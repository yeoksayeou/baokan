<p>— 舒</p>
<p>自去年三月美總統羅斯福接任以來。美國之政治經濟。皆發生劇烈之變化。其外交政策。因亦連帶而受影響。若日美關係。卽極顯著之一例也。　　美國自一九二九年經濟恐慌發生以後。國内產業設備。日見頽廢。而海外市塲。亦頗不振。其猶能維持原狀者。全賴乎其外交運用之微妙。不觀乎九一八事變旣起。美國雖屢交仗義執言。而亦僅適可而止。雅不欲有更露骨之表示。良以美國對於遠東。祗着眼於經濟利益之開發。與銷貨市塲之獲得。今美日兩國之貿易關係。旣届遠東第一位。（按美棉對日輸出占其全國輸出量之半。他如機械鋼鐵木材等。每年價値亦超過五千萬元日金以上。）則美國　　自非至萬不得已時。决不肯對日絶交。而甘受經濟上之損失也。</p>
<p>在日本方面。雖軍國主義者力倡排美之論。而欲日本獨攬太平洋霸權實力仍嫌不足。而况日本對外總輸出中。生絲幾占半數。而生絲輸出。又什九以美國爲尾閭。故美日衝突。亦决非日本對外貿易之利。再就國際政治觀察。日本盡力發揮其武力侵略政策。在我國民。固决無好感可言。卽英日關係。亦貌合神離。而雄倨北方之蘇聯。且整軍備武。以與日本相周旋。日蘇邦交之衝突對立。旣日形尖銳。設使日本再不能在太平洋打開外交出路者。恐不待疆塲之交綏。卽以不流血的經濟戰爭一端。已卽足致其死命矣因此種種日方宣傳對美親善之聲浪。乃高唱入雲。先之以齋藤博之疏通。繼之以近衛文磨之奔走。所謂美日互不侵犯條約之交涉。似有更近一步之可能。　　雖然。美日互不侵犯條約。卽使成立。而太平洋之和平。能否眞正保持。吾人</p>
<p>仍不能無疑。蓋美日諒解。在美國或確具誠意。在日本則别有會心。試觀在美日非正式的初步諒解成立後。日本對於亞東大陸之壓迫。又驟趨嚴重其在華北方面者。驟增津東馬蘭峈日兵至二千餘名之多。且附有飛機多架。使察東邊境亦大感不安。又在僞滿方面。調派名古屋第三師團與京都第十六師團。携帶大宗新式武器。（按日本對於此次調兵。仍以換防爲掩飾。其實經調回國之第八與第十兩師團實力合計。不及第三與第十六兩師團。三分之二。　　以爲充實國際戰爭及覬覦内蒙之凖備。呆見美日關係雖漸次好轉。而亞東大　。則將與</p>

<p>齋藤内閣在六十五議會開會期中、曾屢瀕於危境、照常理講、他早就該没有存續的餘地、荒木辭職、還可以解作日本軍部歷來與政府是分立的、不牽涉到整個的内閣、或有可能、但是商工夫臣與文部大臣、同是重要閣員、同時又以所謂綱紀問題而被迫辭職、内閣却依然存在、這是日本一般人都以爲稀奇的、齋藤所以維持得住的原因、第一·是軍閥與財閥的鬭爭、到現在還没有分顯然的勝負、陸軍方面、雖然可以用强力來奪取政權、但再不能採取五一五那樣、或更進一步的暴力、也不能挑動所謂非常事變、將權力完全集中在軍閥手裏、第二·是財閥祗能消極的保守、决不能作積極的進攻、換言之、就是祗能保持議會政治的軀殼、决不能令議會政治的精神復活、第三·是現在的狀勢之下、找不到一個比齋藤實更適當、更能介在於軍閥與財閥間的妥當人物、因爲幾個候補内閣總理、在人事關係上、在一般的政治主張上、不是偏向於軍部、就是政黨出身、對軍閥與財閥、總有一方面弄不好、結果是都不能上臺、惟有讓齋藤繼續幹下去了、</p>
<p>六十五議會閉幕以後、齋藤内閣的壽命、就不握諸議會之手、而决於坐在漁蔣的西園寺公望元老了、齋藤拜訪西園寺的時候、表示他自己的意見、以爲還可以繼續下去、西園寺也就主張他繼續、勸他勉爲其難、因爲西園寺還是抱着他的憲政常道論、質言之卽不贊成軍閥專政、當然更反對推翻憲法、然則推倒齋藤内閣而荒木上臺、在西園寺的意思、是以爲决不妥當的、所以齋藤内閣、就要講到如何運用積極政策、如何補充文部大臣的實際問題了、</p>
<p>所謂積極政策云者、約有兩大端、第一·是現在已面臨着一九三六年的國際危機、丨華盛頓海軍條約滿期、日本在國聯也從那時起算正式退出、同時還有英日關係與蘇日間種種問題、這些事情、要如何應付、其次是「滿洲」傀儡、已經有了兩只偶人兒到東來、日本全國上下、曾將他們拿着玩了一氣、但是經濟如何提携、打開來講、就是如何從經濟上統制東北四省、對前一個問題的解答、是從外交上着手、特别是對美國的外交、現在牠將凡是鼓吹日美戰爭或反對美國太厲害的著作、都加以取締、除了齋藤博駐美大使發揮外交能率之外、最近將派遣其新起的貴族政治家近衛文磨赴美遊說、務使日美關係好轉、减少牠海上的顧慮、對滿洲的經濟統制、實際上對傀儡、至多不過玩一套手法、於日本的政策、并無妨碍、現在關係最緊要的、還是軍閥與財閥的爭鬭、例如南滿鐵道公司的改組問題、非但關係滿洲經濟、而且要牽連政治、據目前的形勢看、日閥要完全以軍閥統治滿洲、以財閥作其附庸、事實上恐怕有許多困難、結果大槪要另轉一種方式、而經濟的兼併滿洲、那是免不了的罷、</p>
<p>在其他一方面、還有日本國内的問題、卽是刷新敎育的根本政策、米穀對策、以及肅振綱紀的對策、關於敎育、因日本近來一般思想惡化、無論向左向右、都傾向於非法的極端、暗殺陰謀、不斷的發生、這使社會常常動搖、而左傾思想、更足以震撼其上層社會、造成恐怖現象、所以日政府不能不有一種安撫政策、至於米穀問題、是在議會中、在閣議席上、在一般論壇上、爭論過多少次、而眞能見諸實施的結果、還祗有政府收買來屯積的一個方法、所謂肅振綱紀、是講道德的講法、於日本實際政治、大槪不會有什麽大作用的、（四月七日於東京）</p>

<p>— 丨丨答王寅丨丨</p>
<p>王寅君來信，詢及研究敎育的途徑和研究敎育必須具有何種根本知識諸問題。茲特提出我們的意見，答覆如次；</p>
<p>在未入正文以前，讓我們先來問一問王寅君，要研究敎育是抱了怎樣一個目的？</p>
<p>也許，王寅君要以爲、我們這樣實在問得太笨了。一個人做無論那一件事，都是有一種目的的，除非那人是個傻子，才會盲目地亂播。是的，我們相信王寅君是有目的的，然而，問題也就在這裏。同是做一件事，甲抱定某一目的，乙抱定另一目的，則他們的成就和結果必然隨之而各有不同，譬如；製造毒瓦斯吧，有爲了化學工業上的需要而製造，有爲了供給戰爭的需要而製造；前者是於人類社會有利的，後者乃是毁滅人類社會的毒物。我們做事，不僅是抱定目的而已，而且應該抱定正當的目的。出發點錯誤，則你所從事的事業的全盤，均要陷于錯誤。</p>
<p>對于這問題，我們可以在一般研究敎育者的心目中舉出最普遍的幾點意見來作回答。</p>
<p>首先，是那些敎育救國論者。他們把敎育抬上九重天，以爲敎育是萬能；敎能可以挽回「世道人心」，敎育可拯救「垂亡」。他們看到自己的工業不如别國的發達，看到自己的槍砲不如别國的鋒銳，便以爲這是敎育的關係，于是來一回什麽軍國敎育，他們看到民衆瀕於飢餓，看到全國陷于恐慌，也以爲這是敎育的關係，于是來一回什麽職業敎育，生產敎育。試問；這是不是可能的呢？敎育是不是可以挽國運於垂危呢。事實早就給了我們一個明確的回答；二十年來的中國敎育，于民衆，于國家，所收的効果均是很細微的。抱定這樣目的去研究敎育的人，如果不是有意自欺欺人，甘心帮忙那些另有野心的人去欺騙麻醉民衆，那結果一定要陷于絶望，永遠尋不着出路。</p>
<p>其次，是敎育淸高論者，他們認敎育是超越社會的，是不爲世俗所渲染的淸高事業。他們一方面自高身價，固執着「萬般皆下品，惟有讀書高」的成見，另一方面，却把自己從社會内孤立起來，這就是，軍閥由他混戰去，官僚由他貪污去，敎育是不受拖累的，試問；這又是可能的嗎？提倡了十幾年的敎育經費獨立運動，結果仍只有習慣撥敎育經費作軍餉，我們如果不是瞎子，决不致看不見這些事實。假使你一定要自標淸高的話，那除非你願意餓死。可見，走這條路的研究敎育者，是同樣没有出路的。</p>
<p>那末，什麽是研究敎育的正當目的呢？　　一種目的，並不是憑一個人想像來决定的，而是，一方面要根據社會的實際要求，另方一面，應該認淸我們所研究的學問在社會内是扮演怎樣一個角色。</p>
<p>敎育的演進，乃决定於一定的社會生產力與生產關係。原始敎育，是不與人類生活分開的，卽是說，精神勞働是與肉體勞働結合爲一的。跟着生產力的發展，社會上發生了分工，于是乎誕生了階級，于是精神勞働與肉體勞働起了分裂，敎育便不爲勞働者所有，而成了一特權者的專利品，作爲統治民衆的工具之一。在封建社會制度下，統治者怕民衆因爲飢餓而起來反抗，于是便抬出「忠孝節義」的敎育，「餓死是不要緊的，只怕没有廉恥，不能對主人盡忠」，這就是他們敎育的主要任務。到了資本主義社會，因爲資本生產組織，需要有組織的勞働者，各級產業士官，于是有資本主義階位的敎育制度，資本主義敎育的任務一方面，無非爲生產組織繼續不斷的造出生產人員，維持生產過程，他方面爲了擴大市塲佔有市塲的最終目的，于是企圖製造出成千成萬的資本的兵憲。這就是所調軍國敎育愛國敎育的本質；至于生產敎育亦不過集注在提高勞働的强度，增加勞働的生產率，擴大榨取過程。其實，資本主義到了末期，生產合理化的結果，分工愈細，勞働者並不需要專門知識，於是工人敎育更不爲資本家所注决意。現代社會的敎育，更變爲不是爲民衆的，而且必然地是少數人所專有的，所謂民衆敎育，不過是一句空話（未完）</p>

<p>民國二十二年度之國民經濟。一言以蔽之，二十一年度病態之顯著而已！華北一部，河北邊境各縣及察哈爾略受兵災；山東黃河區域，稍受水災；此外各地，均無重大事故，政治漸臻安定，田穫亦見豐收，惟一般農產價格跌落，田地貶價，農民日見困窮；所幸棉花價格之低落，不如其他農產之甚；故河北山東山西陜西河南各省之農村狀况，較之其他各省，尙能差勝。長江中部，四川江西，有共匪之蹂躪；湖南安徽江蘇，受米價慘落及絲茶衰敗之打擊，農民、</p>
<p>收入，尤見減少。華南一部，則華僑匯欵，退減未已，食米仰給國外，社會濟濟枯窘，更甚於長江各省。以中國全體言之，則因喪失鉅額之滿洲出口貿易，致入超數目，日見增加，生金現銀，尤多流出；又因農產價格之低落，致人民購買力愈降愈低，國内工業品之銷路愈見減色，此固病態變遷中應有之現象，必然之結果。唯所當注目者，則二十二年度之病態，泰半由於世界不景氣之反響，不過譬諸孱軀，其忽於衛生者，外感之侵入尤易，顧事愈窮則變愈亟，二十二睥度之病態，二十一年度固已知之；至二十二年度而方知設施之迫切。此一年中，全國上下均知改進農村之不容稍緩；且知改進農村，在消極方面，必須掃除障碍，減輕負擔；在積極方面，必須各種經濟建設，同時並進。於是中央有免除一切苛捐雜稅之通令，及鐵路運輸之改善，運費之減輕，與夫公路鐵路之增築，棉業之統制，合作運動之提倡，凡此各種設施，皆所以爲救濟農村而連煗及之者，雖尙未見有大規模之規畫；然政府當軸，迫於切身利害所關，漸悟培養民力之切要；則今日農村破產之痛苦，焉知非他日農村復興之代價，此二十二年度創深痛鉅之中，所見否極泰來之象，充實而光輝之，是在全國國民之奮起耳！</p>

<p>廿二年度之本行營業，悉根據去年度報告所宣示之方針，減低存欵利率，以杜不自然之信用膨脹；減輕放欵利率，以輕工商業者之負擔；添設内地機關，以期資金之移向内地；增設倉庫，以增進物產之流通，補助農村之金融，雖實行不及希望十之二三，幸以本行與社會關係之深，凡有設施，不乏相當之反響。本年度内地放欵利率，逐漸降低，較之往年有降低二三釐者。内地金融機關之日見增加，各行農村貸欵之相率競進，其中由於本行反響所得之效果亦不在少，豈特一般金融界之幸？亦本行之所可告慰於股東者。唯存息雖减，而存欵不見減少；放息雖低，而各地商户筋疲力盡，難得優良之欠户；各項農產價格，一落千丈，卽貨物押欵，亦隨時有呆滯虧折之慮；故放欵增加之比例，不敵存欵之增，銀行收益，日見徹薄；此則大勢所趨，爲不景氣時代所不可免之事實，當爲吾股東所共諒者，至内地機關及倉庫之添設，一則養成適合内地之人才，二則規畫相當之設備，均非可一蹴而及；故不得不得之以漸。若言金行營業，則南方各行之困難，甚於北方，川省則共匪突起；贛省則共產尙未肅淸；加以閩變之作，一時百業停滯，閩粤兩省錢莊，紛紛倒閉，金融紊亂；所幸當地各行，謹愼將事，未遭鉅大損失；同時對於市面，不惜犧牲，盡务扶持，以免局部金融基礎之動搖。唯値此國家經濟放任政策没落之期，舊式商業金融組織淘汰之日，以本行所處之地位，其應付之難，不言而喻。唯有一秉本行夙抱之穩健主義，對於本身，力求增加效能，減輕成本，以鞏固已有之基礎；對於社會，繼續今日之方針，導金融界入於健全之正軌而已！</p>
<p>（甲）業務槪况</p>
<p>（一）存欵</p>
<p>甲，存欵總額二十二年度各項存欵總餘額爲五三九，二八四，五二七·一六，較二十一年度計增加六二，七三六，四七三，七三。分析比較，則（一）活期存欵餘額爲一八九，七六九，○九○·六八，較二十一年度計增加六·一六八，○三三·○九；（二）定期存欵餘額爲二一一，二○○，八四九·二三，較二十一年度減少二三，四三一，一九八·三六；因本年度將發行保證凖備提存之數五六，八八四，六七○·四七轉出（詳見以下發行兌換券凖備成分一節），故减此數。若加入計算，則較二十一年增加三三，四五三，四七二，一一；（三）同業存欵餘額爲一三八，三一四，五八七·二五，較二十一年度增加七九，九九九，六三九·○○。</p>
<p>乙，存户數目二十二年度存户數目爲一三六，七二九户，較二十一年度又增二二，二三六户，如以十九年度之七六，一二七户爲基本數，可計出存户數目連年增加之指數如下；</p>
<p>十九年度一○○</p>
<p>二十年度一二二</p>
<p>廿一年度一五○</p>
<p>廿二年度一七九</p>
<p>丙，存欵性質二十二年度各項存欵，依照存户之性質，與二十一年度比較，其百分率如左；</p>
<p>年度機關存欵工商業存欵團體及個人存欵</p>
<p>廿一度四、四六三三、八六六一、六八</p>
<p>廿二度四、一四四五、六六五０、二０</p>
<p>（二）放欵</p>
<p>甲，放欵總額二十二年各項放欵總餘額爲三五一，三八八，六○九·一五，較之二十一年度計增加二八，四九七，三九一，三三。分析比較，則（一）活期放欵及透支餘額爲一二五，八四四，五七六·五四·較二十一年度增加二六，四二七，二二八，六一；（二）定期放欵餘額爲一八九，一三八，六九○·五八，較二十一年度减少二九八，三七七·六二；（三）貼現及買進期票餘額爲三六，四○五，三四二·○三，較二十一年度增加二，三六八，五四○·三四。</p>
<p>乙，放欵性質二十二年度入欵，依性質類别比較，其百分率如下；</p>
<p>商業二七，○二，七業一二，○八，農業及農產品四，八一，同業六，五六，機關四三，九○，公用事業○，九七，交通事業一，四一，團體○，七三，個人二，五二，合計一○○，○○。</p>
<p>廿一年度以前，係將農業團體放欵，計入團體類，農產品放欵，計入商業類，交通事業放欵，計入公用事業類，本年度　欲時時省察本行對於農業生產及交通建設究有若何之補助，因增列兩類参區分之。</p>
<p>按照本行匯欵統計，二十二年度全年收匯總數爲七五四，七二一·○○○元，較之二十一年度計增加二，五○六，○○○元。</p>
<p>就全國各區域分析本行國内匯欵之百分率；并與二十一年度比較，可以測證本年度國内外各地資金流動率之增减。</p>
<p>（三）匯欵</p>
<p>區域二十二年度收匯百分率二十一年度收匯百分率</p>
<p>長江流域五九，三四九，五</p>
<p>華北一七，七二二，一</p>
<p>東三省一○，○一六，五</p>
<p>華南一三，○一一，九</p>
<p>再就通商口岸及内地市鎭匯出匯入之比率，而察其趨向，則知全國资金對於口岸都市之向心力，較之去年，爲勢尤烈。</p>
<p>經由本行匯出之百分率經由本行匯入之百分率口岸匯入超過匯出</p>
<p>二十一年度口岸三六，一六三，四二七，三</p>
<p>二十一年度内地六三，九三六，六二七，三</p>
<p>二十二年度口岸二八，四七四，○四五，六</p>
<p>二十二年度内地七一，六二六，六四五，六</p>
<p>更有可注意者，以上海一埠而論；本年度本行匯入總數，計達四三七，七三○，○○○元，佔本行全部國内匯欵百分之五九，三，以與上列口岸匯欵入超比率百分之四五，六對照，可知全國匯欵，趨向口岸；而口岸匯欵，又集中上海；此則輸出入不能相抵之結果，而促成内地資金涸竭之徵象。</p>
<p>（四）國外匯兌</p>
<p>本行國外匯兌業務，向因計算之便利，係先按美金編製統計，再按時價折成國幣。本年度若依金幣計算，外匯業務，較之二十一年度頗有進展。惟因美金兌價跌落，其折合國幣之數目。較之去年，除匯欵及期票外，其餘各項，數字反見减小。</p>
<p>（五）發行兌換劵及貸借對照表凖備科目之改訂</p>
<p>二十二年終本行兌換劵流通總額爲一八三，七二六，九九七，三七，較之二十一年年終流通總額計减少七十萬元。在兌换劵凖備金方面，現金凖備共一一五，八六三，二○二·九○，計合流通總額百分之六三；保證凖備共六七，八六三，七九四。四七，計合流通總額百分之三七。查本行以前對外發表貸借對照表，係就流通額之總數將現金保證兩項凖備連同領券行莊交來凖備，綜列一整個凖備額，其中除六成以上現金及行莊之保證凖備外，所有本行保證凖備部分，實際係以有價證劵及房屋道契等提充，向來卽在内部劃淸界限，另帳記載，另庫存儲。惟在貸借對照表上，此項充作保證凖備之資產，仍包括於營業資產科目之内，未經劃出，祗另於負債方面，存欵項下，照數重列，以明提作凖備而求資產負債之平衡。似此辦法，在資產方面，旣有重複表現之缺點；在資產方面，亦多虚轉之數。本年爰將向來辦法，加以修正，所有提充本行保證凖備之有價證劵四九，八二八，一九九，七○，營業用房產七，○五六，四七○·七七，在貸借對照表上不復分别重列於營業資負科目之下；俾本行所發表之各種資產負債數目，益臻明確。</p>
<p>（六）有價證劵</p>
<p>二十二年年終本行有價證劵總額爲八一，八四七，○四五·九一，（保證凖備部分四九，八二八，一九九，七○，營業部分三二，○一八，八四六·二一）佔全體資產百分之八，九，較二十一年度之六四，五四四，四四六·二一，計增加一七，三○二，五九九·七○。良以定期存欵銳增，爲運用分散起見，故增加如上數，同時以二十二年度内英美金市價猛跌，故將金債成分低增，以求財產價値之穩定。茲將金銀兩種證劵之百分率列左；</p>
<p>二十二年年終二十一年年終</p>
<p>銀幣證劵七七，一五六，一</p>

<p>比年以來，全國都市口岸資金，運轉緩滯，覓取投資途徑，已極困難；更欲於運用之際，除就銀行立塲獲得安全保障外，同時着意於輔助國内生產，紓救經濟恐慌，其困難尤可想見。本年度本行業務工作，有可得而述者；</p>
<p>（一）工業放欵二十二年國内工廠，受農村衰落，外貨傾銷之影響，歇業减工，時有所聞；幸一般工業奮發圖存，其本身尙有相當進步。本行秉素日宗旨，力與工業界深切合作，盡力恊助。本年工業放欵總額達四千二百四十五萬五千四百六十八元，較之去年增加四百零二萬萬零四十五元，卽百分之十强；較前年則增加一千一百二十四萬七千八百十四元，卽百分之三十六，各種工業所占成分如左；</p>

<p>（十七）其他一，二六</p>
<p>照上表所述工業放欵之中，以紗業爲最鉅。所堪幸者，凡經本行輔助之紗廠，雖處驚風駭浪之中，尙能改良工作，振勵圖存；此後擬於技術及管理方面，與以改良之督促，期於經濟力量之外，進而爲精神上之合作；庶銀行工業，兩受其益。（二）農業放欵</p>
<p>（子）農產放欵本年利用本行原有八十餘處之倉庫設備、儘量抵做農產品押欵，以謀穩定物價之初步救濟。二十二年終，農產品抵押品如棉花，繭子，米稻，雜糧，烟葉，茶葉等，計一千九百五十餘萬元；内以棉花爲大宗，計八百十九萬餘元；華北佔晨分之七十，長江流域佔百分之三十。所押棉花數量，約値一千一百萬元。二十二年底市面及廠家存花約一百二十萬擔，値價五千餘萬元，本行承押成分，約占五分之一。</p>
<p>（丑）農民小額放欵本年下期，在各地農産品集散中心，設立農產倉庫十五處，推廣農民小額放欵。其金額大小不拘，有祇一元數角者。利息格外從廉，不逾一分。本年終核准之放欵額度爲一百零一萬二千六百元，實放六十二萬二千餘元，户數有一萬四千五百九十七户。　　（寅）合作社放欵凡合作社辦有成效者，本行卽予放欵，以資輔助，其著要者，爲鄒平鄉村改進會，定縣平民促進會及華洋義賑會三處。</p>
<p>（三）内地機關之增設欲求資金之内向，不得不在内地多設機關、本年度就地方秩序比較安定，交通比較便利，物產聚散中心，添設分枝四十處，計江蘇省内十三處，浙江省内四處，安徽省内四處，湖南省内一處，四川省内五處，河北省内一處，河南省内四處，陜西省内二處，山東省内四處，山西省内二處；連上海本市二處，天津本市一處，瀋屬添設一處，共添設機關四十四處。連舊有機關，共一百八十一處。　　（四）内地放欵之增加及利率之减低本年度所增放欵二千八百餘萬元，試分析其地域，則口岸所增放欵，僅占百分之三十五；内地所增放欵，約占百分之六十五。至利率方面，較往年减至二三厘不等。</p>
<p>（五）内地物產期票之承受凡客商向内地辦貨，均出立各大商埠兌現之期票，交與售貨者，售貨者以之向當地錢莊貼現。年來内地錢莊，逐漸收歇；卽營業者，亦或以能力薄弱；或以運現爲難，均不願踴躍承受期票。辦貨者以内地不靖，不改携現深入；故物產滯銷，農村愈苦，本行有鑒於此，特令内地分支行盡量多做貼現及買進期票，計本年度貼現及買進期票餘額，較上年度增加二百三十餘萬元；以全年累計數目計之，共四萬三千五百二十萬六千元，較廿一年增加一萬零九百四十四萬三千元，此乃間接向内地輸回資金之一途徑。向來内地期票，因由錢莊周轉；故出票及售票客户、均與錢莊相習，銀行購進錢莊貼進之票，例於錢莊負責，不再研求其所自。今銀行旣直接承受期票，卽不得不與產銷兩方周旋，熟知產銷之實况矣。</p>
<p>（六）助成杭江鐵路之完工與延長杭江鐵路，於年底通至玉山，全綫告成，計長三百五十五公里。現每月客運約十萬零五千餘人，貨運約一萬四千餘噸；如與滬杭甬路以距離之長短相較，客運得滬杭甬六分之一强，貨運亦得六分之一强，開支占滬杭甬四分之一弱。祇以市面蕭條，江西邊境，悉爲共匪蹂躪；故貨物運輸未臻發逹。本年閩變之際，軍事運輸，幸未絲毫損傷；卽軍隊車費，亦照章發給。今錢道部及江西省政府决定延長杭江路綫，以實行玉萍綫之建築，先築玉山至南昌一段，工料材料共需一千六百萬元。本行允爲擔任籌畫，以爲完成長江以南東西幹綫之起點，實以欲恢復農村經濟，提高農民之知議與生活程度，鐵路之發展，其急務也。</p>
<h3 id="c178">國際收支平衡問題 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>中國貿易之年年入超，必有一日無法以抵補入超之差額，及購買力之必然國際收入</p>
<p>减退，已於歷屆報告中一再警告國人。至本年則溝渠乾潤，已見端倪矣。購買力之减退，於本年度之入超大减，可以見之。至入超差額之無法抵補，則於銀之出超，足以證之。生銀自民國元年至二十年，除民國三，四，五，六年歐戰期内，略有也超外，幾無年不見入超，因往年之差額尙有無形之入超以爲抵補，至去年則金銀合計，已出多於入。幸有鉅額生金輸出，生銀尙屬入超，但本年雖有鉅量之生金輸出，而生銀反見一千四百餘萬元之出超，此爲貿易史上極罕見之事實；而貨物之輸出，與無形之收入，不足以抵國際之支出，勢必出於以積儲之通貨抵補差額之一途，是國民經濟上，已達於極危險之點，在此情勢之下，吾國民對於國家之國際收支，能茫無所知，而對於國際收支之如何平衡，仍視若無睹乎？</p>
<p>二十二年度國際收支數目之推測中國之國際收支，國内外經濟學者各有臆測，一則數目未能得之正確之統計；二則收支雙方不能得到近似之平衡。本行研究室近由各方面就可能範圍内雖力求正確與近似；但亦何能免前述之缺憾。茲將推測之數，叙述於下，聊作研究國際收支之根據。由此引起各方面之注意，供給較爲精確之資料；以求得到一完善之國際收支表，此又關心國家經濟者所深切屬望者也。</p>

<p>銀價問題照本年情形觀測，入超趨勢，不易改變，則現銀輸出之增加，自在意中。若銀價日見提高；同時或紐約銀價高於銀價之匯兌價値，則輸出增加之速率更鉅。蓋以前銀價之漲落，不過影響於物價；而今後之銀價，因國際收支之關係，更進而影響及於中國之存銀。中國生銀之出超，似起於本年，實則近數年來，固無年不見生銀出超；蓋上海一埠，幾與國外相等；内地輸入上海之現洋，與輸出國外，相差僅一間耳，民國二十年上海存底加五千萬元，二十一年加一萬二千六百餘萬元，二十二年增加一萬零九百餘萬元；但生銀之入超，二十年僅四千五百萬元，二十一年僅二千四百萬元，香港情形亦相類；蓋内地現洋輸入上海，無異準備輸出國外之第一步。内地因現洋集中通商口岸之結果，通貨與信用同時收縮；以致物價慘落，農村衰敗，因内地物價之跌落。人民購買力降低，上海工商，一落千丈；設上海之現銀，再源源流出，則上海之通貨信用，隨之收縮，動產不動產之價値，同時跌落；則上海所存之現銀。正可隨時變化；卽内地所發生之現象，勢必重見於通商口岸；而國民經濟之基礎，有動搖之堪虞。若國外再施以人爲方法，制定法案，提高銀價，則更促進生銀这輸出。以本年上半年言之；籌備倫敦經濟會議開會時，銀價自十六便士半，漲至二十便士半，而中國純輸出生銀三千四百餘萬元；至下半年銀價回落，略有進口，卽其一證。故爲中國計。極願各國繼續倫敦經濟會議時穩定銀價之初旨；而對於人爲過度提高之政策，不敢苟同。至謂提高銀價可以增進中國人民之購買力者，不知中國人民之購買力，因國際收支不能平衝，内地通貨收縮，物價低落，逼至不能不降。非世界物價抬高，中國出口增加。無法恢復人民之購買力。銀價之高下，已在不足重輕之列矣。况各國均取貶價傾銷政策，銀價過高，則國貨工業更受莫大影響，亦非中國所可輕視者也。</p>
<p>對外信用國際收支差額之鉅，其補救之方，不外增進生產；欲求增加生產，必需有改良與建設之資金，若非輸入外資與取得外國信用，則對外之支出更鉅。卽照目前趨勢，亦非有國外信用之援助，已不能維持現有之購買力。惟外國資金與信用之取得，一則有賴於外國輸出資本之能力；二則有賴於中國本身之信用。中國本身信用之厚薄，繫乎政治之安定與外債之整理。本年度政治稍見安定；故關稅擔保之各項外債，均見向上，如善後債票一月份七十三鎊，至十二月份漲至九十鎊五先令；鐵路債務，雖尙無大規模之計劃；幸軍人提用路欵之舊習，業經終止，各路可稍用餘力以整理債務，如滬杭甬及京滬路之中英公司借欵，規定按月提還若干，一年來均能照案履行；道淸鐵路之福公司借欵，按月酌提償還本息；汴洛鐵路比公司借欵，付利息一次，津浦曾付原借欵德發部分三十三期利息一次；續借欵德發部分二十八期利息一次；又補付原借欵德發部分三十三期利息之一部；同時平漢英商料債，按月提付五萬元；津浦英商料債，亦按月提五萬元；平綏路之美商料債，月提美金五千元，以上種種，雖屬爲數極微；然亦爲顧全信用之初步，故本年滬杭甬債票，由八四漲至九折以上；京滬由四一漲至五四。若政府對於鐵路外債，能有通盤整事大計；則鐵路債票之信用，不難向上；中國對外信用增加，外資之輸入自易，此不能不希望政府作進一步之計畫。至若本年度一年間國有鐵路之行政管理，均有改善，非特商民受運輸便捷之惠；亦於鐵路對外信用，裨益非淺焉！</p>
<h3 id="c179">農村救濟 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>農村衰落之原因以國民十之七八務農之國家，而農村衰敗達於斯極，其影響於國民經濟至爲重鉅；故農村救濟，爲二十二年度重要之一大問題，與金融界更有深切之關係。茲將農村衰敗之原因，次第列舉；</p>
<p>一，農產價格之慘落山東濟南之小麥價格，二十年度之平均價格每擔爲五元二角八分，二十二年之平均價格爲四元三角二分；蕪湖米價，二十一年平均爲九元一角一分，二十二年爲六元一角七分；靑島之花生行市，由二十一年之平均價格每擔十三元跌至二十二年度之九元五角；山東靑州烟葉，二十一年平均每擔値十六元五角，二十二年僅値九元。據稅則委員會調查之上海躉售價格，二十二年之米價，當二十年之五五％，二十一年之八一％；二十二年之麥價，當二十年之七六％，二十一年之八○％；二十二年之茶價，當二十年之四三％，二十一、</p>
<p>年之五九％；二十二年之繭價，比二十年落四三％；二十二年之花生價，比二十年落四○％，比二十一年落二○％；棉花價格，跌落最微，二十二年之行市，當二十年之八</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>一％，二十一年之八七％，同時農民需要品價格之低落，不如農産品價格之甚，如二十二年之棉紗價，平均比二十年落二四％，比二十一年落九％；二十二年之粗布價，比二十一年祇落二％，照此推算，設以農產品交換棉紗一包，在民國二十年僅需白米十九石；紅茶八十三斤；乾繭一百四十二斤；花生二十四擔；在二十一年需白米二十三石；紅茶一百斤；乾繭二百斤；花生二十七擔；至二十二年則需白米二十六石；紅茶一百五十三斤；乾繭一百七十八斤；花生三十一擔。因農產之跌價，農民入不敷出；據中央農業實騐所在江寗縣之調查；二十二年度每一成年農夫平均消費支出需五十二元，農業收入僅四十二元，其入不敷出之數竟達十元；卽收入之數，僅當支出之百分之八十。</p>
<p>二，農民負擔之有增無減據中央農業實騐所六百八十七縣之報告；農民負擔稅捐，仍有增無减。各省合計；水田稅率，在二十年當田價之二，○七％，二十一年當二，三七％，二十二年則當二，六八％，卽二十二年之負擔較二十年約增百分之三十；旱田稅率，在二十年當田價之二，三六％，二十一年當二，五○％，二十二年當二，八○％，卽二十二年比二十年約增百分之二十，考江蘇省地主之田租收入及其負擔，二十年田租收入九元，田稅支出一元三角，餘數七元七角；二十一年田租收入七元八角，田稅支出一元七角，餘數六元一角；二十二年田租收入七元四角，田稅支出二元七角，餘數四元七角；故地主投資買田，二十年得週息七厘七，二十一年得六厘一，二十二年只得四厘七。</p>
<p>三，外國農產品跌價之反響二十二年度外國農產品輸入數量，雖較二十一年略爲减少；然其價格低落，不特時時威脅中國農產品之價格，使之無法向上；其輸入中國之數量，已定間接壓倒中國之農產。而美國棉麥借欵，亦與中國棉麥價格有極大之影響。</p>
<p>四，農產收穫量之不豐中國農產收穫，一以耕地面積之不大；二以生產方法之退化；故農產收穫量並不豐盛。全國可耕種之地，有一，四六二，六八二方里；而耕地不過三二二，四四三方里，占百分之二十二。外國麥之收穫豐，每公頃以ＩＯＯ基羅計，加拿大爲一○，九；美國爲九，九；澳國爲七，四；中國爲七·三。米之收穫量，日本爲三四·二；意大利爲四六·四；台灣爲二二·九；中國爲一八·九（以上爲一九二八至一九三一年之平均數）。查民國二十年中國糧食之收穫量，爲一·五五八，○○○·○○○擔，二十一年爲一·六九八·○○○·○○○擔，二十二年爲一·五八六·○○○·○○○擔；卽較之前年祇增收百分之二，比去年則少百分之六；棉花產量，二十二年較二十年多收百分之二十，較二十一年多收百分之三十五；但產量增加之原因，由於種植面積之增加。非生產品这增加。</p>
<p>因農村衰敗，以致農地價値，日益低落。各省綜計；水田價格，去年較前年跌落六％，本年；較前年跌落一二％；旱地價格，去年跌落七％，本年跌落一一％。故北方往日每畝値價一百五十元之地，今雖貶價至三四十元，無人過問；南方亦幾跌半價，仍無受主；骠致農民極難以田地抵押現金。昔年以農民借欵負擔利息之重，爲世所詬病，今日則雖負重利，亦難借到現欵矣。</p>
<p>救濟之設施旣知農村衰敗之由，不外農民之經營成本大而收得之價値小；卽知救濟農村，一面須減輕農業成本；一面須提高農產價格。</p>
<p>本年政府及社會言面對於减輕農業成本及提高農產價格之設施；</p>
<p>一，政府通令取沙苛捐雜稅；但各省尙未有减低或取消之切實舉動。</p>
<p>二，金融機關提倡農民放欵；各銀行或則設農業倉庫，試辦小額放欵；或則提倡合作社之間接放欵；但總額不足六七百萬元。利率减至一分與八厘之間。</p>
<p>三，政府征收洋米進口稅生擔一金單位全洋一元九角五分；洋麥進口稅每擔○，三○金單位合洋五角九分；洋粉進口稅每擔○，七五金單位合洋一元四角七分；但洋米入口最多之廣東廣西福建。尙未實行征收，　　四，金融機關添設倉庫，增做農產押欵。</p>
<p>至若中央及各省辦理農業改進之機關，其數如左；</p>
<p>行政及設計四十六</p>
<p>試騐及研究一百六十一</p>
<p>推廣三百零七</p>
<p>農業金融五十八</p>
<p>但所辦各種機關，類以經費拮据規模狹隘，力量有限，進行遲緩。此外，合作社數目之增加。不無足述，别其種類，列表如左；</p>

<p>考各國政府，無不以國家之全力用種種方法，救濟農業；而中國農村之衰敗，已至於此極，而救濟之設施，僅如上述，對於國家經濟前途，實不能不抱深切之憂慮；蓋如積弱之身，必須施以重補之劑，非空言衛生與輕微藥石所能起死而回生。中央地方，設能合籌數千萬鉅額資金，而有通力合作之組織；同時整理田賦附稅，酌量减輕，或可徐圖挽救。我可悲可痛之滿洲其所謂中央銀行尙以千二百萬元作低利貸金，接濟春耕，每畝一元，中國之大，豈數百萬元所可濟事耶？若夫商業金融機關，雖未嘗不可略盡提倡之責；然究不能完全以田地及信用爲擔保，以救最急最窮之農民；故澈底的救濟，終非政府之實力補助不爲功。在社會方面，惟有急切養成服務農村工作之人員，及鼓勵已有相當敎育之靑年，從事鄉村工作。我金融界則希望各銀行繼續其已有之工作，提倡合作社之普及，輔助運銷之改善，亦盡其一分之責而已矣！</p>

<p>棉花二十二年度全國棉作，在下種時雨水得宜，發芽時又天氣順適，發育甚茂；加以北方各省，地方漸見安靖；故棉田棉產均增；尤以山西湖北增加最大。其略受損害者，不過山東黃河流域，湖北沿江一帶之一小部份，及江浙兩省略受風雨打擊而已，據中華棉業統計會調查；全國棉田，計四千零四十五萬三千九百五十三畝，比二十年多八百八十一萬六千一百七十四畝；比二十一年多三百三十五萬四千一百五十三畝；卽比二十年多百分之二十八；比二十一年多百分之九。全國棉產額爲九百六十二萬一千二百四十擔，比二十年增三百二十二萬一千四百六十擔；比二十一年增一百五十一萬五千六百零三擔；卽比二十年多百分之五十；比二十一年多百分之十九，產量增加之多，實爲自民八以來之最大產額。</p>
<p>茶葉產茶區域，友江西安徽福建湖南湖北浙江等省爲最著。年來或因銷路减色；或因匪患頻仍，茶葉產量大减，中國種茶面積及茶葉產額，並無凖確統計，據實業部極槪括的推算，種茶面積，在三百萬义左右；茶葉葉額，在四百萬與五百萬擔之間；而種茶面積與產量之逐年减退，則可斷言。據海關報告；二十年出口値五千一百八十餘萬元，二十一年値三千八百五十餘萬元，二十二年僅値三千四百二十餘萬元。</p>

<p>運銷組織，將運費减低；加以政府實力之援助，卽不難奏效，至棉花生產，目前確不足供給各紗廠之用；尤以細絨生產不足，每年需仰給洋棉約三十萬包。但豫西齊東陜中均可出產細絨美棉，若政府以全力奬勵，必可逐年增加產量，則洋棉進口，自然减少。至小麥與麫粉，則中國產量，尙可自給，祇須運銷方面加以改良，廠家卽可不購洋麥。最難者爲糖，因洋糖進口之結果，糖之原料如甘蔗，蘿蔔之種植，日見减少；現在提倡製糖，必自提倡種植原料始。茲不能不有一言者，中國欲遏止農產品進口之增加，固不能不求之於農業根本改進；惟治標之策，不可偏廢。竊謂增加進口稅實爲目前提倡農產自給之有效方法，如二十二年江浙加徵洋米進口稅以後，洋米之進口大减。設進口稅率能與生產運銷之改善同時並進，逐漸提高，則國燫不難自給。至小麥與麫粉之進口稅率，每擔祇○·三○金單位合洋○·五八六，較之日本每擔小麥徵二元二角五分相差太遠。若小麥進口稅加至一金單位，麫粉加至一·五○金單位，庶與日本稅庇，相去不遠。蓋麥粉兩項，中國未嘗不可自給，故稍增稅率，與民食無大妨礙。至棉花雖云不能自給；惟若能徵收相當之進口稅，則中國棉花，價格提高，農民植棉，自然增加。卽慮細紗價格，或因徵稅而提高；然减少細紗之消費，亦未始非奬勵節約之一道。故欲挽救農村衰落，提倡農產自給，希望政府對於農產進口稅則，加以深切之考慮；卽爲與中國有貿易關係之友邦計，非中國早日恢復農業，無以提高中國人民之購買力，當亦不能不予以同情者也。</p>

<p>二十二年度於中國貿易占主要關係者，爲美，英，日三國，分述於左；</p>
<p>美國年來美國對華進口貿易，以國際開係之良好，及交通之便利，常能保持其優越之地位。二十二年度，進口數目大减，自四萬一千九百三十七萬五千元减至二萬九千七百四十六萬八千元；在中國進口總値中，占百分之二一，八六，比二十一年减百分之三，五七，中國仰給於美國者，爲棉花，麥粉，烟葉，煤油，汽油，木材，大半均爲原料品。煤油，汽油等雖有蘇俄油之競爭，仍未减少，占進口第一位，計七千五百九十餘萬元。棉花以中國棉產豐收，棉紗銷路减色，自去年之一萬五千六百餘萬元减至六千六百五十餘萬元。烟葉以中國豐收及紙烟統稅增加，烟廠趨向中國低價原料，自去年之三千六百餘萬元，减至二千六百餘萬元。美國麥粉價格，不能與澳國競爭；故美麥進口，幾將絶跡；粉自去年之三千四百餘萬元，减至一千一百餘萬元；木材略有增加；此外則飛機，車輛，增加較鉅，中國輸入美國之貨，以桐油爲大宗，出口增加，自去年之一千四百萬元增至二千一百萬元；皮張自去年之一千四百萬元增至二千萬元；生絲自去年之一千三百五十餘萬元增至一千五百二十餘萬元；羊毛增加最鉅，去年爲一百七十餘萬元，未年爲一千一百餘萬元。中國對美貿易，進口爲二萬九千七百四十六萬八千元；出口爲一萬一千三百十四萬六千元，相差一萬八千四百三十二萬二千元。觀察中　　英國英國進口貿易，以排斥日貨之結果，由第三而躍居第二位。本年進口，自一萬八千五百七十萬元减至一萬五千四百萬元，比上年减百分之十七，在中國進口總値中，占百分之一一，三三，與上年相差無幾。進口大宗，爲五金，棉布，機器，呢絨，絨線，硫酸錏。棉布一項，一以日貨之競爭；二以中國國貨工業之進步；三以中國稅率之增加；故自上年三千六百餘萬元减至一千九百餘萬元。五金以鐵路建築及國貨工業需要材料之增加；故自二千二百餘萬元增至二千九百餘萬元。機器及工具以本年市面衰落，各種工業，均鮮擴充。减少三百餘萬元。絨線，呢絨，略有减少，出入不鉅。硫酸錏亦見减少，中國輸入英國之貨，以蛋類，茶葉，猪鬃，駝羊毛，草帽，桐油，毛地毯等爲大宗。蛋類自去年之二千四百五十餘萬元減至二千一百九十餘萬元，減百分之十一。茶葉自四百五十七萬元減至三百八十四萬元。鬃猪自二百九十六萬元减至二百五十一萬元。草帽，毛地毯，略有增加。由上數觀之，可知中國輸出英國貨物之微，出口價値自去年之五千八百五十萬元，减至四千八百七十六萬元，入超之數，達一萬零五百二十七萬餘元。以中國建設之進展，及鐵路之增築、恐五金，機器及鐵路材料之仰給於英國者，必日有增加；而中國可供英國需要之貨，則寥寥無幾，此中英兩國人士所應研究之問題也。</p>
<p>日本日本對華貿易，一以排斥日貨影響；二以東北貿易數目剔除；故大爲低降。進口爲一萬三千二百萬元，占進口總値百分之九，七一；較二十一年度减九千八百八十餘萬元，卽减百分之四二，八。大宗進口貨，爲棉織品三千三百餘萬元；糖九百二十八萬元；各種機械六百二十餘萬元；化學產品五百八十餘萬元；海產五百三十餘萬元；金屬製品五百四十餘萬元；紙五百二十餘萬元；煤四百六十餘萬元；橡皮製品五百五十餘萬元。出口品自去年之一萬六千七百四十六萬元減至九千五百八十萬元；在中國出口總値中，自百分之二一，八○減至百分之一五，六五。出口大宗，首爲棉花二千二百餘萬元；次則棉紗，多爲在中國之日本廠家所輸出，計一千三百餘萬元；麩糠五百九十餘萬元；子仁八百十六萬元；子餅及雜糧製品四百七十九萬餘元；　四百十二萬元；餘爲金屬礦砂，猪鬃，凍肉，皮類等，其數甚微。但日本對中國之貿易，若包含東北計算，則大見增加；是日本所失之於中國者，已收之於東北；而中國之所失者，則已不可復得矣！日本進口貨之入超，計三千六百餘萬元，目前入超，雖似不鉅；然本年度日貨以賤價傾銷，已漸見效，恐明年度之入超，將大於本年度之數。</p>
<p>此外較有關係者，爲香港，澳洲，德國，印度等處。香港除本身貿易外，尙爲中國與其他各國貿易承轉之地。自香港輸入中國之貨，計四千八百二十八萬元；自中國輸入香港之貨，爲一萬二千零九十五萬元。故中國輸入香港之貨，居中國出口之第一位，占出口總値之一九，七五。大宗貨品，爲礦砂錫塊等値二千餘萬元，絲織品及布疋一千二百餘萬元，此乃國貨工業進歐之結果；禽獸類七百九十餘萬元；藥材香村七百萬元；棉紗四百七十萬元；挑繡品四百三十萬元；菓品在百六十萬元；花生油二百七十萬元；桐油二百六十萬元；此外則花生，海產，鮮蛋，茶，紙等共五千九百萬餘元。自香港輸入之貨，大宗爲糖九百三十餘萬元；魚介海產品六百八十萬元；藥材及香材四百三十萬元；其他爲檀香，米穀，顏料，書籍，毛織品等一百餘種，共値七千二百餘萬元。故香港貿易在中國貿易上，實有注意之價値；而並有維持良好關係之必要。澳洲麥佔輸入洋麥之八成，其進口價値，自去年之六千三百五十萬元增至八千五百七十萬元。德國進口貨値，年見增加。印度方面，出口略有增加。</p>
<p>綜核中國之輸出品，十之八九爲農產品；欲求入超之减少，不外减少農產品之輸出，與增加農產品之輸出。查近三年農產之輸出數量，其價値如左；</p>
<p>年份主要農產輸出總値</p>
<p>民國二十年四二一、０００、００００元民國二十一年Ｘ二五三、０００、０００元民國二十二年Ｘ二四一、０００、００００元　　Ｘ民國二十一年份，僅包含東北各埠一月至六月份之數字，民國二十二年份，則已全無東北各埠之數字矣。</p>
<p>此近三年間主要農產輸出總値逐年遞减，一以東北大宗農產之剔除；二以世界不景氣，各國紛紛加稅以限制進口；三則市價低落，中國農產品之銷路與售値，日益减少。在此情勢之下，欲求農產輸出之增加，若論治本，要在品質改良，種類劃一，成本减輕；若言治標，宜將主要輸出農產品免除出口稅；誠以此種出口稅爲世界各國所絶無僅有者，政府當注重國家經濟，不宜斤斤於此數千萬之收入也。</p>
<h3 id="c182">二十二年之工業 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>中國工業，發達較早範圍較廣者，首推紗廠，粉廠，絲廠；次則捲烟，火柴二業；其新興而範圍較小者，爲日用品工業。粉廠之進展，已至相當限度；紗廠則年有擴充；惜近以人民購買力薄弱，銷路狹隘；故紗粉兩業，其經營不甚得法者，卽遭虧折；絲業則以絲價跌落，十九不能支持；捲烟，火柴二業，嵵</p>
<p>以競爭劇烈，統稅加高，除少數基礎鞏固乾外，均難獲利。至新興之日用品工業，正在發揚滋長之秋，至去年而呈露艱窘銷沉之象，則一二八事變，及農村衰落之影響，有以致之也。故以全般工業論；二十二年度可稱工業界困苦時期之開始；若以地域論；則内地之廠，接近原料產地與消費市塲，故成本較之通商口岸岸之廠，得以輕减，所以本年内地紗廠粉廠營業，較勝於上海，天津，漢口各廠，顧内地與租界地之中國工業，無不時受二重威脅；卽在中國所設外國工廠之競爭，及外國同樣進口品之傾銷，此經營工業者之時時引爲深憂者也　　紡織業二十二年度棉紗價格跌落之鉅，爲十年來所未有。二十一年度標紗最低價爲一百九十三元，本年度爲一百六十六元；本年上海客帮銷路，僅二十一年之七成，不及二十年之半數；若與災患以前之十九年相較，南方及長江均减其半，北方則祇减五十分之一。據二十二年三月調查數目，全國紗錠，計五百零一萬九千九百十七枚，較去年增加三十二萬二千六百三十七枚，較前年增加五十七萬五千六百十七枚。在此種現象之下，不得不各謀生存；於是外商紗廠與中國紗廠相競，内地紗廠與通商口岸之紗廠相競，北方紗廠與南方紗廠相競，競爭愈烈，生存愈苦，槪括言之；全國紗廠，虧多盈少；卽稍有盈餘者亦逈不如去年，若以日本紗廠與中國紗廠較，則日本紗成本愈减愈輕，出品日見精良；復有南洋印度之出路；故逈非中國紗廠所可望其項背。以内地紗廠與通商口岸之廠相較，則内地紗廠工人易於訓練管束，工作效力較高；且或則接近消費市塲；或則接近原料產地；故勝於通商口岸之廠實多。北方紗廠，向以東北爲大宗尾閭；近則去路斷絶；故營業較之南方紗廠，更屬艱難。顧以適者生存之原則言之；競爭愈烈，則改進愈速，其缺乏智識，管理腐敗者，自然淘汰；其技術精良，管理合理者，卽能生存，本年度中國紗廠之中，試一加分析，已有顯著之比較；况以中國人口之多，此五百萬紗錠，每百人約占一枚；以六千萬人口之日本，尙有八百萬紗錠；則中國紗業前途，烏可視爲已達高限？同時國產棉布因有進口稅則逐漸提高之保護，與外貨競爭較易；故爲中國紗廠計，宜奮進减輕成本，改良生產，以厚其競爭之實力；一方宜擇銷紗較多或原料供給較便之内地，設廠經營，以避外廠之壓迫。今棉業統制會對於植棉改良，已積極進行；則内地之原料供給，更見充分，此爲經營紗業者之所不宜忽視者也。中國紗廠與日本紗廠之比較如左華廠日廠</p>

<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>路向以東北爲大宗；次則北方。國粉之銷於東北者，約有四百萬包，近不過數萬包；北方近有日粉俄粉廉價傾銷，天津當地粉廠，已受打擊；南方粉廠之去路更狹，則以南粤一帶，地方不靖，人民購買力薄北，商家不敢屯貨；尤以本年各地麥子豐收，鄉村農民，食用土磨之粉，粉銷更滯同時美國粉麥借欵之成立，正値新麥上市之際；於是粉價狂落開數十年未有之低價，自二元六七角跌至二元左右。各廠存貨堆積，上海存貨最高之額，達三百餘萬包；天津，漢口，亦有二百餘萬包。不得已於中秋節後，宣告停工。後以工人生計，輪流開車。其停閉者。有天津之民豐及寗波之立豐。以本年度麵粉業大體言之；原料與粉價同時並跌，其隨製隨抛者。大半尙可獲利；且不若紗業之有外商競爭，祗須謹愼從事，不至有大虧損；近復有洋粉進口稅之徵收，廠商不無喘息之機。　　繅絲業二十二年度業絲者以上年度多數虧折，均謹愼從事；卽農民養蠶，亦不敢擴大。差幸天時順利。繭量較多，繭價不大，廠商購進春繭後、絲價忽漲，稍能獲利。及夏秋二熟，繭價抬高；而外國絲市，步步趨跌，廠商均反盈爲折。本年度出口，較上年雖增加百分之十八；然絲價之跌，則甚於上年。美銷絲價，上年度最高八百九十五元，最低六百四十元；本年度最高九百九十元，最低則僅五百元左右；且最高之價，不過曇花一現，按本年度日本產絲，較上年增加百分之九，二，卽五萬擔；而美國消費，减少八萬四千擔；同時人造絲之產量，日益增加。以中國生絲出數之少，成本之高，品質之次，運銷機關之不健全，一旦受此種種世界潮流之壓迫，其不能立足，固不待言。本年春秋繭本，平均在七百元，加繅絲工資及其他開支約一百五十元，卽每擔成本，約須八百元以上。乃絲價跌至五百餘元，是以業絲者十九虧折。江浙兩省絲廠，共一百一十餘家，而年底繼續開工者，祗上海廠五六家，無錫十餘家，浙江六七家。卽不及十分之二。故絲業之衰敗，已達極嚴重之時期，今後非改良原料，改進技術，根本革新，無法挽救。而此改良原料與改進技術之途徑，非由近代科學化之方法不爲功。非舊日之因循補救所可爲力。今有絲業改良委員會之設立，從事於根本改進之工作；絲業中亦不乏具有新知識者，以近代之方法，經營管理，困苦奮鬥，不得謂爲無復興之望也。</p>
<p>捲烟業年來國貨捲烟，銷路漸廣，中國捲烟廠之設立，風起雲湧，曾達一百五十六家之多。其中範圍較大，設備完全者，不過數家。本年度以統稅加重，各地土製捲烟充斥，並以人民購買力之薄弱；故各廠管業，逈不如前，小廠紛紛停閉，現所剩不過五六十家。二十年中國廠統稅數目，多於英美烟公司，二十一年份則漸相等，本年度則少於英美。今後小廠之難以立足，大廠之必須改進，已屬情勢顯然。其可値研究者，中國烟廠之與英美烟公司之對峙，正如中國紗廠與日本紗廠之關係。惟山西省政府自辦捲烟廠，以政府之力推銷出品，現英美捲烟每月在山西之銷路，已不能超過山西自辦烟廠銷烟之三分之一；而山東省政府近亦有奬勵中國自辦烟廠出品之舉，此爲捲烟業新傾向之一端　　火柴業中國火柴業，自民國十六年起，逐漸衰落；至十八，十九年大有岌岌不可終日之勢。至二十年一月實行增加關稅後，外國火柴進口减少，中國廠家，漸有轉機，此一年間，爲營業最安定之年。二十一年起，重入黯淡，各廠相率跌價。本年度各廠營業，大廠尙可支持，小廠痛苦萬狀，其重大原因，在各廠生產量漫無限制，如十八年之出數，不過六十萬箱，至十九年增至七十萬箱，二十年仍恢復六十萬箱，至二十一年忽復增至七十三萬箱；但因加稅而减少進口之外柴，不過五萬餘箱。各廠不問銷路，任意增加生產，以致跌價競爭，以前每箱售價五十三四元者，現僅售四十元；以前售價二十元者，現僅售十二元左右，其售價僅及成本或至不及成本者。故火柴業本身，若不亟圖聯合，限制生產，恐將均有不能支持之一日。全國火柴廠，共五十餘家；外商所設立者有七家；但出數約占華廠四分之一，是中國火柴廠勁敵尙存焉。</p>
<p>日用口工業橡膠業以新廠增多，生產過剩，存貨山積，價値跌落，以前上等貨套鞋每打售價十一二元者，現降至八九元；至小廠次等貨，祇售五元餘；存貨聞有四百餘萬雙。上海大小橡膠廠五十餘家，本年停頓收歇者，逹五分之一以上；而所剩三分之二之中，其營業較勝者，不過六七家。化妝品業有四五十家。本年營業總量，當在七百萬元左右。大者六七家，均尙獲利；小者營業平平。肥皂工業，年來亦甚發達，大小五十餘家；規模較大者，不過十餘家。其出品不特運銷國内；並有一部份運銷南洋一帶。搪瓷業上海有十餘家。本年營業平平，其營業總量，約四百餘萬元。製酸爲年來新興工業之一，現有製酸廠二家，電燈池業計十餘處，其大者每日可出一萬五千隻；小者自二千隻至六七千隻不等。每月約可出一百三十餘萬隻；年產約一千二三百萬隻；日貨進口，年約六七百萬隻；在中國外廠出貨，亦有六七百萬隻；而中國全年需要不過一千六七百萬隻；故供過於求；加以外貨跌價傾銷，各廠營業，難以獲利。針織業上海大小廠家二百餘家，本年營業，約减少百分之三十八。食味品業，廠數過多，紛紛低價競爭，已有數家不能支持而停歇者。全年營業，不過三四百萬元。毛綸業近稍見萌芽，天津東亞廠營業尙佳。此外製鹼及機製石粉，絲光棉織等業，業務總量不鉅，無大出入　　最近三年國貨工業之消長情形茲就調查各該業最近三年營業額之消長指數，錄述如左；但未敢認爲絶對正確。（假定民國十九年度之營業額爲一００）</p>

<p>經濟統制與通貨膨脹，成爲世界各國保護物業，救濟民生之一大工具。吾國朝野人士，懍於產業之衰落，外貨之壓迫，盛唱仿行之議。最初有江浙兩省政府會同絲業界金融界設立江浙蠶絲統制委員會；次則經濟委員會有棉業統制委員會之設立；此外山西省政府变成立經濟統制研究機關，凖備各項統制計劃。以中國國民知識之淺陋；新興產業基礎之薄弱，欲以經濟復興之責，期之國民之自覺自動，誠不啻河淸之難俟。若以世界各匣統制之成規，爲中國救濟產業之唯一捷徑，又恐不特不能收效，反足以妨礙產業發達之進行。蓋各國之產業統制，大半由於產業發達以後之生產過剩；而中國之病，則在於生產之退化與不足；故各國趨重於價格販賣及生產量與需要量之統制；而中國所當注意者，在於品種等級之統制；欲改進品種等級，不能不有賴於農民之生產敎育，職工之技術敎育，此爲各國發達產業之普通基本條件，任何國家不能躐等。是產業統制，非不可行；但進行階段不可不分，宜從統制品種入手；一面宜圖生產敎育與職業敎育之普及。其統制範圍，當以政治權力運用之所及爲限度；統制之推行，當視統計及人才之凖備爲轉移。亦有主張貿易統制者。所謂貿易統制，意在增加輸出，減少輸入；但其先决條件，亦在是否有品質優良，等級劃一之出口？並是否具有充分供給之數量？否則卽有需要而無供給，雖欲統制而不可得。其主張通貨膨脹之說者，不外以農產物價低落，生產資金缺乏，思藉通貨膨脹之機能以增加資金數量，抬高農產價格。尙有主張减輕貨幣成色，以達通貨膨脹之目的；且藉以抵抗美國銀價之過度提高者。但通貨膨脹之作用，稍具經濟知識者，類能道之；不過有前提焉，卽中國是否已有健全之通貨？猶如先有完善之機械，方可盡機械之效能。今日中國輔幣成色價格之不劃一；銀行發行紙幣之無系統；廢兩改元後之銀元信用，尙在試騐時期；故國民心且中所信用者，乃貨幣之實質，而非代表實質之通貨，通貨之信用未立，何由盡其伸縮之機能？故通貨膨脹之理論，亦非不可行；而建立完善之通貨制度，乃爲先决條件。國人對於幣制改革之議，視爲老生常談。若此基本工作，一日不舉，各國儘有良法美意，不能移之中國，則敷陳理論，何異過屠門而大嚼。深望政府將昔日研究之各種貨幣改革，重加審議，於最短期内成立一完善可行之制度；俾中國通貨，亦得盡其挽救國民經濟之機能，尤望國人勿徒以統制經濟與通貨膨脹爲新頴之捷徑，而竟忘建設之大本耳！</p>
<h3 id="c184">財政金融之健全性 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>國同經濟形勢之嚴重，治療之迫切，已如上述；乃返觀目前政府之財政實况，及社會之金融組織，猶不能無背道而馳之慨。中央政府全年收入六萬八千餘萬元，而支出八萬二千八百九十餘萬元，每年不足之數，恒在一萬四千餘萬元；而用之軍費者，居其大半。生年發行公債之數，除二十一年份外，常在票額一二萬萬元；二十二年度亦發行一萬二千四百萬元，社會僅有之資金。悉爲厚利之公債所吸收；而人人歎息痛恨於建設生產資金之缺乏。無生產資金，何以求生產之改良增進而得貿易之平衡？無經濟建設，何以裕人民之購買力而促物價之提高？上海華商銀行二十二年度發行額爲四萬五千四百十四萬三千一百六十五元，較二十一年增二千三百餘萬元；存欵總額約計爲二十一萬萬元。較之去年約增一萬萬元。上海一埠，添設新銀行六家，原有銀行增設分支行辦事處十六家，均以乏優良厚利之投資而傾向於公債地產；其注意於商業者，亦以放欵途徑之狹隘，於欠户信用押品折扣，不暇審愼選擇；不合理之信用膨脹，日甚一日，在此不健全之財政金融狀况之下，若政府視公債價格之上漲，爲政府信用提高之表現；銀行視游金之充斥，爲社會富力增加之象徵，則有大謬不然者。更有一可注意之事實，卽外國銀行庫銀存底，日見增高，去年占百分之四二·二二，本年占百分之五○·三五；若國家用度不知節約；人民生產不能增進；輸出不加，輸入不减；則現銀趨入外商銀行之傾向，將日益加甚；而人民富力，益見低减，焉知無存欵减少，信用收縮之一日；而公債價格之難於維持，公債發行之無途消納，皆意中事。此對於財政金融前途，不得不引爲深憂者也。補救之策，唯有政府切實大减軍費，屏除不急之支出；减少公債發行，增加生產建設資金；金融界應减輕利率，低减成本，謀實力之蓄積，爲不時之凖備；同時政府應年省一二千萬元，立一减債基金，整理内外債，以樹對外信用，而引外資之輸入；一面立一中央與地方調和之發行制度，以期幣制之確立，通貨信用與數量之增加，吾金融界渴望於財政金融之健全，已若干年，今眞有刻不容緩之勢矣。</p>

<p>參加遠東籃球選預第一賽上海對湖北、昨晚八時在棒球塲露天球塲舉行觀者三四百人、上海因初十分鐘内这鬆懈、致成狂瀾之局面，往後更換陣綫、力圖發展、雖於下半時中曾一度以二十九比二十七超出、卒以三十九比四十三慘敗、湖北隊人材出色陣容緊凑、戰勝上海、非偶然也、今晚八時、由上海對南京比賽、</p>
<p>兩隊實力上海後衛未見十分盡力、陸孫二君、功過互有、前鋒錢馮二將、操之過、屢誤戎機、陳祥龍穩健非常、得分累累、爲表演之最佳者、湖北隊吳國霖之守衛、殊爲得力、陳盛魁驍勇如昔，爲合隊之棰柱石、于敬孝名不虚傳、唯一之中鋒人材、葛克亦不弱、王健明十分努力、全隊實力充足、聯絡純熟、不若上海之慌張抖亂也、</p>
<p>陣容不整上海最初由胡正渠、周達雲、丘廣夑、陳宗祺、張錦祥五人出塲、一籌莫展、對手雖一再犯規、但均交臂失之、二比十、而至五比十六、形勢岌岌可危，乃將五人完全調下、重整旗鼓、陳祥龍一再建功、湖北則方興未艾、上半時成十五比二十五、上海失利、</p>
<p>上海超出休息期中、汽油燈連滅數盞、並被球擲碎兩只、重行調換、延遲五分鐘始開賽、但因少四燈、光綫較暗、上海力圖反攻、聲勢極盛、陳祥龍連中三元、孫寳慶還敬二只、共得十分、而成二十五比二十五之平手、以爲滬隊轉機有望、未幾、湖北葛克投中、又以二十七比二十五佔先、上海再接再厲、孫陳再建奇功、比數突出前茅、以二十九比二十七反佔優先、</p>
<p>卒遭敗北至此滬隊似有直搗黃龍之希望、安知相持未久、葛克還中、再成平手、吳陳兩次中鵠、三十一比二十九、滬隊依然屈服、往後又成三十二比三十二、三十四比三十四、不料從此以後、</p>
<p>滬隊屢失衣機、而球戰亦愈爲激烈、滬隊前鋒失於荒疏、湖北乘時奮起、陳盛魁葛克相繼得分、扶搖直上、四十一比三十四、滬隊最後掙扎、成三十八比四十一、卒以時間已到、無法挽回、遂以三十九比四十三惜敗、裁判員金兆均與吳嘉棠、</p>

<p>（一百公尺）出席者僅五人、爲衆注目之劉長春、袖手旁觀、雖報名未出席、據去擬致全力於二百公尺、其他如王季淮·徐鑣·郝春德亦未參加、第二次開槍後、才出發、形勢殊平均、　六十公尺、方見高低、程金冠趙秉衡居前寸步、到達終點、趙差程金冠一肩、韓景林竟列第三、顧再平與韓亦差甚微、宿笑如以足未復愈殿軍、程之成績十一秒、尙佳、趙十一秒一、</p>
<p>（二百公尺）二百公尺劉長春登塲獻身手、蓋其拿手戲也、亦祇四人參加、程金冠王季淮未出席、發脚後之四十公尺、劉已佔先、於是一路領先到底、趙秉衡韓景林競爭甚烈、終點、劉超出韓達五米、韓則勝趙一肩、雪百公尺之辱、劉成績二二秒七、未出色、</p>
<p>（四百公尺）參加者僅四人、成績雖未破全國、競爭上較爲粗彩、董叔昭放棄八百公尺、致全力於此項、果然以五十三秒九壓倒曾榮忠、成績尙佳、董一路領前、過三百米、曾在後緊趕、至終點仍以六米之遙、落於董後、曾之成績爲五十四秒八、爲其本來面目，李延祥五五秒五第三、</p>
<p>（八百公尺）參加者四人，董叔昭旣放棄、羅慶隆遂無敵手、一路居前、賈連仁與李延祥有劇鬥、六百米處、賈一躍在李之前、再過五十米、李居賈前、再過五十米、李又落賈後、從此賈以次席到底、羅有賈前六米、李在賈後三米、羅之二分六秒七、成績平平而已、　　（千五百公尺）又爲四人之競爭、鄭森開始卽居領袖地位、其次爲侯德崇董家爕印宗臣等、第一圈四百公尺、八百公尺時、鄭尙居首、侯次之、印宗臣已躍於董之前、惟魚貫於進、相差極微、千二百公尺、印宗臣又見超出於侯德崇之前、最爲之三百公尺、見印如飛奔上、竟將鄭森壓倒、以六米居前獲第一、四分六秒七之成績、殊爲失望、</p>

<p>一萬公尺競爭、最受人注目、山西同光頭長跑大將、出塲受人歡迎、最近在津造成三四分一秒新紀錄之孫澈、及全運會發生糾紛之谷得勝王正林金仲康俱在内、尙有一包車夫參加、惟中途退出、實際六人耳、谷得勝又於八千公尺時退出、故到終點者僅五人、結果孫澈果然以三十四分四十九秒之成績、破全國紀錄、而壓倒羣雄</p>

<p>（王正林大進步）王正林之居第三、亦以三十五分十秒八之成績、打破全國紀錄、其進步可嘉、一路緊追於李登桂之後、在八千公尺處、突然振作、越李而過、於是居李之前、但最後之一千公尺、李又居王前、然最後則王仍以十米之距離、壓倒李登桂居第三、爹仲康雖落後四百米、仍跑畢全程、</p>

<p>（鉛球新紀錄）陳寳球穩取寳座、事前已有評定、但其平時成績、曾超出十三公尺者、故昨日滿望其如願以償、但一試再試、均不得手、幸於第四次一舉越十二公尺之標點、丈量後已達十二公尺六五五之全國新紀錄、並已勝過白　運動會時之十二公尺五五多矣、尙稱美滿、劉仁秀初試卽得十二公尺三三五、往後毫無長進、亦一新紀錄也、大胖子劉福潤第三、十二公尺零五、楊永燦第四、不及十二公尺之標點、程必春之成績、尙不及十公尺、竟人加入預選、未免太不量力矣、</p>
<p>（鐵餅新紀錄）冷培根在白虹運動會中曾有三七·六四之大收穫、昨日因有張齡佳、劉靜仁之竸爭、自當格外小心、兩試未能滿意、第三次擲、如願以償、竸達三七·八五公尺、超出劉仁秀第三次所得三六·五十公尺这等全國紀錄之標記、且係逆風、張齡佳第三、三六·零二公尺、第四程必春、三二·四零公尺、平平而已、</p>
<p>（標槍甚滿意）彭永馨之標槍、久已蜚聲國内、自去年全運會以四八·九二公尺、造全國新紀錄後、刻在華北預選中、又以五十公尺上五破其上項之紀錄、昨雖居逆風、仍能維持其固有功夫、得四九·二三公尺、良非易易第二唐賢輈四六·十二公尺、亦覺不弱、第三潘承斌四四·七一、較其在本校運動會之五項中所得四八·二四、减色遠甚、可見其猶無把握也、郝春德四三·八零得第四、</p>

<p>（跳遠退步多）未跳之前、先量六·九一之標記、使各員努力競爭、各人均鬰鬰不得志、退步良多、王季淮於第三跳得六·四八五、竟完畢覇業、郝春德於第三次跳得六·三十、陸亞雄於最後一躍、以六·四三超出郝而居第二、第四爲張嘉夔六·二零五、</p>
<p>（撑竿不景氣）僅符保盧王禾及黃毅三人參加、符之第一、固無問題、然不料其成績退步如許之多也、黃毅在三·二六時落伍、王禾在三·三三時落選、符保盧又跳過三·五一、加至三·六六、連跳四次、均不得勢、</p>

<h3 id="c208">評兩個戀愛觀碧雲 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 碧雲</p>
<p>談到「戀愛」，馬上就會使人感到甜密密地，彷彿這裏面有無窮的香艷似的。但是，這香艷，這甜密，是不是超脫一切的呢？又是不是人生的第一義呢？於是我們的詩人和藝術家，一切戀愛的至上主義者便會要笑迷迷地回答道；是的啊；除了戀愛以外，更没有人生，變愛是至上的，是神至的。</p>
<p>然而，不幸得很，整天沈醉於愛海中，只憑接吻，不喫别的東西，是不能抵禦肚子的饑餓的；没有飯喫，没有房子住，乃至没有衣穿，愛神「維那絲」是不會光臨的。這樣，所謂「神怪的戀愛」，便就不能超脫人類所賴以生存的物質了。就是說「戀愛是純精神」的人；也不能餓着肚子去靠愛情來生活！</p>
<p>不僅如此，戀愛還要受時間和空間的限制。在封建社會中，女子們爲「三從四德」所束縛，根本就談不到什麽戀愛，只不過是男子們，不，更正確點說，只不過是社會的奴隸吧了。卽或有少數婦女在這時能賞賞「愛的滋味」，也非其自身追求的結果，而是在「父母之命，媒妁之言」下，憑着不可捉摸的幸運碰上的。及至近代的所謂「文明社會」，情形就不同了。男女都可以自由地選擇自己的情侶，在表面上似乎並未受到什麽限制。於是什麽「自由變愛」，什麽「戀愛神怪」等等論調，也就也成了這時代的一時風尙，不過，在事實上，這時的戀愛雖然没有禮敎的束縛，但却爲金錢所規定。「有錢可以買到鬼推磨」，這時的「愛情」也是可以用金錢買來的。君不見四五十歲的富家翁和十七八歲的學校皇后講「自由戀愛」嗎？又不見成千成萬的少女每夜都在出賣自己的肉體與靈魂給許多素不相識的人嗎？這便是所謂神怪的戀愛要受金錢的支配的事實表現。如果在封建社會中婦女是奴隸，那麽在近代的所謂文明社會中的婦女乃至大多數的男人是可以買賣的商品。，所謂「自由戀愛」，所謂「戀愛神怪」在這裏，簡直是自欺欺人的鬼話！</p>
<p>戀愛旣是要受人類生活的限制，旣是要受時空的制約，那人生的第一義更不是戀愛，而是生活的鬥爭。不能生活，便没有一切，因而也就談不到戀愛了；受着生活壓迫的人，必然是痛苦叢生，所謂「愛的享樂」，也就談不到了。所以在現社會下的人生意義，實是在爭取生活的解放和進步。在這大多數的人都受着生活殘酷壓迫的時候，這意義尤其重要。</p>
<p>但是，這裏又來了一個奇怪的意見，而且這意見是從許多新的靑年男女那兒來的；這便是完全否認人類的感情作用的「純性慾主義。」</p>
<p>有些新式的靑年男女，他們在反對戀愛至上主義之下，便以爲兩性的關係，無所謂愛情，只是「性慾」而已。於是今天在這裏發洩性慾，明天又到那裏去竊偷玉香，這簡直是失掉智乃至感情的粗淺的唯物讑的簡單主義者，他們根本就不懂得什麽呌「戀愛」。</p>
<p>自然，愛情不能離開性的關係而獨立存在，但我們却不能因此就將牠完全否定。妓女們不住的在發洩她們的怕慾，但她們常常在苦痛的大海中，並没有什麽愛情；一對感情不好的夫婦，雖然有時發生性的關係，但因他們之間没有很濃厚的感情的原故，而發生離異的事實，是非常之普遍的。這些事實，便把那些完全否定愛情的性慾主義者的見解打得粉粹！</p>
<p>如果戀愛的至上主義者，是以愛情爲人生第一義的，那麽，極端的性慾主義者，在其拚命的追求性的滿足的過程中，亦將要抛棄人生的眞正意義，而專去爲滿足性的生活而生活。兩者都是在現社會中，覺得一切皆無意義，前途渺茫的人所特有的。在這裏，對戀愛問題的極左（單純性慾主義）和極右（戀愛至上主義）的意見殊途同歸了。</p>
<p>一般高唱戀愛至上主義的詩人和藝術家，固然可笑，那些主張單純性慾主義的新的靑年男女們，更是證明他們的幼稚與無知。他們自以他們是在徹底反對小布爾喬亞的没落頽廢的戀愛觀，殊不知自己也於不知不覺中走上没落頽廢的道路了。。</p>
<p>自然，我們並不是禁慾主義者，要反對靑年男女們去講戀愛，不是，一點也不是，我們以爲；</p>
<p>第一，戀愛不是什麽至上的，而是要受人類的生活，時代，社會的限制的；</p>
<p>第二，戀愛也不是至下的，純粹發洩性慾的東西，我們没有曾法完全否定在戀愛中的</p>
<p>感情作用；</p>
<p>第三，戀愛不僅是性與感情的結合，而且是生活的結合，我們的戀愛必須建築在互相了解，互相勉勵，思想和行動一致的基礎上面而且在生活上要時時刻刻不忘努力改進人類的生活，促使社會進化的工作；</p>
<p>最後，我們不要把戀愛當神聖，爲戀愛而生活；也不要把戀愛當兒戲來任意玩弄，這都是没落頽廢的表現，都是阻碍人類的進步的。</p>
<h3 id="c209">姙娠時衛生法 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 醫師沈健安</p>
<p>姙娠是一種生理的現象，不是疾病，不過姙娠時，母體攝取的營養品，一面還得補給胎兒，所以身體各部，抵抗力很薄弱，一面受必然的生理的徵候，如頭痛。無力，食慾减退等等，使身體非常衰弱，那時如受偶發疲病的影響，則就對於母子二體的健康與生命，有莫大的關係，所以十月懷胎之苦，亦就成爲母子相依如命的連繫！尤其在一般醫學常識不普及的中國社會，姙娠與分娩三事好像徘徊在生死歧途上一樣，因此一般稍具智識而不徹底的婦女就厭忌姙娠，甚至壓忌結婚的很多，這是於社會，民族都不可樂觀的現象，可是姙娠究竟危險嗎？苦痛嗎？决不是，這是生理自然的現象，只要我們於姙娠時，稍加注意，就是如得衛生之道，那末姙娠是一點亦没有危險，一點不會有苦痛，所以姙娠時衛生方法是國民誰都應該心得的，如造成健全，幸福的母體與未來的小國民！現將最簡單緊要的幾點，逐一說明一下，請婦女界參考吧！</p>
<p>運動</p>
<p>劇烈的運動是絶對應該禁止，普通應當和求身體的安靜，但是也不可以終日臥床，最好能行適宜的柔軟體操，常常吸入新鮮空氣，屋外散步，多受日光的照射，使精神爽快，少做平常用力的家務事情，長途的旅行，登山，上樓，跳舞，騎馬，騎脚踏車，携帶或挑負重量物件等須絶對禁止，就是長時間的靜坐，打牌，跪拜，洗濯等等，都使母體有害而無益的，　　飲食物</p>
<p>雖然不一定要完全打破素來的習慣，不過最好能够適當的攝取滋養豐富消化容易的東西，凡脂肪過多的食物，和腸内易發生氣體的東西及有刺戟性的食品（如辣椒，胡椒，茄莉，燒酒，烟類等等），都不可濫食，但少量的葡萄酒，淡茶或珈琲，對於母體和胎兒都能够增進益處。</p>
<p>衣服</p>
<p>衣服宜淸潔寛爽，胸部下腹部不宜緊束，氣候冷熱須保持適當的體温，勿使太熱或過冷，在腹部須紥腹帶，目的在保持胎兒的體温，使胎兒的位置固定，將腹部纒絡後，腹部不會向下方下墜，而且胎兒形不過大，容易分娩，我國向來以爲腹帶有害無益，這話是不對的，又有一般婦人一向將胸部和腰部有緊縛的習慣，因此腹部受壓逼，血液循環受障碍，因此面部浮腫，下肢靜脈等發生，胎兒的健康與發育受　碍，此等在姙娠中均須特别注意。</p>
<p>通便</p>
<p>孕婦最易發生便秘，腸内有害氣　　　後，能引起各種全身症狀，如惡心，嘔吐，痔瘡，腸胃病等，預防便秘須每日行　當的柔耿體操，飯後食水果或早晨空腹時飲冷開水一杯或冷牛乳一杯，必須在一定時間使她大便，成功自然的習慣性。若二日無大便時須請醫生用肥皂水灌腸或甘油灌腸或内服（ＭａｇＳｕｌｆｉ５０）瀉鹽十五瓦、但藥房販賣的一般劇性下劑，往往誘起早產或流產的弊害，所以須絶對的禁服（以有在姙娠時間中患疾病的，决不可服金鷄納霜丸因金鷄納霜丸對於孕婦有流產的可能。</p>
<p>利尿</p>
<p>姙娠初期的時候，决不能將尿常常　溜在膀胱内，有小便的時候就應當排泄，否則會發生子宮後傾或後屈，有時候更會發生蛋白尿和糖尿症，最好常常請醫生檢查，有否蛋白或糖的存在，可以預防生糖尿病或腎臟炎。</p>
<p>精神狀態</p>
<p>母體的精神狀態會影響到胎兒，這呌做胎敎孕婦精神受惡劣的感動之後、發生健康障碍，害利的竟然可以發生流產，所以孕婦應當常常安靜修養，並且不宜對孕婦常談難產，流產，初產種種困難的新聞，或者畸形異胎的怪聞，使姙婦受恐佈驚慌，影響到胎兒，孕婦不宜看富有强剌戟的小說，圖畫，戲劇，電影等，或過度的喜怒哀樂，神精不宜過勞，睡眠須充分，得要安全的生活才行，</p>
<p>身體的淸潔</p>
<p>受孕以後，往往外陰部分泌過多，惹起外陰部炎或傳染其他的疾病，所以必須每日用微温湯洗滌，二日必須沐浴一次，但過熱或長時間的先浴，會發生姙娠中絶，洗滌時，水不可以洗到陰道裏面，除非陰道病變時，纔可以陰道洗滌！這陰道洗滌有專門的器械，所以非請敎醫生不可。</p>
<p>乳房</p>
<p>乳房部須解放。不宜緊縳，在姙娠的最後的一個月，　　　　用淸水或酒精凈洗，使乳頭部的皮　　全　　抗力增大，有預防乳頭裂傷或傳染的能力，乳嘴發育不良或陷入時，每日將乳嘴提舉數次，使乳頭漸漸突出，分娩後小兒哺乳時不感困苦及乳嘴痛等。</p>
<p>性交</p>
<p>若的確知道姙娠以後，性交必須有限制，不然往往容發生傳染，普通姙娠到四月後，性交須絶對的嚴禁！</p>

<p>— 華</p>
<p>二顧瑪麗</p>
<p>顧瑪麗（ＭａｒｉｌＧｕｉｓｅ），我們上次在講康多塞的一文中業已提及過她，她是法國大革命時期女性當中頭一個參加政治活動和組織婦女平權運動的人物。她生於法國南部之蒙托坂，一說是在一七五三年，一說是在一七五五年。她的母親，不是做女服裁縫，便是拾破布的一個窮婦，父親的底細，不不明瞭。</p>
<p>顧瑪麗是個講演家，當時凡婦女團體開會，民衆集會，及各種政黨的俱樂部裏，她常常出席講演，並且在革命後的法國國民大會上，她也出席講演過。其時，國民大會在討論議事日程上所列的問題前，曾允許女界提出議案，發表意見。顧瑪麗的熱烈的美辭，爭辯的奇智，温雅的意思，屢屢打動了國民代表。她借用刋行小册子，寫論文，發表宣言等手段，終改變了現狀。</p>
<p>顧瑪麗的活動，主要的可說是她對婦女本身地位之改良，十二分關懷。她認爲萬惡的根源，是在男性控制了女性；婦女要達到人類發達的最高階段，她以爲惟一的出路。只有自由，婦女平權。要獲得自由和婦女平權，只有用被壓迫者的團結力量，方能夠做到。用賢明而正大的要求以鼓勵和團結婦女，領導她們去爲婦女眞正平權而奮鬥，這就是顧瑪麗竭盡才智刻苦奮鬥的基本目的。　　她在一張小小的「女權」傳單上說道；</p>
<p>「男子們！誰給了你們以壓近婦女的權利？請你們瞧一瞧整個兒自自然界；它的裏面是否有點兒像你們那樣的任意和橫暴？你們試瞧一下活的物質，問一下猛獸，研究一下植物，調查，探求，並分析一下自然界裏一切兩性間的相互關係，牠們到處都是相親相愛，到處都是永久的巧妙的天生萬物之恊和一體，你們剛消滅了貴族的特權，請你們也廢止了男性的特權吧！人們正在開始享有自己的權利，黑奴也在解放着。爲什麽不把婦女解放呢？」</p>
<p>顧瑪麗曾竭力敎她自己的姊妹學習解放的事業，她給她們說道；</p>
<p>「革命時期還没有臨近我們婦女麽？難道我們應當萬世萬世的孤獨的生活着，從不積極地人同從事社會建設的事業嗎？」</p>
<p>法國大革命時著名的「人權宣言」，只是單方面的解釋男性的權利，並未有隻字提及女性。顧瑪麗爲答復它起見，特發表了一件差不多同樣著名的宣言；「女權宣言」。她明瞭地，透澈地，動人心靈地提出了婦女在社會上和在政治上完全平等的要求。茲將該宣言全文，迻譯於左；</p>
<p>「女性天賦自由，權利與男性相等，每個優良的社會，其目的都是在保護任何法令所不能剝奪的兩性的權利；自由，進步，安全，對壓抑之制裁。····但事實上天賦與女性的權利，迄今所承認者，僅在狹隘的範圍以内而已。國家所賴以建立的國民，是由男女社會搆成，法制應當是這個社會的意志之表現。一切女性公民，正如一切男性公民應當，個人或經過她們所舉的代表，而參與自治。自治對於一切人們，均應同等。因此，一切男女兩性公民。依其能力，均須允許其擔任一切的社會位置，權能，職務；惟有他們的德性與才能之差别，始可作爲選舉之標凖。婦女有登展覽臺之權，有登講演臺之權；她們務須要享有這兩種權利。然婦女的權利，應當服務於共公的幸福，不應服務於性的利益。</p>
<p>女性亦如男性，應當分擔國幣；同樣，女性連男性一樣，有要求國帑管理公開之權。苟國家基本大法？非搆成國民的大多數人們所製定時，定必無效。婦女們，請試試吧···眞理的炬火，業已照散了愚鈍和暴政的黑雲；什麽時候你們將恢復視力呢？團結起來，以理智和正義的力量來對抗粗暴的體力吧！你們將很快地看到，男性將再不苦惱地追求你們了，他們將驕傲地抬高頭顱，挺起胸脯，和你們平分萬世的人類權利，而與你們携手並進了。」</p>
<p>總而言之，顧瑪麗，她在傳單上，在小册子中，在講演的時候，在政黨俱樂部和學術團體裏，處處興奮爭辯的，都是關於婦女權利的問題。她曾創辦了歷史上頭一個提倡婦女運動的雜誌。當時，法國的國民大會所接到贊成和反對婦女平等的請願書，不可以數計。顧顧瑪麗認爲成立政治團體以團結婦女的時機到了，她於是創立了她多婦女政治恊會，而作爲她們的領導者和宣傳者。</p>
<p>不過，顧瑪麗，雖然她的言辭巧妙動人，但她對婦女問題的言論，仍是散漫雜亂的。她把現存的社會關係（此由於經濟上的必要而形成的）之責任，完全歸罪於男性，以爲這是由於男性近視，太自私自利所致，而忽略了社會經濟的背景，這是應當注意的。</p>

<p>這已是三年前的事了，我們到了英，法，德，比，瑞諸國因時間和節省，經濟的關係，總不大住旅館，那便是租屋和住棒形，Ｐｅｎｓｉｏｎ這是一種供膳宿的公寓式的人家。和她們的家庭接近的機會多，所以她們的一切，比較淸楚些。</p>
<p>家庭婦女；中國的生活程度，年來雖在加長；但和歐洲各國比較起來，還是大相懸殊！因爲中國的人二賤，普通家庭，用三兩個僕人，是很平常的一回事。譬如在法國雇一個女傭，每小時需五佛郎；德國則在一馬克左右。（約合國幣一元）這種女工，幾乎是一種專門職業，她們學校上課式的，按照鐘點，每天可以出入許多人家。所以，做主婦的，一天到晚，忙得不亦樂乎！丈夫一早出外辦公；她們趕快打發大的孩子進學校；給小的孩子吃牛奶；揩拭家具，打掃地板窗户；然後推着孩子睡車，到菜市選購一天的菜蔬。回家脫下外衣，穿上圍裙，很仔細而又忙迫的烹調食物。她們捨不得浪費五個生丁。（銅板）更捨不得花五個佛郎，請一位女工來代勞一小時。尤其是禮拜六，那是她們大掃除的日子，她們應當洗刷一切用具。那一天，我們可以看見，老的少的婦女們，用自來水管在大門和階梯上冲洗，並用粗毛刷發很的刷。只有禮拜日，是她們頂安閒而又快樂的日子，一家子穿了整齊的服裝；到郊外或公園去飽吸新鮮空氣；或參觀博物院和美術館；自然，電影院，跳舞塲，咖啡館，也有他們的足跡；這樣便消逝了他們六日來的疲勞！</p>
<p>社會婦女；歐洲婦女，在外工作的，非常之多，大公司，商店，小學校，女職員幾佔十之八九。女孩兒到了十七八歲，便須在外謀生自立？可是；她們的薪金很微，月入不過二三百佛郎，多至五百佛郎。她們，簡吃省用，慢慢的儲蓄起來，因爲；她們還未結婚啊！對手選擇了，他便要先問她，有多少奩資？因爲兩人組織家庭，所需要的一切，如；桌，椅，床，褥，和廚房用具，都歸她辦理；至以後的生活，則由他擔負。如其面貎醜陋的女人，便很難找到配偶了！或者，所適非人，一旦結了婚，把數年來的辛苦積蓄，給他騙去，而遺棄不顧，就更可憐了！加以歐戰后，男丁死亡殘廢無算，社會上男少女多，所以她們中，有許多寧願孤獨一生的。有了以上的種種困難，因之年來歐洲婦女，多數嫁給了東方有色人種，尤其是咱們中國，在外的留學生，大都是有產階級的少爺們，學成（？）歸國，機機挺她的做什麽委員，什麽長或者當大學敎授，她們不是馬上享褔做闊太太了嗎？誰願意再執洒掃烹飪之役呢！當然，也有不改本來勤儉常態的，那就看個人的環境了！</p>

<p>兩月前，日本報紙，大載非洲愛基握比亞皇子，因戀慕日本女性，在日選妃，一時應選者大有其人，結果黑田子爵之女雅子當選，一時全國傳爲美談，忙煞新聞記者與雜誌編輯。　　最近雅子正日夜忙着籌備結婚，忽有愛基握比亞駐意大利公使，謂黑黃的國際聯烟，因某國極力干涉，行將解除婚約。</p>
<p>消息傳來，自然使念念不忘海外發展的島國人民，大爲抱憾，雅子小姐，當然更加難堪。當她初接此消息時，據說非常興奮，而不甚置信，最後她才狠鎭定地說；「卽使眞的解約，我也不致因此而頽喪，至少我這次的舉動，已使日本女性認識了日本女性之該向海外活躍，······我個人的事小，而日本之如此受國際壓迫，則實有一顧之必要。同時我爲什麽要下嫁作黑人婦的苦心，當亦爲一般所了解，所以我狠可以自慰。···」，斯言很足代表日本婦女的心理。</p>

<p>— 曼倫</p>
<p>一天下午，和朋友到一個大公司去購買皮鞋，在那裏恰好遇着一個天眞活潑的年靑女店員，她十分和靄而謙恭地，把皮鞋一雙一雙的拿給我們試穿，我的朋友便和她慢慢的談起來了。她告訴我們，她是揚州的一個初中畢業生；因爲家中姊妹多，父親又遭失業，所以經濟異常困難；她聽到上海大公司招考女店員，便毅然來投考，僥倖考取了，現在每月薪水三十元，和一個同伴同住一間亭子間，每人房金三元，飯金七元，餘下的二十元，還須寄十五元給父母，所剩下來的零用只有五元了，還得製些衣服等等。她說着，我們反把買皮鞋的事情擱起來了。她繼續着又說下去，生晨八點鐘就得到公司，一直到下午八點多鐘才得出來。····自從到這裏來了幾個月，每天只在派定的部份工作；公司雖是有這樣大，然而在我却覺得很像一個牢獄，終日的工夫，得消費在這裏丨丨丨丨。明明知道冷氣逼人的寒冬去了，温暖迎人的春光到臨，可是那可愛的嫩綠嫣紅的花兒草兒，臨風舞蕩的綠楊碧柳，那有我們欣賞的分兒呢？一到停工的時候，已經是燈光閃耀，第一件重要的工作，只有大家回家吃飯的一件了。所以，我們的生活問題雖然解决了，可是靑春就是這樣暗淡的過去了。她又繼續着說；除了這種生活外。還有一種使人氣悶的事，那就是來往的顧客們，女的倒没有什麽爲難的事情，可恨的那些油頭滑腦的男人們，常常用不相干的言語，來和我們兜搭，糾纒不淸，揣測他們的意思，無非是胡調。我們閒下來也喜歡看看報紙，可是報上的有許多消息和小品文字，又常常是刺激我們的神經，我們本是好人家的兒女，做一個店員，這原是男人們也有的，不想那些寫文章的人們，却拿我們做材料，開現笑，前幾天某報上有一幅漫畫，不是滿紙的畫着辱駡女人的東西嗎？我們女店員也在被駡之列呢？在學校裏的時候，聽到先生說；人都應當自食其力，又有許多人主張着，女人應當經濟獨立，經濟獨立，不是出外找事做嗎？做店員並不是不名譽的事情，雖是我們穿的衣服比較新鮮一點，這也是老板的命令，我們吃他的飯，只有服從····。他們（指寫文章的）爲什麽不從前提着想，而只譏諷我們這些呆憐的人呢·······。</p>
<p>她像是忘記了在做店員。我們也忘記了來買皮鞋，女子願是最易動感情的，我們只是十分的同情她。</p>
<p>忽然地鄰桌上一陣铃響，給她一個奇妙的反應。她於是重新拿起一雙皮鞋來。</p>
<p>「小姐請試試這一雙·······」。</p>

<p>— 寳玉</p>
<p>小朋友！你們知道努力的意義麽？努力是盡你的力量，去做你應該做的事。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們聽見過烏龜和兎子賽跑的故事麽？烏龜走得很慢，但是它肯努力、所以牠勝利了，兎子跑得很快，但是牠不肯努力，在半路上睡覺了；結果，牠是失敗了！</p>
<p>你們在學校裏，不是年看見有許多同學，學問很好，有許多學生，學問不好麽？牠的緣故，就是一個肯努力，一個不肯努力。　　世界上有很多的人，都像一隻兎了，最初是很用力的前進着、但是到後來，他不肯努力了。他失敗了！又有很少的人，他能夠不斷的努力着，所以他成功了！</p>
<p>小朋友！你若是肯像烏龜一樣，努力的前進，你的前途，一定很有希望。</p>
<p>小朋友！你不是時時希望你的學問，一天一天的進步麽？你不是羡慕偉大的人麽？我告訴你；你若是要實現你的希望，你祗有努力地前進。</p>

<p>— 人偉</p>
<p>弱肉强食，是天演公例。大魚吃小魚，是必然的事實。這並没有什麽可以異義的地方。</p>
<p>一尾大魚河中追逐一條小魚。小魚說；「你不要太殘忍，我是你的同類！」同類。現在只有二條路可走；第一條是我吃你，第二條是你吃我。」小魚眼看他那在個子的身體，只有歎息道；「那麽，請你把我吃了吧！」</p>
<p>但是，小朋友！請你們不要害怕。大人們决不會吃小孩子的，因爲你們有親愛的父母愛護着，你們有國家的軍隊保護着。不過假使你們一旦脫離了父母的懷胞，或者離開了國境，你們决不會有現在一樣的快樂生活。</p>
<p>小朋友！乘你們現在還没有脫離父母或者遠離祖國之前，你們應當趕快努力讀書，鍜鍊體格；否則將來一旦遇到强者，你不能勝過他，他就要害掉你。</p>
<h3 id="c234">一句諺語 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 有基</p>
<p>小朋友們；我來告訴你們一句諺語，丨一句很有意義的諺語。</p>
<p>那是一句西方的諺語，那諺語說道；「没有東西會跌入一隻睡着的狐狸的嘴裏去的」小朋友們；這是一句很確實的話。你們想，一隻睡着的狐狸，嘴終是閉着的吧。那麽，卽使有東西從上面掉下來，也掉不進它的嘴裏去了。何况上面不一定有東西掉下來呢。退一步說，上面却有東西會掉下來，而那睡着的狐狸的嘴却又是開着，但那東西掉下來的時候，怎麽能一定掉在它的嘴裏呢。所以這名諺說，没有東西會跌入一隻睡着的狐狸的嘴裏的，却是不差的。</p>
<p>但如何以說那是一句有意義的諺語呢？原來那諺語中含着一種敎訓。那敎訓是懶惰的人，决不會得到東西的。你看好睡着的狐狸，不是懶惰的麽？那有它動也不動，東西就會掉在它的嘴裏的呢？</p>
<p>小朋友們；你們不可懶，你們要勤，讀書要勤；情潔要勤；樣樣好的　情都要勤。勤了、學問會進步，身體會健康，得到無窮的快樂。</p>

<p>— 章南邨</p>
<p>敏兒在星期日，他的父親帶他到上海城隍廟游玩，上海城隍廟，賣兒童玩具很多，敏兒聽見先生說過；日本人做兒童玩具，向來銷　甚大。敏兒看見許多賣的玩具，認不得到底是日貨，還是國貨，所以一槪都不要買。後來看見賣雀子店裏，有洋老鼠出賣，那些洋老鼠正在玻璃籠裏爬盤車。敏兒以爲是很好玩的，對他父親說；「買子帶回去玩玩好不好？」父親笑着對他說；「你說不肯買洋貨，這洋老鼠不是洋貨嗎？」敏兒牽着父親的手，拉了就走，口裏說；「我是絶對不買洋貨的，這洋老鼠，不要了，决走吧！」他父親見他這樣愛國，眞是可愛，因說道；「雖然名字呌洋老鼠，實是中國人自己畜養出賣的，並非舶來品，可以買了，前言是說的笑話，不必誤會」。就買兩個洋老鼠，一和架裝鼠的玻璃籠，走回的時候，又買一個中國紙紮的花燈。</p>
<p>到了晚上，敏兒見着洋老鼠爬盤車，手裏又提了點着火的花燈，高興得了不得做了一首洋老鼠兒歌，一首點花燈兒歌，就悠悠揚揚的唱起來。他的兩首兒歌寫在下面。</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>（一）英國人的嚴屋，（二）南美洲鮑利威土人的屋子，用泥和樹枝築成。（三）勒普蘭人的屋子，用草土築成。（四）加麥浪人的泥屋，（五）毛利人（新西蘭的居民）的屋子，柱上畫着人頭等圖畫。（六）北美印第安人的小屋，柱上覆着樹皮，草蓆，或獸皮。（七）安南人的屋子，建立在木椿之上。（八）澳大利亞人的屋子，以樹枝搭成。（九）口本人的紙屋。（十）明多那人的樹屋。（十一）荷沙人的草屋。（十二）愛斯基摩人的雪屋。（十三）俄羅斯農民的木屋。</p>
<p>世界上各種民族所住的屋子，像他們所穿的衣服一樣，也有很大的差别。因爲氣候和建築材料的不同，他們的屋子的形式，也就大大地兩樣了。例如住在北極的愛斯基摩人的屋子，是用雪塊來造的，因爲到了冬天，雪塊是他們最容易得到的建築材料。俄羅斯農民用木頭來造房子，因爲他們住在大森林的附近。常常發生水患的地方，房屋常建立在木椿或樹上，以防免水患。像非洲那樣的熱帶地方，房屋大部份用草或泥築成，因爲在熱帶上，多的是草和泥。但在文化發達的地方，居民的住屋，多數用磚成石來建築，而不大用當地土產的材料，如泥，草之類。文化愈發達，住屋的建築也愈堅固精美，這是世界的通例。</p>

<p>徐炳生侃然的說；「不！因爲菜燒得不好，我飯吃不下了」。</p>
<p>敎師更覺有些奇怪了；「旣然飯吃不下，那末該早些來了」。</p>
<p>「先生！你還不明白嗎？我因爲飯吃不下，所以跑不動路了」。</p>

<p>（一）團結就是力量</p>
<p>從前有一個年老的人，他有五個兒子，他們並不和睦，每天大家只是爭鬥着，他雖然屢次勸他們，可是一些也没用，一天，他想了一個方法，拿了一束筷，呌他們依次去折斷它，但是束得極固的筷，雖然竭了他們的力，結果是没用。隔一會，他解散了筷，一隻隻分給他們去折斷，於是，他們很容易的折斷了，因此，他敎訓他們道；「我的孩子，你們總要握住這團結的力量！假使你們能夥團結起來，没有一個仇敵能够傷害你們，同時，你們爲爭鬥而分散開來，那麽無論那一個仇敵都可以傷害你們了！」</p>
<p>（二）德性會得到相等的報酬的</p>
<p>一隻口渴的螞蟻，到小泉旁去喝水，跑得快些，因此被泉水冲在水裏，一個在飛的鴿子看見了，伊很可憐他，因此含了一片樹葉放在伊的旁邊，伊得救了，爬上了葉，待葉流近泉邊的時候，又悄悄的爬上了岸。隔了不久，這隻鴿子在樹林裏給一個獵者看見了，當他用槍瞄凖伊的時候，螞蟻恰巧在獵者的脚旁，於是他很急的在獵人的脚上剌了一口，獵人受了暗中的打擊，却給那鴿子逃走了。</p>

<p>小朋友，在這風和日暖的當兒，你們還記得放風箏的玩意兒嗎？我想諸位小朋友，一定不會健忘，一定還記得在星期日，或者放假的空時間，來玩這麽一套。</p>
<p>風箏的種類很多；魚呀！鳥呀！老人呀！蜈蚣呀！應有盡有，不一而足，本呌做紙鳶，因爲有人把他安置弓弦；風激弦　，所以也呌做風箏。</p>
<p>小朋友；也曾知道電學發明家，美國富蘭克林先一嗎？原來他在攝風箏的當兒，天大雷雨，他用一個銅鑰匙，掛在風箏綫上，同時看見鑰匙上閃閃的發出光來，於是他感覺金屬有誘導電流的作用，所以成爲電學界的發明家。</p>

<p>小朋友們若是跑到動物園裏去遊玩，回來的時候，必定要發生一種感想，就是；獰猛巨大的獸類，究竟那一種的力是最强大？那一種的性是兇狼的？動物們都各具有自負的力。譬如獅子遇到强力的同類，就現出一副怒容，振作精神，緊張筋肉，露出銳利的牙齒，上下相並，張開兩顎，自負厲害的樣子。獅子本是獸王。它的前肢一抓，牛，鹿，縞馬等。就要倒地而死，「尾巴振動，就是要殺人的表現。」腥腥常常在森林中或河邊，搏擊鰐魚與大蛇，它具有强大的碗力的兩手能把鰐魚的上下兩呎拉扯開來，張開嘴咬碎鰐魚的咽喉，大則雖蛇的身，纒繞它的身它能把蛇央咬斷，河馬在動物中最肥大，身長十五呎，體動四噸，體形像樽桶，口闊而大，土人所垂的划船，常爲其呑噬，就是小的輪船也要被字拖到水底裏去的。象比河馬爲小，非洲的巨象，高達一一·八五呎，印度的象，亦有一○·五呎，古代羅馬，時常利用象的大力爲戰爭的。西龍島的土人，令幾匹象恊力把高三十呎周圍五呎的樹，連拔起來，其鼻把粗大樹枝一捲，就會折斷。非洲的人猿，用兩拳能够打死巨象。至於鳥類中氣力最大的那要算駝鳥了，次爲食火鳥，這類大鳥雖然不能高飛，可是走起來，反比其他有翼的鳥類爲快，它們用長脚銳爪爲武器，我們倘若被它一摑，就難以生存的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">President Wang Returns to Nanjing to Attend the Provisional Meeting of the Central Political Council, Reports on His Trip to Jiangxi, Huang Fu's Resignation Intention May Be Dispelled, Departs Yesterday to Return to His Hometown <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After President Wang met with Chairman Chiang, Huang Fu in Jiangxi to discuss the North China issue and the East Asian situation, he left Nanchang by special train on the morning of the 13th with Chen Shaokuan and Zeng Zhongming. He arrived at Xun in the afternoon at 3:00 PM, then transferred to the Zhongshan warship eastward. It was scheduled to arrive in Nanjing at 7:00 AM on the 14th, but the warship encountered obstacles at Huangshiji, which delayed it for several hours. It finally arrived at Xiaguan at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th. In advance, the Navy Band and military police were lined up on both sides of the pier. Ye Chucang, Zhu Jiahua, Peng Xuepei, Chen Bijun, and Chen Xunyong, heads of the various naval divisions, and dozens of others came to the pier to welcome them. President Wang, Zeng Zhongming, and Chen Shaokuan disembarked, shook hands with the welcoming personnel to express their gratitude, and then entered the city in the same car with Chen Bijun. After dropping Chen off at the official residence of the Ministry of Railways, he went directly to the Central Party Headquarters to attend the provisional meeting of the Central Political Council. Central Committee members Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Gongbo, Wang Shijie, Luo Wengan, Zhu Peide, Huang Musong, Zhao Pilian, and more than thirty others rushed to attend. First, Wang reported on the details of his trip to Jiangxi to consult with Chiang and Huang. Then they briefly discussed other matters. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. After the meeting, Wang told reporters that he only stayed in Jiangxi for a day and a half and had several talks with Chiang and Huang. The scope of discussions was very broad, including the handling of North China affairs and the current situation in recent years, as well as the general world situation and the East Asian situation. However, no concrete decisions were made. In addition, Huang recently felt difficulty in handling affairs and physical and mental fatigue, and he indeed had passive intentions. After Chiang earnestly retained him, I also retained him after arriving in Nanchang, hoping that he would temporarily take a leave of absence to recuperate for a few days. After Huang takes a short rest, he may dispel his intention to resign. Huang is scheduled to depart from Jiangxi on the 15th, pass through Nanjing, and return to his ancestral home in Zhejiang to sweep the tombs. Chiang supervised the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi, and the morale is strong. The bandit areas are shrinking day by day, and they can be gradually cleared soon. (14th Central Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Huang Fu finished reporting his instructions in Jiangxi and is now leaving the province for Shanghai to return to his hometown. (14th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, someone met with Wang and asked about the issues of transportation and postal services. Wang resolutely denied it, saying that before the Fujian Incident, the Japanese side had once requested negotiations, which were suspended due to the Fujian Incident. After the Fujian Incident was quelled, the puppet Manchukuo made the ridiculous move of usurping the throne. Although the Japanese side expressed its intention to reopen the previous discussions, the North China authorities were extremely saddened by Puyi's usurpation, which aroused public outrage. All negotiations are out of the question under these circumstances, so there have been no negotiations to date. He was also asked whether the reports that the central government would send Huang to the Southwest to relay the diplomatic situation in North China were true. Wang replied that there was no such thing. (14th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person said that transportation and postal services should still be resolutely opposed. Although the results of the Nanchang meeting are still unknown, for the sake of the country's future, this kind of unreasonable request from the Japanese side should be resolutely opposed. It must be understood that the issue of transportation and postal services is complicated, and no matter who we negotiate with, there is a suspicion of de facto recognition of the puppet state. (14th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Fu requested resignation due to physical exhaustion. Chiang and Wang retained him and agreed to give him a few days off to return to his hometown to sweep the tombs. It is now learned that Huang has decided to depart from Jiangxi on the morning of the 15th, pass through Nanjing to Shanghai, and then return to his ancestral home. It has not yet been decided whether he will stop in Nanjing when he passes through. (14th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person received a telegram from Huang Fu stating that after finishing his business in Jiangxi, he would go to Nanjing, then to Shanghai, and return to Mogan Mountain. He also plans to return to the north earlier. Yin Tong originally planned to go south to see Huang, so he will not go to Nanjing for the time being. (14th Special Telegram)</p>

In addition to dispatching teams to strictly guard all key points in eastern Sui, determined not to let them flee east, they also supervised the infantry, cavalry, artillery, and the provincial government's armored car team to quickly go to encircle them. The bandits previously followed Sun's army to invade Ning, and they were repeatedly intercepted. This time, they fled back and were heavily attacked by the Jin-Sui army. They have become exhausted and can be wiped out in one fell swoop. The Yang bandits once disturbed Bailing Temple, and the Mongolian people in the temple and various banners felt uneasy. On the 13th, the provincial government sent Counselor Liu Cheng to the temple to explain the bandit suppression military deployment and the maintenance of the temple to the Mongolian people of various banners.

<p>(Nanjing) Li Xitong, County Magistrate of Dian Shun Ning, telegraphed back to the Nanjing Public Diplomacy Support Association, stating that regarding the case of British troops invading Ban Hong, he received a report yesterday from Han Futing, the chieftain of Gengma, stating that many foreign soldiers had been sent from the British-Burmese Gunlong River area, stationed in various places, and building river bridges, and it was not known what their intention was. He immediately sent scouts and inquired about the chiefs in the vicinity. According to Chief Song Zongfu, about 300 British troops had come to the province, 70-80 troops were stationed in Moneng, more than 100 troops were stationed in Guogan, and three foreign officials led troops to garrison at Shan Mountain, intending to attack the Ban Hong silver mine. Please forward the report for handling negotiations to avoid repeating the mistakes of Pianma. According to this, Ban Hong is the British Luning area, which is adjacent to Pianma. During the Qing-British boundary demarcation, it was designated as Chinese territory. However, in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the British built a road from Xiangshu, which had reached the Gunlong River. Now, they are building bridges and roads again, which is clearly an invasion of our Ban Hong. This matter concerns national border defense and is very serious. Please unanimously support and request serious negotiations. (14th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The city's commerce is declining. Although the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee has plans to prosper the market, it is still trying to prepare. There is a rumor that the city's banking community is raising funds to lend to merchants, but it is actually a kind of propaganda. In fact, the banking community has no such plan. Lending to merchants is originally a banking business to relieve the market's finances. Bankers are also very willing to help because the nature of banks is to receive and lend money. It is necessary to have a solid guarantee to lend other people's money to merchants. The city's commerce is not prosperous, and the collateral is reduced accordingly. Moreover, most of the people living in this capital do not bring their families to Beijing, and they do not seem to be planning to stay for a long time. The amount of money remitted and taken to Shanghai every month is always around two million, while the amount consumed in this capital is less, so the market is not easy to prosper.

<h3 id="e21">On the US-Japan Non-Aggression Treaty <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Since President Roosevelt took office in March of last year, dramatic changes have occurred in the politics and economy of the United States. Its foreign policy has also been affected accordingly. The US-Japan relationship is one of the most prominent examples. Since the economic panic in the United States in 1929, domestic industrial equipment has become increasingly dilapidated, and overseas markets have also been sluggish. What has been able to maintain the status quo is entirely due to the subtlety of its diplomatic operations. Even after the September 18th Incident, although the United States repeatedly spoke out for justice, it only stopped at the right point, and it did not want to have more explicit expressions. This is because the United States only focuses on the development of economic interests and the acquisition of sales markets in the Far East. Now the trade relationship between the United States and Japan has reached the first place in the Far East. (Note that US cotton exports to Japan account for half of its national exports. Other items such as machinery, steel, and wood are worth more than 50 million yen per year.) Therefore, the United States will never cut off diplomatic relations with Japan unless it is absolutely necessary and willingly suffer economic losses.</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, although militarists strongly advocate anti-Americanism, their strength to monopolize hegemony in the Pacific is still insufficient. Moreover, raw silk accounts for almost half of Japan's total exports, and the vast majority of raw silk exports go to the United States. Therefore, the conflict between the United States and Japan is definitely not in the interest of Japan's foreign trade. From the perspective of international politics, Japan has tried its best to exert its military aggression policy. Our people certainly have no good feelings about it. Even the Anglo-Japanese relationship is superficial, and the Soviet Union, which dominates the north, is preparing for war to compete with Japan. The conflict and opposition between Japan and the Soviet Union are becoming increasingly acute. If Japan cannot open up a diplomatic outlet in the Pacific, I am afraid that even before the military confrontation, the bloodless economic war alone will be enough to kill it. Therefore, various Japanese propaganda voices for friendship with the United States are singing high into the clouds. First, Hiroshi Saito's lobbying, followed by Fumimaro Konoe's efforts. The negotiation of the so-called US-Japan Non-Aggression Treaty seems to be a step closer to possibility. However, even if the US-Japan Non-Aggression Treaty is concluded, we cannot but doubt whether the peace in the Pacific can be truly maintained. The US-Japan understanding may indeed be sincere in the United States, but Japan has other intentions. Just look at how, after the informal preliminary understanding between the United States and Japan was established, Japan's oppression of the Asian continent has suddenly become more serious. In North China, the number of Japanese troops in Jindong and Malan Pass has suddenly increased to more than 2,000, with many aircraft attached, making the eastern border of Chahar feel very uneasy. Also, in the puppet Manchukuo, the Nagoya Third Division and the Kyoto Sixteenth Division were deployed, carrying a large number of new-style weapons. (Japan still uses the rotation of troops as a cover for this troop deployment. In fact, the combined strength of the Eighth and Tenth Divisions, which were transferred back to the country, is less than two-thirds of the Third and Sixteenth Divisions.) It is preparing to strengthen the international war and covet Inner Mongolia. It can be seen that although the relationship between the United States and Japan is gradually improving, the Asia, then will and</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Because Speaker of the House of Peers Konoe is scheduled to go to the United States in May to promote US-Japan friendship, he went to Saionji to say goodbye and report on the political situation. Therefore, he departed for Okitsu at 1:00 PM today. After visiting Kōenji tomorrow, he will return to Tokyo. Konoe spoke in the car while going west as follows: His eldest son is now at Princeton University. He originally planned to go to the United States when he entered school two years ago, but because there was a temporary parliament, he did not go. Instead, he went on this first trip. This trip to the United States has been rumored to be a goodwill envoy, etc. This kind of goodwill behavior does not seem to be announced in diplomatic strategies. Also, the Hayashi Army Minister issue should not cause a crisis in the political situation, and the Education Minister issue can also proceed smoothly. (14th Den Tsushin Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Illegal negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway were suspended after the Russian side revealed the Japanese side's conspiracy to forcibly seize the Chinese Eastern Railway last year. Foreign Minister Hirota has been making great efforts to mediate it. Recently, the claims of the two sides have gradually approached. To ease the atmosphere of the negotiations, Foreign Minister Hirota held a banquet at his official residence at 12:30 PM today for the representatives of both Russia and the puppet regime. The Russian envoy Yurenev, Counselor Levedev, and Advisor Jarulowski, as well as the puppet envoy Ding Nishiin, puppet Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi, puppet Vice Minister of Transportation Mori, and the Japanese side were accompanied by Vice Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Director of the European and American Bureau Togo, Director of the Information Department Amau, and Chief of the First Western Division. Hirota gave a speech hoping that both sides would make concessions to make the negotiations a satisfactory conclusion. The meeting ended at 1:30 PM. Negotiations did not begin today.

<p>Berlin Germany's political situation is becoming increasingly stable, and the rule of law can be seen to be restored. Interior Minister Dr. Frick announced that Prime Minister Goering's recently promulgated Prussian regulations will be the standard for the entire German nation. The iron-fisted policy can be abandoned from now on. In the future, anyone arrested and detained in a detention center should be given a written announcement of the reasons for their arrest and given the opportunity for the arrested person to defend themselves. Imprisonment in such detention centers should not exceed one week. (13th Guomin Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) The French government is about to convene a French colonial economic conference. It has already appointed a committee to draft the agenda and other details. The conference will discuss foreign competition, with particular attention to Japan's advances in Africa, and proposals to ease quotas on and increase production in the colonies. This was planned two years ago, and the decision to convene it has only now been made. French colonial trade has gradually developed over the past decade. If the natural resources of the entire territory are fully developed, France will need to rely on foreign countries for very few products besides oil. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>(Paris) After today's cabinet meeting, a statement was issued saying that the government can hardly tolerate any demonstrations that may disrupt public order. It also stated that the reduction of veterans' benefits will be calculated from April 1, so the veterans' demand for implementation from June 1 cannot be granted. The government is now dealing with some of the leaders of the strikes. Employees of the central telegraph bureau are striking daily from 12:00 to 1:00 pm to protest pay cuts. The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications is unable to tolerate this and has ordered the work stoppage to end today, and has ordered the publication of the names of the ringleaders, who will be punished.

<h3 id="e29">Gold Standard Countries Waver; Italy Implements Major Austerity Measures; Pay Cuts and Rent Reductions to Save Commerce; Export Trade Hit by Japan <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Rome Today, the cabinet decided on a far-reaching economic plan, hoping to curb Italy's commercial decline. This plan is broad in scope, from pay cuts for civil servants to reductions in rent, presenting a positive austerity trend. Its purpose is to prevent the withdrawal of cash and maintain the country's export trade, in order to resist the benefits gained by the United States, Britain, and Japan due to currency devaluation. This plan is the first austerity step taken by a gold standard country. It is reported that Italy's exports have decreased greatly compared to Japan recently, while Japan's exports have increased greatly in terms of yen, and even in terms of gold, the increase is still considerable. The pay cuts will be progressive, with a 6% reduction for monthly salaries between 500 and 1000 lire, and a 12% reduction for those above 2000. Prime Minister Mussolini will take the largest cut, with the salaries of cabinet members reduced by 20%. Monthly salaries below 500 and the pensions of civil and military personnel will be exempt from cuts. Housing rents will be reduced by 12%, and rents for shops and non-residential buildings will be reduced by 15%. This is the first rent reduction in recent years. The cabinet also decided today that retail food prices should be reduced by 10%. Rumors suggest that wages across the country will also be reduced uniformly. According to official sources, the cost of living in Italy has decreased from 100 to 74 since 1927.</p>

<p>(London) The British steel industry's five-year reorganization plan was released today. This is an unprecedented major industrial reorganization plan in Britain. The British Empire's steel industry will henceforth be completely controlled by the British Steel Corporation. It is reported that this plan has been approved by the Treasury. It is expected that the measure of collecting an import tax of 33 and 1/3 percent on steel will continue after its expiration in October. This plan authorizes the Steel Industry Association to manage imports by quotas for a period of five years, and to levy a tax on domestic consumption to subsidize export trade in order to restore foreign markets. Its purpose is to eliminate unnecessary competition and encourage the merger of factories and the upgrading of machinery, so that all parts of the British Empire's steel industry can cooperate closely.

<p>(New York) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in an interview with a New York Times correspondent stationed in Rome, stated that the French government, regarding the conclusion of a disarmament convention, advocates that the implementation of guarantees for this convention be a condition for concluding the convention. If the guarantees requested by France are reasonable, then Italy is prepared to accept them in principle. Mussolini went on to discuss Italy's pacifism and expressed satisfaction with the improvement of relations between France and Italy, saying that the relaxation of the European situation is the effect of the signing of the Rome Protocols by Italy, Austria, and Hungary. He then stated that the European map created by the Treaty of Versailles must be remade. If it is not remade by means of war, then it must be remade by other, more appropriate methods. What is this more appropriate method? It is a system of political and economic coordination, proceeding gradually. Finally, Mussolini said that the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference involve too wide a scope, and too many meetings are held. The League of Nations can only exist after all nations have formed good neighborly relations. However, if all nations are to form good neighborly relations, it must first be preceded by the expansion of economic regions. Therefore, the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian Rome Accords are the first step in restoring economic prosperity to the Danube River basin, and also a major undertaking for European peace and reconstruction. This undertaking should be based on the Four-Power Pact and continue to advance. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e34">Japan Lacks Sincerity Towards Russia in Multilateral Non-Aggression Pact <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Riga A few days ago, sources in Japan stated that Foreign Minister Hirota was prepared to negotiate a bilateral non-aggression treaty with the United States for a period of ten years or even permanently. However, the United States unofficially indicated that if a mutual non-aggression treaty is to be concluded, it should be jointly concluded by China, the United States, Russia, and Japan, and should not be limited to Japan and the United States. In March of this year, U.S. Secretary of State Hull, in a letter to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, also stated that all countries with interests in the Far East should approach problems currently or in the future arising between two or more countries in a spirit of peace and sincerity, which implicitly contains this meaning. Soviet Russian sources believe that Japan's suggestion to the United States to conclude a non-aggression treaty is intended to prevent the United States from interfering in Far Eastern affairs, so that Japan can act freely towards Soviet Russia. The Russian correspondent stationed in Tokyo, in order to ease public sentiment, stated that Japan is not only willing to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the United States, but also with China and Soviet Russia. However, people here still do not believe this news, because when Japanese Ambassador to France Yoshizawa was transferred to the position of Foreign Minister and passed through Moscow on his way home, the Soviet authorities did suggest to him that a Japanese-Russian mutual non-aggression treaty be concluded, but Japan has so far refused this suggestion.

<p>(Tokyo) The main outlines of the Japan-India Commercial Treaty were roughly determined by representatives of Japan and India in New Delhi on January 5 of this year. Since then, the treaty has been drafted. Recently, the British government suddenly insisted on inserting the preferential tariff established between Britain and India in the previous year into the new treaty. The Japanese government also insisted on the preferential tariff for Japan and its neighboring countries such as "Manchukuo," and instructed Representative Sawada stationed in India to negotiate. On the 13th, Sawada telegraphed a report that the British government had recognized Japan's claim, so the Japan-India treaty issue is expected to proceed smoothly. (Japan United Press, 14th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt signed the Johnson proposal this morning, prohibiting further loans to countries that owe debts, and stipulating that the central government can supervise the raising of debts in the United States by foreign countries. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) European countries that have suspended war debt payments to the United States or are only making credit payments will no longer be able to conduct any financial transactions with the United States or sell public bonds. After returning from his cruise, President Roosevelt's first action was to sign the Johnson Act, which effectively imposes a financial boycott on all war debt countries except Finland, because Finland is able to pay each installment of principal and interest on time. The countries subject to the American currency market boycott include Britain, France, Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Several New York bankers are currently willing to purchase European public bonds and recently requested to promote the sale of new French public bonds, but this was ultimately prohibited by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, on the grounds that the government and Congress have made their attitude towards this move clear in the Johnson Act. Lawyers are currently studying all aspects of the situation related to Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia has not repaid the debts of the Russian Empire and Kerensky. The activities of the Export-Import Bank have been completely suspended pending resolution of legal issues. (Note: The Export-Import Bank is a branch of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, whose initial intention was to provide financial assistance to American trade with Russia.) It is reported that the proposer of the Johnson Act is Republican Senator Johnson. The bill was initially a reference to a type of wording applied to debtor nations in order to control a majority of countries in Central and South America and Europe. Later, it was revised at the request of the executive authorities. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt returned to Washington today. Two hundred Democratic congressmen lined up at the station to welcome him, led by a naval band. This phenomenon is rarely seen in Washington except when a new president takes office. After shaking hands and thanking each congressman, President Roosevelt gave a brief speech to the crowd, saying, "The journalists accompanying the train have repeatedly asked me to make a statement, expressing their hope for an early adjournment of Congress, but I have not said anything, because I hope you will delay the adjournment, as you wish. I hope that you young people will use my many years of experience to tell me about the advantages of the Washington climate in July and August, where the temperature rarely exceeds 110 degrees and there is absolutely no humidity."

<h3 id="e39">Cracks Within Silver Faction <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Cracks caused by the silver issue nearly caused a split among the House leaders today. One faction, led by Lanham, is now working hard to pass several silver regulations before Congress adjourns, while the other faction, led by Congressman Peyser, has received hints from President Roosevelt to adjourn early and has adopted a simple legislative plan to end Congress in mid-May, but without addressing silver. In the House, Lanham is in a position to lead a possible silver rebellion. Lanham published a strong statement in the newspaper today, saying that the opinion of Congress is now working hard to support the passage of the silver bill and will make it happen during this session of Congress. Lanham continued to say that the opinion of Congress is also the opinion of the entire United States. Lanham also attacked the pro-gold faction, accusing them of conspiring to prevent the adoption of silver as currency. Lanham demanded that if the Treasury continues to investigate silver, it should also investigate the activities of the gold faction, and said, "I very much hope that the silver factions in Congress can work together on a single bill," which clearly refers to the mixed silver bill currently being discussed in the Senate. Congressman Fish has obtained 101 signatures on his informal petition seeking timely action by Congress on Fish's silver purchase bill. It is said that the bill may be hindered by the opposition party during this session of Congress, and the opposition party is obstructing the appendix to the bill. The House Banking and Currency Committee has already reported in favor of it. According to observers, if the government is not satisfied with the McCarran Act, then the bill will also have no hope of passing, and the Frazier-Lemke Act, which stipulates the redemption of land deeds at a low price, will also suffer the same result. It is still questionable whether the government's investigation into the trading and storage of silver in New York is part of the government's silver plan, but this secret has aroused a rumor that the government may provide assistance to silver in the future.

<p>(Washington) A bill was introduced in the House today stipulating that the manufacture of arms should be changed from private companies to state-owned enterprises. The proponent was Congressman Sirovich, the same person who attacked Japan's secret military plan last Wednesday. Sirovich solemnly stated when proposing the bill that the President has requested property rights to prohibit the shipment of arms to countries that endanger world peace. Regarding this, Sirovich also traced back to the Senate's adoption of the Nye-Vandenberg joint resolution, according to which a special seven-member committee will be established to investigate American arms manufacturing. In his speech, Sirovich said that if this issue is not observed from other perspectives, the easiest feeling is that arms manufacturing should be a state-owned enterprise, because private companies are ultimately influenced by profit. Sirovich further stated that the manufacture of arms should be managed by the government. A reaction occurred in the audience during the speech, saying, "What is the difference between finished arms and unfinished arms? What is the difference between bullets and metal products?"

<p>(Washington) The labor problem is now expanding daily, dealing a major fatal blow to the development of national industry. In Lidotte City, there are currently 5,000 machine model workers who went on strike today. Rumors that the workers are demanding reduced working hours and increased wages have been denied by the workers. Smaller strikes in the city are also underway. The Machine Education Association of Lidotte City has scheduled a meeting on Monday to discuss countermeasures against the general strike of machine workers. The situation of the miners in Pennsylvania is very worrying, as the atmosphere of strikes has become increasingly strong. However, the steel industry is still relatively stable, but workers are demanding pay increases. The oil workers have rejected the terms of the conciliation association, which advocates paying different levels of wages in different regions as a solution. Fleming, president of the International Oil Workers Union, declared today that if this plan of unequal wages is adopted, it will cause 100,000 oil workers to carry out a general strike.

<p>(London) Regarding the rumor that Soviet Russia has proposed special conditions for joining the League of Nations, Reuters has learned today that the issue has not yet reached the stage of discussing practical conditions. However, what can be clearly decided now is that Soviet Russia will not be willing to consider suggestions that place it in a secondary position. Soviet Russia now feels that if Britain and France can indicate that Geneva indeed welcomes Soviet Russia, then the minor difficulties of small countries such as Switzerland that do not recognize Soviet Russia can be resolved. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the rumor of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations has been prevalent in Paris for a while, according to the Daily Mail, the treaty proposed by Soviet Russia for joining the League of Nations is not easy for Britain and other countries to accept, so this matter is still difficult to achieve in the short term. The report also stated that the conditions proposed by Soviet Russia are as follows: (1) All member states of the League of Nations must recognize Soviet Russia; (2) There must be a formal invitation to join the League of Nations; (3) Must be elected as a permanent member of the League of Nations Executive Council.

<p>(London) The United Federation of Associations Supporting the League of Nations held two meetings yesterday. Soviet Russian Ambassador Maisky was present at both meetings. People in the League of Nations believe that this move is of considerable significance. It is said that opinions have recently been exchanged in Geneva on the issue of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations, and now the Soviet Russian Ambassador has also participated in the United Federation of Associations Supporting the League of Nations. The two events mutually confirm each other, which is quite thought-provoking. Maisky's attendance yesterday shows that Soviet Russia has expressed sympathy for the actions of the Union for the League of Nations in a semi-official form, so his attendance was well-received by the general public. According to some people, if Britain and France express their welcome to Moscow for Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations, then the small countries of the Little Entente, even though they have not yet restored diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, will not be an obstacle to Soviet Russia's accession to the League. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The United Federation of Associations Supporting the League of Nations continued to meet. Lord Lytton proposed a motion, which was unanimously passed. The motion stated that the international establishment of an agreement to reduce disarmament is essential for maintaining peace and reviving the economy. Lytton also firmly stated that he believes that a universal system of security guarantees is better than a partial system of security guarantees. Postmaster General Wood represented Prime Minister MacDonald and read a letter from the Prime Minister, which said, "The British government recognizes the League of Nations as the foundation of British policy. The British government will continue to encourage and assist cooperation among nations, regardless of its form." Wood also said that telephone communication between Britain and Japan will be possible within this year. (Havas, 13th)</p>

Because four warships of the Third Fleet were intercepting them there, they dared not go there and fled northwest again. At 4 pm, they arrived at Changcheng, 25 li north of Zhucheng, and at 7:30 pm, they arrived at Gu County in Gaomi County, 50 li north of Zhucheng, where they were intercepted by Zhang Buyun's troops of the Gaomi County Joint Village Association.

<p>(Xuzhou) Xu Kangliang, the leader of the Central Air Force detachment, along with detachment members Jia Chao, Zhou Xiuzhong, and Zhao Jianzhen, each flew bomber aircraft, carrying bombs and machine guns. At 8:30 am on the 14th, they flew from Xu to Lu. Xu and Jia's planes flew around Taohuashan and Ma'ershan, searching for bandit traces without success. They only saw the Lu army pursuing northeast. Xu and Jia then turned northeast and flew to search and reconnoiter the areas of Zhangrishan, Tiechaishan, Niutaishan, Fenghuangshan, and Shengshui. In the area between Mishan and Lishui, 10 li northeast of Zhucheng, they discovered a large force of more than a thousand Liu bandits and horses, who were fleeing northwest at a very fast pace, divided into a dozen teams. When they saw the planes arrive, they scattered in panic. Xu and Jia then dropped eight heavy bombs, killing dozens of bandits and dozens of horses. This place was already more than a hundred li away from the Lu army's pursuing troops. Because Xu and Jia had insufficient gasoline, they could not fly low to strafe with machine guns, so they immediately turned back. On the way, they encountered Sun Tonggang's plane and guided it to Zhucheng to drop bombs, and dropped a communication bag in Zhucheng, instructing them to defend against Liu bandit's attack on the city. They then returned to Linyi to refuel. At 3 pm, Zhou and Zhao arrived in Xuzhou. Zhou and Zhao flew again to the bandit area in the afternoon to drop bombs, bombing and killing forty to fifty bandits. They returned to Xuzhou that night. According to Xu, on the night of the 13th, Liu bandit broke through the Lu army's heavy encirclement from Taohuashan and fled fiercely north, advancing more than a hundred li overnight. Chairman Han of Shandong Province originally planned to use heavy troops to divide into three fronts, northwest, south, and east, to encircle Liu bandit, press towards the Rizhao coast, drive them to the coast, and annihilate them in one fell swoop. Therefore, Liu bandit desperately rushed out from the north and fled to Zhucheng again. If the military strength on the Jiaoji Road is weak, Liu bandit will probably flee to Jiaodong.

<p>(Xuzhou) Two central bomber planes flew to eastern Shandong again on the morning of the 14th to reconnoiter and saw that Liu bandit had fled to the area between Mishan and Lishui, 10 li north of Zhucheng, with about a thousand cavalry, who were fleeing northwest. They then dropped eight heavy bombs, killing dozens of bandits. At that time, the Lu army's pursuing troops were quite far from the bandits, so they dropped a communication bag in Zhucheng, instructing them to strictly guard against it. On the way back, they encountered Sun Tonggang flying east in a plane, and guided him to the bandit area to bomb. They returned to Xuzhou in the evening. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) If the successor of Army Minister Hayashi is realized early, it is worthy of attention what policies the top leadership of the army will adopt towards the government. However, it is believed that they will be attached to certain conditions. Although the content is still unclear, it is generally to solve the extraordinary situation proposed by Army Minister Araki after the May 15th Incident. It is necessary to establish thorough work in all departments at home and abroad, and implement it as soon as possible as a prerequisite. The specific items include establishing a proactive and thorough national defense policy that focuses on solving the Manchurian problem, thoroughly implementing the organization and integrity, and thoroughly implementing ideological and educational countermeasures and rural countermeasures. However, since the establishment of the current cabinet, successive army ministers have repeatedly proposed these issues, and the government has also recognized them, but their actions are extremely mild and slow. If this situation continues in the future, there is a risk of causing serious consequences. Therefore, it is advocated that the government must be awakened to this point. The atmosphere among young officers is even stronger, so the trend of the problem is quite significant. (14th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Sadao Araki resigned as Army Minister, the power of the military department suddenly declined. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon, and the financial groups and political parties have been able to take advantage of this opportunity to vigorously suppress the military department. The timing they hoped for was the 65th session of the Diet and the cabinet meeting after the Diet, and the following principles for foreign affairs and Manchuria were determined: (1) To condemn the military department's warmongering and to restrain its hasty and reckless policies of aggression against the United States, Russia, and North China. (2) To oppose the Kwantung Army's conspiracy to seize the full power to govern Manchuria. The Kwantung Army had to agree to reduce the organization of its special affairs department recently, and all policies towards Manchuria still belong to the control of the central government. (3) The financial groups' free investment in Manchuria is not restricted by the Kwantung Army. (4) The Kwantung Office governs the Manchurian Railway Attached Lands, and criticizes the Kwantung Army's claim to govern the puppet organization. It also took advantage of the opportunity of Zheng Xi and the two traitors visiting Japan to consolidate its policy principles regarding Manchuria. However, Army Minister Hayashi did nothing, and the young officers of the military department were extremely indignant. Army Minister Hayashi felt the heavy responsibility and proposed his resignation. The military department's anger towards the political parties and financial groups then turned to the Saito Cabinet, believing that the current cabinet could not assume the important political task of the extraordinary situation, and would take advantage of Army Minister Hayashi's resignation to demand that Prime Minister Saito earnestly implement the military department's policies, otherwise it would threaten with the so-called "final awakening of the military department." The fate of the Saito Cabinet is like a candle in the wind. (14th Hualian Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The top leaders of the Seiyukai observe the current state of the political situation as follows: Even if the government solves the problem of Army Minister Hayashi, depending on the progress of a certain major event, the cabinet will inevitably collapse.

<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the meeting of the three army chiefs tonight or tomorrow, if Army Minister Hayashi's intention to resign is firm, the government expects the military department to recommend a successor to Army Minister and happily accepts it, striving to sweep away the political unrest. According to one saying, when the military department recommends a successor to Army Minister, it is said to be attached to Manchurian issues, national defense issues, and rural issues as conditions for joining the cabinet. However, most opinions believe that even without conditions, the army's policy can be discussed with the government after joining the cabinet. Therefore, if Army Minister Hayashi still insists on resigning, it will be decided to have another suitable person join the cabinet. The audience will be requested on the morning of the 16th, and the investiture ceremony will be held immediately. (15th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Saito Cabinet Like a Tumbler (Japanese Communication) The Reason Why Saito Can Continue Numerous Internal Contradictions of the Warlords <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>During the 65th Diet session, the Saito Cabinet repeatedly faced dangerous situations. In principle, it should have long since ceased to exist. Araki's resignation can be interpreted as the Japanese military has always been independent of the government, and does not involve the entire cabinet, which is possible. However, the Minister of Commerce and the Minister of Education, both important cabinet members, were forced to resign at the same time due to so-called disciplinary issues, yet the cabinet still exists. This is considered strange by most Japanese people. The reasons why Saito can maintain his position are: First, the struggle between the warlords and the financial groups has not yet resulted in a clear victory or defeat. Although the army can use force to seize power, it can no longer take actions like the May 15th Incident, or even more violent actions, to completely concentrate power in the hands of the warlords by inciting so-called extraordinary incidents. Second, the financial groups can only passively conserve and cannot take active offensive actions. In other words, they can only maintain the shell of parliamentary politics and cannot revive the spirit of parliamentary politics. Third, under the current situation, it is impossible to find a person more suitable and more able to mediate between the warlords and the financial groups than Saito Makoto. Because several candidates for prime minister, in terms of personal relationships and general political views, are either biased towards the military or come from political parties, and they would inevitably offend one side of the warlords and the financial groups. As a result, none of them can come to power. The only option is to let Saito continue.</p>
<p>After the 65th Diet session ended, the life of the Saito Cabinet was no longer in the hands of the Diet, but decided by Prince Saionji Kinmochi, the elder statesman sitting in Oiso. When Saito visited Saionji, he expressed his own opinion that he could continue. Saionji also advocated that he continue and persuaded him to make it difficult for himself. Because Saionji still adhered to his theory of constitutional normalcy, in other words, he did not approve of the warlords' dictatorship, and of course, he opposed overthrowing the constitution. Therefore, in Saionji's view, overthrowing the Saito Cabinet and having Araki come to power was absolutely inappropriate. Therefore, the Saito Cabinet must consider how to implement proactive policies and how to supplement the practical issues of the Minister of Education.</p>
<p>The so-called proactive policies roughly consist of two major aspects: First, we are now facing the international crisis of 1936. The Washington Naval Treaty is expiring, and Japan will formally withdraw from the League of Nations from that time onward. At the same time, there are various problems between Anglo-Japanese relations and the Soviet Union. How should these matters be dealt with? Second, the "Manchukuo" puppet state has already had two puppets who have come to the East, and the entire Japanese nation has been playing with them for a while. But how to promote the economy, to put it bluntly, is how to economically control the four northeastern provinces. The answer to the former question is to start with diplomacy, especially with the United States. It is now cracking down on all writings that promote the Japanese-American War or oppose the United States too strongly. In addition to Saito Hiroshi, the ambassador to the United States, exerting diplomatic ability, it recently dispatched the rising aristocrat politician Konoe Fumimaro to the United States to lobby, in order to improve Japanese-American relations and reduce its maritime concerns. The economic control of Manchuria is actually just playing tricks on the puppets at most, and it does not hinder Japan's policies. The most important thing now is still the struggle between the warlords and the financial groups. For example, the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway Company not only affects the Manchurian economy but also involves politics. Judging from the current situation, it will be difficult for the Japanese faction to completely control Manchuria with the warlords and make the financial groups their appendages. In fact, there will probably be many difficulties, and the result will probably be a different way. However, economic annexation of Manchuria is inevitable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are also domestic problems in Japan, namely, reforming the fundamental policies of education, rice countermeasures, and measures to rectify discipline. Regarding education, because the general ideology in Japan has recently deteriorated, whether to the left or to the right, it tends to be illegally extreme. Assassination conspiracies continue to occur, which often shakes society. Left-leaning thought is enough to shake its upper class and create a phenomenon of terror. Therefore, the Japanese government must have a policy of appeasement. As for the rice problem, it has been debated many times in the Diet, in cabinet meetings, and in general forums. The only result that can be implemented is the government's method of buying up and stockpiling. The so-called rectification of discipline is a matter of morality and probably will not have any major effect on Japan's actual politics. (April 7 in Tokyo)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Liu Bandit Heavily Wounded in Jiaoxian There are Rumors That Liu Himself Was Injured <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Communication: After the remnant bandit Liu Guitang crossed the border into Shandong for the second time, Han Fuju, Chairman of Shandong Province, specially dispatched a large army of 400 to encircle and suppress them. Although there have been repeated victories, because the bandits are all fierce and some foreigners are secretly helping and assisting them, they have not been completely eliminated immediately. It is now reported that Liu's bandits have been repeatedly encircled and suppressed by the Shandong army and have been reduced to smaller groups. One group fled into the territory of Mengyin, and another group of about 500 mounted bandits fled north through Yuligou, Juxian County, to the Qishan Town in Anqiu County. Another group went east, crossed Zhucheng and entered Wangtai Town in Jiaoxian County, and near Hongshiya in the Haixi District of Qingdao. The Zuoshan and Huangqibao stations on the Jiaoji Railway are close to Anqiu, and defense has become particularly tight. After receiving the report, the Jiaolu Bureau specially sent Police Chief Dai Shihan with three platoons of road police on a special train west at 2 a.m. today (the 11th) to consolidate road defense to ensure safety. The Qingdao Municipal Government is also deeply concerned that Liu's bandits will affect the city's security. In addition to writing to the Marine Corps stationed in Chengyang to transfer all of them back to Qingdao to suppress them, the city also sent Qin Guobi, deputy commander of the Defense Corps, leading one platoon of the Defense Corps, along with Li Yuanqing, commander of the First Battalion of the Marine Corps, and soldiers and sergeants of the battalion, totaling about 400 people, on the Jiangli to Hongshiya in the Haixi District to assist in the encirclement and suppression at noon today. The Qingdao Navy also specially dispatched two bombers today to scout Liu's bandits' actions. According to the aircraft report, the observation was unclear due to rain in the morning, and no definite news was obtained. It flew again once in the afternoon to scout, but still did not get any trace of Liu's bandits. All the aircraft have now returned to Qingdao and will continue to scout tomorrow. It is also reported that there are about 500 bandits who have entered Jiaoxian County. After being surrounded on all sides by the Han army, the Han army and Liu's bandits opened fire in the west of Wangtai Town in the southern countryside of Jiaoxian on the 10th. The battle was fierce, and Liu's bandits suffered heavy casualties. Liu Guitang himself was seriously injured. There were many foreigners under Liu's command, and they are now being closely investigated under the protection of foreigners. If there are suspicious people, they will be taken to the bureau for interrogation. (12th)</p>

<h3 id="e105">Northwest Inspection Record by Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent, Geng Ya <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Geng Ya's Xinjiang Inspection Record is now renamed Northwest Inspection Record. The reasons are: (1) Before Geng Ya set off, he telegraphed Chairman Sheng of Xinjiang. Yesterday, he received a telegram from Chairman Sheng stating that bandits were showing their full strength, and they are currently being pursued. Fearing there would be danger, he instructed Geng Ya to postpone his trip. However, Geng Ya had already set off and arrived in Datong. Therefore, he was telegraphed to turn west and inspect Shaanxi and Gansu. However, when the telegram arrived in Datong, Geng Ya had already gone to Suiyuan. Another telegram was sent to Suiyuan, but he had already left for another place. It is still unknown whether he will receive it. (2) The name is the same as Feng Youzhen's Xinjiang Inspection Record, which will be published soon. To avoid misunderstanding, the name has been changed. Please forgive the readers.</p>
<h3 id="e106">To Zhangjiakou <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>On April 1st, at 10:00 AM, I departed from Pingxi and arrived at the Pingsui Railway Station outside Xizhimen. More than ten policemen were busily sweeping and cleaning, presenting a particularly tense scene. Upon inquiry, I learned that it was part of the official work for the "National Railway Hygiene Movement Conference." Entering the station, ticket buyers lined up in order of arrival. Apart from those who had already entered the platform, there were thirty-four people waiting in line to buy tickets, without any crowding or clamor. Those carrying heavy luggage could place it beside the queue, with the police taking care of it and the owners keeping an eye on it, so that it would not be confused or lost. Women or soldiers, even if they arrived later, were allowed to buy tickets out of turn. In reality, most soldiers traveled by presenting their passports without buying tickets, and those who did buy tickets were usually accompanied by family members. Other service personnel, such as those at the "weighing scale," "luggage check-in," "information desk," and "ticket inspectors," were mostly able to fully provide convenience to passengers and merchants in various aspects without harming the interests of the railway bureau. I had previously heard that the tracks of the Pingsui Railway were old and dilapidated, and that the revenue was poor, so I expected the services to be casual. However, upon seeing this situation, I was quite surprised. In particular, the orderly maintenance by the police and the orderly ticket-buying process were indeed good phenomena not found on other railways. "If you hold an axe to hew an axe-handle, the pattern is not far off." Are those responsible for maintaining order on other railways interested in this?</p>
<p>Recently, in order to support the development and exploitation of agriculture and industry in the Northwest, and to facilitate passengers and merchants, the Pingsui Railway Bureau has added two additional trips to the three weekly special express trains to Baotou. These trains transport grain and miscellaneous goods eastward, and export tea westward. The freight rates for tea, brick tea, and tea dust have all been specially reduced. As a result, merchants can travel more conveniently, and the railway's revenue has also increased. The entire length of the railway is over 800 kilometers. In the years of 1924 and 1925, the annual revenue was over 11 million yuan. Later, due to the impact of wars and frequent disasters, the annual revenue gradually decreased, almost to the point of bankruptcy. However, in 1933, the revenue suddenly increased to 9.09 million yuan, and the prospect of recovery is quite promising. It is said that the Director, Shen Chang, has already drafted a recovery plan. For construction, the first priority is to replace the sleepers. Most of the 1.53 million sleepers on the entire line have long exceeded their service life, and at least 363,500 sleepers should be replaced. The second priority is to purchase steel beams and steel rails. For machinery, the priorities are to install air brakes, purchase locomotive and vehicle parts, and expand the repair shops. For operations, the priorities are to establish long-distance telephone lines and electrical railway signal systems. In total, the construction, machinery, and operations departments will require more than 2.55 million yuan. Furthermore, due to the steep and dangerous slope of the Guanggou section, a special situation (details below), there is also a proposal to change the route. The new route has already been surveyed. It is longer than the old route, and the project is huge, so it may not be easy to realize.</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM, the bell rang and the train departed. It consisted of twelve cars, including one first-class car. The passengers in the third-class cars were more crowded. After the ticket inspection, I learned the reasons. First, soldiers with passports could ride in first class. Second, it was the school vacation season, and there were many students traveling. Third, family members of soldiers and merchants who frequently traveled, even though they only had third-class tickets, used the excuse that the third-class cars were too crowded and sat down in the first-class cars. Therefore, there were few actual first-class ticket buyers, but many people vying for seats in the first-class car. At Qinghuayuan Station, Tsinghua University was in sight. At Changping Station, I saw more than twenty small donkeys with saddles, led by donkey drivers, vying to pick up passengers. No one got off the train, so everyone squatted down to watch the wheels of the train move forward again. The city is more than ten miles from the station. The broken and incomplete walls of the city can be vaguely seen between the dark yellow willow branches.</p>
<p>Nankou Station has a railway locomotive factory. The tracks are complex, with large and small locomotives arranged in a variety of ways, all with their fires lit and ready to go. Small locomotives use five or seven pairs of wheels and are used for traveling on flat roads. Large locomotives use ten or fourteen pairs of wheels. The size and power of the machinery are twice as great as those of small locomotives. From here onwards, the slope begins, and the small locomotive is replaced with a large one. When we arrived, the train had twelve cars, half of which were detached. Six cars went first, with the large locomotive at the rear, pushing with force. Leaving the station, I first saw the "Monument to the Martyrs of the National Army's Nankou Battle," which was more than thirty feet tall and could be seen from dozens of miles away. It was built by Feng Yuxiang. Not five miles further, the train entered the steep mountain pass of thousands of feet, slowly ascending. The slope at Dongyuan Station became steeper and steeper, going up and down again. The fire was fully stoked, and the train began to climb again. I heard that the locomotive at the rear required twice the fire power as one at the front. However, if the locomotive was at the front, there was a risk that the rear cars would be pulled off and break, causing a great danger. Passing through the Juyongguan tunnel, the Great Wall wound along the top, forming a dangerous terrain. One can imagine the value of "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand men cannot pass" in the old days. In the past, the Zhili-Fengtian Allied Forces defeated the National Army at Nankou. The National Army had retreated for two days, but the Allied Forces still bombarded them without daring to pursue, because of the fearsome natural barrier. Passing through another tunnel, we arrived at Qinglongqiao. A bronze statue of Zhan Tianyou, the founder of the railway, stood at the station. Dozens of male and female college students traveling were resting on the winding Great Wall. Among them, pairs of men and women left the group and went elsewhere, either playing with stones by the stream or talking under the pine trees, which was quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>The journey from Nankou to Qinglongqiao took three quarters of an hour. From here onwards, the road gradually became lower and flatter. The locomotive was changed to a small one. The climate also seemed colder. The ice in the streams was thickly accumulated and had not yet melted. The spring scenery of tender yellow willow branches and slightly green grass in the plains was no longer visible. Passing through the Badaling tunnel took five minutes. Outside the tunnel was a small town with solid buildings, but it was desolate and terrifying. Kangzhuang was all flat land. The train stopped for half an hour, waiting to pick up the remaining cars that had been left at Nankou, and then set off together. Huailai City relied on the mountain slopes and possessed a strategic advantage. Feng Zhanhai's army of 17,000 men was stationed in the city. Hsiahuayuan had a line of poles like telegraph poles, coming from the distant mountains. I heard that it was a coal transport mechanism. It was a pity that I could not see it in operation. The ice on the river beside the road gradually melted, and the Huangshui River rushed rapidly, sometimes splashing waves on the sand surface, sometimes flowing secretly under the ice. The ice blocks collided with each other, making a clanging sound. There was little soil, sand, gravel, grass, or trees. At dusk, the smoke from cooking fires rose everywhere, and the cold air attacked. There were many grains transported eastward at each station, indicating the abundance of products in the Northwest.</p>
<p>There were five Russians in my carriage. I heard that they were managers of the Dehua Trading Company in Zhangjiakou. Zhangjiakou, along with Dolon and Guihua, was opened as a commercial port in 1914, and commerce has been increasing and developing ever since. The primary destination for its import and export goods is Kulun, followed by Dolon. During the Kulun Incident in 1929, the capital of Chinese merchants in that area, some with 100 to 200 thousand yuan, was completely confiscated, totaling more than tens of millions of yuan. People wanted to return, but it was difficult. Since the transportation was cut off, our commercial relations were terminated. Initially, the Russians had established the Xihai Company in Zhangjiakou. Later, due to the severance of relations between China and Russia, it was renamed Dehua Trading Company, which monopolized the trade between Kulun and Zhangjiakou. The imports were mushrooms, crystals, furs, etc., and the exports were tea. The annual business was about seven to eight million yuan. After the resumption of relations between China and Russia, its activities became even more vigorous. Chinese merchants wanted to restore trade relations with Kulun, but it was ineffective to negotiate directly with Kulun. When they turned to negotiate with the Soviet Union, they were told that the authority was not there. This has been delayed until now. Furthermore, Dolon has been captured by the Japanese puppets, and the commerce in Zhangjiakou has fallen sharply. Merchants in Zhangjiakou are privately discussing and all want to request the government to find ways to remedy the situation. It was already 9:00 PM when the train arrived in Zhangjiakou. Hotel staff holding paper lanterns lined up outside the station to greet passengers. I got off the train and stayed at the New Hotel.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Liu Xiang Telephones about the Suppression of Bandits in Tongjiang; All Sichuan Army Units Achieve Great Victories; Also Describes the General Situation of the Three-Phase Military Operations <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Chengdu Dispatch: Since the Sichuan Army began its full-scale bandit suppression in October of last year, it has successively recovered the areas of Zhaohua, Guangyuan, Jian'ge, Langzhong, Cangxi, Nanchong, Yingxian, Peng'an, Yilong, Qu County, Xuanhan, Dachuan, Wanxian, Banan County, and Nanyue County, totaling fifteen counties. Among them, the seven counties of Nanba, Yingxian, Yilong, Xuanhan, Dachuan, Wanxian, and Nanba were completely occupied by the bandits, while eight-tenths of the areas of the remaining nine counties were occupied by the bandits. More than 230,000 troops were mobilized. The strength of the bandits, excluding guerrilla units and special detachments, consisted of twenty-six divisions in eight regular Red Army corps, with a total strength of more than 150,000 troops. The total number of bandit deaths and injuries exceeded 80,000. The total number of people killed by the bandits was approximately one million. The tragic sacrifice was unparalleled in three hundred years, except for Zhang Xianzhong's devastation of Sichuan. Fortunately, the bandit suppression armies were extremely diligent, and the people also cooperated effectively with the government troops, striving forward together. Currently, only Tongjiang County has not been recovered, and only 60 to 70 thousand bandits remain. It may not be difficult to completely eliminate them in the short term. On the 9th, Liu Xiang reported the bandit suppression situation and recent victories to various parties, stating: "Since the issuance of the third-phase general offensive order, the progress of each unit in the entire Sichuan bandit suppression situation is as follows: (1) The main force of the Red Bandits is still concentrated in the Five Roads area. The main figures of the bandits, from the puppet chairman Zhang Guotao, the puppet Fourth Front Army commander Xu Xiangqian, the puppet General Political Department Director Chen Changhao, and the puppet Sichuan-Shaanxi Province Chairman Xiong Guobing, downwards, are all supervising the battle in this area. Recently, the bandit forces have heavily fortified this area, which is also based on high mountains and broken cliffs, extremely dangerous. Our Five Roads Army has launched repeated fierce attacks, suffering thousands of casualties, and initially made very little progress. The bandits then took advantage of the windy and rainy nights to attack from time to time. Later, we changed our strategy, extracting a portion of our forces to launch a surprise attack on Wanyuan from the right flank, catching the bandits off guard. Fortunately, we occupied it, allowing the frontal assault to fully connect quickly. The Liao unit of the Six Roads Army launched another full-line attack on the 2nd and 3rd, fighting hard all night, enduring extreme hardships. The bandit units were unable to withstand the pressure and gradually wavered. For three days and nights, our Five Roads Army finally destroyed and seized the most dangerous strongholds on the bandit's front, such as the Honglingtai, Guanzishan, Maoping, and Baihezhai. Thereupon, the entire line separately bypassed and charged in, and on the 4th, we occupied the Shilon Township, Nilong Township, Luming Township, Qiujiabao, Tudibao, Yankou Township, Chenghuangmiao, Yanshan Township, Ba Township, Luowenba, and other places. The bandits collapsed, and we captured, killed, and wounded more than 2,000 people. In total, the bandit's front was more than 200 li long, and we had been in a stalemate for more than a month. Now, in just a few days, we have completely occupied this mountain range, relying entirely on the central government's prestige and the soldiers' united willingness to die. Only then were we able to achieve this success. On the 5th and 6th, our army bravely attacked again, occupying places such as Xiaolao Guanmiao, Sihe Tan, Qubinkou, Guanyin Township, and Zhenshi Township. On the 7th and 8th, we occupied Wenfeng Mountain, Gaoqiao, Tumen Township, Liuping, Changtan River, Longbei Township, and Jigongzhai. Our front line is now only forty li away from Tongjiang City. The bandits have now all gathered in Tongjiang City, intending to defend it to the death. We have dispatched three teams of aircraft to bomb the city daily, and our large army is continuing its fierce advance, forming an encirclement. Tongjiang will not be difficult to recover in the short term. (2) The Deng Army of the One Roads Army advanced from the northern route, capturing Changchi on the 2nd. The most important terrain in that area is Changchi, which is the highest point. Southwards towards Nanjiang, it is all downhill. The bandit strength in this area is also weaker. With the advantage of both manpower and terrain, and the army's renewed efforts, we captured Nanjiang on the 7th. The Tian unit of the Two Roads Army, coordinating with the One Roads Army, also recovered Baimiao Ao and Xindianzi. (3) The Li-Luo unit of the Three Roads Army attacked Bazhong and is now attacking from the flanks, engaging the bandits in fierce battles. We have already occupied Shitang Township and are advancing towards Qingjiang Ferry. (4) The Yang Army of the Four Roads Army is hampered by the Jiangkou River and the dangerous mountain terrain. Repeated attacks have not been successful. However, the Five Roads Army on the left flank and the Three Roads Army on the right flank are advancing and outflanking them, and they have already made contact. Progress must be made in the coming days. (5) The strategic direction of this bandit suppression is to encircle and annihilate them, preventing them from harassing neighboring regions and harming the country. Currently, the right flank has occupied Wanyuan, and the left flank has occupied Nanba. Although the central area is advancing more slowly, in terms of the overall situation, the encirclement has been formed. Each unit is continuing to advance fiercely in unison. The bandits are facing enemies on all sides and will find it difficult to resist. This is the general situation of the recent offensive and defensive situation. The Red Bandits have been disturbing Sichuan for more than a year, devastating as many as sixteen counties. The disaster is worse than floods and ferocious beasts. Fortunately, the military and civilians are united and working with sincerity, so there has been such an effect today. However, the great sacrifices made before and after can be imagined. In addition to reporting to the central government, I am sending this detailed report. Liu Xiang, green seal." (April 10th, Guowen News Agency)</p>

<p>Chen Xigen, a farmer from Chenjiazhai, South Xiang North Banqiao, lost his wife in middle age. He entrusted his young child to the care of his mother-in-law's family, and he would often visit to look after the child. In his mother-in-law's family, there was his wife's younger sister, Zhou Abao, who was not yet sixteen years old. She was betrothed to the son of Li Lihua from Jijiacun at a young age. On the night of June 7th of last year, Chen Xigen took advantage of the fact that Abao was living alone, knocked on the door, and forcibly raped Abao. From then on, Abao secretly became pregnant. Abao initially endured in silence, but as her belly grew larger, she was questioned by her mother and told the truth. They negotiated with Xigen, but to no avail. So, through a matchmaker, they sent Abao to her fiancé's house on the 16th day of the first lunar month this spring. That night, she gave birth. Li Lihua was furious and reported the case to the Nanhua Public Security Sub-Bureau, which arrested Chen and sent him to the county. During the interrogation, Chen firmly denied the charges. The court ordered the victim, Zhou Abao, to appear in court. She swore that Xigen had forcibly raped her. The county court sentenced Chen Xigen to seven years of imprisonment for raping a woman under the age of sixteen through violence and coercion.</p>

<p>Sun Tiezhou (Sun Qiyong), who once served as the Director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Director of the Military Supply Department of the Jiangsu Governor's Office, is a well-known gentleman in Suzhou. Recently, after resigning from the position of Director of the Zhenjiang Navigation Administration Office, he was accused by Tan Boqi, Director of the Registration Office under the jurisdiction of the Zhenjiang Navigation Administration Office, of illegally levying taxes, embezzling public funds, and committing fraud. The Ministry of Transportation forwarded the accusation to the Ministry of Justice, which issued it to the Jiangsu High Court for transfer to the Wu County District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

<h3 id="e114">Wuxi Department of Construction to Implement Factory Inspections <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Department of Construction previously received an order from the Ministry of Industry to implement factory inspections. The Central Factory Inspection Office also sent personnel to assist in the process. Director Shen believes that factory inspection is an important policy to improve factory management and labor conditions, and to develop industrial production. Countries around the world have implemented it successively, but China has not yet done so. The Shanghai Municipal Government previously used the fact that Jiangsu Province had not yet implemented factory inspections as an excuse to demand the right to inspect factories in the concessions. Therefore, the inspection work in Jiangsu Province cannot be delayed any longer. Recently, the central government promulgated the Implementation Procedures for Factory Inspections, dividing the process into five phases, each lasting fifteen years, adopting a gradual approach as the standard for implementation. However, at this initial stage of implementation, cooperation with local authorities is essential. Therefore, the Factory Inspector of this department, Cheng Qiyuan, has been specially dispatched to Wuxi to prepare for the work by conducting preliminary inspections. Wuxi has a large number of factories, the most of any county in inland Jiangsu Province, and the inspection procedures are extremely complicated. It is feared that there may be other obstacles and difficulties. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce is being requested in advance to assist in the process. It is also heard that Committee Member Cheng is scheduled to arrive in Wuxi on the 17th. The county government has decided to invite representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and factory managers to a meeting to discuss the implementation of the inspection and clarify its intentions, so as to avoid various misunderstandings.</p>

<p>The case of Li Shuyun, the wife of former Civil Affairs Director Gu Renfa, which caused a national sensation, has become very amiable since Li Shuyun was released on bail and went to Shanghai for medical treatment. If they can understand each other and reconcile, the broken mirror may be mended. Therefore, this case has become calm after being sensational. However, the fuse of this case was the refusal of Liu Zhuomin, the former director of the Second Public Security Bureau, and his wife, Wen Rongzhen, to hand over their accounts. Liu Zhuomin and his wife are still being held in custody at the detention center. The other day, the County Court Prosecutor's Office issued summons to Sun Zhongjie, a former officer of the Second Public Security Bureau and current officer of the Third Public Security Bureau, and Xia Hongwen, a guard at the Guangfumen Outpost of the Second Public Security Bureau, scheduling them to appear in court for questioning on the afternoon of the 16th. It is said that the Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered the county to forward the letter to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Additional Construction Fee on Salt <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>After the National Government promulgated the new Salt Law last year, the main principle was to build warehouses to consolidate salt production in each area into warehouses. Recently, the Ministry of Finance issued a special order to the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Office to comply with the matter of adding a construction fee to each salt field. The office printed and issued a public notice stating that, starting from April 11th, a construction fee of one jiao would be added to each dan of refined salt or coarse salt. The local Salt Public Company has also received the above-mentioned order and immediately notified all salt merchants to comply. After receiving the order, the wine and soy sauce industries in the county, due to the recent sharp rise in the price of foreign goods, decided to increase the price of salt by one wen per jin starting today (the 15th). The public notice of the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Envoy's Office is recorded as follows: "On April 7th of this year, we received the following telegram from the Ministry of Finance: Songjiang Transport Deputy Officer, regarding the collection fee of one jiao for warehouse construction in your area, the proposed methods for collection, storage, and expenditure have been reviewed and approved. It is hereby ordered that collection should begin in your area from April 11th. You should comply with this order. We have also previously received an order from the Ministry stating that all salt sold in the territory of your area, whether refined or coarse salt, should be subject to the construction fee." We should comply with the order. All counties under the jurisdiction of this district, as well as Langxi County in Anhui, and Baoshan Jieyi Jiushang Nanchuan, Shanghai Concession, Chongqi Changyinsha, Hengsha Islands, and various special districts, as well as various refined salt companies, which transport and sell refined salt to the commercial ports of this district, should comply with the order to increase the price by one jiao per dan (i.e., one li per jin) starting from April 11th for both refined salt and soy sauce. In addition to notifying the Salt Merchant Association in the Five Districts of Suzhou, a special telegram has been sent to salt stations in various locations to comply with the order. This public notice is issued for the compliance of all merchants and residents in the sales areas."</p>

<p>On the late evening of January 3rd of this year, the Xie Sheng Silk Store on Daishi Bridge suddenly caught fire, spreading to neighboring stores and households, causing losses of over 100,000 yuan. The manager of the silk store, Fan Wenjing, and the insurance broker, Su Jinchu, were suspected of instigating arson and were detained and sent to court for interrogation. After the Prosecutor's Office completed its investigation, it filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 187, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, which deals with endangering public safety. Judge Liu Bingyu summoned witnesses for separate hearings five times. However, the case was complex and difficult to conclude quickly. On the 12th of this month, Judge Liu again held a public hearing with more than ten people related to the case. Fan hired lawyer Xiang Binghu to appear in court as his defense, and Su hired lawyer Zhang Tong as his defense. The court hearing lasted for a long time before the arguments were declared closed and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the 14th. Fan and Su were returned to custody, and Zhang Renshan was released on his original bail. Yesterday (the 14th) at 10:00 AM, the sentence was announced. Judge Liu summoned the detained Fan and Su to the court and read out the main text of the judgment. Fan Jingwen was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment, and Su Jinchu was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. After the sentence was pronounced, the prisoners were ordered to be returned to custody. However, Fan and Su both stated that they did not accept the judgment and would appeal.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Finance Department convened budget conferences with various counties in November 1933, in order to save county expenses. After several months, the conference concluded on the 12th of this month. The county magistrates have redrafted their budgets and submitted them to the Finance Department for submission to the Provincial Government Conference for approval. The aim is to simplify expenditures as much as possible. Whether the burden on the people can be reduced in 1934 will depend on the circumstances after the reports from the counties have been compiled.</p>

<p>Hong Ruilin, a wealthy merchant dealing in paints near Xiaodongmen, has in recent years been converting his residence into a Western-style building with multiple stories, magnificent and resplendent. Behind the residence, he has also developed a garden covering several acres, and in the northwest corner, he built a rockery, employing famous artisans from Yangzhou. The construction has been underway for over a year and is still not completed. It is opened to the public for sightseeing during annual festivals, including the Qingming Festival. The seventh day was the day after Qingming, and students from various schools, as well as those who had visited graves, came in an endless stream. At noon, four children of the late Guo Zhongxiang, who resided in Taiping Temple Lane – Fu, Wenbing, Xiaowangzi – along with their cousins, Yuan Xiangying and Yuan Ruiying, were climbing the rockery in Hong Yuan. As they were dancing and gesturing, full of joy and excitement, a section of the rockery suddenly collapsed. The Guo and Yuan children, along with a young vendor named Liu Zhengcai, tumbled down with the falling rocks. Upon hearing the noise, visitors rushed over and pulled the seven individuals from the rubble. They were covered in blood and their appearances were extremely distressing. It is reported that one of them, Wenbing, has already died, and the others are still in critical condition.</p>

<p>In suggesting the above three points as conclusions, it is to prove the fact that products from our country can be promoted for sale in America. Therefore, we should pay serious attention to this fact and take it as a path to develop commerce with America. According to the reporter's opinion, the company should, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4, Section A, of Chapter 1 of its articles of association, initiate the organization of the China Products Standards Company, send personnel to America to promote tea as its primary business, and promote the products that Mr. Zhou deems marketable as its secondary business. Furthermore, Mr. Zhou is determined to promote tea and, according to Mr. Zhou's budget for the maximum potential loss in the second year of tea sales, he is willing to sacrifice US$6,000 if no one cooperates with him. This spirit of enthusiasm is highly commendable. The reporter suggests that the capital of the company to be established should be set at US$20,000, with US$6,000 designated as sacrificial capital and US$14,000 as operating capital. The sacrificial capital should be raised from those who share Mr. Zhou's aspirations, and the operating capital should be raised from ordinary investors who support the development of foreign trade. This operating capital should be deposited in Shanghai to ensure its safety. In addition, the company should request government approval to issue national goods trial sales bonds to America to purchase the kinds of products that Mr. Zhou considers marketable and try to sell them at the Chicago Exposition to determine the company's secondary business portfolio. Because Mr. Zhou has guaranteed through experience that all products deemed marketable can be sold for profit, the issuance of these bonds is considered to have very little risk. The company's capital is set at US$1 per share, and the bonds are set at RMB 10 per bond to make them easy for the people to purchase. The bond interest rate is set at 1%, to be repaid in five installments on a monthly basis, with each installment repaying 5% of the bond principal. Interest will be paid with the final installment. 50% of the profit from the bond-funded product purchases and operations will be returned to the bondholders, and 50% will be for the benefit and compensation of the China Products Standards Company and this company. In this way, bondholders can be risk-free, and the risk borne by this company seems minimal. Therefore, the above suggestions are made, advocating that this company adopt them in accordance with its aspiration to promote domestic goods and assist production. It is heard that the company's managing director, Wu Zhihao, and general manager, Wu Tingsheng, have expressed their support for this proposal and have instructed the design department to draft an implementation plan for submission to the board of directors and supervisors for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Forty Chinese Cigarette Factories Petition for a Meeting to Discuss Cigarette Tax Rates <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Twenty-four Chinese cigarette factories, including the Minzhong Cigarette Company, have repeatedly petitioned the government to revise the tax rates. Since the petitions did not contain concrete proposals, the Minzhong Company, the original proposer, is now putting forward a proposal. The number of factories supporting the revision of tax rates has increased from twenty-four to forty. The text of the petition is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Petition for convening a meeting to publicly discuss cigarette tax rates. It has been found that twenty-four cigarette companies, including Minzhong, jointly petitioned to revise the current cigarette tax rates due to unequal treatment between Chinese and foreign companies, in order to seek relief. The Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department responded with a letter asking the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association to submit the matter to a general meeting of members for discussion. It was decided to appoint nine review committee members for public review. The review committee then produced a written opinion stating the results and sent it to the association, which forwarded it to the Taxation Department. The original written opinion stated that after the implementation of the two-tier tax system, the annual losses to national tax revenue, cigarette merchants, and tobacco farmers amounted to 44,656,796 yuan, while British-American Tobacco Company enjoyed special privileges worth more than 21,640,000 yuan. These figures were based on accurate data. In theory, there were various reasons why the two-tier tax system could not exist, and the opinion was very thorough. It proposed the organization of a cigarette tax rate review committee, with committee members from the Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, Taxation Department, and Chinese Cigarette Factory Association, to hold public discussions in order to determine appropriate and sound tax rates. This would meet the government's financial needs, promote social and economic development, and align with the people's ability to bear the burden, which is extremely fair and easy to implement. However, one month has passed, and the Taxation Department has not taken satisfactory action. The British-American Tobacco Company, taking advantage of this tax increase, continues to enjoy special privileges and drastically reduces cigarette prices, engaging in fierce aggression against Chinese merchants. For example, the price of "Three Cannon Towers" cigarettes has been reduced from 1.1 yuan per tin to 1 yuan. "Caliq" cigarettes have been reduced from 1.7 yuan per tin to 1.6 yuan. "Wuhua" cigarettes have been reduced from 0.5 yuan per tin to 0.4 yuan. The prices of other brands have also been reduced significantly, resulting in a sharp increase in sales and a great loss for Chinese merchants. This further illustrates the importance of tax rates and the severity of foreign oppression. In the past two to three years, the number of Chinese cigarette factories has fallen from 150-160 to 40-50, accounting for two-thirds of the total, all due to unequal tax rates. Learning from past mistakes, unless cigarette tax rates are reformed, Chinese merchants have no hope of survival. Cigarette tax is a pass-through tax. If the tax increase is fair, the increased amount can be passed on to smokers. For example, in this two-tier tax system, the tax increases by 25 yuan per case, which is only 0.5 cents per ten cigarettes. If it can be passed on, smokers will not feel it is too much. If it cannot be passed on, the manufacturers have to bear it. In other words, the increased cigarette tax collected by the government is entirely taken from dozens of Chinese cigarette manufacturers, who will inevitably go bankrupt one after another. Take low-grade cigarettes as an example. The selling price is 120 yuan per case. After deducting the old tax of 55 yuan, the remaining amount is only 65 yuan. Packaging costs at least 30 yuan, leaving only 35 yuan for the business. If the increased tax of 25 yuan cannot be passed on to smokers, the business will only have 10 yuan left. Manufacturers will not be able to manufacture. For those who mainly operate low-grade cigarettes, what other way can they survive besides bankruptcy? In the past two to three years, every time the government increased taxes, many Chinese merchants went bankrupt. The key lies in this. If asked why the tax cannot be passed on, it is because the tax rates set in previous tax increases were unequal, with taxes on low-grade cigarettes increasing while taxes on high-grade cigarettes decreasing. Take this tax increase as an example. The tax on cigarettes with a registered price of 250 yuan or less per case was 55 yuan, which has been changed to 80 yuan for cigarettes with a registered price of 300 yuan or less. That is, the tax on cigarettes priced at 250 yuan or less has increased by 25 yuan, while the tax on cigarettes priced between 250 yuan and 300 yuan has decreased by 15 yuan. When taxes on low-grade cigarettes increase, merchants certainly want to increase prices to pass the burden on to smokers, but high-grade cigarettes enjoy tax relief, so operators of high-grade cigarettes can take advantage of the tax reduction to drastically reduce prices to attract customers. Every time the government revises tax rates, British-American Tobacco Company reduces prices, which is solid proof. At this time, operators of low-grade cigarettes have less resources than those of high-grade cigarettes, but bear a greater tax burden. Therefore, in market competition, if they do not increase prices, the burden will increase sharply, inevitably leading to losses. If they increase prices, high-grade cigarettes will reduce prices to dump their goods, inevitably leading to sluggish sales and rapid spoilage, wiping out capital. Therefore, they are caught in a dilemma. In recent years, all cigarette companies have painfully refrained from increasing prices in order to maintain their original position. Therefore, the result of the tax increase is nothing more than forcing manufacturers to bear the full amount of the new tax increase. In the era of the seven-tier tax system, the tax on each case of low-grade cigarettes was just over 29 yuan. Now it is 80 yuan per case, nearly three times as much, but the market price has not actually increased accordingly, which is clear evidence. From this perspective, the failure to pass on the new tax to smokers is due to the oppression of unequal tax rates. Therefore, to put it bluntly, the increase in unequal tax rates gives high-grade cigarettes a chance to dump their goods, while simultaneously giving low-grade cigarettes a fatal blow. In other words, it gives British-American Tobacco Company a chance to dump their goods and Chinese merchants a fatal blow. In the past two to three years, more than two-thirds of Chinese cigarette merchants have gone bankrupt. Can it be said that this is not caused by poor tax rates? This is from a commercial perspective. The current tax rate must be revised. As for tobacco leaves, the native tobacco leaves produced in Susong, Huanggang, Xinchang, Dengzhou, Guanjun, Guangshui, Junzhou, and other places sold approximately 390,000 bundles annually during the seven-tier tax era before 1930. In January 1930, when the three-tier tax system was introduced, the amount decreased to 265,000 bundles annually. In February 1932, when the two-tier tax system was introduced, the amount further decreased to 115,000 bundles. After the new tax rate was implemented last December, low-grade cigarettes had no sales channels, and these tobacco leaves were ignored. Tobacco farmers have simple minds and have never studied cigarette tax rates. Therefore, although tobacco farmers in Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces have suffered the disaster of rural bankruptcy due to poor cigarette tax rates, they still do not know the reason. Merchants are both the purchasers of native tobacco leaves and the bearers of cigarette taxes, so they know the most. The period of cigarette tax reductions and increases coincides with the period of sluggish sales of local tobacco leaves, echoing each other like shadows following a body. There is a causal relationship, which is obvious to all. If an on-site investigation is conducted in Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, it can be clearly shown. The original written opinion of the review committee stated that the loss to tobacco farmers after the implementation of the two-tier tax system was 5.15 million yuan per year. This is based on the recent price of tobacco. If calculated based on the seven-tier era in 1930, the average price of local tobacco leaves was 0.2 yuan per pound, and approximately 390,000 bundles were sold annually, each bundle weighing approximately 250 pounds, totaling 96,500,000 pounds, worth a total of 19.3 million yuan. Currently, due to heavy taxes on low-grade cigarettes and sluggish sales, tobacco farmers' annual income of over 19 million yuan has vanished, and they are inevitably doomed. Local porters, boatmen, and native tobacco leaf merchants also become unemployed. Poor tax rates have such a serious impact on the social economy. It is believed that at this time of rural bankruptcy and rampant Red bandits, the government cannot quell the bandits without restoring the rural economy. Without reforming the tax rates that harm China and benefit foreign countries, tobacco farmers will never have hope of recovery. This is from an agricultural perspective. The current tax rate must also be revised. Cigarette tax revenue is approximately 60 million yuan per year, ranking first among inland taxes, and is of great importance to finance. The value of cigarette goods is approximately 120 million yuan per year, making it a major category of imitation machine-made foreign goods, and is of great importance to industry. Native tobacco leaves are an essential agricultural product, and the production area is close to bandit areas, which is also of great importance to the future of bandit suppression. The decision of tax rate is the special privilege of the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the original written opinion proposed that the Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, Taxation Department, and Shanghai Cigarette Factory Association each select several committee members to conduct public discussions, and solemnly stated that meeting the government's financial needs should be the first priority. The opinions also respected the Cigarette Consolidated Tax Regulations announced by the government and adopted the two principles of the seven-tier system according to customs valuation and ad valorem taxation. It is hoped that the Taxation Department will follow the principle of public opinion and handle the matter as soon as possible. However, in the blink of an eye, a month has passed without any approval. The Chinese and foreign merchants can no longer endure the poor tax rates. Therefore, it is requested that the government immediately approve the request made in the written opinion of the Review Committee of the General Meeting of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association and conduct public discussions led by the administrative and legislative branches. The main focus should be on complying with the Consolidated Tax Regulations and establishing a strict seven-tier tax system and fair ad valorem tax rates. At this time of commercial war, foreigners are cunning in every way. Only by discussing tax rates in public can the truth be revealed. A fair tax rate that increases tax revenue can be achieved. Not only will our country's industry benefit immensely, but the future of bandit suppression and tax revenue will also see great results. Furthermore, if the government follows Article 5 of the Cigarette Consolidated Tax Regulations, assessing the tax rate of 32.5% according to the customs valuation and dividing it into seven tiers, according to the number of cigarettes sold in Shanghai in February, the tax revenue should be 723,877.875 yuan, which is 79,157.875 yuan more than the current tax rate. The annual increase would be 949,894.500 yuan. Shanghai accounts for just under one-tenth of the national tax revenue. Therefore, if the ten-tier tax system is implemented nationwide, the annual increase in tax revenue would be over 9 million yuan. Five types of forms are prepared separately: (A) Statistical Table of Cigarette Sales and Tax Revenue in Shanghai in February, (B) Table of the Number of Cases of Cigarettes Sold in Shanghai in February Reassessed Based on the Assumed Seven-Tier Tax Rate, (C) Comparison Table of the Assumed Seven-Tier Tax Rate and the Current Two-Tier Tax Rate, (D) Table of the Percentage of the Assumed Seven-Tier Tax Rate and the Current Two-Tier Tax Rate for the Total Cigarette Sales in Shanghai in March, (E) Comparison Table of the Budgeted National Tax Revenue Based on the Assumed Seven-Tier Tax Rate and the Current Two-Tier Tax Rate. Each table is accompanied by an explanation to prove that the seven-tier tax system is beneficial to the government's tax revenue and Chinese merchants' business. On the contrary, the two-tier tax system only benefits British-American Tobacco Company and is detrimental to the government and Chinese merchants. What to choose? The government should investigate further and it will be easy to see the truth. This petition is submitted to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, Military Affairs Commission, and Taxation Department by the following petitioners: Minzhong Cigarette Company, Fuxin Cigarette Company, Huaxing Cigarette Company, Datong Cigarette Company, Meixing Mingji, Huamei Tobacco Company, Zhonghe Tobacco Company, Huabi Tobacco Company, Fuchang Cigarette Company, Hexing Tobacco Company, Daxing Cigarette Company, Huafu Cigarette Factory, Zhongyuan Cigarette Company, Donghai Cigarette Factory, Zhida Xinji Cigarette Company, Huaping Cigarette Company, Shanghai China Taiping Cigarette Company, Youlibaoji Cigarette Factory, Dada Cigarette Factory, Jiangzhe Cigarette Company, Xinhua Cigarette Company, Dachina Cigarette Company, Shanghai Cigarette Company, Jinshatai Ji Tobacco Company, Yuanli Cigarette Company, Fuxing Cigarette Shop, Jiuyigongji Tobacco Company, Changming Tobacco Company, Yonghe Cigarette Company, Huaxin Cigarette Factory, Xinmin Cigarette Company, Jinshan Cigarette Factory, Yicheng Company, Delong Cigarette Factory, Dahua Zhongji Cigarette Company, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company.</p>

<p>The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association held a joint meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members at the association's office at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those in attendance included Tang Jingxi, Zhang Gengshan (represented by Wu Guowei), Shang Mujiang, Cai Hongtian, Su Gongdie, Qu Zhenhua, Lou Hongjun, Xue Fuji (represented by Yang Weiyin), Tong Lizhang, Xu Xiuting, Tong Kechang, Shen Weiya, Jin Liren, Mao Yun, Cheng Zhusun (represented by Shang), Gu Wensheng, Lu Tingjian, Huang Xianggu, Li Weiliang, Du Yuesheng, and others, totaling 21 people. The meeting was chaired by Du Yuesheng and recorded by Shao Bingyuan.</p>
<p>Discussion of various proposals: (1) Proposal to negotiate for an increase in Chinese directors. Chairman Du first reported on the mediation process and stated that the French Consul had requested another month's extension before responding. The members agreed, but resolved that the five Chinese directors legally elected by the association should attend all meetings until the issue of increasing Chinese directors is resolved. Passed. (2) Proposal to reinstate Chairman Du. All committee members stood up to welcome Chairman Du's reinstatement. Chairman Du has agreed to return to his position. (3) Rickshaw license dispute. It was reported that the Rickshaw Association sent a letter detailing that the French Municipal Council had agreed to issue an additional 100 relief licenses, totaling 136, and requested that the association forward a letter to the Municipal Council to expedite the issuance. Resolved: A letter should be sent to the Municipal Council requesting them to proceed accordingly. However, the association should send personnel to supervise the issuance of licenses to avoid disputes. (4) Proposal to ban jai alai and dog racing venues. It was reported that the district branches of the Citizens' Association had sent letters requesting a strict ban. Resolved: Huang Xianggu, Mao Yun, Shang Mujiang, Cheng Zhusun, and Tong Lizhang were appointed as five committee members to draft an official letter for submission to the French authorities requesting a ban. (5) Proposal to study the articles of association of the French Municipal Council and the association. Resolved: The original two committees should be merged immediately. The appointed committee members include Cheng Zhusun, Shang Mujiang, Qu Zhenhua, Gu Wensheng, Wu Xiu, Mao Yun, Zhu Wenqi, Huang Xianggu, Tong Lizhang, and others, totaling nine people, with Cheng Zhusun as the convener. (6) A letter was received from the ten district branches of the Citizens' Association regarding the Xu Jia Hui French Police's infringement of police powers. Resolved: Tang Jingxi was appointed to investigate and then negotiate. (7) A letter was received from the Repair and Sales Bicycle Trade Association regarding the French Municipal Council's increase in taxes. Resolved: The association should wait for the trade association to provide detailed reasons before handling the matter. After the above proposals were discussed and just as the meeting was about to adjourn, a letter was suddenly received from the Shanghai Federation of Machine-Made National Goods Factories, reporting that the French Municipal Council was collecting an annual inspection fee of 70 yuan for the boiler inspection of the Hongxing Socks Factory. Since the issue of factory inspection sovereignty has not been resolved, it is difficult to recognize it and a request for dealing with the matter and negotiation was received. The association immediately forwarded the original letter to the Chairman for handling.</p>
<p>Letter from the Shanghai Federation of Machine-Made National Goods Factories. Yesterday, the Shanghai Federation of Machine-Made National Goods Factories sent a letter to the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to strongly protest the French Municipal Council's collection of inspection fees from the Hongxing Socks Factory. The original text reads: "Respected Sirs, we have recently received a letter from our member, Hongxing Socks Factory, stating that on the 6th of this month, personnel from the Health Bureau of the Concession, accompanied by the Fire Brigade, brought equipment to inspect our factory's boiler and injected 126 pounds of cold pressure. As a result, they deemed it satisfactory and left. Unexpectedly, we received a notice today stating that our factory should pay an annual inspection fee and other fees, totaling 70 yuan, which is deeply shocking. We believe that this is an entirely new initiative for factories, and our factory cannot rashly set a precedent, etc.," and a photograph of the French notice is attached. We have learned that the issue of factory inspection rights has been disputed between the Chinese and foreign authorities for a long time. Last year, the Public Concession authorities ordered Yiyuan Rubber Factory, etc., to improve and relocate, ostensibly to prevent public danger, but in reality, to seize inspection rights. Now, the French Concession authorities send personnel to inspect factories without prior written notice to the factory, relying only on a business card. If unscrupulous individuals take the opportunity to commit fraud against factories, the French authorities cannot escape responsibility. Furthermore, the collection of inspection fees concerns our country's sovereignty. Before the issue of inspection rights is resolved, there is no basis for discussing this. We have always admired your association as the highest Chinese authority in the French Concession, cherishing national rights and being consistent. We hereby send this letter in preparation, and hope that you will investigate and strongly protest to prevent coveting and guard against pretexts, which is our earnest expectation. Respectfully addressed to the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association."</p>

Chairman Yan Esheng delivered the opening address, followed by addresses from Mao Xiaxuan, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Chen Kecheng, representative of the Municipal Government, and Zhou Hanmei, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau (speeches recorded separately). Then, Chairman Zhao Junhao reported on association affairs, followed by a discussion of proposals. With Hang Shijun presiding, a motion to revise the constitution and increase the number of executive and supervisory committee members was passed. Then, Jin Xiongbai proposed an early election to save time by holding the ballot counting while discussing the proposals. This was passed by a majority. The election ballots were distributed first.

Strict prevention of pseudo-national traitors from infiltrating journalistic activities; B. Renewed request for the realization of job security for reporters; C. Proposal to establish specialized committees; D. Petition for clarification of Article 19 of the Publication Law.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Speeches by Mao and Zhou <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Mao Xiaxuan, representative of the Municipal Party Department, said in his address: "The purpose of the Newspaper Reporters Association is to foster fellowship, promote the profession, and seek job security, thereby benefiting the nation and society. Newspaper reporters are also mentors of the people. Their words and opinions are related to the peace, security, and welfare of the entire nation and society. To seek the rise of the nation, the flourishing of civil rights, and the people's livelihood and happiness, the entire nation must have a true understanding of the Three Principles of the People. Aside from education, the most important means to achieve this goal is public opinion. Therefore, the responsibility of you gentlemen is very heavy, and your mission is great. Reviving the old morality and promoting new construction all depend on you gentlemen. Shanghai's public opinion leads the country. I hope you will all strive to promote the Three Principles of the People and the spirit of the rule of law, and pay particular attention to correcting the bad customs of society, so that society can achieve good results, and the whole country can hear and see and boost morale and save the nation." Zhou Hanmei, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, said in her address: "Today, the national situation is serious, and the international situation is dangerous. The only way to revive the nation is to thoroughly change the Chinese people's mentality of luck and self-doubt. Because our country's great problem is not imperialism and feudal forces, but the Chinese people's underestimation of themselves, lack of self-confidence, and mentality of luck. Therefore, the national situation has reached this critical point. I deeply hope that you gentlemen will lead the country, promote the New Life Movement, wash away the decadent mentality of the Chinese people, and be the pioneers of the national revival movement."</p>
<h3 id="e136">Speech by Chen Kecheng <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Chen Kecheng, representative of the Municipal Government, said in his address: "Today, I am honored to be appointed to participate in the spring members' convention of the Shanghai Newspaper Reporters Association and gather with you gentlemen. Because of my official duties, I usually have a lot of contact with the press, and I have very good public and private relationships with them. Therefore, once I formally gather and address you, I feel speechless. Moreover, because of the frequent interactions in the past, we are like family. What I want to say must be familiar to you gentlemen. Therefore, I will share some impromptu thoughts and the direction of the authorities' efforts for the press in the future, to express my humble intentions. Shanghai is a major trading port, and its press industry is the most developed in the country. The number of newspapers and news agencies is increasing daily, and significant progress has been made in recent years. However, precisely because of its important location, the gains and losses of its content and quality are closely watched by all regions, and its influence on the national society and people's hearts is the deepest. However, in recent years, the country has been in turmoil, facing internal and external difficulties, and economic panic is even worse here. The press colleagues have stood firm, moved forward bravely, and strived to develop their careers and struggle with the environment, attracting readers and improving their business. Amidst the entire atmosphere of depression, they have opened up a path. Especially in terms of consciousness, they have stood firm and unyielding. In terms of compilation and materials, they have improved with the trends of the times. In terms of ideology, they will always cooperate sincerely with the government, supporting each other for common survival and prosperity. This is the greatest effort of the press gentlemen in recent years, which the government is very pleased with, and hopes to maintain for a long time. However, as the national crisis deepens and the people's livelihood declines, to save the current crisis, it lies in the collective efforts of the Chinese people. The press conveys the truth and leads public opinion, serving as the morning bell of society and the mouthpiece of the people. The so-called awakening of the deaf and the enlightening of the blind depend on us. The weight of responsibility increases daily. Then, how should we improve and make up for our shortcomings in the future, so that we can continuously develop with the times, and at the same time, improve our personal thinking and personality? This depends on the proper planning of the association and mutual encouragement. Furthermore, the organization of your association is a mechanism for colleagues to connect and unite. Its benefits are great, but it must first have a spiritual connection to be worthy of it. Therefore, the prosperity or decline of the association depends on the responsible committee members, but the will of the members must also be completely unified. If so, then the existence of the association has meaning, and the group has strength. Newspaper reporters are freelancers. Although there is no labor-capital relationship, the press industry is a national cause. The association has the key to promoting the press industry. The future leaders will certainly pay more attention to their mission and not slacken in the slightest. This is what I sincerely pray for. Now, I sincerely wish you all good health and boundless progress."</p>

<h3 id="e139">Employee of the China Industrial Bank Embezzles Huge Sums of Depositors' Money, Reaching a Staggering 18,000 Yuan <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Xiong, a 24-year-old Cantonese man working in the savings department of the China Industrial Bank at 1300 North Sichuan Road, residing at 130 Tangjiawan Road, French Concession, was introduced to the bank in 1928 by a Mr. Luo. He opened a "Huili Cosmetics Store" on Nanjing Road. Recently, his business failed, resulting in significant losses. In addition, his household income was not enough to cover his expenses. Therefore, from 1931 to January of this year, he embezzled 18,000 yuan in silver dollars in succession for his own use and then abandoned his job and fled without a trace. After the bank manager discovered this, he negotiated with the guarantor. Later, Zhou sent a letter to the bank, enclosing two warehouse receipts for 22 boxes of cosmetics worth several thousand gold pieces as temporary collateral. He said he would find a way to settle the rest. The other day, Zhou suddenly arrived at the bank, intending to resume his job, but the Hongkou Police Station was notified. Chinese Detective Zhu Jihuang took a warrant from the court and rushed to arrest him, taking him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Municipal Council stated the circumstances and said that the 22 boxes of cosmetics had been deposited in the China Industrial Bank warehouse on North Suzhou Road. Now, the police station is prosecuting him for breach of trust and other crimes under Article 366 of the Criminal Law. The way he embezzled the silver dollars was to increase the amounts withdrawn by customers from the savings department, such as adding 500 or 1,000 yuan to a 1,000 yuan withdrawal, etc., without a fixed amount. The bank is still investigating the accounts of the depositors handled by the defendant. He confessed to everything at the police station and requested a postponement. The letter and two warehouse receipts for the cosmetics were presented for inspection. Judge Wu Zehan questioned the defendant and ordered him to be remanded in custody and the hearing rescheduled.</p>

Xu Shiying was publicly elected as chairman. Regarding the report, First, Committee Member Qu Wenliu reported on the recent work of the general office. Then, Committee Member Chu Minyi reported on the negotiations in Beijing, briefly stating that the Dharma Assembly was approaching, but due to the anticipated large number of participants, it was expected that the hotels in Hangzhou would not be able to meet the demand. Currently, the Hangzhou office has contacted the Hangzhou Hotel Industry Association to set up more temporary lodgings to meet the demand. It has been negotiated properly, and the Hangzhou office has pre-booked over a hundred rooms in major hotels in Hangzhou for the accommodation of devout believers, but the expenses are borne by the guests themselves. As for the Panchen Lama's office, the Zhu Villa has been tentatively designated and is being decorated. Then, the key points of the General Office to be carried out were discussed. Committee Member Qu Wenliu proposed that 15,000 special editions should be published during the Dharma Assembly, and it was proposed that the Citizen's Daily be responsible for handling it, because the newspaper is the only Buddhist daily in the country, and has been promoting Buddhism for two years. It was resolved and passed. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpaying Chinese Residents Association sent letters to the Public Concession Municipal Council and replied to Mr. Qian Longzhang regarding the telephone company cutting off users' telephone lines without reason. The letters are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Lawyer Shen Yiqian <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sir, According to a letter from taxpayer Shen Yiqian, the taxpayer's home telephone number is 31458. On the morning of March 29th at 9:30, the Shanghai Telephone Company suddenly cut off the line, rendering it unusable. When inquiring at number 01, the reply was that the machine was damaged and someone was sent to repair it. When calling the company again in the afternoon, it was said that the line was cut off because the fee had not been paid. The taxpayer immediately sent a letter to the general manager of the company, but there has been no reply to date. However, the taxpayer's telephone bill (from February 1st to April 30th of this year) was paid in full at 8:50 am on March 29th, as evidenced by the receipt. The telephone was still working at 9:10 after the fee was paid. To cut off the telephone line after paying the fee, and without prior notice before the cut-off, is unacceptable. The taxpayer is a lawyer, and the business losses are very significant. It is requested that your association send a letter to the Municipal Council, which manages and supervises the franchised business, to immediately order the company to restore the line and compensate for all losses. The receipt has been sent to the association. Please investigate and handle it together with the letters from our association on March 29th and April 5th.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Physician Qian Longzhang <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sir, According to a letter from taxpayer Physician Qian Longzhang, "The taxpayer's telephone number is 32345. The Shanghai Telephone Company stopped the call without reason. I have written a letter requesting your association to forward it to the management and supervision authority, requesting that it be ordered to restore the call and compensate for the damage. Now, the telephone company restored the call at 9:00 am the next morning after being notified by the company's telephone. So, from the time it was stopped to the time it was restored, it was a total of 24 hours. I have received a letter from the Shanghai Telephone Company on April 4th, saying that it apologizes for any inconvenience caused to the taxpayer due to the erroneous disconnection. I think that the responsibility of the company is to make it convenient for the public. If it makes it inconvenient for people, and it can only apologize to private individuals, it is too trivial to supervise the management agency. The taxpayer will not give up the request for compensation for damages unless the company officially sends a letter of apology to the Municipal Council and your association." This situation has come to the association. Our association believes that Dr. Qian's attitude is very reasonable. Otherwise, it is not enough to see that the Shanghai Telephone Company has a supervisory and management agency above it.</p>
<p>The Taxpayer Association replied directly: We received your letter of April 11th, regarding not directly accepting the Shanghai Telephone Company's apology for the unjustified line cut-off. We have noted everything. Our association believes that this attitude is very correct and has forwarded the letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council. This is a reply to Physician Qian Longzhang.</p>

<p>The Shanghai celebrity Du Yuesheng and Jin Tingsun, accompanied by industrial tycoons Zhu Meixian and Hu Xiyuan, visited the Wuxing Weaving Factory in Yangshupu yesterday afternoon. Manager Ren Shigang and Deputy Manager Luo Qingfan of the factory warmly received them and accompanied them on a tour of the dyeing, weaving, bleaching, and cutting departments. The equipment was perfect, and the layout was well-organized. Everyone praised them. Then, because Mr. Du had long admired the reputation of the China Eupore Electric Factory, and it was very close to the Wuhe Factory, Mr. Hu Xiyuan invited everyone to [jointly go to the Eupore Factory for a visit. They first rested in the reception room, and then were led to visit the light bulb and glass factories. Everyone was amazed by all the facilities, and they all exclaimed that the name was well-deserved. However, the motor factory that manufactures electric fans was too far from the main factory, and there was not enough time, so they did not go to visit. They then went to the conference room for refreshments. On the same day, other groups that visited the Eupore Factory included all the staff and students of the Hebei Provincial Industrial College, the Pudong Middle School, the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, and Datong University. Therefore, the factory staff were quite busy with receptions.</p>

<p>Zhang Zilian, general manager of the Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory in this city, has recently been saddened by the plight of soldiers who were wounded in the war against Japan and the Communists and returned home without a means of livelihood. He plans to initiate the organization of a sanatorium for disabled soldiers, but he is deeply worried because he feels that his strength is limited. In order to find a proper solution, he dares to first solicit the opinions of people from all walks of life, and then ask the government to give him strong support and gradually implement the facilities to the end. Yesterday, he issued a letter to all walks of life (the original text is omitted) to solicit opinions.</p>

<p>The Traffic Department of the Railway Bureau issued a circular to all stations yesterday regarding the extension of the validity date of discount tickets for round trips. The circular stated, "The validity date of the outbound journey of intermodal transportation discount tickets has been limited to three days from the date of issuance. It has been found that employees at various stations often do not have enough time to use these tickets within the validity period when applying for them, and repeated requests have been made to extend the period, which is reasonable. From now on, all discount tickets, whether for the railway or intermodal transportation, will be changed to a validity date of seven days, in line with the domestic intermodal transportation discount tickets. The validity period for the return journey will still be handled according to the previous regulations. In addition, if employees or their family members request to add a 'permitted to ride on special express train' stamp due to time constraints, it should be allowed, except for the Shanghai-Ping express train, to add this stamp and ride on other special express trains of the railway. In addition to reporting to the railway and distributing it to the sub-bureaus, please comply."</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, according to the Shanghai Municipal Fisheries Guidance Institute, the total quantity of various aquatic products produced and sold in the city in March this year was 45,006 dan and 79 jin, with a total value of 735,907.69 yuan. Compared with the previous month, the quantity decreased by 489 dan and 35 jin, while the value increased by 54,633.25 yuan. This is because the various imported seafood products this month were mostly valuable dried products, so the quantity was small but the value was high. Secondly, after the end of the Lunar New Year, the demand for freshwater fish and other products was high, so the value was also higher. As for the city's fishing vessels, although the catch increased, the value decreased. This is due to the impact of the dumping of Japanese fish in the market. The quantity and value of other ice-fresh fish boats, ice-fresh barrels, and various salted fish decreased compared with the previous month. The quantity and value of frozen fish and canned aquatic products both increased slightly.</p>

<h3 id="e158">The Municipal Health Bureau Adds Nine New Hospital Wards; Two to Begin Construction Within Days, Completing in Three Months; The Rest to be Built Sequentially, Completed Within Two Years <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Since Director Li Ting'an took office at the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, he has been determined to rectify the situation, and a new atmosphere prevails. Although after the ravages of war, everything is being rebuilt, and his achievements are remarkable. The Contagious Disease Hospital, recently established on Tongji Road in Zhabei, is perfectly equipped, has excellent doctors, and treats patients with exceptional care. Residents in the vicinity who are infected with epidemics all go there for treatment. Since its opening, only a month ago, the number of people seeking treatment has reached as high as 479. The current 62 beds are far from sufficient. Director Li, in view of this, despite extreme financial difficulties, has saved expenses in every possible way, and raised funds to plan to add nine new hospital wards in the shortest possible time. Two of these can begin construction within days, with a capacity of 50 beds, and are expected to be completed in about three months. In addition, construction will continue sequentially, and it is estimated that they will be completed within two years. These nine hospital wards will all be built according to the latest international designs for contagious disease wards. Once all are completed, the hospital plans to separately house several types of legally defined infectious diseases, limiting each ward to one disease, so that the work of isolation can be fully achieved, and the danger of infection can be avoided. The benefits to sick people will be considerable. However, in recent days, many hospitalized patients have been impatient with their stay. As soon as their condition improves slightly, they request to leave the hospital. Their thinking is still very outdated. This is all due to the failure to popularize education, and the lack of intellectual enlightenment. It is hoped that the education authorities will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Yu Shicheng, the owner of the Fuzhou small steamboat, filed a lawsuit with the Zhenjiang Court due to the sinking of his boat after being struck in Jiangyin. He requested the detention of the Sanbei's Jing'an vessel as an emergency measure. Based on Yu's complaint, the Zhenjiang Court, upon the Jing'an's arrival in Zhenjiang, attempted to seize the vessel without summoning the shipowner for questioning. When shipowner Liu urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Bureau to report this, the Sanbei General Company telegraphed the Zhenjiang Court to inquire who would guarantee the huge losses incurred by the ship detention if the lawsuit was unfounded. After this telegram, the Zhenjiang Court released the ship back to Shanghai. Sanbei has now suspended sailing on the one hand and investigated and learned that the original plaintiff, Yu Shicheng, also resides in Shanghai, and the Jing'an vessel has now arrived in Shanghai for berthing. The shipowner and crew are all in Shanghai awaiting the legal proceedings. Therefore, they requested the Zhenjiang Court to transfer this false accusation case to the Shanghai Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, a letter arrived from Zhenjiang stating that the Zhenjiang Court had granted the Sanbei Company's request, and that the case of whether the Jing'an vessel had sunk the Fuzhou small steamboat would be transferred to the Shanghai Special District Court for trial. The entire case file will be transferred to Shanghai and handed over to the Special District Court, awaiting a scheduled hearing.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhiyun, who was formerly selected as a movie queen, filed a self-accusation against Zhou Xiaobo for violating the cohabitation agreement and endangering public morals. The First Special District Court repeatedly summoned her for questioning, but Zhang never appeared in court. On the one hand, she submitted a statement to the court denying the lawsuit against Zhou, and on the other hand, she made other expressions to her attorney, Dan Yuhua, changing her attitude frequently, which drew the judge's attention. Therefore, at the last hearing, Magistrate Liu specifically instructed Attorney Dan that if she evaded the summons again, she would be detained according to the law and transferred to the Procuratorate. Yesterday afternoon, the date for the hearing arrived again, but Zhang was still not seen. Attorney Dan then submitted a written statement, stating that this statement was personally written by the plaintiff, Zhang Zhiyun, in which she confessed to all her previous improprieties, requested leniency and exemption from investigation, and stated that the case had indeed been settled out of court, and requested that the self-accusation be approved for withdrawal. After examining the statement, Magistrate Liu determined that it was indeed Zhang's writing. Since she voluntarily wanted to settle the dispute, the withdrawal should be approved, and ruled that the case would not be accepted. The Zhang-Zhou dispute has thus been resolved.</p>

<p>The Ren De Tang of Shangjiahang, a guild in Shanghai of natives from Guangzhou and Zhaoqing, has been controlled by the old committee members in recent years. They have privately sold the guild's properties, misappropriated the funds, and failed to disclose information publicly. As the abuses deepened, the Social Bureau ordered the guild to reorganize and instructed Lu Bingjie, a member of the guild, to expedite the rectification. Eleven rectification committee members were elected on the ninth of last month, and many important resolutions were passed. Unexpectedly, the old committee members Chen Enbao and Li Jiafu refused to hand over control and stirred up litigation. Details were in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the defendants in the lawsuit filed by Chen et al. in the First Special District Court include Lu Bingjie, Luo Fuxiang, Chen Xu, Lin Dexian, Liang Ming, Mai Hua, Li Ming, Liang Qing, and eight others. The subject of the lawsuit is a request to declare the resolution of March 9 invalid. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao of the court opened a hearing to summon the parties. About twenty or thirty plaintiffs were present, but none of the defendants were present. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Zhongyin, requested that a letter be sent to the Social Bureau to retrieve the sign-in book of guild members who attended the meeting on March 9, the list of guild members, and the book of those who have received red envelopes. After all the account books are retrieved, they will be reviewed, and the court adjourned to reschedule the hearing.</p>

<p>— Reply from 丨丨 to Wang Yin 丨丨</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yin wrote, inquiring about the ways to study education and what fundamental knowledge is necessary for studying education. We hereby present our opinions in response as follows:</p>
<p>Before entering the main text, let us first ask Mr. Wang Yin, what is the purpose you hold in studying education?</p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Wang Yin will think that we are asking too foolishly. A person has a purpose for doing anything, unless that person is a fool who sows blindly. Yes, we believe Mr. Wang Yin has a purpose, but the problem lies here. If A has a certain purpose for doing the same thing, and B has another purpose, then their achievements and results will inevitably be different accordingly. For example, consider manufacturing poisonous gas. Some manufacture it for the needs of the chemical industry, and some manufacture it to supply the needs of war. The former is beneficial to human society, while the latter is a poison that destroys human society. In doing things, we should not only have a purpose, but also have a proper purpose. If the starting point is wrong, then the entire course of your undertaking will fall into error.</p>
<p>Regarding this question, we can cite some of the most common opinions in the minds of general education researchers to answer.</p>
<p>First, there are those who advocate saving the nation through education. They elevate education to the highest level, believing that education is omnipotent; that education can restore "morality and public sentiment," and that education can save "the dying." When they see that their industry is not as developed as other countries, and that their guns are not as sharp as other countries, they think it is the result of education, so they engage in some kind of military education. When they see the people on the verge of starvation and the whole country in a state of panic, they also think it is the result of education, so they engage in some kind of vocational education, production education. May I ask, is this possible? Can education save a country from decline? Facts have already given us a clear answer: in the past twenty years, Chinese education has had very little effect on the people and the country. Those who study education with this purpose, if they are not intentionally deceiving themselves, willingly helping those with ulterior motives to deceive and anesthetize the people, will inevitably fall into despair and never find a way out.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are those who advocate the purity of education. They believe that education transcends society and is a pure and noble undertaking unpolluted by the secular world. On the one hand, they pride themselves, stubbornly adhering to the prejudice that "all occupations are inferior, only studying is noble." On the other hand, they isolate themselves from society. That is, let the warlords engage in melee, let the bureaucrats be corrupt, education is not affected. May I ask, is this possible? The movement for independent education funding, which has been advocated for more than ten years, still only results in the habit of appropriating education funds for military expenditures. If we are not blind, we will never fail to see these facts. If you must proclaim yourself pure, then unless you are willing to starve to death. It can be seen that education researchers who take this path also have no way out.</p>
<p>So, what is the proper purpose of studying education? A purpose is not determined by one person's imagination, but rather, on the one hand, should be based on the actual needs of society, and on the other hand, should recognize what role the knowledge we study plays in society.</p>
<p>The evolution of education is determined by a certain social productivity and relations of production. Primitive education is inseparable from human life, that is, mental labor is combined with physical labor. With the development of productivity, there was a division of labor in society, and then classes were born. Thus, mental labor and physical labor were split, and education was no longer owned by laborers, but became the exclusive privilege of a privileged class, serving as one of the tools for ruling the people. Under the feudal social system, the rulers were afraid that the people would rise up in rebellion because of hunger, so they promoted the education of "loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness." "Starving to death does not matter, only fear of lacking integrity and not being able to be loyal to the master," this is their main task of education. In capitalist society, because capital production organization requires organized laborers, industrial officers at all levels, there is a capitalist class education system. The task of capitalist education, on the one hand, is nothing more than continuously creating production personnel for the production organization to maintain the production process. On the other hand, in order to expand the market and occupy the market, it attempts to create thousands upon thousands of capital soldiers. This is the essence of so-called military education and patriotic education; as for production education, it is only focused on improving labor intensity, increasing labor productivity, and expanding the exploitation process. In fact, in the late stage of capitalism, as a result of the rationalization of production, the division of labor becomes more detailed, and laborers do not need specialized knowledge, so workers' education is no longer decided by capitalists. Education in modern society is no longer for the people, and it is inevitably the exclusive property of a few people. The so-called public education is just empty talk (to be continued).</p>

<h3 id="e176">Introduction <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The national economy of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. In a nutshell, it is simply the obvious manifestation of the pathological state of the 21st year! In a part of North China, the counties on the border of Hebei and Chahar suffered slightly from war. The Yellow River area of Shandong suffered slightly from floods. Other areas had no major accidents. Politics gradually became stable, and the field harvest was also abundant. However, the general price of agricultural products fell, land depreciated, and farmers became increasingly impoverished. Fortunately, the price of cotton did not fall as severely as other agricultural products; therefore, the rural conditions of the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan were slightly better than those of other provinces. In the central Yangtze River region, Sichuan and Jiangxi were ravaged by communist bandits. Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangsu suffered from the sharp drop in rice prices and the decline of silk and tea. Farmers'</p>
<p>income decreased even more. In a part of South China, remittances from overseas Chinese continued to decline, and rice was supplied from abroad. The society was economically impoverished, even more so than the Yangtze River provinces. Considering China as a whole, the huge loss of Manchurian export trade led to a daily increase in the number of excess imports, and the outflow of raw gold and silver was even greater. Furthermore, the low price of agricultural products caused the people's purchasing power to decrease more and more, and the sales of domestic industrial products became increasingly diminished. This is a phenomenon that should occur during pathological changes, an inevitable result. However, what should be noted is that the pathological state of the 22nd year was mostly due to the repercussions of the global recession. However, like a weak body neglecting hygiene, it is easier for external pathogens to invade. Considering that things become more urgent in times of desperation, the pathological state of the 22nd year was already known in the 21st year. It was only in the 22nd year that the urgency of implementation was realized. During this year, the entire country, from top to bottom, knew that improving the countryside could not be delayed. Furthermore, they knew that improving the countryside, in a negative sense, required removing obstacles and reducing burdens; in a positive sense, it required various economic constructions to proceed simultaneously. Therefore, the central government issued a general order to eliminate all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and improved railway transportation, reduced transportation costs, and increased the construction of highways and railways. It also implemented cotton industry control and promoted cooperative movements. All these measures were aimed at rescuing the countryside and indirectly benefiting from it. Although large-scale plans have not yet been seen, the government, compelled by its own self-interest, gradually realized the importance of cultivating the people's strength. Therefore, who knows if the pain of rural bankruptcy today will not be the price of rural revitalization in the future? This is the image of the turn of fortune amidst the profound and painful experiences of the 22nd year, which is filled with substance and brilliance, and depends on the rising up of the national people!</p>
<h3 id="e177">Bank of China's Operations for the Twenty-Second Year of the Republic (1933) <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The bank's operations in the twenty-second year followed the direction announced in last year's report: reducing deposit interest rates to prevent unnatural credit expansion; lowering loan interest rates to ease the burden on industry and commerce; establishing inland branches to encourage the flow of capital inland; and increasing warehouse facilities to promote the circulation of goods and supplement rural finance. Although the implementation fell short of the desired 20-30%, fortunately, due to the bank's deep relationship with society, these measures have received considerable feedback. This year, inland lending rates gradually decreased, with some reductions of 2-3% compared to previous years. The increasing number of inland financial institutions and the competitive advancement of various rural loan programs are in no small part due to the bank's influence, which is not only fortunate for the general financial sector, but also gratifying to the bank's shareholders. However, despite reduced deposit rates, deposits did not decrease; despite lower lending rates, merchants in various regions were exhausted and lacked good credit; and the prices of various agricultural products plummeted. Even with goods as collateral, there were concerns about stagnation and losses at any time. Therefore, the rate of increase in lending could not match the increase in deposits, and the bank's profits were gradually diminishing. This is an inevitable fact in the face of the general trend of economic downturn, which should be understood by our shareholders. As for the establishment of inland branches and warehouses, it is not possible to achieve these goals in one fell swoop, as it requires cultivating talent suitable for inland areas and planning appropriate facilities. Therefore, gradual progress is necessary. Regarding banking operations, the difficulties faced by branches in the south were greater than those in the north. In Sichuan province, the communists suddenly rose up, and in Jiangxi province, the communists had not yet been completely suppressed. Coupled with the Fujian Incident, all industries were temporarily stagnant, and money houses in Fujian and Guangdong provinces closed down one after another, causing financial chaos. Fortunately, the local branches acted cautiously and did not suffer significant losses. At the same time, they spared no effort to support the market to prevent the collapse of the local financial foundations. However, at a time when the government's laissez-faire economic policy is failing and the old-fashioned commercial and financial organizations are being eliminated, the difficulties faced by the bank in its position are self-evident. The only option is to uphold the bank's long-held principle of prudence, strive to increase efficiency and reduce costs for ourselves to consolidate the existing foundation, and continue the current policy for society, guiding the financial sector onto a healthy track!</p>
<p>(A) Business Overview</p>
<p>(1) Deposits</p>
<p>A. Total Deposits The total outstanding balance of various deposits in the twenty-second year was 539,284,527.16, an increase of 62,736,473.73 compared to the twenty-first year. Analyzing the comparison: (1) The outstanding balance of current deposits was 189,769,090.68, an increase of 6,168,033.09 compared to the twenty-first year; (2) The outstanding balance of fixed deposits was 211,200,849.23, a decrease of 23,431,198.36 compared to the twenty-first year; this is because 56,884,670.47, the amount of guarantee reserve for issuance, was transferred out this year (see the section on the composition of the preparation for the issuance of banknotes below). If added to the calculation, it would be an increase of 33,453,472.11 compared to the twenty-first year; (3) The outstanding balance of interbank deposits was 138,314,587.25, an increase of 79,999,639.00 compared to the twenty-first year.</p>
<p>B. Number of Depositors The number of depositors in the twenty-second year was 136,729, an increase of 22,236 compared to the twenty-first year. If the number of 76,127 in the nineteenth year is taken as the base number, the index of the number of depositors increasing year by year can be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>Nineteenth year 100</p>
<p>Twentieth year 122</p>
<p>Twenty-first year 150</p>
<p>Twenty-second year 179</p>
<p>C. Nature of Deposits The percentages of various deposits in the twenty-second year, compared to the twenty-first year, according to the nature of the depositors, are as follows:</p>
<p>Year Government Deposits Industrial and Commercial Deposits Organizations and Individual Deposits</p>
<p>Twenty-first year 4.46 33.86 61.68</p>
<p>Twenty-second year 4.14 45.66 50.20</p>
<p>(2) Loans</p>
<p>A. Total Loans The total outstanding balance of various loans in the twenty-second year was 351,388,609.15, an increase of 28,497,391.33 compared to the twenty-first year. Analyzing the comparison: (1) The outstanding balance of current loans and overdrafts was 125,844,576.54, an increase of 26,427,228.61 compared to the twenty-first year; (2) The outstanding balance of fixed loans was 189,138,690.58, a decrease of 298,377.62 compared to the twenty-first year; (3) The outstanding balance of discounts and purchased term bills was 36,405,342.03, an increase of 2,368,540.34 compared to the twenty-first year.</p>
<p>B. Nature of Loans The percentages of loans in the twenty-second year, compared by type, are as follows:</p>
<p>Commerce 27.02, Industry 12.08, Agriculture and Agricultural Products 4.81, Interbank 6.56, Government Agencies 43.90, Public Utilities 0.97, Transportation 1.41, Organizations 0.73, Individuals 2.52, Total 100.00.</p>
<p>Before the twenty-first year, agricultural loans were included in the organization category, agricultural product loans were included in the commerce category, and transportation loans were included in the public utilities category. This year, in order to examine the bank's contribution to agricultural production and transportation construction, two categories were added for separate classification.</p>
<p>According to the bank's remittance statistics, the total amount of remittances received in the twenty-second year was 754,721,000 yuan, an increase of 2,506,000 yuan compared to the twenty-first year.</p>
<p>Analyzing the percentage of the bank's domestic remittances by region and comparing it with the twenty-first year can measure the increase or decrease in the flow rate of capital in various regions at home and abroad this year.</p>
<p>(3) Remittances</p>
<p>Region Percentage of Remittances Received in the Twenty-Second Year Percentage of Remittances Received in the Twenty-First Year</p>
<p>Yangtze River Basin 59.3 49.5</p>
<p>North China 17.7 22.1</p>
<p>Northeast China 10.0 6.5</p>
<p>South China 13.0 11.9</p>
<p>Furthermore, by examining the ratio of remittances in and out of treaty ports and inland towns, we can observe the trend that the centripetal force of national capital towards port cities is even stronger than last year.</p>
<p>Percentage of Remittances Sent Through the Bank Percentage of Remittances Received Through the Bank Excess of Port Inflows Over Outflows</p>
<p>Twenty-First Year Ports 36.1 34.27.3</p>
<p>Twenty-First Year Inland 63.9 66.627.3</p>
<p>Twenty-Second Year Ports 28.4 44.045.6</p>
<p>Twenty-Second Year Inland 71.6 56.645.6</p>
<p>What is even more noteworthy is that, taking Shanghai as an example, the total number of remittances received by the bank this year reached 437,730,000 yuan, accounting for 59.3% of the bank's total domestic remittances. Comparing this with the above ratio of excess port inflows over outflows of 45.6%, it can be seen that national remittances tend to flow towards ports, and port remittances are concentrated in Shanghai. This is the result of the inability of imports and exports to offset each other, and it is a sign of the depletion of capital in the interior.</p>
<p>(4) Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>The bank's foreign exchange business has always been compiled first according to US dollars and then converted into national currency at the current price for the convenience of calculation. If calculated in gold coins this year, the foreign exchange business has made considerable progress compared to the twenty-first year. However, due to the drop in the exchange rate of the US dollar, the number converted into national currency is smaller than last year, except for remittances and term bills.</p>
<p>(5) Revision of the Preparation Subject of Issuance of Exchange Notes and Loan and Loan Comparison Table</p>
<p>At the end of the twenty-second year, the total amount of exchange notes in circulation at the bank was 183,726,997.37, a decrease of 700,000 yuan compared to the total amount in circulation at the end of the twenty-first year. In terms of the reserve fund for exchange notes, the cash reserve was 115,863,202.90, accounting for 63% of the total amount in circulation; the guarantee reserve was 67,863,794.47, accounting for 37% of the total amount in circulation. According to the bank's previous externally published loan comparison table, the cash guarantee and the preparation submitted by the note-receiving firms were listed together as a whole preparation amount for the total amount in circulation. In addition to the cash and guarantee preparation of more than 60% of the firms, all of the bank's guarantee preparation was actually made up of valuable securities and real estate deeds, which have always been internally demarcated, recorded in separate accounts, and stored in separate warehouses. However, in the loan comparison table, this asset used as guarantee preparation was still included in the operating asset subject, and had not been separated. It was only listed again in the deposit item on the liability side to clarify the preparation and to seek a balance of assets and liabilities. With this method, there are shortcomings of repeated expression on the asset side, and there are many virtual transfer numbers on the asset side. This year, the past methods were revised, and all valuable securities of 49,828,199.70 and operating real estate of 7,056,470.77, which were used to fill the bank's guarantee preparation, are no longer listed separately under the operating asset and liability subject in the loan comparison table, so that the various asset and liability numbers published by the bank become more precise.</p>
<p>(6) Valuable Securities</p>
<p>At the end of the twenty-second year, the total amount of valuable securities at the bank was 81,847,045.91 (the guarantee preparation part was 49,828,199.70, and the operating part was 32,018,846.21), accounting for 8.9% of the total assets, an increase of 17,302,599.70 compared to 64,544,446.21 in the twenty-first year. Because fixed deposits have increased sharply, the increase is as above for the sake of decentralized use. At the same time, because the market price of British and American gold has fallen sharply in the twenty-second year, the gold bond component has been lowered to maintain the stability of property value. The percentages of the two types of gold and silver securities are listed on the left:</p>
<p>End of Twenty-Second Year End of Twenty-First Year</p>
<p>Silver Coin Securities 77.1 56.1</p>
<p>Gold Coin Securities 22.9 43.9</p>
<p>(7) Profit and Loss</p>
<p>A. Various Expenses The various expenses in the twenty-second year were more than 6,053,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 12,000 yuan compared to the twenty-first year. In the twenty-second year, the total volume of the bank's business increased compared to the previous year, but the total amount of expenses was still able to maintain the original state, which is the result of the bank's efforts to save money in the past year. It is hoped that the establishment of more institutions and the increase in business will continue to maintain the status quo in terms of expenses.</p>
<p>B. Profit Distribution The net profit in the twenty-second year was 1,923,975.14. After deducting one-tenth of the amount, which is 192,397.51, as public reserve fund according to the regulations, the remaining 1,731,577.63, plus the balance brought forward from the previous year of 4,816.65, less the 7% interest on official and commercial shares of 1,729,854.00, the remaining 6,540.28 is still listed under the profit carry-over item.</p>
<p>(B) Business Operations</p>
<p>In recent years, the circulation of funds in national urban ports has been slow, and it has been extremely difficult to find investment channels. It is even more difficult to consider both obtaining security from the bank's standpoint during the use of funds, and at the same time paying attention to assisting domestic production and alleviating economic panic. The bank's business operations this year have the following noteworthy aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Industrial Loans In the twenty-second year, domestic factories were affected by the decline of rural areas and the dumping of foreign goods, and there were frequent reports of closures and reduced work. Fortunately, the general industry is striving for survival, and its own has made considerable progress. The bank adheres to its long-standing policy of deep cooperation with the industrial sector and strives to assist. This year, the total amount of industrial loans reached 42,455,468 yuan, an increase of 4,020,045 yuan, or more than 10%, compared to last year; an increase of 11,247,814 yuan, or 36%, compared to the previous year. The components of various industries are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Cotton Mills 56.35</p>
<p>(2) Flour Mills 12.49</p>
<p>(3) Silk Mills 9.31</p>
<p>(4) Oil Mills 4.23</p>
<p>(5) Dyeing and Weaving Mills 3.48</p>
<p>(6) Egg Factories 2.78</p>
<p>(7) Food Factories 1.99</p>
<p>(8) Daily Necessities Factories 1.67</p>
<p>(9) Paper and Printing Factories 1.45</p>
<p>(10) Chemical Industry Factories 1.14</p>
<p>(11) Building Materials Factories 0.95</p>
<p>(12) Handicrafts 0.84</p>
<p>(13) Iron and Electrical Machinery Factories 0.71</p>
<p>(14) Rubber Factories 0.50</p>
<p>(15) Woolen Factories 0.45</p>
<p>(16) Tobacco Factories 0.40</p>
<p>(17) Other 1.26</p>
<p>Among the industrial loans mentioned in the above table, the yarn industry is the largest. Fortunately, the yarn factories assisted by the bank have been able to improve their work and revitalize their survival even in the midst of storms. In the future, it is planned to urge them to improve in terms of technology and management, and to cooperate with them in spirit in addition to economic strength, so that both the bank and the industry can benefit. (2) Agricultural Loans</p>
<p>(A) Agricultural Product Loans This year, we will use the bank's existing warehouse facilities in more than 80 locations to the greatest extent possible to mortgage agricultural products to seek the initial relief of stabilizing prices. At the end of the twenty-second year, agricultural product mortgages such as cotton, cocoons, rice, grains, tobacco, tea, etc. totaled more than 19.5 million yuan; cotton accounted for the largest proportion, with more than 8.19 million yuan; North China accounted for 70% of the morning, and the Yangtze River Basin accounted for 30%. The amount of cotton mortgaged is valued at approximately 11 million yuan. At the end of the twenty-second year, the market and factories had approximately 1.2 million dan of cotton in stock, valued at more than 50 million yuan, and the bank's mortgage component accounted for approximately one-fifth.</p>
<p>(B) Small Loans to Farmers In the second half of this year, 15 agricultural product warehouses were established in agricultural product distribution centers in various regions to promote small loans to farmers. The amount of the loan is not fixed, and some are only one yuan and a few corners. The interest is extremely low, not exceeding one point. At the end of this year, the approved loan quota was 1,012,600 yuan, and the actual loan was more than 622,000 yuan, with 14,597 households. (C) Cooperative Loans The bank will provide loans to cooperative societies that have been effectively managed to assist them. The most important ones are the Zouping Rural Improvement Association, the Dingxian Civilian Promotion Association, and the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee.</p>
<p>(3) Establishment of More Inland Institutions In order to seek the inward flow of capital, more institutions must be established in the interior. This year, 40 branches were added in locations with relatively stable local order, convenient transportation, and centers for the distribution of goods: 13 in Jiangsu Province, 4 in Zhejiang Province, 4 in Anhui Province, 1 in Hunan Province, 5 in Sichuan Province, 1 in Hebei Province, 4 in Henan Province, 2 in Shaanxi Province, 4 in Shandong Province, and 2 in Shanxi Province; 2 in Shanghai, 1 in Tianjin, and 1 in Shenyang, for a total of 44 additional institutions. Together with the old institutions, there are a total of 181 institutions. (4) Increase in Inland Lending and Reduction in Interest Rates Of the 28 million yuan of additional loans issued this year, only 35% of the loans were issued in ports, and approximately 65% of the loans were issued in the interior. As for the interest rate, it was reduced by 2-3% compared to previous years.</p>
<p>(5) Acceptance of Term Bills for Inland Products Merchants who purchase goods from the interior issue term bills that are cashed in major commercial ports and hand them over to the sellers. The sellers discount them at local money houses. In recent years, inland money houses have gradually closed down; even those who are still in business are either weak in capacity or find it difficult to transport cash, and are unwilling to actively accept term bills. Merchants do not dare to carry cash deep into the interior because of the unrest in the interior; therefore, agricultural products are slow to sell, and rural areas are suffering more and more. In view of this, the bank specially ordered its inland branches to do as much discounting and purchasing of term bills as possible. The outstanding balance of discounted and purchased term bills this year increased by more than 2.3 million yuan compared to the previous year; the total number accumulated throughout the year was 43,526,000 yuan, an increase of 10,944,300 yuan compared to the twenty-first year. This is one way to indirectly return capital to the interior. In the past, inland term bills were circulated by money houses; therefore, both the drawer and the seller were accustomed to the money house. The bank purchased the bills discounted by the money house, and the money house was responsible for them, without further research on their origin. Now that the bank directly accepts term bills, it has to deal with both the production and sales sides and be familiar with the actual situation of production and sales.</p>
<p>(6) Assisting in the Completion and Extension of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was completed at the end of the year to Yushan, with a total length of 355 kilometers. At present, the monthly passenger transport is approximately 100,500 people, and the freight transport is approximately 14,000 tons; compared with the length of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, the passenger transport is slightly more than one-sixth of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and the freight transport is also slightly more than one-sixth, while the expenditure accounts for slightly less than one-quarter of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. However, due to the economic downturn and the devastation of the communist bandits on the border of Jiangxi, the transportation of goods has not yet been developed. During the Fujian Incident this year, the military transport was fortunately not damaged in the slightest; even the military's travel expenses were issued according to the regulations. Now, the Ministry of Railways and the Jiangxi Provincial Government have decided to extend the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to carry out the construction of the Yushan-Pingxiang line, and the construction materials will require a total of 16 million yuan. The bank has agreed to undertake the planning in order to complete the starting point of the east-west trunk line south of the Yangtze River, which is necessary to restore the rural economy and improve the knowledge and living standards of farmers. The development of railways is the most urgent task.</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Problem of International Balance of Payments <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>China's annual trade deficits inevitably lead to a point where the shortfall cannot be offset, and the nation's purchasing power and inevitable international income will decline. This has been repeatedly warned to the people in previous reports. This year, the situation has begun to show signs of drying up. The decline in purchasing power can be seen in the significant reduction in this year's trade deficit. The inability to offset the trade deficit is evidenced by the outflow of silver. From the first year of the Republic of China to the twentieth year, except for the period of the European War in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years of the Republic of China, when there was a slight surplus, there was almost no year without an import surplus. This was because in previous years, there were intangible import surpluses to compensate. Last year, however, the total of gold and silver showed a greater outflow than inflow. Fortunately, there was a huge export of raw gold, and the import surplus of raw silver was still maintained. However, this year, despite the huge export of raw gold, raw silver actually saw an export surplus of more than 14 million yuan. This is a very rare fact in the history of trade. The export of goods and intangible income are not enough to offset international expenditures, and we are bound to use the savings of currency to offset the deficit. This is an extremely dangerous point in the national economy. Under these circumstances, can our people remain ignorant of the nation's international balance of payments and turn a blind eye to how to balance it?</p>
<p>Estimates of the International Balance of Payments for the Twenty-Second Year</p>
<p>Economists at home and abroad have made various guesses about China's international balance of payments, firstly, because accurate statistics of the figures are not available; secondly, because the balance between income and expenditure cannot be closely approximated. The research office of this bank has recently tried its best to be accurate and approximate within the possible scope from all aspects; however, how can it avoid the aforementioned shortcomings? Now, the estimated figures are described below, as a basis for studying the international balance of payments. This is to draw attention from all parties and provide more accurate data to obtain a complete international balance of payments table, which is also deeply hoped by those who care about the national economy.</p>
<p>1.  Value of exported goods: 611,800,000 yuan</p>
<p>2.  Underreporting of export values (the declared value of exported goods is generally underreported, conservatively estimated at one-tenth): 61,200,000 yuan</p>
<p>3.  Export of raw gold: 189,400,000 yuan</p>
<p>Officially declared exports: 69,400,000 yuan</p>
<p>Smuggled exports (exports from Hong Kong alone have reached 96 million yuan): 120,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>4.  Export of raw silver: 14,200,000 yuan</p>
<p>5.  Overseas Chinese remittances (reduced by more than one-third this year): 200,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>6.  Expenditures of foreigners traveling in China: 10,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>7.  Church expenses and charitable donations: 50,000,000 yuan</p>

<p>Customs-guaranteed debt: 75,600,000 yuan</p>
<p>Salt tax-guaranteed debt: 11,400,000 yuan</p>
<p>Railway-guaranteed debt: 6,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>4.  Foreign businesses' operating profits (foreign businesses' operations have greatly declined in recent years, and insurance operations are also relatively sluggish, conservatively estimated as follows): 24,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>5.  Expenditures of embassies and consulates abroad and study abroad expenses: 6,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>6.  Remittances of funds from foreigners in China: 1,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>7.  Foreign film rentals: 5,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total international expenditures: 1,609,200,000 yuan</p>
<p>According to the above estimated figures, the expenditure is about 160,920,000 yuan, and the income is about 132,660,000 yuan, with a difference of about 28,260,000 yuan. How to compensate for this difference is impossible to prove the source, and we dare not arbitrarily guess. Some say that Chinese people's transactions on the New York Stock Exchange have earned tens of millions, and some say that the deposit of foreign banks in Shanghai has increased by about 90 million yuan, a large part of which is funds that should be remitted but have not been remitted, which also compensates for part of the difference, but we dare not take them as proper data. However, according to the above figures, we can know that the actual income is far less than the actual expenditure, and the large amount of income regarded as a fixed source of overseas Chinese remittances is decreasing day by day. Therefore, the export of raw gold is not enough to make up for the expenditure, and we have to use raw silver to make up for it. This is the most significant phenomenon in the international balance of payments in the 22nd year. Judging from this year to predict next year, the national economy is not far from bankruptcy!</p>
<p>Silver Price Problem</p>
<p>Observing the situation this year, the trend of import surplus is not easy to change, then the increase in the export of silver is inevitable. If the price of silver increases day by day; at the same time, or the price of silver in New York is higher than the exchange value of silver, the rate of increase in exports will be even greater. The rise and fall of silver prices in the past only affected commodity prices; and in the future, the price of silver, due to the relationship of the international balance of payments, will further affect China's silver reserves. The export surplus of raw silver in China seems to have started this year, but in fact, in recent years, there has been no year without an export surplus of raw silver; because Shanghai is almost equal to foreign countries; the difference between the foreign dollars imported into Shanghai and exported abroad is only one step. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Shanghai's deposit increased by 50 million yuan, in the 21st year, it increased by 126 million yuan, and in the 22nd year, it increased by 109 million yuan; but the import surplus of raw silver was only 45 million yuan in the 20th year, and only 24 million yuan in the 21st year, and the situation in Hong Kong is similar; because the foreign dollars imported into the mainland Shanghai is like preparing to export abroad as the first step. As a result of the concentration of foreign dollars in the mainland commercial ports, currency and credit are shrinking at the same time; resulting in a tragic fall in commodity prices and the decline of the countryside, due to the fall in commodity prices in the mainland. The purchasing power of the people is reduced, and Shanghai's industry and commerce have plummeted; if Shanghai's silver flows out again, then Shanghai's currency and credit will shrink accordingly, and the value of movable and immovable property will fall at the same time; then the silver stored in Shanghai can be changed at any time; that is, the phenomenon that has occurred in the mainland will inevitably reappear in the commercial ports; and the foundation of the national economy is in danger of shaking. If foreign countries take artificial methods again, formulate laws and regulations, and raise the price of silver, it will further promote the export of raw silver. Taking the first half of this year as an example; when preparing for the London Economic Conference, the price of silver rose from 16.5 pence to 20.5 pence, and China purely exported more than 34 million yuan of raw silver; until the price of silver fell back in the second half of the year, there was a slight import, which is one proof. Therefore, for the sake of China, we sincerely hope that all countries will continue the original purpose of stabilizing the price of silver at the London Economic Conference; and we dare not agree with the policy of artificially raising the price excessively. As for saying that raising the price of silver can increase the purchasing power of the Chinese people, I do not know that the purchasing power of the Chinese people has been forced to decline due to the failure to balance the international balance of payments, the contraction of the mainland currency, and the fall in commodity prices. Unless world commodity prices rise and China's exports increase, the purchasing power of the people cannot be restored. The level of the price of silver is already not important. Moreover, all countries have adopted a policy of devaluation and dumping, and if the price of silver is too high, the national goods industry will be greatly affected, which China cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Foreign Credit</p>
<p>The huge difference in the international balance of payments, the remedy is nothing more than increasing production; if you want to increase production, you must have funds for improvement and construction, if you do not import foreign capital and obtain foreign credit, the expenditure to foreign countries will be even greater. Even according to the current trend, without the assistance of foreign credit, it is impossible to maintain the existing purchasing power. However, the acquisition of foreign funds and credit depends on the ability of foreign countries to export capital; and it depends on China's own credit. The thickness of China's own credit depends on the stability of politics and the consolidation of foreign debts. This year, the political situation has become slightly more stable; therefore, the various foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties have all increased, such as the Post-Rehabilitation Bonds, which rose from £73 in January to £90 5 shillings in December; although there is no large-scale plan for railway debts; Fortunately, the old habit of the military requisitioning road funds has been terminated, and various roads can use their remaining strength to consolidate debts, such as the Sino-British company loans of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Beijing-Shanghai railways, which stipulate that a certain amount should be repaid monthly, and they have been able to fulfill the plan in the past year; the Fu Company loan of the Daoging Railway has been used to repay the principal and interest monthly; the Beiluo Railway's Big Company loan has paid interest once, the Big Company's part of the continued loan has paid interest once in 28 installments; and the Big Company's part of the original loan has been paid part of the interest in 33 installments; At the same time, the Pinghan British material debt is paid 50,000 yuan per month; the Jinpu British material debt is also paid 50,000 yuan per month; and the Pingui Road's American material debt is paid 5,000 US dollars per month. Although the above are very small amounts; however, it is also the first step to take care of credit. Therefore, this year, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo bond rose from 84 to more than 90% ; Beijing-Shanghai rose from 41 to 54. If the government can have a comprehensive plan for the consolidation of railway foreign debts; then the credit of railway bonds will not be difficult to increase; China's foreign credit will increase, and the inflow of foreign capital will be easy. This cannot but hope that the government will make further plans. As for the administrative management of state-owned railways in one year this year, there have been improvements, not only are merchants and people benefiting from convenient transportation; it is also of great benefit to the railway's foreign credit!</p>
<h3 id="e179">Rural Relief <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Reasons for Rural Decline</p>
<p>In a country where 70-80% of the people are engaged in agriculture, and the rural areas have declined to this extreme, the impact on the national economy is extremely significant; therefore, rural relief is a major problem in the 22nd year, and it has a deep relationship with the financial community. The reasons for the decline of the rural areas are listed in order;</p>
<p>1.  The tragic fall in agricultural product prices. The average price of wheat in Jinan, Shandong in the 20th year was 5 yuan 28 cents per dan, and the average price in the 22nd year was 4 yuan 32 cents; the price of rice in Wuhu was 9 yuan 11 cents on average in the 21st year, and 6 yuan 17 cents in the 22nd year; the market price of peanuts in Qingdao fell from the average price of 13 yuan per dan in the 21st year to 9 yuan 50 cents in the 22nd year; the tobacco leaves in Qingzhou, Shandong, were worth 16 yuan 50 cents per dan on average in the 21st year, and only 9 yuan in the 22nd year. According to the wholesale prices in Shanghai investigated by the Tariff Commission, the price of rice in the 22nd year was 55% of that in the 20th year and 81% of that in the 21st year; the price of wheat in the 22nd year was 76% of that in the 20th year and 80% of that in the 21st year; the price of tea in the 22nd year was 43% of that in the 20th year and 59% of that in the 21st year; the price of cocoons in the 22nd year fell 43% compared to the 20th year; the price of peanuts in the 22nd year fell 40% compared to the 20th year and 20% compared to the 21st year; the price of cotton fell the least, and the market price in the 22nd year was 8</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>1% of that in the 20th year and 87% of that in the 21st year. At the same time, the prices of farmers' necessities fell less than the prices of agricultural products. For example, the average price of cotton yarn in the 22nd year fell 24% compared to the 20th year and 9% compared to the 21st year; the price of coarse cloth in the 22nd year fell only 2% compared to the 21st year. According to this calculation, if you exchange a bag of cotton yarn for agricultural products, you only need 19 dan of white rice in the 20th year of the Republic of China; 83 catties of black tea; 142 catties of dried cocoons; 24 dan of peanuts; in the 21st year, you need 23 dan of white rice; 100 catties of black tea; 200 catties of dried cocoons; 27 dan of peanuts; in the 22nd year, you need 26 dan of white rice; 153 catties of black tea; 178 catties of dried cocoons; 31 dan of peanuts. Due to the fall in the price of agricultural products, farmers cannot make ends meet; according to the survey of the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute in Jiangning County; in the 22nd year, the average consumption expenditure of each adult farmer was 52 yuan, and the agricultural income was only 42 yuan, and the amount of income not enough to cover the expenditure was as high as 10 yuan; that is, the amount of income was only 80% of the expenditure.</p>
<p>2.  The burden of farmers has increased without decreasing. According to the report of 687 counties of the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute; the tax burden of farmers is still increasing. The total of all provinces; the tax rate of paddy fields was 2.07% of the field price in the 20th year, 2.37% in the 21st year, and 2.68% in the 22nd year, that is, the burden in the 22nd year increased by about 30% compared with the 20th year; the tax rate of dry land was 2.36% of the field price in the 20th year, 2.50% in the 21st year, and 2.80% in the 22nd year, that is, the 22nd year increased by about 20% compared with the 20th year. The landlord's rental income and its burden in Jiangsu Province were examined. In the 20th year, the rental income was 9 yuan, the field tax expenditure was 1 yuan 30 cents, and the remaining amount was 7 yuan 70 cents; in the 21st year, the rental income was 7 yuan 80 cents, the field tax expenditure was 1 yuan 70 cents, and the remaining amount was 6 yuan 10 cents; in the 22nd year, the rental income was 7 yuan 40 cents, the field tax expenditure was 2 yuan 70 cents, and the remaining amount was 4 yuan 70 cents; therefore, landlords invested in buying fields, and in the 20th year, they got a weekly interest of 7.7%; in the 21st year, they got 6.1%; and in the 22nd year, they only got 4.7%.</p>
<p>3.  The repercussions of the fall in the price of foreign agricultural products. Although the import quantity of foreign agricultural products in the 22nd year was slightly less than that in the 21st year; however, its low price not only threatened the price of Chinese agricultural products at all times, making it impossible to rise; the quantity imported into China has indirectly overwhelmed Chinese agricultural products. The US cotton and wheat loans also have a great impact on the price of cotton and wheat in China.</p>
<p>4.  The lack of abundant agricultural harvests. China's agricultural harvests are not abundant, firstly because the area of arable land is not large; secondly because of the degradation of production methods. The total arable land in the country is 1,462,682 square li; but the arable land is only 322,443 square li, accounting for 22%. The harvest of foreign wheat is abundant, with each hectare counting as 100 kilos, Canada is 10.9; the United States is 9.9; Australia is 7.4; China is 7.3. The harvest of rice is 34.2 in Japan; 46.4 in Italy; 22.9 in Taiwan; and 18.9 in China (the above are the averages from 1928 to 1931). In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the harvest of grain was 1,558,000,000 dan, in the 21st year it was 1,698,000,000 dan, and in the 22nd year it was 1,586,000,000 dan; that is, it only increased by 2% compared to the previous year, and it was 6% less than last year; the cotton output in the 22nd year was 20% more than in the 20th year and 35% more than in the 21st year; but the reason for the increase in output was due to the increase in the planting area. Not an increase in production.</p>
<p>Due to the decline of the rural areas, the value of agricultural land is declining day by day. In total, the price of paddy fields fell by 6% last year compared to the previous year, and this year it fell by 12% compared to the previous year; the price of dry land fell by 7% last year and 11% this year. Therefore, the land in the north that used to be worth 150 yuan per mu is now depreciated to 30 or 40 yuan, and no one cares about it; the south has also fallen by almost half the price, and there is still no owner; causing it extremely difficult for farmers to mortgage their land for cash. In the past, the heavy interest burden of farmers' loans was criticized by the world, but today, even with heavy interest, it is difficult to borrow cash.</p>
<p>Relief Measures</p>
<p>Knowing the reasons for the decline of the rural areas, it is nothing more than that the operating costs of farmers are high and the value obtained is low; that is, knowing that to relieve the rural areas, on the one hand, we must reduce agricultural costs; on the other hand, we must increase the prices of agricultural products.</p>
<p>This year, the government and society have taken measures to reduce agricultural costs and increase agricultural product prices;</p>
<p>1.  The government issued a general order to abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes; but various provinces have not yet taken concrete actions to reduce or abolish them.</p>
<p>2.  Financial institutions advocated loans to farmers; various banks either set up agricultural warehouses to try out small loans; or advocated indirect loans from cooperatives; but the total amount was less than six or seven million yuan. The interest rate was reduced to between 1% and 8%.</p>
<p>3.  The government levied import taxes on foreign rice at one gold unit per dan, which is equivalent to 1 yuan 95 cents in foreign currency; the import tax on foreign wheat is 0.30 gold units per dan, which is equivalent to 59 cents in foreign currency; the import tax on foreign flour is 0.75 gold units per dan, which is equivalent to 1 yuan 47 cents in foreign currency; however, Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujian, where foreign rice is imported the most, have not yet implemented the levy. 4. Financial institutions added warehouses to increase agricultural product pledges.</p>
<p>As for the central and provincial agencies that handle agricultural improvement, the number is as follows;</p>
<p>Administration and Design 46</p>
<p>Experimentation and Research 161</p>
<p>Promotion 307</p>
<p>Agricultural Finance 58</p>
<p>However, the various agencies run are all limited by limited funds, narrow scale, limited strength, and slow progress. In addition, the increase in the number of cooperatives is worth mentioning. The types are listed in the table as follows;</p>
<p>Approximate Number of Cooperatives Increased in the Past Two Years</p>

<p>1933 117,264 2,890 1,824 24,573 Unknown 766 368 912,919</p>
<p>(According to Ge Zhicheng's "General Survey of the Country's Cooperatives in the 22nd Year," Cooperative Monthly, January 15, 23rd year, Volume 6, Issue 1.)</p>
<p>The governments of all countries are using all their national strength to relieve agriculture by various methods; and the decline of China's rural areas has reached this extreme, and the relief measures are only as described above. For the future of the national economy, we cannot but be deeply worried; that is, like a weak body, we must apply heavy tonics, and empty talk about hygiene and minor medicines cannot bring the dead back to life. If the central and local governments can jointly raise tens of millions of huge funds, and have a cooperative organization; at the same time, consolidating the field tax and surtax, and moderately reducing it, may be able to gradually save it. Our sad and painful Manchuria, the so-called central bank, is still using 12 million yuan to provide low-interest loans to support spring plowing, one yuan per mu. How can China's size be saved by hundreds of millions of yuan? As for commercial financial institutions, although it is not impossible to slightly fulfill the responsibility of promoting; however, after all, it cannot be completely guaranteed by land and credit to save the most urgent and poorest farmers; therefore, thorough relief will not be successful without the government's actual subsidy. On the social side, we can only urgently cultivate personnel who serve rural work and encourage young people who have already received considerable education to engage in rural work. We in the financial community hope that the banks will continue their existing work, promote the popularization of cooperatives, and assist in improving transportation and sales, which is also fulfilling their share of responsibility!</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Agricultural Production and Import of Agricultural Products in the 22nd Year <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>According to various statistics on the grain harvest of the 22nd year of the Republic, the national average total was 6% less than in the 21st year, but 2% more than in the 20th year. Specifically: In the Northwest region, namely the five provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, and Shaanxi, the wheat harvest was 25% less than in the 20th year and 9% less than in the 21st year; the coarse grains harvest was 10% more than in the 20th year and 8% more than in the 21st year. Combined, the total was 5% less than in the 20th year. In the Northern region, namely the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, the wheat harvest was 11% more than in the 20th year and 10% more than in the 21st year; the coarse grains harvest was 3% less than in the 20th year and 8% less than in the 21st year; the sweet potato harvest was 36% more than in the 20th year and 20% more than in the 21st year. Combined, the total was 3% more than in the 20th year and 1% less than in the 21st year. In the Central region, namely the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, the wheat harvest was 4% less than in the 20th year and 10% less than in the 21st year; the rice harvest was 4% more than in the 20th year and 11% less than in the 21st year; the coarse grains and sweet potato harvest was 40% more than during the floods of the 20th year and 6% less than in the 21st year. Combined, the total grain harvest was 4% more than the flood year and 13% less than last year. In the Eastern region, namely the three provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, the wheat harvest was 11% less than the year before; the rice harvest was 26% more than in the 20th year and 3% more than in the 21st year; the sweet potato harvest also increased. Combined, the total was 30% more than in the 20th year and 1% more than in the 21st year. In the Southwest region, namely the three provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, the wheat harvest was 4% less than in the 20th year and 11% less than in the 21st year; the rice harvest was 10% less than in the 20th year and 10% less than in the 21st year; the coarse grains and sweet potato harvest was 9% less than in the 20th year and 13% more than in the 21st year. Combined, the total was 9% less than in the 20th year and 17% less than in the 21st year. In the Southeast region, namely the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, the rice harvest was 5% less than in the 20th year and 6% less than in the 21st year; the sweet potatoes and wheat harvest was similar to the previous two years. Combined, the total was 3% less than in the 20th year and 5% less than in the 21st year.</p>
<p>Cotton: In the 22nd year, the national cotton crop benefited from favorable rainfall during planting and suitable weather during germination, resulting in vigorous growth. Furthermore, stability gradually returned to the northern provinces, leading to increased cotton acreage and production, particularly in Shanxi and Hubei. Minor damage was limited to small areas along the Yellow River in Shandong and the Yangtze River in Hubei, as well as the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which experienced some wind and rain damage. According to a survey by the China Cotton Association, the national cotton acreage totaled 40,453,953 mu, an increase of 8,816,174 mu compared to the 20th year and 3,354,153 mu compared to the 21st year, representing increases of 28% and 9%, respectively. The national cotton production amounted to 9,621,240 dan, an increase of 3,221,460 dan compared to the 20th year and 1,515,603 dan compared to the 21st year, representing increases of 50% and 19%, respectively. The significant increase in production was the largest since the 8th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Tea: The most prominent tea-producing regions include the provinces of Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, and Zhejiang. In recent years, due to factors such as decreased sales and frequent banditry, tea production has significantly declined. Accurate statistics on China's tea planting area and tea production are unavailable. However, according to a rough estimate by the Ministry of Industry, the tea planting area is around 3 million mu, and the tea production is between 4 million and 5 million dan. It can be confidently stated that both the tea planting area and production are declining year by year. According to customs reports, the export value was over 51.8 million yuan in the 20th year, over 38.5 million yuan in the 21st year, and only over 34.2 million yuan in the 22nd year.</p>
<p>Tobacco: According to surveys, this year's tobacco production increased by 25% compared to the 21st year, amounting to approximately 1.04 million dan. Shandong had the highest production, reaching 470,000 dan, an increase of 40,000 dan compared to last year. The tobacco-producing areas of the province experienced favorable rainfall, resulting in plump and large tobacco leaves, with a yield of 250 jin per mu. The planted acreage in Henan and Anhui also increased, and the tobacco varieties were also good. However, the price dropped sharply, causing hardship for the villagers. Silkworm Cocoons: In the 22nd year, the spring silkworm cocoon production was approximately 110,000 dan, the summer cocoon production was approximately 30,000 dan, and the autumn cocoon production was approximately 40,000 dan, totaling 180,000 dan, which was an increase compared to the 21st year.</p>
<p>Peanuts: According to estimates by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry, this year's peanut production was 170,000 dan in Shanxi, 6,350,000 dan in Hebei, 13,760,000 dan in Shandong, and 4,820,000 dan in Henan, totaling 25,100,000 dan.</p>
<p>Vegetable Oil: This year's soybean oil exports were nearly zero (because the customs of the three northeastern provinces are not counted). The export value in the 21st year had already decreased by two-thirds compared to the 20th year, but there were still more than 460,000 dan, worth more than 7.48 million yuan. In the 22nd year, the export amount was only one dan, worth 23 yuan. However, the export volume of tung oil slightly increased compared to the 21st year, amounting to 1,246,847 dan, totaling 30,261,269 yuan. The export volume in the previous year was 802,769 dan, worth 23,316,233 yuan.</p>
<p>Import of Agricultural Products: Despite the abundant agricultural harvest in the 22nd year, the import of agricultural products still reached a substantial 400 million yuan. The largest category was rice, amounting to 150 million yuan, only a decrease of 35 million yuan compared to the 21st year. Cotton amounted to 98 million yuan, a decrease of 87 million yuan compared to the 21st year. Wheat amounted to 87 million yuan, a decrease of 3 million yuan compared to the 21st year. Flour amounted to 27 million yuan, a decrease of half compared to the 21st year. Tobacco amounted to 26 million yuan, a decrease of 10 million yuan compared to the 21st year. Sugar amounted to 42 million yuan, a decrease of 30 million yuan compared to the 21st year. However, due to the increase in import tariffs last year, the amount of smuggled imports was also not small. The comparison of the import value of agricultural products and the total import value in the past three years is as follows:</p>
<p>Year Import Export Total Trade Deficit</p>
<p>18th Year 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0</p>
<p>19th Year 103.5 88.1 96.6 166.9</p>
<p>20th Year 113.2 89.5 102.7 209.5</p>
<p>21st Year 82.0 94.8 86.7 222.6</p>
<p>22nd Year 68.2 38.7 55.1 188.3</p>
<p>The only countries with increased imports were Australia and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was the largest dumper of tobacco and oil, while Australia was the major importer of wheat and flour. With regard to exports, the future of trade with the United States is promising. Steel, machinery, vehicles, timber, etc., will inevitably increase year by year due to China's construction needs and the low exchange rate of the US dollar. Before China increases the production of improved cotton varieties, the raw materials for fine cotton yarn will still have to rely on the United States. Therefore, the situation of trade deficit will inevitably continue. The only way to make up for this trade deficit is to increase the export of tung oil, raw silk, and fur, and to find ways to promote the export of other agricultural products.</p>

<p>Whether China's agricultural products are sufficient for self-sufficiency cannot be determined with accurate statistics. However, considering the situation of rice reserves in the mainland, it cannot be said that it is not self-sufficient. Only by ensuring average distribution and improving marketing can the supply of rice in various regions be increased. Moreover, the provinces that import large quantities of foreign rice are only Fujian and Guangdong. If the rice-producing provinces along the Yangtze River can establish an improved</p>
<p>marketing system with Fujian and Guangdong, reducing transportation costs, and with the support of the government's strength, it will not be difficult to achieve results. Currently, cotton production is indeed insufficient to meet the needs of various yarn factories, especially the insufficient production of fine cotton yarn, requiring the import of about 300,000 bales of foreign cotton each year. However, fine American cotton can be produced in western Henan, eastern Qi, and central Shaanxi. If the government fully encourages this, production can be increased year by year, and the import of foreign cotton will naturally decrease. As for wheat and flour, China's production can still be self-sufficient, and only by improving marketing can factories avoid purchasing foreign wheat. The most difficult thing is sugar, because the import of foreign sugar has resulted in a daily decrease in the planting of sugar raw materials such as sugarcane and beets. Now, promoting sugar production must start with promoting the planting of raw materials. One thing must be said: if China wants to curb the increase in imports of agricultural products, it must seek fundamental improvements in agriculture. However, superficial solutions should not be abandoned. I believe that increasing import tariffs is an effective way to promote agricultural self-sufficiency at present. For example, after Jiangsu and Zhejiang increased the import tax on foreign rice in the 22nd year, the import of foreign rice greatly decreased. If the import tariff rate can be improved simultaneously with the improvement of production and marketing, gradually increasing it, then domestic production can be self-sufficient. The import tariff rate for wheat and flour is only 0.30 gold units per dan, equivalent to 0.586 yuan, which is far from the 2.25 yuan per dan of wheat levied by Japan. If the import tax on wheat is increased to one gold unit and flour is increased to 1.50 gold units, it will not be far from the Japanese tax rate. Because China can produce enough wheat and flour, a slight increase in tax rate will not greatly affect the people's food. Although cotton cannot be self-sufficient, if a considerable import tax can be levied, the price of Chinese cotton will increase, and farmers will naturally increase planting cotton. Even if the price of fine yarn is worried about being raised due to taxation, reducing the consumption of fine yarn may also be a way to encourage thrift. Therefore, in order to save the rural decline and promote agricultural self-sufficiency, it is hoped that the government will give careful consideration to the import tariff on agricultural products. Even for friendly countries that have trade relations with China, only by China's early recovery of agriculture can the purchasing power of the Chinese people be improved, which they should also sympathize with.</p>

<p>In the 22nd year, the import trade volume was over 134.5 million yuan, and the export trade volume was over 61.1 million yuan, totaling over 195.7 million yuan. The trade deficit was over 73.3 million yuan. Compared with the 21st year, imports decreased by 18%, exports decreased by 20%, and the trade deficit also decreased by 15%. Taking the 18th year as the standard, the annual decline index is as follows: (taking the 18th year as 100)</p>
<p>The increase was in the United States, Hong Kong, and Annam. The increase in the United States was due to the strong sales of tung oil and wool; the increase in Hong Kong was due to the increased transshipment of mineral sand and raw silk; the increase in Annam was only several tens of thousands of yuan. The index compared with the 21st year is as follows: (taking the 21st year as 100)</p>
<p>Country Import Export</p>
<p>United States 71 121</p>
<p>United Kingdom 83 83</p>

<p>France 98 91</p>
<p>Soviet Russia 157 16</p>
<p>Korea 25 57</p>
<p>In the 22nd year, the countries that had the main trade relations with China were the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, which are described below:</p>
<p>United States: In recent years, due to good international relations and convenient transportation, the United States has been able to maintain its superior position in trade with China. In the 22nd year, the import volume decreased significantly, from 41,937,500 yuan to 29,746,800 yuan, accounting for 21.86% of China's total import value, a decrease of 3.57% compared to the 21st year. What China relies on the United States for are cotton, flour, tobacco, kerosene, gasoline, and timber, most of which are raw materials. Although Soviet Russian oil competes with kerosene and gasoline, it has not decreased and still ranks first in imports, amounting to over 75.9 million yuan. Due to China's abundant cotton production and decreased sales of cotton yarn, cotton decreased from over 15.6 million yuan last year to over 6.65 million yuan. Due to China's abundant tobacco harvest and increased unified tax on cigarettes, cigarette factories tend to use low-priced Chinese raw materials, which decreased from over 36 million yuan last year to over 26 million yuan. The price of American flour cannot compete with Australia, so the import of American wheat is almost extinct. Flour decreased from over 34 million yuan last year to over 11 million yuan. Timber slightly increased. In addition, airplanes and vehicles increased significantly. The main goods that China imports from the United States are tung oil, and exports increased from over 14 million yuan last year to over 21 million yuan. Hide and skin increased from over 14 million yuan last year to over 20 million yuan. Wool increased the most significantly, from over 1.7 million yuan last year to over 11 million yuan this year. China's trade with the United States: imports were 29,746,800 yuan; exports were 11,314,600 yuan, a difference of 18,432,200 yuan. Observation in China</p>
<p>United Kingdom: As a result of excluding Japanese goods, British import trade jumped from third to second place. This year's imports decreased from 18,570,000 yuan to 15,400,000 yuan, a decrease of 17% compared to last year, accounting for 11.33% of China's total import value, with little difference from last year. The main imports are hardware, cotton cloth, machinery, wool fabric, yarn, and ammonium sulfate. Due to the competition of Japanese goods, the progress of China's domestic industry, and the increase of Chinese tax rates, the import of cotton cloth decreased from more than 36 million yuan last year to more than 19 million yuan. Hardware increased from more than 22 million yuan to more than 29 million yuan due to the increase of railway construction and the need for materials for domestic industry. Machinery and tools decreased by more than 3 million yuan due to the decline of the market and the lack of expansion of various industries. Wool fabrics and yarn slightly decreased, with little change. Ammonium sulfate also decreased. The main goods that China exports to the United Kingdom are eggs, tea, bristles, alpaca wool, straw hats, tung oil, and wool carpets. Eggs decreased from more than 24.5 million yuan last year to more than 21.9 million yuan, a decrease of 11%. Tea decreased from 4.57 million yuan to 3.84 million yuan. Pig bristles decreased from 2.96 million yuan to 2.51 million yuan. Straw hats and wool carpets slightly increased. From the above, we can know that China's exports to the United Kingdom are very small. The export value decreased from 58.5 million yuan last year to 48.76 million yuan, with a trade deficit of more than 10.527 million yuan. With the progress of China's construction and the increase in railway construction, the reliance on the United Kingdom for hardware, machinery, and railway materials will inevitably increase day by day, while there are few goods that China can supply to the United Kingdom. This is a problem that Chinese and British people should study.</p>
<p>Japan: Japan's trade with China has greatly decreased due to the impact of excluding Japanese goods and the exclusion of trade volume in the Northeast. Imports were 13.2 million yuan, accounting for 9.71% of the total import value, a decrease of more than 98.8 million yuan compared to the 21st year, a decrease of 42.8%. The main imports were cotton textiles, sugar, various machines, chemical products, seafood, metal products, paper, coal, and rubber products. Exports decreased from 16,746,000 yuan last year to 9,580,000 yuan. The share of China's total exports decreased from 21.80% to 15.65%. The main exports were cotton, followed by cotton yarn, mostly exported by Japanese factories in China, accounting for more than 13 million yuan; bran accounted for more than 5.9 million yuan; kernels accounted for more than 8.16 million yuan; seed cake and miscellaneous grain products accounted for more than 4.79 million yuan; accounted for more than 4.12 million yuan; the rest were metal ore, pig bristles, frozen meat, hides, etc., which were very small. However, if Japan's trade with China includes the Northeast, it will increase greatly. What Japan has lost in China has been recovered in the Northeast, and what China has lost can no longer be recovered! Japan's import trade deficit is more than 36 million yuan. Although the current trade deficit does not seem to be large, Japanese goods are being dumped at low prices this year, which has gradually taken effect. It is feared that the trade deficit next year will be greater than this year's.</p>
<p>In addition, other places that are more related are Hong Kong, Australia, Germany, India, etc. In addition to its own trade, Hong Kong is also a place for China to transfer trade with other countries. The value of goods imported from Hong Kong to China was 48.28 million yuan; the value of goods imported from China to Hong Kong was 120.95 million yuan. Therefore, the value of goods imported from China to Hong Kong ranks first in China's exports, accounting for 19.75% of the total export value. The main commodities were mineral sand, tin ingots, etc., worth more than 20 million yuan, silk fabrics and cloth worth more than 12 million yuan, which is the result of the progress of domestic industry; poultry and livestock worth more than 7.9 million yuan; medicinal materials and fragrant villages worth 7 million yuan; cotton yarn worth 4.7 million yuan; embroidered goods worth 4.3 million yuan; fruits worth 1.6 million yuan; peanut oil worth 2.7 million yuan; tung oil worth 2.6 million yuan; In addition, peanuts, seafood, fresh eggs, tea, paper, etc., totaled more than 59 million yuan. The main commodities imported from Hong Kong were sugar worth more than 9.3 million yuan; fish and seafood worth 6.8 million yuan; medicinal materials and fragrant materials worth 4.3 million yuan; others were sandalwood, rice, pigments, books, wool fabrics, etc., more than 100 kinds, worth 72 million yuan in total. Therefore, Hong Kong trade has a value of attention in China's trade, and it is necessary to maintain good relations. Australian wheat accounts for 80% of imported foreign wheat. Its import value increased from 63.5 million yuan last year to 85.7 million yuan. The value of German imports has been increasing year by year. On the Indian side, exports slightly increased.</p>
<p>In summary, 80 to 90 percent of China's exports are agricultural products. To reduce the trade deficit, it is necessary to reduce the export of agricultural products and increase the export of agricultural products. The export volume of agricultural products in the past three years and their value are as follows:</p>
<p>Year Total Value of Main Agricultural Exports</p>
<p>Republic of China 20th Year 421,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic of China 21st Year X 253,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Republic of China 22nd Year X 241,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>X The 21st year of the Republic of China only includes the figures from January to June in the Northeast ports, and the figures in the 22nd year of the Republic of China do not include the figures in the Northeast ports at all.</p>
<p>The total value of main agricultural exports has been decreasing year by year in the past three years. One is the elimination of bulk agricultural products in the Northeast; the second is the global recession, and countries have increased taxes to restrict imports; and the third is the low market price, and the sales and sales value of China's agricultural products are decreasing day by day. Under this situation, to increase the export of agricultural products, in terms of fundamental solutions, it is necessary to improve quality, unify types, and reduce costs. In terms of superficial solutions, the main exported agricultural products should be exempt from export taxes. It is true that this kind of export tax is unique in the world. The government should pay attention to the national economy and should not care about these tens of millions of yuan of income.</p>
<h3 id="e182">The State of Industry in the Twenty-Second Year <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Among China's industries that developed relatively early and on a broader scale, the most prominent were cotton mills, flour mills, and silk factories. Next were the cigarette and match industries. The emerging industries with a smaller scope were daily necessities. The progress of flour mills has reached a considerable limit, while cotton mills have expanded annually. However, due to the weak purchasing power of the people and narrow sales channels, cotton and flour mills that are not managed effectively are facing losses. The silk industry is struggling to survive due to falling silk prices. The cigarette and match industries face fierce competition and high consolidated taxes. Except for a few firmly established businesses, most find it difficult to profit. As for the emerging daily necessities industry, which was in the autumn of development and growth, it showed signs of difficulty and decline last year. This was due to the impact of the January 28th Incident and the decline of rural areas. Therefore, from the perspective of the entire industry, the twenty-second year can be considered the beginning of a difficult period for the industrial sector. Regionally, factories in the interior, close to raw material production areas and consumer markets, have lower costs than those in treaty ports. Thus, the cotton and flour mills in the interior performed better than those in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou this year. However, Chinese industries in both the interior and concession areas are constantly threatened by the competition from foreign factories established in China and the dumping of similar imported foreign goods. This is a persistent concern for those engaged in industrial management.</p>
<p>Textile Industry</p>
<p>The sharp decline in cotton yarn prices in the twenty-second year was unprecedented in the last decade. In the twenty-first year, the lowest price of standard yarn was 193 yuan, while in the current year, it was 166 yuan. This year, the sales volume of Shanghai merchant guilds was only 70% of the twenty-first year and less than half of the twentieth year. Compared with the nineteenth year before the disasters, sales in the South and the Yangtze River region decreased by half, while in the North, they decreased by only one-fiftieth. According to the statistics in March of the twenty-second year, the total number of yarn spindles in the country was 5,019,917, an increase of 322,637 compared to last year and 575,617 compared to the year before. Under these circumstances, each had to seek survival. Consequently, foreign cotton mills competed with Chinese cotton mills, interior cotton mills competed with treaty port cotton mills, and northern cotton mills competed with southern cotton mills. The more intense the competition, the more difficult the survival. Generally speaking, most cotton mills across the country suffered losses, with even those making a slight profit faring much worse than last year. Comparing Japanese cotton mills with Chinese cotton mills, the cost of Japanese yarn decreased more and more, and the quality of products improved daily. Furthermore, they had outlets in Southeast Asia and India, which Chinese cotton mills could not hope to match. Comparing interior cotton mills with those in treaty ports, interior cotton mills found workers easier to train and manage, resulting in higher work efficiency. Additionally, they were either close to consumer markets or raw material production areas, giving them a considerable advantage over treaty port factories. Northern cotton mills had always relied on the Northeast as a major outlet, but recently, this route has been cut off, making business even more difficult than for southern cotton mills. However, according to the principle of survival of the fittest, the more intense the competition, the faster the improvement. Those lacking knowledge and with corrupt management will naturally be eliminated, while those with excellent technology and rational management will survive. Analyzing Chinese cotton mills in the current year reveals significant differences. Given China's large population, these five million spindles account for approximately one per hundred people. Japan, with a population of sixty million, still has eight million spindles. Therefore, the future of China's cotton industry should not be considered as having reached its peak. At the same time, domestic cotton cloth is easier to compete with foreign goods due to the gradual increase in import tariffs, providing protection. Therefore, for Chinese cotton mills, it is advisable to strive to reduce costs and improve production to strengthen their competitiveness. On the one hand, they should choose inland areas with higher yarn sales or more convenient raw material supply to establish factories and avoid pressure from foreign factories. Now, the Cotton Industry Control Association is actively working on cotton planting improvement, ensuring a more sufficient supply of raw materials in the interior. This should not be ignored by those engaged in the cotton yarn business. The comparison between Chinese and Japanese cotton mills is as follows:</p>
<p>Factory Number Chinese Japanese</p>
<p>Factories 89 41</p>
<p>Spindles 2,637,413 1,790,748</p>
<p>Percentage of National Total 57.19 38.84</p>
<p>Thread Spindles 135,860 272,700</p>
<p>Percentage of National Total 33.25 66.75</p>
<p>Looms 19,081 17,592</p>
<p>Percentage of National Total 48.234 44.46</p>
<p>Flour Milling Industry</p>
<p>Flour mills are concentrated in the South, with the Northeast being the largest destination, followed by the North. Domestic flour sales to the Northeast were approximately four million bags, but recently, they have been no more than tens of thousands of bags. The North has seen the dumping of cheap Japanese and Russian flour, impacting local flour mills in Tianjin. The destination routes for southern flour mills are even narrower due to unrest in the Guangdong area, weak purchasing power among the people, and merchants' reluctance to stockpile goods. Especially this year, with abundant wheat harvests in various regions, rural farmers are consuming flour ground locally, further hindering flour sales. At the same time, the establishment of American flour and wheat loans coincided with the new wheat harvest season, leading to a sharp drop in flour prices to a decades-low, from 2.67 yuan to around 2 yuan. Factories' inventories piled up, with Shanghai's highest inventory reaching over 3 million bags. Tianjin and Hankou also had over 2 million bags. As a last resort, factories announced shutdowns after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Later, to provide for workers' livelihoods, they operated in shifts. Among those that closed were Minfeng in Tianjin and Lifeng in Ningbo. Generally speaking, for the flour industry this year, raw material and flour prices fell simultaneously. Those who produced and sold immediately could mostly profit. Unlike the yarn industry, which faces foreign competition, as long as one acts cautiously, there should be no major losses. Recently, the imposition of import tariffs on foreign flour provides manufacturers with some breathing room.</p>
<p>Silk Reeling Industry</p>
<p>Silk reelers in the twenty-second year acted cautiously due to the majority of losses in the previous year. Even farmers raising silkworms dared not expand. Fortunately, the weather was favorable, resulting in a larger cocoon yield and relatively stable cocoon prices. After manufacturers purchased spring cocoons, silk prices suddenly rose, allowing for some profit. However, with the second harvest in summer and autumn, cocoon prices increased while foreign silk markets steadily declined, causing manufacturers to turn profits into losses. Although exports this year increased by 18% compared to last year, the drop in silk prices was more severe than last year. In the American market, silk prices reached a high of 895 yuan and a low of 640 yuan last year. This year, the high was 990 yuan, but the low was only around 500 yuan. Moreover, the highest price was merely a flash in the pan. According to this year's figures, Japanese silk production increased by 9.2%, equivalent to 50,000 piculs, while American consumption decreased by 84,000 piculs. At the same time, the production of rayon is increasing daily. Given the small quantity, high cost, poor quality, and unsound marketing system of Chinese raw silk, its inability to stand its ground under the pressure of these global trends is self-evident. This year, the average cost of spring and autumn cocoons was 700 yuan. Adding reeling wages and other expenses of about 150 yuan, the cost per picul reached over 800 yuan. However, silk prices fell to over 500 yuan, resulting in losses for most silk reelers. Among the silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, totaling over 110, only 5 or 6 factories in Shanghai, a dozen in Wuxi, and 6 or 7 in Zhejiang continued operating by the end of the year, less than one-fifth. Therefore, the decline of the silk industry has reached a critical stage. In the future, it will be impossible to save it without improving raw materials, advancing technology, and fundamentally reforming. The path to improving raw materials and advancing technology can only succeed through modern scientific methods, not through the old-fashioned, piecemeal remedies. Now, there is a Silk Industry Improvement Committee dedicated to fundamental improvement. There is no shortage of people in the silk industry with new knowledge who are using modern methods for management and working hard. It cannot be said that there is no hope of revival.</p>
<p>Cigarette Industry</p>
<p>In recent years, the sales of domestic cigarettes have gradually increased, and the establishment of Chinese cigarette factories has surged, reaching as many as 156. However, only a few have a larger scale and complete equipment. This year, due to the increase in consolidated taxes, the prevalence of locally produced cigarettes in various regions, and the weak purchasing power of the people, business in various factories has been far worse than before. Small factories have closed down one after another, and now only about 50 or 60 remain. In the twentieth year, the consolidated taxes paid by Chinese factories were higher than those paid by British-American Tobacco companies. In the twenty-first year, they were roughly equal. This year, they were lower than those paid by British-American Tobacco. In the future, the inability of small factories to survive and the need for large factories to improve are clear trends. What is worth studying is that the confrontation between Chinese cigarette factories and British-American Tobacco companies is similar to the relationship between Chinese cotton mills and Japanese cotton mills. However, the Shanxi Provincial Government has self-managed cigarette factories and promotes its products with the power of the government. Currently, the monthly sales of British-American Tobacco in Shanxi cannot exceed one-third of the sales of the Shanxi self-managed cigarette factories. The Shandong Provincial Government has also recently introduced measures to encourage the products of Chinese self-managed cigarette factories. This is one aspect of a new trend in the cigarette industry.</p>
<p>Match Industry</p>
<p>The Chinese match industry has gradually declined since the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. By the eighteenth and nineteenth years, it was in a precarious state. However, after the implementation of increased tariffs in January of the twentieth year, the import of foreign matches decreased, and Chinese manufacturers gradually saw a turnaround. This year was the most stable year for business. Starting from the twenty-first year, the industry re-entered a bleak period, and various factories lowered prices one after another. This year, larger factories can still survive, while smaller factories are in extreme distress. The main reason is the unlimited production volume of each factory. For example, in the eighteenth year, the output was only 600,000 boxes. It increased to 700,000 boxes in the nineteenth year and returned to 600,000 boxes in the twentieth year. However, it suddenly increased to 730,000 boxes in the twenty-first year. However, the imported foreign matches that decreased due to the increased tariffs were only over 50,000 boxes. Ignoring sales, each factory arbitrarily increased production, leading to price competition. The selling price of 53 or 4 yuan per box in the past is now only 40 yuan. The selling price of 20 yuan in the past is now only about 12 yuan. The selling price only covers the cost or even falls below the cost. Therefore, if the match industry itself does not quickly unite and limit production, it is feared that all will be unable to sustain themselves. There are over 50 match factories nationwide. Foreign merchants have established seven factories, but their output accounts for about a quarter of that of Chinese factories, indicating that strong competitors to Chinese match factories still exist.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities Industry</p>
<p>Rubber Industry:</p>
<p>Due to the increase in new factories, overproduction, and accumulated inventory, the value of goods has fallen. Top-quality overshoes, which used to sell for 11 or 12 yuan per dozen, have now dropped to 8 or 9 yuan. Inferior goods from small factories sell for just over 5 yuan. It is rumored that there are over 4 million pairs in stock. Among the 50 or so rubber factories in Shanghai, large and small, more than one-fifth have suspended or ceased operations this year. Among the remaining two-thirds, only 6 or 7 are doing relatively well.</p>
<p>Cosmetics Industry:</p>
<p>There are 40 or 50 factories. The total business volume this year should be around 7 million yuan. Six or seven larger factories are still making profits, while smaller ones are just breaking even.</p>
<p>Soap Industry:</p>
<p>It has also developed significantly in recent years, with 50 or so factories, large and small. However, only a dozen or so have a larger scale. Their products are not only sold domestically but also exported to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Enamelware Industry:</p>
<p>There are a dozen or so factories in Shanghai. Business this year has been average, with a total volume of approximately 4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Acid Production:</p>
<p>It is one of the emerging industries in recent years. There are currently two acid production plants.</p>
<p>Electric Battery Industry:</p>
<p>There are a dozen or so establishments. Larger ones can produce 15,000 batteries per day, while smaller ones produce between 2,000 and 7,000. Approximately 1.3 million batteries can be produced each month, with an annual output of 12 to 13 million batteries. Annual imports of Japanese goods are about 6 to 7 million batteries. Foreign factories in China also produce 6 to 7 million batteries. However, China's total annual demand is only 16 to 17 million batteries, leading to oversupply. Coupled with the dumping of cheap foreign goods, it is difficult for various factories to profit.</p>
<p>Knitting Industry:</p>
<p>There are over 200 factories, large and small, in Shanghai. Business this year has decreased by approximately 38%.</p>
<p>Food Seasoning Industry:</p>
<p>There are too many factories, leading to fierce price competition. Several have been unable to sustain themselves and have closed down. The total business volume for the year is only 3 to 4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabric Industry:</p>
<p>It has recently shown slight signs of growth. The business of the Tianjin Dongya Factory is still good.</p>
<p>In addition, the business volume of industries such as alkali production, mechanized stone powder, and mercerized cotton weaving is not significant and does not vary greatly.</p>
<p>Recent Three-Year Trends in Domestic Industries</p>
<p>The following is a record of the growth and decline indices of the business volume of various industries over the past three years based on investigations. However, we dare not consider them absolutely accurate. (Assuming the business volume in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China is 100)</p>

<p>China's industry has shown some glimmer of hope in recent years. However, due to the decline of rural areas, the impact of the global recession, the pressure from foreign merchants establishing factories in China, and the reckless competition among businesses, this budding industry is facing the risk of setbacks and stagnation. It is hoped that the industrial sector will thoroughly realize this, jointly work to improve technology, eliminate reckless competition, and that the government will supervise technological improvement and restrict reckless competition. This will demonstrate the effectiveness of unified national implementation of controls. The future of industry will be promising.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Industrial Control and Inflation <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Economic control and inflation have become major tools for various countries to protect property and relieve people's livelihoods. The officials and people of our country, alarmed by the decline of industry and the pressure of foreign goods, are vigorously advocating for imitation. Initially, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, together with the silk industry and financial sector, established the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silkworm Silk Control Committee. Next, the Economic Commission established the Cotton Industry Control Committee. In addition, the Shanxi Provincial Government established an economic control research institution to prepare various control plans. Given the shallow knowledge of the Chinese people and the weak foundation of emerging industries, it would be as difficult as waiting for the Yellow River to clear to expect the nation to awaken and act on its own to revive the economy. If we take the established rules of control in various countries as the only shortcut to saving China's industry, we fear that it will not only fail to be effective but may also hinder the progress of industrial development. The industrial controls of various countries are mostly due to overproduction after industrial development, while China's problem lies in the degradation and inadequacy of production. Therefore, various countries are focusing on the control of prices, sales, production volume, and demand. What China should pay attention to is the control of variety and grade. Improving variety and grade depends on the production education of farmers and the technical education of workers. These are the common basic conditions for the development of industries in various countries, and no country can skip steps. Industrial control is not impossible, but the stages of implementation must be distinguished. It is appropriate to start with the control of product varieties and, on the other hand, to promote the universalization of production education and vocational education. The scope of control should be limited to what can be managed with political power. The implementation of control should be shifted according to the preparation of statistics and talents. Some also advocate trade control. The so-called trade control intends to increase exports and reduce imports. However, the preconditions are whether there are exports with excellent quality and uniform grades, and whether there is a sufficient supply. Otherwise, even if there is demand but no supply, control is impossible. Those who advocate for inflation believe that low agricultural product prices and a lack of production funds can be addressed by increasing the amount of funds and raising agricultural product prices through the mechanism of inflation. Some also advocate reducing the fineness of currency to achieve the goal of inflation and to resist the excessive increase in the price of silver in the United States. Those with some economic knowledge can explain the role of inflation. However, there is a premise: does China already have a sound currency system? It is like having perfect machinery to fully utilize its effectiveness. Today, the non-uniform fineness and prices of China's subsidiary currencies and the lack of a system for bank-issued paper money mean that the credibility of silver dollars after the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan is still in the testing phase. Therefore, what the people trust is the substance of the currency, not the currency that represents the substance. The credit of currency has not been established. How can we fully utilize its elastic function? Therefore, the theory of inflation is not impossible, but establishing a sound currency system is a prerequisite. The Chinese people regard discussions about currency system reform as stale rhetoric. If this basic work is not carried out, even if various countries have good methods and intentions, they cannot be transferred to China. Presenting theories is no different from drooling over the butcher's shop without buying meat. It is hoped that the government will re-examine the various currency reforms studied in the past and establish a complete and feasible system in the shortest possible time so that China's currency can also fully utilize its function of saving the national economy. It is especially hoped that the Chinese people will not simply regard economic control and inflation as novel shortcuts and forget the great foundation of construction!</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Soundness of Finance <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The seriousness of the country's economic situation and the urgency of treatment have been described above. However, looking back at the current financial situation of the government and the financial organization of society, we cannot help but feel that they are moving in opposite directions. The central government's total annual revenue is over 680 million yuan, while its expenditure is over 828.9 million yuan. The annual deficit is consistently over 140 million yuan, with military spending accounting for the majority. The number of public bonds issued annually, excluding the twenty-first year, is often in the amount of 11 or 120 million yuan. The only funds available to society are absorbed by high-interest public bonds, and everyone sighs and resents the lack of funds for construction and production. Without production funds, how can we seek improvement and advancement in production and achieve a balance of trade? Without economic construction, how can we increase the purchasing power of the people and promote the rise of prices? The issuance volume of Shanghai Chinese banks in the twenty-second year was 454,143,165 yuan, an increase of over 23 million yuan compared to the twenty-first year. The total amount of deposits is estimated to be 210 million yuan, an increase of approximately 10 million yuan compared to last year. In Shanghai alone, six new banks were established, and existing banks added 16 branch offices, all inclined to invest in public bonds and real estate due to a lack of good, high-interest investments. Those who pay attention to business also find that the channels for lending are narrow, and they do not carefully select borrowers' credit and collateral discounts. The unreasonable expansion of credit is becoming more and more serious. Under these unsound financial conditions, if the government sees the rise in public bond prices as a sign of improved government credit and banks see the abundance of idle funds as a symbol of increased social wealth, then there is a great misunderstanding. There is one more fact that deserves attention: the silver reserves of foreign banks are increasing daily. Last year, they accounted for 42.22%, while this year, they account for 50.35%. If the state does not know how to economize on spending, the people's production cannot be improved, exports do not increase, and imports do not decrease, then the trend of cash flowing into foreign banks will become increasingly serious, and the people's wealth will continue to decrease. Who knows if there will be a day when deposits decrease and credit contracts? The difficulty of maintaining public bond prices and the lack of channels for public bond issuance are all expected. This is a cause for deep concern about the future of finance. The remedies are only for the government to substantially reduce military spending, eliminate unnecessary expenditures, reduce the issuance of public bonds, and increase production and construction funds. The financial sector should reduce interest rates, lower costs, and seek the accumulation of strength in preparation for contingencies. At the same time, the government should save 10 or 20 million yuan annually to establish a debt reduction fund, consolidate domestic and foreign debt to establish external credit, and attract foreign investment. On the one hand, establish a central and local harmonized issuance system to achieve the establishment of a currency system and increase currency credit and quantity. Our financial sector has been longing for the soundness of finance for several years, and now there is a real sense of urgency.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Hubei Defeats Shanghai in the First Game of the Far East Basketball Preliminary Round, Making a Stunning Impression. 39-43 Renowned Players from the Hubei Team Display Extraordinary Skills. The Shanghai Team's Carelessness on the Court Led to a Big Mistake. Tonight at 8 PM: Nanjing vs. Shanghai. <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai vs. Hubei in the first game of the Far East basketball preliminary round took place at 8 PM last night at the baseball field's open-air court. There were 300-400 spectators. Shanghai's initial ten minutes of slackness led to a situation that was hard to turn around. Later line-up changes attempted to develop the game, and although they briefly surpassed with a score of 29-27 in the second half, they ultimately lost 39-43 in a miserable defeat. Hubei's outstanding talent and tight formation made their victory over Shanghai not accidental. Tonight at 8 PM, Shanghai will compete against Nanjing.</p>
<p>The two teams' strengths: Shanghai's guards did not seem to exert their full effort. Lu and Sun both had merits and demerits. Forwards Qian and Feng were too impatient and repeatedly missed opportunities. Chen Xianglong was extremely steady, accumulating points and performing the best. Hubei's Wu Guolin's defense was especially effective. Chen Shengkui was as brave as ever, serving as a cornerstone of the team. Yu Jingxiao lived up to his name as the only center talent. Ge Ke was also not weak. Wang Jianming worked very hard. The entire team had sufficient strength and coordinated well, unlike Shanghai, which was flustered and disorganized.</p>
<p>Disorganized Line-up: Shanghai initially started with Hu Zhengqu, Zhou Dayun, Qiu Guangxie, Chen Zongqi, and Zhang Jinxiang, but they were at a loss. Although the opponent repeatedly fouled, they all missed the opportunities. The score went from 2-10 to 5-16, and the situation was precarious. The five players were completely replaced to reorganize. Chen Xianglong repeatedly contributed, while Hubei continued to flourish. The first half ended with a score of 15-25, with Shanghai at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Shanghai Surpassed: During the break, several gasoline lamps were extinguished and two were broken by the ball. Replacements were made, delaying the start by five minutes. However, due to the lack of four lamps, the light was dimmer. Shanghai tried to counterattack with great momentum. Chen Xianglong scored three consecutive times, and Sun Baoqing responded with two, scoring a total of ten points, making the score a tie at 25-25. It was thought that Shanghai had a chance to turn things around. Before long, Hubei's Ge Ke scored, taking the lead again with a score of 27-25. Shanghai continued its efforts, and Sun and Chen made further contributions, taking the lead with a score of 29-27.</p>
<p>Ultimately Defeated: At this point, the Shanghai team seemed to have the hope of directly attacking the enemy's stronghold. Who knew that after a short standoff, Ge Ke scored again, making it a tie again. Wu and Chen scored twice, making it 31-29, with the Shanghai team still succumbing. Later, the score became 32-32 and 34-34. Unexpectedly, from then on,</p>
<p>The Shanghai team repeatedly missed opportunities, and the match became more intense. The Shanghai team's forwards were sloppy, and Hubei took the opportunity to rise, with Chen Shengkui and Ge Ke scoring successively, soaring to 41-34. The Shanghai team made a final struggle, making it 38-41, but ultimately time ran out, making it impossible to recover, and they narrowly lost 39-43. The referees were Jin Zhaojun and Wu Jiatang.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Participation in the Far Eastern Games Preliminary Track and Field Trials Completed; Four New National Records Created - Shot Put, Discus, Javelin, 10,000 Meters - Rain and Cold Weather Affected Other Results <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Our country's preliminary track and field trials for the 10th Far Eastern Games were completed yesterday afternoon, resulting in four new national records: (1) Chen Baoqiu, shot put, 12.655 meters; (2) Leng Peigen, discus, 37.85 meters; (3) Peng Yongxin, javelin, 48.92 meters; (4) Sun Che, 10,000 meters, 34 minutes 49 seconds. Other results were either affected by the cold spring weather, the small number of participants reducing the competitive interest, or the loose and wet ground after the rain, resulting in mediocre performances that were disappointing. It is hoped that after the association makes its selections, they will practice diligently and make rapid progress. The preliminary results are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e189">Quick Notes on the Preliminary Track Events <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>(100 Meters) Only five participants, Liu Changchun, who was closely watched, stood aside. Although he registered, he did not participate, reportedly to focus on the 200 meters. Others such as Wang Jihuai, Xu Biao, and Hao Chunde also did not participate. The race started after the second gunshot. The situation was very even. A difference only became apparent at 60 meters, with Cheng Jinguan and Zhao Bingheng slightly ahead. At the finish line, Zhao trailed Cheng Jinguan by a shoulder. Han Jinglin came in third. Gu Zaiping was also very close to Han. Su Xiaoru, whose foot had not fully recovered, came in last. Cheng's time of 11 seconds was good. Zhao's was 11.1 seconds.</p>
<p>(200 Meters) Liu Changchun took to the field for the 200 meters, showcasing his skills, as it is his specialty. Only four people participated. Cheng Jinguan and Wang Jihuai did not participate. Liu took the lead within 40 meters of the start and led all the way to the end. Zhao Bingheng and Han Jinglin competed fiercely. At the finish line, Liu was five meters ahead of Han, and Han beat Zhao by a shoulder, avenging his loss in the 100 meters. Liu's time of 22.7 seconds was not outstanding.</p>
<p>(400 Meters) Only four participants, but although the national record was not broken, the competition was more exciting. Dong Shuzhao gave up the 800 meters to focus on this event. He indeed prevailed with 53.9 seconds over Zeng Rongzhong, a good result. Dong led all the way, and Zeng chased closely behind at 300 meters. However, at the finish line, Zeng was still six meters behind Dong. Zeng's time of 54.8 seconds was his usual performance. Li Yanxiang was third with 55.5 seconds.</p>
<p>(800 Meters) Four participants. With Dong Shuzhao's withdrawal, Luo Qinglong had no opponent. He led all the way. Jia Lianren and Li Yanxiang fought fiercely. At 600 meters, Jia surged ahead of Li. After another 50 meters, Li was in front of Jia. After another 50 meters, Li fell behind Jia again. From then on, Jia remained in second place. Luo was six meters ahead of Jia, and Li was three meters behind Jia. Luo's time of 2 minutes 6.7 seconds was mediocre. (1,500 Meters) Another competition of four people. Zheng Sen took the lead from the start, followed by Hou Dechong, Dong Jiaxie, and Yin Zongchen. Zheng was still in the lead at 400 meters and 800 meters, followed by Hou. Yin Zongchen had already surpassed Dong, but they were closely packed, with very little difference. At 1,200 meters, Yin Zongchen surpassed Hou Dechong. In the last 300 meters, Yin sprinted up, overtaking Zheng Sen and finishing first by six meters. The time of 4 minutes 6.7 seconds was very disappointing.</p>
<p>(High Hurdles) Liu Xiangjun, Chen Jiayou, and Chen Guojun competed. One second after the starting gun, Liu suddenly stopped and returned to the starting point. The starter, Jiang Xiangqing, saw this and fired a second gun, calling back the two Chens to rerun. As a result of the rerun, Liu Yingjun finished first with 17 seconds, but knocked down one hurdle. Chen Jiayou knocked down two hurdles, while Chen Guojun did not jump over a single hurdle, resulting in his score being canceled, an unexpected poor performance. (Hurdles) Wang Jingxi arrived late and competed against Tao Yingjie. They advanced side by side, with the difference only becoming apparent after 200 meters. At this point, Wang Jingxi knocked down a hurdle, and Tao seized the opportunity to take the lead. Tao was three meters ahead of Wang, with a time of 60 seconds, showing no improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The 10,000 Meters is Highly Interesting, Sun Che's Skills are Exceptional - Time of 34 Minutes 49 Seconds - Top Three All Set New Records - Shanxi Athletes are Very Popular <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The 10,000-meter race attracted the most attention. The bald-headed long-distance runners from Shanxi were welcomed by the audience. Sun Che, who recently set a new record of 34 minutes 1 second in Tianjin, and Gu Desheng, Wang Zhenglin, and Jin Zhongkang, who were involved in disputes at the National Games, were all present. Even a rickshaw puller participated, but dropped out halfway. In reality, there were only six runners. Gu Desheng also dropped out at 8,000 meters, so only five people finished. As a result, Sun Che indeed broke the national record with a time of 34 minutes 49 seconds, overwhelming the others.</p>
<p>(Sun Che Finished First) Sun Che remained in first place from the first lap to the 25th lap. The greatest distance was at 8,000 meters, when he was 60 meters ahead of Chen Shusen and over 400 meters ahead of Jin Zhongkang. At the finish line, he showed no signs of fatigue, which was truly remarkable. The second-place finisher, Chen Shusen, also remained in second place throughout the race. His sprint in the final lap was impressive, catching up from 40 meters to finish only three meters behind Sun Che. Chen's time of 34 minutes 51.8 seconds also broke the national record.</p>
<p>(Wang Zhenglin Made Great Progress) Wang Zhenglin's third-place finish, with a time of 35 minutes 10.8 seconds, also broke the national record, showing commendable progress. He closely followed Li Denggui throughout the race. At 8,000 meters, he suddenly surged ahead, overtaking Li and taking the lead. However, in the final 1,000 meters, Li regained the lead, but Wang eventually pulled ahead again by a distance of ten meters to finish third. Jin Zhongkang, although lagging behind by 400 meters, still finished the entire race.</p>
<p>(5) Chen Baoqiu Sets New National Record in Shot Put (Photo by Ye Changlie)</p>
<h3 id="e191">Overview of Field Event Competitions <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>(New Shot Put Record) Chen Baoqiu confidently took the crown, as was expected. His usual results had exceeded 13 meters, so there were high hopes for him to achieve that goal. However, try after try, he was unsuccessful. Fortunately, on his fourth attempt, he surpassed the 12-meter mark, reaching a new national record of 12.655 meters, surpassing the 12.55 meters at the White Rainbow Games. This was satisfactory. Liu Renxiu's first attempt was 12.335 meters, also a new record, but he showed no further improvement. The big man, Liu Furun, was third with 12.05 meters. Yang Yongcan was fourth, failing to reach the 12-meter mark. Cheng Bichun's result was less than 10 meters, and it was a bit overconfident of him to participate in the preliminary trials.</p>
<p>(New Discus Record) Leng Peigen had a good result of 37.64 at the White Rainbow Games. Yesterday, with the competition from Zhang Lingjia and Liu Jingren, he was particularly careful. His first two attempts were not satisfactory. On his third throw, he achieved his goal, reaching 37.85 meters, surpassing Liu Renxiu's national record of 36.50 meters, and it was against the wind. Zhang Lingjia was third with 36.02 meters, and Cheng Bichun was fourth with 32.40 meters, which was mediocre.</p>
<p>(Very Satisfied with the Javelin) Peng Yongxin's javelin skills have long been famous in the country. After setting a new national record of 48.92 meters at last year's National Games, he broke his own record with over 50 meters in the North China preliminary trials. Yesterday, despite facing headwinds, he was still able to maintain his usual skills, achieving 49.23 meters, which was not easy. Tang Xianzhou was second with 46.12 meters, which was also not bad. Pan Chengbin was third with 44.71 meters, which was far worse than the 48.24 he achieved in the pentathlon at his school's sports meet, indicating that he was still not confident. Hao Chunde was fourth with 43.80.</p>
<p>(Great Disappointment in the High Jump) Gu or Wang Shilin and Wu Bixian had all cleared 1 meter 80 in the past, but they have regressed significantly recently. Gu has been out of practice for a long time, and Wang Shilin recently equaled the national record with 1.82 meters at the North China preliminary trials, but he was very disappointing yesterday. No one achieved much. In the end, Wang Shilin, Wu Bixian, Gu or Ge Ke, and Liu Mingru were the last five, competing for the height of 1.75 meters. Only Wu Bixian cleared it, while the others failed. The cold weather and piercing wind certainly had a significant impact.</p>
<p>(Significant Regression in the Long Jump) Before the jump, the 6.91-meter mark was measured to motivate the competitors. Everyone was dispirited and unsuccessful, with significant regression. Wang Jihuai achieved 6.485 meters on his third jump, securing his victory. Hao Chunde jumped 6.30 meters on his third jump. Lu Yaxiong jumped 6.43 meters on his final jump, surpassing Hao and finishing second. Zhang Jiakui was fourth with 6.205.</p>
<p>(Pole Vault in Poor Condition) Only Fu Baolu, Wang He, and Huang Yi participated. Fu's first place was not in question, but his results regressed significantly. Huang Yi failed at 3.26 meters. Wang He was eliminated at 3.33 meters. Fu Baolu cleared 3.51 meters and then attempted 3.66 meters four times, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>(Triple Jump Obstructed) The triple jump was the last event in the track and field competition. At that time, the audience surged into the field, surrounding the jumping pit, making it impossible to hold the event properly. The audience's lack of order was deplorable, and the lack of prior preparation of the venue was also regrettable. As a result, the results were greatly affected, and the event was hastily concluded. Situ Guang achieved 13.41 on his second jump. Yang Daogui achieved 13.66 on his sixth jump, surpassing Situ to win the championship. Zhang Jiakui was third with 13.05, and Lu Yaxiong was fourth with 12.49.</p>

<p>The Philippines Replied that the Charter Must First Be Revised (National News Agency, Manila, 13th) The Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation issued a reply to Japan today, stating that the Philippine side is acting entirely in the spirit of sportsmanship, without any other purpose. The Association pointed out that the Philippines has already expressed approval for Manchukuo's participation and hopes that Japan's wishes to help Manchukuo can be realized based on the Far East Charter passed in Tokyo in 1930. However, this proposal must be agreed upon by all members, and China has expressed opposition, so the realization of this matter is impossible. We sincerely hope that the Japanese Sports Association will recognize the legislative position and make it impossible to resolve Manchukuo's participation in accordance with the charter. If Japan hopes to revise the charter at this general assembly, the Philippines is willing to consider this proposal in detail. Everything will be based on the most friendly spirit and the attitude of sportsmen.</p>

<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th) The Far East Games issue is still in critical condition. The Japan Athletic Association is making every effort. The Philippine Islands held an executive committee this morning and decided on a reply to Japan. Its reply is expected to reach Japan this evening. Future developments will depend on the content of the reply. The Association will hold a full meeting tonight to discuss and determine its final attitude. However, since it will be consulting with Dr. Yamamoto and Kazutsuru Matsuzawa, the final decision may be made on the night of the 15th, but depending on the content of the Philippine Islands' reply, it is also possible that it will decide not to participate in the Games.</p>

<h3 id="e210">A Critique of Two Views on Love: Biyun <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Biyun</p>
<p>When we talk about "love," people immediately feel a sense of sweetness, as if it contains endless allure. But, is this allure, this sweetness, detached from everything else? Is it the primary purpose of life? Then our poets and artists, all those who uphold the supreme importance of love, will smile and answer: Yes! There is no life without love; love is supreme, divine.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, being immersed in the sea of love all day long, subsisting only on kisses without eating anything else, cannot withstand the hunger in one's stomach. Without food to eat, without a house to live in, even without clothes to wear, the god of love, "Venus," will not grace you with its presence. Thus, so-called "divine love" cannot transcend the material necessities upon which human survival depends. In other words, even those who say "love is purely spiritual" cannot live on love alone while starving!</p>
<p>Moreover, love is also subject to the limitations of time and space. In feudal societies, women were bound by the "three obediences and four virtues," and there was no talk of love at all; they were merely slaves of men, or rather, more accurately, slaves of society. Even if a few women at that time were able to savor the "taste of love," it was not the result of their own pursuit, but rather a stroke of unfathomable luck under the dictates of "parents' orders and matchmakers' words." By the time of so-called "civilized society" in modern times, the situation is different. Men and women can freely choose their partners, and on the surface, they seem to be free from any restrictions. Thus, various theories such as "free love" and "the divinity of love" have become a temporary fashion of this era. However, in reality, although love at this time is not bound by etiquette, it is dictated by money. "With money, you can make the devil push the millstone," and "love" at this time can also be bought with money. Don't you see wealthy old men in their forties and fifties talking about "free love" with school queens in their teens? Don't you see thousands upon thousands of young women selling their bodies and souls to many strangers every night? This is the factual manifestation of how so-called divine love is subject to the control of money. If women were slaves in feudal societies, then women, and even the majority of men, in so-called civilized societies in modern times are commodities that can be bought and sold. The so-called "free love" and "divinity of love" here are simply self-deceiving lies!</p>
<p>Since love is subject to the limitations of human life and the constraints of time and space, the primary purpose of life is not love, but the struggle for survival. Without survival, there is nothing, and therefore there is no talk of love. Those who are oppressed by life's pressures will inevitably suffer from pain, and the so-called "enjoyment of love" will be out of the question. Therefore, the meaning of life in the present society lies in striving for liberation and progress in life. This meaning is especially important when the majority of people are subjected to the cruel oppression of life.</p>
<p>However, here comes another strange opinion, and this opinion comes from many new young men and women: the "purely sexualist" view that completely denies the function of human emotions.</p>
<p>Some modern young men and women, in opposing the supremacy of love, believe that the relationship between the sexes is nothing more than "sexual desire." Thus, they vent their sexual desire here today and steal affections there tomorrow. These are simply superficial materialists who have lost their minds and emotions, simpletons who do not understand what "love" is.</p>
<p>Of course, love cannot exist independently without a sexual relationship, but we cannot therefore completely deny it. Prostitutes are constantly venting their lust, but they are often in a sea of ​​misery and have no love. A couple with a bad relationship, although they sometimes have sexual relations, the fact of divorce is very common because there is no strong affection between them. These facts shatter the views of those sexualists who completely deny love!</p>
<p>If those who uphold the supremacy of love consider love to be the primary purpose of life, then extreme sexualists, in their desperate pursuit of sexual satisfaction, will also abandon the true meaning of life and live solely to satisfy their sexual lives. Both are unique to people in the present society who feel that everything is meaningless and the future is bleak. Here, the extreme left (purely sexualist) and extreme right (supremacy of love) opinions on the issue of love converge on different paths.</p>
<p>While poets and artists who generally sing the praises of the supremacy of love are ridiculous, the new young men and women who advocate pure sexualism are even more proof of their immaturity and ignorance. They believe that they are thoroughly opposing the decadent and decadent views of love of the petty bourgeoisie, but they do not realize that they are unknowingly embarking on the path of decadence and decadence themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, we are not ascetics and do not oppose young men and women from talking about love; not at all. We believe:</p>
<p>First, love is not supreme, but is subject to the limitations of human life, times, and society.</p>
<p>Second, love is not inferior, merely a means of venting sexual desire; we have never completely denied the role of emotions in love.</p>
<p>Third, love is not only a combination of sex and emotion, but also a combination of life. Our love must be built on a foundation of mutual understanding, mutual encouragement, and consistency in thought and action. Moreover, in life, we must constantly strive to improve human life and promote the work of social evolution.</p>
<p>Finally, we must not regard love as sacred and live for love, nor should we treat love as a game to be played with at will. These are all manifestations of decadence and decadence, and they hinder the progress of humanity.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Hygiene During Pregnancy <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Shen Jian'an</p>
<p>Pregnancy is a physiological phenomenon, not a disease. However, during pregnancy, the nutrients ingested by the mother must also be supplied to the fetus, so the resistance of various parts of the body is very weak. On the one hand, she suffers from inevitable physiological symptoms, such as headaches, weakness, loss of appetite, etc., which make the body very weak. At that time, if affected by an accidental illness, it will have a great impact on the health and life of both mother and child. Therefore, the suffering of ten months of pregnancy also becomes the bond that binds mother and child together like their lives! Especially in Chinese society, where general medical knowledge is not widespread, the three matters of pregnancy and childbirth seem to be hovering on the crossroads of life and death. Therefore, many women with some knowledge but not thoroughly understand the process are averse to pregnancy, and even avoid marriage. This is not an optimistic phenomenon for society and the nation. But is pregnancy ultimately dangerous? Painful? Certainly not. This is a natural physiological phenomenon. As long as we pay a little attention during pregnancy, that is, if we obtain the way of hygiene, then pregnancy is not dangerous at all and will not be painful at all. Therefore, the method of hygiene during pregnancy is something that everyone should understand, so as to create a healthy and happy mother's body and future little citizens! Now I will explain the simplest and most important points one by one for women to refer to!</p>
<p>Exercise</p>
<p>Violent exercise should be absolutely prohibited. Normally, one should seek physical tranquility, but one should not lie in bed all day long. It is best to do appropriate gentle exercises, often inhale fresh air, take walks outdoors, get more sunlight, so as to refresh the mind, and do less of the usual strenuous housework. Long-distance travel, mountain climbing, going upstairs, dancing, horseback riding, cycling, carrying or lifting heavy objects, etc. must be absolutely prohibited. Even prolonged sitting, playing cards, kneeling, washing, etc. are harmful and useless to the mother's body.</p>
<p>Food and Drink</p>
<p>Although it is not necessary to completely break the habits of the past, it is best to appropriately ingest nutritious, rich, and easily digestible things. All foods with too much fat, and things that easily produce gas in the intestines, and stimulating foods (such as peppers, chili peppers, eggplants, shochu, tobacco, etc.) should not be overeaten. However, a small amount of wine, weak tea, or coffee can increase the benefits for both the mother's body and the fetus.</p>
<p>Clothing</p>
<p>Clothes should be clean, loose, and comfortable. The chest and lower abdomen should not be tightly bound. The climate should be kept at an appropriate temperature, and should not be too hot or too cold. A belly band should be tied around the abdomen, with the purpose of maintaining the fetus's body temperature and fixing the position of the fetus. After wrapping the abdomen, the abdomen will not fall downwards, and the fetus will not be too large, making childbirth easier. In our country, it has always been thought that belly bands are harmful and useless. This is not right. Also, some women have always had the habit of tightly binding the chest and waist, so the abdomen is compressed and blood circulation is obstructed. As a result, facial swelling, lower limb varicose veins, etc. occur, and the health and development of the fetus are hindered. Special attention must be paid to these during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Bowel Movements</p>
<p>Pregnant women are most prone to constipation. After harmful gases in the intestines, it can cause various systemic symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, hemorrhoids, gastrointestinal diseases, etc. To prevent constipation, one must perform appropriate gentle exercises every day, eat fruit after meals, or drink a cup of cold boiled water or cold milk on an empty stomach in the morning. It is necessary to make her have a bowel movement at a certain time, succeeding in creating a natural habit. If there is no bowel movement for two days, one must ask a doctor to use soapy water enema or glycerin enema, or internal use of (MagSulfi50) fifteen grams of Epsom salt. However, general drastic purgatives sold in pharmacies often induce the disadvantages of premature birth or miscarriage, so they must be absolutely prohibited (if you have a disease during pregnancy, you must not take quinine pills, because quinine pills have the possibility of causing miscarriage for pregnant women.</p>
<p>Urination</p>
<p>In the early stages of pregnancy, you must not often keep urine in your bladder. When you have urine, you should excrete it, otherwise it will cause retroversion or retroflexion of the uterus, and sometimes proteinuria and diabetes may occur. It is best to often ask a doctor to check for the presence of protein or sugar, which can prevent diabetes or nephritis.</p>
<p>Mental State</p>
<p>The mental state of the mother's body will affect the fetus. This is called prenatal education. After the pregnant woman's spirit is adversely affected, health disorders occur, and in severe cases, miscarriage can occur. Therefore, pregnant women should often be quiet and recuperate, and should not often talk to pregnant women about difficult births, miscarriages, and all kinds of difficult news about first births, or strange stories about deformed fetuses, so as not to cause pregnant women to be frightened and affect the fetus. Pregnant women should not read novels, pictures, dramas, movies, etc. with strong stimuli, or excessive joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. The nerves should not be overworked, sleep must be sufficient, and a safe life must be had.</p>
<p>Body Cleanliness</p>
<p>After conception, there is often excessive secretion from the external genitalia, causing vulvitis or transmission of other diseases, so it must be washed with lukewarm water every day, and a bath must be taken once every two days. However, too hot or long-term bathing can cause termination of pregnancy. When washing, water should not be washed into the vagina, unless there is a vaginal lesion, can vaginal washing be performed! This vaginal washing has specialized equipment, so you must consult a doctor.</p>
<p>Breasts</p>
<p>The breast area must be liberated. It should not be tightly bound. In the last month of pregnancy, wash with clean water or alcohol to increase the resistance of the skin on the nipple area and prevent nipple cracks or transmission. If the nipple is underdeveloped or sunken, lift the nipple several times a day to gradually protrude the nipple, so that the baby will not feel difficult when breastfeeding after childbirth and the nipple will not hurt.</p>
<p>Sexual Intercourse</p>
<p>If you are sure that you are pregnant, sexual intercourse must be limited, otherwise it is often easy to transmit infections. Normally, after four months of pregnancy, sexual intercourse must be absolutely prohibited!</p>

<h3 id="e213">The Views of Great Thinkers of the World on the Woman Question (2) <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Two: Marie Gouze</p>
<p>Marie Gouze, whom we mentioned in our previous article on Condorcet, was one of the first women in the French Revolution to participate in political activities and organize the women's rights movement. She was born in Montauban in southern France, some say in 1753, others say in 1755. Her mother was either a dressmaker or a poor woman who picked up rags. Her father's background is unknown.</p>
<p>Marie Gouze was a lecturer. At that time, she often attended and lectured at women's group meetings, public gatherings, and the clubs of various political parties. She also attended and lectured at the French National Assembly after the revolution. At that time, the National Assembly allowed women to submit proposals and express opinions before discussing the issues listed on the agenda. Marie Gouze's enthusiastic and beautiful words, her clever arguments, and her gentle ideas repeatedly moved the national representatives. She changed the status quo by means of publishing pamphlets, writing essays, and issuing declarations.</p>
<p>Marie Gouze's activities can be mainly said to be a deep concern for the improvement of women's own status. She believed that the root of all evils was in men controlling women; she believed that the only way for women to reach the highest stage of human development was through freedom and women's rights. To obtain freedom and women's rights, the only way is to use the united strength of the oppressed. To encourage and unite women with wise and righteous demands, and to lead them to fight for women's true rights, this was Marie Gouze's basic goal of exhausting her talents and working hard. She said on a small "Women's Rights" leaflet:</p>
<p>"Men! Who gave you the right to oppress women? Please take a look at the entire natural world; is there anything in it that resembles your arbitrariness and violence? Try to look at living matter, ask the beasts, study the plants, investigate, explore, and analyze all the relationships between the sexes in nature; everywhere they are loving each other, everywhere there is the eternal, ingenious, innate harmony and unity of all things. You have just eliminated the privileges of the nobility, please also abolish the privileges of men! People are beginning to enjoy their rights, and black slaves are also being liberated. Why not liberate women?"</p>
<p>Marie Gouze tried her best to teach her own sisters to learn the cause of liberation. She said to them:</p>
<p>"Has the revolutionary era not yet arrived for us women? Should we live in solitude for all ages, and never actively participate in social construction?"</p>
<p>The famous "Declaration of the Rights of Man" during the French Revolution only explained the rights of men unilaterally, and did not mention women in a single word. Marie Gouze, in response to it, specifically issued a declaration that was almost equally famous: "Declaration of the Rights of Woman." She clearly, thoroughly, and movingly put forward the demand for complete equality for women in society and in politics. The full text of the declaration is translated on the left:</p>
<p>"Women are born free, with rights equal to those of men. The purpose of every good society is to protect the rights of both sexes, which cannot be deprived by any law; freedom, progress, security, and sanctions against oppression. ... But in fact, the rights of women endowed by nature have only been recognized within a narrow range so far. The nation upon which the state is built is composed of men and women, and the legal system should be an expression of the will of this society. All female citizens, just like all male citizens, should participate in self-government, individually or through representatives they elect. Self-government should be equal for all people. Therefore, all male and female citizens, according to their abilities, must be allowed to hold all social positions, powers, and duties; only the difference in their virtue and talent can be used as a standard for election. Women have the right to mount the rostrum, and they have the right to mount the lecture platform; they must enjoy both of these rights. However, women's rights should serve the common happiness, and should not serve the interests of sex.</p>
<p>Women, like men, should share the national currency; likewise, women, like men, have the right to demand that national treasury management be public. If the basic law of the country? When it is not formulated by the majority of the people who constitute the nation, it will definitely be invalid. Women, please try it... The torch of truth has already dispelled the black clouds of stupidity and tyranny; when will you regain your sight? Unite and use the power of reason and justice to resist brute force! You will soon see that men will no longer painfully pursue you, they will proudly raise their heads, puff out their chests, and share with you the rights of mankind for all ages, and advance hand in hand with you."</p>
<p>In short, Marie Gouze, in her leaflets, in her pamphlets, in her lectures, in political party clubs and academic groups, was everywhere excitedly arguing about the issue of women's rights. She founded the first magazine in history to promote the women's movement. At that time, the French National Assembly received countless petitions in favor of and against women's equality. Marie Gouze believed that the time had come to establish political organizations to unite women, so she founded her Women's Political Association and served as their leader and propagandist.</p>
<p>However, although Marie Gouze's words were ingenious and moving, her remarks on the woman question were still scattered and disorganized. She completely blamed men for the responsibility of existing social relations (which were formed due to economic necessity), believing that this was due to men's shortsightedness and selfishness, and neglected the background of social economics. This is something that should be paid attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e214">What I Have Seen of European Women <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Yang</p>
<p>This was already three years ago. When we arrived in England, France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, etc., we generally did not stay in hotels due to time and savings, economic relations. Instead, we rented houses and stayed in boarding houses (pensions), which are a type of apartment-style residence that provides room and board. There were many opportunities to get close to their families, so their lives were clearer.</p>
<p>Housewives: Although the standard of living in China has been increasing in recent years, it is still far different compared to European countries! Because people in China are cheap, it is very common for ordinary families to employ two or three servants. For example, in France, hiring a female worker costs five francs per hour; in Germany, it is about one mark (approximately one national currency). This type of female worker is almost a specialized profession. They attend school-like classes and can enter and exit many homes every day according to the hour. Therefore, being a housewife is busy from morning to night! The husband goes out to work early; they quickly send the older children to school; feed the younger children milk; wipe the furniture, sweep the floor and windows; and then push the children's strollers to the vegetable market to select the day's vegetables. Returning home, they take off their outer clothes, put on aprons, and cook food very carefully and hurriedly. They can't bear to waste five centimes (copper coins), let alone spend five francs to hire a female worker to take over for an hour. Especially on Saturdays, that is their big cleaning day, they should wash all the utensils. On that day, we can see old and young women flushing the gates and stairs with tap water and scrubbing hard with rough brushes. Only Sunday is their most leisurely and happy day. The family wears neat clothes; they go to the suburbs or parks to absorb fresh air; or visit museums and art galleries; of course, movie theaters, dance halls, and cafes also have their footprints; this is how they dispel the fatigue of the past six days!</p>
<p>Women in society: There are very many European women working outside. Female staff account for almost 80-90% of large companies, shops, and small schools. Girls must go out to earn a living and become independent at the age of seventeen or eighteen. However, their salaries are very low, with monthly incomes of only two or three hundred francs, or up to five hundred francs at most. They eat simply and save money slowly because they are not yet married! When a partner is selected, he will first ask her how much dowry she has, because she is responsible for everything needed for the two to form a family, such as tables, chairs, beds, bedding, and kitchen utensils; as for the subsequent life, he will be responsible for it. Women with ugly faces are very difficult to find a spouse! Or, if they marry the wrong person, once they get married, he will cheat her out of years of hard-earned savings and abandon her, which is even more pitiful! In addition, after the European war, countless men died or were disabled, and there were more women than men in society, so many of them would rather live alone. With the above-mentioned difficulties, most European women have married people of color from the East in recent years, especially our China. The students studying abroad are mostly young masters from the propertied class, who return home after completing their studies (?) and act as some committee member, some leader, or become university professors. Wouldn't they immediately enjoy happiness and become rich wives? Who would be willing to do the job of sweeping and cooking again! Of course, there are also those who do not change their original thrifty ways, which depends on the individual's environment!</p>
<h3 id="e215">Miss Clogs and the Black Prince's Engagement Suddenly Breaks Down <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Doing or not doing the Imperial Concubine is a small matter</p>
<p>Doing or not doing a Beauty Trap is a big matter</p>
<p>Two months ago, Japanese newspapers extensively reported that an Ethiopian prince from Africa, due to his admiration for Japanese women, was selecting a bride in Japan. For a time, there were many applicants. As a result, Masako Kuroda, the daughter of Viscount Kuroda, was selected, which was widely regarded as a beautiful story throughout the country, keeping news reporters and magazine editors busy. Recently, Masako has been busy preparing for the wedding day and night, when suddenly the Ethiopian ambassador to Italy said that the international marriage of the black prince would be dissolved due to strong interference from a certain country.</p>
<p>When the news came, it naturally made the island nation people, who never forgot overseas development, feel greatly disappointed. Miss Masako was, of course, even more embarrassed. When she first received this news, she was said to be very excited and not very convinced. Finally, she said calmly: "Even if the engagement is really dissolved, I will not be depressed because of this. At least my actions this time have made Japanese women realize that Japanese women should be active overseas... My personal affairs are small, but the fact that Japan is so internationally oppressed really needs to be considered. At the same time, my painstaking effort to marry a black man's wife should also be understood by the general public, so I can be very comforted..." These words are sufficient to represent the psychology of Japanese women.</p>
<p>(The above picture is Masako Kuroda, and above it is the Ethiopian prince from Africa in question)</p>
<h3 id="e216">A Female Clerk's Conversation <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Man Lun</p>
<p>One afternoon, I went with a friend to a large company to buy leather shoes. There, we happened to meet a naive and lively young female clerk. She very kindly and humbly brought us pairs of leather shoes to try on. My friend began to chat with her. She told us that she was a junior high school graduate from Yangzhou. Because there were many sisters in her family and her father had lost his job, their financial situation was extremely difficult. She heard that a large company in Shanghai was recruiting female clerks, so she resolutely applied and was fortunate enough to be hired. Now, her monthly salary is thirty yuan. She shares a small room with a companion, with each paying three yuan for rent and seven yuan for food. The remaining twenty yuan must be used to send fifteen yuan to her parents, leaving only five yuan for her own expenses, including making clothes. As she spoke, we forgot about buying leather shoes. She continued, saying that she had to be at the company by eight o'clock in the morning and couldn't leave until after eight o'clock in the evening. ...Since coming here a few months ago, she has only worked in her assigned section. Although the company is so large, she feels like she is in a prison. All day long, she has to spend her time there. It's obvious that the piercingly cold winter has passed, and the welcoming warmth of spring has arrived, but we have no chance to admire the lovely tender green and bright red flowers and grass, or the green willows dancing in the wind. By the time we stop work, the lights are already shining, and the most important thing is to go home and eat. So, although our living problems have been solved, our youth is passing by in such a dim way. She continued, saying that besides this kind of life, there is another thing that makes her feel annoyed, and that is the customers who come and go. The female customers don't cause any trouble, but those hateful, slick-haired men often use irrelevant words to flirt with us, getting entangled, and their intention is nothing more than teasing. When we have free time, we also like to read the newspaper, but many of the news and short articles in the newspaper often stimulate our nerves. We are daughters of good families. Being a clerk is something that men also do. We didn't expect those who write articles to use us as material for ridicule. A few days ago, there was a cartoon in a certain newspaper that was full of things insulting women. We female clerks are also among those being scolded. When we were in school, we heard the teacher say that people should support themselves, and many people advocate that women should be economically independent. Doesn't economic independence mean going out to find work? Being a clerk is not a dishonorable thing. Although the clothes we wear are a bit more fashionable, that is the boss's order. We eat his food, so we have to obey... Why don't they (referring to the writers) think from the beginning, and only satirize us pitiful people...?</p>
<p>She seemed to have forgotten that she was working as a clerk. We also forgot about buying leather shoes. Women are most easily moved by emotion, and we were just very sympathetic to her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bell rang on the neighboring table, giving her a miraculous reaction. She then picked up another pair of leather shoes.</p>
<p>"Miss, please try these on..."</p>

<h3 id="e217">Financial Swap Knocks Out Big Shorts, Gold Price Rises by 7.7 Yuan <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a swap deal. Bullish players aggressively pushed up prices, creating a premium. Short sellers became anxious and rushed to cover their positions. The situation soared upwards. Overseas dispatches frequently spread positive rumors, fueling the rise. Initially, overseas silver markets showed a slight increase in London and a decrease in the US. The Five Metals Exchange saw a slight rise in forward silver prices, while exchange rates contracted. London spot gold fell by one penny, US cotton fell by seven pounds, and US wheat saw a slight rise. Due to swap-related factors, there were rumors in the market about countries like Canada abolishing the silver standard. The opening was quite stable. After the opening, Reuters reported that the Goulbar proposal (suggesting that monetary authorities be allowed to buy and sell silver at a ratio of 371.25 silver to 23.22 gold) was scheduled for a vote next Tuesday. It also reported that after today's meeting of Congressmen Dies and Fessinger, the Speaker of the House would initiate a statement proposing to consolidate silver bills into a simpler proposal. These reports had no impact yet. Banks showed a tendency to accept. Reuters reported that the US Treasury Secretary declared that the fourth series of Liberty Bonds would be used to redeem silver. The US exchange rate was reduced by 0.125, and the gold price broke through 60 yuan, but still struggled. Later, large bullish players held firm and refused to let go. The swap premium continued to rise. Guangdong banks and general Western merchants, as well as speculators like Mr. Wu, scrambled to buy. Reuters reported from the New York Bank floor that President Roosevelt, after returning to Washington, was making every effort to resist the silver bill and trying to prevent its passage. At the same time, Wall Street had rumors that the Dies Silver Bill would be difficult to pass. Confidence surged, and the gold price rose further. The closing price continued to rise. The price of pure gold was calculated at 971.5 yuan. Tianjin goods flooded in. The swap premium in the market ranged from 5.3 to 8 yuan. The situation of the morning market is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 959.9 yuan, up 1.5 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 60 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 0.1875, and US exchange at 34.75 yuan. The Yokohama Specie Bank bought July US dollars at 0.125 and August at 0.25. Changsheng, Yongsheng, Dayi, and Dayong all advanced, rising from 9.8 yuan to 61.1 yuan. It was learned in advance that HSBC was quoting British exchange at par and US exchange down 0.125. Qianchang, Xiangyifeng, and Yong Zhaofeng unloaded, retreating to 0.03 yuan. The Bank of Communications Shanghai still bought August US dollars at 0.25 yuan. Hengyu advanced, and although Fuyu sold, the swap trend rose, so Hengxing, Yuanchang, and Yong also bought, rising to 2.1 yuan. Dingkang, Xiexing, Yongfuxing, Yong Dadecheng, and Zhifeng Yong sold, retreating to 1.1 yuan. Mitsui and Wahbi sold June US dollars at 35 yuan. However, with Yongde and Hengxing aggressively buying, the situation remained stable. After entering, the swap premium continued to rise, and the gold market also rose to over 2 yuan. There was news that the Dies Silver Bill might not pass. Yuanmao Yong Hengxing Yuanfeng Yong, etc., advanced to over 4 yuan. Confidence surged, and scattered shorts rushed to cover. Hengxing unloaded to cover shorts, reaching 6.1 yuan in one go. Zhifeng Yong, etc., sold within 5 yuan, but the force of short covering was fierce. Dadecheng Yuanchun Hengtai Richang all made large advances. The buying interest in the market was vigorous, and demand exceeded supply. The swap premium was aggressively bid up, rising to 6.4 yuan. The noon closing was 966.1 yuan, and goods were auctioned at 7.8 yuan. After the closing, although Yingfeng Heng sold aggressively, Yida Yong Yifeng Yong Yuanchang Yong Hui Xiang, etc., rushed to cover and rise. Finally, Hengyu and Zhifeng Yong accepted the tender, adding up to 8 yuan. The highest price for the half-day was 966.4 yuan, and the lowest was 959.8 yuan, a fluctuation of 6.6 yuan. As a result, it closed 7.7 yuan higher than the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price, due to HSBC's US exchange rate shrinking by 0.125 to 34.375 yuan, resulted in a benchmark gold price of 1006.54 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 40 yuan over the benchmark, a decrease of 4 yuan from the previous close. The registered price for this month was 967 yuan, for May 966 yuan, and for June 958 yuan. The morning water supplement was 967 yuan. The price of pure gold was 971.5 yuan, and the price of smelted gold was flat. Tianjin goods flooded in, and the market was more chaotic. The source of Tianjin goods flooded in, and futures also arrived quickly. Transactions gradually increased. The market price in the market ranged from 12 yuan, 10.75 yuan, 11.5 yuan to 11.25 yuan over the benchmark price, in a decreasing order, as the benchmark gold price repeatedly rose. It is estimated that Tianjin banks sold approximately 16,000 taels in total to Yingfeng Heng Tongfeng Yong Tai Kang Run, etc. In addition, approximately 1,000 taels of Eastern goods were traded at 10 to 11 yuan over the benchmark. 161 notes for this month remain.</p>
<p>In market transactions, buying accounts surged. In summary, Hengxing Shengda Fuxing Yong Tongtai Chang Tongtai Yicheng Qianchang Xiang Yuanmao Yong Yuanchun Hongxing Futai Heng Chang Shengyong Huiyuan Hui Xiang Yongde, etc., were on the buying side. Yingfeng Heng Hengchang Yong Yifeng Yong Hengyu Dafa Yong Bingxing Zhaofeng Chang Fuyu Yuanheng Dadecheng Hongkang Yong Zhifeng Yong Tongfeng Yong Qingfa Yong Fuchang, etc., were on the selling side. Xiexing Yong Yida Yong advanced and retreated later. Dalian Bank Wanxing traded a total of over 500, with over 100 rolled out, over 100 advanced, and over 600 retired. Guangdong Bank Hengxing advanced a total of over 2,300. Shengda advanced a total of over 900. The total number of May transactions that day was 77,805.</p>
<p>As of today, those who have not settled the May notes, bullish positions include Qianchangxiang with over 4,700, Yuan with over 1,290, Qingfa Yong with over 1,300, Shengda with over 500, Hengxingyuan with 420, and Tongchun Dadecheng with over 300 each. Bearish positions include Yingfengheng with over 2,700, Yuqing Yong with over 1,000, Shunli with over 900, Tongfengheng Fuyu Huiyuan with over 600 each, Huixiang with over 500, and Yicheng Yuanmao Yong Tianfeng Zhifeng Yong with over 400 each, Ruikang Dafengheng with over 300 each. In total, there are 19 bullish firms and 41 bearish firms. The total number of chips remaining is 11,788.</p>
<p>The swap opened in the morning at a buyer's premium of around 5 yuan. Although Dadecheng and Qianchangxiang made swap advances, Shengda, Dalian Bank, Yingfengheng Dingtai Run Chang Yu Dadecheng Hengyu, etc., swapped out bullish positions, retreating to 4.3 to 4.4 yuan. Yuqing Yong Qianchangxiang Yuanchang Yong Chang Shengyong Xiexing Yong Dadecheng Zhaofeng Chang Ruixing Hengxing posted premiums, gradually returning to over 5 yuan. Hengxing bravely posted premiums, and the official opening became a buyer's premium of 5.5 yuan. Zhengchang, etc., worked hard to swap advances, and the price rose to 6 yuan. Yingfeng Heng Fuyu Dalian Bank, etc., posted premiums, and the price retreated to 5.3 yuan again. Zhifeng Yong posted premiums at the beginning, rising to over 6 yuan, but mistakenly made swap deals, repeatedly posting premiums, once falling to 5.5 yuan. Bingxing Yida Yong Hengyu, etc., posted premiums but remained stable. After entering, bullish players held firm, and short sellers urgently sought counterparts. Bingxing Hengyu Zhifeng Yong Hengchang Yong Tianfeng Yingfeng Heng Yuqing Yong Fuchang Yuan, etc., continuously posted premiums, and the premium gradually rose. By the closing, it had risen to 8 yuan. The market continued to rise to 8.5 yuan after the closing. Dalian Bank and Yingfengheng swapped out bullish positions at the beginning and retreated slightly. It can be seen that bullish forces are united, such as Qianchangxiang owning over 4,700 and Yuan with 3,000 weak positions. The trend seems firm, but the rapid arrival of goods cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The new lineup for the June period includes Shunli with over 2,200, Wanxing with over 1,800, Yingfengheng with over 1,700, Shengda Run Changyu with over 900 each, Yuanchun with over 800, Da Changxiang Yuanmao Yong Tongfengheng with over 700 each, Run Chang Yong Zhifeng Yong Tongchun with over 500 each.

Copper coins were unchanged, still at 323,500 wen, with 36,879 strings of wen traded, calculated at a price of 11,400 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Securities: Northern Banks Cover Shorts, Large Players Turn Bullish, Bond Market Thrives <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the floor of the Chinese Securities Exchange tightened sharply. Initially, Northern banks covered shorts, and then large short players turned bullish. Retail short players also increased their positions, and the situation suddenly turned good. There are faint whispers that traffic and postal services were being resolved, and that hearts were steadfast, and the bullish position became dominant. Nine Six was also purchased by financial institutions, pushing up the price. There was also rumor that it would be organized. The future situation may see increased prices. Yesterday's price movement trended upward all day. Only one or two opened slightly lower by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, showing that the market started unsteadily but the uptrend was strong. The afternoon market was even stronger, with large players such as numbers 11, 14, 43 and 48 buying in, especially numbers 11 and 43. Number 41 also aggressively bought Nine Six, and the bullish trend increased. There was no sign of weakness at the close, with prices up by 0.2 to 0.4 yuan. Given the situation in North China, the situation does not seem likely to worsen, and the standards of the long and short sides are becoming clear. The short side has lost its basis and must painfully liquidate. Even if there is a downturn, it will be short-lived. The settlement date is approaching, and there is still a risk of infighting. Yesterday, all prices rose from 0.2 to 0.9 yuan. Prices are roughly the same as before the holiday, and some have already exceeded that. The total number of transactions was 16,685,400 yuan, with 4,000 yuan in spot and 16,685,000 yuan in futures. The high, low and rise and fall are compared in the table below.

<h3 id="e222">New York Stock Market Stagnant <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday's stock market was still stagnant and mixed, unable to break the consolidation. The major stocks lingered around the previous day's closing price, but some preferred stocks, such as American Sugar, rose significantly. The stagnation is caused by: 1) the future of exchange management is still uncertain; 2) to avoid outside criticism, the authorities are strictly cracking down on speculators manipulating the market. Bonds were mixed, with some speculative bonds being closed out, while high-grade bonds took the lead in the market. U.S. government bonds climbed to a new high for the year. The small exchange was mixed and slightly higher. New York agents report: (securities) lacked excitement, traders were uninterested, waiting for developments in Washington; (wheat) bulls continued to sell off, Washington news was slightly better, and it was possible to buy in when prices fell; (cotton) the market was loose because it was reported that the Penk He case against exceeding the cotton quota would be taxed at 50% when sold, and all parties have agreed. The possibility of inflation provided support, but there seemed to be a long-term conflict between the government and Congress, and the proposal to increase income tax also caused anxiety. Factory purchases totaled 173,000 bales; (silver) Senate Speaker Renner claimed that silver legislation would be passed by this Congress. The market closed firmer. The total volume for the day was 1.18 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>New low of 163.7</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to fall. The factories held a meeting yesterday, the contents of which were kept secret. According to some sources, the meeting did not produce any significant results, so sellers became more active and the market weakened. The May futures broke through the 70 yuan mark twice. The yarn market is extremely pessimistic.</p>
<p>(Yarn bidding continued to decline) The yarn bidding market opened well, but selling resumed after the second or third round of bidding. Prices fell by 1.3 to 1.6 yuan for each month. In the afternoon, this month's yarn was even weaker, with the low price reaching 163.7 yuan. Prices for each month fell by 0.9 to 1 yuan. The total number of transactions for the day was 44,700 bales. Sui Long sold 4,900 bales, Mei Ji 1,350 bales, Ming De 1,000 bales, Yuan De 900 bales, Heng De 900 bales, and Rui Da 850 bales. Heng Chang bought 1,500 bales, Da Feng 1,850 bales, Yuan Da 1,750 bales, Chang Feng 1,900 bales, and De Ji 700 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>(Spot Yarn Sales Are Weak) Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Total purchases by all brokers for the day were only 372 bales.</p>
<p>The market fell by 0.5 yuan. Purchases by all brokers are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 110 Luzhou 8 Ningbo Same Trade 5</p>
<p>Guangdong 115 Northern Trade 121 Zhenjiang 8</p>

<p>After a period of sluggishness, the cotton market suddenly rebounded, showing strong momentum. This was driven by rising Indian cotton prices, leading Yongbo merchants to make significant purchases in Shanghai. Simultaneously, there were rumors of cotton merchants forming bullish consortia, which further strengthened buying sentiment in the market. Speculators who had short positions were spurred into action to cover their losses, causing a sharp rise in prices, creating an inverse relationship with the yarn market.</p>
<p>The future of the cotton market is becoming increasingly difficult to predict.</p>
<p>(Report by Zheng Biaofu) The spot cotton market opened flat due to the poor performance of the yarn market. During the second and third rounds of trading, Yongbo merchants absorbed large quantities, pushing prices up by 0.22-0.34 yuan per dan for various months. In the afternoon, long positions were liquidated, causing prices to fall by 0.05-0.12 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 110,100 dan. Sales included 7,500 dan from Changhe, 2,400 dan from Tongji, 2,100 dan from Dafeng, 3,100 dan from Yuanda, 3,000 dan from Gengfeng, 4,000 dan from Changji, 1,300 dan from Tongxing, and 1,300 dan from Mingde. Purchases included 7,600 dan from Changfeng, 1,700 dan from Yuanxingchang, 3,200 dan from Yicheng, 4,300 dan from Xiesheng, 2,700 dan from Xinheng, and 2,800 dan from Dachangcheng. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton: Highest Price, Lowest Price, Closing Price, Change, Open Interest</p>
<p>April Contract: 41.55, 41.00, 41.40, Up 0.35, 103,300</p>

<p>Total: 658,900</p>
<p>(Declining Raw Cotton Consumption) Raw cotton consumption has become sluggish again. Sources included 398 bales of Yaohua cotton and 185 bales of Tonghua cotton. Current spot cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton: 38.00 yuan, 300 bales of Dongmian Bank cotton shipped to Dakang.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market initially rose due to buying by traders, but later fell back due to profit-taking and political factors favoring short positions. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points (British currency unit), and futures fell by 6 to 9 points. Liverpool spot cotton fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 5 to 8 points. Egyptian spot cotton fell by 10 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to speculative buying, but fell back due to selling by Japanese traders. Ultimately, Pingar rose by 1 rupee, Omra rose by 2 rupees, and Bai Luoqi rose by 1.5 rupees. (Report from the 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e226">Grain and Flour Futures Market Quiet and Sluggish <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally quiet and sluggish after opening in the morning. The quoted prices for foreign wheat in Chicago were around 48 points, and Canadian wheat was also around 48 points. Therefore, due to the flat trends abroad, there was very little actual buying or selling activity in the market, and the market lacked vitality. This situation is unique to the exchange market. The afternoon session remained quiet, with the most activity in the current month's contract, which fell to a low of 7.75 fen, but was supported by some factory purchases and stabilized. As a result, April and May contracts fell slightly by 2.5 li, June and July contracts remained unchanged, August contracts fell slightly by 2.5 li, and September contracts remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Near-Term Stability and Long-Term Flatness in Wheat Futures <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed near-term stability and long-term flatness in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The current month's contract was supported by strong spot wheat prices, and buyers were unwilling to sell. The June contract, being a new wheat contract with favorable weather conditions, was soft, opening lower by 3 fen, and remained unchanged thereafter. The July contract fluctuated without much change, while the August contract was quiet, ultimately falling by only 1 fen. This situation is expected to change significantly only after the new wheat crop is close to harvest. The spot wheat market remained active, with flexible factory demand pushing prices up by 2 to 3 fen. Kaoyao Bay wheat traded at 3.52 yuan, Tengxian wheat at 3.59 yuan, Dangshan wheat at 3.57 yuan, Taierzhuang wheat at 3.65 yuan (second-grade at 3.57 yuan), and Suqian wheat at 3.53 yuan, totaling 5,000 bags, with Fuxin purchasing 4,000 bags and Huafeng purchasing 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Tight Supply of Mid-Grade and Lower-Grade Xiang Rice <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Xiang rice market saw active demand from Fujian and Zhejiang merchants, especially from Fujian, suggesting a potential price increase. However, sporadic shipments continued, including a ship loaded with rice directly from Changsha to Shanghai, which had already arrived and was unloading at Yichang Wharf. Therefore, prices did not rise. However, due to the strong demand from Fujian merchants for mid-grade and lower-grade rice, these grades were in relatively tight supply, while higher-grade rice remained stable. A total of over 3,000 bags of rice were offered in the market, with Xiang rice accounting for half. The main buyers were Fujian merchants, with less than 1,000 bags going to local and Wenzhou merchants. Northern merchants were interested in Jiyuan rice, but the supply from the river was limited and lacked selection. The quality of Keyuan rice was deteriorating.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Three Thousand Bags of Late Rice Sold <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the supply from various regions was slightly larger, with a total of 16 or 17 ships arriving with late rice, 15 or 16 ships with thick japonica rice and various colored varieties, totaling over 5,000 shi. The market was active, with Nanyang merchants, seeing the limited arrivals, fearing a missed opportunity, competing to buy mid-grade late rice from Zhongguan. Sellers raised prices, and Beiyang merchants began to purchase ordinary, high-grade, and special-grade rice, quickly selling out their remaining inventory. The market showed signs of recovery. However, with continued arrivals, Hakka merchants retreated, causing a slight setback. The market recovered around noon, with shipments ceasing. It was estimated that Nanyang and Beiyang merchants purchased nearly 3,000 bags of Qingjiao, Song, Si, Fengjing, Xijing, and Lian rice. Prices for high-grade rice rose slightly by 0.02-0.03 yuan, while mid-grade and lower-grade rice rose by 0.05 yuan. The prices of thick japonica rice from Changbang, Suguan, and Nangang remained unchanged. The price of Du Yangjian Yinbian Yuan also did not change. (Shanghai North) Yesterday, 45-46 ships arrived from the river. Sales of white japonica rice, Yinbian Yuan, and Du Jian were poor, while Yang Jian and Bu Jian were relatively active. Early thin rice and Yin Yuan were average. Prices for white japonica rice, Yinbian Yuan, and early thin rice fell by 0.05-0.06 yuan. The remaining goods were sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Zhongguan Soybeans Particularly Popular <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market remained tight. While the overall soybean market stabilized, Zhongguan soybeans remained highly sought after due to strong factory demand, with prices rising by another 0.02-0.03 yuan. Three truckloads of Zhengyangguan soybeans were traded, with prices ranging from 2.74 to 2.77 yuan. One truckload of Feihe soybeans was offered at 2.68 yuan. Four truckloads of Yingzhou soybeans were offered at 2.65 yuan. Three truckloads of Suixikou soybeans were offered at 2.60 yuan. 1,400 bags of Xuzhou soybeans were offered at 2.70 yuan. 1,200-1,300 bags of Guide soybeans were offered at 2.70 yuan and 2.69 yuan. Buyers were mainly factories and local merchants from the inland region.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Dried Fruits and Seeds Trended Towards Weakness and Decline <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Despite limited arrivals of dried longan meat, sluggish sales led to a weaker market. Current prices are around 72 yuan for Xiamen's fresh sundried longan meat and 93-94 yuan for Shima's fresh sundried longan meat. Runan's new dried longan meat traded at 44-45 yuan, with sluggish trading activity.</p>
<p>Due to a prolonged shortage of high-grade lotus seeds, prices had once risen to 48 yuan. However, with increasing arrivals and inferior color and quality, demand was weak. Current prices for ordinary high-grade lotus seeds are around 36-37 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Active Trade in Smuggled Artificial Silk and Tea <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that the recent trade in artificial silk has been dominated by smuggled goods. Factories and importers are using these goods because of their low prices. Smuggled Italian silk is shipped from Hong Kong and sold through Guangdong merchants, while smuggled Japanese silk from Shandong is sold through Zhilu merchants. Yesterday (the 14th), about 50 boxes were traded, with Japanese goods accounting for the majority. Prices are as follows: Italian silk (Talon Siyi Ai) (150) No. 3: 405 yuan, No. 4: 395 yuan, (120) No. 3: 375 yuan, No. 4: 370 yuan. Japanese silk (Beauty Tianqiao) (150) No. 1: 395 yuan, (120) No. 1: 375 yuan.</p>

<p>Lead prices continued to soar yesterday, with prices reaching 15.25 yuan per dan, while the supply of spot goods was extremely scarce, further bolstering market confidence and driving prices higher. Various tea merchants, as well as merchants from Yantai and Tianjin, continued to purchase lead, with transaction volumes reaching 700-800 bars. Local printing houses and type foundries also made some purchases, creating a very optimistic market outlook.</p>

<p>— Bao Yu</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you know the meaning of effort? Effort is using your strength to do what you should do.</p>
<p>Little friends! Have you heard the story of the tortoise and the hare race? The tortoise walked very slowly, but it was willing to work hard, so it won. The hare ran very fast, but it was unwilling to work hard and fell asleep on the way; as a result, it failed!</p>
<p>In school, don't you often see that some students do well in their studies, and some students don't? The reason is that one is willing to work hard, and the other is not. There are many people in the world who are like hares, starting out with great effort, but later becoming unwilling to work hard. They fail! There are also very few people who are able to keep working hard, so they succeed!</p>
<p>Little friends! If you are willing to move forward diligently like a tortoise, your future will be very promising.</p>
<p>Little friends! Don't you always hope that your studies will improve day by day? Don't you admire great people? I tell you, if you want to realize your hopes, you only need to work hard to move forward.</p>
<h3 id="e235">The Law of the Jungle <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Wei</p>
<p>The law of the jungle, where the weak are prey to the strong, is a natural principle. Big fish eat small fish, which is an inevitable fact. There is nothing controversial about it.</p>
<p>A big fish was chasing a small fish in the river. The small fish said, "Don't be so cruel, I am your kin!" "Kin? Now there are only two paths to take: the first is that I eat you, and the second is that you eat me." The small fish sighed at the size of its own body and said, "Then, please eat me!"</p>
<p>But, little friends! Please don't be afraid. Adults will never eat children, because you have loving parents to protect you, and you have national armies to defend you. However, if you ever leave the embrace of your parents, or leave the borders of your country, you will never have the same happy life as you do now.</p>
<p>Little friends! Before you leave your parents or your country, you should quickly study hard and strengthen your physique; otherwise, if you encounter someone stronger, you will not be able to defeat them, and they will harm you.</p>
<h3 id="e236">A Proverb <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— You Ji</p>
<p>Little friends, I will tell you a proverb, a very meaningful proverb.</p>
<p>It is a Western proverb, and that proverb says: "Nothing will fall into the mouth of a sleeping fox." Little friends, this is a very true statement. Think about it, a sleeping fox's mouth is always closed, right? Then, even if something falls from above, it will not fall into its mouth. Moreover, there is not necessarily anything falling from above. Even if something does fall from above, and the sleeping fox's mouth is open, how can it be certain that the thing will fall into its mouth? So the proverb says that nothing will fall into the mouth of a sleeping fox, and that is true.</p>
<p>But why is it said to be a meaningful proverb? Originally, that proverb contains a kind of lesson. That lesson is that lazy people will never get anything. You see, the sleeping fox is lazy, isn't it? How can it get something to fall into its mouth if it doesn't move?</p>
<p>Little friends, you must not be lazy, you must be diligent, you must be diligent in studying, you must be diligent in cleaning, and you must be diligent in all good things. If you are diligent, your knowledge will improve, your body will be healthy, and you will get endless happiness.</p>

<p>Do you do bamboo carving in your school? When scraping off the "bamboo green" layer from the surface of the bamboo, isn't it easy to damage the blade if you use a knife? You can use "broken glass" to scrape it, using its sharp edge to scrape off the "bamboo green." It is not only faster but also smoother than scraping with a knife.</p>
<p>Waste Paper Torn from the Calendar</p>

<p>Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>I can't bear the desolation and loneliness of the frontier;</p>
<p>I flap my wings,</p>
<p>And fly over the mountains.</p>
<p>Fly, fly, fly,</p>
<p>South to the motherland.</p>
<p>I don't want to be a slave of a conquered nation anymore!</p>
<p>Fly, fly, fly,</p>

<p>Never mind hunger and thirst,</p>
<p>I scream with my throat,</p>
<p>To shatter the illusions of those who are complacent!</p>

<p>— Zhang Nancun</p>
<p>On Sunday, Min'er's father took him to Shanghai City God Temple. There were many children's toys for sale. Min'er had heard his teacher say that Japanese children's toys had always sold very well. Min'er saw many toys for sale and couldn't tell if they were Japanese or Chinese, so he didn't want to buy any of them. Later, he saw foreign mice for sale in a bird shop. Those foreign mice were climbing on a merry-go-round in a glass cage. Min'er thought it was very fun and said to his father, "Should we buy one and take it home to play with?" His father smiled and said to him, "You said you wouldn't buy foreign goods, aren't these foreign mice foreign goods?" Min'er held his father's hand, pulled him away, and said, "I will absolutely not buy foreign goods. I don't want these foreign mice, let's go!" His father saw how patriotic he was and thought he was very cute, so he said, "Although they are called foreign mice, they are actually raised and sold by Chinese people, not imported goods. You can buy them. I was just joking, don't misunderstand." So he bought two foreign mice and a glass cage for the mice to climb on, and when he went back, he also bought a Chinese paper lantern.</p>
<p>In the evening, Min'er saw the foreign mice climbing on the merry-go-round, and also held the lighted lantern in his hand, he was so happy that he wrote a foreign mice song and a lantern song, and sang them happily. His two children's songs are written below.</p>
<p>Foreign Mice</p>
<p>Foreign mice, red eyes, climbing on the merry-go-round, their feet never stop. They eat white rice and also work, better than lazy and naughty students.</p>
<p>Light the Lantern</p>
<p>In the New Year, light the lantern. Light the lantern and let it shine brightly. The lantern leads me on a bright path, do not enter a wrong path and ruin your life.</p>

<p>(1) British brick house, (2) House of the Bolivian natives of South America, built with mud and branches, (3) House of the Lapp people, built with grass and soil, (4) Mud house of the Cameroonians, (5) House of the Maori people (residents of New Zealand), with human heads and other pictures painted on the pillars, (6) Small house of North American Indians, covered with bark, straw mats, or animal skins on the pillars, (7) House of the Vietnamese, built on wooden piles, (8) House of the Australians, built with branches, (9) Japanese paper house, (10) Tree house of the Mindanao people, (11) Grass house of the Hoshars, (12) Snow house of the Eskimos, (13) Wooden house of Russian peasants.</p>
<p>The houses that various ethnic groups in the world live in, like the clothes they wear, also have great differences. Because of the different climates and building materials, the forms of their houses are also very different. For example, the houses of the Eskimos living in the Arctic are built with snow blocks because snow blocks are the easiest building materials for them to obtain in winter. Russian peasants use wood to build houses because they live near large forests. In places where floods often occur, houses are often built on wooden piles or trees to prevent floods. In tropical regions like Africa, most of the houses are built with grass or mud, because there is plenty of grass and mud in the tropics. But in culturally developed places, the residences of the residents are mostly built with bricks and stones, and not much with local materials, such as mud and grass. The more developed the culture, the more solid and exquisite the architecture of the residence, which is the universal rule of the world.</p>

<p>The bell had been ringing for a long time, and Xu Bingsheng hurried in from outside the door with his schoolbag in his arms. Xu Bingsheng's face was obviously full of panic.</p>
<p>"Why are you so late?" the teacher asked. "Because our dishes were not cooked well today," Xu Bingsheng replied.</p>
<p>"So you argued with your family because the dishes were not cooked well? And therefore you were late?"</p>
<p>Xu Bingsheng said calmly, "No! Because the dishes were not cooked well, I couldn't eat."</p>
<p>The teacher felt even more strange. "Since you couldn't eat, then you should have come earlier."</p>
<p>"Teacher! Don't you understand? Because I couldn't eat, I couldn't walk!"</p>
<p>The students looked at each other and laughed, and the teacher also laughed.</p>

<p>— Yu Bailu</p>
<p>(1) Unity is Strength</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was an old man who had five sons. They were not harmonious and fought every day. Although he repeatedly advised them, nothing worked. One day, he thought of a way. He took a bundle of chopsticks and asked them to break it in turn, but the chopsticks were so tightly bound that they couldn't be broken no matter how hard they tried. After a while, he unbound the chopsticks and gave them to them one by one to break. Then, they broke them easily. Therefore, he taught them, "My children, you must always grasp the strength of unity! If you can unite together, no enemy can harm you. At the same time, if you are scattered by fighting, then any enemy can harm you!"</p>
<p>(2) Virtue Will Receive Equal Reward</p>
<p>A thirsty ant went to a small spring to drink water, ran too fast, and was washed into the water by the spring. A flying dove saw it and felt sorry for it, so it held a leaf in its beak and put it next to it. It was rescued, climbed onto the leaf, and when the leaf flowed near the spring, it quietly climbed onto the shore again. Not long after, this dove was seen by a hunter in the forest. Just as he was aiming his gun at it, the ant happened to be next to the hunter's foot, so he quickly stung the hunter's foot. The hunter was hit in the dark, but the dove escaped.</p>

<p>— Ning Ziqiang</p>
<p>Little friends, in this warm and sunny weather, do you still remember the fun of flying kites? I think all of you little friends will not forget, and you will definitely remember to play this game on Sundays or holidays.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of kites: fish, birds, old men, centipedes, everything that should be here, not everything. They are called paper kites because someone installs a bowstring on them. The wind excites the string, so they are also called kites.</p>
<p>Little friends, do you also know the inventor of electricity, the American Benjamin Franklin? Originally, when he was taking the kite, there was thunder and rain in the sky. He used a copper key and hung it on the kite string. At the same time, he saw the key flashing brightly. So he felt that metal had the effect of inducing current, so he became an inventor in the electrical world.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a man who sold honey. One day, he was carrying a load of honey to sell when he suddenly slipped and dropped the honey. He was very heartbroken, so he rolled around in the honey, getting honey all over his body. Because he was tired from rolling around, he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Many monkeys came and saw a person sleeping on the ground. They licked him with their tongues and found him very sweet. So they carried him home and treated him like a sweet Buddha, and they also brought many good things to offer him.</p>
<p>Later, the monkeys went out, and he woke up. Seeing so many things, he happily took them home and ate them.</p>

<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>If little friends go to the zoo to play, when you come back, you will definitely have a kind of feeling, that is, which of the fierce and huge beasts has the strongest force? Which animal is the fiercest? Animals all have their own self-confident power. For example, when a lion encounters a strong member of the same species, it will show an angry face, perk up its spirits, tense its muscles, and reveal its sharp teeth, side by side, opening its jaws, showing a self-confident and fierce appearance. The lion is the king of beasts. With one swipe of its front limbs, cattle, deer, zebras, etc., will fall to the ground and die. "The vibration of its tail is an expression that it wants to kill people." Orangutans often fight crocodiles and large snakes in the forest or by the river. With its powerful arms, it can pull the crocodile's upper and lower jaws apart. It opens its mouth and bites the crocodile's throat to pieces. If the snake wraps around its body, it can bite the snake in the middle. The hippopotamus is the largest in the animal world. It is 15 feet long, weighs 4 tons, and is shaped like a barrel. Its mouth is wide and large. The boats that the natives hang are often swallowed by it, and even small ships can be dragged to the bottom of the water by it. The elephant is smaller than the hippopotamus. African giant elephants are up to 11.85 feet tall, and Indian elephants are also 10.5 feet tall. In ancient Rome, the elephant's great strength was often used for warfare. The natives of Ceylon ordered several elephants to work together to pull up trees that were 30 feet high and five feet in circumference. Its nose can break thick branches with a single curl. The African ape can kill a giant elephant with two fists. As for birds, the strongest is the ostrich, followed by the cassowary. Although these large birds cannot fly high, they walk faster than other winged birds. They use their long legs and sharp claws as weapons. If we are slapped by it, it will be difficult for us to survive.</p>

<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>Dear Little Friends;</p>
<p>Ah! How great is the authority of spring! Those melancholy and depressed willows, nourished by warm, soup-like sweet dew, caressed by a furnace-like sun, are actually dancing gracefully! The little birds, stretching their necks, sing melodious and clear songs, and many of us little friends greet them.</p>
<p>The wheat in the fields bows in welcome as a gentle breeze blows. The little grasses secretly reveal their tips, but the rapeseed smiles. Does it mark many crosses, or is it the spirit of Jesus?</p>
<p>Many little friends, in twos and threes, are searching for artemisia and alfalfa in the fields. One basket, two baskets, they take them home, and their parents smile. Sometimes they even take them to the market towns to sell, each basket for four or five copper coins. These little friends happily save up the money. It is a pity that they don't have the opportunity to go to school. But they often go to nearby schools to play on the slides, seesaws, and small swings...</p>
<p>Friends! We are people who have many opportunities to study. How can we relax? Let's work hard! Taking advantage of the bright and beautiful springtime.</p>
