<h3 id="c22">發展中國經濟須賴集體力量愼 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>上海號稱我國的經濟中心。不用講就是中國繁榮的表現。但是自世界經濟恐慌次第開展以後上海也同受嚴重影響。這種影響。在一二八戰爭後。始逐漸明顯。特别是去年下季以來。竟有難於撑持之勢。近來一般表現最明顯的是。（一）商店倒閉。日漸增加。很多有基礎的大商號。亦有不能不出於清理之一途。（二）産業經營。非常困難。特别是絲廠。能繼續開工的不及十分之一。（三）金融業感着流通遲緩。却又不能不愼重放欵。因此商業界更感困難。愈顯出市面的衰退。以上三種的形勢。長此推移可使失業人數增加。一般生活。更見窘迫。於是反映到商工業和金融業的市面。就越見嚴重。</p>
<p>原來上海的發達就資本主義組織而論。也不是自然的現象。因爲像這樣大都市的發達。應該以産業發達爲中心。國民經濟方有基礎然而上海的發達誰都知是進出口貿易居首位。進口的大多數是工業製品出口的多半是原料。近來又發生一種特殊的轉變糧食麵粉。竟作了進口貨物的大宗。如此大都市的發達依託在倚人爲活的買賣轉換上面這是何等的危險事。都市如靠商業發達。有兩種危險第一是進口方面主動力。强半握在别人手裏。自己毫無主持的權能。何况自海禁開後。我國内地的交通由水上航路以至於鐵道。都由外人從中操縱假如世界經濟恐慌難於彌補的話。則我是最後的犧牲者。第二。在出口方面更要聽人家支配。因爲自己製造力低落的原故。對海外貿易也同操諸他人之手。非特不能擴張海外市塲。而且還要受人排擠。生絲與絲織品的銷路。爲日本製品所侵奪。就是明證。更加以外國資本的對華投資。從交通工業織維工業。到政治借欵文化投資等。償付債務利息的支出。何嘗不可使整個中國經濟陷於險境。所以賴商業爲基礎的上海。畸形的繁榮。在目前這樣形勢之下。其受經濟恐慌的影響。較先進諸國更加厲害要圖挽。救或暫時穩定。比有工業基礎的國家更見費力。</p>
<p>就我國上海和一般城市所表現的經濟狀况觀察。這並不是一時的現象。更不是過了多少時期就可恢復的。因爲現在這樣的經濟衰落。根本上是經濟組織自身先天帶來的矛盾又是從最基本的農村經濟頽廢推演而來。所以最大多數的人。從鄉村的農人到城市的中小工商業者。莫不同陷於生活窘迫之中。找不到適當的出路。且還有外來的壓迫。資本主義各國。都想借這塊市塲重新發展。求他們自己的經濟平衡。於是我國國民經濟的復興。就更加困難了。</p>
<p>不過我們還有一綫的生機是。我們還有很多没有開發的地方。我們還埋有無盡藏的鑛物。我們國内的市塲祇要一般人生活略有餘裕。消費力就會自然增高我們的農業誠然不能再就手工業的形態去發展。但是稍加機械力的補充。就會進一步的希冀巨大收穫。我們的水上交通和鐵道。都儘有發展的地盤。一般社會又正待着接受這種發展。並且都願意在發展中努力。其所以不能卽刻實現的原因在政治上尙未到完全穩定的時候私人經營。仍舊難於開始。並且多數人祇圖維持現狀。至於用國家權力來實行統制經濟。則一切凖備工作。都還没有着手。當然一時難於見諸實施現在要求工業與農村平衡發展。又要顧慮到對外關係。個人的能力。在歐美先進諸國且有所不能。在我們中國。自然更非用集體的力量不可。集體經濟的發展。統籌工業與農業經濟的平衡。整個的計劃。固然不可少。而發揮有效能的集體的實施。更是當務之急。</p>

<p>墨氏論及外交、謂奥可依賴意國維持其獨立、並襄助其經濟改良、而意國與南斯拉夫亦可於環境適當時改善其關係、至於意法間之懸案、雖尚未有趨向於解决之實在進步、但兩國邦交固常有起色也、國聯之改革繫於軍縮會議之結局、苟此會議失敗、則國聯無庸改造、因軍縮失敗亦足爲國聯壽終之訃告也、武裝之國如不解除其武裝、則當然不能反對實施一九三二年給于德國之平等權云、</p>

<p>（巴黎）　墨索里尼之演說、法報表示驚異、法報對於三國公約固不反對、但認意相關於凡爾賽和約之言論、有極力主張修約之意、而其所抱意法諒解之希望亦屬徒然、巴黎日報謂墨氏發言似儼然欲以一言爲天下法者、小巴黎人報謂墨氏議論將造成擾攘空氣與失望情感、菲加魯報謂法國已努力諒解意國之立塲、但墨氏言論中未有對法諒解之表示云、（十九日路透電）</p>

<p>英日商業觀點各異</p>
<p>競爭焦點在乎市塲</p>
<p>輸出同是棉紗棉布</p>
<p>衝突爲奪實際利益</p>
<p>英國原來是一個靠利息收入·居金融支配者地位的國家、所以英國本國、儘管年年有形貿易輸入超過、儘管工業組織不及德國的新頴·美國的敏銳、但還仍舊可以保持着舊有的風格、紳士的態度、因其海外投資、已足以左右她的國運、並可左右世界的經濟也、不過自歐洲大戰以還、美國不但追上了她、而且有趕過她的趨勢三　其是一九三九年世界經濟恐慌發生後、一般債務國家、都漸次不能保持信用、歐洲的國家如德如奥、幾乎陷於破産、南美諸國如巴西·如阿根廷等、償還外資利息、旣不得不延期、新的投資、自然更擺不下去、而殖民地自治領諸國、又都陷於經濟恐慌的狂潮中、有自求解放的趨向、於是乎英國貿易的無形輸入、就非常衰落、這影響於英國國民經濟就很大了、</p>
<p>從前不很依靠製造品輪出貿易來塡補國際收支平衡的英國、現在也痛感必要了、何况她尙要輸入糧食·原料、這些日常生活上、産業經營上所必不缺少的東西、假如英國再不注意到輸出問題、則國民經濟的前途、眞是有些危險因此自前年渥太華帝國經濟會議後、卽漸次形成英帝國以内的經濟聯盟、帶着極其濃厚的保護貿易的色彩了、這種舉動、與世界的一般經濟關係、固然重要、而與日本的影響、尤其嚴重、因爲英國雖然號稱工業先進國家、其重工業的地位、反不及棉布那樣重要、日本這個新進的工業國、又正是以棉紗棉布爲輸出第二大宗的、不但在遠東市塲上、已成爲太平洋西岸的覇者、卽英領印度、馬來·埃及·等屬於英帝國勢力範圍的市塲、都有日本的棉製品和人造絲製品侵進來、不特是侵進來而已、并且駕英國而上之、英國的織維製品、大有爲日本製品驅逐之虞、所以去年的印日會議、到年底纔告一段落、</p>
<p>但是英日兩國間爭鬥的因素、并没有除去、而且還有繼續惡化的傾向、若眞是任這樣自然的醖釀下去、則英國去年一年中在印度·埃及·南非·馬來·澳洲·等地方所發布的抵制日本的辦法、還要更加厲害、英日關係還要惡化、不過我們知道英國是善於觀察國際形勢、運用外交手腕、以鞏固自己利益的、她知道這時候不必同日本决裂、并且也没有决裂的必要、所以她還是採用她的外交辦法與日本會商、</p>
<p>先由民間紡織工業界的代表會議、商量出比較具體的辦法來、是更妥當些、於是乎英日民間通商會議代表、於二月十四在英國商務部作第一次會議了、英國方面的代表、是巴洛·密爾士·葛雷·克勒亞·李士·多木生·五人、人造絲工業的代表、爲威廉、斯畢爾曼·二人、此外還有經濟顧問許斯、任書記的斯特里特·恩茲勒·再由商務部派商務總長蘭西曼·與海外貿易局長柯爾維爾出席、英國方面出席、的人、計有十二個、日本方面的代表、棉業爲岡田·三宅·三村·川口·玉垣·五人、人造絲工業代表、則爲島田、計六個人出席、</p>
<p>將來會議的結果、究竟何如、現在固然難於推測、不過她們雙方都各有成見、在英國方面的、（一）棉布和人造絲製品的輸出、該以一九三一年以前爲標凖、（二）對市塲輸出的恊定、要着眼於全界的輸出爲比例、（三）近年來日本織維品輸出激增、此後該顧慮到世界情形、略受限制、在日本方面的意見、（一）恊定輸出數量、該以一九三三年爲基凖、（二）英國本國和英國自治領殖民地要在市塲恊定之外、另行談判、（三）英日以外的第三國市塲、也須在恊定以外談判、</p>
<p>這樣的各執所見、是否能順利進行、就可以想見的了、（一九三四年二月十二日）</p>

<p>民族精神不死</p>
<p>鬭爭異常激劇</p>
<p>飯塚大佐陣亡</p>
<p>二百日兵覆没</p>
<p>傀儡受命登臺、在重重壓迫底下的東北人民、那個敢作聲、含着眼淚也祗好向肚裏嚥下去、缺乏堅强組織的羣衆、又處在農業與工業轉換的狂流當中、有抵抗力而决心抵抗的究竟是少數、在這些少數中、有一部分人、却不免供民族鬭爭的義勇軍運動、便其個人的私圖、因此就發生過些不規則的行爲、致引起一般人民的反感、憤激而投效敵人、也是有的、現在人家的根基、漸次穩固了、從前所說的那些謊話、都一句一句自行打破了、所謂「王道樂土」、眞成「亡道黑土」了、東北的人民、自然有一部分還迷戀着眼前、守着他自己的些微財産、冀圖苟活、但是漸次要活不下去了、捐稅之重、差不多比從前增加兩倍、農産物品、還是賣不出去、例如每餵十隻鷄、就要年納稅一元、雅片烟士、到處販賣、一般人民的膏血、無形中被人吸引以去、因此反抗的人、愈見堅决、鬭爭的力量、却愈見健實了、</p>
<p>松花江沿岸、是東北未開發處女地中最膏腴的地方、那一帶有水利之便、夏天可以行船、冬季可以用「巴利」、現在汽車也開通了、稻田的經營、正不在南方産米區域之下、又經過了我們的勞苦同胞多年的努力、現在差不多都開闢出來了、自日人侵入東北以後、第一期是忙於政權的奪取、竭力擴張其軍事的佈置、第二期是用牠的巨大兵力、壓服東北人武力的反抗運動、同時指使傀儡登臺、牠的重大困難、是不容易實現的移民計劃、因爲東北人吃高梁米、日本人却非吃白米不可、而東北出米的地方又很少、所以日人經過了很久的考慮和選擇、找到三姓以東的佳木斯、爲牠在北滿的移民區、那裏有水利可資灌溉、有近代交通工具、足供他們利用、於是日人在今年以前、有過三次移民前來、他們都凖備全副武裝、前後總計約一千四五百人、但有三四百人、過不慣北國生活而逃回去了、這些人到了佳木斯、就開始圈地、凡在他們區域内的中國人高麗人、就令搬開、有的他們也略給微資、有的也祇好忍淚吞聲、各自避開、因而當地一般人對日惡感很深、</p>
<p>義軍本來在潛伏時期、但是爲當前形勢所迫、不能不有所舉動、因此在三姓東面聚集得有一個小集團、打算是一面襲取三姓、一面攻擊佳木斯、偕此得到若干軍械、卽入虎林去、過山林生活、乘機再和日人爭鬭、不意事前爲駐三姓的第十師團·第三十三旅團·步兵六十三聯隊聯隊長飯塚朝吉所偵悉、他就派了一營傀儡軍隊、任左右翼、飯塚自己帶一個中隊的日軍、任中路、去攻打十龍山—義軍的集中地、預備就在那裏出發去攻擊三姓的根據—義軍方面、剛剛凖備好、打算在三月十日午後出發、十一日作拂曉的襲擊、不料日軍在十日那天早晨、就趕到了、恰好遇着義軍整備齊全的時候、當時就給牠一個突擊、傀儡軍隊、本來只是打打應酬仗的、日本碰着這强硬的對頭、經過三小時激戰之後、一個中隊的日軍、全軍覆没、聯隊長大佐飯塚朝吉被打死、中隊長鈴木實·也自然不得活、其餘的日兵、幾乎没有逃脫性命的、義軍方面應戰的部隊、誠然是小部、但是戰鬭却是很激烈、勝利也是從抗戰以來所稀有的、（三月十二日於哈爾濱）</p>

<p>稅雖輕而民不聊生、良惡之分、不外二端、一、負擔是否平均、二、能否保護本國商業、但此次財政部所定之稅率、則適與此兩原則相反、此不能不爲我愛民之政府一陳之也、查捲烟統稅、係於民國十八年開辦、十九年十一月、二十年二月、二十一年三月、凡三經改稅、由十八年七月至十九年十一月、爲七級稅時代、十九年十一月至二十年二月、爲舊三級稅時代、二十年二月至二十一年三月、爲新三級稅時代、二十一年三月至今、爲二級稅時代、稅率按次遞加、捲烟業則民元以前、僅得英美一家、民元以後、華商以國貨號召、紛紛繼起、始有今日、大抵上中烟多半由英美製造、華商則以製造下烟爲特多、上中烟多用美葉、下烟則多用國産美種烟葉及土葉、因稅率高低、與出品上中下之别、英美與華商常居對立之地位、稅率分級多、則上中下烟之負擔、隨烟質之高下而分别重輕、故下烟之負擔較輕、華商居有利之地位、國産烟葉亦隨而暢銷、稅率分級少、則上中下烟之負擔、距離不甚相遠、甚或下烟之負擔、超過上中烟、至一二倍、故上中烟之負擔較輕、英美居有利之地位、國産烟葉亦隨而滯銷、依歷年之經騐、七級稅最有利於華商、三級稅次之、二級稅則英美顯受特惠、華商無復抗爭之力、故七級稅時代、華商共有百五六十家、二級稅行、紛紛倒閉、今則僅存四五十家、年來且銷數銳减、並多虧累矣、二十一年</p>
<p>改二級稅制　之始、卽已紛紛反對、蓋深知待遇不平、無力相抗也、惟財政部堅以試辦爲辭、未蒙改訂、及今年餘、其弊益見、試就歷年英美與其他烟公司銷烟數量及納稅數目分别統計之、則二級稅行、華商受害之深、英美特惠之重、眞有令人駭嘆不已者、英美與其他烟公司銷用捲烟統稅印花、以及各烟公司納稅數目、統稅公報·稅務公報·均有詳細之紀載、現根據之、分别製成三級稅時代、及二級稅時代、英美烟公</p>
<p>司與其他烟公司銷用捲烟統稅印花比較表、納稅數目比較表、先言銷用印花、查統稅定章、捲烟每五萬支爲一大箱、貼用印花一張、是銷用印花數目、卽銷烟之箱數也、在三級稅時代、英美平均數目爲三零四七二、其他公司爲六八四二二、是英美銷烟數量、僅及其他公司之四成零、不及五成、在二級稅時代、英美平均數目爲四八八零八、其他公司爲四四三二三、則英美銷烟數量、已比諸其他公司超過四四八五、嗚呼、一年之間、英美突飛進步如此、華商堕落如彼、有心人聞之、能不失色喪膽乎、次言納稅數目、在三級稅時代、英美烟公司平均數目、爲二·四一七·四零三·八二二、其他烟公司爲二·零零六·二五二·六四七、是英美之負擔、多於華商四十一萬零、在二級稅時代、英美烟公司平均數目、爲二·七二六·三九二·五二二、其他烟公司、爲二·五五四·四六六·九九六·則</p>
<p>英美之負擔　多於華商僅十七萬零、觀此兩表之比較、在三級稅時代、英美之銷數、雖不及華商之五成、而每月納稅之數目、多於華商四十一萬零、蓋烟質好、售價高、故稅亦重、其理本極順也、今改爲二級稅、英美銷烟數目、前之不及華商五成者、已增至加一、稅率如果公平、則英美納稅數目、至少應比華商加倍、而事實之昭示、所多者每月不過十七萬而已、前者銷</p>

<p>小弁言　申報流通圖書館創設讀書指導以來，二月又半了。這二月來，我們這小小事業頗引起了會上一部分人士的注意。我們接受了五百封讀者討論學問的通信、正式請求登記，作爲本部經常研究員的已過二百人了。讀書問答的影響更來得廣大，我們從外埠來信中、可以看出一斑。就來信的地域分，中國各省除粤，桂，滇，黔外，凡本報所到之地，我們都收到讀者的來信，他們都一致的贊成我們這種工作，並且熱心要求加入讀書指導，共同研究大家需要的一些適用的知識。依據申報銷數計算，大致讀書問答的讀者至少要在三分之一以上（五萬餘人）。他們中，大多數不獨愛讀「讀書問答」，還屢次來信探詢我們工作上更多的消息。他們想知道，整個「讀書指導」的一切工作。</p>
<p>我們爲了减少對外埠讀者個别覆信的麻煩，爲了使已登記的讀者大家在精神上更保持一種聯繫、我們急需要出一種刊物、作爲我們精神上的交通。因此，在本部同人才力與財力的有限的現在，特先提前發刊「讀書消息」，以後每逢星期二出版，仍刊載申報「讀書問答」原處，但同日停刊「讀書問答」。</p>

<p>萬國籃球女子錦標、中美之三角决賽、中美昨晚初賽之結果、中華以三十八比二十九之數、淘汰美國、奪得與英國决賽之權、中英决賽將於明晚舉行、以定錦標誰得、</p>
<p>屈居人下</p>
<p>上塲美國氣燄頗盛、楊森雖連罰連中、白那特卽還以顔色、鮑賽克與白那特之合作、美國頓時以七比二超出、居高臨下、不可一世、楊森雖追上二分、美國仍以九比六、十一比六勝第一節、第二節起、中華依舊屈居他人之下、及十五比九、中華竟負六分之鉅、其勢岌岌、殊可担憂、潘夢調出陳榮明、陳聚才與潘夢、雙管齊下、追成十六比十三、僅以三分落後、上半時暫告終結、</p>
<p>軍威大振</p>
<p>下半時陳榮明二次調入、中華軍容忽突然振作、氣吞河山、將美國後防、轟成粉碎、使其顧此失彼、東𣹟西決、陳榮明楊森大顯威風、兩人一連投入十二分之多、遂反以二十五與十六之比、壓倒美國、從此一路順風、美國成爲强弩之末、第三節比數爲三十比十九、中華成十一分、勝負已告大定、最後一節、美國忙於調動人馬、已無能爲力矣、總結果成三十八比二十九、中華得决賽權、</p>

<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>每至春初，尤其是在年頭的當兒，蘇滬杭各處熱閙的地方，常有販賣蘭花之輩，把一束一束的蘭花，安在筐裏或列在道旁，待價而沽。道輩販賣蘭花者，大概都來自江之蕭山。他們走碼頭，趕新年，無非想混碗飯吃吃而已。他們的生涯，是怪可憐的。說起蘭，他是自古以來被君子淑女們所愛惜欣賞而珍視的。孔老夫子就是愛惜蘭的一個。爲了它，他作猗蘭操。琴操裏說··「孔子自衛反魯，隱谷之中，見香蘭獨茂，歎曰··「蘭當爲王者香，今乃獨茂，與衆草爲伍！」乃止車援琴鼓之。自傷不逢時，託辭於香蘭云。」還有，靈均有「香草美人」之喻。這俱是明證。詩經溱洧篇裏說··「溱與洧方渙渙兮，士與女方秉蘭兮」。按蕳卽蘭也。試想溱洧之旁，有士女如雲，手執幽蘭，馨香盈握，俗卉對之，眞要愧死了。這是蘭花爲古人所愛賞的一個鐵證。結拜弟兄，稱爲「義結金蘭」。這是根據易經「二人同心，其利斷金；同心之言，其臭如蘭」的話而來的。劉關張桃園結義，創成鼎足三分。梁山泊上的好漢，有誰不赴湯蹈火，效忠於宋公明的？這俱是受着易經的感化。雖則世風不古，儘有朝結拜而夕卽成寇讐的；然結拜之初，他們又何嘗不希望一輩子利可斷金，言臭如蘭呢？這是蘭花爲人們所珍視的一個明證。</p>
<p>時至今日，人喜新異。號稱有「隱逸之趣」的菊，已遭着厄運，爲人們紥成各式各樣，以取媚於庸俗了。幸而蘭，人們猶不能紥而玩之。雖有開會展覽之舉，然究屬韻事，似不足爲蘭辱。那知據報載，僞國已取蘭爲國花。其理由是··取可與日本永結蘭交之義。這眞辱没煞蘭花了。有心人見了它，恐都要唱一聲聲的「念家山破」罷。然而不雪奇恥，我們又怎對得住這「王者之香」！請全國的上和下細細地想一想。</p>
<h3 id="c213">照Ｘ光 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦子</p>
<p>最近上海有一部分人發起所謂「防癆會議」。前天報上又有某醫院發表防癆意見，說癆病發覺最難，治也最難，所以最好一有呼吸病，立刻就去照Ｘ光，這樣就可及早斷定有無肺病，迅速治療。這話聽着很對。然而這話是對誰說的呢？若是對有錢人講的，那不成問題，若是對一般人說的，那就有點問題。</p>
<p>有肺病要照Ｘ光，這是應該的，然而怎樣呌大家去照Ｘ光，這就有點討論的餘地了。我們知道，生肺病最多的，是營養不良，工作過度，住的吃的，都不衛生，平時不易呼吸到新鮮空氣，生活極不安定的一些人。而這些人却正是世界上唯一的窮人。窮人最易生病，而窮人也最易生肺病（指都市窮人而言，特别是上海的），窮人更不易治肺病。有錢人生病，可以住院休養，再不然，可以上廬山莫干山。而窮人呢？爲吃飯，爲穿衣，任是病到如何田地，他們却仍不能不爲生活而繼續其牛馬式的工作。不要說休養罷，吃服藥恐怕還是困難。請問，在這樣情形之下，呌窮人們怎樣去醫病，怎樣去治療肺病呢？一有呼吸病，就該立刻去照Ｘ光，話是很對，然而照一次Ｘ光，事實上的代價是大洋十五元，起碼要十元以上，請問，呌誰去照得起呢？假使生肺病的都是有錢人，那就一切都不成問題，而且也無庸宣傳防癆，有錢人自會上醫院門請敎，而無奈事實上生肺病的人却大部屬於窮人，請問，這個「癆」如何「防」法？假若照Ｘ光能和熱天的義務防疫釘一樣，可以派着汽車出來沿街義務打針，那倒多少還可收點「防癆」之效（然而照了出來怎樣去治還是一個問題），否則，所謂「防癆」也者，恐怕結果都不過是一句空話罷？</p>
<p>諸位不要以爲我在瞎說，我自己就有一個朋友，患了很深程度的肺病，但因爲錢的問題，也只好放着不治。他還不算怎樣十分窮的，然而三十元一月的三等病房，（至少要住一年）他已無法應付，其他更不用說了。這是一個事實問題。錢的問題不解决，什麽「防癆」不「防癆」，都是空的！</p>

<p>我們需要勇敢的戰士，我們也需要慈祥的保姆，如果有兼戰士的勇敢而兼保姆的慈祥，這才是我們民族的救星。</p>
<p>「良心」，在這個年代已經成了過去的名詞，假如我們用新的語氣說，应是所謂「理智」吧！</p>
<p>在社會上竟有許多男子會抹粉，撒香水，弄的頭光面滑，芳香沁人；還有的竟穿了像女人一般窄小的衣服，豐采旎旎，姿態翩翩，難道這就是藝術家所謂「性之昇」華」？</p>
<p>僞善的人，總是站在前面享着幸福，正直的人總是落在後面吃苦頭，這是告訴我們現在正是没有是非的世界。</p>

<p>第二十六回</p>
<p>慷慨剖胸襟忘家報國</p>
<p>凄凉對玉鏡嗟我懐人</p>
<p>這裏的百姓回家，但是到這裏來的駐防軍隊，情形却漸漸緊張起來。原來這一營兵，所以乘了風沙之夜，開出口子來，就是怕敵人注意，或者要藉口中國軍隊已經開始調動了，就要前來侵犯。中國的軍隊，在中國境内調動，却要怕敵人來干涉。這原是一椿可痛心的事，但是調防的軍隊，居然，能够移到目的地，不受外力的障碍，這也就難得了。不過在駐防後的第三天，半空上就發現飛機了。那飛機在堡頂上飛着，約莫有半小時，好像知道這堡裏藏着軍隊一樣。在這個時候，營長突然發下命令，弟兄們，百姓們，完全不許在屋外張望。軍人是要服從命令的，自然誰也不敢出頭。可是各弟兄心裏都明白，這必是敵人的偵察機來了。老早就聽到了上級軍官說，中國已經買了許多飛機，有外國人駕駛。而且爲了防止敵人飛機起見，各部軍隊，都撥給高射砲，或者高射機關槍。現在不但是没有看到自己的飛機，就是高射砲也不曾撥來一架，眼睜睜看着人家的飛機在半空裏發威風，可抵擋不住。大家有這種猜想，臉上當然也就發現一種猜疑的樣子出來。飛機過去了一小時，寳芳營長，也知道了這種情形，就把四個連長都找了去。四個連長並排的和他對面站着，他挺了胸脯，直着視綫，沉住了臉色道：四位連長，你們知道駐防到這裏來，是我的主動嗎？四個連長直挺挺的站着，没有作聲。（三四○）</p>

<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>（四）由民衆化分成的派别</p>
<p>自硯的形式與雕琢，旣深入民衆化後，漸漸傳播於各省間，於是民衆化中，遂又生出派别來，以製硯論，鞽名的有三派，廣東人的作品，有特殊氣韵，能利用石疵石眼與　皮等，製成種種花樣，以顯其優美，徽州人的作品，如雕琢魚龍殿閣瓜果等類，務極工細，蓋當時製墨工人與製硯家能互相研究之故，江浙人的作品，多趨於高尙幽雅，學士文人自作的硯，大都愛好天然風韻，自書自刻，日人坂東貫山氏最推重此派，確實是有意思的。至於硯匣，愛硯家亦甚重視的，大抵質用紫檀紅木黃楊枸杞等而内加以琴光漆，或純用漆而加以種種雕琢與裝飾，如廣州·福州·徽州·楊州·蘇州·北京，等處工人，所製硯匣，韻趣色樣，各不相同，故硯匣亦有派别，苟有名作品，可一望而知爲某派的，此類有關附屬文化的事，甚爲繁複，不暇詳舉，祇略述一些大概，大家就可以知道的。</p>
<p>（五）硯材與文藝的總評</p>
<p>硯的文藝到清代稱李極盛，而端溪水巖的開發，亦稱極盛，於是愛文藝者，與愛佳硯材而不主重雕飾，甚至倡天然硯或竟以硯板藏之者，遂分成兩派，相爭不已，言之各有理由，惟吾人之意，硯的主體，究貴適用，故論硯者必當先研究硯材，硯材果良，然後加以精工之題銘與雕刻，及一切美觀的裝飾，始愈顯其美。若材不佳良，而徒飾外觀，無異外金玉而中敗絮，殊爲不取。反之，有極佳的硯材，而被俗傖市賈，妄施惡劣雕刻，假冒名人題跋，則又何異佛頭着糞，硯書所謂强作解事，汚此端友，更爲可惜，故有良硯材而無精妙的題刻，則毌寗樸素不雕之爲愈，雖以石片藏之，猶不失爲佳品，此一般人公平之論也　硯與文藝的關係，大概如此，以下就要說到硯本的本質了。</p>

<p>（二）碧藍海岸的尼斯</p>
<p>法蘭西眞是人世的一座樂園，我暫且不說繁華甲天下的巴黎都市景象，先從自然界風景方面，做一個素描。</p>
<p>法蘭西在地理上，佔有兩處不同海岸的特殊優先權，一處是面臨着地中海迂迥到古文化的國土，另一處是沿着北海遙望見新的世界。其他的國土，自然也都有引人入勝的特徴，譬如意大利是充滿着藝術和歷史，常在一個永久碧藍天空之下，籠罩在幸福的氣候中；瑞士，以山水名天下，在北方天空之下，是一個人間的大花園。</p>
<p>在法蘭西的南方，有一個地方呌做「碧藍海岸」ＣＯＴＥＤＡＺＯＲ，是世界著名避寒和避暑的唯一勝地，伊兼具有意大利和瑞士兩國的優點，這是一個夢境中的世界，一年四季，老是春天的氣候，是一個没有冬天的海岸。可愛的太陽，冬天囇暖地土，夏天並不灼熱遊們的皮膚，從歲頭到年尾，園圃裏常常開放着美麗的花草卉木。</p>
<p>歐洲大陸上各國的重要政治家，事業家，富豪，名人，優伶，和新大陸黃金國的實業大王和好萊鳱的明星們，一到冬天，都走上旅途，羣集「碧藍海岸」，度假避寒，在那個可愛和暖的太陽底下，追逐嬯戲。</p>
<p>在這「碧藍海岸」最著名的地方是尼斯ＮＩＣＥ。尼斯這個名字自從希臘文ＭＩＫＥ，蛻傳下來的一個譯音，譯義解作「勝利」，在那裏到如今還保留着許多古羅馬帝國的建築。在一八六○年，當地居民僅二萬六千人，今日已激增至十八萬四千餘人，每年成千成萬的旅客還不計算入内。</p>
<p>自然風景方面，有的是温暖可愛的太陽，碧藍的天空和海水，金黃色的沙灘，亞爾卑的山麓，翠綠成蔭的橄欖樹，和各種芬芳奇異的花卉樹果。尼斯的「花市」和「百花節」，是世界有名的。在較幽靜的鄉村，到處可以看見房屋的墻上曬滿陽光，薔薇色的屋瓦，環繞着長春藤或蔓廷着牽牛花。在赭石性的土地上，滋長着葡萄，桑椹和橄欖，和各式各樣的松柏。</p>
<p>人工建築方面，古代的有第十五世紀的敎堂古堡，可供考古家的摩挲；近代的有一英國人行道」，可容二十人並肩步行，是世界最大的一條散步廣道，從早到夜，有各國各色民族的旅客在那裏徘徊散步，最注目的是那些戴大闊邊草帽和穿着大褲脚管「印度褲子」的女人們，伊們上身穿的是無袖裸胸的游泳衣，手裏牽着一頭北京小巴兒狗，也有面蒙黑沙穿黑衣的女人，遠看好像是小寡孀，但是滿街可以看見不少那樣服裝的姑娘，據說這些都是一九三三年尼斯最流行的女人時裝。</p>
<p>尼斯有許多的歌臺舞塲，都是建築得非常富麗，最著名的是「堤岸游戲塲」ＡＳＩＮＯＤＥＪＥＴＥＥ築於海上，四面臨海，全以鋼骨建造，堅固異常。内設舞塲一，劇塲一，賭塲一，頗似上海的大世界。此外，有歐州最貴族化的ＮＥＧＲＥＩＣＯ大旅館，最摩登化的「地中海宫」，（惜於去年冬季已燬於火），聞名全世界的大賭窟「蒙德加羅」ＭＯＮＴＥＯＲＲＬＯ，距離尼斯，祗有數小時的路程。</p>
<p>我想讀者　　於「碧藍海岸」的尼斯，已得相當梗概的印象了下回再來說尼斯各種假節熱閙的情形。</p>

<p>— 方濟之</p>
<p>社會只見其不平安，古怪事是只見其多的。遠之有視飛來伯爲大文豪而熱烈歡迎的事，其次有梁作友大閙南京的事，其次有小孩兒冒風雪遊行募捐的事，當然爲的是救國，其次有······</p>
<p>稍在人心者，看了許多古古怪怪的事要驚奇，感傷，太息。許多人的行動，好象打多了旋子的結果，昏天黑地。考其故，第一是無知，第二是要故意討好。這兩種脾氣參合，變成了一種瘋狂。可憐的現代國民，許多在這瘋狂狀態中生活。</p>
<p>其實這由來也頗久的。明末有人說過··「家家有半閒之堂，事事同小兒之戲，成俗大多爾爾，世情亦復悠悠。」細看現在許多事，和這種景况差不多的，只是我們未必「家家有半閒之堂」了。</p>
<p>這種瘋狂裏的行動大約是如此的··第一是嘈雜一通，閙的莫衷一是，例如開一個大會，閙一通之後，萬事依然；第二是因此損傷着許多東西。因爲無知或討好，不得謂之壞良心。譬如一座磁器店起火，碗兒碟兒瓶兒罐兒要打成一片了。從前許多條約之類，是苟且糊里糊塗訂下的，無知無遠見，不明中華民國便因此受了傷害，子子孫孫要有負担的，以爲洋人因此佩服了，而不知其心中正笑我之愚，欺我之弱。第三却非同小可了，變態容易老羞，老羞成怒，人情之常，有誰指摘錯誤和揭穿黑幕的，反激起「倒行逆施」，遠之三一八在那時的執政府前，竟有女孩兒們喋血，有許多人丢掉了性命，是着了這種瘋魔的　在作事與將來作事的人，應該擺脫了舊的黑暗，丢開奴才心性，多求點常識再說！</p>

<p>— 陶亢德</p>
<p>我的家鄉和徐懋庸先生的家鄉一樣：「當人們興高采烈熱中於某事某人某物之際，忽有他人作悟徹語以掃其興者」，「呌做「攙冷水」」，例如一個嫁人近十年尙未舉一雄的少奶奶忽然肚子擴大正當興高采烈熱中於燒香謝送子娘娘之際，忽有他人對他說「你丈夫年餘不回家了，你的肚子高也許是久受你婆婆「不會生兒子」的辱駡而得的臌脹病呢，還不如省下香燭錢去請醫生診之爲愈」。那這個人就是「攙冷水」者。這杓冷水是「殺人不見血的軟刀子」，還是「當頭棒喝」，似乎得以該少奶奶肚子之所以擴大是臌脹病還是懷孕以爲斷。若不幸臌脹病之言而中，則該少奶奶對於卽將生子的高興雖一掃無餘，未免心灰意冷，但省香燭錢而作診金，於實際上不是無益。故潑冷水的是非利害，要看被潑者所熱中的事物人之確當否以爲斷。</p>
<p>溥儀稱帝之後，聽說各地的遺老遺少興高采烈紛電道賀，於斯時也，忽有人作悟徹語道··「溥儀不過是傀儡，對傀儡稱臣不如去朝溥儀的相片山呼萬歲好的」。這也是潑遺老遺少以冷水，但這冷水該没有人敢說是殺人不見血的軟刀子，雖然遺老遺少或因此而心灰意冷。潑冷水者原想潑的對方心灰意冷少爲民族出醜的，故雖遺老們因心灰意冷而投水懸梁，潑冷水者也不必抱「我雖不殺伯仁，伯仁由我而死」的内疚。又例如有只會在家打黃臉婆，不敢出外和打過他十記耳光的强鄰哼一聲的胚子，忽然見那强鄰駡另一個鄰人而揎袖捋臂的要打抱不平去了，忽有人說「你還是在家裏打黃臉婆罷」，此言也是攙冷水也，但也不見得是把殺人不見血的軟刀子。又如對不量德不度力以澄清宇宙爲志，胡作亂爲，攪得宇宙一塌糊塗的人潑一杓冷水，實在可說是功德無量，萬一他眞的因此冷水心灰意冷回頭去理他補缸修　的舊業。</p>
<p>總而言之，潑冷水之是不是殺人不見血的軟刀子，要看被潑者是什麽人幹什麽事，絶不能一筆抹煞。否則，世上將全是捧臀拍腿順風扯篷的東西了，國事尙可爲乎？因見今之潑冷水者十九非對「熱心青年」而潑，故草斯文以告熱心愛護青年如徐懋庸先生者。</p>

<p>— 味茘</p>
<p>ＸＸ：</p>
<p>記得去年我們動身來廣州的時候，有一位朋友來船上送行，他對我說過這麽一句話··「眞傻，到廣州去敎書！」當時我實在有點茫然，現在才知道他說的話眞對，我確實幹了一件傻事。</p>
<p>没有起程以前，我也曾向朋友們打聽打聽廣州的事情。他們告訴我的不過是廣州天氣非常熱，生活程度很高，還有，廣東人用的毫洋比我們的大洋「推班」些。當時我以爲這一點小吃虧有什麽要</p>
<p>緊，所以就决定到廣州來了。誰知道到了這裏一看，花樣眞多着呢！今天我想先和你談談廣州市的捐。</p>
<p>最好先從薪水講起。在我們學校，外省敎授總算很受優待，每月薪水毫洋四百元。這個數目字，寫在紙上，誰不說冠冕堂皇，但是···但是事實上是另一回事。每月領薪水的時候，我們要繳百分之四所得捐，我們要繳百分之四黨部基金捐，又是我們還要繳一元五毫義勇軍捐（據說這是寄到關外給東北義勇軍打仗用的），這三項加起來一共是三十三元五毫。記得去年第一次領薪水的時候，我們還替廣東合作社（？）認繳了一股，計毫洋十元，聽說敎書的人大家都要做股東，但是合作社股票到現在還不見送來。這是就學校方面說。</p>
<p>你，知道我是帶家眷來的，學校没有地方給敎職員住家，所以我們在外面另租房子住。照天理講，廣州市租並不算貴，比較南京便宜多了，—而且可住的房子也容易找。在廣州租房子住，每月除了房租，還要納「房捐警費」，這是公安局規定的。房捐佔房租百分之十五，例如我們現在每月付房租四十三元，那麽要納房捐六元四毫五仙，這是房東和我們平分的；我們自己每月須另繳潔凈費二毫。此外，還有許多臨時的附加捐，我總算運氣好，在廣州住了半年，還没有捐過一個仙。但是我看見那張公安局發來的繳捐證上面寫着許多已經收過的「租捐」。我計算了一下，從民國十二年到民國二十二年，一共有十九種捐。現在我隨便寫幾種在下面··「十二年借租一月」，「十五年綏靖罷工」，「十五年北伐」，「十六年罷工津貼」，「二十一年救國半月」「二十二年防空一期」，「二十二年防空二期」，「二十二年救國六日」····名義眞多，可惜每次所捐的數目没有寫出來，否則倒是一種很有價値的統計材料。</p>
<p>在廣州不但住房子要捐，就是點電燈也要捐。前個月我家裏用了十七度電，電費計算起來恰是三元四毫，可是廣州市電力管理委員會的收費員又要我多付三毫四仙，聽說這是附加的「敎育費」，我才明白點電燈和辦敎育原來也有關係。電燈有捐，電報也非捐不可，因爲此電也，彼亦電也，爲什麽彼此待遇不同？我昨天發了一個電報到上海，電報費計算起來大洋一元二角，可是附加費却要花大洋三角六分（百分之三）。幸而現在上海廣州間每星期有兩次航空信，這樣我們也可以少吃虧一點。</p>
<p>這些捐，自然不能包括廣州市的捐的全部，我不過將自己所捐的。和你隨便談談。你想，一個敎書匠每月收入能有多少，這一捐，那一捐，怎麽經得起捐呢？每天站在講台上喝粉筆灰替别人賣</p>
<p>命，這不是傻是什麽？</p>
<p>其實，單是捐，吃虧究竟有限，最可怕的是這個吮我們的血液的怪物，他的名字呌做「不兌現的鈔票」，關於這個，下次再告訴你罷。</p>

<p>— 魯彦</p>
<p>一、離滬之前被包又綑好了。搬家，旅行，計算起來，幾乎没有一年不綑被包，有幾次，一年中還綑了三四回。</p>
<p>「我要把你綑起來，我要把你帶到别一個地方去。」我對着被包說。</p>
<p>於是包，就毫不反抗的任我綑縛，讓我帶着走了。</p>
<p>牠的命運完全在我的手中。　然而我自己的命運呢，却在另一個不識者的手中。</p>
<p>「我要把你綑起來，我要把你帶到别一個地方去！」那個對我伸着手的人說。</p>
<p>於是我被牽着走了。</p>
<p>每次每次，都是這樣。這次也依然如此。</p>
<p>被包將經過一些什麽樣的路程呢？將被放在什麽樣的地方呢？—牠並不知道。</p>
<p>我呢，我也不能知道，將遇到一些什麽，見到一些什麽，將過一些什麽樣的生活，將是歡樂或悲哀，將是或是死。　莉莎在望着我，想我抱，她不知道我是她的父親，更不知道我要走了。正和我不曉得自己將遇到什麽一樣。</p>
<p>恩哥知道我要走了，但他不曉得我到很遠的地方去，他以爲我和平素一樣的當天就會回來。正和莉莎不知道我要走的一樣。</p>
<p>麗麗知道我將許久纔能回來，然而她知不曉得我爲什麽要走。她也正和恩哥不知道我不會立刻回來的一樣。</p>
<p>蘭和母親可全知道了。她們知道我爲什麽要走，什麽時候纔能回來。然而她們也只和我一樣，不能知道我將遇到一些什麽，也不能知道她們自己將遇到一些什麽。（未完）</p>

<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>一切都是春天，一切人都有着春天，只有我的心是寒冷的，寂寞的，春天已從我身上過去了！</p>
<p>忽然一隻大的手拍到了我肩上，一個穿着藏青色西服的青年站在我面前。我茫然的抬起頭來向他望，我認得他，他是我的朋友平，正陶醉在一個幸福的愛情的夢裏的朋友平。</p>
<p>「平，是你」。我激動地握住了他的手。我在想，他的熱情的話語也許能温暖我的心。但卽刻我便失望了。我瞧見了他的臉，那是一個憂悄的臉，眼珠裏帶得有幻滅和悲哀。這黯澹的没有光輝的眼珠呵！我只一瞧見，便知道有一支絶望的利箭射中了這青年人的心。他的心已經死了。</p>
<p>「平，你有什麽煩惱？」我忍不住問他　「我完了！她愛上了一個官僚，抛棄了我！」他搖搖頭，痛苦地說，聲音裏帶着眼淚。</p>
<p>他是走上我往日所走的路了。這不幸的青年人，在他的生命裏，也已没有了春天。我將怎樣安慰他呢？在一個失戀人的面前，一切安慰的話語都失了效用，我是有這種經騐的。我只能同情地和他交換着眼光，同情地伴着他一同走那不愉快的路程。</p>
<p>「生命有什麽意義呀！」他歎息了，聲音像落花飄墮到水面上一樣的輕幽。</p>
<p>「生命是痛苦的。可是，讓我們忘懷了一切吧！」</p>
<p>「好！忘懷了一切！」他閃動着眼珠說，眼珠裏稍微有了一些光輝。但這光輝的時間是很短的，不久便消滅了。</p>
<p>於是，我們便上了一座酒樓，一座有着東方的古典風味裝飾的酒樓。各自啣着生命的苦杯，默默的喝着杯裏的血液似的酒。忘懷了時代，忘懷了人生，忘懷了戀愛，也忘懷了春天。</p>
<p>空氣裏不時響着輕微的碰杯聲音，桌上排列空的酒瓶，我們都有些醉意了。我搖晃着身體站起來，把手裏僅剩的半杯酒潑在地上，夢囈似地說··</p>
<p>「酹别這不愉快的春天吧！</p>
<p>我希望明年有一個有希望的春天到來。」</p>
<p>他笑了，我也笑了，我們的兩對眼珠互相望着，眼裏都含着晶瑩的淚。</p>
<h3 id="c225">暮（九） <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>

<p>「十點鐘没有到，就這樣困了！」</p>
<p>「我也是這樣，腰還有一點酸。」</p>
<p>「那我們就睡吧。」</p>
<p>於是她們就喊來女僕，把床替他們整好，她們換了衣服就睡上去，女僕把電燈爲他們熄了　她們像很想立刻睡着，就一句話也不說，青松輕輕地轉了一個身，因爲月光灑在她的臉上。可是她仍然没有能睡去，她看着青枝睡着一絲不動的身軀，她聽見金魚在吐着水的聲音。但是無論如何她像是不能睡了，她的心總在想着些什麽，模糊而有着深厚惆悵滋味的。她閉起眼來，想就是從此不能再張開也情願；可是仍然没有一點用。她默數着壁鐘的擺，從一下數到一千，數到兩千；她還是那麽清醒，縱然是焦灼着，也是没有一點方法了。</p>
<p>她爽性又把身子轉回去，任月光照在臉上，她睜大了眼睛看着浴在月光裏的景物，她想着月光或能洗去自己胸中的鬰悶。</p>
<p>秋夜裏的高樹，爲風吹動，凄凉地在響着，壁鐘又在敲着十二下了。</p>
<p>她輕微地吐出一口長長的嘆息。</p>
<p>「妹妹，你也没有睡麽？」</p>
<p>「呵，不知怎麽睡不着呢！」青松把身子又轉向了青枝。</p>
<p>「我聽見你轉身，還以爲你是睡着了。」</p>
<p>青松没有再說什麽，只沉靜地在月光裏凝望着，深秋夜氣的寒流，使她打了一個冷戰。</p>
<p>「你是冷麽？」</p>
<p>「不，不知怎樣會打一個寒戰。」</p>
<p>壁鐘悠然地響了一下。</p>
<p>「都到一點鐘了。」青枝稍稍露了一點驚訝。</p>
<p>「長夜也是將盡了。」青松傷感地說。</p>
<p>「妹妹，我們一定要好好睡一下。」</p>
<p>青枝把手抱了青松的身軀，臉儇了臉，睡到一個枕頭上，滴到白的床單上面了。</p>
<p>她們緊緊的抱了，沉寂中，有她們輕永的嚧欷。（完）</p>

<p>標紗壓力沉重</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、外棉平平、商塲上且有流言、人氣驟虚、賣風又起、金鷄標紗一度跌進八十元關内、拍至二三盤又見回上、結果各月跌五·八角至一元一·二角、午後聞現紗銷路尙好、各月漲一·三·六角、全日成交統計二萬九千五百包、查賣出賡豐七百五十包、大昌成一千包、長豐三千二百五十包、福大一千六百五十包、惠康五百四十包、買進同和一千零五十包、大昶九百包、恒昌一千包、義餘五百包、仁豐五百包、泰昌五百包、錦昌七百五十包、義成六百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼俏之象、洋麥報價、出入仍微、芝加哥大八分零、坎拿大小一角零、故開價後、市面平靜如常、後以廠家仍無出檔、本月份因不久又須交割、廠家籌碼、雖客帮無大交易、惟一部分因有其他關係、均自動收回、致近期人心帶好、遠期亦稍跟上、</p>
<p>迨至下午開盤、本月份因廠家仍有掉期交易、收進近期、套出遠期、客帮則有進有出、實銷迄少活動、照目下情形、或者廠家别有用意、吸收近期、藉可維持標凖耳、結果本月較前週好一分七厘半、四月份好二分、五月份好一分二厘半、六月份好五厘、七月份漲七厘半、八月份好五厘、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c241">談塲面 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦子</p>
<p>現在人都講究談塲面。衣服要漂亮，形容要整飭，這樣，走到人面前，才不受人討厭。乃至於一切飲食起居，交際應酬，都非要有塲面不可。塲面是當今唯一處世的要訣。任是家裏怎樣的貧寒，經濟怎樣困難，塲面不能不講究。那怕你手頭怎樣拮据，跑出去却不能不裝出一派濶氣。蘇州人所謂「身上軟披披家裏没有夜飯米」，就是這個道兒。現在的社會，是唯五講究塲面的社會。要是你没有塲面，那你到處就會受到人家的白眼。有塲面的，就是到商店家去買東西，店員們會特别殷勤招待你些，到酒館飯館中去，侍役們會多給你鞠幾個躬。原來，這社會根本就是個勢利的社會。</p>
<p>這社會爲什麽根本是一個勢利的社會呢？這因爲大家要得到一温半飽太困難了，因爲要得到温飽的困難，所以一部分可以得到温飽的人，就變成異常高貴人。大部分不能得到温飽的人，相形之下，便變成了異常低下的人了。這樣，社會上便發生貧富的差異。更因貧富的差異，而使人大家都愛走富的道路，而不願走貧的道路，貧遂成衆矢之的。</p>
<p>其實社會上本來何嘗有所謂上上，這些不過都是人爲的。人因爲自私自利（自然，這完全爲客觀經濟條件所决定的），所以社會才發生上下；社會的差别關係，原不過是一些人爲的關係，譬如前例，人国爲要裝塲面，所以不能不盡所有的收入用表面的體面上去，忍飢耐凍，皆所不惜；還有，他本來應該買一部書看看的，然而因爲塲面關係，他不能不把買書的錢拿來買漂亮的衣服穿，知識可以不增進，塲面則非得維持不可。推而廣之，工人的做工，農民的種田，他們本來應該時時設法增進知識，講究技術改良的，然而因爲生活的關係，使他們無法再分出一部心思精力到這上面來，因此人們因生活而力擺塲面，結果因塲面而生活愈難安全，然則，怎樣可以使人忘掉了「生活問題」來盡力於社會的進步上呢？這就非先將使「生活」成爲「問題」的社會客觀條件根本改造一下不可。自然，這是一個大問題。</p>
<h3 id="c242">没有兒子不好麽！（續） <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>

<p>「那就得了，别再自尋煩惱吧」！</p>
<p>這時金妹給我送來一盆滾燙的面水，翻身後退，迎面碰关葆妹，說··</p>
<p>「你瞧，三哥又在哭了，總是想不開，還不過是三十歲的人，就生怕没有兒子養老」。聲音低低的說了隱進内房去了。</p>
<p>「自從姆媽過世了，越哭得厲害了」。隱約的還聽着葆妹回答了這麽兩句。</p>
<p>「呵！三哥原來是因爲還没有生育，所以這樣急呵」！我按牢着他的悲哀的隱伏，就這麽說了。</p>
<p>「嗡嗡嗡」！他越益哭得高漲起來。</p>
<p>「只管哭眞不成樣兒，有心事好說啦」！我婉然的勸解他。</p>
<p>「我眞不知道前世做了什麽歹事，今世這樣的受着報應，四弟都有了兩個兒子，只有我，····」</p>
<p>「三哥，這怎好勉强？有兒子固然也好，但若没有，也値不得這麽悲傷呵！你要知道人生的意義，並非就在生子</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>傳種！而且這樣的汚濁世界，生了兒子又有什麽好處？又有什麽用塲？除了挨餓，除了讓他去喂砲彈，更那裏有兒子揷足做人的地方？像父母之生養了我，又得着了什麽好處，臨終要想見見面，都不可能，我眞才感到無限的悲哀！要有兒子做什麽呵」！</p>
<p>「五弟·你不要欺騙我·你們在外邊走的人，總容易找得救治的辦法，你應替我找找辦法呢」！</p>
<p>「就是，我若在外邊得着了什麽方法，總得趕快告你」！這樣三哥才没有哭了。</p>
<p>而今又是一年了，我没有辦法可找！而這一段回憶，却是時常湧上我的心頭。</p>
<p>我想，這世界，那裏需要人類生育兒子？没有不好麽！完</p>

<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>一椿事物在各方的觀點不同上看來，當然是不會相同的。譬如一個文學家在他工作的時候，抽上一枝烟，在他自己，當然是有上非常的意義，因爲不如此便似乎不能將「文思」從腦經中跑出來，而把他作爲興奮神經的工具。然而在普通人——尤其是不喜吸烟的人——看來，覺得是二個小小的「浪費」了。</p>
<p>再如我的一個朋友，在乘車的時候一個不留神，帽子被小癟三搶去了，而小癟三則以價值十元的呢帽，祇取得二元的代價售給中間商人，這在我的朋友，當然是一筆損失不必說，而小癟三祇得了十分之二的代價，似乎也是一種「浪費」；然而在經濟的原理上論起來，這「浪費」是不成立的。因爲我那朋友雖然受了損失，小癟三雖然祇得了很低的代價，而中間商人却得了利益，同時另一買主也得了便宜，於呢帽的本身，並没有生出甚麽變化。</p>
<p>我在本文所要提出的却是廣義的浪費。</p>
<p>我國爲什麽自從鼎革以來，祗二十餘年的工夫，便會積弱到現在的地步？幾乎處於萬刧不復的地位？誰也知道是歷年的天災人禍，内亂外患所造成的。近年來資本主義的發展，工業國家的貨物過剩，均以我國作傾銷的尾閭，吸收我國的現金。尤其可怕的是農産品的大量輸入，猛力的打破了我們「以農立國」的軍營，以數我們全國的百分之七十的農民流離失所，兼之大水的兩次泛濫，更使他們無田可耕；而同時都市的工商業因了一般的購買力之減退，也時時在邊線上搖搖欲墜，在最近號稱「東方巴黎」的上海，有五百多家大商店受到「查封」的警告。内地的危險性，格外地繼續增高。失業的人，一年比一年增加，一日比一日衆多，在這種現狀之下，時間與人力的浪費，若要以數目字具體的統計起來，是一個多麽驚人的數量！　　根據了上述的現狀所演進的，够得上資産階級的資格的，眼見農村破産，工商凋敝，更不敢投資到這些上面去，作孤注之一擲。於是便祗有「銀行」是他們的出路，他們自己，更樂得終日跳舞塲，咖啡館，以樂餘年。而那些稍有姿色的婦女，也不得不貢獻他們的肉體，以冀沾得餘瀝，維持日常的生活。</p>
<p>因循復因循，必然有那總崩潰的一天，一發而不可收拾！</p>
<p>然而欲求挽救，亦惟有從根本着手，從速消滅這可怕而鉅大的「浪費」。至於空言「救濟」是没有甚麽用的。</p>

<p>第二幕的佈景那就眞像一個高貴人家的癮了。幕開時，奶媽站在門口，而門裏另一人不進塲在與她對話，原來是她的在工廠做工的丈夫跑來告訴她說是自己的孩子病重，兩人哭着哀慟一番。（「在門裏的是凌鶴自己」，波兒說「兩夫妻自己在做自己的戲。」我們都笑起來。自然是輕輕地。）姨太太的高跟鞋聲將他們驚散了，對於奶媽抱小少爺在門口風裏站着，姨太太駡了奶媽一陣。奶媽跪下要求回家去看自己的孩子，姨太太大駡一塲，結果掉了兩塊洋錢呌寄别人帶回家去請醫生，算是大發慈悲。姨太太要了小少爺自己抱，奶媽進去。（那小少爺是假的，奶媽掉東西似地掉給姨太太抱，這當然是不合情理的，我說，「用凌鶴太太自己的小孩上塲一定比較好些，」波兒說，「那不好，要他哭他不哭，不要他哭他偏哭起來那就麻煩，」）老爺進塲，對於孩子高興了不得，姨太太問他有什麽酬報，（其實是徐秘書替他生的！）老爺一高興，將一萬五千元的銀行摺子給她，她拾了孩子上去和老爺親親熱熱。不料孩子哭起來，奶媽聞聲上塲抱小少爺正是姨太太在和老爺親親熱熱的時候，被姨太太喝退。奶媽下去，皮鞋聲響，進來了徐秘書，老爺正進迫着一銀行行長劉鐵生的到來救急，門外汽車喇叭呌，以爲劉鐵聲來了，却進來了小姐。老爺問小姐關於劉先生的事，小姐說不曉得，老爺責問一番，小姐却不肯嫁給老頭子劉鐵聲，多方勸說，老爺說，秘書勸，姨太太也帮說，終於小姐願意了，不過要自由，她說，「祇要他能够滿足我物質上的要求，不是嫁給誰都一樣嗎？」門外汽車喇叭又呌，老爺以爲劉鐵聲來了，却是大太太。太太坐下，姨太太讓位，太太將麻將經背了一通，眞是氣死了老爺，但也不能做聲。（這一穿揷，表演迫眞，臺下觀衆都滿意，我就是一個捧塲的人。）太太進去，談不多時，門外汽車喇叭又呌，大家以爲這回劉鐵聲眞的來了，進來的却是一個債權人劉靜甫—因爲没有現錢，所以勸女兒嫁給劉鐵聲而想向他借現欵，不料劉鐵聲不來，却來了這麽一個討債者，這使老爺眞是難以應付了。勉强約定後天還債，將劉靜甫送出門，劉鐵生來了電話却說是必須全部財産抵押，没辦法，老爺只好答應。可是不幸的是廠裏罷工的消息，由汽車夫阿祥來報告以後，徐秘書趕快出去應付，而將老爺怔住了！第二幕完。</p>
<p>這一幕可謂最精采的了。劇情旣緊張有趣，演員演來也惟妙唯肖，姨太太　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　分，其餘的演員都賣力而得到好處。周道小姐的成功，臺下觀衆都讚揚不絶於耳·一</p>
<p>第三幕還是第一幕的佈景，一開塲奶媽和王媽在將周公館的破産作爲談話的資料，奶媽發了幾句惡人惡報的牢騷，（王媽表演恰好，老黃說，「這小孩子將來一定了不得！」）老爺上塲，用人們退下，老爺正在焦迫劉鐵聲爲什麽約定這時送銀來還不來，小姐出來報告姨太太捲欵跑了。小姐主張報告公安局巡捕房追緝，老爺說，「不要聲張出去，給文學家作小說，戲劇家編戲劇，那才不樂意呢。」不料禍不單行，廠裏來電話說是工人打毁工廠，徐秘書原來與姨太太同逃並不負責，這使我爺氣得發昏了。太太聽說出來責問怎麽樣，一種女流的見解，令人討厭，正在使老爺苦惱的時候，討債的劉靜甫衡進來了！老爺吩咐小姐趕到劉鐵聲那裏去催錢，對討債者大發脾氣，而電話來說，劉鐵聲那金融界巨子今早標金失敗自殺了，這就使老爺發昏了。（幕下戲完）</p>
<p>這劇的演員是賣力而成功的，可是劇本上如末了一幕却是小說的結局而非戲劇的收塲，似乎微嫌美中不足，而莎士比亞式的獨白，也似乎不很好，不知凌鶴先生自己以爲何如？</p>
<p>（昨天所載的稿，關於第一幕的收塲記錯了，那正是第二幕的收塲，而當時只是老爺與徐秘書在談話以後，老爺進去聽電話，徐秘書與姨太太在胡調而下幕。）</p>
<h3 id="c246">嫂子與小姑 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 炯女士</p>
<p>根據向來的解釋，所謂小姑，就是在一個家庭裏面，所有嫂嫂對夫妹的稱呼。</p>
<p>在從前，我們身處在舊家庭裏面，常常可以看見和聽得由小姑的口中，可以發生許多不幸的事！這就是說··在一個家庭裏面，嫂嫂的幸福與否，都要以小姑的口舌爲轉移。假若嫂嫂狡猾的，手段高的，能用許多的計策，可以得着小姑的歡心，討小姑的好，那末，她一定可以多少得到些利益。就是說··至少，那作嫂嫂的人，不會怎麽樣受公婆的氣，挨丈夫的打和駡····在她的地位上，也因以抬得高些。所以由此觀之，從前和現在一般仍然處在舊家庭裏面的，作嫂嫂的人，是何等難，難如上青天啊！</p>
<p>記得有一句這樣的古語··「大姑子的精，小姑子的怪」，所謂大姑子，就是指大於丈夫的，他的姐姐；所謂小姑子，就是指小於丈夫的，他的妹妹。兩者在家庭地位，如是其高；兩者在嫂嫂的身上，是怎樣的呌人可怕，罪惡····這在人道上講，又是如何的慘酷啊！</p>
<p>婦女，在社會地位上，已經是極端的痛苦和可憐！數千年來，慣於封建習尙的壓迫；傳統的思想，不給她們任何的自由；各種不平等的慘酷的待遇，實在够使他們痛心疾首啊！誰料除了上面種種社會制度給予她們的打擊和剝削之外，還有這種意外的，同類的，所謂小姑互相殘殺，互相妒嫉，這種身爲嫂嫂者，也是如何的不幸喲！</p>
<p>歐風東漸，由於産業革命以後，撞破了法國婦女的警鐘，而自動起來要求婦女在社會上的地位和人權。於是中國的婦女，也漸漸的響應起來，自「五四運動以來，也自動的要求解放了，且起而和舊社會作種種的鬥爭。中國的舊家庭制度，也漸漸的隨着時代的狂流而崩潰。小姑制度，亦因之没落。這是不可諱言的事實！同時也是我們應該慶幸的一個新的現象。所以一切的社會現象，都起着新的反映。我們除了翹首企望着，今後婦女的前途，是値得樂觀之外，還應努力共同推動推動牠，急速的向前　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　本來，在任何一個家庭裏面，就拿舊式的家庭來說吧··多數的夫婦間，還是有着熱烈的愛情在在着，但爲了那種惡劣和封建的環境的壓迫，不敢表諸言外··縱然愛戀，亦不能表諸面色！小姑等，苛刻痛心的待遇，似妒嫉殘酷，驅使公婆，丈夫出於不得已的，無辜的打駡，一家的不睦···往往可以使得嫂嫂走到自殺和極痛心的境地！在舊式家庭裏面，小姑制度，簡直是一個罪惡極了的一種制度啊！牠作了一家不睦的導火綫····</p>
<p>雖然新的家庭日趨勃興的現在，一切舊的制度漸至粉碎，死亡。在新的家庭裏面，純以一夫一妻作單位。以純潔的感情，來互相督促，帮助，使其社會事業的發展和成功，這又是如何快樂的一件事！但是，在目前的中國，一般封建殘餘的思想，也很濃厚的存在着。我們只要睜眼一看··特别在農村裏面，所謂小姑制度，是如何的興盛着，殘存着呵！我們不看見報紙上，天天載着某地的童養媳，被公婆打死，和某地的，·····被丈夫唾棄嗎，以至自盡的消息嗎，所以我們要說中國的小姑制度没落殆盡了，這是没有的事！在舊式家庭裏，一般不睦的起因，均不能不歸罪於小姑的口舌的引禍，這是我敢斷言的事，和一般社會常有的現象。</p>
<p>目前我們若稍留心，不但農村，就是都市裏面，也常有着這種不幸的現象。老實說··在中國這樣的社會，什麽都是零亂的，半身不遂的病態現象，封建殘餘，還深深的埋藏在我們的腦海中，若是要一切舊有的制度，根本破壞，毁滅，死亡···我們是不能不將整個制度，努力的先澈底的推翻後，再重新的來建設，補償不行哩！</p>

<p>編者先生··</p>
<p>我是個很幼稚的女子，在小學還未曾畢業，就没有繼續入校讀書。</p>
<p>在民國十九年，那年我纔十多歲，由父母之命，嫁給一個素不相識的中年男子。自結婚以來，夫婦間毫無感情，但是他依仗他近親是在政界服務，就常常欺辱我，我祗是忍氣吞聲，在去年因細故他竟動野蠻的行爲打我，在打我之後的第二天，他就開我到外埠去了，到現在音信不通，（以上經過的情形，我祗寫個大略。）</p>
<p>這種痛苦我實不願再忍受下去，我曾要求他的近親和他脫離夫婦關係，可是他的近親回答我說··旣入他家的門庭，無論如何永不能使我稍有自由。</p>
<p>我曾想請律師解决，或法庭起訴，因爲我囊中分文無有，並且在此地又無親朋，如何可以辦得到呢！</p>
<p>只有求先生指示我個完全辦法，救我出這火坑。祝您精神愉快！</p>
<p>苗定貞二三，三，一日夜深　　答··編者曾屢次說過，結婚是應以愛情爲基礎，愛情破裂卽可離婚。但是在現社會却無從達到這種理想，其原因本信箱前已有討論，題名「爲什麽離婚會發生困難」，茲不贅述。苗女士這種情形，照理說是應該離婚，但在現行律下却不能離婚。所以「這種痛苦實不願再忍受下去」似乎也祇好繼續忍受下去，根本解决辦法是没有的。不過，根本辦法雖則没有，編者卻想到一個或許可以稍减痛苦的補救辦法。</p>
<p>我們認爲現社會上丈夫或其家庭所以能「欺辱」妻子或其媳婦，而妻子祇好「忍氣吞聲」者，其最大原因就是妻子須依賴丈夫過活，不能經濟獨立，如果經濟能够獨立，「這種痛苦」或許可以不會發生。所以我們認爲苗女士現在最好的辦法是僅可能去謀職　不要嫌事體小，酬報少，和太勞苦等等。如果你有了職業，自己經濟可以獨立，「他」就不能再「欺辱」你，卽使他來「欺辱」，你也不必再「忍氣吞聲」了，你儘可提出反抗，他眞的不講理，你也有錢請律師讓他吃官司，不致於「囊中分文無有」，不能至法庭起訴。</p>
<p>至於他的近親對你說的話，完全是胡說。自由是我們的權利，誰能加以限制！所以如果他們不許你謀職業自立，你不能讓步一分，須儘可能地對他們反抗，爭取「謀職業」與「經濟獨立」的自由。</p>
<p>總之，現在這種時代，隨處都會遇着困難，我們做事很少有「萬全之策」和「一帆順風」所以我們處處都要用破釜沉舟的精神，去解决困難你能不能不受他們屈服，就要看你有無這樣精神。</p>

<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>傍晚時分，突然一陣狂風挾着沙屑從窗口刮進來；幾乎使人不信中午時穿着夾衣還喊熱的三月中旬。忙着關窗，已有幾本課卷吹到地的中央。這本來是星期四發還學生的，我的脾氣從没有預先把要幹的事情早日做完，做等因奉此」的時候，也非逼着要東西纔肯動筆，這脾氣在朋友之間已出名「懶蟲」。　　今天氣候太好了，寒冬過來没有這般好的天，反使覺得一種難言的壓迫。同事們午後邀我游湖，我似乎鼓不起興緻，辭謝了獨自睡了個中學。醒來還是遍體不適，無聊的到校園裏散步。這三月的春天，花，樹，蝴蝶，甚至池沼，都滿富活躍的生氣，但是這異乎尋常的氣候的轉變，對於我似乎太不適合。墻角邊那株怒放的桃花，牠剛纔像妓女一般諂媚春風，現在恐怕滿掛着淚珠自弔薄命了吧！因爲我書桌前的玻璃窗上已打滿了雨點；我望不見牠飄落下來的花片，早已隨了池中的流水不知去向了吧！春，你一刹那的欣榮，倒没有冬那般的過後使人覺得凄凉的餘味。我像老年人一樣，滿懐惆悵的踱回臥室來，心中彷彿遺失了一件記不起來的可愛的東西，無可奈何地借校閱課卷驅除我的滿懷的煩惱。這一陣突如其來的狂風挾着大雨，氣候頓然降低了，心中反稍感爽快。換了衣架上的棉袍，靜坐着燃起捲烟來，窗外的雨愈下愈大了。</p>
<p>天色也漸暗下來，我索性闔上眼睛。獨坐聽雨聲，另有一番滋味在心頭，捲烟燒上指頭都没有覺得，自己的心彷彿溶化在這寗靜的黃昏裏。不知經過了多少時候，我似乎迷濛的被音樂樣的雨聲催眠過去，茶役推進門來說··</p>
<p>「朱先生，有女客。」</p>
<p>我遲疑地旋過身來，不及一秒鐘的時間内，努力想思索在杭州有否拜訪我的女客··</p>
<p>——去冬被朋友强逼我上滬杭車，來此擔任每週十二小時的英文敎員。那時我在上海養病，所以雖說被朋友强逼，一半也出於自願。變換一個環境或者可以變換我的心境；何况湖山景色的西子湖畔，是多麽美麗的一個療養所呵！幾個月來，怡然自得的踏雪尋梅，探幽登高，一切煩惱苦痛消滌殆盡，大有此間樂不思蜀，終老於是鄉之概。雖然在紅男綠女聯袂偕來的明媚的春天，我反而對電多麽美麗的環境可約西湖發生反感——這或者就是我常自　頭腦的一個大原因，但是我到這裏後—除了我的朋友之外，我没有通知過任何一個人，我也不願告訴任何一個人，在這一轉瞬間，那女客的修長身材已大踏步跳進房來，背着光綫我認不清她的容貌。</p>

<p>— 西復</p>
<p>或者是好萊塢是無心的。那位臨時演員，穿着馬夫的皮馬甲，拉了一匹高大黑馬，靜等着珍妮　諾來騎。這是在「小妹妹」（ＰＡＤＤＹ　　ＥＮＥＸＴＢＥＳＴＴＨＩＮＧ）的一幕。那位導演指揮着一切，他亦没有知道那個當馬夫的臨時演員是誰。我告訴你吧，他從前是位明星，現在爲飢寒所迫，已經不得不降格而求，在福斯公司裏做一個臨時演員。他滿面帶着風塵憔悴的神氣，眼睛裏充滿着悲哀。種種的不幸和失望，已經在他從前和樂融融的面容上，留下了不可磨滅的創痕，那是一切的化妝漆所不能掩蓋，一切的燈光所不能隱藏的。他不過是個臨員，他自己深切地了解，還要竭力去好好地做，在小小的角色做出再好没有的精神出來。他在一張片子裏，嘚到了三天的工作，對於公司當局肯這樣帮忙於他，他已經是感激涕零的了！</p>
<p>但是他在三年以前，並不十分過遠，他應賺過一星期二千五百金元的薪水；他還是個衆望所歸的明星哩。他的名字是派脫奥麻萊（ＰＡＴＯＭＡＬＬＥＹ），他曾做過“ＧＯＡＮＤＧＥＴＬＴ”和十幾張别的轟動一時的片子。但是現在三天的臨時工作，恐怕還是他幾個星期，幾個月，或竟是幾年來的第一次工作哩。他賺了幾塊錢，也許可以付付雜貨賬，也許小孩子等着要買鞋，也許口袋裏車錢没有了。</p>
<p>奥麻萊的不幸，那裏來的？並不是爲喝酒。並不是爲女人。並不是爲夜生活。並不是没有本事。爲的是什麽？第一是交易市塲。他的財産差不多都一掃而光了。後來他又從一個紅人手裏，買了一塊油田，不過那塊油田竟不出油。於是他竟買了一魄荒田，而最後的三萬塊金元，亦沉在水裏去了。他所得到的，不過是三萬塊錢的一張收據，就是那張收據，至今還在律師的手裏，現在他有一個老妻，三個孩子。他的房子典押了六千塊錢，但是不久典期滿了，他没有錢賺，房子就要歸債主了。從前六千塊錢，眞是不算什麽，他周濟朋友親戚，亦不知化過多少個六千塊，可是現在……已經今昔不同了……他已被影片公司和一切的朋友遺。忘了。昔日受過他恩惠的朋友·現在都避之若浼了……有時他打電話給他們，他們竟連電話都不來接。世態炎凉，人情冷暖，令人發一浩歎！不知道經過了多少時候，他還硬撑着塲面，不肯拿自己的困難宜示於人。他不肯作小演員，他一心想覓個主角做做，但是機會總不肯光臨這失了勢的人的門口。他總不肯和公司用人組去商量，因爲他覺得他有他的記錄，他的才能，决不能因爲他的不幸，而求人的憐恤。他亦知道做過明星的人，决不能再去做臨時演員，而一旦做了臨時演員，就萬難再做主角。但是飢寒克勝一切。奥麻萊竟不能一家數口的空肚皮，去和餓狼相鬥了。他於是向各大影片公司去走動着。他没有汽車，祇好坐電車，有的時候，還要走走路，省幾分錢。他亦遇見了好幾個昔日的明星，亦在各公司走動着尋些零星小事做做。他在「小妹妹」裏，找到了一件小事。他非常的感激。他說··「我一定要從頭再做起。自己吞没自己的驕傲，本來是很不容易的，但是我竟將自己的驕傲吞下去了。」噫好萊塢，到底你的心在那裏？</p>
<h3 id="c250">觀衆意見評「舞宫春夢」 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦子</p>
<p>在目前狀况之下，的確也只有這種片子可以存在，以輕微的筆調，描寫一些社會上不甚重要的方面，悲歡離合，博得一些人們的傷感和讚美嘆，雖然也暴露一些現社會下人生的痛苦方面，但那祗是不甚緊要的刻劃。</p>
<p>單就這個範圍講，那末這部片子不能不說是相當成功的。在技術方面，攝影方面，都有很優美的成就，尤其是全劇的結搆方面，極見其巧妙而緊凑。如舞塲馮經理，蔡曉峯的表妹陳秀文，以及趙玉泉張植之等，都在劇之前面一度出現，而後在重要處再現，使人不覺其突兀，入情入理，頗合乎事實的理想。其他在劇情的轉變與接觸處，也處處都能以極經濟的手段使其連合，而不覺冗煩，這是很可贊美的。但也有因爲求其劇情之前後凑合，而有時不免陷於過去故作草蛇灰綫的舊手法，如蔡曉峯李曼曼合影的跌碎，李曼曼說舞女兩字將葬送了我的一生，以照應以後蔡李二人終於不得完滿結合，這簡直是售小說中所通常運用的呼應法，方法未免太舊了。這點微覺不滿意。</p>
<p>演員表演方面，各人都有平均的成就。李曼曼離開蔡曉峯而去重作舞女時，一面撫摩着蔡曉峯，一面又爲着錢而不能不去作舞女，而舞塲經理則又在外焦急的等待着，悲慘的情景，充分的在她面部表現出來，我們可以看見她内心的衝突，是激劇到如何程度。這是全劇中表演最佳的一節。</p>
<p>總之，就大體而觀，這片子是有相當成就的。但我們看了之後，總不免有一種空洞的感覺，就是這片子内容太平淡了，雖然也刻劃了一些人生的苦惱，但那總不是最接近現實的，最緊要的，祇是一些不甚重要的描寫，他並不能給我們以更熱烈的更新鮮的刺戟。這是最大的遺憾。然而，在現狀之下，的確也只有這片種子才可以存在！</p>
<p>爲了錢，不能不去作舞女，也爲了錢，不能不再去作舞。錢壓倒了一切，也破壞了一切。蔡李的結合，終於不能不因錢而被犧牲。現社會下的物質關係，是多麽殘酷的打擊着一切人們呵。這，要算是本片中比較最重要的一點暗示了。然而，這暗示却是在題外的。</p>
<h3 id="c251">評「舞宫春夢」 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 綠意</p>
<p>「舞宫春夢」就是要描繪出「舞女」的痛苦和受社會的冷遇。本片裏的曼曼，就是一般舞女中的模型。你看吧··她雖被環境所迫而淪爲舞女，但她是無時不在想掙脫這付桎梏，而過一些「人」的生活。在遇到蔡曉峰後又怎樣始終忠誠地愛着他——雖然在描寫上未免有點誇大——但是，不論她的心如何要向上，她的愛如何地熱烈，而受到環境的待遇却仍然很是冷酷的。她旣被曉峰的父親視爲有辱門楣，更逃不出紈袴子的侮弄，這是社會决定了她的運命，也就是社會决定了一般弱女子的運命。</p>
<p>劇作者能摘取這個現實的題材把它搬上銀幕確是値得贊同，但在結束處當曉峰帶了他的表妹獄中來還她三百塊錢看來，顯然劇作者卽使不是有意歪曲，也是理解不够的，在前面旣把曼曼加於同情的描寫，那末這給束簡直是侮辱了她，這結束無異是告訴了我們曉峰是覺悟（？）了，且聽從了父親的敎訓而同表妹結合了。在這裏我們不要忘記，曉峰的父親是封建傳統觀念的代表者，因此作者是犯了爲封建說敎的重大嫌疑了。　　演出上是按照故事的發展加於平白的叙述，没有特出也没有厚非的地方。但是在悲劇發生以前用一種預兆來暗示；和爲了趣味用幾個噱頭我總覺得多餘的。原因是前者跡近迷信，後者破壞劇情。</p>
<p>還有一個缺點是字幕太多，對話太長，如「同居生活的開始」等字幕是可以不用的。</p>
<p>「拉斯蒲丁」描寫失實</p>
<h3 id="c252">米高梅被控始末 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 壯游</p>
<p>讀者們還記得吧，在去年暑期中，滬上嘗運到二張同名「拉斯蒲丁」的影片。一爲美國米高梅公司出品，巴里摩亞三姊弟所主演。一爲德國所攝製，主演者爲康拉維脫。然兩片皆爲租界當局所禁演。理由是恐怕引起僑滬白俄的糾紛。但後來德製的嘗一度移至華界上海戲院演映，而米高梅的，則始終未與我人相見。</p>
<p>兩片之内容，大致相同，故事皆採取歐戰時俄國宫闈之秘聞，描寫妖僧拉斯蒲丁之一生事跡。</p>
<p>今者，米高梅公司忽於上月二十七日於倫敦被控，原告者爲已故前俄皇之姪女，尤蘇蒲夫皇儲之妃，亞力山德羅夫娜公主。控訴原因，係「拉斯蒲丁」片中，有那泰沙公主一角，照所描劃觀之，實爲影射志她自身無疑。該片中言彼嘗爲拉所誘姦，且爲彼之情婦。妃認爲與彼名譽關係實大，故向倫敦皇家法庭控其譭謗之罪，並要求賠償名譽損失費四十萬元。</p>

<p>— 素梅</p>
<p>這時候皇宫的全部，俱在靜穆之中，這是暴風雨前的靜穆。不過暗中是驚人的消息頻傳着，大家都惴惴不可終日，預待着大禍之降臨。女沙皇病了，在衆御醫所見得的，她的末日是寥寥無幾的了。大公心裏暗暗好笑。女沙皇呢，終日終夜在床上翻騰着，口裏駡着··「你們这些惡神，你門想看着我死嗎！但我徧不死，我的壽比你們都長！」她雖然不能聽醫生的判决，但在宫墻之内，已經是隱懼四伏……怕的是什麽呢？就是因爲在眼前的將來，俄國將爲一個瘋人和他的戀婦所治理了。</p>
<p>有一天首相勃斯托乞夫跑到凱塞琳的寢宫裏，和凱塞琳作了一次秘密的談話。勃斯托乞夫並且帶了一個少年軍官來，是凱塞琳所不認識的。他說··「這是甲必丹渥露夫。等到時候一到，他就會率領了軍隊起事的。至於政府方面，自有我來擔負全責。」一回兒又有人敲着門，一個大祭士跑了進來，他誠誠懇懇地央求着凱塞琳道··「全國的敎會，都懇求你務必要採納首相的勸告」。凱塞琳對他們一個一個地看着，問他們道··「到底你們要呌我怎樣呢？」首相勃斯托乞夫開頭說道··「我們先要你答應，去將···唔···大公無論如何，不能使他做俄國的暴君。」凱塞琳道··「哦，那就是你們要我答應將我的丈夫處死呀。」她摇着頭，態度很堅决地說道··「那不興！」首相又說道··「大公要是活着，政爭就没有止息的一日。在我們這個長夜漫漫的俄國，將來的事情怎樣變化，就是一個癩皮的狼，亦都知道的。」凱塞琳很莊重地說道··「大公並没有害我，我豈肯隨便將他治死。」首相又懇切地求着，他說全國的人民都愛戴她，祇要她吩咐一句話，什麽天大的事，都可以辦到。但是，直到這時候，凱塞琳在纂取大權的企圖中，差不多已經成熟的時候，她還不肯殺戮一個人—他的丈夫大公彼得。她說··「我已發過誓，要盡忠於女皇陛下和她的法律承繼人，我豈能加害於大公！」她說完了，就將衆人打發走了。</p>
<p>在凱塞琳的寢室門外，她和亞萊克賽在樓梯口會見了。她很和氣地和他打着招呼，可是心中一陣隱痛，又發作了起來。她覺得這個欺騙她的人，她一定要設法懲治。亞萊克賽告訴凱塞琳，說他被女皇派遣出使外國，現在剛從波斯，印度回來。她看見他胸脯前又掛了一個簇新的勳章，她就和他道賀，但是當她想走開的時候，他將她止住了。他很誠懇地告訴凱塞琳道··「自從我回國之後，我就聽見了···現在我已確實知道···大公已有計劃，將你驅逐出宫，或者還許···更壞些，祇要他朝手握大權的時候！」（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Jin-Sui Army Advances Towards Shizuizi <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Ding Futing Arrives in Ningcheng to Negotiate Surrender</p>
<p>Ji Pang Hu Plans to Telegraph Sun Again with Advice</p>
<p>Sun Dianying Stays Fu Zhankui in Attempt at Last-Ditch Maneuver</p>
<p>Guihua: On the morning of the 17th, the Jin-Sui army attacked Dengkou and, after a fierce battle until 5:00 PM, completely occupied Dengkou. They are currently pursuing towards Shizuizi. Shizuizi is a crucial defensive position for the enemy, and Sun's army has pre-built solid fortifications. It is expected that there will be fierce fighting in the Shizuizi area within the next few days. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 19th) (Beiping): A certain agency received a telegram from Ningxia dated the 18th stating: (1) Sun's 117th Division Commander Ding Futing arrived in Ningxia yesterday, met with Ma Hongkui to discuss surrender, and an agreement has been reached, which will be announced via telegram for a change of allegiance. (2) The situation in Pingluo, Ningxia, remains unchanged. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): A telegram from Baotou states that the Jin-Sui army's offensive against Sun is very strong, and the fighting has been going smoothly in recent days. Sun, feeling excessively pressured by the Jin-Sui army and for the sake of self-preservation, seems unwilling to allow Fu Zhankui to return to Beiping immediately, hoping to keep him a little longer in an attempt to make a last-ditch maneuver. Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengzhou will soon be stationed in Dengkou, and it is rumored that the headquarters will move from Wuyuan to Linhe. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Due to the pincer attack by the Jin-Sui and Ningxia forces, as well as the bombing by aircraft, Sun's army has suffered heavy casualties, and morale is low. Their combat effectiveness is gradually weakening. Sun's army has indicated that a solution may be realized in the short term. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): A telegram from Ningxia states that Sun Dianying still has no sincere intention to leave the army. Sun's forces surrounding Pingluo have been concentrating artillery fire on the city in recent days. Sun's forces in the Ningxia area have also repeatedly launched attacks on Ma's army's positions. A certain division and brigade of the Central Army have arrived in Ningxia, and Deputy Division Commander Peng Jinzhi has also arrived in Ningxia to meet with Ma to discuss a counter-offensive. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Military News: It is reported that Zuo Yiyi telegraphed from Wuyuan on the 17th stating that he arrived in Wuyuan this afternoon. He recently received a phone call from Linhe stating that our army occupied Dengkou at 5:00 PM this afternoon. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Hu Yukun stated that Ji Yiqiao, Pang Bingxun, and he are quite unhappy with Sun Dianying's delay in leaving the army. He plans to meet with Ji this evening to discuss a mutually acceptable solution to this matter and to consult with He Yingqin for advice. Rumors that he and others have telegraphed Fu Zhankui with proposed solutions are inaccurate. Fu has already arrived in Pingluo. They still believe that a peaceful resolution to the Sun issue is not hopeless. They believe that after another round of negotiations between Fu and Sun, the situation should become more concrete. Whether they need to telegraph Fu again will be determined after consulting with He. Ji and Hu decided to telegraph Fu again to relay to Sun that the authorities' approach to resolving the issue of Sun's forces remains unchanged. They requested that Sun be informed to decide for himself and not to go astray. If Sun can leave the army, there will be no problem with living expenses. They hope Sun can consider both public and private interests and seek a win-win solution. The draft telegram will be presented to He for review this evening and can be sent in a day or two.

<h3 id="e6">Continued Increase in Japanese Troops in Eastern Chahar <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Advancing Along a Scissor-Shaped Route</p>
<p>Seemingly Possessing Designs to Encompass Inner Mongolia</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan and Qin Dechun Consult He and Huang for Instructions</p>
<p>(Beiping): There has been a further increase in Japanese troops in Eastern Chahar. The 8th Division of the Japanese Army, originally stationed along the Rehe border, is currently in the process of being relieved by the 7th Division. The main force in the Duolun area is the puppet army under Li Shouxin. In the Guyuan 24th District, 500 Japanese troops, previously deployed there, remain stationed. There have been no active operations in recent days. However, based on their recent movements, it is clear that they have designs on Eastern Chahar. It is reported that the Japanese military plan is to form a scissor shape, with Duolun as the center. One route will advance northwestward along the Duolun-Kulun axis, attempting to encompass Xilingol League and occupy Inner Mongolia in order to threaten the Soviet Union. The other route will develop southward along the Guyuan 24th District. The situation is not to be ignored. Although the Japanese main target is the Soviet Union, it will inevitably infringe upon China's territorial sovereignty. The Chahar authorities, being responsible for defending the territory, cannot ignore this and have requested that the Political Reorganization Committee take responsibility for negotiating with the Japanese to avoid incidents. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Qin Dechun stated that the Japanese troops' increase in the Guyuan 24th District is justified by the reorganization of Zhang Renjie's affairs. However, the increase in troops came first, and Zhang's affairs came after, so the justification is untenable. Li Shouxin's forces in the Duolun area number approximately 8,000 to 9,000 men. The Japanese have established a special intelligence agency there, and Li concurrently serves as the puppet Chahar Eastern Garrison Commander. The troop increase is currently being negotiated with the Japanese by our authorities. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Jiang Bocheng visited Song Zheyuan this morning for a long talk and then accompanied him to Jurentang to consult with He regarding the Chahar problem. In the afternoon, he visited Huang Fu, and Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, and Jiang Bocheng were also present. Huang also hosted a banquet to welcome Song. Song will return to Chahar with Xiao Zhenying within the next few days. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): This morning, Song Zheyuan and Qin Dechun visited He, reported on the situation in Eastern Chahar, and sought instructions on how to respond. He stated that the Chahar problem has been entrusted to the Political Reorganization Committee, which is negotiating with the Japanese. The Japanese troops in the Guyuan 24th District may be withdrawn in the short term. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): This morning, Qin Dechun arrived from Zhangjiakou to visit Song Zheyuan and report on everything. Huang Fu hosted a banquet at the Foreign Affairs Building at noon to entertain Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, and others. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Nima and other representatives of the Mongolian Chahar Banner visited Song this morning to report on the results of their petition in Nanjing. Song sent Guo Zhihan to meet with them on his behalf. In addition to stating the purpose of their visit, the representatives requested that Duolun be taken over as soon as possible. Guo stated that he would relay the message. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Japanese troops stationed in Shimenzhai, Jianchangying, and Shaheqiao have not yet prepared to withdraw. Recently, another 700 to 800 Japanese troops, carrying weapons, have been added to Xifengkou. Their intentions are unclear. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<p>Sino-American Treaty Negotiations Still Pending</p>
<p>(Beiping): American Ambassador Johnson hosted a luncheon at the embassy for Tang Youren on the 19th. It is reported that Tang discussed the revision of the Sino-American Treaty with the American ambassador yesterday. Our government previously sent a note to the American ambassador, presenting the key points for revision, but has not yet received a reply from the American government. It will still be difficult to begin revisions in the near future. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Tang Youren stated that he feels the diplomatic crisis in North China has not been resolved and that a solution to diplomacy requires improved domestic affairs. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Tang Youren is scheduled to leave Beiping for Tianjin tomorrow, stay there briefly, and then return to Nanjing. This afternoon, Tang, accompanied by his secretary Zhang Pingqun, visited various embassies and parties to bid farewell. Tang's trip to the north was originally intended to inspect East Hebei and investigate the actual situation, but due to the short time, it was cancelled. He plans to report the results of this northern inspection to the Central Government after returning to Nanjing. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing): A Jiji Press dispatch from Tianjin on the 15th stated that Huang Fu resigned, and Tang Youren's trip to the north, while ostensibly to inspect North China, was actually to persuade Huang to stay and to propose solutions to the outstanding issues between China and Japan in addition to the issues of traffic and postal. After inquiring with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was learned that Huang Fu has not resigned to the Central Government. Tang's trip is to inspect the recent diplomatic situation in the north and has no other missions. The Jiji Press report is not factual. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<p>The Tibetan Army's Eastern Offense Was Initiated by Unemployed Lamas</p>
<p>Hotig Sends a Telegram to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Promising Strict Prevention</p>
<p>Zhao Pilian Formulates a Plan to Resolve the Tibetan Issue</p>
<p>(Nanjing): According to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, unemployed lamas from Dajin Temple in Western Kang suddenly crossed the Tongtian River and attacked Guanyin Temple in Derge and other places last month. The offensive was fierce, but Liu Wenhui's troops were unable to resist. For the past ten days, the two sides have been deadlocked. It is reported that this unfortunate event was entirely due to the instigation of unemployed lamas, and the Tibetan authorities do not seem to have any intention of aggression, unlike the previous Kang-Tibetan war. Therefore, the war will not escalate and may soon be pacified. Furthermore, Hotig, the political and religious leader of Tibet, telegraphed the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, stating in brief that the Tibetan side had not received any reports of the actions of the unemployed lamas of Dajin Temple. The truth could not be predicted, but it was feared that these lamas had no shelter or food and had resorted to this desperate measure. However, he would uphold the principle of Sino-Tibetan friendship and strictly prevent such actions. After receiving the telegram, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission forwarded it to the Executive Yuan for review. As for the lamas of the temple, Dajin Temple was burned down during the Kang-Tibetan War in the 20th year, leaving all 3,000 people homeless and living in hardship, often engaging in illegal activities. In order to avoid future troubles and resolve this dispute, the Central Government plans to first order them to cease military conflict and then take them in and provide for their livelihood, but they must disarm. As for the detailed methods and implementation steps, they will be jointly decided by the relevant agencies. Zhao Pilian, the representative of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, has formulated a resolution proposal and submitted it to the Central Government for approval. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing): The Tibetan Office in Nanjing received a reply telegram from the Tibetan Kashag, stating that Tibet had not received any reports of the Tibetan army and monks of Da Jie Temple causing trouble by crossing the river in Sichuan and Kang.

This move could result in the purchase of railway materials from Britain. Simon made this statement in response to a question from Conservative Party Member of Parliament Lanzin.

<p>(Nanjing): British Ambassador Cadogan visited our diplomatic authorities again on the 19th. Regarding the Yunnan border mining rights negotiations, the trend is for both sides to stop the dispute, wait for both sides to send personnel to investigate, demarcate the Yunnan-Burma border first, and then discuss other matters. On the evening of the 19th, Cadogan hosted a banquet for our military and political dignitaries at the British Consulate. He laid a wreath at the Mausoleum this morning and will go to Shanghai on the 26th to pick up his family and go to Beiping at the beginning of next month. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing): British Ambassador Cadogan is scheduled to visit the Mausoleum to lay a wreath at 10:00 AM on the 20th, accompanied by Lin Tongshi, Section Chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The British ambassador was originally scheduled to go to Shanghai to welcome his family to Beiping within the next few days, but he has changed his itinerary and will not leave Nanjing for the time being. He has also telegraphed the Beiping embassy to request a case study. It is rumored that the British ambassador's move is in accordance with government instructions to discuss the revision of the commercial treaty and the Pan Hong case with us.

<p>Destroy Electric Lights and Boilers in Mine Shafts</p>
<p>Military Police Announce Temporary Martial Law</p>
<p>Clash Between Workers and Worker Representatives</p>
<p>(Tianjin): A general strike broke out in the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan early on the 19th. Workers destroyed electric lights and boilers in the mine shafts before dawn, causing the entire city's lights to go out and plunging it into darkness. The Tangshan Public Security Bureau and the War Zone Security Team were dispatched in full force to implement martial law. Both the east and west ends of Guangdong Street, the workers' residential area, were guarded by armed police. The gates of the Public Security Bureau were tightly closed to prevent workers from rioting. The strike was due to a conflict between the workers and worker representatives and was unrelated to the mine owners. After the previous two strikes, the worker representatives had signed agreements with the mine owners without authorization, which angered the workers. The mine owners had issued a loss of ten yuan to each person, but the workers had not received it. The worker representatives then deducted this money, claiming it would be used for union expenses, which the workers refused to accept, leading to the strike. This matter was supposed to break out on the evening of the 18th, but when Zhao Yuan, the director of the Public Security Bureau, found out, he urgently arrested Shang Peirong and two other worker representatives in an attempt to ease the situation. However, they were suddenly released in the evening, which angered the workers. On the 19th, they gathered to surround the Public Security Bureau, demanding the handover of the three representatives. At the same time, the workers stopped work and released water into the mine shafts to show their strength. Another group of radical workers surrounded the union, searching for the three representatives with wooden sticks and other weapons. Because the three had escaped in advance, they were not found. Currently, the workers are firmly demanding that the Public Security Bureau hand over the three representatives, otherwise they will not resume work. Tangshan has therefore declared temporary martial law today. Zhao Xun telegraphed the province to request instructions on how to handle the matter. Zha Yao, the acting chairman of the province, ordered Tao Shangming, who was staying in Tianjin, to return to Tangshan quickly on the 20th to mediate the situation. The Tangshan Public Security Bureau believes that the Kailuan strike has a communist background and arrested Zhang Zhenfu on the 19th. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing): Liu Ruiheng returned to Nanjing from Jiangxi on the 19th to discuss matters. His trip to Jiangxi was to reorganize and improve military medical affairs. After discussing with the relevant responsible personnel, it was proposed to organize epidemic prevention teams, surgical teams, X-ray teams, and automobile transport teams to be sent to the front lines to handle military hygiene. It was also proposed to add serious illness hospitals in the rear and improve army hospitals and seriously injured hospitals. After returning to Nanjing, he will proceed according to the plan.

<h3 id="e22">The Development of China's Economy Depends on Collective Strength and Caution <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is known as China's economic center. Needless to say, it is a manifestation of China's prosperity. However, since the global economic panic unfolded, Shanghai has also been severely affected. This impact became gradually apparent after the January 28th Incident. Especially since the last quarter of last year, it has become difficult to sustain. Recently, the most obvious manifestations are: (1) Store closures are increasing daily. Many well-established large businesses are also forced to liquidate. (2) Industrial operations are extremely difficult. Especially silk factories, with less than one-tenth able to continue operations. (3) The financial industry feels slow circulation, yet cannot but be cautious in lending. Consequently, the business community feels even greater difficulty, further highlighting the market's decline. If the above three situations persist, they will lead to an increase in unemployment and a general deterioration of living conditions. This will then be reflected in the commercial, industrial, and financial markets, making the situation even more severe.</p>
<p>Originally, Shanghai's development, viewed from the perspective of capitalist organization, was not a natural phenomenon. Because the development of such a large city should be centered around industrial development, providing a foundation for the national economy. However, everyone knows that Shanghai's development is primarily based on import and export trade. The majority of imports are industrial products, while the majority of exports are raw materials. Recently, there has been a peculiar shift: grains and flour have become major import commodities. The development of such a large city relying on buying and selling, depending on others for a living, is extremely dangerous. A city that relies on commercial development faces two dangers. First, in terms of imports, the main driving force is largely in the hands of others. We have no power of our own to control. Moreover, since the opening of sea trade, the transportation in our mainland, from waterways to railways, has been manipulated by foreigners. If the global economic panic is difficult to remedy, we will be the last to be sacrificed. Second, in terms of exports, we are even more subject to others' control. Because of our weak manufacturing capacity, overseas trade is also controlled by others. Not only are we unable to expand overseas markets, but we are also subject to exclusion. The sales of raw silk and silk fabrics being seized by Japanese products is clear evidence. Furthermore, foreign capital invests in China in transportation, industry, textile industry, political loans, and cultural investments. The payment of debt interest can endanger the entire Chinese economy. Therefore, Shanghai's abnormal prosperity, based on commerce, is more severely affected by the economic panic than advanced countries in the current situation. To try to save or temporarily stabilize it requires more effort than countries with an industrial base.</p>
<p>Observing the economic situation of Shanghai and other cities in China, this is not a temporary phenomenon. Nor can it be restored after a certain period. Because the current economic decline is fundamentally due to inherent contradictions in the economic structure itself and stems from the collapse of the most basic rural economy. Therefore, the vast majority of people, from farmers in the countryside to small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators in the city, are all trapped in difficult living conditions, unable to find a proper way out. Moreover, there is external pressure. Capitalist countries all want to redevelop in this market to seek their own economic balance. As a result, the revival of China's national economy becomes even more difficult.</p>
<p>However, we still have a glimmer of hope: we still have many undeveloped areas. We still have inexhaustible mineral resources. As long as the general public has a slight surplus in their lives, domestic consumption will naturally increase. Our agriculture certainly cannot continue to develop in the form of handicrafts, but with a little mechanical assistance, we can hope for a huge harvest. Our water transportation and railways all have ample room for development. The general society is waiting to accept this development and is willing to work hard in the development process. The reason why it cannot be realized immediately is that the political situation has not yet reached complete stability, and private operations are still difficult to start. Furthermore, most people only seek to maintain the status quo. As for implementing a controlled economy using state power, all preparations have not yet begun. Of course, it is difficult to implement it immediately. Now, it is necessary to develop industry and rural areas in a balanced way and to consider external relations. Individual capabilities are insufficient even in advanced European and American countries. In our China, we must rely on collective strength. The development of a collective economy and the balanced planning of industrial and agricultural economies are essential. However, the effective and efficient implementation of a collective effort is the most urgent task.</p>

<p>Asia is Considered its Periphery</p>
<p>The League of Nations and Disarmament are Interdependent</p>
<p>Rome - Today is the opening of the second five-year congress of the Italian Fascist Party. At four o'clock in the morning, Roman bugles sounded, calling on party members to prepare to attend. Approximately seven thousand key Italian Fascist Party members gathered in the Grand Theater to welcome party leader Mussolini. Amidst thunderous applause, Mussolini stood up and delivered a speech, stating that opening up Africa would be the work of Italians in the future. He said that Italy does not have a problem of conquering land. Italy, the country of Fascism, should not allow countries that create this problem to block its spiritual and economic development.</p>
<p>Mussolini spoke about foreign policy, saying that Austria can rely on Italy to maintain its independence and assist in its economic reform. Italy and Yugoslavia can also improve their relations when the environment is appropriate. As for the unresolved issues between Italy and France, although there has not been any real progress toward a resolution, relations between the two countries are constantly improving. The reform of the League of Nations depends on the outcome of the disarmament conference. If this conference fails, then the League of Nations does not need to be reformed, because the failure of disarmament is enough to announce the end of the League of Nations. Countries that are armed cannot, of course, oppose the implementation of the equal rights granted to Germany in 1932.</p>
<p>Mussolini also said that Italy's disarmament memorandum is a very reasonable plan to promote understanding between large and small European countries. Without this understanding, Europe will be doomed and headed towards darkness. Mussolini continued by saying that it is important for Italy to find a way out in Africa and spoke of the possibility of cooperation with Asia, saying that Italy is only a few hours away from Africa and Asia by sea, and even less by plane. Mussolini said that the mission he entrusts to modern and future Italians should not be misunderstood. This is not a matter of land conquest, but of natural expansion to lead to the cooperation of Italy with the people of Africa and the East. It is also a matter of using the infinite resources of Africa and Asia to introduce civilization to the world. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e26">Mussolini Reiterates His Proposal to Revise Treaties <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Supplement to the Italy-Austria-Hungary Protocol</p>
<p>Hungary Confronts the Little Entente</p>
<p>Rome - In a speech this morning to prospective members of the Chamber of Deputies, Mussolini's section on Hungary is generally regarded as a supplement to the political protocol agreed upon by Italy, Austria, and Hungary yesterday. Because when the leaders of the three countries were negotiating in Rome, some major problems arose from the Hungarian side. At that time, Hungary argued that the protocol answered by Hungary should mention the revision of the peace treaty. Subsequently, the treaty terms did not mention the revision of the peace treaty. This is an omission method. It was agreed that the day after the treaty was signed, the Italian government would issue a declaration on this issue. The nature of Mussolini's speech this morning regarding Hungary is equivalent to this declaration. In this speech, the leader of the Italian government stated that he supported the return to Hungary of the territory of the Magyars (i.e., Hungarians) that was ceded to the Little Entente countries by the peace treaty. This is a kind of guarantee from Italy to Hungary. According to estimates in diplomatic circles, Mussolini has made many declarations regarding the revision of the peace treaty. This statement is only a restatement of previous declarations and does not imply that Italy, Austria, and Hungary are negotiating to confront the Little Entente. Not only do various newspaper commentaries and the preface to the political protocol recognize that the agreement signed yesterday is the starting point for broader negotiations, but Mussolini himself solemnly stated this point in his speech this morning. Hungary has always believed that it cannot cooperate with the Little Entente countries alone, and that even economic cooperation is impossible. The concern is that doing so would entail losing some of Hungary's independence, or at least its moral independence. Now that there is a tripartite agreement, if Hungary cooperates with the Little Entente, Austria and Italy will back it, and Hungary will no longer oppose cooperation. And judging from Mussolini's speech, Italy has already admitted its hope that Hungary will cooperate with the Little Entente countries. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>Believed to be Enough to Aggravate the Turbulent Situation</p>
<p>(Paris) - The French press expressed surprise at Mussolini's speech. While the French press does not object to the tripartite agreement, it believes that Italy's remarks regarding the Treaty of Versailles strongly advocate treaty revision, and that its hopes for an Italian-French understanding are in vain. Le Journal de Paris stated that Mussolini's speech seemed to want to impose his will on the world. Le Petit Parisien stated that Mussolini's remarks will create a turbulent atmosphere and feelings of disappointment. Le Figaro stated that France has tried to understand Italy's position, but Mussolini's remarks did not express any understanding towards France. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - News of the speech delivered last night by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the National Opera House to prospective members of the Chamber of Deputies has arrived here, and the entire French press regards it with great disappointment. Le Petit Parisien wrote, "Is it possible for the Italian Prime Minister to improve relations between Italy and Yugoslavia while describing the exploitation of isolated Hungary? The result will only make the Little Entente countries unhappy. At this time, Italy wants to spiritually improve the atmosphere and establish an understanding with the Little Entente countries, but how can it be content with the status quo and blame each other for accumulating problems that are difficult to reverse? Furthermore, the Italian Prime Minister's words, on the one hand, praised Italy's military strength while mentioning the disarmament conference, and his tone was extremely firm, as if giving orders. Its self-contradiction is self-evident. The declaration of this intention will only create an atmosphere of turbulence and a psychology of disappointment." Le Petit Journal expressed its opinion, saying that the Italian Prime Minister's intention to revise the peace treaty is obvious, which will hinder the progress of future negotiations. L'Écho de Paris expressed deeper disappointment, saying that Mussolini's remarks have never been so abrupt. He failed to adopt a peaceful attitude with a calm mind because he has proposed many initiatives in diplomacy over the past year, most of which have failed. This is why he encouraged the emotions of the audience with frantic words. The leftist newspaper Le Nouveau Siècle also held the same view, saying, "In the future, France should adopt only one attitude, that is, adhering to the consistent principle of security guarantees. What is the principle? That is, disarmament progress is impossible until security guarantees are obtained. As for the Four-Power Pact, it no longer exists. It has been sent to the grave by Mussolini. Mussolini concluded a political agreement with Austria and Hungary without first consulting the signatory countries of the pact." The socialist newspaper Le Populaire criticized, saying that Mussolini firmly ordered that the country should reach military strength and concentrate the lives of the entire country on military force. Mussolini's intention is to allow us to regard this as a lesser harm. What a strange mentality! (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>

On the contrary, it is to solve the major economic problems in the Danube River basin and restore natural economic conditions under the current political system. The natural economic conditions were destroyed by the last World War. This is one of the main reasons for the economic panic in the Danube River basin. Therefore, our goal is cooperation, not struggle. I am convinced that the results of the Rome talks have brought us closer to this goal." (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Budapest - Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös returned here from Rome at 10:30 this evening. During a radio broadcast speech, he briefly stated that when he took office as Prime Minister, he criticized the European Union plan proposed by the late French Foreign Minister Briand, believing that the plan was too ambitious and that there were many obstacles to its implementation. At that time, he advocated a simpler and easier-to-implement plan. The purpose of this trip to Rome was nothing more than to realize this concept. All agreements made in Rome are completely open, and all countries can join. The governments of Italy, Austria, and Hungary also tried to eliminate the tendency of economic isolationism during the Rome talks. Therefore, Hungary's political and economic status will be greatly enhanced as a result. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>France Captures German Spy</p>
<p>(London) - The press has made a comprehensive observation of recent international diplomatic events and believes that the opinions between France and Germany on the disarmament issue are mutually different, and it is difficult to hope for an easing of the international situation. The Daily Telegraph stated that the discord between Berlin and Paris is particularly disappointing. The report also said, "If the success or failure of the disarmament conference depends on France's demands for security, then the prospects for the future are particularly bleak, as it is generally known that Britain cannot make any other promises on the security issue." The News Chronicle also stated that Britain cannot recognize the intention to provide security again. However, The Daily Mail believed that France's response was completely normal. The Times stated that it was very gratifying that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini decided to guarantee Austria's independence. The report also stated that the policies of Britain and Italy were parallel and did not conflict on the issue of Austria's independence and other points. In addition, The Daily Telegraph and the News Chronicle believe that the policies implemented by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini contain a crisis and are particularly worrying. (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - The French press welcomed the French government's reply to the British disarmament memorandum, pointing out that this was a clear and resolute demonstration of French foreign policy since the establishment of the Doumergue government. Parisian public opinion unanimously opposes any compromise that would allow Germany to rearm while reducing France's arms. It is also believed that Germany's recent reply to Britain still insists on its demands in their entirety. It is reported that Germany still does not recognize the nature and value of its paramilitary groups and evades providing the necessary information on its organization and management. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) - The German newspapers all attributed the blame for the failure of the disarmament talks to France, because France has misunderstandings on several points. The German Posener Tageblatt stated that if France rejects Germany's reply, then Germany will have to find ways to protect its demands for self-defense. The Deutsche Tageszeitung stated that France equates German national groups with French soldiers who have been trained and continues to demand new guarantees from other countries, which is absurd. Germany's policy in the past year has removed various obstacles between France and Germany. What will happen in the future is only decided by France. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>

The second is a military agreement. In order to implement the Rhine Security Pact, another military agreement should be concluded with France so that Belgium can concentrate its military forces to defend itself in the event of a sudden attack.

<p>Only Four Battleships Currently</p>
<p>(Berlin) - Germany's navy has always been bound by the Treaty of Versailles, but the strength of the German navy is still less than the limit allowed by the Treaty of Versailles. According to the treaty, Germany can have eight battleships, but in reality, Germany only has four battleships serving in the country. Among those four battleships, three belonged to the former Imperial Navy. The other one is the famous pocket battleship "Deutschland." Its speed is 26 knots per hour, and it is equipped with 18 cannons. There are currently two similar pocket battleships under construction. Germany has four brand-new cruisers in service, each displacing 6,000 tons, and three old cruisers as reserves. Among the reserve ships, there is also an "Emden" displacing 5,400 tons, which is currently being repaired in the dock. According to the provisions of the treaty, Germany can have eight cruisers. Germany currently has twelve torpedo boats in service, each displacing 800 tons, and four old torpedo boats are in reserve. The maximum limit stipulated by the treaty is 24 torpedo boats. However, Germany has no submarines or aircraft carriers because it is restricted by the treaty. In addition to the above-mentioned fleet, the rest of the German naval ships are insignificant. The Treaty of Versailles limits the German naval military strength to 15,000 tons. Germany's attitude towards maritime armaments is the same as that of land armaments. Germany has expressed dissatisfaction with its own disarmament, so it insists on the reduction of armaments by other countries. Germany's foreign policy is to demand equal rights and stop all countries from discriminating against Germany. Therefore, if all countries have submarines and aircraft carriers, then Germany should also have these rights, because this matter is related to Germany's national system and security. On the other hand, even if Germany adopts a plan to revitalize the navy, there is no hope of implementing and competing with other countries in naval shipbuilding.

It is reported that the accomplices include people from all social classes, from nobles to others. The defendants have hired fifty lawyers, and four hundred people have been summoned to testify. This is truly one of the most shocking cases in Europe after the war. It was found that former Prime Minister Duca was assassinated at the Sinaia station on December 30 after meeting with King Carol, and died on the spot.

<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi Establishes an Investigation Agency</p>
<p>Must Ask About Domestic Affairs and Diplomacy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Based on the intentions of Minister of the Army Hayashi, the army will establish a large investigation agency to deliberate on national policy after the parliament is closed. After the investigation results are determined, the military authorities' requirements will be submitted to the government. Minister of the Army Hayashi has generally followed the policies of his predecessors, but the army's views on the internal affairs conference are only abstract and conceptual, without proposing any specific cases. Although Minister of the Army has views about the current domestic and international situation and is not contradictory to those of former Minister of the Army Araki, if he only vaguely discusses without proposing a concrete case as the representative of the army, it will only make the situation more confusing. Therefore, he decided to speak from this perspective, carrying an irrefutable case, presenting it to the government, and gradually urging the government to research and implement it. This is the conclusion that Minister of the Army has recently reached. As for the name of the investigation committee, it is probably the Military and Political Investigation Committee, which is actually presided over by Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau, Major General Tetsuzan Nagata. The investigation items not only include domestic issues, but also external issues. All agencies will mobilize and turn the results of the investigation into conclusions. Therefore, it will take considerable time for the investigation committee to produce a conclusion. Minister of the Army Hayashi has personally come forward to deliberate on national policy, and it is expected that its impact will be great, so all parties attach great importance to it.

<p>Roosevelt's Advisor Rogers to Depart Soon</p>
<p>To Study the Economy in China, Not Responsible for Negotiations</p>
<p>(Washington) With President Roosevelt's approval, the Department of Treasury is now sending currency expert Professor Rogers to China</p>
<p>to investigate the silver situation. Professor Rogers is President Roosevelt's trusted advisor and a proponent of currency control policies. He will depart soon. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that Professor Rogers' trip to China does not imply any qualification for official negotiations; he will only focus on studying the economy. As soon as Rogers' mission to China was announced, the silver proposals of Representatives Dyer and others, which had been opposed by the Department of Treasury, were introduced in the House. Speaker of the House Rainey expects the bill to pass with a majority, but some believe that this bill will cause a violent conflict. (Reuter's, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e37">American Labor-Management Conflict <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>A Major Problem in the Recovery Process</p>
<p>The Government Faces a Dilemma</p>
<p>(Washington) The beginning of this week is filled with labor-management conflict crisis. Although Congress has many important bills this week, they all seem insignificant compared to the brewing labor unrest. The automobile industry is at the forefront of commercial recovery, and the railway industry is the lifeline of national transportation, and there are rumors of labor unrest in both. Yesterday, one million railway workers, represented by 21 labor unions, rejected the proposal of the Railway Bureau Committee to continue reducing wages by one-eleventh for another ten months after the end of June. At the same time, American Federation of Labor President Green claimed that if automobile factories still do not recognize the union, 100,000 automobile factory workers will strike on March 21. National Recovery Administration General Johnson is scheduled to go to New York tomorrow to attend the labor-management conference in the automobile industry, hoping to find a way to prevent the strike from happening. The attitude of the railway union is also particularly worrying. A few weeks ago, President Roosevelt said that wages would still be paid according to the current regulations, but the union replied that railway workers have sacrificed a lot, while railway shareholders have benefited a lot during this recovery period, so they will not agree to extend the wage reduction plan for another ten months. What the railway industry is fighting for is wages, while the focus of the automobile industry dispute is the union. According to Article 7 of the Recovery Administration's automobile industry regulations, workers have the right to organize unions without interference, restraint, or threat from employers. Now automobile owners are organizing company unions, which obviously violates this provision, so the owners' position is vulnerable to attack on this point. If the authorities amend this provision, workers who have already joined the union can be exempted from the obligation to pay union fees, which is unacceptable to the leaders of the AFL. Furthermore, if the owners can maintain their company unions, the power of the AFL will be reduced, and its opportunity to expand will also decrease. However, if the owners are stubborn and the government has to declare company unions illegal, then employers' threats to labor will inevitably occur, causing endless disputes. American labor has only had a partial connection with extreme political ideologies in its history, which is different from other industrialized countries. However, if the United States enters a stage of severe labor-management conflict, this situation will not be maintained for long. Therefore, although Congress has the Philippine Independence Act, the Cotton Tax Act, the Securities Exchange Management Act, and the Naval Appropriation Act, which are all important events that need to be dealt with urgently, their importance pales in comparison to the impending labor unrest.

<h3 id="e38">Four Major American Bills <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Listed on the Congressional Agenda for Voting Today</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Congress has placed the four most recent major bills on the agenda. These four bills have been studied by hundreds of experts, and once voted on, the direction Congress will take in the future will be clearly indicated. The four major bills are as follows: (1) The Bankhead Cotton Restriction Act, which proposes to impose a restriction tax on cotton production exceeding 10,000,000 bales. (2) The Philippine Independence Act, which is a revision of the previous Philippine Independence Act (agreed upon by Senator Quezon, Chairman of the Philippine Independence Movement Committee, President Roosevelt, and congressional leaders). (3) The Fessinger Silver Purchase Act, which authorizes the Department of Treasury to purchase silver as a currency reserve and to issue silver securities that can be exchanged for silver bars equal to the price of gold. (4) The Thomas Silver Act, which authorizes the government to pay for foreign purchases of American surplus agricultural products with silver at a price higher than the world market price. According to Bankhead and Jones, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, today, the Bankhead Cotton Restriction Act can be passed safely tomorrow. However, observers predict that the number of votes for and against the bill will be very close, because Republican congressmen strongly oppose the bill, calling it "authoritarian" and "un-American," because some Democratic congressmen also sympathize with the Republicans' actions, as they are quite opposed to mandatory production cuts. The government hopes that the Philippine Independence Act can be passed in both the Senate and the House of Representatives tomorrow. The bill will be discussed before the silver bills and should not cause any problems. The bill will extend the previous Philippine Independence Act, which expired on January 17, to October 17, and also proposes to withdraw American land and naval bases in the Philippines in ten years. The outcome of the vote on the two silver bills tomorrow may be problematic, as President Roosevelt conducted eleven hours of secret research beforehand and his attitude is unknown. However, observers believe that the Thomas bill has a better chance of passing, because Fess's silver bill contains amendments to the government's current monetary plan. According to Thomas himself, in a conversation with an Associated Press reporter, he is confident that his proposed silver bill can be passed. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira, stating that during the meeting with British Trade Secretary Runciman on the 15th, he was personally handed a memorandum by the Trade Secretary, the content of which is as follows: It is extremely regrettable that the Sino-British private cotton industry talks have broken down. The convening of these talks was originally the fervent hope of cotton industry colleagues. If they are completely separated at this point, then industry colleagues may place significant pressure on the government (raising difficult issues for the government). What are the views of the Japanese government regarding this important situation, and what are its specific plans? Please advise. (Domei News Agency, 19th)</p>

<p>To Make Life Simple and Orderly</p>
<p>Hoping for United Efforts to Promote It</p>
<p>(Nanchang) On the morning of the 19th, the Garrison Headquarters held a memorial week. Provincial education directors, secretaries-general, administrative commissioners, and generals who came to Jiangxi for training all participated. Led by Chairman Chiang, after performing the ceremony, he explained the significance of the New Life Movement, saying that the general life of Chinese people can be summed up as romantic, decadent, lazy, and dirty. The New Life Movement is not a new invention, but inherits the virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame left by our ancestors, to make a modern person a good citizen. The so-called militarization of life is not a special thing, but to make life simple, orderly, uniform, disciplined, time-saving, and practical. This is the purpose of the New Life Movement. Last night, I saw the lantern parade. No matter who, whether in coarse clothes or fine clothes, the buttons were all buttoned up. This is the result of the New Life Movement since its launch. Buttoning buttons is a small thing that everyone can do. If all the people in the country are like this, it will shock foreigners. Therefore, to promote something, start with small, easy, and shallow things. Once guided, it can be done naturally without compulsion. I hope that all provincial civil and military officials, in governing politics, military affairs, education, and civil affairs, will act accordingly. (Central News Agency, 19th)</p>

<p>(Kaifeng) Kaifeng held an expanded memorial week at the People's Hall at 9:00 AM on the 19th to promote the New Life Movement. Five or six thousand people from various agencies and mass organizations attended. Chairman Liu Zhi reported that new citizens should have a new life, and the Chinese people in the past had some bad habits, which led to the decline and weakness of the national spirit. If we want to build and save the country, we must get rid of the old and bring forth the new in daily life, starting with concrete events and practical actions. The civil servants in Henan Province have long had some regular habits, such as morning assembly, morning exercises, lectures, and wearing uniforms. This is the same as the Dawn Movement. We should expand and enlarge the spirit and habits of the Dawn Movement to promote the New Life Movement with a good foundation. It is easier to achieve results than in other provinces. I hope that everyone's life, starting from today, will be more disciplined, rational, and thrifty. Change your perspective and create a new life and build a new China from the New Life Movement. After Liu Zhi's report, Xiao Sa, Zhang Jingyu, and others successively gave speeches, and the audience applauded thunderously, and the atmosphere was very tense. The meeting ended with slogans at noon. (Central News Agency, 19th)</p>

<p>Chen Ce Discusses Naval Defense Opinions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Chen Ce and Liu Weichi went to Jiangxi last week to visit Chiang. They returned to Nanjing on the Jianghua boat on the morning of the 19th. Liu said that during his visit to Jiangxi, Chiang asked about some issues in the Southwest, and everything in the Southwest is now in line with the Central Government. Chiang and others expressed their pleasure at the unity and solidarity. He had not heard of the establishment of a military branch in the Southwest. The Central Government and Chiang are hoping that Hu Hanmin will come, but it is not yet known whether Hu will be able to come to Nanjing immediately. The Jiangxi bandits are now completely surrounded, and it is expected that they will be wiped out by June of this year. Chen Ce said that his visit to Jiangxi was to visit Chiang and report on his overseas observations of the navies of various countries. Because Chiang was busy with military affairs, he made a written report at Yu's suggestion, detailing his observations and contributing his personal opinions on naval defense for reference. Our country has many open ports and many coastlines. In my opinion, when our financial resources are insufficient, we should start with self-defense, at least to be able to block all ports in an emergency. However, blocking tools, such as torpedo boats and cruisers, are also easier to do in terms of financial resources. At the same time, naval training institutions should be added to various ports or fortresses to cultivate naval talents and increase people's knowledge of naval affairs. I plan to inspect the situation in the East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and South China Sea in three months. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Zhu Jiahua: New Life and Education</p>
<p>Ju Zheng: Use Heavy Penalties in Times of Disorder, and Give the Benefit of the Doubt to the Innocent</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held Premier Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 19th. Central Committee member Ye Chucang and more than a thousand staff members attended. Zhu Jiahua chaired the meeting and reported on the relationship between the New Life Movement, saying that the New Life Movement is a national revival movement that emphasizes propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Everyone should start with themselves and expand it, and pay attention to the new life of the general public in society. However, the issue of education is closely related to this movement. Mr. Chiang saw the danger of the nation and the country and paid special attention to moral cultivation, emphasizing propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. However, the new life of the general public in society is often contrary to this. Many people are romantic, undisciplined, and irresponsible. Officials are corrupt, and students are making troubles. This is all due to the lack of purpose and methods in past education. The Central Committee meetings decided to pay special attention to the determination of the purpose of education, and to revive the nation as the consistent purpose of education. After the September 18th Incident, we paid more attention to the implementation and methods of the purpose of education. At that time, we had rectified the academic atmosphere, rectified the university associations, reorganized the academic system at all levels, and prescribed the curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools to cultivate a good academic atmosphere with ancient history, love of the country, and love of the nation, and to promote compulsory education, save education funds, cultivate education talents, and increase the opportunity for students to study. Although the government has these regulations, it cannot be promoted due to the deep-rooted bad habits in society. It often feels difficult when promoting policies. The New Life Movement is to promote the habit of cultivating a new life for students through great social strength in the efforts of education. (Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week on the morning of the 19th. Ju Zheng, Chen Shuren, Cao Haosen, Deng Jiayan, Chen Qicai, Li Yuanding, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 300 staff members from various ministries, committees, and departments attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and Ju Zheng reported on the topic of "Use Heavy Penalties in Times of Disorder, and Give the Benefit of the Doubt to the Innocent," meaning that our country is now moving towards the rule of law, and compared with advanced countries, there is only a difference in human customs. However, in recent years, due to political influence, social unrest, rural bankruptcy, and people forced by hunger and cold, many have fallen into the clutches of the law. The government has had to adopt a system of heavy penalties in times of disorder. If the law enforcers are not qualified and abuse penalties, the consequences will greatly affect the safety of the country and the rise and fall of the nation. Law enforcers should respect the role of criminal law on the one hand, and still understand the reasons for the crimes and always think of giving the benefit of the doubt to the innocent, so that those who are less guilty will not be wrongly sentenced.

<p>(Nanjing) Because the pilotage rights are controlled by foreigners, which is related to national defense and the shipping industry, the government recently established a Pilotage Management Committee. The members are Total Customs Commissioner Meier He, Maritime Survey and Engineering Director Xi Liman, Staff Headquarters Lin Qi, Navy Department Xu Jixiang, Ministry of Transportation Gao Tingzi, and Shanghai Chamber of Commerce representative Chen Tianming, etc. It is planned to transfer the Chinese and foreign pilotage affairs in China to the committee for reorganization, guidance, and supervision. However, the water trade association of commercial groups from various countries in Shanghai refused to send representatives to participate in this meeting. Since its establishment, the association has held three meetings to discuss the first step to recover the Jiangjiang Company and the Japanese Kanlun organized pilot association organized by foreigners. However, the Jiangjiang Company has a total capital of 2 million yuan, so the results of the discussion still need to prepare funds to implement the recovery. According to the pilot staff of the Jiangjiang Company, there are a total of 32 people, and those who join the service must have more than ten years of captain qualifications, and must pass a strict examination and join the share capital of 50,000 yuan before they can serve. Therefore, British and Japanese people account for two-thirds, and only two Chinese people serve in the company, namely Sha Jiangjia and Lin Guojie.

<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>London Gold Price: Today (March 19th), the London gold price remains at 136 shillings and 6 pence, the same as Saturday's price.</p>
<p>London Silver: Today (March 19th), the London silver price for spot is 19 pence 875, and futures are 19 pence 9375, both down by 375.

<h3 id="e92">A Private Conference on British-Japanese Trade (London Correspondence) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>British and Japanese Commercial Views Differ</p>
<p>Focus of Competition is on the Market</p>
<p>Both Export Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Conflict is to Seize Actual Benefits</p>
<p>Britain was originally a country that relied on interest income and occupied a dominant position in finance. Therefore, despite the fact that Britain's visible trade imports exceeded exports year after year, and despite the fact that its industrial organization was not as novel as Germany's or as acute as America's, it could still maintain its old style and gentlemanly attitude because its overseas investments were enough to control its national destiny and could control the world economy. However, since the European War, America has not only caught up with her, but also has a tendency to surpass her. Especially after the global economic panic occurred in 1939, most debtor countries gradually lost their creditworthiness. European countries such as Germany and Austria were almost bankrupt. South American countries such as Brazil and Argentina had to postpone the repayment of foreign investment interest, and new investments were naturally impossible to make. Moreover, the colonies and dominions were all caught in the global economic panic, and they had a tendency to seek their own liberation. Therefore, Britain's invisible trade imports declined very sharply. This had a great impact on the British national economy.</p>
<p>Britain, which previously did not rely much on the export of manufactured goods to fill the balance of international payments, now also painfully felt the necessity. Moreover, she still needs to import food and raw materials, which are indispensable for daily life and industrial operations. If Britain does not pay attention to the export problem, the future of the national economy will be somewhat dangerous. Therefore, since the Ottawa Imperial Economic Conference of the year before last, an economic alliance within the British Empire has gradually formed, with extremely strong protectionist trade colors. This action is of course important to the general economic relations of the world, but its impact on Japan is particularly serious, because although Britain is known as an industrially advanced country, the status of its heavy industry is not as important as that of cotton cloth. Japan, this newly emerging industrial country, also takes cotton yarn and cotton cloth as its second largest export. Not only has it become the hegemon of the west coast of the Pacific in the Far East market, but also British-controlled markets such as British India, Malaya, and Egypt have been invaded by Japanese cotton products and rayon products. Not only are they invading, but they are also surpassing Britain. Britain's textile products are in danger of being driven out by Japanese products. Therefore, last year's Indo-Japanese conference did not conclude until the end of the year.</p>
<p>However, the factors of struggle between Britain and Japan have not been eliminated, and there is still a tendency to continue to deteriorate. If it is really allowed to brew naturally like this, then the British measures to boycott Japan that were issued last year in India, Egypt, South Africa, Malaya, Australia, and other places will become even more severe, and the British-Japanese relations will further deteriorate. However, we know that Britain is good at observing the international situation and using diplomatic means to consolidate its own interests. She knows that it is not necessary to break with Japan at this time, and there is no need to break with Japan, so she still adopts her diplomatic methods to consult with Japan.</p>
<p>It is more appropriate to first have a meeting of representatives from the private textile industry to discuss more concrete solutions. Therefore, the representatives of the British and Japanese private trade conference held their first meeting at the British Board of Trade on February 14. The British representatives were Barrow, Mills, Gray, Cleria, Reese, and Tomson, five people. The representatives of the rayon industry were William and Spielman, two people. In addition, there was also the economic consultant Hughes, the secretary Street, Enzler, and the Board of Trade sent the Director-General of Commerce Lansiman and the Director of Overseas Trade Colville to attend. There were a total of twelve people attending from the British side. The Japanese representatives were Okada, Miyake, Mimura, Kawaguchi, and Tamagaki, five people from the cotton industry, and Shimada from the rayon industry, a total of six people attending.</p>
<p>Of course, it is difficult to predict what the outcome of the future meetings will be, but both sides have their own prejudices. On the British side: (1) The export of cotton cloth and rayon products should be based on the levels before 1931; (2) The agreement on exports to the market should focus on the proportion of exports in the whole world; (3) The sharp increase in the export of Japanese textile products in recent years should take into account the world situation and be slightly restricted. On the Japanese side: (1) The agreed export quantity should be based on 1933; (2) Britain itself and the British dominions and colonies should negotiate separately outside the market agreement; (3) The markets of third countries other than Britain and Japan must also be negotiated outside the agreement.</p>
<p>It is easy to imagine whether such a situation of each holding their own opinions can proceed smoothly. (February 12, 1934)</p>

<p>And actively building roads in eastern Chahar</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan Comes to Beiping to Discuss Defense Matters</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Military Affairs Committee member Xiao Zhenying, upon receiving an invitation from Song Zheyuan to meet in Beiping, arrived in Beiping at 3:30 PM on the 16th via the Ping绥 Railway from Zhangjiakou. According to Xiao's account of the situation in eastern Chahar, "The Japanese army in Dolon recently announced a rotation of the 7th and 8th Divisions, and a portion of the Japanese army, under the pretext of increasing the number of districts in Guyuan (沽源) and Chicheng (赤城), has not yet withdrawn. They are also actively building roads, and Japanese aircraft in Dolon are conducting reconnaissance flights daily, transporting ammunition and supplies, engaging in very active military preparations. Therefore, a concrete plan must be devised regarding the defense of eastern Chahar. Some time ago, two company commanders from a certain regiment under Zhang Renjie's (張人傑) temporarily organized 2nd Division in the Guyuan and Chicheng area plotted wrongdoing, but were discovered by the regiment commander and placed under custody. That unit has been transferred to Zhangbei (張北) for reorganization, beginning the relocation on the 16th. The defense of the Guyuan and Chicheng area will be taken over by Zhang Zizhong's (張自忠) 38th Division. Zhang Renjie is currently still in Zhangjiakou. I have come to Beiping to meet with Chairman Song upon his invitation, and to report on the situation in eastern Chahar to Chairman He. Chairman Song is scheduled to arrive in Beiping from Tianjin on the 17th or 18th. Director Qin (Dechun) (德純) will also come to Beiping if necessary after Song arrives. The Japanese 7th Division plans to establish a command headquarters in Dolon. Dolon is within the provincial borders of Chahar, so we should pay close attention to this." Moreover, Zhang Yunrong (張允榮), the Chahar-Gukou (赤沽) garrison commander, came to Beiping some time ago to handle official business. Recently, due to the tense defense situation in eastern Chahar, he specifically departed Beiping at noon on the 16th for Zhangjiakou, before heading to the Dushikou (獨石口) defense area. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Righteous Army's Battle in Sanxing <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The National Spirit Does Not Die</p>
<p>The Struggle is Exceptionally Fierce</p>
<p>Colonel Iizuka Dies in Battle</p>
<p>Two Hundred Japanese Soldiers Annihilated</p>
<p>The puppet regime receives orders to take the stage. Under the heavy oppression, the people of the Northeast dare not speak out, swallowing their tears. The masses lack strong organization and are in the midst of a transition from agriculture to industry. Those with the strength and determination to resist are ultimately a minority. Among these minorities, some inevitably indulge in the volunteer army movement of national struggle for their personal gain. As a result, irregular behavior has occurred, arousing the resentment of the general public, and some have even become indignant and joined the enemy. Now that the enemy's foundation has gradually stabilized, the lies previously told are being broken one by one. The so-called "Kingly Way Paradise" has truly become a "Deadly Way Black Land." Some of the people of the Northeast naturally still cling to the present, guarding their meager properties, hoping to eke out a living. However, it is gradually becoming impossible to survive. The burden of taxes is almost twice as heavy as before, and agricultural products still cannot be sold. For example, a tax of one yuan must be paid annually for every ten chickens raised. Opium smokers trade everywhere, and the people's lifeblood is invisibly drawn away. Therefore, those who resist are becoming more determined, and the power of struggle is becoming stronger.</p>
<p>The Songhua River valley is the most fertile part of the undeveloped virgin land in the Northeast. The area has convenient water transport, with boats in summer and "Bali" (sledges) in winter. Now, automobiles are also operating. The cultivation of rice paddies is no less than that in the rice-producing areas of the South, and after years of hard work by our fellow countrymen, almost all of it has been developed. Since the Japanese invaded the Northeast, the first stage was focused on seizing political power and expanding their military deployment. The second stage was to use their massive military force to suppress the armed resistance movement of the Northeastern people, while at the same time directing the puppet regime to take the stage. Their major difficulty is the inability to realize their immigration plan, because the people of the Northeast eat sorghum rice, while the Japanese must eat white rice, and there are very few places in the Northeast that produce rice. Therefore, after much consideration and selection, the Japanese found Jiamusi, east of Sanxing, as their immigration area in northern Manchuria. There, water can be used for irrigation, and modern transportation is available for their use. As a result, the Japanese had three immigrations before this year, all of whom were prepared with full arms. In total, there were about 1,400 to 1,500 people, but 300 to 400 of them could not adapt to the northern climate and fled back. When these people arrived in Jiamusi, they began to enclose land. Chinese and Koreans within their areas were ordered to move away. Some were given meager compensation, while others had to swallow their tears and avoid them. As a result, the general public in the area harbors deep resentment towards the Japanese.</p>
<p>The Righteous Army was originally in a latent stage, but was forced to take action by the current situation. Therefore, a small group gathered east of Sanxing, planning to attack Sanxing on one side and Jiamusi on the other, hoping to obtain some weapons and equipment and then enter Hulin to live in the mountains, taking the opportunity to fight the Japanese again. Unexpectedly, Iizuka Tomoyoshi (飯塚朝吉), the commander of the 63rd Infantry Regiment of the 33rd Brigade of the 10th Division stationed in Sanxing, detected this. He dispatched a battalion of puppet troops, flanking left and right. Iizuka himself led a company of Japanese troops, heading down the central road, to attack Shilong Mountain—the gathering place of the Righteous Army—preparing to launch an attack from there on Sanxing, the base of the Righteous Army. The Righteous Army had just finished preparing, planning to depart on the afternoon of March 10 and launch a dawn attack on the 11th. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army arrived early on the morning of the 10th, just as the Righteous Army was fully prepared, launching a surprise attack. The puppet troops were only fighting as a formality. The Japanese encountered this tough opponent, and after three hours of fierce fighting, an entire company of Japanese troops was annihilated. Colonel Iizuka Tomoyoshi was killed, and company commander Suzuki Minoru (鈴木實) naturally could not survive either. Almost none of the remaining Japanese soldiers escaped with their lives. The Righteous Army's responding force was indeed small, but the fighting was very fierce, and the victory was rare since the beginning of the war of resistance. (March 12, Harbin)</p>

<h3 id="e96">Japanese Forcefully Seize Gold Mines in Xinglong County <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The gold mine and river area covers more than 300 hectares</p>
<p>The original mine owner urges the Foreign Ministry to protest to the Japanese side</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since last year, the counties near the Great Wall have been under Japanese pressure, and our political power has lost its operational efficiency. Among them, Xinglong County, most of which is outside the Great Wall, and Malanyu, where the Qing Tombs are located, are where most of the puppet Jehol army is stationed. A large Japanese army unit is also stationed there, and everything is subject to Japanese interference. The county magistrate has no power to implement policies or issue orders. Now, the county government has withdrawn from outside the Great Wall to Malanyu, effectively abandoning four-fifths of the county's land outside the Great Wall to the puppet state. This matter concerns the entire North China issue, so we cannot simply blame the county magistrate for incompetence. It is regrettable that the county is the most abundant gold-producing area in Hebei Province, and more than 20 gold mine licenses have been issued by the Hebei Industry Department over the years. Among them, the area of the Dadong-Xiaodaoliushui (大小倒流水) area outside the Great Wall, covering 200 hectares, and the area of the river gold area near Malanyu, covering 100 hectares, are the largest mining areas. These two mining fields, Dadong-Xiaodaoliushui, are licensed and mined by the Jibei Company, while the Malanyu river gold is mined by Zhang and Xing. Gold production has always been very high. In November last year, Japanese people, accompanied by traitors, went to survey the area. Less than a month later, dozens of workers were dispatched to work. The Jibei Company and the Malanyu Xing-Zhang mine owners fled to the interior during the war, so they did not know that they were being mined by the Japanese and puppet personnel. It was not until the end of last year that they learned the truth and the Jibei Company joined forces with other mining rights holders to submit a report to the Hebei Industry Department, requesting the Foreign Ministry to protest to the Japanese side. After one or two months, nothing happened. Recently, Xing and Zhang, the owners of the Malanyu mining field, came to the province to appeal to the Industry Department, saying that Japanese ronin have recently gathered hundreds of workers to squeeze into the Dadong-Xiaodaoliushui and Malanyu mining fields, expanding their work, and there is a plan to organize a gold mining stock company. The local county magistrate, under the protection of the Japanese army, does not dare to express opposition, so he lets the Japanese and traitors carry out the mining. After receiving the two mine owners' appeals, the Industry Department immediately submitted them to the provincial government, which in turn consulted with the Foreign Ministry to handle the matter of the occupation of the Dadong-Xiaodaoliushui mining field by the Jibei Company. Xing and Zhang have not yet left Tianjin while waiting for the results. According to the two, there are dozens of serpentine mines, pyrite mines, fossil mines, and granite mines along the Great Wall. Previously, people had obtained mining rights with licenses, but now, due to the Japanese army stationed in our territory, all the mines have stopped working. The Japanese, guided by traitors, have come to various mines to investigate, with ambitious intentions. If the negotiations over the Dadong-Xiaodaoliushui and Malanyu mines are fruitless, then other mines will also be successively occupied by the Japanese for large-scale investment. According to reports, after the puppet emperor's proclamation of usurpation, he is scheduled to visit Malanyu on April 5 to perform ancestral rites and sweep the tombs. Minister Shen Ruilin of his puppet Palace Affairs Department will be dispatched to Malanyu in advance to arrange everything. The traitors believe this to be an unparalleled opportunity, and as a result, they have been actively active recently. The county magistrate and local officials are all under the instruction of the Japanese army to prepare for the welcome. (17th)</p>

<p>Robbery case at Zhangze has leads on the bandits. The county water patrol team previously dispatched patrol boats No. 3 and 4 to the Hougang area, where they apprehended bandits Cai Busheng and suspect Wu Sanlao. They were taken back to the team headquarters, where Team Leader Shen held a preliminary hearing. According to Cai Busheng, he is 35 years old, from Caijiadai, Tu 22, Jinshan. He used to trade pigs and rice. He knew Song Gengsheng and Zhang Ziming, who were previously captured. On the eighth day of the twelfth month of last year, he robbed a family of unknown surname in the north of Tinglin, pried open the back door, entered the house, and tied up the victim. However, the binding was too loose, and the victim escaped, sounding the alarm outside. They only stole 16 yuan and three bags of clothes, which were distributed at Wu Ayou's house. He recalled that at the end of November, ten people robbed two families north of Zhangze, carrying two sharp knives and an axe. They entered through the back door, burned the victim's beard with candles, and stole five bags of clothes and more than 400 yuan, which are still being distributed at Wu Ayou's house. In the twelfth month of last year, a family surnamed Zhang in Zhangze was also robbed. He did not know about other cases. Suspect Wu Sanlao confessed that he is 52 years old, living in Jiangbeidai, Tu 22, Jin County, and makes a living by farming. Alai and his adopted son do not engage in proper work. He knows Wu Ayou's mother intimately. One night at the end of November, he went to Ayou's house and saw many people outside, all of whom were robbers. He was not involved in any of it.</p>

<p>Truth of the Hengjing Murder Case Comes to Light</p>
<p>Zhang Heshang, a villager from Mujicun, Hengjing, died suddenly after being beaten by his neighbor Xu Shuiquan. After Wu Xu, the deceased's sister, and others reported the case to the police, accusing Zhang's death of being caused by Xu Shuiquan's crushing of his testicles, Xu was arrested and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning (19th) at 8:00 AM, Prosecutor Shen Bingrong, accompanied by clerk Zhu and coroner Mao, took a steamboat to the village for an examination. It was determined that the deceased's scrotum was ruptured, leading to his death. Many injuries were also found on his head and other parts of his body. It was also found that the deceased's residence and Xu Shuiquan's house were connected. The two houses were only separated by a layer of reed mats, with no walls. There was also a small door next to the reed mats, allowing the perpetrator to freely enter the room to commit the crime. After the examination, they returned to the city at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>Shen Huaiqing, from Xiaoyin Township, District 10, is from a relatively well-off family. He was robbed once before, but because the loss was not significant, he did not report the case. Unexpectedly, at the third watch the night before, more than a dozen bandits came again, speaking in local dialects, holding shotguns and wooden sticks, etc., swarming in. They pointed the guns at Shen's chest, frightening him into silence, while overturning boxes and cabinets, searching at will. They were soon heard by the neighbors, who rang the alarm. The bandits then fired shots to demonstrate, fleeing to the northeast. After taking stock, the loss was about 300 yuan in silver, jewelry, cloth, etc.</p>

<p>The Xili Line had four shipping companies, namely Zhonghua, Zhaoshang, Yonggu, and Xinshang, which operated daily and were quite convenient. Since the opening of the Xiyi Provincial Highway, long-distance buses of the Jiangnan Automobile Company have been shuttling back and forth, making transportation even more convenient. Moreover, the prices are low and the journeys are fast, which has greatly affected the business of the shipping companies and there are fears of an impending crisis. In order to maintain business and for future development, the Zhonghua Shipping Company has opened a Xihang River route, from Wuxi to Hangzhou in Zhejiang, passing through Xin'an, Wangting, Hushuguan, Suzhou, Wujiang, Beida, Pingwang, Zhenze, Nanxun, Huzhou, Linghu, Quanjiatan, Leidian, Tangqi, and reaching Hangzhou. They have already obtained approval from the ministry, and the construction departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have approved the record. They will be opened soon. Also, after the opening of the Xixuan Provincial Highway, Cao Zhisheng and Ye, industrialists from Shanghai, raised 100,000 yuan to organize the Litong Inland Navigation Company, setting up a transportation office in Xisheng, Gongyun Bridge, Wuxi, specializing in transporting goods from Wuxi, Suzhou, Wujin, Yixing, Liyang, and other ports.

The wedding was scheduled for the 20th of this month in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the night before (the 17th), 20 or 30 bandits suddenly came to Jiang's house, each holding a murder weapon, breaking into the door and carrying out robbery at will. Two gold rings, clothes, gifts, and other items were stolen, resulting in a loss of more than 100 yuan. However, these bandits were all acquaintances from the neighborhood. Because the Jiang family's house was magnificent, it aroused covetousness. Fortunately, Jiang's wife had gone to Shanghai a day earlier, and all the valuables had been taken to Shanghai, so the loss from this robbery was relatively small.</p>

<p>Connection Engineering Begins</p>
<p>The connection between the Hangjiang Railway and the Jinyongwu Highway has been delayed for years. Recently, due to the preparation of the Southeast Transportation Exhibition, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed an order to complete the construction of various highways within a limited time, and to build various scenic spots. The connection project has started on the 18th. From the Jinhua Station of the Hangjiang Road to Zhongshan Anyuan in Jinhua City, it can be completed in three to five days. The City God Temple in the county seat has been completely demolished because the road passes through it. From Sanpailou to Shifodian out of the city via Niujiaojian to the Jinyongwu Road bus station, construction can begin soon. The pontoon bridge over the river will be rebuilt into a steel and concrete bridge because it is not suitable. Beishan, Jinhua, is a famous scenic spot in eastern Zhejiang. In order to facilitate the reception of Chinese and foreign guests at the Southeast Exhibition, it has been ordered repeatedly by the province to build a highway from Jinhua Station to Beishan. The route has now been re-surveyed and the construction date has been set.</p>

<p>Kong Xiangrong Reports to Shanghai by Telegram</p>
<p>Since Kong Xiangrong took over as the director of the Gongzhen Team of the National Government's Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, he first went to the upstream and downstream of the construction area to collect a large number of ships and vehicles to transport stone materials. In addition, because transportation by large vehicles could not meet the needs, he negotiated with the Jinpu and Longhai Railways to add extra shifts and increase transportation capacity. He also purchased a large amount of steel cables and lead wires in Shanghai and brought them to the construction site. After two or three weeks of material concentration, he personally went to the construction site to supervise the staff and workers to rush to block the breach day and night. Finally, the breach was closed on the 17th of this month. The following is a copy of Director Kong's telegram to the Gongzhen Team in Shanghai: Zhu Shifu, Secretary of the Gongzhen Team, regards, after the human and material resources were concentrated here for the breach blocking project, the general mobilization order was issued, and I personally directed and supervised the rush blocking on the east and west dikes. In the face of the rapid flow, the opportunity was seized to advance swiftly, and willows were sunk and stones were thrown. The breach was closed at 5:00 PM yesterday. The situation is now stable. Details have been reported separately to the chairman and the general office. All members of the team are serving at the construction site and are working very hard. Congratulations. Notify them specially, Director Kong Xiangrong, Qiao.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Mr. Hunt Discusses American Silver Policy <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Increasing Difficulties for China</p>
<p>The "Great American Evening Post" reports that Mr. Hunt, who served as the Chief Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1918 to 1932, is currently traveling around the world. He recently visited Shanghai and spoke with leaders of the Chinese business and financial community about American silver legislation. He stated that proponents of this legislation believe that its result will greatly increase China's purchasing power. This is a big mistake. In fact, this move will not only fail to benefit the Chinese people, but will increase their difficulties. Therefore, the Chinese government should urgently find ways to suppress silver prices in the Chinese market. China's foreign trade has always been in a deficit position, with last year's deficit reaching more than 700 million. Therefore, China must suppress silver prices in order to become a country with a trade surplus, or at least ensure that exports are balanced with the annually increasing imports. If Washington does pass the silver legislation, then the Chinese government should immediately work to maintain its financial structure. There are three ways to do this: prohibiting silver exports, imposing heavy silver export taxes, or implementing the gold standard. He believes that President Roosevelt, after studying the international silver situation, will be able to reject the Congress's recommendation, and that after further consideration, Congress will not pass this bill.</p>

<p>The Rear Cargo Hold Burns for Two and a Half Hours</p>
<p>More Than 500 Pieces of Cotton Yarn Destroyed</p>
<p>The Sanbei Shipping Company in Shanghai received a telegram yesterday from its Hankou branch, stating that the Xing Shi steamer caught fire in the rear cargo hold at 12:30 AM, and was extinguished after three hours. A second telegram stated that after 12:30 AM, a fire was discovered in the rear cabin, and was extinguished after two hours. The cargo in the rear cabin, including cotton yarn, glass, and steel, was damaged, but the ship's hull was unharmed. After these two telegrams arrived in Shanghai, a third telegram was received, reporting that among the burned cargo in the rear cabin, there were 500 pieces of cotton yarn, half of which were burned, and the unburned ones were mostly waterlogged. The glass and hardware were also damaged, resulting in a huge loss. The details are explored and recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Not Yet Unloaded Upon Arrival in Hankou <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Xing Shi steamer departed from Shanghai on the 14th of this month, loaded with a large batch of goods bound for Hankou. It stopped at Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, and other places along the way, where some goods were unloaded. When the ship arrived in Hankou on the 18th, it docked at the company's wharf. According to the usual practice, the hatches should have been opened for unloading that day, but because it was Sunday, the Jianghan Customs was closed, so unloading was postponed to yesterday, Monday. The steamer was scheduled to set sail from Hankou this morning to return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Fire Breaks Out in the Cabin at Midnight <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The dockworkers left because the ship was rescheduled to open the hatches on the 19th. Unexpectedly, at midnight that night, at 12:50 AM on the 19th, smoke suddenly billowed from the rear cabin of the ship. Most of the crew members were already asleep. When the watchman on the ship discovered the fire and urgently reported it to the captain, the flames had already emerged from the cabin. Upon receiving the news, the captain immediately gathered all the ship's workers, and first used the ship's firefighting equipment to fight the fire. Fortunately, the ship was docked at the wharf and there were many people available to help fight the fire.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Many Passengers and Goods Burned <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Xing Shi steamer this time loaded Shanghai goods, mostly cotton yarn, piece goods, hardware, cigarettes, and glass. The rear cabin contained steel at the bottom, glass in the middle, and cotton yarn piece goods on top. Once the fire broke out, it immediately spread to the yarn cloth. Although the steel and glass were not burned, they were damaged significantly. Fortunately, each cabin had iron bulkheads, preventing the fire from spreading to the middle cabin. It was not until two hours later that the flames were extinguished. After flooding the cabin with water, the fire was completely extinguished. The Shanghai office has telegraphed the ship's captain to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Shanghai Telephone Company Gradually Laying Off Employees <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>More Than 40 People Laid Off in February</p>
<p>Workers Feel the Pain of Unemployment</p>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Shanghai Telephone Company, after purchasing all the assets of the China and Foreign Telephone Company on August 5, 1930, and converting to automatic telephones, has completed the conversion in less than 20 months. At that time, due to the high demand for employees, it temporarily recruited hundreds of people from various sources to speed up the process. Now that the conversion is complete, there is very little need for these employees. Since the end of January this year, it has gradually laid off employees, with more than 40 people being laid off in February alone. These employees, who have received specialized training, feel the pain of unemployment once they are laid off.</p>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reporter specifically visited Mr. Perry, the British Director of the Business Department of the company, to inquire about the details. According to him, the employees being laid off were those who were temporarily recruited during the conversion to automatic telephones. Now that the company's need for labor has decreased, it has no choice but to gradually lay them off in order to reduce expenses. However, the laid-off employees are still given lifetime pensions or additional preferential wages for several months to show compassion. Mr. Perry also stated that the Shanghai Telephone Company belongs to the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, which has more than 90 companies around the world specializing in electrical communications, and has an international character. The Shanghai Telephone Company is now one part of it. When the company implemented the great project of converting to automatic telephone exchanges, it recruited specialized personnel and other employees from all over the world, in large numbers. Now that the project has been completed, most of them have been sent back to various parts of the world, not just a portion of local employees being laid off.</p>

<p>Personnel Have Already Departed</p>
<p>The Guangcheng Dike in Huaining, Anhui Province, has been silted up for many years and has repeatedly suffered from floods. The people are poor and resources are exhausted, with more than ten thousand people facing starvation and unable to survive. The Chinese and Western directors of the Congren Bureau in Anqing and the members of the Dike Works Committee have repeatedly appealed to the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society on Renji Road in Shanghai, and have sent representatives to explain the situation in person. Now that the water has receded, urgent repairs are needed, otherwise there will be no relief, and the more than ten thousand survivors, the young and strong will become bandits, and the old and weak will fill the ditches. Their words were very urgent. However, the entire project requires a huge amount of money. The society, facing limited donations and financial difficulties, had to find a way to help in the most impossible of situations. They勉爲擔任undertook a portion of the dike, repairing the north and south gates. The project will be overseen by Bishop Han of the Wuhu branch, and the supervision of all matters will be undertaken by Mr. Zheng Shouchang, a special commissioner dispatched by the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society.

<p>Caring Only for Personal Gain</p>
<p>Blocking the Transportation of Domestic Goods to Sichuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical Domestic Goods Factory Federation, according to a letter from the Preparatory Office of the Chongqing Su Goods Guild in Shanghai, states that "Our guild has always been responsible for purchasing Chinese and foreign miscellaneous goods in Shanghai and transporting them to Sichuan for sale. In recent years, we have resisted foreign goods and promoted domestic goods. Our guild's patriotism has always been second to none. We have completely switched from selling foreign goods to selling domestic goods. Each year we purchase more than ten million yuan worth of foreign and Chinese miscellaneous goods in Shanghai, selling no less than seven or eight million yuan of sugar porcelain, cotton textiles, silk textiles, wool textiles, rubber products, cosmetics, thermos bottles, umbrellas, toothbrushes, glassware, steel products, bakelite products, toys, lamps, etc., from your members' factories. We have always used the Jiang Tai Gu shipping companies for transportation, and the freight rates have been reasonable, so transportation has been smooth. Unexpectedly, in mid-February this year, the Minsheng, Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, Jiang Tai, Sanbei, and Guangyao companies, without knowing who initiated it, suddenly signed an agreement to form a cooperative alliance similar to a trust, increasing freight rates by 80 to 200-300% compared to last winter. Some rates have even increased six or seven times compared to the old regulations for Chongqing shipping. The extraordinary increase in freight rates is unheard of in Chinese ports and unique in the world. Relying only on the limited vision of one or two ignorant individuals, they arbitrarily divide domestic goods with low costs into grades, stipulate measuring scales, and collect freight rates ranging from 2.5 to 1.25 yuan per cubic foot. The freight rates exceed the cost of the goods or account for 70-80% of the purchase price. Countless goods are transported to Sichuan, where they must be subject to customs duties and local taxes of 20%, exchange rates of 15-16%, and miscellaneous taxes of 2%. Any goods priced at one yuan in Shanghai must be sold for more than two yuan in Sichuan just to break even. At present, the people are impoverished, warlords are rampant, and the communists are causing disturbances. How can the people of Sichuan afford to buy goods at increased prices? If we insist on transporting all the goods with the newly increased freight rates, no one will avoid suffering great losses. Therefore, our members have decided that there is no way to transport domestic goods from your members' factories except to stop transportation. However, manufacturers in various countries hope that we can quickly transport their goods to Sichuan for promotion, so that the economy can be active, and they are also deeply enthusiastic. However, the shipping companies only care about personal profit, ignoring whether or not the promotion of domestic goods is hindered, and stubbornly raise freight rates. This is tantamount to blocking the main sales channels for domestic goods to Sichuan. The annual sales of several million yuan from your members' factories will be cut off, which is no small matter for the future of promoting domestic goods. In addition to attaching a comparative table of the current freight rates increased by various shipping companies, we are writing to you to verify the matter and allow us to transfer it to the Social Affairs Bureau to convene mediation and re-establish appropriate freight rates to facilitate the transportation and promotion of domestic goods. This is truly in the public interest." It is heard that the association, because the matter concerns monopolizing freight rates and hindering domestic goods, has forwarded it to the Social Affairs Bureau to convene mediation.</p>

<p>Pan Zhongjia, the Shanghai County Magistrate and concurrently the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fifth District, considering that the county government has relocated and various undertakings are developing rapidly, and that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway is open to traffic, making Minhang District a transportation hub between east and west, while the original commercially operated (Shanghai-Minhang Long-Distance Bus Company concurrently operated) telephone service has simple equipment and the cable lines are insufficient for the entire county's application, Pan personally came to Shanghai and negotiated with Xu Xueyu, the Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, to transfer the county's telephone service to government operation. Pan also obtained the consent of the Long-Distance Bus Company.</p>
<p>Total Funds: The procedures for transferring the commercial telephone rights to government operation have been decided by both parties in the previous days. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau estimates that the total cost of reconstructing the county's telephone system is approximately 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. Whether the Shanghai Telephone Bureau will fully bear this cost in the future, or whether the county government and local gentry and merchants will raise funds to subsidize half of the cost, is still under negotiation.</p>
<p>Survey Project: The project of reconstructing the telephone pole line between Shanghai and Minhang is being planned by the Engineering Department. It is planned to first install two pairs of total return lines during the initial stage. The telephone pole line will start from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau headquarters at Dananmen, and run straight along Xietu Road through Zhuanqiao to Minhang, and a branch bureau will be established in Minhang. In order to determine the electricity fee project and the total amount of funds, the bureau will send engineers and surveyors to conduct a survey within days. Once the fundraising procedures for both parties are resolved, construction will begin.</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Barbers' Association Petitions the Municipal Party Department <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Barbershop Employees Should Join the Trade Association</p>
<p>Wei Guoyi, the standing member of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Barbers' Trade Association, submitted a document to the Municipal Party Department, stating that "We are submitting this document to present that barbershop employees should join the trade association and report on the situation of Zhang Dafu preventing the meeting from being held, hoping that you will understand our difficulties and approve the establishment on a designated date. In the industry, the distribution of profits between the boss and the employees is mostly based on a four-six split, with daily settlements, and there are no disagreements. This has been a long-standing practice. Moreover, most of the barbershop owners work hard from morning to night, and never express themselves as bosses. And 30-40% of the barbershop employees are shareholders, but they also work the same way and operate together. Since there is no class distinction between the boss and the employees, how can we distinguish between labor and capital? Even if someone is a boss in the morning and an employee in the evening, the situation is special and changes rapidly. It is clear that this cannot be compared with ordinary companies and firms. It is also clear that the boss and the employees cannot take different paths when organizing groups. If the barbershop owners organize a trade association and the barbershop employees organize a labor union, where would those who are both bosses and employees go? If both parties join, it is inevitable that they will both suffer. This may also conflict with the provisions of the Industrial and Commercial Law. For example, in teahouses and bathhouses, there are barbershop chair positions, and there are also bag carriers and porters, etc. In name, they can all be called bosses and employees, but how should they be treated? It is easy to make them hesitate. We ask for separate instructions. In the past, there were groups organized by barbershop owners alone. In 1928, it was called the Business People's Association, and in 1931, it was called the Trade Association. Because the barbershop employees could not participate, it caused great disputes. As a result, both sides were hurt, and it was too late to regret. They were either dissolved informally or ordered to be revoked. In May of last year, the Gao Yatou Tragedy Association was completely cooperated by the boss and the employees, so they were able to achieve the final victory. Therefore, whether the barbershop employees should join the trade association or not, we can learn from the past and present. The advantages and disadvantages are clear, and there is no need to repeat them. Therefore, in the membership list submitted by our association, the term "Director" (i.e., barbershop owner) and "Employee" are clearly indicated as boss and employee cooperation. Now, the barbershop owners and employees in the city urgently need the establishment of a trade association, and they long for it like a drought longs for rain. We are submitting this document to express our sincerity, hoping that you will understand our difficulties and approve the establishment on a designated date. It would be a great kindness. We respectfully submit this to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Department."</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiahe steamer arrived in Shanghai yesterday. A reporter met with the crew members, who told of assisting the rescue of the Hai Shun and discovering a large ship in distress off the Taizhou Islands. A summary of the situation is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e136">Assisting in the Rescue of the Hai Shun <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The British steamer Hai Shun and the Jiahe steamer both departed from Fuzhou. The Hai Shun left four hours earlier. When the Jiahe sailed to the waters off the White Dog Island, the Hai Shun had already run aground on the reef. Because of the fog in the Fujian waters, the Hai Shun sailed outside the Seven Sisters Islands off the White Dog Island to avoid danger. Unexpectedly, the ship was forced by the wind and waves to run aground on the White Dog Island. The passengers were rescued by a small vessel from the Minhai Customs. When the Jiahe arrived, it anchored there to prevent theft. When the Taikoo Ninghai steamer arrived, the Jiahe sailed to Shanghai. The Hai Shun's hull was completely broken and the ship could not be salvaged.</p>

<p>On the 18th, the Jiahe steamer was passing through the waters off the Taizhou Islands. It caught a glimpse of a large ship aground in the bay of Haitan, a place called Dacheng Mountain. Because there are so many reefs in this area, this ship was grounded, perhaps due to fog and misnavigation, or accidentally entered this bay. The ship was very large, with a yellow smokestack. Because the Jiahe was far away, it could not see the ship's name. According to the crew members, it seemed to be flying an American flag. The Jiahe sent a telegram to inquire but received no reply. Later, it saw a Japanese ship anchored outside the ship, providing assistance, so the Jiahe sailed to Shanghai. It is said that this ship is a Japanese ship, but it cannot be proven. It is still aground among the reefs.</p>

<p>This time, the Jiahe steamer carried 328 foreign refugees sent from Xiamen Public Security Bureau to Shanghai, and 177 scattered soldiers, who were transported to Shanghai for dispersal. The Min authorities, with the approval of the China Merchants Bureau, had the Jiahe steamer transport them to Shanghai. Yesterday, when the ship arrived in Shanghai, the bureau had already notified the Public Security Bureau to send police to take care of them.</p>

<p>The Lake Society sent a letter yesterday to the Zhejiang Provincial Party and Government organs, stating, "To the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department and Provincial Government: We have recently received letters from the Shanghai Silk Crepe Association, the Wuxing Silk Weaving Workers' Union, and the Wuxing Textile Industry Association, stating that 'Our members' factories have reported one after another that in recent years, domestic silk fabrics have been hit hard by the dumping of foreign goods, sales have been sluggish, losses have been huge, and they cannot make ends meet. They are unable to resume work this spring. Our associations have requested the government to allocate funds for relief, and are planning to reduce expenses. While we were planning to do so, workers were gathering everywhere, and the situation is serious. It is true that wage reductions are happening all over Suhang, and wages in Huzhou are even higher than elsewhere. The burden is heavy, and it is difficult to sustain. In addition to the Textile Industry Association first requesting the government for relief, each factory is also tightening expenses and reducing wages under the principle of maintaining a sufficient standard of living to resume work as soon as possible in order to maintain the livelihoods of employees. However, there are many workers who understand the overall situation, but there are also many unemployed ruffians who are echoing and inciting them. We are deeply concerned that incidents will occur that will harm public security. We are sending a public letter to request the Zhejiang Provincial Government to provide relief quickly and order the Wuxing County Magistrate and the security team stationed in Huzhou to provide strict protection. We also request the Provincial Party Department to instruct the Wuxing County Party Department to convene worker representatives together with the County Magistrate and various legal groups to earnestly persuade them.' After the letter arrived, it was submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion. Everyone agreed that it concerned local public security and the livelihoods of industry and commerce, and agreed to send a telegram to report it. We are hereby reporting the facts and requesting you to quickly plan relief measures, order the security team stationed in Huzhou and the Wuxing County Magistrate to provide strict protection, and ask the Provincial Party Department to instruct the County Party Department to handle the matter together with the County Magistrate in order to maintain industry and commerce and ensure public security. We await your orders with utmost anticipation." Chen Qicai, Chairman of the Lake Society Committee, bows respectfully.</p>

<p>Stating That Compiling the People's Militia Does Not Harm Farming</p>
<p>The Ningbo Native Association received a reply from the Ning County Public Security Bureau yesterday, which reads: "Dear Sirs, We have received your telegram stating that, according to reports from farmers in Zhouhan Village in southern Ningbo, the Public Security Sub-bureau dispatched police to conscript men after the county compiled the reserve team of the Self-Defense Corps. The villagers did not understand the truth and fled one after another. At this time when spring farming is in full swing, the eagerness may hinder farming. Please order your subordinates to handle the matter properly, etc. After investigation, the compilation of the reserve team is to cultivate the self-defense ability of the people. The provincial order is strict and must be implemented. However, we heard that the conscription standard is only three or four people in each township, which should not have much impact on farming. This matter is supervised by the county government and handled by the district offices. Our bureau's police are only assisting in nature. Regarding the reasons stated in the telegram, in addition to ordering our subordinates to persuade them properly and not to be hasty, we hereby reply for your information."</p>

<h3 id="e146">Twenty-Four Chinese Cigarette Factories Jointly Petition for the Amendment of the Tax System <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Number of Chinese Merchants Decreased From 160 to 40 or 50</p>
<p>Domestic Huanggang and Junzhou Tobacco Leaves are Completely Unsalable</p>
<p>The Chinese cigarette factories, including the Minzhong Cigarette Company, China Huaxing Cigarette Company, Youli Cigarette Factory, Asia Tobacco Company, Yonghe Tobacco Company, Yuxin Cigarette Factory, China Dada Cigarette Factory, Xinmin Cigarette Factory, Jiuyi Cigarette Company, Huamei Tobacco Co., Ltd., Jinshan Cigarette Factory, Huaqing Tobacco Company, Huafu Cigarette Factory, Jinshataiji Tobacco Company, Delong Cigarette Factory, Shanghai Cigarette Company, China Southeast Tobacco Company, Jiangzhe Cigarette Company, Zhongnan Cigarette Factory, Zhuxing Cigarette Factory, Kefu Cigarette Company, Zhonghe Cigarette Company, etc., totaling 24 companies, have jointly submitted a petition stating that the current cigarette tax rate treats Chinese and foreign merchants unfairly. They request a prompt amendment to provide relief. The petition was submitted to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, and the Taxation Department. The petition reads: "Regarding the current cigarette tax rate, which treats Chinese and foreign merchants unfairly, we request a prompt amendment to provide relief. The cigarette unified tax is currently set as a two-tier tax by order of the Ministry of Finance. The first tier is for cigarettes with a selling price of over 300 yuan per case, with a tax of 160 yuan. The second tier is for cigarettes with a selling price of 300 yuan or less per case, with a tax of 80 yuan. The selling price in non-factory locations can be relaxed by 20 yuan, etc. During this period of national construction and bandit suppression, the government is raising funds to build the country, suppress bandits, and secure the people. We, under the leadership of the National Government, dare not refuse to increase the burden for the sake of loving the country and the party. However, the tax rate is inappropriately high or low. We believe that it is unacceptable. The level of taxation is closely related to the prosperity and decline of commerce. If the tax rate is good, the people will not feel the pain even if the tax is heavy. If the tax rate is bad, the people will not be able to make a living even if the tax is light. The distinction between good and bad lies in two points: 1. Whether the burden is equal; 2. Whether it can protect domestic commerce. However, the tax rate set by the Ministry of Finance this time is the opposite of these two principles. This must be reported to our people-loving government. The cigarette unified tax was established in 1929 and has been revised three times in November 1930, February 1931, and March 1932. From July 1929 to November 1930, it was the era of seven-tier tax. From November 1930 to February 1931, it was the era of the old three-tier tax. From February 1931 to March 1932, it was the era of the new three-tier tax. From March 1932 to the present, it has been the era of the two-tier tax. The tax rate has been increasing each time. Before 1912, there was only one British and American company in the cigarette industry. After 1912, Chinese merchants, calling for national goods, emerged one after another, and there is today. Generally, upper and middle-grade cigarettes are mostly made by British and American companies, while Chinese merchants mostly produce lower-grade cigarettes. Upper and middle-grade cigarettes mostly use American tobacco leaves, while lower-grade cigarettes mostly use domestic American tobacco leaves and native leaves. Because of the difference in tax rates and the difference in upper, middle, and lower-grade products, British and American companies and Chinese merchants often occupy opposing positions. If the tax rate is divided into many tiers, the burden on upper, middle, and lower-grade cigarettes will vary according to the quality of the cigarettes, so the burden on lower-grade cigarettes is lighter, and Chinese merchants are in a favorable position, and domestic tobacco leaves are also sold well. If the tax rate is divided into fewer tiers, the burden on upper, middle, and lower-grade cigarettes will not be very different, or even the burden on lower-grade cigarettes will exceed that of upper and middle-grade cigarettes by one or two times, so the burden on upper and middle-grade cigarettes is lighter, British and American companies are in a favorable position, and domestic tobacco leaves are also unsalable. According to past experience, the seven-tier tax is most beneficial to Chinese merchants, followed by the three-tier tax, and the two-tier tax clearly favors British and American companies, and Chinese merchants have no power to resist. Therefore, in the era of the seven-tier tax, there were a total of 150 or 160 Chinese merchants. With the implementation of the two-tier tax, they closed down one after another, and now there are only 40 or 50 left. In recent years, the number of sales has also decreased sharply, and many have suffered losses. At the beginning of the 1932 tax reform, there was opposition because they knew that the treatment was unfair and they were unable to resist. However, the Ministry of Finance insisted on a trial basis and did not approve the revision. After more than a year, the drawbacks have become more apparent. If we separately calculate the sales volume and tax payment of British and American companies and other cigarette companies over the years, it is truly shocking to see the depth of the harm to Chinese merchants and the weight of the preferential treatment to British and American companies. The unified cigarette tax stamps used by British and American companies and other cigarette companies, as well as the tax payments of each cigarette company, are recorded in detail in the Unified Tax Gazette and the Tax Gazette. Now, based on this information, we have separately prepared a comparative table of the unified cigarette tax stamps used by British and American cigarette companies and other cigarette companies in the era of the three-tier tax and the era of the two-tier tax, as well as a comparative table of tax payments. First, let's talk about the use of stamps. According to the unified tax regulations, every 50,000 cigarettes is considered a large case, and one stamp is affixed. Therefore, the number of stamps used is the number of cases of cigarettes sold. In the era of the three-tier tax, the average number for British and American companies was 30,472, and the average number for other companies was 68,422. The sales volume of British and American companies was only 40% of that of other companies, less than 50%. In the era of the two-tier tax, the average number for British and American companies was 48,808, and the average number for other companies was 44,323. The sales volume of British and American companies has exceeded that of other companies by 4,485. Alas, in one year, British and American companies have made such rapid progress, and Chinese merchants have declined so much. People with conscience will be shocked and lose their courage. Next, let's talk about the tax payments. In the era of the three-tier tax, the average amount for British and American cigarette companies was 2,417,403.822 yuan, and the average amount for other cigarette companies was 2,006,252.647 yuan. The burden on British and American companies was 410,000 yuan more than that of Chinese merchants. In the era of the two-tier tax, the average amount for British and American cigarette companies was 2,726,392.522 yuan, and the amount for other cigarette companies was 2,554,466.996 yuan. The burden on British and American companies was only 170,000 yuan more than that of Chinese merchants. Comparing these two tables, in the era of the three-tier tax, although the sales volume of British and American companies was less than 50% of that of Chinese merchants, the monthly tax payment was 410,000 yuan more than that of Chinese merchants, because the quality of the cigarettes was good and the selling price was high, so the tax was also heavy. Now, with the change to the two-tier tax, the sales volume of British and American companies, which was less than 50% of that of Chinese merchants, has increased to more than 100%, and the tax payment has decreased to only 170,000 yuan per month. This is the result of the tax reduction on upper-grade cigarettes and the tax increase on lower-grade cigarettes. Therefore, the burden on British and American companies has been sharply reduced, while the burden on Chinese merchants has doubled. No wonder that in one year, British and American companies have made rapid progress, while the closure of Chinese merchants has accounted for almost two-thirds of the total. The government loves and protects domestic businesses, how can it make such a bad plan? The government may not be clear about the interests. Also, the fifth meeting minutes of the Tax Design Committee, which was recorded in the sixth issue of the first volume of the Tax Gazette in December 1932, stated "This year's tax increase is only 27 percent more than last year's average tax rate, and the sales volume has decreased by more than 20 percent." This shows that the people's burden has increased as a result of the tax increase, and the government has not received corresponding benefits. Because lower-grade cigarettes are heavily taxed, poor people buy and smoke illicit cigarettes. The Tax Design Committee has obtained the answer in the statistics, and it has been published in the meeting minutes and in the gazette. This autumn, Director Xie, representing Minister Song, invited Chinese and foreign cigarette merchants to a meeting and declared that there would be no tax increase within a year. This has been widely heard. The Tax Design Committee is the only agency that designs taxes for the government. The Minister of Finance and the Director of the Taxation Department are the chief officers in charge of the cigarette tax. The ink is still wet, and the words are still echoing, but suddenly there is talk of a tax increase. It is inevitable to contradict themselves and repeat the mistakes of the two-tier tax in 1932. This is even worse, with more tax reduction for upper-grade cigarettes and more tax increase for lower-grade cigarettes. This is more evil than the old two-tier tax and cannot be abolished immediately. Why do we say this? The determination of the tax rate, in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, is always calculated based on the value of hundreds of items. For example, the current tax on alcohol and tobacco is set at 20% of the value. When the cigarette tax was in the seven-tier system, it was approximately 32.5% of the value. The tax rate currently set by the Ministry of Finance, is it close to % of the value? Lower-grade cigarettes, with a selling price of 120 yuan per case, used to have a tax of more than 55 yuan, and the cost was 65 yuan. If the value is 65 yuan, the tax is 55 yuan, which is more than 90% of the value. Now it is changed to 80 yuan, that is, if the value is 65 yuan, the tax is 80 yuan, which is more than 120% of the value. Upper-grade cigarettes above 300 yuan are now also taxed at the second level. Taking the selling price of 300 yuan as an example, after deducting the tax of 80 yuan, the cost is 220 yuan. If the value is 220 yuan, the tax is 80 yuan, which is 36% of the value. For these upper-grade cigarettes with a selling price of 300 yuan, the second-level tax last year was still 95 yuan, that is, if the value is 205 yuan, the tax is 95 yuan, which is still 47% of the value. From this point of view, the result of this year's tax reform is that the lower-grade cigarettes have increased from 90% of the value to more than 120% of the value, and the upper-grade cigarettes have decreased from 47% of the value to 36% of the value. All those who can afford to smoke cigarettes with a selling price of 300 yuan per case are wealthy merchants and have the ability to pay taxes, and the burden should be heavy. Those who smoke cigarettes with a selling price of 120 yuan per case are poor people and lack the ability to pay taxes, and the burden should be light. If the government wants to raise funds, it should choose those who have the ability to pay taxes and impose heavy taxes to increase national income. Now, instead of doing this, it imposes a heavy tax of more than 120% of the value on those who have no ability to pay taxes, and imposes a light tax of only 36% of the value on those who have the ability to pay taxes. The difference in the burden is so great. Why does the government love wealthy merchants and give them a tax reduction when raising funds? Why does it hate poor people and impose heavy taxes on them? If we talk about the Chinese and foreign merchants in the cigarette industry, most of those who make upper-grade cigarettes are British and American companies, and all those who make lower-grade cigarettes are Chinese merchants, as we have said in detail before. If the tax on upper-grade cigarettes is reduced and the tax on lower-grade cigarettes is increased, it is equivalent to reducing the tax on foreign merchants and increasing the tax on Chinese merchants. Chinese merchants' capital and talents are not as good as foreign merchants, and they often fail in business wars. Unfortunately, the tax rate set this time is that the burden on foreign merchants is only 36% of the value, while the burden on Chinese merchants is more than 120% of the value, which is more than three times. This is tantamount to tying the hands and feet of Chinese merchants and waiting for foreign merchants to attack with planes and cannons. How can Chinese merchants not close down one after another in this kind of business war? Political organizations must also love their own people. However, the tax rate is so upside down. The merchants think about this day and night. I don't know why the government loves foreign merchants and gives them the benefit of tax reduction, and hates Chinese merchants and imposes heavy taxes on them. Now, let's discuss this fairly. Does the government want to value the cigarette at %. The current value is 120%, which puts the cigarette industry to death and is unacceptable. But if the government insists on implementing this tax system, the upper and middle-grade cigarettes should have an equal increase to show fairness. For the convenience of calculation, we also use a selling price of 120 yuan for lower-grade cigarettes, divided into three grades: For a selling price of 120 yuan, the tax used to be 55 yuan, and the cost was 65 yuan. Now it is changed to 120 yuan of the value, then the cost is 65 yuan, the tax is 80 yuan, and the selling price should be 145 yuan, which is the third grade. The middle-grade cigarette, calculated as the lower-grade cigarette plus half of the cost, then a selling price of 217 yuan and 50 cents should be set to a tax of 129 yuan, which is a cost of 97 yuan and 50 cents, and a tax of 120 yuan, which is the second grade. The upper-grade cigarette, calculated as the lower-grade cigarette plus the cost, then a selling price of 290 yuan should be set to a tax of 160 yuan, which is a cost of 130 yuan, and a tax of 160 yuan, which is the first grade. (Table omitted) If we follow the above table, the tax rate will be the same for upper, middle, and lower-grade cigarettes, which is more fair. According to the figures, the government's tax revenue can also increase by tens of millions of yuan per year. However, the government is not willing to adopt this because it is concerned that the upper and middle-grade cigarettes do not have the ability to bear the value of 120%, and if it is implemented, all cigarette factories in the country will close down. If the upper and middle-grade cigarettes cannot bear the value of 120%, can the lower-grade cigarettes bear it? The government knows how to protect the upper and middle-grade cigarettes of foreign merchants, but the government does not even think about protecting the lower-grade cigarettes of Chinese merchants and intends to put them to death. Or some may say that the cigarettes above 300 yuan are now taxed at the first level and are taxed at 160 yuan, which is not heavy. But the sales of cigarettes above 300 yuan are extremely rare, and they are allowed to be relaxed by 20 yuan in non-factory locations. In essence, the first-level tax is just a decoration of the tax system, and in fact, only one-level tax is implemented. Cigarettes around 300 yuan are only taxed at 36% of the value. The fortunate foreign merchants have obtained this low tax of 36% of the value, and the sales will inevitably increase, and a lot of money will be bundled and taken away. The unfortunate Chinese merchants bear a heavy tax of 120% of the value, which is more than three times the amount of foreign merchants. How can they compete in the market? The only way is to be defeated one by one and call out under the iron hooves of foreign merchants, and all will perish. Not only that, but the Chinese merchant-produced mid- and low-grade cigarettes, the tobacco leaves used, are either American tobacco leaves produced in Henan, Shandong, and Anhui, or domestic tobacco leaves such as Huanggang, Junzhou, Dengsu, Song, and Xinchang. The annual output of American and local leaves is approximately 150 million pounds, and the average selling price is 20 cents per pound. Farmers' annual income is approximately 30 million yuan. The government's smoked tobacco tax is 4 yuan and 15 cents per 100 catties, and the tax revenue is approximately 4.5 million to 5 million yuan. The remaining domestic tobacco leaves, such as Huanggang and Junzhou, are produced annually at approximately 100 million pounds. The income of the government and farmers is also worth one-third of the American and local leaves. In the era of the seven-tier tax, the tax rate and the value of the cigarettes were the standards for each other, so domestic tobacco leaves were most sold well. When the three-tier tax system was changed, the tax on upper-grade cigarettes was cheap, and the tax on lower-grade cigarettes was expensive. Therefore, the sales of American leaves took away half of the domestic tobacco leaves. Last year, the unified tax was changed to two levels, and lower-grade cigarettes became more difficult to survive. Therefore, domestic tobacco leaves such as Huanggang and Junzhou were completely unsalable. This year, compared with last year, the prices of tobacco leaves such as Xuzhou, Weixian, and Fengyang were high and the prices were low, but there were fewer buyers. This was also affected by the heavy tax on lower-grade cigarettes. The prosperity and decline of lower-grade cigarettes are closely related to the sales of domestic tobacco leaves. If lower-grade cigarettes disappear from the market due to heavy taxes, the sales of domestic tobacco leaves will be cut off. Not only will the government's tobacco tax suffer a great loss, but the rural areas will also go bankrupt. Therefore, heavy taxes on lower-grade cigarettes are tantamount to choking the tax source and directly harming Chinese merchants and indirectly harming tobacco farmers. During this period of rural bankruptcy and rampant red bandits, can the government not consider the millions of tobacco farmers and put them to death for the sake of the fish? All of the above statements are clearly seen and understood by children. We merchants would never have expected such a tax rate to come from our people-loving government. We still request that you change to the seven-tier tax based on the principle of equal burden and protection of Chinese merchants, so that the tax rate is determined by the height of the selling price of upper, middle, and lower-grade cigarettes. At a minimum, you must ensure that the burden is equal, so that Chinese merchants have an equal opportunity to develop their business and are not oppressed by foreign merchants, so that there is a glimmer of hope. At this time of difficult situation, the government needs money everywhere, and the people should increase their burden. What we don't want to see is that the tax on upper-grade cigarettes is reduced, the tax on lower-grade cigarettes is increased, foreign merchants get light taxes, Chinese merchants bear heavy taxes, foreigners laugh and Chinese merchants cry. Minister Kong used to be the Minister of Industry and took care of Chinese merchants in every possible way. This time, he took office as the Minister of Finance. Due to the shortage of military and political expenses, he hurriedly discussed the tax increase, or he did not make a deep consideration, and the original plan stated that it was a trial run, which is enough to see that there are still doubts about this tax rate. We merchants live and eat here and know it deeply. We have true knowledge and insights about the bad tax rate and have statistical figures to rely on. We dare not sit idly by and watch the social economy and our own business perish. Therefore, we dare to state in detail that the Executive Yuan is responsible for leading the administration, the Ministry of Finance and the Taxation Department are the competent authorities, and the Ministry of Industry has the obligation to protect Chinese merchants. They must not sit idly by. I think they will be able to determine the average tax rate based on the heart of justice, so that Chinese merchants are not restrained, and the entire social economy is affected by it. The Legislative Yuan has the power to discuss and decide on the tax rate, and should have a fair proposition. I can't bear to abandon my duties and let the merchants be in distress and without hope. Urgent words, I hope to be adopted. In addition to submitting separately, I hereby submit to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, and the Taxation Department.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Appalling Import of Japanese Agar-Agar <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Recently, 500 Crates Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Agar-agar, also known as "liangcai" or "dongfen," which we use daily in vegetarian dishes, has various other applications besides being a vegetable. In the summer, it's used to make jelly; Western restaurants use it for jellies like banana jelly and rose jelly. Agar-agar is the main ingredient, widely used and sold in huge quantities. Although the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong in our country produce it, the products are poor, and the color is not white, far inferior to Japanese products. Therefore, for decades, the agar-agar we used all came from Japan, one of the Japanese people's specialty products. Since the May Fourth Movement, the boycott of Japanese goods has been enthusiastic, and the import of Japanese agar-agar began to decline slightly. Subsequently, due to the September 18th and January 28th incidents, the import of agar-agar to China declined even further. Japanese agar-agar manufacturers suffered significant losses. Unexpectedly, the patriotic spirit of the Chinese people has weakened, and recently, the boycott movement has gradually been forgotten. Japanese people are taking advantage of the opportunity, and Japanese goods are being imported again in a steady stream. Taking agar-agar as an example, recently, another 500 crates have been transported to China, divided into three batches and transported to Shanghai. Besides the first batch already sold in this city, the remaining two or three batches have also been successively transported to various countries for sale. Although patriotic youths in this city are paying close attention to this matter, unscrupulous merchants are blinded by profit and spare no effort to promote the sale of enemy goods by all means.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Yesterday's Temperature Soared Suddenly <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Highest Reached 81 Degrees</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring in this city, the weather has been cold and warm alternately, resulting in influenza and childhood smallpox almost everywhere. On the 15th of this month, a hurricane suddenly arose in the Beiyang area, making navigation very difficult. The temperature in this city also dropped due to this. On the 17th, it gradually turned mild. The day before yesterday, the sky was clear, and the gentle breeze was pleasant, with a hint of mid-spring weather. Yesterday was even warmer, and the Fahrenheit thermometer rose to 81 degrees, resembling early summer weather. Most of the citizens have changed into cotton-lined clothing, which seems to be very beneficial to the ripening of spring crops in the fields.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Bitter Child Yu A'san Dies of Shame and Refuses Food <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Died from Shame and Refused Food After Being Sodomized by a Patient in the Same Room</p>
<p>A District Party Department Requests the Removal of the Shanghai Hospital Director</p>
<p>The First District Party Department of the Shanghai Special Municipality, because the Shanghai Municipal Public Shanghai Hospital has mishandled the management of patients and disregarded human life, has submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department to forward to the Municipal Government for the removal of the hospital director, Zhou Chuliang. The text of the submission is transcribed as follows: "Submission for forwarding. According to the report from the 37th sub-district, according to the report from citizen Ren Xincai, requesting a thorough investigation of the Nanshi Public Shanghai Hospital for disregarding human life, and forwarding to the superior Party Department for prompt investigation to uphold humanity and quell public outrage. The Nanshi Shanghai Hospital is the only public hospital in this city, with a long history and trusted by the citizens. However, since Zhou Chuliang became the acting director, the management has been poor, the hospital affairs have been neglected, and public opinion is buzzing, which is a hidden worry for the future of the hospital. Recently, a bitter child named Yu A'san was sent to the hospital by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's relief section for treatment. However, he was not suffering from a serious illness, and there was no change after being admitted to the hospital for many days. Suddenly, on the 24th of last month, the hospital suddenly requested the Tongren Fuyuantang to provide a coffin for collection. The cause of death is truly puzzling. However, rumors outside say that the death of the bitter child Yu A'san was not due to incurable illness, but because he was</p>
<p>sodomized in the hospital, and committed suicide out of shame. The hospital director, Zhou Chuliang, did not report the matter to the authorities for investigation, allowing the victim to be wronged and hastily buried, attempting to cover up</p>
<p>the weakness of the hospital's poor management and neglect of human life. Under the bright sky and white sun, in a dignified public hospital, such illegal incidents occurred, and there is such a director who manages poorly and disregards human life. If this is not thoroughly investigated and severely dealt with, how can Yu A'san's grievance be cleared and the stain on the hospital's past history be washed away? The Department has always valued humanity and upheld justice, so it has specifically reported the situation and requested a thorough investigation, and forwarded it to the superior Party Department for prompt investigation to punish negligence and quell public outrage, which would be greatly appreciated." Based on this, it is reasonable to report the situation and request a thorough investigation, and forward it to the Municipal Party Department for investigation. The Department believes that the matter concerns human life and legal principles, so it is not appropriate to remain silent. It has sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation of the points presented by Ren Xincai, which are indeed true. Yu A'san, a native of Tongzhou, 16 years old, was sent to the hospital by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's relief section for diagnosis and treatment on January 24, and stayed in the fourth-class No. 1 ward. The doctors who diagnosed and treated him were Doctors Jin and Jiang. Because the doctors saw A'san tearfully complaining that he had been bullied, but he refused to reveal the truth. On February 18, a tea attendant saw A'san hanging himself in the toilet. He quickly persuaded him and inquired about the details, and he said that he had been sodomized by a patient in the same room (name temporarily kept secret). After reporting to the director, the person fled. A'san was transferred to the third-class ward, and he stopped eating. After two days, he suddenly had abdominal pain and vomiting, gradually became unconscious, and died three days later due to heart failure. Based on this, Yu A'san died of shame and refused food after being sodomized, which is not a false statement. The hospital director, Zhou Chuliang, bearing the important responsibility of hospital director, failed to prevent it beforehand, and only knew how to cover up the stain and hastily bury the body afterward, without reporting the person who committed the act to the authorities for investigation. This is indeed poor management and disregard for human life. It is reasonable to report the situation to your commission for a thorough investigation, and request the Municipal Government to remove the hospital director to punish negligence and value humanity, which would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>
<h3 id="e150">Poisonous Atmosphere Permeates Everywhere <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Besides Red Pills, There Are Also White Pills, Quick, Quick!</p>
<p>Two Principals, Zhou Rongchuan, etc., Are All Arrested</p>
<p>Red Pills</p>
<p>Lu Zhulin and Wang Rusong, detectives of the Second Group of the French Police Department, learned the other day that there was a private organization inside No. 90, Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road, secretly manufacturing poisonous red pills at night, selling them in the market for profit, violating the ban. Therefore, at 12:15 that night, they rushed to the address to search, but no one was manufacturing them. However, they saw a Cantonese woman, Xiao Lin (20 years old), and her younger sister-in-law, Xiao Fengzhen (19 years old), both with frightened expressions on their faces, hiding packages in the attic and stove. The detectives immediately detained the two women and searched them thoroughly. What they had hidden was red pills and manufacturing equipment, including 36,000 red pills seized, packed in several bags, as well as a pill-making rolling board, medicinal materials, a sieve, a seal, bags for holding pills, etc. They were taken to the police station. When questioned, the two women said, "Our family specializes in manufacturing, working at night. The owner is Zhou Rongchuan from Chaozhou, living at No. 1, Shunqing Lane, Bair Road." The detectives went to Shunqing Lane and arrested Zhou. In his room, several bags of sample red pills, about several thousand pills, were found inside a porcelain hollow Maitreya Buddha on the dresser. They were immediately taken to the police station. It was found that Zhou Rongchuan was also known as Zhou Jinhai. In July of the year before last, he was arrested for private possession of drugs, and the court sentenced him to a fine of 300 yuan. Last June, he was arrested again for opening a red pill hall, and the court sentenced him to three months in prison. It is clear that he specializes in running a red pill business. He was taken into custody together. Yesterday, he was also sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Local Court. Yao Zhaodi, the police station's lawyer, explained the case, briefly stating that the police station still needs to conduct a detailed investigation of this case, requesting that the defendants be detained temporarily and the case be investigated in seven days, requesting interrogation. The evidence was presented to the court, and Chief Judge Wang Gangxu reviewed it. After briefly questioning the defendants, they all made excuses and denied the charges. The court ordered that the interrogation be rescheduled to March</p>
<p>28, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<p>White Pills</p>
<p>The anti-narcotics department of the Public Concession Police learned that someone was selling drugs in room 53 of the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road. Hua Detective Song Bingzheng and Detective Chen Yaoting went to arrest a man named Xu Gongchen from Nanjing on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, seizing nine bags of white pills. These pills are also known as "Quick, Quick," because they are more convenient to take than red pills. He was taken back to the police station. Under interrogation, it was learned that its manufacturing facility was located on the third floor of the Dashengchang Butcher Shop at No. 117, Ximen Road, in the French Concession. They immediately joined forces with detectives from the French Police Department and went to arrest a man named Li Zhengxiang from Wuxi, seizing a large number of machines, raw materials, and smoking paraphernalia for manufacturing white pills. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, demanding a heavy sentence. After Judge Feng questioned the two defendants, Xu and Li, he ordered them to be returned to custody and the interrogation to be rescheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Five Bodies Autopsied in One Day <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Most Were Suicides</p>
<p>Only One Person Was Rescued</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, there were as many as five male and female corpses in the autopsy room on Feilun Road, all of whom were suicides, knife wounds, and those crushed to death by cars. Only one body died of illness. After being reported by various police stations to the Procuratorate of the First Special District Local Court, at around 10 o'clock, Prosecutor Guo Wei was commissioned, accompanied by the two medical examiners, Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, to visit the morgue to examine the bodies. The details are recorded as follows: (1) At the Yunnan Road Yangtze Hotel at around 7:00 PM on the 16th of this month, Guo Xiwu (21 years old, formerly worked in a southern goods store) and Xu Kangtai (22 years old, currently working in the Yishengchang Southern Goods Store in Taizi Bay, Zhabei) from Chongming were relatives. Recently, both suffered from economic difficulties and suddenly had the idea of ​​ending their lives. As a result, the two agreed on this day and went to the hostel to book room 705. Later, they swallowed opium to commit suicide. At 8:00 AM the next morning, they were discovered by tea attendant Li Jinqing. The Lao Zha Police Station was notified and detectives were dispatched to investigate. Guo and Xu were immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, Guo died due to severe poisoning, and Xu gradually woke up after being treated by doctors. He is now out of danger and there is no need to worry about his life. (2) At the Da Zhong Hotel at No. 4 Peikai'er Road at around 10:00 AM yesterday, a young man went to book room 7. He wrote his name as Chen Shijin, 19 years old, in the circulation book. He did not know what stimulus he had received, and he suddenly had the idea of ​​ending his life and secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. Later, the tea attendant of the hostel discovered it and rushed to tell the accountant, who notified the Huishan Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate and found an opium box, a bag of white sugar, and a pawn ticket, two small foreign coins, and thirty-five copper coins in the room. Judging from the situation, it was probably due to economic difficulties. After being transported to Tongren Hospital for treatment, it was ineffective and he died soon after. (3) A woman, Yang Wan, 24 years old, registered in Jiangxi, used to work as a maid at a certain Westerner's place at No. 30 Linyi Road in Pudong. Her husband, Yang Dazhong, also worked as a Westerner's servant there. The couple usually got along well. A week ago, Yang was reprimanded for washing clothes too slowly by her master. Her husband also quarreled with her after learning about it. Unexpectedly, on the day before yesterday, Yang was resentful and suddenly had the idea of ​​ending her life and secretly hanged herself in her bedroom. Her husband caught a glimpse of it and immediately tried to untie her, but it was too late. He immediately reported to the Yangshupu Road Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate and transported Yang to Shengxin Hospital. Treatment was ineffective and she died soon after. (4) Shen Liansheng, a native of Nanxun, 32 years old, at around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday</p>
<p>was riding in rickshaw No. 3282 from west to east on Jing'an Temple Road. Unexpectedly, when he arrived at the Great Light Cinema, Ding Jinan, a doctor, was driving his own car No. 2064, speeding from the east. However, the car saw a motorized bicycle driving in front of it, so it turned north to avoid it, but it did not brake, so it collided with the rickshaw. Shen fell out after being hit at that time and was crushed by the car. After Hua Constable No. 872 on duty caught a glimpse of it, he immediately copied down the car number and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate and transported the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment, which was ineffective, and he died soon after. (5) At around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, the General Patrol Police Station received a report from a person named Li Shunchang, who was in</p>
<p>in the empty house at No. 21 Central Road as a servant, saying that an old man had been stabbed to death in the house. He also said that he knew the old man, who had been selling cakes in the area for more than 20 years to make a living. However, he did not know his name. People called him the "Cake Old Man." The old man also had a mistress who lived with him in the house, but the woman's whereabouts are now unknown. The head of the police questioned him and immediately dispatched detectives to investigate, and found the old man, about 60 years old, with several stab wounds on his head, bleeding all over his face, lying on the ground. About a foot away from the body was a sharp knife and a carrying pole. After Prosecutor Guo inspected it, he instructed the family members to sign and collect the body for burial separately.</p>

<p>This year, the Chicago World's Fair will be held again. Dong Kunfan, the Fujian Provincial Commissioner for Collecting Products, felt it was difficult to organize lacquerware to participate in the Second Chicago World's Fair because the financial resources of Fujian Province were exhausted. He had presented his opinions to Minister Kong. It is said that Minister Kong believed that the Fujian lacquerware industry had been famous all over the world and would provide strong support this time to save the declining lacquer industry.</p>
<h3 id="e153">The French Concession Police Solved the Case Quickly <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Burglary at Deng Shaonong's Home Was Solved a Few Hours Later</p>
<p>Eight Thieves Were Arrested and Stolen Goods Were Seized, Detained for Seven Days for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>The home of Deng Shaonong, a Cantonese resident at No. 7, Lane 426, North Henan Road, was suddenly visited by four bandits at 9:30 the day before yesterday. They tricked the door open, rushed in, and threatened them with guns, robbing more than 90 yuan in cash. At that time, the victim had fought with the bandits, and as a result, one of the bandits was injured and captured. Bao Detective Liu Shaotian of the Disui Road Police Station was also hit in the leg by a stray bullet. They were transported to the hospital separately, and the details have been recorded in this newspaper. However, since this case occurred, the French Concession Police in charge immediately ordered the Chinese and Western detectives on duty to work hard to investigate, and announced the solution of the case a few hours later, which can be said to be very fast. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e154">Undercover Investigation <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>After the robbery case occurred on North Henan Road the day before yesterday, Jin Yangwu, a Chinese detective of the French Concession Police, received a report from an informant that a gang of bandits was hiding in the Anle Hotel at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Aierjin Road. He reported to Chinese Detective Captain Shao Jingfan and secretly went to investigate. He learned that the bandits had opened a room in room 20. However, at that time, there was only one bandit in the room, and he was deeply afraid of disturbing the grass and scaring away the other accomplices. Therefore, he did not arrest him immediately, but opened another room in the next room and secretly investigated.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Eight Thieves Arrested <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>At 5:30 PM, the accomplices began to arrive one after another. He then cooperated with Western Detective Captain Hale, Chinese Detectives Liang Yuliang and Cao Xirong, and others to go to room 20 of the Anle Hotel and successively arrested the bandits Chen Shaoqing (i.e., Chen Jiangpei, also known as Chen Changfa), Cai Lianyun, Zhou Miaoji, Jiang Jinfu, Zhou Xiaoxiang, Yuan Liansheng (i.e., Bajiaozi), Xu Buzhan (i.e., Xu Tongtang), and Chen Rongsheng (i.e., Jiuzhitou), all natives of Tongzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Repeated Robberies <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>He seized 130 yuan in cash, a deposit book of the Siming Bank for 500 yuan, a diamond ring, and a pawn ticket, and took them back to the police station together. Under interrogation, it was learned that they were indeed bandits who had committed armed robbery of more than 1,000 yuan of property from a certain surname's home on Xinzha Road and attempted to rob property from Pushan Villa on Beihai Road, as well as the Deng Shaonong family on North Henan Road. It was provided by the arrested bandit Jiang Jinfu that one of the bandits who was injured in the morning, named Xu A'tu, had discussed the matter in room 17 of the Yuansheng Hotel at No. 112 Fujian Road beforehand.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Request for Investigation <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>In addition to going to Yuansheng to investigate and investigating the injured Xu A'tu, the Chinese and Western detectives also summoned the victim Deng Shaonong and the maid Jiang Zhushi to the police station for identification, and ordered that the thieves be taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Jiang Baolian, the police station's lawyer, stood up and described the details of the case, requesting permission to detain the defendants so that the police station could continue the investigation. If it is found that any of the defendants are innocent, the police station will request release early before the deadline.</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Victim Reports <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Then, the victim Deng Shaonong from Guangdong reported that at 9:30 the day before yesterday, I was upstairs when the maid reported that four people were visiting downstairs, who came from Pudong. I went downstairs, but when I reached the half-landing, the four thieves had already arrived, threatening with guns, and forced me upstairs, where one thief guarded me, and the rest searched for a long time. Then, they pushed me downstairs. At that time, I wanted to resist and did not want them to continue searching, so I went upstairs again and took 35 yuan in cash. At this time, two thieves had already slipped away, and another thief took the 35 yuan I was holding and fled.</p>

<p>Only one thief was left holding a gun and guarding me, refusing to leave. I ordered him to leave several times, but he did not answer. I was afraid that he had other plans, and I estimated that I could subdue him, so I disregarded the consequences and took the opportunity to grab him, and started fighting in the alley. The pistol he was holding was knocked to the ground. After ten minutes, in addition to pressing the thief down, I ordered the maid to pick up the pistol on the ground and hand it to me. After I got the pistol, I let go and ordered the thief not to move, but he did not listen and pounced on me desperately. For self-defense, I fired the pistol several times, injuring the thief and knocking him to the ground.</p>

<p>At that time, someone came forward with a gun. I asked him who he was. He answered that he was a Bao Detective. He helped fire a shot. As for who shot the other injured Bao Detective, I don't know. Among the eight thieves arrested, I can only recognize the eighth defendant, Chen Rongsheng. Cao Xianjiao, a tea attendant at Yuansheng Hotel, also reported the case, proving that Xu A'tu and others came to open room 17 on the 16th, and the defendant Chen Rongsheng was also in the room. After Liu Yugui, the judge, interrogated the defendants, who mostly made excuses, he ordered that Chen Shaoqing and the other eight people be detained for seven days for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Complicated and Fragmented Inside Story of the Qinghefang Assassination Case <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Murderer, Chen A'si, Claims the Deceased Framed Him and Sent Him to Prison</p>
<p>And Introduced His Wife to Commit Adultery and Remarry</p>
<p>It has already been reported in this newspaper that on the 15th of this month, at half-past twelve midnight, a Suzhou man named Lu A'san was assassinated at the back gate of No. 602 Qinghefang, Guangdong Road. The case has now been investigated by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, Detective Song Bingzheng, and Investigator Liu Zhaonian of the General Investigation Department of the General Inspectorate. The murderer's name is Chen A'si, also known as Shen A'si, from Yangzhou, currently hiding at No. 7, Lane 38, Rue Laguerre in the French Concession. They immediately led Detectives Zhang Hongyun and Bao Lisheng to the address, arrested Chen, and confiscated six shell casings, taking them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the First Special District Court's First Criminal Division. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the deceased and his wife, Wang A'gui, went to the home of a woman named Chen Lao'er at No. 602 Qinghefang on the 15th. At the time of the incident, when the deceased and his wife went downstairs to urinate at the back gate, the defendant approached and fired several shots before fleeing. Police detectives rushed to the scene, but the defendant had already escaped. However, the deceased was still conscious and identified Chen A'si as the shooter. After the police investigated and learned his address, they arrested him. According to the defendant's confession, the deceased had previously invited him to rob opium at Xinzha Road, but the deceased reported him to the police, leading to his arrest and conviction. The deceased also seduced his wife and married her off to a rogue named Wu Jinbiao in the French Concession. After the defendant was released from prison, he negotiated with the deceased but was suspected of having an affair with Wang A'gui, who wanted to kill the defendant. Therefore, he struck first and killed the deceased. He stated that he had discarded the pistol in the river. Presiding Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered the case to be adjourned for further questioning. Wang A'gui testified that the defendant indeed killed the deceased, but the reason was mainly due to the failure to borrow money and his attempt to have her elope with him, which led to her husband's severe reprimand. When questioned, the defendant Chen A'si admitted to killing Lu A'san but completely denied the two points mentioned by Wang A'gui. He claimed that the deceased not only lured him into theft and then reported him to the police but also introduced his wife to commit adultery. He did not hold a grudge but was falsely accused of having an affair with Wang A'gui and was threatened with death, so he killed him. He stated that he had discarded the pistol in the river. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered the case to be adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e163">A Large Gambling Den Was Cracked Down in Jinglinlu <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>An Italian National Was in Charge</p>
<p>The Poker Game Was Different From Other Gambling Methods</p>
<p>—Eight Men and Women Were Arrested One After Another—</p>
<p>After Deputy Chief Detective Zhu Jihuang of the Hongkou Police Department learned that a person named Boni Asi was running a gambling establishment in the Jinglinlu No. 2 Apartment, he disguised himself as a gambler and entered. He found that the scale was quite large and the stakes were high. He immediately exchanged four marked ten-yuan banknotes from the Bank of Communications for chips and joined the game. The game was poker, but the rules were different from those outside. Before long, he lost all his chips and left. He then reported to the Italian Consulate and obtained a search warrant. At 1:45 AM the day before yesterday, he executed the warrant, arresting the owner, the Italian Boni Asi; a host, the Russian Qin Sbao; a chip changer, the Greek Mike Leisi; a boss, the Russian Funa Zefu; and gamblers, the Russian Tang Gen, the Brazilian Kala Si, La Liushi, and a Cantonese woman Chen Ailian, totaling eight people. Except for Boni, who was handed over to the Italian Consulate, the rest were detained. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented the case, stating that the defendant Kala Si jumped out of the window to escape when the police arrived, causing a foot injury. He is now being treated in the hospital and cannot attend court today. When questioned, the defendants admitted to gambling, but Qin, Mai, and Fu denied helping Boni Asi run the gambling den. Judge Deng Baosun reviewed the confession and ordered the verdict to be announced on the morning of the 21st. Tang Gen was released on bail of one hundred yuan, and the rest were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>According to a message released yesterday by the International Trade Bureau, Chinese porcelain, such as teapots, teacups, bowls, vases, and bronze ware, such as new embossed, purple light pots, purple light sets, yellow pots, and tinware, such as candlesticks, incense burners, and other square pieces, as well as round pieces such as teapots, bottles, plates, Fujian lacquerware, and various antique metal artwork, are very popular among foreigners. Exports are not small every year. In recent years, various export merchants in Shanghai have actively improved their products to cater to foreign psychology in order to develop foreign trade. Recently, the Mexican Manier Cogado Company sent a letter to the International Trade Bureau, intending to purchase various Chinese art products and requesting price information. Manufacturers who wish to trade with Mexico can contact the International Trade Bureau to promote their products. The bureau is located on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs Building on Sanma Road in this port.</p>

<p>The Opening Ceremony Will Be Held on the 22nd</p>
<p>Invitations Are Sent to Various Agencies and Organizations to Attend the Ceremony</p>
<p>The Shanghai North National Products Exhibition on Datong Road, Zhabei, this city, was originally scheduled to open today. However, due to delays in the delivery of goods from factories in other ports, a telegram was sent requesting a postponement. After receiving the telegram, the association decided at a representative meeting to postpone the opening by two days to the 22nd. Yesterday, invitations were widely sent to various agencies and organizations to attend the opening ceremony. A telegram was also sent to Minister Chen Gongbo of the Ministry of Industry, requesting him to attend the ceremony to show solemnity. The original telegram stated: "Respected Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry of the Nanjing National Government, dumping of foreign goods, increasing trade deficit year after year, outflow of money, the foundation of the country is in danger. If we do not try to rescue it urgently, the industry and factories will have the danger of stopping work, and the social economy will also show signs of collapse. The association, in view of this, specially initiated the Shanghai North National Products Exhibition, collecting national products for public display, in order to give the Chinese people an opportunity to recognize national products, so as to arouse their concept of enjoying national products. Now the preparations have been completed, and it is scheduled to open at 2 pm on the 22nd of this month. We respectfully invite you to attend and preside over the opening ceremony to show solemnity and encouragement."</p>

<h3 id="e169">Renewal of Business Licenses for Restaurants in the Urban Area <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>—Extended to the End of March—</p>
<p>The validity period of business licenses for restaurants in this city is limited to one year. According to regulations, they must report to the Municipal Health Bureau for registration and renew their licenses before March 15th of the following year. Failure to do so will result in penalties according to regulations. March 15th of this year has already passed the deadline for license renewal. However, because the Health Bureau relocated to its new building in the Central District of the city before the New Year, some restaurants may not be aware of the Health Bureau's new address. Therefore, while many restaurants have renewed their licenses according to regulations, a few restaurants have not yet reported for renewal. The Municipal Health Bureau, recognizing that there is a legitimate reason for this, has reportedly extended the renewal period to the end of March. Failure to renew the license by the deadline will result in penalties according to regulations, without leniency.</p>

<p>Liu Huiqing, a 33-year-old from Shandong, checked into the Baohe Hotel on Xieqiao Road in Nanshi around 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. After paying the room fee, he closed the door and went to sleep. At 11 a.m. yesterday, the bellboy heard groaning sounds from the room and suspected something was wrong. He pried open the door and saw Liu lying stiffly on the bed with a pale face. He had taken poison. The bellboy reported to the front desk, and Liu was rushed to Renji Hospital. He died despite efforts to save him.</p>
<p>At the Danghu Hotel on Shanxi Road in the Public Concession, a traveler who claimed to be Wu Shunxian, 20 years old, checked into room 22 the night before last. For unknown reasons, Wu Shunxian suddenly had thoughts of death and swallowed raw opium behind people's backs to commit suicide. It was not until around 10 a.m. yesterday that the bellboy discovered him. He reported to the front desk, who then reported to the police. Detective No. 116 was dispatched to investigate. Shunxian was rushed to Renji Hospital, but because he had ingested a large amount of poison, he died before treatment could be administered. He was sent to the coroner's office for examination. According to the reporter's investigation, the deceased's real name was Tang Yuanhong, from Ningbo.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Public Concession Health Conditions for February <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Good Health Conditions Last Month</p>
<p>The Head of the Municipal Council Health Department reports for February: The health conditions within the concession were quite good this month. Smallpox was quite prevalent for several weeks, but the public need not panic excessively if they utilize the Health Department's vaccination facilities. Scarlet fever and influenza were also quite prevalent. Regarding the former, school children should immediately seek medical attention if they feel discomfort in their throat. The latter should also not be neglected, as delays can harm both the individual and society. One case of leprosy was discovered in the prison hospital. The patient was a Cantonese man, 23 years old. It is unknown where he contracted the disease. Measles cases are currently increasing. Five cases of meningitis were discovered, four of whom were Chinese. Typhoid fever has decreased among both Chinese and foreigners. The Health Department administered vaccinations. The motor vehicle team administered 10,971 vaccinations, and the branch offices administered 5,594 vaccinations. Due to the cold weather and the Spring Festival, the public did not pay sufficient attention to this. Regarding vital statistics, the reported birth rate for foreigners this month was 16.07 per thousand. The reported birth rate for Chinese was only nine per ten thousand, likely representing only a small fraction of the total. The mortality rate was 11.8 for foreigners and 14.6 for Chinese, both lower than usual. The total number of Chinese deaths was 1,327, including 651 unclaimed corpses found on the east and west borders. The pathological laboratory performed 1,896 chemical tests, and the chemical laboratory performed 535 analyses. The rabies clinic treated 44 people, five of whom were from outside the city. Thirty-six people were advised to receive treatment, and three people did not complete their treatment. The newly built rabies observation room is now in use and is quite satisfactory. Both the foreign and Chinese isolation hospitals were busy due to smallpox and scarlet fever. Four foreigners and twenty-six Chinese were admitted to the hospital with diphtheria. The Chinese section of the Police Hospital had 1,683 outpatient visits, 151 inpatients, and two deaths. The Indian section was quite quiet. The Walderloo Road Prison Hospital had 835 admissions and 19 deaths, 11 of whom had tuberculosis. The Mental Hospital can accommodate severe cases, but there are still no vacancies for ordinary cases. Milk production has decreased slightly. Samples were subjected to bacterial tests and all passed. However, four samples failed the chemical test at grade B and one at grade A. The illegal sale of milk by unlicensed Indians has been investigated again. The number of slaughtered pigs has decreased due to the Spring Festival, exceeding the record. Other slaughter numbers have decreased. Over 30,000 pounds of substandard meat were disposed of. The output of by-products has increased. The vegetable market business is very prosperous, and inspections and calibration of weights and measures are still carried out on time. Bakeries are often inspected in the early morning due to the limited amount of night work. Food stores have been inspected, and items that do not comply with regulations have been warned or prosecuted separately.</p>
<p>To prevent mosquitoes, many ditches and rivers have been cleaned. Unregistered sheds have been found in the eastern and western districts, and the Public Works Department has been notified to remove them.</p>

<p>The assassination of Tang Jiapeng, manager of the Rongji amusement park at the Great World, last summer, resulted in the arrest of the perpetrators Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi by the French Concession police. A pistol used by Zhao to kill Tang was also retrieved. After investigation and trial by the Second Special District Court, Zhao was sentenced to life imprisonment and Zhang to 20 years imprisonment. Because both convicts appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, the High Court opened a hearing some time ago and announced its conclusion, scheduling a date for sentencing, as reported previously. It has been learned that Presiding Judge Guo Dezhang, after reviewing the entire case file, found that there were still points of doubt in the case that needed to be thoroughly examined in order to avoid wrongful conviction. Therefore, yesterday, he convened a hearing and announced the dismissal of the concluding arguments before the appellants arrived in court, and scheduled a date to reopen the arguments.</p>

<p>New Offering of Domestic Glass Cups The Zhongshan Glass Factory, in view of the fact that ladies and gentlemen in society often suffer from not being able to buy domestic, high-quality, and inexpensive hot water cups, which has led to the market being flooded with foreign goods, has specially hired expert technicians to painstakingly research and produce various kinds of Labor Brand hot water cups. The styles are ingenious and durable. It is said that the cups are guaranteed not to explode at a high temperature of 140 degrees Celsius. If the above situation occurs, you can bring the original cup to Zhongshan Glass Factory at No. 980 Kangqu Road, Dapulu Road, Nanshi, or to the factory's distribution office at No. 419 Mingzhu Street, Fuyou Road, inside the old North Gate, to exchange it for a new cup. Among the various colors, the electro-optic cup is the most exquisite. This cup is not only the best among domestic hot water cups, but also no less excellent than imported products. This is indeed good news in the voice of promoting domestic goods. The factory also manufactures various other glass materials and utensils, and the prices are very cheap.</p>

Now, because of the reorganization auction, the goods are of good quality and low price, which is extraordinary. By 10 a.m., the prices of all goods were truly low and cheap, such as line spring trousers material sold for only one yuan per piece. The total sales for the entire day amounted to more than 17,000 yuan. In this time of social recession, such a grand occasion is truly unprecedented.</p>

<p>Seven Items of Small News and a Public Letter</p>
<p>Compiled by the Reading Guidance Department of the Shen Bao Circulation Library</p>
<p>A Word from Xiaobian: It has been two and a half months since the Shen Bao Circulation Library established the Reading Guidance service. During these two months, our small endeavor has garnered attention from some individuals in the society. We have received 500 letters from readers discussing academic matters, and over 200 people have formally applied to register as regular researchers of this department. The influence of the Reading Q&amp;A section has been even more extensive, as we can see from the letters we receive from other locations. Geographically, we have received letters from readers in all provinces of China, except for Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, wherever the Shen Bao newspaper reaches. They all unanimously approve of our work and enthusiastically request to join the Reading Guidance service, jointly studying practical knowledge needed by everyone. According to the Shen Bao's circulation figures, roughly at least one-third or more of the readers read the Reading Q&amp;A section (over 50,000 people). Among them, the majority not only enjoy reading the "Reading Q&amp;A," but also repeatedly write to inquire about more news regarding our work. They want to know everything about the entire "Reading Guidance" operation.</p>

<p>Zheng Hongnian telegraphed Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, saying: Education Minister Wang Junjian, Ministry of Education, this school's final account statement for January of the 23rd year has been sent, and I believe it has been reviewed by Jun. This school's instruments were almost completely lost after the January 28th Incident, and the school equipment and buildings were also damaged to a considerable extent. The purchase and repair of all instruments, books, and school equipment cost approximately 120,000 to 130,000 yuan in total. They have been listed in the accounts and reported. Check the new instruments in the middle school department and the accounts of various stores in the university and middle school departments. In addition to those that have been paid, there is still a debt of more than 14,000 yuan. Before the unrest in December of the 22nd year, this debt was resolved by the school affairs meeting in November and was to be repaid from the tuition fees collected this semester, and it was estimated that the amount collected would be sufficient to repay the debt and have a surplus. The school's debts should be the responsibility of the entire institution, and the excuse of being handled by the previous person cannot be used to evade responsibility, disregard the credit of the national university, and lose the society's faith in scholars. Moreover, the instruments in the middle school department have been sufficiently used since the previous purchase, and there is no need to purchase them separately this semester. Minister Jun should order Acting Principal Shen to comply with the school's resolution and repay the debt as soon as possible to maintain the school's reputation. I am extremely grateful. Zheng Hongnian bows.</p>

It has now been approved and designated as the 921st Troop. The flags, badges, and seals were issued at the end of last month and forwarded by the Shanghai Boy Scout Council. However, the council only issued them the day before yesterday. It is reported that the troop will soon be traveling to Hangzhou.</p>

<p>China Defeats the United States and Gains the Right to the Final</p>
<p>China's Offense Surges in the Second Half, Leading to the Collapse of the United States' Defense</p>
<p>As a Result, China Wins 38 to 29</p>
<p>—China and Britain to Compete for the Championship Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>In the final triangle match of the International Women's Basketball Championship, China defeated the United States in the preliminary round last night with a score of 38 to 29, eliminating the United States and winning the right to compete against Britain in the final. The final between China and Britain will be held tomorrow night to determine the championship winner.</p>
<p>Subordinate to Others</p>
<p>At the start of the game, the United States' momentum was strong. Although Yang Sen made consecutive free throws, Bennett responded in kind. With the collaboration of Bowsake and Bennett, the United States took the lead with a score of 7 to 2. They were dominant and seemed invincible. Although Yang Sen narrowed the gap by two points, the United States still won the first quarter with a score of 9 to 6, then 11 to 6. Starting from the second quarter, China remained subordinate to others. At 15 to 9, China was trailing by six points, and the situation was precarious and worrying. Pan Meng deployed Chen Rongming and Chen Jucai, and with the combined efforts of Chen and Pan, the score was narrowed to 16 to 13, trailing by only three points. The first half ended temporarily.</p>
<p>Military Might Greatly Enhanced</p>
<p>In the second half, Chen Rongming was deployed again, and China's military might suddenly surged. With overwhelming momentum, they shattered the United States' defense, causing them to be unable to defend on all fronts. Chen Rongming and Yang Sen displayed their prowess, scoring twelve points in a row, reversing the situation and taking the lead with a score of 25 to 16, overwhelming the United States. From then on, everything went smoothly. The United States' strength was depleted. In the third quarter, the score was 30 to 19, with China leading by eleven points. The outcome of the game was largely determined. In the final quarter, the United States was busy adjusting its lineup but was unable to recover. The final score was 38 to 29, with China winning the right to the final.</p>

<p>Announced by the National Sports Association</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, Section C, Article 1, add the following sentence to the note: If the ball is thrown up due to an unstable catch, but its height does not exceed the player's head, it shall not be considered an "illegal scoop."</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, Section C, Article 2, delete the sentence: "When dribbling, the height of the ball bouncing up must be at least equal to the knee of the dribbler."</p>
<p>Add Section D to Chapter 4: Guarding, in its entirety, as follows:</p>
<p>Guarding is an important technique in defense, used to prevent an opponent who has already obtained the ball. When guarding, one arm or both arms can be extended on any plane, but must not touch the ball or the opponent's body. When guarding in a corner of the court, only one arm can be used.</p>
<p>In theory, basketball is a non-contact game, but in reality, because players are running quickly within a limited area, it is impossible to completely avoid physical contact. Such contact should not be penalized if there is no violent behavior. If one unintentionally touches the ball in the opponent's hand or the opponent's body, and immediately releases it, it is also not necessary to penalize.</p>
<p>Revise Article 2 of Chapter 6 in its entirety, as follows:</p>
<p>If the ball goes out of bounds during the game, the player from the team that did not cause the ball to go out of bounds should throw or pass the ball from outside the boundary line at the point where the ball went out of bounds to a player inside the boundary. If the referee or inspector discovers an error, they should immediately correct it, handing the ball to the player with the right to throw the ball into the court. If there is a delay in throwing the ball in after the ball goes out of bounds, it should be considered as "delaying" the game.</p>
<p>Revise the note to Article 2 of Chapter 6 in its entirety, as follows:</p>
<p>If there is not enough space outside the line, players on both sides, except for the thrower, must not approach within three feet of the boundary line. This three-foot distance refers to the entire body of the ball, including the arm.</p>
<p>It would be best to add a thin line three feet inside the boundary line as a standard.</p>
<p>Add the following sentence to Article 1 of Chapter 10, Section A:</p>
<p>If the two teams do not agree on the method of serving, each half can use a different method.</p>
<p>Revise Chapter 10, Section C, Article 2, Item A, (1), as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The players jumping at center court, 1. (Three-zone system) The two team centers should stand with both feet in their own half-circle at center court (the half-circle closer to the opponent's basket). 2. (Two-zone system) The two team centers should stand with both feet in their own half-circle at center court (the half-circle closer to their own basket).</p>
<p>Other players can stand at any location within their own zone, but must not obstruct the actions of the referee, inspector, or centers.</p>
<p>Add Section C to Article 2 of Chapter 11, in its entirety, as follows:</p>
<p>Throwing the ball into the basket after the center circle serve without at least two passes.</p>

<p>Introducing the Latest Sports Knowledge</p>
<p>Instructing Various Sports Methods</p>
<p>In recent years, all levels of society in our country have been vigorously promoting sports. However, there is a lack of sports publications to convey new sports knowledge and modern sports techniques. The Qin Fen Bookstore on Laozhou Father Road in Shanghai, recognizing this, has specially invited national sports experts to publish over a hundred kinds of "Sports Series" books, and also publishes the "Diligent Sports Monthly." It has been published on the tenth of every month since Double Ten Day last year, and has now reached its sixth issue. Special issues on the National Games, elementary school sports, and middle school sports have been published. Sports experts Wu Yunrui, Shen Siliang, Hao Gengsheng, Cheng Dengke, Wu Zheng, Wu Bangwei, Jiang Xiangqing, Shang Rumei, Chen Baiqing, Liu Xuesong, Wang Fudan, Wu Tunan, Chen Kuisheng, Wang Jianwu, and others have all contributed articles. The monthly introduces the latest sports knowledge from around the world, provides teaching materials for primary and secondary school teachers, discusses sports administration issues, instructs on exercise methods, details sports news from China and abroad, and includes a readers' forum. Anyone who reads the monthly can submit articles, regardless of length. In addition to text, the monthly includes a pictorial, publishing photos of sports activities from various places, which is quite interesting. All national sports teachers, athletes, school libraries, and sports enthusiasts should have a copy. The monthly has now become popular throughout the country and is a "steel army" among Chinese magazines. To achieve wider circulation, each issue is sold for only two jiao, and a full year of twelve issues is priced at two yuan. Domestic postage is free, and international postage is an additional one yuan and eight jiao.</p>

<p>The third Youyou Cup Basketball Tournament began last night at the association's basketball hall. The three games last night were tense. Youjia's victory over Shengde was particularly hard-won. Shengde led by two points in the first half. Youjia only caught up in the last five minutes, but the scores were very close. Youjia won the first game by three points. Tuchin has many talented players, including Chen Jiaqiu, Ou Yangzu, and Cai Yanxiong. They still have hopes of winning the championship this year. The Huadong team has average talent, but Quanhong is known for its energy. Jia Youliang, Zhang Qingfu, and Zhou Zhizhi's long-range shots made Huadong's veterans shake their heads. Although Huadong has Lu Zhonghui, Li Baojun, and Lin Zequn, they have not practiced for a long time and are at a disadvantage in terms of physical strength. The results last night were as follows:</p>
<p>Youjia defeated Shengde 46 to 43</p>
<p>Tuchin defeated Leqing 46 to 28</p>
<p>Quanhong defeated Huadong 84 to 32</p>

According to Liang, he has enrolled in the second year of the normal school at the East Asia Physical Education School on the 15th of this month. All school, board, and tuition fees will be borne equally by Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and lawyer Yao Zhaoli. However, Liang is also interested in literature, but lacks a good teacher. He has now decided to study on his own in his spare time and has asked Qian Shiyun, a young writer and specialist member of the Foreign Affairs Discussion Committee of the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to revise his short stories and provide guidance on what literary books to read. Liang Tongfang is very grateful for the kindness shown to him by various parties, who have helped him financially and academically.

<h3 id="e212">On Orchids <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Nineteen</p>
<p>Every early spring, especially at the beginning of the year, busy places in Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou are often filled with people selling orchids. They place bundles of orchids in baskets or arrange them along the roadside, waiting for buyers. These orchid sellers mostly come from Xiaoshan in Zhejiang. They travel to the docks and catch the New Year, simply hoping to make a living. Their lives are quite pitiful. Speaking of orchids, they have been cherished, appreciated, and valued by gentlemen and ladies since ancient times. Confucius was one who cherished orchids. For them, he composed the "Yi Lan Cao." The qin score says: "Confucius, returning to Lu from Wei, saw fragrant orchids growing alone in a secluded valley. He sighed, 'Orchids should be the fragrance of kings, but now they grow alone, associating with common weeds!' He stopped his carriage and played the qin. He lamented his ill-fated time, expressing his feelings through the fragrant orchids." Also, Ling Jun used "fragrant grasses and beautiful women" as metaphors. These are clear evidence. The "Zhen Wei" chapter in the Book of Songs says: "The Zhen and Wei rivers flow broadly, men and women hold orchids." It is said that jian means orchids. Imagine, beside the Zhen and Wei rivers, there are clouds of men and women, holding fragrant orchids in their hands. Common flowers would truly be ashamed in comparison. This is ironclad proof that orchids were loved and appreciated by the ancients. Sworn brotherhood is called "righteous alliance of golden orchids." This is based on the Book of Changes: "When two people are of one heart, their strength can break metal; the words of those of one heart are as fragrant as orchids." Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei formed a brotherhood in Taoyuan, creating a tripartite division of the empire. Which of the heroes on Liangshan Marsh did not go through fire and water, loyal to Song Jiang? All were influenced by the Book of Changes. Although social customs are not as good as in ancient times, there are still many who become enemies the evening after swearing brotherhood in the morning. However, at the beginning of their alliance, did they not hope to be as strong as metal and as fragrant as orchids for the rest of their lives? This is clear evidence that orchids are valued by people.</p>
<p>Today, people prefer novelty and difference. Chrysanthemums, once known for their "reclusive interest," have suffered misfortune, being tied into various shapes by people to cater to vulgar tastes. Fortunately, people still cannot tie up and play with orchids. Although there are exhibitions and gatherings, they are still elegant affairs and not enough to disgrace the orchids. However, according to reports, the puppet state has taken the orchid as its national flower. The reason given is to signify the meaning of forging a lasting "orchid alliance" with Japan. This truly disgraces the orchids. Seeing this, those with a sense of patriotism will probably sing "Nian Jia Shan Po" over and over again. However, if we do not avenge this strange shame, how can we face this "fragrance of kings"? Please, all above and below the nation, think carefully about this.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Taking an X-ray <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Shouzi</p>
<p>Recently, a group of people in Shanghai launched a so-called "TB Prevention Conference." The other day, a certain hospital published its TB prevention opinions, saying that TB is most difficult to detect and treat, so it is best to get an X-ray as soon as one has a respiratory illness, so that it can be determined early whether there is lung disease and treated quickly. This sounds very right. However, to whom are these words addressed? If they are addressed to the rich, that is not a problem. If they are addressed to the general public, that is somewhat of a problem.</p>
<p>It is right to take an X-ray for lung disease. However, how to get everyone to take an X-ray is a matter of debate. We know that those who get lung disease the most are those who are malnourished, overworked, live and eat in unsanitary conditions, have difficulty breathing fresh air, and live in great instability. These people are precisely the world's only poor people. The poor are most prone to illness, the poor are most prone to lung disease (referring to urban poor, especially in Shanghai), and the poor are least likely to treat lung disease. The rich can stay in the hospital to recuperate when they are sick, or they can go to Lushan or Moganshan. But what about the poor? To eat and clothe themselves, no matter how sick they are, they cannot but continue their cattle-and-horse-like work for a living. Let alone recuperation, even taking medicine is probably difficult. Please tell me, in this situation, how can you tell the poor how to see a doctor, how to treat lung disease? As soon as you have a respiratory illness, you should immediately take an X-ray. The words are right, but the actual price of taking an X-ray is 15 yuan, at least more than 10 yuan. Please tell me, who can afford to take it? If all the people who get lung disease are rich, then everything is no problem, and there is no need to promote TB prevention. The rich will naturally go to the hospital to ask for advice. But unfortunately, the people who get lung disease are mostly poor. Please tell me, how can this "TB" be "prevented"? If taking an X-ray can be like the free anti-epidemic shots in the hot weather, with cars sent out to give free shots along the streets, that would still have some "TB prevention" effect (but how to treat it after taking it is still a problem). Otherwise, the so-called "TB prevention" is probably just empty talk?</p>
<p>Don't think I'm talking nonsense. I have a friend who has a very serious lung disease, but because of money problems, he has to leave it untreated. He is not considered very poor, but he cannot afford the 30 yuan per month for a third-class ward (he has to stay for at least one year), not to mention anything else. This is a factual issue. If the problem of money is not solved, any "TB prevention" or "no TB prevention" is empty!</p>

<p>We need brave warriors, and we also need kind nannies. If there is both the bravery of a warrior and the kindness of a nanny, that is the savior of our nation.</p>
<p>"Conscience" has become a past term in this era. If we use a new tone, it should be the so-called "reason"!</p>
<p>In society, there are many men who put on powder, spray perfume, make their heads smooth and their faces fragrant. Some even wear clothes as narrow as women's, with graceful charm and graceful posture. Is this what artists call "sexual sublimation"?</p>
<p>Hypocritical people always stand in front enjoying happiness, and upright people always fall behind suffering. This tells us that now is a world without right and wrong.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p>
<p>Generously Baring Their Hearts, Forgetting Their Families to Serve the Nation</p>
<p>Sadly Gazing into the Mirror, Sighing for Those I Miss</p>
<p>The common people here returned home, but the situation for the garrison troops arriving here gradually became tense. Originally, this battalion of soldiers took advantage of the windy, sandy night to open the pass out of fear of attracting the enemy's attention, or to avoid them using the excuse that Chinese troops had already begun to mobilize and then invading. Chinese troops mobilizing within Chinese territory, yet fearing enemy intervention – this was originally a regrettable matter, but the fact that the transferred troops were actually able to move to their destination without external obstacles was itself rare. However, on the third day after garrisoning, aircraft were discovered in the sky. The aircraft flew over the fort for about half an hour, as if it knew that troops were hidden inside. At this moment, Battalion Commander Bao Fang suddenly issued an order that brothers and civilians were not allowed to look outside the house. Soldiers are required to obey orders, so naturally no one dared to step out. But all the brothers understood in their hearts that this must be an enemy reconnaissance plane. They had long heard from senior officers that China had bought many aircraft, with foreign pilots. Moreover, to prevent enemy aircraft, each unit was allocated anti-aircraft guns or anti-aircraft machine guns. Now, not only had they not seen their own aircraft, but not even a single anti-aircraft gun had been allocated, and they could only watch the enemy's aircraft showing off its power in the sky, unable to resist. With such suspicions, a look of doubt naturally appeared on everyone's faces. An hour after the aircraft passed, Battalion Commander Bao Fang also learned of this situation and called the four company commanders to him. The four company commanders stood side by side facing him, and he stood tall, looking straight ahead, and said with a serious face: Company Commanders, do you know that my initiative brought you to garrison here? The four company commanders stood straight and did not make a sound. (340)</p>

<p>(4) Divisions Formed by Popularization</p>
<p>Since the form and carving of inkstones penetrated deeply into popular culture, they gradually spread among the provinces. Thus, within popularization, different schools emerged. When discussing inkstone making, there are three renowned schools. The works of Guangdong people have a special charm, capable of utilizing stone flaws, stone eyes, and skin to create various patterns to highlight their beauty. The works of Anhui people, such as carvings of fish, dragons, pavilions, and melons, strive for extreme detail, probably because the ink makers and inkstone makers at that time were able to study each other. The works of the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang mostly tend towards elegance and refinement. Scholars and literati who made their own inkstones mostly loved natural charm, writing and carving themselves. Mr. Bando Kanayama of Japan most highly praises this school, and indeed it is meaningful. As for inkstone boxes, inkstone lovers also value them very much. Generally, the materials used are red sandalwood, rosewood, boxwood, and Chinese wolfberry, with the interior coated with qingguang lacquer, or pure lacquer with various carvings and decorations. The inkstone boxes made by workers in Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Anhui, Yangzhou, Suzhou, and Beijing all have different rhythms, colors, and styles, so inkstone boxes also have different schools. If there is a famous work, one can tell which school it belongs to at a glance. This kind of related and associated cultural matter is very complex, so I will not describe it in detail. I will just briefly describe some generalities so that everyone can understand.</p>
<p>(5) Overall Evaluation of Inkstone Material and Art</p>
<p>The art of inkstones reached its peak in the Qing Dynasty, and the development of the Shuikyan of Duanxi also reached its peak. Therefore, those who loved art and those who loved fine inkstone materials but did not emphasize heavy carving, even advocating natural inkstones or simply storing them as stone slabs, were divided into two factions, arguing endlessly, each with their own reasons. However, in our opinion, the main point of an inkstone is ultimately its practicality, so those who discuss inkstones must first study the material. If the material is truly good, then adding exquisite inscriptions and carvings, as well as all kinds of beautiful decorations, will only enhance its beauty. If the material is not good, but the appearance is merely decorated, it is no different from having gold and jade on the outside but decaying cotton inside, which is not desirable at all. On the other hand, if there is excellent inkstone material, but it is carelessly carved by vulgar merchants, falsely impersonating famous inscriptions, then it is no different from putting dung on a Buddha's head, as the inkstone book says, "forcefully pretending to understand, defiling this Duan friend," which is even more regrettable. Therefore, if there is good inkstone material but no exquisite inscriptions, then it is better to remain simple and uncarved. Even if it is stored as a stone slab, it is still a fine product. This is the fair opinion of the general public. The relationship between inkstones and art is generally like this. Below, I will talk about the essence of inkstones.</p>

<p>(2) Nice on the Azure Coast</p>
<p>France is truly a paradise on earth. I will temporarily put aside the bustling urban landscape of Paris, which is second to none in the world, and first make a sketch of the natural scenery.</p>
<p>Geographically, France occupies a special advantage, with one coast facing the Mediterranean Sea winding around to ancient cultural lands, and the other coast along the North Sea looking out to the new world. Other countries naturally also have fascinating characteristics. For example, Italy is full of art and history, often under a permanently azure sky, shrouded in a happy climate. Switzerland is world-famous for its mountains and rivers, a great garden of humanity under the northern sky.</p>
<p>In southern France, there is a place called the "Azure Coast" (CÔTE D'AZUR), which is the world's famous resort for both winter and summer. It combines the advantages of both Italy and Switzerland. This is a dream world, with a spring climate all year round, a coast without winter. The lovely sun warms the soil in winter, and does not burn the skin of tourists in summer. From the beginning to the end of the year, beautiful flowers and trees are often blooming in the garden.</p>
<p>Important politicians, entrepreneurs, wealthy people, celebrities, actors, and tycoons from the golden countries of the New World and stars from Hollywood in various countries on the European continent all embark on journeys in winter, gathering on the "Azure Coast" to vacation and avoid the cold, chasing and frolicking under that lovely and warm sun.</p>
<p>The most famous place on this "Azure Coast" is Nice. The name Nice is a transliteration that has evolved from the Greek word MIKE, and its meaning is "victory." Many buildings from the ancient Roman Empire are still preserved there today. In 1860, the local population was only 26,000, but today it has surged to over 184,000, not including the tens of thousands of tourists who come every year.</p>
<p>In terms of natural scenery, there is a warm and lovely sun, azure skies and sea, golden beaches, the foothills of the Alps, shady olive trees, and various fragrant and exotic flowers, trees, and fruits. Nice's "Flower Market" and "Flower Festival" are world-famous. In the quieter countryside, one can see houses with walls basking in the sun everywhere, rose-colored roof tiles, surrounded by ivy or climbing morning glories. On the ochre soil, grapes, mulberries, olives, and all kinds of pine and cypress trees grow.</p>
<p>In terms of artificial construction, the ancient ones include churches and castles from the fifteenth century, for archaeologists to touch; modern ones include a "British Promenade" that can accommodate twenty people walking side by side, which is the largest promenade in the world. Tourists of various countries and ethnicities wander there from morning to night. Most notable are those women wearing large-brimmed straw hats and "Indian pants" with large trouser legs. They wear sleeveless, bare-chested swimsuits on their upper bodies and lead a Pekingese dog in their hands. There are also women wearing black clothes with black veils, who look like young widows from a distance. However, one can see many girls in that kind of clothing all over the street. It is said that these are the most popular women's fashions in Nice in 1933.</p>
<p>Nice has many歌臺舞塲, all of which are built very luxuriously. The most famous is the "Jetty Games Park" (ASINO DE JETEE), built on the sea, surrounded by the sea on all sides, entirely constructed of steel, and extremely sturdy. It has a dance hall, a theater, and a casino, much like Shanghai's Great World. In addition, there is Europe's most aristocratic hotel, the NEGREICO, and the most modern "Mediterranean Palace" (unfortunately destroyed by fire last winter), as well as the world-famous casino "Monte Carlo" (MONTE ORRLO), which is only a few hours away from Nice.</p>
<p>I think readers now have a fairly general impression of Nice on the "Azure Coast." Next time, I will talk about the lively celebrations of various festivals in Nice.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Foolish and Flattering <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhizhi</p>
<p>Society only sees its lack of peace, and there are only more and more strange things. In the distance, there is the matter of enthusiastically welcoming a fly-by-night as a great writer, followed by Liang Zuoyou's big scene in Nanjing, followed by children marching in snow and wind to raise donations, of course for the sake of saving the country, followed by…</p>
<p>Those with a little conscience are amazed, saddened, and sigh at the many strange things they see. Many people's actions are like the result of too many spins, dizzy and disoriented. Examining the reasons, the first is ignorance, and the second is the desire to deliberately please. These two temperaments combine to become a kind of madness. The pitiful modern citizens, many live in this state of madness.</p>
<p>In fact, this has been going on for quite some time. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, someone said… "Every family has a semi-idle hall, everything is like children's play, things are mostly so-so, and the world is also carefree." Looking closely at many things now, it is almost the same situation, except that we may not "every family has a semi-idle hall" anymore.</p>
<p>Actions in this madness are roughly like this… First, there is a noisy commotion, making a confusing situation, such as holding a big meeting, making a commotion, and then everything remains the same. Second, many things are damaged because of this. Because of ignorance or flattery, one cannot say that they are bad-hearted. For example, a porcelain shop catches fire, and bowls, plates, bottles, and jars are smashed to pieces. In the past, many treaties were hastily and confusedly signed, out of ignorance and lack of foresight, and the Republic of China was therefore harmed. Descendants will have burdens, thinking that foreigners were therefore impressed, but not knowing that they are laughing in their hearts at our foolishness and deceiving our weakness. Third, it is no small matter. Change is easy to make people ashamed. Shamed anger, human nature, who pointed out mistakes and exposed the dark, but aroused "reverse", in the front of the executive government at that time, there were girls who bled, many people lost their lives, is caught by this madness is working and will work, should get rid of the old dark, lose the slave heart, and ask for some common sense!</p>
<h3 id="e220">On Pouring Cold Water <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Kangde</p>
<p>My hometown is the same as Mr. Xu Maoyong's hometown: "When people are excitedly absorbed in something, someone, or something, someone suddenly makes a statement of enlightenment to dampen their enthusiasm" is "called 'pouring cold water'". For example, a young lady who has been married for nearly ten years and has not had a son suddenly has an enlarged belly and is excitedly absorbed in burning incense to thank the child-giving goddess, someone suddenly says to her, "Your husband hasn't been home for over a year. Your enlarged belly may be a result of the long-term humiliation from your mother-in-law for not being able to bear a son. It's better to save the money for incense and candles and ask a doctor to diagnose it." That person is the "cold water pourer". Whether this cold water is a "soft knife that kills without seeing blood" or a "head-on blow" seems to depend on whether the young lady's enlarged belly is a swelling or a pregnancy. If, unfortunately, the swelling is true, then the young lady's joy at the imminent birth will be completely swept away, and she will inevitably be discouraged, but saving the money for incense and candles to use as diagnosis money is not without practical benefit. Therefore, the right and wrong of pouring cold water depends on whether the things or people that the person being poured on is absorbed in are appropriate or not.</p>
<p>After Puyi ascended the throne, it is said that the old remnants from various places excitedly sent telegrams of congratulations. At this time, someone suddenly made a statement of enlightenment saying…"Puyi is just a puppet. It's better to pay homage to Puyi's photo and shout 'Long live!' than to be a subject to a puppet." This is also pouring cold water on the old remnants, but no one would dare to say that this cold water is a soft knife that kills without seeing blood, even though the old remnants may be discouraged because of it. The cold water pourer originally wanted the other party to be discouraged and to be less of a disgrace to the nation. Therefore, even if the old remnants commit suicide by drowning or hanging themselves because of discouragement, the cold water pourer does not need to feel guilty, saying, "Although I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me." Also, for example, if there is a guy who only knows how to beat his wife at home and doesn't dare to make a sound at a strong neighbor who has slapped him ten times, suddenly sees that strong neighbor scolding another neighbor and is about to roll up his sleeves and arms to fight for justice, someone suddenly says, "You should just stay home and beat your wife." This statement is also pouring cold water, but it is not necessarily a soft knife that kills without seeing blood. Also, for example, pouring a cold cup of water on someone who doesn't measure their virtue or ability and is determined to clarify the universe, acting recklessly and making the universe a mess, can really be said to be a great deed. If he really turns back to his old business of mending vats, because of this cold water.</p>
<p>In short, whether pouring cold water is a soft knife that kills without seeing blood depends on who is being poured on and what they are doing. It cannot be dismissed with one stroke. Otherwise, the world will be full of things that pat buttocks, lick legs, and sail with the wind. Can the affairs of the state be done? Because now the person who pours cold water are doing this to "enthusiastic youth" so I write this essay to those like Xu Maoyong who are enthusiastic and caring about the youth.</p>

<p>— Wei Li</p>
<p>XX:</p>
<p>I remember when we set off to come to Guangzhou last year, a friend came to the ship to see us off. He said to me, "Really silly, going to Guangzhou to teach!" At the time, I was a little confused, but now I know that what he said was right. I really did something stupid.</p>
<p>Before setting off, I also inquired about Guangzhou from friends. All they told me was that Guangzhou's weather is very hot, the cost of living is very high, and also, the Guangdong people's silver dollars are "pushed back" a bit more than our silver dollars. At the time, I thought that this little loss was nothing important, so I decided to come to Guangzhou. Who knew that when I got here, I saw that there were so many tricks! Today, I want to talk to you about the donations in Guangzhou City.</p>
<p>It's best to start with the salary. In our school, professors from other provinces are considered to be treated very well, with a monthly salary of four hundred silver dollars. Anyone who writes this number on paper will say that it is grand and respectable, but… but the fact is another matter. When we receive our salary every month, we have to pay 4% income donation, we have to pay 4% party headquarters fund donation, and we also have to pay 1.5 silver dollars for the volunteer army donation (said to be sent to Guanwai for the Northeast Volunteer Army to fight). These three items add up to a total of 33.5 silver dollars. I remember the first time I received my salary last year, we also subscribed to a share of the Guangdong Cooperative (?), costing 10 silver dollars. I heard that everyone who teaches has to be a shareholder, but the cooperative stock has not been sent yet. This is from the school's perspective.</p>
<p>You know, I came with my family. The school doesn't have a place for teachers to live with their families, so we rent a house outside. Logically speaking, rent in Guangzhou City is not too expensive, much cheaper than Nanjing—and it's easy to find a livable house. Renting a house in Guangzhou City, in addition to the rent, you also have to pay "house donation police fee". This is stipulated by the Public Security Bureau. The house donation accounts for 15% of the rent. For example, we currently pay 43 silver dollars in rent every month, so we have to pay 6.45 silver dollars in house donation, which is divided equally between the landlord and us. We ourselves have to pay 0.2 silver dollars in cleaning fees every month. In addition, there are many temporary additional donations. I'm considered lucky, having lived in Guangzhou for half a year and not having donated a single cent yet. But I saw on the donation certificate issued by the Public Security Bureau that there were many "rent donations" that had already been collected. I calculated that from 1923 to 1933, there were a total of nineteen kinds of donations. Now I'll just write a few down… "January 1923 rent loan", "1926 bandit suppression strike", "1926 Northern Expedition", "1927 strike subsidy", "1932 national salvation half-month", "1933 air defense phase one", "1933 air defense phase two", "1933 national salvation six days"… There are so many names, but unfortunately the amount of each donation is not written out, otherwise it would be a very valuable statistical material.</p>
<p>In Guangzhou, it's not just donating to live in a house, you also have to donate to use electric lights. Last month, my family used seventeen degrees of electricity, and the electricity bill calculated to be exactly 3.4 silver dollars. But the Guangzhou Electricity Management Committee's collector asked me to pay an extra 0.34 silver dollars. I heard that this is an additional "education fee", and I only then understood that using electric lights and running education are actually related. There is a donation for electric lights, and there must also be a donation for telegrams, because the electricity for them is the same, so why are they treated differently? I sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday. The telegram fee calculated to be 1.2 silver dollars, but the surcharge cost 0.36 silver dollars (30%). Fortunately, there are now two airmail flights between Shanghai and Guangzhou every week, so we can also lose a little less.</p>
<p>These donations naturally cannot include all of Guangzhou City's donations. I'm just casually talking to you about what I've donated. You think, how much can a teacher earn every month? This donation, that donation, how can you bear to donate? Standing on the podium every day, drinking chalk dust and selling</p>
<p>life for others, isn't that stupid?</p>
<p>In fact, the loss from just donating is limited after all. The most terrible thing is the monster that sucks our blood, and its name is "unredeemed banknotes". I'll tell you about this next time.</p>

<p>— Lu Yan</p>
<p>1.  Before leaving Shanghai, I was wrapped and tied up again. Moving, traveling, calculating, almost every year I tie up my bedding and baggage, and several times, I've tied them up three or four times in a year.</p>
<p>"I'm going to tie you up, I'm going to take you to another place." I said to the bedding and baggage.</p>
<p>So the baggage, without resisting, allowed me to tie it up and let me take it away.</p>
<p>Its fate is entirely in my hands. However, what about my own fate? It is in the hands of another who does not know me.</p>
<p>"I'm going to tie you up, I'm going to take you to another place!" the person reaching out to me said.</p>
<p>So I was led away.</p>
<p>Every time, it's like this. It's still the same this time.</p>
<p>What kind of journey will the baggage go through? What kind of place will it be placed in? - It does not know.</p>
<p>I, too, cannot know what I will encounter, what I will see, what kind of life I will live, whether it will be joy or sorrow, whether it will be or death. Lisa is looking at me, wanting me to hug her. She doesn't know that I am her father, let alone that I am leaving. Just as I don't know what I will encounter.</p>
<p>Enge knows that I am leaving, but he doesn't know that I am going to a very far place. He thinks that I will come back the same day as usual. Just as Lisa doesn't know that I am leaving.</p>
<p>Lili knows that it will be a long time before I can come back, but she doesn't know why I am leaving. She is just like Enge, who doesn't know that I won't be back immediately.</p>
<p>Lan and Mother know everything. They know why I am leaving, and when I will be able to return. But they are just like me, unable to know what I will encounter, and unable to know what they themselves will encounter. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e224">Spring (Continued) <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Everything is spring, everyone has spring, only my heart is cold and lonely, spring has passed from me!</p>
<p>Suddenly a big hand patted me on the shoulder, and a young man wearing a dark blue Western suit stood in front of me. I blankly raised my head to look at him. I recognized him. He was my friend Ping, a friend Ping who was intoxicated in a happy love dream.</p>
<p>"Ping, it's you." I excitedly shook his hand. I was thinking that his passionate words might warm my heart. But immediately I was disappointed. I saw his face, a melancholy face, with disillusionment and sadness in his eyes. Those dim, lackluster eyes! As soon as I saw them, I knew that an arrow of despair had shot the young man's heart. His heart was already dead.</p>
<p>"Ping, what are you worried about?" I couldn't help asking him. "I'm finished! She fell in love with a bureaucrat and abandoned me!" He shook his head, saying painfully, with tears in his voice.</p>
<p>He was walking the path I had walked in the past. This unfortunate young man also no longer had spring in his life. How should I comfort him? In front of a heartbroken person, all words of comfort are ineffective. I have this kind of experience. I can only exchange glances with him sympathetically, and accompany him on that unpleasant journey.</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of life!" he sighed, his voice as light and ghostly as falling flowers drifting to the surface of the water.</p>
<p>"Life is pain. But let us forget everything!"</p>
<p>"Okay! Forget everything!" he said, his eyes flashing, with a little brilliance in them. But this brilliance was short-lived, and soon disappeared.</p>
<p>So, we went to a restaurant, a restaurant decorated with Eastern classical flavors. Each holding the bitter cup of life, silently drinking the blood-like wine in the cup. Forgetting the era, forgetting life, forgetting love, and forgetting spring.</p>
<p>The sound of light clinking glasses rang out from time to time in the air, and empty wine bottles lined the table. We were both a little drunk. I staggered to my feet, poured the only half cup of wine left in my hand on the ground, and said dreamily…</p>
<p>"Pour a libation to this unpleasant spring!</p>
<p>I hope that a hopeful spring will come next year."</p>
<p>He smiled, and I smiled too. Our two pairs of eyes looked at each other, and both eyes contained crystal tears.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Evening (9) <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>"It's not even ten o'clock yet, and I'm already so sleepy!"</p>
<p>"Me too, my waist is a little sore."</p>
<p>"Then let's go to sleep."</p>
<p>So they called the maid, who made the bed for them. They changed their clothes and went to bed. The maid turned off the lights for them. They seemed eager to fall asleep and didn't say a word. Qing Song gently turned over because the moonlight was shining on her face. But she still couldn't fall asleep. She watched Qing Zhi's motionless body as she slept and heard the sound of goldfish spitting water. But no matter what, she couldn't seem to fall asleep. Her heart was always thinking about something, vague yet with a deep sense of melancholy. She closed her eyes, wishing she would never open them again, but it was still no use. She silently counted the swings of the wall clock, from one to a thousand, to two thousand; she was still so awake, even though she was anxious, there was nothing she could do.</p>
<p>She simply turned back over, letting the moonlight shine on her face. She opened her eyes wide and looked at the scenery bathed in the moonlight, thinking that the moonlight might wash away the depression in her chest.</p>
<p>The tall trees in the autumn night were rustling mournfully as they were blown by the wind, and the wall clock struck twelve again.</p>
<p>She let out a long, faint sigh.</p>
<p>"Sister, are you not asleep either?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know why, I can't sleep!" Qing Song turned her body towards Qing Zhi again.</p>
<p>"I heard you turn over and thought you were asleep."</p>
<p>Qing Song didn't say anything more, just gazed silently in the moonlight. The cold currents of the late autumn night air made her shiver.</p>
<p>"Are you cold?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't know why I shivered."</p>
<p>The wall clock chimed leisurely.</p>
<p>"It's already one o'clock." Qing Zhi showed a little surprise.</p>
<p>"The long night is almost over." Qing Song said sadly.</p>
<p>"Sister, we must get a good night's sleep."</p>
<p>Qing Zhi put her arms around Qing Song's body, face to face, sleeping on one pillow, dripping onto the white sheets.</p>
<p>They hugged each other tightly, and in the silence, there was their light, soft sobbing. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e226">Many Unfavorable Factors in Silver Case, Bid Price Rebounds Five and a Half Yuan <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was quite stable yesterday. US silver rose only slightly. The prospects for the silver case are unfavorable. Market sentiment is better. Early morning trading showed silver markets in England and America both rising. The price of silver on the Shanghai Gold Exchange for forward contracts was close to flat, but then rose by more than ten pounds. Exchange rates were flat. US cotton fell by two pounds. US wheat rose slightly. Stocks fell by 1.07 yuan. The opening price for wool rose slightly. After the opening, market sentiment was not very strong. Banks also supplied silver. The market seemed weak, but because large players kept buying, the price gradually rose. Later, because local merchants were eagerly buying US currency, the domestic market tightened and market sentiment also became stable, so the price rose to around sixty yuan. Banks took advantage of the high price to sell, putting up quite a struggle. At noon, because the foreign exchange market was still tight, the price broke through sixty yuan.</p>
<p>Outside the customs, private telegrams reported that the US silver case seemed unlikely to be favorable. The afternoon market was flat. Later, because Chinese merchants continued to buy US currency, the domestic market suddenly tightened and the price rose again, but the *Shanghai Evening Post* reported that the US House of Representatives was discussing the silver case and it seemed likely to pass, so the price of gold fell back below sixty yuan. The trend was uncertain. The three-month contract lacked sellers. Buyers were aggressively covering short positions, and the price was almost at parity with the settlement price. The swap spread was between two and three yuan. The price of gold was 970 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 955.7 yuan, up 3 yuan from last Saturday.</p>
<p>The opening price for physical goods was 5.6 yuan. The opening exchange rates were 1 shilling 4 3/8 pence for the near-term selling price for the British pound and 34.6875 yuan for the US dollar. CBC was selling June US dollars at 0.0625. Heng Yu was selling strips. Although Banca Italia, Yung Ta, and Teh Cheng were buying, the price still fell to 4.6 yuan. Yuan Mao</p>
<p>and Yung Hsin were aggressively buying, but they could not push the price down further. Chinese merchants were eager to buy. Mitsui was buying July US dollars at 0.125 again. Banca Italia, Yung Ta, Teh Cheng, An Lee, Qian Changxiang, Yuan Mao, Yung Hsin and others were delivering strips. The price then rose to 7.4 yuan. When the HSBC exchange rate was announced, the British pound was flat and the US dollar rose by 0.0125. Market sentiment was still flat. After fluctuating, JPM was selling June US dollars at 0.09375. Hong Lee sold off, and the price fell to 6.3 yuan. Heng Yu was buying strips. It suddenly became difficult to settle June US dollars at 0.09375, so although Heng Xing and Rui Kang were selling, Zhi Feng, Yung Ta, Teh Cheng, Yuan Heng, Qian Changxiang, Sheng Da, and others were competing to buy, and the price rose to 9.7 yuan. Citibank was offering April US dollars at 0.0625 and May US dollars at 0.075. CBC was selling June dollars at 0.0875. Heng Yu, Fu An, Ri Chang, Qian Changxiang, Banca Italia, and Yung Hsin sold off, and the price fell below 8 yuan.

In the afternoon, buyers suddenly rushed to cover short positions.

<p>Because a telegram from London reported that the London prime rate had risen by 0.01875, US silver rose by 0.0025, and forward silver prices rose slightly but not by much, the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was flat, the exchange rate between the US dollar and the French franc was 0.0025, private telegrams showed no increase or decrease in silver prices and exchange rates, the morning opening price for the near-term selling price for the British pound was 1 shilling 4 3/8 pence, and the US dollar was 34.6875 yuan, which was flat for the British pound and tighter by 0.0625 for the US dollar compared to last Saturday.

<p>Commodities Gradually Begin to Move</p>
<p>Financial Market Sentiment Improves</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Lunar New Year, there have been no good news stories to report in the financial markets. The past few weeks have been uneventful and chaotic. However, starting this week (yesterday), foreign banks have been more active in foreign exchange transactions, and import and export merchants in this city have gradually begun to move goods, so the situation is gradually improving. Although the interest rate on interbank loans in the market was still 2% in the morning and afternoon, the interest rate on overdrafts also reached 2-3%. In the morning, over 4.3 million was transacted, with over 500,000 in new transactions. In the afternoon, over 300,000 was transacted. Over 500,000 was transacted in the Small General Association.

<h3 id="e229">Securities and Bond Market Thrives <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>—Up Two, Three Cents to Sixty, Seventy Cents Across the Board—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange was still very strong. There were rumors in the market that new loans were being established. The facts still need to be confirmed. Although there were large players taking profits, large players covering short positions and new players were particularly enthusiastic. Market sentiment was high and stable. There were no signs of pullback in the near future. Interbank rates were getting lower and silver was getting looser. Shanghai's current cash reserves were particularly abundant. Bank deposit rates were low and there was an abundance of idle capital. There were many buyers with reserves to take delivery, so there was no major problem. Therefore, veteran long players were reluctant to sell, and new long players were even more eager to buy. Short players have not been able to find a way out for over a month. They even added to their positions during the last period of consolidation. Now they have actually returned their gains, covering their positions and adding to their positions. There were also those who turned from short to long, which gave the market the excellent appearance of soaring prices. New high prices were found repeatedly in each trading session. From the "18 Customs" bond to the short-term gold bond, the near-term and forward contracts for all ten bonds set new high price records. This kind of bullish trend was not subject to environmental control, but was entirely due to the abundance of strength and the supply and demand relationship of the bonds, so the bullish trend was strong and firm and not easy to stop in the short term. The course of yesterday, from morning to evening, was a very stable and slight increase in each trading session, mostly up one or two cents to three or four cents. However, the current month salt tax contract fell slightly by one or two cents at the close, but afterwards there were no signs of a fall. Transactions were brisk with the sale of contracts numbered 5, 38, and 54, and the purchase of contracts numbered 9, 16, and 53. The amount being observed was still not satisfied. There were still many retail short positions, and some were covering their positions. It is expected that the salt tax will reach 65% off. We will wait and see. As a result of market prices, they rose from two, three cents to sixty, seventy cents. The total number of transactions was 14,429,200 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in cash and 14,429,000 yuan in futures. The results of the high, low, rise and fall are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>A report from New Feng Foreign Firm on the 27th stated that the New York stock market fell again due to profit-taking by long players. It was feared that labor disputes next week would not be optimistic. At the same time, people were uneasy about the results of the discussion on the management of the exchange. It was difficult to predict the passage of silver legislation on Monday, so silver mining stocks were sold off. New York prosecutor Panchera inspected the exchange, but did not express an opinion. The Yang City Tang Iron production rate decreased from 56% to 54%. The market recovered slightly before closing due to short covering. The volume of transactions in half a day was 730,000 shares. (Wheat) There were strong winds in the wheat-producing area, and the spot market position was very tight. Do not sell short. (Cotton) The future plans of farmers, merchants, and textile manufacturers are largely determined by reduced planting legislation, and reduced planting plans will continue to be modified and affected by labor disputes. All parties are now gradually paying attention to the possibility of increased foreign cotton production. The market was unusually calm. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and recovered in the afternoon, but the situation gradually showed signs of consolidation. Because most people were seeing the unfavorable environment, they all held the view of selling when prices rose. However, some manufacturers absorbed the amount and refused to relax their grip, so the market became volatile again. Real sales were sluggish and pressure was still heavy. However, cotton prices were high and the factory was losing money.</p>
<p>Heavy Pressure on Marked Yarn</p>
<p>The foreign cotton market was flat at the opening of the marked yarn market. There were rumors in the commercial market, and the air became suddenly empty and a selling trend started again. Golden Rooster marked yarn once fell below the 80 yuan mark. After bidding to the second or third bid, it rebounded again. As a result, each month fell by 0.58 yuan to 1.12 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn sales were still good, and each month rose by 0.136 yuan. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 29,500 bales.

<h3 id="e233">Mediocre Conditions in the Cotton Exchange <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is unremarkable, lacking any brilliance. Due to the stability of American cotton and the pending review of the Bingham bill, which is partly expected to pass, there is optimism about cotton prices. However, sellers are generally concerned about the sluggish yarn market and rumors of workforce reductions. Additionally, Indian cotton market prices are weakening, and the desire to short sell persists. Currently, Japanese cotton mills are steadily developing, but according to today's news, there has not been sufficient delivery for this month.</p>
<p>Weak Trading in Zheng Biao Cotton</p>
<p>The opening of the cotton exchange saw a weak market due to poor American cotton performance, leading to strong selling pressure. Prices fell by five to twelve cents across various months.

<p>Last week, the market turned firm, with progress in actual positions after a bullish phase. Simultaneously, industry players were encouraged by news of Far East purchases of "White Russell" cotton. However, prices did not rise due to a lack of new stimulus. In the spot market, activity was relatively high, with considerable inquiries from Japan and interest from local factories. European transactions remained stagnant. The following is a summary of statistics for the past week (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3 id="e235">Grain Millers Buy Back Recent Flour <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a trend of initial stability followed by rising prices in various months after the opening bell. Quotations for foreign wheat remained relatively stable, with Chicago wheat at 8/8 of a cent and Canadian wheat at 1/10 of a cent. Consequently, market activity was calm as usual after the opening. Later, as millers continued to withhold offers, and given the imminent settlement of the current month's contracts, millers, despite the lack of major transactions by outside speculators, autonomously bought back due to other considerations, leading to a positive sentiment in the near term, with the long term slightly following suit.</p>
<p>By the afternoon opening, the current month saw millers engaging in spread trading, buying back near-term contracts and selling long-term ones. Outside speculators were both buying and selling, with actual sales remaining limited. Based on the current situation, millers may have other intentions, such as absorbing near-term contracts to maintain standards. As a result, the current month was better by 1.75 cents compared to the previous week, April was better by 2 cents, May was better by 1.25 cents, June was better by 0.5 cents, July was up 0.75 cents, and August was better by 0.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e236">July Wheat Stands Out with a 4-Cent Gain <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market showed a slight bullish trend. Foreign wheat quotations saw minimal fluctuations, with Chicago wheat at 8/8 of a cent and Canadian wheat at 1/10 of a cent. However, market inventory was extremely limited. With the current month nearing settlement, trading volume was naturally low. The long-term outlook was subject to varied observations, leading to a generally cautious stance. June contracts, which had been offered in the morning, turned bullish, opening at 71 cents and later decreasing by 0.02 cents, ultimately closing up 0.07 cents compared to the previous week. July and August saw little trading. Ultimately, July was better by 4 cents, while there were no comparisons for the others. Based on this year's weather, industry insiders predict that future harvests will not be hopeless, so a sluggish trend should be watched for in the future. The current wheat market is smooth and prices are stable as mills are already active. Prices opened at 3.48 yuan for Bengbu wheat and 3.55 yuan for Yingzhou wheat, with a total of 3,000 bags reportedly handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Glutinous Rice Market Stagnant, Continues Slight 0.05 Yuan Decline <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's sources for outside speculators were mostly from the 46th and 47th districts (over 7,000 piculs), with late rice being the most abundant and nearly the 30th district showing signs of tightening. However, only Nanyang speculators were actively purchasing, with Beiyang speculators quickly ceasing activity, causing a sudden shift in the market, which turned soft. Together, the Nanyang and Beiyang speculators totaled 3,000 bags. The market for Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and other goods seemed to hold steady, but the trend may decline. Although the supply of thick glutinous rice from various speculators was not abundant, sales in both urban and rural areas were particularly sluggish, resulting in a very quiet market. The market was weak, causing prices of Changbang, Sutong, Nangang, and other varieties to fall by another 0.05 yuan. The supply and demand for Duyangjian were still well-matched, remaining stable, while the change in Yuan was similar to before.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 17th and 18th district goods arrived at the port from various locations along the river. Sales on the market remained slow. However, Zhongguan white glutinous rice showed a slight improvement, with prices of high-quality white glutinous rice approaching a 0.1 yuan increase, and prices of medium-grade and lower-grade white glutinous rice were reduced by several cents. Yangdujian, Baiyuan, and Yinyuan also decreased by a small amount, while Bu Jian, Ke Jian, early rice, and thin rice saw flat and weak prices.</p>

<p>—Prices Soar—</p>
<p>Orchid seeds produced in Zhangzhou have long been sold out in Shanghai, and with the source cut off for a long time, there are many inquiries. The market is firm and the price has soared by more than ten yuan. Yesterday, it was heard that a batch had arrived on the Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel steamer, totaling five boxes. Samples have already been viewed, and their color is delicate and yellowish, and the asking price is 50 yuan, and it is estimated that a transaction can be made today. Since being affected by local factory cakes and Wenzhou cakes, the arrival of large soft cakes from Xiamen has also decreased. Yesterday, it was heard that the Jinan wheel steamer also transported a batch of about eleven to ten boxes, priced at about 26 or 27 yuan. As the sales in Shanghai are still active, it may be cleared.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Sugar Market: Another Batch of Zhangzhou Raw Sugar Arrives <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the sugar market saw a consistent rise in both spot and customs duties, actual sales remained sluggish. Public sentiment in the association remained difficult to boost. The asking price for 24 coarse sand white sugar was 19.75 yuan, but no sales were made. Taikoo B mark was at 20.15 yuan, No. 9 Dutch red was at 15.85 yuan, and No. 8 was at 15.7 yuan, with scattered transactions. Although the ground price of Chaozhou raw sugar was firm, the attitude of the industry was cautious as shipments had not moved in Shanghai. Yesterday, 107 bags of Zhangzhou raw sugar were transported by the Jinan wheel steamer, and it was heard that the cost still required more than 11 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of pure antimony from Hunan rose by another 2 yuan, estimated at 312 yuan per ton. Although there were no large transactions, there were still many scattered trades, so sentiment was high. Consequently, the asking price for new arrivals was still good.</p>

<p>—Thin Man</p>
<p>Nowadays, people pay attention to appearances. Clothes must be beautiful, and grooming must be neat, so that when you approach people, they won't dislike you. Even in all aspects of eating, living, socializing, and entertainment, appearances are essential. Appearance is the only key to getting along in today's world. No matter how poor your family is or how difficult your finances are, you can't ignore appearances. Even if you are short on money, you must still put on a lavish show when you go out. As the people of Suzhou say, "Soft clothes on your body, but no rice for dinner at home," that's the idea. Today's society is one that values appearance above all else. If you don't have appearances, you will be scorned everywhere. If you have appearances, even when you go to a shop to buy something, the clerks will treat you with special courtesy, and when you go to a restaurant, the waiters will bow to you a few extra times. In fact, this society is inherently snobbish.</p>
<p>Why is this society fundamentally snobbish? It's because it's too difficult for everyone to get enough to eat. Because it is difficult to get enough to eat, those who can get enough to eat become extraordinarily noble. By contrast, most people who cannot get enough to eat become extraordinarily inferior. In this way, differences in wealth arise in society. Furthermore, because of the differences in wealth, everyone loves to take the path of wealth and does not want to take the path of poverty, so poverty becomes the target of public criticism.</p>
<p>In fact, society never originally had any concept of higher or lower; these are all man-made. Because people are selfish and self-interested (naturally, this is entirely determined by objective economic conditions), society has developed hierarchies; the differences in society are nothing more than man-made relationships. For example, as mentioned earlier, people, in order to maintain appearances, cannot help but spend all their income on outward appearances, enduring hunger and cold at all costs; also, he should have bought a book to read, but because of appearance concerns, he has to take the money for buying books to buy beautiful clothes to wear. Knowledge can be neglected, but appearance must be maintained. Extending this further, workers doing work and farmers cultivating fields should always try to increase their knowledge and pay attention to technical improvements, but because of the necessities of life, they cannot spare any more thought or energy for this. Therefore, people are forced to maintain appearances due to the pressures of life, and as a result, life becomes even more difficult to secure due to appearances. So, how can people forget the "problem of life" and devote themselves to the progress of society? This requires a fundamental transformation of the objective social conditions that make "life" a "problem." Naturally, this is a big problem.</p>

<p>At this moment, Jinmei brought me a basin of hot water to wash my face, turned around and retreated, bumped into Guan Baomei, and said...</p>
<p>"Look, Third Brother is crying again, he always can't get over it, he's only thirty years old, and he's already afraid of not having a son to support him in his old age." Her voice was low and she disappeared into the inner room.</p>
<p>"He's been crying even more since Mom passed away." I vaguely heard Baomei reply with these two sentences.</p>
<p>"Ah! It turns out that Third Brother is so anxious because he hasn't had any children yet!" I pressed down on his hidden sorrow and said.</p>
<p>"Ugh ugh ugh"! He cried even louder.</p>
<p>"Just crying isn't right, you can talk about your worries"! I gently persuaded him.</p>
<p>"I really don't know what bad things I did in my previous life to suffer such retribution in this life. Fourth Brother has two sons, but only I,..."</p>
<p>"Third Brother, how can you force this? It's good to have a son, but if you don't, it's not worth being so sad! You need to know that the meaning of life is not just about having children.</p>

It's impossible to even see them one last time before they die. I really feel endless sorrow! What's the point of having a son!"</p>

<p>—Qian Xu</p>
<p>A thing is naturally viewed differently from different perspectives. For example, when a writer is working, he smokes a cigarette. To himself, it certainly has great significance, because without it, it seems impossible to get "inspiration" to spring from his brain, and he uses it as a tool to excite his nerves. However, in the eyes of ordinary people—especially those who don't like smoking—it feels like a small "waste."</p>
<p>For example, a friend of mine was careless on a bus, and his hat was snatched by a young rascal, who sold the ten-yuan呢 hat to a middleman for two yuan. For my friend, it was certainly a loss, needless to say, and the young rascal only got two-tenths of the price, which also seems like a "waste." However, according to economic principles, this "waste" is not valid. Because although my friend suffered a loss, and the young rascal only got a very low price, the middleman gained a profit, and at the same time, another buyer got a bargain. There was no change in the hat itself.</p>
<p>What I want to propose in this article is waste in a broader sense.</p>
<p>Why has our country become so weak since the Qing Dynasty revolution, in just over twenty years? It is almost in a state of utter ruin. Everyone knows that it was caused by years of natural and man-made disasters, internal strife, and foreign aggression. In recent years, the development of capitalism and the surplus of goods in industrial countries have all used our country as a dumping ground, absorbing our cash. What is especially terrible is the large-scale import of agricultural products, which fiercely broke our "agricultural-based" camp, causing 70% of our country's farmers to become displaced. In addition, the two floods have made it impossible for them to cultivate the land. At the same time, urban industry and commerce are also teetering on the brink of collapse due to the general decline in purchasing power. Recently, in Shanghai, known as the "Paris of the East," more than 500 large stores have received "sealing" warnings. The danger in the mainland continues to increase. The number of unemployed people is increasing year by year, day by day. Under this current situation, the waste of time and manpower, if quantified with specific numbers, is an astonishing amount! Based on the current situation described above, those who qualify as bourgeoisie, seeing the bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of industry and commerce, dare not invest in these areas and take a desperate gamble. So, the only outlet is "banks." They themselves are even more happy to spend their days at dance halls and cafes to enjoy their remaining years. And those women with some beauty have no choice but to offer their bodies, hoping to get some leftovers and maintain their daily lives.</p>
<p>Repeatedly tolerating and ignoring, there will inevitably be a day of total collapse, which will be uncontrollable!</p>
<p>However, to seek salvation, one must start from the root and quickly eliminate this terrible and huge "waste." Empty talk of "relief" is of no use.</p>

<p>—Man Zhi</p>
<p>The set for the second act really looked like the addiction of a noble family. When the curtain opened, the nanny was standing at the door, and another person inside the door was talking to her, it turned out that her husband, who worked in a factory, had come to tell her that their child was seriously ill, and the two cried and mourned. ("The one inside the door is Ling He himself," Boer said, "The couple is acting in their own play." We all laughed. Of course, quietly.) The sound of the concubine's high heels startled them, and the concubine scolded the nanny for standing with the young master in the wind at the door for a while. The nanny knelt down and asked to go home to see her child, and the concubine scolded her loudly, and as a result dropped two silver dollars and told her to ask someone to take them home to hire a doctor, which was considered a great act of kindness. The concubine wanted to hold the young master herself, and the nanny went inside. (That young master was fake, the nanny dropped him to the concubine as if dropping something, which was certainly unreasonable. I said, "It would be better to have Ling He's wife's own child on stage," Boer said, "That's not good, if you want him to cry he won't cry, if you don't want him to cry he'll cry anyway, that would be troublesome,") The master came on stage and was very happy with the child. The concubine asked him what reward he would give (actually, Secretary Xu gave birth to him!). The master was so happy that he gave her a bankbook with 15,000 yuan. She picked up the child and went upstairs and was very affectionate with the master. Unexpectedly, the child cried, and the nanny came on stage when she heard the sound to pick up the young master, just as the concubine was being affectionate with the master, and was ordered to retreat by the concubine. The nanny went down, the sound of leather shoes, Secretary Xu came in, the master was being pressed by the arrival of a bank president, Liu Tiesheng, to rescue him. The car horn outside called, thinking that Liu Tiesheng had come, but the young lady came in. The master asked the young lady about Mr. Liu, and the young lady said she didn't know. The master questioned her, but the young lady refused to marry the old man Liu Tiesheng, and persuaded her in various ways. The master said that the secretary persuaded her, and the concubine also helped. Finally, the young lady was willing, but she wanted freedom. She said, "As long as he can satisfy my material needs, does it matter who I marry?" The car horn outside called again, and the master thought that Liu Tiesheng had come, but it was the first wife. The wife sat down, and the concubine gave way. The wife recited the mahjong sutra, which really pissed off the master, but he couldn't say anything. (This insertion, the performance is迫眞, the audience in the audience were satisfied, and I was one of the cheerleaders.) The wife went inside, and after not much talk, the car horn outside called again. Everyone thought that Liu Tiesheng had really come this time, but a creditor, Liu Jingfu, came—because he didn't have cash, he persuaded his daughter to marry Liu Tiesheng and wanted to borrow cash from him, but unexpectedly Liu Tiesheng didn't come, but such a debt collector came, which made the master really difficult to deal with. After reluctantly agreeing to pay the debt the day after tomorrow, he sent Liu Jingfu out the door. Liu Tiesheng called and said that all the property must be mortgaged, but there was no way, so the master had to agree. But unfortunately, after the news of the factory strike was reported by the driver Axiang, Secretary Xu quickly went out to deal with it, leaving the master stunned! End of Act Two.</p>
<p>This act can be said to be the most exciting. The plot is tense and interesting, and the actors performed vividly and vividly. The concubine was allocated points, and the rest of the actors worked hard and got benefits. The success of Miss Zhou Dao was praised by the audience.</p>
<p>The setting for the third act was still the first act's setting. As soon as the curtain opened, the nanny and Wang Ma were discussing the bankruptcy of the Zhou Mansion. The nanny made a few complaints about the wicked getting their due. (Wang Ma's performance was just right, Lao Huang said, "This child will definitely be remarkable in the future!") The master came on stage, and when the people retreated, the master was anxiously asking why Liu Tiesheng had not come to send the money that he had promised to send at this time. The young lady came out to report that the concubine had run away with the money. The young lady advocated reporting to the Public Security Bureau's patrol room to pursue and arrest her. The master said, "Don't make it public, so that writers can write novels and playwrights can write dramas, then I won't be happy." Unexpectedly, misfortunes never come singly. The factory called and said that the workers had destroyed the factory, and Secretary Xu had escaped with the concubine and was not responsible, which made the master so angry that he fainted. The wife heard about it and came out to question him, her kind of female perspective was annoying. Just as the master was distressed, the debt collector Liu Jingfu came uninvited! The master ordered the young lady to rush to Liu Tiesheng's place to urge him to send the money, and flew into a rage at the debt collector, but the phone called and said that Liu Tiesheng, the financial tycoon, had failed in the spot gold transaction this morning and committed suicide, which made the master faint. (The play ends.)</p>
<p>The actors in this play are hard-working and successful, but the ending of the script, such as the ending of the last act, is a novel ending rather than a theatrical ending, which seems to be slightly flawed, and Shakespeare's soliloquies also do not seem to be very good. I wonder what Mr. Ling He himself thinks?</p>
<p>(The manuscript published yesterday made a mistake about the ending of the first act. That was the ending of the second act, and at that time, it was just the master and Secretary Xu talking, and then the master went in to answer the phone, and Secretary Xu and the concubine were teasing each other before the curtain fell.)</p>
<h3 id="e246">Sister-in-law and Little Sister <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiong</p>
<p>According to the traditional explanation, the so-called "little sister" is what all wives call their husband's younger sister within a family.</p>
<p>In the past, when we lived in old families, we often saw and heard many unfortunate things arise from the mouths of the little sisters! That is to say, in a family, the happiness or unhappiness of the wife depended on the tongue of the little sister. If the wife was cunning and skillful enough to use many strategies to win the little sister's favor, then she would certainly gain some benefits. That is to say, at least, the wife would not suffer too much abuse from her parents-in-law, or be beaten and scolded by her husband. Her status would also be somewhat elevated. Therefore, from this perspective, it is so difficult for wives in the past and those still living in old families, as difficult as ascending to heaven!</p>
<p>I remember an old saying: "The elder sister-in-law's cunning, the little sister-in-law's strangeness." The so-called elder sister-in-law refers to the husband's older sister; the so-called little sister-in-law refers to the husband's younger sister. Both have a high position in the family. How terrifying and sinful they are to the wife! In terms of humanity, how cruel is this!</p>
<p>Women are already in an extremely painful and pitiful position in society! For thousands of years, they have been accustomed to the oppression of feudal customs; traditional ideas do not give them any freedom; various unequal and cruel treatments are enough to make them feel heartbroken! Who would have thought that in addition to the various social systems that strike and exploit them, there is also this unexpected, same-kind mutual killing and jealousy, the so-called little sisters. How unfortunate are those who are wives!</p>
<p>With the eastward spread of European trends, after the Industrial Revolution, the alarm bell of French women was broken, and they automatically stood up to demand their status and human rights in society. As a result, Chinese women also gradually responded. Since the "May Fourth Movement," they have also automatically demanded liberation and have risen up to fight against the old society in various ways. The old Chinese family system is also gradually collapsing with the torrent of the times. The little sister system has also declined as a result. This is an undeniable fact! It is also a new phenomenon that we should be grateful for. Therefore, all social phenomena are giving rise to new reflections. In addition to looking forward to the future of women with optimism, we should also work together to promote it and rapidly move it forward. Originally, in any family, let's take the old-fashioned family as an example, most couples still have passionate love for each other, but due to the oppression of that kind of bad and feudal environment, they dare not express it outwardly. Even if they love each other, they cannot show it on their faces! The little sister's harsh and painful treatment, like jealousy and cruelty, drives the parents-in-law and husband to beat and scold out of helplessness and innocence, causing discord in the family, often leading the wife to suicide and extreme pain! In the old-style family, the little sister system is simply an extremely sinful system! It acts as the fuse for family discord.</p>
<p>Although new families are increasingly flourishing now, all old systems are gradually being shattered and dying. In the new family, the unit is purely based on husband and wife. Pure emotions are used to supervise and help each other, so that social undertakings can develop and succeed. What a happy thing this is! However, in present-day China, the remnants of feudal thinking are still very strong. We only need to open our eyes and see, especially in rural areas, how prosperous and lingering the so-called little sister system is! Don't we see in the newspapers every day that a child bride in a certain place was beaten to death by her parents-in-law, and that a certain woman was abandoned by her husband, leading to suicide? Therefore, to say that the Chinese little sister system has completely declined is not true! In the old-style family, the cause of general discord cannot but be attributed to the trouble caused by the little sister's tongue. This is what I dare to assert, and it is a common social phenomenon.</p>
<p>If we pay attention now, not only in rural areas but also in cities, we often see such unfortunate phenomena. To be honest, in a society like China, everything is chaotic, a hemiplegic morbid phenomenon. The remnants of feudalism are still deeply buried in our minds. If we want to completely destroy and annihilate all old systems, we must first make an effort to thoroughly overthrow the entire system before rebuilding and compensating it!</p>

<h3 id="e247">Bearing Insult and Swallowing Anger <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Editor,</p>
<p>I am a very young woman. I didn't continue to study after graduating from elementary school.</p>
<p>In 1930, when I was just over ten years old, I was married to a middle-aged man I didn't know, according to my parents' wishes. Since marriage, there has been no emotion between husband and wife, but he relies on his relatives working in politics and often bullies me. I just bear the insult and swallow my anger. Last year, because of a trivial matter, he even acted barbarously and beat me. The day after he beat me, he sent me to another place. There has been no news from him since then (the above is just a rough description of the situation).</p>
<p>I really don't want to endure this kind of pain anymore. I have asked his relatives to divorce him, but his relatives replied that since I have entered his family, no matter what, I will never be allowed any freedom.</p>
<p>I have thought about hiring a lawyer to resolve the matter or filing a lawsuit in court, but because I have no money and no relatives or friends here, how can I do it!</p>
<p>I can only ask you, sir, to give me a complete solution to save me from this pit of fire. I wish you good spirits!</p>
<p>Miao Dingzhen, late at night on the 23rd of March</p>
<p>Answer: The editor has repeatedly said that marriage should be based on love, and divorce is possible when love breaks down. However, in the current society, it is impossible to achieve this ideal. The reasons have been discussed in this mailbox before, under the title "Why is Divorce Difficult?" I won't go into detail here. In Miao's case, she should get a divorce in theory, but she cannot get a divorce under current law. Therefore, it seems that she can only continue to endure "this kind of pain that I really don't want to endure anymore." There is no fundamental solution. However, although there is no fundamental solution, the editor has thought of a remedy that may alleviate the pain somewhat.</p>
<p>We believe that the biggest reason why husbands or their families in the current society can "bully" their wives or daughters-in-law, and the wives have to "bear the insult and swallow their anger," is that the wives have to rely on their husbands to live and cannot be economically independent. If they can be economically independent, "this kind of pain" may not happen. Therefore, we believe that the best way for Ms. Miao now is to find a job as soon as possible. Don't dislike the job being small, the pay being low, or being too hard, etc. If you have a job and can be economically independent, "he" will no longer be able to "bully" you. Even if he comes to "bully" you, you don't have to "bear the insult and swallow your anger" anymore. You can fight back. If he is really unreasonable, you have money to hire a lawyer to sue him, so you won't "have no money" and cannot file a lawsuit in court.</p>
<p>As for what his relatives said to you, it is completely nonsense. Freedom is our right, who can restrict it! Therefore, if they don't allow you to find a job and become independent, you must not give in at all. You must resist them as much as possible and fight for the freedom to "find a job" and "be economically independent."</p>
<p>In short, in this day and age, you will encounter difficulties everywhere. We rarely have "perfect plans" or "smooth sailing" in doing things. Therefore, we must use the spirit of burning our boats and breaking our cauldrons to solve difficulties in everything we do. Whether you can avoid being subdued by them depends on whether you have such a spirit.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>At dusk, a gust of wind suddenly swept in from the window, carrying sand and dust; it was almost unbelievable that it was the middle of March when I was still feeling hot in my lined jacket at noon. I was busy closing the window, and several sets of papers had already been blown to the center of the floor. These were originally to be returned to the students on Thursday. My temperament has never been to finish the things I have to do early, and I won't move a finger until I'm forced to, so this temperament is famous among my friends as a "lazy bug." The weather was so good today, I haven't had weather this good since winter, and instead it made me feel an inexplicable oppression. My colleagues invited me to tour the lake in the afternoon, but I didn't seem to be able to muster any enthusiasm, so I declined and slept through the afternoon alone. I still felt unwell all over when I woke up, so I wandered aimlessly around the campus. This spring in March, the flowers, trees, butterflies, and even the ponds, were all full of active vitality, but this extraordinary change in the climate didn't seem suitable for me. The peach tree in full bloom by the corner of the wall, which had just been flattering the spring breeze like a prostitute, was probably now hanging full of tears, mourning its miserable fate! Because the glass window in front of my desk was already covered with raindrops; I couldn't see the petals falling down, they had already followed the flowing water in the pond and disappeared! Spring, your momentary prosperity doesn't have the lingering desolation that winter leaves behind. Like an old man, I wandered back to my bedroom with a heart full of melancholy, as if I had lost something lovely that I couldn't remember, so I helplessly used grading papers to dispel my full of worries. This sudden gust of wind and heavy rain suddenly lowered the temperature, and I felt a little more refreshed in my heart. I changed into the cotton robe on the hanger, sat quietly, and lit a cigarette. The rain outside the window was getting heavier and heavier.</p>
<p>The sky was also gradually darkening, so I simply closed my eyes. Sitting alone and listening to the sound of the rain has a different kind of flavor in my heart. I didn't even notice that the cigarette was burning my fingers, and my heart seemed to melt into this quiet dusk. I don't know how long it had been, but I seemed to be drowsily hypnotized by the music-like sound of the rain. The tea servant pushed the door open and said,</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhu, there is a female guest."</p>
<p>I hesitated and turned around, trying to think within a second if there were any female guests visiting me in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>——Last winter, I was forced by a friend to get on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train and come here to work as an English teacher for twelve hours a week. At that time, I was recuperating in Shanghai, so although I was forced by a friend, it was also half voluntary. Changing an environment may change my mood; besides, the West Lake, with its beautiful lake and mountain scenery, is such a beautiful sanatorium! For several months, I have been happily searching for plum blossoms in the snow, exploring secluded places, and climbing to high places. All my troubles and pain have been wiped away, and I have the idea of ​​being happy here and not thinking about Shu, and growing old in this village. Although in the bright spring when red men and green women come together, I instead feel disgusted with the beautiful environment that can be agreed upon at West Lake - this may be a major reason why I often scratch my head - but after I came here - apart from my friends, I haven't notified anyone, and I don't want to tell anyone, in this instant, the female guest's slender figure had already jumped into the room in big strides. I couldn't recognize her face against the light.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Hollywood, Where is Your Heart? Former Stars, Today's Extras <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Xifu</p>
<p>Perhaps Hollywood is heartless. That extra, wearing a groom's leather waistcoat, pulled a tall black horse, quietly waiting for Jeni Nono to ride. This was a scene in "Little Sister" (PADDY ENEXT BEST THING). The director was in charge of everything, and he didn't even know who that groom extra was. Let me tell you, he used to be a star, but now he is forced by hunger and cold and has had to condescend to work as an extra at Fox Studios. His face was full of the haggardness of the road, and his eyes were full of sadness. All kinds of misfortunes and disappointments have left indelible scars on his once cheerful face. They were scars that no makeup could cover and no lighting could hide. He was just an extra, and he deeply understood that he had to try his best to do it well, to bring out the best spirit in his small role. He got three days of work on a film, and he was already tearfully grateful to the company for helping him like this!</p>
<p>But only three years ago, not too long ago, he earned a salary of $2,500 a week; he was still a star of great hope. His name was Pat O'Malley (PAT O'MALLEY), and he had made "GO AND GET LT" and a dozen other sensational films. But now three days of temporary work is probably his first job in weeks, months, or even years. He earned a few dollars, maybe he can pay the grocery bill, maybe the kids are waiting to buy shoes, maybe there's no money for the bus in his pocket.</p>
<p>Where did O'Malley's misfortune come from? Not from drinking. Not for women. Not for nightlife. Not for lack of ability. What for? First, the stock market. Almost all of his property was wiped out. Later, he bought an oil field from a big shot, but that oil field didn't produce oil at all. So he bought a piece of barren land, and his last 30,000 dollars were also sunk in the water. All he got was a receipt for $30,000, which is still in the hands of the lawyer. Now he has an old wife and three children. His house is mortgaged for six thousand dollars, but the mortgage will soon expire, and if he doesn't make any money, the house will belong to the creditor. In the past, six thousand dollars was nothing, he didn't know how many six thousand dollars he had spent helping friends and relatives, but now... things are different... he has been abandoned by the film company and all his friends. The friends who had benefited from him in the past are now avoiding him... Sometimes he calls them, and they don't even answer the phone. The world is cold, and human relationships are fickle, causing one to sigh! I don't know how long it took, but he still braced himself and refused to show his difficulties to others. He refused to be a small actor, he wanted to find a leading role to do, but the opportunity would never grace the door of this disgraced person. He would never discuss it with the company's personnel team, because he felt that he had his record, his talent, and should never ask for pity because of his misfortune. He also knew that a person who had been a star could never be an extra again, and once he became an extra, it would be difficult to become a leading actor again. But hunger overcomes everything. O'Malley couldn't let his family's empty stomachs fight against hungry wolves. So he went to various film companies. He had no car, so he had to take the streetcar, and sometimes he had to walk to save a few cents. He also met several former stars who were also walking around various companies looking for odd jobs. He found a small job in "Little Sister". He was very grateful. He said: "I must start over again. It is very difficult to swallow my pride, but I swallowed my pride." Alas, Hollywood, where is your heart?</p>
<h3 id="e250">Audience Opinions on "Spring Dreams in the Dance Hall" <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Thin Man</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, only this kind of film can exist, depicting some unimportant aspects of society in a light tone, with joys and sorrows, winning some people's sadness and admiration, although it also exposes some painful aspects of life in the current society, but that is just an unimportant depiction.</p>
<p>Speaking only within this scope, then this film cannot but be said to be quite successful. In terms of technology and photography, it has very beautiful achievements, especially the structure of the whole play is extremely ingenious and compact. For example, the manager of the dance hall, Chen Xiuwen, Cai Xiaofeng's cousin, and Zhao Yuquan, Zhang Zhi, etc., all appear once in the front of the play, and then reappear in important places, so that people do not feel abrupt, are reasonable, and quite in line with the ideal of reality. In addition, in the transitions and contacts of the plot, it can also be united by extremely economical means without feeling redundant, which is very commendable. However, there are also times when it inevitably falls into the old technique of deliberately setting up clues in the past in order to match the plot before and after, such as the breaking of the photo of Cai Xiaofeng and Li Manman, and Li Manman saying that the two words "dance girl" will bury my life, in order to respond to the fact that Cai and Li will not be able to get a complete union in the future. This is simply the echo method commonly used in sales novels, and the method is too old. I am a little dissatisfied with this point.</p>
<p>In terms of actor performance, everyone has average achievements. When Li Manman left Cai Xiaofeng and went back to being a dance girl, she stroked Cai Xiaofeng while at the same time having to be a dance girl for money, and the dance hall manager was waiting anxiously outside. The tragic scene was fully expressed on her face. We can see how intense her inner conflict was. This is the best section of performance in the whole play.</p>
<p>In short, viewed as a whole, this film has considerable achievements. But after watching it, we can't help but have a sense of emptiness, that is, the content of this film is too bland. Although it also depicts some of the sufferings of life, it is not the closest to reality, the most important, but just some unimportant depictions. It cannot give us a more enthusiastic and fresher stimulus. This is the biggest regret. However, under the current situation, only this kind of seed can exist!</p>
<p>For money, you have to be a dance girl, and for money, you have to be a dance girl again. Money overwhelms everything and destroys everything. The union of Cai and Li had to be sacrificed for money in the end. The material relationship in the current society is so cruelly hitting everyone. This should be the most important hint in this film. However, this hint is outside the scope.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Review of "Spring Dreams in the Dance Hall" <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Green Meaning</p>
<p>"Spring Dreams in the Dance Hall" is to depict the pain and social neglect of "dance girls." Manman in this film is a model among ordinary dance girls. Look, although she was forced by the environment to become a dance girl, she is always thinking about breaking free from these shackles and living a "human" life. After meeting Cai Xiaofeng, how does she always love him loyally - although the depiction is a bit exaggerated - but no matter how upward her heart is and how enthusiastic her love is, the treatment she receives from the environment is still very cold. She is regarded by Xiaofeng's father as an insult to the family, and she cannot escape the insults of the playboys. It is society that decides her fate, and it is society that decides the fate of ordinary weak women.</p>
<p>It is indeed worthy of praise that the playwright can extract this realistic theme and put it on the screen, but in the ending, when Xiaofeng brought his cousin to the prison to return her three hundred dollars, it seems that even if the playwright did not intend to distort it, he did not understand it enough. Since Manman has been given a sympathetic description in the front, then this ending is simply an insult to her. This ending is tantamount to telling us that Xiaofeng is aware (?) and has listened to his father's teachings and is united with his cousin. Here we must not forget that Xiaofeng's father is a representative of feudal traditional concepts, so the author is suspected of preaching for feudalism. The performance is a plain narration according to the development of the story, without special highlights or faults. But I always feel that it is superfluous to use a sign to imply before the tragedy happens and to use a few jokes for fun. The reason is that the former is close to superstition, and the latter destroys the plot.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that there are too many subtitles and too long dialogues. Subtitles such as "The Beginning of Cohabitation" are unnecessary.</p>
<p>"Rasputin" Factual Distortion</p>
<h3 id="e252">MGM Sued Story <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang You</p>
<p>Readers will remember that in the summer of last year, Shanghai tried to transport two films of the same name, "Rasputin". One was produced by MGM in the United States, starring the Barrymore sisters and brothers. One was produced in Germany, starring Conrad Veidt. However, both films were banned by the authorities in the concession. The reason was that they were afraid of causing disputes among the white Russians in Shanghai. However, the German-made film was once moved to the Shanghai Theatre in the Chinese district, while the MGM film was never seen by us.</p>
<p>The contents of the two films are roughly the same, and the stories are all taken from the secrets of the Russian court during the European War, depicting the life story of the demon monk Rasputin.</p>
<p>Now, MGM was suddenly sued in London on the 27th of last month. The plaintiff was the niece of the late former Russian Emperor, the wife of Prince Yussupov, Princess Alexandra. The reason for the lawsuit is that in the "Rasputin" film, there is a Princess Natasa, which, according to the description, is undoubtedly a shadow of herself. The film said that she was seduced and raped by La and was his mistress. The Princess believed that it was of great importance to her reputation, so she sued the London Royal Court for defamation and demanded compensation of 400,000 yuan for damage to her reputation.</p>
<p>The case was heard by Justice Avery. At the hearing, the plaintiff testified that the clothes worn by Princess Na in the film were exactly the same as those she wore during the European War, but she had never met La. The defendant argued. Princess Na was entirely fictional, with no hidden meaning, and the film had not been shown since it was shown last June, and the content had been deleted. There was really no reason for complaint. After two hours of debate between the two sides, the result was that MGM was found guilty of defaming others, and Princess Yussupov was awarded compensation of 25,000 yuan. Justice Avery stated that it was most despicable to slander the chastity of a woman with a happy marriage.</p>

<p>The entire production work of the "Wind," directed and compiled by Wu Village of Lianhua No. 2 Factory, which is highly anticipated for public release, has been completely completed. Recently, Director Wu has been very busy, so busy that he has been neglecting sleep and food, because he has to write the instructions and make another precise cut to make the whole play coherent without a trace of slack. The night before, he wrote until dawn, and the next day at noon, he locked himself in the editing room to work. As a result, he was listless, and he dozed off for more than two hours, dreaming that he was carrying the "Wind" film to catch a train, and a gust of wind blew him into the clouds. So he rode the wind and walked, feeling like an immortal, laughing happily and waking up suddenly. Afterwards, he told his colleagues about the dream, and everyone who heard it congratulated him, because this was a very auspicious omen.</p>

<h3 id="e254">CATHERINE THE GREAT SCARLET EMPRESS (10) <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Su Mei</p>
<p>At this moment, the entire palace was in a state of stillness, the calm before the storm. However, alarming news was secretly spreading, and everyone was living in constant fear, anticipating the coming of a great disaster. The Empress was ill, and according to the imperial physicians, her end was near. The Grand Duke secretly smiled in his heart. The Empress, on the other hand, tossed and turned in bed day and night, cursing, "You evil gods, do you want to see me die! But I will not die, my life will be longer than yours!" Although she couldn't accept the doctors' prognosis, within the palace walls, there was already hidden fear all around... What was she afraid of? It was because in the near future, Russia would be ruled by a madman and his lover.</p>
<p>One day, Prime Minister Bestuzhev rushed into Catherine's bedroom and had a secret conversation with Catherine. Bestuzhev also brought a young military officer, whom Catherine did not recognize. He said, "This is Captain Volkov. When the time comes, he will lead the army in revolt. As for the government, I will take full responsibility." After a while, someone knocked on the door, and a high priest rushed in, earnestly pleading with Catherine, "The churches throughout the country implore you to adopt the Prime Minister's advice." Catherine looked at them one by one and asked, "What exactly do you want me to do?" Prime Minister Bestuzhev began by saying, "First, we need you to promise that... well... the Grand Duke, under no circumstances, can be allowed to become the tyrant of Russia." Catherine said, "Oh, so you want me to agree to have my husband put to death." She shook her head, her attitude very firm, and said, "That's not going to happen!" The Prime Minister continued, "If the Grand Duke is alive, the political strife will never end. In our long, dark Russia, even a mangy wolf knows how things will change in the future." Catherine said very solemnly, "The Grand Duke has not harmed me, how could I casually order his death?" The Prime Minister pleaded earnestly again, saying that the people of the whole country loved and supported her, and that as long as she gave the order, anything, no matter how difficult, could be accomplished. But, even at this time, when Catherine's attempts to seize power were almost complete, she was still unwilling to kill anyone—her husband, Grand Duke Peter. She said, "I have sworn to be loyal to Her Majesty the Empress and her legal heirs, how could I harm the Grand Duke!" After she finished speaking, she dismissed everyone.</p>
<p>Outside the door of Catherine's bedroom, she and Alexei met at the staircase. She greeted him kindly, but a sudden pain arose in her heart. She felt that she must find a way to punish this man who had deceived her. Alexei told Catherine that he had been sent abroad by the Empress and had just returned from Persia and India. She saw that he had a brand-new medal hanging on his chest, and she congratulated him, but as she was about to walk away, he stopped her. He told Catherine very sincerely, "Since I returned to the country, I have heard... now I know for sure... the Grand Duke has plans to drive you out of the palace, or perhaps... even worse, as soon as he has power in his hands!"
