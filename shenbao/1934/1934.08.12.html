<p>第一。應請諸君反躬自省。我今番暫别風雨飄零中之祖國。浮海作客。果爲求眞實學問而去。抑或爲「登龍」「鍍金」而去。如我之目的在於眞正求學。我便須及早抱定埋頭苦幹之意志。卽在舟車旅行期間。亦不可把光隂浪費。反之。如我之良心告我。謂我之意願只在出洋一轉。以喝海風爲炫耀鄕里之口實。則在自費諸君。不如改辦遊歷護照。省去報到入學等幾多麻煩。在官費諸君更不如不去。騰出空位。讓給心餘力絀之人。免得時後良心責備。分外難受。</p>
<p>如諸君之目的名爲求學。而實則僅在於得學位。則吾人敢安慰諸君。此去準可如願以償。惟諸君之目的。仍不免於似是而實非。吾人知歷屆出洋學生以畢業於國内大學者爲最多數。卽本屆亦然。是以敢假定諸君多爲上駟之材。以諸君之智力。另加相當之金錢與時間。則他日得一博士或碩士頭銜。必非難事。惟其然也。故所謂博士與碩士之眞價值。可得亦由是而見。諸君須知今日社會漸識眞才。求學貴重實際。若徒然以求一學位爲能事。平時勉强得一及格。最後亦不過任意搜羅若干參考書。斷章取義。堆砌成篇。甚或向中國古籍中之「九通」等書。截取片段。然後倩人捉刀。譯爲洋文。以期求售於彼邦之敎授。則不僅欺人。亦以自欺。願諸君此去。對於學位之觀念稍輕。將來所帶歸者。應爲附麗於手腦二者之眞本實力。不僅爲一紙羊皮文憑。幾行蟹字證書。「留得青山在。不怕没柴燒。」苟有眞本實力。縱無洋狀元洋翰林等空頭銜。遲早有人延聘。决不至於終身懷才不遇。不信請觀國内外之領袖人才。儘多「白丁」出身。何嘗不受時人之敬禮。</p>
<p>第二。諸君在留學期間。物質之享受。必較國内爲尤厚。海外繁華。引誘至多。青年子弟。苟不守身如玉。難免見獵心喜。小則荒怠學業。大則污辱國體。一念之差。終身遺憾。諸君身受高等敎育。尤應隨時隨地以中華民國之代表人物自負。若然。則過去東西洋留學界之齷齪。庶幾可以一掃而空。豈不大快。</p>
<p>第三。諸君以自費者多。平時養尊處優。席豐履厚。或鮮知一般國民之疾苦。此去離國日遠。印象益淡。留學期間。耳染目濡。莫非爲外邦景色。異國情調。居移氣。養移體。環境感化。每不自覺。吾人常見一留學生出國之頃。不過一二分洋氣。回國之頃。洋氣幾分。渾然莫辨。以其已全身化了。留學生受人詬病。此其主因。此弊如何可免。誠不容忽。吾人以爲一則在採他人之精萃。不採他人之外表皮毛。尤其是學他人之生産方法。不學他人之消費習慣。二則在認清自已是四萬萬中國人中之一份子。不僅是五六千留學生中之一份子。</p>
<p>歸納以言。吾人所望於諸君者。不過三事。（一）求實學。（二）敦品節。（三）防洋氣。凡此所述。雖卑之無甚高論。苟能一一履行。必將爲留學界放一空前異彩。其受益者豈僅諸君之本身而已。嗚呼。國難日亟。諸君須知今日之中國爲如何時。將來諸君所負之責任爲如何責任。苟念及此。能不惕然懼奮然勉哉。</p>

<p>一、日政府根據於日本退出國聯時、日皇所頒布詔書精神、强化日滿議定書之條件、盡力援助「滿洲國」獨立及其發達、</p>
<p>二、現行三位一體制、待應改革時期之到來、實行合理的改革、其方法、存置全權大使與關東軍司令官、作爲二位一體制、關東長官爲關東州内之行政長官由拓務省監督之、</p>
<p>三、「滿洲國」爲一獨立國、日本應派外務大臣監督之外交官、</p>

<p>（華盛頓）此間熟悉情形之觀察者預料、羅斯福總統將白銀收歸國有後、或將發起國際幣制會議、蓋羅氏向來贊成幣制穩定政策、現在當無所變更也、至財政當局則今日方忙於起草白銀國有後之各種規程、惟聞財部尚須覘各方反響如何、始能發表、總統與財長毛根韜已定於今日午後三時會議、所商者大概爲白銀問題、此間對於政府此舉究竟是否爲膨脹政策、仍莫衷一是、政府當局聲稱、此舉祗爲穩定金銀比價過程中之一階叚、然紐約華爾街人土則多以爲此係大規模膨脹政策之先聲、全國報紙大致表示贊成、惟紐約時報則謂目下爲時尚早、未能評其得失、觀察者以爲政府此舉並無所費、因政府不過將現銀收去、發出銀劵而已、惟財部如以所發銀劵之價值、定爲美金一元二角九分、則結果如何、尚不可言、再銀幣之價值亦可重定、凡此皆有膨脹傾向者也、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間人士對於羅斯福總統關於白銀國有命令之分量與結果、不願表示意見、惟一般人以爲銀塊在國際上市價、以後將惟美國政策之是視、此外金融市塲、咸研究美國收買白銀、究以美國境内爲限、抑將涉及外國市塲、據聞本星期自由市塲中已有六百萬盎斯、爲美國政府所購取、尚有其他數量、準備於下星期運往美國、按以前美國對於黃金、係先儘國内收買、以後則逐漸向外國市場購進、此次對於白銀或採同一步驟、亦不足爲奇、按昨日命令、國内收買期限、定爲三個月、則期滿之後、將漸及於國外市塲矣、此間人士以爲銀市之趨勢、大部分繫於美國收買數量之多寡、吾人深知美國所取之政策、結局必將收買極多之白銀、第儲銀之中國、可按現在市價、抛出其一部分之存銀而尚可得利、所不可知者、惟美國收買白銀、將以何種貨幣付價耳、以黃金收買、固爲中國所贊成、第欲美國抛出其一部分之存金、以收買白銀、恐甚難耳、在美國政策尚未明白顯露以前、金融市塲、頗傾於採取觀望態度、惟一般人仍以爲羅斯福之决定、乃表示美國在通貨膨脹途徑中又進一步、此種觀察是否正確、可暫不論也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>何炳賢金國實同一見解</p>
<p>申時社云、美實施白銀政策後、銀價節節高漲、影響我國金融實業、日趨嚴重、申時社記者、昨訪國際貿易局局長何炳賢、及銀行界金國寶等、分别叩詢意見、均認於我國出口貿易、勢必大遭打擊、兹特分誌如次、</p>

<p>據國際貿易局局長何炳賢氏談、最近美國提高銀價、致使我國白銀大量流出、以學理上論、現銀有鉅量流出、必致使金融紊亂、紙幣低落、幣制必蒙莫大影響、惟就現况以觀、將來是否有此危險、殊難預測、以美國白銀之提高、尚未到顯著影響我國之程度、但白銀提高、於我國對外貿易上、必有重大不利之處、此可斷定、因白銀價格未提高時、我國以現銀購買外貨、其價甚昂、外人以金購我國貨、其值甚廉、在北狀况之下、中國貨物輸出多而外貨輸入少、尚可有相當抵補、今白銀提高、因我國以高價之白銀、</p>

<p>購買貨價低廉之外貨、勢必輸入日益加增、外人以低價之黃金、購我價值高昻之國貨、勢必輸出日益减少、故我國對外貿易、與美國白銀提高政策、有極大之關係、</p>

<p>據經濟專家金國寶氏談、關於提高白銀價格、影響我國之利弊、我國經濟學者之意見紛歧、惟就個人觀察所得、覺銀價提高、與我國實有不利、蓋美國採取澎漲政策、收買世界各國現銀、據目前銀價、紐約市塲已高於中國、中國存銀勢必源源外流、結果定必引起中國之通貨緊縮、同時亦必影響於中國物價之低落、如此循環往復、中國農村經濟、必將有重大之紊亂、此外中國新興工業品、勢必受銀價提高關係、無法外銷、而外貨反可源源流進、有此情况、入超額定更形增加、白銀流出之數字、亦必隨之加增、故美國白銀政策如繼續施行、則我國金融與實業市塲、定感絶大之憂慮云、</p>

<p>此次民食設計委員會議所討論者、爲如何積極促進糧食統制委員會之成立、現在將從生産調查管理三方面着手、在該院統制委員會未成立前、所有猶查一事、工作繁冗、需時甚久、故將先由實業部農事調查所辦理、惟調查事宜、需費甚鉅、將來該項經費、究將如何籌劃、現在難於確定、</p>

<p>體育新聞日網球選手表演第一日</p>
<h3 id="c221">林寶華惜敗於太田 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>九比七六比四猛鬥連失兩盤</p>
<p>另一單打小鄭二對一勝渡邊</p>
<p>今日邱飛海出戰太田</p>
<p>日本前台杯選手太田所率領之網球隊、昨爲在滬表演之第一日、中外士女、因震於太田之名、前往觀賽者、竟盛極一時、約計有二千人之譜、法商總會上海草地網球會球塲、一時座無隙地、爲從來未有之盛况、共計表演單打二塲雙打一塲、主要之戰林寶華對太田、林苦苦奮鬥、以二對零失敗、九比七、六比四、鄭兆佳則以二對一勝渡邊、二比六、六比二、六比四、雙打卡爾生朋納費區勝渡邊小寺、六比四、五比二、因天黑收塲、今日下午三時半起、繼續作第二日表演、</p>
<h3 id="c222">鄭兆佳戰勝渡邊 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>渡邊聲勢實足渡邊爲去年日本之第十五名單打選手、球藝與鄭兆佳相彷彿、但其長力之不足、竟出人意料之外、抽球甚有勁力、上塲渡邊開球各勝一滑局後、渡邊憑有猛烈之左右對角抽、一連得勝四局之多、以五比一居先、兆佳屢試攔網、皆歸失敗、有時殺球過輕、有時擊出界外、迨第七局時、兆佳連連猛攻其反手、奪得一局、第一盤渡邊以六比二得勝</p>
<p>兆佳後來居上兆佳第一盤之敗、出球不穩、爲一敗因、第二盤起、渡邊又連勝二局、第二局經過若干次之平等、渡邊才勝、第三局渡邊開球、小鄭又猛向其反手攻擊、卒以滑局奪得、不料經此劇戰後、渡邊之精力、已竭盡于斯、從此一蹶不振、奔旣不能、拍又無力、一任小鄭擺佈、小鄭竟連勝六局、以六比二奪回第二盤、第三盤起、小鄭大意、岌岌甚危、以一比四落後、但加緊努力、又連得五局、以六比四再勝第三盤、</p>
<p>鄭兆佳二比六六比二六比四渡邊</p>
<h3 id="c223">林寳華敗於太田 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>太田球藝一斑今日吾人所見太田之球藝、恐已較三四年前爲减色、其擊法並不若何之動人觀感惟其穩健不失、爲所罕見、亦其得勝之原因、正手抽最爲有力、亦其拿手傑作、自始至終、作底線長抽、只僅上網一次耳、寶華昨日之網上表演、博得全塲之贊賞、常置太田於死地、發球亦得分不少、惜乎出球不穩、抽擊不如太田、以致自殺觸網累累、失分亦大部在上、其較太田、實相差並不遠也、</p>
<p>寳華二度佔先第一盤、太田於劇戰之後、才以九比七得勝、寶華於二比四、三比五時、竭力追上成五比五、於是以六比五七比六、超出太田二次但不幸仍爲太田連勝三局而敗、寳華開球先勝、太田發球亦勝、寳華之發球局、因發球雙錯誤二次、於是太田又以三比一佔先、第六局寳華曾上網攔殺、雖然成功、此局仍敗、林屢思上網、不可得、第九局以三比五落後時、林發球、以猛烈之發球獲一滑局、於是形勢頓然轉變、連得三局、以六比五反而居上、但次局又爲太田以滑局勝、寳華連發三球得分、又以七比六居上、但終以缺乏把握、爲太田連勝三局、七比九失敗、</p>
<p>太田穩健得勝第二盤林仍開球、又勝第一局、太田一轉身、又以三比一居先、第五局林開球、以重球得勝、其次一局、林乘機一舉上網、得告成功、遂成三三平手、但第七局林之發球局爲太田听勝、遂成四比三而五比三、勢已燎原、太田憑其穩健不失之擊法、以六比四再勝第二盤、</p>
<h3 id="c224">日雙打技術平平 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>最後一塲雙打表演、由卡爾邇朋納費區對渡邊小寺、技術並不高明、僅僅殺球兇狠而已、且天時已晚、草草了事、第一盤四比四後、卡朋連得二局、以六比四得勝、第二盤日人仍然不振、五比二卡朋佔先時、以天色已黑、遂告中止、</p>
<p>卡爾生六比四渡邊</p>
<p>朋納費區五比二小寺</p>

<p>— 白鵝</p>
<p>小朋友！我相信在地上或桌上你們一定擲過銅元或其他的東西，擲了以後，你們感到這東西怎樣，不是會跳起來的嗎？並且擲得愈重，就跳得愈高嗎？但是你可曾懷疑過：</p>
<p>「爲什麽會這樣」？</p>
<p>英國的牛頓對於這件事他曾起了懷疑，因懷疑他就發明了「反作用」的定律，就是說：銅元擲到桌子或地上的時候，桌子或地面會發出相等的力量，而方向是相反的。因爲發出的力量相等，所以擲得愈重銅元就跳得愈高，又因爲方向相反，所以銅元向下擲，跳起來是向上的。</p>
<p>小朋友！對於任何事情，我們都應該起着懷疑，你們應該問：「爲什麽會這樣」？我知道，這樣以後，你們的學問就會很快的進步，做牛頓，發明定律，並不是困難的一件事。</p>
<h3 id="c257">懶惰的錶 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 菊高</p>
<p>掛錶對手錶說：「我們永久不停地工作，未免太辛苦了，我現在想出一個方法，可以得到長期的休息」。手錶問道：「甚麽方法呢」？掛錶道：「從今天起，我們只要有時走得快，有時走得慢，主人見我們所指示的時間不準確，一定送到鐘錶店裏去修理，修好之後，我們依舊這樣，經過幾次的修理，主人還是得不到準確時間，那麽，主人就會灰心，給我們長期的休息哩」手錶道：「這辦法不甚妥當，指示準確的時間，是我們應有的職責，放棄職責玩忽職責的人，决不會有好的結果，我想」。</p>
<p>掛錶見手錶不贊成它提出的方法，暗暗笑它愚笨，膽怯，便獨自兒照此做去。果然主人把它送到鐘錶店裏修理，接連修了三四次，還是錯誤百出，和不修一樣，主人便把它丢在抽屜角裏。這時的掛錶，見達到了長期休息的目的，心中說不出的快樂。</p>
<p>那知事情出於掛錶的意外，它靜悄悄地，蟄居抽屜角裏，雖似乎很安逸，可是灰塵滿身，失去了固有的美觀；和它作伴的東西，又都是些廢物。它有些感到失望了，但更不幸的事接踵而至，主人把它送給鐘錶店裏的人，換一條新的錶帶，給手錶扣着，鐘錶店主見它機件都銹壞了，便把它卸開，利用它的零件，去補足别種錶的損壞，這掛錶結果四分五裂，祗剩了一個空的軀殼，深深地懊悔，可是已經不及了。</p>

<p>年老伯有四個孩子：春大姐，夏二哥，秒三妹和冬四弟：春和秋是兩個最和順又美麗的孩子，每一個人都喜歡伊倆，愛伊倆。但是夏二哥和冬四弟的個性，却和他姊姊不同，是兩個最劣等最頑皮的孩子。十足是壞小孩的典型。</p>
<p>冬四弟，臉老是隂沉得怕人，百草家的孩子，見了他就要逃走，膽小的都給他嚇死。據說他的兩個「傢伙」很利害；能彀打得一手少林拳。</p>
<p>夏二哥是個横暴的孩子，待人接物，没有一點禮節，人人見了就恨他，駡他。手下有食客數千，像蒼蠅，蚊子，細蔚，蜈蚣，蛇……全都是殘忍的惡漢，隂險的小人。</p>
<p>在這四個孩子中，夏二哥是個最兇暴，最殘酷的孩子：像今年又强佔「黃霉」的家，覇佔了「雨」老先生的職權，把田裏的水都曬乾了；害得農人們苦煞！</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們願意留存這兇暴殘酷的夏二哥麽？</p>

<p>— 伯眞</p>
<p>時鐘鐺鐺鐺的打了十二下，好像在說：「人們吃午飯的時候到了」。敏兒聽得時鐘打了十二下後，他心裏很快樂，因爲他的肚裏已咕咕的餓了一二小時了，便飛也似的跑到廚房裏去告訴他的母親：「媽媽！飯燒好了没有？現在已經十二點鐘哩」。他的母親說道：「燒好了你去把椅子排排好，桌子揩揩乾凈。我就把小菜盛出來了」。</p>
<p>敏兒就到外面排椅揩桌，忙個不了。</p>
<p>團團的一桌，坐着敏兒和他的父親母親，還有他的哥哥丨聰兒。</p>
<p>母親剛把一碗飯給敏兒，他接到了手，便一口一口很快的送進嘴裏去，也不去細細的咀嚼。</p>
<p>不料喉間作噎起來，他的母親便拍拍他的頭頂。他便覺得母親拍一下，作噎便好一些，果然拍了十多下，作噎便好了。他說：「母親是一個靈騐的醫生」。說得他的哥哥也笑了。</p>
<p>但是敏兒不知道爲什麽飯吃快便要作噎？便去問他的哥哥。</p>
<p>他的哥哥說：「凡是人的喉間有兩根管了，在前面的那一根呌做氣管，我們呼吸的新鮮空氣，從這一根通到肺裏去。在後面的那一根呌做食管，我們吃的食物，從這一根通到胃裏去。</p>
<p>那麽爲什麽飯吃快便要作噎？</p>
<p>我們吃下的飯，照例應當到食管裏去，但是吃得太快了，飯來不及到食管裏去，便誤入氣管了。</p>
<p>那時不要再嚥下飯去，等到飯從氣管裏回出來，仍舊到食管裏去，那時你的作噎便好了」。</p>
<p>於是敏兒每次在吃飯的時候，總要細細的咀嚼了。</p>

<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>小朋友們！在夏天下陣雨的時候，你們一定聽見空有轟隆隆的響聲，和閃閃爍爍的亮光。家長也許告訴你們過；「那是雷公和閃電娘娘在施法術，懲罰一切作惡的人」。你們切不可相信。要知道響聲基空氣震盪成功的，閃光是電的接觸所發生的。</p>
<p>雲裏面常常含着電氣，有的是陽電，有的是隂電。電的性質是同性相拒，異性相吸的。用絲綢擦玻璃棒，或用絨布擦電木棒，都能够發生電氣而能吸引輕物，如紙屑塵埃等，（圖一）將電木棒摩擦生隂電以後，用絲線縣空，同時把玻璃棒摩擦生陽電，移近電木棒，就能互相吸引。（圖二）倘若兩根電不棒，或兩根玻璃棒，就没有這種可能了。天空中含有異性電的雲，在半空中相近，就會互相吸引起來，但空氣是不容易傳電的東西，所以一定要有極大的電壓力，電流才能通過空氣。剛剛穿過空氣的時候，就發生無數的電火（圖三），同時空氣被電力擊破，急遽地震盪成巨響。這光呌做電，聲就是雷。像我們玩的呼呼板（圖四），拉得愈快，竹板震盪空氣愈烈，聲音就漸漸響起來。雷聲的成因也是一樣的。不過光走得快，每秒鐘約有三憶公尺的速度，而聲走得慢，每秒鐘僅能走三三一公尺，所以聲和光在半空中雖然是同時發生，而至我們面前時，却先看見電光，而後聽見雷聲了。</p>
<p>從一百八十餘年前，美國佛蘭克林（圖五）發明了雲中有電以後，雷電的原理已經證明得很透澈了。目下許多歐美的電力試騐室中而且有人在試騐人造雷電哩！所謂雷公擊人的話，實在是觸電的附會。這種放射的電，無論人畜，一觸即斃，房屋大樹，也往往遭觸電焚燬，所以近來高的房屋中有避電針的裝置，把異性的電吸引到地下去。（圖六）雷雨的時候，勿出外行走，勿着濕衣，勿靠着高牆大樹，就可避免觸電了。</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>夏季水果王的西瓜，在近代營養學上，究有多少價值呢？照有名醫學家雪泰大博士研究的結果，反肉内，含有水分九五·九六，含水炭素二·八七，蛋白質○·七八，灰分○·二○，脂肪○·一○，纖維○·○九，但是我們吃西瓜時，譬如爲紅心西瓜，吃盡紅的部分後，白的部分，因爲味淡，都棄而不食的。然而白色被棄部分的成分，與紅色部分，没有多大差異，不過灰分稍少，而蛋白質與脂肪比白色部分反多。又西瓜的含糖分量，爲六至八％，其三分之二爲果糖，共没有瓜子的中心部分，與周圍多瓜子的部分，以及去了外皮的内皮部等比較起來，中心部分，含有果糖葡萄糖蔗糖等爲最多，周圍部分次之，近外皮部分爲最少，所以甜味的厚薄，也逐層的不同了。至若西瓜中所含的維太命素，爲夏季水果中最多的東西，所以患慢性腎臟病的人，多吃西瓜，有利尿的特效。今年氣候奇熱，汽水冰凉清凉飲料瓜果等，銷路甚大，可知社會上吃的人很多，但是，貪顾一時的口腹，西瓜吃得太多，腹部就要膨脹，各種疾病，隨之而生，因爲西瓜是植物，很不容易消化，而且含蓄水分過多，對於胃腸腎臟，都有弊害的。（編者按）：小朋友們吃西瓜，不要把蟄吃下去，嚼了渣，立時吐出，那就没有不消化的弊害了</p>

<p>— 汪乾綽</p>
<p>小朋友！你能將一隻生的鷄蛋（鴨蛋也可以），不許將它損壞，可以豎在桌面上麽？或者你們竟以爲是不可能的吧？其實這並不難，你只要把鷄蛋握在手裏，輕輕的摇幾摇，然後把它慢慢的直立在平滑的桌面上，它就可以豎着了。</p>
<p>做這個游戲應注意的有幾點：（一）舉動須穩重不可性急；（二）須豎在平滑的桌面上；（三）若一時不能直立可將蛋多摇幾摇</p>
<p>最後，我要告訴你們蛋爲什麽會豎着的道理：蛋在未摇之前，它全體的重量，集在蛋的中心，所以能横放在桌上。當蛋摇過之後，它全體的重量漸集於蛋的一端，我們把這端直立在桌面上，當然也可以豎着了。</p>
<h3 id="c264">青魚和白魚 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>水裏的青魚，前後左右，總時常有許多白魚跟隨着不離，爲什麽這樣的親密？因爲白魚貪佔便宜，搶吃白食的緣故，青魚尋着自已到口食，常常吃不着。</p>
<p>不過小朋友對此要有疑問了，青魚覓食，白魚也會覓食，爲何白魚要搶青魚覓來的食呢？青魚已經覓着到口的食，爲何自已不吃下，反被白魚搶了去吃呢？這不是很特别嗎？</p>
<p>原來青魚喉部生有利齡，吃起東西很會咀嚼，它最喜歡吃的是螺螄，將螺螄在喉部嚼碎，隨又吐出口外來，使那些細硬壳下沉，再吃凈肉；那知白魚趁此機會，圖佔便宜，當螺螄肉在水中盪漾時，一擁而上，搶着吃了，青魚將要到口的食，却被吃白食的白魚享用，白魚只是没的牙齡，旣無法吃整個的螺螄，又嘗着螺螄肉的味美，總想乘機打刦，所以總是前後左右的跟着青魚。</p>
<p>一天，老漁翁在堤邊柳隂下之垂釣，一雙眼睛，凝視那釣綫上的標記，只要標記一動，就知道有魚上鈎，便卽提上，青魚和白魚恰游到釣鈎這裏來，釣鈎上穿着曲蟮的肉，白魚又照着搶螺螄肉的故態，急忙搶着，剛纔到口，綫隨提上，一個翻身轉，已到老漁翁魚籃裏來了，老漁翁再放下釣鈎，隨又釣得白魚，接連多次，都是如此，青魚因搶不着釣餌，終未上鈎，就摇摇擺擺的游到别的地方去，白魚還在魚籃裏挣扎，老漁翁笑着對白魚說：「你素來是愛貪便宜的，須知貪小便宜，終要吃着大虧，你這時覺悟了麽？但是懊悔已無及了。」</p>
<p>小朋友，人的行爲，要光明磊落，廉節自重，非本分所應得的，切勿貪圖那些不正當的便宜，貪圖小便宜，往往受大禍患。</p>

<p>— 永采</p>
<p>小朋友！你們覺得今年天氣炎熱嗎？我來敎你們做一具袪暑納凉的小玩意吧！不過，在你們將要動手做這小玩意之前，先要預備一些簡單的材料：丨丨八寸長五寸闊的木板一塊，空香烟罐二個，六寸長三四分厚闊的竹料四根，粗鉛絲十五寸，一寸半長的洋鐵管一段，（這段洋鐵管是這件小玩意中的一件重要材料，它的粗細，要比所備的粗鉛絲稍些粗一點，假使你不會做，可到洋鐵舖裏去做一段，三四個銅元就够了。）扁闊的帶子一條，丨丨以上的材料預備好了，我們就可開始動手做了。</p>
<p>開始動手做這件玩意的時候，我們可以把它分爲兩步工作，第一步是做機翼，第二步是做輪軸。</p>
<p>第一步工作：先將空香烟罐剪開來，照（圖一）的式樣尺寸丨丨密達尺丨剪就同樣的兩塊翼子，再在剩餘的洋鐵上，剪一塊銅元大小的洋鐵皮下來，剪好了，先將兩塊翼子十字交义在一處，翼子的中心點，拿釘子打一個眼，然後裝在洋鐵管的一端，務使它緊緊的一些兒多不活動，（最好呌洋鐵匠拿焊錫焊牢）洋鐵管的另一端，再拿那塊圓洋鐵同樣的打一個眼，緊緊的裝上去如圖一，裝好了剪一段二寸半長的粗鉛絲捎在洋鐵管的裏面，（注意：洋鉛管在鉛絲上要活絡自如）再拿所備的竹料，拿兩根在上端各鑽一個孔，拿鉛絲的兩端，就緊緊的捎在孔裏，如圖三，這樣，第一步工作就告成了。</p>
<p>第二步工作：拿兩個烟罐的蓋了，緊緊的合在一處，蓋子的中心，再打一個眼，拿剩餘的鉛絲，緊緊的捎進去，也要使它一些兒不活動，（最好也呌洋鐵匠拿焊錫焊牢），如圖四，捎好了再拿剩餘的兩根竹料上端同樣的鑽兩個孔，這兩個孔要鑽得大一點，使鉛絲捎在當中有活動的餘地，鑽好了，就拿鉛絲分途捎進去，捎好了就拿鉛絲再彎成一個摇手，如圖五，這樣，第二步工作也就告成了。</p>
<p>兩步工作都做好之後，就拿四根竹桿在木板上依着適當的地位和距離，釘在木板上，再拿那根扁闊的帶了，拴在洋鐵管和輪軸上，如圖六，這樣，全部的工程就告完竣。</p>
<p>玩法：每當你們温習功課或無事的時候，拿它放在身旁，輕輕摇動輪軸，四張翼子就會很快的轉動起來，同時又凉又大的風，就會襲面的來驅逐你身旁的暑氣，小朋友！你看這個玩意兒多麽有趣而合於實用啊。</p>

<p>這年頭女子似乎特别不爭氣，在這國將破，家將亡的時節，不出來幹一些有益於社會的事，反歡喜做洋奴，替外國貨做推銷員，且藉此裝得妖妖艶艶，誘惑異性，難怪那些憂國之士（？）看了這現狀，以爲國之亡，全在這些妖孽作祟，所以廣東首先發難，禁止男女同行同浴……，似乎有一舉掃清妖孽之勢。而各報紙更不惜紙張，大書特書化裝品進口幾何幾何，今年比去年增幾何，本月較上月增多少的記載。我們也承認我們的婦女界，實在太不爭氣了，但推源禍始，究也不能完全歸罪於女子。</p>
<p>我們知道中國的女子，自被三從四德的鐵鍊困縛以來，說不上自由，談不到意志。雖然近來似乎政治上敎育上經濟上，都得到了平等，但那些，只是幸運兒，才能偶而獲得的，大部分，不，該說全部，還是做着奴隸，當着商品；因其是奴隸，所以不得不聽主子的使喚以圖承歡，因其是商品，不得不裝煌點綴，以求銷售，這是奇裝異服之由來，也是化裝品能如此傾銷的理由。所以較爲根本的解决，還是應使女子個個都有平等獨立的地位，不必藉肉體來換得生活資料，在這原則下，第一社會不該再有奴化的敎育，第二社會應使女子能有眞正獨立的環境。</p>

<p>— 英</p>
<p>現在正是無數學校的招生廣告，佔滿着各報顯要地位的時候；也就是青年男女學子徘徊奔波，尋找升學門徑的當兒。另一面北平大學畢業生職業運動大同盟之成立，全國如響斯應，是十足地證明了學生的無出路，在這「學校多一畢業的學生，社會即增一失業的分子」的現社會下，其中失業最多的特别是女學生。蓋在此男性中心的社會裏，女子職業範圍本極狹窄，何况在這種大批的失業後備軍中，女子旣缺少爭奪飯碗的經騐，而又受着社會的另眼看待，自然求職是比登天還難的了。所以，現在僥倖得仰承祖澤，而能升學的女學生，爲着找尋將來出路的凖備計，對於這個嚴重問題，不得不更加注意了。</p>
<p>我覺得升學的女青年們應當細加考慮的，至少有兩點：一爲學校；二爲學科。</p>
<p>學校的選擇是升學者第一步的主要工作。選擇的方法，却不能單憑報紙上所載的廣告和章程，因爲現在，有些學校已經商業化了，他們的章程和廣千墌不免帶了買賣的欺騙性質。廣告上載着某是校長，某是董事長，無非拿着名人來做招摇撞騙的幌子罷了。所以，我們最好要在可靠的朋友和同學方面打聽探問，才可得到眞相。選擇學校的標凖，應注意的，（一）該校是公立的還是私立的，假使是私立的，那末，牠的基金如何？設備如何？以及敎員如何？都應加以考慮，據我們所知道的，公私學校的學費往往成反比的，經費充足的公立學校，學費必低，設備必優，因牠不是靠學生的學費來支持的。反之，不三不四的「野鷄」學校（大，中，小學都一樣），大半没有可靠的基金，所有敎員薪水，房租，設備及其他一切開支，都是「羊毛出在羊身上一由學生那裏「敲榨來的，因之私立學校的學費是很高的，而且不能不高的。同時此等學校多半是以營業爲目的，不會以高額薪金來聘請優良敎員的。（二）應注意的是該校在社會上的聲譽如何，及該校畢業生學識的一般水凖如何，這也很重要的，因聲譽好的學校當爲社會所推重，成績佳的學生當爲社會所需。（三）應注意的是該校以何科設備爲最優，是否與本人旨趣之所近，因爲環境適宜，能鼓起自已學習的興趣，這樣可收得「事半功倍」的效果。（四）女生應選擇男女同學的學校，因爲這樣才能養成社交公開，平等尊重的習慣，並且還可增加男女中間在學問上競爭的心理，不比有些女子的「專校」，把一切寶貴的光隂都化費在學習烹飪，縫袵，剌繡等功課上，而忽略了自然科學或社會科學的基本學識之修養。</p>
<p>至於選擇學科，我認爲應以本人所喜歡的科目中擇其重要的而學之，而且要兼顧到社會的需要，這裏就聯想到社會問題來了。</p>
<p>誰都知道社會問題是與我們有着最密切的關係，學習自然科學的一部分人往往忽視這個社會問題的。殊不知這些自然科學丨物理，化學，數學，天文，是與社會科學相聯繫，同時她的應用是需要社會的環境，至於社會科學丨如經濟是社會的基礎，而文學，敎育，法律，哲學，政治……則是社會組織的上層建設。我們如果要使所學的能合於實際；要正確地了解社會；要解决社會的困難，達到我們對於社會的期望，都要在升學的時候，下個决心作深刻的研究才行。</p>
<p>末了我們附帶談談關於最近有一部分人所提倡的女子應回到家庭去的「賢妻良母」敎育。我不知道這一部分人是否害怕職業競爭中增加了女性的生力軍，所以他們想把女子逐回家裏，過廚夫和女紅的生活，以使社會的一切都由男性來獨裁，如果是這樣不僅不能解决現社會的基本矛盾，而且使牠愈益加深。這無疑的是反時代的開倒車的辦法，這無異於十八世紀初工人暴動打毁機器的愚蠢行動。實際上，女子若單求些「賢妻良母」敎育，回到家裏去「侍夫順子」，按現在社會一般的情形，只有加重男子的負担，而切斷女子經濟獨立的道路，這祗有少數「有聞人」的奶奶太太們才爲適宜。關於這些我們以前所說的出嫁不是女子職業的文字中解釋得十分明白了。况且女子能升學的，能求職的爲數極少，要以這「鳳毛麟角」微而又微的數目，來補救現在大批的失業底中國社會，是辦不到的，同時我們决不願去過挪種桎梏的寄生的非人的生活，我們的「賢良」應該放在有益於社會的一切的事業上，這樣才能謀得女子的初步解放，這也是希望凖備升學的同學們應加注意的問題。</p>
<h3 id="c268">女敎員的話 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 碧梧</p>
<p>讀「離婚與敎育破産」後</p>
<p>一切的現象没有上軌道的今日，女敎員的生活，當然也常是不合理的。第一在性的方面，直到現在，除了極少數開明的人以外，還以爲女敎員該和傳道師姑一樣，保持聖女的生涯。結婚（指非父母之命，媒奺之言的婚姻）已被視爲褻瀆，離婚尤其悖謬；像本刊前期「離婚與敎育破産」所載，Ｈ城對於Ｃ女士，竟會有那樣的不經之談。敎育破産與離婚，固然有牠某種間接的關係；但意見不合的一人離婚，而便是敎育破産，這與「江水一落千丈」，「懸岩萬丈」，一樣不合常識。</p>
<p>敎育怎會破産？許多人歸咎於敎育者的「道德淪亡，廉恥道喪」；可是敎育者并非一律甄選出來的無廉人物，這解釋總太唯心。至於女敎員的結婚和離婚，而至視爲敎育破産的原素，這更是佛羅依德學說的末學膚受了。</p>
<p>依理想，敎育者卽使做不到偉大的人格，偉大的文化的創造者，也當做到此二者的搬運者。但實際，大家都和日賃工人一樣，搬運給下一代人物的，是零碎的磚瓦，是停止的機械，甚至是污穢的糞土！生活和制度，迫得他如此這般；佩斯達羅基復生，到這兒也挽救不了整個的破滅。</p>
<p>但，我們一切推諉於環境，又是無心負責之談。本身的健全，自已可以努力一半。一般敎育者的愚昧，淺見，偏狹，虚僞，……是不必一定依賴環境爲之改良：而這些自動的改良，在女敎員方面，或者有更多的需要。大抵女性因雌伏了千百年，一旦到了和男子平等的敎員地位，卽便躊躇滿志，不願多求。對學問知識，是以出母校之日爲絶對的畢業；對社會人生問題，又因襲着雌伏的精神，認爲不切要。日常所以支持而興奮的，是「出類拔羣」的自慰和自高；許多地方，不能不有孤高的裝作。前些時流行的獨身主義，原因雖然複雜，這裝作却是主要的一角。其影響，與封建的貞操觀念兩相結合，更鞏固了社會要求女敎員爲聖女的願望。於是而我們學生從女敎員身上，見不到人格影響的一絲尾巴骨，而但見了虚僞的皮毛。</p>
<p>有的一輩子裝作終身了的，有的到後來却不免變節。但她淺陋偏狹的知識，不能使她明白這是人性的當然，而出之以光明坦白；她對常人，尤其是對學生，只有出之以加度的虚僞。有一個唯美的故人，她常憤慨地說：「與其當女敎員不如當娼！」娼妓如何慘酷，她似乎没有知道：女敎員生活的無聊，她是透頂知道了的。</p>
<p>Ｈ城的Ｃ女士的離婚事件，只能在敎授戀愛與結婚的問題時，作爲實地研究的材料：若認爲性生活事對學生該諱莫如深，而把環境的，各自的所招致的敎育破産的狀况，不給深切的研究和反省，而輕輕地推在某一人的某一事上，這是男女敎育界丢人的說法。</p>
<p>不過，依情形，我女敎育界同人，對於僞虚的，故步自封的生活，是否能給與打破：對於人格的影響，和文化的搬運，是否能多盡一點心力，却是該有更强烈的自我批判。</p>

<p>我深信世上的眞理是要從實騐裏才能體會出來的。理論只管談得新奇奥妙，如果不是親身體騐來的，那難免是空想，是靠不住的。一定不會相信。反之，那是眞理，會使你相信的。不然，只是你太幼稚，不能够體騐到。</p>
<p>炎熱的暑假，熱的風吹得人懶洋洋地，什麽事也提不起精神做。但是也不能絶對閒坐而消此長夏。於是看小說便是惟一的解暑方法了。這兩天，正看着潘家洵譯的易卜生集。這本書在十餘年前初版時曾看過的。那時候我還是十七八歲的少女，剛從閉塞的環境中，新得到思想上解放。見着一個異性的人，總會低頭害羞的；還那裏有膽子去想一想兩性間的關係這一些子？何况那時候兩性社交公開初創，萬事諸須穩健，以免授人口實。我究竟是禮敎束縛下的産物，的以自然而然的趨冋於「唯靈」的崇高。我把兩性都當成是「人」，寫給友朋友的信是情書，寫給男朋友的信也是情書。我從來没想到男女間會有不相同的事發生的。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，我看了易卜生的娜拉，羣鬼，及海上夫人等，我把它們當做戲劇，故事看。我雖然懂得一點抽象的印象　知道女人不應該做男人的玩物，依靠男人生活；但是後來我做了男人的玩物和依靠男人生活而仍不自覺。至於什麽性的生活，性的衛生，性的病狀，這些事當我生了第三個小孩子的時候，還不曾完全明瞭。一直等到一個偶然的幸運，丨丨不錯，我可以說那是我的幸運丨丨把我從「丈夫」的手裏解放出來，到如今，我才眞正同情娜拉，哀梨姐，和阿爾文夫人；我才眞正了解「第一我是一個人。正同　你一樣。丨丨無論如何，我務必努力做一個人。」「完全自由！還是自已擔干係！不擔干係咧！有這麽一來，樣樣事都不同了。」</p>
<p>環境是怎樣虐待我！生活是怎樣磨難我！我在困苦的深溝中忍痛掙扎向前爬。然而我是完全的自由，我自已擔干係丨丨負起做人的責任。我覺得我是一個人，在努力做一個人，我心裏眞有說不出的愉快！回想從前做着愛情的迷夢，做着丈夫手裏的妻子，連穿衣吃飯都被他管理着。他說我又蠢又醜，不讓我負家庭的完全責任，不把家庭的經濟支配權給我；不得到我的同意買些裝飾品回來，呌我照他的意思打扮得美麗好看。而且他的性器官因爲他的過度手淫，變成病態，他也不明白告訴我丨丨我深信他是明白的。他的性生活是自私自利的。他不注意衛生，不誠意的節慾。他是荒淫無度，任性所爲的人。</p>
<p>迷信着「愛是至高無上的」「愛是無條件的」，這些男人用來騙女人的話，受着正義的批判，良心的譴責，是多麽可羞恥的呀！唉！直到如今，我回想起來，還害怕！還發抖！正和破六十年紀錄的高熱，曾經逼死了多少人，而我也幾乎，不曾熱死，一樣地令人吐舌。</p>
<p>親愛的朋友，你也同我一樣，嘗過拉娜，哀梨妲和阿爾文夫人或其他各種異同的奴隸，非人的生活的嗎？你也想嘗嘗「努力做個自由人，負起人的責任，」這種清凉解暑的味道嗎？這是苦口的良藥，會給你暫時痛苦。但是那會去掉你的病，等你清醒過來的時候，你會覺得舒服，愉快！那味道兒，像吃苦瓜，吃橄欖般，苦中，澀中自有那妙不可言的鮮味。</p>

<p>這是老友白薇君給我私人的信，因大半是對本刊的批評和建議，特刊此公諸讀者。</p>
<p>編者</p>
<p>兹九：</p>
<p>爲着想和你深談一次，百番數十次想去看你，月前拜了一次府，你又不在家。再想拜訪，又給拖延了。</p>
<p>你是個能幹傢伙，不辭勞苦地辦着許多事，我這没出息的東西和你比起來，眞使我會羞愧死去！所以聰明的你有早知之明，老早就和我斷絶了友情。</p>
<p>當丁玲飛上天的時候，我是在地獄裏輾轉哀呼透不出氣息；，當你步步高陞積極幹的時候，我雖是爬出了地獄之門，却已經爬不動了，目前我正是病痛如割心火燒喲。你我眞是「天上人間」，像摩不到青天一樣我是交不着你了。回憶往年我們同學同居，我替你買鮮花，替你佈置畫景，朝夕伴你繪畫，整天伴你逛井之頭的雪景，最後我勸你看戲曲……那些，都像「流水落花春去也。」只有那時青年熱血的友愛，和你一時的美麗一樣。常在我回憶的浪潮中，打動我五臟都酸酸楚楚。</p>
<p>十年的離别中，我雖然數度去看你，數次遇見你，你對我都是露骨的冷淡，好像我和你，不曾有過友情的那回事。</p>
<p>兹九，那是我底神經過敏麽？還是環境决定一你我，只能那樣呵？（中略）</p>
<p>今春在文化敎育館底客廳裏，你把晨報上對我中傷的消息提起來笑我，儼然那是像煞有介事的，儼然我是沉醉在幸福中。</p>
<p>那也無怪你，誰知道我底人格？誰證明我底實生活呢？如果有人知道我底人格，明瞭我堅苦悲痛的實生活，無論誰，縱不爲我流涙，也會爲我發出酸悲凄惻之感。（中略）</p>
<p>告訴你吧：丨丨十多年來，自從你們知道我那轟動的羅漫史以至今日，我没有享受過一月半月的人生樂事，只有比任何悲劇都深刻的凄慘生活，死死地咬住我不放罷了。</p>
<p>廢話說够了，言歸正題。</p>
<p>爲甚麽我要向你說這些廢話呢？我想揭開我們隔閡的重幕，袒開胸懷和你說點正經話。</p>
<p>前些日子你對我說：「我所以接受編婦女園地，是爲着給我們有個說話的地方」。對這個熱血只可消沉，女子要回到家庭去的年代，你爲着給我們有個說話的地方，才擔任這個編輯，你很對！</p>
<p>可是，你那園地裏，過去曾說了些甚麽？未來想說些甚麽？你整個的計劃是甚麽？婆婆媽媽的但說些婦女的常識麽？學究先生的弄些深奥的研究麽？立在超然的地位，平淡無味地汎論些婦女問題麽？朋友，别離開這個尖銳的社會，别離開這些尖銳的女性，你類似江湖的說書先生照舊說些故事罷了！</p>
<p>不錯，像碧雲君，碧梧君，碧遥君，也屢次是對着遺風惡俗，作過多少駡倒的名言。</p>
<p>但是，新興的惡風，腐化，頽廢，譬如她們拜金，吸血，狡詐，無情；她們妖精的外貌，狐狸的居心；她們不自振作，得過且過，高興做没有靈魂的肉菩薩；她們虚榮，偷懶，只求物質的滿足，甘願一生屈服在萬惡的男人面前：她們不自愛惜，任性奔放，和無限的異性，顚倒昏迷，過着墮落的亂交生活……這些當前的尖銳現象，你們有人出來抨擊討論過嗎？</p>
<p>繁華街心，滿街是外國材料的衣服架，嘴唇塗得吸血鬼一般紅，標榜她們吸血的心；戲院或遊玩塲裏，充滿了没有靈魂的肉塊，鄙惡的嘻笑使人作嘔，瘋狂的扭擺令人肉麻，像遊屍般走路，奢侈到極度；家庭大厦中，多是修容治艶，閒逸浪費的摩登婦女，她們旣不知自已對民族社會的任務，也不去料理家庭及小孩，唯麻將與電影能够消磨她們底光隂，京戲，跳舞，偷情，也是她們不可少的剌激。這種吸血，寄生的女人，你們曾大聲疾呼過，呌她們趕快起來做人，不然，就像驅殺蚊蠅一樣，將對她們實施驅除的辦法嗎？</p>
<p>中國都會的女子，大半是繁華，偷懶，無恥，不是在那裏做人。多少是使人看了要縐眉，噁心，啊，女人是妖精！（未完）</p>

<p>— 文娟</p>
<p>到這廠裏，今天恰巧一週年了，據說，從今天起要開夜班了，舅舅來呌我，要我立刻去吃晚飯，五點半一定要進廠做夜班。我就把正在洗的東西丢下，吃飯去了。</p>
<p>今夜有些吃不消。幾個月不做夜工現在一開，頭腦有些發暈似的。最討厭的是肚裏的四個月的孩子，在那裏作怪，溜上溜下動個不歇，坐的凳子也没有，這樣的立在機子旁邊整整十二個鐘點，那裏挨得下去呢！</p>
<p>張家姊姊，看我難受，要我先請一天假。可是，我仍然勉强支撑着，咬緊牙齒幹下去。</p>
<p>唉，眞吃不消！機子一下出毛病，一下出毛病，到後面剛剛把斷了的經草頭接好，前面的梭子又把印度綢打了一個洞，拆去一寸多，又接了二三十個頭。這樣一起一倒，肚子動得太難受了，腰也酸起來，脚象兩條棒一樣已經没有知覺。我很想，很想有一個床舖，讓我舒服地躺一下，一下，只要一下就够了。</p>
<p>兩點鐘了，我把機子一關，想在旁邊打盹了。眼睛剛剛合下，忽然，「嘩……」，我驚醒一看，原來是對面二號機恐怕自已打吨，這麽大聲怪呌，以興奮自已的精神，可是，我實在不能再支持了，頭像裂開似的。那麽緩慢遲笨的「特達特達」的馬達聲永遠機械地在我的腦子裏回響了。心像梭子般用極度的速力在胸口忙碌着，它幾乎要從嘴裏跳出來了。於是，嘔了，嘔得滿地都是飯。舅舅替我請假，呌我馬上回家休養，扶到廠門口，他進去了，他似乎在咕嚕着：「小姐做慣了！」唉，男人眞不了解女子的痛苦呀，連自已的舅舅也是這樣的。如果我即時有力氣，一定要回駡他一頓。路上又接連嘔了三次眞難受。</p>
<p>回到家裏，已經像垂死的我，種種思潮，却一起一伏地湧上我的腦際：如果永遠怎樣病下去，明天還能繼續我的工作嗎？不上工廠，生活怎樣解决呢？目前尚維持不下最低的生活，將來孩子姜下來時，這雙重的負担，如何擔當得起呢？我的心碎了！頭暈了！涙珠兒像泉水一樣地落下來了！天呀！悽慘的命運啊！</p>

<p>— 安夫</p>
<p>當我們在呱呱墮地的時候，天就給與我們以五官四肢，這就足以證明我們人類的來到這世界上，不是呌我們享福而來，是呌我們爲勞動而來的。旣是我們爲人的職務是爲勞動而來，那末，我們就應當認清了勞動的目標，辨明了是非善惡，用了我們全生命的力量，不灰心，也不中斷，努力的向前做去，這樣才有成功的一天啊！然而事實告訴我們，人類是有生命有情感的動物，所以環境與個性等等，都與人類有相當的關係；因此我們對於所從事的某一種勞動，等到時間一久，往往會發生一種反感，而産生出一種對於職業厭棄的心理或狀態。而這種心理或狀態的滋長，在無形之中最足以阻止勞動的前進，以致形成生産率的低减，而且這樣不但會使得雇用你的雇主方面，感到你辦事能力的墮落，就是從你本身着想，正也同樣的感到爲人的無聊與痛苦。</p>
<p>有什麽藥可以醫治或者消滅這種危險的病症呢？實在的，這種病症的發生，簡直可以說没有藥石可以醫治的；有之，要算興味這東西了。卡萊爾說：「我們最歡迎在工作時唱着歌的人。」許米也說：「凡人對於世上任何一物，常抱樂觀主義者，要勝過每年有千金收入的人。」這裏所謂唱着歌的人，抱樂觀主義的人，其實都是在勞動時内心充滿了興味的人呀！在這裏我們還可以隨便舉出一個人來做代表，譬如說斯密司（ＳydneySmithr７７０－１８４５）他是英國的牧師，同時也是個名著作家，但是他怎樣會成功的呢？我們可以看到他給女兒的信裏說：「我現在所處的地位，並不是當初我所選擇的，不過旣從事之後，那末也就安心的喜歡牠了；因爲這樣比了好自高而想厭棄職業的人，反要有丈夫氣得多。」這種對於選擇職業而没有一定的標準，並不是一件適當的事；不過能使勞動發生興味，這件事，倒確是值得我們效法的。同時他生平最喜歡說一叚Ｌetusglorifytheroom（讓我們光榮這間屋子）。他的意思就是爲人要摒棄黑暗而放進陽光；也就是說：在人生的勞動之中，應極力放棄枯燥無味的一頁，而應盡力提倡勞動之有興味的一面。這樣看來，斯密司之所以能成功，所以能享盛名、也是由勞動與興味相調和而産生的。</p>
<p>看到中國目前的一切，不論是國家，社會，或是個人的生活，一種不景氣的現象，幾乎到處可以見到。然而倘若大家能循着本分，不嘆氣，不皺眉，不消極的努力幹去，像用了汗血制來約束我們一樣，同時盡量的在勞動之中去找尋興味，來作我們奮鬥的原動力，這樣，不出十年，我相信那時的一切一定要比現在强。你只要看日本就是我們國家的好例子，斯密司和愛迪生是我們爲人的好榜樣。</p>
<p>總之，人生是應當勞動的，勞動而感到枯燥乏味，也是必然的趨勢；不過在看你能否從枯燥乏味的生活之中，找到興味這興奮劑而已。因爲只有枯燥中得來的興味，才是眞正的興味。牠將永遠的繼續下去，像你的生命一樣長；而牠對於我們人類的有利，那更是不可以拿言語或筆墨來形容的。</p>

<h3 id="c294">影評人 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 立人</p>
<p>電影批評在歐美雖早已普遍的流行過了，但牠在中國的被喚起廣大的注意却不能不說是一二八以後的事。一二八以後中國電影曾有過長足的進步，這是誰都看得見的。這多半要歸功於日本帝國主義大砲的賞賜；但電影批評家之努力帮助中國新生電影成長的功績却也不可埋没。電影批評本來是觀衆意見的記錄；以獲取利潤爲唯一目的的製片商自然不敢忽視這種可寶貴的意見而走入絶路。到今天，才子佳人的鴛鴦蝴蝶影片，飛行吐劍的武俠影片，已被廣大的觀衆所唾棄了；電影的使命已被認定是爭取廣大羣衆與民族的自由解放的武器，而不是專門供給有閒者的消遣的東西丨丨丨這種對電影的偉大功能的認識，無疑的是電影批評家的努力所促成的。</p>
<p>因爲電影批評爲廣大的觀衆所重視與歡迎，報紙爲了爭取牠的讀者，就不得不競出影刊，載影評了；由是某一部分有藝術修養與影藝認識的人，就以一個「影評人」的資格而出現而被重視了。這裏我想接着將他們的生活姿態大略的叙述一番。</p>
<p>首先我要提到的是他們在報館方面所能獲得的「稿酬」這件事。大概報館方面對於影評人有兩種致酬的方法：按字計算和按篇計算。按字計算，則每千字的酬金約略可分六個等級，卽每千字五元，四元，三元，二元，一元半，一元等六個等級。這數目相差不能不說是相當的太，其原因一大半是因爲報館方面電影廣告收入的不同，和經濟能力的不同；一小半却是有些報館對於較有地位的特約撰稿者和普通投稿者的致酬方法有歧異。例如某報對特約影稿每千字均致酬三元，對普通影稿每千字則僅致酬一元五角是。規模大一點的報館對有地位的特約影評人的酬勞大約每千字不會少過五元到四元之數；對普通影評人則每千字僅致酬三元，二元。（此處所指自然不是一家報館。）規模較次一點的報館，對特約影評人每千字若能致酬三元怕要算是最高額了；每千字致酬二元，一元半的也很普通，每千字僅致酬一元的也並非完全没有。</p>
<p>按篇計算，（此處專指對某一影片的「片評」而言）則影評人每觀一片所絞出的腦血最高的代價怕只有大洋三元，最少則不</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>會少過二元，也有每篇致酬二元五角的。還有，因本市各頭等戲院最低價目有一元，六角，五角的區别，報館方面對於那較多出看戲錢的影評人，又大致是肯多出幾角錢的酬勞的。</p>
<p>不管是按字計算酬金，或按篇計算酬金，看戲費用大概都是由影評人自已擔負的。不過，從來藝術家都是些躬朋友，影評人不幸也不乏這一流的人。他們在自已搯不出腰包的時候，免不得的也許要向報館方面或負責人方面預支若干看戲錢，甚至預支若干稿費的。但這種情形是很稀少，而不常見罷了。</p>
<p>現在我想說到普通一個影評人每月的可能的收入。這决定於稿酬數目的大小和他們的是否有充分時間寫作這兩點。稿費拿得太而寫作又多的。每月兩百元之數。並非完全是一個幻想；一百幾十元在這種人看來也並非全辦不到的事。我們知道，影評人除了寫「片評」之外，還要寫一些電影論文，雜感，檢討等影評文字及其姊妹藝術戲劇方面的劇評文字，有時甚至還要寫一些詩歌小說小品之類，在期刊上，報屁股上佔一席地，去分得人家一部分稿酬。這樣東拼西凑地綜合各方所得，他們絞腦汁的結果，有時也有頗爲可觀的。但這樣的人佔極少數。多數人每月僅三四十元，甚至有每月僅能獲得一二十元的。這大半是因爲他們出産少而報酬又低的緣故。</p>
<p>關於「片評」，我還想再說幾句。大致各報館對於影評人看戲的戲院的支配，是有固定和不固定的分别的。有指定某一人專看某一戲院的，有臨時决定而由電話分别通知各影評人的。至於各報影評人的數目，我也想提一提。大概各報館特約影評人的數目，普通多亦不過三五個人，再多也多不到那裏去丨丨雖然看來好像並不如此。</p>
<p>現在我想接着說一說這批影評人的來歷。他們多半是電影界，話劇界，文學界裏的人，間或也有少數文明戲派和鴛鴦蝴蝶派的分子側身其間。電影界裏曾有些收入不够甚至失業的從業員們，他們很有想從電影批評的園地裏來覓取他們的出路的；有時也不乏某些製片公司所僱用的宣傳員們和有關係的人們，出來寫一些自吹自捧的妙文的。話劇界文學界裏的這方面的批評家，因爲多半都有着較深刻的文學修養和較豐富的生活經騐，對於電影雖不必是百分之百的專門家，但他們對影藝的認識與熱誠的研究，作爲一個鑒賞的批評家，他們的對中國新生電影及觀衆所貢獻的寶貴的意見，是大可值得注意的。至於那些落後的專以贊美大腿酥胸等色情塲面爲務，以低級趣味爲第一義的軟性的文明戲派和鴛鴦蝴蝶派的影評人，他們是早已隨着才子佳人的戀愛影片，飛行吐劍的武俠影片的没落而没落了，早已爲廣大的進步的觀衆遺忘得一乾二凈了。例如最近軟性論者和電影的現實主義者間的論爭，他們就是失了觀衆的同情，没有得到人們的理睐的。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，我想提一提某一些影評人的新出路。寫影評到底是一件很辛苦的事，假如有更好的差事好斡時，某一部分影評人會降低自已的身分，而出賣自已的知識的。他們可能被某一家影片公司羅致以去，爲了交換報酬，他們可以在影評方面上下其手，且製造一些莫須有的消息，爲劣片吹噓，爲老板的利潤大賣其力。他們也許有個宣傳員的名義，也許僅是從老板那裏取得若干津貼。例如專門粗製濫造的某某影片公司就常幹這一類的收買登電影文字的無聊小報和常寫低級趣味文字無聊影評人的勾當。影評人又有被聘請去當電影刊物的編輯的，也有在革本些電影期刊上特約寫影稿的，甚至還有被影片公司聘請去當顧問的。（當顧問的在文學上的修養自然更充分。）</p>
<p>最後我想提一提影評人的苦處。靠文字生活是一種最清苦的生活，而寫影評我認爲是更清苦的一種生活。他們多數都没有維持生活以上的收入，而他們的付的代價却倍於他種文人。影評稿多半是「趕」出來或「逼」出來的。我們知道，各戲院三時開映，五時散塲，散塲後也們卽須摒除一切的去寫評稿；不管是怎樣一張劣片，不管你對該片有没有意見，你必須在八點鐘前後，凑千把幾百字送到編輯先生那裏去。不願意看或看了使人要打瞌睡的劣片，你不得不去看；不願意寫而寫來亦難寫得好的文字你不得不去寫。有一根莫大的鞭子抽打着你，你必須搜索枯腸，交出一篇文章來。常見一些影評人在長長的三四小時内還是望着一張白紙發呆，其文思鈍滯。宛如一個孕婦的難産。這種「逼」文的苦處，只有寫影評的過來人才懂得牠是什麽意義的。</p>

<p>— 湘君女士</p>
<p>柏拉圖說：無論如何困難，切不可向人乞憐，因爲乞憐中，已含有輕蔑的成分。因此我把自已的心壓成鋼鐵一樣，任勞怨，耐飢寒，隻身伶仃挣扎在悽風苦雨之下，忍受人間一切的災難。雖然涙浮在眼中亂轉，我却把它咽下喉頭，當作生命之苦汁的痛咽，從不曾向冷酷的人前泣訴！</p>
<p>可是，在這個畸形的社會裏，没有背景，没有靠山的一個窮女子，憑自已的勞力換取麵包，雖譬如生的是一副鐵骨，任人剥削，任人碎骨吸髓，但卽使這樣，衣食也不一定可以温飽，而且終於還免不掉失業的危險哩！啊，這眞不知是憑什麽人情組織成的社會啊？</p>
<p>我自失業以來，屈指兩年我了，一身飄零舉目茫茫，一想及孤苦而没有社會地位的人有求於人時所受的侮辱和傲慢，會把人的心靈整個陷入悽其頽唐中，生存的勇氣，也會因此而消沈下去。所以在這長期的失業中，我只關起亭子間的門，預備坐以待斃，悵望着春去夏來，時序怱怱的變換，惶惶然像一只陷入泥塘中的牛，輾轉於泥塘之中，兀自發怔！</p>
<p>清晨我從苦夢醒來，撫着遍體的鱗傷，過去悲慘的生活，比什麽都有力的投擲到心上。掙扎了這麽久的三十餘年之間，受盡了人間苛虐凌遲的我，究竟獲得了點什麽？連個人最底限度的生活都不能維持！唉！人事何堪設想？徒然覺得啼笑皆非！我便像一隻創傷而哀號的野獸，頽然而倒，再也没有動彈的餘力了！</p>
<p>這時我想像那末路文人投海時的情形，如朱湘衛延殘等絶望而决心沈下去的一刹那的情形，唉！這是向我作多大的誘惑啊！這樣，我總覺得比在冷酷的人前乞憐，來得强項而且悽壯罷。</p>
<p>可是賢明的讀者呵！我有一個白髮蕭蕭的親老，在故鄕的角落裏等待着我！她的可憐的晚景，使我不得不鼓起精神，暫做幾天人。啊，不想她的能力，竟那麽的大！</p>
<p>因了這層關係，迫得我寫這篇文字，想以我的勞力，向社會的慈善者，換取一杯，殘羹剩飯。我雖無一技之長，但不斷的勞動，是我過去生活之典型。十多年來，我幹過工廠女工家庭學校的敎師。現在凡是我能力所勝任的，不論什麽我都願意幹，只要有一個位置就是了。通訊處金神父路花園坊二十三號陳君轉。</p>

<h3 id="c296">「文學」讀法舉例 <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 小山</p>
<p>（一）怎樣讀小說？</p>
<p>因爲同是一篇文學作品，以其形式不同，或爲小說，或爲戲劇，自然其讀法不能一致的。但我們在此暫以小說爲代表，其他讓讀者就其特殊點自爲推度吧！</p>
<p>殷作楨先生在怎樣讀小說一文内，曾對讀「韋護」提出如下的幾條大網：（一）這部小說所述的故事；（二）主人公的思想它的轉變和發展過程）；（三）主人公的思想轉變的社會根據；（四）反映在這部小說裏的作者的意識；（五）這部小說所表現的是那個時代的社會生活形態，（六）形式技術有什麽特色？它屬於那個派别？這種形式技術和它的内容脈搏是否合致？這提綱我認爲是較正確的，不僅讀小說，也幾乎適用於一切形式的文學作品。從第二到第五四項，雖然不是每篇作品中都具備的條件，但總可在每篇作品中找到牠一部或全部的表現，這是無疑的。第一與第六是關於形式的問題。</p>
<p>我們對一篇作品必要履行以上的解剖方可說是科學的讀法。如果我們只做了第一步，只注意於作品中的情節，僅對事件有興趣，其他一切不問，那就是所謂「最低級的欣賞」。如果專注在玩味作品的文字，音調，結構，表現法上的美，其他一切不問，那就是玩弄文墨的舊文人的勾當。不是研究文學的科學方法。這以上兩種方法都是不够的。</p>
<p>祗有執行第二至第五任務的讀者，他才握住了問題的中心，這幾乎是一切文學作品中心的條件。</p>
<p>（二）怎樣執行以上的讀法？</p>
<p>我們熟記了以上的讀法自然還不能說問題就解决了，我們怎樣來執行這讀法呢？</p>
<p>大概牠的過程是如下的：</p>
<p>第一，將選定之作品儘可能快的先翻閱一遍，將全書的或全篇的大概的輪廊作一初步了解，找出篇中主要人物和故事的中心及發展綫索來。在這一階段中，大概用了眼睛就够了。</p>
<p>第二，在檢查故事中主人公的思想時，這就不僅用腦，同時更用手了。你應將主人公前後所說的話及他個人内心的思想，一一記出，互相比較，找出發展的路綫。這一部分工作，非常不容易做，有人讀水滸，將一百零八條好漢的面貌，一一畫出，費了許多工夫來比較，這是必要的，同時這裏不能有一點主觀的好惡。如果主人公的思想前後矛盾，如果不是作者爲了另一意義寫出，那就可斷定作者的失敗。</p>
<p>第三，其實這一階段是與第二階段同時進行的　，我們看了主人公的思想的轉變，我們一定要進一步找他的根據。這你就要澈底了解主人公的社會生活。你應着眼社會的實際。如果主人公的思想的轉變没有根據的話，那作品一定是失敗了。所謂思想變化的根據，大概是依他的生活的社會層當時社會羣團間的矛盾，政治經濟恐慌，大騷亂，革命，飢饑等現象。</p>
<p>第四，進行檢查作家反映在作品中的意識，這不僅限於在本篇内，我們還應多多找到作者的傳略，其他作品及他的實生活狀况，幫助我們對這一篇的了解。這一階段的進行，在平日對作者有了相當了解時，可以容易進行。</p>
<p>第五，至於這篇作品所表現的那個時代社會生活形態的檢閱，這應對當前的國際及本國的政治經濟的實况，社會羣團對抗的狀態，國内及世界大事，要有不歪曲的認識，客觀的視點，社會的熱情，及對大衆保持着不遠的距離。這全在平日關心各級社會生活的形態。當然，如果自已對時代没有一點認識，也就不能了解作品的時代性，這一階段的檢討，與整個的社會的外圍相聯繫。爲讀一篇作品才去看社會，這是不可能的。在這裏，我們也可看出不僅是作者卽讀者也應如何的來增長自已的人生經歷。</p>
<p>第六，關於技術的檢討，這一部分就是要讀者用科學的分析法去精心體會。本來所謂技術也是作家從不知不覺中創造出來的。但過去的經騐是可寶貴的，我們應接受前時代的遺産，這階段的應用，是多讀，多看，將整篇剖割爲幾部分，再將部分構成全體，從各方面去觀察。關於這一方面最好多看這一類的專書。</p>
<p>以上從第二到第六，我們不僅要用眼還要用手，用口，甚至於還要用脚到處去探訪。所以讀文學書决不是件容易事；决不是躺在「沙發」上那樣消閑的態度中就能獲得的。</p>

<p>業餘運動</p>
<h3 id="c297">運動在囚牢裏 <a href="#c297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— 李葵</p>
<p>牢裏的囚徒，他們在工餘之暇也需要運動。他們也知道體育和吃飯睡覺一樣的重要。</p>
<p>不過不像在外邊，選出一些人大出風頭；什麽選手，什麽健將，什麽美人魚之類是没有的。</p>
<p>他們是限於環境，他們是圈在很小很黑的牢裏，他們是没有機會運動的。</p>
<p>可是他們爲着避免身體更壞下去，以至於病，死，就中得不在小的範圍裏練練身體。</p>
<p>他們的運動，大約可分四種：</p>
<p>第一種是打手。這種是最普通的運動。每逢吃完飯，一些年青的囚徒，就齊集在一起打手起來。</p>
<p>這打手運動是這樣的：一定要有幾個人參加，參加了之後，就每個人伸出一隻手，落在一起；同時要另外一個人，隨便說一個數目；他們就按着次序的數，誰數到最後那個，誰就先被打。</p>
<p>被打的人要站在前邊，把左手放在右肩膀下，手心向外，好好的擺在腋部與背部之間，等着站在後邊的人打。後邊的人，要很技術的打打完了，被打的就馬上轉過身來猜，被猜對的就替他接着被打，若猜不對，他仍舊轉回身去被打。</p>
<p>這種打手運動，不但可以鍜鍊身體，而且還可以練達判斷力，眞是牢裏的一種最好的運動。</p>
<p>第二種是打球。這種不大普通，只有一些住過學校的囚徒來玩。</p>
<p>他們用的球子，不是外邊這種皮製的球子，裏邊是不許有這種皮球子的。他們用的球子是用飯做的。</p>
<p>每天吃飯時候，愛打球的，總要偷偷的留下一把飯，就是飯太少了，也寗可自已少吃一口，也要留下一把的。</p>
<p>他們把留下的飯，慢慢的用手搓得細細的，就像滑的麫一樣。以後就搓成圓圓的飯球，待牠乾一會，抛到墻上，就很有彈力，就可以像皮球似的馬上跳回來。</p>
<p>這樣就可以比賽了，凡是參加的，就按次序的上來打，和打網球一樣，誰要game了，就馬上下來，由第二個人接着打。</p>
<p>這種打球運動，也是囚徒的一種好運動，可是有時候，就發生了問題，飯球要被看守長看見，責駡一頓還不算，還要馬上將飯减少一些。理由是糟塌米飯啦！</p>
<p>第三種是跑步。冬天冷得没有辦法了，不能在破被絮裏取曖，夜間只得在號子裏跳舞丨丨其實他們那裏是跳舞，不但没有跳過舞，就是那堂皇的舞宫都不曾進去過；他們只是亂跳取暖，美其名而已丨丨白天就在弄堂裏跑步，每逢跑起來，差不多全弄堂的囚徒都參加，就只有幾個腿脚不靈的老頭子站在門裏看着。</p>
<p>一個跟着一個，在那二十幾步長，二三尺寛的弄堂裏，來回的跑着，一直都跑出汗了，他們才休息。</p>
<p>這種運動，有時也被干涉；因爲跑的脚步聲太大了，憲兵就會跑到弄堂口，敲着鐵門怒吼起來的。</p>
<p>第四種是游泳。這種運動也是借用名詞，牢裏又没有游泳池，怎麽游泳呢？這不是借用名詞是怎麽？</p>
<p>這是在他們熱得没有辦法的時候，就用木盆裝着水，在弄堂裏互相亂澆起來，閙閙閧閧的，也就像游泳似的。</p>
<p>這種運動，不過是變相的洗澡而已。這種運動，更常常要受干涉；但是因爲他們熱得没有辦法了，也就明知道會挨駡，甚至挨打，還照舊的亂澆。</p>
<p>這幾種牢裏的運動，說起來是很可憐的！要是和外邊的運動比一比，眞是有天壤之别啦！</p>
<p>限於環境的他們，能够做到這樣也就很使人滿意了；而且他們這　運動是普編的，他們運動是爲着大家的身體强健，不是專呌幾個人出風頭的。</p>

<p>一九零五年成功的齊柏林號，容積一萬一千三百立方米，爲空前的大型。全長百二十八米，直徑最大處十一米，備兩個八十五匹馬力的發動機，速率每秒十一米。</p>
<p>以前對於齊柏林惡感的人，均一反其從前的態度而變爲讚揚了。</p>
<p>後來成立齊柏林飛行船公司，大量製造飛行盤。自一九○○年至一九二四年二十五年間計建造達百二十九隻。其中四十八隻屬陸軍，六十五隻屬海軍，此外供軍用以外使用。</p>
<p>大家知道齊柏林飛行船歐戰時爲德國建立了很大的戰績。然而齊柏林氏堅苦的奮鬥，世人知道的很少，齊柏林自造的飛行船中七隻均爲暴風，火災所毁。然而每一次失敗，齊柏林更鼓勵其新的能氣，像不倒翁的樣子屢仆屢赴。我們明白了這白髮蒼蒼的老人的事業時，將怎樣剌激我們新的感覺呢？</p>
<p>一九一三年當齊柏林第七十五次誕生紀念時，全德共聲慶祝，在非勒特而司哈芬開盛大的慶祝會。那時，德皇對於齊柏林，送如次之祝圓文：</p>

<h3 id="c301">好萊塢的明星學校 <a href="#c301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— 密薺</p>
<p>門牆桃李頗多人才輩出　學校聲明此非終南捷徑</p>
<p>這個學校，並不呌好萊塢明星學校，但是因爲它的地點在世界的影都好萊塢，而畢業生頗多在影界蜚聲的人物，於是大家都稱那個學校，爲明星們的學校（ＳchoolofStars）了。其實它的名稱，就是好萊塢中學（ＨollywoodHighSchool）。現在我來講些關於這個學校的事情。</p>
<p>美國全國中小學校，何止千萬。其中學齡兒童，傾想着將來進電影界的，亦何止千百萬。這種兒童，不論男女，每年都不知有多多少少，從遠遠近近的地方，跑到好萊塢，要想一試身手。他們差不多都是在中學年齡的放棄了學校，離開了家庭，來到影都來尋覓機會。他們常常幾天不吃飯等待一個機遇。他們貧窮困苦了，什麽事情都肯做……洗碟子碗盞，領小孩子，做飯店堂信……等等一切……祇盼望着將來一天將側身影界。他們是不怕失望的，們心想如果他們永遠堅持下去，總有一天會有一個奇遇，掉落在他們的頭上的。但是至終是機會之神，不常降臨，而一般青年男女所得的結果，是心傷，幻滅，飢寒，流落，但是他們還不斷地來，不斷地希望。「到底這些學齡男女青年，有多少可以在影界成功的希望？他們放棄了學業，來尋覓黃金之源，是否得計？他們應當不應當先在各地本鄕學校畢業？你倘使將這種問題，去問好萊塢中學的畢業生，他們會告訴你，你還是繼續求學的好，你可以先不用天天在影片公司的門口乾等着，還是用些功夫在書本上吧！因爲他們所處的地位近，他們對於影城的一切事情，了解得更清楚些。他們會勸告你，還是不要離開你的學業家庭，而來到這個人浮於事，插足無地的地方吧！</p>
<p>說來很奇怪的，這個好萊塢中學的畢業生中，已經有多多少少進了電影事業而成功了。有一個畢業生說：「我在那裏讀書的時候，和我同歷史班的，有費蕾，馬塞琳戴，和克雷敦却尼；和我同英文班的有威廉琴南；曼琳本斯和開玲穆萊，是我們文學會的會員，曼琳麥許離開了學校去和約翰巴里摩亞拍戲去了；同學之中，現在在影界有名氣的，還有勃德利西亞阿佛萊，巴巴拉肯脫，本亞力山大，阿麗絲懷德等等七八人。但是他們之中，除去二個例外，其餘在學校的時候，却没有想到入影界的。非但學生們對於電影事對，不加注意，並且學校當局最不高興聽的，就是人家說：「那個學校是明星們的講習所」。裏面有一位英文敎員呌威廉都柏的，凡是那裏畢業的影界有名人物，十個之中有九個出於他手下的，但是他說：「我們對於志在電影事業的學生，盡力阻止他們入學。我們的學校是全國中學中，程度最高深的之一。所以我們應當維持我們學校的名譽和地位，而不使眞正降爲一種電影公司的招生機關。如果學生們要拿這裏當作一種息足的地方，靜待着影界裏的機緣，而不是眞正來此求學的，我們卽不認他是我們的好學生，而必須將他排除的！」</p>
<p>至於學生方面，他們亦有偶然在影片公司裏作個臨時演員，賺些零用錢的。但這個並不犯學校的定章，並且尋些小工作，賺些錢維持個人的生計，本來亦是美國全國通行的，不能拿好萊塢當作例外。可是學生們對於學校當局維持學府尊嚴的政策，却是全體一致贊成的，們他說學校畢業生中雖然有許多已經在影界成功，但這並不能影響到學校中的功課，學風等等，並且照事實上說，好萊塢中學畢業出來的男女學生，他們的踏進電影界、並不比其他學校出來的，有什麽更便捷的途徑云。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c302">評「愛的魔力」 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Sisters　Under　The　Skin</p>
<p>丨國泰丨</p>
<p>的確，哥倫比亞公司近來是「大展鴻圖」的從「太夫人」「一夜風流」直到這「愛的魔力」爲止，製片者當局確實是廢棄了那些西部片的計劃，面大規模的攝製所謂大片子了。這使觀衆多少改變了以前對於該公司的不良觀念。然而這决不是說「太夫人」或「一夜風流」都是完全成功的作品，不過是說粗製濫造的惡習，現在是掃滅將盡了。</p>
<p>就這「愛的魔力」來說，我們覺得首先值得注意的便是導演的手法。我的對於ＤavidBurton這個名字，也許並不怎樣熟習，然而就其在本片中的成績來說，有許多地方是值得我們讚美的。</p>
<p>第一，Ｍontage十分緊凑簡潔。在這中間找不出瑣碎的塲面，每一塲面都是戲的存在。諸如男女主人公在倫敦，在巴黎享樂的種種，以　女主人公在首飾店，在衣帽店的種種，都是高速度的複寫。此外還有許多不必要的過程，都很清潔的省略了。</p>
<p>第二，我們的應注意的，乃是Ｔempo的速度了。這和Ｍontage自然有着不可分離的關聯，也可以說是屬於Ｍontage之内的。而所以要特别指出的便是前述的諸塲面之高速度的展開，在描寫高貴的人們在糜爛的享樂中之需要强調的剌戟，這高速度的快，的確是最好的表現方法。而當葉斯心灰意懶的轉回他的辦公室的時候，以及以前發現了情人之内心苦痛的時候，那極弛緩的調子，對於主人公之内心的帮助，在極靜的空氣中，眞是十分有效果的。</p>
<p>第三，導演精密的注意每一塲戲的發展，也是值得注意的。當男女主人公第一次在花園中會唔的時候，男的强吻，女的拒絶而掌他面頰。（這是以後的伏綫）當葉斯知道了情人之對於自已的眞實的態度之後，他再來到她家裏未進房門之前，他走近鏡子，照照自已已老的容顔，几上有一盆嬌豔的花，立刻他覺得發冷，緊了一緊衣裳，悲哀而鎭靜的走進房問去。………這些地方，我們可以體會出一種冰凉的情感，而這正是由於細膩的塲面所獲得的。</p>
<p>第四，我們所得說及的便是鏡頭的活澄了。如前面所說及的享樂武購買衣飾等複攝的塲面，那許多仰角的鏡頭，眞是十分可取。然而他對於鏡頭的角度並不是無理由的活潑的，譬如男女主人公偕音樂家一步一步登樓的時候，爲了表示他們之間的年輕和老邁，鏡頭一直是俯攝。兩個年青人捷步如飛，毫不費力，而葉斯却是大爲吃力，終於坐在樓梯上休息，氣喘不已。這直到女主人公回來攙扶他爲止，鏡頭仍是同一角度。但是我們並不覺得厭煩，因爲這樣的，他們之間朝氣和暮氣的對比，乃是看得非常清楚而動人的。至於當音樂家奏着悲哀的提琴的時候，在不同的角度之下，攝取每一個相同情感的特寫的臉，再Ｄissolve到舞台上和周圍的聽衆，都是值得我們學習的了。</p>
<p>第五，至於其他對於周圍空氣的描畫，如以雨寫心情的悒悶，以夏夜的月和風寫男主人公的閒情逸致，以窗幔的微風寫藏嬌室的温矛，從這些地方，導演相當使用了象徵的手法，獲得了很好的成績。</p>
<p>如以上所述，自然我們不能忽視這大半是劇本的成功。這不僅是劇作者在創作過程中充分的注意到電影藝術的使用，而在主題上，我們也不能否認它有若干程度的嚴肅。固然，這裏所寫的僅僅是限於戀愛的範圍以内，而在寫一五十歲的人如欲獲得眞度的愛情，的確是不容易的事，最後終於是可怕的幻滅。從這一方面說，其中閒的過程，確是相當眞實寫得很吸。這也就是劇作者終極的目的。但是由於題材的選擇，在劇的效果上，他給與我們怎樣的印象呢？那葉斯一生爲發財而盡力，不能得着享樂的機會，雖然他有着仁善的心腸，他以多量的金錢買得了少女的情愛，但結果終於因着年齡的關係，祗是使少女限於愛的苦悶之中，而多量的金錢，到底不能買回消逝了的青春，最後是心灰意懶的在一度創傷之後，重新回到自已的事業中來。這，那位多錢的葉斯，便使觀衆們十分同情了。</p>
<p>在美國影片中，始終很難於離開這一方面的說敎，不過因其份量的關係，並不十分使我們厭惡罷了。然而客觀的鑒賞一種作品的藝術，也許我們不妨更注意了他們的表現方法了。至少這和許多成功的舊觀念的文學作品一樣，有好些地方是值得我們批判而欣賞的了。</p>
<p>女主角伊麗莎蘭地寫得還好，但並無超特之處，而男主角佛蘭克毛根，在這一影片中的成功，到底是我們應該表示驚異的。其他二配角丨丨葉斯的妻和音樂家，都很稱職。</p>

<p>Preparations for the Qing Tombs Protection Committee Are Complete</p>
<p>Traffic Plan for the War Zone is Drafted</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng came to Tianjin by train on the night of the 10th to request instructions on the acceptance of Malan峪 and the organization of the Qing Tombs Protection Committee. He went to the Provincial Government this morning to visit Yu Xuezhong. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng visited Yu Xuezhong to discuss various issues in the war zone. According to Yin, the acceptance date of Malan峪 has not yet been determined because of continuous rainy weather and poor traffic. When the water recedes, I and Chaisan will go and take a look, and then decide on the actual recovery period. It is expected that it can be done in early next month. The Qing Tombs Protection Committee will be established at the same time. At present, the members of the committee have been decided, only the representative of the Qing Dynasty has not yet been produced. Currently, Prince Tao, Prince Run, and others are discussing it. The standing committee members will have a monthly salary. There are no conditions for accepting Malan峪 and protecting the Qing Tombs, only the Japanese and puppets need to withdraw. The newly compiled special police team in the war zone is still waiting for Director Yin Tong to come back to negotiate. Recently, I have not discussed with Chaisan. The problem of the Yutian security team is being studied to find a thorough solution. The captains of the team are secretly expanding their troops, which has increased to more than 2,000 people, harassing the local area, so the rich residents in Yutian City have all moved elsewhere, and there are more robberies in the suburbs. The acting captain, Sun Jizhou, is unable to restrain them. If we do not quickly think of a solution, the consequences will be disastrous. The highway from Gubeikou and Malan峪 to Beiping and Tianjin is muddy and difficult to travel when it rains, and traffic is blocked. It is proposed to request funds to build ten sand and stone roads to serve as transportation arteries. Today, the Pingfang meeting was held to discuss this. Representatives from the Luanyu District also attended. This meeting was convened by me. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng told reporters that the preparations for the Qing Tombs Protection Committee have been completed. After discussing with Chaisan and consulting with Chairman Yu again, it can be established. Bandit forces in the war zone are rampant, a situation unprecedented in recent years. Methods have been drafted to suppress them, and the security teams in each county have been notified to deploy defenses. A detachment of security police has also been extracted from the General Office's guard to assist in defense in Malan峪. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Xinggong, the secretary of the Ji Mi District Office, said that the preliminary plan for sorting out the traffic problems in the war zone has been studied, and regulations have been made for the project budget, and draft plans have been drawn. Today, representatives from the Luanyu Ji Mi District and engineers from the Beining Railway are meeting in Ping to discuss the overall plan and revise the budget numbers to draft a draft. After Commissioner Yin has reviewed it, it will be submitted to the Hebei Provincial Government Military Branch, Political Rehabilitation Committee, and National Economic Committee to request funding, so that personnel can be sent to conduct on-site surveys and construction before the end of the year, and considerable progress can be made before the rainy season next year. This plan includes 1,700 kilometers of arterial and branch lines of highways in the entire district. The road surface will be constructed of mountain stone and slag roads, which will cost about 300 to 400 yuan per kilometer, including bridges, a total of 3 to 4 million yuan. There are about dozens of bridges in the entire district. The Luanyu District has a wider area, and its reorganization project is about one-fifth larger than the Ji Mi District. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Farewell to Students Going Abroad to Study <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>This year's students going abroad to study are about to leave the country. Today, thirty-odd cultural and academic institutions in the sea specially gave a joint farewell, in order to strengthen the trip. It's a very grand occasion. This newspaper is one of the hosts, how dare we not give a few words as a gift?</p>
<p>Because of the backwardness of education in our country, illiterate people are everywhere. Only the environment of you students is superior. Having received higher education at home, you are seeking masters overseas. Today, those who envy your happiness, I don't know how many people there are. You are truly "favored by heaven." Even we cannot help but celebrate it. However, we love you deeply and dare to ask you to suppress the joy in your hearts and be awe-inspiring in the responsibilities you bear.</p>
<p>First, I would like to ask you to reflect on yourselves. This time, I am temporarily leaving the storm-tossed motherland and going abroad as a guest. Am I really going to seek true knowledge, or am I going to "climb the dragon" and "gild myself"? If my purpose is to truly study, I must make up my mind to bury myself in hard work as soon as possible. Even during the travel period, I must not waste time. On the contrary, if my conscience tells me that my intention is only to go abroad for a trip, and use drinking the sea breeze as a means to show off in my hometown, then for those of you who are paying your own expenses, it is better to apply for a travel passport, saving you a lot of trouble such as reporting and enrolling. For those of you who are paying public expenses, it is even better not to go, giving up the empty seat to those who are willing but unable to do so, so as not to suffer extra pain when your conscience blames you later.</p>
<p>If your purpose is ostensibly to study, but in reality is only to obtain a degree, then we dare to comfort you that you will be able to achieve your wish on this trip. However, your purpose is still inevitably seemingly right but actually wrong. We know that the largest number of students who have gone abroad in the past have graduated from universities in China. The same is true this year. Therefore, we dare to assume that most of you are superior talents. Given your intelligence, plus considerable money and time, it will not be difficult to obtain a PhD or Master's degree in the future. But that being the case, the true value of so-called PhDs and Master's degrees can also be seen. You must know that today's society is gradually recognizing true talent, and the pursuit of knowledge values ​​practicality. If you only seek a degree as a skill, and barely pass during peacetime, then in the end you will only arbitrarily search for some reference books, quote out of context, and pile them up into a piece of writing, or even extract fragments from ancient Chinese books such as the "Nine Classics," and then hire someone to translate them into foreign languages ​​in order to sell them to professors in that country. Then you are not only deceiving others, but also deceiving yourself. I hope that you will go on this trip and take the concept of degrees a little lighter. What you bring back in the future should be true and solid strength attached to your hands and brains, not just a piece of parchment diploma and a few lines of crab-like certificate. "As long as the green hills remain, there is no need to worry about running out of firewood." If you have true and solid strength, even without empty titles such as foreign top scholar or foreign academician, someone will hire you sooner or later, and you will never be frustrated throughout your life. If you don't believe it, please look at the leading talents at home and abroad, many of whom were born as "illiterates," and have never been respected by the world.</p>
<p>Second, during your study abroad, your material enjoyment will definitely be even greater than at home. There are many temptations in the prosperity of overseas countries. If young people do not maintain their integrity, it is difficult to avoid being tempted by novelty. At worst, they will neglect their studies; at worst, they will humiliate the country. A moment's mistake will lead to lifelong regret. You have received higher education and should always and everywhere assume the responsibility of being a representative of the Republic of China. If so, the sordidness of the overseas study circles in the past can be swept away, which would be very gratifying.</p>
<p>Third, most of you are self-funded. You usually live in comfort and enjoy luxury, and you may not know the suffering of ordinary people. As you travel further and further away from the country, your impressions will fade. During your study abroad, what you see and hear are all foreign scenery and exotic customs. Residence changes one's temperament, and nurturing changes one's physique. Environmental influence is often unconscious. We often see a student going abroad with only one or two points of foreign style, and returning home with several points of foreign style, which are completely indistinguishable. It is because he has been completely transformed. This is the main reason why students are criticized. How can this shortcoming be avoided? It cannot be ignored. We believe that one way is to take the essence of others, not the outer skin. Especially, we should learn the production methods of others, not the consumption habits of others. The second is to recognize that you are one of the 400 million Chinese people, not just one of the 5,000 or 6,000 students studying abroad.</p>
<p>In summary, what we hope from you is only three things: (1) Seek real knowledge; (2) Uphold moral integrity; (3) Prevent foreign influence. Although what is said here is low and without much high argument, if you can implement them one by one, you will surely emit an unprecedented splendor in the study abroad world. The beneficiaries are not only you yourselves. Alas, the national crisis is imminent. You must know what kind of time China is in today, and what kind of responsibilities you will bear in the future. If you think about this, can you not be vigilant, fearful, and determined?</p>
<p>American Silver Nationalization</p>
<h3 id="e20">Attracts World Attention <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A person in charge of the Ministry of Finance said that the American silver nationalization order has attracted world attention. Our country is the country with the highest silver consumption in the world. The move by the US government will increase the price of silver, and it will undoubtedly increase our country's purchasing power in the Far East trade. However, we are not a silver-producing country, and using limited silver to purchase endless foreign goods has a great impact on the national economy. Moreover, unscrupulous merchants will purchase large quantities of silver for export. The Ministry of Finance has paid close attention to this and hopes that domestic experts will express their opinions so that they can be adopted. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A major embezzlement case by Japanese people suddenly broke out on the 7th of this month at the Manchukuo Railway's Shahekou Railway Factory, which once manufactured vehicles for the Ping-Shen Railway. The head of the factory's supplies yard, the Japanese person Tasaka Rokushi, privately sold the factory's materials and equipment, repeatedly stealing and transporting them out. Manchukuo Railway detected this and immediately arrested him. The total losses of the factory amounted to more than 5 million yuan. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington Studies Various Issues</p>
<p>Comparison of British, American, and Japanese Naval Strengths</p>
<p>(Washington) Since the preliminary naval disarmament conference was held in London, the US government authorities have been secretly studying various issues. Today, according to US government officials, the ones who should be asking for an increase in naval ratios are the British and Americans, not the Japanese. There are four reasons why the British and Americans should increase their ratios: First, with the current naval ratio, Japan is geographically immune to naval attacks; Second, in addition to its navy, Japan is also the only top-tier army power in the world. Therefore, even if the navy fails unexpectedly, the army will be its support. It is difficult for the navies of other countries to land; Third, Japan's farthest overseas territories and trusteeship islands are also within 2,500 miles of the mainland. Britain and the United States must defend their overseas territories far overseas in a month of war. Moreover, Japan's coastlines correspond from beginning to end, so the strategic and combat strength are vastly different. Fourth, Japan's current ratio is actually more than 5.5.3, because the British and American navies are not up to full strength, while Japan is not far from full strength. Government officials concluded that the existing ratio is generally commensurate and should not be changed. The ratio issue will be discussed in detail by the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan in mid-October. (11th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Rumor of Russian Cavalry Capturing Japanese People</p>
<p>Japanese Army Using Camels for Transportation</p>
<p>Request to Increase Escorts on the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>(Harbin) The shocking news received here is that a Mongolian and Russian cavalry detachment captured three Japanese people, one Russian person, and four Chinese people today near Tailanor (transliteration), 23 miles south of Manchuria. At a time when war rumors are rampant, there is more information, the Russian expatriates in Suifenhe are greatly alarmed and are leading their wives and children to move west. (11th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the Manchurian Incident, the Japanese army used camels in addition to military horses and military dogs to transport military materials and food in Rehe Desert, which was quite convenient. Because of its great value in military affairs, the military medical school brought back the camels from Rehe to study the results, and decided that the Japanese army would use camels for future operations. (11th Japanese Union Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) I received a report from Harbin that the director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Mr. Lu Tai, reported to the Ministry of Railways, claiming that the railway has been repeatedly attacked and derailed due to inadequate protection or even complete lack of protection. The latter claimed that from January to August 6 of this year, there were 16 derailment incidents, all caused by intentional damage to the track. In addition, there were 91 military attacks on various stations and along the road barracks, 116 road workers were lured, 46 were killed, 102 were injured, and arson and looting were also numerous. The out-of-track actions were particularly frequent between June 17 and August 6. As a result of the derailment, 21 locomotives and 207 road vehicles were greatly damaged. The road bureau's losses in this regard have exceeded 300,000 gold rubles. The total cost of medical treatment for injured road workers and employees also exceeded 100,000 gold rubles. Mr. Lu Tai further pointed out that in addition to requesting the Road Police Headquarters to send more guards, the Road Bureau also used various defense methods on its own, such as dispatching special reconnaissance vehicles. However, as attacks in the eastern part of the route increase daily, this method is still insufficient, because the road police do not take fundamental measures to protect the road. Although the Road Bureau has repeatedly submitted requests to the Road Police Headquarters every day, Mr. Lu Tai also cited the Headquarters' replies, among which there were direct refusals to protect, each with different reasons. In conclusion, he requested the Ministry of Railways to pay attention to the seriousness of the current situation on the Chinese Eastern Railway and the significance of road vehicle safety, and to require effective methods to guarantee that the entire road's buildings, property, and the lives of railway personnel would not be threatened by infringement.

<p>(Harbin) Today, another Chinese Eastern Railway train near Yimianpo was "destroyed by bandits." The "bandits" first dismantled the tracks about 50 miles from Yimianpo, and subsequently a westbound freight train derailed and overturned at that location, destroying two locomotives and nine train cars. After the derailment, the "bandits" opened fire with volleys of rifle fire, but no one was injured. However, five people were kidnapped by the "bandits." (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, the Navy Ministry, considering the great military value of Daitō Island (also known as Rasa Island) in the Pacific during wartime, has sent technicians to the island for investigation several times. It is now considered a military stronghold, and it is rumored that a 100-kilowatt radio station will be built on the island soon. Daitō Island is located about 300 miles east of Okinawa. The island's phosphate rock production is the highest in Japan. Currently, there are 500 workers from a phosphate mining company. Transportation is extremely inconvenient, with Japanese postal ships calling only once every three months. (China United Press, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Large Japanese Budget <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Each administrative ministry has now submitted its draft budget for next year to the Ministry of Finance, or indicated the approximate amount. The total new requests from each ministry amount to approximately 1,075,000,000 yen, including 49,450,000 yen from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 185,000,000 yen from the Ministry of Interior, 2,711,000 yen from the Ministry of Finance, 4,541,000 yen from the Ministry of Justice, 29,771,000 yen from the Ministry of Education, 350,000,000 yen from the Ministry of the Army, 294,700,000 yen from the Ministry of the Navy, 113,000,000 yen from the Ministry of Agriculture, 12,000,000 yen from the Ministry of Commerce, 18,140,000 yen from the Ministry of Communications, and 16,000,000 yen from the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. It is expected that the new requests will exceed 1,200,000,000 yen, as the above figures do not include the 80 million yen in subsidies for the depreciation of the yen in foreign debts paid by the government, and other expenses. The regular budget totals approximately 1,600,000,000 yen, an increase of 200 million yen compared to the current budget, due to the need to implement the Second Naval Replenishment Program. Therefore, if the new requests are approved by the Ministry of Finance, the total expenditure for next year's budget will be approximately 2,800,000,000 yen. However, according to responsible sources, the Ministry of Finance, in order to consolidate finances, plans to reduce the new requests by half, namely 600 million yen, and at the same time limit the amount of new government bonds to be issued to cover the budget shortfall to 800 million yen or less, which is the amount permitted to be issued this year.

<p>Japanese Plan to Reform Institutions in Manchuria</p>
<h3 id="e30">Hirota Plans to Strengthen the Economic Alliance between Japan and Manchuria <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The original plan of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Colonial Affairs regarding the reform of the institutions stationed in Manchuria, which would change the current tripartite system to a dual system, has unanimous support and no opposition. However, regarding the issue of supervisory authority, the three ministries have different opinions. The Army Ministry intends to assign the supervisory authority of the Ambassador Plenipotentiary in Manchuria to the Prime Minister, who would then implement all affairs such as diplomacy, administration, and military affairs through the Ambassador. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' original plan is for the Foreign Minister to supervise the Ambassador in Manchuria, implement diplomatic and administrative affairs, and entrust only military administration and command to the Commander of the Kwantung Army, with the Army Minister supervising the Commander. In the future, at an appropriate time, the Ambassador in Manchuria and the Commander of the Army would be separated into two entities, as a transitional measure. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs focuses on the command system of diplomatic, administrative, and military affairs, and a clear division of labor. The diplomatic affairs of the Ambassador Plenipotentiary in Manchuria would be supervised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, administrative affairs by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and military affairs by the Army Minister. Therefore, its content is largely the same as the current tripartite system. With such different original plans from the three ministries, disputes will inevitably arise when the issue is properly discussed in the future. It seems that there is no other way but for Prime Minister Okada, Foreign Minister Hirota, and Army Minister Hayashi to resolve the issue through political means. (Japan United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota's plan to reform the institutions stationed in Manchuria, in addition to maintaining the dual system concept, attempts to establish a Japan-Manchuria Economic Committee to plan for the strengthening of the economic alliance between Japan and Manchuria. Hirota has already declared the establishment of this committee at the 65th Diet. However, when it is materialized, an economic treaty will be signed between the two countries to ensure the closeness of the economic alliance. It is said that the Japan-Manchuria Economic Committee will recruit first-class politicians, industrialists, and scholars from both countries as the highest organ for forming an economic alliance. (Japan United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry's draft regarding the reform of the institutions stationed in Manchuria was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the other day. However, the Foreign Affairs authorities have a rather cold attitude towards this and firmly oppose the Army Ministry's plan, claiming that if the Army authorities insist on implementing such a reform plan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is unwilling to conduct consultations and will instead advocate maintaining the current tripartite system. The views of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this issue are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>1. Based on the spirit of the Imperial Rescript issued when Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, the Japanese government should strengthen the conditions of the Japan-Manchuria Protocol and do its best to assist "Manchukuo" in its independence and development.</p>
<p>2. The current tripartite system should be rationally reformed when the time for reform arrives. The method is to retain the Ambassador Plenipotentiary and the Commander of the Kwantung Army as a dual system, with the Governor of Kwantung being the administrative head within the Kwantung Leased Territory, supervised by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs.</p>
<p>3. "Manchukuo" is an independent country, and Japan should send a diplomat supervised by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>4. The system of the Commander of the Kwantung Army concurrently serving as the Ambassador to Manchuria should be abolished. The Commander of the Kwantung Army is purely a military administrative organ, specializing in command matters. In the future, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will specially appoint an independent Ambassador to Manchuria.</p>
<p>5. All rights relating to judicial, administrative, and economic matters should be gradually returned to "Manchukuo" as "Manchukuo" develops.</p>
<p>6. The system of an Ambassador to Manchuria directly under the Prime Minister, as advocated by the Army Ministry, is a kind of deformed organ with both diplomatic and administrative functions, similar to a governor-general or commissioner system, and lacks the diplomatic function of an Ambassador Plenipotentiary. Not only is the system itself unreasonable, but it is also easy to arouse suspicion among other countries regarding Japan's attitude towards Manchuria. Since the Imperial Rescript recognizes "Manchukuo" as an independent country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs absolutely opposes the Army's reform plan.</p>
<p>The opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Army Ministry regarding the reform of the institutions stationed in Manchuria are so contradictory, and negotiations between the two sides on this issue have stalled, making the future quite bleak. (Japan United Press, 11th)</p>

Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to meet with him this afternoon or Monday. Diplomatic circles here believe that the meeting between the two is very important. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Vice Chancellor Starhemberg suddenly departed for Rome. According to sources in the Prime Minister's residence, the trip is to inspect the Austrian camp near Rome, where several teams of Austrian youth are currently stationed. According to political circles, the Vice Chancellor will also meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to prepare for the official visit of Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>In Vienna, Deputy Prime Minister Starhemberg declared to journalists today that although the Austrian people mentally support the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty, it is not yet time to discuss this issue, because the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty is by no means purely an Austrian issue and will encounter opposition from neighboring countries. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>In Rome, the deposed Austrian Empress Zita has arrived here from Belgium and is staying at the villa of Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma.

<p>In Vienna, Deputy Prime Minister Starhemberg issued a declaration to the press, saying, "Terrorist partisans are intent on disrupting Austria's internal peace. The Austrian government is determined to eradicate them completely. Hitlerism is also what the Austrian government must eliminate." The Prince also said that when disturbances occurred in Carinthia, many of the Nazi party members who participated in the disturbances spoke with German accents, which shows that the masterminds behind the recent tragedy were actually outside Austrian territory. Regarding Italy's assistance to Austria at the time of the recent coup, the Prince said, "We will never forget Italy's friendly attitude towards our country." (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Nazi party cadres have announced the dissolution of the Austrian Nazi party army. According to news from Munich, the barracks of the Austrian party army in various places in Bavaria have been partially withdrawn. It is said that the Austrian party army has been prohibited from going out since the Austrian coup on July 25 and is being closely monitored by special agents. According to news from Munich, the party headquarters of the Austrian Nazi party in Munich has also been dissolved. If this news is true, it should have a considerable relationship with Austria's approval of Papen as the envoy to Austria. Although the Austrian party army has been dissolved, the soldiers of the party army still need to be settled. It is estimated that the first task of the new envoy Papen after taking office will be to discuss with the Austrian government how Austrian political exiles can return to their country.

Recently, according to the German news agency DNB, Hitler has appointed Bürckel, the leader of the Nazi party in the Palatinate district, to succeed Papen in Saar affairs. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Italian Army and Air Force Hold Joint Exercises</p>
<p>(Paris) The Socialist Party announced today that French military spending is extremely high. Since January 1928, French military expenditure has totaled 102,000,000,000 francs, an average of 14,600,000,000 francs per year, with 46,000,000 francs per day being used for armaments. The 4,000,000,000 francs in extraordinary military expenditure recently approved by the French parliament is actually the beginning of France's arms race in the army, navy, and air force. Regarding armaments, the budget for eastern frontier defense has now exceeded 65 percent, and there are 25 types of arms orders, one of which has a contractor who is a member of parliament, amounting to 831,000,000 francs, while the original budget was only 324,000,000 francs. Since 1924, many large oil tanks have been built, and when it was discovered that they were easy to destroy, 500 million francs were used to build underground bomb-proof oil tanks.

<h3 id="e38">International Monetary Conference <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Aimed at Coordinating a Gold and Silver Price Standard</p>
<p>So That World Finance May Stabilize Sooner</p>
<p>Nationalization of Silver Is Generally Seen as Prelude to Expansionary Policy</p>
<p>(London) The "Daily Telegraph" in the United States today quoted a Washington dispatch as saying that after the US authorities announced the nationalization of silver, they will now conduct informal talks with foreign countries in order to convene an international conference as soon as possible to discuss the issue of financial stabilization, the main purpose of which is to coordinate a fixed standard for the value of gold and silver currencies. "The Times" in London also predicted in a Washington dispatch that an international monetary conference would eventually be convened and said that the legal gold content in the dollar may soon be reduced again by presidential order. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Observers familiar with the situation here expect that President Roosevelt will launch an international monetary conference after nationalizing silver. Roosevelt has always advocated a stable monetary policy and there should be no change now. As for the financial authorities, they are busy drafting various regulations after the nationalization of silver, but it is heard that the Treasury Department still needs to observe how all parties react before it can be announced. The President and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau are scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM today, and the discussions will likely be about the silver issue. It is still unclear here whether the government's move is an expansionary policy. Government officials claim that this move is just one step in the process of stabilizing the gold-silver ratio, but Wall Street people in New York mostly believe that this is a prelude to a large-scale expansionary policy. Newspapers across the country have largely expressed their approval, but "The New York Times" said that it is too early to evaluate its merits or demerits. Observers believe that the government's move does not cost anything because the government is just taking away the existing silver and issuing silver certificates. However, if the Treasury Department sets the value of the silver certificates issued at $1.29, the result is still uncertain. Also, the value of silver coins can be reset, all of which have inflationary tendencies. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) People here are unwilling to express opinions on the magnitude and consequences of President Roosevelt's order regarding the nationalization of silver. However, it is generally believed that the international market price of silver bullion will depend entirely on American policy in the future. In addition, the financial markets are studying whether the American purchase of silver will be limited to the United States or will involve foreign markets. It is reported that 6 million ounces have already been purchased by the US government in the free market this week, and there are other quantities that are scheduled to be shipped to the United States next week. In the past, the United States first purchased gold domestically and then gradually purchased it from foreign markets. It would not be surprising if the same steps were taken for silver this time. According to yesterday's order, the domestic purchase period is set at three months, so after the expiration, it will gradually extend to foreign markets. People here believe that the trend of the silver market largely depends on the amount of silver purchased by the United States. We know very well that the policy adopted by the United States will eventually lead to the purchase of a lot of silver. However, China, which stores silver, can sell a portion of its stored silver at the current market price and still make a profit. What is unknown is what currency the United States will pay for the purchase of silver. China certainly favors purchasing with gold, but it would be very difficult for the United States to sell a portion of its stored gold to purchase silver. Before the American policy is clearly revealed, the financial markets are quite inclined to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. However, it is generally believed that Roosevelt's decision represents a further step in the path of inflation in the United States. Whether this observation is correct can be temporarily set aside.

The Deutsche Bank will directly pay 5% of the value of the goods to British exporters in gold pounds, and the remaining 95% will be credited to the Bank of England's account in marks. The entire price of all goods purchased from Germany by British importers will be paid into the Bank of England in gold pounds, and the Bank of England will convert it into marks and credit it to the Deutsche Bank's account, transferring it to German exporters. However, this is not related to the British Empire's possessions. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>Germany Protests to Russia</p>
<p>(Moscow) The German Chargé d'Affaires to Soviet Russia, Mr. Twardowski, today made a serious protest because Soviet Russian newspapers were wantonly attacking major German steel factories. The matter originated from the carelessness of a huge machine manufacturing factory in the Mailbu Volt region of the Soviet Russian Urals. When investigating the case, the Soviet Russian authorities stated that the case was arson in nature and that the instigator was a manufacturer of foreign goods. Soviet Russian newspapers immediately based on this statement and elaborated extensively, specifying that the five major German iron factories of Demag, Krupp, Sack, Heytrolik, and Kleyer were the instigators of the case, and claimed that these factories had been spying on industrial secrets in Soviet Russia for many years. In addition to publicly protesting, the German Chargé d'Affaires also said that the attacks by Soviet Russian newspapers were impossible, as German factories have always been enthusiastic in assisting and cooperating with Soviet Russian industry.

<p>Relief for Salt Workers in Twelve Forts</p>
<h3 id="e48">Agreed on Fundamental Solutions <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Hundreds of thousands of laborers involved in the sail transport of Huai salt from the Twelve Forts (十二圩) in northern Jiangsu have faced dire straits since the Salt Transport Administration switched to rotating transport using boats from Hunan and Anhui. This situation has severely impacted local security. Previously, representatives of the transport workers repeatedly petitioned the central government, and the provincial government dispatched Commissioner Wang Bo-ling to consult with Finance Minister Kong regarding relief measures. In addition to the temporary measures, such as reverting 100 tickets from Hunan to sail transport and uniformly implementing sail transport in Anhui, which have already been implemented, it has now been learned that fundamental solutions have also been carefully agreed upon by Finance Minister Kong and Commissioner Wang, in consultation with representatives from the salt transport industry and labor. These include: (1) establishing factories, and (2) relocating workers for employment. The first measure involves establishing a large-scale sack factory in the Twelve Forts area to accommodate unemployed salt workers and those willing to change professions. The second measure involves recruiting laborers from the fort areas, with public funds being used to send them to northern Jiangsu to engage in projects such as road construction, river dredging, and dike building within the salt-producing areas. It is understood that the projects in northern Jiangsu are sufficient to sustain a majority of the workers for three years. During this period, plans will be made to establish other factories. Additionally, ship owners will be given appropriate subsidies to facilitate their transition to other professions. When these measures are implemented, the provincial government will dispatch personnel to assist in the process to ensure smooth progress. (Central News Agency Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>Increasing troops and building camps to clearly show their attitude</p>
<p>Conspiracy activities, secret struggles, and ingenuity</p>
<p>Harbin News: The war situation in the Far East has reached a critical point. Both Japan and Russia are in a state of heightened tension. In addition to increasing troops and building camps in their respective areas and actively engaging in construction equipment to clearly show their attitude, they are also mutually exposing military intelligence. It is truly a scene before the eve of a major war. According to reliable sources, the Soviet government has selected a site in Outer Mongolia to build a large-scale barracks, which is currently housing a mixed unit of cavalry, artillery, and machine gun units. The details of the Soviet troops stationed in Outer Mongolia and the deployment of forces in the Far East are summarized as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e112">Reception of Malanyu and Custody of Qing Tombs <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Only the withdrawal of Japanese troops is lacking</p>
<p>All preparations are ready</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The reception of Malanyu, through the consultations between Yin Rugeng and Shibayama, has recently been scheduled for implementation within the month. However, the reception date has not been agreed upon due to Yin Rugeng's illness. It is reported that when Malanyu is received, in addition to the establishment of a branch office of the Jiji Administrative Commissioner's Office, there will be no other new organizations. As for the custody of the Eastern Tombs, our side will establish a custody committee, with Yin Rugeng as the chairman, the director of the Malanyu Commissioner's Office branch office, the magistrate of Xinglong County, and a Qing Dynasty prince residing in Pingjin as standing committee members. Sixteen articles of rules of procedure have been established for custody. Lost sacrificial vessels will be retrieved by any means possible. For years, because the tombs were in the war zone, no one took care of them, resulting in the theft of trees within dozens of miles around. This spring, the puppet Jehol army stationed in the area colluded with treacherous local people and secretly cut down trees. Even small saplings were stolen and sold. Therefore, from Malanyu to the Eastern Tombs, only stumps remain, with not a single tree left. This time, the puppet side proposed conditions for our custody, requesting that the Eastern and Western Tombs be merged for custody, expanding the establishment of the custody committee, allocating a certain amount of funding, recruiting tomb-guarding security teams, having the commissioner stationed at both tombs year-round, and planting trees. Our side believes that the Western Tombs are in our territory and have always been well-maintained, so there is no need to mention them together with the Eastern Tombs. Because the Eastern Tombs are outside Malanyu, the reception of Malanyu will complete the administration of Xinglong County. Therefore, the tomb area must be received and kept together. Otherwise, we have not recognized the legitimacy of the puppet court in Guandong, so how can we take care of their tombs? The Eastern Tombs originally had 30 tomb-guarding soldiers, but their firearms were confiscated by the Japanese army after the war. This time, new guns will be issued after the reception, without recruiting any additional tomb-guarding teams to avoid excessive waste. Previously, the chairman of Hebei Province, Yu Xuezhong, told people that Malanyu is our land. Only after the Battle of the Great Wall did the Japanese army move in and place it under semi-military occupation. Our magistrate of Xinglong County has established administration locally, and all organizations are ready. Only because the Japanese army does not withdraw can the government not fully exercise its power. The Tanggu Truce stipulates that Japanese troops will withdraw from various places along the Great Wall within one year. Everything related to our side in the Truce has been fulfilled, but the Japanese side has not done one thing. Malanyu has no so-called reception. It originally belonged to our land, and we should have administrative organizations. Only the withdrawal of Japanese troops is lacking. The so-called reception now has a tendency to expand and publicize. We are determined to handle the custody of the Qing Tombs unconditionally. If it contains some conditions and is carried out with solemnity, we will definitely not do it, etc. (8th)</p>

<h3 id="e113">Guangdong Border Strengthens Defense <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, the communist bandit disasters in Fujian Province have become increasingly urgent. Chiang Bo-cheng, the liaison commissioner of the Central Army stationed in Guangdong, received a telegram on the 4th from Jiang Dingwen, commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route Army, reporting on the bandit situation, roughly as follows: (1) Parts of the puppet 79th Army Corps and miscellaneous communist bandits, about 9,000 in total, led by Luo Binghui, are fleeing through Yong'an and Youxi, seemingly plotting to flee to western Fujian. (2) North of Longyan, a part of the puppet 14th Division and local communists, about 4,000 in total, are taking advantage of the situation to rob food and flee without a fixed location. Li Yannian is searching and suppressing them, and many bandits have been killed. (3) Because the puppet army corps suffered too many casualties, they have incorporated the local Young Pioneers, model battalions, Red Guards, etc., into the various army corps. (4) The puppet 135th Army Corps, after being defeated by our Tang Column in the area south of Baishui, is now entrenched in the area north of Shicheng. In this battle, more than 700 bandits, including the regiment commander, were killed, and more than 100 guns were captured. (Omitted below) Jiang Dingwen, Jiang Yin, and others, in addition to reporting the bandit situation by telegram, also requested the Guangdong authorities to send troops to Fujian to assist in the suppression. For this matter, Chen Jitang specially convened a border defense meeting yesterday with the anti-bandit generals of the Southern Route Army stationed in Guangdong, and the resolutions were made. The matter concerns military secrets and cannot be published, but the first and second columns in the front have been telegraphed to strengthen their defenses to prevent the communist bandits from fleeing south.

<p>Disaster Relief Association Asks the Provincial Government to Borrow Money</p>
<p>Relend to Various Counties to Hold Down Grain Prices</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Disaster Relief Association believes that this year's natural disasters are prevalent, and drought is rampant. Under this serious situation, adjusting the people's food supply is the only way to relieve the emergency at present. Therefore, it held a temporary meeting the other day. At the meeting, Standing Committee Member Fang Xiaoyuan proposed that since the drought has already formed and rice prices are rising, such as in Wangjiang and Tongcheng counties, disturbances have already occurred. Now, for the sake of emergency treatment, the provincial government should implement the borrowing of large amounts of money from the banking sector and relend it to various counties to hold down grain prices, in order to save the people's food supply and maintain public order. It was resolved and passed, but this borrowing method should be the responsibility of each borrowing county to repay on time. However, the interest and depreciation losses are unavoidable. It is proposed that the interest be borne by the government and the depreciation losses be compensated by the counties themselves. The burden borne is also light, and the methods will be determined separately. A special letter has been sent to the provincial government for verification and handling. In addition, the association believes that the reports of drought from various counties, and the many telegrams requesting investigation, have reached dozens of counties. It is urgent to select appropriate personnel for investigation. In addition to using the savings from the association's temporary expenses, the insufficient amount has been telegraphed to the provincial government, ordering the Finance Department to allocate 2,000 yuan for subsidies.

<h3 id="e115">Hubei Province Implements Work Relief <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Construction to Begin First in 20 Counties such as Wuchang</p>
<p>Counties Set Up Offices to Substitute Work for Relief</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Hubei Province's disaster relief measures are divided into three categories: emergency relief, work relief, and agricultural relief. Emergency relief is carried out in the most severely affected areas due to the lack of large funds. Agricultural relief is also unable to replant due to the lack of rain. Work relief is imminent. The provincial government recently formulated a seven-program plan, including purchasing water pumps, setting up siphons, opening up ponds and weirs, and dredging ditches. The estimated cost is 2.4 million yuan. The Disaster Relief and Famine Preparedness Committee has now drafted a construction outline based on this plan, which was passed and implemented at a meeting on the 10th. The main contents are: (1) The scope of work relief includes the following 20 counties for repairing ponds, weirs, and ditches: Wuchang, Echeng, Puqi, Huanggang, Huangpi, Guangji, Huangmei, Yunmeng, Xiaogan, Yingcheng, Hanyang, Xianning, Jiayu, Huang'an, Macheng, Xishui, Qichun, Yangxin, Daye, and Jingshan. Setting up siphon pipes will be tentatively set in ten places: Wutai Gate, Wufeng Gate, Sanyanqiao Gate, Baofeng Gate, Sigu Gate, Yangsiji, Kanjiage, and Zhanggong Embankment. Those installing pumping machine boats will be placed first in two lakes in the suburbs of Wuhan. (2) Agency Organization: Each work relief county will set up a work relief office, with one director, appointed by the county magistrate, one deputy director, appointed by the engineering team's chief engineer, and one auditing commissioner, jointly appointed by the financial team and the auditing team. Two clerks will handle all the affairs of the office under the orders of the director and deputy director. One secretary will be appointed, along with 10 to 20 supervisors, one surveyor, and one worker. At each place where a siphon pipe is set up, one craftsman and one assistant will be assigned. For the pumping machine boats, two craftsmen and two assistants will be assigned to each boat. (3) Disaster Worker Organization: Work relief workers will be standardized as strong men, with 25 people as a squad and ten squads as a regiment, totaling 250 people. Each squad will have a squad leader, and each regiment will have a regiment leader, both selected from among the honest and intelligent workers. (4) Allocation of Work Funds: A. Each county will excavate 20 new ponds, each requiring 9,000 cubic meters of earth. At 10 cents per cubic meter, 200 ponds will require 180,000 yuan. B. Each county needs to repair 20 existing ponds and weirs, each requiring about 1,500 cubic meters of earth. At 10 cents per cubic meter, 200 ponds will require 30,000 yuan. C. It is tentatively planned to excavate ditches with a length of 125 kilometers, with about 3,000 cubic meters of earth per kilometer. At 10 cents per cubic meter, 50,000 yuan will be required. D. 15-inch siphon pipes will be set up at each location, with four pipes per location, each costing about 2,000 yuan, so ten locations will require 80,000 yuan. E. Two 20-horsepower pumping machine boats, each costing 10,000 yuan, will require 20,000 yuan. The above five items total 360,000 yuan for work funds. This is the first step of the project planned with existing funds. As for installing pumping machines in various areas and building water diversion and drainage gates, dams, culverts, ditches, etc., implementation will be planned after work funds are available.

<p>Each township in this county has suffered from drought for a long time. The rice seedlings are withered, and the disaster is fully apparent. Farmers are bailing water day and night, and they are all exhausted, with huge losses. Although there was rain at the beginning of this month, it stopped after a few minutes and then cleared up again. Now there has been no rain for another ten days. According to recent surveys, the drought in the eighth district, Shanyang, is the most severe in the entire county, with 30 or more towns and villages such as Qijiadun Township, with a disaster area of 4,500 mu. In order to relieve the suffering of the drought, the county's agricultural extension station purchased two bailing machines, which were purchased in Song a few days ago and will be transported to the disaster area for use in the near future. It also provided dozens of bags of buckwheat, mung beans, etc., and distributed them to farmers in five locations: Shanyang, Caojing, Jinshanwei, Jinshan Mouth, and Jiangzhuang, for planting. It is also learned that a large number of rice borers and locusts have been found in the rice fields of Yanduntou and other townships in Punan recently. Once they bite, the rice seedlings will wither immediately. If no measures are taken to eliminate them, the autumn harvest will be hopeless.</p>

<p>Lu Zhonghe, the abbot and Taoist priest of the Jade Emperor Pavilion, has accepted five disciples, Da Ming, Da Zhen, Da Yuan, Da Ru, and Jiu Cheng, all of whom are underage. They disappeared from the temple on March 23rd while learning scriptures. After searching everywhere, there was no news. After reporting to the court to summon Lu Laotai, who was suspected, there was no evidence. It was ordered to be released on bail. Unexpectedly, on the 7th, a friend from Shanghai came to the temple to inform them that the lost disciples were hiding in a temple in Gujia Ting Temple, No. XX, Haichao Temple, Zhonghua Road, Shanghai. They were arrested on their behalf and sent to Song Yunyun. As expected, Da Ming, Da Zhen, and Jiu Cheng were sent back yesterday. Da Wu and Da Ru, it is said, have already returned home. It is said that the abductors were Yang Jianglin and others.</p>

<p>In the kidnapping case of Ni Bu Jin, the son of Ni Lai Sheng, from Shanzixing, Jinshanwei, the water patrol team arrested two kidnappers, Zhang A Zhao and Zhou A San. Because the area belonged to Jin County, they were sent to Jin for interrogation. The Ben Bao was logged. Afterwards, the team found out that Zhang A Zhao and others were the wanted criminals who shot and killed Zhang Zhipeng, the squad leader of the Jiangzhuang Police Team. They should be brought to justice to comfort the soul of the hero. The county government has prepared a document and sent Shen Shousheng, captain of Water Patrol Team No. 1, to Jinshan County to receive and extradite them.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Wuxi Rice Industry Automatically Limits Rice Prices <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The county government of this county previously received a provincial order to limit rice prices. After submitting it to the administrative affairs meeting for discussion, the county sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, which in turn sent a letter to the rice bean industry association, urging it to earnestly guide them. After receiving the letter from the Chamber of Commerce, the association submitted it to the 46th executive and supervisory committee meeting for discussion. It was agreed that this year's weather is arid, and the river channels are shallow, hindering transportation. The source of supply is scarce, and the purchases of various gangs are more concentrated. As a result, public sentiment is rising, and rice prices are gradually rising, with no nature of manipulation. Fortunately, last year's harvest was abundant, and warehouse stocks are still thick, which can be used for emergencies. Moreover, the new early indica rice in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has already entered the market. If the river water can rise slightly, it can still come in a steady stream. Shanghai has imported foreign rice, which will be imported into the interior in the future to regulate rice prices and maintain balance. It is not expected to have odd results. At present, the Shanghai market has a fixed case that white japonica rice should not exceed 13 yuan. Therefore, we should also respect the official care for the people's food and decide to automatically limit the white japonica rice to no more than 12 yuan per stone. A letter was sent back to the Chamber of Commerce, and yesterday it was transferred back to the county government for record.</p>
<h3 id="e120">River Dredging Dispute Causes Strike in the Entire Town <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Nan Yan Township Ganlu Town in the eighth district has a river that is silted up. Coupled with this year's arid weather, the river water is even shallower. Therefore, Zhang Zhiduan, the town chief of the town, initiated a meeting of all the residents of Yejijian to discuss and find ways to open the river. Ren Gencai from Hongdeji undertook the river dredging project. At that time, a total of 2,400 cubic meters of earth were measured, and it was stated that the wages per cubic meter of earth were 7 cents. By the other day, all the work was completed, and the wages had been paid in full. Unexpectedly, when the foreman Ren Gencai remeasured it, there were suddenly 6,800 cubic meters of earth. After deducting the previously paid amount, more than 3,000 yuan were still required. Town Chief Zhang argued that the difference was too great. However, the foreman relied on the crowd and acted barbarously. Yesterday morning, he led hundreds of workers, each holding wooden sticks, iron hoes, and other weapons, to disturb the town, intending to use force. At that time, the situation was serious, and the residents were panicked. All the shops in the town were on strike. Later, Town Chief Zhang reported the matter to the district branch and the public security branch, which sent police to the town to suppress it. By about 12 o'clock, the shops gradually reopened. On the one hand, Gao Shichun, the patrol officer of the branch, contacted the workers' representatives, but no agreement had been reached by the evening, and they were still insisting on their demands.</p>

<p>The Xicheng long-distance bus reduced its prices yesterday (the 11th). Wuxi to Jiangyin is 5 cents per person, Qingyang 4 cents, Tangtouqiao 3 cents, and Yanqiao 2 cents. Jiangyin to Qingyang is 3 cents. The fares are the same in both directions. Yesterday was the date of implementation. The business car owners, upon hearing this, believed that if it was implemented, their business would inevitably decrease. In order to maintain their livelihood, they stopped all the drivers. Unexpectedly, this aroused the drivers' resentment. Yesterday morning, dozens of them gathered and went to the county party headquarters to petition for relief. The county party headquarters agreed to convene the county government, the construction bureau, and others to discuss solutions. On the one hand, they notified the long-distance bus company to postpone the price reduction, but they were unable to comply. The drivers were very angry and drove the empty cars to solicit business in the middle of the road, creating a tense situation. The police arrived to maintain order. The matter had not been resolved by the afternoon.</p>

<p>In the Sifang Bridge Houtangwan area, about four li northwest of Zhangjing Bridge in the Sixth District, large swarms of locusts were discovered at approximately 6:00 AM yesterday (the 11th). They stretched for about half a li. However, they have not yet developed wings. Currently, they are in the vicinity of major cemeteries, and the leaves on the graves have been completely devoured. Upon hearing the news, local villagers in the area were extremely alarmed. Swayed by superstition, they gathered hundreds of men and women to set up an altar and chant scriptures, hoping the locusts would go elsewhere. The loss to the crops in the fields is still slight, it is said.</p>

<p>On the 10th, the Wuyi County Public Security Bureau, based on a report from He Gengling, a patrol officer of the 7th Direct Jurisdiction Sub-station of Hutang Bridge, apprehended Zhao Shijun, a suspect involved in selling narcotic pills, along with sealed bags of the pills. Section Chief Wang Chongxian conducted a preliminary interrogation and traced the source of the pills. Zhao Shijun confessed that he purchased the pills from Yang Chuan'er at No. 3 at the base of the west city wall. Yang also entrusted him to sell them in the surrounding villages. Based on this information, Section Chief Wang believed that Yang Chuan'er's manufacturing and selling of narcotics could not be easily dismissed. He reported this to Bureau Chief Xu Baoguang, who ordered several officers to accompany Zhao Shijun to the address for investigation and arrest. A large number of pill-making tools and raw materials for narcotics were found in Yang's residence, and the principal offender, Yang Chuan'er, along with his mistress Zhu Qian, the homeowner Yang Zhanlan, and suspects Zhang Wenbi and Li Mubai, were apprehended. After a preliminary interrogation at the bureau, they were handed over to the county for further questioning on the 11th.</p>

Wu aimed a toy gun at A'bao as if to shoot him. Unexpectedly, there was still a bullet in the gun that had not been removed. The trigger was accidentally pulled, and with a "bang," the bullet struck A'bao in the lower abdomen. He immediately collapsed and died from profuse bleeding. Police officer Wu was placed under guard by Sub-bureau Chief Li Dequan and was transferred to the County Public Security Bureau for questioning this morning (the 10th).</p>

<p>The Su Lang garrison of the Reclamation Special District used to be approved by Zhang Jian to be transferred to the Tonghai Reclamation Company. Two years ago, Yu Bujiud and others accused the company of illegal occupation and filed a complaint with the Ministry of Military Affairs. As a result, the ministry ordered the company to pay for the land. However, this case has many complications and remains unresolved. Yesterday (the 9th), the Ministry of War specifically dispatched Hu Qin, the director of the First Military Assets Investigation Team, to Haimen to investigate, and ordered the county government to assist in the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Yangzhou Baoguang Temple Hill Uncovers a Red Pill Manufacturing Ring <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Acting on a confidential report, the Jiangdu Public Security Bureau discovered that Chu Ping, the abbot of Baoguang Temple in Nanchenglimen, secretly established a ring to privately manufacture and sell red pills, and was also involved in opium consumption. Early in the morning on the 10th, the bureau dispatched Team Leader Lang Huizhang, along with armed police officers, to the specified location. In a secret room, they found a small rainbow of raw materials for red pills, approximately several dozen kilograms, eight small packets of morphine, heroin, and other narcotics, as well as opium pipes and trays. They also apprehended important suspects Gao Buyuan and You Ganchen, as well as six monks and young novices from the temple: De Feng, Jiang Zhaofu, Jia Jiren, Jia Xiangjun, and Sun Jincai, all of whom were taken to the bureau. The main suspect, Chu Ping, took the opportunity to escape and hide in the home of a Zhang family in Nanmen. The bureau discovered this and sent officers to arrest him. During interrogation, he confessed to the sales. Furthermore, at the home of Wang Dong, near the temple, sixty packets of red pills, totaling over six thousand pills, were found. According to Dong, Chu Ping had stored them there. The Public Security Bureau has reported this to the County Government for review.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Severe Drought in Lin'an County <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the county has not received a drop of rain, and the drought has lasted for more than two months. Recently, there have been occasional drizzles, but they stop as soon as they start, providing little benefit. Of the four districts in the county, it is reported that only about six-tenths of the seedlings have been planted, and they appear withered and stunted, barely reaching a foot in height. The vast fields of parched seedlings could easily be set ablaze. The unplanted rice paddies are cracked and fissured, the soil as hard as brick. Moreover, the major streams have dried up, and the deep wells are depleted. Residents near the mountains must travel three to five li to find spring water for drinking. The demand for water is even greater in the city, where people form lines for three to four hours, vying for water, with latecomers often finding none. The water is sometimes extremely dirty and foul-smelling, but it is better than nothing. Even household ponds and small wells have been almost completely drained. As a result, the people are in a state of anxiety and panic. The farmers, gaunt and emaciated, spend their days gazing at the sky, hoping for rain, their faces full of despair, leaving one wanting to cry. Although there was a slight drizzle a few days ago, it was of no help. However, water is seeping into the streams and wells, making the water cleaner to drink. As for the fields, the small amount of water is not even enough to moisten the soil. According to experienced farmers, if there is heavy rain within the next three to five days, there may be a thirty to forty percent chance of saving the crops; otherwise, this year's autumn harvest is doomed.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Robbers Kill Farmer in Huzhou <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>In the Caojia Hui area, north of the city, lived a farmer named Ling Changsheng, who enjoyed a modest prosperity, making him a target for bandits. He had been robbed five or six times in the past three years. Unexpectedly, at approximately 1:00 AM on the 8th of this month, more than ten bandits, each armed with guns, broke down the door and entered, searching at will. They stole more than thirty articles of clothing and over one hundred yuan in cash. When Ling Changsheng saw the bandits enter, he immediately climbed onto the roof and beat a gong, but he was shot by the bandits, the bullet piercing his abdomen. He fell from the roof and died instantly. Afterward, Ling's son, A Fa, came to Huzhou to report the incident to the court. After the court report, yesterday at around 10:00 AM, officials were dispatched to the village to conduct an investigation.</p>

China's proposal has been handed over by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Hu Shize, the minister to Switzerland, to be delivered to Guo Qinqi, the chief representative of China and minister to Britain, so that it can be submitted at the appropriate time. A Central News Agency reporter learned from diplomatic circles yesterday morning that the content of the proposal remains consistent with China's original position on the issue of puppet organizations, firmly denying them without any changes. The Chinese authorities also believe that the terms of the League of Nations General Assembly council members and non-permanent council members have expired and will be re-elected at this session. Therefore, China hopes to be re-elected as a non-permanent council member.</p>

Yesterday, Shanghai received a telegram stating that the Belgian King's special envoy, Lord Johnson, is expected to arrive in Shanghai by ship at 4:00 PM today. He will disembark at the Blue Funnel Line pier in Pudong. The Belgian Consulate in Shanghai and the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send representatives to the pier to welcome him at that time.

<p>Yan Will Stay in Shanghai for a Few Days Before Returning to Qingdao</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing, the Chinese ambassador to Russia, and his wife, former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, members of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board of Directors Zeng Rongfu and Masiel, etc., arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhou'an ship. The ship was delayed due to encountering a storm en route, arriving in Shanghai at 12:40 PM yesterday. Details of Yan and others' arrival in Shanghai, and their remarks to reporters from various newspapers, are as follows:</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Pu'an ship, on which Yan and others were traveling, arrived in Shanghai at 12:40 PM yesterday and docked at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Chinese Wharf in Pudong. They transferred to small boats to disembark at the Xinkuan Wharf. At that time, friends and relatives of Yan and Wang in Shanghai went to welcome them. After arriving in Shanghai, Yan and his wife went directly to the New Asia Hotel to stay, while Wang and the others</p>

<p>According to Yan's remarks on the ship yesterday, his visit to Shanghai is because his youngest daughter is scheduled to go to the United States in mid-month to study, and he has come specifically to see her off. There is no other mission. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days before returning to Qingdao to rest. It is still undecided whether he will go to Nanjing to meet Wang Jingwei before returning to Qingdao, as Premier Wang has gone to Jiangxi and must wait for his return to Nanjing before deciding. He does not intend to go to Lushan for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Temporarily Not Returning to Post <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Due to his advanced age and poor health, he intended to resign from his position as ambassador to Russia this past spring after returning to China from Russia, in order to recuperate. However, Premier Wang and others strongly persuaded him to stay, allowing him to take a temporary leave of absence but not approving his resignation. He plans to go to Peking in early next month to visit the Union Medical College Hospital for a check-up. Therefore, it is still undecided when he will go abroad to Russia to resume his post.</p>

<p>Reporters then asked Yan about the recent situation between Japan and Russia. He said that it is difficult to predict the current situation between Japan and Russia. Since the Disarmament Conference failed to produce results, all countries are doing their best to expand their military preparations. Under these circumstances, the future of the world situation is still uncertain.</p>

<p>Regarding the reports in foreign newspapers that figures in the British and American diplomatic circles, such as Song Ziwen, a member of the Economic Committee; Yan Huiqing, the ambassador to Russia; and Gu Weijun, the minister to France, had consulted on diplomatic matters in Qingdao in order to contribute to the central government's adoption, Yan said yesterday that this statement is completely unfounded. They were all in Qingdao for summer vacation and went separately, never even meeting to discuss diplomatic issues.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi flew to Jiangxi from Hongqiao Airport at 6:00 AM yesterday on a Ford airplane specially dispatched by Chairman Jiang to welcome him, as he needed to rush to Lushan to meet with Jiang, Wang, Huang, and others to discuss important internal and external policies.

<p>Said There are No Important Meetings in Lushan</p>
<p>Huang Will Return North to See Wang and Jiang Before Deciding</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Tang Youren, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai at 7:20 AM yesterday by night express train from Nanjing. Ju Zheng, the President of the Judicial Yuan, also arrived in Shanghai on the same train. They each returned to their private residences to rest. A Central News Agency reporter visited Tang at his residence yesterday morning, and he answered the reporter's questions as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Ambassador Yan Postpones Returning to His Post <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Tang first said that Yan Huiqing, the Chinese ambassador to Soviet Russia, has requested leave to return to China for almost half a year, and the date of his return to his post has not yet been decided. This is because Dr. Yan is currently suffering from heart disease, and after medical diagnosis, it is said that he should not live in a cold climate. The climate in Russia is very cold, even more so than in China, so it is planned to postpone his return to his post. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet learned whether Yan will go to Lushan to pay his respects to Premier Wang Jingwei and Chairman Jiang Jieshi after arriving in Shanghai from Qingdao today.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Ambassador Liu Recalled to China <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wendao, the minister to Italy, has already returned to China on the Italian shipping company's Conte Rosso, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai around September 4. Minister Liu's return to China was by telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because Liu has been serving abroad for five or six years without returning to China, so he was specifically recalled to inquire about the situation abroad, and Liu can also take this opportunity to return to his hometown, visit his relatives, and inspect the people's conditions in the country.</p>

<p>Tang continued that Premier Wang Jingwei and Minister Kong Xiangxi went to Jiangxi this time to attend a speech to the military officers' training corps, and political issues may be discussed during the meeting. It is not true that an important meeting is being held in Lushan. Premier Wang is scheduled to return to Nanjing in a few days. As for Huang Fu, the chairman of the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee of the Executive Yuan stationed in Peiping, due to the thorny negotiations on the aftermath of the war in North China, he expressed his resignation. Although Huang's attitude is not yet clear, it is hoped that he will cancel his intention to resign and decide the date of his return north after meeting with Wang and Jiang.</p>
<p>The United States Increases the Price of Silver</p>
<h3 id="e145">Hinders Our Foreign Trade <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>He Bingxian and Jin Guoshi Share the Same View</p>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, after the United States implemented its silver policy, the price of silver has been rising steadily, and its impact on China's financial and industrial sectors is becoming increasingly serious. A Shenshi News Agency reporter visited He Bingxian, the director of the International Trade Bureau, and Jin Guobao, a banker, and asked for their opinions. Both agreed that China's export trade would inevitably suffer a major blow. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e146">He Bingxian Talks About the Impact on Trade <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>According to He Bingxian, the director of the International Trade Bureau, the recent increase in the price of silver in the United States has led to a large outflow of silver from China. In theory, a large outflow of silver will inevitably lead to financial chaos and a decline in paper money, which will have a significant impact on the monetary system. However, judging from the current situation, it is difficult to predict whether there will be such a danger in the future, as the increase in the price of silver in the United States has not yet significantly affected China. However, the increase in the price of silver will definitely have a major adverse effect on China's foreign trade, which can be determined. When the price of silver was not increased, China bought foreign goods with silver at a very high price, and foreigners bought Chinese goods with gold at a very low value. Under this situation, China's exports of goods were more than imports of foreign goods, which could be offset to a considerable extent. Now that the price of silver has increased, because China uses high-priced silver,</p>
<p>China's Grass Cloth Should be at a Minimum</p>
<h3 id="e147">Have the Same Tax Rate as Japanese Cotton Cloth <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Grass Cloth Guild Submits a Request</p>
<p>Premier Wang Negotiates with Japan</p>
<p>Weng Qifan, chairman of the Sichuan Grass Cloth Industry Association in Shanghai, submitted a document to Premier Wang stating that grass cloth sold to Korea and Japan is subject to high taxes. He presented his views in order to negotiate and achieve the principle of reciprocity. The association previously read the Customs' announcement of the tax exemption order for grass cloth, which shows that the court loves domestic goods, encourages exports, and has good policies and benevolence. They did not dare not praise it. After reading the July 14th report, Minister Kong talked about the government revising the import tariff, specifically hiring experts to study it. Although the tariff on Japanese goods was reduced, the reason was for the sake of reciprocity. For example, Japan levies high taxes on grass cloth, and without this, it would not be possible to demand a reduction. This is because the court is seeking to establish a position for domestic goods and promote overseas trade, not hesitating to exchange huge benefits, especially for grass cloth. All hundreds of thousands of businessmen in the grass cloth industry are deeply grateful. After checking, China's new import tariff has already been promulgated and implemented, but Japan has not reduced its tax on Chinese grass cloth, and the court has not clearly expressed it, meaning that it is still under negotiation. The association's grass cloth has been sold in Korea for the longest time. In the past, Japan levied taxes in four grades: 18 yuan per 100 jin for top rough cloth, 21 yuan for rough cloth, 32 yuan for slightly fine cloth, and 40 yuan for fine cloth. Later, seeing the development of the grass cloth sales market, it implemented a tax increase in the 16th year of the Republic of China: 22 yuan per 100 jin for top rough cloth, 34 yuan for rough cloth, 52 yuan for slightly fine cloth, and 72 yuan for fine cloth. The industry suffered a lot from the high tax, and the losses were not small. Then came the Korean riots, and the direct and indirect losses were even greater. The industry was almost paralyzed. In the year before last, the country used the excuse that fine cloth was 19 inches wide and increased the tax by 35%. Last summer, the rough cloth was also increased by 35%. Now, the tax paid per 100 jin of top rough cloth is 32 yuan and 40 cents, 45 yuan and 90 cents for rough cloth, 70 yuan and 2 cents for slightly fine cloth, and 97 yuan and 20 cents for fine cloth, which is almost 100% of the value, making it the most burdensome tax in the world. In the past, during the peak sales era, Sichuan grass cloth reached 2 million yuan, and Jiangxi grass cloth doubled it. In recent years, the total grass cloth from Jiangxi and Sichuan provinces is less than 1 million yuan. Once the industry is unable to bear the losses, it will stop operating there. Now, fortunately, the court is considering the difficulties of merchants, revising the reciprocal trade agreement, and focusing on grass cloth tax reduction, which may provide a glimmer of hope. After checking, China has reduced taxes on many Japanese imports. China only sells one type of product in Korea, which is grass cloth. At a minimum, it must follow the same tax rate as the country's cotton cloth in order to be consistent with the principle of reciprocity. Otherwise, reciprocity is in name only, and burdensome taxation is in reality. Economic aggression is the common practice. The court has deep thoughts and far-reaching plans, and its diplomatic negotiations have a plan in mind, which does not need to be disturbed by the association's knowledge. However, the association's business of grass cloth is of great concern, and it cannot help but speak out. It offers its humble advice, and the court is invited to adopt it. The ability of grass cloth to develop in overseas trade in the future is based on this negotiation. Please strive for public reason and be fearless, and only after achieving the goal of reciprocity will it be over. If there is something appropriate, please follow the instructions. Respectfully submitted to President Wang of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, Chairman Weng Qifan of the Sichuan Grass Cloth Industry Association in Shanghai.</p>
<p>the foreign goods purchased at low prices will inevitably increase, and the foreigners who buy my valuable domestic goods with low-priced gold will inevitably decrease. Therefore, China's foreign trade has a great relationship with the US silver price increase policy.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Jin Guobao Expresses Pessimism <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>According to economic expert Jin Guobao, opinions among Chinese economists are divided on the advantages and disadvantages of increasing the price of silver for China. However, based on his personal observations, he feels that increasing the price of silver is actually detrimental to China. The United States has adopted an expansionary policy, buying up silver from various countries around the world. Based on the current price of silver, the New York market is already higher than China. China's silver reserves will inevitably flow out, resulting in a contraction of China's currency supply. At the same time, it will also affect the decline in China's prices. With this cycle, China's rural economy will inevitably be greatly disrupted. In addition, China's emerging industrial products will inevitably be affected by the silver price increase, making them unable to be exported, while foreign goods can continue to flow in. In this situation, the amount of import surplus will definitely increase, and the number of silver outflows will also increase accordingly. Therefore, if the US silver policy continues to be implemented, China's financial and industrial markets will definitely feel great anxiety.</p>
<p>In This City</p>
<h3 id="e149">Property Tax Slightly Increased <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Collected at 12 Percent of the Rent</p>
<p>Decision to Implement from the Winter of This Year</p>
<p>According to a responsible person from the city's Finance Bureau, Shanghai is a world-famous city and must have considerable basic municipal facilities. In recent years, efforts have been made to implement the Greater Shanghai Plan, and efforts should be made to realize it. However, striving to realize it, construction is the priority. As construction projects increase day by day, the costs and maintenance costs are also increasing day by day. According to the habits of civilized society, this cost should be borne separately by the citizens. This is the right and obligation that citizens should enjoy, and the principle is very clear and simple. It is found that the property tax is a major source of income for the city. The property tax rate for residents has only been collected at 10 percent. Therefore, it is necessary to increase it appropriately. After being approved by the central government, the city's property tax for residents will be changed to 12 percent of the rent, which will still be borne half by the owner and half by the tenant. The increased amount of tax will only be used to inject funds into the above-mentioned municipal facilities. However, the increased tax rate is also very fair. The patrol tax collected in the special zone is 13 percent in the French Concession and 14 percent in the Public Concession. 12 percent for road sections built beyond the boundary are all borne entirely by the tenant. In terms of the tenant's burden, the city is still several times away from the special zone. Before the 18th year of the Republic of China, during the era of collecting general taxes, the property tax rate for residents was 6 percent, which was completely paid by the tenant. Now, 12 percent is collected, and the landlord and tenant each pay half, so the tenant only pays 6 percent. This new tax rate was originally approved from this year (ie July).</p>

<p>Chairman Chen Guangfu first reported that regarding Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law, which requires one-quarter of the total deposit amount to be equivalent to government bonds and treasury bills to be deposited with the Central Bank for safekeeping, after submitting a request to postpone its implementation until the entire Savings Bank Law is revised, the order has now been received, and there is no need to object. The discussion then began. There was unanimous agreement on the principle of the law. However, the type, quantity, and safekeeping of collateral property, as well as how to implement it, should be properly planned. On the spot, it was decided to appoint five people, including Hu Xijun and Qu Jigang, to form a subcommittee to study it. After the study, it will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM. It is reported that the subcommittee meeting is scheduled to be held on the 13th of this month to study it.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Various Banks All Agree to the Revision <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the banking community yesterday that regarding the Savings Bank Law, after the Bankers Association submitted reasons for revision, according to the resolution of the tea party of member and non-member banks, the association sent the original manuscript submitted to the Yuan Ministry to various non-member banks on the 9th of this month to solicit opinions. The deadline was last night. Replies have been received from more than 40 banks, including Coal Industry, Dazhong, and Jianghai, all of which unanimously agreed. The association decided to start today next week, immediately make a formal presentation and send it to various non-member banks for stamping, and then submit it to the Yuan Ministry to request revision.</p>
<p>from the beginning of the implementation, but because various procedures have not yet been completed, it was decided to collect it at the new tax rate from winter. As for the property tax for shopkeepers, it will still be collected at the old rate of 14 percent.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Gu Xinyi, the chairman of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, went to Peking some time ago to attend the People's Food Design Committee meeting and returned to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter visited Gu, who said the following:</p>
<h3 id="e155">Food Control Should Start with Investigation <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The discussion at the People's Food Design Committee meeting was on how to actively promote the establishment of the Food Control Committee. At present, it will start from three aspects: production investigation and management. Before the Control Committee of the Yuan is established, all of the investigation work will be cumbersome and take a long time. Therefore, it will be handled by the Agricultural Affairs Investigation Institute of the Ministry of Industry first. However, the investigation matters require a lot of expenses. It is difficult to determine how the funds will be raised in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e156">The Transportation and Sales Bureau to Begin Preparations <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the establishment of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, given the current situation, it is indeed urgently necessary to establish it. Once Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi returns to Beijing from Gan, preparations can begin. As for the bureau's funding, the Central Bank will temporarily allocate loans. After the bureau is established, it will be temporarily directly under the Ministry of Finance. However, the nature of the bureau is closely related to the Grain Control Committee, so after the Grain Control Committee is established, the bureau will still be under the jurisdiction of the Control Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Rice Prices Will Not Continue to Rise Sharply <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the banking sector and the rice industry in this city have purchased a large quantity of foreign rice, aiming to suppress rice prices. Now, new rice has already entered the market, so according to current observations, rice prices should not continue to rise sharply. Within a few days, another 10,000 bags of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai. Regarding the tax exemption matter, the Shanghai Municipal Government has already consulted with the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to jointly petition the Executive Yuan for approval. Hunan can still supply surplus grain to other provinces this year. Although Anhui currently prohibits the export of rice and grain, the ban will be lifted in a week, so it has little impact on the market.</p>

<p>The General Federation of Industry Telegraphs the Guangdong Province</p>
<h3 id="e158">Cancel Special Tax on Domestic Goods <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Number of Foreign Factories Can Be Counted on Fingers</p>
<p>Imposing a General Tax Is No Different from a Likin</p>
<p>The Chinese General Federation of Industry yesterday telegraphed Guangdong Province, requesting the cancellation of the special tax on domestic goods entering the province. The original telegram stated: "Southwest Political Committee, Guangdong Provincial Government, greetings. Recently, it has been heard that the industrial and commercial sectors of your province are using the excuse that Shanghai factories have a large number of foreign investments and are dumping goods in Guangdong to vigorously advocate that the authorities implement taxation to protect the province's industry. It is also heard that local chambers of commerce have been convened to discuss and decide to establish a bureau to collect special taxes on imported goods and goods entering the province from other provinces. It is found that Shanghai is a trading port of our country, and it is inevitable that foreign merchants will set up factories in Shanghai. According to what our association knows, only the textile and cigarette industries in Shanghai have a slight advantage. Under the competition and struggle of domestic goods in other industries, they have gradually declined, and their numbers are already less than one-twentieth of domestic factories. Whether it is Chinese or Western, not only the competent authorities know in detail, but also the people of the whole country know clearly. However, the industrial and commercial sectors of your province do not pay attention and take the opportunity to demand an increase in the import tax from other provinces. After a little investigation of this proposal, it is known that it is a special tax in name, but a likin in reality. Once implemented, domestic goods will inevitably be destroyed. Since our country has had tariff autonomy, all domestically produced machine-made foreign-style goods are mostly only subject to transit taxes, and no other taxes are levied. Now, your province has added a special tax to prevent the dumping of goods from various provinces and protect the province's industry and commerce, which is a general term that does not distinguish between Chinese and foreign. Therefore, our association believes that this measure can only be applied to foreign goods, and domestic goods should not be treated the same way. Otherwise, the industrial products of all ports in the country will inevitably be unable to be sold in Guangdong Province due to heavy taxes, which will affect the industry, not just Shanghai. Moreover, if your province takes the lead, other provinces will inevitably follow suit, rejecting each other, and few will not perish together. Our association is the general hub of national industry and bears the mission of leading and safeguarding domestic industry. We dare to represent the national industry and telegraph to your association to cancel the proposal to collect special taxes on domestic goods, in order to save domestic factories from the brink of danger. I am extremely grateful. Chinese General Federation of Industry."</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Factories Telegraph Guangdong Provincial Government</p>
<h3 id="e159">Exemption from Special Tax on Domestic Goods <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Match Stick Factories Appeal for Support</p>
<p>The Shanghai Domestic Goods Factories Association yesterday telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Government, stating that, according to a letter from a member, the Jiuji Match Stick Factory, the Guangzhou sales office stated that Guangzhou is currently experiencing industrial and commercial depression. The authorities convened a meeting of city merchants to discuss countermeasures for maintenance. It was decided to implement a plan to establish a bureau to collect special taxes on imported goods and goods entering the province from other provinces, such as paints, cosmetics, enamel, copper, iron, hardware, rubber, matches, match sticks, etc., are all included in the collection. (Omission)... It is found that match sticks were all Japanese goods ten years ago. Later, domestic match stick and box factories were successively opened, and the stick pieces of domestic match factories were barely self-sufficient. The raw materials for the sticks are Yang wood from Yanzhou and Jining in Shandong and Tonghai in Jiangsu, and the box pieces are pine wood from Taizhou in Zhejiang. In the past two years, the price of Japanese goods has fallen and been dumped, which has greatly affected match factories. The stocks of stick wood factories have been piled up like mountains, resulting in some factories being completely shut down, and some factories operating at half capacity. They are now requesting government relief. It was previously reported that your province is collecting special import taxes on foreign goods to resist the dumping of foreign goods. For domestic goods, which are also in a leaky boat in the wind and rain, it is not likely to make a decision to increase the burden on domestic goods. Now, according to the previous situation, the situation of the stick wood factory being affected by the dumping of Japanese goods and being in imminent danger is telegraphed to your government for review and approval. Please protect and maintain it in order to maintain the lifeline of domestic goods, which is truly convenient.</p>
<p>Yellow Car Company</p>
<h3 id="e160">Drivers on Strike Yesterday <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Above Put Forward Four Demands</p>
<p>Dagon Gazette: The Yellow Car Company, a Chinese-owned business, has its main station at 534 Avenue Dubail in the French Concession, and has branch stations at seven locations, including Avenue de la Gare, Suzhou Road, Yuyuan Road, the Bund, Route Pichon, Avenue Edward VII, and Route Frelupt. It has a total of 56 cars and employs 133 regular and deputy drivers. Recently, due to dissatisfaction with the company's treatment, they suddenly announced a joint strike at 1 a.m. yesterday and went to the Car Drivers' Union on Mingguo Road for a meeting to put forward their demands and request assistance from party and government agencies. Therefore, the company's business has been completely suspended since yesterday morning.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Reasons for the Labor Dispute <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>According to the statement of all the drivers of the Yellow Car Company, the reasons for the labor dispute are as follows: (1) In January of this year, worker Zhou Yintai knocked down a pedestrian on Zhabei South Bridge. After the company investigated the matter, it was found that the fault belonged to the pedestrian. All compensation for damages had already been admitted and paid by the company itself, but it went back on its word afterwards and still made Zhou Yintai bear the responsibility himself, which was unfair. Also, worker Wang Langen damaged a vehicle on Fuxu Road last month. The damaged part was old, but the company ordered compensation for the new value, which was also unfair. (2) Workers Chi Miaogen, Zhou Huicheng, and Yan Asan had already handed over the passenger signature slips to the relevant staff. Later, the relevant staff carelessly lost the signature slips. The company ordered the above three people to compensate for the fares listed on the signature slips. (3) The company's current business is more prosperous than before, with monthly revenue of over 20,000 yuan, but the workers' wages have fallen as before, making it difficult to live. (4) There is no rest time for day and night service, and the workers are mentally exhausted and prone to accidents. (5) Workers Lu Xincai, Chen Jinshi, Ren Changshan, and others were fired by the company for trivial matters. (6) The company's newly promulgated Article 5, Article 18, and Article 22 of the Driver Service Regulations are too oppressive to the workers. (7) Workers' jobs are too insecure. (8) Workers' lives are too harsh.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Four Demands <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>After all the workers went on strike, they put forward the following four demands: (1) The company should immediately return the compensation paid by Chi Miaogen for the fares listed on the lost signature slips. Zhou Huicheng and Yan Asan should be exempted from the responsibility of paying the same compensation. (2) Reinstate Lu Xincai, Chen Jinshi, Ren Changshan, and other three workers. (3) Revise the newly promulgated Driver Service Regulations. (4) Improve all treatment and sign treatment conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Company Statement <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>A Dagon Gazette reporter went to the company's main station on Avenue Dubail yesterday afternoon to interview Manager Lin Zhongming, who said that the truth of the workers' sudden strike was completely unclear. Since the strike, no representatives have been sent to contact the company or put forward any demands. Now that the labor dispute has occurred, we can only wait for the party and government agencies to deal with it according to law. However, we hope that the workers will not go to extremes for the sake of labor-management cooperation. The company has prepared a memorial to request the municipal party department and the Social Affairs Bureau to handle it.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Party Department Investigation <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Upon receiving the report, the Municipal Party Department attached great importance to the strike at the Yellow Car Company because it concerned local transportation. The investigation section immediately sent a cadre, Yu Yaoqiu, to the company and the workers to investigate the truth and report it for approval. It was also decided that the Civil Affairs Section of the Party Department would join the Social Affairs Bureau tomorrow to summon both parties to mediate according to law, so as to avoid prolonged disputes and losses to both parties.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Rickshaw Dispute Ends <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>All Vehicles Released, Rickshaw Drivers Operate as Usual</p>
<p>Court Adjourns Hearing Yesterday, Continuing Interrogation at a Later Date</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that some rickshaw drivers in the Public Concession were dissatisfied with the solution reached by the Car Committee and the car dealers, which caused disturbances on the streets on the 9th and 10th of the month. After the police arrested them strictly, the situation returned to normal yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e166">Return to Normal <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>On the 9th and 10th, some rickshaw drivers, using the excuse that the Municipal Council and the car dealers had compromised on revising the new regulations, oppressed the rickshaw drivers, so they blocked rickshaws on the streets and deflated the tires, carrying out sabotage. The Municipal Council believed that this behavior of the rickshaw drivers not only hindered traffic, but also incited strikes and disrupted public order, so it ordered the police stations to strictly arrest them and arrested the main actors, Zheng Fazhu, Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, and others one after another. The rickshaw drivers who went to the Car Committee to petition on the 9th held a temporary emergency meeting on Xiaoshadu Road on the evening of the 10th and sent 40 representatives to various roads to persuade them to stop the damage. Therefore, all the vehicles of the car owners were released as usual yesterday, and the rickshaw drivers also operated as usual with peace of mind.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Court Hearing <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The police authorities learned that the leaders of this incident were Jiangbei natives Zheng Fazhu and others, so the Chinese and Western detectives of the Political Department went to arrest the representatives of the association, Zheng Fazhu, Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, Cang Gongsen, and Xing Hongxi, and detained them in the Putuo Road police station. They were sent to the Criminal Division 2 of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The lawyer representing the police station rose and described the case in detail, saying that the police station is currently prosecuting Zheng Fazhu, Zhu Fengxiang, and Cang Gongwen for the crime of obstructing freedom under Articles 318 and 319 of the Criminal Law, but in the future, it may be necessary to add the crime of damage under Article 382 of the Criminal Law. The remaining Cang and Xing are not prosecuted for the time being, and they are requested to be detained. From the previous two days, a strike broke out among rickshaw drivers in the Public Concession, and they blocked rickshaws along the way, removing screws and deflating tires, making them unable to drive. After detailed investigation by the police station, it was learned that the five defendants in this case were the backbone of the initiators. They reported to the court and obtained arrest warrants at 11:30 last night to arrest the five people. Because the Municipal Council, according to the report of Gu Songmao, chairman of the Car Dealers Association, said that the rickshaws released in the past three days could not collect their rent, or the vehicles were destroyed, and they could not operate. Please find a way to protect them. While the police station was investigating, the five defendants served as representatives of 300 rickshaw drivers to petition the Political Department of the Municipal Council, demanding rent reduction. They thought the result was satisfactory and left, but soon the defendants held white flags and rioted along the way, deflating the tires and destroying the vehicles. Then they rushed to the wasteland on Rue Robert and gathered to hold a meeting, shouting slogans to overthrow the car owners, so that the rickshaw drivers would not pay rent and the car owners would not be able to operate. Therefore, the police station arrested Zheng and others. A ledger and leaflets were seized from Zhu Fengxiang's side. The ledger had the words "pay three corners" on it. According to the police station's speculation, rickshaw drivers who joined the strike and took charge of deflating tires were given three corners of foreign money every day. As for the leaflets, there were more than 20 initiators, and all five defendants were listed on them, specializing in sabotage. However, the content of this case is complicated, and the police station has not yet investigated it in detail, and requested permission to adjourn the hearing. The lawyer representing the Car Dealers Association stated that about 700 or 800 vehicles have been destroyed in recent days, with losses exceeding 10,000, so they filed a private prosecution. They agreed to the postponement of the hearing. When asked, the defendant Zheng Fazhu confessed that he runs a rickshaw shop with 20 rickshaws, and believes that he is a representative of the rent reduction meeting. He was the chairman of the meeting held on Rue Robert yesterday, but he advised the rickshaw drivers to wait patiently for a solution and not to take any out-of-bounds actions, and organized a persuasion team to persuade the rickshaw drivers to resume work at 9 a.m. this morning. There were police detectives and newspaper reporters at the scene to witness this. As for the leaflets, I don't know about them, I think they were fabricated by villains. When questioned, the other four, Zhu Fengxiang and others, only admitted to being representatives of the rent reduction meeting and denied sabotage. Finally, Gu Songmao, a member of the Car Dealers Association, complained about the situation. After Zhan Liangce presented the verified confession, he ordered Zheng and the other five to be taken back into custody and to be interrogated again in seven days.</p>
<p>Su Farmers Bank</p>
<h3 id="e168">Promoting Cooperative Sales <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Sending Personnel to Organize Associations in Various Places</p>
<p>Planning to Establish Sales Branches</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, in view of the fact that rural finance has been exhausted and the economy has collapsed in various places in recent years, the biggest reason is that the agricultural products of various places are stagnant in the countryside and cannot be directly transported and sold to major cities. If we can find a way to facilitate transportation and sales, then rural finance can be circulated and circulated immediately, and farmers' income can be increased invisibly. Therefore, the bank has recently been actively promoting cooperative transportation and sales and has spared no effort. Since the opening of the Shanghai "Cooperative Agricultural Products Transportation and Sales Office" of the bank this spring, it has received commissions from cooperative societies and other organizations in various places almost every day to transport and sell rice, wheat, cotton yarn, native cloth, daylily, and purchase bean cake, fertilizer, diesel, etc. Recently, it has also tried to act as an agent for livestock transportation and sales. Danyang, Qingjiangpu, Jingjiang, and Jintan have each entrusted batches of pigs to the office for transportation to Shanghai for sale. The procedures are simple and the results are quite good. According to the investigation of the Transportation and Sales Office, the selling price of rice, wheat, etc. transported and sold by farmers in various places as agents in the past is 30 cents to 50 cents higher per dan than the selling price near the towns in the place of origin, excluding transportation costs. According to the bank's calculation, if it acts as an agent for farmers to transport and sell 2 million dan of agricultural products this year, then the farmers in the province can invisibly increase their income by more than one million yuan this year. This kind of pioneering cooperative business has had remarkable results during the bank's trial period. It is heard that the bank has recently been more aggressive and has dispatched many investigators to designated business areas throughout the province to earnestly advocate organization and strive to promote various agricultural product transportation and sales cooperatives in order to expand the transportation and sales business. Those that have been established include the cotton production and sales cooperatives in Jiading, Changyinsha, Yancheng, and Funing, and the daylily production and sales cooperative and soybean production and sales cooperative in Suqian. Most of the other credit cooperatives that have a relationship with the Farmers Bank also兼operate in production and sales. At the same time, the bank is making every effort to expand agricultural warehouses in various places as a supplement to the transportation and sales business. It is also heard that the bank is planning to establish branches of the "Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Agricultural Products Transportation and Sales Office" in important grain distribution centers in the province in order to connect with the Shanghai Transportation and Sales Office and effectively seek benefits for farmers in various places.</p>

<p>Jinpu Railway Coal Car Derailment Delay</p>
<p>The Beiping No. 301 Shanghai-Beiping joint transportation special through train did not arrive in Shanghai until 4:40 p.m. yesterday. The reasons for the delay are as follows:</p>
<p>Coal Car Derailment: The Jinpu Railway No. 583 coal car suddenly derailed at Mingguang Station the day before yesterday afternoon. The station master immediately telegraphed the locomotive department to send a crane to rescue it. The overturned coal car was first lifted, but because the sleepers of the track had been damaged, they were immediately repaired. The repair was not completed until yesterday morning. The trains going down were all blocked at Bengbu Station and Chuzhou Station.</p>
<p>Delay of Various Trains: The No. 301 Shanghai-Beiping joint transportation express through train started from Beining Railway Beiping at 3:05 p.m. and arrived at Jinpu Railway Bengbu Station at 4:19 p.m. the day before yesterday. However, because the coal car derailed at Mingguang Station and had not been repaired, it was stopped at Bengbu Station. It did not start until yesterday morning after the repair was completed. It arrived at Nanjing Station of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway at 9 a.m. yesterday morning. It did not arrive at Shanghai North Station until 4:40 p.m. yesterday, a delay of nine hours.</p>

<p>Large Quantities Arriving in Beishi</p>
<p>New Sound News Agency reports that the price of rice in this city has exceeded the 13 yuan stipulated by the People's Food Conference due to manipulation. The municipal authorities have paid close attention to this. The Social Affairs Bureau specially sent Mr. Guo Shi, an official of the Fourth Section, to the Shanghai North Rice Industry Association, the Shanghai North Rice Grain Sales Association, the Shanghai North Rice Transportation Merchants Association, and the Shanghai South Rice Grain Association to investigate the situation and consult on everything with the leaders of the associations, Zhu Zixiang, Jiang Zisheng, and Jiang Shiya, and advised them to buy and sell at reasonable prices and restrict speculation and price increases. As for the new grains in various places, they will be harvested one after another. Recently, due to the slight stabilization of people's minds, 180 rice boats in Beishi have not sold their cargo, totaling more than 10,000 stones. The daily statistics of goods arriving in the North and South markets average more than 30 boats. However, the secret price is still 13 yuan and four corners.</p>

<p>New News Agency reports that Bradford, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, has returned to China after his vacation, which has expired, and has returned to work at the Customs yesterday.

<p>Steam Turbine Union Will Strive Again</p>
<h3 id="e174">Customs Patrol Boats Employ Chinese People <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Steam Turbine Union has previously stated that Customs patrol boats have always been monopolized by foreign guests, using foreigners who do not meet the qualifications of crew members and lack experience to hold positions, and the treatment is also very generous. Last month, the union requested the Customs to designate five newly built patrol boats to use Chinese crew members. It is now learned that the Inspector General of Customs has replied to the union by letter, insisting on his own views and not agreeing to the request. The union believes that the statements made by the Tax Commissioner are untrue and incomplete. Yesterday, based on the facts, it added a rebuttal and sent letters to the Customs Affairs Department for review. The original text states: "Dear Sir, I have received your letter of the 27th of last month regarding the employment of foreigners by our Customs Tax Affairs Department, infringing on our sovereignty, using similar people, filling positions indiscriminately, monopolizing patrol boats, and requesting the designation of five new boats to use Chinese crew members, so as to compete with foreigners. According to the letter, the sections are confused and untrue and incomplete. The matter concerns foreigners messing up the government, and we have no choice but to refute it. The analysis and defense are as follows: The employment of foreigners by the Customs Tax Affairs Department of our country is due to diplomatic relations. Over the years, they have controlled the actual power of finance and controlled our lives. With the respect of the government, the use of funds cannot be initiated unless they agree, which will cause other problems. This situation has become an open secret. The so-called since the 18th year, all Chinese personnel have the qualifications to be promoted to the highest rank. Although the rules and regulations are like this, the imperialists use the left, the middle, the Bible, the right, the white blade, conspiracy and tricks, deceiving people and deceiving the world, as their usual practice. If what they say is credible, if the Inspector General of Customs is replaced by a Chinese at present, I am afraid that the opposition will happen immediately. Moreover, the highest position in the Customs is the Inspector General of Customs, and whether your election to this position is based on the deepest qualifications and used as a means of advancement should be questioned. As for the Chinese members who are currently serving as tax commissioners, they have not yet been promoted to the highest rank at this time, and are still subject to foreigners. If they are said to be waiting to be selected and progressing gradually, it is no different from stealing chickens day by day and stealing one chicken a month. The words of deception are not as good as their own. The students trained by the tax school are drivers, not turbine members. According to what our association asked, the treatment of these students is the same as that of foreigners in the same position.</p>
<p>It is not equal and the newspaper advertisement is also a cover-up. The examiner is a foreigner. For all items such as physical fitness, knowledge and experience, he is critical of the Chinese and strives for perfection, while foreign crew members not only do not have to pass the exam, but only need blue eyes and a curly beard to be qualified and can be selected. However, your company still says that it has advertised for recruitment and has not yet obtained qualified Chinese members. This is not a sincere statement. Ten eyes are watching and ten hands are pointing. We have long known its tricks and do not need to be so articulate to confuse the hearing. The Customs is the Customs of the Republic of China, and foreign members are employees of the Republic of China. The sovereignty lies in the language and writing, which is naturally based on Chinese language and writing. However, because the Inspector General of Customs is a foreigner, it is appropriate to 洋奴化and has been a long-standing practice. The first prerequisite for selecting Chinese people has always been to be able to speak foreign languages and be able to communicate in foreign languages, which is also the greatest tool for excluding Chinese people and pointing out that they lack talent. The officials of the former Qing Dynasty were even more useless. Since Hurd, the foreign members of the Customs have inherited the mantle of dealing with the government and have been using the fact that the common people are afraid of officials and officials are afraid of foreigners for decades, which has been very harmful. Therefore, your company said that there are no suitable candidates for Chinese machinists, so you have to ask the government to re-employ qualified foreign machinists to serve. This is clearly manipulating things, using the government's name to oppress the Chinese. We must know that our knowledge is no longer comparable to that of the 19th century. Making false pretense is becoming less effective.</p>
<p>The facts are there and it is not appropriate to argue strongly. Words are better than reason, and they will eventually be ridiculed, and it is not necessarily able to win. As for the corruption and misconduct of foreign crew members, such as the chief mechanic of the old Meteor patrol boat, his physical condition is weak, just like the俗谚said of a "劳病鬼". You can imagine what the results will be. Your company did not dismiss him, but based on his report, fired the Chinese member, Lu. As they are both turbine personnel, Chinese people must be on probation for six months, while foreigners do not have this rule. Are all foreigners the best candidates? Within the scope of the Customs, there is only a distinction between Chinese and foreigners, and there is no public reason to speak of. Thieves hate their masters, which is not false. The three points mentioned above are just to defend against the sections mentioned in the letter. It is not easy to seek skin from a tiger, but our association is confident that the principle that Chinese people should serve as crew members on Customs patrol boats cannot be overthrown by any frivolous discussion. If it is said that the current crew members are full, then many of the members used by your office do not meet the qualifications of crew members and should be dismissed. As for the patrol boats currently being built in the dock, there are several more, and our association's proposal should be adopted to eliminate them and legally employ Chinese people. We should no longer use one-sided words to justify the crimes of concealment and protection. Our association's heart is to do good with others. If there is a change of heart, we will not overdo it. Correspondingly, we send this letter and ask you to check and see the reply for your荷</p>

<h3 id="e176">The Urgent Need for Disaster Relief in Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The China Relief Society recently received a telegram from Xu Saijia, director of the Jiangpu County Relief Center, stating: "Jiangpu has unfortunately suffered a devastating drought. Over 80% of the county has been affected. Ponds are dry, the countryside is cracked, and thousands of acres of fertile land have become scorched earth. The disaster is truly rare. Moreover, Jiangpu is known for its poverty, and farmers have little savings. Young adults are seeking a living and flocking to the city, while the elderly and weak beg for food and gather in the streets. What will young children do? Therefore, a temporary shelter for child victims has been established to provide accommodation and prevent them from becoming vagrants. However, funding is extremely tight, and this extraordinary disaster has further exacerbated the difficulty. How can we expand further? But since we are saving the lives of child victims, can we ignore their plight? Therefore, this special telegram is sent to request your generous assistance in providing relief funds and distributing charity grain. We eagerly await your response." Furthermore, according to a letter from Mr. Fu Erkan of the Congren Bureau in Anhui Province: "Anhui has not seen rain for two months since the beginning of summer. The land is cracked, and crops are withered. The drought is widespread, with people fleeing everywhere. The situation is dire. Moreover, after years of disaster and famine, and at a time when the rural economy is collapsing, the land is barren for miles. Is there anyone left alive? Now, in the villages, the elderly and weak are committing suicide daily. The situation is appalling and indescribable. There is nowhere to find food, and the future is bleak. Moreover, after a major disaster, epidemics often occur, and people die in piles. It is heartbreaking to witness. Therefore, I briefly report the circumstances and beg you to quickly organize relief efforts and widely publicize them, so that many hands can lighten the burden. If you have any medicine, please donate generously to help treat the disaster area." Based on these reports, the association faces a sluggish market and rural bankruptcy. Relief funds are depleted, and sighs are the only response. What good is it to just call out for help? However, 2,000 bottles of medicine have been allocated to be sent to Anhui to treat illnesses. The hungry are crying for food, and their lives are hanging by a thread. We can only appeal on their behalf, hoping that compassionate and kind people will lend a helping hand.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Two Red Pill Manufacturing Sites Uncovered <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Two establishments broken up consecutively on Tiantong Road</p>
<p>Owners Liu Deji and Huang Yuchu arrested</p>
<p>Zhou Honglin, Chief Investigator of the General Inspectorate of the General Police Department, learned that Cantonese men He Yucheng and Chen Awu were specializing in the sale of red pills. He ordered his officers to contact He and Chen, stating that each bag of 1,000 red pills should be sold for seven dollars. It was agreed to purchase ten bags, totaling seventy dollars. A deposit of thirty dollars was paid in advance, and the remaining balance was to be paid at Room 1, Changhua Hotel, Fujian Road, the day before yesterday. The red pills were to be delivered at the same time. At the appointed time, Chief Investigator Zhou immediately reported to Western Detective Chief Bai Po and collaborated with Chinese Detective Chief Song Bingzheng and Detective Bao Xie Futang to wait in ambush. However, He and Chen did not deliver the goods until 4:00 AM the day before yesterday, when they finally delivered ten bags of red pills, totaling 10,000 pills. They were immediately arrested by the detectives. Under questioning, He confessed that the manufacturing site was located upstairs at 47 Tiantong Road, Hongkou, at Baoguang Hospital, and the owner was Cantonese man Huang Zhen. The detectives went to the address, arrested Huang, and seized a large box of red pills, approximately 50,000 to 60,000 pills, as well as numerous raw materials and machinery for making red pills. They also found over one hundred dollars in banknotes in Huang's pockets and wallet, all proceeds from the sale of red pills. Among them were two ten-dollar bills and two five-dollar bills, which were the deposit paid by the police. The bills had been secretly marked. Huang also confessed that another manufacturing site was located upstairs at 415 Beijiangxi Road, Tiantong Road. The detectives continued the search and seized 324 taels of red pills, numerous raw materials, and machinery, and arrested worker Liu Shuisheng. Under questioning, he confessed that the owners of this den were Cantonese men Liu Deji and Huang Yuchu. They then went to 78 Tiantong Road and arrested Liu and Huang. They also learned that Deng Wencao, who resided at 117 on the same road, was also a shareholder, and he was arrested as well. In total, seven suspects were arrested, and approximately 100,000 red pills, as well as numerous raw materials and machinery, were seized. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian presented the case, prosecuted under Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law, and requested severe punishment. However, he requested leniency for He Yucheng, as his confession had led to the case being solved. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, questioned each defendant in detail and announced that the debate on the case was concluded, and the verdict would be announced next Thursday morning. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>The Money Shop Joint Reserve Deceived</p>
<p>Relationship with Zifeng Money Shop</p>
<p>The Money Shop Joint Reserve at 112 Xingcheng Lane, Ningbo Road, is an organization formed by various money shops in the city, specializing in the payment of funds for each shop. Each shop receives a check from the reserve. The check number issued to the Zifeng Money Shop at 5 Fucheng Lane, Tianjin Road, was number 59, while the check number issued to Baofeng Fuji Money Shop, which was affiliated with Zifeng, was number 71. On the 6th of this month, a man suddenly presented a check with number 71 of Baofeng, stamped with a seal, and withdrew 30,000 yuan in banknotes from the reserve. The reserve paid the money. However, it was later discovered that the check had been altered from Zifeng's number 59, and the Baofeng seal was forged. The reserve reported the incident to the General Police Department, requesting an investigation. The captain ordered Chinese Detective Chief Li Yidong and Detectives Geng Debiao and Huang Fusen to investigate. The detectives found that the banknotes issued by the reserve were all new ten-yuan and five-yuan notes from the Central Bank. The front of the notes had a red "泉" (Fountain) mark, and the back had a black "心" (Heart) mark. They investigated based on this point. It was found that a Shaoxing man named Li Jinshou deposited 4,000 yuan of banknotes with the above-mentioned marks at the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank on Ningbo Road at 4:00 PM on the 6th of this month. His occupation and address were listed as an employee of the Zifeng Money Shop. The detectives went to Zifeng the day before yesterday and arrested Li, bringing him back to the police station. Under questioning, he claimed that the money was given to him by his aunt for deposit, but he could not describe his aunt's appearance or address, only saying that she was a laundress. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian stated that the police were conducting a careful investigation into the inside story of the case and requested that the defendant be detained for investigation. Judge Qian Hongye questioned Li and approved his detention for one week. The content of the case is extremely complex. Once the truth is found, there will be many involved.</p>

<p>Funded by the Postal Savings Bureau</p>
<p>Construction to begin in early next month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Office of the Ministry of Communications plans to rebuild a new-style ten-story building on its original site at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Fuzhou Road, as the existing building is old. The site has an area of 1.97 mu and is the office's own property. In addition to a portion for its own use, the building will also house all Shanghai-based agencies affiliated with the Ministry of Communications for convenience. The plan has been approved by the Ministry of Communications, and all designs and models have been made. However, due to unresolved funding, it has been delayed until now. It is now learned that the funding has been invested by the Shanghai Postal Savings Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, so funding is no longer an issue. During the reconstruction period, the telegraph office will find another suitable location near the original site to connect the landlines and continue operations as usual. It is said that construction will officially begin in early next month.</p>

<p>Intermodal transportation contract signed yesterday</p>
<p>Intermodal passenger tickets valid for two days</p>
<p>The Nanjing Municipal Railway Administration sent personnel to negotiate intermodal passenger transportation with the Railway Bureau in September last year. It was initially planned to trial intermodal transportation of third and fourth-class passengers and baggage first. The Traffic Department and the Administration have now agreed on fourteen contract terms, which were formally signed yesterday (August 11). The full text is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e182">Intermodal Transportation Contract <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration and the Nanjing Municipal Railway Administration, intermodal transportation contract. (1) The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration and the Nanjing Municipal Railway Administration (hereinafter referred to as the Administration) have entered into this agreement to facilitate third and fourth-class passenger traffic between the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Nanjing Municipal Railway. (2) The scope of the intermodal transportation is limited to third and fourth-class passengers and their baggage.

<h3 id="e185">Adding One Floor to the Building <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Originally Eighteen Stories, Now One Story Added</p>
<p>The entire project can be completed in eighteen months</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications has invested 2 million yuan to build a new nineteen-story castle-style building at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road, opposite the Public Works Department, as the existing bank address on the Bund is insufficient. The building will be magnificent and imposing, standing alongside the Capital Hotel and the Hamilton House, but it will be taller, have a better appearance, and have more advanced facilities. The grand project is designed by Jianxing Architects, with Tonghe Foreign Firm participating as a consultant. The project is proceeding very carefully and has been contracted to Tao Guiji Construction Company. Construction has begun and is expected to be completed in eighteen months. It is said that due to the location of the building, it was originally planned to be eighteen stories, but with the approval of the Public Works Department, one more floor has been added, making it a nineteen-story building.</p>
<p>Japanese Department Store Bankrupt</p>
<h3 id="e186">Beifu Store Closes Down <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Impact of the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, the Beifu Department Store at the corner of Minhang Road and Miller Road suddenly closed down on the 9th. The store was operated by Kakuta Yoshitaro, president of Shanghai Xingye Co., Ltd., and was one of the largest stores selling Japanese goods in Shanghai. After the completion of the second Kakuta Building at the end of Showa 7 (two years ago), several rooms on the ground floor were used as a shopping mall. Since its opening, the number of customers has been increasing day by day. It was originally planned to expand business and move to the first Kakuta Building at the corner of Wen Road and Wusong Road, but the planned plan has been abandoned. The reason for the closure is that the glass factory operated by Kakuta on Yokohama Road, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, was destroyed during the Shanghai Incident, with losses of over one million yuan. After requesting direct damage certificates from the government, the relief funds allocated by the government were very small. The allocation rate was higher for those with less damage, and those with losses of over 5,000 yuan were disproportionately affected. Therefore, not only is it difficult for the glass industry to recover, but also the plans for revitalizing various aspects have been completely disappointed. In order to settle the debts for the revitalization, the store had to be closed. If the relief funds and existing goods are insufficient for disposal, the land base of the first Kakuta Building at the corner of Wusong Road and Wen Road will be sold. It is said that Kakuta's concern for property and credit is indeed a last resort.</p>

<p>For Eighteen Copper Coins</p>
<p>Suspicion Falls on a Monk</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 11th) morning, according to Cheng Youyu, a native of Danyang, together with Xu Shiying, the land guard of Shuangzi Thirteenth Ward, reported to the District Court that he was operating a sesame cake shop in Beida Street, Zhenru Town. He had parents in his hometown and a younger brother named Xiao Fugeng, who was fifteen years old this year. Xiao Fugeng came to Shanghai two years ago. Because of his young age, he had nothing to do, so he went out every day to sell sesame cakes on the street to supplement the family income. On the 6th of this month, at around 7:00 PM, Xiao Fugeng asked a tea customer named Monk A at Zhang Amao's teahouse in Houjiang for eighteen copper coins that were owed for the sesame cakes, but to no avail. An argument ensued. Then, Monk A asked Xiao Fugeng to go with him to get the money. He left and never returned. Because Xiao Fugeng did not return for several days, they were searching for him everywhere. Today, according to various newspapers, the body of an unidentified male, only ten years old, who had been strangled to death, was found in a ditch behind Yangjiaqiao and Jinan New Village in Zhenru (about three miles away from Cheng Youyu's sesame cake shop). The reporters immediately investigated the scene and confirmed that it was Xiao Fugeng. Therefore, they requested a coffin with the land guard to transport the body back to their hometown for burial and to apprehend the murderer. Yang Ruxiu, the prosecutor, summoned them and approved the delivery of the body, ordering a thorough search for the murderer. It was learned that Monk A had disappeared without a trace after the incident. Zhang Amao, the owner of the teahouse, was summoned by the police station and ordered to provide bail. The case involves only eighteen copper coins, but a life was taken with cruel means. It is truly unjust.</p>

The grand occasion in Russia was unprecedented. Now that the exhibition has closed, Xu and his wife will return to China on the Russian President steamship and will arrive in Shanghai on the 16th of this month. Xu's friends in Beijing and Shanghai have received telegrams stating that the trip was a great success and that he will devote his full efforts to promoting cultural exchange between China and Europe after returning home.

<p>Medical Group Meeting</p>
<h3 id="e190">Elephant Clam Monopoly and Soaring Prices <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Elephant clams, a medicinal material, are produced in Zhang Village, Yin County, Zhejiang Province, and sold in Shanghai, Shandong, and other places. The price has been no more than 30 to 40 yuan for many years. Since the establishment of the Elephant Clam Marketing Cooperative in the area, all elephant clams produced in the area have been exclusively sold by the cooperative, and private sales are not allowed. Violators will be punished, resulting in a gradual increase in prices. This year, the cooperative has further restricted production. The method is to prohibit the harvesting of elephant clams that should be unearthed in mid-April, abandoning them underground, resulting in Shanghai prices soaring to over 300 yuan per dan. Wang Yuandao Guoyao Pharmacy and Guo Hefan wrote to the National Medical Association, asking for joint efforts to stop this, so as to alleviate the burden on patients and prevent other drugs from doing the same. The National Medical Association referred it to the Special Committee for discussion. A meeting was held last night, attended by Guo Boliang, Zhang Zanchen, Sheng Xinru, Huang Baozhong, Lu Shie, Xia Zhongguang, Fu Yongyan, He Yunsheng, Yang Yanhe, Shen Xinjia, Cen Binghuan, Cen Zhiliang, Shi Jiqun, Ding Zhongying, Ren Nongxuan, Cheng Diren, Ding Jiwan, Xue Wenyuan, Xie Liheng, Yan Cangshan, Jiang Wenfang, Chinese National Medical Association, Shenzhou National Medical Association, Shanghai National Medical Association, and the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, all represented by delegates. Jiang Wenfang was elected chairman. All agreed that this kind of unreasonable artificial price increase would greatly increase the burden on patients. If the producing areas of various important Chinese medicines followed suit, it would further undermine the prosperity of Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine. It was decided on the spot: (1) Send a letter to the cooperative questioning the following points: 1. What is the cost per dan of elephant clams for farmers in the producing area? 2. What is the production volume of the cooperative over the years, and what is the production and sales situation this year? 3. Does the cooperative consider the contract signed with the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, etc., to be valid? 4. The price of elephant clams in Shanghai has risen to over 300 yuan per dan. Does the cooperative have any way to suppress the price? (2) Study alternative drugs for elephant clams to reduce the burden on patients. Lu Shie, Shi Jiqun, Cheng Diren, He Yunsheng, and Jiang Wenfang were invited to undertake the research. (3) Secret. (4) Secret.

<h3 id="e196">Change of General Manager of the World Book Company <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Shen Zhifang Replaced as Supervisor</p>
<p>The 13th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the World Book Company's head office on Dalian Bay Road in this city was convened on July 29. In addition to passing important resolutions, the election of directors and supervisors was held. The results of the ballot were as follows: The elected directors were Li Shizeng, Wu Yunzhai, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Jingjiang, Qian Xinzhi, Du Chongyuan, Chu Minyi, Lu Zhongliang, Jin Zhaoyan, Li Shuhua, Chen Hexian, Cui Zhuxi, Shen Zhifang, and Lu Gaoyi, totaling fifteen people. The elected supervisors were Wu Zhihui, Li Linyu, and Qi Zhongqing, totaling three people. The elected directors and supervisors of the company are mostly well-known figures of the time. This was reported in this newspaper on July 30. It is reported that the bureau held its first board meeting on the second floor of the General Distribution Office on Fuzhou Road on the 5th of this month and publicly elected Mr. Zhang Jingjiang as chairman of the board, and Li Shizeng, Wu Yunzhai, and Cui Zhuxi as executive directors. It is known that the book bureau was founded single-handedly by Mr. Shen Zhifang in the tenth year of the Republic. The initial scale was small, but in a few years, the business was quite extensive and developed rapidly. Shen devoted all his efforts to the company and made it one of the three major companies. In thirteen years, it has achieved such a scale. There is no other cultural undertaking that has risen to the same level. Recently, Mr. Shen, feeling that his age was increasing and his energy was declining, and he was overwhelmed by the heavy tasks, wrote to the board of directors requesting resignation. After deliberation by the board of directors, and facing Shen's insistence on resigning, it was decided to reluctantly grant approval after considering Shen's hard work for the company for more than ten years. It was also decided that Mr. Lu Gaoyi, the company's manager, should concurrently serve as general manager, and that Mr. Shen should be hired as the company's supervisor, working in the head office as usual. Both proposals were unanimously passed by the board of directors. It is reported that the company's board's announcement and letter of appointment were sent out yesterday (the 11th). On the same afternoon, the company's authorities convened a meeting of all colleagues. Executive Director Cui Zhuxi, Supervisor Wu Zhihui, and others all came to deliver speeches. Supervisor Shen Zhifang and Acting General Manager Lu Gaoyi both gave sincere speeches. Many colleagues also gave earnest speeches (the length of the speeches is omitted). The atmosphere of harmony and talent was prosperous.</p>
<p>Sailors Rescued by the Hairui Steamer</p>
<h3 id="e197">Are Boatmen from the Sinking Tongchangyuan Ship <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The Shandong Yizhou Prefecture Shijiuzhai Tongfeng Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Company recently loaded a large quantity of raw peanuts and raw oil, and sent four large sandboats to Shanghai. Among them, the Tongchangyuan sandboat was loaded with 200 bags of raw peanuts and 470 baskets of raw oil. It set sail at the same time as the three sandboats. The cargo on the Tongchangyuan ship was sent to Shanghai and delivered to the Senmao Company at Guanquai in Nanshi. After setting sail, at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, it encountered a hurricane on the Lvsi sea. When turning the boat, a large wave hit and sank the bow of the boat. Two more waves came, and the boat capsized. The fourth wave broke the sandboat, and all the cargo and boatmen fell into the sea. The area is located on the Dashachang sea, north of Sheshan. At that time, the China Merchants Bureau's Hairui steamer happened to sail to the Lvsi sea. At that time, the second mate Yang Biru was on duty. The helmsman first saw people drifting on the sea and reported to the chief mate Qian Yujia. Qian immediately ordered the ship to stop and lower the gangplank to the sea. He rescued two people holding on to the mast onto the ship. Six people were found holding on to broken wooden boards at the bow of the ship and were also rescued. It was said that there were still seven people in the sea. The sampan searched for two hours but did not find them. They had probably drowned. The rescued people had been drifting for two days and two nights without food. Their bodies were pale. If they had not been rescued, they would have died. The ship provided them with drinks, clothes, and medical treatment. Among them was Sun Xinhe, 65 years old, nicknamed Xiaotian, who was the owner of the Tongchangyuan sandboat. He kowtowed to the ships. Sun said that he had been sailing this sandboat for 39 years. This time, he loaded cargo to Shanghai, and was sunk by the strong wind. He did not take anything from the boat, only the statue of the Goddess of the Sea. The other seven people must have died. The three ships traveling with them are also likely to have met with misfortune. At about 7 a.m. yesterday morning, after the Hairui entered the port, Chief Mate Qian Yujia took Sun Xiaotian to the bureau to see Zhao Yuntai, the head of the Ship Section. After Zhao inquired about the cause, he gave him five yuan and sent someone to accompany him to the Navigation Administration Bureau to ask for a discretionary decision. After the Navigation Administration Bureau inquired about the cause of the accident, it notified the cargo owner to find a way to send the people back to Shandong. The Tongchangyuan sandboat lost a total of two or three thousand yuan, including cargo, sailors' money, and clothes. Sun Xiaotian and others are now reporting to the Senmao Company in Nanshi, which purchased and transported the goods, and reporting the cause of the accident to the Tongfeng Company in Yizhou, Shandong.</p>

<p>Japanese Consulate Orders Dai Zhenwu to Repay Debt</p>
<p>Fu Decides to Appear in Court at Next Hearing</p>
<p>The case of Fu Xiao'an, chairman of the Bank of China, suing lawyer Yan Dajue for intimidation in connection with the debt owed by Dai Zhenwu, a Ningbo native who has become a Japanese citizen, has attracted considerable attention in society. It is now known that the debt was borrowed from the Hongkou branch of the Bank of China in the twentieth year of the Republic. After the due date, Dai repeatedly delayed and refused to pay. Zhu Huanwen, the manager of the branch, filed a lawsuit with the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai as the legal representative to demand payment. Dai made many excuses during the court hearing, but the judge ruled that the evidence was conclusive and did not allow for excuses. Dai's empty claims were insufficient, and a judgment was issued on the 27th of last month, ordering Dai Zhenwu to repay the full amount. During the litigation, Dai entrusted a certain gentleman from Ningbo to mediate unsuccessfully. Later, he entrusted lawyer Yan to send a letter to Fu, alleging that the letter not only fabricated facts but also contained intimidation. Therefore, he hired lawyer Dai Chengxiang to file a private prosecution with the First Special District Court. The case has now been adjourned to the 17th of this month for continued hearing. It is reported that Mr. Fu Xiao'an will personally appear in court at that time.</p>

<p>Company Says It Escaped Danger Long Ago and Is Being Repaired in Dalian</p>
<p>Previous Rumors of Grounding May Be Misinformation</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that Zhengji Shipping Company's Hongli, with a gross tonnage of 771 tons and a net tonnage of 602 tons, specializes in sailing to Yingkou, Andong, Longkou, Yantai, and other places. Yesterday, according to news from the shipping industry, the ship ran aground on reefs when sailing to the Dengzhou sea the day before yesterday, due to a hurricane. Xinsheng News Agency reporters went to Zhengji Company last night and learned that the Hongli ran aground near Dengzhou a week ago after loading cargo from Yantai. It was rescued and escaped danger, but the bottom of the ship was damaged, so it sailed to Dalian for repairs in the shipyard. The company did not receive any telegrams from Dalian or Yantai about this grounding. It is feared that it is a misunderstanding of the previous grounding, as the ship is probably still being repaired in Dalian.</p>

<p>Half-Price Sale of New Books in Full Swing</p>
<p>Since the resumption of business, the Shanghai Commercial Press has reached its second anniversary in an instant. It has specially launched 1,200 kinds of new books for sale at half price for two months. The Henan Road Distribution Office, as well as the Jing'an Temple, Xiafei Road, and Hongkou branches, are holding the sale at the same time. Sacrificing hundreds of thousands of yuan, it benefits the seeds of reading. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Since the launch, the crowds of customers every day have been extremely crowded. The contents of the various books on display are not only in line with the needs of the times, but the forms are also completely free of defects such as dirt and water stains, which are completely different from ordinary cheap books. It is reported that this half-price book will be put on display one after another, and will be changed once a week. Starting from today, it is the second week, and many new books have been changed. Among them, the Chinese translation of Wells's great work, "The Outline of Science," sells for only four yuan at half price. The photo-reproduction of the ruins of the European-style palaces of the Old Summer Palace sells for only one yuan at half price. Professor Zhou Gengsheng's "Modern International Law Issues" sells for only one yuan and fifty cents at half price. The Chinese translation of Schiller's famous play, "Wallenstein," sells for only one yuan and one cent at half price. There are countless famous works. The ten types of dictionaries in the first week are still on display and are limited to over-the-counter or mail-order purchases. Each person is limited to one copy of each type.</p>

<p>The "Bathing Flower Studio Collection" was written by Yuan Hongdao (Shi Gong) of the late Ming Dynasty and was one of the books destroyed during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. Su Changgong's laughter, anger, and scolding all became articles. Shi Gong deeply understood the secret and was a strong general in the naturalistic literary movement of the late Ming Dynasty. He is also the most fashionable type of writing in the current literary world, the so-called Yuan Zhonglang school. Because it is a banned book, there are very few copies circulating. Many literati in China may not know who Yuan Zhonglang is, or what kind of writing Yuan Zhonglang's writing is. They must want to be the first to read it, so it is specially reprinted to supply readers. It is now distributed by the Times Book Company. The book is a reprint of the original manuscript from the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, so it is no different from the original. The binding is excellent, easy to carry, and the value is cheap.</p>

<p>Chen Fengxiang, the deceased director of Tudong in Pudong, was quite wealthy, which made him coveted by a general gang of bandits. At about 10 p.m. on July 10 of this year, Chen's son, Chen Baoming (16 years old), was kidnapped by bandits. That night, Baoming took advantage of the bandits' deep sleep and escaped from the den of thieves, returning home safely. Afterwards, Dong Zhaocheng, the director of the Third Section of the Third District in charge, found the bandits' nest in Hujiazhai, Situ, Haili Township, Nanhui County. He secretly ordered patrol officer Li Cunzheng to lead the police there quietly the day before yesterday. With the cooperation of the police chief of the Second Branch of Zhoupu, they arrested the woman Hu Yao, who was watching over the ransom, and a suspect living with her, inside No. 69 Hujiazhai, Situ. They were escorted to the station. After interrogation, it was learned that the suspect was not related and was immediately released on bail. Hu Yao was immediately sent to the Third Section of the Main Bureau. Hu Yao claimed to be 43 years old, from Nanhui County, living in Hujiazhai. Her former husband was dead, and she remarried to Hu Hegen as her husband. One night, my husband and I were already asleep when Li Apei came to knock on the door. I got up to open the door, and saw three people in total, one was Li Apei, one was not recognized, and there was a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old child. Li Apei claimed that he was tired from walking and came here to rest for a while, and told me to go to sleep and not to be next to him, so I went to sleep, and I didn't know anything else. As for Li Apei, he used to open an egg shop in Jinhui Bridge, Pudong, and my husband sold eggs for a living, so they knew each other. After being interrogated yesterday, he immediately prepared a document and ordered the police to transfer Hu Yao to the local court for legal action. After a long investigation by the prosecutor, he ordered her to be detained pending interrogation.</p>

It was probably transported by car to the roadside and abandoned there. District Chief Yao, considering the matter related to murder, ordered the local officials to report it to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy in order to arrest the murderer and investigate the case.</p>

<p>Yang Shulin, a native of Jiangxi, 37 years old, lived at No. 21 Dasheng Lane, Xiaodongshou. He borrowed more than 50 yuan from his relative Yang Dongsheng due to urgent needs. He has not yet been able to repay it due to economic difficulties. At about 1 p.m. the day before yesterday, Dongsheng went to Yang's house to demand repayment. The debt was not paid, and a major conflict arose between the two sides. At that time, Dongsheng was furious and slapped Yang twice. The neighbors mediated and resolved the matter. However, Yang was humiliated and depressed, and had the idea of committing suicide. At about 12 p.m. that night, he secretly untied his belt and hanged himself under the attic at home. It was not until about 5 a.m. yesterday morning that he was discovered by his housemate. But Yang had been dead for a long time, and it was impossible to revive him. They immediately reported the situation to the head of the Second Section of the First District, Liu.

<p>Tragedy of Painting the Roof of the Special Second Court</p>
<p>A three-story Western-style house at No. 16 Xuehuali Road, French Concession, is the property of the French Bureau of Public Works. It used to be the residence of the Western Prison Warden. After the prison of the Public Hall was taken back, the uppermost floor of the house was used by the Judicial Consultant's Office to set up an office and a lawyer's office in the police station. The second floor and the bottom floor were lent to the Special Second Local Court. The seventh and eighth courts were set up on the bottom floor. The second floor was set up by the Judicial Sergeant and the bailiffs. The roof was covered with lead skin and had to be painted once a year in summer. Recently, Wu Shengtai Paint Shop at No. 297 Fuxu Road was hired to send craftsmen to paint the roof. At 6:20 p.m. the day before yesterday, when the work was about to stop, Liu Afang, a 19-year-old apprentice painter from Shaoxing, slipped and fell from the roof, falling to the side of the road, causing internal organ and brain injuries. Xie Zhiming, a Chinese policeman No. 707 on guard in front of the Special Second District Prison, saw this and reported it to the Lujiawan Police Station. Liu was sent to Guangci Hospital in a car, but he died of serious injuries before he could be treated. His body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Mortuary for an autopsy. His father, Liu Sijiu, was sent to the case by a detective. The next morning, the Special Second Local Court appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren to the mortuary along with a forensic doctor and a clerk to verify that the deceased died from falling injuries during his lifetime. He ordered the body to be handed over to the father of the deceased, Liu Sijiu, for burial.</p>

<p>Sports News: Japanese Tennis Players' First Day of Performances</p>
<h3 id="e221">Lin Baohua Narrowly Loses to Ota <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Fighting fiercely but losing two sets 9-7, 6-4</p>
<p>In another singles match, Xiao Zheng wins against Watanabe 2-1</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai to play Ota today</p>
<p>The tennis team led by Ota, a former Japanese Davis Cup player, had their first performance in Shanghai yesterday. Because of Ota's reputation, a large number of Chinese and foreign men and women went to watch the competition. It was estimated that there were about 2,000 people. The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club of the French Chamber of Commerce was packed, an unprecedented scene. A total of two singles matches and one doubles match were performed. In the main battle, Lin Baohua lost to Ota 2-0 after a hard fight, 9-7, 6-4. Zheng Zhaojia won against Watanabe 2-1, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4. In the doubles match, Carlsson and Bonner Fee defeated Watanabe and Kotera 6-4, 5-2. The match was ended due to darkness. The second day of performances will continue from 3:30 PM today.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Zheng Zhaojia Defeats Watanabe <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Watanabe's momentum is strong Watanabe is the 15th-ranked singles player in Japan last year, and his tennis skills are similar to Zheng Zhaojia. However, his lack of endurance was unexpected. His shots were very powerful. After Watanabe served and won a game each at the beginning of the match, Watanabe relied on his fierce left and right diagonal shots to win four consecutive games, leading 5-1. Zhaojia repeatedly tried to block the net, but all failed. Sometimes the kill shot was too light, and sometimes it was hit out of bounds. By the seventh game, Zhaojia repeatedly attacked his backhand, winning a game. Watanabe won the first set 6-2.</p>
<p>Zhaojia comes from behind Zhaojia's loss in the first set was due to unstable shots. From the second set, Watanabe won two consecutive games. After several equalities in the second game, Watanabe won. In the third game, Watanabe served, and Xiao Zheng attacked his backhand again, finally winning the game. Unexpectedly, after this fierce battle, Watanabe's energy was exhausted. From then on, he was unable to recover, unable to run, and unable to hit hard. Xiao Zheng did whatever he wanted. Xiao Zheng won six consecutive games, taking back the second set 6-2. At the beginning of the third set, Xiao Zheng was careless and in great danger, trailing 1-4. But he intensified his efforts and won five consecutive games, winning the third set 6-4.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 Watanabe</p>
<h3 id="e223">Lin Baohua Loses to Ota <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>A glimpse of Ota's tennis skills Today, what we saw of Ota's tennis skills may have been less impressive than three or four years ago. His hitting technique is not particularly moving, but his steadiness is rare, which is the reason for his victory. The forehand draw is the most powerful and his masterpiece. From beginning to end, he made long baseline draws and only went to the net once. Baohua's net performance yesterday won the praise of the audience, often putting Ota in a desperate situation. His serve also scored a lot of points. It is a pity that his shots were unstable, and his shots were not as good as Ota's, resulting in repeated self-destruction at the net, and most of the points were lost there. Compared with Ota, the difference is not far.</p>
<p>Baohua takes the lead twice In the first set, Ota won 9-7 after a fierce battle. When Baohua was 2-4 and 3-5, he tried his best to catch up to 5-5. Then, he exceeded Ota twice at 6-5 and 7-6, but unfortunately, he was defeated by Ota's three consecutive victories. Baohua served and won first. Ota also won the serve. Baohua's serve game was lost because of two double serve errors, so Ota took the lead again at 3-1. In the sixth game, Baohua once went to the net to block, but although he succeeded, he still lost the game. Lin repeatedly wanted to go to the net, but could not. When Lin served when he was behind 3-5 in the ninth game, he won a game with a fierce serve. Then the situation suddenly changed, and he won three consecutive games, taking the lead at 6-5. But in the next game, Ota won with a smooth game. Baohua scored three consecutive points and took the lead again at 7-6, but in the end, he failed to grasp the opportunity and lost three consecutive games to Ota, losing 7-9.</p>
<p>Ota wins steadily Lin still served at the beginning of the second set and won the first game. Ota turned around and took the lead again at 3-1. In the fifth game, Lin served and won with a heavy ball. In the next game, Lin took the opportunity to go to the net and succeeded, so it became 3-3. But in the seventh game, Lin's serve game was won by Ota, so it became 4-3 and 5-3, and the situation had spread. Ota relied on his steady hitting technique to win the second set 6-4 again.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Japanese Doubles Skills Are Mediocre <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>The last doubles performance was by Carl邇 and Bonner Fee against Watanabe and Kotera. The skills were not very high, only the kill shots were fierce. Moreover, it was late, so it was hastily concluded. After 4-4 in the first set, Kaper won two consecutive games, winning 6-4. The Japanese were still depressed in the second set. When Kaper took the lead at 5-2, the game was ended due to the darkness.</p>
<p>Carlsson 6-4 Watanabe</p>
<p>Bonner Fee 5-2 Kotera</p>
<h3 id="e225">Today's Performance Schedule <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>

<p>Chen Rongming vs. Xia Lanzheng</p>
<p>Bao Dajing vs. Hu Zuoqiong</p>
<p>Since the Women's Open Tennis Tournament began on the 1st of this month, the situation has become increasingly tense.

The four ladies, Bao Dajing, Hu Zuoqiong, Chen Rongming, and Xia Lanzheng, have successively won the right to participate in the quarterfinals, which will be held this afternoon. Judging from the tennis skills, Bao's victory over Hu should not be a problem. Chen and Xia will definitely have a fierce battle. The winner will participate in the final on the 14th to compete for the championship. The doubles competition adopts a single round-robin system, and there is still one group that has not played.

These instructor students are outstanding teachers selected and recommended by the puppet Ministry of Education from various provinces, districts, and cities. After passing a strict examination, the puppet ministry will provide subsidies for them to study in Japan. They are required to return to Manchukuo to serve within one year. The following is a list of the number of people dispatched:</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 11th) The methods for distributing relief funds for Northeastern students studying abroad have been determined: Publicly funded students will receive an annual subsidy of 1,800 yuan, while privately funded students will be divided into four grades with subsidies of 400, 600, 700, and 800 yuan, limited to one payment. The intention of these funds is to provide temporary relief. If a student is unable to sustain themselves even after receiving the subsidy, the funds will be used as travel expenses for their return to China. Currently, students from England, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and other countries have applied, and a total of 28,000 yuan has been remitted.</p>

<h3 id="e240">General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts to be Established <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The preparatory office for the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts is located at the Lizi Society in Nanjing. Since its establishment, it has been urging various provinces and cities to establish provincial boy scout councils, form boy scout troops, and carry out various boy scout-related tasks, all of which are generally in order. After the General Regulations of the Boy Scout Association were revised and approved by the Central Conference in August of last year, preparations were made to establish the General Association and build a clubhouse on Wutaishan in Nanjing. Due to financial difficulties, the project was suspended indefinitely. The issue of establishing the General Association was not urgently submitted for discussion at the preparatory meeting of the association. The original personnel in charge of preparations in Nanjing were Dai Chuanxian, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Zhizhong, and others. There were also more than ten preparatory committee members. Regarding the affiliation of the association, its nature suggests it should belong to military training, but in practice, it involves students from various schools, so whether it belongs to the Directorate General of Military Training or the Ministry of Education has not been decided. Moreover, the personnel in charge of the association's preparations are highly respected, making the affiliation issue even more complicated. Recently, it seems that it has been assigned to the Ministry of Education. Last month, a proposal by the Ministry of Education to establish the Chinese Boy Scout Council was approved by the Central Committee. After the council appoints personnel, it will take over from the preparatory office of the Boy Scout General Association. The preparatory office of the Boy Scout General Association is now handling the closing procedures and preparing for the handover. The preparatory work is about to come to an end. The General Association is expected to be established this month or at the latest in September. It is also heard that the members of the Chinese Boy Scout Council were nominated by the Ministry of Education and approved by the Central Committee. Future council members will be elected by the boy scouts themselves.</p>

<p>Children! I believe you must have thrown coins or other things on the ground or on a table. After throwing them, what do you feel about the objects? Wouldn't they bounce up? And the harder you throw them, the higher they bounce, right? But have you ever wondered:</p>
<p>"Why is this happening?"</p>
<p>The British Newton doubted this phenomenon, and because of this doubt, he invented the law of "reaction," which means that when a coin is thrown onto a table or the ground, the table or the ground exerts an equal force in the opposite direction. Because the force exerted is equal, the harder you throw the coin, the higher it bounces. And because the direction is opposite, the coin is thrown downwards, and it bounces upwards.</p>
<p>Children! We should doubt everything, and you should ask: "Why is this happening?" I know that if you do this, your knowledge will improve rapidly, and becoming Newton and inventing laws is not a difficult thing.</p>

After several repairs, the owner still can't get the accurate time. Then, the owner will be discouraged and give us a long-term rest." The wristwatch said, "This method is not very appropriate. Showing accurate time is our duty. People who abandon their duties and neglect their duties will never have good results, I think."</p>
<p>The wall clock saw that the wristwatch did not agree with its proposed method, and secretly laughed at its stupidity and timidity, so it went alone to do this. Sure enough, the owner sent it to the clock shop for repair. After three or four repairs in a row, it was still full of errors, and it was like not being repaired at all. The owner then threw it in the corner of the drawer. At this time, the wall clock, seeing that it had achieved its goal of a long-term rest, felt unspeakably happy in its heart.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, things turned out contrary to the wall clock's expectation. It quietly lived in the corner of the drawer. Although it seemed very comfortable, it was covered in dust and lost its original beauty. The things that kept it company were all junk. It felt somewhat disappointed. But even more unfortunate things followed. The owner sent it to the clock shop to exchange for a new watch strap for the wristwatch. The clock shop owner saw that all its parts were rusted, so he unloaded it and used its parts to make up for the damage to other watches. As a result, the wall clock was torn apart, leaving only an empty shell. It deeply regretted it, but it was already too late.</p>

<p>— Yīzhèn</p>
<p>Old Uncle Nian has four children: First Sister Chun, Second Brother Xia, Third Sister Qiu, and Fourth Brother Dong. Chun and Qiu are the two most gentle and beautiful children, and everyone likes them and loves them. But the personalities of Second Brother Xia and Fourth Brother Dong are different from their sisters, and they are the two most inferior and naughty children. They are completely the typical bad children.</p>
<p>Fourth Brother Dong's face is always gloomy and terrifying. The children of the Hundred Herbs family will run away when they see him. The timid ones are scared to death by him. It is said that his two "guys" are very powerful; he can do Shaolin Kung Fu very well.</p>
<p>Second Brother Xia is a tyrannical child. He has no etiquette in dealing with people, and everyone hates and scolds him when they see him. He has thousands of retainers, like flies, mosquitoes, gnats, centipedes, snakes... All of them are cruel villains and insidious people.</p>
<p>Among these four children, Second Brother Xia is the most fierce and cruel: like this year, he forcibly occupied the home of "Yellow Mold," seized the power of "Rain" Old Gentleman, and dried up the water in the fields; causing the farmers great suffering!</p>
<p>Children! Do you want to keep this fierce and cruel Second Brother Xia?</p>

<p>— Bózhēn</p>
<p>The clock rang twelve times, as if saying, "It's time for people to eat lunch." Min'er felt very happy after hearing the clock strike twelve times, because his stomach had been rumbling with hunger for an hour or two. He ran like a flying arrow to the kitchen to tell his mother: "Mom! Is the rice cooked yet? It's already twelve o'clock." His mother said, "It's cooked. Go arrange the chairs and wipe the table clean. I'll put out the side dishes."</p>
<p>Min'er went outside to arrange the chairs and wipe the table, busy without stopping.</p>
<p>At the round table sat Min'er and his father, mother, and his older brother, Cong'er.</p>
<p>His mother had just given Min'er a bowl of rice. He took it and quickly put it into his mouth, not even chewing it carefully.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he started to hiccup. His mother patted him on the top of his head. He felt that his hiccups got a little better with each pat from his mother. Sure enough, after more than ten pats, the hiccups stopped. He said, "Mother is an effective doctor." His older brother laughed at what he said.</p>
<p>But Min'er didn't know why eating quickly caused hiccups, so he asked his older brother.</p>
<p>His older brother said, "There are two tubes in a person's throat. The one in the front is called the trachea, and the fresh air we breathe passes through this tube to the lungs. The one in the back is called the esophagus, and the food we eat passes through this tube to the stomach.</p>
<p>So why does eating quickly cause hiccups?</p>
<p>The rice we eat should normally go to the esophagus, but if we eat too fast, the rice doesn't have time to go to the esophagus and mistakenly enters the trachea.</p>
<p>At that time, you shouldn't swallow any more rice. Wait until the rice comes back out of the trachea and goes back to the esophagus, then your hiccups will stop."</p>
<p>So from then on, Min'er always chewed carefully every time he ate.</p>

<h3 id="e261">Thunder and Lightning <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>Little friends! When there are showers in the summer, you must hear the rumbling sounds in the sky and see the shimmering light. Your parents may have told you, "That's the Thunder God and Lightning Goddess performing magic, punishing all evildoers." You must not believe this. You should know that the sound is the result of air vibration, and the light is caused by the contact of electricity.</p>
<p>Clouds often contain electricity, some positive and some negative. Electricity has the property of like charges repelling and opposite charges attracting. Rubbing a glass rod with silk or an ebonite rod with flannel can generate electricity and attract light objects such as paper scraps and dust (Figure 1). After rubbing an ebonite rod to generate negative electricity and suspending it in the air with silk thread, and then rubbing a glass rod to generate positive electricity and bringing it close to the ebonite rod, they will attract each other (Figure 2). However, if there were two ebonite rods or two glass rods, this would not be possible. When clouds in the sky containing opposite charges approach each other in mid-air, they will attract each other, but air does not easily conduct electricity, so there must be extremely high electrical pressure for the current to pass through the air. When it first passes through the air, countless electric sparks occur (Figure 3), and at the same time, the air is broken down by the electricity and rapidly vibrates into a loud noise. This light is called lightning, and the sound is thunder. Like the whirligig we play with (Figure 4), the faster it is pulled, the more violently the bamboo board vibrates the air, and the sound gradually becomes louder. The formation of thunder is the same. However, light travels fast, at a speed of about 300 million meters per second, while sound travels slowly, at only 331 meters per second. Therefore, although sound and light occur simultaneously in mid-air, we see the lightning first and then hear the thunder when they reach us.</p>
<p>Since Benjamin Franklin (Figure 5) discovered electricity in clouds more than 180 years ago, the principle of thunder and lightning has been proven very thoroughly. Currently, many European and American power laboratories even have people experimenting with artificial lightning! The so-called thunder striking people is actually an accidental association of electrocution. This radiating electricity, whether it is a person or an animal, is fatal upon contact, and houses and large trees are often burned down by electrocution. Therefore, tall buildings now have lightning rods to attract opposite charges to the ground (Figure 6). During thunderstorms, do not walk outside, do not wear wet clothes, and do not lean against high walls or large trees to avoid electrocution.</p>
<h3 id="e262">The Benefits and Harms of Eating Watermelon <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>In modern nutrition science, how much value does watermelon, the king of summer fruits, have? According to the research results of the famous medical scientist Dr. Xue Tai, the flesh contains 95.96% water, 2.87% carbohydrates, 0.78% protein, 0.20% ash, 0.10% fat, and 0.09% fiber. However, when we eat watermelon, for example, red-fleshed watermelon, after eating all the red part, the white part is discarded because it tastes bland. However, the composition of the white discarded part is not much different from the red part, except that the ash content is slightly less, and the protein and fat are more than the white part. Also, the sugar content of watermelon is 6 to 8%, two-thirds of which is fructose. Compared to the central part without seeds, the surrounding part with more seeds, and the inner skin part without the outer skin, the central part contains the most fructose, glucose, and sucrose, the surrounding part is second, and the part near the outer skin is the least, so the thickness of the sweetness varies layer by layer. As for the vitamins contained in watermelon, they are the most abundant among summer fruits, so people with chronic kidney disease benefit from eating more watermelon, which has a special diuretic effect. This year's climate is unusually hot, and the sales of soda, cold drinks, refreshing beverages, and fruits are very large, indicating that many people in society are eating them. However, indulging in temporary gratification and eating too much watermelon will cause abdominal distension, and various diseases will follow, because watermelon is a plant that is not easily digested, and it contains too much water, which is harmful to the stomach, intestines, and kidneys. (Editor's note): Children, when eating watermelon, do not swallow the seeds. Chew the pulp and spit it out immediately, so there will be no harm from indigestion.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Standing an Egg Upright <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qianchuo</p>
<p>Little friends! Can you stand a raw egg (duck egg is also acceptable) upright on the table without damaging it? Or do you even think it is impossible? In fact, it is not difficult. Just hold the egg in your hand and shake it gently a few times, then slowly stand it upright on a smooth table, and it will stand up.</p>
<p>There are a few points to pay attention to when doing this game: (1) The movement must be steady and not hasty; (2) It must be stood on a smooth table; (3) If it cannot stand upright immediately, shake the egg a few more times.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to tell you the reason why the egg stands upright: Before the egg is shaken, its entire weight is concentrated in the center of the egg, so it can lie horizontally on the table. After the egg is shaken, its entire weight gradually gathers at one end of the egg. We stand this end upright on the table, and of course it can stand up.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Blue Fish and White Fish <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>In the water, the blue fish always has many white fish following it closely, why are they so close? Because the white fish are greedy and want to take advantage of free food, the blue fish often cannot eat the food it finds.</p>
<p>However, children may have questions about this. The blue fish forages for food, and the white fish also forages for food. Why do the white fish want to steal the food the blue fish finds? The blue fish has already found food in its mouth, why doesn't it eat it itself, but instead it is stolen by the white fish? Isn't this very special?</p>
<p>Originally, the blue fish has sharp teeth in its throat and chews food very well. It likes to eat snails the most, chewing the snails in its throat and then spitting them out, causing the fine hard shells to sink, and then eating the clean meat. Who knew that the white fish would take this opportunity to take advantage of it. When the snail meat was rippling in the water, they would swarm up and搶吃it. The food that the blue fish was about to eat was enjoyed by the white fish who ate for free. The white fish simply had no teeth and could neither eat the whole snail nor taste the delicious snail meat, and always wanted to take the opportunity to steal it, so they always followed the blue fish closely.</p>
<p>One day, an old fisherman was fishing under the shade of a willow tree on the堤岸, his eyes fixed on the mark on the fishing line. As long as the mark moved, he would know that a fish was hooked, and he would immediately lift it up. The blue fish and white fish happened to swim to the fishing hook. The fishing hook was baited with earthworm meat. The white fish followed the old pattern of抢螺蛳meat, hurriedly抢着 it. As soon as it reached its mouth, the line was lifted up, and with a flip, it was already in the old fisherman's fish basket. The old fisherman put down the fishing hook again and caught white fish again. This happened several times. The blue fish could not grab the bait and was never hooked, so it swayed and swam to another place. The white fish were still struggling in the fish basket. The old fisherman smiled and said to the white fish, "You have always loved to take advantage of small gains. You must know that greed for small gains will eventually suffer great losses. Do you realize it now? But regret is useless."</p>
<p>Children, people's behavior should be upright and honest, and value integrity and self-respect. Do not贪图 those improper advantages that are not rightfully yours.贪图 Small gains often lead to great disasters.</p>

<p>— Yong Cai</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you think the weather is hot this year? I will teach you how to make a small toy to cool off the summer heat! However, before you start making this small toy, you must first prepare some simple materials: a piece of wood 8 inches long and 5 inches wide, two empty cigarette cans, four bamboo sticks 6 inches long and 3/4 inches thick and wide, 15 inches of thick lead wire, and a section of iron pipe 1.5 inches long (this section of iron pipe is an important material in this small toy, and its thickness should be slightly thicker than the prepared thick lead wire. If you don't know how to make it, you can go to an iron shop to make one, three or four copper coins will be enough.) A strip of flat, wide tape, 丨丨After the above materials are prepared, we can start making it.</p>
<p>When starting to make this toy, we can divide it into two steps: the first step is to make the wings, and the second step is to make the axle.</p>
<p>First step: First cut open the empty cigarette cans, according to the pattern and size in (Figure 1) 丨丨密达尺丨, cut out two identical wings, then cut a piece of iron skin the size of a copper coin from the remaining iron. After cutting, first cross the two wings at the center, make a hole in the center point of the wings with a nail, and then install it on one end of the iron pipe, making sure it is tightly attached and does not move (it is best to ask the ironmonger to solder it firmly). On the other end of the iron pipe, make a hole in the same way with the round iron piece, and install it tightly as shown in Figure 1. After installing, cut a section of thick lead wire 2.5 inches long and insert it into the inside of the iron pipe (note: the iron pipe should be free to move on the lead wire). Then take the prepared bamboo material, drill a hole in the upper end of two of the sticks, and tightly attach both ends of the lead wire to the holes, as shown in Figure 3. In this way, the first step is completed.</p>
<p>Second step: Take the lids of the two cigarette cans and close them tightly together. Then make a hole in the center of the lids, insert the remaining lead wire tightly, and also make sure it does not move (it is best to also ask the ironmonger to solder it firmly), as shown in Figure 4. After inserting, drill two holes in the upper end of the remaining two bamboo sticks in the same way. These two holes should be drilled a little larger so that the lead wire has room to move in the middle. After drilling, insert the lead wire separately, and after inserting, bend the lead wire into a handle, as shown in Figure 5. In this way, the second step is also completed.</p>
<p>After both steps are done, take the four bamboo sticks and钉在them on the wooden board according to the appropriate position and distance. Then take the flat, wide tape and tie it to the iron pipe and axle, as shown in Figure 6. In this way, the entire project is completed.</p>
<p>How to play: Whenever you are reviewing your homework or have nothing to do, put it next to you and gently搖動the axle. The four wings will quickly轉動, and at the same time, the cool and large wind will襲面的來驅逐the summer heat around you. Little friends! You see how interesting and practical this toy is.</p>

<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>These days, women seem particularly disappointing. In this time of national crisis and impending home collapse, instead of coming out to do things beneficial to society, they like to be foreign slaves, salespeople for foreign goods, and take this opportunity to dress in a妖妖艶艶manner to seduce the opposite sex. No wonder those patriotic people (?) look at this situation and think that the country's demise is entirely caused by these妖孽, so Guangdong took the lead in banning men and women from going together and bathing together..., seemingly with the intention of sweeping away妖孽. And the newspapers do not hesitate to use paper to write in large characters about how much cosmetics are imported, how much this year has increased compared to last year, and how much this month has increased compared to last month. We also admit that our women's world is really disappointing, but tracing the source of the disaster, we cannot completely blame women.</p>
<p>We know that Chinese women have been bound by the iron chains of the three obediences and four virtues since ancient times, and cannot speak of freedom or will. Although it seems that they have recently obtained equality in politics, education, and economics, those are only occasionally obtained by lucky people. Most, no, it should be said that all, are still slaves, acting as commodities; because they are slaves, they have to listen to the master's orders to please him, because they are commodities, they have to decorate and embellish to seek sales. This is the origin of strange clothing and exotic clothing, and it is also the reason why cosmetics can be sold so well. Therefore, a more fundamental solution is to give every woman an equal and independent position, without having to exchange her body for living materials. Under this principle, first, society should no longer have slave-based education, and second, society should provide women with a truly independent environment.</p>
<p>Otherwise, those who speak earnestly, those who act remain the same, which does not help the facts, and if this continues, there will inevitably be a danger of intensifying.</p>
<h3 id="e267">The Problem of Higher Education <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Now is the time when countless school recruitment advertisements occupy the prominent positions of various newspapers; it is also the time when young men and women students徘徊奔波, looking for a way to higher education. On the other hand, the establishment of the "Beiping University Graduates' Vocational Movement Alliance" has resonated throughout the country, which fully proves that students have no way out. In this current society where "more students graduate from schools, the more unemployed members society increases," female students are particularly unemployed. Because in this male-centered society, the scope of women's occupations is very narrow, not to mention in this large reserve army of unemployment, women lack experience in争夺饭碗, and are also treated differently by society, so finding a job is naturally more difficult than climbing to the sky. Therefore, now that the lucky female students are able to仰承祖泽, and can go to higher education, in order to find a preparation for future outlets, they have to pay more attention to this serious problem.</p>
<p>I think there are at least two points that female youths who are going to higher education should carefully consider: one is the school; the other is the subject.</p>
<p>The choice of school is the first and main task for those who are going to higher education. However, the method of selection cannot solely rely on the advertisements and regulations published in the newspaper, because now, some schools have already been commercialized, and their regulations and advertisements inevitably have the deceptive nature of buying and selling. The advertisement says that someone is the principal and someone is the chairman of the board, nothing more than holding名人 to do招摇撞骗of a cover. Therefore, we had better inquire from reliable friends and classmates to get the真相. The criteria for choosing a school should pay attention to: (1) whether the school is public or private. If it is private, then how is its fund? How about the equipment? And how about the teachers? Should be considered, according to what we know, the tuition fees of public and private schools are often inversely proportional, and the tuition fees of public schools with sufficient funds must be low, and the equipment must be excellent, because it is not supported by the tuition fees of students. On the contrary,不三不四的"wild chicken" schools (large, middle, and small schools are the same), most of them do not have reliable funds, and all teachers' salaries, rent, equipment, and all other expenses are "wool from the sheep - from the students that裏" squeeze out, therefore the tuition fees of private schools are very high, and they have to be high. At the same time, most of these schools are for the purpose of business, and will not hire excellent teachers with high salaries. (2) What should be noted is the reputation of the school in the society, and the general level of knowledge of the school graduates, which is also very important, because schools with good reputation are respected by the society, and students with good grades are needed by the society. (3) What should be noted is which subject of the school has the best equipment, and whether it is close to the旨趣 of the person, because a suitable environment can arouse one's interest in learning, so that the effect of "doing more with less" can be achieved. (4) Girls should choose schools with male and female classmates, because in this way, they can cultivate social, open, equal and respectful habits, and also increase the psychology of competition in learning between men and women, unlike some women's "special schools," which spend all their precious time learning cooking, sewing, embroidery, and other courses, and neglect the cultivation of basic knowledge of natural science or social science.</p>
<p>As for the choice of subjects, I think we should choose the important ones from the subjects we like and learn them, and also take into account the needs of the society, which leads to social problems.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that social problems have the closest relationship with us. Some people who study natural science often ignore this social problem. But everyone knows that these natural sciences 丨 physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, are related to social sciences, and at the same time, her application needs a social environment, as for social sciences 丨 such as economics is the basis of society, and literature, education, law, philosophy, politics... are the upper construction of social organization. If we want to make what we have learned in line with reality; to correctly understand society; to solve the difficulties of society, and to achieve our expectations for society, we must make a determination to do in-depth research when going to higher education.</p>
<p>Finally, let us talk about the "good wife and loving mother" education that some people have recently advocated that women should return to the family. I don't know if these people are afraid that the increase in female生力军 in occupational competition, so they want to drive women home裏, to live the life of a cook and a female worker, so that everything in society is独裁by men. If this is the case, not only will it not solve the basic contradictions of the current society, but it will deepen it more and more. This is undoubtedly a counter-era倒车 method, which is no different from the foolish actions of workers打毁machines in the early eighteenth century. In fact, if women only seek some "good wife and loving mother" education, and go home裏 to "serve her husband and follow her son," according to the general situation of the current society, it will only increase the burden on men, and cut off the road to women's economic independence, which is only suitable for a few "闻人"’s grandmothers and wives. Regarding these, we have explained it very clearly in the previous text that marrying is not a woman's career. Moreover, the number of women who can go to higher education and find a job is very small. It is impossible to make up for the current large-scale unemployed Chinese society with this "鳳毛麟角"’s微而又微 number. At the same time, we are determined not to live a parasitic, inhuman life of shackles. Our "贤良" should be placed in all undertakings that are beneficial to society. This is also a problem that students who are preparing to go to higher education should pay attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Words from a Female Teacher <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Wu</p>
<p>After reading "Divorce and Educational Bankruptcy"</p>
<p>In today's era when everything is not on the right track, the life of a female teacher is of course often unreasonable. First, in terms of sex, until now, except for a very small number of enlightened people, it is still believed that female teachers should maintain the life of a holy woman, just like傳道師姑. Marriage (referring to marriage that is not arranged by parents and媒奺’s words) has been regarded as亵渎, and divorce is even more悖谬; as recorded in the previous issue of this journal "Divorce and Educational Bankruptcy," the city of H actually had such an absurd statement about Ms. C. Educational bankruptcy and divorce do have some indirect relationship; but one person's divorce due to disagreement is educational bankruptcy. This is as illogical as "the river water falls a thousand feet" and "a cliff is ten thousand feet deep."</p>
<p>How can education go bankrupt? Many people attribute it to the educators' "moral depravity and loss of integrity"; but educators are not all selected unscrupulous people, this explanation is always too唯心. As for female teachers' marriage and divorce, and even being regarded as an element of educational bankruptcy, this is even more of a superficial understanding of Freud's theory.</p>
<p>Ideally, even if educators cannot be great personalities or creators of great culture, they should also be the搬运者 of these two. But in reality, everyone is like a day laborer,搬运ing to the next generation of people, are fragmented bricks and tiles,停了機械, and even污穢糞土! Life and the system force him to do so; if Pestalozzi were resurrected, he would not be able to save the entire destruction here.</p>
<p>However, it is irresponsible to attribute everything to the environment. Soundness itself can be half of the effort. The ignorance, shallow views, narrowness, and hypocrisy of general educators... do not necessarily depend on the environment for improvement: and these automatic improvements may have more needs in the area of female teachers. Generally speaking, because women have been雌伏 for thousands of years, once they reach the equal position of teachers with men, they will be complacent and unwilling to seek more. For learning and knowledge, the day of graduation from母校 is the absolute graduation; for social and life problems, they inherit the spirit of雌伏 and think that it is not essential. What supports and excites them daily is the self-comfort and self-aggrandizement of "outstanding from the crowd"; in many places, there must be a装作 of loneliness. The reasons for the popular singleism some time ago are complicated, but this装作 is the main angle. Its influence, combined with the feudal concept of貞操, has further consolidated the social requirement for female teachers to be圣女. As a result, our students cannot see a trace of the尾巴骨 of personality influence from female teachers, but only see the皮毛 of hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Some装作 for a lifetime, but some inevitably变节 later. But her shallow and narrow knowledge cannot make her understand that this is the nature of humanity, and to come out with光明坦白; for ordinary people, especially for students, she can only come out with an increased degree of hypocrisy. A唯美 old friend of mine often said angrily: "It's better to be a prostitute than to be a female teacher!" How cruel prostitutes are, she doesn't seem to know: the boredom of female teachers' lives, she knows thoroughly.</p>
<p>The divorce incident of Ms. C in city H can only be used as a material for field research when teaching the problem of love and marriage: if it is believed that sexual life should be avoided from students, and the situation of educational bankruptcy caused by the environment and each other is not given in-depth research and reflection, but lightly推 in a certain person's certain matter, this is a丢人 statement in the male and female education circles.</p>
<p>However, depending on the situation, my colleagues in the female education community, whether they can break the false, self-enclosed life: whether they can do more to exert a little effort on the influence of personality and the搬运 of culture, but it should have a stronger self-criticism.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Re-reading "Nora" <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— First</p>
<p>Hot, hot, truly an extraordinary heat! Heat that breaks sixty years of records, a heat that we who have only lived thirty years have never experienced. Don't you feel your head spinning? Don't you feel your body weary? If you haven't tasted this, you can't know how difficult heat is to bear. If you have tasted how difficult this heat is to bear, you will be afraid when you think of it.</p>
<p>I deeply believe that the truth in this world can only be truly understood through experience. Theories, no matter how novel and profound they are, if they do not come from personal experience, are inevitably just fantasies, unreliable. I certainly won't believe them. Conversely, if it is the truth, it will make you believe. Otherwise, it just means you are too naive to be able to experience it.</p>
<p>During the scorching summer vacation, the hot wind makes people listless, and nothing can lift their spirits. But you can't just sit idle and let this long summer pass. So, reading novels became the only way to relieve the summer heat. These past two days, I have been reading Pan Jiaxun's translation of the Ibsen collection. I had read this book when it was first published more than ten years ago. At that time, I was a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girl, newly liberated in thought from a closed-off environment. Seeing a member of the opposite sex, I would always lower my head in shyness; how could I have the courage to think about the relationship between the sexes at all? Moreover, at that time, public social interactions between the sexes were just beginning, and everything had to be done cautiously to avoid giving people something to gossip about. After all, I was a product of the restraints of traditional ethics, and I naturally tended towards the sublime of "spiritualism." I treated both sexes as "people," and letters written to female friends were love letters, and letters written to male friends were also love letters. I never thought that different things could happen between men and women.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, I read Ibsen's "Nora," "Ghosts," and "The Lady from the Sea," and I treated them as plays, as stories. Although I understood a little bit of the abstract concept—knew that women should not be men's playthings, relying on men to live; but later I became a man's plaything and relied on a man to live without even realizing it. As for things like sexual life, sexual hygiene, and sexual diseases, even when I gave birth to my third child, I still hadn't fully understood them. It wasn't until an accidental stroke of luck—yes, I can say that was my luck—that liberated me from the hands of my "husband," and only now do I truly sympathize with Nora, Alida, and Mrs. Alving; only now do I truly understand, "First and foremost, I am a human being. Just like you. —No matter what, I must strive to be a human being." "Complete freedom! Still, take responsibility! Don't take responsibility! With this, everything will be different."</p>
<p>How has the environment abused me! How has life tormented me! I painfully struggled forward in the deep ditch of hardship. However, I am completely free, I take responsibility myself—take on the responsibility of being a human being. I feel that I am a person, striving to be a person, and there is an indescribable joy in my heart! Thinking back to the past, living in a dream of love, being a wife in her husband's hands, even my clothing and food were managed by him. He said I was stupid and ugly, not letting me take full responsibility for the family, not giving me control over the family finances; buying some decorations without my consent, telling me to dress up beautifully and look good according to his wishes. And his sexual organs became diseased because of his excessive masturbation, but he didn't tell me clearly—I deeply believe he understood. His sexual life was selfish and self-serving. He didn't pay attention to hygiene, and didn't sincerely practice restraint. He was an extravagant, unrestrained person.</p>
<p>Believing in "Love is supreme" and "Love is unconditional"—these words that men use to deceive women—subject to the criticism of justice, the condemnation of conscience, is so shameful! Alas! Even now, when I think back to it, I'm still afraid! Still trembling! Just like the record-breaking heat of sixty years that killed so many people, and I almost, didn't die from the heat, it's just as terrifying.</p>
<p>Dear friend, have you, like me, tasted the life of a Nora, an Alida, or a Mrs. Alving, or other various and different slaves, inhuman lives? Do you also want to taste the flavor of "striving to be a free person, taking on the responsibilities of a person," a refreshing way to relieve the summer heat? This is a bitter medicine, which will give you temporary pain. But it will remove your disease, and when you wake up, you will feel comfortable and happy! That taste, like eating bitter melon, eating olives, in the bitterness, in the astringency, there is a subtle and indescribable deliciousness.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Letter <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>This is a personal letter from my old friend Bai Wei, mostly criticisms and suggestions for this publication, so I am publishing it for readers to see.</p>
<p>Editor</p>
<p>Zi Jiu:</p>
<p>Because I wanted to have a deep talk with you, I tried to see you dozens of times. I paid a visit to your residence a month ago, but you weren't home. I wanted to visit again, but it was delayed.</p>
<p>You are a capable fellow, working tirelessly on many things. Compared to you, I, this useless thing, feel ashamed to death! So you, being clever, knew this early on and cut off our friendship long ago.</p>
<p>When Ding Ling flew to the sky, I was rolling around in hell, gasping for breath; when you were rising step by step, working hard, even though I had crawled out of the gates of hell, I couldn't crawl anymore. Currently, I am suffering from pain that cuts like a knife and burns like fire. You and I are truly "heaven and earth," like not being able to touch the blue sky, I can't reach you. Recalling the years when we were classmates and lived together, I bought you fresh flowers, set up painting scenes for you, accompanied you in painting from morning till night, spent the whole day with you wandering the snowy scenery of Inokashira Park, and finally, I persuaded you to watch operas… Those, are all like "flowing water, falling flowers, spring has gone." Only the youthful, passionate friendship of that time, and your momentary beauty, often stir up waves in my memories, making my internal organs feel sore and distressed.</p>
<p>During the ten years of separation, although I went to see you several times, met you several times, you were openly cold towards me, as if you and I had never had a friendship.</p>
<p>Zi Jiu, is that my hypersensitivity? Or does the environment determine that you and I can only be like that? (Omission)</p>
<p>This spring, in the cultural education hall's living room, you brought up the news of the slander against me in the Morning Post and laughed at me, as if it were very serious, as if I were immersed in happiness.</p>
<p>It's no wonder you, who knows my personality? Who can prove my real life? If someone knew my personality, understood my steadfast, painful real life, no matter who, even if they wouldn't shed tears for me, they would feel a sad and mournful emotion. (Omission)</p>
<p>Let me tell you: for more than ten years, ever since you all knew about my sensational romance until today, I haven't enjoyed even half a month of life's pleasures, only a miserable life more profound than any tragedy, biting me relentlessly.</p>
<p>Enough with the nonsense, let's get down to business.</p>
<p>Why do I want to say all this nonsense to you? I want to lift the heavy curtain separating us, open my heart, and talk to you about serious matters.</p>
<p>A few days ago, you said to me, "The reason I accepted editing the Women's Garden is to give us a place to speak." In this era where passionate blood can only subside, where women must return to the family, you took on this editorship to give us a place to speak, you are right!</p>
<p>But, what has been said in your garden in the past? What do you want to say in the future? What is your overall plan? Just gossiping about women's common knowledge? Having scholarly gentlemen come up with profound studies? Standing in a detached position, blandly discussing women's issues? Friend, don't leave this sharp society, don't leave these sharp women, you are just like a storyteller in the streets, telling old stories!</p>
<p>True, people like Bi Yun, Bi Wu, and Bi Yao have also repeatedly made many famous speeches scolding the bad customs of the past.</p>
<p>However, new evil winds, corruption, decadence, such as their worship of money, their bloodsucking, their cunning, their ruthlessness; their demon-like appearance, their fox-like intentions; their failure to improve themselves, their living from day to day, their gladly being soulless meat puppets; their vanity, their laziness, seeking only material satisfaction, willingly submitting to wicked men for life; their lack of self-respect, their willful abandon, their dizzying, confused relationships with countless members of the opposite sex, living a degenerate, promiscuous life… Have any of you come out to criticize and discuss these sharp phenomena of the present?</p>
<p>On the bustling streets, the streets are full of clothes racks made of foreign materials, lips painted as red as a vampire, flaunting their bloodsucking hearts; in theaters or playgrounds, they are filled with soulless pieces of flesh, their vile giggling making people nauseous, their frantic swaying making people cringe, walking like wandering corpses, extravagant to the extreme; in large family mansions, there are mostly modern women who are preoccupied with dressing up and beautifying themselves, who are idle and wasteful, they neither know their responsibilities to the nation and society, nor do they take care of their families and children, only mahjong and movies can while away their time, Peking opera, dancing, and affairs are also indispensable stimuli for them. Have you ever loudly called out to these bloodsucking, parasitic women, telling them to quickly get up and be human beings, or else, like killing mosquitoes and flies, will you implement measures to drive them away?</p>
<p>Most of the women in Chinese cities are bustling, lazy, and shameless, not living as human beings there. How many make people want to frown and feel nauseous, ah, women are demons! (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Wen Juan</p>
<p>Today marks exactly one year since I came to this factory. It is said that from today onwards, night shifts will begin. My uncle came to call me, telling me to go eat dinner immediately. I must be at the factory by 5:30 to work the night shift. So, I dropped what I was washing and went to eat.</p>
<p>Tonight is a bit too much to handle. Not having worked the night shift for several months, now that it's starting again, my head feels a bit dizzy. What I hate most is the four-month-old baby in my belly, causing trouble there, sliding up and down, moving non-stop. There's no stool to sit on, standing next to the machine for a full twelve hours like this, how can I endure it!</p>
<p>Sister Zhang saw that I was uncomfortable and told me to take a day off first. But I still勉强 to support myself, gritting my teeth and working on.</p>
<p>Alas, it's really too much to handle! The machine is malfunctioning, malfunctioning, again and again. By the time I had just connected the broken warp ends, the shuttle in front had punched a hole in the Indian silk, tearing out more than an inch, and then reconnected twenty or thirty ends. With such constant ups and downs, the baby moved too uncomfortably, my waist ached, and my legs felt like two sticks, already without sensation. I really, really wanted a bed to lie down comfortably for a while, just for a moment would be enough.</p>
<p>It's two o'clock now, I turned off the machine, wanting to doze off next to it. Just as my eyes were closing, suddenly, "Wham…" I woke up with a start, only to find that the machine on the opposite side, machine number two, probably dozing off herself, let out such a loud scream to excite her spirit, but I really couldn't support it anymore, my head felt like it was splitting open. The slow, clumsy "tat-tat-tat" of the motor sound echoed mechanically in my brain forever. My heart was working as frantically as a shuttle in my chest at extreme speed, it almost wanted to jump out of my mouth. Then, I vomited, vomited all over the floor. My uncle asked for a day off for me, telling me to go home to recuperate immediately.扶 to the factory gate, he went inside. He seemed to be grumbling: "Miss is used to being pampered!" Alas, men really don't understand women's suffering, even my own uncle is like this. If I had the strength at that moment, I would definitely have turned around and scolded him. On the way home, I vomited three more times in a row, it was so hard.</p>
<p>Back home, I was already like a dying person, but all kinds of thoughts surged up in my mind together: If I continue to be sick like this forever, can I continue my work tomorrow? If I don't go to the factory, how will my livelihood be solved? I can't even maintain the most basic living standard now, how can I bear this double burden when the child is born in the future? My heart is broken! My head is spinning! Tears are falling like a spring! Oh God! Tragic fate!</p>

<p>Overseas Financial News Arrives Frequently</p>
<p>Buying Activity is Particularly Strong When Prices are Low</p>
<p>The Gold Market is Currently Turning Upward, So People's Hearts Can Be Held. Therefore, Yesterday, Although Overseas Market Conditions Were Not Profitable, They Were Maintained with Great Effort Due to Frequent Buying on the Dips. As a Result, They Continued to Recover Well. However, the Situation in the First Half of the Day Was Not Purely Firm, and the Ups and Downs in the Middle Were Extremely Troublesome. In the Early Morning, Although the Big Overseas Silver Market Was Showing a Slight Contraction, Its Footing Was Unfavorable.

Although There Was a Decline, Chinese Merchants Still Had an Appetite for Buying. HSBC's Listing Did Not Move, and People's Hearts Were Firm, So It Could Still Be Pulled Up. It Was Just Hovering. However, Because the Domestic Market Was in a State of Bank's Blocking the Near-Term U.S. Dollar, It Hardened Once, and the Gold Market Also Temporarily Weakened.

After the opening, banks showed little appetite, but thanks to the support of Chinese merchants, the quoted rates for both the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) remained unchanged. The market situation was still stable. After entering the market, it hardened once, but ultimately, due to firm confidence, it was difficult to cause change. Generally, banks bought far-term and sold near-term, but only Chinese merchants bought near-term. As a result, the market slightly tightened. The noon closing price for near-term pound sterling was 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 0.5625 farthings, and the U.S. dollar was 35.125 yuan, stronger by 0.0625 for the pound and 0.125 for the dollar compared to the previous close. After the market closed, unfavorable news came out, and the market situation became looser. Chinese merchants still bought near-term and sold far-term, rolling over approximately 200,000 to 300,000 U.S. dollars, and selling 50,000 pounds sterling. Banks supplied generously. A record of the half-day's transactions follows:</p>
<p>The pound sterling market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price at 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 0.625 farthings. Yokohama Specie Bank, Dai-Etsu, and East Asia sold to HSBC September lower half month at 0.6875. Citibank bought October at 0.625. Mitsui took November at 0.6875. East Asia came out at December 0.75.

<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market was quieter than the past few days, as it was the weekend and foreign firms and banks were mostly only open for half a day. The market interest for silver dollar loans remained at 7% for both the morning and afternoon sessions, while surcharges on top of the base rate decreased by 1%, making the effective interest rate 3%. The volume of transactions for drafts was generally the same. It is estimated that over 3.3 million was transacted in the morning session and 200,000+ in the afternoon session. Transactions in the Small General Association totaled 300,000+. The volume of silver dollar-secured loans and redemptions totaled only 1.3 million. The volume of bank deposits and remittances decreased by almost one-third compared to usual. It is estimated that foreign banks deposited and remitted 1.2 million in drafts and 2.9 million in various merchandise and foreign exchange-secured loans and miscellaneous remittances, with 300,000 withdrawn from warehouses. Due to the sluggish business in recent years, Chinese banks have made many changes to old practices, not only remaining open as usual on weekend afternoons but even not taking holidays on some Sunday mornings. Therefore, the impact was less. It is estimated that they deposited and remitted 2.0+ million in drafts, 400,000+ in customs duties, and 3.7+ million in various merchandise, foreign exchange-secured loans, and miscellaneous remittances, with 200,000 withdrawn from warehouses. Japanese banks deposited and remitted 1.5+ million in drafts and 2.3+ million in various merchandise, foreign exchange-secured loans, and miscellaneous remittances, with 300,000 withdrawn from warehouses. Money shops deposited and remitted 43.3+ million in silver dollar public notes, 3.2+ million in silver dollar surcharges, 1.1+ million in banknotes collected and issued, 30,000+ in remittances from various locations, 70,000+ in cash received, and 20,000 each for incoming and outgoing customer flows. Furthermore, the total value of clearing at the city's clearing house on the 11th was 8,083,135.89 silver dollars, including 3,456,048.06 silver dollars and 4,627,087.83 silver dollars in exchange transfers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver coins were 835 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, slightly down by 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was only 2,000 in the morning and none in the afternoon. The Guangdong small silver coins were 727.7 yuan in the morning, down by 0.02 yuan, and rebounded by 0.03 yuan in the afternoon to 728 yuan, resulting in a mere 0.01 yuan improvement compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 90,000 in the morning and 30,000 in the afternoon. Copper coins were 333,000 cash, slightly up by 500 cash compared to the previous day, with a transaction price of 9,600 yuan, equivalent to 31,968 strings of cash.</p>

<p>| Dropping by two to six jiao |</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the deteriorating situation in Yuguan, the Northern faction's intention to short sell remained strong, and selling pressure was still prevalent in the market. The decline was greater than before. In fact, there was no problem in Yuguan. People were inevitably oversensitive. Moreover, Huang Fu has left the mountain and will go north soon. There should be progress on the Sino-Japanese North China issue. There is no reason for further decline. Only because more floating capital came out and new short sellers are actively participating, the pressure is still heavy. Longs wanted to capture and release, absorbing on a small scale. The resistance is not far away. Yesterday's process: The opening was uniformly soft, and No. 1, No. 5, No. 35, etc., were all sold off. Market prices fell, from a little over 0.1 yuan to as much as 0.55 yuan, with salt tax falling the most. The second session was still lifeless, and the front rows continued to weaken, continuing to decline by a little over 0.1 yuan. Since the unified salt tax, it has become slightly firmer, recovering by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The situation on the table temporarily appears soft and should not cause a falling wind. The market price resulted in a drop of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, with the most being a little over 0.6 yuan. The total transaction volume was 10,007,500 yuan. The results of its highs, lows, and ups and downs are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to a report by Sin Fung &amp; Co., yesterday (the 10th), stock market trading turned dull again. The excitement of the previous day's silver development on Wall Street has been lost. Those taking profits sold, and prices fell. Speculators clearly misinterpreted the previous day's nationalization of silver. And they purchased too many silver mine stocks, because the selling price of new ore silver is still 64.5 cents and has not changed. The government's nationalization of silver is actually not profitable for silver mines. Industrial and commercial news is mixed. The export volume of U.S. Steel in July was slightly less than generally expected. The Small Exchange varied slightly lower. The bond market was also lifeless. U.S. government bonds traded briskly, falling about half a dollar. Railroad bonds fell, while industrial and utility bonds rose slightly. Foreign bonds were generally slightly higher. What is different is that Chicago wheat also fell with the stock market. This is because the harvest report is about to be released, and the bulls are taking profits. The total daily turnover was 770,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>Yarn Exchange Resumes After-Market Trading Next Week</p>
<p>The yarn market is flat and weak. Due to large-scale hedging sales by manufacturers, market sentiment is slightly weak. However, spot yarn sales are good, and purchases by various merchants are smooth. Therefore, the spot yarn situation is becoming increasingly tight, so spot yarn is expected to rise in the near term. Far-month mill hedging sales naturally lower prices. The near-term and far-term prices can be slightly leveled out. From the perspective of actual needs, the yarn market is unlikely to fall sharply. The Yarn Exchange will resume regular afternoon trading starting tomorrow.</p>

<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market this morning, the price of American cotton fell, and the atmosphere in the field eased. There were not many buyers. The far-month suddenly fell by 0.6 yuan. By the second and third sessions, it was heard that the spot yarn sales market was still smooth, and shorts were actively covering. The near-month was tighter, but the far-month was weaker due to hedging sales by the mills. As a result, the near-month rose by 0.1 to 0.4 yuan, and the far-month fell by 0.3 yuan. The transaction volume totaled 28,800 bales. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,500 bales, Taixing 2,900 bales, Yicheng 950 bales, Changfeng 850 bales, Yongchang 650 bales, and Deji 700 bales. Yuanda bought 650 bales, Jinchang 600 bales, Changji 550 bales, Junchang 1,400 bales, Shenji 1,300 bales, Yida 1,150 bales, Yuantai 950 bales, Yichang 1,200 bales, and Hengchang 750 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales are still smooth. It was found that the total purchase by various merchants throughout the day was 1,600 bales. Market conditions are trending upward. The purchase amounts for each merchant are as follows:</p>

<p>Domestic Cotton Production Expected to Have a Bumper Harvest</p>
<h3 id="e282">Marked Cotton Sales Pressure is Quite High <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market continued to weaken, and the situation was quite weak. With too many sellers, the pressure increased. In addition, American cotton fell slightly, and the shorts' intentions became stronger. According to cotton industry insiders, most opinions are that domestic production is expected to have a bumper harvest this year. The acreage has increased significantly compared to last year. It is difficult to view the new cotton market as high. Therefore, there are fewer new buyers, and the market is more relaxed.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Zheng Standard Continues to Fall by 0.35 Yuan <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the marked cotton morning session, the price of American cotton fell by 20 points, and there was news of rain in the drought-stricken area. There was a lack of buyers in the field, and shorts added to their sales, making the pressure even greater. The market gradually declined. According to general rumors, a certain firm sold off a large amount the day before, preparing to receive goods at the production area for delivery. Secondly, the cotton production conditions in various places are currently excellent. If there are no changes in the weather in the future, the market price is expected to fall significantly. Therefore, the atmosphere of shorting is particularly strong in the market. However, regarding foreign cotton, domestic cotton is unlikely to fall sharply either. As a result, each month fell by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The transaction volume totaled 88,800 dan. It was found that Yudai sold 1,700 dan, Jinchang 2,200 dan, Taixing 1,400 dan, Huikang 2,500 dan, Shenchang 8,200 dan, Yuandai 2,500 dan, Renfeng 2,400 dan, Yuan Yi 3,400 dan, Changfeng 1,800 dan, Runkang 3,700 dan, Xiesheng 1,600 dan, and Changhe 2,000 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was flat. Prices initially fell due to rain in the drought area, and then rose due to purchases by U.S. merchants in Liverpool. As a result, they fell by 17-20 points. At the same time, the Liverpool cotton market was weak. The U.S. cotton standard fell by 5 points. Bombay cotton futures were slightly bought, and the market was stable, rising or falling by half a rupee to 1.5 rupees. The telegrams are recorded below:</p>

<p>Increased Grain Margin Has Had a Restrictive Effect</p>
<h3 id="e286">Flour Futures Gradually Return to Normal <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>Flour Margin to be Changed to $500 Starting Next Week</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the markets for each month showed a trend of first falling and then stabilizing. Since the price of foreign wheat reported from Chicago fell by 0.03, 0.04, or 0.05 yuan and similar from Canada, the opening price for the current month was 2.725 yuan, and September was 7.3 yuan, which was 0.03 or 0.04 lower than the previous day. However, the market for December and later months showed a steady trend. By the time the second session started, the customer help was slightly improved, and the market sentiment was still stable. Buying was seen when the value was low, so the sentiment in each month improved again. By the time the afternoon session opened, the markets for each month had shown a hovering trend. Buyers and sellers were mostly watching and waiting. Factories released slightly, while customers entered slightly. The situation had entered a stable phase. Since the exchange gradually increased the margin for outside speculators (from 250 yuan to 750 yuan), those without the strength had no choice but to wait and see. This has also had a great impact on the recent stabilization of the market. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, September improved by 0.015 yuan, October improved by 0.0075 yuan, November improved by 0.02 yuan, and December and January improved by 0.015 yuan. Starting next week, the flour exchange will change the margin for both buyers and sellers to 500 yuan. In the future, if the market becomes more stable, it will be restored to its original state. It is reported that the market has been announced.</p>
<h3 id="e287">Wheat Futures Bulls Emerge <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>| Grain Exchange Brokers Propose Reducing Margin |</p>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, the markets for each month showed a situation of near-term weakness and far-term stability. The prices of foreign wheat reported from both Chicago and Canada fell by 0.03, 0.04, or 0.05 yuan. When it first opened, the market sentiment was generally stable, and transactions were also quiet. The opening price for the near-term was 0.01 or 0.02 yuan lower than the previous day. The far-term, such as November, actually improved by 0.03 or 0.04 yuan. By the time the afternoon session opened, it initially appeared calm, but later, as the bulls returned and new buyers hesitated to move forward, the opening prices for each month fell by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. This situation is also due to the increase in the margin, which has invisibly restricted speculative activities. As a result, August fell by 0.06 yuan, September fell by 0.08 yuan, October fell by 0.06 yuan, November fell by 0.02 yuan, and December fell by 0.05 yuan. Large wheat mills unanimously held firm, and the market did not open for trading. Brokers at the miscellaneous grains exchange have reportedly made a proposal to the exchange authorities regarding the margin because the market is gradually stabilizing. If the wheat market is within 0.2 yuan, the margin will still be changed to 280 yuan. If it is outside of 0.2 yuan, it will be changed to 400 yuan. The soybean oil margin is proposed to be changed to 210 yuan. However, it will only be determined next week whether the exchange will allow it.</p>

<h3 id="e288">Foreign Rice and Rice from All Locations Arrive in Large Quantities <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>New Rice Arrives and Yangtze Merchants Stop Purchasing</p>
<p>Late Rice Suffers Drought Wuxi Storing Merchants Purchase</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was quite lively, with good arrivals and sales, and very active transactions. In addition to the Saigon orders, a batch of Annam short-grain rice transferred from Hong Kong arrived yesterday. 549 packages were opened at the market price. Customer purchases of early-season rice were all listed. Due to the high price in Shanghai, it is likely to attract distant goods. Recently, the new rice harvest in various parts of Anhui has been excellent. In addition to the rice transported by train from Mingguang and Chuzhou, 500 packages of unpolished rice from Ningguo Prefecture and 500 packages of rice from Ruian were shipped for the first time yesterday. Both were opened at the market price. Also, the new unpolished rice from Shashi also arrived in port yesterday. With the gradual arrival of new rice from various locations, and the fact that the Yangtze merchants from Jiujiang and Hankou were not interested and the Northern Ocean merchants had also stopped buying, the market could have fallen back. However, it was suddenly purchased again by inland merchants yesterday because the inland areas were suffering from drought, which was affecting the late rice. The inland areas, such as the Huning, Huhang, and Yong routes, were still optimistic. Therefore, rice shops in Wuxi again commissioned local storage customers to come to Shanghai to purchase foreign rice from various locations, accounting for over 3,000 packages of Hunan and Anhui rice. Other inland merchants purchased 1,700 packages of customer rice, 1,000 packages of foreign rice, and local merchants also purchased 3,000+ packages of foreign rice. The market price returned to flat yesterday. The small-size short-grain rice fell to 10.34 yuan, the machine-polished Jing rice was 10.068 yuan, and the Shashi machine-polished rice was 9.83 yuan. However, unpolished rice attracted attention from inland areas and showed a firm appearance. The number one new Saigon spot goods was limited, reaching 12 yuan yesterday. The newly arrived Annam rice was actually equal to Saigon rice, so it was only opened at 11.6 yuan and 11.2 yuan. Ruian machine-polished rice was opened at 10 yuan, and Ningguo Prefecture unpolished rice was opened at 8.65 yuan to 8.35 yuan, which were all first seen in the market.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for various merchant groups was more than 20 (approximately 3,000+ shi of goods). The sales route was slightly active, and the price also improved by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The Qingdao merchant group's purchases turned balanced, only handling one shipment of green corner special goods, about 110+ packages, so the market trend remained weak. The price of each thick glutinous rice increased by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The late rice increased by about 0.1 yuan. The supply and demand for Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan were similar, with no great profit or loss. The new glutinous rice was still opened at 11.2 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 11-12 sources of goods from various places in Hexia. The sales of various goods in the market continued to move. However, the transactions of white yuan were flat. The market shape, the price of white glutinous rice and early rice increased by 0.1-0.2 yuan, the price of sheep's tip increased by 0.1+ yuan, customer's tips were closer to a foot, thin rice was tight, and the remaining goods were stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign-operated tea market, the Russian Cooperative Foreign Firm reopened purchases of Keemun and Fuliang black teas due to overseas telephone demand. The entire city traded more than 1,000 boxes, with selling prices ranging from 50 yuan to 80 yuan, with not much change from before. As for green teas from Pingshui and other locations, there was no major progress in the market. The only teas being sold were those from Shexian, such as Pearl Tea and low-quality Needle Eyebrow and Show Eyebrow teas. The market was slightly more active. The transactions for other teas, such as Zhenmei and Da Bang, were still sparse.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the sugar market, although the customs gold slightly increased, it was Saturday and there were no ships loading today, so transactions were very quiet. The guild's listing price for No. 24 coarse sugar and white spot goods was 19.8 yuan, but it was not completed. The price for delivery at the dock was 19.82 yuan, with some transactions. The price for ordinary Dutch red sugar was 15.3 yuan. The futures price for Dachang opened down 0.1 yuan, and the firm wanted to lower it further. A telegram had already been sent to inquire and decide, but there was no reply, so it was likely that the trend would not be realized. Taikoo sugar fell slightly by 0.05 yuan, with Yimark being 20.3 yuan and CW Mark being 20 yuan. The price of Zhenyu's local factory's White B fell by 0.05 yuan, with No. 1 being 18.8 yuan.

<h3 id="e293">Labor and Interest <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Anfu</p>
<p>When we are born into this world crying, Heaven endows us with five senses and four limbs. This is sufficient proof that we humans are not born into this world to enjoy leisure, but to labor. Since our human duty is to labor, then we should recognize the goals of labor, discern right from wrong, and good from evil. We must use all the strength of our lives, without discouragement or interruption, and strive forward. Only in this way will we have a day of success! However, the facts tell us that humans are animals with life and emotions, so the environment and personality, etc., all have a considerable relationship with humans. Therefore, when we engage in a certain kind of labor for a long time, we often develop a kind of aversion and produce a feeling of dislike for the occupation or a state of mind disliking it. The growth of this kind of mentality or state is most likely to hinder the progress of labor invisibly, resulting in a decrease in productivity. Moreover, this will not only make the employer who hires you feel that your ability to handle affairs has declined, but from your own point of view, you will also feel boredom and pain.</p>
<p>What medicine can cure or eliminate this dangerous disease? In fact, the occurrence of this disease can simply be said to have no medicine to cure it; if there is one, it is interest. Carlyle said, "We most welcome those who sing while working." Xu Mi also said, "Ordinary people who hold optimism about anything in the world are better than those who have a thousand gold income every year." The so-called singing person and optimistic person here are actually people who are full of interest in their hearts when they work! Here, we can also randomly cite a person as a representative, such as Smith (Sydney Smith 1770-1845). He was a British pastor and also a famous writer. But how did he succeed? We can see in his letter to his daughter: "The position I am in now was not what I originally chose, but since I have engaged in it, then I can also feel at ease and like it; because this is much more manly than those who think highly of themselves and want to dislike their occupation." This kind of lack of a fixed standard for choosing a career is not an appropriate thing; however, being able to generate interest in labor is indeed something worthy of our emulation. At the same time, he liked to say throughout his life: "Let us glorify the room." His meaning is that people should abandon darkness and let in sunlight; that is to say, in the labor of life, one should try to abandon the boring and tasteless page, and should try to promote the interesting side of labor. From this point of view, the reason why Smith was able to succeed and enjoy fame was also produced by the harmony of labor and interest.</p>
<p>Looking at everything in China today, whether it is the country, society, or individual life, a phenomenon of economic depression can be seen almost everywhere. However, if everyone can follow their duties, not sigh, not frown, and work hard without negativity, as if using sweat to restrain us, and at the same time try to find interest in labor as the driving force for our struggle, then in less than ten years, I believe that everything at that time must be stronger than it is now. You only need to look at Japan as a good example for our country, and Smith and Edison are good role models for us as human beings.</p>
<p>In short, life should be about laboring, and it is an inevitable trend to feel bored and dull with labor; however, it depends on whether you can find interest in the boring and dull life as a stimulant. Because only the interest gained from boredom is true interest. It will continue forever, as long as your life; and its benefits to us humans cannot be described in words or writing.</p>

<h3 id="e294">Film Critic <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Liren</p>
<p>Although film criticism has long been popular in Europe and the United States, it must be said that its awakening and widespread attention in China only occurred after the January 28th Incident. After the January 28th Incident, Chinese films have made considerable progress, which is visible to everyone. This is mostly thanks to the "gifts" of the Japanese imperialist cannons; however, the efforts of film critics in helping the growth of new Chinese films should not be ignored. Film criticism was originally a record of audience opinions; filmmakers who take profit-making as their sole purpose naturally dare not ignore this valuable opinion and go down a dead end. Today, the films of talented scholars and beautiful ladies, and the martial arts films with flying swords, have been spurned by a vast audience; the mission of film has been recognized as a weapon to fight for the freedom and liberation of the broad masses and the nation, rather than a pastime exclusively for those who have leisure. This recognition of the great function of film is undoubtedly promoted by the efforts of film critics.</p>
<p>Because film criticism is valued and welcomed by the broad audience, newspapers, in order to compete for their readers, have had to compete to publish film journals and carry film reviews; as a result, some people with artistic cultivation and film knowledge have appeared and been valued as "film critics." Here, I want to go on to briefly describe their lifestyle.</p>
<p>First, I want to mention the "remuneration" they can obtain from the newspaper. Generally, newspapers have two methods of paying film critics: by word count and by article. If calculated by word count, the remuneration per thousand words can be roughly divided into six levels, namely, five yuan, four yuan, three yuan, two yuan, one and a half yuan, and one yuan per thousand words. It cannot be said that the difference between these numbers is quite large. The reason for this is mostly due to the difference in the newspaper's film advertising revenue and its economic capacity; a small part, however, is that some newspapers have different methods of paying special contributors with higher status and ordinary contributors. For example, a certain newspaper pays three yuan per thousand words for special film contributions, while only one yuan and fifty cents per thousand words for ordinary film contributions. Larger newspapers generally pay no less than five to four yuan per thousand words to special film critics with status; ordinary film critics are paid only three yuan and two yuan per thousand words. (The above refers to different newspapers.) Smaller newspapers probably pay a maximum of three yuan per thousand words to special film critics; it is also very common to pay two yuan or one and a half yuan per thousand words, and it is not entirely non-existent to pay only one yuan per thousand words.</p>
<p>If calculated by the article (this refers specifically to "film reviews" of a certain film), the highest price a film critic can get for racking their brains after watching a film is probably only three yuan, and the least will not</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>be less than two yuan. Some are paid two yuan and fifty cents per article. In addition, since the minimum prices of the top theaters in this city are one yuan, six jiao, and five jiao respectively, the newspaper generally pays a few jiao more to film critics who spend more money on watching movies.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the remuneration is calculated by word count or by article, the cost of watching movies is generally borne by the film critics themselves. However, artists have always been poor friends, and unfortunately, film critics are no exception. When they cannot afford it themselves, they may have to pre-pay some movie money from the newspaper or the person in charge, or even pre-pay some manuscript fees. But this situation is very rare and uncommon.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about the possible monthly income of an average film critic. This depends on the amount of remuneration and whether they have enough time to write. It is not entirely a fantasy to earn as much as two hundred yuan per month if one gets high remuneration and writes a lot; one hundred and several tens of yuan is not entirely impossible for such people. We know that in addition to writing "film reviews," film critics also have to write film essays, miscellaneous feelings, reviews, and other film review texts, as well as play reviews in related art theater, and sometimes even write poems, novels, and sketches to occupy a place in journals and newspapers to share a part of the manuscript fees. By piecing together all kinds of income, the result of their racking their brains can sometimes be quite considerable. But such people are a very small minority. Most people earn only thirty or forty yuan per month, and some can only earn ten or twenty yuan per month. This is mostly because they produce little and receive low remuneration.</p>
<p>Regarding "film reviews," I would like to say a few more words. Generally, newspapers have fixed and non-fixed arrangements for the theaters where film critics watch movies. Some are assigned to watch a certain theater exclusively, and some are decided on a temporary basis and notified to each film critic by telephone. As for the number of film critics in each newspaper, I would also like to mention it. Generally, the number of special film critics in each newspaper is usually no more than three to five people, and there are not many more than that, although it does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Now I want to go on to talk about the origins of these film critics. Most of them are people in the film industry, the drama industry, and the literary world, and occasionally a few members of the civilized drama faction and the mandarin duck butterfly faction are also involved. Some practitioners in the film industry who have insufficient income or even unemployment are very eager to find their way out from the field of film criticism; sometimes there are also some publicists employed by certain production companies and related people who come out to write wonderful articles that boast about themselves. These critics in the drama and literary circles, because most of them have a deeper literary cultivation and richer life experience, although they may not be 100% experts in film, their understanding of film art and their enthusiastic research, as an appreciative critic, their valuable opinions contributed to the new Chinese film and the audience are well worth noting. As for those backward film critics of the civilized drama faction and the mandarin duck butterfly faction who specialize in praising thighs and breasts and other erotic scenes and who take low-level interests as the first meaning, they have long declined with the decline of the love films of talented scholars and beautiful ladies and the martial arts films with flying swords, and have long been forgotten by the vast and progressive audience. For example, in the recent debate between soft theorists and film realists, they lost the sympathy of the audience and did not gain people's favor.</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I would like to mention some new ways out for some film critics. Writing film reviews is ultimately a very hard work. If there are better jobs to do, some film critics will lower their status and sell their knowledge. They may be recruited by a film company, and in exchange for remuneration, they can manipulate film reviews and create some unwarranted news to promote inferior films and sell their efforts for the profit of the boss. They may have the title of publicist, or they may only get some subsidies from the boss. For example, a certain film company that specializes in shoddy manufacturing often engages in this kind of buying-up of trivial newspapers that publish film articles and trivial film critics who often write low-level interest articles. Some film critics are hired to be the editors of film publications, and some are specially invited to write film articles in some radical film journals, and some are even hired by film companies to be consultants. (Those who are consultants naturally have a more sufficient literary cultivation.)</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to mention the hardships of film critics. Living by writing is the most difficult kind of life, and I think writing film reviews is an even more difficult kind of life. Most of them do not have an income above maintaining life, but their cost is twice that of other writers. Film review articles are mostly "rushed" out or "forced" out. We know that each theater opens at three o'clock and closes at five o'clock. After the closing, they must set aside everything to write review articles; no matter how bad a film is, no matter whether you have any opinions on the film, you must send a thousand or several hundred words to the editor around eight o'clock. You have to watch bad films that you don't want to watch or that make people want to fall asleep; you have to write texts that you don't want to write and that are difficult to write well. There is a huge whip beating you, and you must search your brains and hand in an article. It is common to see some film critics still staring at a blank piece of paper in a long three or four hours, their writing is sluggish. Like a difficult delivery of a pregnant woman. This kind of hardship of "forcing" writing is only understood by those who have written film reviews. What is its meaning.</p>

<p>— Ms. Xiangjun</p>
<p>Plato said: "No matter how difficult it is, never beg for pity from others, because begging for pity contains an element of contempt." Therefore, I pressed my heart into steel, enduring labor and resentment, enduring hunger and cold, struggling alone under the miserable wind and rain, and enduring all the disasters of the world. Although tears were floating in my eyes and spinning around, I swallowed them into my throat, swallowing them as the bitter juice of life, and never wept in front of cold-blooded people!</p>
<p>However, in this deformed society, a poor woman without a background and without a backer, exchanges bread with her own labor. Even if she is born with an iron bone, and is exploited and has her bones crushed and marrow sucked, even so, clothing and food may not necessarily be warm and full, and in the end, she cannot avoid the danger of unemployment! Ah, I really don't know what kind of human relationship-organized society this is?</p>
<p>It has been two years since I lost my job. I am wandering and my eyes are empty. When I think of the insults and arrogance that lonely people without social status suffer when they ask for help, it will plunge the whole soul into sadness, and the courage to survive will also decline because of this. Therefore, in this long period of unemployment, I only closed the door of the pavilion, preparing to sit and wait for death, gazing at the passing of spring and summer, and the hurried changes of the seasons, panicking like an ox trapped in a mud pit, rolling around in the mud pit, and dazed!</p>
<p>In the early morning, I woke up from a bitter dream, stroking the scars all over my body. The tragic life of the past was thrown into my heart more forcefully than anything else. After struggling for more than thirty years, what did I get from being cruelly tortured in the world? I can't even maintain a person's most basic life! Alas! What can human affairs be imagined? I only feel that crying and laughing are both wrong! I was like a wounded and wailing beast, collapsing and falling, and no longer had the strength to move!</p>
<p>At this time, I imagined the situation when the last-day writers threw themselves into the sea, such as the situation when Zhu Xiangwei Yanchi and others despaired and decided to sink. Alas! What a great temptation this is to me! In this way, I always feel that it is stronger and more tragic than begging for pity in front of cold-blooded people.</p>
<p>But wise readers! I have an old parent with white hair waiting for me in the corner of my hometown! Her poor old age makes me have to cheer up and be a human being for a few more days. Ah, I didn't expect her ability to be so great!</p>
<p>Because of this relationship, I am forced to write this article, wanting to exchange my labor for a cup of leftovers from the charitable people in society. Although I have no special skills, continuous labor is the model of my past life. For more than ten years, I have worked as a female worker in factories and teachers in family schools. Now, whatever I can do, I am willing to do, as long as there is a position. Correspondence address: c/o Mr. Chen, No. 23, Huayuanfang, Jinshenfu Road.</p>

<h3 id="e296">Examples of How to Read "Literature" <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>(1) How to read novels?</p>
<p>Because it is the same literary work, depending on its different forms, whether it is a novel or a drama, naturally the way to read it cannot be the same. But here we will temporarily take the novel as a representative, and let the readers deduce the special points themselves!</p>
<p>Mr. Yin Zuozhen, in his article on how to read novels, once proposed the following outline for reading "Wei Hu": (1) the story told in this novel; (2) the protagonist's thoughts (its transformation and development process); (3) the social basis of the protagonist's ideological transformation; (4) the author's consciousness reflected in this novel; (5) the social life form of that era expressed in this novel; (6) what are the characteristics of formal technology? Which school does it belong to? Is this formal technology consistent with its content pulse? I think this outline is more correct, and it is almost applicable to literary works of all forms, not only to reading novels. Although the second to fifth items are not conditions that are available in every work, they can always be found in each work in part or in whole, which is undoubtedly the case. The first and sixth are questions about form.</p>
<p>We must perform the above anatomy on a work before it can be said to be a scientific way of reading. If we only do the first step, only pay attention to the plot in the work, only have interest in the event, and do not ask about anything else, that is the so-called "lowest-level appreciation." If you focus on savoring the beauty of the work's words, tones, structure, and expression, and don't ask about anything else, that is the work of old literati who play with words. It is not a scientific method of studying literature. Both of the above methods are not enough.</p>
<p>Only the reader who performs the second to fifth tasks has grasped the center of the problem, which is almost the central condition of all literary works.</p>
<p>(2) How to perform the above reading method?</p>
<p>Naturally, we cannot say that the problem has been solved even if we memorize the above reading method. How do we perform this reading method?</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, its process is as follows:</p>
<p>First, browse through the selected work as quickly as possible to get a preliminary understanding of the general outline of the whole book or the whole article, and find out the main characters, the center of the story, and the development clues in the article. In this stage, it is probably enough to use your eyes.</p>
<p>Second, when examining the protagonist's thoughts in the story, you not only use your brain, but also your hands. You should record all the words spoken by the protagonist before and after and his personal inner thoughts, compare them with each other, and find out the route of development. This part of the work is very difficult to do. Some people read "Water Margin" and draw out the faces of the 108 heroes one by one, spending a lot of effort to compare. This is necessary, and at the same time, there cannot be any subjective likes and dislikes. If the protagonist's thoughts are contradictory before and after, if the author does not write it out for another meaning, then it can be concluded that the author's failure.</p>
<p>Third, in fact, this stage is carried out simultaneously with the second stage. After reading the protagonist's ideological transformation, we must further find its basis. For this, you must thoroughly understand the protagonist's social life. You should focus on the reality of society. If the protagonist's ideological transformation has no basis, then the work must be a failure. The so-called basis for ideological change is probably based on his social class, the contradictions between social groups at that time, political and economic panic, large riots, revolutions, hunger, and other phenomena.</p>
<p>Fourth, conduct an examination of the author's consciousness reflected in the work. This is not limited to this article. We should also find more biographies of the author, other works, and his actual living conditions to help us understand this article. This stage can be easily carried out when you have a considerable understanding of the author on weekdays.</p>
<p>Fifth, as for the review of the social life form of that era expressed in this work, this should have an undistorted understanding, an objective point of view, social enthusiasm, and a distance from the public, of the current international and domestic political and economic situation, the state of confrontation between social groups, and domestic and world events. This all depends on paying attention to the forms of social life at all levels on weekdays. Of course, if you do not have a little understanding of the times, you will not be able to understand the times of the work. The review of this stage is linked to the entire social periphery. It is impossible to go to society only to read a work. In this, we can also see not only how the author, but also how the reader should increase their life experience.</p>
<p>Sixth, regarding the technical review, this part requires readers to carefully understand it using scientific analysis methods. Originally, the so-called technology was also created by writers unconsciously. But the past experience is precious, we should accept the legacy of the previous era. The application of this stage is to read more, watch more, cut the whole article into several parts, and then form the whole from the parts, and observe from all aspects. Regarding this aspect, it is best to read more specialized books of this kind.</p>
<p>From the second to the sixth above, we must not only use our eyes, but also our hands, our mouths, and even our feet to visit everywhere. Therefore, reading literary books is by no means an easy task; it is by no means something that can be achieved in such a leisurely attitude as lying on a "sofa."</p>

<h3 id="e297">Sports in Prison <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Li Kui</p>
<p>Prisoners in prison also need exercise during their leisure time after work. They also know that physical exercise is as important as eating and sleeping.</p>
<p>However, unlike outside, where some people are chosen to stand out; there are no such things as athletes, champions, or mermaids.</p>
<p>They are limited by their environment, confined to small, dark cells, and have no opportunity to exercise.</p>
<p>But in order to prevent their health from deteriorating further, leading to illness and death, they have to exercise within a small space.</p>
<p>Their exercises can be roughly divided into four types:</p>
<p>The first type is "hitting hands." This is the most common exercise. Every time after a meal, some young prisoners gather together to "hit hands."</p>
<p>This "hitting hands" exercise is done like this: there must be several people participating. After joining, each person extends one hand and places it together. At the same time, another person randomly says a number. They count according to the order, and whoever counts to the last number is the first to be "hit."</p>
<p>The person to be "hit" must stand in front, put their left hand under their right shoulder, with the palm facing outwards, properly placed between the armpit and the back, waiting for the person standing behind to "hit." The person behind must "hit" skillfully. After the "hit," the person who was "hit" immediately turns around to guess who "hit" them. If guessed correctly, the guesser takes over the "hitting." If guessed incorrectly, the person still turns back to be "hit."</p>
<p>This "hitting hands" exercise not only strengthens the body but also develops judgment. It is truly one of the best exercises in prison.</p>
<p>The second type is "playing ball." This is not very common, and only prisoners who have lived in schools play it.</p>
<p>The balls they use are not the leather balls used outside. Leather balls are not allowed inside. The balls they use are made of rice.</p>
<p>Every day at mealtime, those who love to play ball always secretly save a handful of rice. Even if there is very little rice, they would rather eat one less bite themselves and still save a handful.</p>
<p>They slowly rub the saved rice finely with their hands, like smooth noodles. Afterwards, they knead it into round rice balls. After letting them dry for a while, when thrown against the wall, they become very bouncy and can bounce back immediately like a rubber ball.</p>
<p>This way, they can have a competition. Whoever participates comes up to "hit" in order, like playing tennis. Whoever "games" immediately comes down, and the second person continues to "hit."</p>
<p>This "playing ball" exercise is also a good exercise for prisoners. However, sometimes problems arise. If the rice ball is seen by the warden, they will be scolded, and that's not all. The rice ration will also be reduced immediately. The reason is wasting rice!</p>
<p>The third type is running. In winter, when it is unbearably cold and there is no way to get warm in the tattered bedding, they have to "dance" in the cell at night -- actually, they are not dancing. They have never danced before, and they have never even been to those grand dance halls. They are just jumping around to keep warm, a euphemism. During the day, they run in the alley. Whenever they start running, almost all the prisoners in the entire alley participate, except for a few old men with weak legs standing in the doorway watching.</p>
<p>One after another, they run back and forth in that alley, which is about twenty steps long and two or three feet wide. They don't rest until they are sweating.</p>
<p>This exercise is sometimes interfered with because the sound of running footsteps is too loud. The military police will run to the entrance of the alley and roar angrily while knocking on the iron gate.</p>
<p>The fourth type is swimming. This exercise also borrows a term. There is no swimming pool in prison, so how can they swim? Isn't this borrowing a term?</p>
<p>This is when they are unbearably hot, they use wooden basins to hold water and splash each other in the alley, making a noisy commotion, which is like swimming.</p>
<p>This exercise is just a disguised bath. This exercise is even more often subject to interference. But because they are unbearably hot, they know they will be scolded or even beaten, but they still splash each other as before.</p>
<p>These few exercises in prison are very pitiful! If you compare them with exercises outside, there is a world of difference!</p>
<p>Being limited by their environment, they can do this much, which is very satisfying. Moreover, these exercises are universal. Their exercises are for everyone's health, not just for a few people to show off.</p>

<h3 id="e300">The Story of the Invention of the Airship (9) <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Lin</p>
<p>The successful Zeppelin of 1905 had a volume of 11,300 cubic meters, which was unprecedentedly large. It was 128 meters long, 11 meters in diameter at its widest point, equipped with two 85-horsepower engines, and had a speed of 11 meters per second.</p>
<p>People who previously had antipathy towards Zeppelin all reversed their previous attitude and became admirers.</p>
<p>Later, the Zeppelin Airship Company was established, manufacturing airships in large quantities. From 1900 to 1924, a total of 129 ships were built. Among them, 48 belonged to the army, 65 belonged to the navy, and the rest were used for non-military purposes.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Zeppelin airships established great achievements for Germany during the European War. However, the world knows very little about Zeppelin's arduous struggles. Seven of the airships Zeppelin built himself were destroyed by storms and fires. However, each failure encouraged Zeppelin with new energy, like a tumbler, repeatedly falling and rising. When we understand the career of this gray-haired old man, how will it stimulate our new feelings?</p>
<p>In 1913, when Zeppelin celebrated his 75th birthday, all of Germany celebrated together, and a grand celebration was held in Friedrichshafen. At that time, the German Emperor sent the following congratulatory message to Zeppelin:</p>
<p>"The existence of the brave and great man who conquered the sky is the honor of the German Empire!"</p>
<p>Indeed, not only the German Emperor, but all the German people were proud of Zeppelin. The value and structure of Zeppelin-type airships are set aside for the moment; his life itself is already a representative of the German soul.</p>
<p>5. Zeppelin-type Airship's Night Raid on London</p>
<p>Finally, let us talk about the story of the Zeppelin-type airship's night raid on London.</p>
<p>German Air Force Commander Colonel Moltke made the following remarks about the night raid on London. Colonel Moltke himself was a person who personally experienced the night raid on London by airship.</p>
<p>"The citizens of London are afraid of our Zeppelin's attack. They do not light a lamp at night and prohibit the use of matches on the streets. However, we do not find this difficult. The airship came to the sky above London, which happened to be a starry and moonlit night. There was no fog on the streets of London, and a layer of hazy curtain enveloped it. Under this curtain, the entire London slept quietly, and my heart beat strangely hard. The Thames River reflected the twilight of the sky, reflecting a silver-gray light. We dropped the bombs we brought. Parking lots and bridges were the most targeted by our snipers, and at the same time, we prayed that we would not hurt non-combatant women and children (note: this statement is completely contradictory)."

<h3 id="e301">Hollywood's Star School <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Mi Qi</p>
<p>Many Talents Emerge from its Doors and Walls; the School Declares This is Not a Shortcut to Success</p>
<p>This school is not called the Hollywood Star School, but because it is located in Hollywood, the world's film capital, and many of its graduates are famous in the film industry, everyone calls that school the School of Stars. In fact, its name is Hollywood High School. Now I will talk about some things about this school.</p>
<p>There are no less than tens of millions of primary and secondary schools in the United States. Among them, there are no less than millions of school-age children who are thinking about entering the film industry in the future. Every year, countless children, both male and female, from far and near, run to Hollywood, wanting to try their skills. Almost all of them are abandoning school and leaving their families at the age of middle school to come to the film capital to seek opportunities. They often wait for an opportunity without eating for several days. They are poor and in distress, and they are willing to do anything... washing dishes, taking care of children, working as waiters in restaurants... etc.... hoping that one day they will enter the film industry. They are not afraid of disappointment. They think that if they persevere, one day there will be a miracle that falls on their heads. But in the end, the god of opportunity does not often descend, and the result obtained by most young men and women is heartbreak, disillusionment, hunger, and wandering. But they continue to come and continue to hope. "How many of these school-age young men and women have the hope of succeeding in the film industry? Is it wise for them to abandon their studies and come to seek the source of gold? Should they graduate from local schools in their hometowns first? If you ask the graduates of Hollywood High School this question, they will tell you that you should continue your studies. You don't have to wait in front of the film companies every day. You should put some effort into your books! Because they are in a close position, they understand everything in the film city more clearly. They will advise you not to leave your studies and family and come to this place where there are too many people and no place to set foot!</p>
<p>Strangely enough, many graduates of this Hollywood High School have entered the film industry and succeeded. One graduate said: "When I was studying there, Faye, Marceline Day, and Clayton Chaney were in the same history class as me; William Keenan was in the same English class as me; Marilyn Burns and Irene Murray were members of our literary society; Marilyn Marsh left school to film with John Barrymore; among the classmates, those who are now famous in the film industry also include Bodil Rosing, Barbara Kent, Ben Alexander, Alice White, etc., seven or eight people. But among them, with two exceptions, none of them thought about entering the film industry when they were in school. Not only do the students not pay attention to film affairs, but also the school authorities are most unhappy to hear people say: 'That school is a training center for stars.' There is an English teacher named William Dooper. Of the ten famous film figures who graduated from there, nine came from under his tutelage. But he said: 'We try our best to prevent students who are determined to pursue a career in film from enrolling. Our school is one of the most advanced secondary schools in the country. Therefore, we should maintain the reputation and status of our school, and not truly reduce it to a recruitment agency for film companies. If students want to take this place as a place to rest and wait quietly for opportunities in the film industry, rather than truly come here to study, we will not recognize them as our good students and must exclude them!'"</p>
<p>As for the students, they also occasionally work as extras in film companies to earn some pocket money. But this does not violate the school's regulations, and it is common throughout the United States to find small jobs to earn money to maintain personal livelihood. Hollywood cannot be regarded as an exception. However, the students unanimously agree with the school authorities' policy of maintaining the dignity of the school. They say that although many graduates of the school have succeeded in the film industry, this does not affect the school's studies, academic style, etc. Moreover, in fact, the path for male and female students graduating from Hollywood High School to enter the film industry is not more convenient than those from other schools.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e302">Review of "Love's Magic" <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Sisters Under The Skin</p>
<p>丨Cathay丨</p>
<p>Indeed, Columbia Pictures has recently been "making great strides." From "Madame" and "It Happened One Night" to this "Love's Magic," the producers have indeed abandoned those Western film plans and are producing so-called big films on a large scale. This has somewhat changed the audience's previous bad impressions of the company. However, this does not mean that "Madame" or "It Happened One Night" are completely successful works, but rather that the bad habit of shoddy production is now almost completely eliminated.</p>
<p>As far as this "Love's Magic" is concerned, we feel that the director's technique is the first thing worth noting. I may not be very familiar with the name David Burton, but in terms of his achievements in this film, there are many things that deserve our praise.</p>
<p>First, the Montage is very compact and concise. There are no trivial scenes in it, and every scene is necessary for the drama. For example, the various pleasures enjoyed by the male and female protagonists in London and Paris, as well as the various scenes of the female protagonist in jewelry stores and hat shops, are all high-speed reproductions. In addition, many unnecessary processes are very cleanly omitted.</p>
<p>Second, what we should pay attention to is the Tempo's speed. This is naturally inextricably linked to the Montage, and can also be said to belong to the Montage. The reason why it should be particularly pointed out is that the high-speed development of the aforementioned scenes, in depicting the need to emphasize the stimulation of noble people in decadent enjoyment, this high-speed fast is indeed the best expression method. And when Ye Si returned to his office disheartened, and when he discovered the inner pain of his lover before, that extremely slow tone, for the help of the protagonist's inner heart, in the extremely quiet air, is really very effective.</p>
<p>Third, the director's meticulous attention to the development of each scene is also worth noting. When the male and female protagonists first meet in the garden, the man kisses her forcefully, and the woman refuses and slaps him in the face. (This is a foreshadowing for later.) When Ye Si learned the true attitude of his lover towards himself, before he came to her house and entered the room, he approached the mirror, looked at his old face, and saw a pot of delicate flowers on the table. Immediately, he felt cold, tightened his clothes, and walked into the room sadly and calmly. . . . . . From these places, we can feel a kind of cold emotion, and this is obtained through delicate scenes.</p>
<p>Fourth, what we can talk about is the vibrancy of the shots. As mentioned earlier, the complex scenes of enjoyment, shopping, and buying clothes, those many low-angle shots are really very commendable. However, his angle of the shots is not lively for no reason. For example, when the male and female protagonists climbed the stairs step by step with the musician, in order to show the youth and old age between them, the camera has always been shooting from above. The two young people walked quickly and effortlessly, while Ye Si was very labored and finally sat on the stairs to rest, panting. Until the female protagonist came back to support him, the camera remained at the same angle. But we don't feel bored because in this way, the contrast between their vigor and twilight is very clear and moving. As for when the musician is playing a sad violin, taking close-ups of each face with the same emotion under different angles, and then Dissolving to the stage and the surrounding audience, are all worth learning from.</p>
<p>Fifth, as for other descriptions of the surrounding air, such as using rain to write about the depression of the mood, using the summer night's moon and wind to write about the male protagonist's leisurely mood, and using the breeze of the window curtains to write about the warmth of the hidden boudoir, from these places, the director quite used symbolic techniques and achieved good results.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, naturally we cannot ignore that most of this is the success of the script. This is not only because the playwright fully paid attention to the use of film art in the creative process, but also because we cannot deny that it has a certain degree of seriousness in the theme. Of course, what is written here is only limited to the scope of love, and it is indeed not easy to write about a 50-year-old person who wants to obtain true love. In the end, it is a terrible disillusionment. From this aspect, the intermediate process is indeed quite realistically written and very attractive. This is also the playwright's ultimate goal. But due to the choice of subject matter, what kind of impression does it give us in terms of the effect of the drama? That Ye Si devoted his life to making money and could not get the opportunity to enjoy himself. Although he had a kind heart, he bought the love of a young girl with a lot of money, but in the end, due to age, he only limited the girl to the pain of love. A lot of money, after all, cannot buy back the lost youth. In the end, he was disheartened and, after being hurt once, returned to his career. This, that wealthy Ye Si, made the audience very sympathetic.</p>
<p>In American films, it is always difficult to leave this aspect of preaching, but because of its weight, it does not make us very disgusted. However, in objectively appreciating a work of art, perhaps we should pay more attention to their expression methods. At least, like many successful old-fashioned literary works, there are many things that are worth our criticism and appreciation.</p>
<p>The heroine Elizabeth Allan writes well, but there is nothing outstanding, and the success of the male lead Frank Morgan in this film is something we should be surprised about. The other two supporting roles – Ye Si's wife and the musician – are both competent.</p>

In terms of actors, Xuan Jinglin plays a crazy old woman, Gao Qianping plays a wandering girl, Sun Min plays a lecherous young man, Zhao Dan plays a lame old man, and Mei Xi plays a revolutionary youth. It can be said that they are all very competent. Because Shen Xiling himself and the Mingxing Company attach great importance to this play, they decided to produce it with dubbing.</p>

<p>— Translated by Yours Truly</p>
<p>After the photographer shouted loudly, the bedroom door of Pan Qi's ship suddenly opened, and a person jumped out. It was a beautiful woman, wearing only a white dress as thin as cicada wings, with her flesh color vaguely visible. The beautiful woman jumped straight out of the room, as if there were tigers eating her inside, rushing to Pan Qi's side, hugging him tightly, burying her head directly in his arms, and shouting loudly, "Daddy!" At this moment, the camera clicked, and the true scene was captured in the lens. Pan Qi frantically shouted, "Slow down!" But the photographer had already been squeezed into the crowd, and his whereabouts were unknown. And Yi Di also retreated to the bedroom like a startled swan, slamming the door shut. At this time, the news reporters believed that this was the best possible news, and immediately surrounded him, asking, "Mr. Pan Qi, do you have anything to announce?"</p>
<p>At this time, Yi Di had already run to the house of Que Li · Tongna. Jidi was arguing with her, telling her to go back, but Yi Di refused, determined not to talk about love anymore, and to be a good woman. She told Jidi to go home alone. Jidi wanted to pull her away, but Yi Di pushed her away like a madwoman. Jidi had no choice but to walk out of Tongna's door alone. As soon as Jidi stepped down the stairs, a person came running towards her and bumped into her. Jidi was startled when she saw it was Tom. Tom asked, "Where is Yi Di?" Jidi said, "Upstairs!" Tom pushed Jidi aside! and also pushed away the doorman of Tongna's house, and ran straight upstairs. Jidi chased desperately from behind. As soon as he went upstairs, he ran to the room where Tongna and Yi Di were standing. Without saying a word, he punched Tongna in the face. Then, without saying a word, he pulled Yi Di to the bathroom, turned on the cold water tap to the maximum, and dunked her head in the cold water. Yi Di struggled fiercely, but Tom was incredibly strong, and she couldn't break free. Tom then said resentfully, "You're drunk. I'm here to save you, even if it means drowning you!" Yi Di managed to catch her breath and shouted, "Tom, it's too late!" Tom's hand loosened when he heard this, and his face turned white. He quickly asked, "Too late? Have you and Tongna already..." Yi Di said, "No. Your father has already fallen for one of my tricks!" She wanted to tell Tom about what had happened in the past. But she saw a person standing outside the door, it was Pan Qi himself, so she stopped talking. Pan Qi said angrily, "You really know how to trick me!" Yi Di teased him, "Okay, Mr. Ambassador, think twice before you try to trap a woman again!" Pan Qi pulled Yi Di and Tom out together, where Tongna was still touching his cheek, which was throbbing with pain. Pan Qi shouted at Yi Di, "Be careful, I'm not finished with you yet!" Yi Di also retorted without showing any weakness, "You be careful too! If you do anything to me again, I'll tell the news reporters!" Pan Qi said, "Even if you tell the news reporters, you have to say it my way!" Yi Di said, "What's your way of saying it?" Pan Qi said, "I've already told them that you're a good person. This matter was entirely fabricated by my political enemies. As for why you're in my house? It's because you're my daughter-in-law..." He turned to look at Tom and said, "Your wife!" He then grabbed Yi Di's hand again and said, "It's getting late. The shipowner can't wait for us to board all night!" Tom wrung his hands and said, "If only we could get a marriage license!" Pan Qi said, "You don't need to worry about anything, I've taken care of everything for you." He opened the door to the living room, and a pastor and others were standing outside. Pan Qi also pulled the shocked Jidi and the still-aching Tongna to be witnesses. Yi Di even smiled at Pan Qi and said, "Don't tell me this is another one of your tricks, trying to escape a difficult situation?" Pan Qi laughed, "Don't worry. I've struggled my whole life to get here. Now that I have you, the family will have descendants!" (The End)</p>
