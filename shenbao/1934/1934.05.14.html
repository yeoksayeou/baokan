<p>時評</p>
<h3>英日商戰展開</h3>
<p>— 貞</p>
<p>英國商務總長任錫曼近在下議院聲明。謂已商請各自治領及殖民地政府。採用輸入限額辦法。以一九二九年至一九三一年平均輸八量爲根據。限制棉製品與人造絲製品之輸入英國及其屬領各地同時又通告取消英日間之西非商約。按英國限制輸入。目的固在對付日本。惟日貨在英帝國之傾銷。不止紡織品一項。故又有擴大限制範圍之擬議。</p>
<p>英國實行限額輸入。首先感受影響者。厥爲日本。是以東京外務省獲悉英方聲明後。卽發表非正式談話。一則辨白日本不負英日商業會議决裂之責任。再則認爲任錫曼之聲明。有損英日多年之邦交。三則引證法政府實施限額輸入英國提出抗議之先例。深覺英國此舉有違反最惠國條欵之嫌。四則喚起英國冷靜與縝密之考慮。着其注意現時日本產業之健金。絕非十年前所可比擬。結論則表示英國如有誠意。尙不難作最後轉圜吾人細觀雙方聲明。在英國固未嘗嚴閉談判之門。在日本尤願與英恊商。故對立形勢。雖甚緊張。似有緩和之恣態。</p>
<p>顧英日兩國之根本對立。醖釀已久。惡化已深。卽令暫時好轉。終難澈底融洽。蓋日本產業逐步發達。其棉製品匪特足以掩蓋我國揚子江流域之英貨市塲。且進而侵入南洋羣島印度錫蘭。甚至埃及南非。遂使英帝國之勢力範圍爲之擊破。蘭開夏與曼却斯德之紡織界深感不安。根深蒂固之英吉利紡織業根本動搖。然英國工商業固曾經歷長時期之爭鬭訓練。在此緊急關頭。豈肯輕易退讓。矧日本產業之發達。復足爲專事侵略之軍國主義張目。所謂東亞門羅主義之魔手。難免不伸展於香港以西。控制馬來半島而震撼印度。今日本席捲東亞之野心。已次第暴露。其海軍戰鬥力之强大。亦爲英人所默認。英人爲保持其領土與市塲之安全計。自不能不隨經濟制裁之後。而兼及軍備之擴充。如九龍砲壘之建築。新加坡軍港之急進。與夫澳洲紐西蘭艦隊之整頓。皆其具體之表演也。而况英國外交手腕。素極老練。聯美抗日。尤爲其遠東政策之骨幹。英日邦交在短時期内。雖不至中絕。而今後必將視美國態度而變化。則可斷言。今日遠東大局。頗類歐戰之前夜以日本與德國相並論。亦頗神似。我其爲土耳其乎。抑爲比利時乎。</p>

<h3>監察院　對憲草之貢獻（續）　關於監察權部分</h3>
<p>（六）監察院院長副院長·及監察委員、均應綵取任命制、監察委員之任期、應定爲終身或十年以上、（説明）監察院院長副院長、由於監察委員互選、此種規定、不獨爲總理遺敎所無、且與總理遺敎相背、孫文學説第六章中、明明主張監察院院長由總統得立法院之同意而委任之、良以監察院與立法院、性質根本不同、立法院爲合議機關監察院則由監察委員單獨行使職權、絕非合議關體、必欲仿效合議機關成例、令其自選院長、殊屬擬於不倫、蓋監察委員之生產、規定由國民大會選舉、尤其與監察委員之獨立精神相違背、因監察委員爲執法之官以單獨行使職機爲主、行動旣須獨立、地位尤貴超然、其彈劾權之行使、自當以法律爲根據、不當以政治爲背景、各國法律、皆務使司法官獨立在政治關係之外、卽因司法官之地位、以超然獨立爲主、必令其與政治運用絕緣、乃能執法如山、屹然不動、監察委員爲全國公務人員之司法官、如使其依附政治勢力而來、便不能不使其隨同政治勢力而去、將來結果、不使監察委員完全變成政客、卽使政客變成監察委員、監察委員一陷入政治漩渦、勢必利用彈劾權力、作爲政爭工具將何以維持監察權之獨立、及法律之尊嚴、美國各邦之司法官吏、向由人民選舉、試騐結果、百弊叢生、不得不决然廢棄、今我國草創新制、乃不惜拾他人唾棄之舊法而用之、政治前途、何堪設想、至於監察委員任期之久暫、與其行使職權、頗有密切關係、鞏固其地位、卽所以保障其自由、若頻頻改選、弱者必旅進旅退、噤若寒蟬、黠者又將利用職權、以逢合選舉者之心理、正義公平、早已置之度外、故爲保障監察委員之自由與獨立計、自應延長其任期、鞏固其地位、除因受刑事處分或懲戒罷免外、其任期應定爲終身、或至少亦須在十年以上、</p>
<p>（七）彈劾審計兩權、應由中央統一行使、彈劾權與罷免權、應加區别、（説明）彈劾審計之權、應由中央統一行使、在第二項内、已經詳言、茲简單申述之、所貴於有地方自治者、爲發展人民之自治能力、與對於公務之興趣、故對於决定政策（立法）及執行政策（行政）之權、各國多賦予地方、至政策决定之後而見諸實行之時、使其勿徇私勿濫用公欵、以最經濟之方法、收最大之效果、乃爲負統籌全局之中央所不應放棄之責任、故世界各國對於司法、不認爲地方事項、而審計及監督屬吏違法失職、亦由中央之行政機關行使、此次憲草初稿、對於司法之權、旣未讓給地方、則彈劾及審計之權、亦理應由中央統一行使、而不應護地方立法機關之縣市議會代庖、憲草初稿中於彈劾與罷免之界限、諸多含糊、如第九十六條第二項、「立法院對於行政院質詢之答復、認爲不滿意時、得經出席委員三分二以上之决議、提出不信任案」、至監察院如何提出彈劾案、則並無明文規定、第一四七條規定「縣長有違法失職時、經縣議員四分三之議决、得提出彈劾案、請縣民罷免之」、在立法院欲請國民委員會罷免行政院時之提案、名曰不信任案、在縣議會欲請縣民罷免縣長時之提案、名曰彈劾案、兩案之性質上、根本何作區别、殊覺令人茫然、在歐洲採行内閣制之國家、國會之不信任案、一經通過、除由大總統解散國會外、内閣當然解體、憲章上之不信任案、竟究係何作用倘經委員會否决而立法院又不當然解散、則立法與行政當局、此後將不能互助合作、故同人之意、認爲彈劾權與罷免權之界限、應爲分淸、彈劾對象、應祗限於違法失職、而不能過問政策之當否及其施政之是否滿意、罷免權應包括政策之良否、施政之效律、以及違法失職、彈劾權應單獨行使、罷免權必須賦有政權者過半數之通過方得成立、故縣市民施行罷免權之範圍、祇應以純粹之縣立法縣行政爲限、各縣市公務員代中央執行法令、而爲人民不滿時、則祇應向主管之上級機關申訴或請願、而不得直接罷免以免除中央與地方之糾紛、</p>

<h3>江浙　春繭行將上市</h3>
<p>中央社云、本年春繭、轉瞬卽將上市、惟繭價因存絲堆積、不能樂觀、據絲業界中人語記者、本春繭價、恐每據祇二百元之數而已、又經委會蠶絲改良會、爲救濟蠶絲起見、將組江浙聯合絲廠、茲將所得各情、分誌如次、</p>
<h3>春蠶情形不一</h3>
<p>據記者探悉、本春江浙蠶絲、因天時寒暖不定、土種早蠶成績不佳惟江浙兩省、所發給無錫鎭江蘇州金壇杭縣富陽蕭山等各模範區改良種百餘萬張、因發育較遲、又得指導員用科學方法、普及指示、故成績極佳、日來三眠時期、猶見强健、預料收成時期、必能樂觀、</p>
<h3>繭價難見上漲</h3>
<p>本春繭市、將於二十日左右上市、江浙兩省、業已實行收繭統制、繭商均甚願意合作、惟繭價因絲廠頗多停工、故豫料必不見過昻、據繭業中人言、今春繭價、恐逃不過二百元關、卽每斤價格祇二角左右云、</p>
<h3>將設聯合絲廠</h3>
<p>蠶絲改良會目睹絲業危狀、若不設法救濟、則前途將不堪設想、故經各委數度商洽後、决設江浙聯合絲廠、集江浙兩省所有繅絲廠、統一指歸、惟此</p>
<h3>交部市府等四機關商定疏浚吳淞江　全部經費預算二百餘萬　俟經委會籌撥後卽動工　工程完竣後商連農事均蒙其利</h3>
<p>吳淞江橫貫滬蘇、扼内地水道支流之樞紐、祗以歷年不事疏濬、河道淤塞、前雖具有疏浚計劃、緣爲經費支絀、致未告成、内政交通兩部以該江爲水路要衝、對商業運輸、農田灌漑、關係甚鉅、特會同江蘇省府滬市府等、於前日在京舉行會議、决定疏浚計劃、及全部工程經費、預定六年内完成、其經費俟商請全國經委會籌廢後、卽可開工、茲經大公社記者探誌各情如下、</p>
<h3>會商决定</h3>
<p>内政部交通部爲吳淞江歷久淤塞、農商均　不便、特計劃設法疏浚、俾利交通、惟此江與地方政府有密切關係、特於前日（卽本月十二日）咨請江蘇省政府、上海市政府等機關、在京會商疏浚計劃及確定經費、當經討論結果、决定疏濬吳淞江、經費定二百十四萬元、向全國經濟委員會籌借、將來由田賦附加及各水利機關攤派償還、預定六年完成、該項經費待經常會通過照撥後、卽行開工云、</p>
<h3>疏浚計劃</h3>
<p>疏浚吳淞江之計劃、前經江南水利局·與上海濬浦局、會同擬訂、頗爲精翔、自江南水利局改組爲太湖水利會直接隸屬交通部後、對於前項計劃、仍屬適用、未稍變更、至其疏浚計劃、全部工程内容、爲（一）徐公港江至梵皇渡一段、最爲淤淺狹窄、此段長約五十九公里、（二）野鷄墩一段、河道灣曲、最易淤塞、擬修灣裁直、並關掘新河、（三）瓜涇江至江河村一段、須挖深河底、（四）梵皇渡至外白渡橋一段、爲船隻必經要道、亟宜疏浚、以上全部工程、所開土方數目、計實土爲五十五萬方、野鷄墩修灣裁直、另開新河之土方、計十七萬方、將來開浚完成後、沿江農田灌漑、商業航運、均有莫大裨益也、</p>
<h3>經費預算</h3>
<p>關於疏浚吳淞江之計劃工程、殊爲浩大、而其需用經費預算、支配如下、收用土地價六六·七五○元、土方共價一·五一五·四六○元、行政費一二○·○○○元、挖泥機擬購三艘、共價三一○·○○○元、拖船二艘共價五○·○○○元、設備費一○○○○元、預備費六七·七九○元、合計爲二百十四萬元、</p>
<p>事頗難着手、據調查現在江蘇省境四百餘家繅絲廠、祇十餘家開工、若謀救濟、須巨大資額、聞此事現正着手籌劃、最遲明春卽可全部統一於江浙聯合絲廠之下云、</p>

<h3>讀書問答</h3>
<p>自然科學上面的探究。</p>
<p>本欄對於自然科學的討論這還是第一次，原因是：（一）這類討論恐怕不能引起大家的興趣；（二）關於這類問題，我們每次都是去請專家答覆的，有時因爲答覆過於簡略，也不便在此公佈。這一次，却是例外了。覆這封信的人還是一位十九歲的靑年，他的自然科學的智識完全出於自學的。這一點値得我們特另注意。這位靑年學者就是陶知行先生的令哲陶宏先生。我們除向陶宏先生致謝外，特别介紹於本文的讀者前，藉以鼓勵自學自然科學的諸君。編者讀書指導：</p>
<p>近日在讀書問答上見到「釋疑」一篇，你們是確實「不怕煩」的。自然科學，想亦同樣的樂於爲我們解釋的吧？</p>
<p>我目前的讀書環境不算壞，在一家炭酸鈣廠裏做「種不費時間的工作。」因爲我對於定性分析的能力還是不够，故除了化學外，未嘗注意到别的。不過我最大的願望是到礦地去作事，所以，在此時就擬讀起礦物學等來。不知道礦物學中要以那一部分爲重要？又在那一方面最能獲得到書本上的證實？書上講礦物學的時候，祇是表格樣的説下去，怎去記牢？現在我祇弄了各種礦石，把牠定性，不知别人怎樣的去下功夫的？另外還有關於實際上的問題，可是已經越了你們的範圍，姑且寫幾個出來，希望你們能答覆我。</p>
<p>落葉松菌梭Ａｃｉｄ　Ａｇａｒｉａｉｎｉｃｕｍ是什麽東西？</p>
<p>某一種石灰石（祇是雜着存在的）燒出來的灰，顯墨綠的顏色，化了水竟和調了染劑一樣，條痕帶黃色，怎樣解釋牠？</p>
<p>太湖中的西山等是石灰岩，吳西多大成岩，大槪交界在何處？怎樣知道？二者間的陽山，有煤苗發見（西山有煤礦有怎樣的關係？</p>
<p>在科學十五卷二期上「法人對我國瓷器原料研究之大槪」後幾節有「龍白　烏金　」等的分柝表是這樣寫着的：</p>
<p>ＦｕｓｉｏｎＨＦｓｏｌｕｂｌｅ　Ｈ２ＳＯ４　ｓｏｌｕｂｌｅＨ２ＳＯ４　ｓｏｌｕｂｌｅＨｃｌｓｏｌｕｂｌｅＳｉｏ２　Ｈ２Ｏ３　Ｆｅ２Ｏ３　Ｔｉｏ２　Ｍｎｏ３　Ｍ９０　Ｋ２ｏ　Ｖａ２ｏ</p>
<p>從此我們怎樣去知道原礦物的組成就是原礦物梭硅鹽在Ｈｃｌ　Ｈ２ＳＯ４裏的溶解情形？上表Ｓｉｏ２的溶解度倒底怎樣算法？再假使這裏面含有ＣａＦ２那怎樣？正硅酸鹽（Ｈ４　Ｓｉｏ４）異硅鹽（Ｈ２Ｓｉｏ３）二硅酸鹽（Ｈ６Ｓｉ２０７）三硅酸鹽（Ｈ４　Ｓｉ２０８）之溶解情形（對於Ｈｃｌ，Ｈ２ＳＯ４）有規則嗎？孰易孰不易？</p>
<p>—新業化工廠林雪冷—</p>
<p>我們很佩服您的偉大的願望丨丨到礦地去實際工作，而預祈你成功。中國内地的豐富儲藏的礦產，是在在需要人去開採的；可是這固然因爲國家經濟狀况的關係，没有實現多少，而人材的缺乏却也是個很重要的原因。我對於您現在攻礦物學，有下面九點小小的意見：（一）科學上面的探究絕非「讀」所能奏效的，尤其是這種重在實用方面的礦物學。你要探究礦物學，你、定要設身處地地和種種鑛物接觸，你要鑽到鑛物裏去研究追尋，而不能單在書本上去用功夫，（二）在没有專攻鑛物學之先，需要有普通化學，普通地質學，等等和鑛物學有關係的知識。這些學問也都要實地去體騐的。你現在研究化學，同時也還得去做做地質學的功夫，（三）你曾問到在那一方面最能獲到書本上的證實。我覺得祇有一個最好的，也就是唯一的證明書本上所説的，那便是實地去試騐。科學上一切的理論全根基在實騐上的，我們要證明這理論也祇有從實騐做去。（四）書本上所講到的礦物，固然是好像表格樣地説下去，並不是呌你好像能牢算學公式似地去死記，而且算學公式也不必死記，而在於活用。最重要的是在將别人記載在書本上的經騐和觀察，應用到實際上去；拿牠當我們對付這件事情的顧問看，牠是一個參考。當我們自己還没有證實牠所説的時候，我們爲什麽一定要記牢呢？等到你所觀察的事情多了的時候，你的經騐豐富的時候，自然而然地就記牢了。在你現在採集了各種的礦石，把牠們定性分柝，這是一個認識礦物的很好的辦法。但是礦物的定性分柝祇是礦物學裏的一部，希望你能按着書本上的步驟一步一步地「實地」做去。</p>
<p>對你所問的問題：（一）落葉松菌酸（ＡｃｃｉｄＡｇａｒｉｃｉｎｉｃｕｍ），我查了好幾部外國專門化學書都没有找着，不知是否英名錯了，抑或太專門了。（二）這種石灰石，牠的條痕旣是黃色，那麽裏面或含有硫磺或菱鐵鑛（Ｓｉｄｅｒｉｔｅ）卽炭酸亞鐵ＦｅＣｏ３的原鑛。這個你爲什麽不運用你所學的分析化學去定性分析一下呢？當你確定了這種石灰石中所含有的幾分時，那麽我們才能去推測爲什麽牠的灰化了水後會變成染色劑了；否則那不是瞎猜嗎？因爲像你所説的那種石灰石可以和任何其他雜質相混，所以要知道牠的變化的原因，必得先知道牠是由那幾種東西混合成的。（三）太湖中的西山等是石灰岩，吳西多火成岩，這兩種岩石交界地方在何處須實地調查始知。對於這種小地方的地層是不能槪括爲整個地層狀况的，所以地質學上調查各地之地層報告，通常都是以河流流域和好多有關係的省區爲單位的。對於在這二者間的地方有煤苗發見（而西山有煤礦，其間的關係也須實地調查才知。不過我這樣精想：當太古石炭紀時，那些地方長有很高大的羊齒類植物，後來地殼變動，海洋將那些地方淹没，等海水復退去時，海水中的泥沙堆積成爲水成岩丨丨石灰岩是水成岩的一種丨丨，於是西山那兒石灰岩和煤鑛丨丨羊齒植物變作煤。但在附近的吳西所以多火成岩我猜是這樣：水成岩形成後，但其中有些大小不一的空隙，而這些空隙都連着地殼内的岩漿，於是岩漿流入這些空隙，凝成火成岩，在地質學上所謂侵入岩層（ＩｎｔｒｕｓｉｖｅＳｈｅｅｌ）的就是這樣。於是吳西便多火成岩。不知閣下以爲如何。吳西不知是否蘇州以西，抑或無錫之誤？</p>
<p>（四）對於瓷器原料的分析這得去考究專家，我們不淸楚。但對於「原礦物的組成就是原礦物内硅酸鹽在硫酸在鹽酸中的溶解情形」一點，我可解釋如下：差不多各種物質在同一温度狀况之下，對於同溶劑的溶解度是不同的。我們旣知道某種硅酸鹽（如硅酸硅，或錳酸鉀，等）的對於某種溶劑的溶解度，那麽這是那一種硅酸鹽自然也可知道了。於是這種礦物中含有那種硅酸鹽自然也知道了。（五）你所列出的表太不淸楚，不好解答。對於硅氧　在什麽溶劑的溶解度你也没説淸。普通　種物質對於某種溶劑的溶解度算求，都是將牠的飽和溶液的一定量，蒸發去，測算殘留溶質之重量而定的。假設溶液中含有氟化鈣，得運用牠們不同的性質或溶解度除去，後再定之。（完）</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>慶善的緯帽上還有一件很講究的裝飾品，就是那揷孔雀翎的翎管，也是玉製的，它的式樣却和現在最流行的香烟咬嘴差不多。</p>
<p>我二哥的服色也和慶善的服色大致相同，雖然他是一位公爵的兒子，而且還是承襲　爵位的人。爵位原來祇是一個虚名，有什麽實在的用處呢？但看慶善他雖説也是一位一品大臣，却並無什麽爵位，然而宫裏頭和朝廷上的一切政務，他倒有權包攬，只要李蓮英不和他搗蛋，他儘可暢行無忌。所以憑實權而論，隨便在什麽地方，他總比我二哥來得大。其實就是光緒皇帝的弟兄，也没有慶善那樣大的權勢咧！我敢斷然的説，我並不知道一個虚而不實的爵位，能有多少價値？祇不過在我們的祖上最初得封爵位的時候，因爲這個人確曾有許多特殊的功勛和勞績，才能博到這個恩賜的緣故，在他開始受爵的短短的一刹那間，便眞有一班人向他艷羨着，恭維着：待到他本人一死，他的子孫承襲了他的爵位，旁人就不再因他是功臣的後裔而特加靑眼了。</p>
<p>我二哥的箭衣，馬褂，緯帽，可説跟慶善的是完全相同的，所不同的祇是腰帶上的一副扣子。他那副扣子是用二十四開的外國金所製造的，一起接連着三個金環，用一段極精緻的細鏈繫着。這三個金環的分量都是很重的，但是打磨得十分光滑，上面還有許多花紋鑿着；我二哥歡喜用卍字，所以他的環上都是鑿着無數的卍字。這副扣子的大部份雖然都是金的，但也有好幾方上好的翠玉鑲着，因此更比慶喜的來得看。（三二）</p>
<h3>北平護國寺</h3>
<p>— 病鴛</p>
<p>北平西便門外，去郊二十餘里，有山曰八寳，山後有護國寺，約共佔地一頃。最奇特者，寺中供奉，非菩薩，亦非眞人；’廟内住持，無和尙，亦無道人，蓋受香火與奉祭祀者，上下均屬閹宦也。相傳明代燕王北征，有御前一近侍太監，名剛鐵者，因衛駕戰死於八寳山附近。遂爲建廟享祀，以紀念其殊勳。故廟之最後一殿，尙係明代建築物。而廟内墓碑，巍然獨立，雖經風雨剝蝕，莊嚴之象猶存。大殿上塑像絕精，你出自明代塑工之手。惟游人與羅拜者，瞻仰遺容，一望卽知神爲太監，因其裝束至顯用耳。像前陳丈餘長鐵义及弓矢等，據廟中之活太監言，「此卽當日剛老爺所親用之武器也。」其説究竟信否，亦無從考證矣。左右壁畫，描金繪素，筆法極工細，皆爲剛爺之忠勇戰績寫眞也。惟畫工對於祭法寳收妖怪等等封神榜西遊記之興趣太濃，致减却眞蹟之價値，殊稱憾事。樑上懸橫匾，曰「花竹淸和」，下署「潘祖蔭」名，按潘吳人，經學大師而淸季名臣者也。居然遺其手澤於此無稽之境，可見當時宦官之專橫盜弄，一時物望之潘大學士，猶不敢不與其結納，而以文字媚之。正殿堦墀下，樹短碣，刻重建護國寺全文，而以慈禧倖嬖之李蓮英作領銜人焉。最近之住持郭玉文，原係淸故宫圓明園中掌管花草之太監。現該廟共有監衆三十餘人，另職工約六十，寺產有田六八頃，儘够澆裹。惟年事最輕者，亦近半百，説者嘗謂：再三十年後，老監相繼亡，新監不再生，而此特殊之護國寺，將不知如何移轉其管轄乎？此輩公公，亦嘗興念及此，輙對客欷歔！而於舊時上苑，反無故主之思也。</p>
<h3>蘇州居住談</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>誰都承認蘇州是個水土淸嘉的住宅區，因爲地多港，有魚蝦螃蟹菱芡荷藕之利，時鮮食品，大快朶頤，並且生活程度較低，一切容易應付，住的屋子，大都是祖傳的，動輒五六進，有轎廳，大廳，女廳，花廳，種種的排塲，後面往往還有個園圃，栽蔬種竹，植木養鷄，異常舒展，主人什九有田，多的二三千畝，少的也有幾百畝，一到初冬十月，設棧收租，往時每畝除去糧税，可凈收八九元，那麽有二三千畝的，便有萬元以上的進欵，就是幾百畝的，也有數千元可得，一年開銷，那裏用的完，有餘的欵，還可以存到莊上去放拆息，優游歲月，談不到生計，慮不到衣食。這種快活神仙，眞不知幾生修到呢。</p>
<p>可是近來情形大變，無論是荒年熟年，收入要大大的打個折扣，那些田主人家，便感受到影響，漸有入不敷出的恐慌。但是蘇州人虚榮心很重，排塲如此，又不能驟然緊縮，給人家笑話。那麽旣不能節流，祇得從開源方面着手，不得已到上海來謀得一事半職。索性携了家眷，放棄了水土淸嘉的故鄉，到麝囂甚上的上海來做個寓公，同時别地方的一般政客武人，名流學士，都紛紛的在蘇購地築屋，以爲菟裘之計。這種趨勢，恐怕隔不到幾年，蘇州成爲一個四方人士公共享福的所在，眞正的蘇州人，倒在淘汰之列哩。</p>
<h3>國　何處</h3>
<h3>臨刑一刹那</h3>
<p>— 王定九</p>
<p>上海是罪惡的都市，盜竊淫邪，各報上社會新聞版，天天有三山五嶽好漢們來串演。捕房，法院，監獄，鬧着人滿。判處死刑者衆多，怕酆都城也將鬼口（人稱人口，鬼自可名鬼口。）</p>
<p>過剩了！</p>
<p>黑熊似的一輛囚車，某一個早蝴又發現滬西道上；駛進漕河涇監所的刑塲。狼虎般的司法警察，抓小鷄樣把每一個待决的死囚，推至尊嚴檢察官案前。囚犯猛抬頭已認死神當面，意識糢糊。懦弱的垂頭喪氣，强項的始終不屈。</p>
<p>「幹嗎？咱老子二十年後再來會你」</p>
<p>順水人情的法官，牧師，慈善家。肅穆的辭色中，都含一些惋惜，告誡，垂詢身後，和代爲懺悔。並餽蒙汗藥；使他洗刷過去的罪孼，麻醉最後一刹那的痛苦。</p>
<p>硃筆向斬條上撲的一下，他的姓名上便印了一顆血花；做他五分鐘後大流血的前奏。</p>
<p>向南惠山要貨般矮了半截，排列蹲下以後。白布蒙住了他的兩眼，手銃已描凖了他的頭顱。八字鬚尊口碰出一個「行」字臨刑的司法警便　動槍機「乒！乓！」數下，「硃簽仁碧血一色，鐵鐐共槍聲齊鳴。」一世之雄已倒葱似的陳屍曠塲，嗚呼哀哉了！</p>
<p>牆外家屬們聽到「乒乓，」子彈尤若鑽入自己的心窩。父母哭了，妻子啼了，兒女呼號了。唉！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十八回　巧合共觀塲痴情拾帕　　殷勤兩問疾誤會投書江氏道：街坊鄰居，這也是應當的。積之連連點着頭道：老太太請坐，老太太請坐。江氏退後兩步，離着床很遠了，這旣無法伸手去偸那手絹，自己又不便直接向積之説，自己是來要手絹的，問問積之燒不燒，吃了些什麽没有？心裏起了好幾個念頭，總不能够説明。約坐了十幾分鐘，自己感到無聊，也就走了。但是他人雖走了，心裏對於這件事，却絕對不能放下，一人悶在心裏，在家中走進走出，都打着主意，要怎樣的把那條手絹取回來。到了下午，他究竟想得一個主意了，便在瓦罐子裏，包了十個柿餅，又到甘家來。到了門口，並不見人，只好在院子裏咳嗽了兩聲。却聽到積之在屋子裏呌道：院子裏没人呢，老太太請進來罷。江氏手上托着那十個柿餅，走進書房去，却見積之手撑了椅子靠背，慢慢的站了起來。江氏道：喲！你就起來啦，怎麽不多歇着歇着。積之笑道：這感冒病，來是風，去是雨，不會有好久時候的。江氏笑道：上午來的怱忙，我也忘了。我們親戚在山裏住，去冬送了我一些柿餅，我挑了幾個乾凈的，轉送給二爺罷。説着，將柿餅放在桌上。積之連説多謝多謝，自己呌了兩聲王媽，是讓他倒茶，因爲没有人答應，自己走出書房去了。江氏認爲這是一個機會，也不攔阻，便坐在床上，眼觀着積之的後影，見他轉過灣去了，立刻掀起這床上的被褥，找那手絹。彷彿看到墊褥下面，有塊白的東西，還不曾分辨得淸楚呢，却聽到窗户外面，一陣脚步響，立刻將被褥放下來，在床沿上坐着。（三八三）</p>

<h3>寳塚遊記</h3>
<p>— 君尙</p>
<p>嘗聞人言，遊日本而未抵寳塚者，日本之遊未竟也，蓋寳塚山水之秀麗，少女歌舞團表演之動人，名聞遠東。余旅是邦已兼旬，每欲前往以飽眼福，苦無須臾間，衷心悵悵。四月二十日，與中華兒敎社參觀團赴大阪，遇吾國駐阪領事館舊雨吳仲康君，乃作伴同往寳塚，以償宿願。</p>
<p>吾人自大阪搭電車，歷四十分鐘卽達目的地，比至，但見層巒疊嶂，城堡環抱如　，兩岸百物闐肆，粉櫻夾道，聽絲竹管弦，裊裊於巷裏樓頭，撫景攄懷，不勝神往。步行四分點，新温泉塲在望，此卽寳塚遊藝之中心地，舉凡劇塲，浴池，食堂，動物園，植物園，樂園，兒童遊園等無不羅列於是，門票二角，除觀劇外，均可自由游覽。</p>
<p>劇塲分大，中，小三種，小者闊三十英尺，容五百人，在三樓作放映電影，演技，集會等用，中劇塲容一千五百人大多演新劇及特殊之表演，大劇塲在底層，卽少女歌舞團演劇之所，廣九十英尺，可容四千人，日人號稱爲東洋第一民衆娛樂塲，門票不分高下，一律三角，大都前數日定購，當日往觀者輒抱向隅，余賴君之助，事前定座，始得從容入席，塲内秩序，不過爾爾。觀衆婦女，携孩抱嬰，彷彿吾國，是日共三劇，一係春之舞，一曰紅梅殿，一爲西洋劇Ｔｏｒａｎｔｏｔｔ，參合中，西，日各國之形式與内容，而於不知不覺中呈顯其比較短長，佈景之應用電力，藝員之衆多，値得觀賞，全體少女，個個健康，而欲求雲鬢霧髻靑娥皓齒之粲者，殊不多觀。演來藝術，尙可過去，若輩皆寳塚少女歌劇學校研究科學生，三百八十人中分設三組，輪流表演，以資練習。此種學校，俟有機會，當再爲文論之。</p>
<p>夷考寳塚，原屬窮聊，位在大阪與神户間明治四十三年（一九一一年）阪神急行電鐵公司始於是間闢草萊，除荆棘，開設浴池，翌年建少女歌劇塲，大正十二年（一九二三年）遭祝融肆虐盡燬，該公司，復經之營之，不日成之，迄今窮鄉已盡爲摩登化矣。噫，同是日月，同是山川，而人之所得乃如是也。</p>

<h3>爲宋國賓先生理想中的中國醫團進一解</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>上期本刋發表宋國賓先生一段文字，呌作「理想中的中國醫團」，大意是説我國新醫，到如今還分着派别。而無形中兩大學會和一個職業團體，分别爲各派人物所支配着，於是各會的方針不一致，各會的意見不相同；非將各會打成一片，聯成一個大團結，不能於新醫前途，有所發展云云。</p>
<p>我承認宋先生所説的話，一部份完全是事實，並且醫界的必須大團結，更有充份的理由。但是這只是醫家和醫家商量的事，却不是醫家要和社會商量的事情。然而宋先生旣把此文在申報發表了之後，我不得不爲宋先生文再進一解，以便社會對於醫界有更淸楚的認識，因爲將來醫界的團結，也許要仰仗的輔助。</p>
<p>所謂派别問題，在我看來，並不是我醫界單方面，自己彰明較著的稱呼的，乃是一半由社會給予我們的。我想宋先生文中屢稱英美德日等派，恐拍宋先生也不過循着社會上習慣而下筆，未必是將派别名稱確定承認吧。</p>
<p>考這種習慣上名稱的來源，只不過二條路：一是學新醫的人，留學的有國别在本國的，有應用外國文字的關係；二是把學術與貨物視爲一體，乃是國人的大毛病。</p>
<p>中國維新以後，凡百事物，仰給於舶來的都稱洋貨，不幸的醫學，也被社會看作洋貨，當然與布疋一樣，分出俄國花標，陰丹士林色布，隨着時代，任從顧客的選購了。醫家旣然以開業售技爲惟一生活方法，自必造成這個趨勢。難怪當年一班醫家爲適應社會心理，而標起德醫法醫美醫來了。從那時候有了這種習慣，遂孕育着一種派别的觀念。而事實上英美留學生，亦未嘗締結過什麽密約，用德日文的醫家，更未簽訂什麽恊定。</p>
<p>至於各個學會和職業團體的成立，遠在這種習慣已成之後，所以决不是各派人物去支配一個團體，實在是團體由各派之努力而組成，那是偶然的形成，不是有意的佔據；而况辦團體事業，不免犧牲許多精神物質的。</p>
<p>從已往的事蹟上看來，我敢證明新醫團體的大政方針，莫不相同，至多不過習慣上的舉動，和局部的辦法，或則一二人的宗旨，有些參差罷了。並不是意見紛歧，黨同伐異，所以團結本不是難事。</p>
<p>然而提綱挈領一句話，須要請醫界同志和社會人士牢記的：就是我們應該「從國家觀念上出發，謀中國學術的獨立。」</p>
<p>文化只宜吸收，學術豈可販賣？但是中國的新文化，都是受外力的侵入，不是自動去採取，幾乎同外貨的傾銷一樣。而侵略的程度，也就隨着列强，在世界上的威權爲轉移，如果學術界裏的人，離開了國家觀念，那麽中國的人才，都像了洋貨；而外人在中國所開設的學校，豈不變了，日本人在上海所開的紗廠，和英國人在上海所開的捲烟公司麽？</p>
<p>假使學術界依舊不覺悟，而社會一般人士，依舊將醫學看成貨物一樣時，那麽説一句笑話，宋先生理想中的中國醫團，也不過是中國洋布業同業公會，而不是國貨商塲。試看舊醫們鬧的國醫館，振振有詞，不是根像提倡國貨土布運動麽？所以我理想中的中國醫團，要由學術獨立的基礎上説起，要時代的科學醫來建設，質之宋先生以爲何如？</p>

<p>取二飯匙至三飯匙的燕麥或麥片，加一咵特（Ｉ　ｑｕａｒｔ）的水，蒸過二十分至三十分鐘，（同量的米須蒸過四十分鐘）然後用細篩篩過，加鹽少許，再加水至一咵特爲止。</p>
<p>有時可用麫粉代替麥片，市上所售出名的代乳粉等也可應用，不過要得到醫生的同意，否則，很容易發生意外的。</p>
<p>二·預備牛奶糊的方法：</p>
<p>牛奶一○○·公斤（三·五盎斯）</p>
<p>水一○○·公斤</p>
<p>麥醬一飯匙</p>
<p>奶油一茶匙</p>
<p>糖二茶匙</p>
<p>把上面的原料拌和再燒過十分鐘。</p>
<p>三·預備蔬菜羹的方法。</p>
<p>蔬菜可用靑菜，蘿葡，番茄，花椰菜等。</p>
<p>蒸熟後篩過蔬菜一○○·公斤</p>
<p>奶油二茶匙</p>
<p>麫粉一五·公斤</p>
<p>菜汁一○○公斤</p>
<p>牛奶一○○公斤</p>
<p>鹽少許</p>
<p>嬰兒喜歡吃甜的食料，所以做母親的要使慣於羹湯的小兒，再傾向於吃蔬菜是很難的。但是他們雖然不願意吃較硬的東西，但每天至少要呌他吃一些的。</p>
<p>這些新的食物，單就蔬菜一項，在腸裏的消化是很慢的，做母親的應當注意到嬰兒吃過了靑菜，在大便中排泄出來，仍舊帶着本來的色澤。但這並不是説不要再繼續吃下去，除非嬰兒有了瀉痢等症，才不繼續着吃蔬菜。</p>
<p>第七個月後嬰兒每天可有一餐的蔬菜，及兩餐粥，或牛奶糊，這些就算固體食料的一部份。</p>
<p>在嬰兒出第一個牙齒的當兒，像油煎餅一類的食物就可以給他吃。肉類和雞蛋要過週歲才可以吃。</p>
<p>一個調養得適當的嬰兒發育的情形大槪如下面所説的。</p>
<p>初出世嬰兒的體重普通都是七·一磅，但男孩是較重二百　　　　萊姆、</p>
<p>嬰兒體重的增加，計算如左：</p>
<p>出世一個月後，較才出世時的重量增加一倍。</p>
<p>一年後，三倍初生時的重量。到了第二年的下半年，體重的增加，就不很凖確，但這並不一定是説嬰兒有了病了　　才出世嬰兒的身長，大槪是從二十时至二十一吋，第一年可長出九吋，第二年後，再加高四吋，到了第四年，就要比出世時加高一倍。</p>
<p>嬰兒的腿，起初是緊緊的　着，小手向上伸着，第三個月，頭部已能少些伸直，不久之後，就能完全抬直了。過了第五個月，已經開始的學坐了，到了第六七個月，就匍匐地爬着漸漸的能够站立。過了週歲，就開始學習行走，自然，他的步伐是不穩定而可驚的，患軟骨症的嬰孩，切勿使其行走過早，因爲骨頭軟弱的緣故，往往發生彎腿屈膝的怪態。（未完）</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（二十八）丹毒</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做丹毒？</p>
<p>（答）丹毒是由於皮膚或粘膜輕微創傷後，化膿性鏈狀球菌侵入而起的創傷傳染病。俗名呌「流火」；西文名Ｅｒｙｓｉｐｅｌａｓ（問）丹毒是怎樣傳播的？</p>
<p>（答）是直接從病人傳播到健康人或間接由器具空氣等傳播的。但病人必定先有感染丹毒的素因存在體内的。</p>
<p>（問）患了丹毒之後，可以得到免疫性嗎？</p>
<p>（答）患了丹毒之後，病人並不能得到免疫性；反有增加素因的傾向。就是往往成爲常習性丹毒。</p>
<p>（問）傳染丹毒之後經過幾天發病？</p>
<p>（答）經過一天到三天的潛伏期纔發病。</p>
<p>（問）發病時全身有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）全身突然以惡寒戰慄發熱開始；數小時到一二天後，起皮膚的病變。</p>
<p>（問）丹毒最容易侵襲的是身體的那一部份？</p>
<p>（答）是面部（因鼻頭潰爛，剃鬚刀傷等）和頭部（搔傷）。</p>
<p>（問）發病的局部現什麽症狀？</p>
<p>（答）該部皮膚發赤腫脹，有光降，灼熱，疼痛，癢感和緊張感。這樣炎症的程度，有急激向下的趨勢。可是皮下組織緊密的部分，却不被擴延，像人中，腹股溝，脛骨緣等處都不致波及。發丹毒局部的附近淋巴腺腫脹疼痛。這樣發病後二天到三天，達極度；其後依次褪色。</p>
<p>（問）還有他種症狀嗎？</p>
<p>（答）有的，像頑固的頭痛，不安，興奮，囈語，嗜眠等腦症狀；又有發食思不振，惡心，嘔吐，泄瀉等，脾臟中等度肥大。</p>
<p>（問）發丹毒的時候，有什麽合併症？</p>
<p>（答）合併症有化膿性腦膜炎，化膿性中耳炎，急性出血性腎炎，間有發敗血症，心臟内膜炎，心包炎，支氣管炎或皮膚膿痬等。甚至誘起皮膚壞疽。此外還有因爲屢次發丹毒而起皮膚的象皮病的。（問）怎樣可以診斷丹毒病呢？</p>
<p>（答）只從全身發熱，皮膚的限局發赤，腫脹，疼痛和蔓延的傾向，可以診斷。</p>
<p>（問）這種病勢凶險的程度怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）大多數是佳良的。但在初生兒和產褥婦興及心臟衰弱的人都不良。死亡率有百分之五到十。</p>
<p>（問）丹毒的治療法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）局部用油類鑛脂或魚石脂軟膏塗布。</p>
<p>或用氷囊，或冷濕布塗包。此外注射抗鏈球菌血淸，膠狀銀液都有效。對於頭痛和發熱，可内服「非那西汀」「安替比林」「霹雷米同」等退熱藥。心臟衰弱時用樟腦「狄加令」等强心藥。</p>

<h3>肺結核淺説（四）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>（四）接觸傳染。關於病人的衣服，寢具，飲食器，痰唾，排泄物，以及一切接近病人的用具，都可以發生傳染的。</p>
<p>上面所述的四種途徑，當然以一四二種，和肺結核關係最深切；尤以空氣吸入，是最易發生傳染的，他是無孔不入，而防不勝防的，一方面又極容易被人忽視的。這一點，我希望讀者們，無論已病未病，都應該特别留意纔好。此外像接吻一件事，在歐美夫婦親子方面，是狠盛行的；就這一點，已有被結核菌侵襲的可能了！還有外陰部，有時亦可以被侵襲的。但這種事實，究竟比較少一點，證據也還没有完全充分；所以我在此處，也一慨從略了。　　最後，我想讀者還許要問；肺結核這一個病，是不是能由父母遺傳給子女們呢？換一句話説·就是；有没有先天性肺結核病呢？這一個問題，可算一直到現在，還没有完滿的答案。我們要曉得·結核菌由父體的精子，直接帶到母親的卵子裏面，像梅毒病一樣的情形，是始終没有事實來作證明的。但在母體中的胎兒，患結核是有徵的，因爲結核菌由胎盤而傳給胎兒，是可能的。不過這樣的情形，是很鮮見的：就是在胎盤中，尋到結核菌或結核性病灶，也是不容易辦到的事。這一種的可能性，大半係因母親患肺結核的關係，並且這病是恰巧在進展不已的時節，纔能成功的。否則當然不會發生這樣事的。</p>
<p>結核菌一經吸入，是不是固定留在人體裏面呢，這種情形是不一定的。我們要曉得，在人類氣管枝黏膜上面，有一種顫毛，他是專司排痰工作的；如果氣管枝是完全健全的，那末，這結核菌當然也可以排除的。不過有時結核菌侵入太多了，那是排除而不勝其排除的。還有氣管枝黏膜。有時也是能力不全的，在這個時候，當然也不能盡排除之責的。尋常氣管枝炎氣管枝肺炎等病，過後很容易發生肺結核，就是這種緣故。</p>
<h3>外傷出血臨時處置</h3>
<p>— 計濟霖</p>
<p>心臟爲圓錐肌肉性空洞之器官。其大小因人而殊。位於胸前第五六肋骨間。偏於左。俗謂心居人身之中部者誤也。血液爲人身營養之原料。而其運輸總機關卽在心臟。血管運輸所經之管。名曰血管。有動脈靜脈毛細管之分。由心臟輸出血液至身體各部之血管。名曰動脈。由身體各部輸入血液於心臟之血管。名曰靜脈。介於動靜脈之間名曰毛細管。</p>
<p>身體各部。不論何處。均有血管密佈。動脈因血流較急。偶有損傷。血流遠迸。不易制止。有失血之虞。故常居於身體深部。隱隱寓有保護之意。靜脈則逼近體面。呈蒼靑色。得由皮面蹤其所之。勞動之人。皮下常見靑筋者。卽靜脈也。吾人處世。常與萬物相接觸。意外之事。在所難免。故偶一不愼。因外力之突擊。使身體上發生損傷。輕者僅使皮膚變色。重者傷及深部。能使血管斷裂。鮮血直噴。勢如奔牛。若不從速救止。命在斯須。都市醫院林立。不難延醫治理。鄉僻之處。交通不便。往往因延醫不及。損失多量血液而死者。比比皆是。本篇之作。蓋爲不及延醫臨時救急之法。較之束手徬徨者。略勝一籌耳。血管分爲三種。旣如上述。故外傷出血。亦有動脈性，靜脈性，毛細管性之分。茲分述之。</p>
<p>（一）動脈性出血動脈富彈力性。且其管壁堅密。非至受傷過劇。不易破裂。一至破裂之後。卽有鮮紅色之血。作放綫狀之迸出。且因心臟之搏動。而爲一收一放之出血現象。（心臟之搏動。與動脈之收放相符合。）如其傷僅及小血管。以血管之收縮。受周圍組織之壓迫。嘗能自止其血。不幸傷及大幹血管。非急施適當之救治。則有失血危矣。</p>
<p>（二）靜脈性出血血色常爲暗赤色。血流不急。頻頻自管口流出。雖小靜脈出血。危險甚少。而其大幹之出血。則有生命之危。當早爲處置。</p>
<p>（三）毛細管出血又名實質性出血自多數毛細管流出血液。其色在動靜脈之間。常於舌唇，骨體，及富有血管之腫痬等處見之。因血液之凝固。往往能自止共而。但逢血友病之病人。因其血液缺乏凝固性。雖微小之創傷。血流不止。發生危險。此病　抵由遺傳面來。</p>
<p>止血之　，　　　　　　　　　　久之法。如血管結紥法，防腐塞法，血管挫碎法等等。均須醫生行之。至暫時止血之法。爲一種救急處置。如能認淸爲動脈性出血。則用手指强壓傷處之上部。靜脈性出血。用指强壓傷處之下部。惟手指不耐久用。易生疲勞。不妨以淸潔綳帶纏繞之。同時並須緊壓出血之部。能達止血之目的。若無此等綳帶。則以淸潔之布片代之。切不可以不潔之物。壓迫出血部。因微生物之傳染。而生不良之結果也。出血部如在四肢。除行上法外。並須高舉四肢。有輔助止血之效。如傷在鼻部。致鼻内出血。暫時須緊扼鼻腔。並以冷水手巾。敷包前額及後頸。如仍不見效。則以鹽水浸棉花塞入鼻腔。卽可止血。至毛細管之出血。以淸潔綳帶緊壓創面。卽能自止。近有人倡用傷部寒冷法。亦頗著偉效。卽將出血部。浸入消毒之冷水。或包以冰塊。此乃利用寒冷之剌戟。使傷處血管收縮。以達止血之目的。惟其效甚暫。因一去冷水或氷塊。血管復擴張。血液仍源源流出。欲補救其弊。須於冷水或冰塊去後。包以温水。以促血液之凝固。此蓋因血液之凝固。需要相當之温度。寒冷法雖能使血管迅速收縮。然血液在强寒之冰點下。反難凝固也。故出血時。如欲施用寒冷法。則其用後須繼用温煖法。</p>
<p>除土述之法外。尙有應用藥物以止血者。普通用過養化鐵液。因其有凝固血液之效。通常以棉花或紗布浸此液。貼於出血部。但此藥不見奏效者有之。又有用乾燥性止血棉者。卽浸棉花於過養化鐵液。而製成者也。此外如明礬水，腎上腺液等。均有止血之效。吾人不妨略備之。以防萬一也。</p>
<h3>論梅毒之療法（六○六·九一四果能完全治愈梅毒否）（上）</h3>
<p>— 沈恭</p>
<p>自海禁大開。人事日繁。各種疾病。乃隨人事以俱進。靑年服務社會。因交際而涉足花叢者。比比皆是。於是染花柳病者亦漸衆。而花柳病中以梅毒爲最多。蓋不唯接觸傳染。抑且遺傳子孫也。</p>
<p>梅毒之療法。有局部療法及整個療法兩種。療法本屬醫師事。然際此醫藥紛亂時期。病家殊有此類　　　必要。因　此篇。敢　　社會。　　　　　　論。而今日所謂整個療法的治療梅毒之藥品。大抵有四。卽水銀劑·砒劑鉍劑·及碘劑是也。其他尙有金劑及瘧疾療法等。當於他日再論之。</p>
<p>（一）水銀療法。此法最古。在六○六未發明以前。最爲流行。其作用原理。雖未十分明瞭。但藥一入體。卽與蛋白質結合而潛入血液及淋巴内。刺激體内細胞。且得直接阻碍病原體之生長云。水銀劑有塗擦·注射·及内服諸法。但其副作用頗多。如口内炎·齒齦炎·大腸炎·腎臟炎·皮膚炎·及多發性神經炎等。且行注射法後。有疼痛及生硬塊之弊。故今日除神經及服梅毒等施行緩進療法時應用外。人抵僅取塗擦及内服　　。</p>
<p>（二）　　療法。於四百年前。砒劑已應用於驅梅療法。至　　　　年。愛立喜氏Ｐ　　　　Ｆｒｈｌｅｃｈ始　明大○六Ｓａｌｖ　　　　　　是藥無論何期。一經應用。均屬有效。不唯直接作用於病原體。且不若水銀之有劇烈破壞性。此與化學療法之理想最近者也。六○六之種類頗多。有舊六○六（Ｄｉｏｘｙ—ｄｉａｍｉｄｏａｒｓｅｎｏｂｅｎｚｏｕｍ），俗簡稱六○六。有新六○六，卽九一四，爲應用Ｎａｔ　ｆｏｒｍａｌｄｅｈｙｄｓｕｌｆｏｘｙｌａｔ所製之Ｎａｔ　ｄｉｈｙｄｒｏｘｙｄｉａｍｉｎｏａｒｓｅｎｏｂｅｎｘｏｌｍｏｎｏｆｏｒｍａｌｄｅｈｙｄｓｕｌｏｘｙｌ。有六○六鈉。有六○六銀係黑色之粉末。有妙六○六ＭｙｏｓａｌｙａｒｓａｎＡｃｅｔｙｌａｓｅｎ卽注射於筋肉内者。有内服六○六，係白色製劑，如Ｓｐｉｒｉｏｅｄ（藥片）及Ｓｒｏｖａｓｏｌ（Ｈｏｅｃｈｓｔ）（白色粉未）等是。但内服六○六之效力。至今尙屬疑問。</p>
<p>以上所述各種之砒劑。其用法頗多。而有　亦起　作用。　血管神經　　碍，浸　　　　　耶　　兩氏反應　　血性　　　　　　　　　　　黃疽·及皮　發疹答。但現今注射方法　　。此種現象已屬罕見。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>北寗綫上</h3>
<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>談到北平，詩人口邊就有一首詩，畫家筆下就有一幅畫，平常人總不會忘記那裏有　　，有太監，而一些腦滿腸肥的更會追憶着那裏的八大胡同的昔日繁榮。</p>
<p>坐了北寗車，離開了這「京腔」的地方，不二十分鐘，鐵軌兩旁便出現了荒凉。從北平到天津，猶之從南京到上海，雖然北寗這一段路上没有千分之一的繁華像京滬綫上。比較可提的，譬如楊村站之以賣樣干出名，但快車在那裏又是不停的。</p>
<p>到了楊柳靑一帶，路熱旁常常在夏天是汪洋着水，而嚴冬是凍結着銀白的冰，眼睛裏面充滿了水不久，天津便到了。</p>
<p>在車上先可以看到那一條淤塞了的内河，水色混黃，小帆船的　桿像一叢叢的水灌木似的。小汽船很艱難地在河心裏扭走，貨物有時候頗擁擠，只是上面都標着洋字兒。</p>
<p>天津，没有像無錫那麽多的烟筒。！</p>
<p>窮人多得像燥熱天氣地皮上列陣的螞蟻。正如郁達夫所謂「不聊生而又不敢死」的那種人，穿着破大衫，破軍衣，破藍衫，破衛生衣向着急馳列車翻着白眼，滿臉泥片的女人，向車上要殘飯，一壁還賣俏地笑呢，對了，還穿着粉紅洋襪子。</p>
<p>鐵路邊，有汚水聚成的塘，顏色有黃綠紫褐，塘旁邊便是垃圾堆，煤屑層。辛克萊在屠塲上的描寫是有世界性的，塘的汚穢，塘旁的兒童，臭氣燻蒸下，支加哥和天津並没有兩樣呵！</p>
<p>北寗車輛是有名的，有一列是過去爲國聯調查團預備的，現在還留在秦皇島給遊歷團乘坐。憑良心説，北寗車的三等車還不太壞，在北方。車行中，你可聽到天津衛的茶房打着天津衛腔勸人喝茶。天津人和天津蘿蔔似的，脆而辣！</p>
<p>軌兩旁的護路樹，在北寗路上較整齊。夏天時，　陰映車上，使旅客心裏發凉。爲了　，山海關外的義勇軍曾在鐵這綫活躍，結果大部被斫去了。　　車到唐山，走得便較慢，人總有點幻覺，感到地下是空洞的，車震得地心有迴聲發唱。但事實上也眞有幾分可信，開　的礦港在地心内網似的開展着，有地方已空虚，並不稀奇。有些人在發愁，唐山會陸陷呢！</p>
<p>唐山，現在據説有點「三不管」的現象了。當舖收當活人，已經是不稀罕事，而還有大批人販子在唐山作肉的交易。　　當這北國天剛發暖，草方靑，麥才吐葉，地皮上還未被掩罩着，那戰跡與血痕，在沿綫是不難爲明眼人所發見的。假如到了「滿洲國，」不再提自己是「中國人，」則生命亦可無虞。　　北寗綫上是富國際性的！</p>
<h3>尊嚴</h3>
<p>— 律君</p>
<p>一個人應該感覺自我之尊貴，尤其是受高等敎育的學生。例如英國伊敦的Ｂｏｙｓ，便有一種華貴的風度。中國昔日之學院，其學生的氣致，也凛然不可犯，自覺居四民之首，是以「天下」爲己任的。社會上極推崇讀書人，優待他們。</p>
<p>聽説在歐洲各國，皆極力優待學生，奬學金甚普遍，求學的環境良好，大學生購物，聽戲，養病，皆特别廉價，在社會上自由自在，没有人敢侵犯他們。</p>
<p>但居然在北平有當局請大學女生去招待外賓了，而且，先得濱習，以免失儀，去奉陪洋大人跳舞，游園。——當然，這次當局頗碰釘子了，不但大學女生不去，外賓也大多没有去。</p>
<p>我們通常紀念國恥，那許多到時常是外侮而已，但這類事居然出自政府的　更，可眞算政府的恥辱了。「臥薪嘗膽」那種話本來荒唐，「收復失地」的口號又不聽到有人提起了。當局要我們大學的女學生，去陪日本官吏跳舞，逛頤和園，可知不是事出無因，而是一貫的道理。　　五四運動以來，不時常有「民氣」「民氣」的呼聲麽？每當民氣稍一消沈，當局　出演怪劇，一幕又一幕。西洋習慣雖可以嚇老百姓，然倒未曾聽到倫敦市長派倫敦大學的女士，「招待」德法的外賓游園；柏林大學的女生，卽倒霉也未見與法國人跳舞。只有最近東京有過園游會，招待「滿洲國」官吏，有少女歌舞，那是只有日本人才會弄的玩意。但卽令卑劣到了極致，也還没有帝國大學的女學生。</p>
<p>雖然燕京大學也提出質問了；這種丢醜的官吏，終於不會認錯的。「兒女乃家家所有，良用痛心」，所以昔日曾有女生在當時囗囗門首喋血，後來還有　三河縣的老媽子，痛打「毛丫頭」，這皆是陳跡了。今，昔，如此，可知將來也未必會兩樣。</p>
<p>學生一蕭條，在社會上失去其高貴和尊嚴，这成族的前途，便更加黯淡了。</p>
<h3>廬隱死了</h3>
<p>— 劉大杰</p>
<p>在十一年前，就以白話文寫小説，並且在當時的文壇，曾以她的作品，獲得了相當地位的作家黃廬隱女士，於今天（五月十三號）上午十一時二十分，在大華醫院的十四號病室裏死去了。</p>
<p>這是一個多麽驚奇多麽悲慘的消息！對於麽　女士的親朋們，以及對於愛讀廬　的作品而没有和她見過面的　者們。想起來，人生眞是一個夢，眞像一縷靑烟。六七天前，一個活潑而又健康的，快樂而又親切的廬隱，在今天一間昏暗的病房裏，帶着枯瘦的悲哀的面孔，同這個世界，同這個社會，同我們這般朋友，在苦痛的呌喊裏長辭了。</p>
<p>這一次眞死得寃枉。在丨個科學文明物質文明極高的上海，她被一個没有科學知繼的醫生殺死了。一個女人生產一個孩子，無論怎樣難產，在鹥學發達的今日，要死一個人是很難的，何况她並不是難產。只是他們亂用手術，傷了子宫，流血過多，等送到大華醫院的時候，已經是氣息奄奄，經過了多數醫生的救護，到底没有辦法，在幾個朋友的看護之下，她忍痛地閉着她長眠的眼睛了。</p>
<p>我和廬　，有過七八年的友誼，最近的三年，同住在上海，來往更密。時時同着打牌，喝酒，吃飯，我們幾乎無話不談，好像是姊弟一般。她的個性極强。表面是一個樂天主義者，内心却是一個極其悲觀的人。她這四年來，因爲得了一個性情温厚的唯建，一位樂天的詩人，在精神生活上，總算得了一點慰安。没有想到他們的令人羨慕的夫婦生活，就這人短促的告終了。</p>
<p>她遺下了兩個女孩子，一個十歲，一個三歲。小的孩子，好像一點也還没有感到死的悲哀和恐怖似的，她母親臨終的時候，手裏抱着一隻花旗橘，正吵着要剝皮呢！</p>
<p>關於廬隱的生平，我想唯建一定有文章記載的。關於她的作品，和她同我們夫婦的友誼生活，過兩天，我想再草一篇比較詳細一點的回憶記。</p>
<p>她的後事，唯建完全浸在沉痛的悲哀裏，動也不能動，只好由舒新誠兄和我倆人負責。定五月十四（禮拜一）六點鐘，舉行蓋棺禮。希望她的親朋和愛讀她的作品的人，到海格路中國殯儀館，看看她死了以後悲慘的面容。</p>
<h3>給兒童讀些什書？</h3>
<p>— 高爾基作左企譯</p>
<p>。那就是説，我們必須把兒童從因襲的傳統思想裏解旋出來，從舊時基於階級鬥爭的生活方式的謬誤，個人力圖自存以及確認個人主義與國家主義爲人類社會底不易定理的謬誤裏解放出來。</p>
<p>一直從兒童幼年時代起，必須使他們抛開　去的一切，甚至在遊戲的事情上面。要做到這一點，我們不僅要使他們洞悉歷史上的事蹟，已往的時代思想與學説，還得説明這些事蹟和學説怎樣從某一社會底一般的生產過程中發生的。我們必須指點明白，祇有在人們能完全自由地從事於生活必需的工作時，纔談得到思想自由丨這情形在以前從未普遍過，但是在社會主義的制度下却是一種基本的狀態。</p>
<p>所謂確定不易的事實，往往含有保守的作用，使思想局眼於明顯内事物，因而　鈍並妨碍了悟解力。但是馬克斯曾　明事實本身是有創造力的。他曾明白地指出，人生悲劇和人間疾苦底根本原因乃是存在於勞動者底伶俐的手腦間的人爲的裂　。</p>
<p>我們須把歷史上的人類從朦朧的過去時代以及其始初的半意識的生活形態進化而來的情形指示給兒童看。務必使他們知道一點從石斧底發明者到史蒂芬孫和狄塞耳（柴油引羣發明者）所經歷的途程，從荒誕不稽的童話底創始人到己經指示我們以光明的人生大道的學説所經歷的途程。在兒童踏進一個新的世界，一個技術減輕勞力的世界，和没有階級的社會時，應得知道肉體勞動底重要，以及勞工怎樣改變自然底面目而創造一個新的環境，一個「第二自然。」</p>
<p>同時要使他們知道：要是人類自發的勞動底自由不曾被歷來統洽階級底自私與貪慾所桎梏，所限制，人類早就無限地超越了一般文化底現階段了。</p>
<p>富有能力的人類正在創造一個「第二自然」，一個新的文化環境；人類是自然底代理人，　　　　　　　　　　的　　和改造而創　他的：此辕意議必須深印在兒童心　　因此，要使兒童認識人生，須從關於遠古時代，關於人類勞動底起源和思想底發厘等故事入手。</p>
<p>欲創作一種藝術的和敎育的兒童文學，必先養成能够簡單地，　人地，而且有益地表現他們的思想的天才作家；必先養成具有政治及文學根底的有素養的編者；此外還得要有出版上的便利。</p>
<p>惟其因爲這一切工作不能一蹴而幾，我們此時就得着手進行了。現在且把創作一種兒童新文學所必須注意到的幾個題材開示於此也許不無補益吧。</p>
<p>簡單的説來可得下列變個綱領：地球；空氣；水；植物；動物；人類怎樣出現於地球上；人類怎樣發展其思想；人類怎樣克配火底使用；人類怎樣設法减輕勞力與生活負擔；鐵及其他金屬底支配對於人類有何關係；科學的奇蹟；思想與行爲；未來的技術；宗敎的性質；科學怎樣使人類變成巨人；從蒸汽機到柴油引擎；人類及其環境。</p>
<p>特别重大的一件工作，便是給兒童寫些關於私有財產的發生及　對於現代人類進化有何阻碍的這一類書。</p>
<p>我們必須覓取一等的作家和藝術家，寫作一些關於世界各地民族實况的書籍和圖畫。關於蘇聯境内的民族情形最好讓散居蘇聯各地的地理學者和參加各種探險工作的人們告訴我們。他們將説明這些民族底生活形態，同時養成兒童一種國際觀念。</p>
<p>總之，我們必須把整個兒童文學重行建築在一個新的原則上，給文學的，科學的和藝術的理解　　一條寛　的新途徑</p>
<p>人類社會中間正在進行着一種鬥爭，以圖勞苦大衆底勞力得從私有財產制度及資本主羲制度底壓迫之下解故出來。這是想把人類的體力變成智力的一種鬥爭。這是金圖戰勝自然力，爭取健康和長壽，爭取人顃底團結，爭取人類智能底自由發展的鬥爭。</p>
<p>這一個原則應該是一切兒童文學底根基。我們該牢記舊時的怪　不稽的童話故事憑了科學底力量現在已經變成事實了。我們要給兒童以根據最進步的現代科學假説寫成的故事；要使他們不但運算和批判，並　是有想像和　瀏的能力。　　在兒童文學裏面，文藝書和通俗科學書之間不　有　然的界限。這應該怎樣　做得到？怎樣使敎科書生動而富有情感？</p>
<p>科學與發明不應當寫成一篇現成的發見與發明底總帳，應當寫成人類與物質阻力及傳統思想搏擊的戰塲。此類書篩底編著者應該是研究有素的科學家，不應該是朿抄西襲的編書匠。要有眞正的科學家和才具高超的作家底合作，我們纔能從事出版以藝術手腕傳布科學知識的書籍。</p>
<p>一切事業家丨如獲户，船員，航空家，農藝家，耕種機站（Ｍａｃｈｉｎｅｔｒａｃｆｏｒｓｔａｔｉｏｎ）服務人員等丨應當恊助著作家，將他們的生活經騐貢獻於兒童文學。</p>
<p>當然，這裏所説的只是　做工作底大槪情形，還得要經過審愼的詳細的考是　是。我們當然馬上組織起一個靑年科學家及文學家底團體，專做這一件工作。</p>

<h3>病囚雜記</h3>
<p>— 嘯龍</p>
<p>（六）病囚之侣</p>
<p>第二天，血也止了。痛楚也减少了一點了。我也　能　説話了。於是我漸漸地開始認識我的同房的病囚之侣。</p>
<p>我們的房裏一共是四個人。進門口第一個是一個年才八九歲的小孩子。他病的是骨癆，爲了最先給庸醫所誤，結果他被抬進這病院來的時候，便不得不給醫生用手術把他的一部份的性器官割去。這對於他將來的生殖機能有没有影響，我們都不　了了。至於他自己，恐怕更不會想到。唯其是他不　什麽呌做憂慮，所以在我們這一班不幸者之羣裏，他是比較最幸福的。他能够隨便吃什麽東西。他能够隨便説話而不覺得吃力。除了換藥的時候；他不會感到什麽痛苦。就是在換藥而感到痛苦的時候，他可以盡量地大哭一場，這已經是比我們更幸福的，因爲我們到底不能盡量發洩怨苦，我們還能够　啕大哭嗎？還有使我們羨慕的是，不單祗在夜裏，甚至在白天，他也可以很舒服地酣睡，比起我們都得在深夜才能入睡的幾個，眞要感到那不曾給憂患闖入過的孩童之心是最可懷　的。</p>
<p>第二個是一個在銀行裏面做事的行員。他是爲了胃病來這裏受割治的。我進來的時候已經是他受手術後的第三天。因爲他需要更有力的麻醉的原故，據説他經了一小時多的手術以後，一直到現在，還不曾感覺過些微的疼痛，雖然他有一隻手還不曾回復咸覺。這在我看來，他的毫無痛苦已經使我覺得他是比我幸福的。大槪因爲流血比較多一點，所以使他非常疲弱。他曾感喟地，却又幽默地對我説，説胃病是最可憐的。他説倘若他的胃病不能够好，同時又患了那同房的孩子的一樣的病的話，那末人生最大的兩種快樂也没有了，到這樣的情景，縱使穿了最漂亮的友服，住着最宏麗的房子，也有什麽興趣呢，不如索性躺在墳基裏面好了。　　我們聽了都不覺笑了起來。一個從實際的痛苦經騐説出來的話，往往是比哲學家埋頭十年所發表出來的理論更爲眞切的。</p>
<p>第三個床位躺着的便是我。第四個是一個學生，一個快要痊愈的傷寒病患者。他是在我們幾個當中在心　上最能感到安慰的人。因爲他是一個虔誠的篤信基督敎的，他常常自己低低地唱着聖詩，低低地念着禱詞，當我聽他説這一塲病恐怕要誤了畢業的考試，因而對他表示惋惜的時候，他却非常平靜地回答，説這是無可怨尤的上帝的旨意。因此當他問我是否是基督徒時，我立刻回給他一個「是」字，我知道這一定要給他很大的快樂的。</p>
<p>這裏，我領悟到了宗敎的能够存在的原因。</p>
<p>這樣，我們這不幸的四個，彷彿是帶罪的囚犯，整天被關在這小小的房子裏，失却了一切的自由。我們不能够多説話，可是我們彼此用目光酬答着，雖然相識的時間是這麽的短促，可是我們的交情是眞摯的。</p>

<h3>今年農村經濟如何　—最近數月來的觀察—</h3>
<p>— 羅明鈞</p>
<p>去年農村復興的呼聲響撤雲霄，而於稻絲棉麥茶的生產技術的改進，之爲注意。今年的農村經濟如何？卽以過去四月的情形觀之，已足以見今年的前途。今年入春以來，卽見各地農產物的一般衰落。春季和秋季新穀登塲時的情形不同，按照以前例子，穀價比較秋季必高，而今春各省產米之區，穀價仍襲去秋所謂「豐收在災」時之低價，甚且比前更爲跌落。如江·浙·皖·贛·湘·鄂等省，入春以來，米價之低落，爲近五六年來所少見，無錫·崑山·常熟一帶的白粳，市斛每石祗售洋六七　这譜。產地米價低落的原因，主要的是都市的米市塲爲洋米所奪，國米在原產地因運輸的不便，苛捐雜税的阻礙，以及中間商人多層的剝削，致不能運往需要米的地方。這種情形已成爲經常的現象，換言之，以稻爲主要種植物的農民，决不能希　今年能因氣候雨量等偶然的或種條件的順　，而改進他們的生活。</p>
<p>不僅作爲中國主要的農產的稻是如此，就是其他各種的農產物也均在衰落中。如三月　十九日南華日報載；「廣東省因受土穀米價日趨跌落，四鄉座糧產品，近亦爲外來雜糧所打擊，同樣滯銷。如土　生油，前年每担售價三十八元，現已跌至廿二三元。」三月十日新聞報載；「四川邊境雅安地方以產茶著名，惟近年銷路日减，茶價日跌。民國元年每票約八十五斤五元，民十二年五元，最近每票只値四元三角。」三月十八日大公報載：「山東絲製品，以往由烟台，龍口等沿海各地出口，每年約達三千萬元，連運銷其他各處出口時，每年共在五千萬元以上，現在已完全停滯。山東的花生油每年出口至少亦在三千萬元以上，現在積貨很多，銷路全無。</p>
<p>農產物因銷路衰落，必然的可影響於生產量的衰落外，而在今日各種的社會條件下，更是在在促進農產物生產的衰落。據二月二十日申報載江蘇嘉善通訊：「本縣長楊　春蒞任後，對於田賦方面，異常注意，並鑒於賦從租出，欲積極整頓糧賦，非先整頓田租不可。特傳諭在押各佃户，如欠本年租米被禁者，飭具殷實舖保開釋，但須在半月内如數淸償，否則依法處置。」另據某報載，江蘇常熟縣押佃所中，至今尙押有去年欠租的佃農數百人，縣府近鑒於春耕播種期届，不得不特准各佃農交保開釋，但須先爲償淸在押時期的伙食者，結果在押佃農還是無法出所。在這種情形之下，卽使佃農能出所恢復耕作，而因農本的缺乏，穀價的跌落，結果不過仍受宰於商業資本家，高利貸資本家及地主，使這種悲慘的命運，又多一次輪迴而已。</p>
<p>最近，江蘇江北一帶，春荒的現象已成，浙江蕭山一帶著名產絲的區域，今當養蠶的時候，而蠶種價跌，銷路比去年减少了三分之一。本來農民體騐到過去幾年的經騐，辛勤一載，往往還是得不償失，因而放棄田地不耕，蠶桑不求的也很多。蠶如擔江蘇常熟縣某民敎館調查，顧方橋農村的結果，「在所調查的一一三○畝稻田中，去冬所產稻穀僅有一三四八石，每畝平均產稻不過一石二斗。再加以農產價格底狂跌，每畝收入僅四元八角。但每畝耕種成本，却需種子費洋三角，肥料費洋一元五角，共計一元八角；其餘三元則由租工資等均在内。因此佃農產收入大都是虧欠的。據上述調查所得，佃農耕田在五畝以下者，每家每年本均收入七十元，平均支出一百元，虧三十元，耕田十畝以下者收入一百元，支出百二十元，虧二十元。二十畝以下者收入百六十元，收支始能相同。」（二月二十五日大晚報）</p>
<p>或因去年普遍的災荒之後，農村金融更形枯竭，以致生產範圍更爲縮小。譬如農民育蠶，自備蠶本的向來很少，多由當地兩行，商店·以及地主富紳等先爲支借，以後卽以絲繭作償。但過去幾年絲價跌落，絲商虧折頗多，農民所借之欵，多不能及時歸還。基於這種情形，今年蠶絲的生產自必較以前要减少。而且，農村金融的枯竭是農村經濟破產的基本原因之一，並非部份的救濟所能竟功。譬如某省爲救濟農村金融，舉辦農民銀行，貸欵與農民，銀行的基金是向所有農民每畝抽取二角，放欵的對象雖是信用合作社，而信用合作社的社員則爲有抵押的農民。這樣，祗有經濟能力較强的農民始能受其惠，而貧農却先受了分派基金的負担。華洋義賑會在湘鄂等災區信用放欵，結果少數的貸金多給地主高利貸者以種種方法所吸盡，貧農到期無法淸償，惟有喪失再借的「借用。」都市銀行資本家的農業放欵，根本上祗是銀行業務的一種，實惠不及於無「信用」可言的貧產。</p>
<p>去年天災遍各省，今年雖爲時尙早，災荒未到旺盛之期，而將繼續發生，則預兆早見，如二月六日由報載：「去年黃河三處决口，驤成空前巨災。現蘭封及水龐莊兩處口門雖已堵合，而北岸石頭莊之口門，至今仍無結果。且凌汎旣至，冰積如山，工程益難收拾，爲禍依然慘重。卽沿河兩岸堤壩，經此次冲刷，塌陷殘毁，較前尤甚。若不亟圖善義，切實培修，則瞬届汎期，遑論再遇洪流則潰决泛濫，北下浸衛，可波及津沽，南下奪淮，可禍及蘇皖，陸沉巨災，固不堪設想。卽幸遇中常水位，則沿河居民，亦必遭其魚之厄。」又如三月十四日中華日報載：「冀省永定河之工費六萬元，尙無着落。現該河水勢甚猛，且沿河堤埝坍塌倒壞之處亦甚多，若不趕辦春工，危險堪虞。」</p>
<h3>中國農產貿易狀况與運銷合作</h3>
<p>— 和法</p>
<p>自從資本主義侵入後，中國農民的農產物及日用品卽捲入商品的漩渦，以前自耕面食，自　而衣的地方經濟的特性，卽被破壞無餘。不但農民自己所生產的農產物，必須出賣，以換取現金，而農民自用的簡單而低劣的日用品，也須依賴於市塲。在這種的塲合，農村中的貿易問題遂成爲直接影響到農民生活的重要的農村經濟問題之一面。</p>
<p>隨着農業恐慌的擴大，中國農民之農產物的商品化程度也與日俱深。苛捐雜税，高租厚賦的榨壓，驅迫農民不得不出售其隔宿糧。在災荒嚴重的時候，農民連農具田地尙要出賣，自必更無論農產物了。因之，愈在經濟衰落或農業恐慌的區域，愈是經濟能力弱小的貧農，農產的貿易關係對於他們生活，影響也愈大。　　根據各地的農村調查，中國農民的出售其農產物，常和借貸相聯繫，換言之，卽中國農村中的商業資本與高利貸資本，彼此結合，不能分離。商業資本以高利貸資本的形式而出現於農村貿易關係中的，便是農民的農產物之「預　「或」抵押」。</p>
<p>中國農民的出售其農產物，雖未必全以預賣與抵押的方式，但採取這種方式的可説至少是大　數。根據上海商品檢騐局調查全國棉花在產地貿易情形，報告説：「鄉僻之處，棉農出售棉花，曰原始市塲，中國小農居多，故種植棉花時，恒以所產棉花爲抵押，向米商雜貨商或棉販借貸金錢。於八·九·十·十一月間，摘棉之期，放欵者收買棉農之棉花，搜照訂定價目，罕照市上之實價」。又該局調查浙江於潛縣的桐籽貿易，也是一樣情形。其報告中説：「於桐籽未出新之時，顧客先行放欵與桐農，雙方規定其油籽品質，交貨期限，及其價値，其定價之高下，視貸欵之多寡，交貨之限期爲衡率。　桐籽未出新之時，卽先估定其價格，不免含有重利意　，桐　　　其剝削」。其他各種農產物，也均以預賣及抵押爲主，如在浙江長興，有所謂放夏米，在臨安縣有所謂放靑稻，在武康縣有所謂抵竹，以至平湖縣的賣白頭桑，嘉興縣的放靑葉錢，安徽潛山縣的妖風稻，陝西沔縣的支賣等，都是同一性質的農產抵押及預賣。</p>
<p>以預賣或抵押的方法出售農產，農民不但負担重重苛刻的高利，而且價格的估定，全操之於商人，農民常有得不到原値「半的價格的。但是各的負担驅迫農民不能不忍受這種商業資本與高利貸資本的雙重剝削。</p>
<p>除了預賣以外，在經濟比較落後的地方，農民出售其農產大都是趕市集與廟會。在許多地方，每天並没有經常的市場，農民必須在市集或廟會的時候，始能把農產物售出。如以貴州省的大定縣爲例，據調查：「城市與村市，都是定期舉行，城市每四日一次，村市每六日一次。農民各就近處市集，以物賣錢，更以錢買所需之物」。</p>
<p>市集和廟會貿易的特性，是貿易時間的過短與日期的距隔，就爲了這種特性，農民在貿易上卽受了重大的損害。因爲農產物的不易久藏，與一般的貧乏下農民需要現欵的急迫，所以每逢市集，不論價格的升降，農民便不得不把其農產物售出，在這種塲合，農民所處的地位，不過較預實及抵押較佳而已。</p>
<p>因中國所行的是普遍的小農佃，農民所生產的農產物數量不多，所以農民出售其農產，卽使不以預賣及抵押的方式來進行，也不在市集或廟會中出售，則均經過多層的中間人的剝削。如農村中米販，糧行等都是在農產物初步貿易中最有勢力的中間人。再如各地遍立的牙行，更是農村中農產貿易的中鍵，大部份的農產物必須先經過牙行之手，而後才能運銷出去。據北平社會調查所的調查：「牙行的收入主要的爲牙佣，而牙佣必在交易成立後，才可收到，故貪得的牙行，必盡力謀交易額的增加，有不易成的交易，則務爲雙方遮隱，以求其成。牙行本需雙方共信的中間人，至此則甚至犧牲雙方的利益。有時買賣的雙方，因一方的知議淺薄，容易欺騙，牙行常不惜　就另一方面的利益，犧牲他方面的利益，」是則被犧牲者，無疑的必是「知識淺薄」的農民。</p>
<p>農村中商業資本家利用農民經濟能力的薄弱，與智識的低下，自可應用各種非法的作弊方法，在農產物貿易中剝削農民，其中主要的如度量衡的差異　時價的上落，均是商人用以剝削農民的最好機會。</p>
<p>度量衡的不統　與差異之巨大，是中國各地普遍的現象，在農村中雖有合法的標凖度量衡器，商人也可棄置不用，農民卽使明知吃虧，然也無可奈何。在安徽祁門產茶區域，茶號利用不同的度量衡以盤剝茶幾，可爲一例。據報告：「當地茶號之盤剝山户，惟一手段，厥爲收買水毛茶而用大秤，普通一十二兩，折合十六兩，侵占百分之三十八；折合十三兩六錢之新制秤，侵占百分之六十二。其明以侵占者如此，至於茶市堅俏時，或用二十一兩，或二十三兩，甚至有二十四兩者。」在浙西，據社會調查所調查：「不規則的衆行家，常另備大小二斛，農民來銷售時用大斛量入，農民來購米時則以小斛糶出。大斛比較標凖斛每石有二升或一升之差異，小斛較標凖斛有時每石亦差至一千，用秤也有相類似的弊端。」</p>
<p>在農村中，物價的上落，本來漫無標凖，不但收穫的前後，農產物的價格有個很大的變動，就是在平常的時候，所有價格的上下，也均被操縱於商人豪紳之手，譬如湖北省西北各縣所有的糧價，「總是被地主及富人操縱着。」屯積糧食，壟斷市價，本是中國商人的普通營業方法，在落後的農村中，這種情形自必更甚。　　其次，如幣制的混亂，税捐的繁重，運輸的困難等，均使中國内地農民，不能把農民物運輸到市塲，直接銷售於消費者，而不得不忍受中間商人的剝削。</p>
<p>這種狀况下，農民固然因受層層的剝削而收不回成本，同時也就因爲這種層層的剝削，使中國農產物的成本增高，價格隨之不得不增高，以致無法運輸到都市中來銷售，進而形成「豐收成災」的原因之一。所以，不論在改善農民的境遇上説，或是振興農業，增加生產上説，今日當務之急，均有改變這種農產物的貿易關係的必要。</p>
<p>要改變今日農村中的農產物的貿易關係，最好的方法自然是國家統制。但國家統制農業生產與農產物貿易，因範圍過大與各地地方性的差異，其困難有甚於統制對外貿易，自非目前所能實現。　而求其次，　合現狀而又易於見效的，惟有組織農產物運銷合作社。</p>
<p>農產物運銷合作社的主要作用，是把農民各家零星的農產物收集起來，應用商業上的技術，北零爲整地直接運銷到消費市塲。這一方面固可避免許多中間人的剝削，他方面又可利用較雄厚的資力與人力，自必可得到較合理的價格。而且如統制經濟政策實行的話，這種運銷合作社也是實施統制貿易的最好的工具。</p>
<p>近來，中央政府方面對於糧食運銷有設專局之　，江蘇省農民銀行業已舉辦農產運銷，上海銀行農業放欵部的放欵對象也是同樣性質的合作社，這種措置自然可使農村中的貿易關係，爲之一變。但我們始終認定，合作事業卽使不是有其全部社會改造體系的社會主義，至少也是一種社會政策，而决不是一種營業工具或商業手段。所以，農產物運銷合作社的根本精神，在變更原來的農村中貿易關係之外，尙有其究極的目的，並不是用以替代舊的貿易方法的一種新的商業工具。它的根本精神，一方面應該使合作社成爲農民自己的東西，使農民的農產物能通過運銷合作社而直接出售於消費者，以之免除中間人的剝削，而改進農民自己的生活狀態，他方面又須以全部的國民經濟爲本位，運銷合作社負起派興農業，調節市塲的使命。如運銷合作社仍以與生產者的農民和都市中消費者無關的中間人的形式而出現，則合作事業不過仍是一種商業行爲而已。關於實施的狀况，自有待於進一步的研計。</p>
<h3>農村典當業的崩潰及其對策（續四月卅日稿）</h3>
<p>— 王宗培</p>
<p>歸納起來説，開典當旣然没有從前那樣的營業上的把握，「將本求利」的老　們，安得不心灰意懶，典當的逐漸收束，便成了自然的結果。可是我們要注意的，典當終究是農村金融的重要機關，牠的衰落，無疑地使農村金融的周轉，蒙很大的影響。本來在典當營業衰落的時候，是慈善典當代興的好機會。但是在社會經濟極度窘迫的現在，希望廣設慈善典當，無異是「痴人説夢話」。求其次，只能設法推廣典當式的抵押借貸機關，來救濟這燃眉之急。</p>
<p>所謂「典當式的抵押借貸機關」，在浙江已經有了一家，那是「龍游縣地方銀行」。牠的性質，與普通銀行不同，無以名之，就呌牠「當舖銀行」。農民們拿了短衫長袍，都可以來行押銀數角到數元，夏天當棉被，冬天押蚊帳，全年輾轉往來，川流不息，倒也很有意思的。利息只不過一分五厘，另外加收保管費六分，比了普通典當的取息二分到二分五厘，已經低了不少了。</p>
<p>龍游縣地方銀行，已經有了相當的歷史，是姜啓周氏主辦的。股本額定是一一○·九五○元，實收的股本，二十年底，不到半數，只有五一，三五○元。二十一年底，却增加到七六·七八○元，比上一年增加一五·四三○元。存欵方面，二十年底是一一四、七八三·三○四元。二十一年底比較减了一些，只有一一三·五二七·五三二元。至於放欵業務，進步比較顯著，二十年底的放欵總數爲一三六、四五七·九二六元，二十一年底增至一四四，八六五·○七二元。業務方面，因爲龍游當地没有典當，所以兼營衣類與金銀兩種抵的放欵，二十一年底的放欵，爲四五、五一二·二○○元，佔總數的百分之三一四。現在將他們二十一年份的營業報告，摘錄在下面：</p>

<p>從龍游縣地方銀行的營業報告觀察起來，縣地方的銀行，兼營衣服金銀飾物的抵押放欵，業務很有發展的可能。譬如二十一年六月底的數字，衣類抵押放欵一項，計銀四四，二七五·四○元，佔放欵總數的百分这三○·四一。同一年的冬天，這種放欵，减至銀二七三○七·六○元，僅佔放欵總數的百分这一八·八五。這種大量的减少，也很値得研究，一方面表現着農　金融的特質，農村的金融，下半年没有上半年那樣窘迨。另一方面地因爲那一年農作物的豐收，農民們才有剩餘的資金，來取贖當貨。還有一點，是質押物件的季節，照普通情形説，寒衣比夏衣値錢，夏天固然可以當了寒衣來充資金，可是到冬天，却不得不贖出度寒過歲。至於金銀抵押，也有同一的現象，不過没有衣類那樣顯而易見罷了。</p>
<p>龍游縣地方銀行，是設在龍游縣城裏的，營業的範圍，當然以縣城居其大半。四鄉離城較遠的農民，恐怕很少能够沾到這裏的福利。爲了補救這一種缺憾，似乎可以仿「接典」或「代當」的辦法，選擇比較重要的鄉鎭，設立分支機關。如果因爲設立分支機關没有把握，那末不妨試辦「巡廻式」的抵押貸欵所，排定巡廻的日程，借用鄉區公所爲臨時營業地點。這種方法，好像有一些新奇冒險，辦理日久了，或許也有相當的成效。</p>
<p>上海銀行自從成立農業合作貸欵部以後，訊定了推行合作事業是救濟中國農村經濟的基本辦法，但是他們也深知道現在我國農民敎育的缺乏，鄉村間領袖人材的不可多得。如果在短期間内希求全國合作社的普及，實在不是容易的事，所以爲了適應急需起見，在合作社的組織之外，另外研究一種典當式的農民抵押借貸所，除了押米之外，還可以兼當衣服首飾。同時他們覺得典當實在是農村金融的重要機關，不過新式的機關，像華洋義振會，平民敎育促進會等，大家都提倡合作社，他們對於這兩種新舊組織，合作社與典當也在研究其聯絡的方法。將寒研究的結果，對於典當業和合作事業，都有很大的貢獻。從事實一點説，不論是推廣典當也好，設立農民抵押借貸所也好，無論那一種的組織，日用開支是免不了的。如果要開支少，那末事業不能善遍。假使要事業普遍，那末開支必不在少數。現在開支要少，事業又要普遍，所以只能够挑選比較重要的城鐵，先行着手試辦，此後逐步推行到次要的城鎭。在次要城鎭還没有設立典當或農民抵押借貸所之前，爲農民的福利着想，也應該有巡廻式的黄當或農民抵押借貸所的組織。這種巡廻式的典當或農民抵押借貸所，拿已設立的農民抵押借貸所爲母所，分期在鄰近各鄉村　流營業。這末一來，開支雖然稍大，可是比設立許多分支所，却經濟得多。同時農民方面，也得到了借貸上充分的例利。</p>
<p>總結起來説一句話，典當的推行和農民抵押借貸所的設立，都是現在的當務之急。不過從適　目前的需要着想，開辦巡廻式的典當，或農民抵押借貸所，也許容易着手。經費省，地域大，各鄉村的農民，都有借貸的機會，所收的成效，不更要宏大嗎？（完）</p>

<h3>絲茶　浙屬春蠶優劣互見</h3>
<p>（海寗）長安許村施家堰袁家　等處、今　均指爲改良蠶區、由指導員分發改良種、孵化期　因天氣太寒、大半延　十四五日始行收　、經指導員普遍消毒以及充分指導、故在二三眠中天時迭起變化、以人工盡力救護、蠶蟻卒鮮損失、惟農民因經濟關係、飼育之土種蠶、因種子不及改良種健全、無力抵抗惡劣之氣候、損害較重、現下早蠶已大眠開葉、晚蠶亦三眠足葉、改良種蠶蟻食葉日旺、現狀轉佳、</p>
<p>（臨安）本爲模範蠶區、今届農民飼育之改良種、尙稱不弱、惜氣候太寒、出蟻延期、起眠後側重火力補温、稚蠶共育、一律飼以新桑、迨後天時步趨惡劣、經指導員日夜　護、以合理之新法補救天工、故蠶蟻不過發現滯葉失眠、損失尙微、現已轉危爲安、早帮已入大眠旺葉、惟農民解育之土種蠶、在三三眠中蠶病叢生、備受損害、</p>
<p>（新昌）黃澤一帶、今歲飼蟻較暢、奈春寒料峭、孵化延期、且因經濟衰落、孵育土種者不弱、天氣異常惡劣、蠶蟻發育備受影　響、幸有指導員更番消毒、充分協助、改良種不過發育較遲、土種蠶抵抗力薄、頗有傾棄、現下大帮已入大眠、間有還葉、經過尙好、改良種蠶現狀較優、再遲一旬、新繭可下簇、</p>

<h3>花鉛靑鉛客銷不動</h3>
<p>花旗靑鉛近來定價高昂、兼之申地匯况短縮、行情迭見增漲、計每担開十六元八角、交易本街廠家因實用關係、點綴尙旺、惟客帮買賣、因推銷不易、故少成交、是以連日客帮生意毫無、而茶帮方面、因今庚新茶市塲不振、致點綴亦微、但行情依然鋒俏、至湖南鉛行情仍開十六元三四角之譜、成交除本街廠家外、出口生意亦寥落云云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>中國民族性</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>一個民族有一個民族的特性，中國民族自然也不能例外。中國民族的特性是那幾點呢？現在且就個人觀察所及，提出來寫在下面，讓大家看看有三兩分對否：</p>
<p>一，顧面子中國人最顧面子，凡事只要面子保得住，丢醜是滿不在乎。自己無端無由給人打得頭破血流，不思抵抗，偏在事後向旁人訴説一篇大道理，以爲這樣便可爭回不少面子了，至若身被重創，算是運氣不佳。</p>
<p>二，安命運中國人因爲相信命運，所以也很安於命運，遇到有什麽不如意的事情發生，儘把牠推在命運上面去，也就覺得泰然了。樂天知命，本是我國古聖賢的重敎，我們還能不遵嗎？</p>
<p>三崇迷信迷信思想各個民族都有，不過中國像比較深些。我們不但迷信神鬼，還相信什麽八字氣數之類，又多忌諱。近來中國受外來新思想的傳染，迷信思想，已漸起動搖。只因中國人的迷信心，受悠久的傳統觀念所束縛，已是根深蒂固，故儘管有人喊着要打倒迷信，迷信勢力，却仍然存在。</p>
<p>四，尙虚禮尙虚禮也是中國人的一特性，舉凡婚喪慶弔所延用的繁文縟節，眞是麻煩之至。自然的，中國是個禮義之邦的國家，一舉一動，那里可以越出禮義的軌外。不過我們所守的禮，却並不是禮的實質，而是禮的浮面。因此，流弊所及，國人便皆以虚僞相欺詐了。</p>
<p>五，講私情中國人又喜歡講私情，事無大小，儘以私情爲轉移，這是一種封建思想的遺毒。父爲子隱，子爲父隱，算是極度普遍的情形。親友的交接往還，也無不着重於私情這一點上。卽對於公家事的處理，中國人亦往往是重私而經公的。</p>
<p>六，拘舊習社會習慣本是最不易便收的，尤其　們中國人，　約束　　　　。今日的中國社會，還留存着幾千百年前的舊風習。依理，社會一天天進步，人的生活，也跟着一天天改變，舊風習是不適於新生活的，然而守舊的中國人，却並不覺得怎樣不調和。</p>
<p>七，善耐苦中國人的生活，可説是十分貧困的。我們雖則有着極廣大的土地和極豐富的物產，但因爲我們未能利用天然的賜予，來改善我們的生活，故終歲辛勞，尙有不得温飽之虞。因之中國人爲生活所鞭策，不知不覺就養成了一種忍苦耐勞的品性。幸而我國人平素是很守已安分的，所以雖過着度的勞苦生活，也並不感到怎樣難堪。</p>
<p>以上算是我的中國民族性觀了。或許有人要説，我所提出幾點，都是偏於惡劣的方面，而缺略了優美的方面，難道中國人便没有一二可取的長處？我以爲有想是不會没有的，不過我所看到的，只是這些吧了。畫蛇添足，是愈見其失眞的。</p>
<h3>科學靈乩圖</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>我國自來科學不甚發達，這是誰都承認的。然而我國之有科學花生米，想也是大家所知道的吧？這還不算希奇，科學扶乩法才是滑天下之大稽呢！要是你肯破費兩隻角子，包管你在三分鐘之内，不費吹灰之力，立刻可以多得到一點科學上的新知識。</p>
<p>原來近日市上到處發見了一種「科學靈乩圖」，乃香港科學游藝社所編印，據報上廣告所説，發明者爲一留德的博士，圖頗簡單用一張黃紙製成，當中畫一個鬼臉（也許是鬼臉吧）？周團一層層環繞着無數小字　。另外附一紙説明畫，和一塊畫着同樣鬼臉的小磁碟。扶乩法是這樣的；把碟子安置在黃紙中央，三個人各伸出一隻右手，用一指按在碟子上，心裏默默地唸着「煩碟仙請某某到來談話」，約十分鐘光景，碟子就會轉動起來。（這時算是碟仙降臨了），待到碟子停住，看牠停在什麽地方，卽依那處的字，併成句子，來解釋陰魂所説的是什麽話。據説，這圖是某博士費盡多年心血，才研究成功，純用科學方法構就，絲毫不帶迷信作用，非平常扶乩法可比。至若靈騐，那不消説，「誠則靈」，只要扶乩者心誠意虔，無不百試百騐的。</p>
<p>我國人民眞够聰明，不但花　　可用科學方法製造，使食物科學化，卽扶乩也得用科學原理改良，使迷信科學化。科學的力量旣這麽萬能，若得我國大科學家如某博士者，繼續苦心研究下去，我敢擔保，在不久的將來，科學吃飯法，科學拉矢法，科學戀愛術，科學自殺術，科學ＸＸＸ，科學ＸＸＸ</p>
<p>一定可以不斷地發明出來。這於我國不是很有貢獻嗎？進而再發明一二種科學禦侮術，科學强國法，那末，收復東北失地算得什麽，中國也許馬上就要變成世界上的頭等國了！</p>
<p>我國自盤古氏開闢天地以到現在，歷代有什麽新發明，大都是秘而不宣，這種心理是很錯誤的。爲救此弊起見，我以爲這種「科學靈乩圖」，實有向世界普及的必要。這不獨可爲中國爭光榮，抑且有利於世界學術界。下次如有世界任何科學會議要開會，我先來向政府建議，不要再派什麽丁文江翁文灝一班人去出席，最適當的人物，還是發明「科學靈乩圖」這位博士了。</p>
<p>如某博士者者，可謂神通廣大矣。怪不得班禪大師所主持的時輪金剛法會會有消災解禍的法力呢！</p>
<h3>隔壁阿姐（江陰民歌）</h3>
<p>— 猛</p>
<p>「他起仔哈哄來要想停，我格工，停他工來我一家六口只好喫西風！</p>
<p>我勿曉得爲倽靠仔十只指頭要嘸飯喫？爲倽來要碗飯喫，就要　面孔？」</p>
<h3>談體面</h3>
<p>— 淸</p>
<p>如今這社會，是一個只重衣衫不重人的社會，故此體面也便成爲處世立身的一大工夫。這事實我們如果留意一下，幾乎是隨時隨地可以碰見。最明顯的可以舉出電車上的情形來作例。我們經常地遇到一個衣履襤褸的人跑進頭等車　，那　　　就　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　三等在後邊。意思分明例是輕　他没有資格，假使幸而能免忝居爲頭等的貴客，不被賣票擋了駕。但是同座一些衣冠楚楚的士女們也必定頻頻地拿着神氣十足的眼光釘着那人，或者顯出一種非常厭惡的樣子，好像是受到一種同流合汚的侮辱。諸如這般情形，不獨電車上爲然，在其他任何塲合一下都莫不如此。衣服不齊整或是破裂的，不問你是一個如何人格高尙，學識深博的人，無論到什麽地方，總是不免遭人白眼，奚落瞧不起，不反你當人看待。反過來説，要是你如裝來入時而又漂亮，則無論你是一個無惡不作的强盜，或者是徒有其表的行屍走肉，人總對你表示相當的敬意，樂得和你週旋。時尙所趨，人亦不能免俗，因此大家都講究體面，因爲不如此就得一輩子吃癟。所以卽使空着肚子，家中在半食半餓之中，而在外面，仍然必要長袍大褂西裝革履，顯出十分闊綽的模樣來。</p>
<p>體面於是可以説是等於一個人的門面門面堂皇的同時便是一種身價的標記，世人也均由此增减其對於你的好惡的程度。譬如你要游大人之門托人求差，應先正其儀容，整其衣冠，務使不露出絲毫的寒傖氣，至少對方得看你的份兒，跟你敷衍，如果是帶着一副癟二的窮酸相呢那不光只有換得一種鄙蔑的報酬，甚至未登大人之堂，已被差役給滾了出來。這些，咱自己就不知經騐過多少次，曾記得有一回，同一個朋友到衙門内去看一位官朋友，自己是無職無位的咸陽一匹夫，可爲因穿着較塲面的衣服，佔了便宜，於是都用不着通報，儘管大搖大擺跨了進去。而另外的朋友祇因一身四不像的束裝，樣子有些像流氓。守衛兵馬上就把他攔住，不讓他走，後來麻煩了半天，才放行。已經够掉臉了。這樣看來，足見得體面一件事實在有極大的效用，也是在這勢利結合的現社會中不可少的做人的一大工具。特别是官塲之間更爲需要。故此體面之於任何人，猶如衣食，節省不得。且如能深悟個中奥妙，而善用之，則凖可以得到無窮的獲益。</p>

<p>— 設</p>
<p>當這農林經濟破產都市工商没落的不景氣時代，人皆感覺百事無可爲，比較還有些油水可撈的，恐怕要推做官一道了。</p>
<p>官的出息確乎大。幸而擠上了臺，明搶暗奪，千把幾百萬，不難一弄到手。等而下之，三五十萬也不在話下。昨日還是一個窮措大，明天立成暴富，嬌妻美妾，洋房汽車，儘够安富尊榮，享樂一輩子，所以現在一般人不惜卑躬屈節，婢膝奴顏，那怕鎭得滿頭是汗，猶死不肯放，還不是爲了官兒含有無窮的味兒嗎？</p>
<p>官是智識份子滿懷希望的唯一出路。「家無讀書種，官從何處來。」這説盡了父兄送使子弟求學的目的。這一傳統的封建思想，一直繼承到現在還在流行着。中國之所以糟到如此地步，雖然還有别種主要的原有以促成，却也不能不説是深中了這一遺毒，以致大家只望官道上爬，其他一切倒可不管。</p>
<p>爲了要做官，唯一的終南捷徑，是冠冕堂皇地頂着某種主義，以國事相號召。於是政治充當了做官的箭牌政權形成了爭奪的對象。以爭官爲導火綫，反映出種種政局的演變。他人投機取巧，一個一個登上了上峰，跌落在水裏的，不免眼熱心恨，調轉頭來，帶着自己門下敲鑼扛鼎的小卒，指住一些瘡疤，破口大駡，甚至不惜使盡所有的氣力，拚個　　　　　等到對方表示退步，自己　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　玩藝兒，至此一齊　旗息鼓，曾爲自己撑腰墊脚的，一脚踢開去，狐狸的原形現狀，一股腦兒顯露出來了。因爲分贓的不均衡，因爲前功的空勞無獲，據説當中樞某要上人初上臺時，便曾出演過好幾回全武行。這自是官海秘聞，外間鮮有得知者。</p>
<p>民國肇建以來，内戰連年未息，今日我討伐你，明日你打倒我，不知犧牲了若干性命，浪費了多少金錢，到底所爲何事，還不是爲了一二人欲遂官慾丨有了小官，更想大官，佔着苦缺，又要肥缺，誰覇據着不放，便打倒誰，二十年來的中國，便是在這爭奪擾攘的亂態中生息着。癥結所在，在乎官迷大多，官之頗爲味。</p>
<p>但是不久以前，報載一則這樣奇特的　　　　　　　　　三因感受刺激　深，失眠數月，神經錯亂，投江自殺。這眞是僅見的事實。小小縣官，誠然官之起碼者，卑卑不足道，可是做官竟致以刺激過深而落得如此悲慘的結局，不免使人有做官亦末路之嘆。而吾人且再追溯最近的史實，譬如沛縣等四縣？）的縣長，Ｘ至今仍繫在鎭江獄中，新疆主席金樹仁還在進行什麽上訴，江蘇民政廳長辜仁發官丢了將來不難重爲馮婦，但已受盡了社會的唾駡，而一塲訟案還不曾定讞。那做官又有什麽値得留戀呢！</p>
<p>不過以上所舉，或爲欺凌弱者敷衍門面的勾當，或爲帮帮不同互相傾軋的結果，這是官塲中難免的現象。所以有些人仍在拚命的鑽營，想弄個一官半職，這是寒不了一投官迷的熱誠的，是　見官　　全不可爲，　　　　　　　　耳。</p>

<h3>The Sino-Japanese Problem Revisited: League of Nations Faces Another Litmus Test. Advisory Committee to Meet Today, U.S. Representative to Attend. Certain Parties Attempt to Weaken the Non-Recognition Principle; Gu Weijun Determined to Offer Counsel to Uphold Resolutions.</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations' Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee will convene here on Monday, its first meeting in a year. It will discuss Japan's new policies towards China and the critical issue of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." Ostensibly, this special committee is convened to discuss postal relations with the puppet state. However, according to today's information, representatives from various countries intend to deliberate on significant Sino-Japanese issues, thus significantly increasing the importance of this meeting. Since the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued its declaration on Far Eastern policy on April 17, this is the League of Nations' first action. Today, responsible parties claimed that some committee members are actively attempting to diminish the strength of the non-recognition doctrine. However, this attempt will certainly be opposed by the United States, the only non-League member participating in the committee's work. It remains unclear as of this afternoon how certain parties will attack the non-recognition doctrine. However, reliable sources indicate that these individuals will seek to invalidate the legal and factual convention of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." Sunday's meeting was convened at the request of the British government because the puppet Manchukuo demanded that the British government pay postage fees for British mail passing through its territory. British diplomatic authorities fear that acknowledging this debt from the puppet state will be seen as undermining the principle of non-recognition. Therefore, they requested the committee to convene to resolve this matter. If Britain agrees to pay, it will undoubtedly provoke opposition from China. Although China is not a member of the committee, Chinese envoy to France, Gu Weijun, will, in his private capacity, advise the committee that such actions clearly violate the principle of non-recognition. It is widely believed that Mr. Gu will strive to strengthen the principle of non-recognition. (12th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources report that the League of Nations' Committee on Technical Cooperation with China convened in Geneva on the 14th. Our representative, Gu Weijun, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reporting that he departed from Paris for Geneva on the 12th. This League of Nations meeting is being held because Japan, which has withdrawn from the League, is resentful of technical cooperation. International parties will engage in substantive discussions to address its unreasonable behavior. Two days before the meeting, our diplomatic authorities sent a telegram to Gu Weijun, outlining the tasks entrusted to technical representative Rajchman after his arrival in China, strictly within the four areas determined by the League of Nations, and providing other instructions to prepare Mr. Gu for presentation to the Committee on Technical Cooperation.

<h3>Japanese Troops Recruit Chinese Laborers, Ignoring Our Obstruction</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A Japanese army unit is building a highway between Baimaguan and Gubeikou. The workers are recruited from various places in northern Hebei, each receiving 20 cents per day. They are closely supervised, and those attempting to escape are severely beaten. A total of 40,000 Chinese laborers have landed in Dalian in April. All of them are sought after by Japanese rogues and Chinese traitors who find ways to recruit them. After arriving in Dalian, they are transferred to Jilin and Heilongjiang to build highways and railroads. The Japanese Okura Consortium has contracted to repair the railways in Rehe Province. Due to a shortage of workers, they have sent people to Baoding, Ji County, and Qian'an in Hebei to recruit workers. For each recruitment of 200 people, the Sakata Automobile Consortium sends 20 vehicles to the vicinity of Gubeikou to transport them away. Our security team stationed in Miyun has tried to stop them several times, but the Japanese show their Kwantung Army passports and do not listen to our commands. (13th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Bandits Abandon the Blockhouse Policy</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Frontline reports indicate that the bandits, under our encirclement and suppression, had adopted a blockhouse policy.

Recently, the bandits have abandoned the blockhouse policy. Furthermore, the bandits believe that our blockhouses are densely distributed and impossible to break through. They have decided to engage us in all-out encounters in an attempt to achieve success. However, the bandits are short of both supplies and weapons. (13th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Anglo-Japanese Trade War Begins</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>British Secretary for Commerce Runciman recently stated in the House of Commons that he has consulted with the governments of various autonomous territories and colonies to adopt import quota measures, based on the average import volume from 1929 to 1931, to restrict the import of cotton products and artificial silk products into Britain and its territories. At the same time, it also announced the cancellation of the Anglo-Japanese West African trade agreement. The purpose of British import restrictions is, of course, to counter Japan. However, the dumping of Japanese goods in the British Empire is not limited to textiles, so there are proposals to expand the scope of restrictions.</p>
<p>The first to be affected by Britain's implementation of import quotas is Japan. Therefore, after the Tokyo Foreign Ministry learned of the British statement, it issued an informal statement. First, it clarified that Japan is not responsible for the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese commercial conference. Second, it believes that Runciman's statement damages years of Anglo-Japanese relations. Third, it cites the precedent of the French government protesting Britain's implementation of import quotas, deeply feeling that this British move violates the most-favored-nation clause. Fourth, it calls for Britain to consider the matter calmly and carefully, drawing its attention to the current robust state of Japanese industry, which is by no means comparable to that of ten years ago. The conclusion expresses that if Britain has sincerity, it is not difficult to make a final turnaround. Observing both sides' statements, Britain has not completely closed the door to negotiations, and Japan is particularly willing to negotiate with Britain. Therefore, although the confrontational situation is very tense, there seems to be an attitude of easing.</p>
<p>However, the fundamental opposition between Britain and Japan has been brewing for a long time and has deepened. Even if there is a temporary improvement, it is difficult to thoroughly reconcile. Japan's industry is gradually developing. Its cotton products are not only sufficient to cover the British goods market in the Yangtze River basin of our country, but also to further invade the South Seas Islands, India, Ceylon, and even Egypt and South Africa, causing the sphere of influence of the British Empire to be broken. The textile industries of Lancashire and Manchester are deeply uneasy. The deeply rooted English textile industry is fundamentally shaken. However, British industry and commerce have undergone a long period of struggle and training. In this emergency, how can they easily retreat? Furthermore, the development of Japanese industry is sufficient to support the militarism that specializes in aggression. The so-called magic hand of the East Asian Monroe Doctrine cannot help but extend west of Hong Kong, control the Malay Peninsula, and shake India. Japan's ambition to sweep across East Asia has been gradually exposed. Its powerful naval combat power is also tacitly recognized by the British. In order to maintain the safety of its territory and market, Britain cannot but follow economic sanctions with the expansion of military preparations. The construction of the Kowloon fortress, the rapid progress of the Singapore naval base, and the reorganization of the Australian and New Zealand fleets are all concrete demonstrations. Moreover, British diplomatic skills are extremely sophisticated. Alliance with the United States to resist Japan is the backbone of its Far Eastern policy. Although Anglo-Japanese relations will not break down in the short term, it can be asserted that they will change depending on the attitude of the United States. Today's Far Eastern situation is quite similar to the eve of the European War, with Japan and Germany being compared. It is also quite similar. Will we be Turkey? Or will we be Belgium?</p>

<h3>Xinjiang Construction Committee; Measures to Pacify Southern Xinjiang; Basic Principles Decided</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Xinjiang Construction Committee has decided on basic principles regarding various issues, including pacifying Southern Xinjiang and consolidating border defenses: 1. In terms of internal affairs, abolish the provincial system, separate military and civilian governance, move the provincial capital from Dihua to Yanqi, end military affairs, pacify Southern Xinjiang, disband the White Russian troops, stabilize local autonomy throughout Xinjiang, reward officials of all ranks in Xinjiang who bring their families with them to ensure they are at ease and remain in their posts for a long time, pacify refugees, and temporarily retain the Wang Gong system while encouraging them to voluntarily abolish it. 2. In terms of diplomacy, new Russian commercial agreements and new provincial local agreements that have not been recognized by the central government are all invalid. New Russian trade should be governed by treaties agreed upon by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Soviet Russia, and mutually respected. The trading bureaus set up by Russian merchants in violation of the agreement should all be suppressed. The residence and naturalization of foreigners in Xinjiang must be handled in accordance with international treaties. Foreigners residing in Xinjiang must abide by Chinese law. Foreigners seeking naturalization must submit an application according to law and obtain permission from the Ministry of Interior. Foreigners currently residing in Xinjiang or who have been naturalized must be investigated and handled in accordance with the law. (13th)</p>

<h3>Misunderstanding in the Jixian Incident Resolved; Yin Rugeng Reports on the Incident in Beiping; Matsui Visits Chaisan and Then Goes to Tianjin Together; Meeting with Yin to Discuss the Resolution of the Puppet Police Issue</h3>
<p>(Beiping) On the night of the 5th, more than ten large vehicles of Japanese troops transported military supplies from outside the Great Wall, passing through Jixian to Malanyu. Gunfire was heard along the way, and the Japanese troops suspected it was caused by our police force. Suddenly, on the 9th, two infantry companies originally stationed in Xinglongshan and Malanyu were sent to Xiaying, 40 li from Jixian city. Aircraft were dispatched to drop leaflets over Jixian, and the situation became tense. County magistrate Wu Minghao immediately reported the details to Yin Rugeng. After Yin repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese, Matsui, the chief of the Kwantung Army's special service agency stationed in Chengde, and Mabuchi, a staff officer of the 7th Division, came to Beiping on the 11th. On the morning of the 12th, they went to Jixian with Yin and met with the battalion commander of the Japanese army in Xiaying. It was then discovered that it was a misunderstanding. Both sides resolved the issue with drinks. It is reported that the Japanese troops stationed in Xiaying are scheduled to return to Malanyu on the 13th. Yin returned to Beiping today to report to the Beiping military and political authorities and will go to Tianjin tonight to report the incident to Yu. The issue of the withdrawal of the puppet state border police team from Gubeikou and Nantianmen has been delayed for two months because the other party demanded compensation for house repairs from our authorities. Matsui and Mabuchi, a staff officer of the Japanese 7th Division, passed through Beiping this afternoon to Tianjin and agreed with Yin Rugeng to discuss the resolution of the puppet police issue in Tianjin. After completing their business in Tianjin, Matsui and others will go to Yuguan to meet with Yi, and then return to Chengde by military aircraft from Yuguan. (13th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng returned to Beiping from Tongzhou this afternoon. Regarding the mobile militia in Yutian County, after the security teams of Jixian, Yutian, and Zunhua counties searched separately, more than 70 people who were willing to hand over their weapons and return to their hometowns to farm have already done so. The remaining members who do not heed the advice will be severely suppressed and eliminated soon. Yin plans to visit Yu in Tianjin within this week to report everything. (13th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Matsui, the chief of the Kwantung Army's special service agency stationed in Chengde, arrived in Beiping by car yesterday afternoon, accompanied by two attendants, to meet with Chaisan, the military attache of the Japanese embassy, for discussions.

<p>(Beiping) Chaisan, the military attache of the Japanese embassy, went to Tianjin this afternoon.

After explanation, there are no more problems. Chaisan's trip to Tianjin is to report everything to our provincial authorities. (13th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet police outside the south gate of Yuguan have recently intensified their security measures. The station conducts strict checks on passengers, and pedestrians are interrogated even more severely after 10 PM at night. Our police have not yet restored their armaments. After repeated negotiations between Su Yuqi, the chief of the Linyu Public Security Bureau, and the Japanese, the Japanese stated that no weapons may be carried east of Shimen. Su had come to Beiping and Tianjin to report to the authorities and, after returning to Linyu, negotiated with the Japanese again, but there has been no result. (13th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Puppet Regime Unofficially Announces Economic Control Policies</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet regime has unofficially announced the fundamental policies for Japanese-Manchukuo economic control: Japan and Manchukuo should form an economic unit due to the necessity of resources and industrial affairs. Based on this principle, three fundamental policies are decided: 1. The integration of the Japanese-Manchukuo economy as a single entity is the most rationalized; 2. Secure the livelihoods of the Japanese and Manchukuo people during both peacetime and wartime; 3. Increase the capacity for external economic warfare. Regarding the core issues of Japanese-Manchukuo economic control, both sides have also decided on three items: 1. Base on the interests of the entire Japanese-Manchukuo, and strive to avoid bias in benefits; 2. Establish Japanese-Manchukuo national defense economics; 3. Take the lead in foreign countries in fostering Japanese economic power in Manchuria to guide the Manchurian economy of backward countries. (13th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Implementation Date of the Household Registration Law; From July 1st of This Year</h3>

<h3>Li Shaogeng, Puppet Supervisor of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Dismissed</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Shaogeng, the puppet supervisor of the Chinese Eastern Railway, was dismissed because last month, the Japanese instigated treacherous people to surround the board of directors and request a reduction in freight rates, insulting Russian dignitaries. The Russian side protested seriously, and the Japanese side softened, so he was dismissed and replaced by Shen Ruilin, the puppet minister of internal affairs. (13th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Northeast Volunteer Army Is Active; The Japanese Side Imposes Severe Oppression</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese side has no way to pursue the Jilin-Heilongjiang Volunteer Army because each army has broken up into smaller units, adopting a small-team activity strategy, which has been quite effective. If the Japanese army attacks with a small number of troops, they surround and annihilate them; if they attack with a large number of troops, they retreat into the mountains and forests. Therefore, the Harbin-Suifenhe and Harbin-Manzhouli railway lines are often areas where the Volunteer Army operates. The Japanese side is oppressing the people of Northeast China even more severely. Special service agencies and military police teams hire many Chinese traitors to act as spies, investigating the actions of their acquaintances, earning one yuan per day and submitting a report every seven days. A clerk named Li from the Binjiang City Chamber of Commerce was arrested by the Japanese military police team in Harbin for receiving a letter from a friend from the Shanghai Party Department after someone informed on him, and his legs were broken. Therefore, people who have a glimmer of hope are trying to escape into the pass. (13th Special Telegram)</p>

Ambassador Hishikari stationed in the puppet state consulted on policies towards Manchuria. The results of the conference are as follows: (1) The judicial power in the puppet organization is already in the hands of the Japanese, and most judges are gradually being replaced by Japanese. Therefore, extraterritorial jurisdiction must be abolished early. In addition to the various legal conveniences, its effect can also foster the spirit of Japanese-Manchukuo unity. (2) The return of the administrative power of the South Manchuria Railway affiliated land to the puppet state does not mean the abandonment of administrative rights and interests, but rather the expansion of administrative power to the entire Manchuria. Therefore, there is no objection. (2nd Hualian Telegram)</p>

<h3>Disarmament Shows Signs of Collapse; Britain Prepares to Expand Air Force to At Least Twice Its Current Combat Strength; Germany Demands Military Equipment, Feeling Threatened</h3>
<p>(London) The British Air Force will soon be expanded to twice its current combat strength, as the disarmament conference is almost certainly doomed. Britain's expansion of its air force is inevitable. Even moderate members of the Labour Party are unwilling for the British Air Force to be relegated to fifth or sixth place. The British people, who have always regarded their island nation as a land of peace, are suddenly aware that the English Channel is not enough to rely on, and they fear aerial attacks. Government officials, media tycoons, writers, and politicians have repeatedly lamented the weakness of the British Air Force. General Groves recently recounted that during the European War, Germany dropped approximately 300 tons of bombs on British soil. However, today the enemy could drop at least twice that tonnage within 24 hours of the start of a war, and the continued bombing could be endless. Britain also feels that air attacks cannot be defended against. It is said that during the European War, less than 5% of German Air Force planes were lost.</p>
<p>The British people were initially uneasy when they learned that Britain had only 850 first-line military aircraft and 1,650 naval and military aircraft. They are well aware that France has 3,000 fighter planes, Russia has 2,800, the United States has 2,800, Italy has 1,800, and Japan has 1,937. The reason why the British want to catch up quickly is that the German Aviation Minister Goering recently spoke with British reporters, stating that Germany demands an air force equal to 30 to 40 percent of the combined air forces of its neighboring countries. It is believed that Goering intends to add 1,000 to 1,250 military aircraft. Officials here have privately told Associated Press reporters that the cabinet is now concerned about Germany's future air force strength, not the superior air forces of France or Soviet Russia. The London Stock Exchange, a barometer of the current situation, has predicted that the British Air Force will soon expand. The soaring prices of British aircraft company stocks have made it almost impossible to obtain dividends. When the disarmament conference first showed signs of collapse in early October last year, aviation stocks gradually rose in price. Some stocks rose from 22 shillings to 27 shillings in a single day, and some stocks with a face value of only five shillings jumped to 16 or 18 shillings. Since Lord Rothermere and his Daily Mail and Sunday Dispatch advocated for improving air defenses, most of British public opinion has followed suit. Rothermere initially demanded a fourfold expansion of the air force, and later suggested that Britain should have 20,000 military aircraft. Government newspapers, although more moderate, have also joined this propaganda. The new air force budget for 1934-1935 is only 527,000 pounds more than the previous budget, but it is possible that this budget will be supplemented later this year. It is said that only if foreign countries implement air force disarmament can Britain's plan to expand its air force be canceled. This is indeed difficult. Recently, Baldwin, representing the government, stated clearly in Parliament that if the disarmament conference fails, Britain will compete with foreign air forces within attack range to an equal extent. The realization of this matter should not be far off. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Germany Promotes Aviation; Aviation Week Set for June 1st to 8th; Team Flying Competitions to Be Held</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German government has now designated June 1st to 8th as Aviation Week. During this time, the whole country will promote aviation sports, flying competitions will be held at flying fields across the country, and funds will be raised for the German Aviation Association. June 3rd will be designated as Aviation Day. The Zeppelin airship will fly across the country for two days, making the situation even more exciting. The annual German flying competition will still be held at the end of June, with participants competing in team flying instead of individual flying. The final event of this year's aviation sports will be the participation of excellent teams in the all-European flying event. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to statistics published by the Department of Commerce, Germany's purchases of aviation materials from the United States are increasing. In March of this year (the month covered by the statistics), Germany purchased 47 aircraft engines from the United States, worth $249,480. In the first three months of 1934, Germany purchased a total of 122 aircraft engines from the United States, compared to only 47 in the entire year of 1933. In the first three months of 1934, Germany purchased two aircraft for model use, multiple engines, and many accompanying parts, sufficient for the installation of hundreds of aircraft, totaling $900,780. In the entire year of 1933, this expenditure was only $349,090. More than one-third of the aviation materials exported by the United States are absorbed by Germany, making Germany a good customer of the United States. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>German Disarmament Envoy Returns to Berlin</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Chancellor Hitler previously sent General Ribbentrop as a special disarmament envoy to Britain to discuss disarmament matters. He has now completed his mission and returned to Berlin from London last night. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German disarmament envoy General Ribbentrop, carrying instructions to visit London, met with British Foreign Secretary Simon. It is said that Ribbentrop was instructed to present new German proposals on disarmament to the British government, including Germany's return to Geneva (i.e., rejoining the League of Nations and the disarmament conference). The Essen Rheinisch-Westfälische Zeitung recently published news from Berlin, denying the above statement, with wording seemingly authorized by the government. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>New French Seaplane; Ascends 2,000 Feet in Just Nine Seconds</h3>
<p>The aircraft manufacturer Bréguet in Le Havre has built a new three-engine all-metal seaplane named "Algerie", which will be used to fly to Saigon. This aircraft will soon fly to Saint-Raphaël in the south for the final official tests. Today, Bréguet invited aviation personnel to ride it once. The new seaplane ascended into the air in 20 seconds, and after nine minutes, it had ascended to a height of 2,000 meters. It can carry 19 passengers and three crew members. Fully loaded, with enough gasoline for 1,000 kilometers of flight, it weighs 13 and a half tons. The average speed is 180 to 190 kilometers per hour. Another aircraft of the same type is still under construction. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>American Aviator to Fly Across the North Pacific; Japan Pays Close Attention to the Results</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The United States Navy dispatched warships and aircraft to Alaska and the Aleutian Islands in early May to investigate naval and air bases. Two more teams will be sent to investigate this summer. The Japanese Navy is very nervous about this. Yesterday, the Navy received intelligence that six U.S. Navy flying boats plan to fly from the Pacific coast to the Aleutian Islands for long-distance non-stop exercises. The Naval Ministry is paying close attention to the results of this exercise in order to prepare for the North Pacific. (China United Press Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Sudden News Circulating in London; MacDonald Shows Signs of Fatigue; Will Resign as Prime Minister Next Month; To Dedicate Himself to Writing</h3>
<p>(London) The Sunday Express carried a strange news story this morning, stating that Prime Minister MacDonald intends to resign from all his positions at the beginning of next month. This news was published on the front page of the newspaper. According to the newspaper's political reporter, he has received reliable information that Prime Minister MacDonald has decided to resign on June 5th, the fifth anniversary of his cabinet formation. It is said that this news is unquestionable and comes from government officials, confirmed by Lord President Baldwin. The report continued that MacDonald showed signs of fatigue last October when he celebrated his 67th birthday, so that younger generations could succeed him. Therefore, MacDonald's reason for resigning is not due to political issues, but to indicate that Britain has safely overcome its national difficulties. MacDonald has written extensively on political and social issues, and it is said that after his retirement, he will continue to dedicate himself to writing. MacDonald's famous works include "Socialism and Society," "Labour and Empire," "The Awakening of India," and "The Socialist Movement." (National News Agency Telegram, 13th)</p>

<h3>Hostility Between Hungary and Yugoslavia; Border Conflicts Occur Frequently; Hungary Requests League of Nations to Investigate the Truth</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Over the years, incidents have occurred along the border between Hungary and Yugoslavia, resulting in the deaths of 15 Hungarians. Recently, the Hungarian government has requested the League of Nations Council to organize an international commission of inquiry to investigate the truth of the matter and determine responsibility. This request has been placed on the provisional agenda for the next Council meeting. People at the League of Nations are speculating as to why the Hungarian government, which had no such intention before, suddenly made this request. Those directly related in Yugoslavia are taking a very calm attitude, saying that the Yugoslav side still has some incidents that have been tolerated until now, and the circumstances are even more serious than those raised by Hungary. If Hungary asks the League of Nations to investigate, then Yugoslavia can also publicize its unspoken matters to the world. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Hungarian government applied to the League of Nations to investigate the border incidents between Yugoslavia and Hungary, claiming that these incidents are sufficient to affect European peace. The document submitted by the Hungarian government to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol is 25 pages long, listing border disputes over the past three years and stating that Hungary has tried its best to minimize them. However, it now feels that the League of Nations must intervene. Hungarian Prime Minister and Minister of War Gömbös hopes that the League of Nations will appoint a special committee to investigate the border disputes between the two countries and decide on measures to prevent future disputes. He also hopes that the committee will go to Hungary to verify the incidents mentioned in the document, and said that Hungary's request is not intended to sensationalize, because there is no imminent threat of war. However, the League of Nations Council must pay attention to the current situation. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Chaco Dispute; League of Nations Investigation Report; Recommends Cutting Off Arms Supplies</h3>
<p>(London) The report of the committee sent by the League of Nations to investigate the dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia was released today. It stated that European and American countries are now supplying the two warring factions with the latest weapons, all of which cannot be manufactured by the two countries themselves. To resolve the dispute between the two countries, the only hope is for the League of Nations, the United States, and other South American countries to cooperate closely to cut off the supply of arms, and then this cruel war can be ended. Now, wounded soldiers in both countries are spreading infectious diseases everywhere, and young people are dying in droves. This kind of war is truly a great disaster for the civilized world in that part of America. The dispute between the two countries over the Chaco forest area has been going on for nearly a century. The old case was brought up again in 1928, and they took up arms against each other. Although the United States and other South American countries mediated, it was not successful. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)</p>

<h3>Most Japanese Soldiers are from Farming and Laboring Classes; Proletarians Account for 70% of the Total; Military Urgently Seeks to Resolve the Livelihood Problems of Workers and Peasants</h3>
<p>According to a survey by the Japanese military, reported by the China United Press Tokyo correspondent, farmers make up the largest number of Japanese young men subject to military service inspection, accounting for 34% of the total. Industrial workers account for 27%, and children of merchants account for 17%. The remaining 22% are made up of others. Those so-called industrialists and merchants subject to inspection are all proletarians. This shows that 78% of the Japanese army is from proletarian backgrounds. The reason why the Japanese military advocates that domestic workers' and peasants' unrest must be resolved before external wars is here.</p>

<h3>Australia-Japan Trade Issues; A Rough Accord Reached in Preliminary Talks Between Latham and Hirota; Japanese Representative to Simla Conference Returns Home</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota and Foreign Minister Latham met, and they have reached a consensus on opinions regarding Australia-Japan trade. Specific matters will be handled by the Director of the Japanese Trade Bureau, Kuraishi, who is visiting Japan, and the Australian economic representative, Mackie, as well as the Consul-General stationed in Australia, Murai, and the Australian government simultaneously negotiating. Currently, the Japanese business community hopes that the Australian government will reduce tariffs on Japanese goods and implement a system for allocating Japan-Australia imports and exports based on the Batavia principle. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also decided to take this popular hope as the fundamental guideline and negotiate with Australia. (Japan United Press Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>The Japanese representative to the Japan-India trade talks, Sawada, arrived in Nagasaki yesterday afternoon aboard the Shanghai Maru. He told reporters that the Indian government's tariff protection law imposed harsh taxes on Japanese goods, but in fact it had been withdrawn, which can be said to be a success. It is necessary for exporters to control exports after the treaty is implemented. He negotiated on the tariffs on groceries and asked them to be reduced, but some were actually increased, which is regrettable. Although the tariffs on rayon fabrics remain unchanged, India's policy is to protect tariffs and fiscal tariffs in parallel, so attention must be paid. (Dentsu Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Balkan Great Unity; Foreign Ministers of Romania and Turkey Hold Important Talks; A Second New Treaty Will Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>Last night in Bucharest, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, at a banquet honoring Turkish Foreign Minister Tevfik Rüştü Aras, made an important speech, stating that the Balkan Peninsula countries will soon establish a second Balkan treaty, and that the new treaty will be even more important than the first treaty. The purpose of the Turkish Foreign Minister's visit here is to discuss issues of the Balkan Peninsula with the Romanian authorities, such as the new situation after Yugoslavia and Bulgaria signed a non-aggression treaty, and Yugoslavia's refusal to ratify the treaty due to Bulgaria's non-joining of the Balkan treaty. During the meeting, Titulescu also stated that the close ties between Turkey, Greece, and Soviet Russia, like the Romanian Little Entente and the union of Poland and other countries, are sufficient to create a group of small countries and are of great benefit to future lasting peace. Aras, after Titulescu's speech, rose to reply, and its main idea was also to express the hope that Bulgaria would soon join the Balkan treaty group. Political circles here believe that the foreign ministers of the two countries will soon be able to find a suitable way for Bulgaria to join. A treaty system such as non-aggression treaties between two or three countries is also one of the methods, and can avoid Bulgaria's difficulty in recognizing the territorial status quo.

<h3>U.S. Special Envoy Meets with Italian Prime Minister to Discuss Economic Issues; Italy Opposes Reopening the World Economic Conference; Criticizes the U.S. for Unfair Treatment of War Debt Countries</h3>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt's special envoy, Child, met with Prime Minister Mussolini tonight to discuss all important economic and financial issues. The two discussed Roosevelt's fiscal policy and Italy's gold standard and monetary stabilization policies. The Prime Minister said that Italy built two ships for Poland, and Poland paid for them with coal. Child also discussed economic relations between Italy and the United States with Mussolini, planning to transport Italian wine to the United States and import American kerosene to Italy in exchange. Regarding the issue of war debts, Mussolini said that Italy pays a portion of its debts to the United States whenever they are due, to show that it does not deny the debts. Its actions are the same as those of the United Kingdom, but the United States now treats Italy and the United Kingdom the same as other countries that do not pay their debts at all. Italian public opinion is deeply puzzled by this. Regarding the reopening of the London Economic Conference, Italy clearly expressed its opposition. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>Italy, Austria, and Hungary Sign Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>Rome Since Italy, Austria, and Hungary signed a political and economic protocol on March 17 of this year, experts from the three countries began discussing the details of the economic agreement here on April 5. This agreement can be signed tonight. According to this agreement, Austria will purchase Hungarian wheat, paying 52 lira per quintal, and Italy will purchase Hungarian wheat, paying 56 lira per quintal, both at the price when delivered at the Hungarian border. This figure is twice as high as the usual market price in Hungary, but lower than that in Italy, because the wheat price in Italy is usually between 83 and 110 lira per quintal. More than 50 kinds of Austrian goods enjoy preferential tax rates. In addition, Italy will separately establish treaties with Austria and Hungary for the ports of Trieste and Fiume.

Those who oppose the government all thought that an accident might occur at the Radical Party Congress, which would be unfavorable to the government, but they did not expect the result to be so good. All right-wing, centrist, and center-left newspapers expressed happiness with the fact that the Radical Socialist Party Congress unanimously supported the Doumergue government due to the persuasion of party leader Herriot.

<h3>US Notifies Debtor Nations: Existing War Debts Will Still Be Treated as Credit Payments; Unwilling to Invoke Johnson Act</h3>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today that the government is unwilling to invoke the Johnson Act to consider future credit payments as defaulting nations. According to reliable sources, the State Department has informally notified diplomatic representatives of debtor nations that if they continue to make credit payments on war debts due in June, the US government is unwilling to automatically list them as defaulting nations. It is said that the State Department is willing to accept these payments without mentioning the status of the debtor nations. If the debtor nations request clarification of their status, then the State Department will invoke the Johnson Act to declare the nation in default. It is also said that the State Department has notified diplomatic representatives of various debtor nations that default itself is not a problem, but if the debtor nations wish to borrow money from the United States, then the US government will invoke the Johnson Act. It is reported that this matter was decided at a White House meeting attended by President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Attorney General Cummings. (National Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Gains Support; Silver Faction Will Ultimately Yield</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Democratic congressmen assured the President that they would do their utmost to eliminate the dissent of the silver faction, thereby greatly solidifying President Roosevelt's position in dealing with the silver issue. Some observers stated today that the silver faction has actually obtained concessions from the government that are far less than what they demanded. Well-informed sources all believe that the silver faction has failed to subdue the President, so they will ultimately be forced to yield to the will of the government. It is also heard that Congress may pass a silver bill unfavorable to the President, but the President also has the right to veto it. If Congress wishes to override the veto, it requires a two-thirds majority in a joint session of both houses to pass. (National Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to opinions here today, President Roosevelt's silver plan is now close to the views of silver faction congressmen. It seems certain that silver legislation can be established during the current congressional term. There is agreement between both sides that silver should be used as a national currency reserve, with gold accounting for 75% and silver accounting for at least 21%. The issue that still needs to be resolved is whether there should be a direct mandatory command, or whether it should be implemented at the President's discretion. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Serious Dockworkers' Strike on US Pacific Coast; Strikers Clash with Police; Governor of Washington Initiates Mediation Conference</h3>
<p>(New York) The strike of 15,000 longshoremen on the Pacific coast took a dramatic turn today. Clashes occurred at various ports between strikers and non-union workers and police. The most intense of these occurred at the Galveston port in Texas, where strikers engaged in fierce fighting with security forces protecting ships. As a result, one striker was killed and one was injured, and three members of the security force were arrested and charged with murder. In San Francisco, dockworkers and non-union workers exchanged gunfire, fortunately without causing injuries. Strikers beat five African Americans and overturned and destroyed a car. However, a large number of police arrived, and the unrest subsided. Governor Meier of Washington State is now considering the request of shipping companies to dispatch troops to maintain order. Today, rioting by strikers occurred at the port of Portland, hence the shipping companies' request. Portland shipping companies recruited non-union workers to continue working, and had them temporarily reside in some ships, using them as river hostels, so as to avoid being obstructed by strikers when traveling in the streets. However, this morning, 400 strikers swarmed to a ship temporarily used as a worker dormitory, causing a major disturbance. Police boarded the ship to drive them away. Some were thrown into the river, and others were beaten, but the policemen who fell into the water were rescued. After this incident, Governor Meier immediately received a request from the mayor of Portland and others to send troops to suppress the situation. Meier eventually decided to convene a peace conference and has summoned Ryan, the president of the longshoremen's union, to San Francisco to ensure that representatives of both the strikers and the shipping companies peacefully resolve their dispute. This labor dispute broke out four days ago with the aim of getting employers to accept their demands to reduce working hours and increase wages. The situation is now becoming increasingly serious, and additional police have been dispatched to patrol various ports. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Naval Department Sends Letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Thank the British Naval Authorities</h3>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Weihui Telegram to all newspapers: The water from the mechanized steam box of this factory is discharged into the Nanfangcheng River or the Beifangwei River, and there have been no differences for more than ten years. Recently, a few troublemakers falsely accused us in the Jixian Court of harming hygiene and damaging the road. In fact, the water does not contain toxic substances, and no danger has occurred on the road. The judge of the court did not investigate the facts in the past, did not test the water quality, did not study the principles of the machine, and did not allow the water to be discharged on both the north and south sides. He also violated the law by changing the predetermined date of sentencing to mediation after the debate was concluded. The prosecutor refused to allow it according to law, and then delayed for more than 20 days, renewing the procedure for public debate. On that day, only the prosecutor was invited to court, and the defense lawyer was not notified to attend, ignoring the interests of the defendant. The next day, it was ruled that the manager was sentenced to six months in prison for inciting workers to discharge water, and it was also said that continuing to discharge water would be considered continued crime. Such abuse of the power of law destroys industry and creates an unprecedented bad precedent. There are many factories across the country that discharge water into rivers. If this is not disputed, everyone will be at risk. It is not just a matter of one factory. Now, if this factory does not discharge water, it cannot operate. We had no choice but to temporarily stop work and appeal to seek justice in accordance with the resolution of the board of directors. We specially send a telegram to ask for support to uphold justice. We look forward to your support. Weihui Huaxin Yarn Factory respectfully.</p>
<h3>Xiamen's Various Circles Oppose the Sale of Land to Swire Trading Company, Establishing a Zhou Xingnan Opposition Committee, and Opposing the Sale of Land to Japanese Nationals</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, May 5th. After the Siming County Party Department convened a memorial meeting for the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, a temporary motion was made to organize the "Siming County Groups Opposing Zhou Xingnan's Unauthorized Sale of National Territory and Investigating the Accounting of Past Road Construction Officials Committee." Fifteen groups were selected as members. Two key points were resolved in the resolution: (1) Zhou Xingnan, the director of the Xiamen Municipal Works Bureau, colluded with Yang Decong to sell official property behind Liaozi to the British-owned Swire Trading Company to build warehouses and wharves, obtaining more than 500,000 yuan. The case was deemed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as insulting to power and harming the country, forfeiting territory, and strictly ordered to be stopped, but Zhou refused to comply. (2) Zhou also sold land near the Hulishan Fort area in Maohou, Heshan, to the Xiamen Nan Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company, organized by Japanese national Lin Tumou. It was resolved to request the Central National Government and the Provincial Government to swiftly punish Zhou Xingnan and Yang Decong, and to cancel the contracts between Zhou and Swire Trading Company and Xiamen Nan Company. After the meeting, a telegram was immediately sent to the Central Government and the Provincial Government in the name of the meeting, requesting that Swire Trading Company be ordered to stop the construction of warehouses and wharves, and to investigate Zhou's past road construction and relief projects. The progress of Xiamen's municipal administration, the opening of roads, the construction of markets, and the new embankment park area began in the fifteenth year of the Republic. The leading agencies were initially the Municipal Administration Supervision Office and the Municipal Council, later changed to the Road Administration Office of the Naval Zhangxia Garrison Headquarters. The person responsible for administration was Lin Guogeng, the former Garrison Commander and current Fortress Commander. However, in reality, Zhou Xingnan was in charge for nine years. Zhou initially served as the Road Administration Office Manager, then as an advisor, and Lin trusted him extremely. All municipal plans and facilities came from Zhou, and Lin only gave his approval. The most noteworthy proposal of the anti-Zhou meeting was the Swire Trading Company wharf and warehouse matter. It originated from Swire Trading Company's forceful construction of a trestle bridge on the Haihoutan in the ninth year of the Republic, which once aroused strong opposition from the citizens, boycotting British goods. The Haihoutan where the Swire warehouse and wharf were located was appropriately located north of the newly opened Zhongshan Road entrance, obtaining its land lease rights in the Xiamen British Concession. Later, when the British Concession was recovered, the lease rights continued. After Zhongshan Road was completed, the Swire warehouse still occupied the road entrance and was not demolished. After the embankment was completed, the Swire trestle bridge and lighters still existed. Therefore, its warehouse and wharf greatly hindered land and water transportation. Zhou Xingnan was supposed to negotiate to order them to move. As a result, the newly reclaimed land of Tongwen Road embankment behind Liaozi was sold to Swire. The land originally belonged to overseas Chinese Yang Decong and was transferred back to the Road Administration Office for sale to Swire. The method of sale was a perpetual lease contract, signed on a certain day and month in the twentieth year of the Republic, with a rent (i.e., land price) of 500,000 yuan, of which the Road Administration Office received 100,000 yuan and Yang Decong received 400,000 yuan. This kind of perpetual lease is equivalent to a complete sale. Siming County magistrates Yang Tingshu and Qiu Rui both had official seals, and the Road Administration Authority, the landowner, and Swire all had signatures. The most important content was: (1) After the land is perpetually leased to Swire Trading Company, Swire Trading Company has the right to build wharves and warehouses on the land. (2) 430 zhang of land and 100 zhang of sea land. Based on these two points, Swire can not only freely build warehouses and wharves and their necessary buildings within the 430 zhang land area, but also berth lighters and build trestle bridges or water wharves within 100 zhang of our territorial waters. After the establishment of this contract, Swire immediately started construction of the wharf on the land. The matter was known to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreigners are not allowed to purchase land or have disguised perpetual lease rights in our territory. In July and August last year, Liu Guangqian, the Diplomatic Treaty Commissioner stationed in Xiamen, was instructed to negotiate with the British Consul to revoke the original contract, and at the same time ordered Swire to stop work. The provincial government also ordered the Siming Municipal Preparatory Office to negotiate with the British Consul to revoke it. After repeated inquiries, in March of this year, the Municipal Preparatory Office finally raised the negotiation with the British Consul Marting stationed in Xiamen. The British Consul has not yet formally replied, only verbally expressing the reasons, saying that the land lease does not violate international conventions, and there is a price of 500,000 yuan, and the construction cost has also used 500,000 yuan. The contract can be modified, and revocation is impossible. After the establishment of the Anti-Zhou Association, Zhou Xingnan issued a notice to defend himself, saying that "The Swire wharf was originally at the entrance of Zhongshan Road, and the goods were piled up, hindering traffic. The lighters spanned, hindering shipping. The warehouses were not demolished, hindering the road alignment. The Zhongshan wharf could not be built, and the embankment landscape could not be beautiful. For the above reasons, it was necessary to order the relocation. However, the trading company has obtained the original rights for many years. It is not permitted by the facts to cancel it unconditionally. There is no other way except to exchange the wharf for the wharf and the land for the land. Therefore, there is a designation to move to the head of Tongwen Road. This is not what the trading company is happy to comply with. It is really the strong will of the Embankment Engineering Office. The conditions may need to be modified, but the handling is not inappropriate. The association does not blame the loss of power in the late Qing Dynasty, but blames Xingnan for insulting the country, which is putting the cart before the horse." This is the Swire incident in the problem. As for the sale of land in Maohou, Heshan, the people of Heshan strongly opposed Zhou Xingnan's defense last year, saying that Xiamen Nan is a company organization, not a Taiwanese, and Lin Tuben is only one of the shareholders. The Anti-Zhou Association is equally fierce about this, considering the area near Hulishan Fort a national defense area, with tens of thousands of acres of land falling into the hands of Japanese nationals, so it is considered extremely serious.

<h3>The Supervisory Yuan's Contribution to the Draft Constitution (Continued) Regarding the Supervisory Power</h3>
<p>(6) The President, Vice-President, and members of the Supervisory Yuan should all be appointed. The term of office of the Supervisory Yuan members should be set as life or more than ten years. (Explanation) The President and Vice-President of the Supervisory Yuan are elected by the Supervisory Yuan members themselves. This kind of regulation is not only not found in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, but also contrary to Dr. Sun's teachings. In the sixth chapter of Sun Wen's theory, it is clearly advocated that the President of the Supervisory Yuan should be appointed by the President with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. Because the Supervisory Yuan and the Legislative Yuan are fundamentally different in nature, the Legislative Yuan is a collegial body, while the Supervisory Yuan exercises its powers independently by the Supervisory Yuan members, and is by no means a collegial body. It is inappropriate to imitate the example of the collegial body and order them to elect their own President. The production of Supervisory Yuan members is stipulated to be elected by the National Assembly, which is especially contrary to the independent spirit of Supervisory Yuan members. Because the Supervisory Yuan members are law enforcement officials who mainly exercise their functions independently, their actions must be independent and their status must be transcendent. The exercise of their impeachment power should be based on the law and not on political backgrounds. The laws of various countries all strive to make judicial officials independent of political relations, because the status of judicial officials is mainly transcendent and independent, and they must be completely insulated from political operations in order to enforce the law like a mountain and stand firm. Supervisory Yuan members are the judicial officials of public officials throughout the country. If they are made to rely on political forces, they will have to go with political forces. In the future, the result will not be to make the Supervisory Yuan members completely become politicians, but to make politicians become Supervisory Yuan members. Once the Supervisory Yuan members fall into the political vortex, they will inevitably use the power of impeachment as a tool for political struggle. How can the independence of the Supervisory Power and the dignity of the law be maintained? The judicial officials of the United States have always been elected by the people. The result of the experiment is that there are many abuses, and they have to resolutely abandon it. Now our country is creating a new system, but it does not hesitate to pick up the old laws that others have abandoned and use them. How can the political future be imagined? As for the length of the term of office of the Supervisory Yuan members, it is closely related to the exercise of their powers. Consolidating their position is to protect their freedom. If they are frequently re-elected, the weak will inevitably advance and retreat and remain silent, and the cunning will use their powers to cater to the psychology of the voters. Justice and fairness have long been put aside. Therefore, in order to protect the freedom and independence of the Supervisory Yuan members, their term of office should be extended and their position should be consolidated. Except for being subject to criminal punishment or disciplinary dismissal, their term of office should be set as life, or at least more than ten years.</p>
<p>(7) The powers of impeachment and auditing should be exercised uniformly by the central government. The powers of impeachment and recall should be distinguished. (Explanation) The powers of impeachment and auditing should be exercised uniformly by the central government. This has already been explained in detail in the second item. Now, it will be briefly stated. What is valued in local autonomy is the development of the people's ability to govern themselves and their interest in public affairs. Therefore, the powers of deciding policies (legislation) and implementing policies (administration) are mostly granted to local governments. After the policy is decided and put into practice, to prevent it from being biased or misusing public funds, and to achieve the greatest results with the most economical methods, it is the responsibility of the central government that is in charge of the overall situation that should not be abandoned. Therefore, the judicial system of various countries is not regarded as a local matter, and the auditing and supervision of subordinate officials for violations of law and dereliction of duty are also exercised by the administrative organs of the central government. In this initial draft of the constitution, since the power of the judiciary has not been given to the local government, the powers of impeachment and auditing should also be exercised uniformly by the central government, and should not be replaced by the county and city councils of the local legislative organs. In the initial draft of the constitution, the boundaries between impeachment and recall are very vague. For example, in the second item of Article 96, "When the Legislative Yuan is dissatisfied with the response of the Executive Yuan to inquiries, it may propose a motion of no confidence with the resolution of more than two-thirds of the members present." As for how the Supervisory Yuan proposes an impeachment case, there is no clear provision. Article 147 stipulates that "When the County Magistrate violates the law or derelicts his duty, the County Councilors may propose an impeachment case with the resolution of three-quarters and request the county residents to recall him." The proposal to ask the National Committee to recall the Executive Yuan in the Legislative Yuan is called a motion of no confidence. The proposal to ask the county residents to recall the County Magistrate in the County Council is called an impeachment case. In terms of the nature of the two cases, what is the fundamental difference? It is very confusing. In European countries that adopt a cabinet system, once a motion of no confidence in the parliament is passed, the cabinet is naturally dissolved except for the President to dissolve the parliament. What is the role of the motion of no confidence in the charter? If the motion is rejected by the committee and the Legislative Yuan is not naturally dissolved, then the legislative and administrative authorities will not be able to help each other in the future. Therefore, the colleagues believe that the boundaries between the power of impeachment and the power of recall should be clarified. The object of impeachment should be limited to violations of law and dereliction of duty, and should not be concerned with the appropriateness of the policy or whether its administration is satisfactory. The power of recall should include the merits and demerits of the policy, the efficiency of the administration, and violations of law and dereliction of duty. The power of impeachment should be exercised independently, and the power of recall must be established with the approval of more than half of those with political power. Therefore, the scope of the power of recall exercised by county and city residents should be limited to purely county legislation and county administration. When public officials in each county and city execute laws and regulations on behalf of the central government and the people are dissatisfied, they should only appeal or petition to the competent superior authorities, and must not directly recall them to avoid disputes between the central government and local governments.</p>
<p>(8) The audit report of the audit agency should be submitted to the National Assembly for final decision. (Explanation) The national budget bill and final accounts bill are all decided by the parliament in countries with separation of powers. The parliament is the organ representing the people, and the people should have the power to supervise the state's revenue and expenditure. Now, the initial draft of the constitution stipulates that the budget bill is resolved by the Legislative Yuan, and the final accounts bill is reviewed and decided by the Supervisory Yuan (Article 125). Both houses are not organs that directly represent public opinion, and they exercise this power, which is obviously a servant who exercises the power of governance, infringing on the political power of the whole people. Therefore, the colleagues believe that the initial compilation and review of the budget bill may be exercised by other organs, and the power of final decision must belong to the National Assembly. Westerners say that those who hold the money bag will control everything, and that there is no taxation without representatives. This is because the administration of a country is affected by the economy everywhere, and the appropriateness of the income and expenditure of a country, and the burden of the people, are transferred accordingly. Therefore, the National Assembly, which represents the whole people, must have the power to supervise the budget and final accounts related to the national economy. Therefore, the colleagues advocate that the final accounts report should be submitted to the National Assembly for final decision and then published. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province: The Depression of Commerce in Jiangbei, The Bankruptcy of the Rural Economy, and The Sharp Increase in The Number of Unemployed</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence. The counties of Huai, Xu, Hai, and Yang in Jiangbei have convenient transportation and have always been known for their prosperous commerce. In recent years, due to the mutual torment of natural and man-made disasters, financial stagnation, and economic difficulties for the people, commerce is on the verge of collapse. Forced closures are common, and the number of unemployed workers has increased sharply. The depression is unprecedented in recent years. The recent commercial conditions in various counties in Jiangbei are recorded as follows: (1) Money Industry. There are no less than 300 money shops in various counties in Jiangbei, with a capital of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan for large shops and more than 10,000 yuan for small shops. The turnover of silver and money directly depends on Zhenjiang and indirectly depends on Shanghai. Since the collapse of large money shops such as Jinsheng Hengtai and Yuanyi Zhengbai in Zhenjiang at the end of last year due to business failures, the source of economic resources has suddenly been lacking, resulting in unprecedented panic. It is also difficult to pay for withdrawals from depositors. Only 40% of the shops listed this spring. The financial situation is extremely tight and has reached its extreme. In the past, transactions were calculated in terms of guiyuan and keyang, which were very different. Since the implementation of abolishing taels and replacing them with yuan, the money industry has suffered a major loss. As for foreign shops, the price of grain is currently about the same everywhere, and the transportation cost is huge and bandits are rampant, almost stopping operations. (2) Grocery. Jiangbei groceries are centered on Xuzhou, Jiangdu, Nantong Huaiyin, and other counties, with a larger scope. Other counties are slightly inferior. The business method of this industry is to wholesale goods from various factories and shops in the country and resell them to customers, or to copy and send them to small shops in various towns and villages for wholesale purchase. After the four northeastern provinces were swallowed by the violent sun, all parts of the country banned Japanese goods, and this industry was also affected. Moreover, most of the goods in this industry are daily necessities for the people, and the prosperity of the business depends entirely on the purchasing power of the people. In this autumn of economic bankruptcy for the people, the trade of this industry has been severely hit. (3) Silk and Cloth. The silk produced in various counties in Jiangnan sells for about one million yuan a year in Jiangbei. After foreign habutai silk was dumped in China, the business gradually failed. The silk shops in various counties suffered heavy losses. In March of this spring, they had discussed methods and tried to improve the situation in order to recover. However, during this spring famine period, the business has not improved. As for cloth, because the market is currently flooded with foreign goods, domestic cloth has fallen behind. Although customers are attracted by large sales, the result is still disappointing. In total, there are about 620 silk and cloth shops in Jiangbei, and most of them are losing money. (4) Rice Industry. Gaobao and Xingtai counties in Jiangbei are rich in rice, which is relied on to supply the food for the thirty-four counties. The rice price was more than ten yuan per picul in the previous year, and due to rice merchants hoarding and speculating, the rice price once rose to twenty yuan. In the past two years, due to the good harvest in various counties, the price has repeatedly fallen and has not risen to this day. The best is currently about six yuan per picul, and the second best is about five yuan. According to a rice merchant, the recent rice price has fallen, and the profit is minimal. It is now heard that a large amount of rice will be trafficked from the counties under the Li River, so the rice price may tend to rise in the near future. (5) Gold and Silver. Gold and silver are luxury businesses. Recently, the social financial situation is tight and the people's purchasing power is weak, and business is declining day by day. Although the new metric system of 8536 discount weighing has been realized and the gold price has fallen, the business has not been active. Currently, the most common business is cashing, but the profit is very small. Recently, most of the industry has changed its course and made exquisite silver shields and other exhibits to adjust. (6) Others. Other industries, such as the tobacco and alcohol industry, are also mostly depressed. The hotel industry has suffered a tragic decline in business due to the decline of various industries. Due to the erratic weather this spring, there are many people suffering from epidemics, so the western medicine industry is slightly better than other industries. The tea and food industry is deserted. The bankruptcy of the peasant economy can be seen from this. (13th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Farmers in Xiaokunshan are Robbed and Extorted</h3>
<p>Li Fen, a villager in Qianjinggang Township, Xiaokunshan, is over sixty years old and cultivates more than 30 mu of rented land. Due to years of famine, his family is getting poorer and poorer. His son, He Yun, was surprised to see a small boat coming from the port on the night of the 10th, carrying eight robbers. They spoke the local dialect, all wearing short clothes and carrying four guns. They broke into Li Fen's house. The father and son had already fallen asleep. They were startled and threatened by the robbers, not allowing them to make a sound. They entered the room and searched frantically, but there was nothing of value. Unable to satisfy their desires, the robbers tied up He Yun and forced the victim to prepare 500 yuan on the spot as a ransom. However, it was impossible for poor farmers in the wilderness to raise such a huge amount of money immediately. After pleading repeatedly, they managed to collect 68 yuan from various families in the whole village and offered it to the robbers. Although He Yun was released, the robbers still instructed the victim to make up the shortfall and pay it in Shanghai. At dawn, the robbers abandoned the boat and fled on foot. The farmers are still uneasy to this day.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Conflict Between Party Members and Patrol Police</h3>
<p>All Patrol Officers of the First Sub-Bureau Strike</p>
<p>At about 8:00 p.m. on the 11th, a party member and five or six friends, after drinking, accidentally broke a small stove held by a pedestrian while walking through Siqian Street, causing a quarrel. After mediation by nearby shops, they were persuaded to pay compensation and the matter was settled. However, the onlookers still did not disperse. Chen Luyun, the No. 30 patrol officer stationed at the Meikou of the Shuyuan, saw this and rushed to disperse the crowd. Unexpectedly, Zhong Zong, a cadre of the County Party Department, grabbed the patrol officer and accused him of dereliction of duty. Zhong's friends tore the officer's uniform. Then, Zhong and his group of five or six people dragged the patrol officer to the Public Security Bureau to report to the Director. Director Yin immediately asked Section Chief Sun Jinzhang to meet on his behalf. Unexpectedly, Sun did not distinguish right from wrong and saluted the party members and severely reprimanded the patrol officer on the spot. When the police officers of the Public Security First Sub-Bureau (where Patrol Officer Chen belonged) heard the news, they thought that the patrol officer was being insulted at will and went to the Bureau to await a fair judgment. Unexpectedly, they learned that Section Chief Sun had made such a judgment. The police officers were in an uproar, thinking that the patrol officers had no protection. They returned to the First Sub-Bureau and, after a meeting, decided to strike immediately and planned to send representatives to petition the party and government organs. The incident was learned by the precinct inspector, who rushed back from the Bureau, summoned the police officers, and gave them a speech, emphasizing the importance of the local area and not being negative. After two hours, they resumed their posts. The incident was learned by the Supervisory Committee of the Party Department, which immediately sent people to investigate overnight. The police department is preparing to make a statement the next day, and it is heard that there are some differences of opinion between the supervisory committee and the executive committee of the Party Department regarding this incident.</p>
<h3>Robbery in a Farmer's Home in Xiaohudian</h3>
<p>At about 2:00 a.m. on the night of the 10th, the home of a farmer in Xiaohudian outside the South Gate was suddenly robbed by more than ten bandits. Lu Xingxian heard the noise and escaped to the roof. His wife was suddenly tied up and beaten, causing injuries. Then, they began to plunder, looting more than fifty yuan in cash and ornaments such as gold rings and gold bracelets, worth about one hundred yuan. Lu's wife is now seriously injured and has been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Employee of a Foreign Firm Flees with Embezzled Funds</h3>
<p>Li Yunqing, a native of Zhoujing Lane in the Second District of the town, used to be a rent collector in the real estate department of the Ma Hai Foreign Firm in Shanghai, earning a lot of money. However, he liked to wander around and squander money recklessly. By the time of the Lunar New Year last year, he had embezzled about 6,000 yuan in rent, which he could not make up for. He abandoned his job and fled back to Wuxi, hiding in the countryside. Later, his brother-in-law, Lu Gaoyong, sent people to search for him everywhere, but failed to find him. He then hired lawyer Chao Jimei to file a complaint with the Shanghai Local Court and offered a reward of 500 yuan for his arrest. On the 28th day of the third month of the Lunar calendar, the various temples in the city held grand events. Li Yunxiang came to the city to watch the events. He was spotted by his fellow villager Ni Shangzhi in front of the Shengquan Garden in Chongan Temple. Because he had a heavy reward, he reported to the patrol officer Zeng Xiangyun, who arrested Li and took him to the First Sub-Bureau of Public Security. Commissioner Qin held a preliminary trial. According to his confession, he embezzled more than 6,000 yuan from the Ma Hai Foreign Firm in Shanghai, which he did not deny. Yesterday, he was sent to the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. At the same time, Ni Shangzhi reported to the Shanghai Chao Jimei Law Firm by long-distance telephone. After receiving the report, Lawyer Chao specially sent a representative, accompanied by the plaintiff Lu Gaoyong and Li's sister, to Wuxi. They identified Li at the Public Security Bureau without error. Lu Gaoyong returned to Shanghai that night and reported to the Shanghai Local Court, requesting that the police be sent to Wuxi to escort him back for trial.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Six People Drowned in a Capsized Straw Boat</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 12th) at about 5:00 p.m., there were seventeen men and women on a straw boat from Jiangbei at Jiaoshan Port. Due to the small boat and the large number of people, it ran aground on a shoal. After the boatman tried his best to row out, the rudder was damaged. Suddenly, the water was tight and the current was rapid, and it was impossible to support. It capsized in the heart of the river, and everyone went into the water. Nearby fishing boats saw this and bravely went forward to rescue them. As a result, eleven people were rescued, and the other six could not be found. It is feared that they have been buried in the belly of the fish.</p>
<h3>Recent Status of the Liutang River Project</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department believes that the Liutang River project is related to navigation in several counties. Since the construction of the river began, it is necessary to understand the extent to which the project has progressed. Therefore, it specially sent Xiao Tongying, the section chief of the First Section of the Department, and Ge Hanlou, a technician from the Jiangbei River Engineering Bureau, to inspect the project. Mr. Xiao has now returned to the province after completing his official duties. According to him, the dykes that have been completed are in Siyang, Suqian, and Huaiyin counties. As for the dykes in Guanyun, Donghai, Lianshui, and Shuyang counties, they have been completed over 95%. The main task now is to open the river. Therefore, more than 30,000 workers are currently engaged in this work, and 50% of the river has been opened. If it does not rain, there is hope of completing it within this month.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Coastal Bandits Have Been Repelled</h3>
<p>Large groups of Haizhou gang bandits have been harassing the coastal areas of Jiangbei and extorting fishermen. Later, the provincial government dispatched the maritime patrol team to suppress them on the Juejuo Sea, killing many bandits. The bandit ships have fled north.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Spring Cocoons to Be Marketed Soon</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, this year's spring cocoons will be marketed soon. However, the price of cocoons is not optimistic due to the accumulation of stored silk. According to sources in the silk industry, the price of spring cocoons is feared to be only about 200 yuan per unit. Furthermore, the Silk Improvement Association of the Economic Commission will establish a joint Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk factory to help the silk industry. The information obtained is as follows:</p>
<h3>Varying Conditions of Spring Silkworms</h3>
<p>According to reports, the spring silkworms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are not in good condition due to the unstable weather. The performance of the native early silkworms is not satisfactory. However, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have distributed more than one million sheets of improved seeds to various model areas such as Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Jintan, Hangxian, Fuyang, and Xiaoshan. Because the development is relatively late, and the instructors used scientific methods to provide popular guidance, the results are excellent. During the third molt period, the silkworms are still strong. The harvest is expected to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Cocoon Prices Unlikely to Rise</h3>
<p>The spring cocoon market will be launched around the 20th. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have already implemented cocoon collection control, and cocoon merchants are very willing to cooperate. However, because many silk factories have suspended work, the price is expected to not rise excessively. According to people in the cocoon industry, the price of cocoons this spring is feared to not exceed 200 yuan, which is only about 20 cents per catty.</p>
<h3>Joint Silk Factory to Be Established</h3>
<p>The Silk Improvement Association, witnessing the crisis in the silk industry, believes that if measures are not taken to help, the future will be unthinkable. Therefore, after several discussions by various committees, it was decided to establish a joint Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk factory, gathering all the silk reeling factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces under unified management. However, this</p>
<h3>Four Departments, Including the Ministry of Communications and the Municipal Government, Agreed to Dredge the Wusong River; Total Budgeted Expenditure of Over Two Million; Construction to Begin After the National Economic Commission Allocates Funds; Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture Will Benefit After the Project Is Completed</h3>
<p>The Wusong River runs across Shanghai and Jiangsu, controlling the hub of inland waterway tributaries. However, due to years of neglect in dredging, the river channel has become silted up. Although there was a dredging plan, it was not completed due to insufficient funds. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Communications believe that the river is a vital waterway, with great impact on commercial transportation and agricultural irrigation. They specifically consulted with the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government to hold a meeting in Beijing the other day, deciding on the dredging plan and the total project expenditure, scheduled to be completed within six years. The funds will be allocated after consulting with the National Economic Commission, and construction can begin. The following are the details explored and reported by the Dagong News Agency reporter:</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached Through Consultation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Communications, considering the long-term silting of the Wusong River, which is inconvenient for both agriculture and commerce, specifically planned to find ways to dredge the river to benefit transportation. However, this river has close ties with the local government. On the other day (i.e., the 12th of this month), they consulted with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and other agencies in Beijing to discuss the dredging plan and determine the funding. After discussion, it was decided to dredge the Wusong River, with funding set at 2.14 million yuan, to be borrowed from the National Economic Commission. In the future, it will be repaid by a surcharge on land tax and by various water conservancy agencies. It is scheduled to be completed in six years. The funds will be allocated after being approved by the standing committee, and construction will begin.</p>
<h3>Dredging Plan</h3>
<p>The dredging plan for the Wusong River was previously drafted by the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau and the Shanghai Junpu Bureau, and it was quite detailed. After the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau was reorganized into the Taihu Water Conservancy Association, directly under the Ministry of Communications, the previous plan is still applicable and has not been changed slightly. The entire project content of the dredging plan is as follows: (1) The section from Xugong Port to Fanhuangdu is the most silted and narrow. This section is approximately 59 kilometers long. (2) The section of Yejidun is curved and prone to silting. It is planned to straighten the curve and dig a new river. (3) The section from Guajing River to Jianghe Village needs to deepen the riverbed. (4) The section from Fanhuangdu to Waibaidu Bridge is a must-pass route for ships and should be dredged urgently. The total amount of earthwork for all the above projects is estimated at 550,000 cubic meters of solid earth. The earthwork for straightening the curve and digging a new river at Yejidun is estimated at 170,000 cubic meters. After the dredging is completed in the future, agricultural irrigation and commercial shipping along the river will greatly benefit.</p>
<h3>Budget Estimate</h3>
<p>The planned project of dredging the Wusong River is very large, and the budgeted expenditure and distribution are as follows: Land acquisition cost 66,750 yuan, total cost of earthwork 1,515,460 yuan, administrative expenses 120,000 yuan, it is planned to purchase three dredgers at a total cost of 310,000 yuan, two tugboats at a total cost of 50,000 yuan, equipment expenses 10,000 yuan, reserve fund 67,790 yuan, totaling 2.14 million yuan.</p>
<p>This matter is quite difficult to start. According to a survey, of the more than 400 silk reeling factories in Jiangsu Province, only a dozen or so are operating. If relief is to be sought, a huge amount of capital is needed. It is heard that this matter is currently being planned, and at the latest by next spring, all factories can be unified under the Joint Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Factory.</p>
<h3>Forty-Five Cigarette Factories Present Tax Reform Opinions Again</h3>
<p>Since the Legislative Yuan selected Wei Tingsheng to come to Shanghai to investigate the actual situation of cigarette tax reform, the current two-tier system has been generally recognized as needing improvement. Forty-five local domestic cigarette factories, including Minzhong, Fuxin, and Nanyang, jointly presented to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating their opinions for improvement. The text reads:</p>
<p>To state the opinions on cigarette tax reform and request adoption: We have found that the current two-tier cigarette tax system is unfair to Chinese and foreign companies, and unfair to upper and lower grade cigarettes. Twenty-four cigarette companies, including Minzhong, have successively appealed for improvement. Now that the Legislative Yuan has selected Committee Member Wei Tingsheng to come to Shanghai to conduct on-site investigations and collect opinions from all parties, we are deeply grateful for his concern for the people's livelihood. According to the conversation of the Committee Member Wei, based on the current tax rate, the tax rate on the lowest-priced cigarettes is ten times higher than the tax rate on the highest-priced cigarettes. He sees the root cause of the unfairness of the current tax system. In recent years, Chinese merchants have closed down one after another, and those who barely survive are also heavily in debt. The tobacco farmers in Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces are even more restricted to the Gan industry. All of this is due to this. Now that it has been exposed in one word, it is no wonder that the cigarette industry colleagues are so grateful and even laugh and cry. Committee Member Wei advocates ad valorem taxation, reversing unfairness into fairness, which is truly a good medicine for the cigarette industry to revive. However, the road is one foot high, the devil is ten feet high, and resistance is inevitable. At this time when the Legislative Yuan is seeking public opinion, matters related to the vital interests of merchants should be detailed and stated, so that they may be adopted. (1) Tax reform should focus on alleviating the unfairness of the unified rate, and should not be used as an opportunity to raise funds. In recent years, the economic downturn has spread to our country, and all industries have withered. The cigarette industry can hardly be unique. The Tax Affairs Department is the competent authority for cigarette tax and knows this deeply. According to the Tax Affairs Bulletin, Volume 1, Issue 6, the minutes of the fifth executive meeting of the Tax Affairs Design Committee on the case of Tan Shiyi's proposal for tobacco supervision and sales measures, it was resolved, "This year's tax increase is only 27% higher than last year's average tax rate, and sales have decreased by more than 20% compared to last year. Light tax increase already has this situation. If it is doubled again, the sales will be drastically reduced." It is clear from the resolution of the Tax Affairs Design Committee that the cigarette industry cannot bear heavy taxes. In the autumn of last year, former Director Xie, representing former Minister Song, convened a meeting of Chinese and foreign cigarette merchants, declaring that the tax would not be increased within one year, which is further conclusive evidence that the cigarette industry cannot bear heavy taxes. The sincerity of former Minister Song and former Director Xie in caring for cigarette merchants is also seen by the people. In the winter of last year, Minister Kong had to increase taxes because of the urgent need for funds for construction and bandit suppression. The cigarette merchants suffered even more, and began to request tax reform. The so-called tax reform is to change unfairness into fairness, that is, ad valorem taxation. If the tax revenue of the previous year was no more than 50 million yuan, and the government's hope for this year is no more than 72 million yuan, then this tax reform should take 72 million yuan as the standard. Committee Member Wei said that if ad valorem taxation is adopted, estimated at 50% of the value, there should be an income of more than 80 million yuan. It can be seen that the previous request of forty cigarette companies, including Minzhong, to change to a seven-tier tax, the so-called 52.5% ad valorem tax revenue, will definitely have a surplus and not a deficit, and is definitely not empty talk. This tax reform should still take the annual revenue of 72 million yuan as the standard. Indeed, 50% ad valorem is already 8 million yuan more than the government's hope for this year. Even with a broad budget, there should be a considerable limit. Since the cigarette industry cannot bear heavy taxes, the government has already clearly seen it. The source of tax revenue should be properly cultivated to avoid exhausting the pond to catch the fish. If the suffering of cigarette merchants is not considered, and the name of improving the unfair tax rate is used to increase taxes in reality, our people-loving Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Finance will definitely not do this. (2) Wu Tingsheng's so-called 100% ad valorem is a personal opinion and is greatly opposed to the consensus of the cigarette industry colleagues, and is not enough to represent the association. Check the letter from twenty-eight cigarette companies, including Minzhong, to the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Industry Association on March 22. If any government agency seeks the association's opinion on cigarette tax rates or convenes a meeting for discussion, please convene a members' meeting in accordance with Article 17 of the association's charter, publicly discuss it, and elect representatives from the meeting to jointly negotiate with the government in order to benefit both the country and the people. In addition, no one shall, without the resolution of the meeting, reply to any government agency in the name of the association, which would violate public opinion. The total number of members of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Industry Association is no more than fifty, so twenty-eight has passed the majority. Therefore, Wu Tingsheng's proposal can only be said to be a personal proposal and is not enough to represent the association. (3) Wu Tingsheng's so-called box number should be calculated at 70% after tax reform has no basis. Before the three-tier tax, the sales of cigarettes increased by 10% every year. After the change to two tiers, the number of boxes began to decrease. Now, if it is changed to ad valorem taxation, it will be fairer than the seven-tier tax, and the number of boxes will naturally increase. Moreover, it is well known that private cigarettes sell about 20,000 boxes per month. In the future, after using flower wrapping and banning cigarette paper machines, private cigarettes will be completely eliminated. The cigarette factory can expect an additional 20,000 boxes of business per month, and the government can also expect an additional 20,000 boxes of tax revenue per month. That is to say, there is hope for a two-fold increase in the number of boxes after tax reform. Why should it be calculated at 70%? Its lack of foundation is unbelievable and is obvious to all. (4) The two theories that 100% ad valorem and 80 yuan are the lowest tax rate cannot be changed, and both are sufficient to hinder the progress of tax reform and must be handled. Check the two major drawbacks of the current two-tier tax: First, the tax on low-end cigarettes is too heavy. Second, the tax on high-end cigarettes is too light. The merchants have repeatedly stated this in their documents, and their voices are exhausted. They bear a heavy tax of 150% ad valorem, while high-priced high-end cigarettes only bear a light tax of 13% ad valorem. The true beneficiaries of the two-tier tax are only British and American companies and a few large cigarette companies. The government's tax revenue is in surplus in one place and in deficit in another. The government has not benefited from the heavy tax on low-end cigarettes. Therefore, if the government truly wants to have sufficient tax revenue, it must adopt ad valorem taxation and abolish the special benefits for high-end cigarettes. Committee Member Wei's so-called ad valorem tax, estimated at 50% of the value, can generate 80 million yuan in annual revenue, which is clear evidence. As for the two theories that 100% ad valorem and 80 yuan are the lowest tax rate cannot be changed, the tax rate is too high, which is definitely not something that cigarette merchants can bear. The state should also consider market conditions when setting tax rates, and must not exhaust the pond to catch the fish and disregard the cigarette industry. If these two theories are implemented, they will only arouse the opposition of all cigarette merchants, directly hinder the progress of tax reform, indirectly prolong the life of the unfair tax rate, will not benefit tax revenue, and will be a fatal injury to the cigarette industry. Our wise government should be able to see the advantages and disadvantages and not be swayed. (5) Please reserve the right to re-levy tax refunds. Check unified tax goods, after one tax, can be circulated throughout the country, and no other taxes or levies shall be collected. If re-levy is encountered, evidence of re-levy shall be held to apply for a tax refund to the original collection agency, which is a good principle of unified tax. Since the establishment of the Unified Cigarette Tax Office in the 17th year of the Republic of China, cigarette merchants have never been affected by the military affairs in various provinces, and have relied on this to bear double tax burdens. This is why former Minister Song and former Director Xie were deeply grateful to the unified tax merchants, and the unified tax has become a major source of national treasury revenue. At a time when domestic politics have not yet been fully on track, it is especially appropriate to retain this to provide security. (6) Please reserve the right to tax refunds for moldy cigarettes. If cigarettes become moldy, the factory goods will not only have no business profits to be made, but also the capital will be wiped out. Appropriate tax refunds should be given to avoid increasing the burden on merchants. Moreover, the competition between Chinese and foreign cigarette industries is the most intense. The drying equipment and vacuuming machines of British and American companies are more complete. If the tax refunds for moldy cigarettes are not refunded, the British and American companies will have an advantage, which is also not the way to protect domestic industries. (7) The evaluation is not as good as the quoted price without any malpractice. The price of cigarettes is the most difficult to identify. If the evaluation belongs to the committee members, the staff can manipulate it at will, and there will be endless malpractices. It seems better to follow the intention of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's land price reporting, and the manufacturer is responsible for reporting and registering the price. At the same time, a standard for freight and wholesale price should be set. In addition to freight, the price should not exceed the registered price. Violators will be punished. Manufacturers are neither willing to report more to increase the burden of taxes, nor can they report less to reduce the income of the wholesale price. It seems to be more complete than evaluation. All seven of these are very important to the future of tax reform, and are also greatly related to the interests of the cigarette industry. The merchants have consulted with each other and have the same opinions. It is appropriate to jointly submit a request for review and approval, and please adopt and implement it, which will be convenient for all.

<h3>Residents of Peideli Continued to Petition Cai Ning Yesterday; More Than 500 Men and Women Swarmed to Xujiahui; Dean Yao Received Them and Promised a Reply Within Three Days</h3>
<p>Since Peideli on Xinzha Road was cut off from water for the second time by the water company at the request of the owner, six representatives, including Liu Chengyong, had petitioned Archbishop Cai Ning the day before, but were not granted an audience and therefore had no results. A plenary meeting of the residents decided to hold a large-scale petition to Archbishop Cai again. They went for the second time at 8:00 AM yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Second Petition</h3>
<p>The full body of representatives in the area convened a general meeting at 8:00 PM the previous evening, deciding to send representatives to the Xujiahui Cathedral to make a second petition to Archbishop Cai Ning. Yesterday morning, eight trucks were chartered from the moving company, carrying more than 500 male and female residents, including Wang Jieqing, Liu Chengyong, Chen Silong, Yuan Nansheng, Jin Meirong, Leng Bingnan, and Huang Yaozu. Amidst the sound of firecrackers, they departed in an orderly fashion, heading straight for the Xujiahui Cathedral to petition Archbishop Cai Ning.</p>
<h3>Requesting Police Protection</h3>
<p>More than 500 male and female residents arrived at the Xujiahui Cathedral around 9:00 AM and lined up to advance towards the church. The church had already received a phone report from the Peideli priest, and had already received the news. Therefore, it immediately requested protection from the police authorities. The local Public Security Bureau and others sent more than 40 policemen to be stationed and protect to prevent unexpected events. However, the male and female residents were all intellectuals and were quite able to strictly observe order, so no accidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Representatives Received</h3>
<p>When the more than 500 male and female residents got off the bus, they shouted slogans such as "Welcome Archbishop Cai Ning to save people with the Lord," "We have been without water for sixteen days, please help and uphold justice," "Adding water fees is a disguised rent increase, we do not recognize it." After shouting the slogans, they asked to see the church. Afterwards, since yesterday was the last day, the church followed the usual prayer Mass ceremony and welcomed Archbishop Cai, which only ended at 9:45 AM. Then, Leng Bingnan, Wang Jieqing, and the proxy lawyer Wang Xiangu, three representatives publicly recommended by more than 500 residents, entered the church and requested a meeting with Archbishop Cai. However, Archbishop Cai refused and still commissioned Dean Yao of the church to receive them. The representatives then stated the suffering after the water cut-off and requested that the Rental Department be instructed to order the water company to turn on the water to save the current crisis.</p>
<h3>Satisfactory Reply</h3>
<p>According to Dean Yao, the church was completely unaware of the Peideli water cut-off before. The church learned about it only when the representatives petitioned the Archbishop yesterday. All the church's real estate is managed by Bishop Hui with full authority. He has previously conveyed this intention to Bishop Hui for handling, and there will be a satisfactory reply within three days. Therefore, I hope everyone will wait patiently and not be impatient. The representatives felt satisfied and returned.</p>
<h3>Central Mint Expansion Is Being Planned; Minting of Decimal Subsidiary Coins Is Inevitable; The New Coin of the 23rd Year Has Been Issued and Circulated</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the mold for the new coin of the 23rd year of the Republic of China was casted on the 7th of this month. The minted new coins have been reviewed by the Review Committee since May 8th in accordance with the review regulations. All new coins that pass the inspection will be sent to the Central Bank for issuance and circulation in the market. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Qiao Fusan, the secretary of the Review Committee. According to the conversation, the expansion of the Central Mint is being planned. The minting of decimal subsidiary coins is inevitable. However, it will be studied and decided after the establishment of the Currency System Research Committee of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>The New Director of the Postal Administration, Guo Xinsong, Will Come to Shanghai to Take Office; Acting Director Tang Baoshu Is Preparing to Hand Over</h3>
<p>Huang Naishu, the director of the Postal Administration, was transferred to the director of the Postal Department, and the vacancy was filled by Guo Xinsong, the counselor of the Ministry of Communications. It was approved by the last Executive Yuan meeting. It is now known that Guo Xinsong has been ordered by the Executive Yuan to take office in Shanghai within a few days. The acting director Tang Baoshu is preparing to handle the handover. The original order of the Executive Yuan is as follows: "It is hereby decided by the 159th meeting of this Yuan to transfer Huang Naishu, the director of the Postal Administration, to the director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications, and the vacancy of the director of the Postal Administration is filled by Guo Xinsong, the counselor of the Ministry of Communications.

<h3>Chen Shaokuan and Others Arrived in Beijing</h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, Zeng Zhongming, Zou Lin, and Chu Minyi took the overnight express train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Yang Dezhao Postpones His Return to Guangdong; Will Go to Beijing to Attend the Financial Conference</h3>
<p>Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang in Beijing, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. Yang was originally scheduled to return to Guangdong within a few days. Now, because the National Financial Conference has been scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 21st of this month, financial authorities of all provinces and cities will arrive in Beijing to attend. District Fangpu, the director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance, cannot attend due to other engagements, so Yang will represent him to attend as he is nearby. Therefore, the date of returning to Guangdong has been postponed. He will return to Guangdong and visit Chen Jitang after attending this meeting to report on the situation in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Wang Luyi, Representative of the Central Government, Persuades Yang Hu to Stay</h3>
<p>Yang Hu, the director of the Shanghai Security Office and the preparatory committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, has resigned from the preparatory committee to the Standing Committee of the Central Government due to the heavy burden of his duties. The Central Committee has appointed Wang Luyi, the director of the Civil Movement Association, as a representative to persuade him to stay. It was reported yesterday that Wang Luyi had arrived in Shanghai. According to reliable sources, Yang is still in Hangzhou for official business and can return to Shanghai on the 15th. Wang is currently in Beijing and will personally meet with Yang after Yang leaves Hangzhou and returns to Shanghai to represent the central government and sincerely persuade him to stay.</p>
<h3>After the Closure of British and American Old Factories, the Labor Union Appeals for Party and Government Rescue</h3>
<p>The British and American Tobacco Factory in Pudong has repeatedly reduced its workforce within the past month. It once received Municipal Government Order No. 30, stipulating that the work week should be 40 hours, and no further reductions should be made without government approval. However, before long, the factory reduced the work week to 36 hours without applying for government approval. The labor union then petitioned the party and government agencies, and received Social Bureau Order No. 3614, which said that the petition had been received and forwarded to the municipal government for approval, and ordered the factory to postpone implementation. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of this month, the factory posted a notice suddenly announcing the closure of the old factory and ordering employees to enter the factory to settle workers' wages. The old factory had a total of about 3,000 male and female workers. Because it was Saturday, they were all at home and unaware of the news. Upon hearing the news, the labor union believed that the factory should have applied to the party and government agencies for approval before closing the factory, and the labor union had not been notified. The sudden closure of the factory was unexpected. It immediately convened an emergency board meeting to discuss the measures and request urgent treatment. Fearing that all the workers would have an accident, it issued an emergency notice to inform the workers to wait quietly for the party and government to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Reduction of Fresh Mulberry Leaf Transportation Costs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Transportation Departments, in order to maintain sericulture, have determined that all fresh mulberry leaves transported on these two railway lines are the only feed for silkworms. The transportation fee was previously reduced from second class to third class. Now, in order to facilitate and support the silk industry, the transportation fee will be reclassified as fifth-class goods. The aforementioned measure will be implemented from May 15th. All stations have been specifically notified to comply.</p>
<h3>Li Du Arrives in Shanghai to Aid Northeastern Refugees; Young and Strong to Settle in Suiyuan; Women and Children to Leave Shanghai Immediately</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the Shanghai Northeastern Refugee Relief Association still has a group of families of anti-Japanese generals and displaced Northeastern compatriots in dire need of assistance. On the 12th, General Li Du came to Shanghai from Suzhou specifically for this matter. It is reported that as a result of the discussions, some young and strong individuals will follow Zhu Jiqing to Suiyuan to engage in cultivation work. The remaining women and children have been arranged for separately by General Li Du and will be able to leave Shanghai in the shortest possible time to avoid further displacement. According to Mr. Li, he will also be leaving within the week and that his trip to Shanghai was solely to help the Northeastern refugees, with no other mission.</p>

<h3>Seawall Construction to Begin</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan seawall project has been actively underway since its approval by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Construction is scheduled to begin in sections on the 21st of this month. Peng Yumo, the director of the engineering office, is currently inspecting Baoshan, Taicang, Songjiang, and other counties to determine the areas that need repair in order to establish the construction sequence. The provincial government will also send personnel to supervise the project at that time.</p>
<h3>Crew Members Serving Beyond Their Rank; Ministry of Communications Strictly Orders Crackdown; Qualified Captains and Engineers Already in Oversupply</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications considers that the practice of crew members serving beyond their rank is prohibited by the Crew Certificate Regulations, but many shipping companies have failed to comply, often leading to danger, while qualified crew members are being idled without employment opportunities. The Ministry of Communications yesterday received a report from the Shanghai Maritime Administration stating that among the ships operating on coastal, near-sea, and river routes in Shanghai, totaling over one thousand tons but less than three thousand tons, the captains and engineers were originally filled by crew members holding certificates one grade lower. It was asked whether they could be temporarily allowed to continue serving as usual. Based on this, the Ministry has ordered the bureau to crack down. The original order is recorded as follows: “It is extremely clear in Article 5 of the Interim Crew Certificate Regulations that crew members holding certificates must not serve in positions one grade higher. This regulation has been in effect for one year and eight months, but various shipping companies have not complied, and the bureau has also failed to crack down, which is quite wrong. Furthermore, according to investigations, approximately two hundred and fifty-four crew members nationwide have received Grade A and B captain's certificates from this Ministry since July of the 17th year of the Republic, and approximately two hundred and forty have received Grade A and B engineer's certificates. In comparison, there are only over one hundred and thirty ships nationwide that are over one thousand tons but less than three thousand tons, and only over twenty that are over three thousand tons. The supply already exceeds the demand, so what difficulty is there in replacing them? Moreover, recently, there have been frequent cases of accidents caused by chief officers acting as captains without proper qualifications. The existing regulations and repeated orders should be strictly followed in handling this matter. However, the claim that an immediate crackdown would cause companies to be unable to hire suitable crew members in a rush, perhaps leading to a suspension of services, is also a real concern. All crew members of Dalu and other ships who are approaching their upgrade deadline may apply for certification as quickly as possible and be allowed to serve. By the end of June, the companies should still be strictly ordered to replace all other crew members who do not hold appropriate certificates in order to maintain the law and ensure safety. You are hereby informed of this order.”</p>
<h3>Zhifengyong and Yidayong Two Gold Shops Declare Liquidation; Lawyers Entrusted to Handle Debts; Both Lost Money Trading Futures and Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that after the closure of the Shanghai head office and Nanjing branch of the Oriental Trust Company, the Zhifengyong and Yidayong gold shops simultaneously declared liquidation. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Zhifengyong</h3>
<p>Zhifengyong Gold Shop, with a capital of 30,000 yuan, managed by Tian Derun (also a director of the Oriental Trust Company), located at Weiqing Lane, Tianjin Road, engaged in futures and bill trading, lost over 400,000 yuan and declared liquidation on the 9th of this month. A liquidation notice was posted at the entrance, stating: “Qiu Fenling, attorney, representing Tian Derun of Zhifengyong Gold Shop, hereby announces: I have received a statement from Tian Derun, owner of Zhifengyong Gold Shop, stating that the shop is experiencing financial difficulties and has entrusted me with liquidation. All creditors and debtors are hereby notified to register with this law firm within fourteen days. This announcement is made for general information."</p>
<h3>Yidayong</h3>
<p>Yidayong Gold Shop, with a capital of 36,000 yuan, managed by Zou Junqing (also a supervisor of the Oriental Trust Company), located at Yongqing Lane, Ningbo Road, engaged in futures trading, lost over 100,000 yuan, which could not be recovered. It declared liquidation on the 9th of this month. A notice from the Tongren Law Firm stated: "According to the application of Zou Junqing, manager of Yidayong Gold Shop, the shop is experiencing financial difficulties and is unable to continue operating. We have been entrusted to represent the liquidation. All creditors of the shop are hereby notified to register with our firm within fourteen days, and all debtors of the shop are also required to pay off their debts in full within fourteen days in order to resolve the disputes. Failure to comply within the deadline will result in legal action. This announcement is made."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Revision of Match Trademark Paper Tax Rate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating: (abbreviated salutation) "According to a letter from the Shanghai Color Printing Trade Association on the 10th of this month, Article 551 of the newly revised Customs Tariff issued by the Ministry of Finance on May 22nd of last year stipulates that the tax rate for box paper (used for making matchboxes) is 5% ad valorem. Article 552 stipulates that the tax rate for white or dyed glazed paper (foreign wove), wholly or mainly made of machine-made wood pulp, is 3.3 Customs Gold Units per picul, equivalent to 15% ad valorem. The Jianghai Customs requires that matchbox paper without match trademarks printed on it be taxed according to Article 552, while paper with match trademarks printed on it is taxed according to Article 551. Thus, the tax rate for the same paper is two-thirds higher before printing than after printing. Compared to the two, the tax rate is unbalanced. We submitted a document to your Association on June 30th of last year to forward it to the Ministry of Finance and instruct the Tariff Commission to provide relief. A year has passed, but no response has been received. The cost of match trademark paper is half paper and half ink and printing. In theory, the tax rate for matchbox paper without trademarks printed on it should be lower than for matchbox paper with trademarks printed on it. However, the Customs taxes matchbox paper without trademarks printed on it according to Article 552, which is two-thirds higher than the tax rate for matchbox paper with trademarks printed on it, reversing the order of importance. Since the implementation of the new tariff, printing businesses have suffered significant losses. If this continues, domestic match merchants will inevitably order box paper from abroad to avoid heavy taxes, and domestic printing businesses will be unable to compete. We hereby submit this petition again, hoping that you will forward it to the Ministry of Finance and instruct them to revise the tax rate for matchbox paper with trademarks printed on it to show fairness. The samples of matchbox paper with and without trademarks are attached. According to this, in July of last year, the Trade Association wrote a letter with the same content, and we immediately obtained the consent of the match industry, which agreed that the tax rate for paper without matchbox trademarks was higher than for paper with matchbox trademarks, which was unfair and should be revised. We telegraphed the Ministry to instruct the Tariff Commission to discuss and revise it. Almost a year has passed, but no reply has been received. Based on the previous situation, the color printing industry is deeply concerned about its interests and has asked us to modify Articles 551 and 552 of the new tariff. We believe their plea has merit. We have enclosed one sample each of match trademark paper and non-trademarked matchbox paper and submitted it on their behalf. We respectfully request that the Ministry examine and approve this and instruct the Tariff Commission to revise it fairly. We also hope for a reply for the sake of public convenience. Sincerely, The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.”</p>
<h3>Xinwei Relief Association Holds Joint Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Establishing Baiyunxiang New Village</h3>
<p>The Xinwei Relief Association held a joint meeting of the executive directors and the preparatory committee for the Baiyunxiang Refugee New Village at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. More than ten people attended, including Xu Shiying, Qian Jingping, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Yiting, Wen Lanting, Zhao Jiashu, and Hong Yulin. Xu Shiying presided over the meeting, and Ren Shizhen recorded the minutes. After the usual formalities,</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>When this association was established, it had over two thousand refugees transferred from the War Zone Refugee Relief Association whose resettlement was impossible. It was then proposed to organize a proactive relief effort to assist them. Fortunately, Mr. Chen Shuizhi of the National Government Relief Committee donated over 1,300 mu of farmland and over 600 mu of barren mountains in Baiyunxiang, Jiangning County. This association then requested the transfer of these lands to be used for the purpose of establishing a refugee new village, which was subsequently approved. At that time, Director Qu Wenliu believed that this was insufficient and requested that all of the land be allocated. This was also approved. However, there were no cadastral maps or records of the tenant farmers and their land, so it was necessary to first clear and survey the land. The Relief Committee then requested the Huai River Conservancy Commission to send surveyor Shen Guanke to conduct a survey with Relief Committee clerk Wu Shilin. After four months, the names of the tenant farmers, as well as the acreage of farmland and barren mountains, were cleared, surveyed, and recorded in detail. Seven overall maps, forty-six farmland maps, and four barren mountain maps were created. In March of this year, Mr. Zhao Jiashu was invited to plan and implement the new village project. Mr. Zhao is a graduate of Jiangnan Higher Industrial School and has served as the director of the Anhui Provincial Fourth Agricultural and Forestry Station and the principal of the Seventh Vocational School. He has specialized knowledge, rich experience, and is young and hardworking, making him extremely valuable. He has now compiled a five-year outline for the phased implementation of the project, which is now presented for discussion.</p>
<h3>Matters for Discussion</h3>
<p>(1) Mr. Zhao Jiashu stated that in March of this year, he was instructed by the chairman to plan the establishment of the Baiyunxiang New Village. It was difficult to proceed without conducting an on-site investigation. He invited Mr. Wu Shilin of the Relief Committee to accompany him. He learned that all the farmland and barren mountains there were very suitable for rice planting and tree planting. Moreover, the local government, the town government, and the public security bureau were all willing to assist in the preparatory work, making it easy to implement. He then drafted a phased outline for the new village project according to the local conditions and immediately planted 150,000 seedlings of Masson pine, black pine, and Chinese tallow trees on the barren mountains of Jinsongao and Huanglongxian. However, the current tenant farmers are extremely impoverished and lack the capital to sow seeds. It is necessary to first establish a cooperative with a fund of approximately 1,400 yuan and a loan office with a fund of approximately 600 yuan to provide relief, so that everything can proceed more smoothly. Is this feasible? Please make a resolution. (Resolution) The outline was approved and will be undertaken by this association. As for the cooperative and loan office funds, 1,000 yuan will be allocated first, with the Relief Committee providing 500 yuan and this association providing 500 yuan, to be given to Mr. Zhao Jiashu to establish them. If the outline needs to be modified in practice, it will still be submitted to the executive directors for resolution and implementation. (2) Qian Jingping, Huang Hanzhi, and Guan</p>
<p>Jiongzhi stated that the outline includes provisions for raising sheep, chickens, and fish,</p>
<p>which may inevitably involve the killing of living beings. King Wen's benevolence extended to insects, and Tang the Successful Emperor left one side open. In the future, in production activities, please take extra care to avoid harming living beings in order to embody the virtue of Heaven's love for life. (Resolution) Approved as is. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>West Section of Pucao Road Completed</h3>
<p>Yang Xinzheng, the municipal commissioner of the Caoging area of western Shanghai, in order to promote the development of transportation and prosperity in western Shanghai, proposed to extend the road westward from the Caoxi Road intersection to Yaojiawan Bridge, turning north through Hongqiao Town to Luo Biegen Road, naming it Pucao Road, which is twelve li long. He submitted a request to the municipal government for approval, but it was temporarily put on hold due to the city's financial constraints. Last winter, Huang Jinrong funded the construction of the section from the west of the Caoxi Road intersection to the Huang family garden, which is now open to traffic. The western section from the Huang family garden to Yaojiawan Bridge also began construction last month and will soon be completed. Luo Biegen Road to Hongqiao Town has also been completed. However, the middle section from Yaojiawan Bridge to Hongqiao Town has not yet been surveyed. It is estimated that the entire road will be completed around winter.</p>
<h3>Municipal Land Bureau Issues Land Certificates for Zhabei, Starting from May 15th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau issued Public Notice No. 116 yesterday regarding the issuance of land occupation certificates for households in Block 91 of the Zhabei District: "The land of households in Block 9 and Map 1 of the Zhabei District (east to Baoan Road, Desiwei Road, south to Yingui Road, west to Shuidian Road, north to Shajing Port) was surveyed by the Baoshan Land Survey Bureau and issued occupation certificates more than twenty years ago. Since then, there have been divisions, mergers, road construction, river closures, resulting in changes in the boundaries of many households. In some cases, transfers have not been completed after sales, and there is a discrepancy between the household paying taxes and the property owner. In order to reorganize the land, this bureau has re-surveyed it, which has now been completed. It is scheduled to begin exchanging land occupation certificates on May 15th. All households in the block are hereby notified to promptly bring their occupation certificates, tax receipts, old land occupation certificates with the old numbers given by this bureau, and other property rights documents to this bureau within one month to complete the exchange procedures. It is in the interest of your property rights, so please do not delay. This announcement is made."</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Must Re-elect Within a Time Limit; City Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to Various Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to various trade associations, stating: "The terms of office of trade association officers are determined in accordance with the Commercial Association Law. Executive and supervisory committee members have a term of four years, with half being re-elected every two years. The first re-election is determined by lottery. In the 21st year of the Republic (1932), various trade associations in this city delayed the first re-election in accordance with the Central People's Movement Steering Committee's order to postpone the re-election. Last year, the Bureau of Social Affairs forwarded a Ministry of Industry and Commerce order urging the re-election. Because many of them exceeded the two-year re-election period when the Ministry's order was received, if the first re-election was held soon after the second re-election, it would not comply with the rule of re-electing every ten years. It was submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs, which forwarded it to the Ministry for approval and determined that the two-year period for re-election should be counted from the date of the implementation of the Ministry's re-election document last year, and then every two years. The Bureau of Social Affairs also issued an order limiting each association to complete the process before June 15th of this year. This association recorded the order and sent it out, sending two staff members, Yuan Hongjun and Li Ruzhang, to relay it. However, there are many associations that only carried out their first re-election after the deadline. If there are members whose four-year term is about to expire, is this time to re-elect all of them, or is it still to re-elect half of them by lottery? There is still doubt. After this association submitted a request for instructions, the Bureau of Social Affairs approved and opened the submission. The bureau found that the first re-election of trade association officers should be carried out by lottery to re-elect half of the members, as clearly stipulated by law. The temporary exemption from re-election in the first year was a special circumstance of the case decided and circulated by the Central People's Movement Steering Committee Conference. It is hoped that the association will still follow the previous order and quickly instruct its subordinates, and each association that has not held a re-election, must follow the method of the first re-election before June 15th of this year. The batch announcement is hoped to be checked and followed."</p>
<h3>Capital Spring National Exhibition Hires Ye Hancheng and Others as Review Committee</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Spring National Products Exhibition of the National Products Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Trade in the capital, yesterday, Mr. Ye Hancheng, standing committee member of the Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Federation, and others were specially hired as members of the review committee. The original letter of appointment stated: "It has been ordered to the Ministry for the record that the National Products Exhibition Hall of the Ministry will hold a Spring National Products Exhibition. It is now reported by the hall that the above exhibition has been opened on the 2nd of this month. According to the provisions of Article 12 of the hall's regulations, the exhibits should be reviewed during the exhibition period, and the best should be awarded prizes.

<h3>Blind and Deaf-Mute Joint Entertainment Performance</h3>

<h3>Accomplices in Robbery and Murder Case in Wuwei County, Anhui Province Arrested; Transferred to Wuwei after Trial by Special Court</h3>
<p>Between the 27th day of the 9th month of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), the Ding family in Wuwei County, Anhui Province was broken into and robbed of property worth hundreds of silver dollars. When fleeing, the intruder shot and killed Ding Defu, a member of the family. Subsequently, the local Public Security Bureau arrested the ringleader of the robbers, Hua Guozhen, who has been executed. Recently, the victim's family received an anonymous letter stating that an accomplice, Liu Yukai (also known as Chen Jiafu, Zhang Zuofa), from Anhui Province, was hiding at No. 20 Yuande Lane, Huade Road, Shanghai Public Concession. They reported this to the local county government, which sent bailiff Shuai Bangyou, accompanied by Wang Xinglong, a servant of the Ding family, to Shanghai on the 20th of last month, and requested the cooperation of the Yulin Road Police Station to arrest him. The Chinese and Western detectives went to the address and arrested Liu, and sent him to the First Special District Court. The defendant denied his name was Liu Yukai and completely denied the Ding family robbery case. They were ordered to be detained pending the submission of evidence by the Wuwei County Government before further verification. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui arrived at the third criminal court to continue the trial. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that the county bailiff now held a formal public statement and a confession made before the suspect was arrested, confirming the name Liu Yukai. The police station did not object to the extradition of the defendant. Bailiff Shuai Bangyou submitted an official letter, reporting a past interrogation of the defendant, who admitted his name was Zhang Zuofa, but firmly denied being a thief. Judge Liu ordered that Liu Yukai, namely Chen Jiafu, also known as Zhang Zuofa, be handed over to the Wuwei County Government for the police to bring back for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Tooth Brokerage Certificate Levies Self-Government Fees</h3>
<p>Due to insufficient self-government funds in Shanghai County, in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), former County Magistrate Yan presented a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Education Fund Management Office, which ordered that from the 20th year onwards, two yuan would be levied for each first-class tooth brokerage certificate, one yuan and five dimes for the second-class, one yuan for the third-class, and five dimes for the fourth-class, to be allocated to self-government funds. In the 21st and 22nd years, former County Magistrate Yan subsequently submitted requests to continue levying the fees. Now, the budget for the 23rd year is found to be insufficient. County Magistrate Pan believed that it would be difficult to maintain this self-government fund without continuing to levy it in the old way, so he submitted a request to continue levying it. The Education Fund Management Office has now instructed that the levy be continued for one year, and will be terminated after the end of the year. The tooth brokers have already been notified to comply and pay the fees.</p>

<p>At around 9:20 a.m. yesterday, Xu Gui, a woman from Taizhou, who lived in a straw shed behind Guangfu Road, north of Caogadu, western Shanghai, was cooking when she suddenly demanded rent from her tenant, Pan Youzhong, but failed, and they quarreled and fought.

<h3>Straw Hat Workers' Evil Farce of Throwing Dung: Zhang Jifu Arrested on the Spot for One Throw, Wang Xiangfen Escaped After Being Hit by Another</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 4 o'clock, as Zhang Jifu of the Kaifu Kee Straw Hat Shop, a native of Menghe, was passing through Guangqi Road in the city, he was suddenly attacked by a thug who threw a paper package full of fecal liquid at Zhang's head. Police officers arrived at the scene and arrested the assailant, taking him to the Second Precinct of the First District. According to the assailant's confession, his name is Xia Ating, and he works in a certain straw hat shop. He stated that he came here because the plaintiff refused the workers' demand for increased wages, so he wanted to let Zhang taste the stench to vent public anger. The precinct prepared a document to send to the bureau for further investigation. Unexpectedly, at around 11 o'clock yesterday morning, Wang Xiangfen, the owner of the Wang Hengchang Straw Hat Shop at No. 201 Fangbang Road, Xiaodongmen, and a native of Wuxi, was out on business. As he was passing by the entrance of Linxian Fang on Guangqi Road, he was also met by a thug who came face to face and, taking advantage of Wang's unpreparedness, threw a similar paper package at Wang's head. The package also contained fecal liquid, which caused the paper package to break and the fecal liquid to spill out, staining Wang's mouth and nose. A foul odor filled the air, and those who smelled it covered their noses. At that time, the thug, seeing that his goal had been achieved, immediately turned around and fled. Wang immediately reported the situation to the Second Precinct of the First District, requesting a thorough investigation.</p>

They fled through the door, and as they were leaving, the bandits, fearing that the owner would chase after them and shout for help, fired a shot into the air as a warning. Nearby police officers heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, but the bandits had already gone far away. They then accompanied the owner to report the incident to the police station, requesting that the bandits be apprehended.</p>

<h3>Opening Today: Shanghai West National Goods Emporium - Inaugurated by the Mayor's Wife, Flag Raising by Mr. Lin Kecong</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West District National Goods Temporary Emporium, sponsored by the Municipal Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee, was originally scheduled to open on May 9th. However, due to incomplete engineering construction, the opening was postponed. It is now learned that the emporium's preparations have been completed, and the various manufacturers have also completed their arrangements. It has been decided to open the emporium today. Mrs. Wu, the Mayor's wife, has been specially invited to cut the ribbon, and Mr. Lin Kecong will raise the flag. Leaders of the national goods industry at sea will give speeches, and the Material Salvation Newspaper will print and distribute 50,000 special issues for the emporium. The participating manufacturers include Shanghai National Goods Company, China National Goods Company, Family Industrial Cooperative, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Zhanghua Woolen Mill, Aupu Ear Electric Lamp Factory, Yantai Beer, Guanshengyuan, China Enamel Factory, Minsheng Textile Factory, Guangdong Brothers Rubber Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, Guanghua Printing Company, China Native Cloth Store, Shengsheng Milk Company, Xiangxing Leather Factory, Yansheng Industrial Cooperative, Wanchangyong Mat Shop, Renchangyong Material Factory, Jinglun Weaving Factory, Maochang Fruit Shop, Xuechi Umbrella Factory, Cuitai Hao, Daxingyuan Mat Shop, Jingcheng Weaving Factory, Yuan Weaving Factory, Wuzhou Weaving Factory, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Jinlang Cosmetics Company, Dahua Steel Factory, Zhengtai Rubber Factory, Yixin Toothbrush Factory, China First Knitting Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Forest Knee Device Factory, Shinyi Chemical Factory, Taikang Company, Washeng Electric Appliance Factory, and Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, totaling more than 40 national goods factories with thousands of exquisite products, which will be sold at low prices at the same time. The opening declaration is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Promoting national goods is a duty that every citizen should fulfill, and resisting enemy goods is a determination that every Chinese person should possess. However, year after year of promotion and resistance, foreign goods continue to flow in steadily, increasing year after year, causing domestic industry and commerce to be in a state of near collapse. If we do not deeply consider and understand the root causes and seek effective remedies, how can a nation on the verge of extinction and a country as precarious as a pile of eggs seek to revitalize and survive? In view of this, this committee believes that to revitalize industry, we must first expand its publicity, and to promote national goods, we must first popularize its understanding. Therefore, we are sponsoring the Shanghai West District National Goods Temporary Emporium, which opens today. We hope that all women in the city will uphold the concepts of patriotism and national salvation, make good use of their consumption, and practice purchasing national goods, and persuade their relatives and friends to fully understand the value and effect of using national goods. We firmly believe that concentrating the purchasing power of the entire nation to purchase and use national goods is enough to help our country become strong and secure the survival of our nation, and it is also enough to connect friendly relations and punish the violent. However, we cannot properly use our annual leaks and overflows, resulting in an annual loss of more than 100 million yuan, which has helped to strengthen the construction of the violent enemy and has led to the current poor and weak situation in our country. Tracing the origin, it is actually our own doing. Therefore, how should the Chinese people try to save themselves? The way to save ourselves is to gather the purchasing power of all patriotic and courageous people in the country to reject foreign goods and use national goods, to block the source of enemy looting and killing, and to build a foundation for self-strengthening and revenge. We know that the power to control consumption and the authority of purchasing power lie entirely in women. If our women can deeply understand the great righteousness, follow the call of the Women's National Goods Promotion Year, awaken and become aware, endure hardships and determination, and rise up together, without being seduced by the beautiful faces and clever colors of enemy goods, or by the temptation of price reductions and competitive sales, resolutely resist enemy goods and love buying national goods, then their merits in overcoming the enemy and saving the country will not be difficult to achieve good results in ten or twenty years, which will be presented to the people of the country. Now, the Shanghai West District National Goods Temporary Emporium of this committee has opened. We deeply hope that our women will strengthen their patriotic spirit and happily use national goods to save the dying country and lay the foundation for building a prosperous nation, so that there will be a record of women saving the country with national goods in future history, to glorify the spirit of our nation and enhance the reputation of our women. This humble intention should be supported by the women's community. With this declaration, we wish to unite and rise together.</p>

<h3>International Grand Hotel to Be Completed Soon - Initiated by Yan Huiqing, Shi Zhaoji, Wang Rutang, etc. - To Extend Hospitality to Foreign Guests in a Hotel Run by Chinese</h3>
<p>Introducing Chinese Famous Dishes to International Guests</p>
<p>The 22-story building built by the Sihang Savings Society on Jing'an Temple Road will be completed soon. In addition to the society reserving the lower floors for business premises, the upper floors will be used as the International Grand Hotel. News of this has been briefly reported in the past. It is now learned that the Western name of this International Grand Hotel is Park Hotel. The important initiators are Yan Huiqing, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Rutang, Shi Zhaoji, Wu Daquan, Chen Guangfu, Zhou Zuomin, Hu Bijang, and others. The purpose of the initiators is to provide foreign guests with a hotel run by Chinese. Although the hotel business in Shanghai is developed, when foreign guests arrive in Shanghai, the Chinese have no hotels of their own to manage and entertain them, so they always stay in hotels run by foreigners. The initiators, in view of this, raised funds to start a hotel, which is also a matter of international concern. The total capital is 800,000 yuan, and an International Grand Hotel Co., Ltd. has been organized to manage the business. The facilities in the hotel are superior to those in the first-class hotels run by foreigners, and the rents are lower. Except for the necessary foreign employees, all other management personnel are Chinese. In addition to a Western kitchen, the hotel also has an exquisite Chinese kitchen, the purpose of which is to introduce Chinese famous dishes to foreign guests.</p>
<h3>Temple Fairs and Parades Held in Zhabei and Pudong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dragon Lanterns and Stilt Parades Compete for Beauty</p>
<p>Streets Packed with People, Impassable</p>
<h3>Zhabei Doutian Fair</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 9:00 AM, the Zhabei Zhongxing Road Doutian Temple held a grand parade for the Doutian Great Emperor Wanfu Victory Fair. It was held simultaneously in both Pudong and Zhabei, attracting a large crowd, making it the largest event ever seen in Zhabei. The association had been preparing for a long time, so all kinds of dragon lanterns and stilt parades competed for beauty. Banners and flags fluttered along the way, and drums and music filled the air. More than 100,000 people participated in the parade. The parade started from Zhabei Doutian Temple, passed through Zhongxing Road, Gonghe Road, Meiyuan Road, Hengfeng Road, and all the way to Shanbanchang Xinqiao, before returning to the temple. Starting from 9:00 AM, the parade route was still not finished by 5:00 PM. At that time, the crowd in Gonghe Xin Road, Xinmin Road, Guangfu Road, and other areas surged like a tide, and the shops along the street were packed with people, making it impassable. It did not end until around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Pudong Xiaoren Fair</h3>
<p>This year's temple fairs and parades are quite popular in various places. Yesterday, a so-called Xiaoren Fair, which was held for the first time, was suddenly held in Pudong. The participants were all children and young people aged from eleven or twelve to eighteen or nineteen. With the support of adults, the situation was exceptionally lively, and the audience was amazed. It turned out that in the past, a certain couple lived in a house owned by the Cai family west of Shiqiao in Shenjia Lane, Pudong. Because they were deeply superstitious, they kept idols at home for worship. Later, the couple died one after another, and the room has been empty ever since, and no one has taken care of the idols. Recently, someone spread the news that the god was the spirit of the Jade Mansion God in the Qixin Temple, more than ten miles southeast of Yangjing, and had once appeared in a dream, wanting a group of children to respectfully parade the god for a week to exorcise demons. Therefore, ignorant children believed it to be true and played the part of joining the association, with all kinds of patterns fully prepared, stretching for about two or three miles. District Chief Zhang of the Third District believed that this act was promoting superstition and that there were too many spectators, which would hinder public order. Therefore, he advised them to parade in the fields far away from the city and not to enter the prosperous towns. At the same time, he sent more capable police officers to suppress them separately, so the order was still good.</p>
<h3>Construction of Branch Line Track in the Central Area of the City - Ministry of Railways Believes That the Railway Bureau Has No Cash to Allocate - Construction Costs Should Be Subsidized by the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Regarding the construction of a branch line track in the Sanmin Road area of the city center, the municipal authorities once held consultations with the Railway Bureau. The Railway Bureau submitted the points of consultation to the Ministry of Railways for review. It is now learned that the Ministry of Railways has issued an order to the two Railway Administrations, saying in essence that the Sanmin Road area is not yet prosperous and that there are already buses running. The branch line seems to be able to be postponed. If the municipal government believes that construction is necessary, then the estimated construction cost will be 38,000 yuan. The Railway Bureau currently has no cash available for allocation and should request the municipal government to provide assistance. Moreover, it is inconvenient for the trains on the Songhu branch line to include the section of the route in the schedule and it is necessary to add an interval train between Baoshan Road and Sanmin Road. If the revenue and expenditure of this section cannot offset each other in the future, how will the municipal government assist the Railway Bureau in jointly maintaining it? The above two points should be discussed and discussed with the municipal government, and then submitted for approval.</p>

There was another note instructing his younger brother, Zhou Yongnian, who worked as a waiter at the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road, to come and collect the body. Each word was full of tears, making it unbearable to read. Therefore, the corpse was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. At the same time, his younger brother was notified to appear in court.

<p>Han Tengshi, the wife of Han Zhengqing, a native of Taizhou from Caonitang, Yangjiadu, Pudong, was repeatedly seduced by Tang Zhaokun, a fellow apprentice, into adultery and refused to change. Han Zhengqing angrily shot and killed Tang. Gu Liancheng and Hu Kuisheng, the team leaders of the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrested him and transferred him to the District Court for prosecution. Han Zhengqing stated that his wife had been violated, and he went to threaten Tang, but unexpectedly this tragedy occurred. The family of the deceased said that it was because of resentment over borrowing money. Therefore, the detectives were summoned to prove the adultery, and it was stated that the Siming Hotel was the place of assignation. Judge Luo Renji of the court, in order to prevent any injustice, sought details and summoned Xi Changji, a waiter at the Siming Hotel, yesterday, who presented a circulation book, proving that adultery had indeed occurred in June of last year. However, Huang Bujin, who was summoned to provide information about mediating and borrowing a pistol as alleged by Han Zhengqing, was present in court and strongly defended the deceased, saying that there was no immoral relationship with his sister-in-law. He claimed that the mediation was about Han's wife gambling and the couple quarreling, and he had offered advice, but he did not know of any other incidents.

They demanded 3,600 yuan in compensation. In the end, they said that the defendant had no money and they only wanted his life. The official said that the sentence would be decided by the court, and the private prosecution was temporarily withdrawn and could be filed separately in the future.

<h3>Wine Industry Association: Request to Permit Universal Repackaging of Local Liquor</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Municipal and County Wine Industry Trade Association Joint Conference, yesterday, based on letters from its county members, requested that the universal repackaging of local liquor within the province be permitted and handled by the district branch bureaus, to benefit commercial transportation and increase tax revenue. The association, based on the situation, submitted separate requests to the Ministry of Finance, the Tax Affairs Administration, and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Liquor Tax Bureau for approval, and also sent letters to the National Federation of Commerce and the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce, considering the hardship of wine merchants throughout the province, to assist in the petition. The original submission is recorded below: The submission is to request, based on the situation, that universal repackaging of local liquor within the province be permitted, and handled by the district branch bureaus, to benefit commercial transportation and increase tax revenue. We respectfully request your consideration. The association has received letters from the Kunshan, Yixing, Liyang, Jintan, Danyang and other county wine industry associations stating that the new regulations for fixed tax on local liquor have a repackaging provision, originally intended to consider the situation of merchants and facilitate transportation. However, since the trial implementation in this province, restrictions on repackaging locations have meant that liquor from County A cannot enjoy the same treatment as County B, and the liquor that should be repackaged in each county has been hindered by various obstacles, failing to be transported out immediately, or even unable to be repackaged, thus delaying sales. Therefore, although the fixed tax system has not been implemented for long, the suffering of merchants and the people is deeply felt. The local liquor market relies on market price fluctuations and inventory levels for transportation. Therefore, the actual need for repackaging is not limited to commercially prosperous areas; it is the same even in remote areas. Spirits, sorghum liquor, and the like all require repackaging regardless of location, and restrictions cause many obstacles. Because merchants mostly collect the original containers after a transaction, liquor from location A that has paid taxes and has complete transportation permits, upon being transported to location B, and placed in different containers, will not have tax certificates on the new containers. If the transportation permit is used as a standard, there will be no problems when purchasing at retail outlets. However, in the case of wholesale transportation, it will be impossible to prove whether the local liquor has been declared and taxed. If it is allowed to be transported and sold without a certificate, cunning merchants will be able to use this as an excuse to transport smuggled goods, which will not only hinder tax revenue but also harm business. If it is considered that smuggled liquor should be strictly cracked down upon, then liquor that has been taxed will also be suppressed, which is unfair. To remedy this, the only solution is universal repackaging and meticulous procedures. Otherwise, the collecting agencies will lack verification standards, and harassment will be unavoidable, which will have a significant impact on business. When the new system was first established, your association requested modifications to the various obstacles of the new system, and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Liquor Tax Bureau issued approval No. 135, approving the extension of local liquor repackaging, with Wujin as the repackaging location, and permitting requests for increased designated extensions at any time in locations with integrated tax management or inspection agencies, which can consider the situation. The provincial bureau was aware of the need for repackaging of local liquor in various counties, but the universal establishment of integrated tax inspection agencies has not been possible, so the local liquor repackaging locations must be limited by the existence of inspection agencies. Now that the district branch bureau system has changed, each county has established tax collection offices, with the director responsible for collection and remittance, verifying the assessment amount, and implementing a three-level system. The district branch director is in a purely supervisory position, and is no longer directly responsible for collection and remittance as before, and supervision from a third party should be comparable. Subsequently, the district branch director should assign personnel to various locations to perform the duties of inspection and repackaging in accordance with regulations, without the tax inspection agencies also handling it. In this way, repackaging can be universally continued and easily inspected. The district branch director has a special responsibility, which can unify authority, and merchants will not have their transportation of local liquor delayed due to disputes or harassment, which will benefit both tax revenue and business prospects. The various counties represented by our association are all outside the designated repackaging locations. Now that the district branch bureau system is being changed, in order to eliminate the suffering of the industry and facilitate the transportation of local liquor, we jointly request your association to investigate, and urgently petition the Ministry of Finance, the Tax Affairs Administration, and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Liquor Tax Bureau to allow universal repackaging of local liquor transported and sold within the province, regardless of the place of production or sale, with verification by personnel assigned by the district branch director, in order to alleviate the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants and emphasize taxation. According to the association, local liquor repackaging facilitates commercial transportation, strict inspection, business can be developed, and tax revenue can be increased. If restrictions are imposed, not only will transportation be obstructed, but the tax administration will have more abuses. The association requests that universal repackaging of local liquor transported and sold within the province, regardless of place of production or sale, be permitted, and handled by the district branch bureaus, which can unify authority and avoid harassment, benefiting both taxation and merchants, and is a crucial plan for the future of the liquor industry. Based on the above, in addition to separate submissions, we hereby submit a formal request, hoping that you will consider the difficulties of merchants, grant the request, and approve the implementation, for which we will be grateful. Submitted to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, Director Wu of the Tax Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, Director Sheng of the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Liquor Tax Bureau, Chairman Zhang Dalian of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Municipal and County Wine Industry Trade Association Joint Conference, Committee Member Jin Yunjie, Dai Zhuoan.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Industry Association: Special District Office Holds Board Meeting</h3>
<p>The Special District Office of the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Trade Association held a board meeting at 9 PM the night before last. Board members Yin Zuzhai, Lu Dexin, Bao Zhenhuang, Gu Songmao, Hou Shaoan, Yin Zhiling, Liu Shengwu, and fifteen others attended the meeting. Gu Songmao was elected chairman. The meeting specifically discussed the warning issued by the Public Works Department's Traffic Office when rickshaw owners receive small tickets, stating that those who replace parts on the rickshaw will have the rickshaw confiscated. This does not consider whether rickshaw owners can accept this warning, and it is being implemented rashly, with parts being detained, which is inconsistent with both law and human sentiment. After discussion, it was decided that this matter is of great importance, and five board members, Hou Shaoan, Yin Zhiling, Lu Dexin, Bao Zhenhuang, and Gu Songmao, were elected to attend a meeting with the Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department next Monday (today) to petition for the preservation of the rickshaw industry's capital and to ensure the elimination of arbitrary confiscation. The meeting adjourned at 11 PM.</p>
<h3>Shandong Native Association Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday, Elected 18 Executive Committee Members, and Solicited Members</h3>
<p>The Shandong Native Association in Shanghai has been in preparation for some time and is now ready. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the inaugural meeting was held at the Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road. More than 30 members of the association and representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhao Erchang, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Zhu Zhen, attended. After the formalities, Chairman Zhang Xiangyun reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by speeches from representatives of party and government agencies. Then the election began. As a result, Zhang Renkui, Gao Shikui, Zhang Shuixiu, Wang Lanxing, Liu Chunpu, Li Shoucheng, and 12 others were elected as executive committee members. After the election, a group photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. The association also issued a declaration soliciting members, saying: To our fellow Shandong natives, Greetings. Our Qilu region is located on the coast and has a penchant for activity. Wherever there are major cities and commercial hubs, there are footprints of our Qilu people. Shanghai is particularly densely populated, with some entering officialdom for advancement, others seeking wealth, others dedicating themselves to learning to become pillars of the party and the country, others working diligently to increase social production, and still others facing adversity and feeling lost. The population of residents is large, and the livelihoods vary. To achieve collective good, organization is necessary to maintain cohesion. To protect one's reputation, mutual assistance is necessary to facilitate benefits. Renkui and others have lived in Shanghai for a long time and have deep feelings. They know that without organizing a native association, it is impossible to connect the feelings of fellow natives and increase their happiness. Therefore, without considering our limitations, we initiated the drafting of bylaws and started activities. After months of preparation, we have reached a certain scale. On March 26, we submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, which passed the examination and issued a license, approving the preparation and organization. Now, in order to consolidate strength and solicit members to promote universal benefits, we sincerely hope that our fellow Shandong natives will actively join and work together, upholding the spirit of mutual assistance, making it easier for everyone to lift. We hope to renew our lives and preserve our hometown feelings. Although we are thousands of miles away, our hearts are as one. Let us uphold the traditions of etiquette and righteousness, and cherish the meaning of kindness. There is no greater benefit. All fellow natives who wish to join are invited to visit the association to read the bylaws and follow the procedures in order to participate in our work. Fellow natives, let us come together and support each other. The association will be very welcoming and honored. We hereby announce this, hoping you will understand.</p>

<h3>Published Books Should Be Submitted for Review: Deadline for Legal Submission, Otherwise Punishment Will Be Imposed</h3>
<p>The Ministry of the Interior stated that published books should be submitted for review in accordance with Article 15 of the Publication Law. However, it has been found that many published books have not been submitted in accordance with the law. Therefore, yesterday, the Ministry consulted with the Bureau of Education and the Bureau of Social Affairs to instruct publishers to submit the books within the deadline, otherwise they will be punished in accordance with the law. The text stated: Article 15 of the Publication Law stipulates that publishers of books or other publications should submit two copies to the Ministry of the Interior for revision, addition, or deletion upon publication. The same applies to previously published works that are being reissued. This has been repeatedly instructed and announced. Recently, the number of published books has been increasing, and while most have complied with the order to submit them to the Ministry for review, many have not. Therefore, we are consulting again to instruct all publishers under your jurisdiction that all books that have not been submitted to the Ministry in accordance with Article 15 of the Publication Law must be submitted within one month of the date of this document. Those who fail to submit within the deadline will be subject to on-site inspection and severely punished in accordance with Article 33 of the Publication Law, without leniency. All publications that have not been registered in accordance with the law do not enjoy copyright protection and have no effect against third parties. The words "Copyright Reserved" should not be used at the end of the volume to avoid confusion.</p>
<h3>Modern Bookstore Hosted Literary and Art Circles Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Modern Bookstore on Simalu, Shanghai, is the only new bookstore specializing in the publication of periodicals. In the past, it has published no fewer than several dozens of periodicals, all of which have been warmly welcomed by readers. Recently, due to various reasons, some have been discontinued or reorganized. The bookstore, recognizing the popularity of periodicals and the needs of readers, has launched a new weekly publication called "One Week" in addition to its existing literary periodical "Modern Magazine" and children's periodical "Modern Children." "One Week" is edited by famous writers Hong Shen and Zhang Changren. Last night, the bookstore, together with the editorial departments of the three periodicals, hosted a banquet at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road for over fifty prominent figures from the literary, art, and journalism circles in Shanghai. The banquet was first addressed by the general manager of the bookstore, Hong Xuefan, who gave a welcoming speech and reported on the bookstore's past publishing activities and future plans. Next, Hong Shen, editor of "One Week," reported on the differences between the content of the publication and other general publications, stating that the criticism would be what people dare not say, and the news would be what people do not easily interview. However, he still hoped that the literary, art, and journalism circles would provide full support. Then, Shi Zhicun, editor of "Modern Magazine," said that since the magazine's founding two years ago, it has relied on the joint efforts of the national literary community and the encouragement of readers to achieve its current position. The authors and readers have been in love for a long time, and today's reunion is a belated wedding ceremony. Finally, Zhang Kuang, editor of "Modern Children," and Song Yi, the former editor of the publication, exchanged opinions. The banquet ended at 10 PM, with the guests and hosts enjoying themselves.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Management Association Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its 49th dinner discussion meeting at the Lianhua General Association on Beijing Road yesterday. Over forty people attended, including Li Zhaohuan, Hu Xiyuan, Pan Yangyao, Huang Puqi, Tu Zheyin, Cheng Shouzhong, etc. Cao Yunxiang presided over the meeting, and Bingxun Stenography Agency recorded the proceedings. First, Gu Bingyuan spoke on "The Relationship between Labor Laws and Factory Management," stating that factories should set up a personnel department to study labor laws and be responsible for management. As for the staff, the Kao Gong Ji system should be adopted. If factories can proceed in this way, labor disputes can be avoided, and the Labor Dispute Law can resolve disputes between labor and management, first through mediation and then through arbitration. However, in the event of a disturbance, it is best to resolve it independently, rather than going to the government for arbitration. Then, Zhu Maocheng spoke on "How to Eliminate Labor Disputes," stating that the prerequisite for eliminating labor disputes is to understand the psychological relationship between labor and management. At present, workers often disregard the suffering of employers, and employers do not pay attention to the living conditions of workers, resulting in mutual animosity. Workers then use trivial matters to instigate disturbances, resulting in great harm to both sides. Therefore, to avoid disputes, it is necessary to be open and honest and to seek cooperation in psychology (1) Study human engineering (2) Consult with workers within the possible range (3) Maintain a fair attitude (4) Be clear in handling affairs (5) Cooperate with each other. In this way, there will be no misunderstandings between labor and management. In short, employers should consider the living and safety issues of workers, and workers must be diligent in their duties and understand the suffering of employers. If both sides meet sincerely, labor disputes can be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Promotion of Domestic Chinese Cotton Fabric Market: Inviting Cotton Fabric Dealers from All Provinces and Cities to Purchase Goods and Jointly Promote the Universal Use of Domestic Yarn and Fabric</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chinese Domestic Cotton Fabric Market moved into its newly built building in Jiyi Lane, Tianjin Road, last month and officially opened, business has been very prosperous. The market's main purpose is to promote domestic yarn and cotton fabrics and to control the household cotton fabric industry. In addition to purchasing and selling goods from small machine households, the market also has 3,000 basic machine households dedicated to manufacturing custom orders. Therefore, the goods in the market are not only complete in variety and consistent in quality, but also have fixed standard prices. Recently, in order to unify its products, the market is working to standardize the weight, quality, length, and width of various cotton fabrics, making purchasing and sales convenient. The market is particularly serious about accepting goods in order to eliminate the long-standing practice of crude and substandard production by machine households and to improve the quality of domestic cotton fabrics. Yesterday, the market sent letters to chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities across the country, asking them to forward the letters to local cotton fabric dealers to visit the market to purchase goods, in order to promote business and the universal use of domestic yarn and cotton fabrics.</p>
<h3>Youth Apprentice Commits Suicide in Hat Cleaning Shop</h3>
<p>Tiancheng Hat Cleaning Shop, located at 104 Fangxie Road, Wansheng Bridge, Ximen, Nanshi, is owned by Chen Shichao. In March of last year, Jiang Cilin, 18 years old, the son of Jiang Jingou from Chongming, was introduced to the shop as an apprentice. He was usually diligent and conscientious in his work. Unexpectedly, the apprentice, feeling hopeless about his humble profession and future, conceived a pessimistic thought. The night before last, he bought raw opium and secretly ingested it. Yesterday morning, his colleagues discovered him in a dying state, beyond rescue. He soon died. The shop owner reported the situation to the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which sent police to investigate. A suicide note from the deceased to his colleagues was found, stating, "There is no benefit for me in this world, and I cannot learn to escape it, so I am committing suicide." The suicide note was submitted as evidence. The police ordered the local guarantor to request the court to examine the body, and summoned the shop owner for interrogation, ordering him to be released on bail and notifying the deceased's family to collect the body.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Meeting of the Electric Welding Industry Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Welding Industry Trade Association held its fourth preparatory meeting at 2 PM yesterday. Wang Rongtang, Liu Moquan, Wang Zhiyuan, Zhu Guoxiang, Zhang Yutang, Rong Huaqing, and more than ten others attended. Wang Rongtang was elected chairman. After the chairman's report, the cases were discussed. (1) Soliciting members for the trade association. It was decided that the preparatory committee and initiators would be responsible for soliciting members. (2) During the solicitation period, meetings would be held every Saturday at 7 PM to report on progress. The declaration is also recorded below: Our country has had an electric welding industry for nearly 20 years. Initially, only foreigners established factories to operate it. Then, Chinese people became familiar with the content and knew that electric welding was a novel business and a kind of modern mechanical trend, and they also started to establish and operate businesses. Recently, the number of businesses has increased, and factories have sprung up. It is estimated that more than 2,000 people rely on electric welding for a living. However, there has been no group organization in the past, and businesses have been operating independently. There is no spirit of communication and mutual assistance, nor is there hope for research and progress, so that a good new business is not only dim in the future and wandering aimlessly. Now, in this era of economic downturn, there is indeed a trend that cannot be maintained. When businesses meet, they all harbor the hidden worry that bankruptcy is not far away, and life is difficult, the price has been devalued, and the credibility of our electric welding industry has been greatly lost to the outside world. There is also jealousy and differences of opinion among the industry, which affects the future development of our electric welding industry. The colleagues have seen this, so they have gathered the industry and organized a trade association in accordance with laws and regulations to seek mutual assistance and progress. I hope that all colleagues who are closely related and closely explore will not hesitate to teach us and work together to build a stable position for our electric welding industry and seek a prosperous life for our electric welding workers. This is a one-shot deal. I think that my dear colleagues will be able to agree and set this permanent foundation.</p>

<h3>Reading Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Inquiries into Natural Science</p>
<p>This is the first time this column has discussed natural science, for the following reasons: (1) such discussions may not arouse everyone's interest; (2) for such questions, we always ask experts to answer, and sometimes the answers are too brief to be published here. This time is an exception. The person answering this letter is a 19-year-old youth whose knowledge of natural science comes entirely from self-study. This is something we should pay special attention to. This young scholar is Mr. Tao Hong, the son of Mr. Tao Xingzhi. In addition to thanking Mr. Tao Hong, we would like to introduce him to the readers of this article to encourage those who study natural science independently. Editor's reading guidance:</p>
<p>Recently, I saw an article on "Clarifying Doubts" in the Reading Q&amp;A section, and you are indeed "not afraid of trouble." I think natural science would also be happy to explain things to us, right?</p>
<p>My current reading environment is not bad. I am doing "not time-consuming work" in a calcium carbonate factory. Because my ability in qualitative analysis is not good enough, I have not paid attention to anything other than chemistry. However, my greatest wish is to work in a mining area, so I plan to study mineralogy and so on at this time. I don't know which part of mineralogy is the most important? And in which aspect can I best obtain confirmation from books? When books talk about mineralogy, they just talk about it in the form of tables. How can I remember it? Now I only get various minerals and determine their properties. I don't know how others put in the effort? In addition, there are some practical questions, but they have exceeded your scope. I will write a few out first and hope you can answer them.</p>
<p>What is Larch Fungus Acid Agaricinicum?</p>
<p>A certain kind of limestone (only mixed in) burns out with ash that appears dark green in color, and when mixed with water, it is like mixing with a dye, with yellowish streaks. How can this be explained?</p>
<p>The West Mountain in Taihu Lake is limestone, and the west of Wu is mostly magmatic rock. Where is the approximate boundary? How can it be known? In Yangshan between the two, coal seedlings have been found. What is the relationship with the coal mines in West Mountain?</p>
<p>In the "Rough Research on Porcelain Raw Materials by the French" in the second issue of the fifteenth volume of Science, the analysis table of "Longbai, Wujin," etc. in the latter sections is written like this:</p>
<p>FusionHFsoluble H2SO4 soluble H2SO4 soluble Hclsoluble SiO2 H2O3 Fe2O3 TiO2 MnO3 M90 K2o Va2o</p>
<p>From this, how can we know that the composition of the original mineral is the solubility of silicate in Hcl and H2SO4? How is the solubility of SiO2 in the above table calculated? Furthermore, suppose there is CaF2 in it, then how? Is there a rule for the solubility of orthosilicate (H4SiO4), metasilicate (H2SiO3), disilicate (H6Si2O7), and trisilicate (H4Si2O8) (for HCl, H2SO4)? Which is easier and which is not easy?</p>
<p>—Lin Xueleng, Xinyie Chemical Factory—</p>
<p>We admire your great wish | | to work in the mine and pray for your success. The rich mineral resources in the Chinese mainland are in dire need of exploitation; however, this is not realized much because of the country's economic situation, and the lack of talent is also a very important reason. I have the following nine small opinions about your current study of mineralogy: (1) Scientific research is definitely not effective by "reading," especially mineralogy, which focuses on practical application. If you want to explore mineralogy, you must be in the position of being in contact with all kinds of minerals, you must go into the minerals to study and search, and you cannot just work in books. (2) Before specializing in mineralogy, you need to have general chemistry, general geology, and other knowledge related to mineralogy. These knowledge also need to be experienced on site. You are now studying chemistry, and you also have to do some geology work at the same time. (3) You asked where you can get the most confirmation from books. I think there is only one best, which is the only proof of what is said in the book, that is, to test it in the field. All scientific theories are based on experiments. We can only prove this theory by doing experiments. (4) The minerals mentioned in the book are indeed said to be in the form of tables. It does not mean that you should memorize them like you can memorize mathematical formulas, and you don't have to memorize mathematical formulas, but use them flexibly. The most important thing is to apply the experience and observations recorded by others in books to practice; regard it as a consultant for dealing with this matter, it is a reference. Why do we have to remember it firmly before we have confirmed what it says ourselves? When you observe more things and your experience is richer, you will naturally remember it firmly. It is a good way to understand minerals to collect various minerals and determine their qualitative analysis. However, the qualitative analysis of minerals is only a part of mineralogy. I hope you can "do it" step by step according to the steps in the book.</p>
<p>Regarding the questions you asked: (1) I checked several foreign specialized chemistry books for Larch Fungus Acid (Accid Agaricinicum), but I couldn't find it. I don't know if the English name is wrong or it's too specialized. (2) Since the streak of this limestone is yellow, it may contain sulfur or siderite, the original ore of ferrous carbonate FeCo3. Why don't you use your knowledge of analytical chemistry to do a qualitative analysis? When you have determined the composition of this limestone, then we can speculate why its ash turns into a dye after being hydrated; otherwise, isn't that a blind guess? Because the limestone you mentioned can be mixed with any other impurities, so to know the cause of its change, you must first know what it is made of. (3) The West Mountain and other places in Taihu Lake are limestone, and the west of Wu is mostly igneous rock. The location where these two types of rocks meet needs to be investigated in the field to be known. For this kind of small area, the stratum cannot be generalized as the entire stratum condition, so the geological survey reports of various places are usually based on the river basin and many related provinces. Coal seedlings are found in the area between the two (and there are coal mines in West Mountain, the relationship between them also needs to be investigated in the field to know. However, I am thinking like this: During the Paleozoic Carboniferous period, those places grew very tall fern plants, and later the earth's crust changed, and the ocean flooded those places. When the seawater receded, the silt in the seawater accumulated to become sedimentary rocks | | limestone is a kind of sedimentary rock | | , so the limestone and coal mines in West Mountain | | fern plants become coal. But the reason why there are many igneous rocks in the nearby Wu West, I guess is like this: After the sedimentary rocks are formed, but there are some large and small gaps in them, and these gaps are connected to the magma in the earth's crust, so the magma flows into these gaps and condenses into igneous rocks, which in geology is called intrusive strata (Intrusive Sheel). So there are many igneous rocks in Wu West. I wonder what you think. I don't know if Wu West is west of Suzhou or a mistake for Wuxi?</p>
<p>(4) You have to consult experts for the analysis of porcelain raw materials, we are not clear. But for the point that "the composition of the original mineral is the solubility of the silicate in the original mineral in sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid," I can explain as follows: Almost all substances have different solubility for the same solvent under the same temperature conditions. We already know the solubility of a certain silicate (such as silica, or potassium manganate, etc.) for a certain solvent, then we can naturally know what kind of silicate it is. Then we naturally know what kind of silicate is contained in this mineral. (5) The table you listed is too unclear to answer. You also didn't say clearly what solvent the solubility of silicon oxide is in. The solubility calculation of ordinary substances for a certain solvent is determined by evaporating a certain amount of its saturated solution and measuring the weight of the remaining solute. If the solution contains calcium fluoride, it must be removed by using their different properties or solubility, and then determined. (End)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Records of Fragrant Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Qingshan's felt hat also had a very elaborate decoration, which was the feather tube for inserting peacock feathers, which was also made of jade, but its style was almost the same as the most popular cigarette holder now.</p>
<p>My second brother's clothes were also roughly the same as Qingshan's, although he was the son of a duke and was also the heir to the title. The title was originally just a false name, what practical use was there? But looking at Qingshan, although he was also a first-rank official, he did not have any title, but he had the power to take charge of all government affairs in the palace and the court, as long as Li Lianying did not mess with him, he could do whatever he wanted. Therefore, in terms of real power, he was always bigger than my second brother anywhere. In fact, even the brothers of Emperor Guangxu did not have as much power as Qingshan! I dare to say categorically that I don't know how much value a false title can have? It's just that when our ancestors were first granted titles, it was because this person had indeed made many special merits and achievements that he could win this grace, and in the short moment when he began to receive the title, there was indeed a group of people who envied and flattered him: when he himself died, and his descendants inherited his title, others would no longer look at him especially because he was the descendant of a meritorious official.</p>
<p>My second brother's riding coat, mandarin jacket, and felt hat can be said to be exactly the same as Qingshan's, the only difference is the pair of buckles on the belt. His pair of buckles were made of 24K foreign gold, connected by three gold rings, tied with a very delicate fine chain. The weight of these three gold rings was very heavy, but they were polished very smoothly, and there were many patterns chiseled on them; my second brother liked to use the swastika, so his rings were chiseled with countless swastikas. Although most of this pair of buckles were made of gold, there were also several high-quality emeralds inlaid, so it was even better than Qingxi's. (32)</p>
<h3>Huguo Temple in Peiping</h3>
<p>— Sick Mandarin Duck</p>
<p>Outside Xibianmen in Beiping, more than 20 miles from the suburbs, there is a mountain called Babao, and behind the mountain is Huguo Temple, which occupies an area of about one qing. The most peculiar thing is that the temple worships neither Bodhisattvas nor real people; the abbot in the temple is neither a monk nor a Taoist priest. The incense and sacrifices received are all eunuchs, both above and below. According to legend, during the Ming Dynasty, when Prince Yan went on a northern expedition, a close attendant eunuch named Gang Tie died in battle near Babao Mountain. Therefore, a temple was built to worship him to commemorate his special achievements. Therefore, the last hall of the temple is still a Ming Dynasty building. The tombstone in the temple stands majestically, and although it has been eroded by wind and rain, the solemn image still remains. The statues in the main hall are extremely exquisite, and they are from the hands of Ming Dynasty sculptors. However, tourists and worshippers, looking at the remains, can tell at a glance that the god is a eunuch, because his attire is very obvious. In front of the statue are Chen Zhangyu's long iron fork and bows and arrows, etc. According to the living eunuchs in the temple, "These are the weapons used by Grandpa Gang on that day." Whether this statement is true or not is also impossible to verify. The murals on the left and right walls are painted in gold and drawn in plain colors, and the brushwork is extremely meticulous. They are all true depictions of Grandpa Gang's loyalty and bravery. However, the painter's interest in magic weapons for subduing monsters, etc., in the Investiture of the Gods and Journey to the West is too strong, which reduces the value of the true relics, which is a pity. A horizontal plaque is hung on the beam, saying "Flowers and Bamboo Qinghe," with the name "Pan Zuyin" signed below. According to Pan, a Wu native, was a master of Confucian classics and a famous minister in the late Qing Dynasty. He actually left his handwriting in this absurd realm, which shows the tyranny and theft of the eunuchs at that time. Pan, a university scholar who was expected at the time, still did not dare not to associate with them, and flattered them with writing. Under the steps of the main hall, a short stele is erected, engraved with the full text of the reconstruction of Huguo Temple, with Li Lianying, the favorite concubine of Empress Dowager Cixi, as the leader. The most recent abbot, Guo Yuwen, was originally a eunuch in charge of flowers and plants in the Yuanmingyuan of the Qing Palace. Currently, there are more than 30 supervisors in the temple, and about 60 other employees. The temple property has 68 hectares of fields, which is enough to support them. However, the youngest of them is nearly half a century old. It is said that thirty years later, the old supervisors will die one after another, and new supervisors will no longer be born, and this special Huguo Temple will not know how to transfer its jurisdiction? These public officials also think of this, and often sigh to the guests! And in the old imperial garden, there is no thought of the master.</p>
<h3>Talking about Living in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Everyone admits that Suzhou is a residential area with clear water and fertile soil. Because there are many ports, there are benefits of fish, shrimp, crabs, water chestnuts, lotus roots, and seasonal fresh food, which is a great pleasure to eat. And the cost of living is low, and everything is easy to cope with. The houses they live in are mostly inherited from their ancestors, often five or six entrances, with sedan hall, main hall, women's hall, flower hall, and various arrangements. There is often a garden in the back, where they grow vegetables, bamboo, trees, and raise chickens, which is very comfortable. Most of the owners have fields, two or three thousand mu for the more, and hundreds of mu for the less. By the beginning of winter in October, they set up stacks to collect rent. In the past, each mu could net eight or nine yuan after deducting grain tax, so those with two or three thousand mu would have more than 10,000 yuan in income, and those with hundreds of mu would also have several thousand yuan. The annual expenses can't be used up, and the remaining money can also be deposited in the village to lend out at interest. They live a leisurely life and don't talk about livelihood or worry about food and clothing. I really don't know how many lifetimes it took to cultivate such a happy fairy.</p>
<p>But the situation has changed drastically recently. Whether it is a famine year or a bumper year, the income has to be greatly discounted. Those landlords have felt the impact and are gradually becoming alarmed by the income not meeting the expenditure. However, Suzhou people have a strong sense of vanity. The arrangement is like this, and they cannot suddenly shrink it, giving people a joke. Since they cannot reduce expenditure, they have to start from the source of income and have to come to Shanghai to find a part-time job. They simply took their families and abandoned their hometown with clear water and fertile soil, and came to Shanghai, which is full of muskiness, to become retired officials. At the same time, general politicians, martial artists, celebrities, and scholars from other places have flocked to Suzhou to buy land and build houses as a plan for retirement. This trend is probably that in a few years, Suzhou will become a place for people from all over the world to enjoy themselves, and the real Suzhou people will be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Where is the Country?</h3>
<h3>A Moment Before Execution</h3>
<p>— Wang Dingjiu</p>
<p>Shanghai is a city of sin. Robbery, licentiousness, and evil, the social news pages of various newspapers, every day, heroes from all over the world come to perform. Police stations, courts, and prisons are overcrowded. Many people are sentenced to death. I am afraid that Fengdu City will also be overcrowded with ghosts (people call it population, ghosts can be called ghost population).</p>
<p>It's overflowing!</p>
<p>A prison car like a black bear was found on the road in West Shanghai again one morning, driving into the execution ground of Caohejing Prison. Wolf-like judicial police pushed each condemned prisoner to the desk of the dignified prosecutor like catching chickens. The prisoner suddenly raised his head and recognized the god of death in front of him, and his consciousness was blurred. The weak lowered their heads in despair, and the strong remained unyielding.</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Your old man will meet you again in twenty years."</p>
<p>The judges, pastors, and philanthropists who do favors for others have some regrets, admonishments, inquiries about their future, and repentance on their behalf in their solemn words. They also feed them sleeping pills so that they can wash away the sins of the past and numb the pain of the last moment.</p>
<p>The vermilion pen swooped down on the chopping list, and a blood flower was printed on his name, a prelude to his great bleeding in five minutes.</p>
<p>He lowered himself by half a section, like a Huishan man demanding goods from the south, and squatted down in a row. A white cloth covered his eyes, and the handgun was aimed at his head. The eight-character mustache of the dignified mouth spurted out a "go" word, and the judicial police who carried out the execution pulled the trigger "Ping! Pong!" several times, "The vermilion sign is the same color as the green blood, and the iron fetters sound together with the gunshots." A hero of the world has fallen to the ground like a scallion in the open space, alas!</p>
<p>Outside the wall, the families heard "Ping Pong," and the bullets seemed to drill into their own hearts. Parents cried, wives wept, and children wailed. Alas!</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 28 Coincidence of Watching the Venue,痴情拾帕 Diligent Questions Ask About the Disease Misunderstanding and Submitting a Letter Jiang said: It is right for neighbors in the neighborhood to do so. Ji Zhi nodded repeatedly and said: Old lady, please sit down, old lady, please sit down. Jiang took two steps back, far away from the bed. This was no way to reach out to steal the handkerchief, and it was not convenient for her to directly say to Ji Zhi that she was here to ask for the handkerchief, and asked if Ji Zhi had a fever and what he had eaten. Several thoughts arose in her heart, but she couldn't explain it. After sitting for more than ten minutes, she felt bored and left. But although she left, she absolutely couldn't let go of this matter in her heart. She was bored in her heart and walked in and out of the house, all thinking about how to get the handkerchief back. In the afternoon, she finally came up with an idea, so she wrapped ten persimmon cakes in a clay pot and came to Gan's house again. When she arrived at the door, she didn't see anyone, so she had to cough twice in the yard. But she heard Ji Zhi calling from the house: There's no one in the yard, old lady, please come in. Jiang walked into the study with the ten persimmon cakes in her hand, but she saw Ji Zhi holding the back of the chair and slowly standing up. Jiang said: Yo! You're up, why don't you rest more. Ji Zhi smiled and said: This cold comes like the wind and goes like the rain, it won't be long. Jiang smiled and said: I was in a hurry when I came in the morning, and I forgot. My relatives live in the mountains and sent me some persimmon cakes last winter. I picked a few clean ones and gave them to the second master. As she spoke, she put the persimmon cakes on the table. Ji Zhi said thank you again and again, and called Wang Ma twice to ask her to pour tea, because no one answered, he walked out of the study himself. Jiang thought this was an opportunity and didn't stop him. She sat on the bed, watching Ji Zhi's back, and when she saw him turn the corner, she immediately lifted the quilt on the bed to look for the handkerchief. She seemed to see something white under the mattress. Before she could tell what it was, she heard a rustling of footsteps outside the window. She immediately put down the quilt and sat on the edge of the bed. (383)</p>
<p>Where the Art Touches</p>
<h3>Travel Notes of Takarazuka</h3>
<p>— Jun Shang</p>
<p>I have heard people say that those who travel to Japan and have not reached Takarazuka have not completed their trip to Japan. The beauty of Takarazuka's mountains and rivers and the moving performances of the Girls' Revue are well-known in the Far East. I have traveled to this country for more than ten days, and I have always wanted to go to feast my eyes, but I have no time, and I am sad in my heart. On April 20, I went to Osaka with the Chinese Children's Education Association visiting group. I met my old friend Wu Zhongkang, who was stationed at the consulate in Osaka, and went to Takarazuka together to fulfill my long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>We took the tram from Osaka and reached our destination in 40 minutes. When we arrived, we saw layered mountains and peaks, and castles surrounded like barriers. On both sides of the river, hundreds of things filled the shops, and cherry blossoms lined the road. Listening to the silk and bamboo music, lingering in the alleys and buildings, stroking the scenery, I couldn't help but feel fascinated. Walking for four minutes, the new hot spring field is in sight. This is the center of Takarazuka's entertainment. All theaters, bathhouses, dining halls, zoos, botanical gardens, amusement parks, children's playgrounds, etc. are listed here. The ticket price is two horns, and you can visit freely except for watching the play.</p>
<p>The theaters are divided into three types: large, medium, and small. The small one is 30 feet wide and can accommodate 500 people. It is used for screening movies, acting, and gatherings on the third floor. The medium theater can accommodate 1,500 people, mostly performing new dramas and special performances. The large theater is on the bottom floor, which is the place where the Girls' Revue performs. It is 90 feet wide and can accommodate 4,000 people. The Japanese call it the number one public entertainment venue in the East. The ticket prices are the same, all three horns. Most of them are purchased several days in advance. Those who go to watch on the day often hug the corner. I rely on the help of Mr. Jun to reserve a seat in advance, so I can enter the seat calmly. The order in the venue is just so-so. The audience is women, carrying children and holding babies, as if in our country. There were three plays on that day, one was the Spring Dance, one was the Red Plum Hall, and one was the Western play Torantott, combining the forms and contents of China, the West, and Japan, and showing their comparative strengths and weaknesses unconsciously. The application of electric power in the scenery and the number of actors are worth watching. All the girls are healthy, but there are not many who want to see the bright teeth of a beautiful girl with misty hair. The art performed is still passable. These people are all students of the Takarazuka Girls' Revue School. The 380 people are divided into three groups and perform in rotation to practice. I will write about this kind of school when I have the opportunity.</p>
<p>After the examination, Takarazuka originally belonged to the poor chat, located between Osaka and Kobe. In the 43rd year of Meiji (1911), the Hanshin Express Electric Railway Company began to pioneer and remove thorns in this area, and opened bathhouses. The following year, it built the Girls' Revue Theater. In the 12th year of Taisho (1923), it was destroyed by Zhu Rong. The company rebuilt it and completed it in a short time. By now, the poor village has been modernized. Alas, the same sun and moon, the same mountains and rivers, but what people get is like this.</p>

<p>Special Issue No. 3 of the 11th Far Eastern Games Strong</p>
<h3>Our Country's Volleyball Defeats Japan on the Second Day of the Far Eastern Games, the Tennis Championship Will Be Decided by Japan and the Philippines, Japan's Football Loses to Dutch India, Basketball Loses to the Philippines, Our Country's Football and Volleyball Have Heavy Tasks Today, Football Against Dutch India, Volleyball Against the Philippines</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the 10th Far Eastern Games. Manila was overjoyed, no less than the opening day. Interest was focused on the volleyball match between China and Japan, the football match between the Netherlands and Japan, and the basketball match between the Philippines and Japan. The good news came that our country's volleyball team did overcome Japan. Unfortunately, the referee made trouble, saying that there was an error in our country's technique, which will not be difficult to clarify in the future. This time, the Philippine referee's lack of ability, as evidenced by the previous football match, etc., is a pity. The Dutch East Indies football team defeated Japan 7-1. Although on the one hand people are happy, the high level of technology in Dutch India makes our people have to guard against it. The Philippines defeated Japan 51-35 in basketball, which is equal to the ratio of our country's victory over Japan, which has greatly increased our country's basketball hopes. Tennis has been hopeless, and the championship will be firmly in the hands of the Japanese. It is unfortunate that our country cannot reach the final. The defeat in baseball was expected. Today's program is that our country's volleyball team will play against the Philippines, and the football team will play against Dutch India, both of which are critical moments. Especially football, the gain or loss of the championship is at stake.</p>
<h3>Popularity Reaches a Fever Pitch</h3>
<p>(Via Telecom, Manila, 13th) The Far Eastern Games, where athletes from four nations compete for the honor of their motherland, entered its second day today. Popularity reached a fever pitch. Despite the heat exceeding 95 degrees, no one seemed to mind. Tens of thousands of spectators from China, Japan, and the Philippines flocked to Rizal Park. An hour before the start of the competitions, most of the stands were already filled, the spectacle no less impressive than yesterday. The competitions began at 3 PM with a China-Japan baseball game, the China-Japan-Philippines-Netherlands tennis semi-finals, and a China-Japan volleyball game. The cheers from each nation's cheering squads were intense, leading to an even more heated battle than the previous day. Tens of thousands of spectators held their breath to see who would emerge victorious.</p>
<h3>Torrential Rain Last Night</h3>
<p>(Via Japanese United Press, Manila, 13th) The pistol shooting competition began at 7 AM on the second day of the games at the Yacht Club. By 10 AM, the general competition venue was filled with spectators. A military band played music to enliven the atmosphere, and each nation's cheering squad waved their national flags in a show of support. (Via Telecom, Manila, 13th) The weather in Manila, the land of perpetual summer, has been scorching for days, consistently above 95 degrees. Yesterday afternoon, however, dark clouds suddenly gathered, hinting at rain. Around 11 PM, a torrential downpour finally arrived, bringing instant coolness. As a result, there were concerns that the various competitions on the 13th might be difficult to hold. This morning, the skies suddenly cleared, and the heat returned to over 90 degrees, posing no obstacle to the competitions. At 7:30 AM, a small motorboat performed a public demonstration, and the shooting club also began the pistol shooting competition.</p>
<h3>Deciding the Winner in Five Sets: Our Nation's Volleyball Team Defeats Japan. After the Match, the Referee Suddenly Raises a Technical Error Protest, Claiming That Chen Baoqiu's Substitution Was Not Registered in Advance, Xu Minhui Refutes, Stating That Chen Was Registered in the Morning</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Manila, This Newspaper, 13th) In today's China-Japan volleyball match, China defeated Japan with a score of three to two. The scores were 21-18, 13-21, 21-16, 10-21, and 21-14. At the start of the fourth set, Chen Baoqiu was substituted into the Chinese team. After the match concluded, the referee suddenly declared that there were issues with the match, due to a technical error protest. Our nation's coach, Xu Minhui, immediately questioned the referee, who claimed that Chen Baoqiu's substitution was illegal because it was not registered. China even lost to Japan during the fourth set when Chen Baoqiu was substituted. According to Xu Minhui, Chen Baoqiu's substitution had already been registered in the morning. Since the referee allowed Chen Baoqiu to enter the court, why would the referee then claim that his substitution was illegal? Furthermore, the registration of Chen Baoqiu in the morning was done at the general office, and the referee apparently did not know about it beforehand. In short, the incompetence of the Philippine referees is a major problem. Even in last night's China-Japan basketball match, the actual score was 42 to 26, but the referee declared it as 42 to 27. The visiting team's scorekeeper also had no seat, leading to a multitude of errors, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 13th) After the China-Japan volleyball match, the Japanese side protested, claiming that Chen Baoqiu was not on our team's roster. They were unaware that Chen had registered immediately after our team arrived in the Philippines. The executive committee will discuss this matter on the 14th. Our side has sufficient grounds, so there should be no problem.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 13th) The China-Japan volleyball match began at 3 PM on the 13th. The lineups for both sides were as follows:</p>
<h3>The First Set Victory Comes With Difficulty</h3>
<p>Our team served first, losing two consecutive points. The score then became 3-1. We then scored three consecutive points, surpassing the Japanese team. Xu Heng and Qiu Guangxie frequently attacked and displayed their skills, gaining a lead of 11-7. After switching sides, the game was quite exciting. When Japan narrowed the gap to 18-17, Cao Tingzan served, earning two points. Qiu Guangxie then delivered a powerful spike, securing the first set with a score of 21-18.</p>
<h3>The Second Set's Disorganized Lineup</h3>
<p>At the start of the second set, Japan scored three consecutive points. We gradually became disorganized, falling behind 10-3. Xu Heng's serve earned three points, and we switched sides at 11-6. Our side still showed no improvement. At 14-8, Huang Yingjie replaced Chen Xibing. Qiu Guangxie's two spikes against the enemy's formation boosted the morale. Huang Yingjie also scored with a powerful spike, making it 16-12. However, he was injured due to excessive force and was replaced by Chen Xibing again. We ultimately lost to Japan with a score of 13-21.</p>
<h3>Third Set: Relief after Suffering</h3>
<p>Japan scored first in the third set. Tan Yongzhan's serve earned three consecutive points. Japan also worked hard to surpass us with a score of 4-3. The score then became tied multiple times, making the situation quite tense. Finally, we won a point, and we grew stronger and more aggressive, narrowing the gap to 13-11. Xu Heng then delivered two smashes, making the score 17-13. Qiu Guangxie and Cao Tingzan, in a moment of inspiration, followed with brilliant strikes, securing victory with a score of 21-16.</p>
<h3>Games Medals</h3>
<h3>Fourth Set: Utter Helplessness</h3>
<p>Japan scored two points first in the fourth set. Although we made some contributions, we failed to catch up and switched sides with a score of 13-4. Chen Baoqiu replaced Tan Yongzhan, but we still could not recover and lost with a score of 21-10.</p>
<h3>Fifth Set: The Japanese Army in Disarray</h3>
<p>The fifth set was the deciding factor. Both sides were cautious and composed. Tan Yongzhan replaced Chen Baoqiu again. Japan scored three points first. After 9-5, our side made steady progress, tying the score and surpassing them by one point after switching sides. Our momentum greatly increased, and we powerfully spiked the ball with excellent cooperation. The score soared, and the Japanese team was in disarray, unable to cope. At 20-13, Japan scored one point. Qiu Guangxie then delivered the final blow, making the final score 21-14. The final scores were: China 21-18, 13-21, 21-16, 10-21, 21-14; Japan.</p>

<p>After each side scored one point in the second set, we created a 4-2 lead, which could have been easily expanded. However, the referee's oversight caused the players to become flustered, and the Philippines surpassed us with a score of 11-6.

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Issues Order Announcing Ministry of Education's Regulations for Public-Private Jointly Run Elementary Schools</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Education Department's order states: Upon investigation, elementary schools in various counties of this province often have primary grades established by public entities while higher grades are established by private individuals or private legal entities. In the early stages when public finances were insufficient, the enthusiasm of private individuals to generously contribute and benefit students was originally commendable. However, due to the commingling of public and private funds, jurisdiction is often difficult to unify, and since conditions vary in each county, the methods also differ accordingly. Recognizing this situation, this Department should promptly establish unified methods to avoid disputes. After detailing the circumstances in a report and submitting it to the Ministry of Education for approval, Instruction No. 4922 of the Ministry of Education states, "The report is noted. These elementary schools should be allowed to exist or be established to benefit education. As for the title of the school, the competent education administration authority should consult with the private individuals making donations to decide it. In principle, if the public funds component is larger, the school may be called a County/District Public Elementary School. Conversely, it may be called a Private Elementary School with public funds serving as a subsidy. However, if it is called a Private Elementary School, it should comply with the regulations for private schools in setting up a board of directors composed of public and private individuals in proportion to the funds contributed, electing several directors from each, and appointing a principal to run the school in accordance with the regulations. If it is called a County/District Public Elementary School, there is no need to set up a separate board of directors; it should be run in accordance with the regulations for County/District Public Elementary Schools. However, the donor may suggest to the education administration authority plans for running the school for the education administration authority to reference. You are hereby informed." etc. Having received this, in addition to issuing separate orders, we hereby forward this order to you for your information and for you to follow these regulations in managing these schools and to report back for verification. This order.</p>

<h3>Further Explanation of Mr. Song Guobin's Ideal Chinese Medical Association</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>In the last issue, this publication published an article by Mr. Song Guobin, titled "Ideal Chinese Medical Association," which essentially stated that new doctors in our country are still divided into factions. Invisibly, two major associations and one professional organization are controlled by figures from various factions, resulting in inconsistent policies and differing opinions among the associations. Only by unifying the associations and forming a large united organization can the future of new medicine be developed.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that some of what Mr. Song said is completely true, and there are sufficient reasons for the medical community to unite. However, this is only a matter for doctors to discuss among themselves, not something for doctors to discuss with society. However, since Mr. Song has published this article in the Shen Bao, I must further explain Mr. Song's article so that society has a clearer understanding of the medical community, because the unity of the medical community in the future may require external assistance.</p>
<p>In my view, the so-called factional issue is not a clear and obvious title that our medical community uses itself, but is half given to us by society. I think Mr. Song repeatedly mentioned British, American, German, and Japanese factions in his article, but I suspect that Mr. Song was only following the habits of society and writing accordingly, and did not necessarily definitively recognize the factional names.</p>
<p>The origin of this customary name comes from only two sources: one is that those who study new medicine, whether they study abroad or in the country, have a relationship with the application of foreign languages; the other is that they regard academics and goods as one, which is a major problem for Chinese people.</p>
<p>After the Chinese Restoration, everything relied on imported goods, which were called foreign goods. Unfortunately, medicine was also regarded as foreign goods by society, and naturally, like cloth, it was divided into Russian flower labels and indanthrene blue cloth, following the times and allowing customers to choose. Since doctors regard opening a practice and selling their skills as the only way to make a living, this trend is bound to be created. It is no wonder that a group of doctors in the past, in order to adapt to the psychology of society, labeled themselves as German doctors, French doctors, and American doctors. From that time on, this habit was formed, and a concept of factionalism was nurtured. In fact, British and American students have never concluded any secret agreements, and doctors who use German and Japanese have never signed any agreements.</p>
<p>As for the establishment of various academic associations and professional organizations, it was long after this habit had formed, so it was definitely not that figures from various factions went to control an organization, but rather that the organizations were formed by the efforts of various factions. It was an accidental formation, not an intentional occupation; moreover, running organizational affairs inevitably sacrifices a lot of mental and material resources.</p>
<p>Judging from past events, I dare to prove that the major policies of the new medical organizations are all the same. At most, there are some differences in habitual actions, local methods, or the principles of one or two people. It is not that there are differences of opinion and that they form cliques to attack dissidents, so unity is not difficult.</p>
<p>However, in a nutshell, the medical community and society should bear in mind that we should "start from the national concept and seek the independence of Chinese academics."</p>
<p>Culture should only be absorbed, how can academics be sold? However, China's new culture is all subject to the intrusion of foreign forces, not actively adopted, almost like the dumping of foreign goods. The degree of aggression also shifts with the power of the great powers in the world. If people in the academic community leave the national concept, then Chinese talents are like foreign goods; wouldn't the schools opened by foreigners in China become like the yarn factories opened by the Japanese in Shanghai and the cigarette companies opened by the British in Shanghai?</p>
<p>If the academic community still does not realize it, and the general public still regards medicine as goods, then, to tell a joke, Mr. Song's ideal Chinese medical association is just the Chinese Foreign Cloth Industry Association, not a domestic goods market. Look at the traditional doctors making a fuss about the National Medical Museum, which is full of sound and fury, isn't it like promoting the national goods movement for local cloth? Therefore, my ideal Chinese medical association should start from the basis of academic independence and be built by the scientific medicine of the times. What does Mr. Song think?</p>

<p>Take two to three spoonfuls of oatmeal or rolled oats, add one quart of water, steam for twenty to thirty minutes (the same amount of rice must be steamed for forty minutes), then sieve through a fine sieve, add a little salt, and add water to one quart.</p>
<p>Sometimes flour can be used instead of oatmeal, and famous milk substitutes sold on the market can also be used, but it must be with the doctor's consent, otherwise, it is easy to have accidents.</p>
<p>2.  Method of Preparing Milk Paste:</p>
<p>Milk 100 kg (3.5 ounces)</p>
<p>Water 100 kg</p>
<p>Wheat paste 1 spoonful</p>
<p>Butter 1 teaspoon</p>
<p>Sugar 2 teaspoons</p>
<p>Mix the above ingredients and cook for ten minutes.</p>
<p>3.  Method of Preparing Vegetable Soup.</p>
<p>Vegetables can be green vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, cauliflower, etc.</p>
<p>Sieved cooked vegetables 100 kg</p>
<p>Butter 2 teaspoons</p>
<p>Flour 15 kg</p>
<p>Vegetable juice 100 kg</p>
<p>Milk 100 kg</p>
<p>A little salt</p>
<p>Babies like to eat sweet foods, so it is difficult for mothers to get children who are used to soup to tend to eat vegetables again. But even if they don't want to eat harder things, they should at least be asked to eat some every day.</p>
<p>These new foods, especially vegetables, are digested very slowly in the intestines, and mothers should pay attention to the fact that after the baby has eaten green vegetables, they are excreted in the stool and still retain their original color. But this does not mean that you should not continue to eat them, unless the baby has diarrhea or other symptoms, then you should not continue to eat vegetables.</p>
<p>After the seventh month, the baby can have one meal of vegetables and two meals of porridge or milk paste every day, which is part of the solid food.</p>
<p>When the baby's first tooth comes out, foods like fried pancakes can be given to him. Meat and eggs can only be eaten after the age of one year.</p>
<p>The development of a properly nourished baby is roughly as described below.</p>
<p>The average weight of a newborn baby is 7.1 pounds, but boys are heavier by 200 grams.</p>
<p>The weight gain of the baby is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>One month after birth, the weight doubles compared to when it was first born.</p>
<p>After one year, the weight is three times the birth weight. In the second half of the second year, the weight gain is not very accurate, but this does not necessarily mean that the baby is sick. The length of a newborn baby is roughly from twenty to twenty-one inches, and it can grow nine inches in the first year, and four inches more in the second year. By the fourth year, it will be twice as tall as when it was born.</p>
<p>The baby's legs are initially tight, with his little hands stretched upwards. In the third month, the head can be straightened a little, and soon after, it can be completely straightened. After the fifth month, he has already started to learn to sit. By the sixth and seventh months, he is crawling on the ground and gradually able to stand. After one year, he begins to learn to walk. Naturally, his steps are unstable and alarming. Babies with rickets should not be made to walk too early, because the bones are weak, which often leads to strange postures of bent legs and knees.

<h3>Common Sense Questions and Answers about Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(28) Erysipelas</p>
<p>(Q) What is erysipelas?</p>
<p>(A) Erysipelas is a traumatic infectious disease caused by the invasion of pyogenic streptococci after minor trauma to the skin or mucous membranes. It is commonly called "streaming fire"; the Western name is Erysipelas. (Q) How is erysipelas spread?</p>
<p>(A) It is spread directly from the patient to healthy people or indirectly through instruments and air. However, the patient must first have a predisposing factor for erysipelas in the body.</p>
<p>(Q) Can you get immunity after suffering from erysipelas?</p>
<p>(A) After suffering from erysipelas, the patient does not gain immunity; on the contrary, there is a tendency to increase the predisposing factor. That is, it often becomes habitual erysipelas.</p>
<p>(Q) How many days after contracting erysipelas does it take to develop the disease?</p>
<p>(A) It takes one to three days of incubation to develop the disease.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of the whole body when the disease occurs?</p>
<p>(A) The whole body suddenly starts with chills, tremors, and fever; after a few hours to one or two days, skin lesions appear.</p>
<p>(Q) Which part of the body is most susceptible to erysipelas?</p>
<p>(A) It is the face (due to nasal erosion, razor injuries, etc.) and the head (scratching).</p>
<p>(Q) What are the local symptoms of the disease?</p>
<p>(A) The skin of that part becomes red and swollen, with light drop, burning heat, pain, itching and a feeling of tension. The degree of such inflammation has a tendency to go down sharply. However, parts where the subcutaneous tissue is tight are not extended, such as the philtrum, groin, and tibial margin. The lymph glands near the local part of erysipelas are swollen and painful. This occurs at its extreme two to three days after the onset of the disease; then it fades in order.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any other symptoms?</p>
<p>(A) Yes, such as stubborn headaches, restlessness, excitement, delirium, drowsiness, and other brain symptoms; and loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and moderate splenomegaly.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the complications of erysipelas?</p>
<p>(A) Complications include purulent meningitis, purulent otitis media, acute hemorrhagic nephritis, and occasionally septicemia, endocarditis, pericarditis, bronchitis, or skin abscesses. It can even induce skin gangrene. In addition, there is also elephantiasis of the skin caused by repeated erysipelas. (Q) How can erysipelas be diagnosed?</p>
<p>(A) It can be diagnosed only from systemic fever, limited redness, swelling, pain, and the tendency of the skin to spread.</p>
<p>(Q) How dangerous is this disease?</p>
<p>(A) Most are good. But it is not good for newborns, puerperal women, and people with heart failure. The mortality rate is five to ten percent.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the treatment for erysipelas?</p>
<p>(A) Apply oil-based mineral oil or ichthammol ointment locally.</p>
<p>Or use an ice pack or cold wet cloth to wrap it. In addition, injections of anti-streptococcal serum and colloidal silver solution are effective. For headaches and fever, take antipyretics such as "Phenacetin," "Antipyrine," and "Pyramidon." Use cardiac tonics such as camphor "Digalen" for heart failure.</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (4)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>(4) Contact transmission. The patient's clothes, bedding, eating utensils, sputum, excrement, and all utensils close to the patient can be infectious.</p>
<p>Of course, the above four paths are most closely related to pulmonary tuberculosis; especially the inhalation of air is the most likely to be infectious, it is ubiquitous and difficult to prevent, and on the other hand, it is extremely easy to be ignored. I hope that readers, whether they are already sick or not, should pay special attention to this point. In addition, kissing is very popular among couples and parents and children in Europe and the United States; on this point alone, there is the possibility of being attacked by tuberculosis bacteria! There is also the possibility that the vulva may be attacked. However, this kind of fact is relatively rare after all, and the evidence is not yet fully sufficient; therefore, I will omit it here. Finally, I think readers may still want to ask; can pulmonary tuberculosis be inherited from parents to children? In other words, is there congenital pulmonary tuberculosis? This question has not yet been fully answered to this day. We must know that there is ultimately no evidence to prove that tuberculosis bacteria are directly brought by the father's sperm to the mother's ovum, as is the case with syphilis. However, there is evidence that the fetus in the mother's body suffers from tuberculosis, because it is possible for tuberculosis bacteria to be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta. However, this kind of situation is very rare: it is not easy to find tuberculosis bacteria or tuberculous lesions in the placenta. This kind of possibility is mostly due to the mother's suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, and this disease can only succeed if it happens to be in the stage of continuous progress. Otherwise, of course, this will not happen.</p>
<p>Once tuberculosis bacteria are inhaled, do they remain fixed in the human body? This situation is uncertain. We must know that there is a kind of cilia on the mucous membrane of human tracheal branches, which is dedicated to the work of expelling phlegm; if the tracheal branch is completely healthy, then the tuberculosis bacteria can of course be expelled. However, sometimes too many tuberculosis bacteria invade, and they are excluded but cannot be excluded. There are also times when the mucous membrane of the tracheal branches is not fully capable, and at this time, of course, it cannot fully fulfill its responsibility of exclusion. Common bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, and other diseases easily lead to pulmonary tuberculosis afterwards, which is the reason.</p>
<h3>Temporary Treatment for External Bleeding</h3>
<p>— Ji Jilin</p>
<p>The heart is a conical, muscular, hollow organ. Its size varies from person to person. It is located in the chest between the fifth and sixth ribs, leaning towards the left. The common saying that the heart resides in the middle of the body is a misconception. Blood is the raw material for the body's nutrition, and the heart is the central machinery for its transportation. The tubes through which blood travels are called blood vessels. They are divided into arteries, veins, and capillaries. Vessels that carry blood from the heart to various parts of the body are called arteries. Vessels that carry blood from various parts of the body back to the heart are called veins. The vessels between arteries and veins are called capillaries.</p>
<p>Blood vessels are densely distributed throughout all parts of the body. Arteries, due to the rapid flow of blood, may occasionally be damaged, causing blood to spurt out and become difficult to stop, leading to blood loss. Therefore, arteries are usually located deep within the body, implicitly providing protection. Veins, on the other hand, are closer to the surface, appearing bluish-green. Their path can be traced on the skin. The "blue veins" commonly seen under the skin of laborers are veins. In our daily lives, we often come into contact with various things, and unexpected events are unavoidable. Therefore, occasional carelessness or sudden external force can cause injury to the body. Mild injuries may only cause skin discoloration, while severe injuries can affect deeper tissues, causing blood vessels to rupture and fresh blood to spurt out like a charging bull. If not stopped quickly, life is at stake. In cities, hospitals are abundant, making it easy to seek medical treatment. However, in remote areas with inconvenient transportation, people often die due to excessive blood loss because they cannot get medical attention in time. This article aims to provide temporary emergency measures for situations where medical attention is not readily available, which is slightly better than standing by helplessly. As mentioned above, there are three types of blood vessels. Therefore, external bleeding can also be arterial, venous, or capillary. These are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Arterial Bleeding: Arteries are highly elastic and their walls are dense and strong, making them difficult to rupture unless severely injured. Once ruptured, bright red blood spurts out in a radiating pattern. Furthermore, due to the heart's pulsation, bleeding occurs in a pulsating, on-and-off manner. (The heart's pulsation corresponds to the artery's contraction and relaxation.) If the injury is only to small vessels, the blood can often stop on its own due to the contraction of the vessel and pressure from surrounding tissues. However, if a major blood vessel is injured, immediate and appropriate treatment is necessary to prevent dangerous blood loss.</p>
<p>(2) Venous Bleeding: The blood is usually dark red in color. The blood flow is not rapid, and it slowly flows out of the vessel opening. Although bleeding from small veins is rarely dangerous, bleeding from major veins can be life-threatening and should be treated promptly.</p>
<p>(3) Capillary Bleeding: Also known as parenchymal bleeding, this involves blood flowing from numerous capillaries. The blood color is between that of arteries and veins. It is often seen on the tongue, lips, bones, and in vascular tumors. Due to blood clotting, it can often stop on its own. However, in patients with hemophilia, whose blood lacks clotting ability, even minor injuries can cause continuous bleeding, posing a danger. This disease is often inherited.</p>
<p>Long-term hemostasis methods, such as vascular ligation, antiseptic packing, vascular crushing, etc., must be performed by a doctor. Temporary hemostasis is an emergency measure. If arterial bleeding is identified, strongly press the upper part of the injury with your fingers. For venous bleeding, strongly press the lower part of the injury with your fingers. However, fingers cannot withstand long use and easily become fatigued. It is acceptable to wrap it with clean bandages. At the same time, tightly press the bleeding part to achieve the purpose of stopping the bleeding. If such bandages are not available, use clean pieces of cloth instead. Do not use unclean objects to compress the bleeding part, as this can lead to infection and adverse consequences. If the bleeding is in the limbs, in addition to the above methods, the limbs should also be raised high to assist in stopping the bleeding. If the injury is in the nose, causing nosebleeds, temporarily pinch the nostrils tightly and apply a cold water towel to the forehead and back of the neck. If this is still ineffective, insert cotton soaked in saline into the nasal cavity to stop the bleeding. For capillary bleeding, tightly press the wound surface with a clean bandage, and it can usually stop on its own. Recently, some have advocated using cold therapy on the injured area, which has also shown remarkable results. This involves immersing the bleeding part in sterilized cold water or wrapping it with ice packs. This utilizes the cold stimulus to cause the blood vessels at the injury site to contract, thereby achieving the purpose of stopping the bleeding. However, its effect is temporary, as the blood vessels will re-expand once the cold water or ice pack is removed, and blood will continue to flow out. To remedy this, wrap the area with warm water after removing the cold water or ice pack to promote blood clotting. This is because blood clotting requires a certain temperature. While cold therapy can rapidly constrict blood vessels, blood is difficult to clot under extreme cold. Therefore, when using cold therapy for bleeding, warm therapy must follow.</p>
<p>In addition to the methods described above, there are also medications that can be used to stop bleeding. Commonly used is hydrogen peroxide solution, as it has the effect of coagulating blood. This solution is usually applied to the bleeding area with cotton or gauze. However, this medicine is sometimes ineffective. There is also dry hemostatic cotton, which is made by soaking cotton in hydrogen peroxide solution. Additionally, alum water, adrenaline solution, etc., also have hemostatic effects. We may want to keep some in stock to prepare for the unexpected.</p>
<h3>On the Treatment of Syphilis (Can 606 and 914 Completely Cure Syphilis?) (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shen Gong</p>
<p>Since the opening of maritime trade, social interactions have increased. Various diseases have advanced along with these interactions. Many young people serve society and frequent places of pleasure due to socializing. As a result, the number of people contracting venereal diseases has gradually increased, with syphilis being the most prevalent. This is because it is not only transmitted through contact but also inherited by offspring.</p>
<p>The treatment of syphilis includes both local and systemic therapies. Treatment is primarily the responsibility of doctors. However, in this era of medical confusion, patients have a particular need to understand these treatments. Therefore, this article dares to address the public to discuss it. Today, the drugs used for systemic treatment of syphilis are generally four: mercury preparations, arsenic preparations, bismuth preparations, and iodine preparations. Other treatments, such as gold preparations and malaria therapy, will be discussed at a later date.</p>
<p>(1) Mercury Therapy: This is the oldest method and was the most popular before the discovery of 606. Although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, once the drug enters the body, it combines with proteins and penetrates into the blood and lymph, stimulating cells in the body and directly inhibiting the growth of pathogens. Mercury preparations can be administered through topical application, injection, and oral ingestion. However, they have many side effects, such as stomatitis, gingivitis, colitis, nephritis, dermatitis, and polyneuritis. In addition, injection can cause pain and hard lumps. Therefore, today, except when slow-acting therapies are used for neurological and severe syphilis, people generally only use topical application and oral ingestion.</p>
<p>(2) Arsenic Therapy: Four hundred years ago, arsenic preparations were already being used to treat syphilis. In [year missing], Ehrlich [names missing] discovered 606, [names missing] This drug is effective regardless of the stage of the disease. It not only directly affects the pathogens but also does not have the severe destructive effects of mercury. This is closest to the ideal of chemical therapy. There are many types of 606, including old 606 (Dioxy-diamidoarsenobenzoum), commonly known as 606. There is new 606, also known as 914, which is Nat formaldehyde sulfoxylate manufactured Nat dihydroxydiaminoarsenobexolmonoformaldehydsuloxylate. There are also 606 sodium, 606 silver (a black powder), and Myosalvarsan Acetylase, which is injected intramuscularly. Oral 606 is a white preparation, such as Spirioed (tablets) and Srovasol (Hoechst) (white powder). However, the effectiveness of oral 606 is still questionable.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned arsenic preparations have many uses, and [unclear] also play a role. Vascular nerve [unclear], immersion [unclear], [names missing] reaction [unclear] blood [unclear] jaundice and skin rashes. However, current injection methods [unclear]. This phenomenon is now rare.</p>

<h3>On the Beining Railway Line</h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>Speaking of Beijing, a poet has a poem in mind, an artist has a painting on paper, and ordinary people will not forget that there [are what missing], there are eunuchs, and some pot-bellied people will reminisce about the past prosperity of the Eight Great Alleys there.</p>
<p>Taking the Beining train, leaving this place of "Beijing accent," in less than twenty minutes, desolation appeared on both sides of the tracks. From Beijing to Tianjin, it is like from Nanjing to Shanghai, although there is not one-thousandth of the prosperity on the Beining line as on the Jinghu line. What is more worth mentioning, for example, Yangcun Station is famous for selling "Yanggan" (a type of dried bean curd), but express trains do not stop there.</p>
<p>Around Yangliuqing, the roadside is often flooded with water in summer, and frozen into silvery-white ice in harsh winter. After the eyes are filled with water for a while, Tianjin arrives.</p>
<p>On the train, one can first see that silted-up inner river, the water color mixed and yellow, the masts of small sailboats like clusters of aquatic shrubs. Small steamships twist laboriously in the heart of the river, and the cargo is sometimes quite crowded, but they are all marked with foreign characters.</p>
<p>Tianjin does not have as many chimneys as Wuxi!</p>
<p>The poor are as numerous as ants lined up on the hot ground. Just like what Yu Dafu called the kind of people who "cannot make a living but dare not die," wearing torn gowns, torn military uniforms, torn blue shirts, torn thermal underwear, rolling their eyes at the rushing train, women with muddy faces begging for leftovers, while still coquettishly smiling. Oh yes, they are also wearing pink foreign socks.</p>
<p>By the railway, there are ponds formed by sewage, with colors of yellow, green, purple, and brown. Next to the pond is a garbage dump and a layer of coal dust. Sinclair's description in "The Jungle" is universal. The filth of the pond and the children next to the pond, with the stench fumigating, Chicago and Tianjin are no different!</p>
<p>The carriages on the Beining Railway are famous. One train was prepared for the League of Nations Investigation Team in the past, and now it is still in Qinhuangdao for tour groups to ride. Frankly speaking, the third-class carriages of the Beining Railway are not too bad, in the north. On the train, you can hear the waiters of Tianjin Wei persuading people to drink tea with a Tianjin Wei accent. Tianjin people are like Tianjin radishes, crisp and spicy!</p>
<p>The roadside trees along both sides of the tracks are more neat and tidy on the Beining line. In summer, the shade reflects on the train, making the passengers feel cool. For [unclear], the Volunteers outside Shanhaiguan were once active on this railway line, but as a result, most of them were chopped down. As the train arrives at Tangshan, it travels slower, and people always have a kind of illusion, feeling that the ground is hollow, and the train shakes so that there is an echo from the center of the earth. But in fact, it is somewhat believable. The mines of the Kaiping Mining Bureau spread like a net in the heart of the earth. It is not surprising that some places are already empty. Some people are worried that Tangshan will sink!</p>
<p>Tangshan is now said to have a bit of a "three-no-care" phenomenon. Pawnshops accepting living people as pledges is no longer a rare event, and there are also a large number of human traffickers in Tangshan trading in flesh. As the northern country is just getting warmer, the grass is just green, the wheat is just sprouting leaves, and the ground has not yet been covered, the traces of war and bloodstains along the line are not difficult for discerning people to discover. If you arrive in "Manchukuo" and no longer say that you are "Chinese," then life may be safe. The Beining line is rich in internationalism!</p>
<h3>Dignity</h3>
<p>— Lü Jun</p>
<p>A person should feel self-respect, especially students who have received higher education. For example, the boys of Eton College in England have a noble demeanor. In the past, the students of Chinese academies also had an awe-inspiring presence and a sense of responsibility for "the world," feeling that they were at the top of the four classes of people. Society highly respected and treated them favorably.</p>
<p>It is said that in European countries, students are treated very favorably. Scholarships are very common, the learning environment is good, and college students get special discounts for shopping, going to the theater, and medical treatment. They are free in society, and no one dares to infringe on them.</p>
<p>But surprisingly, in Beijing, the authorities invited female university students to entertain foreign guests, and they had to practice etiquette beforehand to avoid being improper, and to accompany foreign dignitaries to dance and tour the gardens. Of course, this time the authorities ran into a snag. Not only did the female university students not go, but most of the foreign guests also did not go.</p>
<p>We usually commemorate national humiliation, and many times it is only foreign aggression, but this kind of thing actually comes from the government, which can really be considered a shame for the government. "Sleeping on firewood and tasting gall" is originally absurd, and the slogan of "recovering lost territory" is no longer heard. The authorities want our female university students to accompany Japanese officials to dance and visit the Summer Palace, which shows that it is not without reason, but a consistent principle. Since the May Fourth Movement, hasn't there been a frequent call for "popular sentiment"? Whenever popular sentiment is slightly depressed, the authorities perform strange dramas, one act after another. Although Western customs can scare the common people, we have never heard of the Mayor of London sending female students from the University of London to "entertain" foreign guests from Germany and France on a garden tour; nor have we seen female students from the University of Berlin dancing with the French, even in their misfortune. Only recently did Tokyo have a garden party to entertain officials from "Manchukuo," with young girls singing and dancing, which is a trick that only the Japanese can pull off. But even at its most despicable, there were no female students from the Imperial University.</p>
<p>Although Yenching University has also raised questions, these officials who have lost face will never admit their mistakes. "Daughters belong to every family, and it is truly heartbreaking," so in the past, female students shed blood at the entrance of [missing word], and later there were also old women from Sanhe County who beat "毛丫头" (Mao Yatou, a derogatory term for young girls), these are all past events. Today, the past, and the present are like this, which shows that the future may not be different.</p>
<p>When students become desolate and lose their nobility and dignity in society, the future of this nation becomes even gloomier.</p>
<h3>Lu Yin is Dead</h3>
<p>— Liu Dajie</p>
<p>Ms. Huang Lu Yin, a writer who wrote novels in vernacular Chinese eleven years ago and whose works had achieved a considerable position in the literary world at that time, passed away today (May 13th) at 11:20 AM in Room 14 of Dahua Hospital.</p>
<p>What an amazing and tragic piece of news! For the relatives and friends of Ms. [missing word], as well as for the [missing word] who loved to read Lu Yin's works but had never met her. Thinking about it, life is really a dream, really like a wisp of smoke. Six or seven days ago, a lively and healthy, happy and kind Lu Yin, in a dim ward today, with a withered and sorrowful face, bid farewell to this world, to this society, to friends like us, in painful cries.</p>
<p>This time, she really died unjustly. In Shanghai, a city with a high degree of scientific civilization and material civilization, she was killed by a doctor with no scientific knowledge. When a woman gives birth to a child, no matter how difficult the labor is, it is very difficult for a person to die in today's advanced medicine, let alone when she did not have a difficult labor. It was just that they used surgery indiscriminately, injured the uterus, and caused excessive bleeding. By the time she was sent to Dahua Hospital, she was already barely breathing. After many doctors' rescue efforts, there was ultimately no way. Under the care of several friends, she painfully closed her eyes to eternal sleep.</p>
<p>I and Lu [missing word] had a friendship of seven or eight years. In the last three years, we lived in Shanghai and interacted more frequently. We often played cards, drank, and ate together. We talked about almost everything, as if we were siblings. Her personality was extremely strong. On the surface, she was an optimist, but inside she was an extremely pessimistic person. In these four years, because she found a gentle Wei Jian, a poet of optimism, she finally gained a little comfort in her spiritual life. I didn't expect their enviable married life to end so abruptly.</p>
<p>She left behind two daughters, one ten years old and one three years old. The younger child seemed to have no sense of the sorrow and horror of death at all. When her mother was dying, she was holding a Florida orange in her hand and was clamoring to peel it!</p>
<p>Regarding Lu Yin's life, I think Wei Jian will definitely have an article recording it. Regarding her works and her friendship with our couple, in a couple of days, I would like to draft a more detailed memoir.</p>
<p>For her funeral, Wei Jian was completely immersed in deep sorrow and could not move, so Shu Xincheng and I had to take responsibility. The coffin-sealing ceremony is scheduled for 6:00 PM on May 14th (Monday). I hope her relatives and friends and those who love to read her works will come to the China Funeral Home on Haig Road to see her tragic face after death.</p>
<h3>What Books Should Children Read?</h3>
<p>— Maxim Gorky, translated by Zuo Qi</p>
<p>That is to say, we must liberate children from the traditional and customary ways of thinking, from the fallacies of the old ways of life based on class struggle, from the individual's attempts to survive, and from the fallacy of confirming individualism and nationalism as immutable principles of human society.</p>
<p>From the early years of childhood, they must be made to abandon everything from the past, even in the matter of games. To do this, we must not only make them understand historical events, past ideologies and doctrines, but also explain how these events and doctrines arose from the general production process of a particular society. We must point out that freedom of thought can only be achieved when people are completely free to engage in the work necessary for life, a situation that has never been widespread before, but is a fundamental state under socialism.</p>
<p>So-called immutable facts often have a conservative effect, limiting thinking to obvious internal matters, thereby dulling and hindering understanding. But Marx has shown that facts themselves are creative. He has clearly pointed out that the root cause of human tragedy and suffering lies in the artificial [missing word] existing in the nimble hands and minds of laborers.</p>
<p>We must show children how humanity has evolved from a hazy past and its initial semi-conscious life forms. Be sure to let them know a little about the journey from the inventor of the stone ax to Stephenson and Diesel (inventor of the diesel engine), from the founders of absurd fairy tales to the doctrines that have shown us the path to a bright life. As children enter a new world, a world where technology reduces labor, and a classless society, they should know the importance of physical labor and how workers change the face of nature and create a new environment, a "second nature."</p>
<p>At the same time, let them know: if the freedom of human spontaneous labor had not been shackled and restricted by the selfishness and greed of the ruling classes throughout history, humanity would have infinitely surpassed the current stage of general culture.</p>
<p>Capable humans are creating a "second nature," a new cultural environment; humans are the agents of nature, [missing words] and transforming and creating them: This meaning must be deeply imprinted in children's minds. Therefore, to make children understand life, one must start with stories about ancient times, about the origins of human labor, and the development of thought.</p>
<p>To create an artistic and educational children's literature, it is necessary to first cultivate talented writers who can simply, [missing word] and beneficially express their thoughts; it is necessary to first cultivate well-trained editors with political and literary foundations; in addition, there must be publishing convenience.</p>
<p>Precisely because all of this work cannot be accomplished overnight, we must begin to proceed at this time. It may be helpful to disclose a few themes that must be paid attention to in creating a new children's literature at this time.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the following outline can be obtained: The Earth; Air; Water; Plants; Animals; How humans appeared on Earth; How humans develop their thoughts; How humans control the use of fire; How humans try to reduce labor and the burden of life; What is the relationship between the control of iron and other metals and humans; The miracles of science; Thought and behavior; Future technology; The nature of religion; How science has turned humans into giants; From the steam engine to the diesel engine; Humans and their environment.</p>
<p>A particularly important task is to write books for children about the origin of private property and [missing word] how it hinders the evolution of modern humans.</p>
<p>We must find first-class writers and artists to write books and draw pictures about the real conditions of nations around the world. It is best to have geographers and people who have participated in various expeditions scattered throughout the Soviet Union tell us about the situation of the nations within the Soviet Union. They will explain the life forms of these nations and at the same time foster an international outlook in children.</p>
<p>In short, we must rebuild the entire children's literature on a new principle, giving literary, scientific and artistic understanding [missing words] a wide new path.</p>
<p>A struggle is taking place in human society to free the labor of the working masses from the oppression of the private property system and the capitalist system. This is a struggle to transform human physical strength into intelligence. This is a struggle to overcome the forces of nature, to strive for health and longevity, to strive for human unity, and to strive for the free development of human intelligence.</p>
<p>This principle should be the foundation of all children's literature. We must remember that the strange and incredible fairy tales of the old days have now become facts with the power of science. We must give children stories based on the most advanced modern scientific hypotheses; to enable them not only to calculate and criticize, but also to have imagination and [missing word] ability. [Missing word] In children's literature, there should not be a [missing word] boundary between literary books and popular science books. How should this be done? How to make textbooks lively and emotional?</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes of a Sick Prisoner</h3>
<p>— Xiaolong</p>
<p>(6) Companions of Sick Prisoners</p>
<p>The next day, the bleeding stopped. The pain also lessened a bit. I was also able to speak. So I gradually began to get to know my fellow sick prisoners.</p>
<p>There were four people in our room. The first one entering the door was a child of only eight or nine years old. He was sick with bone tuberculosis. Because he was first misdiagnosed by a quack doctor, when he was carried into this hospital, the doctor had to surgically remove a part of his sexual organs. Whether this will affect his future reproductive function, we don't know. As for himself, he probably wouldn't even think about it. Precisely because he doesn't know what worry is, he is the happiest compared to our group of unfortunates. He can eat anything he wants. He can talk casually without feeling tired. Except when changing medicine, he doesn't feel any pain. Even when he feels pain when changing medicine, he can cry loudly, which is already happier than us, because we can't fully vent our grievances and bitterness, can we still cry loudly? What we also envy is that not only at night, but even during the day, he can sleep soundly and comfortably. Compared to the few of us who have to wait until late at night to fall asleep, we really feel that the heart of a child who has never been disturbed by worries is the most nostalgic.</p>
<p>The second one was a clerk working in a bank. He came here for surgery for his stomach illness. When I came in, it was already the third day after his surgery. Because he needed a stronger anesthesia, it is said that after more than an hour of surgery, he has not felt the slightest pain, although one of his hands has not yet regained sensation. As I see it, his lack of pain already makes me feel that he is happier than me. Probably because of a little more bleeding, he is very weak. He once said to me with a sigh, but also humorously, that stomach disease is the most pitiful. He said that if his stomach disease cannot be cured, and at the same time he suffers from the same disease as the child in the same room, then the two greatest pleasures in life will be gone. In such a situation, even if you wear the most beautiful clothes and live in the most magnificent house, what interest is there? It is better to just lie in the grave. We all laughed when we heard this. A word spoken from a real experience of pain is often more true than the theory published by a philosopher after ten years of research.</p>
<p>The third bed was where I was lying. The fourth was a student, a typhoid patient who was about to recover. He was the most comforted person in our group mentally. Because he is a devout Christian, he often sings hymns softly and recites prayers softly. When I heard him say that this illness would probably delay his graduation exam, and therefore expressed my regret to him, he replied very calmly, saying that this was the will of God, which cannot be complained about. Therefore, when he asked me if I was a Christian, I immediately replied with a "yes", knowing that this would definitely give him great happiness.</p>
<p>Here, I realized the reason why religion can exist.</p>
<p>In this way, the four of us unfortunates, as if we were guilty prisoners, were locked in this small room all day, losing all freedom. We can't talk much, but we respond to each other with our eyes. Although we have known each other for such a short time, our friendship is sincere.</p>

<h3>How is the Rural Economy This Year —Observations from the Past Few Months—</h3>
<p>— Luo Mingjun</p>
<p>Last year, the call for rural revitalization resounded throughout the sky, and attention was paid to improving the production technology of rice, silk, cotton, wheat, and tea. How is the rural economy this year? Looking at the situation in the past four months, it is enough to see the prospects for this year. Since the beginning of spring this year, a general decline in agricultural products has been seen everywhere. The situation when new grains enter the market in spring and autumn is different. According to previous examples, grain prices must be higher in spring than in autumn, but this spring in rice-producing areas in various provinces, grain prices still follow the low prices of last autumn when there was so-called "disaster in harvest", and even fell further than before. In provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, the decline in rice prices since the beginning of spring is rare in the past five or six years. White *Jing* rice in areas such as Wuxi, Kunshan, and Changshu only sells for six or seven *yang* per *shi*. The main reason for the low rice prices in the producing areas is that the urban rice markets have been seized by foreign rice. Domestic rice in the producing areas cannot be transported to places where rice is needed due to inconvenient transportation, the hindrance of heavy taxes, and the multiple layers of exploitation by intermediate merchants. This situation has become a regular phenomenon. In other words, farmers who mainly grow rice will definitely not hope to improve their lives this year due to the occasional favorable weather and rainfall or other favorable conditions.</p>
<p>Not only is rice, which is China's main agricultural product, like this, but also various other agricultural products are declining. As the *Nanhua Daily* reported on March 19, "Guangdong Province is suffering from the declining prices of local grains, and local grain products in the four villages are also being hit by foreign miscellaneous grains, resulting in the same unsalable situation. For example, local raw oil was sold for thirty-eight yuan per *dan* two years ago, but now it has fallen to twenty-two or twenty-three yuan." The *Xinwen Bao* reported on March 10, "Ya'an, Sichuan border area, is famous for producing tea, but in recent years, sales have decreased day by day, and tea prices have fallen day by day. In the first year of the Republic of China, each *piao* of about 85 *jin* was worth five yuan, in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, it was worth five yuan, and recently each *piao* is only worth four yuan and three *jiao*." The *Dagong Bao* reported on March 18, "Shandong silk products used to be exported from coastal areas such as Yantai and Longkou, reaching about 30 million yuan per year. Including transportation and sales to other places, exports totaled more than 50 million yuan per year, but now it has completely stagnated. Shandong's peanut oil exports at least 30 million yuan per year, but now there is a lot of inventory and no sales at all."</p>
<p>The decline in sales of agricultural products will inevitably affect the decline in production. Under today's various social conditions, it is further promoting the decline in agricultural product production. According to a dispatch from Jiashan, Jiangsu, published in the *Shen Bao* on February 20: "Since the appointment of Yang Chun as the head of the county, he has paid special attention to land taxes, and in view of the fact that taxes come from rent, he wants to actively rectify land taxes, and he must first rectify land rent. He specially ordered the tenants who were detained for owing this year's rent rice to be released with a reliable guarantor, but they must pay the full amount within half a month, otherwise they will be dealt with according to law." According to another newspaper report, there are still hundreds of tenant farmers detained in the tenant detention center in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, who owe rent from last year. The county government recently realized that the spring plowing and sowing season is approaching, and had to specially allow the tenants to be released on bail, but they must first pay for the food expenses during the detention period, and as a result, the detained tenants still cannot get out of the detention center. Under this circumstance, even if the tenants can get out of the detention center and resume farming, due to the lack of farming capital and the fall in grain prices, they will only be slaughtered by commercial capitalists, usurers, and landlords, making this tragic fate repeat itself once again.</p>
<p>Recently, the phenomenon of spring famine has become apparent in the Jiangbei area of Jiangsu, and in the silk-producing area of Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, when silkworms should be raised, the price of silkworm eggs has fallen and sales have decreased by one-third compared to last year. Originally, farmers have experienced in the past few years that hard work for a year often still results in losses, so many have given up farming and do not seek silkworms. As an investigation by a private education hall in Changshu County, Jiangsu, showed, "In the 1,130 *mu* of rice fields surveyed in Gu Fangqiao village, the rice produced last winter was only 1,348 *shi*, with an average yield of only 1.2 *dou* per *mu*. In addition, the price of agricultural products has plummeted, and the income per *mu* is only 4.8 *yuan*. However, the cost of cultivation per *mu* requires 0.3 *yuan* for seeds and 1.5 *yuan* for fertilizer, totaling 1.8 *yuan*; the remaining 3 *yuan* includes rent, wages, etc. Therefore, most of the income of tenant farmers is in deficit. According to the above investigation, tenant farmers who cultivate less than 5 *mu* have an average annual income of 70 *yuan* per family, an average expenditure of 100 *yuan*, and a loss of 30 *yuan*; those who cultivate less than 10 *mu* have an income of 100 *yuan*, an expenditure of 120 *yuan*, and a loss of 20 *yuan*; those who cultivate less than 20 *mu* have an income of 160 *yuan*, and the income and expenditure are the same." (February 25, *Dawan Bao*)</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the widespread disasters last year, rural finance has become more depleted, resulting in a further reduction in the scope of production. For example, farmers rarely prepare their own silkworm capital for raising silkworms. Most of them borrow from local banks, shops, landlords, and wealthy gentry first, and then repay them with silk cocoons. However, in the past few years, the price of silk has fallen, and silk merchants have suffered heavy losses, and farmers have been unable to repay the loans in time. Based on this situation, the production of silk this year will inevitably be reduced compared to before. Moreover, the depletion of rural finance is one of the basic reasons for rural economic bankruptcy, and cannot be achieved by partial relief. For example, a certain province, in order to relieve rural finance, established a farmers' bank to lend money to farmers. The bank's fund is to extract 2 *jiao* per *mu* from all farmers. The target of the loans is credit cooperatives, and the members of the credit cooperatives are farmers with mortgages. In this way, only farmers with stronger economic capabilities can benefit from it, while poor farmers first bear the burden of allocating funds. The Hua Yang Relief Association's credit loans in disaster areas such as Hunan and Hubei resulted in a small number of loans being absorbed by landlords and usurers by various means. Poor farmers were unable to repay them when they were due, and they could only lose their "borrowing rights." The agricultural loans of urban banking capitalists are fundamentally just a type of banking business, and the benefits do not extend to the poor who have no "credit."</p>
<p>Last year, natural disasters swept through various provinces. Although it is still early this year and the disaster season has not yet reached its peak, the signs of continued occurrence have already been seen. For example, the *Shun Pao* reported on February 6: "Last year, the Yellow River breached in three places, forming an unprecedented disaster. Although the breaches in Lanfeng and Shuipangzhuang have been closed, the breach in Shitou Zhuang on the north bank has not yet been resolved. Moreover, the rising water has formed ice piles like mountains, making the project even more difficult to repair, and the disaster is still severe. The embankments along the river have been washed away and collapsed more severely than before. If we do not urgently seek good deeds and earnestly cultivate and repair them, then when the flood season arrives, let alone encountering floods again, the breaches will flood, and the flood will go north to submerge Wei, which can affect Tianjin and Gu, and go south to seize the Huai, which can harm Su and An. The disaster of land subsidence is unimaginable. Even if we are fortunate enough to encounter normal water levels, the residents along the river will inevitably suffer the disaster of fish." For example, the *Zhonghua Daily* reported on March 14: "The Yongding River project in Ji Province is 60,000 yuan short of funds. The river is currently very strong, and there are many collapses and damages along the embankments. If we do not rush to carry out spring work, the danger is worrying."</p>
<h3>Status of China's Agricultural Trade and Marketing Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Hefa</p>
<p>Since the invasion of capitalism, Chinese farmers' agricultural products and daily necessities have been swept into the whirlpool of commodities, and the characteristics of the local economy of self-cultivation and self-sufficiency in food and clothing have been completely destroyed. Not only must farmers sell their own agricultural products in order to exchange them for cash, but also the simple and inferior daily necessities used by farmers must also rely on the market. In this situation, the trade problem in rural areas has become an important aspect of the rural economy that directly affects the lives of farmers.</p>
<p>With the expansion of the agricultural crisis, the degree of commodification of Chinese farmers' agricultural products has become increasingly deepened. Heavy taxes and high rents force farmers to sell their grain from the previous year. In times of severe disasters, farmers even have to sell their farming tools and land, not to mention agricultural products. Therefore, the more economically backward or the more agricultural crises there are in the region, the weaker the economic capacity of the poor farmers, and the greater the impact of agricultural trade relations on their lives. According to rural surveys in various places, Chinese farmers' sales of agricultural products are often linked to loans, in other words, commercial capital and usury capital in Chinese rural areas are combined and cannot be separated. Commercial capital appears in the form of usury capital in rural trade relations, which is the "pre-sale" or "mortgage" of farmers' agricultural products.</p>
<p>Although Chinese farmers do not necessarily sell all their agricultural products through pre-sale and mortgage methods, it can be said that at least a large number of them adopt this method. According to a survey by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau on the cotton trade in the producing areas of the country, the report said: "In remote villages, cotton farmers sell cotton in the so-called primitive market. Most of the Chinese small farmers are used to pledging the cotton they produce as collateral when planting cotton, and borrow money from rice merchants, grocery merchants, or cotton dealers. During the cotton picking period in August, September, October, and November, lenders buy the cotton from cotton farmers according to the agreed price, rarely according to the actual market price." The bureau's survey of the tung seed trade in Yuqian County, Zhejiang, is also the same situation. The report said: "Before the new tung seeds are released, customers first lend money to tung farmers, and the two parties stipulate the quality of the oil seeds, the delivery deadline, and its value. The level of pricing depends on the amount of the loan and the delivery deadline. When the tung seeds have not been released, the price is first estimated, which inevitably contains the meaning of heavy interest, and the tung farmers are exploited." Other agricultural products are also mainly sold through pre-sale and mortgage, such as the so-called "releasing summer rice" in Changxing, Zhejiang, the so-called "releasing green rice" in Lin'an County, the so-called "mortgaging bamboo" in Wukang County, and even the selling of white-headed mulberry in Pinghu County, the releasing of green leaf money in Jiaxing County, the monstrous wind rice in Qianshan County, Anhui, and the branch sales in Mian County, Shaanxi, are all of the same nature of agricultural mortgage and pre-sale.</p>
<p>By selling agricultural products by means of pre-sale or mortgage, farmers not only bear heavy and harsh high interest, but also the valuation of the price is entirely controlled by merchants, and farmers often cannot get even "half" of the original value. However, the burdens of the various burdens drive farmers to endure this dual exploitation of commercial capital and usury capital.</p>
<p>In addition to pre-sale, in economically backward areas, farmers sell most of their agricultural products by going to market fairs and temple fairs. In many places, there is no regular market every day, and farmers can only sell their agricultural products during market fairs or temple fairs. Taking Dading County, Guizhou Province, as an example, according to the survey: "Cities and villages all hold markets on a regular basis, cities once every four days, and villages once every six days. Farmers go to nearby markets to sell goods for money, and then use the money to buy what they need."</p>
<p>The characteristics of market and temple fair trade are the excessively short trading time and the distance between the dates. Because of these characteristics, farmers suffer significant damage in trade. Because agricultural products are not easy to store for a long time, and farmers generally need cash urgently due to poverty, farmers have to sell their agricultural products at every market, regardless of price increases or decreases. In this situation, the position of farmers is only slightly better than pre-sale and mortgage.</p>
<p>Because what is practiced in China is the widespread small peasant tenancy, the amount of agricultural products produced by farmers is not large, so even if farmers sell their agricultural products without pre-sale or mortgage, or without selling them in market fairs or temple fairs, they all go through multiple layers of exploitation by intermediaries. For example, rice dealers, grain stores, etc. in rural areas are the most powerful intermediaries in the initial trade of agricultural products. Furthermore, the *yaxing* (brokerage firms) that are set up everywhere are the key to agricultural trade in rural areas, and most of the agricultural products must first pass through the hands of the *yaxing* before they can be transported and sold. According to a survey by the Beiping Social Survey Institute: "The main income of the *yaxing* is the brokerage commission, and the brokerage commission can only be received after the transaction is completed, so greedy *yaxing* must do their best to increase the amount of the transaction. If there are transactions that are not easy to complete, they must try to cover up for both parties in order to achieve them. The *yaxing* should be a middleman trusted by both parties, but in this case, they even sacrifice the interests of both parties. Sometimes, because one party in the transaction is ignorant and easily deceived, the *yaxing* often does not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of the other party for the benefit of one party." It is without doubt that the ones being sacrificed are the "ignorant" farmers.</p>
<p>Commercial capitalists in rural areas can use various illegal cheating methods by taking advantage of the weakness of farmers' economic capacity and their lack of knowledge to exploit farmers in agricultural trade. The main ones are the difference in weights and measures and the rise and fall of prices, which are the best opportunities for merchants to exploit farmers.</p>
<p>The lack of uniformity and the great differences in weights and measures are common phenomena throughout China. Although there are legal standard weights and measures in rural areas, merchants can also discard them without using them, and farmers have no choice but to suffer, even if they know they are at a disadvantage. In the tea-producing area of Qimen, Anhui, tea merchants use different weights and measures to exploit tea farmers, which can be taken as an example. According to the report: "The only means for local tea merchants to exploit mountain households is to buy raw tea and use large scales. The usual twelve *liang* is equivalent to sixteen *liang*, encroaching 38%; the new system of scales that is equivalent to thirteen *liang* and six *qian* encroaches 62%. The encroachment is so obvious, and when the tea market is strong, they use twenty-one *liang*, or twenty-three *liang*, or even twenty-four *liang*." In western Zhejiang, according to a survey by the Social Survey Institute: "Irregular brokers often prepare two sizes of *hu* (bushels). When farmers come to sell, they use the large *hu* to measure in, and when farmers come to buy rice, they use the small *hu* to sell out. The large *hu* has a difference of two *sheng* (tenths of a *dou*) or one *sheng* per *shi* (unit of dry measure) compared to the standard *hu*, and the small *hu* sometimes differs from the standard *hu* by up to one *dou* per *shi*. There are similar malpractices in using scales."</p>
<p>In rural areas, the rise and fall of prices are inherently without standards. Not only is there a big change in the price of agricultural products before and after the harvest, but also at ordinary times, the rise and fall of all prices are manipulated by merchants and gentry. For example, the grain prices in the northwestern counties of Hubei Province "are always manipulated by landlords and rich people." Hoarding grain and monopolizing market prices are common business methods of Chinese merchants, and this situation is inevitably more severe in backward rural areas. Secondly, such as the chaos of the currency system, the heavy taxes, and the difficulty of transportation, all make it impossible for farmers in the Chinese interior to transport farmers' goods to the market and sell them directly to consumers, and they have to endure the exploitation of middlemen.</p>
<p>Under this situation, farmers are, of course, unable to recover costs due to being exploited at every level, and at the same time, it is because of this level of exploitation that the cost of Chinese agricultural products increases, and the price has to increase accordingly, making it impossible to transport them to cities for sale, and further forming one of the reasons for "bumper harvests becoming disasters." Therefore, whether it is to improve the situation of farmers or to revitalize agriculture and increase production, the urgent task today is to change this trade relationship of agricultural products.</p>
<p>The best way to change the trade relationship of agricultural products in today's rural areas is naturally state control. However, state control of agricultural production and agricultural trade has difficulties that are greater than controlling foreign trade due to the large scope and the differences in local conditions, and cannot be realized at present. The next best thing, which is in line with the current situation and is easy to achieve results, is to organize agricultural marketing cooperatives.</p>
<p>The main function of the agricultural marketing cooperative is to collect the scattered agricultural products of farmers and apply commercial technology to transport and sell them directly to the consumer market in an orderly manner. On the one hand, this can avoid the exploitation of many middlemen, and on the other hand, it can use more abundant capital and manpower, and it will inevitably be able to obtain more reasonable prices. Moreover, if a policy of economic control is implemented, this marketing cooperative is also the best tool for implementing controlled trade.</p>
<p>Recently, the central government has a special bureau for food transportation and marketing, and the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank has already launched agricultural product transportation and marketing. The lending target of the Shanghai Bank's agricultural lending department is also a cooperative of the same nature. This measure will naturally make a change in the trade relationship in rural areas. However, we always believe that cooperative undertakings, even if they are not socialism with its entire social transformation system, are at least a social policy, and definitely not a business tool or commercial means. Therefore, the fundamental spirit of the agricultural marketing cooperative, in addition to changing the original trade relationship in rural areas, also has its ultimate purpose, and is not a new commercial tool to replace the old trade methods. Its fundamental spirit, on the one hand, should make the cooperative become the farmers' own thing, so that the farmers' agricultural products can be sold directly to consumers through the marketing cooperative, so as to eliminate the exploitation of middlemen and improve the farmers' own living conditions. On the other hand, it must also take the entire national economy as the basis, and the marketing cooperative must take on the mission of promoting agriculture and regulating the market. If the marketing cooperative still appears as an intermediary that has nothing to do with the producing farmers and urban consumers, then the cooperative undertaking is just a commercial act. The actual situation of implementation will have to be further studied.</p>
<h3>The Collapse of the Rural Pawnbroking Industry and Countermeasures (Continued from the April 30th Manuscript)</h3>
<p>— Wang Zongpei</p>
<p>In summary, since opening a pawnshop no longer offers the same operational certainty as before, the old hands at "using capital to seek profit" cannot help but feel disheartened. The gradual closure of pawnshops has become a natural result. However, we must note that pawnshops are ultimately an important financial institution in rural areas. Their decline undoubtedly has a significant impact on the circulation of rural finance. Originally, the decline of pawnshop businesses would have been a good opportunity for charitable pawnshops to rise. But in the current state of extreme social and economic distress, hoping to widely establish charitable pawnshops is no different from "a fool's daydream." As a second-best option, we can only try to promote pawnshop-style collateral lending institutions to alleviate this immediate crisis.</p>
<p>The so-called "pawnshop-style collateral lending institution" already exists in Zhejiang, namely the "Longyou County Local Bank." Its nature is different from that of ordinary banks. Lacking a better name, it is called "Pawnshop Bank." Farmers can bring their short jackets and long robes to pledge for a few jiao to several yuan. In summer, they pawn cotton quilts; in winter, they pawn mosquito nets. They shuttle back and forth throughout the year, a constant stream. The interest rate is only 1.5%, plus a storage fee of 0.6%, which is already much lower than the 2% to 2.5% charged by ordinary pawnshops.</p>
<p>The Longyou County Local Bank has a considerable history and is run by Jiang Qizhou. The authorized capital stock is 110,950 yuan. By the end of the 20th year, the paid-up capital was less than half, only 51,350 yuan. By the end of the 21st year, however, it had increased to 76,780 yuan, an increase of 15,430 yuan compared to the previous year. In terms of deposits, the total at the end of the 20th year was 114,783.304 yuan. The total at the end of the 21st year was slightly lower, at 113,527.532 yuan. As for lending operations, the progress was more significant. The total amount of loans at the end of the 20th year was 136,457.926 yuan, which increased to 144,865.072 yuan at the end of the 21st year. Because there are no pawnshops in Longyou, the bank also provides loans secured by clothing and gold and silver. At the end of the 21st year, these loans totaled 45,512.200 yuan, accounting for 31.4% of the total. The bank's business report for the 21st year is extracted below:</p>

<p>From the business report of Longyou County Local Bank, it can be observed that county local banks have the potential to develop a business that combines mortgages on clothing and gold and silver ornaments. For example, at the end of June of the 21st year, loans secured by clothing totaled 44,275.40 yuan, accounting for 30.41% of total loans. In the winter of the same year, this type of lending decreased to 27,307.60 yuan, only accounting for 18.85% of total loans. This significant decrease is also worthy of study. On the one hand, it demonstrates the unique characteristics of rural finance, where the second half of the year is not as financially strained as the first half. On the other hand, it is because of the good harvest that year that farmers had surplus funds to redeem their pawned items. Another point is the seasonality of pledged items. Generally speaking, winter clothing is more valuable than summer clothing. In the summer, one can pawn winter clothes to raise funds, but in the winter, one has to redeem them to get through the cold season. The same phenomenon occurs with gold and silver mortgages, but it is not as obvious as with clothing.</p>
<p>The Longyou County Local Bank is located in the county town of Longyou, and its business naturally focuses on the county town for the most part. Farmers in the villages further away from the town probably have limited access to its benefits. To remedy this deficiency, it seems possible to imitate the method of "connecting pawnshops" or "acting as a pawnshop" by establishing branch offices in more important towns. If there is no confidence in establishing branch offices, it may be possible to try running "mobile" collateral loan offices, scheduling a rotation schedule, and borrowing village offices as temporary business locations. This method may seem novel and risky, but with long-term implementation, it may also achieve considerable success.</p>
<p>Since its establishment of the Agricultural Cooperative Loan Department, the Shanghai Bank has determined that promoting cooperative enterprises is the fundamental way to rescue China's rural economy. However, they are also well aware of the current lack of education among Chinese farmers and the scarcity of capable leaders in rural areas. Seeking the widespread adoption of cooperatives across the country in the short term is not easy. Therefore, to meet immediate needs, in addition to the organization of cooperatives, they are studying a pawnshop-style farmer collateral loan office, which can not only pawn rice but also clothing and jewelry. At the same time, they feel that pawnshops are indeed an important financial institution in rural areas. However, new organizations, such as the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee and the National Association of Vocational Education, all advocate cooperatives. They are also studying the methods of connecting these two types of organizations, cooperatives, and pawnshops. The results of this research will make a significant contribution to both the pawnbroking industry and cooperative undertakings. From a practical point of view, whether it is promoting pawnshops or establishing farmer collateral loan offices, some daily expenses are inevitable. If expenses are to be kept low, then the business cannot be widespread. If the business is to be widespread, then expenses will certainly be high. Now, if expenses are to be kept low and the business is to be widespread, then it is only possible to select more important towns and start pilot projects first, and then gradually promote them to less important towns. Before pawnshops or farmer collateral loan offices are established in less important towns, for the sake of farmers' welfare, there should also be an organization of mobile pawnshops or farmer collateral loan offices. These mobile pawnshops or farmer collateral loan offices would take the established farmer collateral loan office as the parent office and rotate their business in neighboring villages in stages. In this way, although the expenses would be slightly higher, it would be much more economical than establishing many branch offices. At the same time, farmers would also receive full benefits in terms of borrowing.</p>
<p>In summary, promoting pawnshops and establishing farmer collateral loan offices are both urgent tasks at present. However, considering the current needs, starting mobile pawnshops or farmer collateral loan offices may be easier to implement. With lower costs, a wider geographical area, and the opportunity for farmers in various villages to borrow, will the results achieved not be even greater? (End)</p>

<h3>Securities: Last Week's Bond Market Was Ordinary and Lacked Distinctive Features</h3>
<p>The market prices on the Hua Shang Securities Exchange during the past week, May 7th to 12th, were extremely dull and unremarkable. As the political situation is chaotic and still brewing, the general sentiment is that diplomatic incidents are frequent and the risk of escalation is particularly high. Therefore, those who would buy are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and those who would sell are naturally unwilling to cover their positions quickly. Large sellers, such as Nos. 5, 13, 42, and 39, have released extremely large quantities. Among them, No. 5's sales are all backed by actual goods and are unlikely to be covered quickly. The rest have released forward contracts and are not subject to immediate pressure. Large buyers, such as Nos. 16, 48, 53, and 75, have also taken in quite large amounts. About half of them may not take delivery. As for retail investors, buyers are more numerous. In general, the Ningbo and Guangdong communities are sellers, and the Ningzhen community is buyers. The future trend is worthy of study. The past week has been characterized by a stable environment, confused sentiment, chaotic market conditions, and a wait-and-see attitude on both sides. Most of the trading has been sideways. On Monday, because Nos. 21 and 50 covered their short positions and No. 48 bought, the market price rose by 0.2-0.3 yuan to 0.6-0.7 yuan. On Tuesday, trading decreased significantly, and all communities adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Only retail investors made slight moves, and the market also traded sideways and entered a state of stagnation. Prices fluctuated and the difference between highs and lows was only 0.1-0.2 yuan. Wednesday was National Humiliation Memorial Day, and the market was closed for one day. On Thursday, trading remained sluggish and the market traded sideways with a downward bias. Each session saw highs and lows, but the final result was a slight decrease of 0.3-0.4 yuan. On Friday, the political situation was chaotic and there were rumors in the market. Buyers emerged slightly, and the trend was slowly downward throughout the day, which was quite discouraging. The market fell by another 0.3-0.8 yuan. On Saturday, the market rebounded, No. 16 bought in extremely large quantities, and the market was uniformly upward, which was the inverse of Friday. The market price rose uniformly by 0.3-0.8 yuan. As a result of the week, except for the 18th Customs Consolidation, which fell slightly by 0.3-0.4 yuan, the rest all saw a slight increase of 0.1 yuan to about 0.5 yuan. The total turnover, including spot and futures, was 44,855,000 yuan. The results of the price changes are listed in the comparative table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Overseas Cotton Market Listless</h3>
<p>Yesterday's US cotton market lacked major buyers. The cotton cloth market was weak and fell, and then recovered as sellers covered their positions. As a result, spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices rose and fell by 1-3 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices fell by 7 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to buyer liquidations, then recovered as European exporters bought, and finally fell again as buyers took profits. As a result, Bengal fell by 1 rupee, Omra fell by 2 rupees, and Broach fell by 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is listed below (dated the 12th):</p>

<h3>Qingdao: Survey of Cotton Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Weaving factories in the vicinity of Qingdao are reducing wages, so it is profitable to increase purchases of surplus Shanghai cotton yarn and promote sales in the north, which is still brisk, causing purchases from Tianjin and Qingdao local gangs, totaling about 10,000 bales, mainly 32s, followed by 42s. However, due to high raw cotton prices and commercial depression, the market is relatively weak. Undyed cloth seems to be selling well in this period of demand, but the environment is very bad, and buyers dare not touch it due to high prices, and there are no large transactions. Due to exchange rate relations, colored cloth, especially Japanese products, is relatively expensive and trading is quiet. Only spring products such as bleached muslin, printed plain cloth, and twill cloth with stripes are selling better. Most of the other cotton cloth is from Shanghai, and most of the rayon is smuggled in from Dalian, it is said.</p>
<h3>Grains: Shanghai Southern Rice Market Rises</h3>
<p>The source of supply from various gangs is still scarce. It is estimated that 13th and 14th grade late rice, thick粳, and various grades of 15th and 16th grade, totaling more than 4,000 dan, have arrived. Initially, both retail and wholesale merchants were half-hearted, and the market did not show any distinctive features. Gradually, the source of supply dried up, and each began to compete, and the market began to rise. At this time, the North Ocean Gang merchants had exhausted all of the Qingjiao, Song, and Si goods, and the South Ocean Gang only obtained 300 packages of Liantang, Cuanlai Temple goods, and the market rose by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The various thick粳 followed suit, and the market was also brisk, rising by 0.2-0.2 yuan. The price of Duyang sharp rice rose by half, and Yinyuan also showed a good color. Bianyuan was the only one to show a good color, rising by 0.5-0.6 yuan due to the cessation of 斛 in the new life movement in the city.</p>

<h3>Northern Goods: Sun-Dried Arillus Longan Listless and Weak</h3>
<p>Xiamen's sun-dried arillus longan has been greatly affected recently by the loosening market price of Hainan goods. The previous offer was once 72-73 yuan, but now the number of holders are willing to lower prices, but few hands are receiving them. The inventory in the market is already thin. If sales are sluggish in the future, coupled with the decline in Hainan goods, the situation is very unlikely to be good. There are sporadic new goods on the market, and retail sales have already fallen by 3-4 yuan, and old goods are even weaker.</p>
<h3>Haikou: News of Abundant Lychee Harvest</h3>
<p>Haikou lychee dried fruit had a low production last year, and the market price was relatively stable. The current inventory in Shanghai is indeed limited. Recently, the price of top-grade Jinshan branches has fallen sharply, and this kind of ordinary goods is of course difficult to improve and the path out is also lacking. According to letters from the locality, the new seedlings this year are quite good. If the process is good, the harvest this year will be abundant, and the approximate production should be around 200,000 dan, and new fruit can be logged next month, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Variable Quality of Spring Silkworms in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>(Haining) In Chang'an, Xucun, Shijia Yan, Yuanjia and other places, this year is generally designated as an improved silkworm area. Guidance officers distributed improved seeds. Due to the cold weather, the incubation period was delayed for 14-15 days before harvesting. Through universal disinfection and full guidance by the guidance officers, artificial efforts were made to rescue the silkworms from the changes in weather during the second and third sleeps, and there was little loss of silkworm ants. However, due to economic reasons, the local silkworms raised by farmers are not as healthy as the improved seeds and are unable to resist the harsh climate, so the damage is more serious. Now the early silkworms have entered the big sleep and opened their leaves, and the late silkworms have also had three sleeps and have sufficient leaves. The improved silkworm ants are eating leaves more vigorously, and the current situation is turning for the better.</p>
<p>(Lin'an) This has been a model silkworm area. The improved seeds raised by farmers this year are still relatively strong. It is a pity that the climate is too cold, and the emergence of silkworms is delayed. After waking from sleep, the emphasis is on using fire to supplement the temperature, and the young silkworms are raised together, and all are fed with new mulberry leaves. Later, as the weather turned bad, the guidance officers provided day and night care to remedy the work of nature with reasonable new methods, so the silkworm ants only showed delayed leaf retention and insomnia, and the losses were still minor. Now the situation has turned from dangerous to safe, and the early gangs have entered the big sleep and have abundant leaves. However, the local silkworms raised by farmers suffered from silkworm diseases during the third and fourth sleeps and suffered heavy damage.</p>
<p>(Xinchang) In the Huangze area, this year's silkworm raising is more popular. However, the spring is cold and the hatching is delayed. Also, due to the economic downturn, raising local varieties is not weak. The abnormal and harsh weather has greatly affected the development of the silkworm ants. Fortunately, the guidance officers disinfected and assisted fully in turns, and the improved seeds only developed more slowly. The local silkworms had weak resistance and were often abandoned. Now the large gangs have entered the big sleep, and there are still leaves. The improved silkworms are in a better state, and in another ten days, the new cocoons can be laid.</p>
<p>(Yuanhua) Farmers in Yuanhua Jinshidun and other areas of Haining County raised silkworms in the spring, and the silkworms were unevenly harvested. The young silkworms passed well after waking from sleep. After the second sleep, due to the cold and rainy weather, many local silkworms showed symptoms of spitting, diarrhea, and softening. The development of improved silkworms was delayed. The early gang is now in big sleep, and the late gang is only three sleeps with abundant leaves. In recent days, the climate has changed drastically, and the local silkworms have suffered from silkworm disease, which has spread rapidly, almost leading to the abandonment of all the leaves. The improved silkworms also have symptoms of stiffness, lying prostrate, and roaming, and silkworm farmers are pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Rayon Imported</h3>
<p>The Italian mail ship Conte Verde, which entered the port the day before yesterday, brought 1,400 boxes of rayon from various countries such as Italy, England, America, France and Germany, which were loaded from Curitiba and other ports, and stored in the Shanghai Customs warehouse for pick-up.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Worsted Serge Sales Brisk, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Grey worsted serge sales are particularly strong now. Tailor shops on this street are stocking up heavily. Several batches have also been shipped to Tianjin. The initial asking price was four dollars and seventy-eight cents per yard, but due to a surge in arrivals, prices have fallen. Yesterday, the "祥" brand traded at four dollars and forty cents, while the "和記," "華記," and "怡和" brands traded at three dollars and ninety cents. Transactions occurred between firms and tailors, and the market appears quite active.</p>
<p>Secondly, white drill has seen broad sales recently. Various firms have requested samples, and the market is very lively. Especially scarce are those priced around four dollars per yard. Unfortunately, both arrivals and inventory are low, and supply cannot meet demand. As a result, inferior white drill is selling very actively. Over ten bolts were sold in the market previously, with a trading price of three dollars and thirty-five cents.</p>
<h3>Metals: New Galvanized Iron Wire Sales in Fujian Thrive</h3>
<p>New galvanized iron wire, sizes eight to twenty-five, has seen lively business from Fujian merchants recently. Transactions totaling over two thousand bundles have occurred in the past three or four days. However, due to looser exchange rates, prices have softened compared to before. Currently, the market estimates eight dollars per bundle for number eight wire, eight dollars and ten cents for number nine, eight dollars and twenty cents for number ten, eight dollars and sixty cents for number eleven, eight dollars and seventy cents for number twelve, eight dollars and eighty cents for number thirteen, nine dollars for number fourteen, nine dollars and ten cents for number fifteen, nine dollars and fifty cents for number sixteen, nine dollars and sixty cents for number seventeen, nine dollars and eighty cents for number eighteen, ten dollars for number nineteen, ten dollars and six cents for number twenty, ten dollars and nine cents for number twenty-one, eleven dollars and five cents for number twenty-two, eleven dollars and eighty cents for number twenty-three, twelve dollars and twenty cents for number twenty-four, and twelve dollars and fifty cents for number twenty-five. This is a drop of as much as thirty to forty cents compared to prices last week.</p>
<h3>Patterned and Pig Lead Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>The quoted prices for American patterned and pig lead have been high recently. In addition, the Shanghai exchange rate is tight, causing prices to increase repeatedly. The quoted price is sixteen dollars and eighty cents per picul. Local manufacturers on this street still buy it in limited quantities due to practical needs. However, sales to out-of-town merchants are low due to difficulty in resale. Consequently, out-of-town business has been nonexistent for days. As for tea merchants, their purchases are also minimal due to the lackluster new tea market this year. However, prices remain firm. The price of Hunan lead is still around sixteen dollars and thirty to forty cents per picul. Besides local manufacturers on this street, export business is also scarce.</p>

<h3>The Chinese National Character</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Every nationality has its unique characteristics, and the Chinese nation is no exception. What are the characteristics of the Chinese people? I will now present my observations below for everyone to see if they agree:</p>
<p>1.  Caring about "Face": The Chinese care most about "face." As long as face is preserved, they don't care about disgrace. If someone is beaten for no reason, they won't think of resisting. Instead, they will lecture others afterward, thinking they can regain some face. As for being seriously injured, they see it as bad luck.</p>
<p>2.  Accepting Fate: Because the Chinese believe in fate, they are also content with it. When something unpleasant happens, they blame it on fate and feel at peace. Being happy with one's destiny is a key teaching of our ancient sages, so how can we not follow it?</p>
<p>3.  Superstition: All nationalities have superstitious beliefs, but the Chinese seem to be more deeply rooted. We not only believe in gods and ghosts but also in things like astrological signs and are full of taboos. Recently, with the spread of new foreign ideas, superstitious beliefs have begun to waver. However, the Chinese belief is bound by long-standing traditions and deeply rooted, so even though people are calling for the overthrow of superstition, its power still exists.</p>
<p>4.  Emphasis on Empty Rituals: Emphasizing empty rituals is also a characteristic of the Chinese. The elaborate ceremonies used for weddings, funerals, and celebrations are truly a great nuisance. Naturally, China is a nation of propriety, so every action should not deviate from the path of propriety. However, the propriety we uphold is not the essence of propriety but its surface. Therefore, the abuses lead to people deceiving each other with hypocrisy.</p>
<p>5.  Focus on Personal Connections: The Chinese also like to emphasize personal connections. No matter the matter, they rely on personal connections as a guiding principle. This is a remnant of feudal thought. Fathers covering up for their sons and sons covering up for their fathers are extremely common. Interactions between relatives and friends also emphasize personal connections. Even in handling public affairs, the Chinese often prioritize personal connections over public interest.</p>
<p>6.  Sticking to Old Habits: Social customs are the hardest to change, especially for the Chinese, [incomplete sentence due to illegible characters]. Today's Chinese society still retains old customs from thousands of years ago. Logically, society progresses day by day, and people's lives change accordingly. Old customs are not suitable for new lives, but the conservative Chinese do not feel any disharmony.</p>
<p>7.  Ability to Endure Hardship: The lives of the Chinese can be described as very poor. Although we have vast land and abundant resources, we have failed to use these natural gifts to improve our lives. Therefore, despite working hard all year, there is still the worry of not having enough to eat and wear. Because of this, the Chinese are driven by life and have unconsciously developed a character of enduring hardship. Fortunately, the Chinese are usually very self-disciplined and content, so even though they lead lives of excessive hardship, they do not feel it is unbearable.</p>
<p>The above are my observations on the Chinese national character. Some may say that the points I have raised are biased towards the negative aspects and neglect the beautiful aspects. Do the Chinese not have any merits? I think there must be some, but I have only seen these things. Adding legs to a snake only makes it more unrealistic.</p>
<h3>Scientific Spirit Drawing</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>It is a universally acknowledged fact that science has not been very developed in our country. However, everyone probably knows that we have scientific peanuts, right? This is not so surprising, but scientific spirit writing is truly the greatest joke in the world! If you are willing to spend two coppers, I guarantee that within three minutes, without lifting a finger, you can immediately gain some new scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>It turns out that recently, a kind of "Scientific Spirit Drawing" has been found everywhere in the market. It was compiled and printed by the Hong Kong Scientific Amusement Society. According to the advertisements in the newspaper, the inventor is a doctor who studied in Germany. The drawing is quite simple and made of yellow paper. In the middle is a drawing of a ghost face (perhaps it is a ghost face?). Around it are layers of countless small characters. Attached is a sheet of explanatory drawings and a small magnetic disk with the same ghost face drawn on it. The spirit writing method is as follows: place the disk in the center of the yellow paper, and three people each extend one right hand, pressing one finger on the disk, silently chanting "Please, Spirit Disk, invite so-and-so to come and talk." After about ten minutes, the disk will start to rotate. (This is when the Spirit Disk is said to have descended.) Wait for the disk to stop, and see where it stops. Then, according to the characters at that spot, combine them into a sentence to interpret what the spirit is saying. It is said that this drawing is the result of many years of painstaking research by a certain doctor and is constructed using purely scientific methods, without any superstitious elements. It is incomparable to ordinary spirit writing methods. As for its effectiveness, needless to say, "sincerity brings results." As long as the spirit writers are sincere and devout, it will be effective every time.</p>
<p>Our people are truly clever. Not only can peanuts be manufactured using scientific methods to make food scientific, but spirit writing can also be improved using scientific principles to make superstition scientific. Since the power of science is so omnipotent, if our great scientists, like that doctor, continue to study diligently, I dare to guarantee that in the near future, scientific eating methods, scientific shitting methods, scientific love techniques, scientific suicide techniques, scientific XXX, scientific XXX</p>
<p>will definitely continue to be invented. Isn't this a great contribution to our country? Furthermore, if we invent one or two scientific methods for resisting foreign aggression and scientific methods for strengthening the country, then what is recovering the lost territories of the Northeast? China may immediately become the world's leading country!</p>
<p>Since Pangu created the world, most of the new inventions in our country have been kept secret. This mentality is very wrong. To remedy this, I believe that this "Scientific Spirit Drawing" should be popularized to the world. This will not only bring glory to China but also benefit the academic world. Next time, if any world scientific conference is to be held, I will first suggest to the government that they no longer send people like Ding Wenjiang and Weng Wenhao to attend. The most suitable person would be the doctor who invented the "Scientific Spirit Drawing."</p>
<p>Such a doctor can be said to be all-powerful. No wonder the Kalachakra initiation presided over by the Panchen Lama has the power to eliminate disasters and misfortunes!</p>

<h3>On Decency</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Nowadays, this society is one that only values clothes and not people. Therefore, decency has become a major skill for navigating life. If we pay attention, we can encounter this fact almost anytime, anywhere. The most obvious example can be found on the tram. We often encounter someone poorly dressed entering the first-class car. [Illegible characters] the conductor will immediately look at that man with an indescribable expression and order him to move to the third class in the back. The meaning is clear: he is not qualified. Even if he is lucky enough to avoid being a lowly guest in first class and not be stopped by the ticket collector, the well-dressed ladies and gentlemen sitting together will surely stare at him with arrogant eyes or show a very disgusted look, as if they have been humiliated by being in the same class. Such situations are not only found on trams but also in any other setting. If your clothes are not neat or torn, no matter how noble your character or how profound your knowledge, you will inevitably be given the cold shoulder and looked down upon, not treated as a human being. On the other hand, if you dress in a fashionable and beautiful way, then no matter if you are a ruthless robber or a walking corpse with nothing to offer, people will always show you considerable respect and be happy to associate with you. As fashion dictates, people cannot avoid following suit, so everyone is mindful of decency. Because if you don't, you will be snubbed for the rest of your life. Therefore, even if you are hungry and your family is half-starved, you still need to wear long robes, mandarin jackets, suits, and leather shoes outside, showing a very lavish appearance.</p>
<p>Decency can be said to be equivalent to a person's facade. A magnificent facade is a symbol of worth, and people will increase or decrease their liking for you accordingly. For example, if you want to visit a high official's residence to ask someone for a job, you should first correct your appearance and tidy up your clothes, making sure not to reveal the slightest bit of poverty. At least the other party will look at your face and deal with you perfunctorily. But if you have a poor and miserable look, you will not only receive a contemptuous reward but may even be kicked out by the servants before you even enter the official's hall. I myself have experienced this countless times. I remember one time, I went with a friend to see an official friend inside the yamen. I was just a commoner with no official position, but because I was wearing more decent clothes, I gained an advantage. So I didn't need to be announced and swaggered in. But my other friend was stopped by the guards because he was wearing a mismatched outfit and looked like a rogue. He was not allowed to leave. After much trouble, he was finally let go. That was already embarrassing enough. From this, we can see that decency is extremely effective and is an indispensable tool for navigating this snobbish society. It is especially needed in official circles. Therefore, decency is like clothing and food to anyone and cannot be spared. And if you can deeply understand the mysteries and make good use of it, you can surely reap endless benefits.</p>
<h3>Being an Official Is Impossible</h3>
<p>— She</p>
<p>In this era of agricultural, forestry, and economic collapse, and urban industrial and commercial decline, everyone feels that nothing is possible. Perhaps the only thing that still has some profit to be made is being an official.</p>
<p>The benefits of being an official are indeed great. If you are lucky enough to get into power, it is not difficult to get your hands on several million dollars through open and covert means. At the very least, three to five hundred thousand is also possible. Yesterday, you were still a poor scholar, and tomorrow you become rich overnight. You can have beautiful wives, concubines, Western-style houses, and cars, enough to live in wealth and enjoy life for a lifetime. Therefore, now, people are willing to be humble and servile, and even if they are sweating profusely, they are still unwilling to let go. Isn't it all because being an official has endless benefits?</p>
<p>Being an official is the only way out for intellectuals who are full of hope. "Where does an official come from if there is no one in the family who studies?" This says it all about the purpose of fathers and elder brothers sending their children to study. This traditional feudal idea has been inherited to this day and is still popular. The reason why China has become so bad, although there are other major reasons that have contributed to it, it cannot be said that it is not deeply affected by this legacy, so that everyone only hopes to climb the official path and does not care about everything else.</p>
<p>In order to become an official, the only shortcut is to wear a facade of some kind of ideology and appeal to national affairs. Therefore, politics serves as a shield for becoming an official, and political power becomes an object of contention. The struggle for official positions serves as a fuse, reflecting the evolution of various political situations. Those who are opportunistic and climb to the top one by one, while those who fall into the water cannot help but be envious and hateful. They turn around, bring their own underlings who are banging gongs and carrying tripods, point to some scars, and curse loudly, even sparing no effort to fight until [incomplete sentence due to illegible characters]. When the other party shows signs of retreat, [incomplete sentence due to illegible characters]. All this [incomplete sentence due to illegible characters], everything is revealed. Because of the uneven distribution of spoils, because the previous efforts were in vain, it is said that when a certain high-ranking person in the central government first came to power, he had performed several full-scale martial arts routines. This is naturally a secret of the officialdom, and outsiders rarely know about it.</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, internal wars have continued year after year. Today I attack you, and tomorrow you overthrow me. I don't know how many lives have been sacrificed and how much money has been wasted. What is it all for? Isn't it just for one or two people to fulfill their desire for officialdom? Once they have a small official position, they want an even bigger one. If they occupy a hard-won position, they also want a lucrative one. Whoever occupies it and refuses to let go, they will overthrow. For the past twenty years, China has been living and breathing in this chaotic state of contention and disturbance. The crux of the matter is that there are too many people obsessed with officialdom, and the allure of officialdom is too great.</p>
<p>However, not long ago, a strange [incomplete sentence due to illegible characters] because he was deeply stimulated and suffered from insomnia for several months, became mentally disordered, and committed suicide by jumping into the river. This is truly a rare occurrence. A small county magistrate is indeed the lowest rank of official, too humble to be worth mentioning, but to become an official to the point of being overstimulated and ending up in such a tragic end cannot help but make people sigh that being an official has also come to a dead end. And let us further trace the recent historical facts. For example, the county magistrates of Pei County and other four counties (?) are still imprisoned in Zhenjiang prison. Xinjiang Chairman Jin Shuren is still appealing. Jiangsu Civil Affairs Director Gu Renfa has lost his official position and can easily resume his old profession, but he has already been subjected to the public's condemnation, and the lawsuit has not yet been finalized. Then what is there to cherish about being an official!</p>
<p>However, the above examples are either about bullying the weak and putting on a show or about the result of different factions fighting each other. This is an inevitable phenomenon in the officialdom. Therefore, some people are still desperately trying to get an official position, which cannot cool the enthusiasm of those who are obsessed with officialdom. It is [incomplete sentence due to illegible characters].</p>
