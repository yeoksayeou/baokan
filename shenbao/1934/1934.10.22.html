<p>自外蒙受蘇俄卵翼。宣佈獨立以來。内蒙情勢向稱嚴重。九一八後。東北四省。相繼淪陷。内蒙東部之三盟二十六旗。亦悉爲日軍所。碩果僅存者。惟西部三盟二十三旗而已。其地當察綏寗三省境内。雖尙爲我國所統轄。而日軍虎視耽耽。早視若囊中物矣。田中奏揩中本有組織「蒙古大源共和國」之陰謀。其意實在造成第二傀儡。北向爲抗衡外蒙蘇俄勢力之緩衝。南向爲侵略吾國中原各省之根據。</p>
<p>最近年餘以來。日本軍事人員。前往西蒙各旗聯絡偵察者。絡繹於途。熱察邊境一帶。且遍植電臺。趕築公路。屯兵積械。待時而動。我國邊備廢弛。歷有年所。日軍固可隨時進取。席捲西蒙。其所以徘徊於沽源多倫間而不卽發動者。並非對我有何顧慮。徒以西蒙與外蒙接壤。在彼抗俄準備猶未成燅對俄政策猶未大定之今日。殊不願過於操切耳。故日人在權衡輕重。審度時勢之餘。以爲最適宜之對蒙策略。莫如以威迫利脅之手段。操縱西蒙王公。使其自行内向。不戰而服。如是則旣不致引起國際重大之反感。又無需自負興師動衆之責任。爲計之得。孰過於此。</p>
<p>雖然。日人此種策略。隨時流露。究難排飾。今姑言其顯而易見者。則如一二月前在興安區之王爺廟設立軍官學校。收納蒙古青年。施以軍事教育。擬在一二年内。編練蒙軍數萬。資以糧械。俾成勁旅。然後。假借革命獨立之名使爲内侵先驅。苟有第三者向彼責難抗議。儘可諉爲西蒙内部之爭。與彼無涉。此一端也。日前報載熱河消息。稱僞組織劃内蒙烏珠穆沁與巴林二旗。歸僞興安省管轄。二旗王子在林西地方與日僞軍衝突云云。查巴林一旗。地屬熱河境内之昭盟。在日固早視爲己有。而烏珠穆沁旗則屬认察省境内之錫盟。尙非僞滿所統轄。然竟亦以劃入僞省聞。上述消息。雖未證實其必確。然來日方長。似此局部併吞之行動。終難保其心無。此又一端也。</p>
<p>夫今後内蒙自治之設施。固有蒙政委員會者首當其衝。然軍事國防之大權則仍操諸中央之掌握。時至今日。我國對於内蒙全局。誠尙思抱殘守闕。自應整飭師旅。鞏固邊防。使甫經萌芽之内蒙自治。不致横遭摧殘。深願中樞當局。及蒙政委員會指導長官等注意及之也。</p>

<p>損失不下三萬萬元</p>
<p>房屋工塲大體恢復</p>
<p>日本的大阪、在我們中國人耳朶裏特别熟、例如日本的船公司、不論它是日本郵船、是山下汽船、是大阪商船、是日清公司、普通一般人都呌它作大阪公司、似乎大阪竟可以代表日本、至少是用大阪來象徵日本、不錯、大阪差不多是日本的代表、因爲她工業製造品、特别是輸出商品、對中國·南洋·等地的輸出物品百分之八十以上、是大阪製造出來的、雖然這不是一個對外商港、却有專船定期往來於天津·上海·香港·南洋·各地、以至於歐洲、不過外國船隻的航行、祗能在神户、到大阪是要受限制的、可是大阪與神户間距離原來很近、最近因興築工廠、提倡對外貿易的結果、這兩個地方差不多要聯成一起了、</p>
<p>大阪已完全形成了近代都市、論人口有二百五十多萬、其所占面積恐怕比上海還大些、所以不像上海那樣擁擠、但是空氣却比上海更壞、上海公共租界的中心、大馬路至六馬路、以及虹口一帶地方、除了外灘、輕易不看見樹木、大阪從大阪驛起、南至大和川、北至新演川、除了中之島公園外、也輕易看不見一片綠葉、不過在上海是被粉香肉氣薰得你頭昏眼花、在大阪則煤烟迷天、使你鼻孔墨黑、</p>
<p>交通工具也確實可以副她的工業需要、電車網編制很得宜、南北東西往來不致於多費時間、并且祇要日金六錢（約大洋五分）卽通行全市、加惠於一般小市民·工人·學生·確很不少、此外市營的公共汽車、也和電車差不多一樣發達、其省費又相同、因爲它經營的目的不在賺錢而在謀交通的便利、增進其整個産業的發展、日本這個國家的工業、不是以大工業見長、而是小工塲爭勝、卽大阪這樣的工業中心區、小工塲還是很多、許多大工塲仍然將部分品交給小工塲去做、所以交通工步電車·公共汽車·等車費便宜、就有更大的作用了、</p>
<p>近兩三年來、日本的鄕村是特别的困苦、租税負擔很重、副業收入（如蠶絲收入）减低、加以空前所未有的天災、所以生活困難、多數的農民都面帶饑色、都市—尤其是大阪這種在輸出方面占絶對優勢的都市、受着二重的恩惠、當然是格外的繁榮了、一則是重工業、準重工業、都得到軍事工業的好處、無形有形中都賺了錢、二則是日本政府竭力提倡向外發展、利用外匯跌落的日金、補助對外輸出貿易、輕工業也得到優惠、可是實際上眞賺到錢的還是少數、普通的都市民、也祇能敷衍溫飽、依體力勞作的工人、所得還因爲日金的跌價而相對的减少、所以一般的消費力并不曾增加、市面好景况終於是假的、</p>
<p>風災水災在大阪特别的利害、大正區·港區·等多數工塲、不是浸水、就是爲風吹倒、其損失究竟有多少、現在官方的統計還不算正確、大約的估計、總不下三萬萬元、連上兵庫縣属、及神户的損失、工業方面合有五萬萬日金、大阪的輪船碼頭、現在還是不可收拾、整理還得相當時日、復原就更要費事了、可是有一件値得我們驚異的、也應該注意的、是自上月廿一日發生風水災、到如今不過三星期、普通的地方固然早已恢復秩序、完全看不出天災的痕跡、卽水災最厲害的「比花區」、「港區」、「大正區」等普通的房屋、也已漸次修補完竣、僅留下若干水漬、工廠的修復有的是比較容易、如機械工塲、有的是比較困難、如木材廠和輕工業、但都拼命努力、要趕快復業、大阪市政當局且請有工程師、純粹義務的指導各中小工塲復業、還低利貸給其所必要的流通資本、所以復工當更便利、可是損失的收回却不甚容易、因爲都市片面的發達、像軍需工業的刺激、恐怕是很難持久的、（一九三四年十月十四日於大阪）、</p>

<p>陸空軍化學隊蘇俄均可操左劵</p>
<p>大興安嶺之得失爲勝負之所擊</p>
<p>（哈爾濱通訊）據哈埠熟悉日俄兩國備戰情形之某軍事家談稱、日俄在遠東角逐之形勢、已至圖窮匕見、大戰爆發、隨時有可能性、就雙方備戰之陸海空軍勢力、並戰略上與軍事領袖之統率力、及國家財政生産事業軍需資源等來觀測、勝利恐屬蘇俄云云、茲紀該軍事家所談如下、</p>
<p>日俄軍備　（甲）陸軍方面、一日本陸軍、據今年八月日本陸軍省所提出十年度之預算總額、爲六億八千萬元、平時兵力約二十三萬、戰時兵力、每師人數爲二萬五千人、全國動員人數、可增五百萬、（二）蘇聯陸軍、最近預算不詳、　據一九三零年國際裁軍準備委員會調查、爲七億七千八百萬元、常備軍正規軍五十六萬二千人國家保安隊十三萬名、共計六十九萬二千名、據一九三三年調查、蘇聯常備軍、已增至一百三十萬名戰時可增至七百五十萬、（乙）海軍方面、（一）日本、據日本海軍省十年度預算總額爲七億一午四百七十萬元、海軍艦數、計有主力艦九隻、噸數二七二·八七零、航空母艦四隻、噸數六八·八七零、甲級巡洋艦十四隻、噸數一二三·五二零、乙級巡洋艦二十隻、噸數九三·三七五、驅逐艦一百零二隻、噸數一二一·零五六、潛水艦七十一隻、噸數七七·八四二、總數二百二十隻、噸數七五六·二四二、以上統計係一九三三年二月三十一日調查數字、（二）蘇聯、戰艦四隻、噸數二三·三七零、巡洋艦四隻、鐵甲艦五隻、驅逐艦二十三隻、水雷艇六隻、潛水艇十五隻、馬達艇二十五隻、砲艦二隻、掃海艦二十隻、河川砲艦七隻、飛機母艦一隻、總數一百一十二隻、以上爲一九三一年的統計、其中舊艦頗多、戰鬥力極爲薄弱、據最近消息、蘇聯在海參崴裝置軍艦多艘、並有潛水艇十五艘、小型魚雷六十隻、其魚雷多爲法國最近發明之新式武器、裝有魚雷發射管四門、重機關槍四門、有四十至五十節之最大速力、（丙）空軍方面、（一）日本空軍、據四年前調查、日本飛機數爲陸軍八百五十架、海軍四百六十架、據最近調查飛機的種類與數目、偵察機十一中隊、戰鬥機十一中隊、爆炸機四十九中隊、練習機三飛行學校、共計二十六中隊、（二）蘇聯空軍、蘇聯自五年計劃完成後、其理想之無敵空軍、竟然實現、茲據野口昂所著之「赤俄大空軍之威襲、」内所載、蘇聯空軍、陸軍方面有二十個空中旅、每旅有五十架爆炸機編成的空中爆炸隊、及六十架戰鬥機編成之空中驅逐隊、飛機總數爲二千二百架、全國配置四十八個大隊及六十個獨立中隊、每中隊有二小隊、每小隊以飛機三架編成、獨立中隊、以飛機八架編成、此外尙有十個汽球隊、三飛行船、海軍方面、有二個爆炸大隊、六個爆炸獨立中隊、戰鬥中隊、偵探中隊、以及遠東艦隊之水上航空隊、共計二百二十隊、分配情形如次、偵察機七十八中隊、戰鬥機六十八中隊、爆炸機四十九中隊、練習機六中隊、海軍機二十四隊、現配置於遠東方面、（烏拉爾以東）由新西伯利亞軍總管轄者、計有阿穆斯克一個爆炸中隊、伊爾庫次克一個爆炸大隊、伯里一個水上航空隊、赤塔一個偵察中隊、新西伯利亞二個爆炸中隊、斯巴斯可那一個偵察中隊、海參崴一個偵察中隊、據上述日俄兩國海陸空三方面來説、蘇俄的海軍顯然不及日本、可是陸軍方面、則日本又遠不及蘇俄、此外適於平戰之機械類日本亦難佔優勢、茲比較如下、裝甲列車、蘇聯三十八隊又一旅、日本未詳、裝甲汽車蘇聯十五隊、日本未詳、戰車隊三團、日本一中隊、電信隊十二團、日本二團、</p>
<p>戰略觀測　再就戰略上説、日本亦有許多不利的地方、該軍事家談、日本如與蘇俄開戰、在戰略上、最感受威脅的有三種、（一）爲蘇聯之集中攻擊戰、（二）爲呼倫貝爾之平原戰、（三）爲蘇聯之化學戰、集中攻擊戰、爲遠東總司令官加倫將軍與許多軍事領袖、如空軍參謀察德氏等所主張、這種戰略、是在兩軍戰事最激烈時行之、在戰鬥危急中、一方面以砲兵在固定陣地内與敵人作砲兵激戰、同時以驅逐機掩護戰塲、攻擊機襲擊敵人移勳部隊、以爆炸機攻擊敵人空軍根據地、以若干戰車衝入敵人陣地、再以空軍全力數百架飛機大集團前進、一舉而殲滅敵人、這就是所謂的集中攻擊戰、呼倫貝爾方面的平原戰、好運用上項戰略以制日本、日本最恐懼之平原戰、並不在蘇聯之有多量的陸軍、而在蘇聯之空軍威脅、故日本軍事專家主張、日本如於平原戰無把握時、即應退守大興安嶺、另以小兵力進出於呼倫貝爾一帶、以牽制蘇軍之前進、蘇聯之化學戰、也是使日本軍事陷於苦痛的東西、據稱蘇聯化學隊在每師團中、設有瓦斯主任一員一切師團及一切飛行機戰事團、均設有化學了隊一排、更特别設有瓦斯軍官及軍用化學員之軍事教導隊、其瓦斯防禦面具、已普及全軍兵馬、就産業動員、軍需資員、與國家財政方面説、日本亦難佔優勢、蓋蘇聯爲社會主義的國家、一切國内産業、均歸國有、眞可以説全國總動員、財政方面、因五年計劃之成功、已不感困難、軍需資源、以西伯利亞雙軌完成、已無阻碍、反之、日本因海陸空軍之擴張而陷於赤字財政、再加上國内的經濟恐慌、其財政益感困難、其餘如軍事領袖之統率力與附屬聯合之輔導、兩國互相伯仲、蓋日本雖可以利用僞國、而蘇聯亦不妨聯絡中美、日本軍事領袖雖强、蘇軍之黨員層、亦頗不弱、據云、一九二八年爲百分之二二·六、至一九三三、已增至五九·四％、日本雖有許多地方不及蘇俄、然而亦有優越於蘇俄之地方、第一、日本在東北鐵路網之完成、第二、日本軍需資源、不須取諸遠道、而可以直接取於東北或華北、第三、日本海軍强大、可以威襲蘇聯海參崴的要塞、</p>
<p>最後勝利　據上所述兩軍各有侵點、然則勝利將屬誰、成敗决於何處、據日本軍事專家平田晋所著之「赤軍極東作戰、」内云、「日俄爭、以大與安嶺爲主要戰塲、是爲兩國軍事家所公認、」故赤塔所駐軍團之任務、利在以迅雷不及掩耳之手段、奪取大興安嶺、蘇軍如取得此山脈、搆築堅固陣地、以攻東省、則日軍必陷入苦境、蓋日軍仰攻蘇軍、須受極大之犧牲、况大興安嶺多松伯、繁茂參天、所謂陣地戰山地戰、無一不備、困苦艱難、可想而知、反之、若日軍先佔該地、蘇軍亦必感受同樣痛苦、故若以齊齊哈爾爲根據地之日軍、與以滿州里爲根據之蘇軍、同時發動、一達山之東、一達山之西、則兩軍勢必演成爭奪山地之劇烈戰、誰能奪取山頂、即可以獲得戰爭之最後勝利、惟蘇俄一方面、尙有日本莫敵之化學戰、蓋蘇軍所用之毒瓦斯、爲一橙色霧狀、可於一週内不散、兵士須常着用防毒衣、被毒區域之草木、均將枯死、其猛烈亦可想見、他方面、蘇俄據有强大之空軍、與强大之陸軍、及足以致日軍於苦境之集中攻擊戰、與呼倫貝爾平原戰、所以結果、日俄戰爭如果爆發、蘇聯有獲得最後勝利之可能性、惟有必須申明者、這是就日蘇兩國現實物質基礎而下之論斷、至如參與其他國家或其他事件、則勝利之究將誰屬、實難預測云云、</p>

<h3 id="c133">天主教忠實信徒郁老太太被綁 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>看彌撒途中突然被綁</p>
<p>黄汽車司機同時失路</p>
<p>昨晨八時許、法租界西愛咸斯路江蘇高三分院迤西第六十號門牌、粤籍富商郁寳善堂之老主婦郁老太太、因乘自備包車、擬赴天主堂祈禱之際、突由迎面躍出綁匪三人、各執手槍、將郁老太太挾入預停路旁雇來之黄色汽車中、架匿無踪、汽車至中午十二時、始發現於高朗橋蘭路地方、惟汽車夫蔡阿毛、亦隨同郁老太太一併綁去、截至深夜、尙未釋歸、茲將詳情分述於后、</p>
<p>綁匪租車　本埠著名黄色汽車公司白克路分行、於昨晨七時二刻左右、突來不速顧客兩人、一着深綠綢衫、頭戴瓜皮小帽、一御灰色長衫者殿後、聲稱租車一輛、單送至北泥城橋珊家園、言時卽從身畔取出現洋一元、付給該行賬房、賬房卽派汽車夫通州人蔡阿毛（年三十六歲）駕駛租界照會第一二○三二號汽車、兩人相繼登車、直馳而去、</p>
<p>太太信教　緣法租界西愛咸斯路江蘇高三分院西首第六十號門牌、爲素負財名之粤商郁蜜善堂大厦、内有女主人郁老太太、雖年逾花甲、而精神矍鑠、尤篤信天主教、每逢星期假日、氏必往教堂參與彌撒禮、行之旣久、從無間斷、惟儉約成性、外出時僅以包車一輛（市照會三七五七號租界八○號）以代步、</p>
<p>綁上汽車　昨日又値禮拜日、氏於七時卽起身、盥洗旣畢、稍進早餐後、時已八時有零、氏極卽跨上包車、車夫陸惠祥、卽將車挽出、向東直拉、詎甫拉抵高三分院西首第五號門牌門口突由迎面迎面擁上綁匪三人、各出手槍、迫令車夫止步停車、同時兩匪卽將郁氏挾入預停路旁一黄色汽車中、風馳電掣向東而去、而該汽車號碼、卽係適才自白克路租來之第一二○三二號、</p>
<p>捕房追緝　當時包車夫陸惠祥目擊主婦被綁、已嚇得呆若木雞、良久驚魂稍定、急將空車拽回、歸家報告、隨由家人據惟、轉報該管盧家灣總巡捕房、再待捕頭大批中西探捕四面追拿時、奈已杳如黄鶴、捕頭急用電話通知公共租界及公安局各分警局注意截獲、但卒無影踪、直至中午十二時許、該項汽車、始發現於高朗橋蘭路附近、但已人去車空、卽汽車夫蔡阿毛、亦同時失踪矣、</p>
<p>推測之詞　是案發生後、據捕房探員之臆測、略謂當兩匪租車之時、言稱單送至北泥城橋、當時蔡阿毛必如命開到所言相近地方、然後將蔡誘入匪窟、加以監視、復由熟嫻司機之匪、將車開至西愛咸斯路守候肉票、否則察如同時亦在車中、必遭中途推下、絶不致一併遭綁也云云、此外尙有人謂郁之被綁、箇中恐涉有某種問題、此恐神經過敏之詞、</p>
<p>五年以前　記者曾切記五年以前、古㧞路四十三號郁公館之女主婦亦係天主教信徒之一、某次亦因參加禮拜彌撒禮、在法租界天主堂街教堂門首被綁、嗣後以重金贖出、此次被綁者旣同爲女性、而同爲郁姓、更同爲信仰天主教赴禮拜而遭綁、被綁地點又同爲法租界、斯誠可謂無獨有偶、嘆觀止矣、惟據一般人聲稱、五年前被綁之郁太太、卽今日被綁之郁太太也、但記者向古㧞路郁宅詢問、則絶對否認二而一也、</p>

<p>— 張唯樂</p>
<p>自碧眼黄髮的無色人種跟着他們的兵艦貨舶踏進了老大的東方古國以後、槍砲的威力固然可以使你低首下心，所謂物質文明的炫耀，也會使你不得不懾服。如是，只要他是碧眼黄髮，便會弄得你肅然起敬！只要是從碧眼黄髮的祖國來的東西，便都是無價之寳！可憐啊！失了自信力的東方古國的人們！</p>
<p>我以爲碧眼黄髮者的無理的倨傲，因然使我們心裏感到十二萬分的憤懣，但是我們自己太没有自信力，倒是我們一個致命的痼疾！一般知識低陋的苦力，他們要想多撈幾個錢來維持生活、我們且不去管他，最可嘆的是一般知識份子和所謂上流人士也都不能自㧞，找不出自己的信念來。一舉一動，如果没有在碧眼黄髮的祖國找到先例，就好像未經公認的私生子一樣，深覺得是卑而且鄙！只要是碧眼黄髮的祖國「早已有之」的，就無所謂高貴卑鄙，都不妨尤而效之！</p>
<p>嚕囌得太多了，我來舉兩個例吧：</p>
<p>現在昨行的所謂馬戲，我想和我們向來在江湖上所看到的把戲總差不多吧！然而以前的什麽把戲，比較高貴一點的人是不屑一顧的，然而現在的馬戲就是三四塊錢一張的門票，却是車馬如龍，門庭若市，雖然馬戲也不過是一些玩把戲式的戲術，但是碧眼黄髮的祖國來的，價値就頓高百倍了。</p>
<p>還有一例：我們的最高學府的大學生，也够知識階級了吧！在以前，我們也都住過一些學校，老生欺弄新生的事也是有的，然而這是少數低級趣味的學生們一種毫無意識的與動，一般稍微自重一點的學生是不屑參加的。現在可不同了，因爲這一種舉動最近在碧眼黄髮的祖國得到了存在的確定，那裏早已有了所謂「拖屍」的這一名詞。如是大拖特拖，拖到報館裏的新聞滿幅，這也够味了吧！我相，假若没有得到碧眼黄髮的文明的確定，他們該不會這樣起勁！</p>
<p>是文物的精華我們該得敬謹的接受，是文明的渣滓，我們却必須排除。碧眼黄髮者的倨傲，我們固然難免憤懣，但是我們却必須保住我們的自信力。若一味盲從，一味瞎捧，我恐怕我們在精神上永遠脱不出奴屬的地位，亦只有任碧眼黄髮的人們永遠高視闊步而已！</p>
<h3 id="c160">過去 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 周文</p>
<p>太陽從地平綫上落下去，電燈在房間裏面亮起來，啊哈一個呵欠，這天就算這麽過去了。卽使你白天曾經赤膊地在太陽下流過汗，或者挽着袖子在寫字檯前絞過腦汁，然而都一起隨着太陽飛一般地消逝，過去了。剩下來的就只是整天勞動後的疲勞，綴在那深刻着皺紋的臉上。</p>
<p>雖然這「過去」在時間上是過去了：然而從整個的社會的見地看來，那所有精力的累積，究竟在不斷的增多，經過時間的淘汰，先練，從野蠻到文明，從今日到明日，在不斷的軌跡前面閃耀着一條連續的光輝。這就是發展，進化。歷史的輪子在這黑土上從過去的洞門究竟已經載來了一天比一天更分明的希望。</p>
<p>確信着逼希望，站在「現在」的月臺去觀察「過去」，把那些成塊的經騐都投到輪子的馬達裏去，那末這「過去」所發出來的聲音，將成爲到明朝的謳歌，而不是一種甚麽無聊的嘆息。</p>
<p>然而人究竟是萬物之「靈」，每當碰了一點釘子，就會抱着膝坐在床頭望着那灰黯的角落，或者揹着手站在月光下面細視着那閃爍着星星的遠極，於是「靈感」來了，兒時在花蔭下面的捉迷藏，或者甚至因捉迷藏而挨過父親的一耳光，都成了他眼前値得追溯的美麗圖畫，深味着那些絶不能再回的殘滓，然而偏要去深味，於是皺着眉頭嘆息了。大盌喝酒，大口抽烟，第二天起來就可以看見他那一副蒼白而陰鬱的臉子。再轉眼，就背駝了，鬍子蓬鬆了，一步一步走向他的墳墓去。</p>
<p>高爾基在他的作品中，屢屢對於這些事實加以明確的指摘，在「曾經爲人的動物」裏面説：「世間往往有許多人因回憶過去而使現在的一切能力，和未來的一切希望，通同消失了。」在「折爾卡士」裏面也説：「記憶是失意者的鞭策，能給過去的石塊以生命，傾注蜜汁於舊日所飲的毒汁中，使一個人要悟起他的錯行，使他愛過去，而剝奪了他對於未來的希望。」</p>
<p>「過去」這東西對於個人，應該要像爛蘋果似地丢在你的路旁，就不要回顧。</p>

<p>— 草明</p>
<p>我十五歲那年春天，人們正在開始爲着蠶桑忙碌的時候，一個遠房的年老的姑丈病倒了，大姑母便跑回我家裏，得了母親的同意，把我帶回她那小屋子去幫她理家務。</p>
<p>關於大姑母和姑丈，我知道得不怎樣詳細，不過有一件事我頂清楚的：他們從來就在吵架裏過活，碰着就是吵嘴，分開時大家勞作，愜意的歡笑在他們之間永遠也找不到的。我常常奇怪着，什麽力量會把他們縛在一起活了幾十年呢？</p>
<p>姑母完全是個忍心的傢伙，我住在那里的二十幾天裏頭，她没有一天停止過對他的咒駡。彷佛她甚至連一點憐憫心也没有的。</p>
<p>姑丈死那天晚上，我才了解我底姑丈和姑母。以後，他們兩人底影子，常常在我腦裏出現了。</p>
<p>「你還是起來吧。」</p>
<p>睡在竹坑上給夾被捲着的我，被命令着。跟住一個低而堅决的聲音，「快要完了的。」</p>
<p>我努力睜開眼睛，在黑暗的房子裏找着那盞細小的火油燈。牠正在引領我那半光了頭，背有點彎的姑母在屋子裏周圍摸索着。</p>
<p>重病者底緩慢的呻吟·耳房裏蠶幼蟲吃東西的沙沙聲，佔有了這人鬼交界似的周遭。</p>
<p>房的角落，神樓底下，兩塊薄薄的木板上面躺着我底短小的姑丈，他那本來圓圓的臉孔，像給誰把肌肉通通挖去了；一付深陷的無光的眼睛，配着一個只剩了兩個孔的鼻子和上唇已經縮起來的嘴巴，喉管像壞了的喞筒，空氣困難地進出着，並且，顯明地，他呼出比吸入的時間延長了兩倍以上哩。姑母舉着燈在床前站着，䀹一䀹她底常常流水的眼睛説：快要完了的。」跟着便把那張跟天色一樣黑的棉被朝姑丈頸部一拉，「你留心一下子，我要喂蠶去了。」</p>
<p>我裝做没有聽見她底吩咐，一跳躱在她背後，一隻手牢牢地扯住她一個衣角，這個冒失的動作，使姑母得了一個洩氣的機會。</p>
<p>「没用的傢伙，我像你那樣大已經出嫁了。怕什麽呢？人終歸要死的。」她粗聲地説了，大槪恐怕我着惱，便又向我解釋：「你要知道，土地自古到今都是一樣大小的，要是誰都不會死，那，你想想吧，人不是要打架才胡地方住了麽？還有一樣丨世界上的金錢也是一樣有限的，所以丨」她抓了一把切碎的桑葉，仔細地放進蠶窩（註）裏。「所以，人是殘暴的東西，爲了錢就把同類抛棄了，甚至陷害了。你不看見麽？越有錢的人就越殘暴，那，你想想吧，這是什麽的世界呢？誰像你這樣胆小，却能够不受人欺負的呢？」</p>
<p>她頭俯得很低，用力非常輕地在蠶窩上撫摸着，有時簡直把耳朶伏在窩籃上，像跟牠們密語似地，服侍完一窩又一窩。她在一個頂接近的人快要死的時候，對蠶蟲還這樣細心的態度，使我非常奇怪而且憤怒。</p>
<p>平時，姑丈總是用這樣的口氣對她説；</p>
<p>「有什麽地方我對你不起的呢？什麽事情我都是搶先做的，七十歲的人還天天跑上桑基去澆水……有什麽事情我對你不起的呢，除了窮之外？」比姑母矮一個頭的姑丈，照例從背脊到腦袋一起俯曲下來，並且長久地繼續這種資勢。</p>
<p>聽見「爲什麽不喝你底酒？」或是「蠶蛾在呌你了。」的時候，姑母才不用粗重的聲音説話，然而顔色是更變得鬱悶的。要是她喝多了點酒，她就會發瘋似地不停止地低駡着，直到姑丈挑起水壼或者桑籮出去，她才做出一種毫無用意的痴笑，給我唱她底出嫁歌：</p>
<p>「橄欖樣青趕嫩摘呀，唉吔爹娘何事不顧幼女受凄凉；十五歲過門做媳婦呀，唉吔，</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>………………」</p>
<p>跟着，她便興奮地做着姿勢講述結婚的第一個晚上，她怎樣一手推了姑丈跌到地上去，後來，他那馴善得一匹羊似的毫不反抗的態度，使她氣惱到整夜都睡不着，第二天起，她便開始駡他了。</p>
<p>「他從二十九歲起便給我駡到現在差不多七十歲的了，那匹可憐的蠢猪！」她非常婉惜地説着。</p>
<p>註：以竹篾編成圓形，　如桌面，周圍起邊的，普通呌窩籃。蠶户多用來養蠶，簡稱蠶窩。</p>

<p>— 唐愷</p>
<p>我坐在靠窗的凳上，對着天空痴望，啊！這異國的黄昏激起我無限的惆悵，我幻想着我的生命，正彷佛夕陽的微光已給夜神擊退，縱然再鼓起全身的奮勇，亦揭不破這層暗晦，我已逝去的青春，實無留戀的可能，我曾帶着一片熱望在我未作飄流以前，但如今！一切的希望都變成泡影！悠悠地像枯謝的薔薇再無復盛的時光，更如山峯上積着數十年的堅冰在期待着溶化，唉！生活的皮帶緊繫住我的身心，我以菲薄的代價出賣了我的勞力！自由！我的血雖仍在沸騰着，但，事實却戰勝了一切希望。好兒有一綫光明？遠遠地一聲“Ｐａｒｉｓ-Soir”把我從迷惘中驚醒，我站起身對着桌上的圓鏡，我看見我的憔悴臉上淌着兩顆熱涙。</p>

<p>聖誕節到了，辛弟寄了一大盒藥店裏的糖菓給在達賽德的她的母親。對海格爾婆婆，他起先想花十五個銅板買一對長的青色的耳環的，但他怕她會不歡喜這些，所以給她買了白手帕。他又寄了一張美麗的卡片給黑麗德，他的阿姨，因爲在一個下雪的十月的一天，他的姨經過窗外見到他在打掃應接室，她呌他到門外和她談話。她便把一張有她新住址在上面的小紙條放入他的手中。</p>
<p>「梅特麗搬到堪薩斯城了，」她説，「所以我不再住在那裏，你要好好的收藏這地址，倘若媽媽無論何時需要我，你可以知道我在什麽地方。」</p>
<p>然後她在雪中去了，她穿上便宜的皮外套，黑色高跟皮鞋和青灰色絲襪，看起來很漂亮。辛弟瞧見過她常和不同的男人打旅館門邊過，有時她和喀士文沙賭塲的主人，或者比利山達里，差不多時常她是和一些傖夫模樣的人們走的，他們戴着圓的硬氈帽和鑲有金牙齒。辛弟記住她不告訴他看來她的所給的新屋號數，他把這張紙修放進他的袋裏，又回去做打掃的工作，不錯，他是高興見到他的姨，黑麗德的。</p>
<p>一個星期六的下午，幾個白種人坐在應接室裏抽烟和看報紙。辛弟揩過椅子，拂拭過，然後拿那些痰盂去清理。這工作不要他很當心，他用軟布去擦，他可以讓他的心想到其他的事。他想及黑麗德，隨又想及學校和當他長大成了人了他應幹些什麽；想及壞利梅丨丨他鄰居的小女孩，得了一件給白人洗碗碟的工作；想及詹米蘭丨丨鄰居的小朋友，他没有媽媽；辛弟又想及他的父母在另一個城裏做着什麽，或者他們需要他在一起。他又想及海格爾婆婆已經變成怎樣老，怎樣蹣跚，和滿頭白髮，她現在是怎樣在洗衣桶上喘息，但永不訴苦；她怎樣每個星期六等候他，留下廚房火爐的火使他在冷凍裏走了這樣遠路可以取暖，和她怎樣祈望他有日會成爲一個偉人……坐在這旅館的後房裏，辛弟老想人們如何能成偉人，那時候，他把痰盂弄得光亮而且漂亮了。他老着人們如何能够偉大。</p>
<p>這晚上要在應接室檢起報紙，給茶房頭到處跑，擦皮鞋，他工作應該做到很遲。在他放好痰盂以後，他弄出一點夾肉麫包和一杯咖啡來做晚餐，然後他要回去帮助差利，倘若他可能……差利眞是一位好的老孩子。他曾拿着僅一塊錢給辛弟做他的工作，和時常帮助他弄小賬，讓辛弟到電報局，或者給上樓的客人做一些其他零碎的不正當的事，……眞的，差利是一個良善的有趣的人。</p>

<p>兵隊繼續前進、到了一處、有許多農夫正在田畔築牆、軍官問他們説、「你們築牆、做甚麽、」農夫們答道、「田裏的禾苗要成熟了、我們怕小鳥來啄食榖粒、所以築了牆、防禦牠們、」軍官忍不住笑説、「笨奴、任你把牆築得怎樣高、小鳥也會從上面飛下來的、農夫們仍然工作、好像没有聽得軍官的話、</p>
<p>兵隊進了城、迎頭遇着一個人、掮了一扇板門、氣喘吁吁地走來、軍官呵叱道、「你掮了板門、做甚麽、」那個人説、「我要到遠地方去、家裏藏着錢、怕被賊兒偷去、我把板門掮了出去、使賊兒不能開門進去呀、」軍官哼了一聲説、「你這傻子、你若留門在家、把錢帶在身畔、不更穩妥嗎、」那人搖搖頭、只是邪許着向前走、</p>
<p>軍官領着兵隊沿街走去、見城裏的人民一舉一動都很愚蠢、便對兵士們説、「這裏的人民愚笨極了、我們倘若懲罰愚人、未免可恥、我們最好去報告國王、再定辦法」説罷、帶了兵隊、回到王宮、把所見的情形都報告國王、</p>
<p>國王聽了軍官的話、立刻赦免那全城的人民、没有割去他們的鼻子、</p>
<p>這部書發行以後、承柳詒徵先生對於上述課文、加以批評、他説、「國王應學歟、割鼻應學歟、羣衆使國王不得進城應學歟、扮作笨人保護鼻子應學歟、駡人笨奴應學歟、軍官呵叱應學歟、國王受欺赦免人割鼻應學歟、僕以爲不但割鼻等殘忍之事、不可以告兒童、即駡人口吻、亦不應載之教科學中、」（見國風第五卷第一期、及江蘇教育國文教育專號「國語教材之疑問」、）</p>
<p>從這段文字裏、可知柳先生的高見有三、一是「保護鼻子的妙計」、不可學的地方很多、二是割鼻等殘忍的事、不可告知兒童、三是教科書中不應該有駡人的口吻、</p>
<p>我現在答復柳先生的是：</p>
<p>（一）學習是一種刺激、刺激所起的反應、不外兩種、一是從善、一是去惡、從善就是模仿、就是學、去惡就是鑑戒、就是不學、教材有正有反、正面的教材、是刺激兒童爲善、反面的教材、是刺激兒童去惡、路徑雖異、同樣可以達到教育的目的、我們知道國語科讀書教育的任務、以培養閲讀的能力和興趣爲正目的、道德的訓練、當然不像公民·社會那樣的濃厚、但是像「保護鼻子的妙計」那篇文字、却也包含着正面與反面的兩層作用、柳先生假設幾個問題、意思是唯恐兒童讀了以後要「學」壞樣、其實就反面講、兒童讀了、即使不加討論、决不會學國王、因爲他們知道國王的暴虐是壞事、决不會學割鼻子、因爲他們知道割鼻子是壞事、决不會學駡人笨奴、决不會學呵叱、因爲他們知道駡人和呵叱是壞事、這四種認爲壞事而不學的反應、用不到旁證、請柳先生自問讀了此課課文、是不是起這種感覺、或請柳先生把這些問題去問兒童、看兒童是不是回答不應學、就正面講、「羣衆使國王不得進城」、其原因爲的是抵抗國王的擾害、國王旣不能愛護人民、人民當然要起而反抗、「扮作笨人保護鼻子、」其原因爲的是防止國王將施的暴行、國王旣是暴虐、人民在無權無勇的地位中、當然要設計解除割鼻子的慘禍、結果國王受欺（是設計免禍、不是欺、）赦免割鼻、就是人民設計的成功、這種事例、我們可以中山先生史實爲證、考中山先生從事革命、反抗强暴、四十年如一日、中間臨危避禍、也不惜喬裝變名、以留有用之身、爲國效力、可見合理的反抗、與臨機的應變、並不是不可學的事、總之、一部　裏、正面的教材、自然占多量、但略加一些帶有滑稽性（此課課文、根據課程標凖、本是内容爲文藝、形式爲笑話或傳説、不以道德的訓練爲最大目標、）含有去惡意的反面教材、以改換兒童日常學習正面教材的口味、並不背於學習的原理、丨丨而况牠也包含着正面的作用在内、</p>
<p>（二）人類社會的形形式式、「是」「非」「善」「惡」、是相對的、我們旣没有方法使社會悉　爲「是」和「善」、那麽「非」和「惡」怎樣可以不讓兒童知道、弄得他將來成爲「何不食肉糜」的一流人物、踏進社會去做一個知「善」知「是」不識「惡」不識「非」的超人、割鼻子固然是件不人道的蠻行、可是中外歷史上的記載、人類確是做過這種事情的、就是文明如今日、我革命先烈蔡公時、尙不免爲殘暴的日兵割鼻耳、挖雙目、難道蔡公時被日兵慘殺的事、也將因牠的殘忍而不使兒童知道嗎、要知「善」「惡」「是」「非」的辨别、非比較不能顯明、知「善」以資模仿、知「惡」以明懲警、在教育上、實有同樣的楠需要、</p>
<p>（三）「笨奴」「呵叱」都是壞名詞、但是社會上確有「笨奴」、人類的言談中也確有「呵叱」、如果這些字不許兒童學、那麽他如果遇到旁人稱他爲「笨奴」、或是「呵叱」他、他將認爲甚麽、我們没有實際的方法使社會上没有「笨奴」、没有「呵叱」的聲音、我們也没有將字典上的「笨奴」和「呵叱」等字、設法消減、那麽小心謹愼地不要把「笨奴」「呵叱」等字讓兒童知道、豈不是欺騙兒童、</p>
<p>平心而論、高小國語教材、所以不避笑話與傳説、是因爲比項教材、一方面足以適應兒童學習的興趣、一方面足以培養兒童閲讀的能力、並不違反而且符合國語教學的主要目的、即退一步而言、揣柳先生之意、以爲國語教材、必須篇篇以道德涵養爲條件、那麽如上云云、「保護鼻子的妙計」也不背道德涵養的條件、也自有其可讀的價値、若斷章取養、以一二名詞爲詬病、便失學者評論的眞誠態度、柳先生曾編選高中用的鍾山國文讀本、我隨便翻閲幾篇、發見了「車裂以徇」「而甚者至以爲欲復肉刑」「雖食議者之肉何補於民」（見下册蘇軾上神宗皇帝書）「烹説者」「豎子不足與謀」「項王瞋目而叱之」（見下册　�</p>
<p>史記項羽本紀）等詞句、倘使我對柳先生下一批評説、「不但「車裂」「肉刑」「食人肉」「烹」等殘忍之事、不可以告學生、即駡人口吻、嚴厲辭色、亦不應載之教科書中」、柳先生聞之、不將啞然失笑嗎、</p>
<p>答復的話止於此、我希望柳先生以及對於國語教學有研究興趣的人士加以指教、（完）</p>

<p>丨結果三與一比丨</p>
<p>東華得勝在前後平均</p>
<p>稱爲滬上足球兩巨頭之優游與東華、昨日下午三時會師申園、乃西聯甲組賽之一幕、就兩隊過去之戰績、目下之人才、其吸引觀衆力量、是必驚人無疑、四壁坐而觀戰者近八千人、當然應有之結數、雙方在形勢緊張之下、動作每見逾規、是爲美中不足、上下各四十五分鐘、彼此均占半部天下、前部東華勝三球、後部優游得一球、裁判沈回春處置適當、故各方得相安無事、</p>
<p>東華隊</p>
<p>陸鍾恩　李寗　陳公　　顧尙　　馮運佑　陳洪光曹秋亭　李義臣　戴麟經　陳家球　賈幼良</p>
<p>優游隊</p>
<p>徐亨　王樹森　江善敬　梁樹棠　陳鎭祥　雲逢　符和萱　孫錦順　羅海光　鍾育祥　鍾勇森</p>
<p>一家人相逼太甚　二隊人才、雖非盡屬登峯造極、要亦可謂優秀份子、有曾出席遠東、或已稱雄滬濱、平凡之輩、不列陣内、可以代表今日上海華人足球界之人物、允稱英雄好漢而無疑矣、惟人我之分太重、勝負之念更深、因是藝術上之表演、爲之减色、而一心一意、轉致於彼此防衛之中、幾次三番、發生激烈行動、然尚能顧全大局、無事而畢、終之、同是一家人、何心相逼過甚耳、</p>
<p>實力上顯分强弱　東華得力於前後平均而前鋒合作、亦較緊凑、優游内部抵抗甚强、前鋒衝擊略弱、雙方機遇相同、勝負之分厥因於此、分别而言、守門尙推徐亨、内衛工力相等、中衛綫陳鎭祥馮運佑可稱媲美、左右輔佐、東華較爲堅硬、鍾勇森在優游五鋒中最有作爲、孫錦顧受人監視、羅海光用非其時、鍾育祥能盤球、不善射擊、符和萱極少供獻、東華兩翼較爲活動、李義臣稱職、陳家球平穩、戴麟經靈巧　故、</p>
<p>七分鐘東華得球　優游開球未久、即遭東華打擊、賈幼良傳檄中區、徐亨迎上接住、符和萱得令反攻、顧尙勷截予戴麟經、一馬當先、江善敬飛步急追、球自底綫反趨中部、優游守門及内衛方注意於左邊、猝然光臨、爲之失措、曹秋亭恭候已久、一脚入門、爲時僅七分鐘、不免令人吃驚、</p>

<p>全省最高紀錄五</p>
<p>（南昌通信）贛首屆女子運動大會、十六爲比賽之最後一日、是日風雨交加、較昨日爲更甚、在一般人推測、以爲必定延期、乃各運動員、仍于風絲雨片中、凖時到塲、雖氣候冷如寒冬、而各人精神抖擻、鏖戰如次、以視弱不禁風之小姐、何啻天淵也、是日全爲球類賽、排球女中對葆靈、結果廿一比十二、葆靈大勝、籃球女職對助産、助産實力極弱、竟成四與四十九之比、女職大勝、當球類比賽畢、由東亞體專校長陳夢漁、派定畢業在贛之男同學、與來贛表演之女隊員、作分組表演、結果十比十之平等數、兩隊表演畢、東亞隊與本省籃球錦標隊（女職隊）再作一次表演、女職當然非其敵手、女職以三比廿九慘敗、然此亦意料中事、不過是「請教」而已、</p>
<p>滬東亞隊以在贛表演完畢、錢行素等十四人於十七日由陳校長率領返滬、聞皖亦來函邀請其參加表演、未知成事實否、</p>

<p>滿城風雨近重陽、是日朔風怒吼、細雨霏霏、公共體育塲中之觀衆、寥若晨星、縮手縮足、而一班健兒、仍單衣短褲、與寒風冷雨格鬥、九時許、開許運動、成績較去年進步多多、破華中紀錄者一、破全省紀錄者五、各情如下、</p>
<p>跳遠破華中紀錄　譚彩雲爲女職高材生、在本省女子體育上有相當地位、此次跳遠、以四·一三公尺破上屆華中運動會紀錄、</p>

<p>江西省會第一屆女子運動大會、已於昨日（十四）上午九時、在省體育塲開幕、惟是日北風大作、塵沙蔽天、殊爲减興、南昌各女子中學全體學生參加者、不下二千餘人、上海餞行素女士等一行十四位健將、亦屆時出席、到會來賓及各界觀衆、共有數千餘人、司令台之二旁觀衆、萬頭攢動、異常擁擠、開空前之熱鬧紀錄、茲將是日會塲所見、誌其花絮於左、</p>
<p>會塲儼然戒嚴　是日大會會塲、除有省垣社會童子軍維持秩序外、另有警察憲兵保安隊士兵各一隊擔任塲内警戒、故塲内出入門口、均有童子軍憲兵警察、保安隊層層守衛、有如特别戒嚴、四圍觀象、莫不交口稱異、謔者謂、此蓋大會籌備處、爲保護上海錢小姐、故如此小心云、</p>
<p>人人尋錢小姐　是日在塲觀衆、均莫不欲一見錢小姐以爲快、故塲中「那個是錢小姐」之聲、到處都可聽見、後適於行開幕禮畢、在塲攝影記者咸紛紛擁上司令台、包圍錢小姐攝影、二旁看台觀衆視綫、是時乃集中司令台、始見錢小姐羞人答答於若干手提攝影機之夾攻中、</p>
<p>名將當塲揮毫　大會前一日、江西民報因擬特聞一版爲省會中子運動會特刊、曾乞得錢小姐親手題字、書法娟秀、故是日塲中來賓及各報記者、亦紛紛求索墨跡、錢小姐落落大方、遂於塲中從容揮毫、或簽字、或題詞、不一而足、</p>
<p>主席調酒水車　是日適因狂風不止、塲中風沙撲面、令人目迷耳塞、大會主席教育廳長程時　、有鑒及此、乃於開幕禮後、急揮條向市政委員會借來酒水馬車一輛、馳騁塲中、濕潤泥土、然北風太猛、爲效甚微、</p>
<p>攝影員攝片忙　行營政治訓練處、以南昌女子運動大會尚屬空前創舉、意義重大、故是日亦到塲攝製影片、自始至終、收攝無遺、頗忙煞了一班攝影員也、（十月十五日）</p>

<p>— 朱仰高</p>
<p>宇宙間除了吾們用肉眼能見的動物植物礦物外，尙有一個世界，大部分非用顯微鏡的觀察不可，今天欲談的原始動物，（原虫）就屬於此，諸君聽見了這個名詞，或許要想到那類動物的狀態，究竟是如何樣子，這是我可以猜度的，原來這動物的組織，是非常　簡單，不要説牠們没有頭，也没有尾巴，統計牠們全身的構造，也不過是由一個細胞所成的，所以牠們也是屬於所謂的「單細胞生物」的門下，「生物」是一件「活」的東西，那末要問牠甚麽活法，牠們也能飲食麽？呼吸麽？運動麽？生殖麽？這些當然是有的，那末到也有些可疑，難道那一個細胞的效用有這樣的大麽？吾們人類雖是動物中最高進化的東西，但是在人體内，確找不到一個細胞是具有這樣多的生理作用的，這到也是一名不好聽的話，雖然單個細胞與單個細胞比呢，是如此，但是吾們人類的身體組織，惟因其有龐大的數目，所以就有一種團體的構造，（器管）統合了許多的器管，就成了一個人，來分工合作的，每個器管的細胞，有他的專門特技，好比木匠只會做桌椅，確因他從幼没有學過鐵匠，不會打刀，何况吾們的體内，已經備有鐵匠呢。話又説回來，我們確也不能不希奇那原虫的一個細胞，有這樣多的生理能力。</p>
<p>今天吾們先看看牠的細胞的組織，也是與其他的動物類乎的，（一）原形質，（二）細胞核，原形質的質地是一種膠形的東西，介乎液體與固體的當中，所以有此原虫在靜的時候，好像一滴膠水形狀而正圓的，至於講到他的成份呢，也含有蛋白質，脂肪，像脂類等等，除了之外，尙有牠們取自外方的未消化食品，空氣泡等等，這膠樣的物質，在與空氣連接的層受了空氣的作用，是比較的來得凝固些，黏厚些，並且成了一張皮樣的東西，這細胞皮向内的質地，也就漸漸地稀薄了，用顯微鏡來觀察牠的形狀，那末這原形質大都是好像蜂窠式的形狀。比原形質更重要些的細胞成份，就是那細胞的核子，如果吾們把菓子中的核子來比細胞的核子，那末菓子外肉的部份，就是好比細胞的原形質一樣了，菓子的核子，往往是比外肉要來得重要，傳種接代的主要能力，是藏在那核子的裏面，這是不消多説，誰也知道的，要曉得吾們的原虫的核子，恰好也是如此，原來原虫的繁殖與傳性的生理工作，也是全靠牠的核子來支配一切的，吾們只要把一個最簡單的一種原虫核子的作用，來披露一下，那末就知道一個原虫所能够變成二個，先要將細胞的核子分作二份之後，原形質亦跟得分化爲兩，所以主要的領導的工作會是操在那核子的手中，那核子的内部，根本含有二種質地，一種是傳性的質地，一種是運動的質地，這運動的質物，首先地有規則的把自己的質量分布在核子的内部，二端好似二極，中間好似一個磁塲，眞好像磁石力支配鐵屑圖樣相同，那傳性質就聚在這磁塲的赤道上，隨着這塲内的力量，漸漸地把全部質量平均的分成二份，一份走向陽極，一份走向陰極，分聚在二極的周圍，到了這個時候呢，那運動質的責任算是完了，所以牠呢自己亦分成二份，附着了二端的傳性質離了開來，直等到那核子做完了這一套工作之後，那末原形質方才一分爲二，變成了二個原虫。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c190">法官處理醫病訟案應有之態度 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>年來醫病糾紛，層見疊出，醫病雙方之相見於法庭者時有所聞。醫家往往於向法院辯訴之外，有將全部事實訴於正式醫學機關以求公正之　定者，醫學機關於接受此種案件之時，一方根據原被二告之控辯理由，一方再加以實地之考察，然後將學理上事實上所得之結論報告法院以備法官判斷時之參考。意至善也，惟近據一二被控醫師之報告，竟有少數法官，對於此等主持公道之證明文件，置若罔聞，其判斷主文，仍出以主觀之武斷，余始而惑，繼而思，然後知法官之武斷亦有由也。請略陳之。</p>
<p>醫學爲最高深之科學，醫師治病，不幸而病人死亡，其原因究由於病之不治，抑由於醫師之誤治，非深於醫學者不能知也。法院之法官其深明於法律固不待言，但於醫學，其爲門外與普通人無異。於此時也而有正式醫學機關根據學理與事實之鑒定文件以備參考，其於法官判斷上之帮助不言可知。語曰：「原情定罪」，此言法律僅爲具文，在用之者。能於法律之外再加詳細之考察也。故醫病糾紛案件之中，此種醫學機關之鑒定文件，在判斷上殊有絶大之參考價値也。法官苟疑此爲袒護同道之辭，舍而不顧而僅根據單純之法律條文，與病家之片面訴狀，則其判决之結果，雖欲不與事實與學理乖違，豈可得乎？此其一。</p>
<p>凡人於盛怒劇哀之際，其言辭多偏盪失中，在言之者雖出於一時之感情衝動，而聽之者則必平其心，靜其氣，以求其事實之眞相，非然者，鮮有不爲感動而隨以失中者。夫法者所以維持公理者也，故法字從水而解爲平，言持法者其心必如水之平而後可盡聽訟之能事，今之控告醫師之病家，其訴狀多沉痛感人之辭無待言矣，法官於此苟於不知不覺之中，爲其言辭所感動，則先有表同情於病家之心，而對於醫師自生不滿之意，同情與不滿之心生，無怪其斷獄之不能平矣。此其二。</p>
<p>在今日中國之社會中，一般人士，對於醫師，往往懷妒忌之心理，於醫師發生事故之時，口雖不言而陰以爲快者比比皆是也。雖然，此在他人則不足責。而在法官則必不可也。法官者必完全保持獨立不偏之精神，而後始能達大公無私之目的，苟其心理未能與流俗殊科則其斷獄之時已不啻置身於一般社會之立場矣丨此宜乎某某法官於審訊某某醫師之際有「爾輩醫生致人於死尙欲强辯乎」之語也。夫感情用事輕易表同情於病家或表同情於一般之社會，其於偏袒而有害於至公一也。此其三。</p>
<p>根據上述三點，然後知法官之武斷不爲無因也，吾人爲維持公理保障　業起見，對於司法最高機關之司法院司法行政部有要求者一事，卽爲由院部訓令各地法院嗣後處理醫病糾紛之案件，於宣判之前，當徵求正式醫學機關之意見以爲根據。至於法官自身，尤應保其持平至公之態度，而不得輕易表同情於任何一方，如此則醫界之寃獄可除，而法律自身將益增其神聖，非獨醫界之幸，亦公理之幸也。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（問）理學的療法中，什麽最有效？</p>
<p>（答）理學療法中，以洗胃法最爲有效。每日早晨和寢前各洗一回。</p>
<p>（問）藥物療法，可用那幾種藥品？</p>
<p>（答）藥物療法，爲防止胃内瀦留物的腐敗發酵，可用消毒劑，像柳酸鈉，薩羅，克列鎖，利鎖辛，薄荷腦，乙駢困　等，都宜由醫師處方。爲吸收水分和氣體起見，則用炭末，次硝酸鉍，白陶土，過氱化镁鎂等。</p>
<p>（問）可否行水治法和電氣按摩等方法？</p>
<p>（答）要想促進胃肌的緊張和運動，這些方法都可施行。</p>
<p>（四十三）　胃癌</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做癌？</p>
<p>（答）癌是一種惡性有毒的腫瘍，能使人起惡液質中毒而死的。</p>
<p>（問）胃癌是什麽病？</p>
<p>（答）是癌腫發生在胃臟的病。老年人最多；大槪四五十歲的人。發生胃癌的很多。</p>
<p>（問）胃癌發生的原因，怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）胃癌發生的原因，大多數關於遺傳的素因。又有從胃潰瘍治愈後的瘢痕，逐漸成爲癌腫的。有胃癌的家族中，往往世代遺傳發生這病的。</p>
<p>（問）胃癌的初期病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）在初期，大多數是没有病狀的。僅不過現輕度的消化不良症狀，像食慾不振，胃部膨滿感，胃部壓重，曖氣，便秘等。可是現急劇的赢疲，衰弱（惡液質）貧血等的時候，應該致疑於胃癌了。</p>
<p>（問）發生胃癌後消化情形有没有變狀？</p>
<p>（答）大槪像普通的消化障礙，生舌苔，訴口渴，食慾减退。尤其是厭惡肉食。食後胃部有壓迫感，膨滿感，時或呈持續的胃痛。胃内起異常的發酵，常常噯氣，又屢起嘔吐。</p>
<p>（問）胃癌，還有什麽其他的病狀？</p>
<p>（答）胃内出血，是胃癌的另一症狀。出血量却很少，要從嘔吐物和糞便中找出潛存的血液。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>（問）患了胃癌，有没有轉移到他部臓器的事情？</p>
<p>（答）胃癌很容易轉移到他部臓器的。其中最多的是轉移到肝臓。此外轉移到左側鎖上凹淋巴腺，腹膜，腹網膜，腹淋巴腺，肺臓，脊椎，骨骼，腦，卵巢，臍窩等處的。</p>
<p>（問）胃癌發生在胃内的部分，是不是有一定的塲所？</p>
<p>（答）並不一定有的發生於賁門，有的發生在幽門，有的發生在胃體。</p>
<p>（問）胃癌的診斷方法，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）視年齡，發病的猛烈，赢瘦貧血，惡液質，嘔吐，珈琲狀吐物，遊離鹽酸的缺乏，乳酸菌的存在，腫瘍的部位，轉移，等，就得診斷。但若欲早期求診斷，却很困難。</p>
<p>（問）胃癌應當和那幾種病相鑑别？</p>
<p>（答）　該和胃潰瘍，肝癌，慢性胃炎，胰腺癌，横結腸癌，十二指腸癌，幽門痙攣等相鑑别。</p>
<p>（問）這種病的危險程度怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）絶對不良，大槪等到特有的症狀現出之後，平均約一年就要死亡。</p>
<p>（問）胃癌的治療方法是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）應該常食容易消化的粥狀食物。肉類雖嫌惡，但也須給與，同時内服稀鹽酸胃液素。普通以炭水化物爲主食。藥劑，大都無效。早期最好行外科手術。胃出血時用冰囊罨胃部，試用止血劑。胃洗滌，每早晚各行一回，可防發酵遛度。胃痛，在不得已時用鎭痛劑。</p>

<p>（二）慢性上顎竇炎Ｓｉｎｕｉｔｉｓ　Ｍａｘｉｌｌａｒｉｓ　Ｃｈｒｏｎｉｃａ</p>
<p>慢性上顎竇炎多爲化膿性。故又名上顎竇慢性化膿症。或稱上顎竇蓄膿症。他的最多最大最容易發生的原因。就是在患急性上顎竇炎的時候。没有得到適當的治療。以致轉到慢性。這時候，上顎竇的天然開口處。卽告閉鎖。排膿的機能。亦遂障碍。竇内的粘膜。一般爲炎性浮腫狀的腫脹。有時變爲茸腫樣的變性。還有齒牙和齒槽突起的慢性病，不清潔的㧞牙齒，上顎骨骨折，上顎骨的彈創，上顎竇内的異物，結核，梅毒，惡性腫瘍等。亦都能引起慢性上顎竇火。</p>
<p>患慢性上顎竇炎的病况。最顯著而最感痛苦的。就是頭痛和神經痛。頭痛大都限局在前頭部。神經痛多爲上下眼窩神經痛。患者常感睡眠障碍，精神憂鬱，記憶力减退等症候。鼻腔常告閉塞。鼻内流出粘液膿性或純膿性的分泌物。而有腐敗性惡臭。此時嗅覺亦覺减退。膿性分泌物過多的時候。往往嚥下膿汁。刺戟胃内的粘膜。而引起慢性消化器病。如用鼻鏡檢查鼻腔。卽可察見中下甲介的粘膜。一般潮紅腫脹。中鼻道充滿膿汁。膿汁爲黄色或綠色。多向鼻孔前方流出。本病如果經過相當的時期。那就在中鼻道的附近。屢可發生粘液鼻茸腫（俗名鼻菌）。所以我上次在講」鼻茸腫」一節的裏面。曾經説過「鼻茸腫不是一個單獨的病，是别種病的一種炎性産生物」。現在大槪更可以明白了。</p>
<p>慢性上顎竇炎的經過。非常緩慢。屢有經過十幾年的時候。他的治療方法。最好由專科醫師詳細診察。鄭重施行穿剌洗滌。或行根治手術。（待續）</p>
<h3 id="c193">發熱普通治療法（四） <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>短期的發熱身體縱得不到充分的營養料，身體可以犧牲自己的細胞以作身體的燃料，可以勉强度過，病愈後可再補全已有的損失。長期的發熱如肺癆，傷寒，心臓發炎與較長時間的肺炎等症若是當病期間供給他的食物中滋養料不够，身體初則消瘦繼而由缺少滋養料抵抗病菌的力量减少。好像軍隊在戰爭時缺少了一切接濟，軍事是當然要失敗。生病缺少了抵抗力，輕病自然要成重病，重病將不起。二十幾年前醫師每以餓發熱病人，使他退熱。但近年來已知這種理論是完全不對的。今日由經騐與研究已確知發熱的病人如有科學化的飲食供給他身所需的一切滋養料，則疾病的結果一定要好的多，一定可以免去許多的死亡。就是同樣的病從前要死的現在用新法治療得以由死入生。有人問怎樣可以證明新醫法是對的，老醫法是錯的？據美國醫事統計，二十年前傷寒症的死亡率爲百分之二十（卽平均每一百人患傷寒症二十人死亡。）最近的統計患傷寒的死亡率爲百分之十。最近的治療法雖有種種的進步，但以傷寒一症而論最大的進步還在於病人飲食的科學化。</p>
<p>有人問什麽呌做飲食科學化？現在我們曉得一部汽車走一定的路程要用定多少汽油，機油，水。比方一部大汽車每十哩要耗去一加倫汽油，一部中等大小的汽車每二十哩要耗去一加倫汽油。一部小的汽車每四十哩要耗去一加倫的汽油。近年來由醫學的研究已知人身新陳代謝，生熱生力的作用與飲食在身内的作用，並且在一定時間需要一定多少飲食。知道一個人身量大小重量年紀，性别，就可知道必須用多少食物才能够使他身體營養料多少適宜。有機化學已指示我們什麽樣的食物是什麽化學成分，多少食物生多少熱，多少力。我們對於人身的食物需要幾與計算一汽車，一機器一樣。平常人當然以爲很奇妙，但這不過是近數十年來科學與醫學無限研究的結晶。</p>
<p>量食物生熱的價値呌做加路里（Ｃａｌｏｒｉｅ）。這個好像升斗量米一樣。一個加路里（大加路里）就是熱量能將一千西西（ＣＣ）水熱度增高一度（百度表）。食物的加路里價是用標準的電器將食物燒了，量所生出來的總熱量，以加路里爲單位。就是用這個方法計算食物在身内生熱的價値。一格蘭姆炭水化合物（小粉糖類）或一格蘭姆蛋白質可生四個加路里熱。一格蘭姆油或脂肪可生九個加路里熱。例如，一磅麵包可生一千二百六十個加路里熱。一個鷄蛋可生七十個加路里熱。一小碗乾飯可生二百多個加路里熱。一杯牛奶可生一百六十個加路里。</p>
<p>食物加路里價値旣曉得了，第二步就是要曉得一個人必須要多少食物才能够他的消耗，並且他在發熱時，發熱到什麽程度一定要多少食物，才能呌他不損壞自己的細胞：如何使他有充分的接濟可戰勝病菌使病得以全愈。由生理學家多年的研究我們已知道人身一定的需要。例如，一個人身重一百五磅，靜臥二十四小時需一七七○加路里。作縫工需二二四○加路里。作鞋匠需二六○○加路里。作機器工需三○○○加路里。木匠需三三○○加路里。石匠需四三○○加路里。鋸木工需四九○○加路里。這就是爲什麽一個碼頭上的苦力一日吃的飯比一位靜坐的人三天吃的還要多。上篇已講過人發熱他身體需要滋養料也加增。每一度熱要加增百分之十。一個患傷寒病的他二十四小時内需要大約三千加路里營養料。假設一天他吃不進食物他就必須將身體細胞變爲身體的生熱料。一日如此不大要緊。十日二十日滋養料不够身體自然消瘦達到極點。由此可見飲食不够必定减少病人抵抗力。如用醫學的方法供給身一切所需的滋養料則身體抵抗力充足戰勝病定多有把握。</p>
<p>發熱一兩天飲食合宜與否不關重要，但長期的發却極其要緊，因爲營養料充足與否與疾病的轉機有極的關係。還有一件須注意的就是發熱的病人都是胃口不佳，必須給他合宜的飲食才能有益。茲述合宜的飲食於後。</p>
<p>飲料（Ｆｌｕｉｄｓ）充分的飲料是發熱病人最需要的東西。我們曉得水是最好的溶劑。發熱時人身内血内充滿了毒質與廢料。毒質是由細菌而來，廢料是身内化學化用的結果。熱越發和高。身體化學作用也越多，廢料也越多。這些毒質廢料若被充分的水溶化了，可以由便溺，皮膚，出汗，或肺呼吸排洩去。排洩功用越好病也越容易全愈。反之身體缺乏水不能將毒質廢料排洩出去則病勢自然加重。除了這個原因以外水更是生命不可少的原素，身體各部所不能少的。如果少了就要停止功用。發熱出汗或腹瀉身内水被用去了；胃少了水就不能生胃汁，消化便停止。口涎腺缺少了水不但不能消化食物，連食物也不容易嚥下去。例如霍亂時因身内水被吐瀉出離身體，血内缺水致血液特别濃厚，血流停止喪失性命。水旣是如此要緊故須充分供給病人。給他水每一兩小時一次，不但不呌他喝，連舌頭頭嘴唇也不要他覺着乾。病人越熱昏迷越不曉得要水喝。自己如果不能喝水須用特别方法供給他身體水。病人最好的飲料就是冷開水。</p>
<p>如欲知病人的飲料够不够，可量他一日一夜的小便多少。一千西西（約兩磅重）就是够了。比一千西西少就算不够。小便越少身體缺少的水分也越多。補救的方法就是多給他水。有時病人不能喝水須用以下的方法加添身内水：（一）大腸内灌水使吸入身内。水内加葡萄糖亦可。一日兩三次。（二）皮下注射鹽水。（三）靜脈注射鹽水或葡萄糖水或葡萄糖鹽水。這些方法如用的得當有時有起死回生的功效。</p>
<p>合宜的食物　與飲料同樣緊急的爲食物。病人發熱胃口不佳，平常的飯病人是不能吃的。病人旣用全力與病菌戰爭故消化機能也非常軟弱。所以必須供給全合宜的食物，否則病人不能得到充分的滋養料。應當供給病人能消化的食，且富於小粉糖類，因爲這些是發熱需要的重要原料。注意如果給病人不能消化的食物反不如不給他食物。總而言之病人所需要的食物是（一）容易消化（二）流質食物類。（三）生力生熱的原料。（四）病人消化力薄弱每次給他較少食物。（五）病人旣需多量滋養料故每次食物較少，每日多給幾頓。每一兩小時給他一些食物，一日八至十頓飯爲發熱高的人。注意病人睡覺時不呌醒他吃東西因爲睡眠也是身體必須的。</p>
<p>以下的食物可照病人的食量每次給他兩三樣：稀的粥一碗外加一匙糖。橘子水或橘子。任何水果一次一杯，牛奶一次一杯。吃不起牛奶的一次一小碗豆腐漿也與牛奶功用相彷彿。鷄蛋開水冲，軟煮，蒸的，或生吃亦可。藕粉湯加糖。熟煮的水果，如梨桃等，西瓜水。檸檬水加糖，葡萄汁，菠羅水，米湯麵湯加糖。各種菜蔬煮的湯。冰結漣，鷄湯魚湯肉湯很好不可過多。茶或咖啡加牛奶加糖。應當給病人上等的食物。注意，腐壞的食物，無病人吃了可以成病，有病人吃了可以死亡。茶或咖啡不可在晚上給病人因茶和咖啡是刺激性易使病者失眠。平素飲酒成習慣的，病時也不必戒除。酒雖少有害處但在身内也可以生熱。病漸全愈食物可以流質漸增加柔軟食物，最後才漸漸回復平日的飲食。（未完）</p>

<p>第八章　臨床檢查法</p>
<p>（一）旣往症　醫者診病的法子，説起來固然是複雜異常，其實類别起來，也不過二件事情，第一是探問，第二是診查，本節所提出的旣往症，係完全由探問手續而得來的。怎樣是旣往症呢？這方面包括的範圍也是狠廣闊的；像病人的姓名，年歲，住址，職業，性别，平素生活情况，習慣，有無遺傳的疾病，以及從旣往一直到現在的病狀，醫者都應該不厭煩瑣，一一探問。肺結核是一個最複雜慢性的（有時可成終身病）病症，對於他的前因後果的種種，是不可忽視的。丨這幾件探問的事情，表面上看起來，似乎和病症本身没有多大關係，其實是醫者診斷一病症第一步開門見山的工作。就單拿肺結核來説罷。這裏面的例證已經是狠多了丨我們曉得，本病是任何年齡都有侵襲可能性的；但其中病症性質是不無區别的。像中年以上的本病，大多數是慢性型式，預後也比較良好一點；在不滿兩歲的乳兒，則爲急性，且預後極不良；在三四歲以上一直到十五六歲的青所，本病的侵襲係比較好一點，但此後的十餘年中，又完全不同了！這都是從年齡上不同而發生差異的。像多吸入有害塵埃的石工烟草工人，比較别人侵襲爲易，這是由職業上而發生差異的。大都市比鄕村壞，工業區域尤壞；卑濕汚穢的房屋比日光空氣流通的壞；這是由住址而發生差異的。關於生活狀態習慣一方面，也是顯而易見的。精神身體過勞的人固然是比較容易侵襲，有烟酒嗜好的也比没有的壞；這種實在的例證，大家都可以看得見的。至於旣往疾病的例證，那是更加顯著了。像軟骨症，百日咳，肺炎，肋膜炎，麻症，梅毒，流行感冒等諸病症，都是狠容易誘發本病的；尤以滲出性肋膜炎一病，幾乎是百分之九十五和本症相爲因果的，根據這種種的例證，我們至少可以曉得；醫者對於旣往症的探問，是一種狠有意義的工作，而爲診病初步所不可缺的了。</p>
<p>關於肺結核病旣往症的探問，除上面所舉的種種外，還有好幾件事情不可輕易放過去；這也應該在此處特殊提出的。像婦女們月經狀態，産褥情形，嬰孩是否康健，營養是否爲天然的，抑係人工的；旣往除本症以外的疾病，旣往結核和腺體病的標幟，現症的特殊原因，患者的經濟狀况，傳染的機會，外傷，最初病症的標幟，症象和治療的詳細經過情形；這裏面一件一件的實在狀况，都和現症的本身，不無前因後果之關係的；醫者病家雙方，都應該不厭舌齒之繁，而加以鄭重注意的。</p>

<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>一般作家在現代寫稿，大槪利用西洋紙，藍墨水；自然不需要把一錠松烟·再向硯池裏磨旋。而且用自來水筆寫字，的確要比寫一字蘸一次墨的毛錐子，簡便迅捷得多。我從來没有瞧見過友人中的原稿子上的字，再比東亞病夫曾孟樸先生的「　海花」原稿，（見于張若谷君處）更規矩更秀麗的了。曾先生在撰述説部時的端凝鎭靜，就可以在他每字如殿試卷一樣工緻的揩書上看得出來。</p>
<p>於是我推想到曾先生在他精緻的書齋裏，憑坐在明凈的風牕下，怎樣舉起毛筆寫着他文章的神情。書齋外的花香，微微地流動着，好鳥幽幽地鳴着，墨香輕輕地飄着，這時候，他正嚴肅地然而也輕快地製作着不朽的名著。丨可惜前年他六十壽的良辰，没有到常熟去走一趟。</p>
<p>而自己呢？每天清晨，也歡喜臨一點碑帖，如果一個年輕人可能養心的話，習練寫中國字是要算最靈騐的功夫了。因此每天晚上，寫作之後，讀些古書時候，一邊利用空閑的右手，就硯池上不費力地磨着墨，一圈一圈的打轉。</p>
<p>磨墨也得講藝術。至少武夫或暴躁性急的人，不能磨墨。磨好墨，必需心平氣和，神凝魂靜，才磨得細而匀，肥而清。再没有環境比在燈下讀書聞墨香的舒服的了。至若節省時間，助長幽趣，猶爲餘事。</p>

<p>當這時張學斌擺設擂台在大滬花園的消息，傳遍全上海，使我不由得聯帶想起了武術家王子平君在濟南歷險一段驚人的事蹟。恐怕知道這件事的人很少，雖然該事木隔十年，我在這裏記一遍舊的新聞，也算應時凑一下熱閙。</p>
<p>有一天，我往我的朋友金文濤君家去閒玩；他於武術也曾下過一番苦功，而有獨到的成績的，現在韜晦居滬，只把很有神效的推拿術替人治病以自活。那天，我瞧見座上有一位身材短小而堅煉的客人，膚色微黑，目射精光，口操北音，沈默少話，那端坐的姿勢平穩如鐵，丰神嚴肅，異於常人，没一會兒，就走了。我急切地問文濤兄：「這人是不是王子平君？」因爲我早知他和王君是極相投機的同道，他笑點點頭。談論武術的一切於是發生，而在叙述王子平君的生平中，我尤覺得「濟南之役」値得注意不忘。</p>
<p>那一年，王子平君被山東省軍事最高當局聘去，教練他部下一班下級軍官，學習武術，職名崇稱教練官。教練官非止一職，餘衆都很佩服王君，日常之間，一致對他表示特殊的敬禮。其中有一個某國教練官，未見王君有何特長之處，很疑異同輩所執的態度，獨自不服，表示輕侮。有人告訴他：這位王教練名震全國，着實有眞工夫的。他就立刻找到王君，要和他較量一下。王君爲人原是最和平謙退的，自認徒負虚名，謝絶比試。那某國人以爲他是情虚了，格外藐視他，在平日言語間，常有侵訕的口吻，動輒以互較爲要挾。終至有一天，雙方邀到證人，立下契約，如有失手傷害，各稱天命；王君在被迫之下，把那某國教練官一拳送命。</p>
<p>證人之中也有某國領事館的職員在内，他初時因爲知道那個教練官的工夫已經到家，决無生命危險的，待到他犧牲在公平的一拳之下，惟有懊喪，没得話説。可是有一羣某國學生，曾由那教練官兼職授武的，聞訊之下，日夕陰謀報復，原也懷有消滅吾國傑出人材的副作用。有人秘密告訴王君，教他預爲防範，他却以爲人類總講公理，斷無文明國人做出野蠻舉動的，所以毫不顧慮；實則他因有藝在身，自信足以自衛，也不免託大了。</p>
<p>一天，王君照常例到一家電影館去消遣，在電影開映未久，偶然回頭向後座一望，借着射放電影的光路，忽見離他座位十排之後，滿佈着穿着制服的某國學生。他心中立刻警覺，沽量自己單身赤手，倘有變端，如何抵禦，正在躊躇；不料電筒的光綫向他一亮，手槍的響聲突發。他虧得身材矮小，立把身子各下一蹲，避去了第一粒槍彈；接着像飛矢脱弦一般，他的身子直竄到前面空戲台上，竟然躍越過了近十排座位的人頭頂。他毫不遲疑地，在像貫珠的槍聲中，從戲台又一縱而登正中的樓座，足尖點着座椅背，三兩個竄步，已到了墻壁邊。他更不猶豫，舉起三兩拳，把壁磚打出一個大窟窿，稍爲後退一些，把身子斜穿過去，越窗跳到街中，飛馳而逸！戲館門首本也有一二個某國學生徘徊站着，只防對手方從大門裏逃出來，預備迎頭攔擊，那能料得有飛將軍　天而下，在錯愕慌亂中拔槍追襲，勢已不及了。</p>
<p>王君歷此險境，深慨某國國民性的不道德，纔覺得此後這濟南不是他的安樂鄕，也不願長官替他辦這弱國外交，忙着辭了教練官之職，悄然引去了。</p>

<h3 id="c204">中國的貨幣恐慌 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 耿愛德講　謝菊曾譯</p>
<p>自十月十五日白銀出口税率頒布之後，三四日來，市塲大起變化，揆其主因，實緣投機商人自相驚擾，無中生有所致，上海著名外匯經紀人耿愛德氏，於十八日在扶輪社以豐富之經騐，冷靜之頭腦，作剴切之解釋，所言極有價値，爰爲介紹於本刊</p>
<p>讀者，　　菊會</p>
<p>中國貨幣的恐慌，在兩三年前，已露端倪，而這完全受世界經濟恐慌的波累，一些不是中國自己的過失。當一九二九年末，世界經濟恐慌發作的時候，照我們的觀察，第一椿商品開始很快地跌價的，便是白銀。社會上有一種説法，丨這種説法根據什麽原理而來，我不知道，丨就是世界一切商品的批發價格，可以用白銀來代表，你看到銀價下降，你就可以看到别的物價也下降，銀價上漲，别的物價也上漲，至於這許多商品那一椿最先受影響，却是難説。但照我所編的圖表看來，可以證明上面的觀察不錯。而且無論如何，我們看到一九二九·一九三○·和一九三一年銀價的跌落到如此地步，大家不能不吃一驚，這個情形，是好是壞，隨事而定，我不敢妄加猜測，我所説的，都是公平無偏的話。在那個時候，許多擔憂的朋友們，堅决地主張施行白銀進口税，甚或禁止白銀進口，好使全世界不能再將白銀向中國傾銷，我即深覺這不是一個聰明的辦法，因爲白銀無所謂傾銷不傾銷，貨物或有傾銷，至於白銀，中國愈多愈好，那時財政部長宋子文氏，對此一無舉動，値得我們稱頌，結果中國對於白銀的准許自由流入國内，深受其益，接收下許多的白銀。</p>
<p>在過去十二年中，丨自一九二一至一九三三丨中國金融中心的上海，由海外及内地運入白銀約値五五，○○○，○○○元，不過我們裝到内地去的，却要比内地裝出來爲多。財政當局允許白銀自由進口的功效，就是使我們除了極少數接近紐約證券交易所的人士以外，大家都一些兒不相信竟有世界經濟恐慌的一會事，中國的批發物價，不跌反漲，於是中國成爲全世界惟一避免不景氣籠罩的國家，這個趨勢，直到一九三二年始終如一。從那時起，先之以一九三一年的英國脱離金本位，日本步武後塵，使中國開始遭受重大的打擊，後來到了一九三三年，美國也依樣葫蘆，於是我們感到影響一天嚴重一天，因爲美英的購買力，比先前减退。換句話説：就是從一九三三年以來，中國物價逐步跌落，把中國站在難於遏制通貨緊縮的地位。所謂通貨緊縮，意思是指中國連她那些微小的出口貿易，都保不住，進口湧旺，以致情勢日見嚴重。我不能説爲了貿易差額的關係，使我們立刻感受十分影響；但是人們見了情勢一天不如一天，並且很清楚地看見有些事情顚倒起來，於是他們便狐疑滿腹了。</p>
<p>我們眼見資本從中國流出。本來在先前幾個年頭裏，丨一九三○·一九三一·一九三二，丨此間許多外國公司，都保藏他們的私人欵項在中國，甚至於從國外匯欵到中國來。因爲他們説：「我們要守候更佳的匯價，中國是處在一個經濟良好的地位。」但是一等到他們看見情形不對，不容他們不開始着急起來，於是便把他的所有的白銀供給，搬回他國本國，或離開中國口岸　。僅僅不過從今年四月發端，丨一月到三月還一些没有動靜丨白銀便着手輸出。根據我搜集的刊布的統計計算，我有把握可以説中國擁有的白銀，至少當有二十萬萬盎司丨包括東三省及蒙古在内丨。中國在最近過去六個月中，喪失了價値二萬萬元的白銀。這數不能説少，但是我們若推想到過去十二年中中國從外國方面到手的白銀，値到五萬五千萬元之巨，還未見這情形如何十分重大。所苦者，就是到了這個時候，早已缺乏大衆的信仰了。</p>
<p>諸位時常聽説中國要平衡貿易差額，需要裝運白銀，我也承認有這個需要。但我敢説裝運出口的白銀，實在用以抵付貿易差額的，不過居極少部分，其中百分之七五，都屬於資本的流出。大槪一旦恐慌聞始，這類事情便很難遏制的。</p>
<p>中國政府對於這種行動，應否聽其自然，抑須加以遏制，便有考慮之必要。講到遏制的話，從經濟學者以及權威方面的心理裏，可以得到下面的二種效果。第一，就是保存中國現有的白銀。第二，就是止住物價的下落。中國政府對此問題，已經表現過極大的忍耐。因爲他們眼見銀貨流出，他們也承認資本流出丨，不僅限於外人，而且還有中國人運到外國去，。他們處在困難的地位，因爲如果他們任令白銀流出不加限制，我們總有一天早晨醒來，發覺我們都站在紙本位上面了。所有現在的一切紙幣，都不能兑現，一切貨物賣買，只有行使紙幣的一途了。</p>
<p>大約十天以前，又有二千五百萬元現銀裝出，另有一批九百五十萬元，也正裝箱待運。後來政府征税令下，於是白銀出口纔告停止丨，我不能説這是被禁止。</p>
<p>當局對於白銀問題，曾經有三種計畫，加以考慮過。第一，是禁銀出口，但這個計畫大家認爲不妥，我也以爲很對，因爲禁銀出口，或許釀成更不好的結果。第二，是遞加出口税，這便是目下見諸事實的一個計畫。第三，是一個極有趣味的問題，就是廢止銀幣，介紹金本位到中國來。</p>
<p>中國採用金本位，原是一椿極好的事情，但在眼前，却一些没有預備。大家回憶一九二九年甘末爾委員會對於此點的建議，同了他們認爲不能立刻，執行的結論，就可恍然。因爲中國没有心需的金凖備，而且中國各省還不能充分團結來實施這個計畫。</p>
<p>關於這點，大家就要注意到甘末爾委員會的重要了。因爲他們工作的結果，創出現行的金單位。這個制度，工作的很是美妙，否則中國財政早瀕破産，在一九三○，一九三一，和一九三二年當中，中國關税的收入，决不能抵償外債。但是此刻採用金本位，實不可能。即使最後幾時，恐怕也是不行。其理由如下：第一，中國本不曾儲有充分的金貨；第二，我不相信中國此刻能够獲得充分的金貨，來開始施行金本位。時賢對於這個問題，曾有許多建議。就中如中孚銀行的顧季高氏，主張萬一銀價極度高漲，中國不妨利用這個機會，售銀易金。這層意思很佳，可是實行却有困難。因爲今日中國所有的全部白銀，並不屬於政府的。</p>
<p>美國以及英蘭銀行裏的通貨凖備金，大家都知道是政府的財産；但是你一説到中國的白銀，百分之九九不屬於政府所有。所以白銀國有一舉，在眼前我認爲是不可能的。照我個人意思，美國受法律道德的束縛，在今後四五六年裏，要繼續她的抬高銀價政策。海外的銀價，勢必因之大漲。在没有想隔多時之後，銀價漲上七八角美金，一些用不着驚異。我想信中國或許有一天得到以銀換金的獲利機會，同時就些把她的幣制放在金基礎的上面。但這是將來的事情，我們需要計算着現實，以及討論現在究竟要遭遇那樣的情勢。</p>
<p>此刻遞加白銀出口税的最先影響，第一天市塲没有什麽動靜，但是到了第二天，第三天，第四天，就發生一種危險，這等情形，我很少見過前例。就本人而論，有不少人士，紛紛打電話來問我意見，我一律回答他們：「我不曉得什麽；我不想到什麽；我也不思量去幹什麽。　這是我效法二十年前的一位講師的回答一個問題，他的回答是：「我可以確切地告訴你，一錯，白銀是要上漲或跌落的！」</p>
<p>我可以一些不猶豫地説，白銀是要上漲的。於是一個問題來了，就是如果銀價大漲，中國將何以處之呢？我們現在除了國内之外，已經和白銀脱離關係了。我們已處在積極的紙幣本位上面，所以如果銀價上漲，我們必須很慢很慢地跟着走。但我並不希望有一高的水凖。照昨今兩日（十月十七日十八日）情形看來，便給投機家抵補抛出的空頭，造成一種恐慌。所以最好有一個健全的很低的水凖，但我並不相信此舉有助於中國的出口貿易，或是此種限度可以使中國免去困難。</p>
<p>帮助中國解决這個問題的方法，很有不少人建議。在我也有一個計畫，就是禁止洋米進口。如洋米進口可以停止，我想貿易上的逆差額，就可消滅。在過去三四年中，中國進口的洋米，平均每年價値銀圓一萬萬元。只要這個數目，已經可以充分平衡貿易上的差額了。而且照　看來，此事决不致人民會餓死。這是顯明的事實，中國一畝稻田的出産，只及日本之半，足見中國所用的方法和所施的肥料，缺乏現代科學的改良。不但如此，爲了交通的粳阻，運輸的困難，使中國的米粳不能自由流通。據説從西貢運米到上海，反比從無錫運到上海來得便宜。這些事實，都和我們今天所討論的問題很有密切關係的。</p>
<p>我們現在正彷徨於貨幣恐慌的中途，究竟我們應當即樣去幹，這便是一個問題。我相信如果我們把頭腦冷靜一下，我們可以很容易地回到一先令五便士或一先令六便士的基礎上面來。我想這個基礎，是最適合於這個口岸的貿易。此事十分容易達到。我請大家千切不要相信市塲上的謠言，相率捲入危險的漩渦裏。本人深信目下情勢，根據今天的環境而言，一些也不嚴重。如果明天有新的方法，新的法律，次第頒布，那末舊日情形，當然面目一變。至於此刻情形，一些也用不着驚慌。切望大家維持冷靜的頭腦，這是當前恐慌時期所最要緊的。</p>
<h3 id="c205">對於建設鐵路倉庫之商榷 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 吳紹曾</p>
<p>鐵道部以流通貨物開發内地，爲鐵路使命之一，現當内地農村瀕危之際，鐵路應就其本身能力之所及，以謀間接之救濟，因繼舉辦貨物負責運輸與水陸負責聯運之後，於二十三年五月電飭各路添建貨物倉庫。其原電要旨，可大槪分析如下：</p>
<p>目的　輔助農村經濟之活動，使工商業連帶發展，各地金融不致有偏枯之象。</p>
<p>計劃　注力建設各站貨倉，以收容農村行産過賸之貨物，並可以貨物抵押欵項，俾資周轉，使鐵路貨運日趨繁榮。</p>
<p>倉庫性質</p>
<p>（一）普通保管：專供貨主定期寄存貨物，略收保管費。</p>
<p>（二）運輸保管：專供業已承運而尙未運出之貨物，暫時寄存，不收保管費。</p>
<p>（三）建築時不必區别爲普通保管抑運輸保管，惟管理上應按其性質區分之。</p>
<p>辦理綱要</p>
<p>（一）選定貨運最多，需要倉庫最急，而貨商將來作貨特押欵可能之車站若干。</p>
<p>（二）預測上述各站最近十年内貨物出入囤積之最大量。</p>
<p>（三）擬具貨物倉庫十年建設之整個計劃，以備逐年依照施行。</p>
<p>（四）就本年需要之部份，按部頒圖樣，擬建築預算。</p>
<p>（五）位置要連絡，並能容整列車駛入裝卸。</p>
<p>（六）應顧及調車與停放車輛之岔道，使車輛運用得到經濟。</p>
<p>按鐵路所負流通貨物之使命，本不能僅以由起運站運至到達站即爲了事。貨物之在起運站報運而未克立即裝運者，鐵路不能不妥爲保管；其已抵到達站而未克立即取出或發市者，鐵路亦不能不妥爲保管。此種保管，雖目有相當時間之限制，不能任其長期囤積，致妨後來者之堆藏；然論其性質，實屬鐵路運輸中所包含之一部份意義，鐵路而不兼辦貨物之保管，無以自完其運輸之責任。此即所謂運輸保管，或稱短期保管，實鐵路之一種直接的業務也。若夫貨物之因不欲急運急售，而寄存鐵路倉庫，或囤積待時，以求善價，」或「抵押欵項，俾資周轉」。此即所謂普通保管，或稱長期保管，按其性質，實與運輸保管迥乎不同，不能謂爲與鐵路運輸之本身有何聯帶責任。縱令鐵路具此能力，可以兼辦，亦屬間接的而非直接的業務，凖諸事理，灼然無疑。况按照民法第六百十三修「稱倉庫營業人者，謂以受報酬而爲他人堆藏及保管物口爲營業之人。」及第六百二十二條「稱運送人者，謂以運送物品或旅客爲營業而受運費之人。」今鐵路乃屬運送人，自更與倉庫營業人有别。</p>
<p>基上論述，運輸保管旣屬鐵路直接的業務，誠不能不即由鐵路直接舉辦；則凡各路之未有倉庫設備者或雖有而容積過小，或分布不周，未足以供應需要者，自應遵照部電指示，積極添设，最低限度亦須以能適合運輸保管之需要爲凖。若夫普通保管之倉庫，供貨物長期存儲者，旣華鐵路直接的業務，是否亦須由鐵路直接舉辦，似尙不無討論之餘地也。</p>
<p>考銀行業建築倉庫之旨趣，不外二項；一爲經營堆棧事業，一爲辦理抵押借欵；在銀行闢一種投資生利之途，在貨商亦得周轉金融之便，故即謂普通保管爲銀行直接的業務，亦無不可。至鐵路對此普通保管，似可不必一定直接舉辦，其理由有二：</p>
<p>（一）就經費論，經營大規模之倉庫，費用浩繁，鐵路以運輸爲主要業務，所有資本當然應儘先投於行車設備方面，勢難以巨額欵項用　倉庫。况我國鐵路大率借用外資建築，其營業所入，除一切關支之外，並應還本付息，彌感支絀；對於擴充或刷新行車設備，尙不易辦，安有餘力及於規模較大之管通保管倉庫？</p>
<p>（二）就人才論，大規模之普能保管倉庫，其中如冷藏部之各種隔絶裝置，冷却裝置，換氣裝置；如卸榖倉之搬運機裝置，吊榖機裝置，磨榖工塲之清除機，混合機，磨製機，各種裝置；又如其他貨倉之壓榨裝置，打包裝置，裝罐裝置等等，俱屬專門技術。鐵路原有人才，大率偏於行車運輸方面，如欲舉曾普通保管倉庫，非添用專門人才不可，而此又非現有財力所許，苟以原有人才應付此項特殊業務，雖臨時之計劃督造可以委託工程專家代辦，然於經常之管理工作，即有難以勝任愉快之感。</p>
<p>故普通保管一事，無論從理論呈事實觀察，均覺與其由鐵路辦理，不若由商人辦理，而以歸銀行業辦理最爲妥適。惟在鐵路沿綫所需之倉庫設備，無論如何，終與鐵路運輸具有密切之關係，鐵路亦斷不能專辦運輸保管而置普通保管於不問。其折衷取决之道，惟有將鐵路倉庫分爲四大類：</p>
<p>第一類單純的運輸倉庫　在貨運稀少之站，鐵路所承運者不過零星之物品包件，客商所需要者亦祗有單純的運輸保管。此種倉庫，構造甚簡，費用有限，管理亦不費事，而又爲鐵路所不能不備者，當然應由鐵路出資建置，自任管理。</p>
<p>第二類混合的運輸與普通倉庫　在貨運比較繁重之站，一部分祗須運輸保管，一部分兼須普通保管。此種倉庫，可以一半劃歸運輸保管，一半劃歸普通保管；其屬於普通保管之一部，又可依貨品種類，劃分若干部分，以資分别存儲。此種混合倉庫，自以集中管理，較爲妥便，當然亦應由鐵路出資建置，好在規模不大，管理較易，費用亦尙有限。</p>
<p>第三類劃分的運輸與普通倉庫　在貨品十分繁重之站，有多量需要運輸保管，並有多量需要普通保管，即不能不分别建設運輸倉庫與普通倉庫。在此情形之下，其運輸倉庫部份當然應由鐵路出資建置，無待贅論。其普通倉庫問題，即有以下數種可能的解决方式：</p>
<p>（甲）由鐵路出資建置，並由鐵路自任管理；</p>
<p>（乙）由鐵路出資建置，而由商人租用經營；</p>
<p>（丙）由商人出資建置，而中鐵路租用經營；</p>
<p>（丁）由商人出資建置，並由商人自任管理。</p>
<p>惟在財力支絀之鐵路，恐仍以採用（丁）種方式爲最相宜。語其理由，除上述經費與人才兩項外，尙有一端；蓋鐵路沿綫普通倉庫如由銀行直接經營，則遇憑貨押欵情事，在銀行旣易於查核，可定放欵之數額，且易於處理，可有取慣之把握，何樂不爲。而在貨商則一方囤貨以待善價，一方押欵另作賣買，不啻以一千元之資本，作數千元之營業，又何樂不爲。如是不獨鐵路提貨單得以盡量推行，即其貨運亦必日益發展，殆可斷言。反之，若由鐵路自身經營普通倉庫，旣不能兼辦大宗押欵，即無以收此宏效也。</p>
<p>第四類單純的普通保管　此種保管，通常雖亦稱之爲倉庫，實則除堆存貨品以外，尙有下列各種特殊之作用：</p>
<p>（甲）中途集合，由鐵路允許託運人陸續將零擔貨品在所經過之地點集中，以備將來裝成整車，運至訖點，而無妨其全程運價。</p>
<p>（乙）中途壓榨，由鐵路允許託運人將乾草，稻梗，麥莖，棉花等物卸於所經過之某地點，俟將體積壓小後，再併入整車，運至訖點。</p>
<p>（丙）中途入倉，由鐵路允許託運人將米熶卸入中途糓倉，以待混合，漂白，去土，風乾，分等，裝袋，過秤重運，而無妨其全程運價。</p>
<p>（丁）中途磨製，由鐵路允許託運人將麥子等中途卸下，磨製成粉，再行運出。</p>
<p>（戊）中途裝箱，由鐵路允許託運人將油類中途卸下，裝入大桶或鼓形器，以備重運等等。</p>
<p>凡此即美國所謂特别運輪業務，在我國現時亦有此需要而尙未舉辦者。此種倉庫，規模極大，費用極多，管理工作亦極繁重，就我國鐵路現况論，决難勝任，則應由商人獨立興建，並由商人自任管理。</p>
<p>至其地點，約在鐵路沿綫距離主要生産地與主要消費地之中程，例如京滬路之奔牛及其他類似地方，最爲相宜。因其地價旣低，工資又廉，於此建設售庫，費用之省，較之無錫。上海等處，不可以道里計；且可順應需要，隨時擴充，亦較無錫上海等處易於着手。此其一也。</p>
<p>凡大宗貨品若由生産地直達運至消費市塲，在起運站已感所佔車位之多與所負運費之巨，及抵到達站時，如不能立即脱售而須寄存倉庫，又必感所佔棧位之多與所負棧租之巨。倘在中途有此大規模之倉庫及工塲，俾貨品得以中途卸下，零星者併合之，龐大者壓小之，米榖去其糖粃，粗花軋爲細棉，麥子磨成粉屑，銅鐵鑄爲條板等等，其保管及製造費用，均較都市爲省，而製成品重運，所佔車位旣小，所負運費又少，迨至運抵市塲，立可發市銷售，其經濟便利爲何如。此其二也。</p>
<p>就鐵路論，運輪原料品所佔車位較大，所收運費固較多，然製成品所列等級較高、雖所佔車位較小，兩兩相衡，即損失亦無幾。而依鐵路運輸原理，與其多運原料品，不如多運製成品。蓋前者多費車位，必須多備車輛；後者節省車位，可以一輛車作二輛之用，設備實太爲經濟，尤以財力不甚充裕之鐵路，有此願望。抑且一路沿綫有此倉庫工塲，百貨樂其便利，勢必麕集，鐵路只須敷設岔這以控引之，並定適宜運傮以招徠之，他項交通事業之競爭勢力，亦可不必顧慮。此其三也。</p>
<p>邇者，鐵道當局推行貨物負責運輪不遺餘力，鐵路而不妥籌保管貨物之方，誠無以完成負責運輪这使命。但細繹前述鐵道部電令之意旨，已由上述第一類之倉庫，進而謀第二類倉庫之實現。然按諸客商需要，恐尙不以第二類倉庫爲滿足，而期待第類三甚至第四類倉庫之興辦；似以邀請商界銀行界出資建築，而由鐵路供給貨運岔道等便利，雙方充分合作，較爲易於實現也。</p>
<p>或曰；商人夙抱貿利主義，若將普通保管歸諸商辦，則不獨此項事業被其壟斷，即鐵路亦恐受其控制；倘令整個運輪前途，因是而蒙巨大之影響，難免得不償失。雖然，此過慮也。蓋壟斷之弊病，大率爲獨家專利之結果。任何營業，苟其稍具競爭作用，即無壟斷可言。故鐵路祗須向沿綫普通保管之倉庫分歸數家銀行主辦　便决不至有壟斷現　發生。若爲簡　計，由鐵路商請各銀行合組銀團，即以沿綫所需大規模之倉庫，統歸承辦，比較更易實現；此種設施，銀行旣成爲集團，似難免有壟斷之行爲；然任何營業，莫不以盈利爲目標，經營倉庫亦不外是。如以盈利　，則定價愈高，交易者愈少，定價愈低，交易者愈多，此爲經濟學上不易之原則。是以開明之商家，必擇價格之最足以吸引交易而又可獲最厚之盈利者，定爲標凖。而最足以吸引交易者之價格，必非最高之價格；若定最廉之價格以吸引最多最廣之交易，尤屬兩利之道。况各銀行各有利害關係，互相牽制。故銀團統辦倉庫，即有壟斷之企圖，亦不至有壟斷之事實。不然，交易因之蕭索，所謂作法自斃，商人詎肯出此。</p>
<p>至於控制鐵路一端，更屬似是面實非。蓋商人旣在鐵路沿綫興辦倉庫，即在在需要鐵路之恊助，故其心理上必然充滿鐵路與之合作之希望，安肯籍此控制鐵路，轉致鐵路不與合作之危險。誠以商人之倉庫與鐵路之運輪，旣發生聯帶關係，惟雙方充分合作，方能達並存互利之目的；否則必至兩敗俱傷，商人熟計利害，斷不致見不及此也。然則鐵路以普通保管歸諸商辦，正可導鐵路與金融界合作之先河；異日金融界對於鐵路事業發生濃厚之興趣，再進一步，願予鐵路以種種經濟上之恊助，亦未可知。</p>
<p>現在鐵道部對於各國有鐵路原有倉庫之情形，現時貨運之需要以及將來整個之計劃，正在調查考核之中。爰就愚見所及，略書一二，藉供商榷之資料。其中疵謬掛漏之處，自知在所難免，是有待於鐵道專家及各方明達之指正也（完）</p>

<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>這眞得有些「駭人聽聞」的吧：一下子竟活生生地葬身在火窟中有十五人之多丨據報載死難者本是十四名，然而裏面竟還有着一位身子懷孕的婦人某氏，這樣連着已有七個朋的胎兒，總計確有十五名了；此外，更有灼傷的五人。然而他們與她們，却還是「一家人」呢丨？雖然這裏面是分着不同的族姓有八丨連「二房東」。前樓，後樓，亭子間，前後擱　，灶披　，晒台等，男女和老小，　　　　十九　　　但是他們終是共同在一所二層樓的單幢市　裏面的。這樣，就得在轉瞬之間演出了這麽一個大慘劇！</p>
<p>可是，在這麽一所小的房屋裏，竟擠得這樣的滿坑滿谷，不是够表示了上海市塲的「繁榮」，「人烟稠密」了嗎？不差，這里誠可稱得是「東方紐約」的丨？像最近報載據公共租界土木課發表公共法兩租界的建築統計：近十年來的建築投資共計有四萬萬六千七百元之鉅。去年公共租界内高層大建物增加有八百七十九所，法租界更增加有九百餘所之多。然而，在那麽一所單幢房裏，得住上近三十人之數，眞是够顯示出這個「東方紐約」的大都市，正在「欣欣向榮」的了丨？但是，在另一方面，要是我們更注意一下，那末，將得使人有些失望的了。這里，同樣據着公共租界工部局財務處的統計，單只共公租界内的空房，到　　　　　　　　　千三百八十三幢之多　　　二十一年同期是四千六百八十　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　月貘　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　七幢。然要是跟法租界與南市等地方的空屋都統計起來，則恐不下於萬數的吧！</p>
<p>在這樣的相形對照之下，我們就得知道；一方面，在今日的都市裏，建築丨與地産的投資仍不失是一般企業家們的良好的經營部門之一。然而，在另一方面，却因爲外受着各資本帝國主義者多面的侵略，「世界經濟恐慌」的影響；内受着農村經濟破産，市塲凋落，以及種種，「不景氣」的現象，祗有日趨於普遍化，深鋭化。這樣，高層的空樓，是得任牠們成千成萬地增排起來丨以表示「東方紐约」的繁榮？</p>

<p>— 哲人</p>
<p>（一）謙卑的感慨</p>
<p>世紀進行的速度眞是太快了，猛烈地被擲到十字街頭來，捲在四面，方衝轚過來的種種問題裏邊，只覺得自己是在生活的激流裏連脚都站不住，儘在漩渦裏邊浮現着。大槪不久就會溺死了吧？在萬花筒似的，繽紛的人生相前面，自己是太脆弱了。可是能把人磨練成耐勞忍辱的駱駝的，一方面是人生的苦難，在另一方面不就是人類的祖先遺留下來的那些閃耀着睿智的光芒的書籍麽？爲着想使自己堅强一點，對於一間滿藏了圖書的，樸素的書齋是很久以前就渴慕着的。這不是奢侈的希望，我不想要珍貴的文具，華麗的藏書架，我所説的書齋只是一間斗室，一引柳木的桌子，幾架心愛的書，一枝向筆，一瓶墨水和幾張粗紙而已。我的慾念也是很謙卑的，如果能煮起一壼咖啡，在桌上點了一盤安息香，每天給我二小時，不讓一件事來煩擾我，給我一此安靜，讓我怡然和書本相對，那將是怎樣一種幸福啊！人是除了　給社會的時間，　力以外是應該留一些時間和精力下來給自己享用的；可是這殘酷的世界上，除了爲生活而消費，不，我是説爲了必需的生存而浪費了的時間與精力而外，還有多少能保存給自己做一點非職業的，爲自己所愛好着的事呢？</p>
<p>那樣渺小的幸福，我們薪給生活者也是被奪去了的</p>
<p>自己幾年來的夢想只是想在這茫茫塵世中建築起自己的小天地，建築起一個書齋來。眞是可憐到想把自己的生活合意支配一下的能力都没有的動物，不斷的努力，結果還只是一隻舊桌子，半架鷄零狗碎，什麽都有的舊書。對於這一點東西，實在也是滿足了的，如果能有坐到桌子前去，由我自己的意志，把這本書翻一翻一翻，把那本書挪一挪的話。雖然是那樣容易做到的事，却到如今也没做到。只是在路上，在車上，爲衣食而奔走時，才能偷閒怱怱地讀了一些書。</p>
<p>爲了這，我是對於人生抱了咀咒的態度的。兩小時消磨在書齋裏的鐘點總應該給我吧。</p>
<p>那也不是我一個人的情形如此，和我同病的，在我週圍的一羣裏是很多很多，甚至於有比我還惡劣的，只有友人某君是例外。他是個獨身者，在他的寓所裏，和旁人完全不同地把一間不到一方丈的小房間做了臥室，却把一間軒朗而寛大的却佈置成了精緻的書齋，那究竟因爲他是一個智識份子吧。每次走進他的書齋，看見了滿壁圖書，站在書架前面，一本本地翻了過去時，羨妬的心緒總不由自主地湧了上來。等我在書桌旁的沙發上坐了下來，拿着那隻水晶製的獅形的紙鏡放在手裏揣玩，某君就會得意地笑起來。</p>
<p>對於那樣的笑，有什麽法子呢？只有從心底裏無可奈何地太息着吧。於是某君照例丨丨</p>
<p>「想　　年來的心血和收入全化在這上面了呢！」以那樣的　開了頭，瑣屑地講起他怎樣用七毛錢　舊書　裏把朱伊斯的優力顯斯買了來，怎樣爲了那本精裝的　　　的一　　　　　節省了半個月的車錢等等的話。</p>
<p>這樣的　事，他已經在我前面請了五六遍，可是每次我跨進他的書齋，他還是來不厭　　再　　　　　頭我也會從這陳舊的放事裏找出新的趣　，新的</p>

<p>— 列</p>
<p>雖説在上海混跡已是整七年了，但你若驟然問我一聲，「上海究竟怎樣」？我却是嗒然無以爲對。這就是我收讀你的信已有二星期了，還擱置在案頭未覆的原故。今天大雨之後，我佇立在窗前，望飛雲而懷想故人，復又轉到未回朋友的信的歉疚，於是我聚精凝神的把「上海究竟怎樣？一問語週而復始的想上了十來遍，佔時二十八分五秒鐘强，還不能作一正確而肯定的答案。</p>
<p>上海好麽？我固不敢貿然肯定；上海壞麽？我却也有六成以上的不同意。上海呀，依我看來，實飽有像用辯證法剖解現象的味兒。這話是怎麽説的呢？我們知道，上海是失業者層的麕集所，却也有不少謀業的機會；上海能逼死人，却也能救活人；有黑暗面，也有光明面；有歹人，也有好人，這是我七年來對上海的認識，也算是對它一句籠統的批評。</p>
<p>你又問「可不可以來上海？來了可免於挨餓麽？」我只有作一滑稽的答語「挨餓惟汝，不挨餓也惟汝」，</p>
<p>從某一方面看去，上海是個萬目睽睽的職業掠奪塲，你掠我奪，還不過是爲的「僧多粥少」「人浮於事」。於是便零零碎碎的昨日一個今日兩個，或跳躍黄浦，或服毒自盡，或……送命雖不一致，數目却極可驚。這自殺者流，當然是上海之所以爲上海的一個露骨的説明。其次，還有多少人生機未絶，正在失業的極度苦痛中掙扎，探頭探首，終年謀不到一差半職，終日撈不到一勺粥水。於是乞丐充斥，餓莩載道，不死於自殺，也死於餓斃，</p>
<p>另一種説法，上海却也是個活的上海，一個人只要有一藝之長，而又巧遇着機會，那是很能生活下去的。而且有時更能飛黄騰達，雄踞一方，遠之如哈同，葉澄衷，近之如某某，ＸＸ，輩，皆是在這上海赤手空拳舞起來的。自然，更有有力者看重你，提携你，使你不至於餓，不至於失業，而能生活，而能發展。回頭看看，拾此香烟屁股，或在垃圾堆裏尋生活的，也大有其人。至若那般流氓癟癟三亦能優裕的度他們的日子。總之，上海是很能混，卽使是失業，也一樣很能混；若是本身健全，而又遇着一些機會，那更是好混了。</p>
<p>據我看，上海就是這樣的一個上海，你來嗎？我不阻當，你不來嗎我亦不勸駕？</p>

<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>三年前曾寫過這麽一首小詩，到現在躺在病榻上，又把它想起來了。</p>
<p>想不到時間雖然飛越了三年，而一切依舊，所謂進步，大槪祗是貧與病在進步呢？</p>
<p>三年之後又怎樣？我不敢再想下去了。可是在病榻上，當輾轉失眠的時候，這樣的思潮禁不起又會冷了起來的。</p>
<p>在我們這一輩做一天喫三餐的窮小子，體健如牛的時候，還免强的能應付過去，但是一旦病了，别説醫藥費用得張羅起來，就是這個肚子吧，也得想法子纔得把它塡飽，所以，一面喝着苦計的時候，一面在擔心着這筆債何時纔償還得了。</p>
<p>朋友是有的，肯通財的朋友也的確不少，不過，富有的朋友可不多，有的也早已顧赫地去享受榮華富貴，結交别的闊朋友去了，留餘下來肯通財的，便祗有和自己一樣窮的朋友，喫了今天的，得準備明天開火倉的錢從那兒來。</p>
<p>病中，情感變得失常的脆弱了，非常容易動怒，也往往會莫名其妙的流起淚來，但是不知怎樣的一來，又覺得什麽事都無謂了，不想喝藥，祗靜靜的等待着嘗試死的滋味。但一發覺了抽屜裏祇剩下幾個銅子，又得從箱子裏揀一時用不到的衣服去換錢的時候，却又不得不坐了起來握起筆管在白紙上書黑字了。</p>
<p>這情感的變幻比秋雲還難測的時候，首當其衝的自然是妻子，一些極微小的不當意，便會惹起我莫名的怒火的，妻子在這樣情况下没有反抗，也没有回答，祇是像一個被擒的俘虜那般的，低頭不語，或是，背過身去用手帕偷偷地揩去她的淚珠，待到我的怒氣過後，他悄悄地坐在床邊，出神地想，或是出神地望着窗外的秋雲，過後，當她的，情感平復的時候，又凑到耳畔來問：「想喫什麽嗎？你！」</p>
<p>一面，便伸手到抽屜裏去數她的錢待到妻子的背影在眼前消失的時候，我時常會没來由的悵惘起來。</p>

<p>(Fuzhou) Military sources report that 50,000 to 60,000 remnant bandits are currently gathered between Ruijin, Gucheng, and Huichang, and are planning to break through and escape. There are no longer any main bandit forces in Changting, and the direct assault on Tingzhou and Ruijin has begun. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) A person from the front lines reported that the army is stationed in Hetian, and the outposts are in Cai Fenxi, dealing with the aftermath in the recovered area and building roads. The bandit area's supplies were previously imported from the Ting River, transferred from Tingzhou to Jiangxi. After the capture of Hetian, the supply line was interrupted due to the location bordering the Ting River, completing the blockade. The bandit area's supplies are now completely cut off, which alone is enough to spell the bandits' doom. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) After our army recovered Hetian, Caifang, and other places, it actively handled local rehabilitation. The political training office of the Ninth Division established a refugee camp and reformatory in Hetian, started a Baojia training class, organized a special task force and a military postal agency, and convened representatives from various villages to discuss the establishment of village offices and a district clearing committee, all of which have been established in succession. Many refugees have returned to their villages, deeply hating the bandits. The special task force has captured several important bandits in Hetian and is currently interrogating them. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The highest-ranking communist bandits believe that they cannot gain a foothold in Changting due to the attacks from our northeast and other armies, and are indeed preparing to break through, assault western Jiangxi, and retreat to the border between Hubei and Sichuan. The front line has been moved to the Jie Ling, the border between Ruijin and Changting, where fortifications have been erected, seemingly intending to resist there and cover the retreat. Now, the Eastern Route Army's divisions have completed their military deployment to attack Tingzhou, and Tingzhou City can be captured in one fell swoop by the end of this month. Chiang Ting-wen has been traveling by plane between Zhangzhou, Xiamen, Longyan, and Xinxing for days to handle official business, and will soon move to the front line to supervise the suppression. The blockhouses on the Pengkou-Hetian highway are expected to be completed around the 25th. Feicomm terrorists occasionally appear on the Bijiashan Mountain southwest of Jiuxian Town in Shanghang, which is the roaming ground of the 72nd Regiment of the fake 24th Division. The mountain is the intersection of the defense zones of the southeast armies. Strong units have been ordered to move in and search and suppress them. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Yin Rugeng Arrives in Beiping to Talk About the Inspection of Eastern Tombs <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Acceptance Period Will Be At The Beginning Of Next Month</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng returned to Beiping from Tianjin this morning. According to him, he and Chaisan inspected the Eastern Tombs. After setting off, they passed through Tongzhou, Sanhe, Malanyu, and reached the Eastern Tombs. After inspecting for a week, they went to Zunhua, stayed there briefly, and then went to Yutian and Fengrun, passing through Tangshan to Tianjin. Due to inconvenient transportation, the time was delayed for a long time. The result of the inspection is that the Eastern Tombs have been severely damaged. The Eastern Tombs used to be known as a sea of trees, but now there are only a few tree roots left. Residents still dig up tree roots for fuel. The surrounding wall is about 140 miles long and has become a ruin. If you want to repair it, it will cost about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. The Cixi Mausoleum, Shunzhi Mausoleum, Zhaoxi Mausoleum, etc. have been completely robbed. The windows and walls of the palaces are also incomplete and chaotic. This is all due to poor storage. Now that the storage committee has been reorganized, it will be formally established after acceptance. It is expected that the acceptance matter with Chai Shang will be realized at the beginning of next month. People are being summoned in Mayu to build roads so that the acceptance can be carried out smoothly. The scattered bandits in Yutian and Zunhua can be eliminated and are not a concern. I will visit Huang to report on the inspection process and ask for specific measures for acceptance, and attend the Hebei Provincial Administrative Conference on the 24th. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Ministry of Finance Orders Investigation of Unregistered Banks in Shanghai <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>A Decision to Ban Those with Unstable Funds</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the China Industrial and Commercial Bank announced its liquidation, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to send personnel to investigate. According to the report, the reason for the bank's liquidation was the failure of the so-called Jockey Club operation, as well as insufficient capital and poor turnover. The Ministry has previously issued a notice prohibiting banks from speculation, but the bank has resumed speculation in the business of the exchange and set up a Jockey Club, which is inappropriate. Now there are many small banks in Shanghai, absorbing deposits without any guarantee, and most of them are not registered. It has been decided to order the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to investigate in detail the banks that have not been registered by the Ministry, order them to register, and send a letter to the Shanghai Banking Association to investigate the funds and business conditions of the unregistered banks. Those with unstable funds will be banned to avoid harming society. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Chen Changheng Discusses the Silver Export Tax Case <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Cost of Imported Foreign Goods Has Increased</p>
<p>Various Trades Will Be Affected</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Economist Chen Changheng said that China's economic crisis has been serious for a long time. Because people have not felt the pain, they have mostly ignored it. Since the US government began to buy silver, China's limited silver reserves have experienced unlimited overflow. Therefore, various remedial measures have emerged, including the imposition of a silver export balancing tax. However, the imposition of silver export tax cannot prohibit the export of silver. Tax increase and export ban are two different things. The tax increase can only prohibit the unlimited export of general profiteers and speculators, and cannot stop the outflow of silver. Silver exports have already been harmful to our country, so why not directly ban silver exports? We have to review the current situation of our country. 1. Hundreds of millions of yuan of imports every year must be paid in cash and silver. 2. There are many foreign banks established in our country. Since they have absorbed a large amount of cash silver, if they want to export it at any time, the government is not convenient to forcibly prevent it. Since silver exports have been taxed, the payment of a large amount of cash silver is of course also subject to taxation. Previously, foreign rice cost four yuan per bag. At this time, it must be increased by export tax beyond four yuan. This kind of excess will inevitably be compensated by imported goods and consumers. The cost of imported foreign goods has increased, and domestic goods will inevitably increase in price. As a result, the burden of the people's purchasing power is increased. Under these circumstances, various trades are naturally affected. For example, the prices of gold, yarn, flower rice, and wheat in Shanghai have risen sharply recently, all due to the increase in silver export tax and the increase in gold prices. According to a certain person in the financial sector, the unprecedented changes in market prices recently are caused by general speculative merchants, and it is expected that it will be difficult to last. In addition, the increase in silver export tax has also caused drastic changes in the foreign exchange market. In view of this, the government has specially established a market stabilization agency to stabilize domestic finance and international exchange rates. However, this kind of organization must have a large amount of funds to be effective. As for the exchange of US dollars and Chinese silver, the United States has no definite expression, whether it agrees or not, depends on how much silver our country can exchange for US dollars. It is doubtful. If there is indeed a surplus available for exchange, why not concentrate it for safekeeping as a reserve and issue value vouchers to circulate on the market? However, judging from the government's financial resources, it is not the time yet. Therefore, the better plan to prepare for the current situation is to reorganize the currency system so that Shanghai's silver coins can flow into the mainland, and the mainland's cash will no longer be concentrated in Shanghai, creating an opportunity for export. At the same time, promote domestic goods and reduce imports. This is the method of drawing salary from the bottom of the pot. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<p>Facilities Are Perfect in Guangxi</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Peng, Counselor of the Ministry of Justice, returned from inspecting judicial affairs in the southwestern provinces. He said that he left Beijing in June to inspect judicial affairs in Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi. He visited no fewer than fifty important places. In Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, due to natural and man-made disasters in recent years, the provincial treasuries were in short supply, resulting in dilapidated prisons and a large number of criminal and civil offenders. Because of financial difficulties, the personnel in various offices have no spirit to do things, and cases are piling up. If no reforms are made to appease the people, the future of justice will be bleak. Guangxi has been praised as a model province due to its perfect facilities. In recent years, Chairman Huang Xuchu has strived to develop transportation in various counties and open up highways without interruption. Internal affairs can be said to have entered a bright path, so justice is also better than the three provinces mentioned above. There are very few criminal cases and not many civil cases. The equipment and management in prisons are better than those in the interior. This inspection was made to inspect the actual situation in the above-mentioned places, and can only be reported to the Ministry. As for the reform steps, the Ministry will plan them. The inspection report is being compiled and will be submitted to the Ministry for reference in future reforms. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to news from outside the pass, after Wang Delin secretly returned to the Northeast from Hong Kong, he gathered his old troops of the Righteous Army and lurked in various counties in eastern Jilin. He once occupied the capital of Jilin Province. Wang's troops completely disarmed the Yushu County police team on the 1st of this month and occupied Daxinlitun, causing a great shock. The garrisons and puppet police in various counties in eastern Jilin revolted. After hearing the news, the Japanese army attacked from Shulan, Shuangcheng, Lalinhe, and other places. Wang's troops reoccupied the Daba Number Tun in Yushu on the 6th of this month and fought bloody battles with the Japanese and puppet troops for several days and nights. According to the Japanese side's announcement, 60 Japanese soldiers who annihilated Wang Delin's troops were killed on the south bank of Lalin City, and more than 10 were captured. From this, it can be seen that the number of Japanese soldiers annihilated was not small. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e19">How Can the Rectification of the Western Mongolian Border Defense Be Further Delayed? By Ji <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Ever since Outer Mongolia, under the protection of Soviet Russia, declared independence, the situation in Inner Mongolia has been considered serious. After the September 18th Incident, the four northeastern provinces fell into enemy hands one after another. The three leagues and twenty-six banners in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia were also completely controlled by the Japanese military. The only remaining are the three leagues and twenty-three banners in the west. The territory is within the borders of the three provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia. Although it is still under our country's jurisdiction, the Japanese military is watching covetously and has long regarded it as something in the bag. The Tanaka Memorial originally had the conspiracy to organize the "Mongolian Great Yuan Republic," with the intention of creating a second puppet regime. To the north, it would serve as a buffer to counter the forces of Soviet Russia in Outer Mongolia; to the south, it would serve as a base for invading the central provinces of our country.</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese military personnel who have gone to various banners in Western Mongolia to contact and scout have been continuously on the road. Along the border between Rehe and Chahar, radio stations have been widely planted, roads have been built quickly, and troops and equipment have been accumulated, waiting for the time to move. Our country's border defense has been abandoned for years. The Japanese military can take advantage of it at any time and sweep through Western Mongolia. The reason why they are lingering between Guyuan and Duolun and not launching an attack is not because they have any concerns about us. It is only because Western Mongolia borders Outer Mongolia. Today, when their anti-Russian preparations have not yet been completed and their policy toward Russia has not yet been fully determined, they are unwilling to be too hasty. Therefore, after weighing the pros and cons and assessing the situation, the Japanese believe that the most appropriate strategy for Mongolia is to control the princes of Western Mongolia by means of intimidation and enticement, so that they will submit internally without a fight. In this way, it will neither cause major international resentment nor require them to assume responsibility for mobilizing troops. What plan could be better than this?</p>
<p>Although these Japanese strategies are revealed from time to time, they are difficult to conceal. Now, let's talk about those that are obvious and easy to see. For example, the military officer school was established in Wangye Temple in the Hinggan area a month or two ago, enrolling Mongolian youth and providing them with military education. It is planned to train tens of thousands of Mongolian troops in one or two years, providing them with food and equipment to become elite soldiers. Then, under the guise of revolution and independence, they will be used as pioneers for internal invasion. If a third party raises accusations and protests to them, they can claim that it is an internal dispute in Western Mongolia and has nothing to do with them. This is one aspect. A report from Rehe a few days ago stated that the fake organization demarcated the Ujimqin and Bairin banners of Inner Mongolia and placed them under the jurisdiction of the fake Hinggan Province. The princes of the two banners clashed with the Japanese and puppet troops in Linxi. The Bairin banner belongs to the Zhaomeng League in Rehe, which the Japanese have long regarded as their own. However, the Ujimqin banner belongs to the Ximeng League in Chahar Province and is not under the jurisdiction of the pseudo-Manchukuo. However, it has also been heard that it has been incorporated into the pseudo-province. Although the above news has not been confirmed, the future is long. Similar local annexation actions will eventually be difficult to guarantee that they have no intention. This is another aspect.</p>
<p>In the future, the Monglian Autonomous Government will be at the forefront of the facilities of inner mongolian autonomy, but the powers of the Military national defense are still in the hands of the central government. To this day, if our country still thinks of holding on to the overall situation in Inner Mongolia, it should rectify its troops and consolidate its border defenses so that the newly budding Inner Mongolian autonomy will not be destroyed. I sincerely hope that the central authorities and the leaders of the Monglian Autonomous Government's guiding officers will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>(Rome) Pavelić, the leader of the Croatian terrorist group who was arrested a few days ago, and his assistant Kvaternik, are strongly suspected of participating in the Marseilles tragedy. The Italian authorities believe that this case is of special importance, so they have kept silent about the results of the interrogation. What is known to the outside world is that the passports held by the two are not issued by France or Italy. French detective Royer has met with Italian police officers several times, but has still not been able to see Pavelić and Kvaternik. Mr. Royer will obtain the interrogation records in the evening and leave Turin to return home. Currently, the prison is guarded by many police officers and cavalry, preventing passage.

Britain's efforts to strengthen its influence in the Scandinavian countries are also directed at its allies and enemies, because Japan is also expanding its influence there. It is no secret that Japan has ordered munitions from Sweden. Swedish newspapers have also recorded it.

<p>German Leader Specializes in Spying on Military Intelligence</p>
<p>Supreme Court Sentences to Eight Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>(Leningrad) The Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union is hearing a case of an espionage group. The group specializes in collecting secret information about the Soviet Army, Navy, military aircraft factories, and the defenses of Leningrad and Murmansk. The leader is a German named Fuchs, and the Austrian Kortegasse, an expert hired by Murmansk's Molnarobestroitorus, is Fuchs's closest assistant. Fuchs and Kortegasse communicated in cipher and used pseudonyms. The espionage organization also hired several Soviet people to work in Leningrad and Murmansk. The main person in Leningrad was Pozhikhovsky, who was ordered by Fuchs and Kortegasse to mark the location of the garrison and the large factories related to national defense, aviation bases, airfields, fuel depots, etc., on the Leningrad map. Gatlez, a Czechoslovak, was also entrusted by Fuchs to carry out the same work, marking the locations of power plants, gas plants, water plants, etc., that Leningrad would be attacked by air during wartime. However, Gatlez not only refused to comply, but also reported the matter to the National Political Department. Kortegasse recruited three employees of the Molnarobestroi plant in Murmansk to carry out espionage work. These three were Soviet citizens, Grinfeld, Petrovsky, and Gobchikov. They collected various secret information about the port's naval and commercial transportation. All the above-mentioned personnel were arrested in early August this year. All the reconnaissance materials were seized when Fuchs, Kortegasse, and Pozhikhovsky were arrested. The Supreme Court has sentenced Fuchs to eight years imprisonment, Kortegasse to six years imprisonment, and Soviet citizen Pozhikhovsky to death for betraying his country. Grinfeld, Petrovsky, and Gobchikov were each sentenced to ten years imprisonment. (TASS, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Naval Negotiation Points of Contention <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Japan Will Demand Abolition of Aircraft Carriers</p>
<p>(London) Japan's demand to abolish aircraft carriers will be an important point of contention in the naval talks. It is reported that Representative Yamamoto has received instructions from the government to make every effort to demand the abolition of all existing aircraft carriers and prohibit their construction. Rear Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto previously served as commander of aircraft carriers, so he is very familiar with the effectiveness of this weapon. As for Japan's motive for demanding abolition, it is probably because this mobile air force base can be driven near the Japanese coast. A Japanese expert said, "We all know that aircraft carriers are useless for defense, but they are most fierce for attacking others. Fleets in the Pacific, without aircraft carriers, are not a threat to Japan." British and American officials, on the other hand, believe that Japan's countless islands are no different from aircraft carriers, because Japan will definitely be involved in wars in the Far East. The Japanese representative pointed out that this intention is a sign of deliberately invading Japan. At present, what Britain and the United States can agree to is probably only limiting the number and tonnage of aircraft carriers. Japan also advocates reducing battleships, but Britain and the United States regard battleships as the most valuable weapons. Therefore, no matter what the result, Japan's purpose is to retain a sufficient number of high-speed cruisers to control commerce in the Far East and be able to defend itself. It opposes other weapons that can attack, such as large battleships, aircraft carriers, and heavy cruisers. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) As the London Naval Talks are about to be held, the Department of the Navy today issued a descriptive statement, specifically describing the naval policy of the United States, paying special attention to the types of warships. The Department of the Navy quoted the famous saying in football strategy, namely, "A strong offense is the only method of self-defense," expressing the Department's opposition to the drastic reduction of battleship tonnage, because battleships are the most powerful weapon for naval defense, "and the United States is separated from the future war stage by 7,500 miles." The so-called future war stage refers to the Far East. The Department of the Navy does not fully believe that naval air warfare will occupy the most important position as generally imagined, saying that the effectiveness of the air force has not been proven due to climate and other factors, so it cannot be fully trusted. The so-called theory that countless aircraft will destroy cities overseas is still an ideal talk. To achieve success with this type of attack, there must be a large-scale base near the attacked area. European countries are in a different position, because dozens of countries are gathered in one place, so they need a strong air force. The United States is not. The statement also stated that the air force is not as essential to the United States as it is to European countries. However, it also stated that the United States' naval aviation is superior to any country in the world in terms of both talent and material. The difference in opinion among Britain, the United States, and Japan regarding battleship tonnage is the most important issue in the current naval talks. It is recalled that the London talks in mid-July also encountered serious difficulties due to this. Britain advocated reducing the limitation of battleship tonnage from 35,000 tons to 25,000 tons, while the United States advocated maintaining the original tonnage. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>

<p>(Brussels) The conference of the gold standard group of countries has just signed a protocol, which roughly states: "The representatives of the countries attending the meeting firmly believe that currency stability is necessary to restore the normal economic situation. Therefore, seeking the stability of the currencies of these countries is to seek the economic recovery of the world. This was stated by the representatives of the gold standard countries at the London Economic Conference in 1933. Now, in accordance with the desire to maintain the current gold parity, the following points are especially advocated: (1) A general committee shall be jointly organized by the representatives of the gold standard countries. (2) Regarding the exchange of goods between the gold standard countries, it is hoped that the actual trade volume will increase by 10 percent compared with the period from July 1, 1933, to June 30, 1934. As for the methods of increasing trade, they shall be negotiated bilaterally by the signatory countries. (3) Regarding tourism and transportation, it has been decided to organize two subcommittees to prepare reports on the proposals of the general committee or the proposals submitted to the general committee. The general committee will meet again in three months to accept this report and discuss future procedures." French Minister of Commerce Laimur, representing France, came here to participate in the conference of gold standard countries and recently declared that he was pleased with the preliminary results of the conference, saying that he was prepared to immediately conduct bilateral negotiations with Belgian Foreign Minister Jaspar to increase trade between the two countries. Negotiations with Italy will also begin soon. He also said that cooperation between the gold standard countries will not lead to a policy of restricting import quotas. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>Now Have Taken Flight to Singapore</p>
<p>Morrison Couple Thwarted in India</p>
<p>(Allahabad) In the England-Australia air race, Englishmen Scott and Black arrived here at 9:10 this morning. They stayed here for only one hour and ten minutes, and left for Singapore at 10:20, so they have now increased the distance ahead of others. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The Comet aircraft flown by English aviators Scott and Black is currently in the lead in the 12,000-mile London-Melbourne race. At 9:15 this morning, the aircraft had arrived in Allahabad. Scott told a Reuters interviewer that they had had a smooth journey since leaving Baghdad. They initially encountered head winds, but after entering India, they encountered tail winds. Except for avoiding the restricted area in the northwest province of India, they flew straight to Allahabad. Scott and others rested in Allahabad for one hour and took off again at 10:15, heading for Singapore.</p>
<p>The English aviator Morrison couple, who were originally flying the fastest, had an unfortunate encounter after leaving Baghdad. At 7:45 this morning, they were forced to land in Karachi, which is about 450 miles from Allahabad. They told a Reuters interviewer that they were afraid that the gasoline supply was insufficient to reach Allahabad directly, so they landed in Karachi. The night was foggy and they encountered head winds, but nothing else happened. At 11:15 in the morning, they took off again, but returned after only ten minutes because the machine was slightly damaged. A mechanic has been called to the Karachi airfield to carry out repairs, but they have not been completed by the afternoon. The Morrison couple decided to take off at 9:30 tonight, but were already two hours late.</p>
<p>The Dutch aircraft Douglas pilot Parmentier and Moll arrived in Baghdad at 11:11 and took off again at midnight, stopping briefly at Jask, a town on the Persian coast, and then took off again, arriving in Karachi at 8:50 in the morning. At 9:10, they proceeded to Allahabad.</p>
<p>The Dutch aircraft Pander pilot Asjes and Geyssendorfer arrived in Baghdad at 1:20 in the morning, took off again after 20 minutes, passed Karachi at 10:30, and went to Allahabad.</p>
<p>The American aviators Turner and Pangborn arrived in Baghdad at noon. They first circled in the sky for 15 minutes before descending. When landing, they came down quickly with the wind, which was different from others who came down against the wind. The fuselage was only a few inches away from the telephone pole. People in the airfield were speechless when they saw it. The ambulance attendant, expecting an accident, had already driven to rescue them. Although the American aviators finally survived unscathed, the spectators had been scared. After 40 minutes, Turner and Pangborn took off again. According to Turner, the weather in Europe was bad, and there was a lot of sand in the air when flying over Iraq, so the flight could not be fast.</p>
<p>The English aviators Jones and Waller arrived in Baghdad at 5:12 in the morning. When they departed from the Mildenhall airfield, they were carrying gasoline for 14 and a half hours of flight, and they were overdue. People in London and Baghdad were concerned about their safety, fearing that they had been forced to land in the desert. Now that they have safely arrived in Baghdad, they are relieved. It was observed that there was only one gallon of oil left in their machine. According to Waller, they flew from the Black Sea and, when passing through Persia, felt that there was very little gasoline, so they stopped the plane in a village to inspect it. They took off again this morning, causing a detour of 250 miles. This morning at 6:00, Jones and Waller took off, but returned shortly after because the machine was damaged and needed to be repaired. English Air Force officer Gillman, because the engine was damaged, dismantled the machine in Marseilles for inspection. The repairs were completed this morning and he flew to Rome at 9:10. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Singapore) A Royal Air Force bomber, which was flying to Arohesiter for the London-Melbourne air race, is now missing. The authorities have dispatched several aircraft to find it. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) According to reports from various places, the London-Melbourne air race is progressing. The English aircraft are currently in a superior position. The aircraft flown by the Morrison couple is flying the fastest, followed by the aircraft flown by the Englishmen Scott and Black. The Dutch aircraft Douglas DC-2 is in third place. Mr. Morrison's aircraft averages more than 200 miles per hour, so it flew 2,553 miles in less than 13 hours after departure and arrived safely in Baghdad at 7:10 pm. The English community and Arab welcomers were extremely numerous. The Morrison couple rested for one hour and thirty minutes before taking off again and continuing forward. Mr. Morrison and others did not stop at all on one of the most difficult sections of the race, so no obstacles are likely to occur in the entire journey thereafter. Mr. Morrison told a Reuters reporter in Baghdad that their aircraft was flying high, hoping to avoid the bad weather at low altitudes. Although it was a long journey, it was extremely smooth. When they were about to arrive in Alipo, they were very anxious because the oil in the machine was running out, but they finally arrived safely in Baghdad, with only two hours of fuel remaining.</p>
<p>The aircraft flown by Scott and Black arrived in Baghdad 12 minutes after the Morrison couple took off. As for the Dutch aviators Parmentier and Moll, who were the first to arrive in Athens, they also made good progress. They arrived in Alipo at 7:47 last night and flew to Baghdad at 8:37. The aircraft they were flying was a Douglas DC-2. Parmentier told a Reuters interviewer in Athens that they had been flying at an average of about 190 miles per hour since leaving Mildenhall and were confident that they would be able to complete the entire journey safely.</p>
<p>In addition to these three aircraft making smooth progress, the remaining aircraft have suffered many misfortunes. Miss Cochrane, the only beautiful woman in the race, was the first to withdraw because she discovered that the engine in her machine was damaged after safely arriving in the Romanian capital last night. The aircraft flown by Air Force officer Gillman had its engine dismantled and inspected after arriving in Marseilles last night due to engine damage. However, Gillman hoped to continue today. In addition, there were two other aircraft that were delayed en route due to damaged parts. Also, the aircraft flown by Air Force Second Lieutenant Shaw was forced to land on the Spanish coast 40 miles northwest of Barcelona. He was waiting for permission from the authorities to set off again this morning.</p>
<p>Four aircraft passed through the second inspection station, Rome, at night. Two aircraft arrived in Athens last night, including the aircraft flown by the Americans Turner and Pangborn. According to Mr. Turner, their aircraft encountered headwinds all the way and passed through thick fog, so they did not stay in Rome and flew over Mont Blanc. The Comet aircraft flown by the Englishmen Scott and Black took off again at 9:33 in the evening and flew to Allahabad, 2,300 miles away.</p>

<p>(London) Colonel Fitzmaurice of Ireland withdrew from the England-Australia air race due to a dispute over the carrying capacity of his aircraft. He flew from the Mildenhall airfield to Croydon this afternoon. Mr. Fitzmaurice hopes to find an American aviation inspector to inspect his aircraft. If there is an obstacle, he will fly to Dublin to obtain the necessary certificates and then depart for Melbourne to compete with the official contestants. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Batavia) The aircraft flown by Jones et al. in the England-Australia air race was forced to land on the Black Sea coast last night, surrounded by Persian villagers, and were hostile from time to time, so they had an uneasy night. They flew to this place this morning. When they were flying over the Black Sea, the weather turned bad and they used a lot of gasoline, so as soon as they reached the coast, they landed to refuel. The place they chose to land was in a field near a small Persian village. Not long after landing, they were surrounded by the local masses, who were very angry, so they stayed up all night guarding the aircraft. This morning, as soon as it dawned, they flew to this place. When they arrived here, there was only one gallon of gasoline left. Although they had this unpleasant experience last night, they still stated that they could continue flying after refueling. However, shortly after taking off, they turned back because the engine was slightly damaged. (National News Agency, 21st)</p>

<p>(Khabarovsk) Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Mr. Melnikov, wrote to Director Li Shaogeng, stating that the actions of the railway police, guards, and officials from the Japanese military in forcefully occupying railway-owned buildings have become increasingly frequent recently. The letter specifies that they are not only occupying temporary empty houses but also the residences of railway staff and the buildings of railway agencies. The original responsibility of the police officers was to maintain law and order, the guards were established to protect the railway and employees, and the Japanese officers, according to their statements, came to maintain order, but they intend to enter the residences of railway staff, break locks, and forcibly evict railway staff, reversing the roles of guest and host. Such illegal actions have obviously disrupted the operations of the railway and its employees. Mr. Melnikov listed the illegal and violent actions of the Japanese and Manchurian authorities, and requested a swift resolution to vacate the occupied houses, cease illegal actions, and protect railway employees and their property, so that they are spared the violence of these self-proclaimed authorities.

<p>Passenger Service by Zeppelin</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers are paying close attention to Dr. Hugo Eckener's negotiations with U.S. authorities in Washington to establish a Zeppelin airship line between Germany and the United States. This air route will be operated using large Zeppelin airships. According to Dr. Eckener, each trip will take just over three days and cost US$400. The safety of large Zeppelin airships has been proven reliable during its South American flights. Once regular flights are established, merchants and travelers will certainly find it convenient. Although the cost is slightly higher, it saves a lot of time, so it is extremely beneficial for those who have important matters and need to cross the Atlantic quickly and return. After reaching an agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, this matter can be implemented no later than the autumn of next year. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>

Each piece costs one yuan and is enough for one person for two days, making it easy to carry. Officials are often deceived. Recently, various foreign firms in the war zone have begun selling it.

<h3 id="e70">Osaka After the Wind and Flood Disaster (Japanese Correspondence) <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Losses No Less Than 300 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Houses and Factories Mostly Recovered</p>
<p>Osaka, Japan, is especially familiar to us Chinese. For example, Japanese shipping companies, whether it is Nippon Yusen, Yamashita Kisen, Osaka Shosen, or Nisshin Kisen, are generally called Osaka companies, as if Osaka can represent Japan, or at least symbolize Japan. Indeed, Osaka is almost a representative of Japan, because more than 80% of its industrial manufactures, especially export commodities, exported to China, Southeast Asia, and other regions, are made in Osaka. Although this is not a port open to foreign trade, there are special ships regularly traveling to Tianjin, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and even Europe. However, the navigation of foreign ships can only be restricted to Kobe, and going to Osaka is restricted. However, the distance between Osaka and Kobe is originally very close. Recently, as a result of building factories and promoting foreign trade, these two places are about to become one.</p>
<p>Osaka has been completely formed into a modern city. In terms of population, it has more than 2.5 million people, and its area is probably larger than Shanghai, so it is not as crowded as Shanghai, but the air is worse than Shanghai. In the center of the Shanghai Public Concession, from Great Horse Road to Sixth Horse Road, and the Hongkou area, except for the Bund, it is not easy to see trees. In Osaka, from Osaka Station, south to the Yamato River, north to the Shin-Yodo River, except for Nakanoshima Park, it is also not easy to see a piece of green leaf. However, in Shanghai, you are dazed by the scent of powder and meat, while in Osaka, the smoke obscures the sky, making your nostrils black.</p>
<p>The means of transportation can indeed meet her industrial needs. The tram network is well organized, and it does not take much time to travel north and south. And it only costs six sen per day (about five cents in silver dollars) to travel throughout the city, which is really beneficial to the general public, workers, and students. In addition, the city-run buses are almost as developed as the trams, and the cost is also the same, because its purpose of operation is not to make money, but to seek the convenience of transportation and promote the development of its entire industry. The industry in Japan is not characterized by large industries, but by small factories competing for success. Even in such an industrial center as Osaka, there are still many small factories. Many large factories still subcontract parts to small factories, so cheap transportation tram, bus, etc. car fares have a greater effect.</p>
<p>In the past two or three years, the rural areas of Japan have been particularly difficult. The tax burden is very heavy, and the income from sideline businesses (such as silk income) has decreased, coupled with unprecedented natural disasters, so life is difficult. Most farmers are hungry. Cities especially Osaka, a city that occupies an absolute advantage in exports, are enjoying double favors and are of course extraordinarily prosperous. One is that heavy industry and quasi-heavy industry have benefited from military industry, and have made money invisibly and visibly. The second is that the Japanese government is making every effort to promote foreign development, use the falling yen exchange rate, and subsidize foreign export trade. Light industry has also received preferential treatment, but in reality, few people actually make money. Ordinary urban residents can only barely make ends meet, and the income of workers who rely on physical labor is relatively reduced due to the depreciation of the yen. Therefore, the general consumption power has not increased, and the good market situation is ultimately false.</p>
<p>Wind and flood disasters are particularly harmful in Osaka. Most of the factories in Taisho Ward and Port Ward were either flooded or blown down by the wind. How much the loss is, the official statistics are still not accurate now. The approximate estimate is no less than 300 million yuan. Together with the losses in Hyogo Prefecture and Kobe, the industrial sector has a total of 500 million yen. The Osaka shipping terminal is still irreparable, and it will take a considerable time to organize, and it will be more troublesome to recover. But one thing that is worthy of our surprise, and should also be noted, is that from the occurrence of the wind and flood disaster on the 21st of last month to now, only three weeks have passed. The ordinary places have naturally long been restored to order, and the traces of natural disasters are completely invisible. Even the ordinary houses in the "Bihana Ward", "Port Ward", "Taisho Ward" and other places with the most severe floods have gradually been repaired, leaving only some water stains. The repair of factories is easier for some, such as machinery factories, and more difficult for others, such as lumber mills and light industries, but they are working hard to resume operations as soon as possible. The Osaka municipal authorities have also hired engineers to guide the resumption of operations in small and medium-sized factories purely on a voluntary basis, and also provide them with the necessary working capital at low interest rates, so resumption of work is more convenient, but the recovery of losses is not easy, because the one-sided development of the city, like the stimulus of military demand industry, I am afraid it is difficult to last.

<h3 id="e71">Observations on Japanese and Soviet Military Affairs by a Certain Military Expert <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet Union Can Triumph in Land, Air, and Chemical Warfare</p>
<p>Control of the Greater Khingan Range Will Determine Victory</p>
<p>(Harbin Dispatch) According to a certain military expert in Harbin familiar with the military preparations of Japan and the Soviet Union, the situation of the competition between Japan and the Soviet Union in the Far East has reached a point where the stakes are clear, and a large-scale war could break out at any time. Based on observations of the land, sea, and air forces of both sides, as well as the strategic and leadership capabilities of their military leaders, and the national finances, production capacity, and military resources, victory is likely to belong to the Soviet Union. A record of what the military expert said follows:</p>
<p>Japanese and Soviet Military Preparations (A) Land Forces: (1) Japanese Army: According to the budget for the tenth year proposed by the Japanese Ministry of the Army this August, the total amount is 680 million yuan. The peacetime strength is approximately 230,000 soldiers. The wartime strength is 25,000 soldiers per division, and the total number of mobilized personnel nationwide can increase to 5 million. (2) Soviet Army: The recent budget is unknown. According to a 1930 investigation by the International Disarmament Preparatory Commission, it was 778 million yuan. The regular army consists of 562,000 regular soldiers and 130,000 national security guards, totaling 692,000. According to a 1933 investigation, the Soviet regular army had increased to 1.3 million, and could increase to 7.5 million in wartime. (B) Naval Forces: (1) Japan: According to the Japanese Ministry of the Navy's budget for the tenth year, the total amount is 714.7 million yuan. The number of naval vessels includes 9 battleships, with a tonnage of 272,870; 4 aircraft carriers, with a tonnage of 68,870; 14 Class A cruisers, with a tonnage of 123,520; 20 Class B cruisers, with a tonnage of 93,375; 102 destroyers, with a tonnage of 121,056; 71 submarines, with a tonnage of 77,842, totaling 220 vessels, with a tonnage of 756,242. The above statistics are based on a survey conducted on February 31, 1933. (2) Soviet Union: 4 battleships, with a tonnage of 23,370; 4 cruisers, 5 ironclad ships, 23 destroyers, 6 torpedo boats, 15 submarines, 25 motorboats, 2 gunboats, 20 minesweepers, 7 river gunboats, 1 seaplane carrier, totaling 112 vessels. The above is based on 1931 statistics, many of which are old ships with very weak combat capabilities. According to recent news, the Soviet Union has deployed many warships in Vladivostok, including 15 submarines and 60 small torpedoes. Most of these torpedoes are the latest weapons invented by France, equipped with four torpedo launch tubes and four heavy machine guns, with a maximum speed of 40 to 50 knots. (C) Air Forces: (1) Japanese Air Force: According to a survey conducted four years ago, the number of Japanese aircraft was 850 for the army and 460 for the navy. According to a recent survey, the types and numbers of aircraft include 11 reconnaissance squadrons, 11 fighter squadrons, 49 bomber squadrons, and 3 training schools, totaling 26 squadrons. (2) Soviet Air Force: Since the completion of the Soviet Five-Year Plan, its ideal of an invincible air force has been realized. According to "The Threat of the Red Russian Air Force" by Takashi Noguchi, the Soviet Air Force has 20 air brigades in the army, each brigade consisting of an air bomber team of 50 bombers and an air fighter team of 60 fighters, with a total of 2,200 aircraft. There are 48 large detachments and 60 independent squadrons deployed throughout the country. Each squadron has 2 platoons, each platoon consisting of 3 aircraft. Independent squadrons consist of 8 aircraft. In addition, there are 10 balloon teams and 3 airships. In the navy, there are 2 bomber detachments, 6 independent bomber squadrons, fighter squadrons, reconnaissance squadrons, and the Far Eastern Fleet's seaplane aviation team, totaling 220 teams. The distribution is as follows: 78 reconnaissance squadrons, 68 fighter squadrons, 49 bomber squadrons, 6 training squadrons, and 24 naval aircraft teams, currently deployed in the Far East (east of the Urals), under the jurisdiction of the Novosibirsk Military Region, including one bomber squadron in Amursk, one bomber detachment in Irkutsk, one seaplane aviation team in Boli, one reconnaissance squadron in Chita, two bomber squadrons in Novosibirsk, one reconnaissance squadron in Spassk, and one reconnaissance squadron in Vladivostok. According to the above descriptions of the sea, land, and air forces of Japan and the Soviet Union, the Soviet navy is clearly inferior to Japan. However, in terms of land forces, Japan is far inferior to the Soviet Union. In addition, Japan is also unlikely to have an advantage in mechanical equipment suitable for both peacetime and wartime. A comparison is as follows: armored trains: Soviet Union 38 teams plus one brigade, Japan unknown; armored vehicles: Soviet Union 15 teams, Japan unknown; tank teams: Soviet Union 3 regiments, Japan 1 squadron; telegraph teams: Soviet Union 12 regiments, Japan 2 regiments.</p>
<p>Strategic Observations Furthermore, strategically speaking, Japan also has many disadvantages. According to the military expert, if Japan goes to war with the Soviet Union, there are three strategic threats it would face: (1) the Soviet Union's concentrated attack strategy; (2) the plain warfare in Hulunbuir; and (3) the Soviet Union's chemical warfare. The concentrated attack strategy is advocated by General Galen, commander of the Far Eastern Military District, and many other military leaders, such as Air Force Staff Officer Chad. This strategy is implemented when the fighting between the two armies is most intense. In a combat emergency, artillery engages in fierce artillery battles with the enemy in fixed positions, while fighter planes provide cover for the battlefield, attack aircraft raid the enemy's mobile units, bombers attack the enemy's air force bases, and several tanks charge into the enemy's positions. Then, the air force advances with a large group of hundreds of aircraft at full strength, annihilating the enemy in one fell swoop. This is the so-called concentrated attack strategy. The plain warfare in the Hulunbuir region is good for using the above strategy to subdue Japan. What Japan fears most about plain warfare is not the large number of Soviet troops, but the threat of the Soviet air force. Therefore, Japanese military experts advocate that if Japan is not confident in plain warfare, it should retreat to the Greater Khingan Range and use small forces to advance and retreat in the Hulunbuir area to contain the Soviet army's advance. The Soviet Union's chemical warfare is also something that puts the Japanese military in a difficult position. It is said that each Soviet division has a gas officer, and all divisions and flight units have a chemical warfare platoon. There are also special military training teams for gas officers and military chemists. Gas masks have been distributed to all soldiers and horses. In terms of industrial mobilization, military resources, and national finances, Japan is also unlikely to have an advantage. The Soviet Union is a socialist country, and all domestic industries are state-owned, so it can be said that the entire country is mobilized. The success of the Five-Year Plan has made finances no longer a problem. The completion of the Siberian double-track railway has removed obstacles to military resources. On the other hand, Japan is facing a deficit in finances due to the expansion of its navy, army, and air force, coupled with domestic economic panic, which makes its finances even more difficult. In other aspects, such as the leadership of military leaders and the guidance of affiliated allies, the two countries are evenly matched. Japan can use the puppet state, while the Soviet Union can contact the United States and China. Although Japanese military leaders are strong, the Soviet army's party members are also quite strong. It is said that in 1928, they accounted for 22.6%, and by 1933, they had increased to 59.4%. Although Japan is inferior to the Soviet Union in many ways, it also has advantages over the Soviet Union. First, Japan has completed the railway network in Northeast China. Second, Japan's military resources do not need to be obtained from afar, but can be directly obtained from Northeast China or North China. Third, the powerful Japanese navy can threaten the Soviet fortress of Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Final Victory According to the above, the two armies each have their strengths and weaknesses. So, to whom will victory belong, and where will the outcome be determined? According to "The Red Army's Far Eastern Operations" by Japanese military expert Susumu Hirata, "The struggle between Japan and Russia will take place mainly in the Greater Khingan Range. This is recognized by military experts in both countries." Therefore, the mission of the troops stationed in Chita is to seize the Greater Khingan Range with lightning speed. If the Soviet army occupies this mountain range and builds solid fortifications to attack the Eastern Provinces, the Japanese army will be in a difficult situation because the Japanese army must attack uphill against the Soviet army and suffer great sacrifices. Moreover, the Greater Khingan Range is full of pines and cypresses, which are lush and towering, so all kinds of positional warfare and mountain warfare are ready. The difficulties and hardships can be imagined. Conversely, if the Japanese army occupies the area first, the Soviet army will also suffer the same pain. Therefore, if the Japanese army based in Qiqihar and the Soviet army based in Manzhouli launch an attack at the same time, one reaching the east side of the mountain range and the other reaching the west side of the mountain range, the two armies will inevitably engage in a fierce battle for the mountain. Whoever can seize the summit can win the final victory of the war. However, the Soviet Union also has chemical warfare, which Japan is no match for. The poisonous gas used by the Soviet army is an orange mist that can remain for a week. Soldiers must wear protective clothing at all times, and the vegetation in the poisoned area will wither. Its intensity can be imagined. On the other hand, the Soviet Union has a strong air force and a strong land force, as well as concentrated attack and Hulunbuir plain warfare, which are enough to put the Japanese army in a difficult situation. Therefore, as a result, if a war breaks out between Japan and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has the possibility of achieving the final victory. However, it must be stated that this is a judgment based on the current material foundation of Japan and the Soviet Union. As for the participation of other countries or other events, it is difficult to predict who will ultimately win.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Japanese and Puppet Troops Suddenly Arrived Outside Gubeikou <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Demanding to Enter the War Zone to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Sternly Rejected by Huo Shi</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, On the morning of the 17th of this month, more than 600 Japanese and puppet troops, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery, suddenly arrived outside Gubeikou. Among them was a Japanese captain as the company commander. He met with Huo Shi, the director of the Gubeikou Office of the Jizhou-Miyun Administrative Commissioner's Office, requesting permission for the Japanese and puppet troops to pass through Gubeikou and Caojialu in order to go to the war zone bordering Jixian, Yutian, and Zunhua to suppress bandits. The captain also said that bandits had recently sprung up in the war zone, and Japanese and Korean residents felt insecure. The Chinese security forces were unable to pacify the area, so they came to assist in the suppression. Huo Shi immediately refused, telling him that although bandits had been found in the war zone, they were all small groups, and the Hebei Provincial Security Forces were strong enough to suppress them. There was no need for foreign troops to enter to assist in the suppression, so as to avoid causing panic among merchants and residents and causing misunderstandings. The Japanese captain insisted on entering, and the troops remained outside Gubeikou. Huo Shi telegraphed Yin Rugeng for instructions. Yin, who had been inspecting Malanyu, was on his way back, passing through Yutian, and accompanied by Japanese military attache Shibayama, to investigate the Miyakoshi incident. He had not yet received a report on this matter.</p>
<p>Miyakoshi Incident: After Yin Rugeng and Shibayama investigated this time, Yin will report to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and another negotiation will resolve the matter. Yutian County Chief Chen Baosheng was deemed by the authorities to have failed to adequately protect foreigners in advance and failed to work hard afterward. Therefore, he has been replaced, and Huang Zhongkai has been appointed to fill the vacancy. He went to take over on the 16th of this month. Huang is a graduate of Meiji University in Tokyo, Japan, and has served as a secretary in the Pingjin military and political councils. In the future, diplomatic relations with Japan may be more effective. As for the bandits in the war zone, Zunhua, Yutian, Jixian, Fengrun, Huairou, and Miyun are still the most numerous. Large groups are stationed near the Great Wall line, confronting the local militias in the interior, while small groups are scattered everywhere, seizing opportunities to loot when the militia's suppression efforts are insufficient. On the 15th of this month, more than 100 bandits rushed in from the Yanshan Pass area, looting villages along the way and seizing a lot of weapons. No small number of hooligans were willing to join the bandits. Therefore, in just one day, the number of bandits had expanded to 170 or 180, and many men and women were kidnapped as hostages. The Zunhua militia and the war zone security forces were informed and jointly suppressed the bandits. A fierce battle broke out near Malanyu for two hours. The bandits were overwhelmed and abandoned several hostages. The rest of the bandits fled toward the pseudo-Jehol border. The puppet troops stationed in Malanyu Qingling, fearing that the bandits would return to the interior of Jehol, sent two companies of soldiers to intercept them. The bandits desperately resisted. After two hours of fighting, the puppet troops killed more than a dozen people, and the interception was slightly loosened. The bandits fled toward Zhongyingzi. In the northern mountains of Xinglong County, near the Dashui and Xiaodaoshui mining areas, there is also a group of bandits, numbering around 300, with guns and machine guns. They are hiding and have not come out, probably planning to take the opportunity to harass northern Zunhua. Therefore, the militias are heavily armed. (18th)</p>

<p>丨Surrounded and Expected to Be Annihilated丨</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, The pseudo-Seventh Army Corps of bandit Luo Binghui has been defeated everywhere from Fujian to Zhejiang to Anhui, and its elite troops have been almost wiped out. When the bandits recently fled to the Liukou area of Qimen, the Jiangxi border troops rushed to encircle and suppress them, and achieved considerable gains. Luo Binghui, in desperation, led the remaining 2,000 to 3,000 people to the area bordering Fuliang, Qimen, and Qiupu. Chen Tiaoyuan also ordered Li Zongjian's troops to suppress them. On the 13th of this month, a fierce battle broke out with the pseudo-Ninth Army Corps near Yaqiao in northern Fuliang, near the Anhui border. According to a telegram from Li's brigade to the headquarters on the 15th, in this battle, more than 200 people, including Peng Hanwei, commander of the Third Division of the pseudo-Seventh Army Corps, and Shi Qinan, commander of the pseudo-regiment, were killed, more than 40 bandits were captured, and 60 rifles, several light and heavy machine guns, and 3 telescopes were seized. Luo Binghui has now been surrounded by the Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui armies, and is expected to be annihilated.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Taiwan's Population Soars <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>An Increase of 122,843 People Last Year</p>
<p>Four Times the Birth Rate of Japan</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, Taiwan, a small island located on the boundary between the tropical and temperate zones of the Pacific Ocean, has a mild climate and comfortable living conditions, resulting in a continuous increase in population fertility. The soaring birth rate in Taiwan is considered the highest in the world. The population dynamics statistics for Taiwan in 1933, published by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office at the end of September, are sufficient to reveal the true picture of Taiwan's population boom (the following statistics exclude the indigenous Taiwanese tribes, because the so-called Taiwanese today are descendants of people from southern Fujian who migrated to Taiwan and constitute the basic population of Taiwan).</p>
<p>The total population surveyed in 1933 was 4,974,157. The statistics are divided into six categories: marriage, divorce, birth, stillbirth, mortality, and increase.</p>
<p>(1) Marriage: The total number of marriages was 44,078, an average of 121 per day. The ratio per thousand people is about 9 (8.9). Compared with the previous year (1932), there was an actual increase of 955 cases, but the ratio per thousand people was approximately the same. By race, Taiwanese accounted for 43,001 cases, Japanese 900 cases, and foreigners 176 cases (mostly Chinese overseas). There was only one Korean case. Also, by race, the ratio per thousand people was 9.2 for Taiwanese, 4 for foreigners, 3.5 for Japanese, and 0.8 for Koreans (Note: the total number of marriages in Japan in 1933 was 515,270, with a ratio of 7.8 per thousand people).</p>
<p>(2) Divorce: The total number of divorces was 3,949, an average of 11 per day, a decrease of 36 compared to the previous year. The divorce rate per hundred marriages in 1933 was 9, and in 1932 it was 9.2, a decrease compared to the previous year. The ratio per population was 0.8 in both years. Analysing the number of divorces by race, apart from 11 Japanese cases and 4 foreign cases, the remaining 3,934 cases were all Taiwanese. Also, by race, the divorce rate per thousand people was 0.8 for Taiwanese, and very low for Japanese and others (Note: the total number of divorces in Japan in 1933 was 51,437, with a ratio of 0.8 per thousand people, and a marriage-divorce ratio of 10).</p>
<p>(3) Birth: The total number of births was 221,350, an average of 606 per day, 25 per hour, or one birth every two minutes and twenty-four seconds. This is far from the Japanese statistic of four births per minute (one birth every 15 seconds) in 1933. However, in terms of the ratio per thousand people, Taiwan has 44.5, while Japan has 31.6. Therefore, the birth rate in Taiwan is much higher than in Japan. Analysing the total number of births by race, Taiwanese accounted for 211,737, Japanese 7,979, foreigners 1,613, and Koreans 21. By the ratio per thousand people, Taiwanese accounted for 45.4, foreigners 36.8, Japanese 31.1, and Koreans 17.6. The total number of births actually increased by 7,158 compared to the previous year, and there was an increase of 0.3 per thousand people compared to the previous year (Note: the total number of births in Japan in the same year was 2,121,125).</p>
<p>(4) Stillbirth: The total number of stillbirths (i.e., miscarriages) was 7,885, an average of 22 stillbirths per day, with a ratio of about 1.5 per thousand people, an actual increase compared to the previous year. By race, Taiwanese accounted for 7,417, with a ratio of 1.6, Japanese 389, with a ratio of 1.5, foreigners 77, with a ratio of 1.8, and Koreans 2, with a ratio of 1.7 (Note: the total number of stillbirths in Japan in the same year was 119,579, with a ratio of 1.8).</p>
<p>(5) Mortality: The total number of deaths was 98,507, an average of 270 per day, or one death every five minutes and twenty-seven seconds. This is dozens of times different from the Japanese statistic of 2.3 deaths per minute in the same year. Analysing the number of deaths by race, Taiwanese accounted for 94,975, Japanese 2,747, foreigners 774, and Koreans only 11. By the ratio per thousand people, 20.3 Taiwanese died per thousand people, 17.7 foreigners, 10.7 Japanese, and 9.2 Koreans. Comparing the mortality rate per thousand people in Taiwan and Japan, Taiwan was 19.8 and Japan was 17.8. Comparing the mortality rate per thousand people in Taiwan in 1933 and 1932, there was a decrease of 0.7 (Note: the total number of deaths in Japan in 1933 was 1,193,916). (6) State of Increase: Overall, the population of Taiwan increased by 122,843 in the past year, with births subtracting deaths, an average increase of 337 per day, and an increase of about 24.7 per thousand people. Compared with 1932, there was an increase of one per thousand people. By race, Taiwanese increased by 25 per thousand people, which is the most alarming number, followed by Japanese with an increase of 20.4, then foreigners (mostly Chinese overseas) with an increase of 19.2, and Koreans also had an increase of 8.4. Comparing the natural increase rate of 13.8 per thousand people in Japan in the same year with 24.7 in Taiwan, the population increase rate in Taiwan is almost double that of Japan.</p>

<p>According to the Chamber of Commerce's investigation, the annual import and export volume of Gansu Province is as follows: The exports are: (1) Gaolan, Yuzhong, Lintao, Jingyuan, and other counties produce 35,000 dan of self-made cotton water tobacco, with a value of 100 yuan per dan, totaling 3.5 million yuan. It is sold in Tianjin, Shanghai, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and other places.

It is sold in Pingjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other ports. (4) Wool: It is not organized into bales, so it is difficult to determine the exact amount. However, about 4 million jin of Qinghai wool passes through Gansu and is transported to Tianjin and Suiyuan, with a value of 20 yuan per 100 jin, totaling 800,000 yuan. The total value of the above-mentioned exports from Gansu Province each year is 7,316,000 yuan, plus the wool passing through Qinghai, the total value is 8,116,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The imports are: (1) About 6,000 bolts of wool and linen fabrics are transported from Tianjin and Shanghai, of which 4,000 bolts are wool fabrics and 2,000 bolts are linen fabrics. Wool fabrics are worth 140 yuan per bolt, and linen fabrics are worth 12 yuan per bolt, totaling 560,000 yuan. (2) About 500 bolts of silk and satin are transported from Suzhou, Hangzhou, Sichuan, and other places, of which 200 bolts are silk and 300 bolts are satin. Silk is worth 30 yuan per bolt, and satin is worth 50 yuan per bolt, totaling 21,000 yuan.

<p>Forests: Gansu Province has a vast territory and sparse population, with mountains and valleys crisscrossing. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were many forests in various places. Since the Republic of China, there has been a lack of advocacy, and protection has been inadequate. As a result, most of the natural forests have been chopped down by the local people, resulting in the so-called "poor mountains and hungry waters." In recent years, although the construction of [illegible text] has shocked the national afforestation movement, attention has gradually been paid to it, and planting has been advocated repeatedly. However, due to the difficulty of funding in the past and the changes in the political situation, the so-called afforestation movement has become a mere formality. If the counties are not strictly ordered to protect the existing forests and actively increase the planting of new forests in a down-to-earth manner in the future, the future crisis will not only be a lack of timber, but also the already dry climate will be even more intense.</p>
<p>Mineral Products: The reserves are abundant, and they have been thoroughly investigated and intermittently mined by people. (1) Gold mines: The producing areas are Dunhuang, Jiuquan, Anxi, Yongdeng, Gaolan, Pingliang, Tianshui, Qingshui, Zhuanglang, Dongle, Jingyuan, Lintao, Xigu, Cheng County, etc. (2) Silver mines: The producing areas are Shandan, Yongdeng, Ningding, Lintao, Gaolan, Wen County, Cheng County, Liangdang, etc. (3) Mercury: The producing areas are Wen County, Wudu, etc. (4) Oil: The producing areas are Yumen, Jiuquan, Dunhuang, etc. (5) Coal mines: Distributed everywhere, almost throughout the province. Residents dig only a few zhang into the ground to find coal, but they are dug and abandoned, which is a pity. (6) Salt mines: Produced in Dunhuang, Gaotai, Minqin, Hongshui, Yongdeng, Jingyuan, Xihe, and other counties. (7) Copper mines: Produced in Gaolan, Taosha, Lintan, Hongshui, Yumen, and other counties. (8) Iron mines: Produced in Yongdeng, Gulang, Huining, Cheng County, Liangdang, Min County, Lintan, and other counties. (9) Lead mines: Produced in Yongdeng, Wuwei, Jingyuan, Min County, Cheng County, etc. (10) Asbestos: Produced in Wuwei, Yongchang, Huating, Tianshui, and other counties. In addition, Gaolan, Yongdeng, and other counties also produce manganese ore, and Gaotai, Yongdeng, Gaolan, Huating, and other counties also produce pottery clay. In short, Gansu Province has these treasures, especially gold and silver mines, which are like cash in hand. In the midst of the high calls for developing the Northwest, we must not allow the treasures to be abandoned on the ground for a long time.</p>
<p>Lanzhou is located south of Gaolan and controls the Yellow River to the north. From a distance, it is surrounded by mountains and water, with a tight and strict image. From a closer look, the high passes and rapids have a magnificent momentum. The climate is mild, and there are many beautiful forests and springs. Yesterday, thanks to my friends Guo Shifen and Du Yutian, I toured the Five Springs Mountain, Xiaoxihu, Beita, Jinshan Temple, Zhuangyan Temple, etc. The pavilions and clouds, the pines and cypresses are intertwined, and everywhere it shows that Lanzhou City is not only an important town in the western border, but also a famous scenic spot in the northwest. However, in the fifth month of the lunar calendar, during the so-called "City God's Birthday," various charity organizations compete to chant scriptures and offer dramas, lasting for more than ten days. The thousand candles in the main hall are constantly burning, and the Kangxi Sacred Edict of the former Qing Dynasty is still recited, which is too superstitious. "The city loves high buns, four feet high," the city is so supportive of the city's prosperity, and the countryside is even more afraid of little ghosts.</p>
<p>Overlooking the Yellow River from the north city, I often see fishermen catching fish along the shore, first catching them with small nets and then raising them in large nets in the river. Some so-called philanthropists go to buy them. Ordinary nets contain more than a hundred fish, and the price is always more than 20 yuan. The business seen on that day was that two nets were priced at 56 yuan in total. It is said that there are more small fish than large fish, which means that more lives are waiting to be saved. The philanthropist muttered scriptures, untied the net with his own hands, and released the fish into the river, called "releasing life." However, the fishermen downstream were already waiting to catch them. Looking back at the surrounding crowd, most of them were poor farmers who had fled from the countryside, without food and clothing. The danger to their lives is no different from the fish in the net. I remember that if philanthropists could transfer the money they used to release fish to run a factory for the poor or to subsidize the rural areas, then in terms of Buddhism, "saving a life is like building a seven-story pagoda," which would not only benefit the society alone. It is also heard that the local people of Lanzhou are not good at eating fish, and most of those who eat fish are foreigners. Therefore, although Lanzhou is adjacent to the Yellow River, a natural fish pond, it is impossible to find a fish market in the city.</p>
<p>The financial institutions in Lanzhou currently include (1) the Lanzhou branch of the Central Bank, which only operates domestic remittances; (2) the Gansu Ping City Official Money Bureau, which operates deposits and withdrawals and remittances. The Department of Finance plans to expand it and change it to the Gansu Farmers Bank; (3) Money houses and silver houses, which have a wider range of businesses than banks, followed by auxiliary financial institutions that are inadequate, and the pawnshop industry, which has a direct relationship with ordinary people. Large pawnshops charge a monthly interest of 3%, with a redemption period of three years, which is unsustainable and has gone bankrupt. Small pawnshops have no fixed interest rate, and the longest term is three months, which has been banned. Medium pawnshops charge a monthly interest of 5%, with a redemption period of one year. It is heard that the Department of Finance is planning to find a way to reduce interest rates and extend the period for the pawnshop industry. The ordinary loan interest rate is about 2-3%. Currency: (1) Current silver dollars, that is, Yuan Datou and Sun Yat-sen silver coins, copper auxiliary coins are ten or twenty copper coins. (2) Paper money: various banknotes of the Central Bank, four types of copper coin notes issued by the Official Money Bureau: ten, twenty, fifty, and one hundred, are all in common use. Ordinary silver coins of one yuan can be exchanged for 600 copper coins, that is, 6,000 wen. If you exchange for copper coin notes, you can only get 4,000 wen, that is, the price of copper coin notes on the market is one-third higher than the price of copper coins. Paper money from other counties is rarely circulated.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Dangerous Engineering Occurs in the Lower Reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Wang Wangzhuang and Dama Jia are being rescued</p>
<p>The water level in Shaanxi Prefecture has dropped, but it is still rising in Shandong</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, the water level of the Yellow River this year is very high. Although the Changyuan River Dam in southern Hebei has collapsed, no danger has occurred in this province so far. The River Affairs Bureau has issued an order to the entire river on the 18th to withdraw the defenses, and all defending and defending committee members and inspectors have been transferred back to Jinan. In another four or five days, the Frost's Descent period will arrive, and Anlan can be reported. Unexpectedly, due to the poor discharge of the tail, the water level of the entire river has receded slowly, the flood period is long, and the scouring is too severe. Today, dangerous works suddenly occurred in Dama Jia in the territory of Lijin County on the north bank of the lower reaches and Wang Wangzhuang in the territory of Patai County. Officials, soldiers, and civilians are currently rushing to protect them. According to the telegram from Duan Chang Zhou Yumei, many stone protections along Wang Wangzhuang have been washed away, and the first rake is dormant. After receiving the report, the River Affairs Bureau believed that the material affairs of the section were complete, and it was easy to rush to the rescue, but the newly purchased straw materials had not yet been inspected and accepted. It specifically telegraphed back to Zhou Yumei to pay attention to supervising the work and rushing to protect, and to allow the use of straw materials when necessary. There are also dangerous works between the ladder dam of Zhao Jia Ba in the lower reaches, and the straw materials in the lower section of Tang Jia Sao Jia Sao Dam are rotten. Due to the large water flow and the fierce flow, the situation is unstable, and it will need to be replaced in the future. In addition, each section in this province reported rising water levels today, and the water level at Luokou was 30 meters, 2 inches, and 4 inches, which is an unprecedented phenomenon. Yesterday, the water level in Shaanxi Prefecture, Henan was 293 meters and 5 inches, and the flow rate was 5,250 cubic meters. This morning, the water level was 292 meters and 9 inches 7, which was 5 inches 3 lower than the scissors. Today, the flow rate has also been reduced to 3,250 cubic meters. However, a telegram came this afternoon that the water level had receded to 292 meters and 5 inches 8, and the flow rate had also been reduced to 2,950 cubic meters. According to the usual practice, although the water level is low in autumn, the strength is submerged, and accidents occur every time, so it is not optimistic. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, went to Luokou in the north of Jinan City today to inspect and re-defend the river.</p>
<p>The Yellow River Conservancy Commission is currently conducting a detailed survey of the entire river and planning for overall remediation. The first survey team has already departed. Engineer Mu Zhifang is the leader of the team and is surveying between Lanfeng and Kaocheng. Because there is a section of the dam where the junction of Hebei and Henan is not connected, although there are people, the embankment is also very low and thin, which is very worrying. Therefore, great attention is paid to this place. The second survey team is preparing to go to the Guan area to survey. Qi Shouan, who once served as a defense committee member in Shandong, is the team leader. The purpose of the third survey team is to survey the tail. After the Yellow River Conservancy Commission closes the meeting in Tianjin, it will begin to organize. It is proposed that Hua Guanshi serve as the team leader. Hua is also a member of the Shandong branch of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and is currently in Jinan. He will return to Henan after the Frost's Descent, and then lead the survey team back to Shandong. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Farmers' Riot in Suzhou <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Thirty houses of tax collectors burned down</p>
<p>Local people telegraphed the province to send personnel to investigate</p>
<p>The issue of wasteland survey by farmers in the areas outside Loumen, Waikuatang, and Xietang in Suzhou, due to the malpractice of false reports by tax collectors, gathered more than a thousand people to carry out a riot and set fire to the houses of tax collectors. The situation has been briefly described in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the storm was launched on the night of the 19th. More than 500 farmers outside Loumen gathered, each holding a torch, and first rushed to the house of tax collector Xing Honggao, set it on fire, and completely burned down more than ten houses in less than half an hour. Nine houses in Xing's brother Shuigen's house were also affected. Fortunately, the family escaped beforehand and was not burned to death. The farmers went to various villages to beat gongs, and in a short time, seven or eight hundred people gathered, rushed to the house of Zhu Fuchang, the deputy head of Ningnan Town and tax collector of the eighth ward of the twenty-fourth district, and burned down eight houses, with a loss of about 5,000 yuan. At twelve o'clock in the middle of the night, they rushed to Xiyi Village and demolished the houses of Wei Xiangzhou, the deputy head of Fengjing Township, and Qu Fuyuan and Qu Hengshan, the tax collectors of the twenty-eighth ward of Waikuatang, completely. At that time, the farmers were gathering more and more, and the gongs were ringing in the villages, and the fire was shining in the sky. They also went to the houses of Mao Jinan and Gao Liugen in the first ward and set fire to the houses. The crowd planned to go to the homes of tax collectors in the Guanxiduli area to set fire, but fortunately, the police district in charge sent police to block them at the Yong'an Bridge. The crowd dared not rush over and went east. Zhang Xun, an official, captured two people named Li Shouquan and Gu Lanting who were beating gongs and took them to the interrogation office. According to Li and Gu, they were both bailiffs who were forced out by the crowd to beat gongs. The two were sent to the Public Security Bureau for verification and handling. At about 2:00 a.m. on the 20th, it spread from Waikuatang to Xietang Township. Hundreds of farmers in the township also gathered and rushed to Zhu Yongxiang's house in Nanxiaozhuang to set fire, and then to the Yachengli of Qiongcheng Township to set fire continuously, burning down the houses of Shen Jinguan, Shen Heqing, and Shen Ziqing, about 20 houses were destroyed. At about 6:00 a.m., they went to Chenqidun Village in Liangcheng Township and burned down four houses of Liang Fugao, the head of the township, and five houses of the Lianghong Township. They also went to Duntou Village and demolished more than 40 houses of Yang Yisong, Yang Pinsong, and Yao Yiren. They also went to Xia Yisheng's house in Fenghui Village to set fire. In the afternoon of the same day, more than 500 farmers in Yinjia Bang Township, Huangshiqiao outside Fengmen, also set fire to the houses of tax collectors, and similar incidents also occurred in Shitan Village. On the night of the 20th, there was still firelight in the southeast of Loumen, and the authorities were investigating. After receiving a long-distance telephone report from the Xietang and other towns on the 20th, Wu, the county magistrate, immediately sent Section Chief Xu and Captain Nie to lead 20 security team soldiers to the countryside to suppress the situation and investigate the arson. After arriving in the countryside, Section Chief Xu immediately convened the villagers at Huimin Bridge and gave earnest exhortations. The villagers were quite moved and dispersed immediately. Section Chief Xu returned to the city that afternoon. The Disaster Relief Association and the various landowners first sent representatives Qian Zichu, Shen Yizhi, Shen Shie, etc. to the county government to visit County Magistrate Wu, requesting that it be effectively stopped to avoid spreading. County Magistrate Wu agreed to strictly prevent and control. County Magistrate Wu immediately ordered the water and land police teams to strictly prevent and control in the four townships to curb the unrest, and sent two security teams, led by Nie Dezhao and Zhang Dichen, to Xietang at 8:00 p.m. to stop the storm. Local people Zhang Yiju, etc., telegraphed the Civil and Financial Departments yesterday (21st), requesting that high-ranking officials be sent to Suzhou to investigate thoroughly. Wu Erchang, the head of the first district, believed that the villagers in the area outside Fengmen would also express their opinions, so yesterday (21st) he convened the heads, deputy diagram directors, town dings, etc. of Fengxi, Jingting, and other townships to hold a meeting to discuss prevention and control measures, and ordered the heads of each township to persuade the villagers not to blindly follow. In this storm, a total of more than 30 houses were burned, with a loss of about 20,000 yuan, but it is difficult to predict whether it can be quelled.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Songjiang: Poor Farmers of Cao Shitu Robbed <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Punan Caojing is a coastal area, far from the Huangpu River. There was a severe drought in the summer, and most of the rice and cotton there were barren. Farmers worked hard all year round and it was difficult to get enough food and clothing. Therefore, the stubborn people all plotted illegitimate thoughts. The night before last, the farmer Wang Jiangshi's house in Cao Shitu suddenly came with seven or eight bandits speaking local accents, holding kitchen knives as weapons. They broke into the house through the front door and tied up Wang Jiangshi and her two young children. They searched the house but found nothing to rob. Before leaving, they robbed four bales of cotton and one cotton quilt and fled.</p>

<p>There is a Changtai Temple in Kaihua Township outside Nanmen, presided over by Monk Yuanxiu. Yuanxiu is young and frivolous, and specializes in widely accepting male and female converts outside the temple, spreading rumors to confuse the public, and making profits from it. Recently, two vegetarians, Zhu Mingfeng and Wang Zengbao, also entered the temple in the name of cultivation. Unexpectedly, they had an affair with a cooking woman in the temple who was about forty years old. The matter was known to the blind monk named Ben'an in the temple, who questioned them, but was beaten severely by Zhu and Wang. Ben'an did not dare to resist at the time, so he had to endure the silence and complained to the presiding monk Yuanxiu after he returned to the temple. Unexpectedly, after Yuanxiu heard the words, he turned around and gave Ben'an a severe beating. Ben'an was so angry with this strange grievance that he suddenly had the idea of ​​being tired of the world, so he sneaked into the room the day before and hanged himself to death with a hemp rope. It is also said to be tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Salt Transport Department Bans Salt Licenses <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The salt eaten in Jiangnan is Zhejiang salt. In the second year of the Republic of China, the county council of this county resolved to request the provincial council to transfer the advisory to the authorities to change to Huai salt. After the provincial council passed the three requests, it was in progress, but the Guizhou coup occurred and the matter was suspended. At that time, the voices of changing to Huai salt in the county were loud and clear. Yang, a native of the county, took the opportunity to obtain ten salt licenses from the salt guild and rented them to others for business, collecting a top fee of 300 yuan per license and a monthly rent of 5 yuan per license. Until the end of last month, an order was received to register sauce gardens and salt shops. The families with salt licenses must take photos of the salt licenses and send them to the Songjiang Salt Transport Department for verification. The Salt Transport Department verified that the ten salt licenses obtained by Yang had no transport imprint, and ordered a ban on business. After receiving the order, the Salt Guild is now working on canceling the ten salt licenses issued before in order to maintain merit.</p>

<p>Dai Rongbing, a merchant and resident of Zou Xu Town, Wu County, was twenty years old. In the summer of this year, he owed a large sum of money for soybean cakes on behalf of farmers. Recently, the future was urgent to pay back. Dai repeatedly asked the farmers to pay back, but because of the drought, he could not pay for a while. Dai had no choice but to go home to discuss with his father and take the money to pay back, but he was severely reprimanded and refused to pay. Dai was extremely depressed because of this, so he went to the city early in the morning of the 20th, wrote three suicide notes and held them in his hand, and walked to the railway beside the north of the city. At about 11 o'clock, the Beijing-Shanghai express train sped past. Dai immediately jumped onto the track and lay down. In an instant, he was crushed into two pieces by the wheels, his body and head separated, and blood and flesh splattered everywhere. It was terrible to see.

In the afternoon, the county prosecutor reported the case and went to examine it once. For a time, the viewers were crowded and it was passed on as a strange event.</p>

<p>To President Zhou of the Zhenjiang Department of Education, Zhu Zhaosheng, Director of the Songjiang County Education Bureau, is honest, capable, and efficient. Since taking office, he has planned carefully and strived to ensure the safety and development of local education. He has spared no effort in sorting out education funds and properties. It is heard that the director has recently angered the county government for reporting the incident of Zhe Tiansheng's corruption and encroachment of education fees, and has been subjected to restraint, making it impossible to cook without rice, forcing him to resign. If he is allowed to rise high and achieve what he has planned, then it is feared that those who come will not only be able to follow the wishes of the county government. The future of Songyi education will be unbearable to hear, and the arrogance of corrupt officials and the reversal of right and wrong will have a greater impact on the customs and people's hearts. Make the clear and bright Soviet government be tarnished. Some people are concerned about their hometown and cannot remain silent. They specially telegraphed to President Jun, Xunci to retain him, and on the one hand, regarding the case of Zhe Tiansheng's corruption and encroachment on education fees in Songjiang County, they strongly request that Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government thoroughly investigate and punish corruption and comfort the people.

<p>Miao Qiujie, the Lianghuai Salt Transport Commissioner, previously advocated for the northward transportation of Huai salt and used armed force to suppress petitioning representatives, which led to a city-wide strike in Yangzhou. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance, due to the commissioner's use of firearms to threaten industry, commerce, and education, which caused a complete standstill, received urgent telegrams from all sides, recognizing the gravity of the situation. Chen Guoliang, an inspector dispatched immediately, arrived in Yangzhou on the evening of the 19th, traveling day and night, and changed his surname to conduct a thorough investigation. He also tried to purchase and read newspapers from the previous few days. On the morning of the 20th, he went to the local tax office and spoke with Jin Yunfu, the deputy director of transportation, for a long time. He then telegraphed the county Chamber of Commerce, inviting representatives from all sectors to meet with him. Representatives from various sectors, including Hu Zhen, Han Guohua, Zhu Ganchen, Teng Yizhai, Zhang Jichuan, Zhu Lisun, and Bao Xiangzhong, went to meet with Chen at the Transport Commissioner's Office. The representatives first thoroughly explained the history of Huai salt, reported the course of the strikes and school boycotts, and emphasized the importance of the Twelve Wharf sailing transport issue. Chen nodded in agreement and responded that the Minister attached great importance to this matter, and that in any case, he would consider both national welfare and people's livelihood, and would not allow the people to suffer from unemployment or starvation. It is said that after talking with the representatives, he went to meet with Wang Boling for a detailed conversation, and on the morning of the 21st, he went to the wharf to directly investigate everything.</p>

<p>First Met with Hu Hanmin in the South, Then Met with Various Comrades in Guangdong</p>
<p>All Parties Unanimously Advocate for a Combination Through Peaceful Means</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, CCP Central Committee member Wang Chonghui traveled south from Shanghai on the 9th of this month to meet with various Central Committee members residing in Hong Kong and Guangdong. In his personal capacity, he exchanged opinions on the current situation. The results were quite satisfactory. Wang left Hong Kong on the 19th aboard the Changxing Company's Canadian Empress and arrived in Shanghai yesterday at noon. He plans to rest in Shanghai briefly before going north to convey the opinions of the Central Committee members in Hong Kong and Guangdong to the Central Government. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon: Wang, accompanied by his secretary Zhu Yongshou, left Hong Kong on the 19th aboard the Changxing Company's Canadian Empress and arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 AM yesterday. The ship docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Those who came to welcome him included Tang Haian, representing the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi; Tang Shixuan, representing Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng; former Minister of Judicial Administration Wei Daoming; former President of the Jiangsu High Court Lin Biao; Legislative Committee member Zhu Lühe; Section Chief of the Ministry of Judicial Administration Yang Kentang; former Chargé d'affaires in Paris Xie Weilun; Xiao Jinfang; Peng Sihua; and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers. After disembarking, Wang went directly to visit friends by car. He did not return to the World Academy on Fook Hing Road to rest until the afternoon.</p>
<p>Statement: Wang issued a written statement on the ship saying, "I originally intended to take a vacation to travel around various places in the country to broaden my knowledge. I did not want to interfere in politics. However, after returning to the country, I witnessed the increasingly dangerous state of our country and a future that is truly unimaginable. I humbly take it upon myself to fulfill the responsibility of a common citizen, and with the encouragement of friends, I have visited comrades from all sides, hoping to communicate their opinions and seek a common method of saving the country. According to my personal observation, all parties unanimously advocate for a combination through peaceful means to relieve the national crisis and turn danger into safety. This is somewhat comforting to the public." Wang also said, "During my visit to Hong Kong, I first met with Mr. Hu Hanmin. Mr. Hu expressed that although my views have differed from those of others in recent years, they were purely about matters and not about people. If the authorities can be diligent in governing, I will have no objections." Later, in Guangzhou, I had discussions with various comrades, all of whom hoped that we could meet each other with sincerity. Although our political views may differ, it is not difficult to reach a consensus. As for the details of the exchange of opinions, I regret that I cannot tell you everything. If you ask how the results will be, it all depends on the extent to which they are accepted after being conveyed. It is still difficult to speculate at this time."</p>

As for whether Mr. Hu Hanmin will go to Beijing to attend the Fifth National Congress, it has not yet been decided.</p>

<h3 id="e93">The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Retransmits Telegrams Protesting the Taxation of Goods from Other Provinces in Guangdong <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Machine-Made Western-Style Goods Should Be Excluded</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly sent telegrams protesting the taxation of goods from other provinces in Guangdong Province. Recently, it was heard that Guangdong Province plans to implement it on a fixed date. The Chamber sent another telegram to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Guangdong Provincial Government in Nanjing yesterday, stating: (Omitted title) Since the abolition of the Likin Bureau, according to the order of the National Government, the transfer of goods within the country, except for transit tariffs or consolidated taxes, should not be subject to any other taxes between provinces. This is an immutable rule based on tax law. Guangdong Province previously argued that it was protecting local products and planned to levy a protection tax on goods imported from other provinces. The affiliated association has repeatedly telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Government, stating that this matter should be handled by each province in accordance with the national anti-dumping tax law and should only be levied on foreign goods, which would be more in line with the original intent of the legislation. There should be no such thing as separate territories within the same country, mistakenly using the tariff war in Europe to build barriers within the wall. If this happens, factories in the Yangtze River area will be ruined and irreparable. Once this trend starts, retaliation will follow, and Guangdong's local products will inevitably be rejected everywhere, resulting in a lose-lose situation. This has been said many times in the past. Later, the Guangdong provincial government respected the tax system, maintained domestic products, and sought ways to benefit each other. Therefore, the affiliated association also specially sent the sugar magnate Zheng Zenan to negotiate and promote the sale of Guangdong sugar in order to promote the cooperation of domestic products. Unexpectedly, according to the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Daily, the protection tax is planned to be levied in January of next year, and the clause exempting machine-made Western-style goods will also be cancelled. The last hope for Shanghai's domestic goods factories has once again vanished. Upon hearing this, everyone sighed. In recent years, Shanghai factories have relied on the Yangtze River and the southern provinces for sales due to domestic unrest and the war in North China. If South China hinders sales with a protection tax, the market will shrink further. Guangdong is the first to do so, and other provinces will follow suit. A province is like a foreign country. Where can factories find a place to survive? Shanghai merchants regard this as a matter of life and death for industry and cannot sit idly by. It is requested that the Executive Yuan and Ministry consider the overall situation and order the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance to handle the matter according to the original proposal. This is fair and convenient. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Economic Expert Yu Huanzheng Discusses the Infeasibility of the Gold Exchange Standard <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>No Reason to Implement Currency Inflation</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, due to the recent increase in the silver export tax, rumors are rampant, and market prices fluctuate greatly, causing public anxiety. The Xinxin News Agency reporter interviewed Yu Huanzheng, a renowned economic expert who studies gold and silver issues and is the former Deputy Governor of the Bank of China, to ask for his opinion. Yu said that he had previously advocated for increasing the silver tax and published an article on the economic supplement of the Shen Bao and the Shen Bao Monthly. Now that the government has implemented it, it is only intended to curb the export of silver. However, some people suspect that it is to change to the gold exchange standard and inflate the currency to lower its value. In my opinion, I dare to say that this will never happen. I wrote an article opposing the gold exchange standard after the Kemal currency system opinion was published, saying that it cannot be done, is not feasible, and is not necessary (There is a manuscript in the Banking Weekly and a lecture on gold and silver issues). This is such an important matter that even Kemal advocated changing it gradually by region. How can the government reform the standard recklessly without any preparation? As for currency inflation and lowering the currency value, only the United States has this method. Those who are generally unaware of the financial situation believe that our country can also imitate it. The economy of our country has not escaped the position of semi-colony. This is undeniable. I ask, before the United States reduced the gold content of its coins, it first concentrated the cash in the hands of the government. Can our government concentrate the silver stored in domestic and foreign banks one by one? If it cannot be concentrated, then it is like Dong Shi imitating Xi Shi, only to repeat the old dramas of the Bank of Communications suspending exchange and the Wuhan Hanchao banknotes. Not only will the business market be greatly disrupted, but the government's financial revenue will also be greatly reduced. Capital flight and falling public bonds are even more inevitable. How can the enlightened financial authorities be so unaware of the benefits and harms that they imitate warlords and communists to harm the people and themselves? Therefore, I dare to say that this will never happen and there is no reason for it. The current government seems to be trending towards flattening the exchange rate and stabilizing silver prices. There is already an organization of the Foreign Exchange Market Stabilization Committee, which will naturally stabilize people's hearts and the market in the future when it is effectively implemented. As for the follow-up measures after adding the silver tax, such as promoting exports to reduce imports and exports and reducing the difference between domestic and foreign silver prices to prevent smuggling, it is a long story and cannot be fully explained. The key to using it lies in the heart, and we must wait for the environment to respond to the plan. It cannot be fully explained in words.</p>

<p>This is Truly a Talk Without Any Financial Common Sense</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance, based on the request of the Shanghai Silver Industry Association and others to find a way to prevent the export of silver, implemented the imposition of silver export tax on the 15th of this month, huge changes have taken place in the trading of various exchanges in the city. In particular, the gold rush has been the most significant. After the Ministry of Finance explained it once, the turmoil subsided slightly. Recently, a rumor has spread that our country will lower the currency value and inflate the currency, causing anxiety again. The Xinxin News Agency reporter went to Kong's residence on West Asam Road at 8:00 PM last night to visit Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and ask about everything. Kong received him and said that the Ministry of Finance's imposition of silver export tax this time is intended to prevent smuggling and maintain the difference between domestic and foreign silver prices, and at the same time promote the export of domestic products in order to reduce imports and exports. As for the rumors that the currency value will be reduced and currency inflation will occur, it is completely unfounded. It should be known that our country's silver coins are scattered in the hands of the people, so how can they be reduced? This is truly a lack of financial common sense.</p>

<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Ministry of Railways borrowed 16 million yuan from the China Construction Silver Company and the Sino-British Silver Company to complete the Chancao section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. The draft contract has been signed. A Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from the banking community yesterday that after the loan is successful, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus will begin bidding and construction will begin. The roadbed has been surveyed and the earthwork project will be started first. Except for the bridge foundation on the Cao'e River, which has already been built, the section from the Cao'e River to Shaoxing is 31 kilometers long, and the section from Shaoxing to Xixing is 47 kilometers long, with a total length of about 78 kilometers. As for the China Construction Silver Company and the Sino-British Silver Company, which are borrowing the money, they have decided to issue bonds and sell them abroad, imitating the Sino-British Silver Company loan method for the two railways. The interest rate is said to be 5%. Because foreign interest rates are mostly 3-4%, these 5% bonds are guaranteed to be reliable, and the credit of the two railways is well-known, so it is expected that sales will be good in the future.</p>

<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Chinese cotton mills have recently increased the consolidated tax on cotton yarn by the Ministry of Finance on November 1, which has exacerbated the crisis in the yarn industry and urgently needs government relief. How can we increase the burden again? Manufacturers from all over the country have telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Ministry, and Cotton Consolidated Tax Association to call for the cancellation of the previous proposal. The Wuxi Cotton Spinning Industry Association telegraphed the Shanghai Cotton Consolidated Tax Association, the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry to appeal for exemption from the increase, the original text of which reads: "I have recently heard news of an increase in the consolidated tax on cotton yarn. Roads are spreading rumors, and the industry is panicking. It has been found that the seven factories affiliated with our association, including Shenxin No. 3, Zhenxin, Qingfeng, Guangqin, Lixin, Yukang, and Fuxing, are on the verge of bankruptcy due to the impact of Japanese goods dumping and the decline of agricultural products. On October 17 of this year, they telegraphed to appeal for a reduction in the consolidated tax, but they were not approved. They were still hesitating when alarming news came that the government was instead planning to increase taxes, which is tantamount to strangling the dying. According to reports, the Chinese Cotton Mill Federation and its branches in various places have telegraphed to appeal. The factories affiliated with our association, which are located in the interior and are cotton mills in recent years, are in a depressed state and feel particularly painful. If the government really intends to increase taxes, we urge you to consider that the domestic cotton yarn weaving industry has suffered deeply and can no longer bear the burden. Please immediately cancel this proposal. Otherwise, the manufacturers' livelihoods will be ruined, and the government's tax revenue will also be reduced, which is detrimental to both. Under the pressure of the situation, the factories affiliated with our association are sending this telegram to beg you. If our request is not granted, we will have to suspend operations and await orders. In urgent hope, we respectfully ask you to consider.

<p>The Top Rice is Only 11.8 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, new rice from various places is successively entering the market, and rice prices in the city are gradually declining. The current top rice is 11.2 yuan, medium grade is 10.4 to 10 yuan, broken japonica is 11 yuan, new indica rice is scarce, and Duzi indica is 10 cents lower. Indica rice is 10.05 to 9.9 yuan, and Duzi indica is 10.03 to 9.7 yuan. According to observations by people in the rice industry, rice prices in the city this year have been affected by drought, locust plagues, floods, and hailstorms. Therefore, although new rice is successively entering the market in Kunshan, Changshu, Suzhou, and other places, the yield is not high, so it is difficult to expect a rebound.

<p>Discussing the Affairs of Sichuan Aftermath and Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Meeting with Zhang Qun and He Chengjun Under Liu's Command</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Deng Mingjie, Liu Xiang's Shanghai representative who is the Director of Sichuan Rehabilitation and Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression, went to Nanjing from Shanghai and met with President Wang to discuss everything. After returning to Shanghai a few days ago, he went to Nanjing on the 11:00 PM express train the night before to meet with Chairman Zhang Qun of Hubei and He Chengjun to discuss the affairs of Sichuan aftermath and bandit suppression. Liu Xiang has decided to dispel his intention to resign and formally resume his position. According to Deng, before leaving Shanghai, when talking to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency about the recent situation in Sichuan and the bandit situation on the Guizhou border, Liu Xiang had repeatedly met with various generals after returning to Chengdu. Careful decisions have been made regarding the military deployment for bandit suppression and the fundraising of military pay. The generals, in light of the dangerous situation, mostly advocate meeting each other with sincerity. Once the formal meeting concludes, the generals will return to their original defenses and begin a general offensive. Currently, Director Liu will return to Chongqing to preside over military affairs after arrangements are completed in Chengdu. His attitude is gradually becoming more positive, and the future of the Sichuan situation has seen significant progress. As for the bandit situation on the Guizhou border, although it was tense for a time after the two bandits Xiao Ke and He Long sneaked in, the bandit forces have been sharply reduced and the encirclement has been completed thanks to the joint suppression of the armies of Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Guizhou. The bandits have lost their footing in the advance and retreat. Recently, the report from Tian (Zongyi) Brigade of the Sichuan Army in Shanghai stated that since contacting the bandits, they have advanced to Longchi in Guizhou Province on the 18th, cutting the bandits into two sides. One part collapsed towards Cheweiping, and the other fled to Xiaojing. Numerous spoils of war were seized, and the bandits suffered even more casualties. They are currently being pursued.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Fourth Board Meeting of the International Society <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>And Invitation to Pei Fuhang for a Lecture</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the International Society, since its registration with the Central Public Movement Guidance Committee, has been actively carrying out its affairs. The society held its fourth board meeting at the Sino-French Friendship Association on Route Lafayette at 2 PM yesterday, and invited Pei Fuhang, the president of the National Shanghai College of Commerce, to give a lecture entitled "The Attitude of Cultural Movement Advocates." Attendees included all board members such as Wang Shanji, Xu Shipu, Li Lixia, and Yang Li. Liu Chuanzhong chaired the meeting, Gu Gaoyang served as the recorder, and Shen Zuru reported on the cultural movement situation. Wang Shanji and He Xueni reported on the society's affairs, followed by Pei Fuhang's lecture. Finally, resolutions were discussed and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Pei's Lecture briefly stated that in recent decades, the domestic cultural movement has repeatedly failed because those engaged in the cultural movement either made empty promises without being practical, falling into the pedantic and empty shortcomings of Song Confucian commentary, or advocated for practical learning, engaging in textual research and exegesis, following the old habits of Han scholars who did not discuss matters of principle, in order to avoid the realities of the environment. Both of these approaches were of no benefit to the real society. Therefore, past cultural movements flourished for a time, but morale continued to decline, and the national situation was on the verge of collapse. Those engaged in cultural work in the future should change their past mistakes and take the practical learning spirit of Yan Xizhai in the early Qing Dynasty as the standard, that is, learning and thought should be integrated with life and behavior. Apart from practice and practical work, there is no such thing as learning, which is also the spirit of practical work and vigorous action advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. All cultural movement advocates, as long as everyone can start from their own behavior, can naturally achieve practical results. The current domestic cultural movement, centered on the New Life Movement, should be practical and personally practice it, and should no longer deceive with empty words. In short, as long as the cultural route is clearly identified, it should be implemented without empty talk or evasion of reality. This is the correct attitude for cultural movement advocates. He wished to offer this idea to the comrades of the society and wished the society a bright future.</p>
<p>Resolutions (1) It is recommended to the Central Government to instruct all specialized schools and above in the country to add lectures on Japanese issues, and Wang Shanji and Zhang Shiyuan are delegated to draft the reasons and methods, and submit them to the Standing Committee for review and issuance. (2) The following issues will be the focus of discussion for the society recently: 1. The impact of the Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations on the Far East; 2. The Central European issue; 3. The revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance; 4. The pros and cons of our government increasing silver export taxes. (3) Invite Pei Fuhang, Wu Songgao, Tao Xisheng, Xiong Mengfei, Zhang Songnian, Zhang Yuanruo, Luo Dunwei, Gang Hengyi and other gentlemen to be honorary directors of the society. (4) Member Wen Guangyi of this society will go to the UK, and Wen should be designated to be responsible for organizing the London branch of the society in London.</p>

<p>Zhang Chuqing Presides Over the Ceremony, Yu Qiaqing and Others Give Speeches</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, Fuzhou Changan Steamship Company, China Merchant Ship Officers Association, and Wusong Fisheries School Alumni Association held a memorial service for the young navigator Sha Huijia at the Lake Society Hall on Guizhou Road at 2 PM yesterday. Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Chuqing, Jin Yueshi, Hou Zongqing, Zhang Junyi, Yang Yue'an, Chen Zhongping, Zhang Jidan, Yu Angxiao, Yu Zhuyun, Wang Yunfu, Qian Cangshuo, Bao Yuqiu and others, totaling more than 200 people, attended. Zhang Chuqing, the principal of Wusong Fisheries School, presided over the ceremony. After the music was played and the sacrifice was made, Zhang Junyi reported on Sha's life, detailing Sha's intelligence and diligence when he was at school, and his outstanding achievements after graduation. Then, Yu Qiaqing, a leader in the shipping industry, Jin Yueshi, a pioneer in the officers industry, and Hou Zongqing, a technician from the Ministry of Industry, gave speeches one after another, expressing their regret over Sha's death, and encouraging their surviving comrades to continue their efforts in order to achieve the goal of fully regaining navigation rights. Yu's speech lasted for an hour, recounting his 40 years of hard work in the shipping industry and the various processes of striving for the status of Chinese officers, which was particularly sincere and moving. Yu concluded by saying that Sha's death was not only a misfortune for his individual and his family, but also a great loss to our country's shipping industry. Finally, Sha's brother, Sha Yujia of the Sanbei Company, led his family to express their gratitude, and the memorial service presented the guests with a portrait of Sha as a memento. Then the music was played and the ceremony was completed. Sha graduated from Wusong Fisheries School in 1911 and served in the navigation industry for more than ten years. Two years ago, he joined the Shanghai Pilot Association as a pilot and also served as a member of the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau's Ship Collision and Dispute Resolution Committee. His academic ability and talent were admired by both Chinese and foreigners. Unfortunately, he passed away this summer at the age of 31. Everyone, whether they knew him or not, mourned the loss of a backbone figure in our country's shipping industry. Yesterday, the memorial hall was filled with words of mourning, with almost no space left. Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Xiaoruo, Yuan Ludeng, Zhao Yuntai and others from the shipping industry, Jiao Dingxi, Chen Ganqing, Jin Yueshi and others from the navigation industry, and relatives, teachers and friends Xia Yiting, Qin Yuan, Yang Ying and others all sent wreaths and elegiac scrolls.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Results of the Japanese Goods Sample Exhibition Were a Major Failure <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Newspaper Reports That It Failed to Attract Chinese People</p>
<p>Participating Stores Returned Disappointed</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Daily News yesterday, the sample exhibition initiated by the Wholesale Guidance Society was held on the 8th at the original site of the Beifu Department Store. More than 50 general merchandise stores from Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and other places participated in the exhibition. Initially, it was originally scheduled to be held at the Yipinsan Hotel, but it was changed due to opposition from the Chinese side. At that time, various operators had various discussions, and some felt that this trial opening was quite important. As a result, it was a major failure. However, the newspaper reports all said that the sample market was a great success, and even the goods sold amounted to more than 300,000 yuan, and the future prospects were very optimistic. The general public believed it to be true. Who knew that in reality, the contracts signed during the three-day sample market by various participating groups who stayed in Shanghai for more than ten days did not reach 20,000 yuan, which was less than one-tenth of the claimed 300,000 yuan. The main reason for its great failure was that the change of address from Yipinsan Hotel to the original site of Beifu Department Store resulted in Chinese merchants all holding back. As a result, the planned plan was completely shattered. Although 2,000 people were invited, the Chinese people mostly visited and left, and there was hardly any negotiation or sales. Therefore, all the participating stores returned disappointed. This was due to the failure to recognize the situation in the Chinese market, but it was also due to the recession in mainland China. Only Japanese exporters to China, misled by the timing, suffered this unexpected adverse effect, and were dissatisfied by those who argued that the timing was too early.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Catholic Church Held Global Mission Day Yesterday <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Catholic Church has been spreading around the world for nineteen centuries. At present, the number of believers has reached more than 400 million. In addition to the majority of developed countries in Europe and the United States, there are more than 300 dioceses in the missionary areas of Asia, Africa, and Australia. About 20,000 priests are engaged in missionary work in distant places. If we include the male and female monks and teachers who assist, there are as many as 220,000 people. The religious, educational, and charitable undertakings they run, only counting within the missionary area, have 56,300 large and small churches, more than 37,300 men's and women's schools, more than 2,289,000 male and female students, more than 770 hospitals, more than 36,300 hospital beds, more than 110 leprosariums, 12,800 hospital beds, more than 1,970 orphanages, more than 113,000 orphans, more than 430 nursing homes, more than 17,700 elderly people, and countless other similar good deeds. The cost of their establishment and maintenance is very large, and relies on the generous donations of believers. The former Pope Benedict XV, in order to encourage believers to enthusiastically support missionary work, designated the second Sunday before the end of October each year as Mission Day. Missionary organizations in all countries around the world have obeyed and enthusiastically held it. The current Pope Pius XI is enthusiastic about missionary work, and his achievements are remarkable. He has repeatedly ordered the world to expand publicity. This year, Archbishop Cai Ning came to China to represent the Pope in managing church affairs. Cai had previously worked in the Propaganda Headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church for many years, and was very enthusiastic about supporting missionary work. In addition to the declaration issued by Secretary-General Jiang translated into Chinese and distributed, he also personally sent official letters to the leaders of dioceses across the country, calling for unanimous and enthusiastic holding of the event. The Catholic churches in Shanghai have already done this. In the Mass yesterday morning (the 21st), the priests of each church gave speeches on the importance of missionary work. In addition to instructing believers to pray enthusiastically, they also encouraged the public to donate generously to missionary expenses, or set up donation boxes in the church, or send students to solicit donations on the spot. The money will be sent by the head priests of each church to Bishop Hui in this district, and then sent to the Propaganda Headquarters in Rome, where the minister will allocate it to missionary areas around the world according to the needs of each diocese. On this day, the Vatican Radio Station used multiple languages to broadcast missionary speeches to the world to spread publicity.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Xiong Case Scheduled for Trial <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>After the reactionary element Xiong Guohua surrendered, he was assassinated by rioters sent by the Communist Party in the Qianji Hotel where Xiong was staying last month. Xiong was shot and injured, and the police sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment and assigned a detective to monitor him in the hospital. Unexpectedly, the rioters broke into the hospital ward again, killed Xiong with a pistol, and also shot and killed the resident detective and a Chinese constable sent by the French police to the hospital to treat the patient. After the incident, the police organs were extremely active, hoping to catch the murderer as soon as possible. Soon, within a day or two after the incident, ten male and female criminals were captured one after another, and a secret party's organization was uncovered on the third floor of the Xinwenxiang Silver Shop in the French Concession. Twenty-seven pistols, two bombs, a steel vest, and many reactionary printed materials were seized on the spot. They have been twice handed over to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for review, but both times were deemed to be important and forbade public attendance during the investigation period. Now, it is heard that the male and female criminals in the entire case have been secretly interrogated by the Second Branch of the Higher Court twice. The Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that these people have also committed major crimes in the Chinese territory, and specially prepared a document by Director Wen, consulting the Second Branch of the Higher Court to allow the criminals to be temporarily taken away by the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Later, when the bureau concluded the interrogation and sent them back to the Second Branch of the Higher Court, the French Concession police stated that since a large number of weapons were found in the French Concession, the criminals must have also committed violence in the French Concession, so they also sent a letter to the court after the Public Security Bureau, requesting the court to allow the criminals to be taken to the Third Branch of the Higher Court. After several investigations and interrogations, the trial has now been completed. A few days ago, they were still sent back to the Second Branch of the Higher Court and handed over to the police and women's prison for detention separately. The Second Branch of the Higher Court has also scheduled the trial to begin officially on the 29th of this month. At this trial, the police will list the crimes obtained from the investigation and file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. At that time, if there are no special reasons, the trial may be open to the public, and those with tickets will be allowed to attend.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Severe Drought in Tongxiang County, County Magistrate Comes to Shanghai to Raise Relief Funds <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Tongxiang County in Zhejiang Province is adjacent to Haining and Haiyan. This summer, the drought has been extraordinarily severe. The rivers have dried up and turned into barren land. The fields are cracked and unable to be sown. All agricultural by-products have withered. The disaster victims are selling their children to cook food and begging for food. Suicides by the whole family are often heard, which is very pitiful. The local officials and local gentry first raised funds in the interior, but due to the continuous commercial depression in recent years, it is difficult to collect large amounts of money. Therefore, in order to raise relief funds widely, the legal groups jointly elected Liu Jiahhou, the representative of the county party department, Shen Guangxiong, the county magistrate, and the gentry Shen Qiluo and Shen Songsheng, etc., to come to Shanghai to discuss emergency relief measures with the fellow villagers in Shanghai. Lu Jianquan, Xu Guannan, and Xu Xiaoxia invited the fellow villagers in Shanghai to gather at Xu's residence on North Zhejiang Road for discussion. Attendees included County Magistrate Shen, Shen Songsheng, Liu Jiahhou, Guang Qiluo, Lu Jianquan, Xu Guannan, Xu Xiaoxia, Xu Xuying, Lu Feibo, Shen Luyi, Yan Shaohe, Yan Duhe, Cheng Zhihe, Cheng Muxian, Chen Kuisheng, Zhang Zounong, Zhang Zhuxian, Hu Yangqian, Xu Pinshao, Xia Jinhou and other more than a dozen people. First, County Magistrate Shen presided over the meeting, reporting on the failure of the initial relief efforts to pump water and the provincial plan, and requesting the fellow villagers abroad to assist in disaster relief. Liu Jiahhou then stated that the disaster in the county was serious, and the tragic situation was unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. It was decided on the spot that the current priority is to raise emergency relief funds and distribute rice. As for the future implementation of work relief, including the county's water conservancy and other matters, funds will be allocated by the provincial government for further discussion. Currently, only two items, the distribution of wheat seeds and rice, have been reduced in scope. Even with a smaller plan, it is still impossible to do without 100,000 yuan. In fact, there are more than 40,000 people in the county who cannot survive without relief. Donation registration books were filled out on the spot, and a total of 4,150 yuan was obtained. This is a drop in the bucket and still does not solve the problem. Therefore, the donation registration books were distributed again, asking the fellow villagers abroad to be responsible for soliciting donations. The other fellow villagers are scattered abroad and their addresses are unknown. After verification, the donation registration books will be sent by letter one after another. It was also agreed that the communication address and collection address of the disaster relief association in Shanghai would be Xu's residence at No. 61, Beizhejiang Road, North of the Old Garbage Bridge in Shanghai. At the same time, Zhang Zhuxian and Xia Jinhou were appointed as general affairs of the documents to jointly plan the progress.</p>

<p>Decision to Implement on November 1</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received an order from the province to organize the baojia system throughout the county from November 1. Since the deadline stipulated in the provincial order was approaching, it convened a meeting the day before to discuss the methods. The chiefs of various districts and the head of the First Section, Wang Xuepeng, the technical director Qi Kezhong, and the county magistrate Pan Zhongjia attended the meeting, and Cao Yuanxun took the minutes. Matters for discussion (1) Draft the budget for the compilation and investigation of baojia, and it was resolved to amend and approve it. (2) In accordance with the regulations, the schedule for the formation of baojia is as follows: the first phase is 20 days, the second phase is 50 days, and the third phase is 50 days, for a total of four months. The area of this county is less than 500 square miles, and the population is less than 26,000 households, and the self-raised funds are extremely tight. Should the deadline for compilation and investigation be shortened to 75 days, the first phase is 15 days, the second phase is 30 days, and the third phase is 30 days, so as to complete the work as soon as possible and save costs? The proposal was resolved and passed. (3) Decide on the date to start the compilation and investigation. It was resolved to set November 1. (4) The past neighborhood organization of this county is relatively complete. Can the existing neighborhood be reorganized this time? The proposal was resolved and passed. (5) In accordance with the regulations, before starting the baojia, the chiefs of each district, the assistants of the district, and the compilation and investigation committee members should be convened to hold a training course to teach the significance of the formation of baojia. How should the aforementioned training course be organized? It was resolved to convene before the 25th of this month. (6) Should each district convene township chiefs to hold training courses so that they can thoroughly understand the significance and procedures of the baojia? It was resolved to be convened separately by each district. (7) How should this county widely publicize the compilation and investigation of baojia? It was resolved that in addition to printing slogans and publicizing to the public, the Education Bureau should be ordered to instruct all schools and social education institutions in the county to do their best to publicize it, and publish a special issue on baojia.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The South District Rent Reduction Association Petitions the Executive Yuan to Resolve the Rent Reduction <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Rent Reduction Disputes Open Up Unprecedented Litigation</p>
<p>Earnestly Instructing and Comforting the Desire of the Whole Shanghai Citizens</p>
<p>The South District Rent Reduction Association submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, saying: "We are submitting this document because the rent reduction dispute is becoming increasingly serious. We earnestly request that you give clear instructions to comfort the people." We once, in a fast mail telegram on August 5, outlined the depression in Shanghai and the difficulty in bearing the heavy rent. We hope that you will clearly reduce the rent to relieve the people. Now, if this is prolonged, it will cause a rent litigation that has never been seen in China, and the feelings between the host and the guest will be hurt more and more, and the situation will become increasingly worse. If we look at Shanghai superficially, its boats and vehicles are crowded and people are bustling, but in fact, the prices are reduced to seek sales, and the goods are sold out. The north and south cities are all the same. This is actually because the shops are trying their best to support it in order to decorate the first-class commercial port and plan for its future recovery. Moreover, Shanghai has always been known as an inch of gold. Even if it is a snail's house, the rent is strangely expensive. Anyone who travels to Shanghai knows this. In addition, recently, various businesses have fallen sharply. Some have stopped and closed, and even more have tightened. They have been forced to dismiss employees and reduce salaries in order to maintain the status quo. Therefore, the current market situation in Shanghai, although golden and jade on the outside, is actually ruined on the inside. Moreover, the four major needs of life are clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Clothing, food, and transportation can still be saved, but the matter of housing cannot allow the whole family to live in the open every day. We are following the legacy of President Sun Yat-sen and entrusted by the citizens to run around and appeal, hoping to help businesses and revitalize Shanghai. However, the landlords who see profit and forget righteousness all use real estate as speculation and ignore President Sun Yat-sen's principle of people's livelihood. This is very painful. Now, we have found that rent reductions in the capital, Anqing, have been implemented long ago, and Hangzhou in Zhejiang is also planning to implement it by the municipal government. Although the Shanghai municipal government has already understood the people's difficulties, it has not made a correct statement, resulting in the citizens' public anger under the coercion of the wealthy, stopping payment of rent and depositing it in the bank on a monthly basis, waiting for a solution. However, the landlords who are good at litigation often file lawsuits on the grounds of rent resistance. Fortunately, the government and the court deeply understand this and deal with it with love and peace. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in the midst of military affairs, still thinks of the people of Shanghai who are suffering. You are a veteran of the party and the country and a star of the people's fortune. In all the past things, all the actions that benefit the country and the people have been carried out with the spirit of "If I don't jump into the fire pit, who will jump into the fire pit? If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell?" as the vanguard of the people. Now, we have to report the suffering of the citizens and the fact of the city's depression, hoping that you will care about the people's suffering, rescue the people's livelihood, and give clear instructions to order the Shanghai municipal government to resolve it quickly, so as to relieve the people's difficulties and revitalize the city's appearance, and to comfort the 3 million residents of Shanghai who are in deep trouble. This is a matter of both public virtue and convenience. We respectfully present this document to Wang, the president of the Executive Yuan."</p>

However, all sectors of society feel that the previous concerts were mostly attended by students, and professors did not participate, which is a pity. The professors of the school, unable to refuse the request, agreed to hold two concerts this year, so that all sectors of society have the opportunity to hear the elegant performances. Since Principal Xiao Youmei and the professors have worked hard to manage and plan the school, the achievements have been excellent, and there is no match for them for a time. The professors are all leading music experts. This concert, which is jointly hosted by them, can be said to be a rare opportunity and a grand event in the music scene. It is heard that the first concert will be held in the grand auditorium on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel. Ticket offices: 1325 Route Lafayette, the school's office, Nanjing Road's Motelli, New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road, and other piano shops.</p>

<p>Discussing Important Policies Such as Disaster Relief and Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>It is reported that Liu Xueya, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, came to Shanghai on official business to discuss matters with Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance. It is now learned that the Huining Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai, considering Liu's governance of Anhui and his many plans for important policies such as bandit suppression and construction, especially his recent personal visit to Tunxi to consolidate the defenses of Huining, specially recommended representatives Cao Zhigong and Zhang Yizhai to visit him at his residence yesterday. They planned to hold a welcome meeting. Liu personally received them and inquired in detail about the situation in Huining and the circumstances of the fellow-villagers in Shanghai. He said that he had to depart for Nanjing that night, then proceed to Wuhu and Tunxi, so he could not have a pleasant gathering with the fellow-villagers in Shanghai, which he regretted. As for disaster relief and bandit suppression, he already had a comprehensive plan and hoped that the fellow-villagers abroad would contribute their opinions at any time. He would stay in Anhui for a short time to organize everything. They talked for about an hour before taking their leave. It is said that Liu has already departed by night train last night and will arrive in Tunxi tomorrow. The association has sent telegrams to various organizations in Huizhou to prepare a welcome.</p>

<p>Portrait of the Late Cao Xuegeng</p>
<p>Wang's Speech: Gathering today in this hall of great men, one cannot help but think of the small and narrow spaces of the YMCA on Suzhou Road, Beijing Road, and Nanjing Road in the past. How could there be such success today without the great contributions of Mr. Cao? Mr. Cao served the YMCA for more than 20 years, truly working hard and achieving great merit. It was not easy to bring the YMCA to this point, so it is worthy of our commemoration. His strengths as a person can also serve as a model for us. He had perseverance, willpower, and did not avoid difficulties. He served the YMCA for more than 20 years, never slacking off, and eventually became ill due to his hard work. The YMCA has such a solid foundation today entirely because of the meticulous organization of Mr. Cao in the past. Therefore, Mr. Cao is a good example for us and a good example for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Cao's Biography: Cao Xigeng, also known as Cao Xuegeng, was from Jiaxing. He was born on November 16, 1873. His father, Zibin, was a famous pastor of the Methodist Church, renowned in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. His mother, née Yan, was the aunt of the current Ambassador Yan Huiqing. Cao grew up in Suzhou. After graduating from elementary school, he studied at a certain high school in Kobe, Japan. After returning to China, he entered St. John's University and graduated in 1893. He then became a teacher at the Zhongxi Academy. In 1898, Louis from the United States came to Shanghai to establish the YMCA. Cao strongly supported its establishment, planning and managing it, and his contributions were particularly great. In 1900, at the request of the directors and members of the YMCA, Cao officially became the general secretary of the association. After taking office, he made many reforms, such as establishing a middle school, purchasing land for the association buildings on Sichuan Road and Eight Immortals Bridge, and building the youth building of the West Sichuan Road association building. These are his most prominent achievements. As for the construction of other projects, they are too numerous to list. His achievements were great. Cao went to the United States three times for the affairs of the association, working diligently and tirelessly, and eventually became ill due to his hard work. In 1920, he returned to China from the United States. Because he was weak and unable to work hard, the doctor advised him to rest. Therefore, in December of that year, he resigned from his position as general secretary of the YMCA and went to Beiping for recuperation. The board of directors then invited Cao to serve as honorary general secretary. Whenever there were important projects, they still consulted him. Cao was calm, decisive, and full of a sense of responsibility. He did not discriminate in his service, such as assisting in the formation of the Youth Association, assisting the Hankou YMCA in building an association building for the summer conference, and purchasing the Zhujia Yan base. He worked hard without complaint and did not avoid difficulties. His assistance to neighboring associations in their work and the training of talents for the YMCA are even smaller matters. Cao passed away from illness in Shanghai on the night of February 23, 1927, at the age of 55.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bar Association, for the case of student Qian Shaofeng, who killed He Zunfu, the former magistrate of An'nan County, Guizhou, in revenge for his father's death, after the Second Special District Court sentenced Qian Shaofeng to seven years in prison, Qian abandoned the appeal because his father's revenge had been taken. After Qian Shusheng, Qian's defense lawyer, reviewed the case file and found that it met the amnesty regulations, he specially suggested that the association forward it to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for submission to the National Government, so that an amnesty decree could be granted. It is now learned that the case has been decided by the Bar Association to be forwarded to the Executive Yuan. A letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan has been received, instructing the association to submit the request directly to the Judicial Yuan. After receiving the letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, the association has now drafted a memorial and copied the entire judgment of the case and the correspondence between the Second Special District Court and An'nan County regarding the investigation, and sent it by post to the Judicial Yuan for submission to the National Government for an amnesty decree to release the student Qian Shaofeng from prison.</p>

<p>More Than Seven Thousand Yuan Not Paid in Cash</p>
<p>Mitsui &amp; Co. Reported the Arrest</p>
<p>The China Industrial Bank at 172 Nanjing Road in this city recently declared bankruptcy on the 11th of this month due to huge losses and financial difficulties. It was also discovered that Qin Baoyuan, the manager of the bank, had absconded with more than 40,000 yuan. Afterward, the board of directors appointed attorney Zhang Ding and accountant Xu Chao to jointly liquidate the assets. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Qin Baoyuan, the absconding manager of the bank, and Lu Xihou, a managing director, jointly signed a bank draft of the bank before the bankruptcy, amounting to 7,695 yuan, which was to be paid to the Japanese company Mitsui &amp; Co. It was not cashed due to the bankruptcy. However, Mitsui &amp; Co. believes that although the manager has absconded, the managing director should be responsible, especially since they jointly signed the draft. They negotiated with Lu repeatedly without result. They had no choice but to file a complaint with the Central Police Station, accusing him of fraud. Therefore, the police arrested Lu and Sun Xiren of the Xinhua Trading Company, who was also involved in the case, at about 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, and took them to the police station for temporary detention, pending submission to the court for investigation this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e123">China Aviation Corporation Ordered to Prepare for the Yunnan Air Route <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Expenses of 250,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Using the Latest Twin-Engine Aircraft</p>
<p>The China Aviation Corporation, in order to develop transportation and in response to the demands of all sectors, had planned to open the Yunnan air route. Now, it has been ordered to speed up preparations, and the preparatory expenses of 250,000 yuan have been approved. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Request to Open and Two Test Flights: Yunnan is located in the remote west, where transportation is inconvenient, and there are many high mountains and steep ridges, like a paradise outside the world. The people of the area have collectively requested the central government to open an air route to facilitate transportation. The China Aviation Corporation sent aircraft to conduct two test flights last year, one departing from Chongqing and one departing from Guangdong. However, both were unsuccessful due to bad weather and the inability to use a single-engine aircraft freely. Moreover, the expenses were huge, so it was delayed indefinitely until now.</p>
<p>Preparatory Expenses of 50,000 Yuan Allocated: Now, due to the urgent need for transportation and the need for development, Long Yun, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, requested the central government to prepare for the project early, and it was approved. The China Aviation Corporation was instructed to prepare quickly. The Yunnan airport and radio, etc., are being actively prepared by the _ party. The preparatory expenses of 250,000 yuan have been approved and 50,000 yuan has already been allocated.</p>
<p>Using the Latest Twin-Engine Aircraft: According to Dai Enji, general manager of the company, although the weather on this route is bad and there are many high mountains and steep ridges, using a twin-engine aircraft should not be a problem. The route will run from Chongqing through Guizhou to Yunnan. It is now being actively planned and it is proposed to purchase the latest type of Locke aircraft. However, repairs are slightly difficult. In addition, it is also necessary to consider the seating and fuel consumption issues, which should be taken seriously. However, a decision can be made in the short term.</p>
<p>Fujian Aircraft Completed: The Douglas new Fujian aircraft has been completed and is scheduled for a test flight in two or three days. The Shanghai-Guangdong route will be resumed as scheduled according to the regulations. Only one aircraft will be used temporarily. There is also a Douglas aircraft and a repaired Sikorsky aircraft, which will temporarily join the Shanghai-Hankou route.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Retrial of Four Kidnappers <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Witnesses Not Yet Fully Summoned</p>
<p>Four Bandits Detained Awaiting Further Trial</p>
<p>Jin Jiulin, the inspector of the special agency of the French Concession Police, etc., arrested more than a dozen kidnappers in Tianjin in July of last year, including Geng Huatang, Zheng Tangsheng, Shang Zhen, Liu Yimin, and Wu Shaoting, and transferred them to Shanghai. It was found that the criminals had previously kidnapped Huang Yuyi, the deputy director of the Zhongnan Bank, Chen Yanghe, the assistant manager of the Siming Bank, He Shaochu, the owner of the Xinsenji Construction Factory, Huang Baohua, a wealthy dye merchant, murdered a fellow gang member Xiao Shaoxing, and kidnapped Chen Zhuling and Liang Huiwu, both compradores of Jardine Matheson, in Tianjin, tearing up the tickets and burying the bodies to destroy the evidence. The police immediately telegraphed Tianjin to exhume the bodies of Chen and Liang. At the same time, the bandits were sent to the Second Special Court to be prosecuted for kidnapping. Later, the criminal Geng Huatang committed suicide in prison out of fear of punishment. Subsequently, Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Wu were sentenced to death for repeated kidnapping, and the rest were acquitted. Later, because Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Wu did not accept the original judgment, they submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for review, and the case was sent back to the Second Special Court for retrial. Wang Gangxu, the chief judge of the Criminal Division, held several hearings for investigation, but all of them were postponed because the witnesses and victims could not be summoned to court. This has been reported in previous newspapers. This case was reopened for continuation of the trial by Judge Wang the day before yesterday. Of the witnesses and victims summoned, only Huang Yuyi, Chen Yanghe, and He Shaoting appeared in court. According to Huang and Chen, they could not remember because it had been a long time. However, He Shaoting said that when he was kidnapped, the second defendant, Shang Zhen, seemed to be at the scene. He was sitting in the car, on my right hand side. At first, Shang's face was thin, but now he is fatter. When questioned, Zheng Tangsheng categorically denied being at the scene of the kidnapping or sharing the money. Shang Zhen testified that he was at home in Chuzhou at that time. After his mother died, he became a monk at the Baoben Hall on Mount Putuo and did not know about the kidnapping. The two criminals, Liu Yimin and Wu Shaoting, also denied the kidnapping. The confessions of the criminals were the same as the previous two times. As a result, the court ruled that the trial would be adjourned to a later date because the witnesses summoned were not complete. The four criminals, Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Wu, were still remanded to the detention center.</p>

<p>In the case of the 12,000 yuan robbery of the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm on the afternoon of June 9, the four suspects arrested by the French Concession Police, Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, were sued in the Second Special Court and declared innocent. Later, because the Police Department did not accept the verdict, it appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. When the collegial panel of the High Court opened a trial on the 12th of this month, Zhang Zuming did not appear due to illness, and the trial was adjourned to a later date. Zhao Shibei, the chief prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court, in order to take this case seriously, personally went to the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm for investigation, and also summoned the comprador Zhou Jinggeng to investigate. This has been reported in detail in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Third Branch of the High Court is not tired of seeking details in this case and pays special attention to it. Therefore, at 10 a.m. today, the appellants Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue will be summoned again to court for a detailed investigation. In the afternoon, they will go to the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm again to investigate the robbery situation.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Russian Rogue Frauds Money from a Fellow Countrywoman <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Location of the Incident is in the Chinese Territory</p>
<p>The First Court Can Approve the Transfer</p>
<p>Russian woman Mei Kaofu, 43 years old, recently opened a bar and dance hall at No. 366 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. The business was thriving and coveted by a fellow Russian rogue, Navik. Between the 17th and 19th of this month, he repeatedly went to Mei's place, claiming that he had a girlfriend, Sasha and her husband (also Russian),</p>
<p>It was discovered that you specialize in selling dance girls for profit, and the Russian newspaper has already published this news. He said that if he informs the Chinese authorities, the Public Security Bureau must be ordered to send detectives to arrest you. According to the law, you should be sentenced to three years in prison and the bar will be closed. Sasha and her husband know the details and will testify in court once reported, so there is no way to deny it. After hearing this, Mei knew that his purpose was to threaten and defraud money. She pretended to be frightened and asked for a way to avoid the matter. Navik was overjoyed and said that there was a way to apply to the court, but he needed 500 yuan, 350 yuan to give to his girlfriend Sasha, and 150 yuan to the Russian newspaper to prevent it from publishing the story. As a result, Mei agreed to pay 100 yuan first and agreed to meet at the Jewish Hotel at No. 250 Bazi Road at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. She secretly reported to the Hongkou Police Station and sent Russian detective Grobov to wait. She took the money to the hotel and handed it to Navik. After a while, she went out and returned with the Russian detective, and immediately arrested him. 95 yuan was found on his person, and he claimed that a small amount had been spent. His accomplice, the Russian woman Sasha, was subsequently arrested and taken to the police station separately for detention. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Court. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, gave a detailed account of the situation, and said that the victim lived in the Chinese territory, and the defendants had repeatedly contacted her there, but the location of the arrest was on Bazi Road. The Public Security Bureau requested a transfer. If there is an official letter, they agree. He presented the money to the court for inspection. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Then, the victim, Russian woman Mei Kaofu, testified about what happened. An officer from the Public Security Bureau came to court, claiming that he did not bring the official letter because of the rush. Judge Xiao Xieyun ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody separately, pending the official transfer letter.</p>

<p>Both Sides Had Bad Intentions</p>
<p>The Young Widow Fled First After Hearing the News</p>
<p>Pan Xia, a woman from Yancheng, 50 years old, lived in a thatched shed in the Xiaoyang Bridge area, west of Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. Her son, Cai Bang, had passed away, leaving behind a widowed daughter-in-law, Ye, only 19 years old, who worked in a yarn factory and earned 20 yuan a month. After her husband's death, Guan Ruqi, a well-known local man, coveted her youth and the 20 yuan she earned each month, so he often tried to seduce her. However, Ye thought that Guan's behavior was bad and glared at him, and secretly told her mother-in-law Xia not to allow Guan to enter the house. The mother's family of Pan Xia also had cousins, Xia Xiansheng and Xia Xianyou, who wanted to marry Ye. The day before yesterday, they held the "fifth seven" memorial service for Ye's late husband, inviting relatives to dinner. Unexpectedly, at about 8 p.m., the Xia family invited dozens of people to capture Ye, and Guan Ruqi also invited dozens of people to snatch Ye to be his wife. However, Ye had already heard the news, so she dug a hole next to the thatched shed and secretly escaped. For a time, the young widow's whereabouts were unknown. Guan suspected that Xia had snatched her, and Xia suspected that Guan had snatched her. They argued endlessly. The Tanziawan Police Station heard about it and sent police to arrest Guan Ruqi, Pan Xia, Xia Xiansheng, Xia Tao, and Tao Shaoqing, and sent them to the Xinzha Public Security Bureau. After questioning, the official learned the details. Because Pan Ye had not been brought to the court, he sent detective Fang Chaofu yesterday to investigate and summon Ye to the court. Ye testified that because there were many people that night, she escaped to a relative's house in Xiaoshadu to take refuge. The rest of her testimony was similar to the above. After verifying the confession, the official, considering that the case was related to the abduction of a woman, ordered that the six people, including Pan Ruqi, be sent to the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>

As they spoke, they took out a silver dollar from their person and gave it to the branch's accountant, who dispatched Cai Amao (age 36, from Tongzhou), the driver of rental permit No. 12032, to drive them. The two men boarded the car one after the other and drove straight away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu's Faith: No. 60, west of the Jiangsu Higher Third Branch on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, is the mansion of Yu Mishantang, a wealthy Guangdong merchant. Inside resides the mistress of the house, elderly Mrs. Yu, who, although over sixty years old, is energetic and devoutly Catholic. Every Sunday and holiday, she attends Mass at church without fail. She is known for her frugality, and only uses a chartered car (Municipal Permit No. 3757, Concession No. 80) when going out.</p>
<p>Kidnapped into the Car: Yesterday was Sunday. Mrs. Yu got up at 7:00 AM, washed, and after a quick breakfast, it was already 8:00 AM. She promptly boarded her chartered car. The driver, Lu Huixiang, pulled the car eastward. Just as they reached the entrance of No. 5, west of the Jiangsu Higher Third Branch, three kidnappers suddenly rushed out, each drawing a handgun, ordering the driver to stop the car. At the same time, two kidnappers forced Mrs. Yu into a pre-arranged yellow taxi parked by the roadside, and sped eastward. The license plate number of the taxi was No. 12032, the same one rented from Baker Road earlier.</p>
<p>Police Pursuit: The chartered car driver, Lu Huixiang, was stunned and frightened when he witnessed the kidnapping of his employer. After a long while, he regained his composure and hurriedly drove the empty car back home to report the incident. The family then reported it to the Loujiawan Police Station in charge. The head detective then dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives in all directions, but they were nowhere to be found. The head detective urgently notified the Public Concession and the Public Security Bureau's various sub-bureaus by telephone to intercept the vehicle, but to no avail. It wasn't until noon that the taxi was found near Gaolang Bridge on Lan Road, but it was empty. The driver, Cai Amao, was also missing at the same time.</p>
<p>Speculation: After the incident, police detectives speculated that when the two kidnappers rented the car, they said they only wanted to go to the North Mud City Bridge. At that time, Cai Amao must have driven to a place near where they said, and then lured Cai into the kidnappers' lair, where he was kept under surveillance. Then, a kidnapper who was a skilled driver drove the car to Avenue Edward VII to wait for the ransom target. Otherwise, if Cai were also in the car at the same time, he would have been pushed out of the car midway, and would not have been kidnapped as well. Others speculated that Mrs. Yu's kidnapping may involve some kind of issue, but this may be overthinking it.</p>
<p>Five Years Ago: The reporter distinctly remembers that five years ago, the mistress of the Yu Mansion at No. 43 Rue Courbet, also a Catholic, was kidnapped in front of the church on Rue de l'Eglise in the French Concession while attending Mass. She was later ransomed with a large sum of money. This time, the kidnapped person is also a woman, also surnamed Yu, and also kidnapped while attending Catholic Mass. The kidnapping location is also in the French Concession. This is truly a rare coincidence, a sight to behold. However, according to general opinion, the Mrs. Yu kidnapped five years ago is the same Mrs. Yu kidnapped today. But when the reporter inquired at the Yu residence on Rue Courbet, they absolutely denied that the two were the same person.</p>

<p>It Was Only Learned Yesterday That He Was Detained by the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>The Xianju Fellow-Townsmen Association Requests His Release</p>
<p>The Shanghai Xianju Fellow-Townsmen Association states that according to fellow-townsman Wang Huanhui, his father, Wang Shuhuai, accompanied his son to Shanghai for medical treatment and went missing. He had posted advertisements in newspapers to find him. Recently, he learned that his father was detained by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He requests a certificate for bail. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau requesting that bail be granted. The original text is as follows: "Submitting a request for a fellow-townsman to be bailed out from unjust detention. According to a letter from fellow-townsman Wang Huanhui, his father, Shuhuai, accompanied him to Shanghai for medical treatment on the 7th of this month. He has been missing since he went out on Double Tenth Day. He has inquired with relatives and friends, but has not been able to find him. He was extremely anxious and had already reported it to the Baoshan Road Public Security Sub-bureau and posted advertisements in newspapers to find him. It was only yesterday that news came that he was being detained by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. His father is an honest villager and would never have any transgressive behavior. He is in prison, and it is not known what crime he committed. We are requesting your esteemed bureau to quickly rescue him to redress his grievances." At the same time, according to a letter from Zhang Fengsu, her husband, Zheng Songnan, was also innocently detained by the Municipal Public Security Bureau (the rest is the same as the previous letter, so it is omitted). It has come to light that Wang Shuhuai is an honest elder in our hometown and would never have any misconduct. Zheng Songnan is also an honest businessman, and they are both innocent and implicated in the case. Their situation is very pitiful. We have prepared this document to request your approval to grant them bail to avoid their grievances. It would be a great act of kindness."</p>

It is said that the fire insurance covers only four or five thousand taels.</p>

<p>Extreme Joy Turns to Sorrow, Captured in Beijing</p>
<p>The Wu Changchun paper store at No. 172 Wanyu Street, Dongjiadu, outside the Small South Gate in this city, is run by Wu Genxian from Jiangxi. Wu once married and had a son and a daughter. The eldest daughter's name is Wu Qiulan, and the younger son's name is Wu Guozhu. He married Wang Aiyu, a woman from the same hometown, in the first month of the lunar calendar in 1929. The young couple had a very harmonious relationship. However, both of their two grandsons died one after another. Guozhu assisted his father in managing the store and was unhappy. Unexpectedly, on the 19th day of the first month of the lunar calendar last year, Guozhu died of illness. His father, Wu Changchun, thought that it was not a long-term solution to leave behind a young widow with no descendants. He discussed it with his wife and widowed daughter-in-law and agreed to adopt Yuan Yinzhu from Henan as an adopted son, who then served as Wang Aiyu's husband after entering the family. Wang Yinzhu also worked in the paper store. Yuan paid his adoptive father Genxian eighty yuan as a gift at the time. However, not long after, Wu Genxian disliked his adopted son and changed him to a partner, planning to remarry his widowed daughter-in-law to Pudong. Because the plan was not kept secret, Yuan and his daughter-in-law learned of it. On September 12th of this year, they took all their jewelry, clothes, and belongings, along with his eldest daughter, Wu Qiulan, and fled home to Nanjing to live. After Wu Genxian's widowed daughter-in-law, Wang Aiyu, his eldest daughter, Wu Qiulan, and Yuan Yinzhu suddenly disappeared, he immediately reported to Yi Zuanren, the chief of the first precinct and first station (now Dongjiadu Police Station) of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, accusing Yuan Yinzhu of seducing his widowed daughter-in-law and eldest daughter and instigating them to flee. He attached a list of missing items and photos of the three people, requesting that they be investigated and arrested. Chief Yi sent officers to investigate once and forwarded the report to Bureau Chief Wen Hong'en, who sent letters to various places for investigation. It is now known that the three men and women, including Wang Aiyu, have been captured by the Capital Police Station in Beijing. Bureau Chief Wen has ordered the Detective Captain Yu Ying of the bureau to send Detective Leader Wu Xiufeng and Detective Gui Guofang to Beijing yesterday to bring back the three people, including Wang, along with two suitcases.

<p>The Civilian Sanatorium at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road was founded by medical doctors Wang Peiyuan and Yang Zhongfu. It has magnificent buildings, a large scale, and serves the society with outstanding achievements. It is the only civilian sanatorium in the city. Yang Zhongfu, the director of the hospital, has always been enthusiastic about social undertakings. Recently, he has personally been hospitalized for diagnosis and treatment out of concern for the suffering of the common people, and his spirit of service is greatly admired. It has recently been learned that, in view of the increasing harm of opium and the fact that many Chinese people are anesthetized by it, the hospital has set up a separate smoking cessation department in addition to various other departments. In order to reduce the back-and-forth travel for those who want to quit, dozens of exquisitely decorated wards have been set up to help those who are determined to get rid of their bad habits within a limited number of days. Both residential and outpatient smoking cessation services are available. The fees are low, the care is comprehensive, and the number of people coming to quit smoking is endless. It is said that the hospital is having difficulty coping with the demand.</p>

<p>— Zhang Weile</p>
<p>Since the blue-eyed, blonde-haired, colorless race stepped into the ancient Eastern country with their warships and cargo, the power of cannons can certainly make you bow your head, and the flaunting of so-called material civilization will also make you succumb. As such, as long as they are blue-eyed and blonde-haired, you will be respectfully awed! As long as something comes from the homeland of the blue-eyed and blonde-haired, it is a priceless treasure! Alas! The people of the ancient Eastern country have lost their self-confidence!</p>
<p>I think that the unreasonable arrogance of the blue-eyed and blonde-haired does indeed make us feel extremely indignant, but our own lack of self-confidence is our fatal flaw! We will not concern ourselves with the coolies with low levels of knowledge who want to earn a few more dollars to maintain their livelihoods; what is most regrettable is that intellectuals and so-called upper-class people are also unable to extricate themselves, unable to find their own beliefs. Every move, if there is no precedent in the homeland of the blue-eyed and blonde-haired, is like an illegitimate child who has not been publicly recognized, and is deeply felt to be base and contemptible! As long as it is something that the homeland of the blue-eyed and blonde-haired "already has," there is no question of nobility or baseness, and it is okay to follow suit!</p>
<p>I am rambling too much; let me give two examples:</p>
<p>The so-called circus that is now popular, I think is about the same as the tricks we have always seen on the streets! However, in the past, the more noble people would not deign to look at any tricks, but now the circus has tickets costing three or four dollars each, yet carriages are like dragons and the gate is like a market. Although the circus is nothing more than some trick-playing acts, because it comes from the homeland of the blue-eyed and blonde-haired, its value suddenly increases a hundredfold.</p>
<p>Here is another example: the university students of our highest institutions of learning are knowledgeable enough, right? In the past, we all lived in some schools, and there were also cases of older students bullying new students, but this was an unconscious act by a few students with low-level interests, and most students who had a little self-respect would not bother to participate. Now it is different, because this kind of behavior has recently been confirmed to exist in the homeland of the blue-eyed and blonde-haired, where the term "dragging corpses" already exists. Thus, they drag and drag especially hard, dragging it until the news in the newspapers is full of reports, and this is enough to satisfy them! I believe that if they had not obtained the confirmation of the civilization of the blue-eyed and blonde-haired, they would not be so enthusiastic!</p>
<p>We should respectfully accept the essence of culture and civilization, but we must eliminate the dross of civilization. We can hardly avoid being indignant at the arrogance of the blue-eyed and blonde-haired, but we must maintain our self-confidence. If we blindly follow and blindly praise, I am afraid that we will never be able to escape the status of slaves in spirit, and we can only let the blue-eyed and blonde-haired people stride ahead forever!</p>
<h3 id="e160">The Past <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>The sun sets below the horizon, and the electric lights come on in the room. Ah, a yawn, and the day is over. Even if you have been sweating shirtless in the sun during the day, or wracking your brains at your desk with your sleeves rolled up, it all disappears as quickly as the sun, and is past. What remains is only the fatigue after a day of labor, etched on the face that is etched with wrinkles.</p>
<p>Although this "past" is past in time, from the perspective of the entire society, the accumulation of all energy is constantly increasing. Through the elimination and refining of time, from barbarism to civilization, from today to tomorrow, a continuous radiance shines in front of the continuous trajectory. This is development, evolution. The wheel of history, on this black earth, has carried a hope that is clearer day by day from the door of the past.</p>
<p>Believing in the hope, standing on the platform of the "present" to observe the "past," throwing all those chunks of experience into the engine of the wheel, then the sound emitted by this "past" will become an ode to tomorrow, rather than a meaningless sigh.</p>
<p>However, man is ultimately the "spirit" of all things. Whenever he encounters a setback, he will hug his knees and sit on the head of the bed, looking at the gray and dim corner, or stand with his hands behind his back under the moonlight, gazing at the distant reaches where the stars are twinkling. Then "inspiration" comes, and the game of hide-and-seek under the flower shade in childhood, or even the slap in the face from his father for playing hide-and-seek, become beautiful pictures worthy of tracing in his eyes, deeply savoring those remnants that can never be returned. But he insists on deeply savoring them, and then sighs with a frown. He drinks from a large bowl, smokes heavily, and the next day you can see his pale and gloomy face. In the blink of an eye, he is hunchbacked, his beard is disheveled, and he walks towards his grave step by step.</p>
<p>Gorky, in his works, repeatedly makes clear criticisms of these facts. In "Creatures That Once Were Men," he says: "There are often many people in the world who, by recalling the past, cause all the abilities of the present and all the hopes of the future to disappear." In "Chelkash" he also says: "Memory is the spur of the disappointed, it can give life to the stones of the past, pour honey into the poison drunk in the old days, make a person realize his wrongdoings, make him love the past, and deprive him of hope for the future."</p>
<p>"The past," for an individual, should be thrown away like a rotten apple by the side of your road, and you should not look back.</p>

<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>In the spring of the year I was fifteen, when people were beginning to work hard for silkworms, an elderly uncle from a distant family fell ill, and my eldest aunt ran back to my house. With my mother's consent, she took me back to her small house to help her manage the household affairs.</p>
<p>I didn't know much about my eldest aunt and uncle in detail, but one thing I was very clear about: they had always lived in quarrels. Whenever they met, they would quarrel. When they were apart, they worked hard. Comfortable laughter could never be found between them. I often wondered, what force would bind them together to live for decades?</p>
<p>My aunt was completely a heartless fellow. In the twenty-odd days I lived there, she never stopped cursing him. It was as if she didn't even have a shred of pity.</p>
<p>It was on the night my uncle died that I understood my uncle and aunt. After that, the shadows of the two of them often appeared in my mind.</p>
<p>"You should still get up."</p>
<p>I, who was sleeping on the bamboo kang wrapped in a quilt, was ordered. Following a low and resolute voice, "It's almost over."</p>
<p>I struggled to open my eyes, searching for the small kerosene lamp in the dark house. It was guiding my aunt, who had half of her hair gone and was a little hunched over, as she groped around the house.</p>
<p>The slow groans of the seriously ill and the rustling sound of silkworm larvae eating occupied this surrounding area that seemed to be the boundary between humans and ghosts.</p>
<p>In the corner of the room, under the shrine, my short uncle was lying on two thin wooden boards. His originally round face looked as if someone had dug out all the muscles; a pair of sunken, dull eyes, matched with a nose that only had two holes left and a mouth whose upper lip had already shrunk, and the windpipe was like a broken pump, with air entering and exiting with difficulty. And, clearly, he exhaled for twice as long as he inhaled. My aunt stood in front of the bed, holding a lamp, and said with her often watery eyes, "It's almost over." Then she pulled the cotton quilt, which was as dark as the sky, toward my uncle's neck. "You keep an eye out for a while. I'm going to feed the silkworms."</p>
<p>I pretended not to hear her instructions, jumped and hid behind her, holding tightly to a corner of her clothes. This rash action gave my aunt a chance to vent her frustration.</p>
<p>"Useless fellow, I was already married when I was as old as you. What are you afraid of? People are going to die eventually." She said in a rough voice, probably afraid of offending me, so she explained to me again, "You need to know, the land has always been the same size from ancient times to the present. If no one died, then, think about it, wouldn't people have to fight for places to live? And there's another thing: the money in the world is also limited. So—" She grabbed a handful of chopped mulberry leaves and carefully placed them in the silkworm nest (note). "So, people are cruel things. They abandon or even harm their own kind for money. Don't you see? The richer people are, the more cruel they are. Then, think about it, what kind of world is this? How can someone as timid as you avoid being bullied?"</p>
<p>She lowered her head very low, gently stroking the silkworm nests with great force, sometimes even putting her ear on the basket, as if whispering to them, serving one nest after another. Her attitude of being so careful with the silkworms when someone so close was about to die made me very strange and angry.</p>
<p>Usually, my uncle would say to her in such a tone:</p>
<p>"Where have I let you down? I always do things first. A seventy-year-old man still runs up to the mulberry dikes to water them every day... Where have I let you down, except for being poor?" My uncle, who was a head shorter than my aunt, would always bend over from his back to his head, and continued this posture for a long time.</p>
<p>When she heard "Why don't you drink your wine?" or "The silkworm moths are calling you," my aunt would speak in a less rough voice, but her expression would become even more depressed. If she drank a little too much wine, she would start cursing incessantly like a madwoman, until my uncle picked up the water jug or mulberry basket and went out, and then she would give a meaningless, silly laugh and sing her wedding song to me:</p>
<p>"Olives are green and tender and ready to be picked, alas, what is it that my parents didn't care about their young daughter suffering so much? I became a daughter-in-law when I was fifteen, alas,</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>………………"</p>
<p>Then, she would excitedly make gestures and tell how on the first night of her marriage, she pushed my uncle to the ground with one hand, and later, his docile, sheep-like, unresisting attitude annoyed her so much that she couldn't sleep all night. From the next day on, she began to scold him.</p>
<p>"I've been scolding him from the time he was twenty-nine until now, when he's almost seventy. That poor, stupid pig!" she said very regretfully.</p>
<p>Note: Made of bamboo strips woven into a circle, like a tabletop, with raised edges around it, commonly called a nest basket. Silkworm farmers often use them to raise silkworms and is simply called a silkworm nest.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Foreign Dusk <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Kai</p>
<p>I sit on the stool by the window, staring blankly at the sky, ah! This foreign dusk stirs up endless melancholy in me. I fantasize that my life is just like the faint glow of the setting sun, which has been defeated by the god of night. Even if I muster all my courage again, I still cannot break through this layer of obscurity. My lost youth has no possibility of lingering. I once carried a piece of fervent hope before I started wandering, but now! All hopes have turned into bubbles! Slowly, like withered roses, there is no time to flourish again, and even like the firm ice accumulated on the mountain peaks for decades, waiting to melt, alas! The belt of life tightly ties my body and mind. I have sold my labor at a meager price! Freedom! My blood is still boiling, but reality has triumphed over all hopes. Is there a glimmer of light? Far away, a cry of "Paris-Soir" awakens me from my confusion. I stand up and face the round mirror on the table. I see two hot tears streaming down my haggard face.</p>

<p>— Written by Langston Hughes, Translated by Fulan</p>
<p>Christmas arrived, and Cindy sent a large box of drugstore candies to her mother in Darside. He initially wanted to spend fifteen cents on a pair of long, cyan earrings for Grandma Hager, but he feared she wouldn't like them, so he bought her white handkerchiefs. He also sent a beautiful card to Black Reed, his aunt, because one snowy October day, his aunt saw him sweeping the reception room from outside the window, and she called him outside to talk to her. She put a small slip of paper with her new address on it in his hand.</p>
<p>"Matelee has moved to Kansas City," she said, "so I no longer live there. Keep this address safe, so you know where I am whenever Mama needs me."</p>
<p>Then she left in the snow, looking beautiful in her cheap leather coat, black high-heeled shoes, and cyan stockings. Cindy had often seen her passing the hotel entrance with different men, sometimes with the owner of the Cashman Casino, or Billy Sanderly, but almost always with vulgar-looking men wearing round felt hats and gold teeth. Cindy remembered that she didn't tell him the street number of her new house. He put the piece of paper in his pocket and went back to sweeping. Yes, he was happy to see his aunt, Black Reed.</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon, several white men sat in the reception room smoking and reading newspapers. Cindy wiped the chairs, dusted them, and then took the spittoons to clean. This work didn't require much attention, and he could use a soft cloth to wipe them. He could let his mind think of other things. He thought of Black Reed, then of school and what he should do when he grew up; he thought of Hailey May, the little girl next door who had gotten a job washing dishes for white people; he thought of Jamie Lynn, the little boy next door who had no mother; Cindy also wondered what his parents were doing in another city, or if they needed him to be with them. He also thought about how old and frail Grandma Hager had become, with her white hair, how she was now panting over the laundry tub but never complaining; how she waited for him every Saturday, leaving the kitchen stove fire on so he could warm up after walking such a long way in the cold, and how she hoped he would one day become a great man... Sitting in the back room of this hotel, Cindy often wondered how people could become great. At that time, he made the spittoons shiny and beautiful. He often thought about how people could be great.</p>
<p>Tonight, he had to pick up newspapers in the reception room, run errands for the head waiter, and shine shoes. He would have to work very late. After he put away the spittoons, he fixed himself a small meat sandwich and a cup of coffee for dinner, and then he would go back to help Charlie, if he could... Charlie was really a good old boy. He had given Cindy one dollar just for doing his job, and often helped him with small accounts, let Cindy go to the telegraph office, or do some other small improper things for the guests upstairs... Really, Charlie was a kind and interesting person.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of China (the previous preparatory office with a director system was changed to a president system, with Chiang Kai-shek as the formal president and He Yingqin and Dai Fuxian as vice presidents), it was decided to start operations on November 1st. The preparatory office originally located in the Lizhi Society was handed over, and the new headquarters was temporarily moved to the private residence rented by Minister of Transportation Zhu Gaichi in the Gaojia Hotel. (Because Zhu's Ministry of Transportation of the Compassionate Society moved, his private residence also moved.) After raising funds to build a clubhouse, they will consider moving again.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education is sponsoring the 23rd National Vocational School and Elementary School Labor Course Achievement Exhibition, which is scheduled to be held in Beijing on December 1st. The Ministry of Education has successively sent members Zhong Daozan, Tang Xifen, Gu Zhaolin, Zhou Bangdao, Dai Yingguan, Zhong Lingxiu, Xu Yiqiao, Yu Dehui, Wu Yanin, Li Jiaxiang, and others to prepare for the event. The deadline for submissions is the end of October. It is heard that the current submissions include Suiyuan (one box), Yunnan (three boxes), Guangxi (three boxes), and Weihaiwei (one box), totaling more than 800 items. In addition, more than ten provinces and cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, have reported that they have submissions. Except for provinces such as Xinjiang, which have no submissions due to the lack of vocational schools, there are submissions from more than twenty provinces and cities. Several thousand items from the reported provinces and cities are on their way. It is feared that the examination hall will also be needed by the Examination Yuan at that time, so negotiations are underway to borrow the empty house (Compassionate Society) moved out by the Ministry of Transportation as the venue.</p>

<p>Luodian County Luoyang Elementary School has been established for many years and has achieved excellent results. In addition to commuting students, there are also 19 boarders. This summer, Zhu Xin took over as principal not long ago, and there was a rampant act of teachers beating elementary school students. On the evening of the 9th, Zhao Zhengqin, an educator at the school, instructed the cook to prepare several dishes for use. At dinner time, the educators were all drinking outside. When they returned to the school late at night, they were all drunk. Suddenly, they found that the dishes had not been prepared, suspected that the boarding students had stolen the food, and then used their drunkenness to interrogate the boarding students one by one. The students' cries reached the outdoors. Afterwards, the students' families questioned the school, and although they were relieved in many ways, no incidents occurred, but a majority of them had withdrawn from school.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Answering Mr. Liu Yizheng on "Wonderful Trick to Protect the Nose" (2) Zhu Yixin <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The troops continued to advance, and when they arrived at a place, many farmers were building walls by the fields. The officer asked them, "What are you building walls for?" The farmers replied, "The seedlings in the fields are about to ripen, and we are afraid that the birds will peck at the grains, so we built walls to defend them." The officer couldn't help but laugh and said, "Silly slaves, no matter how high you build the wall, the birds will fly down from above." The farmers continued to work as if they hadn't heard the officer's words.</p>
<p>The troops entered the city and encountered a person carrying a door panel, panting and walking towards them. The officer scolded, "What are you carrying the door panel for?" The man said, "I am going to a distant place. I have money hidden at home and I am afraid that thieves will steal it. I carried the door panel out, so the thieves cannot open the door and enter." The officer snorted and said, "You fool, if you leave the door at home and carry the money with you, wouldn't it be safer?" The man shook his head and just chuckled as he walked forward.</p>
<p>The officer led the troops along the street and saw that the people in the city were acting very foolishly. He said to the soldiers, "The people here are extremely foolish. If we punish fools, it would be embarrassing. We should report to the king and then decide on a solution." After speaking, he led the troops back to the palace and reported the situation he had seen to the king.</p>
<p>After hearing the officer's words, the king immediately pardoned the people of the entire city and did not cut off their noses.</p>
<p>After the publication of this book, Mr. Liu Yizheng criticized the above text, saying, "Should the king be learned? Should nose cutting be learned? Should the masses making it impossible for the king to enter the city be learned? Should pretending to be a fool to protect the nose be learned? Should scolding people as silly slaves be learned? Should the officer's reprimand be learned? Should the king's being deceived and pardoning the nose cutters be learned? I think not only the cruel things like nose cutting should not be told to children, but also the tone of scolding people should not be included in the science textbooks." (See Guofeng, Volume 5, Issue 1, and Jiangsu Education, National Language Education Special Issue, "Questions on National Language Teaching Materials.")</p>
<p>From this passage, it can be seen that Mr. Liu's insights are threefold: first, there are many things in "Wonderful Trick to Protect the Nose" that should not be learned; second, cruel things like nose cutting should not be told to children; and third, there should be no scolding tones in textbooks.</p>
<p>I will now reply to Mr. Liu:</p>
<p>(1) Learning is a kind of stimulus, and the reaction caused by the stimulus is nothing more than two kinds: one is to learn from good, and the other is to abandon evil. Learning from good is imitation, which is learning; abandoning evil is a warning, which is not learning. Teaching materials have both positive and negative aspects. Positive teaching materials stimulate children to do good, while negative teaching materials stimulate children to abandon evil. Although the paths are different, the purpose of education can be achieved in the same way. We know that the task of reading education in the national language subject is to cultivate reading ability and interest as the primary purpose. Moral training is, of course, not as strong as in civics and society, but the text "Wonderful Trick to Protect the Nose" also contains two levels of positive and negative effects. Mr. Liu poses several questions, meaning that he fears that children will learn bad things after reading it. In fact, from a negative perspective, children will definitely not learn from the king after reading it, even without discussion, because they know that the king's tyranny is a bad thing; they will definitely not learn to cut noses, because they know that cutting noses is a bad thing; they will definitely not learn to scold people as silly slaves; they will definitely not learn to reprimand, because they know that scolding and reprimanding are bad things. These four reactions of thinking that bad things should not be learned do not need any external evidence. Please ask yourself, Mr. Liu, whether you have this feeling after reading this lesson's text, or please ask children these questions to see if the children answer that they should not be learned. From a positive perspective, "the masses making it impossible for the king to enter the city" is because of resisting the king's harassment. Since the king cannot protect the people, the people will naturally rise up to resist. "Pretending to be a fool to protect the nose" is because of preventing the king's tyranny. Since the king is tyrannical, the people, in a position of powerlessness and courage, will naturally design to get rid of the tragedy of nose cutting. As a result, the king is deceived (it is a design to avoid disaster, not deception), and pardoning the nose cutters is the success of the people's design. We can use Dr. Sun Yat-sen's historical facts as proof for this example. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was engaged in revolution, resisting tyranny, for forty years as one day. In the middle, he did not hesitate to disguise and change his name in order to save his useful body and serve the country. It can be seen that reasonable resistance and situational adaptation are not things that cannot be learned. In short, positive teaching materials naturally account for the majority of a book, but adding some negative teaching materials with humor (this lesson's text, according to the curriculum standards, is literary in content and a joke or legend in form, and does not take moral training as the greatest goal) and containing the intention of abandoning evil, in order to change the children's daily taste for learning positive teaching materials, does not go against the principles of learning, and moreover, it also contains a positive effect.</p>
<p>(2) The forms of human society, "right" and "wrong," "good" and "evil," are relative. Since we have no way to make society all "right" and "good," how can children not know about "wrong" and "evil," making them become a first-class figure of "why not eat meat porridge" in the future, stepping into society to be a superman who knows "good" and "right" but does not know "evil" and does not know "wrong?" Cutting off noses is indeed an inhumane barbaric act, but records in Chinese and foreign history show that humans have indeed done such things. Even in today's civilization, our revolutionary martyr Cai Gongshi could not avoid having his nose cut off and his eyes gouged out by the brutal Japanese soldiers. Could it be that the tragic killing of Cai Gongshi by the Japanese soldiers will also be kept from children because of its cruelty? It should be known that the distinction between "good," "evil," "right," and "wrong" cannot be made clear without comparison. Knowing "good" to imitate, knowing "evil" to understand the warning, is really the same need in education.</p>
<p>(3) "Silly slave" and "reprimand" are both bad nouns, but there are indeed "silly slaves" in society, and there is indeed "reprimand" in human speech. If these words are not allowed for children to learn, then what will they think if they encounter others calling them "silly slaves" or "reprimanding" them? We have no practical way to make society have no "silly slaves" and no sounds of "reprimand." We also have no way to eliminate words such as "silly slave" and "reprimand" in the dictionary. Then, carefully not letting children know words such as "silly slave" and "reprimand" is not deceiving children?</p>
<p>In all fairness, the reason why high school national language teaching materials do not avoid jokes and legends is because these teaching materials, on the one hand, can meet the learning interests of children, and on the other hand, can cultivate children's reading ability. They do not violate and conform to the main purpose of national language teaching. Even if we take a step back and speculate on Mr. Liu's meaning, thinking that national language teaching materials must be conditioned on moral cultivation in every article, then, as mentioned above, "Wonderful Trick to Protect the Nose" does not go against the conditions of moral cultivation and has its own value to read. If we take only a part and use one or two nouns as criticism, we will lose the true attitude of scholars' comments. Mr. Liu has compiled and selected the Zhongshan National Language Reader for high schools. I randomly flipped through a few articles and found phrases such as "dismembered by five horses," "and even thought to restore corporal punishment," "although eating the flesh of the commentators does not help the people" (see Su Shi's Letter to Emperor Shenzong in the second volume), "cooking the talkers," "children are not enough to conspire with," "King Xiang glared at them" (see Historical Records of Xiang Yu in the second volume), and other words and sentences. If I criticize Mr. Liu by saying, "Not only the cruel things such as 'dismemberment by five horses,' 'corporal punishment,' 'eating human flesh,' and 'cooking' should not be told to students, but also the tone of scolding people and the strict words and colors should not be included in textbooks," wouldn't Mr. Liu burst out laughing?</p>
<p>The reply ends here. I hope that Mr. Liu and those who have a research interest in national language teaching can give their advice. (End)</p>

<p>丨Result: Three to One丨</p>
<p>Tung Wah Wins with Balanced Performance</p>
<p>Yu You and Tung Wah, known as the two giants of Shanghai football, met at Shen Garden yesterday at 3 PM for a match in the Western League A Division. Considering the past performance of the two teams and their current talent, the attraction for the audience was undoubtedly amazing. Nearly 8,000 spectators were seated around the field, which was the expected turnout. Under tense circumstances, both sides frequently committed fouls, which was a flaw. Each side dominated for 45 minutes in each half. Tung Wah scored three goals in the first half, and Yu You scored one goal in the second half. The referee, Shen Huichun, handled the situation appropriately, so all parties were able to maintain peace.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Team:</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen, Li Ning, Chen Gong, Gu Shang, Feng Yunyou, Chen Hongguang, Cao Qiuting, Li Yichen, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Yu You Team:</p>
<p>Xu Heng, Wang Shusen, Jiang Shanjing, Liang Shutang, Chen Zhenxiang, Yun Feng, Fu Hexuan, Sun Jinshun, Luo Haiguang, Zhong Yuxiang, Zhong Yongshen</p>
<p>Too Much Pressure Among Family Members: Although the talents of the two teams are not all at their peak, they can be considered excellent. Some have attended the Far Eastern Games, and others have dominated Shanghai. Ordinary players are not on the field. They can be considered representative figures in today's Shanghai Chinese football scene, worthy of the title of heroes. However, the distinction between us and them is too strong, and the desire to win is even deeper. As a result, the artistic performance is diminished, and the focus shifts to defending against each other. Several times, fierce actions occurred, but they were still able to maintain the overall situation and end without incident. In the end, they are all family members, so why put so much pressure on each other?</p>
<p>Obvious Differences in Strength: Tung Wah benefited from balanced performance between the front and back lines, and the forwards cooperated more closely. Yu You's internal resistance was strong, but the forward attacks were slightly weaker. The two sides had the same opportunities, and the difference in victory and defeat was due to this. Speaking individually, the goalkeeper Xu Heng is still commendable. The inner guards were equally skilled. Chen Zhenxiang and Feng Yunyou in the center back line can be called comparable. The left and right supports were more solid for Tung Wah. Zhong Yongshen was the most effective among Yu You's five forwards. Sun Jin and Gu were under surveillance. Luo Haiguang was not used at the right time. Zhong Yuxiang could dribble but was not good at shooting. Fu Hexuan contributed very little. Tung Wah's two wings were more active. Li Yichen was competent, Chen Jiaqiu was steady, and Dai Linjing was clever. Therefore,</p>
<p>Tung Wah Scores in Seven Minutes: Not long after Yu You kicked off, they were attacked by Tung Wah. Jia Youliang passed to the central area. Xu Heng met and caught the ball. Fu Hexuan was ordered to counterattack. Gu Shang intercepted and passed to Dai Linjing. Jiang Shanjing chased after him quickly. The ball went from the end line to the central area. Yu You's goalkeeper and inner guards were paying attention to the left side and were caught off guard. Cao Qiuting had been waiting for a long time and kicked the ball into the goal, only seven minutes into the game, which was surprising.</p>
<p>Good Opportunities Misused: Once the victory and defeat were determined, the situation gradually worsened, and chaos occurred at any time. Fortunately, they managed to maintain the situation. Zhong Yongshen made two successful challenges at this time, causing some anxiety for Tung Wah, but they were able to turn the crisis into safety with tight defense. Jiang Shanjing also went to the enemy's position and shot, but the shot was too high, and Lu Zhongen caught it easily. Tung Wah suddenly changed tactics, switching from short passes to long passes. After three or four rotations, the ball was at Jia's feet. The goal was in sight, but he was too hasty and kicked it at an angle, allowing Yu You to invade again. Before long, the area within ten feet of Tung Wah's goal became a melee zone for both sides. Initially, it was caused by Zhong Yongshen's excellent corner kick, and the ball even hit the goalpost but did not go in. Yu You missed this good opportunity, causing the audience to regret it.</p>
<p>Yu You Loses Consecutive Goals Under Pressure: Tung Wah's crisis had just passed, and the morale of the army was boosted. Center forward Dai urged the troops to break into the enemy's position. Dust flew up, and Li Yichen was seen rushing in, but Jiang Shanjing could not stop him. He went to the front of the goal, and Xu Heng, who was always alert, could not stop him from entering. Tung Wah won the goal. After Tung Wah scored, Chen Hongguang committed a foul and was penalized. Sun Jinshun took a shot from 25 yards away from the goal. The ball was fast and low, but Lu had prepared early and caught it. The forwards surrounded the area but retreated without success. Dai and Li then advanced again. Cao Qiuting responded on the left. In an instant, Li Yichen shot suddenly, hitting Jiang's back squarely, and the ball bounced into the net. Xu Heng was unable to turn the tide. In the first half, Tung Wah scored three goals.</p>
<p>Regains One Goal in Revival: In the second half, Yu You's lineup was more organized and had a sense of revival. Sun Jinshun and Luo Haiguang shot one after another, but their ambitions were not realized. They were in a superior position but were repeatedly shut out because they did not shoot properly. Ten minutes into the second half, Chen Zhenxiang assisted in the central area, and Sun Jinshun used all his strength to score into the net, making it three to one. Later, Zhong Yongshen passed the ball into the center, but Luo and Fu lost their footing one after another. Zhong tried again, but Chen was slow and did not succeed. At that time, Chen Gong, Jiang Shanjing, Cao Qiuting and others were injured one after another, went out and came back in. Yu You had more opportunities to get the ball, but they could not reverse the situation because their forwards were not as good as the opponents. As a result, Tung Wah won three to one.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Jiangxi Women's Sports Meet Ends in Wind and Rain <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>One Central China Record Broken</p>
<p>Five Provincial Records Broken</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) The first Jiangxi Women's Sports Meet concluded on the 16th, which was the final day of the competition. On that day, the wind and rain were mixed, even worse than yesterday. Most people thought it would be postponed, but the athletes still arrived on time in the wind and rain. Although the weather was as cold as winter, everyone was in high spirits and fought fiercely. Compared to the seemingly weak young ladies, it was like heaven and earth. The whole day was for ball games. In volleyball, the girls' middle school team played against Baoling, and Baoling won overwhelmingly with a score of 21 to 12. In basketball, the women's vocational school team played against the midwifery school team. The midwifery school team was very weak and lost badly with a score of 4 to 49. When the ball games were over, Chen Mengyu, the principal of the Shanghai Dongya Sports Academy, assigned male students who graduated in Jiangxi to form groups with the female team members who came to Jiangxi for performances. The result was a tie with a score of 10 to 10. After the two teams finished performing, the Dongya team played another performance against the provincial basketball champion team (women's vocational school team). The women's vocational school team was obviously no match for them and lost miserably with a score of 3 to 29. However, this was expected. It was just "seeking advice."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dongya team finished its performances in Jiangxi, and Qian Hangsu and 14 others returned to Shanghai on the 17th, led by Principal Chen. It is said that Anhui has also sent a letter inviting them to participate in performances, but it is unknown whether it will become a reality.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Second Day <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The city was full of wind and rain near Chongyang. On this day, the north wind roared and drizzle fell. The audience in the public sports field was sparse, huddled up and shivering, while a group of athletes still wore short sleeves and shorts, fighting against the cold wind and rain. Around 9 o'clock, the sports events started, and the results were much better than last year. One Central China record was broken, and five provincial records were broken. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Long Jump Breaks Central China Record: Tan Caiyun is a high-achieving student at the women's vocational school and has a considerable position in women's sports in the province. This time, she broke the previous Central China Games record in the long jump with a distance of 4.13 meters.</p>
<p>Five Provincial Records Broken: (1) In the Group B field events, Cheng Maolan threw the shot put 7.85 meters and the javelin 17.58 meters. (2) In the track events, Li Xiuqin broke the provincial record in the 50-meter dash with 8 seconds. Tan Caiyun set a new provincial record with 7.9 seconds. Tan Caiyun also broke the provincial record in the 100-meter dash with 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Shanghai Stars Give Wonderful Performances: Qian Hangsu is a short-distance running star, and the 100-meter dash is his specialty. He was the focus of everyone's attention. At the sound of the gun, Qian shot like an arrow and reached the finish line in 14 seconds. Wang Changhua, a member of the Dongya team, performed the high jump. He jumped one meter effortlessly. Finally, he jumped 1.29 meters. The 400-meter relay race was also performed by Qian Hangsu, Xu Yuan, Wang Changhua, and Chen Shuqing from the Dongya team. They struggled against the wind and rain and still maintained the national record.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Opening Highlights <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The first Jiangxi Provincial Women's Sports Meet was opened at the provincial sports field at 9 a.m. yesterday (the 14th). However, the north wind was strong and dust filled the sky, which reduced the excitement. No less than 2,000 students from various girls' middle schools in Nanchang participated. Qian Hangsu and her group of 14 athletes from Shanghai also attended. There were thousands of guests and spectators from all walks of life. The audience on both sides of the rostrum was packed, making it an unprecedentedly lively event. The highlights of the day at the venue are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Venue Is Like Martial Law: In addition to the social boy scouts maintaining order at the venue, a team each of police, military police, security guards, and soldiers were responsible for guarding the venue. Therefore, there were layers of boy scouts, military police, police, and security guards guarding the entrances and exits of the venue, as if under special martial law. The spectators around were all surprised and whispered about it. Some joked that the organizing committee of the games was so careful in order to protect Miss Qian from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Everyone Is Looking for Miss Qian: The spectators at the venue all wanted to see Miss Qian. Therefore, the sound of "Which one is Miss Qian?" could be heard everywhere. Later, after the opening ceremony, reporters at the venue rushed to the rostrum to surround Miss Qian and take pictures. The audience's attention was focused on the rostrum, and they saw Miss Qian shyly answering in the midst of an onslaught of hand-held cameras.</p>
<p>Stars Display Their Calligraphy on the Spot: The day before the games, Jiangxi Minbao planned to publish a special edition for the Provincial Women's Sports Meet and asked Miss Qian to write a message in her own handwriting. Her calligraphy was delicate and beautiful. Therefore, guests and reporters from various newspapers at the venue also asked for her calligraphy. Miss Qian was generous and composedly wielded her brush at the venue, signing her name or writing inscriptions as requested.</p>
<p>The Chairman调酒水车 Distributes Water: On that day, the wind was strong and the venue was filled with sand, which made people feel disoriented. The chairman of the games, the Director of the Department of Education, Cheng Shizhuo, recognizing this, immediately asked the Municipal Committee to borrow a洒水马车 water truck after the opening ceremony to drive around the venue and moisten the soil. However, the north wind was too strong, so the effect was minimal.</p>
<p>Photographers Were Busy Taking Pictures: The Political Training Office of the 行营 Military Headquarters believed that the Nanchang Women's Sports Meet was an unprecedented and significant event. Therefore, they also came to the venue to film the event from beginning to end, keeping a group of photographers very busy. (October 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e197">On the Pathology of Protozoa (1) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yanggao</p>
<p>In the universe, in addition to the animals, plants, and minerals that we can see with the naked eye, there is another world, most of which cannot be observed without a microscope. The protozoa I want to talk about today belongs to this world. When you hear this term, you may think about what these animals look like. This is what I can guess. Originally, the organization of these animals is very simple. Not to mention that they have no head or tail, the structure of their whole body consists of only one cell. Therefore, they also belong to the category of so-called "unicellular organisms." "Organism" is a "living" thing, so how do they live? Can they eat? Breathe? Move? Reproduce? Of course, they can. Then, it is a bit doubtful. Can one cell have such great functions? Although we humans are the most evolved animals, we cannot find a cell in the human body that has so many physiological functions. This is not a good thing to say. Although a single cell is like this compared to a single cell, our human body organization has a large number, so there is a kind of collective structure (organ). A person is formed by integrating many organs to cooperate. Each organ's cell has its own specialized skills, just like a carpenter can only make tables and chairs, because he has not learned to be a blacksmith since he was young and cannot make knives. Besides, we already have a blacksmith in our body. But then again, we cannot help but wonder how one cell of the protozoa has so many physiological abilities.</p>
<p>Today, let's first look at the cell's organization, which is similar to that of other animals: (1) protoplasm, (2) cell nucleus. The texture of the protoplasm is a kind of gelatinous substance, between liquid and solid. Therefore, when this protozoa is still, it looks like a drop of glue and is perfectly round. As for its composition, it also contains proteins, fats, and lipids, etc. In addition, there are undigested foods and air bubbles, etc. that they take from the outside. This gelatinous substance is affected by air in the layer connected to the air, so it is relatively solidified and viscous, and it becomes a skin-like thing. The texture of this cell skin toward the inside gradually becomes thinner. When we observe its shape with a microscope, the protoplasm mostly looks like a honeycomb. A more important cell component than protoplasm is the cell nucleus. If we compare the cell nucleus to the nucleus in a fruit, then the flesh outside the fruit is like the protoplasm of the cell. The nucleus of the fruit is often more important than the outer flesh. The main ability to pass on genes is hidden in the nucleus. This goes without saying, everyone knows it. We must know that the nucleus of our protozoa is also exactly like this. Originally, the physiological work of reproduction and heredity of protozoa is entirely dependent on its nucleus to control everything. We only need to reveal the function of the nucleus of the simplest protozoa, and then we will know how one protozoa can become two. First, the cell nucleus must be divided into two parts, and then the protoplasm will also be divided into two. So the main leadership work is in the hands of the nucleus. The inside of the nucleus originally contains two kinds of substances, one is the genetic substance, and the other is the motor substance. This motor substance first regularly distributes its own mass inside the nucleus, with two ends like two poles, and the middle like a magnetic field. It is really like the pattern of iron filings controlled by the force of a magnet. The genetic substance gathers on the equator of this magnetic field. With the force in this field, it gradually divides the entire mass evenly into two parts, one part goes to the anode, and the other part goes to the cathode, gathering around the two poles. When this time comes, the responsibility of the motor substance is considered complete. Therefore, it also divides itself into two parts, and the genetic substances attached to the two ends separate, until the nucleus has completed this set of work, then the protoplasm is divided into two, becoming two protozoa. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Attitude a Judge Should Have When Handling Medical Malpractice Cases <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>In recent years, medical malpractice disputes have emerged endlessly, and it is not uncommon for doctors and patients to meet in court. Medical professionals often, in addition to defending themselves in court, submit all the facts to formal medical organizations for a fair judgment. When medical organizations accept such cases, they base their decisions on the pleadings of both the plaintiff and the defendant, and also conduct on-site investigations. Then, they report the conclusions reached from a scholarly and factual perspective to the court for the judge's reference in making a judgment. The intention is good. However, according to reports from some accused doctors recently, a few judges disregard these documents that uphold justice. Their judgments are still based on subjective arbitrariness. At first, I was puzzled, then I thought about it, and then I realized that the judge's arbitrariness is not without reason. Please allow me to briefly state the reasons.</p>
<p>Medicine is the most profound science. When a doctor treats a patient, and unfortunately the patient dies, whether the cause is due to the incurable nature of the disease or the doctor's misdiagnosis, only those who are deeply knowledgeable in medicine can know. Judges in the court are undoubtedly well-versed in the law, but in medicine, they are laymen, no different from ordinary people. At this time, if a formal medical organization provides an expert report based on scholarly and factual assessments for reference, the help it provides to the judge's judgment is self-evident. As the saying goes: "Determine the crime based on the facts." This means that the law is merely a written document and depends on the user. One must conduct a detailed investigation beyond the law. Therefore, in medical malpractice cases, the expert reports from medical organizations have extremely significant reference value in making a judgment. If a judge suspects that this is a biased defense of colleagues and disregards it, relying only on simple legal clauses and the one-sided complaints of the patient's family, then the result of the judgment, even if one does not want it to deviate from the facts and medical science, how can it be avoided? This is one reason.</p>
<p>When people are in a state of great anger or extreme sorrow, their words are often biased and lose balance. Those who speak may be driven by momentary emotions, but those who listen must calm their minds and quiet their emotions to seek the true facts. Otherwise, few can avoid being moved and losing balance as a result. Law is what maintains justice. Therefore, the character for "law" (法) contains the element of "water" (水), which symbolizes fairness. It means that those who uphold the law must have a mind as calm as water before they can fully handle the task of hearing cases. Nowadays, the complaints of patients' families accusing doctors are undoubtedly filled with poignant and touching words. If the judge is unconsciously moved by their words, then they will first have sympathy for the patient's family, and naturally have dissatisfaction with the doctor. With sympathy and dissatisfaction arising in the mind, it is no wonder that the judgment cannot be fair. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>In today's Chinese society, the general public often harbors feelings of jealousy towards doctors. When a doctor has an accident, many people secretly rejoice, even if they do not say so. However, while this is not blameworthy in others, it is absolutely unacceptable in a judge. A judge must maintain a completely independent and impartial spirit in order to achieve the goal of great justice and impartiality. If their mindset fails to distinguish itself from the common customs, then their judgment will be no different from placing themselves in the position of the general public. This explains why a certain judge, when interrogating a certain doctor, said, "You doctors caused someone's death and still want to argue?" Using emotions and easily expressing sympathy for the patient's family or the general public is the same as being biased and detrimental to utmost fairness. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>Based on the above three points, one can understand that the judge's arbitrariness is not without reason. In order to maintain justice and protect the medical profession, we request the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the highest judicial organs, to instruct courts in various regions to seek the opinions of formal medical organizations as a basis before announcing judgments in cases involving medical malpractice disputes in the future. As for the judges themselves, they should maintain an attitude of impartiality and fairness and should not easily express sympathy for any party. In this way, the unjust cases in the medical field can be eliminated, and the law itself will further increase its sanctity. This is not only fortunate for the medical field, but also for justice.</p>

<p>(Question) What is stomach cancer?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is a disease in which cancer occurs in the stomach. It is most common in the elderly, around the age of forty or fifty. Stomach cancer is very common.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the causes of stomach cancer?</p>
<p>(Answer) The causes of stomach cancer are mostly related to hereditary factors. It can also develop from the scars of healed gastric ulcers. In families with stomach cancer, the disease is often passed down through generations.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the initial symptoms of stomach cancer?</p>
<p>(Answer) In the early stages, most people have no symptoms. There are only mild symptoms of indigestion, such as loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, heaviness in the stomach, belching, and constipation. However, when there is a sudden loss of weight, weakness (cachexia), and anemia, stomach cancer should be suspected.</p>
<p>(Question) Are there changes in digestion after stomach cancer develops?</p>
<p>(Answer) Generally, it is like ordinary indigestion, with a coated tongue, complaints of thirst, and decreased appetite, especially an aversion to meat. After eating, there is a feeling of pressure and fullness in the stomach, sometimes with persistent stomach pain. There is abnormal fermentation in the stomach, often with belching and frequent vomiting.</p>
<p>(Question) What other symptoms are there of stomach cancer?</p>
<p>(Answer) Bleeding in the stomach is another symptom of stomach cancer. However, the amount of bleeding is small, and occult blood must be found in the vomit and feces.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>(Question) Can stomach cancer spread to other organs?</p>
<p>(Answer) Stomach cancer can easily spread to other organs. The most common is metastasis to the liver. In addition, it can spread to the supraclavicular lymph nodes on the left side, peritoneum, omentum, abdominal lymph nodes, lungs, spine, bones, brain, ovaries, navel, etc.</p>
<p>(Question) Is there a specific location in the stomach where stomach cancer occurs?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is not fixed. Some occur in the cardia, some in the pylorus, and some in the gastric body.</p>
<p>(Question) How should stomach cancer be diagnosed?</p>
<p>(Answer) Diagnosis should be based on age, the severity of onset, weight loss, anemia, cachexia, vomiting, coffee-ground vomitus, lack of free hydrochloric acid, the presence of lactic acid bacteria, the location of the tumor, metastasis, etc. However, early diagnosis is difficult.</p>
<p>(Question) What diseases should stomach cancer be differentiated from?</p>
<p>(Answer) It should be differentiated from gastric ulcer, liver cancer, chronic gastritis, pancreatic cancer, transverse colon cancer, duodenal cancer, pyloric spasm, etc.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the degree of danger of this disease?</p>
<p>(Answer) Absolutely poor. Generally, once the characteristic symptoms appear, death occurs in an average of about one year.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the treatment methods for stomach cancer?</p>
<p>(Answer) One should always eat easily digestible porridge-like foods. Although meat is disliked, it must also be given, along with internal use of dilute hydrochloric acid and pepsin. Usually, carbohydrates are the main food. Most medications are ineffective. Early surgical operation is best. For stomach bleeding, apply an ice pack to the stomach and try hemostatic agents. Perform gastric lavage every morning and evening to prevent fermentation and stagnation. For stomach pain, use analgesics as a last resort.</p>

<p>(20) Explanation of Brain Leakage (Continued from Previous)</p>
<p>(2) Chronic Maxillary Sinusitis</p>
<p>Chronic maxillary sinusitis is mostly suppurative. Therefore, it is also known as chronic suppurative maxillary sinusitis or maxillary sinus empyema. The most common, largest, and easiest cause of its occurrence is when acute maxillary sinusitis is not treated properly, leading to a chronic condition. At this time, the natural opening of the maxillary sinus is closed, and the function of drainage is also hindered. The mucous membrane inside the sinus is generally swollen with inflammation, and sometimes becomes polypoid. In addition, chronic diseases of the teeth and alveolar ridge, unclean tooth extractions, maxillary bone fractures, traumatic injuries to the maxillary bone, foreign bodies in the maxillary sinus, tuberculosis, syphilis, malignant tumors, etc., can also cause chronic maxillary sinusitis.</p>
<p>The most obvious and painful symptoms of chronic maxillary sinusitis are headaches and neuralgia. Headaches are mostly localized in the forehead. Neuralgia is mostly supraorbital and infraorbital neuralgia. Patients often experience sleep disturbances, mental depression, memory loss, and other symptoms. The nasal cavity is often blocked. A mucopurulent or purely purulent discharge flows from the nose, with a putrid odor. At this time, the sense of smell is also reduced. When there is too much purulent discharge, the pus is often swallowed, irritating the mucous membrane of the stomach and causing chronic digestive diseases. When examining the nasal cavity with a nasal speculum, the mucous membrane of the middle and inferior turbinates can be seen to be generally red and swollen. The middle meatus is filled with pus. The pus is yellow or green and mostly flows forward from the nostril. If this disease lasts for a considerable period of time, mucous nasal polyps (commonly known as nasal fungi) can often occur near the middle meatus. Therefore, I once said in the section on "Nasal Polyps" that "nasal polyps are not a separate disease, but an inflammatory product of another disease." Now, it can probably be understood more clearly.</p>
<p>The course of chronic maxillary sinusitis is very slow, often lasting for more than ten years. The best treatment method is to have a detailed examination by a specialist physician and carefully perform puncture and lavage or radical surgery. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e201">Common Treatment Methods for Fever (4) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>In the case of short-term fever, even if the body does not receive sufficient nutrients, the body can sacrifice its own cells as fuel to barely get through. After recovery, the existing losses can be replenished. In the case of long-term fever, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, typhoid fever, heart inflammation, and prolonged pneumonia, if the food supplied during the illness does not contain enough nutrients, the body will initially become thin and then, due to a lack of nutrients, the ability to resist bacteria will be reduced. It is like an army lacking all supplies during a war; military failure is inevitable. If the body lacks resistance when sick, a minor illness will naturally become a serious illness, and a serious illness will be overwhelming. More than twenty years ago, doctors often starved feverish patients to reduce their fever. However, in recent years, it has been known that this theory is completely wrong. Today, through experience and research, it has been confirmed that if feverish patients are provided with a scientific diet that supplies all the nutrients needed by the body, the outcome of the disease will be much better, and many deaths can be avoided. Even for the same disease that used to be fatal, the new treatment method can bring life from death. Some people ask how it can be proven that the new medical method is correct and the old medical method is wrong? According to American medical statistics, twenty years ago, the mortality rate of typhoid fever was 20% (i.e., on average, twenty out of every hundred people with typhoid fever died). Recent statistics show that the mortality rate of typhoid fever is 10%. Although there have been various advances in recent treatment methods, the biggest advance in the case of typhoid fever lies in the scientificization of the patient's diet.</p>
<p>Some people ask what is meant by the scientificization of diet? Now we know that a car uses a certain amount of gasoline, oil, and water to travel a certain distance. For example, a large car consumes one gallon of gasoline every ten miles, a medium-sized car consumes one gallon of gasoline every twenty miles, and a small car consumes one gallon of gasoline every forty miles. In recent years, medical research has revealed the metabolism, heat generation, and energy generation of the human body, as well as the role of diet in the body, and the specific amount of diet needed at a specific time. Knowing a person's height, weight, age, and gender, one can know how much food must be used to make the body's nutrients suitable. Organic chemistry has shown us what chemical components are in what foods, how much heat is generated by how much food, and how much energy is generated. Our understanding of the human body's food needs is almost the same as calculating for a car or a machine. Ordinary people naturally think it is very miraculous, but it is only the culmination of countless scientific and medical research in recent decades.</p>
<p>The heat value of food is called calories. This is like measuring rice with a dou and a sheng. One calorie (large calorie) is the amount of heat that can raise the temperature of one thousand cubic centimeters (cc) of water by one degree (Celsius). The calorie value of food is calculated by burning the food with a standard electrical device and measuring the total amount of heat generated, in calories. This is the method used to calculate the heat value of food in the body. One gram of carbohydrate (starch and sugar) or one gram of protein can generate four calories of heat. One gram of oil or fat can generate nine calories of heat. For example, one pound of bread can generate 1260 calories of heat. One egg can generate 70 calories of heat. A small bowl of cooked rice can generate more than 200 calories of heat. A cup of milk can generate 160 calories of heat.</p>
<p>Now that the calorie value of food is known, the second step is to know how much food a person needs to meet their consumption, and to what extent they need to be fed when they have a fever so that they do not damage their own cells. How can they have sufficient supplies to overcome the bacteria and recover from the disease? Through years of research by physiologists, we already know the specific needs of the human body. For example, a person weighing 150 pounds needs 1770 calories for 24 hours of rest. A seamstress needs 2240 calories. A shoemaker needs 2600 calories. A machinist needs 3000 calories. A carpenter needs 3300 calories. A stonemason needs 4300 calories. A sawyer needs 4900 calories. This is why a dockworker eats more food in one day than a sedentary person eats in three days. As mentioned in the previous article, when a person has a fever, their body needs more nutrients. Each degree of fever increases the need by 10%. A patient with typhoid fever needs approximately 3000 calories of nutrients in 24 hours. If they do not eat any food for a day, they must turn their body cells into fuel for the body. One day is not a big deal. In ten or twenty days, if there are not enough nutrients, the body will naturally become thin to the extreme. From this, it can be seen that insufficient diet will definitely reduce the patient's resistance. If the body is supplied with all the necessary nutrients using medical methods, the body's resistance will be sufficient, and there will be more certainty of overcoming the disease.</p>
<p>Whether the diet is appropriate for a fever of one or two days is not important, but it is extremely important for long-term fever, because whether the nutrients are sufficient or not is extremely related to the turning point of the disease. Another thing to note is that feverish patients have poor appetites, and it is necessary to give them a proper diet to be beneficial. The proper diet is described below.</p>
<p>Fluids: Adequate fluids are the most needed thing for feverish patients. We know that water is the best solvent. During a fever, the body's blood is full of toxins and waste. Toxins come from bacteria, and waste is the result of chemical metabolism in the body. The higher the fever, the more chemical activity in the body, and the more waste. If these toxins and waste are fully dissolved by water, they can be excreted through urination, defecation, skin, sweating, or lung respiration. The better the excretion function, the easier it is for the disease to heal. Conversely, if the body lacks water and cannot excrete toxins and waste, the disease will naturally worsen. In addition to this reason, water is an indispensable element of life, and it is indispensable for all parts of the body. If it is lacking, it will stop functioning. When fever causes sweating or diarrhea, the water in the body is used up; if the stomach lacks water, it cannot produce gastric juice, and digestion stops. If the salivary glands lack water, not only cannot food be digested, but it is also not easy to swallow. For example, during cholera, because the water in the body is vomited and excreted from the body, the lack of water in the blood causes the blood to be particularly thick, and the blood flow stops, resulting in loss of life. Since water is so important, it must be supplied to the patient sufficiently. Give him water every one or two hours, not only without waiting for him to drink, but not even allowing his tongue, head, or lips to feel dry. The hotter the patient is, the more delirious he is and the less he knows he wants to drink water. If he cannot drink water himself, special methods must be used to supply his body with water. The best drink for patients is cold boiled water.</p>
<p>If you want to know if the patient's drinks are enough, you can measure how much urine he passes in a day and night. One thousand cc (about two pounds) is enough. Less than one thousand cc is not enough. The less the urine, the more the body lacks water. The remedy is to give him more water. Sometimes patients cannot drink water and the following methods must be used to add water to the body: (1) Irrigate the large intestine with water to make it absorbed into the body. Glucose can also be added to the water. Two or three times a day. (2) Inject saline solution under the skin. (3) Inject saline solution or glucose water or glucose saline solution intravenously. If these methods are used properly, they can sometimes have the effect of bringing back the dead.</p>
<p>Proper Food: Food is as urgent as drinks. Patients with fever have poor appetites, and ordinary food cannot be eaten. Patients are using all their strength to fight bacteria, so their digestive function is also very weak. Therefore, it is necessary to provide fully proper food, otherwise the patient cannot get sufficient nutrients. Patients should be provided with digestible food that is rich in starch and sugars, because these are important raw materials needed for fever. Note that if you give the patient indigestible food, it is better not to give him food at all. In short, the food needed by patients is (1) easy to digest (2) liquid food (3) raw materials for generating energy and heat (4) the patient has weak digestive power, so give him less food each time (5) the patient needs a large amount of nutrients, so give less food each time, and give several meals a day. Give him some food every one or two hours, eight to ten meals a day for people with high fever. Note that do not wake the patient up to eat when he is sleeping, because sleep is also essential for the body.</p>
<p>The following foods can be given to him two or three items at a time according to the patient's appetite: a bowl of thin porridge with a spoonful of sugar. Orange juice or oranges. Any fruit, one cup at a time, one cup of milk at a time. If you cannot afford milk, a small bowl of soy milk is similar in function to milk. Eggs can be poured with boiling water, soft-boiled, steamed, or eaten raw. Lotus root powder soup with sugar. Cooked fruits, such as pears and peaches, watermelon juice. Lemonade with sugar, grape juice, pineapple juice, rice soup, noodle soup with sugar. Various vegetable soups. Ice cream, chicken soup, fish soup, and meat soup are very good but should not be overdone. Tea or coffee with milk and sugar. The patient should be given high-quality food. Note that spoiled food will make a sick person sick and a sick person die. Tea or coffee should not be given to the patient at night because tea and coffee are stimulating and can easily cause the patient to lose sleep. Those who are used to drinking alcohol do not need to quit when they are sick. Although alcohol has a few harmful effects, it can also generate heat in the body. As the disease gradually recovers, the diet can gradually increase from liquid to soft foods, and finally gradually return to the usual diet. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Chapter 8 Clinical Examination Methods</p>
<p>(1) Past History: The methods used by doctors to diagnose diseases are certainly complex and unusual, but in fact, they can be divided into two things: first, questioning, and second, examination. The past history presented in this section is entirely obtained through questioning procedures. What is past history? The scope included in this aspect is also very broad. The doctor should ask about the patient's name, age, address, occupation, gender, usual living conditions, habits, whether there are hereditary diseases, and the symptoms from the past to the present, without being annoyed by trivial details. Pulmonary tuberculosis is a very complex chronic disease (sometimes it can become a lifelong disease), and the various causes and consequences of it cannot be ignored. The few things to ask about, on the surface, seem to have little to do with the disease itself, but they are actually the first step in the doctor's diagnosis of a disease. Just take pulmonary tuberculosis as an example. There are already many examples in this area. We know that this disease can invade at any age, but the nature of the disease is not without distinction. For example, the disease in middle-aged people is mostly chronic, and the prognosis is better. In infants under two years old, it is acute, and the prognosis is extremely poor. In adolescents from three or four years old to fifteen or sixteen years old, the invasion of this disease is better, but in the ten years after that, it is completely different! These are all differences that occur due to different ages. Stoneworkers and tobacco workers who inhale harmful dust are more susceptible to invasion than others. This is a difference that occurs due to occupation. Big cities are worse than rural areas, and industrial areas are even worse; low, humid, and dirty houses are worse than houses with sunlight and air circulation. This is a difference that occurs due to address. The aspect of living conditions and habits is also obvious. People who are mentally and physically overworked are certainly more susceptible to invasion, and those who have a habit of smoking and drinking are worse than those who do not. These real examples can be seen by everyone. As for the examples of past diseases, that is even more obvious. Diseases such as rickets, pertussis, pneumonia, pleurisy, measles, syphilis, and influenza are all very easy to induce this disease. In particular, exudative pleurisy is almost 95% causally related to this disease. Based on these examples, we can at least know that the doctor's inquiry about past history is a very meaningful work and is indispensable for the initial stage of diagnosing a disease.</p>
<p>In addition to the various things mentioned above, there are several other things that should not be easily overlooked when inquiring about the past history of pulmonary tuberculosis. These should also be specifically mentioned here. These include the women's menstrual status, puerperal condition, whether the baby is healthy, whether the nutrition is natural or artificial; diseases other than this disease in the past, the signs of past tuberculosis and glandular diseases, the specific causes of the current disease, the patient's economic situation, the opportunity for infection, trauma, the signs of the initial disease, the symptoms, and the detailed course of treatment. Each and every real situation in these is related to the current disease itself. Both the doctor and the patient should pay attention to it without being annoyed by the complexity of the matter.</p>

<p>— Jin Ru</p>
<p>(3) Facilities (1) School Buildings: The school buildings are located at 410 Avenue Albert, French Concession, Shanghai. This is the former site of the Tongji Medical and Engineering School, situated between Rue Gan Shi Dong and Avenue Albert. To the right is the Mingfu Library, and to the left is the Sino-French National Engineering College. The area covers eight acres, four fen, and five li. There is a square athletic field covering one acre. There is a one-story building and two German-style buildings, built in 1908. According to the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, these were allocated for joint Sino-French cultural and educational endeavors. Originally, it was part of the Sino-French National Engineering College's facilities, managed by the college. They were lent to the Joint Sericulture Improvement Association as a clubhouse. When the specialized course was first established, it rented the left side of the Sericulture Improvement Association's building, consisting of only three classrooms and one each for the laboratory, office, and storage of medicines and equipment. By the autumn of 1919, due to an increase in practical courses, the buildings were insufficient. The school authorities then negotiated with the Sericulture Improvement Association to rent a portion of the two-story building on the right and the entire ground floor, totaling fourteen rooms. The various laboratories were reorganized. In 1920, the school again obtained the consent of the Sericulture Improvement Association, and the Sino-French National Engineering College issued a letter agreeing to allocate the entire western portion of the building to the department as permanent school buildings. This is the current school building, which was reported to the ministry for record in 1921. It includes seven large laboratories, four classrooms, a library, a balance room, an equipment storage room, a medicine storage room, a school supplies storage room, a faculty lounge, a student lounge, an exercise room, a general office, a garage, a kitchen, a dining hall, and a reception room, each with one room, and two faculty preparation rooms.</p>
<p>(2) Dormitories: Starting in the autumn of 1920, male and female dormitories were added. The male dormitory is located at 6-7 Rue de Sieyes, West Sieyes Lane, two three-story Western-style buildings. There are fourteen bedrooms of varying sizes. The larger rooms can accommodate six people, and the smaller rooms can accommodate four people. There are four bathrooms, two washrooms, a reception room, and a dormitory supervisor's room, each with one room. The female dormitory is located south of the school at 20 Bu Gao Lane, Avenue Albert, two two-story buildings. The internal layout is similar to the male dormitory, but on a smaller scale. In the summer vacation of 1920, the dormitory was expanded by renting 6-8, Lane 17, Rue de Sieyes, three three-story Western-style buildings, which can accommodate approximately fifty students.</p>
<p>(3) Medicinal Garden: In 1921, a medicinal garden was added to cultivate Chinese and foreign medicinal plants for research by faculty and students. It is located behind Jinan University in Zhenru, covering approximately twenty acres. A specialized worker was hired to cultivate the land and be responsible for guarding it. Currently, the planted medicinal herbs include Datura, foxglove, lavender, black horehound, white horehound, apple eggplant, wild cherry, mustard, safflower, and more than ten other types.</p>
<p>(4) Laboratories: When the department was first established, the regular course admitted one class of first-year students. The practical courses were divided into qualitative analytical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and plant specimen preparation. Due to the cramped school buildings, the laboratory was simple, with only one large room downstairs, which is now the qualitative analytical chemistry laboratory. In July 1919, two major sections were added: one for animal, microscope, and physiology practical rooms, and the other for crude drug and pharmaceutical practical rooms. Other facilities such as the physics laboratory (darkroom, spectrometer, etc.), chemistry laboratory, preparation room, and storage room were gradually established and improved annually according to the volume of the school building and the needs of the curriculum. Currently, they are divided into three departments: physical chemistry, animal and plant, and pharmaceutical preparation. There are seven laboratories in total: a physics laboratory, an inorganic and organic chemistry laboratory, a qualitative and quantitative analytical chemistry laboratory, an animal and plant laboratory, a microbiology laboratory, a pharmaceutical chemistry laboratory, and a dispensing laboratory. All equipment, light intensity, and the height and orientation of the tables and cabinets have been meticulously designed to meet the needs of various experiments. Separate instrument, medicine, and specimen storage rooms are provided, with each section's teaching assistant responsible for management. It is said that the department plans to add three to four more laboratories, but has not yet started due to economic difficulties.</p>
<p>(5) Instruments and Specimens: Instruments such as colorimeters, spectrometers, polarimeters, and other experimental supplies are mostly purchased from France. Specimens are mostly collected from Germany. Chemical reagents that are needed temporarily are purchased locally. When the department was established, over 30,000 yuan was spent on purchasing instruments and specimens from Germany and France. Donations from domestic and foreign pharmaceutical factories and merchants also amounted to about 10,000 yuan. In 1922, another 10,000 yuan was spent on purchasing instruments from France. This amount was subsidized by the Shanghai French Municipal Council. This summer vacation, the Ministry of Education approved a subsidy of 10,000 yuan in national currency annually for library and instrument equipment. The department plans to use 30% of this specifically for purchasing instruments or specimens. Combined with the Municipal Council's subsidy of 10,000 yuan, the annual equipment budget for instruments and specimens will be 13,000 yuan in the future.</p>

<p>Chapter 3: Not Yet Understanding the Wandering, Peeking; Young Girl Wishes to Hear of Hardships, Visiting the Poor</p>
<p>It is just such a black 馍, half a bowl of cold water, squatting on the ground to eat. If it is in a circle surrounded by four or five people, there are also two earthenware dishes, one large and one small. In the large dish is a small handful of chives, which a person with a large mouth can simply swallow in one gulp. In the small dish is some chili powder, mixed with liquid. According to the rules of poor people in the Northwest for eating chili, that is probably vinegar. Watching them eat, they use the tips of their chopsticks to pick up a piece of chive, put it in their mouths and slowly chew it, and then pick up some chili powder and spread it on the cold 馍, and eat it like that. Some people use the palm of their hand to hold some salt, and mix it with the chili powder in the water and stir it. Immediately, the white water turns into a color that is neither red nor black; presumably that is considered a bowl of soup. Cheng Zhiqian was watching, somewhat lost in thought, when he saw a young carpenter walk in from outside, holding a small paper package in his hand, raising it high, and greeting his companions. Immediately, two or three people stretched out their necks and shouted, "Give me a little, give me a little." Seeing that person sit down among his companions, cautiously opening the paper package. Cheng Zhiqian strolled behind them to see what it was, and it turned out to be a small teaspoon of white sugar. In Jiangnan, it would be worth at most one small copper coin. But this craftsman held this slightly grayish sugar in his hand, and divided it in half with his chopsticks, making two portions. The larger portion was poured into the bowl of water in front of him. The smaller portion was handed to an older companion next to him. He himself used his chopsticks to stir the large half bowl of sugar water greatly for a while, and then held it in one hand and picked up the black 馍 in the other. He took a bite of the 馍, and used his lips to sip a little sugar water and swallowed it. Seeing how much he valued that half bowl of sugar water, it was no less than a bowl of ginseng soup. Just at this time, a large fat man, with a protruding belly, walked over. Seeing him wearing a set of student uniform made of sesame tweed, in this city of Xi'an, he was already considered a modern figure. (4-5)</p>
<h3 id="e205">Grinding Ink <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Huo Xueming</p>
<p>Most writers nowadays use Western paper and blue ink when writing manuscripts; naturally, there is no need to grind a stick of pine soot ink in the inkstone. Moreover, writing with a fountain pen is indeed much simpler and faster than writing one word and dipping the brush in ink each time. I have never seen the words on the manuscripts of my friends more regular and beautiful than the original manuscript of "Haishang Flower" by Mr. Zeng Mengpu, the "Sick Man of East Asia" (seen at Mr. Zhang Ruogu's place). Mr. Zeng's solemnity and calmness when writing his novel can be seen in his meticulously written regular script, as delicate as an examination paper.</p>
<p>Thus, I imagined Mr. Zeng in his exquisite study, sitting by the bright window, how he raised his brush to write his article. The fragrance of flowers outside the study, gently flowing, good birds singing quietly, the fragrance of ink lightly drifting, at this time, he was seriously but also briskly creating an immortal masterpiece. Alas, I regret not taking a trip to Changshu for his sixtieth birthday two years ago.</p>
<p>And myself? Every morning, I also enjoy copying a little from stone rubbings. If a young person can cultivate his mind, practicing writing Chinese characters is the most effective method. Therefore, every evening, after writing, when reading ancient books, I use my idle right hand to effortlessly grind ink on the inkstone, circling it around and around.</p>
<p>Grinding ink also requires art. At least warriors or impatient people cannot grind ink. To grind good ink, one must be calm, focused, and serene, to grind it finely, evenly, richly, and clearly. There is no environment more comfortable than reading under the lamp and smelling the fragrance of ink. As for saving time and adding to the pleasure, those are secondary matters.</p>
<p>I remember that Mr. Qin Wenyi of my hometown used to have two lines of ink inscription saying: "It is not the person grinding the ink, but the ink grinding the person." That truly expresses the sentiments of a scholar. I don't know how many years I will have to be ground into a skeleton by ink.</p>

<p>How fortunate it is, the greatest, most sublime building, in Shanghai, the leader of all buildings, the twenty-two story building – to be able to visit it on a cloudy afternoon.</p>
<p>The bottom floor is very messy, under renovation. The folding doors of the three elevators, painted a light green base, covered with golden flowers, very rich and magnificent. The elevators rise and fall more smoothly and quickly than usual, without changes in the brightness of the lights, perhaps one might even think they are still stationary when rising!</p>
<p>The elevator route only reaches the eighteenth floor, and no further – in the corner of the twentieth floor is the main control system for the elevators. When the elevators rise and fall, the huge wheels turn very quickly. This is so much like the process of life – advancing forward. The rooms of the International Hotel, teak floors, teak doors, inlaid with sparkling mirrors, bathrooms, toilets, all exceptionally clean, everywhere revealing the extravagance of the city, making people envious.</p>
<p>Standing on the top floor, looking into the distance, everything is a hazy white, the sky and earth mixed together; the houses all look like chicken coops, the vast racecourse, green grass revealing the white and gray lines of the tracks, exactly like a natural oil painting; the roads seem to have shrunk a lot, the vehicles moving, also losing their original state of being small and elongated. The wind is especially strong and forceful, there are railings around, looking down at the bottom floor, one's legs tremble uncontrollably, shrinking back, even though one is a enjoyer, with no danger involved, still so timid, trembling, shrinking back, recalling the creators at that time, what their situation was really like, one wonders. The golden ball at the very top, surrounded by small pieces of magnetic stone, brushed with a golden powder, shows its arrogance in the clouds.</p>
<p>Once it's completed, perhaps we won't be allowed to leave our footprints freely anymore!</p>

<p>Having washed away the makeup, she is pitiable in her simplicity. The round fan in her sleeve has been there for three years. May her graceful image remain in the next life. In the ancestral temple among the willows, worship the water fairy.</p>
<p>Why was the jade concubine banished to the riverbank? Returning her bright pearl, only tears remain. It's better to let the painter have the good fortune. In the morning, he personally paints her long eyebrows.</p>
<p>The musk, ground into dust, gives off a fragrance even in death. News from the sea and mountains is cut off, no longer heard. I'll use ten thousand entangled words. To inscribe on the beautiful woman's white silk skirt.</p>
<p>Early on, she knew that life and death return to the great transformation. The hardest thing is to find a confidante among the beautiful. An ordinary sheet of xuan paper. Can convey emotions with the arch of her eyebrows.</p>
<p>Floating clouds and bright moon meet in the sky. The small fan and simple dress are a dream. Every time I write, I think of the horizon. No need to abruptly call her Zhenzhen.</p>

<p>Because the Beijing-Fengtian Railway was built along the coastline, we could often see the coast of Liaodong Bay flickering in our eyes as we looked east from the train.</p>
<p>My feelings after entering the three northeastern provinces were very complex: but the deepest point was that I felt that the situation here still could not get rid of a kind of original wildness. I think that is correct! Because hundreds or thousands of years ago, our ancestors were originally a very strong and untamed people; relying on their strong physique and courageous胆力, they roamed freely in this vast wilderness. Except for a part of what they used daily which was grown from the fields, the rest was obtained from hunting; in this way, the combat power of this nation was strengthened unintentionally, and later they were able to conquer the entire territory of China proper with tens of thousands of troops, without much effort. Although the Bannermen in the interior have gradually become weak, the people in the three northeastern provinces outside the customs still retain some of the heredity of the nomadic people – brave and rough.</p>
<p>Along the way, we also passed several county towns scattered on both sides. These county towns were very small and far from the tracks. Looking at them from the train, they seemed to be at the end of the horizon. If it weren't for Zhang De, the more familiar eunuch, pointing them out to us, we would never have thought that a black mass of shadows was a county town, and 99% of the time we would have thought it was a large rock that had collapsed from the mountain.

<h3 id="e211">Wang Ziping's Adventure in Jinan <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenlü</p>
<p>When the news that Zhang Xuebin was setting up a boxing ring in the Greater Shanghai Garden spread throughout Shanghai, I couldn't help but think of martial artist Wang Ziping's amazing adventure in Jinan. I'm afraid very few people know about this, although it happened ten years ago, I will record this old news here, which can also be considered as keeping up with the times.</p>
<p>One day, I went to visit my friend Jin Wentao; he had also put in a lot of effort in martial arts and had unique achievements. Now he lives in seclusion in Shanghai, only using his very effective massage skills to treat people and support himself. That day, I saw a guest with a short and sturdy figure, dark complexion, bright eyes, speaking with a northern accent, silent and taciturn. The posture he was sitting in was as stable as iron, his bearing serious, different from ordinary people. After a while, he left. I eagerly asked Brother Wentao: "Is that person Wang Ziping?" Because I knew that he and Wang were like-minded comrades, he smiled and nodded. Discussions about all things martial arts then took place, and in narrating Wang Ziping's life, I especially felt that the "Jinan incident" was worth noting and remembering.</p>
<p>That year, Wang Ziping was hired by the highest military authority of Shandong Province to train a group of lower-ranking officers in martial arts, with the honorable title of coach. There was more than one coach, and the rest all admired Wang, and in daily life, they all expressed special respect to him. Among them, there was a certain foreign coach, who did not see any special talents in Wang, and was very suspicious of the attitude of his peers. He alone refused to accept it and showed contempt. Someone told him: "This Coach Wang is famous throughout the country and has real skills." He immediately found Wang and wanted to compete with him. Wang was originally the most peaceful and humble person, believing that he was merely living up to a false reputation, and declined the match. That foreigner thought he was just pretending to be modest and despised him even more. In his daily speech, he often used insulting tones and threatened to compete at every turn. Finally, one day, both parties invited witnesses and signed a contract stating that if there was any accidental injury, it was all considered fate. Under duress, Wang sent that foreign coach to his death with one punch.</p>
<p>Among the witnesses was also a staff member of a certain foreign consulate. At first, because he knew that the coach's skills were already at home, there was no danger to his life, but when he sacrificed under a fair punch, he could only feel frustrated and had nothing to say. However, a group of foreign students, who had been taught martial arts by that coach, secretly plotted revenge day and night, also harboring the side effect of eliminating outstanding talents from our country. Someone secretly told Wang to take precautions, but he believed that humans always value reason, and that no civilized country would do barbaric things, so he did not worry at all; in fact, because he had skills, he was confident that he could defend himself, so he was inevitably arrogant.</p>
<p>One day, Wang went to a movie theater as usual for entertainment. Not long after the movie started, he happened to look back and saw, by the light of the movie, that the ten rows behind his seat were full of uniformed foreign students. He immediately became alert and weighed how he could resist if there was any trouble, being alone and unarmed. While he was hesitating, a flashlight suddenly shone on him, and a gunshot rang out. Fortunately, he was short in stature, and immediately squatted down, avoiding the first bullet; then, like an arrow flying off the string, his body shot straight to the empty stage in front, actually leaping over the heads of people in nearly ten rows of seats. Without hesitation, amidst a hail of gunfire, he leaped from the stage to the central gallery, his toes touching the backs of the seats, and in three or two leaps, he reached the side of the wall. He didn't hesitate even more, and with three or two punches, he knocked a big hole in the brick wall, retreated slightly, put his body diagonally through it, jumped out of the window into the street, and fled away! There were also one or two foreign students standing guard in front of the theater door, only preventing the opponent from escaping from the main entrance, preparing to intercept them head-on. How could they have expected a Flying General to descend from the sky? In the confusion and panic, they drew their guns and chased after him, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>Having experienced this dangerous situation, Wang deeply regretted the immorality of the certain foreign national character, and only then did he feel that this Jinan was not his comfortable hometown. He also did not want the government to handle this weak country diplomacy for him, so he hurriedly resigned from his position as coach and quietly left.</p>

<h3 id="e212">China's Monetary Panic <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Lecture by G.E. Hubbard, Translated by Xie Juceng</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the silver export tax rate on October 15th, the market has undergone significant changes in the past three or four days. The primary reason for this, in my opinion, is due to speculative merchants alarming each other, creating something out of nothing. Mr. G.E. Hubbard, a well-known foreign exchange broker in Shanghai, gave a detailed explanation based on his extensive experience and calm mind at the Rotary Club on the 18th. His words were of great value, and are hereby introduced to the readers of this publication.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Juceng</p>
<p>The currency panic in China began to show signs a few years ago, entirely due to the impact of the world economic panic, and not due to China's own faults. When the world economic panic erupted at the end of 1929, our observation was that the first commodity to quickly decline in price was silver. There is a saying in society – I don't know what principle it's based on – that the wholesale prices of all commodities in the world can be represented by silver. When you see the price of silver falling, you can see the prices of other goods also falling. When the price of silver rises, the prices of other goods also rise. As for which of these many commodities is affected first, it's hard to say. However, according to the charts I have compiled, it can be proved that the above observation is correct. And in any case, we saw the price of silver fall to such an extent in 1929, 1930, and 1931 that everyone couldn't help but be surprised. Whether this situation is good or bad depends on the situation, and I dare not guess arbitrarily. What I say is fair and unbiased. At that time, many worried friends strongly advocated implementing a silver import tax, or even prohibiting the import of silver, so that the world could no longer dump silver into China. I immediately felt that this was not a smart solution, because there is no such thing as dumping for silver. Goods may be dumped, but as for silver, the more China has, the better. At that time, Finance Minister Song Ziwen took no action on this, which deserves our praise. As a result, China benefited greatly from allowing the free inflow of silver into the country, receiving a lot of silver.</p>
<p>In the past twelve years – from 1921 to 1933 – Shanghai, the financial center of China, imported silver from overseas and inland areas worth approximately 550,000,000 yuan. However, we transported more to the inland areas than was transported out of them. The effect of the financial authorities allowing the free import of silver was that, except for a very small number of people close to the New York Stock Exchange, no one believed that there was a world economic panic. Wholesale prices in China did not fall but rose, so China became the only country in the world to avoid being shrouded in recession. This trend remained consistent until 1932. From that time on, beginning with Britain's departure from the gold standard in 1931, followed by Japan, China began to suffer a major blow. Later, in 1933, the United States followed suit, and we felt the impact becoming more and more serious, because the purchasing power of the US and Britain was reduced compared to before. In other words, since 1933, prices in China have gradually fallen, putting China in a position difficult to curb deflation. The so-called deflation means that China cannot even maintain its small export trade, and imports are booming, so that the situation is getting more and more serious. I cannot say that we immediately feel a significant impact due to the trade deficit; but people saw that the situation was getting worse and worse, and clearly saw that some things were being reversed, so they became suspicious.</p>
<p>We have seen capital flowing out of China. Originally, in the previous few years – 1930, 1931, 1932 – many foreign companies here kept their private funds in China, and even remitted funds from abroad to China. Because they said, "We want to wait for a better exchange rate, and China is in a good economic position." But as soon as they saw that the situation was not right, they couldn't help but start to worry, so they moved all of their silver supply back to their home countries, or left Chinese ports. Just starting from April this year – there was no movement in January to March – silver began to be exported. Based on the published statistics I have collected and calculated, I am confident that China owns at least 2 billion ounces of silver – including the three northeastern provinces and Mongolia. China has lost silver worth 200 million yuan in the recent past six months. This number cannot be said to be small, but if we consider that China has received silver from foreign countries worth as much as 550 million yuan in the past twelve years, this situation does not seem very significant. The only problem is that by this time, there is already a lack of public confidence.</p>
<p>You often hear that China needs to ship silver to balance the trade deficit, and I also admit that there is this need. But I dare say that the silver shipped for export is actually used to offset the trade deficit, but accounts for only a very small portion, of which 75 percent belongs to the outflow of capital. Generally speaking, once a panic begins, this kind of thing is difficult to curb.</p>
<p>Whether the Chinese government should let this action run its course or should curb it is a matter that needs to be considered. When it comes to curbing it, we can get the following two effects from the minds of economists and authorities. First, to preserve China's existing silver. Second, to stop the fall in prices. The Chinese government has shown great patience on this issue. Because they saw silver flowing out, and they also acknowledged the outflow of capital – not only limited to foreigners, but also Chinese people shipping it abroad. They are in a difficult position, because if they allow silver to flow out without restriction, we will wake up one morning and find that we are all on a paper standard. All current banknotes cannot be redeemed, and there is only one way to sell goods, which is to use banknotes.</p>
<p>About ten days ago, another 25 million yuan in cash was shipped out, and another batch of 9.5 million yuan was being packed for shipment. Later, the government's tax order was issued, so the export of silver stopped – I cannot say it was prohibited.</p>
<p>The authorities have considered three plans regarding the silver issue. First, to ban the export of silver, but everyone thought this plan was inappropriate, and I also thought it was very right, because banning the export of silver might lead to worse results. Second, to increase the export tax, which is the plan that is currently being implemented. Third, is a very interesting question, which is to abolish silver coins and introduce the gold standard to China.</p>
<p>China adopting the gold standard would originally be a very good thing, but at present, there is no preparation at all. Everyone recalls the 1929 Kemmerer Commission's recommendations on this point, and their conclusion that it could not be implemented immediately, and it will become clear. Because China does not have the necessary gold reserves, and the provinces of China cannot be fully united to implement this plan.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, everyone should pay attention to the importance of the Kemmerer Commission. Because as a result of their work, the current gold unit was created. This system works very well, otherwise China's finances would have been on the verge of bankruptcy, and in 1930, 1931, and 1932, China's tariff revenue would never have been able to offset foreign debt. But it is impossible to adopt the gold standard at this moment. Even in the last few moments, I am afraid it will not work. The reasons are as follows: First, China has never stored enough gold coins; second, I don't believe that China can currently obtain enough gold coins to start implementing the gold standard. Many contemporary people have made many suggestions on this issue. Among them, Mr. Gu Jigao of China State Bank advocated that if the price of silver rises extremely high, China might as well use this opportunity to sell silver and exchange it for gold. This idea is very good, but it is difficult to implement. Because all the silver that China has today does not belong to the government.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the currency reserves in the US and the Bank of England are government property; but when you talk about China's silver, 99 percent does not belong to the government. Therefore, I think nationalizing silver is impossible at the moment. In my personal opinion, the United States is bound by laws and morals to continue its policy of raising silver prices in the next four or five years. The price of silver overseas will inevitably rise sharply as a result. It will not be surprising if the price of silver rises to 70 or 80 cents US after not thinking about it for a long time. I believe that China may one day get the opportunity to profit from exchanging silver for gold, and at the same time put its currency on a gold basis. But this is a matter for the future, we need to calculate the reality, and discuss what kind of situation we are going to encounter now.</p>
<p>The first effect of increasing the silver export tax at this moment was that there was no movement in the market on the first day, but on the second day, the third day, and the fourth day, a danger occurred. I have rarely seen a precedent for this kind of situation. As for myself, many people have called me to ask for my opinion, and I have always answered them: "I don't know anything; I don't think about anything; I don't plan to do anything." This is my imitation of a lecturer's answer to a question twenty years ago. His answer was: "I can tell you definitively, one mistake, silver is going to rise or fall!"</p>
<p>I can say without hesitation that silver is going to rise. So a question comes up, what will China do if the price of silver rises sharply? We have now broken away from silver except domestically. We are already on an active paper currency standard, so if the price of silver rises, we must follow it very, very slowly. But I don't want a high standard. Judging from the situation in the past two days (October 17th and 18th), it has created a panic for speculators to offset the short positions they have thrown out. So it is best to have a healthy and very low standard, but I don't believe that this will help China's export trade, or that this limit can save China from difficulties.</p>
<p>There are many people who have suggested ways to help China solve this problem. I also have a plan, which is to ban the import of foreign rice. If the import of foreign rice can be stopped, I think the trade deficit can be eliminated. In the past three or four years, China has imported foreign rice with an average annual value of 100 million silver dollars. Just this number is enough to balance the trade deficit. Moreover, as far as I can see, this will definitely not cause people to starve to death. This is an obvious fact that China's rice yield per acre is only half of that of Japan, which shows that the methods used and the fertilizers applied in China lack modern scientific improvements. Not only that, due to traffic congestion and transportation difficulties, China's rice cannot circulate freely. It is said that shipping rice from Saigon to Shanghai is cheaper than shipping it from Wuxi to Shanghai. These facts are closely related to the issues we are discussing today.</p>
<p>We are now in the midst of a monetary panic, and the question is what we should do. I believe that if we calm down, we can easily return to the base of one shilling and five pence or one shilling and six pence. I think this base is most suitable for the trade in this port. This is very easy to achieve. I urge everyone not to believe the rumors in the market, and rush into the dangerous whirlpool. I am convinced that the current situation, based on today's environment, is not serious at all. If new methods and new laws are promulgated one after another tomorrow, then the old situation will of course change completely. As for the current situation, there is no need to panic at all. I hope everyone will maintain a calm mind, which is the most important thing in the current period of panic.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Discussion on the Construction of Railway Warehouses <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Shaozeng</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways considers circulating goods and developing the interior as one of its missions. Now, as the rural areas of the interior are on the verge of collapse, the railways should do what they can to provide indirect relief. Following the implementation of responsible freight transportation and responsible water and land combined transportation, in May of the 23rd year, a telegram was sent to various lines ordering them to add freight warehouses. The main points of the original telegram can be analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>Purpose: To assist in the activities of the rural economy, so that industry and commerce can develop in conjunction, and to prevent the imbalance of finance in various regions.</p>
<p>Plan: Focus on constructing freight warehouses at various stations to store excess agricultural products and to allow for loans secured by goods as collateral, so as to facilitate turnover and make railway freight transportation increasingly prosperous.</p>
<p>Warehouse Nature</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary storage: Specifically for cargo owners to store goods on a regular basis, with a small storage fee charged.</p>
<p>(2) Transportation storage: Specifically for goods that have already been accepted for transportation but have not yet been shipped out, for temporary storage, with no storage fee charged.</p>
<p>(3) There is no need to distinguish between ordinary storage and transportation storage during construction, but management should be distinguished according to their nature.</p>
<p>Handling Guidelines</p>
<p>(1) Select a number of stations with the most freight volume, the most urgent need for warehouses, and the potential for merchants to use goods as collateral for loans in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Predict the maximum amount of cargo entering, exiting, and stockpiling at the above stations within the next ten years.</p>
<p>(3) Formulate an overall plan for the construction of freight warehouses over the next ten years, to be implemented year by year.</p>
<p>(4) For the part needed this year, prepare a construction budget according to the standard drawings issued by the Ministry.</p>
<p>(5) The location should be connected and able to accommodate entire trains for loading and unloading.</p>
<p>(6) Consideration should be given to the turnouts for shunting and parking vehicles, so that vehicle operation can be economical.</p>
<p>According to the mission of the railway to circulate goods, it should not simply end with transporting goods from the departure station to the arrival station. The railway cannot but properly store goods that are reported for transportation at the departure station but cannot be loaded immediately; the railway also cannot but properly store goods that have arrived at the arrival station but cannot be immediately taken out or put on the market. Although this type of storage is subject to a certain time limit, so as not to allow long-term stockpiling, which would hinder the storage of later goods, its nature is actually a part of the meaning included in railway transportation. If the railway does not also handle the storage of goods, it cannot fulfill its transportation responsibility. This is what is called transportation storage, or short-term storage, which is actually a direct business of the railway. As for goods that are stored in railway warehouses because they are not intended to be transported and sold urgently, or stockpiled to wait for the right time to seek a good price, or "pledged for loans to facilitate turnover," this is what is called ordinary storage, or long-term storage. According to its nature, it is very different from transportation storage and cannot be said to have any related responsibility to the railway transportation itself. Even if the railway has this ability and can handle it, it is an indirect rather than a direct business, which is undoubtedly clear based on common sense. Moreover, according to Article 613 of the Civil Law, "A warehouse operator is a person who, for remuneration, engages in the business of storing and safekeeping goods for others," and Article 622, "A carrier is a person who engages in the business of transporting goods or passengers and receives freight." Now the railway belongs to the carrier, and is therefore different from the warehouse operator.</p>
<p>Based on the above discussion, since transportation storage is a direct business of the railway, it is indeed necessary for the railway to directly handle it. Therefore, all lines that do not have warehouse facilities, or whose capacity is too small, or whose distribution is not adequate to meet the needs, should follow the instructions of the Ministry's telegram and actively add facilities, at least to meet the needs of transportation storage. As for ordinary storage warehouses, which are used for long-term storage of goods, since they are not a direct business of the railway, whether they should also be directly handled by the railway seems to be open to discussion.</p>
<p>The purpose of the banking industry in constructing warehouses is no more than two items: one is to operate warehousing business, and the other is to handle mortgage loans. For banks, it opens up a way to invest and generate profits, and for merchants, it provides convenience for turnover and finance. Therefore, it is not impossible to say that ordinary storage is a direct business of the bank. As for the railway's ordinary storage, it seems that it does not necessarily have to be directly handled, and there are two reasons for this:</p>
<p>(1) In terms of funding, operating large-scale warehouses is expensive. The railway's main business is transportation, and all capital should of course be invested in rolling stock equipment as a priority. It is difficult to use huge sums of money for warehouses. Moreover, most of our country's railways are built with foreign capital, and their operating income, in addition to all expenses, should also be used to repay principal and pay interest, which is even more difficult to sustain. It is not easy to expand or renovate rolling stock equipment, so how can there be surplus capacity for large-scale ordinary storage warehouses?</p>
<p>(2) In terms of talent, large-scale ordinary storage warehouses, such as various insulation, cooling, and ventilation devices in the cold storage department; such as conveying machine devices and hoisting machine devices in the grain unloading warehouse; cleaning machines, mixing machines, grinding machines, and various devices in the milling workshop; and other warehouse compression devices, packaging devices, canning devices, etc., all belong to specialized technologies. The railway's original talent is mostly biased towards rolling stock transportation. If it is desired to operate ordinary storage warehouses, it is necessary to add specialized talent, which is not allowed by the current financial resources. If the original talent is used to deal with this special business, although temporary planning and supervision can be entrusted to engineering experts to handle, it will be difficult to be competent and happy in the regular management work.</p>
<p>Therefore, the matter of ordinary storage, whether observed from a theoretical or factual perspective, feels that it is better for merchants to handle it than for the railway to handle it, and it is most appropriate for it to be handled by the banking industry. However, no matter what, the warehouse facilities required along the railway line are closely related to railway transportation after all, and the railway cannot only handle transportation storage and ignore ordinary storage. The compromise solution is to divide railway warehouses into four major categories:</p>
<p>The first category is simple transportation warehouses. At stations with sparse freight, the railway only carries sporadic items and packages, and the customers only need simple transportation storage. This type of warehouse has a very simple structure, limited cost, and easy management, and it is also something that the railway must have. Of course, the railway should invest in building it and be responsible for its management.</p>
<p>The second category is mixed transportation and ordinary warehouses. At stations with relatively heavy freight, some only need transportation storage, and some also need ordinary storage. This type of warehouse can be divided into two halves, one for transportation storage and one for ordinary storage; the part belonging to ordinary storage can also be divided into several parts according to the type of goods, so as to store them separately. This type of mixed warehouse is of course more convenient to manage centrally, and the railway should also invest in building it. Fortunately, the scale is not large, the management is easier, and the cost is still limited.</p>
<p>The third category is divided transportation and ordinary warehouses. At stations with very heavy freight, there is a large amount of transportation storage needed, and there is also a large amount of ordinary storage needed, so it is necessary to build transportation warehouses and ordinary warehouses separately. In this case, the transportation warehouse part should of course be invested in and built by the railway, which need not be repeated. There are several possible solutions to the ordinary warehouse problem:</p>
<p>(A) The railway invests in construction and manages it itself;</p>
<p>(B) The railway invests in construction and merchants rent it for operation;</p>
<p>(C) The merchants invest in construction and the railway rents it for operation;</p>
<p>(D) The merchants invest in construction and manage it themselves.</p>
<p>However, for railways with tight financial resources, it may still be most appropriate to adopt method (D). The reasons for this, in addition to the above-mentioned funding and talent, there is another point; if the ordinary warehouses along the railway line are directly operated by banks, then in the event of pledging goods for loans, the bank can easily check, determine the amount of the loan, and easily handle it, so that they can have the certainty of taking it back, so why not do it. And for merchants, on the one hand, they stockpile goods to wait for a good price, and on the other hand, they pledge loans to make other deals, which is tantamount to using a capital of one thousand yuan to do business of several thousand yuan, so why not do it. If this is the case, not only can the railway bill of lading be promoted as much as possible, but its freight transportation will also inevitably develop day by day, which can be asserted. Conversely, if the railway itself operates ordinary warehouses, since it cannot also handle large-scale loans, it cannot achieve this great effect.</p>
<p>The fourth category is simple ordinary storage. Although this type of storage is usually called a warehouse, in fact, in addition to storing goods, it also has the following special functions:</p>
<p>(A) Intermediate assembly: The railway allows the consignor to gradually concentrate less-than-carload goods at the locations it passes through, in order to load them into a whole car in the future and transport them to the destination, without affecting its full-journey freight rate.</p>
<p>(B) Intermediate compression: The railway allows the consignor to unload hay, rice stalks, wheat stalks, cotton, and other items at a certain location it passes through, and then incorporate them into the whole car after reducing the volume, and transport them to the destination.</p>
<p>(C) Intermediate warehousing: The railway allows the consignor to unload rice into the intermediate grain warehouse to wait for mixing, bleaching, soil removal, air drying, grading, bagging, weighing, and re-transporting, without affecting its full-journey freight rate.</p>
<p>(D) Intermediate grinding: The railway allows the consignor to unload wheat and other items in the middle and grind them into flour before transporting them out.</p>
<p>(E) Intermediate packing: The railway allows the consignor to unload oil in the middle and pack it into large barrels or drum-shaped containers for re-transporting, etc.</p>
<p>All of this is what the United States calls special transportation business, which is also needed in our country at present but has not yet been implemented. This type of warehouse is very large in scale, extremely expensive, and the management work is also very heavy. Judging from the current situation of our country's railways, it is definitely difficult to be competent, so it should be independently built by merchants and managed by merchants themselves.</p>
<p>As for its location, it is most suitable to be about halfway along the railway line from the main production area to the main consumption area, such as Benniu on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and other similar places. Because the land price is low and the wages are cheap, the cost of building a sales warehouse here is much lower than in Wuxi, Shanghai, and other places; and it is easier to start expanding at any time according to needs than in Wuxi, Shanghai, and other places. This is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>If a large amount of goods is directly transported from the production area to the consumer market, at the departure station, one already feels the large number of parking spaces occupied and the huge freight cost, and when arriving at the arrival station, if it cannot be sold immediately and must be stored in a warehouse, one must also feel the large number of storage spaces occupied and the huge storage rent cost. If there is such a large-scale warehouse and workshop in the middle, so that goods can be unloaded in the middle, sporadic ones can be combined, huge ones can be compressed, rice grains can be removed from their bran, coarse cotton can be rolled into fine cotton, wheat can be ground into flour, copper and iron can be cast into bars, etc., the storage and manufacturing costs are lower than in the city, and the manufactured products are re-transported, the parking spaces occupied are smaller, and the freight costs are less. When they are transported to the market, they can be sold immediately. What is the economic convenience like? This is the second reason.</p>
<p>From the railway's point of view, the raw materials transported occupy more parking spaces, and the freight collected is of course more, but the grades of the manufactured products are higher. Although the parking spaces occupied are smaller, the loss is negligible when the two are compared. According to the principle of railway transportation, it is better to transport more manufactured products than to transport more raw materials. The former costs more parking spaces and requires more vehicles; the latter saves parking spaces and can use one vehicle for two, which is very economical for equipment, especially for railways with insufficient financial resources. Moreover, if there are such warehouses and workshops along the railway line, all kinds of goods will be happy with its convenience and will inevitably gather together. The railway only needs to lay turnouts to control them and set appropriate freight rates to attract them, and there is no need to worry about the competitive forces of other transportation businesses. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>Recently, the railway authorities have been making every effort to promote responsible freight transportation. If the railway does not properly plan for the storage of goods, it will not be able to complete the mission of responsible transportation. However, after carefully studying the meaning of the above-mentioned telegram from the Ministry of Railways, it has moved from the first type of warehouse mentioned above to seeking the realization of the second type of warehouse. However, according to the needs of customers, I am afraid that they are not satisfied with the second type of warehouse, but expect the construction of the third and even fourth type of warehouses; it seems that it is easier to realize by inviting businesses and banks to invest in construction, and the railway provides freight sidings and other conveniences, and both parties fully cooperate.</p>
<p>Someone may say; Merchants have always held the principle of profit-seeking. If ordinary storage is assigned to merchants, then not only will this business be monopolized by them, but the railway may also be controlled by them. If the entire future of transportation is greatly affected as a result, it will inevitably outweigh the gains. However, this is an overestimation. The evils of monopoly are mostly the result of exclusive patents. Any business, if it has a little competition, there is no monopoly to speak of. Therefore, the railway only needs to assign the ordinary storage warehouses along the line to several banks to handle, and there will definitely be no monopoly. For the sake of simplicity, the railway can ask the banks to jointly form a banking syndicate to take over the large-scale warehouses needed along the line, which is easier to realize; since banks have become a group under this kind of facility, it seems difficult to avoid monopolistic behavior; however, every business aims at profit, and operating warehouses is no exception. If the goal is profit, the higher the price, the fewer the transactions, and the lower the price, the more the transactions. This is an immutable principle in economics. Therefore, enlightened merchants will choose the price that is most attractive to transactions and can obtain the most profit as the standard. And the price that is most attractive to transactions is definitely not the highest price; if the lowest price is set to attract the most and widest transactions, it is especially a win-win situation. Moreover, each bank has its own interests and restrains each other. Therefore, even if the banking syndicate intends to monopolize the warehouse, there will not be a monopoly in fact. Otherwise, the transactions will be depressed, which is called self-defeating, and the merchants will not do this.</p>
<p>As for controlling the railway, it is even more seemingly correct but actually wrong. Since merchants build warehouses along the railway line, they need the help of the railway everywhere. Therefore, their psychology must be full of the hope that the railway will cooperate with them. How can they use this to control the railway and lead to the danger that the railway will not cooperate with them. Because the merchants' warehouses and the railway's transportation have a related relationship, only full cooperation between the two parties can achieve the goal of coexistence and mutual benefit; otherwise, both will be hurt, and merchants are well aware of the advantages and disadvantages, and will definitely not fail to see this. Then the railway's assignment of ordinary storage to merchants can lead the way for cooperation between the railway and the financial community; one day, the financial community will develop a strong interest in the railway business, and then take a step further, willing to provide the railway with various economic assistance, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>Now the Ministry of Railways is investigating and evaluating the situation of the original warehouses of the state-owned railways in various countries, the current freight transportation needs, and the entire plan for the future. Therefore, I will briefly write one or two points as far as my humble opinion can reach, to provide materials for discussion. I know that flaws and omissions are inevitable, and I hope that railway experts and enlightened people from all parties will correct them (End)</p>

<h3 id="e214">Finance: Quiet Sunday Foreign Exchange Market <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Silver Dollars Plunged, Copper Coins Rose Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, because it was Sunday and banks were closed as usual, the foreign exchange market was quiet. Only some money shops were still open as usual.

As for subsidiary coins, although small silver dollar transactions were smooth, prices fell due to remittances. Jiangnan small silver dollars once fell to 8 yuan in the morning market, to 825 yuan. Although they rebounded by 2 yuan in the afternoon market, to 837 yuan, the result was a fall of 6 yuan from the previous day.

<p>Securities Prices Rose Over the Week</p>
<p>Over the past week (October 15th to 20th), the bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange has experienced quite a storm. It has been brewing for a long time, and occasionally encounters an impact, causing turbulent waves and a boiling market. The entire Shanghai Exchange was shocked. The implementation of the silver tax suddenly came into effect. What is the relationship between this issue and the market price of public bonds? At first, it was considered ambiguous, then it was thought that the currency was cheap and things were expensive, and then there were still many misunderstandings. The market price of the exchange also fluctuated greatly, causing a great uproar. According to the silver tax, the outflow of cash will naturally decrease, or even stop because of this. People's hearts are becoming more and more excited. However, because the settlement period is approaching, the market price cannot temporarily tend to a level. Over the past week, the silver tax issue has been implemented on Monday, but the market price only rose by half a yuan at the beginning. After that, rumors rose again, and the price gradually increased, still only a small amount of 3-4 jiao. On Tuesday, although the rumors subsided, people were still uneasy, and it was slightly better by about half a yuan. On Wednesday, bulls came out, or rolled over, still a small amount of 3-4 jiao. Three days after the silver tax, the public bond market did not have any stimulation. On Thursday, due to the saying of paper currency policy, most of the Shanghai exchanges rose to the limit in the early session. The public bond price was still hovering in the early session, and began to rise wildly in the second session. The market was suddenly tense, and the popularity was extremely high, rising by 2 yuan in one day. On Friday, the large bulls came out, and most of them misunderstood the silver issue. The market price fell by about 1 yuan. On Saturday, it was heard that the Fifth Plenary Session would not be postponed, and the southwest was taken over, and the situation was very satisfactory. Hu Zhantang also had the saying of coming to Beijing, and the market price rose by about half a yuan. Judging from the recent situation, there are still many shorts in the market, and the Fifth Plenary Session will definitely be successful. In the past few weeks, there have been many people who are bearish, and the short positions have actually been quite a lot. Therefore, at this time when the settlement is approaching, the news is good, and the bond market still has a short squeeze. As a result of the market price for a week, it is estimated that the increase ranges from a few jiao to 1.67 yuan. The total number of transactions totaled 129,585,000 yuan, and 250 shares of stock. The results of its rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, various groups brought in sources of rice numbered 25 and 26 (totaling over 4,000 piculs). Brokers did not make offers due to the end of the week. Only the Qingdao group slightly handled kiln-dried seeds for one season, amounting to about 40 to 50 packages. The local market seemed to be slightly active, and the situation was still good. Coupled with the scarcity of arrivals, people's hearts were not firm, and the market rose by a few cents. Suzhou and Tongxiang groups had strong demand for thick new rice, also rising by a few cents. However, wild rice and white rice, as well as sales, remained stable. Duyang pointed rice remained high and fresh at a moderate price. Various types of broken rice did not see much gain or loss. New Yinyuan and cooked rice demand remained strong, and prices rose by another 10 to 20 cents.</p>

Sales of various goods on the market, broken rice and new rice, were not very promising in the early market, but improved in the later market. There were still no kiln-dried seeds arriving. New Du Tip, Yinyuan, and old Baiyuan had good retail demand. New and old Bu Ke Tip were also inquired about. New and old Sheep Tip were scarce and sold well. Prices for broken rice rose slightly. Prices for new rice, new sheep, Du Tip, Bai Guo, old Baiyuan, new and old Bu Ke Tip, etc., were similar to yesterday, with no significant changes.</p>

<h3 id="e219">The Tragic Fire on Avenue Edward VII <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— A Family</p>
<p>This is truly "shocking": fifteen people were burned alive in the fire all at once! According to reports, there were originally fourteen victims, but one of them was a pregnant woman, Ms. So-and-so. Counting the seven-month-old fetus, the total is indeed fifteen. In addition, there were five people with burns. And they, both men and women, were all "one family"! Although they had different surnames and included eight (plus the "subletter"). The front building, the back building, the attic, the front and back annexes, the kitchen, the drying platform, etc., with men, women, the old, and the young, totaling nineteen people, but they were all living together in a two-story, single-family market building. Thus, such a major tragedy unfolded in an instant!</p>
<p>However, the fact that such a small house was packed to the brim shows the "prosperity" and "population density" of Shanghai, doesn't it? Indeed, this place can be called the "New York of the East"! According to a recent report published by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, the total investment in construction in the Public Concession and the French Concession in the past ten years amounted to a staggering 466.7 million yuan. Last year, the number of high-rise buildings in the Public Concession increased by 879, and the French Concession saw an even greater increase of more than 900. However, the fact that nearly thirty people lived in one single-family house truly demonstrates the "flourishing" state of this "New York of the East," doesn't it? But on the other hand, if we pay closer attention, we will be somewhat disappointed. According to the statistics of the Finance Department of the Public Concession Bureau, the number of vacant houses in the Public Concession alone is as high as 5,383. In the same period of the twenty-first year, it was 4,687. If we add the vacant houses in the French Concession and the South City, the number would probably be no less than ten thousand!</p>
<p>In such a comparison, we must realize that, on the one hand, in today's cities, investment in construction and real estate remains one of the good business sectors for entrepreneurs. However, on the other hand, due to external multi-faceted aggression by various capitalist imperialists and the impact of the "world economic panic," and internal rural economic bankruptcy, market decline, and various "recession" phenomena, the trend is only becoming more widespread and profound. Thus, high-rise empty buildings are allowed to increase by the thousands to show the prosperity of the "New York of the East"?</p>
<h3 id="e220">Occasional Notes from the Study <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Philosopher</p>
<p>(1) A Humble Sentiment</p>
<p>The speed of the century's progress is truly too fast. Being violently thrown onto the street corner, caught in the various problems rushing in from all directions, one only feels that they cannot even stand firm in the torrent of life, constantly surfacing in the whirlpool. Perhaps they will drown soon? Faced with the kaleidoscopic and colorful aspects of life, one is too fragile. But what can temper people into camels capable of enduring hardship and humiliation? On the one hand, it is the suffering of life, and on the other hand, isn't it those books left behind by human ancestors, books that shine with the light of wisdom? In order to make oneself stronger, one has long yearned for a simple study filled with books. This is not a luxurious hope. I don't want precious stationery or ornate bookshelves. The study I speak of is just a small room, a willow wood table, a few shelves of beloved books, a writing brush, a bottle of ink, and a few sheets of rough paper. My desires are also very humble. If I could boil a pot of coffee, light a dish of benzoin on the table, and have two hours each day without being disturbed by anything, giving me some peace to leisurely face the books, what happiness that would be! Besides the time and energy given to society, people should reserve some time and energy for themselves to enjoy. But in this cruel world, besides the time and energy consumed for life, no, I mean wasted for necessary survival, how much can be saved for oneself to do something non-professional, something one loves?</p>
<p>That tiny happiness is also taken away from us salaried workers.</p>
<p>For the past few years, my dream has been to build my own little world in this vast world, to build a study. Truly a pitiful animal without the ability to control one's own life as one wishes. Constant effort has only resulted in an old table and half a shelf of miscellaneous old books, with a bit of everything. I am actually satisfied with these things, if only I could sit at the table and, of my own will, flip through this book, move that book. Although it is such an easy thing to do, it has not been done yet. Only on the road, on the bus, while rushing around for food and clothing, can I snatch some time to hastily read some books.</p>
<p>Because of this, I have a cursing attitude towards life. The two hours spent in the study should always be given to me.</p>
<p>It's not just my situation that's like this. There are many, many people like me in the group around me, even some who are worse off than me. Only my friend So-and-so is an exception. He is a bachelor. In his residence, unlike others, he turned a small room of less than one square zhang into a bedroom, while he turned a spacious and bright room into a exquisite study. This is probably because he is an intellectual. Every time I walk into his study, see the walls filled with books, and stand in front of the bookshelf, flipping through the books one by one, feelings of envy always involuntarily surge up. When I sit down on the sofa next to the desk, holding that crystal lion-shaped paperweight in my hand and playing with it, my friend will smile triumphantly.</p>
<p>What can be done about such a smile? One can only sigh helplessly from the bottom of one's heart. Then my friend, as usual——</p>
<p>"I've poured all my heart and soul and income into this over the years!" He would begin by saying such things, then go on to talk in detail about how he bought Joyce's Ulysses from an old bookstore for seventy cents, how he saved half a month's transportation money for that hardcover, and so on.</p>
<p>He has already told such stories in front of me five or six times, but every time I step into his study, he never tires of repeating them. Even if I have heard it a hundred times, I can still find new interest and new joy in this old story.</p>

<p>Pleasure. Returning home and seeing my own dilapidated desk and dust-covered books, I always rekindle my ambition to build a study, and at the same time:</p>
<p>"When will I be able to sit at the desk and quietly hold the book in my heart?" I lament in this way, and this will probably become a lifelong sentiment.</p>
<h3 id="e222">To a Village Friend <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Lie</p>
<p>Although I have been in Shanghai for a full seven years, if you suddenly ask me, "What is Shanghai really like?" I would be at a loss for words. This is why I have had your letter for two weeks and have left it on my desk without replying. Today, after the heavy rain, I stood by the window, looking at the flying clouds and thinking of old friends. Then, I felt guilty for not replying to my friend's letter. So, I concentrated my mind and thought about the question, "What is Shanghai really like?" over and over again for twenty-eight minutes and five seconds, but I still cannot give a correct and definite answer.</p>
<p>Is Shanghai good? I dare not readily affirm. Is Shanghai bad? I also disagree by more than sixty percent. Shanghai, as I see it, is truly full of the flavor of dissecting phenomena using dialectics. What does this mean? We know that Shanghai is a gathering place for the unemployed, but there are also many job opportunities. Shanghai can force people to death, but it can also save people. There is a dark side, and there is also a bright side. There are bad people, and there are also good people. This is my understanding of Shanghai over the past seven years, and it can be considered a general critique of it.</p>
<p>You also ask, "Can I come to Shanghai? If I come, can I avoid starvation?" I can only give a humorous answer, "Starving is up to you, not starving is also up to you."</p>
<p>From one perspective, Shanghai is a professional looting field watched by all eyes. You rob me and I rob you, but it is all for the sake of "too many monks, too little gruel" and "too many people for the available positions." Thus, bit by bit, yesterday one, today two, either jumping into the Huangpu River, or committing suicide by poisoning, or... although the ways of dying are inconsistent, the numbers are extremely alarming. These suicides are, of course, a blatant explanation of why Shanghai is Shanghai. Secondly, there are still many people whose life force has not yet been cut off, struggling in the extreme pain of unemployment, craning their necks and reaching their heads, never finding a single job all year round, never getting a scoop of porridge all day long. Thus, beggars are everywhere, and the starving fill the roads, not dying by suicide, but dying by starvation.</p>
<p>Another way of saying it is that Shanghai is also a living Shanghai. As long as a person has a skill and encounters an opportunity, they can live very well. And sometimes they can even rise to prominence, dominating one side. Looking back, people like Hartung, Ye Chengzhong, and more recently So-and-so and XX, all rose up in Shanghai with their bare hands. Naturally, there are also powerful people who value you, support you, so that you don't starve, don't lose your job, and can live and develop. Looking back, there are also many people who pick up cigarette butts or find a living in the garbage dump. As for those hooligans and bums, they can also live their days comfortably. In short, Shanghai is very livable. Even if you are unemployed, it is still very livable. If you are healthy and encounter some opportunities, it is even easier to live.</p>
<p>As I see it, Shanghai is such a Shanghai. Are you coming? I won't stop you. Are you not coming? I won't urge you either.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Sick <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Menglan</p>
<p>The sicker, the poorer,</p>
<p>The poorer, the sicker,</p>
<p>Sick and poor, poor and sick.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>I wrote such a short poem three years ago, and now, lying on my sickbed, I think of it again.</p>
<p>I never thought that although three years have flown by, everything is still the same. The so-called progress is probably just that poverty and illness are progressing, right?</p>
<p>What will it be like after three more years? I dare not think about it anymore. But on the sickbed, when tossing and turning sleeplessly, such thoughts inevitably turn cold again.</p>
<p>For poor fellows like us who work all day to eat three meals, we can barely cope when we are as strong as oxen. But once we get sick, not to mention that we have to scrape together medical expenses, we also have to find a way to fill this stomach. Therefore, while drinking the bitter medicine, I worry about when I will be able to repay this debt.</p>
<p>I have friends, and indeed many friends who are willing to help financially. However, there are not many wealthy friends. Those who are have long gone to enjoy wealth and glory and make friends with other wealthy people. Those who are left and willing to help financially are only friends who are as poor as I am, eating today's meal and having to prepare for where the money for tomorrow's meal will come from.</p>
<p>When sick, emotions become abnormally fragile, very easily angered, and often inexplicably bursting into tears. But for some reason, one feels that everything is meaningless, unwilling to drink medicine, just quietly waiting to taste the flavor of death. But when one discovers that there are only a few copper coins left in the drawer, and one has to pick out clothes that are not needed for the time being from the box to exchange for money, one has to sit up and pick up a pen to write black characters on white paper.</p>
<p>When emotions fluctuate more unpredictably than autumn clouds, the first to bear the brunt is naturally the wife. Some extremely minor disagreements will provoke my inexplicable anger. The wife, in such a situation, does not resist, nor does she answer, but, like a captured prisoner, bows her head and says nothing, or turns her back and secretly wipes away her tears with a handkerchief. When my anger subsides, she quietly sits by the bed, thinking absentmindedly, or staring absently at the autumn clouds outside the window. Afterwards, when her emotions have calmed down, she leans close to my ear and asks, "What do you want to eat? You!"</p>
<p>At the same time, she reaches into the drawer to count her money. When the wife's back disappears before my eyes, I often feel inexplicably lost.</p>

<p>Shanghai is worthy of being the largest metropolis in East Asia, with British territory, French territory, and Chinese territory. Twenty-four-story buildings pierce the gray sky. The "Full" sign is always hanging in front of the hotels. Jai alai, dog racing, banknotes turn into colored paper and flutter in the air. And! Do you know? The stage of 1935 will be crowned on an auspicious day!</p>
<p>And? Of course there is! The fire on Avenue Edward VII; the collapse of the Shanghai Industrial Bank!</p>
<p>This is heaven above hell!</p>
<p>The rural economy is bankrupt. In years of great harvest, grains are worthless; in years of great drought, the fields are full of rice stalks. The rent still has to be paid. So, dreaming of gold, they shoulder their baggage, step onto the ship, and bring their fate to the metropolis to seek a final verdict.</p>
<p>The recommendation shops are crowded with people. The factories are crowded with people. People, people, people are everywhere, forming this metropolis of three million people.</p>
<p>A well-dressed fat man walks out of a foreign-style house, holding a cigar, and is squeezed into a car by a tall White Russian, "beep beep"... the life of heaven!</p>
<p>Pale pink, pale green lights, women embracing snakes are intoxicated in the atmosphere of champagne, smiles swirling on everyone's faces, the life of heaven!</p>
<p>But who goes to hell?</p>
<p>The docks and stations are constantly sending off crowds of people with foreign accents, one, five, one hundred, one thousand, why don't they return?</p>
<p>Taking poison, throwing themselves into the river, creating materials for daily social newspapers!</p>
<p>Heaven and hell organize this largest metropolis in East Asia!</p>

<h3 id="e225">Can Patented Products Be Imitated? <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have a matter that I would like to ask for guidance. I think you are a guide for those wandering on the wrong path, and you will not refuse me.</p>
<p>I and several friends have been researching a certain machine. After years of exploration and repeated experiments, we were finally successful. Now we want to register with the government agency in order to enjoy the right of patent. However, this kind of machine is very easy to imitate. If what I have created is a round shape, others can imitate it and create one dozen, and although the brand and shape are different, the function is the same. I don't know if I have the right to interfere with him? Is there any way to prevent others from imitating it? Please reply in the newspaper as soon as possible. Respectfully, Guan Xionghui</p>
<p>Wrote with peace</p>
<p>Editor's note: If you register with the government and obtain a patent, you have the right of invention and are protected by the government, and others may not imitate it. Because what the right of invention protects is the principle of the invention, not the form of the invention. Therefore, others, such as changing the appearance and imitating it, have the right to prevent it.</p>

<p>Opening (Lament of the Autumn Window)</p>
<p>A bolt from the blue is startling. Why harbor resentment and secretly harm people? I want to comfort and gladden my parents, to live an honest, thrifty life. (Last night) an unexpected letter suddenly arrived. (Therefore) I bid farewell hastily and returned home. Hearing my mother's words, my heart nearly breaks. Though untrue, it's hard to deny the claims. I've never frequented brothels or flower-lined streets, let alone actresses and entertainers. (I am) a respectable son of a prominent Fengxi family. (How could I) abandon my integrity and embrace modernity? Our family is poor, and I had little schooling. At just thirteen, I began to learn a trade. Sadly, I learned an unrelated profession. I lack knowledge and skill. I am grateful for the recommendations of my elders. I broadcast on the radio from a middle school. A year has passed in the blink of an eye, with neither profit nor loss for the company. (I hope) to flourish and improve daily, so that one day I can establish myself and succeed. Who knew this trouble would arise out of nowhere, causing me shame before my clan? (Saying that) there is no wind, no waves, (saying that) the shrimp doesn't jump, the water doesn't move, I will never be able to clear my name. I want to throw myself into the Pu River as a water ghost, but I have yet to repay my parents' nurturing kindness.</p>

Then, weeping, they part ways!</p>
<p>The murder case at Nengren Temple is indeed discovered. The local magistrate, originally a sesame paste official, encountering such an unprecedented case, is bound to make many jokes! Listen attentively!</p>

So he ran to Jia Lian to return the sword and call off the engagement! Third Sister You is puzzled, she loves him no matter what. In the end, because of this, she used the engagement mandarin duck sword to commit suicide in front of Xianglian!</p>

In desperation, he exchanged clothes with the boatman, claiming to be visiting relatives but was turned away. Coincidentally, the Hua Mansion was hiring a book boy. He was introduced to the Grand Tutor by the steward Wang Jin, sold himself as a servant, and changed his name to Hua An. From then on, the scholar became a servant.</p>
