<h3>德奥糾之剖視恒</h3>
<p>自奥總理陶爾婓斯被刺而後。國際空氣。極度動盪世皇皇。一若二次大戰之禍。已逼於眉睫也者。誠以此一事件之幕後牵線者。厥爲德國。而蒙其影響者。則爲中歐之均勢。關係重大。逈而一國單純之内争可比。是以意大利有軍事行動之準備。英法各國亦皆密切注視之也。然謂歐洲卽有戰禍之爆發。似尙言之過早蓋此事之主動雖皆謂爲與德有關然戰與不戰炎關鍵。在於德國之態度。苟德國而欲戰。則乘亂干涉奥政。戰事可以立起。反之德國而猶知顧忌。卽可使緊張之空氣爲之和緩。吾人先從國　際形势上觀察。卽知德國無速戰之可能。今日國際形势之不利於德。人所共知。在德波未訂不侵條約之先。忌德者。不過法國與小恊約而已。此約旣成。俄人亦随之而增强其反德心理。最近英法固已恊調。意大利亦顯然變態。日前波蘭艦隊訪俄。大受歡迎。足見俄波亦之傾向。德國處此四面皆敵之環境中。卽令已逹戰前之富强。亦可斷其不敢再蹈卽往之覆轍。而遽爾挑　也。再觀德國國内之經濟狀况。亦可决其未足以言戰。蓋德自希脱拉主政以來。國内經濟狀况。不獨毫無進歩。抑且每况俞下。吾人略舉數端。卽可　見其民躬財盡之一斑。㈠爲二年來現金保有額之鋭减。按德國現金保有额○在一九三二年有七億九餘萬馬克至本年二月有减至一億一千餘萬馬克爲時不及二載。現金减少七倍有實開德國一九三一年濟恐慌以來未有之記錄。㈡爲國民總收入之緊縮。按一九三三年上半年國國民之總收入爲二百三十五億五千萬馬克。至下半年卽减少六億五千萬馬克今年統計。更當减少。可以預卜。㈢爲一般必需品消費量之跌落。去年糧消費較前年减少十萬萬馬克。本年情况。更見恶劣。此外如郵政收入减少一萬萬馬克。鐡路收入减少十分之二。舟車收入减少三分之一。在在反映其國民經濟之竭蹶。德國當局。苟非狂妄。何至不顧現實。而追求於戰争。德國而果出此自殺政策。恐不待决勝負於疆場。卽將爲共産黨造機會於國内。以希脱拉之熟諳國情。寗見不及此。最後就奥變發生後之德國行動觀之。更可見其有避免衝突之意。如召回駐奥大使改任巴本。電唁奥國總統。罷免奥國社黨領袖。截留謀入奥境之武裝義勇軍。皆在竭力防止事態之擴大。其無挑撥戰與勇氣。尤灼然可見。顧德國卽不能立卽作戰。何以必欲直接或間接促成此次之事變。吾人以爲個中之原因與意義。應加解釋者。蓋有數端。第一在對意大利示威。前者。希脱拉遠訪墨索里尼於威尼斯。其願甚奢。乃其結果意大利不獨未能與德切實合作。反而趨向英法而爲東歐公約張目。其給予希氏之難堪。殊非尋常。而况陶爾婓斯所以能維持其地位以至於死。亦以墨索里尼之助力爲多。意大之勢力。一日不消滅。德人在多瑙河流域。一日不能得志。因此銜恨於意。此次偕奥事以示威。自在情理之中。　　第二在轉移國人之視線。自希氏大肆屠殺之後。德國人心。迄未安定。希氏恐其再滋事端。本甚憂慮。此次因奥變而得釀成國際嚴重局面。轉移國民之視線於外。實爲希氏個人之幸事。　　故歸納言之。此次奥變影響於德國内政者。正不下於其外交。惟希脱拉困於實力。在今日未必有急遽合併奥國之决心故亦甚鮮立卽引起國際戰争之可能。唯世人卽多不直國社黨之所爲。德國必愈將陷於孤立之窘境。是則可以逆料者也。</p>

<h3>德反奥適可而止歐洲局勢和緩</h3>
<p>巴本任駐奥專使哈璧赫下令免職　　意軍雲邊境英法守沉默　　（柏林）希特勒總理今日特任副總理巴本爲駐奥專使、原任駐奥公使萊資、已於昨日召回、查巴本係前任德國總理、現在被派駐奥、則因召回萊資而發生緊張狀態、當可稍爲和緩、據稱、巴本駐奥、係屬暫時性質、惟爲期幾時未會宣布、現巴本已辭去副總理及薩爾區專員之職、政府昨晚並發表公報、宣布國社黨駐奥監督哈璧赫已被撤職、惟公報又稱、據詳细調查、此次奥國事變、德人直接間接皆無關係、查哈璧赫近會屢次播音、作反奥宣傳、尤以今年二月十二日之對奥哀的美敦、最爲人所共知、會引起國外不少批評、哈氏於去年六月會被陶爾婓斯驅逐出奥、（二十七日國民電）</p>

<p>自奥京事變發生後、余會自倍婁脫城上書總統、不得不請求總統將現任駐奥公使萊資博士撤回、蓋萊資博士未向本國政府請訓、擅自接受奥國閣員或判徒之請求、爲變方訂結妥恊條件、予判徒以安全保證、並許其退入德國境内、萊資博士之行動、雖無絲毫存心、欲使德國干涉奥國内政、然事實上則竟使德國投入於奥國内部事變之漩渦、當知此次奥國内變與戕殺總理之企圖、爲德政府所痛心切齒、深致惋惜、此舉足使陧杌不安之歐洲政局　趨嚴重、然非吾國之過出、余是以欲就可能範圍有所貢獻、以謀大局之驰懈、尤願糾紛已久之德奥關係、得重入正常友好之途徑、余基此自的、故今將請求足下樂於接受此任務、蓋自吾儕共事内閣以來、足下向爲余所倚琵、且今猶爲余所完全倚畀、而毫無保留者也、余是以建議於與登堡總統、解除足下副總理及薩爾問題委員長之職務、遣君前赴維也納、以特使之資格、於有限之時期執行德國駐奥公使之職務、君其以此資格、直接受余節制至於足下前此致力於國家稪與事業、以及自與吾儕共事以來所效力於德意志國家者、余今特再深致感謝之忱焉」云云、（廿七日哈瓦斯斠）</p>
<h3>巴本使奥德國具有作用</h3>
<p>調虎離山使保其政治聲望</p>
<p>並藉此表示不欲增重奥亂</p>
<p>巴黎人士始終抱懷疑</p>
<p>（柏林）希特勒總理任命副總理巴本爲特使、以代駐奥公使萊資之職、據一般人解釋、謂希特勒此舉、其作用不外二端、一方面使巴本脫離内閣、而不使其政治聲望完全受損、另一方面、更可藉此明白表示德國對於維也納事變之立塲、按巴本在内閣與宣傳部長戈培爾常多齟　、至六月三十日事變發生一星期以前、巴本在瑪爾堡大學演說、批評德國内政、至此巴本與戈培爾之銜突愈形明顯、巴本在内閣中之地位頗爲不穏、迨七月一日巴本被捕、爲普鲁士總理人特務警察隊所監視、於是巴本地位愈見動揺、但嗣</p>
<p>後六月三十日事變中被殺之巴本屬員波斯舉殯時、巴本會發表演說、由此可見巴本在國内地位之微弱、不如外間所推測之甚、此次希特勒乘機命巴本出國、殆亦調虎離山之計也、此外巴本并非國社黨嫡派分子、此次出使奥國、可藉以表示德國對奥國事變態度之緩和、一般人因此頗視爲吉兆云、、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）　　（柏林）副總理巴本任爲特使、以繼駐奥公使萊資之後、一般人互相訽問、巴本此行究有何種任務、而按照向例、駐外使節係由外交部指揮、何以巴本獨受任於希特勒總理、或以爲柏林當局自知失敗、乃以圓通著名之巴本擔任使節、藉以緩和人心、吾人猶　前此薩爾區域國社黨因暴行滋事、致被解散、巴本乃銜命前往、卒能創立德國陣綫以代之、此次巴本赴奥、其銜有相類似之使命歟、未可知也、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德報轉變論調</h3>
<p>極力洗刷助長奥亂嫌疑</p>
<p>駐使行動應由個人負責</p>
<p>（柏林）維也納政變後、德國報紙已一致向内亂頻仍之奥國人民表示同情、惟否認外國報紙所載德國頗有參加嫌疑之說、德意志普通報會於今日社論中、提及德國駐奥公使顯然袒護奥國叛徒之行爲、致使外國報紙認維也納事變、德政府實應負責、惟該報稱、現該公使已被召回國、此足證明彼之行動、實係其個人主張、應由其個人負責也、况該公使之行動、稪有一更合乎人道之目的、卽欲藉以免除更大之流血、而促成被拘各閣員之釋放是也、如奥國報紙欲藉此事、以號召他國之聯合反德、則殊不知政變危急之中、卽奥國閣員亦將除德國公使舘外更無匿避之所也、柏林日報引證德國政府於維也納事變發生後、卽立行禁阻德奥間之交通、而奥國衝鋒隊團員則始終留居德境、距離邊界百哩之外、足證德國已竭力阻止事變之擴大也云云、地方指示報則謂［奥國流血事件、在德國全境自然引起强烈之同情、而陶爾婓斯總理之慘死、尤令人惋惜］云云、此足代表一般普通論調、（二十六日民電）rv</p>
<h3>奥國人心大慰</h3>
<p>維也納德國對奥取較前和緩之態度、且任巴本爲駐奥大使、並免奥國社黨德人領袖哈璧赫之職、凡此行動、已於奥國發生安慰之影響、而使任命新總理問題易於决定、今日德意志報特刊載有所謂希特勒和平提案、已由飛機在空散給仍在斯狄利亞省與卡林齊亞省負責嵎之叛黨、哈璧赫之免職、衆視爲德總理已委　奥國社黨之明證、據幕尼黑湔息、該處德當道現嚴加戒備、以防巴伐利亞奥國社黨之蠢動、國社黨黑衫隊五百名已奉命開往佛萊拉西格、因該地駐有奥國社黨故也、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<h3>昨日返滬</h3>

<h3>大連會談</h3>
<p>殷氏昨在輪次發表書面談話　　、其原文如下、余係廿一日乘　　大連丸赴連、本日原船回滬、　　廿三廿四兩日、與關東軍參　　謀副長岡村少將、關東軍第　　二課長喜多大佐、駐平日使館武官柴山中佐、會談二次、（每次連同共餐時間、約五六小時）、各報圴載有大連會議之消息、其實僅係散座雑談、並無會議形式、旣無議題、更無筆錄</p>
<h3>我方動議</h3>
<p>至此次會談之動議、確係出　　自我方、因上次在莫干山與　　黃委員長及關係各位商議華　　北政治時、深感在將戰區内　　各種麻煩問題、一掃而空之　　必要、故黃委員長囑余一行、[P會談内容&gt;</p>
<p>至談話内容、因在未向當局　　報告之前、尙不便表示、但此　　會見、旣係我方所邀請、則所　　談事項、當然爲我方所提出</p>
<p>可知、約言之、爲戰區内種種　　麻煩問題之清理是已、概舉其項目如下、（一）日鮮不良浪人之取締、）二（李石等部保安隊之整理、（三）新編保安隊之開入、）四（馬蘭峪東陵之接收、（五）日僞軍之撤退、）六（察東區域之整理、（七）大東公司之取締等、均一一有澈底之解决方法、雖未能完全如我期望、但確有進步、可無容疑、止須黃委員長北歸、督同地方當局確立計劃、逐步實施、則戰區糾紛、必可一掃而空、華北局面、或可小康、</p>
<h3>取消恊定</h3>
<p>取消停戰恊定問題、未正式　　談及、如果中國正式提議、彼　　方當無理由可以反對、惟此　　事應由中央通盤籌度、不容　　輕率主張、通郵問題、彼方有此提議、余以非主管人員、且未有所秉承、故未予答覆、余日内仍須赴莫干山、將此行經過詳細報告、</p>
<h3>殷氏稪職</h3>
<p>余之復職、这社先生行止而　　定、余之入局、本係客串性質　　、完全爲朋友帮忙、黃先生而　　去、則余之帮忙、總必帮眰底　　、黃先生而不去、則根本既不忙、自無所用其帮、亦卽余高唱歸去來兮時也、茶淀炸案之綫索、尙未有所聞、余認爲係倈義的愛國靑年所爲、不過未認淸題目、未選擇手段、爲遺憾耳、至防緝兇犯、乃軍警有司之責、余不預問云云、</p>
<h3>唐氏談話</h3>
<p>外次唐有壬、爲祝乃母籌辰、　　於前晨由京抵滬、昨據唐氏　　語往訪記者、殷局長（同）此　　次前往大連、與日代表會晤、　　係對戰區内一切問題、隨便商談、並無任何重要性質、關於廢除塘沽恊定問題、外電傳日方表示以承認僞國爲取消之條件、此說未免言過其詞、至平政整會黃委員長北返一節、大約須俟殷氏回滬、赴莫干山報告後之結果如何而定、屆時本人是否偕同殷氏往杭、現尙未定、再行政院汪院長擬定日内由京赴贛、係應蔣委員長之邀、前往向軍官團詶話、外傳將在廬山討論外交之說、恐非事實云、</p>
<h3>劉莪靑等抵滬促于右任返京</h3>
<p>于氏已允日内啟程</p>
<p>新新社云、監察院長于右任、來滬診視舊疾、在滬業將兩週、各方以于氏遲不返京、頗多滋疑、監察院在各委、前日上午、舉行全體談話會、當推定劉莪靑·田烔錦二委、來滬敦促于氏返京、主持院務、劉田二氏、業於前日下午、由京乘車到滬、昨晨八時一刻、特趨靜安别墅、謁見于氏、懇談逹一小時之久、聞于氏已允於今明日内卽行返京、確息、于院長養疴滬上、近已漸瘉、日内卽將返京、擬在京小住、卽行回陜、昨日本埠晚報載于氏入京將赴贛會晤蔣委員長之說、據于氏左右云、院長絶無赴贛之意、想係赴陜傳聞之誤云、</p>

<h3>各方面均認無需採購洋米</h3>
<p>湘商會來電表示反對</p>
<p>免稅提案亦難望實現</p>
<p>自因天旱米價飛漲後、米業中人、會有採購洋米、以資救濟之議、但各地得雨後、</p>
<p>米價漸平、因此購米之議、已非必要、長沙市商會、會電上海市商會、對於核免洋米進口稅、表示反對、同時據實業部消息、則免稅之舉、亦不可能、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<h3>市商會態度</h3>
<p>本市市商會、以接據</p>
<p>雑糧號業　同業公會</p>
<p>函、以米貴由於河道</p>
<p>阻滯、實際上去歲爲豐稔之年、備藏充富、足以自給、並未逹到真正缺米年荒危險地步、如果採購洋米、勢必更速農村破産、因此請轉呈黨政機關、予以制止、市商會以訂購洋米、係豆米業領袖之談話、現在各處絡續得雨、已插秧地方、似尙不難補救、且據米業表示、内地存欵、亦尙敷應用、似目前訂購洋米、並非必要、當卽根據雑糧號業來函、轉發豆米業公會、請其議復、再行核辦、</p>
<h3>長沙商會電</h3>
<p>長沙市商會、昨電中</p>
<p>海市商會云、頃據本</p>
<p>市花糧行業　同業公</p>
<p>會報稱、略以自洋米實行加徴進口稅後、國米在上海各埠、銷路稍廣、雖救濟農村經濟、尙無顯著成效、但已略呈活潑之象、乃昨接滬電、該市竟以内地旱災、米價日漲、該市所産之米、每包已逹十三元、藉維民食問題、呈請中央、核免洋米進口稅五十萬石、惟由承辦米商認繳農村復與費一元五角、卽可儘量傾銷、如果准行、爲害匪細、藉各地旱災、决非普遍、現卽以吾湘而論、濱湖各縣、素爲全省産米最富之區、現早榖已屆登塲、旱不爲虐、上海米價雖漲、至高湘米、亦不過每石九元有餘、該市少數米商、因洋米增稅、難與國産競争、致被其危詞朦聳、應請迅賜電陳、轉請否准、農商兩便、等情前來、查各地高原之區、雖呈旱象、但低窪之處、秋穫尙屬無愛、將來酌盈劑虚、於民食當無影響、目前殊無核免洋米進口稅之必要、否則救濟農村、行將前功盡棄、務希一致主張、是所至盼、長沙市商會叩、效印、</p>
<h3>實業部表示</h3>
<p>據新聲社探悉、實業</p>
<p>部對於農村復與委</p>
<p>員會專門委員顧韾</p>
<p>一提議、免稅採辦洋米七十五萬擔、每擔收公益費一元、作爲連銷局經費案、經賦稅司審查結果、當以原則上尙有商洽之點、（一）海關稅收、不能指定辦理何種事業、（二）如果要免稅、須普遍免稅、不能指定某一部份進口免稅、（三）調百存米很多、（四）如上海缺米、應儘先向國内採辦、且事實上購進市價與售出市價、如何平衡訂定、尤有關係、如爲平糶起見、卽少於原購價、損失亦在所不免、但此刻尙非其時、基於上述種種理由、此案未能通過、且洋米進口稅施行雖未久、但制度確立、不容有所變更、我國洋米進口稅制度、係採所謂滑標制度、在我國關稅自主後、第一次採用此種方式、孔部長對於此稅施行、極爲注意、隨時飭知稅則研究委員會、加以研究、當立法院通過稅法之時、尙祇有滑準精神、而無滑準形式、因完全滑準稅制、最高徴收若干、最低徴收若干之間、必須分級、例如某一種物品、採用滑準稅制、在某種市價時、應用第幾級稅則、在我國現在洋米進口稅滑準制度、祇有最高最低之限度、尙未分級、惟近來研究結果、大概本國米價漲到十三元以上、卽可免去進口稅、同時高司長聲明、（此十三元以上）數字、並非準確、不過大約情形、至確數則應以研究發表者爲準云、</p>

<h3>科學造雨與設壇求雨）續（</h3>
<p>—答朱明君—</p>
<p>現在談一談科學造雨的原理。</p>
<p>雨的成因，有由於空氣中的水蒸氣之凝結。空氣中是無時無地不包含着水蒸氣的，但在一定的温度裏，只能包含一定量的水蒸氣，超過了這個量的限度，水蒸氣便有凝結的可能。温度愈高，則所能包含的水蒸氣也愈多。例如在攝氏表十度時，每一立方粎的空氣裏最大限度只能包着九·三六克重的水蒸氣，在二十度時就能包含一七·一五克的水蒸氣。水蒸氣逹到了這最大限度時、就稱爲「飽和濕氣」，濕氣超過了飽和狀態、便可以凝結成霧。雲就是霧的一種，天空中的雲很濃密時，就表示天空中的水蒸氣已有了大量的凝結，結果自然就變成雨落下。</p>
<p>普通近地面的空氣温度總是比高空中的空氣温度較高一點。因此地面空氣中所能包含的水蒸氣比高空中的空氣更多。在地面上未逹到飽和狀態的空氣温度，若升到高空中去、就會隨着温度的下降而成爲飽和狀態、於是就在高空中凝結成雲。在今年這樣特别炎熱的天氣裏，高空中的温度也不會怎樣低、因此水蒸氣的凝結也比較困難，於是雲雨都非常稀少而造成了目前的旱災的景象。</p>
<p>這樣，科學造雨的原理不外這樣的兩個要點··第一，要使高空中的濕氣飽和，第二，要使這飽和的濕氣凝結起來，這原理，說起來倒很簡單，做起來却不容易。因爲造雨必須大量製造，也就是必須要能够影響高空中很廣大的範圍，這樣的方法是很不容易的，美國以前會用飛機散佈荷電的沙而成功了造雨的目的、但也是因爲所能影響的範圍不大，仍不適於實用。現在蘇聯的方法能在一平方粁的面積上降雨至四十五分鐘之久，這比較美國的方法已進步的多了。但據說費用很貴、，所以還有改良的餘地。</p>
<p>蘇聯的造雨法，並没有詳細公佈，甩以我們也不知道他們技術上的究竟，但原理却决不會與我們所說的不同。據報上所載，是用化學的方法散佈一種特别氣體，其目的就在促進高空中的濕氣使成爲飽和狀態。此外還施行强烈的放電。施行放電的目的是在於要使飽和了的濕氣很快地凝結起來，因爲空氣中的濕氣，即使超過了飽和狀態，若不是觸到一種固體或受着一種振蕩的力量，一時還是不會自已凝結的。美國的散布沙粒，蘇聯的放電，都是在這樣的意味上施行的。還有，放電時必有大量的電子通過空間、而飽和水蒸氣又有一種特性··即在電子所通過的路道周圍，其凝結的速度也最快，所以荷電的沙與放電的作用都是能促進凝結的。近幾年來，科學家利用水蒸氣在電子的周圍首鸹凝結的特性，能够用攝影機的電子的連動形狀拍成照片。使那非常微細而無論如何也看不見的電粒子竟給人看見了。這證實了Ｅngels所謂的··科學進步能使「物自體」一變而爲「爲人類的物」，這就是說，科學的實踐使人類的認識能力加深，原來是物質自身内部潛藏着的東西（即物自體），因了科學的原故，竟在人類的眼闪妥露出真面目而受人類的支配了。（完）</p>

<h3>暑天的恩物</h3>
<p>— 南宮</p>
<p>今年的夏季，熱度之高，爲六十年未有。馬路上的柏油，差不多都溶成了流質。火傘般的　陽，懸在當空，　得街上的行人，没一個不汗下如雨，濕透了衣衫。便是在房屋之内，被熱浪所侵襲，不論什麽東西，都似泡在沸水之中，燙得不能安身。這般的暑天，什麽冰淇淋咧，冰汽水咧，冰鮮橘水咧，冰西瓜咧、都成了唯一的却暑妙品了。可是一般人只知道到了盛夏，冰是一種可暑天恩物，對於冰的來源，却都不十分明瞭。</p>
<p>如今在市上交易的冰，一共有兩種··一種是造冰，一種是天然冰。人造冰是用了製冰的機械，取了蒸溜水，通了電氣。由冷氣把蒸溜水凝結成冰，所以潔白乾净，透明整齊，可以取來作爲飲料，似冰水，刨冰等一類東西，因冰的成分，是蒸溜水，很合於衛生，飲後不致發生疾病，是一種作飲料的冰塊，只是因了製造的時候，須用機械電氣人工，成本自然不輕，所以比了天然冰，要貴上幾倍，貧苦的人家，便不容易得到，因此人造冰便成摩登而高貴的用品。</p>
<p>天然冰的來源，却是在隆多嚴寒結冰的時候、用人敲碎了齊集在一處，藏在冰房裏面，不使它溶化，到了夏季，再由冰房内取出應用。冬水河内結成的冰，是天然的出産物，不須資本之購辦。只要造一個冰房好了，所以成本很輕，但是從河内取起，自然不合於衛生，貨價雖廉，不能作爲飲料，只可用做冰凍東西，尋常冰箱内所用的冰，都是這種天然冰。形狀雑碎不堪，而且有許多污泥夾在裏面，遠不如人造冰的好看鮮明。不過夏季把它作爲冰凍食物，用處却比了人造冰大得多咧。</p>
<p>冰房的製造，是在地上挖一個丈多深的土窖，上面四周用一尺多厚的草皮。造成了一大間房屋，到了冬天，把冰取來藏在窖中，因了四周的草皮，不通空氣，熱度侵不到裏面、太陽晒不到房内，所以過了一年半載，所藏的冰，不會溶化，依然是藏進去時的光景，熱天可以取出來應用。</p>
<p>在以前人造冰没有發明之前、夏季市上只有天然冰，没有人造冰發見。所以每一處城鎭，總得見有一兩處的冰房造在　野之中。到了如今，非惟人造冰漸漸的侵佔了天然冰地位，又有什麽冷氣間的設備，怕再過幾年，這天然冰逐漸的淘汰，不再見於市上了。</p>
<h3>凉風洞</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>在下的故鄉│諸暨│自杭江路通車後，交通便利。於是有幾個墊伏不聞的風景區··如五洩等處，漸漸爲他省人士所欣慕而游賞。但尙有一個小小的避暑之地，爲别處人所不及知道的。現在趁這大熱的天氣，特把它揭布出來··凡杭江旅客，如有興探幽。正不妨順道往游，領略此中奇趣咧。</p>
<p>距諸暨城約十餘公里，有外陳鎮··該處林木蔽天，風景淸幽。在溪山深處，有一洞。直徑長可五尺許，深數丈。土名呌做「凉風洞」··因爲到了夏天，洞内凉風習習。人入其中，便覺寒氣砭骨。雖在酷暑的時候，也非穿着綿衣或夾衣不可。其中岩石嶙峋，有石案石凳，可供甜息。所以每年到了夏季，約伴往遊的人們，絡繹不絶。該處鄉人在這時間，多臨時開設茶館飯店，以應旅客的需要。也有的，自已带了酒肴，以便在洞内共酌淸談，而且有涷蹄凍鷄可吃··這是預先把煮好的紅燒蹄子或鷄，带了進去。祇須經過一時許，卽可凍結。這天然的凍品，風味别饒。自然非市售的洋菜製就的凍鷄等，所可比擬了。所以有人說··像莫干山牯嶺等避暑的所在，氣候雖凉，究没有吃凍蹄凍鷄的程度。這一件事，是値得人們欣賞而嘖嘖稱奇啊！</p>
<p>按外陳鎭，居民約三百餘户。附近村落甚多，爲杭江鐵路所經。但没有設置車站。倒是一件憾事。依在下看來··有這樣的風景線，實有增設車站，以便行旅的必要。並希望該路局，起而實行纔好。</p>
<h3>西瓜汁</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>西瓜，真是夏季裏一種消暑解渴的上品。</p>
<p>自然，現代的摩登士女，都視冰結漣，冰汽水爲恩物，一來是爲味較甜，二來是冰凉可口。其實我以爲人造的冷飲品，雖然味較甜美，但無論如何，往往是富於膩性··舌頭上總覺得黏搭搭的，遠不及西瓜的淸香鮮潔。而且人工製造的，雖然採用科學方法製造，蒸溜消毒，再由衛生當局以檢騐，但是掛一漏萬，我們實難置信，人工製造的冷飲品中，絶對不含有碍工體健康的微生物。至於西瓜，那我就敢拍着胸脯担保，因爲西瓜中所含的是西瓜中有機體所變化而成的糖質，與會經在西瓜藤中淸濾過了的水份，絶對的有益無損於人體中的任何部份的。</p>
<p>西瓜，雖然比了冷飲品爲優，但是携带不便，皮　惹壓，未免是美中不足。因此，在這裏，我有一個提議，模仿鮮橘水的辦法，榨取瓜汁，用科學方法裝入玻瓶，那麽，我想必能大受士女們的歡迎的。因爲西瓜的售價，在産區裏，是十分低廉的，用以榨汁，成本可比任何冷飲品便宜，而這東西，又是很合於一般人的口胃的，將來的銷路之廣，預卜必能凌駕一切冷飲品而上之。</p>
<p>在這提倡國貨的年頭兒，我希望實業家注意。</p>
<h3>游泳池</h3>
<p>— 顧璞</p>
<p>炎夏悄悄地來了。寒暑表升到百度以上。</p>
<p>太陽握着無上的權威，像火球般高高地懸掛在天空，自然界的一切，被它薰蒸得焦頭爛額。　　人們的衣服都浸透在汗水中，連呼吸也緊張而急促。</p>
<p>「老于··我們游泳去吧！」人問着同伴老于。</p>
<p>「好！游泳去！」</p>
<p>「我也去！」小楊附和着。</p>
<p>於是三人拿了游泳衣跳上一路公共汽車向虹口游泳池進發。</p>
<p>進門時付了游泳的代價——每人四角大洋。</p>
<p>跑進更衣室，裏面的衣报錯縱凌亂地像洗衣作一樣。</p>
<p>换上游泳衣，大家往水裏去。中外男女可擠滿了一池，會游的在台上跳下來，不會的身上套着救命圈。</p>
<p>有幾位密絲雖然不會游泳，却會坐在淺水中請人攝取幾張曲綫美的倩影。</p>
<p>累了起來臥在草地上，享受日光的按摩浴。</p>
<p>等到驕陽失去威燄，没精打彩地西墮的時候，大家换好衣服，從虹口游泳池的門裏轉了出來，带着一個凉快的心身</p>
<h3>暑天的慰安</h3>
<p>— 神妙</p>
<p>像火一般的太陽，照耀在人間，馬路上的行人僅疏疏落的，祇有幾個黃包車夫，流着　　黃豆般的汗珠尖神地拖着一輛空車，在已溶化的柏油路上，紆緩地苦痛地行走。我一　　個人安坐室中，還兀自流着汗，什麽事情都懶得做了。　　　「Ｘ先生，一封信！」我從茶役的手裏·一望那秀麗的跡，便知是我妻子的來信。在這種盛暑，與其吃十杯冰淇淋，何如得一封所渴望的來信，來得凉爽而又愉快！在這一刹那，似乎我的汗也不流了，我全神貫注着看：</p>
<p>「上星期日你關照我們說：爲了熱，不回來了，我倒也很願意，因爲這種熱天，多勞動，不免要中暑的；可是我到了那天，不知怎的，仍在痴望你的回來，我知道你趕到家中，一定很熱，特地買了幾瓶汽水，預備你趕到就吃：當我煮菜的時候，特把晚上的一次菜，盛得豐滿一些，我知道你照例是午後來的，不過這種事，伊們不知道的，恐怕給伊們笑。ＸＸ，親愛的ＸＸ，我雖　明白這種行動，終於要使我失望的呀！</p>
<p>今年的天氣，的確熱得利害，下星期日如果還是熱，我看你不要冒了熱回來了，要是中了暑熱壞了，怎麽辦呢？可是我呢，又盼望你來，盼望你來了不要再如前幾次那麽到外邊去趕，我盼望你能在家裏乘凉淸談，享享夏天的福，······」</p>
<p>這是多麽的一封感人的信呀！伊怕我在歸家的途上勞苦了熱壞；但爲了掛念，又盼望我回來，伊的措辭是進退兩難，但我的行動，却可劃一的，本星期日無論盛暑或大雨，决計歸去，並且决計聽伊的話，不再到外面去趕。</p>
<p>夫婦的和洽，確然是人生最最愉快的事，一般人都希望享受美滿人生，而不知美滿人生建築在融洩洩的家庭之上。不會治理一個家庭的，要享家庭幸福，自然是緣木求魚。在這種大熱天氣，什麽水鮮橘水都可以錢買得到，祇有一封愛妻的温存的信，是非錢買得到的，所以我在復信的時候，得意地有這麽兩名：</p>
<p>一你確然已成爲一個好妻子了，我倒還自愧怎樣勉力地方能成爲一個好丈夫呢！」</p>
<h3>書長話短</h3>

<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>夏季的食品</h3>
<p>— 吳門殺羽</p>
<p>在這亢旱而奇熱的現在，飲食尤須格外注意！一個不小心、就容容易中着疫癘，俗語說得好··「病從口入」··夏季的飲食，自不可不加以嚴重的注意！現在把關於夏季的食品，略略加以檢討。</p>
<h3>飲料</h3>
<p>在這揮汗如雨的環境中，飲料是人人最急需的食物。摩登的冷飲品，當然要推紙色冰淇濂了。可是這種冰淇濂，水汁太少，價格太昂，膩膩地委實不足解渴！解渴的飲料，當然還是鮮橘水，沙水，汽水，和冰淇濂爲上。不過這種飲料，每盃或每瓶的價目，總要在小洋二角上下，在米珠薪桂的現在，總嫌不合平民化。酸梅湯和凉粉，雖然價廉凉快，然而又大半是生水製造，不合衛生。飲料中最合衛生的，當推藥舖中出售的花露了；水旣淸潔，味亦芬芳，並且荷花露可以袪暑，蔷薇露可以開胃，金銀花露可以解毒，等等，尤非一般飲料可及，不過價格貴些。普通的飲料，仍以冷飲的靑蒿或菊花茶爲主。</p>
<h3>瓜果</h3>
<p>夏季原是瓜果豐盛的季候。瓜有西瓜，香瓜，馬鈴瓜，東瓜，絲瓜等等。西瓜是夏令袪暑妙品，甜汁旣多，在井中或冰箱中冷透以後，甜冷甘美，比任何冷飲品都要够味。絲瓜，東瓜，都是素肴佳味。東瓜煮南肉，在夏季是一味當令的佳肴；鮮而不膩，極合口味。水果在瓜之外，還有荷與桃等等，荷分花，葉，蓮子，藕四種，花瓣可炸食，鮮葉可作饌，（荷葉粉蒸鷄諸類）蓮子和藕，旣可生食，蓮子還可煮藥，藕除可製各種素饌外，切爲細絲，以糖醋拌和，亦係下酒佳味。</p>
<h3>菜肴</h3>
<p>「雷齊」雖係迷信，然而在奇熱的夏季，那肥油的大塊之肉，確有些不合胃口。夏季的菜肴，以淸潔鮮爽爲目標。素饌中的蔴姑，葷肴中的童子鷄，最爲出色當令。蔴姑可煮湯，鷄旣可淸燉，亦可紅燒，鷄丁炒靑辣茄，鷄絲拌冷粉皮，更是淸爽可口，鷄之外，鴨也是當令佳饌，蘇州松鶴樓菜館的滷鴨，祇賣六月，其味鮮嫩甜美，爲蘇州特有的佳肴。此外菜肴，以魚蝦爲主，不過在這亢旱的現在，魚蝦産量特少，價値自然也跟着飛漲，比平日貴至一倍以了。</p>
<h3>閒食</h3>
<p>這並不是瓜子等閒嗑牙的閒食，也是夏季當令的食品．像　荳湯，百合湯、扁豆糕，凉粉等類。那種閒食，市上雖都有出售，但難免　入生水，有礙衛生，所以還是自製爲佳。　荳湯和百合湯製法，祇須將　荳洗净，百合撕開，扯去尖衣，在炭爐或煤油爐子煮熱，即成。扁豆糕，將扁豆煮爛，取去豆衣，漉乾製糕，凉粉以洋菜煮烊，在冷水裏凍凝，即成。這種閒食，食時加糖，以冷吃爲宜，旣可點饑。又可作爲袪暑冷食。</p>
<h3>吃的格言</h3>
<p>「口之於味，有同啫也。」在這赤日似火，田土　坼，農夫們冒暑戽水，心如油煎的時候，殺羽輕搖浦扇，還在食譜上打算，平心而論，委實也將成爲不知柴米價的公子王孫了。苦力們粒食維艱，我却談鷄說鴨，未免自覺太無心肝！不過殺羽旣不能天天枵腹，而夏季的飲食，尤於人生有密切關係，假使人們還愛惜生命的話，夏季的飲食，不可不特别戒嚴！現在把我關於飲食的格言，寫幾條在下面，做我這篇小食譜的結束。（一）沽酒市脯不食。）二（勿食腐爛水菓。）三（賤價冷飲一槪勿食。（四）飲食宜煮沸。）五（食物須加紗罩。（六）餿腐食物勿食！</p>

<h3>超短波及短波在宇宙間發生之現象</h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>我們知道利用短波以逹遠距離是完全靠天波的。原來離地球表面八九十英里光景的地方有一個呌海代層的塌化氣體園繞着，這海氏層好像和一面鏡子反射光線一樣·某一波長以下的電波遇見他就被反射下來了，因此用短波通信便可逹較遠的距離。從幾千公尺起一直到五六公尺的電波，遇見泫氏層都發生反射。不過五公尺波長以下的電波就没有這種情形了，自五公尺以下，波長漸漸减短，海氏層的影響也就漸漸减少；一直减到二公尺以下呌做超短波的時候，海氏層就完全失其作用了。這時候的海氏層對於二公尺以下的電波不像鏡子一般有反射作用·却變成了一面没有水銀的玻璃，電波稍稍經一屈折便一直穿過去了。因此我們用超短波通訊的時候·收發兩機一定要在同一水平面上或兩機頭互相看得見。但實騐上馬可尼氏會用超短波逹到一百三十七英里的最大距離，這樣大的战離，因爲有地面曲度的存在，已經不能在同一水平面上了，那末到底是什麽原故，仍可以通訊呢？至今還未能有充分的解釋。但馬氏至少已經證實有大部份的電波已經穿過海氏層消失在宇宙之上，收得的不過是其上的一小小部份罷了。這事實最近情的比喻，就是說電波或者可以在空氣中屈折，好像夕陽剛落下地平綫後，牠的光綫經過了大氣受了屈折，我們仍舊可发看見晚霞一樣。至於大部份經過海氏層消失在宇宙中的電波到底到那裏去了呢？至今也還未有人能够解釋。超短波傳播的速率和光綫一樣，每秒鐘二八六０００英里，那未這些消失了的電波一又四分之一秒便可到逹月球，如果用超短波向金星發射，那末祇要二又三分之一分鐘垢辰光，便可到逹，不過發射這樣遠的距離當然需要相當的電力。</p>
<p>超短波在宇宙間特性至今吾人還没有充分的明白，不過在幾年以前科學家已經發現短波發射後有同「回聲」一樣的事件發生，當信號由發射機發出之後經過幾秒鐘以後又回來了，和我們在山谷裏說話發生回聲的情形一樣。這種情形科學家就假定在地球大氣之外或簡直是月球軌道以外或許另有一種電化層存在的原故，但這不過是一種假定罷了。因爲離地心幾百萬英里以外完全是真空的。不過由上述信號又回來的事實證明，在那遥遠的距離之外至少總有一層同殻一樣的跟電磁波發生影響的東西存在。這種對於超短波有反射作用的殻樣的一層，或許是由太陽磁性和地球磁性所造成的也說不定。至少其存在是由上述信號的「回聲」可以證實的。</p>
<p>上面的學說有許多科學家又覺得不切實，便又創出呌「塵子說」（“ＤuslDarＴicＬe”Ｔheory）的學說來。此說的大意是宇宙間每天産生了無數的隕石，其中有恒河沙數的比灰塵還要小用顯微鏡才看得見的隕石天天向地球襲來；同時因爲地心吸力及太陽吃力的原故，這些比灰塵還小的隕石祇得留在兩吃力大小相等的地方，形成殻樣的一層以反射超短波。</p>
<p>以上二說，以後說較爲詳盡　總而言之，超短波的研究對於將來天文學的騐的立塲上講，將來從地球到月球或竟至於從地球到行星火箭的交通也一定非靠着超短波是不行的。這雖然是一時尙不能實現的問題，但照現在的趨勢看來，這種理想的實現我們是可以斷定的。</p>
<h3>短波之射程表</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>短波電訊之射程，隨所用之波長及季節，書夜而大有不同。下表乃雅爾西愛勝利公司）Ｒ·Ｃ·Ａ·ＶictolCo·（　集其數年來關於此問題之紀錄而製成者，詳載各種不同波長之短波電訊在不同之季節及時間之射程，爲短波收發二方極有價値之參考物。</p>
<p>因短波電訊自發射機射出後，卽分爲天波及地波二部份；天波在大氣中行進，地波則依地球表面以運行：其能接收之範圍因之不同，表中之「８」表示「射程爲無限遠」，「Ｘ」表示「在普通情形下不能收聽」。</p>
<h3>一隻省電而效力良好的短波三管機</h3>
<p>— 冰一</p>
<p>業餘研究者理想中有初步短波機，要調節簡便，避免綫路複雑；要用電經濟，避免費用的過高；要用直流電源，以避免甚高迵率收聽時接入可壓的交流聲；尤其要效力良好，才不致因初試失敗而灰心。</p>
<p>作者新近裝就一具直流省電的三管短波機，收聽成績很覺滿意，較之從前所製的好得多，現在把他寫在下面，藉一般初步研究短波的業餘同志們參考。</p>
<p>此機的優點，除了省電易製外：振　穏定；　點極少：調節簡便；分佈寛闊；是最使我滿意的。</p>
<p>全機綫路如圖一·另件數値如下：</p>

<p>ＲＦＣ三隻均爲短波用高週率阻流圈應用潛佈電容量極小者。自製用半徑木棍上，做三個槽長２／８吋，用Ｎ０３８雙絲包綫順次繞滿之。ＲＦＣ２及ＲＦＣ３亦可亦半吋徑紙管上）用蠟浸透（用３８號綫繞２吋長以備應用。</p>

<p>電源接頭不用接綫柱，用一隻五脚燈座及五脚撲落一隻。</p>
<p>綫圈用五個五脚插入式者，繞法如圖二。</p>

<p>回授綫圈往往不能確定是多少圈。試騐時先將Ｖ２　栅壓接在２２１／２Ｖ上，將Ｃ３旋進３／４，旋動Ｃ２，使各部份均能振盪，五個綫圈都要試過，尤其在１４０００Ｋ·Ｃ·及２８０００Ｋ·Ｃ·時，因難較多，須細心校騐。</p>

<h3>實惠的短波收音機</h3>
<p>— 潘仁榮</p>
<p>就一般趨熱觀來，今年似乎是無綫電的短波年，所以在這時裝一實惠的短波機也很饒興味的，這機極符合經濟簡單的條件，裝得好，能收聽蘇俄莫斯科伯力以及英國等處電台，波長自十八至百九十公尺，如收廣播带時（２８０│５５０Ｍ），當然須另備一二付插入綫圈。</p>
<p>全機各部請參閱附圖，因短波機人體感應較甚，故最佳裝在金屬如鋁質之板内，某大小面板５１／２Ｘ７，底板９１／２Ｘ９，每一波長带之　路與回授二圈，統繞在二吋直徑之絶綠電管上，各相战約叫分之一吋，回授　可以有些出入，初試時請接上二十二個半弗打之乙電，以恰起振盪爲度，繞後逐一牢裝於燈脚管上，市上也有專作此用的可購，但此法則比較省費，總計五付，收聽某一波带時，卽把某一带那付插入增减檢波乙電壓的電阻Ｒ２，這是司回授作用的，省掉時須得把了改作活動的以代之，不過終究不及前法的稳定，調節周禒的Ｃ３約１００ＭＭfd，其容量愈小則電台愈不易错過，又置備一微動轉盤，這裏也是必要的，綫圈設計如後表。</p>

<h3>選擇性問題（續元）</h3>
<p>）</p>
<p>— 江之蕃</p>
<p>（二）配諸綫圈短波配諧時，選擇性不佳，由於配諧綫圈　佈電容量之結果者，　佔百分之七十。綫圈潛佈電容量與，綫圈之形狀，圈數，及導綫之粗細，皆生關係。蛛網板繞成綫圈，潛佈電容量頗大，圓筒較小　　繞者，潛佈電容量最大，平繞者次之；間隔繞者最小。又圓筒形綫圈之直徑小者，潛佈電容量小，大者反之。故其直徑以二吋半以下爲宜，但又不得小於一吋。再綫圈之長，與其直徑，成一比例，潛佈電容量最小，磁塲亦小，不易受外界感應。導綫以二十四號至三十號雙絲或雙紗包，較爲合用。）</p>
<p>（三）其他種種　凡枝路電容器，阻流圈，無非用作濾波；簡接實與配諧電路串連或並連。其容量在可能範圍内，以愈大愈佳。因愈大影響愈小。枝路電容器應用Ｏ，一兆分法拉特左右，阻流圈大約爲八個千分享利，且皆非上乘不可。</p>
<p>丙　結論</p>
<p>由上可知，配諧週率，並非一簡單之關係如</p>
<p>而爲</p>
<p>鄙人根據此點，依第二圈綫路，製成一機，選擇性不下於超外差式者。Ｃ２用三ＯＯ兆兆分法拉特直綫電容量式者。Ｃ１用五Ｏ兆兆分法拉特。所異者，爲綫圈之設計而已。</p>
<p>綫圈係用二吋直徑之彫有多數空槽樛木筒製成。先用間隔繞法繞二十五圈，此處抽出一頭；自二十五圈至五十圈，用平繞法，每五圈一抽頭。自五十圈至八十圈，每十圈一抽頭，亦用平繞法，綫圈計長二吋，美國標準二十六號雙絲包綫繞。塗以綿膠。波長範圍自一百八十公尺至六百公尺。</p>
<p>交通部整理廣播電台以來，週率相差最低額爲二十Ｋ·Ｃ·如收音機綫路及　造能設法改良，不泥於歐美成例，雖簡單綫路，亦能予我人以滿意之成續；業餘研究家，其注意及之！</p>

<h3>苦渡</h3>
<p>— 濟羣</p>
<p>海心裏，老早就聽到了│有一塊淸絶幽静的島嶼，所以早飯剛才用完，就去邀集了幾個朋友，跑到海岸去僱了一條船兒，打算前去逛一逛牠。</p>
<p>當我們登船的時候，天空佈着幾塊龐大的黑雲，很想下雨似的，然而，想下的雨，總還没有落將下來，而我們想逛那塊島嶼，又是想得太久了，於是在船上坐定之後，不顧一切，隨卽就揮着舟子，解纜開行。</p>
<p>船兒行去了整個的鐘頭，風平浪静，倒也安然：可是多行了半個鐘頭的樣子，就不同了，天上的雨落下來了，由下雨而至於風狂，由風狂而至於雨暴，由雨暴而至於波濤洶湧，由波濤洶湧而至於我們的危險萬分。</p>
<p>當我們在那危險的當兒，有幾们朋友，爲了洶湧的波濤，恫嚇得萌了退意，提議把船兒倒駛回去，那時候，我問一問舟子，這裏距離那島嶼，還有多少遠？舟子說，快了，一箭之地了，我聽了，隨卽就對我的朋友說，我們危險已然是危險，倒駛回去總是危險的，這裏距離那島嶼不遠了，我們不若破浪前行。我這幾名話兒，竟然能够把他們的畏意打消，旋又鼓起他的勇氣，一再和狠惡的波濤搏鬧下去了。</p>
<p>我們和那很惡的波濤，實在苦戰了好久，後來風也停了，雨也歇了，太陽也從雲縫間爬出來了，就良惡的波濤，也好像爲了我們不屈不撓的精神所克伏，暫暫地平静下去了，而我們的一條船兒，這時候│也就從危險中吐了出來，逹到我們的目的地了。</p>
<p>「朋友們│看呀，這是何等淸絶的樂園呢。」</p>
<p>「是，這是我們非苦渡得不到的樂園呵。」</p>
<p>刹那間，那淸絶幽静的島嶼，已充滿着這樣狂歡的呼聲。</p>

<h3>文學洩悶論（下）</h3>
<p>— 陳友琴</p>
<p>第三是冷雋：關於冷雋的洩悶法，我們只要舉出幾個代人洩悶的例證就行子。</p>
<p>（一）魏徴的故事唐太宗的皇后死了，他悲傷的了不得，浪費金錢，鋪張營葬，陵墓之闊綽，古無以比。一天，太宗約魏徴共層觀，以望昭陵。）即太宗的皇后之陵（太宗指昭陵給他看。魏徴假裝看不見，說道：「老臣的眼睛昏花了，看不見哩！」太宗說：「囉！那不是嗎！」</p>
<p>「那是昭陵麽？」魏徴又問。</p>
<p>「是的！」太宗很得意的答應着。</p>
<p>「老臣還以爲陛下在這裏望獻陵哩！（獻陵是太宗的父親和母親的陵墓，這時業已毁壞不修了。）至於昭陵，老臣早不看見了！」魏徴淡淡地回答了這兩句，不料竟使得太宗慚感起來，立刻毁了望昭陵的層觀，而去修築獻陵。</p>
<p>魏徴是會說冷雋話，替在地下的高祖，深深地洩了一口悶氣。</p>
<p>（二）（東方朔的故事漢武帝的乳母，得了罪，應該處以謫邊形，乳母求救於東方朔。朔道：「這是不可以口舌去争的，但有一法，明天在帝前，當執法人得帝命拉你去的時候，你必須再四回顧，目不轉睛的注視着帝面，不必發言，到那時我自有主意。」第二天武帝審問乳母，東方朔亦在一傍，乳母臨去，照東方朔的話，直視着武帝不轉瞬。東方朔冷冷地雋說着道：「你這笨傢伙！還不快去嗎？難道皇帝現在還記得你哺乳時的舊情嗎？」這樣一提，竟呌武帝立刻動了舊情把乳母謫邊的命令收回了。</p>
<p>東方朔是會說冷雋話，替並未犯大罪而處謫邊形的乳母洩了一口悶氣。（這故事是根據漢書寫的，據史記滑稽列傳，說是郭舍人的故事。）</p>
<p>至於史記上還有優斾旃的故事，「如麋鹿觸寇」，「漆城蕩蕩寇來不能上」等冷雋的話，使秦始皇也回悔，並爲當時愁費用的老百姓，出了兩口悶氣！這些例證，可見其方法巧妙之一斑，若是一一列舉縷述之，未免不勝其煩了。</p>
<p>第四是憤激。這一類洩悶法，特别能普遍於文壇。受了激刺，便發憤爲詩歌作小說，以宣洩其悶氣的，自屈子之寫離騷，但丁之寫神曲，千百年以來，府出不窮的，只不過是遭一殷不平的悶氣在那兒作祟，卒能使文壇上發生千奇百怪的所謂萬丈光芒。有的爲自已而發，有的爲救世而發。</p>
<p>「已矣哉│國無人！莫我知兮，旣莫足與爲美政兮，吾將從彭咸之所居。」這是爲已兼爲世而發。「朱門酒肉臭，路有涷死骨」，「一叢深色花，十户中人賦」，都是爲世人洩悶氣的名句。今人稱之爲社會文學，其實他們做的人，原意並非如是，不過爲的物不得其平則鳴罷了。張籍野老歌云：</p>
<p>「老農家貧在山住，耕種山田三四畝。苗疏稅多不得食，輸入官倉化爲土。歲暮鋤犁傍空室，呼兒登山收橡實。西江賈客珠百斛，船中養犬常食肉。」</p>
<p>在農村日益没落商人買辦勎力更大的今日，我們是更嫌悶氣了。然而環境裏反常常使你悶在心頭有發洩不出的隠痛！</p>
<p>以上四種洩悶法都寫過了，於是我讀論語，（古之論語，非今之論語也）從論語裏尋出一段，可以兼有「諷喻」「含蓄」「冷雋」「憤激」四種妙處的：</p>
<p>長沮桀溺偶而耕，孔子過之，使子路問津焉。長沮曰：「夫執與者爲誰？」子路曰：爲孔丘。曰：是鲁孔丘與？曰「是也。」曰「是知津矣！」</p>
<p>這裏「是知津矣！」四字，旣是借津爲「喻」以「諷」，以是「含蓄」不盡：旣是「冷　」逼人，又是「憤激」多端。寥寥四字，足兼吾文中所舉出之四美，此論語之所以爲至文也。竊論語之名以名書者，實有十足的聰明。至於聽說新的論語是提倡什麽幽默文學的，可惜我根本不懂什麽呌做「幽默」！</p>
<p>「洩悶法」之文旣寫畢，有客來，見之，作色而請曰：「君之洩悶法，僅有四科，殊屬非是，應加入笑駡一科，將所謂駡喪門派與幽默派，都納到祺一科中。夫「王四駡人人不恨」，固亦有藝術價値存焉，蘇東坡「喜笑怒駡都成文章」，何嘗不重視笑駡！增笑駡科爲洩悶法之第五，何如？」予怫然不應，曰：「笑駡由他笑駡，文章我自爲之。」客納悶而去。</p>
<h3>罪惡</h3>
<p>— 慧</p>
<p>智識是否罪惡呢？智識非罪惡。階級是否罪惡呢？階級非罪惡。智識階級是否罪惡呢？——智識階級是罪惡。</p>
<p>無智識是否罪惡呢？無智識非罪惡。階級是否罪惡呢？階級非罪惡。無智識合成階級是否罪惡呢？——無智識合成階級也是罪惡。</p>
<p>這種邏輯，不但使學者不平，連流氓也抱屈的。學者的護符是智識，流氓的根據是階級。智識是武器，階級是實力。武器和實力給合，正是争生存的不二法門。</p>
<p>稍看自然界的現象，羊有羊羣，狼有狼羣，是團結的。飛雁也成羣，有組織，有行伍。蜜蜂和螞蟻，更是君主專制。還有一種銜尾而游的魚，鈎上一隻，聯拖一串，好像也有組織。——罪惡呢？没有什麽罪惡的。</p>
<p>但關於人類這種「特殊的羣」，問題便不簡單了。如果一個羊羣排走一匹馬，非罪惡；如一隻羊吃掉另一隻羊，這就算罪惡了，人類的方法，是合成階級，團結力量，恃强凌弱，以衆暴寡。即以目前上海社會而論，真的有力的主子在兵艦上，是東西洋人的羣，而敝國人士的羣呢？那是一個蝦羣，准備早晚供膳的。而這蝦羣也還要生活的，又只得吞食更弱的水族。——然而，通是人類呀！這便是罪惡。</p>
<p>為什麽人們不覺得是罪惡呢？因為罪惡共通倒成為社會道德了。王莽被稱為聖人，魏忠賢各處立生祠，當時的士大夫，並非完全死去了的，那是一時代的社會道徳。</p>
<h3>捧</h3>
<p>— 溫谷</p>
<p>捧是今日人類一種重要的社會關係，也是人生不可不懂的秘訣。當我們被一個人捧的時候，至少會感到精神愉快，比熱天吃冰西瓜的味道不會差。一經許多人捧，那就不難成爲英雄，首領，政治家或學者等大人物。捧的人愈多，被捧的人地位越高，權力越大，於是名利雙收，所以没有人不歡迎受捧。</p>
<p>但是如果每個人都只想人家捧，要把人家放到脚下來捧自已，世界上不是没有捧的人了嗎？可是不然。許多人捧一個被捧的人，這種的捧法，也决不行把人捧得多高。所謂捧者，是要實塔式的，一層捧着一層，越在下面的一層越要大，那末塔尖才可以安然聳立，直上雲端。塔尖之高，固爲人人所不及，就是那直接在塔尖脚下的，也很足以自傲了。塔尖愈高，一層層也依次上升。要往上爬就要人捧，但把人家放到脚下去捧自已，却不是很容易的事，所以不妨去捧人。根據一層捧一層的道理，一方面捧，自然一方面又可被捧，只要捧得牢，自已的地位就跟着所捧的人高起來。捧人與被捧，名意相反，實輒並行不悖，有一樣的功用。被捧的人以人捧而高，捧人的也靠捧人來上升，所以捧的關係能長存於社會而繼續不斷的演出。</p>

<p>—關於傳名術—</p>
<p>自由談今天登載的敦龐先生「傳名術」，文中�弟駡得已近破壞名譽，投來「關於傳名術」拙稿，千祈賜刋以作辯正幸甚。）下略（七月二十六日</p>
<p>關於傳名術</p>
<p>郭龐先生於「淸代文壇掌故雜錄」中發見了傳名術，鈔錄傳世之後大加引證，一方說出别人，一方專說自已，文章看來確有幽默之風，骨子裏却傳受了尖酸刻毒的訟典以駡人。萬幸的，我被抬舉出來，而且很露骨地似乎意在使我傳名，感激之餘，有點誠惶誠恐。按我給魯迅先生的，公開信，原信可察，出諸至誠，雖然魯迅先生於覆信中對我没有諒解，但公論自在人心；敦龐先生謂爲「挑撥」，顯屬故意誣陷，就說是「信乎拈來，涉筆成　」，事實上却真的有「挑撥」之嫌。平素未讀「淸代野史大觀」，不懂淸代文壇掌故，所以不會學及古人，而老老實實地發表惹禍的文章，引起先知先覺的襲擊；而且生性魯鈍，確無「自知之明」，誠實地發表一封信並不知竟是傳名之術。而且那一封信也並没有請魯迅先生收入文集中的懇求，更是事出意料之外。（「文化列車」的與我無關，事實俱在，有一些人指爲我的刋物，那是莫名其妙了！）然而，一個文藝作家如果不從創作方面努力，而專在寫雜文駡人以快意，或請别人將自已名字收入文集中以傳名，這一種傳名之術在敦龐先生以爲是不二法門，但在我看來實無足取。│就是因此傳名，「百年以後」，也不過是一個雜文家吧了。蒙囑傳名，大有孔老二所謂「君子疾没世而名不稱」的教訓，領教之餘，發表愚如此，不知敦龐先生以爲何如？</p>
<h3>我來自東（九）</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>我們提到了美洲，往往僅想到美國。其實在北美方面，加拿大的開闢和進步，及其人民努力之精神，更値得我們的稱贊和效法。在七十年以前，全加拿大只有三百萬人口，他的土地面積，略等於中國或美國，而他的全國人口，還比不上一個上海，或半個紐約。經過了過去數十年間的努力，土地開闢了；森林開採了，對外貿易增加了七八倍，産麥總額，增加了十六倍，礦物出産，每年値二萬萬元。現在加拿大已成爲世界第一産石棉及　鑕國家。她是世界第二産金國，第三産銀國。加拿大之人口，僅逹美國總人口十二分之一，其煤礦蘊藏之富，僅亞於美國，而爲全世界第二。因爲水利事業的發展，灌漑系統之設立，他已成世界第二的産麥國，而其麥子出口之多，爲全世界第一。在許多商港裏面，你可以看見絶大的榖倉蒙太利爾港建有四間大　倉，能存一千五百萬簍的麥子，該項榖倉，在一小時裏面，可以放出五十萬簍的麥子到火車或輪船裏，輪運出去。現在這個以産森林和麥子著名的農業國，也很快的工業化了。不過加拿大境内許多製造廠，許多是美國大公司所設的分廠。因此美國資本，暢流於加拿大市塲。</p>
<p>經濟上之互相依頼，造成加拿大和美國間政治上的微微妙關係。我這一次坐昌興公司小輪，半夜中從西雅　開到溫哥華，到岸一小時以後，加拿大的海關人員來看我的護照。他問我在這個國家已經幾年了？我說：「只有一點鐘」。他很驚奇的問我說：「你護照上，寫明的是三年啊！」我說：「我在那個國已經三年，但而到這個家國裏來，還只有一點鐘。你所問的到底是那個國家呢，還是這個國家？雖然「這個」與「那個」現在已經没有什麽分别？」於是那個人笑了。就這一件小小的事看來，可見加拿大之成爲美國大槪是不久。以後的事，不過美國國旗什麽時候會掛到加拿大來，倒是一個很有味的問題。</p>
<p>據許多明瞭國際形勢的人的話，一旦美國與日本開戰，加拿大這個小孩子，一定會投到美國母親的懷裏來的。因爲美日戰争，美國軍隊，在運輸方面，在飛行方面，一定會要假道加拿大，而加拿大保守中立，在經濟方面，美國可以致其死命，在武力方面，加拿大更没有守住那三千多哩的陸地界綫的可能。何况加拿大也不必美國來侵犯，會自動的和日本翻臉的因爲加拿大之害怕日本的程度，比美國人還要利害。如果日本佔去了亞拉斯加，或者派飛機從北太平洋方面來轟炸美國太平洋岸幾個大城，加拿大是免不了犠牲的。何况加拿大未開闢的土地，會使日本人垂涎。所以在第二次世界大戰開始之日，英國如果不聰明對付，則英帝國全部解體乃是必然的事。加拿大之離開倫敦走向華盛頓，怕是這座巨屋塌下的第一聲吧」</p>

<h3>紗花美棉跌度不及預測之巨纱花浮空起而抵補</h3>
<p>紗市轉平、因上日多頭心理、料美棉有大跌風、但來電僅小五磅音、致人心稍定、同時現紗銷路尚堪維持、因賣風减縮、午後商塲上有一部份議論、歐洲政變局勢、或不致於擴大也、因此形勢又轉平靜、</p>
<h3>金雞略升六七角</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以美棉跌度不大、塲中賣户不多、形勢平定、市盤徐徐向上、但買風亦不旺、各月微漲二三四角、午後聞奥國政事、範圍恐無大變化、浮空活動抵補、市船盤略覺緊昂、但成交數甚少、結果各月又漲二三五角、全日成交統計一萬五千六百包、查賣出大豐一千四百包、恒益三百五十包、明德七百五十包、愼記八百包、元一五百包、元泰一千包、益昶五百包、源大三百包、長豐三百五十包、買進恊成一千零五十包、賡豐五百五十包、泰興八百五十包、惠康七百包、長餘四百五十包、仁豐七百包、泰昌四百五十包、同興三百五十包、茲將一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>棉市轉漲、形勢較緊、因上日跌勢太烈、多數預料美棉有大跌之慮、今日來電微跌三至五磅音、人心安定、塲中賣户缺乏、市勢轉緊、但塲內成交數量較少、市上現棉廠銷仍滯、故新買户未見踴躍、</p>
<h3>鄭標後市回好</h3>
<p>標棉前市開盤、市氣較緊因新賣者缺乏、而美棉僅跌三至五磅音、印棉趨漲、於是上日之虚風完全消散、但塲中買户未見湧旺、各月均漲五分至一角、午後聞消息利於多頭、而明日美棉有漲風、浮空抵補、各月漲一角半至二角、全日成交統計六萬六千九百擔、查賣出源大一千一百擔、梅記一千三百擔、吉豐一千八百擔、大孚三千八百擔、大豐一千七百擔、愼記一千七百擔、長豐四千七百擔、源興昌一千二百擔、長餘一千二百擔、同和一千四百擔、長和二千九百擔、買進源大一千九百擔、大昶三千五百擔、恊生四告四百擔、信誠一千六百擔、愼昌一千三百擔、均昶一千五百擔、仁豐一千八百擔、同興一千一百擔恊成一千擔、瑞源一千一百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價錄下、</p>

<h3>美棉微跌英印俱堅</h3>
<p>昨日美棉始因棉產受損而堅、後因華爾街不振、及政治消息利於賣方而軟、結果現貨跌五磅音、期貨跌四至七磅音、英棉期貨漲一至三點、印棉市况堅穩、計平果爾漲一羅比、奥姆辣及白羅溪漲七角半、原電錄左、（二十六日電）</p>

<h3>糧食浦東新粳首批登塲</h3>
<p>—來米十一石···頃刻售盡</p>
<p>昨日東新已上市、爲今庚之第一聲、該貨由浦東周浦運申計共十一石、由新昌廠碾白出售、貨品乾潔淸凈、因係時鮮、本街店胃頗爲踴躍、競先爭辦、盛極一時、孁時脱盡、售價爲十二元、聞尚有大批在途、今日可望抵埠、收成約爲七八成、</p>
<h3>河下米市又好一二角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源十二三號、（貨約近二千石）、市况自前市轉定後、今開手形勢即見向上、如常帮蘇同南港等粳、及靑角松泗西練等晚稻行情、漸漸起升有二角之譜、一度回風、售方喊聲逐高、但作客心思又都起伏不定、致近午銷塲復呈呆木、杜洋尖及陰變元等各花色、銷路仍復有限、所賴粳貨得以站定耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源十一二號、市上各貨去胃高白粳平常、中次續化薄稻平平、早稻及羊杜尖高貨交活、客尖略動、市白粳加一二角、薄稻白元平定、早稻杜尖加二角左右、高羊尖加二三角、中次酌加客尖加近角、</p>
<h3>洋客秈突漲二角</h3>
<p>日昨客秈市面、繼續向上、開市後各囤户鑒於氣候晴旱如故、各地災象普遍、聞湖南亦遭　災、今年收成必歉、故人心更有望高之心、本街之囤積者、皆思活動、市面一哄即高、統市售開湖南靖江米機砶糙三種、合計八百五十包、漢口及沙市糙米一千四百三十一包、無緆埠秈一百四十四包、滁州機米一千六包、行情見增一角至近二角、洋米去路活絡、旣無定米軋脚、市上存底雖有五萬包以上、皆在有力帮手中執住、自然奇貨可居、非漲不可、昨因北洋帮實銷續動內地亦有指染、行情激漲二角、尚不肯多售、共開出小絞米三千包、最高價八元五角半、次至二角、照此局勢、尤恐再漲、</p>
<h3>期粉麥人氣軟化</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、均見一致平疲之锡、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、回小四五角左右不等、故開價時、人心已現鬆動、本月份因接近交割、雖北帮現貨需求、尙見活絡、惟交易所之一部套頭、以自下近遠間之差别、祇有二三分、與從前一角外之别價、以不可同　而語、故多頭放棄、人心遂見平寂、遠期亦因外行叭户减少、獲利者頻頻回出、市氣遂鬆、且以魯省得雨、組糧需要、一時可望略减、至市上所傳洋紛來華、或者須成事實、是以人心一致看平也、結是本月份較跌一分、八月份跌二分二釐半、九月份跌二分七釐半、十月份跌三分二釐半、十一月份跌二分二釐半、十二月份跌一分七釐半、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份市面、均見鬆落之象、以洋麥報價、回落四五角左右、故開價時、本月份即低開至二角六分、後復續小至二角一分、較前日收價、計落一角一分之巨、以交易所之交割貨量、受騐者占七八十車、實在可交割者、聞約二十車左右、所以人心大虚、遠期開價、亦帶落幾分、迨後本月份因不合格之交割品、自動收回、市面復振、結局抬至三角一分、祇較小一分、遠期亦同趨盤旋、後步如北路糧價轉平、恐須續小一點、結果本月份小一分、八月份小四分、九月份不動、十月份小一分、十一月不動、十二月份好一分、現麥因各廠欲殺减幾分、客户則思擯住、故無做開、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲銷絕少起色</h3>
<p>里昂華絲價跌無止境　里昂生絲市塲、因各絲織廠對於原料咸持隨用隨購之宗旨、均乏鉅額之進胃、则日絲輸入仍旺、積極廉價傾銷、致華絲價亦隨之而步跌、昨據信孚洋行接得里昂現絲價電報、滬白廠經Ａ級信昌圖牌等祇開五十六法郎半、Ｂ級三跳舞牌五十三法郎、較上週每基羅各跌一法郎半、</p>
<p>大批夏乾繭由浙運滬今歲浙屬夏蠶、受天時亢旱等影響、繭產歉折、滬埠絲繭商前往採辦夏繭者不多、類均由當地繭行收買、烘成乾繭、運滬求售、最近數日中杭紹等處由水陸兩途裝到夏乾繭共逹二千七百餘包、多數分存垃圾橋各銀行堆棧</p>
<p>綢門乘賤續購新廠經本埠洋莊絲市、因海外現絲價一再慘跌、滬埠華絲商咸起恐慌、紐約遠期十二月份絲價每磅祇開一元一角三分、（金元）、人心益虚、手中揑有存貨者、不敢堅持、於是英莊僣內地綢商咸起乘賤抛購、成交不弱、計仁記等進Ｂ級滬禾　廠經一百五十包、價益不振、</p>
<h3>華茶去化暢滯不一</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、暢滯不一、蓋現市英法各莊行家、對於屯溪歙縣等路珍眉綠茶、摩洛哥來電、頗多需要、進意依然濃厚、至婺源西北兩路之貨、其葉底與製法、雖均比較優勝嚗然因加倫方面、增加茶税之故、市面始終寂寞無神、但屯溪歙縣等路茶去路雖尚暢逹、惟售價仍趨下跌、綠茶局勢、頗呈萎靡之象、祁寗等路紅茶、上中莊</p>
<p>貨、存底已告稀少、低莊次貨、因兩湖茶生產過剩、市面亦均有跌無漲、</p>
<h3>南北貨金山枝又降三元許</h3>
<p>金山枝出新以來、到貨日增、日前所到共計一千餘箱、而日內又有二千餘箱可到、故號盤前昨兩日均開跌三四元、如較高之元枝爲三十九元、次至三十三及四元不一、高扁枝四十五元半、次至四十元左右、市勢有再鬆之可能、惟漸逹低廉地位、或能引起旺銷、泉州元紅枝及興化元香枝、下週當有見新、</p>
<h3>疋頭蓉帮採辦毛織品</h3>
<p>溽　時期、本街呢絨交易多停頓、然客埠諸申莊、則先後咸有問訊需要、因其運輸需時、適應秋銷耳、茲祥裕公·恊記興·益記·集祥諸商棧內之小川蓉帮、毛織品俱有採辦、中價廉之直　嘰花呢、元靑麥爾登平厚呢、國產駱駝絨等、均有談判成交、寳逹利元藏平厚呢　客轉　成交八箱、每碼洋一二元四角凈盤、瑞文一千三百號五箱、價計二元九角、無牌零碎薄花呢計百餘碼、價計三元一角、日貨元直貢呢某豐號開出四萬、價爲五元四角、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>辯論和謾駡</h3>
<p>— 覺</p>
<p>一宗快待解决的事件，横堅在當前，集合大家的能力，來對於事件本身做着系統的論辯，結果，眞理雖未必一定能被發見，但，對於事件的認識程度，是確保能遠進一步的。周秦時代，我國學術之所以能那様的發逹，多是由於辯論而來的。</p>
<p>謾駡，其情形有時雖也與辯論相類似，但其實質則廻然二様。當討論一問題時，如果流至於謾駡的地步，就可離開本題，像潑婦駡街一様，連對方的祖公三代也扯來駡個痛快了。這様，一來一往，就使繼續三五年下去，結果，也徒傷雙方的和氣而已，對於問題本身，是不會有多少補益的。</p>
<p>説來也够奇怪，我們的文壇，近年來發生的事件，也委實是不少，而參加討論的人，也委實是足够可觀了。但，在每一次的討論聲中，大家多是打着辯論的招牌，來互駡一通。我們如果有工夫的話，不妨拿出累次「辯論」（—）的文章，重新細心翻讀一回，是够有味兒的··我們從這裏，盡可看見許多雄糾糾的「勇士」，寗願放棄所要討論的問題的核心不管，而專在窺探對方的説話，那裏有個漏洞，那裏有個缺口，就抓着這一個弱點，大發議論，對於對方駡個狗血淋漓；甚且，還賜給他一頂金咒箍戴上，使動也不敢一動。每次的論辯，有多少是得個圓滿的收塲的？</p>
<p>本來，假使是眞的對着一個强柄的世仇，自己没力量來和他以兵勇相見，抓着機會吆叱幾聲，也的確足以消愁解憤的；仩，大家來參加討論某一問題的，其目的差不多同是企望這問題能向新的方向并展，又何苦在同路人中間，也採了這謾駡的手段呢？</p>
<p>謾駡，在我們現在的文壇上，是成爲一種最普遍的現象了。假使那一種刋物，對於某一個問題的討論，是允許繼續下去的話，一來一往，恐總只能看見互相謾駡的嘴臉吧！</p>
<p>一羣同游同玩的孩子，偶因一點小小的事體不相得，立就大駡大打起來；這些事情，在一般人的眼裏，都認爲是孩子氣，嘲笑他們的愚昧無知；但，我們現在文壇上跳跳呌呌的許多角色，與這一比，又有多少的異别呢？不過，孩子們只不曉得「謾駡是成名之妙道」這一點而已！</p>
<h3>論超然</h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>偏急與偏緩，總不易受到一班比較有身份的人所歡迎。偏急了要妨礙到他們的利益，這於他們是不利的，所以他們第一非反對不可；同時，過於滯緩了也太没勁兒，没有新鮮的玩意兒可説，這使他們也未免太寂寞，同様是不好。所以最好的辦法，是不急不緩，旣不傷害他們的身體，又不使仇們過於沉默無爲，這様，他們便有事可做了。人生便不至於太無意義。</p>
<p>旣不急，又不緩，論者稱之爲中庸</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，爲超然。超然是一班自命有身份者所最喜的。爲的是他們可以在緩與急之外，另有一個地位，自己表示没有色彩，脱出衆流之外。這是一個多麽淸高的地位呵。或急或缓，彷彿都是衆生芸芸，在那里爭權奪利，而唯有超然者可以昂首天地之外，自保淸白身子。這其實也是騙人的話兒。</p>
<p>爲着迎合上述人類的心理，所以他們常不惜明白表示，我們的態度，是不懂甚麽時代的動向，却甚相信循序改進的道理，不向古人五體投地，也不受潮流頤指氣使，不會唱響徹雲　的高調，不臭駡老福宗（封建遺毒），不專怪外國（帝國主義壓迫），只怪自己太不爭氣等等。這口氣多漂亮，身份多淸白，然而他還不過是玩那超然玩那中庸之道的一些老套。</p>
<p>超然者自以爲超然，而其實並不超過，而且也永遠不會超然。不是急，便是緩，不是左，就是右，不是前，就是後，這其間實在没有什麽另外的東西。譬如鐘擺，不是左，便是右，除是不走，停在中間的時候是没有的。就是停在中間，在中心點以左的，無論距離中心點是遠是近，總歸是左，反之，右面亦然。左右以外的地位在那里呢？實際上是没有的。然而超然者總還自以爲超然，其實却並不超然而且永遠不會超然。</p>
<p>然而超然者所以自命超然，也自有其一定的作用的。這一作用，便是用超然的態度，來欺騙不超然者。不超然者，自己很明白，世間是没有超然者地位的，不是前進，膞是後退。而超然者所以要呌他們超然，其實際的意義便是呌他們不要前進。因爲超然者其實就是反前進的。這就是超然者所以要自命超然的由來，而且也是超然者的本質。</p>
<p>烙觀的矛盾越緊張，超然者也越多。超我者自命超然，而其實却帮了不前進者的忙，作了後退者主要的支柱。然而不超然的前進者，終合以實踐來打破了這超然怕欺騙之網。同時，矛盾到最緊張點時，及前進者也會丢棄超然者的帮助，逕以不超的態度去對付另一不超然的態度的。到那時我看超然者只有走到被遺棄的地位罷。本來，不是前，就是後，中間自由者的地位是没有的。這是客觀的事實，超然儘管超然，事實上又何能逃出這個限制之外。</p>
<h3>臨時袐書</h3>
<p>— 秋</p>
<h3>阿根</h3>
<p>— 淑賢</p>
<p>這兒尋不出一片淸潔的粉牆和一個白凈的人臉，更嗅不着一點女人的粉香，馬路的兩旁零亂地站着許多破爛的茅屋，滿街滿巷都充滿了刺鼻的屎尿騷和濃烈的泥灰氣味。</p>
<p>從長瘦得可怕的工廠烟窗口吐出一線濃黑的烟霧，斜斜地流在陰沉的天空中，煤渣的小粒被曉風吹散着，細雨般灑遍了附近茅屋的屋頂和地面上。</p>
<p>嗚！嗚！嗚！工廠裏尖鋭的回聲間斷地吹了三響，高聳的鐘樓上的時鐘正指着五點。</p>
<p>「嚓」！廠前兩扇緊閉着的鐵欄門緩緩地張開了！三四個腰間佩着手槍的門警，嚴肅地分站在門的兩旁，如像一張張大着的血口中幾夥可怕的獠牙，正等候着有食物投進齒縫裏。</p>
<p>慢慢地，從那許多破爛的茅屋裏爬出了無數黃瘦陰沉的臉，生活的鞭子在每個臉的後影鞭笞着，一個個凄然投進那猙獰的血口，通過獠牙的齒縫消滅在一所龐大古舊的建築物裏。</p>
<p>鐘樓上的時鐘向前一分一分地進行着，廠前一乍小小的荒坪裏亦隨着時鐘的進展漸漸活躍起來，小販，無事的馬路英雄們，以及一部分尋找替工做的失業工人，雜亂地，囂嚷地打成了一片。</p>
<p>阿根自三月前在另一家工廠裏被裁掉以來，一個月以前就跑來這小坪裏，每天的淸早雜在那些失業的野鷄工人羣中，空着肚皮等候着找替工做。</p>
<p>「今天總有希望吧」！每當阿根跑進這小坪時，他的腦子裏立時浮現着一個莫大的希望，希望能够找至一天或者幾天替工，拿回幾角幾塊錢的工資，也可以多吃幾頓飽飯。但是事情並不和他想像的寻様如願，如今已經等候着一個多月了，替工一天都不曾臨到他的頭上。</p>
<p>「難道現在的工人一個也不生病，一天也不缺工嗎」？阿根疑惑着，兩夥睜大的眼珠，死死釘住每個進廠工作的工人，心裏感到異常的羨慕！</p>
<p>進工的時間漸漸將要過去了！阿根頽然地嘆着氣。</p>
<p>「阿根」！突然一聲尖鋭的呼喚，阿根機敏地發現鐵欄門邉站着一個大塊頭的那　　在向他招手</p>
<p>阿根搶前了兩步，從拿摩温的手裏拉過一張門票，從容踏進大門，偶然回頭看見那門外許多正注視着他的飢餓的眼晴，他垂下了頭，凄然地向那機聲軋軋的車間走去。</p>
<p>「現在的替工如何這様難找到做」？阿根一面工作着，一面掉過頭來和那左側的工人閒談着。</p>
<p>「如今的工錢减得太小，連飯都不够吃，你想除非萬不得已時，誰還願意停工」呢？</p>
<p>「難道工錢减小了連病都不生了嗎」？阿根疑惑着。</p>
<p>「病麽？除非是已經倒在床上爬不起來，只要兩條腿還能够移動得幾步，誰都還要挨進工廠來掙扎的，自己雖然生病，家裏的老小還得吃飯呀！而且現在廠方不准多停工，停工多了就有被闰開除的危險。就説做你這工作的人吧，因爲昨天被軋壞了手，今天才停工不來，説不定只過一兩天，不等痊好就會挨着痛來上工的」。</p>
<p>「唔！····」。</p>
<p>放工的回聲響了！阿根從賬房間拿到了這一天工作的工資——四角小洋和十幾枚銅板，垂着頭踏出了工廠的大門，凄凉地向那糢糊前路走去。</p>

<h3>沉痛底回憶</h3>
<p>— 比</p>
<p>天亮了，從狹小的窗品看見一些兒的曙光，我偷偷地從牆角的地板上爬起來，搓了搓麻痺酸楚的手臂，神思萬分的不淸楚，精神萎靡得不成様子，睡魔還在纏繞着我哪。我想，「再睡」會兒吧，還只五點鐘呢。」眞的，一個十四歲的孩子，一夜祇有三小時的睡眠怎麽够？昏糊的眼睛就矇朧地有些飄飄然了，但只一刹那，另一個什麽想像佔據了我的思潮，我就立刻驚醒過來，望望那橫着腿像條死猪般睡在牀上打鼾的姑，這專制底魔王啊，我便打了一個寒噤，勉强地振起精神來，抖索着一顆受了巨創的心，頭也不敢再向她望一望，並且敏捷地把條破蓆子捲起來向牆角裏一塞。</p>
<p>輕輕地打開房門走上晒臺去，旭日的紅色光芒正在凉爽的微風中從東方耀射過來，照在我的臉上，怪温和，怪舒服的，我用勁打了一個呵欠，臂腰伸了幾伸，疲乏似乎被趕走了一大半，但走起路來，兩條腿還是酸痛得像浮在雲端裏，一絲勁兒也没有，昨夜十二點鐘後無端給姑在大腿上留着的靑色的，紫色的創痕，依然鮮明地刻劃着哪。</p>
<p>我一意識到那淫威，心裏便驚悸到萬分，而這驚悸也就像善意地或是惡意地吩咐我快去把糞桶倒了，痰盂洗了，房屋打掃了，衣服凈了；還去買了小菜，洗了，燒了。然而姑，那魔王，還是橫着腿像條死猪般在那兒鼾睡着，大槪夜來她也打人打疲乏了啦。</p>
<p>大槪這已成了平凡的事了。當我蹲在一問狹小的而須容四五家人燒飯的所謂灶披間裏燒飯的時候，眼睛差不多給横衝直撞瀰漫着的紫烟薫瞎了，涙珠一陣一陣不自主地淌出來，連擦棹的工夫都不曾有，便從横地裏飛來一個凶毒沉重的耳光，接着，「賤貨，好好的有飯吃，什麽事委屈了你要在灶神菩薩面前淌眼涙，你在咒我是嗎？若弄得一家不安，你休想活命！」我的魂魄眞嚇得飛到天外去了。</p>
<p>就在那天夜裏，詬駡聲一直要到半夜裏才息，我剛合上眼睛，腿似科像毒蟲咬地疼痛，摩着盡是一塊塊隆腫着的東西，心裏眞有些像火燒一般了，我想··一童養媳是個人哪，爲什麽要過非人的生活？她這至上的淫威，何日才休止呢？我的囚犯命運，那天才出頭呢？······一，我也曾毫無，出息地希望着···「那個救苦救難的菩薩來拯救我這可憐的童養媳。」但我又曾壯烈地想用我的力去擊踣這萬惡的魔王，自私自利的東西，因爲我覺悟要拯救自己是需要自己的力的！然而當我幾乎要狂喊了出來的時候，我又意識到凶毒狂亂的耳光將會駕臨到我的臉上肉上，以至大腿上，于是我就把所計劃着的一切，都不聲響地呑在肚皮裏。</p>
<p>這些事，雖然已經成了童年時代沉痛的回憶，但那生活的滋味，每當我一玩味着的時候，我的心頭便感着極大的驚悸！但我有時也曾悔恨以至於咒詛自已那時爲什麽太懦弱了，不是我曾經也得着過「要救自己是需要自己的力」的啟示麽？爲什麽我自始至終像朱羊般的妥恊屈服呢？····</p>
<h3>殘酷的人類</h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>搖船的阿的林，剛從對江把船划過來。</p>
<p>這一棹船。已經不興了。是他底父親遺傳下來的。</p>
<p>他今年已五十八歲。整整的，計算起來，這一棹划船，無論如何總比阿林的年紀還大。</p>
<p>是半夜裏</p>
<p>不待到船兒停妥，他已跳到岸上。</p>
<p>「先生，我底小兒有急病。肚子痛得在發呌！有没有痧藥水？請給一些我。」</p>
<p>他對着輪渡局裏，在乘凉的一位不認識的先生説。</p>
<p>「有病？送醫院才興啊！」那位先生在揑着他自己的脚。</p>
<p>「是呀！先生，我也是這麽想着。可是，可是醫院裏要化錢的！</p>
<p>「唉。没有錢？那是根本没有辦法法</p>
<p>的。去吧，這兒也没有什麽痧藥也。·······」</p>
<p>「先生，如果送進醫院，要多少錢啊？」</p>
<p>「這，我也不知道。如果你有錢，那末你送ＸＸ醫院得了！那兒，那兒，我們這兒買辦先生的老婆，不多幾天也給看好的。晤，據説她也是發的急痧症。······」</p>
<p>「好，謝謝！先生。」</p>
<p>阿林皺了眉，説着，又跳上了那棹小船。</p>
<p>死命的搖着。搖到對江。跳上了岸，喘着氣，奔着。向茅屋那邊奔去。</p>
<p>「阿林，怎麽辦啊？林弟的臉色不好看了。」他底妻，泣着説。</p>
<p>「送···醫院！」</p>
<p>他一點都不計算的説着。</p>
<p>「錢呢」</p>
<p>「把棉衣···都搬出去當。」他憤恨着自己的命運。</p>
<p>接着。有五包衣服，都背着向東鎭走去。</p>
<p>五包大小的布棉衣。只得到三塊銀洋。</p>
<p>心急着。把兒子背上了船。</p>
<p>他，妻子，林弟。三個人。林弟一個子躺着。餘的，都盡力地在划船。</p>

<p>「先生，趕快請醫生來救救命吧！」</p>
<p>阿林對穿白衣服的護士説着。</p>
<p>「等一會！得了。」</p>
<p>毫不關心的走開了。</p>
<p>過了一會兒。醫生來啦！</p>
<p>頭髮和皮鞋都光亮的。打量了阿林一會，瞧了瞧睡在病榻上的林弟。搖着頭。説。</p>
<p>「喂！你預備住院嗎？三元半錢一天！這様做，或者有救！····」</p>
<p>「先生，可以遲一點兒付嗎。」</p>
<p>阿林想得到最後一綫的希望。</p>
<p>「不興！先付住院費！本來要付十天。看你窮。就先付五天好了。」</p>
<p>「先生有没有有再便宜一點的房間？　」</p>
<p>「誰不呌你早一點來？人都擠滿了！」</p>
<p>「先生，我們是想不到他會生病的！」</p>
<p>他們絕望了！</p>
<p>林弟的眼兒在發白。</p>
<p>「先生，救命藥給一點他吃好嗎？····」</p>
<p>阿林苦呌着。</p>
<p>「晤。除非打針！」</p>
<p>「打針不要錢吧？」阿林的妻子揑着眼睛，想得到最後的滿足。</p>
<p>「那裏？我們的藥水不是不化錢的！」</p>
<p>醫生扯着他底硬領。説。</p>
<p>「先生，二塊錢够嗎？·····」阿林苦求着。</p>
<p>「走吧！這兒不是買東西的地方！」</p>
<p>醫生踏進了醫士室。</p>
<p>林弟，氣息没有了。</p>

<p>他底妻子，哭着。</p>
<p>痛心的，把林弟背到那棹將破壞的船上。</p>

<h3>妻子不貞</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>敝友甲君，今年二十三歲。幼時喪母，其父只此一子，於九歲時，與鄰居乙女配親。女家方面。亦只生一女，又無姪子等人，因思女兒出嫁，家中寂寞。而且老來無人侍奉，故與甲父商量，將甲兒婿兩當，甲父一想此言有理，雙方均有益處。當卽允許。於是雙方同意，訂立合同。各取一張；並且雙方挽　人及證婚人三面言明，雙方永無異言，婚帖亦各取一張，到男長女大之時，再行擇日結婚。訂婚之時，在民國九年。甲年九歲，乙八歲，二人智識未開。不知婚姻之事，一切都由家長作主。</p>
<p>訂婚之後，雙方同居一家，甲乙兄妹稱呼，又在同校讀書。早出晚歸，甚爲親熱，雙方家長亦甚歡喜。後乙父在滬經商，因生意關係，不能回鄕，於民國十一年間，將妻女二人帶滬居住。乙父進益有限，一想女兒在申無事。不如呌他做工，還能貼補家用。故將女兒託友荐到烟廠爲女工。如是者五六年，甲已十六歲。讀過七八年書，乙父回鄕帶甲來申，甲就此輟學來申學業。甲滿師後半年餘，乙父在申去世，甲與親　一様料理喪事，奉靈位穿蔴衣，於十九年冬至。與乙及其母途靈柩回鄕安平進　。民國二十年甲乙到鄕間去結婚，婚後照舊來申居住。甲做店員，每月稍有進益。乙又有工資可貼補。加之乙父在世之時，稍有積　，故而三人尙能温　　日。至二十一年乙母在申患病逝世。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>葬依舊由甲乙二人回鄕料理。他們夫婦由鄕來申後。因原處房金太貴。乃遷移别處，租得亭子樓一間，每月房金六元。甲做商店職員月入五六元，乙做工每月二十餘元十餘元不等。然甲乙二人，尚能勉强度日。甲每月回家住宿五六天。不料此處後樓住的房客，全是男子，是三個同胞手足兄弟，並無妻室。他們前在外洋輪上做事，現在賦閑。他們當中的老二，時見甲妻一人進出，於是心起不良。時常引誘她。乙智識淺薄，受他迷惑，於是發生肉體關係，甲平日時聞鄰居言語諷刺，因此時常留意，日久就知悉，但無證據，經濟又拮据，難以發表。乙則行動與前迴異，甲到家時。視如眼中釘，時向他口角。甲鄕間父親尙在，時向中呌乙回鄕居住，但乙女怎願回鄕。現甲進退兩難，對於乙，棄之固不願。聽之亦不能。因循下去難不免反受乙及該男子之害。現在有幾個問題要問先生··第一，甲先到法院控乙不守婦道，提起離婚，甲要貼乙赡養費否？第二，控丙妨害家庭，誘惑有夫之婦，是否可能。第三，甲若暗殺乙丙有何等之罪？逃避别處，有害甲父否？以上三條。務請早日答覆。不勝感激之至。特此順頌敬請近安，高百歲上言。</p>
<p>答：令友某甲，其妻旣與他人通姦，他最好還是到法院裏提出刑訴，一方面與乙女離婚，一方面更控該男子以誘姦妨害家庭等罪。至於瞻養費令友是無須出的，因爲這種離婚，　在乙女，她那裏還能提出赡養金的要求，倒是令友反可因離婚之損害，向對方要求賠償相當金額呢，以上是對於你第一二條的回答，詳細情形應詢律師。至於第三條，令友却萬萬存不得這種念頭，假如眞的這様一來，不但使自乙有理變成無理，並且在法律上還要構成殺人罪。這是决計做不得的。</p>

<h3>乘凉（一）</h3>
<p>— 文里</p>
<p>大熱天，在晚上，乘凉的人們有錢的和没錢的完全不同啦。</p>
<p>有錢的人們，除了坐汽車向郊外如江灣吳淞如龍華道上以及坐游艇向黃浦江中兜風之外，花園跳舞塲那是一個乘凉大會集的所在。就比方靜安寺路中部那一家ＸＸＸ花園吧，昨天晚上Ｎ被一位朋友Ｃ拉進去，窮文人踏進紳士小姐太太老爺的人叢裏，眼界開展得多啦。這是因爲悶在家裏寫作正是熱得汗流頭痛的時候，Ｃ跑來看，Ｎ給他一把大葵扇還在熱着喊呌，他説引Ｎ到一塊乘凉的所在去，問他到那裏，他説明ＸＸＸ花園，Ｎ心裏暗想着，柄竪是你開口，就是要化錢，難道要我掏腰包不成？答應之後，穿了外衣就出門了。</p>
<p>坐在公共汽車裏頭，經過外白渡橋，汽車窗外看那東邊人行道上擠滿了人，他們大多數是虹口百老匯路一帶的店員與工人，有的穿着背心和短褲，手上拿着一把大葵扇，有的穿着短褂上衣打開着，有的靠在欄杆邊不動，有的來往的走着，—他們是在乘凉呵。遠望去，黃浦灘公園映着眼睛似地三三五五幾點燈光照着滿園的人躺在水邊樹陰裏。那公園裏頭，人影憧憧，隱約可見，有的坐滿了那一片草地，有的靠滿了水邊的欄杆，幾排坐椅更是塡塞滿了人。他們也是在乘凉呵。</p>
<p>車到了戈登路左近Ｎ跟着那位朋友Ｃ下車，走不了幾步對馬路現着一座霓虹光琳琅耀眼睛的跳舞塲的大門，在那裏黑牌汽車塞滿了旁邊的馬路，Ｎ心裏引起了一陣感想··這是有黑牌汽車代步的人們到來乘凉，消遣，娛樂，以及幹那不可告人的事的所在呵！Ｎ跟着Ｃ進了大門，進了園裏，音樂的施律的音響飛進了Ｎ的耳朶，這是跳舞塲，這是跳舞塲，Ｎ的心頭莫名其妙地跳動起來。抬頭見了坐在那裏乘凉的紳士小姐太太老爺們，窮文人就好像鄕下人似地自家不覺編促不安··他們穿的是那麽漂亮，自家穿的是這麽襤褸，身上雖然一様地穿着一套西裝，但那最街頭流浪的羅宋人的西裝！然而他腦裏立刻趕到了一個觀念··儘管他們穿得那麽漂亮，窮文人有自家的傲骨，我還瞧不起你們這些金錢寄生　的尸走肉的口自架子呢。這呌做意識的地克服了環境的誘惑吧？他心裏泰然地從紳士小姐太太老爺的跟前，，大搖大擺地走過去了。</p>

<h3>Chai Mountain's Visit to Peace Talks in Dalian Ends Successfully</h3>
<p>Concrete decisions were made on several selected issues, to be implemented shortly. The content is not convenient to disclose. He visited Yu Xuezhong in Tianjin for consultations and had a two-hour conversation with Meijin. (Beiping) Chai Mountain went from Ping to Dalian to attend a meeting. After the meeting, he arrived in Tianjin from Dalian last night and stayed at the Tokiwa Hotel. Meijin, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, visited him that evening and had a long conversation for two hours. This morning, Chai Mountain went to the provincial government to visit Yu Xuezhong for consultations. Meijin hosted a banquet for Chai Mountain at the Haiguang Temple military headquarters at noon. Chai Mountain left Tianjin in the afternoon and arrived in Ping that night. Chai Mountain told reporters at the station that the Dalian meeting ended on the 24th, and he and Yin Tong left Dalian separately by transport on the 25th. Regarding the content of the Dalian meeting, it is difficult to disclose as the time for announcement has not yet arrived. Chai Mountain's trip to Ping this time was extremely secret, and few people knew about it. (27th Special Telegram) (Tianjin) Chai Mountain left Tianjin for Ping at 9:00 this morning. (27th Special Telegram) (Beiping) Chai Mountain said that the meeting between Chinese and Japanese personnel in Dalian was in the nature of a conversation and did not take the form of a conference. The result was very satisfactory. Concrete decisions were made on several selected issues, and implementation will begin shortly. The content is not convenient to disclose. He plans to visit Yin Rugeng tomorrow to discuss matters related to the war zone briefly. Yin Tong will go south after the meeting to visit Huang to report everything. Someone asked Chai Mountain about the date of the Dongling takeover and the entry of the security team into the war zone. Chai Mountain replied that it would be soon. (27th Special Telegram) (Beiping) The Dalian meeting closed. Kanto Army representative Okamura and others returned to Changchun first. Yin Tong took the Dalian Maru to Shanghai on the 25th, then went to Mogan Mountain to visit Huang to report. Most of the issues discussed at the Dalian meeting focused on unresolved issues in the war zone. The content of the negotiations will only be released at a later appropriate time. Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Great Wall Line, the Japanese representative Okamura verbally agreed to gradually withdraw the Japanese troops within the Great Wall to outside the Great Wall Line and restore the pre-war state within the Great Wall Line. The administrative power of each pass of the Great Wall will be received separately by China. The number of members of the new security team in Hebei Province and the restrictions on weapons have been decided. Kanto representative Okamura plans to make a trip to Ping if necessary. (27th Special Telegram) (Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that although the results of the Dalian meeting are not fully known, the eastward movement of the special police team in the war zone is expected to be resolved. Before the opening, the Japanese side had already expressed that the number of newly编特警队 特警队 would be discussed. However, heavy firearms such as light machine guns are still not allowed to be carried in. Therefore, this meeting must have discussed a solution to this point. Our side's training of special police teams should be able to become useful police teams, not just in the number of people. If we send 7,000 or 8,000 people, and light machine guns are not allowed to be carried, what is the use of sending them? (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The British Side Quickly Seeks to Resolve the Military Movement Issue in the Zone</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters learned today that the negotiations between the British authorities in Tianjin and the Kwantung Army Headquarters regarding the movement of British troops in the Shanhaiguan area seem to be resolvable locally in a friendly manner. It is heard that the Foreign Office may make a decision on this case within the next two weeks, and then send instructions to the British Ambassador to China, Sir Meyrick. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Left Ping Yesterday to Return to Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan left Ping this morning to return to Chahar. According to reports, I came to Ping from Tianjin yesterday. My back pain has recovered. Because I have been away from Chahar Province for a long time, I am returning today to preside over military and political affairs. Chahar Province has suffered severe floods this year, especially in the Heihe area in eastern Chahar and Shangdu and Zhangbei in western Chahar. After returning to Chahar, I will investigate the actual situation and telegraph the central government for relief. A part of the 29th Army is currently being dispatched along the Ping-Sui Railway to protect the road. If the road is broken by mountain floods, they will cooperate with the road workers to repair the road. After the withdrawal of the Japanese and puppet troops in eastern Chahar to Doron, there is currently no action. However, Japanese people have recently been discovered in various Mongolian leagues in western Mongolia, and their actions are noteworthy. I plan to come to Ping again in mid-next month. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Funding for the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee Has Not Yet Been Received</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the central government determined that the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee would be allocated 30,000 yuan per month, the committee repeatedly urged for the funds to be released due to all committee affairs being conducted with the funds and due to insufficient allocation, and requested an increase. The central government has not yet allocated the funds. Committee member Wu Heling is waiting in Beijing to receive the funds and has temporarily postponed his trip north. The eight long-distance vehicles allocated by the central government were recently transferred to Suiyuan via Ping for standby use. However, the Ping-Sui Railway was cut off by floods, and the vehicles are currently blocked in Zhuozi Mountain. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Tempt Western Mongolia</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side has repeatedly conducted secret investigations into Mongolian local culture, land, minerals, and customs. Since the establishment of the Political Affairs Committee, local administration has been gradually promoted. The princes of various banners have thoroughly understood the Japanese tricks. However, recently, a large number of Chinese traitors led by Japanese people have secretly gone to various parts of western Mongolia to preach temptation. These Chinese traitors are all dressed in Mongolian clothes and use the Mongolian language to provoke and sow discord by various means. The authorities have paid close attention to prevention. Gelgelang, the representative of Prince Yun of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee, arrived in Ping yesterday and visited He Yingqin this morning to report on recent committee affairs. It is heard that Gelgelang will stay in Ping for a week before returning to Baiyun Temple to report back. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Chief of the Yutian Security Brigade is Replaced by Sun, Given to Zhou as Acting Chief</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that the chief of the Yutian Security Brigade has been replaced by Sun, Given to Zhou, the deputy chief of the brigade, as acting chief. Sun is a battalion commander of Dong Yingbin's division. He has been in the military for many years and has many connections with various parties, so it is more appropriate for him to act as the chief of the brigade. The former chief of the brigade, Han Zexin, was weak and incompetent and has been transferred to the province for other appointments. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Bandits Rampant in Yuguan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At about 3:00 a.m. on the 25th, the Dabeiyuan Village outside the west gate of Shanhaiguan was surrounded and attacked by a large group of bandits. Fifteen people were kidnapped, and various households were looted for an hour before they fled. Although there is a police station nearby, it is restricted by the Japanese side and does not carry firearms, so it can only watch the bandits rob. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese and Korean Vagrants in Qinhuangdao Collude with Bandits to Sell Drugs and Induce Gambling</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Hundreds of Japanese and Korean vagrants have gathered in Qinhuangdao, selling drugs, colluding with bandits, and setting up gambling stalls in the streets. The local area is in a state of disorder. The police dare not interfere with the bandits robbing one or two miles outside the city because they have no firearms. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Petition Storm of Discharged Staff of the Palace Museum Subsides</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The discharged staff of the Palace Museum staged a large-scale petition today. Ma Heng refused to meet them and only agreed to pay three months' salary. After several negotiations, it could not be increased, and they reluctantly accepted it. A storm subsided. (27th Special Telegram) (Beiping) Thirty discharged staff of the Palace Museum petitioned again on the morning of the 27th. Ma Heng sent his secretary Xu Hongbao to meet with them. As a result, in addition to paying for this month's living expenses, they will also be given two months' salary. All other requests were rejected. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Floods Everywhere Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from outside the Pass said that since the beginning of summer, there has been continuous rain in the Liao River basin. The tributaries of the Liao River, such as the Hun River, Zhi River, and Xinkai River, have risen sharply, causing houses to be washed away and collapse in Liaozhong, Tai'an, Panshan, Xinmin, Zhangwu, and other counties. Countless people have been killed. The autumn harvest is hopeless. Grain prices in Liaoyang, Shenyang, and other places have skyrocketed. White rice has risen to 1.2 yuan per dou. Merchants and civilians are complaining. The Yalu River in eastern Liaoning has also risen sharply. On the 20th of this month, the water level of the Yalu River was 25.8 feet higher than usual. The next day, the water overflowed the banks, and Andong was in danger of being submerged. Because most of the rice paddies on both sides of the Yalu River are operated by Koreans, it is slightly better. Regarding the flood situation in northern Manchuria, except for the great flood in Harbin, no county along the Middle East Railway was spared. Wuchang, Zhuhe, Yilan, and other three counties were all washed away due to the rise of the Songhua River. Tongjiang, Fujin, Hachuan, and other places were also flooded. In Wuchang County, the water of the Lalin River was 30 feet deep and flooded for more than 100 li. Countless residents died tragically. Because the Japanese people have hidden rebel forces in these areas from time to time, they sit idly by and do not help. Due to the flooding of the Lalin River between Caijiagou and Lalin on the southern line of the Middle East Railway, many small boats on the river drifted away without a trace, and food was cut off. Therefore, 70 or 80 Japanese male and female students who were sheltering from the water there all starved to death. Caijiagou Town has been completely submerged. Due to the flooding on the western line of the Middle East Railway, the international train that left on the 12th of this month was blocked between Genghis Khan and Nehe. The train on the railway between Qiqihar and Keshan was also completely impassable. The flood in northern Manchuria is the only one of its kind. The water level of the Nen River has increased to 23.8 feet, only 3 inches lower than the water level of the great flood in previous years. There are two or three inches between the Nen River Railway Bridge and the bridge. If it rains again, it may suffer another disaster similar to the great flood of previous years. The flow of the Nen River is about 800 meters per day. Once the flood suddenly arrives, Harbin will become a swamp within two days. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Anping Also Reports Floods</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Construction Department received a telegram from the Anping County Magistrate reporting that the northern tributary of the Hutuo River has risen, and ten villages including Gaozuo Village and Dagezhuang in the county are four feet above the top of the embankment. The rice crops that have been submerged are countless. Please provide relief quickly. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Yongding River Has Risen Sharply</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Yongding River has risen sharply. The highest water level yesterday was 14 feet. It fell twice by one foot this morning, and then returned to its original state in the afternoon. Dangerous projects are in urgent need. The torrents are surging. Men Zhenzhong, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, is inspecting the second and third sections of the south at any time and supervising the day and night protection. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Water Along the Ping-Sui Railway Line Has Receded</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the sunny weather, the water along the Ping-Sui Railway line has been discharged into the Sanggan River, Yundai River, and Yu River, etc. The water along the line has now receded. Jin Tao, the chief of the road works office of the railway, left Ping for Zhuozi Mountain this morning to supervise the road workers to rush to repair the roadbed. However, the extent of the damage this time is very serious, and the damaged area is also large. It is uncertain when the traffic on the entire line can be restored. The round-trip trains between Beiping and Zhuozi Mountain have returned to their original state today and have not been delayed. The roadbed in the Beibikezhai area of Suiyuan is in the shape of a levee and has not suffered major damage. The railway bureau is afraid that the roadbed is loose and takes precautions against danger. Traffic between Suiyuan and Baotou has been temporarily interrupted. After inspection and repair, traffic will be resumed. (27th Special Telegram) (Beiping) There is no more water accumulation at stations along the Ping-Sui Line, and the damaged rails are being rushed to repair. The upstream and downstream trains on the 27th have arrived on time, but because the projects at Fueshengzhuang and Sandaoying stations have not been repaired, the trains still only sell tickets to Zhuozi Mountain. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>The North Chaohe Bridge at Nantianmen Was Washed Away</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Chao River in Gubeikou City has risen sharply, and the water flow is turbulent. The original bridge is in danger. The North Chaohe Bridge at Nantianmen was washed away, and traffic was cut off. The Jizhou-Miyun District Office requested the provincial government to allocate funds to build two large and small wooden boats to temporarily maintain transportation. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Gu Mengyu Plans to Improve the Business of Various Roads in North China</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In order to improve the business of various roads in North China, Gu Mengyu specially summoned the responsible persons of the Beiping-Miyun, Ping-Han, Ping-Sui, Tianjin-Pukou, Jiaoji, Zhengtai, and Daqing roads to come to Ping to hold a meeting to discuss everything. It is heard that the directors of various roads have come to attend in person. Gu will return to the south after completing his official duties. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Organize a Great Wall Coal Mine Company</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Shimenzhai Coal Mine on the Great Wall Line is the largest mine in northern Hebei, with an area of 20 square miles. The Japanese side is planning to organize the Great Wall Coal Mine Company, invest 500,000 yuan, and jointly operate it with our side. A light branch line will be built from Qinhuangdao to the mine, which will be responsible for by the Beining Railway Bureau. Our side will use the land price and minefield to create a capital stock of 300,000 shares, and raise another 200,000 yuan, which is the same as the Japanese investment. The matter is currently being conducted by the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin. A meeting will be convened to discuss the contract. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Organization Promulgates a New Mining Law</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet organization nationalized all public and private minerals in the entire territory on August 1, prohibiting private individuals from obtaining licenses for mining, and promulgated a new mining law with strict restrictions. Various mines that have already been opened by private individuals will be taken over by the puppet government at a price. After the Jibei and Longjin gold mines, both large and small, are operated by the puppet state, the Chinese traitor Cui Xiangshan will be appointed as the general manager. On the 27th, dozens of remnant soldiers of Zhang Haipeng's troops suddenly surrounded the mine, kidnapped Cui, and demanded a huge ransom. The puppet army has been tracking and pursuing them, but has not yet found out where the bandits went. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>France Denies Investing in Manchuria</h3>
<p>Purely Japanese Propaganda</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the news reported by the Japanese electric communication that the French parliament approved the Economic Development Association's investment in Manchuria is purely a Japanese propaganda effort and has no basis in fact.

<h3>Chen Gongbo's Reply to Wu Zhihui's Letter on the Substantive Department's Reorganization Opinions of Shenxin Factory</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Yinfo, Director of the Industrial Department of the Substantive Department, said that according to the results of the investigation by the Ministry of Finance and Substantive Department of Shenxin and other factories, the debts and assets are insufficient by about 8 million yuan. The purpose of the government's intervention to maintain it is to maintain the entire industry and to prevent those who run the industry from being discouraged. The Ministry of Finance and Substantive Department are now planning to reorganize, hoping to find a capable person to reorganize and reform, and then return it to the Rong family. The goal is to be able to reorganize a method within six months. After six months, new shares will be recruited, or the company will be reorganized into a limited company, so as to maintain the existence of Rong's business and maintain the reputation and spirit of Rong personally, and not to discourage him. Liu also said that Shenxin and other companies have a lot of debts, some with mortgages and some without mortgages. The government will treat creditors fairly. Although everyone will inevitably be slightly affected in the future, the goal is to prevent creditors from losing everything. Therefore, the first step in the reorganization plan is to reorganize the internal affairs of the factories, and the second step is to repay the debts. Once it can reach the position of self-sustaining, it will be returned to the Rong family for operation. As for Rong's denial of the reorganization this time, it is actually a misunderstanding that it will be taken over by the state. Such speculation is not credible. The government's maintenance does not mean taking it over by the state at all. The current reorganization is purely for the sake of the business. If it can be maintained by itself, it is of course the best. Otherwise, the government cannot but maintain it. Therefore, the saying of ending the reorganization is inaccurate. Moreover, once a reorganization method is in place, the banking industry has indicated that it can borrow again. Now, after the Executive Yuan approves the reorganization plan, it will organize a reorganization committee to start work. (27th Special Telegram) (Nanjing) Chen Gongbo published two letters in reply to Wu Zhihui. One stated that the reorganization of Shenxin and other factories can only be done by the government organizing a reorganization committee, entrusting a specialized person, such as Li Shenbo, with full authority to fundamentally reorganize. Several things cannot be done at this time: (1) The Ministry of Finance will no longer collect and unify taxation; (2) The government will use its power to prevent creditors from suing; (3) Supervise various halls to implement layoffs; (4) Do not allow irregular transactions to be made again. At the same time, the fundamental issues of Shenxin can be discussed calmly, namely, A, after the debts are cleared, it will be returned to the Rong family, B, reorganize the limited company, so that the creditors are all ticket holders, and those who do not want to be shareholders will raise funds to repay the debts separately, and return some red shares to Rong. Which of the two is more appropriate will depend on the circumstances. My brother has no preconceived ideas and will have to wait and see how things turn out before he can judge. However, the general report of Shenxin has already been concluded, that is, to maintain both the Rong family and take into account the interests of the creditors. After this incident occurred, there are about two major opinions, namely (1) maintain the Rong family, (2) maintain the business. But from a personal point of view, the government should also find a way to maintain the Rong family. The Substantive Department submitted this to the Executive Yuan yesterday, but no decision has been made, because in order to help the Rong family, the Substantive Department only has this intention, and the Ministry of Finance has this ability. My brother has telegraphed Yongzhi today to ask for his consent. Since you are in Shanghai, please pay attention to this matter. If this matter can be accomplished, it can also prevent emerging entrepreneurs from being discouraged. (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>A Deep Look into the German-Austrian Entanglement</h3>
<p>Since the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, international tensions have reached a fever pitch. The world trembles, as if the calamity of a second World War is already upon us. Indeed, the puppeteer behind this event is Germany, and the balance of power in Central Europe is profoundly affected, making it incomparable to a simple internal conflict within a single nation. Thus, Italy is preparing for military action, and Britain and France are closely monitoring the situation. However, to say that a European war is about to break out seems premature. Although it is generally believed that this incident is related to Germany, the key to war or peace lies in Germany's attitude. If Germany wants war, it can take advantage of the chaos to interfere in Austrian politics, and war can start immediately. Conversely, if Germany still knows how to exercise restraint, it can ease the tense atmosphere. First, from the perspective of the international situation, we know that Germany is unlikely to launch a war quickly. It is well known that the current international situation is unfavorable to Germany. Before Germany and Poland signed the non-aggression treaty, the only countries wary of Germany were France and the Little Entente. After this treaty was signed, Russia also strengthened its anti-German sentiment. Recently, Britain and France have coordinated, and Italy has also shown obvious changes. The Polish fleet recently visited Russia and was warmly welcomed, indicating a tendency towards Russia and Poland as well. Germany is in an environment where it is surrounded by enemies. Even if it has reached the strength it had before the war, it can be certain that it will not dare to repeat its past mistakes and provoke a war rashly. Furthermore, observing Germany's domestic economic situation, it can also be concluded that it is not yet ready for war. Since Hitler came to power, Germany's domestic economic situation has not only made no progress but has also deteriorated. We can briefly list a few points to see how the people are impoverished. (1) The sharp decrease in cash reserves in the past two years. Germany's cash reserves amounted to more than 790 million marks in 1932, but by February of this year, they had decreased to more than 110 million marks. In less than two years, cash has decreased sevenfold, setting an unprecedented record since Germany's economic panic in 1931. (2) The contraction of national income. In the first half of 1933, the total income of the national people was 23.55 billion marks, but it decreased by 650 million marks in the second half of the year. Statistics for this year are expected to decrease further. (3) The drop in the consumption of general necessities. Last year's grain consumption decreased by 100 million marks compared to the previous year. The situation this year is even worse. In addition, postal revenue decreased by 100 million marks, railway revenue decreased by two-tenths, and transportation revenue decreased by one-third. All of these reflect the exhaustion of the national economy. If the German authorities were not mad, why would they disregard reality and pursue war? If Germany were to adopt this suicidal policy, it would give the Communist Party an opportunity at home before winning or losing on the battlefield. Hitler, who is familiar with the national situation, must be aware of this. Finally, judging from Germany's actions after the Austrian change, it can be seen that it intends to avoid conflict. For example, recalling the ambassador to Austria and appointing Papen, sending condolences to the Austrian president, dismissing the leader of the Austrian Social Democratic Party, and intercepting armed volunteers seeking to enter Austrian territory are all efforts to prevent the expansion of the situation. It is even more obvious that it has no courage to provoke war. Given that Germany cannot immediately wage war, why is it so eager to promote this incident, directly or indirectly? We believe that there are several reasons and meanings that should be explained. First, to demonstrate to Italy. Previously, Hitler paid a visit to Mussolini in Venice with great expectations, but as a result, Italy not only failed to cooperate effectively with Germany but instead gravitated towards Britain and France and advocated for the Eastern European Pact. The embarrassment it caused Hitler was extraordinary. Moreover, Dollfuss was able to maintain his position until his death largely due to Mussolini's assistance. If Italy's power is not eliminated, the Germans will not be able to achieve their goals in the Danube region. Therefore, it is only natural to harbor resentment towards Italy and demonstrate with the Austrian affair. Second, to divert the attention of the people. Since Hitler's large-scale massacre, the hearts of the German people have not been settled. Hitler was very worried that it would cause further trouble. This time, the Austrian change has led to a serious international situation, diverting the attention of the people outward, which is a fortunate event for Hitler personally. Therefore, in conclusion, the impact of the Austrian change on Germany's internal affairs is no less than its impact on its diplomacy. However, Hitler is constrained by his strength, and may not be determined to merge Austria immediately. Therefore, it is very unlikely to cause an immediate international war. However, since many people disapprove of the actions of the National Socialist Party, Germany will inevitably fall into an increasingly isolated predicament. This is something that can be foreseen.</p>

The former Envoy to Austria, Leisz, was recalled yesterday. The dispatch of Papen, a former German Premier, to Austria is seen as an attempt to ease the tensions arising from the recall of Leisz. It is said that Papen's posting to Austria is temporary, but the duration has not been announced. Papen has now resigned from his positions as Vice Premier and Commissioner of the Saar Region. The government also issued a communique last night, announcing that Habicht, the leader of the Austrian branch of the National Socialist Party, had been dismissed. However, the communique also stated that, according to detailed investigation, Germany had no direct or indirect involvement in the Austrian events. Habicht had repeatedly broadcast anti-Austrian propaganda, especially his "Appeal to the Austrians" on February 12 this year, which was widely known and drew considerable criticism from abroad. Habicht was expelled from Austria by Dollfuss last June. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Writes to Papen</h3>
<p>Expressing Unwillingness to be Drawn into the Austrian Turmoil</p>
<p>Hoping to Restore German-Austrian Relations to Normalcy</p>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler wrote to Vice Premier Papen, expressing his admiration and complete trust, and said that the European situation was already precarious, and now with the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dr. Dollfuss, he could not help but feel apprehensive about the future. He sincerely hoped to stabilize the situation and restore German-Austrian relations to their usual friendly state. After receiving Hitler's letter, Papen agreed to accept the post of Ambassador to Austria. (Reuters, 26th) (Berlin) German Premier Hitler appointed Vice Premier Papen as Special Envoy to Vienna, succeeding Dr. Leisz, the Envoy to Austria, and wrote a letter to Papen, which stated: "Since the events in Vienna, I have written to the President from Bayreuth, requesting the President to recall the current Envoy to Austria, Dr. Leisz, because Dr. Leisz, without consulting the national government, arbitrarily accepted the requests of Austrian cabinet members or traitors, concluded compromise conditions for the rebels, provided security guarantees to the traitors, and allowed them to retreat into German territory. Although Dr. Leisz's actions did not in the slightest intend to involve Germany in Austrian internal affairs, in fact, they led Germany into the vortex of Austrian internal events. It should be known that the German government deeply regrets and deplores the attempted coup and assassination of the Premier. This action is sufficient to exacerbate the already unstable European political situation, but this is not our fault. Therefore, I wish to contribute within the possible range to alleviate the overall situation, and especially wish to restore the long-standing disputes between Germany and Austria to a normal and friendly path. Based on this goal, I am now requesting you to accept this task willingly, because since we have worked together in the cabinet, you have always been relied upon by me, and I still rely completely and without reservation on you. Therefore, I suggest to President von Hindenburg that you be relieved of your duties as Vice Premier and Chairman of the Saar Question Committee, and that you be sent to Vienna as a Special Envoy to perform the duties of German Envoy to Austria for a limited period of time, and that you, in this capacity, be directly under my control. As for your previous efforts in the national reconstruction and the services you have rendered to the German nation since you worked with us, I now express my deepest gratitude again," etc. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Papen's Mission to Austria: Germany Plays a Role</h3>
<p>Distracting from Internal Problems and Preserving Political Prestige</p>
<p>And Using This to Show a Desire to Avoid Exacerbating the Austrian Crisis</p>
<p>Parisian circles Remain Skeptical</p>
<p>(Berlin) Premier Hitler's appointment of Vice Premier Papen as Special Envoy in place of Envoy to Austria Leisz is generally interpreted as serving two purposes: on the one hand, to remove Papen from the cabinet without completely damaging his political prestige; on the other hand, to clearly express Germany's position on the Vienna events. It is said that Papen and Propaganda Minister Goebbels often clashed in the cabinet. Before the events of June 30, Papen criticized German domestic politics in a speech at the University of Marburg, which further exacerbated the conflict between Papen and Goebbels. Papen's position in the cabinet was quite precarious. When Papen was arrested on July 1 and monitored by the Prussian Premier's special police force, Papen's position became even more precarious. However, Papen later delivered a speech at the funeral of Pospishil, a subordinate of Papen who was killed in the events of June 30, which showed that Papen's position in the country was not as strong as speculated. This time, Hitler took the opportunity to send Papen abroad, which may also be a strategy to lure the tiger away from the mountain. In addition, Papen is not a core member of the National Socialist Party, and his mission to Austria can be used to show a more moderate German attitude towards the Austrian events, which is generally seen as a good omen. (Havas, 26th) (Berlin) Since Vice Premier Papen was appointed as Special Envoy to succeed Envoy to Austria Leisz, people have been asking each other what Papen's mission is and why, according to precedent, envoys to foreign countries are under the command of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, why is Papen appointed solely by Premier Hitler? Some believe that the Berlin authorities are aware of their failure and have appointed Papen, who is known for his tact, as an envoy to ease people's hearts. It is still remembered that when the National Socialist Party in the Saar region caused trouble due to violence and was dissolved, Papen was ordered to go there and was finally able to create the German Front to replace it. Could it be that Papen's mission to Austria is similar in nature? It is not yet known. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>German Press Changes Its Tone</h3>
<p>Strenuously Denying Allegations of Aiding and Abetting the Austrian Crisis</p>
<p>The Envoy's Actions Should be Held Personally Responsible</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the Vienna coup, German newspapers have unanimously expressed sympathy for the Austrian people, who are plagued by internal unrest, but deny the allegations in foreign newspapers that Germany was largely involved. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung mentioned in its editorial today that the German Envoy to Austria's obvious support for Austrian rebels led foreign newspapers to believe that the German government should be held responsible for the Vienna events. However, the newspaper said that the Envoy has now been recalled, which proves that his actions were his own initiative and that he should be held personally responsible. Moreover, the Envoy's actions had a more humane purpose, namely to avoid greater bloodshed and facilitate the release of the detained cabinet members. If Austrian newspapers want to use this matter to call on other countries to unite against Germany, they should know that even Austrian cabinet members in the midst of the coup crisis had nowhere to hide but the German Embassy. The Berliner Tageblatt quoted the German government as saying that it immediately banned traffic between Germany and Austria after the Vienna events, while Austrian stormtroopers remained in Germany, more than a hundred miles from the border, which proves that Germany has made every effort to prevent the expansion of the events. The Lokal-Anzeiger said, "[The bloody events in Austria naturally aroused strong sympathy throughout Germany, and the tragic death of Premier Dollfuss is especially regrettable," etc., which is representative of the general opinion. (National Telegram, 26th)rv</p>
<h3>Austrian People Greatly Relieved</h3>
<p>Vienna - Germany's more moderate attitude towards Austria, the appointment of Papen as Ambassador to Austria, and the dismissal of Habicht, the German leader of the Austrian Social Democratic Party, have all had a reassuring effect in Austria and made it easier to decide on the appointment of a new Chancellor. Today, the Deutsche Zeitung published a so-called Hitler peace proposal, which has been distributed by plane to the rebels still in Styria and Carinthia. Habicht's dismissal is seen by many as evidence that the German Premier has appeased the Austrian Social Democratic Party. According to information from Munich, the German authorities there are now on high alert to prevent any unrest by the Bavarian branch of the Austrian Social Democratic Party. Five hundred members of the National Socialist Party's Black Shirts have been ordered to go to Freilassing, because the Austrian Social Democratic Party is stationed there. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Nazi Party Flees to Germany and is Expelled Back</h3>
<p>A Group Attempted to Flee and Was Disarmed Vienna, today, at Passo, on the Austrian-German border, some members of the Austrian Nazi Party attempted to flee into Germany, but were shot at and driven back by the internal security forces, wounding several. Several who had already entered Germany were detained by German police and handed over to the internal security forces (Reuters telegram, 27th). Another telegram: Today, eighty-five members of the Austrian Nazi Party crossed the border and fled into Yugoslavia, where they were all disarmed (Reuters telegram, 27th).</p>
<p>Germany Lifts Border Blockade Order</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the Vienna incident, the German government immediately issued an order at 4:00 PM on Sunday to block the German-Austrian border. Now that normalcy has been restored, the border blockade order was lifted today. Traffic between Germany and Austria will continue to be handled according to the regulations of May 29th of last year (People's Telegram, 26th).</p>
<h3>Italy Moves Troops to Austrian Border</h3>
<p>Recognizing the Seriousness of the Situation, Preparing for All Contingencies</p>
<p>Mussolini Convenes a Summit Meeting</p>
<p>Will Jointly Protest to Germany with Britain</p>
<p>Rome, today, official sources report that sufficient army and air force units to deal with any eventuality were deployed yesterday to the Brenner Pass and the Palinze border area on the Austrian-Italian border. However, as the situation is now gradually stabilizing, there is no need for any action other than these precautionary measures. The Italian government cannot but take a serious view of the Austrian situation. Premier Mussolini arrived at his office this morning and consulted with his advisors. Those consulted included the deputy ministers of the three departments of foreign affairs, army, and air force. It is widely believed that the Premier will first propose to Britain and France that they jointly protest to Germany, because Germany must bear some responsibility for the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss. Upon hearing the details of the Austrian Chancellor's assassination, Italians have become increasingly disgusted with the Nazi Party (Reuters telegram, 26th).</p>
<p>According to news from the Carinthian border of Austria, two Italian army battalions have advanced towards Leibach and Tarvisio, but no incidents have been reported at the border (Reuters telegram, 27th).</p>
<p>Mobilization of the Army in Rome Four army divisions, totaling at least 32,000 men, but perhaps not that many in reality, have been transferred to the Brenner Pass and Carinthia regions on the Italian-Austrian border. It is unknown how many air force personnel have been mobilized. The reason for the troop movements is generally interpreted as Italy's opposition to foreign interference in Austrian internal affairs, and thus the need to prepare for all eventualities. The gravity of the situation is not being concealed. The British and French ambassadors to Italy are in constant contact with the Foreign Ministry (Havas telegram, 26th).</p>
<p>French Reaction (Paris) Premier Mussolini's rapid dispatch of troops to the border upon hearing the alarm about the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss has attracted great attention from the French, who see it as a timely demonstration of Italy's commitment to justice. Although the German government has recalled its ambassador to Vienna, who was involved with the Austrian rebels, and has blocked the border to prevent Austrian political prisoners from entering, Parisian commentators generally believe that German Chancellor Hitler is behind the Austrian coup (Reuters telegram, 26th).</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Declares Policy Towards Austria Unchanged</h3>
<p>Rome, today, the Italian Foreign Minister issued a declaration stating that Italy's policy towards Austria will not change as a result of Wednesday's incident. He pointed out that Germany's swift suspension of border traffic after the incident proves that Germany has no intention of interfering in Austrian internal affairs, and therefore believes that Germany's policy does not create additional difficulties for the powers. The Foreign Minister strenuously denied reports in foreign newspapers that Italian troops were massing on the border. He stated that while Italy has deployed several army and air force battalions to the Brenner Pass and Carinthia in northern Italy to prevent any untoward incidents, these forces are sufficient to prevent any eventuality. However, as the domestic situation in Austria is gradually returning to normal, there is no need to take any further action. It is also reported that the commander of the Carinthian forces has issued a proclamation to reassure the people and prevent mutual suspicion (National Telegram, 26th).</p>
<h3>Britain Does Not Want to Interfere</h3>
<p>Observing the Evolution of the Situation (London) In a statement made by Foreign Secretary Simon in the House of Commons, he said that although the United Kingdom continues to support the independence and territorial integrity of Austria, Britain is not currently considering any action to interfere in the Austrian incident. Britain believes that the new Austrian government will be able to control the situation. Simon's speech shows that the British public unanimously opposes the assassination of Dollfuss. It is widely believed here that the German ambassador to Austria's mediation for the rebels was done on the orders of the Berlin government. Although the German government has repeatedly denied this, it is still being severely criticized here. In short, Britain is willing to trust the new Austrian government until it decides whether intervention is necessary, but the British government is paying close attention to the evolution of the situation. It is generally believed that Italy will not intervene militarily in the Austrian incident. Italy has always taken an ambiguous attitude towards the ambitions of the Nazi Party, and it is hoped here that this tragedy may eliminate this ambiguity (Havas telegram, 26th).</p>
<h3>France Temporarily Remains Silent</h3>
<p>Respecting Austrian Independence</p>
<p>Expressing Sympathy for Italy's Position</p>
<p>(Paris) Responsible officials have remained largely silent on the Austrian incident. It is widely believed that although Dollfuss is dead, his cause of maintaining Austrian independence will be continued by his successors. The British Foreign Secretary Simon's statement in the House of Commons (namely, that Britain's attitude towards Austrian independence will not change due to recent events) is viewed here with satisfaction, but not with surprise. Mussolini's position is very clear, and this is met with sympathy here, as France, like Italy, believes that respecting Austrian independence is an essential element in maintaining the balance of power in Europe (Havas telegram, 26th).</p>
<h3>The United States is Deeply Concerned</h3>
<p>Still Strictly Adhering to the Policy of Non-Intervention (Washington) The State Department believes that the situation in Austria is very serious. Although President Roosevelt is currently traveling, he is still being kept informed of developments in Vienna, and is paying particular attention to the reactions of Britain and France (Havas telegram, 26th).</p>
<h3>Convening of the League of Nations Meeting</h3>
<p>Britain and France Believe it is Not Yet Necessary</p>
<p>(London) London is not inclined to believe the report from Paris this afternoon that the League of Nations Administrative Council will convene a special meeting in Geneva next week to deal with the overall situation in Austria. The French Foreign Ministry also denies that France has made such a proposal, as it is widely believed that the Austrian incident is currently only a domestic matter and has not raised the issue of foreign intervention. Although Germany is suspected of inciting the Austrian unrest, it is now taking a legitimate stance of non-intervention in diplomacy and is generally refusing to accept Austrian rebels (Reuters telegram, 26th).</p>
<h3>Austrian Internal Security Forces Fully Suppress the Rebellion</h3>
<p>Hundreds Killed or Wounded in Two Days of Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>Rebel Leaders Surrender</p>
<p>Order Gradually Restored in Vienna The rebellions in all provinces of Austria have been suppressed. The leaders of the rebels in Styria, Carinthia, and Carinthia have been captured. Currently, the main problem is the encirclement and capture of the rebels, seeking to minimize loss of life and property damage. Vienna is rapidly returning to normal (Reuters telegram, 27th).</p>
<p>In Upper Styria and parts of Carinthia, Nazi rebels are still fighting fiercely with government troops and internal security forces. In Graz, the capital of Styria, rebels attempted to seize the prison near the provincial capital and release the prisoners, but were temporarily repelled by the internal security forces. Three rebels were killed and twenty-six captured. Order has now been fully restored in the province. Twenty members of the internal security forces were killed in the battle, but it is believed that the Nazi Party suffered heavier losses. Reinforcements from the standing army of Lower Austria have rushed to the troubled areas to assist the internal security forces in surrounding and capturing the rebels. According to official announcements, the Bering Pass, which connects Upper Austria and Styria, has been retaken by government forces. One major was killed and five soldiers were killed in the battle, and another colonel was seriously wounded. Annaberg Mountain in Carinthia has also been recaptured by government forces, killing nine Nazi Party members and seizing two machine guns and hundreds of rifles. It is reported that there has also been fighting in the central area of ​​Liao Steel. A total of twenty-six Nazi Party members and government troops were killed. Both sides have agreed to a truce until 6:00 AM tomorrow. The Nazi Party is still refusing to surrender its arms and is setting up defenses in the Schladming mountains. Although government artillery has shelled the area, it has had no effect. The Nazi Party is now controlling the railway trunk line between Vorau and Markt and Freiburg. The government artillery is currently bombarding it, and all traffic is blocked. Fighting has also broken out in eastern Styria, resulting in the disruption of the main railway line between Vienna and Italy. It is reported that government forces suffered heavy losses in the battle of Bering Pass. There have also been fierce battles in Salzburg, Germany. To date, a total of 900 Nazi Party members have been captured in Styria (Reuters News Agency, 26th).</p>
<p>Vienna According to public and private sources, it was learned tonight that 165 to 180 soldiers, police, and rebels were killed, and about 250 were injured. 1,200 members of the National Socialist Party and 600 members of the Socialist Party were arrested. According to rough estimates, there are about 2.5 million Nazi Party members and sympathizers in Austria, but only a few thousand are armed. About two to three thousand people participated in the incident, which affected forty towns (National Telegram, 27th).</p>
<h3>Prince Starhemberg Concentrates Power in His Own Hands</h3>
<p>Temporarily Acting as Chancellor</p>
<p>Vows to Continue the Unfinished Cause of His Predecessor</p>
<p>Vienna After the death of Dollfuss, power has now been concentrated in the hands of Prince Starhemberg. Starhemberg is only thirty-five years old and is the commander of the internal security forces. He was the Deputy Chancellor in the Dollfuss cabinet. Now, he is not only serving as Chancellor, but also succeeding Dollfuss as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defense, Public Security, and Agriculture (National Telegram, 27th).</p>
<p>Vienna The "Austrian Evening News" published a report stating that a State Council meeting was held this afternoon, lasting a considerable amount of time, and was chaired by Acting Chancellor Prince Starhemberg. During the meeting, Minister of Education Schuschnigg, who had been acting as Chancellor, handed over his authority to Starhemberg. Starhemberg then declared that the Austrian government pledged to work together with loyalty to accomplish the unfinished cause of Chancellor Dollfuss. The State Council then decided to establish a martial law court in accordance with the constitution to try those involved in the July 25th incident. The verdicts of the court will be executed immediately and no appeals will be allowed (Havas telegram, 26th).</p>
<p>(Paris) According to sources close to the Austrian Embassy, ​​the new Chancellor will not be officially appointed until after the funeral of Chancellor Dollfuss. Currently, only Deputy Chancellor Prince Starhemberg is acting as Chancellor until the new Chancellor is appointed (Havas telegram, 26th).</p>
<h3>Arrested Rebels Will Be Tried by Military Law</h3>
<p>The Mastermind Behind Dollfuss' Murder is Named Panneta</p>
<p>The Pistol Used Was Made in Germany</p>
<p>Vienna The mastermind behind the shooting of Dr. Dollfuss is said to be Mr. Panneta, a former soldier who was recently expelled for joining the Nazi Party (Reuters telegram, 27th). Vienna The government information office stated to the press that the pistol used by the murderer of Chancellor Dollfuss has now been proven to be a Walther, which was brought from Germany (Havas telegram, 26th).</p>
<p>Vienna Three rebels who shot and killed Chancellor Dollfuss are currently being detained in a local camp. The remaining 140 Nazi Party members captured in the Chancellery are still being held in the building, guarded by soldiers with machine guns (Reuters telegram, 26th). Vienna Thirty Nazi Party members who will be tried by a military tribunal for the murder of Dr. Dollfuss, and the remaining 114 criminals captured in the Chancellery, will be tried by a provisional court, which also has the power to impose the death penalty. Today, all government offices are still heavily guarded by troops and internal security forces that were called up two days ago (Reuters telegram, 27th).</p>

<h3>Dollfuss' Remains</h3>
<p>Funeral Held Today Remains Moved to City Hall for Public Viewing</p>
<p>Rumor That Italian Prime Minister Will Attend</p>
<p>Vienna The remains of Dr. Dollfuss will be publicly displayed in City Hall tomorrow, and the funeral will be held at 4:00 PM on Saturday. When his body was carried from the Chancellery to City Hall in a national hearse drawn by six black horses tonight, the streets were lined with huge crowds. The hearse was escorted by a squadron each of mounted patrols and infantry. President Miklas walked behind the hearse, followed by Deputy Prime Minister and Internal Security Forces Leader Prince Starhemberg, and then members of the cabinet. Both the President and Starhemberg carried pistols. The governors of all provinces announced to the public the achievements of Dollfuss and the tragic circumstances of his assassination. Telegrams from all over the world have praised Dollfuss without reservation (Reuters telegram, 26th). Vienna The remains of Chancellor Dollfuss were transported from the Chancellery to the City Hall yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, and were displayed in the City Hall. More than ten thousand people entered the City Hall in an orderly stream to view the Chancellor's face. Many officials personally attended the vigil, and a ceremony was held by priests. The coffin was placed on a platform to allow the public to pay their respects on Friday. The funeral is scheduled for Saturday, with a prayer service held by the Archbishop at St. Stephen's Cathedral before the burial. All churches will hold memorial services on the same day (Havas telegram, 26th). Vienna The remains of Dollfuss were moved into the church at 6:30 PM yesterday, and the casket will be sealed on Saturday afternoon for a state funeral. Hundreds of Austrians paid their last respects before the body last night. It is rumored here that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will fly from Rome to Vienna to attend Dollfuss' state funeral. If so, it will be very noteworthy, as Mussolini has not left Italy since the Locarno Conference in 1925 (National Telegram, 27th). It is rumored that Mussolini may personally travel to Vienna to be a pallbearer for Dollfuss. Today, a Foreign Ministry spokesman told the Associated Press that this rumor is completely unfounded (National Telegram, 26th). Vienna This morning at 10:00 AM, the line of people passing before the remains of Dr. Dollfuss was three-quarters of a mile long (Reuters telegram, 27th).</p>
<p>The Widow Kneels Before the Casket and Prays Silently</p>
<p>Mrs. Dollfuss arrived here by plane today from Rimini, Italy, and was received by President Miklas at the Chancellery. Miklas solemnly expressed his and the entire Austrian nation's condolences. Mrs. Dollfuss, her face pale and distraught, knelt beside her husband's body and prayed silently for a long time (Reuters telegram, 26th).</p>
<p>Telegrams of Condolence Pour in from Various Countries</p>
<p>Vienna Governments of various countries have sent telegrams to the Foreign Minister to express their condolences over the tragic death of former Chancellor Dollfuss. In addition, many dignitaries have also sent condolences in their private capacity. Dollfuss' remains were displayed in his office in the Chancellery before the sealing of the casket.

<h3>Spreading Rumors Shows Germany's Obvious Political Intentions</h3>
<p>Vienna - The head of the Patriotic Special Agents, Colonel Dang, broadcast to the Austrian people via wireless radio, stating that during yesterday's incident, the German government's intelligence bureau openly protected the terrorist actions of the Austrian National Socialist Party and spread completely fabricated rumors on its behalf. This action clearly has political implications, and its nature is extremely serious. The conclusion stated that because the German government's intelligence agencies participated in the Austrian rebellion, Austria cannot remain silent and acquiesce. (Havas Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>International Situation Is Urgent</p>
<h3>Defense of British and Dutch Territories in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>(Singapore Correspondence) - Foreign Reports Describe the Situation of Singapore's Naval, Land, and Air Defenses - Since Japan disregarded all world peace treaties and seized our Northeast Four Provinces by force, the inevitability of a second world war has been almost universally recognized. Therefore, countries are sparing no effort to strengthen their national defense and replenish their military equipment in preparation for any eventuality. Based on foreign reports regarding the defense arrangements of the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia, I will translate the essential points as follows: According to the Dutch semi-official news agency Aneta, General Snijders, who served as the commander-in-chief of the Dutch army during the European War, recently gave a speech at a mass meeting on the importance of national defense, saying that he believed a new global war was already brewing. He also stated that the current urgency of the war is more dangerous than the situation before the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. From this, one can see a glimpse of the urgency of the international situation. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Batavia, the *Bataviase Handelsblad* newspaper published a special dispatch from Malang discussing the defense of Singapore and the oil export port of Balikpapan in Dutch Borneo. From this article, we can glimpse how the British and Dutch governments are currently managing their national defenses so assiduously. The gist of this dispatch is as follows: Regarding the defense of Singapore, it stated that the largest caliber of the cannons used in the Singapore naval base is 45 centimeters, with a length of 18 meters and a weight of 150 tons. This was one of Britain's powerful weapons during the European War. In addition to this assistance, according to military experts, only a cannon with a caliber of 24 centimeters would be sufficient for the Balikpapan area. During the period of 1914 to 1919, the Netherlands had these cannons installed on warships patrolling the Indian territorial waters, and it stated that Singapore urgently needs powerful warships and cruisers for protection, while Balikpapan does not. This is not to say that this important oil port is not worth defending, but its terrain has the Strait of Makassar as its shield, which is better than Singapore's being completely exposed. Regarding air defense, Singapore and Balikpapan are currently not worried about air strikes, because if someone wants to carry out an air strike on these two places, they must use an aircraft carrier to carry many aircraft to go there to fight. However, in terms of the many nearby military bases in the two places mentioned above, any enemy warships must take many days to arrive, so we can be informed of the preparations being made here. Therefore, the enemy's aircraft carrier is easily attacked en route and difficult to reach its destination. It is said that Singapore, in order to strengthen air defense and coordinate with naval defense, will use 72 aircraft to meet the enemy once war breaks out, divided into four squadrons, three of which will be fighter and bomber aircraft. There are also 60 aircraft in Balikpapan, so a total of at least 130 aircraft can be dispatched. In addition, there are many anti-aircraft guns on land to prevent enemy aircraft from launching unannounced attacks. As for submarines, according to British news, the first line of defense in Hong Kong has stationed 11 submarines to prevent enemy troops from advancing towards Singapore. The forefront of Balikpapan's naval defense is in the Celebes Sea. Regarding the number of land troops, the British authorities previously declared that Singapore must have 70,000 troops stationed after the naval base is completed, so it can be seen that the British have already prepared. As for Balikpapan, including the artillery team, air force team, and all other necessary personnel in the army, there are already about 5,000 people, and there are the latest military weapons such as machine guns, so the defense can also be said to be solid. When we observe what is mentioned above, the Dutch are mentioning the defenses of Balikpapan and Singapore in the same breath, seemingly with a tendency to merge into one, so we can know what the relationship between Britain and the Netherlands is like. In the future world war, it will be very difficult for the Netherlands to remain neutral again. (July 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Tianjin Intensifies Construction of Airfield, Works Becoming Increasingly Active</h3>
<p>Adding Six or Seven Hundred Workers</p>
<p>The Municipal Government's Repeated Protests Are Ineffective</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence - In the case of the Japanese army's forceful occupation of land in Bali Terrace, Nankai, Tianjin, to build an airfield, after the Tianjin Municipal Government protested four or five times, the Japanese side has continued to proceed with the construction without stopping. They also insist that the land rented by the Okura Group has complete procedures, that the contract is valid, and that construction cannot be stopped midway. Previously, because negotiations were not progressing, the municipal government investigated the contract of the landlord, Guangrentang, and ordered Guangrentang to continue last year's court judgment and appeal again. Guangrentang filed a lawsuit with the Tianjin Local Court in early June, but because the defendant tenant, Zhang Shaoqing, was hiding in the Japanese concession and refused to appear, the case was suspended for a long time and not tried even once. Therefore, this matter had to be resolved through diplomatic channels again. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs paid special attention to this case because it concerns sovereignty and has telegraphed the Tianjin Municipal Government many times for inquiries. It originally intended to negotiate with the Japanese side after Huang Fu returned north. However, as the Japanese construction has become more active and there is no news of Huang's return to North China for the time being, fearing that any delay would make negotiations more difficult once the Japanese construction is completed, it telegraphed the Tianjin Municipal Government again a few days ago to continue protesting and to ensure that the Japanese side first stop the construction before any negotiations can take place. After receiving the order, the municipal government sent its foreign affairs advisor, Sun Runyu, to visit the Japanese Vice-Consul Tanaka on the 23rd, demanding that construction be stopped immediately, that compensation for losses be temporarily reserved, and that negotiations be held later. The Japanese Consul refused, saying that whether the construction is already underway or not, it is impossible to stop. Even if it is completely unfinished, it is difficult to terminate the lease and return the land due to excessive losses. However, what can be solemnly declared is that the Japanese side rented this piece of land not for vehicles. If an airfield were to be built, it would not be built before the occupation of Tianjin, and there are airfields along the Great Wall, such as Malan Pass and Shanhaiguan. If there is a military event, they can be gathered immediately, so why bother to open an airfield in Tianjin? In the future, this piece of land will be opened up for Japanese residents as a sports field because the Japanese residents lack a baseball, track and field, and soccer field, and there is no such land in the concession. According to Sun Runyu's report, the municipal government sent a written protest, still based on the points of the Okura Group's violation of the contract, demanding a halt to the construction. As of today, the Japanese side has not yet responded. Since the 23rd, about six or seven hundred bricklayers and carpenters have suddenly been added to the two fields, and dozens of large carts have been transporting wood from the Japanese concession to that area. The soil-filling work has already been completed. The fields are surrounded by wooden stakes nailed with wire mesh. Several Japanese police station patrols are inside supervising the workers, and judging from the wood being transported, there is a large construction plan. What is being built will only be discernable a month later, when the beams have been erected. The municipal government will report the details to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the same time, it will also send a letter to the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital, sending personnel to investigate and report daily to assist in negotiations. However, observing the current situation, it is feared that the municipal government's negotiations will not be able to stop the construction. (24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Actively Invading Western Mongolia</h3>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Bailingmiao to Incite Prince De</p>
<p>Western Mongolia Will Also Be Divided into Several Provinces in the Future</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence - After Japan annexed Eastern Mongolia, it had already divided Eastern Mongolia into three provinces. Now it is further invading Western Mongolia, also dividing it into several provinces, and dispatching personnel to incite Prince De. According to a person from Zhangjiakou, Japan's invasion of the leagues of Western Mongolia has recently intensified. The head of the Japanese special agency in Doron, along with seven Japanese people and five fake employees of the Ministry of Industry, went to the Xilingol League to investigate local mineral and commercial conditions. According to general expectations, Japan will have new actions in Western Mongolia in the shortest period of time. Furthermore, news from Western Mongolian youths reveals that Japan intends to use Buddhism to lure various princes in Western Mongolia under the guise of missionary work, and dispatch personnel to Bailingmiao to contact Prince De. The goal is to divide Western Mongolia into several provinces and manipulate the various princes under the guidance of the Japanese puppets. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have dispatched personnel to Eastern Mongolia to incite the Mongol people, dividing Eastern Mongolia into Eastern Province, Northern Province, and Southern Province. The central parts of Chahar, Hailar, and Jerim leagues have all been occupied by the Japanese army. Now the Japanese army is attempting to invade Western Mongolia again, also using the division into provinces as a political area. Western Mongolian youths are strongly opposed to this. News from Mongols residing in Beijing states that the position of Director-General of the Mongolian Autonomous Guidance Committee has been held by He Yingqin, Minister of Military Administration, and Zhao Daiwen, Central Committee member, since the Central Government announced their appointments. However, He has been modestly declining. However, in order to promote government affairs, the Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee has sent representatives to Beijing several times to discuss funding issues and has requested the Central Government to hope that He and Zhao will take office as soon as possible in order to guide and benefit administration. The result is still satisfactory. The Director-General's Office can be organized and ready in a short period of time. However, the location is still uncertain. The first director has already been appointed as Men Bingyue. The selection of the second director is still underway, but Lei Jishang seems to be promising. The Executive Yuan recently also appointed He Jingwu, member of the Military Affairs Commission, as a guiding committee member of the Director-General's Office to provide assistance. After receiving the order, He arrived in Beijing from Nanjing on the morning of the 25th. Around 1:00 PM, he went to Jurentang to meet He Yingqin and report on everything. The funding problem of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee has been set at 30,000 yuan. After repeated requests for an increase from the Mongolian representatives in Beijing, the Central Government finally did not approve it due to comparison with the governments of various provinces. However, the Ministry of Finance will pre-borrow a portion of the monthly expenses to the Mongolian side as compensation in response to the Mongolian request. News from Inner Mongolian youths residing in Beijing states that after the establishment of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee, there are no achievements to speak of in terms of guiding autonomy and various government affairs. The suffering of the Inner Mongolian people, such as rescuing pastures, establishing schools, developing industries, and rectifying transportation, has not been implemented. However, the committee's expenses amount to as much as 30,000 yuan, and it is not known where it is being used. It is hoped that the members of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee will not take this as a retirement agency and seek welfare for the future of the Mongolian people. (26th)</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Passes Through Qingdao from Dalian</h3>
<p>Yin Discusses the Satisfactory Results of the Dalian Meeting, Will Go to Moganshan After Arriving in Shanghai to Report to Huang</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence - Yin Tong, our representative to the Sino-Japanese meeting in Dalian, passed through Qingdao from Dalian on the *Dalian Maru* this morning (26th) after the meeting in Dalian ended, returning to Shanghai. The ship arrived in Qingdao at 7:00 AM this morning and docked at Pier No. 2 of the Grand Port. Yin was very secretive beforehand, so very few people knew about it. Only a few friends came to the pier to welcome him. After landing, he went straight to his relative's place at Jin Cheng Bank on Tianjin Road to rest. After receiving the news, the reporter went to Jin Cheng Bank to present a card and request an interview. According to a certain gentleman from the bank, he had not seen Yin. Later, it was heard that Wang Yangxian, president of the Bank of China, was hosting Yin at his private residence on Daxue Road. The reporter then went to Wang's residence on Daxue Road, but the doorman claimed that he had not seen Mr. Yin come. The reporter had no choice but to inquire with Yin's various friends about his whereabouts. According to Mr. Fang (Yin's friend) of the Lu Da Company, after separating from Mr. Yin at the pier at 7:00 AM this morning, Mr. Yin did indeed go to President Wang's residence, and his current whereabouts were unknown. The reporter was certain that Yin was at Wang's residence, but the doorman claimed to be unaware, or perhaps Yin had given prior instructions. Later, after inquiring in various ways, it was learned that Yin would be taking the original ship to Shanghai at 12:00 PM. It was already after 11:00 AM, so the reporter hurried to Pier No. 2, boarded the</p>
<p>*Dalian Maru* to wait in Yin's cabin. Yin was staying in first-class cabin A-1, with the name Yin Tongsheng on the door. At this time, Yin had not yet returned to the ship, only his attendant Mr. Liu was inside. According to Mr. Liu, Mr. Yin was in the city and would be back soon. At 11:50 AM, Yin was finally seen wearing a gray wool gauze robe (according to those who saw him, Yin was wearing a</p>
<p>uniform when he landed), holding a white cane and a small roll of newspaper, walking slowly. Wang Yangxian, president of the Bank of China, and several others came to see him off. The reporter saw Yin from afar, landed and greeted him, and then followed Yin onto the ship. According to Yin, he told the reporter, "I went to Dalian this time under the order of Chairman Huang to negotiate with the Japanese side on all outstanding matters in the North China war zone and the issue of abolishing the Tanggu Truce. The meeting place was in Xingegura, Dalian. The Japanese representatives were Kita, Okamura, and Shibayama. There was only one person on our side. We started discussing on the morning of the 24th. The first issue we raised was the abolition of the Tanggu Truce, followed by the security of the war zone. There are many detailed items, and we will still need to hold meetings from time to time to discuss them in the future. The opinions of both sides were consistent at this meeting, and the results were satisfactory. The Japanese side has agreed to abolish the Tanggu Truce, but the timing is not yet ripe. Regarding the issue of security in the war zone, our security forces have recently continued to</p>

<p>enter, and the Japanese side has agreed. We are currently working on establishing customs posts at various passes of the Great Wall. The issue of postal communications was not mentioned at this meeting. After arriving in Shanghai, I plan to go directly to Moganshan to meet with Chairman Huang to report on the progress of this meeting. Chairman Huang will be able to return to Beijing after meeting with me. It is undecided whether I will go to Beijing." As he was speaking, it was already 12:00 PM, and the ship rang its bell to cast off. The reporter hurriedly shook hands with Yin and said goodbye. (July 26th)</p>
<h3>Singapore Tea Merchants Restrict Peers to Sell Only Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>The Sales of Chinese Tea in Southeast Asia Have Declined</p>
<p>Tea Merchants Resolved Not to Sell Foreign Tea</p>
<p>Singapore Correspondence - Among our country's special products, besides porcelain, the top two are silk and tea. Recently, due to the dumping of Japanese silk, Chinese silk has almost no foothold in the world market. Our country's tea industry has also been in a slump in recent years. Taking the Southeast Asian islands as an example, there are a large number of overseas Chinese here, and most of them still like to use tea leaves as a daily drink. Therefore, the tea produced in southern Fujian, Wuyi, Anxi, and other places in our country has been imported to the South Sea islands in quite large quantities every year. However, in recent years, it has been greatly reduced, and the sales in the South Sea islands have plummeted. There are three reasons for this: (1) The dumping of Japanese tea; (2) The competition of foreign tea (i.e., Ceylon tea); (3) The increasing production of local tea. In addition, Chinese tea operators are mostly stuck in old ways and do not know how to improve, resulting in the gradual decline of the good South Sea market. The amount of Chinese tea imported into Singapore in recent years is less than two or three tenths of what it used to be. Recently, Singapore tea merchants, knowing that if this continues, Chinese tea will not be able to gain a foothold in Southeast Asia, convened a meeting of peers a few days ago and resolved several important issues on the spot. The most noteworthy is the restriction of peers to only sell Chinese tea from now on and not to sell foreign tea concurrently. They also plan to focus on publicity to awaken overseas Chinese and adopt Chinese tea. They also proposed to the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce to ask for its support in the publicity of Chinese tea. The large-scale national goods exhibition recently launched by the Chamber of Commerce will pay special attention to the promotion of national tea. (July 22nd)</p>
<h3>Military Training Corps at Lushan</h3>
<p>Chiang Personally Supervised Classes and Observed Drills</p>
<p>Focus on Academic Lectures</p>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence - Chairman Chiang established the Army Officer Training Corps in Lushan last year. Initially, the houses were mostly temporary bamboo sheds. Later, seeing the great gains from this short-term training, he expanded it and built barracks and opened training grounds near Haihui Temple, creating a large-scale military training center for the entire corps. Chairman Chiang took this as a way to train middle and lower-level officers to improve the national army, so he devoted all his efforts to the training work. After returning to Lushan from Nanjing a few days ago, he stayed at the headquarters of the officer training corps, personally supervising the classes and observing the drills, which was extremely serious. In addition to daily lessons such as combat, fortification, and field exercises, he also personally examined weapons and other items one by one. On the 23rd, technicians from the Italian Breda Arms Factory tested new types of guns and artillery. The corps commander and all the students attended to observe. On the 21st and 22nd, various mountain guns were tested, and all the students of the corps also participated in formation. As for academic lectures, famous party figures and academic experts were invited to take on the task. Each gave full play to their experience in their duties and research in their fields. For example, Chen Shaokuan lectured on the navy, Huang Zhenqiu lectured on the air force, Ma Yinchu lectured on economics, and Zhou Susheng lectured on international law, such as the handling of declarations of war, making peace, occupied territories, and prisoners of war. Cheng Tianfang lectured on the revitalization of the nation, and Zhou Fohai lectured on the Three Principles of the People, all focusing on spiritual speeches. During the flag-raising and flag-lowering ceremonies every day, there were two hours of lectures, mostly given by Chiang himself, from personal self-cultivation to governing troops and boosting morale, defending the country and protecting the people, and revitalizing the nation, all of which were earnest instructions. Chiang went to Guling for business and returned to the military training corps on the 22nd. Zhang Xueliang came along and was scheduled to give a speech to all the members of the corps within the day. Wang Zhaoming also accepted Chiang's invitation and was scheduled to come to Lushan at the end of the month or the beginning of next month to visit the military training corps, give a speech to the members, and discuss the recent domestic, foreign, and financial affairs, and all the important policies of the central government with Chiang.

<h3>Japanese Seize Mica Mines in Liaoning</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Resist Imports of Three Million Yuan from India, Can Solve the Needs for Electrical and Military Supplies</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence - The Taijiagou mica mining area in the fifth district of Liaoyang County has been surveyed by the Japanese and is considered the most promising. The Japanese discoverers, Okabe Shinichi, Hayano Mankichi, and Wu Yian, are starting to mine it. The quality of the mica is quite good. The Japanese have always imported three million yuan of mica from India every year. Once the northern mining area is discovered, it can not only resist the import of Indian mica but also export to other countries. In the future, the Japanese will be able to solve the military needs for military ships, aircraft, wireless communications, and electrical facilities themselves. Hayano Mankichi and others are currently operating privately. Last month, more than 30 workers were hired to enter the mountains. An average of one ton of mica can be mined every day. The method of mining is being actively expanded. The Japanese government plans to organize a large-scale mica mining industry company with national economic power in order to seize our treasures as much as possible. In addition, Shihozaki Kusujiro, manager of a store directly importing Indian mica in Tokyo, also came to the Northeast on the 24th of last month, visited the Liaoyang mica mining area in person, and signed a sales contract with Hayano Mankichi and others to guarantee the priority of future sales patents. As soon as the Indian mica is sold out, this mica can replace it. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Estimated Expenditures for Fujian Province</h3>
<p>For the 23rd Year</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The general estimates for local revenue and expenditures for the 23rd year of Fujian Province have been completed by the Department of Finance and submitted to the Provincial Government for review. The expenditure portion was announced yesterday.</p>
<p>(A) Regular Expenditures: 1. Party Affairs Expenses: $420,500; 2. Administrative Expenses: $1,579,598; 3. Judicial Expenses: $627,702; 4. Public Security Expenses: $4,834,956; 5. Financial Expenses: $1,558,493; 6. Education and Culture Expenses: $1,741,870; 7. Construction Expenses: $320,823; 8. Charitable Expenses: $146,061; 9. Assistance Expenses: $3,600,006; 10. Relief Expenses: $66,319; 11. Other Miscellaneous Expenses: $49,940; 12. Reserve Fund: $800,000. Total: $15,752,265. (B) Temporary Expenditures: 1. Party Affairs Expenses: $20,000; 2. Administrative Expenses: $148,095; 3. Public Expenses: $168,025; 4. Financial Expenses: $59,200; 5. Education and Culture Expenses: $15,000; 6. Charitable Expenses: $1,130. Total: $411,450. The total of both regular and temporary expenditures is $16,163,715. This is more than $1.1 million short of the revenue. How to reduce expenditures and find ways to make up the shortfall is still being planned by the provincial government. Furthermore, it is reported that the provincial government plans to reduce security fees by 12% and all other expenses by 10%, which would save more than $800,000 annually. The remaining more than $300,000 will be requested from the central government as an increased subsidy. Onerous taxes and miscellaneous levies will still be abolished as much as possible to align with the central government's concern for the people's livelihood. (July 16th)</p>
<h3>&lt;Anhui Province Dredging of Huayang River&gt;</h3>
<p>The Construction Department's Water Conservancy Engineering Office Drafts a Plan</p>
<p>The Entire Project Requires More Than $2 Million</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The Huayang River basin spans three provinces—Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi—covering approximately 8,000 square kilometers, with only over 4,700 square kilometers within Anhui. For more than a decade, local people have repeatedly requested dredging, but due to limited funds, it has not been initiated. In the winter of the 21st year of the Republic, the Anhui Construction Department decided to allocate $6,000 from the remaining funds for emergency relief in central and southern Anhui and instructed the Water Conservancy Engineering Office to draft a survey plan. A survey team was organized, and surveying began in June of the previous year, completed in August of that year. Recently, the office has conducted detailed research, determining that when the water level of Bai Lake is higher than the Yangtze River, it can discharge inland water to the lowest limit, similar to its original state. When the Yangtze River's water level is higher than the inland water, Bai Lake can accommodate an inflow of 600 cubic meters per second. Even if the situation were like last year, with the Yangtze River experiencing extreme flooding, the Bai Lake's capacity to accommodate the maximum inflow would only raise the downstream water level of the Yangtze River by three centimeters, and only temporarily, without causing any significant impact. Furthermore, the amount of water flowing into Bai Lake, combined with the total amount of rainwater collected in the area, would not submerge reclaimed land above the planned 26.5-meter level. To meet the above principles, separate drainage mechanisms and ship locks are established. The engineering design allows for a rapid increase in discharge at low water levels and a slower increase at high water levels. The selection of styles for structures such as barrages, dams, and sluice gates is based on what is most suitable and economical for the engineering situation. It is estimated that after the implementation of this project, 1.1 million mu of lake land can be drained, which, at an average price of $15 per mu, would yield a land value of $16.5 million. The value of the original farmland, which will increase in value after the project is completed, is estimated at about 298,000 mu, and at an increase of $5 per mu, would yield $1.49 million. The total cost of the project is estimated at $2,022,974.15. The first phase of the flood control project costs $689,000. After excluding the already repaired Mahua Dyke, a total of $534,127 is still required. Assuming this amount is split equally between the central and local governments, the central government's half will be requested from the National Economic Commission in accordance with the highway precedent. The local share will be proportionally shared by the benefiting provinces of Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi based on the number of benefited mu. It is proposed that Anhui contribute 60%, totaling over $160,000; Hubei contribute 38%, totaling over $100,000; and Jiangxi contribute 2%, totaling over $5,000. The outline of the Huayang River Water Conservancy District project plan and the method for raising funds for the first phase of the project have been drafted and submitted to the Construction Department for review and approval. The Construction Department is currently reviewing and organizing the above plan in detail. (24th)</p>
<h3>Hubei Province Relief Committee Seeks Aid</h3>
<p>Continued Reports of Disaster from Various Counties in the Da, Gui, and Xiaogan Areas</p>
<p>The Provincial Party Department Sends a Letter Requesting the Provincial Government to Quickly Stabilize Rice Prices</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: This year, Hubei Province has suffered from both drought and floods, and over ten million people are eagerly awaiting relief. The Provincial Relief Committee sent telegrams to various parties on the 26th to request aid. The texts are recorded below: (1) To the governments and relief committees of all provinces: Hubei has been struck by disasters repeatedly. Since the beginning of summer this year, rainfall has been scarce, and crops have withered. The autumn harvest is hopeless. Reports indicate that Guangji, Huang'an, Huangmei, Puqi, Xishui, Wuchang, Yangxin, Luotian, Gong'an, Yicheng, and other counties have been affected by drought, and famine is imminent. The suffering people are gathered, weeping in the fields. Seeing the devastation is truly heartbreaking. Furthermore, reports indicate that in Tianmen, Zhongxiang, Qianjiang, Jiangling, Hanchuan, Mianyang, Lishan, Tongcheng, Xiangyang, Yunmeng, Yunxian, and other counties, flash floods from upstream have caused rivers to rise sharply. Due to insufficient time to protect them, embankments have collapsed. Villages along the rivers have been turned into swamps, and homes and crops have been destroyed. Countless people and livestock have drowned. The disaster is extremely severe and unbearable to witness. If relief is not quickly arranged, the old and weak will perish in ditches, and the strong will be driven to desperation, becoming bandits. The future is worrying. We are willing to help widely, but our relief efforts are insufficient. Our hearts are burning with anxiety, and we do not know what to do. We believe that your governments and committees share our pain and have charitable hearts. We hope you will extend your compassion and the desire to alleviate the hunger and suffering of others, and fulfill your wish to save people and the world. We earnestly request that you show compassion, widely raise relief funds, generously donate grain, and provide humanitarian aid so that we can gather our strength to overcome the poverty, provide broad relief to the masses, and jointly avert the calamity. The telegram is urgent, and we await your kind response. Meng Guangpeng, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Relief Committee, bows. (2) To President Ju of the Nanjing High Court, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, Mayor Shi, and Vice Minister Xiong of the General Staff Department: The disaster situation in Hubei Province is extremely severe. This committee has telegraphed the Central Relief Committee and various provinces to request aid. We have read in the newspapers that the Ministry of Industry's proposed drought relief measures stipulate the purchase of 800,000 yuan worth of seeds to be distributed to the provinces most severely affected by drought, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. However, most counties in Hubei, except for a few in northern Hubei, have been affected by severe drought, causing crops to wither and the autumn harvest to be hopeless. Disaster relief requests are pouring in endlessly. Moreover, in areas along the rivers, homes and crops have been washed away by flash floods from upstream. Recently, strong northerly winds have been blowing with no signs of rain. The severity of the disaster far exceeds that of other provinces. Gentlemen, you care about your hometown and have charitable hearts. We earnestly request that you forward our request to the Ministry of Industry to include Hubei Province in the relief effort when distributing seeds to provide assistance and relief. We are extremely grateful. Meng Guangpeng, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Relief Committee, bows. (3) The telegrams sent to prominent Hubei natives in Jiangxi, Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Jin, and other places are similar to those sent to the provinces and are therefore omitted. Currently, the counties have still not received rain, and the disaster situation is extremely severe. Huanggang, Huangmei, Guangji, and other counties have become barren lands. Even if there were rain, it would be difficult to revive the withered crops. The Dabie Special District, Xiaogan County, and Qianjiang County, which has been most severely affected by the floods, have been sending telegrams daily reporting the drought. The dire situation is impossible to fully describe in government documents. At this time of severe disaster, the counties are all experiencing rice shortages. Unscrupulous merchants in Wuhan are taking advantage of the situation to hoard and manipulate prices, causing rice prices to skyrocket. The Provincial Party Department held a meeting on the 26th and decided to send a letter to the provincial government requesting strict measures to protect the people's food supply. Furthermore, the department received a telegram from the Central Government, stating that Hubei Province is experiencing simultaneous floods and droughts, and disaster has struck. Appropriate relief measures should be devised to alleviate the people's suffering. Special care must be taken to prevent the Red bandits from taking advantage of the situation to cause trouble. To prevent this from happening, the department should consult with the local provincial government to formulate effective measures to reassure the people and stabilize society. The department has also sent a letter to the provincial government for investigation and handling. (26th)</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Tax Collection Officer Detained for Over-Collecting Taxes</p>
<p>The county collects national taxes according to the old administrations of Hua'an and Jiangyin counties, collecting them separately. Ye Zongcheng, the director of the first national tax collection office, is in charge of collecting national taxes from the old Hua'an county. He has been in office for six or seven years. Recently, he was reported for raising the tax on land converted for salt production in the Punan coastal area. Since the 18th year, local businesses have requested an exemption from this tax. Official documents have been exchanged for several years, but approval has never been granted. Many have complied and paid the taxes over the years, but many have also defaulted. The salt tax dispute was later approved by the Department of Finance, and since the 18th year, a 40% reduction has been implemented. However, the director did not follow the department's order and generally collected the full amount. The tax on land converted for salt production totaled 10,300 shi. Besides the 3,000 shi in Pubei, Punan accounted for more than 7,000 shi. Although some businesses and local police had defaulted, the director had not listed and reported the collected salt tax. Therefore, Lu Boxin reported him for over-collecting national taxes and embezzling public funds. The county party department also filed a complaint. County Magistrate Jin considered the matter serious and potentially scandalous if true. He ordered the director, Ye Zongcheng, to be detained on the 22nd and appointed Yang Yunwen as his successor. It is reported that the county government has ordered the tax collection office to thoroughly investigate whether the director has indeed over-collected taxes, but it will not be easy to conduct a thorough investigation. After taking office, the new director, Yang, first submitted a list of all households that had paid the salt tax. County Magistrate Jin has telegraphed the Department of Finance to request instructions on how to handle the matter. Meanwhile, he will periodically convene editors to give instructions to compile a list of households that have paid the salt tax from the 18th year to the present for review as a basis for the investigation. Wuxi</p>
<p>Privately Settling a "Red Pill" Case Leads to Arrest</p>
<p>Zhou Rongquan, a resident of the Nantou area near the Tangtou (former Sixth District) in the Fifth District, had a facility for manufacturing "red pills" in the Dunshang area. Due to strict government crackdowns recently, he moved the facility onto a houseboat to avoid attention. On the 20th of this month, Yu, a former patrol officer who had been dismissed from the No. 9 branch of the Qianqiao Public Security Bureau in the Fourth District, and Wang were in the Nantou area on business. According to reports from acquaintances, Zhou Rongquan's family had two wooden molds for manufacturing "red pills." Yu and Wang, posing as inspectors from the County Public Security Bureau, searched Zhou's home and found the wooden molds. Zhou then paid $300 to settle the matter. Unexpectedly, on the 25th, Jiao Rongquan, the head of the village, reported Zhou Rongquan's secret of manufacturing "red pills" to Zhu Panquan, an investigator from the County Public Security Bureau. Zhu, along with Zheng Chao, a former captain of the Second Squad of the Inspector Brigade, Yang Rengen, Wang, and others, went to the village with the informant and discovered two batches of raw medicinal powders worth $1,000. Zhou then asked Jiang Xuchang, the head of the village, to mediate, offering $1,000 to settle the matter privately. Zhou paid $600, and Jiang was responsible for paying the remaining $400 within two days. However, after Zheng and the others received the money and returned to the city, they argued over the division of the money, and the matter became public. Chen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, learned of this and ordered the Inspectorate to detain Zhu Panquan. He also dispatched police officers to arrest Zheng Chao at the Dongxin Road intersection and imprison him for further investigation and handling of his accomplices.</p>
<p>Repercussions of Raiding Pharmacies</p>
<p>Li Wansheng's Candle Shop, located in Tantou Alley outside the North Gate, was raided by police officers from the County Public Security Bureau on the morning of June 22nd on suspicion of manufacturing "red pills." However, the search yielded nothing. Afterward, the shop reported the incident to the trade association, which in turn reported it to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the safety of businesses be protected. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to County Magistrate Yan, requesting that he instruct his subordinates to handle such matters with caution in the future and to investigate the person who made the report. However, the previous case has not yet been resolved, and a similar case occurred again the previous evening. The Zhongwai Pharmacy, located at the entrance of Xiaosifang Alley outside the North Gate, has always sold both Chinese and foreign goods and has a thriving business. As a result, it has a large number of outstanding accounts. Recently, Chen Yuanyuan of Henglin was involved in a case of prohibited goods. The police found a page from the Zhongwai Pharmacy's ledger. As a result, the county sent officials to Wuxi to cooperate with the Public Security Bureau. The previous evening, they dispatched a team to search the Zhongwai Pharmacy without explaining the reason for the search. At the same time, they dispatched a team to Zhou Shi Alley to keep watch over the home of the shop owner, Hu Shutang. The search of the shop yielded no illegal items, and the examination of the accounts of Chen Yuanxing showed that they matched and involved foreign goods. The officials took three volumes of ledgers to the bureau for inspection. However, the shop had already suffered a scare. Yesterday, the shop reported to the Foreign Goods Trade Association, requesting that it send a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, which in turn would send a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that the ledgers be returned after inspection and that the safety of businesses be protected in the future, so that teams would not be dispatched to guard and search at every turn, causing fear.</p>
<p>Suchuan</p>
<p>Tax Collection Director Accused of Malpractice</p>
<p>Zhu Xiquan (Mirror Wave), the director of the County's Farmland Tax Collection Office, has served for more than ten years. Recently, he dismissed a large number of employees, inevitably creating enemies. As a result, citizens Gu Zhixin and Zhang Shiyi jointly filed a petition with the Jiangsu Provincial Government accusing Zhu of: (1) manipulating the clearing of wasteland; (2) privately collecting taxes; (3) re-creating tax arrears; (4) re-collecting land price tax receipts and paper fees; (5) falsely reporting expenses for tax collection; (6) improperly borrowing "busy season" grain; (7) embezzling late payment penalties. They requested that the government quickly appoint impartial officials to supervise the local party and government agencies to thoroughly investigate Zhu and severely punish him to uphold national taxation and deter greed. The original petition stated that Zhu had embezzled over 100,000 yuan in national taxes over the years. Wujiang</p>
<p>Village Women Band Together to Loot Rice</p>
<p>Village women from Huamu and other places in the Zhenze District of the county gathered in teams on the 19th and 20th to loot food and pastries in Zhenze, causing disturbances. The local public security bureau dispatched police to suppress them and drive them out of the area. It also requested the county government to send reinforcements from the First Squad of the Fourth Security Brigade, led by Jiang Songkun, to oversee four patrol boats to assist in Zhenze. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 26th, over a hundred village women from Huamu Bridge, Angong Fan, and other places, most of them elderly with bound feet, rushed to the vicinity of the Hengtai Rice Shop in Xiatang, intending to loot rice. The Xufraction Bureau Chief led all the police officers to block them and, together with the local community police, ordered the village women to go to the City God Temple Square, where they were lectured on their obligations. Later, the village heads arrived to guarantee their conduct, and they were escorted back to their villages separately. Changshu</p>
<p>Road Workers Fight with Villagers</p>
<p>The construction of the Su-Chang Highway is scheduled to be completed by a deadline. The construction is contracted by Tai Kang Company and is currently underway. However, the road workers have been acting arrogantly, forcibly occupying civilian houses and privately cutting crops, which has become commonplace. As there are many workers, and they are from other provinces such as Shandong and Sichuan, they are not easy to reason with. Unexpectedly, on the 26th, a road worker from the Mocheng section had a minor argument with an employee of a pharmacy, which resulted in a fight with the entire village. They first kidnapped Chen Junming, the owner of the pharmacy, and paraded him with hundreds of people. As a result, the villagers came out to stop them, but to no avail, and they resorted to violence. Since there were many road workers and they had weapons, a woman named Yuan Shi was killed and six people were seriously injured, and more than ten people were slightly injured on the villagers' side. Two road workers were injured. After receiving the news, the county government immediately sent officials to the village for investigation. The Huang Cheng investigator immediately ordered Ding Dahua, the foreman of Tai Kang Company, to hand over the murderers for investigation.</p>

<p>Nengfang, the second daughter of farmer Wang Dexiu, who lives about three li southeast of Yixing Town in the Fourth District, is 22 years old and graduated from Qilin Girls' School with excellent academic standing. Due to her family's poverty, she dropped out of school. Her older sister, Nengxian, married Zheng Xiaoxian from the town. Unfortunately, she died of illness last year. Dexiu admired his son-in-law's wealth and asked someone to arrange for Nengfang to marry him to continue the family line. The wedding was scheduled for the autumn. The daughter opposed it in vain. She then committed suicide by consuming opium the morning before last. Her family discovered her and tried to save her, but she was already severely poisoned and could not be saved. She died shortly after.</p>
<p>Tragic Collapse Kills Villager</p>
<p>The front building of Chen Shanchi's teahouse in Sanxing Town, Third District, collapsed suddenly on the morning before last due to years of disrepair. At the time, over a dozen villagers were drinking tea downstairs and were injured by the falling beams, wood, bricks and tiles. Yuan Changxian, Tang Kaizhong, Huang Shaofu, and Xi Xiangshan were among the most seriously injured. Xi died the next day due to his injuries.</p>
<p>Tongnan</p>
<p>Dial-Up Throughout Jiangbei</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction has installed long-distance telephones in the counties north of the Yangtze River, with a total cost of over 200,000 yuan. The lines have been completed, and dial-up is now available throughout the area from the 26th. Once the Nantong-Wuxi line is completed in August, it will be possible to call south of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Bloodshed at the Fair</p>
<p>Fan Er of Fair Town married a woman named Xing. Xing had been engaged to Lu Shicai. Lu was angry that Fan had taken his lover and attacked Fan Er and Fan's nephew, Hua Quan, with a knife at night, seriously wounding them and endangering their lives. Lu Shicai was arrested by the security team and sent to the court.</p>
<p>Villagers' Dispute Leads to Death</p>
<p>Zhang Xiangeng's nine-year-old boy from Jinsha Village was playing by the river and untied Zhang Lian's goat from the poplar tree, causing a conflict between the families. Geng, Zhang Lianqing's wife, died at the scene. The court was notified on the 24th, and Prosecutor Wang went to investigate and arrest the murderer.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Large Drought Relief Water Pumps Arrive in Hangzhou</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Drought Relief Office previously purchased 28 water pumps from Shanghai, but the largest was only 20 horsepower. Recently, Zhou Zhenlun, the deputy chief engineer of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, went to Shanghai and purchased one 300-horsepower and one 85-horsepower water pump from a British water company for 18,000 yuan. The machine weighed 10 tons. After negotiating with the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau, a train was prepared to transport it and arrived in Hangzhou today. It is being installed at Datong Bridge in Zhakou. Zhou Zhenlun and others are currently supervising workers to speed up the construction of the pump foundations at night and aim to complete the installation and start pumping water within five days. It is understood that the 300-horsepower water pump can pump 1.5 million gallons per hour, which will be used to pump water from the Qiantang River into the inland rivers to irrigate farmland in the counties of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou to relieve the drought. Chief Engineer Zhou also went to Shanghai by the night train to purchase more water pipe materials and other supplies as they were insufficient.</p>
<p>Two Cars Collide in Xinshi Market</p>
<p>At 5:15 PM yesterday (the 26th) at the intersection of Wushan Road and Renhe Road in Xinshi Market, a private car with license plate number 131 was driving on Renhe Road. A car from the Huizhou Automobile Company with license plate number 1156 was coming from the Lakeside area. To avoid car 131, it struck a rickshaw puller, Xu Wenbiao, and a pedestrian, Wu Dahai, and a rickshaw. The car then collided with car 131 in reverse, causing damage to both cars. The police officers on duty detained both drivers at the Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Yangshuo</h3>
<p>A Puyi Bus Hijacked En Route</p>
<p>The Xinpu Puyi Automobile Company has scheduled buses running daily to Qingjiang, while the Qingjiang Sanyi Automobile Company also sends buses to Xinpu daily. Both lines pass through Shuyang before reaching their destinations. Recently, a Xinpu passenger bus traveling to Qingjiangpu was ambushed by bandits hidden in the sorghum fields about 20 li east of Shuyang. In addition to looting all the passengers' goods, they kidnapped seven passengers. One passenger refused to go with the bandits and was shot dead. As a result, six passengers were taken away by the bandits and are still missing.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Locusts Found in the Ninetieth and Tenth Districts</p>
<p>After a long drought, Shaoxing received timely rainfall, and the climate has cooled down. However, the amount of rainfall in each village is still insufficient, and the long-cracked farmland has caused the emergence of moths and locusts from this little bit of rain. In recent days, large numbers of locusts have been flying throughout the Ninth District of Ganfeng Township and the Tenth District of Nanhui Township, devouring the dying rice roots and greatly hindering agricultural production. The villagers are disappointed in the autumn harvest and are wailing.</p>
<h3>Funing</h3>
<p>Bandits Loot Qinqiao Muzhuang</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 10:00 AM in Qinqiao, Nanmi, Muzhuang and other places in the northern part of the county, about fifty or sixty bandits suddenly appeared, posing as officers and soldiers inspecting guns. Local enemies, Dao Sheng, went to Tianci Township to report and request assistance. Eventually, they were outnumbered and defeated. The bandits looted house by house and set fires, burning more than twenty houses belonging to Guo Benchong, Guo Weitai, Guo Bengui, etc. The cries and wails shook the ground. Guo Erzi, Ji Mingren, and four others were shot and injured. All the clothes, ornaments, silver dollars of each household were looted. At 9:00 PM, the Second District of Dongkan heard the news and sent forty soldiers to fight the bandits for a while. The bandits were unable to resist and fled to the northwest.</p>

<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>Yin Tong Returns to Shanghai from Dalian Yesterday</p>
<p>Says the Talks Made Definite Progress</p>
<p>Whether to Remain in Office Will Be Decided Together With Huang Fu</p>
<p>Will Meet Tang Yuren in Shanghai Before Going to Moganshan</p>
<p>Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, was previously ordered to go to Dalian to negotiate with the Japanese Kwantung Army authorities on the unfinished issues in the North China war zone. He has now completed his mission. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, he returned to Shanghai on the Dalian Maru. He will go to Moganshan within a few days to meet with Huang Fu and report on the situation. Yin released a written statement on the ship yesterday, saying that the results of this trip have made significant progress. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>After Yin Tong arrived in Dalian on the 23rd from Shanghai, he repeatedly met with the Japanese Kwantung Army authorities to discuss the unfinished issues in the war zone. On the 25th, Yin Tong returned to Shanghai on the Japanese ship Dalian Maru. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, it docked at the Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu. Yin Tong met with reporters from various newspapers on the ship and released a written statement that he had prepared. After disembarking, he went straight back to his residence to rest. Yin Tong said that after meeting with Foreign Affairs Vice-Minister Tang Yuren in Shanghai, he would go to Moganshan within a few days to meet with Huang Fu and report on the progress of the Dalian negotiations. Rumors that Japan demanded recognition of the puppet state as a condition for canceling the Tanggu Accord are absolutely untrue.</p>
<h3>Dalian Talks</h3>
<p>Yin Tong released a written statement on the ship yesterday. The original text is as follows: I boarded the Dalian Maru to Dalian on the 21st and returned to Shanghai on the same ship today. On the 23rd and 24th, I held two talks with Lieutenant General Okamura, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Colonel Kita, Chief of the Second Section of the Kwantung Army, and Lieutenant Colonel Shibayama, Military Attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Ping. (Each time, including the time spent eating together, was about five or six hours). All the newspapers have reported on the Dalian meeting, but in reality, it was just a casual conversation and not a formal meeting. There was no agenda and no minutes.</p>
<h3>Our Proposal</h3>
<p>Regarding the proposals for this meeting, they certainly originated from our side. Because during the previous discussions with Chairman Huang and related individuals at Mogan Mountain regarding North China's political situation, we deeply felt the necessity to eliminate all sorts of troublesome issues within the war zone. Therefore, Chairman Huang instructed me and my party to [P Meeting Content&gt;</p>
<p>As for the content of the talks, it is still not convenient to express it before reporting to the authorities. However, since this meeting was invited by our side, the matters discussed were, of course, proposed by our side.</p>
<p>It can be known that, in short, it is to clean up all kinds of troublesome problems in the war zone. The items are generally listed as follows: (1) Elimination of unscrupulous Japanese and Korean vagrants, (2) Reorganization of the security forces of Li Shi's department, (3) Entry of newly compiled security forces, (4) Taking over the Eastern Mausoleum of Malanyu, (5) Withdrawal of Japanese and puppet troops, (6) Reorganization of the Chahar East area, (7) Elimination of the Great Eastern Company, etc. All have thorough solutions. Although it may not be entirely as we expected, there is indeed progress, which is beyond doubt. Once Chairman Huang returns to the north and supervises the local authorities to establish a plan and implement it step by step, the disputes in the war zone can be swept away, and the situation in North China may be slightly better.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of Agreement</h3>
<p>The issue of canceling the truce agreement was not formally discussed. If China formally proposes it, the other party should have no reason to object. However, this matter should be thoroughly considered by the central government and should not be advocated rashly. The other party proposed the issue of postal communication. Since I am not in charge and have not been instructed, I did not respond. I still need to go to Mogan Mountain within days to report the details of this trip.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yin's Reinstatement</h3>
<p>My reinstatement depends on the actions of Mr. Zhe She. My entry into the bureau is of a guest nature, entirely to help a friend. If Mr. Huang leaves, then my help will certainly be complete. If Mr. Huang does not leave, then there is fundamentally no need for help, and naturally, there is no use for my help. That is the time for me to loudly sing "Returning Home!" I have not heard any clues about the Chadian bombing case. I believe it was done by patriotic youths with a chivalrous heart, but it is a pity that they did not clearly understand the topic or choose the means. As for preventing and arresting criminals, it is the responsibility of the military and police authorities, and I will not interfere, etc.</p>
<h3>Mr. Tang's Remarks</h3>
<p>Tang Youren came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to celebrate his mother's birthday. According to Mr. Tang, who spoke to reporters yesterday, Director Yin's trip to Dalian to meet with Japanese representatives was a casual discussion on all issues in the war zone and did not have any important nature. Regarding the issue of abolishing the Tanggu Agreement, foreign telegrams reported that the Japanese side stated that recognition of the puppet state was a condition for cancellation. This statement is somewhat exaggerated. As for the return to the north of Chairman Huang of the Peiping Political Affairs Readjustment Committee, it will probably depend on the results after Mr. Yin returns to Shanghai and reports to Mogan Mountain. Whether I will accompany Mr. Yin to Hangzhou at that time is still undecided. Furthermore, Executive Yuan President Wang intends to go from Beijing to Jiangxi within days at the invitation of Chairman Chiang to address the officer corps. The rumor that foreign affairs will be discussed at Lushan is probably not true, etc.</p>
<h3>Liu Eqing and Others Arrive in Shanghai to Urge Yu Youren to Return to Beijing</h3>
<p>Mr. Yu Has Agreed to Depart Within Days</p>
<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, came to Shanghai to see a doctor for an old illness and has been in Shanghai for almost two weeks. Various parties have been suspicious because Mr. Yu has not returned to Beijing for a long time. The Control Yuan held a plenary meeting of all members on the morning of the day before yesterday and appointed members Liu Eqing and Tian Tongjin to come to Shanghai to urge Mr. Yu to return to Beijing to preside over the affairs of the Yuan. Mr. Liu and Mr. Tian arrived in Shanghai by car on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. At 8:15 yesterday morning, they specially went to Jing'an Villa to meet with Mr. Yu and had a cordial conversation for an hour. It is heard that Mr. Yu has agreed to return to Beijing within the next few days. It is certain that Director Yu has been recuperating in Shanghai and has gradually recovered. He will return to Beijing within days and plans to stay in Beijing for a short time before returning to Shaanxi. Yesterday, a local evening newspaper reported that Mr. Yu would go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang after entering Beijing. According to people around Mr. Yu, the President has absolutely no intention of going to Jiangxi and it is probably a mistake based on rumors of going to Shaanxi, etc.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Orders the Salt Affairs Audit Office</h3>
<p>To Formulate Provisional Measures for Handling Salt Certificate Annulment</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to temporarily regulate the handling of salt certificate annulment cases in various regions, has decided to abolish the practice of tax-exempt shipments. However, if losses are indeed due to disasters, they may be exempted. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the Salt Affairs Audit Office of this city, instructing subordinate salt affairs agencies to comply with it. The original order is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Tax-Exempt Shipments Are Resolutely Abolished</h3>
<p>The practice of tax-exempt supplementary shipments for loss of salt certificates in various regions has been completely abolished. This Ministry already issued an order with the number "Salt" 10007 on October 12 of last year, ordering compliance. Since the implementation of this measure, merchants in various regions have repeatedly complained about difficulties and requested changes. Now, after investigation, since supplementary shipments have been explicitly canceled, there is no reason to suspend the implementation. Merchants should be ordered to insure both the tax and fees of the sales area when shipping salt from the salt fields to the sales area and enforce it strictly to fundamentally solve the problem. However, before the insurance measures are planned and implemented, in order to sympathize with the merchants, provisional regulations are formulated. From now on, regardless of whether the salt certificates are lost in various places, regardless of whether it is a sailing vessel or steamer transporting refined or crude salt, and regardless of the cause of the accident, tax-exempt supplementary shipments will not be allowed. The field tax that has been paid will also not be refunded. Those who have not paid the field tax, or have not paid the full amount, must be ordered to pay compensation or make up the difference.</p>
<h3>Exemption for Losses Due to Disaster</h3>
<p>However, if losses are indeed due to disasters, they should be reported to the competent salt affairs agency, verified that they are not fabricated reports, and after verification, the unpaid coastal taxes should be exempted according to the actual amount of salt lost. The guarantee money for the light tax salt catty that was prepaid to pass through heavy tax areas may also be refunded according to the total amount of actual loss. If dilapidated ships are hired, or salt ships that have not been registered by the salt affairs agency are used for transportation, or if the navigation is careless and the measures are inappropriate, resulting in sinking, the coastal taxes must still be compensated and not exempted to show restrictions.</p>
<h3>Reporting Date Limited to Three Days</h3>
<p>For water damage cases, the date of reporting must not exceed three days from the date of the accident, and the date of investigation must not exceed three days from the date of reporting. The date of investigation and reporting must not exceed five days. If a shipowner fabricates a report of water damage, in addition to being ordered to pay compensation at the on-shore sales price according to the reported amount of submerged salt, the shipowner will be permanently dismissed and will not be allowed to transport tax salt. If a merchant fabricates a report of water damage, if it is a ticket merchant transporting the salt himself, the salt ticket should be canceled. If it is a rented ticket for transportation, a fine should be charged according to the ticket book to serve as a warning and prevent fraud.</p>
<h3>Order Merchants to Prepare Insurance and Submit for Approval</h3>
<p>As for the salt certificates that have already been reported but not approved and those that have been approved but not yet transported, there is no need to discuss them again. However, for the sake of equal treatment, all previous cases, if they are indeed water-damaged, should be exempted from coastal taxes to ensure fairness. In addition to issuing separate orders, we hereby urgently order you to comply. You should also properly plan the insurance measures for merchants and submit them for approval. This order.</p>
<h3>Director Wu Liande of the Seaport Quarantine Office Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Visit Liu Ruiheng to Discuss Quarantine Matters</p>
<p>Direct Cholera Is Not Likely to Spread</p>
<p>Wu Liande, the Director of the National Seaport Quarantine Office, recently went to the capital to discuss everything with Liu Ruiheng, the Director of the Department of Health, due to the improper weather and the prevalence of epidemics, which made quarantine matters increasingly tense to prevent problems before they occur. According to Secretary Ye of the office, who spoke to Guowen reporters, except for two people found by the Public Works Department who were proven to have cholera, no three people have been found in this city. If prevention is done properly, it may not spread. However, citizens must pay special attention to their diet and daily life. As for prevention methods, in addition to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, the Health Department of the Public Works Department, the Health Department of the Public Works Department, and the Health Section of the Lianglu Bureau jointly forming a temporary cholera prevention office every summer to publish the work and patient situation at any time, there are also various prevention methods to promote citizens' own awareness. The inspection of imported ships has been extremely strict in recent days, and fortunately, no cases have been found. However, the prevalence of the epidemic is inevitable. The report from various places regarding the epidemic situation is as follows: Place Name Smallpox Meningitis Typhoid Fever Dysentery Scarlet Fever Diphtheria</p>
<p>Shanghai 1 4 22 49 7 6</p>
<p>(4 deaths) (16 deaths) (5 deaths) (2 deaths) (1 death)</p>

<p>Guangzhou 1 11 7 3</p>
<p>Hangzhou 1 1 5 4 (2 deaths)</p>
<p>Hankou 2 11 (3 deaths) 28 1</p>
<p>Nanjing 12 1</p>

<h3>New Rice From Pudong Is on the Market</h3>
<p>│The Rice Quality Is Dry and Clean :: The Selling Price Is 12 Yuan│</p>
<p>The new japonica rice from Pudong in this city was put on the market yesterday, totaling 11 shih. The goods were transported by the Yitai Company of Zhoupu and sold by the Xinchang Rice Mill in the South City after being milled. The rice quality is dry and clean, and the rice color is clear. Because it is the first batch of fresh products, rice shops are competing to purchase it, and the market is quite brisk.</p>
<p>The selling price is 12 yuan. It is heard that there is also a large batch of new japonica rice that will arrive in port one after another. According to rice merchants, although the rice-producing areas in this province have been affected by the severe drought this summer, they have been supplemented by timely rain, so there is no need to worry. The earliest harvest is in the open area. From planting the seedlings to harvesting the rice, it only took 100 days. Therefore, during the severe drought, the rice ears had already emerged and were not harmed at all. The harvest is similar to last year, at 70%. Each mu yields 3.5 dan of rice per year. However, the late rice in the open area is severely affected by shallow and narrow field ditches. However, it all depends on the weather in the future, etc.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sends Two Captains to Set Sail From Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Taking the Granern Ship to London</p>
<p>To Lead the Newly Built Si Hai Ship Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Hai Yuan, Hai Xiang, Hai Li, Hai , and Si Hai ships built by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in England will be completed at the end of September this year.

<h3>The Travel Industry's Aviation Salvation Donation Will Continue to Be Collected Today</h3>
<p>The City's Travel Industry Is Divided Into Five Major Areas</p>
<p>Designated Inspection Officers Are Assigned to Inspect Each Area</p>
<p>The office of the captain of the China Aviation Association held a meeting of representatives of the city's travel industry on the 25th of last month to promote the donation of the travel industry for aviation salvation and discussed promotion measures. It was originally scheduled to continue collecting the donation uniformly on July 10. However, due to the failure to complete various procedures in time, the date was delayed. It is now known that the office has properly completed the various procedures and notified all hotels to continue collecting the donation. The letter to the hotels stated: "We are writing to inform you that the aviation salvation donation for the travel industry in this city has been very smooth and the results have been quite impressive since it began to be collected on April 15. Due to misunderstandings and interference from the authorities in the concession, a small number of hotels have suspended the donation on the pretext of this. This office has submitted a report to the municipal government to negotiate with the authorities of the two concessions, who have understood and agreed not to interfere in such patriotic joint actions in the future. Therefore, this office convened a meeting of representatives of the travel industry in this city on the 25th of last month to discuss promotion measures. After discussion at the meeting, it was decided to continue collecting donations from July 10 in accordance with the original measures, and inspection and collection measures were formulated to avoid hesitation among fellow businesses and affect the progress. Therefore, a copy of the resolutions of the meeting and a copy of the inspection measures are specially copied and sent to you. It is hoped that you will continue to work hard in accordance with the resolutions and in the spirit of the past, so that the travel industry's aircraft can be realized as soon as possible and we can jointly resist foreign aggression. We hope you will pay attention to this matter. Sincerely, Wu Tiecheng, July 24. Attached are a copy of the meeting minutes and a copy of the inspection measures."</p>
<h3>Local Association Implements Planned Work Plan</h3>
<p>The annual work plan of the local association in this city has now been revised and will be implemented step by step. The reporter from Xinsheng News Agency has learned that the association's recent implementation plan is as follows: Guidance on Drought Prevention The rural improvement center run by the Municipal Association originally had the first district of Pudong. Now, the Lixing and Gaoqiao districts have been added. The equipment and mission of each district is to compare the advantages and disadvantages of seeds and the old and new equipment of agricultural products and provide explanations. Especially in the current drought, the association will provide guidance in various ways on the causes of the drought and drought prevention methods, which will directly contribute to the farmers and benefit them greatly.</p>
<p>International Communication The association wants to make international news clear to the general public. Therefore, it follows the plan to establish international communication. Countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Switzerland are all being tested in sequence. The news focuses on rural economy, scientific culture, etc. Currently, the communication method is the postal letter method. In the future, the commercial telegraph code will be expanded. Charitable Undertakings The association has run Guangci Hospital and Zhabei Civilian Rehabilitation Institute. The expenses of these projects will be gradually expanded this year. Therefore, the internal equipment of the two hospitals is gradually improving. The association also pays attention to the future of the civilians in the two hospitals. Therefore, the focus of rehabilitation is on each student leaving the hospital</p>
<h3>All Parties Believe That There Is No Need to Purchase Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>The Hunan Chamber of Commerce Sent a Telegram Expressing Opposition</p>
<p>The Tax Exemption Proposal Is Also Unlikely to Be Realized</p>
<p>After the rice price soared due to the drought, people in the rice industry had a proposal to purchase foreign rice to provide relief. However, after rain fell in various places, the rice price gradually stabilized. Therefore, the purchase of rice is no longer necessary. The Changsha City Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce expressing opposition to the tax exemption for imported foreign rice. At the same time, according to news from the Ministry of Industry, the tax exemption is also impossible. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Attitude of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce of this city, upon receiving</p>
<p>The letter from the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Trade Association</p>
<p>Stated that the high price of rice is due to the obstruction of the river channels</p>
<p>In fact, last year was a year of abundant harvest and the reserves are rich enough to be self-sufficient and have not reached the dangerous stage of a real rice shortage. If foreign rice is purchased, it will inevitably accelerate the bankruptcy of the rural areas. Therefore, please forward it to the party and government organs for prohibition. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the order of foreign rice is a conversation between leaders of the bean and rice industry. Now that rain has been falling in various places, it seems that it is not difficult to remedy the places where rice has been transplanted. According to the rice industry, the domestic deposits are still sufficient for application. It seems that ordering foreign rice is not necessary at present. We will immediately forward the letter from the Miscellaneous Grain Industry to the Bean and Rice Industry Association, asking them to discuss and reply before reviewing and handling it.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Changsha Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Changsha City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Central</p>
<p>Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "We have recently received a report from the</p>
<p>Flower and Grain Industry Trade Association of this city</p>
<p>The report stated that since the implementation of import tax on foreign rice, the sales of domestic rice in Shanghai and other ports have been slightly wider. Although there has not been a significant effect on relieving the rural economy, it has shown a slightly lively sign. However, we received a telegram from Shanghai yesterday stating that the city is experiencing drought and the rice price is rising daily. The rice produced in the city has reached 13 yuan per bag, using the problem of maintaining people's food as an excuse to petition the central government for approval to exempt 500,000 shih of foreign rice from import tax, provided that the rice merchants undertaking the project pay 1.5 yuan for rural recovery fees, so that it can be dumped as much as possible. If approved, the harm would be serious. The drought in various places is definitely not universal. Taking Hunan as an example, the counties along the lake have always been the richest rice-producing areas in the province. Now, the early rice season has arrived and the drought is not harmful. Although the rice price in Shanghai has risen, the highest price of Hunan rice is only more than 9 yuan per shih. A small number of rice merchants in the city are finding it difficult to compete with domestic products due to the increased tax on foreign rice, so they are being deceived by their dangerous words and requests. We should quickly send a telegram to Chen and ask the government to disapprove it so that both farmers and merchants can benefit." It is stated that although the highland areas in various places show signs of drought, the autumn harvest in the low-lying areas is still unaffected. In the future, the surplus will be used to make up for the deficit, which should have no impact on people's food. There is currently no need to exempt foreign rice from import tax. Otherwise, the efforts to relieve rural areas will be abandoned. We hope that everyone will agree and insist on it. Changsha City Chamber of Commerce, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Statement From the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>For the Rural Recovery Committee</p>
<p>The proposal by specialist Gu Xun</p>
<p>To exempt tax on the purchase of 750,000 dan of foreign rice and collect a public welfare fee of 1 yuan per dan as the operating expenses of the chain sales bureau, the tax division's review resulted in the conclusion that there are still points for negotiation in principle. (1) Customs revenue cannot be designated for the management of any business. (2) If you want to exempt taxes, you must exempt taxes universally and cannot designate a certain portion of imports for tax exemption. (3) There is a lot of rice in storage. (4) If Shanghai is short of rice, it should first be purchased domestically. In fact, how to balance the purchase price and the selling price is even more important. If it is for the sake of price stabilization, the loss will be inevitable if it is lower than the original purchase price. But now is not the time. Based on the above reasons, this case has not been approved, and although the foreign rice import tax has not been implemented for long, the established system cannot be changed. China's foreign rice import tax system adopts the so-called sliding standard system. After China's tariff autonomy, this is the first time that this method has been adopted. Minister Kong paid close attention to the implementation of this tax and instructed the Tariff Research Committee to study it at any time. When the Legislative Yuan passed the tax law, there was only the spirit of a sliding standard, but no sliding standard form, because in a completely sliding standard tax system, the maximum and minimum collection amounts must be graded. For example, if a certain item adopts a sliding standard tax system, the tax rate of which grade should be applied at a certain market price. In China's current foreign rice import tax sliding standard system, there are only the maximum and minimum limits, and there is no grading. However, recent research has shown that the import tax can be exempted when the domestic rice price rises above 13 yuan. At the same time, Director Gao stated that (above this 13 yuan) number is not accurate, but only the approximate situation, and the accurate number should be based on the research and publication, etc.</p>

<h3>The Rickshaw Merchants of the Special Zone Held a Representative Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>Resolved That Until the Car Committee Reaches an Understanding</p>
<p>Notify All Members to Unanimously Not Obtain New Licenses</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Industry Association of this city requested the Public Works Department Rickshaw Management Committee to postpone the implementation of the new regulations and requested improvements, but was not allowed. Later, Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and others jointly negotiated with the Car Committee on the issue of postponement and proper planning, but were also rejected. The association specially held a temporary conference in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss solutions. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Representatives Present</h3>
<p>Gu Songmao, Yin Zhiling, Zhang Chunsheng, Mao Chun, Wang Daoxing, Zhou Deyu, Liu Guizhi, Jiang Chunxiang, Lu Bingzhang, Bai Yongan, Chen Jiufu, Duan Changyu, Tang Guangda, Hu Rongkui, Liu Guyun, Sun Shicheng, Gu Naixiang, Ma Fugui, Deng Changsheng, Xue Wenyuan, Feng Buzhou, Sun Zhongchao, and other more than 710 people attended yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Gu Songmao was elected chairman and reported the purpose of the meeting, stating in brief: "The Public Works Department Rickshaw Management Committee reformed the new regulations, and we find it difficult to comply with and implement them. We requested modifications, but were not allowed. Therefore, we also asked Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Cheng Xieshun of the Jianghuai Fellow Association, to ask the Rickshaw Management Committee to transfer the issue for two months, stating that the rickshaw industry is related to the livelihood of 100,000 civilians and that urgency will lead to incidents, but it was not approved. We also proposed to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department to postpone the implementation of the new regulations. However, there are few Chinese Directors and many foreigners on the Board of Directors. The request to withdraw the announcement issued on May 29 and implement it after proper planning was also not approved. If we implement the new regulations, improve the rickshaws, reduce the rickshaw rental, register rickshaw owners, etc., we cannot bear its exploitation. Therefore, we are holding a conference today to discuss solutions, hoping that everyone will express their opinions," etc. Then, Li Ruzhang, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, gave a brief speech.</p>
<h3>Resolutions on Important Cases</h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, discussions began. Many opinions were raised by various parties. The Lian Gen and License cases were discussed on the spot. It was resolved that because the new regulations are harsh and deprive all rickshaw merchants of their rights, unless the bureau understands, they unanimously express their opposition and resolutely refuse to obtain new licenses and refuse to obtain certificates, waiting for public opinion and assistance from all walks of life. A notice was also issued on the spot, stating that all members unanimously refused to obtain new certificates and new licenses, etc.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Notice</h3>
<p>The notice issued on the spot is as follows:</p>
<p>Obtaining a new certificate is to recognize the new regulations. The new regulations are a sharp weapon to destroy rickshaw merchants. If you obtain a new certificate, the rickshaw rental will only be 10 cents per day, and from January 1, it will only be allowed to be 8 cents. Deny the new regulations and be firm. Do not obtain a certificate. If you obtain a certificate, you must change to a chartered car style. After obtaining the certificate, a certificate will not be issued. The rickshaw owner has no right to donate and operate the business. After obtaining the certificate, the Public Works Department will charge an additional 1.5 yuan per month. For the survival of rickshaw owners, do not obtain a certificate. All rickshaw owners should unite and ask society to uphold justice.</p>
<h3>Mailing of Fabric Samples Permitted to Be Tax-Exempt</h3>
<p>The Taxation Department Sent a Letter to the Jianghai Customs</p>
<p>Instructing the Staff Stationed at the Post Office</p>
<p>To Send After Verifying the Certificate</p>
<p>According to Shenshe News Agency, the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Commissioner of Customs of Jianghai yesterday, stating: "According to the joint letter from the Chinese Fabric Factory Association, the letter from the Wing On Textile Company stated that the fabric samples of each factory that are sent to various ports have been approved by the Department to be tax-exempt. When they leave the factory, the staff stationed in the factory will issue a tax-exempt sample certificate to prove it, so that they can be sent by mail. However, recently, the staff stationed at the post office by the Customs did not allow this kind of sample to be sent because it was not tax-exempt. Even if the free certificate was submitted for verification, it would not be effective. Therefore, we are writing to your association, hoping that you will write to the Taxation Department to consult with the Customs and instruct the staff stationed at the post office that, in the future, if this kind of sample is found to be consistent with the items listed in the tax-exempt certificate, they should be allowed to be sent by mail and should not be delayed," etc. It is said that the fabric samples of each factory have been approved by your department to be tax-exempt for a long time. This time, the fabric samples of the Wing On Factory were not allowed to be sent by the staff stationed at the post office by the Customs, or it may be that they are not familiar with the regulations, and the matter is a misunderstanding. For this reason, we sincerely request your department to grant a clear instruction to the Jianghai Customs and instruct the staff stationed at the post office that, in the future, for the fabric samples of each factory, they should be allowed to be sent tax-exempt based on the tax-exempt certificate," etc. According to this, it is found that each yarn factory produces cotton yarn and its directly woven products every year, and there are various samples. When the consolidated tax was opened, the representative of the association stated in writing that they should be exempted from the consolidated tax to show preferential treatment. It was approved by the Ministry that each factory's textile factory with 10,000 spindles is limited to one large package of tax-exempt cotton yarn per year, and each weaving machine with 100 units is limited to 10 bolts of tax-exempt 30-yard or 40-yard cloth per year, and each cotton blanket machine is limited to one piece per year, which has been notified</p>
<p>All subordinate consolidated tax authorities should comply with it. Later, the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui District Bureau reported that recently, each factory often freely transports untaxed fabrics, etc. Once discovered, they often use tax-exempt samples as an excuse, which is easy to cause malpractice. The bureau stipulated two kinds of forms: a sample factory application form and a factory certificate form. From the date of issuance, all kinds of tax-exempt samples should be applied for in writing according to the form, and reported to the resident committee for stamping, registration, and issuance of certificates before they can be released from the factory. This tax-exempt sample should be summarized once a year in a list. If there is an excess, the tax should be supplemented according to the regulations, etc. Please instruct the department after reporting to the department and after review, it has been instructed to approve the implementation. According to the previous letter, it is found that it is still in line with the final decision. In addition to replying to the letter, we hereby request you to investigate and instruct the staff stationed at the post office that, in the future, when the fabric samples of each factory are sent to various foreign ports, they should be sent according to the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui District Bureau's free certificate, verifying that the number of goods is consistent. Please reply as soon as possible. To the Commissioner of Customs of Jianghai, Minister of Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, Qi.</p>
<h3>Dredging of the Eastern Section of the Puhui Pond</h3>
<h3>The Dam Foundation of the Zhongshan Road Bridge Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Songhu Charity Association allocated funds last year to dredge the Puhui Pond in western Shanghai, changing its course to allow for smoother flow. This project was completed some time ago. However, the eastern half of the sixth section (that is, from Pailou Bay eastward, passing Tushan Bay and ending at Xujiahui Town) was temporarily suspended due to a lack of funds. This spring, the municipal government, in order to facilitate navigation, ordered the Public Works Bureau to contract Wang Rongji for the project, which is now completed. The municipal government sent personnel to inspect and accept the dam foundation under the Zhongshan Road Bridge. It was opened to shipping last night, allowing direct access to Xujiahui. Merchants and residents alike are saying that this is very convenient.</p>

<h3>Husband Finds Runaway Wife, Accuses Lover of Disrupting Family</h3>
<h3>Plaintiff and Four Defendants Brought in for Questioning</h3>
<p>Tian Quanfu (32 years old, farmer), a resident of No. 4 Xingxing Lane, Luban Road, Nanshi, came to Shanghai to make a living because of the recent rural economic depression, which made it impossible to support himself. He married a Yao woman (21 years old) from the same village, who was attractive but promiscuous. A month ago, she also came to Shanghai to live with her husband because of hardship. She planned to work to make a living. However, when she was walking in front of the Great World, Zhou Tongfu from Yangzhou, who lived at No. 16 Anqing Lane, Nanshi, and Li Shiyun from Shandong, who owned a dyeing shop at No. 802 Road, along with Zhou's young son, approached her. Seeing that Tian Yao was young and beautiful, they used sweet words to lure her to the Great World. That night, Li Shiyun tricked her into opening a room in a hotel, where they expressed their mutual admiration and regretted not meeting sooner. Then, they found another residence in a certain place in Nanshi to keep her hidden. However, after Tian Quanfu's wife suddenly disappeared, he asked people to look for her without success. Until about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Tian learned of Li's residence and reported the information to the Second District Yuyuan Road Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, accusing Li and others of disrupting his family and seduction. The Second District dispatched police to the address and brought the defendants Li Shiyun, Zhou Tongfu, and the victim Tian Yao, along with the plaintiff, to the station for questioning. Plaintiff Tian Quanfu stated the above in his testimony. Defendant Li Shiyun testified that Tian Yao was introduced to him as a lover by Zhou Tongfu, and he did not seduce her. Zhou Tongfu testified that he was falsely accused and denied seduction. District Chief Li, considering the case involved disruption of family, ordered them to be sent to the General Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>

It was sailing to the Zhang Huabang Grain and Rice Stack Wharf in Songnan when the Japanese merchant ship "Xiangyang Maru," exporting from Shanghai, arrived at the same location.

<h3>Using Poisonous Liquid Under the Guise of Curing Illness for Extortion</h3>
<h3>Showing Poisonous Substances After Giving Medicine, Intentions Obvious</h3>
<h3>Sick Woman Alarmed, Calls Police to Take Him to Court</h3>
<p>Around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Kang Shi Quan from Qingjiang, only 18 years old, carrying a leather bag resembling a medicine box, claimed to be a doctor who could cure various diseases and was soliciting business along Gelan Road in Pudong. At that time, a woman named Tang Qu, residing in a bungalow on Gelan Road, happened to be suffering from a headache. Hearing that Kang could cure it, she invited him into her room. Seeing that the woman was easily deceived, Kang used his trick. From the leather bag, he strangely produced a glass bottle with paper pasted on it. He opened the bottle and poured out half a cup of liquid, asking her to drink it, saying it would immediately cure her headache. After she drank it, Kang immediately asked her what she had just drunk. She said she didn't know. Kang then tore off the paper from the bottle, revealing that it was full of poisonous substances, including a small snake, a centipede, and geckos, etc. The woman was greatly shocked. She immediately told her husband, Tang Fuchang, to grab Kang. Knowing that his extortion had failed and the matter was about to fail, Kang told the Tang couple that he could prescribe medicine to detoxify the poisonous liquid. The Tangs refused and immediately called the police, who took Kang and his leather bag to the Yangshupu Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, the police sent Kang to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District. Jiang Baolian, the police lawyer, stated the above situation, saying that although the victim Tang Qu was in Shengxin Hospital, she had not yet been examined by a doctor to determine if she was in danger. Moreover, Kang Shi Quan's carrying of such poisonous substances was a threat to public health. Therefore, he requested permission for Kang's detention for investigation. Kang Shi Quan's testimony was evasive. Judge Deng Baosun ordered Kang to be detained for seven days to investigate before questioning him again.</p>

<h3>Chen Zhenya's Deceptive Escape Plan</h3>
<h3>Claiming to Be Abducted by Thugs</h3>
<h3>Police Station Investigates and Reports for Review</h3>
<p>Chen Zhenya, the director of the Dongwu Sanatorium Hospital at No. 99 Jisi Fei'er Road in western Shanghai, was suddenly abducted by three thugs posing as court investigators at around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday and driven away in a car at high speed. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Chen Zhenya was actually trapped in the hospital and unable to escape, so he came up with this clever plan to escape. The truth of the matter is recorded below. When Chen Zhenya was preparing to open the sanatorium hospital, he first recruited over 40 staff members for each department, each paying a security deposit ranging from 100 to 200 yuan. After the opening, he opened a nursing school in the hospital, recruiting over 20 students, each paying tuition, room, board, and miscellaneous fees of 86 yuan. The total collected was over 9,000 yuan. However, before the hospital had been open for a month, the staff members, after discussing it, felt that the director was completely relying on the security deposits to operate the hospital and suspected him of fraud. They unanimously demanded that the director return the security deposits when they resigned. Director Chen, because the funds had been used to purchase hospital assets and cover all expenses, could not raise the money immediately and tried to appease the staff members. The staff members, seeing his insincerity, repeatedly pressed him. Last Sunday, Director Chen reported the matter to the Sixth District, and Director Tan sent Inspector Long to persuade the staff members, promising to raise the money after Director Chen recovered from his illness. However, the staff members filed a lawsuit in court and kept Director Chen under guard in the hospital, not allowing him to leave. For several days, Chen devised a clever plan, colluding with three thugs to help him escape. At the time, the staff members saw that the three thugs were imposing, so they did not dare to resist. After investigation, they realized they had been fooled. After learning of this, Director Tan of the Sixth District sent Inspectors Cheng and Long to investigate. Yesterday morning, Inspectors Long Jianpo and Liu Pei went to the hospital to inventory all the assets and equipment, making a list to report to the director for review. Yesterday, the staff members were still gathered in the hospital, looking very anxious.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Discusses Improving Public Transportation</h3>
<h3>Believes It Should Consult with the Municipal Government and the French Concession</h3>
<h3>And Inquire with the Tram Company on How to Improve</h3>
<p>At the last meeting of the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Bureau, a memorandum submitted by the Director of Public Works regarding public transport within the Settlement was considered. Except for the issues concerning traffic, which should be studied by both the Transport and Public Bus sectors, regarding the improvement of trams, there is no deadline for the tram franchise agreement, but at the end of the thirty-fifth year (i.e. 1940) or every seven years thereafter, the Public Works Bureau may purchase the company at a publicly assessed market price with six months' notice. Therefore, if the Public Works Bureau does not make any statement, it seems difficult for the company to make any large-scale expansion. The Public Works Bureau should first determine what improvements are needed. Although the tram system has been abandoned in many other places, it is difficult to find a satisfactory alternative for this city for the time being. As for elevated railways, it is impossible if they are only set up for the Settlement, and elevated railways will inevitably lead to more people gathering in a few locations, making traffic more difficult. A committee member then asked if high-speed trams could be operated on Avenue Edward VII. The Director of Public Works said that this could not be done because there was an agreement between the two concessions. One of the proposals in the Director's memorandum was to convert trams to double-decker trackless trams, connecting them with the existing trackless lines. A committee member asked what advantages trackless trams had over double-decker buses. The Director of Public Works replied that the latter had higher operating expenses. The committee members believed that trams and buses should cooperate, not compete. This matter should establish an agreement between the three parties. Someone then suggested that ways should be found to consult and cooperate with the French Concession and the Municipal Government to improve. For example, the current traffic connections in the three districts are extremely lacking. The Director of Public Works also believed that if everyone discussed the matter openly, useful ideas might be obtained. The north-south traffic lines are currently limited to the central district and should be extended to the western district. Also, the connection between the current trams and trackless trams needs to be improved. If the tram tracks on the Bund can be moved closer to the river, the Waibaidu Bridge can be rebuilt and widened to 80 feet. Regarding the operation of double-decker trams on the existing tracks, the Director of Public Works did not agree because the tracks were too narrow. As for trackless trams, because they can stop by the side of the road, they can reduce traffic obstruction. However, in fact, because of rickshaws, trackless trams still cannot run close to the side of the road. Also, trams need overhead lines, so the rear car cannot overtake the front car, which is a disadvantage compared to buses. After discussion, the committee members unanimously agreed that improving public transportation should start with initial contact with the Municipal Government and the French Concession, and the tram company should be asked what preparations it has made for improving equipment. Extending the current routes is also important, but this depends on the outcome of negotiations with neighboring districts.</p>
<h3>Bus Crashes into Clinic</h3>
<h3>Driver's Carelessness Causes Major Disaster</h3>
<h3>Passengers Injured by Impact</h3>
<p>A British-owned Tenth Road bus, which runs between Caojiadu and Xiangxiang, was traveling on West Huade Road at the intersection of Naxun Road yesterday morning around 10:00 AM when the engine suddenly malfunctioned on bus number 15021. The driver, number 119, got out of the bus to inspect and restarted the engine, but forgot to apply the brakes. As the engine started, the bus lurched forward, and the driver jumped aside. The bus crashed into the clinic of the Tongren Hospital, demolishing the front door and walls. The driver, realizing the potential for a major disaster, quickly jumped back onto the bus and applied the brakes. However, four passengers on board, Wang Chaosheng, 48, from Changzhou, Du Haiming, 28, Li Xingsheng, 24, from Pudong, a Mr. Zhu from Changzhou, and the bus conductor, number 125, were injured when their heads hit the interior due to the sudden violent impact. The nearby police arrived to investigate and sent the injured to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Liu Chongwu and Others Retried, Support Groups Plan Rescue Again</h3>
<h3>Believe Sentence is Still Too Heavy</h3>
<h3>Decide to Request Special Amnesty from Central Government</h3>
<p>Patriotic individuals Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songsheng, Tian Shuiyang, etc. were sentenced to imprisonment. After the Aid Patriotic Individuals Committee hired lawyers Ma Junshuo, Zhang Shizhao, Yu Hualong, etc. to appeal to the Supreme Court, the case was sent back for retrial. On the 26th, the sentence was announced: Liu Chongwu was reduced to seven years of imprisonment, Tian Shuiyang and Pan Hongsheng were sentenced to six years of imprisonment each, and Cao Songsheng was still sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. Cao Songsheng declared his dissatisfaction in court and will appeal again. The families of Pan Hongsheng and others went to the Aid Committee yesterday to request relief. The committee believes that the sentence is still too heavy and should be rescued. Therefore, it has decided to convene a temporary emergency meeting next Monday (the 30th) at 2:00 PM to discuss rescue methods and convene a joint meeting of various groups to send representatives to petition the Central Government to request special amnesty.</p>
<h3>Shanghai to Increase Car Tax Rate, to Be Implemented This Winter</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, there are reports of an increase in car tax rates in the city. A reporter visited the financial authorities and was informed of the general situation as follows: The roads in the city have been expanding year by year, and most of the road construction and maintenance costs are paid from various income items. The only income related to roads is the car tax. If the income from car tax alone is used to offset the expenses of road construction and maintenance, it will not be possible to achieve the current level of progress. The construction of suburban roads in the city does not generate tax revenue in the surrounding areas, resulting in significant losses. In contrast, roads in the special zone are all located in prosperous areas, and the property and land taxes in the surrounding areas can increase simultaneously once the roads are built. The difference between the two is like heaven and earth. Therefore, the city's car tax rate increase is lower than that of the special zone. For example, for private passenger cars, the special zone charges 15 taels of silver per year (equivalent to 21 yuan), while the city only charges 15 silver dollars. The difference is in the ratio of 14 to 10. If calculated based on commercial passenger cars, two special zones must pay taxes separately in order to pass, and the difference is even greater. Last year, the highways of the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shanghai, and Ningbo were completed, allowing cars to travel to each other. There are no less than 2,100 kilometers of highways and roads in the five provinces and cities that are licensed to use the city's license plates. There are only more than 360 kilometers that are licensed to use the special zone license plates. If the length of road usage is compared, the tax rate is even more different. Since various cars can make full use of their milk production, the increase in tax rate is a natural evolution. After the city increases the tax rate, plus an additional 10% of the inter-provincial and municipal automobile surtax, it is still less than the amount charged by the special zone. The plan to increase the surtax has been approved by the Municipal Government and passed by the Provisional Senate, and approved by the superior authorities. It can be implemented this winter.</p>
<h3>City Ferry Evening Cruises to Feature Ancient Music Tonight and Tomorrow</h3>
<h3>The Moon is Bright, the Breeze is Clear, and the Ancient Music Sounds</h3>
<h3>Passengers on the River Are Very Fortunate</h3>
<p>The Municipal Ferry Management Office of the Shanghai Xingye Trust Company, given the recent return to sultry weather and the surge in evening cruise passengers, has specially requested the Orchestra to perform Chinese ancient music on the No. 5 ferry to Wusong tonight and tomorrow night to enhance the interest of the cruise passengers. The group has been established for nine years and has a reputation in Shanghai. They have repeatedly performed at Western music concerts and received great honor.

The program for tonight, and the time required, are: (1) Siamese Poem (5 minutes); (2) Xunyang Nocturne (12 minutes); (3) Huaiyin Pingchu (20 minutes); (4) Pu'an Mantra (18 minutes), totaling about one hour. Members of the group, such as Li Tingsong, Li Zhenjia, Yu Yeting, Sun Yude, Gong Zixian, and Su Tanyang, are all music experts and extraordinary. This is a rare opportunity to volunteer on the Huangpu River. The moon will be beautiful for consecutive nights, and the breeze on the Huangpu River will be refreshing. The passengers on the boat will be able to listen to beautiful music and feel happy in body and mind. It is expected that the tourists will be very crowded for tonight.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Public Works Bureau Requesting No Fines for Licensed Vendors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you regarding a matter reported to the association by Hong Achu and Wang Shouning, representatives of all licensed vendors of food in the vegetable markets within the Settlement. They stated that they are small-scale vendors who rely on their licenses to support their families. However, recently, vendors selling Western socks have been mixed in, leading to arrests and fines, causing great hardship. They are requesting relief. We have been operating our businesses selling fruits and vegetables in the special zone, carrying our goods and selling with licenses for several years without any problems. Recently, a group of vagrants have been shouting and selling Western socks along the roads without licenses. They block the road and run away when the police arrive, causing licensed vendors approved by the Public Works Bureau to be innocently implicated, arrested, and fined. We requested your association to send a letter to the Public Works Bureau to arrest them, and we had a few days of peace. However, the police are still driving around on the roads arresting us three to five times a day, making it impossible for us to operate our businesses. We have no way to think, and we have discussed going to the Citizens' Federation to petition. Mr. Zhang Xianfang of the Federation received us and reported on our suffering. According to Mr. Zhang, this matter was reported to the police by the Second District Branch of the Special Zone Citizens' Association. Therefore, the police drove around arresting us. For this reason, the entire group of vendors sent representatives Hong Achu and Wang Shouning to the Second District Branch to request that they send a letter to the police to exempt us from arrest. We went back and forth five or six times, but we did not meet the person in charge or the director. The petition was entrusted to the tea room in the association to forward, but there has been no reply. We can only ask your association to quickly send a letter to the Public Works Bureau, ordering the police stations to stop arresting small fruit and vegetable vendors on the roads. Because we are small businesses and earn only meager profits, we rely on them to support our families. We can only sit and wait for death. Therefore, we earnestly request your speedy assistance in this matter, kneeling down to receive your reply, and we are deeply grateful. Please have compassion to save the lives of over a thousand people. The letter has arrived at the association and is being verified. According to the reply letter from the Second District Branch of the First Special Zone Citizens' Federation of Shanghai to the vendors' petition, it states: 'We received your letter yesterday and learned about your situation. This association previously acted on the request of members to ban vendors who obstruct traffic in front of their doors and cheat customers. Therefore, this association forwarded a letter to the Public Works Bureau requesting that they be banned in order to maintain the business of our members and eliminate obstructions in front of their doors. The vendors you mentioned, having already obtained licenses, should know the Public Works Bureau's vendor regulations and not obstruct the business of the members of this association. Now that you are being implicated by unscrupulous vendors, your situation is regrettable. Please directly petition the Public Works Bureau for relief. This association has no authority to intervene.' The license issued by the Public Works Bureau's Tax Affairs Department is a special certificate of permission to operate a business. Now, the police stations under your administration arrest vendors with or without licenses on the roads. In fact, it is no different from directly punishing the offices under a unified administrative agency. With this contradictory action, how will your Bureau justify itself? In view of the above, we are sending a letter to your Bureau requesting that you immediately order the police stations not to fine licensed vendors, lest the weak and law-abiding people are forced to take risks. Respectfully submitted to the Director of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau."</p>

<h3>Accurate News of the Catholic Charities Association Taking Over the Zhabei Civilian Training Institute</h3>
<h3>The Zhabei Civilian Training Institute was originally the site of the Jieqin Institute. After the January 28th Incident, it was full of ruins, and vagrants gathered there, causing local problems. The Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association, in view of this, decided to establish a Civilian Training Institute in Zhabei to accommodate them. It allocated 100,000 silver dollars from the National Salvation Donation as a foundation. When the Shanghai Local Cooperation Association was established, it continued to raise funds and organized a board of directors, electing Shi Liangcai as the chairman of the board, Qian Xinzhi, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Gongquan, Lin Kanghou, Wang Yiting, Chen Bingqian, and Hu Yunqiu as the economic directors, Jiang Wenyu, Huang Renzhi, and Gao Yanyun as the education directors, Yan Fang, Lu Bohong, Zhang Lin, Wang Yaozhuang, Shen Lianfang, Xu Qianlin, and Wang Bin Yan and Zhang Xiaoliang as the livelihood directors, Hu Yunqiu as the president of the institute, and Gao Yanyun as the vice president of the institute. They allocated funds to build hundreds of new houses on the old site of the Jieqin Institute, which covered more than 80 acres of land on Liuying Road. It was completed last spring. Wang Yiting transferred more than 170 homeless people from the Shanghai South Shelter, the China Relief Society for Women and Children transferred 20 male students, combined with the original homeless people of the Jieqin Institute, and the institute successively accommodated a total of more than 200 people. For the past two years, there have been advances and retreats. As of now, there are still more than 140 students in the institute.</h3>
<h3>Reasons for the Takeover</h3>
<h3>The 100,000 yuan foundation of the institute is deposited in the savings association of the Four Banks, with an annual interest rate of 9%, paid every six months. The institute's expenses were previously more than 20,000 yuan per year, and it has not been reduced much. Over the years, it has been difficult to raise funds, and it has been forced to use 20,000 yuan of the foundation. Also, since the future is long and the subsidy is too large, the prospect is difficult to maintain. Therefore, due to economic problems, the board of directors of the institute decided to ask the China Catholic Charities Association to take over. The president of the institute, Hu Yunqiu, was given full authority to discuss everything with Wang Guanyi, the representative of the Catholic Charities Association. After the plan was agreed upon by both parties, it was approved by the 66th Executive Committee of the Catholic Charities Association. August 1st was the official takeover period. It was tentatively emphasized that the takeover period was two years. During the period, the Catholic Charities Association had</h3>

<p>Two Postal Unions Telegraph Request for Correction</p>
<p>The Two Postal Unions Yesterday Telegraphed the Ministry, Stating: Zhu Xunmin, Minister of Transportation and Communications in Nanjing, Recently Reported from Various Locations That Since the Directorate General of Telecommunications and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Have Signed a Revenue and Expenditure Contract, the Telegraph Bureau's Revenue Is Collected by the Savings and Remittance Bureau, and All Expenses of the Telegraph Bureau Are Paid by the Savings and Remittance Bureau. However, the National Telegraph Administration's Monthly Expenses Exceed Revenue by Approximately 500,000 Yuan. This Amount Is Overdrafted from the Savings and Remittance Bureau Monthly. The News Has Caused Shock. The Savings and Remittance Bureau's Deposits Are the People's Hard-Earned Money and Not State Funds. The Use of Savings Funds Should Be Handled Carefully in Accordance with Postal Savings Regulations. Now, the Savings and Remittance Authorities Are Granting the Telegraph Bureau a Huge Overdraft Without Obtaining Reliable Security from the Telegraph Administration, Which Is Imprudent in the Use of Postal Savings Funds. The Associations Believe That This Matters Greatly to the People's Hard-Earned Savings, and We Special Telegraphically Request Your Excellency to Correct the Inappropriate Aspects of the Postal and Telegraph Revenue and Expenditure Contract to Protect Savings Funds and Maintain the Postal Service.

<h3>Scientific Rainmaking and Setting Up Altars to Pray for Rain (Continued)</h3>
<p>—Answer to Mr. Zhu Ming—</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the principle of scientific rainmaking.</p>
<p>The formation of rain is due to the condensation of water vapor in the air. The air contains water vapor at all times and in all places, but at a certain temperature, it can only contain a certain amount of water vapor. If this amount is exceeded, the water vapor may condense. The higher the temperature, the more water vapor it can contain. For example, at 10 degrees Celsius, each cubic meter of air can only contain a maximum of 9.36 grams of water vapor, while at 20 degrees Celsius, it can contain 17.15 grams of water vapor. When the water vapor reaches this maximum limit, it is called "saturated humidity." If the humidity exceeds the saturated state, it can condense into fog. Clouds are a type of fog. When the clouds in the sky are very dense, it indicates that a large amount of water vapor has condensed in the sky, and as a result, it will naturally turn into rain and fall.</p>
<p>Normally, the temperature of the air near the ground is always slightly higher than the temperature of the air in the upper atmosphere. Therefore, the air near the ground can contain more water vapor than the air in the upper atmosphere. If the temperature of the air near the ground, which has not reached the saturated state, rises to the upper atmosphere, it will become saturated as the temperature drops, and it will condense into clouds in the upper atmosphere. In this particularly hot weather this year, the temperature in the upper atmosphere will not be very low, so the condensation of water vapor is also more difficult. Therefore, clouds and rain are very scarce, creating the current drought.</p>
<p>Thus, the principle of scientific rainmaking is nothing more than these two key points: First, to saturate the humidity in the upper atmosphere, and second, to condense this saturated humidity. This principle is simple to state but difficult to do. Because rainmaking must be done on a large scale, that is, it must be able to affect a very wide range in the upper atmosphere. This method is very difficult. The United States has previously successfully made rain by dispersing electrically charged sand with airplanes, but because the range that can be affected is not large, it is still not suitable for practical use. The current Soviet method can produce rain on an area of one square kilometer for up to 45 minutes, which is much more advanced than the American method. However, it is said that the cost is very high, so there is still room for improvement.</p>
<p>The Soviet rainmaking method has not been published in detail, so we do not know the specifics of their technology, but the principle will definitely not be different from what we have said. According to reports, a special gas is dispersed using chemical methods, and the purpose is to promote the humidity in the upper atmosphere to become saturated. In addition, strong electrical discharges are carried out. The purpose of performing electrical discharges is to make the saturated humidity condense quickly, because even if the humidity in the air exceeds the saturated state, it will not condense by itself for a while unless it touches a solid or is subjected to a vibrating force. The American sand distribution and the Soviet electrical discharge are both carried out in this sense. Also, when discharging electricity, a large number of electrons must pass through the space, and saturated water vapor has a characteristic: that is, the condensation speed is the fastest around the path through which the electrons pass, so the actions of electrically charged sand and electrical discharge can promote condensation. In recent years, scientists have used the characteristic that water vapor condenses around electrons to take pictures of the interlocking shapes of electrons with cameras. The very fine electrical particles that cannot be seen no matter what are actually made visible. This confirms Engels' saying: The progress of science can transform the "thing-in-itself" into a "thing for mankind." That is to say, the practice of science deepens mankind's ability to recognize. The things that were originally hidden inside the substance itself (i.e., the thing-in-itself) are revealed and controlled by mankind thanks to science. (The End)</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Gift of Summer</h3>
<p>— Nangong</p>
<p>This summer, the heat is the highest in sixty years. The asphalt on the roads is almost melted into liquid. The sun, like a fiery umbrella, hangs in the sky, causing pedestrians on the street to sweat like rain, soaking their clothes. Even inside houses, invaded by the heat, everything seems to be soaked in boiling water, so hot that one cannot settle down. In this kind of hot weather, things like ice cream, soda, fresh orange juice, and watermelon have become the only wonderful products to relieve the heat. However, most people only know that in the height of summer, ice is a gift of summer, but they are not very clear about the source of ice.</p>
<p>Now, there are two types of ice traded in the market: one is manufactured ice, and the other is natural ice. Artificial ice is made with ice-making machinery, using distilled water and electricity. The cold air condenses the distilled water into ice, so it is white, clean, transparent, and neat. It can be used as a drink, such as iced water, shaved ice, and other things. Because the ice is made of distilled water, it is very hygienic, and drinking it will not cause disease. It is a type of ice cube for drinks. However, because it requires machinery, electricity, and labor during the manufacturing process, the cost is naturally not low, so it is several times more expensive than natural ice. Poor families cannot easily obtain it. Therefore, artificial ice has become a modern and expensive product.</p>
<p>The source of natural ice is when it is extremely cold and ice forms in winter. People break the ice into pieces, gather it in one place, and store it in an icehouse to prevent it from melting. In the summer, it is taken out of the icehouse for use. The ice formed in the winter river is a natural product that does not require the purchase of capital. As long as an icehouse is built, the cost is very low. However, because it is taken from the river, it is naturally not hygienic. Although the price is low, it cannot be used as a drink. It can only be used to freeze things. The ice used in ordinary refrigerators is this kind of natural ice. The shape is broken and unsightly, and there is a lot of mud mixed in it. It is far from as good-looking and bright as artificial ice. However, using it to freeze food in the summer is much more useful than artificial ice.</p>
<p>The construction of an icehouse involves digging a cellar more than ten feet deep in the ground. The top is surrounded by a foot-thick layer of sod to create a large room. In the winter, the ice is taken and stored in the cellar. Because the sod around it does not allow air to pass through, heat cannot invade the inside, and the sun cannot shine into the room, the stored ice will not melt even after a year and a half. It is still the same as when it was stored, and it can be taken out for use in hot weather.</p>
<p>Before artificial ice was invented, there was only natural ice on the market in the summer. No one had discovered artificial ice. Therefore, in every town and city, there were always one or two icehouses built in the fields. Now, not only has artificial ice gradually occupied the position of natural ice, but there is also the equipment of cold storage rooms. I am afraid that in a few years, natural ice will gradually be eliminated and will no longer be seen on the market.</p>
<h3>Cool Breeze Cave</h3>
<p>— Drunken Madman</p>
<p>My hometown, Zhuji, has become convenient for transportation since the opening of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road. Therefore, several scenic spots that had been hidden and unheard of, such as Wuxie and other places, have gradually been admired and visited by people from other provinces. But there is still a small summer resort that people from other places do not know. Now, taking advantage of this hot weather, I will reveal it: All Hangzhou-Jiangshan travelers, if they are interested in exploring the secluded, may as well take a detour to visit and appreciate the wonders here.</p>
<p>About ten kilometers away from Zhuji City, there is Wai Chen Town. The area is covered with forests, and the scenery is quiet and secluded. In the depths of the stream and mountains, there is a cave that is about five feet in diameter and several feet deep. The local name is called "Cool Breeze Cave" because in the summer, cool breezes blow through the cave. People who enter it feel a biting cold. Even in the hottest weather, one must wear cotton or lined clothes. Inside, the rocks are jagged, and there are stone tables and stone benches for resting. Therefore, every year in the summer, people who go there in groups are endless. During this time, the locals often open tea houses and restaurants to meet the needs of tourists. Some people bring their own wine and food to drink and chat together in the cave, and they can also eat frozen trotters and frozen chicken. This is because they bring pre-cooked braised trotters or chicken inside. After only an hour or so, they will freeze. This natural frozen food has a unique flavor. It is naturally incomparable to the agar-agar frozen chicken sold in the market. Therefore, some people say that although the climate in summer resorts such as Mogan Mountain and Guling is cool, they do not have the degree of eating frozen trotters and frozen chicken. This is something worth appreciating and marveling at!</p>
<p>According to Wai Chen Town, there are about 300 households of residents. There are many villages nearby, which are traversed by the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. But there is no station set up. It is a pity. In my opinion, with such a scenic line, it is necessary to add a station to facilitate travelers. And I hope that the Railway Bureau will rise up and implement it.</p>
<h3>Watermelon Juice</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Watermelon is really a top-quality product for relieving heat and quenching thirst in summer.</p>
<p>Naturally, modern fashionable ladies and gentlemen regard iced lian, iced soda as gifts, firstly because the taste is sweeter, and secondly because it is cool and delicious. In fact, I think artificial cold drinks, although the taste is more sweet and beautiful, but no matter what, they are often rich in greasy properties – the tongue always feels sticky, far less than the clean fragrance of watermelon. Moreover, artificial manufacturing, although using scientific methods to manufacture, steam and disinfect, and then the health authorities inspect, but there are always omissions, and we really find it difficult to believe that artificial cold drinks absolutely do not contain microorganisms that are harmful to the health of workers. As for watermelon, then I dare to pat my chest to guarantee, because what watermelon contains is the sugar quality transformed by the organic body in watermelon, and the water that has been filtered in the watermelon vine, which is absolutely beneficial and harmless to any part of the human body.</p>
<p>Although watermelon is superior to cold drinks, it is inconvenient to carry, and the skin is easy to be crushed, which is inevitably a fly in the ointment. Therefore, here, I have a suggestion to imitate the method of fresh orange juice, squeeze the watermelon juice, and use scientific methods to put it into glass bottles, then, I think it will definitely be very popular among ladies and gentlemen. Because the selling price of watermelon in the producing area is very low, and it can be used to squeeze juice, the cost is cheaper than any cold drink, and this thing is very suitable for the taste of ordinary people. The future sales prospect will definitely surpass all cold drinks and be above it.</p>
<p>In this year of promoting national products, I hope that industrialists will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>— Gu Pu</p>
<p>The hot summer has quietly arrived. The thermometer rises above 100 degrees.</p>
<p>The sun wields supreme authority, hanging high in the sky like a ball of fire, scorching everything in nature. People's clothes are soaked in sweat, and even breathing is tense and rapid.</p>
<p>"Lao Yu, let's go swimming!" Someone asked their companion, Lao Yu.</p>
<p>"Okay! Let's go swimming!"</p>
<p>"I'm going too!" Xiao Yang chimed in.</p>
<p>So the three of them took their swimsuits, jumped on a public bus, and headed for the Hongkou Swimming Pool.</p>
<p>At the entrance, they paid the price of swimming – four dimes per person.</p>
<p>Running into the locker room, the clothes inside were intertwined and messy like a laundry.</p>
<p>Changing into their swimsuits, everyone went into the water. Chinese and foreign men and women crowded the pool. Those who could swim jumped off the platform, and those who couldn't wore life preservers.</p>
<p>Several misses, although they couldn't swim, sat in the shallow water, asking people to take a few photos of their curvy beauty.</p>
<p>Tired, they lay on the grass, enjoying a sun massage.</p>
<p>When the scorching sun lost its power and fell listlessly to the west, everyone changed their clothes and walked out of the gate of the Hongkou Swimming Pool, with cool hearts and bodies.</p>
<h3>Consolation in the Summer Heat</h3>
<p>— A Subtle Pen</p>
<p>The sun, like a blazing fire, shines upon the world. The pedestrians on the road are sparse, only a few rickshaw pullers, with sweat beading like soybeans, laboriously pull empty vehicles on the melting asphalt road, slowly and painfully. I sit alone in my room, still sweating profusely, too lazy to do anything. "Mr. X, a letter!" From the hand of the tea server, I glance at the elegant handwriting and know it is from my wife. In this intense heat, to receive a longed-for letter is more refreshing and pleasant than drinking ten cups of ice cream! In that instant, it seems my sweat has stopped flowing, and I focus all my attention on reading:</p>
<p>"Last Sunday you told us that because of the heat, you wouldn't be coming home. I was quite happy with that, because in this hot weather, excessive labor can easily lead to heatstroke. However, when that day arrived, I somehow still foolishly hoped for your return. I knew you would be very hot when you arrived home, so I specially bought a few bottles of soda, ready for you to drink as soon as you got here. When I was cooking, I made the dinner portions a bit more generous, knowing that you usually come in the afternoon, but they don't know about it, and I was afraid they would laugh at me. X, my dear X, though I understand that this action will ultimately lead to my disappointment!</p>
<p>The weather this year is indeed terribly hot. If it is still hot next Sunday, I think you shouldn't risk coming home in the heat. What if you get heatstroke? But I, on the other hand, hope you come. I hope that when you come, you won't rush out as you have in the past. I hope you can stay home, enjoy the cool, have pleasant conversations, and enjoy the blessings of summer…"</p>
<p>What a touching letter! She worries that I will suffer and get heatstroke on the way home; yet, out of concern, she hopes for my return. Her wording is hesitant, but my course of action is clear. This Sunday, regardless of the heat or heavy rain, I am determined to go home and, furthermore, determined to listen to her and not rush out again.</p>
<p>The harmony of a couple is indeed the most pleasant thing in life. Everyone hopes to enjoy a fulfilling life but does not realize that a fulfilling life is built on a harmonious family. One who cannot manage a family will naturally be seeking the impossible if they wish to enjoy family happiness. In this intensely hot weather, all sorts of iced drinks can be bought with money, but a loving letter from a beloved wife is something money cannot buy. Therefore, in my reply, I proudly wrote these two sentences:</p>
<p>"You have indeed become a good wife. I am still ashamed and wondering how I can strive to become a good husband!"</p>

<p>Small Recipes</p>
<h3>Summer Food</h3>
<p>— Wu Men Sha Yu</p>
<p>In this arid and exceptionally hot time, special attention must be paid to diet! One careless mistake can easily lead to catching a plague. As the saying goes, "Disease enters through the mouth." Therefore, serious attention must be paid to summer food. Now, let's briefly review the subject of summer food.</p>
<h3>Drinks</h3>
<p>In this environment of sweating profusely, drinks are the most urgently needed food for everyone. The most modern cold drinks are undoubtedly paper-colored ice cream. However, this kind of ice cream has too little juice, is too expensive, and is too greasy to truly quench thirst! The best thirst-quenching drinks are, of course, fresh orange juice, soda water, carbonated drinks, and ice cream. However, the price of each cup or bottle is always around twenty cents, which, in these times of expensive rice and firewood, seems too unaffordable for the common people. Sour plum soup and mung bean jelly, although cheap and refreshing, are mostly made with raw water, which is not hygienic. The most hygienic drinks are the floral extracts sold in pharmacies; the water is clean, the taste is fragrant, and lotus flower extract can dispel summer heat, rose extract can stimulate the appetite, and honeysuckle extract can detoxify, etc., making them superior to ordinary drinks. However, they are a bit more expensive. Ordinary drinks are mainly cold artemisia or chrysanthemum tea.</p>
<h3>Melons and Fruits</h3>
<p>Summer is originally a season of abundant melons and fruits. There are watermelons, cantaloupes, muskmelons, winter melons, loofahs, etc. Watermelon is a wonderful product for dispelling summer heat. It has abundant sweet juice, and after being chilled in a well or refrigerator, it is sweet, cold, and delicious, more satisfying than any cold drink. Loofah and winter melon are both excellent vegetarian dishes. Winter melon cooked with salted pork is a seasonal delicacy in summer; it is fresh but not greasy, and extremely palatable. Besides melons, there are also lotus and peaches, etc. Lotus is divided into four parts: flower, leaves, lotus seeds, and roots. The petals can be fried, the fresh leaves can be used in cooking (such as steamed chicken wrapped in lotus leaves), lotus seeds and roots can be eaten raw, lotus seeds can also be used in medicine, and lotus roots, in addition to being made into various vegetarian dishes, can be cut into thin strips and mixed with sugar and vinegar, which is also a delicious appetizer.</p>
<h3>Dishes</h3>
<p>Although "thunder showers" are superstition, large chunks of fatty meat are indeed not suitable for the appetite in the exceptionally hot summer. Summer dishes aim for cleanliness, freshness, and crispness. Among vegetarian dishes, mushrooms are the best, and among meat dishes, spring chicken is the most outstanding and seasonal. Mushrooms can be used in soup, and chicken can be braised or stewed. Chicken cubes stir-fried with green chili and eggplant, and shredded chicken mixed with cold mung bean sheets are even more refreshing and delicious. Besides chicken, duck is also a seasonal delicacy. The braised duck from Suzhou Songhelou Restaurant is only sold in June; its taste is fresh, tender, and sweet, and it is a unique delicacy of Suzhou. In addition, fish and shrimp are the main dishes. However, in this arid time, the production of fish and shrimp is particularly low, and prices have naturally soared, becoming twice as expensive as usual.</p>
<h3>Snacks</h3>
<p>These are not just idle snacks like melon seeds, but also seasonal foods for summer, such as mung bean soup, lily soup, broad bean cake, and mung bean jelly. Although these snacks are all sold in the market, they inevitably involve raw water, which is not hygienic, so it is best to make them yourself. To make mung bean soup and lily soup, simply wash the mung beans and lilies, tear the lilies apart, remove the tips, and boil them on a charcoal or kerosene stove. To make broad bean cake, boil the broad beans until soft, remove the skins, drain, and make a cake. To make mung bean jelly, boil agar-agar until melted and freeze it in cold water. These snacks should be eaten cold with sugar, which can both satisfy hunger and serve as a cold dish to dispel summer heat.</p>
<h3>Eating Maxims</h3>
<p>"Everyone has the same taste in food." In this scorching sun, where the fields are cracked and the farmers are braving the heat to irrigate, with their hearts like frying oil, Sha Yu leisurely waves his palm-leaf fan and still plans the menu. To be honest, he is indeed becoming a young master who doesn't know the price of rice and firewood. The coolies struggle to make a living, while I talk about chicken and duck, which makes me feel too heartless! However, since Sha Yu cannot go hungry every day, and summer food has a close relationship with life, if people still cherish their lives, summer food must be treated with special caution! Now I will write down a few of my maxims on diet below to conclude this small recipe. (1) Do not eat purchased wine and preserved meat. (2) Do not eat rotten fruit. (3) Do not eat cheap cold drinks. (4) Food should be boiled thoroughly. (5) Food must be covered with gauze. (6) Do not eat sour or rotten food!</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Announces That This Year's Preliminary University Entrance Exam Will Not Be Held</h3>
<p>▲ University Entrance for Graduates of Unregistered Private High Schools</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau announced yesterday: It has been found that students are not allowed to apply to private schools that have not been approved and registered, and junior colleges and above are not allowed to recruit transfer students from unregistered junior colleges and above, or students from unregistered secondary schools. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly issued orders and announcements on file. The bureau's previous handling of supplementary preliminary university entrance exams for graduates of unregistered high schools was approved by order of the Ministry of Education. This semester, the bureau has not received approval from the Ministry of Education, so the bureau will not hold it. However, the local newspapers on the 18th published an article about the bureau's commissioner Zhou Shang's talks on unregistered high school graduates still being able to take the university entrance exam in advance, which is actually a news recording error and should be urgently announced for correction. Please be informed of this notice.</p>
<h3>There Is a Solution to the Certificate Problem for Northeastern Students Applying for Schools and Transfers</h3>
<p>Announcement by the Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office</p>
<p>The Autumn Northeastern Student Exam Will Be Held on August 2nd This Year</p>
<p>(Beiping News) The Ministry of Education's Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office, considering that the Northeastern students newly entering the country hold graduation or academic certificates from fake organizations' high schools, junior high schools, or equivalent schools, and cannot participate in the school application and transfer exams, has drafted a remedial method and submitted it to the Ministry of Education for approval and amendment. The method is roughly as follows: The Ministry of Education's Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office and the Beiping Municipal Social Bureau will hold two exams each year in Beiping for Northeastern students who have graduated or studied at fake organizations' high schools, junior high schools, or equivalent schools (one in spring and one in autumn). Each exam will be held during the general school admission exam period, so that they can be admitted and apply to various schools. All students who have graduated from fake organizations' high schools, junior high schools, or equivalent schools, in addition to Chinese, Party Principles, Civics, History, and Geography as required subjects, will also be tested on the important subjects they studied in their third academic year. Students who have studied will also be tested on the important subjects they studied in their last year of study. Students who pass the exam will be issued a school application certificate by the office, so that they can hold the certificate to apply to various schools or request admission to the corresponding grade in various schools. If the high school and junior high school graduates who fail the exam are from Northeastern provinces, they can apply to the National Northeastern Zhongshan High School High School and Junior High School Remedial Classes or other remedial schools. After completing the remedial period, they can participate in the office's exam again. Whether the students have graduated or studied for several semesters in Northeastern schools, in addition to submitting verification documents, they should obtain proof from two or more Northeastern people. The certifying person is limited to those who currently have a corresponding occupation in the country. The aforementioned exams will be handled by a committee jointly formed by the office and the bureau. After the Education Relief Office received the order, in order to allow the students to urgently apply for schools, it drafted the autumn exam for this year. From now on, the registration office in Beiping (Beiping Xuan Nei City Party Department Street) will accept registrations until July 30th. The exam will begin on August 2nd, it is said.</p>
<h3>Government-Funded Students Receive Fees in Two Installments</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 27th) According to the Ministry of Education's regulations on the method of receiving fees for government-funded students from various provinces this time, after the certificates are issued, the fees to be received will be disbursed in two installments uniformly by each province.

<h3>The Children's Welfare Society and Other Organizations Are Actively Preparing for Children's Libraries</h3>
<p>▲ The First Library Will Be Established in He'an Next Month</p>
<p>▲ Bookstores Universally Donate Children's Books</p>
<p>The Municipal Children's Welfare Committee and the Children's Morning News are jointly preparing to establish children's libraries to enhance children's knowledge and facilitate children's reading. They are now actively preparing, and the first library may be established in mid-August. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The First Library Will Be Established</h3>
<p>The society's children's libraries,</p>
<p>The first step of the plan is to establish one each in Zhabei and Nanshi. The various rules and regulations have been formulated, and Zhao Zengqi has been appointed as the director of the first library, and Qian Fugong as the director of the second library. The first library's location has been decided to be inside the He'an Elementary School in Zhabei. It is currently being arranged and may be established in mid-August. The second library was originally scheduled to be located inside the Shangwen Elementary School in Nanshi, but because the school has no spare rooms, the location has not yet been determined, and may be renting a house.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Solicit Books</h3>
<p>Since the library solicited books from all parties,</p>
<p>There have been many donors. All children's books in bookstores have been universally donated. The library continues to solicit various children's books. All bookstores, school organizations, groups, and individuals are welcome. In the future, the names of the donors will be noted under the title of the library's book catalog and book cards, and donors will be given corresponding souvenirs.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Hold Preparatory Meetings to Send Off Students Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>▲ 5 PM on the Afternoon of the 30th at the New Asia Restaurant</p>
<p>The Global Chinese Student Association and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau are launching a farewell meeting for students studying abroad, which will be held in mid-August. Details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that more than twenty organizations have participated, such as Shen Bao, Xin Wen Bao, Chen Bao, Da Lu Bao, Shen Shi Telegraph Agency, Shi Shi Xin Bao, Da Wan Bao, Zhong Hua Ri Bao, Min Bao, China Critic Weekly, Shanghai News Agency, Shanghai Municipal Local Association, Shanghai Municipal Education Association, Chinese Vocational Education Society, Qinghua Alumni Association, International Relations Research Association, British Alumni Association, Sino-French Friendship Association, International Society, National Jiaotong University, which have joined the initiative. A preparatory meeting is scheduled to be held at 5 PM on the afternoon of July 30th at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road to discuss all the proceedings. It is said that Mayor Wu has expressed great support for this initiative.</p>
<h3>The Results of the Third Municipal Elementary School Teacher Certification Have Been Announced</h3>
<p>Previous Certificates Can Be Retrieved by Holding Receipts</p>
<p>If Participating in Registration, the Receipt for the Previous Certificates Paid Can Be Submitted</p>
<p>The third municipal elementary school teacher certification organized by the Municipal Education Bureau has been fully approved and the results have been announced yesterday. In addition to those who do not meet the qualifications, fail the exam, and lack documentary evidence, six lists of names including non-examination certification and examination certification have been published in the bureau's announcement in the Chen Bao. The previously submitted documentary evidence can be retrieved from the bureau with the original receipt starting today. If you need to participate in the bureau's eighth registration, you can submit the receipt for the certificates submitted during the certification along with the registration form to the bureau to avoid returning them and resubmitting the documents. The certification certificates are being filled out by the bureau and will be distributed soon. It is said that there were more than 1,300 applicants for this certification. It happened to be during the middle school graduation joint examination, and the bureau affairs were busy and urgent, and the review had to be careful, so the announcement was later than usual.</p>
<h3>Pudong Middle School Is Preparing to Build a New School Building</h3>
<p>Pudong Middle School in this city was founded by Yang Sisheng and will be thirty years old soon. The school buildings are dilapidated and mostly damaged. In addition, the number of students has increased sharply, which is not enough to apply. Now, when Principal Lin Zhongke is in office, he immediately takes the reconstruction of the school buildings as a matter of urgency. It cannot be realized due to economic relations. Recently, it was heard that Principal Lin consulted with Chairman of the Board of Directors Du Yuesheng, Zhang Jiguang, Zhang Xiaoliang and other gentlemen and agreed to expand the school site and add new houses, and repair the old school buildings. Yesterday, Wang Xinxing Shunji Construction Factory came to the school to survey and plan. It is said that it will be divided into two steps: repairing and building before and after.</p>
<h3>Recent News from New Asia Middle School</h3>
<p>Since the New Asia Elementary and Middle School on Hengbang Bridge, North Sichuan Road, has been commended and approved for registration by the Municipal Education Bureau, the school's responsible personnel are more enthusiastic. The teachers hired are all highly qualified and experienced. The content is prepared and a large number of additions have been made. Currently, during the summer vacation, the entire school building will be greatly renovated, and the atmosphere will be renewed. Director Pan Gongzhan personally inscribed the school plaque, which is grand and magnificent. Recently, due to the enthusiastic requests from all parties and the large number of male and female students who came to register, the original number of students may not be able to accommodate them. The school affairs meeting has decided to open classes with different tracks for each grade. In addition, because the space reserved for students is very crowded, it has been decided to build a dormitory. The survey has been completed and submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works for approval.</p>
<h3>Qingguang Elementary School Is Making Efforts to Progress</h3>
<p>Qingguang Elementary School in West Shanghai has complete facilities and strict teaching management. In recent months, the work of preparing to build a school building has been even more tense. Principal Song Jianqing is enthusiastic about school affairs. Starting next semester, communication slips between parents and the school will be used to connect parents and make teaching management more convenient. In addition, the production achievements of the labor course are planned by Zhao Youliang, a member of the school's board of directors. Zhao has served in municipal primary and secondary schools for many years and is a senior in the art world. In the future, the production achievements of the school's labor course will be considerable.</p>
<h3>Minzhi Junior High School Revises Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>Minzhi Junior High School in Xinjiag Huayuan West, Xinzha Road, considering the bankruptcy of rural areas and the social recession, the heavy burden on parents, and the difficulty for children to study, has decided to separate boarding and commuting, and revise the tuition fees accordingly. 1. Boarding fees for male and female boarding students are completely waived. 2. Commuting students with two or more siblings studying together will have their tuition fees reduced by five yuan each, in order to fulfill the aspirations of young people to study and reduce the burden on parents. In addition, the Chinese Education Office subsidizes ten students in the first and second grades with half the tuition fee, which is a small compensation for poor children who are eager to study. It is said that the school will recruit new students on the morning of the 30th of this month, and registration will close on the afternoon of the 29th.</p>
<h3>Sports News</h3>
<p>Grand Opening of the Gan Swimming Pool and Water Sports Meet</p>
<p>▲ Yang Xiuqiong and Her Family Will Perform Wonderfully and Leave Ganzhou Today for Beijing and Shanghai</p>
<p>▲ Nanchang Is Determined to Promote Sports</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) Chairman Chiang's New Life Movement for National Rejuvenation,</p>
<p>Sports is one of its important factors. Nanchang, the center of the new Lianhe province, under the constant instructions of Chiang, health regulations and other items are making rapid progress. Especially sports, which is related to health, is being vigorously promoted by the authorities. Various physical exercises, such as horsemanship, martial arts, and water sports, have emerged like mushrooms after rain. However, water sports not only lack equipment in Jiangxi, but also in the whole country. Therefore, the New Life Club has decided to build a permanent foundation.</p>
<p>▲ Gentlemen and Ladies All Like to Learn to Swim</p>
<p>Especially in the Ganjiang Dongbianguan Yishuilian Pool under the horsemanship movement field in the North Park of Dewai City, the scale is slightly complete. Every day, when the sun sets on the west mountain, the evening glow reddens the heart of the waves, and fashionable men and women, looking up and down, are like ducks warming in the spring river. It can be seen that those above have a good example, and those below will definitely follow it.</p>
<p>▲ 30,000 Yuan to Build Two Swimming Pools</p>
<p>In order to improve the equipment, the pool has decided to build on a large scale with 30,000 yuan, and has sent people to other swimming pools to learn from them. At the same time, in order to awaken social attention to the water movement, it has launched a water sports meeting, and invited Miss China Yang Xiuqiong, who has been honored in the Far East, to Ganzhou to perform and inspire the interest of all walks of life in swimming. The venue is built on the east bank of the Ganjiang River, divided into two swimming areas for senior and junior levels, with the park behind it and the West Mountain facing it, making it a pleasant place to swim. The command station is built on the river bank, with a record coming, and below are the ordinary spectator seats. There are starting points and end points for diving in the field. There are dressing rooms and lounges for men and women on the shore, and the layout is well organized. Chiang Kai-shek is the honorary chairman of the conference, and Xiong Shi is the chairman. Chen Qingyun, a member of the Central Committee, is in charge because he is still in Lushan and will return soon. Registrants are very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>▲ Opening Ceremony Under the Scorching Sun</p>
<p>The New Life Club's newly built swimming pool held its opening ceremony on the 25th, and at the same time opened the first water sports meet. Under the scorching sun at noon, even though sweat was constantly flowing, people who watched the water sports meet, one after another, went along Yuanchuqiu Street to the swimming pool of the iron factory. The rickshaw was slower than the pedestrians, and the car was even more difficult to walk than the rickshaw. The congestion can be imagined. Stepping into the gate of the venue, one glance at the area near the river was a sea of people. The command station, the press stand, and the press stand were all overcrowded. The estimated number of people was around seven or eight thousand. Those who crossed the river by boat or wading and saved the four yuan ticket fee were not included. Because the water movement in Ganzhou is the first time, it cannot be compared with the common land sports, and there is also the first glimpse of the mermaid, so it can arouse a group of people's enthusiasm and not be afraid of the heat. The meeting was delayed until 2 pm due to the military band's slow arrival.</p>
<h3>A Panoramic View of the Nanchang Swimming Pool) Sent by Guo Zhenqiu (</h3>
<p>▲Chairman Chen Yun's Opening Speech</p>
<p>Because there were too many people on the platform and fearing danger, the presidium temporarily chose to hold the ceremony on the beach. Chairman Chen Yun of the Central Committee gave a speech after the ceremony, briefly stating that promoting sports in the New Life Movement is a dual approach to strengthening the body and revitalizing the nation. Swimming is a good exercise to strengthen the body. He hoped everyone would strive forward with a spirit of self-improvement. Subsequently, Director He of the Military Affairs Department gave a speech, stating that sports can cure China's weakness, and Director Chen of the Education Department gave a speech, stating that people should know four kinds of sports: (1) walking, (2) running, (3) jumping, and (4) swimming. Compared with other countries, the physical fitness of Chinese people is truly shameful, especially women. Women in Jiangxi were unable to score any points in sports in the past, but this year, it is hoped that everyone will learn from Miss Yang and strive for self-improvement to wipe out the shame.</p>
<p>▲Yang Xiuqiong's Speech and Ribbon-Cutting</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong gave a speech, expressing her desire to bring the New Life Movement back to the South. After saying many words, Yang Xiuqiong, wearing a light red cheongsam, cut the ribbon to the accompaniment of foreign music, ascending the podium step by step. At that time, there were no fewer than seventy or eighty action cameras and handheld cameras on the scene, taking pictures like guns and cannons aimed at the flag amidst the music. After the ceremony, the competition began. The details of the competition and performances are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>▲Good Results in Men's and Women's Preliminary Rounds</p>
<p>The first scene of the preliminary round was the men's and women's 50-meter freestyle. In the three groups, He Buliang achieved a time of 34.6 seconds, equaling the Chinese record. In the men's 200-meter breaststroke, the best time was Huang Wenyu's 4 minutes and 35 seconds, which was much slower than the Chinese record of 100 meters. In the men's 100-meter freestyle, Wan Ronggui's time was 1 minute and 37.6 seconds, almost equaling the Chinese record of 400 meters. Fu Xiuxiang's time in the women's 400-meter freestyle was 8 minutes and 35 seconds, which was very poor. The women's 25-meter freestyle was also the focus of attention, because in past sports meets, although there was a women's swimming event, no one dared to go into the water. Although only five people participated this time, it can be considered the first time that women have publicly shown their skills in the swimming pool. The first place was Zhou Muliang, with a time of 28.8 seconds. Overall, it is better than nothing and can be considered a noteworthy event.</p>
<p>▲Performance by the Yang Family Father, Son, and Daughters</p>
<p>The most noteworthy performance was by the Yang family father, son, and daughters. When the loudspeaker on the podium announced the performance by the Yang sisters, the heads of the spectators in the water rippled like waves stirred by the wind. Xiuqiong and Xiuqiong were both wearing swimming suits with the words "Hong Kong" of the Far Eastern Expedition. After the two entered the water, they first performed the American-style breaststroke. The sister flowers transformed into flatfish, moving forward and backward in perfect unison. It was difficult for the audience to distinguish who was the older sister and who was the younger sister. However, when turning around, Xiuqiong's agility naturally surpassed her sister. Next was the frog-style breaststroke, with the two sisters breaking through the waves side by side. Although the speed was fast, the waves were not large. Their movements were as natural as fish swimming freely, without any effort, demonstrating a high level of skill. When turning around, Xiuqiong turned too vigorously and rushed out of bounds. Xiuqiong was one or two feet ahead of her younger sister, and Xiuqiong suddenly exerted her strength, finally achieving parity far from the finish line, which was also a flaw. Afterwards, Xiuqiong performed the frog-style backstroke, floating lightly on the water as if she was in her element. Twenty-five meters was not enough to show her length.</p>
<p>▲Yang Changhua Beats His Father</p>
<p>After the sisters' performance, the father and son followed with a backstroke demonstration. Xiuqiong's younger brother, Changhua, who was thirteen years old, and his father, Zhunan, both moved forward with the backstroke, looking like they were driving in reverse. Changhua, with his light body and lively nature, finally surpassed his father at the end, causing the audience to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>▲Coach Swims with Hands and Feet Tied</p>
<p>Outside the Yang family, the most impressive performance was by the swimming pool coach, Yang Yuanhua. After two people bound his hands and feet, he was pushed into the water. He flipped over and over, stretching and contracting like a looper caterpillar, covering fifty meters in an instant, stunning the audience.</p>
<p>▲Diving by the Lushan Swimming Team</p>
<p>In addition, Ouyang Xu and others from the Lushan Swimming Team performed various fancy dives from a 15-meter-high platform, either swooping down like an eagle or somersaulting like a pigeon, which was also quite spectacular. There was also the two-person leg swimming, where two people formed a group, each with one leg tied together, with three groups competing, walking in a disheveled manner, bringing laughter to the water scene. Yuan of Lianhua took footage of it to be shown in theaters.</p>

<p>▲Military Officers' Swimming is Also Enjoyable</p>
<p>The conference lasted for three days. After the final events were completed, the Yang family crossed the Gan River, performing their signature moves. The Political Training Department of the Military Headquarters, in order to expand sports publicity, had film director Yin Luojing and others report that the Lushan Army Officer Training Corps had also opened a swimming pool for general practice and had invited Yang to perform in Lushan. After performing here, Yang will go to Beijing at the invitation of Chu Minyi to perform. Although Beijing has already sent a telegram requesting her presence, it is still uncertain whether Yang will go. (July 25th)</p>
<p>▲The Conference Closed Yesterday, Yang Leaves Jiangxi</p>
<p>Telegrams from Beijing and Shanghai Urge Her to Go East</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanchang, 27th) The conference closed today. Yang Xiuqiong received a telegram from Chu Minyi urging her to participate in the Capital Swimming Competition on schedule, and also received a telegram from the Shanghai Youth Association inviting her to perform swimming techniques in Shanghai. Yang is scheduled to leave the province on the morning of the 28th.</p>

<h3>Shanghai International Swimming Competition, Chinese Preliminary Rounds Today</h3>
<p>▲Starting at 8 PM at the YMCA</p>
<p>Preparations for the Chinese team to participate in the Shanghai International Swimming Competition preliminary rounds concluded yesterday afternoon with the registration deadline. A total of 27 people joined. The preliminary rounds are scheduled to be held tonight at 8 PM at the YMCA swimming pool on Sichuan Road. Wen Jingling and Zhu Pei for short distances, Li Rixin for breaststroke, Zhou Dayun and Zhang Renheng for long distances, and Xia Zeren and Hu Qijie for fancy diving are all outstanding talents of the time. Competition at the time is expected to be promising. However, there are fewer talents in the backstroke category. Since Yang Yuanhua went to Beijing and Yu Binqi retired, it is a pity that no one is close to the national record. I hope those who participate in this event will work hard.</p>

<h3>Phenomena of Ultra-Short Waves and Short Waves in the Universe</h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>We know that using short waves to reach long distances relies entirely on sky waves. Originally, there is a layer of ionized gas surrounding the Earth's surface about eighty or ninety miles away, called the Heaviside layer. This Heaviside layer seems to reflect light like a mirror. Radio waves below a certain wavelength are reflected when they encounter it, so shortwave communication can reach farther distances. Radio waves from several thousand meters to five or six meters are reflected by the Heaviside layer. However, radio waves below five meters in wavelength do not have this effect. From five meters down, as the wavelength gradually decreases, the influence of the Heaviside layer also gradually decreases; when it decreases to below two meters, called ultra-short waves, the Heaviside layer completely loses its function. At this time, the Heaviside layer does not have a reflective effect on radio waves below two meters like a mirror, but becomes a piece of glass without mercury. Radio waves pass straight through after a slight refraction. Therefore, when we use ultra-shortwave communication, the transmitting and receiving machines must be on the same horizontal plane or the two machines must be able to see each other. However, in experiments, Marconi achieved a maximum distance of one hundred and thirty-seven miles using ultra-short waves. Such a large distance, because of the curvature of the ground, cannot be on the same horizontal plane. So what is the reason that communication is still possible? There is still no full explanation. But Marconi has at least confirmed that most of the radio waves have passed through the Heaviside layer and disappeared into the universe, and what is received is only a small part of it. A recent analogy of this fact is that radio waves can be refracted in the air, just like after the sun has just set below the horizon, its light is refracted by the atmosphere, and we can still see the afterglow. As for where most of the radio waves that pass through the Heaviside layer and disappear into the universe go, no one has yet been able to explain. The speed of ultra-shortwave propagation is the same as that of light, 286,000 miles per second. Then these disappeared radio waves can reach the moon in one and a quarter seconds. If ultra-short waves are transmitted to Venus, it will only take two and a third minutes to reach it, but of course, transmitting such a long distance requires considerable power.</p>
<p>We still don't fully understand the characteristics of ultra-short waves in the universe, but a few years ago, scientists discovered that shortwave transmissions have the same "echo" phenomenon. After the signal is sent out by the transmitter, it returns after a few seconds, just like the echo we hear when we speak in a valley. Scientists hypothesize that this is due to the existence of another ionized layer outside the Earth's atmosphere or simply beyond the Moon's orbit, but this is just a hypothesis. Because millions of miles away from the Earth's center is a complete vacuum. However, the fact that the signal returns proves that there is at least a shell-like layer that interacts with electromagnetic waves at that distant distance. This shell-like layer that reflects ultra-short waves may be caused by solar magnetism and Earth's magnetism. At least its existence can be confirmed by the "echo" of the above-mentioned signals.</p>
<p>Many scientists feel that the above theory is not practical, so they created the "Dust Particle Theory." The main idea of this theory is that countless meteorites are produced in the universe every day. Among them, countless meteorites smaller than dust, visible only under a microscope, attack the Earth every day. At the same time, due to the Earth's gravity and the Sun's gravity, these meteorites smaller than dust can only stay in places where the two forces are equal, forming a shell-like layer to reflect ultra-short waves.</p>
<p>Of the above two theories, the latter is more detailed. In short, the research of ultra-short waves, from the perspective of the future of astronomical experiments, the future traffic from Earth to the Moon or even from Earth to the planets by rockets must rely on ultra-short waves. Although this is a problem that cannot be realized for the time being, judging from the current trend, we can be sure that the realization of this ideal is possible.</p>
<h3>Shortwave Range Table</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>The range of shortwave communication varies greatly depending on the wavelength, season, day, and night. The table below was compiled by RCA Victor Co. based on its years of records on this issue, detailing the range of shortwave communication with various wavelengths in different seasons and times. It is a very valuable reference for both shortwave transmitting and receiving parties.</p>
<p>Because shortwave communication is divided into sky waves and ground waves after being emitted from the transmitter; sky waves travel in the atmosphere, and ground waves travel along the Earth's surface: the range they can receive is different, so "8" in the table means "range is infinite", and "X" means "cannot be received under normal circumstances".</p>
<h3>An Economical and Effective Three-Tube Shortwave Radio</h3>
<p>— Bing Yi</p>
<p>An ideal shortwave radio for amateur researchers should be easy to adjust, avoid complex circuits; be economical in electricity, avoid excessive costs; use DC power to avoid unwanted AC hum when receiving very high frequencies; and especially be effective, so as not to be discouraged by initial failures.</p>
<p>The author recently assembled a DC economical three-tube shortwave radio, and the reception results are very satisfactory, much better than what was made before. Now I will write it down below for the reference of amateur comrades who are just beginning to study shortwaves.</p>
<p>In addition to being economical and easy to manufacture, this radio has the advantages of: stable oscillation; few noise points; easy adjustment; wide distribution; is what makes me most satisfied.</p>
<p>The circuit of the whole radio is shown in Figure 1. The component values are as follows:</p>
<p>V1 V2 RCA N0.34 V3 RCA N0.30</p>
<p>C1 C2 25NNF C3 140NMF</p>
<p>C4 100MMF C5 C6 0201MFD</p>
<p>C7 IMFDC8 0.006MFD</p>
<p>R1 12 ohms R2 5MEG ohms</p>
<p>R3 IMEG ohms</p>
<p>AFC uses a low-frequency transformer with the primary and secondary windings connected in series, or a 30 Henry low-frequency choke coil.</p>
<p>RFC Three shortwave high-frequency choke coils are used, with very small stray capacitance. Made by yourself on a radius wooden stick, make three slots 2/8 inches long, and wind them in order with N0.38 double-silk-covered wire. RFC2 and RFC3 can also be used on a half-inch diameter paper tube) soak in wax (use 38 wire to wind 2 inches long for application.</p>
<p>The panel uses a 1/16-inch thick, 62/1-inch wide, 102/1-inch long aluminum plate. Open three holes on the front, install a micro-motion dial for tuning adjustment in the center, a regeneration control knob on the left, and a filament resistance knob on the right. The bottom plate uses a 102/1-inch long, 7-inch wide wax-soaked wooden bottom plate.</p>
<p>The power connector does not use wiring posts, but a five-pin tube socket and a five-pin plug.</p>
<p>The coil uses five five-pin plug-in types, and the winding method is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>The number of coil turns is as follows:</p>
<p>Frequency Band L1 L2 L3</p>
<p>1750K C 30 70 18</p>
<p>3500K C 20 40 12</p>
<p>7000K C 9 17 6</p>
<p>14000K C 5 6 4</p>
<p>28000K C 3 3 3</p>
<p>The number of feedback coil turns is often uncertain. During the test, first connect the grid voltage of V2 to 221/2V, turn C3 to 3/4, and rotate C2 to make each part oscillate. All five coils must be tested, especially at 14000KC and 28000KC, because it is more difficult and requires careful verification.</p>
<p>Among the five coils, the one that receives the 1750KC band uses 32 single-strand silk-covered wire. The others use 28 strand silk-covered wire. L1 L2 L3 are 8/1 inch apart in order. Wind without any gaps.</p>
<p>The antenna should be high rather than long, and the connection wire should be about fifty feet long. If you use a short antenna or an indoor antenna, C can be short-circuited. The author has tested it connected to a 120-foot Hertz antenna) and found that the effect is better and there is no noise.</p>
<p>Also, when winding the coil, you can first heat the yarn and wind it while it is hot. It will be firm after it is cool. After the coil is calibrated, you can apply fast-drying magnetic paint, and avoid using resin glue and the like.</p>
<h3>An Affordable Shortwave Radio</h3>
<p>— Pan Renrong</p>
<p>Judging from the general trend, this year seems to be the year of shortwave radio. So, it is very interesting to assemble an affordable shortwave radio at this time. This radio meets the requirements of being economical and simple. If assembled well, it can receive radio stations from Moscow, Khabarovsk, and the United Kingdom. The wavelength is from 18 to 190 meters. If you want to receive the broadcast band (280-550M), you must prepare another one or two plug-in coils.</p>
<p>Please refer to the attached diagram for all parts of the radio. Because the human body is more sensitive to shortwave radio, it is best to install it in a metal case such as an aluminum plate. The size of the panel is 51/2X7, and the bottom plate is 91/2X9. The grid circuit and feedback circuit of each wavelength band are all wound on a 2-inch diameter insulated electric tube, with a distance of about one-eighth of an inch apart. The number of feedback coil turns can have some variations. When testing for the first time, please connect a 22.5 volt B battery to just get the oscillation. After winding, install them firmly on the tube socket. There are also special ones for this purpose on the market that can be purchased, but this method is more economical. A total of five copies. When receiving a certain wavelength band, insert the corresponding coil and adjust the resistance R2 to increase or decrease the B voltage of the detector tube. This is what controls the feedback. It is more stable than using an adjustable version to replace it, but is ultimately inferior to the previous method in terms of stability. The tuning capacitor C3 is about 100MMfd, the smaller its capacity, the less likely it is to miss radio stations. It is also necessary to prepare a micro-motion dial. The coil design is as follows.</p>
<p>Wavelength (meters) (Grid circuit) (For feedback)</p>
<p>(1) 18-28M 4 turns 6 turns 22 D.S.C.</p>
<p>(2) 28-50M 8: 6: : :</p>
<p>(3) 42-70M 12: 8: : :</p>
<p>(4) 60-100M 18: 8: : :</p>
<p>(5) 100-190M 45: 12: : :</p>
<p>The antenna circuit's capacitor can be fixed or variable. The variable one can use a small three- or five-plate capacitor. For fixed, two pieces of 1X11/2" copper foil can be folded at right angles, with the two vertical surfaces facing each other about one-sixteenth of an inch apart. Vacuum tubes 30, 01, 99, 109, etc. are all good. If you need to add more power to the last stage, please add an additional B battery to the X. The antenna does not need to be too long. It is good to have C1 to adjust. My friend Mr. Gao used a four-foot-long indoor tail antenna to receive Khabarovsk very loudly. The values of each part are noted below.</p>
<p>C1 100MMFD R 2MG</p>
<p>C2 115" R1 12030G</p>
<p>C3 2100"</p>
<p>C4 3250" R2 250000 variable resistor</p>

<p>(2) Poor selectivity when matching coils for shortwaves is due to the stray capacitance of the matching coils, accounting for 70%. The stray capacitance of the coil is related to the shape, number of turns, and thickness of the wire. The coil wound on a spider web board has a large stray capacitance. The cylinder has a smaller stray capacitance. Coils wound closely have the largest stray capacitance, followed by flat-wound coils; spaced-wound coils have the smallest. Also, for cylindrical coils, a small diameter results in a small stray capacitance, and vice versa. Therefore, the diameter should be below two and a half inches, but not less than one inch. Furthermore, the length of the coil and its diameter should be in a ratio, resulting in the smallest stray capacitance, and the magnetic field is also small, making it less susceptible to external interference. It is more appropriate to use 24 to 30 gauge double-strand or double-silk-covered wire. )</p>
<p>(3) Other various components. All branch capacitors and choke coils are used for filtering; indirectly, they are connected in series or parallel with the tuning circuit. Within the possible range, the larger the capacitance, the better. Because the larger the capacitance, the smaller the impact. Branch capacitors should use about 0.1 microfarads, and choke coils should be about eight millihenries, and all must be of high quality.</p>
<p>C Conclusion</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the relationship between tuning frequency is not a simple one such as</p>
<p>but is</p>
<p>Based on this, I made a radio according to the second circuit, and the selectivity is not inferior to that of a superheterodyne radio. C2 uses a 300 picofarad straight-line capacitance type. C1 uses 50 picofarads. The only difference is the design of the coil.</p>
<p>The coil is made of a wooden cylinder with a diameter of two inches carved with many empty slots. First, wind 25 turns using a spaced-winding method, and extract a lead here; from 25 turns to 50 turns, use a flat-winding method, with a tap every five turns. From 50 turns to 80 turns, use a flat-winding method, with a tap every ten turns. The coil is a total of two inches long, wound with American standard 26 gauge double-strand silk-covered wire. Coat with cotton glue. The wavelength range is from 180 meters to 600 meters.</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications reorganized the broadcasting stations, the minimum frequency difference is 20 KHz. If the radio circuit and manufacturing can be improved, without adhering to European and American precedents, even a simple circuit can give us satisfactory results; amateur researchers should pay attention to it!</p>

<h3>Bitter Crossing</h3>
<p>— Ji Qun</p>
<p>In my heart, I had long heard of a pristine and tranquil island. So, as soon as I finished breakfast, I gathered a few friends and went to the coast to hire a boat, planning to take a trip there.</p>
<p>When we boarded the boat, the sky was covered with huge black clouds, as if it wanted to rain. However, the rain that wanted to fall had not yet come down, and we had been wanting to visit that island for too long. So, after settling down on the boat, we disregarded everything and immediately waved to the boatman to cast off.</p>
<p>The boat sailed for a whole hour, the wind was calm and the waves were still, and it was quite peaceful. But after sailing for another half hour or so, things changed. The rain started to fall from the sky, and then the wind became fierce, and then the rain became heavy, and then the waves became turbulent, and then we were in extreme danger.</p>
<p>As we were in that dangerous situation, some of our friends, frightened by the raging waves, had the idea of turning the boat back. At that time, I asked the boatman how far we were from the island. The boatman said, "Soon, just an arrow's shot away." When I heard this, I immediately said to my friends, "We are already in danger, and turning back would still be dangerous. We are not far from the island, so we might as well push forward through the waves." These few words of mine actually dispelled their fear and roused their courage again, and they continued to fight against the ferocious waves.</p>
<p>We really fought hard against those ferocious waves for a long time. Later, the wind stopped, the rain ceased, and the sun crawled out from between the clouds. Even the ferocious waves seemed to be subdued by our indomitable spirit, and they calmed down temporarily. And our boat, at this time, was spat out of danger and reached our destination.</p>
<p>"Friends, look! What a pristine paradise this is!"</p>
<p>"Yes, this is a paradise that we could only obtain through a bitter crossing."</p>
<p>In an instant, the pristine and tranquil island was filled with such joyous shouts.</p>

<h3>On Literary Catharsis (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>Third is Cold Humor: Regarding the method of catharsis through cold humor, we only need to cite a few examples of people who have been catharted.</p>
<p>(1) The Story of Wei Zheng: When Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty's empress died, he was extremely sad, wasting money and extravagant funerals, the size of the mausoleum was unprecedented. One day, Taizong invited Wei Zheng to climb a tower together to look at Zhaoling (i.e., the mausoleum of Taizong's empress). Taizong pointed at Zhaoling and showed it to him. Wei Zheng pretended not to see it and said, "This old minister's eyes are blurred, I can't see it!" Taizong said, "Look! Isn't that it?"</p>
<p>"Is that Zhaoling?" Wei Zheng asked again.</p>
<p>"Yes!" Taizong replied proudly.</p>
<p>"This old minister thought that Your Majesty was looking at Xianling here! (Xianling is the mausoleum of Taizong's father and mother, which had already been destroyed and not repaired at this time.) As for Zhaoling, this old minister has long since ceased to see it!" Wei Zheng replied with these two sentences lightly, unexpectedly causing Taizong to feel ashamed and immediately destroy the tower overlooking Zhaoling and go to repair Xianling.</p>
<p>Wei Zheng was able to speak with cold humor, deeply catharting a breath of indignation for the Gaozu emperor in the afterlife.</p>
<p>(2) (The Story of Dongfang Shuo: The wet nurse of Emperor Wu of Han offended him and should have been punished with banishment. The wet nurse asked Dongfang Shuo for help. Shuo said, "This cannot be disputed with words, but there is a method. Tomorrow, in front of the emperor, when the law enforcer receives the emperor's order to pull you away, you must look back again and again, staring intently at the emperor's face, without saying a word. Then I will have an idea." The next day, Emperor Wu interrogated the wet nurse, and Dongfang Shuo was also at the side. As the wet nurse was about to leave, she followed Dongfang Shuo's words and stared straight at Emperor Wu without blinking. Dongfang Shuo said coldly and humorously, "You stupid fellow! Why don't you leave quickly? Does the emperor still remember your old kindness when you breastfed him?" With this reminder, Emperor Wu immediately moved with old feelings and rescinded the order to banish the wet nurse.</p>
<p>Dongfang Shuo was able to speak with cold humor, catharting a breath of indignation for the wet nurse who had not committed a major crime but was being punished with banishment. (This story is based on the Book of Han, but the Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies of Jesters says that it is the story of Guo Sheren.)</p>
<p>As for the Records of the Grand Historian also has the story of Yu Meng, "like deer bumping into enemies", "the painted city is vast and enemies cannot climb over it", etc. cold and humorous words, which made Qin Shi Huang also repent and vented two breaths of indignation for the common people who were worried about expenses at that time! These examples show a glimpse of the ingenuity of the method. If we were to list and narrate them one by one, it would inevitably be too tedious.</p>
<p>Fourth is indignation. This type of catharsis is especially prevalent in the literary world. When one is stimulated, one becomes indignant and writes poems and novels to vent one's anger. From Qu Yuan's writing of Lisao to Dante's writing of Divine Comedy, for thousands of years, countless works have emerged, all because of an unjust feeling of suffocation that is causing trouble, and ultimately able to produce strange and wonderful so-called brilliance in the literary world. Some are expressed for oneself, some are expressed to save the world.</p>
<p>"It is over! The country has no one! No one knows me, and since no one is worthy of making good government with me, I will follow where Peng Xian dwells." This is expressed for oneself and for the world. "Behind the vermilion gates, wine and meat stink, on the road there are frozen bones," and "A cluster of dark-colored flowers, the tax on ten middle-class families," are famous lines that vent anger for the world. Today, people call it social literature, but the original intention of those who do it is not like that, but only because things cannot be level, so they cry out. Zhang Ji's Song of the Old Farmer says:</p>
<p>"The old farmer's family is poor and lives in the mountains, cultivating three or four acres of mountain land. The seedlings are sparse, and the taxes are heavy, so they cannot eat, and what they pay into the official granary turns into dust. At the end of the year, the hoe and plow are next to the empty room, calling the children to climb the mountain to gather acorns. The merchants from the West River have hundreds of thousands of bushels of pearls, and the dogs in their boats always eat meat."</p>
<p>In today's world, where the countryside is increasingly declining and the power of merchants and compradores is even greater, we feel even more suffocated. However, the environment often makes you keep the hidden pain in your heart without being able to vent it!</p>
<p>The above four methods of catharsis have all been written about. So I read the Analects (the Analects of the past, not the Analects of today), and from the Analects I found a passage that can combine the four wonderful aspects of "satire," "implication," "cold humor," and "indignation":</p>
<p>Chang Ju and Jie Ni were plowing together. Confucius passed by them and sent Zilu to ask for the ford. Chang Ju said, "Who is that holding the reins?" Zilu said: "It is Confucius." He said: "Is it Confucius of Lu?" Zilu said, "It is." He said, "He knows the ford!"</p>
<p>Here, the four characters "He knows the ford!" are both using the ford as a "metaphor" to "satirize," and "implying" endlessly: they are both "coldly humorous" and "indignant" on many levels. These few words alone can combine the four beauties I mentioned in my article. This is why the Analects is the ultimate text. The person who named his book after the Analects really has a lot of intelligence. As for hearing that the new Analects is promoting something called humorous literature, unfortunately I don't understand what is called "humor" at all!</p>
<p>The article on "Methods of Catharsis" has now been written. A guest came, saw it, changed his expression, and asked, "Your methods of catharsis only have four categories, which is not right. You should add a category of 'laughing and cursing,' and include the so-called 'cursing the death god faction' and the 'humorous faction' in this one category. The fact that 'Wang Si scolds everyone and no one hates him' certainly has artistic value. Su Dongpo 'is happy, angry, and curses all become essays,' how could he not value laughing and cursing! What do you think of adding the category of 'laughing and cursing' as the fifth method of catharsis?" I replied angrily, "Let him laugh and curse, I will write my own articles." The guest left puzzled.</p>
<h3>Sin</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>Is knowledge a sin? Knowledge is not a sin. Is class a sin? Class is not a sin. Is the intellectual class a sin? -- The intellectual class is a sin.</p>
<p>Is lack of knowledge a sin? Lack of knowledge is not a sin. Is class a sin? Class is not a sin. Is a class composed of lack of knowledge a sin? -- A class composed of lack of knowledge is also a sin.</p>
<p>This kind of logic not only makes scholars feel uneasy, but even hooligans feel wronged. The talisman of scholars is knowledge, and the basis of hooligans is class. Knowledge is a weapon, and class is strength. The combination of weapons and strength is precisely the only way to compete for survival.</p>
<p>Looking at the phenomena of nature, sheep have flocks of sheep, and wolves have packs of wolves, which is unity. Wild geese also form flocks, with organization and ranks. Bees and ants are even more autocratic monarchies. There is also a kind of fish that swims tail to tail, hooking one, and dragging a string, which seems to be organized. -- Sin? There is no sin.</p>
<p>But regarding this "special group" of humans, the problem is not simple. If a flock of sheep drives away a horse, it is not a sin; but if one sheep eats another sheep, that is a sin. The human method is to form classes, unite strength, bully the weak, and abuse the few. Even in the current Shanghai society, the really powerful masters are on warships, they are the groups of Westerners, and what about the groups of our countrymen? That is a shrimp group, prepared for dinner sooner or later. And this shrimp group also has to live, so it can only devour the weaker aquatic creatures. -- However, they are all human beings! This is sin.</p>
<p>Why don't people feel it is a sin? Because common sin has become social morality. Wang Mang was called a saint, and Wei Zhongxian had ancestral temples erected everywhere. The scholar-officials of the time were not completely dead, that was the social morality of an era.</p>
<h3>Flattery</h3>
<p>— Wen Gu</p>
<p>Flattery is an important social relationship of mankind today, and it is also a secret of life that one must understand. When we are flattered by someone, we will at least feel mentally happy, which is no worse than the taste of eating iced watermelon on a hot day. Once flattered by many people, it is not difficult to become a hero, leader, politician, or scholar, etc. great figure. The more people who flatter, the higher the status of the person being flattered, the greater the power, so that both fame and wealth are gained, so no one does not welcome being flattered.</p>
<p>But if everyone only wants others to flatter them, and wants to put others under their feet to flatter themselves, wouldn't there be no one in the world to do the flattering? But that's not the case. Many people flatter a person being flattered, and this kind of flattery will never work to flatter people too high. The so-called flattery is to be a tower-like structure, with one layer flattering another, the lower the layer, the larger it must be, so that the spire can stand safely, straight into the clouds. The height of the spire is naturally unattainable by everyone, and even those directly under the spire are very proud of themselves. The higher the spire, the higher the layers rise in order. To climb up, one needs to be flattered, but putting others under one's feet to flatter oneself is not an easy task, so it is better to flatter others. According to the principle of one layer flattering another, on the one hand, one flatters, and on the other hand, one can naturally be flattered. As long as the flattery is firm, one's own status will follow the height of the person being flattered. Flattering and being flattered are opposite in name, but in reality, they go hand in hand and have the same function. The person being flattered rises because of being flattered, and the person flattering also rises by flattering others, so the relationship of flattery can exist in society for a long time and continue to be performed.</p>
<h3>Paris Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Lei Baiwei</p>
<p>—Regarding Ou Jingli—</p>
<p>The version of my novel Ou Jingli, published in Free Talk in mid-May, differs greatly from the original manuscript. For example, the sentence "Ou Jingli moistened his life," published on the 17th, was originally written as "Ou Jingli filled his life," which is consistent with the following sentence "Ou Jingli was his entire life." Please publish this letter as a correction. (The rest omitted) June 19</p>
<h3>Shanghai Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Yang Cunren</p>
<p>—Regarding the Technique of Spreading Fame—</p>
<p>Today, Free Talk published Mr. Dunpang's "Technique of Spreading Fame." The younger brother's scolding in the article is close to damaging reputation. The submitted manuscript "Regarding the Technique of Spreading Fame" is requested to be published as a defense. Thank you very much.) (The rest omitted) July 26</p>
<p>Regarding the Technique of Spreading Fame</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Pang discovered the Technique of Spreading Fame in "Miscellaneous Records of Literary Anecdotes in the Qing Dynasty." After copying and passing it down, he added a lot of citations, on the one hand, talking about others, and on the other hand, talking about himself. The article does have a humorous style, but in essence, it teaches the sharp and vicious litigation canon to scold people. Fortunately, I was elevated and seemingly intended to make me spread my fame very directly. Out of gratitude, I am a little uneasy. According to my open letter to Mr. Lu Xun, the original letter can be checked. It came from sincerity. Although Mr. Lu Xun did not understand me in his reply, public opinion is in people's hearts. Mr. Dun Pang said it was "provocation," which is obviously a deliberate slander. Even if it is said to be "believable when picking it up and becoming writing with a brush," in fact, there is really a suspicion of "provocation." I usually don't read "A Grand View of Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" and don't understand the anecdotes of the literary world in the Qing Dynasty, so I didn't learn from the ancients, but honestly published an article that caused trouble and aroused attacks from the enlightened. Moreover, I am naturally stupid and have no "self-knowledge." I honestly published a letter and didn't know that it was a technique of spreading fame. Moreover, that letter did not ask Mr. Lu Xun to include it in his collection, which was even more unexpected. (The "Cultural Train" has nothing to do with me. The facts are all there. Some people refer to it as my publication, which is inexplicable!) However, if a literary and art writer does not work hard in creation, but specializes in writing miscellaneous articles to scold people to enjoy himself, or asks others to include his name in a collection to spread his fame, this kind of technique of spreading fame is considered by Mr. Dun Pang to be the only way, but in my opinion, it is not worth taking. Even if it spreads fame because of this, "a hundred years later," it will only be a miscellaneous essayist. Being instructed to spread fame, there is a lesson from Confucius that "a gentleman is worried about dying without a name being mentioned in later generations." After taking the lesson, I publish my foolishness like this. I wonder what Mr. Dun Pang thinks?</p>
<h3>I Come From The East (9)</h3>
<p>— Xingye</p>
<p>When we mention the Americas, we often only think of the United States. In fact, in North America, the development and progress of Canada, and the spirit of hard work of its people, are more worthy of our praise and emulation. Seventy years ago, the entire Canada had only three million people. Its land area is roughly equal to China or the United States, and its national population is not even equal to one Shanghai, or half of New York. After decades of hard work, the land has been developed; the forests have been exploited; foreign trade has increased seven or eight times; the total output of wheat has increased sixteen times; and the mineral output is worth 200 million yuan per year. Today, Canada is the world's number one producer of asbestos and nickel. It is the world's second largest gold producer and the third largest silver producer. Canada's population is only one-twelfth of the total population of the United States, and its coal reserves are second only to the United States, ranking second in the world. Because of the development of water conservancy projects and the establishment of irrigation systems, it has become the world's second largest wheat producer, and its wheat exports are the largest in the world. In many commercial ports, you can see huge granaries. The port of Montreal has four large granaries that can store 15 million bushels of wheat. These granaries can release 500,000 bushels of wheat to trains or ships in one hour and transport them out. Now this agricultural country, famous for its forests and wheat, is also rapidly industrializing. However, many factories in Canada are branches set up by large American companies. Therefore, American capital flows freely in the Canadian market.</p>
<p>Economic interdependence has created a subtle political relationship between Canada and the United States. This time, I took the Changxing Company's small steamer and sailed from Seattle to Vancouver in the middle of the night. An hour after arriving at the port, the Canadian customs officer came to see my passport. He asked me how many years I had been in this country. I said, "Only an hour." He asked me in surprise, "Your passport states three years!" I said, "I have been in that country for three years, but I have only been in this country for an hour. Which country are you asking about, that country or this country? Although "this" and "that" are not very different now?" Then the person smiled. From this small matter, it can be seen that Canada becoming the United States is probably not far away. What will happen in the future, but when the American flag will be hung in Canada, is a very interesting question.</p>
<p>According to many people who understand the international situation, once the United States goes to war with Japan, Canada, this child, will definitely throw itself into the arms of its American mother. Because in the event of a US-Japan war, the US military will definitely need to pass through Canada in terms of transportation and flight. If Canada remains neutral, in economic terms, the United States can kill it, and in terms of military power, Canada has no possibility of guarding that 3,000-mile land boundary. Moreover, Canada does not need the United States to invade, and will automatically turn against Japan, because Canada's fear of Japan is even more severe than that of the Americans. If Japan occupies Alaska, or sends planes from the North Pacific to bomb several major cities on the US Pacific coast, Canada will inevitably be sacrificed. Moreover, Canada's undeveloped land will make the Japanese covetous. Therefore, on the day the Second World War begins, if Britain does not deal with it intelligently, the complete disintegration of the British Empire is inevitable. Canada leaving London and heading to Washington is probably the first sound of this giant house collapsing.</p>

<h3>Financial News: Silver Prices and Exchange Rates Both Contract, Margin Recovers Five Yuan Six</h3>
<p>Austrian-German Telegrams Frequently Report Setbacks Mid-Journey ▲</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw silver prices and exchange rates both contract, leading to a recovery in prices. Although the market was stable and consolidating throughout the day, the morning began with declines in overseas silver markets, both in London (flat) and the US (contracting). The Gold Exchange saw forward silver prices contract by between 0.5 and 1.3 fen. Exchange rates also decreased. London raw gold rose by 0.5 pence, US cotton fell by 4 points, US wheat fell by 1.25 points, and stocks plummeted by 6.06 yuan. This led to a reactionary sentiment. Commodity margins opened higher, rising to around 90 yuan. Pre-market trading saw Shunmao, Fuxing, Yongyi, Fengyongchengkang and others actively buying, pushing the price up further to over 91 yuan. After the opening, although banks were initially reluctant to buy, the market found equilibrium between supply and demand, causing prices to rise and fall. Later, with repeated purchases by large players and the anticipation of a sudden contraction in HSBC's listed US dollar exchange rate by 0.125, market sentiment was greatly boosted. Banks, which had been reluctant, became more eager to buy, tightening the exchange market and making the gold market exceptionally firm. However, as the price was pushed up too high, a reaction quickly followed. Reuters frequently transmitted telegrams about events in Austria and Germany, making it difficult for the market sentiment to sustain itself. Jin Cheng and Jiao Tong banks also sold US dollars, causing prices to gradually decline after the initial rise. However, the trend remained peaceful, and the price struggled around the 2 yuan level for quite some time. Subsequently, news from the Seattle overnight silver market reported declines of 0.25, 0.375, 0.375, and 0.25, causing a rally. Despite the rally, it was ultimately difficult to maintain stability, and the underlying trend remained downwards. Furthermore, rumors circulated that the current US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau was about to resign, and that silver advocate Senator Pittman was likely to take office. The market believed that this would herald a recovery in silver prices, leading to more aggressive selling and a break below the 90 yuan level. However, this news has not yet been officially confirmed by telegram. The mid-day close saw a stable situation. In the afternoon, news of further declines in the Seattle overnight silver market of 0.125, 0.375, 0.125, and 0.25, initially stabilized the market, and off-exchange trading became active. However, with a sudden surge in supply at high prices, banks became reluctant to buy again, leading to a downward trend after the opening. Nevertheless, the underlying trend was stable. News from Bombay reported a decline of 1 anna, allowing the market to find equilibrium between supply and demand, supporting the price and preventing significant changes. The price of pure gold was 1005.4 yuan, with a swap spread of around 3.5 yuan. It is rumored that eastern goods will arrive soon. Having recorded the market situation for the day,</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 991.4 yuan, a recovery of 5.1 yuan compared to the previous close. Commodity openings were at the same price. The morning opening exchange rates were 1 shilling 4.125 pence for recent English exchange and 33.8125 yuan for US exchange. Dafa Yongfuchang, Fuxing Yongzhaofeng, Changtianfengyong all advanced. Citibank bought November US dollars at 1.875, rising to 1.9 yuan. Yuqing Yongyuan Maoyongdadacheng came to sell, falling to 0.05 yuan. Fuchang Fuxing Yongda Dacheng were eager to buy, gradually rising, anticipating HSBC's listing of English being flat and US contracting by 0.125. The bank bought November US dollars at 0.125. Tongchun Chengkang Fuchang Qianchangxiang advanced again, rising to 4.5 yuan. Reuters still had news of Austrian events coming in. Yuanmao Yongda Dacheng Bingxing Yuanfeng Yongyuan Changyong Fuchang Hengyu Zhaofeng Changcui Taiyifeng Yong sold within 2 yuan, hovering. Yu, Zhaofengchang Tongtaichang sold again at 1.2 yuan. Jiao Tong had sold to McCallum November US dollars at 1.875. Shunli Fuxing Yong took advantage of the low price to buy, stabilizing the situation. Seattle overnight silver prices reported a contraction of 0.25. HSBC bought November shillings at 0.25. Hengyu Fuchang Huixiang Da Dacheng Laijin advanced, rising to 2.8 yuan. Fuyu Yuqing Yongcui Taidadacheng Huixiang sold strips and went downstream. After entering, Changsheng Yongzhaofengchang Yifeng Yong advanced, there was a rumor in the market that the US Treasury Secretary resigned and Pittman succeeded. Fuxing Yong Yuqing Yong sold at 89.9 yuan. Hengyu Dadacheng Bingxing Huixiang took advantage of the low price to buy back, and then rose to 91 yuan. Fuxing Yong sold to retail investors, and Dekang also sold. Shunli Tianfeng Yong then advanced, and the competition was quite balanced. The midday closing price was 990.6 yuan, with commodities bidding at 1 yuan. After the closing, Tianfengyong Fuyu and others still advanced, rising to over 1.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening price rose to 992.8 yuan, with commodities opening at 2.7 yuan, because the overnight silver price had fallen another 0.125. (The off-exchange price once reached 3.5 yuan, and Hengxing immediately sold.) After the opening, Citibank sold August US dollars at 0.8125. Yifeng Yongfuyu Fuxing Yongda Dacheng Shunmao Yuqing Yong sold, falling to 1.6 yuan. Yongli Qianchangxiang Da Dacheng advanced to 2.2 yuan. Dingkang sold and retreated to within 2 yuan. Bombay fell by 1 anna, and the situation remained flat. Tianfeng Qianchangxiang still advanced, rising to 2.3 yuan. Shanghai sold September US dollars at 0.9375 and June US dollars at 34.0625. Dingkang and others sold strips, and the price retreated to 1.8 yuan again. Soon after, Hengyu Qianchangxiang Fuyu came to advance, rising to over 2 yuan. Tianfeng Yuanyida Xingyong further advanced to 2.6 yuan. Pan Gen sold November US dollars at 1.875, and commodities and Fuxing Yong took advantage of the high price to supply strips, retreating to 1.7 yuan. The closing price was 991.9 yuan, and the commodity bid was at the same price. After the market closed, although Fuxing Yong sold, because commodities Hengtai Fuyu all advanced, it finally rose to over 2 yuan. The highest price during the day was 994.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 989.9 yuan, a fluctuation of 4.6 yuan. As a result, it rose by 5.6 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on HSBC's US dollar exchange rate contracting by 0.125 to 33.5 yuan, equivalent to a margin price of slightly below 1033 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 41 yuan, less than 2 yuan less than the previous close. The August ledger price was 995 yuan, and the September price was 991 yuan. The morning top-up was 995 yuan, and the afternoon top-up was 996 yuan. The price of pure gold was 1005.4 yuan, and spot trading in the market was very stable. Tianjin goods were priced at an additional 15.25 yuan, sold by the Tianjin gang to Taikang Runying Fenghong, totaling about 2800 taels. In addition, the transactions were relatively quiet. Eastern goods will arrive today, about 23,000 taels. The swap situation was chaotic. Dingtai paid Ying Fenghong 63 strips at 3.4 yuan. After that, Yuan Fa Yongxing Tianfenghong's advances and retreats were chaotic, generally from 3.3 yuan to 3.6 yuan. In the afternoon, Yongde paid Qianchangxiang 70 strips at 3.2 yuan, and another 210 strips at 3.3 yuan. Yongde then paid Tongfenghong 35 strips, rising to 3.5 yuan. The Central Bank seemed to slightly open up spot purchases, as there were rumors in the market at noon. There were 17,304 August strips left, with a total of 9 long positions and 27 short positions.</p>
<p>Market trading was balanced. In summary, Fuchang Qianchangxiang Hengyu Taiheng Bingxing Fuan Huiyuan Hongxing Yuansheng Yongfuyu Da Dacheng Tianfeng Daxing Yong Tianfengyong were on the buying side. Shunli Yuanmao Yongyu Hengxing Yicheng Tongyi Cuitai Yongfengcheng Dingtai Xianghe Yongli Wan were on the selling side. Bingyi Kang Yuanchang Yongqing Yuanyixianchu Fengyong Fuxing Yongheng advanced and then retreated. Dalian Gang Shunli Yu had remaining strips. 600 strips were sold, and about 1400 strips were done, netting less than 500. The Guangdong Gang Shen Da was calm, and Hengxing slightly exited. There were 32,305 September futures chips, with a total of 39 long positions and 62 short positions. The total number of transactions on the day was 37,723 strips in the morning and 12,271 strips in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Foreign Short-Term Interest Rates Increase by One Point</h3>
<p>According to foreign short-term interest rates, since last month, they have been at 5 points. During this time, there have been minor changes for a day or two due to special circumstances, but the rest have been at 5 points. Yesterday, the market mostly saw various foreign firms starting to add to their autumn goods, so the market has slightly changed, but there has been no significant improvement. This is a rare situation in recent months. The foreign short-term interest rate was 6 points in both the morning and afternoon, an improvement of one point compared to the previous day. The initial market for "short-term" plus water was 2 points, but subsequently, the momentum was insufficient, so it was changed back to white short-term bill trading.

<h3>The Process of Public Debt Delivery in the Securities Market for July</h3>
<p>Total Amount: 66.6 Million Yuan</p>
<p>96 Accounts for One-Tenth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 27th, was the delivery date for July futures at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The total delivery amount was as high as 66.6 million yuan. Among them, the amount settled by the brokers themselves through mutual clearing was 50,690,000 yuan. The amount delivered at the exchange was 15,910,000 yuan, with 96 bonds accounting for the largest proportion, accounting for one-tenth of the total. Most of the transactions were arbitrage, with low capital and high profits, which attracted people. The delivery process was quite smooth. Generally, the majority of those taking delivery were large investors and financial institutions, while the majority of those delivering were retail investors. The bond process was extremely smooth, and it can be regarded as one of the best quarters in the current year and in recent years. The July futures, from the beginning to the end, were slightly hit by the Zhang Ben incident in the middle, but the remaining periods were mostly smooth sailing, gradually rising, and new high prices emerged endlessly. The rising trend was truly unimaginable. The miracle of the rising trend on July 7 was particularly unexpected, with a general rise of 10 yuan. The reasons for the rise were mostly due to the following reasons: the suppression of bandits was significantly victorious, Zhang Ben was lost and recovered, the Ministry of Finance investigated the treasury of banks, and the opening of traffic was realized. Afterwards, due to political turmoil, Mr. Huang Fu was late in going north, and the market price was slightly sluggish, but it was of no great significance. However, since rumors of the reorganization of 96 public bonds came on July 5, speculators took advantage of it to crazily push up and buy, which led to the senseless surge to the limit on July 9. However, it was not allowed by the facts, and the next day it crashed to the limit again. It rose and fell like a hare, completely manipulated by speculators. After the Ministry of Finance announced that it would not reorganize the news, most of the speculators had withdrawn from the front line, leaving only a handful of retail investors, trying to find fish in trees. Therefore, public bonds without investment value must not blindly follow speculation. Therefore, the falling wind of 96 bonds will still have aftershocks in this short period of time. The total number of July futures delivery clearing and transactions is listed below (unit: hundreds of yuan).</p>

<h3>European Turmoil Causes Sharp Drop in New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (the 26th), the New York stock market plummeted by about 10 yuan due to the sudden news of war in Europe. The severity of the decline was unprecedented this year. The market had already been affected by the drought and national strikes, so once the shorts boldly attacked, it collapsed rapidly. Large and small speculators, feeling that their margin was insufficient, threw out shares one after another. European sales were like a tidal wave. About 3 million shares were traded today, creating a new low record for the year. The ticker tape was delayed, and the market was six minutes behind. The price difference between buyers and sellers was as high as 11 yuan, and the chaos was evident. The hardest hit were US Steel, General Motors, Chrysler, and General Electric, all of which reached new lows. The market only had the ability to resist in the last hour, recovering about one yuan. Stocks on the Small Exchange also reached new lows for the year. The bond market also experienced a sharp decline, with speculative bonds being particularly hard hit. However, US government bonds were only down one yuan, and Austrian, German, and Italian bonds were down several to seven yuan. (Grains) Although the visible supply of spot goods and news were favorable to the long side, prices were still dragged down by the stock market. The total daily volume was 3.34 million shares. According to the agent's report, the market, which had been weak and unstable for several days, was further fueled by the Austrian coup. However, we believe that the Austrian situation is not as bad as generally imagined, so if the market continues to weaken tomorrow, there should be a sharp rebound. (Wheat) Due to the sharp declines in stocks and bonds, wheat longs also divested. There was a large sale of flour, which confirmed that the eastern US had bought far-term contracts during the crash. The outlook has not changed, and it is possible to buy. (Cotton) The market was relatively stable, due to unconfirmed news that the cotton crop had suffered damage from strong winds and rain, and that crops were withering due to drought in several places, causing farmers to complain. The market activity was excellent. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Prices Fall Less Than Expected, Speculative Yarn Rises to Compensate</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned flat, because the long side had expected a sharp fall in US cotton prices, but the telegrams only reported a small decline of 5 points, causing market sentiment to stabilize slightly. At the same time, current yarn sales were still able to be maintained, so sales decreased. In the afternoon, there was some discussion in the business community that the European political turmoil might not expand. As a result, the situation turned calm again.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Slightly Rises by Six or Seven Fen</h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn futures market, the market sentiment was stable because the decline in US cotton prices was not significant, and there were not many sellers in the market. The market gradually moved upward, but buying was not strong. Each month rose slightly by two, three, or four fen. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Austrian political situation was not expected to change much, and speculative activity to compensate led the market to feel slightly tighter. However, the number of transactions was very small. As a result, each month rose another two, three, or five fen. The total number of transactions for the day was 15,600 bales. Dafeng sold 1,400 bales, Hengyi 350 bales, Mingde 750 bales, Shenji 800 bales, Yuanyi 500 bales, Yuantai 1,000 bales, Yichang 500 bales, Yuanda 300 bales, and Changfeng 350 bales. Xiecheng bought 1,050 bales, Gengfeng 550 bales, Taixing 850 bales, Huikang 700 bales, Changyu 450 bales, Renfeng 700 bales, Taichang 450 bales, and Tongxing 350 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>

<p>Total 243,300</p>
<h3>Actual Sales of 1,100 Bales</h3>
<p>Current yarn sales are still good. The total number of bales bought by various groups for the day was 1,100. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Wuhu 25 Mainland 190 Shantou 23 Qingdao 30</p>
<p>Sichuan 30 North Group 173 Nanjing 12 Guangdong 430</p>
<p>Changsha 20 Tianjin 10</p>
<p>The cotton market turned up, and the situation was tighter, because the decline on the previous day was too severe, and most people expected a sharp decline in US cotton prices. Today's telegrams reported a slight drop of 3 to 5 points, stabilizing market sentiment. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and the market turned tighter. However, the number of transactions in the market was small. Current cotton mill sales in the market are still sluggish, so new buyers have not been enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao's After-Market Recovers Well</h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton futures market, the market atmosphere was tight because there was a lack of new sellers, and US cotton only fell by 3 to 5 points, and Indian cotton tended to rise. As a result, the imaginary wind of the previous day completely dissipated, but buyers were not seen in the market, and each month rose by 0.5 to 1 dime. In the afternoon, it was heard that the news was favorable to the long side, and that US cotton would rise tomorrow, so speculative compensation caused each month to rise by 1.5 to 2 dimes. The total number of transactions for the day was 66,900 dan. Yuanda sold 1,100 dan, Meiji 1,300 dan, Jifeng 1,800 dan, Dafu 3,800 dan, Dafeng 1,700 dan, Shenji 1,700 dan, Changfeng 4,700 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,200 dan, Changyu 1,200 dan, and Tonghe 1,400 dan.

<h3>Raw Cotton Mill Consumption is Sluggish</h3>
<p>Raw cotton consumption is quiet, and the intake of various factories is quite sluggish. The source is estimated at 230 bales of Yao cotton. The current price of cotton is listed below.</p>
<p>Ling Cotton 54.50 Hankou First Factory Intake 200 Spot Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 42.50 Hengfeng Factory Intake 1,000 Spot Warehouse Delivery</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Slightly Down, British and Indian Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially firmed due to cotton crop damage, but later weakened due to Wall Street's decline and political news favoring sellers. As a result, spot prices fell by five points, and futures fell by four to seven points. British cotton futures rose by one to three points. The Indian cotton market was firm, with Pingal rising by one rupee, and Omra and White Rose Creek rising by seven and a half annas. (Originally recorded by telegraph, 26th).</p>

<h3>First Batch of New Pudong Japonica Rice Arrives</h3>
<p>— Eleven Stones of Rice Sold Out Instantly</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dongxin rice was the first to hit the market this year. A total of eleven stones of the rice were transported from Zhoupu, Pudong, to Shanghai, and milled white for sale by the Xinchang Factory. The rice was dry, clean, and pure. Being a seasonal delicacy, the local shops were very eager, competing to purchase it, creating a lively scene. It was sold out in an instant for a price of twelve yuan. It is reported that a large batch is on its way and expected to arrive today. The harvest is estimated to be about 70-80%.</p>
<h3>Hexia Rice Market Improves by One or Two Corners</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various groups provided rice numbered 12 or 13 (approximately 2,000 stones). After the market stabilized from the previous day, the opening trend showed an upward momentum. The prices of regular Japonica rice from groups like Su, Tong, and Nan'gang, as well as late rice varieties like Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xilian, gradually rose by two corners. As the market rebounded, sellers increased their asking prices. However, buyers' sentiments fluctuated, leading to a stagnant market near noon. The sales of various grades like Duyangjian and Yinbianyuan remained limited, relying on the stability of Japonica rice.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, rice numbered 11 or 12 arrived from various sources in Hexia. High-grade white Japonica rice sold well in the market, while medium-grade rice continued to sell moderately. Early rice and high-quality Yangdujian were actively traded, and Kejian rice showed slight movement. The price of market white Japonica rice increased by one or two corners, while the price of thin rice Baiyuan rice remained stable. Early rice Dujian increased by about two corners, high-quality Yangjian increased by two or three corners, medium-grade rice increased slightly, and Kejian rice increased by nearly one corner.</p>
<h3>Foreign Xian Rice Suddenly Rises by Two Corners</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Xian rice market continued its upward trend. After the market opened,囤户 (storehouse owners) expected prices to rise due to the continuing dry weather and widespread reports of disasters, including in Hunan, anticipating a poor harvest this year. Local囤積者 (stockpilers) were eager to be active, causing a market frenzy. A total of 850 packages of Hunan Jingjiang rice in the mill (機磨) and coarse (糙) varieties were sold. In addition, 1,431 packages of Hankou and Shashi coarse rice, 144 packages of Wuxi Xian rice, and 1,006 packages of Chuzhou machine-milled rice were sold, with prices increasing by one to nearly two corners. The sales of foreign rice were active, and since there were no fixed-price transactions (定米軋脚), although market inventory exceeded 50,000 packages, they were held by powerful groups, naturally creating scarcity and driving up prices. Yesterday, due to continued active sales by the Beiyang group and interest from the mainland, prices surged by two corners, with sellers reluctant to sell more. A total of 3,000 packages of Xiaojiao rice were offered, with the highest price at 8 yuan and 5.5 jiao, followed by 2 corners. Given the current situation, further price increases are feared.</p>
<h3>Wheat Flour Futures Market Softens</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened this morning, the prices for all months showed a consistent trend of flatness and weakness. The quotations for foreign wheat from Chicago and Canada were down by about four to five corners. Therefore, sentiment was already loosening when prices opened. Although demand for spot goods was still active from the Beiyang group for this month due to approaching delivery, the difference between short-term and long-term prices for some hedging transactions in the exchange was only two or three corners, which was significantly different from the previous difference of more than one corner, causing multi-party to give up and sentiment to subside. The long-term market also softened due to reduced participation from external speculators and frequent profit-taking. Furthermore, the rain in Shandong province is expected to slightly reduce the temporary need for grain supplies. The market rumor that foreign flour is coming to China may become a reality, leading to a consistently bearish outlook. As a result, this month's price was down by one fen, August was down by two fen and 2 li, September was down by two fen and 7 li, October was down by three fen and 2 li, November was down by two fen and 2 li, and December was down by one fen and 7 li.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened this morning, the prices for all months showed signs of decline. The quotations for foreign wheat were down by about four to five corners. Therefore, when prices opened, this month's price immediately opened lower by two corners and six fen, and then continued to fall slightly to two corners and one fen, a significant drop of one corner and one fen compared to the previous day's closing price. Of the delivery volume in the exchange, 70-80% were inspected, and it is said that only about 20 vehicles were actually deliverable, causing great uncertainty. The opening prices for longer-term contracts also fell by a few fen. Later, this month's price recovered as non-compliant deliveries were automatically taken back, eventually rising to three corners and one fen, only slightly down by one fen. Longer-term contracts also tended to fluctuate in the same way. As the North Road grain price leveled off, it is feared that prices will continue to fall slightly. As a result, this month was down by one fen, August was down by four fen, September was unchanged, October was down by one fen, November was unchanged, December was up by one fen. Spot wheat saw no activity as factories wanted to reduce prices by a few fen, while customers wanted to hold on to their positions.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms See Little Improvement in Silk Sales</h3>
<p>Lyons Raw Silk Prices Fall Endlessly. In the Lyons raw silk market, silk factories generally adhere to the principle of buying materials as needed, lacking substantial purchases. Meanwhile, Japanese silk imports remain strong, actively dumping at low prices, causing Chinese silk prices to follow suit. According to a telegram received by the Credit Foncier d'Extrême-Orient (信孚洋行), the price of Shanghai white factory Grade A Xinchang Map brand (信昌圖牌) was only 56.5 francs, and the price of Grade B Three Dancing brand (三跳舞牌) was 53 francs, a drop of 1.5 francs per kilogram compared to last week.</p>
<p>Large quantities of Summer Dry Cocoons Shipped from Zhejiang to Shanghai. This year, Zhejiang's summer silkworm production has been affected by dry weather, resulting in a reduced cocoon yield. Few silk cocoon merchants in Shanghai went to purchase summer cocoons, and most were bought by local cocoon firms, dried into dry cocoons, and shipped to Shanghai for sale. In recent days, a total of over 2,700 packages of summer dry cocoons have arrived from Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and other places via both water and land routes, and most have been stored in the banks' warehouses in the Garbage Bridge area.</p>
<p>Silk Merchants Continue to Purchase at Low Prices. The Shanghai Chinese silk market in the foreign firms' area has become alarmed due to the repeated sharp declines in overseas raw silk prices. The New York futures price for December silk was only $1.13 per pound (gold yuan), further dampening sentiment. Those holding inventory dared not hold on, leading British firms and inland silk merchants to purchase at low prices. The trading volume was not weak. It is estimated that Renji and others purchased 150 packages of Grade B Shanghai He factory silk (滬禾廠經), further depressing prices.</p>
<h3>Chinese Tea Sales Vary in Smoothness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in the foreign firms' area in Shanghai varied in smoothness. Major trading firms in England and France still had strong interest in high-quality Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi and Shexian, with many orders coming from Morocco. However, tea from Wuyuan and the Northwest, despite their superior leaf quality and processing, remained quiet and listless due to the increase in tea tax in the Gallon region. Although the sales of tea from Tunxi and Shexian remained smooth, prices continued to decline. The green tea market showed signs of weakness. Inventories of high-grade and mid-grade black tea from Qining and other regions were scarce, while low-grade tea was overproduced in Hunan and Hubei, leading to price declines with no increase.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Nuts: Jinshan Branches Further Decrease by About Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the new Jinshan branches (金山枝) came on the market, arrivals have been increasing daily. More than 1,000 boxes have arrived so far, and another 2,000 boxes are expected to arrive within the day. Therefore, prices have fallen by three or four yuan in the past two days. The higher-quality Yuan branches are priced at 39 yuan, followed by 33 and 4 yuan, respectively. The higher-quality flat branches are priced at 45.5 yuan, followed by around 40 yuan. Market sentiment may continue to loosen. However, as prices reach lower levels, it may stimulate strong sales. New Quanzhou Yuan Hong branches and Xinghua Yuan Xiang branches are expected to arrive next week.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Rong Gang Purchases Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>During the hot season, the trade in woolen fabrics has largely stalled in this area. However, various申莊 (Shanghai-based merchants) in客埠 (outports) have inquired and expressed their need, since their transport takes time to adapt to autumn sales. The Xiaochuan Rong Gang (小川蓉帮), of祥裕公 (Xiangyu Gong), 恊記興 (Xieji Xing), 益記 (Yiji), and 集祥 (Jixiang) businesses, have been purchasing woolen fabrics. There have been negotiations for direct-weave melton, plain, thick broadcloth, and domestically produced camel hair, which are cheap and moderately priced. Baodali's plain, thick broadcloth in dark navy was sold eight boxes, each yard selling at a net price of 1.24 yuan (foreign currency). Ruiwen's No. 1300 was sold five boxes, priced at 2.9 yuan. Over a hundred yards of unbranded scraps of light patterned fabrics were priced at 3.1 yuan. A certain Feng business offered 40,000 of the Japanese original straight-weave flannel, priced at 5.4 yuan.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Debate and Scolding</h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>When a pressing issue arises, bringing everyone's abilities together to systematically debate the issue itself, the result may not always be the discovery of truth, but a far greater understanding of the issue is assured. During the Zhou and Qin dynasties, the development of Chinese scholarship was largely due to debate.</p>
<p>Scolding, while sometimes similar to debate, is fundamentally different. When discussing an issue, if it degenerates into scolding, it can deviate from the topic, like a shrew scolding in the street, even dragging in the other party's ancestors for three generations. This can go on for three to five years, only harming the harmony between the parties and providing little benefit to the issue itself.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, many events have occurred in our literary circles in recent years, and a considerable number of people have participated in discussions. However, in each discussion, most people wave the banner of debate, engaging in mutual scolding. If we have the time, we might as well take out the articles from previous "debates" (—) and reread them carefully. It's quite interesting... We can see many brave "warriors" willing to abandon the core of the issue under discussion, focusing instead on scrutinizing the other party's words, looking for loopholes and weaknesses, seizing upon these vulnerabilities to unleash a torrent of abuse, even bestowing a golden hoop on the other party, preventing any movement. How many debates have reached a satisfactory conclusion?</p>
<p>Originally, if one were facing a truly powerful enemy and lacked the strength to confront them with force, seizing the opportunity to hurl abuse could indeed alleviate distress. However, those participating in discussions on a particular issue share the goal of moving the issue in a new direction, so why resort to scolding among fellow travelers?</p>
<p>Scolding has become a widespread phenomenon in our literary circles today. If a publication allows the discussion of a particular issue to continue, all that will be seen is the exchange of mutual abuse.</p>
<p>A group of children playing together might start scolding and fighting over a small matter. Most people consider this childish and laugh at their ignorance. However, how different are the many jumping and shouting characters in our literary circles from this? The only thing the children don't know is that "scolding is the secret to fame"!</p>
<h3>On Transcendence</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Extremes, whether too hasty or too slow, are not easily welcomed by those of a certain status. Being too hasty would impede their interests, which would be detrimental to them, so they must oppose it first and foremost. At the same time, being too slow is also too uninteresting, with nothing new to talk about, making them feel too lonely, which is equally bad. Therefore, the best approach is neither too hasty nor too slow, neither harming their bodies nor allowing the enemies to remain too silent and inactive. This way, they have something to do, and life doesn't become too meaningless.</p>
<p>Neither hasty nor slow, observers call it the middle way</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>, or transcendence. Transcendence is most favored by those who consider themselves to be of a certain status, because it allows them to have a position outside of haste and slowness, expressing neutrality and separating themselves from the masses. What a noble position! Those who are hasty or slow seem to be among the common people, struggling for power and profit, while only the transcendent can hold their heads high, detached from the world, preserving their purity. But this is just deception.</p>
<p>To cater to the psychology of the aforementioned people, they often explicitly state that their attitude is not to understand the trends of the times, but rather to believe in gradual improvement. They neither prostrate themselves before the ancients nor are dictated to by trends. They do not sing high-pitched songs that resound through the clouds, nor do they harshly criticize the old feudal clan, nor do they solely blame foreigners (imperialist oppression), but only blame themselves for being too uncompetitive, and so on. What beautiful words, what a pure identity! However, they are merely playing the old game of transcendence and moderation.</p>
<p>The transcendent believe themselves to be transcendent, but in reality, they do not transcend, nor will they ever transcend. There is no other way than to be hasty or slow, to be left or right, to be forward or backward. There is really nothing else in between. For example, a pendulum is either to the left or to the right. There is no time when it is stopped in the middle unless it is not moving. Even if it is stopped in the middle, everything to the left of the center point, whether far or near, is still on the left. Conversely, the same is true on the right. Where is the position outside of left and right? In reality, it does not exist. Yet the transcendent always believes themselves to be transcendent, but in reality, they are not transcendent and will never be transcendent.</p>
<p>However, the reason why the transcendent claim to be transcendent has its own certain function. This function is to use the attitude of transcendence to deceive those who are not transcendent. Those who are not transcendent understand very well that there is no position of transcendence in the world; one must either move forward or retreat. The actual meaning of the transcendent's call for them to be transcendent is actually a call for them not to move forward, because the transcendent are actually against moving forward. This is the origin of why the transcendent claim to be transcendent, and it is also the essence of the transcendent.</p>
<p>The more tense the objective contradictions become, the more transcendent there are. The transcendent claim to be transcendent, but in reality, they are helping those who are not moving forward and are serving as the main pillar for those who are retreating. However, those who are not transcendent and are moving forward will eventually use practice to break this net of transcendence and deception. At the same time, when contradictions reach their most tense point, even those who are moving forward will abandon the help of the transcendent and directly deal with the other side of not being transcendent with an attitude that is not transcendent. At that time, I think the transcendent can only reach the point of being abandoned. Originally, there is no position for those who are free in the middle; it is either forward or backward. This is the objective fact, and no matter how much the transcendent transcends, how can it escape this restriction in reality?</p>
<h3>Temporary Secretary</h3>
<p>— Qiu</p>
<h3>Agen</h3>
<p>— Shuxian</p>
<p>Here, you can't find a clean, white wall or a fair-skinned face, let alone a hint of women's perfume. The sides of the road are littered with dilapidated thatched huts, and the streets and lanes are filled with the pungent odor of urine and feces and the heavy smell of mud and dust.</p>
<p>A line of thick black smoke pours from the terribly long and narrow factory window, flowing diagonally across the gloomy sky. Small grains of coal slag are blown away by the morning wind, scattering like fine rain over the roofs and ground of the nearby thatched huts.</p>
<p>Woo! Woo! Woo! The factory's sharp echo sounded three times intermittently. The clock on the towering clock tower pointed precisely at five o'clock.</p>
<p>"Click"! The two tightly closed iron gates in front of the factory slowly opened! Three or four gate guards with pistols at their waists stood solemnly on both sides of the gate, like a few terrifying fangs in the wide-open bloody mouth, waiting for food to be thrown into the gaps between the teeth.</p>
<p>Slowly, countless yellow and gaunt faces emerged from the many dilapidated thatched huts. The whip of life lashed at the back of each face, driving them one by one to throw themselves into the hideous bloody mouth, disappearing into a large, old building through the gaps between the fangs.</p>
<p>The clock on the clock tower moved forward minute by minute. The small barren square in front of the factory gradually became lively with the progress of the clock. Vendors, idle street heroes, and some unemployed workers looking for substitute work mingled together in a chaotic and clamorous scene.</p>
<p>Since being laid off from another factory three months ago, Agen had been coming to this small square for a month, mingling with the unemployed workers, waiting on an empty stomach to find substitute work.</p>
<p>"There's hope today, right?" Every time Agen ran into this small square, a great hope immediately appeared in his mind, hoping to find a day or a few days of substitute work, to bring back a few dimes or a few yuan of wages, so he could eat a few more full meals. But things did not turn out as he imagined. Now, after waiting for more than a month, he hadn't gotten a single day of substitute work.</p>
<p>"Could it be that none of the workers are getting sick now, not missing a single day of work?" Agen wondered, his wide eyes fixed on every worker entering the factory, feeling exceptionally envious!</p>
<p>The time for workers to enter was gradually passing. Agen sighed dejectedly.</p>
<p>"Agen!" Suddenly a sharp call. Agen promptly noticed a burly foreman standing by the iron gate, beckoning him.</p>
<p>Agen rushed forward a few steps, grabbed a gate pass from the foreman's hand, and calmly stepped into the gate. He happened to look back and saw the many hungry eyes watching him from outside the gate. He lowered his head and walked sadly towards the clattering workshop.</p>
<p>"Why is substitute work so hard to find these days?" Agen worked and chatted idly with the worker on his left.</p>
<p>"The wages are too low now, not even enough to eat. Unless it's absolutely necessary, who would be willing to stop working?"</p>
<p>"Could it be that the low wages are preventing people from getting sick?" Agen wondered.</p>
<p>"Sick? Unless you're already lying in bed and can't get up, as long as your legs can still move a few steps, everyone still has to squeeze into the factory to struggle, even if they're sick, the old and the young at home still need to eat! Moreover, the factory doesn't allow too much time off now. Too much time off and you risk being fired. Take the person who does your work, for example. Because his hand was crushed yesterday, he stopped coming today, but he'll probably be back to work in a day or two, even though he's still in pain."</p>
<p>"Um!...".</p>
<p>The echo of the quitting bell sounded! Agen took the day's wages from the accounts room - four dimes and a dozen copper coins. He lowered his head, stepped out of the factory gate, and walked sadly towards the vague road ahead.</p>

<h3>Painful Memories</h3>
<p>— Bi</p>
<p>Day broke. From the narrow window, I could see some of the dawn's light. I stealthily crawled up from the floor in the corner, rubbed my numb and sore arms, my mind a complete mess, my spirit utterly weak. Sleep still clung to me. I thought, "I'll sleep a little longer; it's only five o'clock." Indeed, how could a fourteen-year-old child get enough sleep with only three hours a night? My blurry eyes were already drifting off, but in just an instant, another thought occupied my mind. I immediately woke up and looked at my aunt, that despotic demon, sleeping on the bed like a dead pig, snoring away. I shivered, forced myself to cheer up, and shook my deeply wounded heart. I didn't dare to look at her again and quickly rolled up the tattered mat and stuffed it into the corner.</p>
<p>I gently opened the door and went out onto the balcony. The red rays of the rising sun were shining from the east in the cool breeze, illuminating my face, so warm and comfortable. I yawned vigorously, stretched my arms and waist a few times, and the fatigue seemed to have been driven away for the most part. But as I walked, my legs were still sore as if floating in the clouds, without a trace of strength. The blue and purple bruises that my aunt had inexplicably left on my thighs after twelve o'clock last night were still clearly etched there.</p>
<p>As soon as I became aware of that tyranny, my heart was filled with terror. And this terror seemed to benevolently or maliciously order me to quickly empty the chamber pot, wash the spittoon, sweep the house, and clean the clothes. I also had to buy the vegetables, wash them, and cook them. Meanwhile, my aunt, that demon, was still sleeping on the bed like a dead pig, snoring away. Perhaps she was also tired from beating me last night.</p>
<p>Perhaps this had already become commonplace. When I squatted in a small stove room that had to accommodate four or five families cooking, my eyes were almost blinded by the crisscrossing and pervading purple smoke. Tears flowed uncontrollably in waves, and before I even had time to wipe them away, a fierce and heavy slap came flying horizontally, followed by, "You worthless thing, you have good food to eat, what's wronged you that you have to shed tears in front of the kitchen god? Are you cursing me? If you make the family uneasy, don't even think about living!" My soul was truly scared out of my wits.</p>
<p>That night, the scolding continued until late into the night before it stopped. As soon as I closed my eyes, my legs felt like they were being bitten by poisonous insects. Rubbing them, they were covered in lumps. My heart felt like it was on fire. I thought... a child bride is a person, why should they live an inhuman life? When will her supreme tyranny end? When will my prisoner's fate see the light of day? ... I also once hopelessly hoped... "that the Bodhisattva who saves those from suffering would come to save me, this poor child bride." But I also once bravely thought of using my strength to strike down this evil demon, this selfish and self-interested thing, because I realized that to save myself, I needed my own strength! However, just as I was about to shout it out, I realized that fierce and chaotic slaps would descend on my face, my flesh, and even my thighs, so I silently swallowed everything I had planned.</p>
<p>Although these events have become painful memories of my childhood, every time I savor the taste of that life, I feel extreme terror in my heart! But sometimes I also regret and even curse myself for being so weak at that time. Wasn't it I who had received the revelation that "to save yourself, you need your own strength"? Why did I compromise and submit like a sheep from beginning to end? ...</p>
<h3>Cruel Humanity</h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>A Lin, the boatman, had just rowed his boat over from the opposite bank.</p>
<p>This boat. It’s no longer thriving. It was passed down from his father.</p>
<p>He is already fifty-eight years old this year. Accurately calculated, this rowing boat is definitely older than A Lin.</p>
<p>It was in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Before the boat had even come to a complete stop, he jumped ashore.</p>
<p>"Sir, my young son is seriously ill. His stomach hurts so much he's screaming! Do you have any 'sha' medicine water? Please give me some."</p>
<p>He said this to a gentleman he didn't recognize, who was enjoying the cool air at the ferry station.</p>
<p>"Sick? You should take him to the hospital!" the gentleman said, massaging his own foot.</p>
<p>"Yes! Sir, that's what I'm thinking too. But, but the hospital costs money!"</p>
<p>"Alas. No money? Then there's absolutely nothing one can do. Go on, we don't have any 'sha' medicine here either. ......"</p>
<p>"Sir, if he's sent to the hospital, how much will it cost?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know. If you have money, then you can send him to XX Hospital! There, there, our comprador's wife was also cured in a few days. Hmm, it's said that she also had a sudden case of 'sha' syndrome. ......"</p>
<p>"Okay, thank you! Sir."</p>
<p>A Lin frowned, said this, and jumped back onto the small boat.</p>
<p>He rowed desperately. Rowing to the opposite bank. He jumped ashore, panting, and ran. Rushing towards the thatched hut.</p>
<p>"A Lin, what should we do? Lin Di's complexion doesn't look good," his wife said, weeping.</p>
<p>"Send him...to the hospital!"</p>
<p>He said it without thinking.</p>
<p>"Where's the money?"</p>
<p>"Take the cotton clothes...all out to pawn them." He resented his own fate.</p>
<p>Then. Five bundles of clothes were carried on his back towards Dongzhen.</p>
<p>Five bundles of various sizes of cotton clothes. Only got three silver dollars.</p>
<p>Anxious. He carried his son onto the boat.</p>
<p>He, his wife, and Lin Di. The three of them. Lin Di lay still. The others were doing their best to row the boat.</p>
<p>The clock hand pointed to three o'clock when they carried Lin Di into the hospital. The street was quiet.</p>
<p>Going in through the first door. Registration fee, one silver dollar.</p>
<p>Carrying him into the examination room, Lin Di's hands were cold.</p>
<p>"Sir, please quickly ask the doctor to come and save his life!"</p>
<p>A Lin said to the nurse in white.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment! Got it."</p>
<p>She walked away, unconcerned.</p>
<p>After a while. The doctor came!</p>
<p>His hair and leather shoes were shiny. He sized A Lin up for a while, looked at Lin Di sleeping on the sickbed. Shook his head. Said.</p>
<p>"Hey! Are you planning to admit him? Three and a half dollars a day! If you do that, maybe there's hope! ......"</p>
<p>"Sir, can I pay later?"</p>
<p>A Lin wanted to grasp at the last shred of hope.</p>
<p>"No way! Pay the admission fee first! Originally, you had to pay for ten days. Seeing that you're poor, I'll just have you pay for five days first."</p>
<p>"Sir, do you have a cheaper room?"</p>
<p>"Who told you not to come earlier? It's all crowded!"</p>
<p>"Sir, we didn't expect him to get sick!"</p>
<p>They were desperate!</p>
<p>Lin Di's eyes were turning white.</p>
<p>"Sir, can you give him some life-saving medicine to eat? ......"</p>
<p>A Lin pleaded bitterly.</p>
<p>"Hmm. Unless he gets an injection!"</p>
<p>"Doesn't an injection cost money?" A Lin's wife said, rubbing her eyes, wanting one last reassurance.</p>
<p>"What? Our medicine isn't free!"</p>
<p>The doctor tugged at his stiff collar. Said.</p>
<p>"Sir, is two dollars enough? ......" A Lin begged.</p>
<p>"Go away! This isn't a place to buy things!"</p>
<p>The doctor stepped into the medical office.</p>
<p>Lin Di, his breath was gone.</p>
<p>A gatekeeper came to drive them out.</p>
<p>The elderly A Lin carried Lin Di out of the tall hospital building.</p>
<p>His wife was crying.</p>
<p>Heartbroken, they carried Lin Di onto the dilapidated boat.</p>
<p>Lin Di's eyes were wide open. His mouth was open, with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>The sun rose in the east.</p>
<p>The couple, exhausted, were rowing the boat.</p>

<h3>Wife's Infidelity</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Jia is twenty-three years old this year. He lost his mother at a young age. His father only had this one son. When he was nine years old, he was engaged to Miss Yi, a neighbor. The woman's family. Also only had one daughter, and no nephews or other relatives, so they thought that if their daughter married, the family would be lonely. Moreover, they would have no one to serve them in their old age, so they discussed with Jia's father, wanting to make Jia both their son-in-law and son. Jia's father thought this made sense and would be beneficial to both sides. He immediately agreed. So the two parties agreed and signed a contract. Each took a copy; and the matchmaker and the witness also stated in person that neither party would ever have any objections, and each party also took a wedding invitation, and they would choose a date to get married when the boy and girl grew up. The engagement was in the ninth year of the Republic. Jia was nine years old, and Yi was eight years old. Neither of them had developed knowledge and were ignorant of marriage matters. Everything was decided by their parents.</p>
<p>After the engagement, the two families lived together. Jia and Yi called each other brother and sister and went to the same school. They went out early and returned late, and were very close, and both parents were very happy. Later, Yi's father went to Shanghai to do business. Because of his business, he could not return to his hometown. In the eleventh year of the Republic, he took his wife and daughter to live in Shanghai. Yi's father made limited progress. He thought that his daughter had nothing to do in Shanghai. It would be better to have her work, so she could supplement the family income. So he entrusted a friend to recommend his daughter to a cigarette factory as a worker. This went on for five or six years. Jia was already sixteen years old. He had studied for seven or eight years. Yi's father returned to his hometown and brought Jia to Shanghai. Jia dropped out of school and came to Shanghai to learn a trade. More than half a year after Jia finished his apprenticeship, Yi's father passed away in Shanghai. Jia handled the funeral like a relative, offering the spirit tablet and wearing hemp clothes, and in the winter solstice of the nineteenth year. Together with Yi and her mother, they carried the coffin back to their hometown for burial. In the twentieth year of the Republic, Jia and Yi went to their hometown to get married. After the marriage, they continued to live in Shanghai. Jia worked as a shop assistant and earned a little each month. Yi also had wages to supplement their income. In addition, Yi's father had saved a little money when he was alive, so the three of them were able to live a moderately comfortable life. In the twenty-first year, Yi's mother fell ill and passed away in Shanghai.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>The funeral was still handled by Jia and Yi returning to their hometown. After the couple came to Shanghai from their hometown. Because the rent at the original place was too expensive. So they moved elsewhere and rented a one-room pavilion, with a monthly rent of six yuan. Jia worked as a shop clerk with a monthly income of five or six yuan, and Yi worked for more than twenty yuan or ten yuan per month. However, Jia and Yi were still able to make ends meet. Jia returned home to stay for five or six days each month. Unexpectedly, the tenants living in the back building were all men, three brothers, and none of them had wives. They used to work on foreign ships, but now they were unemployed. The second of them often saw Jia's wife entering and exiting alone, so he developed bad intentions. He often seduced her. Yi was ignorant and easily deceived, so they had a physical relationship. Jia often heard neighbors making sarcastic remarks, so he often paid attention. Over time, he found out, but he had no evidence, and his finances were tight, so it was difficult to speak out. Yi's behavior was different from before. When Jia came home. She treated him like a thorn in her side and often argued with him. Jia's father was still in his hometown and often told Yi to return to his hometown to live, but Yi refused to return to her hometown. Now Jia is in a dilemma. He doesn't want to abandon Yi. But he can't stand it. If things go on like this, he may inevitably be harmed by Yi and the man. Now there are several questions to ask the gentleman... First, if Jia first goes to court to accuse Yi of not being a virtuous wife and files for divorce, does Jia have to pay Yi alimony? Second, is it possible to accuse Bing of disrupting the family and seducing a married woman? Third, if Jia assassinates Yi and Bing, what crimes will they commit? If he flees elsewhere, will it harm Jia's father? Please answer the above three questions as soon as possible. I would be extremely grateful. I respectfully wish you peace and longevity. Gao Baisui</p>
<p>Answer: Your friend Mr. Jia, since his wife has committed adultery with another man, he had better file a criminal lawsuit in court, on the one hand to divorce Miss Yi, and on the other hand to accuse the man of seduction and disrupting the family. As for alimony, your friend does not need to pay it, because this kind of divorce is the fault of Miss Yi, how can she still ask for alimony? On the contrary, your friend can claim considerable compensation from the other party for the damages of the divorce. The above is the answer to your first two questions. For detailed information, you should consult a lawyer. As for the third question, your friend must never have such an idea. If this really happens, it will not only turn self-justification into unreasonableness, but also constitute the crime of murder in law. This is absolutely not allowed.</p>

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Enjoying the Cool Air (1)</h3>
<p>— Wenli</p>
<p>On a hot day, at night, the way rich and poor people enjoy the cool air is completely different.</p>
<p>Rich people, in addition to taking cars to the suburbs such as Jiangwan, Wusong, and Longhua Road, and taking yachts to cruise the Huangpu River, garden dance halls are a great gathering place to enjoy the cool air. Take the XXX Garden in the middle of Jing'an Temple Road as an example. Last night, N was pulled in by a friend C. A poor writer stepping into the crowd of gentlemen, ladies, wives, and old masters, his horizons were greatly expanded. This was because when he was stuck at home writing, it was so hot that he was sweating and had a headache. C ran over to see him, and N gave him a large palm-leaf fan, but he was still hot and shouting. C said he would take N to a place to enjoy the cool air. When N asked him where, C said XXX Garden. N thought to himself, if you open your mouth, it means spending money, you don't expect me to open my wallet, do you? After agreeing, he put on his coat and went out.</p>
<p>Sitting in the public bus, passing the Waibaidu Bridge, N saw through the bus window that the sidewalk on the east side was crowded with people. Most of them were shop assistants and workers from the Hongkou Broadway Road area. Some were wearing vests and shorts, holding a large palm-leaf fan in their hands, some were wearing short jackets with the tops open, some were leaning against the railing without moving, and some were walking back and forth—they were enjoying the cool air. Looking into the distance, the Bund Park reflected in his eyes, with a few scattered lights illuminating the park filled with people lying by the water and in the shade of the trees. In that park, the shadows of people were moving, vaguely visible, some sitting on the grass, some leaning against the railing by the water, and the rows of seats were even more filled with people. They were also enjoying the cool air.</p>
<p>The car arrived near Gordon Road. N followed his friend C out of the car. After walking a few steps, across the street was a brightly lit dance hall with dazzling neon lights. Black-plated cars filled the road beside it. N felt a wave of emotion—this is where people with black-plated cars come to enjoy the cool air, have fun, entertain, and do unspeakable things! N followed C into the gate, into the garden, and the rhythmic sound of music flew into N's ears. This is a dance hall, this is a dance hall, N's heart beat inexplicably. He looked up and saw the gentlemen, ladies, wives, and old masters sitting there enjoying the cool air. The poor writer felt like a country bumpkin, unconsciously uneasy—they were dressed so beautifully, and he was dressed so raggedly. Although he was wearing a suit, it was the suit of a street vagrant Russian! However, a thought immediately came to his mind—even though they are dressed so beautifully, the poor writer has his own pride, I still look down on you money-grubbing corpses and walking skeletons. This is what it means that consciousness overcomes the temptation of the environment, right? He walked past the gentlemen, ladies, wives, and old masters with a calm and confident demeanor.</p>
