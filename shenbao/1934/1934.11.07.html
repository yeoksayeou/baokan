<p>時評</p>
<h3>私運華人入美與美國排華移民律</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>最近有三十八個華僑。由西印度英屬千里達島（Trinidad）偷渡入美。當船抵美國海岸的時候。有四人病重不起。即被包辦偷運的黨徒丢入大海。其餘三十四人中。有十八人已被美政府密探查獲。行將驅逐出境。遺回中國。再有十六人則業經漏網。亦在嚴緝之中。</p>
<p>這種偷渡入美的勾當。僑界中稱做「偷關。」作者曾在西印度羣島作客二年。時時聽到華僑「偷關」的新聞。亦曾和「偷關」失敗了的華僑屢次談話。「偷關」的危險。他們並非不知道。可是失敗的儘管失敗。而嘗試的還是嘗試。原來西印度羣島。地處熱帶。所出産的。不過是糖·烟葉·和咖啡等農産品。年來。這些農産品供過於求。價格暴跌。便影響到當地的經濟繁榮。一般華僑的生計經歷了嚴重打擊。才至鋌而走險。「偷關」到美國去求食。</p>
<p>每名華僑實行「偷關」以前。至少亦得向那包辦偷運的黨徒。繳納五百元美金的費用。他們在偏僻地點。趁着昏夜。鬼鬼祟祟的下了時前預備好的船。一葉扁舟。擠滿了人。在熱帶海面上顛盪。本來已是非人的生活。而况又怕被外界發覺。只好匍匐在船艙的底層。甚至煤堆中挣命。有時候。他們從甲島一個地點出發。挨了多少天的苦。最後船中人説美國到了。於是在黑暗中悄悄的登了陸。自以爲大功告成了。不料天明時睜眼一看。依然是甲島。所換的不過是另一地點。亦只好自認晦氣。有時候。船進了美國的領海。海關緝私船發覺了。前來搜查。包辦偷運的黨徒。眼見逃避不了。硬「船客」綑綁起來。丢入大海。餵鯊魚去。如果緝私船近在咫尺。丢人入海。還不免留個痕跡。那末。索性撩入烈燄飛騰的洪爐。一煞那間化爲灰燼。</p>
<p>「偷關」的人好僥倖的挨到了美國海岸。而行蹤不密。依然得被人家發覺出來。那時。仍須身入囹圄。審明罪狀之後。驅回原地。而原居留國的政府。對於這種「偷關」華僑。又往往認爲不良份子。不容重行入境。仍須逐回中國。結果只落得兩頭落空。這些被逐回國的可憐蟲。就在回國途中。亦和罪犯相去無幾。而所謂回國。亦只指送到上海爲止。西印度華僑。差不多完全是廣東人。從上海到廣東的川資。還得另籌才行。最運幸的。要算是安渡難關的人了。但亦祇能晝伏夜出。見不得天日。尤其在「唐人街」的「搜册」期間。更覺狼狽不堪。</p>
<p>我們論到華人的「偷關」慘劇。不能不連帶歸咎於美國殘酷的排華移民律。没有這些移民律。華人入美。儘可如美人入華那樣的冠冕堂皇。何必如此的偷偷摸摸。</p>
<p>中美間關於移民問題的條約。共有三種。第一種是一八六八年的蒲安臣條約。該約第五欵。承認變更居住「爲天賦的與不可割讓的人權。」（據英文木譯。）可説是最平等的條約了。第二種是一八八○年的中美續約。該約第一欵雖准許美國可以「整理」或「限定」華工入美的人數和其在美的年數。但仍明白聲明「並非禁止」華工。而且該項「定限係專指華人續往美國承工者而言。其餘各項人等。均不在限制之列。」第三種是一八九四年的華工條約。那纔有更澈底的禁止華工入美的規定。但該約乃以十年爲期。到了一九○四年的一月二十四日。中國政府即聲明將該約作廢了。一九○四年以後。直到現在。中美間並未再有任何關於中國移民的新條約成立。換句話説。中國往美國去的移民。關於工人部分的。應准照一八八○年的中美續約辦理。關於非工人部分的。應准照一八六八年的蒲安臣條約辦理。可是美國政府的行政和立法當局。竟制定并頒布了許多極苛刻的内國法令。取締華人入境。不管法令的内容是否和現行的中美條約相衝突。根據美國憲法。美國和他國訂結的條約。與聯邦政府的法令。都算是國家的最高法。但據華盛頓大理院的判例。如内國法令和國際條約相衝突。法院判案時。應以最後發生效力的法令或條約爲凖。假若一外國政府和人民的條約利益。因此而受到損害。他們儘可用外交手段去求解决。美國的司法機關。無權可以干涉。美政府明知中國實力不够。大理院又肯爲之間接張膽。所以敢暢所欲爲。不過條約享受國際法保障。而一國大理院判例的權威。决不能有國際法的權威。何况美國大理院本身。亦曾明白承認。違背國際條約的内國法令。在對外方面。决不能有毁壞美國所負的國際條約義務的影響。可見我國忍受美國排華的移民律。完全是事實問題。而不是法律問題。就是美國人亦無從否認的。</p>
<p>一九○三年的中美商約早經滿期了。訂約交涉到現在還没有顯著的進展。（參觀作者「修改中美商約之關鍵」一文。見本年二月二日本報時許欄。）記得上海市商會和本埠華僑信託公司曾在中美改約聲中。呈請外部乘機交涉美國的移民苛例。我們亦認爲我國確有充分的理由可向美政府交涉。所以敢因最近的華僑「偷關」事件。再度喚起外交當局的注意。</p>

<h3>辛丑約並無明文規定英軍放棄長城外操演</h3>
<p>西門在下院之表示</p>
<p>［倫敦］今日下院開會時、工黨議員瓊司詢及本年六月二十六日山海關英軍司令官曾接當地日軍代表與滿當道之照會、謂英軍不應開入「滿洲國」境、英政府對於此事如何辦理、外相西門答稱、英政府已决議英軍放棄在長城外操練之習慣、一九○一年九月七日之和約中、並未明白准許此舉、英政府不欲引起法律問題之討論、故有此决議、長城之内儘可覓得適當操練之地、（衆大笑）西門末稱、渠無理由可信政府之决議將有更變、此種「禁止」亦施於其他各國之軍隊云、（四日路透電）</p>
<h3>僞禁英報事件</h3>

<h3>英美油公司對日行動一致</h3>
<p>專賣法未頒布前</p>
<p>擬商妥折衷辦法</p>
<p>［倫敦］油公司對於日本答覆英美關於「滿洲國」煤油專賣事所提抗議之文、具有希望、據謂專賣法尚未實在頒布、此事有商妥折衷辦法之可能、一方面保全「滿洲國」之顔面、一方面保全外國油公司之利益、及使滿洲油公司與大連煉油廠獲適當部分之營業云、諸油公司在此情勢中深信日本堅稱所議之專賣、乃「滿洲國」内政政策、而並不述及九國公約、實屬有意出此、以免引起複雜之外交爭論、而有嚴重之反動及於海軍談話會、油公司以爲今由駐滿英美領事在長春商妥折衷方法之途徑、業已開啟、至外間謡傳日人現圖離間英美一節、油公司均一笑置之、謂外國油公司現皆一致行動云、（六日路透電）</p>

<h3>日本設置軍備視委治地如禁臠</h3>
<p>國聯委會審查報告書</p>
<p>主席請開放袪除羣疑</p>
<p>［日内瓦］今晨國聯委託代管委員會開會討論日政府代管舊屬德國之太平洋諸島之報告書後、又作非公開會議兩小時之久、當時曾提出日本撥疑八十萬元建造船塢並飛行場問題、主席意代表齊沃杜里詢問外國飛機可否在此諸島降落、日代表伊藤對於此問、未作切實答覆、主席又稱、日本現禁外人游此諸島、或許游而嚴加監視、此種消息、言之鑿鑿、今欲終止之、其最佳方法、厥爲取銷一切禁令云、伊藤答稱、關於此事之許多消息、皆有用意、日當道因諸島地方不靖、故不得不施特别計劃、容亦有之、伊藤又稱、某時日海軍曾在此諸島附近會操、故不欲外人往游、至於某英教士被禁游視在其教務管轄權内之諸島等案、則渠將加以調查云、（五日中透電）</p>
<p>［日内瓦］日本對太平洋各島委任統治情形、已向國聯會提出常年報告、頃由聯會委任統治委員會加以審查、由日本代表駐華沙公使伊藤氏出席説明、緣最近各報載稱、日本對外國人及船舶往太平洋日本統治之各島港口者、多方留難、伊藤氏解釋此事、謂此種消息别有作用、不可輕信、至於其他某種特别情形、俟調查明白之後再行詳細説明、委員會主席謂太平洋委任日本統治之各島、世界各報對其内部情形紛紛批評、爲日本計、宜設法袪除世人之疑慮、平息謡言之法、莫妙於開放各島、聽任外國人自由出入云、委員會以日本所提常年報告書、内容尚有不充實之處、要求日本補充説明、（按所謂世界各報之批評、大約係指日本在太平洋委任統治各島内設置軍備而言）、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國深切注意</h3>
<p>暫時不願表示意見</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國聯代管委員會開會之際、有人以美國對日本代管大平洋舊德屬地之態度詢之國務院、國務院官員顧而言他、不願作直接答覆、僅謂此問題「非常專門」、須視國聯之解釋、故美國不願表示意見、到於日内瓦所傳、日本已將南太平洋兩代管島封閉、不准外人入港云云、國務次長亦不願置可否、（五日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本發表聲明</h3>
<p>禁止外籍輪航行</p>
<p>謂未違代管規程</p>
<p>［東京］五日國聯委托代管委員會指責日本在南洋代管島有違法行爲、外務省發言人今日特發表談話如下、日本政府遵守代管規程、並未違法、國聯代管委員會之指責毫無根據、外國人之登岸日本代管羣島嶼爲自由、曾未禁止、又關於外籍輪之航行、因該羣島爲政府指定航路、故祇許可日輪航行、此亦當無問題云、（六日華聯電）</p>
<h3>海軍談判陷於僵局英國努力斡旋</h3>
<p>西門分别與美日代表會談</p>
<p>日政府積極凖備廢約手續</p>
<p>［倫敦］英外相西門與美代表台維斯、今日午後在下院討論英美日海軍談話之僵局、此次討論、甚爲人所注意、因衆望西門當能籌得一種方案、使海軍談話繼續進行也、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］衆科海軍談話經英外交家之努力、可於今日復開、外相西門將邀日大使松平作非公開會談話、而提出賡續談話之方案、美代表團今日亦由西門方面聞得此項消息、英國大約將爲日本啟一門路、俾日本可如其大使齋藤近在華盛頓之所爲、而提出日本實欲分若干年造成海軍平等地位之建議、果爾、則美代表當樂於參加談話、惟美代表現表示彼等除坐聽而外、將無所爲、一般人士現覺談話不致歸於失敗、或長此僵擱、終必獲得一種妥恊、第此妥恊或爲無關重要者、</p>
<p>美代表團發言人今日延見路透訪員時、訪員詢以美日對於海軍比率之意見、是否有安妥恊之可能、談話是否有圓滿結局之希望、該發言人答曰、「有時無妥恊時、則必有妥恊、」其言模稜不可捉摸、衆料英國將步入缺口、以啟獲得結局之途徑、英國之意見、雖較近於日、但英國現切欲三國維持談話不使决裂、日本因堅持平等之主張、致無廻旋餘地、蓋爲國家尊嚴計、覺不能另易主張、及作退步也、</p>
<p>日代表松平態度較爲和緩、頗願提出稍寛之平等請求、但其本國海陸軍官員之抱有極端國家主義者、視其人過於温和、將不許其過於偏重外交友誼、松平手腕既不能自由、乃屬望英國設法斡旋、俾制定一種方案、載有日方較爲和緩之要求、而又爲英美兩國所接受、同時松平並警告其政府、勿遽宣布華盛頓海軍公約之廢止、維廢止之舉、年内終必行之、但暫時不致在倫敦公布、在此炸彈擲落前、各方仍將竭力設法使倫敦談話繼續進行、查華盛海軍公約規定在廢止一年内、必須召集各海權國之大會、届時華盛頓與倫敦海軍始告期滿、大會地點非在倫敦、即在華盛頓、大約以倫敦較爲適宜、其時間則爲明年夏季、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>［東京］廢除華盛頓條約問題、業於二十九日通過海軍軍事參議官會議、三十一日通過元帥會議、現在祇有樞密院之批准手續、確定將於本月底或下月上旬宣佈廢除、（六日日聯電）</p>

<p>海牙　荷蘭經濟部代表史左傑最近自巴達維亞歸來、對於日本在太平洋尤其在荷蘭屬地擴充政治與經濟勢力抨擊甚力、史氏係代表荷蘭與日本進行商務談判、史氏聲稱、荷屬東印度已預備五十四種日本貨之進口分配限制並謂吾人必須排擠日本人、無論日人願意與否、必須接受吾人之分配額也、荷屬東印度之日本人百分之百在鞏固其勢力範圍、日本之目的在操縱東印度之商業、日本人不能使商業脱離政治、故自視爲東方之統治者、此種觀念可於其在東印度之行爲見之、日荷商業談判之成敗、將視日本願購東印度物産之多寡而定、所有巴達維亞之堆棧無不滿諸日本貨、余個人深疑荷人與日人能否妥恊也、但余並不否認價廉之日本貨在東印度自有其地位云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>巴達維亞　日代表越田與荷印代表海德連五日下午六時會見、討論報告書問題、然兩方意見未能一致、日代表團因想打開難關、請訓本國政府决定、同時預想最惡情形之時、極秘密凖備回國、（五日聯電）</p>

<p>［日内瓦］軍縮會議主席漢德森爲修改軍縮會議工作程序、曾以公文分送主席團各國代表、現國聯會秘書廳已將此項公文予以公布、其内容略謂本年六月初旬軍縮會議通過英法美三國折衷案時、曾决定繼續談判、以期成立一般軍縮公約、此項談判原由法國前外長巴爾都以忠實態度熱心担任、乃馬賽刺案發生、巴氏慘遭毒手、致此種談判爲之延擱、形勢如此、特建議將軍縮問題、成立一般軍縮公約之談判、延至一九三五年春間、始行結束、至目下業已考慮成熟各點、不妨提前成立議定書云、所謂業已考慮成熟各點、即（一）軍器之取締及製造、（二）軍事預算之公開、（三）組織軍縮常設委員會、此外本年六月軍縮會議决議案所主張之取締國設航空一層、至今尚未開始研究、此層尤覺不可忽視、應請從速予以審查、現主席團定於十一月二十日開會、届時應請各委員表示意見、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>英政府表示滿意</p>
<p>［倫敦］英下院今日討論薩爾緊張局勢時、外相西門答覆反對黨領袖藍斯堡之問話稱、負薩爾保安之責者、乃爲薩爾管理委員會、薩爾公民投票、已定明年一月十三日舉行、此種維持治安之責任、仍將由該會担負、至於薩爾委員會自覺無力維持治安之局勢、不應使之發生、渠信亦决不致發生、薩爾委員會曾遠在一九二六年向國聯行政院聲明、遇絶對必要時、委員會有權召集邊境及附近之軍隊恊同維持治安、國聯行政院當將此文紀錄之、法國在薩爾西境外之任何軍事行動、純爲戒備性質、苟非管理委員會不能盡責、而被迫請助、則調用外軍維持治安、實不成問題、至於借用英兵事、更未提及、</p>

<p>濟南通信、魯省齊東爲産棉區域、本年建設廳在該縣推行脱字第三十六號改良棉種、辦理棉業運銷合作社、棉業益形發達、農民種棉者益多、緣種棉土篔、以沙質壤土爲最相宜、魯境沿黄河一帶、土質多係沙質壤土、與美國著名産棉之米西比河尼若河之下游頗相似、故亦宜於種棉、而以齊東尤桂、惜歷年棉種、沿用舊種舊法、不知改良、棉質日衰、民國十一二年、始有美國金氏棉種運魯、散佈　間、棉農呼之爲本地洋棉、十六年、齊東成立第二棉業試騐場、楊少雲爲主任、與技師胡長凖共同研究培育改良棉種、十七年、楊少雲死、胡長凖繼其事、搜集各種棉種、一再試騐裁培、至二十一年、始育成品質最佳之脱字三十六號改良姜棉、初在本場繁殖種子、至二十二年得種四千斤、一部份分於鄒平鄉村建設研究院、一部份在齊東分散於棉農試種、預計可得改良棉種四十萬斤、足供今年全縣種棉之用、及新棉上市、所産之棉、多被軋花販購去、棉場收得種子僅七八萬斤、致不敷本縣棉農之用、遂以育成之四十號四十七號、又育出之卅六號之二補充之、今年共下種二十萬斤、建設廳爲防止棉種之失散、於齊東組織美棉運銷合作社、並負責技術上之指導、籌劃運消辦法、辦理貸款、救濟棉農之經濟、同時由中棉歷記、在齊東設立大規模之軋化廠、合作社員所産之棉、全集於軋花廠、軋花廠軋出種子、再售於棉廠、以免種子散失或錯亂、自今春二月由建設廳技士陳士燦赴齊東着手組織合作社、四月組織完成、共成立一百五十三社、社員四千八百餘户、有棉田三萬三千畝、合作社組織成立後、政府僅處於指導地位、教以新的技術、輔助推銷、其社内事務及規約等、均由社員自定、至要者、爲不得社内之同意、不得更換種子、貸款與銷售、由合作社整個辦理、社員不得單獨售於某廠、或向某方貸欵、建設廳辦理合作社之意、除於技術上·運銷上·經濟上·加以帮助及保存種子外、尚有一重在意義、蓋以外國各種事業、皆有相當組織、一切行政管理及改良推廣等、易於辦理、我國素無此種組織、管理不易、故組織合作社、一切推廣計劃、容易着手、今年美棉之情形、因最初天旱、後又多雨、棉花頗受影響、收成只佔往年百分之七十、不惟中國如此、全世界均如此、然産量已甚可觀、每畝最高産額達三百斤以上、平均以二百斤計算、可收棉七百萬斤、現齊東軋花廠、以每百斤十二元七角之價目收買、共值約九十萬元、一年産棉值九十萬元、不可謂少、而農間經濟、亦得以調劑矣、至每畝之收入、約在二十五元以上、較種糧食增收八元以上、今年棉田三萬三千畝、較去年增加一萬五千畝、此一萬五千畝地、較去年增收十二萬元、原日種棉之一萬八千畝地、今年改用改良棉種、每畝增收三元、共增收五萬四千元、統計新舊棉户、今年可增收十七八萬元、預計來年種棉者愈多、産量愈增、今年所産棉種計三十六號者五十萬斤、四十七號者七十萬斤、三十六號之二者四萬斤、四十號者五萬斤、共一百二十九萬斤、省府已撥出專欵三萬二千元收買此項棉種、以每斤二分計算、可收買十六萬斤、預備來年向劃爲合作推廣區之十二縣推廣、齊東全縣、將專用脱字三十六號一種、其他者將分散於章邱·青城·高苑·博興·蒲台·濱縣·惠民·高唐·夏津·臨清·邱縣十一縣、今年旱澇不均、致歉收百分之三十、爲千不逢一之現象、明年亦照此數計算、此一百三十萬斤改良棉種、可得棉五千六百萬斤、其不用改良種者、尚不在此數也、棉之性情、於下種時及生長時、均喜水、開花後則忌雨、魯省氣候、四五月雨水多、八九月則否、故於種棉極合適、惟今年改常、四五月間甚旱、九月則雨水甚多、故棉花甚受影響、收棉時間亦因之遲延一個月、故種棉最好引水灌溉、不靠天雨、可由人操縱、虹吸管引水灌田之成功、將來用之於棉業、可收極大效力、且青紗帳期、土匪蜂起、治安最受影響、將來種棉者多、種高糧者少、産棉區内、治安可連帶易於維持、亦棉業發逹之副益也、</p>
<h3>西北視察記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>嘉峪關外之石油與煤</p>
<p>酒泉鑛産、有金有煤有石棉、（狀如絲、有彈力、色白、或灰或綠、質軟如綿、織成之布、火不能燒、名火浣布、）惟金鑛及石棉、無有繼續開者、煤鑛儲量甚大、民間以需要燃料、尚任意開掘、産地在祁連山北麓·大紅溝·小紅溝·東溝樑·大黄溝·及冰溝一帶、中以大黄溝之煤質爲最佳、其餘大小紅溝等處、燃時臭味四溢、以含硫磺過多也、各地每日産量、約二千餘斤、冬日農閒挖者較多、産量亦增、産地煤價、每斗約重三十五斤、售錢約一百八十文、即銅元十八枚、牛車駱載、運至縣城、途程約一百二十里、（大黄溝較遠四十里）亦祇售五六百文、若交通便利、尚可運銷他縣、</p>
<p>二日下午一時、由酒泉啟行、西門不開、出北門、轉向西北、旋過討來河、河水泛濫、草地沮洳、車行頗困、既登乾砂、顛簸雖大、但路甚坦直、憑眺近郊、徧生「海柏柏」草、葉形如柏、質肥如莧、富有鹽味、爲飼料上品、左顧雪山、依天則玉簡璘珣、映日則瓊光璀璨、洵奇景也、未幾、車抵嘉峪關、已行六十里、東南距蘭州、爲一千五百二十里、北依黑山嘉峪、南憑紅山祁連、關城居中、險峻天成、惟居民稀少、雖中俄條約曾闢南埠、而商務重心仍在酒泉、且關城土築、邊牆傾圯、山有間道、可搗後方、以與負山帶海之山海關相較、不無遜色、碑題「天下雄關」、似覺過當、且近代火器發明、戰爭進爲立體、藉使雄壯果如「天下第一關、」然守兵不力、所謂地利不如人和、尚不免爲帝國主義者鐵蹄所蹂躪焉、過關爲一戈壁、勢若斜下、彌望細石舖地成青、回憶蘭州西上、至關殆爲一魚脊高點、南北山脈、合而復展、極兜風向、俗有「嘉峪關打雷、兩會飛落漢中」之語、即可見此間氣候之變幻、風勢之迅烈矣、</p>
<p>關西四十里、曰雙井堡、渺無人烟、傳昔居民繁多、咸以淘金爲業、觀其堡壘院落之遺跡、亦頗近似、再四十餘里、抵惠回堡而宿、是日行程、俗稱一百六十里、實則僅三十七公里、約合一百一十里也、堡屬玉門縣、居民三十餘家、多爲口内人、雖有宿店、但無食鋪、西去人烟尤稀、中途無尖處、須酌帶乾糧、按站趕行、庶免露宿荒漠、近堡田地、因得白揚河之灌溉、凡種糜麥罌粟、收成均佳、河水清冽、入冬不冰、邊際古柳參天、野草婆娑、生地荒野、人自選耕、亦關外之一小佳境也、</p>
<p>翌晨（三日）出發、初經黑石戈壁、起伏若波狀、且多裂阱、俗呼「九溝十八坡、三步上來兩步梭、」蓋亦寫實之語也、繼見豐美水草二三處、殊宜遊牧、約六十里、至赤金湖、昔爲腰站、今亦廢垣頽牆而已、十八里至赤金㙈、居民五六家、出㙈有歧道、詢人皆逃避不答、突見跑郵政者至、始知左走赤金堡、右爲玉門大路、前行數里、經一小軟沙灘、左望村樹茂密、綠野如茵、是即唐玉門故址、今之赤金堡也、</p>
<p>赤金堡東南九十里、祁連山北麓、有一河焉、盛産石油、天然湧現於地面、清同治年間、堡民入山採金、往來過之、遂被發現、試燃以火、烈熖熊熊、因名其地曰石油泉、並名其河曰石油河、挖坑勺取、相沿迄今、該堡都司營、年抽油捐二千斤、民國十七年、都司裁撤、改由酒泉城防軍收捐、油區面積、約十餘方里、冬春盛雪不消、油亦凝結不流、夏日水漲、油始湧出、採油鄉民勺取納入桶内、負運上岸、再由油商（現有三家）用大車運銷各處、以供村民燃點、或塗大車輪軸、銷路有限、可以測知至其油質、民初曾經某比人及某德人先後携至上海化騐、認爲成分極佳、後請開採、省署未准、十八年春、甘省府及派專家張人鑑前往調查、並經携蘭化騐、計含　油百分之一六·五○、煤油百分之七○·○○、此外石油河東約四十里、惠回堡南八十里、白揚河村南四十里之石油溝地方、面積方六七里、亦産石油、成分與石油泉者大似、</p>
<p>汽油係揮發油、爲油中之最有價值者、普通石油、所含汽油成分、若達百分之十以上、即爲上等油礦、汽油用途、極關重要、現代文明國家、莫不以汽油爲推動機件之原力、甚有以石油産量蓄量之豐嗇、以爲國家强富估計之標凖者、即以我國開發西北交通論、舉凡空中飛機、陸上汽車、無不需用大量之汽油、歐亞航空、甘新汽車、在肅（酒泉）所儲用之汽油、皆爲津滬運來之外貨、每箱價達七十元左右、高貴津滬七八倍、然此尚僅就運費而言、至運時久經摇動、破裂揮發、約占四分之一之巨大損失、尚未計及、如此舍已求人、不惜利權外溢、貨棄於地、詎不可痛、而今開發西北、由理論進爲事實、陝西開採油礦、亦已卓著成效、此一大好富源、似難再任廢置也、</p>
<p>石油泉西五十里之紅溝、北一百二十里之北窰、玉門縣城南一百五十里之昌馬、均産巨量之煤礦、昌馬以北之照壁山、産綠色銅鑛、俗稱孔雀石、中含微量銅質、若深加探採、亦必有鉅量之銅鑛發現、至於金鑛、沿南山北麓、無論已淘未淘者、更所在多有也、</p>

<p>本埠中國實業銀行、厦門方面、亦有紙幣流通、該行爲充實現金凖備起見、於十月二十九日、商准招商局、代運現洋三十萬元往厦門、每箱裝洋五千元、計裝六十箱、自金利源碼頭上船、其他去貨、以荳餅爲最多、約有一萬數千件、麥粉亦有六七千袋、餘爲疋頭香烟等項、該局以裝有鉅欵、爲慎重起見、不搭旅客、故自滬至厦、途中甚爲平安、本月二日抵厦、即將該欵交缷、並起清客貨、開赴汕頭、</p>
<p>海盗誤會</p>
<p>嘉禾既抵汕頭、於四號裝齊客貨、即向北開駛來滬、但大鵬灣海盗、國内重要口岸、均派有羽黨、專事刺探輪船行程、有無貴重物品、以便行刦、此次嘉禾由滬運欵入厦、誤認爲由汕至厦或上海、故有海盗十二名、於四月僑裝搭客、混入船内、乘機搶劫、查嘉禾船齡已四十一年、且非正班客輪、故未裝置鐵栅、僅派護航隊六名、各給武器、隨輪保衛、</p>
<p>汕面行刦</p>
<p>四日晨七時、嘉禾由汕頭開出、船内僅有統艙客數十人、九時一刻、船抵大汕面角海面Tai　Sarni　　Point、距汕頭不過五十餘華里、在輪海盗、開始發動行刦、先由匪首鳴槍一響、其餘十一盗、一得信號、即同時響應、首將船主沙增嘉·及無綫電管理員陳國雄監視、後將大二副等各船員、驅禁一室、威逼船主、改易方面、從海陸豐方面駛去、此時全船均受盗匪控制、船員已失抵抗力、祇得聽其所爲、</p>
<p>航警被殺</p>
<p>船内航警、聞得槍聲、知爲盗刦、即羣謀抵抗、但海盗上船時、早已注意及此、故一經發動、先發制人、不待航警出槍、海盗即先轟擊、當場有一航警、爲匪開槍擊斃、倒臥船内、有一航警、亦遭海盗槍傷、其他各航警不敢再動、即被繳械、連船主室内自衛武器、亦被繳去、</p>
<p>搜刦情形</p>
<p>海盗目的、在三十萬元、故行刦時、先將船上業務主任沈欽祥·及賑房李少炳·等三人扣住、責令交出欵項、沈等除將賑房内所存現欵、供匪刦取外、别無巨金可繳、匪猶不信、勒令繳出大艙鎖匙、開示貨艙、經匪詳細搜檢、確無巨額現銀、至是方悉上海裝運三十萬元、已缷於厦門矣、匪乃表示失望、統計海盗在輪搜刦、自四日晨九時起、至五日上午六時方止、共歷二十二小時之久、</p>
<p>綁架船員</p>
<p>五日晨、船於海盗控制下、向海陸豐東面紅海灣開行、沿途由匪扣得漁船一艘、備供携賊圖逃之用、及至紅海灣、匪衆下漁船而去、臨行以所刦無幾、乃將船上業務主任沈欽祥·賑房李少炳·另一理貨員·共三人、一併架去、及匪衆離輪後、船主沙增嘉、始解放被禁諸人、整理引擎、由紅海灣退出、駛往厦門、</p>
<p>電滬報告</p>
<p>船上無綫電機、已爲海盗損壞、致匪去時、不能即時電告、直至昨晨七時、滬局始得沙增嘉電報、略謂、本輪於四日晨七時、從汕頭開出、至九時許、船到汕面、被海盗十二人刦掠、船上護航隊被匪槍殺一人、擊傷一人、匪强迫本輪、往海陸豐東之紅海灣、臨行時、綁架業務主任一名、理貨員兩人、今船已向厦門開行等語、電文甚簡、並未述及損失數目、</p>
<p>家屬探詢</p>
<p>滬上各船員家屬、閲報得悉此事、即於昨日上午十時許、粉往總局、探詢眞相、最着急者、爲業務主任沈欽祥·賑房李少炳·與理貨員等家　、均欲叩問被架者之姓名、但該局所知者、除沈李二人外、猶未甚詳悉、祇得用善言安慰、允爲電查、始各散去、</p>
<p>請緝海盗</p>
<p>該局得報、昨日劉鴻生電呈南京交通部朱部長、請轉咨海軍部、及電閩粵兩省當局、速派軍警、分頭恊緝、營救被架三船員、該局並直接電請厦門海軍營局、與粵海軍、請予派艦兜緝、或可截獲、一面又電厦門、令嘉禾輪迅即開還上海、昨聞香港英驅逐艦維夏特號、已駛赴汕面及紅海灣、恊助追匪矣、</p>
<p>明日可到</p>
<p>嘉禾輪當匪去後、先往汕頭、發一電報來滬、便即離汕赴厦、船上無綫電、現正由陳國雄沿途修理、昨日午後、滬局得到厦門發來有綫電報一通、言嘉禾已安抵厦門、略裝貨件、便即開回上海、預計該輪於八日下午三時、或可安抵上海矣、一切損失、須待船到、方可明悉、至於被匪殺傷航警、船到厦門後、即將死者安殮、傷者送厦門醫院療治、聞局方將予以相當撫卹、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　杯水見難求寒工護老萬金談可致猾吏聯羣</p>
<p>這老人手上還揑了那隻碗呢，躊躇要抬起手來搔頭，不覺把碗舉到他頭上去了。自己感覺到立刻放下手來時，志前也看到，不由得笑了起來。老工人在那打着許多皺紋的尖削臉上，也透出一層紅暈來。就向後退了兩步，這時，張介夫李士廉二人，站在廊沿下談話。他們看到志前一個人到後面工廠子裏去了，心裏就想着，瓦匠作工，那有什麽好看，他必定是追着這女孩子去接洽去了，且看他是怎樣的進行？因之這兩個人不時的走到廊檐下來。現在看到這樣一個没鬍子的老年人，在房門口不進不出，情形更是可疑，於是二人索性釘住在廊檐下不走。志前在裏面只管呌道：老嘆，你進來，我還能騙你嗎？老人聽人家説了個騙字，這倒好像是自己疑心人家的好意了，這可使不得，於是就笑着走進來了。志前將桌上的茶壺提起來，向他就點了兩點頭。那老工人，眞有些受寵若驚，兩手捧了瓦碗！就來接着。志前向裏面斟時，他口裏連説承當不起。志前斟了大半碗，他捧着，猶如猴子盤桃一般、兩手捧了那碗，將嘴就着，昂起脖子來，骨都骨都，只管喝下去，將那碗茶一口氣喝乾，還拖長着聲音，唉了一下，表示那非常贊美的意味。在這桌上，還有半碟餅乾，是志前吃剩下的。他想着，呌人來光喝一碗茶、也不成敬意，於是把那半碟餅乾、端了起來，向他笑道：你拿去嘗嘗罷。老人退着説了兩聲不敢當，半伸着手，將三個指頭，拑了一片餅乾，放在門牙中間，咬了一點點，這就拱手帶點頭道：就是這樣，就是這樣。（五八）</p>
<h3>當你没有錢的時候</h3>
<p>— 紫羔</p>
<p>當你没有錢的時候，那麽，你定能發現錢的魔力的神妙：</p>
<p>當然，你還能記得在有錢做面團團富家翁的時候的情景，住的是洋房，吃的是魚肉，穿的是綢緞，走路還用汽車代步，夏天跑到莫干山去避暑，冷天躲進裝着熱水汀的房間裏，陪着你太太飲酒賞雪，閑來無事打牌作樂，聽聽無綫電，看看大京戲，回力球，跑狗場，影戲場，夜總會……還有一般非親非戚的人們，都會迎着笑臉來奉承你，祇要你開口，什麽都可辦到，大老官有的是「錢」。可是，一旦碰到了惡劣的命運後，直閙到家破人亡，你獨個兒東飄西蕩的時候，你就會體味着許多没有錢的苦楚。衣食不周，棲身無地，夏天還可在水門汀上睡上一夜，冷天祇有在弄堂角垃圾堆旁打抖，無綫電在街上可聽，這也算是苦中得樂了。但是，跳舞場，回力球……那些消金窟却再也休想踏進。那時，就是一般非親非戚的無用招喚就會迎着笑臉來奉承你的人們，也會像陌路人一般的給副鐵板面孔你看。説不定更要駡你幾句「貧居閙市無人問，富在深山有遠親」。這二句你也會不疑深信了。祝枝山曾有一聯云「富若游龍，走遍五山四海；窮似餘虎，嚇退九親六眷」。没有錢的苦，形容得也够了。</p>
<p>是的，没有錢的時候，你是會感到這許多苦楚的，就是在馬路上走路，你也會感到拘束異常的，脚上像帶着鐵鏈般地使你走不開，可是，也似乎像一匹溜了韁的馬般四足會騰守起來。想奔過去。但，你也曾想到有錢的時候的情景嗎！</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<h3>（寒玉）</h3>
<p>路過浙江路，看見一個鋪子裏裝着活的廣告：一個人穿了白色的衣服，戴上面具和高帽子，手中握着大摺扇，在宣傳商品。這當然是個新奇的演出。在馬路的那邊，有對外國的老夫婦，也目不轉睛的看着。不知他們對於這個活無常，作什麽感想？</p>
<h3>兩位苦學的女工</h3>
<p>— 葉期百</p>
<p>這半年，除了白天擔任許多功課以外，在晚上，更主持了一所民衆夜校。夜校中，收授的，都是許多女生；而這許多女生，又多半是白天在工廠裏做工的。</p>
<p>我覺得，伊們那種好學的精神，實在是可驚；所以，伊們絡續的，來報名入校，我也來者不拒的，收了已有一百開外。</p>
<p>有一天，課還没有上，而我的工作，又是都預備好了；因此，順便的在教室裏望望。望的當兒，剛好有兩個學生，問我生字；這兩個學生，乃是一對姊妹；我教懂了伊們，便和伊們隨便的閒談起來。我説：「你們白天出去做工嗎」？「做的」。「兩個人在一起嗎」？「是的」。我又問：「那末，你們是在什麽工廠的」？「是南洋烟草公司」。「這樣，是很不便呢」！「是的，早上，從浦東的家裏去；晚上，從廠裏回來」。「吃飯呢」？我再問下去。「是隨便買一點來吃」。「那末，早上幾點鐘去？晚上幾點鐘回來呢」？「早上五點鐘，就起身啦，揩了面，就渡江到廠裏去；一直到下午四五時，才回來」。「這樣，到家是很遲了，時間是很怱促的」。我説。「是的，到了家，拿了書，就跑來上六點半的夜課啦」！「夜飯呢」？「夜校退了課，才回去吃的」。「哦！這樣，是很苦啊」！伊們没有話了。一聲不響的，呆望着地。</p>
<p>後來，我從别的學生處，知道他們家境的苦况，知道伊們家裏，是有一個老祖母，一個殘廢的母親，爸爸是早死去了，兩個老人家的生活，靠着這兩個女孩子的四隻手。</p>
<h3>鹿死誰手</h3>
<p>— 漫无</p>
<h3>祈禱</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>莊嚴的禮拜堂擠滿了密密的信徒，男女老幼夾雜地坐着，靜穆得幾乎可以使每個人都能够聽到自己脈搏的跳動；可是在前排左角，坐的却完全是少女和比較年長的修道女，不久，我便知道那是特設的唱詩班。</p>
<p>唱詩班作爲主力地唱着，許多信徒們附和着，聲調是那樣的和諧，態度是那樣的嚴肅，就連那鋼琴也並未破壞和諧的統一性。鋼琴眞是奇怪的東西呢，它可以被人彈奏着唱毛毛雨，桃花江，但也可以伴唱着這神聖的讚美詩！—鋼琴的本身是没有罪惡的，罪惡祇在利用它的身上。</p>
<p>「耶穌愛我，我愛耶穌！」禮拜堂裏在緊張地而又整齊地唱着，門外的頑童却怪聲地搗亂起來了：「耶穌愛我，我不愛耶蘇穌！」牧師的助手走出來驅散，莊嚴的禮拜堂地由此而失墜了幾分莊嚴的意味！</p>
<p>再後，是牧師的講道，天父如何，基督如何，總之大家要敬仰天父，敬仰基督，單是敬仰還不算，更得相信他，服從他，聽信他一切的話。基督是隨時隨地都在我們身邊的，所以我們做事處處要留心，企圖謊騙是不可能的。……</p>
<p>最後：全場一致的祈禱，各人默誦着各人的祈禱詞。</p>
<p>短篇小説</p>
<h3>媒</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在維的友人中，萍是常常勸他早點結婚的；原因是萍有一個快樂的家庭，所以伊也希望伊的朋友能有一個快樂的家庭。</p>
<p>一天，萍到維的寓所裏去找維，又談到這一椿事：</p>
<p>「維，我來給你做媒吧，這是我的一個表妹，年齡比你小兩三歲，在學校裏也受過相當的教育。」萍很高興的説。</p>
<p>「謝謝您的好意，我現在要把全部的精神用在事業上面，所以我是不願意結……」維還没有説完，萍便把他的話頭打斷：</p>
<p>「我知道了，你是没有見過本人，你不知道伊的面貌體態究竟怎樣，所以你不願意；我明天晚上把伊帶到俱樂部去給你看吧。我决不是舊式的媒妁，教人在布袋裏買貓，説是白貓，買到手却是黑貓！」萍説着也没有得到維的同意，便笑嘻嘻地走了。</p>
<p>第二天晚上，維在俱樂部裏游戲，萍果然帶來了一個女郎，走進門便向他介紹：</p>
<p>「這是我的表妹。」萍説着又指維向伊同來的女郎説：</p>
<p>「這位就是維君。」</p>
<p>維請伊們隨便坐坐，他陪着伊們談了一會，伊們便起身告辭。</p>
<p>「維，我現在要送表妹回家去，我們過一天再見吧。」萍説。</p>
<p>維也没有留伊們，便送伊們到門口，招呼伊們登車歸去。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>過了幾天，維又在俱樂部裏遇見萍了；這次萍的表妹却没有偕來。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣？你看了可滿意。」萍問維。</p>
<p>「甚麽事？」</p>
<p>「我給你做媒的事！」萍嬌嗔的説。</p>
<p>「呵呵……我不是早向你説過，我現在要努力我的事業，我不願意結婚媽。」維的態度很莊嚴。</p>
<p>「眞的你不要結婚嗎？那你不要感覺到寂寞嗎！」</p>
<p>「專心於一種事業，是可打退寂寞這魔障的。」</p>
<p>「其實已經結婚的人，又何嘗不感覺到寂寞呢！」萍的論調又轉變了，伊説着又談到别的事情上去了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>隔開了很久的時候，某次維和萍晤面，在無意中維問起萍表妹的消息；他才知道萍的表妹已出嫁了，伊嫁給一個闊人，有汽車，洋房，……伊是因爲他能滿足伊物質上的要求才嫁給他的；並且萍説當初伊向伊表妹談起維的境况時，伊就不大滿意，雖然伊還説維是一個有爲的青年，但伊終於嫁給一個比伊年長兩倍的富翁了。</p>
<p>從這事件上，維發生的感想是：「這年頭，最有效的媒介，還是要讓金錢！」</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>伊的眼力原不曾隨着伊的年齡而起過什麽變化，此刻伊又是特别的注意，所以我想伊必然把這裏所有的景物，在頃刻間已一覽無遺了！但伊站了半響，兀是不動，彷彿是這些含有歷史意味的景物，已像山海關一般的打動了伊思潮了。我們這許多人還是戰戰兢兢地俯伏着，連呼吸也是格外的小心，以免因此驚動伊。這幅一人肅立，百人拜伏的呆照，足足維持了十分鐘之久。後來伊就慢慢地移動了伊的脚步，但走不到五六步，便又停止了；大概是伊打算要瞧瞧另外一隅的景象，站在原處不便，所以要換一個地方，可以瞧得更清楚些。</p>
<p>全部跪着的人，依舊像泥塑木彫似的一動也不動，一堆堆的顔色，像插在花瓶裏的花一樣地靜止着：因爲在太后不曾親口宣諭，允許我們站起來之前，無論什麽人，就是光緒，也不敢擅自動一動的。而聲音是更没有了。這時候，只有太后一個人用一種極度矜持而細小的步子，在殿上徐徐徘徊着。伊的態度，在外表上似乎永遠是十分鎮靜的：但依我的猜測，伊這時候的趦趄不前，實在是内心上很慌亂的表現。伊自己也許想就此找一個地方趕快去歇息歇息，也許又想領着衆人先往各處去察看察看，也許又想………總之，伊的心思必然很紊亂，一時不知道該怎樣做才好，所以只得暫時在殿上徘徊一會了！</p>
<p>這幾天工夫裏，伊老是在火車上，後來又給鸞輿槓抬着，可説是全部的生活，全在動的狀態中；這時候，重復到了靜止的宫殿裏，伊自不免要覺得有些異樣了！（一六八）</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>近期紗收貨説頻傳</p>
<p>紗市晨跌午漲、收盤形勢頗挺、因邇來現紗走銷尚稱不惡、上海存紗有减至八九萬包光景、而某公司在近月把持收貨、空氣濃厚、所以多頭心理傾向做多、市盤一昂、漲勢愈烈、惟日商有一部份空額、始終不補、</p>
<p>金鷄後市突漲</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉　跌、場中人氣渙散、且甯波帮和豐紗廠套出樣紗二三千包、以致市價略挫、各月跌六·八·九角、午後開盤市况突然轉緊、因金價上午收盤漲至千元左右、另有一説、通成公司在本月份限價一百八十元買進之説、市盤則愈拍愈硬、結果各月均漲一元一·三·四·九角、全日成交統計二萬九千三百包、查賣出穗隆一千四百五十包、吉豐五百五十包、通記五百包、同豐六百包、恒德二千八百包、潤康一千三百五十包、德記四百包、新昌七百包、源大一千三百五十包、錦昌一千零五十包、賡豐一千三百五十包、買進潤康六百五十包、大豐四百包、達記一千一百包、賡豐九百五十包、遠大七百包、元一六百五十包、泰昌三千一百五十包、恒昌五百五十包、長豐五百包、慎記一千零五十包、仁豐八百包、同和六百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>現紗銷路尚好、查全日各帮買去統計一千包、行情晨疲午堅、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>棉花午後漲風突起</p>
<p>棉市晨平午漲、收盤時漲風愈熾、因紗市良好、同時現棉銷路益覺活動、上午金價又高出一千元關外、於是散空抵補、市價步拍步緊、據市場上傳説、甬和豐紗廠購買標花有二萬擔左右云、</p>
<p>鄭標好四五角</p>
<p>標棉前市開盤、因美印棉市均疲弱、故場中市情尚屬平淡、惟甯波紗廠購買、結果各月跌五分至一角、午後開盤因紗市回漲、金價收盤漲至千元光景、市氣突然緊俏、同時現棉交易益覺活動、致買氣愈旺、担至三收盤漲風更熾、各月均漲四五角、全日成交統計七萬二千二百擔、查賣出梅記一千二百擔、瑞大一千四百擔、慎記一千六百擔、新亨一千二百担、源大四千二百擔、賡豐二千四百擔、慎昌一千擔、鴻昌一千一百擔、恒德五千擔、同興一千六百擔、益昶一千五百擔、信誠一千八百擔、買進大字三千二百擔、仁豐三千八百擔、潤康一萬零七百擔、長豐一千八百擔、大豐二千九百擔、恊成一千六百担、益豐一千五百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉廠胃開展</p>
<p>現棉銷場稍形發展、各廠辦胃漸開、來源計姚花三百八十六包、通花九百七十五包云、</p>
<p>津市紗花背道而馳</p>
<p>津訊、棉紗市况頗形穩固、客帮生意尚健、津廠紗香河帮買松鶴紗十五包、價一百四十八元、又十支三光紗十五包、價一百四十六元、（統税在外）、又買十六支八馬紗二十包、一百七十五元五角、保府帮買十六支三喜紗十包、價爲一百八十一元五角、高陽帮買二十支八馬紗二十包、一百八十二元五角、（以上之價統税在内）、</p>
<p>又河西花趨勢仍不堅穩、西洋商略有做開、克達行買進二百包、開價三十五元五角、其他洋商買進一百包、價爲三十五元、</p>
<p>美棉僅多掉期交易</p>
<p>紐約棉市平靜無色、所有交易大抵爲近遠期掉期性質、開盤時因利物浦電訊低落、浮多了結、價格下跌四五磅音、但南方毫無抛出、故市况尚屬穩定、套賣亦少、當場内略有購買之時、市况即稍呈起色、明日（六日）將發表之收成估計、各方均漠然置之、但據各種重要私人估計之平均數、截至五日止、計九百五十一萬包、交易者目下正在造候華府對於明年耕種田畝計劃之發展、聞政府已得一兩全方法、俾外人可以購買美棉、故人氣極佳、近收盤時國外方面抛出、價格略低、收盤穩定、紐約棉花交易社報告、九月份全世界各種棉花之總消耗額、爲一百八十七萬九千包、去年同月則爲二百零四萬三千包、計現貨跌五等音、期貨跌四至八磅音、英棉期貨跌六七點、印棉因場中操業者買進而堅、計平果爾不動、奧姆辣漲一·二五羅比、白羅溪漲一羅比、原電錄左、（五日電）</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>洋麥並無兜售舉動粉麥得以繼續上漲</p>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈先漲後平、繼則又漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近小八分、遠好二角左右、坎拿大小八分零、當開價後、以洋麥上落無幾、人心本平、惟業外多買、則以米價步俏、内地人心、已爲帶起、因此買胃甚健、各月份即暗升二分左右、旋則廠方略出、人心又懈、較開價亦回落一二分不等、迨至下午開盤、因洋麥無兜售消息、各廠方面、意見未能一致、業外之空頭、急遽暢補、銀錢業聞又有少數購買、致市氣復振、開價步漲、後步如廠抛不旺、恐尚有繼好之勢、結果本月份較好二分二釐半、十二月好二分半、一二月份好三分二釐半、三月份好三分半、四月份好三分七釐半、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份呈停寂之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近小八分、遠好二角、坎拿大小八分零、當開價時、以洋麥之變動甚少、授受雙方、一致觀望、是以交易清淡、開價無多、迨至下午開盤、因粉市良好、市面之抛户、又甚稀少、故各月份喊價、均提高三五分不等、此後市面、當看粉市如何爲轉移也、結果本月份較好五分、十二月份好六分、一月份好五分、二月份好四分、三月份好二分、現麥市况、因紛市轉俏、高貨見俏三五分、開宿州徐州山東麥三元八角七分、瑶灣海州麥三元八角二分、南京麥三元七角九分、計九千包、由福新阜豐等廠辦去、</p>
<p>支加哥雜糧市况暗淡、市價則因空方在假期前、從事抵捕、故略好起、小麥與玉米倉庫現貨供給减少、一般於是重行購買、小麥市内多頭方面、皆以十二月份掉作五月份、故二者之差額逐漸减小、阿根廷報告天氣不良、取銷限制、西南旱區在前週有已得甘霖之説、加拿大則採取限制、此間（芝加哥）市面乃呈躊躇、衆仍信目下價格、恐難上漲、</p>
<p>河下米漲而復跌</p>

<p>回籠期米開一千五百噸</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、繼續活潑、現洋米仍以本街爲主、現貨漲起一角、期貨亦漲角許、惟市價漲、進户不及日前之　、而内地帮對於洋米進胃反以價昂觀望、故市面乃見漲而呆之局勢矣、五市開現西貢二千包暹暹香港等碎米二千五百五十包、期洋米洋行抛賣停手、市上回籠貨甚活、全市開出一千五百噸、十一月份大至五元一角八分、三月份自五元四角至五元四角六分、統係本街上進出也、客秈内地仍貪、惟來源亦漸活潑、昨日漲起一角、統市成交各路機砶米一千五百十九包、漢口沙市糙米二千四百五十包、本街辦去七八百包外、　由内地辦去、價雖繼漲角許、但一部份進户已　大觀望云、</p>

<p>絲廠長吐運滬不暢</p>
<p>絲廠長吐、邇因國内各絲織銷用激增、來源不暢、昨無錫各廠商借裝到七十件、轉車運杭、</p>
<p>賽馬期茶市愈寥落</p>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、因西商賽馬、洋行家祇有半日交易、市面愈形寥落、全市僅祇同孚永興保昌等行、買進珍眉針眉綠茶、共計一百三十六箱、抽芯珍眉頂盤做開一百二十五元、較前仍無漲跌、此外兩湖江茶、店莊亦有零星去化、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>文人與窮</h3>
<p>— 周本齋</p>
<p>從來文人與窮，這中間好像有什麽聯繫似的。其實，窮的，何止文人？文人的窮，又怎比得非文人的窮？然而，文人以窮爲「常談」了，好像只有文人是竊，非文人的窮也不算什麽。</p>
<p>文人説窮，一方表示其雅，一方則認爲窮與文有關，所謂「窮而後工」，雖不是原動力，至少是推進力。窮了，文就「工」了，這就顯得。但非文人的窮，是説不到這些的。他們正因爲窮，才被所謂文雅之士稱爲俗人。他們正因爲窮，才非但不能做文人，而且被文隔絶了，喪失了這相互間傳達情意的工具。他們正因爲窮，才形成這特殊的文人一羣。而且，連窮都成爲文人自命和標榜的工具，他們的窮被擯棄在圈外，不算什麽。</p>
<p>文人的窮，該與非文人的窮不同罷。</p>
<p>那麽，非文人的窮，是生活的窮：文人的窮，則是遭遇的窮。文人是讀書人中間的優秀羣。讀書人即是士。士者，仕也，要「學而優則仕」。不仕，就是不遇；不遇，就是窮了。古人往往以「窮」字和「達」字對稱並用，就是這個意思。如孟子説：「窮不失義，達不離道」。又説：「窮則獨善其身，達則兼善天下」。如窮是指生活的窮，怎能「善其身」呢？從來文人是沿襲了這意義的。</p>
<p>因窮達的不同，文學也呈異觀。達者的文學，是歌頌文學。窮者的文學，是牢騷文學。這一分派，歐陽修在「梅聖俞詩集序」一文，説得清楚：「予聞世謂詩人少達而多窮。夫豈然哉？蓋世所傳詩者，多出於古窮人之辭也。凡士之藴其所有，而不得施於世者，多喜自放於山巓水涯之外，見蟲魚草木風雲鳥獸之狀類，往往探其奇怪，内有憂思感憤之鬱結，其興於怨刺，以道羈臣寡婦之所歎，而寫人情之難言，蓋愈窮則愈工。然則非詩之能窮人，殆窮者而後工也。予友梅聖俞，少以蔭，補爲史，累舉進士，輒抑於有司，困於州縣，凡十餘年。年進五十，猶從辟書，爲人之佐，鬱其所蓄，不得奮見於事業。……然時無賢愚，語詩者必求之聖俞。聖俞亦自以其不得志者，樂於詩而發之。故其平生所作，於詩尤多。世既知之矣，而未有薦之上者。……若使其幸得用於朝廷，作爲雅頌，以歌詠大宋之功德，薦之清廟，而追商周魯頌之作者，豈不偉歟！奈何使其老不得志，而爲窮者之詩，乃徒發於蟲魚物類羈愁感歎之言？世徒喜其工，不知其窮之久而將老也。可不惜哉」！這裏，所説「非詩之能窮人」，是很對的。詩文非但不能窮人，反之，且能使人不窮，顯達。詩文原是從士到仕的工具。工具有　效，便達，便做歌頌文學。這就是「幸得用於朝廷，作爲雅頌，以歌詠××之功德，薦之清廟，而追商周魯頌之作」，豈不偉歟！工具無騐，便窮，便做牢騷文學。這就是「發於蟲魚物類羈愁感歎之言」，可不惜哉！</p>
<p>但若所謂「窮者而後工」，「愈窮則愈工」，却有一個分辨。首先，這窮是指遭遇的窮，非指生活的窮，窮的内容决定「工」的内容。其次，即使由於遭遇的窮，也影響到生活的窮，但這不過對達而言，爲窮而已。因此，也還不能感到眞正窮的生活經騐，不　寫出眞正窮的生活實况。假如説「工」的話，那是牢騷的「工」，所謂「工愁善病」而已。</p>
<h3>紅河之濱</h3>
<p>— 流冰</p>
<p>在那遥遠的赤道旁邊，靜靜地憇息着被稱爲「東方之瑞士」的萬隆，在那兒，熱帶的椰子樹在深藍的天空下滋長着，一朶朶的白雲吊在椰子葉上飄盪，住在那兒的人們，全帶着一顆疲乏的心，帶着被太陽薰黑了的面孔。萬隆是幽美的，在萬隆的人們全也有着幽美的心。離萬隆不遠，更有一條秀麗的大河，曲折地穿過了爪哇島，兩岸上，椰子樹築成了河堤。在不知名的籐樹上，猿猴在跳躍啼鳴。這便是幽靜的紅河。</p>
<p>三年前，我夢一般地流浪到紅河之濱，給都市薰陶得石化的旅心，一旦接觸了這幽美的自然，便不知不覺的留戀起來了。在晚上，我喜歡獨自個兒抱着「曼陀鈴」，到紅河之濱去，坐在那高高的椰子樹下，對着如鈎的新月，對着靜靜的河水，彈着心愛的曲子，口裏哼着不純熟的馬來調。</p>
<p>一天晚上，我在唱着馬來調時，來了一位年老的馬來人。他用低微的聲調説：</p>
<p>「哇哇！今晚的月亮眞好呵」！（馬來人呌年輕的男子爲哇哇）</p>
<p>「唔！你老人家也很愛這地方嗎」？我用馬來話和他交談起來了。</p>
<p>「我知道你很愛這地方，每天晚上我見你坐在這里，我聽見你的歌聲」。</p>
<p>「對呀！你看，這里的天空是何等的清靜，這河水是何等的美麗呵」！</p>
<p>「哇哇！你説這河水美麗嗎！這是紅呵呵」！</p>
<p>「可是，河水一點也不紅呢」！我看着説。</p>
<p>「呵呵！這條河從前曾染着你們支那人的血呵」！他顫聲地喊着。</p>
<p>「支那人的血」？</p>
<p>「是呵！支那人的血，染紅了這條河」！他坐在我身旁，低下頭。一會，他慢慢地抬起頭來，他的眼光含着悲憤，低聲説：「哇哇！你知道嗎？這河爲什麽呌紅河呢？這里有個動人的故事呢。那是很久以前的事了，你們支那人的祖先，他們到爪哇來和我們的祖先做買賣，於是，你們的祖先便在爪哇種了田，做了屋子，和我們的祖先過着安樂的日子啦。</p>
<p>「可是，哇哇！有一天，忽然來了許多白人，就是現在統治這地方的白人呵，他們想你們的祖先的土田，想你們的祖先的房屋。但是，他們怕支那的皇上，不敢動手。後來聽説，他們去見你們支那的皇上，説支那人欺侮他們，要皇上重辦他們，呵！你們的皇上怎麽説呢？他説你們的祖先是化外之民，不關天國的事。就這樣，白人便回來了。他們有槍砲，有戰船，你們的祖先是被祖國遺忘了的人，便被白人殘殺着。支那人退走，一直退到這條河邊，不能再走了，便被那些兇惡的白人一個個殺死了，死屍丢在這條河裏，河水染着支那人的血，變成紅色了，這條河就呌做紅河了！」</p>
<p>「哇哇！現在河水早已澄清了，支那人却還是被故國遺忘着呵」！</p>
<p>説完，這老人跚跚地走了。我望着他的後影，望着河水，河水在我眼前變成紅色了。我急忙閉赳眼，跑了回來，老人的話深刻在我心上：</p>
<p>被故國遺忘的支那人們！</p>
<h3>餛飩担</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>别離</h3>
<p>— 彦夫</p>
<p>帶着一顆緊張而惆悵的心，我和秄一同從廣州到了香港。</p>
<p>這次到香港，是因爲候船返上海的原故。香港是我常到的地方，每外暑假往返故鄉，總是和幾個同學，在這個繁華的小島上留下些匆忙的脚痕；但這次是特别的，同來的不是一起返上海的同學，却是來送行的秄。</p>
<p>看見她那種依依不捨的神態，教我怎能不惆悵呢？我在起程前一天的晚上，把要回到上海的消息告訴她，她馬上便哭了，一壁伏在枕上鳴咽，一壁緊緊地握着我的手，心裏好像有千言萬語囑咐我，但又説不出半句話來，直至我跑出廳子去和，她的家人告别時，她才抹乾了眼淚從深夜中送我回家去。</p>
<p>我們是在輪船開行前一天到香港的，因爲想預先看看那些艙位，這天特别從香港渡海到九龍去。在渡輪上，我遠遠地　見那龐大的俄國皇后，便情不自禁地流起淚來。</p>
<p>在香港過了一夜，第二天早上我便下船。艙房裏，擠滿了乘客和苦力，我找到了一個床位，把行李放好，便和秄跑到船面上去。爲着想排除她那種别離的傷感，我常常把已往旅途上的情形説給她聽，有時又故意拿些别的問題來問她，然而她總是默默地不做聲的。</p>
<p>「秄，你看，海水的顔色眞美麗了。你看見遠遠那隻帆船麽？」我又故意的問她。</p>
<p>没有回答。瞧瞧她，眼睛正紅紅地混滿了淚。</p>
<p>兩個兒都沉默着，我腦海翻起了暑期中的往事；我憶起了晨曦時越秀山上的凉風，憶起了黄昏時荔枝灣裏的金黄色的水。</p>
<p>輪船開行的時候到了，警告送船的鐘聲已經響過，我從船艙裏把她送出來。走到梯口，她突然緊緊地握着我的手：</p>
<p>「祝你—順—風—」</p>
<p>喉嚨咽着了，她的淚又淌下來，我的眼睛不禁也迸出幾滴熱淚。揩了揩眼睛，她又説：</p>
<p>「明年一放暑假就快快回來啦」！</p>
<p>顫抖的聲音是從無可奈何的心情中迸出來的，我點點頭，把她扶上了梯子。眼淚再次淌下來的時候，梯子給工人弄下了。</p>
<p>船在移動着丁，我站在甲板上，對着她揮手巾，眼淚更不自由主地直淌下來；把揮着的手巾抹抹眼睛，再舉起來那麽熱情地㨪着。這時音樂室傳出一片輪船開行時的樂聲，聲聲都尖酸地刺進我的心坎裏！</p>
<h3>北平風光（獨幕喜劇）（五）</h3>
<p>— 徐訐</p>
<p>（張德娟上）</p>
<p>韓：張小姐，想你到想在，你總算來啦！你知道我是多麽的愛你，（身子靠近去）</p>
<p>張：你是誰？</p>
<p>韓：我愛你，你知道嗎？（抱住了她）張小姐！你眞可愛，我平生第一次看見你這樣的人呀！父親直説我母親可愛，我母親美麗，其實那有你萬分之一可愛呢？</p>
<p>張：你，……你……你。</p>
<p>韓：（吻了她）我愛你，你的嘴唇眞嫩啊！（吻）妹妹你眞可愛！</p>
<p>張：唉！你的兩臂眞有力呀！你……你也眞可愛啊！</p>
<p>卜：（上）老韓！</p>
<p>韓：（驚）……</p>
<p>韓：我是忘其所以了，張女士！我們今天用的是計策，我想你同卜還是愛下去吧！</p>
<p>張：計策？</p>
<p>韓：我們本想在我强你的時候他來安慰你的，誰知道我會忘其所以了！老卜！我眞對不起你！不過，此後你們還是愛下去吧！</p>
<p>張：韓先生，也奇怪，我是眞的被你吸去了！我會永久愛你的了！</p>
<p>韓：張女士！可是我還没有這兒夥計有錢呢！老卜很愛你，你别使我對不起朋友！</p>
<p>張：但是我只愛你！</p>
<p>卜：老韓！愛原是這樣的，好，你們做愛人吧！</p>
<p>劉：老韓！怎麽辦？（上）</p>

<p>劉：王掌櫃！我們不賣舖板了，</p>
<p>掌：晤……不賣也好，不過二塊錢還我。</p>
<p>劉：（拿着二塊錢，響着。）王掌櫃！你眞是俠義之人！你看，這位是張小姐，這位是王掌櫃，最慷慨的王掌櫃！</p>
<p>張韓：（親蜜地）</p>
<p>卜：王掌櫃，他們倆今天在這兒結婚，好不好？</p>
<p>掌：好！好！</p>
<p>劉：（寫二張紙交給掌櫃）這是請帖，請掌櫃今天來喝酒。</p>
<p>掌：一定來恭賀，一定來恭賀。（要走。）</p>
<p>劉：送一點禮吧，不好意思！</p>
<p>掌：我没有錢呀！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>譚悠閑之道</h3>
<p>— 戈白</p>
<p>悠閑是美德，那種謙謙然的君子風度，是我們中國人獨特的民族性。</p>
<p>早是提烏籠上茶館，午飯赴書場嚼瓜子五香荳，回來從稻香村或老大房打個轉，三角的，長方的，大包小紥的茶食糖菓滿載而歸，晚膳更是三杯高梁下肚，於是有條不紊，燈下與妻兒同樂，吃芝蔴牛皮糖，譚城隍廟裏放烏龜，一室之内，樂也融融，横到床上，也不致做隔壁大火燒等惡夢，一宵無話，直抵來朝，又是紅日滿窗矣。</p>
<p>第一果然胞胎没有投錯，生而爲中國人，第二祖上積德，無論造孽汗血，總是兒孫之福，祇要四時八節，像像樣樣磕頭上祭，於心無愧，就是孝子順民了。</p>
<p>若有清興，八圈麻將，打打茶圍，不能説狂嫖濫賭，難得做世把人，何必要黎明即起？如若吸上鴉片，既可保祖産，又能退火氣，有美皆備，無麗不臻，悠閑之道，止於此矣！</p>
<p>試觀斗室之内，豆火如螢，那樣抬起了腿，歪側着頭，挑烟發泡，獨目相看，一口濃茶一口烟，不要説東北淪亡，遠在天邊，就是一二八槍聲四起，也不過登三層樓遥觀閘北大火燒耳。</p>
<p>其他小節，若雨天上街，不要横衝直撞，須知甯可濕衣，不可亂步；呌黄包車不説一角，而曰二百四十文，因大小（洋）不同，一粥一飯，當思來處不易也。中秋賞月，登曬台而徘徊，十月吃蟹，對瓶菊而吟詩。年三十夜燃守歲燭，年初一親自點天香。</p>
<p>鴉片榻畔，課子讀書，庶幾青出於藍！</p>
<h3>劍橋新圖書館開幕感言</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>報載英國劍橋大學新建圖書館開幕消息概要：可容書架長四十三哩，藏書一百五十萬種，美煤油大王捐助巨欵。三讀之後，不禁感嘅系之。爲的是自己現在國内一所大學裏服務，而這大學還堂堂乎冠有「國立」二字。説到藏書的貧乏，提起要使人短氣，幾次我去借幾本很平常的書，把書目週而復始查過，十九是失望的。更有一位私立大學的朋友爲着某一個專門問題，抱着十二萬分的希望跑來借書，我領他去，而竟是一無所得。</p>
<p>我相信，我更肯定的説，這並不是一種奇蹟，我國大學裏的藏書的貧乏，恐怕一般的情形都是如此。</p>
<p>也許有些人會出而這樣解釋：「中國是一個貧窮的國家，圖書館的歷史尤極短淺，當然是比不上外國；再過三五十年，總不會再像現在這樣貧乏。」其實這何能使人心服，中國的歷史却比外國來得久遠，依照「累積」的定律講，我們應該比外國强。長此下去，即再過三五十年也還是一樣的，我敢斷定説。</p>
<p>毛病在那裏？就爲的是一般的學校經費支配得太不得當，把行政費佔據了統計紙上的曲綫的最高峰，而建設費却眞微之又微，圖書的購買自然只好擱起不談。而且學校又多衙門化，負責的人都有「五日京兆」之患，過一天算一天，也就没有人去賣力爲學校前途着想，談什麽建設，只要馬虎過去，就算了事。</p>
<p>談到這裏，更想及中國一般擁有巨萬財産的富人，也都慳吝不堪，只圖自家生活之享樂，很少有人肯拿點錢出來辦文化事業，若洛基菲勒一捐而二十五萬鎊者更絶無其人焉。××圖書館被燬於一二八之役，兩年之後還要靠德國的捐贈，才能復興。有這樣一個比較好的圖書館來撑場面，總算還是差强人意的事哩。</p>
<p>我不知國人看了上述的一則新聞，究作何感想？而中國文化水凖的低落，其原因恐亦與此有關吧！</p>
<h3>媽媽</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>每次回到家裏，總見媽媽的髮兒一次比一次稀薄了，枯焦中夾雜着灰白，髮髻呌逝去的光陰給剥削得更小啦。</p>
<p>媽媽出身是在鄉村，年輕時割過羊草，放過牛，挑過柴担兒上街。聽説那時鷄子祇三文錢一個，燒餅一文錢一大塊，可是媽媽難得有點上嘴。後來到上海，跟爹爹幹作場，活兒做到半夜，餓着肚子去睡覺。現在嗎，可仍得料理家事，早上，帶了秤和籃兒上菜場，她會把咱歡喜吃的東西買回來，南瓜啦，芋頭啦。逢咱不在家，便硬把家人的扔下一點留給咱—霉爛了，仍得留着。</p>
<p>咱永遠不會忘掉的，就是在外邊幹活兒，老把媽媽的容顔貼在自家兒的眼皮上，打理想裏出神地瞧着，那麽慈和的笑意呵，棕黄色的臉上有闊淡的眉兒，平庸的鼻子，多年的沙眼患者呢，眼珠老給淚水包圍着，嘴兒是不會説一句怒話的嘴兒，柔和的聲音會呌一個忤逆乖戾的兒子跪下懺悔的。在客地的旅夢裏，常常似乎隱約聽見媽媽喊咱的名字。可是！瞪開眼兒的時候，媽媽呢？在家裏呵，她的柔聲和慈容給帶在咱生活的旅途上，收音機似的，它挑撥起思念，亦慰藉了離愁。</p>
<p>好像兩支鋭釘，在媽媽的生命上打下，當她回憶起咱兩個哥哥的夭折，就會激起一點舊的創痛。</p>
<p>「養到你們這末大啦，會説，會笑，會跳，你們小時候有些兒病痛，就呌咱像没腦袋的蒼蠅。不巴望你們發財升高啊，可别忘掉，你媽養育你們的苦楚」。每逢咱和弟弟在媽媽面前嬉笑跳躍的時候，她就會把這話重温一遍的。</p>
<p>在外面，常常想帶點東西回去給媽媽吃，可是，没有什麽呵！水果，凉性的，媽媽是長年的胃寒病患者。閒食，一向她所摒棄的，但。她却例外的愛好栗子，她愛栗子的焦香。但，她不要咱常常買，「這勢口錢難挣，能省的省掉吧。」牢牢地記住便把這點話用濃的墨汁寫在手册上，附記着一些仁慈的姿態，用潔白的手巾包裹着，偉大的母愛呵，永遠地在兒子的胸懷裏深藏着，甚麽可使我向人世誇耀的呢？遺産和咱是没有好感的，咱將接受的，是——</p>
<p>媽媽的偉大的慈愛呵。</p>
<h3>上海第一托兒所停辦了</h3>
<p>— 不白</p>
<p>咱們這個老大的中國，事事落人於第，可是咱們的文化是最先發達，因此目外人爲夷狄，妄自尊大。可是自雅片戰爭（嚴格説來，該當是義和團後），咱們這種自尊的心理，一旦爲列强的一切物質文明所震碎了！於是一味去模仿外人，一切唯外人爲馬首是瞻，人云亦云，眞是可笑。</p>
<p>我説，模仿外人並不是不好，可是一味模仿，而自己的創造心一點都没，那種模仿不是太無意義了麽？我們的模仿應該是創造性的。</p>
<p>近來文化市面上，由於外洋運輸而來的大批「洋」理論，因此人們抓着一種理論，不顧中國環境而實施他們的理論</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>工作，可是因爲没有顧到理論是和環境有聯繫的關係的，所以往往把美麗的理想撞了個粉碎，抱了個痛苦的臉兒莫知所之了！</p>
<p>過去曾有一度托兒所有論爭。主張托兒所在中國能够存在者，常把蘇聯的托兒所來借喻所以能够存在的理由，這未免是可笑極了。要曉得托兒所之所以能在蘇聯「眞正」實施者，因蘇聯的政制根本和咱們中國兩樣。至於資本主義各國的托兒所能够存在的理由（當然這種存在是知蘇聯的不同的）。因托兒所根本是資本主義的社會政策之一。回顧咱們中國，資本主義是否發達到如英美呢？</p>
<p>因此，托兒所的原則是對的，至於在中國實施，非把中國的環境要顧到不可。筆者曾和一個鐵廠工人談話，他爲生兒而苦悶，我熱心地對他説：「何不寄養到托兒所去呢？」等到他曉得托兒所每月寄養費需要八元的時候，他伸了伸舌子説：「我一　所賺的也不到二十元，如何能把八元　寄養一個孩子呢？」因此他告訴我，他的孩子寄養在鄉下，每個月只需要兩元寄養費够了！</p>
<p>中國如果要辦到托兒所，非把寄養費减低到兩元不可，可是事實上能够麽？我的回答是這麽斷决：「不可能」！你看，第一托兒所的停辦，雖不明示因爲經濟的關係，實則在他們將來要「試辦」一個「小規模」的這一點上看來，可知他們經濟的拮拙了！然則八元寄養費還感到結拙呢！</p>
<p>筆者最後得鄭重申明：我根本不反對托兒所的原則，不過我甚希舉辦托兒所者，或熱心於托兒所的諸公，切勿濫用外國（蘇聯或甚至英美）的理論，而一點都不顧到目前中國這一個環境。</p>
<h3>旅途</h3>
<p>— 永泊</p>
<p>夜。</p>
<p>夜色籠罩了迷茫的山野，怪風嘯呌着：荒塜間浮起一盞鬼火，點綴着這陰森的世界。</p>
<p>我擺盪着疲乏透了的肢體，舉目四顧，然後再戰慄地在路旁的指路碑上坐下。瞬間的休息是難得的呵。</p>
<p>我孤寂地默念着：這長長的途程，滿身負荷着荆棘的傷痕。—傷痕已是歷久的累積呢！</p>
<p>在星光的輝映下，我審視着胸前肩上斑斑的血迹，心頭却陡的感到一陣悽厲的痛楚。荆棘的刺是多尖！多鋭利！尤且，兩旁有毒蛇隱伏，豺狼匿踪，噬人的虎豹的窺尋。—險呵！眞險呵！這跋踄過的途程。</p>
<p>但，前路，還不是一樣？荆棘是愈高而愈密，愈密而刺愈鋭，兩旁也照樣有着毒蛇豺狼虎豹的遁隱；我滿身負荷着傷痕的殘軀，將何適以何從？</p>
<p>徘徊在中途，祇有靜待着死亡的降臨；向原路後退，當初又何必來熬受這酸辛與苦痛？現在的出路只有前進，前進，不斷的前進！</p>
<p>我舉目四顧孤寂地默念着：</p>
<p>—夜，必然會消逝；黎明，也必然會誕生的。</p>
<p>一盞盞鬼火忽然都没有了。</p>

<h3>一九三五年式美國新車紀要</h3>
<p>— 鈍訥</p>
<p>式樣機構無多改變</p>
<p>經濟安適兩大目標</p>
<p>光陰過去得眞快。一千九百三十五年又在眼前了。不説别的。單將汽車的式樣改變來説。一到歲尾年頭。就有許多新車上市。顧主們剔舊迎新。又自不免忙碌一番。現在雖不過是深秋氣候。歐美各車廠的工程師門。都在鈎心鬭角。計劃明年的新車。胃些車廠不但計劃就緒。連樣車也已公佈了。不過大部份的美國廠家。目下正是軍書旁午。工作極度緊張的時候。據上月底美國汽車製造中心區第德羅消息。對於明年度各種汽車的轉變。有一個梗概的紀述。大意是一九三五年式的汽車。式樣機構都没有十二分顯著的變更。售價方面力求低廉。以期汽車的暢銷。獲得市場的開展。</p>
<p>美國所製造的汽車。在售價方面大别分爲三類。一種是高貴的車子。售價高昂。一種是中價車。比了高價車略爲低廉。還有一種是最普遍的低價車。是專門供給一般社會所需要的。這三種車子。因爲售價各别。所以式樣機械方面。也就免不了有些差别。據稱一九三五年式的新車中。中價和高價兩種汽車。較之現行的一九三四年式都没有什麽大更改。好像是要把一九三四式汽車。再呌他延長一年似的。這個原因是在維持現在的賣價不使高增。而令汽車業的前途愈得好轉。</p>
<p>一種汽車若要多所改革更進。並不是不好辦的事。不過這種改動。像式樣方面的改變。機力方面的增進等。都需一筆額外的金錢。這筆錢歸根到底。又不免要加在顧主們的身上。要是營業發達。購買旺盛的話。車價雖然增高了些。還好設法推銷。要是去貨不暢。銷路鈍滯。那末困難便來了。如要推銷。顧主們因爲售價關係。交相裹足。廠方於是不得不减削售價。以求脱手。這樣的時而增進。時而贬貶價。事實上是很麻煩的。不但如此。有時還要失却顧客們的信仰心。好像出爾反爾。廠方舉棋不定。引起購客們的觖望。所以美國中價車和高價車廠方面。爲避免因更變式樣機構而增價。又因銷路不暢而重復原價的種種麻煩起見。索性觀望一年。對於一九三五年新車。抱着保良穩重的態度。不希望顯顯的革新。以爭一日的短長。</p>
<p>講到低價車呢。情形就有些不同了。各廠的競爭。非常劇烈。眞所謂各出匠心。巧思獨運。所以明年的新車。究竟將變動到怎樣地方。一時還説不上來。不過顯著的改動確是難免的。美國的低價汽車的大工場。就有三家。這三家差不多是婦孺皆知的。可以不必介紹。他們現在正在「閉門造車」。一到季冬初春。便是「漏臉」給大家看。到那時候。當然免不了一番熱閙。現在據計劃這些車子的機師專家們聲稱。所有大部份的設計工作。差不多將次就緒了。不過他們的工作還很忙碌。看上起不到年底。不會完成的。所以一般人推料。這種新車大概在本年底。就可和大家見面。等到歲首萬象回春。這幾種銷路最大。去胃最好的車子。也就免不了要活躍一番哩。</p>
<p>車輛的銷數。對於時間也很有關係。一年之中。有幾個時期是汽車銷路頂好的。還有幾個時期就有些遜色了。即以今年而講。到目下已經三季過去了。所剩的不過冬季罷了。汽車銷路最暢旺的時間在初夏的一二月裏。一過深秋。買賣的高峰已過。便逐漸的下落。越到新車將上市未登場的當兒。各式車子去路呆滯。他的原因是。買車子的顧客們在這個時候。都不願意貿然購置一輛新車。一定要等到盛大的汽車展覽會開過。方始决定他選擇的方針。所以在十月十一月這兩個月裏。節季上的衰落時期已經到臨。車商們不能有很奢的希望。今年全年的美國汽車産量。據估計約在二·八○○·○○○輛左右。</p>
<p>福特廠的出品計劃。差不多是和其他各家。不相連絡而獨立的。所以新車的設計製造儘可盡量改善。據聞其一九三五年式的新車模型在本年十一月裏。就可和公衆相見。派卡車的新模型在一個月之前。已經登場了。司蒂倍克呢。比了派卡還要早。今年夏季已經給樣子大衆看。現在市上流行的也很多了。其他各廠家的新出品。大概要到明年一月一日纔能現其色相。</p>
<p>因爲國民汽車展覽會的停止舉行。給予各廠家以極大的自由。因爲在往年。一到開會期近。大家免不掉日夜開工。以期新車應時而生。現在既緩開幕。就有很充裕的時間規劃一切了。一九三五年式新車的最大特色。和大家研究改革的最大目標。在於經濟安全及適舒三項。至於速度與機力呢。那末現在各式汽車。他已很可對付了。</p>
<p>據某汽車製造廠當局宣稱。「汽車製造商都很明瞭。要求汽車事業的蒸蒸向上。惟有從不增高售價着手。所以今年各廠家不預備有强度的更改者。其原因不出乎想壓低售價。如果一輛車子要改變新式。結果售價方面就要增進不少。」我們聽了這一番話。就很可以明白。爲什麽各車廠不預備對新車有很顯著的更改原因了。而另一方面呢。也可以推測到一般經濟的好轉。其現象尚没有預料的滿意。</p>
<p>市上最流行的三種著名低價汽車。其中兩家的汽車。競爭既烈。改革亦勤。差不多每届新車上市的時候。總得有些新的玩意兒供獻給大衆。决不爲默默無聞的過去的。所以福特車廠對於他的新出品。不時在改良計劃之中。其中的一種據説在本年十一月裏説可以出世。大家都相信。這新車大體上是很輕盈的形式上呢。略爲流綫化的。</p>
<p>雪佛蘭計劃他的新車已經有六個月的時期了。講到他的車身的式樣。彷彿像半流綫化式的拉薩爾差不多。至新雪佛蘭的引擎。究經還是繼續六缸呢。還是採取八只輕汽缸。那末尚在未定之間。所以外面人也無從推測。直形式和Ｖ式八缸引擎。在雪佛蘭廠中。都經製造試騐過的。</p>
<p>明年的潑萊茅斯新車。式樣上比較要大一些。所用的馬托很有更改。所以機力也就增加了不少。至於外形上的流綫化。比了他的聯枝出品第沙多和克雷斯勒。總要差一些。哇爾特司摩别爾據説式樣方面也要大有改動。其他的各車。改革之處大約不多。明年新車的附屬品亦將改良。以求增進銷路。對於一年來所發現的一九三四式車的缺點。都將設法補救。總之式樣方面力求美觀。而略帶一點流綫化。是最大的目標。</p>
<h3>喜臨門新車概况</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>以「安全第一」</p>
<p>爲搆造原則</p>
<p>比來汽車界人士常相告曰。目今英國汽車之搆製技巧。與機械工程天才。當可由喜臨門新出各種式樣覘之也。嘗考一般人士。所以有此論調。蓋以喜臨門所具各種顯著特色。多至不勝枚舉。故吾人縱或偶一寓目。亦即知其品質。精優卓絶。洵非尋常同類出品所可相提並論。按過去十二個月中。廠方對於喜臨門新車。雖無若何重大興革。但其種種改良。固已大有裨於舒適與現代駕車樂趣。至若以本市車輛狀况而言。則此種進步。得益尤非淺鮮焉。</p>
<p>新車刻正陳列於大西路福林汽車公司樣子間。機械精良。搆製巧妙。確爲英國出品中之無上傑搆。其全部製造。不論鉅細部分。蓋皆以「安全第一」。爲其顛撲不破之原則。純鋼車架之上。配以純鋼車身。相得益彰。彌極堅優。况以車身裝置所用之自動彈簧組織。不論儎重若何。均可自行較凖合度。是以路面顫震傾欹等患。完全消滅於無形。而置身車上者　。因料如坐安樂椅上。彌覺舒暢適意之至。至於調排。雖初習駕駛者。亦極便於處置。蓋其所裝齒輪。爲諧動式也。新式通氣裝置。爲喜臨門新車之又一重要特色。無論寒夏。儘可隨意調節。藉以享受極度爽暢。而不復感受風陣或氣悶之任何不快。此則尤足稱者。厥爲喜臨門所獨有之襯托裝置，按此爲數年前所發明。今已成爲喜臨門之標凖特色。且因屢經改良。益臻完善。故所謂襯托力裝置。其效用之宏偉。爲其餘一切滅震器所不及。蓋已經衆公認。毫無疑義矣。喜臨門之前座與後座。地位胥極寛敞。而新製出各種式樣。尤極軒暢舒適。此蓋以其墊靠踏脚等。重新佈置。彌極巧妙故也。</p>
<h3>鄂建廳舉辦貨車汽油消費量測騐</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>頃據漢口通訊。湖北省建設縣。以本省自積極建設以來。各處公路。先後完成。所用運貨汽車。輛數激增。因此汽油一項。遂爲日常大宗支出。爰爲節省經濟。欵不虚耗起見。特彙集各路所用各種運貨汽車。於上星期三日。由各該車輛當地經售行家。分别駕車駛行至距黄陂約十英里之處。藉以測騐各該車輛之汽油消耗量焉。</p>
<p>此項測騐。由建廳派員主持。組織嚴密。辦理認眞。故其結果至爲可靠。凡參加測騐之每輛運貨車。均於開始測騐以前。以仔細秤過之規定重量。裝載於其上。及至出清汽油池中汽油。並將引擎駛動。俟化油機最後一滴汽車。業已用罄。然後各以五加侖汽油。貯入油池。正式啟行。賽時以建廳專車爲前導。常保持其速率爲每小時三十英里。參與競賽諸車。則緊隨其後。魚貫以行。各車之間。均隔有相當距離。並以另一專車殿於其後。至於供應車。則於若干距離外。遥相尾隨。及抵黄甸村。停車進食。並攝影後。即仍折返。於是當與賽各車。汽油靠罄。引擎忽停。非加油不克前進之時。乃由建廳專車。詳細檢視各車所走哩程。結果以雪佛蘭運貨車成績爲最佳。計汽油五加侖。行程六十七英里。平均每加侖行程爲十三點四英里。</p>
<h3>一九三五年式奧奔新車概述</h3>
<p>— 篔</p>
<p>八缸六缸兩大組</p>
<p>共計有八種式樣</p>
<p>一九三五年式奧奔新車。兹已出世。供各界人士採用。新車計分兩大組。每組各有式樣四種。即轎式。蓬轎式，勃羅亭式，及活頂轎式跑車是也。奧奔八缸汽車。輪距一二七寸。馬力一一五匹。六缸式輪距則爲一二○寸。馬力八十五匹。按此兩組新車。均側重於流線化。但其外觀形態。並無若何劇變。新車前部及發動機罩。設計尤爲精巧。彌足引人入勝。奧奔出品。原係分爲標凖組。及華貴組兩種。但廠方對於一九三五年份新車。兹已不復採用此種辦法。蓋新車每一式樣。均係設備齊全也。新車車頭燈及水箱格子等。一律克羅味鍍飾。熠熠生輝。燦爛悦目。關於乘客方面之各項便利裝置。一切齊備。置身車上。儘可隨心所欲。胥極靈便之至。車身加長而較低。地位益臻寛宏。前座尤爲軒敞。今可三人並坐。亦極寛暢舒適。新式低壓吸震器。及空氣墊襯之橡皮托架等。功能使一切顛震影響。消滅於無形。或减抑至最低限度。雙比率後輪軸。可使引擎速度减低。而車則繼續以高速率行驶。此項設備。兩組車上均可裝置之。惟須另照計值。最新通風系。前車門裝配分剖窗。後門則用活窗。引擎採用鉛質汽缸頭。動力瀰滿。效用倍宏。汽門動作及保冷系等。均具有極大進步。尤足稱者。兩組新車所裝原動力機。均極經濟合算。所有機油澄清器。空氣澄清器。滅聲器。以及機力燃料邦浦。曁節熱器等。一應齊全。車身純鋼</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>。彌極安全。即一切響聲。亦皆末由發生。駕駛板亦以鋼料製成。並爲車身之整個部份。要之新車任何部份。其設計構製。莫不研究盡善。則其到處爲人所歡迎。殆可斷言也。</p>
<h3>英國車輛肇禍案減少</h3>
<p>— 甘</p>
<p>—平均每日少死二人—</p>
<p>汽車肇禍事件。在英國亦爲難以解决之一個大問題。政府當局不惜費盡心力。以求運輸交通上之安全。最近其運輸大臣霍伯里休氏。曾在無綫電中作公開之播音演講。謂最近三個月來。即七月八月及九月。馬路肇禍事件而致人喪失生命者。其數目較前爲减。即較之一九三三年之同時期爲减少也。據霍氏當時所得之統計估計。其低减達百分之六·五。若以數目計。則死者約少一百四十人云。</p>
<p>但據實地查詢。則霍氏所報告之數目。尚在實在數之下。今年七八九三個月中。實死於汽車下者。其人數較之去年同時少去一百七十五人。或佔百分之八。故以日數而言。即此一季之中。英國各處每日因車輛失事而致喪失人命者。已减少約達兩人。若據以往之經騐而談。則每年之七八九三個月　。常爲一年中之最危險時期。其肇禍致命之案常較餘時爲高增。且今年之開始時。車輛肇禍案件較之去年同時爲多。而今有若是之結果者。殊爲難能耳。</p>
<p>英國車輛肇禍案之所以能低减者。據當局言。乃爲得力於道路安全政策之實施。及公衆對於運輸部所促起之道路安全問題之注意兩項。遲輸大臣對於道路肇禍案之件數。常用公佈方法。使大衆週知。並不時促起人民之注意。以達安全之途。其所公佈者。以每城市每羣之人數一○○·○○○爲單位。而使人有所比較。因之各城市之當局及民衆。不得不以最切效方法。使肇禍案件之减低。蓋此種事實之存在。乃爲各城市之疵點也。</p>
<p>運輸部對於倫敦近郊各處所發生之馬路肇禍案件。按期作每週之公佈。用統計方法。使人明瞭慘案之發生地點。原因及結果等。據霍氏之意。此種方法。對於此一問題之解决。頗爲有效。但若以鎮與鎮相比較。而不顧其人數之多寡。及區域之大小者。其事殊欠公允。不過此項統計最大收效之處。乃在促進當地之警察與運輸部共同注意禍事發生之地點。而集中其力量。以求解决及預防。如每一地點。能由此項統計而獲得實益。而以正眞之神精處之者。則對於道路肇禍案之可以大爲减少。乃亦意中事耳。在事實上因研究統計之結果。常可尋出某種禍事。常在某一地點或塲所發生。於是即可因其危險之常有而隨時加以注意。譬如肇禍之原因。是否因電車軌舖設之不適當而起。是否因馬路交叉點之危險。或黑暗之路隅而起。均可加以探究。而令共一一迎刃解决也。</p>
<p>運輸部大臣近又在計劃一種進行之方法。擬令各地當局由地圖上學習道路肇禍案之减免方法。此種地圖業已張置候用。地圖上即明示何處乃車輛肇禍案專易發生之處也。新近組織之馬路安全會。亦將利用此種地圖。以求統計上之最精細方法之實現。及其實用之效率。若干與汽車事業有關係者。則覺公这有所訂之法規爲可厭。但此種法規對於汽車事業之繁榮。不無資助之處。汽車業中若干領袖之意。以爲汽車肇禍案愈形减少。則大衆之購買汽車者將愈多。故若輩對於車輛肇禍之遏制。常以極大之帮助以促其實現也。</p>

<h3>National Examination and Selection Conference Declaration</h3>
<p>Government to Oversee University Graduation Exams</p>
<p>Examination and Appointment Sub-Offices to Be Established in Each Province</p>
<p>Provisional Plan for Civil Servant Protection Agreed Upon</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Full text of the declaration of the National Examination and Selection Conference: The Examination Yuan of the National Government convened the National Examination and Selection Conference in the capital on November 1, 1934. Representatives from central government agencies and various provinces, municipalities, and counties, as well as representatives and experts from national universities and independent colleges, attended. There were 160 attendees and 38 observers. A total of 95 proposals were discussed. The conference lasted five days and concluded successfully. A brief overview is presented here to inform the nation. Today, the Chinese people have two major aspirations: first, a clean and honest government; and second, national progress. To achieve progress in governance, it is essential to have definite standards for the promotion and demotion of civil servants. To achieve national progress, all talented individuals must have the opportunity to serve. To address both, it is imperative to select true talent through examinations and prevent opportunistic advancements through proper appointment procedures. This ensures that capable individuals hold positions without the mindset of a short-term appointment, and that competent individuals can achieve tangible results within three years. To achieve these goals, we have agreed on several practical measures. Let us first discuss the examination aspect. The state's selection of talent must originate from schools. The subjects tested should align with the educational level of the schools. In the future, the subjects and level of both general and higher-level exams should closely align with the curriculum standards or subject outlines set by the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, the Examination Yuan should, within possible limits and based on the nature of each type of examination, select several key reference books for each subject to define the scope of questions for a certain number of years. This not only provides objective standards for examinations but also guides young people in their studies. In recent years, government-administered graduation exams for middle schools have yielded positive results. If this practice can be replicated for specialized schools and above, standards can be raised and unified, which will undoubtedly benefit the future of higher education. The state's recruitment exams may also consider these grades. However, this is a major undertaking that requires time for preparation. Therefore, it is proposed that starting in 1938, graduation exams for specialized schools and above be administered by the government, thereby establishing a connection with recruitment exams. Education in border provinces is less developed than in the interior. If admission is not made more lenient, there will be no widespread opportunity for talent to emerge, which may negatively impact political unity. A provincial breakdown of the personnel who passed the two higher-level exams held in the capital last year and the general exam held in the capital this year reveals the scarcity of recruits from border provinces. Therefore, the Examination Yuan should compile statistics on the number of educated people in each province every one or several years. For provinces where the ratio falls below a certain threshold, the standards should be lowered to allow for more lenient admission. This will allow talent from all over the country to advance equally, and the culture of border provinces can gradually improve. Specialized technical personnel are dedicated to their specific fields, and their performance in general subjects cannot be weighted equally with specialized subjects. Therefore, the examination procedures for such appointments should be modified. Specialized subjects should be tested first, allowing technical personnel to demonstrate their expertise and preventing the regret of overlooking talent due to slightly weaker performance in general subjects. The essence of constitutionalism lies in the exercise of civil rights, and the outcome of this exercise depends heavily on the knowledge and ability of candidates. As we approach the implementation of constitutionalism, we must diligently follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and use examinations to assess the qualifications of candidates. However, there are many types of candidates, and election districts cover vast areas. General examination methods are difficult to apply. Therefore, candidate examinations should be divided into two types: screening and examination. In addition to written tests, methods such as qualification review and indirect examinations should be used as much as possible to ensure simplicity and feasibility. The specialized professions or technical personnel who are legally required to hold certificates have a significant impact on people's lives and property. These personnel were previously reviewed and registered by the competent authorities, who issued certificates. In the future, all such personnel should be examined or screened by the Examination Yuan. Those with competent authorities should first have their eligibility reviewed by the competent authorities. Those who pass the Examination Yuan examination will be issued a certificate of qualification and sent to the competent authority for legal registration. On the appointment side, the conference also made several important resolutions. Assessing administrative personnel according to definite and precise standards is an indispensable method for improving administrative efficiency. Furthermore, many civil servants in various agencies are currently recruited through recommendations rather than examinations, which inevitably leads to incompetence. Therefore, performance evaluations should be strictly enforced once a year, and a minimum elimination rate percentage should be set to clear the path to officialdom and promote the recruitment of qualified personnel who have passed the exams. Our country has a vast territory, and many localities rely on central government support. The implementation of all central government policies must be based on local conditions. However, there is a lack of connection between the central and local governments, and there is inevitable separation between the interior and the exterior. In recent years, intellectuals have flocked to the central government, making it difficult for remote provinces to recruit talent. Therefore, it has been decided to implement measures for the mutual transfer of civil servants between the central and local governments, so that the central government's intention to support local development and the principle of internal and external coordination are not merely empty words. The state must have definite standards for employing people. Therefore, there are regulations like the Civil Servant Appointment Law. However, due to the uneven levels of economic and cultural development in various regions and the insufficient distribution of personnel who have passed the exams and screenings, existing appointment regulations should be revised separately to broadly recruit talent and consider the facts. The means for expanding the qualifications for employment in remote provinces and regions, the manner for preferentially promoting Mongolian and Tibetan people, and the methods for broadly employing technical personnel and county assistants each have their specific circumstances and should be handled flexibly or through separate regulations. Appointing administrative personnel is a key function for employing people. Given the large number of officials in our country, it would be difficult to handle all appointment matters centrally. Entrusting them to the provinces would lack dedicated responsibility. To facilitate the promotion of appointments, appointment sub-offices should be established in each province, so that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy that all civil servants in the central and local governments must have their qualifications determined before being appointed can be realized. Modern scholarship is constantly evolving. If civil servants cannot keep pace with the times, the implementation of agency policies may be out of sync with the times. Furthermore, talent levels vary depending on education. Cultivating scholarship in addition to official duties will greatly assist in the implementation of policies. Therefore, practical methods should be determined for how to universally promote and diligently implement continuing education for civil servants, so that it can be a goal for future efforts. Matters such as civil servant protection and pensions have also been carefully studied and appropriate plans have been agreed upon separately. The above are just some of the major points. Our conference does not seek lofty theories but rather practical and feasible solutions. All resolutions must be implemented. The central government uses this conference to understand the actual difficulties of the local governments, and the local governments use this conference to understand the spirit of the central government policies. From now on, internal and external matters will be consistent, so as to ensure the smooth implementation of the examination and appointment system. All those responsible for examination and appointment administration who participated in this conference are determined to implement the resolutions of this conference. We also hope that the people of the country will provide timely supervision. This declaration is hereby made. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<h3>Smuggling Chinese into the U.S. and American Exclusionary Immigration Laws</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>Recently, thirty-eight overseas Chinese were smuggled into the United States from the British West Indian island of Trinidad. When the ship reached the American coast, four people became seriously ill and were thrown into the sea by the smugglers. Of the remaining thirty-four, eighteen have been discovered by U.S. government secret agents and will be deported back to China. The remaining sixteen have escaped the net and are also being hunted down.</p>
<p>This smuggling into the U.S. is known in the overseas Chinese community as "passing the barrier." The author spent two years in the West Indies and often heard news about overseas Chinese "passing the barrier." I have also spoken with overseas Chinese who have failed to "pass the barrier" many times. They are not unaware of the dangers of "passing the barrier," but despite the failures, people keep trying. The West Indies are located in the tropics. The only products are agricultural products such as sugar, tobacco, and coffee. In recent years, the supply of these products has exceeded demand, and prices have plummeted, which has affected the local economic prosperity. The livelihoods of overseas Chinese have been severely impacted, leading them to take desperate risks and "pass the barrier" to seek a living in the United States.</p>
<p>Before "passing the barrier," each overseas Chinese person must pay at least 500 U.S. dollars to the smugglers. They secretly board pre-arranged ships in remote locations under the cover of darkness. A small boat crowded with people tossed about on the tropical seas is already an inhumane existence. Moreover, they are afraid of being discovered by the outside world and can only crawl in the bottom of the hold, even struggling to survive in the coal piles. Sometimes, they set off from one location on an island and endure many days of hardship. Finally, someone on the boat says they have arrived in America. Then, they quietly disembark in the dark, thinking they have succeeded. Unexpectedly, when they open their eyes the next morning, they are still on the same island. The only thing that has changed is the location. They can only admit their bad luck. Sometimes, the ship enters U.S. territorial waters, and the customs patrol boat discovers them and comes to search. The smugglers, seeing that they cannot escape, tie up the "passengers" and throw them into the sea to feed the sharks. If the customs patrol boat is close by and throwing people into the sea might leave a trace, then they simply throw them into a raging furnace, instantly turning them into ashes.</p>
<p>Those who are lucky enough to reach the American coast "passing the barrier," but whose movements are not secret, are still discovered. At that time, they must still be imprisoned. After being tried and convicted, they are sent back to their original place. The government of their original country of residence often considers these "passing the barrier" overseas Chinese to be undesirable elements and does not allow them to re-enter the country, resulting in them ending up losing out on both ends. These poor creatures who are deported back to China are treated no differently from criminals on their way back to their country. And so-called returning to their country means only being sent to Shanghai. The overseas Chinese in the West Indies are almost entirely from Guangdong. The cost of traveling from Shanghai to Guangdong must be raised separately. The luckiest are those who safely cross the barrier. However, they can only live a clandestine life, unable to see the light of day. Especially during the "search and registration" period in "Chinatown," they feel even more embarrassed.</p>
<p>When we talk about the tragedy of Chinese people "passing the barrier," we cannot help but attribute it to the cruel American exclusionary immigration laws. Without these immigration laws, Chinese people could enter the United States as openly and honorably as Americans enter China. Why would they have to be so secretive?</p>
<p>There are three treaties between China and the United States regarding immigration. The first is the Burlingame Treaty of 1868. Article 5 of that treaty recognizes the right to change residence "as a natural and inalienable right." (According to the English translation.) It can be said to be the most equal treaty. The second is the Sino-American Supplementary Treaty of 1880. Article 1 of that treaty allows the United States to "regulate" or "limit" the number of Chinese laborers entering the United States and the number of years they can stay in the United States. However, it still clearly states that it "does not prohibit" Chinese laborers. Furthermore, that "limitation refers specifically to Chinese continuing to go to the United States to work as laborers. All other categories of people are not subject to restrictions." The third is the Chinese Labor Treaty of 1894. That treaty contains even more thorough provisions prohibiting Chinese laborers from entering the United States. However, that treaty was for a term of ten years. On January 24, 1904, the Chinese government declared that the treaty was null and void. Since 1904, there have been no new treaties between China and the United States regarding Chinese immigration. In other words, Chinese immigrants going to the United States should be treated in accordance with the Sino-American Supplementary Treaty of 1880 regarding laborers, and in accordance with the Burlingame Treaty of 1868 regarding non-laborers. However, the administrative and legislative authorities of the U.S. government have enacted and promulgated many extremely harsh domestic laws to restrict Chinese immigration, regardless of whether the content of the laws conflicts with the existing Sino-American treaties. According to the U.S. Constitution, treaties that the United States concludes with other countries and the laws of the federal government are considered the supreme law of the land. However, according to the precedent of the Washington Supreme Court, if domestic laws conflict with international treaties, the courts should judge cases based on the law or treaty that took effect last. If the treaty interests of a foreign government and people are thereby harmed, they can seek a solution through diplomatic means. The U.S. judicial authorities have no right to interfere. The U.S. government knows that China is not strong enough, and the Supreme Court is willing to indirectly and openly support it, so it dares to act as it pleases. However, treaties enjoy international legal protection, and the authority of a precedent of a national Supreme Court can never have the authority of international law. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court itself has clearly acknowledged that domestic laws that violate international treaties cannot have the effect of destroying the international treaty obligations that the United States has assumed. It can be seen that our country's tolerance of the American exclusionary immigration laws is entirely a matter of fact, not a matter of law. Even Americans cannot deny this.</p>
<p>The Sino-American Commercial Treaty of 1903 expired long ago. Negotiations for a new treaty have not made significant progress to this day. (See the author's article "The Key to Revising the Sino-American Commercial Treaty" in the "Current Commentary" section of this newspaper on February 2 of this year.) I remember that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the local Overseas Chinese Trust Company had petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take the opportunity of the revision of the Sino-American treaty to negotiate the harsh American immigration rules. We also believe that our country has sufficient reason to negotiate with the U.S. government. Therefore, we dare to use the recent "passing the barrier" incident of overseas Chinese to once again draw the attention of the diplomatic authorities.</p>

<h3>Lianyungang Project to Be Completed Soon</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to transportation circles, the Lianyungang project is nearing completion. The foundation of the pier is extremely solid. Since the start of berthing on October 1, cargo transportation has been booming. The total volume of imports and exports has reached over 10,000 tons per month, all of which are local products from Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces. Currently, only one 3,000-ton seagoing vessel can be docked. The remaining parts of the project are still in progress. The completion of the pier by the end of this year will allow for the docking of three vessels. The entire harbor project can be completed by next spring, allowing for the docking of eight vessels. Currently, the Longhai Railway and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are jointly operating land-sea transportation to promote the development of shipping and provide for the import and export of goods from the northwest and southwest. The plan is to complete and open three shipping routes: one from Lianyungang directly to Tianjin, one from Lianyungang directly to Qingdao, and one from Lianyungang directly to Guangzhou, passing through Shanghai. This has been approved by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<h3>The Boxer Protocol Does Not Explicitly Stipulate That British Troops Abandon Exercises Outside the Great Wall</h3>
<p>Simeon's Statement in the House of Commons</p>
<p>[London] During today's House of Commons meeting, Labour MP Jones inquired about the fact that the commander of the British troops in Shanhaiguan received a note from local Japanese representatives and the Manchu authorities on June 26 of this year, stating that British troops should not enter "Manchukuo." How is the British government handling this matter? Foreign Secretary Simeon replied that the British government has decided that British troops should abandon the practice of conducting exercises outside the Great Wall. The Boxer Protocol of September 7, 1901, does not explicitly permit this. The British government does not want to raise legal issues for discussion, so it has made this decision. Suitable exercise grounds can be found inside the Great Wall (the crowd laughed). Simeon ended by saying that he had no reason to believe that the government's decision would change. This "prohibition" also applies to the troops of other countries. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Case of Forbidding British Newspaper</h3>
<p>Liberal MP Raises Questions</p>
<p>[London] The Harbin Daily, run by Simpson, was recently banned from publication by the "Manchu" authorities. During today's House of Commons meeting, Liberal MP Mond raised questions about this matter. Foreign Secretary Simeon replied that the government has instructed the British Consul-General in Harbin, Garstin, to consult with Simpson and then make a request to the "Manchu" authorities. The "Manchu" authorities recently accused the newspaper of communist propaganda and banned its publication and attempted to expel its reporter and publisher, Simpson. Simpson fled to the British Consulate-General and then voluntarily went to Dalian. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>British and American Oil Companies Act in Concert with Japan</h3>
<p>Before the Monopoly Law Is Promulgated</p>
<p>Intended to Negotiate a Compromise</p>
<p>[London] Oil companies are hopeful regarding Japan's reply to British and American protests about the "Manchukuo" kerosene monopoly. It is said that the monopoly law has not yet been formally promulgated, and there is a possibility of negotiating a compromise that preserves the face of "Manchukuo" while protecting the interests of foreign oil companies and allowing the Manchurian Oil Company and the Dalian Refinery to obtain an appropriate share of the business. In this situation, oil companies are convinced that Japan's insistence that the proposed monopoly is an internal policy of "Manchukuo" and does not refer to the Nine-Power Treaty is intentional to avoid complex diplomatic disputes and serious repercussions for the naval conference. Oil companies believe that the path has been opened for British and American consuls stationed in Manchuria to negotiate a compromise in Changchun. As for rumors that the Japanese are now trying to alienate Britain and the United States, oil companies dismiss them with a smile, saying that foreign oil companies are now acting in concert.

<h3>British Side Considers Japan's Reply Unsatisfactory</h3>
<p>[London] It is reported that the Japanese government has replied to the British government's protest against the new law on the Japanese government's control of domestic kerosene companies. The British side considers the reply unsatisfactory. Although there is no basis for opposition in the treaty, the governments of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands all believe that it is unfair for the Japanese government to treat the important kerosene industry in this way.

<h3>Japan's Military Build-up Treats Mandated Territories as Forbidden Areas</h3>
<p>Report of the League of Nations Committee of Inquiry</p>
<p>Chairman Asks for Opening Up to Dispel Doubts</p>
<p>[Geneva] After the League of Nations' Committee on Mandates met this morning to discuss the Japanese government's report on the Pacific islands formerly owned by Germany under mandate, it held a closed meeting for two hours. During that time, the issue of Japan's appropriation of 800,000 yuan to build docks and airfields was raised. The chairman, the Italian representative, Ciotri, asked whether foreign aircraft could land on these islands. The Japanese representative, Ito, did not give a definite answer to this question. The chairman also said that Japan currently prohibits foreigners from traveling to these islands, or allows them to travel but subjects them to strict surveillance. This kind of news has been reported with great certainty. If you want to end it, the best way is to cancel all bans. Ito replied that many of the reports about this matter were intentional. The Japanese authorities had to implement special plans because the islands were not peaceful, which may have been the case. Ito also said that the Japanese Navy had conducted exercises near these islands at some time, so it did not want foreigners to travel there. As for the case of a certain British clergyman being prohibited from traveling to the islands within his religious jurisdiction, he would investigate it. (Central-Transocean News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Japan has submitted an annual report to the League of Nations on the situation of its mandate over the Pacific Islands. The Committee on Mandates of the League of Nations has reviewed it. The Japanese representative, Minister to Warsaw Ito, attended to explain. Recently, newspapers have reported that Japan has been making things difficult for foreigners and ships traveling to the ports of the various islands in the Pacific under Japanese rule. Mr. Ito explained this matter, saying that these reports have other motives and should not be lightly believed. As for other special circumstances, he will explain them in detail after he has investigated them thoroughly. The chairman of the committee said that the world's newspapers have been criticizing the internal situation of the islands under Japanese mandate in the Pacific. For Japan's sake, it would be advisable to find a way to dispel the doubts of the world. The best way to quell the rumors is to open up the islands and allow foreigners to enter and exit freely. The committee requested Japan to supplement its explanation because the annual report submitted by Japan was incomplete in content. (Note: The criticism of the world's newspapers probably refers to the military installations set up by Japan in the islands under its mandate in the Pacific.) (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>United States Pays Close Attention</h3>
<p>Unwilling to Express an Opinion for the Time Being</p>
<p>[Washington] When the League of Nations Committee on Mandates was meeting, someone asked the State Department about the U.S. attitude toward the former German territories in the Pacific under Japanese mandate. The State Department official spoke evasively, unwilling to give a direct answer, only saying that this issue was "very specialized" and required the interpretation of the League of Nations, so the United States was unwilling to express an opinion. As for the rumors spread in Geneva that Japan had closed off two mandated islands in the South Pacific and prohibited foreigners from entering the port, the Undersecretary of State was also unwilling to confirm or deny them.

<h3>Japan Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Prohibiting Foreign Ships from Sailing</p>
<p>Said Not to Violate Mandate Regulations</p>
<p>[Tokyo] On the 5th, the League of Nations Committee on Mandates accused Japan of illegal acts in its mandated islands in the South Seas. The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement today: The Japanese government abides by the mandate regulations and has not violated the law. The accusations of the League of Nations Committee on Mandates are unfounded. Foreigners are free to land on the islands under Japanese mandate and have not been prohibited from doing so. Also, regarding the navigation of foreign ships, because the islands are designated routes for the government, only Japanese ships are allowed to sail. There should be no problem with this either.

<h3>Naval Negotiations Deadlocked, Britain Efforts to Mediate</h3>
<p>Simon Meets Separately with U.S. and Japanese Representatives</p>
<p>Japanese Government Actively Preparing Treaty Abolition Procedures</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Simon and U.S. Representative Davis discussed the deadlock in the British, American, and Japanese naval talks in the House of Commons this afternoon. This discussion has garnered considerable attention, as it is widely hoped that Simon can devise a plan to keep the naval talks going. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] Through the efforts of British diplomats, the naval talks may resume today. Foreign Secretary Simon will invite Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira to a private meeting to propose a plan to continue the talks. The U.S. delegation also learned of this news from Simon's side today. Britain is likely to open a path for Japan, allowing Japan to propose a suggestion similar to what its ambassador, Saitō, recently did in Washington: that Japan actually desires to achieve naval equality over a number of years. If so, the U.S. representatives would be happy to participate in the talks. However, the U.S. representatives now state that they will do nothing but listen. The general public now feels that the talks will not fail or remain deadlocked for long and will eventually reach a compromise. However, this compromise may be insignificant.</p>
<p>When a spokesman for the U.S. delegation met with a Reuters correspondent today, the correspondent asked whether there was any possibility of a compromise between the U.S. and Japan regarding naval ratios and whether there was any hope for a satisfactory outcome of the talks. The spokesman replied, "Sometimes there is no compromise, and sometimes there is a compromise." His words were ambiguous and elusive. It is widely expected that Britain will step into the gap to find a way to achieve an outcome. Although Britain's views are closer to Japan's, Britain is now eager for the three countries to maintain the talks and avoid a breakdown. Japan has no room for maneuver because it insists on its demand for equality, as it feels it cannot change its position or back down for the sake of national dignity.</p>
<p>Japanese Representative Matsudaira's attitude is more moderate, and he is quite willing to make a slightly broader request for equality. However, the extremely nationalistic army and navy officers in his country view him as too moderate and will not allow him to place too much emphasis on diplomatic friendship. Since Matsudaira's actions are not free, he hopes that Britain will find a way to mediate and formulate a plan that contains Japan's more moderate demands and is also acceptable to the UK and the US. At the same time, Matsudaira also warned his government not to hastily announce the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty. While the abolition will eventually take place within the year, it will not be announced in London for the time being. Before this bombshell drops, all parties will still try their best to keep the London talks going. The Washington Naval Treaty stipulates that a conference of all naval powers must be convened within one year of the abolition. At that time, the Washington and London naval treaties will expire. The conference venue will be either in London or Washington, with London being more suitable. The time will be in the summer of next year. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The issue of abolishing the Washington Treaty was passed by the Naval Military Council on the 29th and by the Marshal Council on the 31st. Now, only the approval procedure of the Privy Council remains, and it is confirmed that the abolition will be announced at the end of this month or the beginning of next month.

<h3>Dutch Representative Condemns Japan's Monopoly in the Far East</h3>
<p>Strongly Advocates Boycotting Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Hague: Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs representative史左傑 (Shi Zuojie, phonetic transliteration) recently returned from Batavia and strongly criticized Japan's expansion of political and economic influence in the Pacific, especially in the Dutch territories. Mr.史氏 represents the Netherlands in trade negotiations with Japan. Mr.史氏 claimed that the Dutch East Indies has prepared import quotas for 54 types of Japanese goods and said that "we must squeeze out the Japanese, whether the Japanese are willing or not, they must accept our quotas." "One hundred percent of the Japanese in the Dutch East Indies are consolidating their sphere of influence. Japan's goal is to control the East Indies' commerce. The Japanese cannot separate commerce from politics, so they regard themselves as the rulers of the East. This concept can be seen in their behavior in the East Indies. The success or failure of Japanese-Dutch commercial negotiations will depend on how much of the East Indies' products Japan is willing to purchase. All the warehouses in Batavia are full of Japanese goods. I personally doubt whether the Dutch and Japanese can compromise." However, I do not deny that cheap Japanese goods have their place in the East Indies. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Batavia: Japanese Representative 越田 (Yueshita, phonetic transliteration) met with Dutch East Indies Representative 海德連 (Haidelian, phonetic transliteration) at 6 p.m. on the 5th to discuss the report issue, but the two sides could not reach an agreement. The Japanese delegation, in an effort to overcome the difficulties, requested instructions from its home government and, at the same time, secretly prepared to return home in anticipation of the worst-case scenario.

<h3>Britain Urges China to Pay Overdue Railway Loans</h3>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Simon replied to a question from Conservative MP Mullen in the House of Commons today, saying that the 790,000 pounds of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway loan that expired on July 1st, and the 2,182,000 pounds of the British portion of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway loan that also expired, have not been paid. British Ambassador to China Cadogan has repeatedly inquired with the Chinese government, and will continue to urge payment in the future. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Core Group of Disarmament Conference to Convene on the 20th of This Month</h3>
<p>Discussing Revision of Working Procedures</p>
<p>Points Where Compromise is Currently Hoped For</p>
<p>Separate Protocols Will Be Established First</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Secretariat issued a statement this afternoon signed by Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, stating that the discussion of the disarmament issue should be extended to after the beginning of next year. The statement calls for the Disarmament Presidium to meet during the special session of the League of Nations Assembly (scheduled to open on November 20). The Secretariat suggests incorporating certain issues that are expected to be agreed upon separately into protocols, which can be implemented separately without waiting for the Disarmament Conference to complete a convention. Examples include regulations on the arms trade, publication issues, and the establishment of a permanent disarmament committee. The statement concludes by saying that work on the aviation issue should begin as soon as possible. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, has sent a document to the representatives of the Presidium countries to revise the working procedures of the Disarmament Conference. The League of Nations Secretariat has now published this document, which states that when the Disarmament Conference passed the compromise proposal of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in early June of this year, it was decided to continue negotiations in order to establish a general disarmament convention. These negotiations were originally undertaken enthusiastically by former French Foreign Minister Barthou in a faithful manner. However, the assassination in Marseille occurred, and Barthou was tragically killed, causing these negotiations to be delayed. Given the situation, it is specifically suggested that the disarmament issue and the negotiations for establishing a general disarmament convention be postponed until the spring of 1935 before they are concluded. As for the points that have already been thoroughly considered, it is permissible to establish protocols in advance. The so-called points that have already been thoroughly considered are (1) the control and manufacturing of weapons; (2) the disclosure of military budgets; (3) the organization of a standing disarmament committee. In addition, the disarmament conference resolution in June of this year advocated the banning of state-owned aviation, but research has not yet begun on this level. This level is particularly important and should be reviewed as soon as possible. The Presidium is scheduled to meet on November 20. At that time, all members should express their opinions.

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Saar Situation</h3>
<p>Germany and France Take Cautious Measures</p>
<p>British Government Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>[London] When the British House of Commons discussed the tense situation in the Saar today, Foreign Secretary Simon replied to a question from opposition leader Lansbury, saying that the Saar Governing Commission is responsible for the security of the Saar. The Saar plebiscite is scheduled to be held on January 13 next year. This responsibility for maintaining order will still be borne by the Commission. The situation where the Saar Commission feels unable to maintain order should not occur. He believes that it will certainly not happen. The Saar Commission stated to the League of Nations Council as early as 1926 that the Commission had the right to convene troops on the border and nearby to assist in maintaining order when absolutely necessary. The League of Nations Council recorded this document. Any military action by France outside the Saar is purely precautionary. If the Governing Commission cannot fulfill its responsibilities and is forced to ask for assistance, then the use of foreign troops to maintain order is not a problem. As for borrowing British troops, it was not even mentioned.</p>
<p>The British Foreign Secretary also informed the House of Commons that the German Ambassador has confirmed today the reports that the German government has prohibited the Nazi stormtroopers and the Black Guard from wearing uniforms within 25 miles of the Saar border during the plebiscite. At the same time, the French Ambassador also stated firmly that there was no danger of invading the Saar region. Simon concluded, "I have expressed to the German and French ambassadors the British government's satisfaction with these statements. At the same time, I received a letter from the French Ambassador, stating firmly that France's preparations are purely precautionary. Under these circumstances, we can believe that the Saar plebiscite will be conducted in a stable situation with careful handling from all sides." (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Democratic Party Likely to Win U.S. Elections</h3>
<p>[Washington] According to a survey by the Associated Press tonight, the Democratic Party is still likely to hold a majority in Congress in the elections to be held tomorrow. The Senate side may gain four seats, and the House side may lose about 25 seats. It is worth noting that only four of the 47 states use the New Deal as a point of contention. These four states are Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, and Nebraska. The other states have praised President Roosevelt and his policies. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Election Tragedy</h3>
<p>Republicans Sniped at Democrats</p>
<p>Resulting in Four Deaths and Twenty-Two Injuries</p>
<p>Kieres, Pennsylvania: An election tragedy occurred in this small town today. Democrats held a campaign parade and were machine-gunned by the opposing party, killing four and injuring twenty-two. This massacre was the culmination of a conflict between local Democratic and Republican leaders. Five hundred marchers were demonstrating on the main street when, at a corner in front of Republican leader Bai Lunna's (phonetic transliteration) house, machine-gun fire suddenly erupted. Many marchers were hit and fell to the ground. Two people died on the spot, and two others died on the way to the hospital. Twenty-two people were injured, three of whom are not expected to survive. Local authorities could not cope and urgently requested assistance from the state troops. However, before the state troops arrived, the enraged miners attacked Bai Lunna's house but could not break in. Just as they were about to blow up the house, the state troops arrived, dispersed the crowd, stormed the house, and arrested 14 members of the Bai Lunna family, confiscating many weapons such as machine guns, rifles, and pistols. The town is now under de facto martial law, with state troops and local police patrolling the streets to prevent the crowd from carrying out lynchings. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>

<h3>Russian Ambassador Visits Guangtian Again, Negotiations on the Sino-Eastern Railway Become Deadlocked Again</h3>
<p>Japan Unwilling to Guarantee Payment of Railway Price</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Proposes New Plan for Types of Goods</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev met with Foreign Minister Hirota on the 6th. The talks centered on the issue of payment guarantees. Here is a record of the meeting: On the issue of guarantees, Ambassador Yurenev, based on the instructions from the Moscow government, repeatedly reiterated his previous position and demanded that Japan guarantee the payment. Foreign Minister Hirota also maintained his original position, so the two sides did not reach an agreement. On the issue of supplying goods, Ambassador Yurenev proposed a new plan regarding the types of goods, requesting that white rice, soybeans, barley, silk fabrics, machinery, and old ships be used as conditions. Foreign Minister Hirota promised to consider it further. On the issue of retirement bonuses for bureau staff, the Russian ambassador requested that temporary retirement bonuses be given to the retiring staff of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau. Regarding the issue of the period for supplying goods, the Soviet Union is now willing to concede to three years from the original two and a half years. Regarding the issue of consulates and other cultural facilities affiliated with the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet Union expressed some concessions. As for issues such as the property catalog and loan comparison table, the cause is that this party provided a reply. However, because the fundamental issue of payment guarantees was not agreed upon, the Japanese side did not provide a reply. Moreover, Foreign Minister Hirota was busy attending cabinet meetings, so the meeting was temporarily suspended and the two parted at 2:20 p.m. They will continue discussions at the next opportunity. (Japan United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Foreign Minister met with the Russian Ambassador for five hours today. It is reported that agreement has been reached on one or two issues regarding the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, no agreement has been reached on the various aspects of the Japanese government guaranteeing payment. Further talks will be held within the next few days. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Fate of French Cabinet Hangs in the Balance</h3>
<p>Refuses to Compromise with Premier Doumergue</p>
<p>Radical Party Cabinet Members Rumored to Resign</p>
<p>[Paris] It is widely expected that Herriot and other Radical Party cabinet members will resign this afternoon. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Doumergue cabinet is currently facing the possibility of a cabinet crisis. According to reliable sources, during the State Council meeting this morning, Minister without Portfolio Herriot stated that his political friends did not agree with Premier Doumergue's suggestion that voting in favor of the provisional budget bill should be regarded as supporting the constitutional reform bill. At that time, Premier Doumergue asked Herriot whether the Radical Socialist Party cabinet members would resign. After the Radical Socialist Party cabinet members left the meeting to discuss, they agreed to postpone the decision on whether to resign until the State Council meeting on Thursday morning. Therefore, the government will make a final decision on Thursday. Before that, the Radical Socialist Party parliamentary group will meet to discuss. If Herriot continues to reject Premier Doumergue's proposed procedure, the entire cabinet may resign. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>[Paris] According to reliable political sources, the political fate of Premier Doumergue will be decided at today's administrative meeting. Today's administrative meeting is chaired by President Lebrun. If the Radical Socialist Party cabinet members cannot compromise on Doumergue's policies, Doumergue will inevitably resign. Doumergue is also aware of this, so he has already drafted his resignation letter in preparation. The Radical Party in the Chamber of Deputies will meet this afternoon to discuss how to respond to Doumergue's constitutional reform bill. It is reported that there are only three options: (1) vote against Doumergue's reform bill; (2) abstain from voting; (3) allow each individual to act freely. If the last option is adopted, Doumergue's cabinet policy may gain the support of the majority. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Parliament Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Expressed Condolences for the Death of the King of South</p>
<p>Budget Bill Postponed Until Tomorrow for Discussion</p>
<p>[Paris] The State Council met this morning, chaired by President Lebrun. Premier Doumergue presented the draft of the speech to be read in the Chamber of Deputies in the afternoon. When the Chamber of Deputies met in the afternoon, the Speaker will present eulogies for the former King Alexander of Yugoslavia, the late Foreign Minister Barthou, and the former President Poincaré. Then, Premier Doumergue will read the speech, which will briefly state that no pain experienced by Europe has exceeded the tragic loss of the King of South. Alexander was a benevolent ruler of Yugoslavia, a true founding father, and a craftsman of peace. As for Yugoslavia, the people's calmness and solemnity can be regarded as a model. No matter who, they should provide assistance to the Southern Kingdom so that it can see the light. The conclusion is that although the King of South is dead, his policies are not dead. When Alexander passed away, he still cried out, "Save Yugoslavia quickly!" The people of France and the Southern Kingdom should always remember this sentence. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The French government's plan has changed again. Premier Doumergue's budget bill, originally scheduled for discussion on Wednesday, has now been postponed to 8 p.m. on Thursday. The reason is that a committee will be convened first on Wednesday. According to sources in Parliament, this delay is Doumergue's strategy to appease opposition to the constitutional reform bill, especially the Radical Socialist Party. Tomorrow, Doumergue will submit the initial draft of this reform to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies so that it can be discussed on that day. It is also reported that Doumergue will deliver a speech in the Chamber of Deputies on Thursday and ask the Chamber to hold a vote of confidence. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Internal Opinions of the Radical Socialist Party Differ</h3>
<p>[Paris] The French cabinet met this morning, and the Radical Socialist Party also held a meeting in the afternoon. There are new developments in the political situation. Premier Doumergue is determined not to easily abandon his position, acting as a pillar in the whirlpool of conspiracies and rumors. It is reported that Finance Minister 馬旦 (Madan, phonetic transliteration) does not agree with the Premier's approach of not dealing with the budget first and instead asking for funds, and he is unwilling to present this bill in the Chamber of Deputies. The Radical Socialist Party is divided into two factions: some are dissatisfied with the actions similar to a dictatorship, while others do not want to be responsible for the political turmoil that would occur if Doumergue resigned. Therefore, their steps may not be consistent. It is expected that there will be a major battle when the Radical Socialist Party meets this afternoon. Rumors are rife, and the stock market is sluggish. The people are suffering from political conspiracies and commercial instability, and they are becoming increasingly unbearable. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Veterans of the War Declare Confidence in the Government</h3>
<p>[Paris] Yesterday afternoon, a delegation from the National Federation of Veterans of the European War paid a visit to Premier Doumergue and expressed complete confidence in the policies led by the Premier. In addition, the United Federation of Veterans issued a declaration last night, recognizing the need to revive national authority, and also expressed support for the plan to submit the serious conflict between the Chamber of Deputies and the government to public opinion regarding the constitutional reform bill. However, regarding the extension of the validity of the budget bill by the government (Premier Doumergue argued that if the budget bill is not passed by both houses before January 1 of the relevant year, the government may extend all or part of the previous year's budget by order of law), it made a reservation, saying that "the power to approve the expenditure of public funds belongs to the representatives of the people." In addition, the United Federation believes that it is inappropriate for the Premier to include the civil servant protection clause in the Constitution. The conclusion of its declaration is that "the United Federation does not want to see France fall into extremes, but does not know the way to compromise. The so-called extremes are long-standing habits or the establishment of personal power." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Extreme Left Opposes Constitutional Amendment Plan</h3>
<p>[Paris] The orthodox Socialist Party parliamentary group met and unanimously decided to oppose Premier Doumergue's policies and his constitutional reform plan. As expected, the party decided to reject the government's request for a three-month provisional budget bill and appointed party members Blum and Frossard to represent the party and present their opinions when the Chamber of Deputies meets. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>French Minister of Commerce Postpones Trip to Moscow</h3>
<p>[Paris] Minister of Commerce賴穆爾 (Laimuer, phonetic transliteration) was originally scheduled to go to Moscow within days to negotiate with the Soviet government on the renewal of the French-Russian commercial treaty. However, due to the importance of the discussion of the provisional budget bill and the constitutional reform bill in the Chamber of Deputies, and the ongoing negotiations with Belgium on the cooperation of countries in the gold standard group, he has postponed his trip to Moscow. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Okada Decides to Convene a Special Diet</h3>
<p>One-Week Session Starting on the 27th of This Month</p>
<p>Plan to Reduce Public Debt Will Be in Vain</p>
<p>[Tokyo] As a result of consultations between Prime Minister Okada and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshida on the evening of the 5th, it was decided to convene a special Diet on November 27 for a seven-day session. After the cabinet officially decides on the 6th, it will be submitted to the Emperor for approval.</p>
<p>Since the Kansai wind disaster and other disaster relief budget proposals have been submitted by various provinces to the Ministry of Finance, Finance Minister Fujii plans to review them together with the basic budget. This disaster budget is calculated in the form of supplementary budgets for several years, such as fiscal year 9, fiscal year 10, or fiscal year 11, so it is difficult to separate the fiscal year 9 budget and submit it to the special Diet for review. The approximate amount of this budget is 120 million yuan for fiscal year 9, 150 million yuan for fiscal year 10, and 30 million yuan each year thereafter, totaling about 300 million yuan. Finance Minister Fujii has stated that he acknowledges 100 million yuan in the disaster budget and has decided on a policy to reduce public debt. It seems difficult to satisfy the relief for rural areas across the country.</p>
<p>The amount of public debt that the Ministry of Finance plans to issue in the next fiscal year is 604 million yuan, a decrease of 206 million yuan compared to the fixed amount of 810 million yuan in this fiscal year. However, various provinces will need to revive their original budget proposals, and disaster relief budgets also need to issue public debt, so the future does not allow optimism. Finance Minister Fujii plans to acknowledge 100 million yuan for the revival request, disaster budget, and delivery of public debt, so the deficit public debt issued for the revival request seems to reach more than 50 million yuan. The amount of public debt in fiscal year 10 is also close to 810 million yuan. According to the authorities' investigation, the existing amount of national debt at the end of September this year was 8,335,602,000 yuan, plus the planned issuance amount of 600 million yuan this year, 604 million yuan in fiscal year 10, and disaster and other budgets, which will reach almost 10 billion yuan. The government's plan to reduce the issuance of public debt will be in vain. (Japan United Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Authorities Search for Smuggling Case of Chinese</h3>

<h3>Real Situation of Disaster Relief in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Labor Relief Has Not Achieved Great Results</p>
<p>Agricultural Relief Begins to Be Implemented</p>
<p>Thousands of People Frozen to Death in Yangxin</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that this year's drought in Hubei Province is extraordinarily severe. The disaster area covers more than 90 million mu (Chinese acres), and the number of victims exceeds ten million. The phenomena of fleeing, suicide, looting grain, and robbery are heard everywhere. Because the government has established a Disaster Relief and Famine Prevention Committee and decided on engineering plans, 20 counties, including Wuchang, Echeng, Puji, Huanggang, Huangpi, Guangji, Huangmei, Yunmeng, Xiaogan, Yingcheng, Hanyang, Xianning, Jiayu, Huang'an, Macheng, Xishui, Qichun, Yangxin, Daye, and Jingshan, have given priority to setting up labor relief stations to implement labor-for-relief. Since the implementation, nearly three months have passed, and the suffering of the victims should have been slightly relieved. However, there are those who are burdened by receiving relief, which is a strange reversal of cause and effect. According to those who have come from the fields, this year's drought is severe, and people have no way to stay put. Before the government issued relief, the old and weak had already filled the ditches, and the strong had fled in all directions. When the labor relief personnel arrived in the counties, nine out of ten houses were empty. In order to complete the task, the labor relief personnel had to order the district and baojia chiefs to make a list of names and assign tasks such as digging ponds. Because many of the able-bodied men had fled, the district and baojia chiefs falsely filled out the rosters. By the time the work began, many could not report. Thus, people were arrested everywhere to do the work, as if they were capturing criminals. The people mistakenly believed that the government was conscripting labor, not providing relief, and fled again and again. In the end, the policy of benefiting the people turned into disturbing the people, which was completely beyond the government's expectations. As for opening granaries, this has also been implemented in many places. However, after the granaries were opened, most of the grain was moldy, probably due to the variety or moisture. Those who borrowed the grain could only weep. In addition, wealthy gentry in various places voluntarily opened their wallets to provide porridge, but there was little porridge for many people, causing them to fight with each other. The elderly, weak, women, and children still could not eat. Such things are too numerous to mention. In terms of agricultural relief, only more than 50,000 yuan has been allocated so far. Afterwards, the Rural Cooperative Committee, the Four Provinces Farmers Bank, the Rural Finance Relief Office of the General Headquarters, and the China International Famine Relief Commission will be entrusted to jointly handle the matter. It is still difficult to predict the results. Moreover, the government's price stabilization has achieved considerable results. It has now decided to open porridge kitchens to provide relief to the destitute. Li Huiwu, the administrative inspector of the second district and the magistrate of Yangxin County, recently telegraphed the province, stating that in only the sixth and seventh districts of the county, the number of victims who have frozen and starved to death has reached thousands. If one county is like this, others can be known. The main points of Li's telegram are recorded as follows: "The subordinate county has suffered from bandit disasters, followed by drought disasters. Houses are in ruins, and fields are scorched. The suffering of the people is difficult to express in writing. The sixth and seventh districts, which are adjacent to Wuru, have only recently been recovered. The strong have been slaughtered and coerced by bandits. The remaining people are either old, weak, or disabled. They cannot work to make a living, nor can they move far away to beg for food. They are trapped by hunger and cold, sitting and waiting to die. In recent months, the number of people who have starved and frozen to death in these two districts has reached more than a thousand. Such a tragic situation breaks the hearts of those who hear it and makes the eyes of those who see it water. In the blink of an eye, the end of the year is approaching and the weather is cold. If a way to provide relief is not urgently sought, I fear that countless victims will become the bones of starvation and freezing. I have previously requested approval to set up a refugee shelter in the county seat, but due to limited funds, there are not many people who can be accommodated, and the funds have been almost exhausted since August. I am worried and cannot sleep at night. I only implore your seat to bestow merciful clouds and allocate a large amount of relief funds so that it can continue to be managed." The current situation of the people in the disaster area can be seen from this. (5th)</p>

<h3>After the Remnants of the Jiangxi Bandits Crossed the Gan River and Fled Westward</h3>
<p>The Main Force of the Bandits Seems No Longer in Jiangxi</p>
<p>Many Bandits Killed and Wounded in Xinfeng and Nankang</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang states that the Red bandits in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian are collapsing step by step. Last month, the pseudo-Central Military Conference resolved to abandon the old nest and allow scattered bandits to lie dormant on the east bank of the Gan River and the Jiangxi-Fujian border to contain the National Army. Another large force was gathered to try to cross the Gan River and flee westward with all its strength. Before fleeing, they also feigned an attack on the front line of the Southern Route Army to create a smokescreen. In reality, the remnants of the pseudo-First Army Corps of Lin Biao, the pseudo-Third Army Corps of Peng Dehuai, the pseudo-Fifth Army Corps of Dong Zhentang, and the pseudo-Eighth Army Corps of Zhou Kun completely broke through Xinfeng and Nankang, and fled westward through Chongyi, Shangyou, and Suichuan. According to a recently announced message, after the bandits broke through Xinfeng, they set up pontoon bridges at Longhui, Jixian, and Nvbu, where Xinfeng, Nankang, and Dayu meet, and occupied Nankang. One group entered Chongyi from Qinglongxu, between Nankang and Dayu, and another group entered Chongyi from Yangmeisi, where Nankang and Chongyi meet. This is the left route of the bandits. The right route went from Zhongtangken and Dalongbu in Ganzhou to Suichuan and Shangyou. According to news from Ganzhou, more than 10,000 bandits who fled from Longhui on the 28th of last month entered the seventh district of Gan County. The purpose is unclear. It is confirmed that there are no bandit traces in Nankang County, but the pigs raised by the people in the places where the bandits passed have been slaughtered and eaten without leaving any. The bandits who crossed the river westward through Daxiao Wo in Xinfeng via Yangmeisi and between Chongyi and You kidnapped several good people from Li Zanliang's house in Wugong Township. The bandits who fled from Xiong Yu towards western Hunan were thwarted in Wujing and fled back again, fleeing westward through the area north of here. According to a responsible person in the military, Ganzhou's city defenses are solid. At the moment, the National Army's north, south, and west routes have been linked together. The bandits can be surrounded and annihilated in the Wanan, Suichuan, Chongyi, and Shangyou areas. The bandits in the Nanxin Yu area have been bombed into pieces. The bandits travel by night and hide during the day, carrying branches and straw on their hats, extremely panicked and embarrassed. (November 5)</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Promotes American Cotton</h3>
<p>Excellent Results This Year</p>
<p>Experience in Promotion in Qidong</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that Qidong in Shandong Province is a cotton-producing area. This year, the Department of Construction promoted the improved cotton variety No. 36, established cotton industry marketing cooperatives, and the cotton industry has become increasingly developed. More and more farmers are planting cotton. The soil for planting cotton is best suited to sandy loam. The soil along the Yellow River in Shandong is mostly sandy loam, which is quite similar to the lower reaches of the Mississippi and Negro rivers, which are famous cotton-producing areas in the United States. Therefore, it is also suitable for planting cotton, especially in Qidong. Unfortunately, over the years, old varieties and old methods have been used for cotton planting, and improvements have not been made. The quality of cotton has declined day by day. In 1922, American Kim's cotton seeds were transported to Shandong and scattered among the people. Cotton farmers called it local foreign cotton. In 1927, the Second Cotton Experiment Station was established in Qidong. Yang Shaoyun served as the director, and together with technician Hu Changzhun, they jointly researched and cultivated improved cotton varieties. In 1928, Yang Shaoyun died, and Hu Changzhun continued his work, collecting various cotton varieties and repeatedly experimenting with cultivation. By 1932, they had cultivated the improved Jiang cotton variety No. 36, which had the best quality. Initially, seeds were propagated at this station. In 1933, 4,000 catties of seeds were obtained. A portion was distributed to the Zouping Rural Construction Research Institute, and a portion was distributed to cotton farmers in Qidong for trial planting. It is estimated that 400,000 catties of improved cotton seeds can be obtained, which is enough for the whole county to plant cotton this year. When the new cotton went on the market, most of the cotton produced was purchased by ginning merchants. The cotton field only received 70,000 to 80,000 catties of seeds, which was not enough for the cotton farmers in this county. Therefore, No. 40 and No. 47, which had been cultivated, and No. 36-2, which had been bred, were used to supplement it. A total of 200,000 catties were sown this year. In order to prevent the loss of cotton seeds, the Department of Construction organized the American Cotton Marketing Cooperative in Qidong and was responsible for technical guidance, planning marketing methods, and providing loans to help the economy of cotton farmers. At the same time, China Cotton Historical Records established a large-scale ginning factory in Qidong. The cotton produced by the cooperative members was all collected at the ginning factory. The ginning factory ginned out the seeds and then sold them to the cotton factory to avoid the loss or confusion of the seeds. Since February of this year, Chen Shican, a technician from the Department of Construction, went to Qidong to start organizing the cooperative. The organization was completed in April, with a total of 153 societies, more than 4,800 members, and 33,000 mu of cotton fields. After the establishment of the cooperative, the government was only in a guiding position, teaching new technologies and assisting in marketing. The internal affairs and regulations of the society were determined by the members. The most important thing was that the seeds could not be changed without the consent of the society. Loans and sales were handled by the cooperative as a whole. Members could not sell to a certain factory or borrow from a certain party alone. The intention of the Department of Construction in handling the cooperative was not only to provide help and preserve seeds in terms of technology, marketing, and economy, but also to have a deeper meaning. Various foreign businesses have considerable organizations, and all administrative management and improvement and promotion are easy to handle. Our country has never had such an organization, and management is not easy. Therefore, organizing cooperatives makes it easy to start all promotion plans. This year's situation with American cotton, because it was initially dry and then rainy, cotton was greatly affected, and the harvest only accounted for 70% of previous years. Not only China is like this, but the whole world is like this. However, the output is already quite considerable, with the highest yield per mu reaching more than 300 catties, and averaging 200 catties, 7 million catties of cotton can be harvested. The Qidong ginning factory is currently purchasing at a price of 12 yuan and 7 jiao per 100 catties, which is worth about 900,000 yuan. It cannot be said that it is small to produce 900,000 yuan of cotton in one year, and the rural economy can also be adjusted. The income per mu is about 25 yuan or more, which is 8 yuan or more higher than planting grain. This year, there are 33,000 mu of cotton fields, which is an increase of 15,000 mu compared to last year. This 15,000 mu of land has increased revenue by 120,000 yuan compared to last year. The original 18,000 mu of land planted with cotton was changed to improved cotton varieties this year, and the revenue per mu increased by 3 yuan, for a total increase of 54,000 yuan. According to statistics, new and old cotton farmers can increase their revenue by 170,000 to 180,000 yuan this year. It is estimated that more people will plant cotton in the coming year, and the output will increase. The cotton seeds produced this year are estimated to be 500,000 catties of No. 36, 700,000 catties of No. 47, 40,000 catties of No. 36-2, and 50,000 catties of No. 40, for a total of 1.29 million catties. The provincial government has allocated a special fund of 32,000 yuan to purchase this cotton seed, which can purchase 160,000 catties at 2 fen per catty, preparing to promote it to the 12 counties designated as cooperative promotion areas next year. Qidong County will specialize in No. 36 alone, while the others will be distributed to the eleven counties of Zhangqiu, Qingcheng, Gaoyuan, Boxing, Putai, Bin County, Huimin, Gaotang, Xiajin, Linqing, and Qiuxian. This year, drought and flood are uneven, resulting in a 30% reduction in harvest, which is a rare phenomenon. Next year, the same number will be calculated. This 1.3 million catties of improved cotton seeds can yield 56 million catties of cotton, and those that do not use improved varieties are not included in this number. Cotton is suitable for planting when there is water when sowing and growing, but it is taboo to rain after flowering. The climate in Shandong has more rain in April and May, but not in August and September, so it is very suitable for planting cotton. However, this year has changed, with very dry conditions in April and May, and a lot of rain in September, so cotton was greatly affected, and the time for harvesting cotton was delayed by one month. Therefore, it is best to irrigate cotton by diverting water, not relying on rain from the sky. It can be controlled by humans. The success of siphon irrigation will be used in the cotton industry in the future and will have a great effect. Moreover, during the green gauze tent period, bandits rise up, and public security is most affected. In the future, there will be more cotton planters and fewer high-grain planters. Public security in cotton-producing areas can be easily maintained, which is also a secondary benefit of the cotton industry.</p>
<h3>Northwest Inspection Notes</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Petroleum and Coal Outside Jiayuguan</p>
<p>Jiuquan's mineral products include gold, coal, and asbestos (shaped like silk, elastic, white or greyish-green, soft as cotton, woven into cloth that cannot be burned, called "fire-resistant cloth"). However, gold mines and asbestos are no longer being continuously mined. The coal reserves are very large. Due to the need for fuel, locals still arbitrarily excavate it. The production areas are located on the northern slopes of the Qilian Mountains: Dahonggou, Xiaohonggou, Donggouliang, Dahuangou, and the Binggou area. Among them, the coal from Dahuangou is of the best quality. The other places like Dahonggou and Xiaohonggou emit a foul odor when burned due to excessive sulfur content. The daily output from all locations is approximately over two thousand catties. In the winter, when farmers are free, there are more people digging and the output also increases. At the production site, the price of coal is about 180 wen for every dou (approximately 35 catties), which is equivalent to 18 copper coins. Carried by ox carts and camels to the county seat, a journey of about 120 li (Dahuangou is 40 li further away), it only sells for 500-600 wen. If transportation were convenient, it could be transported and sold to other counties.</p>
<p>At 1 PM on the second day, we departed from Jiuquan. The west gate was not open, so we exited through the north gate and turned northwest. We soon crossed the Taolai River. The river water was flooding and the grassland was marshy, making travel difficult. Once we ascended the dry sand, although the bumps were severe, the road was quite straight. Looking out over the nearby suburbs, "Haibaibai" grass grew everywhere. The shape of its leaves resembles that of a cypress tree, and its texture is as succulent as amaranth, rich in salty taste, making it a top-quality forage. To the left, the snow-capped mountains, reliant on the heavens, were like jade tablets, glistening and sparkling in the sun, truly a spectacular sight. Before long, the carriage arrived at Jiayuguan, having traveled sixty li. It is located one thousand five hundred and twenty li southeast of Lanzhou, backed by the Black Mountain of Jiayu to the north, and relying on the Red Mountain of Qilian to the south. The fortress city is located in the middle, with its perilous nature formed naturally. However, there are few residents. Although the Sino-Russian treaty once opened the south port, the commercial center remains in Jiuquan. Furthermore, the fortress city is made of earthen construction, the border walls are collapsing, and there are paths through the mountains that could be used to attack the rear. Compared with Shanhaiguan, which relies on mountains and borders the sea, it is not as impressive. The inscription "The Mightiest Pass Under Heaven" seems excessive. Moreover, with the invention of modern firearms, warfare has advanced into three dimensions. Even if it were as grand as "The First Pass Under Heaven," if the defending soldiers are ineffective, the saying "geographical advantage is not as good as human harmony" still applies, and it would still be inevitably trampled by the iron hooves of imperialists. Passing through the pass, we entered a Gobi Desert, sloping downwards, covered with fine stones that appeared blue. Recalling the journey west from Lanzhou, Jiayuguan is almost a high point on a fish's spine, with the north and south mountain ranges converging and then spreading out again, greatly influencing the wind direction. There is a saying that "when it thunders at Jiayuguan, two meeting halls will fall in Hanzhong," which shows the variability and swiftness of the climate and wind force here.</p>
<p>Forty li west of the pass is Shuangjingbao, devoid of human habitation. It is said that there used to be many residents, all engaged in gold panning. Judging from the relics of the fortresses and courtyards, it seems likely. After another forty li, we arrived at Huihuibao and stayed overnight. This day's journey is commonly said to be one hundred and sixty li, but in reality, it is only thirty-seven kilometers, approximately equivalent to one hundred and ten li. The fort belongs to Yumen County and has over thirty households, mostly from the interior. Although there are inns, there are no food shops. Human habitation becomes even scarcer further west. There are no places to get supplies along the way, so it is necessary to bring dry rations and travel according to the stations to avoid sleeping in the wilderness. Near the fort, the fields are irrigated by the Baiyang River, and the harvests of millet, wheat, and poppies are all good. The river water is clear and does not freeze in winter. Ancient willows tower at the edge, and wild grasses sway. Land is reclaimed from the wilderness, and people cultivate it themselves, making it a small oasis outside the pass.</p>
<p>We departed the next morning (the third). We first passed through the Black Stone Gobi, undulating like waves, with many fissures and traps, commonly called "Nine Gullies and Eighteen Slopes, Three Steps Up and Two Steps Slide," which is quite a realistic description. Then, we saw two or three places with lush water and grass, very suitable for nomadic grazing. After about sixty li, we reached Chijinhu, which used to be a post station, but now it is just ruins and crumbling walls. Eighteen li later, we reached Chijinpu, with five or six households. There was a fork in the road outside the fort, but when we asked people, they all avoided answering. Suddenly, a postal runner arrived, and we learned that going left leads to Chijinbao, and going right leads to the main road to Yumen. After traveling a few more li, we passed a small soft sandy beach. To the left, we saw dense village trees and a lush green field, which is the old site of Yumen from the Tang Dynasty, now known as Chijinbao.</p>
<p>Ninety li southeast of Chijinbao, on the northern slopes of the Qilian Mountains, there is a river that abounds in petroleum, naturally seeping out onto the ground. During the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty, villagers entered the mountains to mine gold and passed by it, leading to its discovery. They tested it by lighting it on fire, and the flames blazed fiercely, so they named the place Shiyouquan (Petroleum Spring) and the river Shiyouhe (Petroleum River). They have been digging pits and scooping it up ever since. The Dusi Camp of the fort extracts two thousand catties of oil as a donation each year. In 1928, the Dusi Camp was abolished, and the donation was collected by the Jiuquan city defense army. The oil area covers approximately ten square li. In winter and spring, heavy snow does not melt, and the oil also congeals and does not flow. In the summer, when the water rises, the oil begins to seep out. Villagers scoop up the oil and put it in buckets, carrying it ashore, and then oil merchants (currently there are three) transport it to various places in large carts to supply the villagers for lighting or to grease the axles of large carts. The sales are limited, which shows that the quality of the oil is not very good. In the early years of the Republic of China, a certain Belgian and a certain German brought it to Shanghai for analysis, and they believed that the composition was excellent. Later, they requested permission to develop it, but the provincial government did not approve it. In the spring of 1929, the Gansu provincial government sent an expert, Zhang Renjian, to investigate and brought it to Lanzhou for analysis. It was found to contain 16.50% gasoline and 70.00% kerosene. In addition, about forty li east of the Petroleum River, eighty li south of Huihuibao, and forty li south of Baiyanghe Village in the Shiyougou area, covering an area of six or seven li, also produces petroleum, and the composition is very similar to that of Petroleum Spring.</p>
<p>Gasoline is a volatile oil, the most valuable component of petroleum. Ordinary petroleum is considered to be a high-quality oilfield if it contains 10% or more gasoline. The use of gasoline is extremely important. Modern civilized countries all use gasoline as the primary power to drive machinery. Some even use the abundance of petroleum production and reserves as a standard for estimating the strength and wealth of a country. Taking the development of transportation in Northwest China as an example, airplanes and automobiles all require a large amount of gasoline. The gasoline used by the Eurasian Aviation and Ganxin Automobile companies, stored in Su (Jiuquan), is all imported goods from Tianjin and Shanghai, with each box costing about 70 yuan, seven or eight times more expensive than in Tianjin and Shanghai. However, this only takes into account transportation costs, and the huge losses of about a quarter due to prolonged shaking, breakage, and evaporation during transportation are not yet included. To abandon oneself and seek others, to let the rights and interests flow out, and to discard goods on the ground, is it not painful? Now, the development of the Northwest has progressed from theory to reality, and the oil mining in Shaanxi has also achieved remarkable results. It seems difficult to allow this great source of wealth to be abandoned again.</p>
<p>Fifty li west of Petroleum Spring is Honggou, one hundred and twenty li north is Beiyao, and one hundred and fifty li south of Yumen County is Changma, all of which produce huge amounts of coal. Zhaobi Mountain, north of Changma, produces green copper ore, commonly known as malachite, which contains trace amounts of copper. If deep exploration and mining are carried out, a large amount of copper ore will surely be discovered. As for gold mines, they are abundant everywhere along the northern slopes of the southern mountains, whether they have been panned or not.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Prohibition Committee Reviews and Approves Opium Sales and Smoking Establishments</p>
<p>The County Opium Prohibition Committee has repeatedly issued orders to various districts, urging them to register opium smokers nearby in order to issue opium smoking licenses. As the deadline for obtaining licenses has passed, there are still a few who are waiting and watching, which hinders the prohibition policy. Therefore, the Committee has ordered the Public Security Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation. Anyone who smokes opium without a license, regardless of whether they have registered or not, should be severely punished in accordance with Articles 2 and 6 of the Regulations on Opium Smoking Licenses in Various Counties. Furthermore, there have been as many as 150 to 160 applications for registration to open opium sales and smoking establishments in this county. The Prohibition Committee, based on the proportion of opium smokers who have obtained licenses, reviewed them in conjunction with the four section chiefs and decided to approve the establishment of 37 establishments in the first district, 15 in the second district, 9 in the third district, 8 in the fourth district, 15 in the fifth district, 8 in the sixth district, 16 in the seventh district, and 4 in the eighth district. The Committee has issued a notice limiting those who are approved to pay the fees and fill out the forms within seven days in order to forward them to the provincial capital for the issuance of licenses.</p>
<p>County Government Holds Baojia Training Session</p>
<p>The county government recently decided to organize Baojia, based on Article 5 of the Schedule of Progress for Organizing Baojia in the Provincial Compilation of Laws and Regulations. It assembled district chiefs and assistant district chiefs as members of the organizing committee to hold training sessions, scheduled to be held on the mornings of the 8th, 9th, and 10th of this month, starting at 9:00 AM, and in the afternoons, starting at 2:00 PM, in the county government conference room. The training will cover the responsibilities of the district chiefs, the investigation of households, the significance of organizing Baojia, and the procedures for implementation. County Magistrate Jin has issued separate orders for compliance. It is reported that the county government has also selected and appointed Baojia organizing committee members for the eight districts in this county: Fei Fusheng in the first district, Qin Zhonghe in the second district, Zheng Junshan in the third district, Shen Shoutian in the fourth district, Wu Changding in the fifth district, Zhu Haoru in the sixth district, Shen Jusan in the seventh district, and Li Zengxin in the eighth district.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Extension of契税 Reduction for Another Three Months</p>
<p>The deed tax (契税) in this county was originally levied at 9% for sales and 6% for mortgages. From May of this year, it was reduced to 6% for sales and 3% for mortgages for a limited period of three months. Later, the deadline was extended for another three months, expiring at the end of October. It should have been terminated and the tax rate restored to 9% for sales and 6% for mortgages. However, this summer, there was a severe drought, and the autumn harvest was poor, causing economic hardship for the people. Due to previously established contracts, they were unable to pay the tax within the deadline. It has now been decided to extend the reduction of 6% for sales and 3% for mortgages for another three months, from November 1st of this year to January 31st of next year. For sales deeds, the total amount of tax and surcharges levied per hundred yuan of deed value is 8.3 yuan of silver, including 6 yuan of silver for the regular tax, 0.667 yuan of silver for the Zhongzi donation, 0.667 yuan of silver for the property donation, 0.666 yuan of silver for the construction donation, and 0.3 yuan of silver for the collection fee. For mortgage deeds, the total amount of tax and surcharges levied per hundred yuan of deed value is 3.9 yuan of silver, including 3 yuan of silver for the regular tax, 0.5 yuan of silver for the Zhongzi donation, 0.25 yuan of silver for the construction donation, and 0.15 yuan of silver for the collection fee.</p>
<p>Launch of Combined Ship and Train Tickets</p>
<p>The Jing-Hu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Hang (Hangzhou) Railway Administration had previously signed a contract for third and fourth-class combined tickets with the Louqin Shipping Bureau in this county. Recently, due to the poor performance of the shipping line, the Railway Administration terminated the contract and signed a contract with Qingyang Renji Shipping instead, with procedures scheduled to take effect on December 1st. The one-way fare from Taicang to Shanghai is 5.5 jiao (角) for fourth-class and 8.5 jiao for third-class. The shipping line runs from Qidun through Qingyang Port Station, Taicang, Shuangfeng, Zhitang, and Shaxi.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>All District Chiefs of the County Resign</p>
<p>The district chiefs of the autonomous districts in Wu County, due to being ordered to implement Baojia and having their expenses reduced by two-thirds, are experiencing great difficulties in their work. Five district chiefs, including Wu Erchang of the first district and Wang Shande of the second district, have successively submitted their resignations. County Magistrate Wu has retained them. Now, the district chiefs feel that there is really no solution to the financial problems, so they are determined to resign en masse. They have appointed Wu Erchang to draft the resignation letter, which they will all sign and submit to the county government tomorrow (the 8th). County Magistrate Wu has submitted this matter to the provincial office for instructions.</p>
<h3>Wu County Implements Regional Joint Defense</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Wu Qiyun of Wu County, in view of the recent repeated incidents of theft in various villages, causing unrest among the rural population, and with the imminent arrival of winter, deemed it urgent to prepare for winter defense to maintain security. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 5th, he convened the heads of the water and land police forces to hold a winter defense meeting. County Magistrate Wu chaired the meeting and reported the purpose of the meeting. It was decided to establish the Wu County Winter Defense Committee, and nine people, including Colonel Zhu of the Military Police Regiment, Colonel Ma of the Engineering Regiment, District Chief Zhou of the Second Water Police District, County Magistrate Wu, and Chief Wang of the Public Security Bureau, were appointed as standing committee members. November 15th was set as the start date for the winter defense, and the winter defense period was tentatively set for four months. The entire county was divided into five major security zones, with a winter defense office established in each zone.</p>
<h3>Baoshan</h3>
<p>Repeated Disputes within the Party, Public Organizations Request Serious Handling</p>
<p>The Baoshan County Party Headquarters, due to repeated disputes, was ordered to cease operations in the summer of this year. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters appointed Wang Bingyi as the custodian, and the matter came to a temporary end. It is now heard that the provincial authorities plan to restore Baoshan Party affairs and will appoint Zhu Xuedian and others as organizing committee members. Upon hearing this, the Baoshan County Education Association, the County Farmers' Association, and other public organizations believed that Zhu's daily behavior was improper and that he had been dismissed by the authorities for corruption in handling civil education affairs. If he were to be appointed to organize Baoshan Party affairs, it would inevitably lead to renewed disputes. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed the Provincial Party Headquarters, requesting a serious handling of the matter. The party members in various districts of the county also jointly submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, listing the causes and consequences of the repeated disputes in Baoshan Party affairs over the years, requesting that they be carefully considered to avoid further disputes.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Police Station Chief and All Officers Taken into Custody</p>
<p>The firearms of the former Public Security Branch Bureau of Loutang Town were borrowed from the local area. After the branch bureau was reorganized into a police station, Patrol Chief Ye Rongchun transferred the loan receipt for continued use. In the middle of last month, a C96 pistol and a handgun, placed in the station, suddenly disappeared. Despite a thorough search, they could not be found. Patrol Chief Wu reported the situation to the County Public Security Bureau. Bureau Chief Chen Youmin ordered that the case be solved within a time limit. As the deadline passed without any progress, Bureau Chief Chen believed that the loss of firearms at the station was not due to any special circumstances and was obviously stolen by the internal police officers. The day before yesterday, he personally led seven police officers to the town and took Patrol Chief Ye and fourteen police officers of the station back to the bureau for detailed interrogation. He also transferred Chief Gao of the bureau and six police officers to temporarily take over the station.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Jiang Minsheng Comes to Wuxi to Give a Speech</p>
<p>Jiang Minsheng, a major general in the Northeast Volunteer Army who resists Japan, is originally from Wen County, Shandong Province, and is currently 39 years old. He has recently been touring various places to give speeches. He arrived in Wuxi from Suzhou the day before yesterday to contact the County Party Headquarters, the Education Bureau, and others to arrange speeches and distribute printed propaganda materials. The content is alarming and moving, and he is vigorously promoting domestic goods. It is reported that Jiang plans to stay in Wuxi for a week and then go to Beijing, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Hubei, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other places to give speeches.</p>
<h3>新民报 Reporter Suffers Abuse, Fellow Journalists Hold a General Membership Meeting to Provide Assistance</h3>
<p>Pan Yuyi, a reporter for the Xinminbao newspaper in this county, was accused of fraud for paying a fine on behalf of someone. He was arrested and detained by Zhang Yu, the director of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and Fan Shouchi, an officer of the bureau. He was sent to the headquarters and transferred to the court for questioning. However, when Pan was detained at the detention center of the First Branch, Director Zhang stripped him of his outer clothing and forced him to endure the cold all night. When Pan was escorted to the headquarters by the bureau, Zhang again ordered the chief police officer to tie him tightly with hemp rope and drive him through the streets. Upon hearing this, all the members of the Journalist Association of this county believed that since Pan's alleged crime had been transferred to the judiciary, they could quietly await the handling of the case according to the law. Moreover, the alleged fraud was not comparable to major cases of murder and theft. They unanimously expressed their indignation at Zhang Yu's abuse of power. At the same time, based on Pan Yuyi's report of being illegally abused, they requested assistance. The association held a general membership meeting at the Railway Hotel at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than twenty members attended, including Shi Jilin, Chen Hongjun, Sun Chunpu, Zhang Xiongliang, Sun Xiangfeng, Zhang Suichu, and Xu Xiyin. Sun Dexian chaired the meeting. The following matters were resolved: (1) Ratification of the decision of the Standing Committee to suspend Pan Yuyi's membership; (2) Sending a letter of inquiry to Zhang Yu; (3) Submitting petitions to the county government and the Public Security Bureau to remove Zhang Yu from office and investigate his case; (4) Engaging three lawyers, Sun Zuhong, Zhou Beiwu, and Tang Ying, to jointly study the legal issues involved in this case.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Gunfight with Bandits at Nanzhang Bridge</p>
<p>At around 12:00 AM on the 3rd, three bandit boats suddenly arrived in Nanzhangjia Bridge, a village belonging to the Third District. The boats, which had come from Huadang, carried approximately 20 to 30 bandits, all armed with long guns. After reaching the town, they disembarked, intending to loot the entire town. Three or four bandits first guarded the north and south ends of the town. Fortunately, the sentry of the Liantang Security Corps noticed the bandits disembarking. Seeing the crowd, they ran to the Corps headquarters to report, and an emergency assembly was immediately called. However, the bandits seemed to have noticed, and they immediately opened fire to resist arrest. The Corps soldiers then hid in the fields and returned fire. The two sides exchanged fire for thirty minutes. The residents of the area, hearing the dense gunfire, knew something was amiss and got up to sound the gongs. The bandits, realizing that they were outnumbered, boarded their boats and fled back towards Huadang. In the end, there were no casualties on either side, but an elderly woman surnamed Bu in the village was hit by a bullet and seriously injured. She has now been sent to Wuxi for treatment.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Embezzlement Case in the County's Field Tax Office</p>
<p>The county government's Field Tax Office has previously experienced embezzlement through internal and external collusion. Chen Ruizhang, the former director of the Field Tax Office, resigned due to opium addiction. Chen Jingxin replaced him as acting director. Regarding the embezzlement, County Magistrate Bao convened representatives from various agencies to discuss and appointed auditors to investigate. After more than a month of investigation, a portion of the grain records were audited, and embezzlement amounting to over 3,000 yuan was discovered. The unaudited portion is likely to be even greater. Yesterday (the 5th) at around 5:00 PM, County Magistrate Bao, believing that the employees of the record room had embezzled state taxes, immediately ordered Zhang Rui, the captain of the First Company of the Security Corps, to detain He Jishi, Zhao Zhen, Jiang Jiuyu, Zhai Guangying, and Zhai Baozi, five employees of the internal record room and the external record room. At around 9:00 PM, Gu Wenhua, the chief of the Second Section, interrogated them. Two employees of the external record room, Zhai Yongkang and Zhai Shaopeng, had already fled upon hearing the news. The county ordered the police to summon Wang Yu, the owner of Jubao, the owner of De Tang Xi Hao, and Wang Xunyuan, the owner of Tai He Tang, to the station, ordering them to hand over Zhai Yongkang and others within a time limit. The case is now expanding significantly. The county government must also report it to the Department of Finance and appoint a commissioner to thoroughly investigate it to clear up the accumulated malpractices in the field tax system.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Bandits Loot Villages in Shangdang</p>
<p>Earlier this month, at approximately 10:00 PM, more than ten bandits broke into the home of Luo, a resident of Shangdang Qingjiang Taiwan. Each was armed with long and short guns. Two of them, holding short guns, pointed the gun barrels at Luo's wife and daughter-in-law and ordered them not to make any noise or they would be killed. At that moment, the two women were frightened and did not dare to make a sound, allowing the bandits to search for about an hour. The bandits took all the valuable belongings in the house, worth several thousand yuan, and fled.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Association Establishes Affordable Rice Distribution Centers</p>
<p>Due to the sharp rise in rice prices, which has greatly affected the livelihoods of farmers in various rural districts, the Zhenjiang Drought Relief Committee, in addition to actively preparing for work relief and disaster relief to provide assistance, has decided to start affordable rice distribution early. It plans to establish affordable rice distribution centers in various rural towns and markets. One has already been established in Huangxu, and Director Yin of the Rural Improvement Committee has come to the town to collect 4,000 silver dollars to establish one center each in Huangxu Town and Xinfeng Town, in accordance with the Committee's original decision, to assist poor farmers in general.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>County Orders Preparation for Land Reporting</p>
<p>The county government previously ordered all districts to prepare land reports and to submit detailed plans for reporting on屯田 (government-owned farmland) for review and approval. It also instructed all township chiefs to carefully study the method of copying and compiling cadastral registers, to estimate the number of sections in each township, and to report back for review. However, at that time, the districts were busy with the Huai River drainage project and could not attend to it. Now that the Huai River drainage project is nearing completion, the county government yesterday specifically ordered the district chiefs to supervise and urge the township chiefs to actively prepare for the land reporting work and to study it in detail. Once the budget rules and regulations are approved, they must convene township chiefs for training and begin the process.</p>

<p>News of the Construction of the Huaiyin Ship Lock Project</p>
<p>The淮委會 (Huai River Commission) is constructing a ship lock at Yangjiazhuang South Zhong Matou in Huaiyin, concerning the project to connect the 裏运水 (Li Canal) with the water of the river. Construction began this spring. The riverbed is 15 meters deep, and the distance between the banks is about 100 meters. The canal extends from Yangzhuang in the north to the 裏运 (Li Canal) in the south, with a total length of more than one里 (Chinese mile). Currently, in addition to a portion of the workers transporting stone and materials, more than 100 are taking care of the machinery and driving piles, engaging in the repairing and construction of the lock foundation. Each pile is more than two丈 (Chinese feet) long and about three尺 (Chinese feet) thick. There are six pile-driving machines working day and night. Engineer Wang Yizeng and Deputy Engineer Yin Chengsan are permanently stationed at the construction site to supervise the progress. According to them, if the lock foundation project continues to work day and night at the current pace, it will be completed soon. In any case, the lock project will be completed before the flood season next year.</p>
<p>Two Kidnapping Cases Outside the City, Noted</p>
<p>On the evening of the second day, six or seven bandits suddenly came to Yadian Lane outside Huaiyin City, Hebei, and kidnapped Xu Hongjun, the manager of the Wansheng Pig Farm in the lane, and Xu Yongqing, who was in charge of the disaster relief station. At the same time, in Hongfuzhuang, a village outside the dike, bandits came to the home of Hu Kaiyu, a villager, each carrying long and short guns. They forbade Hu's family from making a sound. Then, they searched all the rooms and found Hu Kaiyu's sixteen-year-old son and Hu Kaiyu's nephew, who was only ten years old. The bandits grabbed both children and left with shouts. After the incident, although numerous security police inside and outside the dike pursued them, they did not know where the bandits had gone.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>British Minister Leaves for Beijing After Visiting</p>
<p>The British Minister to China, Sir Miles Lampson, accompanied by the Deputy Consul and Secretary from Beijing, arrived in Hangzhou at 3:00 PM on the fourth day by car along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway to visit. They stayed at the Xiling Hotel. On the fifth day, they visited various scenic spots in West Lake. Yesterday (the sixth) at 8:30 AM, they returned to Beijing by car along the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway. The city government specially sent a representative from the tourism department to bid farewell. Mr. Lampson said that he had a very good impression of Hangzhou on this visit.</p>
<p>Hongyu Cloth Shop Suddenly Liquidates</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the economic downturn in recent years, closures of large and small stores have been frequently heard in Hangzhou. Last month, Kaitai Cloth Shop suddenly announced liquidation, owing depositors approximately 370,000 yuan. Creditors have been negotiating with the manager of the shop, Li Jintang, to repay the debts, but no solution has been reached. Unexpectedly, Hongyu Cloth Shop in Qinghefang also announced liquidation yesterday. The shop has been in business for 60 years, with annual sales of approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. In recent years, sales have decreased to approximately 200,000 yuan, resulting in significant losses. Manager Liu Zixing entrusted a lawyer to announce liquidation. It is reported that the amount owed is 250,000 yuan, including approximately 200,000 yuan to silver shops. There are not many depositors. Currently, there are approximately 60,000 yuan in goods and 70,000 yuan in accounts receivable, which are insufficient to repay the debt of approximately 120,000 yuan. After receiving the report, the city government sent personnel to join the City Chamber of Commerce to thoroughly investigate the business accounts and ordered the shop manager to submit a detailed explanation of the reasons for the liquidation.</p>
<p>Borrowing Boxer Indemnity Funds to Develop Jiang-Zhe Fisheries</p>
<p>Zeng Yangfu, the Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction, previously borrowed funds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to build the Qiantang River Bridge. Later, the Ministry of Railways joined the collaboration, and the project expenses were shared equally by the ministry and the province, so funding was secured. Therefore, the loan of 130,000 pounds sterling, equivalent to more than 2,100,000 Chinese dollars, has been decided to be jointly borrowed by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for the development of fisheries in the two provinces. The Boxer Indemnity Committee has approved it.

<p>Sun Qinggan's Home Suddenly Suffers a Major Burglary</p>
<p>Sun Qinggan, the manager of the Ruifeng Silk Weaving Factory in this city, was recently reported for smoking opium and was summoned by the court to the detention center for investigation. Sun's home is located in Andingshu Lane. Unexpectedly, several burglars armed with凶器 (dangerous weapon) broke into the house by climbing over the wall the night before last. Because the women were alone at Sun’s home, they dared not speak out and let the intruders ransack the house and pry open the safe, stealing a large sum of money. Yesterday morning, Sun's wife, Madam Li, reported to the detective team for investigation and petitioned various agencies to investigate and arrest the criminals. It is reported that the loss was very large, but the number is unknown because Sun is in the detention center for investigation.</p>

<h3>### Details of the "Jiahe" Steamer Robbery in Shantou Waters</h3>
<p>Pirates' Goal Was a Large Sum of Money</p>
<p>Frustrated, They Kidnapped Crew Members</p>
<p>One Maritime Policeman Killed, One Wounded</p>
<p>The "Jiahe" steamer, a Shanghai-Xiamen-Shantou liner of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was robbed by pirates in Shantou waters on the 4th of this month while sailing from Shantou back to Shanghai. One maritime policeman was shot and killed, and one was wounded. Three people, including the business director, were kidnapped before the pirates left. Yesterday's report briefly mentioned the telegram. Further details are as follows:</p>
<p>Transporting Funds to Xiamen</p>
<p>The Xiamen branch of the Shanghai China Industrial Bank also has banknotes in circulation. In order to replenish its cash reserves, the bank negotiated with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on October 29th to transport 300,000 silver dollars to Xiamen. Each box contained 5,000 silver dollars, totaling 60 boxes. They were loaded onto the ship at the Jinliyuan Wharf. The most numerous other goods were soybean cakes, about 10,000 several thousand pieces, followed by wheat flour, about six or seven thousand bags, and the rest were textiles, cigarettes, and other items. The company, considering the large amount of money on board, did not take on passengers, hence the journey from Shanghai to Xiamen was very safe. On the 2nd of this month, the ship arrived in Xiamen, and the money was unloaded and the cargo and passengers were cleared. Then, the ship set off for Shantou.</p>
<p>Pirates' Misunderstanding</p>
<p>After the "Jiahe" arrived in Shantou, it loaded passengers and cargo on the 4th and set sail north to Shanghai. However, the Dapeng Bay pirates have informants stationed at important ports throughout the country, who specialize in gathering information about ships' itineraries and whether they carry valuables, in order to commit robberies. This time, the "Jiahe" transported funds from Shanghai to Xiamen. The pirates mistakenly believed that the funds were being transported from Shantou to Xiamen or Shanghai. Therefore, twelve pirates disguised themselves as passengers on the 4th and infiltrated the ship, waiting for an opportunity to rob it. It is known that the "Jiahe" is already 41 years old and is not a regular passenger ship, so it was not equipped with iron grilles. Only six escort team members were assigned, each given weapons, to protect the ship.</p>
<p>Robbery in Shantou Waters</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM on the 4th, the "Jiahe" set sail from Shantou. There were only a few dozen third-class passengers on board. At 9:15 AM, the ship arrived at the Tai Sarni Point in the Dashanmian Cape waters, only 50 li away from Shantou. The pirates on board started the robbery. The head bandit fired a shot as a signal, and the other eleven pirates responded simultaneously. First, they put the captain, Sha Zengjia, and the radio operator, Chen Guoxiong, under surveillance. Then, they drove the first and second officers and other crew members into a room and forced the captain to change direction and sail towards Haifeng. At this time, the entire ship was under the control of the pirates. The crew had lost their ability to resist and had no choice but to obey them.</p>
<p>Maritime Policeman Killed</p>
<p>The maritime police on board heard the gunshots and knew it was a robbery. They immediately plotted resistance. However, the pirates had paid attention to this when they boarded the ship, so they struck first. Before the maritime police could draw their guns, the pirates opened fire. One maritime policeman was shot and killed on the spot, falling to the ship's deck. Another maritime policeman was also wounded by the pirates. The other maritime police did not dare to move again and were disarmed. Even the self-defense weapons in the captain's room were taken away.</p>
<p>Search and Robbery</p>
<p>The pirates' goal was the 300,000 silver dollars. Therefore, when they robbed the ship, they first detained the business director, Shen Qinxiang, and the treasury official, Li Shaobing, and ordered them to hand over the money. Shen and others handed over the cash stored in the treasury, but had no other large sums of money to hand over. The pirates still did not believe them and ordered them to hand over the keys to the cargo hold and open the cargo hold. After the pirates searched carefully and confirmed that there was no large amount of cash, they realized that the 300,000 silver dollars transported from Shanghai had already been unloaded in Xiamen. The pirates then expressed their disappointment. According to statistics, the pirates' search and robbery on the ship lasted from 9:00 AM on the 4th to 6:00 AM on the 5th, a total of 22 hours.</p>
<p>Kidnapping of Crew Members</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, the ship, under the control of the pirates, sailed towards Honghai Bay, east of Haifeng. Along the way, the pirates seized a fishing boat to use for their escape. When they reached Honghai Bay, the pirates disembarked onto the fishing boat and left. Before leaving, because they had robbed so little, they kidnapped the ship's business director, Shen Qinxiang, the treasury official, Li Shaobing, and another cargo clerk. After the pirates left the ship, the captain, Sha Zengjia, released the detained people, repaired the engine, and withdrew from Honghai Bay, sailing towards Xiamen.</p>
<p>Report to Shanghai</p>
<p>The ship's wireless radio had been damaged by the pirates, so the authorities could not be notified immediately when the pirates left. It was not until 7:00 AM yesterday morning that the Shanghai office received a telegram from Sha Zengjia, which briefly stated: "Our ship set sail from Shantou at 7:00 AM on the 4th. At about 9:00 AM, when the ship arrived at Shantou, it was robbed by twelve pirates. One member of the ship's escort team was shot and killed by the pirates, and one was wounded. The pirates forced our ship to sail to Honghai Bay, east of Haifeng. Before leaving, they kidnapped one business director and two cargo clerks. The ship is now sailing towards Xiamen." The telegram was very brief and did not mention the amount of losses.</p>
<p>Families Inquire</p>
<p>After reading the newspaper and learning about this incident, the families of the crew members in Shanghai rushed to the headquarters yesterday morning around 10:00 AM to inquire about the truth. The most anxious were the families of the business director, Shen Qinxiang, the treasury official, Li Shaobing, and the cargo clerk, who all wanted to ask about the names of those who were kidnapped. However, the company only knew the names of Shen and Li and did not know the details. They had to comfort them with kind words and promise to investigate by telegram. Only then did they disperse.</p>
<p>Request to Apprehend Pirates</p>
<p>After receiving the report, Liu Hongsheng sent a telegram to Zhu, the Minister of Transportation of the Nanjing government, yesterday, requesting him to forward it to the Ministry of the Navy, and to telegraph the authorities of Fujian and Guangdong provinces, requesting them to send troops and police to cooperate in the arrest of the pirates and rescue the three kidnapped crew members. The company also directly telegraphed the Xiamen Naval Command and the Guangdong Navy, requesting them to send warships to intercept the pirates, in the hopes of capturing them. At the same time, they telegraphed Xiamen, ordering the "Jiahe" to return to Shanghai as soon as possible. Yesterday, it was heard that the British destroyer HMS "Visham" had sailed to Shantou and Honghai Bay to assist in the pursuit of the pirates.</p>
<p>Arrival Tomorrow</p>
<p>After the pirates left, the "Jiahe" first went to Shantou, sent a telegram to Shanghai, and then left Shantou for Xiamen. The ship's wireless radio is currently being repaired by Chen Guoxiong along the way. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai office received a telegraph from Xiamen, stating that the "Jiahe" had safely arrived in Xiamen. After loading some goods, it immediately set sail back to Shanghai. It is expected that the ship will arrive safely in Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 8th. All losses will only be known after the ship arrives. As for the maritime police who were killed and wounded by the pirates, the deceased will be properly buried after the ship arrives in Xiamen, and the wounded will be sent to a hospital in Xiamen for treatment. It is heard that the company will provide them with considerable compensation.</p>

<h3>Jiang Bocheng Postpones Trip to Guangdong for a Few Days</h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reported that Jiang Bocheng, a member of the Ping Army Branch, was ordered by Chairman Chiang to be stationed in Guangdong to liaise on military affairs for the suppression of bandits. He was previously summoned to Zhengzhou to meet Chairman Chiang. After returning to Shanghai, he originally planned to take the Changxing Company's "Empress of Japan" steamer to Guangdong this morning. However, due to other important matters, he decided to postpone his departure for a few days. It is rumored that he will go south with Huang Shaoxiong, the Minister of the Interior. According to Jiang's associates, this statement is untrue, because Jiang's mission is limited to military and political matters relating to the suppression of bandits and he has no other mission.</p>

<h3>Mao Yisheng Talks About the Start Date of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge</h3>
<p>The groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled for the 11th of this month in Hangzhou</p>
<p>The total construction cost is set at 4 million yuan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Construction Department will cooperate to complete it in a year and a half</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Construction Department are preparing to build the Qiantang River Railway Bridge. It has now been decided that the groundbreaking ceremony will be held in Hangzhou on the 11th of this month, and work is actively underway. In terms of funding, the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Construction Department will each bear 2 million yuan, for a total of 4 million yuan. The project is expected to be completed in about a year and a half. At that time, east-west traffic in Zhejiang will be connected, and the railways will be connected and operated together, which will greatly benefit the development of industry and commerce. Our reporter interviewed Mao Yisheng, the director of the Qiantang River Bridge Engineering Office, last night. The details of his conversation are as follows:</p>
<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony Scheduled for the 11th</p>
<p>According to Mao, the groundbreaking ceremony for the Qiantang River Railway Bridge has been set for the morning of the 11th of this month in Hangzhou. Invitations will be sent to people from all walks of life in Beijing and Shanghai to attend. The invitation cards will be co-signed by the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Construction Department. It is hoped that the Shanghai press will send personnel to Hangzhou to participate.</p>
<p>Total Cost of 4 Million Yuan</p>
<p>As for the total cost of the project, the initial funding included 1 million yuan from the National Economic Commission, 2 million yuan borrowed by the Shanghai Banking Group, and £160,000 allocated by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund. However, now that the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Construction Department have decided to cooperate, it has been decided that each will bear half of the total cost, that is, the Ministry of Railways will raise 2 million yuan from the Sino-British Bank and the Construction Bank, and the Zhejiang Construction Department will still borrow 2 million yuan from the Shanghai Banking Group, for a total of 4 million yuan. The Ministry of Railways has appointed Counselor Xia Guangyu as its representative, and the Zhejiang Construction Department will be represented by Director-General Zeng Yangfu.</p>
<p>Budget Exceeded, Joint Planning</p>
<p>The initial budget for the entire project was indeed 5 million yuan, but now, after bidding, it has been proven that it will not exceed 4 million yuan. In the future, if the bridge is completed and the tracks are connected at both ends, if the funds are insufficient, both parties will be responsible for planning.</p>
<p>Bridge Foundation Engineering is Solid and Permanent</p>
<p>The bridge foundation engineering is divided into two parts. On the Zhabei side, the six piers are constructed using caisson method. On the Xixing side, the nine piers are constructed using piling method, with a length of 100 feet driven in. The entire bridge has sixteen spans, each with a distance of 220 feet. The entire project is expected to be completed in about a year and a half. The engineering will strive for solidity and durability, and will definitely not last only three or five decades. Mao concluded by saying that the office will have a formal written report with details of the project, and hopes that it can be disclosed in the newspapers before the groundbreaking ceremony on the 11th.</p>
<h3>The International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestically Produced Products</h3>
<p>Tung Oil, Silk Cocoons, and Woolen Fabrics</p>
<p>Manufacturers can contact the Bureau</p>
<p>Germany Needs Our Tung Oil</p>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau, tung oil is a special product of China, and the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei have the largest output. In recent years, remote areas in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanxi have also gradually planted and manufactured oil. Chinese tung oil has always been praised by paint manufacturers in Europe and America. Tung oil has the characteristic of drying quickly and can be used as a raw material for paint. To date, there are no other vegetable oils that can replace it, so exports have increased year by year, and it has a significant position in international trade. The Czech Biedma Industrial Company and the German Mr. Dossig have written to request tung oil. It is hoped that all tung oil exporters will notify the Bureau so that they can be introduced.</p>
<p>Czech Republic Willing to Manage Our Silk Cocoons</p>
<p>Also, Adam &amp; Co. of the Czech Republic has written to express its willingness to manage and promote Chinese silk cocoons and woolen fabrics. Manufacturers who wish to promote their products to that country are requested to notify the Trade Bureau at No. 1040, Beitu, New Garbage Bridge.</p>
<h3>French Minister Weilitun Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon After Vacation</h3>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, French Minister to China Weilitun has returned to the country on vacation to report to the French government on the situation in China and to seek instructions on the signing of the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty. He has now completed his vacation and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 1:00 PM this afternoon on the French Mail Line's "Pattenam" steamer. The steamer will dock at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Central Wharf.

It is understood that after arriving in Shanghai and resting briefly, the French Minister will go to Beijing to meet with Foreign Minister Wang to continue discussing the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty. The treaty had been in contact with our diplomatic authorities several times before the French Minister returned to his country, and results have been obtained except for the appendix. This time, the French Minister asked to return to his post to continue negotiations. This long-standing unresolved case should be resolved. As for the date of the French Minister's trip to Beiping, it will be decided after he arrives in Beijing to meet with our diplomatic authorities.</p>

He will not stay in Shanghai when he passes through. He is expected to leave Hong Kong at the end of the month and return to Shanghai early next month, and then go north to Beiping.</p>
<h3>"Wuyang" Steamer Has Been Rescued</h3>
<p>Stranded Until the Night of the 3rd</p>
<p>The "Wuyang" steamer, which was stranded outside Dashigang, was heavily loaded and deeply drafted, and its hull was deeply mired in the shallows. The shipowner repeatedly tried to reverse the engine, but failed to escape the danger. After three days and three nights, it was towed out by a ship sent by the Guangzhou branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company when the tide rose. Fortunately, the area was a sandy beach and there were no stones or reefs, so although the ship was stranded for a long time, the bottom of the hull was not greatly damaged. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to Shanghai saying that it could load cargo and leave Guangzhou for Shanghai immediately.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bonds Have Been Printed</h3>
<p>Exchange Will Begin from Yesterday</p>
<p>Entrusted to the Bank of China</p>
<p>The 3.5 million yuan of Shanghai Municipal Bonds issued in 1934 were underwritten by the American Anderson &amp; Co. After public subscription, they were sold out. Now that the bond certificates have been printed, Anderson &amp; Co. has entrusted the Bank of China to exchange them. The bank issued a special announcement yesterday, stating that the municipal bonds have now been printed. Those who hold temporary receipts from the bank are requested to exchange them for formal bonds at the bank's trust department starting from the 6th of this month. This is a special announcement.</p>

<h3>Hunan Fellow Association Submits a Letter of Petition for Relief</h3>
<p>The Hunan Fellow Association in Shanghai submitted multiple letters and telegrams to the central government, the National Government Relief Committee, and various ministries and commissions yesterday, seeking relief for the drought in Hunan Province. More than a thousand letters were sent to charitable organizations in various places, Hunan Fellow Associations in various places, charitable organizations in Shanghai, public legal entities, newspapers, and fellows. The letter stated: "It has only been two years since the Xinwei flood, and the local vitality has yet to recover, and the people's breathing has not yet settled. However, there is also an unprecedented drought in more than 60 counties this year. Not only are remote mountain villages in despair of the autumn harvest, but even the counties that are known to be relatively fertile have no grain harvest. The old and weak are in the ravines, and epidemics are spreading, with cries reaching hundreds of miles away, as cruel as entering the eighteenth hell. Refugees are scattered, with tears falling down. It is our unavoidable duty to open the granaries and request grain. Our association respectfully appeals to all charitable people and gentlemen in our country. We beg you to have mercy on these remnants and provide prompt relief. Even a grain or a thread is enough to save a person's life. It is more than just repaying the kindness by tying grass or carrying a ring in our mouths. If all the kind people from all walks of life donate money and goods for relief, please send them directly to the Hunan Drought Relief Committee in Changsha for inspection and receipt, in order to be simple, straightforward, and prudent. Our association respectfully thanks all the disaster-stricken people in Hunan on their knees. We express our words with tears, hoping for universal relief. We respectfully wish you good fortune. We cannot express our gratitude. The Hunan Fellow Association in Shanghai respectfully bows, Standing Committee Members Zhou Zhenlin, Ye Kaixin, Chen Jie, Huang Yi'ou, Shen Zunuo, Chen Heting, and Li Zhi."</p>
<h3>Famine Victims in Haining Eat Barnyard Grass to Survive</h3>
<p>Some Use the Seeds of the Stink Tree as Food</p>
<p>Most Self-Sufficient Farmers Are Not Eligible for Relief</p>
<p>This year's disaster in Haining is extraordinarily severe, and the tragic situation has only recently become fully apparent. Although the Shanghai Haining Drought Relief Association has been working hard to raise funds and has requested assistance from the Jisheng Society, the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, the Bodhi Benevolent Society, and the Red Swastika Society to jointly carry out emergency relief efforts, reports from those who have returned to Shanghai from the disaster area indicate that the majority of villagers have reached a point where they have nothing to eat. They are gathering barnyard grass seeds from the fields, which are commonly found in rice paddies and are usually sifted out and discarded, but in times of famine, they are considered a superior food source. In the Yuanhua Town area of the Third District, bordering Haiyan, people are even gathering the seeds of the stink tree (Ailanthus altissima), which resemble chestnuts and are thus known as "wild chestnuts." In the past, these were used as firewood or to feed pigs, but even the pigs did not like to eat them. Now, they are being used as food for people. What is even more ridiculous is that when the Third District Public Office was reviewing the list of disaster victims, they ordered all the village police officers to gather at the office and ask each household if they had any grain. Those who owned three or four mu of land were not eligible for relief. As a result, the average self-sufficient farmer, who has no harvest this year and is suffering as much as the tenant farmers, is being treated very differently from the tenant farmers when it comes to receiving relief. It is said that the district originally reported over 110,000 disaster-stricken households, but after a closed-door review, regardless of the severity of the disaster, the list was drastically reduced, leaving only twenty-odd thousand. As a result, a large number of disaster victims are still without relief. Next year's rice seeds are already gone due to this year's lack of harvest, and even those who have a small amount left are struggling to survive in the present and have nothing to spare. Therefore, seeds have also become a problem. The time to the next harvest is at least half a year away, and only public works projects can alleviate the urgent needs of the disaster victims. It is said that the association has realized that this year's drought was caused by the high terrain and riverbeds, which prevented water from the west (such as the Tiaoxi River) and the east (such as the Mao River) from flowing in. The severe drought lasted for four months, almost cutting off the drinking water supply. Now that relief is not a short-term matter, it is fortunate that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has allocated 11.1 million yuan in public bonds specifically for public works projects in the disaster area. The association has submitted a detailed report to the provincial government, requesting the allocation of funds to carry out public works projects to improve water conservancy and save the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Recent News on Jisheng Society's Relief Efforts in Haining</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society, recognizing the severity of the drought in Haining, is jointly carrying out emergency relief efforts with the Sino-Foreign Relief Association and the Haining Drought Relief Association. Yesterday, they received a report from Director Li Yunmen in Shanghai, stating that the disaster situation in the county is extremely serious. A preliminary investigation of the Fifth District found 17,800 households, each with anywhere from five or six to seven or eight members, totaling a large number of people. The limited relief funds available are insufficient to meet the needs, and more funds are urgently needed. The report also mentioned a lack of relief workers and requested additional personnel. In response, the Jisheng Society has added three relief workers, Fan Shoumin, Yin Shunzhang, and Shi Kelong, who departed today. Regarding the request for additional relief funds, the Society is facing a shortage of funds and is unable to provide immediate assistance. They are currently making urgent appeals, hoping that benevolent individuals and organizations will come to their rescue. Saving even one life is an act of great merit, and the true rewards are immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Magistrate Luo Zhongda of Chongde County Comes to Shanghai to Beg for Relief</h3>
<p>Luo Zhongda, the magistrate of Chongde County in Zhejiang Province, came to Shanghai yesterday to beg for relief from all sectors of society, as the disaster situation in his area is extraordinarily severe. A reporter from the New Voice Newspaper met with Magistrate Luo at his lodging yesterday. Luo said that the county has a total of 290,000 mu of paddy fields, of which 210,000 mu have been affected by the disaster, with 73,000 mu having no harvest at all. The Fourth and Fifth Districts are the worst affected, with 40,000 and 89 extremely poor people on the verge of starvation if not rescued, and another 26,000 somewhat poor people. Disaster victims from the Fourth District are carrying baskets and walking sticks, begging for food along the roads. Robberies are rampant, and grave robbing and coffin looting are common sights. If relief is not provided urgently, they will all freeze and starve to death. He has come to Shanghai to beg for relief from the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, the Zhejiang Drought Relief Association, and the Red Swastika Society to help the tens of thousands of disaster victims in his county who are suffering in dire straits.</p>
<h3>Fellow Villagers of Luhe County in Shanghai Establish a Drought Relief Committee</h3>
<p>Luhe County in Jiangsu Province has suffered an extraordinarily severe drought this year, leaving farmers with no harvest. Fellow villagers of Luhe County in Shanghai, including Dong Xiujia, Xia Yizhai, Huang Zhong, Chen Lingyi, and Li Huating, have established a Drought Relief Committee for the county. The following is the original text of their announcement appealing for donations: "Respectfully announcing, Luhe suffered a drought in 1929, followed by a flood in 1931. In 1932 and 1933, droughts and floods occurred frequently, reducing harvests. Combined with low grain prices, the people's suffering has not been alleviated, leaving nine out of ten households empty and the rural economy bankrupt. This year, since the beginning of summer, there has been no rain at all. Rivers have dried up, and ditches and ponds are empty. Beans sprouted and withered immediately, and rice seedlings withered before planting. No grass is green, and the entire land is desolate. Luhe is a remote and barren area in northern Jiangsu, and it cannot withstand repeated disasters. After the autumn harvest, there were occasional showers, and farmers managed to borrow money to buy mung beans and buckwheat, planting them as much as possible, hoping to salvage some of the harvest. However, before the seedlings emerged, they were damaged by insects. Those that were not damaged by insects were subjected to more than ten days of continuous rain, causing the roots to rot. There is no hope for a new harvest, and there are no old reserves. Luhe is divided into seven districts. Except for a small area of polder fields along the river in the southeast corner of the Third District, which had a slight harvest, the remaining six districts, bordering Tianchang and Lai'an in Anhui Province, and Jiangpu in this province, have become a desolate wasteland with no harvest. Residents, seeing that there is no hope for survival, have left their homes and scattered in all directions. Those who have no way to make a living and no way to find food have become starving refugees on the roads, a sight too tragic to bear. Some have gone without food for days, unable to get a full meal, and have closed their doors and committed suicide. It is heartbreaking to hear. We, who live in Shanghai, have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from our hometown begging for relief, and we feel the pain deeply. Although we have tried our best to raise funds, our capabilities are limited, and it is a drop in the bucket, insufficient to solve the problem. Furthermore, the future is long, and winter is approaching. If we do not quickly seek relief, the dying refugees will face starvation and freezing, and all will perish. We humbly implore all benevolent individuals and philanthropists to have compassion and fulfill their generous wishes, donating grain and contributing money to save our disaster victims, so that they may escape death and be reborn, and all will be grateful for your kindness. As the saying goes, 'Saving one life is better than building a ten-level pagoda.' Your great kindness will bring immeasurable merit. We, the members of the committee, bow our heads nine times to beg for the people of Luhe."</p>
<h3>Chinese Cigarette Industry Requests Cancellation of Cigarette Surtax in Shaanxi Province</h3>
<p>Shaanxi Province Heavily Imposes a 40% Surtax</p>
<p>Telegraphic Request to the Tax Bureau to Forward a Letter of Cancellation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Industry Association received a telegram from the Xi'an Cigarette Industry Association in Shaanxi Province, stating that the Shaanxi Provincial Government has heavily imposed a 40% surtax, making it unbearable. They requested assistance, so a representative, Mr. Li Xinle, arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd and immediately went to the Cigarette Manufacturers Association. He was received by Chairman Shen Weiting. Representative Li explained his purpose and requested prompt assistance in sending telegrams to various parties, requesting that the 40% surtax be cancelled. Chairman Shen immediately agreed to send telegrams to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau, requesting the cancellation of the tax. The representative was satisfied and left to return to Shaanxi to report back. The association yesterday sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Bureau, requesting that they forward a letter to the Shaanxi Provincial Government to quickly cancel the surtax to alleviate the difficulties faced by businesses. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Tax Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette Manufacturers Association, in response to a telegram from the Shaanxi Tobacco Industry and the request from representative Li, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau yesterday, stating: "Respectfully informing, we recently received a telegram from the Xi'an Cigarette Industry Association, which said, 'To the Shanghai Cigarette Industry Association, the Shaanxi government is heavily imposing a 40% surtax, which exceeds the regular tax by 64 yuan for Grade 1 cigarettes and 32 yuan for Grade 2 cigarettes, causing business to be sluggish and hardship to be extreme. Such a heavy tax burden is unsustainable. Therefore, we have sent Mr. Li Xinle as a representative to present our case, and we respectfully request your consideration and ask the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to jointly assist in petitioning the Ministry of Finance to order the reduction or exemption of the surtax in order to comply with the central tax regulations, thereby alleviating our suffering and maintaining the status quo. Respectfully awaiting your reply.' The Xi'an Cigarette Industry Association bows eastward," and so on. We have found that once cigarettes have paid the unified tax, they can be circulated domestically. Now, the Shaanxi Provincial Government is heavily imposing a 40% tobacco tax, which is actually a violation of the unified tax regulations. Businesses are struggling and cannot withstand the burden. Therefore, we are writing to your bureau, requesting that you promptly send a letter to the Shaanxi Provincial Government to cancel the heavy tax imposition as soon as possible, in order to maintain tax revenue and alleviate the difficulties of businesses. (Omitted) We extend our public friendship to the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau."</p>
<p>Letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce</p>

We extend our public friendship to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Telegram to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to Shao Lizhi, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, requesting the abolition of the heavily imposed cigarette surtax in Shaanxi Province. The original text is as follows: "To Chairman Shao Lizhi of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, on the 5th of this month, we received a letter from the Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association, stating that they had received a telegram from the Xi'an Cigarette Industry Association, which said, 'The Shaanxi government is imposing a 40% surtax, which exceeds the regular tax by 64 yuan for Grade 1 cigarettes and 32 yuan for Grade 2 cigarettes, causing business to be sluggish and hardship to be extreme. Such a heavy burden is unsustainable,' and so on. After deliberation, we have found that once cigarettes have paid the unified tax, they can be circulated domestically. Now, the Shaanxi Provincial Government is heavily imposing a 40% tobacco tax, which is actually a violation of the unified tax regulations. Businesses are struggling and cannot withstand the burden. In addition to writing to the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau, requesting that they send a letter to the Shaanxi Provincial Government to cancel the heavy tax imposition as soon as possible, in order to maintain tax revenue and alleviate the difficulties of businesses, we are writing to your chamber, respectfully requesting that you consider the plight of businesses and promptly send a telegram to the Shaanxi Provincial Government, requesting that they allow the cancellation of the heavy tax imposition as soon as possible, in order to lighten the burden and maintain business. We extend our public friendship, etc.' After the meeting, it was found that under the current unified tax system, all products from each factory, after paying the unified tax according to regulations when they leave the factory, can circulate throughout the country without being taxed again. Various provinces have separately added surtaxes under the name of local taxes, which have been repeatedly prohibited by ministerial documents and published in the Ministry of Finance's Tax Gazette. Your province has many things to be done, and tax revenue is insufficient, which is also well known to our chamber. However, according to the aforementioned situation, the Shaanxi tax surcharge is extremely heavy, and businesses cannot bear it. Although cigarettes are consumable goods, they are also under the umbrella of the national unified tax system, and the treatment should not be too different. Moreover, the cigarette unified tax is a major source of income for the national treasury, and the source of tax revenue should also be taken care of. In addition, the livelihood of the factory workers is also a concern, which should be taken into account. We hope that you will carefully consider how to balance the situation so that manufacturers in Shanghai can have a chance to catch their breath. We sincerely hope that you will grant us your full consideration and properly handle the matter. We would be extremely grateful. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce bows in song."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bar Association Fetes Mr. Escarra</h3>
<p>Advocates Adopting Laws Based on Justice and Reason</p>
<p>Last night, the Shanghai Bar Association hosted a banquet at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road in the Public Concession for Mr. Escarra (transliteration), a Frenchman and former member of the Beijing Law Codification Committee who was recommended by the League of Nations as a legal advisor to the National Government. New Minister of Justice Ju Juesheng, his specially appointed secretary Hu Chishan, and Zhang Yaozeng, Dong Kang, Li Shirui, Sun Zuji, and others were also invited. All members, including standing committee members Shen Junru, Chen Tingrui, and Wang Weizhen, executive supervisors Yan Yinwu, Hu Jue, Li Ming, Wu Kaisheng, Zhu Fuju, Yang Zhihao, Zhou Xiaoan, Zhang Zhengxue, Guo Shouyi, and Ma Junshuo, warmly received the guests. The party entered at seven o'clock, and the atmosphere was filled with toasts and lively conversation. During the banquet, the guests discussed the state of the judicial system in China. The gathering ended around nine o'clock, with both hosts and guests thoroughly satisfied. Excerpts from the speeches given by standing committee member Shen Junru and Mr. Escarra are as follows: (1) Standing committee member Shen said, "Today, our association is hosting a banquet for Mr. Escarra. We are very honored to have Mr. Escarra grace us with his presence. Mr. Escarra has studied Chinese characters and ancient Chinese jurists, and he holds our ancient laws in particularly high regard. However, many of those in our country who discuss law often disregard our traditions. Now, the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China has discovered the Chinese legal system, and Mr. Escarra happens to be a scholar of ancient Chinese law. He can be considered a pioneer of overseas research in this area. We are very fortunate that Mr. Escarra will soon contribute his research findings to the world." (2) Mr. Escarra said in his speech, "I am very grateful to the Shanghai Bar Association for this banquet today. Since 1924, I have been helping China in a very simple way as an advisor. I have great respect and affection for China. China is a vast and resource-rich country. I believe that the creation of a new society through the compilation of modern legal codes requires careful observation to ensure they are truly applicable. I hope that the doctrines of Confucius will still be incorporated in modern laws, which may conflict with Roman law. There is no such drawback to adopting laws based on justice and reason. If there are matters that cannot be reconciled, there are interpretive systems that can be used to remedy them. I hope that your association will continue its efforts in the field of law. I wish you all good health." Zhang Yaozeng, Wu Kaisheng, Li Shirui, and others also gave speeches, which are omitted for brevity.</p>

<h3>Five Gunshots Fired at Zhoujiaqiao in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Zhu Xingtai's Home Robbed</p>
<p>One Thief, Wang A'san, Captured</p>
<p>Zhu Xingtai, a 53-year-old man from Changzhou, residing at No. 2358 Jeesfeer Road, Zhoujiaqiao, in western Shanghai, runs a reed mat shop and has some savings. Around 8 p.m. the night before last, Zhu had just finished dinner when three thugs suddenly broke into his home. Two of them wielded handguns, creating a menacing atmosphere and forbidding anyone to make a sound. Zhu, realizing that they were robbers, ran outside and shouted for help to catch the thieves. The thugs, seeing that things were not going well, fired five shots with their handguns, but fortunately no one was injured. At that moment, Liu Guoshu, an officer from the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau, was patrolling the area with his colleagues when he heard the alarm. They rushed to the scene and bravely fought to arrest the thugs. One of them was apprehended on the spot, and two spent cartridges were also recovered. They were immediately taken back to the bureau. After Bureau Chief Wang Dasui interrogated them, the plaintiff, Zhu Xingtai, provided a statement of the previous events. The captured thug identified himself as Wang A'san, a 29-year-old man from Yancheng, residing on Xinmin Road in Zhabei. He stated that he and the two fugitives had gone to Zhu's house, not to rob, but because someone surnamed Liu had a deep grudge against Zhu and instructed them to go there with guns to assassinate him, which is why they failed to hit him. After obtaining the confession, the bureau chief ordered them to be held for further investigation and interrogation.</p>

We hope you will take note of this matter."</p>
<p>Letter to Hu Wenhu</p>
<p>The Committee sent a letter to overseas Chinese leader Hu Wenhu yesterday, saying, "Mr. Wenhu, we have long admired your charitable heart and enthusiasm for public welfare. We were honored to witness your presence in Shanghai during the recent festival. Your excellent reputation is universally admired, and we wish you good health and longevity. Respectfully informing, since the September 18th Incident, various sectors of society have been stirred by righteous indignation and have risen up to participate in the nation-saving movement. During the January 28th Incident, they joined the citizens' volunteer army, fought on the front lines, and engaged in passive resistance after the settlement by warning unscrupulous merchants and sacrificing everything to demonstrate the spirit of our nation. Members of the Patriotic Martyr Society, including Pan Hongsheng, were arrested and subjected to torture to extract confessions, resulting in internal injuries. They were released on bail in critical condition, but medical treatment was ineffective, and he passed away at 5 a.m. on the 3rd of this month. Our association mourns the martyr's loyalty to the country and his commitment to the public good. His work remains unfinished, which cannot but make us sad. The martyr's family includes an elderly mother with white hair and a blind elderly father, and they are destitute. In order to commend his honor in life and grief in death, the association has established a funeral committee to handle his funeral and burial and provide for his family, and to erect a monument for a public burial to express our sorrow and commemorate him. This is a major undertaking that requires a great deal of funds. Therefore, we have appointed Chen Binghui and Chen Jiufeng as representatives to visit you. We hope that you will grant us an audience and provide guidance. We know that you are a leader in the industry and will surely appreciate the meaning of saving the country through domestic goods, support the patriotic movement, commend the martyr, and contribute generously to comfort his soul and encourage those who come after him. We are deeply moved and hopeful. We respectfully inform you of this matter and wish you well."</p>
<h3>The Wu Futang Descendants' Sisters-in-Law Resolve Property Dispute</h3>
<p>Appeal Permitted to Be Withdrawn</p>
<p>Following the successive deaths of Wu Xingsheng and Wu Meisheng, brothers and descendants of the deceased shareholder Wu Futang of Ruikang Paint Shop, their sisters-in-law, Wu Xu and Wu Bao, engaged in litigation in the First Special District Local Court over the inheritance of over two million in ancestral property. According to Wu Xu's petition, all of the ancestral property was in Wu Bao's possession, and she requested a judgment ordering Wu Bao to hand it over for equal distribution. However, Wu Bao countered, arguing that Wu Xu was merely a concubine of Xingsheng and had no children, thus lacking the standing to contest the inheritance. Furthermore, Xingsheng had been dead for fourteen years, and the statute of limitations had long expired. Following the initial trial by the court, it was determined that the plaintiff, Wu Xu, had no grounds for her lawsuit, and the case was dismissed. Wu Xu, dissatisfied with the judgment, retained lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. She presented various reasons for disagreeing with the original judgment, citing legal precedents to support Wu Xu's right to demand a share of the inheritance, and requested the reversal of the original judgment. The Second Branch of the High Court, upon receiving the appeal, summoned both parties for questioning and advised them to seek an out-of-court settlement to avoid prolonged litigation. The parties have now reached an agreement through the mediation of relatives. The appellant, Wu Xu, has accepted the terms of the settlement and abandoned her claims. Yesterday afternoon, the scheduled date for the continued hearing, her lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun appeared in court and declared the circumstances of the out-of-court settlement, requesting permission to withdraw the appeal. Presiding Judge Li Dong approved the request, bringing the case to a close.</p>
<h3>New Life Hospital's Morphine Production Case Adjudicated</h3>
<p>Individual Sentences Handed Down</p>
<p>Qian Baiyan, also known as Mian, a doctor from Zhenjiang, age twenty-five, established the New Life Hospital at 799-801 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. He secretly partnered with Zhang Sen, a Ningbo native currently at large, to set up a morphine production operation in the vacant second and third floors of the hospital. They illicitly manufactured and sold morphine, reaping substantial profits. On the morning of the fifth of last month at nine o'clock, French police officers, including Chief Inspector Lambert, Inspector Li Yaolong, Detective Zhang Daorong, and patrolmen Liu Jinrong and Shen Jinshu, discovered the operation and raided the premises. They confiscated manufacturing equipment and arrested Qian, along with accomplices Lu Xianglong, Li Asan, Yang Xing, and suspects Zhang Jinfu, Zhu Huaming, and Zhang Ziwei, totaling seven individuals. They were handed over to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer prosecuted them under Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law for manufacturing narcotics. The details of the trial have been reported in previous newspapers. The case has now concluded its inquiry. Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the First Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought to court. Qian Xiangyan was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and fined one thousand yuan for assisting in the manufacture of opium substitutes. Lu Xianglong was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and fined eight hundred yuan for assisting in the manufacture of opium substitutes. Li Asan and Yang Xing were each sentenced to one year and six months' imprisonment for assisting in the manufacture of opium substitutes. Zhang Jinfu, Zhu Huaming, and Zhang Ziwei were found not guilty. During the appeal period, Qian, Lu, Li, and Yang were remanded to the detention center. Zhang, Zhu, and Zhang, who were acquitted, were required to provide a three thousand yuan bail, guaranteed by a shop, to ensure their availability for future summons. Qian Baiyan's defense lawyer stated that Qian was currently detained in the hospital and had various matters that still needed to be settled. He also requested permission for bail. The judge stated that a cash bail of fifteen thousand yuan was required for him to be released on bail. After the announcement, the police escorted the defendants back to detention.</p>
<h3>Old Painter Accused</h3>
<p>Li Xiujin Files Suit for Abandonment</p>
<p>Old Painter Absent Due to Illness</p>
<p>Cheng Yaosheng, also known as Dezhang, a renowned calligrapher and painter from Anhui, once enjoyed great prestige. His fees for each fan painting would reach tens of gold coins. Now approaching seventy years of age and blind in both eyes, and possessing considerable wealth, he abandoned his career in calligraphy and painting and rented a residence at No. 9 South Anli, Xinzha Road. Recently, however, Li Xiujin (age eighteen), a woman from Changzhou, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Criminal Court, accusing Cheng of abandonment. The substance of her complaint was that at the age of seventeen, she was introduced to Cheng as his wife by Yang Ren, a colleague of Cheng's from the Jiheng Pawnshop in Changzhou. They initially resided in places such as Muqiaotou in Changzhou. The following year, she gave birth to a son named Rongguan, who soon died. Subsequently, Cheng accompanied the plaintiff to Shanghai, where he pursued calligraphy and painting. However, the couple's relationship deteriorated, and when the plaintiff was thirty-three years old, Cheng engaged in illicit relations with a Wuxi maidservant, openly cohabiting with her at home. As a result, the plaintiff was subjected to beatings and abuse. To protect her life, she separated from Cheng and temporarily resided at the Guangfu Temple on West Heng Street in Changzhou. This has been the case for over ten years. Initially, Cheng provided some expenses, but for the past five years, he has not provided any living expenses. The plaintiff sent a letter of inquiry, but Cheng denied that she was his wife and demanded proof. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit requesting that he be punished under Article 310 of the Criminal Code for abandonment and demanding that Cheng, who possesses assets of hundreds of thousands of yuan, provide her with a one-time payment of fifty thousand yuan. The Special District Court approved the lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Feng Shide opened the First Criminal Court to conduct the hearing. The defendant, Cheng Yaosheng, was absent and was represented by lawyer Ma Nangeng, who stated that Cheng was unable to attend court due to illness and that a settlement of the case was possible, so he requested a postponement. The court questioned Li Xiujin about the events. She testified as described above, adding that the defendant now denies that she is his wife. In addition to the original matchmaker Yang Rensheng, there were wedding invitations at the time which are being sought from her hometown. When residing in Yongnianli, Baker Road, famous painters Wang Yiting, Zheng Xiaoxu, and Wang Yiting's son Shaomei often came to visit and could be called as witnesses. Judge Feng, noting the defendant's absence, ruled that the case could not proceed and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Special District Rickshaw Merchants Petition the Municipal Council; Reply Given Yesterday</h3>
<p>Merchants Dissatisfied; to Petition Again Today</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, rickshaw merchants in the Special District, protesting the illegal and excessive fines imposed by the Rickshaw Committee, the violation of Chinese law by forcing rickshaw pullers to register, and the compulsion to replace rickshaws with new models, petitioned the Municipal Council the day before yesterday. The authorities instructed them to await a response yesterday. Therefore, representatives Jin Chunlin, Wang Kun, Qiu Jilang, Shi Shaoan, Hua Zhongfeng, Bao Zhenhuang, Zhao Rongfu, Lu Yuzhai, Yin Zhifang, Wang Runtao, and others, totaling ten individuals, went to the Municipal Council at ten o'clock in the morning. They were again received by He De Kui, the Director. He De Kui replied with the following: (1) The Municipal Council will first test the new regulations on rickshaw owners. If the results are unsatisfactory, modifications will be considered. (2) Efforts will be made to allow the continued use of existing old-style rickshaw bodies. At four o'clock in the afternoon, the rickshaw merchants of the Special District held another temporary meeting, attended by over three hundred people. Chairman Jin Chunlin reported the results of the petition. After discussion, it was generally agreed that the replacement of rickshaw models and the registration of rickshaw pullers violated the resolutions of the Board of Directors and the approval of the Equal Rights Association. In order to respect the Municipal Council's position, the rickshaw merchants decided to acknowledge the validity of the resolutions. They stated that they would continue to oppose the Rickshaw Committee if it disregarded the hardships of rickshaw owners and pullers. As a result, ten representatives were selected to report to the Municipal Council and petition again today.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Cables Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Strictly Prohibit Grave Robbing</h3>
<p>To Curb Banditry and Secure the Homeland</p>
<p>The Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai cabled Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the Nanchang Headquarters yesterday, stating: "To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanchang Headquarters, we have repeatedly received reports from fellow villagers in Yin County, Zhenhai, and other places, stating that recently, with the construction of roads and fortresses in these counties, workers from other provinces have entered the area in large numbers. Thugs have infiltrated among them, causing disturbances everywhere. These people move in and out of the mountains and forests, even taking advantage of people's unpreparedness to rob old and new graves. The local people, intimidated by their violence, dare not speak out and have no choice but to ask our association for assistance from afar. Therefore, we respectfully request you to immediately cable the military and political leaders in charge, strictly ordering their subordinates to earnestly restrain the workers, conduct thorough investigations, and punish offenders according to military law, in order to curb banditry and secure the homeland. We eagerly await your response. Yu Hede and others of the Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai respectfully kowtow."</p>
<h3>Record of Conversation with Mrs. Tao Aider, President of the American Red Cross</h3>
<p>China Needs Peace and Time</p>
<p>Mrs. Tao Aider, President of the American Red Cross and Executive Committee Member of the China Child Welfare Association, arrived in Shanghai some days ago and has been warmly welcomed by various circles, as reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, Chen Zhengfan, an officer in the Education Group of the China Child Welfare Association, visited Mrs. Tao Aider at the Cathay Hotel for discussions. During the conversation, Mrs. Tao made the following remarks and requested that they be published in Shanghai newspapers:</p>
<p>I personally feel deeply ashamed and grateful for the generous treatment I have received from all parties during this visit to Shanghai. In Shanghai, I have many friends and relatives, and I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity to meet and converse with them. My husband, Mr. John Alan Tao Aider, was formerly the American Naval Attaché in China, and I resided in China with him for over twenty years. Therefore, I have a profound impression of China and a strong sense of connection. This time, revisiting this old place, I feel that everything has the atmosphere of flourishing, and China's child welfare事业, under the leadership of President Kong Xiangxi of the Child Welfare Association, is showing leaping progress. In the past few days, I have visited the Child Welfare Association's education and care home, nursery, clinic, and the activities organized by the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association, and I am very satisfied with them all. I firmly believe that the culture of any country depends on the footsteps of children, so I have a great interest and faith in the child welfare business of China and the United States. I deeply wish to contribute my meager efforts, bit by bit. The intellectual women of China have now stepped into a new stage, no longer confining their vision and energy to the small family sphere. It is a gratifying phenomenon that they also know to come out and serve the society and the country. The Shanghai YWCA and the Chinese Women's Temperance Association provide suitable dormitories for the general working women of Shanghai, with clean bedrooms, beautiful reception rooms, entertainment rooms, and reading rooms, offering comfort and safety, so that women who work far from home can enjoy the pleasure of feeling at home and avoid wasting money and adapting to the environment. Their contribution is so great that it is unnecessary to mention. What China needs most today is peace and time. All old ideas, old habits, and old systems that violate modernization must be destroyed one by one, and all new ideas, new habits, and new systems that are suitable for modernization must be built one by one. Then China can become a modern country and occupy a place on the modern world stage. The World Red Cross Conference held in Tokyo, Japan last month lasted for fourteen days, with representatives from the Red Cross Societies of sixty countries attending. The results were quite satisfactory. The next conference is scheduled to be held in Madrid, the capital of Spain, in 1938. I sincerely hope that the Chinese Red Cross can also send representatives to attend at that time.</p>

<p>China Child Welfare Society Sends Representatives to Welcome Her</p>
<p>Lady Muiel Paget, the former president of the British Child Welfare Society, has been traveling abroad for several months. She arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 11:30 AM on the Empress of Japan. The China Child Welfare Association dispatched Deputy Director-General Chen Qinsheng to the wharf to welcome Lady Paget, in recognition of her donation of a large sum of money through her daughter, Mrs. Zhang Xuelou (currently an executive committee member of the China Child Welfare Association), during the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, for the rescue of orphans in the war zone, demonstrating her compassionate heart and deserving of admiration. The association will hold a grand welcome reception in the near future.</p>
<h3>Road Association Seeks Recent Developments</h3>
<p>Large-Scale Organization of Salt Affairs Team</p>
<p>Since the opening of the China National Road Construction Association's membership recruitment, the officers of each team have been working extremely hard. The first announcement of scores showed over 5,000 points. It is now reported that more than 20 additional teams have been formed recently in Shanghai and other cities.

<h3>China Travel Service Establishes Branch in Singapore</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Xiangtao, the president of the China Travel Service in Shanghai, recognizing the exceptional isolation of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia regarding the situation in their motherland, personally toured and inspected the region this spring for the purpose of facilitating services. He established a branch office at No. 82 Robinson Road, Singapore, specifically to facilitate the travel affairs of local overseas Chinese, with comprehensive arrangements and swift operations. Recently, a group of overseas Chinese came to their homeland for sightseeing, and they were all hosted by the Singapore branch, with guides providing instructions along the way. They were all satisfied. From now on, the travel business in Southeast Asia will no longer be exclusively controlled by foreigners.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Hospital to Be Managed by the City</h3>
<p>The land on which the Shanghai Public Hospital in the Nanshi district is located is leased from the original grain storage base. The grain storage base is jointly owned by the city and county governments. Since the division of governance between the city and county, the hospital has been jointly managed by both. Currently, with the implementation of the division of jointly owned public property between the city and county, the Shanghai Public Hospital must also be resolved simultaneously. The Shanghai County Government proposed a swift and clear division to avoid prolonged indecision. The Shanghai Municipal Government has also expressed its agreement and has instructed the Finance, Public Works, Land, Social Affairs, and Health Bureaus, stating that the original grain storage funds and original public property should be divided together. However, since the Shanghai Hospital is related to the city's health business, it should be assigned to the city. Therefore, they are planning a reorganization to turn it into a city-run treatment facility, which will facilitate supervision and improvement to meet the medical needs of the citizens.</p>
<h3>YWCA Fundraising Assembly</h3>
<p>Since the opening ceremony of the joint fundraising assembly of the National YWCA and the Shanghai YWCA on Yuanyuan Road on the first of this month, held at the private residence of Mayor Wu, the team leaders and members have gone their separate ways to strive for fundraising matters. The association has now scheduled its first report meeting for this month on the 8th, in the afternoon, at the American Consulate General at No. 248 Jiangxi Road. Fundraising Assembly President Mrs. Kong Xiangxi and Mrs. Wu Tiecheng have jointly issued invitations to the association's advisors and team leaders and members to attend the meeting and report on the fundraising results. It is said that Mrs. Ames, wife of the American High Court Judge, and Mrs. Ames, wife of the Consul, will prepare refreshments to fulfill their host's duties.</p>
<h3>Joint Transportation Fees Temporarily Not Recorded for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Two Roads Administration received an instruction from the Ministry of Railways, stating: According to the Joint Transportation Office's submitted case regarding the 70th proposal of the 17th National Joint Transportation Meeting, concerning joint transportation of goods, each road should handle transportation fees as the starting road wishes to take full responsibility and requests approval for recording disaster relief. This case was resolved in the fourth resolution, stating that joint transportation will temporarily not be handled for disaster relief. It should be approved and implemented. In addition to separate orders, the Administration is hereby instructed to comply. The Administration has already instructed the Traffic and Accounting Departments to comply accordingly.</p>

<h3>Social Bureau Suppresses Vagrants Extorting Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>Attention All Hat Stall Owners</p>
<p>Report to the Police If Encountered</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Social Bureau recently received a confidential report that Zhang Aiyun, Zhang Shenggen, Ge Chengyu, Ge Chengzun, and other unemployed vagrants are extorting 2.5 yuan from over one hundred hat stalls in the Chinese and French Concessions under the pretext of organizing a labor union. They have stipulated that the fee be collected twice a year, in spring and autumn. Those who refuse to comply are threatened with axes and iron rulers. Upon receiving the report, the bureau immediately dispatched personnel to investigate. Although Han Genbao, Ge Zengwu, Ge Chengyun, and others initiated the establishment of the Hat Washing Workers' United Benefit Association in December of the 21st year of the Republic, it was never registered with the Social Bureau and soon ceased to exist informally. However, the names of Zhang Aiyun, Zhang Shenggen, Ge Chengyu, and Ge Chengzun are not on the list of initiators of this association. Furthermore, there has been no recent organization of a hat washing workers' union. The bureau considers this situation to be a clear case of unemployed vagrants extorting money. In addition to strict suppression, all hat stalls are authorized to report to the police if they encounter the above-mentioned situations, so as to avoid being defrauded.</p>

<h3>Garment Shop Owner Dies Suddenly After Two Injections</h3>
<p>Shop Assistants Hastily Summon Doctor</p>
<p>Obtained the Services of a Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Expired After a Noisy Fart</p>
<p>Wife Unsuccessful in Seeing Him Before His Death</p>
<p>Pan Jintao, age thirty-nine, a native of Nanhui, had been running the Qinyuji Garment Shop at No. 212 Route Paul Beau in the French Concession for many years. The business was quite prosperous. Unexpectedly, Pan suddenly suffered from dizziness within the past two or three days, recurring intermittently. He thought it was a minor ailment and did not rush to seek medical treatment. On the afternoon of the fifth, at 1:30 PM, Pan's illness recurred in the shop. He felt dizzy and unable to stand up, so he went to the room to lie down and rest. However, he suddenly fell to the ground before reaching the bed. The shop assistants, upon learning of this, rushed to help him up and carried him to bed. He immediately became delirious and unconscious. His wife, Shi, happened to be out on business. The shop assistants and residents were in a panic and immediately summoned a doctor, without taking the time to choose carefully. Since they had a telephone installed, they checked the telephone directory and found Shude Hospital at No. 180 Balizhao Street, a specialist in venereal diseases and gynecology. They called the hospital and summoned Dr. Gu Zongwen (age forty, from Wuxi), the director. Gu, without delay, immediately hired a Xiang Sheng taxi according to standard rates and rushed to the clinic. At this time, the patient was barely breathing and his pulse was extremely weak. Without asking for the consent of the patient's family, Gu administered an injection of coramine, a cardiac stimulant, into his arm. It had no effect. He then administered a second injection into the patient's chest. The patient let out a gasp, and as the needle was withdrawn, a noisy fart was released from below. The patient then breathed his last breath and passed away. Gu then charged his family for medical expenses, taxi fare, and a registration fee, totaling 27.8 yuan. At this time, Pan's wife had not yet returned to the shop. No one in the shop was responsible for this medical expense, and Gu was urgently demanding payment. While he was pressing for payment, Pan's wife, Shi, returned from outside and saw that her husband had died. She heard from neighbors and residents that Gu had been careless and caused his death. She immediately reported to the French police, who dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and took the two medicine bottles as evidence. The body was then transported by vehicle to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Mortuary for an autopsy. Yesterday, the Second Special District Court was notified and appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with forensic doctors Wei and Jiang, and clerk Peng, to visit the mortuary at noon to examine the body. After examining the body, they took their seats and questioned Pan Shi, the deceased's wife, Dr. Gu Zongwen, the defendant, and Xiao Zhou, the maidservant, about the circumstances of the illness, injections, and medical treatment. They concluded that Pan Jintao had died of illness. The body was handed over to his wife for burial.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>A group of Chinese and Westerners in this city have founded an art club with the aim of fostering an interest in art. The club holds an exhibition annually as a matter of routine. It is reported that the club plans to borrow No. 264 Jiangxi Road, Xinkang Yongzi, this month on the 11th to display oil paintings, watercolors, and other artworks for people from all walks of life to view.

<h3>Yixing Girl Zhao Jinfeng Jumps Out of a Water Pit</h3>
<p>Unable to Bear the Abuse of a Brothel Keeper</p>
<p>Seeking Relief from the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Zhao Jinfeng, a girl from Yixing, is 16 years old and quite beautiful. She used to live with her mother in her hometown, making a living by farming. Last April, due to the bankruptcy of the rural area and poor harvests in the fields, which led to economic hardship and difficult living conditions, the girl was lured to Shanghai by a rogue neighbor under the guise of introducing her to work in a factory as a female worker. She was sold into prostitution at the Xing surname brothel across from the Changxing Inn on Xixin Bridge in the French Concession. Every night, the brothel keeper forced her to go to small inns to receive guests and engage in prostitution, subjecting her to trampling. Moreover, the brothel keeper was of a shrewish nature. If Zhao Girl slightly disobeyed her, she would be whipped and even deprived of food and drink. All kinds of abuse made it no different from a human hell. At that time, the girl thought of running away many times, but in the end, because the brothel keeper and others kept a close watch, and she had no relatives or friends in Shanghai to turn to for help, she had to endure the humiliation with pain. Unexpectedly, recently the brothel keeper's abuse of Zhao Girl has been even worse than before, causing Zhao Girl to be unable to bear it any longer. Yesterday at around 8:00 AM, she fled with another private prostitute named Zheng Xifu and threw herself into the outer road police station of the 16th Pupu Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, asking for relief. When Chief Jin interrogated her about the case, Ms. Cai said that she was sixteen years old from a poor family. She was abducted to Shanghai as a child and raised as an adopted daughter in a private household of a certain surname in Daren Lane. Therefore, she did not know the surname and name of her biological parents. Last summer, when her body first showed unusual signs, she was forced by the brothel keeper to receive guests and suffered great humiliation. This time, she escaped specifically because she could not bear the brothel keeper's abuse and the life of a sacred female and asked for relief. The police chief ordered that a document be prepared to send the pair of pitiful young girls to the bureau together to find a way to help them.</p>
<h3>Seeking Divorce After One Year of Marriage</h3>
<p>Chen Dajun, a student at Fudan University from Dinghai, Zhejiang, is 23 years old and lives at No. 434 Xinmin Village, Maming Road, Bailainei, French Concession. He has recently been teaching at a Westerner's house. Last year, he developed love with Feng Heqing, a student at Moore Memorial Girls' School from Guangdong (21 years old this year, residing at No. 54 Dekang Lane, Fusheng Road, Zhabei), first through friendship, then got engaged. They got married last April 15th at Moore Memorial Church because both were Christians. Their love was as close as glue. In December, a son was born. Unexpectedly, flowers do not always bloom, and the moon is not always full. In September this year, they suddenly had disagreements, which were incompatible as water and milk. Feng Heqing hired a lawyer to file a petition with the civil court of the Second Special Court, requesting mediation for divorce and ordering the payment of alimony. Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, Judge Li Liang visited the Civil Seventh Court to summon both parties to the case for mediation. The petitioner's lawyer arrived on her behalf, stating the intention of the petition, and said that the respondent had insulted and scolded the petitioner not long after the marriage. As the petitioner had an elderly mother with no one to take care of her, and the petitioner lived with her mother, the respondent strongly opposed it. Therefore, the feelings of both parties were even more broken. In addition to requesting mediation for divorce, she also ordered the respondent to pay 2,000 yuan in alimony, which must be paid in one lump sum, as well as 100 yuan per month for living expenses and 50 yuan per month for child support. Chen Dajun, the respondent, said that after the marriage, the feelings between husband and wife were quite good. It was actually just an occasional quarrel and he did not want a divorce. After verifying the words, the court announced that the mediation had failed and ordered a formal lawsuit to be filed separately.</p>
<h3>Case of Young Woman Shot on Hobilan Road</h3>

<h3>Ferry Boats Compete for Business, Two Gangs Clash</h3>
<p>The ferry boats that transport passengers of the Chongming steamship in Wusong were previously operated by Xu Fengshan Guanfu and other ten people from the Hakka gang. Recently, after the Chongming gang Zhu Xi and others came forward to operate it, they officially rented a house on the shore and hung up a sign to transport passengers, which caused Xu Fengshan from the Hakka gang to have no means of making a living. The day before yesterday afternoon, Xu and others gathered a crowd to clash with Zhu Xi. Both sides used force. The gang police were summoned to the Wusong police station. After questioning by Chief Fu, because the case involved business disputes, the police were ordered to report the two parties to the general office for decision.</p>
<h3>Impersonating a Public Official Touching a Woman's Abdomen</h3>
<p>Ni Junxiang is Cunning and Sent for Investigation</p>
<p>Fan Leng's, a 23-year-old woman from Pudong living at No. 25 Wangyi Ma Lane in the city, is six months pregnant with a large belly. At 6:30 PM the other day, she was walking through the bottom of the East Lane, as the lane was under construction and there were few pedestrians. Suddenly, three hooligans impersonating public officials searched for suspicious pedestrians in order to rob them of their property. Fan Leng's was stopped by them and searched. As she had no silver dollars on her, the hooligans stroked the area around her belly. She questioned them as to what they were touching. The hooligans said that they suspected she was pretending to be pregnant to smuggle red pills. Because she realized that the hooligans did not look like public officials, she grabbed one of them and shouted for the police. Zhang Chengfeng from Post 25 arrived to help and arrested two of them and took them to the Yimiao police station for investigation. After questioning by Chief Liu, the plaintiff stated the same as above. The defendants, Ni Junxiang, 30 years old, from Zhenjiang, and Liu Daquan, 24 years old, confessed that they did not impersonate public officials to search pedestrians. Because the plaintiff's belly was big and fun, they touched it for fun. Chief Liu believed that the defendant's confession was cunning and that they were actually searching under false pretenses and intending to rob property. They should be severely punished to respect the corrupting customs and sentenced to be sent to the general office for handling.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of Being Sued by the Times Daily</h3>

However, recently, the Times Daily, a tabloid edited by Lai Lansheng, published an article on the 7th of last month, stating that Xiang Kangyuan was unable to maintain and closed down the Kangyuan Factory due to speculation in Japanese stocks. Xiang saw this and believed that the newspaper's report was completely a castle in the air, causing great damage to himself and the Kangyuan Factory. He sued Lai at the Xinzha patrol house. Attorney Qian Xunjiu of the Gongbu Ju Legal Department filed a public prosecution for defamation under Article 330 of the Criminal Law. The First Special Court had summoned him once. Lai Lansheng stated that in addition to apologizing to Mr. Xiang in major newspapers, he would also make corrections in this newspaper and write an impression record of the Kangyuan Factory, etc., for correction. Xiang said that since the defendant had made corrections, the private prosecution could not be filed, but Lai had to point out the contributor. After questioning by Judge Deng, he ordered Lai to pay 500 yuan to be released on bail pending judgment. Yesterday morning, Judge Deng Baosun opened the Criminal Second Court and announced the verdict. Lai Lansheng spread rumors and damaged the credit of others and was fined 500 yuan.

<h3>City News</h3>
<p>Domestic OK Locks Sell Well Since foreign goods invaded our country's market, the spring door lock, which is a necessary device for the doors of upper-middle-class families in the past ten years, dates back to seventy or eighty years ago. It is known for its beauty and durability, and the keys have hundreds of thousands of different numbers. In recent years, Chinese people have also known how to set up factories to manufacture themselves, such as the OK brand of various spring door locks produced by Wanneng Factory, which is indeed better than imported ones. This is because the person in charge of the factory is brave in research and good at improvement, which makes the products more refined day by day. Moreover, the factory has always adhered to the principle of small profits, so the pricing is absolutely civilian-oriented, in order to benefit the public. It is found that the most common door lock currently used by our people sells for more than one yuan per piece, and the internal mechanism is almost the same, easy to pry open, and locking is equal to locking, thus creating a supreme opportunity for night owls. These losses are known to everyone who knows a little. Now, the factory has seen this and the selling price is only two yuan per piece, which is not comparable to foreign goods worth seven or eight yuan a piece. It is a waste of painstaking effort. Users are happy to buy OK locks because of their low price and good quality, and knowledge-minded people also believe that it is a domestic product and it is very necessary to promote it.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education is sponsoring the National Vocational School and Primary and Secondary School Labor Curriculum Achievement Exhibition, which is scheduled to open on December 1st at the Examination Yuan in Nanjing. During the current preparation period, the ten preparation personnel sent by the Ministry of Education are still handling the preparation matters concurrently in the Ministry. At present, various statistical charts are being drafted for the products that have been sent or reported to be sent from various provinces and cities, so that when the products from various provinces and cities are displayed, there will be a general chart from the Ministry of Education to guide the visitors to easily find what they are looking for. This work is extremely busy, and the staff members are currently cooperating in the division of labor. The Examination Yuan venue will not be completely vacated until the 15th of this month.

Generally, remote provinces do not send representatives to Beijing to arrange the exhibition, but entrust friends in Beijing or staff members of the Ministry of Education to arrange the exhibition on their behalf. Many neighboring education departments have representatives arranging the exhibition themselves. Because the achievements of this session are divided into vocational schools and primary and secondary school labor courses, and the exhibition is organized by province and city, the provinces and cities must arrange it themselves. It is reported that all provinces and cities are participating, except for Guizhou, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, with a total of twenty-five provinces and cities.

<h3>East Asia Physical Education College Sports Meet Held in the Rain, Pan Yingchu Breaks National Record in Women's Javelin</h3>
<p>Score: 28.05 Meters</p>
<p>Qian Hangsu and Others Participate in Exhibition</p>
<p>The East Asia Physical Education College located in Lu Jia Wan of this city is known far and wide for its excellent achievements. It goes without saying. The 7th of this month is the anniversary of the college's founding. Every year during this period, a sports meet is held to celebrate. It has been learned that the college will continue its usual practice of holding its 16th-anniversary sports meet over the past two days, focusing on track and field competitions. Therefore, the college's affiliated teachers will not be able to participate in the Shanghai Municipal Middle School Sports Meet, which begins on the 8th. As for ball games and group performances, they will be held at a later date. To increase the interest of general athletes, the college has invited those who scored points in the National Games, such as Qian Hangsu, Wang Huachang, Su Xiaoru, and Jia Lianren, to give exhibition performances. Only scores will be recorded, not rankings. Prizes will also be awarded to those with excellent scores. Yesterday, the weather was cloudy and the west wind howled. It was drizzling, and the ground was muddy, which significantly affected the results. The jumping events in the field events could not be held. However, the college students were well-trained, and the male and female athletes showed great spirit and were not at all intimidated. Reviewing the results, Qian Hangsu's 80-meter low hurdles time was 14.5 seconds, maintaining his national record. His 50-meter time was 7 seconds, very close to Ms. Zhang Jieqiong's national record of 6.9 seconds. Jia Lianren's 800-meter time was 2 minutes and 12 seconds. It is a pity that the track was loose and the turns were small. To achieve this result under those conditions was not easy. Female student Pan Yingchu is a rising star. Her javelin throw of 28.05 meters broke the national record. Xu Yuan also had a score of 26.98 meters. If she can put in more effort, her future prospects are unlimited. The finalized results are listed below:</p>
<p>Men's Group</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Four: A Cup of Water Shows the Difficulty of Seeking, a Poor Laborer Protects the Elderly, Ten Thousand Taels Can Be Obtained, Cunning Officials Unite in Groups</p>
<p>The old man was still holding that bowl in his hand, hesitating whether to raise his hand to scratch his head, and unknowingly raised the bowl above his head. Realizing it himself, he immediately lowered his hand. Zhichien also saw it and couldn't help but laugh. The old worker's pointed, thin face, covered with many wrinkles, also showed a layer of red. He took two steps back. At this time, Zhang Jiefu and Li Shilian were standing under the corridor eaves talking. They saw Zhichien go to the factory in the back alone, and they thought to themselves, what is there to see about a tiler working? He must be chasing after that girl to make contact. Let's see how he proceeds. Therefore, these two people frequently walked to the corridor eaves. Now they saw such a beardless old man, standing at the doorway, neither entering nor leaving. The situation was even more suspicious, so the two of them simply stayed nailed under the corridor eaves and didn't leave. Zhichien inside kept calling out, "Old Tan, come in, would I deceive you?" When the old man heard someone say the word "deceive," it seemed as if he was doubting other people's good intentions. That was unacceptable, so he smiled and walked in. Zhichien picked up the teapot on the table and nodded at him. The old worker was truly a bit overwhelmed by the favor. He held the tile bowl in both hands and came forward to receive it. As Zhichien poured into the bowl, he repeatedly said, "I don't deserve it." Zhichien poured more than half a bowl. He held the bowl, like a monkey holding a peach, holding the bowl in both hands, putting his mouth to it, raising his neck, and gulping it down, drinking the bowl of tea in one breath. He also drew out the sound, "Ah," to express his great admiration. On the table, there was also half a plate of biscuits, which Zhichien had left over. Thinking that it wouldn't be respectful to just have someone come and drink a bowl of tea, he picked up the half plate of biscuits and smiled at him, "Take these and try them." The old man stepped back and said "I dare not" twice. He half-extended his hand, pinched a piece of biscuit with three fingers, and put it between his front teeth, biting off a tiny bit. Then he clasped his hands and nodded slightly, saying, "That's it, that's it." (58)</p>
<h3>When You Have No Money</h3>
<p>— By Zigao</p>
<p>When you have no money, then you will surely discover the miraculous power of money:</p>
<p>Of course, you can still remember the scene when you were a wealthy man with money to spare, living in a foreign-style house, eating fish and meat, wearing silk and satin, and using a car for transportation. In the summer, you ran to Mogan Mountain to escape the heat, and in the cold weather, you hid in a room with a radiator, drinking wine and admiring the snow with your wife. When you had nothing to do, you played cards and had fun, listened to the radio, watched Peking opera, played jai alai, went to the dog track, the cinema, the nightclub... and all sorts of people who were neither relatives nor friends would greet you with smiling faces to flatter you. As long as you opened your mouth, anything could be done. The big shot had plenty of "money." However, once you encountered an adverse fate, leading to ruin and death, and you wandered alone, you would experience many of the hardships of having no money. You would lack clothing and food and have no place to live. In the summer, you could sleep on the cement ground for a night, but in the cold weather, you could only shiver next to a pile of garbage in an alley. You could listen to the radio on the street, which could be considered a small comfort in the midst of hardship. But you would never think of setting foot in those gold-consuming places like dance halls and jai alai courts again. At that time, even those useless people who were neither relatives nor friends and who used to greet you with smiling faces to flatter you would show you an icy face like a stranger. They might even scold you with a few words, "In a noisy city, no one asks about the poor; in the deep mountains, distant relatives are numerous for the rich." You would believe these two sentences without any doubt. Zhu Zhishan once wrote a couplet, "The rich are like swimming dragons, traveling all over the five mountains and four seas; the poor are like leftover tigers, scaring away all their relatives." That’s enough to describe the misery of having no money.</p>
<p>Yes, when you have no money, you will feel so many hardships. Even walking on the street, you will feel unusually constrained, as if your feet are chained, preventing you from moving. However, it also seems as if you are a runaway horse, and your four hooves want to leap forward. But you also think back to the scene when you had money!</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<h3>(Cold Jade)</h3>
<p>Passing by Zhejiang Road, I saw a shop using live advertisements: a person dressed in white, wearing a mask and a tall hat, holding a large folding fan, promoting products. This was certainly a novel performance. Across the street, a foreign elderly couple was also watching intently. I wonder what they thought of this living "Wuchang" (a ghostly figure in Chinese folklore)?</p>
<h3>Two Diligent Female Workers</h3>
<p>— Ye Qibai</p>
<p>For the past six months, besides teaching many subjects during the day, I also ran a night school for the public in the evenings. The students in the night school were mostly girls, and these girls were mostly factory workers during the day.</p>
<p>I find their spirit of learning truly astonishing. So, they continuously sign up to enroll in the school, and I accept all who come, having already taken in over a hundred.</p>
<p>One day, before class started, and after I had prepared all my work, I casually looked around the classroom. As I was looking, two students happened to ask me about new characters. These two students were sisters. After I taught them, I started chatting with them casually. I asked, "Do you work during the day?" "Yes, we do." "Together?" "Yes." I then asked, "So, which factory do you work at?" "The Nanyang Tobacco Company." "That must be very inconvenient!" "Yes, we leave our home in Pudong in the morning and come back from the factory in the evening." "What about meals?" I asked further. "We just buy something to eat." "So, what time do you leave in the morning and return in the evening?" "We get up at five in the morning, wash our faces, and cross the river to the factory. We don't return until four or five in the afternoon." "That means you get home very late, and time is very rushed," I said. "Yes, when we get home, we grab our books and rush to the night class at six-thirty!" "What about dinner?" "We eat after the night class." "Oh! That must be very hard!" They didn't say anything, silently staring at the ground.</p>
<p>Later, I learned from other students about their difficult family situation, that they had an elderly grandmother and a disabled mother at home, and their father had died early. The livelihood of the two elderly people depended on the four hands of these two girls.</p>
<h3>Who Will Win?</h3>
<p>— Man Wu</p>
<h3>Prayer</h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>The solemn church was filled with a dense crowd of believers, men, women, the old, and the young, sitting together, so quiet that almost everyone could hear their own heartbeat. But in the front left corner sat only young women and older nuns; I soon learned that it was a specially arranged choir.</p>
<p>The choir sang as the main force, with many believers joining in. The tones were so harmonious, and the attitude was so solemn that even the piano did not break the harmonious unity. The piano is truly a strange thing! It can be played to accompany songs like "Drizzling Rain" and "Peach Blossom River," but it can also accompany this sacred hymn! —The piano itself has no sin; sin lies in those who use it.</p>
<p>"Jesus loves me, I love Jesus!" The church sang intensely and orderly, but outside the door, naughty children mischievously shouted, "Jesus loves me, I don't love Jesus!" The pastor's assistant came out to disperse them, and the solemn church lost some of its solemnity!</p>
<p>After that, it was the pastor's sermon, about the Heavenly Father and Christ, emphasizing that everyone should revere the Heavenly Father and Christ. But just revering isn't enough; you must also believe in Him, obey Him, and listen to all His words. Christ is always with us, so we must be careful in everything we do; attempting to deceive Him is impossible...</p>
<p>Finally: unanimous prayer from the entire congregation, each silently reciting their own prayer.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Matchmaker</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Among Wei's friends, Ping often advised him to get married early. The reason was that Ping had a happy family, so she also hoped that her friends could have a happy family.</p>
<p>One day, Ping went to Wei's residence to find him and talked about this matter again:</p>
<p>"Wei, let me be your matchmaker. This is one of my cousins. She's two or three years younger than you and has received a considerable education at school," Ping said happily.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your kindness, but I want to focus all my energy on my career right now, so I don't want to get marri..." Wei hadn't finished speaking when Ping interrupted him:</p>
<p>"I know, you haven't met her in person, and you don't know what she looks like, so you don't want to. I'll bring her to the club tomorrow night for you to see. I'm definitely not an old-fashioned matchmaker, selling a cat in a bag, saying it's a white cat, but when you get it, it's a black cat!" Ping said, and without getting Wei's consent, she left smiling.</p>
<p>The next evening, Wei was playing games at the club when Ping indeed brought a girl, and as she walked in, she introduced her:</p>
<p>"This is my cousin," Ping said, then pointed at Wei and said to the girl she brought:</p>
<p>"This is Mr. Wei."</p>
<p>Wei asked them to sit down and chatted with them for a while, and then they got up to leave.</p>
<p>"Wei, I need to take my cousin home now. We'll see you in a few days," Ping said.</p>
<p>Wei didn't keep them and saw them to the door, watching them get into the car and leave.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>A few days later, Wei met Ping again at the club; this time, Ping's cousin didn't come along.</p>
<p>"How was it? Were you satisfied with what you saw?" Ping asked Wei.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"The matchmaking I did for you!" Ping said coquettishly.</p>
<p>"Haha... I told you earlier that I want to focus on my career now, and I don't want to get married," Wei said solemnly.</p>
<p>"Really, you don't want to get married? Then don't you feel lonely!"</p>
<p>"Focusing on one's career can ward off the demon of loneliness."</p>
<p>"Actually, even married people feel lonely!" Ping's argument changed again, and she started talking about other things.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>A long time passed, and once when Wei and Ping met, Wei casually asked about Ping's cousin. He learned that Ping's cousin had already gotten married. She married a wealthy man with a car, a Western-style house... She married him because he could satisfy her material desires. Ping also said that when she had initially talked to her cousin about Wei's situation, she wasn't very satisfied, although she did say that Wei was a promising young man. But in the end, she married a millionaire who was twice her age.</p>
<p>From this incident, Wei's conclusion was: "In this day and age, the most effective medium is still money!"</p>
<h3>Records from the Fragrant Imperial Past</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Her eyesight had never changed with her age, and at this moment, she was particularly attentive, so I thought she must have taken in all the scenery here in an instant! But she stood there for a long time, still motionless, as if these historical scenes had moved her thoughts like the Shanhaiguan Pass. The rest of us remained trembling and prostrate, even breathing extra carefully to avoid startling her. This frozen picture of one person standing solemnly and hundreds prostrating lasted for a full ten minutes. Later, she slowly moved her footsteps, but she stopped after walking only five or six steps; presumably, she intended to look at the scenery in another corner, and standing in the original place was inconvenient, so she wanted to move to a place where she could see more clearly.</p>
<p>Everyone kneeling remained motionless like clay sculptures or wooden carvings, the piles of colors as still as flowers inserted in a vase: because unless the Empress Dowager personally announced that we could stand up, no one, not even the Guangxu Emperor, dared to move on their own. And there was even less sound. At this time, only the Empress Dowager slowly paced around the hall with an extremely reserved and small gait. Her attitude seemed outwardly always very calm: but in my estimation, her hesitation at this time was actually a manifestation of inner panic. She herself might have wanted to find a place to rest quickly, or she might have wanted to lead everyone to inspect the place, or she might have wanted... In short, her thoughts must have been very confused, and she didn't know what to do for a moment, so she had to temporarily pace around the hall for a while!</p>
<p>In the past few days, she had been on the train and then carried in a phoenix carriage, so her entire life could be said to have been in a state of motion; now, returning to the stillness of the palace, she couldn't help but feel a little different! (168)</p>

<p>Gold Market on the Second Day of the Autumn Races Broke Through the Thousand Yuan Mark</p>
<p>—A Midday Result Showing a Further Increase of Six Yuan and Eight Jiao—</p>
<p>The gold market has been showing a mediocre situation for days. Yesterday was the second day of the Autumn Races. Traditionally, only the morning session is open for business. The market sentiment was exceptionally firm. Although the initial trading was relatively calm, once the buying spree started, the price surge was exceptionally strong. This is a typical trend during the race season. There is a saying about the "racetrack line," because with only half a day of trading, a sudden change is extremely difficult to stop. Yesterday, the market once broke through the 1,000 yuan mark. Initially, the overseas silver market showed London weakening and the U.S. remaining unchanged, with both exchange rates rising. London spot gold fell by three and a half pence. Off-market pre-trading retreated to 90 yuan and change. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with the U.S. rising by 0.0625. The customs gold rate fell by four li. The standard gold price retreated to 989 yuan and seven jiao. After a low opening in the morning, although it once fell back into the 90 yuan range, the market sentiment seemed firm. The buyers were particularly active. The HSBC bank's exchange rates were announced, with the U.S. rising by 0.0625, which was due to exchange rate factors and had little impact. The gold market hovered and remained stable. Later, the Central Bank's silver equalization tax rate was announced, remaining at 7.25 percent. Calculated with an exchange rate of one shilling and four pence and seventy-five points, the market was calm and unchanged at this time, hovering around one yuan. Afterwards, Chinese merchants showed a tendency to buy aggressively, and the domestic market was tight. With market sentiment already optimistic, the gold price gradually rose. Buyers became more and more numerous and bolder. Even with supply, it was difficult to compete. It broke through the 1,000 yuan mark. Banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, and prices fell back after reaching a high. However, because Yuan Mao, Yongfu, Yu, and others continued to buy gold bars, it was still possible to push prices higher, but it did not exceed the 1,000 yuan mark again. After this, more people took advantage of the high prices to sell. The midday close fell slightly, and the market was potentially tired and weak after the close. The trading during the half-day was still active, and the market turned bullish, but there was also a lack of special changes. The half-day market conditions are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>

As for foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was down by a small 8 fen for near months and up by a good 2 jiao for far months. Canada was down by a small 8 fen. After the opening quotation, the market sentiment was initially flat due to little fluctuation in foreign wheat prices. However, with increased buying from non-industry players, driven by the rising rice prices and the influenced sentiment in the interior, the buying appetite was strong. Prices for all months quietly rose by about 2 fen. Subsequently, slight selling from the factories caused market sentiment to weaken again, and prices fell back by 1 or 2 fen compared to the opening quotation. When the market opened in the afternoon, the flour market atmosphere revived due to the absence of foreign wheat hawking and the disagreement among the factories. Short positions from non-industry players were quickly covered, and rumors of a small amount of buying from the money industry caused the market to rebound. The opening quotation gradually rose, and if the factories do not sell strongly, there may be further increases. As a result, the current month was up by a good 2 fen 2 li and a half, December was up by a good 2 fen and a half, January-February was up by a good 3 fen 2 li and a half, March was up by a good 3 fen and a half, and April was up by a good 3 fen 7 li and a half.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was weak as before due to the slight decline in customs gold. The association's designated prices for current spot 24 raw granulated white sugar were 18 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen for ordinary goods, and 18 yuan 8 jiao 3 fen for high-quality goods, with some transactions. Local goods were 18 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, and transit goods were 5 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen. High-quality 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar was 14 yuan 2 jiao 3 fen, with sporadic transactions. Transit goods were quoted at 5 yuan 1 jiao. The Zhenyu No. 1 fine white sugar from local factories was still 16 yuan 9 jiao. Chaoqing had a new arrival of over a hundred bales of white Baohuanggang Qing sugar at 12 yuan 1 jiao, and the next grade at 11 yuan 9 jiao. It is heard that the sugar factory run by the Guangdong government has been very successful, and the area planted for this season has greatly increased. The local sugar industry association has sent people to Guangdong to negotiate, and an agreement has been reached. In the future, it may undertake the sales of Shanghai sugar. It is expected that new samples will be available by the middle of next month. Various types such as 24 raw granulated white sugar, fine white sugar, and Dutch red sugar can be replicated. Everything that is available in foreign goods will be available here. The future is promising and can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>October Silk Inventory Report from England and America</p>
<p>Recently received telegrams regarding silk inventory bottom in the US for October as follows (unit: bale):</p>
<p>Estimated 47,600 bales in transit to New York in October. The London city silk inventory report for October is as follows (unit: bale):</p>
<p>Halved Transportation Fee Approved for Hubei Silk Cocoons</p>
<p>Mianyang and other counties in Hubei Province are rich in yellow and white silk cocoons. In recent years, due to the drastic decline in sales of foreign silk, the decline of the silk industry in Hubei Province is the same as in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Silk merchants in Hubei jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry, requesting that the transportation fee for silk cocoons from Hubei Province, when transported by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, be reduced by half the original price, following the example of silk cocoon transportation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, in order to provide relief. According to the Hubei silk merchants in Shanghai, the Ministry of Industry has approved the request and instructed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to handle the matter accordingly.</p>
<p>Silk Factory's Long-Strand Spun Silk Transportation to Shanghai is Unsatisfactory</p>
<p>Due to the sharp increase in domestic silk fabric sales, the source of long-strand spun silk from silk factories is not smooth. Yesterday, various manufacturers in Wuxi borrowed and loaded 70 pieces and transported them to Hangzhou by train.</p>
<p>Tea Market Increasingly Deserted During Racing Season</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign tea market was deserted due to the Western merchants' horse racing, with only half a day of trading for foreign firms. The entire market saw only Tongfu, Yongxing, Baochang, and other firms purchase a total of 136 boxes of Zhenmei, Zhenmei needle tea, and green tea. Top-quality Zhenmei needle tea was sold at 125 yuan, which was the same as before. In addition, there were sporadic sales of tea from Hunan and Hubei, and Jiangxi tea in shops.</p>

<h3>The Literati and Poverty</h3>
<p>— Zhou Benzhai</p>
<p>It seems that there has always been some kind of connection between literati and poverty. In reality, who is not poor? How can the poverty of literati compare to the poverty of non-literati? However, literati take poverty as a "common topic," as if only literati are poor, and the poverty of non-literati does not count for anything.</p>
<p>When literati talk about poverty, on the one hand, they are expressing their elegance, and on the other hand, they believe that poverty is related to literature. The so-called "poverty leads to craftsmanship," even if it is not the primary motivation, it is at least a driving force. When one is poor, one's writing becomes "craftful," which is remarkable. However, non-literati cannot talk about these things. It is precisely because they are poor that they are called vulgar people by the so-called elegant people. It is precisely because they are poor that they are not only unable to become literati, but also isolated by literature, losing the tool for conveying emotions to each other. It is precisely because they are poor that they form this special group of literati. Moreover, even poverty has become a tool for literati to claim and flaunt themselves, and their poverty is rejected outside the circle, counting for nothing.</p>
<p>The poverty of literati must be different from the poverty of non-literati.</p>
<p>Then, the poverty of non-literati is the poverty of life; the poverty of literati is the poverty of circumstances. Literati are the elite among intellectuals. Intellectuals are scholars. Scholars are those who seek officialdom, who want to "learn well and then become officials." Not becoming an official means not being recognized; not being recognized means being poor. The ancients often used the words "poverty" and "success" in contrast, which is the meaning of this. As Mencius said: "In poverty, do not lose righteousness; in success, do not depart from the way." He also said: "When poor, cultivate your own moral character; when successful, benefit all under heaven." If poverty refers to the poverty of life, how can one "cultivate one's own moral character"? Literati have always followed this meaning.</p>
<p>Due to the difference between poverty and success, literature also presents different perspectives. The literature of the successful is celebratory literature. The literature of the poor is lament literature. Ouyang Xiu clearly explained this division in his "Preface to the Poetry Collection of Mei Shengyu": "I have heard the world say that poets are rarely successful and mostly poor. Is this really the case? The poems that are passed down in the world mostly come from the words of poor people in ancient times. All scholars who have their talents and cannot apply them to the world mostly like to indulge themselves outside the mountains and rivers, seeing the forms and categories of insects, fish, grass, trees, wind, clouds, birds, and beasts, often exploring their strangeness, with the depression of worries, thoughts, and anger inside. Their poems arise from resentment and satire, expressing the laments of exiled officials and widowed women, and writing the unspeakable feelings of people. The poorer they are, the more craftful they become. Therefore, it is not that poetry can impoverish people, but rather that it is after being impoverished that they become craftful. My friend Mei Shengyu, as a young man, was appointed as a historian through family privilege, and was repeatedly suppressed by officials in the imperial examinations, struggling in the states and counties for more than ten years. At the age of fifty, he was still following appointment letters, serving as an assistant to others, suppressing his accumulated talents and not being able to show them in his career... However, regardless of the wise or the foolish, those who talk about poetry must seek it from Shengyu. Shengyu himself also takes pleasure in poetry and expresses it because of his frustrations. Therefore, his lifelong works are mostly poetry. The world already knows this, but no one has recommended him to the court... If he were fortunate enough to be used in the court, writing odes and hymns to sing the praises of the great Song dynasty's merits and virtues, recommending them to the Qing Temple, and following the authors of odes in the Shang, Zhou, and Lu dynasties, wouldn't that be great! Why should he be allowed to grow old without success, and write poems of the poor, only expressing the words of insects, fish, things, melancholy, and lamentation? The world only likes his craftsmanship, not knowing that his poverty has been long-lasting and he is about to grow old. It is a pity!" Here, what is said that "poetry cannot impoverish people" is very true. Not only can poetry not impoverish people, but on the contrary, it can make people not poor and successful. Poetry and writing were originally tools for scholars to become officials. If the tool is effective, then one succeeds and writes celebratory literature. This is what it means to "be fortunate enough to be used in the court, writing odes and hymns to sing the praises of ××'s merits and virtues, recommending them to the Qing Temple, and following the authors of odes in the Shang, Zhou, and Lu dynasties," wouldn't that be great! If the tool is ineffective, then one is poor and writes lament literature. This is what it means to "express the words of insects, fish, things, melancholy, and lamentation," which is a pity!</p>
<p>But if the so-called "poverty leads to craftsmanship," "the poorer one is, the more craftful one becomes," there is a distinction to be made. First of all, this poverty refers to the poverty of circumstances, not the poverty of life. The content of poverty determines the content of "craftsmanship." Secondly, even if the poverty of circumstances affects the poverty of life, this is only in relation to success and is simply poverty. Therefore, one still cannot feel the true experience of poverty in life and cannot write the true reality of poverty in life. If we talk about "craftsmanship," it is the "craftsmanship" of lament, the so-called "craftful in sorrow and good at illness."</p>
<h3>On the Banks of the Red River</h3>
<p>— Liubing</p>
<p>Near that distant equator, lies quietly Bandung, known as the "Switzerland of the East." There, tropical coconut trees thrive beneath the deep blue sky, and clumps of white clouds drift suspended from the coconut leaves. The people who live there all carry weary hearts and faces tanned by the sun. Bandung is beautiful, and the people in Bandung all have beautiful hearts. Not far from Bandung, there is an even more beautiful river that winds through Java, with coconut trees forming riverbanks on both sides. Monkeys leap and sing in the unknown vines. This is the serene Red River.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I wandered to the banks of the Red River as if in a dream. Once my traveler's heart, petrified by the city, came into contact with this beautiful nature, it unconsciously became attached. In the evening, I liked to go to the banks of the Red River alone, holding my mandolin, sitting under the tall coconut trees, facing the crescent moon, facing the quiet river, playing my favorite tunes, and humming unfamiliar Malay melodies.</p>
<p>One evening, as I was singing a Malay tune, an elderly Malay man came. He said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Wah! The moon is really good tonight!" (Malay people call young men "wah")</p>
<p>"Hmm! Do you also love this place, old man?" I started talking to him in Malay.</p>
<p>"I know you love this place. I see you sitting here every night, and I hear your singing."</p>
<p>"Yes! Look, how quiet the sky is here, how beautiful the river is!"</p>
<p>"Wah! Do you say the river is beautiful! It is red!"</p>
<p>"But the river is not red at all!" I said, looking at it.</p>
<p>"Hehe! This river was once stained with the blood of you Chinese!" he shouted in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>"The blood of the Chinese?"</p>
<p>"Yes! The blood of the Chinese has dyed this river red!" He sat down beside me, lowering his head. After a while, he slowly raised his head, his eyes filled with grief and indignation, and said in a low voice: "Wah! Do you know why this river is called the Red River? There is a moving story here. It was a long time ago, your Chinese ancestors came to Java to trade with our ancestors. Then, your ancestors planted fields and built houses in Java, and lived a peaceful life with our ancestors.</p>
<p>"But, wah! One day, many white people suddenly came, the white people who now rule this place, they wanted your ancestors' land, they wanted your ancestors' houses. But they were afraid of the Chinese emperor, so they didn't dare to act. Later, I heard that they went to see your Chinese emperor, saying that the Chinese were bullying them, and asking the emperor to severely punish them, ha! What did your emperor say? He said that your ancestors were people outside the pale of civilization and had nothing to do with the Celestial Empire. So the white people came back. They had guns and cannons, and your ancestors were people forgotten by their motherland, and were brutally killed by the white people. The Chinese retreated, all the way to the riverbank, and could not retreat any further, and were killed one by one by those vicious white people, and the corpses were thrown into the river, and the river was stained with the blood of the Chinese, and turned red, and this river was called the Red River!"</p>
<p>"Wah! Now the river water has long been clear, but the Chinese are still forgotten by their homeland!"</p>
<p>After saying this, the old man walked away falteringly. I looked at his departing figure, looked at the river, and the river turned red before my eyes. I hurriedly closed my eyes and ran back. The old man's words were deeply imprinted on my heart:</p>
<p>Chinese people forgotten by their motherland!</p>
<h3>Wonton Noodle Carrier</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Parting</h3>
<p>— Yanfu</p>
<p>With a tense and melancholic heart, I went to Hong Kong with Zi.</p>
<p>This trip to Hong Kong was because I was waiting for a ship to return to Shanghai. Hong Kong is a place I often visit. Every summer vacation, I would travel back and forth to my hometown, always leaving hurried footprints on this bustling island with a few classmates; but this time was special. The person who came with me was not a classmate returning to Shanghai, but Zi, who came to see me off.</p>
<p>Seeing her reluctant expression, how could I not be melancholic? The night before my departure, I told her the news that I was returning to Shanghai. She immediately cried, sobbing on the pillow, tightly holding my hand, as if she had thousands of words to tell me, but couldn't say a word. It wasn't until I ran out to the hall to say goodbye to her family that she wiped away her tears and saw me home from the late night.</p>
<p>We arrived in Hong Kong the day before the ship sailed because we wanted to take a look at the cabins in advance. That day, we especially crossed the sea from Hong Kong to Kowloon. On the ferry, I saw the huge Russian Empress in the distance, and couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>After spending the night in Hong Kong, I disembarked the next morning. The cabin was crowded with passengers and coolies. I found a berth, put my luggage away, and ran to the deck with Zi. In order to dispel her sadness of parting, I often told her about my past travels, and sometimes deliberately asked her other questions, but she always remained silent.</p>
<p>"Zi, look, the color of the sea is really beautiful. Do you see that sailboat far away?" I asked her deliberately again.</p>
<p>There was no reply. Looking at her, her eyes were red and filled with tears.</p>
<p>We were both silent, and memories of the summer vacation flooded my mind. I remembered the cool breeze on Yuexiu Mountain at dawn, and the golden water in Lychee Bay at dusk.</p>
<p>The time for the ship to sail arrived, and the bell warning the send-off had already rung. I led her out of the cabin. When we reached the gangway, she suddenly tightly held my hand:</p>
<p>"I wish you—a—smooth—voyage—"</p>
<p>Her throat choked up, her tears flowed down again, and my eyes couldn't help but burst into a few hot tears. Wiping her eyes, she said again:</p>
<p>"Come back quickly as soon as summer vacation starts next year"!</p>
<p>Her trembling voice came from a helpless mood. I nodded and helped her onto the gangway. When tears flowed down again, the gangway was lowered by the workers.</p>
<p>The ship was moving slowly. I stood on the deck, waving my handkerchief to her, and tears flowed down even more uncontrollably. Wiping my eyes with the waving handkerchief, I raised it again and waved it so enthusiastically. At this moment, a burst of music from the music room spread out as the ship sailed, every sound piercing my heart!</p>

<h3>On Leisurely Living</h3>
<p>— Ge Bai</p>
<p>Leisure is a virtue, that gentle gentlemanly demeanor is the unique national characteristic of us Chinese.</p>
<p>In the morning, go to a teahouse with a birdcage, for lunch, go to a storytelling house to chew melon seeds and spiced beans, come back and take a turn at Daoxiangcun or Laoda Fang, carrying back triangular, rectangular, large and small packages of tea snacks and candies, and for dinner, even better, have three cups of sorghum liquor, and then in an orderly manner, enjoy the pleasure under the lamp with your wife and children, eat sesame nougat, talk about the turtles being released in the City God Temple, within a room, joy and harmony, lying on the bed, you won’t have nightmares about a big fire burning next door, and a night passes without a word, straight until the next morning, when the red sun fills the window again.</p>
<p>Firstly, you were indeed born into the right womb, born as a Chinese person, and secondly, your ancestors accumulated virtue, whether they created sins or shed sweat, it is always a blessing for their children and grandchildren, as long as you kowtow and offer sacrifices in a proper manner during the four seasons and eight festivals, your conscience will be clear, and you will be a filial son and obedient citizen.</p>
<p>If you have a moment of leisure, play eight rounds of mahjong, or have a tea gathering, we can't say it's wild gambling, it's hard to live a lifetime, why get up at dawn? If you smoke opium, you can both protect your ancestral property and reduce internal heat, all beauty is available, and nothing is lacking, the way of leisure ends here!</p>
<p>Observe in a small room, the bean-sized lamp dimly lit, raising your leg like that, tilting your head, puffing smoke, looking at each other with one eye, a mouthful of strong tea and a mouthful of smoke, not to mention the loss of the Northeast, which is far away, even if the January 28th Incident’s gunfire is everywhere, it's just a matter of going up to the third floor to watch the big fire burning in Zhabei from afar.</p>
<p>Other small matters, if it rains when you go out, don't rush around, you must know that it's better to get your clothes wet than to disrupt your pace; when calling a rickshaw, don't say "a dime," but say "two hundred and forty cash," because big (foreign) and small (coins) are different, and when having a bowl of porridge, think about where it came from. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, admire the moon by climbing onto the drying platform and pacing back and forth, and in October, eat crabs and write poetry with a bottle of chrysanthemum wine. On New Year's Eve, burn a vigil candle, and on New Year's Day, personally light the incense for the heavens.</p>
<p>Beside the opium couch, teach your children to read, hoping they will surpass you!</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Opening of the New Cambridge Library</h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>According to reports, the Cambridge University in England just opened a new library, with shelf space for 43 miles of books, containing 1.5 million volumes. A generous donation was made by the American oil tycoon. After reading this, I was filled with lament. I am working in a university in China, which proudly bears the title of "National." The poverty of its book collection is so depressing that it makes one breathless. Several times I went to borrow some ordinary books, checking the catalog over and over again, and nineteen times out of twenty I was disappointed. A friend from a private university, with great hope, came to borrow books for a specialized topic, but I took him there and he found nothing.</p>
<p>I believe, and I am even more certain, that this is not a miracle. The poverty of book collections in Chinese universities is probably the general situation.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will come out and explain: "China is a poor country, and the history of its libraries is very short, so of course it cannot compare with foreign countries; in another thirty or fifty years, it will no longer be as poor as it is now." But how can this convince people? China's history is longer than that of foreign countries, and according to the law of "accumulation," we should be stronger than foreign countries. If this continues, it will be the same even after another thirty or fifty years, I dare to say.</p>
<p>What is the problem? It is that the general school funding is allocated so improperly, with administrative expenses occupying the highest peak of the curve on the statistical paper, while construction expenses are truly minimal, and the purchase of books naturally has to be put aside. Moreover, schools are often bureaucratic, and those in charge are afflicted with the "five-day magistrate of the capital" mentality, counting each day as it comes, and no one is willing to work hard for the future of the school. What construction is there to talk about? Just getting by is enough.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I am even more reminded of the wealthy people in China who possess vast fortunes, but are also extremely stingy, only seeking enjoyment in their own lives, and few are willing to take out money to run cultural undertakings. There is no one like Rockefeller who donates 250,000 pounds at a time. The ×× Library was destroyed in the January 28th Incident, and two years later it still had to rely on donations from Germany to be restored. Having such a relatively good library to support the scene is still something that is barely satisfactory.</p>
<p>I wonder what the people of the country will think after reading the above news? And the decline of Chinese cultural standards is probably related to this!</p>
<h3>Mother</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Every time I return home, I see that my mother's hair is thinner each time, mixed with gray in the withered and scorched hair, and the bun has been eroded smaller by the passing years.</p>
<p>Mother was born in the countryside, she cut grass for sheep, herded cattle, and carried firewood on the shoulder pole to the market when she was young. It is said that at that time, a chicken egg was only three copper coins, and a sesame cake was a big piece for one copper coin, but my mother rarely got to taste them. Later, she came to Shanghai and worked with my father in the workshop, working until midnight, and going to sleep hungry. Now, she still has to take care of the housework, and in the morning, she takes a scale and a basket to the vegetable market, and she will buy back the things we like to eat, like pumpkins and taro. When I am not at home, she stubbornly sets aside a little of what the family has for me—even if it's moldy, she still has to keep it.</p>
<p>I will never forget that when I am working outside, I always paste my mother's face on my eyelids, looking at it in a daze in my mind, that kind and gentle smile, the wide and faint eyebrows on her brown-yellow face, the ordinary nose, and the years of trachoma sufferer, her eyes always surrounded by tears, her mouth is a mouth that will not say an angry word, her gentle voice can make a disobedient and unruly son kneel down and repent. In my dreams in a foreign land, I often seem to hear my mother calling my name faintly. But! When I open my eyes, where is my mother? At home, her gentle voice and kind face are carried on my journey of life, like a radio, it provokes thoughts and comforts the sorrow of separation.</p>
<p>It seems like two sharp nails were hammered into my mother's life. When she recalls the untimely deaths of my two older brothers, it will stir up some old pain.</p>
<p>"Having raised you this big, you can talk, laugh, and jump. When you were little and had some illnesses, it made me like a headless fly. I don't expect you to get rich or get promoted, but don't forget the suffering of your mother raising you." Whenever my younger brother and I are playing and jumping in front of my mother, she will repeat these words.</p>
<p>When I'm outside, I often think about bringing something back for my mother to eat, but, there's nothing! Fruits are cooling, and my mother has had a cold stomach for years. Snacks are something she has always rejected, but she makes an exception for chestnuts, she loves the charred aroma of chestnuts. But she doesn't want me to buy them often, "It's hard to earn money, save what you can." I firmly remember these words and write them in thick ink in my notebook, adding some kind gestures, wrapped in a clean handkerchief, great maternal love is always deeply hidden in the son's heart, what can I boast about to the world? I have no affinity for inheritance, what I will receive is—</p>
<p>Mother's great love.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's First Nursery Has Closed</h3>
<p>— Bu Bai</p>
<p>In our large country of China, we lag behind in everything, but our culture was the first to develop, so we consider foreigners as barbarians and are arrogant. However, since the Opium War (strictly speaking, it should be after the Boxer Rebellion), this self-respecting mentality was shattered by the material civilization of the great powers! So we blindly imitate foreigners, taking foreigners as our guide, echoing what others say, it is truly ridiculous.</p>
<p>I say, imitating foreigners is not bad in itself, but if we imitate blindly and have no creativity of our own, then that kind of imitation is too meaningless, isn't it? Our imitation should be creative.</p>
<p>Recently, on the cultural scene, due to the large number of "foreign" theories imported from abroad, people have seized on a theory and implemented it regardless of the Chinese environment.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>However, because they have not considered that theory is related to the environment, they often shatter their beautiful ideals and are left with a painful face, not knowing what to do!</p>
<p>In the past, there was a debate about nurseries. Those who argued that nurseries could exist in China often used the nurseries in the Soviet Union as an analogy to explain the reasons why they could exist, which is quite ridiculous. You must know that the reason why nurseries can be "truly" implemented in the Soviet Union is that the political system in the Soviet Union is fundamentally different from that in China. As for the reasons why nurseries can exist in capitalist countries (of course, this existence is different from that in the Soviet Union), it is because nurseries are fundamentally one of the social policies of capitalism. Looking back at our China, has capitalism developed as much as in England and America?</p>
<p>Therefore, the principle of nurseries is correct, but to implement it in China, one must consider the Chinese environment. I once talked to a steel factory worker who was distressed about having children. I enthusiastically said to him, "Why not send them to a nursery?" When he learned that the monthly boarding fee for nurseries was eight yuan, he stuck out his tongue and said, "I dont even earn twenty yuan a month, how can I use eight yuan to send one child to a nursery?" So he told me that his children are boarded in the countryside, and only two yuan a month is enough for boarding fees!</p>
<p>If China wants to run nurseries, it must reduce the boarding fees to two yuan, but is that possible in reality? My answer is so decisive: "Impossible!" You see, the closure of the First Nursery, although it does not explicitly state that it is because of economic reasons, is actually because they are going to "try out" a "small-scale" one in the future, which shows that they are economically strapped! So, even with an eight-yuan boarding fee, they still feel strapped!</p>
<p>Finally, I must solemnly declare: I do not oppose the principle of nurseries at all, but I sincerely hope that those who run nurseries, or those who are enthusiastic about nurseries, should not abuse foreign theories (Soviet or even British and American) and not consider the current Chinese environment at all.</p>
<h3>Journey</h3>
<p>— Yong Bo</p>
<p>Night.</p>
<p>The night shrouded the hazy mountains and fields, and a strange wind howled: a will-o'-the-wisp floated among the desolate tombs, adorning this gloomy world.</p>
<p>I swung my exhausted limbs, looked around, and then tremblingly sat down on the roadside signpost. A moment of rest is hard-won.</p>
<p>I silently murmured in loneliness: This long journey, burdened with the scars of thorns. — The scars have been accumulated for a long time!</p>
<p>Under the shining of the stars, I examined the blood stains on my chest and shoulders, but my heart suddenly felt a sharp pain. The thorns are so sharp! So keen! Moreover, there are poisonous snakes lurking on both sides, jackals hiding, and man-eating tigers and leopards spying. — Dangerous! Truly dangerous! This journey that has been walked.</p>
<p>But, isn't the road ahead the same? The thorns are higher and denser, denser and sharper, and there are still poisonous snakes, jackals, tigers, and leopards hiding on both sides; where will I go with my scarred and broken body?</p>
<p>Wandering in the middle, I can only wait quietly for death to come; retreating to the original road, why did I bother to endure this pain and suffering in the first place? Now the only way out is to move forward, forward, constantly forward!</p>
<p>I looked around and silently murmured in loneliness:</p>
<p>— Night will surely pass; dawn will surely be born.</p>
<p>All the will-o'-the-wisps suddenly disappeared.</p>

<h3>Notes on 1935 American New Cars</h3>
<p>— Dun Ne</p>
<p>Not many changes in style and mechanism</p>
<p>Two major goals: economy and comfort</p>
<p>Time passes so quickly. The year 1935 is already upon us. Not to mention anything else, just in terms of changes in car styles, many new cars are launched on the market at the end of the year and the beginning of the year. Customers get rid of the old and welcome the new, and they can't help but be busy again. Although it is only late autumn weather now, the engineers of European and American car factories are racking their brains to plan for next year's new cars. Some car factories have not only completed their plans, but even announced their prototype cars. However, most of the American manufacturers are currently in a state of intense activity. According to a report from Detroit, the center of American automobile manufacturing, at the end of last month, there is a general description of the changes in various cars for the coming year. The general idea is that 1935 cars will not have significant changes in style and mechanism. The price will be as low as possible in order to promote car sales and expand the market.</p>
<p>American-made cars are roughly divided into three categories in terms of price. One type is expensive cars, with high prices. One type is mid-priced cars, which are slightly cheaper than high-priced cars. There is also the most common type of low-priced cars, which are specially supplied to the general public. Because these three types of cars have different prices, the styles and mechanisms are inevitably different. It is said that among the new cars of 1935, the mid-priced and high-priced cars will not have much change compared to the current 1934 models. It seems that they want to extend the life of the 1934 cars for another year. The reason for this is to maintain the current selling price and not increase it, so that the future of the automobile industry can improve.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to make more reforms and improvements to a car. However, these changes, such as changes in style and improvements in power, all require extra money. In the end, this money will inevitably be added to the customers. If business is booming and purchases are strong, even if the car price increases a little, it can still be sold. However, if the goods are not selling well and the sales are sluggish, then difficulties will arise. If you want to promote sales, customers will hesitate to buy because of the price, so the factory has to reduce the selling price in order to get rid of the stock. Such increases and decreases in price are actually very troublesome. Not only that, but sometimes it will also lose the customers' trust, as if going back on your word and the factory is indecisive, causing disappointment to the buyers. Therefore, the American mid-priced and high-priced car factories, in order to avoid the various troubles of increasing prices due to changes in style and mechanism and repeating the original price due to sluggish sales, simply take a wait-and-see approach for a year. For the new cars of 1935, they take a conservative and prudent attitude, and do not hope for obvious innovations in order to compete for short-term gains.</p>
<p>Speaking of low-priced cars, the situation is somewhat different. The competition between factories is very fierce. It can be said that each factory shows its ingenuity and unique ideas. Therefore, how the new cars of next year will change is still difficult to say for the time being. However, significant changes are indeed inevitable. There are three large factories in the United States that produce low-priced cars. These three are almost household names and do not need to be introduced. They are now "building cars behind closed doors". In the late winter and early spring, they will "show their faces" to everyone. At that time, there will inevitably be a lot of excitement. Now, according to the plan, the engineers and experts of these cars claim that most of the design work is almost ready. However, their work is still very busy and it seems that it will not be completed until the end of the year. Therefore, people generally speculate that these new cars will probably meet everyone at the end of this year. When the new year arrives and everything is revived, these cars with the largest sales and the best value will inevitably be active again.</p>
<p>The number of car sales is also very related to time. There are several periods of the year when car sales are very good, and there are also several periods when they are somewhat inferior. Taking this year as an example, three quarters have already passed, and only winter remains. The most prosperous time for car sales is in the early summer months of January and February. After late autumn, the peak of sales has passed and it gradually declines. The closer it gets to the time when new cars are about to be launched, the more sluggish the sales of various cars become. The reason for this is that customers who buy cars at this time are unwilling to buy a new car rashly. They must wait until the grand automobile exhibition is over before deciding on their choice. Therefore, in the months of October and November, the period of seasonal decline has arrived. Car dealers cannot have very extravagant hopes. It is estimated that the total number of American cars produced this year will be around 2,800,000.</p>
<p>Ford's production plan is almost independent of other companies. Therefore, the design and manufacture of new cars can be improved as much as possible. It is said that the new model of its 1935 car will be seen by the public in November of this year. The new model of the Packard truck has already appeared a month ago. Studebaker was even earlier than Packard. It has already shown its appearance to the public this summer. There are also many of them circulating on the market now. The new products of other manufacturers will probably not be able to show their colors until January 1st next year.</p>
<p>The suspension of the National Automobile Exhibition gives the manufacturers great freedom. Because in previous years, as the meeting date approached, everyone inevitably worked day and night in order to produce new cars in time. Now that the opening has been delayed, there is plenty of time to plan everything. The biggest feature of the 1935 new cars and the biggest goal of everyone's research and reform is economy, safety and comfort. As for speed and power, the current various cars are already very capable of dealing with them.</p>
<p>According to an automobile manufacturer, "Automobile manufacturers are very clear that if the automobile business is to prosper, the only way to do it is to start with not increasing the selling price. Therefore, the reason why this year's manufacturers are not prepared to make strong changes is to lower the selling price. If a car is to be changed to a new model, the selling price will increase a lot as a result." After hearing these words, we can understand why each car factory is not prepared to make significant changes to the new cars. On the other hand, we can also speculate that the general economic recovery is not as satisfactory as expected.</p>
<p>Among the three most popular low-priced cars on the market, the competition between two of the car companies is fierce, and the reform is also diligent. Almost every time a new car is launched on the market, there are always some new tricks to offer to the public. They will never be unknown in the past. Therefore, Ford Motor Company is constantly improving its new products. One of them is said to be born in November of this year. Everyone believes that this new car is generally very light and slightly streamlined in form.</p>
<p>Chevrolet has been planning its new car for six months. Speaking of the style of its car body, it seems to be almost like a semi-streamlined LaSalle. As for the new Chevrolet's engine, whether it will continue to have six cylinders or adopt eight light cylinders is still undecided. Therefore, outsiders have no way to speculate. Both straight-six and V-eight engines have been manufactured and tested in the Chevrolet factory.</p>
<p>Next year's Plymouth new car will be larger in style. The motor used has been greatly changed, so the power has also increased a lot. As for the streamlining of the appearance, it is always a little worse than its United Branch products, the DeSoto and Chrysler. The Walter P. Chrysler is said to have major changes in style. The reforms of other cars are probably not many. The accessories of next year's new cars will also be improved in order to increase sales. The shortcomings of the 1934 cars that have been discovered over the past year will be remedied. In short, the biggest goal is to strive for a beautiful style with a little streamlining.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Hillman New Car</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Taking "Safety First"</p>
<p>As the principle of construction</p>
<p>Recently, people in the automotive industry often tell each other that the British automotive construction skills and mechanical engineering genius can be seen from the various styles of the newly released Hillman cars. I have tasted the general public. Therefore, there are many notable features of Hillman's theory. Therefore, even if we occasionally take a look, we will know its quality. Excellent and outstanding, it is not comparable to ordinary similar products. According to the past twelve months, the factory has not made any major innovations for Hillman's new cars. However, its various improvements have greatly contributed to comfort and modern driving pleasure. As far as the current car situation in the city is concerned. Then this kind of progress is not very shallow.</p>
<p>The new car is currently on display in the sample room of Fulin Automobile Company on Daxilu Road. The machinery is sophisticated and the construction is ingenious. It is indeed a masterpiece of British products. All the manufacturing, no matter the size, is based on "safety first". It is an unbreakable principle. The all-steel frame is equipped with an all-steel body. They complement each other and are extremely strong. In addition, the automatic spring organization used for the car body device can be automatically calibrated to the appropriate degree regardless of the load. Therefore, the road surface is trembling and tilting. The troubles are completely eliminated invisibly. The person who is in the car feels like sitting on an easy chair. It feels very comfortable and comfortable. As for the arrangement, even beginners can easily handle it. Because the gears it is equipped with are harmonic. The new ventilation system is another important feature of the Hillman new car. Whether it is cold or summer, it can be adjusted at will. Enjoy the extreme refreshment without feeling any discomfort from the wind or stuffiness. This is especially commendable. It is the Hillman's unique lining device. This was invented several years ago. Today it has become a standard feature of Hillman. And because it has been improved many times. More perfect. Therefore, the so-called lining force device. The greatness of its effect is unmatched by all other shock absorbers. It has been generally recognized. There is no doubt. The front and rear seats of the Hillman are very spacious. The various styles produced are extremely spacious and comfortable. This is because of the re-arrangement of the pads, footrests, etc. It is extremely ingenious.</p>

<p>— Fu</p>
<p>According to Hankou communications, the Hubei Provincial Construction County has actively promoted construction in the province. Highways have been completed one after another. The number of trucks used has increased sharply. Therefore, gasoline has become a major daily expense. In order to save money and avoid false consumption. In order to do so, a collection of various freight cars used on each road was made. On Wednesday of last week, each vehicle's local sales company drove the car to a place about ten miles away from Huangpi. To measure the gasoline consumption of each vehicle.</p>
<p>This measurement was presided over by the Jian Department. The organization is strict. The handling is serious. Therefore, the result is very reliable. Every freight car participating in the measurement. Before the start of the measurement, a specified weight carefully weighed. Loaded on it. By the time the gasoline in the gasoline tank is cleared. And the engine is driven. After the last drop of car fuel is exhausted by the carburetor. Then each with five gallons of gasoline. Store in the oil pool. Officially set off. During the race, a special car from the Jian Department led the way. Always maintain its speed at 30 miles per hour. The vehicles participating in the competition. Then follow closely behind. Line up. There is a considerable distance between each car. And another special car hall behind it. As for the supply car, it is far away at a certain distance. And arrived at Huangdian Village. Stop for food. And after taking pictures. Then return. So it should be like all cars. The gasoline is exhausted. The engine suddenly stopped. If you don't add fuel, you can't move forward. Then the special car of the Jian Department. Detailed inspection of the mileage traveled by each car. As a result, the Chevrolet truck performed best. A total of five gallons of gasoline. 67 miles of travel. The average fuel consumption per gallon is 13.4 miles.</p>
<h3>A General Overview of the 1935 Auburn New Car</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Two Major Groups: Eight-Cylinder and Six-Cylinder</p>
<p>A Total of Eight Styles</p>
<p>The 1935 Auburn new car has now been released for use by people from all walks of life. The new cars are divided into two major groups, each with four styles, namely sedan, convertible sedan, brougham, and convertible sedan roadster. The Auburn eight-cylinder car has a wheelbase of 127 inches and 115 horsepower. The six-cylinder version has a wheelbase of 120 inches and 85 horsepower. Both groups of new cars emphasize streamlining, but there are no dramatic changes in their appearance. The design of the front and engine hood of the new cars is particularly exquisite and captivating. Auburn products were originally divided into standard and luxury groups, but the factory no longer uses this method for the 1935 models. This is because each style of the new car is fully equipped. The headlights and radiator grilles of the new cars are all chrome-plated, shining brightly and pleasing to the eye. All the conveniences for passengers are complete, allowing you to do whatever you want while in the car, with extreme ease. The car body is longer and lower, making the space more spacious. The front seats are particularly wide, now allowing three people to sit side by side, which is also extremely comfortable. The new low-pressure shock absorbers and air-cushioned rubber brackets eliminate or minimize the impact of all bumps. The dual-ratio rear axle reduces engine speed while the car continues to travel at high speed. This equipment can be installed on both groups of cars, but it requires additional payment. The latest ventilation system features divided windows on the front doors and movable windows on the rear doors. The engine uses lead cylinder heads, providing abundant power and enhanced performance. The valve operation and cooling system have made great progress. Notably, the power plants installed in both groups of new cars are extremely economical. All oil purifiers, air purifiers, mufflers, mechanical fuel pumps, and heat exchangers are fully equipped. The car body is made of pure steel</p>

<p>, making it extremely safe. Even all noises are prevented from occurring. The driving panel is also made of steel and is an integral part of the car body. In short, every part of the new car has been carefully researched and designed, so it can be safely asserted that it will be welcomed everywhere.</p>
<h3>Reduction in Car Accident Cases in the UK</h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>—An Average of Two Fewer Deaths Per Day—</p>
<p>Car accidents are a major problem in the UK that is difficult to solve. The government is sparing no effort to ensure safety in transportation. Recently, the Minister of Transport, Mr. Hore-Belisha, gave a public broadcast speech, stating that in the past three months, namely July, August, and September, the number of road accidents resulting in death has decreased compared to the past, even compared to the same period in 1933. According to the statistics available to Mr. Hore-Belisha at the time, the reduction reached 6.5%. In terms of numbers, there were approximately 140 fewer deaths.</p>
<p>However, according to on-the-spot inquiries, the numbers reported by Mr. Hore-Belisha are still below the actual numbers. In the three months of July, August, and September this year, the actual number of deaths caused by cars was 175 fewer than the same period last year, or 8%. Therefore, in terms of days, in this quarter, the number of deaths caused by car accidents in the UK has decreased by about two people per day. According to past experience, the three months of July, August, and September are usually the most dangerous period of the year, with a higher incidence of fatal accidents than at other times. Moreover, at the beginning of this year, there were more car accidents than in the same period last year, so the current results are particularly commendable.</p>
<p>According to the authorities, the reduction in car accident cases in the UK is due to the implementation of road safety policies and the public's attention to road safety issues promoted by the Ministry of Transport. The Minister of Transport often publishes the number of road accident cases to inform the public and constantly encourages people to pay attention to road safety. The figures are published per 100,000 people in each city, allowing for comparison. As a result, the authorities and the public in each city have to use the most effective methods to reduce the number of accidents, as the existence of such facts is a flaw for each city.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transport publishes weekly reports on road accident cases occurring in the suburbs of London, using statistical methods to clarify the location, cause, and result of the tragedies. According to Mr. Hore-Belisha, this method is quite effective in solving this problem. However, it is unfair to compare towns without considering the size of their population or area. Nevertheless, the greatest benefit of this statistic is to promote the joint attention of the local police and the Ministry of Transport to the locations where accidents occur and to concentrate their efforts to solve and prevent them. If each location can benefit from this statistic and address it with genuine dedication, then a significant reduction in road accident cases is to be expected. In fact, the results of studying statistics often reveal that certain types of accidents frequently occur in certain locations or venues. Thus, the constant presence of danger can be addressed at any time. For example, the cause of the accident can be investigated, whether it is due to the improper laying of tram tracks, the dangers of road intersections, or dark corners of the road, and can be resolved one by one.</p>
<p>The Minister of Transport is also planning a method of implementation, intending to have local authorities learn methods of reducing road accident cases from maps. These maps have already been posted for use, clearly indicating where car accident cases are most likely to occur. The newly formed Road Safety Committee will also use these maps to achieve the most detailed statistical methods and their practical effectiveness. Some people involved in the automotive industry find the regulations set by the public to be annoying, but these regulations do contribute to the prosperity of the automotive industry. Some leaders in the automotive industry believe that the more car accidents are reduced, the more people will buy cars. Therefore, they often provide great assistance in promoting the implementation of measures to curb car accidents.</p>
