<p>時評</p>
<h3>意奥匈三國會議與中歐和平</h3>
<p>方今意奥匈三國在羅馬會議之際。外電傳來。中歐局面。似益紛雜。不僅奥之復辟謠傳。德與小恊約之備戰之消息。皆甚囂塵上。卽意大利增兵北陲與小恊約相勾結。希脫拉磨厲以須。與南斯拉夫相接近諸說。亦復言之鑿鑿。意奥匈三國會議果爲經濟會議與否。言人人殊。莫衷一是。若此錯綜複雜鈎心鬥角之局面。果將釀成第二次大戰耶。小恊約終將趨向於德方。抑毅然與意相携手耶。或仍仰法國之鼻息耶。意之行動英法能默視耶。抑將引起更大之波瀾耶。此皆値得注意之問題也。</p>
<p>然吾人綜合事實。衡論時局。則知中歐之情勢。雖甚緊張。而尙未至大戰爆發之程度也。蓋中歐各國之矛盾。爲大戰後之和約所造成。訂約迄今。各國間之緊張局勢。已數見不鮮。然皆能復趨於平靜。良以戰禍再起。犧牲太大。故皆不敢甘爲戎首。輕易啓釁。顧此等和約。一日不修正。則歐洲之戰機亦必一日不絕。戰機不絕。則早晚必有爆發之一日。一經爆發。便爲大戰。歐洲各國終不免兩敗俱傷。試以今日而論。德若决意侵奥。戰事必起。奥若復辟。戰事亦不能免。設或意奥匈之結合爲政治的而非僅爲經濟的。則戰事尤不可免。</p>
<p>總之有一於此。戰事卽可爆發。蓋德而侵奥。足以威脅意大利。尤不利於捷克。故意捷必參戰。此時之戰。將成德與奥意捷之戰。奥而復辟。雖有利於意大利。特不利於德國之希脫拉與小恊約。故德與小恊約必同時並舉。向奥進逼。此時之戰。奥匈意爲一集團。德與小恊約或可爲另一集團。希脫拉之反對奥匈復辟。蓋恐其合併奥國建設「第三帝國」之慾望不能實現耳。小恊約之所以反對奥匈復辟。以小恊約之土地。太半皆戰前奥匈帝國之故土。而小恊約各民族。又皆歷受哈布士克皇室奴隸宰割之痛苦。設復辟而成。則日思解脫和約束縳之奥匈。勢將藉意大利之奥援。而作規復失地之預備。故共恐恢心理。自較德國爲甚。證諸已往之事實。無庸致疑。如一九二一年三月廿七。哈布士克皇系之却爾司蒞臨匈土僭登王位之時。捷克羅馬尼亞南斯拉夫卽恊同進兵侵匈。不三旬而却爾司重復出走。小恊約政治經濟之同盟。亦肇基於此時。去年二月小恊約公約成。此三國結合。乃更進一步。其最著者卽爲三國外交恊調。經濟合作。幾與同一國家無殊。是皆由顧慮奥匈復辟之心所促成也。故今日之奥匈。不復辟則已。復辟則小恊約之進攻。必將先德國而行之。若然。則意德二國。當難坐視。故奥而復辟。戰事必不能免。然奥不復辟戰事能免乎。此則當視今日意奥匈之會議性質爲經濟的抑爲政治的而定。設爲經濟的。則不過意爲奥匈　一經濟的出路。當爲各方所能容忍。設爲政治的。則有改變中歐今日疆域之嫌疑。自必引起小恊約之反抗。且將招致法英之干涉。故墨索里尼若率意行之。亦足使戰事爆發也。</p>
<p>唯就現勢以觀。墨索里尼似不至於魯莽若此。墨氏屢謂此一會議之範圍。僅限經濟。不及政治。同時又有擴大會議。羅致小協約之說。可知墨氏之意。僅在對德。固不欲使小協約感覺不安也。且意大利爲四强公約之發起國。自不能舍四强公約所規定之修約途徑。而逕與奥匈私議中歐之疆界問題。故此一會議。當不至惹起小協約之敵意。唯欲拉攏小協約。使之加入意奥匈之結合。亦甚非易易。蓋小協約若能與奥匈謀經濟之合作。則多瑙河流域之經濟問題。早可得相當之解决。固不待今日之意大利爲之倡導也。試觀脫里亞農和約。明明規定捷克可與奥匈作五年之經濟合作。特以民族間之水火鑿枘。猜忌嫉妒。此一條文。終成虚設。前年法國亦曾有多瑙經濟合作之計劃。亦以小協約不願就範及德意欲擴大範圍而失敗。據此推測。可知此後小協約必難加入意奥匈之結合也。今後之小協約。旣不便依附意大利。亦不便與德相親。以勢推之。除自謀團結外。恐仍不免與法沆𤅈一氣耳。</p>
<p>一言以蔽之。歐洲戰禍之爆發與否。以德意奥三國政策爲關鍵。德能度德量力。愼重將事。戰禍可免。意若無意改變中歐疆界。戰禍亦可免。奥若不行復辟。戰禍當更無由而發也。</p>

<h3>意大利抱有雄心</h3>
<p>德外長負重要使命悄然赴羅馬</p>
<p>羅馬　意奥匈三國總揆之三頭會議、星期四下午有較重要之進展、意王今晨在皇宫欵二貴賓以盛宴、午後三總揆在「維利乍宫」中舉行第一次會議、對「墨索里尼之政策」作一充份之討論、其目的在保持奥匈二國經濟與政治之獨立、並在多瑙河上流造成意大利之勢力範圍、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　德外長牛賴特昨日悄然離柏林而赴羅馬、聞將訪晤意相墨索里尼籌商關於國社黨之對奥事件、此行之目的、係與意相及奥總理杜爾夫斯匈總理貢博斯會商德奥之現狀、聞德外長此行尙將討論其他問題云、茲據可靠消息、謂牛氏此行、負有德總理希特勒之重要使命、將與意想會商至必要時德國可於退出國聯之二年内、再度加入國聯云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬　意匈奥三國總揆今日繼續在羅馬集議、恊商輔助匈奥、以抑德國國社黨併呑二國之狡謀、據稱德國副總理巴本氏亦將於星期四蒞會、說明德國之立場、以鞏固德國之地位、據今日此間消息、墨索里尼首相提議以「的里雅斯得」及「阜姆」爲德奥德匈之自由區、墨氏此舉、目的有二、第一在皮壞德國對於匈奥二國出口貨物之操縱、第二在恢復「的里雅斯得」與「阜姆」二埠間鐵道運輸之優先權給予奥國、以便與維也納通至漢堡間之鐵道與德國相競爭、按維也納通至漢堡之鐵道、爲匈奥兩國通至北部口岸之要途云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬　首相墨索里尼昨日曾與匈牙利總理貢博斯會談、今日又與奥國陶爾斐斯總理會晤、但三人至今尙未同時集會、據一般人之意、三國談話結果、不過發表共同宣言、將三國間友誼關係、從新予以說明、並非訂立政治性質之恊定、至於經濟方面、大約三國總揆不致訂立具有確定性質之恊定、如商務條約之類、其所計畫者爲一種並無三角性質之組織、成立之後、其他各國如捷克德國等皆可加入、又三國爲多瑙河流域國家經濟改組問題、現亦力求成立諒解、此項工作係以去年九月二十九日意國備忘錄爲依據、按意國政府曾向四强公約簽字國及繼承舊奥匈帝國而獨立之各國（卽奥匈捷克南斯拉夫）送致節略、建議依照前年斯德勒柴會議所决定之辦法、實行多瑙河流域各國經濟改組、並加以擴充、對於多數農産品一律適用云、（十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>前日上午</p>
<h3>舉行預備會議</h3>
<p>商定經濟談判基礎</p>
<p>修約問題不致議及</p>
<p>倫敦　羅馬昨未有重要消息傳出、意奥匈三國總揆定今日午後開第一次正式會議、以討論如何保障奥匈經濟上與政治上之繼續的獨立、昨已舉行預備會議、其最重要者、爲午前意相與奥總理之晤談、聞討論意奥間稅則優待與限額之辦法、及奥匈在特利斯特與阜姆兩處所可享受之便利、聞意國願多購奥國機器與工業出品、而奥國願多購意國農産、尤其是酒類、至於糧穀則不擬多購、因奥國將購糧於匈國也、匈總理昨晨亦與奥總理作長談談後往見駐意德大使、</p>
<p>昨夜奥總理對新聞記者稱、聯合的計劃、現在籌議中、耶穌復活節以前、當可宣佈云、聞修約問題昨日未曾議及、卽在今日會議中亦未必議及之、</p>
<h3>下午參觀騎兵操演午後</h3>

<p>奥内衛軍集中待命</p>
<p>（倫敦）　多瑙河諸國對於意國軍火運入匈國之說、大爲惶駭、維也納官塲雖已力闢此說、但傳言不息、據謂有滿裝軍火之火車兩列、於三月八九兩日穿越奥境而入匈境云、南斯拉夫國京城報紙且謂軍火由意入奥、確有證據、意國有此舉動、而欲小恊約國參加經濟合作、不可得也、現擬請國聯統制奥匈軍備云、匈京官塲指此謠言全無根據、匈國各報謂此謠言發源於小恊約國、以破壞羅馬目前談判爲目的云、奥總理杜爾夫斯刻在羅馬、奥内衛團領袖乃於昨日在维也納整理其部屬、聞欲集中所有兵力、於副總理費少佐之下、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>奥國復辟運動</h3>
<p>鬥爭方式不軼法律範圍</p>
<p>但求王室復位反對奥匈合一</p>
<p>維也納　奥國保王黨正統派領袖之一魏斯奈向此間奥國及外國報紙代表說明哈布斯堡皇室復辟問題之現狀、魏氏切實聲明奥國禁止舊皇室入境之命令一旦取消、則皇室將立卽返居本國、又謂正統派所用鬥爭方法、絕不軼出法律範圍之外、對於奥匈兩國實行君合制度之主張加以拒絕、因正統派所求者、僅係奥國皇位故也云云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>堅持監察制下實行裁軍</p>
<p>法覆英照會延至下週杪送出</p>
<p>（倫敦）　艾登爵士今日在下院聲稱、自彼歷訪歐洲各國當局後、益信軍縮會議之成敗、須視各國能否接受英國之計劃爲轉移、英國之計劃則已於最近送交各國之軍縮備忘錄中詳言之矣、艾氏對於工黨攻撃政府言論之答辦、則甚爲沉痛、工黨以爲政府對於於軍縮會議實缺乏决斷與瞭解、因此引起外間對於戰爭之恐懼、艾氏繼稱、政府對於意法德各國之覆文、定能以同情與瞭解的態度以研究之、政府並深信世界各國决不願軍縮會議之失敗、艾氏又云、以余在巴黎柏林羅馬所聞、使余益信軍縮會議成功之恊定、舍英國軍縮備忘錄莫屬、强氏則責備西門外相、謂西門對於美國軍縮建議、表示冷淡態度、西門則否認此說、並稱美國對於軍縮事、從未作與德國立於平等地位之任何考慮云、外間稱美國不願與各國合作、以求軍縮會議之成功、艾氏則指此說爲無稽、艾氏宣稱、在軍縮討論中、美國對於條約之起草爲助實多、軍縮會議足資鼓勵吾人之一點、卽英美兩國之密切合作耳、觀察者則信英美日三國將凖備歷史從未有過之海軍大競爭、以言造艦計劃、當然捨美國莫屬、然美國戰艦已不合時用、故美國能否居於領袖之地位、殊可疑也、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英掌璽大臣艾登今日在下院述其游歐促進軍縮之經過、言下頗具樂觀、謂法德雙方意見不易融洽、但在其答覆英國提議之文未全收到時、今尙未可遽作悲觀云、某議員詢以設法擬調和法德意見是否無望、艾登答曰否、並不失望、艾登又稱、形容失實、乃一錯誤、如軍縮會議失敗、則動搖者不僅爲歐陸諸國之安全、而英國之安全亦將瀕於危境、蓋軍縮會議失敗後、各國必亟於重整軍備、而英國尤然、以英國已自動的解除軍備甚多也、渠以爲英國縱將其軍備增多數倍、亦未必能獨自保證英國之安全、何哉、以軍備彼此競爭、將終無安全可言也、况所急需者、爲以英國提議爲根據之公約、及國聯完全權威之恢復、而將西歐各大國悉羅列其中、英政府對於各國覆英國提議之文、定予以同情考慮、而抱各國未有願軍縮會議破裂者之信心云、艾登言及普魯士邦總理戈林所發「普魯士精神終將支配德國前途」一語、謂渠爽直的凖備承認軍事國與黷武主義國兩者之區别、但渠覺以英國人民視之、戈林此語、屬於黷武主義國之成分、較屬於軍事國者爲多云、（聞者鼓掌）</p>
<p>艾登言畢、下院各議員乃開始國外事件之辯論、邱吉爾首先發言、謂政府如以爲麥唐納首相之計劃、可爲人所接受、則直自欺耳、今外交政策之大危險、爲吾人之要求法國削弱其軍備、國聯下國際軍隊之組織、乃不可能事、不過各國軍隊或可因特殊原因、互相聯絡、而予世界以安全耳云、工黨威志英稱、艾登之意極佳、但鑒於德國野心家之目的、渠覺艾登之努力稍失時效云、自由黨薩繆爾稱、德國黷武主義之復活、已置歐洲於可怖的進退維谷之境、歐洲其將默認其發展、直至發生世界慘刦之時乎、抑將不承認其地位平等、而制止其發展乎云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>外相西門結束辯論、略謂「軍縮一般公約、若不能成功、則吾人當設法就西歐各國訂立空軍恊定、但英國勢逼處此、吾人决不令談判長日拖延、永無止境、今之所重者在於迅速行動、如較好之解决方法終於絕望、則吾人惟有就時勢所能發生之結果、爲英國計算、以期迅速應付時勢之需要耳」、西門相信暗中重整軍備之辦法、爲害甚大、故又謂以渠所見、「軍縮公約縱不完備、然較之全無公約、固勝百倍也」云云（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　衆議院外交委員會、對於外交情形交換意見之後、提出一種决議案、由全體通過、棄權者僅一人、此項决議案、内容如下、（一）仍照向來政策、贊成在國際監察之下、實行裁軍、但須在有組織之安全條件下行之、（二）繼續反對德國重整軍備、（三）極端希望訂立一般軍縮公約、如不能訂立公約時、則以限制軍備爲目標而訂立公約、以免各國又爲軍備競爭、而危害和平、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　負責方面消息、法國答英國軍縮說帖之覆文、或可於下星期底送出、此覆文之措詞、以不關閉將來解决之門户爲主旨、聞將追認前外長巴爾都二月十日致軍縮會主席漢德森函中所載之一般條件、法國亟願軍縮討論不致流産、深望此次覆文可便利最後恊定、但法國最低需要、即安全與有效的軍備管理兩點、尙待英國諒解、前途各事悉繋於此云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>利用軍縮失敗機會</p>
<h3>俄向和平進攻</h3>
<p>將建議訂普遍不侵犯公約</p>
<p>促進對法邦交陷日於孤立</p>
<p>（倫敦）　關於今日每日電聞報披露軍縮談判失敗後之蘇俄「和平進攻」計畫之内容、每日電聞報素以外交消息靈通見稱、據該報所載、蘇俄主張訂一普遍之不侵犯公約、另附以制裁侵略者之互助公約、至於侵略之界說、則仍以去夏在倫敦簽訂之八國公約爲藍本、蘇俄希望藉此可使日本更陷於孤立、蓋以日本不願參加此類公約也、蘇俄更希望藉此促進對法邦交、蓋以法國可望歡迎蘇俄之建議也、至於英國則因此約有裁制之規定、大約不致參加、以免加重其責任、（十四日國民電）</p>

<h3>說明日俄形勢</h3>
<p>謂尙未到嚴重關頭</p>
<p>（東京）　本日之衆議院、首由政友會之長島隆二氏關於减少本年度之滿洲事件預備費案提出質問後、復對於滿俄國境關係有所質疑、林陸相答辯如左、</p>
<p>倘僅就滿俄國境關係之現狀觀之、似乎蘇俄頗有積極行動之傾向、但不能因此卽謂蘇俄進行攻勢凖備、蓋尙無任何事實以資證明也、</p>
<p>在滿蘇國境方面最前綫活動之蘇俄人員、或射落日本飛機、或時常出没於朝鮮境内、其越軌行動固當認爲事實、然日本與蘇俄之政治與外交上之關係、現在尙未達到嚴重情形、殊覺不足爲慮、</p>
<p>至於滿洲事件費、乃爲維持滿洲治安所使用之欵項、倘一千萬圓尙不足濟事之際、仍當要求追加預算也云云、（十五日聯電）</p>

<p>棉業談判决裂後</p>
<h3>英日均主審愼</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　據經濟財政通信社宣稱、藍開厦棉業代表團昨日曾與貿易大臣倫西曼之代表威爾孫爵士會晤、該代表團現正預備向政府呈遞報告書、該報告書將建議若干種應採之措置、但一般人相信此種措置不至過分操切、英國政府並不主張對於輸入日貨之關稅施以差别待遇、或規定限制日貨輸入之數額、蓋如增加日貨輸出稅、則在若干英國殖民地内、本地物價勢必騰貴、且英政府之目的在於復興藍開厦棉布之輸出貿易、如採關稅政策、則與此種目的背道而馳、至於日本方面亦力持審愼、不欲陷入政治經濟之孤立地位、因此預料英日兩國間直接談判尙有可爲、聞貿易大臣倫西曼不久卽將會見日本駐英大使、有所商談云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>倒閣運動又烈</h3>
<p>齋藤决訪元老西園寺</p>
<p>（東京）　非常時期之預算其總數竟達到二十一億一千二百萬元之巨額、並於十四日宣告成立、故政府努力使重要法案通過、兩院或無須延長會期、而可告結束、尤宜傾其全力於貴族院、以便促成、但議會閉會期限旣已迫近、同時政界内、幕之策動、亦漸形劇烈、院内之空氣與院外之倒閣運動斷難樂觀、政府故决於議會閉幕後、由齋藤首相訪唔西園寺公爵、以便陳述處置將來之政局、而圖改造内閣、藉使政局得以安定、但以客觀情形察之、則齋藤内閣之壽命延長頗屬疑問也云云、（十五日日聯電）</p>

<h3>紙幣兌現經過</h3>
<p>公裕已兌出十分之八</p>
<p>縣府標賣四票商財産</p>
<p>徐州通訊、年前澎湃一時之徐埠紙幣潮、在佘前縣長時代、曾限令衆商合組之公裕銀號、充分兌現、當由公裕股東、集資開兌角票、終以現欵難籌、旋卽停兌、王公璵接任縣長以來、力謀澈底清理之方、代負責任、向銀行界爲公裕抵借三萬元、卜信記二萬元、益貞祥一萬元、於是此三家遂於年前開兌、惟春泉·天保育·世興昌·聚和昌·四家、以信用無担保、莫能抵押、刻正從事於標賣該四家之財産、以爲有折扣之初次兌現、迄今七家銀號、已可入於全部解决之途、私幣亦可望從此絕跡、茲分紀辦理開兌經過情形如次、</p>
<p>三家開兌經過　公裕銀號爲本埠大小商店合組、卜信記爲南關道平路之大雜貨棧、益貞祥爲東站中正街之酒油槽坊、而公裕有股東中之巨商負責、卜信記益貞祥則除所有産業外、尙有其親友私人爲之參加負責、是以能得銀行之見信、更加縣政府以行政之力量訂約担保、乃分别借到現欵、業於年前先後無限制開兌、廢曆年終市面之稍見鬆動、胥賴於此、公裕三萬元、卜信記兩萬元、益貞祥一萬元、至今已兌出約十分之八、當初開兌時、每日均有巨量之兌出、年關而後、寥若晨星、刻下城埠商民、已無該三家存票、卽鄉村農民、或距徐較遠者、所持之票、爲數當亦不鉅、以此推測、有此六萬元之現欵、足可敷清理三家總額之需、公裕報告票額爲十四萬元、股東集資開兌角票時、業已收回若干、最初擠兌時、每日限制兌現、亦已收回若干、卜信記益貞祥兩號、出票本少、初經濟兌時之限制兌現、亦已收得不少、而兩月以來、與出票人有債權關係者、又紛紛以折扣購買紙票、充還賬清債之需、加以票紙在外、不無流落損毁、是以能以少量之欵、奏清理之效、刻下三家仍在續兌之中、此後可無問題發生、</p>
<p>標賣四家財産　春泉·天保育·聚和昌·世興昌·四家、以無信用担保而見拒於銀行、縣府亦莫能代爲負責、曾令四家號主、迅速自行設法、縣府仍處於援助之地位、無如四家迄今無策可籌、縣府以長此遷延、殊非事體、乃擬標賣其財産、惟就估値而論、則相差太巨、復擬定標賣之後、以所得之現金、按照總額之成分、折扣兌現、不過以此種債務、與普通欠債不同、不能以破産折扣了事、是以預定折兌之時、在原票上加章切角、仍由持票人保存、待票主續有財力時、再爲十足續兌、不特民衆不至吃虧、亦所以杜將來私幣之發生也、刻縣府已發佈告、清理四家財産、文云、一案查天保育·春泉·世興昌·聚和昌等四家票紙、久懸未决、影響民衆利益極大、本府一再嚴飭該四家票主、趕速籌集兌現、迄未遵行、茲爲速謀解决起見、對於該四家財産、積極清理、凖備票賣、以資兌現、凡關於該四家財産、除已經本府查封登記者外、或尙有隠匿示報者、茲限定兩星期内、准由市民檢舉、俾此問題、早日解决、仰各界民衆知照」、至於四家財産之查封登記者、計春泉有七區榆莊田地十二頃、蕭境孤山地八頃、天保育有五區王店田地二百十七畝、五區破橋田地三十五畝、一區史家莊西田地一百畝、舊道署街住房一所、電燈廠南住房一所、鴻廟城基地二畝、世興昌有五區小黄家田地三百畝、府公田三百三十五畝、州東巷住房二所、四道街市房一所、（廣春泉押）兩半坑住房一所、（萬華永押）府署街住房一所、（洪興永押）素和昌有七八區嚴家山田地五十畝、大廟地五十畝、王家山地一百五十畝、馬號鎭住房一所、（十四日）</p>

<p>怡和洋行南華班輪怡生號、係向香港挪威公司租用、原名爲Norviken由怡和公司承租後、卽改稱怡生號、行駛南華線、兼行青島、本月十一日、在滬滿裝紗布麵粉白米雜貨等、共計二萬餘件、並有運往汕頭荳餅一萬一千片、及乘客若干名、於中午離滬出口、</p>
<h3>海盜在滬下船</h3>
<p>該輪在滬起椗前、各盜喬扮乘客、混上輪船、昨據該行電報、悉海盜共有二十二人、於星期二（十三日）晨六時許、當船行抵福州海面時、各盜躍出、各執槍械、數盜躍上駕駛臺·及無線電室·等處、將船員驅至一室、派盜監視、並將無線電天線割斷後、抛入海内、方開始搜刦、船員乘客、無一幸免、並開艙刦取客貨、另有二盜、在駕駛臺、迫令船主、向大</p>
<p>鵬灣北其良地方開去（Chlang）（譯音）至十四日星期三下午三時、行至目的地、盜匪事前預先佈置、故船到該處、卽駛來盜船一艘、將所刦贓物、卸下盜船、</p>
<h3>乘客十人被擄</h3>
<p>總計盜匪刦掠時間、自十三日晨六時起、至十四日下午三時抵目的地止、沿途刦掠三十餘小時、臨去以所刦之物、不滿所慾、尙不甘心、復擄去乘客十名、被擄者姓名及艙内刦去客貨、現正在調查中、故來電未詳、</p>

<h3>將成立籌備處</h3>

<p>飛行社成立及天廚號命名典禮事宜、昨據中國航空恊會秘書長林我將氏談話、略謂、飛行社組織大綱等、均已草就、但該項組織、吾國尙係初創、一切計畫、尙須縝密考慮、業已專電蔣委員長請示、一俟中央批准後、卽可正式成立、惟爲便利進行起見、擬於本月十八日左右、先行成立籌備處、天廚號機命名典禮、决定於十八日在虹橋飛機塲舉行、政府已派航空署長徐培根代表來滬接受、行政院則派褚民誼氏代表出席參加、至於典禮秩序、首爲天廚號機命名禮、次爲杜月笙贈孫桐崗機禮、再次爲航空恊會接受天廚號機副號、及孫桐崗贈機禮、關於會場佈置及警戒交通等問題、航恊會徵求隊辦事處、定於今日下午四時、在八仙橋青年會、邀請市政府·公安局·公用局·保安處·及天廚廠等各方代表、會商一切云、南京電云、孫桐崗十五晚赴滬接受杜月笙贈之鵬程萬里號飛機、定十九晨由滬乘該機出發飛京、躭擱一日、卽駕原機返山東原籍、月底由魯飛贛謁蔣委員長請示、决六月初出國、</p>
<p>美飛行家</p>
<h3>霍克今晨赴粤</h3>
<p>所携巨型轟炸機由水道運杭</p>
<p>運輸裝配一月後再來滬表演</p>
<p>美飛行家霍克氏、携康道號巨型轟炸機來滬後、曾一度赴杭視察、已於前晚回滬、將於今晨七時許、乘中國航空公司飛機赴粤、至該康道號機、現因鐵路運輸有困難之點、將於星期日由水道運杭、配裝需時較多、據克特斯蘭德公司代表告新聲社記者、謂須三十日方可竣事、然後來滬表演、茲分誌之於次、</p>
<p>今晨飛粤　霍克到滬後、曾於日前隨克特士蘭德飛機公司駐滬代表泡雷氏赴杭視察、已於前晚由杭回滬、據泡氏昨告新聲社記者、彼二人將於今晨七時、由龍華乘中國航空公司滬粤綫南下班飛機赴粤、約一星期後再返滬、機師高爾斯氏並不同行、</p>
<p>陸運障碍　康道號飛機甚大、爲船艇、泡雷氏與霍克等、本擬携該機至杭州配裝、蓋以杭州飛機場、有較大之置機處、但滬杭鐵路上有橋樑鋼架較狹、該機置車上不能通過、因之遂發生問題、繼復欲將該機運至虹橋飛機塲裝置、而途中必經之南洋大學附近、橋樑至多、僅能容五噸重量之物通過、而康道機之最低重量、有十一噸、於是又不得行、又曾擬將該機運赴龍華飛機塲、運輸固無問題、奈該機塲之儲機室、康道號於裝置後、因機身增大、不能運出、故均不能裝配、</p>
<p>水路運杭　現悉該機已交由某運輸公司設法起運、據泡雷君告新聲社記者、現已决定於星期日、（卽後日）由水路運往杭州配裝、前後共需時三十日、方可竣事、然後來滬表演云、</p>

<p>銀行界公認</p>
<h3>應付銀價惟有增稅</h3>
<p>改用金本位計雖佳而難實現</p>
<p>我國因入超且不能禁銀出口</p>
<p>新聲社云、美國實行提高銀價、已漸影響於世界用銀國之商業、我國爲用銀國之一、亦不能例外、至應付之對策、昨日本埠外人方面、傳中國有主張乘此機會改用金本位制、然據新聲社記者向各方探悉、知政府並無此意、或係私人方面之意見、以之應付銀價高漲、固屬良策、然事實難以辦到、滬銀行界咸認應付之策、惟有增高銀出口稅、禁止出口、且不可能、蓋全國存銀現僅一萬五千萬、而外商握有全數三分之二、殊爲可驚也、茲分誌於次、</p>
<h3>改本位難辦到</h3>
<p>昨日本埠外國銀行界傳出消息、謂我國爲付美國提高銀價起見、現有意乘此機會、依照凱末爾改金本位計畫報告、實行改用金本位、俾中國之土産貨物、不受提高銀價之影響、蓋在用金國方面言之、提高銀價、卽係提高物價、中國如改爲金本位時、則中國之貨價、亦將隨銀價而提高、但據新聲社記者詢諸本國銀行界、知政府現無此意、認爲此種主張、或係私人方面意見、並謂此種主張、固不能謂爲不良、但事實上難辦到、蓋我國缺乏改用金本位之原料、卽爲最大難關、且耗費較大、更非中國經濟危殆之現時期所能辦到也、故凱末爾博士之報告、財部耗費經費百餘萬、至今只能視爲參考之資料耳、</p>
<h3>惟徵稅可應付</h3>
<p>改金本位旣難辦到、則應付提高銀價之方法、惟有增加相當之白銀出口稅、以資限制、現在滬銀行界要人、如貝淞蓀·徐寄廎·張公權·李馥孫·徐新六·以及林康侯等、俱同意此項主張、惟增加銀出口稅、須根據美國提高銀價之程度而增加、例如美國現在所提高銀價、與中國銀價相差爲百分之五、則我國徵收出口稅、亦須由原有之百分二·五元出口稅止、再加徵百分之五、使之平衡、但如銀價低落時、則出口稅亦須减低、以資限制、</p>
<h3>不能禁銀出口</h3>
<p>銀行界又對禁止白銀</p>
<p>出口事、認爲係不可能之事實、蓋禁銀出口、足使社會發生恐慌、故此事爲絕對不可能之事、蓋我國入超甚鉅、平均年達七萬萬、如禁銀出口、則此七萬萬入超、亦卽華商所購之外貨、將無以償付、且英美匯價益貴、而我國之銀價益跌、結果將引起極大之恐慌、而私運白銀者、又有宏利可圖、届時恐禁不勝禁、而白銀之流出、仍可得其自然、故此種主張、銀行界亦認爲不可能、</p>
<h3>外商存銀可驚</h3>
<p>昨據銀行界人宣稱、全滬存銀、連中外銀行及錢業併計、共一萬五千萬兩、而外商銀行、如匯豐銀行及麥加利銀行、等所存之白銀、竟占全數三分之二、卽一萬萬兩、其餘五千萬、爲華商所有、其中錢業方面、僅占五百萬、在華商者、固可保無慮、然在外商銀行者、難免流出、記者昨於探詢此項消息時、聞係全滬存銀一萬萬五千萬、旋據其他銀行界要人言、該一萬五千萬存銀、實係全國各地銀行集滬之總數也、</p>
<h3>造幣亦一善策</h3>
<p>此外銀行界對於用白銀趕鑄銀幣、藉以抵制銀之溢出事、認爲亦一良策、蓋已鑄成之銀幣、如再鎔爲白銀、運輸出口、則未免太不經濟、故白銀鑄成銀幣後、當不致流出、但造幣廠每日現僅鑄造二十餘萬、杯水車薪、未免無濟於事耳、</p>
<p>外人引水權</p>
<h3>並無條约規定</h3>
<p>中國引水公會發表消息</p>
<p>中央云、日來外間盛傳本埠領事團、因我國政府提出收回收水主權之整個辦法、認爲問題重大、曾召集會議討論其事、領團方面、主張引水主權、係内河航權之一部份、在内河航權未解决前、决難解决引水權問題、有各領已向本國請訓之說、茲據中國引水公會發表消息、略謂、我國引水主權、與内河航權、完全不同、截然兩事、緣外人之得充引水、其唯一根據、只有前清同治七年總稅務司赫德呈請總理衙門批准之引水章程、現在外人霸佔最大最重之上海南口引水公司、亦係根據上項章程而組織、不但本會存有該公司組織章程、卽政府中更有案可考、今無中生有、張冠李戴、殊爲牽强、查我國自有外人引水以來、助寇資敵、如塘沾馬江以及一二八之役、受害已不堪言、所以决心收回、以圖自保、况同治七年所批准者、並非條約、乃内政上一種官廳命令、今以後令變更前令、絕不受任何外力之干涉、故我方理由至爲充足、對方無法對付、所以牽連絕不相干之事、希圖擴大糾紛、以爲牽制、而無知者反爲傳播此項消息、以轉移國人心理、實爲可嘆、且據本會觀察、所有會議、不過表面文章、緣國府收回引水章程、已於去年九月間發表、各國果有反對之理由、何待於今日方生問題、深望國人嗣後對此加以注意、如外人所宣</p>
<h3>劉湘電闢日報誣衊</h3>
<p>元日電呈汪蔣陳說</p>
<p>國聞社云、本埠日文報日日新聞、對川事有誣衊紀載、四川剿匪督辦劉湘、因於本月十三日、電呈汪蔣報告、茲覓得原電披露於右、（銜略）勝密、頃上蔣汪兩公元電、文曰、昨據職部駐滬人員電稱、上海日日新聞記載川事、備極誣衊、對湘尤肆意攻訐、不曰懹抱野心、剪除異已、卽曰别有陰謀、不利中央、甚且謂湘勾結英法、謀築鐵路、以通片馬、凡諸蜚語、羗無故實、竊湘奉命剿匪、兼籌善後、仰荷鈞座裁成、欲拯川民於塗炭、材輇任重、隕越時虞、目撃地方殘破、人民流離之狀、尤覺寢饋難安、惟有努力進勦、奠安桑梓、以報殊遇、罔識其他、若夫縱横捭闔之與傾軋排擠之謀、尤湘平生所深惡而痛絕者、國勢陵夷、至斯已極、合力挽救、尙懼弗及、此中艱苦、又豈外間報紙所能體諒者哉、至於開發建設諸端、湘固有志於此、曾延請專門人材、考查地方藴藏、以爲將來開發富源之預備、平匪裁兵之消納、此善後應有之責、無所謂陰謀、亦無須勾結外人也、查上海日日新聞、乃日人所主辦、其肆意誣煽、固别有用心、而滬上各外報及某通信社、轉相附會、傳播日廣、誠恐衆口鑠金、眞僞莫辨、湘略陳梗概、伏祈垂察、無任屏營之至、等語、特達劉湘叩、元、</p>
<p>傳之引水有條約關係等說、不過一種烟幕彈而已、（下略）</p>

<p>黄災會災賑組</p>
<h3>定本月底結束</h3>
<p>所有經費移充工賑</p>
<p>中央社云、關於黄河水災救濟委員會災賑組事宜、昨晨中央社記者往訪該組主任席德炯氏於該會、據談、該會委員長孔祥熙氏、以經費困難、已電令該組、於三月底暫時結束、災賑工作、俾將所有經費從事於工賑、茲將災賑現狀等分誌如次、</p>
<h3>施賑機關暫時結束</h3>
<p>據席氏談、災賑組成立後、卽在魯冀豫三省災區設立查放局、並派員分赴各災區施賑、災黎獲救者爲數不少、用去欵項迄今共達一百餘萬元、該會委員長孔祥熙氏、以三省工賑尙未完工之時、派員施賑、事倍功半、且因該會經、濟困難故决定於三月底將災賑組暫時停止工作、俾將該會經費、盡行用之於工賑工作、俟三省黄河决口盡數堵塞竣工後、再視情形、以便施賑、該組奉令後、卽電知在三省所設之施賑機關、如災民招待所、施粥廠查放局等、於限期内次第結束、</p>
<h3>黄河北岸災民待救</h3>
<p>席氏繼談、三省災情、雖較前逐漸良好、但嗷嗷待救之災民、爲數仍多、黄河南岸災區、受災較輕、且决口早已堵竣、故已無問題、惟北岸災民、仍在水深火熱之中、亟待救濟者、爲山東之濮縣東昌·河北之長垣·河南之滑縣·延津·等九縣、情况仍極慘酷、良以北岸决口、面積廣大、故救濟之策、當先將决口堵塞、使黄水重入舊道、聞工賑組業已着手堵塞、期於短期内完工、</p>
<h3>災民移送西北開墾</h3>
<p>三省災區自經水災後、地方精銳、喪失殆盡、黄災會方面、决將該區待救之災民、分送各地、此項移送災民計畫决定後、當與送往地區之省方接洽、關於免費移送災民一事、業已與鐵道部接洽妥當、至將無家可歸之災民移送西北開墾、計甚良善、想能辦到云云、並悉席氏以災賑組結束在卽、故擬俟孔委員長由贛返京後、入京晋謁、面陳一切云、</p>

<h3>讀書問答</h3>
<p>再談關於文</p>
<p>學學習步驟</p>
<p>寫作及其他</p>
<p>—總答張一雁，巫恪循，潘鳳石，季李，程鐵生，鄭國欽諸君等</p>
<p>關於怎様研究文學這一問題，不久以前我們曾有過一次概要的討論。現在因爲仍有許多讀者來信，要求對這問題結予一個更明確的更具體的解答。特再提供幾點意見，作一次總答覆。</p>
<p>根據許多來信，我們看到在一般研究文學者的心目中認爲急待解决的，有着如下的三個最基本的問題：（一）什麽是我們所需要的文學？（二）怎様讀文藝書？（三）怎様創作？這三個問題，如果把它們連貫起來看，也可以說是研究文學的步驟。</p>
<p>（一）什麽是我們所需要的文學？當我們開始研究文學的時候，最先感到困難的，便是看到汗牛充棟的文藝書籍，要不知從何處讀起。其實，這是用不着煩惱的，如果我們對於「爲什麽要研究文學」，和「什麽是我們所需要的文學？」這兩個先决問題有了正確的回答，那困難便要不攻自破。我們知道：文學已不是專供文人雅士娱樂的東西，而是以形象（文字）表現某一特定社會生活的複雜性的東西。文學可以暴露某一社會的罪惡，文學可以描寫出新社會的進程，文學更可以提高人類生活的興趣。文學的藝術底價値，是配合着它的社會底價値來估定的；卽是說：某一時代的文學，在當時是最有價値的，而過了那時代，必然的價値便要减低。從這様的見地，顯明的我們要研究文學，旣不是爲了娱樂，也不是專想學點寫文章的技術，而是因爲我們想從文藝作品内、認識我們所處的社會活動的眞相；從文藝作品内，獲取我們目前的生活的資料。這様我們所需要的文藝，無疑地是那最切合現社會，最能替我們呼喊出目前生活的苦痛和指出生活的進程的作品了。有些人提出要讀古文觀止，我們的回答是：古文觀止决不是我們所需要的。中國的舊文學，和中國社會之沉淪於半建封狀態相配合，老是在形式内兜圈子。其遺留給我們的，實只有那些形式的殘骸。試問：唐宋八大家的文章，有那一篇和我們的現社會和生活發生關係？何况古文觀止的編者，硬把每篇文章的結構分成「起，承，轉，合，」而使之殭化，卽使你要研究古文，或者你想從那裏學點作文的技術，這也并不是一本很好的古文選集。其次，又有人提出要讀紅樓夢。我們的回答，同様是認爲不需要的。紅樓夢誠然是一部有價値的文藝作品，但它的價値是在它能把當時没落貴族的荒淫生活綜錯地表現出來的那一點。現在，社會已有變革，代替貴族而起的是軍閥，官僚，他們的荒淫殘暴，已不是如紅樓夢所描寫的。而另換了，新的姿態這様，紅樹夢所給予我們的，已經只有那性的刺激和誘惑。我們不是如少爺小姐那様有閒情逸緻的人，我們又那有心情去享受那官感上的娱樂。此外如現在流行的俠義小說和無聊的三角四角戀愛小說，均是不需要的。俠義小說是有意避開現實社會而引要想入非非。現社會是罪惡的，要改造這社會，只有社會的每一基木活動的細胞——卽是受痛苦最深的我們自已負起責任。但俠義小說指示我們的，却是要我們等待那些有義俠心腸，有呑彈吐劍之能的英雄來拯救。在世界上那類的英雄永不會有，於是我們便也只有永遠沉淪於呻吟痛苦中。這是一種欺騙，是一種麻醉！至於無聊的戀愛小說，其表現的形式雖與俠義小說不同，然而，它的作用，是没有兩様的。它不是避開現實而是歪曲現實，企圖以性的刺激來軟化我們所受的痛苦，來和緩我們對於現社會的指摘，也就是來阻住我們求生的前路。試問：在我們這艱苦的生活中，我們爲什麽要浪費時間和精力讀那些於我們無益而大有害的文藝作品呢？</p>
<p>如前面所說，我們所需要的文藝，必然的是那把生活的複雜性和豐富性，在現社會的進展的根源下，在肯定與否定的關鍵内，活生生地描寫出來的文藝。我們讀「阿Q正傳」，是因爲「阿Q正傳」不僅描繪出了一個在初期中國革命過程中農民的典型人物，而且描繪出了沉淪於半封建狀態的中國社會的全面目。我們讀「子夜」，是因爲「子夜」指示出了中國的工業資本，在農村破産和帝國主義傾銷的夾攻中必然崩潰的趨向。不過，在這裏我們應該注意到的，是在文化程度低落的我們中國，在新文化還不能得到充分發展機會的現在，比較富有社會意義的可讀的文藝作品，還是異常的貧乏。因此，我們便不能不借重那些從外國移譯過來的偉大著作。（當然外國作品，也有許多是無聊的。）在現在看，文學的園地，是没有國界的，猶之我們中國已再不能閉關自守一様。我們再不能存着偏見，不要再怕中國舊文學淪於滅亡，作如是看的人，不過是想盡他一分阻碍新文化發展之力量而已。認清了這些，我們對於選讀文藝書籍，當不致再感到困難了吧。（關於應讀的書，我們擬將來開一比較詳細的書目，在此恕不多及）</p>
<p>下面，便談到怎様讀文藝書的問題。</p>

<h3>吃的掌故</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>春宴席上的談風，往往「在吃言吃」，談到許多關於吃的掌放。有一位長髯過腹的潘老先生，足跡半中國，熟於吃的掌故。以下一段「饕餐史」，便是他老人家在掀髯笑談的時候講出來的；　　乾隆年間的大經略福康安，他是一個饕餐專家；州縣辦差，辦着他的差，誰都要搖頭的。一天，福大經略路過某縣，他知道這是一個貧瘠的縣，總算格外體貼，不要縣令預備整席的菜餚，只須一色「白切肉」便够了。</p>
<p>白切肉是很普通的菜餚，要不了許多錢，縣令聽得這般的吩咐，如釋重負，待要飭令廚房照辦；卻被大經略的隨從知道了，不用縣令製辦，只須獻上肥猪，自有大經略帶來的廚役，會得如法料理。縣令以爲一次白切肉，至多一頭肥猪便够了；但是，大經略的隨從，指索五十頭肥猪，這是最少限度，缺一不可的。縣令對於欽差大臣的供應，要怎様，便怎様，只得在四處徵求到五十頭肥猪，送上欽差行轅，以備福大經略吃一頓白切肉。</p>
<p>縣令心裏奇怪，吃一頓白切肉，何至要這許多肥猪？待到大經略午餐的候，他便很恭敬的到行轅中去照料。名曰照料，其實要看這五十頭肥猪所製成的白切肉，是怎様一個製法？但見，席上放着許多小碟兒，大抵鹹的辣的酸的甜的都有，這是預備蘸着白切肉吃的。一切布置完畢後，廚役托着兩大盆疊的尺許高的白切肉來上席。這般的白切肉，簡直見所未見，片片圓如市上的應時春餅，圓周是肥肉，其中都是精肉，層層疊疊，周圍毫無參差，不知是怎様製辦的？福大經略飽餐以後，他又帶着隨從到别處去了。</p>
<p>欽差走後，縣令到行轅的廚房左近去參觀，但聽得一片猪呌的慘聲、原來這五十頭肥猪都參在血泊裏掙扎，每頭肥猪，只割去左右四片臀肉，面上的兩片是不用的，用的是第二刀割下的臀肉　所以圓周是肥的，而圓心都是精的。</p>
<p>飽餐一頓的福康安去得遠了，五百頭没屁股的肥猪猶在泊中哀號—</p>
<h3>吳芝瑛軼事</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>吳芝瑛，廉南湖之夫人，茲聞病歾，則女界中前輩，又弱一個，良可哀悼。爰述一二軼事，以諗閱者。夫人，係桐城吳摯甫先生之女姪，其父名寳山，出爲山左某縣邑宰，有循吏之目，頗著政聲。夫人無弟妹，幼時鍾愛，雖巾幗才，而無異男兒視之。及長，嫺經史，尤善書，挺瘦清秀，爲士林所寳，蓋得衛夫人之遺意焉。</p>
<p>無錫廉南湖，當清季在度支部郎中任，夫人與焉，凡京邸顯達者流，無不知夫人之名。西后那拉氏，慕其書，得與余沈壽精繡，同邀賞賚，稱一時競爽。時劉鐵雲家藏一碑文，固世所希睹之法物也，而夫人欲其割愛，爭之累年不獲，卒以成隙，都下傳爲佳話。迨南湖解職旋南，築别業於滬之西郊，顔其所居，曰「萬柳草堂，」垂楊罨畫間，風景絕勝。夫人自號「萬柳夫人，」而與名妓李蘋香相莫逆，以蘋香善吟哦，故往還益密，至不惜解簪珥以爲之脫籍，其尙俠憐才，雖鬚眉有弗及者。當秋瑾斬亭之獄起，夫人奔走尤力，不濟，乃與徐寄塵輩，卒瘞其骸骨於西湖之麓，且樹碑以勒之矣。未幾，爲都察院御史常徽所聞，上封奏劾之，遂削其墓，而夫人賴女敎士麥美德力，始倖免。至辛亥，義聲起鄂中，自是還葬西冷，而滬上執紼者，多至數千人，以麵揑成浙撫張曾歇，紹興府貴福等，爲極大之龜，隨之以行，胥夫人爭之也。</p>
<p>夫人書有楞嚴經一部，極賓貴，自謂「今多肉眼，無識者，五百年後，當相賞於筆毛墨瀋之間，」欲造七汲浮屠以爲奠基之資，卒未果。今夫人畢生之手蹟，不知遺落於何所也。</p>
<h3>轉變</h3>
<p>— 錢醉竹</p>
<p>閕的一聲，門忽然開了。萎靡不振的繼英弟，喜孜孜拿了一封信，在跳進我的房裏。直嚷着：</p>
<p>「麟伯的信來了！麟伯的信來了！」我被他嚇了一跳！對他臉上一看，蹙緊的眉峯裏，露出了一些喜色！憔悴的額尖上，也隠隠露出一絲紅光。</p>
<p>「麟伯的信怎様說？」</p>
<p>我淡淡地問，明知這也不算什麽好消息？</p>
<p>「他在大連等我，一同到寬城子去。盤費不够的話，呌我向天津張國傑去要。」</p>
<p>繼英弟很高興的大聲地告訴我。</p>
<p>「張國俊？不是，頭山俟一二那傢伙嗎？」</p>
<p>大概我的語調是嚴重了一些，使繼英弟有些囁嚅起來：</p>
<p>「是……是啊……正是他，不過……我爲，……」</p>
<p>繼英弟發現了一些窘態。</p>
<p>「無論爲了什麽？我覺得你還没有到賣身投靠的地位……」</p>
<p>我的話没有完，繼英弟怫然了！</p>
<p>「什麽呌賣身投靠？太不給人留面子！」</p>
<p>「是！我的話是直率了一些：但請你原諒我的個性。」</p>
<p>「只顧你的個性，就不顧人的面目，生活，士各有志，再見了。」</p>
<p>繼英在砰的一聲裏，發洩了他憤然的態度而走了</p>
<p>繼英是走了！而我呢，沉入了悲哀的憧憬中，而忍不住要痛哭！</p>
<p>三年前在學生會代表席上的繼英。是怎様一個人？現在又是怎様一個人？誰使他會這様轉變的呢？唉！</p>
<h3>做一行怨一行</h3>
<p>— 江柳聲</p>
<p>讀二日本欄張炳鐸君「文人」一文後，不覺表示了許多同情。在下在二三年前，也未始不是一個終日埋首案牘，手不停揮所謂筆墨生涯的過來中人。後來因爲文人的生活，太凄慘了，太可憐了，就是積勞成疾的死了。簡直也没有人來可惜，送一點撫卹金給你的，有時也許還有人冷譏熱諷，賜你一個「死不足惜」的輓詞。所以我就發憤，抛去秃筆，中途出家，改行走向廣告界裏來了。不知不覺又混了二年多功夫，在經濟精神種種方面，雖較舒暢順利不少，可是有時候，還覺得仰人鼻息，忍氣呑聲的痛苦，諺語，所謂做一行怨一行，確是絲毫不錯。</p>
<p>我人在茶坊酒肆中，隨時可以聽得前項訴怨嘆苦的口吻，如某甲如何道苦，某乙又如何怨命，並且在甲的方面，總以爲做到乙的地位，必定如何舒適，免去痛苦，等到甲果眞做到乙的地位，甲又連聲道苦，一仍其舊了。</p>
<p>唉！喜新厭舊，人之常情，可惜職業的自擇，地位的變遷，不能如願。無怪軍閥政客，偉人名流，要互相傾軋，奪利爭權了。（却酬）</p>
<h3>硯的研究（三）</h3>
<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>（二）實用主義漸趨於文藝化</p>
<p>實用的硯漸趨於文藝化的原因又何在呢？理由那是很簡單的：第一，我國人富有優美高尙的娱樂性，工欲善事，必先利器，本是古人的格言。歷代文學書畫名家所恃爲利器者，文房四實也，四寳中尤推重硯，前人稱筆壽日，墨壽月，硯壽世，用意可知。又云：明窗凈几，筆墨精良，文人樂事，硯當亦包括在内。旣愛其硯，則對於硯的裝飾，遂亦不惜窮思極想，逐項研求，以表現其美，於是硯之大小·式様·雕琢·題跋·以及硯匣的質料欵式等類，亦無一不隨文學藝術的進步而進步，隨時代風尙嗜好的轉移而轉移；故謂硯足以代表時代之文藝，非無稽的。第二，愛硯之風，倡導於帝王宫庭間，文學侍從之人和之，故風行極易。中國文藝，秦漢以後，始漸啓發，其時之硯，甚爲質樸，晋代所行的凹心硯，及稍後出的人面硯鳳池箕形等硯，已覺新奇特别，但製作亦簡單。如王羲之獻之顧愷之等刻硯，見於譜上者甚鮮。迨乎唐初，有太宗高宗等提倡文化於上，而文學家書畫家如虞世南·歐陽洵·褚遂良·吳道子·王維·顔眞卿·等，復先後輩出，於是對於硯的製作式様，逐漸變化改良，旣須妥適合用，復求工細悅目，花様乃以漸多，晚唐始盛行硯側的雕刻，而雕刻法爲之一變。繼唐三百年而起的趙宋，復將文化發揚光大，工詩文繪畫之士多，對於硯的雕刻，益趨於番美一途。硯的式様，據杜綰雲林石譜所載有七十餘種，商似孫硯箋的硯圖說，擇其近雅者有二十四種，如下：</p>
<p>鳳池　玉堂　玉臺蓬萊　辟雍　院様　房相様　郎官様　天硯風字　人面　圭　璧斧　鼎　𨫼�</p>
<p>曲水　八稜　四直　蓮葉　蟾　馬蹄</p>
<p>而據文房肆考上的硯圖，除上述二十四種以外，又有箕様·瓜様·仙桃様·鐘様·卵様·龜様·梭様·琴様·琵琶様·雙魚様·團様·月様·腰鼓様·月池様·等，至風字様則有所謂垂裙風字，平底風字，有脚風字，古様風字，琴足風字，（並說明宣和初御府降様，造形若風字，如鳳池様，但有四環刻海水魚龍三神山水池作崑崙狀，左日右月星斗羅列，以供太上皇書府用，）四直様則有所謂古様四直·雙錦四直·合歡四直·八稜様則有所謂八稜角柄秉硯·八稜秉硯·竹節秉硯·名目更多。唐積之的歙州硯譜所載宋代硯式，亦間有不同，總之此種硯様的變化，大概都倡自宫廷，可以確信的。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十五回</p>
<p>淚臉送人辭家歸遠戌</p>
<p>風沙澈夜出塞駐孤城</p>
<p>士立就在外面笑着呌道；别睡了，堡裏來了客了。裏面那人聽到聲音不熟，連連問着幾聲是誰。大家順了黄土壁子走過去，却見兩扇合攏的稭秫門上，將尺方紅紙塊，寫了兩個喜字貼在上面。這種東西射到自强眼裏，就不由心裏一動。再看看那紅紙，還是鮮艶異常，分明是張貼未久呢。自强看着呆了還不曾說出一個字，那兩扇稭秫門拉開了，出來一個中年漢子，身上穿了一件藍布棉袍，外套青布馬褂，雖然，口外人，不知道梳那藝術化的頭髮，然而後半邊腦袋梳的鴨庇股式，却是漆黑油光，這分明是那位新郎了。他看見四個軍人，早就張口結舌的道：老老……總，打聽打……聽誰？說話時，兩隻眼睛轉着身子只管向後退。自强搖着手道：你不要害怕，我們是來和這裏堡董說話的，請你告訴我他住在那兒？他還不曾答言呢，却有婦人呌道：逃命罷，大……大大兵來了幾萬啦。只這一聲引起了堡裏的狗呌，各個黄土屋子裏，都有人鑽了出來。自强深知這熱河省的人民，飽受過土著匪化軍的騷擾，所以看到兵來了，就嚇破了膽，只得站到村屋中心，亂搖着手，亂嚷别害怕，别害怕。可是他在風沙裏吹過了一宿，臉上讓風沙沾染得黑張飛一般，連鼻子眼睛都分不出來，那身上的灰色制服，半成了黑色，兩隻脚上的黄泥，齊平了腿袴。不必身上有武器，已是個活鬼，何况他帶有手槍，跟隨的人，又各背了步槍，更是可怕。他張開嘴，黑臉上露着白牙齒，大家只見他發急，那聽得出他說些什麽？他越是亂招亂嚷，大家更逃的厲害。（三三七）</p>

<h3>成立紀念演講補誌</h3>
<p>日前中山文化敎育館、舉行成立一週紀念典禮、理事長孫哲生因公在京、特託葉恭綽代表主席、盛况曾誌各報、茲悉當時各理事、講詞微有出入、特補誌如下、</p>
<p>理事李石曾　略謂、本館之工作、在閘揚總理之遺敎、問題甚多、幾不知從何處說起、今僅就關於中山先生主義中、提出兩字或卽本館之主義、卽「互助」是也、互助之義甚普通、在學說上爲互助與競爭、在主義上爲互助與鬥爭、究竟采取競爭歟鬥爭歟、不獨黨外人有疑問、黨内同志亦多懷疑近幾年來之共黨猖獗、亦由誤認斯義總理在遺敎中講之甚簡潔、略謂「國家社會者互助之體也……」全國全黨無論在互助之學說或主義上、應從文化上或敎育上去運用、本館去年奬學以生物爲主、今年將以敎育爲主、正符茲義、</p>
<p>理事孔庸之　略謂總理奮鬥四十年、完全抱犧牲救世主義、其精神可永遠爲後人留紀念者、卽此爲民衆非爲個人之犧牲、爲救中國救世界之心願、革命黨人、最要緊是少說話多做事、如何實行主義、如何灌注於人羣、如何普被於世界、欲達到此目的必須大家努力、今天聚於此者、皆總理之忠實信徒、第一要學總理之犧牲精神救世主義、能先就自已範圍、恭行服膺、再宣傳推進、從中國出發、以達到天下爲公、世界大同之實現、肩此使命、始不愧爲總理忠實信徒、願與親愛同志共勉之、</p>
<p>理事蔡孑民　略謂中山文敎館、爲繼承總理遺志以發揚光大、總理四十年之革命、注重在政治、試觀遺敎亦政治居多、政治非單獨可行、必須以文化爲之推進、民族主義最後章中、講中國文化比歐洲還高、知難行易及實業建設篇中、頗多引證、如中國最先有指南針印刷術及火藥諸種發明是、哲生先生發起文敎館、亦鑒於政治上要辦之事、已有各級政府爲之擔負、爲分工起見、故須有一團體、做文化工作、文化包括太多、應當先其所急、剛才主席報告、年來所辦之事業、已屬不少、能常久繼續進行、如土地調查、詳細研究、以求解决之方法、是則不僅中國之問題、實爲世界上之一大問題、對於敎育多赴各地考察、有應改良、有應促進、有待實騐、提出方案、則對於國家之供獻必多、奬學金助學金、帮助清苦力學之士、能造成幾個發明家則甚好、至於圖書自東方圖書館遭刦後、迄未能恢復、本館能擴充成立一大圖書館、亦爲時代之所需要、時事類編、期刊索引、其價値卽在繼續不斷、故望現已舉辦者繼續努力、年限長久、很有可觀、但凡屬一種事業、不會自已滿足、本館如有機會能推廣辦他事個人意見以爲須注意文化兄、尤其美術史、文化範圍甚廣、中國可誇口者、爲三大發明、但進步不及人、人之恭維我者、（一）哲學、（二）文學、（三）美術、中國文化尚無完備之史、哲學史文學史現已有人從事可望成功、惟美術史甚少有人努力、因材料陳列、私人頗不易辦、故須賴公家之力、甚望本館繼續已辦之事業、更以餘力致此工作云、</p>

<h3>對於國際無綫電臺應有之認識（上）</h3>
<p>— 陳天佐</p>
<p>我國國際電信交通事業，五十餘年以來，向由外商水綫公司經營，主權旁落，利權外溢，歷年損失，奚止僅萬！洎乎近歲，無綫電事業勃興，我國民政府爲維護主權，挽回漏巵計，於是有國際無綫電台之創立。其創立經過，及内部概况，本刊第四期已有記載，無待贅述。惟是我國國際電信交通，因向受外人操縱把持之故，一般商民，所發電報，交水綫傳遞，已成習慣，對於新興之國營國際無綫電台，反無深切之認識，斯於國家前途，關係至鉅，用草斯篇，以告國人。</p>
<p>夫獨立自主之國家對於一國之電信主權，必保持其完整。良以電信之於國家。猶脈絡之於人身，息息相關，不客受侵蝕，而國際電信爲國家之耳目所寄，於一國之經濟，外交軍事，所關更鉅，尤爲在所必爭。我國際電台卽在此種情勢下所誕生，冀以彌彌缺憾，而完成收回水綫電權之使命者也。</p>
<p>今請述國際電台與我國經濟外交軍事之關係，俾利害觀念，深印於國人之腦海中，時時刻刻不忘該台之重要性，而竭力輔助其發展也。</p>
<h3>先言經濟</h3>
<p>一國之國際電信交通旣受人宰割，則其報費支配之權，全操諸人，自無待言。各水綫公司在華收發電報所得報費，我國除僅分潤其極微之餘瀝外，大部分歸公司所得，此項漏巵，年約八百萬元，五十餘年來，殆四萬萬元，此尙係有形者也；至利用此項電信設備，以操縱我匣際市塲，此其損失，正不知數十百倍於斯也。我國際電台歷來與各國商訂報費攤分數目，一本互惠平等之精神，支配甚爲公允，茲將水綫及無綫電經轉電報報費攤分比較，列表如后，以供參考：</p>
<h3>國際電報報費攤分比較表</h3>
<p>試觀上我表國應得之報費無綫電與水綫比較，多寡懸殊，至爲明顯。今國際電台業已成立，各國拍發國際電報，大抵已捨彼而就此，此每年數百萬元之漏巵，得以從此稍塞。此國際電台關係我國家之經濟者也。</p>
<h3>電碼新編中之新字</h3>

<h3>官軍電報</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>急如救火</p>
<p>上期本刊，記者曾舉電報之傳遞，與道路之行車，互爲比較，覺其情形，深多相似之點；至擬官軍急電救火之車，蓋按照萬國電報通例，官電列於一等，官電而加急（其實官電並無所謂加急，祇有我國官電恒於電文前見此種字様），自更不能不提前拍送也。</p>
<p>官軍急電，直接影響於政治或軍事者甚巨，間接亦關係國内治安民衆生命者綦，經電報之提前拍送，能弭亂於無形，得指揮之順利，則急其所當急，與救火車之通行，人視爲生命財産所係，不可須叟緩，讓着先鞭，任其風馳電掣而去，可謂情有相同，理亦一致；惟從前軍閥秉政時代，私意以爲可使電報，格外迅速（實際上電報照章拍送，並無稽延），於是不論性質是否重要，電文是否關乎公務，多於電前，加以「急」字，嗣後突飛猛進，累𢴣而用「火急」「飛火急」「十萬以至百萬火急」種種字様，因此有報皆飛，無電不急，苟擬諸救火車而試爲推想，恍同要道之上，救火車東來西往，横衝直摬，尋常車輛，有行不得也之苦。救火車觸目皆是，則街道混亂，官軍電而盡爲飛火急，亦豈是好現象耶？</p>
<p>茲再以車爲喻，則救火車祇適用以救火，而不應藉以載客，同様官軍電亦祇宜關乎公務，而不應涉及私事，故官電其名，而私事其實，正與救火車之不救火而私自載客無異。現在政軍當局非比從前，一經交部取締官軍私事電報辦法之實行，當更能酌情明理，俾電路有澄清之望也。</p>
<h3>電話綫路之成分</h3>
<p>— 汪啓堃</p>
<p>電話綫路之成分，不論爲市内或長途，在質上有鐵綫與銅綫之别，在量上則有單綫與雙之别。</p>
<p>鐵綫價廉而質堅，較爲經濟；然其電氣抵抗較高，且有集膚作用（SkinEffect），不宜於通話電流。銅綫適與之相反，故除特殊情形外，電話綫路例用銅綫，其在長途電話則因距離旣遠，通話電流之傳導尤關重要，故亦以採用銅線爲原則。</p>
<p>電話如用單線而以大地爲歸路，創辦費幾可减省一半。惟大地通信，常發生地電流EarthCurrent），足以影響通話。又電車，電力，電燈等項每有以回線之一端接至大地，其所洩漏之電流，每潛入電話缐，4擾亂通話。因之，普通城市内電話缐路宜用雙缐式，長途電話之經過數城市者尤不宜用單線。</p>
<p>長途電話之採用雙缐者，尙有下列諸利益：（一）可採用雙信式（電話電報同時通信），庶可兼辦電報之收發，或使電話線得一補助線。所謂用作補助線，卽亦可使兩能話務員接洽時改用電報，以增高電話缐之效率。（二）可改成幻象電路，卽二對線可作三對用，四對線可作六對用——甚至可用作七對電話缐及一對電報缐；斯出路旣寬，傳遞自可加速。（三）可採用搬送式（CarrierSystem），</p>
<p>使一對線用作四對至十六對，以增加利用電話線之程度。</p>
<p>苟考國内各處之長途電話，軍用者大都採用單線式鐵缐，省辦與商辦者雖有雙綫式銅缐，但亦多用單綫與鐵缐者。交通部所辦者——如京滬，滬杭，平津，青濟（青島至濟南）——皆係雙線式銅缐，京滬更採用雙信式與幻象電路，而成爲有綫與無綫電報之良友。</p>
<p>依據各處長途電話綫路之成分，不難推知其服務成績。抑有進者，電氣通信事業須合於下列諸條件，始得充分顯其效能：卽（一）迅速，（二）正確，（三）穏妥可靠，（四）價廉，（五）手續簡便，（六）可供應鉅量的需要，（七）保持秘密。電氣通信事業中能完全滿足此七項條件者，惟有設備完善之長途電話而已。</p>
<h3>過去一年中有綫電報綫路之施設（中）</h3>
<p>— 錢家廣</p>
<p>已擴育之線路</p>
<p>（一）概况　已成綫路，固應修整；發展交通，尤應擴充。以我國之地大物博，通信設備，决不能長此自限，故交通部於計盡修理幹支線，同時爲民衆着想，俾綫路隨需要而擴充，通信範圍，亦得隨建設而進展。大抵二十二年間，所增之綫路，可約分兩項，加以說明。</p>
<p>（甲）屬於剿匪區域—地方淪爲匪區，從前建設，破壞無餘。中央軍隊，隨時進剿，收復各地，亟應通報，庶休養生聚，消息利於互傳，而軍隊往來，指揮亦多便利。</p>
<p>（乙）屬於商務需要！僻處内地城市，商務發達，而報局尙未設立，與各通商大埠，往返電信，輒須奔走若千里，送至隣近之局拍發，或由隣近局，專差送達，旣不便利，而時間上亦備受遲滯。或者原設綫路，以報務繁忙，不敷支配。爲供給民衆需要起見，實有展設綫　，或增加原有綫條之必要。</p>
<p>（二）統計　依照上述情形，則綫路之擴充，應分爲「增設之綫路」及「增掛之綫條」兩項。所謂「增掛之綫條」，卽就原有之路，按杳添掛電綫，俾實際通信上得以增加效能也。總合以上二種擴充，過去之一年，計成三千一百九十七公里。尙有增設水綫一處，自皖省大通展放至和悅洲，長度爲二千呎。條分縷析，斯可以下列覘之。</p>
<p>（甲）增設之綫路—總數爲二千一百零四公里圻水至英山　　　七十八公里黄安至河口鎭　　二十五公里天津至鹹水沽　　三十三公里鹹水沽至葛沽　　十二公里大冶縣城至下陸　十四公里天津至良王莊　　五十二公里夾浦至董塘　　　十公里獨山至六塞塘　　一百零四公里興安至灌陽　　　一百十五公里天津至大沽　　　一百四十二公里樊城至棗陽　　　八十六公里道口至大名　　　一百二十四公里晏城至管家管　　六十公里富州至鎭邊　　　六十三公里洛陽至孟縣　　　七十三公里武穴至黄梅　　　六十九公里江干至富陽　　　三十四公里平遠至尋鄔　　　一百二十一公里峽江至吉氷　　　六十九公里峽流河至吉縣　　十二公里龍渠至遂昌　　　六十九公里光州至商城　　　五十五公里永豐至安樂　　　五十八公里安樂至崇仁　　　八十一公里水口至古田　　　六十九公里撫州至崇仁　　　五十二公里撫州至宜黄　　　七十五公里牛口至巫山　　　八十一公里撫州至金谿　　　五十八公里浦城經龍泉至慶元　二百十公里　　（乙）增掛之綫條—總數爲一千零九十三公里無錫至江陰　　　四十公里巫山至夔州　　　六十九公里湖州至夾浦　　　五十九公里合磯港至大冶　　七十一公里蔡甸至沙市　　　二百七十六公里北平至玉田　　　一百十九公里北平至湯山　　　三十五公里北平至張家口　　二百四十三公里杭州至長安　　　五十二公里德州至晏城　　　八十九公里</p>
<h3>談談上海發寄電報的便利</h3>
<p>— 季清</p>
<p>局台及收發分處</p>
<p>共有十九處之多</p>
<p>現在我們要拍發一張電報，實在覺得便當極了。因爲各地電報局或無綫電台，除在本局台收發處接收電報以外，爲便利距離較遠的發報民衆起見，多在繁鬧適中地點，添設收發分處，或收報處，接收各種電報。那末發報的人們，有電報拍發時，不必一定要到電報局，或無綫電台，他們就近在收發分處，或收報處發寄，亦是一様的可以迅捷到達全世界或全國各處。</p>
<p>我們住在上海，要發寄電報，尤覺比别處格外便當。因爲國際電台，電報局，無綫電台，各局台收發分處，和附設在上海銀行及各分行内的各收報處，以及各水綫收發處大大小小，數近二十所之多。星羅棋佈，到處皆是，大有五步一局，隔街一台轉灣一收發分處，過街一收報處的情景。因此我們發寄電報，眞是萬分的便利了！</p>
<p>現在要使大家知道各局台，各收發分處，和各收報處所在的地點起見，我反牠們一一開列（見本刊上方），以便大家隨時查閱。</p>
<p>各電報局，無綫電台，收發分處，和收報處，都是隸屬交通部的。所有辦事人員，均奉有嚴厲的部令，辦事要商業化，措施要民衆化，舉動要禮貎化。倘使他們擺出衙門大爺的架子，辦事因循敷衍，和對收發報人不守禮貎，那末請大家不客氣的報告主管人員，一定要嚴厲查辦，和竭力改善。</p>
<h3>海外無綫電近况</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>英法航空短波通信</p>
<p>英法兩國航空部，爲維持民用航空安全起見，特於英吉利海峽兩岸之林潑南及安葛勒凡爾航空站間，設置超短波無綫電收發報機，聯絡通信。兩站距離，約三十五哩。所用波長約七吋。雙方試騐結果，甚爲圓滿。蓋此項超短波通信，不特可避免空氣中之種種干擾，且能擔保通信之秘密與穏妥。聞該路通信已於本年一月二十六日正式開放。目前業務，祗限於收發報告飛機出發及到達時刻之電報云。</p>
<h3>麥開公司新設電台</h3>
<p>美國麥開無綫電報公司，新設之支加哥，紐阿利恩斯及西阿圖電台，於上年十二月間開放通報。合之原有紐約，舊金山，洛斯安其爾，浦脫倫四台，共計已有國内電台七處。該公司與郵電公司，同爲國際報話公司之聯合公司，雙方業務，向取合作辦法。故郵電公司之發報主顧，如有發寄上述七處之電報，概可交麥開公司電台傳遞。按麥開公司經營國内無綫電業務，係於一九一一年開始。當時於太平洋沿岸各重要城市，設立電台，收發商報。迨至一九一四年，始開辦美國與檀香山羣島間之海洋通信。現有國際無綫電路，可直達丹麥，匈牙利，奥國，凡諦岡，西班牙，阿根庭，可倫比亞，秘魯，古巴，檀香山，菲列濱及中國各處。</p>

<p>瑞典最大廣播電台之設立</p>
<p>瑞典電報局請求政府於建設費内，撥用一百四十萬開羅，（一開羅等於美金○·二六七元）爲重建Motala廣播電台之用，該臺現有電力爲三十瓩，將來可增至一百五十瓩，爲瑞典最大之電臺云。（倫敦電氣評論）</p>
<p>匈牙利最高天綫之電臺</p>
<p>匈京一百二十瓩之新電臺，業已開放。其雪茄式電桅，達三百十四米達之高，爲世界最高之天綫。各種機件，均係雙料，（雖水晶振動器亦然）以備急需。該臺最下一層，有四個一百二十瓩之電門，作爲推拽之用。又有一種奇異之電紐，遇繁急時，此紐在一秒鐘内，可將全部電源斷阻去。（　倫敦電氣評論）</p>
<p>瑞士電話幹綫之裝設</p>
<p>瑞士政府近在Valais地方，從事重建停頓經年之電話幹綫。此綫沿勒蒙湖畔越羅尼平原而達布里克，共長約九十七英里。將與新着倫遂道之電話，水綫相接，再由意大利方面之電鑰，接至Iselle地方與意屬電話綫相接，於是日内瓦與米蘭間之地下電纜，可以完成通話。（倫敦電氣評論）</p>
<p>馬來聯邦南北話綫之接通</p>
<p>英屬馬來聯邦與新加坡及馬來北境之直達電話綫，將於十一月一日成立，届時現有之聯邦幹綫，將擴充至馬來北境非聯邦所屬之開得與北里兩地，於是此半島之南北兩部，將有通話可能矣。（美國駐新商務專員報告）</p>
<p>德國自動電話之進展</p>
<p>據郵政總局宣稱：自動電話式交換所現在柏林安設者僅十一所，此種新式電話已於一九二六年開工，將於一九三五年完成，計劃在柏林城内，有八十個交換所，該城現有電話用户約共二十六萬號云。（美國柏林商務專員報告）</p>
<p>日本電綫製造廠之成績</p>
<p>日本Sumitomo電綫製造廠，前奉遞信省之命，於前年二月，在大阪之西南區，Shirinashi（該處可停舶萬噸户輪）設立製造水綫工廠一所，該廠地址，共有三千六百坪（約三英畝）之廣，其中一千四百坪（約一畝）爲工塲事務室及其附屬房屋。其機械能製造各種絕緣水綫。此爲日本唯一製造水綫之工廠，日本此時對於此項水綫，能獨立製造而無須仰給外人矣。該廠初次出品，爲台灣地方政府接通七海里之海底電纜，後爲日本政府安設東京灣電話水綫數條，及朝鮮海峽五十七海里之電話水綫，現正承造定貨水綫多種，其長度約數百海里云云。（遠東評論）</p>
<h3>半月消息</h3>
<p>— 社友</p>
<p>郵匯局電匯電報收費辦法</p>
<p>交部前爲便利民衆通訊及節省經費起見，曾今飭郵電兩方主管機關會商合作辦法，除關於郵電兩局合設，及郵轉電報免收郵資各節，已誌上期本刊外，尙有郵匯局所發電匯電報收費辦法一種，亦經議定自三月十五日起實行。茲將該辦法擇要探誌於後：</p>
<p>一·郵政儲金匯業總分局，及兼辦儲匯業務之郵局所發電匯電報，不論電文華洋明密，每通在二十字以内者，一律收費銀元陸角，逾限每字加收銀元五分。</p>
<p>二·此項電匯電報如須列作加急電報遞寄者，應照上開價目加倍收費。如須校對者，加半收費。</p>
<p>三·此項電匯電報應以MDT爲標識，書於收報人姓名住址及地名之前，作一字計費。</p>
<p>上項電匯電報收費辦法，祇限郵匯局所發者適用。其他銀行所發電匯電報，仍照普通價目收費。聞交部對於郵匯局所發電匯電報，特予减價收費者，一因郵局方面自三月十五日起，對於郵轉電報之郵資一律免收。二因郵匯局所收各項匯欵，大多均不及百元，爲便利民衆起見，特將電匯電報减價收費，俾一般民衆在急需匯欵時，可費數角之電費，卽可迅速匯到云。</p>

<p>金市昨逢掉期、以致市况較堅、一天間形勢平穏而多盤、晨初以海外英美俱平、五金交易所遠期銀價軋過微縮、滙兌雖升而微、倫敦生金跌一便士半、美棉近升遠降、爲數不多、美麥縮一二五、毛盤開出平穏、開後初以銀行扒遠而塞近、匯市平平而靜、迨後内盤略見緊臻、一度穿出五十元外滙豐銀行掛牌英美亦無伸縮、銀行仍在供給、依然回降、但形勢盤旋、差度極微、午前市况平庸、買賣平衡、蓋後市卽將掉期也、後市以午刻外電西雅圖夜市期銀下降六十餘磅音、掉期預做空方加至貼出八元光景、而穿出五十元大關外、開後滙市平庸、依然退入五十元關内、迨後掉期跌價下跌、人心恍惚、大户猛來售條而更挫、一天趨勢平庸、赤金價計九六一元半、本届掉期塲内開盤爲買方貼進七元、今將一天市况誌後、</p>
<p>晨開爲九四七元七角、較前收升七角、物品開同價、滙市開出近期賣價英滙一先令四便士五六二五、英滙三十五元一八七五、上塲時滙市因銀行扒遠塞近、形勢平靜、迨後麥加利扒六月份美金六二五、大昌祥恒興恒餘生大義大永等紛紛買進、而漲到五十元零二角預悉匯豐掛牌未動、宏利物品售條、麥加利出來四月份美金二五、退爲九元、此際因天豐恒昌永等咸進、尙有掙扎、無如德康努力撳小、元春義豐永亦賣、銀行曾塞七月份美金六八七五、而跌至八元半、入後恒興努力買進、宏利雖售、然大興永等亦有購買不久、又漲爲九元九角、華比塞出五月份美金三七五、四月份二五、三井住友交通等又塞六月份半元、志豐永茂永元賣出、退爲九元、盈豐恒等略進、安達雖塞六月份美金五六二五、但華比麥加利則扒七月份美金六八七五、形勢仍稳徘徊之下、午收爲九四九元三角、物品拍九元二角、收市後略穏</p>
<p>後市開盤九五零元四角、物品開九元四角三井大通俱塞六月份美金半元、物品撳小、志豐永正昌天豐福餘等賣、乃自零五角跌至四十九元二角、恒昌永元亨義豐永等趁低尙進升爲九元七角入後掉期做小、大户如大德成元茂永等力售不已、大興永雖進、然因萬興亦售、形勢步跌、降爲八元二角、收盤爲九四八元三角物品拍八元七角、收市後初平後疲、大德成生大等略售、缺乏買户、最後退至八元内、查一天間最高價七五零元五角、最低價九四七元七角、有二元八角上落、結果較前收升一元三角、</p>
<p>結價因匯豐銀行美匯掛牌未動、仍計三十四元七五、合標金價九九五元餘、照收盤價言約撳四十七元、較前收少撳一元、三月期結價因先令掛牌未更、由匯兌合標金價七零五元餘、照收盤價言約撳二元、較前少撳二元餘、本月份登賬七零二元、四月份九四九元、上午補水七零二元、下午七零三元、赤金價計九六一元半、塲内交易仍清、盈豐恒進天津貨三百餘兩、照加十元零七角半、此外大豐恒曾售予銀樓九九三成色七十兩、照加十三元、後市天津帮售予盈豐恒一百二十兩、爲九六零元六角、約照加十一元光景、中央胃口仍滯、大致照期標價格或有成交、</p>
<p>場丙交易平平　综計萬興順利大德成元茂永福餘元春丙興永德同春鼎昌德康等居於賣方、恒秦鴻興順茂恒昌永乾昌祥大昌祥大興永元豐永大發永昌升永等居於買方、大德成元茂氷失進後出義豐永恒餘志豐永先出後進、大連帮萬興共做一千四百光景、軋出一千一百餘條、順利共做六百餘條、軋出一百餘條、廣帮生大進出各一百餘條、恒興進二百餘、出一百餘條、後市均靜、</p>
<p>三月期里開後寂無動靜延之頗久迨後成康售予正昌九十一條、爲一元半、晨開遂爲七零一元半、較之前收升起七角、最後義大永來進、由祥豐賣出四十二條、升至二元、午收爲七零二元、後市仍乏對手、掙扎之餘、僅由祥豐售予乾昌祥六十三條、爲三元、開盤爲七零三元此價天豐亦有賣胃但以後卽乏對做、是以延至收盤、仍七零三元、查一天間最高七零三元、最低七零一元半、計一元半相差、結果較之前收升起二元二角、</p>
<p>掉期（四月掉五月）於後市一時半前卽行開始預做、初喊多頭貼進六元半七元、此際交易不多、萬興乾昌祥等雖有掉出、無如空頭極殷、立卽加爲七元三四角、是際成交較旺、大户如大豐恒鴻興福餘貼進、志豐永宏利義豐永等紛紛貼出、迨夫恒餘志豐永義豐永鼎昌惠祥元茂永大成福餘生大瑞興乾昌祥恒泰等陸續貼出、貼價步昂、升爲八元、大連帮及丙興乃來掉出、入後大連帮匯源乾昌祥永德慶發永前來貼進、乃退爲七元六七角、但以元茂永恒餘正昌義大永天豐永等仍有貼出、尙有掙扎、入後乾昌祥猛力將多頭放出、盈豐恒春源永元茂永恊康慶發永貼進不息、正式開盤爲買方貼進七元、開後大德成萃泰天豐貼出、元茂永春源永慶發永義大永貼進、盤旋於七元内、入後元茂永猛來掉出、恒餘同豐恒大昌祥亦來貼進而賤、志豐永雖一再貼出、（内有他號條子）無如恒興源元茂永貼進殊勇、收盤遂退爲六元二角、收市後盈豐恒義大永潤昌裕義昌萬興等再來貼進、遂更降至六元内、大户尙未掉妥、剩餘無幾焉、</p>

<h3>本市紗廠六月一日起减工</h3>
<p>—標紗晨市續漲後市稍回—</p>
<p>紗市晨間漲風頗勁、因上日廠方會議、結果圓滿、自六月一日起一律减工、於是散空發現惶恐之狀、急於購進抵補、因此漲風愈趨激昂、惟午後商塲上發生流言、謂英商怡和廠有開出二十支五福牧关紗三四千件但價格及接受者尙未宣佈、市盤略受影響而萎、</p>

<h3>十分冷寂之標花市</h3>
<p>棉市平疲、暗滲無神、一片荒凉之狀、而海外棉市極其軟化、印棉以存底增厚、市價愈疲、本埠棉市應有下落可能、無如紗市趨漲、棉市被其帶挺、廠方减工之風說極盛、棉市前途、較紗市爲弱、</p>

<h3>期粉市奄無氣</h3>
<p>—抛户不多結局尙平—</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初定繼疲之態、洋麥報價、芝加哥小四八分不等、坎拿大小二角零、當開盤時、因市塲浮多心思仍佳、各月份開價、較前日好半分一分不等、後以實銷帮一無動靜、小廠略有應酬抛售、致市氣又復轉平、迨至下午開盤、各月份市面、大致盤旋、惟以抛户不暢、結局又稍稍回起、不過各盤交易、則仍冷寂不堪也、考近來市面、生氣寂然、其總原因仍屬各地經濟枯燥、購買無力、人爲之支配、故不能見效也、結果本月份較小二厘半、四月份徵好五厘、五六月份不動、七八月份好五厘、</p>
<h3>遠期麥買賣兩寂</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、仍見冷寂不堪之象、洋麥報價、雖仍小小四八分至二角零不等、惟標凖局面、終少顯著之出入、本月份市面、因有洋麥之套入、人心已經軟化、處此粉銷不振之中、雖軋空成功、猶無實益、况有洋麥者、正可趁勢出其後也、遠期因國麥年景、尙少把握、買賣遂均兩寂、結舉祗本月份較小二分、餘均無比較、現麥以廠胃已停、故無做開云、</p>
<h3>晚稻銷動續提五分</h3>

<p>（滬北）昨河下各貨來源四十七八號、市上各種銷路略動、市形白粳早市平疲、午市定局、早薄稻價形修削數分、羊杜埠客尖變陰元無甚上落、</p>
<h3>客秈暢銷續漲</h3>
<p>—洋米貶價求脫—</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、形勢極佳、因邇日産價步漲、來源逐减、湘省當局收買儲存倉庫糙米五十萬包、已經實行、近日正在開始收買、故此後湘省糙米之成本當逐有加昻、此間行販昨日立卽喊高二角、然市上存底尙足、且有他省到貨、行情亦未能扳足、故結果續漲一角二三分及六七分不等、其他機糙各米一律跟好、在上午市價、初次喊高時、本客去化尙淡、及午後貨主稍爲拉低、始有閩浙兩省各帮問津、閩省福州泉州兩帮、浙省寗波温州兩路、胃口較貪、本街内地亦有去路、昨以甬帮較貪、辦去有四千多包、此後各路去胃尙濃、惟漲太速、恐亦不劃搬運耳、全日開去各路機糙秈九千八百三十二包、小絞洋米開一千包、暗盤二千五百包、初價六元七角、繼爲六元六角七分、最低六元六角半、寗波去一千包其餘均由本街收進、此價又比前開見跌、因貨主意在貶價以求去路、</p>

<p>昨黄荳市况先軟而後緊、廠家辦胃晨斷午續、形勢尙少向榮之象、良以吃價有限、且取小價之貨、所以一時難以發展、昨計廠家辦去河南歸德碭山　荳約有七千餘包、市價高次扯售二元五角、江北油坊採取臨淮關荳三車、價扯二元三角三、餘外本街出口等辦去車輪各豆、約有四五車云、</p>

<h3>糖市海南赤砂開出千餘包</h3>
<p>—後市仍難看好—</p>
<p>昨糖市以去化清淡、公會劃盤均少做出、惟海南赤砂因烟臺帮動辦、開出千餘包、價爲十三元三四角、比前降一二角、身潮者雖喊價十三元、亦乏對手、照茲存底擁擠、後勢仍難振作、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢羢川銷不動</h3>
<p>毛貨呢絨當令暢銷、同業號家逐日開出之數、有增無减、標凖市氣穏固、借川帮遲不動辦、未免美中不足耳、實由銀根不鬆、又郵包稅費將增等所致、邇來該帮進胃些微、大半莊家均須接上峯函件、方能稍事點綴、均無自主採配力量、據該帮熟客預測、旬日後或有羣起動辦訊、但春銷之薄呢等、大半已多不及趕辦矣、</p>

<h3>人頭祭靈</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>西洋人對於死者，縱是仇敵，也總表示着相當的敬意。因此，人與人之間，如遇有不解的寃讐，只要能將敵人打倒，便不再計較，很少見以死人來復讐的事。而且他們報讐的對向，只是「以牙還牙」就够了，絕不會牽連到許多無辜的人。</p>
<p>而在中國事情就大大的不同了：對於敵人，縱是死掉的，也還是不能容赦；伍子胥鞭打死屍，成爲復讐的千古的美談。這雖是比較稀有的事，但我們在普通的書上是很容易打到與此相似的例的；剪草除根，殺得敵家的雞犬不留而後已。春秋時代屠趙兩家之爭，只因失掉一個不滿週歲的嬰兒，甚至要把滿城同様大的婴兒盡都殺掉，以絕後患。並且通常把敵人千刀萬剮之後，還不够出氣，還要把血淋淋的人頭，祭在多年死者的靈前，才算快事。</p>
<p>同時中國人對於敵人的態度也和西洋人不同。我們讀北歐的小說，時常看到有復讐的故事，不過他們雖恨敵人，却也尊敬敵人，對方越是强者，也越尊敬他，反敵人致死之際，他們彼此反到像是發生了友誼的理解了，絕不會再有毁壞敵人的屍首解恨的事。因爲尊敬敵人，所以他們報讐的手段，總是光明正大的，處在互相鬥爭的地位。這在中國，則恰恰相反，倘如敵人是强者，寃仇也許暫時就不要報了，甚至對他逢迎阿諛，成了敵入的走狗了；但敵人如是弱者，那便會想盡了卑鄙污濁的手段，做到斬盡殺絕的地步而後止。</p>
<p>像中國人這種報讐的態度，正是表現出中國民族的兩種特殊的氣質，一方面表示了可恥的懦弱，一方面表示了非人性的殘忍。而且從這懦弱加殘忍的中國民族的特殊的氣質裏，我們更可以理解爲什麽中國人打落水狗的精神特别發達。</p>
<h3>暮光紹呂</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>料峭的黄昏，抺上冷僻的山徑；一頂肩輿，忽忽的穿過古老的茶亭。縷縷的青烟，浮繞峭峻的山峯，幾點烏鴉，翩翩的飛入幽綠的松林。老邁的樵夫，背負著兩束乾薪，喘着氣息，慢慢的踱進破舊的籬門！</p>
<h3>孔廟散步</h3>
<p>— 自戈</p>
<p>有　一個期間，就是在兩年以前的那一個年頭，我差不多每天總要在孔廟中散步一次。所謂每天一次，當然是說的平均數，其實有時是一天就去幾次，有時是幾天不去一次的。</p>
<p>那時候，我就住在孔廟底隔壁，中間有條巷子就是闕里。白天，除了打發自已應做的事情以外，還要拿一部分精力打量那些和我一道吃飯做事的人們底臉色。晚間，自已底屋子總是被一　和我一様大的年紀或甚至比我還大的青年包圍得氣息不通，而要想逃脫又無處可走。所以，我只能利用早上或黄昏的時候偷偷地跑到孔廟中去散步，使自已得着深深地呼吸幾口清靜的空氣的機會。　　要到孔廟中去，只能從兩邊的側門走入。爲了路道的順便，我們每次總是從闕里道邊挨着孔府的側門進去。一走進門，就見着許多像烏龜那様的東西躺在地下，背上背着高到一丈以上的大碑。全體都是由很堅緻的石頭彫成的，但看起來却不能不令人發生一點可憐的感覺。所以一般同事往往一走到這裏就指着它們打趣别人說：「你是多麽可憐啊！」同時，我亦從此知道了那里的青年們駡人遲緩動輒愛說「你被大碑壓着了呀！」這句話的意味。　　向右上去，穿過一道大門，就可以抬頭見着大成殿。走下石階，横在面前的，却是相傳爲孔子設敎所在的杏壇。就在石階下底左邊，正是杏壇前面底對面，有一道上鐫着「先師乎植檜」五字的長碑，近旁矗立着一株檜樹，側邊用玻璃框着一節枯朽的樹頭，據說那才是孔子親乎植的檜樹，活着的一株是由它派生出來的。杏壇是一個四角形的亭子，前面有幾株小小的杏樹，只有傾斜着的一株算是老的，我見着它們開花結果，我曾摘過那杏子來吃，味道并不甜美，想來是新植不久的吧。杏壇中間，掛得有一個像鐘鈴那一類的東西，據說就是木鐸，敲起來到還好聽，但不能不使人懷疑這是由「天將以夫子爲木鐸」一句話産生出來的附會物。一直走上，就到了大成殿底當門。（未完）</p>
<h3>冷水文學</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>當人們興高采烈熱中於某事某人某物之際，忽有他人作悟徹語以掃其興者，在我們家鄉，這呌做「攙冷水」。在百度的滾湯中，攙入一桶冷水卽可止沸，甚至使得熱氣全無。熱心的青年，不怕猛惡的勁敵，不怕層累的挫折，最怕的是似出善意的一杓冷水，使你對於自已的信仰努力忽生疑惑，動搖不定，往往至於意冷心灰。且攙冷水者之用意與以醍　灌人者不同，後者在乎輸入智慧令人舒適，是積極的，後者唯在消極地摧毁人們的意志，故也可以說是殺人不見血的軟刀子。</p>
<p>中國人的意志消磨最速，少年容易老成，青春之火，燃燒極暫，原因就在於中國的冷水太多，不說别的，只說古今的文學，多半含有攙冷水的作用。這種冷水文學有一個公式，便是紅樓夢中跛足道人對甄士隠所唱的「好了歌」。茲舉其一首於下：</p>
<p>「世人都曉神仙好，惟有功名忘不了。古今將相在何方？荒塜一堆草没了合乎這公式的例子，最簡單的如李白的這一首詩：</p>
<p>「越王勾踐破吳歸，壯士還家盡錦衣，宫女如花滿春殿—至今惟見鷓鴣飛」這類的作品在古今的詩文集中找不完，而且都是其中的上品。近人編「盪氣迴腸曲一，搜羅古今人之作，僅得薄薄的一本，但若編起冷水文學集來，那就多至可以「等身」了。</p>
<p>古來中國的文學，大概可分爲兩派一派是載儒家之道的廊廟文學，這一派是得志的士大夫所爲，談的是積極的道理，但多陳腐不堪甚至不配稱爲文學。另一派可以說是純文學的，則多出於不遇者之手，受的是道家或釋家的影響，因爲道家或釋家都是主張超脫現世的，所以這派文學也以現世的一切皆空的思想爲共中心。</p>
<p>但是，道家和釋家，雖皆看破現世，而或主返於自然，或主往生凈土，在另一方面、仍有其積極的信仰。跛足道人之「好了歌」，究竟以神仙爲好，以「了」爲歸宿，所以還未墮入虚無主義，故不全是冷水文學。至於澈底到連神仙也否定，凈土也不信的，那纔眞正的冷水文學了，然而其中　在存在着矛盾。旣無所信，又不能了的人是苦悶的，但這苦悶不是不可以排遣，排遣之法，是一面詛咒現世，而一面仍藉現世的一切麻醉自已的靈魂，舉杯消愁，糊塗以終：故曰人生難得是糊塗。</p>
<p>今之幽默文學。其一部分也是冷水文學。以超脫派自居，冷眼觀世，嘲笑一切，不但笑孳孳爲利的人，同時也笑孶孳爲義的人，不但笑他人之所哭，同時也笑他人之所笑。事無大小，人無賢愚，一概以冷水潑之自以爲得，這是現今許多幽默家的態度。林語堂先生提倡幽默以温柔敦厚之詩敎爲勸，而我們多數的幽默家之間最流行的態度，則如PettRidge所云、乃是「與其跟着一一個故事中的主人公一同笑，不如嘲笑他之爲愈」。相差蓋不可以道里計矣。</p>
<p>對於這些廟笑一切的幽默家，倘一追究他們自已的積極的信仰是什麽，恐怕也不免於糊塗。英　幽默雜誌Punch嘗載一幽默故事云：「兩個英國人在巴黎，有一次經，過一家店舖；見門口寫着EnglishSpoken的字様，他們就進去購物，但見那女店員不說一句英語。於是他們之中的一個用不正確的法語問道：誰是說英國語的呀？女店員答道：那是英國籍的顧客們」。</p>
<p>這是幽默文學中的糊塗類的一個好例子。</p>
<h3>看了西湖藝專四展以後</h3>
<p>— 張天翼</p>
<p>屬不西湖藝專第四届展覧會之後，非常想說幾句話，雖然各報上已有很多人發表了些批評文字。我不是凑熱鬧。祗是參觀了這次藝展，不覺鬆了一口氣，因此有所感觸的就忍不住要抒寫出來。</p>
<p>我認爲，當今所謂後期印象派的「藝徒遍海内外」之際，西湖藝專開了這次展覽會，眞是非常有興味，有意義的事。</p>
<p>去年我們曾看見了屬於後期印象派的一個個人畫展。我們祇看見他没命地塗了些顔料，此外一無所得。這也難怪，這是派數如此，祗要顔料刷得起勁就行，輪廓可管不着。但西湖藝專的繪畫却在線條上表現得非常有力。線條這玩意原很麻煩，因此那已到了晚境的一種繪畫藝術，祗好到顔料裏享　　　　面人則有力的　條　象徴着正在興起中的藝術。這次的藝展，作風縱各有不同，而在這一點，步調是一致的。　　所謂到顔料裏享樂，如說是色彩代表感情，因此堆上紅紅綠綠的Mass卽是感情的强烈云云，這話是太誇張了的。抹煞線條，祇刷顔料，這種畫法是容易摹倣得像的。中國的塞尙之徒，僅祇爲了摹倣方便起見而歸了這一「宗」：摹倣是他們作品的全生命。而西湖藝專這　人偏不摹倣，無論國畫，西洋畫。你一看就使你鬆了束縳似地透過一口氣來。不過你如說這個是受了某人影響，那個是受了某人影響，這是有的。但也僅祇是影響，東西還是作者自已的東西。</p>
<p>至於内容，這次的藝展也當引起　　　的法意　　　　　眠氏，從前萬入生出　的摸索（如「摸索」），個人的慾望（如「生之慾」）而現在則發展到更廣大的一方面——像邠　「巷哀」，可並不是個人的悲哀，對着這幅畫，分邠有力的線條，熱色冷色的　置，誰也得有一種强烈的深刻的印象的。</p>
<p>在這不要内容，抹　線條，專門玩　利的　　弄得鳥烟瘴氣的時節，西　藝專用一個新的姿熊　了這展覽會，這是呌人十分快意的事。卽從藝術家的態度說，西湖藝專的師生們和那些大吹大擂的市儈藝術家也自不同。他們不　　，不請大人物題字，不自已加上什麽徽號，他們祇默默的努力習作着。他們很虚心，他們没自滿過。而他們有了這機的成績。</p>
<h3>安徽民間情歌二首</h3>
<p>— 瑞子</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>十七十八花一枝，再不尋郎等幾時，笋子出頭節節老，霜打樹葉漸漸稀，漸漸稀，無郎夜夜受孤凄。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>天上大星對小星，十八歲大姊尋郎到如今；也不知走過多少黑夜路，也不知受過多少恐和驚，站着又怕人看見，蹲着又怕蚊子釘，走到前村狗兒咬，走到後村老虎哼。只好大起膽子望前找，喚郎一聲駡一聲。</p>
<h3>絮語</h3>
<p>— 瑕厂</p>
<p>（十）（二）</p>
<p>前人小牘，頗多佳製。如張怡（白雲）與楚雲和尙云：「霪雨兼旬，苔侵灶額，晨突無烟。數息宴坐，因喜吟曰：萬綠陰中置此身，三旬九食未爲貧，若能辟穀應輕舉，誰與名山作主賓？拈呈吾師，乞一轉語。一是眞可謂窮而達者。又徐芳與陳公奏云：「積雨已自惱人，况是空山獨客？不有溪寺一行，此年春色，又付流水矣。暢菴小宴，甚佳，他處尋求，未必更勝。固宣安妥小住，擇善從之，無草草也。一亦殊飄逸有致，令人起田園之思。至於羅世珍（以獻）與譚紹成所云：「幽興入懷，忘却甗甕皆空，此皆貧者之不足，而造化佐之，不僅窮逹，抑且以自然作爲充飢之畫餅矣。</p>
<h3>暮（六）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>青松緩緩地從自已的座位裏站起來，走到青枝的近前，輕輕地把那支簫取過來；這時青校愕然地睜着掛滿了淚珠的眼睛望了她，好像是在問着爲什麽要這様做。</p>
<p>青松已經明白了她的疑問，她說着：</p>
<p>「姊姊，我就是怕你傷心，本來吹簫，就是一件費氣力的事，再要是落淚，那不是對身體太不好了麽？」</p>
<p>在說的時候，青松用了自已的乎絹爲青枝拭着臉上的淚痕，可是當青松也坐下去的時候，她們突然地相抱哭起來。</p>
<p>暮，像是漸漸地落下來了，蔚藍的秋之天，成爲深紫，又成爲深灰了，成羣的烏鴉在空中飛過去。這很容易使人想到了這古老的城，興衰是都在烏鴉呌着的聲音之中。或是一個預示，說這城，這城就要深深地沉入夜的黑暗之中。這頺然的景况裏，秋風還在捲着一片片飄下來的葉子，打在窗子上，吐着不爲人所明瞭的哀訴。它們是有過好時光的，在知道了將與時俱亡，就把一點的精力把自身成爲紅紅的艶艶的；可是，當着秋的日子得意地前進着，它們就從上面落下來，它們要爲人的及獸的脚所踐踏，　成了道旁的灰塵。但是蒼茫茫的暮色能把一切都包起來，没有美也没有醜，要使人們把什麽都忘記，都只成爲糢糊的影子。</p>
<p>暮景中，望到她們抱着的輪廓，那是早已失去了青春火熱的，惟無力地，像忍受了終身苦痛到都有了白髮的舊情人相遇，長而遠的悲傷的日子，使他們有吐不盡的酸楚；但是也只柔弱地，像兩枝枯了的籐蘿交纒着，打着抖的身軀在抱着。</p>
<p>她們都覺着腦子昏漲着，青松輕輕地推開了窗子。她們偎倚着望了窗外，無目的地看着，也好像得着空而大的韻味。在這沉寂之中，她們深深地體會到對她們身心上一點點的適宜。　　晚飯由女僕捧上來了，她們不得不開了燈，一時間眼睛感到了强烈的刺痛。但是，她們漸漸不覺到什麽了，可是在飯後，等着女僕把食具取出去，她們又是滅了燈，坐到窗下去；秋天的好月亮，又大又圓的升起來了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>新生活運動</h3>
<p>— 瘦子</p>
<p>最近蔣委員長在南昌舉行新生活運動，大意是以禮義廉恥爲生活之中心，要勤苦，要耐勞，要廉明整飭，這様才能做一個新國民。這是一件很有意義的事情。</p>
<p>目前國人的生活，確乎是太不新了。貪鄙，齷齪，無恥，下流，一切人類的惡德，差不多變成了我們社會現在唯一流行的風氣。不吃飯則已，要吃飯就非貪鄙，齷齪，無恥，下流不可，飯越吃的大，貪鄙，齷齪，無恥，下流也越利害。這眞是一椿很可痛心的現象。現在蔣委員長來提倡新生活運動，以禮義廉恥爲中心，眞可謂是對症發藥，多少可以挽回這一些風氣了。</p>
<p>不過我還有一點意見。古人說得好，「衣食足而知禮義」。可見要人民「知禮義一，必先使他能「衣食足」。「衣食足」是「知禮義」的一個唯一前提條件。又曰：「富而後敎」。就是要「敎」人民必先「富」人民，這意思與上一句是一様的。那末我們現在大部份的人能不能「衣食足」呢？是不是「富」呢？當然並不。我們所看見的，是整千萬農民的破産，整批工廠的减工或停業。現在人民所唯一需要的，似乎只是「衣食」兩字。在這様情形之下，能否去推行禮義廉恥，似乎多少有點問題。我不是說在現在情形之下，不能推行禮義廉恥，而是說在推行禮義廉恥之前，應稍稍看到人民的生計問題。因爲這是推行禮義廉恥的一個重要前提。所以，我希望蔣委員長於發起有意義的新生活運動之後，再來一個更有意義的使一般人民能「衣食足」能「富」的政策。假使這様，那蔣委員長的有功於人民，就不可企及了。這是一。</p>
<p>其次，現在我國除一般人民生活太不「新」外，一般的社會現象，也太不新了。紅丸，白麵，鴉片，苛捐，雜稅，貪官，污吏，土豪，劣紳，水災，旱災，兵災，以及各地軍人的混戰（如黔戰，孫馬衝突，以及才停不久的川戰）等，使得人民再也没有新的希望，社會再也没有光明的處所了。這些都是使我們社會唯一不「新」的原因。假使眞要使我們人民都能新，都能過新生活，我想以上幾個毒源，非先澈底除去不可。這幾個毒源不除去，我想恐怕人民要新也新不起來。社會是黑漆一團，人民窮不聊生，新的光明，呌他從何處發生呢？所以，我希望賢明的蔣委員長於提倡新生活以後，再來一個怎様可以使新生活澈底實現的更有意義的工作。這點，我想蔣委員長也大概已經計及到了罷。這是二。</p>
<p>以上是我的意見。最後，我希望國人大家都來擁護這一新生活運動。更擁護蔣委員長進一步怎様使這新生活可以澈底實現，就是怎様可以使人民「衣食足」使人民「富」，更怎様去澈底清除使這社會不能「新」的唯一毒源。這是一個重要工作。而且也唯有這様，才能使新生活運動變成更有意義。</p>
<h3>小生命</h3>
<p>— 淑賢</p>
<p>她生産後祗有一個星期，卽勇敢地扎掙着依然到工廠裏去工作，一方面故然是廠方給她限定的假期已滿，另一方面在她自已也很願意多一天拿到一點工鈿，能够在她那唯一的小生命身上多做點什麽。</p>
<p>天還未亮，她並不等工廠裏尖銳的回聲的催促自動地爬起了床，糊亂吃過兩碗冷飯，怱忙地從熱被窩裏將那熟睡的嬰孩抱起，慈愛而甜心地在那圓圓的小臉上親了一親，拿着十來塊破布將他緊緊地包札着，抱出大門，浴着稀疎的曉星的徽光，踏着冷靜悠長的馬路向工廠走去。</p>
<p>她現在是有了兒子的母親了！她將來無限的幸福和希望都在這兒子的身上，她要更努力地去好好養活着他，愛護着他，爲了他，她寗願挨受一切别人所不能挨受的苦痛！她一面走着一面這様地想。</p>
<p>朦朧的曙光之中，隠約可以看到那高聳的工廠裏的烟窗，和從窗口吐出斜流在天空的一綫可怕的黑色的烟霧。當她尙未被呑進那張大着血口似的工廠鐵攔門之先，卽用兩塊破布將那嬰孩的頭密密地遮蓋着，原後裝做無事鎭靜的神態緩緩地走過那眼睛放光的看門警察的身畔，表示這包裏裏着的並不是私帶犯禁的嬰孩，而是别的某種物件。</p>
<p>偷過工廠的大門，她輕輕地吐了一口氣一直走進車間裏。許多姊妹們好奇地圍聚了起來，大家爭先恐後地爭看着。讚美聲，賀喜聲，以及羨慕的太息聲</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>，七嘴八舌地嚷成一片。</p>
<p>換班的時間到了！姊妹們漸漸消散着去忙碌各人自已的工作。她將那機器下面的一塊蓋板揭開，將小生命塞進車肚的縫隙裏。</p>
<p>這是工廠中女工們私哺小孩最妥善的方法，那機器的車肚也是那些女工們的小孩唯一的秘密搖窩。機器的輪盤挨着小孩的身軀迅速地轉動着，紫黑色的機油一點一滴地滴到小孩的身上和頭上，但這一點也不會發生什麽異外的危險，祇要母親縳札的手段高明，那小孩會像聽話似的躺在裏面一動也不動。在那機聲隆隆的車間小孩的啼哭是完全不能聽到的，而且那嫩弱的小孩受着機器强度的震動自然會暈暈睡去。因此，祗要喂乳時縝密一點那是很難被廠方職員發覺的。</p>
<p>九點鐘到了！正是職員們換班休息的時候，如是她先央請了許多姊妹担任好四方的步哨，原後聚集着許多姊妹將自已緊緊地圍住，迅速地揭開機器蓋板將那小寳貝從車肚裏施出哺乳着。乳頭才塞進嬰孩的小嘴裏，猛然聽到步哨發來一個緊急信號，大家知道這是職員們來了，怱忙地將嬰孩依然藏好大家遣散着。</p>
<p>放工後，當她將那嬰孩從車肚裏拖出來時，她發現那嬰孩有點異様的變態，眼睛是那様地呆滯，小小的呼吸急促得使她害怕，紅潤的小臉上亦變成灰様的慘白。她這才記起了進工時有人曾警告過她，說這出世才祗七天的嬰孩不宜帶進工廠。如是她戰慄了！她看到有無邊的黑暗將臨到她身上。</p>
<p>當她經過第一道卡門時，她將一塊銀洋塞到那搜身女人的手裏，那女人狡猾地笑了一笑，向她輕輕地點一點頭，她卽被放過了。</p>
<p>出到工廠的大門，她一口氣跑回家裏，再仔細地去看那嬰孩時，嬰孩的吸呼這時已經停止了！但她並不哭，她只喊了一聲「天」，她的身子已撲到那小死屍上。</p>
<h3>流浪兒傳（九）</h3>
<p>— 陳靜生製</p>
<p>好傢伙　小把戲好厲害</p>
<h3>人生的喻義</h3>
<p>— 建設</p>
<p>望着那同是國人的侉哥兒，一拿着巡捕棒便盡力地打着江北老，驚異總是不能免的。本來想想侉哥兒也是中國人，江北老也是中國人，祇一點黠地域的差異，便有了這麽惡劣的感情，確然是値得驚異。因爲一般國人的　念，總以爲國人便好像是同　。</p>
<p>然而我仍舊要說，抱這種觀念的，是一點教最不懂得糞蛆的哲學。</p>
<p>我們若是打鄉下經過，並且留心過那鄉下的糞缸的，我們一定可以在那缸沿上發現比米還長兩倍的白色小蟲，而這便是糞蛆。假使我們若更留心，則一定更可發現這白色的小蛆並不是靜止在缸沿，而是一點一點，一會都不息地望，着缸沿的極上處猛力的爬。</p>
<p>它們之所以往上爬，一點都不用疑惑是有種純然的深刻的意義在。因爲一爬出了缸沿，它們便可以行着體態的變形，卽是在那黑色的蛹殼裏住上幾天，便可搖身一變而爲飛得起的噏噏然的蒼蠅。而這一點不用疑惑，便是出身，便是上進呀！</p>
<p>本來做蛆是不大出色的；並且蛆又是那麽多。而輾轉着的吃食着的祇是糞堆，糞。能够從别的蛆的頭上踏過去，把别的同類當做自已望上爬的墊脚磚，而一直爬上缸沿，行着蛻變，於是體態旣胖，又可飛行，並且又可以任所欲爲的去接近那些人世間的最可愛的最甜蜜的東西，這又那個糞蛆不想呢？</p>
<p>由我們看來，一匹蒼蠅本不見得是比糞蛆出色的。然而這在有些糞蛆，却顯見地不作這様想法。而這也是糞蛆和我們不同的地方，也卽是糞蛆之所謂哲學。</p>
<p>得糞蛆的哲學的，固然是懂得糞蛆想爬上缸沿的意義，然而想着一匹糞蛆竟也是那様難得爬上糞缸，其對於人生，怕也會感到這人生的索漢吧！</p>
<h3>也談减租運動</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>近來在馬路上常常發現一種白底藍字的標語，寫得一手很工整的隸書，而且詞句也很新鮮，最彰明的便是「要繁榮上海，必先减低房租」。這種口號，自然是非常合法的，不然少不了是像電桿柱上的黑字，上面被塗上一層石灰。隠隠約約，有如十八歲大小姐穿了粉紅色的蟬翼紗衣。但是前者並不令人消魂，反之却使人發生正義的憤感。因着這正正堂堂的標語，不免敎人想起「一二八」當時的店家門口所貼的「暴軍犯境，罷市禦侮」，以及後來的長期抵抗，忍痛開市」。那對仗工穏雖不如「風調雨順，國泰民安」等類似的春聯，可是其風格也就和春聯頗爲相似，假使那大砲聲便是放爆仗的話。</p>
<p>再說回頭罷，那末這减低房租的標語，到底還不是等因奉此的官様文章。而且也給人一種正義之感。但是，不久却讀了一派英雄好漢的大文，那說是要繁榮上海必先「安内」。大概也有一番無可比擬的理由，可惜自已不能領會也就不記得。不過！這様一來，所謂繁榮，也就頗成問題了。於是我也對這個問題想了一想。</p>
<p>就一般憂國之士來說，也許他們想得很透澈。譬如現在市面的蕭條，「大减價」一五個九折」等旗幟點綴着歌舞昇平的新年；假使减低了房租二元，便是增加了二元的購買力，於是國貨可以振興，而市面也就日臻榮，商店老閭喜笑顔開；未嘗不是在將死的病人身上打了一針嗎啡針。但是企圖以「匪」的血來繁榮上海，到底覺得是血腥味兒過於濃重，這只有吃人肉的人們才會如此兇惡。說起來眞是可怕得很。</p>
<p>住在上海的人，大概都知道得很清楚，上海的房租，果然是貴得可以。八十五兩一月的三層樓房或五十元一間大廂房固不必說，而祇能擺一張鐵床和一隻打字機台的小亭子間，在北京路一帶要租十元，在曹家渡也要七塊，至於糊了花紙的却要十四元以上了。</p>
<p>曾經有一學畫的朋友，租了一間每月十元的亭子間。因爲學畫的原故，便以木炭在白牆上畫着裸體女人。我問他道：「你爲什麽這様？」他很生氣的答道：「我一連住一　　一共是百二十元，已經好做成這一間小房子，這等於是我買了的，爲什麽不可畫？」這一說甚有理由，而其氣憤之程度，也就可想而知。</p>
<p>再說罷，假使夫妻二人同時做工，共可賺十五元一月，平均每天爲五角大洋，而房租便去了二角三分强，所剩下的二角六分，够什麽呢？每一個人一天吃兩碗陽春麵，也得大洋二角，還有三七二百一十文，便連吸球王牌泡開水在内。……這様算來，房租便去了收入的一半。一天十二小時在廠裏吸棉花毫，便得給房東大爺做六個鐘頭。這在太腹便便的吸血鬼固然開心，而工人們的血肉便爲地産業者自烟囱中飛去了一半。在業者旣然如此，至於失業者更是呌苦連天了。没有工做，没有飯吃，但是房租總得拿出來的，否則關進公安局，以正國法。</p>
<p>所以說，减租運動與其是繁榮上海，母寗是救救工人！</p>
<h3>國社黨的幽默</h3>
<p>— 中</p>
<p>國社黨的任務，在國社黨外交事務主任羅森培的嘴裏說明，確切的說明如下——</p>
<p>「國社黨所昭示於國民，以及所要求於國民者，固無需六千萬之德國人民，均予以贊成；其主要之點，乃在德國人民，必須均取同一態度而已！大約總理希脫拉信仰最久之一種思想，必有實現之一日———思想維何？卽國社黨之運動，必有一日成爲結晶，而能以一種命令代表之———此種命令又代表絕對威權，而黨之指揮，卽以此種命令行之！」</p>
<p>柏林三日哈瓦斯電。</p>
<p>此種演說眞是極盡委婉曲折之頂端，下一句還未說出，而先說出下一句的解釋，可謂小心翼翼極盡該黨之能事矣！</p>
<p>一言以蔽之！！「希脫拉的命令要全德人民一致遵守與奉行。」！！那末國社黨之任務維何？希脫拉之爲少數人的利益而發命令也！此爲一切任務之任務。</p>
<p>我們却不能相信希脫拉式之命令。</p>
<p>我們在這裏可以發現一個國社黨的政治公式！！</p>
<p>「黨的指揮」卽是「絕對威權」。「絕對威權」卽是「命令」。「命令」即是「希脫拉信仰最久之思想」！！卽是後臺老闆鋼鐵托拉斯大王的思想。</p>
<p>以土是抽象的公式，我們具體些立一公式！！</p>
<p>這是國社黨最最中心的政治政策。</p>
<h3>做官難</h3>
<p>— 光難</p>
<p>想來算去，一個人還是做官比較得計。升官發財，本是中國人做人的兩大目標，其實這二者是有着連帶關係。升了官，自然可以發財，發了財一定也就有官升，正是二而一。故我祗擇其一。　　然而官有時也不大易爲。例如近來蔣委員長通令要嚴禁宴會烟賭，豫魯兩主席也在提倡朝氣，這眞是官界的大厄運。你想，做官而不能恣情酒食徵逐，做官而要黎明卽起，這還算什麽官？這種官還好做？</p>
<p>夫人而旣官也，則洋房汽車女人，應有盡有，不思享樂，未免太不近理。且一個人做了官，親戚朋友自然而然也就多了起來，於是往還酬酢，勢所難免，欲不宴會烟賭而可得乎？但是蔣委員長却並不爲然，說什麽「憂患斯能圖存，怡憘適以召戾」，勉人「惕勵憂勤，痛自刻省」，不許「以酒食嬉遊相徵逐，以苟且偷安爲得計」，卽連烟賭亦懸爲厲禁，以爲此兩者一更足消磨志氣，失業廢時，實　亡國敗家之大　」，這不使人萬分掃興嗎？</p>
<p>今爲官者的取樂之途，旣被禁絕了，那末每位官員自晨至夕坐在辦公廳上忙碌了一天（？），早上貪睡幾時，原也不算得是愉懶，或至屈於規定辦公時間能趕到畫卯，也可說是盡職了。豈知豫魯兩主席，却並此一點清福也要剝奪乾凈，呌人要「聞鷄起舞」說這爲的是要「提倡朝氣，强壯身體」，你道倒霉不緻霉？</p>
<p>近來的中國，眞是什麽都變了，連做官也有些困難了！</p>
<h3>給我的朋友</h3>
<p>— 之</p>
<p>接到你遠從西子湖邊寄來的信，那麽熱情，那麽孤憤，那麽凄凉，那麽婉轉的發出一聲聲的人生之哀呌！</p>
<p>事情旣難如你的願，回去一轉也好，但回去也會更使你悲哀的。我底意思，你應該忍受目前的痛苦，不要太感情用事了，這時代一輩子也不會給我們有舒快之一日的，只要有一個中心的撑持生活之點，就可執着不放手。對於自已已往耗費的心血未得收穫之惘悵，雖屬人之常情，然也是不必要的。朋友，我要警告你一聲：懊悔之心太切，失望之念必深，弄得做人的火氣全消，那結局自然只有一條自殺自棄的路可走。</p>
<p>你和舒山的身世頗有相似之處，你們的性格，在好多方面亦有些相像，舒山自殺了，至今我們還深深隠藏着無可瀰補的創痛，我們一輩人聚在一塊兒追念到舒山的死，在家還不能忍住同聲一哭的眼淚！這種寒愴之情景，你應該透想一回，自殺自棄之念，也許會在你底腦中重新鼓動起波浪來。</p>
<p>我常說：悲觀的人，是有力量的，有勇氣的澈底的，積極的一種人生態度。自暴自棄，甚至自殺的人，都是太對人間樂觀了，樂觀容易使人失望，容易使人消極，容易使人落在悲傷之圈裏，不能自拔。</p>
<p>我們應做社會的人，國家的人，世界的人，有許多事，在個人方面是顚跛了，但就整體方面一看，是發出了光輝的。這種空話，在感情豐富的人不能不當作自已的理想而生活的。你有這様的理想麽？你現在是在一個實實的生活裏，决不能因目前的不如願事，而從根底上發出人生之疑問來！</p>

<h3>臉色變青</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>在本埠增刊的業餘信箱欄上，常見到許多疑難問題，都爲先生詳細解答。這眞使我敬仰佩服·現在我有一件難事，請你不棄而給我一個具體的答覆吧！</p>
<p>事情是這様的：</p>
<p>我的父親，是一個六十多歲在工廠裏辦事的職員·在從前（三年前）曾經開設一爿小公司。這是由九個股東的資本合設的。我的父親，是居最多的一股，所以就由各股東認爲經理。不幸的，做過二年三年後，因銷路的不暢，貨價的低賤，致蝕本關閉·我的父親，除自已所有股資完全蝕去外，當時還允負各股東的股資償還之責。</p>
<p>隔了一年，我的父親爲了股債的重壓，生活的强迫，就托親戚介紹，拖了衰老的身體，進工廠辦事，不到一年，我也再由親戚介紹，進了和我父親同一的廠中，做一個練習生，那時我正是十七歲了。</p>
<p>因爲薪俸的微少，還不能支付家裏的用費，所以更無法償還股東的債欵，我們是可以時常的接到各股東催索的信的。</p>
<p>在最近，接到一信，内有一……望在此數天内，立將債欵還清，否則，要到你家中坐吃住宿，並要報告官廳查辦，」等語。我的父親當時閱讀後，駭呆得臉色變青。因此，爲兒的我看了父親這様的着急，不得不向先生求敎了。</p>
<p>先生：這在法律上，有無此理嗎？我靜待着你的答覆。敬祝</p>

<h3>露露的勝利（十）（二）</h3>
<p>— 義大利Ｍ賽接歐著景心譯</p>
<p>一天晚上露露走進她的屋裏。「你肯帮我點忙麽？」她問。</p>
<p>「什麽事？」</p>
<p>「我有一點筆記要記，」露露說。「羅勃特獨自在外邊的洋臺上。你願不願去陪一陪他？」</p>
<p>「但是我！！」</p>
<p>「你願意一個人關在這兒麽？替我作一點事就這麽爲難麽？」</p>
<p>「你馬上就來麽？」</p>
<p>「我只要寫四行字就好了。」</p>
<p>蘇菲亞轉身向洋臺去，鼓着勇氣對此天罰。她在門口停了停。羅勃特來回地走着；她對他走去。</p>
<p>「露露呌我來的，」她低聲地說。</p>
<p>「你來得很勉强吧？」</p>
<p>「勉强！！。」</p>
<p>她的全身的纎維都震動起來了；羅勃特正在靠近她，他的面孔爲情慾所變形了。</p>
<p>「我作了什麽事使你不歡喜我，蘇菲亞？」</p>
<p>「没有計麽事。請你不要那様地望着我。」她請求着說，她嚇怕了。</p>
<p>「那麽，蘇菲亞，你曉得我是非常地愛着你。」</p>
<p>「啊！不要說呀，羅勃特，看在老夫的面上，不要說呀！露露如果聽見了可怎麽好！」</p>
<p>「我不愛露露。我愛你，蘇菲亞。」</p>
<p>「你是欺騙。」</p>
<p>「我我曉得的，但是我愛你。我願意走了！！」</p>
<p>「喔！露露在遠處呌着，在另一個門口邊上露出身來。「喔，你們兩個很安靜麽？」</p>
<p>「但是没有人回答。蘇菲亞逃走了，面孔隠藏在雙手裏；羅勃特動也不勳地呆在那里，靜默着，好像是暈過去了。</p>
<p>「羅勃特！」露露呌着。</p>
<p>「露露。」</p>
<p>「你怎麽了？」</p>
<p>「没有什麽事；我想要走了。」</p>
<p>都没有和她告别，他　想着艦望的輩態　　譜　　露露的眼睛跟　着他。</p>
<p>站在那兒忘形在思索中。</p>

<h3>Sun Plans to Reside in Taiyuan for an Extended Period</h3>
<p>Fu Zhankui Cables to Pang Ji and Others</p>
<p>Regarding the Settlement of Sun's Troops and Sun's Personal Living Expenses</p>
<p>Requests Pang Ji and Others to Petition He Yingqin for Assistance</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) A telegram from Suiyuan states that regarding Sun's military affairs, there is another turning point towards peace. The final result of the meeting between Fu and Sun is that Sun has agreed to leave the army and reside in Taiyuan with Fu for an extended period. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhankui cabled Bao Wenwei, forwarding it to Pang Bingxun and Hu Yikun, stating that he had met with Brother Dianying (Sun Dianying) to discuss his departure from the team, and there were no problems. After a brief settlement, he can travel to Beiping with me. All matters have been reported to He Yingqin by telegram. However, Brother Dianying is in an unusually difficult personal situation. Regarding the settlement of the individuals in his command, could you brothers discuss with Minister He to show consideration and alleviate some of the difficulties? Brother Dianying is determined not to make any demands, so I am asking you brothers to find a way to help. I would appreciate it if you could let me know your thoughts. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhankui sent a telegram to Hu Yukun, Ji Yiqiao, and Pang Bingxun this morning, stating that he had met with Sun and expressed very positive sentiments. However, Sun is facing a difficult situation and must first find a way to settle all his subordinates before leaving the army, and he hopes that the authorities will maintain his personal living expenses. Details have been reported to He Yingqin by telegram. He hopes that you brothers will urge the matter from the side to achieve an early realization. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Linhe states that Wang Jingguo's and Shi Jinwang's brigades, along with Zhao Chengshou's and Lu Sun's brigades, occupied Yangjiahe at noon on the 14th, killing over 170 Sun troops and capturing many. At 3 p.m., Xu Zizhen's regiment of Wang's brigade occupied Bulun Nur, and Zhao's cavalry occupied Dukoutang. Sun's troops were defending at Tianxingquan and Sanseungong, attempting to resist. Wang and Zhao are currently supervising the troops to advance, and a fierce battle is expected after noon on the 16th. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that a telegram from Zuo Yiyi arrived in Beiping this morning, reporting on the situation at the front, stating that all front-line troops have arrived at Yangjiahe. Zhao Chengshou arrived at Yangjiahe yesterday to command military affairs. The Jin-Sui army is very close to Sun's front line, and a major battle could erupt at any moment. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military news reports that Ma Hongbin and others cabled on the 14th, stating that Sun's cavalry brigade, led by Li Chunhua, defected with over 600 troops on the night of the 13th. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Jin-Sui army actively advanced westward, Sun's troops, feeling attacked from both sides, had their morale shaken. Peng Zhenguo, Yu Shiming, and other units expressed their willingness to surrender and accept reorganization. Yang Hou's small unit has suffered heavy losses in repeated battles. The Ningxia and Qinghai armies will launch a pincer attack after the Jin-Sui army advances to a suitable location. Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengshou are currently commanding military affairs in Linhe. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Ningxia The Commander of the Independent Second Brigade, Wu Cunyi, publicly announced his separation from Sun Dianying. The original telegram stated: Central Party Headquarters, National Government, President of the Executive Yuan Wang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee Chiang, He Yingqin, Chairman of the Beiping Military Branch, Zhang, Deputy Commander of Hankou, esteemed officials, ministers, commissioners, pacification directors, anti-bandit deputy commanders, general commanders, army and division commanders, provincial and municipal governments, party departments at all levels, legal organizations, news agencies, and to the national public: Cunyi, seeing the country in danger and the Northeast fallen, rose up to resist Japan, disregarding sacrifice, originally to fight for the survival of our great Chinese nation. Unexpectedly, since advancing westward, after more than a month of stalemate, nine out of ten homes are empty, the old and young are displaced, a truly pitiful sight. Spring plowing has been missed, rural areas are bankrupt, and livelihoods are cut off. Added to this is fratricide, harming the nation's vitality and giving the Japanese invaders a good opportunity to invade North China. Reading the poems of the ancients about brothers fighting each other and resisting insults from outside, how can one not feel sorrow? Cunyi is unwilling to harm the country with patriotism, nor can he bear to disturb the people with love for them. Therefore, on the 7th, he led his troops to break away from the Sun army, stationed on the west bank of the Yellow River, connecting Ningxia and Shuozhou, and has made contact with the National Army. From now on, he will follow the orders of Chairman He of the Beiping Military Branch, based on the former sincerity of supporting the central government and the spirit of loving peace. Cunyi's actions are purely driven by righteousness, hoping to leave a glimmer of hope for our nation, with no selfish interests involved. This heart is clear and can be witnessed by heaven and earth. Whether you know me or blame me, I hope that the virtuous and talented people in the country will teach me. Wu Cunyi, Commander of the Independent Second Brigade, and all military officers kowtow and seal. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>South Tianmen Fake Police</p>
<h3>Withdrawal Still Unsettled</h3>
<p>Yongjian Flies to Chengde and Has Not Returned</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of the withdrawal of the fake national border police at South Tianmen, the Ji-Mi District Office and the Gubeikou Office have been negotiating with the Japanese. Yongjian, the commander of the 25th Regiment of the Japanese garrison in Gubeikou, previously flew to Chengde to meet with Matsui to request instructions. He has not yet returned, and the results of the negotiations are unknown. The fake police are still performing inspection duties. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Eastern Chahar</p>
<h3>Increasing Transportation of Supplies</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan Scheduled to Return to Chahar via Beiping</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in Eastern Chahar remains tense. The Japanese are continuously increasing troops and transporting supplies to the Guyuan and Ersi districts. Song Zheyuan telegraphed Beiping, stating that he would come to Beiping on the 17th and summoned Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying to come to Beiping the day after tomorrow to report on the situation in Eastern Chahar. Song will visit Huang and He to discuss countermeasures before returning to Chahar. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>League of Nations Advisory Committee</p>
<h3>We Will State Our Position</h3>
<p>Rumors of Appointing Gu Weijun or Guo Taiqi as Representatives</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, the League of Nations Advisory Committee will convene in Geneva on May 14. We will send representatives to attend. The selection of representatives has not yet been determined, but it may be Gu Weijun or Guo Taiqi who will travel there from nearby. At that time, we will submit a memorandum stating the current situation and our position. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<h3>Receives Education Commissioners from Nine Provinces</h3>
<p>Inquires and Provides Guidance on the Political Situation in Each Province</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Discusses Financial Matters with Chiang</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Education Commissioners from nine provinces, the Secretaries-General of the provincial governments, and the administrative commissioners listened to Chairman Chiang's instructions in Jiangxi. Chiang has ordered that they be received in the order of their arrival and inquired and provided guidance on the political situation in each province. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) After Kong Xiangxi arrived in Jiangxi, he discussed financial matters with Chiang. Sun and Chiang discussed various constitutional draft proposals. Sun advocated that the whole country should sincerely unite and unanimously assist Chairman Chiang in suppressing the Red bandits and ensuring internal peace and external defense. He also strongly urged all parties not to establish their own flags, which would cause the political center of gravity to be lost and invite foreign insults. Ma Chaojun also arrived in the province. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) In order to improve politics and promote post-war reconstruction in the recovered areas, Chiang summoned the administrative chiefs of ten provinces to Jiangxi to give instructions on everything. Originally scheduled for the 15th, it has been postponed because the number of people has not yet arrived and the reports from each province have not been printed in time. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Tingyao, commander of the 17th Army, arrived in Nanjing on the 15th and visited Zhu Peide and Zhang Zhizhong. He is scheduled to take a boat to Jiangxi on the 16th to listen to instructions. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Tao Shangming Discusses</p>
<h3>The Situation at Various Passes of the Great Wall</h3>
<p>Tao Will Inspect with Yi Wo</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming stated that after receiving Shanhaiguan, the local area is still peaceful. Although the Japanese army and military police have not withdrawn, they do not interfere in politics. The fake customs at Shanhaiguan still collect export duties, and we have also set up customs in Shanhaiguan to collect taxes. The post and telecommunications bureau has not yet been restored due to housing problems. Su Yuqi, the director of the Public Security Bureau, has dispatched personnel to Lengkou, Jieling, Xifengkou, Panjiakou, and other passes to set up public security branch offices and station police, which is no different from formal reception. In the future, public security sub-bureaus will be established according to the importance of each pass to assist in governing the area. Xifengkou is more important, and a sub-bureau may be established. Except for Shimentun, Jianchangying, and Saheqiao, there are no Japanese troops stationed at each pass. Outside the pass are all fake troops, who also talk to our police from time to time. I plan to return to Tangshan in one or two days and first inspect Qian'an. After that, I will go to Shanhaiguan and inspect each pass with Yi Wo. The Luyu District Administrative Conference will be convened soon, but the date has not yet been set. We will still negotiate to recover the territory of Hebei Province outside the Great Wall. Rumors that Yi Wo is negotiating to demarcate the boundary are inaccurate. The fake side has merged the areas of Qian'an and Funing counties that protrude outside the Great Wall and the Dushan Administrative Bureau and named it Qinglong County. In addition, we are actively working on wartime transportation. The telephone has been presented with a request to build several main lines, such as Haiyang and Jianchangying, following the example of Jimen, which will cost about 50,000 yuan. There were many ronin gathered in Tangshan, but they have gradually been cleared up. When Puyi usurped the throne, slogans were not found in Shanhaiguan. There were postings at the stations and bathhouses in Tangshan and other places, but the people regarded them as just another kind of picture. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Gold Mines in Northern Hebei</p>
<h3>Mostly Forcibly Occupied by Japanese</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang and Xing, residents of Xinglong County, Northern Hebei, came to the province and submitted a petition to the Construction Department, requesting them to negotiate with the Japanese to return the gold mines in Xinglong County owned by the residents. According to them, all the gold mines in Xinglong County outside the Great Wall, covering more than ten acres, have been forcibly occupied by the Japanese, who are cooperating with traitors to mine them. The gold mines in the Daoxiaoliushui and Malanyu River gold districts are the best gold mines in Northern Hebei. Japanese soldiers are stationed there to protect Japanese nationals who are mining. The Xinglong County magistrate is controlled by Japanese soldiers for setting up an office in Malanyu and does not dare to express his opposition. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Those Who Sent Telegrams to Congratulate the Traitor Puyi</p>
<h3>Should Be Reported Immediately</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A member of the Central Committee said that the central government has recently received secret reports from various places that some surviving Qing elders and speculators among the bureaucrats sent letters of recommendation or congratulatory telegrams before the traitor Puyi usurped the throne. This act clearly betrays the Republic of China and should be reported as soon as possible as a warning to those who are willing to betray the country. A telegram has been sent to the party headquarters of each province and city and the administrative agencies to comply with this order, quickly investigate whether there are any Qing officials or surviving subjects who have committed the above-mentioned acts, and report the facts truthfully by telegram for investigation and handling. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to intelligence from outside the pass, a large number of traitors have gone from inside the pass to Changchun to congratulate Puyi on ascending the throne. They include Wu Kun, who impersonates a representative of the people of North China, Ji Ruiwu, who impersonates a representative of the people of Beiping, Jin Jia, who impersonates a representative of the Western Regions Hui generals, and Kong Xicheng, who impersonates a representative of the Tibetan princes. In addition, Chang Yuqing and Guan Zhiqing, who took the initiative in the January 28 Incident in Shanghai, have also arrived in Changchun one after another. Hao Peng, the former head of the Zhili Finance Department, is now in charge of contacting and sending messages to traitors in Beiping and Tianjin. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>British Verbal Response</p>
<h3>Protest Against the Ban Hong Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the British invasion of the Ban Hong area of Lancang County, Yunnan Province, and the protection of the Burma Company to mine for gold and silver, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the British side. According to diplomatic circles, the British side has already given a verbal reply. The crux of this case still involves the treaty signed by Minister Xue Fucheng and the British Foreign Office in 1899 during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. Due to the original map of the demarcation, the location of Ban Hong is under the jurisdiction of Shang Hūlú, also known as the Wild Man Mountain, bordering Shuangjiang County in the east and Burma in the west. In fact, it is indeed our country's territory. The general trend of this case in the future is that both sides will send personnel to re-survey and demarcate the boundary line. Materials are currently being collected. In addition, the Ministry of Industry believes that this action by the British is actually seizing our country's mining rights. In addition to asking the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the truth, it has also ordered the Yunnan Construction Department to quickly investigate and report the details so that it can formulate opinions and send them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for reference during negotiations. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>President Wang Jingwei Supports</p>
<h3>The New Life Movement</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang believes that the New Life Movement is extremely important to the future of the nation, and the measures taken are in line with his usual lifestyle. He has joined the sponsors of the Promotion Association. The association is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting at the Lizhi Society on the morning of the 16th, with Zhu Jiahua as chairman, and Chen Lifu, Wang Shijie, Chu Minyi, and others will give speeches. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Long Ciyun, the political training director of the 7th Division, believes that Chiang Kai-shek's promotion of the New Life Movement is to correct customs and save people's hearts. On the 15th, he jointly discussed with the county party department and the county government to form the Xuzhou New Life Movement Promotion Association and scheduled a mass rally on the 29th. Preparations began immediately. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Resolution of the Central Executive Committee</p>
<h3>Special Liver Cancer Treatment Award Established</h3>
<p>Deng Zuyin and Others Appointed as Party Affairs Design Committee Members in Fujian</p>
<p>An Futing Appointed as Representative to the International Labor Conference</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee held its 113th regular meeting on the morning of the 15th. More than 30 people attended, including Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Gu Mengyu, Wang Zhaoming, Lin Sen, Shao Yuanchong, Deng Jiayan, Chen Lifu, Bai Yunti, Chu Minyi, Zhou Qigang, Chen Bijun, Wang Zhengting, and Hong Ludong. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting and resolved the following important cases: (1) Approved the appointment of Deng Zuyin, Tang Demin, Zhan Shaohuan, Chen Meian, Fang Zhongzheng, Xie Dongshan, and Zhu Wanlin as members of the Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Design Committee. (2) Approved the proposal to establish a special liver cancer treatment award with four attached measures: (1) The Central Executive Committee will establish a liver cancer treatment award of 50,000 yuan to commemorate Sun Yat-sen. (2) Any Chinese or foreign medical expert who can make a significant invention for the treatment of liver cancer and has proven its success through detailed experiments will be awarded this award by the committee. (3) This award will be funded by donations from party comrades collected on various occasions and will not be paid from the national treasury. (4) The committee will appoint three members to be responsible for carrying out this matter. (3) Approved the appointment of An Futing as the labor representative to the 18th International Labor Conference, with Cheng Haidao as consultant and Zhang Yi as secretary. (5) Nominated Zhu Jiahua to attend the next Central Memorial Week to report. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>At the time of the meeting of Italy, Austria, and Hungary in Rome, foreign telegrams have been received that the situation in Central Europe seems to be increasingly complex. Not only the rumors of Austria's restoration and the news of Germany and the Little Entente's preparations for war are rampant, but also the claims that Italy is increasing troops in the north and colluding with the Little Entente, that Hitler is sharpening his sword and approaching Yugoslavia, are also being discussed. Whether the meeting of Italy, Austria, and Hungary is an economic meeting or not is a matter of debate. If this intricate and deceitful situation will lead to a second world war, whether the Little Entente will eventually lean towards Germany or resolutely join hands with Italy, or still rely on France, whether Italy's actions can be ignored by Britain and France, or will cause greater turbulence, are all issues that deserve attention.</p>
<p>However, by synthesizing the facts and weighing the current situation, we know that although the situation in Central Europe is very tense, it has not yet reached the point of a major war. The contradictions between the countries of Central Europe were caused by the peace treaty after the war. Since the signing of the treaty, the tense situation between the countries has been seen many times, but they have all been able to return to calm. This is because the disaster of war is too great, so they all dare not be the first to start a war easily. However, if these treaties are not revised one day, the opportunity for war in Europe will inevitably not be cut off for one day. If the opportunity for war is not cut off, there will inevitably be a day when it breaks out. Once it breaks out, it will be a major war, and the countries of Europe will inevitably suffer both losses. Taking today as an example, if Germany decides to invade Austria, war will inevitably break out. If Austria is restored, war cannot be avoided. If the combination of Italy, Austria, and Hungary is political rather than just economic, then war is even more unavoidable.</p>
<p>In short, if any of these occur, war can break out. If Germany invades Austria, it will be enough to threaten Italy and will be particularly detrimental to Czechoslovakia. Therefore, Italy and Czechoslovakia will inevitably participate in the war. At this time, the war will become a war between Germany and Austria, Italy, and Czechoslovakia. If Austria is restored, although it will be beneficial to Italy, it will be particularly detrimental to Hitler's Germany and the Little Entente. Therefore, Germany and the Little Entente will inevitably act simultaneously and approach Austria. At this time, Austria, Hungary, and Italy will be one group, and Germany and the Little Entente may be another group. Hitler's opposition to the restoration of Austria-Hungary is probably because his desire to merge Austria and build a "Third Reich" cannot be realized. The reason why the Little Entente opposes the restoration of Austria-Hungary is that most of the land of the Little Entente is the former territory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the war, and the various ethnic groups of the Little Entente have suffered the pain of being enslaved and ruled by the Habsburg imperial family. If the restoration is successful, then Austria-Hungary, which has been thinking about getting rid of the shackles of the treaty, will take advantage of Italy's assistance and prepare to restore its lost land. Therefore, the fear of recovery is more intense than that of Germany. This can be confirmed by past facts without any doubt. For example, on March 27, 1921, when Charles of the Habsburg imperial family came to Hungary to usurp the throne, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia coordinated their troops to invade Hungary. Within three weeks, Charles fled again. The political and economic alliance of the Little Entente was also founded at this time. The Little Entente Convention was concluded in February last year. The combination of these three countries is a further step. The most notable is the coordination of the three countries' diplomacy and economic cooperation, which is almost the same as one country. All of this is prompted by the concern about the restoration of Austria-Hungary. Therefore, Austria-Hungary will not be restored today. If it is restored, the attack of the Little Entente will inevitably precede that of Germany. If so, then Italy and Germany will be difficult to sit idly by. Therefore, if Austria is restored, war cannot be avoided. But can war be avoided if Austria is not restored? This depends on whether the nature of today's meeting between Italy, Austria, and Hungary is economic or political. If it is economic, then it is just to find an economic outlet for Austria and Hungary, which can be tolerated by all parties. If it is political, then it has the suspicion of changing the current territory of Central Europe and will inevitably cause the resistance of the Little Entente and will also lead to the intervention of France and Britain. Therefore, if Mussolini acts arbitrarily, it will also be enough to cause war to break out.</p>
<p>However, judging from the current situation, Mussolini does not seem to be so reckless. Mussolini has repeatedly said that the scope of this meeting is limited to economics and does not involve politics. At the same time, there is also talk of expanding the meeting and recruiting the Little Entente. It can be seen that Mussolini's intention is only to target Germany and does not want to make the Little Entente feel uneasy. Moreover, Italy is the initiator of the Four-Power Pact and cannot abandon the treaty revision path stipulated by the Four-Power Pact and directly discuss the border issues of Central Europe with Austria and Hungary privately. Therefore, this meeting will not cause the hostility of the Little Entente. However, it is very difficult to win over the Little Entente to join the combination of Italy, Austria, and Hungary. If the Little Entente can cooperate with Austria and Hungary economically, then the economic problems of the Danube River basin can be solved to a considerable extent. It is not necessary for Italy to advocate for it today. Looking at the Treaty of Trianon, it clearly stipulates that Czechoslovakia can cooperate economically with Austria and Hungary for five years. However, due to the incompatibility, suspicion, and jealousy between the nations, this clause has become a dead letter. France also had a plan for Danube economic cooperation the year before last, but it failed because the Little Entente was unwilling to comply and Germany and Italy wanted to expand the scope. Based on this speculation, it can be known that the Little Entente will inevitably be difficult to join the combination of Italy, Austria, and Hungary in the future. In the future, the Little Entente will not be convenient to rely on Italy or to be close to Germany. Judging from the situation, in addition to seeking unity on its own, it may still have to collude with France.</p>
<p>In a word, whether the war in Europe breaks out or not depends on the policies of Germany, Italy, and Austria. If Germany can assess its strength and act cautiously, war can be avoided. If Italy has no intention of changing the border of Central Europe, war can also be avoided. If Austria does not restore the monarchy, war should have no reason to break out.</p>
<h3>Yen Hui-ching Arrived in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Go to Jiangxi to Visit Chiang Kai-shek Soon</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yen Hui-ching, the ambassador to Russia, arrived in Pukou from Tianjin at 1 p.m. on the 15th and entered the city with his younger brother Deqing. He went to the official residence at No. 7 of the Ministry of Railways and rested briefly before taking a car to Beijige to visit Song Ziwen and talked for an hour. Then, he visited President Wang at the official residence and reported something. In the evening at 7 p.m., Minister Wang Guangqi and Chen Yanjiong, the director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, held a banquet at Ming Yongchun to welcome Yen, and Vice Minister Xu Mo and the directors of various departments were invited to accompany him. Yen will go to Jiangxi soon to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the diplomatic situation between China and Russia and his personal opinions on diplomacy. He will also meet with Russian Ambassador Bogomolov in Beijing. The date of his return to Russia to resume his post has not yet been decided. According to the Russian Consulate, the Russian ambassador plans to meet Yen on the 16th in order to strengthen friendly relations. According to diplomatic circles, the meeting between Ambassador Yen and the Russian ambassador is only a social occasion in the international community and will at most only exchange opinions on ordinary diplomatic matters. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yen Hui-ching told reporters that he returned to China last month because he had family affairs to deal with, so he returned to Tianjin. Now that he has settled everything, he has specially come to Nanjing to visit the government authorities and discuss diplomatic issues in detail. He will stay in Beijing for a few days before going to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places to visit relatives and friends and go to Ji to visit Chiang Kai-shek to report on the international situation. However, the time has not yet been decided. He felt that the national concept of the people was very weak and that the national spirit was even more depressed, which was regrettable. At the beginning of the month, the traitor Puyi usurped the throne in Changchun, which did not attract the attention of the country, but the Japanese said that our ambition had become even more intensified. At that time, the Japanese army in Tianjin took the opportunity to hold exercises to demonstrate to us and extorted vehicles, making things difficult for us everywhere. Their intentions were even more sinister. At this time when the country's situation is precarious, the people of the whole country should be greatly enlightened, unite as one, and help the government to overcome the difficulties. They must not divide themselves and invite their own destruction. Yen also said that the difficulty of our country's situation today is known to everyone, but there is still room for diplomatic activity. However, there are many prescriptions, but I don't know if the patient is willing to take them. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Yen Hui-ching passed through Xuzhou on the Pingpu train this morning and went to Beijing. It is said that after Yen visits Wang, he will go to Shanghai. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Japanese Military Attaché Shibayama</p>
<h3>Hosts a Banquet for the Beiping Press</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Military Attaché Shibayama hosted a banquet for the Beiping press at Changchunting on the evening of the 15th, accompanied by Japanese Embassy Counselor Harada, Military Attaché Nemotoya, Ogi, and others. After taking their seats, Shibayama stood up and gave a speech, saying that the people of China and Japan were originally united as one, but due to less contact, they became estranged and could not understand each other. In the future, he hoped that they would support each other and promote the happiness of East Asia. Furthermore, Military Attaché Nemoto of our embassy will be transferred to the news section chief of the Ministry of the Army and will leave China. In the future, he will make contributions to the liaison and improvement of Chinese and Japanese news. If you have any instructions, he will accept them sincerely and welcome the Chinese press to visit our country for inspection. Today, I have prepared some drinks to wish you good health. There were also dancing and magic performances to add to the fun, and the banquet did not end until midnight. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

The date of the meeting will be decided after Nima and others return to Bailingmiao, probably no later than mid-April.

<p>Xinjiang Construction Association</p>
<h3>Holds Second Meeting</h3>
<p>President Wang Attends and Addresses the Meeting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Xinjiang Construction Planning Committee held its second meeting at 2 p.m. on the 15th, with 47 people present. Chu Minyi chaired the meeting, and President Wang also attended and addressed the meeting, saying that the government considers the Xinjiang issue to be extremely important and has established the Construction Committee to gather people familiar with the situation in Xinjiang to jointly study the construction of Xinjiang. The most important thing is to develop transportation and build railways, which is a fundamental solution, but it requires funds and time. The initial solution is to build roads for automobiles. Secondly, Xinjiang's finances are extremely chaotic and need to be reorganized urgently. The nationalities are complex, and their development and ability should be supported. All of these issues are expected to be studied in detail and contributed as much as possible. As for the military and political affairs of Xinjiang, the central government is planning effective solutions and will not use force as the only tool. However, the diplomatic power should be centralized. The central government has taken over the various consulates established by the provincial government in the Soviet Union, etc. Then, the outline of the construction plan and the work procedures were discussed, and it was decided to divide them into four groups, and the members were asked to identify the groups. The chairman appointed the conveners, including Tang Kesan and Zhang Ximan for the political group, Chen Zengliang and Luo Jing for the economic group, Wang Zengshan and Liu Lunying for the cultural group, and Li Jingcong and Feng Youzhen for the transportation group. The detailed items of the outline will be discussed at the third meeting on the 17th. The work procedures are roughly divided into three stages: organization, preparation, and completion, which are scheduled to be completed in three months. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Three-Headed Meeting at Villa d'Este</p>
<h3>Guaranteeing the Independence of Austria and Hungary</h3>
<p>Full Discussion of Mussolini's Policies</p>
<p>Economic Transformation of the Danube River</p>
<h3>Italy Has Lofty Ambitions</h3>
<p>German Foreign Minister Quietly Goes to Rome with an Important Mission</p>
<p>Rome The three-headed meeting of the prime ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary made significant progress on Thursday afternoon. This morning, the King of Italy entertained the two distinguished guests with a grand banquet at the Royal Palace. In the afternoon, the three prime ministers held their first meeting at Villa d'Este, where they had a full discussion of "Mussolini's policies." The purpose is to maintain the economic and political independence of Austria and Hungary and to create an Italian sphere of influence in the upper reaches of the Danube River. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Foreign Minister Neurath quietly left Berlin for Rome yesterday. It is reported that he will meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to discuss the Nazi Party's incident in Austria. The purpose of this trip is to discuss the current situation between Germany and Austria with the Italian Prime Minister and Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös. It is reported that the German Foreign Minister's trip also carries an important mission from German Chancellor Hitler. He will discuss with Italy the possibility of Germany rejoining the League of Nations within two years of its withdrawal from the League of Nations, if necessary. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome The Prime Ministers of Italy, Hungary, and Austria continued to meet in Rome today to discuss assisting Hungary and Austria in suppressing Germany's cunning plan to annex the two countries through the Nazi Party. It is said that German Vice-Chancellor Papen will also attend the meeting on Thursday to explain Germany's position and consolidate Germany's position. According to news from here today, Prime Minister Mussolini proposed that Trieste and Fiume be designated as free zones for Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Mussolini's move has two purposes: first, to undermine Germany's control over exports from Hungary and Austria; second, to restore the priority of railway transportation between Trieste and Fiume to Austria, so as to compete with the railway from Vienna to Hamburg, Germany. The railway from Vienna to Hamburg is an important route for Hungary and Austria to reach northern ports. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome Prime Minister Mussolini met with Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös yesterday and Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss today, but the three have not yet met at the same time. According to general opinion, the outcome of the talks between the three countries will be nothing more than the publication of a joint declaration, reaffirming the friendly relations between the three countries, and not the conclusion of an agreement of a political nature. As for economic matters, the three prime ministers are unlikely to conclude an agreement of a definitive nature, such as a commercial treaty. What is planned is a non-triangular organization, which other countries such as Czechoslovakia and Germany can join after its establishment. The three countries are also striving to reach an understanding on the issue of the economic reorganization of the Danube River countries. This work is based on the Italian memorandum of September 29 last year. The Italian government sent notes to the signatory countries of the Four-Power Pact and the countries that became independent after the dissolution of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire (i.e., Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia), suggesting that the economic reorganization of the Danube River countries be carried out and expanded in accordance with the method decided by the Stresa Conference the year before, and that it be applied uniformly to most agricultural products. (14th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome This morning, Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss laid a wreath at the Italian Royal Mausoleum and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. At noon, he had a secret talk with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and then attended the banquet of Sir Mada. According to semi-official news, Italy's "Danube River Policy" towards Italy, Austria, and Hungary is the same as the policy of the Little Entente countries, and seeks mutual understanding so that they can respond to each other. The meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the two Prime Ministers Dollfuss and Gömbös is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon. Tomorrow at noon, they will attend the Italian King's luncheon. This afternoon, the three cabinet ministers and the King of Siam visited the cavalry school to watch equestrian performances. At 6 p.m., Prime Ministers Gömbös and Dollfuss will meet and have a long secret talk in the Grand Hotel. In the evening, Dollfuss and the Italian ambassador to Austria will be received by the Roman Pope, and then attend Mussolini's grand banquet. In addition to the two state guests, all senior officials and all diplomatic envoys were invited to the banquet. Tomorrow night, the two distinguished guests will be invited to watch a play at the Royal Theatre of Bayreuth. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Morning Before Yesterday</p>
<h3>Held Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>Agreed on the Basis for Economic Negotiations</p>
<p>Revision of Treaty Not Expected to Be Discussed</p>
<p>London No important news came out of Rome yesterday. The Prime Ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary are scheduled to hold their first official meeting this afternoon to discuss how to guarantee the continued independence of Austria and Hungary economically and politically. A preparatory meeting was held yesterday, the most important of which was the meeting between the Italian Prime Minister and the Austrian Chancellor in the morning, where they reportedly discussed the method of tariff preferences and quotas between Italy and Austria, and the convenience that Austria and Hungary could enjoy in Trieste and Fiume. It is reported that Italy is willing to buy more Austrian machinery and industrial products, while Austria is willing to buy more Italian agricultural products, especially wine, but not much grain, because Austria will buy grain from Hungary. The Hungarian Prime Minister also had a long talk with the Austrian Chancellor yesterday morning, and then went to see the German Ambassador to Italy.</p>
<p>Last night, the Austrian Chancellor told reporters that the joint plan is now under discussion and should be announced before Easter. It is reported that the revision of the treaty was not discussed yesterday, and may not be discussed even at today's meeting.</p>
<h3>Afternoon Visit to Cavalry Drills</h3>
<p>This afternoon, the three prime ministers, along with the King of Siam and others, watched the horsemanship performance at the Cavalry School. In the evening, the Roman Pope summoned the Austrian Chancellor to inquire about the recent situation in Austria. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>It is Reported That Italian Military Supplies</p>
<h3>Go From Austria to Hungary</h3>
<p>Causing Panic Among the Danube Countries</p>
<p>Austrian Home Guard Concentrated and Waiting for Orders</p>
<p>(London) The Danube countries are greatly alarmed by the rumor that Italian military supplies are being transported to Hungary. Although the official arena in Vienna has tried hard to refute this rumor, it persists. It is said that two trains fully loaded with military supplies passed through Austria and entered Hungary on March 8 and 9. A newspaper in the capital of Yugoslavia even claimed that there was evidence that military supplies were indeed transported from Italy to Austria. If Italy takes such action, it will be impossible for the Little Entente countries to participate in economic cooperation. It is now planned to ask the League of Nations to control the military equipment of Austria and Hungary. Officials in the Hungarian capital pointed out that this rumor has no basis. Hungarian newspapers said that this rumor originated in the Little Entente countries with the aim of disrupting the current negotiations in Rome. Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss is currently in Rome, and the leader of the Austrian Home Guard reorganized his subordinates in Vienna yesterday, reportedly intending to concentrate all his forces under Vice-Chancellor Fey.

<h3>Austrian Restoration Movement</h3>
<p>Methods of Struggle Do Not Go Beyond the Scope of the Law</p>
<p>Only Seek the Restoration of the Royal Family and Oppose the Union of Austria and Hungary</p>
<p>Vienna Weissner, one of the leaders of the Austrian monarchist legitimists, explained the current situation of the Habsburg royal family's restoration to representatives of Austrian and foreign newspapers here. Weissner solemnly stated that once the Austrian order banning the entry of the old royal family is lifted, the royal family will immediately return to reside in their own country. He also said that the methods of struggle used by the legitimists will never go beyond the scope of the law. He rejected the claim that Austria and Hungary should implement a monarchical union system, because the legitimists only seek the Austrian throne. (14th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Whether the British Plan is Accepted</p>
<h3>The Success or Failure of the Disarmament Issue Depends On This</h3>
<p>Eden Spoke Eloquently in the House of Commons</p>
<p>Hope that Britain, the United States, and Japan Maintain Close Cooperation</p>
<p>The British Conservative Party Advocates Swift Action to Negotiate an Air Force Agreement</p>
<p>A Convention, Even If Incomplete, is Better Than Nothing</p>
<p>The French Foreign Affairs Committee Passed a Resolution Opposing German Military Build-Up</p>
<p>Insisting on Implementing Disarmament Under a Monitoring System</p>
<p>France's Reply to Britain's Note Postponed Until the End of Next Week</p>
<p>(London) Sir Eden stated in the House of Commons today that since his visits to the authorities of various European countries, he has become more convinced that the success or failure of the Disarmament Conference depends on whether or not the countries can accept the British plan. The British plan has been detailed in the recent disarmament memorandum submitted to the countries. Eden's response to the Labour Party's attacks on the government's remarks was very painful. The Labour Party believes that the government lacks decisiveness and understanding of the Disarmament Conference, which has aroused external fears of war. Eden continued, saying that the government will study the replies from Italy, France, and Germany with a sympathetic and understanding attitude. The government also firmly believes that the countries of the world will not want the failure of the Disarmament Conference. Eden also said that what he heard in Paris, Berlin, and Rome makes him more convinced that the successful agreement of the Disarmament Conference is none other than the British Disarmament Memorandum. Qiang accused Foreign Minister Simon of expressing a lukewarm attitude towards the US disarmament proposal. Simon denied this, saying that the US has never made any consideration of being on an equal footing with Germany in disarmament matters. Outsiders claim that the US is unwilling to cooperate with the countries in seeking the success of the Disarmament Conference. Eden pointed out that this statement is absurd. Eden declared that the US has been of great help in drafting the treaty in the disarmament discussions. One point that the Disarmament Conference is encouraging is the close cooperation between Britain and the United States. Observers believe that Britain, the United States, and Japan will prepare for the largest naval competition in history. In terms of shipbuilding plans, the United States is of course the only one. However, the US warships are already outdated, so it is doubtful whether the US can occupy a leading position. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Lord Privy Seal of England, Eden, today described his European tour to promote disarmament in the House of Commons, and his words were quite optimistic, saying that it is not easy to reconcile the opinions of France and Germany, but it is not yet possible to be pessimistic when the documents in response to the British proposal have not been fully received. When a member asked if there was no hope of trying to reconcile the opinions of France and Germany, Eden replied in the negative and was not disappointed. Eden also said that misrepresentation is a mistake. If the Disarmament Conference fails, not only will the security of the European countries be shaken, but the security of the United Kingdom will also be in danger. After the failure of the Disarmament Conference, the countries will inevitably be eager to reorganize their armaments, and the United Kingdom is even more so, because the United Kingdom has automatically disarmed a lot. He believed that even if the United Kingdom increased its armaments several times, it might not be able to guarantee the security of the United Kingdom alone. Why? Because the competition between armaments will ultimately be insecure. What is urgently needed is a convention based on the British proposal and the restoration of the full authority of the League of Nations, with all the major countries of Western Europe listed in it. The British government will give sympathetic consideration to the documents of the countries that respond to the British proposal, and have the confidence that the countries do not want the Disarmament Conference to break down. When Eden mentioned the Prussian Prime Minister Goering's statement that "the Prussian spirit will eventually dominate Germany's future," he frankly prepared to recognize the difference between a military country and a militaristic country. But he felt that from the perspective of the British people, Goering's words belonged more to the militaristic country than to the military country. (Applause from the audience)</p>
<p>After Eden finished speaking, the members of the House of Commons began to debate foreign affairs. Churchill spoke first, saying that if the government thought that Prime Minister MacDonald's plan could be accepted by the people, it would be deceiving itself. The great danger of today's foreign policy is that we demand that France weaken its armaments, and the organization of international troops under the League of Nations is impossible. However, the troops of various countries may be able to contact each other for special reasons and give the world security. Labour Party member Wilson said that Eden's intention was excellent, but in view of the ambitions of German adventurers, he felt that Eden's efforts were a little untimely. Liberal Party member Samuel said that the revival of German militarism has placed Europe in a terrible dilemma. Will Europe tacitly approve its development until a world catastrophe occurs, or will it not recognize its equal status and stop its development? (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Simon ended the debate, vaguely saying, "If the general convention on disarmament cannot be successful, then we should try to negotiate an air force agreement with the countries of Western Europe. However, the United Kingdom is forced to be in this situation, and we will never allow the negotiations to drag on for a long time and have no end. What is important now is to act quickly. If a better solution is finally hopeless, then we can only calculate for the United Kingdom based on the results that the situation can produce in order to quickly deal with the needs of the situation." Simon believes that the method of secretly reorganizing armaments is very harmful, so he also said that in his opinion, "a disarmament convention, even if incomplete, is a hundred times better than no convention at all." (14th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) After exchanging views on the diplomatic situation, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives submitted a resolution, which was passed by the whole body, with only one abstention. The content of this resolution is as follows: (1) It still supports the implementation of disarmament under international supervision, as in the past policy, but it must be carried out under organized security conditions; (2) It continues to oppose Germany's military build-up; (3) It extremely hopes to conclude a general disarmament convention. If a convention cannot be concluded, then a convention should be concluded with the goal of limiting armaments, so as to avoid countries competing in armaments again and endangering peace. (14th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news from responsible parties, France's reply to the British disarmament statement may be sent out at the end of next week. The wording of this reply is mainly to avoid closing the door to future solutions. It is reported that the general conditions contained in the letter of former Foreign Minister Barthou to the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference Henderson on February 10 will be recognized. France is eager to prevent the disarmament discussions from miscarrying and deeply hopes that this reply can facilitate the final agreement. However, France's minimum needs, namely security and effective management of armaments, still need to be understood by the United Kingdom. All future matters depend on this.

<p>Taking Advantage of the Opportunity of Disarmament Failure</p>
<h3>Russia Launches a Peace Offensive</h3>
<p>Will Propose a Universal Non-Aggression Pact</p>
<p>Promote Diplomatic Relations with France and Leave Japan in Isolation</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the contents of the Soviet Union's "peace offensive" plan after the failure of the disarmament negotiations disclosed in today's Daily Telegraph, the Daily Telegraph has always been known for its well-informed diplomatic news. According to the newspaper, the Soviet Union advocates the conclusion of a universal non-aggression pact, with a mutual assistance pact to sanction aggressors attached. As for the definition of aggression, it is still based on the Eight-Nation Pact signed in London last summer. The Soviet Union hopes that this will further isolate Japan, because Japan is unwilling to participate in such a pact. The Soviet Union also hopes to use this to promote diplomatic relations with France, because France can be expected to welcome the Soviet Union's proposal. As for the United Kingdom, it is unlikely to participate in this pact because of the provisions of restraint, so as not to increase its responsibilities. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Plan</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Aviation Agencies</h3>
<p>Eliminating Redundancy and Increasing Combat Effectiveness</p>
<p>Now is the Time to Reform the Air Force</p>
<p>Lin and White Decline Investigation Committee Positions</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources in official circles, President Roosevelt is currently planning a practical merger of government aviation agencies. The White House has confirmed this, stating that a new plan for aviation organization is currently being drafted. President Roosevelt believes that the U.S. Air Force agencies are too redundant, which is uneconomical and inefficient. Merging these redundant agencies into one would benefit the Army, Navy, and private aviation. It is said that General Mitchell may be the commander of this new organization. Mitchell has long been a proponent of merging the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The reason he left the military was due to his severe criticism of the Air Force's division. Senator Max Howe stated that without unified action, the United States would be unable to fight. Howe also cited the deaths encountered by the U.S. Air Force mail service to illustrate the current state of the U.S. Air Force. Howe's remarks are approximately as follows: "We all know that the outcome of future wars will be determined by the superiority of the Air Force. We also know that the United States must quickly prepare for aerial warfare. The unpreparedness of the United States is enough to invite foreign attacks. All countries in the world must know that the United States is prepared. Now is the time. I believe that both the Senate and the House of Representatives are ready for correct military legislation." Secretary of the Navy Swanson expressed opposition to the merger of the Navy Air Force with other air forces, believing that the nature of the Army Air Force and the Navy Air Force is completely different. The restoration of Air Force mail service is still pending, as the Chief of the Air Corps of the War Department, General Foulois, is currently conducting an investigation of airmail lines in the eastern half of the United States. Foulois will also inspect the equipment of the troops. Foulois declared that the order to restore airmail would not be issued until after his inspection is complete. Today, the Senate Post Office Committee invited Lindbergh, Chamberlain, Rickenbacker, and Brigadier General Mikel to a meeting to consult on various legislative opinions regarding returning airmail to private operation. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) The famous American aviator Lindbergh was recently appointed by the Secretary of War as a member of the Aviation Investigation Committee, but according to today's news, Lindbergh declined to serve, stating that in his view, it is inappropriate to use Army planes to transport mail, and it is unfair to commercially run airmail companies because the commercial contracts were revoked without proper review.

Consul General Morishima replied that this matter was a matter between "Manchukuo" and your country, and not something he was aware of, and refused. (15th Den-tsu Telegram)</p>

<h3>Explains Sino-Russian Situation</h3>
<p>Says Situation Has Not Reached Critical Point</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In today's House of Representatives session, Ryuuji Nagashima of the Seiyukai Party first raised questions about the proposal to reduce the Manchurian Incident reserve fund in this year's budget, and then questioned the relationship between Manchuria and Russia. Minister of the Army Lin responded as follows:</p>
<p>Judging solely from the current situation of the Manchurian-Russian border relationship, it seems that the Soviet Union has a tendency towards proactive actions, but this cannot be said to mean that the Soviet Union is preparing for an offensive, as there is no factual evidence to prove this.</p>
<p>Soviet personnel operating on the front lines of the Manchurian-Soviet border have either shot down Japanese planes or frequently appeared in Korean territory. Their transgressions should indeed be recognized as facts. However, the political and diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union have not yet reached a critical situation, so there is no cause for concern.</p>
<p>As for the Manchurian Incident expenses, they are funds used to maintain peace and order in Manchuria. If 10 million yen is not enough, additional budget will still be requested. (15th Rengo Telegram)</p>

<p>(2) Establish an Economic Research Bureau directly under the Cabinet to centralize the above-mentioned reports, and at the same time investigate domestic industries, study the comparison of new and old goods, and the potential for future conflicts.

<p>After Breakdown of Cotton Industry Negotiations</p>
<h3>Britain and Japan Both Advocate Caution</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to the Economic and Financial News Agency, the Lancashire cotton industry delegation met yesterday with Sir Wilson, representative of Trade Minister Runciman. The delegation is now preparing to submit a report to the government. The report will recommend several measures to be taken, but it is generally believed that these measures will not be too hasty. The British government does not advocate applying differential treatment to tariffs on Japanese goods or stipulating restrictions on the amount of Japanese goods imported. Increasing export taxes on Japanese goods would inevitably raise local prices in some British colonies, and the British government's aim is to revive the export trade of Lancashire cotton cloth. Adopting tariff policies would run counter to this aim. Japan, on the other hand, is also maintaining caution and does not want to fall into political and economic isolation. Therefore, it is expected that direct negotiations between Britain and Japan are still possible. It is reported that Trade Minister Runciman will soon meet with the Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom to discuss the matter. (15th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese textile negotiations will be a matter for diplomatic discussion between the British and Japanese governments.

Also, Hore-Belisha stated that the British representatives had submitted their report to the government yesterday afternoon. Since the negotiations were the result of discussions between the British and Japanese governments and have now failed, the government will still consider the matter, but it is not convenient to say more at this time.

<p>Japanese Budget Approved</p>
<h3>Movement to Overthrow Cabinet Intensifies Again</h3>
<p>Saito Decides to Visit Elder Statesman Saionji</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The budget for this emergency situation reached a huge sum of 2.112 billion yen and was declared established on the 14th. Therefore, the government is working hard to pass important bills so that both houses may not need to extend the session and can conclude it. It is especially important to focus all efforts on the House of Peers in order to promote this. However, as the deadline for the closing of the Diet is approaching, the behind-the-scenes machinations in the political world are gradually intensifying. It is difficult to be optimistic about the atmosphere inside the Diet and the movement to overthrow the cabinet outside the Diet. Therefore, the government has decided that after the closing of the Diet, Prime Minister Saito will visit Duke Saionji to state the handling of the future political situation and attempt to reorganize the cabinet in order to stabilize the political situation. However, judging from the objective situation, the lifespan of the Saito cabinet is quite questionable. (15th Japanese Union Telegram)</p>

<h3>Case of Simpson Expelled by Puppet State</h3>

A member of parliament asked Foreign Secretary Simon about Simpson's claim for compensation from the Manchurian authorities. The Foreign Secretary first described Simpson's journey from Harbin to Dalian and then said that the British government, at Simpson's request, is currently consulting with the British Ambassador to Beiping to study Simpson's claim. This matter involves complex legal issues, but the study is nearing completion. Simpson was the editor of an English newspaper in Harbin. "Manchukuo" accused him of publishing Soviet propaganda and ordered him to leave the country. Simpson took refuge in the British Consulate in Harbin, and his newspaper was closed down. Simpson later voluntarily left Harbin for Dalian. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Oil Well Fire Not Extinguished</h3>
<p>Oil Flows Down Mountain Like a Fiery Serpent</p>
<p>Engineers Try to Put Out Fire Without Success</p>
<p>Tangier Two years ago, French engineers drilled wells in the Zirfa Mountains near Tangier, French Morocco, to extract oil. Last week, oil gushed out, yielding about 600,000 gallons per hour. Unexpectedly, the oil that spewed out touched an electric wire, the wire broke, and a fire started. Thus, where the oil reached, the fire followed, resulting in a river of fire flowing down the mountain, covering a wide area. The villages at the foot of the mountain are in danger. Engineers are now planning to blast a section of the mountain in order to block the oil well.</p>
<p>Also, the fire in the Zirfa Mountains has not subsided. Although engineers used half a ton of gunpowder to bomb the hillside above the oil well in an attempt to block the well, it was ultimately ineffective. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The officers and sailors of the U.S. gunboat USS Rutherton have left the ship to go to the lifeboats today. The gunboat has been destroyed. The ship was originally tasked with suppressing pirates, but unexpectedly a fire broke out on board. Efforts to extinguish the fire were ineffective, and the fire spread to the powder magazine. The captain ordered everyone to leave the ship and board the lifeboats and sent out a distress signal. Soon, many ships arrived one after another. The British destroyers HMS Wishart, HMS White Fly, and the ship Tainan arrived first and rescued everyone in the lifeboats. Two lifeboats were lost due to fog, but fortunately they were found soon and arrived safely in Hong Kong. There were 15 officers, 125 sailors, and 30 marines. The cause of the fire was reportedly from the oil depot. In an instant, the flames lit up the sky and could be seen from several miles away. The hull was completely destroyed and soon sank. After arriving in Hong Kong, the officers of the U.S. warship praised the bravery of the officers of the British warship who rescued them at the scene. Currently, eight sailors from the Rutherton are in the hospital for treatment, but their injuries are not serious. (15th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yesterday, the U.S. warship USS Rutherton (1,100 tons) had an accident in Dapeng Bay. After everyone on the ship boarded the lifeboats at 10 a.m., they were rescued by the British destroyers HMS Wishart and Jinan (transliteration). At the time of the accident, there was a heavy fog, but fortunately everyone on the ship was rescued. Only three people were injured: one was burned by steam, one broke an arm, and one broke a leg. HMS Wishart arrived in Hong Kong at 2:40 a.m. this morning, carrying U.S. warship Captain McHenry and all the crew members. Today, a Reuters reporter interviewed Captain Fillon of the U.S. warship and heard about the accident. According to him, the fire started in the engine room at 6:35 p.m. yesterday. Everyone on the ship was having dinner at the time. So an alarm was sounded once. Later, the fire became fierce, so an alarm was sounded again, ordering all personnel to board the deck. A quarter of an hour later, the rear of the ship was separated from the front, and the radio was also damaged at that time. At that time, the ship Jinan arrived first and fired rockets to guide HMS Wishart. Captain Fillon praised the bravery of Captain Duterte of the British warship and said that because the British captain risked docking HMS Wishart near the U.S. warship, everyone was able to escape one by one. As for the personnel at the stern of the ship, they all jumped onto the wooden rafts released by the British warship. At the same time, the ship Jinan also rescued two small boats carrying sailors. After arriving in Hong Kong, the personnel of the U.S. warship mustered on the British warship HMS Campbelltown and then went ashore in formation. The officers were stationed on HMS Campbelltown and HMS Daoma. HMS Wishart is currently docked next to the U.S. warship, fearing that the fire cannot be extinguished within 24 hours. The ship's powder magazine was flooded at the time of the accident, so there is no risk of explosion. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>

It is estimated that the U.S. warship can be towed to Hong Kong this afternoon. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Control Yuan</p>
<h3>Impeachment of Yellow River Affairs Personnel</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Control Committee member Yang Rentian impeached Zhou Xiangxian, a member of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, and Sun Qingze, director of the Yellow River Affairs Bureau of Hebei, for neglecting their duties and harming the people. After review, it was generally believed that the government had allocated a large amount of money, appointed committee members, and established a special bureau, originally to be responsible for Yellow River disaster relief. The committee members and bureau director should have been prudent and careful in carrying out flood prevention and rescue work to mitigate disasters. However, in Changyuan County, Hebei, the breach at Shitouzhuan was not blocked, resulting in another tragic disaster. This was an extreme case of negligence and should be immediately transferred to the disciplinary committee to emphasize the importance of people's lives. The Control Yuan has transferred the case to the Central Public Disciplinary Committee for investigation and handling. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan sent a telegram to the governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces stating that, according to a telegram from Shao Hongji and Yu Hongqi, the lack of ships to transport materials and the resulting delays along the way were the biggest reasons for the delay in the construction of the Changyuan blockade project. During the spring floods, the water势 [shì - power/momentum] was raging, and the work of closing the gap was urgent. If relief measures were not taken quickly, the effects might be delayed, and the disaster situation might inevitably worsen. It was proposed to quickly telegraph the governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces to instruct the relevant county bureaus along the Yellow River from Gongxian to Zhengxian to find ways to recruit and send heavy-load ships to the Second Engineering Office for application, so as to avoid delaying important work, etc. Please investigate and comply as soon as possible.

<h3>Attempt to Counterattack Ends in Miserable Defeat</h3>
<p>Scattered and Fled Towards Taihewei and Kangdu</p>
<p>Ji'an and Le'an Communist Suppression Teams Telegraph Province to Report Victory</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, Nanfeng Report, Jiangxi East bandits, since being severely damaged by the National Army in the Lichuan Xiangfeng Xuangu'ao area, are eager for revenge. On the 4th of this month, the puppet 13th Division took advantage of the fact that Fan Wu's fortifications were not yet completed and launched a fierce counterattack against the positions of the 474th Regiment of the Third Route Army of the National Army. The puppet 38th Regiment restrained the supplementary regiment of the whole bamboo National Army, and the 37th and 39th Regiments attacked the left wing of the National Army at Guchenggang. The 9th Company of the 474th Regiment at Tongqianzhai immediately stopped working and calmly responded to the battle. The bandit forces were very stubborn. Fortunately, Zhang Xiting, the battalion commander of the 1st Battalion of the 474th Regiment, arrived with the 2nd and 3rd Companies, and the National Army's front line became more solid. The bandit forces repeatedly attacked the National Army's flank, but were all swept away by the National Army's machine guns and bombarded by mortars, coupled with the support of airplanes. The bandit puppet 37th Regiment suffered heavy casualties. At 4 p.m., the bandit puppet 39th Regiment continued to attack, and the 8th Company of the battalion quickly reinforced, and the supplementary regiment sent a battalion of troops to attack. By 7:30 p.m., the entire bandit puppet 13th Division had collapsed and scattered towards Taihewei and Kangdu. In this battle, the bandit forces suffered 700-800 casualties, more than 100 were captured, and dozens of guns were seized. The National Army suffered only 7 soldier casualties.</p>
<p>In addition, the Civil Affairs Department yesterday received reports from various counties on the situation of the Communist Suppression Volunteer Teams suppressing bandits: (1) Wen Huichou, magistrate of Ji'an County, reported that the Communist Suppression Volunteer Team of Tianhe, Ji'an County, advanced to suppress the puppet 8th District Guerrilla Team entrenched in Guoshui a few days ago. After contacting the bandits for about an hour, they killed more than ten bandits, seized three rifles, recruited five defectors, brought one rifle, and rescued more than 100 hostages. After the great victory, the Communist Suppression Volunteer Team took advantage of the victory and attacked the puppet village government and puppet short gun team puppet guerrilla team in Gaoche, Wutong, and Qingshi Township at dawn the next day. The bandit forces were unable to resist and fled towards Aocheng. Several bandits were captured on the spot, and many puppet seals and puppet propaganda materials were seized. (2) Zhang Xiangfu, magistrate of Le'an County, reported that more than 30 bandits were suddenly discovered in Xiqiliao, Xiangshanbei, Le'an County a few days ago.

The place was full of steep cliffs and freezing cold. Each team proceeded at risk, wrapping their feet in rags. They arrived at the location at 10:00 p.m., waving flags and shouting, with great power and prestige. After a fierce battle of about an hour and a half, they finally defeated the bandit forces and immediately set fire to destroy the bandit den. In this battle, four bandits were killed, six bandits were captured, four rifles and twenty bullets were seized, and the remaining military supplies were collected by the Special Operations Team.

<h3>Setting Off to Suppress Bandits in Northern Hubei</h3>
<p>To Convene a Meeting of Generals in Fancheng</p>
<p>Then Visit Guanghua, Yunxian, and Yunxian to Inspect Defense</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, Chairman Chiang, because the counties in northern Hubei border the three provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, and the mountains are overlapping and stretch for thousands of miles, when the bandits of Xu Xiangqian, Wu Huanxian, and Liu Guitang were defeated, he feared that they would flee into the area, rely on the mountains to hide themselves, leading to prolonged military operations and no rest for the people. He specifically telegraphed He Chengjun, the pacification envoy stationed in Hubei, to set off for Xiangfan to take responsibility for overseeing the suppression. After receiving the order, He set off from Wuhan on the 10th, but the trip was postponed due to rain. It was not until this (14th) morning that he took the Hubei East Highway and transferred to the Xianghua Highway north. The accompanying personnel included Guan Linshu, Chief of Staff; Yang Duo, Section Chief; Xu Xuzhong, Staff Officer; Guan Wenhui; Wen Zhenfan, Adjutant; Liu Shiying; Ying Hong, Quartermaster; Zhou Jisheng, Secretary; Liu Danqi, Liu Jiahu, and Zhang Mingzhai, Telegraphers; and a platoon of escorts. They are scheduled to pass through Hanchuan and Yunmeng in the morning and transfer to Anlu at noon. If there are no delays, they will go directly to Xiangyang via Suixian and Zhaoyang, and temporarily reside in Fancheng within days. He will also convene Fan Shisheng, Zhang Zhenhan, Luo Qijiang, and other generals in Fancheng for a consultation to decide on a new plan, and then visit Guanghua, Yunxian, and Yunxian to inspect. He's mission to the north includes six tasks: (1) Supervising the various armies to eliminate the remnants of bandits on the border between Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi; (2) Formulating a fundamental plan to prevent Xu's bandits; (2) Inspecting the bandit prevention bunkers in various counties; (4) Surveying the transportation on the borders of various provinces; (5) Examining the discipline of the various armies; (6) Inquiring about the sufferings of the people. After all, transportation in northern Hubei is blocked, the people are ignorant, and in military terms, it is an important town. It is necessary to make arrangements before the bandit tracks arrive. He said before leaving that he would set an entire plan for the scattered bandits in Xiangfan, order the garrison to search and suppress them, and set a time limit for elimination. Liu Guitang's remnant bandits were previously reported to have fled to Nanzhao and Nanyang. After failing to flee south, they have now fled east to the Pinghan Railway via Linying and are attempting to enter Shandong. The bandit has fled for thousands of miles and suffered heavy losses. There is little strength left, and it will not be difficult to wipe them out by encircling them. He will return to Hankou after inspecting northern Hubei, but the period cannot be predetermined. During He's departure period, the affairs of the Pacification Office will be handled by Yang Kuiyi, Chief of Staff; Zhu Chuanjing, Chief Advisor; and Chen Guangzu, Director of the Office, respectively. Important official affairs will be reported to the superiors for approval at any time. (March 14)</p>

<h3>Paper Currency Redemption Process</h3>
<p>Gong Yu Has Redeemed Eight-Tenths</p>
<p>County Government Auctions the Property of Four Money Shops</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Xubu paper currency surge that stirred up a wave before the New Year, during County Magistrate She's tenure, had required the Gong Yu Bank, jointly formed by merchants, to fully redeem. At that time, Gong Yu shareholders raised funds to issue small denomination notes for redemption, but ultimately, it was difficult to raise cash, and redemption was soon suspended. Since Wang Gongyu took over as County Magistrate, he has been striving for a thorough clean-up, taking responsibility on his behalf, and borrowing 30,000 yuan for Gong Yu from the banking community, 20,000 yuan for Bu Xinji, and 10,000 yuan for Yi Zhenxiang. As a result, these three families opened for redemption before the New Year. However, Chunquan, Tian Baoyu, Shixingchang, and Juhechang, four families, were unable to mortgage due to a lack of credit guarantees. They are currently engaged in auctioning off the property of these four families for an initial redemption at a discount. To date, seven banks have been able to enter the path of a complete resolution, and private banknotes can be expected to disappear from this point on. The handling of the redemption process is recorded below.</p>
<p>The Redemption Process of Three Banks: Gong Yu Bank was jointly formed by large and small shops in this port, Bu Xinji was a large grocery store on Daoping Road in the South Gate, and Yi Zhenxiang was a wine and oil workshop on Zhongzheng Street in the East Station. Gong Yu had large merchants among its shareholders responsible, while Bu Xinji and Yi Zhenxiang, in addition to all their industries, also had their relatives and friends privately participating in the responsibility. This is why they were able to gain the trust of the bank, and with the County Government using administrative power to sign a guarantee contract, they respectively borrowed cash and opened for unlimited redemption before and after the end of the lunar year. The slight easing of the market at the end of the lunar year was entirely dependent on this. Gong Yu was 30,000 yuan, Bu Xinji 20,000 yuan, and Yi Zhenxiang 10,000 yuan. To date, about eight-tenths have been redeemed. When redemption first opened, large amounts were redeemed every day. After the New Year, they were as rare as morning stars. Currently, merchants and residents in the city have no notes from these three families. Even farmers in the countryside, or those further away from Xuzhou, are unlikely to hold many notes. Based on this speculation, this 60,000 yuan in cash is sufficient to cover the total amount needed to clear the three families. Gong Yu reported that the amount of notes was 140,000 yuan. When shareholders raised funds to issue small denomination notes for redemption, some had already been recovered. During the initial run, daily limited redemption also recovered some. Bu Xinji and Yi Zhenxiang issued fewer notes to begin with, and the limited redemption during the initial economic redemption also recovered a lot. In the past two months, those who had creditor relationships with the note issuers have also purchased paper notes at a discount to repay debts. In addition, the paper notes outside were inevitably lost and damaged, so a small amount of funds can achieve the effect of clearing. Currently, the three families are still continuing to redeem, and no problems are expected to occur in the future.</p>
<p>Auctioning the Property of Four Banks: Chunquan, Tian Baoyu, Juhechang, and Shixingchang, four families, were rejected by the bank due to a lack of credit guarantees, and the County Government could not take responsibility on their behalf. The County Government had ordered the owners of the four families to quickly find their own solutions, but the County Government remained in a position of assistance. However, since the four families have not been able to devise a plan to date, the County Government believes that further delays are unacceptable and plans to auction off their property. However, in terms of valuation, the difference is too great. It is also planned that after the auction, the cash obtained will be redeemed at a discount according to the proportion of the total amount. However, this type of debt is different from ordinary debt and cannot be settled at a bankruptcy discount. Therefore, it is planned that when redeeming at a discount, a seal will be added to the original note, which will still be kept by the note holder, and when the note owner has continued financial resources, a full redemption will be made, not only so that the public will not suffer losses, but also to prevent the occurrence of private banknotes in the future. The County Government has issued a notice to clear the property of the four families, which states: "It has been found that the notes of Tian Baoyu, Chunquan, Shixingchang, Juhechang, and other four families have been unresolved for a long time, which has greatly affected the interests of the public. This government has repeatedly ordered the note holders of the four families to quickly raise funds for redemption, but they have not complied. In order to seek a quick solution, the property of the four families will be actively cleared and prepared for sale for redemption. Anyone who has information about the property of the four families, in addition to those that have been sealed and registered by this government, or those who have hidden or failed to report, are now allowed to report within two weeks so that this problem can be resolved as soon as possible. Let all sectors of the public know." As for the property of the four families that has been sealed and registered, Chunquan has 12 qing of farmland in Yuzhuang in the seventh district, and 8 qing of land on Gushan in Xiaojing. Tian Baoyu has 217 mu of farmland in Wangdian in the fifth district, 35 mu of farmland at Broken Bridge in the fifth district, 100 mu of land west of Shijiazhuang in the first district, a house on the old Daoshu Street, a house south of the electric light factory, and two mu of the Hongmiao city base. Shixingchang has 300 mu of farmland in Xiaohuangjia in the fifth district, 335 mu of official farmland, two houses in Zhou Dongxiang, a market house on Sidao Street, (Guang Chunquan pawned) half of a pit house, (Wanhua Yong pawned) a house on Fushu Street, (Hongxing Yong pawned) Suhechang has 50 mu of farmland in Yanjiashan in the seventh and eighth districts, 50 mu of Daliao land, 150 mu of Wangjiashan land, and a house in Mahao Town.

<h3>Building a Hall and Lending Funds to Repair Dikes</h3>
<p>Allocating 200,000 of Sheyu Road Public Bonds</p>
<p>Raising Cash to Lend to Various Counties for Application</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The main dikes of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers in Anhui Province were previously commissioned by the Construction Department to send a large number of supervisors to various sections to recruit workers for construction. However, the construction costs were enormous, and the National Economic Council delegated the task to Anhui Province to raise funds on its own. However, Anhui Province's treasury was in dire straits, and it was not easy to raise funds quickly. Now, in order to assist in the construction of the main dikes of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, and to repair the breaches of the inner dikes connecting the main dikes, the Construction Department has allocated 200,000 yuan of Sheyu Road public bonds, raised cash, and lent it to various counties for application. After careful investigation of the actual situation of various counties along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, and the local economic conditions and tax revenue ratios, Huaining and 19 other counties were ordered to subscribe for sales separately, with the largest amount being 20,000 yuan and the smallest only 2,000 yuan. The provincial government has been presented with orders for the counties to pay the amount in installments, and a method for lending funds for dike repair has been drafted, designating the dike repair counties as Huaining, Tongcheng, Wuwei, Hexian, Dangtu, Wuhu, Fanchang, Tongling, Guichi, Dongliu Susong, Wangjiang, Fuyang, Yingshang, Huoqiu, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Lingbi, Fengyang, and Wuhe, a total of 20 counties. The amount of the loan is allocated by the Construction Department according to the needs of the projects in each place, and distributed by the county magistrates of each county in conjunction with the supervisory committee to distribute the loans to each embankment or small section, and an examination committee is organized to submit it for examination and approval. The loan is charged at 8% interest per annum. Starting from the Republic of China year 24, the principal and interest will be repaid once every three and nine months, with the interest decreasing along with the principal. The principal and interest will be publicly shared by each county in the benefited fields according to the amount borrowed by each embankment section, divided into six installments, and paid to the county for collection on schedule until the loan is repaid in full. The Loan for Dike Repair Examination Committee is composed of seven members, with one person each from the Provincial Government Secretariat, the three departments of civil affairs, finance, and construction, and the Water Conservancy Engineering Office, and two members of the Provincial Disaster Relief Committee are invited to form the committee. The committee is attached to the Construction Department for convenience and cost savings. (March 14)</p>

<h3>Bandits Rob and Kidnap</h3>
<p>Qian Zhaokun, a villager in Zhujing outside the East Gate, is said to be well-off, which has been coveted by bandits. In October of last year, Qian received a letter from bandits demanding a large sum of money. Qian ignored it. At 3:00 AM on the 14th, more than ten bandits suddenly broke down the door, speaking with mixed accents and holding wooden sticks. They immediately searched for silver dollars, but were not satisfied. They then kidnapped Qian's daughter-in-law, Ms. Fang. At this time, County Magistrate Peng Baichuan learned of this and immediately ordered Inspector Wang Shuren of the Public Security Bureau to lead police captain Luo Qixiang and police to rush to pursue the bandits. The bandits had already fled far away. They immediately returned to Kunshan to report. The escaped bandits are now being strictly pursued, and the hostage is being rescued.</p>

<h3>Execution of Robber by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>On the night of November 24th last year, at about 8:00 PM, Wang Weishen's home, a farmer in Huchuan Township, District 1, was robbed, and the victims, Wang Weishen and others, were burned with candles. Later, the Kunshan County Defense Corps intercepted Zhang Ronggui and seven others. The county government of this county welcomed them back to Taicang and interrogated them repeatedly. Zhang Ronggui confessed to jointly robbing and injuring people and obtaining stolen goods. According to the victim's clear identification in court, he was sentenced to death according to law and reported to the provincial government. On the morning of the 14th, the prisoner Zhang Ronggui was signed and escorted, his identity was verified, and he was tied to the execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>

<h3>Robbery and Injury in Qijian Village</h3>
<p>Zhang Shuhua, of Qijian Village in District 7 of the county, is a small business owner, and the bandits are coveting him. He was previously kidnapped and lost thousands of dollars before he escaped danger. He then moved to the city to avoid danger, and several years have passed. Last year, in order to save expenses, he moved back home. Unexpectedly, dozens of bandits suddenly came to his home and broke down the door on the evening of the other day. They forbade him from making any noise and searched arbitrarily. At that time, Shuhua was unable to escape and was beaten by the bandits with fists and feet, causing serious injuries. It is estimated that clothing and other items worth hundreds of dollars were robbed. The three neighboring families of Zhang Zeshu, Zhang Hanming, and Zhang Xingsheng also suffered similar robberies.</p>

<h3>County Education Directors Gather in Suzhou for Discussion</h3>
<p>The education directors of various counties in Jiangsu Province, in view of the fact that the Department of Education intends to propose 20% of the education funds and various special education funds of each county as the general reserve fund of each county, if implemented, will have a great impact on the future of education in each county. Therefore, it was decided to gather at the Wuxian Education Bureau on the 24th of this month to discuss all matters.</p>

<h3>Major Water Robbery: Police and Bandits in Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>Recently, the atmosphere in the four townships has been uneasy, and news of robbery has been frequent. On the afternoon of the previous day (14th) at about 5:00 PM, five ships from this county to Qingyang Nan Zha Jin Tong Bridge and Changzhou Henglin jointly departed from Wuxi. At about 7:00 PM, as dusk fell, they approached Gaokou. Suddenly, more than ten burly men on the shore, holding guns and flashlights and speaking with mixed northern accents, opened fire and ordered the ships to stop. The five ships, seeing the situation was not good, immediately stopped. At that time, Patrol Leader Liu Yulin, who was stationed on the ship, led the police to protect the ship. Upon hearing the alarm, he remained calm and silently directed the police to crawl ashore in the dim light. At his command, they raised their guns and returned fire. The bandits also opened fire. The two sides fought fiercely for about ten minutes. At the same time, the Qianqiao Defense Corps also heard the alarm and arrived to assist in the battle. In the end, the bandits were overwhelmed and retreated backwards. Patrol Leader Liu immediately ordered the entire team of police officers to surround and pursue the bandits. The bandits fled in all directions. Two bandits jumped into the river and were chased into the water by the police and captured. Another bandit was also captured. The guns carried by the bandits were thrown into the river. The remaining bandits all escaped. Patrol Leader Liu then ordered the police to tie up the three captured bandits and escort them to the Water Patrol Detachment, and then transfer them to the county government for legal action. It is said that one bandit was killed in the police-bandit battle and his body fell into the river, but this has not been confirmed. In addition, on the afternoon of yesterday at about 6:00 PM, a Su Xi ship, which had departed from Wuxi and was heading to the Xiadian Bridge near Mianzhangjiang Bridge, was suddenly met by a fishing boat, and three bandits jumped out, each holding a handgun, a pudao, and other weapons, and boarded the ship to search. At that time, there were two water police officers from the first squad of the ninth team of the second district of the water police on board, carrying weapons to protect the ship. Upon hearing the alarm, they attempted to resist, but because there were more bandits, they were instead robbed of a gun and 38 rounds of ammunition. The silver dollars and goods on board were also looted, resulting in significant losses. In addition, a Xi Chang ship was also robbed under the Suokou Bridge at about 8:00 PM the previous night, with losses of over 100 yuan. Now, the shipping industry, seeing the danger on the water, has jointly petitioned the county government to request protection for navigation and to strictly pursue the stolen goods.</p>

<h3>Current Status of the Zhencheng Road Project</h3>
<p>Since the provincial government ordered the Zhencheng Road to be paved, all counties along the line have started construction. Cheng County has completed eight or nine tenths of the project. The National Economic Council specially appointed Xu Xingfang to conduct an inspection along the road with Wu Tingzuo, the director of the engineering office. Only one-half of the first section of Zhenjiang has been completed, and the remaining sections have only been completed by three or four tenths. The Danyang section has only been slightly paved last year, and has not yet started construction this year. The Wujin section also has poor results. The Jiangyin section is the best, and the entire road has been completed by eight or nine tenths. After completing the inspection, the Xu Committee and others went to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Change of Prison Staff</h3>
<p>Huang Ruyuan, the county government's prison warden and director of the detention center, has previously served in the Jiangsu Fourth and Second Sub-Prisons and has rich experience. After taking office last month, he found that the number of prisoners in the county's prison was large, overcrowded, and had deep-seated problems that were difficult to reform. He immediately requested resignation from the High Court and was approved by order. Liu Fu was appointed as the successor, and Liu took over on the 10th.</p>

<h3>County Government Executes Bandit Leader in Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>On January 6th of this year, at 8:00 PM, Wu Jinquan's home, a resident of Shijiatang, Yongning Township, District 16 of Wu County, was suddenly entered by bandits who searched the room and kidnapped Wu's son, Yuan Sheng, and hid him in the home of a bandit in Liuyi Township, demanding a large sum of money for ransom. Later, Wu Yuansheng took the opportunity to escape home. The police regiment of the district, along with informants, went to the bandit's lair to search and arrested many bandits, including Zong Koulin, who was confirmed to be the ringleader in the case. The county government sentenced him to death and reported to the provincial government for approval. On the afternoon of the 14th, the police were dispatched to sign and escort the prisoner to the case, verify his identity, tie him to the Fengweidun execution ground, and execute him by firing squad.</p>

<h3>Adding a Bus Station at Wangwu Bridge</h3>
<p>The bus station on the Jiaxing-Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway is located at Chemen, but the prosperous commercial market of Jiaxing is in Beimen. Passengers who come to Jiaxing by bus have to get off at the station and then go to Beimen, which is time-consuming and uneconomical. Therefore, merchants and residents in the Shuangqiao area have jointly petitioned the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction to set up a bus branch station at Wangwu Bridge in Beimen to facilitate travel. The Jiangsu Construction Department ordered the Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway Administration to investigate. It has now been decided to approve the addition of a branch station. The station address is in the Yilifeng Hotel west of Wangwu Bridge, and Mr. Xu has been appointed as the manager. Ticket sales will begin on March 16th.</p>

<h3>Jardine Matheson's Yisheng Ship Robbed by Pirates</h3>
<p>Robbery Along the Fujian-Guangdong Coast Lasts More Than 30 Hours</p>
<p>Ten Passengers Kidnapped, Losses of Passengers and Goods Unknown</p>
<p>The Company Received a Telegram Yesterday Stating That the Ship Had Arrived in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson's Nanhua liner Yisheng, which was chartered from a Norwegian company in Hong Kong, was originally named Norviken. After being chartered by Jardine Matheson, it was renamed Yisheng and operated on the Nanhua route, also calling at Qingdao. On the 11th of this month, it left Shanghai fully loaded with yarn, cloth, flour, rice, groceries, etc., totaling more than 20,000 pieces, as well as 11,000 pieces of soybean cake bound for Shantou, and a number of passengers, departing Shanghai at noon.</p>
<h3>Pirates Disembark in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Before the ship weighed anchor in Shanghai, a group of pirates, disguised as passengers, boarded the vessel. Yesterday, the company received a telegram stating that there were twenty-two pirates in total. On Tuesday (the 13th) at approximately 6 a.m., as the ship approached the waters off Fuzhou, the pirates emerged, each wielding firearms. Several pirates stormed the bridge and the radio room, driving the crew into one room under guard. After cutting the radio antenna and throwing it into the sea, they began their looting spree, sparing neither crew nor passengers. They also opened the cargo holds and seized goods. Two other pirates, on the bridge, forced the captain to steer the ship towards the</p>
<p>northern part of Dapeng Bay, to a place called (Chlang) (transliteration). By 3 p.m. on Wednesday, the 14th, they reached their destination. The pirates had pre-arranged everything, so as soon as the ship arrived, a pirate ship approached and the stolen goods were unloaded onto it.</p>
<h3>Ten Passengers Kidnapped</h3>
<p>In total, the pirates' plundering lasted from 6 a.m. on the 13th to 3 p.m. on the 14th, spanning over thirty hours. As they were about to leave, dissatisfied with their loot, they kidnapped ten passengers. The names of those kidnapped and the value of the stolen goods are currently under investigation, hence the telegram did not provide further details.</p>
<h3>Request for Search and Suppression After the Incident</h3>
<p>After the pirates left, the captain bypassed Shantou and sailed directly to Hong Kong. He arrived in Hong Kong yesterday and reported the hijacking to the head office. The head office immediately telegraphed Shanghai and also telegraphed British warships along the coast and our national authorities, requesting them to dispatch ships to search and suppress the pirates and rescue the kidnapped passengers.</p>
<p>Flying Club</p>
<h3>Preparatory Office to be Established</h3>
<p>Formal Establishment Pending Central Approval</p>
<p>Representatives from Military, Political, and Other Sectors Scheduled to</p>
<p>Confer This Afternoon on Venue Arrangements for the Tianchu Aircraft Naming Ceremony</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of the Flying Club and the Tianchu aircraft naming ceremony, Mr. Lin Wo-jiang, Secretary-General of the Chinese Aviation Association, stated yesterday that the organizational outline of the Flying Club had been drafted. However, as this type of organization is a new endeavor in our country, all plans require careful consideration. A special telegram has been sent to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions. Once central approval is obtained, the formal establishment can proceed. To facilitate progress, it is planned to establish a preparatory office around the 18th of this month. The Tianchu aircraft naming ceremony is scheduled to take place on the 18th at the Hongqiao Airfield. The government has dispatched Xu Pei-gen, Director of the Aviation Administration, as its representative to Shanghai to accept the aircraft. The Executive Yuan will send Mr. Chu Minyi as its representative to attend. The order of the ceremony will be: first, the Tianchu aircraft naming ceremony; second, the presentation of the Sun Tonggang aircraft by Du Yuesheng; and third, the acceptance of the secondary title for the Tianchu aircraft and the presentation of the aircraft by Sun Tonggang by the Aviation Association. Regarding venue arrangements, security, and traffic control, the Aviation Association's office will convene a meeting this afternoon at 4 p.m. at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, inviting representatives from the Municipal Government, Public Security Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Security Department, and Tianchu Factory to discuss all matters. A dispatch from Nanjing states that Sun Tonggang will travel to Shanghai on the evening of the 15th to accept the "Pengcheng Wanli" aircraft donated by Du Yuesheng. He is scheduled to depart from Shanghai by that aircraft on the morning of the 19th to fly to Beijing. After a one-day stopover, he will fly back to his hometown in Shandong on the original aircraft. At the end of the month, he will fly from Shandong to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions, and he plans to go abroad in early June.</p>

<h3>Hawke to Depart for Guangzhou This Morning</h3>
<p>Giant Bomber Being Transported to Hangzhou by Waterway</p>
<p>After One Month of Assembly and Testing, Will Return to Shanghai for Performance</p>
<p>American aviator Mr. Hawke, after bringing the Condor giant bomber to Shanghai, once went to Hangzhou for inspection and returned to Shanghai the night before last. He will take the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight to Guangzhou this morning around 7 a.m. As for the Condor aircraft, due to the difficulty in railway transportation, it will be transported to Hangzhou by waterway on Sunday. The assembly and testing will take a considerable amount of time. According to a representative of Curtiss-Wright Corporation to the New Voice News Agency, it will take thirty days to complete and then return to Shanghai for performance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Flying to Guangzhou This Morning　After arriving in Shanghai, Hawke went to Hangzhou with Mr. Paul, the Shanghai representative of Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Company, for inspection some days ago. He returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou the night before last. According to Paul to the New Voice News Agency yesterday, the two of them will take the CNAC Shanghai-Guangzhou southbound flight to Guangzhou from Longhua at 7 a.m. this morning and will return to Shanghai in about a week. Pilot Coles will not be traveling with them.</p>
<p>Land Transportation Obstacles　The Condor aircraft is very large. Paul and Hawke originally intended to transport the aircraft to Hangzhou for assembly and testing, because the Hangzhou airfield has a larger space for placing the aircraft. However, the bridges and steel frames on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway are narrower, and the aircraft could not pass on a train. As a result, problems arose. They then wanted to transport the aircraft to the Hongqiao Airfield for installation, but the bridges near Nanyang University on the way can only accommodate objects weighing five tons, while the minimum weight of the Condor aircraft is eleven tons. Therefore, that was also impossible. It was also suggested to transport the aircraft to the Longhua Airfield, and there were no problems with transportation, but the hangar at that airfield, after the Condor aircraft was installed, could not be moved out due to the increased size of the fuselage. Therefore, neither location was suitable for assembly and testing.</p>
<p>Water Transport to Hangzhou　It is now known that the aircraft has been handed over to a transportation company for shipment. According to Paul to the New Voice News Agency, it has now been decided to transport the aircraft to Hangzhou by waterway on Sunday (the day after tomorrow) for assembly and testing, which will take a total of thirty days to complete and then return to Shanghai for performance.</p>

<p>Adopting the Gold Standard is Ideal but Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>China Cannot Prohibit Silver Exports Due to its Trade Deficit</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that the United States' implementation of raising silver prices has gradually affected the commerce of silver-using countries around the world. China, as one of the silver-using countries, is no exception. As for the countermeasures to be taken, it was rumored among foreigners in Shanghai yesterday that China was advocating taking this opportunity to adopt the gold standard. However, according to the New Voice News Agency's inquiries from various parties, the government has no such intention. It may be the opinion of private parties. It would certainly be a good strategy to cope with rising silver prices, but it is difficult to achieve in reality. Banks in Shanghai generally believe that the only solution is to increase the silver export tax and that prohibition of exports is not possible. It is said that the total amount of silver in China is only 150 million, and foreign merchants hold two-thirds of the total, which is alarming. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Difficult to Change Standard</h3>
<p>Yesterday, news circulated among foreign banks in Shanghai that, in order to deal with the United States' increase in silver prices, China is now considering taking this opportunity to implement the gold standard in accordance with Kemal's gold standard plan report, so that Chinese native products will not be affected by the increase in silver prices. From the perspective of gold-using countries, increasing silver prices means increasing commodity prices. If China switches to the gold standard, then the prices of Chinese goods will also increase with the silver price. However, according to the New Voice News Agency's inquiries from domestic banks, the government currently has no such intention, believing that this proposal may be the opinion of private parties and stating that this proposal cannot be said to be bad, but it is difficult to implement in practice. China lacks the raw materials to switch to the gold standard, which is the biggest difficulty, and it is more costly, which cannot be done in China's current period of economic crisis. Therefore, Dr. Kemal's report cost the Ministry of Finance more than one million in expenses and can only be regarded as reference material to this day.</p>
<h3>Only Taxation Can Cope</h3>
<p>Since it is difficult to switch to the gold standard, the only way to cope with rising silver prices is to increase the corresponding silver export tax to restrict it. Leading figures in the Shanghai banking industry, such as Bei Songsun, Xu Jiqing, Zhang Gongquan, Li Fusun, Xu Xinliu, and Lin Kanghou, all agree with this proposal. However, the increase in the silver export tax must be based on the extent to which the United States raises silver prices. For example, if the current difference between the silver price raised by the United States and the Chinese silver price is 5 percent, then China's export tax should also be increased by 5 percent from the original 2.5 percent export tax to balance it. However, if silver prices fall, the export tax must also be reduced to restrict it.</p>
<h3>Cannot Prohibit Silver Exports</h3>
<p>The banking community also believes that it is impossible to prohibit silver exports. Prohibiting silver exports would cause panic in society, so this matter is absolutely impossible. China has a large trade deficit, averaging 700 million per year. If silver exports are prohibited, then this 700 million trade deficit, which is the foreign goods purchased by Chinese merchants, will not be paid. Moreover, the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar will become more expensive, and the price of silver in China will fall, which will cause great panic. Private smugglers of silver will also have huge profits to be made. At that time, it may be impossible to prohibit smuggling, and the outflow of silver may still occur naturally. Therefore, the banking community also believes that this proposal is impossible.</p>
<h3>Alarming Silver Deposits Held by Foreign Merchants</h3>
<p>According to people in the banking industry yesterday, the total amount of silver in Shanghai, including Chinese and foreign banks and money shops, is 150 million taels, and the silver held by foreign banks, such as HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, accounts for two-thirds of the total, which is 100 million taels. The remaining 50 million is owned by Chinese merchants, of which the money shops account for only 5 million. Chinese merchants can be assured, but silver held by foreign banks may inevitably flow out. When reporters inquired about this news yesterday, they heard that the total amount of silver in Shanghai was 150 million taels. Subsequently, according to other leading figures in the banking industry, the 150 million silver deposits are actually the total amount of silver collected in Shanghai by banks across the country.</p>
<h3>Minting is Also a Good Strategy</h3>
<p>In addition, the banking community believes that using silver to mint silver coins to counteract the outflow of silver is also a good strategy. If the minted silver coins are melted down again for silver and transported for export, it would be too uneconomical. Therefore, after silver is minted into silver coins, it should not flow out. However, the mint currently only mints more than 200,000 coins per day, which is a drop in the bucket and is of little help.</p>
<p>Foreign Pilotage Rights</p>
<h3>No Treaty Stipulations</h3>
<p>Chinese Pilots Association Issues Statement</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that recently, there have been rumors that the Shanghai Consular Corps, due to the Chinese government's proposal to recover the entire pilotage sovereignty, considered the issue to be significant and convened a meeting to discuss it. The consular corps believes that pilotage sovereignty is part of inland navigation rights and that it is difficult to resolve the pilotage rights issue before the inland navigation rights issue is resolved. It is said that the consuls have already requested instructions from their home countries. Now, according to a statement issued by the Chinese Pilots Association, the pilotage sovereignty of our country is completely different from inland navigation rights and is two separate matters. The only basis for foreigners to be pilots is the pilotage regulations approved by the General Customs Commissioner Robert Hart to the Prime Minister's Office during the seventh year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty. The largest and most important Shanghai South Entrance Pilotage Company, which is now occupied by foreigners, is also organized based on the above regulations. Not only does the association have the company's articles of association, but the government also has records. It is now a forced and groundless association. Since foreigners have been pilots in our country, they have aided the enemy and funded the enemy, such as in the battles of Tanggu, Mawei, and January 28, and the damage has been unbearable. Therefore, we are determined to recover it in order to protect ourselves. Moreover, what was approved in the seventh year of Tongzhi was not a treaty, but a government order on internal affairs. Now, changing the previous order with a later order will not be subject to any foreign interference. Therefore, our reasons are very sufficient, and the other party has no way to deal with it, so it involves unrelated matters in an attempt to expand the dispute in order to restrain it. The ignorant are spreading this news in order to shift the psychology of the people of the country, which is regrettable. According to the association's observation, all meetings are just superficial. The National Government issued the pilotage regulations in September last year. If each country had reasons to object, why did the problem not arise until today? It is hoped that the people of the country will pay attention to this in the future, such as the claim made by foreigners</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Denies Slander by Japanese Newspaper</h3>
<p>Telegram to Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that the Japanese newspaper "Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun" has slanderous reports on Sichuan affairs. Liu Xiang, Commissioner of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, telegraphed Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek on the 13th of this month. The original telegram is disclosed on the right (brief): "Secret, recent telegram to Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei: 'According to a telegram from the staff stationed in Shanghai yesterday, the Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun's report on Sichuan affairs is extremely slanderous, especially against Xiang. It says that he harbors ambitions, eliminates dissidents, or has other conspiracies that are detrimental to the central government. It even says that Xiang is colluding with Britain and France to build a railway to connect to Pianma. All kinds of rumors are unfounded. Xiang is ordered to suppress bandits and plan for rehabilitation. He is grateful for the support of your honor, wants to save the people of Sichuan from misery, his ability is small and his responsibility is heavy, and he is always afraid of failing. Seeing the devastation and displacement of the local people, he feels restless. He can only work hard to suppress and stabilize the country in order to repay your kindness. He knows nothing else. As for the schemes of manipulation and exclusion, Xiang despises and hates them the most. The national power is declining to the extreme. Joint efforts to save the country are still feared to be insufficient. The hardships are beyond the understanding of outside newspapers. As for the development and construction, Xiang is determined to do so. He has hired specialists to investigate local resources as preparation for future development and the elimination of bandits and the reduction of troops. This is the responsibility of rehabilitation. There is no conspiracy and no need to collude with foreigners. The Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun is run by the Japanese, and its wanton slander has other intentions. The foreign newspapers and a certain news agency in Shanghai have echoed and spread the rumors. I am afraid that many people will believe the lies and not be able to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Xiang briefly describes the situation and hopes for your understanding. Sincerely, Liu Xiang.' The former."</p>
<p>Saying that pilotage is related to treaties is just a smokescreen. (The following omitted)</p>

Since preparations began, all items have been completed and the grand opening is scheduled for 10 a.m. on March 21st. The participation of manufacturers is very enthusiastic. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Participating Manufacturers</h3>

<p>Yellow River Relief Committee Disaster Relief Group</p>
<h3>Scheduled to End This Month</h3>
<p>All Funds Transferred to Public Works Relief</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that regarding the Disaster Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, yesterday morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Xi De-jiong, director of the group, at the committee. According to him, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, chairman of the committee, has ordered the group by telegram to temporarily end at the end of March due to financial difficulties, so that all funds can be used for public works relief. The current state of disaster relief is recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Relief Agencies Temporarily Closed</h3>
<p>According to Xi, after the establishment of the Disaster Relief Group, investigation and distribution bureaus were established in the disaster areas of Shandong, Hebei, and Henan provinces, and personnel were dispatched to various disaster areas to provide relief. Many refugees were rescued, and the amount of money used to date has reached more than one million yuan. Mr. Kong Xiangxi, chairman of the committee, decided to temporarily suspend the work of the Disaster Relief Group at the end of March because public works relief in the three provinces had not yet been completed, and it would be more effective to send personnel to provide relief after the completion of the works, and because the committee's finances were in difficulty, so that all the committee's funds could be used for public works relief. After the breaches of the Yellow River in the three provinces have been completely blocked and completed, the situation will be reviewed in order to provide relief. After receiving the order, the group notified the relief agencies set up in the three provinces, such as refugee reception centers, porridge factories, and investigation and distribution bureaus, to close down in stages within the time limit.</p>
<h3>Refugees on the North Bank of the Yellow River Awaiting Rescue</h3>
<p>Xi continued that although the disaster situation in the three provinces has gradually improved compared to the past, there are still many refugees awaiting rescue. The disaster area on the south bank of the Yellow River was less affected, and the breach was blocked long ago, so there is no problem. However, the refugees on the north bank are still in dire straits. Those in urgent need of relief are the nine counties of Puyang and Dongchang in Shandong, Changyuan in Hebei, and Hua County and Yanjin in Henan. The situation is still extremely tragic, because the area of the breach on the north bank is large. Therefore, the solution to the disaster should be to block the breach first so that the Yellow River can return to its old course. It is heard that the Public Works Relief Group has already started blocking the breach and aims to complete it in the short term.</p>
<h3>Transferring Refugees to the Northwest for Reclamation</h3>
<p>Since the disaster in the three provinces, the local elites have been almost completely lost. The Yellow River Disaster Committee has decided to send the refugees awaiting rescue in the area to various places. After this plan to transfer refugees is decided, it will be coordinated with the provinces to which they are sent. An agreement has been reached with the Ministry of Railways regarding the free transfer of refugees. It is very good to transfer the homeless refugees to the northwest for reclamation and it is hoped that it can be done. It is also known that Xi plans to visit Kong in Beijing after Kong returns to Beijing from Jiangxi to present everything in person because the Disaster Relief Group is about to end.</p>

<h3>Achievements of Shanghai Factory National Goods in Hankou</h3>
<p>Rushing to Transport Two Batches of Goods to Hankou</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Promotion of National Products Association, at the invitation of Mayor Wu of Hankou, led the Shanghai National Products Traveling Delegation, and united with more than 120 well-known national products manufacturers in Shanghai, to participate in the Hankou Municipal National Products Mobile Exhibition. It is heard that all representatives of the delegation and factory staff arrived in Hankou at 7 a.m. on the 9th, and were welcomed by representatives from all walks of life in Hankou to Xinhua Company for a rest. They immediately responded to the public banquets of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various groups, and were very busy with the banquets in recent days. The venue was arranged by the political and business associations, and the order was well-organized. The Shanghai factories occupied 108 rooms on the first and second floors, and the Hankou factories occupied 50 rooms on the third floor. The exquisite national goods were gathered together, with colorful and dazzling brilliance. At noon on the 10th, Mayor Wu hosted a banquet for the manufacturers and held a welcome meeting. There was a lot of toasting and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves. During the meeting, the mayor gave a grand speech, saying that promoting national products can not only block the leaks, but also enrich the country and strengthen the people. It is the only great plan to save the country at present, and asked everyone to work hard to do it. At 2 p.m. on the 11th, the opening ceremony was held. In the melodious sound of military music, Mayor Wu's wife unveiled the curtain. Local military and political leaders were present to deliver speeches. The situation was extremely enthusiastic, and the visitors were even more crowded, causing many glass windows to be crushed. The daily business in the Shanghai factory was calculated to be more than 20,000 yuan, which was an unprecedented grand occasion for the delegation. Therefore, the representatives of the Shanghai factory had a letter and telegram to transport two more batches of goods to Hankou, which shows that the people in the area are enthusiastic about using national goods and that the cooperation between the political and business sectors is appropriate, so there are such achievements. Yesterday, the standing committee members of the Citizens' Promotion of National Products Association, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jianruo, Chen Binghui, Wu Zhihao, Hu Xiyuan, and Fang Jiange, held a standing committee meeting and resolved to notify all factories to rush to transport two batches of goods to meet the needs of Hankou.</p>

<h3>Requesting Investigation of National Goods Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation and other groups yesterday, saying, "Received a letter from the Qingdao National Goods Exhibition Hall, stating, 'Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce in our country, and also the location where national goods merchants and factories are concentrated.

We are correspondingly communicating by letter and hope that your association will list the name, address, and person in charge separately, and enclose the organizational rules, and send them to the association immediately for forwarding."</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<h3>Discussing the Problem of Rickshaws</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, the Public Works Bureau's Security Committee and Vehicle Affairs Committee held a joint meeting to discuss the issue of rickshaws. All attendees were members and staff of the Public Works Bureau. Yesterday's (15th) newspaper reported that the rickshaw trade association had nominated Yin Zhiling and Gu Songmao to attend the Public Works Bureau to request participation, but after repeated consideration by the Public Works Bureau, they were immediately allowed to do so, which is inaccurate.</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reported that the joint meeting of the Security Committee and the Transportation Committee convened last night. It is said that a resolution was reached to request the Public Works Bureau to take direct action to implement most of the articles listed in the Marseille Report. During the discussion of the articles, all those who expressed their views were eager for the Public Works Bureau to take action as soon as possible. As for the proposal put forward by the Marseille Committee to organize a rickshaw company to operate independently, without contact with existing rickshaw companies, it was also thoroughly studied at the time. However, whether this proposal can prove to be the most practical solution, there is still no certainty.</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that the Public Works Bureau Council will convene on Wednesday next week. It is said that the council members generally agree to limit the daily rental fee for rickshaws to eight jiao (cents) in small foreign currency. If there is excessive profit-taking, the rickshaw license will be revoked as a warning. This is almost certain, according to the Sichuan merchant community.</p>
<h3>Opposing the Price Increase of Shanghai-Chongqing Steamers</h3>
<p>Stopping business as a form of resistance</p>
<p>The Chongqing Hardware and Sundries Trade Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday stating that the current alliance price increase of Shanghai-Chongqing steamers is as high as two or three times, and the lowest is also 100%. Moreover, the old habit of deducting hair has been completely destroyed, resulting in freight exceeding the cost of goods, which is too numerous to mention. This kind of arbitrary and crude action is unanimous. They felt that the Sichuan commercial situation has been extremely depressed. What could further devastate the already withered flower? Moreover, with the national humiliation yet to be avenged, all sectors of the country should work together to resist foreign aggression. Now, the Shanghai-Chongqing steamers ignore public interests and harm others for their own benefit. If Japanese ships intend to resume navigation, this opportunity will be seized to facilitate the profiteering of fishermen. This is like providing the enemy with weapons and provisions and is insane. Therefore, yesterday, a joint meeting of various Shanghai merchant guilds was held, and everyone was indignant. The atmosphere in the entire venue suddenly became tense. As a result, a unanimous decision was made to suspend business from today onwards as a form of resistance. They vowed not to sell Shanghai goods to Chongqing again until the original price target was restored. The members of our association unanimously believe that the commercial situation has been extremely depressed in recent years, and the pain has been particularly severe. They strongly support this resolution. The business of our association is closely related to the agricultural and industrial sectors. Now that production and construction are established as national policies, if, in addition to the depressed situation, there is also exploitation by water transport costs, then the direct destruction of our fellow traders will be a minor harm. The indirect impact on the agricultural and industrial sectors will hinder the major plan of establishing the country, and the future of the Republic of China will be unthinkable. Therefore, this special letter is sent, and it is requested that your association be enthusiastic and assist in arguing according to reason, aiming to restore the original price. It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already forwarded the letter to the Shipping Trade Association for verification.</p>

<h3>Records of Contemporary Figures' Movements</h3>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, Qin Zhen, and Wang Zhengting left Beijing on the night express train yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>Director of the Fisheries Protection Office</p>
<h3>Yuan Lianghua Returned to Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yuan Lianghua, director of the Fisheries Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry, went to Beijing a few days ago to consult with the ministry regarding fisheries protection matters, and returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Yuan's statement to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, the Ministry of Industry has been actively seeking to improve fisheries protection facilities, but due to budget limitations, it has not been possible to achieve anything. It is necessary to wait for the approval of the central financial budget for this year. If the central government increases the funding for the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry will decide to start improving fisheries protection equipment, such as patrol ships, which will be added. As for the seven fishing vessels that the Ministry ordered from the German Xiwang Company, the price is more than 2.2 million yuan. The company has no problems, but the Ministry is still considering whether the effectiveness of the ship production is clear.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Investigation</p>
<h3>Shipping Office Inspectors Assault and Humiliate Merchants</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that it was submitting a report to request prompt investigation of the case of inspectors from the Shipping Office of the Wusong Municipal Public Bureau assaulting and detaining employees of merchants. The case occurred on the 14th of this month, according to a letter from Zhang Zengjie, director of the Wusong branch of the associated guild, stating that the company's Wanxing merchant ship, loaded with aquatic fish, arrived in Wusong at about 8:00 AM on the 8th of this month. The company handled the customs declaration and the Wusong Office of the Shipping Office, requesting inspection and registration on file. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 PM, an inspector from the Shipping Office suddenly came to Wusong and went to the Wanxing ship to investigate, falsely claiming that the Wanxing ship had concealed tonnage dues and imposed a fine of 40 yuan. The ship owner, feeling unjustly penalized, could not submit and came to the company to request that someone be sent to explain. The company immediately sent Lin Jinsheng to explain with the ship owner. Unexpectedly, the ship inspector Wang Chunsen and others were unreasonable and not only did not accept the company's explanation but also violently beat the company's employee Lin Jinsheng. Not satisfied with the beating, they also arbitrarily detained him in the ship, sent him to Shanghai, forced him to sign a document, and detained him for six hours before releasing him. Checking the national taxes and fees is the duty of the people. Now that the ship owner has already reported and requested registration, there is nothing illegal or unreasonable. Forcibly imposing an additional penalty is naturally unacceptable. The company sent someone to request a re-examination, which is also a legitimate procedure. Now, being unjustly assaulted and detained is not only an injustice suffered by the company, but also the future ship merchants will be in an unthinkable situation. Therefore, it is specially reported to the Shanghai Municipal Government to send someone to investigate, to extend grievances, etc. According to this, the Jinwanxing ship is loading and transporting fish to Wusong. All the reporting, fee registration procedures have been completed. Even if the Shipping Office inspector discovers concealed or missed fee matters, he should also declare the facts, which is enough to show obedience. Now, wide abuse of the penalty, sent by the customs reporting company, the staff went to state, but also unreasonable, without unauthorized assault, followed by detention, the employee's this act, in fact, ultra vires, severe suffering merchants, should be investigated according to the law, Lihe according to the situation presented, begging Junfu Jianhe, prompt Ciling went to check the truth, by cleaning up the official administration and Anliang cowardly, in fact, for the public cloud.</p>
<p>Sinking of Cargo Ship by Yongji Warship Case</p>
<h3>Navy Headquarters Refuses Compensation</h3>
<p>Only Willing to Give Shipowner Xu Laofu 100 Yuan</p>
<p>On January 19th of this year, Xu Laofu's iron barge was sunk in the Huangpu River by the Yongji warship, and the ship and cargo were lost. Xu Laofu's family of six, old and young, were fortunately seen and rescued by Dr. Hua Du's ship. Afterwards, the Copper and Iron Trade Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting a special letter to the Navy Headquarters, demanding compensation for the losses, to relieve the difficulties of the merchants, etc. This was reported in the newspapers. This case has not yet been resolved. Shipowner Xu Laofu made a living by loading barges with goods. The whole family lived on the ship. All the savings and furniture for making a living were lost in the water. Once the ship was sunk, food, clothing, housing, and transportation were lost. Although the empty barge has been salvaged, there is no strength to carry out repairs. If the purpose of compensation is not achieved, the whole family will not be able to survive. The situation is very tragic. He has repeatedly complained to the association, and the association has suffered the sinking of 16 tons of pig iron, except for the two tons and three kilograms that have been salvaged. The estimated loss is about 900 yuan. All of them are required to be compensated. On the 20th of last month, Municipal Chamber of Commerce member Zhu Wenqi, together with Copper and Iron Trade Association members Zhang Zilian, Feng Xinmin, and Wu Jiaze, took shipowner Xu Laofu to the Gaochang Temple Navy Headquarters to discuss a solution. Captain Ouyang received them and shipowner Xu Laofu presented the situation of the collision and requested compensation for the losses. Captain Ouyang blamed the shipowner for being careless, resulting in the collision and sinking, and it was difficult to compensate. Considering the plight of the shipowner, he only agreed to give 100 yuan. Municipal Chamber of Commerce member Zhu Wenqi and Copper and Iron Trade Association members Zhang Zilian and others believed that the amount was too different and could not comply. The captain immediately resolutely stated that he could only ask the court to resolve the matter, and the gentlemen immediately said goodbye. It is regrettable that the captain only spoke officialdom and did not speak facts. The Copper and Iron Trade Association has continued to send letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, asking for justice to be upheld and the purpose of compensation achieved, to maintain the difficulties of the merchants.</p>

<h3>The Meiya Factory Labor Dispute Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>Authorities Decide on Handling Measures</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, more than 4,000 workers from the Meiya Silk Weaving General Factory and its various branches went on strike to protest against wage reductions. The following is the latest news as of yesterday:</p>
<h3>Laborers Petition</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the workers of the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory sent more than ten representatives, including Cai Shoufu from the general factory, Kong Qingxian from the second factory, Feng Xianchun from the third factory, Lü Haiquan from the fourth factory, Xia Zhiwei from the fifth factory, Zhu Linchai from the sixth factory, Yu Yilai and Cai Hangsong from the seventh factory, He Yayun from the eighth factory, Sun Zhifen and Tong Chunqi from the ninth factory, Liu Yanqing from the tenth factory, and Pan Yuncai, to the Fenglinqiao Municipal Party Department to petition, requesting assistance so that the matter could be resolved as soon as possible. They were received by Long Peiyun, a staff member of the Civil Movement Section, and Yu Yaoqiu, a staff member of the Investigation Section, who inquired about the cause of the strike and the details of the wage cuts. They promised to investigate the matter together with the Bureau of Social Affairs and then find a way to mediate, hoping that the workers would wait patiently for a resolution and not take any actions that would go beyond the bounds. The workers expressed satisfaction and left.</p>
<h3>Company Notice</h3>
<p>The Meiya Silk Factory issued a notice setting a deadline for workers to resume work, stating that the workers' strike had been repeatedly advised to resume work as soon as possible, but to no avail. It has now exceeded ten days, which not only violates factory rules but also violates government laws and regulations. It is now limited to the 17th of this month to resume work as usual. Do not wait and delay, otherwise it will be regarded as an automatic dismissal in accordance with Articles 26, 3 and 4 of the factory rules approved by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. It should be dismissed uniformly and new workers should be recruited. Do not mistake yourself. This announcement,</p>

They also issued a joint order to the workers to resume work first, and ordered the factory to postpone the wage reduction and mediate quietly.</p>
<p>The Kungwo Steamer Changes to Using "Compradors"</p>
<h3>Tea Boys Hold a General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Decided to Ask the Seafarers' Union to Negotiate According to Law</p>
<p>The British-owned Jardine Matheson Steamship Company plans to change the official cabins of the Kungwo steamer into second-class large dining rooms and reduce the number of workers (tea boys) in the middle cabins and hire stewards (i.e., "compradors") in order to develop its business, which has caused disputes. All the tea boys held a meeting yesterday to discuss how to deal with the situation. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Negotiation Failed</h3>
<p>The British-owned Jardine Matheson Steamship Company has dozens of ships. The company, considering that the business of the official cabins of each ship is not as developed as that of the large dining rooms, has changed the official cabins of the Jiwo, Lungwo, and Suiwo steamers into second-class large dining rooms. Recently, it also wanted to reform the Kungwo steamer and planned to dismiss all the tea boys and hire "compradors," which caused opposition from the workers. The Seafarers' Union repeatedly negotiated, but the company said that the tea boys were not familiar with English and could not be appointed, so there was no result.</p>
<h3>Tea Boys' Meeting</h3>
<p>The ship employs about 90 tea boys. Hearing this news, they believed that the company's move was tantamount to destroying the entire tea boy livelihood. The masses were indignant and convened a general meeting of all tea boys at the Grand Auditorium of the Seafarers' Union in Wengjia Branch Lane, Ximen, at 1:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from the union and various ships attended. The meeting was chaired by Yu Dequan. The results of the discussion were: (1) Ask the General Branch of the Seafarers' Union to negotiate according to law; (2) Unite to resist. The representatives of the ships believed that the matter was closely related, so they all expressed their willingness to be a backup.</p>

<h3>Water Mill Motor Still Not Successful</h3>
<p>Public Works Bureau Confirms It Cannot Operate Automatically</p>
<p>Chen Xinbiao and Shan Chunqiao, two Chinese inventors of water mill motors (i.e., self-powered engines), requested assistance from the Municipal Government of Shanghai and were referred by the First Section of the Municipal Government to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for handling. The Public Works Bureau sent specialized technicians to contact Chen and arranged to jointly test the motors. The tests were conducted twice on the 3rd and 8th of this month, but the motors failed to start. Chen eventually signed a statement certifying that he would submit another request for handling when the entire project was completed.</p>
<p>Bicycle Industry Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</p>
<h3>Discussing the Public Works Bureau's Tax Increase Proposal</h3>
<p>Resolved to Send a Letter to the Taxpayers' Association to Request Cancellation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rental Bicycle Trade Association, because the Public Works Bureau will increase taxes next year, held an emergency meeting at the guild hall on Guling Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures. More than 200 people, including Li Xiaoshi, attended. The meeting was chaired by Ji Hongnian. It was resolved to first send a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to investigate the truth and ask them to cancel the tax increase. The letter to the Taxpayers' Association is as follows: Sirs, Having read the news in the *Shen Xin Daily* on March 10th that the Public Works Bureau will increase bicycle taxes, our industry has been extremely panicked. In recent days, we have received repeated reports from our colleagues, elaborating on the pain of doing business recently. Since the January 28th Shanghai War, we have felt the depression of the market, the decline of all industries, and the decline of the social economy. Our industry is in a slump and is precarious. We have received requests from members to the association, earnestly requesting various agencies to waive miscellaneous taxes and reduce the burden. The request to reduce the suffering of Suzhou merchants has not yet been implemented, and the news of a tax increase has come. The original taxes cannot be borne, how can we bear a tax increase? Our association, in view of the panic and anxiety of our members, has no choice but to elaborate on the business difficulties of our industry and send a letter to your association to investigate the truth of this case. If the Public Works Bureau really intends to implement it, we beg you to consider the difficulties of the merchants, uphold justice, and provide strong assistance. We are determined to achieve the goal of cancellation, and our industry will be very fortunate. We are in a very urgent situation, and we hope that you will see and reply.</p>

<p>Cotton Control Commission Plans to Establish</p>
<h3>Henan Cotton Production Improvement Branch</h3>
<p>Xu Zhongdi and Others Have Been Appointed to Proceed</p>
<p>3,000 Odd Loads of High-Quality Seeds Have Already Been Delivered</p>
<p>Henan Province has a wide cotton-producing area. Except for the Lingbao area in western Henan and the Zhangde area in northern Henan, which have better quality, the rest, such as the Taikang area in eastern Henan, mostly have poor seeds, low yields, and extremely uneven quality, so the selling price is very low. When the cotton is harvested, farmers are eager to sell it, and middlemen monopolize it, so cotton farmers work hard all year round but earn little. The Cotton Control Commission of the National Economic Commission, in view of this, specially sent technical experts Xu Zhongdi and Feng Zefang to Henan to prepare for the establishment of the Henan Cotton Production Improvement Branch, first engaging in improvement and promotion and organizing cooperatives in the Taikang, Qixian, and Suixian areas. The association also appointed Lu Chengzhou as the acting director of the Henan Cotton Production Improvement Branch, Xu Xingmin as the cotton planting instructor of the branch, and Wang Yijiao as the soil cultivation instructor of the branch. In addition, there are several assistants. The Cotton Control Commission received a report from Special Commissioner Xu yesterday, stating that he had visited Director Zhang of the Construction Department on the morning of the 13th, and the result was very satisfactory. In the afternoon, the Construction Department transferred two vehicles from the Highway Bureau for Special Commissioner Xu and others to use for surveying the site in the Qixian, Suixian, and Taikang areas. As for the high-quality seeds, more than 3,000 loads have arrived from Zhangde, enough to plant more than 50,000 mu of cotton fields. In the future, they will gradually be promoted to benefit the farmers of Henan Province.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the term, the Fuhua School for the Deaf and Mute on Jessfield Road has been striving for perfection in everything. In addition to adding a second college and hiring young painter Ms. Zhu Fuxuan as a drawing teacher, it has also been actively reaching out to philanthropists from all walks of life in order to establish a board of directors to seek further development and improvement, as well as economic assistance.

<p>Wu Youshan, Zhang Desheng, Wang Asan, and Others' Appeals Rejected</p>
<p>Xu Leqing, a broker at the Gauze Exchange, was suddenly attacked by kidnappers near the Jing'an Temple bus stop last year. In an attempt to kidnap him, Cao was shot and killed due to Xu's resistance. Later, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspection Office and others arrested the kidnappers in this case: Wu Ziqiu, Wu Youshan, Zhang Desheng, Wang Asan, Wang Lao Jiu, Yao Zhifa, and more than ten others. They were sent to the First Special Court for questioning. Wang Lao Jiu and Yao Zhifa were sentenced to death and have already been executed by shooting. Wu Ziqiu was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Wu Youshan, Zhang Desheng, and Wang Asan were each sentenced to 12 years in prison, as reported in this newspaper.

<p>Daughter of Japanese Revolutionary Leader</p>
<h3>Willing to Marry a Chinese Man</h3>
<p>Indignant at the Evil Reputation of the "Traitor Ashikaga Takauji"'s Descendants</p>
<p>Willing to Abandon Her Noble Family and Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that Ashikaga Tsune, the 26-year-old daughter of Baron Ashikaga at Sonokouchi, a Japanese revolutionary leader, married Zhu Lifu, the manager of the Dachang Refining and Dyeing Company at 566 Huade Road in the city. It is reported that Zhu graduated from the engineering department of Jinling University. Tsune was indignant at the evil reputation of "the descendants of the traitor Ashikaga Takauji" and was willing to abandon her noble family. During her school days, she changed her surname to Sugawara. After graduating, she became a Christian missionary. Later, her mood changed drastically, and she specialized in propagating communism among the Japanese aristocracy. At that time, she fell in love with party member Hisao Atsumi, but she felt quite restricted due to her noble family connections. In 1930, she came to Shanghai and attempted suicide at the Banzai Pavilion, but failed. She was introduced by Pastor Furuya to work as a nurse at the Fumin Hospital. However, because she believed in leftist ideologies, she used the hospital as a base to incite Chinese and Japanese nurses in the hospital and contacted Chinese and Japanese communists in Shanghai. She was later reported by the Consulate General and released shortly afterward. She then became a typist at the Shanghai branch of Mitsui &amp; Co. and gradually became acquainted with Zhu Lifu. Now they have become a formal couple.</p>
<h3>Major Fire on Zhongshan Road</h3>
<p>—One Hundred Forty to Fifty Thatched Sheds Destroyed—</p>
<p>Around 1:30 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the thatched shed inhabited by Tao Kun, a Jiangbei Yancheng native, next to the Toyota workshop on Zhongshan Road, north of the Fawangdu Ditch in western Shanghai. Thick smoke immediately filled the air and burst through the roof. The area was densely packed with thatched sheds, and with the strong winds, the fire quickly spread to the surrounding neighborhood. The fire was raging fiercely. When the Caojiadu and Zhabei fire brigades heard the alarm, they rushed to the scene with their fire engines. However, because the thatched sheds were easily flammable and the affected area was very wide, the fire was beyond control. After the firefighters fought hard to put out the fire for about an hour, it was finally extinguished. Yang Jinxiang, the police chief of the Zhongshan Bridge Police Station in the Sixth District, led the police to the scene to maintain order and immediately conducted an inspection. It was estimated that about 140 to 150 thatched sheds were destroyed, inhabited by over 100 households, half of whom were factory workers. They were all extremely poor. Old and young, men and women, were awakened from their dreams, their cries filled the air, and their condition was pitiable. Police Chief Yang immediately arrested Tao Kun, the person responsible for the fire, and witness Wang, and took them to the Sixth District for interrogation.</p>
<p>Hands Are Red</p>
<h3>Is That a Communist Trait?</h3>
<p>Fudan University Student Zhang Wenlie Arrested Because Of It</p>
<p>Anti-Fascist Leaflets Found in His Pocket</p>
<p>—Released on Bail Due to Lack of Other Evidence—</p>
<p>Zhang Wenlie, a student at Fudan University, was walking near the intersection of Avenue Annam and Jing'an Temple Road in western Shanghai the other day when he was suddenly identified by Kang Shounian, an informant of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, as a communist. He tried to arrest him. Zhang absolutely denied being a communist and refused to be captured. A struggle ensued. A patrolman saw the conflict and asked the reason. Each gave his own version. The patrolman took both parties to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The police chief asked the informant how he knew Zhang was a communist. The informant said that Zhang's hands were red, which was a characteristic. He asked to search Zhang's person. The police chief searched Zhang and found two leaflets in his pocket with language opposing fascism. The pocket was torn. Zhang argued that the leaflets were not his and that the informant had put them in his pocket during the struggle to frame him. As for the redness of his hands, it was due to frostbite. The police chief sent detectives to Zhang's residence at No. 35, New Yuyuan Village, Yuyuan Road, to investigate, but found no evidence of reactionary activity. The next day, he was sent to the Second Branch of the High Court. The Municipal Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the court and requested a transfer, saying that Zhang's communist involvement was based on the confession of a captured communist. The court ordered Zhang to be detained for further investigation. Yesterday, Judge Yu of the Second Branch of the High Court and Judges Zhao and Zhou held a continued hearing. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin and defendant's defense lawyer Xue Dubi both appeared in court. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also brought a detained communist to testify in the case. Judge Yu questioned the defendant and witnesses one by one. Informant Kang Shounian then entered the witness stand and gave a long and impassioned statement. He even made remarks that infringed on the defense lawyer, saying that communists should not have lawyers to defend them. Now there is a lawyer who is a member of the Central Committee and was once the Minister of the Interior defending the communists, so he is no different from a communist. Lawyer Xue, hearing these words, believed that the informant deliberately insulted his personality in the solemn courtroom. He was furious and sternly questioned the informant, warning him not to make insinuations. The atmosphere in the court was tense. Judge Yu stopped it. The result of the investigation was that the court ruled that there was no need to transfer the case, and the defendant was released on bail.</p>
<p>Sudden Death of Young Woman</p>
<h3>Determined to Be Due to Premortem Poisoning</h3>
<p>Whether She Was Forced to Take Poison</p>
<p>Investigated by the Police Department</p>
<p>The late Zheng Yangchu from Chaoyang County, Guangdong, established two pawnshops, Wanfeng and Guanglifeng, at No. 69 Zhengjia Muqiao Street and No. 235 at the corner of Xizilaihuo Street, Caishi Street, in the French Concession. He accumulated assets of over 100,000 yuan. He died five years ago, leaving behind a wife and a concubine, both from the same hometown. The wife, Wu, is 40 years old this year, and the concubine, Huang, is 28 years old. Wu has a daughter, Xue'e, who is 20 years old this year, and adopted a son when her husband was alive, who is 18 years old this year. Huang did not have any children, and adopted a son, Jixian, who is 10 years old this year, after her husband's death. The wife and concubine live together in the new Guanglifeng store. Wu lives in the front building room, and Huang lives with her son and the eldest wife's daughter Xue'e in the three-story pavilion room. The wife and concubine live together, and they are usually harmonious. However, Huang, as a young widow, is often depressed and taciturn. After Zheng's death, the two pawnshops were entrusted to his eldest nephew Zheng Murong for management. In the summer of the year before last, Zheng Wu discovered that her nephew Zheng Murong had engaged in fraudulent activities in the two stores, amounting to over 10,000 yuan. She reported this to the police station and filed a public prosecution against Zheng Murong in the Second Special Court for embezzlement in his capacity. Murong also filed a civil suit, requesting a division of the property. Both cases have not yet been concluded. Members of the same clan have mediated, but the matter has not been resolved because Wu is unwilling to compromise. As a result, Wu has offended some people. Someone threw bombs and filth into the store to intimidate her. On the evening of the 13th, around 8 p.m., Zheng Huang accompanied her son to bed because he was ill. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 a.m. the next morning, Xue'e, the eldest wife Wu's daughter, got up and found Zheng Huang dead in bed. The news spread far and wide. Zheng Jinshun, Zheng Guoan, Zheng Jinzhi, and other nephews learned of the death and reported it to the French police station, saying that Zheng Huang's death was unclear. Because the eldest wife Zheng Wu was usually fierce and abusive, there was suspicion that she had been forced to take poison. They requested an investigation. The police station, after receiving the report, sent Detective Zhang Chunsheng to investigate. It was difficult to determine the truth. The body was taken to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. Yesterday, the police station reported to the Second Special District Court, which commissioned Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with forensic doctor Jiang Jun and clerk Peng Yu, to inspect the body at noon. An olive pit was dug out of the deceased's mouth, but the external shape could not reveal the truth of the death. The official took the bench and first heard the detective's report on the investigation of the case. He questioned Zheng Jinshun, who said that the deceased was his aunt and that he learned of her death from others. He did not know how she died. Zheng Wu, the eldest wife (whose testimony was translated by her daughter because she did not understand the Shanghai dialect), said that the deceased was her husband's concubine and that she did not know how she died. Zheng Xue'e (the eldest wife's daughter) said that the deceased was her stepmother. She took her son to sleep the night before. I slept in the same room, on the opposite bed. I went into the room at 11 o'clock and saw them sleeping soundly. I was doing needlework in the room for about an hour before going to sleep. At 5 o'clock yesterday morning, the younger brother (referring to the deceased's son) got up to urinate. I turned on the light for him. At 8:30, I got up to call her, but she did not respond. I pushed her, but she did not move. When I opened the quilt, I saw that her body was stiff. I was shocked and called my mother and the clerk to come and see, and then I knew she was dead. She liked to eat olives in the past. I don't know how she died, but there was no sound before she died. After verifying the testimony, Lord said that the cause of death could not be determined from the deceased's appearance and that an autopsy would be performed in the afternoon. Zheng Jinshun, Zheng Guoan, and Zheng Jinzhi, who reported the police station, submitted a statement to the court, requesting a detailed examination to respect human life. At 3:30 in the afternoon, Prosecutor Wang, Forensic Doctor Jiang, and Clerk Peng visited the room and performed an autopsy on the body. A small piece of opium dross, which had not yet dissolved, was found in the deceased's stomach. The liquid residue in the stomach was also poured out and smelled, and it had the smell of raw soil and alcohol. After the examination, the official took the bench again and questioned both parties of the deceased's family. It was determined that Zheng Huang died of opium poisoning before her death. The body was claimed by Zheng Wu, a member of the deceased's family. Whether Zheng Huang was forced to take poison will be investigated and handled by the Police Department.</p>
<p>National Products Industry</p>
<h3>Today's Banquet for Needle Manufacturer Yin Zhizhong</h3>
<p>Needle manufacturer Yin Zhizhong had an unusual talent in his youth and dedicated himself to industry. Soon after, he went to study abroad. Realizing that China's clothing needles had always been supplied by other countries, he felt ashamed. So, while studying, he studied needle manufacturing methods day and night. After eight years of hard work, he mastered all the techniques. After returning to China, he founded the Jilu Needle Factory in Qingdao and served as its manager. He carefully manufactured various sewing needles. The materials were excellent and comparable to imported products. They have been sold well in China and Southeast Asia and have established a good reputation. He also participated in various national products exhibitions. However, Yin is not satisfied with this. He often goes to various places to investigate the use of needles. He arrived in Shanghai last night and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products and the Zhengyi Society, etc., specially held a banquet at the Zhengyi Society at No. 184 Nanjing Road today (16th) to welcome him, and invited celebrities from all walks of life to accompany him.</p>

In the future, it will gradually expand to the design and manufacture of various motors. It has now started to raise a capital of 100,000 yuan in national currency and will first establish a factory in Shanghai to engage in manufacturing and business, and has applied to the Ministry of Industry of the National Government for registration.</p>
<h3>Anti-Tuberculosis Association Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Donates 5,000 Yuan at the Banquet</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, the honorary president of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, hosted a banquet for local celebrities at the Municipal Government Reception Office at 7 p.m. last night. Those who attended included Du Yuesheng, Rong Zongjing, Shi Liangcai, Kai Lanting, Wu Daquan, Wang Yansong, and the association's directors Li Ting'an, Wu Liande, Yan Fuqing, Li Dachao, and others. That evening, Wu was unable to attend due to a cold. Li Ting'an, director of the Health Bureau, delivered a speech on his behalf, saying that since the establishment of the association, it has received much support from all walks of life, and we are extremely grateful. However, tuberculosis is rampant today, and the mission of our association is extremely important. The establishment of sanatoriums, prevention hospitals, and temporary clinics is a matter of urgent importance. However, the association's budget plan requires 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, and it cannot be realized without the assistance of all parties. Everyone is a leader in Shanghai, and I believe you will all sympathize with this self-help and life-saving anti-tuberculosis campaign. Therefore, please find a way to make it a reality as soon as possible, which will not only be a blessing for the people of the country, but also a great favor to the colleagues of our association. Next, Yan Fuqing, director of the association and president of the hospital, gave a speech, saying that the harm of tuberculosis and the tuberculosis mortality rate in our country are chilling. If we do not prevent it in advance, the harm will be unimaginable. Therefore, the establishment of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association is a good method, but smooth progress depends on whether there is sufficient financial resources as a prerequisite. I would like to ask you to help us. Then, Zhang Junjun, the general secretary, reported that since the association was established in October of last year, it held a membership recruitment conference on December 15th, which was successful with the help of all sectors. In order to achieve the three-year work plan, the association is holding a fundraising conference to promote the realization of various tasks. According to experts, the three-year budget plan requires a total of over 200,000 yuan. This great salvation work depends on the efforts of everyone to be successful. It is expected that the day when this work is completed will also be the time when the power of tuberculosis in China is eliminated. After the report, the mayor's representative stated that Wu had donated 5,000 yuan as an initiative, and the guests also enthusiastically donated and agreed to serve as fundraising team leaders to solicit donations from all sectors.</p>

<p>Two-Route Administration</p>
<h3>Promoting Spring Travel</h3>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Greet Passengers for Convenience</p>
<p>Reducing Fares and Arranging Hotel Reservations</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, in order to promote spring travel,</p>
<p>specially established convenient travel measures, printed booklets, and distributed them to all sectors. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Promotion: "In the third month of late spring, the grasses grow tall in Jiangnan, miscellaneous flowers bloom on trees, and groups of orioles fly about." These sentences praising the spring scenery of Jiangnan can give an idea of Jiangnan's beauty in the spring. The areas passed through by these two routes, such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, etc., are all scenic spots in Jiangnan. Miscellaneous flowers and groups of orioles can be enjoyed everywhere. There are also outstanding mountains and rivers, and in recent years, many modern constructions have been added, which can supplement the shortcomings of nature. In such bright spring sunshine, touring beautiful places is truly a good way to regulate life. Moreover, the physical constitution of Chinese people is relatively weak, and the living environment tends to be static, so we are promoting travel and sightseeing, and formulating various measures to make travelers feel convenient everywhere.</p>
<p>Convenient Measures: A. Vehicle Transportation: Whether it is a group or an individual, in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, if you need to hire a car, rickshaw, or horse-drawn carriage, you only need to notify this route in advance, and you can hire from the agreed-upon car company. The car fare is the same as the market price. B. Dispatching Personnel to Greet: If you need guidance on sightseeing along the route when traveling on the two routes, you can contact the stations and business offices of this route, and we will dispatch familiar and capable staff to accompany you along the way, take care of everything, and guide you to various places of interest. C. Hotel Reservations: This route has many pre-booked room contracts with large and small hotels in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, etc. Ordinary passengers, if they purchase tickets at the business office of this route, can entrust the business office to book in advance, which can greatly facilitate them. D. Fare Reduction: (1) Student groups of ten or more people will be charged 75% of the ordinary original price for one-way tickets and 50% for round-trip tickets (after the ticket price is reduced, the minimum price per person is 50 cents). (2) The fare reduction method for ordinary round-trip tickets is 75% of the ordinary fare for first class, 75% of the ordinary fare for second class, and 85% of the ordinary fare for third class. Special express surcharges will be charged in full.</p>

<h3>Robbery Case Involving Over 20,000 Yuan Solved</h3>
<p>Instigated by a Laid-Off Cook</p>
<p>Three Criminals Arrested and Handed Over to the Authorities</p>
<p>The case of the North-South Distribution Office of Guangfeng Company, located at No. 11 Hengxing West Lane, Limah Road, 16th Pier, Nanshi, Shanghai, being robbed of 20,600 yuan in cash at 7:20 p.m. on February 4th of this year has been solved. It is learned that Detective Leader Dong Mingde, stationed in District 1 of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, discovered that it was instigated by Zhou Xiaotao from Tongzhou, the laid-off cook of the company. He had colluded with accomplices nicknamed "Living Monkey" Lin Gen, "Little Pockmark" Bao Azhang, and A Lin. After reporting the preliminary information to Team Leader Lu and District Chief Guan, Deputy Leader Han Ruisheng was dispatched to lead detectives and police officers to arrest the suspect Jin Qilang from Chongming, a cart puller, in Chunsen Lumber Company on Anlan Road, Xiaoximen, at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. During the interrogation, Jin confessed, "I only know Zhou Xiaotao. I went to Pinfang Photo Studio in Chenghuang Temple to take pictures, but I don't know about the robbery. However, Zhou and Bao Azhang from Ningbo, who lives at No. 198 Danfeng Road, Xiaodongmen, are very close." According to the confession, Leader Dong immediately dispatched the original team of detectives and police officers from the Second Precinct of District 1 to Bao's house, arrested Bao, and took him to the district. Bao confessed that he met Zhou Xiaotao in August of last year, so Zhou often came to my house to play and chat. At the beginning of September, Zhou discussed with "Little Pockmark" about hating the boss for stopping business and wanting to rob him. He asked "Little Pockmark" if he had connections and if he was confident that the company had about 20,000 yuan. So, they discussed this matter at the end of September and again at the end of October. Lin Gen, nicknamed "Monkey," and A Rong joined them, totaling five people. They decided to buy five pistols in Suzhou and robbed the company on the evening of February 4th. On the 9th, "Little Pockmark" distributed 100 yuan in stolen money to me through Zhou Xiaotao, who is still at large. Lin Gen, the "Monkey," skimmed off 20 yuan, so I only got 80 yuan. Also, on the seventh day of the first lunar month, Zhang Mingfu (aka Blind Man), a carpenter from Changzhou who lives at No. 5, Alley 2, Danfeng Road, cheated me out of 6 yuan." The officers continued to arrest Zhang Mingfu the day before yesterday, bringing the total number of suspects to three. They were all handed over to the Third Division of the General Bureau yesterday morning for legal action.</p>
<h3>Continued Interrogation of Suspects in the Tang Jiapeng Assassination Case</h3>
<p>The case of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of Rongji Amusement Park in the Great World, being assassinated on June 18th of last year has been investigated. The French Concession police arrested the suspects Zhang Xiaosizi (aka Zhang Tinggui) from Funing and Zhao Guangfu from Yangzhou, and confiscated a pistol. After comparing it with the bullet casings found at the scene, it was confirmed that three bullets were fired from this gun. They were handed over to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. Zhao was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Zhang was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment. The two convicts refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. The afternoon before yesterday, Chief Judge Guo of the High Court, along with Judges Fan and Sun, and Chief Prosecutor Zhao, opened the court for trial and appointed lawyer Wang Hengyi to defend the appellants. According to the reasons for dissatisfaction stated by Zhang and Zhao, they both denied knowing anything and claimed that they did not commit the murder and were arrested unjustly, requesting a retrial. However, they did not provide any solid evidence to the contrary. The court ordered a new trial at a later date, and the appellants were still detained pending further instructions.</p>

<h3>National Hero at the Rongji Gong Stage</h3>
<p>Meeting the People of This City Tonight</p>
<p>"Xue Rengui Settles Tianshan with Three Arrows" is one of the greatest national heroes in our country's history. At this time of serious national crisis, we should perform more plays about famous ancient generals with outstanding martial arts to awaken the patriotic spirit of the people. The Rongji Gong Stage in this city has newly arranged a play about Xue Rengui, using official history as the warp and folk legends as the weft. The first part starts with the Eastern Qi Kingdom offering tribute to Goryeo and Gai Suwen robbing treasures, and ends with Xue Rengui entrusting Liang and exchanging halberds and subduing the three bandits of Fenghuoshan. Dramas that combine history and patriotism are prone to being dry and boring, but this play is full of interest. From beginning to end, there is no dull scene. It is named a historical drama, but it combines heroism, romance, chivalry, and sorrow in one furnace. Such a good play is rare in our country's theaters. The stage spared no expense to specially produce multiple exquisite sets, which change rapidly and are wonderfully unpredictable. They are brilliantly dazzling and can be called a spectacle. It is said that the premiere is scheduled for tonight.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the news report in your newspaper on the 12th of this month concerning the Jingde steamship running aground outside the Wusong Estuary, we have verified that it is completely inconsistent with the facts. According to the investigation, the Jingde steamship departed from Chongming and arrived at the port at the scheduled time without running aground. This is likely a mistaken rumor. We are sending this letter to request a correction. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lichong Steamship Bureau, March 15th</p>
<h3>Reading Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Further Discussion on Literary</p>
<p>Study Steps</p>
<p>Writing and Others</p>
<p>—A General Response to Messrs. Zhang Yiyan, Wu Kexun, Pan Fengshi, Ji Li, Cheng Tiesheng, Zheng Guoqin, et al.</p>
<p>We had a general discussion not long ago on the question of how to study literature. Now, because many readers are still writing in, requesting a clearer and more specific answer to this question, we are providing a few more opinions as a general response.</p>
<p>According to many letters, we see that in the minds of most people studying literature, there are three most basic problems that are considered urgent to solve: (1) What is the literature we need? (2) How to read literary books? (3) How to create? These three questions, if viewed together, can also be said to be the steps in studying literature.</p>
<p>(1) What is the literature we need? When we begin to study literature, the first difficulty we encounter is seeing the vast number of literary books, and not knowing where to start. In fact, there is no need to worry about this. If we have correct answers to the two prerequisite questions: "Why study literature?" and "What is the literature we need?", then the difficulty will be easily overcome. We know that literature is no longer just something for men of letters to enjoy, but something that expresses the complexity of a specific social life through images (words). Literature can expose the evils of a society, literature can depict the progress of a new society, and literature can enhance the interest in human life. The artistic value of literature is estimated in conjunction with its social value; that is to say, the literature of a certain era is most valuable at that time, and after that era, its value will inevitably decrease. From this point of view, it is clear that we study literature not for entertainment, nor solely to learn some writing skills, but because we want to understand the truth of the social activities we are in from within literary works; from within literary works, we want to obtain information for our current lives. Thus, the literature we need is undoubtedly the work that best fits the current society, and is most capable of shouting out the pain of our current lives and pointing out the course of life. Some people suggest reading *Guwen Guanzhi* ("Anthology of Ancient Prose"), our answer is: *Guwen Guanzhi* is definitely not what we need. Old Chinese literature, in coordination with the decline of Chinese society into a semi-feudal state, is always circling within forms. What it leaves us is only the remains of those forms. Ask: which of the essays of the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song dynasties has anything to do with our current society and life? Moreover, the editors of *Guwen Guanzhi* forcibly divide the structure of each article into "beginning, development, transition, and conclusion," making it rigid. Even if you want to study ancient prose, or want to learn some writing skills from it, this is not a very good anthology of ancient prose. Secondly, some people suggest reading *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Our answer is, likewise, that it is not needed. *Dream of the Red Chamber* is indeed a valuable literary work, but its value lies in the fact that it can comprehensively and intricately express the licentious life of the declining aristocracy at that time. Now, society has changed, and what has replaced the aristocracy are warlords and bureaucrats. Their licentiousness and brutality are no longer as depicted in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, but have taken on a new guise. In this way, what *Dream of the Red Chamber* gives us is only sexual stimulation and temptation. We are not like young masters and misses who have leisure and elegance, so how can we have the mood to enjoy that sensual entertainment? In addition, chivalrous novels and boring triangular or quadrangular love novels that are currently popular are all unnecessary. Chivalrous novels intentionally avoid real society and lead people to think wildly. Current society is evil, and to transform this society, each basic active cell of society—that is, we ourselves who suffer the most—must take responsibility. But what chivalrous novels tell us is to wait for those heroes with chivalrous hearts and the ability to swallow bullets and spit out swords to save us. That kind of hero will never exist in the world, so we can only be forever mired in groaning and pain. This is a deception, a kind of anesthesia! As for boring love novels, although their form of expression is different from chivalrous novels, their function is no different. It does not avoid reality but distorts reality, attempting to use sexual stimulation to soften the pain we suffer, to ease our criticism of current society, and thus to block our way to survival. Ask: in our difficult lives, why should we waste time and energy reading literary works that are useless and greatly harmful to us?</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the literature we need must be the literature that vividly depicts the complexity and richness of life, under the source of progress in current society, within the key to affirmation and negation. We read "The True Story of Ah Q" because "The True Story of Ah Q" not only depicts a typical peasant figure in the early Chinese revolution, but also depicts the overall face of Chinese society, which is mired in a semi-feudal state. We read "Midnight" because "Midnight" indicates the inevitable collapse of Chinese industrial capital under the double attack of rural bankruptcy and imperialist dumping. However, what we should pay attention to here is that in our China, which has a low level of culture, and where new culture has not yet had sufficient opportunity to develop, the readable literary works that are relatively rich in social significance are still extremely scarce. Therefore, we cannot but rely on those great works translated from foreign countries. (Of course, many foreign works are also boring.) From the present point of view, the field of literature has no national boundaries, just as China can no longer close itself off. We can no longer harbor prejudice, and no longer fear the demise of old Chinese literature. Those who see it that way are merely trying to exert their share of power to hinder the development of new culture. Having recognized these, we should no longer find it difficult to choose literary books to read. (Regarding the books that should be read, we plan to provide a more detailed book list in the future, so we will not go into detail here.)</p>
<p>Next, we will talk about how to read literary books.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes About Eating</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>The conversation at spring banquets often "talks about eating," discussing many anecdotes about eating. There is an old Mr. Pan with a beard that reaches his abdomen, who has traveled half of China and is familiar with anecdotes about eating. The following "history of gluttony" is what he told while laughing and stroking his beard: During the Qianlong reign, the Grand Strategist Fukang'an was a gluttony expert; when state and county officials were handling his affairs, everyone shook their heads. One day, Grand Strategist Fu passed by a certain county. Knowing that this was a barren county, he was particularly considerate and did not ask the county magistrate to prepare a full table of dishes, only "boiled pork" would suffice.</p>
<p>Boiled pork is a very common dish that does not cost much money. The county magistrate was relieved to hear these instructions and was about to order the kitchen to prepare it accordingly. However, he was informed by Grand Strategist's entourage that there was no need for the county magistrate to prepare it. He only needed to present fat pigs, and Grand Strategist's own cooks would know how to prepare it according to the law. The county magistrate thought that one fat pig would be enough for one meal of boiled pork. However, Grand Strategist's entourage demanded fifty fat pigs, which was the minimum limit, and not one could be missing. The county magistrate had to requisition fifty fat pigs everywhere and send them to the Grand Commissioner's residence to prepare for Grand Strategist Fu's meal of boiled pork.</p>
<p>The county magistrate was curious in his heart, why would so many fat pigs be needed for one meal of boiled pork? When it was time for Grand Strategist's lunch, he went to the residence very respectfully to take care of things. The so-called taking care of things was actually to see how the boiled pork made from these fifty fat pigs was prepared. He saw that there were many small dishes on the table, mostly salty, spicy, sour, and sweet, which were prepared for dipping the boiled pork in. After everything was arranged, the cooks carried two large basins stacked with boiled pork that was about a foot high to the table. This kind of boiled pork was simply unheard of. Each piece was as round as the seasonal spring pancakes on the market, with fat meat around the circumference and lean meat in the middle, stacked layer upon layer, with no difference in the surroundings. How was it made? After Grand Strategist Fu had a full meal, he took his entourage to another place.</p>
<p>After the imperial envoy left, the county magistrate went to visit the kitchen near the residence and heard a series of pig's screams. It turned out that the fifty fat pigs were struggling in a pool of blood. Only four pieces of hip meat were cut from each fat pig, and the two pieces on the surface were not used. The hip meat cut from the second knife was used, so the circumference was fat, and the center was lean.</p>
<p>Fukang'an, who had a full meal, went far away, and five hundred fat pigs without buttocks were still wailing in the pool—</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Wu Zhiying</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Wu Zhiying, the wife of Lian Nanhu, is now heard to have passed away due to illness. She was a senior member of the women's circle, another weakened, which is very deplorable. Therefore, I will describe one or two anecdotes to inform the readers. Madam is the niece of Mr. Wu Zhipu of Tongcheng. Her father's name was Baoshan, and he was a county magistrate in a certain county in Shandong. He had the reputation of being a good official and was quite known for his political achievements. Madam had no younger siblings and was doted on as a child. Although she was a talented woman, she was treated no differently than a son. As she grew up, she became proficient in classics and history, and was especially good at calligraphy. She was slender and graceful, and was treasured by the literati. She had indeed obtained the legacy of Madam Wei.</p>
<p>Lian Nanhu of Wuxi was a director in the Ministry of Revenue during the late Qing Dynasty. Madam was with him there, and almost all the dignitaries in Beijing knew Madam's name. Empress Dowager Cixi admired her calligraphy and was able to enjoy rewards together with Yu Shenshou's exquisite embroidery, which was called a momentary competition. At that time, Liu Tieyun had a stele inscription in his collection, which was a legal treasure rarely seen in the world. However, Madam wanted him to part with it, and they fought over it for many years without success, eventually leading to a rift. This was spread as a good story in the capital. When Nanhu resigned and returned to the south, he built a villa in the western suburbs of Shanghai, calling his residence "Wanliu Caotang" ("Ten Thousand Willow Thatched Cottage"). Among the weeping willows, the scenery was superb. Madam called herself "Madam Wanliu" ("Madam Ten Thousand Willow"), and was inseparable from the famous courtesan Li Pingxiang. Because Pingxiang was good at chanting, their communication became closer and closer, to the point of not hesitating to remove her hairpins and earrings to redeem her from her registration. Her chivalry and love for talent were something that even men could not match. When Qiu Jin's case of being beheaded in Tinglin arose, Madam exerted herself to help, but to no avail. She and Xu Jichen and others finally buried her bones at the foot of West Lake, and erected a stele to inscribe it. Not long after, Chang Hui, an official of the Censorate, heard about it and sent a memorial to impeach her, so her tomb was cut down. Madam relied on the strength of the female missionary Mai Meide to escape by luck. By the time of the Xinhai Revolution, the righteous voice rose in Hubei. From then on, she was reburied in Xiling, and thousands of people in Shanghai held ropes to help carry the coffin. They used noodles to make extremely large turtles resembling Zhang Zengzhi, the governor of Zhejiang, and Gui Fu, the prefect of Shaoxing, and followed them in the procession, all because of Madam's fight.</p>
<p>Madam wrote a copy of the Surangama Sutra, which was extremely valuable. She said of herself, "Today, there are many fleshy eyes, and no one can recognize it. In five hundred years, they should appreciate it between the writing brush and the ink." She wanted to build a seven-level pagoda as a foundation for the Sutra, but she never succeeded. Now, Madam's lifetime of handwriting, I don't know where it has fallen.</p>
<h3>Change</h3>
<p>— Qian Zuizhu</p>
<p>With a creak, the door suddenly opened. The dispirited Jiying came jumping into my room with a letter in his hand. He kept shouting:</p>
<p>"Linbo's letter is here! Linbo's letter is here!" I was startled by him! Looking at his face, some joy was revealed in his tightly knit brows! A hint of red light also appeared on his haggard forehead.</p>
<p>"What does Linbo's letter say?"</p>
<p>I asked faintly, knowing that this was not good news.</p>
<p>"He is waiting for me in Dalian to go to Kuanchengzi together. If the travel expenses are not enough, he told me to ask Zhang Guojie in Tianjin for them."</p>
<p>Jiying told me loudly and happily.</p>
<p>"Zhang Guojun? Isn't that the guy Touyama Matajiro?"</p>
<p>Perhaps my tone was a little serious, making Jiying a little hesitant:</p>
<p>"Yes...yes...it's him, but...I for..."</p>
<p>Jiying discovered some embarrassment.</p>
<p>"No matter what for? I don't think you have reached the point of selling yourself to rely on others..."</p>
<p>My words were not finished, and Jiying became angry!</p>
<p>"What do you mean by selling myself to rely on others? That's too disrespectful!"</p>
<p>"Yes! My words are a little straightforward: but please forgive my personality."</p>
<p>"You only care about your personality, and don't care about people's faces, lives, and each person has his own aspirations, goodbye."</p>
<p>Jiying left with a bang, venting his angry attitude.</p>
<p>Jiying is gone! And I, immersed in sad reveries, couldn't help but want to cry!</p>
<p>Three years ago, Jiying, who was on the seat of the student union representative, was what kind of person? And what kind of person is he now? Who made him change like this? Alas!</p>
<h3>Complaining About the Job You're In</h3>
<p>— Jiang Liusheng</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Zhang Bingduo's article "Literati" in the Japanese section, I couldn't help but express a lot of sympathy. Two or three years ago, I was also a person who buried myself in paperwork all day long, writing non-stop in what is called a writing career. Later, because the life of a literati was too miserable and too pitiful, they even died from overwork. No one even felt sorry for them, and they were sometimes ridiculed and sarcastically given a eulogy of "not worth dying for" if they were given a little condolence money. So, I was determined to throw away my bald brush, become a monk halfway, and change my career to the advertising industry. Before I knew it, I had been mixed up for more than two years. Although I was much more comfortable and smooth in terms of economic and spiritual aspects, sometimes I still felt the pain of being at the mercy of others and swallowing my anger. As the saying goes, "complaining about the job you're in" is indeed true.</p>
<p>I can hear the tone of complaint and lamentation in teahouses and restaurants at any time. How someone is suffering, how someone is complaining about their fate, and in A's case, they always think that if they reach B's position, they will definitely be comfortable and avoid pain. When A really reaches B's position, A will complain again and again, just like before.</p>
<p>Alas! It is human nature to like the new and dislike the old, but unfortunately, the self-selection of occupations and the change of positions cannot be as desired. No wonder warlords, politicians, great men, and celebrities want to fight each other and seize power. (However, this is a reward)</p>
<h3>Research on Inkstones (3)</h3>
<p>— Wuliaoke</p>
<p>(II) The trend of pragmatism to artistic inclination</p>
<p>Why does the practical inkstone gradually tend towards artistic inclination? The reason is very simple: First, Chinese people are rich in elegant and noble entertainment. "If a workman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools" is an ancient motto. The tools that literary, calligraphy, and painting masters of the past have relied on are the four treasures of the study. Among the four treasures, inkstones are especially valued. The ancients said that brushes live for days, ink lives for months, and inkstones live for generations. The intention is clear. It is also said: bright windows and clean desks, fine brushes and ink, are the pleasures of literati. Inkstones should also be included. Since people love their inkstones, they spare no effort to think and research each item to express its beauty, so the size, style, carving, inscription, and material style of the inkstone box also progress with the progress of literature and art, and change with the changes of the times and tastes. Therefore, it is not unfounded to say that the inkstone is sufficient to represent the art and literature of the times. Second, the trend of loving inkstones was initiated in the imperial palaces, and the literary attendants echoed it, so the trend spread extremely easily. Chinese art and literature gradually began to develop after the Qin and Han dynasties. At that time, inkstones were very simple. The concave inkstones that were popular in the Jin dynasty, and the later human-faced inkstones and Phoenix Pool basket-shaped inkstones, were already novel and special, but their production was also simple. For example, the inkstones carved by Wang Xizhi, Wang Xianzhi, and Gu Kaizhi, as seen in the spectrum, are very few. By the early Tang dynasty, Emperor Taizong and Emperor Gaozong promoted culture at the top, and literary figures, calligraphers, and painters such as Yu Shinan, Ouyang Xun, Chu Suiliang, Wu Daozi, Wang Wei, Yan Zhenqing, etc., emerged one after another. Therefore, the production style of inkstones gradually changed and improved. It was necessary to be appropriate and suitable for use, and to seek fine and pleasing workmanship. The patterns gradually increased. In the late Tang dynasty, the carving on the side of the inkstone became popular, and the carving method changed. Zhao Song, which rose three hundred years after the Tang dynasty, re-promoted and carried forward culture. There were many scholars who were proficient in poetry, prose, and painting, so the carving of inkstones became more and more beautiful. According to Du Wan's Yunlin Stone Spectrum, there are more than seventy styles of inkstones. Shang Sisun's Inkstone Note's inkstone illustration says that there are twenty-four kinds of inkstones that are close to elegance, as follows:</p>
<p>Phoenix Pool, Jade Hall, Jade Terrace, Penglai, Biyong, Academy style, Fang Xiang style, Langguan style, Sky Inkstone, Wind character, Human face, Gui, Bi, Axe, Tripod, Ding, Yuqu</p>
<p>Curved water, Eight edges, Four straight, Lotus leaf, Toad, Horse hoof</p>
<p>According to the inkstone illustrations on Wenfang Sicao, in addition to the above twenty-four kinds, there are also basket styles, melon styles, fairy peach styles, bell styles, egg styles, turtle styles, shuttle styles, zither styles, pipa styles, double fish styles, group styles, moon styles, waist drum styles, moon pool styles, etc. As for the wind-character style, there are so-called draped skirt wind characters, flat-bottom wind characters, footed wind characters, ancient style wind characters, zither-footed wind characters (and it is explained that the Xuanhe reign period's imperial government descended in style, the shape is like a wind character, such as the Phoenix Pool style, but there are four rings carved with seawater fish and dragon three sacred mountains and water pools made in the shape of Kunlun, with the left sun and right moon stars arranged to supply the Supreme Emperor's book office), and the four straight styles have so-called ancient style four straight, double brocade four straight, Hehuan four straight. The eight-edged styles have so-called eight-edged corner handle held inkstones, eight-edged held inkstones, bamboo joint held inkstones. There are even more names. The Song dynasty inkstone style, recorded in Tang Jizhi's Shezhou Inkstone Spectrum, also occasionally differs. In short, this kind of inkstone style change probably originated in the palace, which can be believed.</p>
<h3>Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p>
<p>Tearful Faces Send People Away from Home to Distant Garrison</p>
<p>Wind and Sand All Night Long Go Out of the Fortress to Station in a Lonely City</p>
<p>Shili stood outside laughing and shouting; don't sleep, there are guests coming to the fort. The person inside heard an unfamiliar voice and asked several times who it was. Everyone followed the loess wall and saw two closed sorghum doors with two red square pieces of paper with the character "喜" ("happiness") written on them. This kind of thing shot into Ziqiang's eyes and made his heart move involuntarily. Looking at the red paper again, it was still unusually bright, clearly posted not long ago. Ziqiang stared blankly and hadn't said a word yet. The two sorghum doors were pulled open, and a middle-aged man came out, wearing a blue cloth cotton robe and a blue cloth mandarin jacket. Although the people outside the pass don't know how to comb that artistic hair, the duck-butt style combed on the back half of the head is jet black and shiny, which is clearly the bridegroom. He saw four soldiers and stammered early: old old...general, ask ask...who? While speaking, his eyes turned and his body kept retreating. Ziqiang waved his hand and said: Don't be afraid, we are here to talk to the fort director here, please tell me where he lives? Before he could answer, a woman shouted: Run for your life, big...big soldiers are coming tens of thousands of them. This shout caused the dogs in the fort to bark, and people came out of each loess house. Ziqiang knew very well that the people of Rehe Province had suffered from the harassment of the local bandit-turned-soldiers, so they were frightened out of their wits when they saw the soldiers coming. He had to stand in the center of the village house, waving his hands and shouting not to be afraid, not to be afraid. But he had been blown by the wind and sand all night, and his face was stained with wind and sand like Zhang Fei, and even his nose and eyes could not be distinguished. The gray uniform on his body had become half black, and the yellow mud on his feet was level with his trouser legs. Even without weapons on his body, he was a living ghost, let alone that he had a pistol and the people who followed him each carried a rifle, which was even more terrifying. He opened his mouth, revealing white teeth on his black face. Everyone could only see him getting anxious, and couldn't hear what he was saying. The more he waved and shouted, the more people ran away. (337)</p>

<h3>Request Jiangsu Provincial Government to Maintain Education Funds</h3>
<p>Local Budget Meeting Resolutions Hinder Education</p>
<p>Jiading County Education Association telegraphed yesterday requesting exemption from reduction</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Finance Department previously held a local budget meeting, preparing to implement tax cuts starting from the 23rd year. Although it stated that education funds would not be reduced, according to reliable sources, a certain section chief of the Education Department strongly argued with the provincial government about this matter to the point of resigning but was unsuccessful, indicating the seriousness of the situation. The Shanghai County Education Association had previously telegraphed the Ministry of Education and the provincial government to appeal. Yesterday, the Jiading County Education Association also telegraphed the provincial government and the Education Department, strongly requesting exemption from reduction. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To Chairman Chen and Director Zhou Jun of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government and the Education Department, respectively: Our Jiangsu Province has long been known as a land of culture. According to recent statistics, there are 4,620,536 school-age children in the province, while only 624,240 children are enrolled in school. The number of out-of-school children reaches over 85 percent. Given the urgency of foreign aggression and the perilous state of the nation, we should focus all our efforts on school education, which is the foundation of the nation, and fully expand local education funds, which are the lifeblood of education, to plan for the long-term cultivation of talent and to seek a way for national survival. However, since the restriction of land tax to 101 yuan and the regulation of 1.6 jiao per mu, it has become a pie in the sky, and the door to opening up sources of education funds has been blocked. As a result, the plans of various counties to actively expand education have become fantasies. From then on, no matter how well-thought-out and proactive the administrators of Jiangsu education are, they will find it difficult to escape the scope of maintaining the status quo. Moreover, there are even more cases where counties, due to famine, war, and the short collection of fixed expenses, have accumulated debts and cannot even maintain the status quo. Recently, the Finance Department held a local budget meeting for the 22nd year, and again allocated 20 percent of the autumn survey's actual tax revenue as the general reserve fund for various undertakings in the county, in preparation for tax cuts in the 23rd year. This method has already been clearly announced in the instruction to the Changshu County Government on January 22nd. This association previously believed that education funding was insufficient, but hoped that a good harvest and the absence of war would make it easier to gradually increase it. Now, not only is there no hope of increasing it, but the move to reduce it is being prepared for implementation. Witnessing this, we find it difficult to remain silent. The collection of taxes is borne by the people, and the education funds collected from the people are still used for the benefit of the people. Investing one cent of money today will yield ten times the results in the future, which cannot be compared to other passive expenses. Therefore, even if it is slightly heavy, it is not considered harsh. Moreover, the amount collected per mu is extremely small, and even if the people's strength is exhausted, they would not be unable to bear this trivial amount. However, when accumulated, it will have a great impact on the education of the entire province. If education funds are actually reduced, the current state of education in various counties will be impossible to maintain, and what was once known for its cultural development will turn into educational bankruptcy. Tracing the origin and entrusting the matter in detail, who will bear this heavy responsibility and blame? We dare to telegraph Your Honor to request that you exempt the reduction of local education funds, which are the lifeblood of education, in order to maintain the status quo and avoid bankruptcy. The telegram is urgently sent, and we hope that you will graciously review and accept it. With utmost sincerity, the Jiading County Education Association bows.</p>

<p>Discussing Issues: The discussion then turned to "Several Fundamental Issues in Education." (A) Outline of the Issues: Regarding the social purpose of education, (1) whether to follow the established educational goals to cultivate good citizens under the political and economic system of the current society, (2) whether to rely on education to create a pre-planned new social system, overturn the old system, and use schools to plant a new social foundation, (3) whether to provide a rich environment to fully develop each child, allow them to freely choose their needs, and be able to recreate their society. (B) Regarding national (state) and world (international) goals, (1) whether to educate all children in the country to prioritize the needs of the country and to give less weight to their own conscience, or vice versa, (2) whether to adopt the same attitude towards obedience to the law, (3) when teaching national history, should children be given a purely objective and accurate view, or should the accuracy of historical facts be sacrificed to cultivate in children a certain ideal or the psychology of worshiping national heroes.</p>
<p>Members' Opinions: (1) Chen Kemei's opinion is divided into (1) an analysis of this issue, (2) which can be summarized into the following two issues, namely the attitude of education and the power of education.

(3) Ou Yuanhuai's opinion is divided into (1) this is a problem of the individual and the environment, (2) transforming the individual to adapt to the environment, or changing the environment to adapt to the individual, or both parties change to establish a suitable relationship, (3) educators should be pioneers and strive for social transformation, and should not follow the crowd. (4) Shao Shuangqiu's opinion is divided into (1) educators should teach children to adapt to the environment, (2) this issue is a question of which of the three paths of capitalism, communism, and fascism to follow. (5) Shu Xincheng's opinion is divided into (1) the purpose of education must be transferred according to politics, and the specific approach should be determined by national policy, so education is a tool, (2) education is political and also supra-political, (3) the purpose of education is to create a cooperative society and a self-reliant individual, (4) education funding should be borne by the state. (6) Chen Qingshi's opinion is that in reality, this issue is two attitudes, that is, whether to regard education as a tool or as an end. (7) Zha Liangzhao's opinion is divided into (1) each person's attitude cannot be forced to be the same, (2) the close relationship between political education, (3) thinking of the following two questions based on personal experience, one is whether the affairs we are doing in the school now are education, and the other is whether the current schools can be regarded as educational institutions.

<p>Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center</p>
<h3>Supplementary Notes on the Anniversary Speech of the Establishment</h3>
<p>The other day, the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center held its first anniversary celebration. The chairman of the board, Sun Zhesheng, was in Beijing on official business and specially entrusted Ye Gongchuo to represent him as chairman. The grand occasion was reported in various newspapers. We have learned that the speeches of the directors at that time had slight discrepancies, so we are supplementing the notes as follows:</p>
<p>Director Li Shizeng: Briefly stated that the work of this center is based on the teachings of the Premier, and there are many issues, so many that one does not know where to start. Today, I will only extract two words from Sun Yat-sen's ideology, or rather the ideology of this center, which is "mutual assistance." The meaning of mutual assistance is very common. In theory, it is mutual assistance versus competition; in ideology, it is mutual assistance versus struggle. Whether to adopt competition or struggle is a question not only for those outside the party, but also for many comrades within the party. The rampant behavior of the Communist Party in recent years is also due to a misunderstanding of this meaning. The Premier mentioned it very concisely in his teachings, briefly stating that "the state and society are bodies of mutual assistance..." The entire nation and the entire party, whether in the theory or ideology of mutual assistance, should apply it culturally or educationally. Last year, this center mainly focused its scholarships on biology, and this year it will mainly focus on education, which is in line with this meaning.</p>
<p>Director Kong Yongzhi: Briefly stated that the Premier struggled for forty years, completely embracing the ideology of sacrifice and saving the world. His spirit can be left as a lasting memorial for future generations, namely this sacrifice for the people and not for individuals, and the aspiration to save China and save the world. The most important thing for revolutionaries is to talk less and do more, how to implement the ideology, how to instill it into the masses, and how to spread it to the world. To achieve this goal, everyone must work hard. Those who gather here today are all loyal believers of the Premier. The first thing is to learn the Premier's spirit of sacrifice and the ideology of saving the world, and be able to first follow and believe in one's own scope, and then propagate and promote it, starting from China to achieve the realization of a world for all and the great harmony of the world. Only by shouldering this mission can we be worthy of being loyal believers of the Premier. I am willing to encourage this with my dear comrades.</p>
<p>Director Cai Yuanpei: Briefly stated that the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center is to inherit the Premier's legacy and carry it forward. The Premier's forty years of revolution focused on politics. Looking at his teachings, politics is also the most prominent. Politics cannot be carried out alone and must be promoted by culture. The last chapter of nationalism talks about how Chinese culture is higher than European culture. The chapters on knowing is easy but doing is difficult and industrial construction have many citations, such as how China was the first to have the compass, printing, and gunpowder. Mr. Zhesheng's initiation of the Cultural and Educational Center is also in view of the fact that various levels of government have taken on the matters that need to be done in politics. For the sake of division of labor, there must be an organization to do cultural work. Culture includes too much, so we should prioritize what is urgent. The chairman just reported that the undertakings that have been carried out in recent years are already quite numerous, and it is good if they can be continued for a long time. Such as land survey, detailed research to find solutions, is not only a Chinese problem, but also a major problem in the world. For education, go to various places for inspection, there are things that should be improved, things that should be promoted, and things that need to be experimented with. Proposing solutions will definitely contribute a lot to the country. Scholarships and financial aid help poor and hardworking scholars, and it would be very good if they could create a few inventors. As for the library, since the Eastern Library was looted, it has not been able to recover. This center's ability to expand and establish a large library is also what the times need. The current affairs compilation and periodical index are valuable because they are continuous. Therefore, it is hoped that those who have already started will continue to work hard and that they will be very impressive in the long run. But everything is never satisfied, and if this center has the opportunity to promote other things, my personal opinion is that we must pay attention to cultural arts, especially art history. The scope of culture is very broad, and China can boast of three major inventions, but its progress is not as good as others. What people compliment us on are (1) philosophy, (2) literature, (3) art. China's culture does not yet have a complete history. Some people are now engaged in the history of philosophy and the history of literature, and it is hoped that they will succeed, but very few people are working on art history, because the materials on display are difficult for individuals to handle, so we must rely on the power of the public. I hope that this center will continue the undertakings that have already been started, and devote its remaining energy to this work.</p>

<p>Various Industry Groups and Local Chambers of Commerce: Knowing that the level of knowledge of industrial and commercial service personnel is crucial to business prosperity, they often maintain and promote the progress of various vocational schools. For the sake of business development, the General Association for the Promotion of Industry and Commerce is established in Vienna, the capital of Austria, with branches in various places attached to local chambers of commerce. Vocational schools and the Association for the Promotion of Industry and Commerce often have close cooperation. Schools cultivate service technicians for industry and commerce, while representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors provide guidance on educational policies to the schools. Prominent figures in the industry often give public lectures.</p>
<p>Local vocational schools often have school committees composed of representatives from local industry, commerce, and vocational circles, as well as school principals and teachers, who meet to discuss and seek genuine cooperation between schools and society.</p>
<p>(1) Types of Vocational Schools</p>
<p>Most vocational schools are public, but there are also private ones, mostly women's vocational schools. The Austrian school system has eight years of compulsory primary education, divided into basic schools and senior primary schools, each for four years. After completing eight years of primary school, most students enter schools for agriculture, industry, commerce, or women's home economics. After selection, senior primary school students are divided into groups A and B. Group A students enter secondary schools, while group B students enter vocational schools.</p>
<p>Vocational schools are divided into two levels: higher-level schools, such as senior industrial, agricultural, and commercial schools, and lower-level schools, such as general vocational schools, specialized vocational schools, and women's vocational schools.</p>
<p>General Vocational Schools: These schools focus on training practical knowledge and skills for industrial and commercial service personnel. Their level is equivalent to that of a secondary school. The program is four years. Graduates can enter senior industrial schools or senior commercial schools if their grades are excellent.</p>
<p>Specialized Vocational Schools: Specialized training focuses on teaching the skills of one industry or trade. They can replace apprentice training in factories and shops. The program is three years. However, these schools are not limited to training apprentices. Skilled artisans and craftsmen often become talented through specialized vocational school training.</p>
<p>Foreman Schools are a type of specialized vocational school, specifically training technical management personnel for construction, machinery, electrical, and woodworking factories. The program is four semesters.</p>
<p>Women's Vocational Schools: There are four types of public women's vocational schools: 1. Women's vocational schools, 2. Home economics schools, 3. Sewing schools, 4. Teacher training schools. The admission requirements are that students must have received primary school education and be at least 14 years old. For home economics schools, the age requirement is at least 16 years old. Children of merchants and those with experience are given priority in admission, but all must pass an examination to be admitted. (2) Overview of Vocational Schools</p>
<p>Vienna, as the capital of Austria, is the center of the country's essence and a hub of industry and commerce. Therefore, vocational education is quite developed, with more schools and a wider range of disciplines. The length of study varies greatly, depending on the needs of the discipline. For example, the curriculum for general vocational schools is set at four years, but it can be shortened to two or three years due to the simplicity of the discipline or extended to five years due to the complexity of the discipline. The following schools are well-known vocational schools in Vienna:</p>

<h3>On the Necessary Understanding of International Wireless Stations (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianzuo</p>
<p>For more than fifty years, China's international telecommunications business has been operated by foreign submarine cable companies, resulting in the loss of sovereignty and the outflow of profits, with annual losses exceeding mere tens of thousands! In recent years, with the rise of the wireless business, the National Government of China, in order to safeguard sovereignty and recover losses, established the International Wireless Station. The establishment process and internal situation have been recorded in the fourth issue of this journal and need not be repeated. However, because China's international telecommunications have long been manipulated and controlled by foreigners, the general merchants and people have become accustomed to sending telegrams through submarine cables and lack a deep understanding of the newly emerging state-run International Wireless Station. This is of great importance to the future of the country. Therefore, this article is written to inform the people of the country.</p>
<p>An independent and autonomous country must maintain the integrity of its telecommunications sovereignty. This is because telecommunications are to the country what the blood vessels are to the human body, closely related and not subject to erosion. International telecommunications, as the ears and eyes of the country, are even more important to a country's economy, diplomacy, and military affairs and must be fought for. Our International Wireless Station was born under this situation, hoping to make up for the shortcomings and complete the mission of recovering submarine cable rights.</p>
<p>Now, please allow me to describe the relationship between the International Wireless Station and China's economy, diplomacy, and military affairs so that the concept of benefits and harms will be deeply imprinted in the minds of the people, who will not forget the importance of the station at all times and will strive to assist its development.</p>
<h3>First, let us talk about the economy.</h3>
<p>When a country's international telecommunications are controlled by others, the power to control the telegraph fee is entirely in the hands of others, which goes without saying. The telegraph fees earned by various submarine cable companies in China are mostly taken by the company, with China only sharing a small portion of the remaining profits. This loss is about 8 million yuan per year, totaling nearly 400 million yuan over more than fifty years. This is only the tangible loss. The loss from using this telecommunications equipment to manipulate China's international market is hundreds or thousands of times greater. The International Wireless Station has always negotiated the allocation of telegraph fees with various countries in the spirit of mutual benefit and equality, and the distribution is very fair. Now, a comparison of the allocation of telegraph fees for submarine cable and wireless telegraphs is listed below for reference:</p>
<h3>Comparative Table of International Telegraph Fee Allocation</h3>
<p>Looking at the table above, the difference in the telegraph fees that China should receive between wireless and submarine cables is significant. Now that the International Wireless Station has been established, most countries have abandoned the former and chosen the latter when sending international telegrams. This annual loss of several million yuan can be slightly stopped from now on. This is the relationship between the International Wireless Station and China's national economy.</p>
<h3>New Characters in the Newly Compiled Code</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications published a new edition of the Clear-Secret Code in August of last year, with 138 new characters added, which has been convenient for all sectors since its publication. Now, according to the request of various telegraph bureaus, five more characters are needed, and the Ministry of Communications has ordered all telegraph stations to add them. The codes for the added characters are listed below.</p>

<h3>Official Military Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Urgent as Saving a Fire</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this journal, the reporter compared the transmission of telegrams with the driving of vehicles on the road, finding that the situations were very similar. The official military urgent telegram is like a fire engine. According to the International Telegraph Regulations, official telegrams are classified as first-class. Official telegrams marked as urgent (in fact, there is no such thing as urgent in official telegrams, but Chinese official telegrams always have these words before the text) must be sent in advance.</p>
<p>Official military urgent telegrams have a significant direct impact on politics or military affairs, and indirectly affect domestic security and the lives of the people. The advance sending of telegrams can quell chaos in its infancy and ensure the smooth command. Therefore, urgency is necessary, and the passage of a fire engine is regarded as a matter of life and property, and cannot be delayed. It is said that the situation is the same and the principle is the same. However, during the era of warlord rule, it was selfishly believed that telegrams could be made faster (in fact, telegrams are sent according to regulations and there is no delay). Therefore, regardless of whether the nature was important or whether the telegram was related to public affairs, the word "urgent" was added before the telegram. Later, it progressed rapidly, accumulating and using words such as "extremely urgent," "flying extremely urgent," "one hundred thousand or even one million extremely urgent." As a result, all telegrams were flying and no telegram was not urgent. If we compare this to a fire engine, it is as if fire engines are coming and going on the main roads, charging and ramming, and ordinary vehicles have the suffering of not being able to move. If fire engines are everywhere, the streets will be chaotic. If all official military telegrams are flying extremely urgent, is this a good phenomenon?</p>
<p>Now, let us use the car as an analogy again. Fire engines are only suitable for putting out fires and should not be used to carry passengers. Similarly, official military telegrams should only be related to public affairs and should not involve private matters. Therefore, a telegram that is official in name but private in reality is no different from a fire engine that does not put out fires but carries passengers privately. Now, the political and military authorities are different from before. Once the Ministry of Communications implements measures to crack down on official military private telegrams, they will be able to consider the situation and understand the principles, so that the telegraph lines can be cleared up.</p>
<h3>Telephone Line Components</h3>
<p>— Wang Qikun</p>
<p>The components of telephone lines, whether for urban or long-distance use, differ in quality, using either iron or copper wire, and in quantity, using either single or double wires.</p>
<p>Iron wire is inexpensive and sturdy, making it more economical; however, its electrical resistance is higher and it has a skin effect, making it unsuitable for voice currents. Copper wire is the opposite, so except in special circumstances, copper wire is typically used for telephone lines. In long-distance telephony, due to the long distances involved, the conductivity of voice current is particularly important, so the use of copper wire is also the principle.</p>
<p>If telephones use a single wire with the earth as a return path, the initial costs can be reduced by almost half. However, earth communication often produces earth currents, which can affect the call. Furthermore, electric trams, power lines, electric lights, etc., often have one end of their return circuits connected to the earth, and the leakage current can infiltrate telephone lines and disrupt calls. Therefore, double-wire systems are suitable for ordinary urban telephone lines, and single-wire systems are especially unsuitable for long-distance telephones that pass through several cities.</p>
<p>The use of double wires for long-distance telephones has the following additional benefits: (1) Double current operation (simultaneous telephone and telegraph communication) can be adopted, which could facilitate combined telegraph transmission and reception, or allow the telephone line to be used as an auxiliary line. The so-called use as an auxiliary line means that two operators can switch to telegraphy when communicating, to increase the efficiency of the telephone line. (2) It can be converted into a phantom circuit, where two pairs of wires can be used as three pairs, four pairs of wires can be used as six pairs—even used as seven pairs of telephone lines and one pair of telegraph lines; with wider paths, transmission can be accelerated. (3) Carrier systems can be used to make one pair of wires serve as four to sixteen pairs, increasing the utilization of the telephone line.</p>
<p>Looking at the long-distance telephone lines in various parts of the country, those used for military purposes mostly use single-wire iron wire, while those operated by provinces or businesses use double-wire copper wire, but many also use single-wire iron wire. Those operated by the Ministry of Communications—such as Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Beijing-Tianjin, Qingdao-Jinan—are all double-wire copper wire, and Beijing-Shanghai even adopts double current operation and phantom circuits, becoming a good friend of wired and wireless telegraphy.</p>
<p>Based on the components of long-distance telephone lines in various locations, it is not difficult to infer their service performance. Furthermore, the electrical communication business must meet the following conditions in order to fully demonstrate its effectiveness: (1) speed, (2) accuracy, (3) stability and reliability, (4) low cost, (5) simple procedures, (6) ability to supply large quantities of needs, and (7) maintaining secrecy. Among the electrical communication businesses, only well-equipped long-distance telephones can fully meet these seven conditions.</p>
<h3>Installation of Wired Telegraph Lines in the Past Year (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Qian Jiaguang</p>
<p>Expanded Line Routes</p>
<p>(1) Overview: Existing lines should be repaired, and transportation development should be expanded. Given the vastness and abundance of our country, communication equipment should not be restricted for long. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications is making every effort to repair trunk and branch lines, and at the same time, considering the people, expanding the lines as needed, and developing the communication scope with construction. Generally, the lines added in the 22nd year can be divided into two categories for explanation.</p>
<p>(A) Pertaining to the Bandit Suppression Area—Localities that have become bandit areas have had previous construction completely destroyed. Central troops are constantly advancing to suppress bandits and recover various places, and communication should be restored urgently so that people can rest and recuperate, news can be mutually transmitted, and troop movements can be facilitated.</p>
<p>(B) Pertaining to Business Needs! Inland cities are developing commerce, but telegraph offices have not yet been established. Round-trip telegrams to major trading ports require traveling thousands of miles to send them to nearby offices for transmission, or having nearby offices deliver them by special messengers. This is both inconvenient and time-consuming. Alternatively, the original lines were not sufficient to handle the busy telegram traffic. To meet the needs of the people, it is necessary to expand the lines or add to existing lines.</p>
<p>(2) Statistics: According to the above situation, the expansion of the lines should be divided into two categories: "newly installed lines" and "added wires". The so-called "added wires" means adding additional wires to existing roads to increase efficiency in actual communication. Combining the above two expansions, a total of 3,197 kilometers were completed in the past year. There is also a newly installed underwater line from Datong in Anhui Province to Heyuezhou, with a length of 2,000 feet. The details can be seen below.</p>
<p>(A) Newly Installed Lines—Total length is 2,104 kilometers: Qishui to Yingshan 78 kilometers; Huang'an to Hekouzhen 25 kilometers; Tianjin to Xianshuigu 33 kilometers; Xianshuigu to Gegu 12 kilometers; Daye County seat to Xialu 14 kilometers; Tianjin to Liangwangzhuang 52 kilometers; Jiapu to Dongtang 10 kilometers; Dushan to Liusaitang 104 kilometers; Xing'an to Guanyang 115 kilometers; Tianjin to Dagu 142 kilometers; Fancheng to Zaoyang 86 kilometers; Daokou to Daming 124 kilometers; Yancheng to Guanjia Guan 60 kilometers; Fuzhou to Zhenbian 63 kilometers; Luoyang to Meng County 73 kilometers; Wuxue to Huangmei 69 kilometers; Jianggan to Fuyang 34 kilometers; Pingyuan to Xunwu 121 kilometers; Xiajiang to Jibing 69 kilometers; Xiali River to Jixian 12 kilometers; Longqu to Suichang 69 kilometers; Guangzhou to Shangcheng 55 kilometers; Yongfeng to Anle 58 kilometers; Anle to Chongren 81 kilometers; Shuikou to Gutian 69 kilometers; Fuzhou to Chongren 52 kilometers; Fuzhou to Yihuang 75 kilometers; Niukou to Wushan 81 kilometers; Fuzhou to Jinxi 58 kilometers; Pucheng via Longquan to Qingyuan 210 kilometers.</p>
<p>(B) Added Wires—Total length is 1,093 kilometers: Wuxi to Jiangyin 40 kilometers; Wushan to Kuizhou 69 kilometers; Huzhou to Jiapu 59 kilometers; Hejigang to Daye 71 kilometers; Caidian to Shashi 276 kilometers; Beiping to Yutian 119 kilometers; Beiping to Tangshan 35 kilometers; Beiping to Zhangjiakou 243 kilometers; Hangzhou to Chang'an 52 kilometers; Dezhou to Yancheng 89 kilometers.</p>
<h3>Discussing the Convenience of Sending Telegrams in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ji Qing</p>
<p>Bureau Stations and Receiving/Dispatching Branches</p>
<p>Total 19 Locations</p>
<p>Nowadays, sending a telegram is truly very convenient. Because telegraph bureaus or wireless stations in various locations, in addition to receiving and dispatching telegrams at their own bureau stations, have also added receiving/dispatching branches or receiving stations in busy and convenient locations, in order to facilitate telegram sending for people who are further away. Then, people who send telegrams do not necessarily have to go to the telegraph bureau or wireless station; they can send telegrams at the nearby receiving/dispatching branch or receiving station, and they can also quickly reach all parts of the world or the country.</p>
<p>We who live in Shanghai feel that sending telegrams is even more convenient than elsewhere. Because the international radio stations, telegraph bureaus, wireless stations, the receiving/dispatching branches of various bureau stations, and the various receiving stations attached to the Shanghai Bank and its branches, as well as the various submarine line receiving/dispatching stations, large and small, number nearly twenty. They are scattered everywhere, like stars in the sky, so that there is a bureau every five steps, a station across the street, a receiving/dispatching branch around the corner, and a receiving station across the street. Therefore, sending telegrams is truly very convenient!</p>
<p>Now, in order to let everyone know the locations of the various bureau stations, receiving/dispatching branches, and receiving stations, I will list them one by one (see above in this publication) so that everyone can check them at any time.</p>
<p>All telegraph bureaus, wireless stations, receiving/dispatching branches, and receiving stations are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications. All staff members have strict orders from the ministry to operate commercially, implement measures for the public, and act politely. If they put on airs of being officials, are perfunctory in their work, or are impolite to senders and receivers, then please report them to the supervisors without hesitation, so that they will be strictly investigated and dealt with, and efforts will be made to improve.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in Overseas Wireless Radio</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>Anglo-French Aviation Shortwave Communication</p>
<p>For the sake of maintaining the safety of civil aviation, the aviation departments of the United Kingdom and France have specifically installed ultra-shortwave radio transceivers between the Lympne and Angleville aviation stations on both sides of the English Channel for liaison communication. The distance between the two stations is approximately 35 miles. The wavelength used is approximately seven inches. The results of the bilateral tests were very satisfactory. This ultra-shortwave communication not only avoids various interferences in the air, but also guarantees the confidentiality and stability of communication. It is reported that this route of communication was officially opened on January 26 of this year. At present, the business is limited to receiving and dispatching telegrams reporting the departure and arrival times of aircraft.</p>
<h3>Mackay Company's Newly Established Radio Stations</h3>
<p>The new Chicago, New Orleans, and Seattle radio stations established by the American Mackay Radio Telegraph Company opened for communication in December of last year. Together with the original four stations in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Portland, there are now a total of seven domestic radio stations. The company and Postal Telegraph are both affiliated companies of International Telephone &amp; Telegraph (ITT) Corporation, and the two parties have always adopted a cooperative approach in their business. Therefore, if the customers of Postal Telegraph want to send telegrams to the above-mentioned seven locations, they can all be transmitted by Mackay Company's radio stations. Mackay Company started operating domestic wireless radio business in 1911. At that time, radio stations were established in major cities along the Pacific coast to receive and dispatch commercial reports. It was not until 1914 that marine communication between the United States and the Hawaiian Islands was started. The current international wireless radio routes can directly reach Denmark, Hungary, Austria, the Vatican, Spain, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Cuba, Hawaii, the Philippines, and China.</p>

<p>Establishment of Sweden's Largest Radio Broadcasting Station</p>
<p>The Swedish Telegraph Bureau requested the government to allocate 1.4 million Krona (1 Krona equals US$0.267) from the construction fund for the reconstruction of the Motala broadcasting station. The existing power of the station is 30 kilowatts, which can be increased to 150 kilowatts in the future, making it the largest radio station in Sweden. (London Electrical Review)</p>
<p>Hungary's Tallest Antenna Radio Station</p>
<p>The new 120-kilowatt radio station in Budapest has already been opened. Its cigar-shaped radio mast reaches a height of 314 meters, making it the tallest antenna in the world. All components are dual (even crystal oscillators) for emergency needs. The lowest level of the station has four 120-kilowatt gates for propulsion. There is also a special electric button that can cut off the entire power supply in one second in an emergency. (London Electrical Review)</p>
<p>Installation of Swiss Telephone Trunk Lines</p>
<p>The Swiss government has recently been engaged in rebuilding telephone trunk lines in the Valais region that have been stalled for many years. This line runs along the banks of Lake Geneva, across the Rhone plain, to Brig, for a total length of approximately 97 miles. It will be connected to the new Lotschberg Tunnel's telephone submarine lines, and then connected to the Italian telephone lines at Iselle via the Italian key, so that the underground cable between Geneva and Milan can be completed for telephone calls. (London Electrical Review)</p>
<p>Connection of North-South Telephone Lines in the Federated Malay States</p>
<p>The direct telephone line between the British Federated Malay States and Singapore and the northern border of Malaya will be established on November 1. At that time, the existing federal trunk lines will be extended to Kedah and Perlis, which are not part of the Federated Malay States in the northern border of Malaya, so that telephone calls will be possible between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. (Report from the US Commercial Attaché in Singapore)</p>
<p>Progress of Automatic Telephones in Germany</p>
<p>According to the Post Office, there are currently only eleven automatic telephone exchanges installed in Berlin. This new type of telephone started construction in 1926 and will be completed in 1935.

<p>The Japanese Sumitomo Electric Wire &amp; Cable Co. was ordered by the Ministry of Communications to establish a submarine cable manufacturing plant in Shirinashi, southwest of Osaka (where 10,000-ton vessels can be docked) in February of the year before last. The plant site covers a total of 3,600 tsubo (approximately three acres), of which 1,400 tsubo (approximately one acre) are for factory offices and ancillary buildings. Its machinery can manufacture various insulated submarine cables. This is the only factory in Japan that manufactures submarine cables, and Japan is now able to manufacture these submarine cables independently without having to rely on foreigners. The first products of the factory were submarine cables for the Taiwan local government to connect seven nautical miles, and later, several Tokyo Bay telephone submarine cables and a 57-nautical-mile telephone submarine cable in the Korean Strait were installed for the Japanese government. Currently, it is undertaking the manufacture of various types of custom submarine cables, with a total length of approximately several hundred nautical miles. (Far Eastern Review)</p>

<p>Postal Remittance Bureau's Fee Collection Methods for Telegraphic Transfers</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate communication for the public and save expenses, previously instructed the relevant postal and telegraph authorities to consult on cooperative measures. In addition to the joint establishment of postal and telegraph bureaus and the exemption of postage for postal transfers of telegrams, which have been recorded in the previous issue of this publication, there is also a method for collecting fees for telegraphic transfers issued by postal remittance bureaus, which has also been agreed upon and will be implemented from March 15. The main points of the method are extracted and recorded below:</p>
<p>1. For telegraphic transfers issued by the Postal Savings Remittance General Branch and post offices concurrently handling savings and remittance business, regardless of whether the telegram text is in Chinese or foreign languages, clear or coded, a flat fee of six jiao (silver yuan) will be charged for each telegram within 20 characters. For each character exceeding the limit, an additional five fen (silver yuan) will be charged.</p>
<p>2. If these telegraphic transfers need to be sent as urgent telegrams, the above-mentioned prices should be doubled. If checking is required, half the fee should be added.</p>
<p>3. These telegraphic transfers should be marked with "MDT" before the name, address, and place name of the recipient, and counted as one character for billing purposes.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned fee collection method for telegraphic transfers is only applicable to those issued by postal remittance bureaus. Telegraphic transfers issued by other banks will still be charged at ordinary prices. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications has given a special discount for telegraphic transfers issued by postal remittance bureaus because, firstly, from March 15, the postage for postal transfers of telegrams will be exempted. Secondly, the various remittances received by postal remittance bureaus are mostly less than 100 yuan. In order to facilitate the public, the fees for telegraphic transfers have been reduced, so that the general public can quickly remit funds in urgent need by spending a few jiao on telegram fees.</p>

<h3>Financial Swap Day: Gold Market Mediocre and Unremarkable</h3>
<p>May Term Chips Exceed 17,000</p>
<p>Swap from Bulls Offering Seven Yuan or So</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday encountered swaps, resulting in a firmer market situation. The situation was stable and mostly sideways throughout the day. At the beginning of the morning, overseas Britain and America were both flat, and the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange was slightly compressed. Although the exchange rate rose slightly, the price of London raw gold fell by one and a half pence. American cotton rose in the near term and fell in the far term, but the amount was small. American wheat shrank by 1.25. The opening of the raw disk was stable. Initially, the bank scooped up the far term and filled the near term. The exchange rate was flat and quiet. Later, the internal disk showed a slight tightening, once breaking out of 50 yuan. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) listed prices for Britain and America did not fluctuate, and the banks were still supplying, still falling back, but the situation was circling, and the difference was minimal. The market situation was mediocre in the morning, and buying and selling were balanced, because the market will soon be swapped. In the afternoon, the foreign electricity reported that the night market of futures silver in Seattle fell by more than sixty pounds, and the swap was pre-made, with the short side adding to the offering of about eight yuan, and breaking out of the 50 yuan mark. After the opening, the exchange rate was mediocre, still retreating into the 50 yuan mark. Later, the swap price fell, people's hearts were confused, and large households violently sold strips and fell even more. The trend for the day was mediocre, and the price of red gold was 961.5 yuan. The opening of the swap market this term was seven yuan offered by the buyer. Now the market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 947.7 yuan, up 0.7 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at the same price. The exchange rate opened with the recent selling price of British Exchange at one shilling, four pence, five six two five; British Exchange at 35.1875 yuan. At the start of the market, the exchange rate was calm due to the bank scooping up the far term and filling the near term. Later, McCarey scooped up US dollars for June at 625, and Da Changxiang, Hengxing, Hengyu, Sheng Dayi, Da Yong, etc. bought in succession, rising to 50.02 yuan. It was expected that HSBC's listed prices would not change. Hongli goods sold strips, and McCarey came out with US dollars for April at 25, retreating to 9 yuan. At this time, Tianfeng, Hengchang, Yong, etc. were also buying in, and there was still a struggle. However, De Kang worked hard to press down, and Yuan Chun, Yi Feng, and Yong also sold, and the bank had once filled US dollars for July at 6875, falling to 8.5 yuan.

After entering, the swaps were small. Large households such as Da Decheng, Yuan Mao Yong, etc. continued to sell. Although Da Xing Yong bought in, Wan Xing also sold, and the situation gradually fell, dropping to 8.2 yuan. The closing price was 948.3 yuan, and the goods were auctioned at 8.7 yuan.

As a result, it rose by 1.3 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was not changed because HSBC's US exchange rate was not listed, still calculated at 34.75 yuan, combined with the standard gold price of over 995 yuan, and the implied pressure based on the closing price was about 47 yuan, which was 1 yuan less than the previous close. The settlement price for March was 705 yuan due to the unchanged listing of the shilling, combined with the exchange rate and standard gold price, and the implied pressure based on the closing price was about 2 yuan, which was more than 2 yuan less than before. The book value for this month was 702 yuan, and for April it was 949 yuan. The water replenishment in the morning was 702 yuan, and in the afternoon it was 703 yuan.

In the afternoon, the Tianjin gang sold 120 taels to Yingfeng Heng, at 960.6 yuan, about an additional 11 yuan. The central appetite was still sluggish, and transactions were generally made at the futures price.</p>
<p>The trading in the field was flat. In summary, Wan Xing, Shunli, Da Decheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Fuyu, Yuan Chun, Bing Xing, Yongde, Tong Chun, Ding Chang, and Dekang were on the selling side.

Shunli made a total of more than 600,轧out more than 100. The Guangdong gang Shengda bought and sold more than 100 each. Hengxing bought more than 200 and sold more than 100. The market was quiet in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The March period was silent and motionless after the opening, delaying for quite a long time. Later, Cheng Kang sold 91 shares to Zhengchang for 1.5 yuan. The morning opening was then 701.5 yuan, an increase of 7 jiao from the previous close. Finally, Yidayong came to buy in, and Xiangfeng sold 42 shares, rising to 2 yuan. The afternoon closing was 702 yuan. There were still no opponents in the afternoon, and after struggling, only Xiangfeng sold 63 shares to Qianchangxiang for 3 yuan. The opening was 703 yuan. Tianfeng also wanted to sell at this price, but there was no transaction after that, so it was delayed until the closing, still at 703 yuan. It was found that the highest price for the day was 703 yuan, and the lowest was 701.5 yuan, with a difference of 1.5 yuan. As a result, it rose by 2.2 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The swap (April swap May) began before 1:30 in the afternoon. Initially, the bull side was offered 6.5 to 7 yuan. There were not many transactions at this time. Although Wan Xing and Qianchangxiang had swapped out, the short side was extremely eager, and immediately added to 7.7 yuan. There were more transactions at this time. Large households such as Dafeng Heng Hongxing Fuyu offered in, and Zhifengyong Hongli Yifengyong, etc. offered out in succession. When Hengyu Zhifengyong Yifengyong Dingchang Huixiang Yuan Mao Yong Da Cheng Fuyu Shengda Ruixing Qianchangxiang Hengtai, etc. offered out one after another, the offering price gradually increased, rising to 8 yuan. The Dalian gang and Bing Xing then came to swap out. After entering, the Dalian gang Huiyuan Qianchangxiang Yongde Qingfa Yong came to offer in, and retreated to 7.7 yuan. However, Yuan Maoyong Hengyu Zhengchang Yidayong Tianfeng Yong, etc. were still offering out, and there was still a struggle.

<h3>Interbank Call Loans Remain Easy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the market became increasingly bleak. The interbank call loan rate remained free in the morning and afternoon, and clearing fees were also waived. The market's sluggishness was unparalleled. In the call loan market, over 4.5 million yuan was transferred in the morning and over 300,000 yuan in new transactions. In the afternoon, there were over 400,000 yuan in transactions, and over 300,000 yuan in transactions at the Small General Association. Bank collections and settlements were also very quiet. Yesterday's collection and settlement situation was vastly different compared to Monday and Tuesday of this week. Yesterday, foreign banks collected and settled over 1.6 million yuan in bills, over 3.3 million yuan in various goods, exchange margin deposits, and miscellaneous funds, and 100,000 yuan was released from warehouses. Chinese banks collected and settled over 2.5 million yuan in bills, over 4.56 million yuan in various goods, exchange margin deposits, tax payments, and miscellaneous expenses, and 200,000 yuan was released from warehouses.

Overall, yesterday's collection and settlement situation seemed to be more than one-third less than Monday and Tuesday. Although there was some activity in settling exchange bills, the lack of strength in imported goods meant there were no significant mutual trade transactions. Money shops collected and settled over 34 million yuan in foreign public notes, over 4.2 million yuan in foreign clearing fees, over 400,000 yuan in various remittance fees, and 2-300,000 yuan in cash.

<h3>Continued Fall in Guangjiao, Extension of Copper Coin Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no change in Jiangnan small silver coins, remaining the same as the previous day at 810 yuan. Trading volume was 5,000 jiao in the morning and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon.

<h3>Bond Market Shows Signs of Activity as Settlement Date Approaches</h3>
<p>—Market Slightly Firmer, Showing Signs of Rising—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a slightly stronger market. Some people believed that the Japanese attitude towards Chahar seemed unstable again, and that the market might ease. The insensitivity of market prices was also due to short sellers slightly rolling over their positions. Although the number was not large, the trend relied on firmness. It is evident that the current situation still places importance on the different supply and demand of chips. At the opening in the morning, scattered short sellers and No. 75 short sellers rolled over their positions, but with limitations, unwilling to ease market prices, so their bidding was very firm, with a slight upward trend of about one or two jiao. From the second session to the close, although the fluctuations were small, the trend was extremely stable and slightly bullish. Compared to before, it seemed to be slightly more active. Measuring its shape, its volatility should gradually show signs of activity, as the settlement date gradually approaches. As a result, market prices uniformly returned by one to four jiao. The total transaction volume was 4,933,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot goods and 4,930,000 yuan in futures. The comparison table of high and low fluctuations is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Mixed Performance in New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>According to a report from the New Feng Foreign Firm, the New York stock market on the 14th showed mixed results, slightly higher overall. Railroad freight transportation continued to increase, the St. Lawrence Seaway Treaty failed to pass in the Senate, and positive commercial news outweighed negative news. However, steel production did not expand due to the automobile industry strike. The New York State government threatened to restrict public utility companies, leading bulls to close positions slightly. The small exchange market was firm, with bond prices reaching new highs, especially for industrial companies, railroads, and speculative public utility companies. High-grade bonds and U.S. government bonds were also firm, while foreign government bonds were mixed. The total daily trading volume was 1.36 million shares. The wheat market was stable with slightly increased trading and better news. The harvest was light, and news from the Southwest favored bulls. Cotton futures trading was dull, while spot trading was firm due to the proposal to reduce factory work to 30 hours per week. However, prices were firm and stable. Opposition was expected in Congress to preferential cotton loans to the Soviet Union. According to various reports, American farmers were planting cotton in Mexico because the government's restrictions could not reach abroad. U.S. cotton consumption in February totaled 477,900 bales. The Dow Jones futures indices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Local Cotton Mills to Reduce Working Hours Starting June 1st</h3>

<p>The yarn market saw a strong upward trend in the morning due to the successful conclusion of the factory meeting the previous day, which resulted in a uniform reduction of working hours starting June 1st. This caused scattered short sellers to panic and rush to buy in to cover their positions, further fueling the upward trend. However, rumors circulated in the market in the afternoon that the British Jardine Matheson factory had released 3-4,000 pieces of 20-count Five Blessings brand yarn, but the price and buyers had not yet been announced, slightly impacting and weakening the market.</p>
<h3>Standard Yarn Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the forenoon, advancing on the previous day's firmness, with short covering activities, each month rising between 0.27 and 1.12 yuan.

<p>Shantou 10 Ningbo 2</p>
<h3>Extremely Quiet Standard Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market was flat and weak, lacking vitality, and in a desolate state. Overseas cotton markets were extremely soft. Indian cotton was becoming increasingly weak due to increased inventories, and prices were becoming weaker. The local cotton market should have fallen, but it was supported by the rising yarn market. Talk of factory production cuts was rampant. The future of the cotton market was weaker than that of the yarn market.</p>
<h3>Standard Zheng Cotton Stays Quiet</h3>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the forenoon, rising slightly with the yarn market, but then fell back due to poor conditions of foreign cotton. Each month fell by 0.05 yuan. The afternoon was flat, with the middle month rising by 0.05 yuan, and no significant changes in other months. The total trading volume for the day was 39,600 dan. Upon investigation, Dafu sold 1,200 dan, Huikang 3,300 dan, Yichang 1,400 dan, Changhe 1,300 dan, Taixing 2,700 dan, and Xincheng 1,200 dan. Tongfu bought 600 dan, Chungi 4,000 dan, Yuande 1,200 dan, and Ruida 1,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<h3>Slight Factory Demand</h3>
<p>The demand for spot cotton was dull. Factories had a slight appetite. Yao cotton arrived at 190 bales. Spot cotton prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 41.25 Also 41.75 Yong'an Factory purchased 300 pieces Spot Delivery to the Factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 47.75 Dakang Factory purchased 162 pieces Also Also</p>
<p>East American Type 44.75 Shanghai Factory purchased 100 pieces Also Also</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton 38.50 Zhenxin Factory purchased 300 bales Spot Delivery to Wuxi</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Market Gloomy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was dull and unremarkable. Traders took a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, spot prices did not change, and futures were firm near-term and weak long-term, rising or falling by 1 to 5 points. Liverpool spot cotton fell by 2 points, and futures fell by 23 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to speculators selling, but then rose again due to demand for spot goods from Japanese traders. As a result, Pinggar, Ormla, and both rose by 1 rupee, and Bailuoxi rose by 0.75 rupees. The original telegram recorded the following (telegram on the 14th):</p>

<h3>Dullness in the Flour Futures Market</h3>
<p>—Not Many Sellers, Outcome Still Flat—</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, the market for each month presented a state of initial stability followed by weakness. Quotations for foreign wheat were around 48 points below for Chicago and 0.20 yuan below for Canadian wheat. At the opening, because the market had more upward momentum, the opening prices for each month were slightly better by 0.005-0.01 yuan compared to the previous day. Later, because actual sales were inactive and small factories only made a few accommodation sales, the market turned flat again. In the afternoon opening, the market in each month generally hovered, but because sellers were not smooth, the outcome slightly rebounded. However, transactions in each session were extremely quiet. In recent markets, vitality has been lacking, the main reason being the dryness of the economy in various regions and lack of purchasing power, and artificial manipulations are ineffective. As a result, the current month was slightly lower by 0.025 yuan, April was slightly better by 0.05 yuan, May and June were unchanged, and July and August were better by 0.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lacking Activity in Forward Wheat Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for forward wheat remained extremely quiet. Although foreign wheat quotations were still slightly lower by 48 points to 0.20 yuan, the standard situation ultimately lacked significant changes. The market for the current month was already softened due to the inclusion of foreign wheat. In the context of sluggish flour sales, although squeezing shorts was successful, there was no real benefit. Moreover, those with foreign wheat could take the opportunity to sell it off. Forward contracts lacked activity in both buying and selling because the prospect of domestic wheat harvests was uncertain. The result was that the current month was slightly lower by 0.02 yuan, and all others were unchanged. Spot wheat was not traded because factory demand had stopped.</p>
<h3>Sales of Late Rice Continue, Up 0.05 Yuan</h3>
<p>—All Heavy Geng Stays the Same—</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 40 traders and over 6,000 shih of supplies. The market initially remained sluggish, but fortunately, visiting merchants gradually arrived, tightening the situation. As a result, the current flat situation was maintained. The market prices for commonly traded Su Tong, Nanhang, and other Geng rice showed no change. However, the buying interest from out-of-town traders began with the Beiyang traders from Tianjin, Yantai, etc., and then the Nanyang and Xiamen traders followed suit, making the market seem to rise. However, the Nanyang traders suddenly stopped, only purchasing 3-400 bags, thus affecting the market tone. Sellers were forced to lower prices slightly. After hovering like this for about half an hour, fortunately, the Beiyang traders continued to purchase, making it turn slightly better. By the close, the statistics showed that the Beiyang and Nanyang traders purchased a total of two shiploads of thick Geng rice, and 3,300-3,400 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and Fengjing Nanhang late rice, thus allowing the late rice market price to continue to rise by 0.05 yuan. Du Yangjiansales were still acceptable and remained stable. The sales of Yinbian Yuandian were slightly better, but the market did not show strength.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 47-48 traders of various goods from Hexia, and the sales of various goods in the market were slightly active. The market for Bai Geng was flat in the morning and settled in the afternoon. The price of early thin rice was reduced by several points. Yang Du, Bu Ke, Jian Bian, and Yin Yuan had no significant changes.</p>
<h3>Xiang Rice Sells Well, Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>—Foreign Rice Price Reductions Sought to Sell—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the Xiang rice market was excellent. Because production prices have been rising recently, the source has been gradually reduced. The Xiang provincial authorities have begun to collect and store 500,000 bags of rough rice in warehouses, and the cost of Xiang province rough rice will gradually increase. Traders in the local market immediately shouted for a price increase of 0.2 yuan, but the inventory in the market was still sufficient, and there were also goods arriving from other provinces, so the market price failed to rise fully. As a result, it continued to rise by 0.12-0.13 yuan and 0.06-0.07 yuan respectively. Other mechanically processed rough rice followed suit. When the market price was first increased in the morning, purchases were still slow, but after the cargo owners slightly lowered the price in the afternoon, traders from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces began to inquire. The appetite of the Fuzhou and Quanzhou traders in Fujian province and the Ningbo and Wenzhou traders in Zhejiang province was greedier. There were also sales to the mainland. Yesterday, the Yongbo traders were greedier, purchasing more than 4,000 bags. The sales interest of other routes was still high, but the rise was too fast, and it was feared that it was not worth transporting. The total number of various mechanically processed rough Xiang rice sold all day was 9,832 bags. One thousand bags of small quantity foreign rice were opened, and 2,500 bags in secret trading. The initial price was 6.7 yuan, then 6.67 yuan, and the lowest price was 6.65 yuan. 1,000 bags were purchased from Ningbo, and the rest were purchased by local street shops. This price was lower than the previous price, because the cargo owners intended to reduce the price in order to sell.</p>
<h3>Soybean Factories Trade Intermittently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was first soft and then tight. Factories bought and sold in the morning intermittently. The situation still lacked prosperity. Because the buying price was limited and factories only took small quantities of goods, it was difficult to develop for a while. Yesterday, the factory bought about 7,000 bags of Henan Guide Dangshan soybeans, with a market price of 2.5 yuan. An oil workshop in Jiangbei purchased three cars of Linhuaiguan soybeans, with a price of 2.33 yuan. In addition, traders in the local street bought about four or five cars of various round beans for export.</p>
<h3>Black Melon Seeds in North-South Goods Sell Weakly, Price Drops</h3>
<p>Black melon seeds have abundant inventory, sluggish sales, and the market price has dropped by 1 yuan. The current sales price is listed below:</p>
<p>Dangshan Seeds 12.2 yuan Minguang Seeds 9.5 yuan</p>
<p>Xu Kui Seeds 11.5 yuan Zhongmu Seeds 8.8 yuan</p>
<p>Xu Zhong Seeds 11 yuan Liaoyang Seeds 11.5 yuan</p>
<p>Ji Kui Seeds 15.5 yuan Haicheng Seeds 11 yuan</p>
<p>Ji Zhong Seeds 14.5 yuan Liuhe Seeds 12.2 yuan</p>
<h3>More than a Thousand Bags of Hainan Red Sugar Opened in the Sugar Market</h3>
<p>—The Market Is Still Difficult to Be Optimistic About—</p>
<p>The sugar market was sluggish, and the guild barely made any trades. Only Hainan red sugar, due to action by the Yantai traders, opened more than a thousand bags, with a price of 13.3-13.4 yuan, which was 0.1-0.2 yuan lower than before. Although Shantou traders were asking for 13 yuan, there were no buyers. With the current congested inventory, it is still difficult to revitalize the market.</p>
<h3>Sales of Cloth, Woolen Goods, and Sichuan Goods are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Woolen goods and fabrics are currently selling well, and the number of daily shipments by traders has been increasing, with a stable market trend. However, the Sichuan traders have been slow to act, which is a shame. This is due to tight credit conditions and the upcoming increase in postal parcel taxes. The recent purchase interest of the traders has been slight. Most traders have to receive letters from their superiors before they can make small purchases, lacking the power to independently make purchases. According to experienced traders, there may be a group buying spree in ten days, but most of the light fabrics for spring sales will not be able to make it in time.</p>

<h3>Head Sacrifice to Spirits</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>Westerners, even towards their enemies after death, always express a certain respect. Therefore, between people, when encountering irreconcilable feuds, as long as they can defeat their enemies, they no longer haggle over it, and rarely seek revenge on the dead. Moreover, their approach to revenge is only "an eye for an eye," never involving many innocent people.</p>
<p>But in China, things are vastly different: towards enemies, even if they are dead, they cannot be forgiven; Wu Zixu whipping the corpse became a beautiful tale of revenge for all time. Although this is relatively rare, we can easily find similar examples in ordinary books: cutting grass to eradicate roots, killing the enemy's chickens and dogs without leaving any alive. During the Spring and Autumn period, the conflict between the Tu and Zhao families was caused by the loss of an infant less than one year old, and they even wanted to kill all infants of the same age in the city to eliminate future troubles. And usually, after slicing the enemy into a thousand pieces, it is still not enough to vent their anger; they must also sacrifice the bloody heads before the spirits of those who have been dead for many years to feel satisfied.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Chinese attitude towards enemies is also different from that of Westerners. When we read Nordic novels, we often see stories of revenge, but although they hate their enemies, they also respect them. The stronger the opponent, the more they respect them. When the enemy is about to die, they seem to have reached an understanding of friendship with each other, and there will never be any destruction of the enemy's corpse to relieve hatred. Because they respect their enemies, their means of revenge are always honorable and upright, standing in a position of mutual struggle. In China, it is just the opposite. If the enemy is strong, the feud may not be avenged for the time being, and they may even fawn and flatter him, becoming the enemy's running dog; but if the enemy is weak, they will try all kinds of despicable and filthy means to completely eradicate them.</p>
<p>The Chinese attitude of revenge precisely expresses the two special qualities of the Chinese nation, on the one hand, it shows shameful cowardice, and on the other hand, it shows inhumane cruelty. Moreover, from these special qualities of the Chinese nation, which combine cowardice and cruelty, we can better understand why the spirit of "beating a drowning dog" is particularly developed among the Chinese.</p>
<h3>Twilight Recital</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The bleak twilight paints a remote mountain path; a sedan chair hastily passes through an ancient teahouse. Wisps of green smoke float around the steep mountain peaks, and a few crows fly gracefully into the secluded green pine forest. An elderly woodcutter, carrying two bundles of dry firewood, gasps for breath, slowly walking into a dilapidated bamboo gate!</p>
<h3>A Stroll in the Confucian Temple</h3>
<p>— Zi Ge</p>
<p>There was a period, about two years ago, when I walked in the Confucian Temple almost every day. Of course, "every day" is an average. Actually, sometimes I would go several times a day, and sometimes I wouldn't go for several days.</p>
<p>At that time, I lived next door to the Confucian Temple, separated by an alley called Que Li. During the day, besides doing my own work, I also had to observe the faces of the people who ate and worked with me. At night, my room was always surrounded by young people who were the same age as me or even older, making it suffocating, and there was nowhere to escape. So, I could only sneak into the Confucian Temple for a walk in the morning or evening to get a chance to take a few deep breaths of fresh air.</p>
<p>To get to the Confucian Temple, you could only enter through the side gates on both sides. For the sake of convenience, we always entered from the side gate of the Kong family mansion along Que Li Road. As soon as you entered the gate, you would see many turtle-like objects lying on the ground, with large steles more than ten feet high on their backs. They were all carved from very solid stone, but they couldn't help but make people feel a little pitiful. So, colleagues often pointed at them and joked to others, "How pitiful you are!" At the same time, I also learned that the young people there liked to scold people for being slow by saying, "You are being pressed by a big stele!"</p>
<p>Going up to the right, through a large gate, you could look up and see the Dacheng Hall. Walking down the stone steps, what lies in front of you is the Apricot Platform, said to be where Confucius taught. Right below the stone steps, on the left side, opposite the Apricot Platform, is a long stele inscribed with the five characters "The Former Teacher Planted Cypress," next to which stands a cypress tree, with a section of withered tree trunk framed in glass on the side, said to be the cypress tree planted by Confucius himself, and the living tree is derived from it. The Apricot Platform is a square pavilion with a few small apricot trees in front of it. Only one leaning tree is considered old. I saw them blossom and bear fruit. I picked the apricots to eat, but they didn't taste sweet, so I guess they were newly planted. In the middle of the Apricot Platform, there is something like a bell hanging, said to be the wooden tongue, which sounds good when struck, but one cannot help but suspect that this is an association produced by the sentence "Heaven will take the master as a wooden tongue." Walking straight up, you will reach the front door of the Dacheng Hall. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Cold Water Literature</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>When people are excitedly engrossed in something or someone, if someone suddenly makes a penetrating remark to spoil their enthusiasm, in our hometown, this is called "pouring cold water." Pouring a bucket of cold water into a boiling pot can stop the boiling, and even make the heat disappear completely. Enthusiastic young people are not afraid of fierce enemies or repeated setbacks, but they are most afraid of a spoonful of cold water that seems well-intentioned, which makes them suddenly doubt their beliefs and waver, often leading to discouragement. And the intention of pouring cold water is different from that of pouring enlightenment; the latter aims to input wisdom and make people comfortable, which is positive, while the former only aims to negatively destroy people's will, so it can also be said to be a soft knife that kills without bloodshed.</p>
<p>The Chinese people's will is worn down the fastest, young people easily become mature, and the fire of youth burns very briefly, because there is too much cold water in China. Not to mention anything else, just say that most of the ancient and modern literature contains the effect of pouring cold water. This kind of cold water literature has a formula, which is the "Song of Good and Bad" sung by the lame Taoist to Zhen Shiyin in *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Here is one of them:</p>
<p>"The world all knows immortals are good, only fame and fortune they can't forget. Where are the generals and ministers of ancient and modern times? Mounds of graves covered with grass are all that remains."</p>
<p>The simplest example that fits this formula is Li Bai's poem:</p>
<p>"King Goujian of Yue returned after defeating Wu, the warriors returned home in brocade clothes, palace maids like flowers filled the spring palace—now only partridges are seen flying."</p>
<p>This kind of work can be found endlessly in ancient and modern poetry collections, and they are all among the best. In recent times, someone compiled a "Heart-Stirring Melody Collection," which only collected a thin volume of works from ancient and modern times, but if you were to compile a cold water literature collection, it would be so large that it could "reach your height."</p>
<p>Ancient Chinese literature can be roughly divided into two schools: one is the court literature that carries the Confucian way, which is written by successful scholar-officials, talking about positive principles, but it is mostly stale and even unworthy of being called literature. The other school can be said to be pure literature, which mostly comes from the hands of the unsuccessful, influenced by Taoism or Buddhism, because both Taoism and Buddhism advocate transcending the present world, so this school of literature also takes the idea that everything in the present world is empty as its common center.</p>
<p>However, although both Taoism and Buddhism see through the present world, they either advocate returning to nature or advocate rebirth in the Pure Land. On the other hand, they still have their positive beliefs. The lame Taoist's "Song of Good and Bad" ultimately considers immortals to be good and "completion" as the destination, so it has not yet fallen into nihilism and is not entirely cold water literature. As for those who thoroughly deny even immortals and do not believe in the Pure Land, that is truly cold water literature, but there is a contradiction in it. Those who have no faith and cannot be completed are bitter, but this bitterness is not impossible to dispel. The way to dispel it is to curse the present world while still using everything in the present world to anesthetize one's soul, raise a glass to dispel sorrow, and end up confused: hence the saying that it is rare to be confused in life.</p>
<p>Some of today's humor literature is also cold water literature. It considers itself to be a transcendental school, observing the world with a cold eye and mocking everything, not only laughing at those who diligently pursue profit, but also laughing at those who diligently pursue righteousness, not only laughing at what others cry about, but also laughing at what others laugh about. No matter how big or small the matter is, no matter how wise or foolish the person is, they are all doused with cold water, thinking that they have succeeded. This is the attitude of many humorists today. Mr. Lin Yutang advocates humor with the gentle and honest poetry teaching as advice, but the most popular attitude among most of our humorists is, as Pett Ridge said, "It is better to mock the protagonist of a story than to laugh along with him." The difference cannot be measured in miles.</p>
<p>If you were to investigate what the positive beliefs of these humorists who mock everything are, they would probably be confused. The British humor magazine *Punch* once published a humorous story: "Two Englishmen in Paris once passed a store and saw the words 'English Spoken' written on the door. They went in to shop, but saw that the saleswoman did not speak a word of English. So one of them asked in incorrect French, 'Who speaks English?' The saleswoman replied, 'The English-speaking customers do.'"</p>
<p>This is a good example of the confused category in humorous literature.</p>
<h3>After Seeing the Fourth Exhibition of the West Lake Art Academy</h3>
<p>— Zhang Tianyi</p>
<p>After the Fourth Exhibition of the West Lake Art Academy, I really wanted to say a few words, although many people have already published some critical articles in the newspapers. I am not just joining in the fun. It's just that after visiting this art exhibition, I felt a sense of relief, and therefore I couldn't help but express my feelings.</p>
<p>I believe that at a time when so-called post-impressionist "art disciples are all over the world," the West Lake Art Academy's opening of this exhibition is a very interesting and meaningful thing.</p>
<p>Last year, we saw a solo exhibition belonging to a post-impressionist. We only saw him frantically applying some paint, and gained nothing else. This is not surprising, as this is the style of the school, as long as the paint is applied vigorously, the outline doesn't matter. But the paintings of the West Lake Art Academy are very powerful in their expression of lines. Lines are originally very troublesome, so this kind of painting art, which has reached its late stage, can only enjoy itself in the paint. The powerful lines symbolize the art that is rising. Although the styles of this art exhibition are different, they are consistent in this point.</p>
<p>The so-called enjoying oneself in the paint, if it is said that color represents emotion, and therefore piling up red and green masses is a strong emotion, this is an exaggeration. Neglecting lines and only brushing paint, this kind of painting method is easy to imitate. The Chinese followers of Cézanne only returned to this "sect" for the sake of convenient imitation: imitation is the entire life of their works. But the people at the West Lake Art Academy just don't imitate, whether it's Chinese painting or Western painting. As soon as you see it, it makes you feel relieved and able to breathe freely. But if you say that this one is influenced by someone, and that one is influenced by someone, that's possible. But it's just influence, and the things are still the author's own.</p>
<p>As for the content, this art exhibition should also arouse attention. From the previous groping for personal desires (such as "Groping") and personal desires (such as "Desire for Life"), it has now developed to a broader aspect—like Bin Hong's "Alley Elegy," which is not just personal grief. Facing this painting, with Bin Hong's powerful lines and the placement of warm and cold colors, everyone will have a strong and profound impression.</p>
<p>In this time when content is not needed, lines are neglected, and only tricks are played with profits, creating a chaotic atmosphere, the West Lake Art Academy used a new posture to open this exhibition, which is a very pleasant thing. Even from the perspective of the artist's attitude, the teachers and students of the West Lake Art Academy are different from those loud-mouthed philistine artists. They don't flatter, don't ask great figures to write inscriptions, and don't add any badges to themselves. They just silently work hard to learn and practice. They are very humble, and they have never been complacent. And they have achieved this result.</p>
<h3>Two Folk Love Songs from Anhui</h3>
<p>— Rui Zi</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Seventeen or eighteen, a flower on a branch, if I don't look for my love now, when will I? Bamboo shoots grow old joint by joint, frost hits the leaves and they gradually wither, gradually wither, without my love, I suffer loneliness night after night.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Big stars in the sky face small stars, an eighteen-year-old sister has been looking for her love until now; I don't know how many dark night roads I have walked, I don't know how much fear and shock I have suffered, standing, I'm afraid of being seen, squatting, I'm afraid of mosquito bites, walking to the front village, the dogs bark, walking to the back village, the tigers hum. I have to summon up my courage and look forward, calling my love's name and scolding at the same time.</p>
<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Xia Chang</p>
<p>(12)</p>
<p>The short writings of the ancients often contain excellent works. For example, Zhang Yi (Baiyun) said to the monk Chuyun: "Continuous rain for ten days, moss encroaching on the stove's edge, no smoke in the morning chimney. Sitting quietly for a few breaths, I happily recite: 'Placing this body in the midst of ten thousand green shades, being poor with nine meals in thirty days is not poverty, if I could abstain from grains and fly lightly, who would be the host and guest of famous mountains?' I present this to my teacher, asking for a turning word." This is truly a person who can be said to be poor but successful. Also, Xu Fang said to Chen Gongzou: "Continuous rain is already annoying, especially for a lonely guest in an empty mountain? If I don't take a trip to the stream temple, this year's spring scenery will be entrusted to the flowing water again. A small banquet at Chang'an is very good, and seeking elsewhere may not be better. So it is advisable to stay here for a short time and choose good things to follow, without being hasty." This is also very unrestrained and evocative, making people think of pastoral life. As for what Luo Shizhen (Yixian) said to Tan Shaocheng: "Sublime interest enters my heart, forgetting that the pots and kettles are all empty," this is all about the lack of poor people, and nature helps them, not only helping them to succeed, but also using nature as a painted cake to fill their hunger.</p>
<h3>Dusk (6)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Qingsong slowly stood up from her seat and walked to Qingzhi's side, gently taking the flute from her; at this time, Qingzhi stared at her in astonishment with tear-filled eyes, as if asking why she was doing this.</p>
<p>Qingsong already understood her question, she said:</p>
<p>"Sister, I'm just afraid you'll be sad. Playing the flute is originally a tiring thing, and if you cry again, wouldn't that be too bad for your health?"</p>
<p>As she spoke, Qingsong used her handkerchief to wipe the tears from Qingzhi's face, but when Qingsong also sat down, they suddenly hugged each other and cried.</p>
<p>Dusk seemed to be gradually falling, the azure autumn sky became deep purple, then deep gray, and flocks of crows flew past in the sky. This easily made people think of this ancient city, whose rise and fall were all in the sounds of crows calling. Or it was a premonition that this city, this city was about to sink deeply into the darkness of night. In this declining scene, the autumn wind was still rolling up pieces of falling leaves, hitting the window, and uttering complaints that were not understood. They had had good times, and knowing that they would perish with the times, they turned themselves red and beautiful with a little energy; but as the days of autumn triumphantly advanced, they fell from above, and they were to be trampled by the feet of people and beasts, and become dust on the roadside. But the vast twilight could envelop everything, with neither beauty nor ugliness, making people forget everything and only become blurred shadows.</p>
<p>In the twilight scene, looking at the outline of them embracing, it was as if old lovers who had long lost the fire of youth, only weakly, like enduring lifelong suffering until they had white hair, met, the long and distant sad days made them have endless grievances to pour out; but also only weakly, like two withered vines intertwined, their bodies shaking as they embraced.</p>
<p>They both felt their heads spinning, and Qingsong gently opened the window. They leaned on each other and looked out the window, watching aimlessly, as if gaining a sense of emptiness and vastness. In this silence, they deeply felt a little bit of comfort for their bodies and minds.</p>
<p>Dinner was brought up by the maid, and they had to turn on the lights, and for a moment their eyes felt a strong stinging pain. But they gradually didn't feel anything, but after dinner, waiting for the maid to take the dishes away, they turned off the lights again and sat by the window; the beautiful autumn moon, big and round, rose up again.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The New Life Movement</h3>
<p>— Shou Zi</p>
<p>Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek launched the New Life Movement in Nanchang, the general idea of which is to take propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as the center of life, and to be diligent, hard-working, honest, and disciplined, so that one can become a new citizen. This is a very meaningful thing.</p>
<p>At present, the lives of the Chinese people are indeed too "un-new." Greed, filth, shamelessness, and lowness, all the evils of mankind, have almost become the only popular atmosphere in our society now. If you don't eat, that's it, but if you want to eat, you must be greedy, filthy, shameless, and low. The more you eat, the more greedy, filthy, shameless, and low you become. This is truly a very heartbreaking phenomenon. Now that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is advocating the New Life Movement, with propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as the center, it can be said to be prescribing the right medicine for the disease, which can somewhat reverse these trends.</p>
<p>However, I still have a point of view. The ancients said it well, "When clothing and food are sufficient, people know propriety and righteousness." It can be seen that if you want the people to "know propriety and righteousness," you must first make them able to have "sufficient clothing and food." "Sufficient clothing and food" is the only prerequisite for "knowing propriety and righteousness." It also says: "Teach after wealth." That is, to "teach" the people, you must first "enrich" the people. The meaning is the same as the previous sentence. Then, can most of our people now have "sufficient clothing and food"? Are they "rich"? Of course not. What we see is the bankruptcy of tens of millions of farmers, and the reduction of work or closure of batches of factories. What the people need most now seems to be only the two words "clothing and food." Under these circumstances, whether it is possible to promote propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame seems to be somewhat problematic. I am not saying that it is impossible to promote propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame under the current circumstances, but rather that before promoting propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, one should pay a little attention to the people's livelihood problems. Because this is an important prerequisite for promoting propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Therefore, I hope that after launching the meaningful New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will come up with an even more meaningful policy that will enable the general public to have "sufficient clothing and food" and to be "rich." If this is the case, then Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's contributions to the people will be unattainable. This is one.</p>
<p>Secondly, in addition to the fact that the lives of the general public are too "un-new," the general social phenomena in our country are also too un-new. Red pills, white flour, opium, extortionate taxes, miscellaneous taxes, corrupt officials, dirty officials, local tyrants, evil gentry, floods, droughts, wars, and the infighting of military personnel in various places (such as the Guizhou War, the conflict between Sun and Ma, and the Sichuan War that just stopped not long ago), have made the people no longer have new hope, and society no longer has a bright place. These are the reasons that make our society uniquely "un-new." If we really want to make our people new and live a new life, I think the above-mentioned sources of poison must be completely removed first. If these sources of poison are not removed, I am afraid that the people will not be able to become new. Society is a mass of darkness, and the people are living in abject poverty. Where can new light arise from? Therefore, I hope that after advocating the New Life Movement, the wise Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will come up with an even more meaningful task of how to thoroughly realize the New Life. I think Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has probably already taken this into account. This is two.</p>
<p>The above is my opinion. Finally, I hope that all Chinese people will support this New Life Movement. And even more support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in how to further make this New Life thoroughly realized, that is, how to make the people have "sufficient clothing and food," how to make the people "rich," and how to thoroughly eliminate the unique sources of poison that prevent this society from becoming "new." This is an important task. And only in this way can the New Life Movement become more meaningful.</p>
<h3>Little Life</h3>
<p>— Shu Xian</p>
<p>Only a week after giving birth, she bravely struggled to go back to work in the factory. On the one hand, the factory had already used up her limited leave. On the other hand, she was willing to earn a little more wage herself, so she could do something more for her only little life.</p>
<p>Before dawn, without waiting for the factory's sharp whistle to urge her, she automatically got out of bed, hastily ate two bowls of cold rice, and hurriedly picked up the sleeping infant from the warm quilt. She lovingly and sweetly kissed his round little face, tightly wrapped him with a dozen pieces of rags, and carried him out of the door, bathing in the faint light of the sparse morning stars, walking towards the factory on the quiet, long road.</p>
<p>She is now a mother with a son! Her infinite happiness and hope for the future are all on this son. She must work harder to raise him well, cherish him, and for him, she would rather endure all the suffering that others cannot endure! She thought this way as she walked.</p>
<p>In the dim light of dawn, one can vaguely see the towering factory chimney and the terrifying black smoke that pours from the window and streams diagonally across the sky. Before she was swallowed by the factory's iron gate, which looked like a gaping blood mouth, she tightly covered the infant's head with two pieces of rags, then pretended to be calm and walked slowly past the gatekeeper with shining eyes, indicating that the package did not contain a secretly smuggled infant, but some other object.</p>
<p>Having sneaked through the factory gate, she breathed a sigh of relief and walked straight into the workshop. Many sisters curiously gathered around, all vying to take a look. Praises, congratulations, and envious sighs</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>, a cacophony of voices.</p>
<p>It was time for the shift change! The sisters gradually dispersed to busy themselves with their own work. She opened a cover plate under the machine and stuffed the little life into the gap in the machine's belly.</p>
<p>This is the most proper method for female workers in the factory to secretly feed their children. The machine's belly is also the only secret cradle for those female workers' children. The machine's wheels quickly rotate next to the child's body, and dark purple machine oil drips onto the child's body and head, but this will not cause any unexpected danger, as long as the mother's binding skills are skillful, the child will lie inside motionless as if listening. In the noisy machine shop, the child's crying cannot be heard at all, and the tender child will naturally fall asleep from the strong vibration of the machine. Therefore, as long as the breastfeeding is done discreetly, it is very difficult for factory staff to detect it.</p>
<p>Nine o'clock arrived! It was the time for the staff to change shifts and rest. So she first asked many sisters to serve as sentries in all directions, then gathered many sisters to tightly surround her, quickly opened the machine cover plate, and carefully took the little treasure out of the machine's belly to breastfeed. As soon as the nipple was put into the infant's small mouth, she suddenly heard an emergency signal from the sentry. Everyone knew that the staff was coming, and hurriedly hid the infant again, and everyone dispersed.</p>
<p>After work, when she dragged the infant out of the machine's belly, she found that the infant had a strange abnormality. The eyes were so dull, the small breaths were so rapid that she was afraid, and the rosy little face had also turned ashen pale. Only then did she remember that someone had warned her when she entered the factory that a seven-day-old infant should not be brought into the factory. So she trembled! She saw boundless darkness coming upon her.</p>
<p>When she passed through the first card door, she stuffed a silver dollar into the hand of the woman who searched her. The woman smiled cunningly and nodded slightly to her. She was then let go.</p>
<p>After leaving the factory gate, she ran home in one breath. When she looked at the infant more carefully, the infant's breathing had already stopped! But she did not cry, she only shouted "Heaven", and her body collapsed onto the little corpse.</p>
<h3>The Story of a Street Urchin (9)</h3>
<p>— Produced by Chen Jingsheng</p>
<p>Good fellow, such powerful little tricks</p>
<h3>The Metaphor of Life</h3>
<p>— Jianshe</p>
<p>Watching those countrymen who, once holding a policeman's baton, spare no effort in beating the Jiangbei elders, astonishment is always unavoidable. Originally, one would think that the countryman is also Chinese, and the Jiangbei elder is also Chinese. With only a slight difference in region, there is such a bad feeling, which is indeed worthy of astonishment. Because the general countrymen's notion is that countrymen are like-minded.</p>
<p>However, I still want to say that those who hold this view do not understand the philosophy of maggots at all.</p>
<p>If we pass through the countryside and pay attention to the rural manure tanks, we can definitely find small white worms that are twice as long as rice on the edge of the tank, and these are maggots. If we pay even more attention, we can definitely discover that these small white maggots are not stationary on the edge of the tank, but are constantly, tirelessly, vigorously climbing towards the very top of the tank edge.</p>
<p>There is no need to doubt that their upward climbing has a pure and profound meaning. Because once they climb out of the tank edge, they can undergo a metamorphosis, that is, live in the black pupal shell for a few days, and then transform into a buzzing fly that can fly. And there is no need to doubt that this is social advancement!</p>
<p>Originally, being a maggot is not very remarkable; and there are so many maggots. And all they eat is the manure pile, manure. To be able to step over the heads of other maggots, treat other fellow creatures as stepping stones for their own upward climb, and climb all the way to the edge of the tank, undergoing metamorphosis, so that the body is fat, and they can fly, and they can approach the most lovable and sweetest things in the world as they please, which maggot wouldn't want that?</p>
<p>From our point of view, a fly is not necessarily more remarkable than a maggot. However, some maggots clearly do not think this way. And this is the difference between maggots and us, and it is also what is called the philosophy of maggots.</p>
<p>To understand the philosophy of maggots is of course to understand the meaning of maggots wanting to climb onto the edge of the tank, but thinking that a maggot is so rare to climb onto the manure tank, they may also feel the blandness of this life!</p>
<h3>Also Discussing the Rent Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Recently, white banners with blue characters have often been found on the streets, written in a very neat official script, and the wording is also very fresh, the most prominent being "To prosper Shanghai, you must first reduce rents." This slogan is naturally very legal, otherwise it would inevitably be like the black characters on the utility poles, covered with a layer of lime. Vaguely, like an eighteen-year-old young lady wearing a pink silk gauze dress. But the former does not enchant people, but instead arouses a sense of righteous indignation. Because of this righteous banner, people cannot help but think of the "January 28th" incident, when stores posted "Brutal troops invade, strike to resist insults" at their doors, and later, the "long-term resistance, open for business with pain." Although the antithetical couplets are not as well-balanced as similar spring couplets such as "Favorable weather for crops, the nation is prosperous and the people are at peace," their style is quite similar to spring couplets, assuming that the sound of the cannons is the sound of firecrackers.</p>
<p>Let's get back to the topic, then, the rent reduction slogan is not just a perfunctory official document. And it also gives people a sense of justice. However, soon after, I read a great article from a group of heroes and good men, saying that to prosper Shanghai, you must first "pacify the interior." There is probably an unparalleled reason, but unfortunately, I cannot understand it and do not remember it. However! In this way, the so-called prosperity becomes quite problematic. So I also thought about this issue.</p>
<p>From the perspective of general patriots, perhaps they think very thoroughly. For example, the current market is depressed, and "massive discounts" and "15% off" banners adorn the New Year of singing and dancing; if rents are reduced by two yuan, it will increase purchasing power by two yuan, so domestic goods can be revitalized, and the market will become more prosperous day by day, and store owners will smile happily; isn't it like giving a dying patient a shot of morphine? But attempting to prosper Shanghai with the blood of "bandits" ultimately feels like the bloody smell is too strong, only cannibals would be so ferocious. It's really scary to talk about.</p>
<p>People who live in Shanghai probably know very well that Shanghai's rents are indeed shockingly expensive. It goes without saying that a three-story building costs eighty-five taels a month or a large厢房 costs fifty yuan, but a small pavilion room that can only fit an iron bed and a typewriter in the Beijing Road area costs ten yuan, in Caojiadu it also costs seven yuan, and one with pasted floral paper costs fourteen yuan or more.</p>
<p>I once had a friend who was learning to paint, and he rented a small pavilion room for ten yuan a month. Because he was learning to paint, he used charcoal to draw nude women on the white wall. I asked him, "Why are you doing this?" He replied angrily, "I have lived here for one year, a total of one hundred and twenty yuan, which is enough to build this small house, which means I bought it, why can't I paint?" This statement is very reasonable, and the extent of his anger can be imagined.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a husband and wife both work, they can earn fifteen yuan a month in total, averaging five 角大洋 per day, and the rent takes away two 角三分强, what is enough for the remaining two 角六分? Each person eating two bowls of Yangchun noodles a day also costs 大洋 two 角, plus three seven two hundred and ten 文, even including drinking ball brand water... Calculated in this way, the rent takes away half of the income. Spending twelve hours a day in the factory inhaling cotton dust is equivalent to working six hours for the landlord. This is of course happy for the bloated vampires, and half of the workers' flesh and blood fly out of the chimney for the real estate developers. If the industry is already like this, then the unemployed are crying even more bitterly. No work, no food, but the rent must always be paid, otherwise they will be locked up in the Public Security Bureau to uphold the national law.</p>
<p>Therefore, the rent reduction movement is more of a rescue for the workers than a prosperity for Shanghai!</p>
<h3>The Humor of the National Socialist Party</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>The task of the National Socialist Party, as explained by Rosenberg, the director of foreign affairs of the National Socialist Party, is stated precisely as follows -</p>
<p>"What the National Socialist Party proclaims to the people, and what it requires of the people, does not require that 60 million German people all agree with it; the main point is that the German people must all take the same attitude! Approximately, one of the ideas that General Hitler has believed in for the longest time will surely be realized one day - what is the idea? That is, the movement of the National Socialist Party will one day become crystallized, and can be represented by an order - this order represents absolute authority, and the party's command is executed by this order!"</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd, Havas telegram.</p>
<p>This speech is truly the pinnacle of euphemism and circumlocution. Before the next sentence is spoken, the explanation of the next sentence is spoken first. It can be said that the party is extremely careful and capable!</p>
<p>In a word!! "Hitler's orders must be uniformly obeyed and followed by all German people."!! So what is the task of the National Socialist Party? Hitler issues orders for the benefit of a minority! This is the task of all tasks.</p>
<p>We cannot believe in Hitler-style orders.</p>
<p>We can find a political formula for the National Socialist Party here!!</p>
<p>"The party's command" is "absolute authority". "Absolute authority" is "order". "Order" is "the idea that Hitler has believed in for the longest time"!! That is, the idea of ​​the steel magnate behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The above is an abstract formula, let us establish a concrete formula!!</p>
<p>This is the most central political policy of the National Socialist Party.</p>
<h3>It's Hard to Be an Official</h3>
<p>— Guang Nan</p>
<p>After thinking it over, it's still more advantageous for a person to be an official. Promotion and wealth have always been the two major goals of Chinese people, but in fact, these two are related. With promotion, one can naturally become wealthy, and with wealth, there will definitely be official promotion, which is precisely two in one. Therefore, I only choose one. However, being an official is sometimes not easy. For example, recently Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued an order to strictly prohibit banquets, smoking, and gambling, and the two chairmen of Henan and Shandong are also promoting vigor, which is truly a great misfortune for the officialdom. Just imagine, being an official but not being able to indulge in wine and food, and having to get up at dawn, what kind of official is that? Is this kind of official good to be?</p>
<p>When a person becomes an official, 洋房, cars, and women should all be available. It is unreasonable not to think about enjoyment. Moreover, when a person becomes an official, relatives and friends will naturally increase, so socializing and entertaining is inevitable, how can one avoid banquets, smoking, and gambling? But Chairman Chiang Kai-shek does not think so, saying something like "Worry can lead to survival, while joy invites calamity," encouraging people to "be vigilant and diligent, and to reflect on themselves," not allowing "indulging in wine and food, nor considering laziness as a good plan," even smoking and gambling are strictly prohibited, believing that these two "consume ambition and waste time, truly great misfortunes that ruin the country and the family," doesn't this disappoint people greatly?</p>
<p>Now that the ways for officials to enjoy themselves have been banned, then every official sits in the office from morning till night, busy all day (?), sleeping in a few hours in the morning is not considered laziness, or even being able to rush to the office during the prescribed office hours can be said to be fulfilling one's duty. How could they know that the two chairmen of Henan and Shandong even want to deprive them of this little bit of leisure, calling on people to "rise at the sound of the rooster," saying that this is to "promote vigor and strengthen the body," isn't it extremely unlucky?</p>
<p>In recent China, everything has really changed, even being an official is a bit difficult!</p>
<h3>To My Friend</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Received your letter from the edge of West Lake, so passionate, so indignant, so sad, and so gently expressing a cry of sorrow for life!</p>
<p>Since things are difficult to your liking, it is good to go back for a while, but going back will make you even sadder. My meaning is that you should endure the current pain, do not be too emotional, this era will never give us a day of comfort, as long as there is a central point to support life, you can hold on to it and not let go. For the regret that your past efforts have not yielded results, although it is human nature, it is also unnecessary. Friend, I want to warn you: if the heart of regret is too strong, the feeling of disappointment will be deep, and if the fire of being a person is completely extinguished, then the ending will naturally only be a path of suicide and self-abandonment.</p>
<p>Your and Shushan's life experiences are quite similar, and your personalities are somewhat alike in many ways. Shushan committed suicide, and to this day we still deeply hide an irreparable wound. When a group of us gather together to remember Shushan's death, we still can't hold back the tears of crying together at home! You should think deeply about this sad scene, and the thought of suicide and self-abandonment may re-stir up waves in your brain.</p>
<p>I often say: a pessimistic person has strength, a courageous, thorough, and positive attitude towards life. People who give up on themselves, or even commit suicide, are too optimistic about the world. Optimism easily leads to disappointment, easily leads to negativity, easily leads people to fall into a circle of sadness, unable to extricate themselves.</p>
<p>We should be people of society, people of the nation, people of the world. Many things are crippled in the personal aspect, but looking at the whole, they emit brilliance. People with rich emotions cannot but treat this kind of empty talk as their own ideal and live by it. Do you have such an ideal? You are now in a real life, you must not question the foundation of life because of current disappointments!</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox</p>
<h3>Face Turns Green</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>In the amateur mailbox column of the supplement of this newspaper, I often see many difficult questions, all of which are answered in detail by you. This really makes me admire and respect you. Now I have a difficult matter, please do not abandon me and give me a concrete answer!</p>
<p>The matter is as follows:</p>
<p>My father is a clerk in a factory in his sixties. In the past (three years ago), he opened a small company. This was jointly established with the capital of nine shareholders. My father had the most shares, so he was appointed manager by the shareholders. Unfortunately, after doing it for two or three years, due to poor sales and low prices, it was closed down at a loss. In addition to losing all of his own shares, my father was also responsible for repaying the shareholders' shares at that time.</p>
<p>After a year, my father, due to the heavy pressure of share debts and the compulsion of life, entrusted a relative to introduce him, and dragged his aging body into the factory to work. In less than a year, I was also introduced by a relative to work in the same factory as my father, as a trainee. At that time, I was exactly seventeen years old.</p>
<p>Because the salary is too small to pay for the expenses at home, it is even impossible to repay the shareholders' debts. We can often receive letters from shareholders urging us to pay.</p>
<p>Recently, I received a letter containing... "I hope to pay off the debts within these few days, otherwise, I will come to your house to sit, eat, and live, and report to the officialdom for investigation," and so on. My father was stunned and his face turned green after reading it at that time. Therefore, as his son, seeing my father so anxious, I had to ask for your advice.</p>
<p>Sir: Is there any legal basis for this? I am waiting for your reply. Respectfully wish</p>
<p>Zhuo An Hua Yafu respectfully</p>
<p>Editor's note: When the partnership property is insufficient to pay off debts, each partner should bear joint and several liability in accordance with Article 681 of the Civil Code. If Mr. Hua's father can provide evidence of the partnership, and that the store's loss was not caused by his deliberate or negligent acts, then he is not liable for compensation for the shares, and the partners cannot "come to your house to sit, eat, and live."</p>
<p>By mail: To Ms. Lan Fen: The purpose of the job introduction in this publication is to facilitate the general unemployed. If you want to publish it, please send a letter to the amateur weekly of this newspaper.</p>

<h3>Lulu's Victory (10) (2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jingxin, written by Italian M. Saice Ao</p>
<p>One evening Lulu walked into her room. "Would you help me with something?" she asked.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I have some notes to take," Lulu said. "Robert is alone on the balcony outside. Would you be willing to keep him company?"</p>
<p>"But I!!"</p>
<p>"Would you rather be locked up in here alone? Is it so difficult to do something for me?"</p>
<p>"Will you be here soon?"</p>
<p>"I just need to write four lines."</p>
<p>Sophia turned to the balcony, mustering her courage for this punishment. She stopped at the door. Robert was walking back and forth; she walked towards him.</p>
<p>"Lulu told me to come," she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>"You came reluctantly, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"Reluctantly!!"</p>
<p>Every fiber of her body was trembling; Robert was approaching her, his face deformed by desire.</p>
<p>"What have I done to make you dislike me, Sophia?"</p>
<p>"Nothing at all. Please don't look at me like that," she pleaded, frightened.</p>
<p>"Then, Sophia, you know that I love you very much."</p>
<p>"Ah! Don't say that, Robert, for God's sake, don't say that! What if Lulu hears!"</p>
<p>"I don't love Lulu. I love you, Sophia."</p>
<p>"You are deceiving."</p>
<p>"I know, but I love you. I want to leave!!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Lulu cried out in the distance, appearing at another door. "Oh, are you two quiet?"</p>
<p>But no one answered. Sophia fled, her face hidden in her hands; Robert stood there motionless, silent, as if he had fainted.</p>
<p>"Robert!" Lulu called out.</p>
<p>"Lulu."</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you?"</p>
<p>"Nothing; I want to go."</p>
<p>Without even saying goodbye to her, he thought about the appearance of despair, Lulu's eyes followed him.</p>
<p>Standing there, lost in thought.</p>
