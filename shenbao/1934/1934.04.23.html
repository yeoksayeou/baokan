<h3>國際對日與我國方針</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>最近日本外務省所發表之非正式聲明。荒謬絶倫。業經國際際與論。痛加枰　。廣田外相。鑒於外間空氣激昂。乃卽迅速轉圓。謂日本無意違反開放門户與機會均等政策。對於現行條約。亦無侵犯之意云云。寳司馬昭之心。路人皆知。空言搪塞。欲蓋彌彰。日人縱稱慧點。又安得以一手而掩盡天下人之耳目哉。</p>
<p>今日國際形勢之危殆說者比諸一九一四年大戰　發之前夕。殊非過言。如裁軍會議之環瀕絶境。法德意三國之互爭雄長。兩大盎格魯撤遜民族之同牀異夢。法西斯黨與共產黨之劍㧞弩張。多瑙河之漩渦。巴爾幹之陰翳。凡此種種。幾於家喻户曉。不待　述。此次日本所以敢師其提出二十一條故智。危言恫嚇。欲一舉而夷我國於其保護國之地位。未始非國際形勢。有以致之。然此固非謂國際方面。將一任日本之横行。而不敢作最後裁制之决心也。若英若美若俄。固與遠東有密切之關係者也。九一八事變旣作。日兵席捲我</p>
<p>東北四省。各該國家。雖未出以積極裁制之行動。而其所以亟亟從事於軍備之整頓。實因感覺日本威脅而然。則無可否認。據各國初意。日本撰得滿洲後。當知適可而止。故亦暫取監視態度。不爲已甚。自最近日本聲明發表後。國際情勢乃突然一變。觀於各國主要報紙之言論。其奮發激昂。實較九一八事變初起時。有過之而無不及。英美民主國家。向以民意之嚮背。而定政策之採拒。而報紙言論。又爲其民意嚮背之測量器。美之紐約時報。英之倫敦太晤士報曼却斯德指導報等。素爲其多數國民所愛讀。而兼以保守穩健著稱。今對日本立塲皆不惜嚴詞駁斥由是而鼓動之與論力。當必爲其政府所重視。若英之薛西爾子爵。工黨幹部人員。若美之參議員波拉。金氏等。皆已有嚴正之表示矣。英美政府。終將守其靜默態度。無形中　成日人跋　囂張之氣耶。以吾人之觀察。恐不至此。姑拭目以俟其後可也。俄自去年十月間發表日本之」　文書「後。對日作戰之凖備。益趨露骨。昨其主席加里　氏。復發表警告。主張積極備戰。婦孺皆兵。亦未始非對日本最近聲明而發。再言國聯過去之態度。雖似軟弱。實則因其重要會員國間之立塲。未能一致。故不得。不爾。今日本旣向國聯直接挑囂。而　聯主要會員。國若英法意等。亦皆開始感覺往者縱容日本之非計。今後之國聯。當不致再蹈旣往之覆轍。矧蘇聯爲鞏固其對日陣線計。業有加入國聯之表示。更可彼此倚賴。增益聲勢。由此觀之。日本若必欲以武力贯澈其封鎖中國之計劃。恐非易易。吾人雖不能謂日人恫嚇。盡出空言。然深覺以一國之小。樹敵於天下。彼邦軍閥。縱甚　預。亦必不至此。然則此次日本之眞意。果何在乎。</p>
<p>吾人以爲日本發表非正式聲明。决非偶然之事。反之。實爲其一貫政策之</p>
<p>表現。所謂一貫政策者。卽欲造成其東亞門羅主義。最後使中國海丨甚至太平洋丨化爲日本之湖沼而已。一政治主義之造成。非旦夕之功。可以驟幾。必也先以自行標榜之主張。時時聒絮於世人耳鼓之前。旁敲側撃。積銖累寸。一待水到渠成。斯其宿願償矣。考美國門羅主義之完成。其初亦不遇爲片面之主張。及後屢加解釋。屢加補充使無形中成爲國際默認之原則。日本欲提倡東亞門羅主義。非止朝夕。意亦猶此。如旣往二十一條之要求藍辛石井恊定之訂結反對銀行團向華投資。反對國聯對華技。術合作。皆爲其具體之表現。今其滿洲地位。旣臻鞏固。而蘇聯態度。大堪憂慮。自願乘國際多事之秋。重行申述其一貫之立塲。吾人今欲反對一政治主義。自當持之以恒。體察入微。不然。將適爲其作短期義務之宣傳。使人人心目中存有此種主義之印象而巳。若然。則日人方將竊喜之不暇。更何肯就此而罷手。</p>
<p>今後吾人可以遵循之方針凡四第一。當堅持旣往不亢不卑之政策。中日外交。無論鉅細。悉由中樞當局肩起全責。而與對方之中樞當局相周旋。第二。立卽進行外交總動員。由全體駐外使領人員。向其駐在國朝野。反復申說日方聲明之意義。以喚起并擴大名該國之與論力。第三。格外鞏固内部團結。調整對外步驟。第四積極從事於建設事業。本旣定計劃。邁步前進。勿爲威脅而自餒。</p>
<p>吾人雅不欲以國際形勢之略有好轉而沾沾自喜。然經此周折。打破外交沉悶局面。而使醉心於對日妥恊論者得一嶓然覺悟之機會。則亦未始非福耳。</p>

<h3>本報特派記者賡雅　改進中之綏省敎育</h3>
<p>綏遠敎育情况、擴敎廳閻廳長致遠談、全省計省立中等敎育七校、内有中學·男師·女師·各二校、及職業學校一所、二中在包頭、二師在集寗、餘與小學五校、均在省垣、小學部近巳成立童子軍、惟因學生家境困難、校費支絀、組織推進、稍感困難、高中學生、實行軍訓、業已領發槍櫙、從事操演、五月間擬舉行獎學金考試、各校學生、成續七十分以上者、皆可與考、全省敎育行政會議、亦將繼續舉行、最近并巳擬定整理各級敎育方案、務期按步實施如下、</p>
<p>中等敎育、（甲）師範學校、經費已佔中等敎費百分之六十、超出部定應佔百分之二十五以上、以後不求量的增加、先求質的改良、辦法、㈠確定學制、卽自二十三年度起、定省立一師·爲完全師範、師範。附中·各辦三班、第二師範、定爲四年制簡易師範、完成四班規模、女師亦然、中山學院（五族學院改辦）師範班·畢業後不再續招、改辦職校、至二十五年度、完足班次、爲必成量、㈡充實設備、卽籌措經費、令各校儘先購買圖書·儀器·標本等物、以期增加敎學上之效率、㈢增加鄕如用省欵、超出比例數更多時、則令各縣聯合興辦、以設立三處爲必成量、</p>
<p>（乙）中學校、綏省設立中學·爲時最久、學生程度、初中較内地各省、尙無大差、惟校數太少、高中則太淺、其改進辦法、㈠擴充初中、現有初中三處、每年畢業三班、不敷高中及師範職業等校招生之用、擬自二十三年度、於省立一師内、附設初中一所、限滿三班、二十五年度、女師及二師、均各設附中、亦以三班爲限、至二十七年度、每年可畢業初中六班、是爲必成量、㈡必進高中、暫不增加班次、先求充實内容、庶免赴平津升學者不及格之慮、至如學風囂張、時起風潮、動輙停課、亦爲應行整飭改進之一端也、</p>
<p>（丙）職業學校、舊有初級職業一校、内有農科四班、擬卽逐漸擴充、廣儲生產人才、以爲經濟建設之用、其辦法、㈠整理舊有職校、卽自二十三年度起、添設畜牧科、并在省垣近村、置設農牧工塲、建築校舍、校址移入、以便學生實習、敎學上所用儀器·標本·圖書等物、逐年添補之㈡添設工科職校、因綏省爲出產毛革之區、每年以原料輸出外國、復將製成呢絨皮貨、來省銷售、實非經濟之道、擬自二十三年度、於中山學院内、籌辦工科職校、内設高級毛織科二班、初級製革科二班、以養成生產人才爲必成事項、并抽出敎育基金一部、開辦毛織製革工廠、以本省人才、製本省原料、而將製成品輸運於外、以建造本省經濟基礎、㈢設立各種職業補習班、上述職校、以農工兩科爲主體、他如家畜·烹飪·洗濯·縫紉·修理鐘表·安置電話·助產·測量·造胰·等簡易職業班、視各地需要、遞次舉辦、中以造胰·助產·安置電話等班、提先開辦、</p>
<p>高等敎育、綏省高中畢業生、爲數甚少、設立專科以上學校、暫時尙無必要、爲培養專門人才計、先規定留學津貼額、以獎勵學生升學及出洋、辦法㈠留學指定國内各大學生、至二十五年度以前、暫定津貼爲一百元、以培養農工理醫四科爲目標、定額共五十六名、次敎育十二名、文科十名、餘科共二十二名、以年級較高、儘先補領、同年級者、以成績較優者儘先遞補、㈡爲國外留學、暫定爲西洋五名、每名每年給津貼二千四百元、亦以造就農工理醫四科優越人才爲目的、㈢籌設專科學校、在需要上、似可暫作緩圖、小學敎育、甲改進小學校、綏省公私立小學校、大半設備不完、課本複雜、經費漫無標凖、擬自二十三年度起、規定整理辦法、㈠劃一經費標凖、卽令各縣敎育局、對於所屬小學經費、以劃一平均爲原則、敎員待遇、應以當地普通一人生活費之二倍至四倍、爲敎員最高最低薪俸標凖、㈡統一課程、廳設編審委員會、專事審查小學所用課本、合於部定標凖者、方准應用、否則禁止、以期增加敎育效率、㈢檢定敎師、㈣甄别私立小學、綏省私立小學、多由敎堂設立、名爲小學、實則以傳敎　爲宗旨、兒童畢業、知有宗敎、對於國家觀念、民族思相、概非所知、亟宜詳加考查、如謬程不合部定、實係傳敎者、卽嚴行取締、以重國民敎育、</p>
<p>此外創設糼稚園、自二十三年度、先在省會創設二處、漸次推及各縣、其師資暫由外聘、擴充社會敎育、則實施成年補習敎育、籌辦民衆補習學校、充實推廣民衆敎育館及圖書館、務期於十年之内、使全省十九歲以上、五十歲以下之失學民衆、用最經濟之金錢與時間、均得受一種補習敎育、最低限度、亦須達到能閱讀通俗書報之目的云、</p>

<h3>我國棉布事業之危機與救濟</h3>
<p>— 章榮初</p>
<p>㈢農村經濟破產與購買力薄弱農民爲棉布消費之主力軍、因帝國主義之經濟侵略、便農村經濟、瀕於破產、又因現金之不斷流出、使農產物之價格暴跌、在此種環境下、農民之購買力、益形薄弱、是以我國棉布工業之生產量、苟以人口計算、則不敷殊甚、而現在之存貨囤積、實迫於人民購買力之薄弱、</p>
<p>㈣國人崇拜洋貨之鄙陋心理我國社會經濟、雖極度恐慌、而國人崇拜洋貨之鄙陋心理、尤爲普遍趨勢、此種心理之造成、固由於物質文明之誘惑、而國人奢侈之習尙、亦爲重要原因、自小資產階級以上、相率購用洋貨、而下層農民、則無力購用棉布、則棉布事業、又安得不日形危亟哉、</p>
<p>基於上項情由、我國棉布工業之衰落、自有其已然之事實、吾人若不在根本上謀解决辦法、則國營棉布事業、必以不堪壓迫、而瀕於顚覆、此後救濟方略、鄙見所及如下、</p>
<p>㈠减輕紗花稅率棉布之製造原料、爲棉紗及棉花棉紗、自徵統稅、及改用全單位以來、每包以紗之粗細、須付稅六兩二錢五分、或八兩三錢外、尙須負担原料入口稅、十兩八錢、（蓋我國花質較遜、勢不能不用外棉）此項鉅額稅率、爲各國所未有、或以日本境内之紗花爲比較、則其同以外棉爲原料、而行銷國内不出口者、每包較我國廠家之負担、省去關稅及進口稅、凡十七八兩、而成紗之出口、亦較我國少負担外棉進口稅每包十兩七八錢、若在國内採辦棉花、則交通阻滯、及當地之需要、在在使商家裏足而不敢前者、是以欲圖棉布事業之振興、减輕紗花稅率一實必經之段階也</p>
<p>㈡施行工業獎勵政策近來外商紡織工廠、利用我國廉價勞力及原料、一避免關稅障碍、在華設廠、以與我國棉布廠商競爭、在馬關條約未廢、關稅恊定有效之時、我國以受不平等條約之束縳、實無法拒絶、而華商工廠之資本技術、决難與之抗衡、政府爲培養實業、安定民生起見、必須施行工業獎勵政策、華商工廠以經濟上之獎勵、使外商無所藉口、華商得以生存、否則各地棉布工廠、以不堪壓迫、陷於完全淘汰、而任外商獨佔市塲也、</p>
<p>㈢振導國人樂用國貨我國人口、在四萬萬以上、人人果能抱樂用國貨之决心、則實業之繁榮、固可立待、吾人欲圖棉布事業之挽救、必須全國上下、造成樂用國產棉布之習尙、政府更予有力之保護、則不難於絶境中求生存也、</p>
<p>我國棉布事業之危機、與急要之救濟、旣約如前述、政府諸公、應憬於實業顚危之迫切、從速安定社會秩序、健全政治組織、予以採納上列主張、而金融界亦應予以扶植、减輕利息之負担、充實資本之運用、使企業家得進而謀設備之週全、技術上之進步、生產之改良、嚴禁同業之不法競爭、以對外爲鵠的、謀業務之繁榮、則棉布事業之復興、庶有望焉、</p>
<h3>讀書問答　讀「啼笑因緣」（二續）</h3>
<p>「啼笑因緣」中所表現在思想、無疑地是充分帶有近代資產階級的基調的。在全書内’不僅構成本書骨幹的樊家樹的戀愛問題’卽那些」卑躬下士「的平民思想’以及」鋤强扶弱「的俠義行爲’也均是從資產階級的觀點出發。中國資產階級的特質’是一開始便踏上崩潰的危機’一開始便表現出極度的予盾、一開始便暴露了牠自身的軟弱：它不但無力建立和豐富牠自身的生活’而且時時有與敵人妥恊甚至投降的傾向。這特質’反映在社會的實際問題上’就成爲前面說過的」科學救國「與」唸經救國「在同一時間呌出的怪響’而反映在」啼笑因緣「内’便造成使」啼笑因緣「穿上」神怪「外衣的原因。倘我們因爲在」啼笑因緣「中看到了」山寺鋤奸「那樣的奇蹟’看到了」十三妹「那類的奇俠’而機械地認作與」七俠五義「」江湖奇俠傳「相等的’完全是封建社會的產物’那就大錯而特錯。啼笑因緣之所以穿上那件」神怪「的外衣’原不過是顯現出資產階級掩不住的」土老兒「相’資產階級在其本身的予盾中’在其崩潰的途徑上’無可奈何地退向封建的古墓中’去找　出路而巳。同時’在這裏我們還應該提到的’是本書作者張恨水先生。從本書内’我們看出他所受的文學敎養’是封建社會的’而不是近代資產階級的’所以他雖然想做一個資產階級的代言人、而終於只能描出一點浮淺的輪廓’只能用那」偶然「的」神怪「的舊針綫來織補出這一件」八卦衣「。資產階級旣沒有力量豐富自己的社會生活’也就不能完成它的文學的任務。如上情形’自然並不能怪張恨水先生’而是一般資產階級文人共有的厄運’張恨水先生雖是天才’能憑空想像出」啼笑因緣「’（據作者自序是這樣說）但却無力補救他的階級本身的缺陷。這一點’作爲回答那些以」啼笑因緣「描寫技巧上如何好·結構上如何好的人’是不爲無益的　　啼笑因緣所表現的思想’首先要提出的是降格迂尊的平民思想。在本書中’樊家樹之如何結交關壽峯’戀愛沈鳳喜’便是這種思想的具體表現。不過’這種思想的產生’一方面由於資產階級厭倦自身的生活’另一方面是由於他們看到自己的危機而思以恩惠來和緩被壓迫者的情緒’因此’通過樊家樹以表現出來的平民思相’也就不能溢出那居高臨下的好奇和憐憫的動機之外’而决不能從實生活的關係上’認識出平民是社會生活之直接支持者。這種現象在現社會上’是非常之多的。放高利貸的豪紳地主’並不失其做大慈善家的資格。在本書中’」魔窟逃生「一塲使樊端本也要和關壽峯稱兄道弟’這固然把這種思想’發揚到了頂點’同時’更顯明地指出了資產階級所謂平民’原是那些能忠順於他們的草莽英雄’而達到崇拜英雄主義的傾向。所以這裏的平民思想’却又是染上了一些封建色彩的。</p>
<p>其次’我們要提出的’是啼笑因緣中所表現的欣賞主義的戀愛觀。以樊家樹爲中心’本書展開了一幅多角戀愛的圖畫。在三個不同模型的女性中’胡蝶式的何麗娜與十三妹式的關秀姑’其勝過混跡風塵中的沈鳳喜’自不待言。這一方面’固然是他的平民思想的作祟’主要的却是他的欣賞主羲戀愛觀的展開·他愛沈鳳喜’是因爲」她是個聰明君郎’雖然十分寒素’自有一種淸媚態度’可以引動人’「於是便發生憐愛她的意思。這種戀愛觀’正是一般資產階級的公子哥兒的典型戀愛的方式。這種戀愛觀的出發點’乃是否定女子的人格’而以金錢身分爲武器’以欣賞爲歸宿的性愛商品化的必然現象。</p>
<p>另外’由欣賞主義而達到戀愛至上主義。何麗娜爲迎合樊家樹而捐棄豪華生活’學習撲素’終而至於離開家庭。同時’當樊家樹和沈鳳喜最後在柏林裏相會的時候’她說」在從前’女子失身於人無論是願意或者被强迫的就像一塊白布染黑了一樣’可是現在的年頭兒不是那樣說’只要丈夫眞愛他妻子’妻子眞愛她丈夫’受了一點侮辱’却與彼此的愛情一點沒有關係。「這些’都是在極度發揚戀愛至上主義’這種至上主義’也是資產階級戀愛的最高標的。這一點’我以爲在意識上從資產階級的觀點出發’是全書中比較有反封建性觀念的一點　　最後’是小資產階級的復仇主義。作者在啼笑因緣中對於關壽峯和關秀姑的着力描寫’完全是要完成那」山寺鋤奸「的幾個塲面’以及感恩報德的俠義行爲。這種復仇主義的出發’在前面巳經述及’是小資產階級對於現社會不滿的一種政治上的反映。這一思想’在本書中算是最大的污點’而也是使這著作’終成爲傅奇小說最大的缺陷。</p>
<p>話止於此了’本來’如果作爲一篇批評文看是不够的’但限於本欄的規定’、（每篇不能超過三天）也只好就此擱筆。（完）</p>

<h3>靑年煩惱與健康敎育</h3>
<p>— 周尙</p>
<p>（一）煩惱的作崇</p>
<p>靑年、靑年、這名詞多麽甜蜜、多麽可愛、多麽有生氣、多麽有希望、靑年時代是黄金時代、靑年前途是有爲前途、照理、該充滿着喜氣洋洋的情緒、照理、該顯露着興高彩烈精神、然而事實告訴我們不盡是這樣、不少的靑年牢是悉眉不展、牢是垂頭喪氣、好像世界上的不如意都集中在他們的身上、於是有脫離紅塵的厭世、今朝有洒今朝醉的苟且、甚至趨於紙醉金迷的浪漫、殺人放火的惡化、</p>
<p>原因似乎很複雜、但也很簡單、爲甚活潑潑的靑年會變到像這樣的腐化惡化、依我看來、這都是煩惱二字作崇演出來的、因爲靑年時期生理與心理皆呈突變的現象、思想方面易起想入非非的幻想、情緒方面動輒變化無常、一切狀態均顯著地流動步安稳、同時又受到環境的刺戟不絶地侵襲、遂惹起麻般的煩惱、他們整個的身心被煩惱密密層層的包圍着舉目所睹幾無往而非煩惱了、要謀衠出這層包圍、可是到處荊棘、到處此路不通、卒令意志薄弱的靑年無形地釀成江河日下之心、我們要挽救他們、唯有設法解决他們的煩惱、要解决他們的煩惱、惟有找尋煩惱的成因、才可對症下藥、</p>
<h3>（二）煩惱的成因</h3>
<p>固然、靑年的煩惱現象、不一而足、但煩惱的成因、却很明顯、頗具線索可尋、據我分柝的結果、歸納下來總不外後列的三大主要因素、㈠求學問題、㈡職業問題、㈢婚姻問題、靑年有因解决不了這問题的任何一問題或全部分、乃至煩惱叢生、乃至腐化惡化、等到靑年一入岐途、國家社會都蒙無限量的損失、這種損失、什麽東西都贖不回來的、我們萬不可等間漢視、</p>
<h3>（三）煩惱的解除</h3>
<p>煩惱的成因旣獲到了、我們便該應用相當的方法、給他們一條出路、解除他們的倒懸、我覺得」健康敎育「是他們再好不過的出路、健康原是人生的到寳、我們寗可犧牲洋房汽車以及珍珠寳貝、却决不可缺少健康、國家也需要牠、文明也少不了牠、這裏可引用英國首相喬治和心理學者霍爾兩段話、以資證明、喬治說、」不能以三等體格的國民、造成第一等的國家、「霍爾的話是這樣、」有了體格的黄金時代、三十年後、必有一個文化的黄金時代、「這明明說健康是我們富强的鑰匙、自然、煩惱的靑年更要與牠接近、更要當牠珍寳、牠可以救你起死回生、牠可以助你轉危爲安、牠可給你智慧解决求學問題、牠可給你財富解决職業問題、牠可給你美麗解决婚姻問題、如果有人不信、且聽下面的聲述、</p>

<h3>紐約通信　（三）</h3>
<p>— 羅皚嵐</p>
<p>第二封幾首關於中國人的美國流行歌曲</p>
<p>烈文兄：</p>
<p>到美後’卽與此間無線電廣播發生了不解之緣’五年來’買了兩個新的無線電收音機’前後雖花錢不少’甚至設法從每天的房飯錢項下’省出幾文來’還這筆額外的支出’但並非毫無報酬。從無綫電的廣播中’每晚聽到很重要的新聞’尤其是當中日在上海大戰時’幾乎每半小時都有重要的戰績報告；此外’可聽到名人的演講’學校間重要的足球賽。令我最喜歡聽的’是廣播中的音樂’牠給我的安慰不少’海外生活之無聊’老哥是知首的’要不是有了牠’有時这空虚的房子和這寂寞的心會逼得我發瘋的。</p>
<p>在音樂廣播中’最常聽到的’是美國流行的歌曲’這些歌曲除極少數外’是不知作者爲誰的’但牠們很能迎合一般美國人的心理’代表美國人的普通脾胃。有的先在電影的歌舞片中出現過’有的先由紐約的歌舞劇中採用過’然後流入民間’各處音樂隊都奏這曲子。牠們的壽命都不很長’因爲一曲出後’大家都喜歡唱’不到一兩個月’人們便覺得聽厭了’於是許多新的歌曲接着出現。她們的内容多半是關於男女間的愛情’字句全是美國通行的俗語方言’有許多做得很好’但大半是不通’不通’第三個不通’不過音調好聽而已。紐約是這種歌曲流播的中心’許多歌曲是在紐約百老滙路（Ｂｒｏａｄｗａｙ）唱出了名’然後流入各地。百老匯路的人們對於那種歌詠失戀的曲子’呌ＴｏｒｃｈＳｏｎｇ，唱這種歌的人便呌ＴｏｒｃｈＳｉｎｇｅｒ。</p>
<p>我除喜歡聽無線電廣播外’有時又上百老匯路玩玩’買最廉的座位’聽最好的歌舞劇’（所謂歌舞劇者’乃ＭｕｓｉｃａＩｄｒａｍａ或稱ｍｕｓｉｃａｉＳｈｏｗ，切不可與歌劇Ｏｐｅｒａ相混。）因此對於美國流行的歌曲聽得頗多’有時自己也能唱幾句。在這許許多多的流行歌曲中’我聽到了幾首與中國人有關的歌曲。</p>
<p>說起美國普通民衆關於中國的知識’實在貧弱得可憐。他們從傅說中’從電影襄’知道的中國’是一個貧窮’饖荒’充滿了盜賊與内亂的古怪國家。在美國的一切華僑都是殺人的兇犯’雅片烟鬼’雜碎館的工人’洗衣匠。唐人街則是一個烟犯’賭棍’和殺人犯的集塲。這幾首關於中國人的歌曲’也免不了這種色彩。</p>
<p>我所聽到最早的一首關於中國的歌曲’是呌」唐人街’我的唐人街。「（Ｃｈｉｎａ，ｔｏｗｎ，ｍｙＣｈｉｎａｔｏｗｎ，）原歌字句如何’我現在一點也記不得了’大約是不外損中國人的。此後’我便對這種歌曲留意’把牠們的字句一一記下來。現在共集了七首’我把牠們翻譯了出來。原文多方言’極難找得中國的相當字句’在力求不失原意之下’有許多地方我不用直譯的方法。</p>
<p>（一）上海蓮（ＳｈａｎｇｈａｉＬｉｌ）這歌在一個呌ＦｏｏｔｌｉｇｈｔＰａｒａｄｅ的電影片中唱過’後會流行一時。這電影也許現在到了中國。</p>
<p>走盡天下路’爬盡天下山上天’入地’找我的上海蓮。························繁星燦爛於上海天空’帶給我許多驚心回憶’上天’入地’找我的上海蓮。························我知道我愛她’那小妖精不過一隻花蝴蝶’但她的眼光裏流露出眞情。呵’我想忘了她’那有甚麽用？我怎能忘記？上天’入地’找我的上海蓮。</p>
<h3>論文壇上的摩登風氣</h3>
<p>— 古董</p>
<p>不知道從什麽時候起’」才子佳人「又飄飄然起來了。雖未見得痰迷心竅’必嗡嗡嘖嘖有古腔’爲文也必徵引一兩個典故’之乎也者一下子’或又明知故犯’」奉和「若干首’好像這麽一下子便成了淸流。有人說」老調子巳經唱完「’看去好像」未完「也還」不會完「哩！</p>
<p>」考「才子的來源’大槪生於反動思想’因天才甚高’感情激越’不滿意於現狀’而無可奈何’這纔玩世不恭；試看鄭板橋’王仲霍’袁子才’龔自珍’劉鐵雲這班人’便知其風流才子的模樣’另有動機’並非會滿意於風花雪月或醇酒婦人的’稍遠一點的侯方域’便逈乎不如此。</p>
<p>才子的才氣’原來使人受不了’因爲他大槪不曾知道世界上有旁人。」不才子「的才氣呢’更要使人逃跑了’東施也捧心’是最好的譬喻；這又加上了西洋大都巿的頺風’殖民地的野蠻氣分’然後成就了」摩登「風度。　　」摩登「巳激起」破壞者「了’其實破壞者「了’其實破塲團體亦復」摩登「</p>
<p>。此風應還遠歸咎於」曼殊大師「’近代的」幽默「諸公亦復不能辭其咎。弄到靑年男女一個個工悉善病’弱不禁風’口角含牙籤一枚’腋下夾」論語「一卷。沒有一點剛强的氣魄’深遠的思想’大家竟悠悠然於淺淺的溪水裏了</p>
<p>想來這現狀眞使人幽默不得’英華皆聚集在這摩登典型裏’而本身這麽不健康’不出十年’這皆要飄散’凋落。卽時下的摩登人物’也皆到了中年’環境一變更’生活上的負擔一加重’身體一弱’心情也要弄到支離破碎’好像百事不可爲。普淺水之悠悠然亦不可得了。</p>
<p>但漢族原來不如此的’原來勇武’博大’和平。古之文人’雖時常害病’但生命力是强盛的’顧亭林帶過兵’陸游喜歡打虎’便是例子。目前風氣這麽頽靡’是因爲弱者還適宜於生存’沒有辦法’只能在」才子佳人「的狀態中將生命消磨下去’」論語「」人間世「之風行’卽是</p>
<p>這個道理。</p>
<h3>假面具</h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>小的時候喜歡看猴戲’到現在’還隱約可以想起猴戲是怎樣要的。自然’猴子會得做戲是人在指揮的。鑼鼓一嚮’猴子就騎在山羊的背上兜圈子’而有趣的是：這猴子是戴了假面具的。看戲的有大人也有小孩’他們息樣感覺我不曉得；我呢’有一次就以爲騎羊的是人而不是猴子’這是兩歲或者三歲時候的事’當面對帶我去看要猴戲的人說過的。爲什麽呢？因爲猴子帶了假面具的緣故。</p>
<p>但是’猴子究竟是猴了’而且這塲戲明明呌做猴戲；後來也就明白那羊背上的並不是人了。</p>
<p>」是猴子呵！你看有尾巴！「</p>
<p>原來我又發現了尾巴了。</p>
<p>其實戴假面具的不特猴子爲然’人的確也常把自家的眞面目掩藏起來；不過猴子有尾巴’容易被人揭破罷了。</p>
<p>據說歐美的國家都是文明的’尤其是美國’大家都佩服得了不得；别的人不舉’單拿美國回來的博士之類也够足證明’因爲他們開口是美國文明’閉口美國文明’終日崇拜美國人。</p>
<p>」譬如說吧’美國人的監獄也就比中國的乾淨得多了’空氣也；「</p>
<p>不用他說下去’聽的人也總不會不相</p>
<p>信美國的監獄比中國文明。再譬如’美國的死刑非常之少’有之’也用電椅；中國就慘了：槍决是不用說’有時還殺頭！博士於是乎感覺中國之野蠻’而誇示美國的文明了。</p>
<p>起初我也信了這些話’美國究竟不愧爲文明的黄金國；然而到現在！！</p>
<p>我雖無緣到美國去走走’却無意地在上海看了一部影片」亡命者。「這部片的原作者是美國人勞勃本司（Ｒ．Ｅ．Ｂｕｒｎｓ（’他告訴我一件事：騎在羊背上耍戲的不是人’而是戴了假面具的猴子！於是我恍然’我發現了近代資本主義最發達的美國文明原來是這樣的。</p>
<p>」不信嗎？看看Ｃｅｏｇｉａ洲的ＣｈａｉｎＧａｎｇ吧！「我要這樣的揭破這副假面具！</p>
<h3>顏子在陋巷</h3>
<p>— 白戈</p>
<p>從孔廟到孔林’中途得經過一條巷子。雖說是條巷子’其實也就是一條街。在衰老而頑固的曲阜城裏’像這樣的街到是很多的’但因爲據說那就是昔日顏子所在的陋巷’而且當頭又竪着座石質的牌坊’明明在那上面刻着」陋巷「二字’所以我們便通稱爲巷子了’也稱爲」陋巷「。</p>
<p>」陋巷「的確是不愧被稱爲」陋巷「：兩旁的房子就矮小得可憐間’或還嵌着幾梀秃頭的茅屋’一切都表現出一種陋相’在一個未得夫子之道的人定然是眞地不堪其憂的。然而’不改其樂的顏子却早己不在這里而在那皇皇的廟堂之上了廟堂就在」陋巷「出口的上面’一般通稱爲顏廟。紅紅的牆壁’高高的廟門’亦頗能給人一些莊嚴之感’不過沒有孔廟那樣偉大罷了。一進門去’馬上却令人嘗着一種山野的氣味。原來前面是一片廣大的草坪’其中雜着幾許各色各樣的古樹但這是就夏天而說的’如果是在冬天的話’那又是一種荒凉的景象横在我們底目前了’只有那作爲古蹟之一的」陋巷井「才躺在一角表示着一切的存在</p>
<p>井是很深的。上面立着一朶茅亭。也許是因爲被茅亭切斷了光線才使人看爲很深的吧。雖不知當時顏子所飲的水是否就是從這井裏汲出’但至令再沒有人從這井裏汲水而飲却是顯然的事實。我想’如果不是茅亭底周圍有一道欄杆可以供人坐息的話’大約是誰也不會願意在這兒停下。亭邊有一顆古怪的樹’好像是被人精心設計構成出來似地盤旋在亭子上面’看起來到很别緻’只可惜頸上早巳加了鐵圈’不久就要在風雨飄搖之下腐朽了。</p>
<p>到了正殿’拾頭就見着那短命的顏子在雍容地坐着’裝起復聖的樣子。但在這里’却不能引起人們底敬仰’而只能引起一點可憐的同情來。因爲這一座皇皇的廟堂’早已被軍爺們底大砲轟炸成」陋巷「了。龕上頂了一張蔑席’席底四角壓着石頭’只要一望望那可以見着天的屋頂’自然就知道這是爲顏子遮蔽風雨的。再向後面踱去’但見遍地點綴着瓦礫’而那殘存的柱椽還嚙着幾顆尙未爆裂的砲彈’給我們寫出戰爭底遺跡和恐怖。於是’一時不禁從心底湧出了無限的感慨。</p>
<p>」早巳入了廟堂的顏子’至今也被軍爺們底大砲轟得只能仍然在陋巷了’難</p>
<p>道又是他應有的命運嗎？「這是最後浮上我底嘴裏來的一句話。</p>
<h3>西游日錄（九)</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>螺獅旋走完’向一支山角拐過’就到了東天目山門外的西嶺垂虹’實在是一幅畫樣的美景。行入到此’一見了這銀河落九天似的飛瀑’瀑身左右的石壁’以及瀑流平處架在那裏的橋亭丨名垂虹橋亭丨總要大吃一驚’以爲在如此高高的高山中’那裏會有這樣秀灑’淸逸’縹渺的瀑布和建築的呢？我們這一批難民似的遊山者’到了瀑布潭邊’就把饑餓也忘了’疲倦也丢了’文縐縐的詩人模樣做作也說了；蹲下去’跳過來’竟大家都成了頑皮的小孩’天生的蠻種’完全恢復了本來的面目。等到先到寺裏的幾位招呼我們的人出來’呌我們趕快去吃午飯的時候’我們纔一步一回頭地離開了那一條就在山門西面的懸崖瀑布。</p>
<p>離瀑布’過垂虹’拾級而登’在大樹夾道的山門内徑上走里把來路’再上一層’轉一個灣’就到了昭明禪院的内殿。</p>
<p>我們住的客堂’亦卽方丈打坐偃息之房’是在寺的後面東首’係沿厓而築的一間山樓。山房淸潔高敞’紅塵飛不到’雲霧有時來’比之価天目’規模薇略小’然而因處地高’故而淸靜緊密’要勝一籌。東天目并且自己還有發動機’裝有寺内專用的電燈’這一點却和普陀的那個大旅館似的文昌閣有點相像。方丈德明’年輕貎慧’能經營而善交際’我們到後’陪吃飯’陪遊山’談吐之間’就露顯出了他的儘可以做得這一區名山的方丈的才能。查這昭明禪院的歷史丨見東出志丨當然是因昭明太子而來。梁大同間’僧寳誌丨卽誌公丨飛錫居之。元末</p>
<p>毁’明洪武二十年重建’萬歷初双毁’淸康煕年間’臨安黄令倡緣新之。洪楊時’當然又毁滅了’後此的修者汪明’若去一看現存的碑記’自然可以明白。寺的規模’雖然沒有西天目禪源寺那麽的宏大·然天王殿·韋馱殿’大雄寳殿’藏經閣等’無不應有盡有。可惜藏經閣上’並不藏經’是一座四壁金黄的千佛閣’鄕下人稱百子堂’在寺的西面。此外則僧尞不多’全山的茅篷’仰食於總院者’也只有寥寥的幾個’因以知此寺寺產定不如西天目的富而且廣’不過檀主的施捨’善男信女的捐助’一年中也定有可觀’否則裝電燈’營修造的經費’將從何處得來呢？</p>
<h3>農婦</h3>
<p>— 葉華</p>
<p>在那坦蕩的田塲裏’金黄的稻穗’拖住了顫散的夕暉。她一人孤獨地彎着腰手兒不停。讓歲月的辛勞’悄悄磨白了小小的鐮刀。她把稻割下’又一束一束捆好。哼一支小曲’嘆一口氣沉重的脚步拖着污泥。她無限焦憂’手兒不停數數坡上幾隻牛羊’鴉聲飛起。她耳邊猛聽到；（媽’我肚飢！媽’我肚飢！）</p>
<h3>媽媽　（三）</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>在晚飯的時候’女孩子問着爸爸’說麗做會不會唱歌’會不會敎她許多玩意’只有哥哥不說什麽話’他有時對爸爸望望’有時也向妹妹望望。這大孩子的沉默’不能不使父親有點注意’在八歲的孩子心中’一定覺得有第二個母親不是一椿快樂的事吧。父親好幾次望着他想說什麽話’終於不知道說出什麽的好。</p>
<p>晚上父親臨睡時’照例看了看兩個睡熟的孩子’他在大孩子額上吻了一下’輕輕地在嘴裏說：」明’你不要以爲爸爸變了’對爸爸有點生疏起來’爸爸仍舊是往日一樣愛你們的爸爸啊！「他把孩子的手小心着放進了被窩’然後看到那小的一個’她臉子側着’略微張開了嘴’好像還留着白天的快樂。他把那些短髮給他掠開了一點’在她額上也印了一個吻。他自己也就睡去’可是今天的精神太興奮’無論怎樣總不能使自己安靜下來’許多念頭都來擾亂他的心。在孩子面前一旦把藏了許久的心事告白了後’不知怎麽好像自己做下對不起他們的事了。他記得自己常常對孩子們講着亡妻在世的事情’他也常常敎孩子們怎樣紀念母親’想到母親的許多好處’孩子們對於母親的懷念’巳經有深刻的印象。現在一告訴他們麗姑會做他們的母親’那大的孩子不是有點不自然嗎？一向天眞可愛的孩子’父親第一次看見他有這樣不快的感覺’他在這事的進行中’第一次觸到悲哀了。對於亡妻’他是沒有忘記過的’亡妻的笑貎儀態’有那一天他沒有憶念呢！十年的同居’無論怎樣細小的事’他回想起來都覺得十分美麗’妻是那麽嬌美而溫柔的’她常常說這樣一句話：」爸爸’你覺得幸福嗎？「她本來是處處爲他體貼着的’可是’幸福跟着她一塊兒走了。所以對於亡妻留下的孩子’爲了紀念她的緣故’他格外的寵愛’四年的獨身生活中’也多少盡了點母職呢。起初的兩年’無論朋友們怎樣勸解’他總拒絶第二次的結婚’可是那悲哀畢竟也慢慢地淡了下來·而且那獨身生活又告訴了他許多經騐’一個獨身男子的生活’是多麽不自然哪！爲了這兩種原因’這幾月來他和孫麗影十分的接近’那第二次結婚的决心’在兩星期前定下了。</p>

<h3>癆病與社會濟下</h3>
<p>— 翁之龍</p>
<p>德國可以算是歐洲極講衛生的國家了’從統計上看起來’德國人肺癆病的死亡在中等社會的人民的統計上看’一八九三年（四十年以前）每一萬人口中因癆病而死的佔二六人’一九零三年（三十年以前）二○’七人；一九一三年（民國二年卽二十年以前）一四·三人’由此可以知道癆病死亡逐年减少了’後來到了歐戰末年（民國七年卽一九一八年）人民因糧食缺乏得癆病死亡的驟然增加’有一萬人口達到二十三人之多’停戰後自勵行防癆的辦法以來’每一萬人口中癆病的死亡僅佔八人了’諸位！這就是德國防癆的成績’其他各國如英’法’意’奧’比’荷蘭’匈牙利等國的政府’都在那兒積極的提倡衛生’人民方面也多有防癆會的工作’他們各國癆病死亡的統計’一年少一年’回想我們中國眞是可憐啊’無辜寃死的不知有多少’所以現在上海有創辦中國防癆恊會之舉巿長吳鐵城先生’非常贊成’竭力提倡’他是防癆會的會長’我們醫學界的人也大家都願意出力’還希望有錢的人多出幾個錢’大家負起責任來幹這件事’所謂」天下興亡匹夫有責「’一個人誰都要想保護自己的生命’保護子孫的生命’這種工作就是保護自己’保護兒孫’保護全民族生命的一個重大的工作’我希望各界同胞’大家共同努力’一致參加’把這件事辦好！</p>
<p>癆病很容易蔓延’是一種」貧民病「與經濟方面有密切的關係’在上面已經講過’據Ｃｅｂｈａｒｄ氏所定的原則’生活收入愈低微的人們’癆病死亡率愈高’收入愈豐富的人們’癆病死亡率愈低’保壽險的公司方面也有同樣的報告’牠說凡付給保險費愈低微的人’癆病死亡的多’付給保險費愈高的人’癆病死亡的愈少’因經濟的壓迫’致染癆病的’這是普通的現象’除此以外’還有三件事’是與經濟有問接關係的就是」食「」住「」工作「’現在再把這三件事講講。</p>
<p>㈠工作丨德國癆病死亡的統計’城巿比鄕村多’而工業區比城巿鄕村更多’因爲工業區空氣’衣’食’住等多不適宜工作又甚繁重’因此由癆病死亡的很多’尤其在歐戰時’德國婦女因癆病而死的特别增加’因爲那個時候’男子出外參戰’女子一方面時時牽掛着’不能安心’一方面還要爲國家工廠工作’工作和心境都非常的不良’患癆病的所以就增加起來了’來他各種職業也有重大的關係’如灰塵工作’棉花匠’石匠等，都是有害於呼吸器的容易得着癆病’又如皮鞋匠’裁縫匠’因常常灣腰駝背的作工’也是容易得癆病的’這都是因工作過度而得癆病的’因工作而癆病蔓延及死亡的。</p>
<p>㈡食丨營養與結核病（卽癆病）有深切的關係’德國天歐戰時’精神病院與其他醫院内’癆病的死亡率佔百分之五十’這是受敵人的封鎖’糧食缺乏和限制所演成的’又戰時城巿癆病死亡也比較的多’因爲鄕間尙有農產品以及農人所養的家禽等肉類食物’可以得着一些滋養’城巿中人雖有錢亦不易購買’並且受了食料的限制’是非常缺乏的’Ｗａｓｓｅｒｍａｕｕ的調查’歐戰時因爲糧食缺乏國家實行限制食料’施用卡片’每减少食料一次’人民的癆病死亡率就增加一次’此種關係卽可證明因飲食不良能影響癆病的蔓延和死亡的。</p>
<p>㈢住丨德國戰前城巿住宅因人口增加已感覺缺乏戰後在各殖民地的德人一律回國’再加上戰士歸來’眞有屋荒的現象’戰前時屋頂地窖向不住人的’也要住人了’並且數人住在一間房子裏空氣非常之壞’癆病死亡的增加’這也是一個最大的原因。還有戰後人民窮苦’加之煤料缺乏’貧苦的人民不易生火爐’因感冒變結核病的非常之多’同時因經濟不良’食料與營養的不足’癆病的蔓延更爲容易了。</p>
<p>住宅與癆病的傳染有莫大的關係’一九一八年德國柏林巿的報告’巿民死於肺癆及喉頭癆的有四千九百四十三人’其中死於病院的佔二千五百四十六人’其餘死在住宅約計二千三百九十七人’這二千三百九十七人的死亡者的住宅’分類來說是。</p>
<p>一家有一室的住宅估一百零九人一家有二室的住宅佔七百八十二人一家有三室的住宅佔九百七十六人一家有四室的住宅佔三百十二人一家有六室的住宅佔三十人一家有七室及七室以上的住宅佔十三人</p>
<p>以上二千三百九十七人的住宅中死者與生存者每宅中人數若干’統計起來是：</p>
<p>一　人住宅　　一○七人　　二人住宅　　四二五人　　三　人住宅　　五九八人　　四人住宅　　五七五人　　五　人住宅　　三二八人　　六人住宅　　一七○人　　七　人住宅　　六十五人　　八人住宅　　三十四人　　九　人住宅　　八人　　　　十人住宅　　三人　　　　十一人住宅　　一人</p>
<p>由此可以知道凡住宅小而人數多的’也是癆病的死亡一個原因。</p>
<p>看了以上的情形’就知道防止癆病除提高經濟狀况外·食·住·工作三件事尤須要注意改良。</p>
<p>剛才我所講的是癆病和經濟的關係’以及癆病因社會關係而發生的原因’現在我再把防癆會預備的工作談談。</p>
<p>㈠普及全國防癆敎育丨目的在使人人知道癆病的厲害’個個有衛生防癆的知識和决心預備發行雜誌刋製圖畫小册子’編製各級學校的衛生防癆敎材’送各書店採用；請醫生到各校講演’並組織學生夏季演講的宣傳隊；發行防癆日曆’贈送會員’並出售；攝製電影等等事體’都想一一作到’使大家都有衛生防癆的知識’促進他們的防癆的决心。</p>
<p>㈡設立預防院及療養院丨如早期診斷’早期療養’早期防養等’都在我們計劃之中’預備聯絡各醫院試騐所從事舉辦；並且想設立肺病療養院’兒童夏令營’兒童防癆院等’積極的帮助各界同胞男婦老幼去驅除癆病。</p>
<p>㈢設立免費診所丨目的在救濟貧苦的大衆’使他們（就是無錢的）有醫治癆病的機會’阻止癆病的蔓延。</p>
<p>㈣研究工作丨如結核素試騐診斷的研究等’都是要積極的去作的。</p>
<p>這些事體’於防癆方面是非常重大’都是應當舉辦的’不過在我們中國辦起來’是極其困難’不容易辦好的’還希望各界同胞多多帮助’能够使他一一完成’以達到救國家救民族的目的’諸位女士！諸位先生！熱心努力來和我們一齊奮鬥吧！</p>
<h3>皮膚病常識　（下）</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>第四’皮膚有呼吸作用。普現的人。只知道脚能呼吸。不知道皮膚也能呼吸的。不過分量自然沒有肺那樣的我。但是水蒸氣的蒸發是很多的。黄梅時節的氣候。並不如炎夏時節的熱。然而吾人覺到蒸悶的不適。遠勝於炎夏。這就是用爲黄梅時節空中的濕氣太甚。皮膚上分水分的蒸發。受着限止的緣故。</p>
<p>第五’皮膚有吸收作用。凡是容易氣化的藥品。或是溶解於脂肪中的藥品。皮膚都能够吸收。這一點對於皮膚病的治療上。是委緊要的。</p>
<p>第六’皮膚有掩護身體的作用。皮膚除了上面所講各種機能以外。還能掩覆筋骨和利用他的彈力性。可以抵抗衛外界一切的傷害。譬如受着打撲或是壓迫的時候。利用皮膚的皮下脂肪層。可以抵禦外力。保衛内部重要器管的損傷。對於細菌的侵害。利用表皮的角層。可以防衛。所以只要皮膚沒有損傷。細菌是不能侵襲的。倘使有一細小的破裂。细菌就可以乘機侵入。到血液與淋巴液。循環到全身。發生致命的敗血症膿毒症等等。</p>
<p>上面已經從皮膚生理上和解剖上的特點。說明皮膚是身上的一種重要器官。那末對於第二個問題。就是皮膚有病是否應當醫治的。不消再說了。可是一般世谷的人。往往誤以爲醫好了皮膚病以後。有體内的病毒。不能够排泄到外面。發生病毒内攻的米信。譬如甲說道。吾有一個親戚。他患了皮膚病。給醫生治好了。隔了幾何時日。就發生内病。等到皮膚病再來。他的内病就好了。好似一個眞確的憑據。是再不能動搖的了吾現在用淺近的學理和譬喻來說給諸位聽罷。凡是一個人。生了一種慢性病以後。好似身體上習慣了一樣。等到身體上有變動的時候。原來習慣的情形。就會發生變化。譬如有慢性皮膚病的人。遇到熱性病的時候。平常覺到癢的。忽然不癢了。流黄水的。也忽然不流了。等到寒熱退去。癢也來了。黄水也流了。恢復到從前一樣的情形了。從學理上講起來。這是因爲身體内部的發炎。把皮膚表面的充血。暫時减退下去。或則因體溫上升。發生多數的抗毒素。來把病毒減滅。吾人往往遇到淋病的人。本來流出大量的膿汁。忽然發生了副睪丸炎。膿汁就一時減少起來。等到副睪丸炎的熱度退了。膿就依然分泌。也是一樣的道理。所以吾人要明白皮膚病的變動是果。内病是因。並非因皮膚病的治愈。引起内病。是因内病的發生。皮膚病暫時隱退。假如有一個喜歡吸烟飲酒的人。汪幸地發生内病。他就不歡喜吸烟和飲酒。等到病好了。他仍舊一樣</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>地吸烟了飲酒了。難道你也可以講他因爲不吸烟不飲酒發生内病的嗎。也不過因爲習吸烟飲酒之後。遇到了身體上有變故的時候。他的習慣就變換罷了。也就是内病是因。吸烟飲酒是果。但是還有一種人講皮膚病不醫好。也不覺得有甚麽大的害處。這也是錯誤的觀念。吾人往往遇到小兒頭部的濕疹。因爲不去醫治。膿痂堆積。發生寒熱。常常有引起急性腦膜炎的危險。還有疥癬’癢疹等等。長久放任了以後。往往因化膿菌的傳染。發生重症的膿痂疹。甚至發生腎臟炎。所以世俗以皮膚病看作無足輕重的病。豈不是大大的誤謬嗎。</p>
<h3>母乳爲營養嬰兒之天然妙品</h3>
<p>— 瞿紹衡</p>
<p>國民者。國家之本也。民健則國强。民病則國弱。是以國之强弱。實以民之健否爲衡。民之健否。須從幼時保育之得法與否而判也。嬰兒保育之法。至多且繁。然其中最主要者。莫如營養。試觀今日之一般患病嬰兒。十之八九爲食物不適所致。輕者碍其發育。而養成病弱之國民。重者傷其身命。而殘害國家之分子。欲救國者。可不注意於嬰兒之營養乎。</p>
<p>嬰兒營養法。别爲天然營養與人工營養二種。天然營養者。以母乳或乳母營養之謂也。人工營養者。以人乳以外之物質卽獸乳（馬牛羊等）或其他乳粉糕餅等營養之謂也。天然營養以母乳爲最佳。蓋母乳性同母血。俗有白色血液之稱。胎兒在母體内。旣藉母血生活。則其後自當以母乳營養。易以他物。必難消化。緣初生兒消化力薄弱。其母乳之成分。正適合於嬰兒之生理。且因含有鹽類。故并有瀉下之功。三四日後。嬰兒漸長。則乳質漸變。濃度漸增。嗣後嬰兒之發育。日新月異。而乳中所含之蛋白質。脂肪。含水炭素。糖。鹽等成分之質量。除母體有特别原因。或疾病外。均隨嬰兒之發育程度。繼續增長。而以應所需。據精確之調查報告。初產兒之體質與次產兒及再次產兒各不相同。其乳質之性質成分。亦各殊異。故乳母之乳亦無母乳之適合也。反之。人工營養所用之食品。近來雖有各種改良之乳粉。然其内容之性質。終不能有母乳之精確的變化。且因小兒胃腸往往因食物之溫度性質成分等微細變化而起障碍。例如調治汪當。冷熱不匀。多少無定。則消化發育均蒙其害。人工營養品質。種類繁多。不遑枚舉。其比較的適合於嬰兒者。首推羊乳。驢馬乳次之。牛乳又次之。其他乳粉糕餅更其次矣。查世之應用最廣者。厥推牛乳。蓋以其獲得最易也。茲試以入乳與牛乳之優劣比較言之。人乳之蛋白質少。糖量多。乳球小。消化易。牛乳之蛋白質多。糖量少。乳球大。消化難。觀乎嬰兒吐出物中之凝固片。人乳營養者小。牛乳營養者大。是證嬰兒胃液中所有鹽酸以外之蛋白質消化醱酵素。其對於人乳中之蛋白質消化雖强。而對於牛乳中之蛋白質消化則弱也。又試以百分之十之』亞母尼亞『水加於倍量之人乳。而溫至攝氏六十度。則呈赤色。牛乳則無所反應。以同量之愈瘡醇及雙養水二三滴。加於牛乳則呈靑色。人乳則無所反應。是乃人乳與牛乳化學的反應不同之明證也。嬰兒生後。數日之内。體重每每减少。其减少之程度。及恢復所需日期。母乳營養者少而速。牛乳營養者多而遲。以種種不利於生理之食品。用以哺育胃腸抵抗薄弱之嬰兒。宜其陷於消化不良而貧血衰弱也。更進一步而從生物學的關係以言之。凡各種動物之乳汁。均含有一種特異之毒素。本種動物食之。可由其先天之抗毒素抗抵。他種動物食之。則須另生抗毒物質以抗之。嬰兒體力纎弱。產生抗毒。物質之能力有限。或能盡力抗此食物之毒素。然遇有他毒或病菌侵入時。則無餘力抵抗。而病乃作矣。且牛乳自擠出時起。迄入嬰兒口腔之時止。其間幾經手續。細菌侵入之機會極多。細菌侵入之機會旣多。則消毒勢難周密。我國人民。對於科學之常識淺微。普通可以視爲消毒法者。不過煮沸而已。詎知煮沸消毒。對於牛乳之弊甚多。沸則蛋白質凝固。其他成分變性而不易消化。不沸則消毒不全。終致貽害。其危險之最大者。爲飲病牛之乳。而感染各種疾病。旣明乎牛乳之不利。則其他代用品更無論矣。抑又言者。母乳營養。不特有益於嬰兒。亦且有利於母體。蓋哺乳之刺戟。可以促子宮之收縮。可以利惡露之排泄。可以催食慾之增加。可以全身之復原。利兒益母。實兩全之營養法也。世之舍母乳營養而取人工營養者。愚孰甚焉。近代婦女。耽樂偷安。醉心社會。力爭平權。認生產爲苦事。置育兒於不管。口喊救國之高調。而實施滅種之手段。泰西學者。早已有鑑於人工營養之不利。而力行校整其國内之宿弊矣。國人其猶執迷而不醒乎。或白鄕里俗婦。固什九乳哺育者也。何以嬰兒之死亡總數反較城巿爲多。予曰不然。此乃婦女缺乏保育常識。以致乳哺不得其時。保育不得其法。良以母乳哺兒。法至簡便’遂致一聞兒啼。卽以乳塞其口。而杜其聲。固汪問其哭因之爲饑爲寒爲癢爲痛。或曾有所欲也。兒雖不受。亦必勉强予之。不知乳汁入胃。人乳須一小時半乃至二小時。牛乳二小時半乃至三小時。而始克完全消化。故若不待其消化完畢。而繼續予之。則消化之機能。永無休息之期矣。胃腸安得而汪病。尤在疾病之際。往往因疾苦而多哭。因多哭而多食。哭時與食。殊易致病。勉强予食。尤害胃腸。且病中各種機能减退。消化小當然不能獨異。故病中多食。實有促進病機垂入危境之害。若是者。雖母乳萬善。亦不能謂爲無弊矣。</p>

<h3>德國巴斯德研究院院長魯愛彌（Ｅｍｉｌｅ　Ｒｏｕｘ）傳略</h3>
<p>— 朱家健</p>
<p>（四）血淸製造所之參觀　　今茲製造治療白喉血淸之所。原爲Ｖｉｌｌｅｎｅｕｙｅ　ｌＥｔａｎｇ府第。昔法皇拿坡嵛第三曾與其后Ｅｕｇｅｎｉｅ在此度其蜜月。久後歸爲公家所有。嗣於一八八三年由敎育部贈與巴斯德醫士作爲研究大癲症之所。及魯醫士在布達貝斯脫大會發表動人宣言之後由研究所之董事會决定。將該處作爲製造治療白喉血淸之所。於是化騐室與馬厩皆成立焉。但不久之後。在該處亦製造治療他種病症之血淸。共多至十餘種。故今所養之馬亦多至四百匹。此次導余參觀血淸製造所之勒梅德崖君。卽爲該所之副所長。勒君爲余述製造血淸方法之大略如次。</p>
<p>欲得某種血淸。須先將特種」抗毒素「（Ａｎｔｌｇｅｎｅ）注射入馬身。注射之法。係用皮下或血管注射兩法。所用之抗毒素分量。先少後多。至於第一次手續時期之久長。則視欲得何種血淸而各異。最短則數星期。最久則數月不等。及至末次注射抗毒素後十二十五日間。則爲第一次取血之期。每取約七立脫。以玻璃缸接受。取血時間以早晨馬未進食之時爲宜。大概七時至十時之間也。四日之後。再行取血一次。然後使該馬休養一星期。嗣後在兩星期之中。爲之注射抗毒素三四次。經末次注射後。十二十五日之間。再行取血。該血淸製造所之盛血玻璃缸。多至六百件。皆用蒸壓氣消毒。每星期取得之血。約爲一千四百立脫。然可提得之血淸。僅達半數而已。取血之後。卽將玻璃缸運入溫度低而氣候無變動之地窖中。待血凝結時。卽有淸液浮在血面。此卽血淸。取血四日後。卽爲採取血淸之時。採得後尙須試騐該血淸之特種免疫能力。試騐之法有二。其一純屬化騐室之工作。卽用物理化學之反應法。此法用以試騐治療白喉之血淸。其第二試騐法。卽在動物身中試騐。卽用天竺鼠以試騐之。凡爲試騐其他各種血淸。則皆用此法。天竺鼠銷路之廣。由此可見。故在血淸製造所中養有天竺鼠數千頭。</p>
<p>凡取得之血淸。則存於冷處。卽在地窖中。該處之溫度永不超過四度。所儲之玻璃缸多至數千件。内中有存儲之血淸。爲煉性者可保存至數年之久。且有血淸可以用蒸壓氣煉乾。運送至各屬地。當用時則再化開。</p>
<p>㈤自血淸治療法而演進爲</p>
<h3>預防法</h3>
<p>魯醫士曾於一八八九年之記載中。書有一語」設或一日有人以此毒素及其附屬品作爲預防之用云云。「豈知自一九二四年以來。此言果騐。蓋有魯醫士之親族拉孟醫土。屢經試騐之後。曾發明」無毒素「（Ａｎａｔｏｘｉｎｅ）。卽今時常用以預防白喉者是也。今簡略言之。所謂無毒素者。卽白喉毒素之化體。自成一種無毒新體質。而爲免疫最有力之藥品</p>
<p>嗣後又根據化白喉毒素爲無毒素之同樣原則。而將他種毒素。如法變化而製成痢疾等病之預防藥。</p>
<p>以目下而言。巴斯德研究院自四年以來。已供給世界各地所用之白喉預防藥多至十二噸。以人數而計。則已用此藥免疫者約有五百萬人以上矣。</p>
<p>據上述各節。可見魯醫士之血淸治療法。經後人之推進及更變。而仍在法國及世界的科學中發其光彩。惟有一事引起吾注意者。卽今之生理學家。日益以預防法更代治療法矣。按最先發明預防法者。爲法國之冉奈醫土。從無意中得之。其時爲一七九六年。然須待巴斯德大醫士之研究。（一八六四年）而始入學理之途。嗣於一八八一年巴氏第一次使用預防藥。自是而後。各研究家似應向此途前進矣。惟因受魯醫士之影響。故當時二十年中之醫士。皆不以預防爲務。而專以血淸治療爲本。歐戰以前。因曾有專家研究預防傷寒結核等病之方法。但大戰以後。方爲預防法之進展時期。於是戈爾梅特醫士之結核預防藥。及拉孟醫士之白喉預防藥出現於世。而施其靈效焉。今若問血淸治療法興預防法二者之中。究以可者爲可取。吾人以爲此種討論。乃係研究院之事。吾人所知者卽以病而言。二者皆在可取之例也。惟據衛生學家之例而言。則預防勝於治療。但魯醫士之功績。一如巴斯德大醫士無異。對於後來之研究家。乃能保存其相當之勢力。或且爲時亦甚久。蓋魯氏旣發明毒素之後。又能預料其能爲預防法之用。而爲後進之輩開闢新蹊徑。此則魯氏精神永不磨滅之所在也。</p>

<p>結核症死亡旣有上列的驚人數目’那末他究竟發生在身體那一部分呢？我們要嘵得’結核菌是任何身體部分，幾乎都被侵襲的。但此中患者最多的，當然是肺結核一症了，他差不多佔一切結核症百分之九十以上的。另外的像喉結核，腸結核，患者也不少；但這二者大半係肺結核合併症之一，單獨發生的機會，係比較少一點。如果結核菌竄入循環器裹面，則發生急性粟粒結核，這是急性傳染病之一種。在内臟方面的肋膜腹膜，侵襲的機會，固然是很多了；但肾臟泌尿器乳腺甲狀腺脾臟肝臟等各方面，明顯的例證，也是不少的。還有和肺結核不發生密切關係的，則有皮膚結核，皮下組織結核，肌肉結核，粘液囊結核，淋巴管腺結核，骨結核，關節結核，腱結核，胰腺結核，等種種；此中像狼瘡，胯關節炎，龜背，等諸症，都是很重要的。這許多結核種類，當然使讀者目迷五色的；所以本文也就暫時割愛而專述肺結核一症了。</p>
<p>國内的出版物中，對於結核病的著作，差不多已有好幾種了。但一部分是供給醫校課本，或參考之用的；這裹面大半是專門術語太多，説理太嫌高深的。當然非普通一般人所可看得懂的。另外的通俗的小册子也不能説没有，但大多數係偏重一方面，很少全部的叙述的。報章上所登載的，當然是更加瑣碎了。我自己很知道學力不充分，並且係診餘所寫，很難一一覆檢原書的；但普通一般病家，係連這一點常識’大半還是不了解的；這一種通俗文字’當然是非常要求的。所以我也大胆的將這篇供本刋地位發表了。</p>
<p>最後’我對於通俗醫學文字’還有一點意見’貢獻給讀者們。我覺得做這類文字’並不是將原書上所列症象診斷治療等種種詳情’一概加以簡短的叙述’就算數的；這樣一來’不是成爲」袖珍臨診秘典「了嗎？譬如在每一病症症象中’有許多名詞’在醫學書祇須寫出’已經看得懂了；但在通俗文字中’非不厭繁瑣’詳加說示’係不行的。另外的’像治療上所述的用藥注射手術等情’係醫者本身事；在通俗文字中’應該從略的。所以這一篇淺說’並不是肺癆全書的簡編’更不是習醫入門’祇希望讀者對於肺結核病’從此有一個明確的認識；未病時知攝生之大概’已病後不至過事張惶’亂投藥劑’致尋常病况亦陷於不治’則作者幸甚。</p>
<p>第一章　結核菌</p>
<p>在叙述本病症的最初’我想讀者或須先要問：這病症究竟是什麽原因呢？這一個問題’當然不是非科學醫所可解决的。我國民間’素來有一種」癆虫「的傳說；并且說：在病人死後’則」癆虫「由喉間外出’故在此時極易傳染云云。這種話’面子上’似乎和我們所說的細菌有些相彷彿’其實絲毫沒有事實上的根據’可聞而不可見的；那當然談不到學術上的價値了。在歐洲的醫學界’對於肺結核症’老早已有人在研究了；但對於他的原因’總回答不出一個所以然。一直到了西歷一八八二年’離現在不過五十年光景’德國大醫學家考后Ｒ．Ｋｏｃｈ　氏發見結核菌後’這一個問題’纔算有」水落石出「滿意的答覆。</p>
<p>結核菌的形態是細桿狀’故又名結核桿菌。他大約有二’五　Ｍｉｋｒｏｎ　長（Ｍｌｉｋｒｏｎ　卽一耗千分之一）’差不多和紅血球直徑三分之一相彷彿；這樣狀態’和梅毒病菌呈螺旋狀’淋菌呈球狀’是完全不同的；但和麻瘋病菌是狠類似的。他是不能運動的’在外面係有脂狀或蠟狀物質被覆的；所以抵抗力是很强的。普通的幾種消毒藥’完全可以拿來作例證的；像百分之五的石炭酸水’如果和本病的痰來混合’須二十四小時以上方死亡的’百分之五或百分之十的克來沙爾水也是一樣。尋常的昇汞水’是更加沒有効果了’福爾馬林的蒸氣消毒法’總算是很完備法子了’但對於乾痰裏面的結核菌’也是沒有辦法的。但他有一個最大的敵人’這就是無人不需的日光了！他對他的抵抗力’是很弱的；在强度下’幾乎是曝之立死’但像乾燥塵埃裏面’或日光不充足的地方’他仍舊可以保持生活的。</p>

<p>至於那丙司機呢？事實上只是甲乙兩人的替班而已。要如他們中有人想休息的話’便由他補上去；假使需要休息的是甲司機’那末實在開車的職務便由乙司機走上去接替’而把乙司機所遺下的職務’讓丙司機代掌。</p>
<p>其次讓我再講火夫的情形。他們一起是四個’丨始終是戴着朝帽’套着朝靴’而又穿着太監的服式。丨暫時也把甲乙丙丁來代表。甲火夫是實現負責照管爐火的人。乙火夫却毫無所事地閒着’一直到甲火夫需要休息的時候’才由他上去接替。丙火夫的工作是把後面煤水車上的煤’剷到前面來’使甲火夫可以取來加進爐子中去。丁火夫是站在煤堆的上面’用一柄短短的小剷’把高頭的煤’剷到下面來’使丙火夫不必費什麽力’就可以把煤輸送給甲火夫。但是我們不妨想想看：那個丁火夫所處的地位是何等的尷尬？他旣不能站着’因爲煤堆太高’車子一顚一跛’豈不要跌下來；他又不能坐着’因爲這是違反太后的命令的。那末怎麽樣呢？當然’他只有用半坐半站的方式’老是蹲着了。所以’他的工作是特别的慢’而且還要時時照顧着自己的安全。</p>
<p>這樣’一切的動作都依着宮中的儀式演出來了。我想在事前’這些人定曾受過幾天的特别訓練的。我也曾幾次上那機關車上去觀看過’只見那些人都是悉眉苦臉地很不高興的樣子。（一七）</p>

<h3>湖筆</h3>
<p>— 顔</p>
<p>前在」上海之日本筆店「一文裏’我曾說到着連之筆’與微墨並稱’馳譽久遠之湖筆’就是這湖屬一鄕鎭的善連所產之筆。</p>
<p>善連全鎭居户百數十家’大都賴製筆以謀溫飽’街頭巷尾’望衡對宇’滿目筆作塲’或在揀毛’或在製筆頭’或在修毫與上膠’男女工友’終朝栗六。這許多筆作塲’規模大的僱工二三十人’小的僅二三人。乃是自己人做做吃吃的</p>
<p>講到營業’現在眞是大不景氣了！湖筆之銷路’從前北至遼吉’西至川中’南及南洋羣島’長江黄河珠江三大流域更不必說’一年中金錢流入這小小的善連鎭’眞是爲數驚人’使善連鎭人都得豐衣飽食’現在’巿塲還是從前的巿塲’可是銷出的數量却大大地減少了。雖然全鎭一年還有兩萬金收八’但每家平均不足兩百金’試問怎够一家八口溫飽之用呢？其中若沈如松幾家’因出品較佳’交易較大’無奈開支也大’仍是得不償失。</p>
<p>湖筆營業之所以昔盛今衰’無疑的是外來之鋼筆鉛筆佔有它的領域了’當此提但國貨年頭’握筆至此’又那能不感慨係之呢？</p>

<h3>美國股票恐慌之檢討</h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>㈠嘗一再論遠美國之證劵統制政策（見本刋第五十九期及六十四期拙稿）’而此等政策’一言以蔽之’卽　股票恐慌之對策而巳。蓋美國證劵市塲上’惟股票占最要地位’　票爲數殊鮮’無足輕重：此亦美國證劵市塲之二特　。在先前二文中’雖屢屢提及股票價格滲落（股票恐慌）爲經濟恐慌之厲階；然僅僅提及而已’對其事實之推進’未暇詳說。本篇之作’卽所以彌補此缺陷’彙集材料’專致力於股票恐慌事實之記述’使研究美國證劵投資制度者’獲得更深一層之瞭解。夫證劵市塲之基礎’築諸一國國民經濟之動態上’證劵市塲之漲落’卽爲整個國民經濟系統變動之指標。故吾人於此檢討美國股票恐慌’實際上亦卽同時觀察其國經濟恐慌之進程也。</p>
<p>㈡一九二九年九月之大恐慌’爲美國股票市塲崩潰之開始’其特徽爲價格極端暴落與亘長期而不恢復’實爲前所未覯者。溯諸美國證券史’當以一八五七年與一八九三年二次恐慌爲最劇’然當時價格慘落雖足驚人’而恢復欃速’爲害較淺。戰後景氣之雲’籠罩金圓帝國主義之王境’迨一九二○年春突發股票恐慌’影響所及’亦匪淺鮮；然其不足與今次恐慌等量齊觀’至爲明顯。今則不然’其深刻化之程度’有與日共進之勢’價格之跌落’破前此之紀錄。吾人試行檢討紐約股票交易所之主力股票變動之勢’卽可舉一反三明其概要矣。丨丨丨</p>

<p>曩治景氣變動之學’知一市塲信用極度發展’物價（股票價格亦在内）極端高漲之時’無啻經濟恐慌之預兆。揆諸美國股票市塲’可信其言之不虚。蓋反動力與正動力適成比例’股票價格愈高’下瀉之勢亦愈烈。九二九年所創爲最高紀錄’恐慌暴發’一落千丈’不可收拾’一九三三年創最低紀錄。兩相比較’其下落至十分之一者’不足爲奇。尙有跌至二十分之一’三十分之一者’其最甚者暴落至百分之一！如上表中之固特異’南太平洋’沙斯羅勃克’巴提摩等卽低落至十五分之一或二十分之一不等。其低落至百分之一者’爲密勒兹鐵道股云。</p>
<p>若從各公司之收益額觀之’則客歲之股票價格暴落之程度’實爲前此所未經見。過去之經濟恐慌怒潮中’反動越急之時’必招致反動之反動’股票價格得以昇騰。今則不然’其下落之勢’跌無限止’至去年下中期始稍安定。計自一九二九年九月起至該時止’其間約亘三年半之久。而去年之最低額’其低於收益額尤比比皆是</p>
<p>迨去歲三月羅斯福掌政’銳意於金融復興’復於同年五月’實施一九三三年之聯邦證劵法結果事業界與金融界’漸有轉入佳境之象。吾人試將各報一國際商業電訊一中’證券項下之紐約證券市價報告與上揭表比較’卽見本月十日杜邦顏料收盤價巳達九七·七五·較去年最低價高六六·六二五：通用汽車亦漲至三八’八七五·較去年高二八一八七五：紐約中央鐵道爲三六·六二五·漲二二·六二五；（該日　　　　　　　　　日報惟哈德森鐵道·巴捉摩鐵道’南太平洋鐵道諸種設票’迄無起色耳。</p>
<p>㈢美國之股票價格’爲何一致的作空前之暴落？且其暴落期間’互數年之久而不衰’吾人欲明瞭其原因’實有一述股票恐慌前美國事業界狀態之必要。蓋股票市塲原以企業界爲基礎’吾人已屢屢述及。而此次（一九二九年）之股票大跌落’一言以蔽之’卽爲一九二一年至一九二九年間美國企業界事業異常之發展之反動耳。故資本主義之内在的矛盾’爲以含理之生產’作不合理之分配’由是釀成生產與消費間之不均衡’與乎一事業間與他事業間之不均衡’經濟恐慌’早基固於是矣。</p>
<p>當夫胡佛總統握政時’美國實業界因機械應用日廣’科學的經營見諸實施’生產極度膨脹’輸出貿易日進千里。故國内學者盛唱永久繁榮之說’視經濟循環說若敝　。胡佛總統倡之於上’事業家促之於下’生產大事擴張’新資本發行額與輸出入貿易日在增長’是誠爲黄金時代。</p>

<p>㈣美國事業界中’以電燈’水道瓦斯’電話等公共事業與鐵道公司基礎最爲强固’每年所獲利益尤厚。然揆諸上表’則此鐵道公司之營業狀况’亦有一年不如一年之勢。夷考厥因’蓋由於汽車業異常發達之故。美國汽車業雖僅有三十年之歷史’而蔚爲世界之一大企業’其呑併鐵道公司之領域’實易想見’現美國汽車數’供乘用者二千萬輛’供運貨用者七百萬輛’合計二千七百萬輛。此龐大之數字’實足驚倒鐵道公司之股東。最要者’爲鐵道公司最近負債之　增。一九三一年以來’鐵道公司總借欵額當在百三十億圓’按鐵道總資產不過約爲二百四十億元’而負債適達半額’利息負擔日增’而所獲純益日减’是則目前鐵道股雖幸有起色’往後終有同歸於盡之日。</p>
<p>汽車業之發達’係賴呑噬鐵道而自肥’由是釀成鐵道股票之低落’吾人上已述之矣。然經濟恐慌之來臨’固無獨惠於此業’汽車業公司之股票’其價格之變動亦最烈。汽車工業’以一九二九年爲一轉換期’同年所獲純利’計逹三億五千七百萬元’迨一九三二年不但無赢餘’反虧折至五千萬元之鉅。至去年營業狀况’可於汽車大王之語中知之。彼會　人由：」德吾個人經　’去年每輛新車’須虧折五十元美金。「無怪乎此舉食　日之大事業家’對羅斯福憤慨不已’對產業復興法案及其他路設施尤多　視也。</p>
<p>鋼’鐵股票之暴落’亦不亞於鐵道股興汽車股。其中以阿納康達鋼興合衆鋼鐵爲最甚。前者在一九二九年最高額爲百四十元’一九三三年低至四·一二五元’計跌落至三十四分之一。鋼鐵股亦自二六一·七五元降至二三·三七五。在利得方面觀察’則全鋼鐵業一九二九年獲利三億二千萬元’一九三二年則有一億二千萬元之虧折。在生產方面’則一九二九年鑄鐵鋼鐵合計九千三百一十九萬噸’一九三二年爲二千二百萬噸’約减百分之七十六。鋼之產額’一九二九年爲三十億零二百萬磅’一九三二年則不過五億一千萬磅’約减四分之一。</p>
<p>最後吾人對於公共事業公司之股票（公用股）尙須略叙數言。美國事業界中’本以此爲基根最穩固’然其股票價格之變動’其結果亦極可慘也。</p>
<p>公用股包括電報’電話’自來水’瓦斯’電氣等。因特種關係’每年純利尙佳’一九三二年爲四億八千六百萬元’較一九二九年已約减二億元。至股票價格方面’則俱有低落之勢。舉統一煤氣股而言’一九二九年爲一八三’二五元’去年降至三四元。美國電報電話股亦有二三二·五○元跌至七○·二五元。其他各種股票亦然。</p>
<p>㈤吾人於第㈡㈢兩段中’對股票價格舉落作綜合的研究’於第㈣段中復不厭詳煩各别研究諸企業之實情與其給予股票價格之影響’對於美國股票價格慘落’已瞭然於胸矣。故吾人結論曰：股票價格之慘落’非咎在股票自身’而整個國民經濟實應負其責。溯自一九三三年證券法實施以還’股票價格已有不少起色’第㈡段已有言之。惟一九三四年之證劵投機取締或交易所管理法案則頗有操之過急之弊’與實情上學理上俱有不合’吾前已言之。據最近電傅’此法案巳有不少修改’今後或亦能如一九三三年法案之奏效’亦未可知。吾人再度言曰：股票市塲之復興’以產業復興爲前提’統制證券政策’實爲不得己之舉耳。</p>

<p>收益增進之原因</p>
<p>一九三三年美國製造工廠收益率增進的最大原因’爲物價之漸趨上漲。據美國勞工局發表’一九三三年年終七百八十四種商品原料’半製品和製成品的指數’較年初漲起百分之十四。又據摩迪氏Ｍ00ｄｙ發表：十五種原物料價格指數’漲起百分之五十七。因爲物價趨漲’刺激貨銷’故收益增高’且存貨作價’亦不必過於估低’這種情形’當然有利於工商業。有幾家廠商’在匯價跌落和國外存貨及投資的漲價方面’也占了不少的便宜；因爲如把購存在國外的商品和國外投資的價値’照减値後的美元折算’當然溢出原價不少了。</p>
<p>還有廠商把固定資產及舊式或廢置的設備之帳面價値’分别削减攤除’將股本或公積’比例冲减，則折舊費和其他簡接費’可節省不少’營業額旣經縮减’那末所獲餘利’當然相對的顯示更大了。試觀上表’一九三二年一月至一九三三年一月的中間’因爲各廠把虧損和資本冲銷的結果’凈値總數减少約一、一○○、○○○、○○○美金、截至最近’有許多工廠的凈値’僅當一九二九年的一半弱。餘利的計益’旣然依據資本額’所以資本額减少’足以顯示餘利的相對增高’這一點’我們必須計及的。至如各廠竭力節减成本’緊縮開支’增進效能’改良機械’推廣新出品市塲等’當然也有’助於餘利的增加。</p>
<p>收益增進之阻力</p>
<p>美國自從實施藍鷹運動後’工時縮短’工資增高’原料漲價’工廠成本’較前爲重；故雖上述數種優點’餘利仍不能充分增加。普通工廠的收益率’原巳很低’成本增高’自屬難於維持’不得不以之轉嫁於消費者。如果售價增高過速’或其程度超越購買力的增進’那麽便有　　的會　　了。</p>
<p>物價　　　　’　　存貨　增’　　計一百家廠商的存貨’一九三三年較前年增加百分之二十八’究其資金之來源’大都來自出賣政府債劵及其　票　。</p>
<p>上述二因’尙屬次要’其發關黨要者’則爲中央各洲及地方政府捐稅之　　’廠商對此’痛不疾首。此種情狀’和我國商人之困於苛捐雜稅者’正復相問’其實政府支出之增加’在事前也當充分考量’如果眞恢復與經濟的宏顯’則對於工商業應竭盡保育之能事：否則浮支濫用’一切實成民衆舊擔’則復興之效未見’’而竭　而魚’社會經濟先爲摧殘無遺了。</p>

<h3>華北問題的淸算</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>華北局勢又突臻嚴重了。幾天來，中日間空氣，已陷於極度緊張的狀態中。依据各方的情形觀察，日本或將再演一次肆擾華北的暴舉。今後倘我國不善應付，則結果必至重墮奸人之計。</p>
<p>自塘沽恊定吿成後、華北局面，雖暫呈苟安之象，實際却已埋伏了許多複雜糾葛的禍根。接收戰區的交涉，多倫的被佔，僞軍的擾亂，卽是這禍根的暴露。且日本之圖謀侵略我國，本抱有一貫計劃，似有非達其最終目的不止之槪。故戰事結束後，他們對於政治軍事，仍然積極進行。在政治方观，他們不時向我國提出種種無理的要求。在軍事方面，他們繼續增厚兵力。最近且派遣大批軍官分赴各地視察，測探長城各關隘要塞，加緊軍事布置。揣其活動用意，卽尚未有併吞華北的野心，亦必須脅迫我國承認僞組織無疑。</p>
<p>到底日本此刻有沒有胆量驅兵直壓平津，向國際間再投一顆炸彈，這要看將來事態的發展如何以爲斷。但目前的日本，在國際間，已陷入異常窘迫的境地。日蘇關係，日趨惡化，戰機一觸卽發。對英旣難促英日同盟有復活的希望，對美亦尚未有切實的親善提携的保障。就現勢而論，世界各國所取的態度，於日本未必眞實有利。日本爲欲打開此難關，以爲非威挾中國承認僞組織，簡直無法自拔。故他們現下似乎在努力於達到這一點。蓋中日問題一解决，日本可獲得下列幾項利益。（一）中國旣自己首先承認僞國，世界各國亦必從而承認之。（二）僞滿經濟得向華北發展。（三）日本可集中全力對付俄國。（四）下届海軍會議，不致有滿洲問題的爭辯。（五）日本在國際上可加强一分力量。（六）整個的中國，已來必處於日本的控制下。</p>
<p>如何使中國承認「滿洲國，」是現在日本急待設想的一問題。他們曉得在目下的情勢下，要我國政府直接承認僞滿，時機尚早。可是不呌中國承認，他們自身又沒有出路。於是狡詐的日本，便提出了個淸算華北問題的辦法來。他們以爲華北問題一解决，一切難關就可打開了。他們淸算華北的第一步，便是促我國進行通車通郵以及設關諸事件的談判。</p>
<p>關於通車通郵和設關等問題的談判，前曾喧鬧過一時。迨至最近，這些問題才由醖釀而擴展起來。此項談判，雖我當局始終加以堅决的否認，但綜觀各方所傳消息，日本則必要辦到的，可以斷言。</p>
<p>以我們的觀察，今日華北危機之所以急轉直下，究其原因，無非是日本要藉此脅迫我當局作城下之盟，使中國不能不與僞國通車通郵及互設關卡，成爲實際上的變相承認。爲今之計，我當局應立卽嚴詞拒絕。萬一我國屈於威力，不得已而容忍之。這於日本當然心滿意足，於我國則不啻是一致命傷。東省失地永無收回的希望不必說，國際間的同情，亦將被我們毁棄無餘。未來的禍患，正不堪設想呢！</p>
<p>然而華北形勢，目前因日本的恫嚇威脅，已吿急迫萬分，果我國對於日方的要求，斷然堅拒，則今後華北局面，必將因日本的加緊肆擾，而越發戰猛。這又當怎樣處置呢？這實有待於我國人民的覺醒，而下最大的决心了。否則豈但華北問題無從解决，卽整個的中國，亦將陷入絕望的危境！</p>

<h3>再談革烟</h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>抽烟習慣的養成，我已記不起是那一年的事了，因爲在我讀書的學校裏，抽烟是並不禁止的，感情較重的師生時常在臥室中抽烟談天，在這種環境之中，我由嘗試而竟吿在懵。不過這時候的抽烟好像含一點時髦性質，遇到一個朋友抽一枝烟敬客，自己也含上一枝，然後談話，遊玩，都覺得打足氣了，其實我認爲抽紙烟不致於上癮而欲罷不能。　　在某一種人抽烟往往抽定一個牌子。抽茄立克的當然是虚榮，抽大英牌的那是老槍，然而有一般專抽美麗牌，白金龍，而就堅决不抽旁的烟，我覺得太沒有理由了。什麽烟都抽，祇要不刺喉嚨。有錢的時候抽白錫包，癟的時候金字塔照樣一天的一盒。</p>
<p>說到革烟，我想每一個抽烟的人者嘗一次或多次的立過願，結果還是再抽。這樣說來，紙烟似乎也有癮的；而且給抽大烟的藉口，區區紙烟都不能戒革，抽上大烟是無論如何沒有辦法的了。　　據我的經騐，革烟最好在生病之後。一個人生了病，往往抽烟的時候覺到一種難聞的奇臭，所以我一生病，就不抽烟，有時可以在抽烟的時候發覺臭味而斷定我將要生病。我利用這種機會來革烟次數太多了，可惜都是沒有决心，走過烟紙店或者瞧見旁人抽烟，就躍躍欲試了。</p>
<h3>大學選舉</h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>「不行，我們太吃虧了；假如他們只給我們兩票，我們决不出席，看他們的委員怎樣產生。」</p>
<p>「對的，我們不出席投票，這是最有效的抵制辦法。」</p>
<p>「就是這個會流產了，我們也得堅持到底！」</p>
<p>「小王野心太大，他想包辦學生會，眞是混帳！在球塲上他儘管出風頭，要來壓制我們，可别想！我們偏不輸這口氣。」</p>
<p>「到那天，要是情形不對，打得他個頭破血流再說，看他們運動員究竟是怎樣的威風！咱最是個坍下天都是不怕的！」</p>
<p>「不管三七二十一，七個委員，咱們至少總得當選四個；要知道，咱們已經讓出了三個位置，這是無可再讓的了！」</p>
<p>「就是拿咱們的歷史地位和關係來說，那班小鬼也不應該來和咱們爭委員，眞是豈有此理，瞎了他們的狗眼睛」。</p>
<p>「不過，他們旣然凖備出頭和咱們爭奪，大槪他們是有誰做背景，至少也必是受了誰的慫恿，俗語說··，來者不善，咱們應當商量個具體而有效的對策才行，不然，咱們儘管小看他，或是不提早凖備，等上了他們的當可來不及了！」</p>
<p>「老李的話是老成有經騐的，咱們亟應商籌對策。依我的意思，咱們馬上聯名並徵求附和，咱們的同學致函訓育處，說他們受了某某的指使，想來把持學生會，藉以作宜傳ＸＸ的活動··訓育處得了這個報吿，必定要給他一個有力的警吿，那時，我們再向爲他們掏旗呐喊的新同學們宣傳一下，說是學校當局，和地方上警務當局都注意他們了，呌他們當心自己無辜受累，他們受了這打擊，看他們還有什麽勁兒？」</p>
<p>「不贊成，不贊成！咱們偏要硬幹一下！老潘的妙計固妙，但究竟不是好漢幹的，而且圈子兜得太大，人扯得太多，時間也不經濟，太費事了，再者，訓育處受不受我們的利用，也是沒有把握，假使事不成而給他們知道了，倒給他們一個反宣傳的把柄，那我們就吃虧不少小了！老潘你說是不是呢？所以，這是行不通的，我想張天一的話是可以做的，但我們應先一方面給他們一個警吿，一方面派人去疏通一下，他們不聽，到那夫就打得他個頭破血流，豈不痛快？放心好了，委員總是我們做的。」</p>
<p>三層樓一間朝南的宿舍裏，兩張床舖上坐着也有躺着的七八個年靑的。小帽拖鞋，西裝而沒有打領結的大學生，他們紛紛地談論着關於下星期學生會選舉的事情，有的憤慨地在跳噪着，有的在默想着有效的對策，有的右手揑了拳頭向左手掌心裏拚命的擊着，並且做出打的姿勢，然而有的口裏嘘着小調，鎭靜得像沒事兒的—總之，他們你一句，我一嘴地雜亂的呌喊着，於是這間小房子便的確浸沉在熱鬧的空氣裏了。</p>
<p>大選的日期終於到臨了；張天一對他們的敵人的警吿，竟得到了意外的强硬的答覆，已成了公開的事實，一班悠哉遊哉小開式的同學們都在喜笑顏開地等候着看熱鬧，膽小些的，已駭得請病假回家逃避去了，深怕這禍事會跑到自己頭上來樣的；校長室裏大槪也知道了這件事的嚴重性、然而只出了一張，不大疼癢的呌學生要維護法治精神的佈吿。—後來聽說校長因怕禍路到自己的身上，所以在開會前五分鐘廻避在校外了。</p>
<p>選舉在嘻笑呌駡的聲中完成了；開票的結果，張天一方面竟獲到意外的空前的慘敗。但當小王這一派人正在呼喊勝利口號和歌唱的時候，墨盒子，磚片，石子以及紙團等等一齊飛向臺上，接着雄壯而夾着凈銳的呼打的聲音嚷成了一片，而新委員小王們就在亂軍中遛走了。</p>
<p>當張天一這班人追出禮堂以後，看熱鬧的人也就散了。大禮堂裏只遺留着翻臥着的椅凳，和滿飛在地上的紅綠色的選舉票子。</p>
<h3>流浪兒傳（廿六）</h3>
<p>— 陳靜生製</p>
<p>衝鋒！這種仇，是刻骨的仇，槍刀不會加上頸的人才會忘記這種仇！</p>
<h3>「玩玩而已」</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>三十歲少婦姚麗芬，以被六十七歲老翁龐春山所遺棄，提起同居贍養訴訟於法庭。被吿律師爲被吿聲辯，謂被吿當年結識原吿，原屬玩玩而已，絕無夫婦關係。原吿律師抗稱，被吿旣以玩物視原吿，足見今之抛棄，則係玩厭了，這種行爲，實屬輕視女性云</p>
<p>「玩玩而已，」現在社會上的確有不少男子對女子是抱着這一種態度。女子的運命委實不幸，在封建時代，她們是附屬於男子，處男子奴隸的地位；降至今日資本主義時代，女子的地位，又由奴隸而變爲商品。資本主義社會最重視的是金錢，有了金錢，便什麽都能從心所欲。而商品的代價是金錢，可以用金錢去交換；女子旣變成了商品，則只要有金錢，也就可以買得到。用金錢交換來的商品，是買者的所有物；用壞了，要丢掉，或換新的，盡聽物主的方便。用金錢得來的女子，是主人的所有者；玩厭了，要抛棄，或另取一個當意的，主人自然也有權支配。在這種情形之下，女子便變成了男子的玩物了。</p>
<p>然而這不僅是男子的罪惡，女子也要分負一部分責任。現社會上，不是有不少女子，凖備着要給男子玩玩的嗎？將赤裸的肉體，呈獻給洩慾者去蹂躪的娼妓，明顯地是要給人玩玩的；但我們不忍去責怪她們，因爲她們之所以不惜犧牲色相，以營此皮肉生涯，是受殘酷生活所驅迫，並非自己的願望。我們所要痛駡的，是那班富於虚榮心的女子。目今一般虚榮女子，她們往往受不起物質生活的誘惑，情願將自己的整個身體，供男子任意玩弄，以遂其物質享樂的欲望。這種女子，大都是拜金主義者；她們只要男子有錢供她們揮霍，只要男子能够滿足她們的所有虚榮心，則無是零賣整售，她們都願意。她們簡直以肉體和金錢作交易。她們時時打扮得非常妖冶，在等候着人家去玩玩。不要說是男子去勾引她們，他們有時還要來蠱惑男子呢。</p>
<p>就拿姚龐的事來說，龐春山已是個有妻有子的老年人了；他當時看中姚麗芬，欲納爲小星，無疑地是抱着「玩玩而已」的野心；及今相處已至十年之久、竟一旦棄之如敝屣，更顯然的是玩厭了的結果。這種行爲，說他是侮辱女性，並不過分。至若姚麗芬，她當日還是個妙齡十九的少女，而龐春山已是個五十多歲的老翁；她之自願委身相事，實行同居，說她沒有爲任何虚榮心所誘動，那眞不能呌我們輕信。因爲我們敢斷定，假使龐某不是個有錢人，姚女士是决不肯和他結合的。</p>
<p>撇開個人的問題不說；從另一觀點看，男子之視女子爲玩物，自有其社會的原因存在着。蓋現社會是個男權時代的社會，社會上的一切特權，盡操在男子的手掌中；女子的地位，旣低於男子，女子的生活，又須仰賴男子的給養；於是女子就不免要變成男子的玩物了。故女子若不想爭回自己的地位和人格則已；若想爭回自己的地位和人格，那末唯一的出路，非把男權社會打倒，創造一男女平權的社會不可了！</p>
<h3>夜歸</h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>辭别主人，脫離了快樂的家庭，已在午夜了。街上燈光昏黯，又似乎迷霧似的目光捉不到較遠處的人物。高聲地喚了兩聲黃包車，彷彿在山谷中傳來了自己的回響，這回音分外的淸脆，故意再提高了嗓子呼喚，自已笑了。</p>
<p>我喜歡在細雨迷濛的時候，獨自兒在幽靜的馬路上散步，念着戴舒堂的雨巷「撑着油紙傘，獨自彷徨在悠長，悠長又寂寥的雨巷，我希望逢着一個—丁香一樣地結着愁怨的姑娘。她靜默地走近，走近，又投出太自一般的眼光。她飄過像夢一般地；像夢一般地凄婉迷茫。」自然你不必逢着那樣一個丁香的姑娘，念着那首詩時，似乎已在你面飄前過了結着愁怨的輪廓。</p>
<p>於是聽着自己沉重的脚步聲在迷霧中向家的路上走去。屋子裏的音樂，歌聲，彷彿和我步伐合着節凑，我故意繞了遠道寳貴靑春將逝去似的小心的走。　　燈光愈迷糊了，週遭是死一般的寂寞，心跳着，皮鞋聲躅着，我演不出我的心境是悲，是喜？刹那間的歡樂，或者是換來了更凄凉的回憶？</p>
<p>終於到了家，迷霧隔離在燈光外面，現實是一杯苦的醒茶，仰起𩓐子，喝一個盡罷！</p>

<h3>桃花的憑弔</h3>
<p>— 薔薇</p>
<p>早晨，　　從夢境裏惓遊歸來，跳進了自己的軀體裏，於是我醒了，打一個呵欠，伸一回懶腰。看錶，長針指在六字上，短針指在七字和八字的中間，意思就是說，我應該起身了；於是爬起床，怱怱地穿上衣服，梳洗，進早點。一切都已舒齊，就跨上馬路，電車把我帶到辦公室裏。</p>
<p>在電車裏，靈魂還在我軀體裏打磕睡；跳下車，走進了辦公室，裏面的空氣似乎和外面的有些不同，嚴酷得使人發顫。於是靈魂在我的軀體裏，翻了一個筋斗，坐正了位置，幹這一天的工作。直到天色已經昏暗，疲憊的軀體背着自己的靈魂走出了辦公室；回到家裏。因爲一天的操勞，一切都已失掉了興趣，於是靈魂又在軀體裏打着磕睡，直到軀體一倒上床上，不待胡蝶姑娘唱出催眠曲，靈魂兒早已溜進了夢境裏。</p>
<p>每天如此，每月如此，每年如此，我就是如此地在生活着。</p>
<p>可是，生活，這個名字似乎已經不很確切，在我的軀體裏，旣經失却了生趣，在我的靈魂裏，又已沒有了活力，我已不自知還有我自己的存在，我祇知道我得爲我的一家，維持我自己的存在，替别人做一些工作，從别人的口袋裏換取一些錢來，維持我一家的存在，每天如此地，像機械樣地，我已不自知有我自已的存在了。</p>
<p>我不但不自知有我自己的存在，並且我也已不知道還有環境的存在。走上文明結晶的都市的馬路，奪目動心的商品在橱窗裏招着手，可是空了的錢囊，使我不敢發生什麽慾望，連顧盼一下的勇氣都已完全消失。有時，天暖了，可是我祗有着一襲厚厚的棉花，於是我也祇得依舊把牠背在身上；有時，天寒了，可是我祗有一件薄薄的單衫，於是我也祗有勉强把牠包裏住我顫觫的軀體。環境使我不敢知道還有環境的存在。</p>
<p>我也部想到我應該離開了這生活高昂的都市，回到生活程度較低的鄕村去，可是我在都市裏還有一個能够勉强維持一家生活的職業，如果回到鄕村去，不一定就能謀到一個足以維持一家温飽的職業，那裏生活程度雖低，終也沒有什麽好處，於是我還祗有戰戰兢兢地捧住這個飯碗，惟恐不保。</p>
<p>一天天地，一年年地，我就自此地在生活着。</p>
<p>淸明那天，韻從龍華帶回幾枝桃花，疏疏的幾枝，插進了瓶裏，點綴着這雜亂的小室。</p>
<p>植物得到了水和陽光的營養，終會習慣地發育着。這幾枝桃花，養在花瓶裏，竟也開足了花蕾，並且花辨跌落後，椏枝上還發出了葉的綠芽。但一眼望去，這枝小生物，在這雜亂的小室裏，就像是格外悴憔，沒有生氣似的。因爲不自然的生長，終於造成了不自然的氣象！</p>
<p>然而這樣的不自然的生長，終於也不能維持得很久，韻兩天忘了給牠換上新鮮的水，枝上的綠芽，就全枯樵了。啊，可憐的桃花，在這不自然的生長中掙扎着，終於也天折了！這不禁使我感槪地想到自己，我何嘗不像這幾枝桃花。我的生活，全賴着我的環境，謀着一種不自然的生活，正像這幾枝桃花，被折下了插在花瓶裏，不得自然　生長，全懶着人們的照顧，可是一旦失了照顧，於是就祗有流入夭折之途了。</p>
<p>可是在這都市裏像我這樣生活着的人們，不知有多少，然而能有幾人曾想到了他自己的命運，正像這幾枝被折下了插在瓶裏的桃花。</p>
<h3>春昏</h3>
<p>— 子騰</p>
<p>一個幽靜春天的黃昏，我在離Ｘ村五里許的田野裏，漫無目的地踱著。斜陽由遠處照射着他的艶麗的晚霞，倒映在那面前的　　淸溪，把溪水照得燦爛如錦，　人心絃的晚風，　　　　的埀柳，不時發出一種幽美微微的細嚮，及偶爾由鄕村裏傳來了幾聲犬吠聲，好像在歡迎這個美麗的春昏。</p>
<p>我獨自在欣賞這個含有詩意和畫意的春昏的當兒，忽然我的耳鼓聽到一種很微細很悲凉的哭泣聲，打動了我的寂寞的心絃，我被好奇心的驅使，脚步不由自主地跟着哭聲的嚮處踱去，踱過了面前的淸溪，一角被樹枝遮蓋着的紅樓，突然映入我的眼簾裏，同時嚶嚶的啜泣聲比先時所聽着的驟然大聲了許多，我便把步履放輕着望前踱去，在紅樓緊貼溪邊的欄杆，我發現有一位年届二八的女郎，臨風玉立，她的圓圓面龐，像黃紙般似的，蓬亂的長髮，披了她兩肩，滿面掛着晶瑩的涙珠，形容憔悴得十二分可憐。</p>
<p>「我今世沒有希望了，唉！…想不到你這樣忍心啊！舊日你不是說我是你的最親愛的一個嗎？認我是你的終身伴侣嗎？唉！男人心，海底針，唉！……」她用着寒蛩似的音調說着，她的聲音漸漸地顫動起來，後面她說些什麽，我完全沒有聽淸楚。</p>
<p>忽然一陣撕紙聲音在上面嚮着，接着一片片像秋風落葉似的落在我的身邊，拾起來一看，原來是一張張破碎的情書，字跡已經辦認不淸了，－因爲四面都被黑暗籠罩着，我不敢再留戀，急急地離開了紅樓，我的腦海裏印着一個失戀女郎的輪廓。（却酬）</p>
<h3>誰從我超脫</h3>
<p>— 古人</p>
<p>人們一到成年，便無時不在「追求」「應付」「改造」三個環境中掙扎着。</p>
<p>「追求」是應人生及時的需要，「應付」是解决隨時產生的一切事體，「改造」是爲要洗換不利的而趨向新善的，目的是爲要「幸福」。</p>
<p>個人謀個人的幸福很容易，祇要把對一切障碍··弱者擊之，强者媚之，與我平力者迎之合之，個人「幸福」無不成功者。</p>
<p>然而人之所以不如是行的原因有二··一是智慧的；是爲「道德」觀念與「人道」主義而不忍爲。一是無知的··當然是不會知道這種謀個人幸福的藝術。</p>
<p>可是人之能善用之者；也不出這兩種人啊！</p>
<p>至於似知不知，不上不下的這類人，就是造成萬惡社會的劣根。（這裏申明··小子也屬這類）</p>
<p>誠然，所謂正人君子者；是决對立不住足在這社會裏的。然而縱使你眞是正人君子，也决對沒人相信你的，原因</p>
<p>是社會如斯也。</p>
<p>「追求」是人的天性，不追不求，决無戰爭，旣經戰爭，自然趨於應付。應付得手，當然幸福自生，——所以有句話··「藝術是吃飽飯沒有事做才產生的」。就是這個原理。</p>
<p>讀者别疑我是哲學信徒，因爲「現代文學」都流入似「哲學」類「科學」的兩不相中間。其次有許多先生們不時把「哲學」招到嘴上說，我敢武斷；假使你問他哲學是什麽？我相信他也答解不出來。</p>
<p>講什麽半元一元，哲學的重要頭領自行投降「科學」是眞的，這裏我再武斷一句「哲學的基礎」根本就是建築在河漢上，</p>
<p>至於談「超脫」，根本就不懂得什麽！十九世紀中葉以前談超脫是情有原，二十世紀要超脫寻是「盲從」，不然是無知，也許是翻花的「復古」。</p>
<p>可憐我們的一切，……似乎者還在「哲學」中混戰着。</p>
<p>不差，這世界上僅容納得住如我們這樣不上不下的卡中人啊！</p>
<p>我說··與其說是「哲學」不如說是「藝術」來得好聽悅目些，光明磊落些。　　究竟超脫到那兒去？大慨智慧的人才懂超脫，跳黃浦江是超脫，出洋遊名勝也是超脫。</p>
<p>苦啦！我們這些呆子，超脫不能，伸肩負擔，負擔不可，坐待超脫，此自然之超脫也。</p>
<p>話說回來，世界上無不想超脫的人，無不反對超脫的人，所以永遠沉淪於矛盾之中。</p>

<h3>骨肉之間（九）</h3>
<p>— 曼之</p>
<p>桂孫說，一蓮孫哥你還不算發財嗎？進了一批日本布，就賺幾千塊，天天請客化兩塊錢算什麽？」</p>
<p>蓮孫說，「你知其一不知其二，賣日本布賺錢是有的，但是得和那些人應酬，賺一千他們就拿去了五百，其實也賺不多，算什麽發財？」</p>
<p>桂孫不相信，兩人又爭論起來。鑑光覺得無聊，在打呵欠，望着天井裏頭在下着的雨發悶。不一回，普寗將酒菜提進來了。三人圍了桌子吃起酒來了。一面吃酒一面談話，蓮孫試探鑑光說，</p>
<p>「這回要到那裏去了呢？」</p>
<p>「到香港。去上海也不一定。但是，我想，路費沒有，恐怕走不成！」鑑光說着從腰裏拿出兩枝手槍來，蓮孫和桂孫嚇了一跳，只見他又說，「這兩只狗子，是頂好的左輪，一枝配有百粒子彈，不知道賣到一百六十塊錢沒有？」</p>
<p>蓮孫以爲他要敲竹槓，心頭在跳動，聽到這裏，原來是要賣，才放了心，忙答說，「有的，有的。」鑑光又說，</p>
<p>「如果蓮孫哥你要，就賣給你。我得了這一律錢也可以走路。」　　蓮孫心裏想着他六叔的計劃，得了這兩枝左輪，明天還把錢嗎？正要應諾，只見桂孫搶着說，「賣給我，我在鄕裏有用。」蓮孫有點生氣的說，「難道我就沒有用嗎？先說的先得。」鑑光恐怕他們爭執，忙調解地說，「不用爭，人一枝好了。八十塊錢明天就得銀貨兩交。一他們兩人見獨佔不得也就滿口應承了。蓮孫再敬酒，鑑光自信酒量很大，一杯子一杯子的喝乾，回敬了他們兩個，他們也喝乾了。接着就猜直起拳來。</p>
<p>蓮孫看鑑光已經有了點醉意，便下了毒手，將麻醉藥放進酒壺裏頭去，鑑光喝乾一杯子又一杯子，不一回便支持不住，倒下椅子去了！桂孫還假意地推他起來喝酒。見不醒了，蓮孫忙呌普寗去請六爺來。普寗剛走，兩人爭着搶他的手槍和子彈。</p>
<p>陰黑的天空，雨在下着風在颼颼地呌着，房裏的燈光半明半滅的在搖幌着。六爺拉着太太到了新房子，一眼看見鑑光醉倒在椅子上，喝聲，「來！」將手裏的布條子打了一個結兒套進他的頸裏，自己拿了一端，一端拿給太太，太太雖然接着，想起昨天夜裏的夢，心頭在跳動，手和脚在抖戰，完全沒有一點力量，而且暈倒下去，六爺對太太生氣了。</p>

<h3>Chiang Sends Telegram to Chen Inquiring About Southwest Rumors, Chen Replies They Can Be Dismissed with a Laugh</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Yangjing telegraphed that Xie Zheng's 8th Division Training Corps and Lian Tisheng's regiment attacked Junmenling at 5 a.m. on the 21st. By 6 p.m. that afternoon, they had occupied Junmenling, with Lian's regiment taking the lead. Hundreds of bandits were killed and hundreds of rifles were seized. (22nd Special Dispatch) (Hong Kong) Li Zongren arrived in the province on the morning of the 22nd to confer with Chen Jitang, planning to return to Guangxi in a few days. Chen Langtang's brother, Wei Zhou, arrived in Hepu to persuade Xiang Hanping and Zhang Meixin to return to the province. Xiang and Zhang have already agreed in person. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain source, after Chairman Chiang returned to Nanchang from resolving the Fujian situation, he concentrated his forces to suppress the communist bandits. Yesterday, he sent a telegram to Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army, outlining the bandit suppression plan. He also described the recent bandit suppression efforts of the Central and Northern Route armies. Chiang Dingwen, the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route army, is also advancing towards Changting, hoping that the Southern Route army will launch a general offensive on Junmen, Huichang, and all other areas to divide the bandit forces and achieve a swift victory. It is also heard that he inquired about the various rumors circulating in the Southwest. It is said that after receiving the telegram, Chen replied to Chairman Chiang the day before yesterday, reporting on the latest military situation in the Southern Route and addressing the rumors mentioned in Chiang's telegram in detail. He stated that all such things are the result of ulterior motives, and that their side treats each other with sincerity, and no rumors can drive a wedge between them. He hopes that the Chairman will dismiss them with a laugh. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liu Bandit Situation Largely Resolved, Liu Himself Escapes to Tianjin by Civilian Boat, Remnants Led by Liu Huaizhi</h3>
<p>(Jinan) At 5 p.m. yesterday, the Zhan Shutang division fiercely attacked Liu bandits at Shizi River, more than 20 li southeast of Wangquan Cliff in Linyi, killing approximately 200 bandits, capturing 40 to 50 alive, seizing 40 to 50 rifles, and over 400 mules, horses, and donkeys. The remaining 60 to 70 bandits fled to Chunguan Village southeast of Linyi for a meeting, deciding to go to Donghai County and disband. This morning, each company of the Zhan division selected 60 brave soldiers to pursue them. At 7 a.m., Tang Bangzhi's brigade pursued them to Chunguan Village, killing over 20 bandits, seizing over 20 rifles, over 20 horses, and capturing over 20 alive. This afternoon, the remaining thousands of bandits fled to Lianzipo, southeast of Juxian County, and Ganlin, south of Lianzipo. At 4 p.m., they fled to Tangjialouzi, southwest of Rizhao and bordering Ganyu, still showing a tendency to flee eastward. The Liu bandit situation has thus been completely resolved. Captured bandits confessed that Liu himself, along with a fake regiment commander, fled to Tianjin by civilian boat from Qingkou Town at 5 a.m. yesterday morning.

<h3>The Representative of the Tanggu Truce Did Not Make Any Verbal Agreements, According to a Certain Gentleman Who Participated in the Matter, Representatives Should Be Punished If They Make Verbal Agreements</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) When Japanese Ambassador Arata Yoshii came to Nanjing last time to say goodbye, he instructed Representative Ariyoshi to speak to the press, saying that the representatives of both sides had made verbal agreements regarding traffic and postal services during the Tanggu Truce. According to a certain gentleman who participated in the matter, 1) Upon investigation, there were no other agreements besides the five announced articles of the Tanggu Truce. At that time, the discussion was based on the agreement to recover the railway from Yuguan to Tangshan, not the current issue of traffic. 2) The representative of the Tanggu Truce repeatedly declared that it did not involve politics and was limited to military affairs. If there were verbal agreements on traffic and postal services, it would exceed the scope of authority, and the Chinese government should take appropriate disciplinary action. 3) According to the Tanggu Truce, the Japanese transport teams should automatically withdraw to the line of the Great Wall. Japan has not yet fulfilled this, and instead accuses China of a verbal agreement, which is difficult to explain. Moreover, this so-called verbal agreement is completely non-existent.

<h3>International Policies Towards Japan and Our Country</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>The recent informal statement issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preposterous and has been severely criticized by international public opinion. Foreign Minister Hirota, aware of the agitated atmosphere abroad, quickly changed his tune, saying that Japan had no intention of violating the Open Door Policy and the principle of equal opportunity, and had no intention of infringing upon existing treaties. Sima Zhao's heart is known to all. Empty words are used to perfunctorily cover up the truth. Even if the Japanese are clever, how can they cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand?</p>
<p>Today's dangerous international situation is compared to the eve of the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. This is not an exaggeration. The Disarmament Conference is on the verge of collapse, France, Germany, and Italy are vying for supremacy, the two great Anglo-Saxon nations are dreaming different dreams, the Fascist and Communist parties are drawing their swords, the whirlpool of the Danube, and the gloom of the Balkans are all well known. This need not be repeated. This time, Japan dared to repeat its old trick of presenting the Twenty-One Demands, using threatening words to try to turn our country into its protectorate in one fell swoop. This is not unrelated to the international situation. However, this does not mean that the international community will allow Japan to run rampant and dare not make a final decision to restrain it. Great Britain, the United States, and Russia all have close ties with the Far East. After the September 18th Incident, Japanese troops swept through our four northeastern provinces. Although these countries did not take active measures to restrain them, they were so anxious to reorganize their military preparations, in fact, because they felt threatened by Japan. This is undeniable. According to the initial intentions of various countries, after Japan acquired Manchuria, it should know when to stop. Therefore, they also temporarily adopted a monitoring attitude and did not go too far. Since the recent Japanese statement was issued, the international situation has suddenly changed. Judging from the remarks of major newspapers in various countries, their enthusiasm and agitation are actually greater than when the September 18th Incident first broke out. British and American democratic countries have always determined the adoption or rejection of policies based on the support of public opinion. Newspaper remarks are a measure of public opinion. The New York Times in the United States, and the London Times and Manchester Guardian in the United Kingdom are all loved by the majority of their citizens and are known for being conservative and prudent. Now, they all criticize Japan's position with harsh words. The power of public opinion that is thus mobilized must be valued by their governments. British figures such as Viscount Cecil and labor party cadres, and American figures such as Senators Borah and Johnson, have all made solemn statements. Will the British and American governments ultimately maintain their silent attitude, invisibly encouraging the arrogant atmosphere of the Japanese? According to our observations, I am afraid it will not come to this. Let us wait and see what happens next. Since publishing Japan's "declaration" document last October, Russia has been more and more openly preparing for war against Japan. Yesterday, its chairman, Kalinin, issued a warning, advocating active war preparations, with women and children all becoming soldiers. This is also not unrelated to Japan's recent statement. Speaking again of the League of Nations' past attitude, although it seemed weak, in fact, it was because the positions of its important member states were not consistent, so it could not be. Now that Japan has directly provoked the League of Nations, and the League's main member states, such as Great Britain, France, and Italy, have all begun to feel that it was a mistake to condone Japan in the past. The future League of Nations will not repeat the mistakes of the past. Moreover, the Soviet Union has expressed its intention to join the League of Nations in order to consolidate its anti-Japanese front, which can be mutually relied upon and increase momentum. From this point of view, if Japan insists on using force to implement its plan to blockade China, I am afraid it will not be easy. Although we cannot say that Japan's threats are entirely empty words, we deeply feel that it is unlikely that the warlords of that country, no matter how reckless they may be, would make an enemy of the world with the small power of one country. So what is Japan's true intention this time?</p>
<p>We believe that Japan's publication of the informal statement was by no means accidental. On the contrary, it is a manifestation of its consistent policy. The so-called consistent policy is to create its own Monroe Doctrine in East Asia, and ultimately turn the Chinese coast, and even the Pacific Ocean, into Japan's lakes. The creation of a political doctrine is not the work of a day or night and cannot be accomplished overnight. It must first be constantly repeated in the ears of the world through self-proclaimed propositions, and gradually accumulate through indirect attacks until the conditions are ripe and its long-cherished wish is fulfilled. Considering the completion of the American Monroe Doctrine, it was initially regarded as a one-sided proposition. Later, it was repeatedly explained and supplemented to invisibly become an internationally recognized principle. Japan's desire to promote the East Asian Monroe Doctrine has not been achieved overnight. The intention is also the same. Demands such as the Twenty-One Demands in the past, the conclusion of the Lansing-Ishii Agreement, opposition to bank consortia investing in China, and opposition to the League of Nations providing technical cooperation to China are all concrete manifestations of this. Now that its position in Manchuria has become stable, and the Soviet Union's attitude is very worrying, it is willing to take advantage of the busy international situation to restate its consistent position. If we want to oppose a political doctrine now, we should adhere to it consistently and observe it meticulously. Otherwise, it will only serve as a short-term public relations exercise, leaving the impression of this doctrine in everyone's mind. If so, the Japanese will be secretly happy and will not stop there.</p>
<p>There are four directions that we can follow in the future. First, we should adhere to our consistent policy of being neither arrogant nor humble. Sino-Japanese diplomacy, whether major or minor, should be fully shouldered by the central authorities and dealt with by the central authorities of the other party. Second, we should immediately carry out a total diplomatic mobilization. All diplomatic and consular personnel stationed abroad should repeatedly explain the meaning of Japan's statement to the government and the public of their respective countries to awaken and expand the public opinion of those countries. Third, we should strengthen internal unity and coordinate external steps. Fourth, we should actively engage in construction projects, advance according to established plans, and not be discouraged by threats.</p>
<p>We do not want to be complacent about the slightly improved international situation, but after this setback, the stagnant diplomatic situation has been broken and those who are fascinated by the theory of compromise with Japan have had the opportunity to awaken, which is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<h3>The Second Batch of American Flour to be Transported to the Northwest for Relief After Discussion by the Committee</h3>

<h3>Our Embassy in France Issues Declaration on Japan, Peace in the Far East Will Ultimately Be Difficult to Achieve Unless Japan Abandons Its Policy of Aggression</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chinese Embassy here protested against Japan's external development policy in the name of the Chinese government, stating briefly that the Chinese government had instructed the Chinese Minister to Tokyo to request the Japanese government to explain its recent declaration. The final paragraph of the declaration stated that the most reliable guarantee of peace in the Far East lies not in the powers abandoning their friendship and beneficial cooperation with China, but in Japan abandoning its imperialist policy towards Asia and strictly respecting its treaty obligations. (21st Havana Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Saito Makes More Sophistry in the US, Suspects International Assistance in Our Construction</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, told a reporter from the Associated Press today that Japan's repeated statement of its policy toward China was the result of the US cotton and wheat loans to China being diverted to political purposes. According to Saito, the Japanese government believes that China's control over the use of these loans is harming peace in Asia. Ambassador Saito also vigorously argued that Japan has no intention of closing the door to China. Japan only hopes that China will no longer rely on distant countries for military assistance, because their interests in the Far East are not as great as Japan's. Japan believes that this military assistance is detrimental to the security of the East. At this point, Saito specifically mentioned the recent situation of China's aviation development and said that this matter has caused panic in Japan, suspecting that it will be enough to confront Japan in the future. In his conclusion, Saito attacked the commercial loans to China, saying that most of them were diverted to military use, which made Japan, as a neighboring country, even more uneasy. This prompted the Japanese government to restate its policy and advise the powers to be cautious in providing assistance to China. (21st National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A French Newspaper's Alarming Views: Is Britain About to Succumb to Japan?</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Times today published an editorial stating that new events are occurring in the Far East. Considering the current international situation, Japan has a good opportunity to achieve victory. Japan seems to be taking advantage of the tensions in Europe and the trends in America to create a de facto protectorate over China, practically overseeing China's relations with other countries, and declaring a Far Eastern Monroe Doctrine. If this point is reached, it will be because the powers are competing with each other in China, with differing interests, and are unable to find remedial measures. Japan believes that its geographical position can be used to take advantage of the situation, and that only its army is capable of taking effective action to curb China's dangerous situation. It is noted that the French authorities have not yet expressed their opinion on Japan's declaration. The newspaper's comments may implicitly indicate the French government's attitude, which can be described as surprisingly moderate. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The Observer's diplomatic correspondent states that London opinion is clearly focused on the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on China on Wednesday. The time when European diplomats will have to re-engage with Japan in the process of solving their own European problems is therefore approaching. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Wang Yitang Arrives in Japan</h3>

<h3>Soviet Chairman Inspects National Defense: Insatiable Ambitions of Eastern Neighbors, Unable to Rest Easy, Defensive Works Have Many Gaps, Consider How to Remedy Them, Advocate Training Women and Children to Serve in the Rear During Wartime</h3>
<p>Active Shipbuilding Plan in Progress</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Chairman Kalinin recently toured the country and returned to Beijing a few days ago. It is said that there are many gaps in Russia's defense works, which urgently need to be remedied. Kalinin advocates training women and children, saying that if men are called to war, all those unable to serve in the military should serve in the rear, or it is thought that a war of aggression against the Soviet Union has not yet been declared, so there is no need for this. Those who think this way are short-sighted. Kalinin also criticized agricultural district leaders for being too negligent in training women and children and men unable to wield weapons to engage in collective field work when strong men are mobilized. After listening to Kalinin's warning, the Soviet leaders are now actively carrying out a huge program of war defense. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>New York News, Rear Admiral Paul Vorolas, naval attaché of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, is only thirty-seven years old and one of the young officers in the Soviet Navy. He speaks seven languages. According to him, the Soviet naval construction plan is progressing step by step, and a strong defense project is being built throughout the country. He said, "Now that dark clouds are looming in Asia, we must prepare to defend ourselves when necessary. But as Stalin said, the Soviet Union never covets the land of other countries, and at the same time will never give up its own land." He also said that the Russian navy had 600,000 to 700,000 tons before the war, and now it is about 400,000 tons, but it is implementing a step-by-step construction plan to gradually expand its strength. He also said that his position is not really a rear admiral. In the Russian Navy, officers do not use job titles, and their rank is counted by numbers, from 1st to 13th. His rank is 11th, which is equivalent to the rank of rear admiral. This name is used for convenience in foreign countries. (World Press)</p>

<h3>Japanese Minister of Army States: No Intention to Use Force Against Russia, Full of Justice and Peace</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, visited Minister of the Army Hayashi at his official residence yesterday afternoon to inquire about Minister Hayashi's views on the issue of national defense and military preparations. Minister Hayashi explained in detail that the Japanese people have no intention of using force at any time. The military preparations necessary for Japan are within the extent that the sense of security of the Japanese Empire is not threatened. The Japanese army will not change due to the change of the Minister of the Army. Regarding the national defense plan, Japan, for the sake of justice, is prepared and determined to rise up and resist no matter what the sacrifice. He also strongly stated that the world's view that General Araki is a warlike general and that he is a non-war advocate is a misunderstanding. General Araki is fundamentally a peace advocate. The meeting lasted for over an hour before the Soviet Ambassador took his leave. (Dentsu, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Yurenev, visited Minister of the Army Hayashi at 2:00 pm on the 21st to ask questions about national defense, military preparations, and other matters. The meeting lasted for one hour before he left. Minister Hayashi explained at that time that the Japanese army would never change its policy. The following is a summary: Changing the Minister of the Army will not cause any changes in the national defense plan, and there is absolutely no possibility of changes. Japan is prepared to spare no sacrifice for the sake of justice, but the Japanese people have always loved peace and never want to recklessly use force. Only by ensuring the security of a country can it rely on the adequacy of military preparations. If this sense of security is not threatened, then its adequate military preparations will be enough to prevent war from breaking out in the future and become a guarantee of peace, not only for Japan, but also for all countries today. All countries are making great efforts to rectify their military preparations, and on the other hand, they are hoping for peace by doing this, because there is no contradiction in fact between loving peace and rectifying military preparations.

<h3>Illegal Road Purchase Negotiations: Russian Puppets Reopen Negotiations Today</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The negotiations for the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway will be reopened on the 23rd after active mediation by Foreign Minister Hirota. It is rumored that the specific plans for the transfer of both parties are quite appropriate in content. If it goes smoothly, there may be a glimmer of hope for a complete solution within May. As for the fishing area bidding issue, if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revises it based on the results of the bidding on February 20, then the negotiation on the revision of the ruble conversion rate can also be agreed to. As for other Japanese-Russian relations, they have all been reorganized since the release of the Chinese Eastern Railway Soviet personnel. The Soviet side is also gradually approaching the Japanese side, and its attitude has also improved since last autumn. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota believes that such a good opportunity should not be missed. After the Chinese Eastern Railway issue is resolved, he should ensure the peace of Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo," recalling the spirit of the Treaty of Portsmouth, and remove all insecure situations on the border. Therefore, it has been decided to establish a tripartite border committee to seek a solution. (Nichi-Ren, 22nd)</p>

These negotiations are expected to be successful quickly. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>American Naval Aircraft Display Power in Panama Sky: Bombing Sounds Shake the Distance, A Startling Scene of War, Hundreds of Warships Arranged in a Long Snake Formation Pass Through the Canal</h3>
<p>Panama Thirty aircraft of the American naval fleet in Balboa, Panama, conducted a simulated attack battle in the sky over the Panama Canal at dawn this morning to test whether the Panama Canal is a weak point in American national defense. During the exercise, the pilots of the attacking team scattered and swept the sky, exposing the fortress of the Panama Canal, which cost the United States $400 million to build. The attacking air force was shrouded in smoke between the blue sky, and the sound of bombing shook the distance. Such a startling scene of war was unprecedented in the canal area. At the end of the simulated battle, all the planes flew back to the aircraft carrier anchored a few miles away. A fleet of 110 ships, sailing directly from California to New York, arrived outside the mouth of the Panama Canal this afternoon. They passed through the canal without surprise. It is also unprecedented. Some of the battleships will stay on the Atlantic coast, so some battleships will pass through the Panama Canal tomorrow. The canal is usually open for 16 hours a day, but it may be open for 24 hours to facilitate the fleet. Usually, up to 26 or 27 ships pass through Panama every day, but this time an average of 40 battleships will pass through from the Pacific to the Atlantic every day. (National News, 21st)</p>
<p>Saving the Military Reduction Stalemate</p>
<h3>Italy Takes on the Role of Mediator: Proposes Three Recommendations, First Seeking British Agreement</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent stated that a majority of British cabinet members will make every effort to reach a consensus with Italy for a final mediation between France and Germany. It is heard that Rome will submit a recommendation to Britain by the Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Suvich. This negotiation will begin here on Sunday. It is said that the content of the Italian recommendation will be premised on Britain and Italy being in a voting position on military reduction, security, and armament ratios, and the following points will also be discussed at the Anglo-Italian London meeting:</p>
<p>(1) The term of the Franco-German agreement; (2) Guarantees for the implementation of the disarmament convention; (3) The timing, location, and method for presenting this issue;</p>
<p>On this point, both London and Rome advocate solving it through diplomatic negotiations, which would be beneficial even if the main committee and general assembly of the disarmament were postponed. (National News, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations is currently discussing the postponement of the main committee meeting on disarmament. The British side seems to advocate holding the meeting as scheduled on April 27, while the French side advocates postponing it to May 14, which is the session of the League of Nations Council. The French side believes that the main committee is nothing more than a formality and what steps should be taken after this should be decided by the General Committee. All opinions consider this to be a meaningless dispute. (National News, 21st)</p>
<p>Italian Undersecretary Suvich departs for London this afternoon to discuss disarmament and other general issues with British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, and other British politicians. The Italian side hopes that Suvich's trip will promote efforts to break the disarmament stalemate. It is heard that Suvich believes that a limited disarmament convention is better than no disarmament convention at all. It is heard that since the British disarmament plan was not accepted, Italy's attitude is that Germany should now be allowed to reorganize its defensive military equipment and station 300,000 short-term soldiers, while other European powers should maintain their current status. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, if clear and important guarantees can be given for the implementation of the disarmament convention, the French government's opposition to Germany's rearmament may change and not remain resolute. The cabinet will study this issue. Italian Undersecretary Suvich will arrive here tomorrow. The British government will ask what kind of guarantees can be recognized by Italy. If Italy and Britain can agree on this level, Britain can be expected to re-engage with France on the disarmament issue. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Italian Undersecretary Passes Through Paris: Talks with the French Premier Are Quite Harmonious</h3>
<p>(Paris) Premier Doumergue received Italian Foreign</p>
<p>Undersecretary Suvich today. According to the Petit Parisien, Suvich will convey to the French Premier Prime Minister Mussolini's intention to continue negotiations based on Italy's disarmament plan. It is heard that France is also willing to seek understanding on the condition that Germany returns to the League of Nations. (National News, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Italian Undersecretary Suvich went to Britain to reciprocate, arriving here at 9:50 this morning from Rome. He met with Premier Doumergue at 10:30, and set off for London at 12:20. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the talks between Doumergue and Suvich, stating only that "Mr. Suvich was going to England, passing through here, and made a special visit to Premier Doumergue. The two talked for an hour, and the situation was very harmonious." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Visits Poland and Czechoslovakia: Seeking Support for Disarmament Policy</h3>
<p>(Paris) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck and Czech Foreign Minister Benes have visited France one after another. Former Foreign Minister Ponger had originally planned to visit Poland and Czechoslovakia in return, but the cabinet was overthrown and Ponger left office, so it did not happen. This proposal has now been realized. Foreign Minister Barthou set off for Warsaw and the Czech capital today to reciprocate. He is scheduled to arrive in Warsaw on the 22nd and stay for two days, arrive in the Czech capital on the 25th, stay for three days, and return home on the 29th. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Barthou, seeking support against German rearmament, departed yesterday for Warsaw and Prague. Disarmament talks are currently suspended, so the French Foreign Minister's trip aims to strengthen the alliance between France and Poland and the Little Entente. After consulting with Poland to eliminate differences between the two countries, he will go to Prague and then to Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. Poland recently suddenly signed a ten-year treaty of friendship with Germany, which suddenly changed the relationship between France and Poland. Poland then urged France to follow its lead and accept Hitler's proposal to negotiate a non-aggression agreement. The friendship between France and Poland has therefore cooled down, as the French authorities fear that Poland will be deceived by the treaty, allowing Germany to leisurely plan to invade Poland. If so, France is bound by the Franco-Polish treaty and must rise up to rescue Poland. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Germania's correspondent in Warsaw published an article in the newspaper, commenting on French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to Warsaw. The tone was clearly different from the German press's comments in recent days. The newspaper's commentary on the relationship between Poland and France stated, "It is wrong to say that the relationship between Poland and France is cooling down, but it is not impossible to say that Poland can slightly change its attitude towards France. When French Foreign Minister Barthou arrives in Warsaw, the Polish authorities can explain to him that Poland's adoption of a peaceful policy is also of great benefit to France's interests. At present, Poland can set an example for negotiating with other opposing countries when it has signed a treaty of friendship, a treaty of alliance, and other treaties with one opposing country. Poland is no longer an ally that only adds to the burden in the international community, but a country that all parties are eager to connect with. Poland can express this by itself." The Berlin Stock Exchange reported that "Poland has known to reorganize its relations with neighboring countries. If France wants to continue its alliance with Poland, Poland can also propose conditions, because Poland is now in no danger and does not need France to rescue it." However, the report also said that Poland may take a hostile attitude towards Germany on military issues, which Germany may not be able to predict. Germany must guard against this. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>French Premier's Radio Address: Defends Disarmament Policy, Demands Guarantees for Self-Security, Does Not Harbor Hostile Feelings Towards Other Countries, Urges People to Unite and Lay the Foundation for National Affairs</h3>
<p>(Paris) Premier Doumergue delivered a radio address today that was broadcast throughout France and even parts of Europe. In his speech, Doumergue strongly defended France's attitude in the world's disarmament, stating that the French government's disarmament memorandum to the British government on April 17 was resolute, not out of hatred for the world, and not without ensuring France's own security to avoid a recurrence of the European war tragedy. "Looking back on the past, we cannot take risks for the safety of the future. We must remember that when France proposed to continue disarmament, those who invaded our country and destroyed our homes were not recognized by the nations. Violating the current peace treaty, we proceeded to increase our armaments. I firmly believe that all countries in the world should understand France's feelings and sympathize with why France needs greater guarantees. We must find accurate and unswerving guarantees, and the hard work will be clear to the world." Regarding the currency issue, Doumergue opposed the devaluation of the franc, and said that the government would do its best to maintain the current gold standard. Doumergue said, "We should work hard to maintain the price of the franc. Only speculators who seize by force hope for the devaluation of the currency." Doumergue hoped to restore the government's power, so in his conclusion, he solemnly issued his most important declaration since taking office as Premier two months ago: "If we do not do this, we will only fall into anarchy, and the result will only lead to civil war and foreign invasion." (National News, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Premier Doumergue made a radio broadcast today, appealing to the French people to unite and not fight each other, saying that internal division of the country is tantamount to national suicide. He continued that the government had to cut salaries in order to balance the budget, and the veterans had accepted the sacrifice in an upright spirit, which was commendable. The civil servants who opposed the salary cut were still ashamed of it. Civil servants believed that the franc would eventually be devalued, but they had not done everything in their power to prevent this disaster. Our franc is now commensurate with the value of the gold market, and we must maintain its value. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Results of the Paris Riot: More Than Two Hundred Injured, More Than a Thousand Arrested and Released</h3>

<h3>Spain: General Strike: Attempting to Overthrow the Current Cabinet</h3>
<p>Madrid The working class is now very unstable, attempting to overthrow the current cabinet of L'Lut. It has launched a 24-hour general strike starting at midnight today. At the same time, major cities in Spain are also holding protest strikes. According to those close to the government, the Spanish cabinet is prepared to deal with countermeasures. If the strikers take any overstepping actions to overthrow the government, they will be executed. Today's strike is clearly a continuation of the Communist Party's strike three weeks ago. It is said that the motive for the strike is to resist the brutal behavior of the police. (National News, 22nd)</p>
<p>Madrid After the transport workers announced a strike last night, a general strike has begun here. The authorities immediately took preventive measures. More than 100 people were arrested last night. Members of the militia were armed and patrolled the city. All public institutions were guarded by shock troops. The number of private vehicles on the streets was reduced sharply. Because the announcement of the general strike was due to the Russian inclination, the residents were greatly shocked. The sanitation workers of the city government participated in the general strike, resulting in no one moving the household garbage. However, all the newspapers were published this morning, so the newspaper vendors on the street were quite noisy. The government has tried to ensure that there will be no shortage of bread. Military vehicles have been distributing bread since 8:00 this morning. So far, the railway has not been affected by the strike. The regular trains and the special trains to the Aescorial Congress this morning all ran as usual. So far, no disasters have occurred. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Silver Problem: Important White House Meeting – Silver as Currency – No Concrete Decision</h3>
<p>(Washington, Today, President Roosevelt held discussions with silver faction congressmen at the White House until the afternoon. The result apparently was the inability to designate silver as currency. After the meeting concluded, the White House spokesperson stated only that they had thoroughly discussed the monetary situation worldwide, including gold and silver issues, and that further discussions would be needed. Congressional representatives were unwilling to express opinions about the meeting, saying only that there was little progress. An Associated Press reporter approached Senator Harrison, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, just as Harrison was leaving the White House. Harrison said that they had fully exchanged opinions on silver, but there was no decision. Before visiting the President, silver faction senators held a meeting in Congress, believing that designating silver as currency again was necessary to improve the national economic situation, clear debts, and revitalize commerce. According to attendees speaking to the Associated Press, they were determined to demand the compulsory passage of a silver bill during this session when they went to the White House. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt and silver faction leaders conferred at the White House today regarding the resumption of silver coinage, an official announcement was released stating that the entire world monetary problem, including gold and silver coinage, had been thoroughly discussed, and further meetings would be held. Senator Harrison said that today's meeting was extremely sympathetic to each other, and if legislation was necessary, he believed that a satisfactory bill could be obtained. Senator King said that they had studied the resumption of silver coinage from all aspects. However, the silver faction still insists on passing concrete procedures for implementation, rather than authorizing the President to decide on action when he deems it necessary. Attendees at the White House meeting included Senators Borah, Thomas, McCarran, Adams, Sheppard, and King, led into the White House by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Pittman and Finance Committee Chairman Harrison. It is rumored that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also participated in this meeting. Before going to the White House, King said that silver faction congressmen gathered this morning and decided to declare to President Roosevelt their desire for a mandatory silver bill and their opposition to permissive legislation, informing him that in order to restore commerce, resolve debt problems, and supply the necessary circulating medium, a silver bill must be passed during this congressional session. After knowing President Roosevelt's correct attitude, the core committee of the silver faction may reconvene on Sunday to decide on its policy. (21st Reuters)</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Drops: US Government Prepares to Sell Gold</h3>
<p>(Washington) A Treasury Department spokesman declared, "The dollar exchange rate has repeatedly fallen, reaching below the 'gold point' (meaning that when the foreign exchange reaches below the gold point, gold is prone to flow to other countries). Anyone who requests to ship out gold from the Treasury Department can be approved." Treasury Secretary Morgenthau issued a statement to the press, confirming that if foreign countries make demands on the United States, the US government is prepared to sell gold.

<h3>Financial Blockade Against Europe to be Implemented</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Johnson Act, a policy of financial blockade against countries that have not repaid their US debts, has been promulgated by the President and is now in the implementation phase. According to news from Washington, US banks are refusing to discount checks and other negotiable instruments issued by the French Treasury due to the implementation of the Johnson Act. The French Treasury Department has now requested a precise explanation from the US government through diplomatic channels. Official opinion believes that this attitude of US banks is due to an improper interpretation of the provisions of the Johnson Act, which is likely an error or an interpretation of the law that exceeds its original scope.

It also stipulates that the production of standard cotton exceeding this limit will be taxed at 50% of the market price, payable at the time of ginning. (21st Reuters)</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Province: Rural Revitalization Underway; National Economic Commission Allocates Construction Funds; Agricultural College Actively Working After Establishment</h3>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Jiangxi has suffered from banditry for eight years, with eighty-one counties almost entirely ravaged. Among the eighteen million farmers, aside from those who perished, all are groaning in broken rural villages, urgently needing relief. Therefore, the National Economic Commission is engaged in rural construction and production development. According to political circles, the National Economic Commission has approved 1.9 million yuan for Jiangxi rural construction, allocated from the US cotton and wheat loan. The Commission has appointed the director of the Agricultural Bureau of the Commission and Xiao Chunjin, chairman of the Jiangxi Economic Commission, and two others to conduct investigations as a preliminary plan, and has established a resident office of the Economic Commission in Jiangxi. The Agricultural College, responsible for revitalizing rural Jiangxi and improving rural technology, has been formally established. However, because the 1.9 million yuan in construction funds has not yet been issued, Chairman Jiang specifically borrowed 100,000 yuan from the one million yuan allocated by the Economic Commission for bandit suppression and fundamental governance as start-up funds. As for the college's organization, in addition to the board of directors, there is one president, appointed to be Dong Shijin. All agricultural vocational schools, agricultural experiment stations, and forest farms are under its jurisdiction. The annual operating expenses are 150,000 yuan, and the temporary expenses are 200,000 yuan. The planned initiatives to be implemented first include: (A) Plant Production: breeding rice, cotton, ramie, and tobacco, cultivating tea, citrus, and peaches, preventing and controlling plant diseases and pests, surveying soil, and cultivating seedlings for afforestation; (B) Animal Production: breeding pigs, chickens, and ducks, preventing and controlling cattle and pig diseases, and manufacturing serum; (C) Agricultural Economics: agricultural product marketing, farm management, adjusting land and tenancy issues, crop forecasting, and wasteland reclamation; (D) Agricultural Education and Training of Technical Personnel: training extension workers. All of the above will be implemented in order.</p>

<p>Northwest Inspection Report</p>
<h3>Special Correspondent Geng Ya: Educational Improvements in Suiyuan Province</h3>
<p>The education situation in Suiyuan: Director Yan Zhiyuan of the Education Expansion Department discussed that the province has seven provincial secondary schools, including two middle schools, two normal schools for men, two normal schools for women, and one vocational school. The two middle schools are in Baotou, the two normal schools are in Jining, and the remainder, along with five primary schools, are in the provincial capital. The primary school division has recently established a Boy Scout troop. However, due to the difficult financial situation of the students' families and the shortage of school funds, the organization and promotion have encountered some difficulties. High school students are undergoing military training, having already received rifles and are engaged in drills. A scholarship examination is planned for May. Students from all schools with scores above 70 points are eligible to take the exam. The provincial education administrative conference will also continue to be held, and a plan to reorganize education at all levels has recently been drafted, aiming to implement it step by step as follows:</p>
<p>Secondary Education: (A) Normal Schools: Funding for normal schools already accounts for 60% of secondary education funding, exceeding the 25% that the ministry stipulates. Future efforts will not focus on quantitative increases but on qualitative improvements. The methods are: (I) Establishing a system: From the 23rd year onwards, Provincial Normal School No. 1 will be a complete normal school. The normal school and its affiliated middle school will each have three classes. The Second Normal School will be a four-year simple normal school, completing a four-class scale. The Women's Normal School is the same. The normal school class of Zhongshan College (reorganized from the Five Ethnicities College) will no longer recruit students after graduation and will be converted into a vocational school. Completing the class sizes by the 25th year is a mandatory goal. (II) Enriching facilities: Raising funds to allow schools to purchase books, instruments, specimens, etc. as soon as possible to increase teaching effectiveness. (III) Increasing rural teachers: If the amount of provincial funds used exceeds the proportional number even more, then the counties should jointly establish schools, with the establishment of three locations as a mandatory goal.</p>
<p>(B) Middle Schools: Suiyuan Province has established middle schools for the longest time. The academic level of junior high school students is not much different from that of other provinces in the interior. However, there are too few schools, and the senior high school level is too superficial. The improvement methods are: (I) Expanding junior high schools: The existing three junior high schools graduate three classes each year, which is insufficient for the enrollment of senior high schools, normal schools, and vocational schools. It is planned to establish an affiliated junior high school within Provincial Normal School No. 1 from the 23rd year, limited to three classes. By the 25th year, the Women's Normal School and the Second Normal School will each establish affiliated middle schools, also limited to three classes. By the 27th year, six classes of junior high school students can graduate each year, which is a mandatory goal. (II) Improving senior high schools: Temporarily, no increase in class sizes, but first focus on enriching the content to avoid the concern that those going to Peiping and Tianjin for further studies will fail. As for the rampant academic atmosphere, frequent disturbances, and frequent class suspensions, these are also aspects that should be rectified and improved.</p>
<p>(C) Vocational Schools: There is one old junior vocational school with four classes of agricultural science. It is planned to gradually expand it to store up productive talents for economic construction. The methods are: (I) Reorganizing existing vocational schools: From the 23rd year onwards, add an animal husbandry department and establish agricultural and pastoral workshops near the provincial capital for students to practice. Construct school buildings and move the school site in order to facilitate student practice. Instruments, specimens, books, etc., used in teaching should be added year by year. (II) Adding industrial vocational schools: Because Suiyuan Province is a region that produces wool and leather, raw materials are exported to foreign countries every year, and then the finished wool fabrics and leather goods are sold in the province, which is not an economic way. It is planned to establish an industrial vocational school within Zhongshan College from the 23rd year, with two classes of advanced wool weaving and two classes of elementary leather making to cultivate production talents as a mandatory task. A portion of the education fund should be extracted to establish a wool weaving and leather making factory, using talents from the province to make raw materials from the province, and transporting the finished products to the outside to build the economic foundation of the province. (III) Establishing various vocational training classes: The above-mentioned vocational schools focus on agricultural and industrial subjects. Other simple vocational classes such as domestic animal raising, cooking, washing, sewing, repairing clocks, installing telephones, midwifery, surveying, and soap making will be held gradually as needed in various places. Among them, soap making, midwifery, and telephone installation classes should be opened first.</p>
<p>Higher Education: The number of senior high school graduates in Suiyuan Province is very small, and it is not necessary to establish specialized schools above the junior college level for the time being. For the purpose of cultivating specialized talents, first stipulate the amount of overseas study subsidies to encourage students to pursue further education and study abroad. The methods are: (I) For students studying at designated domestic universities, the subsidy is temporarily set at 100 yuan before the 25th year, with the goal of cultivating talents in agriculture, industry, science, and medicine, with a total quota of 56 people, followed by 12 in education, 10 in literature, and 22 in other subjects. Those with higher grades should receive the subsidy first, and those with better grades in the same grade should be given priority. (II) For overseas study, it is tentatively set at five people in the West, with each person receiving a subsidy of 2,400 yuan per year, also with the aim of cultivating outstanding talents in agriculture, industry, science, and medicine. (III) Establishing specialized schools can be postponed for the time being as needed. Elementary Education: A. Improving elementary schools: Most public and private elementary schools in Suiyuan Province are incompletely equipped, textbooks are complicated, and funding is not standardized. It is planned to stipulate a reorganization method from the 23rd year onwards: (I) Standardizing funding standards: Each county education bureau should use uniform averages as the principle for the funding of subordinate elementary schools. The salary of teachers should be two to four times the cost of living of an average person in the area, as the highest and lowest salary standards for teachers. (II) Unifying the curriculum: The department will set up an editorial committee to review the textbooks used in elementary schools. Only those that meet the ministry's standards can be used, otherwise they will be prohibited, in order to increase educational efficiency. (III) Certifying teachers. (IV) Screening private elementary schools: Most private elementary schools in Suiyuan Province are established by churches, nominally elementary schools, but in reality, they are aimed at evangelization. Children who graduate only know about religion, and they know nothing about national concepts and national thoughts. They should be carefully investigated. If they do not meet the standards set by the ministry and are actually evangelizing, they should be strictly banned to emphasize national education.</p>
<p>In addition, establish kindergartens. From the 23rd year, establish two locations in the provincial capital first and gradually extend them to various counties. The teachers will be hired from outside for the time being. Expand social education by implementing adult literacy education, planning public literacy schools, and enriching and promoting public education centers and libraries, striving to enable all illiterate people in the province aged 19 to 50 to receive some form of literacy education within ten years with the most economical money and time. At a minimum, they must be able to read popular books and newspapers.</p>
<p>Later, at the provincial government, I met with Secretary-General Zeng Houzai and learned that the monthly government expenditure in Suiyuan Province is less than 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, and the monthly military expenditure is about 240,000 yuan. The tax revenue is far from sufficient, and it is difficult to make up the deficit. Efforts are being made to tighten spending, but the necessary funds for improving education should be spent as much as possible according to the approved budget. In that case, if education in Suiyuan Province is implemented according to the Education Department's improvement plan, there will be significant progress.</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang's Telegram Reports Fierce Battles in Northern Sichuan: 5th Route Army Kills Over 1,000 Bandits, Captures Over 400</h3>
<p>Chengdu air dispatch: Liu Xiang issued an order to the various armies a few days ago, setting a deadline of one month to recover Tongjiang. Therefore, the front-line battles are quite fierce. On the afternoon of the fifth day, the 5th Route Army attacked the dangerous formations in the Niupanzhen and Qianqiuzhen areas. The area above is a hanging cliff, and below is a deep ravine. The bandits used veteran bandits who had fought between Hubei and Henan to reinforce and counterattack, attempting to force the government troops to fall off the cliff and die. If the government troops had retreated slightly at that time, they would all have become ghosts under the cliff. Fortunately, the government troops fought to the death in an uphill charge for six hours. The air force and artillery units also intensified their bombing, and only then did they stabilize the position. At night, they launched a fierce attack with elite troops, crossed many hanging cliffs and deep ditches, and stormed multiple key points at 3:00 AM on the 16th, cutting the bandits into several sections and blocking the Little River (also known as the Tongjiang River) everywhere, completely occupying the area. Both sides suffered heavy casualties in this battle, which was an unprecedented fierce battle since the Sichuan army suppressed bandits. In the past two days, the government troops and the main force of the bandits also had a major bloody battle, capturing more than 400 bandits. About 1,700 to 1,800 bodies of bandits were left on the battlefield. More than 100 symbols of fake supervisory officers and fake regimental, battalion, company, and platoon leaders were found on the bodies. Liu Xiang recently sent a telegram to the central government, reporting on the bandit suppression battles in recent days. The original text is as follows: (I) According to the telegram from Li Jiaxu, the commander of the general headquarters, on the 17th, after Li's brigade occupied Longcheng, they occupied Qingjiangdu at 4:00 PM today. The bandits retreated to Shaniuping. Yang's army of the Fourth Army occupied the Leishanping area at 1:00 PM today. The bandits retreated to Desheng Mountain. (II) According to the telegram from Acting Division Commander Xu Shaozong on the morning of the 15th and 16th, progress has been slower in recent days due to rain and fog. Today the weather cleared, and the 7th and 8th Brigades were used as the attacking forces, and the 9th Brigade was used as the reserve. The attack continued. From morning to noon, the battle was fierce. The bandits stubbornly resisted with danger, and repeatedly fought hand-to-hand before breaking through and firmly occupying the various points of Tianxian's Felt Hat Mountain, Eagle Back Mouth, and Daekou. The bandits reinforced and counterattacked, but our division met them head-on and dealt them a heavy blow. They failed and fled to the Jinlongtai, Wangjin Temple, and Zhenlongguan areas. On the night of the 15th, the division again sent teams to attack the bandit positions in the Mashikou and Jinlongtai areas at night. The bandits could not hold on and fled to Zhenlongguan at 2:00 AM. Our various units are taking advantage of the situation to pursue and advance towards Shuangtanzi and Kuzhutan, and ordered them to cross the river quickly and seize the Zhenlongguan position. (III) According to the telegram from Deputy Commander Fan Shaozeng on the morning of the 15th, it was ordered that the Liao Brigade launch a feigned attack on the Qubin Pass line to divide the bandit forces, and then order the Meng Brigade to charge up Luodingzhen, and the Fan Brigade to attack Simenping and then attack Luodingzhen. After the fierce attack began before dawn, the various units advanced victoriously. At 9:00, the Meng Brigade reached the foot of Luodingzhen, and the Fan Brigade also occupied Tumenping at the same time, advancing to Niupanping. Because the terrain was dangerous and the fortifications were solid, progress was quite difficult. Meng Brigade was ordered to seal off the right side of Luodingzhen and detour to Fuxingping. After a fierce battle until noon, they were about to break through when the bandits used three regiments to counterattack our right wing from the Niupanping area, engaging in close combat. After a fierce battle until 2:00 PM, the Fan Brigade held their ground with the bandits in the new position and ordered the Meng Brigade to launch a night attack from the original route. The Liao Brigade increased the troops from Yuanshanping and charged up Luodingzhen, encouraging most of the troops to climb Dongjialiang to the right rear of the bandits with heavy rewards. The bandits suffered this major threat, and the entire line was shaken. The Liao Brigade occupied Luodingzhen at night, and the bandits fled in disarray towards Changtan River. It is estimated that the battle was fierce, and our gains were quite large, and the bandits left corpses all over the field. In addition to ordering them to take advantage of the victory and pursue and suppress them early to achieve complete success, I would like to report to you, Liu Xiang (18th) seal.

<h3>Fujian Security Regiment: Chen and Lin's Troops Disarmed; Behavior of Trampling on People is No Different from Bandits; Chen Yucai Escapes, Lin Jing is Detained</h3>
<p>Xiamen dispatch: The Fujian provincial militia was recently reorganized by the provincial government into the 14th regiment of the Security Corps, most of whom were bandits accumulated in Fujian Province for many years. On the 17th of this month, the 4th Regiment of Chen Yucai's troops was disarmed because they harassed the people and could not be reformed. The 7th Regiment of Lin Jing was disarmed because they harmed the people and did not obey orders. The disarmaments were carried out by Song Xilian, the commander of the 36th Division and commander of the Quanzhou Garrison, and the director of the Southern District Security Sub-office. The details of the disarmaments are as follows:</p>
<p>After Song Xilian learned about the illegal activities of Chen and Lin's troops, he requested and received approval from Provincial Chairman Chen Yi to disarm them. On the evening of the 16th, Song invited Chen Yucai and Liu Chaoran, the commander of the 13th Regiment, and officers above the battalion commander level from both units to a banquet. Liu and his subordinates all arrived, but Chen and Battalion Commanders Shi Decheng and Chen Weijin did not arrive. Only Deputy Regiment Commander Lu Yankun, Third Battalion Commander Li Xiong (also known as Li Zuyi, a notorious bandit from Anxi), and Quartermaster Huang arrived. Song personally accompanied them. After the banquet, Song asked Liu and his subordinates to retire. Lu and the other three were immediately detained. At 10:00 PM that night, Zhang Bin, the chief of staff of the 36th Division, led Li Zhipeng, the commander of the 212th Regiment, with four companies of soldiers, and set off in fourteen long-distance buses. At 10:30 PM, they arrived at Shuanggou, got off the bus and walked, leaving two platoons of infantry to surround Qingyang. One company of Chen's troops initially resisted slightly, but soon surrendered all their weapons. The rest continued to advance to Shishi. At dawn on the 17th, they arrived in Shishi. Except for one company stationed in Qingyang and one company stationed in Jinjiang, all of Chen's troops were stationed in Shishi. They were also unprepared and resisted hastily. Under the encirclement, except for some who abandoned their guns and fled, the rest were all disarmed. Two platoons were also sent to Jinjiang to disarm the company. Before noon, it had all been resolved. A total of more than 580 people were captured, including more than 20 officers. More than 700 long and short guns and several automatic rifles were seized. At 3:00 PM, they were escorted to Quanzhou. Chen Yucai returned to Jiudu on the 16th to hold a Taoist ritual for his mother. On the morning of the 17th, he took a car to Quanzhou. He entered the West Gate to the front of Kaiyuan Temple, heard the news, immediately reversed the car, went out of the West Gate and escaped.</p>
<p>Lin Jing received Song's telegram on the 16th, saying that he would personally come to Putian on the 17th to give instructions. At about 7:00 AM on the 17th, Song personally led a battalion of infantry, accompanied by Lin Fujing, deputy director of the Security Sub-office, and went to Putian. The troops departed from Cianshi and Luoyang by car. Song and Lin took about 20 guards and drove ahead. At about 9:00, they arrived at Laixi, where a part of Lin's troops was stationed. Song ordered the guards to disarm them and imprison them in one place. The troops continued to arrive, resting in Laixi for an hour, and heading towards Putian. Song still took Lin and the guards to the city outside the city first. Lin Jing led the special task company to meet them. Song invited them to enter the city in the same car and rested at the county government. Song ordered Lin to assemble his subordinate officers to give instructions. Lin was embarrassed, but had to comply. At that time, Lin's troops had gathered in the North Stadium to listen to the instructions, and the Xiong Battalion that Song brought also arrived. On the one hand, Lin Jing and his 33 subordinate officers were detained in the county government, and on the other hand, the Xiong Battalion had surrounded the North Stadium according to prior instructions, guarding the key points of each city gate. Except for a small number who abandoned their weapons and escaped from the army, all the remaining officers and soldiers' weapons were seized. Xiong then sent a company to Jiangkou, Hanjiang, to completely disarm Lin's troops in both places. After Lin's troops were resolved, Song left the Xiong Battalion to be stationed in Putian, and all the captured soldiers were temporarily handed over to the Chamber of Commerce to maintain food and drink. Lin and his 33 subordinate officers and all their weapons were escorted to Quanzhou on the 18th. Song and Lin also returned to Quanzhou on the 18th. In the two disarmaments, only three soldiers were injured in Shishi. Chen's troops suffered fewer casualties. In Putian, a platoon leader was injured, two soldiers were injured, and Lin's troops suffered more than ten deaths and more than ten injuries. Lin Jing and 33 others, including Battalion Commander Yang Daguan, were imprisoned in the stone room of the division headquarters.</p>
<p>Song Xilian issued a statement in Quanzhou on the 18th, saying, "Chen Yucai was originally stationed in Anxi Yongchun, exploiting and oppressing the people, and acting arbitrarily for a long time, which has long been criticized by everyone. The government's incorporation was originally intended to allow him to change his ways and start anew. Recently, the head of this sub-office went to Shishi to inspect the troops and saw that the officers and soldiers had no military knowledge and their faces were filled with opium. They could not be reformed. Lin Jing was originally stationed in Xianyou, committing all kinds of evil. The people have suffered from his trampling for many years. The government's incorporation was intended to give him a new start, but the troops stationed in Fenggaiwei still followed their old habits. The people's accusations piled up like mountains. When the 87th Division was transferred, the troops actually opened and stationed in Putian without authorization. When they were ordered to transfer to Fuqing, they refused to obey. Then they were transferred to Gutian, but they were slow to move. They disobeyed orders and were no different from bandits. Therefore, both troops were resolved." According to reports, Chen Yucai was the former commander of the First Regiment of Chen Guohui's troops, a bandit accumulated in southern Fujian. When the 19th Route Army gathered in Hui'an for reorganization, Chen colluded with Shi Baoqi's regiment to break through the siege and escape to Nan'an. Lin was a bandit accumulated in Putian Xianyou. Recently, there was the incident of shooting and killing Lin Chunming, a party leader in Xianyou. The crimes of both people are well known to the people of Fujian. Song's words are still not exhaustive of their evils. (April 20th)</p>
<h3>Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces: Yellow River Aftercare Project Plan; Executive Yuan Orders Shandong Provincial Government to Comply</h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch: The Executive Yuan previously received a plan for dike and embankment repair from the Joint Yellow River Affairs Association of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces, which required approximately 12 million yuan. Subsequently, it received a response from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission regarding the Yellow River aftercare project and proposed construction methods, roughly divided into four parts: (I) Repairing dikes and embankments in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong Provinces; (II) Improving river channels in the three provinces; (III) Reinforcing the Taihang Dike in Henan Province and the Jin Dike in Hebei Province; (IV) Shandong Provincial Government requested to reorganize the lower reaches of Lijin, with the engineering corps building a large dike, and the Shanxi and Shaanxi Provincial Governments requested to repair various dikes, totaling more than 14 million yuan, which is roughly consistent. There are regulations on the allocation and management of funds and the authority to guide the project. The Executive Yuan has now instructed the governments of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi Provinces to comply. At today's (20th) provincial government meeting, the Secretariat reported the instruction and decided to order the Construction Department to handle it. The full text of the Executive Yuan's instruction is as follows: The Executive Yuan's instruction states: The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has submitted a case and responded, regarding the handling of the Yellow River aftercare project, seeking approval for the allocation of construction funds and proposing construction methods, requesting instructions, etc. After investigation, the situation described is quite detailed. Regarding the scope and planning of the project, the commission believes that it should be divided into four items: (I) Repairing dikes and embankments in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong Provinces; (II) Improving river channels in the three provinces; (III) Reinforcing the Taihang Dike in Henan Province and the Jin Dike in Hebei Province; (IV) Shandong Provincial Government requested to reorganize the lower reaches of Lijin, with the engineering corps building a large dike, and the Shanxi Provincial Government stated that it was planning to build dikes in Hejin, Ronghe, Linjin, and Yongji. The Shaanxi Provincial Government stated that it was planning to build dikes in Pingmin, Chaoyi, and Hanguan. The planning of this project must go through four procedures: survey, measurement, mapping, and design. The progress of the project must also consider the urgency and be divided into stages to be handled in order. The commission is planning to use the above-mentioned repair of dikes and embankments in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong Provinces and the improvement of river channels in the three provinces, from the Pinghan Railway Bridge to the Jinpu Railway Bridge, as the first step of the project to be handled. The area west of the Pinghan Railway Bridge to Wenxian and east of the Pingpu Railway Bridge to Lijin, and the reinforcement of the Taihang Dike in Henan Province and the Jin Dike in Hebei Province, will be the second step of the project to be handled. The reorganization of the engineering corps' dike construction in the lower reaches of Lijin and the dike construction projects in Hejin, Shanxi, and Pingmin, Shaanxi, belong to the projects outside the first and second steps. The planning is still considered appropriate. However, the Yellow River aftercare project should be supervised by the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee in accordance with the original plan passed by the 150th meeting of this Yuan, together with the commission and the river affairs bureaus of the respective provinces, dividing the work and cooperating. The planning of the scope of this project should be reviewed and approved by the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee. In addition to the reorganization of the engineering corps' dike construction project in the lower reaches of Lijin, which has been planned and submitted for review in a separate case, the procedures that should be followed for the first and second steps of the project and the plans for the dike construction projects in Hejin, Shanxi, and Pingmin, Shaanxi, are said to be under preparation and should be quickly prepared and submitted for review. Regarding the raising and management of construction funds, the commission stated that the exact number of construction funds needed for this Yellow River aftercare project and the detailed plan have not yet been completed, and it is difficult to estimate accurately, which is a realistic situation. The approximate estimated number is approximately 8 million yuan for the first step of the project, approximately 6 million yuan for the second step of the project, and approximately 2 million yuan for the projects in Lijin, Shandong, Hejin, Shanxi, and Pingmin, Shaanxi, totaling more than 14 million yuan, which is roughly consistent with the previous claim of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee that the three provinces estimated that the aftercare and temporary flood control projects required a total of more than 14 million yuan, and with the plan proposed by the Joint Yellow River Affairs Association of the three provinces that the dike and embankment repair project of the Yellow River in the three provinces was estimated to require more than 12 million yuan. The commission believes that the plan proposed by the Joint Yellow River Affairs Association of the three provinces is not detailed enough, and in order to plan ahead and start work in a timely manner, the plan can be used as a standard for raising funds. In addition, the three methods for统筹款項 passed by the 150th meeting of this Yuan, regarding the additional donations from railways, telecommunications, and ships, the issuance of bonds by the three provinces for blocking and building after the Yellow River breach, and the allocation of US cotton and wheat loans by the National Economic Commission, should be统筹办理 by this Yuan and implemented as soon as possible. In the future, the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee should be responsible for the allocation and management of funds, which is not without merit. The Yellow River Flood Relief Committee should be responsible for统筹办理, and the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways should separately review and reply to the number of additional donations from railways, telecommunications, and ships, the number of bonds that Henan, Hebei, and Shandong Provinces should issue, and the National Economic Commission should review and reply to the amount of US cotton and wheat loans allocated, so that they can be handed over to the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee for统筹办理. Regarding the implementation and supervision of the project, the commission believes that it should be handled under the guidance of this Yuan and the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, but the projects handled by the river affairs bureaus of the various provinces must be carried out step by step in accordance with the design of the commission. As for the strict obedience to the technical guidance of the commission during the implementation, if there are any plans that have not been approved by the commission in advance, and there are temporary acts that do not comply with technical principles, and they have not been corrected at any time, the commission may request the fund management agency to suspend the payment of funds in accordance with the law, in addition to submitting a request to stop or revoke them, in order to ensure that the funds are not wasted and the project returns to practicality. This is to unify the authority and show prudence, and should be followed by the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee and the governments of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi Provinces. In addition to instructing and函達 the National Economic Commission to take note and分行, the original submission is also copied and sent urgently, instructing the provincial government to comply.

<h3>Near Total Eradication of Opium Poppies in Chaoxian County Reported That Poppy Seedlings Are Expected to Be Completely Eradicated Bloody Suppression of Opium Poppy Eradication in Hefei</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In Anhui Province, the suppression of opium poppy seedlings in Chaoxian County has led to resistance from local villagers' Red Spear Society, White Flag Society, and Yellow Spear Society, resulting in clashes with security teams from Wuhu, Wuwei, and other counties. This has escalated into a bloody tragedy with over a hundred casualties. Supervisors Gao Yihan and Yang Lianggong of the Central Supervisory Yuan telegraphed Commissioner Wang of Wuhu yesterday to investigate the truth. Today, the Commissioner's Office received a telegram from Hu Peigeng, Deputy Commander of the Security Forces, reporting from Chaoxian County that the local groups have largely disintegrated after a severe crackdown. Only about 300 people are entrenched in the Dashu Liu area, still attempting resistance. The Chaoxian Red Swastika Society has taken on the role of mediator. All security teams have been on alert in recent days, providing cover for the poppy eradication teams to advance and eradicate the poppies. Villagers still fire shots from time to time. Nearby villages are mostly deserted, reportedly due to villagers being coerced into the mountains by the groups. Deputy Commander Hu has issued a proclamation urging villagers to hand over all firearms, knives, and spears to the district chiefs for transfer to the county government, promising their return after the reorganization of the local militia. Except for the ringleaders Wu Zhongding and Fang Lihua, who will be arrested and prosecuted, the coerced masses will be exempt from prosecution. It is expected that the poppy seedlings will be completely eradicated within a day or two, and all types of spear societies can be disbanded and eliminated. The Wuwei County security team suffered the most casualties in this operation. The county's education bureau and other agencies have telegraphed the Security Command here to request generous compensation. A similar incident occurred in Hefei. Yesterday, Hefei County Magistrate Guo Pingri personally led a security team to inspect and eradicate poppy seedlings in the Lan'ganji area of the northeast countryside. Villagers with a Red Spear Society organization also rose up in resistance with great momentum. Government troops responded with hand grenades and rifles, bravely firing, resulting in over a dozen deaths among the spear society members and countless injuries. Many abandoned their weapons and fled. Fearing they were hiding, the government troops set fire to several villages, including Xujiagang and Xiaohu Village. They also ordered local leaders to automatically eradicate the poppies. The area has now been relatively pacified. In this operation, two government soldiers died and three were injured. Among the villagers who died, four Bian brothers were killed simultaneously, creating a tragic scene. (19th)</p>
<h3>Qingpu Police Officer Training Class Scheduled to Open</h3>

Preparations are reportedly complete, instructors and lecturers have been appointed, and the class is scheduled to open on May 1st.</p>
<h3>Three Families in Diaobang Village Robbed Consecutively</h3>
<p>The families of farmers Jin Yongxiang, Jin Fengxiang, and Jin Rongqing in Diaobang Village, Seventh District of this county, are all considered to be moderately well-off and have been targeted by bandits. At around 10 PM the night before last, over a dozen bandits armed with sharp weapons broke into their homes. They first robbed the Yongxiang family of all cash, clothing, jewelry, and other items. Then, they proceeded to the Fengxiang and Rongqing families, ransacking their belongings. After about half an hour, they fled westward, shouting. The total losses for the three families are estimated to be over a thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Death of Anderson in Wuxi</h3>
<p>A German named Anderson came to Wuxi from Shanghai on the 10th of this month to enjoy the spring scenery. He stayed at the Taihu Villa on the top of Paotou Zhu Mountain. Unexpectedly, on the 17th, he suddenly fell unconscious and his face turned pale. The servants there suspected that he had committed suicide by taking poison. They immediately sent him to Puren Hospital for treatment and found three empty bottles of sedative pills and a pistol in his luggage. However, after Dr. Bu examined Anderson in the hospital, it did not appear to be a case of suicide by poisoning, but rather acute encephalitis. Dr. Bu did his best to treat him, but to no avail. By noon the day before yesterday, his temperature had risen to 107 degrees, his condition worsened, and his pulse became weak and rapid. He finally died at 7:30 PM. Anderson's wife and young son, who had come with him, were by his side, grieving at the sight. Anderson's mind never cleared until his death, so he left no last words. Dr. Bu and another German helped with the arrangements, purchasing a Chinese coffin and placing the body in the mortuary of the hospital. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, Bishop Dale of the Anglican Church led 30 to 40 Anglican Church members and Puren Hospital staff in conducting a funeral service for Anderson according to church regulations, reciting the Bible and praying. Then, Anderson's coffin was sent to the Anglican cemetery outside the South Gate for temporary burial. Anderson's wife has now taken a train to Shanghai to arrange for the transportation of Anderson's coffin back to Germany for burial.</p>
<h3>Death Due to Excessive Drinking</h3>
<p>Xiao Jin, the 27-year-old son of Lu Achuan, a villager from Zhang Anshang near Zhangcun Town in the Fifth District (Tianshang City), worked as a butcher in the Huijinshan butcher shop in the town. The day before yesterday, after finishing his work, he was returning home when he passed by the Longshejian nunnery. A certain family was brewing liquor at the nunnery. Xiao Jin went into the nunnery, and Gao Shungen, who knew Xiao Jin well, knew that he was very fond of this drink. He bet with him, ordering him to drink three and a half bowls of liquor. Xiao Jin gladly accepted the challenge and drank it all. Soon after, he returned home. Unexpectedly, the alcohol took effect and caused his death.</p>
<h3>Three Notorious Bandits from Changshu Handed Over to Xiaoxian County</h3>
<p>Hao Zi and other notorious bandits from Xiaoxian County in this province had committed numerous crimes in the county, looting the entire county last year and causing losses of over 200,000 yuan. They had repeatedly evaded capture. Special Agent Zhu Wenrui and others were dispatched to track them down and arrived in Changshu the day before yesterday. They worked with the local detective team to arrest Hao Zi, Wang Xiaofa, Wang Jinming, and three others at the Southern Hostel outside the South Gate. These bandits had robbed rice shops and flower shops in Hejia City in this county in mid-last month, and shot and killed the shop owner, Zhang Shenqing. Therefore, after their arrest, the county government planned to prosecute them in Changshu. However, the Xiaoxian authorities stated that Hao and others had committed many crimes in the county and that they needed to recover firearms and various stolen goods, so they telegraphed to earnestly request their extradition to Xiaoxian County. The county government immediately approved the extradition of Hao Zi and Wang Jinming, but Wang Xiaofa was not extradited because he was involved in a bloody case in Changshu. Today, the 21st, several officers from the Public Security Bureau's artillery squad, along with Xiaoxian County detectives, boarded a ship to escort them to Xiaoxian.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Executed by Firing Squad in Donglai Town</h3>
<p>Donglai Town, Shazhou City, was looted by 50 to 60 pirates on December 27th of last year. The firearms of the anti-smuggling squad's headquarters were also seized. The losses amounted to 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. After the incident, the county detective team leader, Zhu Shunqing, arrested eight bandits in Pudong, Liuhe, and other places. All of them were the main perpetrators of this case. After repeated interrogations by the county government, the bandits confessed to the truth and were sentenced accordingly. Among them, Lu Youshan (44 years old) from Nantong, Tang Dianlin (27 years old), and Huang Yongchang (29 years old) from Rugao were deemed to be the most serious offenders. The provincial government was notified to execute them by firing squad. After the provincial government approved, the county was instructed to carry out the execution on the morning of the 21st. In the afternoon at 2 PM, the county dispatched police officers to bring the three bandits out and escort them to the execution ground outside the North Gate for execution.</p>
<h3>Six Bandits Executed by Firing Squad for Robbery and Kidnapping in Changzhou</h3>
<p>The home of Shi Huihui in Guan'an Township, Third District of Wu County, was previously robbed, and Shi's younger brother, Qihuo, was shot and killed by the thieves. The township security team went to pursue them, and investigator Wu Xifu was also shot and killed. Subsequently, the homes of Hu Shanyan and Liu Chanlin in Guanshan Township of the same district were robbed, and several people were injured. The county government strictly investigated the case and apprehended Yu Jinxi, a notorious bandit involved in the case. Chen Chunsheng and Liu Liansheng, also involved in the case, were arrested in Shanghai, Suzhou, and other places. In March of this year, the home of Jiang Changgen in Dongyan Village, Ninth District, was suddenly invaded by several kidnappers who abducted Changgen's daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Upon hearing this, the district police and security team pursued them and captured the kidnappers Lu Zichu, Hu Ming, and Li Ziming near Liushu Village. They were all brought to the county for interrogation. Magistrate Jiang determined that the two cases were serious and sentenced the six apprehended criminals to death. The provincial government approved the execution by telegram on the 21st. In the afternoon at 4 PM, police officers were dispatched to sign and bring the six criminals, including Yu Jinxi, to the scene to verify their identities. They were tied up and taken to the Fengweidun execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>

It is reported that Mr. Cai is currently drafting a report on Shanghai's financial situation and future reform plans, preparing to present it at the conference.</p>
<h3>Cross-Border Telephone Contract Expires Negotiations for Permanent Solution Underway</h3>
<p>The issue of telephones on roads built beyond the concession boundaries is related to China's sovereignty. Therefore, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, together with the Shanghai Municipal Government's Public Utilities Bureau, repeatedly negotiated with the Shanghai Telephone Company of the concession. As a result, a temporary contract was signed in Shanghai on April 19th of last year. However, this contract was temporary in nature, with a term of one year. Therefore, it expired on April 19th of this month. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau had declared to the telephone company one month ago that the contract was about to expire and discussed a permanent solution. However, the company delayed on various pretexts. Therefore, although the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau have drafted principles on their own for a permanent solution, they have not formally proceeded. It is reported that our side will resolutely continue negotiations with the telephone company in the coming days. Before a permanent solution is formally negotiated, this temporary contract will remain valid.</p>
<h3>Actively Promoting the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>Wei Ke's Speech at the YMCA The Shanghai YMCA at Baxianqiao has been holding New Life Movement speeches every Sunday since April 22nd. There are a total of four lectures, with Wei Ke, Yang Weiyu, Liu Zhanen, Jiang Wenyu, and others invited to speak. The first lecture was held yesterday afternoon at 4 PM in the YMCA auditorium.

The content first described the origin of the New Life Movement, introduced Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speeches on the New Life Movement, and then analyzed the diseases of the Chinese people, including (1) a lack of social morality, (2) physical weakness, the reasons for which are (A) a lack of hygiene, (B) early marriage, (C) multiple births, (D) a lack of attention to exercise, (E) a lack of legitimate entertainment, (3) a lack of a cooperative spirit and organizational ability, (4) a lack of a courageous and active spirit. These four major diseases have made the national crisis increasingly urgent. To save this crisis, it is necessary to reform people's lives, popularize education, and improve culture, which are prerequisites for transforming life.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Addition of Riverboats Postponed Due to Sluggish Business on Yangtze River Line and Limited Funds Ocean Liners Nearing Completion Decision Made to Send Personnel to England for Inspection</h3>
<p>The case of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, a state-run enterprise, borrowing from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to build river and ocean liners. The four ocean liners are being built in England and are expected to be completed this year. The first two ships are expected to be completed by the end of September and will sail to China. The company will send personnel to England for inspection. The cost of building the two riverboats at the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department has already been determined. According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the construction of the riverboats has been postponed. The reasons are: (1) Business on the Yangtze River line is quite sluggish, and the company has a total of fourteen ships on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which are sufficient for dispatch. (2) The total amount of the loan is 400,000 pounds. Due to the construction costs exceeding the budget, the riverboats have been affected. Also, at a time when funds are stretched, construction is being postponed due to the above two points. A decision will be made in the future based on the needs of the business and the availability of funds.</p>
<h3>Merger of Wire and Wireless Telecommunications to be Implemented on May 1st, Additional Chief Engineer's Office Established with Four Sections Yesterday a Meeting Was Held to Discuss Detailed Procedures</h3>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that the merger of wired and wireless telecommunications has been ordered by the Ministry of Communications and will be implemented on May 1st. The name will remain the Telegraph Bureau. One additional engineer will be added. There will be four sections, including the administrative section. Yesterday afternoon, the directors of wired and wireless telecommunications held a meeting to discuss detailed procedures. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Merger Implementation Methods</h3>
<p>Whether it concerns the merger of wired and wireless communications, except for</p>
<p>a portion of the Receiving and Dispatching Department, which</p>
<p>has already been implemented, the overall merger plan has been drafted by the Ministry of Communications, and orders have been issued to both parties for notification. Representatives from the Telegraph Bureau and the Wireless Radio Station, after receiving the order, held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Responsible personnel from both sides, such as Wu Baofeng, Director of the Telegraph Bureau, and Yu Ruxin, Chief Engineer of the Wireless Radio Station, discussed various detailed rules related to telegraph services, and the meeting adjourned around 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Ministry Order Confirms Name</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has</p>
<p>carefully considered</p>
<p>the name after the merger. Since both wired and wireless telegraphs are telegraph transmission agencies, the most appropriate name would be the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, it has been decided to retain this name. The new bureau's address will remain within the original Telegraph Bureau on Fourth Malu Road. The original Wireless Radio General Station on MinGuo Road will be converted into a telegraph Receiving and Dispatching Department.</p>
<h3>Internal Organizational Changes</h3>
<p>After the merger, in addition to appointing a director</p>
<p>to be responsible for handling administrative</p>
<p>matters, a chief engineer will also be added to assist the director in handling bureau affairs. At the same time, the original organization of the bureau will be changed, establishing four sections: Telegraph Operations, Business, General Affairs, and Engineering. A chief accountant will also be appointed. All telegraph operators, business clerks, and technicians will continue to work as usual, but will be integrated into one office for convenience.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Key Personnel</h3>
<p>The complete list of newly appointed personnel,</p>
<p>according to what our East China News Agency</p>
<p>reporter has learned, is as follows: Wu Baofeng will remain the Director. Yu Ruxin, the Chief Engineer of the Wireless Radio Station, will be appointed as the Chief Engineer. Hua Shijian, the original Business Manager, will be transferred to serve as the Head of the Telegraph Operations Section. Xu Le, the Wireless Radio Station's Telegraph Operations Director, will be transferred to serve as the Head of the Business Section. Chen Wende will be appointed as the Head of the General Affairs Section. The position of Head of the Engineering Section will be temporarily held concurrently by the Chief Engineer until the Ministry of Communications assigns someone. Liu Chunfu, appointed by the Ministry, will serve as the Chief Accountant.</p>
<h3>Implementation on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>According to Hua</p>
<p>Shijian, Head of the Telegraph Operations Section, who spoke to the East China News Agency</p>
<p>reporter yesterday, the name and organization are all stipulated by order of the Ministry of Communications. They have been following the order in recent days and have scheduled the implementation to begin on the first day of next month. After the merger, all wired and wireless employees will continue to perform their duties as usual.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders Chief Customs Inspector to</h3>
<h3>Explain the Meaning of "Vessels"</h3>
<p>The Chief Customs Inspector previously stated that the scope of the term "vessels" as stipulated in the Maritime Law was unclear, and specially requested the Ministry of Finance to provide a clear explanation. The Ministry of Finance, upon receiving the request, forwarded it to the Ministry of Communications for consultation. The Ministry of Finance has now obtained the explanatory document from the Ministry of Communications and instructed the Chief Customs Inspector to be informed. Our newspaper reporter learned yesterday that the original order stated: "Upon investigation, the term 'vessels' mentioned in Article 1 of the Maritime Law refers to ships navigating at sea and those navigating on waters connected to the sea and capable of accommodating seagoing vessels." "Furthermore, Article 2 states that 'The following vessels are not subject to the provisions of this Law, except in cases of collision: 1. Vessels with a gross tonnage of less than twenty tons or a capacity of less than two hundred dan.' Based on this interpretation, vessels with a capacity of two hundred dan or more, navigating at sea or on waters connected to the sea as defined in Article 1 of the Law, are 'vessels' as defined by the Maritime Law." You are hereby informed. This order is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>County Government Meeting to Re-divide Townships</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, upon receiving orders to reorganize autonomous regions and instructing immediate compliance with regulations for re-division and merger, has determined that the divisions of each district are in accordance with the regulations of the provincial government and will not be re-divided or merged. The re-division of townships within each district must be carried out in accordance with the regulation of five hundred to one thousand households. Therefore, the county government convened a meeting of district chiefs yesterday to determine the number of townships in each district in detail for implementation. After detailed discussions among the district chiefs, it was resolved to set the maximum standard for the number of townships to be re-divided and merged in each district as follows: District 1: 10 townships, District 2: 13 townships, District 3: 6 townships, District 4: 9 townships, District 5: 5 townships, District 6: 5 townships, totaling 48 townships.</p>
<h3>Encouraging the Public to Plant Trees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government believes that planting trees can both increase production and regulate the climate, and embellish the scenery. The county has many barren graves, which not only fail to utilize the land but also detract from the scenery. Therefore, it is necessary to earnestly persuade the owners of the graves to utilize the cemetery grounds to plant saplings extensively, in order to increase production and develop the land. Yesterday, a proclamation was specifically issued stating that wherever there are gaps in the cemetery grounds, saplings must be widely planted during this Spring Festival. All levels of autonomous personnel should especially lead by example, starting with planting, to promote this initiative.</p>
<h3>Initial Construction Plan for Double-Tracking</h3>
<p>Adding Passing Tracks at Both Ends First</p>
<p>Negotiations Underway to Complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Line</p>
<p>The laying of double tracks on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, following concrete planning by the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, has already been approved by the Ministry of Railways. However, due to financial considerations, the addition of double-track passing tracks at both ends of the Beijing-Shanghai line will be the initial construction plan. The bureau is also currently in negotiations to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line. Details of the situation are provided below:</p>
<h3>Initial Double-Tracking Plan</h3>
<p>Recognizing that passenger and freight transport on the Beijing-Shanghai</p>
<p>line is becoming increasingly</p>
<p>busy, the two railway administrations have long discussed</p>
<p>laying double tracks. After formulating a concrete plan, it has already been submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. However, due to the financial inability to construct the entire line simultaneously, it has now been decided to first add double-track passing tracks at Nanxiang Station in Shanghai, Hepingmen Station in Beijing, and Qiaotouzhen, as the first phase of construction for laying double tracks. The bureau has already put the entire project out to tender, so construction can begin in the near future.</p>
<h3>Completing the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line</h3>
<p>Completing the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo</p>
<p>line is actually the most</p>
<p>important plan for the development of the two</p>
<p>railways.</p>
<p>Therefore, the two railway administrations, determined to realize the plan, although feeling the difficulty of raising funds, are not slacking off. Since the completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, funded by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, is almost completed and will begin construction in July this year. The two railway administrations are even more eager to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line. Therefore, the bureau is currently in negotiations with the Zhejiang provincial authorities in the hope of completing it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Poland to Celebrate National Day on the Third of Next Month</h3>
<p>Reception for All Sectors at the French Club</p>
<p>The third of next month is Poland's National Day. Guo Leixinisiqi, Counselor of the Polish Embassy in China and Acting Consul-General, has scheduled a celebration at 11:30 AM on that day at the French Club, and will host guests from all sectors, both Chinese and foreign.

<h3>People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen, Chen Ce, Gan Naiguang, and others took the night express train to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>The Impending Construction of the Tomb of Unknown Heroes</h3>
<p>The address and funds are all prepared.</p>
<p>The design of the tomb passage is finalized and construction will begin immediately.</p>
<p>Our paper reports, during the January 28th Shanghai Battle, our loyal and brave soldiers fought for the country, regardless of their lives, preserving the supreme glory of the nation. However, the remains of the national martyrs have not yet been properly buried. Mounds of yellow earth, barren graves, withered grass and slanting sunlight, present a scene of desolation, recalling the loyal souls, making one sigh. Previously, the military, government, and business sectors jointly organized the construction of the Tomb of Unknown Heroes, to permanently commemorate them, to comfort the souls of the heroes. Now, all procedures have been prepared, and construction will begin immediately. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Funds and Designs are Taking Shape</h3>
<p>Regarding the designs for the Tomb of Unknown Heroes,</p>
<p>the municipal government's construction</p>
<p>engineers have drafted two drawings.</p>
<p>One has a larger scale, requiring approximately</p>
<p>100,000 yuan, and the other has a slightly smaller scale, costing 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. The planning committee will review them within the next few days and make a decision. Regarding the funding, 70,000 yuan has already been raised. Once the designs are finalized, construction can begin. The shortfall is expected to be easily raised through donations. According to the planning committee, construction can begin in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>The Tomb Passage is Solemn and Tragic</h3>
<p>The decided tomb site of over 30</p>
<p>mu has been donated by</p>
<p>all sectors of Baoshan in Miaoxingzhen</p>
<p>Land plot, sufficient for use. The tomb site</p>
<p>is sword-shaped, with a stone</p>
<p>tomb hall at the end. There are stone steps in the memorial tower,</p>
<p>Entering through the door, it is particularly tragic. The surroundings of the tomb</p>
<p>are planted with flowers and trees. Various relics from the Shanghai Battle are displayed in the tomb hall,</p>
<p>so that the wounds left by the violent sun will forever remain in the minds of future generations,</p>
<p>so that they know what to be vigilant about, in order to seek a way to national salvation and survival. A boulevard is built outside the tomb, connecting Dachang in the west and Zhabei in the south, so that there will be no suffering from detours in the future when paying respects to the heroic spirits.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Reports Huge Amount of Smuggled Sugar Explaining Merchants' Tax Evasion Schemes Annual Loss of 1.8 Million Customs Gold Units</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that in recent years, organized smuggling rings have been importing sugar into China "through the back door" in such large quantities that it is almost unbelievable. Therefore, sugar importers are greatly alarmed. The quantity of sugar smuggled last year is proven to be 134,000 tons, but the actual number is feared to be not far from 200,000 tons. Consider that the total amount imported through customs from Java and Cuba is only 190,000 tons, then the extent of smuggling can be imagined. Sugar merchants claim that sugar has now become a luxury item for the public, and its trade is gradually becoming corrupt. This is largely due to the high tariffs. The current tariff rate is almost 150% of the market price (including tariffs, insurance, and freight). Because tariffs are based on extreme degrees, although global sugar prices are falling, the tariff rate remains the same. Although customs is strict in preventing smuggling, it is not difficult to unload goods from sand ships on the coast. If a ship carries 2,000 bags of sugar, the profit is about 5,000 yuan. Therefore, sand ship smugglers believe that if they are caught by customs once and lose 20,000 yuan, they can recover their losses by smuggling four times. Some smuggled goods come from Hong Kong, because sugar can be imported into Hong Kong duty-free. Some come from Taiwan, because Taiwan is a very convenient base for shipping goods to the Chinese coast. Occasionally, some come from the three northeastern provinces. Taiwan is a sugar-producing area, and the import of sugar has been increasing in recent years, which can be imagined how rampant smuggling is. A survey of sugar exports from various places through customs and imports into China through customs in 1933 is quite interesting. In 1933, the tonnage of sugar exported through customs (excluding syrup, cube sugar, and rock sugar) was approximately as follows:</p>
<p>From Java to China 97,400</p>
<p>From Java to Taiwan 20,000 From Java to Hong Kong 191,000 From Cuba to Hong Kong 11,000 From Java and Cuba</p>
<p>Total Shipped to China as Final Destination 320,000</p>
<p>In 1933, the amount of sugar imported through customs (excluding syrup, cube sugar, and rock sugar, according to the customs monthly trade report) was as follows in piculs:</p>
<p>Imports from Java 2,205,365 Imports from Taiwan 56,393 Imports from Hong Kong 943,195 Total piculs 3,204,953 Or in tons 190,000</p>
<p>From the above table, the difference between the amount of sugar imported into China from Java and Cuba and the amount imported through Chinese customs is approximately 130,000 tons. This is the amount of sugar smuggled into China in 1933, resulting in a loss of approximately 12 million customs gold units in customs revenue. Taiwan is included in the table because all the sugar shipped from Java to Taiwan is smuggled into China. Hong Kong is only a distribution center. With the exception of a very small amount of sugar consumed locally in Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou Bay, the rest is transshipped to China. Furthermore, at the beginning of the year, Hong Kong's sugar reserves were about 4,000 tons more than at the end of the year. This amount must also have been smuggled into China this year. The above table does not include sugar shipped from Japan to China, but it is estimated that the number must far exceed the total import of approximately 59,000 tons reported in the customs monthly trade report. Also, in 1933, the total amount of sugar shipped from Java to Japan was 143,000 tons. Therefore, including the approximately 134,000 tons of sugar smuggled into China via Hong Kong and Taiwan, the total amount of sugar smuggled into China is approximately 200,000 tons, resulting in a loss of 1.8 million customs gold units in customs revenue. Local sugar importers in this city, recognizing this situation, have recently written to the National Government, detailing everything, and requesting that sugar tariffs be revised to prevent the continued increase in smuggling.</p>

<h3>Disbanding Righteous Army, Begging Their Way to Xinjiang Ten Thousand Miles on Foot to Hami Residents are Diverse and the Turkish Ethnic Group is Very Powerful Cultural Level is Low and They Are Very Ignorant of the National Situation</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that during the Songhu Battle, the Shanghai Student Righteous Army, commanded by the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army, was reorganized into the Shanghai Student Righteous Army Northeast Volunteer Corps after the agreement and the 19th Route Army was ordered to go to Fujian to suppress bandits. Li Xiangheng was elected as the corps commander, and the Ministry of Military Affairs allocated a special train to go north to participate in frontline work. It was assigned to Zhu Qinglan, Weng Zhaoyuan, and other departments for a long time. Later, it was disbanded due to the Tanggu Agreement. The corps commander Li Xiangheng, considering that our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, often fails to connect with the border provinces, resulting in foreign immigrants invading them. Therefore, he led seven people from Beiping to Xinjiang on foot, covering a journey of four and a half months, and arrived in Hami, Xinjiang. Fan Junye, who recently returned east from Xinjiang, has arrived in Shanghai, and according to him, the experience of going to Xinjiang is very detailed. A special record is made as follows:</p>
<h3>Forming a Begging Group</h3>
<p>According to what Fan Jun told the Xin Xin News Agency reporter yesterday, after our corps (Northeast Volunteer Corps) disbanded, we realized that Li had the intention of going to Xinjiang and insisted on going with him. Therefore, seven people voluntarily organized a begging group, because we had no funds and wanted to reach the distant Xinjiang. We decided that we could not reach our destination without begging. Therefore, in April last year, we took the Ping-Sui Railway train (free of charge) from Beiping to Baotou, and walked from Baotou to Hami, Xinjiang, covering a journey of more than 130 days and a distance of approximately 12,000 li. The transportation to Ningxia and Gansu is still convenient. From Jiayuguan to Hami, it is all open space and desert, and the roads are vaguely recognizable. If you go into a fork in the road, there are many dangers.</p>
<h3>Sparse Population</h3>
<p>According to the local people around Jiayuguan, it takes</p>
<p>eleven stations to reach Hami from here, about</p>
<p>2,000 li away. The road is full of desert and open space with no signs of human habitation. During the Guangxu years of the late Qing Dynasty, when officials were sent to Xinjiang to inspect, they passed through here. It has been more than 30 years since anyone has traveled this road to Hami. Hearing this, we raised enough food and proceeded slowly. At that time, it was the middle of July, and the weather was unusually hot. It was difficult to walk during the day, and we had to find a cave or mountain cave to sit and lie in. We dared to move only when the sun went down. We encountered thieves twice on the way, but there was nothing to</p>
<p>rob, so we simply bowed our heads and remained calm.</p>
<h3>Blocked National Conditions</h3>
<p>When we arrived in Hami, the local people</p>
<p>were very surprised. Soon, a prince suddenly arrived,</p>
<p>kneeling down and saying that the heavenly court officials had come here and had been neglectful in welcoming them, and asked in detail about the recent situation of the heavenly court. Seeing this, we felt very pity and immediately explained to them and told them about the recent national situation, but they were all ignorant of it. They were surprised and asked why the chairman of the national government was surnamed Lin, and what the military commission was, but only knew that the emperor of the heavenly court was surnamed Jiang (because Jiang once served as the chairman of the national government). They also said that it was fortunate that the heavenly court had sent high officials to come here, and our suffering could be alleviated, because the troops there were very barbaric and undisciplined, and the people were often disturbed and could not bear it. They urgently hoped that the central government would provide them with relief. Also, the news from all sides there was only spread by wall newspapers or oral news. Newspapers from major ports such as Beijing and Shanghai are never seen for more than a year.</p>
<h3>Power of the Righteous Army</h3>
<p>The most common language spoken there is</p>
<p>Turkish, followed by the Beijing dialect. There are also</p>
<p>local languages (local dialects) and dialects from various places, or descendants of people from the southeastern provinces who grew up there. However, the pronunciation has changed a lot, making it difficult to understand. The Turkish people account for the majority there. In addition to the formal troops raised by Sheng Shicai and others, there are also the Righteous Army of Li Du, totaling about 9,000 people, who are all called heavenly soldiers. It is learned that the defeat of Ma Zhongying's troops was largely due to the help of the Righteous Army.</p>
<h3>Abundant Special Products</h3>
<p>The province's special products, such as wool, livestock, gold and</p>
<p>silver mines, coal mines, etc., are produced in abundance. As for</p>
<p>planting, there are also many products, such as beans, wheat, melons, and fruits. Oil pools (gasoline) are a specialty of the area, like the inexhaustible sources of the Zigong wells. If our people can develop towards them, it will be better than the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After speaking, the reporter asked him if he would go again. He replied that this visit was purely to tell the comrades of the former volunteer corps so that those who are aspiring can continue to go. He plans to return to Xinjiang and Hami in about three or four months.</p>
<h3>Chicago Exposition Exhibits Subject to Taxation The Organizing Committee Received a Notification from the Ministry of Industry Yesterday</h3>
<p>It has been decided that the various exhibits from our country participating in the Chicago Exposition will be shipped from Shanghai on May 1st. The Organizing Committee for the Chicago Exposition received a notification from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, forwarded from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had received an official letter No. 2722 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the report from the Consul General in Chicago, the representative of the Organizing Committee, Zhang Xianglin, recently came to Chicago from New York and visited the Expo authorities. According to the Expo authorities, all exhibits this year will be subject to taxation, with ordinary commodities taxed at 12.5%, restaurants at 17.5%, souvenirs at 20%, and jade towers and theaters at 25%. After repeated consultations, the Expo authorities only agreed to reduce the tax on jade towers to 15%. This is hereby notified in addition to the reply.</p>
<h3>Central People's Movement Committee Orders Special Protection of Industry and Commerce to Make Efforts to Increase Production and Enrich People's Livelihoods Labor and Capital Must Also Recognize That They Are Closely Related</h3>
<p>The Central People's Movement Guidance Committee believes that in this time of national crisis, it is necessary to protect industry and commerce in order to increase production and enrich the national power. Yesterday, it sent a telegram to the city party headquarters and forwarded it to various industrial and commercial organizations, stating that in this time of national crisis, the whole country must share the worries and dangers and seek to enrich the national power. Our country's budding industry and commerce should be especially protected so that they can make efforts to increase production and enrich people's livelihoods. In this extraordinary time, both labor and capital must recognize that they are closely related to the great interests of the entire country and strive to avoid mistreating workers, reducing their livelihoods, and avoid situations such as strikes and slowdowns, so as not to harm social order and destroy the related and common opportunities for their lives. The local party headquarters should provide practical guidance and protection in peacetime. In the event that the above-mentioned situations occur, they should immediately work with the competent authorities to strictly stop them. Workers who cause labor unrest, if they are organized into a trade union, can be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Article 37, paragraph 3 of the Trade Union Law for the benefit of the nation and the state, so that the unrest can be quickly quelled. All levels of party headquarters and industrial and commercial organizations must achieve a deep mutual understanding in peacetime and plan methods for coordinated progress so as not to easily cause incidents and destroy the national pulse. This is extremely important. Central People's Movement Guidance Committee</p>

<h3>Yu Xuezhong Asks for Aid for Disaster Victims in Hebei Province Telegram Asking the Relief Federation to Continue to Provide Relief The Relief Federation Telegraphs Back That It Cannot Fulfill the Request</h3>
<p>Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government and Chairman of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, said that many people in the province have suffered from the Yellow River flood since last year. It is now early spring, and there is a shortage of food. The central government's investigation and relief office has been ordered to close down. The only hope for the disaster victims is assistance from all parties. He telegraphed various charitable organizations and the Yellow River Flood Relief United Federation to raise funds and continue to provide relief. After receiving the telegram, the Relief Federation telegraphed back yesterday that it could not provide assistance. The two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong's Telegram</h3>
<p>To the charitable organizations in Renji Tang, Yunnan Road, and the Yellow River Flood Relief United Federation: After the Yellow River broke its banks, your federation has distributed food and funds many times, saving countless lives. It is now early spring, and the wheat harvest is still far away. During this food shortage, spring relief should continue to be carried out to avoid displacement. The central government's investigation and relief office has been ordered to close down. Although the province has made every effort to raise funds, the disaster area is vast, and it is difficult to provide universal relief. The only hope for the disaster victims is enthusiastic assistance from all parties. I have always admired your federation's concern for the people. I beg you to generously show your kindness and continue to provide relief. I cannot express my gratitude enough.</p>
<h3>Relief Federation's Reply</h3>
<p>To Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Yellow River Flood Relief Committee in Tianjin: I have respectfully received your telegram. Our federation has been advertising and soliciting spring relief funds for more than two months, but no one has responded. Our voices are hoarse and we are deeply anxious, but unfortunately, we cannot fulfill your request. We apologize. We are sending this telegram in reply. I hope you will understand.</p>

<h3>Rental Disputes</h3>
<p>Ninkang Li Survey of Market Prices, Guowen News Agency reports: Ninkang Li, located on North Zhejiang Road, consists of old houses built over twenty years ago. Previously, the landlord Li Dafu, through his representative lawyer, issued a notice to uniformly increase rent by 15%, and retroactively collect 180 yuan per single building and over 480 yuan per double building, starting from December of the nineteenth year. This sparked unanimous opposition from the tenants in the area, who requested the Municipal Government to refer the matter to the Rental Dispute Committee for review. Commissioner Chen Lengseng was dispatched to the area for an on-site investigation, which revealed that the rental prices in Ninkang Li were already higher than those in neighboring areas, making the rent increase completely unjustified. Now, the landlord, without awaiting municipal government mediation, has abruptly requested the court to issue an enforcement order. The tenants in the area, upon receiving the order, are filled with anger and panic. They held a meeting last night, unanimously opposing the order and planning to file an objection to the execution according to the law.</p>
<p>Zhenxiang Li Tenants' Proposal: Tenants of Zhenxiang Li on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, regarding the landlord Wang Zhenxiang's collection of repair fees, held a meeting at 2 PM yesterday at the Tenth Branch of the Rent Reduction Association. Dozens of tenants attended, with Huang Songshan as chairman. Wan Shenji reported that the landlord, under the pretext of repairs after the January 28th Incident, had increased the repair fee by five yuan per building. The Standing Committee members of the Tenth Rent Reduction Branch, Lu Chunshan and Ren Ganquan, had mediated, but the landlord's attitude was firm, and after repeated negotiations, they only agreed to reduce the rent by half a yuan per room, and threatened demolition. They asked the attendees to discuss how to deal with the situation. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Notify all tenants to stop paying the repair fee; (2) If the landlord refuses to accept rent without the repair fee, the rent can be deposited in a bank; (3) Submit the facts of the landlord's oppression to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and various organizations for assistance; (4) Hire lawyer Wu Qilun as legal counsel; (5) Actively organize a branch of the rent reduction movement to facilitate progress, and report its establishment to the Zhabei District Association immediately; (6) Expenses will be shared by all tenants. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Xicheng Li Opposes Harsh Contracts: Tenants of Xicheng Li on Malong Road in the French Concession, in opposition to the landlord's enforcement of harsh contracts, had previously reported to the press. It is now learned that the tenants, to prevent landlord oppression, issued a special notice to all tenants in the area yesterday, which reads: Notice regarding the case of the landlord forcing the signing of illegal and harsh contracts, in which the undersigned has acted as mediator. However, the landlord has shown no sincerity, and has not agreed to a single clause proposed by this association. Therefore, the mediation has failed. It has been resolved by the association's interim executive committee to continue negotiations reasonably and actively, in accordance with the resolutions of the general assembly, to achieve the goal of cancellation.</p>
<p>Please note the following matters and the association's negotiation methods: (1) The association has hired barrister Wu Kaisheng as legal counsel. In addition to rejecting the over seventy letters sent to tenants by the landlord's representative lawyer, 　Zhen Ming, he will be responsible for legally protecting the legal interests of all tenants in the area. (2) All illegal contracts should not be signed. (3) The association has submitted the facts of the landlord's oppression to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and other agencies, requesting their intervention. (4) Members who have not yet filled out the membership application form should do so to compile a roster and elect formal executives on a regular basis. (5) The association's finances are strained. The membership fee of one yuan and the classified membership dues are currently being collected by the executives. Please pay immediately to cover expenses. Those who make special donations will be praised by the association at the general assembly. Please take note of the above notices.</p>

<h3>Special District Rickshaw Industry to Convene Emergency Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Due to the poor condition of rickshaws and equipment in the special district, the Public Concession's Public Works Department decided to recall 2,000 licenses annually and seek new merchants to take over the business, to be implemented starting July 1st of this year. The rickshaw merchants in the special district, for the sake of saving the rickshaw pullers, have held several meetings to discuss relief measures, such as establishing new villages, hospitals, and schools for rickshaw pullers. The special district industry will hold an emergency members' representative meeting at the clubhouse on Lloyd Road at 2 PM today, and has appointed Gu Songmao, Yin Zhiling, Liang Ruiting, and others as the presidium to discuss improvement and relief measures, and the direction of action.

<h3>Managers of Ice Factories Held Meeting Yesterday to Rectify Industry Rules; Concentrating Capital to Maintain Business; Petitioning Party and Government Authorities to Clarify Misunderstandings</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that representatives of ice factory managers Gu Fuxiang, Qian Acai, Hu Huiqing, etc., regarding recent reports that ice vendors Qiu Haitao, Wang Fengshan, Tang Abing, etc., had opposed factory managers and organized the Xiecheng Company, colluding with the Japanese-owned Dongfang Machinery Ice Factory to monopolize the market and hinder the livelihood of vendors, and petitioned Party and government agencies to find ways to stop it, which contained many misunderstandings,</p>
<p>held a meeting at 2 PM yesterday at the Sixth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Association in the Sanguantang on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession to discuss countermeasures. Gu Fuxiang first explained that the organization of the Xiecheng Company was entirely funded by Chinese capital and had no Japanese involvement, and that the Dongfang Ice Factory had no relationship with Xiecheng. However, ice factory managers, in view of the recent price drops in machine-made ice and the difficulty in protecting their capital, formed a company to rectify the industry, so that both managers and vendors would benefit in the future and avoid long-term decline. Unexpectedly, the vendors, due to our industry's rectification of industry rules, falsely claimed collusion with the Japanese and monopolization of the market, which is a misunderstanding. Now, in order to maintain business and protect our capital, we have decided not to stop progress due to the vendors' opposition, and should discuss countermeasures together. The industry representatives successively expressed their opinions, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the vendors' misunderstanding, the industry will publish statements in various newspapers to clarify the situation; (2) Organize a joint office for machine-made ice industry to continue discussing the rules for rectifying the industry's business, in order to avoid chaos; (3) Submit a separate document to Party and government agencies to clarify the vendors' misunderstanding in the petition, in order to avoid confusion; (4) Due to the vendors' personal attacks, alleging collusion with the Japanese, and intentionally damaging personal reputations, hire legal counsel to deal with the matter according to the law; (5) Regularly convene a general meeting of all industry representatives to discuss the progress plan for organizing a joint industry office, or organize an industry association according to the law to protect the interests of the industry. The above resolutions were unanimously approved by all attendees, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Machine-Made Ice Industry to Convene Industry Assembly Tomorrow; Reception for the Press This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The machine-made ice industry has recently found that Fu Zhijing is colluding with Japanese merchants to organize the Xiecheng Company, planning to exclusively sell the products of Chinese ice factories in the city, monopolize the market, and manipulate ice prices, and has petitioned Party and government agencies to stop it. In order to clarify the situation to all sectors, the industry has scheduled a reception for reporters from various newspapers at the Xinxin Restaurant on Guizhou Road at 2 PM today to publish the situation. Invitations have been sent, and a public announcement and declaration will be issued at that time. An industry representatives' assembly will be held tomorrow at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Relocates Floating Coffins in Gaoqiao District and Conducts General Cleaning of Teahouses</h3>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that Gaoqiao in Pudong is a district where residents gather. In order to promote public health, the Municipal Health Bureau has established a health office there to oversee health affairs in the district. The recent public health facilities in the district are described as follows:</p>
<h3>Relocating Floating Coffins</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the health office in Gaoqiao, it has spared no effort in promoting public health, such as epidemic prevention, school hygiene, factory hygiene, infant and maternal health, environmental health, and disease treatment, which has long been praised by local people. Director Zhang Wei recently pointed out that the district is becoming increasingly prosperous and is the location of a seaside bathing beach. Every spring and summer, Chinese and foreign tourists flock to the area. The prevalence of floating coffins is unsightly and unhygienic. He dispatched personnel to investigate the number of floating coffins, prepared a plan, and submitted it to the Health Bureau for approval. He will soon issue a notice in conjunction with the district's Public Security Bureau, setting a deadline for relocation in order to emphasize hygiene.</p>
<h3>Conducting Cleaning</h3>
<p>The district's teahouses have always been places where the public gathers to chat, but most do not pay attention to hygiene. In order to promote public health, the health office convened a meeting of the district's teahouse owners in January. Nineteen teahouses attended, and Dr. Zhang gave a speech on how washing face towels can transmit diseases such as scarlatina, syphilis, rashes, and ringworm, how drinking unboiled water can transmit cholera, typhoid, and dysentery, and how spitting everywhere can transmit tuberculosis, and their harmful effects, as well as methods for improvement, which were very detailed and concise, and moved the listeners. The office believes that the environment of the teahouses is too dirty and unsanitary, so it has set a deadline for a general cleaning, as well as whitewashing the walls and purchasing spittoons. The teahouse owners, due to the office's publicity efforts and constant guidance, are able to understand the importance of all sanitary facilities, so they are able to comply with the above guidance. The office has recently prepared many health posters and hung them in various stores, giving them a new look, and sends people to the teahouses in rotation to give lectures on health knowledge, which are enthusiastically received.</p>

<h3>Four Districts Crack Down on Accumulated Thefts; Confiscate Handguns and Bullets</h3>
<p>At 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, Chinese and Western detectives from the Jing'an Temple police station, along with an informant named Yu Jiashou, reported to the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau that a theft gang led by Chen Guoyou was hiding at No. 18 Anxiangfang, Chang'an Road. District Chief Long immediately ordered Detective Team Leader Wang Shifu to dispatch Deputy Team Leader Zhang Yingpin, along with Li Guiqing, Miao Jinhai, and others, to go to the address with the Jing'an Temple police officers. They arrested Chen Guoyou at Anxiangfang and confiscated a six-inch Browning handgun (No. 623),</p>
<p>seven bullets, one magazine, one pair of gold earrings, five yuan in cash, and two pawn tickets, all of which were taken to the district. Zheng Zuhan, the district officer, interrogated Chen Guoyou, who confessed that he was 40 years old and from Gaoyou, admitting to accumulated thefts. He had stolen property from Li Shizhen's tobacco and paper store at No. 756 Chang'an Road, the Wang Yongxing family, and Huang Shoukang's Baosheng tobacco and paper store on Meiyuan Road, which had already been spent. His accomplices included Wang Xiaosanzi and a Mr. Liu. Yu Jiatao had already been arrested by the concession police, but the addresses of Wang and Liu were unknown. District Chief Zheng, fearing that the confession was untrue, ordered the original detectives to summon the victims to verify the facts, which proved to be true. As the thief was carrying a handgun, it was feared that there were other serious cases, so Chen Guoyou was ordered to be temporarily detained at the Zhabei Branch of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau. A document, along with the handgun, bullets, and stolen goods, was submitted to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Japanese Goods - Dumping Cement in China</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that, according to news from the cement industry in this city, Japanese cement has recently become very active in Shanghai. The method of import is very secretive, presumably carried to Shanghai by Japanese ships in continuous succession. Our cement industry, such as Qixin and other factories, have well-deserved reputations for their product research and excellent goods, but have been slightly affected by the dumping of cheap Japanese goods.</p>
<h3>Moudeli Music Store - Second Floor Wall Collapses - Shatters Skylight Glass - Fortunately No Pedestrians Injured</h3>
<p>The municipal houses along Nanjing Road from the ball field east to Jiangxi Road mostly belong to the Haroun Company. However, due to years of disrepair, the collapse of a wall caused injury during the heavy wind and rain last month. Although repairs were made afterwards, traffic there has been obstructed due to the construction and has not been restored to its original condition. Unexpectedly, at 9:30 AM yesterday morning, the exterior wall of the second floor of the Moudeli Music Store at No. 116 Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road, which belongs to the Haroun Company, suddenly collapsed with a loud crash, startling pedestrians who ran away in panic. Fortunately, the Moudeli Music Store had a glass skylight installed outside the door, so the falling wall bricks pressed on the skylight, only shattering five pieces of glass, without injuring pedestrians. A nearby constable caught sight of the incident and quickly reported it to the Central Police Station, which notified the fire department. Firefighters were dispatched to the scene to remove the remaining walls and sweep away the broken bricks. As a result, traffic there was blocked for about an hour. Afterwards, the police, fearing that there might be danger, set up a wooden fence in front of the store to prohibit pedestrian traffic, and ordered the Haroun Company to quickly send workers to repair the building.</p>
<h3>Ren Shuanglong Actually Accuses a Friend of Theft; Again Bribes the Police; Investigation Concludes; Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Ren Shuanglong from Hangzhou reported to the Yangshupu Police Station the day before yesterday that he was robbed of a wallet containing 53 yuan while passing through an empty lot on Linqing Road at 1 PM. He said that he clearly remembered the thief's appearance and clothing, and pointed out that his friend Yao Tianbao from Shaoxing was similar. It turned out that Yao had lent Ren 5 yuan last December. At noon that day, Ren's friend Wu Yougen's child had a full-month celebration, and a banquet was held at the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant on Huade Road. Ren and Yao both went to drink. After the banquet, Yao asked Ren to repay the debt, and they argued. A diner, Jiang from Danyang, mediated. Afterwards, they went to the empty lot, continued to argue, and ended up fighting. Ren repaid Yao two double coins to settle the matter. Ren was unwilling and accused Yao of theft, robbing him of the aforementioned property, in order to have Yao taste the flavor of prison. Unexpectedly, the police chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate, and it turned out to be completely fabricated. When questioned by Ren, Ren urgently gave 8 yuan to the Chinese detective No. 303 as a bribe,</p>
<p>to have him arrest Yao and explain the situation. The Chinese detective reported the situation to the police chief, who detained Ren. The next morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Public Works Department lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case and filed a public prosecution for false accusation and bribery. He then presented the bribe money for inspection. Wu Yougen, Yao Tianbao, and Jiang 　Kun 　testified about the situation at the time, questioning the defendant, whose confession was evasive. Presiding Judge Wu then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, scheduling a date for the pronouncement of judgment.</p>
<h3>Preposterous Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Elder Brother, Sister-in-Law, and Uncles All Sued</p>
<p>Even Two Dead People Listed as Defendants</p>
<p>丨Clause Error Said to Be Due to Not Reading the Complete Book of Laws丨</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the First Special District Court heard a case in the First Criminal Court that was quite amusing. It is recorded as follows: The plaintiff, Pan Shiqian, 32 years old, from Hang County, Zhejiang, currently residing at No. 5 Youyuli, Xinzha Road, in the Minqiu Elementary School, wrote his own complaint, accusing Pan Shixuan, Pan Yumin, Pan Shaoxuan, Pan Mingsun, Pan Fansun, Pan Yangshan, Pan Shuoan, and Pan Fu, a total of eight people, of abandonment, encroachment, and obstruction of freedom. Among the eight defendants, Pan Shixuan is his elder brother, Fu is his sister-in-law, and the rest are the plaintiff's uncles. Only Pan Shixuan was present in court yesterday. Judge Liu asked the plaintiff about the facts of the accusation, but the answers were not what was asked, and the speech was incoherent. In short, he said that his elder brother and uncles did not find him a job, did not distribute his mother's belongings, and sometimes beat him. The court asked him that Article 311 of the criminal law listed in the complaint was about abandoning elders. Now, those you are accusing are all your elders. How can this law be cited? The plaintiff replied that it was because the defendant refused to buy him the Complete Book of Laws. The court asked if he had a mental illness, and he replied that he might. The defendant testified that when their late mother abandoned them, there were no belongings left. He has been giving the plaintiff three and a half yuan every week and has not stopped. The plaintiff has accused Pan Yumin and Pan Mingsun, who have both been dead for many years, and it is ridiculous that they are listed as defendants today. My wife, Fu, was supposed to come to court today, but she was unable to appear due to illness. The court said that the plaintiff's accusation was obviously nonsense, and the case could have been concluded today, but because Fu was not present, it was ordered to change the date for further verification.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Cracked Down in Fuxing Teahouse, Guangdong Street; Thirteen Men and Women Punished Separately; Large Quantities of Gambling Equipment and Gambling Money Confiscated</h3>
<p>In the Fuxing Teahouse on Guangdong Street in the South City, Dong Laodong and Liu Yunshan from Yangzhou secretly set up a gambling den, sending many gamblers to entice ignorant men and women in the vicinity to gamble day and night. Dice, bamboo tiles, playing cards, and everything else were available. Dong and others profited by skimming, reaping great benefits. This was discovered by Detective Team Leader Shen Wenda of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who reported it to Team Leader Lu and District Chief Li of the Second District, who immediately dispatched detectives and police officers, all in disguise, to secretly go to the teahouse the night before. They arrested the gambling bosses Dong Laodong, gamblers Chen Yongsheng, Xu Aliang, Liu Yunshan, Wu Jinlin, Zhang Xiangzuo, Jiang Lide, Zhang Falang, Cai Changfu, Han Hexing, Xu Limou, and Wang Zhang, a total of thirteen men and women, and confiscated a large quantity of gambling equipment, which were all taken to the district along with the gambling money. Yesterday morning, after interrogating the criminals, they all confessed to gambling. District Chief Li fined the gambling bosses six yuan each and the rest three yuan each as a warning. The gambling equipment and gambling money were all confiscated.</p>
<h3>Gu Jiazhai Park: Russian Man Drowns in Lotus Pond, Likely Due to Drunkenness</h3>
<p>In the lotus pond of Gu Jiazhai Garden (i.e., French Park) at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Rue Luber in the French Concession, the body of a Western-dressed man was discovered floating in the water at around 7:00 AM yesterday. A Chinese constable on duty at the garden spotted the body and immediately reported it to the French police station. A Western police inspector dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and retrieve the body. The corpse was transported to the French Municipal Council's morgue on Route Tenant de la Tour for examination. An investigation into the cause of death has commenced, and efforts are underway to locate the deceased's family for identification and burial arrangements. It is rumored that the Russian man accidentally fell into the pond and drowned after becoming intoxicated.</p>
<h3>Longhua Temple Hosts Press Corps, Welcomes Visitors</h3>
<p>Longhua Temple has fallen into disrepair due to years of neglect. Recently, Wang Yiting and others initiated a project, recognizing the temple as a renowned ancient site in Shanghai. They recommended Master Xingkong as the abbot and arranged for a complete renovation. The construction project is extensive and requires over 100,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, the temple hosted a banquet for the press corps at Longhua Temple. More than thirty reporters from various newspapers attended. Master Xingkong presided over the event, explaining the process of taking over the temple and expressing hope that the press would support the concept of preserving ancient temples. Currently, troops are stationed in the temple. A request has been made to Mayor Wu to temporarily relocate the troops to allow for a complete renovation. Visitors to the temple may contribute donations as they wish to improve past undesirable practices. Recently, the peach blossoms at Longhua Temple have been in full bloom, attracting crowds of visitors. The temple welcomes groups from all walks of life to visit.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Temple Bathing the Buddha Festival: Vendors Ordered to Register</h3>
<p>The property of Jing'an Temple was ordered by the central government to be investigated and reorganized by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The municipal government's committee has handled the matter accordingly. However, rumors have spread that the temple's abbot, Zhiben, intends to sell or mortgage temple property privately. The municipal government has issued a public notice to prohibit such actions. However, the newly appointed abbot of the temple, Master Yuanying, has been unable to take over due to the authorities' lack of effective measures regarding the temple property issue. Each year, the Bathing the Buddha Festival generates substantial income for Jing'an Temple. Therefore, despite the temple being in a period of transition, Abbot Zhiben is still in charge of all matters for this year's Bathing the Buddha Festival. He has ordered all nearby vendors to register at the temple starting yesterday. It is said that this year's Bathing the Buddha Festival will be grander than in previous years.</p>

There were no belongings in the room, only three empty bottles of tranquilizers on the table, clearly indicating a suicide attempt by poisoning. He immediately reported the situation to the front desk, who called the police station. Officers quickly arrived and searched the room, but found no suicide note.

<h3>Two Young Men Suspected of Counter-Revolution | Convicted After Retrial</h3>
<p>Yan Azhang, 18 years old, from Ningbo, and Wang Zhiyuan, 21 years old, from Dongyang, Zhejiang, were both workers at the Qinxin Camel Wool Factory on Route Conty in the French Concession. In February of last year, they were arrested by the French police on suspicion of participating in a communist counter-revolutionary activity and were prosecuted by the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for endangering the Republic. After the trial, Yan and Wang were found not guilty. During the appeal period, they were held in the detention center. Yan and others, in the detention center, dared to gather other detainees to organize communist propaganda and counter-revolutionary activities, which was discovered by the guards who reported to the warden. Yan and Wang were transferred to the Third Branch of the High Court, where the prosecutor investigated and filed charges. After the trial, Yan and Wang were still found not guilty. Because the prosecutor did not accept the verdict, he appealed to the Supreme Court. After reviewing the entire case, the Supreme Court overturned the original verdict and sent the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. Judge Guo, along with judges Fan and Sun, repeatedly held hearings and completed the retrial. They determined that Yan and Wang were indeed guilty of spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda in the detention center. The verdict was announced on the afternoon of the previous day, sentencing Yan Azhang to seven years of imprisonment and Wang Zhiyuan to five years of imprisonment.

Xia Sanshunzi was sentenced to ten and a half years of imprisonment, Xu Xiaoheizi to seven years, and Wang Xiaoshunzi and Xu Ahong to five years each. Xia and the four others, dissatisfied with the verdict, jointly hired lawyer Bao Zhenhuang to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, denying that they had committed the robberies and stating the reasons why they had confessed to the police, requesting that the original verdict be overturned and their grievances redressed. Judge Zhao of the High Court summoned witnesses and interrogated Xia based on the evidence submitted, and lawyer Bao defended them. Yesterday morning, the court held a collegial panel and announced its verdict, overturning the original verdict and declaring Xia Sanshunzi and the four others not guilty. Lawyer Bao immediately requested that Xia and the others, who had been detained for a long time, be released on bail. However, lawyer Zhang Tianyin, representing the police station, opposed the bail, stating that the police station needed to consider whether to appeal.

<h3>The Crisis and Relief of China's Cotton Cloth Industry</h3>
<p>—Zhang Rongchu</p>
<p>3.  The collapse of the rural economy and weak purchasing power. Farmers are the main consumers of cotton cloth. Due to the economic aggression of imperialism, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Also, due to the continuous outflow of cash, the prices of agricultural products have plummeted. Under such circumstances, the purchasing power of farmers is becoming increasingly weak. Therefore, the production volume of China's cotton cloth industry, calculated by population, is far from sufficient. The current accumulation of inventory is actually due to the weakness of people's purchasing power.</p>
<p>4.  The vulgar psychology of Chinese people worshiping foreign goods. Although China's social economy is extremely panic-stricken, the vulgar psychology of Chinese people worshiping foreign goods is a common trend. The formation of this psychology is due to the temptation of material civilization, and the extravagance of Chinese people is also an important reason. People above the petty bourgeoisie are buying foreign goods, while lower-level farmers cannot afford to buy cotton cloth. How can the cotton cloth industry not be increasingly critical?</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned circumstances, the decline of China's cotton cloth industry has its inevitable facts. If we do not seek a fundamental solution, the state-run cotton cloth industry will inevitably be unbearable and on the verge of collapse. The following are my humble opinions on relief strategies:</p>
<p>1.  Reduce the tax rate on yarn and cotton. The raw materials for the manufacture of cotton cloth are cotton yarn and cotton. Since the collection of the unified tax on cotton yarn and the conversion to the all-unit system, each package must pay a tax of 6 taels, 2 mace, and 5 fen, or 8 taels and 3 mace, depending on the thickness of the yarn. In addition, it is necessary to bear the import tax on raw materials of 10 taels and 8 mace (because the quality of cotton in our country is relatively poor, it is inevitable to use foreign cotton). This huge tax rate is not found in other countries. Comparing it with the yarn and cotton in Japan, the same foreign cotton is used as raw material, and those sold domestically without export save customs duties and import duties of about 17 or 18 taels per package compared with manufacturers in our country. The export of finished yarn also bears less foreign cotton import tax of 10 taels, 7 or 8 mace per package than our country. If cotton is purchased domestically, transportation is hindered, and local needs often make merchants hesitate. Therefore, to revitalize the cotton cloth industry, reducing the tax rate on yarn and cotton is a necessary step.</p>
<p>2.  Implement industrial incentive policies. Recently, foreign textile factories have taken advantage of China's cheap labor and raw materials to avoid tariff barriers by setting up factories in China to compete with Chinese cotton cloth manufacturers. When the Treaty of Shimonoseki has not been abolished and the tariff agreement is valid, China is bound by unequal treaties and cannot refuse. However, the capital and technology of Chinese factories are difficult to compete with. In order to cultivate industry and stabilize people's livelihoods, the government must implement industrial incentive policies. Economically incentivize Chinese factories to prevent foreign merchants from finding excuses, and Chinese merchants can survive. Otherwise, cotton cloth factories in various places will be unbearable and completely eliminated, and foreign merchants will monopolize the market.</p>
<p>3.  Guide Chinese people to enjoy using domestic products. China's population is over 400 million. If everyone can embrace the determination to enjoy using domestic products, the prosperity of industry can be expected immediately. If we want to save the cotton cloth industry, we must create a habit of enjoying the use of domestic cotton cloth throughout the country. The government should give strong protection, and it is not difficult to survive in desperate situations.</p>
<p>The crisis of China's cotton cloth industry and the urgent relief are roughly as described above. Government officials should be aware of the urgency of the industrial crisis, quickly stabilize social order, improve the political organization, adopt the above-mentioned proposals, and the financial community should also support it, reduce the burden of interest, and enrich the use of capital, so that entrepreneurs can further plan for the comprehensiveness of equipment, technological progress, production improvement, strictly prohibit illegal competition among the same industry, take foreign countries as the goal, and seek the prosperity of business. Then, the revival of the cotton cloth industry can be expected.</p>
<h3>Reading Q&amp;A Reading "The Destiny of Tears and Smiles" (Second Continuation)</h3>
<p>The ideology expressed in "The Destiny of Tears and Smiles" is undoubtedly full of the keynote of the modern bourgeoisie. Throughout the book, not only is the love problem of Fan Jashu, which constitutes the backbone of the book, but also the "humble" civilian thoughts and the chivalrous behavior of "helping the weak and suppressing the strong" are all based on the perspective of the bourgeoisie. The characteristic of the Chinese bourgeoisie is that it embarked on the crisis of collapse from the beginning, showing extreme contradictions from the beginning, and exposing its own weakness from the beginning: it is not only unable to establish and enrich its own life, but also has a tendency to compromise with or even surrender to the enemy at all times. This characteristic, reflected in the practical problems of society, becomes the strange sound of "saving the country through science" and "saving the country through chanting scriptures" shouted at the same time as mentioned earlier, and reflected in "The Destiny of Tears and Smiles", it creates the reason for "The Destiny of Tears and Smiles" to wear a "supernatural" coat. If we mechanically recognize that "The Destiny of Tears and Smiles" is equal to "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" and "Legend of the River and Lake Heroes" because we saw miracles like "Exterminating Traitors in Mountain Temples" and chivalrous heroes like "Thirteenth Sister" in "The Destiny of Tears and Smiles", it is completely a product of feudal society, then that would be a big mistake. The reason why "The Destiny of Tears and Smiles" wears that "supernatural" coat is just to show the bourgeoisie's unmistakable "bumpkin" appearance. The bourgeoisie, in its own contradictions and on its way to collapse, has no choice but to retreat to the feudal ancient tombs to find a way out. At the same time, what we should also mention here is Mr. Zhang Henshui, the author of this book. From this book, we can see that the literary education he received was feudal, not modern bourgeois, so although he wanted to be a spokesperson for the bourgeoisie, he could only describe a shallow outline in the end, and could only use that "accidental" "supernatural" old needle and thread to weave this "Bagua coat". Since the bourgeoisie does not have the power to enrich its own social life, it cannot complete its literary tasks. The above situation, of course, cannot be blamed on Mr. Zhang Henshui, but is a common fate of bourgeois literati. Although Mr. Zhang Henshui is a genius and can imagine "The Destiny of Tears and Smiles" out of thin air (according to the author's preface), he is powerless to remedy the defects of his class itself. This point is not without benefit as an answer to those who say how good the depiction skills and structure of "The Destiny of Tears and Smiles" are. The ideology expressed in "The Destiny of Tears and Smiles" must first be the humble civilian thought of condescension. In this book, how Fan Jashu befriends Guan Shoufeng and falls in love with Shen Fengxi is a concrete manifestation of this thought. However, the emergence of this thought is due to the bourgeoisie's boredom with its own life on the one hand, and because they see their own crisis and think of easing the emotions of the oppressed with kindness on the other hand. Therefore, the civilian thought expressed through Fan Jashu cannot overflow beyond the motivation of condescending curiosity and pity, and it is impossible to recognize from the relationship of real life that civilians are direct supporters of social life. This phenomenon is very common in today's society. The rich gentry and landlords who lend money at high interest rates do not lose their qualifications to be great philanthropists. In the book, the scene of "Escape from the Devil's Cave" makes Fan Duanben also have to call Guan Shoufeng his brother. This, of course, brings this thought to the extreme, and at the same time, it more clearly points out that the civilians of the bourgeoisie are originally the heroes of the grass roots who can be loyal to them, and reach the tendency to worship heroism. Therefore, the civilian thought here is stained with some feudal colors.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we want to raise is the aesthetic love view expressed in The Destiny of Tears and Smiles. With Fan Jiashu as the center, the book unfolds a picture of multiple-angle love. Among the three different model women, He Lina, who is like a butterfly, and Guan Xiugu, who is like the Thirteenth Sister, are better than Shen Fengxi, who is in the dust, not to mention. On the one hand, it is the fault of his civilian thought, but the main thing is the unfolding of his appreciation of the love view. He loves Shen Fengxi because "she is a smart Jun Luo, although very poor, she has a kind of Qing Mei attitude, which can move people," so she has a feeling of pity for her. This view of love is exactly the typical love style of the son of the general bourgeoisie. The starting point of this view of love is to deny the personality of women, and to take money and status as weapons, and the inevitable phenomenon of the commodification of sex love with appreciation as the home.</p>
<p>In addition, from aestheticism to the supremacy of love. In order to cater to Fan Jiashu, He Lina abandoned her luxurious life and learned to be simple, and finally even left her family. At the same time, when Fan Jiashu and Shen Fengxi finally met in Berlin, she said, "In the past, it was said that when a woman lost her body to someone, whether willingly or forcibly, it was like a piece of white cloth dyed black, but now it is not said that as long as the husband truly loves his wife and the wife truly loves her husband, a little insult has nothing to do with each other's love." These are all extremely promoting the supremacy of love. This supremacy is also the highest target of bourgeois love. I think that this point, starting from the bourgeois point of view in consciousness, is a point with a relatively anti-feudal concept in the whole book. Finally, it is the revenge of the petty bourgeoisie. The author's emphasis on Guan Shoufeng and Guan Xiugu in The Destiny of Tears and Smiles is entirely to complete the scenes of "Exterminating Traitors in Mountain Temples" and the chivalrous behavior of gratitude and repayment. The departure of this revenge has been mentioned earlier, which is a political reflection of the petty bourgeoisie's dissatisfaction with the current society. This idea is considered the biggest stain in this book, and it is also the biggest flaw that makes this work ultimately become a legend novel.</p>
<p>That's all. Originally, it is not enough to be regarded as a critical article, but it is limited by the regulations of this column (each article cannot exceed three days), so I have to stop here. (End)</p>

<h3>The Sharp Progress of the Jiangsu Provincial Donghai Normal School</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Donghai Normal School, located in a remote area north of the Yangtze River, is in a poor and sparsely populated region. Its facilities have always been simple, and the students' level is lower than that of schools south of the Yangtze River. The students' thinking is also more complex than that of other schools. Since Mr. Cao Zhongquan became the principal last year, he has vigorously rectified and reformed the school. The hired faculty and staff are mostly well-known figures in the education field who work together to strictly train students' thoughts and actions, and strive to improve students' academic levels. Discipline, etiquette, cleanliness, and order are now all effectively implemented. In addition to living together, teachers and students also work together. The school grounds are swept by teachers and students led by their advisors after class. The agricultural field is divided by grade and leveled. It is said that in order to vigorously carry out life education, the agricultural field where teachers and students [illegible] has now been planted with fruit trees, grains, vegetables, and flowers, and new livestock pens have been built to facilitate animal husbandry. After class, each grade has organizations such as research associations, lecture associations, and editorial committees to study academic subjects and work on military training. Recently, during the provincial middle school military training inspection in Zhenjiang, the school's overall average score was fourth. In order to experiment with the popularization of [illegible] education, the school used the least amount of money to establish a free education experimental zone. Seventy to eighty percent of out-of-school children have now entered the school, and private schools have been eliminated informally. Regarding the school's facilities, Mr. Cao has newly built 20 Western-style dormitory buildings. Various books and equipment worth more than 2,000 yuan have been newly added. Various economic details are announced to the whole school every month to thoroughly implement economic openness. Mr. Cao has drafted a three-year plan to improve the whole school with more than 50,000 words, which has been published in the school's recently published school journal.</p>
<h3>The China Child Education Society's Japan Study Tour (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The salary situation of elementary school teachers in Kobe can be seen from the following table:</p>
<p>Regular Teachers of Higher Elementary School Regular Teachers of Ordinary Elementary School</p>
<p>Total Monthly Salary Average per person Total Monthly Salary Average per person</p>
<p>150260 60.35 1650 68.75</p>
<p>Specialized Regular Teachers Substitute Teachers</p>
<p>Total Monthly Salary Average per person Total Monthly Salary Average per person</p>
<p>14649 80.48 7895 56.00</p>
<p>The total monthly salary of all teachers is 135,682 yuan for men and 38,772 yuan for women, totaling 174,454 yuan. The average monthly salary per person is 65 yuan and 88 cents for men, and 60 yuan and 88 cents for women. The overall average is 78 yuan and 69 cents. The average monthly tuition fee for elementary school principals is 145 yuan and 14 cents. (The total number of teachers is 2,217, as mentioned earlier.)</p>
<p>There are 7 men and no women with monthly salaries above 180 yuan. There are 10 men and no women with monthly salaries above 165 yuan. There are 11 men and no women with monthly salaries above 145 yuan. There are 42 men and no women with monthly salaries above 135 yuan. There are 106 men and no women with monthly salaries above 125 yuan. There are 129 men with monthly salaries above 115 yuan. There are 159 men and 9 women with monthly salaries above 105 yuan. There are 138 men and 6 women with monthly salaries above 95 yuan. There are 138 men and 16 women with monthly salaries above 90 yuan. There are 145 men and 32 women with monthly salaries above 85 yuan. There are 95 men and 48 women with monthly salaries above 80 yuan. There are 150 men and 97 women with monthly salaries above 70 yuan. There are 226 men and 135 women with monthly salaries above 60 yuan. There are 222 men and 125 women with monthly salaries above 50 yuan. There are 19 men and 88 women with monthly salaries above 45 yuan. There are 6 men and 65 women with monthly salaries above 40 yuan. From this, we can see that there are fewer women serving as teachers than men, and their monthly salaries are also lower, due to qualification restrictions.</p>
<p>The report on the city's elementary school land and buildings has much to offer us for reference. All elementary school buildings are self-built, with a wide area, solid construction, attention to hygiene, and sports facilities. The statistics from the city government show that the total school land area is 107,074 tsubo (each tsubo is about 5 Chinese feet), the school building area is 72,394 tsubo, and the sports fields are (1) 52,127 tsubo outdoors, (2) 327 tsubo indoors, and (3) 6,661 tsubo on rooftops. The outdoor sports field averages 2.8 Chinese feet per child. Regarding the actual situation of the school buildings, I will report on one or two schools.</p>
<p>Kobe Municipal Night Schools are divided into ordinary courses and elective courses, both of which are remedial in nature. There are 16 ordinary night schools, with 102 male students and 74 female students. 49 males and 53 females are of school age. 53 males and 21 females are over school age. The occupations of each student during the day are 37 males and 45 females engaged in housework, 44 males and 19 females engaged in public service, and 21 males and 10 females in other occupations. There are 4 elective night schools, with 191 male students and 117 female students. 71 males and 64 females are of school age. 120 males and 53 females are over school age. The occupations of each student are 67 males and 71 females engaged in housework, 4 males and 9 females engaged in public service, and 140 males and 37 females in other occupations. From this, we can see that although Japan is known for its widespread education, some have no opportunity to attend school during the normal school-age years (6 to 12 years old). This is one thing worth noting. Also, all children in night school have jobs, which is the second thing that needs attention.</p>
<p>There are a total of 7 kindergartens in the city. The earliest is the Kobe Kindergarten, founded in Meiji 20. The latest is the Nishinada Kindergarten, established in Showa 3. The average childcare period is three years. There are a total of 36 classes in each school, with 544 male children and 529 female children, totaling 1,073. There are 44 nannies, averaging 24 kindergarten students per nanny. Their facilities are particularly impressive. The nursery room occupies 423 tsubo (each tsubo is about 5 Chinese feet), the playroom occupies 276 tsubo, and the playground occupies 1291 tsubo. There are two gardens, one is Qingfeng and the other is Nishino, co-located with night schools, and the use of space seems to be adoptable. It is found that the education of young children in the world has a tendency to expand to start at the age of two. Because "three years old determines a lifetime", early childhood education cannot be taken lightly. In the future, we should further observe the nurseries in that country to serve as a reference. (Nurseries in Wuxi and other places in our country are also worth referring to.)</p>
<p>The Municipal Commercial and Industrial Practical School is at the middle school level and focuses on special training in the two subjects of commerce and industry. Most of the teaching time is used at night. The admission qualification is graduation from ordinary elementary school and completion of one year of higher elementary school. In addition to commercial and industrial undergraduate courses, there are also higher courses, studying English commerce, with a study period of one year. (2) Dozens of specialized courses, such as automobile science, are completed in six months. (3) Women's technical arts courses, such as sewing and crafts. (4) Women's specialized courses, such as sewing and crafts. The teaching time is during the day for the former and at night for the latter. There are currently 1,844 undergraduate students, 76 classes of specialized students, 3,759 students, 125 classes of commercial students, 32 students, 2 grades, for a total of 5,635 people, 203 grades. My country's cities, especially Shanghai, deeply feel the lack of such schools. The municipal secondary schools include two girls' high schools, three commercial schools for boys (with a night school), one commercial school for girls, and one school of arts for girls. There are 114 classes in the school board, 5,444 students, and 208 staff members. The school buildings of one or two schools are of the latest style, and most can still be used in the past.</p>
<p>Kobe's school health is quite advanced. Each school has a nursing room and handles it seriously. The municipal school health doctor had 3 full-time and 71 part-time in Showa 2, no part-time dentists, and 4 school health nurses, for a total cost of 16,782 gold. In Showa 8, there were still 3 full-time school doctors, 86 part-time school doctors, 34 part-time dentists, 9 full-time school health nurses, and 1 part-time school health nurse, for a total cost of 21,541 gold. The high efficiency of school health does not lie in the number of school doctors, but in the expansion of the quality of school health nurses. The correction work, medical management, and family coordination all require the assistance of nurses. Since the United States set up school nurses in 1903, the results have been remarkable. According to statistics, before there were nurses in Philadelphia, only 20% of students with eye diseases could be cured, 10% with dental diseases, and only 35% with tonsil swelling. Since hiring nurses, the treatment of diseases has made great progress. The treatment of various defects in children is above 80%. There is now a trend in Japan to hire more nurses, and Kobe has already implemented this.</p>
<p>The results of the physical examination of teachers and nannies in the city show that 1,811 men and 667 women were disease-free, 44 men and 9 women were sick, 1,391 men and 426 women were of the first grade in physique, 462 men and 246 women were of the second grade, and 2 men and 4 women were of the third grade. The physical fitness of Japanese teachers is strong, which can be seen in general. Setting an example will definitely have a great effect.</p>
<p>Among the 899 kindergarten children in the city, 463 are male and 436 are female. The physical examination status is 151 males and 172 females in the first grade, 1208 males and 263 females in the second grade, 4 males and 1 female in the third grade, and very few are ill. Among the 52,936 male and 4,919 female elementary school children who were physically examined, 12,459 males and 12,303 females were listed in the first grade, 29,858 males and 27,378 females were listed in the second grade, and 10,618 males and 9,238 females were listed in the third grade. Among the 2,537 male and 2,766 female middle school students who were physically examined, a total of 5,303 were examined. 846 males and 1,085 females were listed in the first grade, 1,298 males and 1,382 females were listed in the second grade, and 393 males and 299 females were listed in the third grade. The points we should pay attention to are: (1) As the years increase, the development results are getting worse. (2) There are still few people in the third grade.</p>

<h3>More Than Half of County Education Associations Participate in Initiating Provincial Education Association</h3>
<p>Meeting of Promoters to be Convened Next Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Association, in order to contact the education associations of various counties to promote education in Jiangsu Province, initiated the organization of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association last year and sent letters to the education associations of various counties to solicit their consent. Since the number of counties that agreed to initiate the association did not reach more than half, the progress was slow. The association immediately sent another letter to the education associations of the counties that had not joined the initiation to solicit their consent. So far, more than half have agreed. The association plans to convene a meeting of the promoters next month to carry out preparatory matters.</p>

<h3>Baoshan County Education Bureau Chief Feng Guohua's Statement on the Petition of Guanlan Middle School</h3>
<p>Feng Guohua, Chief of the Baoshan County Education Bureau, wrote: "Editor Guang Sheng, I have carefully examined the education news column in your newspaper on April 21, regarding the news item 'Petition of Guanlan Middle School in Dianzhen.' Many of the facts are not consistent with the truth. Upon investigation, the school was originally named 'Private Baoshan Chufa Middle School' when it was established in 1930. It was renamed later, not to commemorate Mr. Yuan Guanlan. In February 1933, Provincial Inspector Zhou Yuxin visited the county for inspection and made the following criticisms of the school: 'The school buildings are small, the number of students is also small, and the spirit of operation is lax. Strict supervision and rectification should be carried out immediately, and the school board should be instructed to properly raise funds, carefully select a principal, determine the school buildings, and apply for registration in accordance with the law to solidify the school's foundation, otherwise it will be banned.' In July 1933, County Government Order No. 1150 was received, relaying Education Department Order No. 7539, ordering the school to improve its equipment. Principal Yang Qiyi did not meet the qualifications stipulated in Article 107 of the Middle School Regulations and should be re-elected. In November 1933, County Government Order No. 105 was received, relaying Education Department Order No. 2119, ordering the dissolution of the teacher training class. The Bureau complied with the order and relayed it, but it was not followed. On January 19 of this year, Mr. Hu Pu'an, chairman of the school board, sent a letter denying being a school board member and published a statement in the Minbao on January 22. On March 30, County Government Order No. relayed the Education Department's order, stating that no one was responsible for the school board and that the school's operation violated laws and regulations. The school board's registration should be revoked, and the school should be suspended. It was ordered to supervise and expedite the closure and report. The Bureau will naturally comply with the order to relay the order to the school to close within a time limit. The teachers and students of the school came to the Bureau on the 19th to petition, and four representatives, including Zhu Zhenxiong, were selected. Guohua personally met with them. The above situation is entirely factual. Please publish it in the letter column of your newspaper to correct the record. Feng Guohua, Chief of the Baoshan County Education Bureau, April 21."</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Consultation Department of the China Chemical Industry Association</h3>

It publishes association journals, compiles chemical industry books, holds scientific lectures, and introduces specialized talents, enabling technicians and industrialists to connect with each other. Its past achievements have been excellent, and it has gained social trust. Recently, the number of people who entrust the association with introducing chemical industry talents and consulting on chemical industry issues has been increasing. In order to serve society and promote the chemical industry, the association has established a consultation department. This was approved by the ninth annual meeting, and the executive and review departments decided on the methods. All members will be divided into several groups according to their interests and expertise to engage in research. When there is a need to introduce specialized talents or answer technical questions, accurate methods will be used within a possible range. It is reported that the department has now been organized and established, and it will definitely make satisfactory contributions and become a bellwether of society.</p>

<h3>Cheng Changyuan Compiles Index to the Imperial Encyclopaedia, Manuscript Completed, Very Convenient for Checking, To Be Published Soon</h3>
<p>The Imperial Encyclopaedia (Gujin Tushu Jicheng) is the largest extant encyclopaedia in China. However, it is extensive and rarely circulated. It is known as the Chinese Encyclopaedia. Recently, the Zhonghua Book Company obtained the first printed movable type version and reproduced it. However, the book has been published for more than 200 years, and there has been no index compiled for it in China except for the original 40-volume catalogue. An Englishman, Giles, compiled an index to the book, which was published in London. It is not easy to find in China and is not suitable for Chinese people. Cheng Changyuan of the Library Science Department of Wuchang Wenhua University of Library Science decided to compile an index for the book last year and finished it in five months. It is divided into four parts: ㈠ General Catalogue Section, which is a condensed version of the original catalogue, but the ethnic code is arranged by sound in the original book, which is inconvenient for checking, so it is not included. ㈡ Subject Section, which includes 28 codes other than the clan, geography, mountains and rivers, and border codes, arranged by stroke order. Those with the same stroke order are ordered by the starting point, horizontal, vertical, and stroke. ㈢ Surname Section, which specifically includes the clan code. ㈣ Place Name Section, which includes the geography, mountains and rivers, and border codes. The original book of the Geography Code takes the prefecture as the unit. Cheng compiled it and listed the county name as an item, so it is not necessary to grab the prefecture name when checking, which is especially convenient. After several revisions, the manuscript was completed at the beginning of this month. It is said that it will be published and released in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Association Plans to Establish a Library</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate research for its members, the Shanghai Municipal Education Association, through its 24th board meeting, decided to purchase several new educational books each month and plans to continue to increase purchases in order to establish a library in the shortest possible time so that members can borrow them. The borrowing rules have been drafted and were distributed to the secretaries of each district education association and all directors and supervisors yesterday.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement Drills in Various Schools</h3>
<p>Guangdong Elementary and Middle School Zhabei Fusheng Road Guangdong Elementary and Middle School believes that the New Life Movement is closely related to civic training. In addition to organizing and implementing them separately, the civic training curriculum and the New Life Movement are combined. In order to expand publicity and make students' parents pay special attention, it is scheduled to be held this Saturday evening (April 21) at 8:00 PM at the Overseas Chinese Radio Station at 47 Ningbo Road. Lin Fengan, director of the school's teaching affairs, will give a lecture on "Family Education and the New Life Movement" for one hour.</p>
<p>Tiehua Elementary and Middle School Lu Tiemin, principal of Tiehua Elementary and Middle School on Ju'ji Da Road, invited Xu Zerang to give a lecture on the meaning of the New Life Movement, so that young people can understand the true meaning of it. It is also planned to formulate publicity methods.</p>
<h3>Zhenhua Elementary School Prepares for Exhibition</h3>
<p>The private Zhenhua Elementary School in the Cotton Cloth Office on Father Rhodes Road in the French Concession was reorganized in the autumn of 1932 and hired Mr. Yang to preside over educational affairs. The school's affairs are getting better every day. At the beginning of this spring semester, Mr. Yang adhered to the school board's intention to pay attention to strict training and education and improve the students' level. Therefore, the school is now preparing for an achievement exhibition, which will be held next month. It is also reported that the Municipal Education Bureau has approved the school's registration recently.</p>

<h3>Youth Worries and Health Education</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>(1) The Mischief of Worries</p>
<p>Youth, youth, what a sweet, lovely, energetic, and hopeful word! Youth is the golden age, and the future of youth is a promising future. In theory, it should be filled with joyous emotions; in theory, it should reveal a high-spirited spirit. However, the facts tell us that this is not always the case. Many young people are often frowning and downcast, as if all the misfortunes in the world are concentrated on them. As a result, there is world-weariness and detachment from the mundane world, a make-the-most-of-today-and-drink-your-fill attitude, and even a tendency toward the romanticism of living in luxury, and the depravity of murder and arson.</p>
<p>The reasons seem very complex, but they are also very simple. Why do lively young people become so corrupted and depraved? In my opinion, this is all caused by the mischief of the word "worries." Because during the youth period, both physiology and psychology undergo sudden changes, and in terms of thinking, it is easy to have fantasies; in terms of emotions, changes are often unpredictable. All states are markedly fluid and unstable. At the same time, they are constantly invaded by environmental stimulation, which causes hemp-like worries. Their entire body and mind are densely surrounded by layers of worries, and almost everything they see is worries. To try to break through this encirclement, but there are thorns everywhere, and dead ends everywhere, finally causing the weak-willed youth to unknowingly develop a downward-spiraling heart. If we want to save them, we can only find ways to solve their worries. To solve their worries, we can only find the causes of worries in order to prescribe the right medicine.</p>
<p>(2) The Causes of Worries</p>
<p>Of course, the worrying phenomena of youth are numerous, but the causes of worries are very obvious and have clues to follow. According to my analysis, the main factors can be summarized into the following three major factors: ㈠ academic problems, ㈡ career problems, ㈢ marriage problems. Young people may have problems in solving any one or all of these problems, which may lead to a proliferation of worries, and even corruption and depravity. Once young people go astray, the country and society will suffer unlimited losses. These losses cannot be redeemed by anything. We must not wait and see.</p>
<p>(3) The Relief of Worries</p>
<p>Now that the causes of worries have been found, we should apply appropriate methods to give them a way out and relieve them of their suffering. I think "health education" is the best way out for them. Health is originally the treasure of life. We would rather sacrifice bungalows, cars, and pearls and treasures, but we must not lack health. The country also needs it, and civilization cannot do without it. Here, we can quote two passages from British Prime Minister George and psychologist Hall to prove this. George said, "A first-class country cannot be created with a nation of third-class physiques." Hall's words are like this, "With a golden age of physique, there will be a golden age of culture thirty years later." This clearly states that health is the key to our prosperity. Naturally, worried young people should get closer to it and treat it as a treasure. It can save you from death and bring you back to life, it can help you turn danger into safety, it can give you wisdom to solve academic problems, it can give you wealth to solve career problems, and it can give you beauty to solve marriage problems. If anyone does not believe it, please listen to the following statement.</p>

<p>— Luo Ailan</p>
<p>Second Letter: Several American Popular Songs About Chinese People</p>
<p>Brother Lie Wen:</p>
<p>Since arriving in the United States, I have developed an inextricable relationship with radio broadcasting here. In the past five years, I have bought two new radio receivers. Although I have spent a lot of money, even trying to save a few cents from my daily food expenses to pay for this extra expense, it has not been without reward. From the radio broadcasts, I hear very important news every night, especially when China and Japan were at war in Shanghai, there were important reports of war results almost every half hour; in addition, I can hear speeches by celebrities and important football games between schools. What I like to listen to most is the music in the broadcasts, which gives me a lot of comfort. My brother knows how boring life is overseas. If it weren't for it, sometimes this empty house and this lonely heart would drive me crazy.</p>
<p>Among the music broadcasts, what I hear most often are American popular songs. Except for a very few, the authors of these songs are unknown, but they can cater to the psychology of ordinary Americans and represent the common taste of Americans. Some of them first appeared in musical films, and some of them were first used in New York musicals, and then flowed into the folk, and music teams everywhere played these songs. Their lives are not very long, because after a song comes out, everyone likes to sing it, but in a month or two, people feel tired of listening to it, so many new songs appear one after another. Their content is mostly about love between men and women, and the words are all common slang and dialects in the United States. Many of them are very well done, but most of them are incomprehensible, incomprehensible, and three times incomprehensible, but the melody is good. New York is the center of dissemination of these songs. Many songs became famous on Broadway in New York and then flowed to various places. People on Broadway call songs that sing about lost love Torch Songs, and people who sing such songs are called Torch Singers.</p>
<p>In addition to listening to radio broadcasts, I sometimes go to Broadway to play and buy the cheapest seats to listen to the best musicals (so-called musicals are Musical Drama or Musical Show, which should not be confused with opera Opera). Therefore, I have heard a lot of American popular songs, and sometimes I can sing a few sentences myself. Among these many popular songs, I heard several songs related to Chinese people.</p>
<p>Speaking of the knowledge of ordinary American people about China, it is really pitifully weak. From legends and from movies, the China they know is a strange country that is poor, famine-stricken, and full of thieves and internal strife. All overseas Chinese in the United States are murderers, opium smokers, workers in chop suey restaurants, and laundrymen. Chinatown is a gathering place for drug addicts, gamblers, and murderers. These few songs about Chinese people are also inevitable in this color.</p>
<p>The earliest song about China that I heard was called "Chinatown, My Chinatown" (China, town, my Chinatown,). I can't remember the original lyrics at all now, but it's probably nothing more than insulting Chinese people. After that, I paid attention to this kind of song and wrote down their lyrics one by one. Now I have collected seven of them, and I have translated them. The original text has many dialects, and it is extremely difficult to find corresponding Chinese words. In an effort to preserve the original meaning, I do not use direct translation in many places.</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai Lil This song was sung in a movie called Footlight Parade, and later it became popular for a while. This movie may have arrived in China now.</p>
<p>Walk all the roads in the world, climb all the mountains in the world, enter heaven, enter the earth, find my Shanghai Lil. ························ The stars are shining in the sky of Shanghai, bringing me many thrilling memories, enter heaven, enter the earth, find my Shanghai Lil. ························ I know I love her, that little goblin is just a butterfly, but her eyes reveal true feelings. Oh, I want to forget her, what's the use? How can I forget? Enter heaven, enter the earth, find my Shanghai Lil.</p>
<h3>Modern Trends in the Literary World</h3>
<p>— Antique</p>
<p>I don't know when, "talented scholars and beautiful ladies" have floated up again. Although it is not necessarily a phlegm-obsessed mind, it must be buzzing and murmuring with old tunes, and writing must cite one or two allusions, and use "zhī hū yě zhě" from time to time, or even deliberately violate the rules and "reply in verse" to several poems, as if it has become a refined style. Someone said that "the old tune has been sung," and it seems that "unfinished" will still "not be finished"!</p>
<p>To "examine" the source of talented scholars, it probably stems from reactionary thoughts. Because they are highly talented, emotionally excited, and dissatisfied with the status quo, but there is nothing they can do, so they play with the world indifferently. Just look at Zheng Banqiao, Wang Zhonghuo, Yuan Zi, Gong Zizhen, and Liu Tieyun, and you will know what a libertine looks like. There are other motives, and they are not satisfied with romantic affairs or fine wine and women. Hou Fangyu, a little further away, is far from being like this.</p>
<p>The talent of talented scholars is unbearable because they probably don't know that there are others in the world. The talent of "untalented scholars" is even more likely to make people run away. Xi Shi holding her heart is the best metaphor. This is also added to the decadence of Western metropolises and the barbarism of the colonies, and then the "modern" demeanor is achieved. "Modern" has aroused "destroyers," but in fact, destruction groups are also "modern."</p>
<p>This trend should still be attributed to "Master Manshu" and the "humor" gentlemen of modern times cannot shirk their responsibility. It has led to young men and women, each one is familiar with illness, weak and unable to withstand the wind, with a toothpick in the corner of their mouths and a volume of "The Analects" under their arms. Without a bit of strong spirit or profound thought, everyone is leisurely in shallow streams.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, this current situation is really humorous. All the elites are gathered in this modern archetype, but they themselves are so unhealthy. In less than ten years, they will all drift away and wither. Even the current modern figures are all middle-aged. Once the environment changes and the burden of life increases, their bodies will weaken and their moods will become fragmented, as if everything is impossible. Even the leisurely pleasure of the shallow water is unattainable.</p>
<p>But the Han people were not originally like this. They were originally brave, broad, and peaceful. Although the ancient literati often suffered from illness, their vitality was strong. Gu Tinglin led troops and Lu You liked to hunt tigers, which are examples. The current trend is so decadent because the weak are still suitable for survival. There is no way to solve the problem, so they can only waste their lives in the state of "talented scholars and beautiful ladies." The popularity of "The Analects" and "Human World" is the reason for this.</p>
<h3>Mask</h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>When I was little, I liked to watch monkey shows. Even now, I can vaguely recall what the monkey show was like. Naturally, the monkey's performance was directed by a person. As soon as the gongs and drums sounded, the monkey would ride on the back of a goat in circles. What was interesting was that the monkey wore a mask. There were adults and children watching the show, and I don't know how they felt. But once, I thought the one riding the goat was a person instead of a monkey. This happened when I was two or three years old, and I told the person who took me to see the monkey show. Why? Because the monkey was wearing a mask.</p>
<p>However, a monkey is still a monkey, and the show was clearly called a "monkey show." Later, I understood that the one on the goat's back was not a person.</p>
<p>"It's a monkey! Look, it has a tail!"</p>
<p>So, I discovered the tail.</p>
<p>In fact, it's not just monkeys that wear masks. People often hide their true faces. It's just that monkeys have tails, which makes it easier for people to expose them.</p>
<p>It is said that European and American countries are civilized, especially the United States, which everyone admires immensely. There's no need to cite other examples; just the doctors who have returned from the United States are enough to prove it, because they always talk about American civilization and worship Americans all day long.</p>
<p>"For example, American prisons are much cleaner than Chinese prisons, and the air is..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, the listener would invariably believe that American prisons are more civilized than Chinese prisons. For example, the death penalty is very rare in the United States, and when it is used, it is done with an electric chair. China is much more cruel: execution by shooting is commonplace, and sometimes people are beheaded! Therefore, the doctor feels that China is barbaric and boasts about American civilization.</p>
<p>At first, I also believed these words. The United States is indeed worthy of being a civilized land of gold. But now!!</p>
<p>Although I have not had the opportunity to visit the United States, I inadvertently saw a movie in Shanghai called "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang." The original author of this film is an American, Robert E. Burns. He told me something: the one riding on the goat's back and putting on a show is not a person, but a monkey wearing a mask! Then I suddenly realized that the most developed American civilization of modern capitalism is like this.</p>
<p>"Don't believe it? Take a look at the Chain Gang in Georgia!" I want to expose this mask!</p>
<h3>Yan Zi in a Humble Lane</h3>
<p>— Bai Ge</p>
<p>From the Confucius Temple to the Confucius Forest, one must pass through a lane. Although it is called a lane, it is actually a street. In the aging and stubborn city of Qufu, there are many streets like this, but because it is said to be the humble lane where Yan Zi lived in the past, and there is a stone archway erected at the entrance with the words "Humble Lane" carved on it, we generally refer to it as the lane, or "Humble Lane."</p>
<p>"Humble Lane" is indeed worthy of being called "Humble Lane." The houses on both sides are pitifully small, and some are even interspersed with thatched huts with bald tops. Everything expresses a sense of humility, which a person who has not attained the Master's Way would truly find unbearable. However, Yan Zi, who did not change his joy, is no longer here, but in the magnificent temple above. The temple is located above the exit of "Humble Lane" and is generally called Yan Temple. The red walls and tall temple gates also give people a sense of solemnity, but not as grand as the Confucius Temple. Upon entering, one immediately senses a wild, natural atmosphere. Originally, there was a large lawn in front, interspersed with various ancient trees, but this is only in summer. If it were winter, a desolate scene would lie before us. Only the "Humble Lane Well," as one of the historical sites, lies in a corner, indicating the existence of everything.</p>
<p>The well is very deep. A thatched pavilion stands above it. Perhaps it is because the pavilion cuts off the light that it appears so deep. Although I do not know whether the water Yan Zi drank at that time was drawn from this well, it is clear that no one has drawn water from this well to drink since then. I think, if it were not for the railing around the thatched pavilion where people can sit and rest, probably no one would want to stop here. Beside the pavilion is a strange tree, seemingly deliberately designed, spiraling above the pavilion. It looks very unique, but unfortunately, an iron ring has been added around its neck, and it will soon rot under the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the main hall, one immediately sees the short-lived Yan Zi sitting majestically, posing as the Second Sage. But here, he cannot arouse people's admiration, but only a little pitying sympathy. Because this magnificent temple has long been bombarded into a "Humble Lane" by the warlords' artillery. A bamboo mat tops the shrine, with stones pressing down on the four corners. Just by looking at the roof where the sky can be seen, one naturally knows that this is to shield Yan Zi from the wind and rain. Walking further back, one sees rubble scattered everywhere, and the surviving pillars and rafters still biting on several unexploded shells, writing for us the traces and horrors of war. Thus, an infinite feeling wells up from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>"Yan Zi, who had already entered the temple, is now bombarded by the warlords' artillery and can only remain in the humble lane. Is this his destined fate again?" This is the last sentence that surfaced in my mouth.</p>
<h3>Travel Diary of the West (9)</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>After walking around the spiral path, turning towards a mountain corner, you arrive at Xiling Chuihong outside the gate of East Tianmu Mountain, which is truly a picturesque scene. Upon arriving here, seeing the waterfall that looks like a silver river falling from the ninth heaven, the stone walls on both sides of the waterfall, and the bridge pavilion erected where the waterfall flows smoothly (named Chuihong Bridge Pavilion), you will be greatly surprised, thinking how there could be such a beautiful, elegant, and ethereal waterfall and architecture in such a high mountain. We, a group of mountain travelers resembling refugees, forgot our hunger and fatigue upon reaching the waterfall pool, and spouted affected, pedantic poetry. Squatting down and jumping around, we all became mischievous children, natural savages, completely restoring our original faces. When the people who arrived at the temple earlier came out to greet us and told us to hurry up and have lunch, we reluctantly left the cliff waterfall on the west side of the mountain gate, turning our heads back with each step.</p>
<p>Leaving the waterfall, passing Chuihong, ascending the steps, walking along the mountain path lined with trees for about a mile, and then going up another level, turning a corner, you arrive at the inner hall of Zhaoming Zen Temple.</p>
<p>The guest room where we stayed, also the abbot's meditation and resting room, is located on the east side of the back of the temple, a mountain building built along the cliff. The mountain room is clean, high, and spacious, untouched by the mundane world. Clouds and mist sometimes come. Compared to West Tianmu, the scale is slightly smaller, but because of its high location, it is quieter and more compact, even better. East Tianmu also has its own generator, equipped with electric lights for the exclusive use of the temple. This is somewhat similar to the Wen Chang Pavilion, the large hotel in Putuo. The abbot, Deming, is young, intelligent, capable of managing, and good at socializing. After we arrived, he accompanied us to meals and mountain hikes. In his conversations, he revealed his ability to be the abbot of this famous mountain area. Checking the history of Zhaoming Zen Temple (see the Dongchu Zhi), it naturally comes from Prince Zhaoming. During the Liang Datong period, the monk Baozhi (also known as Zhigong) flew here with his staff. It was destroyed at the end of the Yuan Dynasty and rebuilt in the twentieth year of the Ming Hongwu reign. It was destroyed again at the beginning of the Wanli reign, and rebuilt by Huang Ling of Lin'an during the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty. During the Taiping Rebellion, it was naturally destroyed again. The repairers after this, Wang Ming, can be understood by looking at the existing inscriptions. Although the scale of the temple is not as grand as that of Chanyuan Temple in West Tianmu, the Hall of Heavenly Kings, the Hall of Weituo, the Great Hero Hall, and the Sutra Depository are all complete. Unfortunately, the Sutra Depository does not store sutras, but is a Thousand Buddha Pavilion with golden walls on all four sides, called the Hundred Sons Hall by the locals, located on the west side of the temple. In addition, there are not many monks, and only a few thatched huts on the entire mountain rely on the main temple for food. From this, we can know that the temple's property is definitely not as rich and extensive as that of West Tianmu. However, the donations from patrons and the contributions from devout men and women must be considerable throughout the year, otherwise, where would the funds for installing electric lights and building repairs come from?</p>
<h3>Farm Woman</h3>
<p>— Ye Hua</p>
<p>In the vast fields, the golden rice ears drag down the trembling sunset. She is alone, bending her back, her hands working tirelessly. Letting the hardships of the years quietly whiten the small sickle. She cuts down the rice, then bundles it up bunch by bunch. Humming a little tune, sighing, her heavy footsteps dragging through the mud. She is infinitely worried, her hands ceaselessly counting the few sheep and goats on the slope, as the crows fly up. She suddenly hears in her ears: (Mom, I'm hungry! Mom, I'm hungry!)</p>
<h3>Mother (3)</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>At dinner, the girl asked her father if Aunt Li could sing and teach her many things. Only the older brother said nothing. He sometimes looked at his father and sometimes at his sister. The silence of this older child could not but make the father pay attention. In the heart of an eight-year-old child, a second mother must not be a happy thing. The father looked at him several times, wanting to say something, but finally did not know what to say.</p>
<p>In the evening, when the father went to bed, he looked at the two sleeping children as usual. He kissed the older child on the forehead and gently said in his mouth: "Ming, don't think that Dad has changed and become a little estranged from Dad. Dad is still the same Dad who loves you as always!" He carefully put the child's hand into the quilt, and then saw the younger one, her face turned to the side, slightly opened her mouth, as if still retaining the happiness of the day. He brushed away some of the short hair from her forehead and also placed a kiss on her forehead. He himself went to sleep, but today's spirit was too excited, no matter how he could not calm himself down, many thoughts came to disturb his heart. Once he confessed his long-hidden thoughts in front of the children, he did not know why he felt like he had done something sorry for them. He remembered that he often told the children about their deceased mother's life, and he often taught the children how to commemorate their mother, thinking of the many good things about their mother. The children already had a deep impression of their mother's memory. Now, telling them that Aunt Li would be their mother, wouldn't the older child be a little unnatural? The father saw such an unhappy feeling in the always innocent and lovely child for the first time. He touched the sadness for the first time in the progress of this matter. He had never forgotten his deceased wife. There was not a day that he did not recall his deceased wife's smiling face and demeanor! After ten years of cohabitation, he felt that even the smallest things were very beautiful when he recalled them. His wife was so delicate and gentle, and she often said such a sentence: "Dad, do you feel happy?" She was originally considerate of him everywhere, but happiness left with her. Therefore, for the children left behind by his deceased wife, he was especially fond of them for the sake of commemorating her, and he also fulfilled some of the mother's duties in the four years of his single life. In the first two years, no matter how much his friends tried to persuade him, he always refused a second marriage, but the sadness gradually faded away, and the single life told him many experiences. How unnatural is the life of a single man! For these two reasons, he had been very close to Sun Liying in the past few months, and the decision to remarry was made two weeks ago.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis and Social Relief</h3>
<p>— Weng Zhilong</p>
<p>Germany can be considered the most hygienic country in Europe. Statistically speaking, the mortality rate from pulmonary tuberculosis among the middle class in Germany was 26 per 10,000 people in 1893 (40 years ago), 20.7 in 1903 (30 years ago), and 14.3 in 1913 (the second year of the Republic of China, i.e., 20 years ago). From this, we can see that the mortality rate from tuberculosis decreased year by year. Later, towards the end of the European War (the seventh year of the Republic of China, i.e., 1918), the mortality rate from tuberculosis suddenly increased due to the lack of food among the people, reaching as many as 23 per 10,000 people. Since the end of the war, with the implementation of self-encouragement and anti-tuberculosis measures, the mortality rate from tuberculosis has been only 8 per 10,000 people! Everyone! This is the achievement of German anti-tuberculosis efforts. The governments of other countries, such as England, France, Italy, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Hungary, are all actively promoting hygiene, and the people also have many anti-tuberculosis associations working. The statistics of tuberculosis mortality in their respective countries are decreasing year by year. Thinking back to our China, it is truly pitiful. We don't know how many innocent people have died unjustly. Therefore, there is now a movement in Shanghai to establish the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association. Mayor Wu Tiecheng strongly supports and vigorously promotes it. He is the president of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association. People in our medical community are also willing to contribute. We also hope that wealthy people will contribute more money. Everyone should take responsibility and do this well. As the saying goes, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." Everyone wants to protect their own lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. This work is a major task of protecting oneself, protecting children and grandchildren, and protecting the lives of the entire nation. I hope that compatriots from all walks of life will work together and participate in unity to do this well!</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is very easy to spread and is a "disease of the poor," closely related to economic factors. As mentioned above, according to the principle established by Cebhard, the lower the income of people, the higher the tuberculosis mortality rate; the richer the income of people, the lower the tuberculosis mortality rate. Insurance companies also have similar reports, saying that the lower the insurance premiums paid, the higher the tuberculosis mortality rate; the higher the insurance premiums paid, the lower the tuberculosis mortality rate. It is a common phenomenon that people contract tuberculosis due to economic oppression. In addition to this, there are three other things that are indirectly related to the economy: "food," "housing," and "work." Now, let's talk about these three things.</p>
<p>(1) Work: Statistics on tuberculosis mortality in Germany show that it is higher in cities than in rural areas, and even higher in industrial areas than in cities and rural areas. This is because the air, clothing, food, and housing in industrial areas are mostly unsuitable, and the work is very heavy. Therefore, many people die from tuberculosis. Especially during the European War, the number of German women who died from tuberculosis increased significantly because at that time, men went out to fight in the war, and women were constantly worried and could not settle down. On the one hand, they had to work in national factories, and both their work and mood were very bad, so the number of people suffering from tuberculosis increased. There are also significant relationships with other occupations, such as dusty work, cotton workers, stonemasons, etc., which are harmful to the respiratory system and easily lead to tuberculosis. Also, such as shoemakers and tailors, who often bend over and hunch over to work, are also prone to tuberculosis. These are all cases of contracting tuberculosis due to overwork. Tuberculosis spreads and death is caused by work.</p>
<p>(2) Food: Nutrition is deeply related to tuberculosis (i.e., tuberculosis). During the European War in Germany, the mortality rate from tuberculosis in mental hospitals and other hospitals accounted for 50%. This was caused by the enemy's blockade, food shortages, and restrictions. Also, the mortality rate from tuberculosis was relatively higher in cities during the war, because rural areas still had agricultural products and meat foods such as poultry raised by farmers, which could provide some nourishment. Although people in cities had money, it was not easy to buy them, and they were very scarce due to food restrictions. Wassermaud's investigation showed that during the European War, because of food shortages, the state implemented food restrictions and used ration cards. Every time the food supply was reduced, the tuberculosis mortality rate among the people increased. This relationship can prove that poor diet can affect the spread and death of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(3) Housing: Before the war, there was already a feeling of housing shortage in German cities due to population growth. After the war, all the Germans in the colonies returned to the country, plus the return of soldiers, there was truly a housing shortage. Before the war, attics and cellars were not inhabited, but now they had to be inhabited. Moreover, several people lived in one room, and the air was very bad. The increase in tuberculosis deaths was also a major reason. In addition, after the war, people were poor, and there was a shortage of coal, so it was not easy for poor people to start a stove. Many people developed tuberculosis from colds. At the same time, due to poor economic conditions, insufficient food and nutrition, the spread of tuberculosis became even easier.</p>
<p>Housing is greatly related to the transmission of tuberculosis. A 1918 report from Berlin, Germany, stated that 4,943 citizens died of pulmonary tuberculosis and laryngeal tuberculosis. Among them, 2,546 died in hospitals, and the remaining 2,397 died in residential areas. The housing of these 2,397 deceased persons is classified as follows:</p>
<p>The number of deceased living in a house with one room was 109</p>
<p>The number of deceased living in a house with two rooms was 782</p>
<p>The number of deceased living in a house with three rooms was 976</p>
<p>The number of deceased living in a house with four rooms was 312</p>
<p>The number of deceased living in a house with six rooms was 30</p>
<p>The number of deceased living in a house with seven or more rooms was 13</p>
<p>The number of deceased and survivors per house among the above 2,397 houses is statistically as follows:</p>
<p>One person per house: 107 people</p>
<p>Two people per house: 425 people</p>
<p>Three people per house: 598 people</p>
<p>Four people per house: 575 people</p>
<p>Five people per house: 328 people</p>
<p>Six people per house: 170 people</p>
<p>Seven people per house: 65 people</p>
<p>Eight people per house: 34 people</p>
<p>Nine people per house: 8 people</p>
<p>Ten people per house: 3 people</p>
<p>Eleven people per house: 1 person</p>
<p>From this, we can see that a small house with a large number of people is also a reason for tuberculosis deaths.</p>
<p>After looking at the above situation, we know that in addition to improving economic conditions, the three things of food, housing, and work must be paid attention to and improved in order to prevent tuberculosis.</p>
<p>What I just talked about was the relationship between tuberculosis and the economy, as well as the reasons for the occurrence of tuberculosis due to social relations. Now, I will talk about the work that the Anti-Tuberculosis Association is preparing to do.</p>
<p>(1) Popularize anti-tuberculosis education throughout the country: The purpose is to make everyone aware of the dangers of tuberculosis, and everyone has the knowledge and determination to prevent tuberculosis. We plan to publish magazines, produce picture booklets, compile health and anti-tuberculosis teaching materials for schools at all levels, and send them to bookstores for adoption; invite doctors to give lectures at schools, and organize student summer lecture propaganda teams; issue anti-tuberculosis calendars, give them to members as gifts, and sell them; produce movies, etc., all of which we want to achieve one by one, so that everyone has the knowledge of health and anti-tuberculosis, and promote their determination to prevent tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(2) Establish preventive hospitals and sanatoriums: Early diagnosis, early treatment, early prevention, etc., are all in our plans. We are preparing to contact various hospitals and testing facilities to organize them; and we want to establish pulmonary sanatoriums, children's summer camps, and children's anti-tuberculosis hospitals, etc., to actively help compatriots from all walks of life, men and women, old and young, to get rid of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(3) Establish free clinics: The purpose is to help the poor masses so that they (i.e., those without money) have the opportunity to treat tuberculosis and prevent the spread of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(4) Research work: Such as the research on tuberculin skin test diagnosis, etc., we will actively carry out.</p>
<p>These things are very important for anti-tuberculosis, and should be organized. However, it is extremely difficult to organize them in our China, and it is not easy to do them well. We still hope that compatriots from all walks of life will help more so that we can complete them one by one in order to achieve the goal of saving the country and the nation. Ladies and gentlemen! Work hard and strive to fight with us!</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge About Skin Diseases (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Fourth, the skin has a respiratory function. Most people only know that the feet can breathe, not that the skin can also breathe. However, the amount is naturally not as much as that of the lungs. But the evaporation of water vapor is considerable. The climate during the plum rain season is not as hot as during the hot summer season, yet we feel a stifling discomfort that far surpasses that of the hot summer. This is because the humidity in the air is too high during the plum rain season, and the evaporation of water from the skin is limited.</p>
<p>Fifth, the skin has an absorption function. The skin can absorb all medications that are easily vaporized or dissolved in fats. This is very important for the treatment of skin diseases.</p>
<p>Sixth, the skin has the function of protecting the body. In addition to the various functions mentioned above, the skin can also cover the muscles and bones and use its elasticity to resist all external injuries. For example, when subjected to blows or pressure, the subcutaneous fat layer of the skin can be used to resist external forces and protect the internal organs from damage. For bacterial invasions, the stratum corneum of the epidermis can be used for defense. Therefore, as long as the skin is not damaged, bacteria cannot invade. If there is a small crack, bacteria can take the opportunity to enter, circulate through the blood and lymphatic fluid to the whole body, and cause fatal sepsis, pyemia, etc.</p>
<p>The above has explained, from the physiological and anatomical characteristics of the skin, that the skin is an important organ of the body. Then, for the second question, whether skin diseases should be treated, it goes without saying. However, ordinary people often mistakenly believe that after skin diseases are cured, the toxins in the body cannot be excreted to the outside, causing the belief that the toxins attack internally. For example, A says, "I have a relative who suffered from a skin disease. The doctor cured it, but after some time, an internal disease occurred. When the skin disease came back, the internal disease was cured." It is like a real proof that cannot be shaken. Now I will use simple scientific principles and metaphors to explain to you. Whenever a person has a chronic disease, it is as if the body has become accustomed to it. When there is a change in the body, the original accustomed situation will change. For example, people with chronic skin diseases, when encountering a febrile disease, suddenly do not feel itchy as usual, and the yellow fluid also suddenly stops flowing. When the fever subsides, the itching comes back, and the yellow fluid also flows, restoring to the previous situation. From a scientific point of view, this is because the inflammation inside the body temporarily reduces the congestion on the surface of the skin, or because the body temperature rises, producing a large number of antitoxins to reduce the toxins. We often encounter people with gonorrhea who originally have a large amount of pus flowing out, but suddenly develop epididymitis, and the pus temporarily decreases. When the fever of epididymitis subsides, the pus is still secreted, which is the same principle. Therefore, we must understand that the change in skin disease is the result, and the internal disease is the cause, not that the cure of the skin disease causes the internal disease, but that the occurrence of the internal disease causes the skin disease to temporarily subside. If a person who likes to smoke and drink unfortunately develops an internal disease, he will not like to smoke and drink. When he recovers, he will still be the same smoking and drinking. Can you also say that he developed an internal disease because he did not smoke or drink? It is only because after he was accustomed to smoking and drinking, when he encountered a change in his body, his habits changed. That is, the internal disease is the cause, and smoking and drinking is the result. But there are still some people who say that they do not feel any great harm if the skin disease is not cured. This is also a wrong concept. We often encounter eczema on the heads of children, which, because it is not treated, accumulates scabs and causes fever. It often has the danger of causing acute meningitis. There are also scabies, itchy rashes, etc. After being left alone for a long time, they often cause severe impetigo due to the spread of pyogenic bacteria, and even nephritis. Therefore, is it not a great mistake for the world to regard skin diseases as insignificant diseases?</p>
<h3>Breast Milk Is a Natural Elixir for Nourishing Infants</h3>
<p>— Qu Shaoheng</p>
<p>The people are the foundation of the nation. A healthy populace makes a strong nation, while a sickly populace weakens the nation. Therefore, a nation's strength truly hinges on the health of its people. The health of the people must be judged by whether infant care is handled properly from a young age. There are many and varied methods of infant care, but among them, the most important is nutrition. Looking at today's common sick infants, eight or nine out of ten are caused by unsuitable food. The milder cases hinder their development, creating a sickly populace, while the more severe cases harm their lives, destroying the nation's elements. Those who wish to save the nation must pay attention to infant nutrition.</p>
<p>Infant nutrition can be divided into two types: natural nutrition and artificial nutrition. Natural nutrition refers to nourishment with breast milk or a wet nurse. Artificial nutrition refers to nourishment with substances other than human milk, such as animal milk (from horses, cows, sheep, etc.) or milk powder, cakes, and the like. Natural nutrition is best with breast milk. This is because breast milk is similar to the mother's blood, often called "white blood." Since the fetus lives in the mother's body through the mother's blood, it should naturally be nourished with breast milk thereafter. Replacing it with other substances will inevitably be difficult to digest. This is because newborns have weak digestive power, and the composition of their mother's milk is perfectly suited to the infant's physiology. Moreover, it contains salts, so it also has a laxative effect. After three or four days, the infant gradually grows, and the milk quality gradually changes, and the concentration gradually increases. Subsequently, the infant's development is rapidly changing, and the quality and quantity of the components contained in the milk, such as protein, fat, carbohydrates, sugar, and salt, continue to increase with the infant's development, except when the mother has special reasons or illnesses, in order to meet the infant's needs. According to accurate survey reports, the physique of first-time mothers is different from that of subsequent mothers and mothers who have given birth again. The nature and composition of their milk are also different. Therefore, the milk of a wet nurse is not as suitable as breast milk. Conversely, the foods used in artificial nutrition, although there are various improved milk powders in recent years, the nature of their contents cannot have the precise changes of breast milk. Moreover, the infant's stomach and intestines often experience obstacles due to slight changes in the food's temperature, nature, and composition. For example, improper preparation, uneven heat, and uncertain amounts will harm both digestion and development. There are many kinds of artificial nutrition products, too numerous to list individually. The ones that are comparatively suitable for infants are, first, goat milk, followed by donkey and horse milk, then cow's milk, and lastly other milk powders and cakes. It is found that the most widely used in the world is cow's milk, because it is the easiest to obtain. Let us compare the advantages and disadvantages of human milk and cow's milk. Human milk has less protein, more sugar, and smaller milk globules, making it easy to digest. Cow's milk has more protein, less sugar, and larger milk globules, making it difficult to digest. Looking at the curds in the infant's vomit, those nourished with human milk have small curds, while those nourished with cow's milk have large curds. This proves that the protein-digesting enzymes in the infant's gastric juices, other than hydrochloric acid, are strong in digesting human milk protein, but weak in digesting cow's milk protein. Also, if ten percent ammonia water is added to twice the amount of human milk and warmed to sixty degrees Celsius, it will turn red. Cow's milk will have no reaction. If the same amount of guaiacol and two or three drops of hydrogen peroxide are added to cow's milk, it will turn blue. Human milk will have no reaction. This is clear evidence that human milk and cow's milk have different chemical reactions. Within a few days after birth, the infant's weight often decreases. The degree of reduction and the time required for recovery are less and faster for those nourished with breast milk, and more and slower for those nourished with cow's milk. Using foods that are unfavorable to physiology to nourish infants with weak stomach and intestinal resistance, it is appropriate that they fall into indigestion and anemia and weakness. Further, from a biological relationship perspective, the milk of all kinds of animals contains a special toxin. The animal of the same species can consume it and resist it with its innate antitoxins, but other animals that consume it must produce new antitoxins to resist it. Infants have weak physical strength and limited ability to produce antitoxic substances. They may be able to try their best to resist the toxins in this food, but when other toxins or pathogens invade, they have no remaining strength to resist, and the disease occurs. Moreover, from the time cow's milk is squeezed out until it enters the infant's mouth, it undergoes several procedures, and there are many opportunities for bacteria to invade. Since there are many opportunities for bacteria to invade, it is difficult to disinfect thoroughly. The people of our country have shallow knowledge of science, and the disinfection methods that are commonly considered are nothing more than boiling. How can one know that boiling disinfection has many disadvantages for cow's milk? Boiling causes the proteins to coagulate and other components to denature and become difficult to digest. Not boiling it completely will lead to incomplete disinfection, eventually causing harm. The greatest danger is drinking milk from sick cows, which can lead to infection with various diseases. Now that the disadvantages of cow's milk are clear, there is no need to mention other substitutes. Furthermore, breast milk nutrition is not only beneficial to the infant, but also beneficial to the mother's body. The stimulation of breastfeeding can promote uterine contraction, facilitate the discharge of lochia, promote increased appetite, and allow the whole body to recover. Benefiting both the child and the mother is truly a win-win nutrition method. Those in the world who abandon breast milk nutrition and take artificial nutrition, what foolishness could be greater? Modern women indulge in pleasure and comfort, are infatuated with society, strive for equal rights, consider childbirth a painful thing, and neglect childcare. They shout high-sounding slogans of saving the nation, but implement means of exterminating the race. Western scholars have long recognized the disadvantages of artificial nutrition and are working hard to correct the old habits within their countries. Can the people of our country still be deluded and not awaken? Some say that in rural villages, nine out of ten are breastfed, so why is the total number of infant deaths higher than in cities? I say that is not the case. This is because women lack common knowledge of childcare, resulting in breastfeeding not being done at the right time and childcare not being done properly. Because breastfeeding is very simple, whenever they hear a child cry, they put the breast in their mouth to silence them, and do not bother to ask if the crying is due to hunger, cold, itching, or pain, or if they want something. Even if the child refuses, they will force it on them. They do not know that after milk enters the stomach, human milk requires one and a half to two hours, and cow's milk requires two and a half to three hours, to be completely digested. Therefore, if they do not wait for it to be completely digested and continue to feed them, the digestive function will never have a period of rest. How can the stomach and intestines not get sick? Especially during illness, they often cry more due to suffering, and eat more due to crying more. Crying while eating is particularly easy to cause illness. Forcing them to eat is even more harmful to the stomach and intestines. Moreover, various functions decline during illness, so digestion is naturally not the same. Therefore, eating more during illness truly has the harm of promoting the disease and leading to a dangerous situation. If that is the case, even if breast milk is perfect, it cannot be said to be without drawbacks.</p>

<h3>A Brief Biography of Emile Roux, Director of the Pasteur Institute in Germany</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiajian</p>
<p>(4) A Visit to the Serum Manufacturing Plant</p>
<p>The place where the diphtheria antitoxin serum is now manufactured was originally the estate of Villeneuve l'Etang. In the past, French Emperor Napoleon III and his wife Eugenie spent their honeymoon here. Later, it became public property. In 1883, the Ministry of Education gifted it to Dr. Pasteur as a place to study grand epilepsy. After Dr. Roux delivered a moving declaration at the Budapest Congress, the board of directors of the institute decided to use the place to manufacture diphtheria antitoxin serum. Thus, the laboratory and stables were established. However, soon after, it also manufactured serum to treat other diseases, totaling more than ten. Therefore, there are now more than four hundred horses raised there. Mr. Le Médec, who led me on a tour of the serum manufacturing plant, is the deputy director of the plant. Mr. Le gave me a brief description of the method of manufacturing serum as follows:</p>
<p>To obtain a certain serum, a special "antigen" (Antlgene) must first be injected into the horse's body. The injection method is either subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The amount of antigen used is small at first and then increases. As for the duration of the first procedure, it varies depending on the type of serum desired. The shortest is several weeks, and the longest is several months. The first blood collection period is ten to fifteen days after the last injection of antigen. About seven liters are taken each time, and it is received in a glass jar. The blood collection time is best in the morning when the horse has not eaten, generally between 7:00 and 10:00 a.m. Four days later, another blood collection is performed. Then, the horse is allowed to rest for a week. Subsequently, the antigen is injected three or four times in two weeks. Ten to fifteen days after the last injection, blood is collected again. The serum manufacturing plant has as many as six hundred blood-filled glass jars, all disinfected with steam pressure. The amount of blood collected each week is about 1,400 liters, but the amount of serum that can be extracted is only half that. After blood collection, the glass jars are transported to a cellar with low temperature and no climate change. When the blood clots, a clear liquid floats on the surface of the blood, which is the serum. The time to collect the serum is four days after blood collection. After collection, the serum's special immune capacity must be tested. There are two methods of testing. One is purely the work of the laboratory, that is, using physical and chemical reaction methods. This method is used to test the diphtheria antitoxin serum. The second testing method is to test it in animals, that is, to test it with guinea pigs. This method is used to test other various sera. It can be seen from this that guinea pigs have a wide market. Therefore, there are thousands of guinea pigs raised in the serum manufacturing plant.</p>
<p>All serum obtained is stored in a cold place, that is, in the cellar. The temperature there never exceeds four degrees. There are thousands of storage glass jars, some of which contain refined serum that can be stored for many years. There are also sera that can be dried by steam pressure and transported to various dependent territories. When in use, they are rehydrated.</p>
<p>(5) The Evolution from Serum Therapy to</p>
<h3>Prevention</h3>
<p>Dr. Roux once wrote in a record in 1889, "Suppose that one day someone uses this toxin and its accessories for prevention, etc." Who knew that this statement would come true since 1924. The relative of Dr. Roux, Dr. Ramon, after repeated experiments, invented "Anatoxine," which is now commonly used to prevent diphtheria. To put it simply, anatoxin is a chemical body of diphtheria toxin. It forms a new, non-toxic constitution and is the most effective drug for immunity.</p>
<p>Subsequently, based on the same principle of converting diphtheria toxin into anatoxin, other toxins were converted in the same way to make preventive drugs for diseases such as dysentery.</p>
<p>As of now, the Pasteur Institute has supplied the world with as much as twelve tons of diphtheria preventive drugs since 1924. In terms of numbers, about five million people have been immunized with this drug.</p>
<p>According to the above sections, it can be seen that Dr. Roux's serum therapy, through the advancement and changes of later generations, still shines in the science of France and the world. However, one thing that has attracted my attention is that today's physiologists are increasingly replacing treatment with prevention. The first person to invent the prevention method was Dr. Jenner of France, who obtained it unintentionally. That time was in 1796. However, it had to wait for the research of the great doctor Pasteur (1864) before it entered the path of learning. Then, in 1881, Pasteur first used preventive drugs. From then on, researchers seemed to be advancing in this direction. However, due to the influence of Dr. Roux, doctors in the twenty years at that time did not focus on prevention, but focused on serum therapy. Before the European War, there were experts researching methods to prevent diseases such as typhoid fever and tuberculosis, but the period of advancement of prevention methods was after the Great War. Thus, Dr. Gormet's tuberculosis preventive drug and Dr. Ramon's diphtheria preventive drug appeared in the world and exerted their effectiveness. Now, if we ask which is better between serum therapy and prevention, we believe that this kind of discussion is a matter for the research institute. What we know is that, in terms of disease, both are in the example of being acceptable. However, according to the example of hygienists, prevention is better than treatment. But Dr. Roux's achievements, like those of the great doctor Pasteur, are no different. For later researchers, they are able to maintain their considerable power, or even for a very long time. Because after Dr. Roux invented the toxin, he was able to predict that it could be used for prevention and open up new paths for future generations. This is where the spirit of Dr. Roux will never fade.</p>

<p>Notice: I have published my manuscript "Talking About White Turbid Bacteria" several times a month ago, and I have received letters from various places asking about the treatment methods of diseases, etc. I should answer them in detail, but the author is not a white turbid expert, so I have given brief replies. I hope you will forgive me. Sincerely, Zhu Yanggao</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (II)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Given the startling number of deaths from tuberculosis as mentioned above, where does it actually occur in the body? We need to understand that the tuberculosis bacteria can invade almost any part of the body. However, the most common condition is pulmonary tuberculosis, which accounts for almost 90% of all tuberculosis cases. In addition, laryngeal tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis are also quite common; but these two are mostly complications of pulmonary tuberculosis, and the chances of them occurring independently are relatively small. If the tuberculosis bacteria enter the circulatory system, it will cause acute miliary tuberculosis, which is a type of acute infectious disease. The pleura and peritoneum in the internal organs are often affected; but there are also many obvious examples of involvement of the kidneys, urinary organs, mammary glands, thyroid gland, spleen, liver, and other areas. Furthermore, there are various types of tuberculosis that do not have a close relationship with pulmonary tuberculosis, such as skin tuberculosis, subcutaneous tissue tuberculosis, muscle tuberculosis, mucous bursa tuberculosis, lymphatic gland tuberculosis, bone tuberculosis, joint tuberculosis, tendon tuberculosis, and pancreatic tuberculosis. Among these, diseases like lupus vulgaris, coxitis, and Pott's disease are very important. These many types of tuberculosis will surely dazzle the readers; therefore, this article will temporarily focus solely on pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>In domestic publications, there are already several works on tuberculosis. However, some are intended for medical school textbooks or for reference; these often contain too many technical terms and the explanations are too profound. Naturally, ordinary people cannot understand them. There are also some popular pamphlets, but most of them focus on one aspect and rarely provide a comprehensive description. Articles published in newspapers are even more fragmented. I am well aware that my knowledge is insufficient, and this is written in my spare time, so it is difficult to review the original books one by one; but ordinary patients often lack even this basic knowledge. This kind of popular writing is therefore very much in demand. Therefore, I boldly submitted this article for publication in this journal.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a few more suggestions regarding popular medical writing to offer to the readers. I believe that doing this kind of writing does not simply mean briefly summarizing all the details of symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment listed in the original book; wouldn't that just become a "pocket clinical manual"? For example, in the symptoms of each disease, there are many terms that only need to be written in medical books for people to understand; but in popular writing, it is necessary to explain them in detail, no matter how tedious it may seem. In addition, matters such as medication, injections, and surgery mentioned in the treatment are matters for the doctors themselves; in popular writing, they should be omitted. Therefore, this brief discussion is not an abridged version of a complete book on pulmonary tuberculosis, nor is it an introduction to medical studies. It only hopes that readers will have a clear understanding of pulmonary tuberculosis, and that before getting sick, they will know the general principles of health maintenance, and after getting sick, they will not be overly alarmed and randomly take medicine, causing even common conditions to become incurable. This would be a great relief to the author.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 The Tuberculosis Bacteria</p>
<p>At the beginning of describing this disease, I think the readers may first want to ask: What exactly is the cause of this disease? This question cannot be resolved by non-scientific medicine. Among the people, there has always been a legend of "consumption worms"; and it is said that after the patient's death, the "consumption worms" come out from the throat, so it is very easy to get infected at this time. This statement seems superficially similar to the bacteria we talk about, but it has absolutely no basis in fact, and can only be heard but not seen. Therefore, it is impossible to talk about academic value. In the European medical community, people had long been researching pulmonary tuberculosis; but they could never answer the question of its cause. It was not until 1882, only fifty years ago, that the great German medical scientist Robert Koch discovered the tuberculosis bacteria, and this question finally had a satisfactory answer of "the truth coming to light."</p>
<p>The morphology of tuberculosis bacteria is a thin rod shape, hence it is also called tubercle bacillus. It is about 2.5 microns long (1 micron is one thousandth of a millimeter), which is about one-third of the diameter of a red blood cell. This state is completely different from the spiral shape of syphilis bacteria and the spherical shape of gonococci; but it is very similar to leprosy bacteria. It cannot move, and is covered with a fatty or waxy substance on the outside; therefore, its resistance is very strong. Several common disinfectants can be used as examples; such as 5% carbolic acid solution, which, if mixed with the sputum of this disease, will take more than 24 hours to kill it. The same goes for 5% or 10% Lysol solution. Ordinary mercuric chloride solution is even less effective. Formalin vapor disinfection is considered a very thorough method; but it is also helpless against tuberculosis bacteria in dried sputum. But it has one of the greatest enemies, which is the sunlight that everyone needs! Its resistance to it is very weak; under strong intensity, it almost dies upon exposure. But in dried dust or in places without sufficient sunlight, it can still maintain its life.</p>

<p>As for the driver Bing? In fact, he was just a substitute for A and B. If one of them wanted to rest, he would fill in; if it was driver A who needed a break, then the actual driving duties would be taken over by driver B, and the duties left behind by driver B would be taken over by driver C.</p>
<p>Next, let me talk about the situation of the firemen. There were four of them in total, wearing court hats and boots, and dressed in eunuch attire from beginning to end. Let me also represent them with A, B, C, and D. Fireman A was actually responsible for taking care of the fire. Fireman B, however, was idle and had nothing to do, until Fireman A needed a rest, and then he would go up to take over. Fireman C's job was to shovel the coal from the coal and water truck in the back to the front, so that Fireman A could take it and add it to the furnace. Fireman D was standing on top of the coal pile, using a short shovel to shovel the coal from the top to the bottom, so that Fireman C didn't have to exert much effort to transport the coal to Fireman A. But let us think about it: how awkward was the position of that Fireman D? He couldn't stand because the coal pile was too high, and the car was bumpy, wouldn't he fall down; he couldn't sit either, because this was against the Empress Dowager's orders. So what did he do? Of course, he could only squat down, half sitting and half standing. Therefore, his work was particularly slow, and he had to take care of his own safety at all times.</p>
<p>In this way, all the movements were performed according to the rituals of the palace. I think these people must have received several days of special training beforehand. I also went up to the locomotive to watch several times, and I only saw that those people all looked gloomy and unhappy. (17)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Theaters Sixty Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Qing Ban</p>
<p>Shanghai theaters originated in the late Tongzhi years of the former Qing Dynasty and have been around for more than sixty years. At that time, Dan Gui pioneered Peking Opera, followed by Shengping Xuan and Jingui Xuan, while Kun Opera had Yigui Xuan, followed by Shanya. However, their location was not in the concessions, but in Xiaodongmen. This is what those who study local history today should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Later, Baoxing on Jixiang Street in the French Concession was established, followed by Mantingfang on Baoshan Street, Fengle and Fuchun on Shilu in the British Concession. Juele and Tongle on Damalu were later establishments. Tianxian and Sanya came even later.</p>
<p>Among Peking Opera troupes, Jinxi Ban was the most famous, followed by Chun　Ban. Among Kun Opera troupes, Changzhou Daya Ban was famous, followed by Quanfu Ban. However, at that time, Peking Opera was popular, and Kun Opera gradually declined, which was a major divide in the history of opera. Famous performers included Liu Junxi, Sun Chunheng, Wang Zhaokui, Zhao Rongtang, etc. for beards; Wang Hongfu, Huang Yueshan, Zhou Changshan, etc. for martial roles; Li Lixiang, Du Dieyun, etc. for female roles; Chen Cailin, etc. for male roles from Shanxi; Tu Bianer and Gui Xiao for clowns. Guest performers included Chen Wanyou, who was the most promising. However, when Kun Opera troupes such as Yigui Xuan were performing, they often only listed the repertoire and did not indicate the names of the singers, so there are many omissions.</p>
<p>Yang Yuelou's beauty and artistry were unmatched at the time, and when he was affiliated with Dan Gui, a Cantonese man was very angry and sued him in the county. At that time, the county magistrate was Ye Guizhi, also a Cantonese. He interrogated him and used extreme torture, applying two hundred point hammers. Yang used a lot of money to avoid injury to his ankles, and the case was settled. He had to be conscripted into the army and sent four thousand miles away. At the time of the disbandment, it coincided with the 40th birthday of Empress Dowager Cixi, and he was pardoned. Therefore, the saying that Yang had "his head spared but his feet not spared" is also not factual.</p>
<p>The billiard room was on Simalu at the time. On the fourth night of the third month of Guiyou, it was an evening when famous Chinese and Western performers sang one after another, and Dan Gui's troupe was recruited. The audience gathered. At that time, the British consul was in attendance, wearing Manchurian Qing attire, with a plumed hat and a mandarin square. Chen Baoqu, the Secretary of the Mixed Court, went with Consul Mai Zheng, wearing a small hat and casual clothes. The contrast between the two was considered a spectacle.</p>
<h3>Hu Brushes</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>In the article "Japanese Brush Shops in Shanghai" before, I said that the Hu brushes of Shanlian, which are famous for their brushes and fine ink, are produced in Shanlian, a town in the area of Hu.</p>
<p>The entire town of Shanlian has hundreds of households, most of whom rely on making brushes for a living. Brush workshops are everywhere in the streets and alleys, facing each other. Some are picking hair, some are making brush heads, and some are trimming the tips and applying glue. Male and female workers are busy all day long. These many brush workshops range in scale from employing twenty or thirty workers to only two or three. They are mostly self-employed and make a living by themselves.</p>
<p>Speaking of business, it is really in a slump now! The sales of Hu brushes used to reach as far north as Liaoning and Jilin, as far west as Sichuan, and as far south as the South Seas islands. Not to mention the three major river basins of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Pearl River. The money flowing into this small town of Shanlian in a year was truly staggering, allowing the people of Shanlian to live a prosperous life. Now, the market is still the same as before, but the quantity sold has been greatly reduced. Although the entire town still has an income of 20,000 taels of silver a year, the average per household is less than 200 taels of silver. How can that be enough to feed a family of eight? Among them, several families like Shen Rusong have better products and larger transactions, but their expenses are also large, and they are still losing money.</p>
<p>The reason why the Hu brush business has declined from its former prosperity is undoubtedly that foreign fountain pens and pencils have occupied its territory. At this time, when promoting domestic goods, how can one not feel emotional when holding a brush?</p>

<h3>The Brand of the Times</h3>
<p>— Baozhi</p>
<p>In this current society where new and old ideas are intertwined, the marriage of young men and women is one of the most difficult problems to solve. We can often find in newspapers that XX has severed ties with their family because they oppose autocratic marriage, XX has committed suicide because marriage is not free, XX has fallen because they misunderstand free love. Are these ultimately the sins of the youth themselves, or the drive of the environment?</p>
<p>Looking at the film "Children of the Times," we can all understand this mystery.</p>
<p>"Children of the Times" is a new film recently directed by Mr. Li Pingqian of the Star Film Company. It adopts realistic themes and becomes an extraordinary work. The film narrates the lives of two pairs of men and women with different personalities, from student life to social life, and also incorporates the May Fourth Movement, showing a tortuous history of love. Some are moving forward, some are declining. The whole drama is great and tragic and can be said to be the brand of this era!</p>
<p>The cast includes Ms. Ai Xia, who committed suicide on New Year's Eve last year, as the protagonist of the film. (Co-starring Gao Qianping, Zhao Dan, Xu Xinwei, and Zhou Boxun) Ms. Ai was a rare talent in the Chinese film industry. Her death was really a loss to the Chinese film industry. Now that things are gone and people are dead, "Children of the Times" has become a source of sad remembrance.</p>

<p>You also added extra tofu and fresh cabbage, especially a lot for himself. Seeing the hot pot boiling and gurgling, he used his chopsticks to pick up two slices of cabbage and tasted them, feeling very delicious. So he took a cup and a tin pot of wine, sat down in front of the hot pot, and poured and drank by himself. His left hand pinched the small wine cup, and his right hand held the chopsticks, drinking and eating. He listened to the silence in the wilderness, which didn't seem like the New Year's Eve of previous years at all. Originally, at this time, Shanhaiguan had already fallen, North China was on alert, and the situation in Pingjin was very tense. The authorities issued a notice that setting off firecrackers and beating New Year's gongs and drums were not allowed during the New Year. This place in Haidian was too close to the Xiyuan military camp where the troops were stationed, so even a small firecracker was not allowed to be set off. The only ornament of this New Year's Eve was firecrackers. Without the sound of firecrackers, being alone with a solitary lamp, drinking until late at night, was naturally a different kind of realm. When Ji Zhi was drinking, he didn't pay much attention at first, but later, as the wine became stronger and the night grew deeper, he listened carefully outside the window. The elder brother and sister-in-law who were staying up on the upper floor had also gone to sleep. From near to far, only the not-so-strong northwest wind was passing through the sky, blowing the dry branches and making a rustling sound. Ji Zhi put down his cup and chopsticks, walked out of the room, and looked around in the yard. He only saw the sky dark and heavy, shrouded in the earth. Looking northwest, there were some dark and towering shadows in the haze, which were the Western Hills. After a long, long time, there were two distant barks of dogs. Ji Zhi felt that this New Year's Eve was too desolate. He walked into the room, no longer drank wine, propped his hands on the edge of the table, and stared blankly at the solitary lamp. He thought that he had only experienced such a desolate New Year's Eve since he was born. What was the reason for this? Was it a gift from the god of war? Even ants cherish their lives, so why do people have to fight? Why fight? It is also for some people to seek survival. But can't we survive without fighting? Driving a part of the people to sacrifice their survival, and seeking survival for another part of the people, isn't this a huge contradiction? (368)</p>

<h3>Research on Inkstones (20) (8)</h3>
<p>— Bored Guest</p>
<p>Other Famous Inkstones</p>
<p>The Song Dynasty Taolu and the current Taolu inkstones are extremely valuable because they are rarely seen in the world. Zou Shilu of Hangzhou was a famous inkstone enthusiast and connoisseur of Taolu inkstones at the time. His family had a Taolu inkstone carved with a bamboo forest and a flock of geese. His postscript reads:</p>
<p>The Song Dynasty carved Taolu green stone inkstone, the one owned by Wang Yintang, Prefect, is the most famous. Others such as Zhang Shuwei's Qingyige inscriptions, the two inkstones of Monk Fanlong of the Wenshu Yuan, and the inkstone of Guanyin and Arhat crossing the sea in the Guangcang Inkstone Record, are secondary. Wang's inkstone is carved with the Lanting Pavilion, while this one is carved with the bamboo forest, both stories of people from the Jin Dynasty. Wang's inkstone is carved with a flock of geese, while this one is carved with a flock of geese, seemingly from the same hand. However, the alternating yin and yang lines are even more exquisite. Wang's inkstone came from the Zhong family of Zhenze and was easily sold to the Japanese for a thousand gold. Five years ago, there was an earthquake in that country, and it is unknown whether it still exists. Last winter, I encountered this inkstone, which is even better than a round inkstone I obtained earlier. The Tao River is ominous, as seen in Cao Zhao's Gegu Yaolun and Zhao's Dongtian Qinglu of the Ming Dynasty. It was already valued in the Song Dynasty and was even considered priceless. How can I obtain stone to regard it as a treasure? Yi Yi, Shilu.</p>
<p>The so-called Taohé River being ominous probably refers to the idea of a commoner possessing a treasure leading to disaster. The ancients' emphasis on Taoshi can be imagined from this. Sakato's Inkstone Talk by the Japanese once recorded this matter, saying that the Japanese person mentioned in the text was Hejing. Later, Sakato, out of his love for inkstones, visited Shilu and accepted it, so this Taoshi inkstone is already owned by the Japanese. Sakato also said that there are only three or four Taoshi inkstones in the world, and inkstone enthusiasts in Shanghai have none of this kind. Because this stone was exhausted in the Song Dynasty, later ones are all counterfeited with other kinds of green stone, and they are not true Taolu. However, I think otherwise. Although the Taolu riverbed changed in the Song Dynasty, and the stone veins cannot be found again, it may be due to excavation at the intersection of old stone veins, or due to geographical relations, and the stone produced in the river, which is the same sedimentary rock, can be called New Taolu Green, and its moistness is no different from that of the old Taolu. There must also be no such thing. During my sixtieth birthday last year, my colleagues gave me two Taoyan inkstones as a gift. I was ashamed and grateful. One is rectangular, and the other is like an autumn leaf, about four inches long. The two inkstones are equal in size, and the stone is firm and delicate. There is a blue color on the green, and there are also tendon patterns like banana leaf white. The ink is like oil, and the elements of Taolu are all available, but its color seems to be not as ancient as the Song Dynasty. One is engraved with "The Second Best in the World," and the other is engraved with "Tranquility is the Body, so it is Eternal," and other clerical characters, and there are also seals such as the Qianlong imperial reward. The bottom cover is made of what is commonly known as Qiyang stone, which is purplish red, and the hollowed out parts are bright green. The carvings are extremely exquisite, and it is indeed a Qing Dynasty item. Another small inkstone of the Crown Prince is even more crystal clear than the previous two, warm like jade, with reddish-yellow tendons. It was originally an item from the Xiaolinglong Pavilion and was later stored in Xumanlu. Now it has also been obtained by a colleague and given as a gift. Although this inkstone is inscribed with Green Jade Song Taohé Stone Inkstone on the side, I dare not say for sure that it is a Song item. My younger brother Goufo likes book covers. In the Jiazi year, a friend from Min, Mr. Shen Hongkui, sent a Taolu inkstone from Taoyang, Longyou by way of service. The stone is dark blue in color and also has tendon patterns, and there is also yellow skin. The inkstone is made of stone cliff style, with an ancient plum branch next to it, which is quite elegant. There is a postscript on the back: "Those who ask about Taoyan inkstones all say that it is best to have yellow gall. Although this inkstone is recently produced, there is yellow gall on the edge, and the quality is not bad." Taoyang borders the Tao River on the left, and the inkstone is excavated by the locals in the river, but it is also occasional. It can be seen that the so-called Taolu Green Stone has indeed been produced after the Song Dynasty, and it is not necessarily the case that the Japanese said, that what you see is made of other stones.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>Review of the American Stock Market Panic</h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>㈠ I have repeatedly discussed the United States' securities control policies (see my articles in Issues 59 and 64 of this publication). To sum up these policies in one sentence, they are simply countermeasures against stock market panics. This is because in the American securities market, stocks occupy the most important position, while bonds are relatively scarce and insignificant. This is also one of the two distinctive features of the American securities market. In the previous two articles, although I repeatedly mentioned the decline in stock prices (stock market panic) as a dangerous precursor to economic panic, I only touched upon it briefly and did not have time to elaborate on the actual progression of events. The purpose of this article is to remedy this defect, gather materials, and focus specifically on describing the facts of the stock market panic, so that those who study the American securities investment system can gain a deeper understanding. The foundation of the securities market is built upon the dynamics of a country's national economy, and the fluctuations of the securities market serve as an indicator of changes in the entire national economic system. Therefore, our review of the American stock market panic is actually an observation of the progress of the country's economic panic at the same time.</p>
<p>㈡ The Great Panic of September 1929 marked the beginning of the collapse of the American stock market. Its characteristics were extreme price drops and a prolonged period of non-recovery, which was unprecedented. Tracing back to American securities history, the two panics of 1857 and 1893 were the most severe. However, although the price plunges at that time were shocking, the recovery was rapid, and the damage was relatively shallow. The clouds of post-war prosperity enveloped the golden kingdom of imperialism. When a stock market panic suddenly erupted in the spring of 1920, the impact was not insignificant. However, it is clear that it cannot be equated with the current panic. Now, the degree of its intensification is increasing day by day, and the decline in prices has broken previous records. If we try to examine the trend of the main stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, we can infer the general situation from one example. 丨丨丨</p>

<p>| Southern Pacific Railroad |  |  |  | 157.50 | 11.125 | 11.61 |</p>
<p>The fourteen major stocks on the New York Stock Exchange listed above are what American society commonly calls "blue-chip stocks." In other words, they are the most "popular" stocks in America today. Anyone who has studied the exchange market should know that the transaction price of American stocks is generally based on ten times the earning power. Comparing the highest prices in 1929 with the average earnings per share from 1928 to 1929, it is clear that many stocks were already higher than the standard. This is even more true for these blue-chip stocks. For example, Anaconda Copper stock was about twenty times higher, United States Steel stock was about fifteen times higher, General Motors was eighteen times higher, Sears, Roebuck was thirty-one times higher, and New York Central Railroad stock was eighteen times higher, all of which were extremely high. DuPont Chemical stock, at thirty-eight times higher, was the leader among them. In short, the time before the 1929 panic was the peak of stock prices.</p>
<p>Those who have studied business cycle fluctuations know that when a market's credit is extremely developed and prices (including stock prices) are extremely high, it is nothing less than a harbinger of economic panic. Looking at the American stock market, one can believe that this statement is true. The reactive force is proportional to the positive force. The higher the stock price, the more violent the downward trend. The highest record was created in 1929, and when the panic erupted, prices plummeted and could not be contained. The lowest record was created in 1933. Comparing the two, it is not surprising that some stocks fell to one-tenth of their value. There were even some that fell to one-twentieth or one-thirtieth, and the most extreme ones plummeted to one-hundredth! For example, Goodyear, Southern Pacific, Sears Roebuck, and Baltimore and Ohio in the table above fell to one-fifteenth or one-twentieth of their value. The stock that fell to one-hundredth of its value was Miller's Railroad stock.</p>
<p>Judging from the earnings of various companies, the extent of the stock price crash last year was unprecedented. In the past economic panic surges, when the reaction was most rapid, it would inevitably lead to a reaction to the reaction, and stock prices would rise. Now, however, the downward trend is endless, and it was not until the lower mid-term of last year that it began to stabilize slightly. From September 1929 to that time, it lasted about three and a half years. The lowest prices last year were even lower than the earnings.</p>
<p>When Roosevelt took office last March, he was determined to revive the financial system. As a result of the implementation of the Federal Securities Act of 1933 in May of the same year, the business and financial sectors gradually showed signs of improvement. If we compare the New York Stock Exchange prices reported in the securities section of various international business telegrams with the table above, we can see that the closing price of DuPont Chemical on the tenth of this month had reached 97.75, which is 66.625 higher than the lowest price last year. General Motors also rose to 38.875, which is 28.1875 higher than last year. New York Central Railroad was 36.625, an increase of 22.625. (According to the daily newspaper, only Hudson Railroad, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Southern Pacific Railroad, and other stocks have not improved.</p>
<p>㈢ Why did American stock prices unanimously experience an unprecedented plunge? Moreover, the period of the plunge lasted for several years without weakening. If we want to understand the reason, it is necessary to describe the state of the American business world before the stock market panic. As we have repeatedly mentioned, the stock market is based on the business sector. To sum up the great stock market crash of 1929 in one sentence, it was a reaction to the abnormal development of the American business sector from 1921 to 1929. Therefore, the inherent contradiction of capitalism, which is to engage in rational production but make irrational distribution, led to an imbalance between production and consumption, as well as an imbalance between one business and another. The foundation of the economic panic was laid upon this.</p>
<p>When President Hoover was in power, the American business community experienced a rapid expansion of production and a rapid increase in exports due to the widespread application of machinery and the implementation of scientific management. Therefore, domestic scholars sang the praises of permanent prosperity and regarded the theory of economic cycles as outdated. President Hoover advocated it from above, and businessmen promoted it from below. Production was greatly expanded, and the amount of new capital issued and import and export trade increased day by day. It was truly a golden age.</p>

<p>Based on American Exporter, P.16, Feb. 34</p>
<p>America's foreign trade increased year by year from 1921, reaching its peak in 1929. The total trade volume was more than 9.64 billion dollars, of which exports accounted for more than 5.24 billion dollars. Although there is solid evidence to cite for the surge in domestic sales, the expansion of credit and the growth of people's purchasing power at that time also expanded the domestic market. Since 1930, it has reversed its old state and continued to decline. The most important reason is nothing more than the sharp reduction in exports to Europe. European countries needed a large amount of American machinery and steel to seek the restoration of post-war industry, and even agricultural products were mostly supplied by the United States. However, once the European countries' production enterprises returned to their old state, they would no longer need to purchase goods from the United States. This is one reason. In recent years, the idea of "Autarchy" has swept across countries, and European countries in particular have made efforts to lay the foundation of their national economies, using tariffs, exchange rates, currency belts and other measures to prevent the import of foreign goods. This is the second. The world economic panic is becoming increasingly profound, and the purchasing power of people in various countries is declining. This is the third. In short, the dream of America's permanent prosperity at that time was awakened. All that could be seen were factory inventories piled up like mountains, difficult to clear, factory closures, labor unrest, political disputes, and the lower the purchasing power of the domestic people, the lower the prices of goods and stock prices. The sluggishness of this trade is obviously a problem of global purchasing power, which cannot be solved by a trade bank established by the United States.</p>
<p>During the same period, there were also major changes in the amount of new capital issued in the United States. If readers scrutinize it carefully, they can get a glimpse of the expansion of American enterprises.</p>
<p>Amount of New Capital Issued in the United States (in millions of dollars)</p>
<p>| Year | Total Amount | New Capital | Amount Invested in Foreign Countries |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 1921 | 4,203.8 | 3,576.7 | 627.1 |</p>
<p>| 1923 | 4,989.7 | 4,304.4 | 685.5 |</p>
<p>| 1925 | 7,126.0 | 6,220.2 | 905.9 |</p>
<p>| 1927 | 9,933.7 | 7,791.1 | 2,142.6 |</p>
<p>| 1929 | 11,592.2 | 10,182.8 | 1,409.4 |</p>
<p>| 1930 | 7,677.0 | 7,023.4 | 653.7 |</p>
<p>| 1931 | 4,022.9 | 3,115.5 | 907.4 |</p>
<p>| 1932 | 1,721.4 | 1,191.0 | 530.4 |</p>
<p>Based on The Index, Published by n.y. Trust Co. Feb., 34</p>
<p>In 1929, at the peak of prosperity, the total amount of new capital issued was more than 11.592 billion dollars. After deducting 1.4 billion dollars invested overseas, the amount invested in new uses was enormous. The following year, it gradually decreased to 7.677 billion dollars. In 1932, it was only 1.72 billion dollars, only about 16% of the highest amount. The sharp decrease in new investment, to put it simply, was due to the impact of a reduction in a country's financial resources.</p>
<p>The decline in foreign trade, the reduction in domestic purchasing power, and the reduction in capital directly affect the profits of various enterprises and indirectly determine the price of stocks. The more transactions, the greater the profits, and the market price of stock capital always rises and falls in direct proportion to this profit.</p>

<p>| Total | 3,347 | 2,359 | 1,480 | 788 |</p>
<p>According to the numbers listed in the Commercial and Financial Chronicle on February 25, the net profit of American enterprises reached 3.347 billion dollars in 1929. After that, it gradually decreased. In 1932, it was 788 million dollars, only about 24% of the highest record. Judging from individual businesses, except for public utilities (public utility stocks) and railroad businesses (railroad stocks) that were fortunate enough to obtain meager profits, the rest were losses. The general business companies (industrial stocks) as a whole had a loss of 30 million dollars. Among them, the automobile industry lost 50 million dollars, and the steel industry lost 120 million dollars. The tragic situation can be imagined. As for the situation in 1933, although there are currently no accurate statistics published that can be cited as evidence, based on the above tables, it is sufficient to know that it was even more depressed.</p>
<p>㈣ Among the American business community, public utilities such as electricity, water, gas, and telephones, and railroad companies have the strongest foundation and receive the most profits each year. However, judging from the above table, the business situation of these railroad companies is also getting worse year by year. Upon examination of the reasons, it is due to the abnormal development of the automobile industry. Although the American automobile industry only has a 30-year history, it has become one of the world's largest enterprises. It is easy to imagine that it has encroached upon the territory of railroad companies. Currently, there are 20 million automobiles in the United States for passenger use and 7 million for freight transportation, totaling 27 million vehicles. This huge number is enough to startle the shareholders of railroad companies. The most important thing is that the debt of railroad companies has recently increased sharply. Since 1931, the total amount of loans borrowed by railroad companies has been 13 billion dollars. According to the total assets of the railroad, which is only about 24 billion dollars, the debt has reached half of the assets. The interest burden is increasing day by day, and the net profit obtained is decreasing day by day. Therefore, although railroad stocks are fortunate to have improved recently, they will eventually come to the same end.</p>
<p>The development of the automobile industry relies on devouring railroads to enrich itself, which has led to the decline of railroad stocks, as we have already mentioned above. However, the arrival of the economic panic did not exclusively benefit this industry, and the price fluctuations of the stocks of automobile companies were also the most severe. The year 1929 was a turning point for the automobile industry. The net profit obtained in the same year reached 357 million dollars. By 1932, not only was there no profit, but there was a huge loss of 50 million dollars. The business situation last year can be seen from the words of the automobile king. He once said to others: "Personally, I estimate that I lost 50 US dollars for every new car last year." No wonder this big businessman, who eats thousands of dollars a day, is extremely indignant at Roosevelt and has many criticisms of the Industrial Recovery Act and other road facilities.</p>
<p>The plunge in steel and iron stocks is no less severe than that of railroad and automobile stocks. Among them, Anaconda Steel and United States Steel were the worst. The former's highest price in 1929 was 140 dollars, and its lowest price in 1933 was 4.125 dollars, a drop of 34 times. Steel stocks also fell from 261.75 dollars to 23.375 dollars. Looking at the profit side, the entire steel industry made a profit of 320 million dollars in 1929, while in 1932 there was a loss of 120 million dollars. In terms of production, the total amount of cast iron and steel produced in 1929 was 93.19 million tons, while in 1932 it was 22 million tons, a decrease of about 76%. The amount of steel produced in 1929 was 3.02 billion pounds, while in 1932 it was only 510 million pounds, a decrease of about a quarter.</p>
<p>Finally, we still need to briefly mention the stocks of public utility companies (public utility stocks). Among the American business community, this was originally considered to have the most solid foundation, but the result of the changes in its stock prices was also extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Public utility stocks include telegraph, telephone, tap water, gas, and electricity. Due to special relationships, the net profit each year is still good. In 1932, it was 486 million dollars, a decrease of about 200 million dollars compared to 1929. As for the stock prices, they all had a downward trend. Taking Unified Gas stock as an example, it was 183.25 dollars in 1929 and fell to 34 dollars last year. American Telegraph and Telephone stock also fell from 232.50 dollars to 70.25 dollars. The same is true for other stocks.</p>
<p>㈤ In the second and third paragraphs, we conducted a comprehensive study of the rise and fall of stock prices. In the fourth paragraph, we painstakingly studied the actual situation of various enterprises and their impact on stock prices. We have a clear understanding of the tragic fall of American stock prices. Therefore, our conclusion is that the tragic fall of stock prices is not due to the stock itself, but the entire national economy should be held responsible. Since the Securities Act was implemented in 1933, stock prices have improved a lot, as mentioned in the second paragraph. However, the Securities Speculation Prohibition or Exchange Management Act of 1934 has some defects of being too hasty and is inconsistent with the actual situation in both theory and practice, as I have said before. According to recent telegrams, this bill has been revised a lot, and it is not known whether it will be as effective as the 1933 bill in the future. We say again that the revival of the stock market depends on the revival of industry, and the policy of controlling securities is a last resort.</p>
<h3>A Retrospective on American Factory Profits and Losses in 1933</h3>
<p>— Pan Wenan</p>
<p>The United States, hailed as the kingdom of the gold standard, has been in the depths of panic since 1929, with industry and commerce declining year after year. Exhausted, Americans dream daily of a turnaround. After President Roosevelt took office last year, he implemented the Blue Eagle movement, hoping to use political control of industry and commerce to revive the American economy. This great experiment gave the world a lot of excitement. If the experiment succeeded, it would prove that capitalism had not reached its end and could still use controlled policies to mitigate internal contradictions. Therefore, the success or failure of this first experiment is something the world is eager to know. At the same time, because economic prosperity and decline are most evident in the industrial sector, examining the profits and losses of American factories in the past year can roughly reveal the results of this experiment. The following is an examination of the annual business settlements of 810 American factories. The total net value is US$14,003,000,000, and the total net profit is US$441,000,000 (in 1932, the net loss was US$46,000,000). Compared with the past, it cannot be said that there has been no considerable progress. The detailed figures are listed in the table below:</p>

<p>Note: C indicates a loss</p>
<p>In summary, of the 37 industries listed in the table above, 11 industries originally made profits in 1932, and in 1933, their profits increased further. Most of these industries are engaged in the manufacture of consumer goods, such as candy, food and beverages, shoes, chain stores, paints, and oils. Other industries, such as chemical manufacturers, continued to profit during the economic panic of the past few years, and this trend continued into 1933.  The remaining industries, including cotton, wool, and silk textiles, department stores, wholesale stores, automobiles, tires, etc., 12 in total, saw their profits turn into losses in 1933.  Steel transport, telephone, railway, automobile, building materials, recreational equipment, and other eight industries saw their losses in 1933 smaller than the previous year. Therefore, in summary, the business conditions of various industries in 1933 show that 31 industries improved compared with the previous year.  However, the conditions for industries such as the packaging of small bags, pharmaceuticals, and printing and publishing deteriorated, due to reduced business or falling market prices, resulting in lower incomes. The factories that made profits accounted for 40% of the total in 1932, and this increased to 62% in 1933.  After looking at these figures, it seems that after the extreme decline of the American economy in 1932, there were signs of recovery in 1933. However, the average rate of return of the factories in the table above as a percentage of the total net value is only 3.1%, a rate of return even lower than the interest rate of the American Reserve Bank, and it seems insufficient to attract capital to invest in the revitalization of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Reasons for Increased Profits</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the increase in the rate of return of American manufacturing factories in 1933 was the gradual rise in prices. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the index of 784 commodities, raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products at the end of 1933 rose by 14% compared with the beginning of the year. According to Moody's, the price index of 15 raw materials rose by 57%. Because rising prices stimulated sales, profits increased, and the valuation of inventory did not have to be underestimated too much. This situation was, of course, beneficial to industry and commerce. Several manufacturers also benefited greatly from the fall in exchange rates and the increase in the value of foreign inventories and investments. Because if the value of goods stored abroad and foreign investments is converted at the devalued dollar rate, it will certainly exceed the original price by a considerable amount.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers also reduced and amortized the book value of fixed assets and old or discarded equipment, and proportionally reduced share capital or public reserves, which could save a lot on depreciation and other indirect costs. Since turnover has been reduced, the resulting profits will of course appear relatively larger. Looking at the table above, between January 1932 and January 1933, as a result of various factories writing off losses and capital, the total net value decreased by about US$1,100,000,000. Recently, the net value of many factories is only slightly less than half of what it was in 1929. Since the calculation of profits is based on the amount of capital, a reduction in the amount of capital is enough to show a relative increase in profits. This point must be taken into account. The efforts of various factories to reduce costs, tighten expenses, improve efficiency, improve machinery, and promote new product markets also contributed to the increase in profits.</p>
<p>Obstacles to Profit Growth</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the Blue Eagle Movement in the United States, working hours have been shortened, wages have been increased, and raw material prices have risen, making factory costs heavier than before. Therefore, despite the several advantages mentioned above, profits still cannot be fully increased. The rate of return of ordinary factories was already very low, and the increase in costs was naturally difficult to maintain, so they had to pass it on to consumers. If the selling price increases too quickly, or if its extent exceeds the increase in purchasing power, then there will be [] will [].</p>
<p>Price [] 's [] inventory [] increase, [] one hundred manufacturers of inventory, in 1933 than the previous year increased by 28%, according to the source of funds, mostly from the sale of government bonds and its [] votes.</p>
<p>The above two factors are secondary. The most important factor is the [] of donations and taxes from the central, state, and local governments. Manufacturers are deeply resentful of this. This situation is similar to that of Chinese merchants who are trapped by exorbitant taxes. In fact, the increase in government expenditure should also be fully considered in advance. If there is a real recovery and economic recovery, then we should do our best to protect industry and commerce; otherwise, if we spend extravagantly and abuse our power, and everything becomes the old burden on the people, then the effect of recovery will not be seen, and the social economy will be devastated before it can be achieved.</p>

<h3>Commercial News: Finance: Call Loan Rates Remain the Same During Holiday; Subsidiary Coins Fluctuate</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks and foreign firms were closed as usual, so the market was even more quiet. Although money shops were still open as usual, there were no counterparties for activities, so trading was almost completely at a standstill. Although there were one or two ins and outs, they were the closing of the money shops' own procedures and were not enough to represent the market. The call loan rate in the market remained at 5% in the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day. Call loan transactions were also greatly reduced compared with previous days. The transfer volume in the morning market was more than 3.7 million, and new transactions were only more than 200,000. The transaction volume in the afternoon market was also more than 200,000. The transaction volume in the small general meeting was more than 400,000. Pawn transactions amounted to more than 200,000 in redemptions and more than 500,000 in new transactions. Money shops collected and remitted more than 29 million in foreign public bills, 300,000 in remittances from various routes, and 300,000 to the interior from guest routes. In the early market, Jiangnan small silver dollars were 838 yuan, and in the afternoon market, they rose by 2 yuan, resulting in a net increase of 1.5 yuan compared with the previous day.

<h3>Securities: Shanghai Market Curve Downward</h3>
<p>From April 16th to 21st, the public debt market price of the Shanghai Securities Exchange fluctuated. Immediately after the incident in North China, the Huang clan initially moved from Ping to, from, and then to Shanghai, giving up their escape. There was hope for peace. Later, the Southwest suddenly expressed opposition to this, and their attitude gradually became tougher. In the end, Japan's Asian Monroe Doctrine caused anxiety among the world's powers and may lead to domestic and international eastern []. The public price market is approaching a crucial moment. Because the effect of transaction is huge, it is also following the trend, and the ups and downs are also uncertain. The market price is declining in a curve. On Tuesday, there was considerable hope for resolving the diplomatic problem. Various gangs entered the stomach [], and numbers 11, 35, and 48 were extremely short, and the upward trend was very strong. The front-month disarmament rose sharply by one yuan, and the gold futures also rose sharply by one yuan and two jiao. After that, the two subsequent markets were slightly smaller, but the interest rate rose by about one yuan. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, there was a slight sense of chaos, and the bulls and bears were slightly deadlocked. However, the number 53 entered a large number of disarmament, and the other items were mostly Fei Tian. Number 46's exit of 96 and the entry of 22 years of customs duties were quite noteworthy. Market prices showed mixed ups and downs. On Thursday, the Southwest issued a telegram with a tough attitude, and there was a slight short squeeze in the market. However, number 53 still entered a large amount of disarmament, and market prices mostly returned to the half-yuan range. On Friday, the North Gang's selling was still huge, and number 53 re-entered disarmament, and market prices continued to weaken slightly, about three or four jiao. However, due to swap relationships, the ups and downs varied slightly. On Saturday, the international community had a strong stance against Japan, and the atmosphere was not good, and there was a continued short squeeze. Market conditions continued to weaken. Number 53 entered disarmament, and there was no sign of satisfaction. Summarizing the overall situation of the week, because large households were covering their heads without swapping, market prices failed to overcome the environment, and the trend was hovering downward. People's hearts were no longer as excited as the previous week. However, number 53's continuous daily purchases of disarmament attracted speculation in the market. The settlement date for this month has been set for the 27th. There are only two days left for this month's futures, Monday and Tuesday. The environmental situation is temporarily unable to []. Market prices will be bound by this and will not be able to develop. The results of the week's market prices show a decline of two or three jiao to seven or eight jiao. The 96 fell by one yuan and two jiao to one yuan and seven jiao. Only disarmament rose by eight jiao to one yuan and two jiao, and gold futures also rose by about half a yuan. This abnormal development and reaction will have to wait for the future. The total transaction volume was 111,056,600 yuan, including 11,000 yuan in spot goods and 111,055,500 yuan in futures. The results of the week's market prices, comparing the ups and downs, are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: American Cotton Stagnant and Lacking Features</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton market was sluggish and lacked features. Industry peers adopted a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 pounds/tone, and futures prices fell by 2 pounds/tone to 4 pounds/tone. Liverpool cotton spot prices did not change, and futures prices rose by 5 to 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 7 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to long liquidation, but later rebounded due to purchases by European exporters. As a result, prices rose by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is as follows (telegram from the 21st):</p>

<h3>Food: River Bottom Rice Shows Soft Characteristics</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source of goods is only near the 30th (more than 5,000 shi). The customer gang's booking intention reappeared weak, and late rice immediately showed a soft color. Fortunately, gangs from Nanyang, Xiamen, and Fuzhou showed interest in Zhongguan goods, and the sellers took the opportunity to tighten the price. Until the close of the market, it felt tight. Statistics showed 1,340 packages of Zhongguan goods from Qijiaofeng, Lianxi, and Xishan. The market price remained at the old level. As for goods from large markets such as Qisi, the Beiyang gang stopped taking action, so they all failed to open. Only [another word] was moved. Due to the torrential rain, few customers visited the market for various thick geng varieties, so there were few transactions. In addition, there were more goods arriving, so it was inevitable that the market would continue to weaken. Therefore, goods such as Changbang Suwen Nangang depreciated by three to five cents. Du Yangjian goods lacked stomach fragrance, but showed a unique color. The path for Yinyuan was still broad, and it was also able to tighten the market. Bianyuan did not show any honor or disgrace.</p>

<h3>Liquidation of the North China Problem</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The situation in North China has suddenly become serious again. In the past few days, the atmosphere between China and Japan has become extremely tense. Based on observations from various sources, Japan may once again perpetrate a reckless act of aggression in North China. If our country does not handle this situation well in the future, the result will inevitably be that we fall into the trap of malicious individuals.</p>
<p>Since the Tanggu Truce was concluded, the situation in North China, although temporarily presenting an appearance of stability, has actually harbored many complex and deeply rooted disasters. The negotiations for the handover of war zones, the occupation of Dolon Nor, and the disturbances by puppet troops are all manifestations of these disasters. Moreover, Japan's plot to invade our country has always adhered to a consistent plan, seemingly not stopping until it reaches its ultimate goal. Therefore, after the end of the war, they continued to actively pursue political and military objectives. In the political arena, they constantly made various unreasonable demands on our country. In the military field, they continued to increase their troop strength. Recently, they even dispatched a large number of officers to various regions to inspect and survey the key passes and fortresses of the Great Wall, intensifying their military deployments. Judging from their activities, even if they do not yet have the ambition to annex North China, they will undoubtedly coerce our country into recognizing the puppet organizations.</p>
<p>Whether Japan has the courage at this moment to directly deploy troops to press on Beijing and Tianjin and throw another bomb on the international stage depends on how future developments unfold. However, the current Japan is in an extremely difficult situation internationally. Relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are deteriorating daily, and war could break out at any moment. With regard to Britain, it is difficult to revive the hope of an Anglo-Japanese alliance, and with regard to the United States, there is no guarantee of genuine amity and cooperation. In the current situation, the attitudes taken by various countries in the world may not be genuinely beneficial to Japan. In order to overcome this predicament, Japan believes that it has no way out except to coerce China into recognizing the puppet organizations. Therefore, they now seem to be striving to achieve this goal. Once the Sino-Japanese problem is resolved, Japan can obtain the following benefits: (1) Once China takes the lead in recognizing the puppet state, all countries in the world will follow suit. (2) The economy of Manchukuo can develop towards North China. (3) Japan can concentrate its forces to deal with Russia. (4) There will be no debate over the Manchurian problem at the next naval conference. (5) Japan's strength in the international arena can be enhanced. (6) The whole of China will inevitably be under Japan's control.</p>
<p>How to make China recognize "Manchukuo" is a problem that Japan urgently needs to consider now. They know that in the current situation, the time is not yet ripe for our government to directly recognize the puppet Manchukuo. But if they do not get China's recognition, they themselves have no way out. Therefore, the cunning Japanese came up with a way to liquidate the North China problem. They believe that once the North China problem is resolved, all difficulties can be overcome. The first step in their liquidation of North China is to urge our country to negotiate on issues such as opening up transportation and postal services, as well as establishing customs posts.</p>
<p>The negotiations on issues such as opening up transportation and postal services and establishing customs posts were noisy for a while in the past. Until recently, these issues have expanded from brewing. Although our authorities have consistently and firmly denied these negotiations, it can be asserted that Japan will definitely achieve its goals, based on the news from various sources.</p>
<p>In our observation, the reason why the crisis in North China has taken a sharp turn for the worse today is, in the final analysis, that Japan wants to take this opportunity to coerce our authorities into accepting a treaty of surrender, so that China cannot but open up transportation and postal services and establish mutual customs posts with the puppet state, becoming a de facto disguised recognition. For the sake of the present, our authorities should immediately reject this sternly. If our country succumbs to power and tolerates it against its will, Japan will naturally be satisfied, but it will be a fatal wound to our country. Not to mention that there will never be any hope of recovering the lost territory in the East Provinces, and the sympathy of the international community will also be completely abandoned by us. The future disasters are simply unimaginable!</p>
<p>However, the situation in North China is now extremely urgent due to Japan's intimidation and threats. If our country resolutely rejects Japan's demands, the situation in North China in the future will inevitably become more fierce due to Japan's intensified reckless actions. How should this be dealt with? This really depends on the awakening of our people and the making of the greatest determination. Otherwise, not only will the North China problem be impossible to solve, but the entire China will also be plunged into a desperate and dangerous situation!</p>

<h3>Talking About Quitting Smoking Again</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>I can't remember which year I developed the habit of smoking, because smoking was not prohibited in the school I studied in. Teachers and students with strong feelings often smoked and talked in the bedroom. In this environment, I went from trying it out to being ignorant. However, smoking at this time seemed to have a bit of a fashionable quality. When meeting a friend, offering a cigarette to the guest and taking one for oneself, and then talking and playing, it felt like being full of energy. In fact, I don't think smoking cigarettes is so addictive that you can't stop.</p>
<p>Some people often stick to one brand of cigarettes. Smoking Chesterfields is of course vanity, smoking British-made cigarettes is old school, but some people only smoke Mei Li or White Golden Dragon and resolutely don't smoke other cigarettes, which I think is too unreasonable. I smoke any cigarette, as long as it doesn't hurt my throat. When I have money, I smoke White Tin Box; when I'm broke, I still smoke a pack of Pyramids a day.</p>
<p>Speaking of quitting smoking, I think every smoker has made a vow once or many times, but the result is still smoking again. In this case, cigarettes seem to be addictive too; and it gives opium smokers an excuse, since they can't even quit cigarettes, there's no way they can quit opium. According to my experience, it's best to quit smoking after being sick. When a person is sick, they often smell a strange and unpleasant odor when smoking, so I don't smoke when I'm sick. Sometimes I can detect the odor when smoking and determine that I'm going to get sick. I've used this opportunity to quit smoking too many times, but unfortunately, I don't have the determination. When I pass a cigarette shop or see someone else smoking, I'm eager to try it again.</p>
<h3>University Election</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>"No way, we're at too much of a disadvantage; if they only give us two votes, we definitely won't attend. Let's see how their committee is formed."</p>
<p>"That's right, we won't attend the vote, that's the most effective way to resist."</p>
<p>"Even if this meeting falls through, we have to persevere to the end!"</p>
<p>"Little Wang is too ambitious. He wants to take over the student union. What a bastard! He can show off on the playing field, but don't think he can suppress us! We won't lose this one!"</p>
<p>"No matter what, out of the seven committee members, we have to be elected at least four. You have to know, we've already given up three positions, and we can't give up any more!"</p>
<p>"Just based on our historical position and relationship, those brats shouldn't be competing with us for committee seats. It's outrageous. Are they blind?"</p>
<p>"However, since they're prepared to come forward and compete with us, they probably have someone backing them. At the very least, they must have been instigated by someone. As the saying goes, those who come are not kind. We should discuss concrete and effective countermeasures, otherwise, even if we underestimate them or don't prepare early, it will be too late if we fall into their trap!"</p>
<p>"Old Li's words are mature and experienced, we should immediately discuss countermeasures. In my opinion, we should immediately jointly and solicit endorsements from our classmates to send a letter to the Training Department, saying that they were instructed by so-and-so to try to control the student union and use it for propaganda activities. The Training Department will definitely give them a strong warning when they receive this report. At that time, we can also publicize to the new classmates who are rooting for them, saying that the school authorities and local police authorities are paying attention to them and telling them to be careful not to be innocently implicated. After they suffer this blow, let's see what energy they have left!"</p>
<p>"I don't agree, I don't agree! We have to do it the hard way! Old Pan's plan is ingenious, but it's not what heroes do, and the circle is too big, too many people are involved, and it's not economical in time, it's too troublesome. Furthermore, there's no guarantee that the Training Department will be used by us. If it doesn't work and they find out, it will give them a handle for counter-propaganda, then we'll suffer a lot! Old Pan, don't you think so? So, this won't work. I think Zhang Tianyi's words can be done, but we should first give them a warning, and then send someone to smooth things over. If they don't listen, then we'll beat them until they bleed. Wouldn't that be great? Don't worry, the committee will always be ours."</p>
<p>In a south-facing dormitory on the third floor, seven or eight young people were sitting or lying on two beds. College students in small hats, slippers, and suits without ties were discussing the student union election next week. Some were jumping and making noise angrily, some were silently thinking about effective countermeasures, some were clenching their right fists and hitting the palms of their left hands desperately, and making punching gestures, while others were whistling small tunes, calm as if nothing had happened—in short, they were yelling chaotically, you a sentence, me a mouth, so this small room was indeed immersed in a lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>The date of the general election finally arrived; Zhang Tianyi's warning to their enemies unexpectedly received a strong reply and became an open fact. A group of carefree and leisurely young men were happily waiting to see the excitement, and some of the more timid ones had asked for sick leave to go home and escape, fearing that the disaster would come to them; the principal's office probably knew the seriousness of the matter, but only issued a notice that didn't hurt or itch much, calling on students to uphold the spirit of the rule of law. —Later, it was said that the principal avoided being on campus five minutes before the meeting because he was afraid that the disaster would come to him.</p>
<p>The election was completed amidst laughter and scolding; the results of the vote count showed that Zhang Tianyi's side suffered an unexpected and unprecedented defeat. But while Xiao Wang's faction was shouting victory slogans and singing, ink boxes, brick pieces, stones, and paper balls all flew onto the stage, followed by majestic and sharp shouts of fighting, and the new committee member Xiao Wang and his group slipped away in the chaos.</p>
<p>After Zhang Tianyi's group chased out of the auditorium, the people watching the excitement also dispersed. The auditorium was filled with overturned chairs and red and green election tickets scattered on the floor.</p>
<h3>The Tale of the Street Urchin (26)</h3>
<p>— Made by Chen Jingsheng</p>
<p>Charge! This kind of hatred is etched in the bones! Only those who have never had a gun or knife held to their necks would forget this kind of hatred!</p>
<h3>"Just Playing Around"</h3>
<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>Thirty-year-old woman Yao Lifen sued sixty-seven-year-old old man Pang Chunshan for abandonment after cohabitation, seeking support in court. The defendant's lawyer argued on behalf of the defendant, saying that when the defendant met the plaintiff, it was only for fun, and there was absolutely no marital relationship. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that since the defendant regarded the plaintiff as a plaything, it was evident that he had now abandoned her because he was tired of playing with her. This behavior was a disregard for women.</p>
<p>"Just playing around," in today's society, there are indeed many men who hold this attitude towards women. The fate of women is truly unfortunate. In the feudal era, they were attached to men and were in a state of male servitude; descending to today's capitalist era, the status of women has changed from slaves to commodities. Capitalist society values money most. With money, you can do whatever you want. The price of a commodity is money, which can be used to exchange it. Since women have become commodities, as long as you have money, you can buy them. A commodity exchanged for money is the property of the buyer; if it is broken, it can be thrown away or replaced with a new one, as the owner sees fit. A woman obtained with money is the owner's property; if he is tired of playing with her, he can abandon her or take another one he likes. The owner naturally has the right to dispose of her. In this situation, women become men's playthings.</p>
<p>However, this is not only the fault of men. Women must also bear some responsibility. In today's society, aren't there many women who are prepared to be played with by men? Prostitutes who present their naked bodies to those who vent their desires are clearly going to be played with; but we cannot bear to blame them, because they sacrifice their beauty to make a living, driven by a cruel life, and it is not their wish. What we want to scold are those women who are full of vanity. Nowadays, ordinary vain women are often unable to resist the temptation of material life and are willing to provide their entire bodies for men to play with at will in order to satisfy their desires for material enjoyment. These women are mostly worshippers of money; as long as men have money to spend on them, as long as men can satisfy all their vanity, they are willing to sell their bodies, whether retail or wholesale. They simply trade their bodies for money. They always dress very coquettishly, waiting for people to play with them. Don't say that men seduce them, they sometimes even bewitch men.</p>
<p>Take the Yao-Pang case as an example. Pang Chunshan was already an old man with a wife and children; when he took a fancy to Yao Lifen and wanted to take her as a mistress, he undoubtedly had the ambition of "just playing around"; now that they have been together for ten years, he suddenly abandoned her like a worn-out shoe, which is even more obviously the result of being tired of playing with her. To say that this behavior is an insult to women is not an exaggeration. As for Yao Lifen, she was still a nineteen-year-old girl at the time, while Pang Chunshan was already an old man in his fifties; it is really hard for us to believe that she willingly committed herself to the matter and cohabited without being tempted by any vanity. Because we dare to assert that if Pang were not a rich man, Ms. Yao would never have been willing to be with him.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the personal issues; from another point of view, there are social reasons for men to regard women as playthings. The current society is a male-dominated society, and all the special rights in society are in the hands of men; the status of women is lower than that of men, and the lives of women must rely on the support of men; thus, women cannot but become men's playthings. Therefore, if women do not want to regain their own status and personality, then so be it; if they want to regain their own status and personality, then the only way out is to overthrow the male-dominated society and create a society where men and women have equal rights!</p>
<h3>Night Return</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to the host and leaving the happy family, it was already midnight. The street lights were dim, and it seemed that the misty eyes could not catch the characters in the distance. I shouted loudly for a rickshaw twice, as if my own echo came from the valley. This echo was particularly clear. I deliberately raised my voice again and shouted, and I laughed at myself.</p>
<p>I like to take a walk alone on a quiet road when it's drizzling, reciting Dai Shutang's Rain Alley: "Holding a paper umbrella, wandering alone in a long, long, lonely rain alley, I hope to meet a girl like a lilac, with a sad resentment. She quietly approaches, approaches, and casts a Taizhi-like gaze. She floats by like a dream; like a dream, sadly blurred." Of course, you don't have to meet such a lilac girl. When reciting that poem, it seems that the outline of a sad and resentful girl has passed before your eyes.</p>
<p>So, listening to the sound of my own heavy footsteps, I walked home in the mist. The music and singing in the house seemed to match the rhythm of my steps. I deliberately took a long way, carefully walking as if precious youth was about to pass away. The lights became more and more blurred, and the surroundings were as silent as death. My heart was beating, my leather shoes were stomping. I couldn't tell if my mood was sad or happy? Was that moment of joy exchanged for more desolate memories?</p>
<p>Finally, I arrived home. The mist was isolated outside the lights. Reality was a cup of bitter sobering tea. I raised my neck and drank it all up!</p>

<h3>Lament for the Peach Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Rose</p>
<p>In the morning,</p>
<p>wandering back from the realm of dreams, I jumped into my own body, and then I woke up, yawned, and stretched. Looking at the watch, the long hand was pointing at the six, and the short hand was pointing between the seven and the eight, which meant that I should get up; so I got out of bed, hurriedly put on my clothes, washed up, and had breakfast. Everything was ready, so I stepped onto the road, and the tram took me to the office.</p>
<p>On the tram, the soul was still dozing in my body; getting off the car and walking into the office, the air inside seemed a little different from the outside, so harsh that it made people shiver. So the soul did a somersault in my body, sat up straight, and did the work of the day. Until the sky was already dark, the tired body carried its own soul out of the office and returned home. Because of the day's labor, everything had lost interest, so the soul was dozing in the body again, until the body fell on the bed, and without Miss Butterfly singing a lullaby, the soul had already slipped into the realm of dreams.</p>
<p>Every day like this, every month like this, every year like this, I live like this.</p>
<p>But this name, life, seems to be not very accurate anymore. In my body, it has lost its vitality, and in my soul, it has lost its energy. I don't even know that I have my own existence. I only know that I have to maintain my own existence for my family, do some work for others, exchange some money from other people's pockets to maintain the existence of my family, every day like this, like a machine, I no longer know that I have my own existence.</p>
<p>Not only do I not know that I have my own existence, but I also don't know that there is an environment. Walking on the roads of the civilized and crystallized city, dazzling and heart-stirring goods are waving in the windows, but the empty purse makes me dare not have any desires, and even the courage to glance at them has completely disappeared. Sometimes, the weather is warm, but I only have a thick cotton coat, so I have to carry it on my body as usual; sometimes, the weather is cold, but I only have a thin shirt, so I have to barely wrap it around my shivering body. The environment makes me dare not know that there is an environment.</p>
<p>I have also thought about leaving this city with high living expenses and returning to the countryside with lower living expenses, but in the city, I still have a job that can barely maintain my family's livelihood. If I return to the countryside, I may not be able to find a job that is enough to maintain my family's food and clothing. Although the living expenses there are low, it is of no use after all, so I still have to hold on to this job tremblingly, for fear of losing it.</p>
<p>Day after day, year after year, I have been living like this.</p>
<p>On Qingming Day, Yun brought back a few peach blossoms from Longhua, a few sparse branches, inserted them into a vase, and decorated this messy small room.</p>
<p>Plants that get water and sunlight will eventually develop habitually. These peach blossoms, kept in a vase, actually blossomed fully, and after the petals fell, green sprouts of leaves grew on the branches. But at first glance, this small creature, in this messy small room, seems to be particularly haggard and lifeless. Because unnatural growth eventually creates an unnatural atmosphere!</p>
<p>However, such unnatural growth can never be maintained for long. Yun forgot to change the water for it for two days, and the green buds on the branches all withered. Alas, poor peach blossoms, struggling in this unnatural growth, eventually died young! This cannot help but make me think of myself with emotion. Am I not like these few peach blossoms? My life depends entirely on my environment, seeking an unnatural life, just like these few peach blossoms, broken off and inserted into a vase, unable to grow naturally, relying entirely on people's care, but once the care is lost, then there is only the path to premature death.</p>
<p>But in this city, there are countless people living like me, but how many of them have thought about their own destiny, just like these few peach blossoms that have been broken off and inserted into a vase.</p>
<h3>Spring Dusk</h3>
<p>— Zi Teng</p>
<p>One quiet spring evening, I was wandering aimlessly in the fields about five miles from X village. The setting sun shone its gorgeous evening glow from afar, reflected in the clear stream in front of me, illuminating the stream as brightly as brocade. The evening breeze stirred the heartstrings, and the willows swaying along the bank occasionally emitted a faint, beautiful sound. And occasionally, a few dog barks were heard from the village, as if welcoming this beautiful spring dusk.</p>
<p>While I was enjoying this poetic and picturesque spring dusk alone, suddenly my eardrums heard a very faint and sad cry, which touched the strings of my lonely heart. Driven by curiosity, my footsteps involuntarily followed the direction of the cry. Crossing the clear stream in front of me, a corner of a red building covered by tree branches suddenly came into my view. At the same time, the sobbing sound was much louder than what I had heard before. So I slowed down my pace and walked forward. On the railing of the red building close to the stream, I found a young woman, around the age of twenty-eight, standing gracefully against the wind. Her round face was like yellow paper, her messy long hair draped over her shoulders, her face was full of crystal tears, and her appearance was extremely haggard and pitiful.</p>
<p>"I have no hope in this life, alas! … I never thought you would be so cruel! Didn't you say that I was your dearest one in the past? Didn't you recognize me as your lifelong companion? Alas! A man's heart is like a needle in the bottom of the sea, alas! …" she said in a tone like a cold cricket, her voice gradually trembling. I didn't hear clearly what she said later.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of tearing paper rang from above, followed by pieces of paper falling around me like autumn leaves. Picking them up, I saw that they were pieces of broken love letters. The handwriting was no longer clear—because darkness enveloped all around. I didn't dare to linger any longer. I hurriedly left the red building, my mind imprinted with the outline of a lovelorn young woman. (End)</p>
<h3>Who Escapes From Myself</h3>
<p>— An Ancient Person</p>
<p>As soon as people reach adulthood, they are constantly struggling in three environments: "pursuit," "coping," and "transformation."</p>
<p>"Pursuit" is to meet the immediate needs of life, "coping" is to solve all the things that arise at any time, and "transformation" is to wash away the unfavorable and move towards the new and good, the goal is to "happiness."</p>
<p>It is easy for individuals to seek their own happiness, just defeat all obstacles, flatter the strong, and welcome and unite with those who are equal in strength to me, and individual "happiness" will undoubtedly succeed.</p>
<p>However, there are two reasons why people do not act in this way: one is wise, which is out of "moral" concepts and "humanitarianism" and cannot bear to do so. The other is ignorant and of course, will not know this art of seeking personal happiness.</p>
<p>But those who can make good use of it are also these two kinds of people!</p>
<p>As for those who seem to know but don't know, who are neither up nor down, they are the inferior roots that create a society of all evils. (Here I declare that I also belong to this category)</p>
<p>Indeed, the so-called gentleman is absolutely unable to stand in this society. However, even if you are a true gentleman, no one will believe you, because</p>
<p>that's how society is.</p>
<p>"Pursuit" is human nature. Without pursuit, there will be no war. Once there is war, it will naturally tend to coping. If coping is successful, happiness will naturally arise - so there is a saying: "Art is produced when you are full and have nothing to do." This is the principle.</p>
<p>Readers, don't suspect that I am a philosophy believer, because "modern literature" has flowed into the middle ground between "philosophy" and "science." Secondly, many gentlemen often talk about "philosophy," and I dare to assert that if you ask them what philosophy is, I believe they will not be able to answer.</p>
<p>Talking about half-element and one-element, it is true that the important leaders of philosophy have surrendered to "science." Here I assert again that "the foundation of philosophy" is fundamentally built on the Milky Way.</p>
<p>As for talking about "detachment," they don't understand anything at all! Before the mid-nineteenth century, talking about detachment was understandable, but in the twentieth century, seeking detachment is "blindly following," or it is ignorance, or perhaps a fancy "restoration."</p>
<p>Poor us, everything... seems to be still fighting in "philosophy."</p>
<p>That's right, this world can only accommodate people like us who are neither up nor down!</p>
<p>I say, rather than "philosophy," it is better to say "art," which is more pleasant to hear and see, and more open and aboveboard. Where exactly to detach to? Probably only wise people understand detachment. Jumping into the Huangpu River is detachment, and going abroad to travel to famous places is also detachment.</p>
<p>It's hard! We fools, we can't detach, we can't shoulder the burden, we can't bear it, we sit and wait for detachment, this is natural detachment.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, everyone in the world wants to detach, and everyone opposes detachment, so they are forever sinking into contradiction.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement: The content of Mr. Yang Hao's "Modern Companion" is a general introduction to various subjects. The first issue is scheduled to be published on May 1st. I would like to thank you for the sample copy. I heard that after the magazine is published, it will also be sold in this city.</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>Between Flesh and Blood (9)</h3>
<p>— Man Zhi</p>
<p>Gui Sun said, "Lian Sun, brother, aren't you considered rich yet? You made thousands of dollars by importing a batch of Japanese cloth. What's the matter with treating guests for two dollars every day?"</p>
<p>Lian Sun said, "You only know one thing, but not the other. It is true that you can make money by selling Japanese cloth, but you have to deal with those people. They take 500 out of every 1,000 you earn. In fact, you don't earn much. What do you call rich?"</p>
<p>Gui Sun didn't believe it, and the two started arguing again. Jian Guang felt bored and was yawning, feeling depressed looking at the rain falling in the courtyard. After a while, Pu Ning brought the wine and dishes in. The three sat around the table and started drinking. While drinking, they talked. Lian Sun tentatively asked Jian Guang,</p>
<p>"Where are you going this time?"</p>
<p>"To Hong Kong. Going to Shanghai is not certain. But, I think, I don't have travel expenses, so I'm afraid I can't go!" Jian Guang said, taking out two pistols from his waist. Lian Sun and Gui Sun were startled. They saw him say again, "These two dogs are excellent revolvers, each equipped with a hundred bullets. I wonder if they can be sold for one hundred and sixty dollars?"</p>
<p>Lian Sun thought he was going to extort money, and his heart was pounding. Hearing this, he realized that he wanted to sell them, and he was relieved. He hurriedly replied, "Yes, yes." Jian Guang said again,</p>
<p>"If you want them, Brother Lian Sun, I'll sell them to you. If I get this money, I can travel." Lian Sun was thinking about his sixth uncle's plan. If he got these two revolvers, would he still pay the money tomorrow? Just as he was about to agree, he saw Gui Sun搶着(抢着) say, "Sell them to me. I have use for them in my hometown." Lian Sun said a little angrily, "Don't I have use for them? First come, first served." Jian Guang was afraid that they would argue, so he mediated and said, "Don't argue, one for each person. Eighty dollars each, and the money must be paid tomorrow. Only then did the two of them agree, seeing that they couldn't monopolize them. Lian Sun poured more wine, and Jian Guang, confident in his great drinking capacity, drank glass after glass, returning the toast to the two of them, and they also drank them dry. Then they started playing finger-guessing games.</p>
<p>Lian Sun saw that Jian Guang was already a little drunk, so he resorted to a vicious trick, putting anesthetic into the wine pot. Jian Guang drank glass after glass, and soon could not hold on any longer and fell off the chair! Gui Sun pretended to push him up to drink. Seeing that he was unconscious, Lian Sun hurriedly told Pu Ning to invite Sixth Master over. As soon as Pu Ning left, the two争着(争着)抢 his pistol and bullets.</p>
<p>The sky was dark, the rain was falling, and the wind was howling. The lamplight in the room flickered dimly. Sixth Master led his wife to the new house. He saw Jian Guang drunk and collapsed on the chair at a glance and shouted, "Come!" He tied a knot in the cloth strip in his hand and put it around his neck. He took one end himself, and gave the other end to his wife. Although his wife took it, she was reminded of the dream of the previous night, and her heart was pounding, her hands and feet were trembling, she had no strength at all, and she fainted. Sixth Master was angry with his wife.</p>
