<h3>爲新生活運動進一言侃</h3>
<p>近來當局以新生活運動相號召。故上自政府機關。下至街頭巷尾。凡農工商學兵各界。莫不風行草偃。如響斯應。此種表示。不可不謂爲全民醒覺之徵蓋年來民氣頽靡。民德偷薄。貪鄙放蕩之風。且較晋末明季爲尤甚。苟能及時振奮。人各自勵。充實自我之力量。調整舉國之行動。則自强有望。外族之蹂躏。或可倖避。否則淪胥之禍。迫於眉睫。刀爼之下。將求爲奴隸而不能。欲再以新生活運動。喚醒國魂。籠鳥圖飛。其可得乎。</p>
<p>新生活運動之主旨。卽在以禮義廉恥。維繫人心。舉人生衣食住行四事。納之於四維規範之中。則舉凡資生之具。行動之方。自有凖繩可尋。取之必以義。用之必以禮。奉公必以廉。守已必以恥。一切非禮背義寡廉鮮恥之事。皆有所不爲。能如是。則居官者無貪汚之風。貿遷者無詐欺之習。工不偷减圖。利學不侈張靡亂埋頭苦幹。舉國一心。則國事之敗壞社會之堕落决不至如今日之</p>
<p>極也。</p>
<p>今者國人似已知所覺悟矣。雖然。四維之要。首在明恥。無恥卽無禮義廉可言。世多有侈談新生活。而背棄其眞諦者。亦有承言希旨。人云亦云者。更有投合時尙借新生活之名。而自躋於摩登人物之林者。言行不相顧。表裏不一致。身不修而家不齊。徒以大言相欺誑。上行下效。是率國人而出於僞也。欲以四維繫人心。而人心愈見其渙。欲新國人之生活。而生活愈趨於難。此皆存心欺妄。不明恥之一字致之也。夫恥之不明。何以爲政。更何以敎戰。如是而言新生活運動。不猶如「團結一致一精神團結」等口號。徒供官僚政客添一術語乎。</p>
<p>昔人有言。「人道敏政。」向來我國民風。凡上有好者。下必甚焉。「楚王好細腰。宮中多餓死。城中好高　四方高一尺「故當此舉國以新生活相互號召之時。領袖人物之一舉一動。一言一行。皆足以轉移國人之視聽。人格感化。其。效最宏。世人稱甘地居不蔽風雨。列寗主政。衣履猶敝。墨索里尼，希特勒之輩。皆以刻苦自勵。爲其徒率。反觀我國歷史。其能砥礪廉隅以身作則者。自曾左以來。近百年間。能有幾人。此則各界領袖。今日所首應自勵者也。</p>
<p>故吾以爲新生活運動之要件。不在於宣傳之如何熱鬧。。而在於領袖之能否奉行。不在於規條之如何完備。而在於踐履之是否有誠心。不在求備於人。而在乎嚴以律已。行遠自邇。登高自卑。固必然之理也。</p>

<h3>楊永泰出席保安會議演說詞</h3>
<p>南昌通信、本月二日、楊永泰講述「第二次保安會議之工作總評及今後保安事業之改進」、全文如下、</p>
<p>「昨天一天、各位工作報告進行很順利、兩天的工作、一天就完畢了、現在依照會議的程序、對於各位的報告、簡單的作一個總結論、再請委員長來訓話、訓話之後卽散會、預定今天下午要開的會、就不必舉行了、</p>
<p>去年舉行第一次保安會議、各省的保安處長、多有來到過會的、現在過了一年多、又在此地舉行第二次的會議、範圍比去年大、召集參加的人員、比去年多、昨天聽了各位口頭的報告、已經很詳細、另外還加上書面的報告、更爲明確詳盡、各位去年到今年這一年間、努力的成績、極可欽佩、保安事業的內容、保安事業的進度、都很淸楚的擺在我們的面前了、關於求改革求進步的方面、各位都已有了很有價値的建議、有些是各省共同的要求、也有些是一省或兩省特殊的需要、差不多一天工夫、把八省的保安事業、作了一度的總檢查、可以供委員長很重要的參考、並可以藉此决定今後推進保安事業的方針、這一次各位在南昌集會、大家交換意見、互相觀摩、敢相信明年開第三次保安會議時、必定更有長足的進步、行營與各省和各省相互之間、都能够因爲這次會議而得到很多的益處、現在依照各位報告的性質、分門别類、作成結論、并根據這些結論、來决定今後我們應該努力的途徑、</p>
<p>第一、名稱問題、此次奉召南昌集會者共十省、其中甘肅陜西兩省還沒有確立保安機關的制度、這一次到會的共只八省、但是八省之中、保安機關的名稱、就很不一致、譬如省裏主管保安的機關、有呌做全省保安處的、也有呌做全省保安司令部的、省以下一級、有分區設立保安分處的、也有分區設立保安司令部的、分處長·副分處長·區保安司令·區保安副司令、彼此多不相同至於縣的一級、有設總團部的、有設總隊部的、也有設大隊部的、不但保安機關的名稱、上下各級不一律、就是部隊的名稱、也不一律、有呌做保衛團的、也有呌做保安隊的、保衛團的名稱、是根據內政部所頒布的保衛團法而來的、保安隊的名稱、是根據三省總部所頒布的整理民國條例而來的、這兩種名稱、同時存在、實在很不相宜、此次開會以後、殊有統一之必要、因爲同一性質的機關和部隊、而有種種不同的名稱、容易使人家看了眼花、今後爲顧名思義、循名核實計、必先正其名、卽使一時間不能完全劃一、至少要求大體上一律、保衛團這個名稱、已無繼續存在的必要、保衛團乃是民團的總稱、照現在的情形看來、他可以包括「壯丁隊」「剷共義勇隊」以至於「保安隊」、無論是有槍枝的、或者是徒手的、都可以名爲「保衛團」、現在各省的保安隊、全是有槍枝的、並且是有嚴整的編制和系統、實與正式軍隊差不多、所以不可再用這種簡統的名稱、兄弟最近到前方視察、江西有槍的團隊、也還是呌做保衛團、可是已往的保衞團、在地方上有種種不良的印象、已失人民之信仰、現在編制雖改、而名稱不改、很不容易轉移觀聽、軍隊和保衛團靠在一起、就不免有點傳統的輕視他的意思、卽保衛團自身、也往往自慚形職、以爲我的能力和勇敢、趕不上軍隊、不也比量齊觀、那是先天的注定了、其實在前方的保衛團、與正式的軍隊、並無多大的分别、大家都有武器、大家都是拿着七八元的月餉、如果呌他做保安隊、就是隊兵、如果呌他做保衛團、就是團丁這種「丁」與「兵」之分、雖然只有一字之差、其關係却是很大、因爲名不能正、就影響於每一個份子的自信力與責任心、這次位建議中、多數主張劃一名稱編制、實所見略同、待委員長核定後當卽先行改正、</p>
<p>第二、編制問題、查各省團隊現行編制、大槪分爲兩種、（一）由省保安機關直轄的、大槪都呌做保安團、（二）非由省保安機關直轄而由縣管轄的、其中有呌做縣保安隊、或呌做縣保衛團、彼此殊不一律、而省轄縣轄、兩制並存、則最爲普通、爲湖南一省、所有保安團隊、皆直轄於全省保安司令部、實已達到團隊統一之極高階段、據昨天李代司令的報告、湖南省對於這一點、曾費了很大的努力、排除了很多的困難、才能達到這個階段、可以說關於保安團隊的整理、在各省中當以湖南爲最進步了、我們預定整理團隊的過程、分爲四個步驟、第一步、已往之保衛團、是屬於區屬於鄉屬於鎭的、甚至還有屬於一村一姓的、完全是一種零碎分割的狀態、都把持在土豪劣紳的掌握中、地方官吏、無法過問、自從前年整理民團條例頒布以後、這種四分五裂、彼疆此界的紛亂情形、才漸漸打破漸漸改善、切編制·訓練·調遣·人事·經理·纔漸漸的能統一於縣、今年與去年比較、這個第一步的工作、可是說是普遍的做到了、第二步、就是要統一於行政督察區、全區各縣的團隊、要由區保安司令或保安分處長統一起來、一切經理·人事·敎育·編制·調遣·都要完全集中於督察區、照現在各省情形而論、有些被匪縣份、極需要團隊防剿、可是地方凋敝、無力負担團隊經費、有些縣份、向未被匪或被匪較輕、雖有給養團隊之力量、而無編練團隊之需要、各分畛域、全失掉酌盈劑虚的作用、不能以此之有餘補彼之不足、形格勢禁、匪患就永不能敉平、故各縣團隊統一於區、基於事實之要求、尤有絶對的必要、待辦到統一於區之後、第三步、就是再進而統、於省、一切皆由省集中管理、而由區分防使用、各省情形不一律、步驟或有慢有快、可是到了明年此時、卽使不能一律達到第三步省的統一、而最低限度、第二步區的統一、必須一律完成、這是要我們一致努力的、除了以一三個步驟之外、百尺竿頭、更要再進到第四步的工作、保安事業、才算達到理想的要求、這就是說一切保安團隊、要由國家管理、由地方使用、每省畫定若干個團管區、抽調區內壯丁、最少每年每區要訓練一個保安團、練成之後、卽交給該管區給養替代他原有的保安團、卽派在該管區服務、等到第二年第二期之保安團練成後、則第一期發交本區服務之保安團、乃退作預備役、如此更番訓練、更番退役、輪流下去、就可以確立徵兵制的基礎、現在各省差不多都是由第一步到第二步的進程中、希望明年都能做到第三步、湖南的團隊、已經統一於省、可以說第三步的工作全做到了、凡是做到第三步的省份、必須切實再向第四步進行、如果不向第四步猛進、而以團隊統一於省爲滿足、就根本失掉了訓練保安團隊的意義、其結果就變成省防軍、現在中國軍隊、已多得很、何必再練省防軍呢、如查因爲本省兵力、不足維持地方洽安、索性擴編一師兩師或十團八團罷了、又何必另立保安團隊的名目呢、我們編練保安團隊、就要認明保安團隊的意義、重在更番訓練、更番退役、與現行募兵制之陸軍根本不同、要由小規模的「抽丁制」過渡到大規模的『徵兵制』、以爲改造陸軍之基礎、旣帶了這種使命、可見各位保安長官所負的責任、就非常重大了、所以無論那一省、已完成第一步、就要向第二步猛進、已完成第二步、就要向第三步猛進、已完成第三步、更要向第四步猛進、努力不懈、非完全達到第四步不止、保安事業的根本意義、才能充分發揮出來、上面所說的幾個步驟、委員長籌慮已熟、最近行營方面、必能詳細規定、早日頒布實行、切盼各省當局、同步共趨、計日程功、</p>
<p>第三、訓練問題、從各位昨天的報告中、關於團隊幹部訓練的情形、豫鄂皖三省有幹部訓練班、湖南是併於西路軍的敎導總隊中、或抽送中央軍校特别班訓練·江蘇·浙江·福建·江西·四省有設幹部訓練所的、也有設敎導大隊的、又西路軍的敎導總隊內、設有軍士隊訓練班長、湖北各行政督察區及浙江的各保安分處、都設有班長訓練所或訓練班、由此看來、各省團隊幹部的訓練機關、都已設立、有些是兩三省合辦的、有些是各省各辦的、可是訓練保安團隊之最終目的、是在實現第四步的工作、由國家管理由地方使用、以爲實行徵兵制之基礎、所以不僅校官尉官的養成和訓練要絶對的統一、就是士兵的訓練、也應有統一的辦法纔好、這個問題太大、內容也太複雜、應待委員長詳細考慮後、再行規定、總之、團隊官兵的敎育、凡是科目的內容、程度的深淺、精神的提示、均不可稍有參差、如果各自爲政、各成風氣、那就不能够達到第四步的階段、和我們創設保安團隊的目的、就有點不符了、在各位建議中、關於編制的有二十七件、關於訓練的有八件、大體都可採用、各位回去以後、如果還有更好的意見、在兩星期內、可用書面寄來、當於制定整個方案時、儘量採用、現在以保安團隊爲基幹、更番訓練壯丁、有兩省的辦法很好、浙江的訓練隊、每年訓練壯丁六萬、分作兩期、每期三個月、在農事空閒的時候舉行、湖北張主席、最近有個計劃、預備把保安團三分之、退伍、實行更番訓練、每年也可以訓練壯丁二萬六千多人、這兩省的計劃、都是很切實的、委員長昨天指示我們、訓練團隊、并不足　要他能够喊一·二·三·放槍·　步走就算完事、因爲中國最大的危機、就是大多數人不識字、無常識、不能克盡作中國國民的責任、也不知道做人的道理、如果我們要學外國、慢慢地來做普及敎育的工作、實在來不及了、因爲義務敎育、小學敎育、只能培養造就、十年以後的國民、二十年內國家的主人翁、卽是今日的壯丁、今日大多數的壯丁、日常生活規則、和國民常識、尙且一槪不知、如此國民、與二十世紀的國家同時並立、何能與之周旋、豈不眞是笑話、現在一時要把全國國民都軍事紀律化起來、當然是很難、但是先從壯丁入手、把各省的壯丁、更番編入保安團隊、先從訓練保安團隊入手、那是最切實是有效的步驟、不到數年間、各省的壯丁、都受了必要的軍事敎育、同時也受了相當的國民敎育、不但徵兵制可望實行、也就是國民的補習敎育最速成最簡便的方法了、我們的口號、是「寓將於校」、「寓兵於團」、「寓敎於軍」、換言之我們團隊的練兵、就是辦學、這一點要大家切實認淸纔好、委員長昨日指示我們訓練團隊的方法、（一）要敎他做人的道理、卽是要實行新生活綱要和新生活須知、（二）要敎他做中國人的道理、卽是要人人都有國家觀念和民族精神、不要做漢奸、要做義士烈士、（三）要敎他有警察憲兵的常識、關於第三點、意義很重大、兄弟要特别引申一下、請各位特别注意、現代的國家、軍隊是用於國防的、維持地方治安的責任、是完全由憲兵警察來擔任的、如果要靠軍隊來維持地方治安、就是呌他來代替警察憲兵的工作、如此情形、軍隊的軍風紀、一定是很難維持的、但是在中國的現狀之下、人力財力都很缺乏、如果各地方都要辦好大規模的警察憲兵、來維持地方的安寗秩序、這是做不到的、往後我們要靠保甲來做農村警察、要靠保安隊來做農村憲兵、保甲與保安隊、都是土著、地方情形熟　、利害關係密切、只要加以相當的訓練、比較招募而來的警察與憲兵、一定更有效力、更能盡責、換一方面說、各省現在以軍隊及保安隊剿匪、以保甲淸匪、不久剿匪工作、旣可完成、難道土匪消滅以後、保安隊卽可解散、保甲卽可取消嗎、所以以後訓練團隊、應特别注意憲兵警察的常識、其意義卽在剿匪以後、務必使團隊能够切實擔負憲兵與警察的任務、這纔是保安隊的本職、在平時爲地方憲警、在戰時爲國家徵兵、根本意義在此、這一點也要各位切實認淸的、</p>
<p>第四、經費問題、各省團隊的經費、根據各位的報告、安徽每約需月三十餘萬元、福建每月約需三十六萬餘元、湖北每月約需四十萬元、江西每月約需四十五萬元、湖南每月約需四十六萬餘元、江蘇每月約需四十八萬元、浙江每月約需五十一萬元、總合各省所報的數目、各省每月團隊經費、最多的已到五十萬以上、最少的亦在三十萬以上、可見各省對於保安團隊、都支付了一筆很大的經費、如果沒有相當的成效、發生相當的作用、那眞是對不起民衆、但是經費是一切事業的基礎、要求事情辦得通、工作做的好、整理經費、自然是第一要着、就兄弟個人所知道的、湖北的范處長、前年對我說、湖北全省各縣、自由抽捐、自由辦團、每年消耗於團隊的經費、大略估計、總有一千五百餘萬元之多、實較省庫額定的收入、大逾一倍、如果精密調查、連同經征人員的中飽併計、也許還不止此數、湖北如此、他省的情形、恐怕也與范處長所說的差不多、已往各省保衛團的黑暗、實在閙得太不成事體了、自前年三省總部頒布了整理縣地方財政章程之後、每縣必須設一個財務委員會、一切財政、由縣統收統支、上面所說的手病、才慢慢糾正過來、財源才漸漸確定、雖不敢說已一律辦好、然收支的方法、都正在逐步改善、據最近湖北省的報告、全年可靠的團隊經費收入、經全省團費整理委員會的整理、極力删减、共計可得四百六十餘萬元、比較從前、民衆方面、可以减輕三分之二以上的担負了、故關於保安經費的整理、也要經過三個步驟、第一步統一于縣、第二步統一於行政督察區、第三步統一於省、單是把經費統一于縣、還是沒有辦法的、因爲全省的各縣、比較起來、土地的肥瘠不同、物產的豐嗇不同、人民的貧富不同、稅收的多寡不同、匪情的輕重也不同、如果以縣爲單位、大抵最貧苦的縣份、都是邊僻之地、匪情必最重、需要團隊最爲殷切、而籌措經費特别困難、目前至少要由行政督察區來統籌兼顧、團隊的配備和運用、才能够洽當、官兵的勞逸、才能够平均、關於此點、各位的建議共有十二件、都可供參考、行營最近一定要制定切合實際的方案、通令各省遵辦、各省縱然因爲有特殊的情形、不能馬上絶對一致、這個大體的方針、最先統一於縣、進而統一於區、再進而統一於省、那是絶對不能錯的、</p>
<p>第五、剿匪工作的情形、聽了各位的報告、江蘇現在僅有江北的漣水·沭陽·兩縣稍有匪患、浙江內地安靖、不過是沿海和江西福建兩省的邊境、尙時有海盜和共匪的侵擾、河南過去本是匪股最多的省份、現在大股的匪、已漸漸肅淸了、安徽也迭次撲滅了大股帮匪、現在只有靠近三省邊區的立煌·霍山·至德·等縣、尙有匪擾、湖南的團隊、他的力量不僅能够維護省內治安、而且有一部份能够隨同西路軍開到省外來剿匪、現在僅有湘粤邊境一點股匪竄擾、也正在切實</p>
<p>追剿、湖北內地很安静、祇是鄂東、鄂南、鄂北·各邊區縣份、仍當有零匪竄擾、江西的團隊、最近一年以內、參加剿匪、共計二百餘處、尤其是金谿左坊之役、最有成績、這一年來各省團隊剿匪的力量、比較從前確實是强得多了、但是獨立作戰的能力、或者還差一點、這也是公認的事實、就此次到會的八省而論、各省團隊的官兵和槍枝、每省都在二三萬以上、各省的壯丁隊、每省也都報了二百萬左右、如果照上面所講的辦法、把這二三萬的團隊做基礎、使他們所受的訓練推廣、普及於二百萬的壯丁、連合運用、打成一片、這種成績、必定很有可觀、縮小範圍來講使這八省之內一千六七百萬的壯丁都能够明白做人的道理、都受過國民的補習敎育、都能有警察　兵之常識、就可以做社會的中堅、做一切地方建設的樞紐、還愁中國不富不强嗎、最短期間、中國全國國民、縱然不能全體軍事紀律化、可是這一千六七百萬的壯丁、旣受過嚴格的訓練也就可以做良民的模範、良兵的基礎、這希望各位特别努力的、</p>
<p>以上是關於各位工作報告的總結論、並且把以後改進保安事業的大方針、說了一個大槪、此外關於各位個别的建議、如福建所提的整理收編民軍案、河南所提的縮編保安隊案、浙江安徽所提的補充彈藥更換槍枝案、安徽所提的請准團隊服裝與國軍一致案、河南所提的出省剿匪的團隊應依照國軍例給予撫恤案、這些都是比較容易解决、的問題、容俟主管機關核議以後、卽可分别批答、希望由第二次會議到第三次會議這一年中間、各位特别努力、完全達到委員長對於各位的希望、」</p>

<h3>平瀋通車聲中麵粉市况轉佳　市價大見起色增至二角餘　新麥登塲均由滬銷至平津</h3>
<p>國內糧食界、自九一八事件發生後、市價一蹶不振、麵粉市價、由三元餘而逐漸下跌至二元弱、本市各麵粉廠、亦相繼停車、暫時勉强維持、惟近數日來、忽一變過去之疲滯狀態、突見旺盛、平均麵粉每包約漲至二三角、由二元弱而增至二元二三角、其原因厥爲平瀋將通車、麵粉大批銷往東北、又因日來天氣旱熱、本年收成、恐不豐富、故市價遂見旺盛、日來麵粉市塲中、成交者甚多、實爲麵粉界之良好現象、華東社記者、昨特向本市麵粉界探詢關於最近麵粉市塲活躍情形、茲分誌如下、</p>
<h3>麵粉轉佳原因有三　麵粉界在不景氣中、　而突然轉佳之原因、</h3>
<p>實有下列三點、（一）麵粉市塲、向爲美麥坎拿大麥所壟斷、惟本年則因美國等處、均患荒旱、故不再侵及中國市塲、而國麵遂見起色、（二）國內麵粉、頃雖値新麥登塲麵粉價大多例須慘跌、遂因日來天氣奇熱、各地均患旱荒、並無甘霖、不能下種預料今年必爲歉收、產量將供不應求、故麵粉市價、遂趨尖俏、逐見高漲、（三）平瀋通車、七月一日卽將實行、吾國麵粉向多推銷東三省、九一八後、此偌大市塲斷絶、於是麵粉遂生產過剩、通車之後、又將恢復過去銷路、乃突見旺盛、</p>
<h3>內地麵粉均將運滬</h3>
<p>據本市麵粉市塲之消息、近數日來麵粉市</p>
<p>價、每包自一元九角餘增至二元二三角、較前大有上下、麵粉業均爲之欣慰、爲本年來未有之良好現象、購者甚多、且因最近新麥雖已登塲、而運至滬上者、均爲黃豆、麵粉甚少、故反有供不應求之槪、現在內地麵粉、均將運至上海、以待價而沽云、</p>
<h3>華北銷路大見活躍</h3>
<p>在華北之麵粉、前多爲日方供給、頃經國產麵粉商與之努力競爭、又因市價旺漲、運費開支、均頗合算、故而自滬上之至平津之麫粉、爲數不在少數、華北銷路、頓見活躍矣、</p>

<h3>市長訓詞</h3>
<p>主席報告畢、吳市長致訓詞謂、今天舉行上海市歷屆殉職警察紀念碑揭幕典</p>
<p>禮、我們在如此悲壯熱烈的空氣中、應該深切的勵行和認識以下三點重要的意義第一、大家應該努力盡忠現在各人的職務、第二、大家應該切實效法過去殉職的警察、第三、大家應該發揚民族固有「仁義」的精神、以前兄弟對本市軍警同志演講、在每次演講中、都有一個一貫的中心思想、這個思想的要點、就是相勉各位要盡忠職務、盡忠職務、從一般人的立場來講、非但是一種最正確的人生態度、並且還是一生事業成功的唯一原則、從我們公務員的立場來講、則尤其應該懸爲服務道德的最高原則、因爲行政效率的能否增加、民衆福利的能否增進、都是繫乎做公務員的能否盡忠於他的職務、這一層意義、兄弟已經翻覆的和本市軍警講過、今天不再重複、今天我們所以要立碑紀念本市歷屆殉職警察、其最顯明而重要的意義、一方面就是在紀念他們盡忠職務的精神、一方面尤其在勉勵後死在職的警察、要在這一個紀念碑的深刻的感召力之下、能够永遠不忘歷屆殉職警察忠誠熱烈爲公犧牲的精神、非但不忘、並且還要能够承繼、和發揚他們這種偉大的精神、從今以後、希望本市警察、都要能够忠於自已的職務、不要臨難苟免、不要見危遠避、應該把職務放在自已生命的前面、把職務看得比自已的生命更重要、現在一般國民、大都爲一種卑怯自私、俞安享樂、頽廢萎靡的個人主義所支配着、因此大家祇看到一已的利益、一已的安樂、而忘記了整個社會的利益、甚且爲了個人的私利、從而妨害了整個民族的生存、我們古來的大聖大賢、他們所敎導民衆的思想、都是主張犧牲「小我」而以「仁義的精神、來維持「大我」的生存的、如孔子說、「殺身成仁」、孟子說、「生我所欲也、義我所欲也、二者不可得兼、舍生而取義也」、不圖我們民族固有的「仁義」的精神、到現在竟丢棄得乾乾凈凈、所以到處祗見小我的發展、私利的膨脹、而我們民族的「生存力」、都日形衰微、我們如果要追究造成今日國難的遠因、實不能不歸結於這種民族精神的墮落、所以我們今日立碑紀念殉職警察、另一方面深刻偉大的意義、尤在發揚我們民族固有的犧牲小我、維持大我的仁義的精神、則此區區一碑、在形式上雖不十分巍峨、然在其精神的感召力上、未始不可算是改造國民心理、奮勵民族精神的基礎、今天我特趁舉行揭幕典禮的機會、把我們所以立碑的意義、簡單而誠懇的爲諸君說明、希望諸君不但要能够認識、能够紀念、還要能够切實猛省和力行、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>動物有沒有本能？（二）</h3>
<p>二十三日我們對於汪德明君提出的問題，先就動物有沒有本能簡略的討論過了。本來應該在二十四日接續登載本篇，因二十三夜發稿，被送信人一時忘記，致二十四日沒有讀書問答，今日繼續討論本能在人類身上如何的被智慧所包攝，所揚棄。</p>
<p>前節論到一般動物有沒有本能的問題。我們反對行爲主義者的形而上學的研究方法，他們把低級現象（剌激和反應的過程）片面地誇大了，而忘却了高級現象（本能）的特殊意義。但返過來說，若抬高了本能的特殊意義，使它完全與剌激和返應的現象分離，而當做一種完全孤立的東西，那也同樣是片面的觀點。生物學上所謂「生機說」或「活力說」，就是把動物的行爲看做一種特别的活力作用，不把它與低級的物質作用連繫起來研究，結果動物的行爲好像是有一種神秘的精靈在後面推動似的、這很容易將人的思想引導到觀念論、甚至於引導到宗敎迷信的方面去，也是要反對的，因此行爲主義者的唯物的實騐的方法，就値得我們推重。換一句話說，我們可以用批判的態度去接受行爲主義者的研究，贊成本能只是一串剌激和反應的綜合，而同時，旣成爲本能，便也有本能所特有的性質，與單純的剌激和反應不同。我們的結論是：動物是有本能的。</p>
<p>人類是動物，當然也有本能。但人類與普通的動物不同，因此人類的本能也另有　種意義，現在就要討論這一點。</p>
<p>人類與動物的不同，是因爲能製造工具，這是汪君也提到過的。但人類能製造工具，能以工具取得所需要的物質，不必全賴爪牙和氣力，這就使人類的生活比較動物的生活更發展了一步，人類的生活是比動物的本能生活更高級的，更明白的說，人類的生活是智慧的生活。自然，如果以爲人類的生活和動物完全不同，那也未免陷入片面的見解，最大的兩種基本本能，如汪君所說的食慾和性慾，是不論人類和動物都一樣的。但動物要達到這本能的目的，其方法不外是應用自已身上生來具有的器官，一切行爲都受着生理上的限制，所以動物的生活是純粹的本能生活，人類能利用工具，用外物來代替自已的器官，這使人類超出了本能生活。</p>
<p>人們常把蟻的羣集組織與人類的社會組織相類比，這是錯誤。蟻的羣體完全是基因於蟻的生理構造而形成的。但社會的組織是人類因應用工具實行生產而發生的互相結合，也就是所謂生產關係，蟻的羣體受生理的限制，故這種羣體的組織凝固不動，沒有改善和變革的餘地。人類則能不斷地改善他的生產工具及其應用方式，使生產能力發展，而人類間的相互關係也因之改變。革命就是因生產力的發展而引起來的生產關係之變革。動物的羣組織是有機體的組織，而人類的羣組織是社會的組織；有機組織的變革和進化只能依賴自然淘汰，而社會的變革的原因則是社會生產力的增高和發展　人類生活與動物生活是這樣不同的。</p>
<p>因此，如果不分淸楚人類生活與動物生活，以爲人類的行爲也是以本能爲標凖，這仍是誇大了低級現象而忘却高級現象的形而上學的看法。這種錯誤的看法是常常有的，例如有的歷史家常以爲一國的君主屠殺别國的城池，是爲了爭奪美女的緣故，這是以性慾本能解釋歷史之一例，又如英國的馬爾薩斯的人口論，以人口過剩及食物不足來解釋民族與國家間的戰爭，這又是以食慾本能解釋歷史之一例。具實這些說法都是蒙弊了眞理的。</p>
<p>評判一個人的行爲，也不是以行爲之能否適合本能爲標凖的。戀愛或甚至於犯姦的行爲，雖然是本能的發揮，不一定是罪惡，但也不一定就常値得同情，如果一個人因迷於戀愛而疏忽了他在社會上所應負的負任，那還是會成爲罪惡的。善惡的標凖，須得要看那人的行爲在社會關係上會發生什麽意義，然後才能確定　總之，要了解社會和人類的行爲，必須研究人類社會特有的經濟現象（是生產力和生產關係等）研究，不能用低級的動物本能作爲解釋的標凖。自然，人類社會現象是本能現象的延長和發展，我們不能否認，人類與本能是不能分離的。但本能到了人類身上，就被更高的智慧這一種東西所包攝，所揚棄，本能生活到這裏，便隠沒在智慧中；更確切地說，隠沒在社會生活中。因爲人類智慧的活動範圍是不能超出生活之外的。</p>
<p>所以，人類不是沒有本能，但在人類生活中，本能只有次要的意義，不能决定人類行爲</p>
<p>的根本方向。智慧是人類行爲中的固有性，而本能是「附屬性」。反之，在動物生活中，也並不是沒有智慧的萌芽，猿類能用樹枝或石子擊物已是最初步的工具之應用，但這在猿類的生活中並不是主要的行爲，只是偶然的行爲，因此，除人類以外，動特的生活都可以說是本能的生活。（完）</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>當丙廚夫生火的時候，甲乙兩廟夫無論怎樣閑空，也不願稍助一臂之力的，寗可瞪出了眸子在旁邊瞧着，不屑動一動；因爲他們覺得這種低微的工作，是要有損他們的尊嚴的。我看只要在宮裏當一些差使的人，上至太監總管，下至打掃夫，可說是沒有一個人不愛體面的，也沒有一個人不會搭架子，這大槪也是受了皇太后的薰陶吧？</p>
<p>待到那爐火生旺之後，少不得也有一陣濃烈的煤氣；當然，這是十分不合衛生的。在車子上奉天去的路上，有好幾名太監因爲受不住這種吳味而病倒了。不過他們漸漸地也乖覺起來，每次生火，總把所有的車窗全打開，這樣就不再聽見有中煤毒的人了。除掉開窗之外，另外還有一個减少煤氣的方法，就是在那爐灶上開一個小洞，當開始生火的時候，先用一節很短的烟囱裝在這個小洞上，而把這烟囱的出口，向着窗外，於是那般濃烈的煤氣，便有一大半可以吹散出去了。待到爐內的煤球已經生得十分的旺了，就是全部已變了透明的紅色，（這種煤炭是極其耐燃的，一經生旺，便可以用好久的工夫。）這才把那短烟囱卸下。</p>
<p>爲着要减少生火的時間起見，那些丙廚夫總得用一柄葵扇凑在那爐灶前端的火門上盡力的望裏面搧着；可是因爲這火門的位置太低，他們非得把身子彎下去，便無從搧起，所以這一種工作，實在是很辛苦的。</p>
<p>我們再來算一算看；每一座爐灶上有甲，乙，丙三個廚夫，此外尙有無數的太監，往來搬運，這一起人的數目，可是眞不少了·所以在那四輛權充御膳房的火車上，一到了進餐的時間，空氣便立卽緊張起來了。（六八）</p>
<h3>水鳥閒譚</h3>
<p>— 閒織</p>
<p>凡洲居者，四面環江，頗饒雅趣，蘆葦深處，常爲水鳥出入游息之所，如漫畫與信天翁，則爲常見之鳥，每於晨夕止於水邊，識之者，且能知其性，較山居老叟靠山知鳥音者，高出一籌矣。</p>
<p>漫畫爲涉禽類之鳥，嘴扁平，其狀如篦，故又名篦鷺，全體灰色，頂無羽冠，奔走腐草泥沙間，唼唼然搜索食物，未索盡不已，無一息少休，性使然也。</p>
<p>信天翁，又名信天緣，見辭源）禮大，翼張可達丈餘，嘴端鈎曲，翼色黑，背色灰，飛翔力甚强，毛柔軟可以作褥，偶凝於水際，獨立不動。顧魚過其下，則取之，終日無魚，亦不易地，不食亦無飢色，而反加壯，其禀性不同如此　漫畫則貪得無厭，信天翁則廉介自守，以之諷世間一般貪汚之輩，將作何感想乎？明藍廷瑞詩云：「荷錢荇帶綠江空，唼鯉含鯊淺草中，波上魚鷹貪未飽，何曾餓死信天翁？</p>
<h3>夏夜的街頭</h3>
<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>可怕的夏，已降臨了人間，氣候是隨着日子的轉變，一天熱似一天了。</p>
<p>在夏的季節，太陽是執了最高的權威放出火一般的光芒，使人們在白日伏在家內不敢出門，街上的行人自然覺得稀少了。可是在日落西山的時候，凉風習習的吹來，夜之神也漸漸的撒下黑幕來街頭巷尾，頓見增加出許多人來，男，女，老，幼，從國家大事，談到里巷瑣聞，兒女私情，都是津津有味，但不知可曾想到東北那些陷在水深火熱中的同</p>
<p>胞？</p>
<p>酸梅湯，汽水，冰結漣，都應時候的需要而設了。</p>
<p>街上的行人，也穿梭似的來來往往，年紅燈映射的光芒，帶着富的色彩，無線電播出了，悅耳的歌曲。恰和巷中娘兒們唱着的催眠曲和桃花江，聲聲相應那時舞廳裏，一對對的愛侶，正一個旋律，一個旋律的舞着。雖然有電風扇，不停的旋着，可是仍止不住舞伴的汗流。兩相比較，那裏及得來在夏夜街頭乘凉的朋友呢？這正是一個神秘的夏夜吧？</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三十一回　三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣　全營殉國赤眼入槍林</p>
<p>但是過去兩里路就是山溝。我們在那裏設下埋伏，可以大大的得個便宜。平常行軍决不會那樣冒險的。不過他們欺我們人少，我料想他一定有一部分由那裏衝出試試的。我要派一連人到那裏去埋伏着。自强正了顏色道：營長，這件事得考量吧？我們的力量，也很單簿，不能再分了吧？寳芳正了眼光看他道：大槪你不敢去。趙自强突然向營長作個立正姿勢。也正色道：連長說這話，是由大處着想，對與不對請營長指敎。致於命令連長到那裏去，連長就到那裏去。軍人决不能有不敢這兩個字的念頭。寳芳帶了笑容，點着頭道：你這話也可以說是對的。但是你要曉得我們一營人守這個寨子，我們第一是撈本主義。一個人打死他們兩個，咱們就算贏了。第二我們才談到等援兵。我這話你明白了沒有？寳芳說這話時，同時就向弟兄們很快的看了一眼。自强很明白，營長現在抱的是拼命主義。這個主義是不必要弟兄們知道的。於是用很低的聲音沉着的答應，知道。寳芳又向他身上估量了一番，就不再說什麽，帶領了他在城墻上指指點點，觀察了一遍。經過寳芳這番指點，自强越發是知道營長命意所在了。繞寨行堡一週，跟着寳芳到營本部去商談了一會。當他出營本部的時候，太陽還是正當頂懸着，等到太陽稍微有些偏西的時候，自强已經帶着他全連弟兄，到了那夾溝裏了。這夾溝是三座山嘴子，互相參差着。因之一條人行大道，彎曲着在這兩山夾峙的中間，成了一條溝。由這裏進攻平安堡的北門，地勢較高，守軍不在這裏防守，至少也應當在北門外宣一道防線，讓敵人出了夾口，也沒從容進展的餘地。（四一九）</p>
<h3>螢光美人</h3>
<p>— 金諤儒</p>
<p>螢，飛蟲也，又名益蟲，因食種種害蟲，對於農事有益，故名。夏季就淺水野草間產卵，經十餘日成爲蟲，長三分許，雄者體黃，頭黑有複腮，翅鞘柔軟，點綫密布，雌者無翅，形如蛆，尾端有發光器甚强，呼吸時空氣傳入，生氣化作用，發光頗美麗。時當夏秋之交，户外納凉之際，每見螢光閃閃，北去南來，飛集於淺草叢中，瓜棚底下，羣兒爭撲，儲諸玻璃器中，或手提爲戲，或臥置枕邊，苟蟲數較多，徵集一隅，其光力之强，不減永備電筒也。余幼時，亦好戲此，見螢火，則每有所感，以爲螢光雖好，惜羣兒玩法平凡，不足以爲法。於是處心積慮，日夜思維，務求超諸羣兒之上，乃於某日持蛋殻一枚，趨父輩中之善於畫仕女者，請其蛋殻上畫一美女之頭，携歸家中，秘不告人。及晚，捕得羣螢，卽置之該蛋殻中，封其口，懸諸暗處，遇風擺動，驟然見之，柳眉杏眼，櫻口朱唇，頗具窈窕之姿焉。</p>
<h3>阿鳳傳</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>阿鳳不知其姓氏，因善哭之故，名傳梁溪。伊年約五十左右，縐紋的鵝蛋臉上，時常塗着粉，髮結上，還插着花，眞是「人老心不老」。人家聽到伊的芳名「阿鳳」，還以爲是一位荳蔲年華的風騒姑娘呢。逢到人家大出喪，總有伊的分兒去賣哭，哭着少奶，哭着太太，哭着老爺，哭着：：：伊看死的是什麽人，哭的藝術，也十分巧妙，隨時變化。伊會哭得涕泗滂沱，眼珠兒像胡桃般大，大家又都讚美伊哭得抑揚頓挫的入調。於是伊的賣哭生涯，也就格外興旺了。善哭的名氣，因此大噪。這回一門慘死的秦龔尹霞女士等靈柩回里，也是請伊去哭的，一會兒喊着理齋好少爺，一會兒喊着尹霞好少奶，和小少爺，小姐，哭得異常悲切。阿鳳豈林黛玉之轉世乎？嘻，可以傳矣·</p>
<p>術踪所至</p>
<h3>在湖口</h3>
<p>— 翼之</p>
<p>鄱陽湖與長江會合的出口處的右岸</p>
<p>，有個古樸，寥落的縣域，那便是湖口，提起湖口兩字，我就聯想到反對袁世凱主謀剌宋和擅借巨欵的轟轟烈烈的二次革命來，因爲這就是首先發難的根據地啦！又蘇軾有篇不朽之作：石鐘山記，開口便引水經注說：一彭蠡之口，有石鐘山焉「·彭蠡，卽是鄱陽湖，那麽，湖口又是個名人遊覽過的勝地；所以，當我聽到要被派遣到這兒來的時候，心裏便有說不出的愉快，因爲遊覽名勝，在我是千載一時的機會呵！</p>
<p>石鐘山雖然沒有牯嶺的雄偉，但遠窺長江，滔滔的白浪，片片的風帆，樹葉也似的漁艇，龐大而疾駛的輪船和噴出濃黑色烟霧的輪船上的高烟囱，畫圖般的盡收在我們的眼底；俯臨鄱陽，屹立在湖上的兵艦，鎭静而威武地，浩森的湖水，經不住颶風的襲擊，翻騰着起伏無定的浪濤，笨重的舢板，毫不能自主地也給簸盪得前高後低，左傾右側，艱險呵！這人世的風波！</p>
<p>山上，磷磷的怪石，象徵着各色各樣的生物，有携杖的老人，有蹲在地上的成羣的小孩，也有張牙舞爪似的猛虎；有的石上鐫着擘窠大字，像「雲根」一類的，或者刻着雅人的詩句此外，是很多連繫着的廟宇，走廊，但也有一兩幢單獨的半丁式的樹房·據說，曾文正公爲了要替滿淸消滅洪楊的緣故，曾在鄱陽湖練過水師，那廟宇便因爲紀念他而加以改造的·一座天造地設的，純樸而峭拔的崇山，全給這些破壞自然的人工的建築淹蓋了它的本來的面目，山靈有知，我想，未必干休；不知東波夜泊絶壁下的時候，這山上的寺院又是怎樣的？</p>
<p>聽說蔣委員長很服膺會文正的，前門外，就有他署名的一對長聯，是不是他的親筆，我却無從知道，進去很多的牆壁上，嵌着方塊的大小不一的靑石，上面刻着我已不復記意的一些名人的記序和律詩，卽銜接前門的一道灣曲的長廊旁，也有這一類的東西。記得一個大殿下的天井兩邊的壁上，還做了和現在「新生活運動一所標榜的字眼有些相同的「醬園」式大的忠孝廉節」四個字，這與我故鄉的祠堂裏四個，可說一般無二，據說是朱熹的手筆，但流行得差不多我到過的每個聖廟或祠堂裏都有，誰爲眞蹟，誰爲描製，那可不曉得了·忠，孝，廉，節，盤踞在中國人的腦袋裏，已有好些年代，大槪這廣告式的箴言也不無相當的功效罷　湖口雖然佔着負山面湖的地位，但只有一條狹長的街道，疎疎落落的兩三百家的「三不像的店舖，離亂的年歲，沒有什麽可以消閒的戲看，電影院尤其談不上；然而，爲生存而拍賣肉體的所謂「揚州帮」，却到處可以碰到，伊們唯一的顧客，是當地的統稅局，消費掣騐局，以及兵艦上的官兵，我們是無錢而且覺得無聊的不能行這方便，比較可以慰我客中的寂寞的，只有「取之無禁」的石鍾山上的風景，</p>
<p>在湖口雖然只短短的三個月，可是，腦子裏却留下了永不可磨滅的印象，那便是所謂土匪的進城，皂白是刹那間所不能分的，我的舖蓋，衣服，和其他一切都毁個精光，腦殻兒也是五分鐘的輸嬴，爲誰犧牲呢？我只得啞然！ＸＸ兵艦雖然在晚間也給我以舖位，髣髴性命有了保險，但是，實際上是沒有留連的必要，從此撒手吧！只有性情比較接近的幾位同事和患難相助的湖南旅湖小學的幾個新朋友，至今不曾通過信，難免耿耿於心！</p>
<p>事隔三年，今天整理所有的照片，發現到和廖胡兩君在鐘山所攝的合影不見了，纔想到這流浪生活過程中的一殺人生的險途；寄語湖口朋友，湖光山色，可曾改變沒有？</p>

<p>講到此層、不能不將蘇省中等敎育經費支配情形及本廳最近的計劃略爲報告、蘇省中等敎育經費以經常費而論、在本年度爲二百一十三萬六千四百零三元、內職業學校佔百分之一九、二三、計四十一萬一千八百四十一元、師範學校佔百分之三·九三、計六十六萬零九百九十元、中學佔百分之四九·八四、計一百零六萬三千五百七十二元、與部定標凖相較、職業不足百分之一五·七七、師範學校超過百分之五·九三、中學超過百分之九·八四、雖尙相差不遠、然要想一步就與部頒標凖相合、亦不容易辦到、所以本廳對中學與師範採分期緊縮的辦法、對職業採分期擴充的辦法、而預計在三年內完成、現在二十三年度轉瞬卽屆、本廳對於省立中等學校各部分事業的增减、已擬定實施方案、這種方案的內容是、一中學師範完成獨立、師範學校合設之高中普通科、中學合設之高中師範科均裁撤不再招生、二省立松江中學、鹽城中學、連雲簡易鄉村師範學校改辦職業學校、預計二十五年度完成三公立宜興職業學校收歸省立、改辦高級農林科、四蘇州工業學校添設紡織機塲及機械科、完成三科、上海中學原辦有商科、並就高師高普兩科畢業班次改辦工科及天才學級、蘇州中學應用化學科揚州中學土木科均加充實、從第一項南中·南女子·上中·松女中·揚中·通中各原有高師科一級、蘇中原有高師科、級均於本年度下期畢業、下年度卽不再招高師科、亦不添招高普科、事實上卽無異减少高普科八級、而南中高普科下年度應自然增設之一級亦予减去、蘇女師原有高普科一級於本年度下期畢業、卽不再招高普科、亦不添招高師科、事實上卽無異减少高師科一級、而錫師·太師·海師·淮師·各原有高普科一級、亦於本年度下期畢業、不再添招高師科、惟各增辨師資訓練班一級、計共减少高普科九級、高師科六級、增加師資訓練班五級、從第二項、松中及鹽中各减普通科一級、增加職業科一級、從第三項、公立宜興職業學校减少初中普通科一級、增加初級農林科一級、從第四項上中减普通科一級、增加工科一級、蘇工增加機械科一級、又自然增加二級、此外宜興陶瓷科職業學校增加初職科一級、石湖·連雲各增加鄉師一級、通盤計算、計减少高普科十二級、初中一級、高師科六級、增加高職科六級、初職科二級、師資訓練班五級、鄉師二級、而連雲鄉師之一級爲漁村師範科、前三年純爲關於漁業方面之職業訓練、後一年始授以小學師資應修之各種敎育學科、爲有志小學敎師者之凖備、以合該地之特殊環境故、事實上亦無異爲初職科、基於這種方案所編訂之二十三年度經費支配標凖、較本年度亦大有變動、計一十三年度經費總額爲二百一十七萬八千一百二十三元、內職業學校佔百分之二五·○二、計五十四萬四千九百零四元師範學校佔百分之二九·五三、計六十四萬三千三百二十三元、普通中學佔百分之四五·四五、計九十八萬九千八百九十六元、較本年度職業學校增百分之五·七九、計十三萬三千餘元、師範學校减百分之一·四○、計一萬七千六百餘元、中學减百分之四·三九、計七萬三千六百餘元照這樣看來、一年以內、對各項敎育經費已有相當的增减、此後逐年應增者增、應减者减、預計到二十六年度尙有三年、當不難達到部頒標準、至縣立中等敎育經費、情形較爲複雜、而且各有特殊的歷史、假如也要照部頒標準支配、這是不可能的、因爲蘇省各縣敎育經費預算、向來是分爲行政費、普通敎育費、義務敎育費、及社會敎育費等項、高級小學及普通中學職業學校經費屬於普通敎育費、初級小學及師範學校經費屬於義務敎育經費、爲防止侵佔起見、各項經費都限制不得流用、倘欲推翻成例、重行支配、則勢必發生困難、加以各縣中等敎育經費有限、很少能兼辦中學·師範·及職業三種學校的縣分、所以關於經費的支配、無論如何不能適合部頒的標凖、私立中等學校加以限制起見、已分别令飭各縣敎育局、所有各縣立初級師範從二十三年度起卽停止招生或停辦、卽以節餘經費添辦鄉村初小、同時將各省立鄉村師範學校的班級酌量擴充、以應各縣小學所資的需求、各縣立及私立中學不得任意擴充、應設法推廣職業學校、並規定辦法數項、卽一、各縣立中學原辦單軌者、不得藉口升學人數衆多擴充學級、原辦雙軌者自二十三年度起逐年减招、至二十六年止五律改成單軌、（二）各縣已辦有職業學校者應設法擴充、未辦者應卽籌設、其經費卽以縮减之中學經費或新增經費抵充、萬一爲經費所限、亦應籌設職業補習學校、爲不能升學之學生訓練生產枝、（三）已立案之私中學其在普通中學設置較多的地方、應督飭勸導减少普通學級、逐漸改辦職業學校或職業補習學校、（四）自二十三年度起、私人籌設中學應卽督飭勸導改辦職業學校或職業補習學校、如或經費不甚寬裕、逕卽勸導改辦小學、以示限制、以上幾種辦法、都是想將縣立及私立中等敎育稍加限制、以免其自然澎漲、今後本廳當本着旣定方針、斟對環境的需要、爲適當之調劑、以求全省中等敎育的適當發展、而防止過去中學及師範的逾分澎漲、使畢業生缺少出路的流弊、同時對於各中學招收新生嚴格限制、非合標凖不得濫取、而對於高中錄取新生標凖、尤特别提高、使中學敎育成爲眞正的人才敎育、本年度全省公私立高中學生入學考試、均集中在本廳、由本廳組織委員會、命題閱卷、統一辦理、這便是兄弟對蘇省中等敎育的信念、還望我蘇人士共諒斯旨、予以贊助爲幸、</p>

<h3>先使白話文成話</h3>
<p>— 夏丏尊</p>
<p>五四以來的白話文、因爲提倡者都是些本來慣寫文言文的人們，他們都是知識階級，所寫的文字，又都是有關於思想學術的，和大衆根本就未曾有過關係。名呌白話文，其實只是把原來的「之乎者也換了「的了嗎呢」，硬裝入藍靑官話的腔調的東西罷了。凡事先入爲主，白話文創造不久，就造成了那麽的一個腔殻，到今日還停滯在這腔殻裏。當時提唱白話文的人們有一句標語呌做「明白如話」。眞的，只是「如話」而已，還不到「就是話」的程度。換句話說，白話文竟是「不成話」的勞什子。</p>
<p>白話文最大的缺點，就是語彙的貧乏。古文有古文的語彙，方言有方言的語彙，白話文旣非古文，又不是方言，只是一種藍靑官話。從來古文中所用的辭類，大半被删去了，各地方言中特有的辭類也完全被淘汰了，結果，所留存的只是彼此通用的若干辭類，於是寫小說時，一不小心，農婦也喊「革命」</p>
<p>婢女也談「戀愛」了。編成戲曲的說白可以使台下人聽了莫名其妙。</p>
<p>舉一例說，現在白話文裏所用的「父親」「母親」二語，就很可笑。實際上我們大家都呌「爸爸」，呌「爺」，呌「爹」，呌「娘」，呌「媽」，或呌「姆媽」，决不呌「父親」母親」的。可是白話文裏却要用「父親」「母親」的稱呼，甚至於連給六七歲小孩讀的初小敎科書裏也用」父親「母親」字樣。「爺娘妻子走相送」唐人詩中已呌「爺娘」了，我們現在倒呌起「父親」母親」來，這不是怪事嗎？</p>
<p>要改進白話文，要使白話文與大衆發生交涉，第一步先要使牠成話。</p>
<p>現在的白話文，簡直太不成話了。用詞應儘量採取大衆所使用的活語，在可能的範圍以內儘量吸收方言。凡是大衆使用着的活語，不論是方言或是新造語，都自有牠的特别情味，往往不能用别的近似語來代替。例如：「揩油」在上海一帶已成爲大衆使用的活語，自有牠的特别的情味，我們如果嫌牠土俗，用「作弊」「舞弊」等話來張冠李戴，就隔膜了。</p>
<p>方言只要有人使用，地方性就會减少。如「像煞有介事」一語，因使用的人多，已有普遍性了。此後的辭典裏，應一方面删除古來的死語，一方面多搜列方言。</p>
<p>放棄現成的大衆使用着的活語不用，故意要用近似的語言來翻譯一次，再寫入文中去，這就是從來文言文的毛病。白話文對於這點雖經痛改，可惜還没有改革得澈底，結果所表達的情意還不十分親切有味。我有一個朋友，未曾討老婆，别人給他做媒的時候，他總要問「那女子是否同鄉人？」他不願和外省的女子結婚。理由是：如果老婆不是同鄉人，</p>
<p>的。這話很妙。現在的白話文，作者與讀者問，等於一對方言不通的情侶，彼此用了藍靑官話來作喁喁的情話，多隔膜，多難耐啊·</p>
<h3>南京通訊「文言復興之自然性與必然性」</h3>
<p>— 小默</p>
<p>海上的「幽默」官司還未了，首都又有文白之爭，由吳研因的一篇替白話小學敎科書辯護的文章，引起好幾篇拿白話做箭垜的洋洋大文，連續在中央日報發表。最惹起我的注目的，却是許塵周先生的「文言復興之自然性與必然性」一文。　第一，這個題目是多麽斬釘截鐵，自然」之後還來一個」必然」，老吏斷獄還沒有那樣咬得實。不過「自然」和「必然」底下都加上一個「性」字，終覺有點碍眼，「性」字當然早已見於經傳，而且爲聖人所樂道，不過，這字自從給日本人糟塌了之後，甚麽「急性」「慢性」「男性」「女性」便成爲𢖼時髦的名詞，尤爲「迷信白話者」所愛用，「自然性」和「必然性」也屬於這一範疇。聽人說維新運動前後，士大夫暗地裏受了梁啓超販運日本名詞的影響，甚麽「趨勢」「影響」等一套話也見於公牘中，連康梁的政敵也有所不免。許先生這個「性」字脚，揆之春秋責備賢者之義，還是去了好，或改作「固然」與「必至」，更是無一語無出處，與蘇老泉之辨奸論媲美、千古了</p>
<p>第二，許先生把白話文在看讀寫作四方面結下的惡果數說了一頓之後，便說，</p>
<p>「夫自民八至今垂十五年，雖幼稚生亦已作大學生或大學畢業生矣，白話敎育之試騐已達一單元，行將周而復始，結果之善否固已大白於天下，倘更不加省察，迷途盲進，同胞皆不敎不學之人，中國爲無敎無學之國，喪亡之期决不待第二單元」，善哉許先生之言，「天道周星，物極必反」之乎者也，旣已倒霉十多年，揆諸盛衰循環之理，呵嗎的了本應壽終正寢，何况其禍延國家呢！　第三，文以載道，古有明訓，文言復興，道亦在其中矣。所以許先生的結論說：「幸哉幸哉，今者幾輩先知先覺，熟察救亡莫先於敎育，敎育莫急於文言，乃一致奮起，努力爲復興文言運動，應事實之要求，作全國之先導，糾正十五年之錯誤，保養四萬萬人之元氣，義不反顧，責無旁貸。夫復興云者，恢復吾國所固有，非甚難之事也。學者須知如此，則治學方有其利器，從前失此器，故所治一無所成，今復尋得之，則一切學術，皆不難迎刃而解。敎者亦須知爲學先立乎其大，者遠者，則其小者近者不能奪也。以輔成學生之美志，政府方面當明白湘粤蘇三省之所爲，係白話敎育試騐失敗後自然必然之革新工作，無一毫與政府歧趨之觀念，實際輔助政府之所不逮，例應明令褒奬，風示國人，不及十年，中國學術，當聞名世界矣」。　其實，許先生意還有未盡，國運本繫於文運，今旣有文起十五年之衰的「先知先覺」如許塵周，翁率平，汪懋祖，柳詥徵幾輩，文言復興，不待著龜，國運興隆，指日可期。諸先生的功，儕於治平洪水猛獸之禹了。</p>
<p>不過，這條上舊下新的八股題，也未嘗不可以照論理學上的逆推理再做一番。卽是說：國運如已有興隆之兆，文運自必昌明，世道人心如已復於三代之舊，則誨盜誨淫貓言狗言之白話亦自必消聲匿跡。按諸近事，紫金山之狼羣不　藏本，雖拜總理在天之靈之賜，然化及豺狼，使大事化小，小化無，實國運否極泰來之兆。跳舞旣懸爲厲禁，游泳復嚴男女之大防，忠孝仁愛信義和平八字之外，復益之以我佛之晻嘛呢叭咪吽六字眞言，世這人心之正也必矣。未有國運興而世道人心不正者也，世道人心正而文言不復興者未之有也。相此運轉鴻鈞之會，許翁諸先生以復興文言自任。許翁諸先生其聖之時者乎！</p>
<p>最後，還要聲明一句，我對於白話本是一個執迷不悟者，本文固有許多地方是爲聖人立言，信筆搖來，也不免之乎者也一番，欠妥之處，還求文言復興的「先知先覺」指敎指敎。</p>
<h3>賣蓆</h3>
<h3>論重譯</h3>
<p>— 史賁</p>
<p>穆木天先生在二十一日的「火炬」上，反對作家的寫無聊的游記之類，以爲不如給中國介紹一點上起希臘羅馬，下至現代的文學名作。我以爲這是很切實的忠告。但他在十九日的「自由談」上，却又反對間接翻譯，說「是一種滑頭辦法，」雖然還附有一些可恕的條件。這是和他後來的所說衝突的，也容易啓人誤會，所以我想說幾句。　重譯確是比直接譯容易？首先，是原文的能令譯者自慚不及，怕敢動筆的好處，先由原譯者消去若干部分了。譯文是大抵比不上原文的，就是將中國的粤語譯爲京語，或京語譯成滬語，也很難恰如其分。在重譯，便减少了對於原文的好處的躊躇。其次，是難解之處，忠實的譯者往往會有注解，可以一目了觭，原書上倒未必有。但因此，也常有直接譯錯誤，而間接譯却不然的時候。</p>
<p>懂某一國文，最好是譯某一國文學，這主張是斷無錯誤的，但是，假使如此，中國也就難有上起希羅，下至現代的文學名作的譯本了，中國人所懂的外國文，恐怕是英文最多，日文次之，倘不重譯，我們將只能看見許多英美和日本的文學作品，不但沒有伊卜生，沒有伊本湼支，連極通行的安徒生的童話，西萬提司的「吉訶德先生，」也無從看見了。這是何等可憐的眼界。自然，中國未必沒有精通丹麥，諾威，西班牙文字的人們，然而他們至今沒有譯，我們現在的所有，都是從英文重譯的。連蘇聯的作品，也大抵是從英法文重譯的。</p>
<p>所以我想，對於翻譯，現在似乎暫不必有嚴峻的堡壘。最要緊的是要看譯文的佳良與否，直接譯或問接譯，是不必置重的：是否投機，也不必推問的。深通原譯文的趨時者的重譯本，有時會比不甚懂原文的忠實者的直接譯本好，日本改造社譯的「高爾基全集」，曾被有一些革命者斥責爲投機，但革命者的譯本出，却反而顯出前一本的優良了。不過也還要附一個條件，並不很懂原譯文的趨時者的速成譯本，可實在是不可恕的。　待到將來各種名作有了直接譯本，則重譯本便是應該淘汰的時候，然而必須那譯本比舊譯本好，不能但以「直接翻譯」當作護身的擋牌。</p>
<h3>淄博印象</h3>
<p>— 羅王</p>
<p>（二）魯大煤礦</p>
<p>我們趁膠濟車行到張店，換張博支路的火車，車行不一小時，便抵淄川站了。</p>
<p>淄川是國內出名的煤礦出產地，我們講演之餘，特往參觀一個最大的礦井！！就是魯大公司的煤礦！！只可惜大好的富藏，實際上已非我有了。</p>
<p>這煤礦距淄川城七里光景，土名大荒地，原是淸時爲曹州殺德敎士，德國人强租去的，直到歐戰起時，日本人又奪了去。據說，當年日本接收該煤礦查看原契約時，才發見我國外交官的糊塗。礦約上載：礦區之大，「東止東山，北止鐵道：：」這裏所指東山，是指「東邊之山一而言，北止「鐵道，」究爲那一條鐵道，俱屬空洞無稽！實際上範圍之大，已抱括了淄川全縣。</p>
<p>淄川煤礦在歐戰停止時，名義上已爲中國收回，改爲中日合辦的公司了，但中國實際上還是領着虚名。據說如今魯大公司的職員，最上層的，如經理恊理和量下層的工人，都是中國人，其餘中層握着實權的全是日人，而所謂經理者流，常是每月拿乾俸，住在大連天津租界上，誰也不明瞭公司的實况，一切全由日人操縱，最氣人的，我們參觀礦區的洋式職員宿舍，一切日本化，只准日本職員住，中國職員非但沒有住的資格，連進去看看也不許。</p>
<p>至於工人的工資和實際生活，誰也打探不淸，問到他們是不會有實話說的，據說，實業部，建設廳，統派人調查過，都没有得到正確的結果。</p>
<p>魯大公司的煤礦，在國內算是有數的礦區，規模的宏大，不亞博山的博東公司之煤。礦井工人的上下用電力升降機，礦深三百多米（一說七百多米。）下百有電車，有馬車。礦井上面有鋼架，通輕便火車，從礦井出來的煤，可以隨時運到另一間選煤廠去選擇，分出等級，利用電力，很快地就裝出，有時上了運煤車，便可加上車頭送上膠濟路的支站。規模確是不差。</p>
<p>在公司的外面，有一個很大的換水池，據說冷水熱水互換，可以省去水的浪費。這是國內鮮見的設備。</p>
<p>淄川產煤很多，專供日本軍艦之用。所以日人對於淄博的煤產視爲海軍生命綫。</p>
<p>到於「中日合辦」的名義，就不過名義而止，實際只是費中國人的血汗挖寳藏獻給「日本帝國」作爲武力侵略之用！</p>
<h3>陶醉罷（波特萊爾散文詩）</h3>
<p>— 蘊文譯</p>
<p>你應該陶醉。那就一切不成問題了：這是唯一的問題，爲了忘掉那「時間」所加於你的重荷！那壓碎你的肩膀把你撳到地下的重荷！你應該不停地陶醉。</p>
<p>然而，用什麽呢？用酒，用詩，或用道德，隨你的便，你只要陶醉就是了。</p>
<p>假如，有的時候在一所宮殿的階石上，在一個壕塹的綠草上，在你的室內的憂鬱的狐獨中，你醒來了，你的醉意已退或者完全消失了，於是你向那風，向那波浪，向那星，向那鳥，向那時鐘，向一切在奔馳的，向一切在歎息的，向一切在流的，向一切在歌唱的，向一切在談論的問是什麽時候了：那風，那波浪，那星，那鳥，那時鐘，都會答應你道：「這是覓醉的時候啊！爲了不願做那『時間』的痛苦的奴隸，你陶醉罷；你不停地覓醉！用酒，用詩或者用道德，隨你的便！</p>
<h3>私奔（一）</h3>
<p>— 匈牙利·沛妥斐著施詠沂譯</p>
<p>『但是我們將到什麽地方去呢？』</p>
<p>『到蒲達披斯去』</p>
<p>『到披斯去嗎？』</p>
<p>『當然！』</p>
<p>『爲什麽到那兒去？』</p>
<p>『那裏是最安全的地方。』</p>
<p>『好的，』</p>
<p>『早些！！』</p>
<p>『我就要去準備了！！早的。』</p>
<p>『什麽都得謹愼些。』</p>
<p>『不用愁。』</p>
<p>『不要太遲了。』</p>
<p>『當然不會的！』</p>
<p>『再會，安娜，親愛的！！』</p>
<p>可憐的安德羅，這時他在俱樂部裏，以一種勝利的態度，正對着他的敵手說；『將！』好像他自已生平沒有被人家『將』住過似的，但是安娜是他的妻子，卡爾是他的侄兒。</p>

<h3>糧食期粉變動力奇强</h3>
<p>如是傳聞之漲因</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈混亂盤旋、漲跌均速之象、開價時以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌七八角、坎拿大跌二三角、本月份至八月份開價卽跌一分外、惟至九月份以下、因買氣不退、投機甚狂、不跌而反好、所以二盤後、本月份開價卽提二分、形勢且成軋空、最高至一角八分、以後月份、亦步步提高、但至三盤、因多頭回出甚湧、近遠均然、因此人心轉虚、回跌甚速、此種景氣、完全爲投機者之予取予求、致市面亦漲落靡定也、迨至下午開盤、交易仍見盛暢、市面亦倐好而倐跌、本月份中途又抬至八分左右、後以多頭回出、小至六分、遠期市面、比較尙平穏惟查市塲形勢、因大户多頭、均爲本埠銀錢帮、此後之操縱、仍所難免、且背境複雜、甚少正當之推衡也、結果本月份較前日收價、仍跌半分、七月份跌一分、八月份跌一分七厘半、九月份跌一</p>
<p>分、十月份跌一分半、十一月份跌半分、</p>
<p>市塲傳聞目下粉市高漲、其起因固爲內外阜荒所促成、而亦大粉商始終爲多頭之主體、不顧實銷如何、小麥之年景如何、步步收買、聞銀錢帮買數已達三百萬至三百五十萬包、（達紗布證劵帮）如果再買、則交易所籌碼將三分之二盡在其手中、如是、果如所傳、則　步市面、將無理由可談也、</p>
<h3>近漲遠平的期麥</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈近漲遠平之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥雖回跌七八角左右、坎拿大跌二三角、惟以天時依然亢旱、毫無雨意、內地麥價、亦受投機影響、步見喊高故　價後、市面仍見兇惡、本月份因交割之故、雖交易不多、形成軋空、收盤開至六角四分、七月份以後、則業外空頭、紛紛抵進、市面又見良好七至十月份計又好五六七分、十一月份則見平平、迨至下午開盤、本月份初價仍硬、後以多頭回出、驟見暴落、開收之差度、達一角分之巨、其餘月份、因粉市轉鬆、市氣亦軟、各月份較上午回跌甚巨、最後結果、本月份仍跌六分、七月份微好二分、八月份好二分、九十月份小一分、十一月份小五分、現麥市面、到銷兩旺、市價高貨又提三五分、中次平平、開蚌埠麥三元一角一分、角、明光宿千麥三元一角、至一角二分、浦口麥二元八角七分、至九角二分、瑤灣麥三元一角、大橋無錫麥三元零五分、蕪湖麥二元九角二分、次八角八分至八角三分、丹陽太州麥三元、南京麥　元八角半、次八角、由福新辦二萬四千</p>
<p>包、華豐辦六千包、信大辦三千包、</p>
<h3>回籠洋米步漲角外</h3>
<p>昨洋客秈市况、本客辦胃續旺、因天時乾旱、人心向上、客帮胃口甚貪、本街內地亦紛紛問津、且有囤户活動、市面更形挺俏、昨開出湘贛皖機秈二千六百七十一包、漢口沙市糙米六千包、市價均比前日步升六七分至一角不等、回籠洋米昨開小絞五千包、初開七元六角、繼逐步上升</p>
<p>至七元六角七分、比前市較大一角二分、由本街內地北洋及福州分去、洋米且有囤户問津、因目下市價雖漲、但比日前市價尙低、一部分人心則</p>
<p>看高至八元、</p>
<h3>河下米市混沌</h3>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源三十餘號、（貨共近五千石）</p>
<p>銷塲晚稻包胃自昨市一度猛漲後、較爲呆頓、共辦祗有靑角松江等貨五六百包、市形較覺淸淡、惟行情則以天氣奇旱、人心尙堅、是仍續升數分、後市有希望耳、各帮厚粳店胃人心不穏、故雖無多大胃口、而動輒向上、如常帮蘇同南港等貨價續增尺許、惟杜洋尖則以旁門花色較無輕重、猶　定局、陰變　平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各路來源六七號、河下存船祇九十號、市上各貨銷雖淡化、然客心堅固、市形高白粳又加二三角、薄稻白元杜埠尖價加一二角、羊客尖加數分至近角、</p>
<h3>糖市片靑慘跌七角</h3>
<p>▲天熱防變：忍痛斬出五百餘箱</p>
<p>昨糖市以關金步跌、且聞减稅消息、或有實行可能、人心恐慌、市象紊亂、公會劃盤如二四號粗砂白討價二十元、受主寥寥、太古Ｂ嘜喊二十元零四角、皆未做出、本廠一號綿白十八元九角、降一角、零星成交、會州白續開三百餘包、價十七元至十六元八角、北海片靑糖前號存數千箱、均扳而不售、際比天氣炎熱、久儲防變、故不得不忍痛斬出、昨開出五百餘箱、價爲十一元零一角、比前慘跌七角云、</p>
<h3>絲茶浙屬夏繭將上市滬絲廠陸續開工</h3>
<p>（吳興夏蠶可望豐收）吳興各市鄉農蠶、因今春多育改良種、春繭價雖小而虧本、而土種餘存頗多、飼育夏蠶、以補土絲原料之不足、天氣和暖、蠶蟻發育順利、早帮三眠足葉、若天時不起變化、則夏繭又可望豐收、</p>
<p>（五絲廠又繼起開車）蘇浙春乾繭運滬日益暢達、繭身優厚、繅折不大、而絲廠繅絲車租金從前每部須銀三兩、今歲祇洋一元、故一般絲繭商紛紛租廠繅絲、除已開工之豐泰等二十五廠外、今美租界阿白司拉脫路源裕及閘北美豐等五廠、又繼起先後開車、尙有十餘廠、出月初旬、亦可開機工作、</p>
<p>（華紗美銷益無生氣）紐約天氣醋熱、美絲織廠預備提早履行暑假、存絲尙厚、需要益淸、華絲美銷益無生氣、各歐莊亦以半年結賬期近、現絲進胃益淡、昨祇信孚等進黃白粗絲十六包、價仍趨疲、</p>
<h3>蝦目珠茶法銷活動</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、平水路莊土莊等路之蝦目珠茶、法莊去路業已活動、永興杜德錦隆同孚等行、均因國外來電需求、紛起搜辦、交易尙不寂寞、屯溪莊貨、頂盤售開一百十二元、其餘亦較前無多上落、平水大帮綠茶、美莊仍續搜辦、路莊珍眉、亦均隨到隨銷、遂安莊貨、市盤業已回漲四五元、至祁寗兩湖等路紅茶、英俄兩莊去路、依然暢達、市盤一致堅定、茶市趨勢、益臻穏固</p>
<h3>油市白桐油漢市轉漲</h3>
<p>白桐油先因漢口洋行停辦、市面逐步回鬆、時約兩週、由三十元零四角跌至二十八元、而價經低落、當然引動買心、據最近各洋行辦成二三百噸、價格自一十八元一角屢增至二十八元六角、市情轉機之速、殊令人無從捉摸、大有瞬倐千變之勢、總之今庚非往年可比、因產額大减、故洋莊市面如在二十七八元、卽可認爲最低限度、若三十元以外、當然呆木、斯亦年令使然也、漢價旣經轉機、浙桐亦隨聲附和、據昨蘭溪來電、謂已加至每砠二十五元八角、則較前亦已漲起七八角矣、本埠號家存積不厚、故滿望稍有回鬆、絡繹辦進、以厚底積、然市情一經變遷、則所希望者又成書餅矣、幸銷路未動、尙堪從容而圖也</p>
<h3>南北貨金針菜新貨將到</h3>
<p>金針菜以銷路暢達、市上陳貨已售罄、茲據漢口函訊、新鄭州金菜刻已登塲、約十天後可以運申、以業中人推測、處此各帮需要方殷、預料售價須在二十五六元左右、</p>
<h3>五金馬口鐵銷路銳减</h3>
<p>馬口鐵近來銷路日見减少蓋烟草公司印鐵廠·製罐廠等、均因霉汎關係、胃口銳减、而熱水瓶廠筍廠等、均爲落令之期、竟無問津、出口生意更難捉摸、故市情完全趨於呆木、雖各同業想竭力維持、但終以環境不良、實銷不起、現市行情則因定價步漲、故尙能擯持、如美貨九十磅每箱售十五元七角半、一百磅估十六元五角、雙運則九十磅開三十二元、一百磅開三十四元、德貨九十磅售十五元、一百磅估十六元、雙連九古磅售三十元零五角、一百磅三十二元七角半、英貨法貨則均斷檔、故無市可記述耳、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>投機與識時</h3>
<p>— 岑樓</p>
<p>投機是一個最壞的名詞。投機的人，往往爲人所瞧不起。如政治上之投機，便爲政客。政客是一般人所最深惡痛的人。此外在商業上，在社會上，投機的人，往往非常之多。尤其是在商業上，一般靠投機過日子的，除開投機，幾乎就無商業可做。這又當置之别論。至於社會上的投機，則一般的往往不易看出。如社會潮流向右，他也就向右，向左，他也就向左。是左是右都不管，只要於他個人有利，他是無時不可以「隨風轉舵」的。這就是一種社會上的投機。這還是從根本方面說，至於其他小節，一般人也多抱着很深的投機傾向。如今日盛行研究國際，他就變成一個國際問題研究專家，同樣，如明日盛行研究中國，他同時又可立刻變作一個中國問題研究專家。根本他對於國際對於中國，究有多少研究呢？，其實都很平平，所知道的，也不過是一些皮毛而已。然而他總歸要自命爲國際或中國問題研究之專家。這是爲什麽？爲的是可以借此騙錢吃飯。騙錢吃飯，是他們所以要投機的唯一根源。投機的本來目的，原不過是爲騙錢吃飯而已。這才是他們所以要投機的由來。此外在社會上所表現的投機情事很多，只要我們留心，隨處都可遇到。總之，投機是這個社會的骨髓，不投機就無法可以吃飯，這樣，投機在這個社會所以就特别盛行。</p>
<p>然而與投機同時並行的，還有一個「識時」。這怎麽樣解釋呢？兩者的區别何在？投機是極壞的，然而同時識時又是很好的。古人云，識時務者爲俊傑。</p>
<p>究竟這識時與投機有什麽不同之點。這倒是一個很有趣的問題。</p>
<p>照我看，這兩者並不難解釋，就是一則爲私的，一則除個人以外，還能認識社會。如投機，他的最高目的，至多不過是爲自已造地位，可以過着更好的生活：然而識時就不同，他的目的，並不在增高個人地位，而是在個人以外，還能認識社會，知道社會大勢所趨，看淸楚歷史演變的必然途徑，從而投身社會，跟着這個歷史的潮流，向前衝擊。這樣才是眞正的識時。識時與投機的不同之點，就在這一點。兩者的區别，就是在是不是認識社會，或是僅爲個人。其所走方向雖不同，而行徑則有多少相似。失之毫釐，差以千里，這裏面我們實不能不加以嚴重的區别。</p>
<p>投機是沒落的。只有沒落的社會，才會產生投機的事情。而「識時」則是前進的。在這變亂的社會，每一個人都應有識時的本領。識時能導你前進。那裏是正當的途徑，只有識時才能使你認淸。我們需要識時，而同時我們必需嚴重的打擊投機。投機能使人沒落。那裏是我們正當的途徑，靑年們應認淸着。不要怕歷史的磨鍊，每一個英勇有爲的靑年，都應該隨着時代潮流的前進，而不斷的向前衝擊的。</p>
<h3>鹽城底女人國</h3>
<p>— 效坎</p>
<p>我國因了交通不便利的原故，因之有好多古怪底事，湮沒而不聞於世，甚是可惜。上月間，友人唐海安君因公赴鹽城，順便到海畔上去游覽。不意在一班海畔底人民口中，發現了女人國底奇聞。昨天唐君回滬，遂很興趣地，詳細地，告訴給咱知道，不揣譾陋，撮述如下：</p>
<p>地點：鹽城雖然是一個黃海邊的城池，其實距海尙有二百多里的遥。北面入海的有新洋港，南有斗龍港，此二港在吾國漁業上很有重大的關係。一至秋天漁汎過後，漁舟回來的時分，那二港數十里之間，簡直完全被漁舟佔滿了。鹽城的人民，一半是業鹽，一半是業漁：都肯茹苦含辛的工作，所以無衣食之憂。靠新洋港港口的地方，有一個週圍十里底小鎭。這一個小鎭，便呌花船港，也便是今天咱所要說底女人國。　命名：這個花船港怎會呌起它女人國來呢？原因是鹽城到海邊，交通太不方便，除了小車之外，便沒不别的東西可以代步，牠的速力很慢，一百餘里的長途，事實上一天不能推到。然而除了出東門外及過北門閘的近郊，稍有一點住家，其餘全是沒有人烟的地方，倘使半途上推不到，簡直是要發生絶大的危險，居住花船港上底人民，完全是靠漁爲生。一到黃花魚汎的光景，每户十歲以上底男子。誰都要上船南航，至滸浦，瀏河，：這些地方去捉魚，直到廢歷九十月方回來咧。！！在這半年的當中，這花船港的鎭上，止有女人守家，由是成爲一個古怪底女人國了！</p>
<p>沿革：大約在兩百年之前，新洋港邊本沒有這一個小鎭，因爲交通太不方便，這些漁民底家眷，住在附郭，感覺到二十四分的困難，因爲始有一部份漁人，在海畔建屋居住，先起只有寥寥三四十户人家，後來漸漸的繁殖，到現在差不多將近千户了，於是遂命名做花船港。慢慢地和鹽城隔離，無異成了武陵底桃源。而且，那兒底子女，亦從不同外地人結婚姻的。</p>
<p>政治：在那裏旣譚不到政治，也</p>
<p>譚不到法律，可是，要是說自冶吧？又沒有這樣的組織。警察局，保衛團的設立，更可不消說得了，如遇海盜搶刦，合村的人就奮不顧身，執械抵抗，死都不管的，所以海盜不敢存覬觎之心，光蒞他們的鎭頭，那兒爲的生活簡單的緣</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>故，談不到科學，也沒有敎育，所以較之别地底人民，要天眞的多！爭論毆打的事情，也絶少發生，假若有了什麽案件，終在該鎭漁帮公所！是在那裏開會討論的最高機關！！公平調停，兩造皆肯聽從解决。</p>
<p>耗費：這一個小小的鎭上，雖沒有一井完善底舖子，然而她們底繡房中，却佈置的異樣宣麗矞皇，并且什麽孩兒面呀！明星皂呀！香水精呀！月宮粉呀！等等著名的化妝品，也應有盡有的，原來這些東西，都是她們丈夫南航時在别處　回來的，可是她們在鎭上耗費的楷會，便極少了，祇有廢歷正月天生日，二月地后娘娘聖誕日，她們雇戲班演了幾齣戲，闔鎭底人，發狂似的娱樂了一日，别的就沒有了。</p>
<p>神秘：那裏的女人，非特個個截髮時裝，而且秀色可餐，在她們丈夫上船以後，半年之中，全是成爲一個女人國，花前月下，能不動情？空幃孤衾，孰克遣此，以是城中一般無產階級的窮光棍，多放膽到花船港去。不但可以得到錦衣玉食的優待，還有肉的享受，在這時期，設使去了一個男性，她們是一百二十四分的歡迎，簡直要演出百女奪夫底事件來，直至他們的丈夫瀕將掉船回來時，那一些狂蜂浪蝶，便被她們逐出飛散了。</p>
<h3>都會裏的僧人</h3>
<p>— 建</p>
<p>當我搬來這兒的時候，最使我注目而驚奇的是左邊的一座古庵與對過的一爿跳舞塲，相峙抗對，那種耐人尋味的情景。但我畢竟是一個粗心浮氣的人，撇開眼線以後，也就對它不假思索了。要不是事情爆發得這麽快，要不是逵媽那樣津津有味的詳細告訴我，我也仍然會「了無所知」事情大致如此：</p>
<p>这古庵裏，托鉢爲活的僧人，足足一打，而且個個是成年壯丁，也許困爲平日煙火淸素豐足，而又不大担心世事，又個個都長得肥碩晳白，矮個子的，像一些冬瓜。</p>
<p>其中有一個僧人，禪名覺人，據說是衆僧的統領，每日似乎很忙碌，如若有人問他爲什麽那麽忙，他是有很多的道理解說的。我也曾經會過他一二面，人矮矮的，三十歲模樣，那雙流轉的眸子，最使人注意而懷疑。他愛講書理，說笑話。使我略略有些不滿意的是他曾經向我遊說，要我做他的徒弟，我說可不可以帶老婆　　子，他就問難道你年輕輕的就有了老婆麽？餘下是掉頭一聲長嘆。我也就從此有些不高興他，間斷往來了，</p>
<p>他有一位年輕的禪夫人，但曉得他有這一着的人很少。他的秘密的工夫鍊得很深，她常常托名到庵子裏來進香，其實是尋他訴情，其他的和尙都不大明白。至於他出去會情人，那自然是絶沒有人知道的了。</p>
<p>聽說只有一次幾乎漏露了消息。這是自然的道理，僧人得有了禪夫人，也必致生育兒女，有一天他的兒子進庵訪爸爸，其他的和尙都注目而視，幸喜他轉圜得快，說是義子，才平安過去了，</p>
<p>不知是什麽時候，他的禪夫人竟一病不起，與他永訣了。正是所謂中年喪偶，至足悲痛，他當然是萬分的難過，但又苦情無處訴，只得把淚水往肚裏咽</p>
<p>近來覺人和尙才稍稍寬慰些，有個證明，就是他忽發講究起袈裏來了，</p>
<p>每每笑逐顏開的說袈裟必要那種料子，那種裁法。甚至有人見他在外面是穿着平常人的漂亮衣服，但他自已是絶對的否認，說是歹人故意中傷，惡心破壞他的名譽。</p>
<p>上星期的一天晚上，有人看見他在對過跳舞塲門口插身過，這消息傳到了庵子裏，大衆都眉毛直豎起來，覺得是非同小可的大禍。但他慢慢的踱回來，毫不介意的對和尙們訓斥了一頓，大有子見南子後向學生子路賭咒的情况，　然而事情畢竟暴露了。覺人和尙確曾上過對面的跳舞塲，不過他究竟和舞女伴跳過沒有，則不得而知，據舞塲裏的賬房說，他只到那裏問過有沒一位姓裴的舞女，確實沒有上樓去。</p>
<p>而今事實的展開，倒是他快要與一個姓林的寡婦結婚了，這新聞簡直傳遍了遠遠近近，他的熟人，無不知曉。到這時候，他自已也沒有多話說了，他向一些徒弟表明，他要移居到另一個庵子裏去了，首先是要帶走一部份財產，和尙們都破面不答應。只准他搬帶行李。　不料剛搬出門，就給一羣不三不四的人圍住一頓亂打，而且被蓋都被搶走了，而且人眞的受了重傷。</p>
<p>後事則不得其詳。</p>
<h3>發財</h3>
<p>— 馬嬰</p>
<p>阿發是個老實人，只曉得努力做田地，從來就沒有想過怎樣去發財。村裏人個個都贊他會幹，阿發也從沒有擺出過驕傲的顏色。</p>
<p>可是一連幾年，得不到一個好年成，水災，旱災，兵，匪，還是苛捐，雜稅，連成七八條陣綫圍攻到農村裏來。在這種情形下。農村是破產了。</p>
<p>年老的整天嘰哩咕嚕地發牢騷。年靑的悶聲不嚮地便望都市裏跑。</p>
<p>阿發生這種厄運下，已經負上了一身債。那從來未曾在他心裏發現過的思</p>
<p>想第一次撞上他的心！！怎樣去發一注財，還淸這筆債，救救這些老的小的吧？</p>
<p>終於被他找到一個機會了，那是在航空奬劵行銷到這村裏來的第一天。阿發向人借了一塊錢來買了一條。雖然那天離開奬的日子還遠，可是他的心裏感到從未有過的高興，好像不必開奬，那頭奬准是他的了。</p>
<p>孩子哭起來，阿發過去抱他，吻着他的瘦頰說：「别哭！再過一個月，爸爸簽財了，許多鈔票，買糖。」</p>
<p>老頭子和他的女人不贊成，可是</p>
<p>阿發不去管他。他耐心的等着，等着阿發期待的那一天，終於到來了，又過去了。阿發跌進失望的深淵裏。　老頭子氣得滿面發紫，嘮嘮叨叨地說：</p>
<p>「想發財！白丢了一塊錢，還要加」</p>
<p>息：：：</p>
<p>「丢那媽」！</p>
<p>阿發把那張航空奬劵撕做兩段，丢</p>
<p>在地上，恨恨地踏了一脚。</p>
<p>孩子從外面跑進來，把那兩段花花綠綠的紙拾在手裏，望着阿發嚷道：「爸爸鈔票，買糖」。</p>
<p>「放你媽的屁」！</p>
<p>一脚踢開那孩子，衝到門外去。</p>

<h3>下井</h3>
<p>— 孟君</p>
<p>淮北什記之一</p>
<p>淮北的夏天，熱得實在有些可怕，假使可以這樣講的話，我一定要說准北所有的是另一個太陽。在春天，好像和江南的太陽沒有多太差異，待一到夏季，情形就太不同，簡直從早晨牠露面起到下午西沉爲止，沒有一天不是在牠能力範圍之中施放最高度的熱到大地上來，那裏離着海洋稍遠，所以沒有海洋氣候能達得到調和這燥熱的空氣，那裏沒有高大的山。能稍微擋去些這第二太陽的熱力，更沒有大川長江來潤潮這乾燥的地土。淮北，在别的種種上都很不壞，就是因爲以上諸項的缺乏，到了夏天實在令人可怕。記得我第一年在准北過夏的時候，實在因爲受不住這樣的灼熱的緣故，曾有一回躱避到枯井裏歷十分鐘之久。那時候，什麽使我起這個動機的，我已不能記得淸楚，但在井裏的情形以及下井的方法我不會忘記，下井的方法講出來也簡單得很，一根粗繩，一隻木桶而已，但是下去的時候。並不是呌了許多人拉着繩子我坐在桶裏慢慢的放下去，而是我一人先在井面上把繩子扣住在樹根上，一頭給着桶放入井內，再在我自已頭裏掛了個手電筒，電筒頭朝下，捺这了，兩手先在井口抓住繩子，隨後兩足伸進井裏，便一手換一手的朝下降。這時，縱然繩子不比槓子是硬的，但是因爲降勢，無論如何要省力得多安穏得多，何况胸口還掛着隻捺亮的電筒。一手一手的往下降着降着，終於達到了一頭結木桶的所在，我並沒有數從井口到桶上往下降時一共換多少手，否則，我也會計得很牢的，但是，反正這繩子掛在井裏大約是三丈就算了。</p>
<p>其時，辰光不是正午，太陽稍偏了點西，所以井裏異常黑，要看井裏的一切非用電筒照不可。當我用電筒往下照的時候才知道我所坐着的一隻木桶離井底還有約三四丈高，井底儘長着些呌不出名字的雜草，但那些給人丢下去的廢物委實不少，井的四圍長滿的都是靑苔，除了這些東西之外，我簡找不出别的奇異之物。我抬起頭來看，立刻覺得我好像鑽在望遠鏡裏邊，因爲從一個離我有三尺遠的井口，我看出去，見天上的雲，一朶朶的輪廓異常淸晰。</p>
<p>井裏的溫度，我可以說冷得有逼人，但是最令我不能再忍受的，就是井裏一股濃厚的氣味。我幾不能形容這是股什麽樣的氣味，可是我想信這股氣味必定和掘開的墳墓裏的氣味不相上下。那時我未始不打算在井裏的時候再耐久些，而這股氣味已不容我這樣做了，於是我便站起身子，手抓住繩子往上升。這次却比不得下來時候那麽省力了，雖然光綫是從上面照下來的，並且我事前把電筒頭朝上用繩子挪住在胸前，繩子可以看得很淸楚不致失手，但那軟軟的繩子，經我的手往上一收，便一搖，這樣是最容易還失手的，這時候才覺得有些然險了，可是沒有辦法，非得往上爬不行。眞要謝天的保祐，手沒有失，臂膀裏的力氣也接得上，這樣才算爬出了井，而身上已是一身的大汗了。</p>
<h3>關於「哭親」</h3>
<p>— 光宇</p>
<p>在Ｍ縣地方，有一種怪奇特的風俗。凡是曾經配過親了的女孩子，遇到她未婚夫的爹或媽死了的時候，她便得帶着孝趕到夫家去，向着她那名義上的公或婆的靈位，痛哭一塲，用來表示她對於在生前和自已還沒有發生過甚麽關係的公或婆的一點孝心，這就所謂「哭親」</p>
<p>這是誰都不能否認的。一個在生前和自已沒有絲毫情感可言的人死了，要自已同情他，甚而至於痛哭他，是多麽不自然而又摧殘自已意志的事。！！不然的話，除非那個死者，是生前和自已有切膚關係的人。</p>
<p>一個還沒有和自已的兒子結過婚的名義上的兒媳，根本就缺乏和自已發生情感的機會。現在竟因自已死了的緣故，便强制她來向自已發生同情，同情了不够，還要進一層的呌她來痛哭自已，這更是謊謬而又强人所難的舉動。</p>
<p>在Ｍ縣地方，通常死了一個老頭子或老婆婆，要是這老頭子或老婆婆有兒子的話，就有人關懷地問『死者的兒子可有配過親？　如果死者的兒子有了未婚妻，那麽那個閒話的人，就會從他的臉上露出一種羨慕的神色說：『這樣的死，也不算寂寞了，他有「哭親」的兒媳了呢！』反之，假如答他一聲「死者的兒子，還沒有配過親。」那麽那個問話的人，更會立刻沉下臉來，嘆着氣說：『死者枉做了一世人，在最後一刹那，連這「哭親」的媳婦兒都沒有，是多麽的不幸呀！』</p>
<p>從這現象看來，足見「哭親」這回事，在Ｍ縣地方所佔有特殊的勢力了。</p>
<p>更可怪的，在處女時期的女孩兒家，本來是很害羞的。但生長在Ｍ縣的女孩子，她們早把「哭親」這回事，看得比專制時代的帝王的聖旨還誠重了，所以身當其竟的在「哭親」的女孩子，能够把她們處女所固有的害羞心暫時丢開，很自然地去同情她那在生前和自已無絲毫情感可方的公或婆，對她公或婆的靈位去痛哭，並且能哭出好多的令人聽了酸鼻的腔調。至於處於旁觀地位的女孩子們，在發現某地方死了一個人，有人在「哭親」的時候，那更不必說，一定會東邀阿姐西邀妹的，「不遠千里而來」的去看一個究竟。而且她們看罷了回來，在歸途中還能大家評論起長短來。像那女孩子的姿勢不好，腔調到可以，聲朗也不壞：：等都是的。有時，她們高興了，更會把剛才所聽到的，大家來哭着玩呢！這不是一椿可怪的事嗎？</p>
<p>我到過Ｍ縣，並且也親眼見過所謂那「哭親」這把戲。我覺得這是値得我們來提出討論！！在這擴張女權聲中！！的一個社會問題。</p>

<h3>不能再過辱駡的日子</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>九歲時，父母卽領我到學校裏去受敎育。在十歲的春天，我母親生了疾病，不到一月，就一命嗚呼了！我的父親到了秋天，因爲我還是幼童就娶了第二個母親，當心我的飢飽和寒暖。父親出外做生意之後，家裏祗有她和我二個人。奉了她的命令，將家裏我能够可以做的事體，都歸我做，完了以後，才可以去讀書。否則卽白眼辱駡，有時想拷打的形狀也做出來了。我名義上雖入學校，實則讀書的日子，每月祇有二分之一。父親回來之後，她還要告訴，說我專心遊玩，不肯學習文字。後來讀了七年書，父親看我年紀已長，讀書不能步步</p>
<p>上進，又爲了家境淸寒，就託了朋友，</p>
<p>薦到本埠工廠裏來了。做了一個工廠練習生，也沒有先生，現在已有六年了，家裏我還沒有去過一次。不料去年秋天，我們廠裏的廠長掉換，我做事那部份，也沒有主任，由廠長直轄管理。現在每月賺六塊錢，生活非常齷齪。現在每天五點半就要上工了。爲了噉飯和經濟壓迫，當然沒法可想，不過現在做的事體稍有點不好，廠長開口就駡，連陰間的母親也被他帶在裏面。我在廠中，單身獨帮，全廠三百個工人和職員，十分之七都是他自已介紹來的，所以我一人被他辱駡，毫無辦法。我的母親，早已去世，爲何亦要被他駡呢？所以我的心中，朝暮不安，想託朋友介組别的事，又爲了時勢不好，失業工人日多一日，亦是困難。倘使回到家中，更沒有顏面見父親和現在的母親和鄰舍的人們，加着父親失業，家貧如洗，决不能讓我坐食。就别的職業，本領一點也沒有，幹不來。我不能再過辱駡的日子，所以進退維谷，恐怕祇有黃浦中，是我安身的地了。親愛的先生你或許可以爲我解决難題，我在祝禱着等候着你答復我這個要求。祝你撰安金玉浩</p>
<p>答：我們固然要尊重自已的人格，對於旁人無禮的侮辱，不能過於隨便，一味忍氣呑聲，我們應當積極的提出反抗，然而在過到侮辱的時候，却應當自已先思考一下，看這種侮辱對於你是不是眞正一種侮辱，看這種辱是否是「自取的。」須不是「自取的」，須眞正是一種侮辱纔提出抗議，若不是如此，也氣憤塡膺，聲勢洶洶的提出抗議，就太無意思。固然，你廠長對於你的辱駡確是一種侮辱，但他辱駡中帶到你母親，卑鄙下流已是自喪人格，這簡直同惡狗狂吠一樣，對於這種人根本我們不値得理會。你祇要仔細自已去反省一下，看有無「自取的」成分在內，如有，以後就謹愼一點，使他無話可說，如無，那你就儘可不管，因爲這是他自已喪失人格，</p>
<p>决不能算作是你的恥辱了。</p>
<p>進一層說，卽使要對於這種侮辱反抗的話，那也應當由全體工人去做。你一個人怎有力量去反抗廠長呢？去做，就是傻子。廠長對於你的無禮的辱駡，以及你因勢孤力單而不能反抗，這都不是你個人的恥辱，而是全體工人階級的恥辱。你廠裏的全體工人，爲了要保持工人的地位和尊嚴，是一定要用全體工人的名義提出抗議，因爲這不僅是爲你個人打抱不平，更不是義俠行爲而是爲保證廠長藉其權勢地位無禮壓迫工人起見，必定要用全體力量來做的抗爭。這一點你明白之後，你就應當趕緊把祇有「黃浦中，是你安身的地的念頭打消，」</p>
<p>也不必認爲是個人的事而單從個人方面去謀解决辦法了。編者</p>

<h3>節母坊（十二）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>有一個暮春的晚上，屋頂上的猫在呌得十分討厭。她睡在床上静悄悄的睜開眼皮，房子的四圍，像墳墓中一樣的可怕。窗外的暖風，好端端的吹開了一扇紙窗，從那裏瀉進來糢糊的月亮的白光，夾在春風中飄蕩，有如一襲輕紗，軟柔柔的撫摩着她的胸膛，使她的呼吸不由的感覺急迫。她用力在床上翻動着。而床也是那般寬大空虚。但是當她接觸着兒子的身體之一部的時候，她却感覺有了保護，同時她也感受一種神秘的力，使她的心更加跳得可怕。她意識到睡在脚下的便是自已的兒子，他從族叔那兒回來，現在就已經睡得很熟了。而且立刻使她想到，那個年靑美貎的族叔，大槪現在也已睡了吧。不過他是否，就睡熟了呢？一想到這裏，就有死去了的丈夫的手，在嚙住她的心，使她覺着很痛，差不多立刻就要破碎似的。於是她掙扎着，她勇敢的坐起來走下床來，她手捫着胸走到窗前，一陣暖風拂在她的臉上，醉薰薰的使她退坐在梳妝台的椅子上去。她懶洋洋隨手拿起一面銅鏡，在糢糊的月光中，她照着臉上掛着兩條淚痕。不過沸騰了的血液還不能使她安静，何况窗外還不住的流進來濃厚的玫瑰花香。雖然她深知道自已是守節十來年的寡婦，然而維繫着寡婦之信念的鐵鍊已經給她將澎湃的血液漲斷了。於是她不管丈夫的音容在眼前閃爍，她披着衣向族叔那兒跑去，推開了那終年不打開一次的門，走到他的房門前敲着門。跳躍着的心，幾乎要跳出喉頭。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang, along with his wife Soong May-ling, arrived at the Ming Palace Airport at 10:45 AM on the 26th, and took a Ford plane to Hangzhou. Only Secretary Wang and two attendants, along with one female servant, accompanied him. Before his departure, Chiang met with Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi. It was merely a routine courtesy visit and did not involve political matters. Premier Wang received a telegram from Chairman Chiang in Hangzhou at 4:00 PM on the 26th, stating that he had arrived in Hangzhou at 12:00 noon. (26th Dispatch)</p>

After alighting from the train, Ariyoshi and Suma and others rode in Japanese consulate cars to the Japanese Consulate-General in Nanjing to rest. According to Arino, who spoke to reporters at the station, Ambassador Ariyoshi's visit to Nanjing to meet with Premier Wang had no important matters. It was purely a routine trip.

The ambassador expressed his gratitude to the Chinese authorities for capturing the Zheng and Vice Consul. As for various issues between China and Japan, the ambassador had no preparations to discuss them on this trip. He did not meet with Mr. Huang Yingbai in Shanghai. Furthermore, after Ariyoshi arrived in Nanjing and learned that Chairman Chiang was still in Nanjing, he telegraphed the Military Commission, requesting them to forward a request to Chairman Chiang to arrange a time for a private visit.

Secondly, he said that he had heard that the Chinese customs import tax rates would be revised, which would have a significant impact on Japanese commerce. He also expressed the Japanese side's opinions on this matter. Apart from that, he did not mention any other events. As for the North China issue, Ariyoshi has never mentioned it to Wang until now. According to reporters, Ariyoshi attached great importance to our country's implementation of the new customs import tax rates on July 1, believing that Japanese goods would be greatly affected. However, our side believes that the revision of tax rates was drafted by the Legislative Yuan, and the date of implementation is only a few days away, and there will be no changes due to the Japanese side's expression. As for the through train issue, according to diplomatic circles, it should be realized on the first of next month if there are no special problems within a few days. The through train method has been set and will be announced in Beiping. Regardless of whether the travel agency is named Pingliao or Dongfang, as long as it does not have the word "international", it can be resolved. There is still no news when Huang Fu will go to Ping.

This visit was also a routine visit. The ambassador visited Wang in the afternoon to express his gratitude for the safe recovery of Deputy Consul Momoto. Regarding the North China issue, I have repeatedly said that it is a local event. At present, the director of the Beiping-Ning Road Bureau, Yin Tong, is proceeding with the consultation with the Kwantung Army in accordance with Chairman Huang's intentions. The embassy has not intervened. The ambassador will return to Shanghai tonight. Whether or not he will go to Beiping will be decided after it cools down in the fall.

<h3>Song Zheyuan Visits Kong to Report on the Financial Situation of Chahar Province; Qin Dechun Talks About Zhang-Kulun Transportation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan had drafted a report on the financial situation of Chahar Province, describing in detail the various tax revenues and expenditures of Chahar Province. This morning, Song, together with Qin Dechun and Guo Zhihan, went to Fengzeyuan to visit Kong, presenting the report and giving a detailed oral report, talking for about an hour before taking their leave. Qin Dechun said that Chahar Province was originally a remote area, and the income was very small. After the closing of the financial conference, the provincial government had followed orders and selected 13 kinds of harsh and trivial taxes to be abolished by decree. If there are considerable subsidies for the remaining items, it is not difficult to reduce them. However, Chahar Province's monthly income is very small, and expenditures are difficult. Even based on the current situation, there is still a shortfall of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per month. Without considerable subsidies, it is not easy to reduce them. After the restoration of transportation between Zhangjiakou and Kulun, several German-Chinese Trading Company cars transported goods from Kulun to Cha, and on the way back, they transported inland products to Russia. At present, Chinese merchants are also using this route for commercial transport. The Russian side had previously requested to use Zhang-Kulun for trade. The provincial government has forwarded this to the central government for approval. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Offering a Few Words for the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>Recently, the authorities have called for the New Life Movement. Therefore, from government agencies to the streets and alleys, all sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce, academia, and the military have responded to it like grass bending in the wind. This kind of expression cannot but be said to be a sign of national awakening. In recent years, the people's spirit has been declining, and the people's morality has been deteriorating. The trend of greed, inferiority, licentiousness, and debauchery is even worse than in the late Jin and Ming dynasties. If we can be inspired in time and each person encourages himself, enriches his own strength, and adjusts the actions of the whole country, then self-improvement is hopeful, and the trampling of foreign tribes may be avoided. Otherwise, the disaster of destruction is imminent. Under the blade, we will seek to be slaves and not be able to. We want to use the New Life Movement to awaken the national soul, but how can we expect caged birds to fly?</p>
<p>The main purpose of the New Life Movement is to maintain the people's hearts with propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. It brings the four things of human life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—into the norms of the Four Cardinal Principles, so that all the tools of livelihood and the methods of action have standards to follow. Taking it must be with righteousness, using it must be with propriety, serving the public must be with integrity, and guarding oneself must be with a sense of shame. All things that are impolite, unrighteous, without integrity, and without a sense of shame are not to be done. If we can be like this, then officials will have no corruption, merchants will have no fraud, workers will not steal or reduce their efforts, and students will not extravagantly display their extravagance and bury their heads in hard work. If the whole country is of one mind, then the deterioration of state affairs and the degradation of society will never reach the extreme of today.</p>
<p>Today, the people of the country seem to have realized this. However, the most important of the Four Cardinal Principles is to be clear about shame. Without shame, there can be no propriety, righteousness, integrity. Many people talk about the New Life Movement, but abandon its true meaning. There are also those who follow the words and hope for the truth, echoing what others say. There are even those who cater to fashion, borrowing the name of the New Life Movement to join the ranks of modern people. Their words and deeds do not match, their appearance and inner selves are inconsistent, they do not cultivate themselves and regulate their families, and they only deceive with big words. The upper levels follow suit, leading the people of the country to hypocrisy. We want to connect people's hearts with the Four Cardinal Principles, but people's hearts become more scattered. We want to renew the lives of the people of the country, but life becomes more difficult. All of this is caused by the existence of deception and the lack of clarity about the word "shame." If shame is not understood, how can we govern? How can we teach war? To talk about the New Life Movement in this way is not like slogans such as "Unity and Coherence in Spirit," just providing bureaucrats and politicians with another term?</p>
<p>The ancients had a saying, "Humanity is sensitive to politics." In the past, our national customs have always been that if the superiors have a good, the inferiors will be even more so. "King Chu loved slender waists, and many starved to death in the palace. The city liked high coiffures, and the four directions raised them a foot." Therefore, at this time when the whole country is calling for a new life with each other, the actions and words of the leaders are enough to change the perceptions of the people of the country. The effect of personality influence is greatest. People call Gandhi's residence not sheltering from wind and rain, Lenin governing, his clothes still worn, and Mussolini and Hitler all using hard work and self-encouragement as their example. Looking back at our country's history, how many people have been able to practice integrity and set an example, since Zeng and Zuo to the present, in the past hundred years? This is what the leaders of all sectors should first encourage themselves to do today.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that the key to the New Life Movement does not lie in how lively the propaganda is, but in whether the leaders can follow it. It does not lie in how complete the regulations are, but in whether there is sincerity in practicing them. It does not lie in demanding perfection from others, but in being strict with oneself. It is a necessary principle to travel far from near and to climb high from low.</p>

<p>(B) Matters for discussion: (1) Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance submitted three measures to compensate for the reduction of land tax surcharges and the abolition of miscellaneous levies: (1) The first measure is for each province and city to first tighten its budget and eliminate extravagant expenditures to save funds. (2) The second measure is for each province to increase revenue after consolidating its taxes. (3) The third measure is for the central government to allocate all tobacco and alcohol license tax revenue to local governments, and to allocate 10% of the flower tax revenue to the provinces, 30% to the counties, and 20% to assist remote and impoverished provinces. The request for review and notification to all provinces and cities to comply was resolved, approved, and sent to the Secretariat of the Central Political Council for submission and record. (2) Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance submitted six principles resolved at the National Financial Conference regarding the reduction of land tax surcharges and the prohibition of temporary fund-raising levies in various localities: 1. After the land survey is completed in each county, if the reported land price can be used as a basis for taxation based on value, it should be divided into several grades according to the reported price, and an average price should be determined for each grade, with a tax rate of 1% as the principle. All surtax items should be abolished, and the distribution of the tax revenue should be based on the principle of 40% for the province and 60% for the county, and may be adjusted according to the local conditions of each county. 2. Before the land survey is implemented, if the land tax in each county cannot be levied according to the reported land price, the original tax categories should be simplified and merged into new grades for levy, but the surcharge should not exceed the total amount of the original regular tax. In areas where the original tax categories are light or extremely heavy, the regular tax and surcharge should be combined and should not exceed 1% of the land price. 3. The existing land tax surcharge, whether it exceeds the regular tax or not, should not be increased for any urgent need or under any pretext from the 23rd year onwards. 4. Temporary mu taxes and levies in various counties, townships, districts, and towns should be strictly prohibited. 5. When the surcharge collection period expires or the original target no longer exists, it should be abolished immediately and should not be used for other purposes or continued to be collected. 6. If the current land tax surcharge exceeds the regular tax, it should be reduced within a time limit, and the increased tax amount from the land survey should be used to offset the reduction of the surcharge. The request for review and instructions to comply was resolved and approved, and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for separate handling. (3) Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance submitted a request to order all provincial and municipal governments to immediately order local banks established without prior approval from the Ministry to register with the Ministry in accordance with the regulations and detailed rules for bank registration, and to limit the recall of any banknotes that have been issued. In the future, if any provinces or cities need to establish banks, whether they are government-run or jointly run by the government and private sector, they must not be established without the local government's request to the Ministry for approval and registration and obtaining a business license. If any illegal business operations are found without approval, they should be ordered to suspend operations immediately. The request for review and implementation was resolved, approved, and ordered to comply. (4) The Nanchang Provisional Headquarters of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission sent a letter stating that for the convenience of suppressing bandits, it is proposed to transfer Guangze County, which is under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province, and Wuyuan County, which is under the jurisdiction of Anhui Province, to the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province, with a simple map attached, requesting the competent ministry to make a decision, and requesting the transfer to the National Government for review and to the various Yuan and Ministries for reference.

<h3>Anglo-American Naval Negotiations Enter a Waiting Phase; Awaiting White House Response to British Proposals; General Observation is that Hopes for Compromise are Slim; Japanese Navy, Army, and Foreign Ministries Study Proposals</h3>
<p>(London) The Anglo-American naval negotiations have now entered a waiting phase. However, the US chief delegate, Davis, is currently consulting with President Roosevelt by telegram. It is expected that the US delegate is merely waiting for the US government's response to the British exploratory proposals. The US side has hinted that the United States, during its economic recovery, may allow Britain to temporarily restore its naval superiority. The European side now believes that the chances of success in the Anglo-American discussions are very slim. Some parties even expect the expansion of naval and air forces to occur imminently. It is believed that today's discussions are only to determine the total amount of funds to be used and the percentage that each military service should occupy. It is generally believed that the French authorities are now seeking to abandon part of the Washington Treaty and demanding that their capital ships not only be equal to those of Italy, but also equal to the tonnage jointly held by Italy and Germany. British Prime Minister MacDonald had a private conversation with Davis today, focusing on procedural issues for the conference. As for the expansion of armaments, many people believe that MacDonald may not serve as Prime Minister again. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After the cabinet meeting today, Foreign Minister Hirota consulted with Navy Minister Osumi on the naval arms reduction conference, focusing on Ambassador Matsudaira's report. (Japan Associated Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Navy Minister Osumi, he has telegraphed Ambassador Matsudaira that the preparatory consultation seems to be limited to the date, location, and agenda of the conference. If there are separate discussions between the United States, Japan, and France involving technical issues, there should be some degree of discussion. At that time, written instructions may not be sufficient, so the dispatch of specialized committee members will be discussed. Due to geographical reasons, the Empire needs to decide on the location of the conference in advance. As for the Navy's attitude, the goal is to change the existing ratio, achieve a sense of independent national defense security and equal rights, and deal with the conference with other goals.

<h3>British Demand for Military Expansion; In View of Japan's Expanding Power; The United States May Not Insist on Opposition</h3>
<p>(London) A political reporter for the Manchester Guardian, citing reliable sources in the United States, said that the British Admiralty has now proposed building 70 cruisers to protect the sea lanes of the British Empire. The tripartite conference held in Geneva in 1927 failed due to this demand and greatly affected relations between Britain and the United States. It is said that this demand today may not alarm the United States as it did in 1927. The United States, in view of the increasing expansion of Japanese imperialism, now itself desires to have greater freedom in naval matters, so it may not oppose the British demand. However, regardless of the naval conference next year, the naval program within the scope allowed by the treaty will soon be expanded, and Britain will especially propose a plan to double its air force strength.

<h3>Russian Ambassador to Britain Delivers Speech on Good Neighbor Policy, States Willingness to Maintain Peace with Germany, But Will Resolutely Repel Any Border Violation</h3>
<p>(London) The Russian Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, delivered a speech at the National Peace Conference in Birmingham today, generally stating that Russia desires peace. The claim that Russia wants to encircle Germany, start a war against Germany, or initiate hostilities against any country is absurd. Regarding Germany's foreign policy, peace is the most important principle. The Russian Ambassador mentioned the non-aggression pacts that Russia has signed with many neighboring countries, stating that what Moscow regards as regrettable is that Russia's attempts to conclude similar treaties with Japan and Germany have ultimately failed. If Russia is attacked, Russia will be able to inflict heavy damage on the attacker. (26th Dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, when the United Federation of Leagues of Nations Support Groups in Britain held a peace conference in Birmingham, the British and Russian Ambassadors to Britain, Maisky, attended the event to explain the Soviet Union's attitude towards international issues. Liberal and Labor Party opposition newspapers took this opportunity to express their opinions, stating that any peaceful construction project cannot succeed outside of the League of Nations, and that Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov's inclination towards international cooperation is the most comforting indication of international policy. The Daily Herald stated that the policy advocated by the Soviet Union is most suitable for the interests of both the League of Nations and the Soviet Union, and all those who advocate peace support it. The reason why the League of Nations has achieved so little in practice up to now is that the Soviet Union and the United States have not participated. Therefore, in any case, the international policy of jointly maintaining peace must be maintained, promoted, and enriched. The Soviet Union's assistance in this regard would be welcome. The New Chronicle stated that at a time of turmoil, it is a significant event that a representative of one of the three or four strongest countries in the world openly declares that their government purely hopes for peace, and for lasting, eternal, and unlimited peace. Moreover, it is noteworthy that Soviet Ambassador Maisky's speech was friendly towards Germany. (26th Dispatch, Havas)</p>

<p>●Yugoslav Capital　Foreign Minister Jevtić hosted a banquet for French Foreign Minister Barthou in the evening. During the banquet, Mr. Jevtić delivered a welcoming speech, first stating that the arrival of the French representative was welcome. The emotions of the descendants of the Southern Slavic people towards France will be forever engraved in their hearts. He stated that France's efforts for peace have been long-standing and commendable. Yugoslavia and France share a common policy of peace and respect the freedom of other nations. The friendly relations between the two countries should never change. Barthou rose to respond, saying that he was deeply grateful for the warm welcome he received in the Southern Slavic country, both on the Danube River and in the capital. He also said that Mr. Jevtić's expressions towards France were sincere and unforgettable for any French person. People of both countries can be said to be kindred spirits. Twenty years ago, when the Great War broke out, the Southern Slavic and French nations faced the same fate, and the people of both countries fought together, shedding blood on the battlefield to defend the freedom of both nations. After the war, the national fortunes of both countries have improved, which is deeply memorable. The treaty we signed in 1927 is a great diplomatic constitution for establishing permanent national relations between the two countries. The determination of the two countries to cooperate fully to eliminate all threats is evident in this. Barthou concluded by saying, "Your country has a wise government which, under the guidance of a wise king, can accomplish peaceful achievements with prudent and resolute actions. This is what I am deeply pleased about." (25th Dispatch, Havas)</p>
<h3>Opposition to Treaty Revision; Barthou Criticized by Hungarian Figures; Nationalists Burn Images to Vent Anger</h3>
<p>●Budapest　The Hungarian representative to the League of Nations, Igart, published an article today, criticizing the French Foreign Minister's disregard for good faith. He particularly criticized the French Foreign Minister's recent statement in the Romanian capital that the Treaty of Trianon cannot be revised, saying that former French Foreign Minister Millerand solemnly declared when signing this treaty that the injustices caused by the treaty could be revised later. Foreign Minister Barthou's statement today is inconsistent with the spirit of Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant, and he criticized Barthou as a representative of France's backwardness, unable to cooperate with other countries to establish a reasonable compromise.

<h3>Secret Military Agreement Between Turkey and Greece</h3>
<p>●Rome After Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece signed the Balkan Pact this year, some said that Turkey and Greece had also signed a secret military agreement within the scope of the Balkan Pact. Recently, a news agency here received news from Thessaloniki, Greece, confirming the rumored secret military agreement. The Pan-Hellenic Labor Daily commented on the matter, saying that the Balkan Pact is of no value without Bulgaria's participation. However, if Bulgaria participates, Greece and Turkey fear that the power of the Slavic elements in the Balkans will increase. Therefore, the military agreement between the two countries stipulates that if something happens, if it is initiated by Russia, Turkey will be released from all obligations; if it is initiated by Italy, Greece will be released as well. The newspaper concluded by saying, "The Balkan Pact is full of reservations, but it can prove that the Balkan countries are engaged in military preparations and are establishing military alliances, which does not seem to improve international relations."

Regarding concerns about religious matters, Goering said, "If religious groups cannot maintain order on their own, the state will intervene. The German people will not allow religious disputes to disrupt the country for long. We will never attack any doctrine, but if the church wants to interfere in politics, we will clearly declare that the time when the church ruled Germany through the power of the Center Party has passed.

<h3>United States Issues Silver Certificates</h3>

<h3>Italian Fleet Suddenly Arrives in Albania; Over a Thousand Sailors Land Unarmed; Claimed to be a Friendly Visit</h3>
<p>Albanian Capital The Albanian government information office issued a statement stating that twenty-two Italian warships had arrived in Albania on an informal visit and had arrived at the port of Durazzo on the 23rd of this month. (26th Dispatch, Havas)</p>

It arrived and anchored there on Saturday. At that time, the Albanian authorities had not received any notification. The next day, more than a thousand Italian sailors landed unarmed. The Albanian government then asked the Italian ambassador for an explanation. The response was that this was a social gesture. The Paris Echo also reported that when the Italian warships appeared off the coast of Albania, French Foreign Minister Barthou had just arrived in the Yugoslav capital from Romania, hoping that this matter would not be compared to the Agadir incident. (Note: Agadir belongs to French Morocco in Africa. In 1904, Britain and France reached an agreement whereby France gave up all its rights in Egypt, and Britain gave up its rights in Morocco, as an exchange condition. In the same year, France also signed a treaty with Spain, stipulating the spheres of influence of the two countries in Morocco. In 1911, German Emperor Wilhelm II was dissatisfied with France's expansionary policy and, under the pretext of protecting German nationals, sent the gunboat "Panther" to Agadir to exert pressure.)

Afterwards, the Italian fleet sent an officer ashore to notify the port police station, saying that the Italian fleet's arrival here was a friendly visit. However, the naval soldiers did not land, and the warships left Durazzo port after berthing for twenty hours, sailing to an unknown destination.

Naval Minister Monsell replied that the Shuntien incident was a type of inland piracy. Shipping companies have recently hired their own armed guards, who are managed by the Hong Kong police. This method has been in place for three years and is quite satisfactory. In addition to setting up guards, iron gates are also installed on ships, but this equipment is limited to merchant ships in the South China Sea. Merchant ships in North China do not have this equipment because North China has never encountered piracy. He believes that the equipment used on merchant ships in the South China Sea should also be applied to merchant ships in North China in the future. Before 1931, when merchant ship guards were not yet set up, the authorities did provide naval and army soldiers to protect ships, but this was a temporary measure. He believes that there is no need to restore the previous system at present, but the local naval and army authorities know that it may be necessary to send troops to protect in special emergency events. Merchant ships sailing from Shanghai to North China on June 19 did have soldiers on board for protection. If the authorities must automatically supply naval and army guards for merchant ships, the troops stationed in China will be insufficient. He is very willing to cope with everything within the power of the Navy Department, but he cannot agree to automatically allocate naval and army soldiers as guards for merchant ships. MP Fremantle asked whether the actions of the British aircraft carrier "Eagle" have shown the great value of air strikes for policing. Naval Minister Monsell replied that this is a very good model of cooperation between the British Navy and Air Force. (25th Dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Yemen-Hejaz Peace Treaty; Cairo; The peace treaty between Yemen and Hejaz was announced today in Mecca, Sana'a, Cairo, Damascus, and Kust 동시에. The treaty is officially named the Treaty of Taif and is valid for twenty years. Outsiders call this a treaty of peace and friendship. What is of interest in this treaty is the change of borders. The treaty states that the two countries will unite as one in the future, and diplomatic officials will also unite as one. Both countries will benefit commercially from this treaty. Hodeidah has now been returned to Yemen, and Najran and Yam will belong to Hejaz forever. (25th Dispatch, Kokumin)</h3>
<p>(London) In March of this year, war broke out between Hejaz and Yemen in the Arabian Peninsula, which lasted until mid-June. On the 19th, representatives of the two countries signed an agreement in Hodeidah on the Red Sea coast, stipulating that the status quo in southern Arabia would be maintained, with a validity period of twenty years. The text of the agreement between the two countries was recently announced here. This treaty is to restore lasting peace. The two countries mutually recognize independence, and neither side will build fortresses within five miles of the border. The border between the two countries will be clearly demarcated. In the future, disputes between the two countries will be resolved through arbitration procedures. Anyone who engages in political conspiracies within the territory that are detrimental to the other country should be punished. In addition, measures should be taken to prevent desert bandits from invading. King Ibn Saud of Hejaz and the King of Yemen agree that they will not participate in any actions that could harm the interests of the other country. If either signatory country has a conflict with a foreign country, the other will remain strictly neutral, but will provide moral assistance. (25th Dispatch, Havas)</p>

<h3>Strict Governance in Soviet Russia: Seven More Officials Executed for Corruption</h3>
<p>Leningrad – Seven more Soviet Russian officials were executed here today. This is part of the measures taken after the joint trial of the previous case of corruption and malpractice by Soviet civil servants. A total of fifty people were implicated in this corruption case. The origin was the embezzlement of public funds by the Danzi Keqi Sailuo cooperative store. In addition to those already executed, seventeen more people were sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. Furthermore, a sensational corruption case will be investigated at the Binlosk court this week. Among the defendants are three directors of the famous Novgorod Museum.

<h3>New Work of the Sino-British Cultural Organization in London</h3>
<p>(London) – According to the annual report released today by the China Committee of the Universities, China House will be renamed Chinese Institute. Chinese students in London have long disapproved of the old name, saying that it is tantamount to regarding China as a self-governing territory of Great Britain. The annual report also stated that the old regulations are no longer applicable, so new regulations have been adopted. The financial situation of the association is also satisfactory. Recently, donations have been received from several people, including £75 from Mr. Chen, £62.10s from Mr. Liu, and £1,000 from the Boxer Indemnity Custody Office. In addition, John Swire &amp; Sons Ltd. will provide an annual donation of £500 for three years, so that a representative of the China Committee can travel to the UK and contact Chinese students in various places. In 1933, the committee established seven scholarships for Chinese students. This year, it added two more with £1,250, and sent seven Chinese students to British machine factories for apprenticeship with £500. British manufacturers added £546 to this funding. The committee is now considering sending several British students to study in China and seeking to exchange Sino-British lecturers. At the same time, it is also heard that agricultural expert Mr. Steer Echren will go to China soon to stay for a year and initiate the work of rural cooperatives.

<h3>Ancient Tomb Discovered in Egypt</h3>
<p>Cairo – Field workers from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, currently excavating prehistoric remains in Mardi, Egypt, discovered a tomb today containing the corpse of an adult woman. Her skull is larger and fuller than any skulls found from the pre-dynastic period of Upper Egypt, proving that the Nile Delta region was once inhabited by a people whose physique differed from that of the original people of Upper Egypt. In addition, the excavation team led by Richt discovered the tomb of a woman named Ha Han, which contained jewels, perforated beads, pottery idols, a razor, an ivory scepter, and four exquisitely carved ivory figurines in dancing poses. All items are very complete, which is rare. (Special Telegram from Zi Lin Bao, 26th)</p>

<h3>Severe Disaster Situation in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>Disaster reports received from thirty to forty counties</p>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs requested relief from the Central Government</p>
<p>Changsha correspondence: Since the beginning of spring this year, various counties in Hunan Province have been reporting disaster situations one after another. The types of disasters are extremely inconsistent. Twenty-five counties, including Lanshan, have been affected by drought, resulting in missed spring plowing. Fourteen counties, including Pingjiang, bordering Hubei and Jiangxi, have been ravaged by bandits, leading to displacement and death. Ten counties, including Anxiang, have experienced flash floods that swept away fields and homes. Seven counties, including Jingxian, have been plagued by widespread cattle plague, resulting in many deaths and making it impossible for people to plant. There have also been cases of drought, flood, and cattle plague occurring in succession, combined with epidemics. After careful examination, the situation is extremely dire and has a severe and significant impact on rural society. Now that the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, it is further compounded by man-made and natural disasters. How can the surviving people endure this? Although local gentry and merchants have tried to provide relief, the disaster is too severe and the area too wide. Without substantial funds, it is impossible to cope. Therefore, the Department of Civil Affairs and the Provincial Relief Committee have recently submitted detailed reports on the disaster to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Central Relief Committee, respectively, requesting the issuance of large-scale relief funds to Hunan for widespread assistance. The following is a transcript of the document submitted by Cao Bowen, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, to the Ministry of Internal Affairs: "Since the beginning of spring this year, disasters have occurred frequently in various counties of Hunan Province. The various disaster situations suffered by Xinsi, Linwu, Hengyang, Ningyuan, Jiahe, Cili, Lanshan, Guiyang, Daoxian, Fengxian, Anxiang, Wugang, Yueyang, Qianyang, Changde, Baojing, Xinhua, Zhijiang, Xupu, Leiyang, Xian County, Liuyang, Jingxian, Xinning, Huitong, Suining and other counties, as well as the city of Changsha, have been reported in previous reports. As of the 15th of this month, the following counties have submitted follow-up disaster reports: Yizhang, Wugang, Rucheng, Anren, Changning, Leiyang, Yongxing, Xian County, Chenxian, Zixing, Qiyang, Heyang, Zhijiang and other thirteen counties. The following counties have submitted follow-up flood reports: Linwu, Xiangxiang, Pingjiang, Sangzhi, Nanxian, Huitong and other six counties. Among them, the disaster in Linwu is particularly severe, with estimated losses of movable and immovable property exceeding one million yuan, and more than one hundred men, women, old and young drowned. Zhijiang and Baojing counties have submitted follow-up reports of cattle plague. Although we have separately ordered each county magistrate to supervise local gentry and merchants to earnestly find ways to maintain order and have also discussed relief measures with the Relief Committee, the disaster is too severe, the area too wide, the government too poor, and the need for funds too great. After several periods of war, vitality has been depleted. The people, originally wealthy, have no means to support themselves. I can only express my helplessness in the face of this difficult situation. I am not only at a loss for ways to provide relief, but also at a loss for words to offer condolences. With a heavy heart, I can only look up to the sky and sigh. I believe that when people are sick, they cry out to heaven; when their hearts are grieved, they cry loudly. I have no choice but to appeal to Your Excellency, begging you to issue large-scale relief funds to save the dying people and to console the hopes of the living. I am filled with urgency and await your orders. All follow-up reports on the disaster situations in various counties of this province, together with the report, are hereby respectfully submitted for Your Excellency's review." (21st)</p>
<h3>Shen Siqi and Others Report on the Inspection of the Seawall Project: Two Points of Discrepancy, Three Points for Discussion</h3>
<p>Shen Siqi, Min Ruizhi, and others recently completed their inspection of the Jiangnan seawall project and submitted a report to the Construction Department, stating: "Respected Director, we have been given the various detailed rules for material preparation and construction of this Jiangnan seawall project, demonstrating your meticulous planning and practical approach, for which we are deeply impressed. On June 12th, we accompanied Jin Tigan, the magistrate of Songjiang County, to the construction site to inspect the wood and stone materials, which were almost completely transported, and the bridge work had also begun. However, after examining various aspects, there are discrepancies with the principles you set, and after assessing the situation, there are also points that should be discussed regarding materials and labor. We respectfully list them below:</p>
<p>Article 1 of the material preparation rules states that the wood used for this project is divided into Qianbanma Zhangba Tong (7-cun diameter when pulled), Zhangwu Tong (6-cun diameter when pulled), and Zhang Tong (5.5-cun diameter when pulled). Article 5 states that when the wood materials are delivered to the construction site, the inspectors will encircle and measure each one according to the specified quality, length, and diameter. Article 3 of the construction rules also has provisions for encircling and measuring each piece. This time, the material preparation followed the usual practice and the established rules of the lumber industry, using a circumference ruler to encircle and measure the size of the wood. After checking, the Zhangba Tong (7-cun diameter when pulled), encircled by the Qianbanma circumference ruler (calculated at the middle section), should be 1 chi and 7 cun of the circumference ruler, which is approximately 7 cun on the Luban ruler and 7.7 inches on the English ruler. However, the Zhangba Tong delivered by the Zhengda Lumber Company that is currently being encircled and measured has a diameter of mostly less than 1 chi and 7 cun, approximately 1 chi and 5 cun. This is the first discrepancy, that the 1 Qian ma size does not match the specified Qianbanma. The Zhangwu Tong and Zhang Tong also mostly do not meet the specified sizes. After inquiring with the personnel involved, it was said that the inspection of the wooden piles was based on the contracted handling, only measuring the diameter of the large end face in inches, without using a circumference ruler to encircle and measure the middle section. After checking, Article 2 of the contract does indeed have this provision. However, the lumber industry's established rules for diameter are to measure the middle section. The size difference between the middle section and the root section (i.e., the large end face) is quite large. The root section may be oval or arc-triangular, making it difficult to accurately measure its diameter. If the inspection of wood this time changes the usual practice and changes the middle section to the root section and the circumference ruler to English inches, then why do the detailed rules have the provision for Qianbanma? Furthermore, the winning bid price is much higher than the current market price in Shanghai. (The middle section of Taiba Tong is 1 chi and 5 cun, which is 1 Qian ma, and the price is 2 yuan and 2 jiao per piece according to the Shanghai market price. The current price is 3 yuan and 3 jiao. The middle section of Zhangwu Tong is approximately 1 chi and 3 cun, which is 6 fen ma, and the price is approximately 1 yuan and 4 jiao. The current price is 1 yuan and 9 jiao 5 fen. The middle section of Zhang Tong is approximately 1 chi and 1 cun and a half, which is 4.5 fen ma, and the price is 1 yuan. The current price is 1 yuan and 2 jiao 6 fen. This is the first point of discrepancy.</p>
<p>Article 2 of the material preparation rules specifies Jinshan stone or Ningbo stone for the boulders. However, after checking, the stone materials delivered by the contractor, Da Xing Company, are Hengshan Huaqing stone, with very few large pieces. Most of the boulders weigh less than 30 pounds. This stone is transported from Hengshan, which violates the specification for Jinshan or Ningbo stone. Furthermore, the market price per cubic meter of Hengshan stone transported to Shanghai is only 1 yuan and 4 jiao. How can the price per cubic meter reach as much as 4 yuan and 4 jiao 5 fen when transported from the coastal highway to the construction site? This is the second point of discrepancy.</p>
<p>The construction rules specify that Zhangba Tong should be used for the first layer of piles, Zhangwu Tong for the second layer of piles, and Zhang Tong for the third layer of piles. This is a slope-type design, decreasing sequentially, which is the most legitimate. However, the third layer of piles, which is the level water pile, is the first to be impacted by the tide and waves, and its depth into the soil cannot be shallow. If Zhang Tong of 4.5 fen ma is used, it is both flimsy and only has a length of 3.40 meters, which, after removing the stones on the beach, means that the pile body is less than 1 meter into the soil. Therefore, this wood is not used in the usual practice. This is the first point for discussion.</p>
<p>The construction rules specify that the boulders should be stacked in the first and second layers, distributing the sizes to form a slope of 1:2 to 1:3, which is very precise. However, the existing stone revetment inside the first layer of piles mostly uses fragments, with few large stones. The uneven arrangement has not been compacted, causing the support for the first layer of piles to lose its stability. This is the second point for discussion.</p>
<p>In the usual practice, the labor cost for driving each Zhangba Tong pile is 5 jiao in ocean silver, Zhangwu Tong is 4 jiao even, and Zhang Tong is not used. This time, the labor cost is 7 jiao 5 fen for Zhangba Tong, 6 jiao 5 fen for Zhangwu Tong, and 6 jiao for Zhang Tong. Currently, eleven or twelve piling workers form a team, and each team drives approximately 30 Zhangba Tong piles per day. The daily wage for each person is more than 2 yuan. According to the detailed rules, the top layer of piles cannot be more than 0.25 meters above ground, meaning that the depth into the soil should be more than 3 meters. At this rate, the depth into the soil for Zhang Tong will be less than 1 meter, and it is also a thin material of 4.5 fen ma. Each team can drive eighty or ninety piles per day, meaning that each person can earn more than 4 yuan per day. If there is no fraud or mixing of materials in the first two layers, the labor cost is already too high. If the third layer actually uses Zhang Tong, using high labor costs to create superficial work is even more unworthy. This is the third point for discussion.</p>
<p>The above points are because, in light of the dangerous floods of the "September 18th" incident of the previous year, the breaches are still present. Although the inner protective embankment is only a little over 1 zhang, the disaster is imminent, and even discussing it makes people pale. Now that Director is seriously addressing coastal defense and meticulously establishing rules, we fear that the materials or labor may be shoddy, failing to uphold the benevolent policy of protecting the people and alleviating their suffering. Therefore, based on what we have observed and what we, as experienced administrators, have seen, we have respectfully presented our views for your consideration. We hope that you will provide instructions and guidance. We respectfully wish you peace and prosperity. Respectfully submitted by Shen Siqi and Min Ruizhi, June 15th, 23rd year."</p>

<h3>Yang Yongtai's Speech at the Security Conference</h3>
<p>Nanchang Telegram, 2nd of this month. Yang Yongtai delivered a speech titled "Overall Review of the Second Security Conference and Improvements to Security Work Going Forward". The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Yesterday, everyone's work reports proceeded very smoothly. Two days of work were completed in one day. Now, according to the conference's agenda, I will briefly summarize everyone's reports. Then, we will ask the Chairman for instructions, and after the instructions, the meeting will be adjourned. The meeting scheduled for this afternoon will not be held.</p>
<p>Last year, at the first security conference, many provincial security chiefs attended. Now, more than a year later, we are holding the second conference here. The scope is larger than last year, and more personnel have been invited to participate. Yesterday, I listened to everyone's oral reports, which were very detailed, and they were supplemented by written reports, which were even more clear and comprehensive. The results of everyone's efforts from last year to this year are highly commendable. The content of the security work and the progress of the security work are clearly presented before us. Regarding seeking reforms and improvements, everyone has already provided very valuable suggestions. Some are common requests from various provinces, and some are unique needs of one or two provinces. In about one day, we conducted a general review of the security work in eight provinces, which can provide the Chairman with very important references and can be used to determine the future direction of promoting security work. This time, everyone gathered in Nanchang to exchange ideas and learn from each other. We are confident that when the third security conference is held next year, there will definitely be greater progress. The headquarters and various provinces, as well as the provinces among themselves, will be able to benefit greatly from this conference. Now, according to the nature of everyone's reports, we will classify them, draw conclusions, and based on these conclusions, determine the path we should strive for in the future.</p>
<p>First, the issue of names. A total of ten provinces were summoned to Nanchang for this meeting. Among them, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces have not yet established a security agency system. Only eight provinces attended this time. However, even among the eight provinces, the names of the security agencies are inconsistent. For example, the agency in the province responsible for security is sometimes called the Provincial Security Office, and sometimes the Provincial Security Command. At the level below the province, some districts have established security branch offices, while others have established security command posts. The titles of branch chiefs, deputy branch chiefs, district security commanders, and district security deputy commanders are often different from each other. As for the county level, some have established general regimental headquarters, some have established general brigade headquarters, and some have established battalion headquarters. Not only are the names of the security agencies inconsistent at various levels, but the names of the troops are also inconsistent. Some are called defense regiments, and some are called security teams. The name "defense regiment" comes from the defense regiment law promulgated by the Ministry of Interior. The name "security team" comes from the regulations for the reorganization of the Republic promulgated by the Three Provinces Headquarters. The simultaneous existence of these two names is really inappropriate. After this meeting, there is a real need for unification. Because agencies and troops of the same nature have various different names, it is easy to confuse people. In the future, to ensure that the name reflects the reality, we must first rectify the names. Even if we cannot completely standardize everything immediately, we must at least strive for general uniformity. The name "defense regiment" no longer needs to continue to exist. "Defense regiment" is a general term for local militias. According to the current situation, it can include "able-bodied teams," "communist eradication volunteer teams," and even "security teams," whether they have firearms or not, they can all be called "defense regiments." Now, the security teams in various provinces all have firearms and have a well-organized structure and system, almost like regular troops, so we should not use this simple term again. I recently went to the front line for inspection. The armed teams in Jiangxi are still called defense regiments. However, in the past, defense regiments had various bad impressions in the local area and had lost the trust of the people. Although the organization has been changed, the name has not been changed, making it difficult to shift public opinion. When the army and the defense regiment are placed together, there is inevitably a traditional sense of looking down on them. Even the defense regiment itself often feels inferior, thinking that their ability and courage cannot match the army, and they are not treated equally, which is predetermined. In fact, the defense regiments on the front lines are not much different from the regular army. Everyone has weapons, and everyone receives a monthly salary of seven or eight yuan. If you call them security teams, they are soldiers; if you call them defense regiments, they are militiamen. This difference between "soldier" and "militiaman," although only one word apart, is very significant. Because if the name is not correct, it will affect the self-confidence and sense of responsibility of each member. In this suggestion, most people advocate unifying the name and organization, which shows a similar vision. After the Chairman approves it, we should immediately make corrections.</p>
<p>Second, the issue of organization. After reviewing the current organization of teams in various provinces, they are generally divided into two types: (1) those directly under the provincial security agency, which are generally called security regiments; and (2) those not directly under the provincial security agency but under the jurisdiction of the county, which are sometimes called county security teams or county defense regiments. These are not uniform, and the co-existence of provincial and county jurisdiction is most common. In Hunan Province, all security teams are directly under the Provincial Security Command, reaching a very high stage of team unification. According to the report of Acting Commander Li yesterday, Hunan Province has made great efforts and overcome many difficulties to reach this stage. It can be said that Hunan is the most advanced province in the reorganization of security teams. We plan to divide the process of reorganizing teams into four steps. The first step is that the previous defense regiments belonged to districts, townships, and towns, and even to a single village or family, completely a fragmented and divided state, all controlled by local tyrants and evil gentry. Local officials had no way to intervene. Since the promulgation of the Regulations on Reorganizing Local Militias the year before last, this chaotic situation of fragmentation and territorial disputes has gradually been broken and improved. The organization, training, deployment, personnel, and management have gradually been unified at the county level. Compared to last year, this first step of work can be said to have been universally achieved. The second step is to unify them under the administrative inspectorate district. The teams of each county in the district should be unified by the district security commander or the chief of the security branch. All management, personnel, education, organization, and deployment should be completely centralized in the inspectorate district. According to the current situation in various provinces, some counties that have been raided by bandits urgently need teams for defense and suppression, but the local area is dilapidated and unable to bear the expenses of the teams. Some counties have not been raided by bandits or have been raided less severely, and although they have the ability to provide for the teams, they do not need to organize teams. Each is divided and separated, completely losing the function of adjusting surpluses and deficits, and unable to use the surplus of one to compensate for the deficiency of the other. The situation is constrained, and the bandit problem will never be quelled. Therefore, the unification of teams in each county under the district is based on the requirements of the facts and is absolutely necessary. After unifying under the district, the third step is to further unify under the province. Everything is centrally managed by the province and used by the districts for defense. The situations in various provinces are not uniform, and the steps may be slow or fast. However, by this time next year, even if we cannot uniformly achieve the third step of provincial unification, at the very least, the second step of district unification must be completed uniformly. This is what we must strive for together. In addition to these three steps, we must go further and reach the fourth step of work for the security work to reach the ideal requirements. That is to say, all security teams should be managed by the state and used by the local areas. Each province should designate a number of regimental districts, draw able-bodied men from the districts, and train a security regiment in each district every year. After training, it should be handed over to the district to replace its original security regiment and be stationed in that district. When the second phase of the security regiment is trained in the second year, the first phase of the security regiment assigned to the district should be retired to the reserve. By training and retiring in turn, we can establish the foundation of the conscription system. Currently, most provinces are in the process of progressing from the first step to the second step. We hope that all provinces can achieve the third step next year. Hunan's teams have already been unified under the province and can be said to have completed the third step of work. All provinces that have completed the third step must earnestly move forward to the fourth step. If we do not move forward to the fourth step and are satisfied with the unification of teams under the province, we will fundamentally lose the meaning of training security teams. The result will become provincial defense forces. There are already many troops in China, so why train provincial defense forces again? If you find that the military strength of your province is not enough to maintain local security, you might as well expand a division or two, or ten or eight regiments. Why set up the name of security teams separately? When we organize and train security teams, we must recognize the meaning of security teams, focusing on training and retiring in turn, which is fundamentally different from the current recruitment system of the army. We want to transition from a small-scale "draft system" to a large-scale "conscription system" as the foundation for reforming the army. Since you bear this mission, it can be seen that the responsibilities of you security chiefs are very important. Therefore, no matter which province has completed the first step, it must move forward to the second step; those who have completed the second step must move forward to the third step; and those who have completed the third step must move forward to the fourth step. Strive tirelessly until the fourth step is fully achieved, and the fundamental meaning of security work can be fully realized. The steps mentioned above have been carefully considered by the Chairman. Recently, the headquarters will definitely formulate detailed regulations and promulgate them for implementation as soon as possible. We earnestly hope that the authorities in various provinces will move forward together and achieve results according to schedule.</p>
<p>Third, the issue of training. From everyone's reports yesterday, regarding the training of team cadres, the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have cadre training classes. Hunan is incorporated into the training regiment of the West Route Army, or sent to the special class of the Central Military Academy for training. The four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi have established cadre training institutes or training battalions. In addition, the training regiment of the West Route Army has a sergeant team training class for platoon leaders. Each administrative inspectorate district in Hubei and each security branch in Zhejiang have established platoon leader training institutes or training classes. From this, it can be seen that training institutions for team cadres in various provinces have been established. Some are jointly run by two or three provinces, and some are run by each province separately. However, the ultimate goal of training security teams is to realize the fourth step of work, managed by the state and used by the local areas, as the foundation for implementing the conscription system. Therefore, not only should the training of field-grade officers and company-grade officers be absolutely unified, but also the training of soldiers should have a unified method. This issue is too big and the content is too complex. It should be determined after the Chairman's detailed consideration. In short, the education of team officers and soldiers, in terms of the content of the subjects, the depth of the level, and the presentation of the spirit, should not be slightly different. If each acts on its own and forms its own style, it will not be possible to reach the fourth step, and it will be somewhat inconsistent with the purpose of establishing security teams. In everyone's suggestions, there are twenty-seven items on organization and eight items on training. Most of them can be adopted. After you go back, if you have any better ideas, you can send them in writing within two weeks. They will be adopted as much as possible when formulating the entire plan. Currently, there are two provinces that have very good methods of using security teams as the basis for training able-bodied men in turn. Zhejiang's training team trains 60,000 able-bodied men every year, divided into two phases, each lasting three months, held during the slack season of farming. Chairman Zhang of Hubei recently had a plan to divide the security regiment into three parts, retire them, and implement rotational training, which can also train more than 26,000 able-bodied men every year. The plans of these two provinces are very practical. The Chairman instructed us yesterday that training teams is not enough just to have them shout "one, two, three, fire," and march a few steps. Because the biggest crisis in China is that most people are illiterate, lack common sense, cannot fulfill their responsibilities as Chinese citizens, and do not know the principles of being human. If we want to learn from foreign countries and slowly carry out universal education work, it will really be too late. Because compulsory education and primary school education can only cultivate citizens of ten years later, the masters of the country within twenty years are today's able-bodied men. Most of today's able-bodied men still know nothing about the rules of daily life and national common sense. How can such citizens, standing side by side with the countries of the 20th century, deal with them? Isn't that really a joke? Now, it is certainly difficult to militarize all the citizens of the country at once, but starting with the able-bodied men, incorporating the able-bodied men of each province into the security teams in turn, and starting with the training of security teams, is the most practical and effective step. In a few years, the able-bodied men of each province will have received the necessary military education and also a considerable amount of national education. Not only can the conscription system be expected to be implemented, but it is also the fastest and most convenient method of remedial education for citizens. Our slogan is "placing generals in schools," "placing soldiers in regiments," and "placing education in the military." In other words, our team's training is running schools. Everyone must clearly recognize this. The Chairman instructed us yesterday on the methods of training teams: (1) Teach them the principles of being human, that is, to implement the New Life Movement Outline and the New Life Guidelines; (2) Teach them the principles of being Chinese, that is, to have a national concept and national spirit, not to be traitors, but to be patriots and martyrs; (3) Teach them the common sense of police and military police. Regarding the third point, the meaning is very significant. I want to elaborate on it in particular, please pay special attention. In modern countries, the army is used for national defense, and the responsibility of maintaining local security is entirely the responsibility of the military police. If you want to rely on the army to maintain local security, it is to ask them to replace the work of the police and military police. In such a situation, the military discipline of the army will definitely be difficult to maintain. However, under the current situation in China, manpower and financial resources are very lacking. If all localities want to establish large-scale police and military police to maintain local security and order, it cannot be done. In the future, we will rely on the baojia system to do rural policing, and rely on the security teams to do rural military police. The baojia and security teams are both natives, familiar with the local situation, and have close interests. As long as they are given appropriate training, they will definitely be more effective and more responsible than the recruited police and military police. On the other hand, each province is now using the army and security teams to suppress bandits, and using the baojia system to clear bandits. Soon, the bandit suppression work will be completed. Does that mean that the security teams can be disbanded and the baojia system can be abolished after the bandits are eliminated? Therefore, in the future, training teams should pay special attention to the common sense of military police, the significance of which is to ensure that the teams can effectively assume the tasks of military police after the bandit suppression. This is the proper function of the security team, to be the local police and military police in peacetime, and the national conscription in wartime. The fundamental meaning lies here. Everyone must clearly recognize this.</p>
<p>Fourth, the issue of funding. According to everyone's reports, the funding for teams in each province is approximately 300,000 yuan per month in Anhui, approximately 360,000 yuan per month in Fujian, approximately 400,000 yuan per month in Hubei, approximately 450,000 yuan per month in Jiangxi, approximately 460,000 yuan per month in Hunan, approximately 480,000 yuan per month in Jiangsu, and approximately 510,000 yuan per month in Zhejiang. Combining the figures reported by each province, the monthly funding for teams in each province is at most more than 500,000 yuan and at least more than 300,000 yuan. It can be seen that each province has paid a large sum of money for security teams. If there are no corresponding results and no corresponding effects, then it is really unfair to the public. However, funding is the foundation of all undertakings. To ask things to be done well and the work to be done well, organizing funding is naturally the first priority. As far as I know, Director Fan of Hubei told me the year before last that the expenses for teams in each county of Hubei Province, which were freely raised and freely organized, were roughly estimated to be more than 15 million yuan per year, which was more than double the fixed income of the provincial treasury. If a precise investigation is conducted, including the embezzlement of funds by personnel involved in the collection, it may be even more than this number. Hubei is like this, and the situation in other provinces is probably similar to what Director Fan said. The darkness of the defense regiments in the past was really too messy. Since the Three Provinces Headquarters promulgated the regulations on reorganizing county local finances the year before last, each county must set up a finance committee, and all finances are collected and spent by the county in a unified manner. The malpractice mentioned above has slowly been corrected, and the source of funds has gradually been determined. Although I dare not say that everything has been done well uniformly, the methods of revenue and expenditure are gradually improving. According to the recent report from Hubei Province, the reliable team funding income for the whole year, after the reorganization by the Provincial Team Funding Reorganization Committee, has been greatly reduced and is estimated to be more than 4.6 million yuan, which is more than two-thirds less than the burden on the public in the past. Therefore, the reorganization of security funding should also go through three steps: first, unification at the county level; second, unification at the administrative inspectorate district level; and third, unification at the provincial level. It is still not possible to just unify the funding at the county level. Because, compared to each county in the province, the fertility of the land is different, the abundance of products is different, the wealth of the people is different, the amount of tax revenue is different, and the severity of the bandit situation is also different. If the county is used as a unit, the poorest counties are mostly remote areas, the bandit situation must be the most severe, and the need for teams is the most urgent, and it is particularly difficult to raise funds. At least, the administrative inspectorate district should be used to coordinate and take care of the overall situation, so that the allocation and use of teams can be appropriate and the labor and leisure of officers and soldiers can be balanced. Regarding this point, there are twelve suggestions from everyone, which can all be used for reference. The headquarters must formulate a practical plan recently and issue it to all provinces for compliance. Even if various provinces cannot be absolutely consistent immediately due to special circumstances, this general principle, first unifying at the county level, then unifying at the district level, and then unifying at the provincial level, is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>Fifth, the situation of bandit suppression work. After listening to everyone's reports, Jiangsu currently only has a slightly bandit problem in Lianshui and Shuyang counties in northern Jiangsu. The interior of Zhejiang is peaceful, but there are still pirates and communist bandits invading the coastal areas and the border areas of Jiangxi and Fujian provinces from time to time. Henan was originally the province with the most bandit gangs in the past, but now the large gangs of bandits have gradually been wiped out. Anhui has also repeatedly eliminated large gangs of bandits. Currently, only Lihuang, Huoshan, Zhizhi and other counties near the border areas of the three provinces still have bandit disturbances. The teams in Hunan not only have the power to maintain security within the province, but also a part of them can go with the West Route Army to suppress bandits outside the province. Currently, there is only a small gang of bandits in the border area of Hunan and Guangdong provinces, which is also being effectively pursued and suppressed. The interior of Hubei is very quiet, but there are still scattered bandits in the border areas of eastern Hubei, southern Hubei, and northern Hubei counties. The teams in Jiangxi have participated in bandit suppression a total of more than 200 times in the past year, especially the battle of Zuofang in Jinxi, which was the most successful. In the past year, the bandit suppression power of the teams in various provinces has indeed been much stronger than before, but the ability to fight independently may still be a bit lacking. This is also a recognized fact. As far as the eight provinces attending this meeting are concerned, the officers, soldiers, and firearms of the teams in each province are more than 20,000 to 30,000, and the able-bodied teams in each province have also reported about 2 million. If, according to the method mentioned above, these 20,000 to 30,000 teams are used as the foundation, and the training they have received is extended and popularized to 2 million able-bodied men, and they are united and used as a whole, this achievement will definitely be very impressive. On a smaller scale, if 16 to 17 million able-bodied men in these eight provinces can understand the principles of being human, receive remedial education in national affairs, and have the common sense of police and military police, they can become the backbone of society and the key to all local construction. How can we worry that China will not be rich and strong? In the shortest period of time, even if all the citizens of the country cannot be militarized, these 16 to 17 million able-bodied men, having received rigorous training, can become the model of good citizens and the foundation of good soldiers. This is what I hope everyone will work hard for in particular.</p>
<p>The above is a general conclusion regarding everyone's work reports, and also a rough description of the general direction for improving the security work in the future. In addition, regarding everyone's individual suggestions, such as Fujian's proposal to reorganize and incorporate local militias, Henan's proposal to reduce the size of security teams, Zhejiang and Anhui's proposal to replenish ammunition and replace firearms, Anhui's proposal to request that the uniforms of the teams be consistent with the national army, and Henan's proposal that teams dispatched to suppress bandits outside the province should be given pensions according to the national army regulations, these are all relatively easy to solve. After the competent authorities review and approve them, they can be answered separately. I hope that in the year between the second meeting and the third meeting, everyone will work hard in particular and fully achieve the Chairman's hopes for everyone."</p>
<h3>Completion of All Anhui Highways; Construction Director Liu Yiyan on Inspection Tour</h3>
<p>Yanhu Telegram. The Seven Provinces Highway Conference will be held in Beijing on the 26th of this month. Liu Yiyan, Director of the Construction Department of Anhui Province, took a riverboat from Anqing to Wuhu this morning to inspect the expansion of roads in Wuhu and the newly built Zheshan Park. At 1:00 p.m., he changed to a car and went to Beijing via the Jingwu Road. Since the Five Provinces Transportation Exposition is approaching, after the conference, he will inspect the highway projects in southern Anhui via the Jingjian Road. In recent years, the construction of highways in this province has made rapid progress, and no less than dozens of them have been completed one after another. In southern Anhui, highways such as Jingwu, Xuanzhang, Jingjian, and Huihang have been paved with gravel surfaces, reaching several hundred miles. As for Anhubei, central Anhui, and western Anhui, the roadbeds of Anhe (Anqing-Hefei), Hechao (Chaoxian-Hefei), Hebang (Hefei-Bengbu), Helu (Hefei-Luan), Shuhe (Shucheng-Huoqiu), Liuzheng (Luan-Zhengyang), and Shouzhen (Shouxian-Zhengyang) have also been completed earlier, and most of them are open to traffic, handling passenger and freight transportation. However, because there are very few stone mountains in northern Anhui, the transportation of road surface materials is very difficult, so most of them have not been paved. Whenever it rains, driving becomes an obstacle, and the limited funds are also the biggest reason. Because the construction of highways in this province, all trunk lines stipulated by the National Economic Commission, except for the roadbed expenses borne by the local government, the commission can lend 40% of the funds for road surfaces, bridges, and culverts. However, because the province's 60% fund is not fixed, borrowing is also very difficult. Although Chairman Chiang has promised to provide subsidies, there is no predetermined amount, so it has not been possible to plan comprehensively. In southern Anhui, with the Yantun Road as the center, all three roads from Yantunxi to Xuanzhou, from Yantunxi to Hangzhou, and from Yantunxi to Chun'an have been completed. Xuanzhou is divided into two lines, one through Langxi to Nanjing, and one through Guangde to Changxing. Gaiwutun Road is the longest and largest project in the southern Anhui road line. In terms of the Wuhu to Wanxin section alone, the cost has reached 250,000 yuan. The entire line is expected to be completed by the end of August and is currently being rushed day and night in order to complete it in time for the Five Provinces Transportation Exposition.

<h3>Liu Duoquan's Division Heavily Defeats Remnant Bandits in Border Areas; Chiang and Zhang Dispatch Personnel to Comfort Bandit Suppression Troops; Zhang Arrives in Southern Henan and Immediately Transfers to Inspect Western Anhui</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The remnant bandits in the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui border areas have been repeatedly and severely suppressed. The current number of them is around two to three thousand. The National Army's advancing suppression troops greatly outnumber the bandit troops. The outcome of victory or defeat is already a foregone conclusion. However, the National Army must establish defenses step by step, while the bandits scatter and flee in disarray. Therefore, complete pacification has not yet been achieved. In the middle of this month, the bandits fled to the eastern Hubei territory and were surrounded by various armies. The majority of them were in the mountains of Hujiahe and Lijia Kou, while a smaller portion was in Sanlangdian and Yangpingkou, attempting to break through and flee north again. The National Army in that area consisted of the entire 8th Brigade and part of the 10th Brigade of the 105th Division under Liu Duoquan, all of which were elite troops. On the night of the 21st, they attacked Yangpingkou and engaged the bandits, initiating a fierce battle. The remnant bandits in the Hujiahe, Lijia Kou, and Erlangdian areas combined forces and launched a fierce attack on the division in dense formations. After being repelled by machine guns, they split into four columns and charged in close combat, failing three times. From the 21st to the 23rd, there were intense battles. When He and Liu's armies heard the report, they launched a coordinated attack, and the bandits were unable to withstand it and collapsed, suffering heavy casualties. Liu's division bore the brunt of the attack and captured a large number of prisoners. The seriously wounded officers and soldiers of the division were sent to Hankou for treatment on the 24th. Liu remained in the front lines, joining forces with other armies to pursue and suppress the bandits. Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang had previously departed for eastern Hubei, made proper arrangements in Huangma and other places, and proceeded to inspect the Huangzhou and Shangcheng areas in southern Henan. Within days, he will transfer to the Liuan and Lihuang counties in western Anhui, inspecting the bandit suppression troops along the way, providing instructions, and offering encouragement. He particularly emphasized admonitions to the Northeast Army. Zhang also separately rewarded those who had made meritorious contributions in suppressing the bandits. Furthermore, he dispatched senior adjutant Sun Zhaoyin and staff officer Xia Yongpei from the headquarters as representatives to offer condolences. They also joined Generalissimo Chiang in issuing a letter of condolence to the officers and soldiers, which read: "Recently, we received reports from front-line generals that the Red bandits, after this series of severe suppressions, have reached the point of fleeing in disarray and collapsing on their own. This outcome is indeed the result of the officers and soldiers' perseverance, sincere cooperation, loyalty, and courageous fighting. The officers and soldiers know only the nation and not themselves, know only their duties and not hardships. Therefore, they sacrifice everything to fight the Red bandits, achieving remarkable results, which also resulted in many casualties. The Generalissimo and Deputy Commander are deeply concerned and saddened. However, due to the nature of our duties, we cannot personally comfort each and every one of you, which we deeply regret. We have specially dispatched senior adjutant Sun Zhaoyin and staff officer Xia Yongpei to the front lines to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the officers and soldiers' hardships of eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, and broken bones, to offer our sincere condolences. We also hope that everyone will continue their efforts to completely eliminate the remnant bandits, so that the nation can embark on the path of construction and brightness. This is of utmost importance." (24th)</p>
<h3>Martyr Division Commander Li Ming Reburied in Zhongshan Mountain; Coffin Transported from Jiangxi to Beijing</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: When the fourth encirclement and suppression of the Communist bandits began in January of last year, the 52nd and 59th Divisions were advancing horizontally from Yongfeng via Lean towards Yihuang. Just as they were concentrating, Zhu De and Mao Zedong suddenly ambushed them with approximately 30,000 to 40,000 men from the pseudo 135th Army Corps and the pseudo 12th Army at the border of Yile. When the two divisions arrived, they were heavily surrounded. Li Ming, the commander of the 52nd Division, fought bravely and died in Jiaohu. Chen Shiji, the commander of the 59th Division, also disappeared at the same time. This is a heroic and tragic page in the battle to suppress the Red bandits. It can also be compared with the battles of Zhang Huizan at Longgang and Hu Zuyu at Guangchang. Later, friendly forces discovered Li's remains and transported them to Nanchang, temporarily placing them in the Guangdong Guild Hall in Nanchang. Upon being presented by Chairman Chiang, the central government provided substantial compensation. Starting on the 21st of this month, a public memorial service was held for three days. Chairman Lin of the Central Party Headquarters, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang, comrades-in-arms, and various sectors of the province all sent elegiac couplets and eulogies. Those who paid their respects during these three days were endless. The funeral procession departed at 8:00 AM on the 24th, passing from the Guangdong Guild Hall through Jima Chun, Zhongshan Road, and Deshengmen to reach Yanjiang Road. The ceremonial guards stretched for several miles. Most striking was the Blood Clothing Pavilion where Li died, still stained with blood. No fewer than 10,000 people attended the funeral. At 11:00 AM, the coffin arrived at Yanjiang Road. Chiang, being in Beijing, sent Xiong Shihui as a representative to pay respects. After the ceremony, the coffin was transported across the river by a special train on the Nanxun Road to Xunyang. Li's wife, sons, and daughter, as well as Luo Zhuoying, the Deputy Commander of the Third Route Army, accompanied and escorted the coffin. When they arrived in Xunyang, Chen Cheng, as a longtime comrade-in-arms who had gone through hardships together, will descend from Mount Lu to pay his respects. Then, the remains will be transported to Beijing and buried on Zijin Mountain to comfort the loyal soul. (24th)</p>
<h3>Weihai Salt Smuggling Tide; Caused by Villagers Seeking to Evade Salt Tax; Over 30,000 Dan of Salt Looted in One Night</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The coastal areas of eastern Shandong have always been abundant in fishing and salt resources. Recently, the tide of salt smuggling has been extremely rampant. As one wave subsides, another rises. Two weeks ago, a salt smuggling tide occurred in Weihaiwei, with over 4,000 to 5,000 dan of salt looted. Unexpectedly, on the 16th of this month, hundreds of villagers from Ludao Kou and other places in Weihai launched a large-scale salt looting spree. After three days of continuous looting, the number increased to several thousand. From the 16th to the 18th, a total of over 30,000 dan of salt were looted. Ships and hemp bags were prepared in advance, suggesting a planned operation. Xu Dongfan, the administrative commissioner of Weihai, initially advocated peaceful persuasion, which had little effect. Fortunately, with the assistance of the Marine Corps, the public was persuaded that anyone who dared to loot again would be arrested. The public then dispersed. As for the reason for the salt looting, it is said that salt yards in Weihai used to pay salt taxes to the British flag of the county. After China took it back, the initial tax was 6 jiao per dan, which gradually increased to 2 yuan and 6 jiao. The ignorant villagers then engaged in salt looting. Li Zhifan, the Shandong salt transport commissioner, went to Weihai for inspection a few days ago and returned to Jinan last night (22nd). Today (23rd), while welcoming Kong Xiangxi at the railway station, he personally reported the details to Han Fuju and discussed relief measures. According to Li Zhifan, a salt looting incident had previously occurred in Weihai. This is the second time. Several thousand villagers gathered at the Ludao Kou salt yards and freely took away the salt. The salt yards had a total stockpile of 90,000 dan, and 30,000 dan were looted in one night. Fortunately, Zhang Chucai, the captain of the Third Platoon of the Marine Corps stationed there, led his troops to maintain order, and the villagers retreated. Otherwise, they would not have stopped until all the salt was looted. Commissioner Xu Dongfan specifically convened a meeting of village elders for this purpose, regrettably failing to maintain order earlier. After the people looted the salt, they paid the salt price according to the amount taken, but they did not pay a single penny of the 2 yuan and 6 jiao salt tax per dan. The purpose of their salt looting was undoubtedly to save on the salt tax. However, the salt tax is a national revenue, and this trend cannot be allowed to continue. Currently, one side is investigating the ringleaders, while the other side is pursuing the 78,000 yuan in salt tax for the 30,000 dan lost, to prevent the recurrence of future disturbances. While in Weihai, I heard rumors of salt looting brewing in Yexian County and the Xiaying area of Changyi. I specifically went to investigate and found that the local areas were as calm as ever, with no abnormalities. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Department of Finance Convenes Meeting of Agricultural Warehouses in Various Counties; Resolves to Actively Promote Agricultural Warehouses</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: The Jiangsu Department of Finance convened a meeting of agricultural warehouses in 29 counties at the Provincial Farmers Bank on the 25th. In the morning, representatives from various counties reported in, totaling over 30 people. Only Taixian and Huaiyin were unable to attend due to unforeseen circumstances. At 2:00 PM, the first general meeting was held, resolving three major cases. Group discussions were held on the 26th, and the meeting adjourned immediately after completion, with no further general meetings. The details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After performing the ceremonial procedures, Chairman Zhao, the Director of Finance, reported on the Jiangsu rural relief plan, stating that before 1930, the Jiangsu countryside did not experience floods or droughts, and the financial situation was still adequate. However, after 1930, an unprecedented major flood occurred, followed by the impact of the January 28th Incident. The rural economy gradually declined. In recent years, although there have been bumper harvests year after year, the lack of cash has led to weak purchasing power and unsalable grain, creating the phenomenon of cheap grain hurting farmers. In view of this, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has established a Rural Finance Relief Committee to plan and establish agricultural warehouses in various counties to handle storage and pledging. This is a key measure to circulate rural finance. If storage and pledging are managed effectively, farmers' supply will decrease, and market prices can be increased. Storage and pledging are the main focus, with purchasing as a supplement. The progress made last year was limited due to the short time, and not much purchasing was done. However, farmers already felt it was very convenient. This year, it is planned to establish warehouses on a large scale in order to provide relief to the countryside. Subsequently, representatives from various counties successively reported on (1) the equipment and construction of warehouses, (2) the production and sales of agricultural products in various counties. After the reports were completed, discussions began.</p>
<p>Discussion Proposals: (1) How should the storage and pledging method be determined? Resolved: The storage and pledging method will be divided into two types: self-management by the County Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee and management entrusted to banks. A. In counties where banks have already been established, the County Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee will directly contact the banks. B. In counties where banks have not been established, the County Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee will conduct a nearby investigation to determine the names and quantities of products, and estimate the required funds, and then contact nearby banks. (2) How should processing equipment be funded? Resolved: If the local situation requires processing equipment, it may be funded. The so-called local situation has three meanings: A. Agricultural products that cannot be stored and stored without processing equipment. B. Those related to transportation and sales. C. Farmers in the area feel that the processing equipment of the warehouse is convenient. (3) How should agricultural product transportation and sales be planned? Resolved: Agricultural warehouses in various counties should vigorously promote cooperative transportation and sales of agricultural products.

<h3>Public Security Bureau's Workers' Penal Responsibility Dispute</h3>
<p>Tang Xinghai, the factory owner and manager of Qingfeng Yarn Factory on Guangqin Road, had a dispute with worker Lu Fengqing while inspecting the netting department of the factory on the 26th of last month. Tang slapped Lu's face three times and fired him. Lu endured the humiliation and returned home unemployed. On the evening of the 23rd of this month, Lu encountered Tang Xinghai passing by the intersection of Guangqin Road and Jingqing Road in a chartered car. He immediately stepped forward and angrily struck Tang Xinghai twice, knocking off his glasses. After being humiliated, Tang called the police on duty. Lu, without waiting for the police to arrest him, instead dragged Tang to the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. That night, the Branch Chief of the Sixth Branch presented Lu Fengqing to the General Bureau. After Chief Chen, along with Inspector Wang, Section Chief Yi, and staff member Jin, held a court hearing and interrogated Lu Fengqing overnight, they sentenced Lu to 30 days of detention and ordered the police to flog his palms 50 times. This caused Lu's right palm to become bruised, swollen, and elevated by about an inch. After the flogging, he was ordered to be imprisoned and not allowed to meet with outside visitors. However, workers in the Zhou Shanbang and outside the West Gate areas have heard about Lu Fengqing's penal responsibility situation at the Public Security Bureau and expressed their indignation. They immediately sent representatives to the County Party Headquarters to request assistance. Upon receiving the report, the County Party Headquarters sent Standing Committee Member Gui Wochen and Supervisory Committee Member Jiang Boshen to the Public Security Bureau to ask Chief Chen to bring out Lu Fengqing. After Gui and Jiang interrogated him about the situation, they still returned him to custody. Gui and Jiang then went to the County Government and reported the situation to County Magistrate Yan. Upon hearing the report, Yan was furious and immediately telegraphed Chief Chen, ordering him to investigate the details of the situation and report them. At the same time, County Magistrate Yan also planned to personally go to the Public Security Bureau to examine Lu Fengqing's injuries and thoroughly investigate the matter. However, it is heard that Lu's family has filed a petition requesting the local branch court to quickly dispose of the case, bring Lu Fengqing to the court to examine his injuries, and handle it according to the law.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Batavia, Java Promote Domestic Products: Letter Sent to the International Trade Bureau Requesting Introduction; Manufacturers Can Contact the Guidance Office</h3>
<p>The Guidance Office of the International Trade Bureau stated that the recent economic downturn has become a common phenomenon in various countries around the world. Chinese goods, whether at home or abroad, have suffered greatly. In order to develop foreign trade and rescue domestic merchants, the bureau is making every effort to promote and introduce Chinese products for export. Nanyang (Southeast Asia) is the only overseas market for our country's raw materials and manufactured goods, with a considerable amount exported each year. Now, the Tong Lee Company, founded by overseas Chinese in Batavia, Java, used to purchase goods from European and American countries. However, in order to promote domestic goods, they plan to purchase domestic rosin, menthol, toothpaste, red alum, color powder, cosmetics, as well as glass vials for medicines, lead caps for sealing bottles, empty kerosene cans, etc. Manufacturers who wish to promote their products abroad are requested to promptly notify the Guidance Office so that it can inform the company for procurement.</p>
<h3>Amidst Announcements of the Ping-Shen Railway Opening, the Flour Market Improves: Market Prices Increase Significantly to Over 20 Cents; New Wheat Harvests are Shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin and Beijing</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the domestic grain market has been in a slump. The price of flour has gradually fallen from over three yuan to less than two yuan. Flour mills in this city have also successively stopped production, barely managing to maintain operations. However, in the past few days, there has been a sudden change from the sluggish state of the past, and a sudden surge in activity. The average price of flour has increased by about 20-30 cents per bag, from less than two yuan to two yuan, twenty or thirty cents. The reason is that the Ping-Shen railway is about to open, and large quantities of flour are being sold to the Northeast. In addition, due to the recent hot and dry weather, it is feared that this year's harvest will not be abundant, so market prices have become strong. There have been many transactions in the flour market in recent days, which is a good sign for the flour industry. A reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency made special inquiries yesterday to the flour industry in this city about the recent active state of the flour market, which is recorded below.</p>
<h3>There are Three Reasons for the Improvement in Flour: The Reasons for the Sudden Improvement in the Flour Industry Amidst the Economic Downturn</h3>
<p>There are really three points: (1) The flour market has always been monopolized by American and Canadian wheat. However, this year, due to droughts in the United States and other places, it no longer encroaches on the Chinese market, and domestic flour has begun to improve. (2) Although domestic flour is currently facing the season when new wheat is harvested, and flour prices usually plummet, the recent weather has been extremely hot, and there has been drought in various places without rain, making it impossible to plant seeds. It is expected that this year will be a year of poor harvest, and the supply will not meet the demand, so the market price of flour has become tight and has gradually risen. (3) The Ping-Shen railway will be put into operation on July 1st. Our country's flour has always been mostly sold to the three northeastern provinces. After the September 18th Incident, this huge market was cut off, and flour production became surplus. After the railway is opened, the past sales channels will be restored, so there is a sudden surge in activity.</p>
<h3>Inland Flour Will All Be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to news from the flour market in this city, in recent days, the market price of flour has increased from over one yuan and ninety cents to two yuan, twenty or thirty cents per bag, a significant increase compared to before. Flour businesses are all pleased with this, as it is a good sign not seen this year. There are many buyers, and although the new wheat has recently been harvested, what is being shipped to Shanghai is mostly soybeans, and there is very little flour, so there is a general shortage of supply. Currently, inland flour is all being shipped to Shanghai to await a good price.</p>
<h3>Sales in North China are Very Active</h3>
<p>In North China, flour was previously mostly supplied by the Japanese. Recently, after efforts to compete by domestic flour merchants, and because market prices are strong and transportation costs are quite reasonable, the amount of flour from Shanghai to Tianjin and Beijing is not small, and sales in North China have suddenly become active.</p>
<h3>Glimmer of Hope for Rent Reduction: The Central Government is Well Aware of the Suffering of Shanghai Residents</h3>
<p>The National News Agency reports that the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, taking advantage of Mr. Jin Chu Xiang's trip to Beijing, specially prepared a petition to the Executive Yuan requesting the implementation of rent reduction. The committee received a telegram yesterday from Mr. Jin stating, "This morning, I petitioned the Executive Yuan. Secretary Zhai received me and said that the central government is well aware of the suffering of Shanghai residents from high housing prices, and an order will be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government for handling within days."</p>
<h3>Dedication Ceremony of the Monument to Martyred Police Officers Held Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Wen Hongen reported, roughly saying, "Today is the unveiling ceremony of the monument to police officers who died in the line of duty over the years. It is an honor to have representatives from all walks of life come to participate. As for the motivation for building this monument, since the founding of the country after the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, Shanghai has been close to the capital and is the largest commercial port in the country. Shanghai's public security police officers have worked diligently and selflessly. During the tense situation of the Shanghai War, they all relied on the entire force of officers and police to fulfill their duties and protect the local area. Some became ill and died on duty, and some sacrificed their lives to defend the local area. In order to commemorate the great achievements of these police officers, in addition to building a public cemetery in Jiangwan, a special request was made to the municipal government to establish this monument on a piece of land opened up between Baoshan Road and Hongxing Road. The monument was designed by engineer Fan Wenzhao, and Chen Bingqian generously donated the land. Construction began in August last year, and it has taken almost a year to complete. A total of more than 40,000 yuan was spent. In addition to 10,000 yuan raised by the Public Security Bureau, the remaining 30,000 yuan was donated by all walks of life. We are truly grateful."</p>

<h3>Mayor's Address</h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, Mayor Wu delivered an address, saying, "Today we are holding the unveiling ceremony of the Shanghai Police Officers Memorial who died in the line of duty. In such a solemn and enthusiastic atmosphere, we should deeply implement and recognize the following three important meanings. First, everyone should strive to fulfill their current duties. Second, everyone should earnestly emulate the police officers who died in the line of duty in the past. Third, everyone should promote the inherent national spirit of 'benevolence and righteousness.' In previous speeches to the military and police comrades in this city, there has always been a consistent central idea in each speech. The main point of this idea is to encourage everyone to be loyal to their duties. Being loyal to one's duties, from the perspective of the average person, is not only the most correct attitude to life, but also the only principle for success in a lifelong career. From the perspective of us civil servants, it should especially be regarded as the highest principle of service ethics, because whether administrative efficiency can be increased and whether the welfare of the people can be improved all depend on whether civil servants can be loyal to their duties. I have repeatedly spoken about this meaning with the military and police in this city, and I will not repeat it today. The most obvious and important meaning of why we are building this monument today to commemorate the police officers of this city who died in the line of duty over the years is, on the one hand, to commemorate their spirit of being loyal to their duties, and on the other hand, especially to encourage the police officers who died in the line of duty to never forget the spirit of loyalty, enthusiasm, and selfless sacrifice of the past under the profound influence of this monument. Not only should they not forget, but they should also be able to inherit and promote this great spirit. From now on, it is hoped that the police officers in this city will all be able to be loyal to their own duties, not to avoid danger when facing difficulties, not to stay away from danger when seeing it, but to put their duties in front of their own lives, and to value their duties more than their own lives. Nowadays, most of the people are dominated by a cowardly, selfish, comfort-seeking, decadent, and weak individualism. Therefore, everyone only sees their own interests and their own comfort, and forgets the interests of the entire society, and even harms the survival of the entire nation for their own selfish interests. The great sages and worthies of our past all taught the people to sacrifice the 'small self' and maintain the survival of the 'big self' with the spirit of 'benevolence and righteousness.' As Confucius said, 'Sacrifice one's life to achieve benevolence.' Mencius said, 'Life is what I desire, and righteousness is what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will give up life for righteousness.' However, the spirit of 'benevolence and righteousness' inherent in our nation has been completely abandoned. Therefore, everywhere we only see the development of the small self and the expansion of selfish interests, and the 'survival power' of our nation is declining day by day. If we want to trace the root cause of today's national crisis, we cannot but attribute it to the degeneration of this national spirit. Therefore, today's monument to commemorate the police officers who died in the line of duty, on the other hand, has a profound and great meaning, especially in promoting the spirit of benevolence and righteousness inherent in our nation to sacrifice the small self and maintain the big self. Therefore, this mere monument, although not very majestic in form, in terms of its spiritual influence, may not be considered the foundation for transforming the national psychology and inspiring the national spirit. Today, I would like to take advantage of the opportunity of holding the unveiling ceremony to briefly and sincerely explain to you the meaning of why we are building this monument. I hope that you will not only be able to recognize and commemorate it, but also be able to earnestly reflect on it and strive to implement it."</p>
<h3>Monument Inscription</h3>
<p>The inscription on the Monument to Shanghai Police Officers Who Died in the Line of Duty reads: "Shanghai has long been the heart of the Southeast region. Its land is where rivers and seas meet, and its people are a mix of Chinese and foreigners. The city's shops are lined up, and the streets and alleys are connected. Therefore, the security of the residential areas and the investigation of criminals depend on police affairs. Is its relationship not of utmost importance? After the establishment of the municipal government, the Public Security Bureau was set up to take charge of local security. Therefore, good families from the six counties and young men from the three rivers all eagerly rushed to serve, willing to give their lives. Because of their well-organized training and decisive command, they were able to protect three million residents with five thousand police officers, and they were able to do so calmly and adequately. Tracing their ordinary and smooth lives, they obeyed the law and served the public. They received meager salaries and fulfilled the most arduous responsibilities. They slept in the open air and ate frost, and they were drenched in rain and baked by the sun. They were already overworked and exhausted. Suddenly encountering extraordinary changes, they risked their lives in danger and never wavered in the face of difficulties, like Li Jiankun and the other twenty-one people, how magnificent they were! There were also teaching officers and service personnel who either overturned their cars and shattered their heads, or were blown up by bombs and burned their bodies. Although they encountered misfortune, they were worthy of pity, but they sacrificed their lives for their duties, and they were almost ashamed. If Wang Shicong and Hong Junren, this is their choice. But what is even more difficult is that during the January 28th Incident, they assisted the national army, fought against the enemy with the same hatred, and achieved benevolence and took righteousness, such as Wang Zhongyuan and the following seven people, were not only the glory of the police, but also the model of the people. Mayor Wu and Director Wen admired their compatriots and looked up to the martyrs, thinking that those who defended the people and resisted the enemy, ate their salaries and sacrificed their affairs, and those who praised their achievements and honored their achievements, lamented that Jiu Yuan would not be written, and endured the silence of Pei Tu. Therefore, they raised money together, discussed with the public, and planned to build a police cemetery on the side of the Zhabei Jiangwan Municipal Cemetery, and then selected a piece of land between Baoshan Road and Hongxing Road to erect a monument to preserve the memory. Alas, the soul recruits Song Yu, the song of the martyrs is bleak, and the blood of the righteous people is transformed into Bi Hua Changhong. If you pass the car, you must try it, and the mother will not forget it. This is the record. Written by Liu Yazi from Wujiang, March of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, written by Wen Hongen from Wenchang."</p>

<h3>Landlords Voluntarily Reduce Rents: All Have Them in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Concession Areas</h3>
<p>Since the rent reduction movement in this city, many landlords in various places who are well aware of the general righteousness have taken the lead in initiating rent reductions. It is now learned that a large number of landlords who are unwilling to lag behind have implemented voluntary rent reductions. The details learned from the investigation are recorded below. (1) Heng Yu Feng Company, the owner of the East and West Hengxing Lane in Nanshi, has been repeatedly requested by the tenants of the two lanes this year. The landlord has agreed to reduce the rent from February to 83% and 90% of the original rent. (2) The landlords of Chang'an Lane, Sheng'an Lane, and Sanxing Lane in Nanshi have agreed to reduce the rent to 80% and 90% of the original rent. (3) He Yijing Hall, the landlord of Baode Lane on Dalin Road in Nanshi, has also agreed to reduce the rent to 80% of the original rent. However, according to the landlord's side, all house donations after the rent reduction must be borne entirely by the tenants. (4) The landlord of Minli Lane on Minli Road in Zhabei has voluntarily reduced the rent from January of this year to 60% of the original rent. (5) The monthly rent of the Central Store on Xinjiang Road in Zhabei was originally 49 yuan. Now, the landlord has agreed to deduct 3 yuan, actually collecting 46 yuan. (6) The houses in Xiang Kang Lane on Baker Road in the Public Concession are leased by She Mao Foreign Firm. The firm, in view of the requests of the tenants, which are due to the sluggish market, has now decided to voluntarily reduce the rent. It has already notified the tenants that from May of this year, the rent will be calculated at 85% of the original rent, thereby reducing the burden on the tenants. (7) Huishan Lane on East Broadway Road is owned by the British Isle-Dade Foreign Firm. After the tenants of the lane repeatedly requested a rent reduction, they received the following rent reduction notice from the manager of the foreign firm, Gan Tuo (transliteration): "We hereby declare that we have approved the reduction of the rent for the following houses from 139 yuan, 86 cents per month to 120 yuan per month (which is a reduction of 15% of the original amount) from May 1934." (8) The building along the road in Tongan Lane on Sanma Road is owned by the Pingzhi Foreign Firm. The rent of 40 yuan per room will be reduced to 35 yuan from June. (9) It is also learned that the Tongfu Kerosene Store at No. 41 Datong Road in Zhabei has also been voluntarily reduced to 70% of the original rent by the landlord. It is also heard that in various places in the Chinese Concession, there are still a large number of landlords who will voluntarily reduce rents, and they are currently in consultation.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram Requesting No Reduction in Import Tax on Foreign Sugar: Maintain Domestic Cane Sugar and Recover Lost Revenue</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministries of Finance and Industry in Nanjing yesterday, saying, "Nanjing Ministries of Finance and Industry: It is noted that after the import tariff on foreign sugar was increased in the import tariff rules promulgated in May of last year, domestic cane sugar, due to its light weight and low price, gradually had the opportunity to compete in the market. This is precisely the key to recovering lost revenue. The hope of reviving the sugarcane fields in Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi is even greater. It provides a lot of relief in today's rural bankruptcy. The motivation for reducing the tariff on foreign sugar this time is reportedly due to too much smuggling after the tariff rate was increased, and the intention is to use this as a way to ease the situation. This is putting the cart before the horse and is difficult to take as a lesson. The main purpose of the state's revision of tariffs is to protect industry and commerce and maintain industry. If tax reductions are used to attract smugglers, why not simply restore the pre-tariff era when autonomy was not achieved, and the rate was 5% of the value, which would be even more direct? Moreover, tax evasion and smuggling are not limited to sugar alone. If that is the case, it is imperative to reduce all taxes to satisfy the desires of smugglers, which is not a system that the country can afford. Now, the customs is increasing the construction of anti-smuggling ships, as reported in the news. This is the right way to maintain tax revenue. There is no reason to withdraw defenses, sacrifice domestic cane sugar, and hope that imported sugar merchants will not smuggle. Where will this kind of approach place the policy of protecting domestic products? We are specially stating the situation and requesting that the pros and cons be weighed, and that this proposal be immediately abolished. It is for the public good. Respectfully, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3>Opinions of the Shanghai Bankers' Association on the Savings Bank Law - Some Parts Have Been Adopted by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>The Savings Bank Law has now been formally passed by the Legislative Yuan. The full text consists of seventeen articles, and the content has been significantly amended compared to the draft law of twenty-two articles prepared by the Commercial Law Committee. Before this law was enacted, the Legislative Yuan sent the original draft to the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Bankers' Association to solicit opinions. The Bankers' Association appointed specialists to study the draft and proposed twenty-one points for amendment. Some of these points were incorporated into the law, while others were not. According to an investigation by the Xin Sheng News Agency, the most relevant points are as follows:</p>
<h3>Deposit Limits - The Original Draft Regarding Demand Deposits, Which Are Redeemable at Any Time</h3>
<p>Stipulated that the limit for each household should not exceed 2,000 yuan and should not allow the use of checks. The Bankers' Association proposed raising the limit to 5,000 yuan and deleting the prohibition on using checks. However, Article 5 of the current law has changed the limit for demand deposits to 5,000 yuan but still prohibits the use of checks.</p>
<h3>Rural Lending - The Original Draft Stipulated That Loans to Rural Cooperatives</h3>
<p>Should not be less than one-quarter of the total deposits. The Bankers' Association proposed merging loans secured by valuable securities, loans secured by real estate, and loans to rural cooperatives into a category that should not exceed one-quarter of the total deposits. The last item of Article 8 of the current law stipulates that the total amount of loans to rural cooperatives secured by pledges and loans secured by agricultural products should not be less than one-fifth of the total deposits.</p>
<h3>Responsibilities of Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>The original draft stipulated that</p>
<p>Shareholders of savings banks should be liable to depositors for double the amount of their subscribed shares. If this is still insufficient to repay debts, directors, supervisors, and managers should be jointly and severally liable without limit. The Bankers' Association proposed deleting the shareholders' double liability and adding a condition to the unlimited joint and several liability of directors, supervisors, and managers: "If they do not operate in accordance with the provisions of this law, resulting in insufficient assets to repay depositors' debts." The current law has eliminated the shareholders' double liability, and the unlimited joint and several liability of current directors and supervisors can be unconditionally waived.</p>
<h3>Bond Guarantees - The Original Draft Stipulated That Savings Banks Should</h3>
<p>Deposit one-third of all public bonds, treasury bills, and other valuable securities corresponding to the amount of savings deposits with the Central Bank or a bank designated by the Ministry of Finance as a guarantee for repayment. The Bankers' Association proposed changing one-third of savings deposits to one-quarter of fixed-term savings deposits and adding the public treasury of the bankers' association to the deposit institutions. However, the current law still stipulates that at least one-quarter of the total amount of savings deposits should be government bonds, treasury bills, and other assets with reliable guarantees, deposited with the Central Bank as a guarantee. Not only the public treasury of the Bankers' Association cannot be a deposit institution, but also the item of banks designated by the Ministry of Finance has been deleted.</p>
<h3>Depositor Audits</h3>
<p>The original draft stipulated, "Depositors may, when necessary, request the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to jointly inspect the accounting books of the savings bank." The Bankers' Association proposed deleting this provision. Article 11 of the current law stipulates that depositors holding more than one-twentieth of the total deposits may jointly request the Ministry of Finance or the local competent authority to send personnel to jointly inspect the bank with representatives elected by the depositors.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Savings - The Original Draft Stipulated That Ordinary Shops and Private</h3>
<p>Organizations should not accept savings deposits. The Bankers' Association proposed changing private organizations to public and private organizations. However, the current law does not have any explicit provisions regarding this.</p>
<h3>International Problems Research Association Hosted Hwatow and Ruth Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the International Problems Research Association hosted a dinner at the Bankers' Club for Sir Frederick Whyte, former advisor to the Chinese government, and Mr. Archipel Rose, Director of the British International Discussion Association. Xu Xinliu, Nie Lusheng, Zou Bingwen, Li Zhaohuan, Zhang Zhuping, Dong Xian Guang, Liu Zhanen, Guo Bingwen, Tu Chuyu, and more than ten other people attended. Both gentlemen have just come to China from Europe to investigate the situation in the Far East. The association specially hosted them to establish connections. Both gentlemen gave brief speeches during the dinner. Mr. Whyte said, in essence, that the purpose of his visit to China was to conduct on-site investigations and inquire about opinions from all parties to report back to his country. The kind hospitality of the association gave him the opportunity to inquire about the opinions of important people in the Chinese society. In addition to his personal gratitude, he deeply felt the effectiveness and need for this type of organization in the international arena.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruth said, in essence, that the association and their association have the same goals and similar work. They can certainly cooperate in the future. Their association pays close attention to China. A few years ago, someone proposed finding ways to understand the thoughts of the Chinese people, so they subscribed to all the important newspapers in China and asked a Chinese scholar to translate important editorials into English. A small booklet was published every two weeks. Initially, few people paid attention to it, but now it has a wide circulation and is highly valued by society. In addition to the general meetings held every one or two weeks, their association's categorized small group meetings are held every day, and there are even several groups meeting simultaneously every day. This is also a part of their association's work. He hopes that the association will work hard and move forward. After the two gentlemen spoke, the members raised various questions, such as Britain's attitude towards China and Japan, and British Foreign Secretary Simon's recent declaration on the Nine-Power Treaty. The two gentlemen answered in detail. The meeting adjourned at 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Publication of the Final Report on Aviation Donation Fundraising</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Aviation Patriotic Fund has raised a total of 1,394,870.911 yuan since it began in March of last year until the end of May. However, most of this amount is nominal. Since the teams have been submitting funds one after another, the actual amount paid by the end of May this year is 952,363.34 yuan. The office of the Shanghai Aviation Association Chief compiled a detailed report on the achievements of each team into a large volume called "The Final Report on the Fundraising Achievements of the Shanghai Aviation Association." Mayor Wu Tiecheng, in the name of the captain of the Shanghai Solicitation Team of the Chinese Aviation Association, sent this final report to each team captain, each agency, each organization, and major donors. It is also reported that in addition to sending it out, if any organization or agency requests it with a formal official letter, it will also be given away. The original text of this letter is recorded below: Respectfully, I, Tiecheng, took office as the captain of the Shanghai Solicitation Team of the Chinese Aviation Association in March of the reporting year. I am honored by the efforts of each team captain, the enthusiasm of each organization, the assistance of each agency, and the generous donations of all compatriots, which have resulted in remarkable achievements. I am deeply grateful for your great friendship. Now that the final report on the fundraising achievements has been compiled and published, I am enclosing a copy for your perusal as proof and for remembrance. I hope that you will remember the past and encourage the future, so that the construction of air defense will gradually become substantial and the cause of saving the country will finally achieve success.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Session of Navigator Certification Will Be Held Today - Japanese Crew Members Request to Take the Test in Japanese</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation's fourth session of navigator certification exams is scheduled to be held today at the Wusong Merchant Marine School. All Chinese and foreign crew members who have not passed the previous three certifications must take this session, which is expected to have about 400 people. As of yesterday, more than 100 people have registered. Among them, there are seven foreign crew members of Japanese nationality and seven or eight of other nationalities. It is reported that some of the Japanese crew members went to the Navigation Administration Bureau's certification registration office yesterday and requested that Japanese be added as a language for the exam, as the regulations only stipulate the use of Chinese and English. The office stated that the addition of Japanese is not explicitly stated in the regulations, and among the foreign crew members who are required to take the test, in addition to the Japanese, there are also many people of other nationalities, not just British. Therefore, the request of the Japanese crew members has been telegraphed to the Ministry of Transportation for instructions, and a reply is expected before today's certification.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association to Convene Extraordinary General Meeting as Scheduled, July 8, 2 PM</h3>

It is now rescheduled for 2 PM on July 8 at the Hu She Hall and notified all members yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that our association has convened four extraordinary general meetings of members to discuss the draft amendment to the constitution, but all have been declared adjourned due to insufficient attendance, which has had a greater impact on the progress of association affairs.

<h3>Resolution of Labor Dispute over Layoffs in the Southern Goods Industry - Most Have Returned to Work in the Stores</h3>
<p>More than 60 stores selling southern goods on Beijing Road, including Yusheng and Tangjiawan Wannian, and Shensheng on Yi'an Road, dismissed more than 120 employees without cause during the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival, causing panic among workers about unemployment. They requested assistance from the Southern Goods Industry Union. After receiving the report, the union convened a meeting to discuss how to respond, as it concerned the livelihoods of the workers, and sent a letter to the Southern Goods Trade Association to jointly mediate. It is now learned that the dispute has been resolved through negotiations with various stores over the past few days. Most have returned to work in the stores as usual. A portion of the stores, due to poor business conditions, were unable to maintain their operations, so they issued severance pay and allowed the employees to be dismissed. Therefore, the dispute has been resolved.</p>
<h3>Lin Guoguang and Others Fined for Attempted Extortion</h3>
<p>Lin Guoguang, a 30-year-old native of Yixing living in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West, was formerly a reactionary element. After being arrested by the Peace Preservation Bureau and sentenced by the court, he surrendered and became a secret agent in the Special Affairs Section of the Public Security Bureau, specializing in investigating Communist Party affairs. Recently, he learned that his wife, Ms. Luo (named Zhinan, 22 years old), had an affair with Gu Zuoyun, a native of Songjiang living at 478 Kangdi Road in the French Concession. On the 29th of last month, he and his wife, along with Lu Tinghou from Shuyang and Tan Yangjin and Chen Sanda from his hometown, booked room number 12 at the Ningfeng Hotel at 524 Minguo Road. He ordered Chen Sanda to lure Gu to the hotel. First, they accused Gu of being a Communist, then they accused Gu of having an affair with his wife. They pinned Gu down and forced him to write a promissory note for compensation. Fearing that Gu would renege, they escorted him to find a guarantor and set a deadline of three days to pay the money. Gu's freedom was only restored after a compromise was reached. Gu, feeling aggrieved by the false accusations, reported to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to arrest Lin and his associates. Several promissory notes were seized and sent to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution for attempted extortion. The details of the interrogation have been reported previously. After several hearings by Judge Xiong Huiping (two tea waiters from the Jiangsu Hotel and Jinling Apartments testified), the case was concluded. Yesterday, Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the First Criminal Court and sentenced Lin Guoguang to a fine of 100 yuan for attempting to illegally obtain the property of another by intimidation, and Lin Luo Shi and Lu Tinghou to a fine of 50 yuan each for assisting in the attempt to illegally obtain the property of another by intimidation. The fines can be commuted to imprisonment at a rate of two yuan per day. Tan Yangjin and Chen Sanda were acquitted. During the appeal period, Lin Guoguang was released on bail of 500 yuan, and the others were released on bail pending further instructions.</p>

<h3>Liu Chongwu Case Returned for Retrial - Result of Lawyer Ma Junshuo's Appeal - Such Patriotic Impulses Should Reduce Punishment</h3>
<p>The case of patriotic youth Liu Chongwu and others, who were arrested for throwing bombs to warn unscrupulous merchants, was appealed by the police for premeditated murder and sentenced to twelve years in prison by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, causing discontent among all circles in the city. An Aid Society for Patriotic People was organized, and it was decided at a meeting to hire renowned lawyers Ma Junshuo and others to file a third appeal to the Supreme Court, and Chen Jiufeng was appointed to carry out the work separately, as reported previously. A reporter from Guowen News Agency interviewed lawyer Ma Junshuo on this case, and was informed that the Supreme Court's verdict now reads: "The original verdict regarding Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, and Tian Shuiyang is revoked, and the case is returned to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for retrial." It is expected that the retrial will be held in Shanghai soon. The reporter also inquired with Lawyer Ma about his opinion on the case, and he replied that the main point of the original verdict's revocation of the first instance judgment and its imposition of a heavier sentence was that the appellants had organized a group, had an entire criminal plan, and were using murder as a means to harm the rights of others. The first instance's sentencing of Liu Chongwu for ordinary murder and Cao Songshou for injury was wrong and should be changed to premeditated murder. However, the defendants' violation of the criminal law was actually due to their enthusiasm for patriotism. Even the reasoning column of the original verdict does not deny this point. Therefore, although the defendants had organized a group, their entire plan was purely an act of patriotism and saving the country. Even according to the police's statement, the common purpose of their threats to merchants selling Japanese goods was nothing more than to implement their determination to resist Japan and save the country, and there was no intention to kill. Based on this, it can only be recognized that the defendants' purpose was to resist Japan and save the country, which is by no means comparable to premeditated murder. Moreover, the alleged premeditated murder must have concrete proof according to law, and should not be based solely on abstract circumstantial evidence. If their intention to commit murder is inferred from the organization of group meetings and other actions, the concrete facts of the premeditation are lacking and there is no concrete proof. In reality, the group meetings stopped at warning against the sale of enemy goods and there was absolutely no intention to harm the lives of others. In short, at that time, the defendants, in view of the unhealed scars of the Shanghai war and the unceasing Japanese aggression, and the fact that unscrupulous merchants were still selling Japanese goods, were motivated by righteous indignation and stood up to save the country, believing that this was an act of saving the country from imminent danger, out of necessity, and disregarding their own interests. Their criminal circumstances are particularly pitiful and forgivable. Such patriotic criminals should be especially pardoned by the state. According to the provisions of Chapter 4 on the reduction and exemption of penalties, Chapter 10 on the discretionary imposition of penalties, and Chapter 13 on suspended sentences of the Criminal Law, the penalty should be reduced, exempted, or suspended.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Sends Condolences to Unknown Technician - Taibenson's Illness Improves Suddenly - American Community in Shanghai Has Doubts</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, the 4,000-strong American community in Shanghai has never received direct condolences from the President of the United States. This time, a young man named Taibenson, who was originally an unknown technician, was being treated at the Country Hospital for acute anterior poliomyelitis he contracted two months ago. The other day he suddenly received a letter of condolence from President Roosevelt, in which he said, in essence, "I heard that you were hospitalized for acute anterior poliomyelitis, and I am very sympathetic. I hope you recover soon," and so on. But the American community in Shanghai has doubts as to why the President knows about the illness of an unknown technician. It is faintly heard that President Roosevelt himself suffered from this disease when he was young, and later overcame the disease with a strong will, so he sent his feelings to fellow sufferers based on his past experience. It is heard that the technician was very happy after receiving President Roosevelt's letter of condolence, and his illness suddenly improved.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Factory Cracked Down on Wagener Road - Two Manufacturers Arrested - Red Pills and Machines Confiscated</h3>
<p>Recently, someone has been secretly manufacturing and selling red pills in a box room at 249 Wagener Road in the French Concession. Jin Jiulin, inspector general of the special agency of the French Concession police, learned of this and led detectives Zhang Ziying, Qian Yumin, and Liu Dianlong to secretly search the address at 4 PM the day before yesterday. They arrested two manufacturers on the spot: Le Hongsheng (41 years old, local) and Cha Hongmao (51 years old, from Anhui, living at 300 Yiye Lane, Jale Road). They seized 18 bags of red pills, each bag containing 1,000 pills, and five packages, each package containing 500 pills, a box of red powder, a set of pill-making boards, five baking ovens, six seals, a rolling pin, a scale, three weighing balances, a red pill lamp gun, and several advertising papers, and brought them all to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the First Criminal Court to interrogate them. Police lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated the facts of the case, requesting that the defendants be detained temporarily and the case be investigated further in one week, and requested a trial. Detective Liu Dianlong also reported the details of the crackdown and submitted the evidence. The court verified the report, briefly questioned the defendants, and ordered that the case be investigated further on the 30th of the month and then interrogated again. The two defendants were returned to custody pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>Pile Breaks and Injures Day Laborer Who Dies Tragically - Hole Pierced in Skull - Death Extremely Miserable</h3>
<p>Guo Liushi, a native of Jiangbei living in the rear of the thatched shed on Taiping Street, Hongzhen, 26 years old, was working as a day laborer on the construction site of a new house being built by the Kangyi Foreign Firm at 394 Fulili Road in the French Concession. At 8 AM yesterday morning, Guo was working near the pile driver. One of the piles was driven down halfway, but could not be driven down further due to an obstruction in the ground, so the pile was pulled up, intending to drive it down again. Unexpectedly, the pile broke halfway, causing the upper half of the pile and the thick wire rope to hit Guo on the head. His body fell to the ground, a hole was pierced in his skull, and his brain and blood splattered out. He fainted and lost consciousness instantly, a gruesome sight. He was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital, but his injury was fatal, and he died at 9:30 AM. The hospital reported to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to investigate and summoned the deceased's wife. The body was moved to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. At 3 PM that afternoon, the Second Special District Court was requested to send Prosecutor Wang Ren to the scene with a forensic doctor. It was confirmed that the deceased had died due to being hit on the head by a pile during his lifetime. The court questioned the witness Zhou Fusheng, and ordered that the body be handed over to the deceased's wife, Guo Mei. The deceased's family was extremely poor, so Kangyi Foreign Firm provided 100 yuan to the foreman to purchase clothing and a coffin for a simple funeral.</p>
<h3>Unified Method for Public Telephone Charging Regulations</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation has been actively promoting public telephones to facilitate communication for citizens, 70 to 80 households have now been installed in the Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and Longhua districts. Public telephones are installed in bustling areas and managed by stores on behalf of the bureau. Recently, it has been learned that the charges at various management offices vary, which defeats the bureau's original intention of facilitating the public. In addition to immediately canceling the qualifications of one or two management offices and recruiting new people to replace them, a notice has also been distributed, which is recorded below: It has been reported that the charges at various public telephone offices vary. Some charge 18 copper coins for each call, and customers sometimes pay with a small silver dollar of two dimes, but only receive 28 copper coins in return, which is not right. According to the bureau's regulations, each call within the city costs five cents, which should be properly converted according to today's exchange rate to show fairness. If there are any more cases of overcharging, the qualification for managing the telephone will be revoked immediately once discovered. Please pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>The Temperature in Mid-June Broke the Observatory's 60-Year Record - But Yesterday It Was 1.2 Degrees Higher</h3>
<p>According to the Zilin News, on Monday (the 25th), the temperature in Shanghai suddenly jumped to 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the highest temperature in mid-June since the Xujiahui Observatory was established in 1873.

Historically, the highest temperature in mid-June was in 1893, which was recorded by the Xujiahui Observatory as 100.04 degrees. Last year on the same day, it was only 92 degrees.

<h3>A Belgian, Hamilinck, Kills a Russian Girl with His Self-Driven Car; The Belgian Consulate Pronounces a Fine and Compensation</h3>
<p>A mainland report states that Mr. Hamilinck, a business manager of the Cethey automobile company, on the morning of June 1st, while driving his own car on Avenue Dubail, struck a rickshaw carrying a twelve-year-old Russian girl, Marinoffsky, causing her to die from her injuries in the hospital.

<h3>The Yifei Case Causes Another Disturbance; Yang Binghao's Suicide Is Highly Suspicious; Yifei's Mother Sues in the District Court</h3>
<p>The famous prostitute Yifei Lao Liu, whose real name was Chen Zhujun, married the businessman Xie Peide as a concubine. Xie had spent five thousand yuan to settle Chen's debts. After they lived together, they were very affectionate. Xie would always take her with him to social events. A friend, Yang Qiusun, was the owner of the Puyi Real Estate Company, and his grandson, Yang Binghao, a handsome young man, became acquainted with Chen through Xie's introduction. Over time, they fell in love, and Chen wanted to leave Xie. Xie, upon learning of this, facilitated the matter and arranged for Chen to marry Yang. At the same time, Xie even acted as their wedding officiant. Unexpectedly, one month after the marriage, Yang Qiusun suddenly declared that if Binghao married Chen, he would lose his inheritance rights and have his allowance cut off. He could not have both money and beauty. Thus, he planned for a divorce. Chen immediately moved to the Yang residence located at No. 651 Weihaiwei Road, the Western-style house of Xie's friend, surnamed Hong. Several days later, using Chen's name, she invited Yang Qiusun and Xie Peide to the scene, declaring the termination of the marriage contract. At this time, Yang Binghao requested that Chen go to the bathroom with him for a final, secret conversation. Unexpectedly, Chen was shot and killed by Yang, who also committed suicide. An examination by the First Special District Court revealed that Chen had two gunshot wounds to her temples, while Yang had one gunshot wound under his left rib and one to his right temple. After the bodies were collected, Chen Zhujun's mother, Chen Wangshi, appealed to all parties, stating that the matter was bizarre and that the deceased was murdered, not a suicide. A single gunshot would have been sufficient for suicide; there was no reason for a second shot to be fired. Now, looking at Yang Binghao's two wounds, it is clear that it was not suicide. Moreover, Xie Peide's willingness to give up Chen was not something everyone would be willing to do. It is suspected that he was jealous after the fact and demanded her return. Yang Qiusun is even more suspicious for pressuring Yang Binghao and witnessing the joint murder. She demanded justice. There were rumors of a settlement, but no results. Now, Chen Wangshi has suddenly filed a lawsuit in the Chinese District Court, and prosecutor Yang An is investigating the matter. Yesterday, he ordered Yang Qiusun and Xie Peide, among others, to be summoned for questioning. Yang was in Hangzhou and had not returned, so only Xie appeared. He claimed that he was exceptionally enlightened and was willing to give up Chen to help Yang. He insisted that they committed suicide and presented a suicide note as evidence. The examiner questioned whether the handwriting in the suicide note was indeed that of the deceased and could not confirm it. However, if there were any surviving writings from the deceased that could be used as a comparison, the truth could be clarified. Xie said that he could find such writings. The official then ordered him to produce the evidence and then reconvene for questioning. The judge did not grant the request of the French Concession police because Hamilinck's profession required him to drive a car and he had never caused an accident in his twenty-four years of driving.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>I recently read a news item in your newspaper's local news column entitled "Postal and Telegraph Integration to be Fully Implemented Next Month," in which some of the facts are not entirely accurate. This bureau has repeatedly received instructions from the Ministry of Communications to universally establish telegraph receiving offices in the postal branches of this city by the end of this month. This is currently underway and there is no deadline of July 15th. I am deeply concerned that this may cause misunderstandings in all sectors of society. I am writing to request that your newspaper investigate and correct this. Thank you very much. To the Shen Bao Newspaper.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Do Animals Have Instincts? (II)</h3>
<p>On the 23rd, we briefly discussed the question of whether animals have instincts in response to the question raised by Mr. Wang Deming. We were supposed to continue publishing this article on the 24th, but due to the forgetting of the messenger when sending the manuscript on the night of the 23rd, there was no Reading Q&amp;A on the 24th. Today, we continue to discuss how instincts are encompassed and abandoned by wisdom in humans.</p>
<p>The previous section discussed the question of whether general animals have instincts. We oppose the metaphysical research methods of behaviorists, who unilaterally exaggerate lower-level phenomena (the process of stimulus and response) and forget the special significance of higher-level phenomena (instinct). But on the other hand, if we elevate the special significance of instinct, separating it completely from the phenomena of stimulus and response and treating it as a completely isolated thing, that is also a one-sided view. The biological "vitalism" or "vital force theory" views animal behavior as a special vital action, without linking it to lower-level material actions for research. As a result, animal behavior seems to be driven by a mysterious spirit behind it. This can easily lead people's thinking to idealism or even to religious superstition, which is also to be opposed. Therefore, the material experimental methods of behaviorists are worthy of our respect. In other words, we can accept the research of behaviorists with a critical attitude, agreeing that instinct is just a synthesis of a series of stimuli and responses, but at the same time, once it becomes instinct, it also has the characteristics specific to instinct, which are different from simple stimuli and responses. Our conclusion is: Animals have instincts.</p>
<p>Humans are animals, of course they also have instincts. But humans are different from ordinary animals, so human instincts also have another meaning. Now we will discuss this point.</p>
<p>The difference between humans and animals is that humans can make tools, as Mr. Wang also mentioned. But humans can make tools and use tools to obtain the materials they need, without relying entirely on claws and strength. This makes human life more developed than animal life. Human life is more advanced than animal instinct life. More clearly, human life is a life of wisdom. Of course, if we think that human life is completely different from animal life, that would also fall into a one-sided view. The two most basic instincts, as Mr. Wang said, appetite and sexual desire, are the same for both humans and animals. But animals, to achieve the purpose of these instincts, can only use the organs they are born with, and all behaviors are subject to physiological limitations. Therefore, animal life is purely instinct life. Humans can use tools, use external objects to replace their own organs, which allows humans to transcend instinct life.</p>
<p>People often compare the collective organization of ants with the social organization of humans. This is a mistake. The ant colony is completely based on the physiological structure of the ant. But social organization is the mutual combination of humans because they use tools to carry out production, which is the so-called production relationship. The ant colony is limited by physiology, so the organization of this colony is solidified and cannot be improved or changed. Humans, on the other hand, can constantly improve their production tools and their application methods, develop productive forces, and the relationship between humans also changes accordingly. Revolution is the change in production relations caused by the development of productive forces. Animal colony organization is the organization of an organism, while human colony organization is the organization of a society. The change and evolution of organic organization can only rely on natural selection, while the cause of social change is the increase and development of social productive forces. Human life is so different from animal life.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we do not clearly distinguish between human life and animal life, and think that human behavior is also based on instinct as the standard, this is still a metaphysical view that exaggerates lower-level phenomena and forgets higher-level phenomena. This kind of mistaken view is common. For example, some historians often think that the monarch of one country slaughtered the cities of another country for the sake of seizing beautiful women. This is an example of explaining history with sexual instinct. Another example is the population theory of Malthus in England, which explains the war between nations and countries with overpopulation and insufficient food. This is another example of explaining history with appetite instinct. In fact, these statements are all obscuring the truth.</p>
<p>Judging a person's behavior is also not based on whether the behavior is suitable for instinct as the standard. Love, or even adultery, although it is the expression of instinct, is not necessarily evil, but it is not necessarily always worthy of sympathy. If a person neglects his responsibilities to society because he is obsessed with love, it will still become evil. The standard of good and evil must depend on what significance the person's behavior will have in social relations before it can be determined. In short, to understand society and human behavior, we must study the economic phenomena unique to human society (productive forces, production relations, etc.) and cannot use lower-level animal instincts as the standard of explanation. Of course, human social phenomena are the extension and development of instinct phenomena. We cannot deny that humans and instincts are inseparable. But when instinct comes to humans, it is encompassed and abandoned by something higher, wisdom. Instinct life, at this point, is hidden in wisdom; more precisely, hidden in social life. Because the scope of human wisdom's activities cannot go beyond life.</p>
<p>Therefore, humans are not without instincts, but in human life, instinct only has a secondary meaning and cannot determine the fundamental direction of human behavior. Wisdom is the inherent characteristic in human behavior, while instinct is "appendage." Conversely, in animal life, it is not that there is no budding of wisdom. Apes being able to use branches or stones to hit objects is already the most preliminary application of tools, but this is not the main behavior in the life of apes, but only an occasional behavior. Therefore, apart from humans, the life of animals can be said to be the life of instinct. (The End)</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Records of Lingering Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When the "Bing" cook was starting the fire, no matter how idle the "Jia" and "Yi" temple cooks were, they were unwilling to lend a helping hand. They would rather stare with their eyes wide open to watch from the side, disdaining to move a muscle, because they felt that this kind of lowly work would damage their dignity. I think that anyone who served in the palace, from the chief eunuch to the cleaning servant, could be said to love face and know how to put on airs. This was probably also influenced by the Empress Dowager, right?</p>
<p>After the stove fire was burning brightly, there would inevitably be a strong smell of coal gas. Of course, this was very unhygienic. On the way to Fengtian in the carriage, several eunuchs fell ill because they could not stand this smell. However, they gradually became clever. Every time they started a fire, they would open all the carriage windows, so they no longer heard of anyone suffering from coal poisoning. In addition to opening the windows, there was also another way to reduce the coal gas, which was to open a small hole in the stove. When starting the fire, they would first install a very short chimney on this small hole and point the outlet of the chimney out of the window. In this way, most of the strong coal gas could be blown away. When the coal in the stove was burning very brightly, that is, when it had all turned a transparent red (this kind of coal is extremely resistant to burning, and once it is burning brightly, it can be used for a long time), then they would remove the short chimney.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the time it took to start the fire, the "Bing" cooks always had to use a palm leaf fan to fan the fire gate at the front end of the stove with all their might. But because the position of the fire gate was too low, they had to bend over, making it impossible to fan properly. So, this kind of work was really very hard.</p>
<p>Let's calculate it. There are three cooks, "Jia", "Yi", and "Bing", on each stove, and countless eunuchs transporting things back and forth. The number of people involved is really not small. So, in the four carriages that serve as the imperial kitchen, once it was mealtime, the atmosphere immediately became tense. (68)</p>
<h3>Idle Talk About Waterbirds</h3>
<p>— Xian Zhi</p>
<p>Those who live on islands, surrounded by rivers on all sides, are quite rich in elegance. The depths of the reeds are often places for waterbirds to enter, exit, and rest. Birds such as the spoonbill and the albatross are common birds. They often stop by the water's edge in the morning and evening. Those who know them can also know their nature. They are a notch above the old men who live in the mountains and know the sounds of birds by relying on the mountains.</p>
<p>The spoonbill is a wading bird with a flat beak, shaped like a comb. Therefore, it is also called a "comb heron". The whole body is gray, with no crest on the top of the head. It walks and searches for food among decaying grass and mud, not stopping until it has searched completely, without a moment of rest. That is its nature.</p>
<p>The albatross, also known as the "faith of heaven" (see the Dictionary of Words), is very large, with a wingspan of more than ten feet. The beak is hooked at the end, the wings are black, and the back is gray. It is very strong in flight, and its soft feathers can be used as mattresses. Sometimes it freezes at the edge of the water, standing alone and motionless. When fish pass under it, it catches them. If there are no fish all day, it does not change its place. Even if it does not eat, it does not look hungry, but instead becomes stronger. Its inherent nature is so different. The spoonbill is greedy and insatiable, while the albatross is honest and self-respecting. If this is used to satirize the general corrupt people in the world, what will they think? Ming Lan Tingrui's poem says: "Lotus money and waterweed are green and empty in the river, and carp and shark are eating among the shallow grass. The cormorant on the waves is not satisfied with greed, but the albatross has never starved to death?"</p>
<h3>Summer Night on the Street</h3>
<p>— Yan Bokuang</p>
<p>The terrible summer has descended on the world. The climate is changing with the days, getting hotter day by day.</p>
<p>In the summer season, the sun, holding the highest authority, releases fire-like light, causing people to stay at home during the day, afraid to go out. Naturally, the pedestrians on the street feel sparse. But when the sun sets in the west, a cool breeze blows, and the god of night gradually casts a black curtain over the streets and alleys, suddenly seeing many more people appear, men, women, old, young, from national affairs to neighborhood anecdotes, and affairs of the heart, all are relished. But I wonder if they have ever thought of those compatriots in the Northeast who are trapped in deep water and scorching heat?</p>
<p>Sour plum soup, soda, and ice are all set up according to the needs of the time.</p>
<p>The pedestrians on the street also shuttle back and forth, and the lights of the year, reflecting the brilliance, carry a rich color. The radio broadcasts pleasant songs. It is exactly in harmony with the lullabies and "Peach Blossom River" sung by the women in the alley, echoing each other. At that time, in the dance hall, pairs of lovers are dancing to one melody after another. Although there are electric fans spinning non-stop, they still cannot stop the sweat from flowing from the dance partners. Comparing the two, where can it be compared to the friends who are enjoying the cool on the streets on a summer night? This is really a mysterious summer night, right?</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 31: Three Encounters, White-Clad Charges Against Snow Array, Entire Battalion Sacrifices, Red-Eyed Into Gun Forest</p>
<p>However, two miles past is a mountain gully. We can gain a great advantage by setting up an ambush there. Normally, we would never march so rashly. However, they are deceiving us because we have few people. I expect that they must have a part of them rushing out of there to try. I want to send a company of men to ambush there. Zi Qiang straightened his face and said: Battalion commander, this matter must be considered, right? Our strength is also very weak, and we can't divide it up anymore, right? Bao Fang looked at him with bright eyes and said: Probably you don't dare to go. Zhao Ziqiang suddenly saluted the battalion commander. He also said sternly: The company commander's words are based on the big picture, please instruct the battalion commander whether they are right or wrong. As for ordering the company commander to go there, the company commander will go there. Soldiers must never have the idea of ​​not daring. Bao Fang smiled and nodded, saying: What you said can also be said to be right. But you must know that our battalion is defending this village, and our first priority is to make a profit. If one person kills two of them, we will win. Second, we will talk about waiting for reinforcements. Do you understand what I said? While Bao Fang was saying this, he quickly glanced at the brothers. Zi Qiang understood very well that the battalion commander was now holding the principle of fighting to the death. This principle does not need to be known to the brothers. So, he answered in a very low voice and calmly, I understand. Bao Fang looked him up and down again, and said nothing more. He led him to point and point on the city wall and observed it again. After Bao Fang's instructions, Zi Qiang knew even more where the battalion commander's intention lay. After walking around the fortress for a week, he followed Bao Fang to the battalion headquarters to discuss for a while. When he left the battalion headquarters, the sun was still hanging right overhead. When the sun was slightly west, Zi Qiang had already led all his brothers to the gully. This gully is where three mountain mouths intersect. Therefore, a walking path bends in the middle of the two mountains, forming a gully. From here to attack the north gate of Ping'an Fort, the terrain is relatively high. If the defending army does not defend here, they should at least declare a line of defense outside the north gate, so that the enemy has no room to advance leisurely after leaving the gap. (419)</p>
<h3>Firefly Beauty</h3>
<p>— Jin Erru</p>
<p>Fireflies are flying insects, also known as beneficial insects, because they eat all kinds of pests, which is beneficial to agriculture, hence the name. In summer, they lay eggs in shallow water weeds, which become insects in more than ten days, about three minutes long. The males are yellow, with black heads and compound cheeks, and soft elytra covered with dense dots and lines. The females are wingless and shaped like maggots, with a very strong light-emitting device at the end of the tail. When breathing, air enters, and a biochemical reaction occurs, emitting a beautiful light. During the transition from summer to autumn, when people are enjoying the cool outdoors, they often see firefly lights flashing, going north and coming south, flying to shallow grass, under melon sheds. Children compete to catch them and store them in glass containers, either carrying them as toys or placing them beside their pillows. If there are more insects, gathered in a corner, the strength of their light is no less than that of a Ever-Ready flashlight. When I was young, I also liked to play with this. When I saw fireflies, I always felt that although the firefly light was good, the children's way of playing was ordinary and not worth imitating. So, I racked my brains, thinking day and night, striving to surpass the children. Then, one day, I took an eggshell and went to those elders who were good at painting beautiful women, and asked them to paint the head of a beautiful woman on the eggshell. I took it home and kept it secret from others. In the evening, I caught a group of fireflies, placed them in the eggshell, sealed the mouth, and hung it in a dark place. When the wind blew, suddenly seeing it, with willow eyebrows and almond eyes, and cherry lips, it was quite beautiful.</p>
<h3>The Tale of Ah Feng</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Ah Feng's surname is unknown. She was named because of her skill at weeping, her fame spreading throughout Liangxi. She was around fifty years old, her wrinkled, oval face constantly coated with powder, and she still wore flowers in her hair. Truly, "old age doesn't touch her heart." When people heard her sweet name, "Ah Feng," they still thought she was a charming young woman in her prime. Whenever there was a grand funeral, she was always there to sell her cries, weeping for the young mistress, weeping for the madam, weeping for the master, weeping for... she observed who had died, and her art of weeping was very skillful, changing with the occasion. She could cry until her nose and eyes flowed, her eyeballs as big as walnuts, and everyone praised her weeping as being melodious and well-paced. Therefore, her career as a professional mourner was especially prosperous. Her reputation for skillful weeping thus became widely known. This time, when the coffins of the tragically deceased Madam Qin Gong Yinxia and others were brought back to their hometown, she was also hired to weep. One moment she would cry out for the fine young master Lizhai, the next she would cry out for the good young mistress Yinxia, and the young master and young miss, weeping with extraordinary sorrow. Is Ah Feng a reincarnation of Lin Daiyu? Ah, a tale to be told!</p>
<p>Where the Artistry Leads</p>
<h3>At Hukou</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>On the right bank where Poyang Lake meets the Yangtze River,</p>
<p>there lies an ancient and desolate county, that is Hukou. Mentioning the name Hukou, I immediately think of the Second Revolution, which was a fierce rebellion against Yuan Shikai's masterminding of Song Jiaoren's assassination and his unauthorized borrowing of huge sums of money, because this was the base where the rebellion first broke out! Moreover, Su Shi has an immortal work: "Record of Stone Bell Mountain," which opens by citing the Waterways Classic: "At the mouth of Pengli, there is Stone Bell Mountain." Pengli is Poyang Lake. Therefore, Hukou is also a scenic spot visited by famous people. So, when I heard that I was being sent here, I felt indescribably happy, because visiting scenic spots is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me!</p>
<p>Although Stone Bell Mountain is not as majestic as Guling, from afar one can see the Yangtze River, its surging white waves, scattered sails, fishing boats like leaves, huge and fast-moving steamers, and the tall smokestacks of the steamers spewing thick black smoke, all gathered in our eyes like a painting. Looking down on Poyang, warships stand firmly on the lake, calm and majestic. The vast lake water cannot withstand the attack of hurricanes, churning with restless waves. The heavy sampans, unable to control themselves, are tossed high and low, leaning left and right, how dangerous! Such are the tempests of life!</p>
<p>On the mountain, strangely shaped rocks shimmer, symbolizing all kinds of creatures: there are old men carrying staffs, groups of children squatting on the ground, and tigers with bared fangs and claws. On some rocks are engraved large characters in the style of clerical script, such as "Cloud Root," or poems by refined gentlemen. In addition, there are many interconnected temples and corridors, but also one or two solitary, semi-monastic tree houses. It is said that Zeng Wenzheng Gong, in order to eliminate the Hong Yang rebellion for the Manchu Qing, once trained his navy in Poyang Lake, and the temples were renovated to commemorate him. A natural, simple, and precipitous mountain has been completely covered by these man-made structures that destroy nature. If the mountain spirit knew, I think it would not let it go. I wonder, when Dongpo moored his boat under the cliff at night, what were the temples on this mountain like?</p>
<p>I heard that Chairman Chiang admires Zeng Wenzheng very much. Outside the front gate, there is a long couplet signed by him. Whether it is in his own handwriting, I have no way of knowing. Inside, many walls are inlaid with blue stones of varying sizes, on which are engraved prefaces and regulated poems by some famous people, which I no longer remember. Even along the winding corridor connecting to the front gate, there are such things. I remember that on the walls on both sides of the patio under a great hall, there were also four "soy sauce shop"-style large characters: "Loyalty, Filial Piety, Integrity, and Virtue," which were somewhat similar to the slogans touted by the current "New Life Movement." They are almost identical to the four characters in my hometown's ancestral hall. They are said to be in the handwriting of Zhu Xi, but they are so common that almost every temple or ancestral hall I have visited has them. Who is the real author and who is the copyist, I don't know. Loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and virtue have occupied the minds of the Chinese people for many years. Perhaps these advertising-style admonitions are not without considerable effect. Although Hukou occupies a position with a mountain behind it and a lake in front, it only has a narrow and long street, with sparsely scattered two or three hundred "neither fish nor fowl" shops. In these chaotic years, there is nothing to pass the time, and cinemas are especially out of the question. However, so-called "Yangzhou gangs" who sell their bodies for survival can be encountered everywhere. Their only customers are the local consolidated tax bureau, consumer inspection bureau, and officers and soldiers on warships. We are penniless and find it boring, so we cannot enjoy this convenience. The only thing that can comfort my loneliness as a traveler is the scenery of Stone Bell Mountain, which can be taken "without prohibition."</p>
<p>Although I only stayed in Hukou for three short months, an indelible impression was left in my mind, that is, the so-called bandits entering the city. Right and wrong could not be distinguished in an instant. My bedding, clothes, and everything else were destroyed. My head was also a gamble of five minutes. Who should I sacrifice for? I can only remain silent! Although the XX warship gave me a berth at night, as if my life was insured, there was actually no need to linger. Let's give up from now on! Only a few colleagues who were more like-minded and a few new friends from the Hunan Hukou Elementary School who helped me in times of trouble have not exchanged letters to this day, and I cannot help but feel uneasy!</p>
<p>Three years have passed. Today, while organizing all the photos, I discovered that the photo I took with Liao and Hu at [illegible character] Bell Mountain is missing. Only then did I realize that this wandering life was a dangerous path in life. I send a message to my friends in Hukou: Has the scenery of the lakes and mountains changed?</p>

<h3>Zhou Fo-hai Discusses the Implementation of Secondary Education in Jiangsu (Part Two)</h3>
<p>Speaking of this, I cannot but briefly report on the allocation of secondary education funds in Jiangsu Province and the recent plans of this Department. The recurring expenditure for secondary education in Jiangsu Province is 2,136,403 yuan this year. Of this, vocational schools account for 19.23%, totaling 411,841 yuan; normal schools account for 3.93%, totaling 660,990 yuan; and middle schools account for 49.84%, totaling 1,063,572 yuan. Compared with the standards set by the Ministry, vocational schools are short by 15.77%, normal schools exceed by 5.93%, and middle schools exceed by 9.84%. Although the difference is not far, it is not easy to immediately meet the standards promulgated by the Ministry. Therefore, this Department adopts a phased tightening approach for middle schools and normal schools and a phased expansion approach for vocational schools, and it is expected to be completed within three years. Now that the 23rd year is approaching in a blink of an eye, this Department has formulated an implementation plan for the increase and decrease of various undertakings of provincial secondary schools. The content of this plan is: 1. Middle schools and normal schools will achieve independence. The ordinary high school courses jointly established by normal schools and the normal school courses jointly established by middle schools will be abolished and no longer enroll students. 2. Provincial Songjiang Middle School, Yancheng Middle School, and Lianyungang Simplified Rural Normal School will be converted into vocational schools, which is expected to be completed in the 25th year. 3. Yixing Public Vocational School will be taken over by the province and converted into a senior agriculture and forestry course. 4. Suzhou Industrial School will add a textile machinery factory and a machinery course to complete three courses. Shanghai Middle School originally had a business course and will convert the graduating classes of both the senior normal and senior general courses into engineering courses and genius classes. The applied chemistry course at Suzhou Middle School and the civil engineering course at Yangzhou Middle School will be strengthened. From the first item, one grade of the senior normal course originally in Nanjing Middle School, Nanjing Girls' Middle School, Shanghai Middle School, Songjiang Girls' Middle School, Yangzhou Middle School, and Tongzhou Middle School, and one grade of the senior normal course originally in Suzhou Middle School will graduate in the second semester of this year, and no senior normal courses will be recruited in the next year, nor will any senior general courses be added. In fact, it is no different from reducing eight grades of senior general courses, and one grade that Nanjing Middle School's senior general course should naturally increase in the next year will also be reduced. One grade of the senior general course originally in Suzhou Women's Normal School will graduate in the second semester of this year, and no senior general courses will be recruited, nor will any senior normal courses be added. In fact, it is no different from reducing one grade of senior normal courses. One grade of the senior general course originally in Wuxi Normal School, Taizhou Normal School, Haimen Normal School, and Huai'an Normal School will also graduate in the second semester of this year, and no senior normal courses will be added, but each will add one grade of teacher training courses, totaling a reduction of nine grades of senior general courses and six grades of senior normal courses, and an increase of five grades of teacher training courses. From the second item, Songjiang Middle School and Yancheng Middle School will each reduce one grade of ordinary courses and increase one grade of vocational courses. From the third item, Yixing Public Vocational School will reduce one grade of junior middle school ordinary courses and increase one grade of junior agriculture and forestry courses. From the fourth item, Shanghai Middle School will reduce one grade of ordinary courses and increase one grade of engineering courses, and Suzhou Industrial School will add one grade of machinery courses and naturally increase two grades. In addition, Yixing Ceramics Vocational School will add one grade of junior vocational courses, and Shihhu and Lianyungang will each add one grade of rural normal courses. In total, there will be a reduction of twelve grades of senior general courses, one grade of junior middle school, and six grades of senior normal courses, and an increase of six grades of senior vocational courses, two grades of junior vocational courses, five grades of teacher training courses, and two grades of rural normal courses. The one grade of Lianyungang Rural Normal School is a fishing village normal course. For the first three years, it is purely vocational training related to fisheries, and in the last year, various educational subjects that elementary school teachers should study are taught to prepare those who aspire to be elementary school teachers, in accordance with the special environment of the area. In fact, it is no different from a junior vocational course. The expenditure allocation standards for the 23rd year compiled based on this plan have also changed greatly compared to this year. The total expenditure for the 23rd year is 2,178,123 yuan, of which vocational schools account for 25.02%, totaling 544,904 yuan; normal schools account for 29.53%, totaling 643,323 yuan; and ordinary middle schools account for 45.45%, totaling 989,896 yuan. Compared to this year, vocational schools have increased by 5.79%, totaling more than 133,000 yuan; normal schools have decreased by 1.40%, totaling more than 17,600 yuan; and middle schools have decreased by 4.39%, totaling more than 73,600 yuan. Looking at it this way, there have been considerable increases and decreases in the expenditure of various educational items within one year. In the future, increases will be made where they should be increased, and decreases will be made where they should be decreased. It is expected that the standards promulgated by the Ministry will not be difficult to achieve in three years by the 26th year. As for the expenditure of county-level secondary education, the situation is more complicated, and each has its own special history. If it is also to be allocated according to the standards promulgated by the Ministry, this is impossible, because the educational expenditure budget of each county in Jiangsu Province has always been divided into administrative expenses, ordinary education expenses, compulsory education expenses, and social education expenses. The expenses of senior elementary schools and ordinary middle schools and vocational schools belong to ordinary education expenses, and the expenses of junior elementary schools and normal schools belong to compulsory education expenses. In order to prevent encroachment, the use of funds for each item is restricted and cannot be diverted. If we want to overturn the precedent and redistribute, difficulties will inevitably arise. In addition, the secondary education expenditure of each county is limited, and very few counties can run middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools at the same time. Therefore, the allocation of funds cannot meet the standards promulgated by the Ministry in any way. In order to restrict private secondary schools, the education bureaus of each county have been ordered to stop enrolling or close all county-level junior normal schools from the 23rd year, and use the saved funds to add rural junior elementary schools. At the same time, the grades of each provincial rural normal school will be appropriately expanded to meet the needs of the elementary schools in each county. County-level and private middle schools must not be arbitrarily expanded and should find ways to promote vocational schools, and several measures have been stipulated, namely: 1. County-level middle schools that originally run single-track systems must not expand grades on the pretext of a large number of students going on to higher education. Those that originally run double-track systems will gradually reduce enrollment from the 23rd year, and all five-year systems will be changed to single-track by the 26th year. (2) Counties that have already run vocational schools should find ways to expand them, and those that have not run them should immediately prepare to establish them. The expenses will be covered by the reduced middle school expenses or newly added expenses. In case of financial limitations, vocational supplementary schools should also be established to train students who cannot go on to higher education in productive skills. (3) Private middle schools that have been registered and are located in areas with a large number of ordinary middle schools should be supervised and persuaded to reduce the number of ordinary grades and gradually convert them into vocational schools or vocational supplementary schools. (4) From the 23rd year, private individuals who prepare to establish middle schools should immediately be supervised and persuaded to convert them into vocational schools or vocational supplementary schools. If the funds are not very abundant, they should be directly persuaded to convert them into elementary schools to show restriction. The above measures are all intended to slightly restrict county-level and private secondary education to prevent its natural expansion. In the future, this Department will, in accordance with the established policy, make appropriate adjustments in accordance with the needs of the environment, in order to achieve the appropriate development of secondary education in the province and prevent the past abuses of excessive expansion of middle schools and normal schools, which resulted in graduates lacking employment opportunities. At the same time, strict restrictions will be placed on the admission of new students to each middle school, and they must not be accepted indiscriminately unless they meet the standards. The standards for enrolling new students in senior high schools will be particularly raised to make middle school education a true education for talent. This year, the entrance examinations for all public and private senior high school students in the province will be centralized in this Department, and a committee will be organized by this Department to set the questions, grade the papers, and handle the examinations uniformly. This is the belief of this brother in secondary education in Jiangsu Province, and I hope that the people of Jiangsu will understand this and give their support.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Department of Education Promotes Special Education ▲400 People's Schools Can Be Established by the End of This Year ▲Youth Participating in Service Corps Are Very Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Cheng Shixue, the director of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, announced the recent situation of promoting important policies. They are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Special Education</h3>
<p>The purpose of special education is to correct the erroneous thinking of the masses, train local self-defense, increase rural production, and seek to achieve the simultaneous implementation of education and defense. First, special education teacher training classes, research classes, and summer training classes will be organized. The first batch of graduates has been assigned to various counties in the recovered areas to run Sun Yat-sen People's Schools. The plans for the first batch of schools stipulate that 80 schools will be established in 20 county districts and must be fully established within this month. The second batch of trainees and summer training class trainees will continue to be trained and sent to work in various counties after graduation. It is estimated that 400 Sun Yat-sen People's Schools can be established by the end of this year. After the research class trainees graduate, they can go to work in various counties. It is estimated that in July next year, 50 counties will have special education instructors. Within three years, all counties in the recovered areas will be able to establish Sun Yat-sen People's Schools and set up special education training. This kind of Sun Yat-sen People's School is to improve agricultural economy and technology, assist rural self-defense, and promote rural self-government with the spirit of political and educational integration. Therefore, the school is the center for improving society, and the principal and teachers are truly the leaders of the local area. The teaching methods are not only about literacy and reading, pointing and speaking, but also about finding ways to develop rural side businesses, promote rural improvement, guide rural cooperative undertakings, organize rural self-defense groups, promote the New Rural Life Movement, improve customs, and promote national arts. The organization of the school is divided into three types of classes for children, adults, and women, with the aim of universal education.</p>
<h3>Summer Facilities</h3>
<p>There are three major policies in this summer: first, the youth</p>
<p>The organization of the holiday service corps has already held its first</p>
<p>meeting. There are now more than 15,000 participants. The youth students whose holidays have arrived will return to their hometowns separately. If they can work hard in accordance with the service regulations, good results are expected. The second is to make up for academic subjects during the summer vacation. In addition to setting up a summer school in Lushan, it is planned to divide the province into seven districts and set up schools in each district. The cost of each district is 1,000 yuan. In addition to the 400 yuan subsidized by the Department of Education, the remaining funds are raised locally and are compulsory in nature. At least two-thirds of the students must participate in the tutoring. The third is military training for graduates during the summer vacation. The implementation plan and budget have been planned and completed by the National Military Education and Training Committee and will begin when the graduation joint examination is completed. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Civic Training</h3>
<p>The civic education in the provincial capital is to organize and train the masses to impart knowledge of practical life and simple military training to answer modern citizens. Its significance is very important. All citizens of the provincial capital are given training in stages, each stage lasting three months and completing in one year. The first phase has already begun. According to statistics, there are 19 trained Baozhang, 910 Jiazhang, and 10,580 trained citizens. In addition, the China Vocational Education Society will hold the 14th member congress and the 12th National Vocational Education Discussion Conference in Nanchang from the 13th to the 15th of next month and has been preparing for it.

<p>Sports News</p>
<h3>Opening of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships ▲ Wood Defeats McGrath in Straight Sets ▲ No Unexpected Changes in the Opening Matches</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 25th) The Wimbledon Tennis Championships, a gathering of the world's best tennis players, opened late this morning due to incessant showers. Throughout the day, the weather remained uncertain with alternating sunshine and rain. Some matches in the first week of the men's singles were still completed after the rain, and no unexpected events occurred.</p>
<h3>Wood's Fierce Performance</h3>
<p>Both young American players appeared on the court. Wood was even stronger than when he won the championship in 1931, defeating Australian Davis Cup player McGrath in straight sets. Wood's serve was excellent, leaving McGrath at a loss several times. Shields defeated the Jewish German Pullen, who came from Soviet Russia this year to participate. Shields won easily in straight sets.</p>
<h3>Pan Lei and Austin Promoted</h3>
<p>Two important British players, Pan Lei and Austin, both won. Pan defeated his compatriot De Ge, the army champion, very easily. Austin defeated the veteran Indian Slim, losing only six games in total.</p>
<h3>Crawford's Difficult Victory</h3>
<p>The defending champion, Crawford, exerted all his strength to defeat Poland's Truszczynski, 6-2, 7-5, 8-6. One of the longest matches of the day was the Italian Stefani's victory over Monaco's Raud, 7-5, 10-8, 7-9, 7-5. Stefani showed none of the brilliance he displayed in the French Open when he defeated Pan Lei, and almost caused an upset. The French Pouces defeated the young British Hale very easily.</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Players Win</h3>
<p>The Japanese Nakamura eliminated the British Dowell with great difficulty. Nakamura found it difficult to show his true colors due to the soft ground, and it took four sets to decide the victory. He gradually showed his progress, and his swift forehand and backhand draws were exceptionally accurate.</p>
<p>Miki Katsusai Er, straight sets, Gao hit the ball powerfully, all freestyle, the Japanese did not take off the wool coat throughout the game, both sides drew the bottom line, but Miki sometimes went to the net.</p>
<p>Teng Cang eliminated the French Duplaix, straight sets, the Frenchman's strange serve and unstable backhand succumbed to Fujikura's net buckle.</p>
<h3>Dissatisfaction with the Referee</h3>
<p>The focus of today's commentary was the referee, and many players protested, saying that the referee's lack of skill was unprecedented. The reason was that the refereeing association forced Wimbledon to use chairs higher than in the past, measuring five feet six inches. It is said that this was the cause of the incident, and it has been heard that a request has been made to use the lower chairs of the past. Some players even said that they failed due to the referee's mistakes. This kind of commentary is unprecedented in Wimbledon, because unless there is a very good reason, players maintain sportsmanship.</p>
<h3>Results of the First Week of Opening</h3>
<p>The results of the first week today are as follows:</p>
<p>Wood (US) defeated McGrath (Australia), 10-8, 6-4, 6-4,</p>
<p>Shields (US) defeated Pullen (Russia), 6-3, 6-3, 6-4,</p>
<p>Pan Lei (England) defeated De Ge (England), 6-2, 6-2, 5-7, 6-0,</p>
<p>Austin (England) defeated Slim (India), 6-3, 6-1, 6-3,</p>
<p>Crawford (Australia) defeated Truszczynski (Poland), 6-2, 7-5, 8-6,</p>

<h3>First, Make Vernacular Chinese Real Speech</h3>
<p>— Xia Mianzun</p>
<p>The vernacular Chinese since the May Fourth Movement, because the promoters were all people who were originally accustomed to writing classical Chinese, they were all from the intellectual class, and the writing was all about thought and academics, and had no connection with the masses at all. It is called vernacular Chinese, but in fact, it is just replacing the original "zhi hu zhe ye" with "de le ma ne," forcibly inserting the accent of blue-green Mandarin. Everything is preconceived, and not long after the creation of vernacular Chinese, such a cavity was created, and it is still stagnating in this cavity today. At that time, the people who promoted vernacular Chinese had a slogan called "clear as speech." Really, it's just "like speech," and it hasn't reached the level of "is speech." In other words, vernacular Chinese is actually a "non-speech" labor thing.</p>
<p>The biggest shortcoming of vernacular Chinese is the poverty of vocabulary. Classical Chinese has its vocabulary, dialects have their vocabulary, vernacular Chinese is neither classical Chinese nor dialect, but a kind of blue-green Mandarin. Most of the words used in classical Chinese have been deleted, and the unique words in various dialects have also been completely eliminated. As a result, what is left is only a few words that are commonly used by each other. So when writing novels, if you are not careful, the peasant woman also shouts "revolution" and the maid also talks about "love." The spoken language of the compiled operas can make the people in the audience confused.</p>
<p>For example, the words "father" and "mother" used in vernacular Chinese now are very ridiculous. In fact, we all call "baba," "ye," "die," "niang," "ma," or "mu ma," and never call "father" or "mother." But vernacular Chinese wants to use the titles "father" and "mother," even in elementary school textbooks for six or seven-year-old children, the words "father" and "mother" are used. "Grandparents, wives and children walk to send each other off," the Tang Dynasty poem already called "grandparents," but now we call them "father" and "mother," isn't this strange?</p>
<p>To improve vernacular Chinese, to make vernacular Chinese have contact with the masses, the first step is to make it speech.</p>
<p>The current vernacular Chinese is simply too non-speech. The use of words should be adopted as much as possible the living language used by the masses, and dialects should be absorbed as much as possible within the possible scope. All the living language used by the masses, whether it is dialect or newly created language, has its special flavor, which often cannot be replaced by other similar words. For example, "kai you" has become a living language used by the masses in the Shanghai area, and has its special flavor. If we dislike it as vulgar and use words such as "cheating" and "malpractice" to graft it, it will be estranged.</p>
<p>As long as someone uses dialects, the locality will be reduced. For example, the phrase "xiang sha you jie shi" has become universal because many people use it. In future dictionaries, on the one hand, dead words from ancient times should be deleted, and on the other hand, more dialects should be searched and listed.</p>
<p>Abandoning the ready-made living language used by the masses, deliberately translating it once with similar language, and then writing it into the text, this is the old problem of classical Chinese. Although vernacular Chinese has been painfully changed for this, unfortunately, it has not been completely reformed, and as a result, the emotions expressed are still not very kind and flavorful. I have a friend who has never married. When others act as a matchmaker for him, he always asks, "Is that woman a fellow villager?" He doesn't want to marry a woman from another province. The reason is: if the wife is not a fellow villager,</p>
<p>的. This is very wonderful. The current vernacular Chinese, between the author and the reader, is like a couple who do not speak the same dialect, using blue-green Mandarin to whisper love words to each other, which is so estranged and unbearable.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Correspondence "The Naturalness and Inevitability of the Revival of Classical Chinese"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Mo</p>
<p>The "humorous" lawsuit at sea has not yet ended, and the capital is again embroiled in a debate between classical and vernacular Chinese. Wu Yinyin's article defending vernacular elementary school textbooks has sparked several lengthy articles using vernacular as a target, continuously published in the Central Daily News. What particularly caught my attention was Mr. Xu Chenzhou's article "The Naturalness and Inevitability of the Revival of Classical Chinese." First, the title is so decisive, with "inevitability" following "naturalness," even an experienced judge wouldn't be so certain. However, the addition of the suffix "-ness" to both "natural" and "inevitable" feels somewhat awkward. The character "性 (ness)" has of course appeared in the classics and was even praised by sages, but since the Japanese have abused it, terms like "acute-ness," "chronic-ness," "male-ness," and "female-ness" have become fashionable buzzwords, especially favored by "those who blindly believe in vernacular." "Naturalness" and "inevitability" also fall into this category. I've heard that around the time of the Reform Movement, officials were secretly influenced by Liang Qichao's importation of Japanese terms, and words like "trend" and "influence" also appeared in official documents, even among Kang and Liang's political opponents. Mr. Xu's use of the "-ness" suffix, judging by the Spring and Autumn Annals' principle of criticizing the virtuous, is best omitted, or changed to "固然 (certainly)" and "必至 (inevitably)," which are both from classical texts and comparable to Su Laoquan's "On Distinguishing Traitors," remaining relevant for ages.</p>
<p>Second, after enumerating the evils brought about by vernacular Chinese in the four aspects of seeing, reading, writing and composition, Mr. Xu said, "Since the eighth year of the Republic (1919) to now, almost fifteen years have passed. Even young children have already become college students or college graduates. The experiment of vernacular education has reached a single cycle and is about to begin again. Whether the results are good or bad is already clear to the world. If we do not reflect on this and blindly continue, if our compatriots are all uneducated, if China is an uneducated country, the time of our demise will definitely not wait for the second cycle." How well said, Mr. Xu! "The way of heaven revolves like the stars, when things reach their extreme, they will revert." Classical Chinese, having been in misfortune for over a decade, according to the principles of rise and fall, should have died a natural death long ago, especially since its disasters have extended to the nation! Third, literature carries the Way, as the ancients taught. The revival of classical Chinese means the Way is also within it. Therefore, Mr. Xu concludes, "Fortunately, fortunate are those few who are prescient and enlightened, who understand that saving the nation begins with education, and that the most urgent task in education is classical Chinese. They have unanimously risen up, striving to revive the classical Chinese movement, responding to the demands of reality, leading the nation, correcting the mistakes of the past fifteen years, and nurturing the vitality of the four hundred million people, without hesitation and without shirking responsibility. To revive means to restore what is inherent in our country, which is not a difficult task. Scholars must understand this, then their studies will have a sharp weapon. Having lost this weapon in the past, their studies were fruitless. Now that they have found it again, all academic subjects will be easily solved. Teachers must also know that learning first establishes what is great. Those who aim for the distant will not be distracted by what is small and near, so as to assist students in realizing their noble ambitions. The government should understand that what the three provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangsu are doing is a natural and inevitable reform after the failure of the vernacular education experiment, without any intention of diverging from the government's direction, but actually assisting where the government is lacking. They should be commended and used as an example to the nation. In less than ten years, Chinese scholarship will be renowned throughout the world." In fact, Mr. Xu's ideas are not yet exhausted. The fate of the nation is tied to the fate of its literature. Now that there are "prescient and enlightened" people like Xu Chenzhou, Weng Shuiping, Wang Maozu, and Liu Jizhi who are reversing the fifteen years of decline, the revival of classical Chinese is inevitable, and the prosperity of the nation can be expected soon. The achievements of these gentlemen are comparable to those of Yu who controlled the floods and fierce beasts.</p>
<p>However, this old-fashioned, new eight-legged essay can also be subjected to a reverse inference based on logic. That is to say, if the nation is already showing signs of prosperity, its literature will naturally flourish. If the morals and values of society have returned to those of the Three Dynasties, then the vernacular, with its teachings of theft and lasciviousness, its cat and dog language, will naturally disappear. Judging from recent events, the wolves on Purple Mountain no longer conceal their behavior. Although this is thanks to the blessings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, the transformation extends even to jackals and wolves, turning great problems into small ones, and small ones into nothing. This is truly a sign of the nation's fortunes turning from bad to good. Dancing has been strictly prohibited, and strict separation of the sexes is enforced in swimming. In addition to the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace, the six-character mantra of Amitabha, "Om Mani Padme Hum," has been added. The morality and values of society are sure to be rectified. There has never been a case of a nation prospering while its morals and values are corrupt. There has never been a case of the morals and values of society being rectified while classical Chinese is not revived. Observing this great turning of the universe, Mr. Xu and other gentlemen have taken on the responsibility of reviving classical Chinese. Mr. Xu and the other gentlemen are truly men of virtue!</p>
<p>Finally, I must declare that I am an unrepentant believer in vernacular Chinese. There are many places in this article where I am speaking on behalf of the sages, and in my reckless writing, I inevitably resort to classical phrases. If there are any inappropriate points, I hope the "prescient and enlightened" figures of the classical Chinese revival will offer their guidance.</p>

<h3>On Re-translation</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>Mr. Mu Mutian, in the "Torch" on the 21st, opposed writers writing trivial travelogues, believing that it would be better to introduce to China some of the masterpieces of literature from Greece and Rome to the present day. I think this is a very practical piece of advice. But in "Free Talk" on the 19th, he opposed indirect translation, saying it "is a slippery way out," although he attached some forgivable conditions. This conflicts with what he said later and is easily misleading, so I would like to say a few words. Is re-translation really easier than direct translation? First of all, there is the advantage that the original text makes the translator feel inferior and afraid to write, because some of the good parts have already been eliminated by the original translator. Translations are generally inferior to the original, and even translating Chinese Cantonese into Mandarin, or Mandarin into Shanghainese, is difficult to do perfectly. Re-translation reduces hesitation about the merits of the original. Secondly, in difficult places, faithful translators often have annotations that can be understood at a glance, which may not be available in the original book. But therefore, there are often times when direct translations are wrong, but indirect translations are not.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly correct to argue that one should translate the literature of a country one understands well, but if this were the case, it would be difficult for China to have translations of literary masterpieces from ancient Greece and Rome to the present day. The foreign languages that Chinese people understand best are probably English and then Japanese. If there were no re-translations, we would only be able to see many English, American, and Japanese works of literature, and we would not only not have Ibsen and Ibn Khaldun, but we would not even be able to see Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales or Cervantes' "Don Quixote," which are extremely popular. What a pitiful perspective this is! Of course, China may not be without people who are proficient in Danish, Norwegian, and Spanish, but they have not yet translated them, and all we have now are re-translations from English. Even Soviet works are mostly re-translated from English and French.</p>
<p>So I think that we don't need to have strict fortresses for translation at the moment. The most important thing is to look at the quality of the translation, and it is not necessary to focus on whether it is a direct translation or an indirect translation, and it is not necessary to ask whether it is speculative. A re-translation by a trendsetter who has a thorough understanding of the original translation will sometimes be better than a direct translation by a faithful translator who does not fully understand the original. The "Complete Works of Gorky" translated by the Japanese Kaizo-sha was once criticized by some revolutionaries as speculative, but when the revolutionaries' translations came out, the superiority of the former became apparent. However, I must also add a condition: a quick translation by a trendsetter who does not really understand the original translation is really unforgivable. When direct translations of various masterpieces become available in the future, re-translations should be eliminated, but that translation must be better than the old translation. It cannot just be used as a shield by using "direct translation."</p>
<h3>Impressions of Zibo</h3>
<p>— Luo Wang</p>
<p>(2) Luda Coal Mine</p>
<p>We took the Jiaoji Railway to Zhangdian, changed to the Zhangbo branch line, and arrived at Zichuan Station in less than an hour.</p>
<p>Zichuan is a well-known coal mining area in China. After our lectures, we made a special trip to visit the largest mine!! It is the coal mine of Luda Company!! It's a pity that such a great treasure is no longer ours in reality.</p>
<p>This coal mine is about seven miles away from Zichuan City, and its local name is Dahuangdi. It was originally forcibly leased by the Germans for killing German missionaries in Caozhou during the Qing Dynasty, and then seized by the Japanese when the European War broke out. It is said that when the Japanese received the coal mine and checked the original contract, they discovered the confusion of our country's diplomats. The mining contract stated: The size of the mining area, "East stops at Dongshan, North stops at the railway::" The Dongshan mentioned here refers to "the mountain on the east side," and North stops at "the railway," which railway it is, all are vague and unverifiable! In fact, the scope is so large that it includes the entire Zichuan County.</p>
<p>When the European War stopped, the Zichuan coal mine was nominally recovered by China and changed to a Sino-Japanese joint venture, but China actually still held only a nominal title. It is said that now the employees of Luda Company, the top level, such as managers and assistants, and the bottom level workers, are all Chinese, and the middle level who hold the real power are all Japanese. The so-called managers often receive dry salaries every month and live in the concessions of Dalian and Tianjin. No one understands the real situation of the company. Everything is controlled by the Japanese. What is most infuriating is that when we visited the Western-style staff dormitory in the mining area, everything was Japanese-style. Only Japanese staff were allowed to live there. Chinese staff not only did not have the qualifications to live there, but were not even allowed to go in and take a look.</p>
<p>As for the workers' wages and actual living conditions, no one can find out clearly. If you ask them, they will not tell the truth. It is said that the Ministry of Industry and the Department of Construction have sent people to investigate, but they have not obtained accurate results.</p>
<p>The coal mine of Luda Company is one of the largest mining areas in China. The scale is as grand as the Bo Dong Company's coal mine in Boshan. The miners go up and down the mine shaft using electric elevators. The mine is more than 300 meters deep (some say more than 700 meters). There are electric trams and horse-drawn carriages below. There are steel frames above the mine shaft, connecting to light railways. The coal coming out of the mine can be transported to another coal washing plant at any time for selection, grading, and using electricity, it is quickly loaded. Sometimes it is loaded onto coal transport cars and sent to the branch station of the Jiaoji Road. The scale is indeed not bad.</p>
<p>Outside the company, there is a large water exchange pool. It is said that exchanging cold water and hot water can save water waste. This is a rare facility in China.</p>
<p>Zichuan produces a lot of coal, which is exclusively for the use of Japanese warships. Therefore, the Japanese regard the coal production of Zibo as the lifeline of the navy.</p>
<p>As for the name of "Sino-Japanese joint venture," it is only a name, and in fact, it is just spending the blood and sweat of the Chinese people to dig treasures and dedicate them to the "Japanese Empire" for the use of military aggression!</p>
<h3>Get Drunk (Prose Poem by Baudelaire)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yun Wen</p>
<p>You should get drunk. That’s all there is to it: it’s the only question. In order not to feel the horrible burden of Time weighing you down and crushing you to the earth, you must get drunk without ceasing.</p>
<p>On what? Wine, poetry, or virtue, as you wish. But get drunk.</p>
<p>And if sometimes, on the steps of a palace, on the green grass of a ditch, in the mournful solitude of your room, you wake up, drunkenness already diminished or gone, ask the wind, the wave, the star, the bird, the clock, everything that flees, everything that groans, everything that rolls, everything that sings, everything that speaks, ask what time it is; and the wind, wave, star, bird, clock will answer you: "It is time to get drunk! So as not to be the martyred slaves of Time, get drunk; get drunk, and never stop! On wine, poetry, or virtue, as you wish."</p>

<h3>Financial: Overseas Silver Market Unsatisfactory, Fixed Gold Price Rebounds 3.4 Yuan</h3>
<p>The closing time of the market will be changed to 4:00 PM starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>The gold market rebounded yesterday because the silver market was not satisfactory, and the market atmosphere turned calm. The selling momentum has stopped. In the morning, the overseas silver market rose in England but remained flat in the United States. The forward silver prices on the Five Metals Exchange, except for the July contract, which shrank slightly, rose from 2.5 to 8.7 points. Exchange rates fell slightly. London spot gold was flat. U.S. cotton rose 18 pounds, U.S. wheat shrank 2.375 points, and U.S. stocks also fell slightly. In addition, large speculators said that the United States sold below the posted price of .625 after the market closed, which stabilized people's minds. The opening price of raw materials was flat, but rose sharply immediately. The pre-market transactions outside the exchange opened and immediately rose to 83.4 yuan, and then continued to rise. It was heard that the situation after the market was calm, but because the banks were selling, it fell slightly. People's minds were stable, and Chinese merchants were still diligent in purchasing. The domestic market remained stable, and large households took advantage of the low prices to buy, which was still able to pull up the market. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced that the English and American exchange rates remained unchanged. At this time, the market situation was mediocre, and the supply and demand were balanced, hovering between 4 and 5 yuan. Later, the news that the silver price in the Seattle night market remained unchanged and rose .25.375 did not affect the market. On the contrary, the exchange market tightened due to banks buying forward U.S. dollars, and the gold price gradually increased. However, because the supply was still strong after the rise, there was still a decline. The situation was quite stable at noon. The market was calm after the Seattle night market silver price was reported to be unchanged and rose .125.25. Later, due to the banks' strong appetite, they bought the September U.S. dollar in large quantities. As a result, there were more buyers in the market, and the gold price rose. However, the trading volume was low, and it showed a hovering trend after entering the market. Later, after large households sold slightly, and there was news that Mumbai had risen by six annas, retail investors followed suit and sold, so the price fell back slightly after rising. However, people's minds were finally stable, and there was no major decline. The closing was calm, and there was a 4.1 yuan spread for the day. As a result, it rebounded by 3.4 yuan. The market situation was mediocre, and there was no turmoil. The price of pure gold was 1,003 yuan. The market situation for the day will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 994 yuan, up 2.1 yuan from the previous close. The opening price of raw materials was 3.9 yuan. The exchange market opened in the morning with the recent selling price of English exchange rate at one shilling four pence .0625 and the American exchange rate at 33.75 yuan. Dingkang and raw material purchase orders rose to 4.5 yuan.

Sanjing selling September U.S. dollar at 33.9375, Dadecheng Ruikang Hongli supplying, falling to 4.1 yuan. HSBC announced that the English and American exchange rates remained unchanged, and people's minds were still stable. Cuitai Fuyu purchase orders hovered, HSBC buying September U.S. dollar at .9375, Heng Yu entered at 5.2 yuan. Raw materials and Hengtai had slightly offered sales orders, gradually falling to 3.9 yuan. Benefiting from Yu Cuitai Yifeng Yongheng Yu Dadecheng Zhengchang and other purchases, Citibank and Magali bought October U.S. dollar at 34 yuan, and the trend was rising. Yingfeng Hengda Lianbang Huixiang Yuanchang Yongfuyu and others scrambled to buy, and the price rose to 6.7 yuan. Although Yuqing Yong sold at 6.1 yuan, buyers were still strong, and the price rose to 6.8 yuan. However, the supply was quite strong at high prices, and Yuqing Yong Fu'an Hengyu Dingkang sold one after the other, and the price fell to 4.7 yuan. Cuitai Fuchang Fuyu bought one after another at low prices, and the price rose back to 5.5 yuan. The noon closing price was 995.4 yuan, and raw materials traded at 5.3 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 995. Corner and raw materials opened at 5.1 yuan. The silver price in the Seattle night market was unchanged and rose .125.25. The market situation was calm, and then it was 5.1 yuan. Yuanchun and Dalian helped to purchase, and Huabi ate October U.S. dollar at 34 yuan, rising to 6.7 yuan. Fuyu and raw materials sold, once falling to 5.9 yuan. Banks bought October U.S. dollar at 34 yuan quite vigorously. Chunyuan Yongfuyu Yuanmao Yongheng Yu Yuanheng jointly purchased, and the price rose to 6.9 yuan. Yuqing Yong Dadecheng sold, falling to 6.1 yuan. At this time, Yuanmao Yong and others still had purchases, and there was a lot of hovering, because the banks' appetite was very strong. When Changsheng Yong Yuqing Yong Heng Yu came to sell, the price fell to within 6 yuan. There was news that Mumbai had risen by six annas, and retail investors also sold. In addition, Hengyu Dadecheng Senchang Yong also sold, and the situation suddenly became weak, falling to 4.3 yuan.

<h3>Securities Have Ample Chips, Bond Market Fluctuations Are Significant, Financial Circles Take Advantage of High Prices to Sell, Bullish Defenses Slightly Shake</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, trading in June futures had already ceased, and only July futures were being traded. The market prices were turbulent, with unexpected fluctuations. In reality, excessively high prices easily lead to the sale of physical goods, which is a matter worthy of attention. Do not forget danger when prices are high. Even during market stability, the abundance and overuse of chips, as well as the outflow of physical goods, are enough to shock the market. Observing the wild selling of Numbers 4, 16, 37, and 46, all of which were large accounts with strong financial backing from the financial community and certain savings associations, is enough to shake the bullish defenses. This setback in the future has made the bulls more wary, so it will not be easy to calm the fluctuations for a while. In the two morning sessions yesterday, there were few sellers, and retail investors were extremely enthusiastic to buy, and market prices turned up again. The first session of "Jin Duan" (Golden Short) and the second session of "Cai Bing" (Troop Reduction) each rose by more than half a jiao, almost recovering to the highest prices of the previous day. In the afternoon, Numbers 4 and 16 sold off one after another, and for a time, sellers surged. Later, Numbers 37 and 46 also joined the selling side, and the force became stronger and the selling pressure intensified. The opening price of "Jin Duan" fell sharply by more than eight jiao, and unfounded rumors in the market arose at the same time. Some said that a large number of financial institutions were settling accounts, while others said that a certain savings association had too much inventory and was selling at high prices, with a large quantity. There were even rumors about the political situation, which made people feel even more discouraged. At the close, "Cai Bing" also fell sharply by six and a half jiao. Later, with the rise of the unified salt tax, the trading floor covered short positions. Number 53 made some purchases, and market prices recovered slightly by one or two jiao. However, "Zheng Liu" suddenly recovered four and a half jiao, and the trend was chaotic. As a result, market prices mostly fell by two or three jiao to five or six jiao. "Bian Qian Cai Bing" (Troop Reduction) 20 rolls and "Zheng Liu" were still slightly better, with a turnover of between five fen and three and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated to be approximately 22.3 million yuan. The price fluctuations are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Abnormally Stagnant</h3>
<p>According to a report from SinFong &amp; Co., the New York stock market yesterday (the 25th) was abnormally stagnant due to the pending appointment of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Silver stocks were initially firm but then weakened. The silver futures market suddenly became active, possibly due to renewed government purchases. It is said that silver speculators are well aware that the silver futures market will soon come to an end, so they are mostly taking profits and closing out their transactions. The minor exchanges were stagnant but firm, and bonds did not fluctuate much. Most European bonds were stable. French 7.5% bonds were priced at around 185 yuan, the highest record in history. Wheat fell due to a bumper harvest. The total daily trading volume was 490,000 shares. Securities: Before the market close, it was heard that steel production had been sharply reduced, so the supply increased, and the market absorption was good. (Wheat) The influx of new wheat onto the market was unprecedented in recent times, and the market was frustrated. There is still a possibility of further declines, but it should be a good opportunity to buy. There was rain in several places, and the situation has not changed. People are optimistic. (Corn) The producing areas have received more rainfall, and there should be good buying opportunities this week. (Cotton) The market situation is firm due to hot weather in Texas, cotton damage, and increasing complaints from farmers. There is a lot of supply for the July term, but it is expected that bidders will be seen tomorrow. The main bulls for the July term seem to be completely satisfied. (Rubber) The market is stable. Major markets are unwilling to reduce supply at New York parity. The strike has not been resolved, but it is limited to the General Tire &amp; Rubber Company only. (Silver) Due to the swap of the July bulls, banks are unwilling to sell unless they have a satisfactory profit after removing the 5% tax, and the difference between the prices of the futures has widened. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flower Label Yarn Slightly Loosen</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the situation feels relatively stable, but sentiment is very good, and there are still many people who are long on dips, so the market is still rising. However, the price of Japanese yarn has fallen again by one or two yuan, resulting in the closing out of some long positions, and the market has loosened slightly. This month is the last day, and the closing price is 182.3 yuan, which is 7.5 yuan higher than the price in May.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster General Trend Still Flat</h3>
<p>At the opening of the label yarn market, the purchase wind was more intense in the market due to the rise of American cotton by 20 pounds.</p>
<p>Each month rose by one yuan to seven or eight jiao. After two or three auctions, the long positions that had profited closed out. As the price of Japanese yarn fell by one yuan, the market became weaker and weaker. As a result, this month rose by four jiao, and the far month fell by two or three jiao. The market situation was still weak in the afternoon, and the delivery price for this month was also flat. Each month fell by one, three, four, six, and eight jiao. The closing situation was slightly tight. The total daily transaction volume was 50,600 bales. It was found that Da Feng sold 1,150 bales, Sen Kang 2,450 bales, Yuan De 1,250 bales, Ren Feng 1,350 bales, Yi Yu 650 bales, Shen Ji 800 bales, and Xin Cheng 700 bales.

<p>Sichuan 200 Guangdong 150 Peer 170 Inland 347 Ningbo 65 Anqing 25</p>
<h3>Forward Flowers Are Relatively Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton market started flat and then rose. Due to the rise in American cotton, and the drought in this port, the new cotton crop has been damaged, so the forward situation is becoming more and more expensive. Speculators are also making large long positions, and the market situation is more expensive than old cotton. This month is the last day, and although the delivery is sufficient, the buyers are also prepared to receive the goods, so the market is relatively stable. The closing price is 45.8 yuan, which is 7 jiao higher than the price in May.</p>
<h3>Zheng Label Turns from Flat to High The label cotton market opened in the morning, rising along with American cotton</h3>
<p>One or two jiao. After two or three auctions, it fell back due to the sluggish yarn market, but the new cotton was firm due to the drought and dryness, and the new flowers were developing poorly. As a result, this month rose by one and a half jiao, the middle month was unchanged, and the far month rose by one and a half jiao. The opening was still flat in the afternoon, and it softened again after two or three auctions. The delivery price for this month was flat, and the far month suddenly tightened and rose at the closing. As a result, each month rose by one or two jiao. The total daily transaction volume was 114,600 dan. It was found that Chang Feng sold 8,500 dan, Yuan Tai 1,200 dan, Chun Ji 2,000 dan, Geng Feng 1,400 dan, Sen Kang 1,400 dan, Heng De 2,200 dan, Yi Cheng 1,700 dan, Da Chang 5,000 dan, and Chang He 2,500 dan.

<h3>Grain and Flour Futures Market Dynamism Is Surprisingly Strong</h3>
<p>As the Rumor of the Rise Due To</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month presented a chaotic rotation, with prices rising and falling at the same rate. At the time of opening, foreign wheat prices were quoted, Chicago fell by seven or eight jiao, and Canada fell by two or three jiao. The opening prices for this month to August fell by one fen, but from September onwards, due to unabated buying interest and rampant speculation, they did not fall but rather rose. Therefore, after the second auction, the opening price for this month immediately rose by two fen, and the situation became a short squeeze, reaching a maximum of 1 jiao and 8 fen. The prices for subsequent months also gradually increased, but by the third auction, the bulls poured out a lot of supply, both near and far, so sentiment turned weak and prices fell back very quickly. This kind of prosperity was entirely due to the demands and seizures of speculators, resulting in market prices rising and falling indefinitely. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, trading was still active, and the market was also good and bad. This month was raised to about eight fen again in the middle of the session, but later, due to the return of bulls, it fell to as little as six fen. The forward market was relatively stable, but the market situation was that most of the large bulls were local silver and money gangs, and the manipulation of the market in the future was still unavoidable, and the background was complicated, with little legitimate balance. As a result, this month fell by half a fen compared to the previous day's closing price, July fell by one fen, August fell by one fen and seven and a half li, September fell by one</p>
<p>Fen, October fell by one and a half fen, and November fell by half a fen.</p>
<p>Market rumors are currently that the high flour prices are caused by famines inside and outside the port, and also by the fact that large flour merchants have always been the main body of the bulls. Regardless of how actual sales are or how the wheat harvest is, they are buying step by step. It is said that the number of purchases by the silver and money gang has reached 3 million to 3.5 million bags (reaching the yarn, cloth, and securities gang). If they buy again, then two-thirds of the chips in the exchange will be in their hands. If this is the case, as the rumors say, then the steps of the market will be unreasonable.</p>
<h3>Near Rise Far Flat Period Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month presented a situation of near rise and far flat. Foreign wheat prices were quoted, Chicago fell by about seven or eight jiao, and Canada fell by two or three jiao, but due to the still dry weather and no rain, the price of inland wheat was also affected by speculation, and the price gradually increased, so the price of the wheat was still fierce after the price, and because of the delivery of this month, although the transaction was not much, it formed a short squeeze, and the closing opened to six jiao and four fen. From July onwards, off-site shorts entered one after another, and the market was good again. From July to October, it was good five, six, and seven fen, and November was flat. When the market opened in the afternoon, the initial price of this month was still strong, but later, due to the return of bulls, it suddenly fell sharply, and the difference between the opening and closing was as much as one jiao. The market atmosphere was also soft for the rest of the months, because the flour market turned loose, and the prices for each month fell back greatly compared to the morning. The final result was that this month still fell by six fen, July was slightly better by two fen, August was better by two fen, September and October were slightly smaller by one fen, and November was slightly smaller by five fen. In the physical wheat market, both arrivals and sales are booming, and the price of high-priced goods has been raised by three to five fen, while the middle and secondary levels are flat. The opening price of Bengbu wheat is 3.11 yuan per jiao, Mingguang Suqian wheat is 3.1 yuan to 1.2 fen per jiao, Pukou wheat is 2.87 yuan to 9.2 fen, Yaowan wheat is 3.1 yuan, and Daqiao Wuxi wheat is 3.05 yuan. Wuhu wheat is 2.92 yuan, followed by 8.8 fen to 8.3 fen, Danyang Taizhou wheat is 3 yuan, Nanjing wheat is 8.5 yuan, and the second grade is 8 jiao. Fuxin handles 24,000 bags, Huafeng handles 6,000 bags, and Xinda handles 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Rolled Back Yang Rice Rising Step by Step Outside the Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yang Kexian market situation, the local office of the foreign firms continued to be strong, because the weather was dry, people were optimistic, and the appetite of the Kexian gang was very greedy. This street's inland was also inquiring one after another, and there were hoarders active, and the market became more and more attractive. Yesterday, 2,671 bags of Xiang, Gan, and Wan rice were opened, and 6,000 bags of Hankou Shashi rough rice were opened. The market prices all rose by six or seven fen to one jiao compared to the previous day. Rolled back Yang rice opened 5,000 bags of Xiaojiao yesterday. The initial opening was 7.6 yuan, and it continued to rise to 7.67 yuan, which was 1 jiao and 2 fen higher than the previous market. It was divided by the inland Beiyang and Fuzhou in this street. Yang rice also had hoarders inquiring, because although the current market price has risen, it is still lower than the previous market price, and some people are</p>
<p>Optimistic to 8 yuan,</p>
<h3>Hexia Rice Market Chaotic</h3>
<p>(Hunan) Each gang has a source of thirty-odd numbers (nearly 5,000 shi of goods in total)</p>
<p>After yesterday's sharp rise, the sales of late rice in the market became more sluggish. The communal office only had five or six hundred bags of Qingjiao Songjiang and other goods. The market situation felt relatively quiet, but the market price was still firm because of the extraordinarily dry weather and people's confidence. There is still hope for a continued rise of several points. Each gang's thick japonica rice shop's sentiment is unstable, so although there is not much appetite, they are always upward, such as the usual price increase of Su Tong Nanhai and other goods. However, the price of Du Yangjian, because the side doors have no importance, is still the same.</p>
<p>(Hubbei) Yesterday, each road in Hexia had six or seven sources, and there were only ninety ships in Hexia. Although the sales of each commodity in the market were sluggish, the merchants' hearts were firm, and the market price of Gaobai japonica rice rose by two or three jiao, and the price of thin rice Baiyuan Dujian rice rose by one or two jiao, and the price of Yang Kejian rice rose by several fen to near jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sliced Green Plummets Seven Jiao</h3>
<p>▲Prevent Deterioration Due to Hot Weather: Reluctantly Cut Out 500+ Boxes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was disturbed by the step-down of Customs Gold and the news of a tax reduction, which may be implemented. People were panicked, and the market was in chaos. The price list of the association, such as No. 24 coarse sand white bargaining for 20 yuan, had few buyers. Taikoo B mark shouted 20 yuan and 4 jiao, but none were made. The price of No. 1 cotton white in this factory was 18.9 yuan, a decrease of 1 jiao, and scattered transactions were made. Huizhou White continued to open more than 300 bags, priced at 17 yuan to 16.8 yuan. The former number of Beihai sliced green sugar had thousands of boxes in stock, all pulled back and not sold. However, as the weather was hot and long storage would prevent deterioration, they had to reluctantly cut out 500+ boxes yesterday, priced at 11.1 yuan, a plummet of 7 jiao compared to before.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Zhejiang Summer Cocoons Will Be on the Market Shanghai Silk Factories are Starting Work One After Another</h3>
<p>(Wuxing Summer Silkworms Can Be Expected to Have a Bumper Harvest) Farmers in various cities and towns in Wuxing have raised improved species this spring. Although the price of spring cocoons was small and resulted in losses, a considerable amount of local species remain. They raise summer silkworms to make up for the shortage of local silk raw materials. The weather is warm, and the silkworm eggs are developing smoothly. The early groups of silkworms have three molts and sufficient leaves. If the weather does not change, then the summer cocoons can be expected to have a bumper harvest.</p>
<p>(Five More Silk Factories Have Started Their Machines) The number of dry spring cocoons transported to Shanghai from Jiangsu and Zhejiang is increasing day by day. The cocoons are thick and the reeling rate is not high. The rent for reeling silk machines in silk factories used to be 3 taels of silver per unit, but this year it is only one foreign yuan. Therefore, silk cocoon merchants are renting factories to reel silk one after another. In addition to the 25 factories that have already started work, such as Fengtai, five factories in the American Concession, A.B.C. Latorro, Yuanyuan, and Zhabei Meifeng, have also started their machines one after another. More than a dozen factories may also start working in early next month.</p>
<p>(American Sales of Chinese Silk Are Increasingly Lifeless) The weather in New York is hot, and American silk weaving factories are preparing to take summer vacations early. There is still a lot of silk in stock, and demand is increasingly low. The sales of Chinese silk in the United States are increasingly lifeless. European companies are also approaching the semi-annual closing period, and current silk imports are increasingly light. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others imported 16 packages of yellow and white coarse silk, and the price is still weakening.</p>
<h3>Shrimp Eye Pearl Tea French Sales are Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign company tea market in this port, the French sales of shrimp eye pearl tea from the Pingshui Road and local company tea houses were already active. Yongxing, Du Dejinlong, Tongfu, and other firms were searching for tea and making transactions due to foreign telegrams requesting it, and the market was not lonely. The top-quality Huizhou tea was sold at 112 yuan, and the rest did not fluctuate much compared to before. The American company is still searching for large gangs of green tea from Pingshui, and the Lu Zhuang Zhenmei are also sold as soon as they arrive. The market price of tea from Suian Zhuang has already rebounded by four or five yuan. The British and Russian companies are still畅达selling red tea from Qi and Hunan, and the market is consistently firm. The trend of the tea market is becoming more and more stable.</p>
<h3>Oil Market White Tung Oil Han Market Turns Up</h3>
<p>White tung oil initially experienced a gradual decline due to the closure of foreign firms in Hankou, lasting for about two weeks, dropping from 30.04 yuan to 28 yuan. However, the low price naturally stimulated buying interest. According to recent foreign firms' completion of 200-300 tons, the price has repeatedly increased from 18.1 yuan to 28.6 yuan. The speed of the market turnaround is truly elusive, with a rapid thousand changes. In short, this year cannot be compared to previous years, because the production has been greatly reduced, so the foreign company market price of 27-28 yuan can be considered the lowest limit. If it is above 30 yuan, it will naturally be stagnant. This is also due to the times. As the Han price has turned around, the Zhejiang tung oil has also echoed it. According to a telegram from Lanxi yesterday, it has been increased to 25.8 yuan per dan, which is an increase of seven or eight jiao compared to before. The stock of the local firm is not thick, so they are full of hope for a slight recovery, and they are continuously importing to thicken the bottom, but once the market situation changes, then what is hoped for becomes a pie in the sky. Fortunately, sales have not moved, and it is still possible to take it easy and plan.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Golden Needle Vegetables New Goods Will Arrive</h3>
<p>Because the sales of golden needle vegetables are smooth, the old goods on the market have been sold out. According to a letter from Hankou, the new Zhengzhou golden vegetables have already entered the market and can be shipped to Shanghai in about ten days. According to the industry's speculation, at a time when various gangs are in great need, the expected selling price will be around 25-26 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware Tinplate Sales Sharply Reduced</h3>
<p>Tinplate sales have been decreasing in recent years. This is because tobacco companies, printing factories, and can factories have sharply reduced their appetite due to mold. Also, hot water bottle factories and bamboo shoot factories are in the off-season and no one is inquiring. Export business is even more difficult to predict, so the market situation is completely stagnant. Although various industries are trying their best to maintain it, but due to the bad environment, the actual sales cannot afford it. The current market price can still be maintained because the set price is gradually increasing. For example, the American 90-pound goods sell for 15.75 yuan per box, and the 100-pound goods are estimated at 16.5 yuan. The double-linked goods are 32 yuan for 90 pounds and 34 yuan for 100 pounds. The German 90-pound goods sell for 15 yuan, and the 100-pound goods are estimated at 16 yuan. The double-linked 90-pound goods sell for 30.05 yuan, and the 100-pound goods sell for 32.75 yuan. The British and French goods are all out of stock, so there is no market to record.</p>

<h3>Speculation and Knowing the Times</h3>
<p>— Cen Lou</p>
<p>Speculation is the worst of nouns. Speculators are often looked down upon. For example, political speculation makes one a politician. Politicians are the people most deeply loathed by the general public. Besides politics, there are also many speculators in business and society. Especially in business, generally those who live by speculation can hardly do any business without it. This is another matter. As for speculation in society, it is generally not easy to discern. If the social trend leans to the right, they also lean to the right; if it leans to the left, they also lean to the left. They don't care whether it's left or right, as long as it benefits them personally, they can "trim their sails to the wind" at any time. This is a type of social speculation. This is speaking from a fundamental perspective. As for other minor matters, people generally hold very strong speculative tendencies. For example, if studying international affairs is popular today, they will become experts in international issues. Similarly, if studying China is popular tomorrow, they can immediately become experts in Chinese issues. How much research do they actually have on international or Chinese affairs? In reality, it is all superficial; what they know is just the tip of the iceberg. Yet, they always claim to be experts in international or Chinese issues. Why is this? It is to use this as a means to deceive for money and food. Deceiving for money and food is the sole root cause of their speculation. The original purpose of speculation is nothing more than to deceive for money and food. This is the reason why they speculate. Furthermore, there are many instances of speculation in society; we can encounter them everywhere if we pay attention. In short, speculation is the bone marrow of this society. Without speculation, there is no way to make a living. Thus, speculation is particularly prevalent in this society.</p>
<p>However, alongside speculation, there is also "knowing the times." How should this be explained? What is the difference between the two? Speculation is extremely bad, but at the same time, knowing the times is very good. As the ancients said, those who understand the times are heroes.</p>
<p>What exactly are the differences between knowing the times and speculation? This is a very interesting question.</p>
<p>In my opinion, these two are not difficult to explain. One is for private gain, while the other, in addition to personal gain, also understands society. For example, the highest goal of speculation is, at most, to create a position for oneself to live a better life. However, knowing the times is different. Its goal is not to increase personal status, but rather to understand society, to know the general trend of society, to clearly see the inevitable path of historical evolution, and thus to devote oneself to society, following this historical trend, and to move forward. This is true knowing the times. The difference between knowing the times and speculation lies in this point. The difference between the two is whether they understand society or are only for personal gain. Although the directions they take are different, their behaviors are somewhat similar. A slight deviation can lead to a great difference. We must make a serious distinction in this regard.</p>
<p>Speculation is decadent. Only a decadent society will produce speculative activities. "Knowing the times," on the other hand, is progressive. In this turbulent society, everyone should have the ability to know the times. Knowing the times can guide you forward. Only knowing the times can help you recognize the right path. We need to know the times, and at the same time, we must seriously combat speculation. Speculation can lead to decline. Young people should recognize what our proper path is. Don't be afraid of the trials of history. Every brave and promising young person should advance with the trend of the times and constantly move forward.</p>
<h3>The Women's Kingdom of Yancheng</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kan</p>
<p>Because of the inconvenience of transportation in our country, many strange things are buried and unheard of, which is a great pity. Last month, my friend Mr. Tang Hai'an went to Yancheng on business and took the opportunity to visit the seaside. Unexpectedly, he discovered the strange story of the Women's Kingdom from the people of the seaside. Yesterday, Mr. Tang returned to Shanghai and told me in detail with great interest. Without presuming on my own limited knowledge, I will summarize it as follows:</p>
<p>Location: Although Yancheng is a city by the Yellow Sea, it is actually more than two hundred li away from the sea. To the north is the Xinyang Port, and to the south is the Doulong Port. These two ports are very important to the fishing industry of our country. When the fishing season ends in autumn, and the fishing boats return, the area of several tens of li between the two ports is simply completely occupied by fishing boats. Half of the people in Yancheng work in salt production, and half work in fishing. They are all willing to work hard, so there is no worry about food and clothing. Near the Xinyang Port, there is a small town with a circumference of ten li. This small town is called Huachuan Port, which is also the Women's Kingdom that we are going to talk about today. Naming: How did this Huachuan Port come to be called the Women's Kingdom? The reason is that transportation from Yancheng to the seaside is too inconvenient. Besides small carts, there is nothing else that can be used as a means of transportation. Its speed is very slow. In fact, a long journey of more than one hundred li cannot be pushed in one day. However, except for the eastern gate and the northern gate's suburbs, which have a few residences, the rest is all uninhabited. If you can't push it halfway, there will be a great danger. The people living in Huachuan Port rely entirely on fishing for a living. When the yellow croaker fishing season arrives, every man over the age of ten in each household has to go south on a boat to catch fish in places like Hupu and Liuhe, until the ninth or tenth lunar month before returning. During these six months, only women are left to guard the homes in the town of Huachuan Port, and it has become a strange Women's Kingdom!</p>
<p>History: About two hundred years ago, there was no small town by the Xinyang Port. Because transportation was too inconvenient, the families of these fishermen felt very difficult living in the city. So, a group of fishermen started building houses by the sea, starting with only thirty or forty households. Later, they gradually multiplied, and now there are nearly a thousand households. Thus, it was named Huachuan Port. Gradually separated from Yancheng, it became like Taoyuan in Wuling. Moreover, the sons and daughters there do not marry people from other places.</p>
<p>Politics: There is no talk of politics or law there. But if you talk about autonomy? There is no such organization. The establishment of a police station or a security group is even more out of the question. If they encounter pirates looting, the whole village will bravely resist with weapons, regardless of death. So, pirates dare not harbor covetous thoughts or visit their town. Because life there is simple, there is no talk of science, and there is no education, so the people are much more innocent than people in other places! Disputes and fights rarely occur. If there is any case, it is ultimately in the Fishing Guild Hall of the town! It is the highest body where meetings are held for discussion!! Fair mediation, and both parties are willing to listen and resolve.</p>
<p>Expenditure: Although there is not a single well-equipped shop in this small town, the embroidery rooms are decorated in an unusually splendid and magnificent manner. And all kinds of famous cosmetics, such as baby face cream, star soap, perfume essence, moon palace powder, etc., are readily available. Originally, these things were brought back by their husbands from other places when they sailed south. However, their expenses in the town are very small. Only on the birthdays in the first lunar month and the Earth Queen Goddess's birthday in the second lunar month do they hire opera troupes to perform several plays, and the whole town entertains themselves madly for a day, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Mystery: The women there are not only all in trendy hairstyles, but they are also pleasing to the eye. After their husbands go on the boats, for half a year, it is entirely a women's kingdom. How can they not be moved by the flowers before the moon? Who can dispel the loneliness of empty beds? Therefore, the poor bachelors of the proletariat in the city are more daring to go to Huachuan Port. Not only can they get the preferential treatment of fine clothes and delicacies, but also the enjoyment of flesh. During this period, if a man goes there, they are one hundred and twenty-four percent welcome, and it is simply a case of a hundred women fighting for a husband. Until their husbands are about to return by boat, those playboys are driven out and scattered.</p>
<h3>Monks in the City</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>When I moved here, what caught my attention and surprised me the most was the ancient nunnery on the left and the dance hall across the street, standing in opposition to each other, a scene that was thought-provoking. But after all, I am a careless and impetuous person, and after taking a glance, I didn't give it any thought. If things hadn't erupted so quickly, if Aunt Kui hadn't told me in such fascinating detail, I would still be "completely ignorant." The general story is like this:</p>
<p>In this ancient nunnery, there are a full dozen monks living by begging, and they are all grown men. Perhaps because they usually have enough vegetarian food and don't worry much about worldly affairs, they are all fat and fair-skinned, and the short ones look like winter melons.</p>
<p>Among them, there is a monk named Jueren, who is said to be the leader of the monks. He seems to be very busy every day. If someone asks him why he is so busy, he has many reasons to explain. I have also met him once or twice. He is a short man, about thirty years old, and his rolling eyes are the most noticeable and suspicious. He likes to talk about doctrines and tell jokes. What makes me a little dissatisfied is that he once tried to persuade me to become his disciple. I asked if I could bring my wife and children, and he asked if I had a wife at such a young age? Then he turned his head and sighed deeply. I have been a little unhappy with him since then, and our interactions have been intermittent.</p>
<p>He has a young Chan wife, but very few people know that he has this trick. His secret skills are very deep. She often pretends to come to the nunnery to offer incense, but in fact, she is looking for him to pour out her feelings. The other monks don't understand much. As for him going out to meet his lover, no one knows about it.</p>
<p>It is said that there was only one time when the news almost leaked. This is a natural principle. If a monk has a Chan wife, he will inevitably have children. One day, his son came to the nunnery to visit his father. The other monks all stared at him. Fortunately, he turned things around quickly, saying that he was an adopted son, and he got through it safely.</p>
<p>I don't know when, his Chan wife fell ill and passed away, parting ways with him forever. It was truly a case of losing a spouse in middle age, which is extremely painful. He was of course very sad, but he had no place to turn to vent his suffering, so he had to swallow his tears.</p>
<p>Recently, Monk Jueren has been slightly comforted. There is proof that he suddenly became particular about his kasaya.</p>
<p>He often said with a smile that the kasaya must be made of that kind of material and cut in that way. Someone even saw him wearing ordinary people's beautiful clothes outside, but he absolutely denied it, saying that bad people were deliberately slandering him and maliciously damaging his reputation.</p>
<p>One evening last week, someone saw him slip into the door of the dance hall across the street. This news spread to the nunnery, and everyone's eyebrows shot up, feeling that it was a serious disaster. But he slowly strolled back and reprimanded the monks without caring, much like Zilu swearing to his students after Confucius met Nanzi. However, things were eventually exposed. Monk Jueren did go to the dance hall across the street, but whether he danced with the dancers is unknown. According to the accountant in the dance hall, he only went there to ask if there was a dancer named Pei, and he didn't go upstairs.</p>
<p>Now, the fact is that he is about to marry a widow surnamed Lin. This news has simply spread far and wide, and all his acquaintances know about it. At this point, he himself had nothing more to say. He told some of his disciples that he was going to move to another nunnery, first taking away part of the property. The monks all refused outright, only allowing him to move his luggage. Unexpectedly, as soon as he moved out the door, he was surrounded by a group of unsavory people and beaten badly. His bedding was also snatched away, and he was seriously injured.</p>
<p>The aftermath is not known in detail.</p>
<h3>Getting Rich</h3>
<p>— Ma Ying</p>
<p>Afa was an honest man who only knew how to work hard in the fields and never thought about how to get rich. The villagers all praised him for being capable, but Afa never showed any pride.</p>
<p>However, for several years in a row, there was no good harvest. Floods, droughts, soldiers, bandits, and exorbitant taxes besieged the countryside on seven or eight fronts. Under these circumstances, the countryside went bankrupt.</p>
<p>The old people grumbled all day long. The young people silently ran to the cities.</p>
<p>Under this misfortune, Afa was already deeply in debt. The thought that had never occurred to him before struck his heart for the first time! How to make a fortune, pay off this debt, and save these old and young people?</p>
<p>He finally found an opportunity on the first day that the aviation lottery was sold in this village. Afa borrowed a dollar from someone to buy one. Although the day of the lottery drawing was still far away, he felt unprecedentedly happy, as if the first prize was his even before the drawing.</p>
<p>The child started crying, and Afa went over to hug him, kissing his thin cheek, and said, "Don't cry! In another month, Dad will win the lottery, lots of money, and buy candy."</p>
<p>The old man and his wife didn't approve, but Afa didn't care. He patiently waited, waiting for the day Afa was looking forward to, finally came, and passed. Afa fell into the abyss of disappointment. The old man was so angry that his face turned purple, and he babbled:</p>
<p>"Want to get rich! Wasted a dollar, and have to add interest..."</p>
<p>"Damn it!"</p>
<p>Afa tore the aviation lottery ticket in two and threw it on the ground, stamping on it angrily.</p>
<p>The child ran in from outside, picked up the two pieces of colorful paper, looked at Afa, and shouted, "Dad, money, buy candy."</p>
<p>"Fuck your mother!"</p>
<p>He kicked the child away and rushed out the door.</p>

<h3>Going Down the Well</h3>
<p>— Meng Jun</p>
<p>One of the Miscellanies of Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>The summer in Northern Jiangsu is really a bit scaryly hot. If I may say so, I must say that Northern Jiangsu possesses another sun. In spring, it seems not too dissimilar to the sun south of the Yangtze, but come summer, the situation is altogether different. Virtually every day, from the moment it reveals itself in the morning until it sets in the afternoon, it unleashes the highest degree of heat within its power upon the earth. That place is a bit distant from the ocean, so no oceanic climate can reach it to temper the parched air. Nor are there lofty mountains that can slightly block the heat of this second sun, nor any great rivers like the Yangtze to moisten this arid soil. Northern Jiangsu is not bad in all other respects, but it is because of the lack of the aforementioned that summer is truly frightful. I remember that when I spent my first summer in Northern Jiangsu, I really couldn't stand the scorching heat, so I once hid in a dry well for ten full minutes. At that time, I can no longer clearly remember what motivated me to do this, but I will not forget the situation in the well and the method of going down the well. The method of going down the well is very simple: a thick rope and a wooden bucket. But when going down, it was not that I called many people to pull the rope and I sat in the bucket to be lowered slowly, but rather that I, alone on the wellhead, first fastened the rope to the roots of a tree, put a bucket into the well at one end, and then hung a flashlight on my own head, the flashlight head pointing down, pressed on. Both hands first grabbed the rope at the wellhead, and then both feet stretched into the well, and then one hand replaced the other to descend. At this time, even though the rope was not as hard as a lever, because of the descending momentum, it was much easier and steadier, and my chest was hung with a lit flashlight. One hand after another descended, and finally reached the place where the wooden bucket was tied. I did not count how many hands were changed when descending from the wellhead to the bucket, otherwise, I would have remembered it firmly, but anyway, this rope hung in the well was probably three zhang.</p>
<p>At that time, the hour was not noon, the sun was slightly westward, so the well was unusually dark, and everything in the well had to be illuminated with a flashlight. When I shined the flashlight down, I realized that the wooden bucket I was sitting on was still about three or four zhang from the bottom of the well. The bottom of the well was full of weeds that could not be named, but there were indeed a lot of discarded objects thrown down, and the surroundings of the well were covered with moss. Apart from these things, I could not find any other strange things. I looked up and immediately felt as if I was drilling in a telescope, because looking out from a wellhead three feet away from me, I saw the clouds in the sky, and the contours of each cloud were unusually clear.</p>
<p>The temperature in the well, I can say was chillingly cold, but what made me unable to endure it any longer was a thick smell in the well. I could hardly describe what kind of smell it was, but I believed that this smell must be comparable to the smell in a dug-up tomb. At that time, I was not intending to stay in the well for a longer time, but this smell did not allow me to do so, so I stood up and grabbed the rope to ascend. This time it was not as easy as when I came down. Although the light was shining down from above, and I had previously moved the flashlight head up with a rope and pressed it on my chest, and the rope could be seen very clearly to avoid losing my grip, but the soft rope, as I pulled it up with my hand, would shake, and this was the easiest way to lose my grip. At this time, I felt a little dangerous, but there was no way, I had to climb up. Truly thanking God for his blessing, my hands did not slip, and the strength in my arms also kept up, so I managed to climb out of the well, but my body was covered in sweat.</p>
<h3>About "Crying for Relatives"</h3>
<p>— Guangyu</p>
<p>In the place of M County, there is a strange and peculiar custom. Whenever a girl who has been betrothed to a man learns of the death of her fiancé's father or mother, she must wear mourning clothes and rush to her fiancé's home to cry bitterly at the ancestral tablet of her nominal father-in-law or mother-in-law. This is done to express her filial piety towards her father-in-law or mother-in-law, with whom she had no relationship during their lifetime. This is what is called "crying for relatives."</p>
<p>This is undeniable. A person who has no emotional connection with oneself during their lifetime dies, and one is asked to sympathize with them, or even to mourn them bitterly. This is a very unnatural act that damages one's will!! Otherwise, unless the deceased is someone who had a close relationship with oneself during their lifetime.</p>
<p>A nominal daughter-in-law who has not yet married her son basically lacks the opportunity to develop emotions with oneself. Now, because of one's own death, she is forced to feel sympathy for oneself. If sympathy is not enough, she is asked to cry bitterly for oneself, which is even more absurd and unreasonable.</p>
<p>In the place of M County, usually when an old man or old woman dies, if this old man or old woman has a son, someone will ask with concern, "Has the deceased's son been betrothed?" If the deceased's son has a fiancée, then the person gossiping will show an envious look on his face and say, "Such a death is not considered lonely. He has a daughter-in-law to 'cry for relatives'!" On the contrary, if he is answered, "The deceased's son has not been betrothed," then the person asking will immediately lower his face, sigh, and say, "The deceased lived a life in vain. At the last moment, he didn't even have a daughter-in-law to 'cry for relatives,' which is so unfortunate!"</p>
<p>From this phenomenon, it can be seen that "crying for relatives" occupies a special force in the place of M County.</p>
<p>Even stranger, girls in their virgin years are usually very shy. But girls who grow up in M County have long regarded "crying for relatives" as even more sincere than the edict of emperors in the autocratic era. So, the girls who are "crying for relatives" in person can temporarily put aside their inherent shyness and naturally sympathize with their father-in-law or mother-in-law, with whom they had no emotional connection during their lifetime, and cry bitterly at the ancestral tablet of their father-in-law or mother-in-law, and can cry out a lot of tones that make people feel sore. As for the girls who are in the position of onlookers, when they find out that someone has died somewhere and someone is "crying for relatives," it goes without saying that they will definitely invite their older sisters and younger sisters to come "from thousands of miles away" to see what is going on. Moreover, after they have seen it, they can comment on the strengths and weaknesses on the way back. Like that girl's posture is not good, the tone is acceptable, the voice is not bad: etc. are all possible. Sometimes, when they are happy, they will even cry and play with what they just heard! Isn't this a strange thing?</p>
<p>I have been to M County and have also seen the so-called "crying for relatives" farce with my own eyes. I think this is a social problem worth discussing in a society that is expanding the voice of women's rights!!</p>

<h3>Unable to Endure Days of Humiliation and Scolding</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>At the age of nine, my parents took me to school to receive education. In the spring of my tenth year, my mother fell ill, and in less than a month, she passed away! In the autumn, my father, considering that I was still a young child, married a second mother to take care of my hunger, warmth, and well-being. After my father went away to do business, only she and I were at home. Following her orders, I had to do all the household chores that I was capable of doing before I could go to study. Otherwise, I would be met with scornful glances and scolding, and sometimes she would even threaten to beat me. Although I was nominally enrolled in school, in reality, I only had time to study for half of each month. When my father returned, she would tell him that I was only interested in playing and refused to study. Later, after studying for seven years, my father saw that I was getting older and not making progress in my studies. Moreover, due to the poor financial situation of the family, he asked a friend to recommend me to a factory in this city. I became a factory apprentice without a teacher. Six years have passed now, and I haven't been home once. Unexpectedly, last autumn, the factory manager of our factory was replaced, and there was no director in my department. The factory manager directly managed it. I now earn six dollars a month, and my life is extremely miserable. Now I have to go to work at 5:30 every morning. Due to the need to eat and economic pressure, there is naturally no way to think about it. However, if I do something slightly wrong now, the factory manager starts scolding, even mentioning my deceased mother in the underworld. I am working alone in the factory. Seventy percent of the three hundred workers and staff in the entire factory were introduced by him. Therefore, I am helpless against his humiliation and scolding. My mother has already passed away, so why should she also be scolded by him? Therefore, my heart is restless day and night. I want to ask a friend to introduce me to another job, but due to the bad economic situation, the number of unemployed workers is increasing day by day, which is also difficult. If I go back home, I will have no face to see my father, my current mother, and the neighbors. Furthermore, my father is unemployed, and the family is destitute. He definitely cannot allow me to sit and eat without working. As for other jobs, I have no skills at all and cannot do them. I can no longer endure these days of humiliation and scolding, so I am in a dilemma. I am afraid that only the Huangpu River is the place for me to settle down. Dear sir, perhaps you can solve my problem. I am praying and waiting for your reply to this request. Wishing you peace and brilliant insights.</p>
<p>Jin Yuhao</p>
<p>Answer: We must respect our own personality, and we should not be too casual with the impolite insults of others, nor should we simply swallow our anger and remain silent. We should actively resist. However, when we are insulted, we should first reflect on whether this insult is truly an insult to you, and whether this insult is "self-inflicted." Only if it is not "self-inflicted" and is truly an insult should we protest. If it is not so, and we still feel indignant and protest fiercely, it is meaningless. Of course, your factory manager's scolding of you is indeed an insult. But including your mother in his insults is base and vile, and he has already lost his own dignity. This is simply like the barking of a mad dog. We don't need to pay attention to such people at all. You only need to carefully reflect on yourself and see if there is any "self-inflicted" element in it. If so, then be more cautious in the future so that he has nothing to say. If not, then you can ignore it, because this is his own loss of dignity and cannot be considered your shame.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if you want to resist such insults, it should be done by all the workers. How can you resist the factory manager alone? To do so would be foolish. The factory manager's impolite scolding of you, and your inability to resist due to being isolated and weak, are not your personal shame, but the shame of the entire working class. All the workers in your factory, in order to maintain the status and dignity of the workers, must protest in the name of all the workers. Because this is not only to stand up for you personally, but also not an act of chivalry, but to ensure that the factory manager does not oppress workers by using his power and position. You must use all your strength to resist. After you understand this, you should quickly dispel the thought that "only the Huangpu River is the place for you to settle down," and you should not think of it as a personal matter and seek a solution from a personal perspective.

<h3>The Chaste Widow's Arch (12)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>One late spring evening, the cat on the roof was meowing annoyingly. She lay in bed, quietly opening her eyes. The surroundings of the house were as frightening as a tomb. The warm wind outside the window opened a paper window for no reason, and the vague white light of the moon poured in from there, drifting in the spring breeze, like a light veil, softly caressing her chest, making her breathing feel urgent. She struggled in bed. But the bed was also so wide and empty. But when she touched part of her son's body, she felt protected. At the same time, she also felt a mysterious force that made her heart beat even more terrifyingly. She realized that the person sleeping at her feet was her son. He had returned from his uncle's place and was already fast asleep. And it immediately made her think that her young and handsome uncle was probably already asleep too. But was he really asleep? As soon as she thought of this, the hand of her deceased husband gnawed at her heart, making her feel very painful, almost as if it was about to break. So she struggled. She bravely sat up and got out of bed. She walked to the window, holding her chest. A warm breeze brushed her face, intoxicating her and making her sink back into the chair at the dressing table. Lazily, she picked up a bronze mirror and, in the vague moonlight, she looked at the two tear stains on her face. But the boiling blood still could not calm her down, especially since the thick scent of roses kept flowing in from outside the window. Although she knew very well that she was a widow who had been chaste for more than ten years, the iron chain that maintained the belief of being a widow had already been broken by her surging blood. So she ignored the image of her husband flashing before her eyes. She put on her clothes and ran to her uncle's place, pushing open the door that had not been opened once all year round, and walked to his door, knocking. Her leaping heart was almost jumping out of her throat.</p>
