<p>時評</p>
<h3>論英美聯合制日敬</h3>
<p>日本藉維持和平之名。以圖獨覇遠東之實。首當其衝者。自爲我國。然其影響所及。英國市塲。亦根本發生摇動。不得不將其以往經營之事業範圍。漸次縮小。美國之於遠東。本有經濟開拓之宏顧。然自九一八事變後。其所主張之門户開放主義。機會均等主義。亦已爲日人之閉門主義。獨占主義所瓜代。日本運用地理。上之優勢。倚賴軍備上之實力。得寸進尺。其欲甚奢。今滿熱旣得。復欲染指華北。英美兩國。皆以陷於形勢。未敢實力干涉。故英美聯合制日之醖釀。雖早有傳聞。而其輪廓尚在海縮會議預備談話停頓以後。始漸趨明顯。而此事之實現可能性何如。猶待將來而始得見也。</p>
<p>兹先分析一般形勢。用以闡明英美對日之關係。日本以一手破壞國際信義。撕毁華盛頓公約及非戰公約。已爲世人所共知。然其先英國卸責於國際聯盟。美國則受制於復興運動。互相觀望。不欲强硬主張。於是日人乃更利用局部之優越地位。以企圖遠東之整個獨占。迨日人之計劃逐步實現。英美兩國始發生恐慌。亟謀聯合。以挽回頽勢。此其一。日本政府近年來高唱「非常時」之論調。一面盡力增加軍事預算。發展與軍事有關之各項工業。一面更努力向海外開闢市塲。實行社會的傾銷政策。舉凡香港·新嘉坡·以及印度·南非·埃及歐澳·加拿大·南美諸國。一般感受日貨傾銷影響。英國縱老於經商。對此新進之勁敵。亦痛感應付之困難。結果乃不能不思聯合美國以制止之。此其二。在一九三六年倫敦海軍條約滿期之前。軍縮問題自應預籌解决之道。英美雙方對於技術的討論。雖各持成見。然其主張在將來會議席上加入政治問題。則頗爲一致。惟日本對此。堅持異議。良以不談政治問題。則滿案醜史以及南洋代管羣島。皆可無須注意。不特此也。日本更提出平等比率之說。以期擴大其實力。以日人態度之强硬。推測菲利濱獨立後之命運。已可悲觀。至於關島彈丸之地。更何足當日人之一擊。卽令美國海軍能退守夏威夷。以鞏固其西方門户。究竟不免後人一着矣。是以美國亦亟欲與英聯合。勉力支持太平洋上之均勢。此其三。且英美有同文同種之歷史關係。英國之自治殖民地。對美尤具好感。二國鑒於今後之危機。回思往昔之交誼。實行在遠東携手。非不可能。此其四。</p>
<p>顧今日之先進國家。多以資本主義爲基礎。而資本主義之發達。必趨向主们獨占。英美兩國向爲個中之巨擘。而而雄不並立。則時勢使然。大戰而後。金圓勢力支配世界。英國不得已而退處於第二位。但自一九二九年經濟恐慌發生以還。美國受生産過剩之影響。亦竟盛極而衰。降至最近。尚未能澈底恢復。反之。英帝國内之經濟聯盟運動。則逐漸見效。對外之市塲爭奪。亦異常激烈。不肯讓步。卽如在南美一隅。英美二國皆在促進其經濟實力之膨脹。其於交通·投資·及一般産業。均以　獨占爲標的。此外如石油競爭。無論爲産地之開發。或市塲之分割。皆絶少調和餘地。是以由資本主義國家之立國精神以觀察。吾人又不能不感覺。英美聯合一事。在理論上縱有可能。在實際利害上尚多窒碍。日本如利用此種弱點。設法離問兩國對日之聯合陣綫。則前途之形勢仍未可知也。</p>

<h3>癰養適足遺患</h3>
<p>英自由黨領袖觀測</p>
<p>大戰發動在十年後</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國自由黨領袖勞合喬治今日對巴黎微言報記者稱、渠願担保各國無須以十年内再有一次大戰爲慮、德國目前未能作戰、今雖有爲戰爭所必要之心理狀况、但物質事實、亦必須考慮及之、大戰時渠爲英政府首相、故渠深知作戰之不易云、喬治又稱、列强聽令日本在滿洲爲其所欲爲、適鼓勵日耳曼黷武主義云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>日本注視</p>
<h3>東歐公約進展</h3>
<p>（東京）以俄法英爲中心、以保障波羅的各國之安全、與以援助爲目的之東方洛迦羅條約、其訂立工作現有進步、此約在維持歐洲現狀惟德國對此、究採如何態度、殊堪注目、至日本之見解、以此約内容規定締約國受他國攻擊時、他之條約國於國聯規定之範圍内、與以援助、此點視德國之出手如何、其成否頗爲疑問、成立之際、蘇聯於西部國境得到安全保障、或向遠東國境採積極行動、故外務省對此、加以監視、（七日電通電）</p>
<p>日本軍部積極主張</p>
<h3>鞏固對僞國之控制</h3>
<p>外交行政歸駐滿大使</p>
<p>僞國與關東不啻合併</p>
<p>（東京）陸軍當局關於改革駐滿機關之具體辦法如次、</p>
<p>（一）駐滿機關基礎、以全權大使及軍司令官之二位爲一體廢除關東長官、新設關東州知事、專任關東州内行政事務、</p>
<p>（二）全權大使置於總理大臣之下、外務大臣監督外交事項、其他警察權及課稅權等行政事項、盡歸全權大使管屬、大使館内設事務總廳·警察部·外事部監督部（監督關東州知事及滿鐵公司）實行外交行政事務、</p>
<p>（三）爲實現日滿經濟聯盟起見、新設經濟會議、研究各種具體案、由總理大臣監督其實行事務、</p>
<p>（四）將來治外法權撤廢時、改稱憲兵司令官名稱、</p>
<p>（五）拓務省廢止問題、不堅主張、但拓務省之對滿發言權、自然取消、（七日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於改革在滿行政機關之陸軍案谷參事官携來之現地案、與對滿政策遂行上、希望以何等形式保有發言權之拓務省案、内容均有不同、而調整此三案間之外務省案、其所主張爲漸進的改革、蓋以不毁損「滿洲國」獨立爲最大眼目而立案者、卽原則的對陸軍案表示贊成之意、然對行政機關之機搆體身、則持異論如下、</p>
<p>（一）置關東州於駐滿太使權限之下、是將本國領土内之行政權一併交與派往獨立國之大使、則「滿洲國」之獨立根本已不存在、故不可由拓務省之手奪去向滿洲問題之發言權與行政權、應將關東州歸拓相管轄、由駐滿大使之管轄獨立、承認拓務省之管轄權、方爲妥當、</p>
<p>（二）陸軍案之駐滿大使、關於外交行政承認首相與外相之二重監督、然大使之行政權爲暫定的、將來外交機關必到純化之運命、故此項監督應爲外務省之一元的、（七日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）與在滿機搆之改革問題相關、拓務省之廢止亦成爲問題、惟陸軍首腦部之見解、謂滿洲非殖民地、乃獨立國家、故以拓務省本務之拓殖的方針而臨「滿洲國」絶對不可、且滿鐵其他在滿特殊公司爲帝國對滿發展之實體、若其統制監督歸拓務省一省管理、則從滿洲問題之重大性日滿議定書之精神及日滿關係之特殊性觀之、均爲不可、故由此意義主張拓務省中止其對滿洲之一頭的監督統制、而移歸總理大臣、結果拓務省是否廢止、與陸軍完全無關、（七日電通電）</p>
<p>近衛向岡田進言</p>
<h3>調整日美關係</h3>
<p>現在外交難收成效</p>
<p>（南京）自美返國之近衛貴族院議長、根據與美國名士交換各問題之意見、非正式作成日美問題之意見書、今日分配與岡田首相各閣員及貴衆兩院議院、其内容如下、</p>
<p>（一）禁止移民問題、美國取締方法與其他問題不同、近將與菲島獨立問題同一解决、其如何解决、於日本心理的影響至大、故由此點觀之、爲助長日美親善亦宜積極解决、</p>
<p>（二）日美經濟關係、日本之經濟的進出、美國實業家目爲傾消政策、惟目爲一般的傾消者甚少、又兩國關係、因在互相補助關係、故無競爭於是兩國之産業關係可充分調整、美國專門家主張對於不適宜於本國之産業等不宜强制實施産業之自給政策、應互謀通商之統制、並舉有「我之麵粉業與彼之絲織物業」之實例、故由此點對於日美兩國經濟關係所爲之設施、信受何等暗示、</p>
<p>（三）滿洲問題、目日本爲破壞九國公約者、故遵守所謂史汀生主義靜觀旣成事實、但毫無依法前進以承認之空氣唯一部有力者謂、若繼續現今之事態時、海軍問題並維持太平洋之和平、發生重大之障碍、則應承認之云云、此可注意者、遵守宣言史汀生主義之事態、似不知係和平之障碍、致現則因此其心理相距較遠、故日本承認遠東政策之第一步、應在承認「滿洲國」、日美親善交涉應限定於承認「滿洲國」、但不宜涉及中國問題、致令生疑、</p>
<p>（四）對華政策問題、天羽聲明將廣田嚇爾交換文書所開始之日美親善傾向發生頓挫、令致整日本將在中國獲得排他之獨占支配權、美國輿論所注意者、雖注意日本在滿之行動、尤注意今後中國之動向、故希望明示日本對華政策之界限、與恊力援助對華經濟、惟中等及智識階級則以拉西曼之中國經濟援助報告爲妥當、對日僅勸其恊力、因此對於澈底日本之中國觀、痛感更須努力、</p>
<p>（五）海軍問題、美國對於日本之要求、均異口同聲、以爲係要求絶對的總噸數與艦種别之平等、由此前提、遂反對日本所要求之撤廢比率、關於此點、答以理論上雖係要求平等權、但細目方針未曾公佈時、以爲結果與數年後獲得絶對平等權同一結果、若承認五五五、則日本在遠東之地位將尤優勢、且現今之比率、係以四國公約等防備恊定爲基礎、故如斯恊定、須加改訂、艦種在各國國防之地位、卽其攻擊性與防禦性、除專門家外、並無特異見解、他若戰鬥艦航空母艦之有用性及防禦性之議論亦然、所可注意者、乃在以如何方針討論、方不致令軍縮决裂之一派、彼等以爲比率問題姑置不論、宜由各國互示必要之建艦方針、即以之爲中心、加以討論、故此意見似係由於國防必要並財政要求、始歸結至新比率、</p>
<p>（六）所可驚奇者、美國之輿論深信華府會議及其後國際和平會議之原則、對於滿洲問題、非難日本之態度、或謂日美訂立新恊定之前、日本必須將合於現實之遠東和平新原則、明示美國人、否則不信從來之原則云、若斯狀勢、日美間恐難訂立外交新恊定、此際若干效果所可期待者、祇得變更美國輿論之有力政治家、到達必須與日本訂立何項恊定之意見、因此從來之外交工作範圍及方法、終難獲成效、</p>
<p>（七）日俄關係、美國方面同情日本之軍略地位、惟蘇俄之和平宣傳頗有相當成效、故須注意、（七日電通電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）時報發表社論評日本與蘇俄之關係、略稱一若干人以爲日俄在相當時期之内、勢必發生戰爭、但以吾人所見、此爲冒險之舉、日俄兩國均不願輕於一試、日本國内經濟財政情形、極感困難、蘇俄爲保持蘇維埃制度計、亦非維持和平不可、故皆不利於作戰、以此原因、故兩國互相討論互相談判、並以極微妙之條件、爲討價還價之用、彼此各自防範、以備萬一、其顯然可見者、乃雙方皆欲竭盡外交能力、以圖遷延時日、因而而國所生之事件、遂致日積月累矣、日本日日新聞指責蘇俄謂其對日本及滿洲國」有意採取挑釁政策、該報並稱東京政府將决意採取堅决手段、以資對付、所有兩國間現在進行之談判、將一律擱置、此爲日本報紙之言、但吾人終須待日本政府有正式表示之後、再作斷語、若因報紙之言、遂認爲形勢嚴重、則有欠愼重矣、報紙之消息有不足盡信者、蓋事實未至、而先張大其詞者、乃報界恒有之事、例如半官式報紙、對於某某困難之談判、欲使敵人屈服、乃預先擴大事實以恫嚇之、此其一、又如政府能度游移、而若干有力份子、利於速動、乃造爲種種空氣、在政治上壓迫政府、使之服從若輩之意、此其二、因此二者、故吾人對於日本報紙之言、須審愼聽之也、總之東京政府截至現在止、尚未照日日新聞所述之意、對莫斯科提出交涉、且未以外交手續宣告此種交涉、就日本而論、凡關於「滿洲國」之一切問題、固欲求其解决、此乃至爲明顯之事、日本所最關心者、首爲「滿洲國」承認問題、但由種種方面觀之、足以引起日俄戰爭者、旣非中國福建之事、亦非「滿洲國」之事、其能促成兩國之决裂而至不可挽救者、厥惟蒙古問題、俄人已爲外蒙古之主人翁、而目下日本或其同盟「滿洲國」之勢力、則由熱河及察哈爾漸及於内蒙、蓋内蒙之於日本及「滿洲國」均有切實利益、第以吾人所見卽使蒙古問題發生、日俄之間、亦非不能以某種方式互相妥恊、特中國將受其害耳、綜上所述、吾人對於遠東衝突之流言、宣以沉着及保留態度聆取之、而不可輕於置信也、現在日俄雙方均審愼辯護、但其自爲辯護者、正以彼此相對之政策、曲折紆迴、充滿困難與意外、不可以外交詞令保持其行動之自由耳、吾人所可言者、乃兩國均無必欲破壞和平而爲行險徼倖之志願、蓋戰爭危事也、幸而戰勝、其結果亦有不堪設想者、孰敢輕於一試乎」云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦時報注意</p>
<h3>日本海軍政策</h3>
<p>認其不難召致新糾紛</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報、因研究海軍問題、而注意日本政策、頃該報著文謂、「日本政府之所爲、不難召致新糾紛、蓋岡田首相、一面宣稱反對比率主義、一面又未提任何對案、夫使日本不能置有與其他任何國家力量相等之海軍、在邏輯上固屬不合、然依比例主義支海軍力、以簽訂恊定之原則、一旦承認以後、海軍會議之目的、原不過如此、則各國海軍軍備之多寡、自當以各國防禦之需要爲其常態之測度、日本之態度、今尚未正式通知各國、然所可相信者、日本之提議、或可得總噸數與艦型之縮减、惟無論如何、在倫敦初步談判之時、任何二國、均未成立任何恊定、不獨彰明較著之恊定未曾有之、卽暗中諒解、亦所未覩、此則可以確實言之者也、日本與意大利、雖尚未正式參加海軍談判、但將來談判重開之時、該兩國之海軍專家、當與其他諸國之已表示其意見者、處於同等地位、無所軒輊也、夫簽訂恊定以限制軍備、其利之所在、在實際上已顯而易見矣、所令人不解者、若輩已享裁軍之利益者、今兹猶欲同趨於競爭造艦之途者何耶」云云、（七日哈瓦斯）</p>

<h3>同温層高射砲</h3>
<p>可直射至十英里之遥</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國陸軍部現方試騐一種「同温層高射砲、」以爲空防之用、據稱、此項高射砲尚爲最新發明之空防利器、軍事專家皆以爲可以解决美國之陸地空防問題、美聯社今日得悉、陸軍部射擊學專家希望該項高射砲可直射至十哩之遥、砲上裝有特别電氣機械、可確定飛機在空中之高度·速率·方向等等、非常準確、可稱百發百中、查該項新式武器爲陸軍部空防計劃中之一部、目前因經費缺乏、未能積極進行、據稱、今日陸軍部長鄧恩希望能自公共工程處撥欵美金三千三百萬元先行動工、聞公共工程處對於陸軍部此項建議、殊表同情、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）陸軍部現正準備開始擴大常備軍運動、軍士將由十一萬八千人增至十六萬五千人、官員將自一萬二千人、增至一萬四千人、該部並將向國會要求陸軍補充經費三千五百萬元、據有力官員宣稱、參謀部前曾發表意見、謂美國陸軍不足以保障本國及海外屬地之安全、嗣經陸軍部長鄧恩親往巴拿馬運河區域及西部各地、實地視察後、因以證實參謀部長之言爲不謬云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>澳洲排斥日貨</h3>
<p>實施限制棉布新稅則</p>
<p>日擬停購澳羊毛報復</p>
<p>（南京）澳洲政府八月二日起、對日本棉布課以禁止的關稅、實行排斥日貨、因此日本紡織業者及棉布輸出業者、將受非常之打擊、有主張與實行不買印棉同樣、斷行不買澳洲羊毛、以促澳洲政府之反省者、然據羊毛工業家之意見、謂不買澳洲羊毛、不能實行、僅能减少三四成程度而已、减少之額、可以南美羊毛補充之、紡織聯合會及輸出業者已有此議、且輪船公司如有减低運費之意、則實行减少羊毛輸入數量、自無異議、故報復的輸入制限、有實現之可能性、（七日電通電）</p>

<h3>駐巴拉圭公使</h3>
<p>大厦谷和平運動受打擊</p>
<p>華盛頓深感不安</p>
<p>（華盛頓）智利已準備召回駐巴拉圭公使、故南美形勢今日益形險惡、據美聯社自此間最可靠之外交方面所得消息、智利因巴拉圭首都亞松森報紙所傳消息稱、智利對於大厦谷戰事未能遵守中立、曾向巴國外部要求解釋、未獲滿意之答覆、故將令駐巴公使回國、此項消息接得之後、此間殊覺不安、蓋智利雖未必加入大厦谷戰事、然召回公使之後、將使巴拉圭之鬥志益堅、並使和平運動益難進行也、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞</p>
<h3>内憂外患正殷</h3>
<p>國民思想右傾</p>
<p>蒲哈勒斯羅馬尼亞外交内政經濟之困難漸趨嚴重、隨時可以釀成事變、在國際方面、羅馬尼亞與蘇俄之關係漸趨和緩、可無北顧之憂、此爲唯一可以樂觀之點、但爭執最久之比薩拉比亞問題仍未解决、惟兩國行將恢復外交關係、或能促進此事之和平解决也、此外、巴爾幹公約已完全失敗、未能照預期之收效、希臘爲簽約國之一、今則頗有責言、並限制援引該約、故該公約之價值所餘無幾、羅國與保加利亞之關係雖屬不惡、但未免冷淡、保國現仍拒絶參加該約希望、保王布列斯訪問蒲哈勒斯後展開兩國合作之幻想、今已不復存在、關於西方之匈牙利、則兩國傾軋甚烈、且無和解之望、若以墨索里尼陶爾斐斯及貢博斯成立之羅馬恊定觀之、則小恊約以經濟壓力施諸匈牙利、不得不視爲失敗、羅馬尼亞以爲與匈牙利進行談判無益、但有可注意者、卽多數負責方面稱、對匈預防戰爭之談話、今又盛傳一時、内政方面則羅馬尼亞正徘徊於現行之民主制度及憲政改革之間、而憲政改革則將犧牲國會、擴大政府之權力、國王加羅爾雖未參與政爭、但信脫離現行政制、或能造福國家、自國會改革國家之希望未能實現後、國民遂轉而趨向於右派、尤以青年爲甚、國會内兩大政黨發生爭執適足促進國民思想之右傾、但同樣事變未必不能在最近期内發生、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>羅斯福總統上台的時候、正遇着金融恐慌爆發、全國人心摇動、幸而他運用多年來有訓練的腕力、把這次風潮鎭定了下去、但是一般社會還是不安、失業工人依舊没有工作、没有飯吃、這纔用産業復興法（ＮＲＡ）來救濟當前的恐慌、來給失業者找工作、當實施該法的時候、曾有宣言道、「我决意不使在我們國内有一個餓死的人」、在同一宣言中、他又講到「本年冬季産業界無疑的會脫離黑暗狀態了」、事實究竟是否如此呢、我們祗引用國民雜誌（Ｎation）來作批評就够了、牠說道、「復興局所說的都是欺騙的話、ＮＲＡ所規定的團體契約、不過是一紙空文而已」…從去年六月到十月發生了的罷工糾紛、眞是不勝枚舉、紐約·紐折西·本薛維尼亞·三州所發生生絲工廠的罷工運動參加的人數有七萬五千人、印第安納州有二千炭坑工人罷工、加利福尼亞有四個紡織工人被殺、維阿頓鋼鐵廠二千人罷工、警察曾施放催涙瓦斯彈、犧牲了好幾個人、紡紗工廠的代表有兩百人跑到華盛頓去向强生將軍請願、其他各産業部門、莫不發生罷工風潮、去年年底的總决算、參加罷工的人員、統計有七十八萬七千幾百人、本年入春以來、并不曾有終熄的樣子、到三月爲止、罷工人數的累計有十八萬七千五百餘人、至於全美國所集中注意的鋼鐵工業、汽車工業的罷工運動、算是勉强妥恊鋼定下去了、但是舊金山爲中心的交通工人糾紛、却正在醖釀着很嚴重運動、</p>
<p>據全美工會會長威廉格林的報告說、本年六月初句、失業人數有一千零二十六萬七千人、比去年三月間失業人數最多的時候、减少了三百四十萬人、比去年九月間失業人數最少的時候、增多了十六萬人、今年入春以來、一月間有一千一百六十八萬八千人、現在有了一百四十二萬一千人重新找到職業、總算是多少改善了些、關於就職肤况、雖是略爲改善了、但工資的支給、則并未增加、依照聯邦凖備局的調查、（以一九二三年到一九二五年間平均數爲基凖）、本年五月的工資指數爲六七·一、去年五月爲四二·七、今年一月爲五二·九、由這些數字比較起來、是很顯著的改善了、但此較今年四月則减低了○·一、又據格林氏的說明、去年四月間受失業救濟的家族、有四百四十七萬五千家、一年之後的現在、還是有三百八十五萬、而在救濟緊急失業的名目底下、加算起來、還是在四百六十萬人以上、這種情勢、非但不像有轉佳的形蹟、反而是更見惡化了、再據全美産業研究會的報告、本年五月間男工平均每週工作時間爲三六·一小時、比四月减少了百分一·九、其所得工資、五月爲二十圓八十一仙美金、而四月的工資則爲二十一圓美金、比較减低了百分之○·九、然而在這個期間中工人的生活費、反而上漲了百分之○·三、因此一般工人的生活、更感着不安、而糾紛也就越多、勞資的分化就愈見顯明、所以全美工會、去年的會員約二百多萬人、今年增加到四百餘萬人了、</p>
<p>一般産業活動、據紐約泰晤士報的調查、（假定平常狀態爲一○○）則産業活動的綜合指數、本年四月底爲八八·七、五月底爲八四·九、六月底爲八四·八、其製鋼廠·電力廠·汽車工廠·木材生産·棉花交易數量等等、除電力和汽車以外、無不向下低落、無怪勞工方面呌苦、經濟恐慌還是没有渡過了、</p>
<p>農産物品、最近棉花和小麥都漲了價、但這是人工减低生産與自然减收的影響、農民眞正的收入却并不曾增加、而農民購買力的推移、（如以一九二四·一九二九年五年平均爲基凖）、去年六月爲一○一·三、十二月跌至六一·○、今年五月爲七三·○、比去年五月還更低落、但比去年年底又漲高了十二點於此可見農民購力之不容易增加、其影響於整個經濟也是很大的、實施了産業復興法一年、結果不過如此、恢復繁榮的前途、依舊是很遼遠啊、（七月五日於紐約）</p>

<p>福州通訊、閩北殘赤六千餘人、於七月中旬由羅炳輝統率、由明溪清流、突圍竄入沙縣永安、輾轉竄入尤溪大田、沿途集合土匪、搶掠糧食、踪跡極爲飄忽、至八月一日、忽闖出閩江沿岸、古田閩清境内之閩清口樟湖坂發現匪踪、在臨江截搶船隻、謀刦米鹽以充糧食、致省會與閩北水道交通、爲之斷絶、經閩江守備司令王勁修、電省報告、一面調遺保安隊兩團、極力堵截、自一日下午三時至二日上午四時、閩清口·尤溪口·樟湖坂·三都口·水口·黃田·谷口·灣口·各處臨江地帶、戰事極爲劇烈、幸國軍奮勇作戰、扼守防綫、極爲堅固、匪始不得逞、省方當局、又派兵往援、並有空軍轟炸、水口以下白沙（距福州六十里）以上閩江沿岸匪衆、經陸空軍夾擊之後、勢不能支、卽於二日晚間向水口以上退却、三日上午起、白沙以上沿江兩岸、均無匪踪、前方形勢乃漸緩和、目下由福州西門洪山起、沿江以上、直達水口止、聯成一綫、防務極爲鞏固、東路總司令蔣鼎文、亦於三日下午四時、由漳飛省、指揮一切、現竄集水口以上閩江延平以下沿岸之殘匪、四日已由衛立煌令劉和鼎盧興邦兩師、分從延平尤溪兩路出發兜剿、數日内卽可蕩平、（四日）</p>
<h3>爪哇各業衰落</h3>
<p>東爪哇影響較鉅</p>
<p>小工業尚稱發達</p>
<p>巴達維亞特約通訊、荷蘭在東印度之殖民地、其最富之島、首推爪哇、爪哇雖不甚大、但因其土地肥沃、物産豐饒、故在全世界之市塲中、頗佔一重要之地位、往昔盛時、爪哇全島之輸出量、曾居全世界出口額之第四位、其生産力之鉅大可知、但自不景氣侵入南洋後、世界市塲縮小、爪哇土産無處銷售、皆感過剩、致受一極嚴重之打擊、</p>
<p>爪哇最大最著之工業、而爲世人所孰知者、無過於糖業、自世界糖産過剩後、爪哇之糖業、早已一蹶不振、偉大之糖廠、紛紛停閉、蔗園荒蕪、工人失業者、不可數計、其他事業、亦受極大之連帶影響、兹將東爪哇最近之工業狀况、略誌於下、▲糖業東爪哇之糖業、目前仍無起色、蔗園荒蕪者甚多、尤以瑪琅南部爲最、惟有一例外之事、值得我人之注意者、卽諫義里以南一帶之糖廠、進行甚好、莉苿芬境之蔗園、且有擴大之計議、蓋諫義里所出之糖、另係一種、俗稱角糖、比他地所出之砂糖爲粗、此種糖在東爪哇頗受人歡迎、且運銷國外者亦多、其製法簡單、無須加放他種原料、故成本甚輕、價格特廉、諫義里方面之糖廠、以製此種糖者佔大部份、</p>
<p>香烟東爪哇最重要之工業、除糖業外當推香烟業、在内地如勿里達·多隆亞公·諫義里·以及莉苿芬·惹班·岩望等地、香烟小工廠林立、出品多爲次等貨、因受不景氣影響、大工廠所出之上等香烟、銷路滯鈍、故此種小工業反見興旺也、</p>
<p>瓦磚東爪哇之瓦磚工業、本亦甚著名、但目前因房産跌價、建築房屋者不多、故該業極感疲乏、在勿藍達斯河一帶、出産數减少一半、價格亦低落廿巴仙、工廠停歇者過半、</p>
<p>製皮製皮工業、亦甚退步、錦石皮廠皆已限制出品、從前七家工廠、現僅存二廠、泗水方面華僑所辦之皮廠、因出品銷滯、故亦僅做半工、龐越埠亦然、但市况雖如此不佳、而土人所設之小廠、反爲增多、</p>
<p>火柴東爪哇之火柴廠、因外來火柴之傾銷、不能立足、大半皆已停歇、出品大爲减少、</p>
<p>鐵廠鐵廠景况亦見衰落、尤以泗水爲甚、許多工廠皆已停歇、</p>
<p>紗籠紗籠者卽南洋土人所穿之圍裙、上印花紋、故亦稱花裙、土人無論男女、皆喜穿之、花裙在爪哇本出産甚衆、近因市况不佳、土人無錢購買故極爲衰落、惟自荷印實施限制棉織物進口律頒布後、東爪哇之織布業、已呈現起色、</p>

<p>今日可抵上海</p>
<p>據天文臺報告、颶風已於昨晨六時、至東經一二八度北緯二七度、颶風之範圍四週有六十海浬風向西北西推、在挪哈島之北、兩颶風之中心已併爲一、午後、聞颶風漸向温州洋吹襲、且有向寗波上陸之勢、滬上寗波班輪、因風勢距離尚遠、故尚開航、浙江沿海各輪、亦照常行駛、南華班輪在途中避風者、已有多艘矣、</p>
<p>大美晚報云、據星期二晨徐家匯天文臺報告、晨六時颶風距滬約五百哩、現正向滬進行、每小時速率約十三哩、臨時颶風進至北緯二十七度東經一百二十八度附近、其地乃在琉球島一帶、若照目前之速率與方向、星期三日午後可吹至本埠云、又據徐家匯報告、今之颶風、乃兩颶風於星期一夜在北緯二十六度東經一百二十九度會合爲一、而開始向滬進行、故風力頗劇烈、且料自七日晚起、本埠將有狂風、明日天氣將異常惡劣、因颶風將至、故本埠第二次之熱浪、今日（七日）已大見衰落、今日氣温最高度爲九四、五、昨猶高至九九·五、據現象觀之、本埠氣候似已有轉凉之望也、</p>

<p>滇實業廳長繆雲台</p>
<h3>暢談雲南政情</h3>
<p>對外貿易年出口冶錫二千萬元</p>
<p>改進棉業棉統會允派專家主持</p>
<p>中央社云雲南地處邊陲、交通隔閡、國人對其地方實情頗多隔膜、該省實業廳長繆雲台氏、頃爲計劃創辦該省水電廠事來滬、訪專家研究中央社記者、特往訪詢、承告該省政治經濟情况、及數年來工商建設事業之發展、甚爲詳盡、兹特紀述如下、</p>
<p>計劃電廠</p>
<p>繆氏此次來滬、係因該省創辦水電廠將所擬計劃訪專家研究據談、滇省年來因地方安定、人民樂業故一切工商事業、逐漸發展、惟興辦工廠、先决問題、在求低價而便利之原動力、該省現僅有石龍壩水氣廠一處、供電二千迁、因原力取給、旣不普遍、多數工廠、咸以蒸汽機、其設備費用至鉅平均佔資本額之半數、而其平日之費用亦甚大、省府在努力提倡之餘、現决創設一大規模之水電廠、地點已擇定省會昆明西北之富氏縣其地有堂郎川、自昆明湖滇池）經安寗等四縣、而入金沙江、富氏在堂郎川之上游、水勢甚急共傾斜度爲每哩五十六米、永量爲每科鐘四十五立方米、頃計可供電四萬迁其全部所需經費、約在二千萬左右、而土木工程所需、佔其八成、幸滇省人民、對此建設事業、認爲急切需要、故一部份工程、人民自願效力而滇省亦因年來工商發、省庫富足、故一俟計劃完成即可興工、至將來電力供給、定價爲每ＫＷＨ銀一分較上海電價、僅及六分之一、　　冶錫進步</p>
<p>滇省多山、鑛藏豐富、惟以交通不便、貨棄於地、頗爲可惜、惟箇舊冶錫、素稱全國之冠、而輸往倫敦紐約者、爲數至鉅、但以前各廠所産、向無標凖、輪往國外者、均先在香港改裝、並須經香港政府化騐證明、始能運往歐美銷售、省政府經數年之提倡改良、已有顯著之進步、現在輸往紐約倫敦者、均由鐵路運往海防、直接出口、而以前必須香港政府證明者、現在憑省政府之化騐證書、即可直接輸出、每年出口之價值、約爲二千萬元、其在我國對外貿易上、實佔一巨大之成數、而在滇省之國民經濟上、亦一主要之收獲、加之箇舊昔爲窮鄕、現已爲工商之重地、其地除有省辦之箇舊臨屏鐵這、與滇越鐵路聯絡、便利運輸外、更自設無綫電台、與倫敦紐約互通電報、接洽商業、自去年以來、所有運銷歐美之錫、均由箇舊與倫敦紐約通電成盤、此種國際貿易情形、在我國内地城鎭、尚屬罕見、</p>
<p>工商情况</p>
<p>滇省出産、種類頗多、故其人民食用所需、頗可自給、且有輸出各省、及國外者、如牛羊皮·藥材·山貨·茶葉等、運銷各省甚多、黃絲白絲石黃紫根等洋漆之原料、運往印度緬甸、而如雜糧蔬菜水菓等、則運往安南、至滇省所輸入者、如肥皂火柴等、現亦能自製自給、惟輸入最大之紗布及建築材料、則仍仰給於上海、約佔入省品百分之九十、其半數爲棉紗等原料、及半成品、至於工業情形、亦漸見進步、以前人工織布機、大多粗劣、自新式人工織布機輸入後、省城各工廠、均爭先仿製、在近兩年中、此機約有八百部、現在出品旣良、而幅面亦寛、針織機、在三年内、亦增至一百五十部、其他如綫衫等織機、亦有輸入、在逐漸發展中、政府僅處於監督之地位、予以恊助、現更爲一般建築事業之發展起見、將設一士敏士廠、以供給低價之建築原料、</p>
<p>改進棉業</p>
<p>滇省棉紗原料、旣不能自給故省府對紡織事業之發展不遺餘力、繆氏謂、此次來滬、並與全國經委會棉業統制委員會商洽、已得相當辦法、蓋該省已組有棉業推廣委員會、改良棉種以來、頗有效果、同時並將設紡紗織布廠各一所、以自製服用物品惟該省興辦事業旣夥、所費金錢已多對此一項、棉統會已允派專家兩人、前往主持、尚望更能予以經濟之恊助、省政府自亦視力之所能、籌欵從事、</p>
<p>公路建設</p>
<p>滇省交通索稱不便、而境内河流雖多、亦因山水湍急、不便舟運故藉以交通者均爲車馬、年來少府對公路建設、亦積極進行、其公路計劃、係以省會爲中心、而分佈至各處、現巴完工通車者、有自省會至玉溪·曲靖·祿平·柳樹沙·等四條、預定本年内完工者、有自省會至東川·開化·黃草壩等三條、其自省會至大理一條、則定明年内完工、而已通車之各路、現有省辦公共汽車公司一家、商辦者八家、經營運輸事業、故交通尚稱便利、惟滇省地處邊陲、爲西南之屏障、其關係國防、甚爲重要、故交通設備、須求便利、現省辦公路、旣逐漸發展、而開築鐵路、更爲需要、希望中央、能注意及之、而加以興築、</p>
<p>地方安定</p>
<p>繆氏更談及地方治安情形、據謂、該省自辛亥革命後因省軍出動土匪即乘機蠭起、連年省内匪亂不已至十九年龍主席統一軍政、即擬定剿匪計劃、預計三年肅清、而以軍紀嚴厲、士兵用命、故在兩年内、即已肅清、全省地方旣安實業以興、現在省庫、年有餘欵以從事種種建設事業、更因省内幣制統一、其外匯價格亦低、故輸出物品、旣獲嬴利、人民亦漸富足、惟其生活程度則仍低、繆氏更語記者、該省現亦成立一經濟委員會、直隸省政府下、聘請專家、以從事各種建設事業之設計研究凡有大規模之建設事業、必交該委員會縝密研究、而該會並對全省經濟組織調查研究後、擬具計劃、以供政府之實行云、繆氏約在滬勾留一二星期後、即返省云</p>
<h3>意船中國人同舟大會</h3>
<p>本月四日到滬之意船康脫凡第ＣonteVerde號中、有我國前駐智利代辦李時霖氏、粤空軍總司令黃光銳、出席國際勞工大會我國代表李平衡·陜主席邵力子哲嗣遂初、招商局督辦劉鴻生兩公子、本埠宋啟文君、以及其他由歐美各國考察或留學回國者、約七十餘人、爰由李代辦發起開一同舟大會、以冀交換思想、聯絡感情、將來爲國家社會服務時、可得相互恊贊、增進效能之益、該會於船經紅海中舉行、雖值酷熱、汗流浹背之時、而到會者幾達全數、首由李君宣布開會宗旨、逐一通名介紹、繼演說餘興攝影而散、該會擬編一題名錄、分送各人、以留紀念、並聞李代辦駐節智利多年、與報界聞人過從甚密、刋載國聞、極蒙便利、以是該國朝野對於我國頗有好感、僑胞亦因之受惠不淺此次返國公餞時、該國各報主筆諄託代請國内報界、隨時通信、俾得盡量刋布、藉敦兩國友好、李君亦深以此舉能引起南美諸邦同情、我國對於外交貿易僑務等頗多利賴、立允所請故一俟今晚晋京到外部報告歸來、如無要公、卽將訪晤本市報界、代申前請云、</p>

<h3>應令公共汽車改善</h3>
<p>宜看重市民行走安全</p>
<p>裝置如保險梗之設備</p>
<p>新聲社云、納稅華人會昨致函公共租界工部局云、逕啟者、關於陶安仁君被公共汽車撞傷一案、前准台復、謂公共汽車無過誤可尋、如有塤害賠償問題、逕向該汽車公司交涉等由、當即轉知去後、兹又據本會秘書陶樂勤君覆稱、查小兒安仁　撞時所乘之自由車、其後輪已全被撞毆、現尚存放陣祥記車行、僅可調查、竊思　禍時、如小兒錯走路綫或自不小心而撞於公共汽車者、則前輪應有損傷、拿前輪無損、後輪全　、其爲公共汽車</p>
<p>不鳴喇叭　　具　已屬臺無疑義、是當時雖無人證、然物證固極顯用、而工部局謂公共汽車無過悮可尋、不知何所據而云然、嘗觀馬路中人力車、或其他車輛等、撞倒行人、例須帶人捕房、或予懲處、或令賠償、俱有相當辦法、獨於公共汽車、則不惟一無處置、反爲之遮飾曰、無過誤可尋、凡此現像、謂非偏袒、其誰信之、該局對於公共汽車公司、一則曰未曾使用之公共汽車、俱經警務處檢查、再則曰車夫亦受相當訓練、執此以觀、工部厄於華人汽車肇禍、雖亦檢查訓練、仍必嚴究、而於公共汽車公司、可謂極盡關切之能事、所惜該汽車公司不爭氣、行每不顧工部局之言、如上月二十七日、第十路公共汽車、行經西華德路時、竟駛入</p>
<p>同仁醫院之門診間、以一引擎有損之病車、不向車行修理、而乃就診於同仁醫院、豈非滑天下之大稽、工部局嘗謂公共汽車肇禍之新聞、乃報紙摭拾浮言而來、然則上月十三日、路公共汽車、於融光影戲院門首、因錯走路綫、次撞死大小三命、同月二十一日、經第一特區地方法院判决、公共汽車司機人吳錦堂、處徒刑一年、皇皇判令、豈亦報章之摭拾浮言耶、總之公共汽車搆造不良、有碍公共秩序、</p>
<p>妨害行人實爲不可掩之事實、工部局不欲取締之則已否則未可任之只圖近利、而忽公衆之遠謀也、夫被創於公共汽車者、類多貧苦小民、謀食之不追、安有餘力及餘暇、起與有權有勢而兜得轉之公共汽車公司相抗、然積怨之下、必無好果、故爲未雨綢繆計、亟應改善其搆造、或增設防預之具、若謂全球各國無從購置此項安全之器具、直是推諉遁詞、蓋租界中各種設備、豈盡爲各國所有者、竊意凡物當視其需要而産生、從前界内有軌無軌電車、</p>
<p>固無鐵栅門之設備、試用之初、乘客以啟閉稽時、嘖有煩言、當時外報亦多譏評、而工部局不恤人言、必欲裝置、無非爲防患未然計耳、何獨於公共汽車之防禍設備、漠然任之、而不予想法、任令横衝直撞、草菅人命、豈亦投鼠忌器耶、鄙見他姑勿論、但以普通汽車而言、車輪固小於公共汽車、其前後俱裝有保險梗、公共汽車兩輪突出於前、而乃一無掩護、路人設遇碰撞、即易</p>
<p>輾入輪底故最低限度、公共汽車亦應裝置類如保險梗之裝置、而引伸其效用、以增益之、此固不必俟至各國新有發明、而後可以仿用者、如並此而不獲行、則負有監督公用事業之職權者、類皆尸位素餐、因人成事、·實無以副納稅人之望、將不知何以自解小兒此次被英商公共汽車撞傷、尚幸未至於死、損失雖鉅、但爲公衆案全計、求工部局令公共汽車公司、因此而得一較善之設備、雖痛定思痛、於願已足、敬祈貴會轉函工部局、飭令公共汽車公司、迅即設法改善防患之具、以保民命、無任公感、至應否令公共汽車公司</p>
<p>賠償損害問題、自有公正機關之公道主張、兹不贅及、「且即贅及爲效甚微也」、等情到會、查公共汽車搆造不健全、則駛欠謹愼、爲不可否認之事實、陶君所稱、最低限度、亦應有如保險梗之裝設、實爲平心靜氣之論、未知貴局何厚於公共汽車、而必加以袒護、據函前情、用特再函奉達、務希看重納稅市民行走之安全、令知英商公共汽車公司、速即設法改善、勿再强詞辯護、以順與望、仍祈見覆爲荷、此致上海公共租界工部局總辦、</p>

<p>周浦姚季康氏、有女名文賢、年已及笄、自幼憑媒許字與曹震裕茶號小文曹誠垣、奈曹姓崇尚自由、對於父母所聘之姚女婚姻、大爲不滿、曾以出亡尋死等種種要挾、恐嚇其父、以冀解除姚姓婚姻、而女父亦以大度處之、於是雙方承認解約、詎料文賢聞之、一慟幾絶、卒以因此成病、於前月香消玉殞、遺恨九泉、大公社記者昨赴姚寓、探訽此事底藴、姚翁首稱、長女文賢、幼秉慧性、見識</p>
<p>異於常人七歲入楊潔女校、至十二歲、余應同事曹誠炳之求親、將女許配曹姓、小女文賢、素知曹子浪漫成性、知後曾提出異議、乃木已成舟、悔亦無益、從此居恒鬱鬱寡歡不願再求深造、及至去年春間、得悉曹姓提議解除婚約、驚駭異常、余得女函返家、見女哭不成聲、不食者已二日、余追訽曹姓解約理由、說爲父子勃谿而出之、吾女受此重大剌激、恨不欲生、閒談之間、常吐怨言、在當時以女兒一時之氣、不無傷心之語、時加安慰、惟女志潔高超、從此悲懷濁世、即常云、人之所以異於禽獸者、糜恥而已、今竟仗勢、予棄予求、女界人權剥奪盡矣、惡濁之世、吾實羞居也、嗟乎、聆其所發之言語、觀其貞烈之操守、可以知其爲人矣、從此朝暮</p>
<p>常現涙痕不知其死心更决也、於是精神日疲及至廢曆三月二十七日、不能支持、臥床不起、乃請李蘭坪醫師診治、斷謂傷心所至、病勢已深、大小暑之間要留心、余聞之大駭、偶爾一病、何以竟至於此、繼請喬冰如諸生診察、均以是斷、余見難挽回、詢其有何遺恨、答以兒虚度人間、毫無報答、有累父母、兒罪大矣、兒身雖亡、兒心不死言時、其涙奪眶而出、蓋其傷心之處、雖未明言、已可知矣、吾兒文賢、賦性恬淡、與之言、訥訥然、而外樸内明、心思極巧、凡女紅之事、一見便能、每逢樂事、祇見微笑、而至患難、必力爲解除、至於待人接物、從無疾言厲色、對於弟妹、愛護無微不至、更且廣面豐頥、長顔隆凖、毫無知壽之相、不幸延至廢曆五月二十六日去世、鳴呼傷哉、吾兒爲人處世、皆爲余所不及、若無此變、必爲</p>
<p>賢婦良母若易釵而弁、其所見識作事、必能爲鄕梓服務、今不幸遭此奇變、天忌之耶、人嫉之耶、抑吾無福不能有此女也、傷哉傷哉、吾兒之夭亡、雖受曹姓之賜、無可諱言、但余有眼無珠、早不從兒之拒婚於前、又不能挽救於後、使兒含恨長埋、殺兒之罪、誠難辭矣、余自愧不文、不能追述其生世、兹草輓聯一付、聊以誌哀、姚翁言畢、遂將輓語示記者輓云、「汝志何高超、悲懷濁世、默守舊道德、萬事少預防、使兒埋愁、咎將誰屬」、「女心太堅决悵觸前塵、不隨新時代、一死早認定、恨吾未識、責有攸歸」、</p>

<h3>姦殺案訊結</h3>
<p>三角戀愛之結果</p>
<p>陸王氏押候宣判</p>
<p>無錫人强福根、因三角戀愛、在兆豐公園左近遭張漢章用刀戳斃、案發張即逃逸、僅將案中主角陸王氏獲解法院檢察處、奉雷彬章檢察官偵查明確、以預謀殺人、提起公訴、曾奉關立廷推事開庭審訊未結、候冉傳證各情、迭紀前報、兹悉此案昨日上午九時、仍由關推事特開第五法庭續審、法官升座後、命提在押之陸王氏至案、詰據供稱、此次張漢章殺害强福根、我事前並未預聞、次據證人周文伯供、年二十七歲、崑山人、住崑山蓬萊鎭西街、開設烟紙雜貨店生理、昔年我在太平橋醬園爲司賬時、與陸王氏之夫陸義章、有</p>
<p>生意來往</p>
<p>因此與陸王氏認識、問、本年五月二十一日、陸王氏到你家來過否、答、我因患吐血病、在去年九月間、搬回崑山蓬萊鎭西街、間、你欠强福根多少欵項、答、不欠姓强的錢、祇欠陸家五十元、况在本年四月還過十元利息、訊至此、官謂陸王氏曰、你曾供過周文伯欠强福根五百元、五月二十一日、你到過周家、剛才周文伯稱不欠强福根錢、况且他家旱已搬遷了、陸王氏語塞、官曰、你完全講的假話、又命證人蔣宗德至案供、上海人、住小北門崇德坊二號雜糧生意、問、你與陸王氏什麽關係、答、與陸義璋是朋友、所以認識陸王氏、問、陸王氏</p>
<p>預謀殺人</p>
<p>你知道否、答、不知道、祇曉得出事的一天下午三點鐘時候、由曹家渡打來電話、係托轉達對門陸家接話、惟曹家渡誰打來電話、則我不知、其時陸王氏適在我家閑談、我即喚陸王氏聽電話、不知道電話内說些什麽話、大約過了一小時後、陸王氏來打電話、約有數十分鐘之久、話還没有講完、我因本店有事、要打電話、所以上前催她、在這個時候、聽見陸王氏向對方說、此刻没有功夫、要到晚上才能來、說到這句話、陸王氏方始將</p>
<p>聽筒掛斷</p>
<p>就回家去了等語、又據證人王葉氏供、年四十三歲、湖州人、住獅子弄二十八弄二號問、你與陸玉氏什麽關係、答、是姑嫂、官曰、爾等旣爲至親、則證言不足取信、官命退下、又傳强馮氏至案供、無錫人、住三馬路畫錦里二號、爲包飯作生理、出事之曰、由六區警局來電話云、我姪福根、在小石橋地方被害、現在海格路紅十字會醫院醫治、我聞耗大驚、即乘車趕至醫院、會見福根、據稱、遭陸王氏誘我到兆豐花園去遊玩、行至小石橋地方、不料張漢章預伏在彼、持刀奔出、將我猛戳、因陸王氏挽住我手、致受其害、我之性命、恐難保全、如有不測、求</p>
<p>叔母伸寃</p>
<p>等語、我聆言、悲痛萬分、未幾、我姪果因傷身死、請求伸雪云云、末據屍母强沈氏供稱、我一家全賴福根養活、現被陸王氏·張漢章·等謀殺身死、日後依靠誰人、要求庭長爲子伸寃、並請追私訴、以資生活、訊至此、問官遂請雷彬章檢察官蒞庭論告意見、略謂、被告陸王氏係與强福根·張漢章·是否通姦、但强福根未死之前、與陸王氏姘識、嗣後又與張漢章姘識、雖陸王氏堅不承認、然觀察陸王氏之舉動、就可以明瞭、可見强福根講的話是實在的、據陸王氏說、張漢章借給强福根洋五百元、强因</p>
<p>無力歸還</p>
<p>而陸王氏又到周文件家索錢、這明明都是假話、而小石橋地方出事時、陸王氏挽住强福根的手、張漢章用刀猛戳、足證預謀、事實上極爲顯明、况陸王氏與强福根同出遊玩、强福根旣遭被害、陸王氏爲何不呼救命、又不去報告警局、出事之後、又避不回家、陸王氏實爲預謀殺人、</p>
<p>毫無疑義</p>
<p>請爲公判云云、遂開始辯論、被告所延之潘仁希·姚君喻·兩律師、先後起立、爲之辯護一過、繼由毛鳳五律師代理、原告請求追償私訴、以强福根生前每月能賺一百六十元、以二年計算、並衣棺等費洋三百餘元、兩共請追洋四千三百元、問官復問陸王氏最後有無陳述、答、我如在外面有不規則行爲、我丈夫安肯爲我請律師辯護呢、問官認爲終結、定於本月十三日上午九時宜判、陸王氏還押、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>續「翻譯本的錯誤和疑難」</h3>
<p>丨答杜洛基君丨</p>
<p>在前次的「翻譯本的錯誤和疑難」中，我們解釋了李達譯的唯物論敎程二書上的幾個錯誤和疑難的問題。這是我們的新嘗試，我們相信這對於讀者的讀書一定有很多帮助。近年來中國的譯書很多，但常常是不可靠的，例如温盛光所譯的杉山榮的社會科學十一講，有很多原文上極淺近的地方，被譯者譯得莫明其妙，讀者常常將上面不通的句字拿來問我們，連答覆都没有辦法。這樣的譯本，我們只有索性請讀者不要看，免得白費力氣。至於李達的這本敎程，因爲原書也很有價值，譯筆除了很少的錯誤外，大體也都還很好，所以我們特地將我們根據讀者來信而發見到的疑難，繼續發表出來，努力使該書成爲完璧的譯本，希望讀者以後能够再發問題，使得我們可以有更多的發見。（未完）</p>

<h3>怎樣做到大衆語的「普遍」？</h3>
<p>— 陳望道</p>
<p>丨三路並進陳望道</p>
<p>吳稚暉先生在「大衆語萬歲」一封信裏，特意提到我，隨後又接連喊了「大衆語萬歲」和「文學不死，大禍不止」兩個口號，意思無非要把我上次提出的「大衆語文學」攔腰劈斷，表示他的上取下棄。他所以要棄文學，實際。是一種傷心話，故意說得過份一點，我很懂得。記得他在「杭育」一九二四年四月二十日的編輯話上曾經說過：「我們這班老怪物，於甲午割地，庚子聯軍進京，見而知之，所以想到了，便把詩思打斷。」眞意不過呌人不要忽略科工，不要輕看物質文明。這有很多吳先生自已的話可以證明，（譬如他在「科學和人生」一篇演講稿裏說「這三種（文學），哲學，科學）互相循環，都是需要的，不過現在的青年，太偏於文學和哲學罷了」）。現在暫且不談。單談吳先生喊「萬歲」的大衆語。關於大衆語，吳先生特别提出了「並遍」這一個特色。他說：「文言，白話，大衆語，有容易普遍與不容易普遍之分。當然白話比文言容易普遍，大衆語一定更比白話容易普遍」。這話反過來說，便是「白話比大衆語特殊，文言比白話更特殊」。從特殊到普遍去，我們應該怎樣走呢！吳先生已經指出了一條路，就是從士話（特殊）走到統一語（普遍）。他說：「倷伲也有大衆，阿拉也有大衆。倷伲的大衆，把倷伲的語文合一起來，阿拉的大衆把阿拉的語文合一起來，（是第一步）。倷伲的大衆與阿拉的大衆，有了合一的語文，又互相合一起來。一種統一語，還讓大衆來造成，是第二步。」這條路向，我們可以呌做「從下送上」。要肅清文言，要提高大衆文化的時候必需走。走這條路的方法，我知道吳稚暉陶知行先生們都很有經騐，將來一定會得細細地告訴我們。大體的方法，他們兩位已經說過，差不多個個字都是實際上磨練出來的，很可以做我們參考。但是這一路，與文言没有直接關涉。從現在的情形說來，没有别一路的人迎凑上來，也不容易收到多大的實際效果。現在我們没有力量替倷伲的大衆阿拉的大衆倃們的大衆以及其他一切等等的大衆，各别編報出書。那些大衆學了第一步語文合一的大衆語，用處不過通信記賬，他們又没有多少信可通，多少賬好記，一定引不起他們强烈的興趣。就使學了，也因不常用，不久便會送還先生這裏需要記者，文人，學者，事業家，從文言等「特殊」專解放出來，「從上迎下」去。又需要語言學者，普及敎育家們，多做些比較普遍可讀的書，多調查點各地通行的語彚，文法，多開些語言學校養成語言師範人材，多編出些普通語辭出來，「從横通過」去。這樣三路並進，那「普遍」的大衆語才容易完成。建立大衆語的路綫，據我想來，大體如下圖。不知大家以爲怎樣倘若這圖畫的不錯，那便需要一切的人手都來努力，各從自已的站脚處向着一個公共的中心「普遍」走。</p>
<h3>看書瑣記</h3>
<p>— 焉于</p>
<p>高爾基很驚服巴爾札克小說裏寫對話的巧妙，以爲並不描寫人物的模樣，却能使讀者看了對話，便好像目覩了說話的那些人。（八月份「文學」内「我的文學修養」）</p>
<p>中國還没有那樣好手段的小說家，但「水滸」和「紅樓夢」的有些地方，是能使讀者由說話看出人來的。其實，這也並非什麽奇特的事情，在上海的衖堂裏，租一間小房子住着的人，就時時可以體騐到。他和周圍的住户，是不一定見過面的，但只隔一層薄板壁，所以有些人家的眷屬和客人的談話，尤其是高聲的談話，都大略可以聽到，久而久之，就知道那里有那些人，而且彷彿覺得那些人是怎樣的人了。</p>
<p>如果刪除了不必要之點，只摘出各人的有特色的談話來，我想，就可以使别人從談話裏推見每個說話的人物。但我並不是說；這就成了中國的巴爾札克。作者用對話表現人物的時候，恐怕在他自已的心目中，是存在着追人物的模樣的，於是傳給讀者，使讀者的心目中也形成了這人物的模樣。但讀者所推見的人物，却並不一定和作者所設想的想同，巴爾札克的小鬍鬚的清瘦老人，到了高爾基的頭裏，也許變了粗蠻壯大的絡腮鬍子，不過那性格，言動，一定有些類似，大致不差，恰如將法文翻成了俄文一樣，要不然，文學這東西便没有普遍性了。</p>
<p>文學雖然有普遍性，但因讀者的體騐的不同而有變化，讀者倘没有類似的體騐，牠也就失去了效力。譬如我們看「紅樓夢」，從文字上推見了林黛玉這一個人，但須排除了梅博士的「黛玉葬花」照相的先入之見，另外想一個，那麽，恐怕會想到剪頭髮，穿印度綢衫，清瘦，寂寞的摩登女郎；或者别的什麽模樣，我不能斷定。但試去和三四十年前出版的「紅樓夢圖詠」之類裏面的畫像比一比罷，一定是截然兩樣的，那上面所畫的，是那時的讀者的心目中的林黛玉。</p>
<p>文學有普遍性，但有界限；也有較爲永久的，但因讀者的社會體騐而生變化。北極的遏斯吉摩人和菲洲腹地的黑人、我以爲是不會懂得「林黛玉型」的；健全而合理的好社會中人，也將不能懂得，他們大約要比我們的聽講始皇焚書，黃巢殺人更其隔膜。一有變化，卽非永久，說文學獨有仙體，是做夢的人們的夢話。</p>
<h3>淄博印象（續六月二十八日）</h3>
<p>— 羅王</p>
<p>（五）遍地黃金屬誰家？</p>
<p>離開了淄川，乘張（店）博（山）支路，便到達了博山。</p>
<p>出了車站便看到堆煤站，推煤車到處是黑亮晶的煤炭，在博山，地上盡是些黑土，公務人員夏季不敢穿白制服袴，而以馬袴代之，原因就是道路上的煤屑和泥土飛揚，一會兒白衣便要變成了黑布！</p>
<p>博山是山東！也可以說是中國的一個特别縣，這是一個煤與礦的工商業區。此地山崗起伏，川流縱横，而煤礦散佈四鄕，發掘即是！所以人民大多靠開礦過活，有的還發財。博山農産品是不够吃，得仰給於外來米糧的供給。</p>
<p>博山地下的礦産之多，難以數述，除最出名的煤礦外，有瓷土，砂土，玻璃原料，黃丹，白礬、黑礬，紅土，鐵，鉛，銅，石灰，雲母石，寶石，銻…等。特産有煤（數十種），玻璃，料貨，淄石硯，瓷器，窰貨，木器等！所以博山民衆不必去耕田，只要會找，可以說遍地是黃金！然而如今中國啊！沉澱在不改良的小手工業裏面，農村破産，社會經濟恐慌，加之資本帝國主義者的加緊壓迫與剥削，博山地，財富雖多，而人民除了淪爲破産了的工人而外，没有與帝國主義者機器力抗爭的力量！這眞是可惜的！</p>
<p>博山雖然煤礦甚多，小資本的煤井亦復不少，但純用人工的發鑿與運輸，終敵不過工業機器化的博東公司産量的可驚</p>
<p>說起博東公司來，與淄川的魯大公司一樣，似爲中日合辦，實際上却成了日本海軍的生命綫！那裏産出的無烟煤，據說是專作軍艦上用的！所以日本政府對於淄博情形比我們中國人調查得親切！社會狀况，人家比我們了解的更多！試看那招展在車站附近日本租借地的太陽旗，不難想像到兩句話：「試問今日之域中，竟是誰家之天下」！</p>
<p>舉個例說吧！當民十七濟南五三慘案發生，沿膠濟路的各縣縣下稡全被日人驅出二十里外，博山縣長就曾移居過二十里外的原泉莊，直到濟案解决，才得遷回！從這種事變看來，中國人在中國領土内還有行政權吧？回憶過去，俯視目前，推想將來，眞不知遍地黃金屬誰家啊！</p>
<h3>快樂同我没有好姻緣</h3>
<p>— 蒲風</p>
<p>丨丨上海心聲之二丨丨</p>
<p>從來便没有打算過怎麽樣去享樂，可是，當幾位朋友硬拉我進大跳舞塲去看看時，我没有法子拒絶。</p>
<p>爵士樂，狐步舞……誠然，這不算什麽新鮮貨色。正因爲這不是新鮮貨色，我曉得我的本分，現今，難道搜遍我的全身，我還有跟他們一樣享樂的福份嗎？</p>
<p>「跳吧丨不妨試試。」朋友們忙着催旁人行下水禮。</p>
<p>跟着一陣紅一陣藍的燈光，人們都非常忙碌般的，好像疲勞永不會爬上他們的眉尖。但是，天，爲什麽我心裏却轆轆地在轉，總打不起半點興趣來呢？紅藍燈帶給我的是疲倦跟瞌睡，瞌睡好像富有誘惑能力的魔術家，好容易就誘惑了我。丨丨突的我這樣想起：爲什麽要活生生地在此地受罪？</p>
<p>於是，毅然地站了起來，說了一個謊，告辭了友人。朋友的挽留無效，大街上，我自已又聽見了自已的足音。跟着踏踏的脚步，我心底譜成了這樣的心聲：</p>
<p>我獨自支持我顚連的運命，</p>
<p>不怕風吹雨打浪中漂。</p>
<p>穿過黝黯隂森的狹道，</p>
<p>我追求光明的照耀。</p>
<p>快樂同我没有好姻緣，</p>
<p>給我層層的磨折吧，</p>
<p>願在槍林彈雨中出入，</p>
<p>願在危波駭浪裏摇。</p>
<p>到了家裏，我才輕鬆了一口氣。拿起日記本子，我在揮寫。我，我不會忘記寫上這幾句：「快樂同我没有好姻緣，這也許還只是最初的一次「逃」哩！」</p>
<h3>我來自東（十七）</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>我們在東京轉個圈兒，朋友告訴我東京的幾種奴隸生活，妓女，工人，尤其是女工們。妓女館門口掛着妓女們的照片，下面寫着價目。據說開這些妓女館的老板，都是百萬巨富。咖啡店，那比較大些的，完全是歐美式的佈置。我們去的一家，還有鄭孝胥的題字，鄭孝胥題字下有一個大無綫電收音機，在你吃點冰淇淋時，機上又警告着戰禍之將到來。</p>
<p>東京給我兩點印象，第一是忙，第二是嚴重。在忙中帶着發狂；在嚴重中帶着憂慮。在東京驛的守車室裏，你可以看見成千成百的男女，拿着報紙讀個不已。在中國没有這種現象，在美國也没有這個現象。戴着銀邊眼鏡，留着唇上的小鬍，板着日本人特有的苦臉，在車站裏忽忽忙忙的來去。這些日本人，受了統治階級的宣傳，受了政府及軍閥的麻醉、眞的以爲日本只有有兩條大路，支配全世界或戰敗而國亡。在車上，在街上，你看見的是苦臉，是可憐相的臉，是自裝正經的臉，是冷中有懼的臉，他們不大笑。他們嘴老是築着，結實的築着不動。車上大家着報，所看的都是關於飛機，大砲，外交，軍隊，榮譽，侮辱一類東西白本是一個小小的鐵皮鞭砲。日本的政府及統治階級在裏面天天把砲内火藥烘熱，小鞭砲是要炸的，炸時有很大的聲音。帶着愁臉的東京人，天天在憂懼或盼望的這大炸發聲之到來，或者在轟炸之日，盼望者化爲憂懼，憂懼者或會化爲盼望，然而問題的確是嚴重的。他們也的確知道在嚴重局面之下要發狂一樣忙着的。忙，道是多重要的一種特性。美國有此，日本人也有此，德國人意大利人及俄羅斯人，又何嘗没有嚴重的時期，只有我們手斷臂折的中國，還在醉生夢死之中，貪苟且的麻醉，而不覺劍鋒已穿透了心胸，待劍鋒抽出，還不知何處來的這樣多鮮血！</p>
<h3>久别了，上海！</h3>
<p>海水漸漸地發黃，山黃色化爲黃濁色，長江口快近了。那水眞是濁得特别，船過浪起，浪中帶着泥漿，看起來好像很重，是中國的河山了。三年前出國，雖然當時東北已有不穩的傳聞，决不料在我足踏到異國的土地十幾天以後，便劈當似的來個局部亡國的消息，我的眼前又是祖國，祖國已經不是三年前的狀態。同船有位吉林省學生，我更不知他心中會怎樣的難受。</p>

<h3>以惡勢力下提倡體育鎭潮</h3>
<p>貢獻於楊秀瓊女士和歡迎者</p>
<p>中國的國家、是在新舊過渡的時期、中國的社會、還未脫去封建社會的束縳、社會的智識、還是這般的淺薄、在這樣的國家和社會中、要推進一椿新的事情、當然要感到不少的阻力和困難、體育運動在中國、至少還是一椿新的事情、更其是女子體育運動、阻力和困難、是意料中的一回事、我們提倡體育運動的成功和失敗、就全要看我們能否戰勝這阻力和困難、</p>
<p>推進力和阻力、是成反比例的、推進力愈大、同時阻力也愈大、在中國的半封建社會中、提倡體育運動、正是同樣的情形、所以我們在推進和提倡的時候、應該怎樣的小心、怎樣的留意、走入歧路、是多麽容易的一回事、</p>
<p>在提倡體育運動的人、要感到相當的困難、在運動員的本身、也何嘗不如此、只要你有較好的成績、外來的勢力、社會的引誘、會把你吸引到自滿自足目空一世的虚榮路上、升得愈高的、也必暴跌得愈狂烈、在過去運動員的歷史、可引證不少的例子、在中國做運動員、眞不是容易的事、中國運動員成績的不長進、一下就到了頂點、不進、也就是這個原因、</p>
<p>楊秀瓊女士的游泳天才和成績、在中國是絶無僅有的、在海外能揚眉吐氣、二十年來的中國體育界、也是一個新紀元、所以楊女士的到處歡迎和擁戴、是應該受的、也應該有的、應該向她表示欽佩和景仰、同時對於楊女士的天才、應該如何的愛護和提倡、</p>
<p>最近楊女士因爲應南昌新生活運動俱樂部的邀請、北上表演、一時轟動江南、到處狂熱、當然不能不說是提倡體育的好現象、然而最近我們看到歡迎楊女士的情形和行動、實在覺得心有所危、而深感有走上歧路的危險、</p>
<p>歡迎者的動機、我們不敢說他們不是提倡體育、和對楊女士個人表示景仰、也不敢說他們不懂得提倡體育的方法和原理、但是愛之愈甚、害之愈深在中國對建的社會中、如此的來對付十六歲姑娘的楊女士、敎育未深、意志尚薄的楊女士、能否會發生不良的影響和結果、甚至於影響社會的觀感、而造就一個目空一世自滿自足的運動員、社會的看待她、也如同看梅蘭芳看海京伯一樣的神秘和希奇、而廣告式的歡迎、更其是不必言、在提倡歡迎者、有没有想到會把體育陷落到和江湖賣藝之流一樣、在台下喝幾聲采、拍幾陣手、呌幾聲好的惡現象中的危險、對楊女士個人、不是歡迎、簡直侮辱了、</p>
<p>歡迎楊女士、不過是提倡體育運動的一個例子、眞眞愛護楊女士的話、應該用正當的方法來奬掖她、鼓勵她、訓練她、使她成爲一個眞正中國的運動人材、世界的運動人材、爲中國爭光、爲世界發揮、在楊女士本人、也應該怎樣的虚懷若谷、來摒絶一切無聊的應酬、毫無意識的歡迎、抵抗外來的壓力、努力加緊成績上的進步、眞正的向前猛進、否則呢、在歡迎的、愛之適足以害之、前途的流毒、不堪設想、在女士本人、也到了一個終點止境、骨鯁在喉、不得不吐、不知讀者以爲如何、</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>待到太后要茶喝的時候，却仍由他自已端上去，這樣太后當然不會再根問他丁。提起喝茶，我不妨附帶的報告一聲，太后是一個很有研究的「品茶者」。伊所常用的茶葉，也有好幾十種；茉莉和蓮花，祇是最普通的兩種而已，其餘許多，眞是名目繁多，記不勝記，且多是外面所不經見的希品，因此安們的名稱，儘有到此刻還不聽見有人道及的。</p>
<p>這輛車上，雖然分成了四間不同的屋子，但我們的趣味的集中點，當然還是那一座列車上的小朝廷。在這一座小朝廷裏，可以隨意發出不同的號令來，敎這列整齊的列車向前開，或向後退，或停止；不但如此，便是關於中國全部的一切政治上，軍事上，經濟上的種種變動和更調的主動力，丨丨太后的上諭，在這短短的幾天裏，也無一不是打這僅佔半節車廂的小朝廷裏發下去的。</p>
<p>在我們那間休息室和這一座小朝廷的中問，也是同樣的用一排很精緻的木板隔離着，而在這一排木板的上部，另有一個非常莊嚴而富麗的華蓋裝置着，像一柄撑開的傘一般的籠罩在上面。它的　底下，便是太后的御座。在宫中，在頤和園裏，專爲太后所備的御座，多至一二十張，它們的尺寸，都較車上這一張來得高大，可是外觀的形式，却是一般的美麗，並無絲亳上下。這些御座的原料，都是用的最高貴的紫檀木，上面還滿綴着無數的珍珠寶石，到了晚上，元是閃閃地發出耀眼的光來；可是在那座墊上，爲着要求坐的人舒服起見，當然不能再用什麽珠寶，但就是一方單純的杏黃色的絲絨，也已十分奪目了。（一○○）</p>
<h3>文剌史傳</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>剌史姓文、其行世居草澤中，號孑孓者，常嗜人股膚，必飽其腹而後已，去則飛且鳴，其聲若雷，令人通宵不寐，故無不厭之而以姓氏旁加虫字，謚之曰（蚊），蓋深惡之焉；嗣江東有「蚊母鳥」。亦謂之「吐蚊鳥」，善夜鳴，吐蚊子於叢葦間，湖洲尤甚，又有「蚊子樹」，實類楷杷，熟則自裂，蚊盡春秋</p>
<p>而殼空矣，皆其後裔，故其子姓繁衍，一入初夏，恒率其醜類，大張饞吻，吸人膏血，不至體無完膚不止；世有病瘧者，以時寒時熱爲苦，醫家曰，「此蚊之惡作劇也」，投以金雞納，始克之，然治其標，不若治其本，日東有野豬者，自謂能袪之，用其術，則出綠色之盤香，以火燃之，其氣質與火燄上騰，充滿一室，而蚊乃不敢爲入幕之賓、其勢稍殺，會野豬以劣貨名，爲世所屏，三星無敵起而代之，顧蚊之蹤跡，不絶於時常窺伺於臥榻之側，擾人清夢，其晝伏夜動，怙過不悛，斃於手掌中者，不知凡幾；今歲苦旱，蚊寖少矣，而富有者，猶恐其、濳匿，舉飛立脫以搜勦之，竟奏膚功，而以肅清聞。</p>
<p>作者曰，剌史，一官職耳，剌舉不法，督察郡國，昔崑山顧氏亭林嘗論之，蚊乃冒其名，卒爲世患，豈設官者所及料乎？然蚊固微物，饜其欲，嗡嗡然，猶知表其口惠，而芸芸者，日竭其膏脂以獻，且朘削敲剥之唯恐不力，抑又何歟；噫，是殆蚊之不若，蚊於是倜乎遠已。</p>
<h3>冷麵</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>天熱，勞働者吃不起汽水，吃不起冰淇淋，而且汽水冰淇淋祇可解渴，却裝不飽肚。在這塲合，冷麵便成了他們唯一的需要品，雖不能解渴，却也可以冷冷心。丨丨何况還裝得飽肚！「冷麵！冷麵！」清晨在蓆條上醒來，便有一種悠長的聲音在衖裏喊着；房東家裏的孩子最喜歡吃，對面皮帶廠裏的老司務也總有他的份的。有時候我走近窗口去看看，表面上倒也頗爲清潔可觀，綠色的搪磁碗一排六七隻，裏面有醬油，有醋，有辣油，有蔴油，有老薑片……。麵則用白布覆蓋着，六個銅子也可以買一碗，十個銅子也可以買一碗，質量數量雖與銅子的多寡作正比例，但是老主顧是偶或也可以獲得額外的便宜的，就像我所看到的對面的老司務便是一例。</p>
<p>午後，四五點鐘，夏天日長，晚飯的時候還不到，但肚子却餓了。挑冷麵擔的有經騐，總聽得他說：「老司務，五點鐘哉，肚皮餓哇？快來吃冷麵」！當老司務没錢的時候雖也會討個没趣、但什八都是喊得成功的。</p>
<p>聽到冷麵擔悠長的喊聲，我的腦裏總不期然而然的會浮起層回憶：母親是喜吃「冷潔麵」的，只不知今年亢旱過後，鄕間還有「冷潔麵」吃没有？</p>

<p>傳達道；請您别慌，讓我查一查。於是在桌子抽屜裏取出一本傷兵掛號簿子，揭開了書面還不曾翻得一頁，桂枝情不自禁的擠了向前　了眼睛望看。關太太也伸了頭向前望着，呌道；我們孩子的爹他呌關耀武。那便達已經翻着那受傷的連長姓名了。隨口答道：對了。關太太喜得向前，又是一擠道：是他嗎？謝天謝地。他拍着孩子的肩膀道：小牛子，你爸爸可回來啦。傳達向他望了道：你不是姓關嗎？關太太道：是呀！我們姓關呀。傳達道：我是說，有個受傷的連長，這連長可對了，是平安堡來的，他不姓關。田老太太搶着道：是姓田的吧？傳達摇頭道：也不姓田。桂枝本是呆呆的站在一邊聽着，這時聽那受傷連長，旣不姓關，又不姓田，那自然是姓趙了。便道：到底姓什麽，勞駕，請　告訴我們。傳達道：他呌殷得仁，你們認識嗎？這三位老少婦人，面面相覻作聲不得。還是桂枝先開口道：就是殷連長也好，我們得進去問問。田老太太道：他和我兒子同營呢，我們總得問問。那傳達向他們打量了一番，便點着頭道：你三位就是不說，我也明白了。這事我不能作主，等我先去問問大夫。他進去了，復出來道：大夫說：那三位連長，也是替國家出力的，你三位來了，不能不行個方便。可是我們這裏的規矩，探望傷兵，不能同時去這些個人。請這位老太太先去，老太太出來了，關太太再去，這位趙太太就請你隨後一點。好在一個人進去，也不過上十分鐘，等不了多少時候的。桂枝一想，自已最是年輕，這種支配，也很是公平，連說了幾　好字。於是這傳達將他們引進，都讓在候見室裏坐着，先帶了田老太太進去。桂枝坐在候客室的椅子上，低了頭只管看自已的手指甲，並小晚話。關太太却半晌歎一口氣。（四五一）</p>
<h3>我國應急切建設之國防</h3>
<p>— 士英</p>
<h3>菜館門前的鷄</h3>
<p>— 周欣子</p>
<p>每天，每天，早上從那菜館面前走過，每天，每天，在那兒看到一副空的擔子停歇着；離那擔子不遠的地方，蹲伏着一堆被束縳的羣鷄。</p>
<p>它們並不發出任何呌聲，倒也很安寗的團作一處，轉動着眼殊，直溜在一般過路人的身上；眼眶裏雖没有眼涙包含，但，很能勾引人們的憐惜之心。</p>
<p>店堂裏磨刀的聲浪，霍零不停；門前束縳的羣鷄，好似懂得磨刀的來意，怔驚着，一個屠手，手裏拿着雪亮的尖刀，隨手的提了一頭；這時就能聽到它的哀鳴，怪！怪！那屠手是殺鷄不眨眼皮的，在那喉管處，深深的割剌，同時那猩紅的鮮血，就流瀉在預放在檯上的碗裏，兩隻腿拚命的伸挺，挣扎，結果還是遭人的屠殺；臨死的時光，怪！怪！怪！發出最後的哀啼！撲！撲！撲！震着雙翼，作最後的挣扎！</p>
<p>這渺小的畜生！鷄！在它遭人殺戮，臨死的時候，還這樣的啼呌，挣扎；那稱爲萬物之靈的人！遭人的屠殺，該是怎樣的了？難道俯首帖耳的任人屠殺，一些兒没有勇氣，來抵抗，挣扎麽？</p>
<h3>等級</h3>
<p>— （楊餘聲）</p>
<p>夜半，在霞飛路上，看到一列縱隊式的自行車巡邏隊。法國人居首，次爲白俄，再次是安南人，安南人之後是中國人！</p>
<p>這啟示我世界民族中分有這許多等級！</p>
<p>假使在英租界，公共租界，推而至於旅順大連東北四省那幾處地方，英國人日本人可不用說，就是印度人朝鮮人，也得站在中國人前面的！這使我感到有些悵然！但想到世界上還有黑奴和印第安人，他們總得站在中國人後面了吧？</p>
<p>中國人之所以仍能「自豪」，其根據或即在此！</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>北平的平民窟</h3>
<p>— 洪葵</p>
<p>只要對北平稍爲關心的人，他一定會曉得那個平民薈集的繁華塲所是天橋。就遠大一點說，只要你關心些中國下層社會平民的生活情形，那你便不會忽略北平的天橋，因爲北平的天橋確是天下馳名的繁榮的平民窟。</p>
<p>若是把這平民窟細細的分析，正好比上海的遊戲塲，有商販，有雜要，有戲園，有食堂，有窰子浴堂，有測字算命，形形色色，應有盡有，所不同的，它那裏是一片空大的廣塲，全用布幔蓋成一方一方的門類，大大小小，雜七雜八，擠緊在一塊；全塲是近邊，大多數是平民的住宅和販買人肉的窰子，而高樓雅閣即有幾所，也不過是富家翁的堆棧，或是製皮貨的小工廠。遊客們的袋子裏如果没有半個子兒，你也可以去蹓搭蹓搭，可以看到全塲的情形，包你滿意；你如果要裝闊綽一點，使化了五毛大洋，便可以給你逛個痛快。</p>
<p>在這炎夏天氣，猛烈的太陽光攙和着灰沙而飛舞，一般窮光蛋滿臉有黑油油的汗珠，大概他們並不知道熱到一百度以上的這種天氣吧？他們也並不知道這灰沙裏有兇毒的微菌吧？紅衫綠褲小脚叮呀叮呀的大姑娘，一樣掮着小洋傘，抹着汗珠在東張西望；敞懷露肩的江湖術士，隨着鑼鼓的響聲，使勁地在買他的技藝，唱大鼓的阿姐，眯着嬌羞的眼睛，勉强提高了清脆的嗓子，伊們似乎從來没有睡過覺，常常表現着疲倦的形狀；身穿龍袍頭戴高冠的，在觀衆喧譁聲中表露他俏皮獰笑的神情，羊肉擔子和四面雜食舖子裏放送出來的腥臭氣味，一陣陣剌入大衆觀客的鼻門，這在他們，似並不在乎。</p>
<p>此外有角力者，清唱者，舞蹈者，男的女的，他們没有遮陽的蓬帳，而他們却有漆黑的皮膚，任烈日毒辣的薰蒸，任頭上汗珠一顆顆在伊們敷粉的臉上滾流，凝成滋潤的液膏。</p>
<p>白天從十點鐘的辰光起，他們便要打扮起來，到晚上八點鐘止，得到的勞力價格，實在可憐，據說最大的班子僅僅十多個圓頭呀！譬如在一班有十多人分配，不，與其在形式上說分配，母寗切實點說是支配，因爲班主有絶對的剥削權力，在他們中間的男男女女，自有等級的差别啊，怎能將自已應得的平均代價，得到如數的分配呢！那末吾們因之也不能奇怪伊們，在夜間有别種生活的遭遇了。</p>
<p>炎夏的陽光，熱烘烘地晒在他們的頭上，但他們的生活，依舊是在這熱閙的塲所中扎挣，依舊是挨着春夏秋冬的季候，而消磨他們活潑的人生；他們整個的生命，就是建造了這天橋一塊繫榮之地！</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>追證未齊粉麥停拍</p>
<p>粉市現化尚活、期貨因交易所標粉價漲之後、應即追證追證達六七十萬包、一時未能交齊、遂又全日停市、</p>
<p>麥市以粉市停業、情形相同、蓋前日飛升二三角後、以前證金均經逾　、故立即通知經紀人一律交價追證、當日追證未齊、故麥市上下午坸無交易、</p>
<h3>特車麥喊至四元四角</h3>
<p>（現粉）已漲至二元八角半、市上現粉缺少、人心仍在看好、</p>
<p>（現麥）由福新去九千包、行客去三千包、大市高車麥已漲至四元二角、大市麥至四元、比前市又漲二·三角不等、特車麥則又喊至四元三四角云</p>
<p>標粉證金</p>
<h3>每千包增爲七百五十元</h3>
<p>昨日粉所集議、議决自今日起、證金一律每千包爲七百五十元、追證照例徵收、以期安定市面、</p>
<h3>洋客秈欲跌又止</h3>
<p>爲江西　暢辦所提</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、農間因前定西貢又有一船將進口、且有二三船已在途中、不日可到、而内地本街連日暢辦後胃口已足、並無貪辦之意、囤户嫌價高不能再辦、良以日前市價飛升、雖以水旱災影響、然直接轟大市面者則爲囤户也、今囤户停辦之後、且有將謙錢者售出、而新到之西貢並不堅守以待價高、大都隨市脫手、西貢新米貨主願以十二元價全部脫去、因此人心回下、上午市塲上機糙客秈及小絞均回小一二角、午後忽被江西帮與内地續行暢辦、市又逐步回升、近晚小絞米反高於前日最高價、人心又爲向好矣、全日開西貢一號二千包、新十二元、陳十一元、小絞八千包、上午一度小至十元零二三角、下午又繭至十元零五角半、機糙各開五六百包、沙市糙八元二角半、機靖十元零二三角、今日如本客再貪、則市面仍須看好、否則或可站定、惟業外人心、鑒於各省水旱之災、多有到市問訊、並有囤售之活動也、</p>
<h3>河下米反動回小</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源仍　十三四號、（貨共近二千石）、銷塲更呆、作客問津者不多、蓋因兩朝抬轟太足致人心不免稍頓而呈此呆而不化之局、全市做開僅三四百石、故市色猝超下游、若晚稻回落二三角、各厚粳做開旣稀、下降有四五角、杜洋尖等亦帶耿角許、僅隂變元貨乏胃香、尚現秀色、新粳仍屬十一元二角、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地來源十餘號、市上各色去胃依然平淡、市形白粳白元及薄稻平疲、高羊尖加二三角、中次加角外、埠客尖亦加尺許、東新粳定立、</p>
<h3>油豆餅漲風甚熾</h3>
<p>昨日油市漲風仍烈計豆油續漲一元外、花生油亦繼續七角、因産價飛升、來源不多、存底稀薄、故市堅俏、</p>
<p>陳黃豆先漲後定、行情計漲三四角至一二角不等、市勢以中關貨最鮮、昨由廠方辦去穎州豆十四五車、價自三元五角至四角許、九江帮辦去正陽關豆一二車、價爲三元七角半、尚有囤户及本街等採去各豆十一二車、行情請閱市價欄、新豆因來源不接、價更俏、九江城門豆已開四元、漢口六月白開四元二角、共計成交城門豆四百餘包、江橋豆七十六包、柳芳池豆四十二包、首批九江三羊豆到四十六包價開三元九角半、貨品中次、</p>
<p>豆餅因豆價飛騰、致貨户坸喊堅、且辦方看價尚不大、故皆有心思交易、所以續漲三四分云、</p>
<p>紗花</p>
<h3>粉麥漲風波及紗花</h3>
<p>紗市趨堅、漲勢突銳因日來現紗銷路暢達、各帮採辦　續不斷市氣愈趨愈繁、兼之邇來紛麥發現驚人漲風、據一部份云、棉紗或有鬱應之望、於是引起投機商活動做多、因此收盤時漲氣頗激、遠月穿出前次之高峰矣、</p>
<p>金雞買氣密佈</p>
<p>標紗晨初開盤、以美棉微漲五磅音、但塲中市氣絞緊、因上日現紗消息良好、人氣向佳、拍至三三盤市塲上多數議論、謂粉麥市價、運日狂漲、難免激動紗市、有一部份人心、對於棉紗看漲之觀念殊濃、於此買風步　、市價則盤盤上升、據云仍係金融界　買而挺、結果各月漲一元一角至一元六七角、成交統計二萬六千三百包、奎賣出太孚九百五十包、通記八百包、裕康四百五十包、大豐一千八百包、錦昌一千二百包、源大一千二百五十包、益昶九百五十包、長豐一千五十　、愼員一千六百五十包、買進恒益一千三百包、振大一千一百五十包、惠康八百五十包、順大八百五十包、元一八百五十包、泰昌一千一百包、漍康一千包、恒品六百包、德記六百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>長沙　三四五　福建　一０　北帮　八０</p>
<p>棉市盤旋數日、今則漲風益熾、以美棉平疲、而粉麥物價狂漲、引起本埠人心趨堅、一般神經過故者、預料棉花或有劇烈之變化、因此買户蜂擁而來市盤陡漲、但通州帮及源大兩號天量的抛賣、但現棉銷路依然況悶、據某花號友云、目前新棉産狀况、尚能美滿云、</p>
<p>鄭標高漲五角半</p>
<p>標棉晨間開盤、市况驟緊、買氣尤濃、大部份的人心、以粉麥市價飛漲、對於棉花或有同樣漲力之希望、引起散户購買做多、由此檯面一緊、形勢突變、市價愈開愈漲、惟通州帮視該處新棉作年成尚屬良好、大量的抛出、市價略爲壓平、結果各月漲四角至五角半、成交統計九萬五千八百擔、查賣出大孚一萬八千擔、源大一萬五千擔、泰興二千三百擔、賡豐二千三百擔、恒德二千一百擔、元一五千三百擔、益昶一千一百擔、德記一千五百擔、源興昌一千二百擔、買進吉豐一千二百擔、同孚一千擔、大豐一千擔、明德一千一百擔、振大二千五百擔、愼昌一千二百擔、　昶四千五百擔、慣記二千七百擔、長豐三千八百擔、潤賡五千四百擔、大昶八千擔、鴻昌二千二百擔、益豐二千三百擔、長和三千擔、瑞源二千三百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>靜待政府報告之美棉</h3>
<p>昨日美棉因等候政府報告、市况參差不定、後因旱區缺雨及空户抵補而堅、結果現貨漲五磅音、期貨漲二至六磅音、英棉停市、印棉初因投機家買進而堅、後因散户　出而回、結果平果爾及白羅溪漲一羅比七角角、奥姆辣漲一羅比半、原電錄左、（六日電）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>關於大衆語討論中「一個更小的問題」的檢討</h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>在四日的本刋上，載着有阿龍先生的「關於曹先生提出「大衆語的幾個小問題」說幾句話」。雖然阿龍先生是以「封建式的頭腦」，然還像是很誠意的在曹先生提出的幾個題後另提出了一個「更小的問題」來討論。可是，終於因爲也只還是看到了問題的浮面，因此把這個歷史發展上的有着整個社會關係的運動中的一部門曲解了很多的地方。這樣，吾們是得來對阿龍先生把問題加以糾正與判明一下的。</p>
<p>一·在這回由於各種復古運動的興倡與漫延，而文言文與白話文的再起交鋒中，提出了「大衆語」建設問題。在這裏，吾們當然不敢否認在這個論戰中是不會有要「借此出出風頭」的人；然而，在這個問題的提出，也决不會像阿龍先生所說的，儘是那樣「專靠腦筋中的理想」所「創造」出來的。要知道，人類社會中的一切，决不會由你自在地超越了歷史。而這個問題的所以産生與發展，也正由於歷史的客觀的條件所决定：牠是在今日的社會中，爲了生産力與生産關係的予循不斷的發展，而社會日趨於集體化過程上的必然底産物。而且，這個「大衆語」的名詞也正是相對的，而决不是怎麽籠統的，含糊的名詞。「大衆」，正須代表着一般負得了歷史的發展，時代的演進上的使命而可前進的「大衆」，這是吾們須得認清了而不可混亂的。</p>
<p>二·這里不能不說是阿龍先生的很大的悮解：硬說着「大衆語和大衆文有分别討論的必要」。這個在稍留意些文學的人是誰也都知道，關於「大衆文學」並不是在今日才來提出的；遠在數年前早就有過一度的討論與産生的了。然而，牠的所以不能普遍地發展開去，一部份的原因，也正因爲在於所用的文字不是「大衆」的。所以更得有今日所提出的一種爲大衆所說得出，聽得懂的一種口頭語，同時也就是爲大衆所讀得出，寫得下的一種筆頭語。然而，决不像阿龍先生那樣固執地「一種是用口用耳的，一種用手用筆的」唯心論者的說法。雖然這裏是有用口與手的分别，然而這同樣是爲吾們人類要表達思想的二種不同的用法與姿態吧了。並且你怎麽說個代表了言語而寫在紙上的東西，只是用目而不能用口來讀而講的呢？！本來，語和文的所以要分家。最惡意的就是在於一般保守的特殊者層，爲了要表示他的身份，在社會生活進化過程上已成了固凝與僵化的言語中去兜着圈子。而吾們所需要的「大衆語」正須要力避着這種腐弊，同時除了「大衆語文」外、更有着戲劇，電影等都正也需要着「大衆語」呢！</p>
<p>三·當然，誰也不得加以否認：吾們的下層大衆的文化水凖是再低下不過的了。文育佔着有百份之八十又强。然而，在這個「大衆語」的建設，正將成爲最簡易，普及而完備的敎育大衆的一種工具呢。而「大衆語文」的建設和其他部門如大衆語的電影，戲劇等正是相對地提高着大衆文化水準，改進大衆生活的社會運動之一。但决不像阿龍先生那樣說的「須要普及敎育……方有入手辦法」，而變成了一個孤立的，不是有着歷史上根本的社會意識的運動了。並且關於文學，阿龍先生也竟一言抹煞了說着「被幾位智識份子，弄弄筆頭，掉掉槍花……」（在今日的社會中，作着這種勾當的人果然也有）而不看到在客觀的事實上：文學正是人類社會生活的反映，同時得動社會進化的主要條件。</p>
<p>四·關於大衆語建設中的土話與方言的揚棄和發展的問題，各方面討論的很多，在這裏可不必多說了。但是，决不像阿龍先生所說着的「因爲大衆語，便向大衆堆裏去找，眞是築室道謀，三年不成……」那樣極端唯心論者的說法，要知「大衆」决不是像你這樣想的死的東西，正相反，大衆正是動的，活的，前進的社會中的羣衆！而將來的「大衆語」與「文」，非但是要替大衆說話，說大衆的話，向大衆說話，並且更將是大衆自動起來說自已要說的話！</p>
<p>爲了這個「更小的問題」並不怎麽「小」與孤單，又限着篇幅，因此，不能詳加一一討論，然我終望阿龍先生且下得「五里霧」來，暫去了固有的「思想，」來把問題的各面都看得一下再說。</p>

<h3>哭慰農！</h3>
<p>— 悟生</p>
<p>清早起來，到辦公處，接着一個訃文，是慰農的尊人春波先生去世了！我心正爲惴惴，默念吾友此時必然涕泗滂沱，爲老人悲。主欲馳書勸慰，節彼哀懷，詎知事有出人意想不到者在：訃文後翻下去，觸目驚心突然又來一個「訃」字，讀之則「不孝韓以鍾泣告：先君慰農於二十三年七月一日丑時疾終嘉善西塘正寢」寥寥幾行黑字。眞的？吾友慰農，離開人世征途長逝了？</p>
<p>唉！吾復何言？只有飲泣流涙而已！</p>
<p>慰農一字「天字」，亦號「韋拔」，在本刋上曾化過許多心血。他的文章頗能抓住時代重心，如「中國國民有幾個？」「何以對韓人？」「斷水糾紛」，「彌縫政策」，「人類的惰心」，「没落者」，等幾篇，俱能痛擊時艱，淋漓揮發。而留我個人腦筋中印象最深者則爲滬戰後「薦頭店裏」的一篇。如：</p>
<p>飯後，照例的坐着談天。今天又新添了資料，話自然集中於這新來的兩人身上。</p>
<p>「嫂子」，你貴姓！家是那裏？」在許多候補者中，最愛說話而又住得最久的那個老婦人問。</p>
<p>「我姓王，夫家姓張，家在瀏河的鄕下。那新來的年輕婦人答。</p>
<p>「澳，是今年十九路軍和敵人打得最厲害的地方，是不是？」那老婦似記了這血淋淋的歷史說。</p>
<p>「可不是麽？可不是那可惡的敵人打來，我也何至於到這裏來！」那少婦說着，有點黯了。「我家一向在鄕下種田，原是好端端的一家人家。給敵人這一擾，唉，人雖逃出了，可是屋子及一切家用東西，統統給砲火燬了。又那裏來的錢來種田呢？天是不原諒人的，接着我男人又氣出一塲病來。唉，一切的家用都没有，我那能不丢了我初生的孩子來做奶媽呢？可憐我那雖只幾個月的小孩，生得却比城裏官官肥胖。現在給了人家，只好聽天由命吧！個人生活都難，那裏還顧得到小孩呢！一那少婦雖然說得很達觀，但聲音已有些顫了。</p>
<p>「唉，眞可憐的身世！」許多人說。由出賣勞力競爭上所生的嫉妒，却已化作同情。……</p>
<p>像這種材料的描寫，在現階段是非常需要的，而且是非常珍貴的。</p>
<p>慰農當成年時代，曾做過幾年商店學徒，後來竭力挣扎，勉强進入無錫國專補讀。離國專後就是流浪，直至前年冬天才進某書局編輯部做事。像他這種努力苦學，虚心下問的精神，很可以做我們勞苦青年的模楷。他如私生活的質樸無華，待人接物的和藹可親，亦是目前青年界中之所不可多得。他的性情，很接近俄國的托爾斯泰，多消極而少積極，常勸他父親少去徵收田租，處處表現慈愛胸懷。惜乎！天不假年，這樣中年逝世，時代車夫中又缺少了一個得力的「同路人」！</p>
<p>回憶去年今日，我們兩人同住在華德路。自燒飯，自滌衣，青茄共辣，盃酒同乾，飄飄乎作出塵世之想念。嗣則我因職務所覊，離東遷西，然每週過叙，猶多時機；迨至今年上春，君受書局之遣，供職蘇州，會面之期遂告阻隔，誰會料及今春一别竟成了我們的永别呢？</p>
<p>在今春蕭蕭細雨的一個黃昏，慰農寫過他細雨懷人的短文，内有幾句說：「在這凄凉的環境裏，會使你想起無窮的往事，與遠方朋友的懷念。我記了在獄中的珊，記起了生死不明的愉，記起了飄泊濟南道上的薌……」今則慰農死矣！獄中的珊，生死不明的愉，濟南道上的薌，以皮本刋散聚離合的同文，得知了這個不願聞的消息時，將繼我而作若何感想乎？</p>
<h3>十年</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>丨懷念着死去的父親</p>
<p>十年，是一個很可紀念的一個數目，眞的，在數目的推算上，牠是那樣的整齊，而在年限上，牠又是不過久也不過暫的。</p>
<p>一想到十年，一想到十年裏所遭受過的事件，不自主的，我就會發呆，甚至會呆得失去了暫時的知覺。實在，十年對於我的剌激太大了，太大了，雖則說那只是小小地，短短地一瞥，然而，汹湧的波濤在冲擊着，狂暴的風雨在襲打着：這，這，漂泊着的命運呵！</p>
<p>命運，是彼此不會相同的，這，就和人的面貌不會相同一樣。挽救嗎？據說也是不可能的，自然，這話的對象，是對於下層的人們的，至於上層，那，恐怕又當論的。</p>
<p>值得感謝的，是十年前的現在，我就在這樣的時候，父親病了，來勢是那樣的凶猛，惡劣，使家中的人們都在打着寒禁。但是，寒噤是没有用的，牠不會因了這而卽喪失了那已成的威力，相反的，牠却在逐漸的增加，增加，使整個的軀幹有火一樣的燙。</p>
<p>當然，這是非治不可的，雖是很明白自已，在力量上是不够的，不，簡直的是缺乏，但，一個以人混飯的家庭，不治？那前途，那渺茫的前途，是如何的可惶呵！</p>
<p>治了，終於治了，第一件，錢！第二件，錢！第三件，仍舊的是錢！有了錢，什末事都好做的。一提到錢，我們就頭痛，眞的，没有恒産，以人謀生的人旣然病倒了，錢，又從那裏滋生呢？已經有了比較相當的年齡，這就是說，在知覺上，已經有了相當的記憶力。</p>
<p>那是暮春三月的天氣，在北方，正在絢爛的一個時期，假使走出了古老的城樓，對着溶解了的護城河站望着，眼前：那蒼茫的一片草青，那飛舞的對對蛺蝶，那臨流的摇頭楊柳，還有，那早熟的無際麥田呵，這些，都是具有另一種風趣的。</p>
<p>唯一的辦法，只有當，只有賣，也祇有這兩樣才是無上的救星，但是，當？賣？當什麽呢？賣什麽呢？每月的薪餉勉强的能維持着生活，又那裏有餘裕製備着物件以爲日後的當賣呢？</p>
<p>窮愁，憂鬱，在交迫着，煎逼着。呵，拉開了臉吧！向熟識的朋友告貸吧！</p>
<p>一個月後，病，更重了，重了，許多的人在商量着後事，不用說，惶恐和焦急同時的咬着我們的心。終於，終於，這命運是不可挽救的了，該是多麽慘痛喲！父親竟辭别了我們去了！去了，在一個永遠不能泥滅的早上。</p>
<p>這，或者也是你意想得到的吧？我們在漂泊了，漂泊了，這裏，那裏。像一片流雲，像一個風力、也像一拘浪花，無定的，止着，走着，在嚴寒，也在暑夏，唉，沙漠中的旅途　！</p>
<p>苦的，酸的，以至於辣的，鹹的，這些，都　逼了，嚐逼了，没嚐過的，是甜的美味呵！</p>
<p>時間，竟跑得這樣快，一轉眼已經十年了，雖說那是小小地，短短地，但在演進上，畢竟是有着一段相當的時日呵！</p>

<h3>蘇聯青年的飛行游戲（中）</h3>
<p>— （莫斯科通訊）（引沅）</p>
<p>（二）帶傘跳落學校</p>
<p>蘇聯的航空化學恊會，在莫斯科近郊一個村裏開辦一所「帶傘跳落學校。」在那邊每逢天氣清朗的日子，我們可以看見一種壯麗的帶傘跳落的表演。</p>
<p>這種新式遊戲，現在日益普遍化，並且受學的人數也與日俱增。當一二年前還没有十個帶傘跳落者的時候，這種遊戲很少有人知道；現今已經變成蘇聯一種羣衆的遊戲。這樣的成績當然要歸功於這航空化學恊會學校及其創辦者和領導者莫希考夫斯基。去年二月間，莫氏（他自已是一個航行者，帶傘跳落者）與其二個同事創辦這個學校。從此以後，幾千個人已經從這個學校畢業了，並且得到帶傘跳落者的稱號。他們大都已經歷過幾十次的跳落，並有幾百個人，皆已成爲指導員。</p>
<p>很少有帶傘跳落者，臨其首次嘗試時感到害怕的，因爲這種跳落是需要大膽的人纔能允許他表演。莫氏在這方面，已經成立一種紀錄，他總共跳過一百零一次，他的二個同事，每人也都跳過大約有七八十次。</p>
<p>莫氏的成功，有賴於他能完全控制其神經，這是每個帶傘跳落者的第一要素，因爲在張開下落傘時失之太遲或太早，就有致命的危險。所以必需先控制其神經。</p>
<p>這個學校的學習期限只定十天，在學習期内，學生學會裝置和解放這下落傘，並授以各種降落的學理。校内的敎練，非常優良，所以跳落雖是危險，但在這個學校的生活史上，從没有一次死亡或傷害。</p>
<p>現在，又是仲夏的時候了，實在，這是出於我的意外的，無論如何，也没有想到漂落在江南。自然，江南是負有勝名的，在風趣上是不能與北方比擬的，然而，在今天，當我站在那黃浦江邊，當江裏的水冲擊着，當點點的帆影跳進了我的臉前時，我想到這，正是你辭别了我們的日子喲！</p>
<p>永遠的，我不能忘記那囑咐的話，那，是有力量的，在震撼着我的耳膜，請寛釋了不安的心情吧。</p>
<p>在這裏，謹以至敬，祝你的精神永久的照臨。</p>

<h3>身居異地</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個天眞的孩子，暑期裏從小學内出來，就被捲入了這個萬惡的社會</p>
<p>現在我住在海上，距離故鄕，不下五六百里路，没有遠離家庭的我，日常生活的一切丨丨無論衣食住行丨丨素來仰靠我的慈母照拂，現在却使我身居異地，孤苦零丁，怎不使我時感悲傷呢！有時，竟會抛起涙珠，鳴咽地哭着，但是誰能知道我所衷曲呢？</p>
<p>前日，又是月圓時分的夜呀！我瞧着空庭中的月光，呆了，呆得出神了。月亮中那不是娑婆樹嗎？樹上還有一個人在那裏鋸着牠呢！聽說：始終鋸不斷的。忽兒，似乎變了兩只兎子，在那裏禮拜着月宫，聽說：這兎子是月宫之兎，已成仙的了…………還有其餘…………這，我都記得，是從小我的媽媽和我常講的故事，把這些話常當乘凉的消夏品，所以，在這夏天月圓之晚，更容易使我憶起我幼年的一切。</p>
<p>我不覺時間的奔馳，祗是望着，瞧着。不久遠隱，約的聽到江海關上的鐘聲，呤呤呤的打下去，我知道時候不早了，明天又一早又要起來，因此就跑進屋去就寢。</p>
<p>當卸衣之後，電火熄了，月光仍是從窗欞裏映到床邊，此時更使我轉輾不寐，想，更想着，倘若在家裏時，這時一定還在母親的身邊睡呢！我爬了起來，仍舊開了電燈，試問這時刻的我，誰來安慰我呢？我寂寞，更悽凉，生出無限的悲切，在這良宵月夜的我，尤其是我這小孩呀，怎叹能把我這思念美麗憇密的故里可以丢開去呢？</p>
<p>先生！請你解答我吧！我是永遠感激不盡的敬請</p>
<p>撰安　　剣明鞠躬</p>
<p>答：一個人　旅居外鄕，都免不了要想家的，何况你年齡很輕，一向没有離開過母親一刻，觸景生情，自然更容易感覺寂寞淒凉了。但是我希望你不必悲傷，也不必着急，因爲作客他鄕是人所不免的，而旅居生活過慣了也就不覺其苦了。</p>
<p>「想家」的主要原因有二，生活上無人照料，和精神上缺乏安慰。在家時候，衣食住樣樣都不要你管，現在却非你自已去料理不可。初做這些生活上的瑣事，總是感覺到麻煩，並且做也做不好决無慈母代你照料得妥貼周到。不過我却希望你不要因爲乏人照料，就不去做這些瑣事，或者自已悲傷，不論在家裏在外邊，自已總是應該照料自已，不應該一味依靠旁人的。將來這些瑣事做慣了，不但可以减少「想家」的痛苦，並且還可以養成你獨立勤快的精神。而且，煩惱，悉悶，與間暇大有關係。你不要是間着没事，恐怕也不會對月生愁。所以多尋事做是驅愁的一個妙法。你遇到煩悶來侵襲你的時候，就趕緊找些事做，你可以寫信把你抑鬱發洩出去，你可以找朋友談天，下棋，把間愁忘了。這方法是很合實用的，你那天望着月滿腹牢騷，但是你在寫完信後，我想，比後你也許就不悲哀了。是不是？</p>

<h3>呆子</h3>
<p>— 林彬</p>
<p>昨夜又夢見呆子血淋淋地在街上滾，又使我想起這慘痛的往事。不知怎的，牠給我的印象會這麽深！</p>
<p>說起來，我眞是個硬心腸的人！我曾目睹過有人拿雪白的熱饅頭濺着剛過鐵的人頭的鮮血吃着；目睹過中了開花彈的四分五裂血肉模糊的小兵屍體堆在車站上。這種種觸目驚心的慘象，也不過使我歎一聲一人類多麽殘忍呀！」就完事了。腦子裏所留下的印象，眞像激流中的樹葉，立刻就無影無踪地消逝了。獨有這段有些人認爲很平常的往事，却如萬鈞的石塊重壓着我的心胸，使我三翻兩次做着血腥的惡夢！</p>
<p>是秋末冬初的時節，一個古怪的異鄕人突然出現在我們的村中。他那種似浮滑又似僕實，說快樂又似悲哀的音容笑貌，帶着充分色情狂的言談舉動，立時獲得「呆子」的稱號，像發現了無價的活寶似地轟動了全村。</p>
<p>他夜間伴着三尊塵封的菩薩，在離村二三里路外的一所早就斷了香火的古廟中住宿，白天就隨着朝陽來到村裏做求乞的浪人。不管在街道上，樓窗上，大門前，天井中，他　一看見年輕的婦女，紫醬色的毛臉立刻浮起嚇人的獰笑，兩眼滑油油地放光，厚笨的雙唇裂了開來，露出一排塗滿了牙糊的黃牙，發出像敲着破竹筒似的粗嗄的聲音：「眞好看，眞好看哪！」</p>
<p>當肚子嘰哩咕嚕地響得難熬而去挨户求乞的時侯，他就受到各種不同的待遇。有些人家像提防洪水猛獸似的關了灶間門，不睬他。有些則在飯桌上響着沉重的拳頭，送出大聲的喝：「走，走，不走剥了你的皮！」有時爲了呆子的執拗而賞他幾個耳光，把他拖出大門。但大部份人家却故意讓他等在門口，逗他說笑話，笑話的代價，自然是一些預備喂猪鑼的酸臭哼天的殘羹。</p>

<h3>Setting Sail for Xun Today by Ship</h3>
<p>To Discuss Matters with Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>To Give Instructions to the Military Officer Training Corps</p>
<p>Yin Tong Visited Wang Yesterday Morning Presenting a Letter in Huang Fu's Own Handwriting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang is scheduled to attend the Central Political Conference on the 8th and then take the Hai Rong warship to Xun, before proceeding to Lu, to give instructions to the military officer training corps. The Navy Department has already ordered the Hai Rong warship to dock in the Jiangxin (river center) area of Xiaguan, with fires lit in preparation for departure. Navy Commander Chen Shaokuan, Tie Cizeng, and Zhong Ming will all accompany him. It is said that after Wang arrives in Lu, he will stay for two or three days to visit Chairman Lin, report on the political situation, and also discuss matters with Chairman Chiang. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the original ship on the 12th. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has already arranged with Wang to fly to Xun from Shanghai by plane on the 8th. If his official duties in Shanghai are not completed, then he will definitely be able to make the trip on the 9th. As for the President of the Examination Yuan, Dai Chuanxian, because the date of his instructions has been postponed to after the 10th, the date of his trip to Lu has not yet been determined. Tang Youren said that President Wang plans to attend the Central Political Conference on the 8th and then take a warship from the Navy Department to Xun, before proceeding to Lu, to give instructions to the military officer training corps. The accompanying personnel will generally be two or three people. Yin Tong, the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, will stay in Nanjing for two or three days before returning to Ping. He visited me this morning, and the discussions were all about ordinary matters. Chairman Huang will go down the mountain within the next few days and will first go to Gan to meet with Chiang and Wang, and then go north. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong, the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, went to President Wang's official residence in the Railway Department at 10:00 a.m. on the 7th to present a letter in Chairman Huang's own handwriting and to state that Huang was grateful for the Central Government's diligent supervision and would return north immediately after seeking instructions. According to Yin's statement, his visit to Wang today was solely for reporting matters and did not involve any other issues. Wang also did not express any opinions on the various points decided upon during the Dalian conference. There is no definite date for when Chairman Huang will come to Nanjing. Whether he will go to Lu or directly to Ping is not yet certain; he is currently waiting for Chairman Huang to come to Nanjing before making a decision. Yin also stated that the seven measures agreed upon at the Dalian conference were originally individual, unrelated events. If they are implemented individually, there should not be much difficulty. The urgency of resolving the issue of reorganizing the war zone is also due to this. He continued, regarding the operational status of the Beining Railway after its reopening, because he is still in a state of resignation, he has not yet gone to the bureau, and the details are unknown. However, he understands that the number of passengers traveling to and fro is still quite large. As for the China Travel Service's undertaking of the transportation business after the reopening, it was entrusted by the government, and there has been no news of any losses so far. Even if there are losses, because it was entrusted by the government, it has been stated that the Beining Railway Bureau will provide subsidies. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong also discussed that the issue of abolishing the Tanggu Truce was not mentioned in the Dalian talks. In his personal opinion, one should focus on practicality. The existence of the Tanggu Truce is a matter of timeliness. If the disputes in the war zone are completely eliminated, it will be abolished naturally. Otherwise, merely pursuing superficial victory is actually equivalent to zero. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Warships Arrive at Qin Island</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Four British submarines and one torpedo boat arrived at Qinhuangdao from the Weihaiwei area on the morning of the 6th. The torpedo boat sailed to Beidaihe in the afternoon. The submarines opened beside the Luanzhou coal unloading wharf, with four boats moored. In the afternoon, the crew marched through the city streets for an hour to show their force, before returning to the boats. The British flagship HMS Folkestone and the cruiser HMS Adventure and gunboat HMS Foremost, anchored in the port, had sailed to the Beidaihe waters on the afternoon of the 6th. On the 6th, a French cruiser arrived at Qinhuangdao from Shanghai, but because there were too many British and Japanese ships docked in the port, it only stayed briefly before sailing to Beidaihe. The British Naval Admiral returned to Qinhuangdao from Shanhaiguan on the morning of the 6th. Currently, there are a total of six British submarines and cruisers, and six Japanese cruisers and destroyers anchored in the port, making the port quite crowded. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the issue of British troops conducting target practice in Yuguan, the Japanese believe that it is the boundary of the puppet state and prohibit the exercise, while the British base their position on the Boxer Protocol. The two sides are in dispute and have not yet resolved the matter. However, both sides currently deny the claim that a British soldier was killed by a Japanese stray bullet. They sent a letter to the local Western newspapers in this city on the 6th to make a correction. (7th Central Telegram)</p>
<h3>Shenyang is Heavily Guarded</h3>

Seven businesses near the west gate caught fire. The righteous army fought fiercely until 2:00 a.m. on the 6th before retreating towards Xinmin. Afterwards, the Japanese military police launched a large-scale search, and martial law was imposed throughout the city. Thirty-two Chinese and three Koreans were arrested and accused of being members of the righteous army. Currently, Shenyang is heavily guarded by military police, and inspections of people entering and exiting the city are extremely strict. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Funds for the Mongolian Political Council are Unsourced</h3>

Previously, a request was made to the central government to prepare a month's expenses of 30,000 yuan, and Commissioner Yong of the Tumed Banner was assigned to escort the funds back to the temple. The financial department of the Mongolian Political Council is now planning a financial plan. In addition to the monthly allocation of 30,000 yuan from the central government, in the future, it is planned to collect light taxes from the affiliated leagues and banners, estimated to yield 2 million yuan annually. This plan, as well as the method of tax allocation, must be submitted to the Office of the Chief Supervisor for approval before it can be implemented.

<h3>Bandits Discovered Nearby</h3>

The bandit leader, surnamed Wang, claims to be the commander-in-chief of the pseudo-autonomous army and has established a pseudo-military flag. He is equipped with various types of firearms, including machine guns and mountain guns. The bandits have built a camp in the gully, disguised as villagers, and sent informants to various villages. Whenever they encounter wealthy households that can be kidnapped, they take advantage of the lack of police force to commit robbery. Villagers in nearby bandit dens, such as Yangzhuang, Gulouzhuang, Shanggezhuang, and Xiaogangzhuang, dare not go out during the day. Outside the villages, they are rushing to build fortresses and unite to defend themselves. There are also sham titles such as staff officers and secretaries among the bandits, making their momentum quite large.

<h3>On the Anglo-American Joint Restraint of Japan's Arrogance</h3>
<p>Japan, under the guise of maintaining peace, is actually trying to dominate the Far East. The first to bear the brunt of this is our country. However, the effects are also shaking the British market at its very foundation, forcing them to gradually reduce the scope of their past operations. The United States has long had grand plans for economic development in the Far East. However, since the September 18th Incident, its advocated Open Door Policy and Equal Opportunity Policy have been replaced by Japan's Closed Door Policy and Monopoly. Japan, utilizing its geographical advantages and relying on its military strength, is taking every inch it can get, and its desires are exceedingly extravagant. Now that it has already obtained Manchuria and Jehol, it is again trying to lay its hands on North China. Both Britain and the United States are caught in the situation and dare not intervene with force. Therefore, although rumors of an Anglo-American alliance to restrain Japan have been circulating for some time, its outline only gradually became clear after the preparatory talks for the naval disarmament conference came to a standstill. Whether or not this matter will come to fruition remains to be seen in the future.</p>
<p>Let us first analyze the general situation to clarify the relationship between Britain and the United States towards Japan. Japan's destruction of international credibility and tearing up of the Washington Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact are already well known to the world. However, first Britain shirked its responsibility to the League of Nations, and the United States was constrained by the recovery movement. Both countries watched each other and were unwilling to make strong claims. As a result, the Japanese further utilized their local superior position to attempt a complete monopoly of the Far East. Only when the Japanese plan was gradually realized did Britain and the United States become alarmed and urgently seek to unite in order to reverse the downward trend. This is one reason. In recent years, the Japanese government has been chanting the tune of "Extraordinary Times," while making every effort to increase military budgets and develop various industries related to the military, and at the same time striving to open up overseas markets and implement a policy of social dumping. From Hong Kong, Singapore, and India to South Africa, Egypt, Europe, Australia, Canada, and South American countries, they generally feel the impact of Japanese goods dumping. Even Britain, old in business, keenly feels the difficulty of dealing with this rising powerful enemy. As a result, they cannot help but think of uniting with the United States to stop it. This is another reason. Before the expiration of the London Naval Treaty in 1936, the issue of arms reduction should naturally be planned for resolution. Although the British and American sides hold different opinions on technical discussions, they are quite united in their proposal to add political issues to the future conference table. However, Japan insists on dissenting. The reason is that without discussing political issues, the shameful history of Manchuria and the mandated islands of the South Seas can be ignored. Not only that, Japan has also put forward the theory of equal ratios in order to expand its strength. Judging from the Japanese attitude of toughness, the fate of the Philippines after independence can already be seen as pessimistic. As for the tiny island of Guam, it is even less able to withstand a single blow from the Japanese. Even if the US Navy can retreat to Hawaii to consolidate its western gateway, it will inevitably be one step behind. Therefore, the United States is also eager to unite with Britain to strive to maintain the balance of power in the Pacific. This is a third reason. Moreover, Britain and the United States have historical ties of common language and race. The British autonomous colonies are particularly fond of the United States. In view of the future crisis, the two countries recall their past friendship and are not impossible to join hands in the Far East. This is a fourth reason.</p>
<p>However, today's advanced countries are mostly based on capitalism, and the development of capitalism must tend towards monopoly. Britain and the United States have always been giants in this regard, but as two tigers cannot share the same mountain, it is the trend of the times. After the Great War, the power of gold dominated the world, and Britain had to retreat to second place. However, since the economic panic of 1929, the United States has been affected by overproduction and has declined after reaching its peak. Until recently, it has not been able to fully recover. On the contrary, the economic alliance movement within the British Empire has gradually taken effect. The struggle for overseas markets is also extremely fierce and unwilling to give in. For example, in a corner of South America, both Britain and the United States are promoting the expansion of their economic strength. Their goals for transportation, investment, and general industries are all monopoly. In addition, such as oil competition, whether it is the development of production areas or the division of markets, there is very little room for coordination. Therefore, observing from the national spirit of capitalist countries, we cannot help but feel that although the Anglo-American alliance is theoretically possible, there are still many obstacles in terms of actual interests. If Japan takes advantage of this weakness and tries to separate the two countries from the united front against Japan, the future situation is still unknown.</p>
<p>Once Japan's Continental Policy Succeeds</p>
<h3>Cherishing Evils Only Augments Troubles</h3>
<p>Observations of the British Liberal Party Leader</p>
<p>A Great War Will Erupt in Ten Years</p>
<p>(Paris) British Liberal Party leader David Lloyd George told reporters from the Parisian newspaper Micro today that he would guarantee that countries would not have to worry about another world war within ten years. Germany is currently unable to fight. Although there is currently a psychological state necessary for war, material facts must also be taken into account. During the Great War, he was the Prime Minister of the British government, so he knows deeply how difficult it is to fight a war. Lloyd George also stated that the powers allowing Japan to do whatever it wants in Manchuria is tantamount to encouraging German militarism. (Reuters telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>Progress of the Eastern European Pact</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The work of establishing the Eastern Locarno Treaty, centered on Russia, France, and Britain, with the aim of ensuring the safety of the Baltic countries and providing them with assistance, is now progressing. This treaty is designed to maintain the status quo in Europe. However, how Germany will react to this is particularly noteworthy. As for Japan's view, the content of this treaty stipulates that when a contracting party is attacked by another country, the other treaty countries will provide assistance within the scope stipulated by the League of Nations. Whether this can be achieved depends on Germany's actions, which is highly questionable. If it is established, the Soviet Union will have security guarantees on its western border, or take active actions on its Far Eastern border. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is monitoring this. (Dentsu telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>The Japanese Military Actively Advocates</p>
<h3>Consolidating Control Over the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Diplomatic and Administrative Authority Transferred to the Ambassador to Manchuria</p>
<p>The Puppet State and Kwantung Are Virtually Merged</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The specific measures of the military authorities regarding the reform of the institutions stationed in Manchuria are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The foundation of the institutions stationed in Manchuria is the abolition of the posts of Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Commander-in-Chief of the Army as one, and the abolition of the Governor of Kwantung, and the establishment of a new Governor of Kwantung, who will be solely responsible for administrative affairs within the Kwantung Leased Territory.</p>
<p>(2) The Ambassador Plenipotentiary is placed under the Prime Minister. The Minister of Foreign Affairs supervises diplomatic affairs. Other administrative matters such as police power and taxation power are all under the jurisdiction of the Ambassador Plenipotentiary. The embassy will establish a General Affairs Office, Police Department, and Foreign Affairs Department to supervise the Governor of Kwantung and the South Manchuria Railway Company and implement diplomatic and administrative affairs.</p>
<p>(3) In order to realize the economic alliance between Japan and Manchuria, a new Economic Conference will be established to study various concrete proposals, and the Prime Minister will supervise the implementation of its affairs.</p>
<p>(4) When extraterritoriality is abolished in the future, the name of the Gendarmerie Commander will be changed.</p>
<p>(5) The issue of abolishing the Colonial Affairs Ministry is not strongly advocated, but the Colonial Affairs Ministry's right to speak on Manchuria will naturally be cancelled. (United Japan Press telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The on-site proposal brought by Counselor Tani of the Army regarding the reform of the administrative organs in Manchuria, and the proposal of the Colonial Affairs Ministry to retain the right to speak on the implementation of policies towards Manchuria in what form, have different contents. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' proposal to coordinate these three proposals advocates gradual reform, with the biggest goal of not damaging the independence of "Manchukuo". That is, it expresses approval in principle of the Army's proposal, but disagrees with the structure of the administrative organs themselves, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Placing the Kwantung Leased Territory under the authority of the Ambassador to Manchuria means transferring the administrative power within the territory of one's own country to the ambassador sent to an independent country, which fundamentally means that the independence of "Manchukuo" no longer exists. Therefore, the Colonial Affairs Ministry should not be deprived of the right to speak and administrative power on the Manchuria issue. The Kwantung Leased Territory should be placed under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Colonial Affairs and independent of the jurisdiction of the Ambassador to Manchuria, recognizing the jurisdiction of the Minister of Colonial Affairs. This is appropriate.</p>
<p>(2) The Army's proposal that the Ambassador to Manchuria recognize the dual supervision of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs on diplomatic administration. However, the Ambassador's administrative power is temporary, and the diplomatic organs will inevitably be streamlined in the future. Therefore, this supervision should be unified under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Dentsu telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of reforming the institutions in Manchuria, the abolition of the Colonial Affairs Ministry has also become a problem. However, the views of the military leaders are that Manchuria is not a colony, but an independent country. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to approach "Manchukuo" with the colonization policy that is the main duty of the Colonial Affairs Ministry. Moreover, the South Manchuria Railway and other special companies in Manchuria are the entities for the empire's development in Manchuria. If their control and supervision are managed by one ministry, the Colonial Affairs Ministry, then judging from the importance of the Manchuria issue, the spirit of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, and the special nature of Japan-Manchukuo relations, this is impossible. Therefore, from this point of view, it advocates that the Colonial Affairs Ministry stop its unitary supervision and control over Manchuria and transfer it to the Prime Minister. As a result, whether the Colonial Affairs Ministry is abolished or not is completely irrelevant to the Army. (Dentsu telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Konoe Advises Okada</p>
<h3>Adjusting Japan-US Relations</h3>
<p>Current Diplomacy Is Difficult to Achieve Results</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Prince Konoe, President of the House of Peers, who returned from the United States, based on the opinions exchanged with famous Americans on various issues, informally drafted a memorandum on Japan-US issues and distributed it today to Prime Minister Okada, cabinet members, and members of both houses of the Diet. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Immigration Ban: The US crackdown method is different from other issues and will soon be resolved in the same way as the Philippines independence issue. How it is resolved will have a major impact on the Japanese psyche. Therefore, from this point of view, it is also advisable to actively resolve it to promote Japan-US friendship.</p>
<p>(2) Japan-US Economic Relations: Japanese economic expansion is regarded by American industrialists as a dumping policy, but very few are regarded as general dumping. Also, since the two countries have a mutually complementary relationship, there is no competition. Therefore, the industrial relations between the two countries can be fully adjusted. American experts advocate that industries that are not suitable for their own country should not be forced to implement a policy of industrial self-sufficiency. They should mutually seek to control trade and cite the actual examples of "our flour industry and their silk weaving industry." Therefore, what kind of hints should be received for the facilities established for the economic relations between Japan and the United States from this point?</p>
<p>(3) Manchuria Issue: It is regarded by Japan as destroying the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, it observes the accomplished fact of the so-called Stimson Doctrine, but there is no atmosphere of advancing in accordance with the law to recognize it. Only a powerful person said that if the current state of affairs continues, the naval issue and the maintenance of peace in the Pacific will face major obstacles, so it should be recognized. This can be noted that the state of affairs of adhering to the Stimson Doctrine seems not to know that it is an obstacle to peace, resulting in a greater psychological distance. Therefore, the first step in Japan's recognition of its Far Eastern policy should be to recognize "Manchukuo." Japan-US friendly negotiations should be limited to recognizing "Manchukuo," but should not involve the China issue to cause suspicion.</p>
<p>(4) China Policy Issue: The Amau Doctrine caused a setback in the tendency for Japan-US friendship that began with the exchange of documents between Hirota and Hull, causing all of Japan to obtain an exclusive monopoly in China. What American public opinion pays attention to is not only Japan's actions in Manchuria, but also future trends in China. Therefore, it is hoped that the limits of Japan's China policy will be clarified and that cooperation will be provided to aid China's economy. However, the middle class and intellectuals believe that the Lachman report on China's economic assistance is appropriate and only advise Japan to cooperate. Therefore, there is a strong feeling that more efforts are needed to thoroughly understand Japan's view of China.</p>
<p>(5) Naval Issue: The United States unanimously believes that Japan's demands are to demand absolute equality in total tonnage and by ship type. Based on this premise, it opposes Japan's demand for the abolition of ratios. Regarding this point, it is answered that although the demand for equal rights is theoretically equal, when the details of the policy have not been announced, it is believed that the result is the same as obtaining absolute equal rights in a few years. If 5:5:5 is recognized, Japan's position in the Far East will be even more dominant. Moreover, the current ratio is based on the Four-Power Treaty and other defensive agreements. Therefore, such agreements must be revised. The status of each type of warship in national defense, that is, its offensiveness and defensiveness, is not particularly insightful except for experts. The same is true for discussions on the usefulness and defensiveness of other battleships and aircraft carriers. What is noteworthy is what policy should be used for discussion so as not to cause the collapse of arms reduction. They believe that the ratio issue should be put aside for the time being and that countries should mutually show the necessary warship construction policies and discuss them with these as the center. Therefore, this view seems to be due to the necessity of national defense and financial requirements, which ultimately leads to a new ratio.</p>
<p>(6) What is surprising is that American public opinion deeply believes in the principles of the Washington Conference and subsequent international peace conferences. Regarding the Manchuria issue, it criticizes Japan's attitude and says that before Japan and the United States conclude a new agreement, Japan must clearly indicate to the Americans the new principles of Far Eastern peace that conform to reality, otherwise it will not believe in the principles of the past. In this situation, it may be difficult for Japan and the United States to conclude a new diplomatic agreement. At this time, the only effect that can be expected is to change the opinions of powerful politicians in American public opinion and reach the opinion that some kind of agreement must be concluded with Japan. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve results from the scope and methods of past diplomatic work.</p>
<p>(7) Japan-Russia Relations: The American side sympathizes with Japan's military strategic position, but the Soviet Union's peace propaganda has had considerable success, so attention must be paid. (Dentsu telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>101-Gun Salute</p>
<h3>Hindenburg Buried in Tannenberg</h3>
<p>Hero Resting in Peace Beneath the General's Tower</p>
<p>Commemorating the Great Victory Over the Russian Army</p>
<p>Hitler Reads Eulogy Praising His Achievements</p>
<p>The remains of President Hindenburg were escorted by troops to the Tannenberg Memorial this morning. The memorial is surrounded by an octagonal wall, with tall pillars at each corner, commemorating Hindenburg's great victory over the Russian army. After Hindenburg's remains arrived here, they were slowly greeted by another army to the inside of the memorial, and then placed on a catafalque. In front of the catafalque was an altar with a cross on it. Hitler read the eulogy here. Hindenburg's coffin departed from Neudeck last night and arrived in Tannenberg. The procession was magnificent beyond compare. Soldiers holding torches lined up on both sides, a rare sight in German history. Hindenburg's remains were placed on a gun carriage in the black night and escorted by an honor guard selected from the troops led by Hindenburg. When it reached the summit of the Fröttner Mountain, it paused for two minutes to commemorate the late President commanding the German army to annihilate the Russian army on this mountain. Hitler flew to East Prussia yesterday afternoon. General Göring, who flew from Berlin to Neudeck, presented a red, white, and black wreath and placed it on the President's coffin. Banks and shops were closed today during the burial. (National News Agency telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>When Hindenburg's remains were buried, a 101-gun salute was fired. This was the honor given to the King of Prussia. Hindenburg was the first person to receive this honor since 1928, and the military parade was the grandest since the Great War, reminding people of the military might of pre-war Germany. (National News Agency telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>The coffin of President Hindenburg of Tannenberg was transported here at six o'clock this morning and temporarily placed in the "General's Tower" next to the memorial monument to await the funeral. Officials, government dignitaries, diplomatic corps members, and German and foreign journalists arrived by special train one after another. The former Crown Prince also came to participate. A large cross was erected in the center of the memorial monument, and the altar was set up in front of the cross. The coffin was then moved from the tower to the altar, surrounded by officers of the National Defense Army, each holding the flags of the 53 regiments that participated in the Battle of Tannenberg. At exactly eleven o'clock, the crowd was silent and solemn. Hitler, the "Leader and Chancellor," stepped to the front of the mourning altar and paid his respects. Then, the National Defense Army priest prayed and extolled President Hindenburg's loyalty to the country. Hitler then delivered a speech, briefly recounting the President's deeds, saying that the President never sought fame but was committed to promoting the glory of Germany and that there was no difference in peacetime and wartime. After the speech, the military band played patriotic songs, and the troops raised their guns to salute. The coffin was then carried by officers to the door of the "Hindenburg Tower" in the sound of gun salutes. General Mackensen, a former comrade of the President, stood waiting in his light cavalry uniform, his face full of emotion, saluted the coffin, and sent it into the tower. The troops in the field then paraded in formation, and the funeral came to an end. (Havas telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Towering Four Memorial Towers, Tannenberg's Old</h3>
<p>The coffin of President Hindenburg was transported to Tannenberg at dawn today. At that time, the four memorial towers of Tannenberg, which commemorated Hindenburg's great achievements, were illuminated as bright as day. The coffin was carried in a mourning car to the sound of mourning drums, facing the 40-foot-high cross. A viewing platform was built in the field, with seats for the new President Hitler, the late President's son Colonel Hindenburg, cabinet members, members of the diplomatic corps, and members of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Soldiers Participate in the Funeral, Soldiers in the Great War carried the flags of the various regiments that participated in the Battle of Tannenberg. The late President's marshal's baton and medals were placed in front of the coffin.</p>
<p>200,000 People Gathered, People from all over Germany gathered around to watch the ceremony, numbering over 200,000. At the beginning of the ceremony, the band played funeral music, followed by National Defense Army leader Duerrmann reciting the section "Loyalty to the Death," which was said to be in the late President's will.</p>
<p>Loyalty to the Country Until Death, it was said that President Hindenburg did not want to receive any praise or honor at his funeral, but only wanted people to commemorate the soldiers who died in the Great War. The only thing he cared about was the rebirth of Germany, Duerrmann said. After Duerrmann finished speaking, he recited a prayer and sang a hymn, which the surrounding crowd echoed.</p>
<p>Hitler Delivers Eulogy, Hitler then delivered a eulogy, saying that as a result of the Battle of Tannenberg, tens of millions of German people deeply felt the merits of this deceased military man and politician. The bravery and perseverance of the soldiers in the Great War were unmatched by the German soldiers, but they suffered a tragic ending. This was not the fault of General Hindenburg, but the fault of the general politicians. In 1925, the German people elected Hindenburg as President, believing that no one was better than Hindenburg to represent the whole country. This was the last victory of the old army. Hindenburg was not only the protector of the National Socialist Party revolution, but also the protector of national revival. After Hitler finished speaking, the crowd sang "I Have a Comrade" and a military song, and then the coffin was carried to be buried under the Tannenberg Memorial Tower. (Reuters telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Midnight Transfer of the Coffin, Solemn Scene</h3>
<p>(Berlin) When the coffin of the late President Hindenburg was transferred from Neudeck to Tannenberg today, the place where Hindenburg had established his military achievements, to be buried, the scene was extremely solemn. Just after midnight, military drums sounded mournfully, and the coffin was carried out of the Neudeck villa by four officers of the East Prussian Regiment.</p>
<p>Torches Burning Brightly, Troops lined the streets, and a large open square was gathered with two battalions of infantry and one squadron each of artillery and cavalry, all carrying the flags of the regiment, wrapped in black gauze and tilted downwards. At that time, the crowd could only be seen by the raised torches. After the coffin was placed on the mourning car, a brief ceremony was held. The late President's son stood respectfully behind, like a stone statue. Hindenburg's daughter-in-law and two daughters and two sons-in-law were all around the coffin. Several men in silk crowns and evening gowns and women in dark skirts gathered in the village church and sang the song "Power of Love." After the pastor made a short prayer, the coffin was moved to the top of a gun carriage, and a procession began to move forward, with troops slowly following behind. Along the way, soldiers held up torches. When it reached the German Lowlands, the coffin was loaded on a motorcycle hearse, escorted by a squad of military police on motorcycles, and traveled 50 miles, arriving at Tannenberg at four in the morning. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Last night, the funeral of the late President Hindenburg was held in Ostroved, East Prussia, under the dim starlight, winding its way to the Tannenberg cemetery. Two kilometers away from Neudeck, the horses were replaced by cars. The gun carriage carrying Hindenburg's coffin was led by several armored vehicles, followed by motorcycle artillery. Along the route of the procession, Hitler's party troops guarded both sides, stretching endlessly like a human fence, holding torches that emitted a bright light, standing motionless like stone statues.

<h3>Germany Urgently Seeks to Reorganize its Military</h3>
<p>Hitler Does Not Forget His Love for the German-Austrian Merger</p>
<p>The Declaration by the British Acting Prime Minister Has Caused Repercussions</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Chancellor Hitler, in response to various international questions raised by British journalist Brands, made a very clear answer to the declaration made by British Prime Minister Baldwin the other day that Britain's defensive line would henceforth move to the Rhine River. This matter has now attracted the extreme attention of the media here. Hitler said, "If Britain's defensive line must move to the Rhine River, then French politicians may one day go a step further and say that France's defensive line should be set on the banks of the Otter River, and Russia may also rise up and declare that Russia's defensive line should extend to the Danube River. Under such circumstances, the powers do not need to be more jealous of Germany seeking national security within its own borders," etc. Brands then asked Hitler about German-Austrian relations. Hitler said, "Germany does not want to attack Austria, but Germany cannot prevent the Austrians from re-merging with Germany. The separation of these two countries is only a single line apart. Both sides are nations of the same language and race. If a part of Britain is artificially separated, who would want to prevent it from reuniting? However, the merger of Germany and Austria is not an urgent matter today. If Austria can hold a secret vote, I am convinced that everything will be seen clearly. However, Austrian independence is no longer within the scope of any discussion. No one doubts this," etc. (National News telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Various Strange Folk Legends: Eastern Prussia is known for its superstitions. As the late President's coffin passed through the desolate wilderness, under faintly gleaming stars and in absolute silence, a cluster of meteors suddenly flashed across the sky. Local residents regarded this as an extraordinary sign. According to another legend, while believers were praying devoutly in the church in Fresstett today, the statues on the altar suddenly turned by themselves. Some people also claim that as the funeral procession approached, birds and beasts in the nearby forests gathered by the roadside. Upon hearing the sounds of car horns, they all lowered their heads and crouched down as if paying their respects. Moreover, when the funeral procession passed by, the horses all lowered their heads, as if paying homage. Some even claimed to have witnessed a line of deities in the sky following the late President's funeral procession all the way to Tannenberg. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>Commentary from the Paris Times</p>
<h3>A Russo-Japanese War is Inevitable</h3>
<p>But Acknowledged as a Risky Move</p>
<p>(Paris) The Times published an editorial commenting on the relationship between Japan and Soviet Russia, stating roughly: "Some people believe that a war between Japan and Russia is inevitable within a considerable period. However, in our view, this is a risky move. Neither Japan nor Russia is willing to try it lightly. Japan's domestic economic and financial situation is extremely difficult, and Russia, in order to maintain the Soviet system, must also maintain peace. Therefore, both are unfavorable to war. For these reasons, the two countries discuss and negotiate with each other, using extremely subtle conditions for bargaining. They guard against each other in preparation for any eventuality. What is clearly visible is that both sides want to exhaust their diplomatic capabilities to delay the time, and therefore the events that occur in the country accumulate day by day. The Japanese Daily News accuses Soviet Russia of deliberately adopting provocative policies towards Japan and Manchuria. The newspaper also stated that the Tokyo government will be determined to take resolute measures to deal with it, and all current negotiations between the two countries will be shelved. These are the words of Japanese newspapers, but we must wait for a formal statement from the Japanese government before drawing conclusions. It is not prudent to consider the situation serious based on newspaper reports. Newspaper news is not always reliable. It is common for the press to exaggerate before the facts arrive. For example, semi-official newspapers, in order to make the enemy succumb to certain difficult negotiations, exaggerate the facts in advance to intimidate them. This is one. Another is that the government's stance is wavering, and some powerful figures, who benefit from rapid action, create various atmospheres to politically pressure the government to obey their will. This is another. Because of these two, we must carefully listen to the words of Japanese newspapers. In short, the Tokyo government, as of now, has not submitted a negotiation to Moscow according to the intentions stated in the Japanese Daily News, nor has it announced such a negotiation through diplomatic procedures. As far as Japan is concerned, it wants to resolve all issues related to Manchuria, which is very obvious. What Japan is most concerned about is the issue of recognizing Manchuria. However, from various aspects, what can provoke a Russo-Japanese war is neither the Fujian incident in China nor the Manchuria incident. What can promote the rupture between the two countries to the point of no return is the Mongolian issue. The Russians are already the masters of Outer Mongolia, and at present, the power of Japan or its ally Manchuria is gradually extending from Jehol and Chahar to Inner Mongolia. Inner Mongolia has practical benefits for Japan and Manchuria. However, in our view, even if the Mongolian issue occurs, it is not impossible for Japan and Russia to compromise with each other in some way. Only China will suffer. In summary, we should listen to rumors of conflict in the Far East with a calm and reserved attitude, and not believe them lightly. At present, both Japan and Russia are carefully defending themselves, but their self-defense is precisely due to the tortuous and difficult policies they adopt towards each other, which are full of difficulties and surprises, and they cannot maintain their freedom of action with diplomatic rhetoric. What we can say is that neither country has the desire to break the peace and take risks, because war is a dangerous thing. Even if it is fortunately won, the results are unimaginable. Who dares to try it lightly?" (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Attention from the London Times</p>
<h3>Japan's Naval Policy</h3>
<p>Recognizes that it will easily lead to new disputes</p>
<p>(London) The Times, while studying naval issues, has paid attention to Japanese policy. Recently, the newspaper published an article stating, "What the Japanese government is doing will easily lead to new disputes. Prime Minister Okada, on the one hand, declares his opposition to the ratio system, and on the other hand, has not proposed any counter-proposals. It is logically inconsistent to prevent Japan from possessing a navy equal in strength to any other country. However, once the principle of supporting naval power based on the ratio system and signing agreements is recognized, the purpose of the naval conference is only this. The amount of naval armaments of each country should naturally be measured by the defense needs of each country as its normal state. Japan's attitude has not yet been formally notified to various countries. However, it is credible that Japan's proposal may reduce the total tonnage and ship types. In any case, during the preliminary negotiations in London, no agreement was reached by any two countries. Not only was there no clear agreement, but there was also no tacit understanding. This can be said with certainty. Although Japan and Italy have not formally participated in the naval negotiations, when the negotiations reopen in the future, the naval experts of these two countries will be in the same position as those of other countries who have expressed their opinions, without any difference. The benefits of signing agreements to limit armaments are already obvious in practice. What is puzzling is why those who have already enjoyed the benefits of disarmament now want to go the same way of competing in shipbuilding?" (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>U.S. Army Department Testing</p>
<h3>Stratospheric Anti-Aircraft Gun</h3>
<p>Can shoot straight up to ten miles away</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States Army Department is currently testing a "stratospheric anti-aircraft gun" for air defense. It is claimed that this anti-aircraft gun is the latest invention in air defense weaponry, and military experts believe that it can solve the United States' land air defense problems. The Associated Press learned today that the Army Department's ballistics experts hope that the anti-aircraft gun can shoot straight up to ten miles away. The gun is equipped with a special electrical machine that can accurately determine the altitude, speed, and direction of aircraft in the air. It is very accurate and can be described as hitting the target every time. This new weapon is part of the Army Department's air defense plan. Currently, due to lack of funding, it has not been actively implemented. It is said that today Secretary of the Army Dern hopes to allocate US$33 million from the Public Works Administration to start work first. It is reported that the Public Works Administration has expressed great sympathy for the Army Department's proposal. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Army Department is now preparing to begin an expansion of the standing army. Enlisted personnel will increase from 118,000 to 165,000, and officers will increase from 12,000 to 14,000. The department will also request an additional US$35 million in army funding from Congress. According to powerful officials, the General Staff had previously expressed the opinion that the U.S. Army was insufficient to protect the safety of the country and overseas territories. After Secretary of the Army Dern personally visited the Panama Canal Zone and the western regions for on-site inspections, he confirmed that the General Staff's words were correct. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3>Australia Rejects Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Implementation of New Tariff Restrictions on Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Stop Buying Australian Wool in Retaliation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Australian government has imposed a prohibitive tariff on Japanese cotton cloth from August 2, implementing a rejection of Japanese goods. As a result, Japanese textile and cotton cloth exporters will suffer a great blow. Some advocate that, like the implementation of not buying Indian cotton, they should resolutely stop buying Australian wool to urge the Australian government to reflect. However, according to the opinions of wool industrialists, stopping buying Australian wool cannot be implemented and can only be reduced by 30 to 40 percent. The reduced amount can be supplemented by South American wool. The Textile Federation and exporters have already discussed this, and if shipping companies intend to reduce freight rates, there is no objection to implementing a reduction in the amount of wool imported. Therefore, the retaliatory import restrictions have the possibility of being realized. (Den-tsu, 7th)</p>

<h3>Ambassador to Paraguay</h3>
<p>Setback for the Gran Chaco Peace Movement</p>
<p>Washington Deeply Concerned</p>
<p>(Washington) Chile is preparing to recall its ambassador to Paraguay, so the situation in South America is becoming increasingly dangerous today. According to the Associated Press, from the most reliable diplomatic sources here, Chile, due to news reports in the Paraguayan capital Asunción claiming that Chile had failed to maintain neutrality in the Gran Chaco War, requested an explanation from the Paraguayan Foreign Ministry but did not receive a satisfactory response, so it will order its ambassador to return home. After receiving this news, there is great unease here, because although Chile may not join the Gran Chaco War, recalling its ambassador will strengthen Paraguay's fighting spirit and make the peace movement more difficult to carry out.

<p>Romania</p>
<h3>Internal and External Troubles Abound</h3>
<p>National Thought Leaning to the Right</p>
<p>Bucharest The difficulties of Romania's diplomacy, domestic politics, and economy are gradually becoming serious and can lead to incidents at any time. On the international front, Romania's relationship with Soviet Russia is gradually easing, so there is no need to worry about the north. This is the only optimistic point. However, the long-standing Bessarabia issue has not been resolved. However, the two countries are about to restore diplomatic relations, which may promote a peaceful resolution of this matter. In addition, the Balkan Pact has completely failed and has not achieved the expected results. Greece, one of the signatory countries, now has many complaints and restricts the invocation of the pact, so the value of the pact is little. Romania's relationship with Bulgaria is not bad, but it is inevitably lukewarm. Bulgaria still refuses to participate in the pact. The illusion of cooperation between the two countries that emerged after King Boris of Bulgaria's visit to Bucharest no longer exists. Regarding Hungary in the West, the two countries are fiercely competing and have no hope of reconciliation. Judging from the Rome Agreement established by Mussolini, Dollfuss, and Gömbös, the Little Entente's imposition of economic pressure on Hungary must be considered a failure. Romania believes that it is useless to negotiate with Hungary, but it is noteworthy that the talk of preventing war against Hungary is now spreading again. In terms of domestic politics, Romania is hovering between the current democratic system and constitutional reform. Constitutional reform will sacrifice the parliament and expand the power of the government. Although King Carol has not participated in political disputes, he believes that breaking away from the current political system may benefit the country. After the hope of reforming the country from the parliament failed to materialize, the people turned to the right wing, especially the youth. The disputes between the two major parties in the parliament have adequately promoted the rightward leaning of national thought, but similar incidents may not be able to happen in the near future.

<h3>Haiti Restores Freedom</h3>
<p>U.S. Troops Begin Withdrawal Next Week</p>

<p>The northern coast of the Haitian capital has been stationed by the U.S. Marines and flying the U.S. flag for 19 years. Today, the Haitian flag has been changed to fly. This is proof that the U.S. military has begun to withdraw. The U.S. Marines have been stationed in Haiti from 1915 to August 7, 1933. An agreement was signed between the two governments stipulating that the U.S. military should withdraw completely by November 30 of this year. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3>A Scene of Arid Drought</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt Heartbroken by What He Saw</p>
<p>Decides to Implement Both Drought Prevention and Relief</p>
<p>Havre, USA President Roosevelt, while passing through the arid and sparsely populated state of Montana in his car today, stopped briefly and delivered a prepared speech. Havre, known as the coldest place in the United States, today had crowds gathered at the station to see the president, all with bare chests and rolled up sleeves. Seeing this arid scene, the president, reflecting on his relief plan, sadly said, "From now on, drought prevention should go hand in hand with building reservoirs and providing relief. This kind of work requires ample time, but I know that you will help me succeed." The president looked around along the way today, all he saw was a barren landscape, with livestock starving and dying of thirst. Most of the rivers, large and small, under the railway bridges were completely dry. In the car, the president listened quietly to the report of government disaster relief commissioner Wesbrook. Mr. Wesbrook said that the government has spent US$500 million, and the disaster area has increased by 30% since Congress adjourned. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>Stamp Tax Revenue</p>
<h3>Regulations for Offsetting the Finances of Cities and Counties</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) To abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, the stamp tax revenue will be allocated to various provinces, cities, and counties as compensation. The regulations stipulate that provinces and counties receive 40%, and cities receive 10%. The city authorities believe that this method is unfair, and the city's finances have huge expenses. The number of 10% is not enough to make up for the shortfall. They advocate that it should be evenly distributed with the provinces and counties. The Beiping Municipal Finance Bureau has sent a letter to the city's finance bureau requesting that they jointly strive for an increase in the amount of finances to the Ministry of Finance and also send a circular to the finance bureaus of various cities to jointly hold onto an increase in the number of finances to avoid disputes.

<h3>The American Economic Crisis American Correspondence</h3>
<p>The New Deal's Effects are Minimal</p>
<p>Labor-Management Disputes Erupt Everywhere</p>
<p>When President Roosevelt came to power, he was faced with the outbreak of a financial panic, and the nation was in turmoil. Fortunately, he used his well-trained skills to quell the turmoil. However, society in general remained uneasy, and unemployed workers still had no jobs or food. That's when the National Industrial Recovery Act (NRA) was used to relieve the current panic and find jobs for the unemployed. When the Act was implemented, a declaration was made, "I am determined not to let a single person starve to death in our country." In the same declaration, he also stated, "This winter, the industrial sector will undoubtedly emerge from the darkness." Is this really the case? We only need to quote the "Nation" magazine for criticism. It said, "The Recovery Administration is all lies, and the group contracts stipulated by the NRA are nothing but a scrap of paper"... The strike disputes that occurred from June to October last year were truly countless. 75,000 people participated in the strike movement of raw silk factories in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. There were 2,000 coal miners on strike in Indiana. Four textile workers were killed in California. 2,000 people at the Weirton Steel plant went on strike, and police fired tear gas, sacrificing several people. Two hundred representatives of spinning mills ran to Washington to petition General Johnson. Strikes broke out in other industrial sectors as well. At the end of last year, a total of 787,000 people participated in strikes. Since the beginning of this year, there has been no end in sight. As of March, the cumulative number of strikers was more than 187,500. As for the steel and auto industries, which the entire United States is focused on, the strike movement was barely settled. However, the dispute between transportation workers centered in San Francisco is brewing a very serious movement.</p>
<p>According to a report by William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, at the beginning of June this year, there were 10,267,000 unemployed people, a decrease of 3,400,000 from the time when unemployment was highest in March last year, and an increase of 160,000 from the time when unemployment was lowest in September last year. Since the beginning of this year, 11,688,000 people in January have now found new jobs for 1,421,000 people, which is a slight improvement. Although the employment situation has improved slightly, wages have not increased. According to a survey by the Federal Reserve Board (using the average from 1923 to 1925 as the benchmark), the wage index in May this year was 67.1, compared to 42.7 in May last year and 52.9 in January this year. From these figures, it is clear that there has been a significant improvement, but it has decreased by 0.1 compared to April this year. According to Green, 4,475,000 families received unemployment relief in April last year. A year later, there are still 3,850,000 families, and when added to the emergency unemployment relief, there are still more than 4,600,000 people. This situation is not only not showing signs of improvement, but is actually deteriorating. According to a report by the National Industrial Research Association, the average weekly working hours for male workers in May this year was 36.1 hours, a decrease of 1.9% from April. The wages earned in May were $20.81, while the wages in April were $21, a decrease of 0.9%. However, during this period, the cost of living for workers increased by 0.3%. As a result, workers' lives are even more insecure, and there are more and more disputes. The division between labor and management is becoming more and more obvious. Therefore, the membership of the American Federation of Labor has increased from about 2 million last year to more than 4 million this year.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the New York Times (assuming normal conditions are 100), the comprehensive index of general industrial activity was 88.7 at the end of April this year, 84.9 at the end of May, and 84.8 at the end of June. The amount of steel mills, power plants, automobile factories, timber production, cotton trading, etc., except for electricity and automobiles, are all declining. No wonder labor is complaining, and the economic panic has not yet passed.</p>
<p>Recently, the prices of agricultural products, cotton and wheat, have risen, but this is the result of artificial reduction in production and natural reduced harvests. The real income of farmers has not increased. The shift in farmers' purchasing power (based on the five-year average from 1924 to 1929) fell from 101.3 in June last year to 61.0 in December and 73.0 in May this year, which is lower than in May last year but 12 points higher than at the end of last year. From this, it can be seen that it is not easy to increase farmers' purchasing power, and its impact on the entire economy is also very large. After one year of implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act, the result is only this. The prospect of restoring prosperity is still very distant. (July 5th, New York)</p>
<p>Yin Tong</p>
<h3>Leaving Mogan Mountain for Beijing</h3>
<p>Li Zeyi's Trip to Japan Had No Mission</p>
<p>Huang Fu Going to Lushan to Await Telegram Before Proceeding</p>
<p>Saying of Holding Meetings Between China and Japan is Incorrect</p>
<p>Yin Will First Visit Tie and Gu After Returning to Beijing</p>
<p>Mogan Mountain Correspondence: Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, returned from the Dalian meeting and arrived at Mogan Mountain on July 28th to visit Huang Fu, Chairman of the Pingzheng Reorganization Committee, to report on the proceedings. He stayed at Room No. 1 of the Caigengxiang Hotel. Yin spent consecutive days in Huang's residence, discussing in detail with Huang the reorganization of the war zone and the various resolved but yet-to-be-received issues. They had a comprehensive plan. Yin also stayed on the mountain for a short period due to a foot ailment, which has lasted for a week. Now, Huang Fu, due to urging from various parties and the gradual resolution of difficulties in the war zone, will have to travel to Lushan within a few days to discuss the overall plan for North China with Chairman Jiang and President Wang. Yin, considering his mission completed, went down the mountain at 6:00 AM yesterday (the 6th) and took a car along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway to Beijing. Only his adjutant, Liu Guozhang, and two or three pieces of light luggage accompanied him. The reporter received news in advance and made a special visit to Ban's house this morning. Yin was ordering his servants to organize his luggage, wearing a white summer cloth shirt and trousers, a straw hat, white socks and black shoes, and holding a cane, his attitude was calm. According to Yin's statement to the reporter, the rumor that Li Zeyi, a member of the Pingzheng Reorganization Committee, went to Japan to seek to break the Sino-Japanese deadlock, Li's trip was actually because his eldest son, Gongshang, has been receiving treatment in Tokyo, Japan for three years. Recently, his illness has worsened. After receiving a telegram in Shanghai, Li went to see his condition. The news of a mission is incorrect. Chairman Huang (Fu)'s date of going north is imminent. The trip to Lushan must await telegrams from Wang and Jiang before it can be made. Huang's trip to Lushan to discuss the overall situation in North China. The plane or train route has not been determined. The establishment of checkpoints on the Great Wall is progressing smoothly. Several locations have already been established. The Gubeikou will be realized within a short period of time. The saying that there is no result is a misunderstanding. The steps to reorganize the war zone include receiving Malanyu Donglu, newly compiled security team of ninety men open into the war zone for troop replacement, crackdown on illegal Japanese and Korean vagrants and the Great East Company, etc., are all in orderly progress. The flood in Malanyu has receded. Since Yin Rugeng is still ill, he will begin to receive the area when he recovers. The puppet army will also withdraw at that time. As for implementing proper strategies for resolving various issues, he will discuss and implement them after his return to Beijing. There is no date for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from various passes of the Great Wall. After forcing peace, negotiations will continue. The saying that a formal meeting between China and Japan will be held when Huang Fu goes north is also unreliable. He is going to Beijing this time to wait for a visit from Minister Gu. Gu will return south in a day or two, and then discuss the affairs of the Beining Railway Bureau. He will return to Ping after completing the matter within a week. Whether he will go to Lushan depends on the situation. If necessary, he may make a trip. He said there was nothing much to say about the long talks with Chairman Huang these days. In short, the trend of the entire North China situation has turned towards a bright road. Recently, the Sino-Japanese situation has indeed been gradually developing and is gradually improving. He also said that Liu Shisun's saying that he came to Mogan to visit Huang is incorrect. Liu has not yet arrived at the mountain and could not visit Huang. At this point, Yin boarded a sedan chair and went down the mountain, and at 7:40, he took the chartered Zhejiang No. 1161 small chartered car directly to Nanjing.</p>
<p>According to Ge Jingen, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government who was staying at Mogan Mountain, Huang's private residence at No. 509 has recently had many guests. He will be able to make the trip to Lushan and return north within a few days. The exact date must be determined by receiving telegrams from President Wang and Chairman Jiang. (6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Arbitrary Levies in Rehe</h3>
<p>丨Exorbitant Taxes, People Can't Bear Life丨</p>
<p>According to people from Rehe, the Japanese have recently forced the collection of various taxes in Rehe, one after another. Under their tyranny, the people of the Northeast dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Recently, they have labeled new items and forced the collection of so-called aviation donations, as well as donations for people, cattle, horses, chickens, dogs, etc. Each chicken is donated two cents per month, and each dog is donated three cents per month. The item must also include the dog owner's name and a wooden photo license. Each head of cattle and horse is donated eight cents per month, and each person pays an annual donation of four yuan and six cents. Planting opium and collecting opium paste are all purchased by the puppet officials and are not allowed to be sold privately. The Doron Cavalry has been completely converted into infantry, and the horses have been ordered to be sold and are not allowed to be raised privately.</p>
<h3>Remnants of Bandits in Minjiang Retreat</h3>
<p>No Trace of Bandits on Both Banks Above Baisha</p>
<p>The Remnant Bandits Below Yanping Will Be Eliminated Soon</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: More than 6,000 remnants of Red bandits in northern Fujian, led by Luo Binghui, broke through from Mingxi and Qingliu in mid-July, and fled into Shaxian and Yong'an, eventually fleeing into Youxi and Datian. They gathered local bandits along the way, looting grain. Their whereabouts were extremely elusive. On August 1, they suddenly broke out along the Minjiang River, with bandits found in the area of the Minqingkou Zhanghu Slope in Gutian Minqing. They intercepted and robbed ships along the river, attempting to seize rice and salt to fill their grain, causing the waterway traffic between the provincial capital and northern Fujian to be cut off. Wang Jinxiu, the Minjiang Garrison Commander, telegraphed the provincial government to report and immediately dispatched two regiments of security troops to block them with all their might. From 3:00 PM on the 1st to 4:00 AM on the 2nd, the war was extremely fierce in the riverside areas of Minqingkou, Youxikou, Zhanghu Slope, Sandukou, Shuikou, Huangtian, Gukou, and Wankou. Fortunately, the National Army fought bravely and held the defensive line extremely firmly, so the bandits could not succeed. The provincial authorities sent reinforcements and also had the air force bomb. The bandit crowd along the Minjiang River above Shuikou and Baisha (60 li from Fuzhou) were overwhelmed after being attacked by land and air forces, and retreated above Shuikou on the evening of the 2nd. From the morning of the 3rd, there were no traces of bandits on both banks of the river above Baisha. The situation in the front gradually eased. At present, a line has been formed from Hongshan, the west gate of Fuzhou, along the river to Shuikou, and the defense is extremely strong. Chiang Ting-wen, the commander of the eastern route, also flew to the province from Zhang on the afternoon of the 3rd to command everything. The remnant bandits who are now gathered above Shuikou and below Yanping along the Minjiang River have been ordered by Wei Lihuang on the 4th to be encircled and suppressed by Liu Heding and Lu Xingbang's two divisions, starting from Yanping and Youxi. They can be pacified within a few days. (4th)</p>
<h3>Decline of Various Industries in Java</h3>
<p>The Impact is Greater in East Java</p>
<p>Small Industries Are Still Considered Developed</p>
<p>Batavia Special Correspondence: Among the Dutch colonies in the East Indies, the richest island is Java. Although Java is not very large, because its land is fertile and its products are abundant, it occupies an important position in the world market. In the past, during its heyday, Java's total exports ranked fourth in the world's export value. The magnitude of its productivity can be known. However, since the recession invaded Nanyang, the world market has shrunk, and Java's native products have nowhere to be sold, and they all feel surplus, resulting in a very serious blow.</p>
<p>The largest and most famous industry in Java, and the one known to the world, is none other than the sugar industry. Since the world's sugar production has been in surplus, Java's sugar industry has long been in decline. Great sugar factories have closed down one after another, sugarcane fields have become barren, and the number of unemployed workers is countless. Other industries have also been greatly affected. The recent industrial situation in East Java is briefly described below. ▲ Sugar Industry The sugar industry in East Java has not improved at present. Many sugarcane fields are barren, especially in the southern part of Malang. However, there is one exception that is worth our attention, that is, the sugar factories in the area south of Jianyi are doing well. There are even plans to expand the sugarcane fields in the Lilyfen region. The sugar produced in Jianyi is a different kind of sugar, commonly known as "cube sugar," which is coarser than the granulated sugar produced elsewhere. This kind of sugar is quite popular in East Java, and it is also sold abroad. Its manufacturing method is simple, without the need to add other raw materials, so the cost is very low and the price is very cheap. The sugar factories in the Jianyi area mainly produce this kind of sugar.</p>
<p>Cigarettes The most important industry in East Java, in addition to the sugar industry, is the cigarette industry. In the interior, such as Mulidda, Torongagong, Jianyi, as well as Lilyfen, Reban, and Yanwang, there are many small cigarette factories. Most of the products are second-class goods. Due to the impact of the recession, the sales of high-quality cigarettes produced by large factories are sluggish, so this kind of small industry is thriving.</p>
<p>Tiles The tile industry in East Java was also very famous, but at present, because real estate prices have fallen and there are not many people building houses, the industry is feeling very tired. The number of products produced in the area around the Mulanddas River has been reduced by half, and the price has also fallen by 20%. More than half of the factories have been shut down.</p>
<p>Leather Manufacturing The leather manufacturing industry has also declined significantly. The Jinshi leather factories have all restricted their production. Of the seven factories that used to exist, only two remain. The leather factories run by overseas Chinese in the Surabaya area have also been working only half-time because their products are not selling well. The same is true in Bangkalan. However, although the market is so bad, the number of small factories set up by the natives has increased instead.</p>
<p>Matches The match factories in East Java cannot stand due to the dumping of foreign matches. Most of them have stopped operating, and their products have been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Iron Factories The situation in iron factories has also declined, especially in Surabaya. Many factories have stopped operating.</p>
<p>Sarongs Sarongs are the skirts worn by native Nanyang people, printed with patterns, so they are also called flower skirts. Whether men or women, the natives like to wear them. The number of flower skirts produced in Java was very large, but recently, due to the poor market situation, the natives have no money to buy them, so they have declined significantly. However, since the Dutch East Indies implemented the import restriction law for cotton textiles, the weaving industry in East Java has shown signs of recovery.</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between Wang and You in Guizhou Province</h3>
<p>Meeting in Guanling to Discuss Bandit Suppression and Post-War Plans</p>
<p>Fellow Provincials in Guangdong Province Telegraph Countermeasures for Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The dispute between You Guocai and Wang Jialie in Guizhou Province has recently been mediated by representatives from various southwestern provinces. You has agreed to cooperate with Wang. They held a meeting in Guanling on the 25th of last month (July) to clarify previous misunderstandings and discuss future cooperation methods, which resulted in a satisfactory outcome. Wang and You jointly telegraphed the southwestern authorities to report the meeting's progress. The original telegram stated: "The situation in Guizhou has been turbulent for two years, all due to the inadequate performance of duties by Jialie and Guocai. We deeply appreciate the earnest efforts of the representatives in mediating and encouraging us. We feel deeply guilty and immensely grateful. We are determined to unite and live up to expectations. Recently, He bandits have been causing trouble on the Guizhou border. Jialie and others have a responsibility to defend the area and must work together with utmost sincerity to quickly quell the banditry, respectfully protect our homeland, and loyally serve the Party and the nation, thereby atoning for our past failings. Jialie and Guocai met in Guanling County on July 25th to discuss bandit suppression plans and post-war arrangements for Guizhou, and we have reached complete agreement. We will implement these plans gradually starting today. Jialie will return to the province on the 27th, and Guocai will also rush to Guiyang within ten days after completing local affairs to serve together. We hope for continued guidance so that we can follow a clear path and avoid missteps. We pray for your favorable consideration. Respectfully submitted, Wang Jialie, Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government and Commander of the 25th Army; and You Guocai, Member of the Guizhou Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression for the entire province, bowing and imprinted from Guanling." Fellow Guizhou natives in Guangdong believe that since Wang and You are cooperating, their future efforts to suppress bandits are what the people of Guizhou hope for. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to the Guiyang Bandit Suppression Support Association in the name of the Guizhou natives in Guangdong, offering ten strategies for bandit suppression. The main points are as follows: (1) Find ways to relieve refugees in bandit areas to prevent the poor from blindly following the bandits and taking risks. (2) Prevent counter-revolutionary propaganda by bandits, strictly implement the Baojia system, and enforce collective responsibility. (3) Pay attention to the discipline of bandit suppression troops and local corrupt officials to avoid forcing people to become bandits. (4) Organize militia to take responsibility for guarding, scouting, and suppressing bandits. (5) Prevent the deterioration of communist bandits to avoid affecting customs. (6) Implement a blockade policy, prohibiting the import of oil, salt, gunpowder, electrical materials, and food into bandit areas. (7) Deploy defensive works. (8) Build fortresses to defend against bandits. (9) In recovered bandit areas, organize the people, educate and reform them, and avoid excessive killing to leave room for bandits to turn over a new leaf. (10) Expand propaganda on the crimes of the communist bandits, and raise donations to comfort the soldiers at the front. (August 2nd)</p>
<h3>Summary of the New Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Agreement</h3>
<p>The New Agreement is Valid for Five Years</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The negotiations for the revision of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway agreement concluded at the end of last month. The representatives of the Ministry of Railways, Zhang Wei and Mo Jiefu, returned north on the 2nd of this month to report to the Ministry of Railways and brought back the draft agreement for approval by the Executive Yuan. It is expected that the new agreement will be implemented by both China and Britain around October 1st. The Guangdong representatives, Li Jigen, Hu Dongchao, and Hu Jixian, have also returned to Guangdong from Hong Kong. Mr. Hu reported the progress of the draft agreement signing to the provincial government. The following is a summary of the content of the new agreement: (1) Profit Sharing: Previously, China accounted for 65% and Britain accounted for 35%. It is now changed to China accounting for 72% and Britain accounting for 28%. (2) Supply of Vehicles: Previously, China supplied four vehicles and Britain supplied one vehicle. Now, the distribution of vehicle supply will be based on the amount of profit share. (3) Previously, if either party did not have enough vehicles for dispatch, it could rent vehicles from the other party, paying rent and a penalty. The penalty amount was more than double the transportation fee. Now, the penalty clause will be abolished. (4) Previously, if an accident occurred that caused the train to stop, the party where the accident occurred would be responsible. This clause has been abolished and replaced with a clause stating that if an accident occurs that causes the train to stop, neither party shall be liable for compensation. (5) If a bridge on either side of the railway is damaged, causing an accident, the party responsible for the bridge will be liable for the losses. (6) When Chen Jiongming was in power in Guangdong, military disturbances in the East River area caused the railway to stop for several months. At that time, the British side demanded compensation of more than one million yuan according to the previous agreement. This negotiation canceled the British side's claim. (7) The draft agreement will be officially signed by both governments and will be implemented from October 1st, with a validity period of five years. (8) This negotiation did not involve matters such as joint transportation with other railways. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in Shou County, Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Shou County Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer, the weather in this county has been extremely hot. The indoor thermometer has risen to 108 degrees, and no rain has fallen. The seedlings have all withered. Currently, the fields are cracked several inches deep, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. The disaster is described as follows: (1) Rice is the main agricultural product of this county. There were severe droughts in the past two years (1932 and 1933), and the ditches had no water storage. This year, it only rained when plowing, so most of the early rice could not be transplanted this year. Those in lower-lying areas who were fortunate enough to transplant seedlings were scorched by the heat. The most severe situation is that farmers in this county, based on the preciousness of rainwater in recent years, prepared late rice and drought-resistant rice to prevent unexpected events. However, this year there is no rainwater at all. Not only can they not transplant, but even the late-season drought-resistant rice has withered, resulting in a tragic disaster. (2) The autumn grain crop in this county, sorghum, is relatively drought-resistant and matures earlier. It is an important food supplement for farmers between the summer and autumn seasons, and its stalks are the only fuel in this county. Therefore, sorghum is planted in every village. However, the extreme heat this summer occurred entirely before the start of the hot season, just when the sorghum was heading. The scorching heat lasted for two months, causing it to wither completely. Sorghum planted in low-lying fields had kernels as fine as mustard seeds, making it difficult to feed the people. (3) Since there was no water to transplant rice before the hot season, among the later-season crops, there were still soybeans and mung beans. Soybeans were planted earlier, and mung beans were planted slightly later. Now, after planting, the seedlings that had sprouted were all subjected to the scorching sun and were eaten by insects. Those that had not sprouted were scorched in the soil and could not grow again. Even if it rains heavily later, it will be too late. There will be no grain to plant in the fields, and the disaster is extremely severe. (4) This county is located on the south bank of the Huai River, with higher terrain in the southeast and lower terrain in the northwest. The tributaries of the Huai River, such as the Fei and Pai Rivers, mostly flow northwest into the Huai River. The crops along the river are slightly more lush than in ordinary fields, but there are not many of them. Unexpectedly, the water from the Yingzhou River flowed backward and flooded the fields, so even this small amount of grain is difficult to save. This is the most unusual aspect of the disaster. In summary, the severity of the disaster in this county can be seen. Currently, various public legal entities and gentry have held a joint meeting to plead for relief and have submitted requests for disaster relief to the National Government, the Provincial Government, and the Special Commissioner.

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Commends Xu Zi</h3>
<p>丨The Portrait is Preserved by the New Life Movement Association丨</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Xu Gao Shi Provincial Ancestral Hall Post-Disaster Maintenance Association believes that the virtuous Gao Shi Xu Zi has left a legacy of lofty character and integrity for thousands of years. At a time when the New Life Movement is being vigorously promoted, emphasizing propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, a photograph of Xu Zi's portrait was specially taken and presented to Chairman Chiang to honor the virtuous scholar. Chairman Chiang believes that the life and deeds of Gao Shi Xu are truly worthy of respect. In addition to entrusting Gao Shi's portrait to the New Life Movement Association for safekeeping as a memorial, he also replied to the Xu Gao Shi Provincial Ancestral Hall Post-Disaster Maintenance Association in the name of the President of the New Life Movement Association. The following is a record: (1) Letter to Chiang: "Respectfully submitted to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, our ancestor Zi is recorded in history as being respectful, frugal, righteous, and yielding. His residence served his virtue. His son, Ji Deng, earnestly practiced filial piety and brotherly love. At the end of the Han Dynasty, bandits and thieves roamed wildly, but they mutually agreed not to offend his neighborhood. It is not difficult to imagine his ability to reverse the declining customs and quell the banditry. At a time when the New Life Movement is being vigorously promoted, emphasizing propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, we specially re-photographed the portrait of our ancestor Zi to assist the New Life Movement. We dare not avoid disrespect, and we respectfully enclose a photograph of our ancestor. We humbly ask for your approval and wish you peace." (2) Chiang's Reply: "In reply, I received a portrait of the virtuous scholar Xu Zi. After reading it, I deeply admire him. It has now been safely stored in this association as a memorial. This is my reply." (August 5th)</p>
<h3>Drug Traffickers from Songjiang Escorted to Town for Interrogation</h3>
<p>The three drug traffickers arrested by the Public Security Bureau at the Xindongmen on Qiche Road, Kong Jihuang; the drug trafficker Wang Xinfa, found at the Xie Sheng Inn; and the morphine trafficker Song Ahe, escorted from Xin Zhuang, along with the seized evidence, were sent to the County Government. After the County Government sent personnel to interrogate them, it was determined that according to the regulations prohibiting drug trafficking, they should be sent to the Garrison Command for investigation. Therefore, Political Police Chief Dong Futang and others were ordered to escort the three drug traffickers, Kong Jihuang and others, to the Zhenjiang Garrison Command for interrogation at 5:00 PM on the 7th.</p>
<h3>Resignation of the Accountant of the Public Property Office</h3>
<p>Lu Longxiang was previously appointed by the County Government as the director of the County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office to take over. According to regulations, Shen Fuyun, Wang Zhewu, Li Jianong, Liu Jihai, and Li Yangxian were selected and appointed as accountants. Recently, after receiving an order from the Finance Department issuing the revised regulations for the management organization of various counties in Jiangsu Province, the county was classified as a Class B county because its revenue exceeded 30,000 yuan. The accountants suddenly jointly resigned to the County Government. It is reported that the County Government decided to retain them.</p>
<h3>Resignation of the Chief of the Taicang Public Security Bureau and Police Inspectors</h3>
<p>Ma Jiayong, a police inspector at the Second Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau in this county, was reported for sheltering and accepting bribes in several opium cases. County Magistrate Wang personally investigated and confirmed the facts. After the incident, Police Inspector Ma Jiayong, fearing punishment, abandoned his post and fled. He has not yet been apprehended. The police inspectors from the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sub-Bureaus suddenly resigned to the County Public Security Bureau. Gan Zhuo, the Chief of the County Public Security Bureau, also telegraphed the Provincial Department and the County Government to resign. Because the incident was bizarre, the people of the entire county are deeply suspicious.</p>
<h3>Suzhou County Government Proceeds to Borrow Large Sums of Money</h3>
<p>The Suzhou County Water and Land Police Expenses, Prisoner Food Expenses, Education Expenses, etc., are in arrears of more than 100,000 yuan and urgently need to be paid. However, the county treasury is empty and there is no way to raise funds. County Magistrate Wu went to the provincial government the day before yesterday to request instructions and returned to Suzhou yesterday. It is said that he has obtained the permission of the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments to borrow more than 100,000 yuan by using land tax as collateral from the banking, money lending, and land industries. A meeting will be convened immediately. However, these three industries believe that there are difficulties with this matter, so it is feared that it will be difficult to fully achieve the goal.</p>
<h3>Reaction to the Separate Payment of Security Deposits for Electricity in Wuxi</h3>
<p>After the County Government of this county was ordered to reorganize the county's Security Corps and Police Team into a Security Team, there are now five companies and five independent detachments, with a total of 884 officers and soldiers. The general headquarters is located in the County Government, specializing in security matters. Last month, Bai Zhujun, a supervisor from the Jiangsu Provincial Security Office of the Wuxi District Security Team, came to Wuxi. He set up a supervisor's office in the Yang Ou Gong Ancestral Hall in Huishan, organized a squad leader training class, and trained officers and soldiers of the security teams of eight counties in the Wuxi District. The supervisor's office has now moved to Changshu to work the day before yesterday. It is also learned that in order to actively unify the training of security teams, the Military Affairs Committee of the Nanchang Headquarters will reorganize the security teams of various counties in ten provinces, including Jiangsu, into security general brigades or security brigades, directly commanded by the Provincial Security Office and subordinate to the Military Affairs Committee. The order has been issued by the Nanchang Headquarters, and the reorganization must be completed within one and a half months of receiving the document. Counties with more than six security companies can be reorganized into security general brigades. Those with less than six security companies will be reorganized into security brigades. Those with only one company will be reorganized into companies directly under the Provincial Security Office.</p>
<h3>Sports Meet in Changshu Causes Trouble, Two People Wounded</h3>
<p>Sports meets are prevalent in various places this summer, and it is even more so here. In July, there were more than a dozen events. On the 6th of this month, the sports meet at the Nan Zhuang General Temple outside the South Gate was even more grand than before. The event usually has attendants such as those carrying dragon heads and beating gongs and drums, which are usually performed by beggars who can charge fees. Unexpectedly, the temple sports meet had the Jinluo Society perform this task. Therefore, the beggars held a grudge and gathered to discuss ways to retaliate. After the event that afternoon, the beggar leader Zhu Er led a group of beggars, secretly carrying weapons, and ambushed at the key road of Sizhangwan. When the procession passed by, Zhu jumped out of the crowd first, holding a kitchen knife, and stopped the gong players and started hacking indiscriminately. Unexpectedly, the people he attacked were from the Biluo Society, not the Jinluo Society. As a result, Qiang Bingrong of the Biluo Society had the back of his head and Chen Guisheng had his ear cut off. The scene was immediately thrown into chaos, and the injured fell to the ground, unconscious. The police then sent the injured to the hospital, and the murderer Zhu Er was arrested and sent to the bureau. The rest escaped.</p>
<h3>Tax Police in Haimen Murdered</h3>
<p>A tax police platoon is stationed in Haifu Town in the Sixth District. The day before yesterday (the 4th) at night, four police officers were sent out on patrol to prevent smuggling of private salt. When the police returned to the team one after another at dawn, it was discovered that Jie Bingrong was missing. The police were immediately ordered to search in all directions. Soon, Jie's body was found floating on the water in the North River in the town. His hands were tied behind his back with rope, and his rifle was left in the reeds by the river. It was clear that he had been murdered. The team reported to the County Government yesterday (the 5th) and requested them to send personnel to investigate and arrest the murderer.</p>
<h3>Police Chief from Nantong Lost Official Documents While Escorting Prisoner</h3>
<p>The Nantong District Security Command sent Zheng, a police inspector from the Nantong Public Security Bureau, and Police Chief Wang Shu to escort drug offender Ma Dazhuang to the Zhenjiang Garrison Command. On the way, they lost the official documents and evidence. Zheng and Wang returned quickly. After being interrogated by the command, they were shackled and imprisoned.</p>

<h3>German Consul-General in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday Held a Memorial Service for the Late President</p>
<p>More Than 700 Chinese and Foreign Guests Attended</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Personally Went to Offer Condolences</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after the death of former German President Paul von Hindenburg on the 2nd of this month, the world mourned. The German Consulate-General in Shanghai and the German community in Shanghai specially held a memorial service at the German Church at the corner of Avenue Haig and Great West Road at 6:00 PM yesterday. It is estimated that about 700 Chinese and foreign people attended, and Mayor Wu Tiecheng also went to offer condolences in person. The atmosphere was extremely solemn. The German Consulate-General and German shops in Shanghai all flew flags at half-mast to express their grief. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Scene Arrangement</p>
<p>The memorial service was held on the lawn in front of the church. The German government flag was hung in the middle of the church door, with the German national flag and party flags of various countries and parties hung beside it. A false spiritual seat was set up in front, covered with a cross flag, and the front was filled with wreaths presented by various circles. The Municipal Government, the Ministry of Transportation, Tongji University, and the Tongji University Alumni Association all presented wreaths. Twenty-one National Socialist Party members and ten female party members stood on both sides of the spirit, holding party flags and dressed in military uniform. In front of them were the guests' seats, the news reporter seats on the left, and the mourning music team seats on the right. The arrangement was simple and solemn. Detectives were densely deployed in front of the church gate, and the security was tight.</p>
<p>Condolence Visitors</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, starting from 5:30, the traffic on Avenue Haig and Great West Road was heavy, and the road was almost blocked. A total of about 700 people attended the memorial service, mostly German residents. The Chinese attendees included Mayor and Songhu Garrison Commander Wu Tiecheng, Secretary Tang Shixuan, Director of the Municipal Security Office Yang Hu, Secretary Wang Zhiren, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Wen Hongen, Section Chief Li Mu, Section Chief Zhao Tiezhang of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Mengling, Representative of the Naval Department Chen Zaofan, Directors of the Two Road Bureaus Huang Boqiao, Director of the Postal Remittance and Savings Bureau Tang Baoshu, Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation Li Jingcong, Manager of China National Aviation Corporation Dai Enji, Counselor of the Military Affairs Commission Zhang Ming, Former Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chen Shiguang, etc. The consuls of various countries in Shanghai included US Consul General Canningham, Consul Macia, French Consul General Meriel, etc., as well as military attachés and counselors from various countries.</p>
<p>Mourning Situation</p>
<p>The guests arrived gradually around 5:40 PM. The German Church rang the alarm bell for 15 minutes at 5:45 PM, and the mourning music followed when the bell stopped at 6:00 PM. First, the pastor read the Bible in German for ten minutes. The memorial service held yesterday was purely a religious ceremony. In order to facilitate the guests' understanding, two amplifiers were specially set up in front of the stage. After the Bible reading, the mourning music started again. Then, German Consul General Kriegebal reported the brief history of former President Hindenburg to the guests in German for ten minutes. After the report, the mourning music was played again, and the guests stood up and paid their respects to the spirit.</p>
<h3>Report by German Consul General Kriegebal (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</h3>
<p>The National Socialist Party members present stood upright and raised their right hands, extending forward to salute. Then the pastor gave a speech praising the merits of President Hindenburg. Finally, the guests sang the German elegy in unison and dispersed at 6:45 PM. The memorial time lasted for one hour. The atmosphere at the venue was extremely solemn.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia's Attitude Towards Germany</h3>
<p>Russian Consulate Pays Condolences for the Death of the German President</p>
<p>The German Consulate-General Attaches Great Importance to It</p>
<p>The Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia last year, the Soviet Russian Consulate-General in Shanghai flew a flag at half-mast for the first time today (the 7th) to pay respect to the deceased German President Hindenburg. The personnel of the German Consulate-General in Shanghai attached great importance to this, because this move may indicate that the attitude of the Soviet Russian government towards Germany has turned warmer. The Soviet Russian Consulate has always been indifferent to the representatives of the German Socialist Party government stationed in Shanghai. After the news of the death of President Hindenburg spread, the Russian Consul-General and other personnel of the consulate visited the German Consulate-General across the street to offer condolences.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Will Strike Shanghai</h3>
<p>Two Hurricanes Have Merged</p>
<p>Began to Blow Last Night</p>
<p>Will Reach Shanghai Today</p>
<p>According to a report from the Observatory, the hurricane was at 6:00 AM yesterday at 128 degrees East longitude, 27 degrees North latitude. The range of the hurricane is sixty nautical miles around, pushing Northwest-West. North of Norway Island, the centers of the two hurricanes have merged into one. In the afternoon, it was heard that the hurricane was gradually blowing towards the Wenzhou ocean and had a tendency to land on Ningbo. Shanghai-Ningbo liners are still sailing because the wind is still far away. Various ships along the coast of Zhejiang are also operating as usual. Many Nan Hua liners have been avoiding the wind en route.</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News says that according to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory on Tuesday morning, at 6:00 AM the hurricane was about 500 miles from Shanghai and is now proceeding towards Shanghai at a speed of about 13 miles per hour. The temporary hurricane has advanced to the vicinity of 27 degrees North latitude and 128 degrees East longitude, which is in the Ryukyu Islands area. If it continues at the current speed and direction, it may blow to this port on Wednesday afternoon. According to another report from Xujiahui, the current hurricane is the result of two hurricanes merging into one on Monday night at 26 degrees North latitude and 129 degrees East longitude and starting to move towards Shanghai, so the wind force is quite strong, and it is expected that there will be strong winds in this port from the evening of the 7th, and the weather tomorrow will be extremely bad. Because the hurricane is approaching, the second heat wave in this port has greatly declined today (the 7th). The highest temperature today is 94.5 degrees, while yesterday it was as high as 99.5 degrees. According to the phenomenon, the climate in this port seems to have a hope of turning cooler.</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Telegraph Department</p>
<h3>Maintaining National Coal Transportation</h3>
<p>Still Charging at the Old Price</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Railways yesterday, saying: Ministry of Railways: According to a letter from the local Coal Industry Association, we have received a letter from member company Yuan Tai, stating that the Traffic Department of the Two-Way Administration has stipulated that since August 1st, all sixth-class goods and special-priced goods (coal and quicklime, etc.) whose freight rates are the same as or lower than sixth-class goods will be transported by the railway, and the freight rate will be increased by 10%. We believe that the road's implementation of responsible transportation, increased freight volume, and promotion of business demonstrate its determination to reform, and we strongly agree with it. However, we do not quite agree with the price increase. At a time when foreign coal is being dumped, our country's coal has already felt a great threat. If the government does not provide various kinds of relief, then mine owners and coal merchants will frequently face danger. Now, increasing the price in disguise, how can we bear it? We hereby send a special letter to your association requesting that the Ministry of Railways revoke its order and implement the old price, etc. According to this, responsible transportation is the responsibility of the road administration, and the freight rate cannot be increased as a result, causing more hardship to merchants and the people. Therefore, we hereby request that your association be allowed to forward it to the Ministry of Railways, hoping that you will consider the merchants' difficulties, revoke the order, and instruct the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Administrations to continue to charge the old price, in order to maintain national coal and benefit commercial transportation, etc. According to this, the railway's approved implementation of responsible transportation was originally intended to rectify freight transportation and promote its own business. It should not increase freight rates as a result. Moreover, national coal is currently in a period of foreign coal dumping. If the freight is increased again, the cost will inevitably increase accordingly, making it even more difficult to compete with foreign coal, which is not the government's original intention of maintaining national coal. It is reasonable to report the situation by telegram, hoping that your ministry will review and approve it, and order the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations to continue to charge the old price for national coal transportation, which is very fair and convenient. Respectfully, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Suffers Heatstroke in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Unable to Leave Shanghai Within One or Two Days</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, has been staying in Shanghai for many days since his arrival. It is heard that he suddenly suffered from heatstroke the night before last. He rested quietly at his residence yesterday morning and was unable to go to the Central Bank to work. Mao Baikang, a doctor from the Central Bank, was summoned to his residence at about 8:00 yesterday morning to examine him. According to his family, the minister originally planned to leave Shanghai last night and return to Beijing, and then transfer to Lu. Now that he is suddenly ill, it is feared that he will not be able to travel within one or two days.</p>
<p>Wang Kemin</p>
<h3>Repeatedly Postponed Trip to Qingdao</h3>
<p>Leaving Shanghai Today on the Japanese Ship Fengtian Maru</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Wang Kemin, Chief Advisor of the Executive Yuan's Political Reorganization Committee stationed in Ping, who was instructed by Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Reorganization Committee, to stay in Shanghai for negotiations, originally planned to leave Shanghai for Qingdao some time ago to meet with Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council. Later, due to urgent matters to be dealt with, he changed the departure date to this morning on the Puan, a ship of the China Merchants Bureau. Unexpectedly, this morning, due to another matter, he changed the departure date again to this afternoon, on the Fengtian Maru of the Dalian Steamship Company, to Qingdao.</p>

<p>Director of Yunnan Industry Department, Miao Yuntai</p>
<h3>Talking Freely About the Political Situation in Yunnan</h3>
<p>Annual Exports of Tin Amount to 20 Million Yuan</p>
<p>To Improve the Cotton Industry, the Cotton Control Committee Agrees to Send Experts to Preside</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Yunnan is located in a remote area with inconvenient transportation, and people in the country are largely unaware of the local situation. Miao Yuntai, Director of the Industry Department of the province, has come to Shanghai to consult experts on the proposed establishment of a hydropower plant in the province. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him to inquire about the political and economic situation in the province and the development of industrial and commercial construction projects in recent years. The following is a detailed account.</p>
<p>Planning a Power Plant</p>
<p>Miao said that he came to Shanghai this time to consult experts on the proposed plans for the establishment of a hydropower plant in the province. He said that the province has been stable in recent years and the people are happy in their work, so all industrial and commercial enterprises are gradually developing. However, the prerequisite for running a factory is to seek cheap and convenient power. The province currently has only one Shilonba water-gas plant, which supplies 2,000 KW. Because the original power supply is not widespread, most factories use steam engines, and the equipment costs are huge, averaging half of the capital amount, and the daily expenses are also very large. In addition to the efforts of the provincial government to promote it, it is now decided to establish a large-scale hydropower plant. The site has been selected in Fumin County, northwest of the provincial capital Kunming. The place has Tanglangchuan, from Kunming Lake (Dianchi Lake) through Anning and other four counties, and into the Jinsha River. Fumin is located in the upper reaches of Tanglangchuan, and the water is very rapid. The total slope is 56 meters per mile, and the permanent amount is 45 cubic meters per Kezhong. It is estimated that it can supply 40,000 KW, and the total cost is about 20 million. The civil engineering accounts for 80% of it. Fortunately, the people of Yunnan Province believe that this construction project is urgently needed, so the people are willing to contribute to some of the projects, and Yunnan Province is also rich in provincial treasury due to the industrial and commercial development in recent years, so construction can begin as soon as the plan is completed. In the future, the electricity supply will be priced at one cent per KWH, which is only one-sixth of the electricity price in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Smelting Tin Progresses</p>
<p>Yunnan Province has many mountains and abundant mineral deposits, but it is a pity that the goods are abandoned on the ground due to inconvenient transportation. However, Gejiu tin smelting has always been the best in the country, and the number of shipments to London and New York is very large. However, the products of various factories in the past had no standards. Those shipped abroad were first repackaged in Hong Kong and had to be verified and certified by the Hong Kong government before they could be transported to Europe and the United States for sale. After several years of promotion and improvement by the provincial government, significant progress has been made. Now, those shipped to New York and London are transported by rail to Haiphong and directly exported. Those that previously had to be certified by the Hong Kong government can now be directly exported with the provincial government's verification certificate. The value of annual exports is about 20 million yuan, which accounts for a huge percentage of our country's foreign trade, and is also a major gain in the national economy of Yunnan Province. In addition, Gejiu was once a poor village, but now it is an important industrial and commercial center. In addition to the provincial Gejiu Linping Railway, which is connected to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to facilitate transportation, it also has its own radio station to communicate with London and New York via telegram and to negotiate business. Since last year, all tin shipped to Europe and the United States has been communicated between Gejiu and London and New York to form a transaction. This kind of international trade situation is rare in inland towns in our country.</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Situation</p>
<p>Yunnan Province produces many kinds of products, so its people can be self-sufficient in food and clothing, and some of them are exported to various provinces and foreign countries, such as cattle and sheep skins, medicinal materials, mountain products, and tea, which are sold in many provinces. Raw materials for yellow silk, white silk, stone yellow, purple root, and other paints are transported to India and Burma, while miscellaneous grains, vegetables, fruits, etc. are transported to Annam. As for what Yunnan Province imports, such as soap and matches, it can now be made and supplied by itself. However, the largest imports are yarn and building materials, which still rely on Shanghai, accounting for about 90% of the products entering the province. Half of them are raw materials such as cotton yarn and semi-finished products. As for the industrial situation, it is also gradually progressing. In the past, manual looms were mostly rough. Since the import of new-style manual looms, factories in the provincial capital have competed to imitate them. In the past two years, there have been about 800 of these machines. Now, the products are of good quality and the width is wide. The number of knitting machines has also increased to 150 in three years. Other weaving machines, such as sweater machines, have also been imported and are gradually developing. The government is only in a supervisory position and provides assistance. Now, in order to promote the development of general construction, a Simingshi factory will be established to supply low-priced building materials.</p>
<p>Improving the Cotton Industry</p>
<p>Yunnan Province cannot be self-sufficient in cotton yarn raw materials, so the provincial government spares no effort to develop the textile industry. Miao said that he came to Shanghai this time and negotiated with the Cotton Control Committee of the National Economic Council and has reached a considerable solution. The province has already established a Cotton Industry Promotion Committee, and it has been quite effective in improving cotton seeds. At the same time, a spinning and weaving factory will be established to manufacture clothing items. However, the province has undertaken many projects and spent a lot of money. The Cotton Control Committee has agreed to send two experts to preside over this project, and it is hoped that it can provide more economic assistance. The provincial government will also do its best to raise funds to undertake this project.</p>
<p>Highway Construction</p>
<p>Yunnan Province has always been known for its inconvenient transportation, and although there are many rivers in the territory, they are not suitable for shipping due to the rapid mountain waters, so vehicles and horses are used for transportation. In recent years, Shaofu has also actively carried out highway construction. Its highway plan is centered on the provincial capital and distributed to various places. Currently, there are four lines that have been completed and opened to traffic, from the provincial capital to Yuxi, Qujing, Loping, and Liushusha. There are three lines that are scheduled to be completed this year, from the provincial capital to Dongchuan, Kaihua, and Huangcaoba. The one from the provincial capital to Dali is scheduled to be completed next year. On the roads that have been opened to traffic, there is now a provincial public bus company and eight merchant-run companies operating transportation services, so transportation is still relatively convenient. However, Yunnan Province is located in a remote area and is the barrier of the southwest, and its relationship with national defense is very important, so transportation facilities must be convenient. Now that the provincial highways are gradually developing, the construction of railways is even more necessary. It is hoped that the central government can pay attention to it and build it.</p>
<p>Local Stability</p>
<p>Miao also talked about the local security situation. According to him, since the Xinhai Revolution, as the provincial army was dispatched, bandits took the opportunity to rise up. For years, there was no end to the banditry in the province. In the 19th year, Chairman Long unified the military and political affairs and formulated a plan to suppress the bandits, expecting to clear them out in three years. Because of the strict military discipline and the soldiers' dedication, they were cleared out in two years. The local area of the whole province is now stable and the industry is prosperous. Now, the provincial treasury has surplus funds every year to engage in various construction projects. Furthermore, because the currency system in the province is unified, the foreign exchange rate is also low, so the exported goods have made profits and the people are gradually becoming prosperous. However, their standard of living is still low. Miao also told reporters that the province has now established an Economic Committee, which is directly under the provincial government, and has hired experts to design and study various construction projects. All large-scale construction projects must be carefully studied by the committee, and the committee will also conduct surveys and research on the economic organization of the whole province and formulate plans for the government to implement. Miao is expected to stay in Shanghai for one or two weeks before returning to the province.</p>
<h3>Italian Ship Chinese People's Fellow Passengers' General Assembly</h3>
<p>On the Italian ship Conte Verde, which arrived in Shanghai on the 4th of this month, there were Mr. Li Shilin, former Chargé d'Affaires of our country in Chile, Huang Guangrui, Commander-in-Chief of the Guangdong Air Force, Li Pingheng, a representative of our country attending the International Labor Conference, Shao Lizhe's son Shao Suichu, two sons of Liu Hongsheng, Superintendent of China Merchants Bureau, Mr. Song Qiwen of this port, and about 70 other people who returned to China from European and American countries for investigation or study. Li Chargé d'Affaires initiated a fellow passengers' general assembly in order to exchange ideas, connect feelings, and be able to cooperate with each other when serving the country and society in the future, and increase efficiency. The meeting was held on the ship in the Red Sea. Although it was hot and sweaty, almost all the attendees were present. First, Mr. Li announced the purpose of the meeting, introduced each person by name, and then gave speeches and took photos before dispersing. The meeting plans to compile a directory of names and distribute it to everyone for memorial. It is also heard that Mr. Li Chargé d'Affaires has been stationed in Chile for many years and has close contact with journalists. The publication of national news has been extremely convenient, so the country's government and people have a good impression of our country, and the overseas Chinese have also benefited from it. When he returned to China for the public farewell, the chief writers of the country's newspapers entrusted him to ask the domestic newspapers to communicate at any time so that they could publish as much as possible to promote friendship between the two countries. Mr. Li also deeply believes that this move can arouse the sympathy of the South American countries, and our country can rely on it for diplomacy, trade, overseas Chinese affairs, etc. He immediately agreed to the request, so as soon as he reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after going to Beijing tonight, he will visit the newspaper industry in this city to express the previous request, if there are no important official duties.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Holds Board Meeting</p>
<h3>Retroactively Approving the Solution for Rickshaws</h3>
<p>The Guild Reports on the Negotiations and Resolution of the Dispute Between the Two Parties</p>
<p>Mutual Aid Fee of 15,000 Yuan Paid Off, Licenses Issued Today</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the rickshaw dispute between the Public Concession Rickshaw Committee and the rickshaw merchants, which has lasted for more than a month, has been completely resolved after the Shanghai Municipal Council convened a meeting of representatives from both sides on the morning of the 6th. The Shanghai Municipal Council held a special meeting yesterday morning to retroactively approve the agreed solutions. The Rickshaw Guild also issued a statement yesterday on the negotiations and resolution with the Shanghai Municipal Council. The rickshaw merchants are allowed to start receiving licenses, paying donations, and renewing licenses from today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Board Meeting Retroactively Approves Various Points</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office issued a statement regarding the implementation of the new regulations for public rickshaws in the Public Concession. Recently, representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Rickshaw Owners' Guild met on August 6th and agreed on various points, which were submitted to the Board of Directors for resolution on the 7th. The various points are listed below: (1) From August 15th of this year, the highest daily rental price for shared rickshaws is set at 78 cents of silver dollars. In addition, the owner may charge an additional 7 cents of silver dollars per rickshaw, but the owner must first pay 1.50 silver dollars per rickshaw per month to contribute to the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association. (2) Owners may apply for owner certificates and vehicle licenses on or before August 13th. (3) The owner assists the Rickshaw Affairs Committee in determining the list of genuine owners and resolving disputes over rickshaw property, with the aim of resolving such disputes clearly before the end of August. (4) If licenses cannot be issued by August 13th due to rickshaw property disputes, the donation license for July may continue to be used (notify the patrol house) until the new license is issued within the month, but all outstanding license fees and donations must be paid in full when the license is issued in September. (5) The owner must submit the bank receipt for the 1.50 yuan Mutual Aid Association fee before the rickshaw license can be issued. However, the Mutual Aid Association fee for August may be paid by the registered owner in total. The donation office can issue the license after receiving the notice of payment, without the need for each person to present the receipt for verification. (6) The organization of the Board of Directors and Management Department of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association will be revised after eight months. (7) In addition to the existing three directors and seven people hired to guide the use of donations, the aforementioned Management Department will add two representatives elected by registered owners and two representatives elected by registered rickshaw pullers. Before the registration of rickshaw pullers is implemented, Mr. Cheng Xiechun, Chairman of the Jianghuai Guild, will represent the rickshaw pullers. (8) The new style of public rickshaws has been built according to the suggestions of rickshaw owners and pullers. Once completed, it will be publicly exhibited and tested, and opinions for improvement can still be considered. (9) In order to eliminate doubts and misunderstandings about the wording of the public rickshaw regulations, it is specially agreed that (1) the owner who receives the license may be an individual, a rickshaw company, or a guild; (2) the Shanghai Municipal Council reserves the right to decide whether to issue a license at the end of each month, but reasonable convenience will be given to the transfer of vehicles due to buying and selling, or the transfer due to the death of the licensee. However, the new licensee must be a suitable person who is willing to abide by the license regulations and pay the Mutual Aid Association donation. In this case, the Shanghai Municipal Council can handle the license for the transferee or heir.</p>
<p>The Guild Reports on the Resolution Process</p>
<p>Yin Zhiling, a director of the Guild, told a reporter from Xin Xin News Agency yesterday the following resolution process: The Shanghai Municipal Council adopted the report of the Rickshaw Committee to suggest 13 items, and established the Rickshaw Affairs Management Committee to implement improved vehicles and aid rickshaw pullers, with the aim of serving society and education. Considering that aiding rickshaw pullers is a social problem of improving the lives of more than 100,000 people, we have contributed opinions to the Special Zone Rickshaw Owners' Congress, advocating the construction of hospitals and new villages to seek the health and improvement of rickshaw pullers' lives. The congress adopted it on the spot and decided that each owner should first raise 50,000 yuan as preparation. Later, the Rickshaw Affairs Management Committee hastily ordered new regulations to be implemented to improve vehicles, which differed greatly from the opinions of the rickshaw merchants, so that the rickshaw merchants were busy improving vehicles to cope with the Rickshaw Committee and had no time to take care of the rickshaw pullers' aid business, causing the hospital and new village plan to be suspended invisibly. Since the beginning of July, the Rickshaw Committee announced the establishment of a Mutual Aid Association, collecting mutual aid fees of 1.50 yuan per vehicle per day, as a plan to aid rickshaw pullers, and announced new regulations such as changing the appearance of vehicles and reducing rickshaw rentals, which aroused a strong reaction from the rickshaw merchants, who proposed to the fifth congress of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the first special zone rickshaw owners' congress, unanimously expressing their firm opposition to accepting the new regulations proposed by the Rickshaw Committee, and refused to receive the owner's certificate to show their determination. The Rickshaw Committee then announced that it would not issue certificates without licenses to show its strength. As a result, the trend of the two sides insisting on the issue of aiding rickshaw pullers made the rickshaw pullers risk losing their jobs. This is not the blessing of the place. I then visited Mr. Fei Xindun, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and met with him to discuss the transfer and consultation of the Rickshaw Committee to postpone the license for 10 days. On one side, Mr. Cheng Xiechun asked Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director, to mediate and accompany the representatives of the rickshaw merchants to the Rickshaw Committee for mediation, but it was ineffective to postpone the implementation of the new regulations. The rickshaw merchants then submitted a petition to the Board of Directors, but the request for reconsideration was not approved, which made the rickshaw problem increasingly serious. The Rickshaw Committee insisted that the new regulations had been passed by the Board of Directors and had been applied for reconsideration and amendment by the rickshaw merchants, so it had its reasons to insist on implementation. However, the rickshaw merchants believed that the new regulations proposed by the Rickshaw Committee did not take into account the commercial situation and were difficult to accept. In addition to calling on social groups to uphold justice and provide assistance, they only had to prepare to suspend business and fight. Fortunately, Mr. Zhong Si, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, returned to Shanghai from vacation and learned about the difficulties of the rickshaw merchants. After several meetings with me, he agreed to negotiate and resolve the dispute between the rickshaw merchants and the Rickshaw Committee. Zhong Si then convened a meeting of representatives of rickshaw merchants and representatives of the Bureau, the Director-General, the Chief Patrol, the Chairman of the Rickshaw Committee, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director, and Mr. He Dekui, a co-organizer, for two meetings, and then the dispute between the two sides, which had lasted for more than a month, was largely resolved. The method (which has been detailed in yesterday's newspaper) was approved by the temporary Board of Directors yesterday afternoon and retroactively approved. The decided methods, such as rent reduction and pre-payment of mutual aid fees, must be implemented after the 15th of this month. On the owner's side, because of the contractual relationship with the undertakers, how to reduce the amount appropriately to comply with the new regulations and benefit the rickshaw pullers, although there are many difficulties, but in order to aid the rickshaw pullers and for the sake of the peaceful resolution of disputes concerned by all sectors, the party should painfully accept the agreement and implement it. The mutual aid fees to be paid this month have been paid by the guild on behalf of the saved aid funds to reduce the burden on the owners and start implementing rent reduction. The most unsatisfactory saying that the Mutual Aid Association is not allowed for rickshaw merchants to participate in the management has been cancelled, and the rickshaw merchants are allowed to elect representatives to participate. The trial period is set at eight months, which is not long, and we should quietly observe the results of the organizers. As for improving the appearance of the vehicles, the opinions of the owners should be sought, and the principle should be practicality, solidity, and cleanliness, not extravagance. Other points where the new regulations differ from the old regulations have been explained by the chairman of the meeting, and it has been decided that there is no intention to deliberately harm the legal rights of the owners. When difficulties are encountered in implementation, they can be discussed. In short, the rickshaw merchants are very concerned by various groups, such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, various industry guilds, newspapers, news agencies, and other social groups, and the Bureau, the Director-General, the Chief Patrol, the co-organizer, and the Chinese director. In particular, Mr. Zhong Si, Yu Qiaqing, and He Dekui helped to mediate, so that the dispute between the rickshaw owners and the Rickshaw Committee could be resolved through a meeting and negotiation, and they were spared from being forced to suspend business, affecting the livelihood of the rickshaw pullers and social peace. I am deeply grateful. This dispute has made all sectors understand that the rickshaw problem is not only related to the rickshaw industry, but also a major social problem. I hope that the owners will work hard to improve and cooperate sincerely with the rickshaw affairs agencies of the Shanghai Municipal Council to jointly help solve this major social problem.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Merchants Start Receiving Licenses Today</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Industry Guild, with the various issues having been resolved to a considerable extent, specially notified its members yesterday to receive the lower portion of the application form issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and prepare to start receiving new certificates from the Rickshaw Committee today, and then go to the donation office to pay donations and receive business licenses for August. At that time, the Rickshaw Merchants' Guild will send personnel to assist the Rickshaw Committee in handling the license matters in accordance with the resolution. The total amount of 15,000 yuan for the 1.50 yuan mutual aid fee that each rickshaw owner should pay this month has been paid on behalf of the saved aid funds by the guild and temporarily kept by the Shanghai Municipal Council. It will be taken over as soon as the Mutual Aid Fee Custody Committee is established.</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Chairman of the Rickshaw Committee, Maxi, expressed his passivity because his personal opinions could not be realized, and decided to resign after the establishment of the Mutual Aid Fee Custody Committee.</p>

<p>Cotton Control Commission Loaned 300,000</p>
<h3>To Transport and Sell Cotton Products from Northwest China</h3>
<p>Rumors of 3 Million Dollars are Inaccurate</p>
<p>According to the "New News Agency," the National Economic Committee's Cotton Control Commission, in order to find ways to transport and sell cotton produced in Northwest China, specially borrowed 300,000 yuan from six banks in Shanghai, namely, the Bank of China, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Jin Cheng Bank, and the Four Provinces Farmers Bank, with each bank lending 50,000 yuan. The rumor of 3 million yuan is inaccurate. The loan contract has already been drafted, with an interest rate of 9%. This amount has been handed over to the Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute of the Cotton Control Commission for lending to farmers in various regions to transport cotton from various regions to Shanghai for sale, it is said.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Government Regarding Disaster Relief</p>
<h3>Replied to Fellow Townsmen from Haiyan in Shanghai by Telegram</h3>
<p>Expressed Acceptance of Suggestions from Zhu Fengwei and Others</p>
<p>Zhu Fengwei, Zhu Yaoting, Zhang Tongsheng, and other fellow townsmen from Haiyan in Shanghai, due to the severe drought in their hometown, telegraphed Lu Yong'an, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, and Lü Qüsūn, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, on the 31st of last month, requesting relief and urging the use of the Ding Cao grain to relieve the disaster-stricken people. Now, Zhu and others have received a reply from Chairman Lu and others, expressing acceptance of the appeals and suggestions of Zhu and others. The original telegram reads: "To Mr. Zhu Fengwei of the Shanghai Municipal Government and all gentlemen, your telegram has been respectfully received. We admire your deep concern for your hometown. Since the beginning of summer, the province has experienced a long period of clear and dry weather. The provincial government has already instructed all counties to consider local conditions, concentrate efforts, and take effective measures for relief and irrigation of farmland. All relief funds needed are allowed to be used from local public funds as much as possible. It is also instructed to consider the situation, guide farmers to find ways to replant, or plant suitable drought-resistant crops to make up for the loss. Subsequently, according to the county magistrate's telegram reporting the replanting situation and proposing a method for lending grain, the provincial government successively ordered the rapid preparation of drought-resistant crop seeds and instructed the release of stored grain from warehouses to help poor farmers. As for the exemption of land tax, it will be handled separately after assessing the situation in the autumn. We hereby reply. [Seal of] Lu Dipíng, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Lü Bìchóu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department."</p>
<p>Cotton Trade Association</p>
<h3>Discussing Regulations to Ban Adulteration</h3>
<p>Requesting Consistent Action with Manufacturers</p>
<p>The Cotton Trade Association of this city held its third executive supervisory committee meeting yesterday. Considering that the regulations to ban the adulteration of cotton have been promulgated and implemented, and that improving the quality of goods is an urgent task, they decided to telegraph the Cotton Control Commission for adoption of their original proposal. The original proposal is as follows: "To the esteemed Cotton Control Commission, we have respectfully received the promulgated Regulations on Banning Cotton Adulteration. Articles 8 and 9 state that for cotton sold on term or spot, if the content of cottonseeds and other impurities exceeds 0.05% of the standard cotton agreed upon by both parties or officially designated, its sale and use should be suspended, and a deduction should be made at double the percentage. Upon close examination, the terms 'officially designated standard' differ significantly from the clear regulations on the maximum moisture content in Article 2. In the future, sales will inevitably lead to many disputes. We believe that before the official standard is issued by the ministry, 0.05% should be temporarily considered as natural impurities, with a maximum limit of no more than 2%. If it exceeds 2%, its sale and use should be suspended. If it is between 0.05% and 2%, a price deduction should be made. In this way, sales will have a basis and there will be no disputes. It has been found that cotton merchants in this city sell most of the cotton transported from various regions to spinning mills. The weighing after water baking and the handling of seeds are all decided by the mills. If there is any discrepancy, there is no room for public judgment. For the sake of business safety, the association proposes that in the future, if there are discrepancies in samples, moisture content, impurities, or weighing in spot cotton or term cotton transactions between manufacturers and cotton merchants, the association should report to request impartial judgment to resolve disputes. Furthermore, cotton merchants who set up shops to purchase cotton mostly supply spinning mills, which is no different from spinning mills setting up their own shops. However, cotton merchants are required to pay business tax, while spinning mills are not, which does not seem to be equal. It is requested that cotton merchants who set up shops to purchase cotton in the producing areas be exempt from business tax, just like manufacturers setting up shops, in order to show equality. The esteemed commission is in a high position, and all cotton farmers and merchants are under the control of the esteemed commission. We boldly submit the above three matters and humbly request that you consider the difficulties faced by cotton merchants in their business, approve our requests, and instruct the Spinning Mills Association to implement them uniformly to show fairness and eliminate disputes. We anxiously await your orders."</p>
<p>The Stamp Tax Bureau Will Commence</p>
<h3>Dispatching Personnel to Conduct Stamp Tax Inspections from Today</h3>
<p>Wearing Badges and Working with the Police</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Sub-Bureau originally planned to implement the stamp tax by means of persuasion and inspection. However, the Shangbao jurisdiction is vast, and persuasion is insufficient. Although many people comply, there are still occasional instances of those who try to be clever, such as avoiding the use of invoices for business transactions or using disguised invoices to deceive. Such behavior is very detrimental to the future of national taxation. The bureau has specifically decided to dispatch personnel wearing badges and working with the local police to conduct random inspections starting today. At the same time, a letter will be sent to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, urging all businesses to comply, it is said.</p>
<p>Resistance Against Japan</p>
<h3>Disabled Veterans Request Relief</h3>
<p>Unable to Meet with Ma and Rebuffed by Wu, Their Plight is Intolerable</p>
<p>Xinwei Association Provided Funds to Send Them to Beijing on the Jianghua Steamer</p>
<p>Yesterday, seven disabled veterans, including Yao Ziyu, who were subordinates of General Ma Zhanshan, a hero in the resistance against Japan, came to the Xinwei Relief Association. Originally from the Northeast, they followed Ma in resisting Japan after the September 18th Incident and were wounded, becoming disabled and unable to make a living. They came to Shanghai at the end of last month to meet with Ma and plead for some relief. However, Ma had gone to Lushan to escape the summer heat. In recent days, they repeatedly visited Ma's representative, Wu Huanzhang, at 13 Lafayette Road, but were refused entry. They had no food or lodging. They were staying at the Daxin Hotel but were evicted for owing room rent. All their belongings were seized by the hotel. With no food or lodging, they were in a desperate situation. Unable to meet with Ma and rebuffed by Wu, Yao and the other six men went to the Xinwei Relief Association on Yunnan Road yesterday to plead for relief and to be sent to Beijing. The Xinwei Association sent staff member Ge Yünsūn to investigate. After confirming the situation, the association, out of compassion for their service to the country and to prevent them from becoming vagrants, paid for their room and board, issued seven free steamer tickets, and gave them some travel expenses. They were escorted to the China Merchants Wharf and boarded the Jianghua steamer at 7:00 AM yesterday to go to Beijing.</p>
<p>Taxpaying Chinese Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<h3>Should Order Public Buses to Improve</h3>
<p>Importance Should be Attached to Pedestrian Safety</p>
<p>Install Equipment such as Safety Bumpers</p>
<p>According to the "New Voice News Agency," the Taxpaying Chinese Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement yesterday, which read: "With regard to the case of Mr. Tao Anren being hit by a public bus, we previously received your reply stating that no fault could be found with the public bus and that any claims for damages should be negotiated directly with the bus company. We immediately informed him. Now, we have received a reply from Mr. Tao Leqin, secretary of our association, stating that the bicycle ridden by the child Anren at the time of the accident had its rear wheel completely crushed and is still stored at the Zhenxiangji Bicycle Shop for investigation. We believe that if the child had strayed from the road or had been careless and had run into the public bus, the front wheel should have been damaged. The fact that the front wheel is undamaged and the rear wheel is completely crushed undoubtedly shows that the public bus</p>
<p>did not sound its horn. Although there were no witnesses at the time, the material evidence is very clear. However, the Public Works Department stated that no fault could be found with the public bus. We do not know on what basis this statement was made. It has been observed that when rickshaws or other vehicles on the road hit pedestrians, the people involved are always taken to the police station for punishment or ordered to pay compensation, all according to appropriate procedures. However, with public buses, not only is no action taken, but the Public Works Department even tries to cover up for them by saying that no fault can be found. Such phenomena lead people to believe that the Public Works Department is biased. Regarding the public bus company, the Public Works Department states that all public buses that have not been used have been inspected by the police department and that the drivers have also received adequate training. In this way, it can be said that the Public Works Department is doing its utmost to care for the public bus company. Unfortunately, the bus company does not live up to expectations and often disregards the Public Works Department's words. For example, on the 27th of last month, a Route 10 public bus drove into</p>
<p>the outpatient department of the Tongren Hospital while traveling on West Seward Road. Instead of taking a damaged bus to the garage for repair, it was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Is this not a great joke? The Public Works Department has said that news reports of public bus accidents are based on newspaper rumors. However, on the 13th of last month, a public bus on Route _ killed three people at the entrance of the Rongguang Cinema due to straying from the road. On the 21st of the same month, the driver of the public bus, Wu Jintang, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the First Special District Local Court. Can this official ruling be considered a rumor from the newspapers? In short, the defective construction of public buses hinders public order and</p>
<p>endangers pedestrians, which is an undeniable fact. The Public Works Department may choose not to ban them, but it should not pursue short-term benefits at the expense of the long-term interests of the public. Most of those injured by public buses are poor people who struggle to make a living and have no extra strength or time to fight against the powerful and well-connected public bus company. However, accumulated grievances will inevitably lead to bad consequences. Therefore, as a precaution, the Public Works Department should urgently improve the construction of public buses or add preventive measures. To say that such safety devices cannot be purchased from countries around the world is simply an excuse. After all, are all the facilities in the concession available in all countries? We believe that things should be created according to needs. In the past, trams and trolleybuses in the concession</p>
<p>did not have iron gates. At the beginning of their use, passengers complained about the delay caused by opening and closing them. At that time, foreign newspapers also criticized them. However, the Public Works Department disregarded public opinion and insisted on installing them, all to prevent problems before they occur. Why does the Public Works Department remain indifferent to the safety devices of public buses and refuse to find ways to prevent disasters, allowing them to crash and kill people at will? Is it because they fear the consequences of hitting a rat for fear of breaking the vase? We believe that, at the very least, ordinary cars have smaller wheels than public buses, but they all have safety bumpers installed in the front and rear. Public buses have two wheels protruding in the front, but they have no protection at all. Pedestrians are easily</p>
<p>rolled under the wheels if they are hit. Therefore, at a minimum, public buses should also be equipped with safety bumpers, and their effectiveness should be extended to improve them. This does not have to wait until countries around the world have new inventions before it can be imitated. If even this cannot be done, then those who are responsible for supervising public utilities are simply holding their positions without doing their jobs, following established routines, and failing to live up to the expectations of taxpayers. How can they justify themselves? Fortunately, the child was not killed in this accident caused by the British public bus. Although the loss is great, for the sake of public safety, we ask the Public Works Department to order the public bus company to make better arrangements for safety as a result of this incident. Even if the pain is remembered, it will be enough. We respectfully ask your council to forward a letter to the Public Works Department, ordering the public bus company to quickly find ways to improve preventive measures to protect people's lives, for which we will be endlessly grateful. As for whether the public bus company should</p>
<p>compensate for the losses, there will be fair and just opinions from impartial authorities. We will not go into detail here, "and even if we did, it would be of little effect," and so on. It is undeniable that the defective construction of public buses leads to careless driving. Mr. Tao's statement that, at a minimum, they should be equipped with safety bumpers is a fair and reasonable argument. We do not know why your council is so favorable to public buses and must protect them. Based on the information in the letter, we are sending this letter again to inform you and hope that you will attach importance to the safety of taxpaying citizens when walking, inform the British public bus company to quickly find ways to improve and prevent accidents, and refrain from making strong arguments and defenses, so as to comply with expectations. We still hope to receive a reply. This is addressed to the General Manager of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement.</p>
<p>Dada-Datong Steamship Company</p>
<h3>Handling Joint Transportation of Passengers and Goods</h3>
<p>Connecting Point is Yangzhou</p>
<p>Implementation Set for the 13th</p>
<p>The Dada Steamship Company, which operates the Shanghai-Yangzhou line, and the Datong Steamship Bureau, which operates the Huojiaqiao-Qingjiangpu line, will handle joint transportation of passengers and goods, starting on the 13th of this month. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Transportation</p>
<p>The Dada Steamship Company's ships on the Shanghai-Yangzhou line, such as the Daqing, Dayu, and Dahe, operate once a day from Shanghai and Yangzhou. Now, to facilitate the rapid movement of passengers and goods, they will cooperate with the Datong Steamship Bureau, which operates between Huojiaqiao and Qingjiangpu. The connecting point is in Yangzhou. Dada and Datong are both authorized to issue joint transportation tickets. The contract has been signed and will be implemented starting on the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>Connecting Ships</p>
<p>The Datong Steamship Bureau has specially prepared three shallow-draft, small, fast steamships and towed barges, which will depart from Huojiaqiao and Qingjiangpu once a day to connect with the Dada Steamship Company's ships. Passengers traveling from Shanghai to Shaobo, Gaoyou, Jieshou, Sishui, Pingqiao, Baoying, Huaicheng, Qingjiangpu, etc., or from the above locations to Shanghai, can purchase joint transportation tickets. Goods can also be jointly transported. Now, it has been changed to small, fast steamships for towing, it is said.</p>
<p>A New Contribution to Medical Supplies</p>
<h3>Invention of Domestically Produced Silk Suture</h3>
<p>Excellent Results After Use by Doctors</p>
<p>Also Available are Silk Cross-Stitch Thread and Thread Balls</p>
<p>Cross-stitch thread and thread balls are needlework items needed by every household. However, most of the ones sold in the market are foreign goods. In addition, the sutures used for various medical purposes are all imported from Japan. The annual outflow of funds is considerable. Now, Mr. Zhang Zhilan, owner of the Deda Silk Thread Shop outside the Dadongmen in this city, after ten years of research, has invented medical sutures using domestically produced silk. He has produced four types of sterilized silk sutures for wound closure, namely, British-American style, German-Japanese style, flat silk suture, and sterilized catgut suture. After the invention, doctors in Shanghai were asked to try them, and they were considered to be comparable to imported products and even better than Japanese goods. As a result, major pharmacies such as Wuzhou and Zhongying have placed orders, and there are also orders from other cities. Mr. Zhang is very pleased and believes that since he has made contributions to domestic products and medicine, he should establish a large-scale organization and immediately set up the Deda Mechanized Chemical Household Medical Silk Thread Factory at the original Deda site to use silk and regain profits. On the one hand, he also invented Double Cross brand silk cross-stitch thread and silk thread balls, six-strand embroidery thread, and Gaiquan silk thread. They are suitable for all kinds of silk and cloth. They can be used for embroidery and for knotting objects. The quality is softer, smoother, and never fades compared to imported cotton cross-stitch thread and thread balls, and the price is also cheaper. He has now applied to the Trademark Bureau for special registration. For the convenience of viewing by all sectors, he has opened a Deda East Branch at 1 Jiangxi Road, displaying various samples, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hu Wenhu Established Two Newspapers in Guangzhou and Xiamen</h3>
<p>Airplanes and Automobiles Used to Deliver Newspapers</p>
<p>In addition to being enthusiastic about various charitable and public welfare activities, Mr. Hu Wenhu, owner of Tiger Balm Yong'an Hall, is also working hard in cultural undertakings. Five years ago, he invested 500,000 yuan to establish the Sin Chew Daily in Singapore, which is read by overseas Chinese for its fair opinions and accurate reporting, and its circulation is quite wide. Three years ago, he also established the Sing Hua Daily in Shantou, which is also very popular among people in eastern Guangdong and overseas Chinese. It is recently heard that Mr. Hu believes that Guangzhou is the political and economic center of the south, and Xiamen is the gateway for overseas Chinese from Fujian, and that it is necessary to establish newspapers in both cities to communicate information. He has decided to invest 400,000 yuan in Guangzhou to establish the Sing Yue Daily and 200,000 yuan in Xiamen to establish the Sing Kwong Daily. He is currently sending personnel to prepare separately. In the future, after publication, the Sing Yue Daily will purchase two airplanes, and the Sing Kwong Daily will purchase multiple automobiles to facilitate rapid delivery of newspapers, it is said.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of the People's Sanatorium</h3>
<p>Renowned physicians in this city, Yang Zhongfu, Gao Jiren, Zhou Yunjun, and others, in view of the large number of residents in Shanghai and the lack of suitable institutions for civilians to treat their illnesses, raised a huge sum of money to establish the People's Sanatorium at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road. They aimed to provide relief to the poor and sick and to promote the health of the community.

<p>Yan Ziliang's Case of Selling Poisonous Substances</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Remanded the Case for Retrial</h3>
<p>During the summer of last year, the San Francisco Nanyang Branch busted an international narcotics trafficking organization, arresting the Westerner Jussi Esla Erin (transliteration), and other cases, involving Yan Ziliang, owner of the former Yanda Sheng Pharmacy in this city, a Ningbo native. The French Concession Police sent Chinese and Western detectives to search Yan's home at No. 8, Huanlong Villa, Huanlong Road, and seized several pounds of red pills, manufacturing equipment, and books. Yan was arrested and transferred to the Second Special District Local Court, where he was prosecuted under Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law. During the investigation, Yan, due to old age and illness, requested bail, which was approved with a deposit of 5,000 yuan in cash plus a surety of 10,000 yuan to be available at any time. Subsequently, two confectionery stores and one bathhouse were jointly responsible for guaranteeing his release. After the trial, Yan Ziliang was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and a fine of 4,000 yuan. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yan, dissatisfied with the original verdict, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. As a result, due to insufficient grounds and evidence for the appeal, the appeal was dismissed. During this period, Yan was also sued for alimony by his daughter-in-law, Ms. Zhang, in the Second Special Court. Yan did not appear, and his son posted a notice in the newspaper to find him, but Yan still refused to appear. The public knew that Yan was evading the law. At this time, the Third Branch of the High Court summoned Yan for questioning regarding the case, but he refused to appear. Therefore, it was decided to confiscate his 5,000 yuan cash deposit and order the three guarantors to pay the 10,000 yuan surety they had undertaken. As the three guarantors were unable to pay, the three stores were closed and auctioned off to cover the debt. Now, regarding the drug manufacturing case, the Supreme Court has reviewed the entire file and believes that there are still doubts in the case. Therefore, it has ruled to revoke the original judgment and remand the case to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for retrial. It is heard that the Third Branch of the High Court has received the case file from the higher authorities and will soon schedule a hearing for witnesses and evidence.</p>

<p>Rent Reduction Association</p>
<h3>Commendation for Voluntary Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>And Appealing for Tenants</p>
<p>The city's Rent Reduction Committee yesterday sent letters to the board of directors of the Dongting Xishan Jinting Guild Hall, commending their voluntary rent reduction, and also sent a letter to the Taichang Real Estate Association, asking them not to use coercive measures against tenants. The two letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) To the Jinting Guild Hall: On the 3rd of this month, we received your board of directors' 11th official letter, stating that in recent years, the Shanghai market has been sluggish, and the people's economy has been in extreme decline. In particular, housing problems are crucial to people's livelihood. Therefore, the guild hall has decided to voluntarily reduce the rent for all 35 city-owned houses on Daxing Street and Lujiabang Road outside Xiaoximen, in line with the trend. The rent will be collected at a 10% discount along Daxing Street and a 5% discount along Lujiabang Road, to enhance the relationship between landlords and tenants and to reduce the burden on tenants. We have received and approved this. We have investigated and found that the previous market decline was indeed caused by high rents. Your guild hall has been able to understand the suffering and has spared no effort to initiate voluntary rent reductions to ease the burden on citizens. This committee is deeply impressed. In addition to publishing this in the newspapers, we hereby respond to your guild hall for your information and deep appreciation.</p>
<p>(2) To the Taichang Company: Recently, we received a letter from the Xielongfang branch of the 21st branch of this committee, stating that according to a report from member Dagguangming Gift Company, they received a letter from the landlord Taichang Real Estate Company, stating that they owed five months' rent and had repeatedly failed to pay, and demanded that all overdue rent be paid within five days, otherwise, legal action would be taken to evict them. We have received and approved the request for your assistance. It has been found that the tenants in that neighborhood previously organized a branch because of the market decline, requesting your company to appropriately reduce the rent to alleviate their burden, and it is not an arbitrary default on rent, nor is it the individual behavior of Dagguangming. Now your company accuses Dagguangming of failing to pay rent and imposes a five-day deadline for payment, otherwise, legal action will be taken to pursue eviction, which is contrary to the facts. The sluggishness of the Shanghai market and the high rents are undeniable facts. Landlords should be motivated by their conscience to voluntarily reduce rents to ease the burden on citizens, hoping for the market to recover. Your company is willing to risk being unjust in the midst of the people's livelihood decline and impose pressure, which is deeply regrettable. Moreover, the tenants in that neighborhood are delaying rent payment pending a resolution to the rent reduction issue, and it is not just Dagguangming alone. It is even more incomprehensible why your company is singling out Dagguangming for pressure. This committee follows the principle of seeking peaceful resolutions and sincerely hopes that your company will act according to its conscience and voluntarily reduce rents, so that all problems can be solved easily. Otherwise, where justice lies, it is by no means something that can be controlled by coercive means. We hereby send this letter for your information.</p>
<p>Wenzhou Rush Mat Industry</p>
<h3>Forming a Production and Sales Cooperative</h3>
<p>Extensive Sales in the South Seas</p>
<p>According to news released yesterday by the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, soft mats are a necessity for families in summer. In addition to being used as bed mats, they can also be used as furniture cushions, making them very versatile. Since factories were established in Tianjin, Ningbo, and other places, Japanese goods are rarely seen in the market.</p>
<h3>Yang Yulou Slaughters His Own Son with His Own Hands</h3>
<p>Believing that the next child born could be saved</p>
<p>The child was cut eight times and the condition was extremely tragic</p>
<p>Yang Yulou, from Qingjiang, is currently 38 years old and works as a laborer at the Fufeng Flour Mill on Moganshan Road. He lives with his wife, Zhang, at No. 15 Beiyinghua Lane, Roberts Road. Since their marriage, they have had eight children, both male and female, but all of them died one after another. On the second day of this lunar month, Yang Zhang gave birth to another son, named Xiaoliuzi. Unexpectedly, within ten days, Xiaoliuzi suddenly became seriously ill. Although he was treated, it was ineffective. On the day before yesterday (the 25th), Yang, seeing that Xiaoliuzi's illness had reached an incurable state and being extremely superstitious, believed that he had given birth to eight children in total, none of whom survived. According to custom, if a child is killed with a knife before death, the next child born will surely be preserved. Therefore, Yang took his son, who was only 23 days old, out in his arms at 1:30 PM on the 25th, secretly carrying a sharp blade. When he arrived at the wasteland on Xiaoshadu Road, he cut the child eight times all over his body, including two cuts on the neck, one cut each on the chest and abdomen, two cuts on the right side of the face, and one cut each on the little finger and ring finger of the right hand, and the fingers were severed. The situation was extremely tragic. He then placed the knife beside the child and returned. Shortly after, a Chinese constable, No. 2912, from the Putuo Police Station, passed by and saw the child bleeding profusely but not yet dead. He immediately reported to the police station by phone. Detective Shi Si and Detective Tan Jinhai rushed to the scene with an ambulance and took the child to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They also investigated the cause of the incident in detail. Later, they found the nursing mother, Xie Shi, and took her to the hospital. Xie Shi identified the child as Xiaoliuzi, born to Yang Yulou. Due to the severity of the injuries, he died in the hospital at 9:15 PM the night before. The body was sent to the autopsy station on Ferren Road, and Yang was arrested, taken to the police station, and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the criminal court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin described the incident and filed charges of premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Code and abandonment under Article 310, requesting a postponement. The murder weapon was presented for inspection. According to the testimony of witness Xie Shi, Yang Zhang stated that Xiaoliuzi was only 23 days old and suffered from a severe illness. The medicine was ineffective, and he died. Therefore, her husband, Yang Yulou, took him out. However, she did not know about the knife attack. When questioned, Yang Yulou confessed that because eight children had been born before and none had survived, and this child was also suffering from illness and was already dead, he cut the child with a knife, hoping that the next child born would be preserved. He claimed that the child was already dead when he took him out. He requested an appraisal. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession and ordered Yang to be detained for further questioning on another day. The detectives then took Yang down and escorted him to the autopsy station. The prosecutor and forensic doctor arrived at the station to examine the body and ordered it to be placed in a coffin.</p>
<p>The triangular rush soft mat is a specialty of the Jiangbei shore of Wenzhou, with an annual output of approximately 300,000 yuan. In addition to being sold domestically, it is very popular in the South Seas and Singapore. Currently, in order to reduce intermediate profits and improve products, the producers in that area have formed a rush mat production and sales cooperative. The members directly plant, weave, print, flatten, and transport the mats themselves. Business commenced on July 20. The sales discount is 40% off the market price for ordinary mats and 55% off the market price for special mats. The prices are extremely low. Businesses wishing to act as distributors can contact the cooperative directly on the Jiangbei shore of Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Procurement in India</p>
<h3>Our Country's Peas and Soybeans</h3>
<p>Letter requesting introduction from the International Trade Bureau</p>
<p>Peas and soybeans are specialties of our country, and the annual export volume is quite large. Currently, the Enlida Company in Mumbai, India, needs these commodities and has sent a letter requesting an introduction from the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry. Exporters who wish to promote these commodities abroad are requested to promptly notify the Guidance Department of the bureau so that it can be forwarded to the company for procurement.</p>
<p>Passenger Ding Boquan from Puan Drowned Tragically While Swimming in Putuo</p>
<h3>Transporting the body back to Shanghai for funeral arrangements</h3>
<p>The Puan, a steamer of the China Merchants Bureau's Putuo route, made a special trip to Putuo last Saturday, with a full load of passengers. Even the吊舖 were sold out. Because this trip stayed in Putuo for an extra day, tourists could enjoy an extra day of sightseeing. In the afternoon of the 6th, most of the passengers on the boat were swimming in the sea to refresh themselves, but unexpectedly, a tragedy occurred. Among the passengers was Ding Boquan, an employee of the Fuchang Tobacco Company in Shanghai, who also took the Puan special trip to Putuo for sightseeing. In the afternoon of the 6th, Ding and his friends went to the beach to bathe in the sea. Ding was skilled in swimming. The first time Ding swam, he was washed to the beach by a wave. Ding bravely swam out again for the second time and was washed back in by the second wave. His friends advised him not to swim, saying that the waves were powerful and different from other places. Ding did not believe it. The third time he swam out, he was violently hit by a wave. Ding was unable to support himself, his head was planted upside down in the water, and his feet were facing the sky. In an instant, he was lost. His friend was anxious. Then a wave came and washed his body back to the shore. His friend carried Ding's body to the shore and reported it to the crew. They urgently used artificial respiration to save him, but it was too late. Ding did not inhale much water, but his heart had stopped beating. In less than thirty minutes, he died. The body was carried onto the ship and taken back to Shanghai. The Puan steamer left Putuo on the evening of the 6th and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. Ding died from swimming, and his body was transported back to Shanghai. Upon arrival, it was reported to the Sea Port Quarantine Office as usual and doctors boarded the ship to inspect and confirm that there was no error. After the ship docked at Huazhan, the family of the deceased was notified to send someone to the ship to move the body for burial. According to people on the ship, the waves in Putuo are even stronger than those in Qingdao. Last year, a total of one Westerner and two Chinese tourists died from swimming in Putuo.</p>
<p>Aviation Salvation Walking Propaganda Group</p>
<h3>Departed for Songjiang Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Gave Eleven Sets of Uniforms</p>
<p>The China National Promotion of Aviation Salvation Walking National Propaganda Group left Shanghai for Zhejiang at 9:35 yesterday morning. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Sleeping in the Open All Night Since the group arrived in Shanghai from Beijing last month, they have worked hard to publicize through radio stations and mass organizations. Now that the work is completed, they will go to Zhejiang for publicity according to the planned schedule. The day before yesterday afternoon, the head of the group, Chen Zhenglong, and members Ding Renjie gathered at the North Railway Station overnight, sleeping in the open all night, without any distress. This is enough to prove the admirable spirit of the entire group.</p>
<p>Departing in Batches The group believed that the accommodation problem was extremely important when first arriving in a new place. Therefore, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, they first sent members Yang Xinhua, Gu Siyi, Fan Yuzhong, and others to Songjiang along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Road to ask the local party headquarters for accommodation. Members Zhong Qing and Leng Gaoyun fell ill due to the unbearable heat, so they transferred to Beijing for medical treatment last night.</p>
<p>Fiancé Breaking the Engagement and Abandoning</p>
<h3>Deeply Grieving Young Lady Takes Her Life</h3>
<p>The girl's father painfully recounts the events and blames himself</p>
<p>Virtuous and chaste, she transcends the world with sorrow and indignation</p>
<p>Yao Jikang, from Zhoupu, had a daughter named Wenxian, who had reached the age of marriage. Since childhood, she had been betrothed through a matchmaker to Cao Chengyuan, the son of Cao Zhenyu Tea Shop, known as "Young Wen Cao." However, the Cao family advocated freedom and was greatly dissatisfied with the marriage to the Yao girl arranged by her parents. He had threatened his father with various means such as running away and seeking death, hoping to dissolve the marriage with the Yao family. The girl's father also dealt with it generously, so both parties agreed to cancel the engagement. Unexpectedly, when Wenxian heard about it, she was so grieved that she almost fainted and eventually became ill as a result. She passed away the month before last, leaving her sorrow in the afterlife. A reporter from the Dagong News went to the Yao residence yesterday to investigate the cause of the incident. Old Yao first said, "My eldest daughter, Wenxian, had a bright mind since childhood and had different insights than ordinary people. She entered Yang Jie Girls' School at the age of seven. At the age of twelve, I agreed to the marriage with the Cao family at the request of my colleague Cao Chengbing. My daughter, Wenxian, knew that Cao's son was naturally romantic and objected after learning about it. However, the matter was already decided and it was useless to regret it. From then on, she was always depressed and unwilling to pursue further studies. Until the spring of last year, she learned that the Cao family had proposed to cancel the engagement, and she was extremely shocked. I received a letter from my daughter and returned home. I saw my daughter crying uncontrollably and had not eaten for two days. I questioned Cao about the reasons for the cancellation, and he said it was due to a father-son conflict. My daughter suffered a major stimulus from this and wanted to die. In casual conversations, she often expressed her complaints. At that time, I thought it was just my daughter's temporary anger and comforted her because she had made some heartbreaking remarks. However, my daughter was virtuous and chaste and transcended the world with sorrow. She often said, 'What distinguishes humans from animals is a sense of shame. Now they are relying on their power to abandon me at will and seek me as they please. The human rights of women have been completely deprived. I am ashamed to live in this vile world.' Alas, from listening to her words and observing her integrity, one can know what kind of person she was. From then on, tears often appeared on her face in the morning and evening. I did not know that her determination to die was even more resolute. As a result, her spirit became weaker day by day. Until the 27th day of the third lunar month, she could not support herself and fell ill in bed. I asked Dr. Li Lanping to diagnose her, and he said that it was caused by heartbreak and that her condition was deep. He told me to be careful between Dashu and Xiaoshu. I was greatly shocked when I heard this. How could a casual illness lead to this? I then asked students such as Qiao Bingru to examine her, and they all made the same diagnosis. Seeing that it was difficult to save her, I asked her if she had any regrets. She replied that she had lived in vain and had not repaid her parents, and that she was guilty. She said that even though her body would die, her heart would not. At the time, her tears welled up in her eyes. Although she did not say it clearly, I could already know where her heartbreak was. My daughter Wenxian was naturally gentle and quiet. When spoken to, she was hesitant, but she was simple on the outside and bright on the inside, and her mind was extremely clever. She could learn any needlework skill at a glance. Whenever there was a happy event, she would only smile, but in times of difficulty, she would do her best to resolve it. As for treating people and dealing with matters, she never used harsh words or angry expressions. She cared for her younger siblings with meticulous care. Moreover, she had a broad face and a full chin, and her nose was tall and straight. She did not look like she would die young. Unfortunately, she passed away on the 26th day of the fifth lunar month. Alas, my daughter's way of dealing with the world was something that I could not match. If there had not been this change, she would surely have been a virtuous wife and a good mother. If she had changed her hair and put on a hat, her vision and actions would surely have served the village. Now, unfortunately, she has suffered this strange change. Is it heaven's jealousy? Or is it people's envy? Or is it that I am not blessed enough to have this daughter? Alas, my daughter's untimely death was undeniably due to the Cao family. But I was blind and did not follow my daughter's rejection of the marriage in the beginning, nor could I save her later, causing her to be buried with sorrow. I am guilty of killing my daughter and it is difficult to deny it. I am ashamed of my lack of education and cannot recount her life. I have written a eulogy to express my grief." After Old Yao finished speaking, he showed the reporter the eulogy, which read, "How lofty was your ambition, grieving over the vile world, silently upholding the old morality, with little foresight, causing your daughter to be buried in sorrow, who is to blame?" and "Your heart was too firm, sadly touching the past, not following the new era, determined to die early, regretting that I did not know, and the responsibility lies with me."</p>
<p>Departure from Shanghai The head of the group, Chen Zhenglong, and members Ding Renjie, Huang Biyuan, Fan Zhongkang, Li Yiran, Wang Haiqing, and others took the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo third and fourth-class slow train to Songjiang at 9:35 yesterday morning. Before the departure, friends of each person went to the station to see them off. With the sound of the whistle, they shook hands with those who were saying goodbye, boarded the train, waved their handkerchiefs and flags, and the rumbling train sped towards the southwest.</p>
<p>Head's Speech A reporter from the New Sound News interviewed the head of the group, Chen Zhenglong, on the train yesterday morning. According to him, the group received sympathy and goodwill from all walks of life during this visit to Shanghai, but it was a pity that they could not promote it as much as possible, which was a pity. He especially felt resentment towards Xiaoshijie for tearing up the propaganda. As for the group's current plan to first go to Songjiang for about two days, and then walk to Fengjing, Jiaxing, Xiaoshi, and other stations for propaganda before going to Hangzhou, some people believe that urban compatriots are deeply aware of the national crisis and that propaganda should start in remote rural areas. Therefore, some people want us to go to the northwest first. However, because education is not yet widespread in our country, farmer and worker compatriots may not be able to deeply understand the current national crisis. Therefore, the group intends to earnestly publicize to the laborers in order to promote the entire country, both up and down, to understand the way to save the country. This is the only purpose of the group's colleagues, and no matter how much difficulty and sacrifice there is, we will not hesitate.</p>
<p>Mayor's Gift of Clothes The mayor of this city, Wu Tiecheng, believed that the clothes of the group members were uneven and unsightly, so he specially made eleven sets of blue and yellow full military uniforms to be distributed to all the soldiers in the group. Sanyou Industrial Society and Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory also each donated towels. The Sino-Western Pharmacy donated anti-epidemic water. The Buddhist Layman Forest printed and donated "Letters to Compatriots" and declarations. Huang Jingwan donated a stack of paper.</p>
<h3>Gang Rape and Murder Case Concluded</h3>
<p>The Result of a Love Triangle</p>
<p>Lu Wangshi Detained Pending Sentencing</p>
<p>Qiang Fugen, from Wuxi, was stabbed to death by Zhang Hanzhang with a knife near Zhaofeng Park due to a love triangle. Zhang fled immediately after the incident, and only Lu Wangshi, the main character in the case, was arrested and brought to the prosecutor's office of the court. After a clear investigation by Prosecutor Lei Binzhang, she was prosecuted for premeditated murder. Judge Guan Liting held a court hearing that was not concluded, pending Ran Chuanzheng's testimony. Reports have been previously recorded. It is now known that this case was continued in the Fifth Court by Judge Guan yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. After the judge ascended the bench, he ordered Lu Wangshi, who was in custody, to be brought to the case. According to the testimony, Zhang Hanzhang's murder of Qiang Fugen was not known to me in advance. The witness Zhou Wenbo testified that he was 27 years old, from Kunshan, and lived on West Street in Penglai Town, Kunshan, where he ran a cigarette paper and grocery store. When I was an accountant at Taipingqiao Sauce Garden in the past, I had business dealings with Lu Yizhang, the husband of Lu Wangshi.</p>
<p>Therefore, I knew Lu Wangshi. Question: Did Lu Wangshi come to your house on May 21 this year? Answer: Because I suffered from hemoptysis, I moved back to West Street in Penglai Town, Kunshan in September last year. Question: How much money do you owe Qiang Fugen? Answer: I don't owe Qiang anything. I only owe the Lu family 50 yuan. Besides, I paid 10 yuan in interest in April this year. At this point, the official said to Lu Wangshi, "You once testified that Zhou Wenbo owed Qiang Fugen 500 yuan. You went to Zhou's house on May 21. Just now Zhou Wenbo said that he does not owe Qiang Fugen any money, and his family has already moved." Lu Wangshi was speechless. The official said, "You are completely lying." He then ordered the witness Jiang Zongde to testify. Jiang Zongde is from Shanghai and lives at No. 2 Chongdefang, Xiaobeimen, doing a grain business. Question: What is your relationship with Lu Wangshi? Answer: I am a friend with Lu Yizhang, so I know Lu Wangshi. Question:</p>
<p>Premeditated Murder</p>
<p>Do you know? Answer: I don't know. I only know that at 3:00 PM on the day of the incident, a phone call came from Caojiadu, which was entrusted to convey the message to the Lu family across the street. However, I don't know who made the phone call from Caojiadu. At that time, Lu Wangshi happened to be chatting at my house. I immediately called Lu Wangshi to answer the phone. I don't know what was said on the phone. After about an hour, Lu Wangshi came to make a phone call for about several tens of minutes. The conversation was not finished yet. Because I had something to do at the store and needed to make a phone call, I stepped forward to urge her. At this time, I heard Lu Wangshi say to the other party, "I don't have time now, I can only come at night." After saying this, Lu Wangshi hung up the</p>
<p>Receiver</p>
<p>And went home. According to the testimony of the witness Wang Yeshi, she is 43 years old, from Huzhou, and lives at No. 28, Lane 2, Shizi Lane. Question: What is your relationship with Lu Yushi? Answer: We are cousins. The official said, "Since you are close relatives, your testimony is not credible." The official ordered her to step down. He then summoned Qiang Fengshi to testify. Qiang Fengshi is from Wuxi and lives at No. 2 Huajin Lane, Sanmalu, doing a catering business. On the day of the incident, a phone call came from the Sixth District Police Station, saying that my nephew Fugen was killed in the Xiaoshiqiao area and was now being treated at the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. I was shocked when I heard the news and immediately took a car to the hospital to meet Fugen. According to him, Lu Wangshi lured me to Zhaofeng Garden to play. When we reached the Xiaoshiqiao area, Zhang Hanzhang, who had been lying in ambush, rushed out with a knife and stabbed me violently. Because Lu Wangshi held my hand, I suffered harm. I am afraid that my life will not be saved. If anything unexpected happens, I ask my</p>
<p>Aunt to seek redress</p>
<p>I was very sad when I heard this. Not long after, my nephew died due to his injuries. I asked for redress. Finally, according to the testimony of Qiang Shenshi, the mother of the deceased, my family relied entirely on Fugen to support us. Now he has been murdered by Lu Wangshi, Zhang Hanzhang, and others. Who will we rely on in the future? I ask the court to seek redress for my son and to pursue private prosecution for living expenses. At this point, the judge asked Prosecutor Lei Binzhang to attend the court to give his opinion, which was roughly: "Whether the defendant Lu Wangshi is having an affair with Qiang Fugen and Zhang Hanzhang is not known. However, before Qiang Fugen died, he had an affair with Lu Wangshi, and later he had an affair with Zhang Hanzhang. Although Lu Wangshi firmly denies it, it can be understood by observing Lu Wangshi's actions. It can be seen that what Qiang Fugen said is true. According to Lu Wangshi, Zhang Hanzhang lent Qiang Fugen 500 yuan, but Qiang</p>
<p>Was unable to repay</p>
<p>And Lu Wangshi went to Zhou Wenjian's house to ask for money. This is clearly all lies. And when the incident happened in the Xiaoshiqiao area, Lu Wangshi held Qiang Fugen's hand, and Zhang Hanzhang stabbed him violently with a knife. This proves the premeditation. The facts are extremely clear. Moreover, Lu Wangshi and Qiang Fugen went out to play together. Since Qiang Fugen was attacked, why didn't Lu Wangshi call for help, and why didn't she report to the police station? After the incident, she avoided going home. Lu Wangshi is indeed guilty of premeditated murder,</p>
<p>Without a doubt</p>
<p>I ask for a public trial." Then the debate began. The two lawyers hired by the defendant, Pan Renxi and Yao Junyu, stood up one after another to defend her. Then lawyer Mao Fengwu acted as the agent. The plaintiff requested to pursue compensation for private prosecution, because Qiang Fugen could earn 160 yuan per month during his lifetime, which is calculated for two years, plus the cost of clothing and coffin, which is more than 300 yuan. A total of 4,300 yuan is requested. The judge asked Lu Wangshi again if she had any final statements. She replied, "If I had irregular behavior outside, would my husband be willing to hire a lawyer to defend me?" The judge considered the conclusion and scheduled the sentence for 9:00 AM on the 13th of this month. Lu Wangshi was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Cao Chunsheng Commits Suicide Due to Economic Pressure</h3>
<p>Cao Chunsheng, from Qingjiang, is 36 years old and lives upstairs in a chicken and duck shop at the entrance of Caishi Street in the French Concession. He used to be a waiter but is now unemployed. Due to economic pressure, he had the idea of ending his life. At about 0:30 AM yesterday, he secretly swallowed raw opium and committed suicide. He was later discovered by his family, who rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at 6:00 PM. The hospital reported it to the French patrol police station, which ordered detectives to investigate and transferred the body to Tongren Fuyuantang to await examination.</p>

<h3>Reactions to Disguised Price Increase for Water and Electricity</h3>
<p>City Federation Fourth Branch Held Emergency Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation in the Nanyang Bridge area of the French Concession, in order to oppose the French Business Water and Electricity Company's increase in water and electricity deposit fees, convened an emergency meeting at the Yanxin Temple meeting hall at 8 pm yesterday. More than ten committee members attended, including Xu Yanwu, Huang Zhixian, Dong Wenli, He Yaozhang, Dong Kechang, Tong Lizhang, Sun Ruiting, and Cen Zhiliang. Ye Ruizhai was publicly elected as chairman, and Yu Jingqing recorded and reported the purpose of the meeting and letters from various parties. The following matters were discussed: (1) This Federation has repeatedly received reports from citizens stating that the French Business Water and Electricity Company, at a time when the market is bleak and all industries are sluggish, has secretly requested the French Municipal Council to amend its articles of association and increase the substantial water and electricity deposit fees, which is tantamount to a disguised price increase that is difficult to bear. They requested that reasoned negotiations be conducted to oppose this measure. After detailed discussion by the committee members, the following countermeasures were decided upon: (A) Send a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting that the Chinese directors propose to the French Municipal Council to prevent the company from amending its articles of association in order to avoid disguised price increases. (B) Send a letter to the General Association requesting a convocation of a city-wide citizens' assembly to discuss resolute countermeasures. (C) Notify all members to pay attention to all actions of the Water and Electricity Company, and to immediately report any suspicious documents to this Federation for reasoned negotiation. (D) Issue a declaration detailing that water and electricity are public utilities, and that the company already earns more than one million in profits annually, yet it is still greedy and insatiable in its attempts to raise prices. Under the current economic downturn, this is particularly inappropriate and should be brought to the attention of all sectors. (E) Investigate the recent overproduction, falling prices, rent, water, and electricity, all of which are necessities of daily life for citizens, and should be reduced as soon as possible to help the situation. (2) Discussed and passed a resolution to send a telegram expressing condolences upon the death of German President Hindenburg. (3) Discussed and approved the filing of a report from the Min Tian Fang branch on rent reduction. (4) Discussed and approved the appointment of Mr. Huang Yuzhai as an honorary member of the Federation's Public Welfare Committee. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

<p>International Jockey Club</p>
<h3>Horses and Jockeys Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The International Jockey Club, which caused a sensation throughout Shanghai with its recruitment of female employees, is one of the newest ventures in Shanghai today. The club is located at the original site of the China Jockey Club in Yinxiang Port.

One hundred and fifty racehorses, jockeys, and trainers were hired from Australia via telegram from Shanghai and arrived in port yesterday aboard the Sydney Maru. The Sydney Maru's route does not usually pass through Shanghai, so this special shipment demonstrates the importance placed on the event. The racing rules will be based on the current rules in Australia and South America. According to general opinion, the Western Australian Turf Club rules will be the standard, as these rules have long been recognized as one of the most standard. It is anticipated that the opening day will be a grand occasion.</p>

<p>Wang Xiufeng, age 28, from Yangzhou, the owner of the Wang Shunxing referral shop at No. 273 Zhoushan Road, Tangshan Road intersection in East Shanghai, went to the Ling Fuxing shop, owned by a fellow tradesman, the day before yesterday for a game of mahjong. As a result, he lost three yuan. As he was leaving, he suddenly had a quarrel with a gambler, which was resolved by the shop owner. Yesterday at noon, Wang was still sound asleep in his room when three men broke in. They went straight to his room and said to Wang, "What about yesterday's matter?" One of them immediately slapped him in the face. Before he could say anything, they all took out sharp axes and repeatedly hacked at his body, inflicting a total of thirteen wounds: three axe wounds on the left arm, three on the right arm, two on the left leg, one each on the face, back, and head, and two on the back of the arm. The perpetrators, seeing that their objective had been achieved, then left triumphantly.

<h3>Bloodshed in Flower Gambling Gang Fight</h3>
<p>The scourge of flower gambling is immense. Since the authorities in both the Chinese and French Concessions of this city have strictly investigated and prohibited it, the gambling style of flower clubs has disappeared. Unexpectedly, Turtle A Zhong, Shao Changsheng, Hong Miaosheng, Shen Jiafu, Jin Heshang, and others, who have been wanted for a long time, have recently been actively operating again. They have established large-scale flower gambling dens in the remote and desolate outskirts of the Southern City, in areas neglected by the police, such as Mei Xue Road and Cao Xie Wan. As a result, a bloody gang fight occurred there the day before yesterday, and three people were hacked with axes on the spot. After being sent to the hospital for treatment, it is now learned that the condition of Wang Liangfu has suddenly worsened, and his life is in danger. The Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been ordered to strictly arrest the above-mentioned criminals and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Runs Over Apprentice</h3>
<p>Liu Ansheng, a 21-year-old apprentice at the English and American Pharmacy from Changzhou, borrowed a bicycle from the Yuanfeng Hardware Store next door after the pharmacy closed at approximately 10:10 pm last night. He was practicing in the area around Wuma Road and Qipan Street. When the bicycle had just emerged from Jinlong Street, a No. 5 public bus was approaching head-on. At that moment, Liu was unable to brake the bicycle in time, resulting in a major accident. Liu was knocked to the ground by the public bus, and his head and waist were crushed, resulting in immediate death. The bicycle was also severely damaged. Chinese Constable No. 904 from the Fourth Road General Patrol Room investigated, recorded the number of the public bus involved in the accident and the driver's name, and reported to the chief for handling. The body was sent to Renji Hospital by ambulance and then to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Boatman Falls Into River and Drowns After Hat Falls Off</h3>
<p>Sun Atong's Body Found</p>
<p>Sun Atong, age 24, a native of Sanlintang Township in Pudong, worked as a boatman and was also a good swimmer. The barge he was piloting was moored on the South Huangpu Bund the previous morning. An hour before the incident, a large snake was discovered near the boat, lingering and refusing to leave. Sun was initially suspicious. At noon, when the boat set sail, Sun was working when a sudden gust of wind blew his straw hat into the Huangpu River. At the time, Atong was standing by the side of the boat, intending to retrieve the lost hat. Unexpectedly, he lost his footing and fell into the river. His colleagues saw this and stopped the boat to try to rescue him. However, after Sun fell into the river, he never resurfaced. His colleagues initially suspected that since Sun was a good swimmer, he must have made it ashore on his own. Three days passed. Yesterday, a body was discovered in the Rihui Port. Sun's brother rushed to identify it and confirmed that it was his brother's body. He immediately brought it ashore. A coffin was prepared yesterday for the burial.</p>

<h3>My Country's Tuberculosis Hospital in Beiping</h3>
<p>The Beiping Zhonghua Hospital is jointly established by Chinese tuberculosis experts Lu Yongchun and Deng Xianxiang. It uses the latest scientific methods in the world to treat lung diseases, bringing the dead back to life, with remarkable results. For example, the "artificial pneumothorax treatment method," which is popular in Europe and the United States, has long been used by the hospital with lasting effects. The X-ray department uses the most reliable "stereoscopic imaging method," revealing the lungs completely and without omission. The perfection of the equipment and the rigor of the organization make it a unique, scientific tuberculosis prevention institution in my country. In addition to the Zhonghua Hospital's main branch on Xi'anmennei Dajie in Beiping, it has also selected a location in the southern part of Juwei Mountain at the Badachu in the Western Hills to construct a natural sanatorium for patients with milder conditions who are suitable for mountain sanatoriums. Furthermore, it has established a civilian natural sanatorium at Fushouling in the Western Hills, charging low fees to benefit the poor. The former residence of Li Guo in Gan Shiqiaoqian, Xicheng, Beiping, has been opened as a branch of the Zhonghua Hospital, with wards specifically for lung disease patients to recuperate. The scale of the hospital is evident. At the same time, to raise awareness of tuberculosis prevention among the people of Tianjin and Beiping, it holds tuberculosis prevention lectures, screens tuberculosis prevention films compiled by the American Tuberculosis Association, and publishes tuberculosis books such as "Tuberculosis Theory," "Complete Recovery Diary," and "Blood Treatment," using written propaganda to supplement the inadequacy of diagnosis and treatment. These concurrent efforts are commendable and truly a blessing for lung disease patients in our country.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I am writing on behalf of Mr. Jiang Guopei, who claims that in today's (August 6) issue, your newspaper published a news item about Dongwu Hospital stating that Guopei colluded with Chen Zhenya, the escaped director of the hospital, to defraud money, which is inconsistent with the facts. Mr. Guopei is also a victim of the fraud and is currently trying to investigate. He has specially hired your lawyer to send a letter of explanation to avoid confusing the public. I am writing to inform you accordingly, hoping that you will publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column as a correction. Sincerely, Lu Shidao, Lawyer, August 7. Dear Editor, We were very surprised to read a news item about the "Shanghai Yayue Society Annual Meeting" in the "City News" section of your newspaper on yesterday (August 5). After investigation, this news item is completely untrue, so we are writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Yayue Society, August 6.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Continued "Errors and Difficulties in Translations"</h3>
<p>| Answer to Mr. Du Luoji |</p>
<p>In the previous "Errors and Difficulties in Translations," we explained several errors and difficult problems in Li Da's translation of the two books of "The Course of Materialism." This is our new attempt, and we believe that it will be of great help to readers' reading. In recent years, there have been many translated books in China, but they are often unreliable. For example, in Wen Shengguang's translation of Sugiyama Sakae's "Eleven Lectures on Social Science," many extremely simple parts of the original text were translated by the translator into something inexplicable. Readers often take the incomprehensible sentences above to ask us, and there is no way to answer. We can only simply ask readers not to read such translations to avoid wasting effort. As for Li Da's textbook, because the original book is also very valuable, and the translation is generally very good except for a few errors, we have specially published the difficulties that we have found based on readers' letters and strive to make the book a perfect translation. We hope that readers can raise more questions in the future so that we can have more discoveries. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>How to Achieve "Universality" in Popular Language?</h3>
<p>— Chen Wangdao</p>
<p>| Three Approaches Simultaneously | Chen Wangdao</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui, in a letter titled "Long Live Popular Language," specifically mentioned me, and then repeatedly shouted the two slogans "Long Live Popular Language" and "Literature is Not Dead, Great Disaster Will Not Stop," meaning nothing more than to cut off my previously proposed "Popular Language Literature" at the waist, expressing his upward adoption and downward abandonment. His reason for abandoning literature is actually a kind of heartbreak, deliberately saying it a little too much, and I understand it very well. I remember that he once said in the editor's words of "Hang Yu" on April 20, 1924: "We old monsters saw and knew the cession of land in Jiawu and the entry of the Allied Forces into Beijing in Gengzi, so when we thought of it, we broke off our poetic thoughts." The true meaning is just to tell people not to ignore science and engineering, and not to despise material civilization. There is a lot of Mr. Wu's own words that can prove this (for example, he said in a lecture draft titled "Science and Life" that "these three (literature, philosophy, science) are mutually cyclical and all necessary, but now young people are too biased towards literature and philosophy"). Let's not talk about this for now. Let's just talk about the popular language that Mr. Wu shouted "Long Live" for. Regarding popular language, Mr. Wu specifically proposed the characteristic of "universality." He said: "Classical Chinese, vernacular Chinese, and popular language have differences in how easily they can become universal. Of course, vernacular Chinese is easier to become universal than classical Chinese, and popular language must be even easier to become universal than vernacular Chinese." Saying this in reverse means "Vernacular Chinese is more specialized than popular language, and classical Chinese is more specialized than vernacular Chinese." From the specialized to the universal, how should we proceed! Mr. Wu has already pointed out a path, which is to go from the language of scholars (specialized) to a unified language (universal). He said: "You have your masses, and we have our masses. Your masses combine your language, and our masses combine our language (this is the first step). Your masses and our masses have a unified language, and then they combine with each other. A unified language is still created by the masses, which is the second step." This path can be called "sending up from below." It is necessary to take this path when eliminating classical Chinese and raising mass culture. I know that Mr. Wu Zhihui and Mr. Tao Xingzhi have a lot of experience in this method, and they will definitely tell us about it in detail in the future. In general, the methods they have both said are almost every word is actually honed out, which can be used as our reference. However, this path is not directly related to classical Chinese. From the current situation, it is not easy to achieve much practical effect without others coming to meet it. Now we do not have the power to compile newspapers and books separately for your masses, our masses, their masses, and all other masses. Those masses who learn the first step of the unified language of popular language will only use it for communication and accounting. They do not have much to communicate or much to account for, which will definitely not arouse their strong interest. Even if they learn it, they will return it to the teacher here because they do not use it often. Reporters, writers, scholars, and entrepreneurs are needed to liberate themselves from "specialized" things such as classical Chinese and "meet down from above." It also requires linguists and popular educators to write more books that are relatively universal and readable, investigate more common words and grammar in various places, open more language schools to train language teachers, and compile more common vocabulary, "passing through horizontally." With these three approaches simultaneously, it will be easier to complete that "universal" popular language. The roadmap for establishing popular language, as I see it, is roughly as follows. I don't know what everyone thinks. If this diagram is correct, then everyone needs to work hard and move towards a common center "universality" from their own foothold.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Reading</h3>
<p>— Yan Yu</p>
<p>Gorky was very amazed by the skill of Balzac's novels in writing dialogue, believing that without describing the appearance of the characters, he could make the reader feel as if he had seen the people speaking after reading the dialogue. (Inside "My Literary Cultivation" in the August issue of "Literature")</p>
<p>China does not yet have such good novelists, but in some places in "Water Margin" and "Dream of the Red Chamber," readers can see the people through their words. In fact, this is not a strange thing. People who rent a small house in the Shanghai alley can often experience it. He and the surrounding residents may not have met, but they are only separated by a thin partition wall, so the conversations of the family members and guests of some people, especially the loud conversations, can be heard roughly. Over time, you know who those people are and you seem to feel what kind of people they are.</p>
<p>If we delete the unnecessary points and only extract the characteristic conversations of each person, I think, we can enable others to infer each speaking character from the conversations. But I am not saying; this will become the Chinese Balzac. When the author uses dialogue to express characters, I am afraid that there is an appearance of pursuing the characters in his own mind, so he transmits it to the reader, so that the appearance of this character is also formed in the reader's mind. However, the character inferred by the reader is not necessarily the same as what the author imagined. Balzac's thin old man with a small mustache may have become a rough and strong bearded man in Gorky's head, but the personality, words, and actions must be somewhat similar, roughly the same, just like translating French into Russian, otherwise, the thing called literature will have no universality.</p>
<p>Although literature has universality, it changes due to the different experiences of the reader. If the reader does not have similar experiences, it will lose its effectiveness. For example, when we read "Dream of the Red Chamber" and infer Lin Daiyu from the words, we must exclude the preconceived notions of Dr. Mei's "Daiyu Burying Flowers" photo and think of another one. Then, I am afraid we will think of a modern girl with short hair, wearing an Indian silk shirt, thin, and lonely; or some other appearance, I cannot determine. But try comparing it with the portraits in "Dream of the Red Chamber Illustrated" and other similar things published thirty or forty years ago, it must be completely different. What is painted on it is Lin Daiyu in the minds of the readers at that time.</p>
<p>Literature has universality, but it has boundaries; there are also more permanent ones, but they change due to the social experiences of the reader. I believe that the Eskimos of the Arctic and the blacks in the hinterland of Africa will not understand "Lin Daiyu type"; and people in a healthy and rational good society will also not be able to understand it. They are probably more alienated than our hearing about Emperor Qin's burning of books and Huang Chao's killing of people. Once there is a change, it is not permanent. To say that literature has a unique immortal body is the dream talk of dreamers.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Zibo (Continued from June 28th)</h3>
<p>— Luo Wang</p>
<p>(5) To Whom Does the Golden Land Belong?</p>
<p>Leaving Zichuan and taking the Zhang (Dian) Bo (Shan) branch road, we arrived in Boshan.</p>
<p>Exiting the station, we saw coal storage yards. Coal carts were everywhere, filled with shiny, crystalline coal. In Boshan, the ground is mostly black soil. Public servants dare not wear white uniform trousers in the summer, but instead wear riding breeches, because of the coal dust and dirt flying in the streets, which would quickly turn white clothes black!</p>
<p>Boshan is a special county in Shandong, and indeed in China. It is an industrial and commercial area of coal and minerals. The land is full of undulating hills and crisscrossing streams, and coal mines are scattered throughout the countryside, ready to be exploited! Therefore, most people make a living by mining, and some even get rich. Boshan does not produce enough food, and must rely on the supply of rice and grain from elsewhere.</p>
<p>The abundance of underground minerals in Boshan is difficult to describe. In addition to the most famous coal mines, there are also porcelain clay, sand, glass raw materials, red lead, alum, black alum, red earth, iron, lead, copper, lime, mica, gemstones, antimony, etc. Special products include coal (dozens of varieties), glass, colored glaze, Zishi inkstones, porcelain, kiln products, and wooden crafts! Therefore, the people of Boshan do not need to farm the land; as long as they know how to find it, it can be said that gold is everywhere! But today in China! We are mired in unimproved small-scale handicrafts, rural areas are bankrupt, the social economy is in panic, and coupled with the intensified oppression and exploitation by capitalist imperialists, Boshan, despite its abundant wealth, has no power for its people except to become bankrupt workers, to resist the machine power of the imperialists! This is truly a pity!</p>
<p>Although Boshan has many coal mines, and many small-capital coal pits as well, the purely manual excavation and transportation cannot compete with the astonishing output of the industrialized Bodong Company.</p>
<p>Speaking of Bodong Company, like the Ludai Company of Zichuan, it appears to be a Sino-Japanese joint venture, but in reality it has become a lifeline for the Japanese Navy! The anthracite produced there is said to be exclusively for use on warships! Therefore, the Japanese government investigates the situation in Zibo more thoroughly than we Chinese! They understand the social conditions better than we do! Just look at the Rising Sun flag waving near the Japanese concession near the station, and it is not difficult to imagine these two sentences: "Tell me, in today's world, whose domain is it?"!</p>
<p>Let me give you an example! When the Jinan May 3rd Massacre occurred in 1928, the Japanese drove all the county magistrates along the Jiaoji Railway twenty miles away. The magistrate of Boshan County had to move to Yuanquanzhuang, twenty miles away, until the Jinan case was resolved before he could move back! From this incident, does China still have administrative power within its own territory? Recalling the past, looking at the present, and thinking about the future, I really don't know to whom the golden land belongs!</p>
<h3>Happiness and I Have No Good Fate</h3>
<p>— Pu Feng</p>
<p>丨丨 Shanghai Voices, Part Two 丨丨</p>
<p>I never planned how to enjoy myself, but when a few friends insisted on dragging me into a large dance hall to take a look, I couldn't refuse.</p>
<p>Jazz, foxtrots... of course, this isn't anything new. Precisely because it's not new, I know my place. Right now, could I possibly find within myself the fortune to enjoy myself like they do?</p>
<p>"Dance! Why not give it a try?" My friends were busy urging others to take the plunge.</p>
<p>Following a burst of red and blue lights, people were very busy, as if fatigue would never climb onto their brows. But, heaven, why does my heart churn, unable to muster even a hint of interest? The red and blue lights brought me fatigue and drowsiness. Drowsiness seemed like a magician with the power to tempt, and it easily seduced me. 丨丨 Suddenly, I thought: Why am I here, alive, suffering?</p>
<p>So, I resolutely stood up, told a lie, and bid farewell to my friends. My friends' attempts to keep me were in vain. On the street, I heard my own footsteps again. With each steady step, my heart composed this voice:</p>
<p>I alone support my stumbling fate,</p>
<p>Unafraid of wind and rain, adrift in the waves.</p>
<p>Passing through dark and gloomy alleys,</p>
<p>I pursue the illumination of light.</p>
<p>Happiness and I have no good fate,</p>
<p>Give me layers of tribulation,</p>
<p>I am willing to go in and out of a hail of bullets,</p>
<p>I am willing to rock in dangerous and terrifying waves.</p>
<p>Back home, I finally breathed a sigh of relief. Picking up my diary, I began to write. I, I will not forget to write these sentences: "Happiness and I have no good fate. This may just be the first 'escape'!"</p>
<h3>I Come From the East (17)</h3>
<p>— Xing Ye</p>
<p>As we went around Tokyo, my friends told me about the various forms of enslaved life in Tokyo: prostitutes, workers, especially female workers. At the entrances of brothels, there were photos of the prostitutes, with price lists below. It is said that the owners of these brothels are all millionaires. The coffee shops, the larger ones, were completely decorated in European and American style. At one we went to, there was even an inscription by Zheng Xiaoxu. Below Zheng Xiaoxu's inscription was a large wireless radio, which, as you ate your ice cream, warned of the impending war.</p>
<p>Tokyo gave me two impressions: first, busyness; second, seriousness. The busyness had a touch of frenzy; the seriousness had a touch of anxiety. In the waiting room at Tokyo Station, you could see hundreds and thousands of men and women, reading newspapers incessantly. This phenomenon does not exist in China, nor does it exist in the United States. Wearing silver-rimmed glasses, sporting a small mustache above the lip, and wearing the uniquely Japanese expression of suffering, they hurried back and forth in the station. These Japanese people, influenced by the propaganda of the ruling class, and anesthetized by the government and warlords, truly believed that Japan had only two paths: dominating the world or being defeated and destroyed as a nation. On the train, on the street, what you saw were faces of suffering, faces of pity, faces of self-righteousness, faces of coldness tinged with fear. They did not laugh much. Their mouths were always pursed, firmly pursed and unmoving. On the train, everyone read the newspapers, and what they read was all about airplanes, cannons, diplomacy, the military, honor, and humiliation. Japan was originally just a small tin firecracker. The Japanese government and ruling class are heating the gunpowder inside every day. The small firecracker is going to explode, and when it explodes, it will make a great noise. The people of Tokyo, with their worried faces, are every day fearing or hoping for the arrival of this great explosion, or on the day of the bombing, those who hoped will turn to fear, and those who feared may turn to hope. However, the problem is indeed serious. They also truly know that in the face of a serious situation, they must be busy like madmen. Busyness, how important a characteristic. The United States has it, the Japanese have it, and Germans, Italians, and Russians, have they not also had periods of seriousness? Only we Chinese, with broken hands and severed arms, are still living in a drunken dream, greedily indulging in anesthesia, unaware that the sword has already pierced our hearts, and when the sword is pulled out, we will not know where so much blood came from!</p>
<h3>Long time no see, Shanghai!</h3>
<p>The sea gradually turned yellow, the mountain yellow turned into a muddy yellow, the mouth of the Yangtze River was near. The water was particularly turbid, the waves stirred by the ship carrying mud, looked very heavy, is the Chinese territory. Three years ago left the country, although at that time there were unstable rumors in the northeast, did not expect that in my feet on foreign land ten days later, then crackled like a local news of national subjugation, my eyes are the motherland, the motherland is not the state three years ago. There was a student from Jilin Province on board, and I didn't know how uncomfortable he would be in his heart.</p>

<h3>Yang Xiuqiong's Family Returns South This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Slightly Unwell Due to Overly Busy Social Engagements</p>
<p>States Aspirations, Hoping to Attend the World Games</p>
<p>Too Young to Discuss Marriage</p>
<p>The mermaid Yang Xiuqiong, at the invitation of the Jiangxi New Life Movement Association last month, participated in the opening ceremony of the association. After the event, she set off to return to Hong Kong and passed through Shanghai on the 3rd. At the request of sports and swimming organizations in the city, she stayed in Shanghai for several days, performing swimming techniques at the Junpu Bureau Staff Sports Association, the YMCA, and the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach. She was also warmly entertained by various organizations. Yesterday (the 7th), Yang's father, Zhu Nan, hosted a tea party for various circles at the Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road. Afterwards, he visited the Liangjiang Women's Sports Academy. He also visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government to say goodbye. A record of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>States Aspirations: The lady met with reporters at her lodging this morning to discuss her experiences and thoughts on learning to swim. The lady first said, "My swimming skills are the result of my father's home education. I have been practicing since I was twelve years old, which is only four years so far, so my technique is still very immature. In the summer of the year after I started learning, I presumptuously participated in the Hong Kong Harbour Crossing Race and was fortunate enough to win the championship. Mr. Smith, a world-renowned swimming champion, passed through Hong Kong last year and watched me practice. He praised me for having swimming talent and told my father to train me often, saying that I have a lot of hope in the future and may be able to match the world's swimming champions." The lady then said, regarding the Australian Sports Association's invitation for me to participate in its Victoria Games, whether or not I will accept the invitation will be decided after I return to Hong Kong. When the reporter asked about her marriage, the lady was very generous and frankly replied, "I am still young and am in a period of study, so I cannot talk about this at the moment." Afterwards, the lady also said, "When I am in Hong Kong, I practice swimming almost every day, for about one or two hours each time. From now on, I will work even harder to achieve my ideal goals." Finally, the reporter asked whether the lady would represent our country in the swimming competition when the World Games are held next year. She replied, "This is not a question of whether I will participate personally, but rather a decision by the government. If the government sends me to participate, I will certainly not decline."</p>
<p>Yang's Father Hosts: At 2:00 PM yesterday, Yang's father, Zhu Nan, hosted a tea party for various circles. Representatives from the Shanghai YMCA, the Guangdong Fellow Association, the Chinese Swimming Research Association, the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach, the Lianhua Woolen Factory, and other organizations, as well as reporters from various newspapers, totaling more than 70 people, arrived on time. Miss Yang Xiuqiong and her family accompanied the guests. At the beginning of the tea party, Yang's father stood up and thanked the guests, saying, "My daughter, Xiuqiong, was invited by the Jiangxi New Life Movement Association to participate in the opening ceremony held in Nanchang. After the event, she passed through Shanghai on her way back to Hong Kong. We are deeply grateful for the warm welcome and affection from all circles. How can we repay this? As we are in a hurry with our luggage and must return to Hong Kong tomorrow (i.e., today), I dare to trouble you all to come to this tea party today to express our gratitude. However, after returning, I will personally lead my daughter, Xiuqiong, to strive for improvement, so as to live up to your expectations of encouragement today."</p>
<p>Xiuqiong's Speech: After Yang's father finished speaking, Xiuqiong also followed up with a speech, saying, "Xiuqiong passed through Shanghai on her way from Jiangxi back to Hong Kong, and I am grateful for the kindness of all circles in retaining us. I regret that my swimming skills are not perfect, and although I have performed several times, there is nothing to boast about. However, gentlemen from all circles, especially my colleagues in the news media, have encouraged and exhorted me, and I dare not fail to strive forward to meet your expectations. Moreover, as the departure date is imminent, I am afraid that today's reception is not complete, and I cannot bid farewell to everyone one by one. In addition to my apologies, I am deeply grateful."</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests: After Miss Yang finished speaking, Li Dachao, the section chief of the Municipal Government, gave a speech, saying in essence, "Today's China is often seen as the 'sick man of Asia' by foreigners. In fact, the reason why our nation is weak is that we often neglect and fail to pay attention to methods that benefit physical and mental health. Now, Miss Yang Xiuqiong, under the guidance of her father, Mr. Zhu Nan, pays great attention to methods that benefit physical and mental health on a daily basis. Therefore, her victory in the Far East Games as the women's swimming champion of the Chinese team is the result of a healthy lifestyle on a daily basis. If the people of the whole country can turn to sports as Mr. Zhu Nan has done in his family, then the health and strength of the entire nation will not be inevitable." Following Director Li's speech, Guan Jiu'an and Hu Zongfan, representatives from the press, also spoke. During the gathering, the Hua'an Publishing House also distributed special publications on the Far Eastern Games. Guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>
<p>Visit to Liangjiang: After the tea party, Miss Yang and her parents, sisters, and brothers took a car back to Xin Ya. Bi, the Liangjiang Sports Academy in Jiangwan, sent a car to pick them up. Miss Yang then, together with her mother, Yang Longshi, and her younger brother, Changhua, boarded the car and drove straight to Jiangwan. After arriving at Liangjiang, the principal of the school, Lu Lihua, and representatives from the Education Bureau, Shao Rugan, Wang Ruizhu, and Cai Sipu, accompanied them to tea and snacks. Then, at the request of photographers, they took a group photo with the accompanying guests in front of the school's office. Afterwards, Principal Lu led them to visit the auditorium, classrooms, library, track and field, tennis courts, and the swimming pool under construction. At that time, Tianyi Film Company also sent staff to film.</p>
<p>Departure from Shanghai This Afternoon: At 5:30 PM, accompanied by Lu Lihua, the principal of Liangjiang School, they drove to the Municipal Government to visit Mayor Wu. It so happened that Mayor Wu had gone to the memorial service for the late President Hindenburg held at the German Consulate in the city. They did not meet. Yang then personally went to the reception room and left a note written in her own hand, which read, "I came specially to visit, but I am very disappointed that we did not meet. I am returning to Hong Kong tomorrow morning, and I am in a hurry with my luggage, so I cannot say goodbye in person. This to Mayor Wu, Yang Xiuqiong's family, August 7th." They then returned to Xin Ya in the original car, accompanied by Principal Lu. The reporter then asked again about her usual swimming practice time and whether the departure date, i.e., today, was definite. She replied that Xiuqiong's usual practice time is after school every day, from about 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. On Sundays, it is about four hours in the morning and afternoon, the time is uncertain. As for the return date, because it has been a week since we suddenly came to Shanghai, it has been decided that we will leave Shanghai tomorrow (the 8th) afternoon on the Grand President of the Da Lai Company.</p>
<p>Liu's Farewell Dinner: Liu Baichuan, the chief of the preparatory committee of the New Life Club, and his wife, Ms. Han Wenmei, accompanied Miss Yang and her family to Shanghai. Last night at 7:00 PM, Liu held a banquet at the Dongya Restaurant to bid farewell to Miss Yang. More than forty people attended, hosted by Liu Baichuan and his wife and Liu Shangjun. The party ended at about 10:00 PM. The Hanxue Society also distributed one copy each of the Hanxue Monthly and Hanxue Weekly to the guests.</p>
<p>Xianfang Cup Makeup Match</p>
<h3>Green Light Defeats Tongji 11-4</h3>
<p>The Green Light team's performance in this year's Xianfang Cup has been quite good. Currently, they have played six times, scoring 67 points and losing only 23 points. Their strength is definitely not below that of the Yuyou Railway team. The makeup match with Tongji is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Wang Wenzheng (Green) defeated Wang Xudong (Tong) 6-1, 6-1, 6-1</p>

<p>Honolulu Star Zheng Guiguang</p>
<p>vs. YMCA Veteran Sun Daosheng</p>
<p>Zheng Guiguang, a famous overseas Chinese handball player, has just returned to China from the United States.

The first friendly exhibition match will be held at the YMCA handball court on Sichuan Road at 4:30 PM today. The YMCA has invited veteran Sun Daosheng to represent</p>
<h3>Using Evil Forces to Promote Sports and Suppress the Tide</h3>
<p>A Contribution to Miss Yang Xiuqiong and Those Who Welcome Her</p>
<p>China is in a period of transition between the old and the new. Chinese society has not yet escaped the shackles of feudal society. Social knowledge is still so shallow. In such a country and society, to promote a new thing, one will certainly encounter many obstacles and difficulties. Sports in China, at least, is still a new thing, and even more so for women's sports. Obstacles and difficulties are to be expected. The success or failure of our promotion of sports depends entirely on whether we can overcome these obstacles and difficulties.</p>
<p>Propelling force and resistance are inversely proportional. The greater the propelling force, the greater the resistance. In China's semi-feudal society, promoting sports is exactly the same. Therefore, when we propel and promote, we should be so careful and pay attention to how easily we can go astray.</p>
<p>It is quite difficult for those who promote sports, and it is no different for the athletes themselves. As long as you have better results, external forces and social temptations will attract you to the path of complacency and arrogance. The higher you rise, the more violently you will fall. The history of past athletes can cite many examples. Being an athlete in China is really not easy. The lack of progress of Chinese athletes, reaching the top all at once, not progressing, is the reason.</p>
<p>Miss Yang Xiuqiong's swimming talent and achievements are unique in China. It is also a new era for the Chinese sports world in the past twenty years to be able to show its face overseas. Therefore, Miss Yang's welcome and support everywhere is deserved and should be there. We should express our admiration and admiration for her. At the same time, we should cherish and promote Miss Yang's talent.</p>
<p>Recently, Miss Yang was invited by the Nanchang New Life Movement Club to go north to perform, which caused a sensation in Jiangnan and a craze everywhere. Of course, it cannot be said that this is a good phenomenon for promoting sports. However, recently we have seen the situation and actions of welcoming Miss Yang, and we really feel worried and deeply feel that there is a danger of going astray.</p>
<p>We dare not say that the motives of those who welcome her are not to promote sports and to express admiration for Miss Yang personally, nor dare we say that they do not understand the methods and principles of promoting sports. However, the more they love her, the more they harm her. In China's counter-construction society, dealing with Miss Yang, a sixteen-year-old girl, in this way, with her shallow education and weak will, will it have a bad influence and results, and even affect the social perception, and create a complacent and arrogant athlete? Society looks at her in the same way as it looks at Mei Lanfang and Hai Jingbo, as mysterious and strange. The advertising-style welcome is even more unnecessary. In promoting the welcomers, have they thought about the danger of trapping sports in the same way as street performers, the bad phenomenon of drinking a few shouts of appreciation, clapping a few times, and shouting a few good words? It is not welcoming Miss Yang personally, it is simply insulting her.</p>
<p>Welcoming Miss Yang is just an example of promoting sports. If you really love Miss Yang, you should use proper methods to reward her, encourage her, train her, and make her a real Chinese sports talent, a world sports talent, to win glory for China and contribute to the world. Miss Yang herself should also be humble and broad-minded, to reject all boring social events, unconscious welcomes, resist external pressure, and work hard to accelerate progress in her achievements, and truly move forward aggressively. Otherwise, for those who welcome her, loving her is just enough to harm her, and the future harm is unimaginable. For Miss Yang herself, she has reached an end point. It is necessary to vomit out the bones in her throat. I don't know what the readers think.</p>
<p>Daosheng will represent and appear. The two gentlemen had a mixed doubles practice match on the field yesterday, and the performance was extremely wonderful. One is a famous overseas player, and the other is a top player in Shanghai. It is expected that today's exhibition match will be even more amazing in its artistry. Mr. Zheng likes sports and is known as an all-around athlete. Handball is one of his specialties. In recent years, he has won the Honolulu All-City Chinese and Western Singles Second Place and a Doubles Championship once.</p>

<p>Education News: Graduates in Beijing</p>
<h3>Organizing a Professional Sports League</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th) Of the Central University's graduating class of over four hundred students this year, more than three hundred have yet to find employment. On the morning of the 8th, Sun Guangyu and a dozen others initiated a meeting in Lanjiazhuang, resolving to immediately post notices in the dormitories. The resolutions are as follows: 1. Solicit signatures from unemployed graduates to join on the 13th. 2. Approve the draft charter of the Central University Graduates' Professional Sports League. 3. Draft a declaration to be used in the second phase of action, which includes a general membership meeting and a petition to the government.</p>
<h3>Central University Entrance Examination</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th) The entrance examination for new students at Central University began at 7:00 AM on the 7th. The morning session covered Mathematics and Party Principles, while the afternoon session covered Chinese and Foreign History and Geography. The examination concluded at 4:00 PM with orderly conduct.</p>
<h3>Representatives Petitioning in Nanjing for the Second Time on Behalf of the League for Promoting Employment of University Graduates</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th) The League for Promoting Employment of University Graduates from various universities in Peiping continued to send representatives, including Zhang Zhuoru and five others, to Gan to petition Chiang. After completing their mission, they arrived in Nanjing and, together with Tan Shuzeng and other representatives who remained in Nanjing, submitted a second petition to the Executive Yuan on the 6th. Chu Minyi received them, and the representatives presented two points: (1) Request the Executive Yuan to issue a document to the Jiangxi Bandit Suppression Headquarters to employ this year's university graduates, and simultaneously instruct all government agencies to employ university students as much as possible to alleviate the panic among graduates due to unemployment. (2) Premier Wang previously responded to the National Student Work Advisory Committee, stating that it would be established in August and that students would be able to offer opinions. However, the Ministry of Education is now preparing to establish an Academic Personnel Work Advisory Office, which is not limited to students and is organized entirely by the government. Students feel they have no opportunity to offer opinions, which does not align with what was previously heard. The representatives requested that the Executive Yuan instruct the Ministry of Education to proceed according to Premier Wang's original intention and adopt student opinions. Chu replied that he would convey the message to Premier Wang, stating that the first point could be fully adopted, while the second would be decided by Premier Wang.</p>
<p>Chaoyang College</p>
<h3>Flexibility Approved for New Student Enrollment Quotas</h3>
<p>The private Chaoyang College submitted a request to the Ministry of Education, citing Article 1 of the "Measures for Reporting by Various Schools and Colleges for the 23rd Year" stipulated by the Ministry of Education, which states that "Universities and independent colleges shall recruit new students by department, with students selecting their departments during the application process." Also, Article 6 states that "Independent colleges specializing in Category A subjects mentioned in Article 2 shall not recruit more than 50 new students and transfer students per department or specialized course." The college stated that its existing departments include Law, Political Science, Economics, and Border Administration. According to the aforementioned regulations, the college's total annual enrollment would be limited to approximately 200 students. However, historically, the number of applicants to the Law Department has been the highest. Therefore, the number of students enrolled in the Law Department, including freshmen and transfer students, has often exceeded that of other departments by several times. If the quota is strictly enforced by department, the enrollment of Law students would be limited, preventing many aspiring Law students from pursuing their studies, which would be regrettable. The college proposed to make adjustments within the overall enrollment quota of the four departments. If the number of Law applicants is higher while the number of applicants to other departments is lower, the college would allocate some of the unused slots from other departments to admit more Law students, but the total number would still not exceed the total quota for the four departments, thus balancing both legal requirements and practical needs. The Ministry of Education responded that if there are vacancies in departments other than Law at the college during the summer recruitment of new students this year, the Law Department may increase its enrollment quota accordingly, but the increase shall not exceed 80 students.</p>

<h3>Preparations for the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association</h3>
<p>A Meeting of County Representatives to be Held in Shanghai</p>

The participants unanimously agreed on the need to establish the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association and instructed the Shanghai County Education Association to send letters to various counties to solicit their consent. However, progress was delayed as the number of participating counties did not reach a majority. Subsequently, during the second discussion meeting of county education association representatives last month, non-participating county education associations were re-notified to solicit their consent. To date, over thirty counties have agreed to participate in the initiation. A meeting of county education association representatives will be convened in Shanghai within the month to discuss preparatory matters.</p>

<h3>YMCA Hosts Students Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>August 11th</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA has a dedicated department that specializes in assisting students studying abroad, assigning staff to handle these matters. It has achieved significant results since its establishment. This year, the YMCA is paying particular attention to this work and has printed a booklet titled "Assistance for Studying Abroad" and sent it to various government agencies and universities. As a result, the number of students from various places who have entrusted the YMCA to assist with their procedures this year is even greater than in previous years. The YMCA is wholeheartedly committed to this work and has sent letters of introduction to friends in Europe and America on behalf of the students, so that they do not have to suffer the hardship of being unfamiliar with the people and places. The YMCA is scheduled to hold a tea reception on the afternoon of the 11th (Saturday) at 4:00 PM in the East Hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA's new premises at Baxianqiao to bid farewell to the students studying abroad this time. It is reported that Li Zhaohuan, the president of Jiaotong University, will preside over the event, and individuals newly arrived in China from Europe and America will be invited to speak about the latest situations in various European and American countries. All students studying abroad this time, regardless of whether they have used the YMCA's services, are welcome to attend the event.

<h3>Records of Lingering Fragrance from the Emperor’s Incense</h3>
<p>— By Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Even when the Empress Dowager wanted tea, he was still the one who brought it to her himself. Naturally, the Empress Dowager wouldn't question him any further about it. Speaking of tea, I might as well mention that the Empress Dowager was a very knowledgeable "tea connoisseur." She had dozens of different types of tea leaves she often used. Jasmine and lotus were just the most common two. Many of the others had so many names that it was impossible to remember them all, and most were rare items never seen outside. Thus, there were names that even to this day, I still haven't heard anyone mention.</p>
<p>Although this train car was divided into four different rooms, the focal point of our interest was, of course, that small court on the train. Within this small court, one could freely issue different orders, instructing this orderly train to move forward, backward, or stop. Not only that, but the primary driving force behind all political, military, and economic changes and adjustments in China was also within this small court, which only occupied half a train car. In these few short days, none of the Empress Dowager's edicts were issued from anywhere else.</p>
<p>Between our lounge and this small court, there was also a very exquisite wooden partition. At the top of this partition, there was a very solemn and opulent canopy, like an open umbrella covering the space above. Beneath it was the Empress Dowager's throne. In the palace and in the Summer Palace, there were as many as ten or twenty thrones prepared for the Empress Dowager. Their sizes were larger than the one on the train, but their appearance was generally beautiful, without any difference in quality. The raw materials for these thrones were all made of the most precious rosewood, and they were covered with countless pearls and gemstones, which glittered dazzlingly at night. However, to ensure comfort for the person sitting, the cushion could not be made of jewelry. But even a simple apricot-yellow velvet cushion was already quite striking. (100)</p>
<h3>Biography of Governor Mosquito</h3>
<p>— By Qing Qu</p>
<p>The governor's surname was Wen, and his lineage had lived in the wilderness for generations. Known as "Zijue," he often craved human flesh and skin, never satisfied until his belly was full. When he left, he would fly and buzz, his voice like thunder, keeping people awake all night. Therefore, everyone detested him and added a "bug" radical to his surname, posthumously naming him Mosquito, to show their deep hatred. Later, in Jiangdong, there was a "Mosquito-Mother Bird," also known as the "Vomiting-Mosquito Bird," which was good at singing at night and vomiting mosquitoes among the reeds. This was especially common in Huzhou. There was also a "Mosquito Tree," whose fruit resembled loquat. When ripe, it would split open, releasing mosquitoes until the spring and autumn, leaving the shell empty. All of these were his descendants. Thus, his offspring thrived, and at the beginning of summer, they would always lead their kind, opening their greedy mouths wide, sucking human blood, not stopping until the body was completely covered in wounds. People who suffered from malaria experienced alternating chills and fever. Doctors said, "This is the mischievous work of mosquitoes." They prescribed quinine to overcome it. However, treating the symptoms is not as good as treating the root cause. In Japan, there were wild boars who claimed to be able to expel them, using their technique of producing green mosquito coils, which were lit with fire. The resulting smoke and flames rose, filling the room, and the mosquitoes dared not enter. However, the wild boars were known for their inferior goods and were rejected by the world. Samsung W敵 rose up to replace them, but the mosquitoes' tracks never disappeared, constantly lurking beside the bed, disturbing people's peaceful dreams. Those who hid during the day and moved at night, clinging to their mistakes without repentance, were killed in the palms of our hands countless times. This year's severe drought has reduced the number of mosquitoes. However, the wealthy are still afraid of them lurking and have used flit to search and destroy them, achieving great success and being known for their eradication.</p>
<p>The author says, "Governor is an official title, used to expose illegal acts and supervise prefectures and states." Gu Tinglin of Kunshan once discussed this. Mosquitoes appropriated the name of this title and eventually became a scourge to the world. How could those who established the official position have foreseen this? However, mosquitoes are small creatures. They satisfy their desires, buzzing, and still know how to express their lip service, while the masses exhaust their resources to offer them up, and exploit and extort without sparing any effort. What is that? Alas, this is probably because mosquitoes are not as good as these, mosquitoes are thus far and gone.</p>
<h3>Cold Noodles</h3>
<p>— By Yangzijiang</p>
<p>In hot weather, laborers can't afford soda or ice cream. Moreover, soda and ice cream only quench thirst but don't fill the stomach. In this case, cold noodles become their only necessity. Although they can't quench thirst, they can cool the heart, and, what's more, they fill the stomach! "Cold noodles! Cold noodles!" In the early morning, waking up on a reed mat, there is a long, drawn-out voice shouting in the alley. The children of the landlord's family like to eat it the most, and the old clerk at the leather factory across the street always has his share too. Sometimes I walk over to the window to take a look. On the surface, it looks quite clean and presentable. There are six or seven green enamel bowls in a row, filled with soy sauce, vinegar, chili oil, sesame oil, old ginger slices… The noodles are covered with a white cloth. You can buy a bowl for six coppers, or a bowl for ten coppers. The quality and quantity are directly proportional to the amount of coppers, but regular customers can occasionally get an extra bargain, like the old clerk across the street that I saw.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, around four or five o'clock, the days are long in summer, and it's not yet time for dinner, but the stomach is already hungry. The cold noodle vendors are experienced and always hear them say, "Old Clerk, it's five o'clock, are you hungry? Come and eat cold noodles!" Although the old clerk will sometimes get a rebuff when he has no money, eight or nine times out of ten, the shout is successful.</p>
<p>Hearing the long, drawn-out cry of the cold noodle vendor, my mind always involuntarily flashes back to a memory: my mother loved to eat "clean cold noodles." I just don't know if there will be "clean cold noodles" to eat in the countryside this year after the severe drought.</p>
<h3>The Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 32: The General Enjoys Himself with Music and Women, the Soldiers Weep, How Many Return?</p>
<p>The messenger said: Please don't panic, let me check. So, he took out a register of wounded soldiers from the desk drawer, opened it, and before he could even turn a page, Gui Zhi couldn't help but squeeze forward and strain her eyes to see. Mrs. Guan also stretched her head forward and shouted: My child's father is called Guan Yaowu. The messenger was already flipping through the names of the wounded company commanders. He casually replied: That's right. Mrs. Guan was overjoyed and squeezed forward again, saying: Is it him? Thank God. She patted her child's shoulder and said: Xiao Niuzi, your dad is back! The messenger looked at him and said: Aren't you surnamed Guan? Mrs. Guan said: Yes! We are surnamed Guan. The messenger said: I mean, there is a wounded company commander, this company commander is correct, he is from Ping'an Fort, but he is not surnamed Guan. Old Mrs. Tian chimed in: Is he surnamed Tian? The messenger shook his head and said: He is not surnamed Tian either. Gui Zhi had been standing on the side listening blankly. When she heard that the wounded company commander was neither surnamed Guan nor surnamed Tian, she naturally assumed he was surnamed Zhao. She said: What is his surname, please tell us. The messenger said: His name is Yin Deren, do you know him? These three women, old and young, looked at each other, unable to speak. Gui Zhi was the first to speak: Even if it is Company Commander Yin, we have to go in and ask. Old Mrs. Tian said: He is in the same battalion as my son, we must ask. The messenger looked them over and nodded, saying: Even if you three don't say it, I understand. I can't make this decision, let me go and ask the doctor first. He went in, came out again, and said: The doctor said: Those three company commanders also contributed to the country. You three are here, I can't refuse to help. But our rules here are that you can't visit the wounded soldiers all at the same time. Please let this old lady go first, then Mrs. Guan, and then this Mrs. Zhao will please wait a little later. Anyway, one person only goes in for about ten minutes, it won't be long. Gui Zhi thought, I am the youngest, this arrangement is very fair, and repeatedly said "Okay." So, the messenger led them in, letting them sit in the waiting room, and first took Old Mrs. Tian in. Gui Zhi sat on a chair in the waiting room, lowered her head and just looked at her fingernails, and did not speak. Mrs. Guan, however, sighed every so often. (451)</p>
<h3>Our Country's Urgent National Defense Construction</h3>

<h3>Chickens in Front of the Restaurant</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xinzi</p>
<p>Every day, every day, walking past that restaurant, every day, every day, I see an empty carrying pole resting there. Not far from that carrying pole, a pile of tied-up chickens crouches.</p>
<p>They do not make any noise; they are very quiet and huddled together, turning their eyes and staring straight at the passersby. Although there are no tears in their eyes, they can easily evoke people's pity.</p>
<p>The sound of knives sharpening in the restaurant never stops. The tied-up chickens in front of the door seem to understand the purpose of the sharpening knives, and they are startled. A butcher, with a bright, sharp knife in his hand, casually picks up one. At this time, you can hear its mournful cry, "Cluck! Cluck!" The butcher kills chickens without batting an eyelid, cutting deeply at its throat. At the same time, the scarlet blood flows into the bowl placed on the table. Its legs stretch and struggle desperately, but in the end, it is still slaughtered. At the time of death, "Cluck! Cluck! Cluck!" it lets out its final mournful cry! "Flap! Flap! Flap!" it shakes its wings, making its final struggle!</p>
<p>This small animal! Chicken! Even as it is being slaughtered, at the moment of death, it still cries and struggles. What about humans, who are called the spirit of all things? If they were slaughtered, what would they do? Would they just lower their heads and let themselves be slaughtered, without any courage to resist and struggle?</p>
<h3>Hierarchy</h3>
<p>— (Yang Yusheng)</p>
<p>At midnight, on Avenue Joffre, I saw a column of bicycle patrolmen. Frenchmen in the lead, followed by White Russians, then Annamese, and after the Annamese, Chinese!</p>
<p>This reveals to me that there are so many levels of hierarchy among the world's nations!</p>
<p>Assuming in the British Concession, the International Settlement, and even in places like Lushun, Dalian, and the four northeastern provinces, the British and Japanese, not to mention, even Indians and Koreans have to stand in front of the Chinese! This makes me feel somewhat disappointed! But then I think of the black slaves and Native Americans in the world, they have to stand behind the Chinese, right?</p>
<p>The basis for which the Chinese can still "feel proud" is probably in this!</p>

<h3>The Slums of Beiping</h3>
<p>— Hong Kui</p>
<p>Anyone with even a slight concern for Beiping will surely know that Tianqiao is the bustling place where common people gather. To put it more broadly, if you care at all about the living conditions of the lower-class common people in China, then you will not overlook Tianqiao in Beiping, because Tianqiao in Beiping is indeed a world-renowned, prosperous slum.</p>
<p>If you were to carefully analyze this slum, it's quite like the amusement parks of Shanghai, with merchants, various stalls, theaters, restaurants, brothels, bathhouses, fortune-telling through character analysis, all sorts of things, everything you could want. The difference is that it is a vast open square, entirely covered with cloth canopies forming square compartments, big and small, a mixed jumble, squeezed together; most of the surrounding area consists of the residences of ordinary people and brothels that trade in human flesh, and even the few tall buildings and elegant pavilions are nothing more than warehouses of wealthy merchants or small leather goods factories. If you don't have half a cent in your pocket, you can still stroll around and see the entire scene, guaranteed to satisfy you; if you want to act a bit extravagant and spend five dimes, you can have a thoroughly enjoyable time.</p>
<p>In this hot summer weather, the fierce sunlight mixes with dust and sand, flying about. Generally, penniless people have faces full of greasy sweat; probably they don't even know about weather that's over a hundred degrees? They also probably don't know that there are virulent microbes in this dust? Young women with red shirts, green trousers, and bound feet, clinking and clanking along, still carry small umbrellas and wipe sweat as they look around; itinerant performers with bare chests and exposed shoulders, vigorously peddle their skills to the sound of gongs and drums; the elder sisters singing ballads, squinting with shy eyes, barely raise their clear voices; they seem never to have slept, constantly showing signs of fatigue; those dressed in dragon robes and wearing tall crowns, reveal playful and leering expressions amidst the audience's clamor; the rank and rancid smell emanating from mutton noodle stalls and shops selling various foods, assaults the noses of the general audience in waves; to them, it seems to be of no concern.</p>
<p>In addition, there are wrestlers, singers, dancers, male and female, they have no sun-shading canopies, but they do have dark skin, enduring the scorching heat of the fierce sun, letting the beads of sweat roll down their powdered faces one by one, congealing into moisturizing lotions.</p>
<p>From ten o'clock in the morning, they have to get dressed up, until eight o'clock in the evening, the price of their labor is truly pitiful, it is said that the biggest troupes only make a little over ten dollars! For example, in a troupe of more than ten people, the distribution—no, rather than calling it distribution in a formal sense, it would be more accurate to say control, because the troupe leader has absolute power of exploitation; among them, the men and women have their own levels of status, how can they get their due share of the average price! Therefore, we should not be surprised by the different kinds of encounters they have at night.</p>
<p>The summer sunlight bakes hotly on their heads, but their lives continue to struggle in this bustling place, continue to endure the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, while squandering their vibrant lives; their entire existence has built this Tianqiao into a place bound for prosperity!</p>

<p>Failure to Complete Supplementary Margin Calls Leads to Suspension of Flour and Wheat Trading</p>
<p>The flour market has seen active spot and futures trading. Due to the increase in flour prices at the exchange auction, supplementary margin calls were required, amounting to 600,000 to 700,000 bags. As these could not be completed promptly, the market was suspended for the entire day.</p>
<p>The wheat market faced a similar situation due to the flour market suspension. After the prices soared by 20-30 cents the previous day, the previous margin funds were exceeded, so brokers were immediately notified to pay the price supplement. As the supplementary margin calls were not completed on that day, there was no trading in the wheat market in the morning or afternoon.</p>
<h3>Special Cart Wheat Called Up to Four Dollars and Forty Cents</h3>
<p>(Spot Flour) Has risen to $2.85, the market lacks spot flour, and sentiment remains bullish.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ke Rice Wanted to Fall but Stopped</h3>
<p>As Raised by the Jiangxi Procurement Office</p>
<p>Yesterday's market situation for foreign Ke rice saw farmers' concerns due to a previously set Saigon shipment about to arrive, and two or three other ships already en route, expected soon. Moreover, after continuous procurement by the local street in recent days, appetite was satisfied, with no intention to procure further. Speculators disliked the high price and could not procure more. The recent surge in market prices, although influenced by water and drought disasters, was directly driven by speculators on the market. Now, with speculators ceasing procurement and even selling off their holdings, and the newly arrived Saigon rice not holding out for higher prices, mostly sold off at market rates, Saigon new rice owners were willing to sell off entire shipments at $12. Thus, market sentiment turned downward, and in the morning market, both machine-milled Ke rice and Little Wringing rice fell by a dime or two. In the afternoon, Jiangxi traders and local continued procurement, and the market gradually rebounded. Near evening, Little Wringing rice was even higher than the previous day's highest price, and market sentiment turned bullish again. For the whole day, 2,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 were opened, new at $12, old at $11, 8,000 bags of Little Wringing, at one point as low as $10.02-0.03 in the morning, rebounded to $10.05 and a half in the afternoon. Machine-milled rice opened 500-600 bags each, Shashi milled at $8.25, Machine Jing at $10.02-0.03. If local merchants continue to be greedy today, then the market will continue to look good, otherwise it may stabilize. However, outsiders, aware of the water and drought disasters in various provinces, are inquiring in the market and engaging in speculation and hoarding.</p>
<h3>River Below Rice Moves Back Down Slightly</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs still lacked the 13th and 14th (nearly 2,000 dan in total), the sales market was even more sluggish, and few customers inquired, likely because the two-day price surge was too much, causing market sentiment to pause slightly and become sluggish. The entire city did only 300-400 dan of business, so the market color suddenly fell downstream. If late rice falls back by 20-30 cents, various thick glutinous rice opened sparsely, falling by 40-50 cents. Du Yang Jian, etc., also carried a glutinous angle, only Yin Bian Yuan goods lacked stomach fragrance, still showing elegance. New glutinous rice still belongs to $11.20.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than ten sources from River Below various places, various colors on the market remained flat. The market form of White Glutinous rice, White Yuan, and Thin Rice was flat and tired, High Yang Jian added two or three cents, Medium Sub added a cent or so, and Port Customer Jian also added a foot or so. Dongxin glutinous rice stabilized.</p>
<h3>Oil Soybean Cake Rise Intensifying</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wind of oil market rise was still strong. It is estimated that soybean oil will continue to rise by one yuan, and peanut oil will also continue to rise by seven cents, because production prices are soaring, there are few sources, and the bottom is thin, so the market is firm and popular.</p>
<p>Old Yellow Soybeans first rose and then stabilized, the market calculated a rise of three or four cents to one or two cents. The market situation with Middle Pass goods the freshest, yesterday the factory shipped fourteen or fifteen cars of Yingzhou beans, prices from $3.50 to $4.00. Jiujiang traders shipped one or two cars of Zhengyang Pass beans, the price was $3.75, and there were speculators and local merchants who collected eleven or twelve cars of various beans, please read the market price column for the market situation. Because the sources of new beans are not connected, the price is more popular, Jiujiang Chengmen beans have opened at $4.00, Hankou June White opened at $4.20, a total of over four hundred bags of Chengmen beans were transacted, seventy-six bags of Jiangqiao beans, and forty-two bags of Liufangchi beans. The first batch of Jiujiang Three Sheep beans arrived, forty-six bags, the price opened at $3.95, the goods were middle class.</p>
<p>Because soybean prices soared, the merchants uniformly called firmly, and the procurement party did not look at the price, so they all had thoughts of trading, so it continued to rise by three or four points.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>The Rise of Flour and Wheat Affects Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>The yarn market tends to be firm, and the rise is sudden and sharp. Because the sales of spot yarn in recent days have been smooth, the procurement by various traders has continued without interruption. The market atmosphere is becoming more and more prosperous. In addition, recently flour and wheat have seen an alarming rise. According to some, cotton yarn may have the hope of being suppressed. Therefore, speculative merchants' activities have increased, so the closing price was quite excited, and the far month broke through the previous peak.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Buying Intensifies</p>
<p>At the beginning of the auction of yarn in the morning, the U.S. cotton rose slightly by five pounds of sound, but the market atmosphere was tightening, because the news of spot yarn on the previous day was good, and the popularity was good. Most of the discussions in the market at the 33rd game said that the price of flour and wheat would inevitably stimulate the yarn market. Some people have a strong concept of rising cotton yarn, so the buying trend is increasing, and the market price is rising game by game. It is said that the financial sector is buying and supporting it. As a result, each month rose by $1.10 to $1.67, with a total transaction of 26,300 bags. Kui sold 950 bags of Taifu, 800 bags of Tongji, 450 bags of Yukang, 1,800 bags of Dafeng, 1,200 bags of Jinchang, 1,250 bags of Yuanda, 950 bags of Yichang, 1,050 bags of Changfeng, and 1,650 bags of Shenyuan.

<p>Guangdong 300 Inland 465 Haizhou 100 Ningbo 5</p>
<p>Changsha 345 Fujian 10 North Gang 80</p>
<p>The cotton market has been hovering for several days, but now the wind of rising is more intense. The U.S. cotton is flat, and the price of flour and wheat has soared, which has caused the people in this city to tend to be firm. Some nervous people predict that cotton may have a drastic change. Therefore, buyers flocked to the market, and the market price rose sharply. However, the Tongzhou Gang and Yuanda sold a huge amount of goods, but the sales of spot cotton are still dull. According to a friend of a cotton store, the current production status of new cotton is still satisfactory.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rose by 55 Cents</p>
<p>The market opened sharply in the morning, the market was suddenly tight, and the buying was particularly strong. Most people hope that the soaring prices of flour and wheat will have the same rising power for cotton, which has aroused retail investors to buy more. As a result, the platform was tightened, and the situation changed suddenly. The market price opened and rose more and more. However, the Tongzhou Gang saw that the new cotton crop in that place was still good, and sold a lot of it, and the market price was slightly flattened. As a result, each month rose by 40 cents to 55 cents. The total transaction was 95,800 dan.

<h3>Waiting for the Government Report on US Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was mixed due to waiting for the government report. Later, it was firm due to lack of rain in the drought area and short accounts being made up.

<h3>Standard Gold Falling Trend Strengthens</h3>
<p>Silver Price Continues to Rise and Fall by $7.10</p>
<p>The gold market is getting worse and worse, and the falling trend is endless. People's hearts are extremely bleak. Although the Central Bank opened the spot market, the falling wind continued to be strong. The market was temporarily quiet due to the rumor of US inflation, and then stabilized after fatigue. At the beginning of the morning, it was reported that the British and American silver markets had squeezed too much, and the forward silver price on the Gold and Silver Exchange rose by one to six cents. London raw gold shrank by one penny, the exchange rate rose slightly, US cotton rose by eleven pounds of sound, US wheat soared by five points, stocks fell slightly, and the report said that the leader of the inflation faction of the US Congress, Thomas, was deeply dissatisfied with the government's current silver policy. General opinion believes that Senator Thomas and inflation lawmakers may continue to propose currency bills in the next Congress, that the immediate issuance of $50 million silver bonds is not enough for the government for two and a half months, and that the purchasing power of the US dollar is still $1.35, and if you want to increase prices, you must eliminate the extra $0.35. People's hearts were originally timid, and the market outside was prepared to trade, and it fell to $67.80. After opening, because the bank's appetite was strong, it was known that the HSBC Bank's British and American exchange rates would not move, and the Central Bank opened 1,400 pieces, priced at $969.40. The buying intention in the market was very strong, and it once approached the $70 mark. However, because the news from foreign telegrams was unfavorable, saying that the US President would sign and issue silver bonds after returning to Beijing, people's hearts were still timid, and those who sold at high prices suddenly surged. Speculator Wang tried to stuff US dollars, the domestic market was loose and flooded, and the situation fell down, gradually declining. In the middle, the Guang Gang and others still entered, but the selling atmosphere was pervasive, and the big households such as Fuxing Yongyuqing Yongdade Chengyuan Maoyong Tianfeng Yongyuanyi Bingxing and others quickly supplied it. The afternoon closing was the most tired. The market was still timid after the market. Then the Xinfeng Foreign Firm telegraphed that the US government had 20 million public bonds that would expire at the end of September. In order to prevent capital outflow, the inflation was temporarily suspended before the new public bonds were transferred. People's hearts were slightly happy, and the empty positions were made up at a lower price, and they were launched high. However, the Bombay telegraph rose by 7.7.7 Anna, and there was still hovering. People's hearts are still praying. The market will shrink Bombay by 33.4 Ann, and still open.

HSBC Bank posted quotes for both Sterling and US dollar, but they remained unchanged. The process seemed tight, but due to rumors of the US President signing and issuing banknotes upon his return to Washington, people were inherently fearful. Chinese merchants aggressively unloaded, and a major client, Mr. Wang, also sold. Although banks absorbed the supply, the situation gradually became excessive and unrestrained. Later, there were rumors that the New China Trading Company was delaying private sales due to inflated US dollar currency. Banks continued to absorb, but the process was gradual. During the process, Bombay rose by seven annas, maintaining a strong market, but later Bombay fell back by three annas, resulting in a tight market. The near-term selling prices at closing were one shilling two and seven-eighths pence for Sterling, and 34.5625 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, Sterling was down 0.125 and the US dollar up 0.3125. Chinese merchants absorbed slightly more than they unloaded, with approximately 800,000 US dollars being unloaded after offsetting. The day's trading prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Market Slightly Lively</h3>
<p>Short-term Interest Rate Remains at Seven Percent</p>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market was slightly more lively than the previous day. The short-term interest rate remained at seven percent in the morning and afternoon, without any changes. However, the interest rate for cash loans increased because the available funds in the market were insufficient, and demand exceeded supply. Therefore, the situation was slightly tighter than in previous days, and the rate gradually increased to seven percent, an increase of five points compared to the previous day. The transaction volume for short-term notes was over 4.1 million in the morning and over 400,000 in the afternoon. The transaction volume at the Small General Guild was over 300,000. The transaction volume for silver mortgage loans was over 2.1 million for both withdrawals and new loans. Bank receipts and payments included over 4.0 million for foreign banks' receipts and payments of notes, over 3.8 million for various foreign exchange mortgage and miscellaneous receipts and payments, over 800,000 for telegraphic transfers, over 1.4 million for foreign exchange settlements, and 700,000 for warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks' receipts and payments included over 3.8 million for receipts and payments of notes, over 4.5 million for various goods, foreign exchange mortgage, and miscellaneous receipts and payments, over 500,000 for telegraphic transfers, over 600,000 for customs duties, and 800,000 for warehouse entries. Japanese banks' receipts and payments included over 3.0 million for receipts and payments of notes, over 4.3 million for various goods, foreign exchange mortgage, and miscellaneous receipts and payments, over 1.1 million for foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 for warehouse withdrawals. Qianzhuang (native banks) and public foreign exchange receipts and payments totaled over 48.8 million, short-term cash loan receipts and payments totaled over 7.7 million, various remittance receipts totaled over 600,000, banknote recalls totaled over 800,000, issuance totaled over 1.5 million, cash receipts totaled over 300,000, and incoming and outgoing customer sources each totaled 300,000.</p>
<p>Additionally, the total amount exchanged at the local clearing house was 8,501,457.37 silver dollars, including 4,121,251.32 silver dollars and 4,390,206.55 yuan in drafts.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary Silver Coin Slightly Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Copper Coin Extends One Thousand Cash</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangsu subsidiary silver coin market opened at 835 yuan, down by five jiao (cents). The afternoon market was the same, with transactions occurring. The morning trading volume was 3,000 jiao, and there were no transactions in the afternoon. The Guangdong subsidiary silver coin market was at 729 yuan in the morning and 728.8 jiao in the afternoon, up by eight jiao compared to the previous day. The morning trading volume was 120,000 jiao, and the afternoon trading volume was 20,000 jiao. The copper coin also increased by 1,000 cash compared to the previous day, to 332,500 cash.

The 300 boxes of silver dollars were reported by the British Bank. It was heard that the other box was shipped by a certain Chinese bank.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>Fluctuation Limited to Five Fen (Cents) to One Jiao (Dime)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange rotated, becoming increasingly stagnant. Trading was quiet, with no significant activity from major players. The overall environment seemed to be improving, with Huang Fu's northward journey being only a matter of time. The Preparatory Bank was ready to request amendments, but the Ministry of Finance did not agree to be flexible. However, with both sides adopting a wait-and-see approach, the market remained stable, like calm waters. The future, after a period of rotation, should still trend higher, partly due to the prevailing environment and partly due to the large number of outstanding accounts, which cannot remain stagnant indefinitely. The market opened with a slight increase of three jiao in troop reduction bonds, suggesting a potential upward trend, but remained quiet thereafter, improving slightly by five fen to one or two jiao. The afternoon market was even more stagnant, with minimal fluctuations and mixed gains and losses, but with more losses than gains, only one or two jiao. Overall, the market prices showed mixed gains and losses, ranging from five fen to one jiao to three jiao. The total transaction volume was 6,661,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table below:</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Declines</h3>
<p>New China Trading Company reported that yesterday (6th), the New York stock market fell sharply due to unfavorable business news. The resurgence of inflation rumors caused gold stocks to fluctuate, and the market returned to stability at a higher level. At the same time, the continued drought caused coarse grains to rise, benefiting the stock market. However, at the closing, prices were uneven, and there was no evidence that the government had changed its attitude and was leaning towards inflating the currency. According to conservative speculators, there would be no inflation until after the issuance of public bonds in September. However, they believed that the government would focus on silver monetization and printing silver certificates to stimulate the economy. The bond market on the Small Exchange, except for mining stocks, trended upwards, with a total daily turnover of 780,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>| Date | August 4th | August 6th | Change |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 30 Industrial Stocks | 88.45 | 88.11 | Down 0.32 |</p>

<h3>Headcloth Indian Silk Exports Are Not Smooth</h3>
<p>The sales of headcloth Indian silk from foreign firms have been sluggish for a long time. Except for orders received by various manufacturers since February, there are very few spot transactions. Yesterday, Mei Feng Silk Factory had some sales, but the transaction volume was not high. The opening price was one yuan and one jiao per yard for 27-inch silk, and one yuan and six jiao per yard for 40-inch silk. It was heard that various export firms were adding orders and had some piecemeal shipments.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Factories Take Advantage of Low Prices to Replenish White Factory Yarn</h3>
<p>With abundant silk inventory overseas, the consumption of silk by various silk weaving factories has decreased daily. The supply of raw silk exceeds demand, and it is difficult to expect sales of Huanmei silk to improve in the short term. However, mainland silk factories, seeing that silk prices have fallen to the lowest level, took advantage of the low prices to replenish Shanghai white factory yarn, totaling 70 bales of grade B, but prices remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Italian Rayon Excels</h3>
<p>The rayon market was quiet yesterday, with sporadic transactions in various silk products. Italian goods were firm and expensive due to limited stock in warehouses, while Japanese goods trended slightly weaker. Tianzi and Nvzi goods each fell by five jiao per case, but transactions remained sluggish. The prices of Tarong transit goods are listed below:</p>
<p>150 Denier A Customs 410 yuan 120 Denier A 415 yuan</p>
<p>150 Denier B 385 yuan 120 Denier B 380 yuan</p>
<p>150 Denier C 370 yuan 120 Denier C 370 yuan</p>
<h3>Diplopia Silk Exports Total 756 Bales</h3>
<p>The sluggishness of silk sales in Europe and America has reached its peak. Chinese silk exports have reached the end of the road. In the second half of last month (July), exports of yellow, white, and gray silk threads to European and American countries totaled only 1,224 bales, while shipments of diplopia silk to India totaled 756 bales.</p>

<h3>A Review of "A Smaller Question" in the Mass Language Discussion</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, this newspaper published Mr. A Long's "A Few Words on Mr. Cao's 'Several Small Problems of Mass Language'". Although Mr. A Long has a "feudal mindset," he seems sincerely adding a "smaller question" for discussion after Mr. Cao's questions. However, he ultimately only saw the surface of the issue, thus misinterpreting many aspects of this historical development with the movement of the entire social relationship. Thus, we must correct and clarify Mr. A Long's view of the problem.</p>
<p>1. In this round of the rise and spread of various restoration movements, the re-emergence of the debate between classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese raised the issue of "mass language" construction. Of course, we dare not deny that there will be people who want to "show off" in this debate; however, the proposal of this issue will never be, as Mr. A Long said, entirely "created" by "idealism in the brain." It is important to know that everything in human society will never freely transcend history. The reason for the emergence and development of this issue is precisely determined by the objective conditions of history: it is a necessary product of the continuous development of productivity and production relations in today's society and the increasingly collectivized process of society. Moreover, the term "mass language" is precisely relative and not a vague, general term. "Masses" must represent the "masses" who bear the mission of historical development and the evolution of the times and can move forward. This is what we must recognize and not confuse.</p>
<p>2. Here, I must say that this is a major misunderstanding of Mr. A Long: insisting that "there is a need to discuss mass language and mass literature separately." Anyone who pays attention to literature knows that the concept of "mass literature" is not being proposed today; there was already a discussion and creation of it several years ago. However, the reason why it could not be developed universally is partly because the language used was not "mass." Therefore, there is an even greater need for a spoken language that the masses can say and understand, and at the same time a written language that the masses can read and write. However, it is definitely not the idealistic view of Mr. A Long that "one is for using the mouth and ears, and the other is for using the hands and pens." Although there is a difference between using the mouth and hands, these are both different ways and postures for us humans to express our thoughts. And how can you say that something representing language and written on paper can only be read and spoken with the eyes and not the mouth?! Originally, the most malicious reason for separating language and writing lies in the general conservative special class, who want to show their identity by circling in the solidified and rigid language that has become in the social evolution process. And the "mass language" we need must strive to avoid this kind of corruption. In addition to "mass language literature," there are also dramas, movies, etc. that also need "mass language"!</p>
<p>3. Of course, no one can deny that the cultural level of our lower-class masses is extremely low. Illiteracy accounts for more than 80%. However, the construction of this "mass language" will become the simplest, most universal, and complete tool for educating the masses. And the construction of "mass language literature" and other sectors such as mass language movies and dramas are relatively improving the cultural level of the masses and improving the mass living social movement. But it is definitely not, as Mr. A Long said, "there must be popular education...before there is a way to start," and it has become an isolated movement that does not have a fundamental social consciousness in history. Moreover, regarding literature, Mr. A Long has completely dismissed it by saying "being played with by a few intellectuals, fiddling with the pen, dropping the guns..." (In today's society, there are indeed people who do this kind of thing) and not seeing the objective fact that literature is precisely a reflection of human social life and at the same time a major condition for promoting social evolution.</p>
<p>4. Regarding the issue of discarding and developing dialects and local languages in the construction of mass language, there has been a lot of discussion in various aspects, and there is no need to say more here. However, it is definitely not, as Mr. A Long said, "because of the mass language, go to the masses to find it, it is really building a house on the road, it will not be completed in three years..." such an extremely idealistic view. You must know that the "masses" are definitely not dead things as you think, on the contrary, the masses are precisely the moving, living, and advancing masses in society! And the future "mass language" and "writing" will not only speak for the masses, speak the language of the masses, and speak to the masses, but will also be the masses automatically speaking what they want to say!</p>
<p>Because this "smaller question" is not so "small" and lonely, and limited by space, therefore, I cannot discuss it in detail one by one, but I finally hope that Mr. A Long can come down from the "five miles of fog" and temporarily put aside his inherent "thoughts" to see all aspects of the problem before speaking.</p>

<h3>Mourn Weinong!</h3>
<p>— Wu Sheng</p>
<p>I woke up early in the morning and went to the office, where I received an obituary announcing the death of Mr. Chunbo, Weonong's father! My heart was uneasy, and I silently thought that my friend must be weeping bitterly at this time, mourning for his father. I wanted to write a letter of condolence to restrain his grief, but unexpectedly, something unexpected happened: turning the page after the obituary, I was shocked by another "obituary" that caught my eye, which read, "The unfilial Han Yizhong cries to announce: My father Weonong passed away due to illness at the hour of Chou on the first day of the seventh month of the twenty-third year in his official residence in Xitang, Jiashan." Just a few lines of black characters. Really? My friend Weonong, has he left the journey of life and passed away?</p>
<p>Alas! What else can I say? I can only sob and shed tears!</p>
<p>Weonong, whose given name was "Tianzi" and who was also known as "Weiba", had devoted much effort to this newspaper. His articles were able to grasp the focus of the times, such as "How Many Chinese Citizens Are There?", "How to Treat Koreans?", "Water Dispute", "Mending Policy", "Human Inertia", "The Fallen", and other articles, which were able to painfully attack the difficulties of the times and vent with eloquence. What left the deepest impression in my mind was the article "In the Recommendation Shop" after the Shanghai War. For example:</p>
<p>After dinner, we sat and chatted as usual. Today, new information has been added, and the conversation naturally focused on the two newcomers.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law," what's your surname! Where is your home?" asked the old woman who loved to talk the most and had lived the longest among the many candidates.</p>
<p>"My surname is Wang, and my husband's surname is Zhang. My home is in the countryside of Liuhe," the young woman replied.</p>
<p>"Oh, is that the place where the Nineteenth Route Army fought the enemy the fiercest this year, isn't it?" the old woman seemed to remember this bloody history and said.</p>
<p>"Isn't it? If it weren't for that hateful enemy attacking, why would I have come to this place!" the young woman said, looking a little dim. "My family has always farmed in the countryside, and we were originally a well-off family. With the enemy's disturbance, alas, although people escaped, the house and all the household items were all destroyed by artillery fire. And where did the money come from to farm? Heaven does not forgive people, and then my husband got sick from anger. Alas, there are no household items at all, how can I not leave my newborn child to work as a wet nurse? It's a pity that my child, although only a few months old, is fatter than the fat officials in the city. Now that I have given it to someone, I can only let fate take its course! It is difficult for individuals to live, so how can I take care of the child! I" Although the young woman spoke very optimistically, her voice was already trembling.</p>
<p>"Alas, what a pitiful life!" many people said. The jealousy born of competition for selling labor has turned into sympathy.</p>
<p>The description of this kind of material is very needed at the present stage, and it is very precious.</p>
<p>When Weonong was a teenager, he worked as an apprentice in a store for several years. Later, he struggled hard and barely entered the Wuxi National College for supplementary studies. After leaving the National College, he drifted around until he joined the editorial department of a bookstore last winter. His spirit of hard work, diligent study, and humble questioning can be a model for our working youth. His simplicity and unpretentiousness in private life, and his amiable and approachable manner in dealing with people, are also rare in the current youth world. His temperament is very close to that of the Russian Tolstoy, more passive and less active, and he often advises his father to collect less land rent, showing his compassionate heart everywhere. Alas! Heaven did not give him many years, and such a middle-aged death means that the charioteers of the times have lost a capable "companion"!</p>
<p>Recalling this day last year, we both lived on Huade Road. We cooked our own meals, washed our own clothes, shared the spicy green eggplant, and drank from the same cup, fluttering as if we had the idea of transcending the world. Later, because of my job, I moved east and west, but there were still many opportunities to meet every week; until the spring of this year, you were sent by the bookstore to work in Suzhou, and the meeting period was interrupted, who would have expected that this spring farewell would become our eternal farewell?</p>
<p>One evening in the drizzling rain this spring, Weonong wrote his short essay about missing people in the drizzle, which included a few sentences saying: "In this desolate environment, it will make you think of endless past events and the memory of friends in the distance. I remembered Shan in prison, Yu whose life and death are unknown, Xiang on the road to Jinan..." Now Weonong is dead! Shan in prison, Yu whose life and death are unknown, Xiang on the road to Jinan, with the fellow writers of this newspaper scattered and reunited, when they learn of this unwelcome news, what will their feelings be after me?</p>
<h3>Ten Years</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>丨Remembering My Deceased Father</p>
<p>Ten years is a very memorable number. Truly, in numerical reckoning, it is so orderly, and in terms of duration, it is neither too long nor too short.</p>
<p>Whenever I think of ten years, whenever I think of the events suffered within those ten years, involuntarily, I become dazed, even to the point of losing temporary consciousness. Indeed, ten years has been too great a stimulus for me, too great. Even though it was just a small, short glimpse, yet, surging waves were crashing, and violent wind and rain were assaulting: This, this, wandering fate!</p>
<p>Fates are not the same for everyone, just as people's faces are not alike. Salvation? It is said to be impossible, naturally, this statement is directed at the lower classes. As for the upper classes, well, that is probably another matter.</p>
<p>What is worth being grateful for is that ten years ago, at this very time, my father fell ill. The onset was so fierce and dire that the people at home were shivering with cold. But shivering was useless. It would not lose its established power because of this. On the contrary, it gradually increased, increased, making the entire body feel as hot as fire.</p>
<p>Of course, this had to be treated. Although I knew very well that I was not strong enough, no, I was simply lacking, but for a family that made a living from manual labor, not to treat it? What a frightening prospect that vague future was!</p>
<p>Treatment began, and finally, treatment began. First thing: money! Second thing: money! Third thing: still money! With money, everything is easy to do. The mere mention of money gives us a headache. Truly, without permanent property, when someone who makes a living from manual labor falls ill, where can money come from? I was already of a relatively considerable age, which is to say, I already had a considerable memory in terms of perception.</p>
<p>It was the weather of late spring, March. In the north, it was a period of splendor. If one were to walk out of the ancient city gate and gaze at the thawing moat, before one's eyes: that vast expanse of green grass, those pairs of butterflies dancing, those willows swaying by the flowing water, and also, those early-maturing boundless wheat fields, all of these possessed a different kind of charm.</p>
<p>The only solution was to pawn, to sell. Only these two were the supreme saviors. But, pawn? Sell? Pawn what? Sell what? The monthly salary barely sustained life, so where could there be a surplus to prepare items for future pawning and selling?</p>
<p>Poverty and depression were pressing and tormenting. Ah, put on a brave face! Borrow from familiar friends!</p>
<p>A month later, the illness became more serious, more serious. Many people were discussing the arrangements for the aftermath. Needless to say, fear and anxiety were simultaneously gnawing at our hearts. Finally, finally, this fate was irreversible. How tragic it was! My father bid us farewell and departed! Departed, on a morning that can never be obliterated.</p>
<p>This, perhaps, is what you expected? We wandered, wandered, here, there. Like a drifting cloud, like a gust of wind, like a wave, uncertain, stopping, going, in severe cold, also in sweltering summer. Alas, a journey in the desert!</p>
<p>Bitter, sour, even spicy, salty, all of these have been forced, tasted. What has not been tasted is the sweetness of deliciousness!</p>
<p>Time, it actually ran so fast. In the blink of an eye, ten years have already passed. Although it was a small, short period, yet, in its evolution, it did indeed encompass a considerable period of time!</p>

<h3>Soviet Youth's Gliding Games (Middle)</h3>
<p>— (Moscow Correspondence) (Yin Yuan)</p>
<p>(II) Jumping from School with a Parachute</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's Aviation Chemical Society has opened a "Parachute Jumping School" in a village near Moscow. There, on clear weather days, we can see a magnificent performance of parachute jumping.</p>
<p>This new type of game is becoming increasingly popular, and the number of people learning it is also increasing day by day. When there were not even ten parachute jumpers a year or two ago, few people knew about this game; now it has become a mass game in the Soviet Union. This achievement is, of course, due to the Aviation Chemical Society School and its founder and leader, Moshkovsky. In February of last year, Mr. Mo (himself a navigator and parachute jumper) and two of his colleagues founded this school. Since then, thousands of people have graduated from this school and have been given the title of parachute jumper. Most of them have already experienced dozens of jumps, and hundreds of people have already become instructors.</p>
<p>Few parachute jumpers feel afraid when making their first attempt, because this type of jumping requires bold people to be allowed to perform it. Mr. Mo has established a record in this regard. He has jumped a total of one hundred and one times, and his two colleagues have each jumped approximately seventy or eighty times.</p>
<p>Mr. Mo's success depends on his ability to completely control his nerves. This is the first element for every parachute jumper, because it is fatally dangerous to open the parachute too late or too early. Therefore, it is necessary to first control one's nerves.</p>
<p>The learning period for this school is only set at ten days. During the learning period, students learn how to install and release this parachute, and are taught various theories of landing. The coaching at the school is excellent, so even though jumping is dangerous, in the school's history, there has never been a death or injury.</p>
<p>Now, it is again the middle of summer. Indeed, this is unexpected for me. In any case, I never thought of drifting in Jiangnan. Naturally, Jiangnan has a great reputation, and in terms of charm, it cannot be compared to the north. However, today, as I stand by the Huangpu River, as the water in the river crashes, as the specks of sail shadows jump before my face, I think, this is the day you bid us farewell!</p>
<p>Forever, I cannot forget those instructing words, which are powerful, shaking my eardrums. Please ease your uneasy mood.</p>
<p>Here, with the utmost respect, I wish your spirit to shine upon us forever.</p>

<h3>Living in a Foreign Land</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am an innocent child. After graduating from elementary school during the summer vacation, I was swept into this wicked society.</p>
<p>I now live at sea, no less than five or six hundred miles away from my hometown. Having never left my family before, everything in my daily life – clothing, food, shelter, and transportation – has always relied on my mother's care. Now, I am living in a foreign land, lonely and isolated. How can I not feel sad all the time! Sometimes, I even shed tears and cry softly, but who can know what is in my heart?</p>
<p>The other day, it was again the night of the full moon! I looked at the moonlight in the empty courtyard, dazed, completely lost in thought. Isn't that the娑婆 tree in the moon? There is still someone sawing it up there! I heard that it can never be sawn through. Suddenly, it seemed to turn into two rabbits, worshiping the lunar palace. I heard that these rabbits are lunar palace rabbits and have become immortals… And the rest… I remember all of this. It is a story that my mother and I often told when I was little, and we often used these stories as a way to cool off in the summer. Therefore, on this summer night with a full moon, it is even easier for me to recall everything from my childhood.</p>
<p>I was unaware of the passage of time. I just watched and looked. Before long, I vaguely heard the sound of the Jianghai Customs clock, ringing down, ding, ding, ding. I knew it was getting late, and I had to get up early again tomorrow, so I ran into the house to go to bed.</p>
<p>After undressing, the electric light was turned off, but the moonlight still shone onto the bedside from the window lattice. At this time, it made me toss and turn, unable to sleep. I thought, and thought even more. If I were at home, I would definitely be sleeping by my mother's side at this time! I got up and turned on the electric light again. May I ask, at this moment, who will comfort me? I am lonely, even more desolate, and feel endless sorrow. On this beautiful moonlit night, especially for me, this child, how can I give up my thoughts of my beautiful and close hometown?</p>
<p>Sir! Please answer me! I will be forever grateful. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Jian Ming bows</p>
<p>Answer: It is inevitable for a person living in a foreign land to miss home, especially since you are very young and have never left your mother for a moment. Being moved by the scenery, it is naturally easier to feel lonely and desolate. However, I hope you do not have to be sad or anxious, because it is inevitable for people to be a guest in a foreign land, and once you get used to living in a foreign land, you will no longer feel its bitterness.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons for "missing home": no one to take care of you in life, and a lack of comfort in spirit. When you are at home, you don't have to worry about clothing, food, shelter, and everything, but now you have to take care of it yourself. When you first do these trivial things in life, you always feel troubled, and you can't do them well, and there is no loving mother to take care of you properly and thoughtfully. However, I hope you do not give up doing these trivial things because no one is taking care of you, or be sad for yourself. Whether at home or abroad, you should always take care of yourself and should not rely on others. In the future, once you get used to doing these trivial things, you can not only reduce the pain of "missing home," but also develop your spirit of independence and diligence. Moreover, worries, boredom, and leisure time are closely related. If you are not free and have nothing to do, I am afraid you will not feel sad about the moon. So, finding more things to do is a great way to drive away sorrow. When you encounter annoyance that invades you, quickly find something to do. You can write a letter to vent your depression, you can find friends to chat and play chess to forget your sorrow. This method is very practical. You were full of complaints when you looked at the moon that day, but after you finished writing the letter, I think you may no longer be sad afterwards. Isn't it?</p>

<h3>The Idiot</h3>
<p>— Lin Bin</p>
<p>Last night, I dreamed again that the idiot was rolling in the street, covered in blood, which made me recall this tragic past again. I don't know why, but he left such a deep impression on me!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I am truly a hard-hearted person! I have witnessed people dipping snow-white steamed buns in the fresh blood of heads that had just passed under the train wheels and eating them; I have witnessed the corpses of small soldiers who had been hit by exploding bullets, torn to pieces, bloody and blurred, piled up at the train station. All these shocking and horrifying scenes only made me sigh, "How cruel humanity is!" and that was it. The impression left in my mind was like a leaf in a rapid current, immediately disappearing without a trace. Only this past event, which some people considered very ordinary, weighs heavily on my heart like a ten-thousand-pound stone, causing me to have bloody nightmares again and again!</p>
<p>It was the season of late autumn and early winter when a strange foreigner suddenly appeared in our village. His expression, which seemed both frivolous and simple, his tone of voice and smile, which seemed both happy and sad, and his words and actions, which were full of eroticism, immediately earned him the title of "Idiot," and the whole village was as excited as if they had discovered a priceless living treasure.</p>
<p>At night, he slept with three dusty Buddhas in an ancient temple that had long been without incense, two or three miles outside the village. During the day, he followed the rising sun to the village to be a wandering beggar. Whenever he saw young women in the streets, on the windows of buildings, in front of gates, or in courtyards, his purplish-brown face would immediately display a frightening grin, his eyes would glisten like grease, his thick, clumsy lips would crack open, revealing a row of yellow teeth coated with toothpaste, and he would make a rough, hoarse sound like knocking on a broken bamboo tube: "So beautiful, so beautiful!"</p>
<p>When his stomach was rumbling unbearably and he went from house to house begging, he received various different treatments. Some families closed their kitchen doors as if they were guarding against floods and wild beasts, ignoring him. Others slammed their fists heavily on the dinner table and shouted loudly: "Go, go, if you don't go, I'll skin you alive!" Sometimes, because of the idiot's obstinacy, they would reward him with a few slaps in the face and drag him out of the gate. But most families deliberately made him wait at the door, teasing him to tell jokes. The price of the jokes was, of course, some leftover food that was sour, smelly, and heaven-defying, prepared for feeding the pigs.</p>
