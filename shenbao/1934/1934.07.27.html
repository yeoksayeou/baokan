<p>奥總理陶爾斐斯博士。自民國二十一年五月。於危難之中。出任總理之職。二年以來。艱險備嘗。左則與社會民主黨相對壘。卒於本年二月。以鐵腕結束該黨在奥之勢力。右則與國家社會黨相搏鬥。不使該黨因希脫拉在德國方面之崛起。而得一德奥合併之機會。陶氏在職之日。抑制二黨活動不遺餘力。而今竟因國社黨攻入總理衙門。而以被殺聞。噩耗傳出。意大利欲增兵奥邊。德國亦下令封鎖二國邊境。舉國戒嚴。全球震動。現奥國總統美可拉斯。雖已任命敎育部長暫維大局。然國内秩序。仍在騷亂之中。中歐局面頓呈轉變。頗如投石於水。波紋四及。察其前因後果。有足使人注意者在。</p>
<p>奥國蹙處歐洲中心。本無獨立之可能。而聖日耳曼條約必使之獨立。經濟方面。以蕞爾之奥國。農產品旣不能自給。工業品又難推銷於國内外。徒因法蘭西及其與國欲維持凡爾賽系統之安全。使捷克及其他小恊約國不致直接受德國之威脅。同時使德意二强。不致直接發生接觸。故奥國得勉强保持政治上之獨立。然其國民以不滿於現狀。亟思改絃易轍。故左傾之社會黨把政於前。右傾之國社黨得勢於後。陶爾斐斯恃其基督敎社會黨之勢力。更利用保皇派之武力。周旋於左右二派之間妥恊旣無可能乃出之以屠殺與高壓政策。自二月間以機關槍大礮擊破左派後。識者皆知陶氏不過爲國社黨造機會。必至於有被國社黨傾覆之一日。蓋社會黨慘被殺戳後仇視陶氏者。向左旣無出路。乃競入向右之國社黨。以表示其懐恨陶氏雖以絞刑相威嚇。而不能抑反對者之怒潮。陶氏之政策爲維持奥國之獨立。然事實上奥國非與他國有經濟上合作。必無以自存德國與奥。在經濟上足可互相倚賴。所謂德奥經濟合作運動。自俾斯麥以來。鼓吹者不知凡。幾然此事實現。將危及小恊約國及法意二國之安全。故數年以前。國際法庭認二國之關稅同盟。有背於和約之精神。法國處此多事之秋。欲助陶爾斐斯而苦援力無多。故陶氏唯一出路。厥在向意乞助。二月政變以後。奥匈意三國已有恊作之企圖。然其成效尚微。陶氏於遇難之前。本圖一唔慕沙里尼。蓋亦爲此類問題謀解决也。</p>
<p>陶爾斐斯雖常以鐵腕制亂。而卒不能抑國社黨之暴動。此次殉於國難。亦大勢使然。所成問題者。陶死之後。奥將如何以维持此危局。而奥之問題固德意法諸國之問題也。希脫拉縱容亂黨。已引起各鄰國之非難而慕沙里尼又有德奥不許合併之聲明。足見德意衝突頗有可能。設奥之叛黨勢力擴大。則德法及德與小恊約國問之衝突。亦難避免。蓋國社黨在奥得勢。無異爲希脫拉施展其卍字旗於全奥德奥相併。僅一時日問題而已此事而果實現必使</p>
<p>捷克胆寒。而羅馬尼亞與南斯拉夫境内之奥人匈人。亦恐將揭竿而起。中歐之不寗。蓋意料中事。</p>
<p>說者每謂歐洲之和戰。寓於此號稱「小拿破崙」之陶爾斐斯身上今陶氏死矣。歐洲若何而能免於大亂。自爲今日最急切之問題也。</p>

<p>杜爾夫斯博士以農家子而恃其才能與機遇、得高躋總揆職、身不滿五呎、維也納人士贈以「矮相」之名、歐洲各國總揆年青而軀小者、實以杜氏爲冠、一九三三年歐洲風雲緊急之際、杜氏爲全歐注目之人物、其力抗希特勒勢力之侵入奥國也、衆目之爲如歷史上大衛之勇抗戈里亞士、蓋歐人以德國黷武精神日見滋長、咸有戒心、乃策勵杜氏爲抵擋國社黨狂瀾之中流砥柱焉、第杜氏亦爲歐洲獨裁者之一、且於一九三三年毅然廢除國會、故奥國等之尚民治者、亦菲薄其行、一九三三年之夏、倫敦舉行世界經濟大會、杜氏親往與會、其精神之活潑、意志之堅强、與夫忠勇盡其職責、甚受英人士之欽仰、</p>
<p>杜氏以一八九二年十月四日生於下奥地利亞省之台克辛鎭、家世業農、杜氏恒對其友好引以爲榮杜氏旣畢業於荷拉白魯恩學校、乃至維也納攻法學、繼至柏林研究國家經濟學、歐戰之初、杜氏自告奮勇、服役前綫、歷三年許、以勇武獲獎章數種、歐戰告終復求學於德、嗣服務德國農民恊會聯合會、平素雅好研究農業、後返國就下奥地科亞省農民聯合會秘書職、一九二七年任同省農會會長、</p>
<p>杜氏於晨民疾苦、知之良深、故在全國聲望日隆、歷任各職、輒爲農民謀求幸福、農民保險會之成立、及入口小麥與麵粉專賣之實行皆杜氏之力居多、</p>
<p>一九三○年七月二十二日、以農民代表之資格被舉加入奥國國有鐵路局、閱六星期、遂任該局副局長、更閱三星期、升任正局長、</p>
<p>一九三一年春、農務部長柴勒乞休、杜氏乃被任代之、一九三一年五月五日、布萊樞第二次内閣辭職、杜受命組閣、以總揆而兼長外交農林兩部杜氏之政府、以基督敎社會黨農黨愛國同志團人員合組而成、在國會中佔小多數、有時表决議案、輒僅獲一票之多數、以故於行政上至感困難、而戰後奥國憲法偏重民治、是以國會遇事輙雲雪斤斤與政府爲抗、杜氏在日内瓦進行談判、及應付因戰後不良影響發生之種種内政問題、與經濟風潮、往往爲國會掣肘、職是之故、杜與國會、勢成水火、更以國社黨與社會黨之衝突、延至一九三三年三月、政府乃毅然下緊急命令、禁止各種集會與示威、並限制報紙之言論自山、國社黨報紙乃肆意抨擊、而使政府體無完膚、然杜氏氣不爲餒、終乃解散國會、是年九月二十一日、復依非國會之基礎改組政府、兾使奥地利亞成「基爾特」制之國家、杜氏嗣後依非政黨之基礎、改造内閣、於是其本人遂爲實際的狄克樞多、兼管外交國防公安農務四部、且因是得一手統制軍警與輔助軍、自奥地利亞共和成立以來、軍人不得與聞政治、於此爲始、</p>
<p>杜氏實施强力政變後、政府中之法西斯派與民治派遂互爭大權、相持不下、是年九月、奥國舉行維也納脫離突厥衡軛二百五十年紀念大會時、杜氏向會衆演說、允使奥地利亞成一有權威而合作的國家、此言之發、蓋以平國社黨之氣燄、旋復在某處發言、否認渠之政府、可加以法西斯之名、目此而後騷亂與罷工、不時發作、維也納輒成巨大之軍營焉、</p>
<p>一九三三年之春、國社黨活動日甚、謠諑蠭起杜氏幾窮於應付、印斯白魯克省發生暴動、黨人</p>
<p>就逮者四十名、維也納亦多逮捕、至五月十六日、國社黨因違禁示威及從事其他活動而被逮者、逾二千人、</p>
<p>一九三三年五月杜氏之赴倫敦參與世界經濟大會也、國内大局瞬息千變、屢接敦促回國應付急變之電、此後數月、國社黨作亂無寗日、時於各處抛擲炸彈、並圖毀鐵道與公署、是年八月、德國慕尼黑屢發無綫電播音煽動奥國國社黨起抗政府、因是引起意法英三國政府對德之抗議、德當局初不以抗議置念、但未幾卒停止宣傳、然奥國國社黨是圖逞益力、故遂有十月三日行刺杜氏之舉、時爲杜氏四十一生辰之前夕、國社黨裴爾蒂氏在國會、向杜氏連發兩彈、僅傷其臂、杜氏受創後、至爲鎭靜、拒絕赴醫院就醫、步至門首、登車返家、戒勿驚擾、</p>
<p>杜氏時赴外國、一九三三年四月六月八月、三適意國、會其首相墨索里尼、九月之會、最關重要、意相曾向担任爲奥國助、敎皇亦援予金寳星、以嘉其治奥之功績、是年九月二十三日、出席日内瓦國聯大會、備受歡迎、各國政洽家對杜氏之景仰、於此可見一斑焉、</p>
<p>内衛團領袖史達漢堡親王、傾向法西斯政策、視杜氏爲甚、且促杜氏加嚴處沼社會黨、杜氏殊不爲然、因是彼此不睦、但杜氏卒於一九三三年十月十二日與史商獲妥恊全歐内衛團於是悉加入杜氏之「愛國陣綫」而史氏遂爲杜之右臂、此舉於奥至關重要、蓋往此奥國之三巨頭、即杜爾夫斯·史泰漢堡費少佐乃戮力同心以抗國社主義矣、一九三三年十月、德國退出國聯、繼往事大選運動、奥國國社黨之活動、因以稍衰、杜氏乃得從容鞏固其政策、而實施職團國之新憲法、不意木展厥志、而遭兇終、不特爲奥國之大損失、而全歐大局亦爲之搖動也、（路透社）</p>

<h3 id="c67">奥總理陶爾斐斯死後怎樣？野 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>（一）小拿破侖的地位</p>
<p>奥國總理陶爾斐斯被殺了，在這個時候，或者那些喜作危辭的政論家，要說這是第二次塞拉熱窩Ｓａｒａｊｅｏｖ了。這件事是否會釀成第二次塞拉熱窩，那要看歐洲負責政治家的對付，是否愼重，意氣或理智，是那一方面來得有力些，就直覺而看，陶爾斐斯的死耗，的確有釀成戰爭之可能。如果新政府壓不下叛亂，我們想那法國意國及小恊約國是否會派兵干涉，如果國家社會黨失敗而向德國境内退却，我們想德國是否會援助這些日耳曼兄弟，我們很盼望希特勒，墨索里尼及杜邁格等不要僅憑直覺，然而我們要認識這個事件的嚴重性。</p>
<p>爲什麽一個不滿五英尺長的袖珍總理，會對于國際之戰爭或和平有這樣大的關係呢，因爲他是奥大利獨立的代表，奥大利獨立，是凡爾賽系統的中心，凡爾賽系統是四年間的血戰結果，是多少寃枉骨寃本血堆成染成的。這個系統要用血用骨來建造，要破壞這個系統而建設别的系統也非有血有骨不可。現在陶爾斐斯已殺死，奥大利獨立成了很嚴重的問題。要保持凡爾賽系統的以及想破壞凡爾賽系統的已漸有短兵相接之勢，一幕旣已揭開，裏面是否便是武劇，即就很可令人担心了。</p>
<p>（二）兩年來的陶爾斐斯</p>
<p>陶爾斐斯所以能維持其政治生命兩年之久，也因爲他高興孤立。在外交上他主張維持奥國的獨立，在政治上他一向是個中立派。當民國二十一年五月的時候，社會黨與右黨互相攻擊，不能讓步。他的基督社會黨乃是維也納的保守分子和農村中的愛國分子構成的。他因不左不右而得由農業部部長，一躍而成内閣總理。去年春間，他便和社會黨反目，解散國會，同時，他不但解散社會黨的軍隊，更抄查國家社會黨的本部。去年九月，他和内衛軍合作，這是一個私人的軍隊，非常反動，陶爾斐斯用他們去應付左派右派，雖然大家宣傳這個軍隊會革陶爾斐斯的命的，然而到了現在，没有實現。</p>
<p>他在左右夾攻裏面，求着出路，所用手腕是很毒辣的。國社會因希特勒在德國之勝利，便大鼓吹德奥合併，德國方面的國社黨也從各方面帮助他們。希特勒的黨徒在僧城用無綫電廣播攻擊陶爾斐斯的演講，搖動了奥國人民心理，陶爾斐斯于是一方面捕緝境内國社黨領袖，一方面向國際聯盟求援。因爲奥國的存在和國聯的存在雖二而一，所以在二月間，英法意三國共同宣言，維護奥國之獨立。</p>
<p>内衛軍之助陶爾夫斯以清除社會黨爲條件，而社會黨也知道陶爾夫斯的獨裁對於他們不利。二月十二日社會黨宣佈總罷工，陶爾夫斯先發制人，用大砲機關槍　社會黨根據地毀壞了，殺了不少的左派領袖。那些仇恨陶爾夫斯的便起來加入國社黨，以圖復仇。他自從把社會黨消減後，便一心來對付國社黨。一方面制定一個獨裁的憲法，一方面用幽禁，充軍造林，以至于絞首等刑，來壓抑匣社黨，這次國社黨的暴動也可以說陶爾夫斯高壓政策的反應。</p>
<p>（三）爲什麽奥國要獨立</p>
<p>爲什麽陶爾夫斯死不得呢，因爲只有他才可以使奥國維持獨立，爲什麽奥國非獨立不可呢，因爲奥國一動，歐洲地圖便會變色，奥國是不能獨立的，在經濟方面，地的農業旣不能自供自給，她的工業更要别處的市塲，自凡爾賽和約以後，奥國像一個肥人，剝得只剩一副瘦骨，工業漸漸的消滅了，銀行破產了，民國十二年開始，奥匣的財政，便靠國聯的借債來維持，國聯派了一個專員駐維也納，一切財政在他的手裏，如果奥國和德國合併，則經濟方面兩可互助，何况况奥二國，人種相同，文化亦相同，國社黨要奥大利的國民名希特勒的來統治奥大利，未始没有理由。</p>
<p>然而聖日耻曼條約不准准奥合作，更有理由，奥入於德，德國添加了六百萬人口，捷克的生育成問題，因爲這樣一來，捷克　　個包在德國裹面去了，德國的南邊國境，會和意大利接壞，而在東部，與匈牙利接壤，結果使德國在東歐及巴爾幹處南面王的地位，而且在捷克境内有三百萬德國人，共所住地方多與德奥接壤，一旦德奥合併，捷克便没有理由勸這三百萬德國人留在異族的國旗下面，但是　果這三百萬人叛變歸德，總數一千四百萬的捷克人口，去了四分之一，　　區域喪失，捷克還成共爲國嗎。</p>
<p>何况捷克國中，更有些非捷克人民，久思脫離，如六十九萬的匈牙利人，便是戀戀于祖國的，捷克如果因奥之獨立而失其存在，則歐洲地圖更要不同了，小恊約國中，南斯拉夫和羅馬尼亞都是獲利於凡爾賽系統的，其境内之異族定思叛變，匈牙利人，一定也來一次「歸於故國」的運動，而波蘭方面，因捷克之消滅，不但失一位反德之助手，更使德國侵入波蘭之機會加多，意大利對於凡爾賽系統並無愛好，然而她在大戰以後，也得到了住着日耳曼人的德魯爾區域及舊奥國所領的許多海濱屬地，墨索里尼與希特勒隔着一個奥大利不算不是意氣相得之友，一旦奥大利消滅，日耳曼人再度亞爾卑斯山進窺羅馬，則非意大利人所能安枕不憂的。</p>
<p>所以，陶爾夫斯死，奥國獨立發生動搖，奥國不獨立，歐洲的新邊界，都像朽索一樣，搖搖欲斷。</p>
<p>（四）列强將如何對付</p>
<p>德國的希特勒對於這次奥國的叛黨，其地位很像在歐洲大戰將發生時的威廉二世對於奥國政府，在事實上德國是可以支配的，而列强對於奥國的一舉一動，都認爲是德國的吩咐，我們要問德國將怎樣對付，則要看希特勒在德國地位，無疑的他的地位已非黨動搖，他正想有什麽機會，把國人的目標轉到外面去，内政失敗，往往用武功來修飾，何况以德國人的愛國熱，對外强硬，他們便會來擁護領袖的。</p>
<p>意大利是不會讓國社黨在奥國執政的，墨索里尼已一再宣言，奥國的獨立是要維持的我們要問，假使新内閣推翻，國社黨執政，意大利會派兵干涉嗎，我想意大利不會取單獨行動，而英法會和意大利合作的，國際聯盟是爲維持凡爾賽系統而設立的機關，在此際一定要應用一下，如果奥大利弄到國際共管的地步，也難保國社黨不在内起事，這個棘手的問題，如果不用冷靜的謹愼的頭腦去解决，結果會　亂子。</p>
<p>法國和小恊約國，無疑的是要懲罰國社黨的，何况，如果意大利也肯來參加，他們更得到勇氣，英國也怕德國膨脹而對於國社黨的行動，輿論定示不滿，不過她的態度，不會如法國之積極，現在這個關頭，最可注意的還是希特勒的態度，如果他要背城借一，用奥大利問題來發洩他當政以來的積怒，那是寗爲玉碎不願瓦全的政策，一定可以得德國人民之擁護，然而結果不可設想，如果他肯讓步，讓國際聯盟來處理奥國，而讓國社黨受到懲罰，那麽，他自已在德國的權威又不知能維持得好久，</p>
<p>有人說國社黨這次起事，和希特勒與墨索里尼前次會晤有關，或才意德已有諒解，然而這個推測，没有充份證據，也只有留作參考罷了，（七月二十六日夜九時）</p>

<p>丨答朱明君丨</p>
<p>朱明君說「朝野人士」都注意民衆的生活問題，其實「朝野人士」不見得眞的都能誠心注意民衆生活問題的。我們如果研究現社會的機構，便知道在社會裏，有些人雖然希望社會進步，而且也能促進社會的進步，但有些人却爲着自身的利益而極力使社會落後，懷古和迷信運動就是這一流人所企圖的。這樣的人不單只在中國才有，即在其他資本主義各國也是一樣，我以日本現在也有所謂的佛敎大同盟，歐美各國的敎會仍在社會上有很大的作用，這些東西，使社會開倒車的作用實在不少。</p>
<p>中國社會現在的災象是非常矛盾的：在長江流域因爲不雨而成爲旱災，在黃河流域却因爲雨多而成爲水災，這種矛盾的災象的形成，天時不好，固然可以說是一種原因，但最主要的原因還是社會的原因。如果這社會裏不要有那麽多熱心懷古和恢復迷信的人，像他國一樣地能努力用科學方法補救，則災害至少也不會那麽嚴重，然而中國的社會要想用科學來補救無在是不可能，因爲科學的補救首先要打破一切神權和迷信，正限地去觀察自然，觀察社會，進而征服自然，推進社會。這樣的事，對於社會上某些人的利益是完全抵觸的。所以，這些人就寗可停滯在二千年前的迷信生活裏，不願使人們對科學睜開了眼睛。</p>
<p>在這些人的懷古之情下，少數的民衆是不免要受愚的。然而這受愚一定不久，因爲幻想的行爲對於民衆不會有眞正的益處，遲早總會暴露出來。尤其是稍有科學常識的人，更不會受愚，也不應該受愚，我們要起來消極地反對設壇求雨一類迷信行動，同時要反對整個懐古運動。</p>
<p>關於科學造雨的原理，明白再講。（未完）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我們在服待伊睡覺的時候，自已當然也不能不睡，但只能伏在地板上或把身子靠在牆壁上和衣假寐，如其不幸而你的鼾聲發得太響，以致驚醒了太后的好夢；那雖不至殺頭，但一塲没趣是討定的了！我每逢輪到値夜的日子，往往不能熟睡，宫中的那一派空洞沉寂的氣象，老是在我的腦神筋上湧現着。我還時常想到爲什麽太后所拘泥着的那些專制不堪的政策，會使光緒感覺到不快？它的原因多半是因爲光緒這個人是富於民主主義的思想，母子問的觀念旣根本不同，當然没有什麽感情可言了！</p>
<p>如今回想起來，那時候我在太后的臥室中服侍伊睡覺，形式上是躺在伊的龍床的旁邊，實際上却不啻是坐在一頁中國歷史的角上。</p>
<p>那些宫女們也有一輛專用的車子，便在女官們所乘的車子的後面，意思是便於互相招呼；不過伊們的一切事情，都得自已去收拾，並没有人服侍的。</p>
<p>我們八個女官却另有四名太監，和四名僕婦，指定着給我們服務的。他們分兩起太監合太監，僕婦歸僕婦。躺在我們那輛火車的兩頭，每天替我們收拾床舖，預備臉水，打掃地板。去的時候是如此，回來的時候也是如此。不過有一點是使我們非常不便的，便是在路上無澡可洗，幸而這一次的旅行。畢竟祇是很短的一段，又喜天氣也不甚熱，勉强還可以挨得過去。太后平日是最愛潔凈的，洗澡洗得很勤，可是在車上·却也極感洗澡的不便，没法只得時常揩揩身，洗洗脚，聊爲代替。而當伊在揩身洗脚的時候，火車便又得特地停下來。帝皇家的生活，誠然是非常可羨的，就是在火車上旅行的當兒，還是能够盡量的發揮他們的權威；但打另一方面想一想，却又令人感覺到這種生活實在是太刻板，大拘束，太無意味了。（九二）</p>
<h3 id="c199">天津衛和三不管 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 沙金</p>
<p>在天津，也常發現着歪戴着帽兒，敞着大衫的領口，捲起袖子，大搖大擺的人們。正和在上海常看見人挺着肚皮，翹着大拇指說，「啊拉上海」的神氣没有兩樣，這些人們的口角裏當掛着一句說話，道：</p>
<p>「咱們天津衛」。</p>
<p>說天津，倒没有什麽：要是說「咱們天津衛」,感覺就有些不同。是啊,它的來歷可也就不小。</p>
<p>據說,這渤海重要門户的天津,古時本稱「海套」,係河問府的津海鎭地方。明代,因倭患置衛所於此，纔呌天津衛。清朝，由衛升州，升府：民元以來，又由府改縣：現在天津市和天津縣的名稱同時存在。它經過不少的變遷，可是，「天津衛」的名兒仍就帶着習慣性的保留着，在「咱們天津衛」的社會羣裏保留着。</p>
<p>話說到這裏，我們要來紹介天津市的三不管。</p>
<p>未談本文，先得賣關子。記得有句說話道，「天不怕，地不怕，只怕打官話」。這不過是「兩不怕」而已。三不管的地方，却是眞正的三不管。倘若您能這樣解釋說，「三不管者，你不管，他不管，我也不管之謂也」，您就懂得了這三不管，算滿不錯。</p>
<p>話要說回來了。</p>
<p>却說，這三不管正是「咱們天津衛」人物薈萃的所在，也就是中國界和法租界日租界毘連的地方。</p>
<p>這兒，有的是，落子館，嘣嘣兒。聽戲，看電影兒，以及吃鍋貼兒，喝五加皮，也隨我們的便。</p>
<p>還有「花姑娘」……。</p>
<p>有時，「咱們天津衛」來客串個「刀劈三關」，或者是「斬蔡陽」。聽說是爲了「烏龍院」傷了和氣，又說是「李逵奪魚」不够朋友：而使得這些「大爺們」火起來，耍一耍「春秋刀」。</p>
<p>這地方，這些吃大蒜的民族英雄性的表演是很够瞧的。</p>

<p>— 阿絜</p>
<p>咱們的芳鄰，雖不能比上靜安寺路赫德路等公館區，居然也靜悄悄地一條甚麽「村」，甚麽『坊』，從前的甚麽里·」似乎比不上它的摩登。村口也有腰間佩槍的巡捕，村裏也有不少的汽車。早晨晚上，凉風吹在樹葉上，很有些田野風味，幾家俊俏的娘姨，往往推着小寳寳的睡車，和别家的男僕搭訕頭。你想！咱們的芳鄰，不是小資產階級，也是銀行錢莊的經理，洋行買辦的公館了。其實你猜的一些兒不對。</p>
<p>芳鄰A·是金子交易所裏的代理人，搶帽子，割飛頭，一天裏撈三四十元，不算甚麽稀罕。他是二十一二歲的小白臉，女朋友進進出出的很多，夜裏不是跑跳舞塲，便是回力球，跑狗。這幾天天熱，二點鐘以後，他還不高興睡覺，手拉胡琴，口哼京調，十分高興。他的太太，年齡似在三十左右，手叚十分闊綽，打扮非常妖冶，又抽上一口烟，這位小白臉先生，却鞠躬如也，相敬如母。據說，這不白臉先生自得着太太以後，做金子的魄力，益越雄厚了。</p>
<p>芳鄰B，說出來諸位有些不相信。原來他家裏也是全紅木傢具；無綫電，淴浴間，一應具全。他的職業是汽車夫，並非貴東翁特别優待，薪工特别優厚，外快特别多。不過貴東翁的小姐，曉得他做汽車夫的苦處，特别看重他，特别照應他，使他成立了一個汽車夫的小公館罷了。</p>
<p>芳鄰C的職業，尤奇特了，他僱了不吃飯不給薪的賺錢夥計二三個，今天和尚來唸經，明天道士來打醮，說是醫院，又不是醫院。說是寺菴，又不是寺菴。說是棧房，又不是棧房。可是他的職業，能够爲人治病：又能够預知吉凶；又歡迎太太小姐們，在他家裏打牌，抽烟，唸經·拜佛。他所僱的夥計，鎭日價危坐堂上，無須做事，而能够代老闆賺錢。開『佛店』，不是他老人家撈錢的好賣買嗎？</p>
<p>還有芳鄰D，是白相人嫂嫂；芳鄰F，是買空賣空的落伍政客：芳鄰E，是著名的江湖半仙客：囉裏囉唦，在下没功夫給他們做傳，不過住在亭子間裏一月，自漸形醜，快快拔脚搬塲。</p>

<p>第三十二回　聲色自娱將軍終日樂老少環泣戰士幾入回</p>
<p>江氏心裏明白，這就是師長，立刻蹲下身子下去，請了個雙腿安全師長這才將口裏啣的烟捲，拿了出來，向身邊痰盂子裏，彈了一彈灰，然後問道：你貴姓是……江氏道：我姓楊。全師長道：你們也作的是糧食買賣嗎？江氏道：我們親家作的是糧食買賣。全師長道：什麽？你和對門糧食店是親戚嗎？江氏道：不是，我親家在這糧食行裏管過賑。全師長道：你說的親家，是他將女兒給你，還是你將女兒給他？江氏道：他的兒婦媳，就是我的姑娘。全師長道：你幾個女兒？江氏道：就是一個。全師長問到這裏，自已緊張起來了，突然伸直了腰坐着，問道：他出了門子没有？江氏雖覺得這位師長問話，未免過於嚕囌，但是自已到了這地方來，也不知怎麽着，膽子就小了，也許是在夾道裏看到那兩個衛兵，心裹驚嚇的，所以他依然繼續的答着道：出門子半年多了。全師長道：你姑爺幹什麽的？江氏道：當連長的。這四個字送進了全師長的耳朶，却格外的難受，但是他並不能說你的姑爺不該當兵，因之哦了一聲道：他也是軍界裏的。在那裏當連長呢？江氏道：現在開到喜峯口外面去了，快有兩個月没來信了，我們很惦記的。口子外頭，現在很平靖嗎？師長。全師長聽了這話，便站了起來，問道：你知道開到口子外什麽地方？他說時兩隻眼睛，很向江氏臉上注意着。江氏道：這倒知道，他是駐在平安堡。全師長猛然又向椅子上坐着，同時，他臉上的顔色，有些白裏變紅，問道：你姑爺呌什麽名字？江氏道：他呌趙自强，將來師長提㧞提㧞他罷。（四四三）</p>

<h3 id="c203">清代的上海藏書家 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>前回我們談老上海的藏書家時，曾發出預約券，說是還有清代著名的藏書家要在「下本」裏出現。現在我們就讓這張預約券兌現了。</p>
<p>清代的學術是籠罩在考據學的大氣之下，所以清代的藏書家亦多帶有考古的氣味，校核經史，考索金石，和宋明時代的藏書家風尚有所不同，而上海亦不是例外。</p>
<p>李筠嘉，字脩林，號筍香，嘉道時人。這時正是清代學術的日中時代，李氏也能追蹤媲美時賢。他把邑治東明代朱察卿的慈雲樓故宅購得，收書六千餘種，藏於其中。道光六年，龔目珍給他的藏書志做序，說「上海李氏藏書至四千七百餘種，論議臚注至三十九萬言。承平之風烈，與鄞范氏，歙汪氏，杭州吳氏鮑氏相輝映於八九十年之間。」拿天乙閣振綺堂瓶花齋知不足齋合慈雲樓放在一起講，可見當日的氣槪自是籠蓋海隅的。</p>
<p>說到李氏的藏書志，又令人佩服他治學之精了。他是能够藏書又是能够讀書的，故嘗輯所藏書爲目錄八卷，且筆記讀書的心得在裏面。他嘗說；惠　著的易大誼，用中庸來解釋周易，這不是漢學家應有態度；江聲著的尚書集汪音疏一槪把今字改寫做古體字，眞有點泥古不化。這些意見，人家都認爲是很凖確的。</p>
<p>李筠嘉的孫子名鍾慶，工詩，收藏的書畫有許多佳本，如小李將軍春江圖，山谷老人書千字文，張擇端清明上冡圖詩卷，都是從來少見的東西。喬重禧輓筠嘉詩注說「君身後藏書盡散」，這還是他的兒子不行呢，還是他去世時兒子太小了呢，不可得知，咸同之間，甘泉鄉人著的暴書雜記，說李筍香舊藏的金刻孔氏祖庭廣記，爲同時人馬笏齋所得。</p>
<p>梅益徵，字復齋。他性情愛書，遇有善本，手自讐校。積數十年，成得一閣藏書志四十二卷。他和李筠嘉是同時人，但是没有李氏著名。</p>
<p>說到清代的藏書史，總離不了蘇州府的關係。因爲在明末清初，所有宋元舊本書籍，差不多都歸了錢謙益毛子晋二家，由二家散至季振宜，復歸於黃蕘圃，再歸於汪閬源，總是没有越出吳「門」。但是汪閬源的藏書分散時，却有一部份流入滬凟而爲郁泰峰所得。泰峰名松年，字萬枝，道光二十五年恩貢生。松年饒於財，好讀書，時値太平軍規復江南，吳中藏書盡散，上海因在軍事區域外，郁氏乃乘此機會保存了許多舊版書。但是他的藏書，不久就散了，大部份爲丁日昌所得。後丁氏書散，又有一部份流歸上海涵芬樓（就是後來的東方圖書館。）</p>
<p>和郁松年同時的徐渭仁，也是一位大收藏家，又是一位金石家。他字文臺，號紫珊。鑒别碑帖，時人推爲巨眼。他嘗得到隋開皇時董美人碑，這是非常珍異的古刻，因此他自號「隋軒」。</p>
<p>隋軒很留意搜集本地的文獻，孤本嘉靖上海縣志和極難得的萬歷上海縣志，均曾暫寓於徐家。（萬歷志上有「曾爲徐紫珊所藏」朱文長印）現在「嘉志」已由傳眞社影石流通，「萬志」則藏於徐匯藏書樓。</p>
<p>過了這個時代，讓我們注意的是集團文化的圖書館了。而我們回憶那往昔時代之個人精力的雄偉，自是要表示敬意的。</p>

<p>該校完成新校舍後、又能於艱苦中籌欵萬餘元、增加實用美術科之設備、校董會曁學校當局之努力、殊堪嘉尚、惟原有經常費甚少、僅能維持現狀、以致無力發展校務、今後應積極　籌經費、擴充設備、提高敎員待遇、多聘優良專門人才並增加專科學額、以謀該校之發展、會計仍用舊式賑本、殊欠明瞭、應改用新式簿記、此外招生時並須切實注意入學資格、以上各節、應即轉飭遵照、至公私立藝術專校應設實用藝術課程、曾經本部通令飭遵有案、該校加設實用美術科、並有相當設備、辦理尚屬切實、蘇州爲我國手工業中心之一、近以受工業競爭影響、致有一蹶不振之勢、省方倘能利用該校實用美術科之設備、合辦一實用藝術職業學校、當於地方手工業有所補救、</p>

<h3 id="c245">文學洩悶論（上） <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 陳友琴</p>
<p>有悶自然是洩出爲快·人不可以無悶，悶不可以無洩，幾乎是人同此心心同此理了。因爲心應該到門外兜兜圈子，老關在門内，不是路道。可是洩悶雖人人有願，方法之巧妙，實各各不同。天下最善洩悶者，莫如文人：最不善於洩悶者，莫如愚人，因愚人之「駡喪門」，其方法不足以「語乎巧「妙」也。（有人譯Humour爲「語妙」）</p>
<p>廚川白村以爲文學是「苦悶的象徵」，我以爲苦悶必須洩出，亦屬文學的要義。普通文人之洩悶法有四，而「駡喪門」不與焉。焦大把大觀園裏的醜態和盤托出來，究意不是聰明的辦法。文人們旣不能學易經上所說的「遁世無悶」，因此，看在眼裏，悶在心裏，不得不設法洩出，洩之之法，旣須開開脾胃，又須悅悅耳目，此幽默文學之所以風行當世也。我根本不懂幽默是什麽東西，而愛談談文人的洩悶法。所謂洩悶法有四者何也？一曰諷喻，二曰含蓄，三曰冷雋，四曰憤激。</p>
<p>現在先談第一個洩悶法，諷喻。孔子說：「諫有五，吾從其諷。」口頭須有所諫諍，必心頭已有所苦悶，要洩其悶，不可直率，不可粗魯，最好能從諷喻入手。詩人借碩鼠食黍苗，以諷國君重歛。朱虚侯耕田歌，以「非其種者鋤而去之」的話頭，隱喻芟除異姓。曹子建七步詩，拿「煮豆燃箕」的比喻，諷勸他的老兄，不必相逼。若夫嫌惡某人，不必面斥，而以塵拂蠅曰：「適從何來？遽集於此！」這些例子在世說新語裏可以找出來的更多。其他若莊孟文章，伊索寓言，以及柳子厚三戒之類，莫非諷喻中的好例，足爲洩悶法之冠軍。</p>
<p>第二是含蓄：含蓄的作用，是要聽的人索想一下才能吸白的。他的悶，是不洩之洩，不洩之洩，最爲有味。最善於用含蓄法洩悶的，有詞人之詞爲證。</p>
<p>『少年不識愁滋味，愛上層樓，愛上層樓，爲賦新詩强說愁。</p>
<p>而今識盡愁滋味，欲說還休，欲說還休，却道：「天凉好箇秋！』</p>
<p>好一個「却道天凉好箇秋！」當「欲說還休」之後，有無限的苦悶在隱忍着，雖然只說「天凉好箇秋」五字，人家却已知道他有了滿滿一腹的牢騷了，這豈不是不洩之洩嗎？司空圖所謂「不着一字，盡得風流。語不涉已，苦不堪憂」者是也。孔子說：「予欲無言。」佛云：「不可說丨不可說丨」老子所稱：「不可道，不可名，」都只是這一個道理！（注意，我並非唱儒釋道三家合一論的）</p>
<p>後世文人，能得這含蓄洩悶法者並不多，唐人之詩，若陳子昻「前不見古人，後不見來者，念天地之悠悠，獨愴然而涕下，」寥寥廿二字，所以爲古今來「懐古」詩第一絕唱者，只因爲着墨無多，有含蓄之趣。你試想一想他那包羅萬古牢愁於一胸的氣槪，輕輕發出，竟成爲洩天下之大悶的佳作了。李白「美人捲珠簾，深坐顰娥眉，但見淚痕濕，不知心恨誰。」未曾和盤托出美人的心事。只是寫出了一個疑問，却又已成爲千古「閨怨」的絕唱了。上品文學的消息，便可於此中探得，不在乎嘮嘮叨叨地說上一大氣的廢話。</p>
<p>還有一個妙例，見之於某說部内，也是爲女兒洩悶氣的。青春出嫁不久，丈夫便出遠門，她自道其歷年經過云：「十八嫁郎君，十九郎君出，二十不歸來，今年二十一丨」並没有像現在青年詩人們所說的什麽「青春之慾火啊，燃燒起來了，一顆愛的心泉關不住了」等等正面描寫的肉麻話，然而内含的意思够你玩味了，不說悶，而悶自然洩出來。豈不比洩出悶反而使人不覺其悶的爲佳麽？</p>
<h3 id="c246">政治家之新思想 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 伯韓</p>
<p>汎太平洋佛敎大會的會議席上，已表現了中日「滿」的提携了。</p>
<p>在旱災臨頭的呼救聲中，中國的佛敎徒和張天師出來大顯神通。在匪災威脅直後的湘粤等省，孔敎的復興又是閙得很起勁。</p>
<p>遍地埋着炸藥的太平洋岸，這個年頭兒倒是宗敎家頂出風頭。</p>
<p>據說政治家之間，從前以國家與宗敎分離爲一時的進步思想，但是近來却不知爲什麽，以政敎分離爲舊思想，反而要把政治和宗敎結合起來。不僅如此，連敎育和宗敎也不要如從前一樣的隔别了。</p>
<p>他們自已的解釋是這樣：去年日本齋藤首相及其他閣僚在佛敎聯合會的招待席上說：「安定人心善導思想之事，唯宗敎家是賴。」又，前日本宗敎大會時文相曾演說道：「現代世界共患的社會不安，怎樣可以除去呢？其來由雖然複雜，追根溯源，物質偏重之風，實爲其根柢。凡百社會施設，雖不失爲對症療法，以言根治的對策，首屈一指的不得不算物質主義之克服，而物質主義之克服，只有希望精神主義之高調……精神主義高調究極之點，不得不俟諸宗敎之力。」（見改造本年五月號）</p>
<p>中國的宗敎提倡者也有同樣的見地吧，這個自不必說。新時代的思想總應當一樣的新了。</p>
<p>總之，以東方的精神主義戰勝西方物質主義的話，是很古老的，又很時興的了。謹祝精神主義的勝利！丨丨因爲精神主義的勝利是東方的，而我們屬於東方呵！</p>
<p>但有一個疑問：日本帝國主義在滿洲所要的是精神主義的勝利呢，物質主義的勝利呢？</p>
<p>是的，對於他們那種卑俗的物質主義的追求，我們也只有高調着精神主義去克服他了！</p>
<p>親愛的菲小姐，我來敎你跳跳蝇吧。</p>

<h3 id="c247">猛人論 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>廣東土語的「猛人」，是指百萬富翁，或擁有若干大兵的人而言的。</p>
<p>但據稍有思想的人看，猛人之猛，却剛剛是其軟如綿。猛的意義是剛强，勇武，雄健。富翁軍閥之流，是缺乏這種德性的。没有一個富翁不愛錢，没有一個軍閥不怕死。猛乎哉？不猛也！</p>
<p>那麽怎樣方算猛人呢？</p>
<p>猛人大槪有一個偉大的靈魂，一種堅强的德性，寄寓在一種健康的身體里。再細細將這人格分析起來，又可得到幾種特點：</p>
<p>靈魂之偉大處，在乎澄澈，或係天賦，或係痛苦中磨洗而成，最好的譬喻是「光」，圓定發明，無幽不燭。一切世間的鬼祟，一目了然，無論何種鉤距，試探，不能　透這靈魂的底藴，雖然這時見澄澈，然莫識其際。</p>
<p>因此便視空間時間如無物了。旣不以生爲樂，以死爲苦，也不求生如渴，視死如歸。以百年爲一瞬，却能堅忍使盡形壽，視百年猶百年。而對於華屋邱山，無分軒輊，富貴貧賤，皆若等閒。</p>
<p>然則空生死，空世法之後，豈不好像逍遙自在，無我無人了麽？也不然。雖視所謂今之猛人猶小兒，然不渴血，不飲人類的血汗和眼涙。而悲憫一切在現世受着金錢和名譽支配的愚夫，替他們謀將來，解除其靈魂和形質的痛苦</p>
<p>用這種尺度估量古今中外的所謂偉人，名人，可以得到新的了解。</p>

<p>— 濟羣</p>
<p>大約是中夜的時分吧，因爲睡不着覺，從臥床上爬下來，打開窗門，看看窗外的夜景。</p>
<p>天上不但没有月亮，就星兒一顆也找不出來，窗外只有一種陰森黑漆的夜色。</p>
<p>就在這樣可怕的夜色裏，我聽過了小鳥兒呼救的哀聲，和狠惡的梟鳥的暴呌之後，空氣就死寂得眞是怕人，雞不啼狗不吠，一切的昆虫們，也好像爲了那恐怖的陰森黑漆的夜色，壓抑得不敢聲響，不敢喘息似的。</p>
<p>這時候丨看得見的，只有那禽不禽，獸不獸的蝙蝠的影子，才敢大膽地，在墻角簷邊，得意地，傲慢地飛來飛去。</p>
<p>『哦哦！這是二十世紀的世界的縮影呀！』</p>
<p>我羞惡那騎墻的傲慢的蝙蝠的醜態，憎恨那狠惡的梟鳥的聲音。</p>

<p>— 吕紹光</p>
<p>麥子快黃的時節，失業的皮鞭，我迫我回到闊别了十年的故鄉，飄淪慣了的心情，在默默的沉思里，掀起了無限的悵惘！村口的觀音廟，不再浮起嫋嫋的鐘響，往昔香火的榮華，隨着飢荒的波瀾而消失；彎曲的碎石子的街道，展覽着一堆堆的牛糞，猪屎，垃圾，入夜的鄉村，靜寂得怕人，更夫的木梆聲，寥寥的像是窮困者内心的悸動·荒郊遠處，隱隱的有村婦招魂，悽切的音流，懐着恐懼以消沉！童年時代的遊伴，如今都感得生活的奇緊，見面時誰也無心提起過去的歡笑，眼前的苦痛已足够挨熬，㗒，，闊别了十年的故鄉，引起了我一串串人事的傷感！</p>

<p>加拿大和美國間的界綫，長到三千多哩。如果世界上有太平而合於理想的國界，這一條三千英里的界綫，要算第一了。百多年來，界綫兩邊，没有發生過什麽衝突，而界綫上面，也毫無防禦工程的設立。美國和加拿大在地理上本來是天生一片的。在幾十年以前，美國方面的野心家，往往有用武力或外交力來併呑加拿大的企圖。到了現在，這種計劃已很少談起。六十年來的貨物交換，經濟合作，和人民往來，已使加拿大在事實上成爲美國的一部份。在形式上，加拿大掛的是英國旗，在經濟上，他們用的是美國貨，讀的是美國報紙和雜誌，流行的是美國的習慣和風氣。英國在加拿大的勢力漸漸的由美國代替。固然英國的保守黨和加拿大的親英派，從哇太華會議以後，曾用勉强的辦法，來增加加拿大和英國間互相的依賴的關係，但是從倫敦到蒙太利爾要一週以上的航程，而紐約到蒙太利爾幾個鐘頭便够。住在這迢迢三千多哩的界綫上面的加拿大人民，往往站在門口便可以和界綫以南的美國境内住民互相招呼。這種關係，使加拿大人覺得華盛頓比之於倫敦，更其密切而親近些。</p>
<p>就商業方面說，加拿大是美國最大的市塲。在過去一年内，總數僅一千萬的加拿大人口，消費了値二萬萬三千二百萬美金的美國貨。同時美國是加拿大貨物的大主顧。去年一年美國人買了値一萬萬八千四百萬美金的加拿大貨。而且二國的經濟關係，更因投資而加密。在加拿大，現在有四十一萬萬的美國資本，而英國人在加拿大的資本只有二十二萬萬。</p>
<p>在交通及運輸方面，加拿大和美國的互相依賴，更其明顯。做加拿大國命脈的兩條大鐵路（CPR和CNR）其所運的貨物，所載的客人，常常是從美國來的。尤其是昌興公司即（C·PR·）開往遠東的輪船，大部份做的是美國人的生意。該公司的分局，設徧了美國較大的城市。公司的股票，分屬於加拿大，美國，和英國的人的。公司的營業，許多是由美國人辦理的，昌興公司的宣傳伎倆，是非常出名的。每年多少美國遊客，送錢到加拿大去，大半是這家公司宣傳的結果。不過宣傳也要有實際的價値做基礎的。昌興公司的火車，旅館，和輪船，的確比美國平均的清潔一些，整齊一些。而加拿大人所經營的風景區域也比美國要高明些。</p>

<h3 id="c275">祈雨得雨 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>最近一個月來，各處都閙着旱荒。江浙各地，差不多已有一個多月没有下雨了。前數日雖下過幾陣雨，卽使無濟於事，也可說有求必應了，</p>
<p>旱荒，旱荒，各處都閙着旱荒。跟着旱荒而來的，則是各處的迎神與設壇求雨。特别在上海，至前日止，統計爲着求雨而設的大道塲，已有五六處以上了。這都是一些名流們所主持的。其他不聞名的求雨會，我想一定還很多。這許多的道塲，大家都在很誠懇的禱告求雨，希望以至誠之心，上格蒼穹，大沛甘霖，不獨中國如此，連以科學物質文明見長的美國，現在也在實行禁屠求雨了。這不能不說是一回怪事。</p>
<p>然而其實也並無可怪。因近代工業發達而發達的近代資本主義文明，至今日，已至宣告破產的時候，資本主義的毀滅，使建築於這個資本主義上的一切意識形態，也不能不發生動搖。資本主義文明發生動搖，他不得不回到古老的宗敎的家庭中去，要求宗敎帮忙，給他以神秘的外衣，宗敎本是資本主義文明所極力反對的，然而這是在資本主義壯年期的話，現在資本主義已經老弱了，他不得不需要宗敎帮忙。没有宗敎帮忙，他實在不能再苟延殘喘。這才是祈神求雨所以今日也盛於美國的一個原因。語云「人窮呼天，疾痛呼父母，」這是無聊辦法中的一個辦法。</p>
<p>至於中國的求雨，雖是幾千年傳下來的老法，然在前幾年，也顯然已見不行了。各處廟堂前幾年不斷的被人搗毁，便是其一例證。而到最近，這神道設敎也者，又重新復活起來。如什麽法會，迎神賽會的復活，以及最近的各處求雨等，都花樣翻新，變成了近年社會文化運動之一。這不是没有意義的。這意義雖與資本主義文明利用宗敎有程度上的不同，但其本質，却無甚差别。這才是中國近年所以迷信之事特别反盛的一個理由與由來。</p>
<p>歷史上突變的事實，一天接近一天。因之，一切反科學的理想。也一天繁盛一夫。但這反科學的理想。最後一定還是阻止不了科學的進展，這是毫無疑義的，莫謂求雨得雨，神靈有無上的權威呢，</p>
<h3 id="c276">逃暑 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 非</p>
<p>天氣眞熱呵！太陽是那麽毒辣辣底：可眞吃不消啦，大家一夥兒避暑去吧！</p>
<p>是的，天熱了，避暑去：青島底嶗山，杭州底莫干山，江西底廬山，牯嶺，南海底普陀等處，都是著名底避暑勝地，那裏有底是要人們底足跡和紳士們底行踪。</p>
<p>避暑去，這，祇有一般高貴底人們和資產階級者，才有享受底特權。終日爲生活壓迫着底勞苦大衆們是没有這個份兒的，尤其是像吾這樣底一個食不能飽，衣不能暖底窮小子，休想有此機會！</p>
<p>熱是大衆的，不過，有少數有錢階級和達官顯宦當然例外：便是吾，也是同樣底怕熱。眼睜睜底看着人家，大夥兒底避暑去，大夥兒底住冷氣房間去，自已却不免有些眼紅。所以，便對天發下了個洪誓大願，咬咬緊牙根，也要想去嘗試一回避暑底滋味。上廬山，莫干山，却没有這種資格：窮小子一年底汗血，還抵不够避一個月暑用的；這種不合　輯底夢想，所以始終也不會有實現的可能。夢想到永久底將來，依舊是一個夢想！</p>
<p>那麽，吾昨準備上那兒去呢？這問題儘在吾腦海裏盤旋着。結果，終於經了幾日夜底思量，還是决定跑到鄉村裏去逃暑，在鄉村裏底夏天，也許要比較都市裏好過些，那裏有幽靜底環境和清新底空氣。却没有都市裏的煩囂塵俗與誘人聲色。</p>
<p>現在，吾已經暫時脫離了都市裏生活，而避到了大人先生們所不願到底農村裏來過夏，等這夏天走了，吾再回到都市裏來。在那裏，吾很想寫一些鄉村生活底雜拾：也許，在這雜拾裏，吾可告訴一些稀奇底故事，和平凡底消息給都市裏底人們。再會吧！都市裏底人們啊！吾祝福你們永恒地呷着那粉紅色底美酒。</p>
<p>當吾回到農村裏才兩天，而友人沈君履平便寫了一封信來給吾，他信中是這樣說：</p>
<p>「霞飛：山居樂乎？余自來申，倐已兩來復，然於黑甜鄉中，猶時時懷念石公也。壁上所題，俟至明年碧桃着花時，當再與君靡娑之耳。</p>
<p>深居林泉，無車馬喧，有山水樂，俗慮旣滌，胸襟豁然，此母怪君常羡鄉村而厭惡都市矣。所恨吾儕，饑來驅迫，不能自已，栗碌終日，依人作嫁，欲享此人間清福而終不可得。……」（今年春，吾曾和他同遊石公，他底文章曾在時事新報「新上海」中發表，這次吾返鄉，剛巧他來上海才二星期。）</p>
<p>的確，日嬉羣兒，晚臥南窗，無事三盃酒，閑誦古人詩，此情此境，眞是雖羲皇上人亦不啻。吾想都市裏底羣衆是，享不到這種清福的。</p>
<p>在鄉村裏底生活是有規定的，甚至，也可說是機械化的。吾現在到鄉村雖祇短短的三天，而已深深底感到了無上底興味。</p>
<p>於是，日出之前，或斜陽影裏，湖畔，林中，便不時有吾的踪跡出現了。</p>

<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>大約是因我們生在科學最發達的二十世紀，大家誰都多少受過一點兒科學的洗禮，所以對於虔誠祈神消災降福的人，總以爲他是最愚昧不過的吧！我們以科學爲依據去反對迷信鬼神，這當然没有誰敢置齒的；但是，人類畢竟是哲學的產物，人們對於宇宙間的事事物物，總在企求着得個解釋，（不管是神學的，科學的）人們的靈魂，總在需要着得個依歸；就使是個十分明白天地間根本就没有鬼神這東西存在的人，及至走頭無路，而想無門時，也常會想到鬼神這上面來。一個革命領袖，當在失意潦倒，或辦事𣗥手，不能信任自已時，也常會求神問卜，以定吉兇；（據報悉，希特拉最近也曾問過卜來的，）一個科學名家，及至大病臨危，百藥無效時，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>人家爲他祈神保佑，他也稍引爲慰，就是這個道理。</p>
<p>我們中國，誰都知道，對於異敎一向是十分寛容的。許多異敎邪說，在其出生地，尚不能站着脚，一旦輸入中國來，就能到處風行無阻了。人家對此，只認爲中國素來是取了『寛大爲懷』的態度，所以才有這樣的結果；其實，中國人民生活的可憐，也的確是其中的一大原因。</p>
<p>近天來，由於旱熱成災，瘟疫流行的結果，迎神禱視，禁屠祈雨的事，又是到處盛行了。一班臥洋樓，吃大菜的人，看此情形，只在斤斤斥責人們的愚昧無知，深長浩歎着：『中國不亡，豈有此理！但是，眼睜睜看着一田田正在發肥的稻苗，在烈日下乾枯，而又没有什麽方法以供救濟，呌誰個不着急？眼睜睜看着一個個軀體强桿的同伴，在烈日下相繼倒斃，而又没有什麽醫院，肯供收容療治，呌誰個不心慌？假使他們連寄托在鬼神上面的一點兒希望也没有，他們不是一個個坐着急死，就要另換一個樣兒了！</p>

<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>哥哥：</p>
<p>現在我開始悔恨了！我爲什麽要進學校念書呢？我尤其不應該别了慈愛的母親和美麗的故鄉來到這萬惡的都市裏求學啊：</p>
<p>哥哥，我的環境壞透了！在我那一班裏，一共有三十四個人，女的只有五個，那二十九個男同學都像强盜一樣·他們不知道把我們當作什麽人啊！非但本級的同學如此　　别班的同學也都是如此的。尤其是我，他們好像要呑我似的，他們對於我眞殘酷啊！</p>
<p>在開學的幾天，我還能很安心的念書，可是一個星期之後，所有的同學都漸漸地注意起我來了！上課的時候，他們老是望着我，輕輕地談着我：下了課更來得厲害。我没一刻可以逃掉他們那種怕人的眼光。哥哥，我眞怕呀！我再也想不到學校裏會有這樣事的。要是我知道的話，我再也不敢進學校的。</p>
<p>後來，他們不僅用可怕的眼光來注視我了，他們時時在想得到一個機會來和我接近，有時候我掉了一支鉛筆，他們就會搶着替我拾起來，恭敬地遞給我，而且還會朝我笑一笑。（我眞怕他們的笑啊：）在考試的時候，他們會把做好的答案一個個的送到我的面前來，哥哥，這是什麽意思呢，難道他們都不願意我能够靠自已的力量把試題做出來麽。還有，他們並不呌我的名字，也不呌女子或小姐，却呌我做什麽安其兒的。哥哥，什麽呌安其兒呢？你懂嗎。噯，我可眞不知道是怎末一回事啊：</p>
<p>之後，竟有人寫信給我了，用花花綠綠的紙頭寫着很端正的鋼筆字，每封信至少有三張紙頭，有許多話我是看不懂的，大槪都是恭維我的話，而且都是希望我和他們做朋友的。起初我眞不知道怎末辦好，眞的，哥哥，我不是十五歲了嗎，我却從没碰到過這種事啊！後來我以爲做做朋友總是不妨的，所以就給他們一個回信。誰知後來信一天多一天了，每天經過門房，起碼可以拿到十封信。這呌我怎樣辦呢，我總不能一天到晚寫信啊！而且有些信我簡直不願意着，全是什麽我親愛的啊，美麗的小鳥啊，這一類的肉麻話，總於我决定一槪置之不理，無論誰來的信都看也不看地燒掉他。哥哥，這不是一個很好的辦法嗎？誰知道信却越來越多了，有的駡，有的求，有的攻擊……後來他們竟堂皇地在壁報上胡閙起來了。唉，我眞不敢想啊！在我寫這封信的時候，我的手還在抖，我的心還在跳·我的淚却再也忍不住了！</p>
<p>哥哥，你想我怎末能安心的念書呢！現在暑假又到了，可是在這半年裏我究竟得到些什麽呢？唉，我眞是欲哭無淚，欲笑無聲啊！</p>
<p>哥哥，我對於念書的迷夢是打破了，我不希望再進學校了，學校簡直是吃人的魔鬼啊！我寗可在甜蜜的故鄉伴着親愛的母親，再也不願跑到都市裏去看惡魔的巨口了！</p>

<p>— 文丐</p>
<p>文藝作品好比一件衣服，注重思想内容的人他說布要質好的，而且耐穿合身；注重技巧形式的人他說布要美麗的，做法要時髦漂亮。結果是：美麗時髦的衣服，合了一般人的胃口，耐穿不耐穿，人們全不在乎，而注重技巧形式的文藝理論家勝利，氣得注重思想内容的文藝理論家大駡讀者孺子不可敎也。其實，布的質好耐穿而又做法時髦美麗的衣服，兩者都講究，是更加受人歡迎，文藝作品何曾不是一樣？</p>
<p>現在的文藝作家正好比裁縫師傳一樣：爲了生活不得不做衣服。而有的還在粗製濫造偷工减料。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>你是一個社會上的良導師，對於我們有難於解决的問題，你總是用善美而良好的辦法答覆我們，所以我很崇拜你。</p>
<p>現在我有一件難事請求你，請你在最短的期内答覆，事情是這樣的：</p>
<p>我有一個朋友姓王，年在二十歲左右，現在某洋行任練習生職。二月前由友人介紹，認識了一位女友，她姓蔣，現求學於某小，家中有一位白髪的老母，一位哥哥，旁無他人，她的家庭很舊式，但他的頭腦，恰是與她的家庭相反，很善交際。</p>
<p>自從他丨她由友人介紹後，就情投意合，眞有「相見恨晚之槪」。電影院公園等内，常見他丨她的踪跡。</p>
<p>前不多時，她交友的事，被她家中的哥哥知道了，雖然我友没有與她發生過肉體關係，但是她家庭是個舊式的，就提出了下列的話：「要我友允許與她成爲終身大事丨婚姻，不然要賠償名譽等損失」……我友家庭，也是一個舊式的，所以對於他的婚姻也不能自主，並且他目下没有自立的能力，在這進退兩難的時候，懇請先生代爲解决，並將四個疑問寫錄於后：</p>
<p>（一）對於婚姻問題，可否答應？</p>
<p>（二）答應後，如何使家庭允許婚姻要求？</p>
<p>（三）假使不答應後，她家中用法律解决，他有無罪過，及介紹人有否罪？</p>
<p>（四）不答應後，用何種方法仍可與她往來？</p>
<p>以上的疑題，請先生一一詳答，此請順頌</p>
<p>撰安　嚴影敬上</p>
<p>答：婚姻是戀愛的歸宿，所以男女雙方將要走入愛情之途時，預先就要計較一下，將來是否有結婚的可能。如無可能而盲目談愛，最是危險的事。令友事前没有顧慮到自已有無獨立論婚的資格，祇看見自由變愛很時髦，就貿然學樣，到現在誤已誤入，這，我不能不說他是太糊塗了。而且，男女雙方愛情熱烈的時候，必然的要謀結婚，如果結婚有障碍，也一定要用盡全力去克服，决没有聽見人家催他訂婚，反而進退兩難猶豫不决的。由於這一點，我很懷疑令友對於蔣女士的戀愛，恐祗是性愛的追求，而無情愛的誠意。所以，你代他詢問的信，我本想往字紙簏裏一擲置之不理的：尤其是第四問，問得最是豈有此理。但後來一想，令友究竟是個二十歲左右的小孩子，處世經騐尚少，若不指示他一個正當的辦法，讓他自已糊裏糊塗的做去，事體一定越發弄糟，而且，犯着這種毛病的人，恐怕也不在少數。所以特地提出公開答覆。</p>
<p>我覺得令友以後應該趕快照着以下的原則而决定自已的方針：自已先仔細反省和觀察一下，看自已究竟愛不愛某女士，某女士是否是自已理想的配偶，如果是的，就應毫無猶豫，馬上答應，一方面更向家庭疏通，卽使疏通不成，也無妨碍，因爲婚姻是自已的事，成年以後就有權自已决定，無須得家庭同意；如果不是的，以往的關係祗是由性愛發生，那就爽爽快快，從此斷絕，令友與某女士旣無肉體關係，是没有什麽罪過的。但因爲令友做事極不牢靠，所以末後我還要叮囑一句，就是如果自已答應對方，但家庭却不承認時，自已應該時時刻刻的記着將來家庭負擔的責任，從速謀自立的辦法。</p>

<p>— 保加利亞伊凡·瓦卓夫作楊森譯</p>
<p>兩個孩子像是紥在地上似地停留着。過去了好幾個鐘頭。山上吹來的風更加兇狂了；風鞭打着兒童們的面孔，吹動着他們的衣服。在他們的周圍雪繞着大旋地吹動着，但是他們並不畏縮。他們面孔仍然注視着水平綫，希望尋到一個活人。突然琪娜的心臟跳起來了。遠遠地可以望見一隊騎兵跑來了。那有多少兵士啊！大哥哥一定是在裏面的！她不動地等候着。那些人飛馬跑來，喧騷地從孩子們的身邊過去，一直走他們的路。</p>
<p>琪娜對着兩個在隊伍後邊的兵士招手：</p>
<p>「隊長！」她聲音裏含着淚呌着。「我們的哥哥來了麽。」</p>
<p>兩個軍官停住了，驚異地望着她。</p>
<p>「誰是你的哥哥？」一個軍官問</p>
<p>「斯託揚哥哥，我們的斯託揚哥哥，」拉杜喬忍耐不住地大呌着，奇異這個威武的軍官會不曉得斯託揚就是他們的哥哥。</p>
<p>「什麽斯託揚？」軍官問。</p>
<p>「威特倫市的斯託揚，」琪娜斷然地回答。</p>
<p>那個軍官悄聲地對着他的伴侶說了一兩句話，於是有趣地再問：「你們的哥哥是在騎兵隊裏麽？」</p>
<p>「是的，是的，」那是個可憐的孩子回答，她是不理解這句問話的。</p>
<p>「喔，他不和我們一塊兒，我的可憐的孩子。快回家去吧。你們要會凍死在這里的。」另一個軍官說。</p>
<p>於是，拍起刺馬輪，兩個人飛跑趕上了他們的隊伍。</p>
<p>琪娜哭泣着，拉杜喬抱怨着。他們的手足凍得麻木了，他們的嘴唇已經完全没有了感覺。在他們的面前伸展着路，一直到他們的村市，非常荒凉的。那些走來迎接歸家的兵士的人們，現在都回去了。天黑暗下來，風是越加的狂暴。人們只能看見那遠遠地跑去的騎兵隊，兵士們的快樂的歌藉着風力響在這兩個兒童的耳裏。</p>
<p>琪娜和拉杜喬返身回到村裏來。</p>
<p>夜已降落了。手深深地挿在口袋裏，兩個兒童一聲不響地走着，想像着他們的母親等在門口邊的情况。</p>
<p>一輛三匹馬的馬車的聲響，起在他們的身後。</p>
<p>「先生，請問後邊還有兵士麽？」</p>
<p>但是那輛車跑得很快，在黑暗中没有一個人看見他們或是聽到他們。</p>
<p>雪仍然在他們的身邊打旋。這雪是從西方吹來的，從戰塲上吹來的，在戰塲土，在近皮樂的葡萄田上，這雪白喪衣已經遮蓋了斯託揚的墳墓？</p>

<h3 id="c282">一位西部明星改變作風的决心）下 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>湯姆金爲什麽肯甘心聽了一個素昧平生的金維多的話，貿然放棄了紅星的地位，高崇的新俸，並且冒了極大的危險，去接受那種契約，而離開好萊塢呢？這在崇拜金錢丨非但金錢，而是硬幣丨丨的好萊塢，當然是件稀有之事，但是他認爲是對的，他就去做，他的勇敢是可嘉的。况且他經過了一年之後，重新回到好萊塢，他已換了一個新人，帶了一個新作風，已不是從前橫衝直撞的牧塲英雄，而成爲富有表演藝術的演員。這不能不說他以前决策的聰明，因爲西部影片的作風，到底是已到了日薄崦嵫的時候，而他不得不改途易轍而圖自存了</p>
<p>當金維多遇見了他之後，就和他說道：「我現在有一個計劃：要是你肯和我賭博的話，我們可以賭博一下………如果你覺得你的影戲事業，有重新開始的必要。這就是你的機會。你可以和公司商量，將合同買它回來。我可以担保給你在我新片中一個主角的地位。再則，我可以先付給你一個相當的薪水，直到我有了開始製作凖備的時候爲止。」湯姆問道！「那要多少時候呢？」金維多道：「大槪總要一年。在這一年之中，我不管你到什麽地方去，做什麽事，祇要你離開好萊塢，忘記攝影塲。你可以和眞實的男女人們混雜些，將好萊塢的滋味從你口裏淡下去！將好萊塢的思想，從你腦筋裏消了去。第一樣要不想西部影片。亦不要再牽罣合同與金錢。不要怕人家會忘記你。因爲我的意思，是要他們忘記你。你可以學習些表演的技能，登一下子舞台。餘下來，你可以讀讀書，休息休息，快樂快樂。等到時候一到，我會來呌你的。那時你就是我的明星了。」</p>
<p>普通一般的電影明星，呌他們放棄了很穩固的地位，很可靠的前程，很大的薪水，而去就一年的小薪水，开且一年之後，那張片子拍不拍亦在渺茫之中，他們是不幹的。但是湯姆金竟决定了接受金維多的計劃，他在一個月之内，就將和公司訂的合同買了回來，拒絶了一切其他的合同，而悄然向東方去了。他因爲要遠遠離開好萊塢，他一跑跑到極東北角的曼因州的一個小城。那個小城裏有一個暑期戲班。那個戲班是全國舞台明星薈萃之處。他們到了暑期，舞論地位多高，名聲多大，總要到那個地方，和其他各地的明星們聚聚首，大家研究研究，以資觀摩之效的。他們民主精神很深地位無論高下，凡是登台演戲的，一槪支薪水每星期五十元。那個戲班開辦的目的，並不在賺錢，而在設立一個伶人總匯的樞紐而已。湯姆金到了那裏，就加了那個戲班，演習一齣戲，辛勤工作了幾個月之久，後來他離開了那裏，又週遊全國各地，和各種人物接談着，他所住的地方空氣，力求和民衆接近而和好萊塢式的生活遠離。他自已說他亦常常爲他的前途而憂慮，以及常常夜中看着屋頂睡不着覺。他雖信託金維多，但是一年之中，變幻甚多，或者金維多事業失敗，不能踐約；或者他被汽車壓死了，亦就一切都完了。不過後來一年剛到，金維多來電報，呌他去開始工作，那就是他生平最痛快的一件事了。</p>
<p>至於他爲什麽肯下這種决心，接受金維多的主張，他亦有他的道理。以下是他自已所發表的談話：「在金維多没有和我接洽之前，我已早懷着脫離好萊塢的意思。金維多不過替我定了决策。我相信要是一個人發現了他走的不是一條正途，他就應當抱着大無畏的精神，犠牲一切去改正它。當然，那總是要放棄一件穩固的東西，而去孤注一擲和未來賭博的。我並不是說，離開一件穩固的地位，是毫無痛苦的。我當時實在覺得其痛苦好似拔牙；但牙蛀了，誰能不忍痛將它拔去呢？那時我的西部影片，雖然仍在盛行的時候，我總覺得那是前途茫茫，毫無把握的。至於各公司方面，對於這種西部影片，亦祇認爲暫時可以增加些收入的工具。它們對於西部影片的主角，雖然很優容，但是它們從來没有費過心思金錢去培植他們。它們亦不過等候着時間，讓他們自已受淘汰罷了。」</p>
<p>金維多遇見湯姆的時候，他剛完成了第十三張片子。但因爲他覺悟到他走的路，不是一條正路，所以他就毅然决然地决定了要萬事更始一下，而金維多的計劃，不過促成了他的志願而已。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c283">評「月缺花殘」 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Mandalay丨南京丨</p>
<p>關於這一影片，我覺得除了凱茀蘭茜絲演得很好之外，其他是没有什麽用得着我們特别提出的。</p>
<p>凱茀蘭茜絲的確是一個極優秀的演員。我們看過她所主演的片子很多，最近從「未了塵緣」到「浮生若夢」，她飾着傷感的悲劇的主人公，當是深刻的抓住了觀衆脆弱的同情。特别是在「浮生若夢」）ThoHouseonthstreet（之中，她因自已一生之不幸的經歷，而犧牲自已的一切，愛護自已所遺棄了的女兒更因爲那故事是羅曼迪克的，帮助了她在演技上可愛的成功。</p>
<p>現在，這一「月缺花殘」又同樣是攫取她傷感的個性。劇作者使她從國破家亡中逃出來，復被心愛的男人所丢棄，她只得出賣肉體，其間雖然又遇知已，但只是一個酒徒，然而到最後，畢竟是傷心人同病相憐了，當她殺害了那一個負心人之後。就在這過程中，她是深刻的，逼眞的表現了出來，這，我們在很小的地方得着證明的：如她在船上已走入隔壁的湯尼房中之後，保登醫生來敲門，她開門接見時，一般的說似乎應當佯作喜態，然而後却仍是很冷靜的，以表現她内心的悲痛。從這些地方，可以看出她對於劇中人個性之體念，雖然這中間更包含的導演的主要成份在内。此外她獨自一人在船頭眺望，清靜的夜色，使她覺着悲哀，當她在酒吧間看見那醫生又在放肆喝酒的時候，她祇得暗暗的搖頭嘆息，這正充分的證明了她對於傷感塲面，却是演得怡到好處。</p>
<p>然而這一塲戲，那靜的悲哀却給導演在調子上破壞了的，原因是這般頭夜眺到酒吧間門前爲止，其中是將湯尼設計逃遁夾雜着同時描寫的：這一方面是比較緊張的調子，其無形中便將靜的悲哀破壞了。這無論如何是導演不够把握的地方。</p>
<p>一般的說，導演的手法並不是怎樣十分高明的。我們固然不能指出更多的錯誤，但是也祇是不怎樣失職而已。一般的美國導演，都是在攝影塲中想像東方的景物，而這裏所描寫的緬甸風光，也是和一般的描寫中國一樣，用一種珍奇而帶侮辱的眼光，非眞實的欺瞞觀衆，這在那夜總會中，充份的表現出來。在美國片中總不至於缺少夜總會的塲面，而這裏穿挿着清末民初的繡花衣的女人，又在中國觀衆前出現了。這些地方，不够眞實的描寫，總該是藝術作品的損失，而附帶的說明導演之淺薄吧。導演的聰明，僅限於個别的塲面之細膩的處理，對於鏡頭的角度，或是對於演員的指導，都很可取，可是對於其他更重要的方面，没有充實的把握，始終不能成爲一個極優秀的導演。不過，話得說回頭，這樣頽廢的羅曼斯，就是再導演得好些，也不見得爲一般積極的觀衆所需要吧。</p>
<p>大略的故事，已如前述，編劇在選擇題材以至於題材的處理，都表現出他對於現實的認識十分淺薄。他在寫湯尼的時候，似乎要觀衆咒咀他的用情不專，於是附帶的說及他在販賣軍火；這好像暴露了帝國主義者在殖民地的陰謀，但是我們得了解這完全是下意識的採取了這一素材以作爲湯尼之行爲不端的描寫，和以後寫那警官的勳章掛在妓女的吊襪帶上一樣，所謂暴露警察的罪惡，也不過爲了警察之放逐那妓女之不當。而警官的面子，可以用一萬元購買回來。湯尼被黛亞毒殺臨死的當時，居然良心發現而跳海，而不作死前的掙扎，這種非現實的羅曼斯的大情人，使觀衆大爲同情了；品行雖是不端，但良心到底是好的。如此矛盾的表現，已是一般美國電影作家的通病，而本劇的作者，也是不能例外。</p>
<p>有一點，應當作爲劇作者之優點而提出的，那便是黛亞隨手打碎了湯尼的照相架，更因他而受微傷，於是少年醫生來給她醫治了創傷，以象徵她們之間的命運，這雖然是老的手法，然而多少是還可取的了。</p>

<p>— 文蔭</p>
<p>麗蓮又怪呌道：「不朽？」她剛纔一時的興奮又消失了。她說道：「我還是死而朽的好。我需要的是一個負責的經理人。馬克斯·雅各就要在克利夫蘭上車了。我就要和他簽訂合同的。」這雅各的名字，使吉甫太難堪了。那是他從前的一個僕役，現在竟做起成功的製作家了！字　，他不禁喊道；「馬克斯·雅各。他是個竊賊！他是目不識丁的妄人！他連自已的名都寫不出來的」。麗蓮狂笑道：他在支票上，倒寫得很好的，還是很大的支票哩！」吉甫怒吼道：「哦，原來你祗要錢！」他搖着頭作夷然不屑的神氣道！「你變了，變了一個惟利是圖的人。不過你要錢，我亦可以給你。有一位克拉克先生，他是一位藥餅大王，他已經答應擔負經濟全責，並且是没有限制的！」他說着奔了出去，向對門喊着奥麥萊道：「奥麥萊，拿那張合同來。</p>
<p>那個合同太好了，麗蓮疑信參半的讀着。她微笑了。簽合同時先付一萬元……特别化妝室，全部用素，白絲絨裱糊的……一輛新汽車，一個車夫，一個侍女，一個書記，還有其他一切，眞是筆不勝述，亦有在理想之内的，亦有在理想之外的。奥麥萊指着一點一點的地方道！「瓊漿在那裏流了，快在這裏簽字吧。」他笑着將自來水筆遞給麗蓮，又說道！「這簡捷不是什麽簽訂合同，而是行加冕禮了。整箱的寳石，厚厚的地氈，襯托着你的美麗的脚，大理石的澡盆，成羣的奴僕，靜待你的呼喚。」但是麗蓮還是遲疑着，並且遲疑得太久了。外面過道中，突然發生了一種極大的衝動。那時火車剛剛進了克利夫蘭的車站，那個所謂百萬富翁的克拉克先生，看見了他的姪子來接他，突然間又瘋狂大作起來了。車上的那個車守在克拉克的後面，架着推着呌他下車、吉甫走出去一看，不覺狂怒道：「你們這算什麽？這是克拉克先生，從前的藥餅大王。」那車守說道：「别的我不知道，我祗知道他是瘋子。」麗蓮聽了，她面上露出極度驚慌的神色，她知道她又受騙了。不過那車守看見她那副驚慌失措的神氣，連忙解釋道：「加蘭小姐，你不用害怕。他是一些危險没有的：…他是怪可憐的。他們將他關在瘋人院裏，關了一年多，但是他逃了出來。」那瘋子突然將車守的乎搖開了。他拚命在過道裏向前奔。車守和克拉克的姪子，和許多侍役就緊緊在後追着。麗蓮退進自已的屋子裏，將門砰的一關，惡狠狠地對着吉甫道：「這是我和你說話的最後一次了。你這樣侮辱我，我所從來没有受過的！」吉甫央告道：「我的愛，你請聽我的話。我亦是上人家的當呀。」麗蓮掉轉身不理睬他。這時馬克斯·雅各已經上車來見她。她看見了他就歡然地呌喊了起來。她喊的是一種親暱的稱呼：「馬克西，馬克斯，我的天上安琪兒，我的寳貝！」一連呌了一大串。馬克斯說道：「我已經替你定好了蘇末爾散穆漢的戲。我的寳貝，我們明天一下車，就要直接到律師那裏去簽訂合同約。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">According to Reports, Dalian Talks Very Successful, Chai Shan Arrived in Tianjin Last Night from Dalian <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Yin Tong arrived in Qingdao on the Dalian Maru at 7:30 AM on the 26th. He went to the residence of Wang Yangxian of the Bank of China for breakfast. Reporters sent in cards to interview Yin, but Wang's servant replied that Yin had not arrived. The reporters then went to the ship. Yin was in first-class cabin number one. At 11:57 AM, Yin and Wang Yangxian, along with four others, finally arrived at the ship. As it was about to depart, they only spoke for three minutes near the gangway. Yin was still hesitant and unwilling to speak directly, only saying that the Dalian meeting this time was a temporary and simple affair. Our side only had one person left. The issues raised, such as the abolition of the Tanggu Truce and the security of the war zone, were all very successful. However, the details are very numerous and still require meetings at any time for discussion. The Tanggu Truce should be abolished, but the time has not yet arrived. The Security Forces can continue to enter the war zone. The postal issue was not mentioned. After arriving in Shanghai, I will immediately go to Mogan Mountain to visit Huang, and Huang can return north immediately. It is undecided whether he will go to Beijing. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Dalian meeting ended yesterday. Kwantung Army representatives Okamura and Kita have both returned to Changchun to report to Chief of Staff Owaki. Military Attaché Chai Shan of the Japanese Embassy returned to Beiping on the Changping Maru yesterday. It is estimated that he will arrive in Tanggu today. When passing through Tianjin, he will meet with Commander of the Garrison Army Umezu. He is scheduled to return to Beiping on the morning of the 29th. As a result of this Dalian meeting, a decision was made on various outstanding issues in the war zone. After Yin returns to Tianjin to report to the authorities, a formal meeting of the war zone will be convened for discussion. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chai Shan arrived in Tianjin at 7 PM this afternoon on the Changping Maru and is staying at the Tokiwa Inn in the Japanese Concession. He is scheduled to return to Beiping by military plane early on the 27th. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e2">All Puppet Police Along the Great Wall Withdrawn <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Caojia Road Taken Over by Our Side</p>
<p>Sub-stations Established One After Another</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of withdrawing puppet police from all locations along the Great Wall has reportedly been completely resolved. The puppet police at Nantianmen have been withdrawn to outside the pass. The Gubeikou Zuo Zhi Bureau has dispatched Director Ruan Wenying and others to lead the police there on June 25th to implement the takeover. Sub-stations have been established one after another recently to manage everything. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Issue of Setting Up Tax Stations Along the Great Wall <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Personnel and Methods Already Determined Internally</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has dispatched Zhang Yongnian, Deputy Commissioner of the Tianjin Customs, to Beiping to prepare for the establishment of tax stations at the five passes of the Great Wall. He has already completed inspections in places such as Gubeikou. Zhang returned to Beiping to discuss with Yin Rugeng and others. According to the Ministry of Finance: 1. This time, the establishment of tax stations along the Great Wall in North China has been approved by the Ministry of Finance after being submitted by the Commissioner of the Tianjin Customs through the Director-General of Customs. In the future, the overall planning and arrangements will be managed by the Director-General of Customs and reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation at any time. As for the date of establishment, it will be realized as soon as the Commissioner's report reaches the Ministry. 2. The rumor that the Japanese side has expressed opposition to the establishment of tax stations by our Ministry of Finance at the Great Wall is inaccurate. Setting up tax stations is to prevent smuggling, and the Japanese side has no reason to object. Therefore, there are no difficulties in the implementation. 3. After the establishment of tax stations at the five passes of the Great Wall, they will still be under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Customs. No separate tax agency will be established in Beiping. However, Zhang Yongnian, Deputy Commissioner of the Tianjin Customs, will temporarily remain in Beiping to oversee everything. 4. This time, the Ministry of Finance is reorganizing tax stations in various places to prevent smuggling, not only in North China. Even in South China, such as the Fujian and Guangdong provinces, there are also mutual increases. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Yongnian said that after inspecting Gubeikou, there are already clues about setting up stations at various passes along the Great Wall. The Gubeikou sub-station will be established as a priority. A general office is also planned to be established in Beiping. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Yongnian and Gao Yuanji, because Xifengkou, Lengkou, Jieling and Jiumen passes are all within the Luanyu area, will go to Tangshan in the next few days to visit Tao Shangming for contact. After the matter is completed, they will return to Beiping. The tax police for the Gubeikou sub-station will be selected from a dozen or so members of the Second Security Brigade stationed in Miyun to serve. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Yongnian and Gao Yuanji have completed the preparations for establishing customs at various passes and are only waiting for Yin Tong to return to discuss the date of implementation. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has internally determined the methods and personnel for establishing various sub-stations at the Great Wall, and they will be established soon. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese garrison in Tianjin has again scheduled street fighting exercises for the morning of the 27th. A total of three companies of infantry will participate. There will be four exercises, each lasting one hour. The first time will be from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM, located on Penglai Street, with the main force on Matsushima Street and the Akiyama Street as flanking forces. The second time will be from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, with the main force on Matsushima Street and the flanks on Penglai Street and Naniwa Street. The third time will be from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, with the main force on Miyajima Street and the flanks on Naniwa Street and Fushimi Street. The fourth time will be from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, with the main force on Fushimi Street and the flanks on Miyajima Street and Fukushima Street. Martial law will be imposed during the exercises and traffic will be cut off. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Puppet Organization Plans to Increase Import Tax Rates <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The puppet organization revised its tariffs on the first of this month and plans to increase import tax rates next month. After this news spread, it attracted the attention of officials and businessmen from various countries. According to diplomatic sources, our side is observing the development of this matter and closely monitoring various countries. However, the so-called "open door policy" of the Japanese in the Northeast may arouse resentment from various countries after this fact is revealed. Based on the principle of fundamentally denying the puppet organization, they will oppose the new tariff rules. (26th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The puppet state was scheduled to unify its currency system on July 1st, with the entire Northeast uniformly using puppet Central Bank banknotes. However, because the people have been using various banknotes for a long time, it is difficult to change them suddenly. Therefore, the puppet government voluntarily postponed it for three months, to October 1st. If they still cannot collect all the notes by then, their use in the market will be prohibited. Due to debt relations, the people have suffered heavy losses after exchanging for puppet currency, although opposition is ineffective. (26th Special Telegram)</p>

There are already more than ten people who have started working in Ji, Yutian, Qian'an and other counties. Most of the applicants are unemployed youths.

<p>(Shanhaiguan) Regarding the matter of joint military exercises by the British, French, and Italian garrison forces inside and outside the pass, Major Iwame, head of the Shanhaiguan Special Service Agency, requested the commanders of the respective countries' garrison forces to notify him in advance. However, on the 20th, the British military commander replied that it was based on the Boxer Protocol and refused to notify. At 10:00 AM on the 25th, the French military commander in Shanhaiguan also visited Major Iwame and replied in the same way as the British, refusing to notify. However, how the Italian military commander will reply is worthy of attention. (26th Den-tsu News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The quantity of goods smuggled to Tianjin by Japanese ships is countless, averaging around 20,000 tons per day. The types are: (1) cotton yarn, (2) rubber shoes, (3) Indian silk, (4) linen yarn, (5) sugar, and (6) daily necessities. Japanese ships importing from Dalian also carry a lot. Nineteen percent of the goods are tax-evading. Japanese youth alliances go to the docks to transport the goods every time a ship arrives. Conflicts occur when customs officers conduct thorough inspections, so customs officers regard inspecting Japanese ships as a difficult task. Japanese fishing boats transport tax-evading goods to Tianjin. The places of departure are four: 1. Dalian, 2. Yingkou, 3. Andong, and 4. Huludao. Although the Tianjin Customs patrol boats try their best to search, they cannot prevent it entirely. (26th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(5) Committee member Luo Jialun is recommended to attend the report next Monday. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the Central Standing Committee decided that Luo Jialun would serve exclusively as the president of National Central University and that Cheng Tianfang would succeed him as the director of academic affairs of the Central Political School. After that, reporters learned the general process as follows: Since the National Government issued an order stipulating that university presidents should not hold concurrent positions, Luo Jialun, president of National Central University, repeatedly pleaded with the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to resign from the position of president of National Central University. In addition to expressing condolences, the Executive Yuan and the Ministry did not announce the previous news, fearing that it would hinder the university's progress. This time, Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing, and Luo reiterated his request. Chiang highly praised the academic atmosphere and discipline of the Central Political School, but since National Central University was stabilizing and making progress, he did not advocate any changes. Since the Central Political School had been established and was on track, there was a proposal to have Luo serve exclusively as the president of National Central University and find someone else to preside over the academic affairs of the Central Political School. It is heard that Chiang recently sent another personal letter to Nanjing, and the proposal was made at the Standing Committee meeting on the 26th, stating that Comrade Luo Jialun, Director of Academic Affairs of the Central Political School, is currently the President of National Central University, and it is now proposed that the Central Government give him full responsibility as the President of National Central University. The vacant position of Director of Academic Affairs of the Central Political School is proposed to be succeeded by Comrade Cheng Tianfang, and Comrade Liu Zhendong is appointed as Deputy Director of Academic Affairs. The proposal was then passed, and the school issued a school order according to Chairman Chiang's handwritten instructions, appointing Cheng Tianfang as Director of Academic Affairs and Liu as Deputy Director, and Luo still guided school affairs in the name of a member of the school affairs committee. Cheng has long experience in running education. It is said that he is currently in Jiangxi, and Luo has sent a telegram to welcome him and asked him to come to Nanjing immediately to preside over the entrance examination.

<h3 id="e28">The Assassination of Dollfuss and the Future of Europe <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Engelbert Dollfuss, Chancellor of Austria, assumed the position of Chancellor in May of the 21st year of the Republic of China [1932], amidst a time of crisis. For two years, he endured countless hardships. On the left, he confronted the Social Democratic Party, ultimately using an iron fist in February of this year to end the party's power in Austria. On the right, he battled the National Socialist Party, preventing it from seizing the opportunity of Hitler's rise in Germany to achieve a German-Austrian merger. During his time in office, Dollfuss spared no effort in suppressing the activities of both parties. Now, he has been reported killed due to the National Socialists' attack on the Chancellery. As the shocking news spread, Italy sought to increase troops along the Austrian border, and Germany ordered the closure of the borders between the two countries. The entire country was placed under martial law, and the world was shaken. Although Austrian President Miklas has appointed the Minister of Education to temporarily maintain the overall situation, domestic order remains in turmoil. The situation in Central Europe has suddenly changed, much like a stone thrown into water, with ripples spreading in all directions. Examining the causes and consequences, there are things worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Austria, located in the heart of Europe, inherently lacks the possibility of independence. However, the Treaty of Saint-Germain insisted on its independence. Economically, Austria, a small country, cannot be self-sufficient in agricultural products, and its industrial products are difficult to sell domestically and internationally. It is only because France and its allies want to maintain the security of the Versailles system, preventing Czechoslovakia and other Little Entente countries from being directly threatened by Germany, and preventing direct contact between the two powers of Germany and Italy, that Austria can barely maintain political independence. However, its citizens are dissatisfied with the status quo and eager to change course. Therefore, the left-leaning Socialist Party held power in the past, and the right-leaning National Socialist Party gained momentum later. Dollfuss relied on the power of his Christian Social Party and further utilized the military force of the monarchists, maneuvering between the left and right factions. Since compromise was impossible, he resorted to massacre and repressive policies. Since breaking the left wing with machine guns and cannons in February, knowledgeable people have all known that Dollfuss was only creating opportunities for the National Socialist Party and would inevitably be overthrown by the National Socialist Party one day. After the Socialists were brutally killed, those who hated Dollfuss, having no way out to the left, competed to join the right-leaning National Socialist Party to express their resentment. Although Dollfuss threatened with hanging, he could not suppress the tide of opposition. Dollfuss's policy was to maintain Austria's independence, but in fact, Austria cannot survive without economic cooperation with other countries. Germany and Austria can rely on each other economically. The so-called German-Austrian economic cooperation movement has been advocated by countless people since Bismarck. However, the realization of this matter will endanger the security of the Little Entente countries and France and Italy. Therefore, years ago, the International Court of Justice recognized that the customs union between the two countries was contrary to the spirit of the peace treaty. France, in this eventful autumn, wanted to help Dollfuss but lacked the strength to assist. Therefore, Dollfuss's only way out was to seek help from Italy. After the February coup, Austria, Hungary, and Italy already had the intention of cooperating, but its effectiveness was still minimal. Before his death, Dollfuss planned to meet with Mussolini, presumably to seek solutions to such problems.</p>
<p>Although Dollfuss often used an iron fist to quell unrest, he was ultimately unable to suppress the National Socialist Party's rebellion. His death in the national crisis was also dictated by the general trend. The question that arises is: after Dollfuss's death, how will Austria maintain this precarious situation? And Austria's problem is also the problem of Germany, Italy, and France. Hitler's connivance with the insurgents has aroused criticism from neighboring countries, and Mussolini has also declared that German-Austrian unification will not be allowed, indicating that a conflict between Germany and Italy is very possible. If the power of the insurgents in Austria expands, then the conflict between Germany and France and Germany and the Little Entente countries will also be difficult to avoid. If the National Socialist Party gains power in Austria, it is tantamount to Hitler spreading his swastika flag throughout Austria. The merger of Germany and Austria is only a matter of time. If this matter is indeed realized, it will surely make</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia frightened, and the Austrians and Hungarians within Romania and Yugoslavia are also afraid that they will rise up in revolt. The unrest in Central Europe is a matter of expectation.</p>
<p>Some say that the peace and war in Europe lies on the shoulders of this so-called "Little Napoleon," Dollfuss. Now that Dollfuss is dead, how can Europe avoid great chaos? This is the most urgent question today.</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) According to the Provincial Government, there is no hope for tax revenue due to the drought. Various administrative agencies have no choice but to cut salaries to maintain the status quo. The salary cut meeting was seriously discussed at the provincial government meeting on the 26th. It is reported that the principle has been largely decided: a 40% reduction will be paid starting in August, temporarily limited to three months. However, the specific measures must wait until Zeng Yangfu returns to the province before they can be decided. According to Secretary-General Lu, the treasury only had three yuan left yesterday, which proves that the source of finance in Zhejiang Province has been exhausted and has reached the most serious period.

<p>(London) All of Europe recognizes that the European powder keg has now moved from the Balkans to Vienna.

British newspapers deeply feel the dangerous potential in the current situation. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The changes in Austria have caused some major European politicians to change their strategies, most notably Mussolini, who returned to Rome from Liciano and discussed with his cabinet members the necessary actions to be taken in response to Austria. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Rome Italian Prime Minister Mussolini telegraphed Austrian Deputy Chancellor Starhemberg today, making a strong statement that Italy is prepared to safeguard Austria's complete independence. Mussolini firmly declared in the telegram, "Austria's independence has been and will be safeguarded by Italy."

<p>(Berlin) German officials now hold the attitude that the Vienna incident is purely an internal disturbance, but they also express fear that the events in Vienna will have a serious reaction in Germany. It is noteworthy that the initial semi-official reports on the Austrian change were all in a pleasant tone, but when the coup in Vienna failed, the tone of these reports completely changed. A certain news agency published its obtained information, stating, "The failure of the Austrian Chancellor is due to God's will, and the new government must protect the idea of a Greater Germany," etc. At the same time, Munich is very active. There are 3,000 Austrian National Socialist volunteers there, armed with machine guns and field guns, ready to depart immediately. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>The Austrian Socialist Party's conspiracy to resist the government was discovered, and less than forty-eight hours later, the Prime Minister suddenly met a violent end. The speed of the incident was completely beyond expectation. Italy is now most shocked, because the Austrian Prime Minister had scheduled a meeting with the Italian Prime Minister, set for today in Liciano.

<p>When the news of the Austrian National Socialist rebellion came to Budapest this afternoon, the mood here was quite tense. Austria and Hungary have always had extremely close friendship, both politically and economically. Prime Minister Dollfuss has traveled to Hungary several times and has been warmly welcomed by the Hungarian government and people. Recently, Austrian Minister of Public Security Feesch traveled to Budapest to discuss with the Hungarian Minister of Internal Affairs methods to jointly suppress the disturbances of the National Socialist Party, which shows the close cooperation between the two countries. However, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös also expressed sympathy for the Hitler government, so it is difficult to fathom what kind of attitude he will take towards the Austrian National Socialist Party. If the Vienna incident is quickly quelled this time, it will only add a page to the history of Vienna's troubled times. If not, if the Austrian National Socialist rebellion continues to expand, it is not known whether it will spread beyond the Austrian border and cause Hungary to be caught in the crossfire. This is what people here are deeply worried about. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>The Austrian Prime Minister Who Died in the Disaster</p>
<h3 id="e43">A Short Biography of Dollfuss <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Dollfuss, born into a farming family, relied on his talent and opportunity to rise to the position of Prime Minister. Standing less than five feet tall, he was nicknamed "Dwarf Premier" by the people of Vienna. Among the young and short Prime Ministers of European countries, Dollfuss was undoubtedly the most prominent. In 1933, during a time of urgent European turmoil, Dollfuss was a figure of focus for all of Europe. His resistance to the encroachment of Hitler's forces into Austria was seen by many as a David bravely fighting Goliath in history. Europeans were wary of the growing militaristic spirit of Germany and encouraged Dollfuss to be the pillar resisting the raging tide of the National Socialist Party. However, Dollfuss was also one of the dictators of Europe and resolutely abolished the parliament in 1933, which led those in Austria and elsewhere who favored democracy to criticize his actions. In the summer of 1933, Dollfuss personally attended the World Economic Conference in London. His lively spirit, strong will, and dedication to his duties were greatly admired by the British people.</p>
<p>Dollfuss was born on October 4, 1892, in Texingtal, Lower Austria, to a farming family. Dollfuss always took pride in this when speaking with his friends. After graduating from Hollabrunn High School, Dollfuss went to Vienna to study law and then to Berlin to study national economics. At the beginning of the European War, Dollfuss volunteered for service on the front lines, serving for about three years and receiving several medals for his bravery. After the end of the European War, he returned to study in Germany and then worked for the German Farmers' Association. He usually enjoyed studying agriculture and later returned to his country to take a position as secretary of the Lower Austria Farmers' Association. In 1927, he became the chairman of the same provincial farmers’ union.</p>
<p>Dollfuss had a deep understanding of the suffering of the common people, so his national prestige grew day by day. In his various positions, he often sought the happiness of the farmers. The establishment of the Farmers' Insurance Association and the implementation of a monopoly on the import of wheat and flour were largely due to Dollfuss' efforts.</p>
<p>On July 22, 1930, he was elected to the Austrian State Railways Bureau as a representative of the farmers. After six weeks, he was appointed Deputy Director of the bureau, and three weeks later, he was promoted to Director.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1931, the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Zeiler, resigned, and Dollfuss was appointed to replace him. On May 5, 1931, the Second Buresch Cabinet resigned, and Dollfuss was ordered to form a cabinet, serving as Prime Minister and concurrently as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Agriculture, and Forestry. Dollfuss' government was formed by members of the Christian Social Party, the Farmers' Party, and the Patriotic League, holding a small majority in parliament. Sometimes, when resolutions were voted on, they only obtained a majority of one vote, which made administration very difficult. The post-war Austrian constitution favored democracy, so the parliament often argued with the government on various matters. Dollfuss often faced obstruction from the parliament during negotiations in Geneva and in dealing with various domestic problems and economic trends caused by the adverse effects of the war. For this reason, Dollfuss and the parliament were at odds. Furthermore, the conflict between the National Socialist Party and the Socialist Party extended until March 1933, when the government resolutely issued an emergency decree banning all kinds of gatherings and demonstrations and restricting the freedom of speech of newspapers. The National Socialist Party newspapers then wantonly attacked the government, leaving it in tatters. However, Dollfuss did not lose heart and finally dissolved the parliament. On September 21 of that year, he reorganized the government on a non-parliamentary basis, hoping to make Austria a "guild" state. Dollfuss then reorganized the cabinet on a non-party basis, and he himself became a de facto dictator, concurrently in charge of the four ministries of Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Public Security, and Agriculture. As a result, he gained control of the military, police, and auxiliary forces. Since the establishment of the Austrian Republic, soldiers had not been allowed to participate in politics, and this was the beginning of that change.</p>
<p>After Dollfuss implemented a strong coup, the fascist and democratic factions in the government competed for power and were at a standstill. In September of that year, when Austria held a ceremony to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Vienna's liberation from Turkish rule, Dollfuss gave a speech to the audience, promising to make Austria an authoritative and cooperative country. This statement was made to quell the arrogance of the National Socialist Party. He then spoke elsewhere, denying that his government could be called fascist. After this, riots and strikes broke out from time to time, and Vienna became a huge military camp.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1933, the activities of the National Socialist Party became increasingly rampant, and rumors abounded, which Dollfuss found almost impossible to cope with. A riot broke out in Innsbruck, and forty party members were arrested. Many arrests were also made in Vienna. By May 16, more than 2,000 people had been arrested for illegal demonstrations and other activities.</p>
<p>In May 1933, when Dollfuss went to London to participate in the World Economic Conference, the domestic situation changed rapidly. He repeatedly received telegrams urging him to return home to deal with the emergency. In the months that followed, the National Socialist Party was restless, throwing bombs in various places and attempting to destroy railways and government offices. In August of that year, Munich, Germany, repeatedly broadcast radio broadcasts inciting the Austrian National Socialist Party to resist the government, which led to protests from the governments of Italy, France, and the United Kingdom to Germany. The German authorities initially did not take the protests seriously, but soon stopped the propaganda. However, the Austrian National Socialist Party tried to become even more powerful, so there was an assassination attempt on Dollfuss on October 3, the eve of Dollfuss's 41st birthday. A member of the National Socialist Party, Mr. Pertti, fired two shots at Dollfuss in the parliament, only wounding his arm. After being wounded, Dollfuss was very calm, refused to go to the hospital for treatment, walked to the door, got into a car, and returned home, ordering not to cause any disturbance.</p>
<p>Dollfuss traveled abroad frequently. In April, June, and August of 1933, he visited Italy three times to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini. The meeting in September was the most important. The Italian Prime Minister had offered to help Austria, and the Pope had awarded him the Golden Spur to commend his achievements in governing Austria. On September 23 of that year, he attended the League of Nations General Assembly in Geneva and was warmly welcomed. The admiration of politicians from various countries for Dollfuss was evident here.</p>
<p>Prince Starhemberg, the leader of the Heimwehr, was more inclined to fascist policies than Dollfuss and urged Dollfuss to severely punish the Socialist Party. Dollfuss did not agree with this, so they were at odds. However, Dollfuss finally reached a compromise with Starhemberg on October 12, 1933, and all the Heimwehr joined Dollfuss's "Patriotic Front," and Starhemberg became Dollfuss's right-hand man. This move was crucial for Austria, because the three giants of Austria, Dollfuss, Starhemberg, and Fey, were now working together to resist National Socialism. In October 1933, Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and then held a general election campaign. The activities of the Austrian National Socialist Party declined slightly as a result, and Dollfuss was able to consolidate his policies at ease and implement the new constitution of the corporatist state. Unexpectedly, he was not able to fully realize his ambitions and suffered a violent death, which was not only a great loss for Austria but also shook the entire European situation. (Reuters)</p>

<p>A Hero in Troubled Times Leaps to Become a New Dictator</p>
<p>Vienna - According to official reports, Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg has already assumed the duties of Prime Minister, and other cabinet members are permanently stationed in their respective ministries. Rumors that Starhemberg will soon succeed as Prime Minister have arisen as a result. (Havas dispatch, 26th) Prince Starhemberg departed from Venice by plane and flew arduously over the Alps, safely arriving in Vienna at 6:37 this morning. His plane attempted to fly over the mountains three times, but due to severe storms, it turned back twice. Prince Starhemberg is only 35 years old, and people believe that he will be a hero in troubled times, leaping to become Austria's new dictator. The 250,000-strong Heimwehr under his command is Austria's elite force. After returning to Vienna, Starhemberg immediately convened an emergency cabinet meeting and decided to establish a military court to try the 114 arrested National Socialist Party members. (National dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Austrian Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg convened his key personnel in Venice at night for a lengthy meeting. They finally decided to conscript 300,000 fascist volunteers.

<p>Venice - Austrian Vice-Chancellor and Commander-in-Chief of the Heimwehr, Prince Starhemberg, failed to return to Vienna by plane. Tonight, he ordered his troops to mobilize immediately by telephone. After hearing about the National Socialist disturbances in Vienna and the assassination of Prime Minister Dollfuss over the phone, the prince boarded a plane to Vienna. However, he encountered wind and rain at the top of the Alps. Although he repeatedly tried to ascend, he was ultimately blocked by the wind and rain and had to turn back. After the mobilization order was issued, the prince received a phone call from Vienna, stating that 250,000 Heimwehr troops had concentrated in accordance with the order, so the mobilization procedures proceeded very quickly.

<p>Vienna - According to reliable sources, there will be no changes to the cabinet until after the funeral of the late Prime Minister Dollfuss. The President and Vice-Chancellor have both arrived in Vienna. Federal Commissioner Adam announced on the radio last night that after Prime Minister Dollfuss was killed, the rioters not only refused to allow him to receive medical treatment but also refused to summon a priest to perform last rites. Adam said that Prime Minister Dollfuss died alone among the enemy. He also said, "Today's tragedy cannot be regarded as a large-scale rebellion, but as a well-planned and heinous riot." After returning to Vienna this morning, the Austrian President went to the Prime Minister's Office to pay his respects to Dollfuss's remains. He then issued an official gazette, stating that if there was a rebellion, it has been quelled. However, there are still rebel factions active in Styria, but it is heard that they are gradually disappearing. It is heard that only four people died in Vienna besides the assassination of Prime Minister Dollfuss, including two policemen, one gatekeeper, and one actor who was shot down by a stray bullet while leaving the broadcasting station. According to general observations, the Austrian President will strive to organize a new government on a broader basis, or may hold a general election. Because without the support of the majority of the people, a stable government cannot be established. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Vienna: Austria underwent a major political upheaval today. The details that have come to light are as follows. At 1:00 PM, a number of National Socialist terrorists stormed the broadcasting studio of the Radio Verkehrs AG (the central radio station), aiming to cut off the wires connecting the broadcasting studio with the transmission station. At that time, one of the terrorists announced over the airwaves that the government had resigned, and thus the alarming news of the coup was transmitted everywhere via radio. The director of the Radio Verkehrs AG, Mr. Holder, was killed on the spot by the National Socialist Party members. When the police outside the radio station learned that an incident had occurred, they immediately surrounded the radio station and opened fire with machine guns into the building. At the same time, several bombs exploded inside the building, causing a fire to break out. Because the National Socialist Party members were all dressed in police uniforms, the police action was extremely difficult. By 2:00 PM, the transmission station of the central radio station had been restored to its original state, and the police attack on the broadcasting studio continued unabated. As a result, the sound of gunfire transmitted from the radio was clearly discernible. By 4:00 PM, the National Socialist Party members surrendered and were captured by the police. It is estimated that many National Socialist Party members died, and one policeman died. At that time, the streets were patrolled by police, and the government offices of the various ministries were occupied by federal troops, who set up machine guns. By 4:00 PM, a large contingent of federal troops had entered the Prime Minister's Office. Prime Minister Dollfuss, Minister of Public Security Fey, Secretary-General of the State Council Karwinsky, and others had been detained by National Socialist Party members inside the Prime Minister's Office. Communication between the Prime Minister's Office and the outside world was cut off from 2:00 PM. It was rumored that Dollfuss had been shot and wounded by National Socialist Party members, and that his injuries were quite serious. The National Socialist Party members, dressed in police uniforms, stormed into the Prime Minister's Office. It was heard that Prime Minister Dollfuss had</p>
<p>announced his intention to resign. In addition, it was heard that a large number of National Socialist Party members had gathered in the suburbs of Vienna, but the armed farmers of Lower Austria Province had also gathered to intervene and assist the government if necessary. After news of the resignation of the Stanz local government in Styria Province was released, 400 National Socialist Party members carrying firearms attacked the gendarmes on guard. One gendarme was shot and killed. At 3:00 PM, a patrolman in Innsbruck City was attacked and killed by two National Socialist Party members. The murderers were arrested on the spot.

<p>(London) Yesterday morning at 11:30, when the cabinet was in session, the rebels began their activities. 150 members of the Austrian National Socialist Party, all dressed in police uniforms, gathered at the athletic club to finalize their plans. Then, they rushed to the room where the cabinet was meeting. Minister of Public Security and Minister of Interior Fey and his confidant, Deputy Minister of Defense Karwinsky, were immediately arrested. Prime Minister Tao had already left the room, but he was shot before he could get far. When Fey was taken to another room by a group of National Socialist Party members, "Little Napoleon" was lying on a sofa, barely breathing, with a bullet wound through his throat. Tao was only strong enough to speak a few words to his adjutant, murmuring, "Please take care of my family." After saying this, he breathed his last. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Minister of Public Security Fey reported today's incident on the radio, saying that Prime Minister Dollfuss was holding a State Council meeting, chairing the meeting himself. Suddenly, it was heard that members of the National Socialist Party, dressed in police uniforms, had sneaked into the office. They immediately stopped the meeting. However, the members of the National Socialist Party had already entered the room and detained Dollfuss, Fey, and Secretary-General Karwinsky. Then, they demanded a guarantee that they would not be punished and that they would be sent to the border before the cabinet members would be released. According to Acting Prime Minister Schuschnigg's estimation, a total of 144 rioters entered the Prime Minister's Office. After being surrounded by the military and police, they submitted a letter of surrender, requesting mediation by the German Ambassador to Austria. Furthermore, the new chief of detectives, Adam, described Dollfuss's final moments on the radio, saying that about a dozen rioters entered Dollfuss's office. The leader of the rioters saw Dollfuss and immediately fired two shots, both of which hit him in the chest. At that time, the servants in the room had been driven to other rooms, leaving only Dollfuss. After being shot, he ordered Fey to come forward and receive his last will. The rioters refused to allow a doctor to be summoned for treatment and refused to allow a pastor to perform the sacrament. At that point, Dollfuss breathed his last. In addition, the Vienna Daily reported that Dollfuss died at 4:30 PM. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Known Internationally as Little Napoleon, He Had Three Major Diplomatic Successes Vienna: Prime Minister Dollfuss was murdered by the National Socialists yesterday. Dollfuss was the youngest and smallest dictator in Europe, but his self-confidence and his brave, wise and ambitious talent were similar to Napoleon's. It was all Dollfuss's own strength that Austria was able to break away from the shackles of the Treaty of Saint-Germain and occupy a new place on the map of Europe. Dollfuss's success depended entirely on his ability to use international forces and domestic military, police and financial relations, but he claimed that it was all heavenly assistance. Dollfuss did not change his mind once he had made up his mind. It was not intentional stubbornness, but his determination came after much consideration and prayer. Whenever faced with difficult problems, he would go to church to pray for divine guidance, so although his attitude was firm, even his political enemies did not laugh at him. In May 1932, President Miklas ordered Dollfuss to form a cabinet. At that time, Dollfuss was the Minister of Agriculture. After receiving the order, the domestic political and economic situation worsened within a few months. After the dissolution of the parliament, Dollfuss took the post of dictator until now. Dollfuss had three major successes in the international community. The first was his efforts at the London World Economic Conference, the second was Austria's obtaining assistance from the League of Nations and issuing bonds in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and other countries, and the third was his conflict with German Chancellor Hitler, which was intervened by the United Kingdom, France and Italy, who were deeply afraid of the merger of Germany and Austria, which Dollfuss was able to use. Dollfuss was also deeply opposed to the Jewish nation, but he never used violence to deal with them. (National dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(London) The Austrian incident came suddenly. British public opinion, after the initial shock, felt very uneasy. Coupled with the worrying tone of various newspapers, the anxiety has only deepened. The Daily Telegraph reported, "Yesterday's Austrian incident, its serious nature is self-evident. The impact it may have internationally is even more significant, as the independence of Austria is a matter of concern to the survival interests of all European countries." The Liberal Party's News Chronicle researches methods to guarantee European peace, saying, "Generally speaking, if European countries, and narrowly speaking, Austria's neighboring countries, can clearly express their determination to maintain international peace in response to this new situation, it would be of no small benefit to the new Austrian government." The Labour Party's Daily Herald believes that "Austria's Christian Pan-Germanism (i.e., the Christian Social Party led by Dollfuss) will not be able to hold power for long, and the Schuschnigg government will inevitably collapse soon." Looking at the above commentaries, the British Liberal and Labour newspapers have not yet forgiven Dollfuss for his suppression of the Socialists' uprising in February of this year, but the Conservative newspapers express admiration for Dollfuss's life with sympathy.

<p>(Paris) After the news of the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss arrived, it caused a great shock here. Newspapers expressed extreme indignation at the Nazi Party's means of killing "the guarantor of Austria's independence," feeling that such an incident should not be regarded merely as a sad state of internal instability. In reality, it is also the result of Germany's "eastern expansion" policy. The so-called eastern expansion policy, its first step is the realization of the merger of Germany and Austria. Newspapers also mentioned the attitude that the League of Nations and the three countries responsible for guaranteeing Austria's independence—Italy, England, and France—could adopt. Le Figaro reported, "Among all the impressions we have, the most profound is that the German Hitler government bears great responsibility. This crime was instigated and guided by Germany. Can Europe tolerate this any longer? Can Britain, France, and Italy turn a blind eye? Can the League of Nations stand by?" Le Journal reported, "The current situation is serious no matter how you look at it. If the countries' front lines cannot unite after Dollfuss's death, the situation will become critical from serious. But Austrian independence must be maintained, and Italy should take the lead in taking emergency measures, as the Italian troops stationed in Trentino are only a stone's throw away from Innsbruck in Austria. Can the Germans make another mistake?" (Note: Trentino was originally part of Austria, located on the northern border of Italy, but was returned to Italy after the European War.) Le Petit Journal reported, "In any case, all of Europe is already on alert." L'Homme Libre reported, "If we want to avoid a worse situation, emergency measures cannot be delayed."

<h3 id="e67">What Happens After the Death of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss? A Wild Guess <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>(I) The Position of a Little Napoleon</p>
<p>Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss has been assassinated. At this moment, perhaps those political commentators who like to make alarmist remarks will say that this is the second Sarajevo. Whether this incident will lead to a second Sarajevo depends on whether the responsible European politicians deal with it carefully, and whether emotion or reason is the more powerful factor. Intuitively, Dollfuss's death does have the potential to lead to war. If the new government cannot suppress the rebellion, we wonder if France, Italy, and the Little Entente countries will send troops to intervene. If the National Socialist Party fails and retreats into German territory, we wonder if Germany will help these Germanic brothers. We hope that Hitler, Mussolini, and Doumergue will not rely solely on intuition, but we must recognize the seriousness of this incident.</p>
<p>Why does a pocket chancellor, less than five feet tall, have such a large impact on international war or peace? Because he is the representative of Austria's independence. Austria's independence is the center of the Versailles system. The Versailles system is the result of four years of bloody battles, and how many unjust bones and blood have been piled up and dyed to create it. This system needs blood and bones to build, and it takes blood and bones to destroy this system and build another system. Now that Dollfuss has been killed, Austria's independence has become a very serious issue. Those who want to maintain the Versailles system and those who want to destroy the Versailles system are gradually coming into direct conflict. A curtain has been drawn, and whether the play inside will be a martial drama is very worrying.</p>
<p>(II) Dollfuss in the Last Two Years</p>
<p>Dollfuss has been able to maintain his political life for two years because he was happy to be isolated. In foreign policy, he advocated maintaining Austria's independence, and in politics, he has always been a neutralist. When the year of the Republic 21 (1932) came, the Socialists and the right-wing parties attacked each other and could not compromise. His Christian Social Party was composed of conservatives in Vienna and patriots in the countryside. Because he was neither left nor right, he was able to leap from Minister of Agriculture to Prime Minister. Last spring, he turned against the Socialists, dissolved parliament, and at the same time, he not only disbanded the Socialist army, but also searched the headquarters of the National Socialist Party. Last September, he cooperated with the Home Guard, which was a private army that was very reactionary. Dollfuss used them to deal with the left and right wings. Although everyone promoted that this army would revolutionize Dollfuss's life, it has not been realized to this day.</p>
<p>He sought a way out from being attacked on both sides, and the methods he used were very vicious. After Hitler's victory in Germany, the National Socialists vigorously advocated the merger of Germany and Austria, and the National Socialist Party in Germany also helped them in various ways. Hitler's followers used radio broadcasts in Sengcheng to attack Dollfuss's speeches, swaying the psychology of the Austrian people. Dollfuss then arrested the leaders of the National Socialist Party within the country and sought assistance from the League of Nations. Because Austria's existence and the League of Nations' existence are two and one, the three countries of England, France, and Italy jointly declared in February to maintain Austria's independence.</p>
<p>The Home Guard helped Dollfuss clear out the Socialists as a condition, and the Socialists also knew that Dollfuss's dictatorship was not in their favor. On February 12, the Socialists announced a general strike. Dollfuss preemptively destroyed the Socialists' base with artillery and machine guns, killing many left-wing leaders. Those who hated Dollfuss rose up to join the National Socialist Party in an attempt to take revenge. Since reducing the Socialists, he has focused on dealing with the National Socialist Party. On the one hand, he formulated a dictatorial constitution, and on the other hand, he used imprisonment, exile, afforestation, and even execution to suppress the National Socialist Party. This uprising of the National Socialist Party can also be said to be a reaction to Dollfuss's high-pressure policies.</p>
<p>(III) Why Must Austria Be Independent?</p>
<p>Why couldn't Dollfuss die? Because only he can keep Austria independent. Why must Austria be independent? Because once Austria moves, the map of Europe will change color. Austria cannot be independent. In economic terms, its agriculture cannot be self-sufficient, and its industry needs markets elsewhere. Since the Treaty of Versailles, Austria is like a fat man who has been stripped to the bone. Industry is gradually disappearing, and banks are bankrupt. Starting in the year of the Republic 12 (1923), Austria's finances have been maintained by borrowing from the League of Nations. The League of Nations sent a commissioner to Vienna, and all finances were in his hands. If Austria and Germany merge, the two can help each other economically. What's more, the people of Austria and Germany are of the same race and culture. The National Socialist Party wants the Austrian people to let Hitler govern Austria. There is no reason for this.</p>
<p>However, the Treaty of Saint-Germain does not allow Austria and Germany to cooperate. There is even more reason. If Austria joins Germany, Germany will add six million people. The Czech's survival becomes a problem, because in this way, the Czechs are wrapped in Germany. Germany's southern border will connect with Italy, and in the east, it will border Hungary, resulting in Germany being the southern king in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Moreover, there are three million Germans in the Czech Republic, and most of their residences are adjacent to Germany and Austria. Once Germany and Austria merge, the Czech Republic has no reason to persuade these three million Germans to stay under the flag of a foreign race. But if these three million people rebel and return to Germany, the total population of the Czech Republic, which is fourteen million, will lose a quarter of its population, and its territory will be lost. Can the Czech Republic still be a country?</p>
<p>What's more, there are some non-Czech people in the Czech Republic who have long wanted to break away, such as the 690,000 Hungarians, who are still attached to their homeland. If the Czech Republic loses its existence due to Austria's independence, the map of Europe will be even more different. Among the Little Entente countries, Yugoslavia and Romania are profiting from the Versailles system, and the foreign races within their borders will definitely think of rebellion. The Hungarians will definitely have another "return to the motherland" movement. On the Polish side, because of the Czech's demise, not only will they lose an anti-German assistant, but Germany's opportunity to invade Poland will also increase. Italy has no love for the Versailles system. However, after the Great War, she also obtained the Druer region inhabited by Germans and many coastal territories formerly owned by Austria. Mussolini and Hitler are separated by an Austria, so they are not like-minded friends. Once Austria disappears, the Germans will once again look at Rome across the Alps, which the Italians cannot sleep peacefully about.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Dollfuss dies, Austria's independence is shaken. If Austria is not independent, the new borders of Europe will be like rotten ropes, precarious and about to break.</p>
<p>(IV) How Will the Great Powers Deal With It?</p>
<p>Germany's Hitler is in a position regarding this Austrian rebel party much like Wilhelm II was to the Austrian government when the European War was about to happen. In fact, Germany can control it, and the great powers regard every move of Austria as Germany's order. If we want to ask how Germany will deal with it, we must look at Hitler's position in Germany. Undoubtedly, his position has not been shaken, and he is looking for an opportunity to shift the people's focus to the outside. Domestic failures are often decorated with martial exploits. What's more, with the patriotic enthusiasm of the Germans, they will support their leader if he is tough on the outside.</p>
<p>Italy will not allow the National Socialist Party to take power in Austria. Mussolini has repeatedly declared that Austria's independence must be maintained. We want to ask, if the new cabinet is overthrown and the National Socialist Party takes power, will Italy send troops to intervene? I don't think Italy will take unilateral action, and England and France will cooperate with Italy. The League of Nations is an organization established to maintain the Versailles system, and it must be used at this moment. If Austria is brought to the point of international co-management, it is difficult to guarantee that the National Socialist Party will not start an incident internally. If this thorny problem is not solved with a calm and cautious mind, the result will be chaos.</p>
<p>France and the Little Entente countries undoubtedly want to punish the National Socialist Party. What's more, if Italy is willing to participate, they will gain even more courage. England is also afraid of Germany's expansion, and public opinion will definitely show dissatisfaction with the National Socialist Party's actions, but her attitude will not be as active as France's. At this critical moment, the most noteworthy thing is still Hitler's attitude. If he wants to bet everything on one throw, using the Austrian problem to vent his accumulated anger since taking office, that is a policy of preferring to be a shattered jade rather than a complete tile, and he will definitely be able to gain the support of the German people, but the result is unimaginable. If he is willing to give in, let the League of Nations handle Austria, and let the National Socialist Party be punished, then how long his authority in Germany can be maintained is unknown.</p>
<p>Some say that this uprising of the National Socialist Party is related to Hitler's and Mussolini's previous meeting, or that Italy and Germany have already reached an understanding. However, this speculation has no sufficient evidence and can only be used for reference. (July 26, 9 PM)</p>

According to information from Taiwan, the conference opened at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th. Governor-General Nakagawa attended the meeting, read the imperial rescript on Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, and explained the purpose of convening the conference on the other side of the Taiwan Strait and the attitude towards South China. Then, the various cases were discussed. The conference lasted for three days, and the closing ceremony was held at 5:00 p.m. after the last meeting at 4:00 p.m. on the 20th. The following cases were publicly announced by the documents section of the Governor-General's Office:</p>

<p>The Taiwan Governor-General's Office's convening of this "Conference on the Other Side of the Strait" has temporarily attracted international attention. South China, the Philippines, and the British and Dutch territories in Southeast Asia are all on edge. According to Taiwan Governor-General Nakagawa, who made a statement to reporters after the conference, "The consular conference is easily attracting attention from all parties because it is being held at a time of tense circumstances. However, the consular conference is not as significant or secret as some have claimed. Consular conferences were held twice during the era of Governor-General Tian, but they were interrupted due to the busy affairs of the Governor-General's Office. This time is merely a revival. Regarding Taiwan's policy towards the other side, the basic principle is to enhance the culture between us. Other than that, there is nothing else besides the economic revitalization of the Taiwanese residents and Japanese expatriates in those areas. The operation of social facilities such as hospitals, schools, and news businesses is also in line with the above principle. In order to thoroughly strengthen our opinions, disputes and misunderstandings often arise between us. In order to prevent this from happening, we have each consul come here once a year for various cordial talks, and we will continue to hold them in the future. As a result of this conference, if there is a need for positive measures on the other side in the future, we will increase the budget within the possible scope to promote the 'Policy on the Other Side'," etc. Although the Governor-General's statement is intended to explain the situation, the words are still worthy of contemplation. Tsukamoto Takeshi, the Japanese Consul in Xiamen who attended the meeting, returned to Xiamen on the Guangdong Maru today (the 23rd) after the conference. )23rd(</p>

Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the government sent the fishing boat Feizhun Maru, with technicians such as Okuma, to the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong to investigate fishing grounds. In the area between 114 and 112 degrees east longitude, the nets were cast 19 times, and the total amount of fish caught was about 10,000 jin. In the area between 112 and 110 degrees east longitude, the nets were cast 11 times, and more than 10,000 jin of fish were also caught. According to the investigation results, the area around 112 degrees 30 minutes east longitude and 15 degrees 30 minutes north latitude is actually a densely populated fish area. The fish are mostly of the Banzai red snapper type. Also, about 30 li south of Dajima Island in Penghu Island, a large amount of red snapper fish was also discovered. Fishing boats from the Taichung area go there to fish and can catch 8,000 jin per day. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Wuchang County Magistrate Requests Trial of Artificial Rainmaking Method <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The magistrate of Wuchang County recently submitted a request to the Hubei Provincial Government to imitate the scientific artificial rainmaking method of the United States and Britain to relieve the drought. The original report stated, "Submitting a report for the drought is about to form, earnestly requesting to imitate the scientific artificial rainmaking method of the United States and Britain, trial implementation and verification, and praying for regulations to be established for disaster relief measures after the disaster occurs, so as to promote and rescue, and looking forward to verification and compliance. I, Wuchang County, have suffered a severe flood in the previous year, and the people have been displaced and dispersed, and the vitality has not yet recovered. Following this, the grain prices were low last year, hurting farmers, and the villages are on the verge of bankruptcy. It is heard that the water level of the Yangtze River will increase this year, and all of them are frightened and afraid. However, since the beginning of summer, there has been little rain, the soil is scorched, and the beans and wheat have failed. The county magistrate inspected the villages, and in the space of two weeks, the fields that had already been sown were withered, and the ponds and weirs were dried up, and the view was barren. The disaster of flooding has not been eliminated, and the scorched earth has appeared. All industries are declining, and thousands of households are sighing. The county magistrate is mediocre and disregards the hardships of the people. I believe that the policy of thinking about trouble and preventing it, as well as disaster relief, dare not resign from responsibility. Respectfully, I would like to present what I know for your consideration. In the case of prolonged drought, the traditional methods of disaster relief in our country have always been prayers and prohibitions. In tracing the origin, it is just that the ancient sages and philosophers were expedient measures to calm people's hearts at the time. The intention cannot be faulted, but it is close to superstition and has no basis in fact. It is not to be talked about in the modern world of scientific enlightenment. The county magistrate, in view of the fact that the farmers in our country are bound by ancient methods and have never paid attention to water conservancy, rely entirely on timely rain and sunshine as a standard for abundance, which is not a good plan. In this time of drought, it was initially proposed to try to use water pumps for irrigation. After consulting with President Shao of the College of Engineering of Wuhan University, and after consulting with people in the county, it was considered that each water pump would cost about 30,000 yuan, plus more than 20,000 yuan for a black oil engine, for a total of more than 50,000 yuan. The construction is very expensive, and the fields are not connected or penetrated by ditches, making it difficult to use them all over. Moreover, the county lacks technical talents, making it difficult to design accurately. However, thinking of the many lakes in the county, if there is such equipment, the lake area may be very wide, and at least a part of the relief can be obtained. Unfortunately, due to the limited time and financial resources, even the palliative measures are still not enough to meet the urgent needs. Later, I thought that in June of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Hong Kong suffered from a severe drought and a lack of drinking water. It was reported that the British Governor sent two planes to throw Kaya Lin powder in the air, and it rained after two hours. However, the telex transmission was brief, and there was no academic basis to obtain it. Now, I have checked the magazines published by the China Science Society this year. The 21st issue of the Science Daily contains two kinds of artificial rainmaking methods. One was invented by American scientists Warren and Professor Benkrolo. A large amount of electrified sand is applied and carried to the high altitude by airplanes and scattered in the atmosphere. Soon the rain will fall. According to Professor Peng's estimate, 40 pounds of electrified sand can dissolve one square mile of cloud into rain. The other is Professor Vera's test, using a kind of very fine dry ice, that is, solid carbon dioxide, flown by a single-wing aircraft to 2,500 meters and scattered in the clouds, and artificial rain will fall. The two are very clear in their principles and methods. According to the theory, the trial implementation. The county magistrate follows the habit of the Chinese people. At the beginning of the discovery of a truth, they often scoff at it as nonsense and refuse to test and study it. Therefore, things often lag behind others. The Premier knew it, so he ordered the gist of "Chinese people know the difficulty of doing things" and the saying of "catching up". I believe that this scientific artificial rainmaking method is indeed not baseless. With the convenience of using aircraft in Wuhan, the ease of purchasing chemical raw materials, and the gathering of scientists, it can be verified and tried everywhere. If it is legally used, it will have the effect of a timely rain. If it fails, the loss will be only a small amount of raw materials, and the cost will be very small. Even if no observation is made at present, there will be a day when research will be successful through this advocacy. Moreover, it was reported in December of the 22nd year that some scientists and water conservancy experts in North China, after the Soviet Union invented artificial rain, were also gathering comrades to initiate the organization of an artificial rain research association, saying that they would conduct considerable experiments on both sides of the Yellow Canal, etc. Today, whether this association has been established or not, the details are not known. However, the attention of the people in our country to this research has already been seen. If the government had subsidized and rewarded it earlier, there might have been considerable performance. This is one of the reasons why the county magistrate is not afraid of detouring and dare to make a trivial request. Secondly, if the trial fails, the sky will still not rain, or the rain will not be sufficient, and the disaster cannot be avoided. In order to seek remedies, it is planned to plant late rice and supplement autumn miscellaneous grains, such as buckwheat, corn, autumn beans, vegetables, or other suitable agricultural products. Special promotion and encouragement will be given. As for the lending of seeds and the financing of funds, it will only depend on the Farmers Bank and the Rural Cooperative. This is two things that I dare to ask for and implement universally. Furthermore, when a certain incident occurs, the Chinese people are often flustered and unprepared, and it is too late to plan. After it passes, they forget it and do not take the opportunity to learn from the past and make up for the lost sheep. Therefore, for thousands of years, in the intersection of water and drought, I do not know how many times it has evolved, and there is no thorough prevention method. The county magistrate believes that although the effect of water pumps is great, when the land is red for thousands of miles, even if there are ditches, there is no way to irrigate them. I have heard that the French Southern region has implemented a honeycomb-style stone tower to collect water from the air, and the results are excellent. This method was adopted in the city of Aotou Xiaya on the coast of the Black Sea 2,300 years ago. Now France has made it scientific and more advanced. The principle is to condense the moisture contained in the air into a liquid. The area of condensation into water is 6,000 gallons of water per day for every 1,000 square feet of tower. It can be taken endlessly and used endlessly. Our country can take this as an example. If you order students from this province studying in France or directly entrust our country's embassy in France to conduct on-the-spot investigations, draw patterns, and detail the construction and construction methods, it will not be difficult to order them to imitate this kind of building everywhere. It must be simple and easy to implement. It is not a secret building. The relationship with national defense is comparable. There should be no difficulty in the investigation. This is also a third thing to prevent future droughts, and I dare to ask for the promotion of imitation construction. In summary, except for the second item, which belongs to the county to be able to follow and implement, the other items are compared to empty words and theories, which are of no benefit to the actual situation. I think that theory is the mother of facts. Mussolini said, "Work belongs to everyone, discussion belongs to a few, and decision belongs to one person." All of the above are within the scope of theory. Whether it is feasible or not, please convene experts to discuss it in detail, formulate a plan, and decide to implement it by the provincial government to save the people and benefit the people's livelihood. I am extremely terrified and await orders," etc. (Attachments omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Jiangsu Province Drought Relief and Post-Disaster Work Relief Plan <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Divided into Dredging Rivers and Supplementing Rural Sidelines</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, went to Beijing to attend the Administrative Yuan's temporary drought relief meeting. He was ordered to draft a work relief plan for the Administrative Yuan meeting's discussion. It is now reported that the Department has drafted a "Jiangsu Province Drought Relief and Post-Disaster Emergency Work Relief Plan," which Director Shen took to Beijing yesterday. It is divided into two parts: A. Water Conservancy Matters; B. Agricultural Matters. The water conservancy matters include six river projects to be renovated and dredged, requiring 15 million yuan. The agricultural matters include building warehouses and supplementing rural sidelines, requiring 2.5 million yuan. The total is 17.5 million yuan, and it is proposed to request the central government to allocate funds for implementation. The plan is as follows:</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Projects (Omitted Above): The drought problems in Jiangnan are not uniform. In the counties downstream of Taihu Lake, the problem lies in the blockage of the tailwaters, with no unobstructed major channels for flood discharge. Moreover, the entrances connecting to the Yangtze River and lakes are mostly elevated. In the dry season, there is no way to smoothly inject water sources. When rainfall is abundant and mountain floods rise together with the rivers and lakes, they overflow and cause major disasters. Therefore, the strategy for governing the eastern part should focus on dredging the Wusong River and building sluice gates at various entrances along the river, with dredging as the most urgent task. The Grand Canal from Zhenjiang to Suzhou is increasingly silted up. The section from Zhenjiang to Changzhou is even more elevated, making it difficult to both store and discharge water. Farmland transportation is also affected. Sluice gates should be built according to the varying elevation of the terrain to raise the water level and deepen the dredging to smooth the water flow. The people along the river have been hoping for governance for a long time and should be implemented as soon as possible. The Danyang and Jintan areas also need to dredge major rivers. The Jiangning, Jurong, and Lishui areas have suffered severe disasters for years due to the silting of Chishan Lake and the blockage of the Qinhuai River. The impact is sufficient to affect the capital. This time, the drought disaster could not be remedied due to the Qinhuai River's dry up. Dredging should be carried out as soon as possible, regardless of the scale of the project. In high-lying areas, the original mountain ponds are all shallow and small. Most of them have dried up this year and cannot draw water. They should be deepened and widened as soon as possible. At the same time, more artesian wells should be opened to increase water sources. This is the governance strategy for the Jiangnan area. This year, the counties along the Tongyang Canal also suffered from drought. Nantong, Taixian, and other counties have all requested relief. The river is an important transportation route in the Lixiahe area. The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau is now undertaking surveys. It should be dredged together to benefit farmland. In addition to opening ponds and digging wells as local dredging projects, with work funds allocated and handled by each county, about six places should request the central government to allocate funds and raise funds for implementation.</p>
<p>Agricultural Matters: In addition to establishing warehouses, the government should allocate funds to supplement rural sidelines to subsidize farmers' income. The following are the proposed measures and estimated costs: "Building New-Style Warehouses": Among the 61 counties in the province, except for four counties that have already built new-style warehouses, each of the remaining 57 counties should build a new-style warehouse, requiring a total construction cost of approximately 1.57 million yuan. The purpose is to store food and seeds for famine relief and sowing, to handle food mortgages to prevent low grain prices from harming farmers in good years, and to regulate the rural economy. The purchase of grain seeds and mortgage funds will be raised by the local government. "Supplementing Rural Sidelines": (1) Sericulture: "Subsidizing Autumn Silkworm Seed Prices": It is proposed to allocate 160,000 yuan to subsidize seed prices so that the selling price of autumn silkworm seeds can be further reduced by 25 cents per sheet to facilitate promotion. (This province expects to plant about 640,000 sheets of autumn seeds this year. Reducing the selling price by 25 cents per sheet requires 160,000 yuan.) "Establishing a Model Silk Factory": It is proposed to establish a model silk factory in Wuxi, purchase new-style machinery, and study reeling methods as a model for private silk factories. The estimated costs are as follows: A. Building factory buildings, silk reeling factories, silk returning factories, inspection rooms, warehouses, offices, dormitories, and other ancillary rooms, totaling approximately 220,000 yuan. B. Purchasing machinery: multi-position vertical silk reeling machines, 20-end reeling (450 units), silk returning machines (360 units), cocoon boiling machines (3 units), inspection machinery (2 sets), boiler engines, water storage ponds, etc., totaling approximately 220,000 yuan. The total of the above two items is 440,000 yuan. Together with the subsidy for autumn silkworm seed prices, the total is 640,000 yuan. "Animal Husbandry": It is proposed to allocate 200,000 yuan to establish a livestock breeding farm in Zhenjiang to breed a large number of improved breeds of poultry and livestock for promotion. After its establishment, the recurring expenses should be self-sufficient from the production income. "Freshwater Aquaculture": In 25 counties such as Kunshan, an average of 6,000 yuan should be allocated to each county, totaling 150,000 yuan, to develop large-scale aquaculture farms. The estimated cost is 50,000 yuan. ) 26th (</p>

<p>Shanyang is located near the coast. Recently, due to scarce rainfall, a drought has formed. The Fuxing Township Improvement Association in the area sent a telegram to the county government, stating that there had been no rainfall in the area since the previous day, rivers and lakes had dried up, and the soil had cracked. Rice seedlings were sown in the township at the appropriate time, but due to the severe drought, the unplanted soil was hard and could not be sown, and the planted areas lacked sufficient moisture, resulting in a disaster where everything was lost. A total of 227 households in the township were affected, with 3,055 mu of farmland. They requested that personnel be sent to investigate and that grain taxes be exempted, and that drought relief measures be quickly planned. After receiving the report, the county government ordered the Eighth District Office to investigate and report.</p>

<p>In Suzhou, in the past two weeks, the general public has risen up like a swarm of bees to hold temple fairs to pray for rain. The ceremonial guards are changing every day, and the Guanqian Street area is extremely crowded every day. Wang Bolin, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, fearing that it would affect local public order, ordered his subordinates to ban welcoming gods and temple fairs from yesterday (26th). In addition, local gentry Li Genyuan and others had previously invited the Lingguan Guanyin from Guangfu Township to pray for rain, and enshrined it in the Baolian Temple in Sanliuwai. It is now scheduled to be sent back to the township at the end of this month, and a grand farewell ceremony will be held at that time. Since the rain a few days ago, the green seedlings in the fields of the four townships have gradually awakened, but the autumn harvest is bound to be reduced.</p>

<p>Ren Ahe, the son-in-law of the woman who looks after the Zunxian Temple in Huishan Town, outside the West Gate, used to sell sesame cakes for a living. He had three sons, and the family's expenses all depended on Ahe's support. Recently, Ahe's business has been slow, and his livelihood has been difficult to maintain. He developed a sense of world-weariness and committed suicide by swallowing raw opium yesterday morning. In the afternoon, the toxicity took effect. After it was discovered, Xi Shi immediately called for Western doctor Jin Ziying to treat him, but it was too late. He died at around 3 pm. The local branch reported to the local branch of the 26th Picture (local administrative unit) Zheng Jiang Zixian, and the Shen Prosecutor was sent to inspect the body before it was collected.</p>

<p>The Public Security Bureau's Inspectorate received a confidential report yesterday that No. 22 Hengjie Street inside the West Gate was a well-known organization for selling opium pills. The Chief Inspector Wang personally led police officers to search the premises and arrested Lu Afu, Cao Baoliang, and Zhang Miao, the sister-in-law of Zhang Jianying, the main criminal selling opium pills, and four other addicts, including Liu Chen. Together with 200 gray opium pills, 30 red pills, six iron boxes for placing pills, they were all taken to the bureau and sent to the county government for disposal. Also, yesterday, the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau arrested Peng Zhang, a known seller of opium pills, and Wu Ashun, a customer, in Chenbaitou Alley. They were all sent to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>The local county government, because the protection team's funding was not available, submitted to the provincial government in August last year to levy fees on ships and cars along with tickets, originally for a period of one year. It has been a year since the end of this month. According to the central government's circular, this type of taxation that hinders transportation is also exempted from the list of excessive and miscellaneous taxes. Now, the county government has decided to suspend the levy of all taxes from August 1 this year to reduce the burden on the people. In addition to separate orders, a notice is issued to inform everyone.</p>

<p>Since the drought has caused a disaster, although there has been timely rain, it is still insufficient. Locusts have risen in the four townships one after another, spreading wider and wider. They have now been discovered in Huayu Township. The town mayor reported to the district and then to the county, and ordered farmers to find ways to eliminate them. The Drought Prevention Association is still working hard on drought prevention and has purchased 24 water pumpers and five machines. Two are placed in Huadong Huaxi, and one is placed in Lujia Bridge to pump water. Because Yingtian River is still not smooth, Chengchang Small Wheels and ships are still difficult to operate. Waterway traffic can only be restored when the river water rises another two feet.</p>

<p>Lingdian Town in this county is known for its opium pills. The County Public Security Bureau has arrested Cao Hengsan and others for handling the case, but it has not reduced its color. Zhou Zhiqing, a resident of the town, is a well-known opium pill peddler. He serves as a water police patrol leader and colludes with the Xin Renhe shipping company to transport opium pills, and it is not the first time. At 3 pm on the 22nd of this month, Zhou and three prostitutes, including Xiaohong, opened the lights in Lin's house to smoke pills. While they were in the midst of inhaling and exhaling smoke, the resident police station suddenly arrested Zhou and Wu San, the pimp, and took more than 200 red pills and the pill paraphernalia to the station. Patrol Officer Zhou Mingyi personally escorted them to the Third Branch Bureau. After the bureau chief's preliminary interrogation of the origin of the pills, they all shirked responsibility. They are now hunting down Xiaohong Lin for strict investigation. It is said that some people in Lingdian Town are trying to find ways, and a certain lawyer has agreed to secretly dredge up the case. However, the branch chief insists on strict investigation and plans to send the case to the county for handling today.</p>

<p>Actively Promoting the Silk Industry to Stabilize Market Prices</p>
<p>Workers Regularly Petition Party and Government Departments</p>
<p>Since the European and American silk markets have been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk, causing the price of Chinese silk to plummet repeatedly, the factories in the city that have started work will shut down again due to unsustainable losses. A reporter from Dagongshe continued to inquire about the recent situation from relevant parties yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e116">Implementing Relief <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu previously received reports from both labor and management in the city's silk reeling industry, stating that the silk industry was in danger and would go bankrupt, and requested that the reports be forwarded to the central government for prompt relief. He immediately instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the situation of the silk industry and report back for verification. After receiving the order, the bureau has repeatedly convened the silk industry to inquire about the details and has prepared relief measures to report to the municipal government. After receiving the report, Mayor Wu believed that the decline of the silk industry was indeed a fact, and that implementing relief was imperative. He also formulated short-term and long-term measures to save the silk industry and forwarded them to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry for review.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Promoting Sales Abroad <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>In order to fundamentally save the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the Ministries of Finance and Industry have prepared relief measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, promoting sales abroad is very important. In the past, the foreign trade of Chinese silk has been controlled by foreigners. Even if some Chinese businessmen operate, they are all weak in capital and have no way to promote sales. In the future, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai Municipality will cooperate with silk manufacturers and the financial community to organize a Chinese silk sales company. The head office will be located in Shanghai, and branch offices will be established in New York, Lyon, London, India, and other places to enable Chinese silk to be directly exported and sold. At the same time, the situation of domestic silk manufacturers and the rise and fall of overseas silk markets can also be communicated. Regarding these measures, the relevant parties will be responsible for convening relevant parties to discuss them in the near future. If it is deemed necessary to control, various control measures may be implemented.</p>

<p>The silk manufacturers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai held a joint meeting in Shanghai a few days ago to stabilize silk prices. It was decided to jointly organize an evaluation committee with the financial community, electrical machinery and silk weaving industry, and competent authorities, and Shen Huachen, Jiang Laixian, and Qin Youhe were appointed as external liaison representatives to solicit opinions from all parties. It is reported that the representatives are conducting separate investigations in the past few days. However, since Cai Shengbai, chairman of the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association, has left Shanghai on official business, a formal meeting will be convened after Cai returns to Shanghai to discuss stabilizing silk prices and ensure that silk manufacturers can maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>The silk reeling industry unions in the third, fourth, and sixth districts of the city are deeply concerned that the sharp drop in silk prices has led to indefinite shutdowns of silk factories in various districts, and that the factories that have started work will shut down again, making the livelihoods of more than 80,000 workers precarious. In addition to jointly submitting a request to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government a few days ago for prompt relief, they have also appointed Chen Xiupu, Yuan Yunlong, Yang Gengti, Yang Shumei, and others to regularly petition party and government agencies. When necessary, they will go to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting immediate relief to prevent workers from taking desperate measures.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Anhui Rice Merchants Association in Shanghai Requests Postponement of Foreign Rice Purchases <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Listing Four Advantages and Disadvantages of Ordering Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Please Don't Be Deceived by Rice Merchants in the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Anhui Rice Merchants Association in Shanghai has requested the Executive Yuan to postpone the previous proposal to purchase a large batch of foreign rice tax-free, as rice merchants are using drought relief as an excuse, but the provinces along the Yangtze River have had rain in the past month and a bumper harvest is expected. There is no need to order foreign rice. The original text is as follows: To Wang, President of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been dry and the price of rice has soared. The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association has resolved to take both stopgap and fundamental measures, restricting the price of rice on the one hand and requesting the authorities to order 100,000 shi of foreign rice tax-free on the other hand to avoid high grain prices harming the people. The intention is not bad, but in recent days, most of the provinces along the Yangtze River have had rain and a bumper harvest is expected. The price of rice has fallen. It can be seen that the previous skyrocketing was actually caused by speculation, not a real gap between supply and demand. This is the first point. Moreover, ordering foreign rice is still a matter of raising funds from merchants. If there is no profit to be made, who would make this sacrifice? This is the second point. It is still remembered that a few months ago, there was a request to the government to increase the import tax rate on foreign rice. Now, not only is there a request to order it, but also a request for tax exemption. Once the new grains enter the market, foreign rice will pour in at the same time, and low grain prices will harm farmers. This is inevitable. This is the third point. The intention of ordering foreign rice is to suppress the price of rice. Now the price of rice has fallen, and the new grain will be on the market soon, which is enough to prevent speculators from using their skills. This is the fourth point. The association is engaged in this industry and knows the advantages and disadvantages in more detail. It deeply feels that it is not necessary to order foreign rice at this time, and it is feared that it will deepen the danger of rural bankruptcy. If the harvest is not abundant after the autumn harvest, it will not be too late to order foreign rice next spring to make up for the deficiency. The matter concerns the people's food supply. It is appropriate to report the views as seen above. It is hoped that your seat will adopt it and postpone the previous proposal to order foreign rice tax-free to avoid being deceived by those who seek profit and to prevent the countryside from being hit again. The Anhui Rice Merchants Association in Shanghai bows,</p>
<h3 id="e126">Resolution of the Guang Gang and Taikoo Boycott <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Disputes Over Food and Cotton Cloth Lasted for More Than a Year</p>
<p>Both Sides Made Concessions, and Taikoo Paid 30% Compensation</p>
<p>The Export of Xinjiang Vessels Has Resumed Transportation</p>
<p>Since the Guangdong general strike broke out at the British Taikoo Company the year before last, the Cantonese merchants of the grain and cotton cloth gangs have been unable to unload miscellaneous grains and cotton cloth that were stranded in the Taikoo godowns in Guangzhou for a long time, resulting in the spoilage of grain and damage to cloth, and the two gangs suffered losses of more than one million yuan. Later, the two gangs requested Taikoo to compensate them, but Taikoo refused, so the Guang gang boycotted Taikoo ships for more than a year. Now the old case has been re-raised, and the situation has taken a sharp turn. Both sides have made concessions, and Taikoo has acknowledged the losses and agreed to pay compensation. The Cantonese gang has begun to load Taikoo ships. This matter is closely related to the Chinese shipping industry. The situation is described in detail below:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Re-Raising the Old Case <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Guang gang's largest businesses are food, cotton yarn, and headcloth. The British Taikoo Company's fundamental business is the Nanhua line. Since the grain and cloth gang's boycott occurred, Taikoo has been affected in transportation. Recently, in view of the fact that the Sanbei Company has opened four new Nanhua special flights, and the four new ships built by the China Merchants Bureau will soon be able to sail to China, Taikoo Company, at the beginning of this increasingly fierce competition, is seeking to consolidate its shipping business and has re-raised this old case of the boycott and proposed to make concessions and negotiate with the grain and cotton cloth gangs to resolve the conditions and end the boycott. With the consent of both parties, they began to negotiate this matter on Monday of this week.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Resolution of the Dispute <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The yarn and grain gangs had made compensation requests to Taikoo. This matter was first negotiated in Guangzhou and then in Hong Kong. Taikoo considered the amount to be too large and did not agree. Now, they have changed to discussing it in Shanghai. On Monday of this week, representatives of the two gangs and the Taikoo authorities held a long meeting. Finally, both sides made concessions. Taikoo has agreed to pay 30% of the compensation required by the Cantonese gang, and the total amount is said to have reached 270,000 yuan. Yesterday, the reporter asked the Cantonese gang, who acknowledged that this number was correct. The dispute that had lasted for more than a year was brought to an end.</p>

<p>With the resolution of this boycott issue, Taikoo has notified its branches in various ports to load miscellaneous grains and cotton cloth from the Guang gang. On the Shanghai side, starting from yesterday when the Xinjiang vessel sailed to Guangdong, the Guang gang began to load cotton yarn, headcloth, grain, flour, and other items for export.</p>

<p>This city's Journalists Association, regarding the Nanjing Minsheng Daily being ordered to cease publication by the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters, and its president, Mr. Cheng Shewo, being summoned for questioning and not yet released, yesterday (the 26th) at 5 PM, convened a temporary emergency meeting of the executive committee to discuss rescue efforts. Attending were Hang Shi, Yu Kongwo, Xu Chihen, Jiang Zongyi, Qian Cangshuo, Zhao Junhao, Zhai Yicheng, Jin Xiongbo, Sun Enlin, Jiang Jianhou, Jiang Hongjiao, (Wu Zhongdai), Jiang Xiangqing, Tang Shichang, Wang Xinming, Yuan Xiaoyi, Jiang Zongdao, Qu Shao-yi, Qian Hua, Zhu Ping'an, Shao Yizhi, (Jiang Zongdao substituting), Shen Qiuyan, He Xiya (Wang Xinming substituting), a total of twenty-two people. Qian Cangshuo was publicly elected chairman, and Xu Chihen recorded. The following resolutions were made: (1) Send a telegram to the Central Propaganda Committee and the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters; (2) Qu Shao-yi, Qian Cangshuo, and Xu Chihen to draft the telegram, which was sent that evening. The original telegram is recorded below: To the Nanjing Central Propaganda Committee and the Capital Garrison Headquarters: We have just learned from Minsheng Daily that on the 20th of this month, the newspaper was misunderstood by the authorities for publishing a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Wang Jingwei regarding mediation between the two houses. On the 23rd, the Garrison Headquarters ordered it to cease publication and summoned its president, Mr. Cheng Shewo, for questioning, who has not yet been released. The news item in question was originally taken from a National News Agency dispatch, and after inspection, not a single word was deleted or omitted. Moreover, Minsheng Daily was not the only newspaper to publish it. Upon investigation, the news item was taken from a news agency dispatch, was inspected by the news censorship office, and was approved for publication. Furthermore, Minsheng Daily was not the only newspaper to publish the news on the same day. This association has carefully reviewed the news item and found nothing that violates the law. Even if it were inaccurate, it could be handled according to the law. However, the authorities have taken drastic measures without following the legal procedures, which seems to be inconsistent with the spirit of freedom of speech and publication under the Provisional Constitution. As colleagues in the same boat, we specially request your review and (promptly inform the Capital Garrison Headquarters) to release Minsheng Daily president Cheng Shewo in accordance with the law to restore his freedom and protect human rights. We earnestly pray. The Shanghai Journalists Association kowtows.</p>

<p>However, No Third Person Has Been Discovered</p>
<p>Citizens Are Urged to Quickly Get Vaccinated</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather in this city has been extremely hot, and many people have fallen ill. However, these cases are mostly acute gastroenteritis, heatstroke, and other symptoms, so people still feel relatively stable. According to the Health Bureau's investigation, two patients have recently contracted true cholera, which has been confirmed without a doubt. One is Ms. Zhang Lin, residing at 108 West Coal Cinder Road in the South City, who fell ill on the 16th. The other is Zhang Xicai, residing at 51 Weituoma Road in the Public Concession, who fell ill on the 17th. As of yesterday, no third person has been found to have contracted the disease. However, now that true cholera has been discovered, all citizens should take care of themselves and quickly go to the affiliated organizations of the Health Bureau and the health departments of the two concessions to get cholera vaccinations to prevent any possible outbreak. It is also heard that the infectious disease hospital recently established by the City Health Bureau has prepared wards specifically for treating true cholera.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported that, according to information obtained by a certain organization in this city, the Soviet Union is aiming to wage war against Japan and is currently rushing to build a new 50,000-cubic-meter airship. Once completed, the airship will be used to bomb Japan nationwide. Its speed is 100 kilometers per hour, and its aviation range (without the need to replenish fuel) is 7,000 kilometers. The airship will soon be deployed to the Vladivostok Air Force.</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan Is Now Responsible for Supervision</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department No Longer Sends Personnel to Participate</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, after the Central Standing Committee resolved to send personnel to supervise the inventory of antiquities from the Old Palace Museum stored in Shanghai, the Municipal Party Department of this city was ordered to appoint Wu Xiu, Cai Hongtian, Du Mengsen, Lin Kecong, Tang Tie, Shen Moseng, and others to be responsible for the matter. Due to difficulties in finding appraisal experts, it took several twists and turns to begin the inventory. Later, because there were only two jewelry experts, and various other antiquities could not be appraised, and due to various other difficulties, the inventory was suspended after only five days. However, at that time, the board of directors of the museum had been formally reorganized and established. The Municipal Party Department believed that since the board of directors was responsible, it was necessary to request instructions from the central government as to whether the Party Department should still send personnel to supervise. According to news from the Municipal Party Department, the central government, based on the Municipal Party Department's report on the difficulties encountered and whether personnel should be sent to supervise, sent a letter to the museum's board of directors to handle the matter accordingly. The board of directors considered President Ma's proposed method to be quite comprehensive and resolved to request the Executive Yuan to send one person from Shanghai and two persons from Beijing to supervise. A letter was sent to the central government in reply. Therefore, the Secretariat of the central government notified the Municipal Party Department of this city of the previous situation. Therefore, when the antiquities from the Old Palace Museum stored in Shanghai are inventoried in the future, the Municipal Party Department will no longer send personnel to participate in the supervision. As for the news report a few days ago that party and government agencies were still sending personnel to inspect the items, it is entirely unfounded or a misreport of a court inspection.</p>

<h3 id="e135">The Issue Between the Municipal Council and Rickshaw Owners Is Becoming Increasingly Serious <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw Owners Association to Hold General Meeting Today</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter Requesting Attention to the Case</p>
<p>Municipal Council Declares No Change in Attitude</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, after the Public Concession Municipal Council's Rickshaw Management Committee issued new regulations for licensing, the rickshaw owners petitioned for improvements due to the difficulties in implementation. The Management Committee did not allow this. Hua Dong Yu Qiaqing and Jiang-Huai Fellow Townsmen Association Cheng Xiechun, considering that the rickshaw industry is related to the livelihood of 100,000 civilians, warned that if problems were to arise, they would inevitably lead to disturbances. Together, they requested the Management Committee to extend the deadline to allow for proper planning, but this was rejected by the Management Committee. Therefore, the two sides have formed a stalemate. According to the Municipal Council's Information Office, the Municipal Council has received applications from new rickshaw owners for licenses. However, according to the Xinsheng News Agency's investigation, even with a license issued by the Public Concession alone, it is impossible to obtain approval from the Concession's Chinese authorities. In fact, it is still difficult to operate. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Association Requests Assistance from Various Organizations, According to the Xinxin News Agency, the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association's Special District Office yesterday, regarding the Public Concession Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Management Committee's implementation of new regulations, separately submitted petitions to the Taxpaying Chinese Association, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Jiang-Huai Fellow Townsmen Association, and various fellow townsmen associations, requesting them to forward letters to the Board of Directors of the Bureau, requesting that the treatment be improved during the reconsideration of the new regulations, as a final remedy. The original letter stated: We respectfully inform you that the former Rickshaw Committee of the Municipal Council made sixteen reform proposals for the rickshaw industry. The Board of Directors resolved thirteen of these, establishing a Rickshaw Affairs Management Committee, which would make various changes to the licensing procedures for the rickshaw industry. Our association has repeatedly sent representatives to petition, requesting that the difficulties of merchants be considered, but this was not approved. The Taxpaying Association also sent a letter to the Bureau, requesting that it be given serious consideration. Recently, Hua Dong Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Cheng Xiechun, a standing committee member of your association, went to discuss the matter in person, requesting an extension of the deadline, but to no avail. In this way, without any regard for whether the rickshaw industry can be maintained, the Bureau is determined to have its own way. Its destructive policies, such as reforming the rickshaw design, reducing rickshaw fares, collecting monthly mutual aid fees, and abolishing the right to inherit licenses, have been announced to take effect from August 1st, causing rickshaw owners' businesses to be unsustainable. In that case, the livelihoods of over 100,000 rickshaw pullers and their families in this city will inevitably be ruined, and the public order in the concession will be seriously affected. If this is extended from the rickshaw industry to other industries, wouldn't all Chinese merchants in the Public Concession who have licenses be in danger? Our association has already submitted a petition to the Board of Directors of the Bureau, requesting reconsideration. In addition to sending separate letters requesting assistance, we have always admired your association as the leader of our hometown, upholding justice. Therefore, we have specially attached a copy of the reasons for requesting reconsideration, and we respectfully request that you consider our suffering and approve another letter to the Board of Directors of the Bureau, requesting that the treatment be improved during the reconsideration, as the final relief, so as to avoid bankruptcy. Not only will the rickshaw industry and the hundreds of thousands of rickshaw pullers be fortunate, but also the protection of various industries will be significant. We hope for your understanding.</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce writes to the Municipal Council, The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has received a report from representatives of the Rickshaw Industry Association, stating that the Public Concession's regulations for managing the rickshaw industry are seriously detrimental to the industry and the lives of over 100,000 rickshaw pullers and their families, as well as the rickshaw manufacturing industry. According to the association's proposals: (1) Rickshaw licenses should be issued according to the Rice Industry Association's method, in order to save the Municipal Council's expenses and reduce the burden on taxpayers. (2) The rickshaw industry should be changed into a specialized public utility, with corresponding rights and obligations. (3) If the Municipal Council's duty is to provide relief to rickshaw pullers, it should start by maintaining the rickshaw industry. If the current proposed method is implemented, the rickshaw industry will inevitably cease to exist, and the rickshaw pullers who rely on this livelihood and their families, numbering over 100,000 people, will also be in despair. Based on this, the City Chamber of Commerce has forwarded a letter to the Municipal Council, requesting that attention be paid to the case.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owners to Hold General Meeting Today The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association's Special District Rickshaw Owners' General Meeting issued a notice stating: Regarding the implementation of the new licensing regulations by the Rickshaw Management Committee of the Municipal Council from August 1st, which is destroying the rickshaw industry and pushing it to the brink of bankruptcy, we have repeatedly received requests from various rickshaw owners. Our office has repeatedly sent personnel to explain the difficulties of the rickshaw industry, hoping for improvements. We have also submitted a petition to the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council for reconsideration, and have appealed to the City Chamber of Commerce, the Taxpaying Chinese Association, and various industry organizations to provide assistance. However, until yesterday, the Board of Directors' proposal on this case still yielded no results. As the licensing period is approaching, a special emergency general meeting of rickshaw owners will be convened at 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's auditorium, located at Tianhou Palace Bridge, to jointly discuss licensing methods. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper, we specially notify your members to check and immediately inform all rickshaw owners to attend the discussion. The matter is urgent, so we hope that you will attend the meeting at that time. This is to notify you.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Issues News According to the news released by the Municipal Council's Information Office, the Municipal Council recently announced that a large number of rickshaw owners have not complied with the Bureau's regulations to apply for rickshaw owner certificates. If they fail to apply by the deadline, the licenses will be suspended or new people will be recruited to take over. After the rickshaw owners' association petitioned, the deadline for applying for rickshaw owner certificates was extended to July 30th. However, after the extension, not many people have applied. At the same time, the Rickshaw Affairs Committee announced that if the number of applications from existing rickshaw owners is insufficient, the committee will receive new applications from July 25th to 29th, or existing rickshaw owners who are willing to comply with the regulations and want to expand their business may also apply. As of the evening of the 25th, the committee had received 1,581 applications, with a total of 12,641 licenses applied for. Applicants, whether individuals or companies, have stated that they are willing to abide by all new regulations. When distributing licenses in the future, those who are willing to cooperate in promoting the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association plan will be given priority.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Relief Association's Attitude Furthermore, according to the Municipal Council's Information Office, approximately 2,000 rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession, in the name of the Rickshaw Pullers' Relief Association, jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee, expressing their unanimous support for the committee's reform plan. The petition stated, "Regarding the methods agreed upon by your committee: (1) From August 1st, rickshaw fares will be reduced to 10 cents, plus a 1-cent relief fee, for a total of 11 cents for two shifts per day. (2) From January 1st of next year, fares will be further reduced to 8 cents, plus a 1-cent relief fee, for a total of 9 cents (3) Free registration will be handled by the Relief Association. The above points are approved by the association and unanimously supported by 2,000 representatives. However, the rickshaw style will be determined by your committee. In short, regarding any undertaking that benefits our rickshaw pullers, we rickshaw pullers pledge to be your strong support. We also request that your committee send someone to take charge and lead so that the Relief Association can be established as soon as possible. We are deeply grateful." The rickshaw pullers also sent representatives to the committee to explain everything and express their attitude.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Shanghai Representative Returns from National Traffic Police Improvement Conference <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Li Mu Discusses Conference Details</p>
<p>In order to unify and improve traffic police administration nationwide, the Ministry of Interior recently convened a National Traffic Police Conference in Beijing. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau specially sent Secretary Li Mu to attend. Mr. Li returned to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Li to inquire about the conference proceedings. According to Mr. Li,</p>
<p>Participants in the conference included representatives from the public security bureaus of Hubei, Fujian, Guangdong, Shandong, Hebei, Zhejiang, and other provinces, as well as representatives from the public security bureaus of Tianjin, Beijing, Qingdao, Hankou, Shanghai, and other cities, and representatives from the Capital Police Department, totaling thirty-two people. Li Songfeng, Director of the Police Administration Department of the Ministry of Interior, presided over everything. There were three general meetings and three review meetings, and the results were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Key Conference Issues Mr. Li also said that there were a total of thirty-two proposals, divided into four groups: organization, training, command, and reorganization. As the traffic industry is developing rapidly, traffic police administration is becoming more important. Therefore, the representatives were very attentive during the discussions. The two most important cases were the unified command and traffic knowledge training. Regarding the first case, because the traffic control agencies in various places were not unified, various difficulties often arose. Therefore, in the future, the Ministry of Interior will request the central government to instruct all provinces and cities to have traffic control handled by the police administration agencies. As for the traffic knowledge training case, it will be divided into two steps: one for the traffic police to start with, and one for the public to start with. On the public side, film propaganda will be used and incorporated into textbooks. It is also planned to hold a safety week so that the general public can understand traffic issues.</p>

<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Sent Personnel to Inspect and Test the Machines Yesterday</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai Drought Prevention Committee, the municipal government allocated 60,000 yuan to be managed by the Social Affairs Bureau to purchase water pumps from Xintong Trading Company, Shenchang Trading Company, Dahua Machinery Factory, and Shanghai Machinery Factory. The pumps have been distributed to Gaohang, Luhang, Tangqiao, Pusong, Yinxian, Zhenru, Yangsi, Yangjing, and other rural areas for application. On the 22nd of this month, the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel, together with the municipal commissioners of various districts and workers from the companies selling the machines, to install the machines and water pumps in various rural areas. However, due to the extreme difficulty of transportation in various districts of Pudong, although efforts were made to proceed, the installation was only completed yesterday. The machines were immediately tested, and the results were excellent. Water was discharged in the Tangqiao and Pusong districts yesterday. Water will also be discharged in other districts today. The Social Affairs Bureau specially sent staff members Tian Heqing, Shen Risheng, Wang Shuji, Li Chongpu, Qian Hongji, and others yesterday, together with Yu Zhenhui of the Municipal Farmers' Association, to inspect the test run in various districts.</p>
<h3 id="e144">After the Successful Loan for the Yuping Railway, the Contract Has Been Agreed Upon and Will Soon Be Signed <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Representative of the Lending Syndicate Is the Bank of China</p>
<p>The Loan Will Be Repaid Within Five Years After the Completion of the Railway</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways and other institutions mortgaged 16 million yuan of the First Phase Railway Construction Bonds and Yuping Railway Bonds, each worth 12 million yuan, to the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and other banks in Shanghai, as well as the Four Banks Savings Association. Half of this amount, 8 million yuan, will be used as a guarantee for merchants purchasing building materials for the Yuping Railway. The interest rate is 7.5%. The loan will be repaid within five years after the completion of the railway. The draft contract has been signed. As for the formal contract, revisions have been agreed upon, and it will be signed by the Bank of China, the representative of the syndicate formed by the borrowing banks, and the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Railways, the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and the merchants purchasing materials.</p>
<h3 id="e145">City Chamber of Commerce Revises Rules for Accepting Cases <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating: Regarding the petition for the matter, Article 3, Section 2, of the Chamber's articles of association stipulates: "For items 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the preceding paragraph, fees may be charged at the discretion of the local competent government after approval by the local competent government." Article 9, Section 10, states: "When members entrust the Chamber of Commerce to handle items 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of Article 3 of these articles of association, they shall enjoy the right to free or reduced fees." According to the above provisions, only events handled by members can be free or reduced fees, and non-members should pay, so as to distinguish between them. Therefore, according to this purpose, eleven rules for accepting cases were drawn up in September 1930. For non-members requesting handling of events, the amount of fees was determined, and a report was submitted to your Bureau for record in the same year in September and implemented since then. In light of the situation, the original office fee of 30 yuan per case was fixed, and the amount was lost, and facts inevitably hindered it. Also, if the requester's own business already has a public association organization, the reason is to join the industry association in accordance with Article 7 of the Law on Industry Associations. If they are allowed to directly pay the fee when something happens and entrust the Chamber to handle it, it is tantamount to supporting that they do not need to join the association, which is also inconsistent with the provisions of Article 7 of the law. It was then proposed to summarize the meaning of Article 9 under the original text of Article 5 of the rules for non-members requesting events, and modify it to be reviewed by the Chamber. If the industry does not have a public association organization and cannot legally join the public association, and the request does belong to the scope of commercial affairs, the Chamber may charge office expenses at its discretion and handle it on its behalf. The original text of Article 9 was deleted, and the original text of Article 6 was added under "30 yuan per case", adding "However, in special circumstances, a reduction may be considered after verification. If the event is too cumbersome, it may be increased at the discretion of the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, and the original text of Article 7 is merged into the footnote of that article to save space." The full text of nine articles was discussed, revised, and passed at the fourth Executive Committee meeting on July 23, and is now copied in full and submitted to your Bureau for review and approval for record, which is a public convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Revision of Transportation Contract for Tongji Company by Two Railways <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi Tongji Tugboat Company previously entered into a contract with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to undertake the loading and unloading of railway-transported goods at the Wuxi railway riverbank, paying an annual wharfage fee of two hundred silver dollars. This contract expired on November 30th of the seventeenth year (of the Republic). The company continued to pay the wharfage fee without ceasing. Now, the Railway's Transportation Department, considering the actual needs, revised the contract terms item by item, submitted them to the Railway Bureau for approval, and signed the following terms on June 30th of this year: (1) The Railway Bureau allows the company to use railway-registered vessels to load and unload railway-transported goods at the Wuxi railway riverbank, but the company shall not obstruct other merchants or individuals from using their own vessels to load and unload their own goods at the riverbank. (2) The company shall have forty fully equipped tugboats and ten reserve boats, all of which must be registered with the Railway Bureau. An annual registration fee of five silver dollars per boat shall be paid, totaling two hundred and fifty yuan, to be paid in full upon the establishment of the contract. The above-mentioned boats shall be inspected by the Railway Bureau, and licenses shall be issued and affixed in a conspicuous place on the boats, not to be defaced, so that the Railway Bureau can inspect them at any time. (3) The company's rates for loading and unloading goods shall not exceed those stipulated by local businesses of the same type. Upon the establishment of the contract, the rates shall be submitted to the Railway Bureau for approval and publication. Once published, the company shall not arbitrarily change them. If changes are necessary, the company shall obtain the consent of the Railway Bureau. Outside the stipulated rates, the company shall not solicit anything from customers. If there is any solicitation, the Railway Bureau shall be free to impose penalties. (4) The company shall strictly abide by all existing and future regulations issued by the Railway Bureau and shall be responsible for guaranteeing the conduct of all its employees within the railway premises. (5) The company shall provide a security deposit of one thousand national currency dollars and a guarantee from a reputable firm, to be deposited with the Railway Bureau as a guarantee of compliance with this contract. This guarantee and security deposit shall be returned in full by the Railway Bureau upon the termination of the contract if the company has not violated any terms. (6) If the Railway Bureau believes that the company has any matters for improvement or reform, it may notify the company in writing. If the company fails to comply, the Railway Bureau may cancel the contract at any time. (7) The company shall be responsible for protecting any buildings of the Railway Bureau. If there is any damage, compensation shall be paid according to the value. (8) The benefits stipulated in this contract shall not be transferred without the written consent of the Railway Bureau. The Railway Bureau shall not issue licenses that conflict with the benefits of this contract to others during the valid term, in order to maintain the benefits. (9) This contract shall come into effect on July 1st of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China and shall be valid for ten months. If both parties have no objections upon expiration, it may be extended. However, this shall not apply where the terms are otherwise specified. (10) This contract shall be made in duplicate originals, with the Railway Bureau and the company each holding one copy for compliance. A duplicate copy shall also be kept by the Railway Bureau's Chief Audit Office for verification.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reports that Chief Inspector Pellami, a key figure in the incident involving Japanese sailors in Hongkou on June 27th, was found by the investigative committee to have neglected his duties. He was suspended for one month, had his salary docked, and lost six months of eligibility. He has now been transferred to the Central District Police Station to resume his duties. As for the report of the investigative committee, at the meeting of the Municipal Council yesterday (the 25th), it was only mentioned that if the councilors wished to read it, they could do so in the General Office. No other mention was made of this case, and since the next council meeting is not scheduled until September, it is unlikely to be published.</p>

<p>Measures Drafted by the Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>Many pawnbroking businesses in the city, both large and small, have closed down recently due to declining business and inability to sustain themselves. Those that have not closed are also struggling. The Municipal Government, considering that the pawnbroking business is related to the economic adjustment of the poor and that its closure would affect the livelihood of the poor and social stability, has proposed relief measures. The Bureau of Social Affairs has now drafted a relief plan and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Municipal Council Cautious in Issuing Driver's Licenses <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Transportation Committee believes that under the current regulations, if a minor applies for a driver's license, they must submit a letter from their parents or guardians expressing their permission and proving that they are at least seventeen years old before a license can be issued. However, this procedure is only a regulation set by the Police Department and is not explicitly stated in the license regulations. Recently, a guardian certificate submitted by a minor applicant was found to be false. Since there is no explicit provision in the regulations, it is difficult to deal with the situation. After discussion, it was decided to add a clause to the driver's license regulations stating that if an applicant knowingly makes a false statement, their license may be withheld or revoked. This proposal was approved by the Board of Directors, and it was stipulated that all applicants for driver's licenses must comply with this clause.</p>

<p>Yangzhou Natives in Shanghai Considering</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the China Bookstore's publication of "Rambling Talk on Yangzhou" by Mr. Yi Junzuo, Director of the Editorial Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, has aroused public anger among the people of Yangzhou. Yangzhou natives residing abroad have organized committees to investigate "Rambling Talk on Yangzhou" in various places in response. Mr. Lu Feikui, General Manager of the China Bookstore, has entrusted a friend to invite lawyer Xue Dubi to mediate. Previously, Mr. Xue visited Shanghai-based Yangzhou lawyer Shan Yuhua and Shanghai-based Yangzhou native Ruan Mubai, stating the China Bookstore's willingness to: 1. Publish an apology to the people of Yangzhou in the newspaper; 2. Stop selling "Rambling Talk on Yangzhou" in the China Bookstore's main store and branches; 3. Donate all proceeds from the sale of "Rambling Talk on Yangzhou" to purchase summer medicines for distribution in Yangzhou; 4. Donate several types of books published by the China Bookstore to the Yangzhou Library. However, Shan Yuhua and Ruan Mubai believe that the matter is significant and that it would be difficult to accept the mediation terms without the consent of all the Yangzhou natives. They only agreed to submit the proposed mediation terms to the Yangzhou Eight Counties Association in Shanghai. At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Yangzhou Eight Counties Association in Shanghai convened a meeting of committee members to discuss the matter. Those present included Shen Dingchen, Hou Dachun, Song Shixiang, Li Zhixi, Jiao Dingkai, Hua Zhijing, Qian Shusheng, Liu Yongque, Hang Shijun, Zhu Xinong, Qian Cangshuo, Ai Guofan, Ruan Mubai, Ruan Lianzhong, etc. After discussion, it was decided to submit the mediation terms proposed by the China Bookstore to the Yangzhou natives' committee in Shanghai investigating the book "Rambling Talk on Yangzhou" for detailed consideration. The committee is scheduled to convene all committee members at 8:00 PM today to discuss the mediation terms proposed by the China Bookstore in detail.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that after the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association notified its members to register and pay taxes as required, according to information from the Finance Bureau yesterday, a considerable number of tobacco and alcohol merchants have reported to various tax collection offices to apply for licenses in recent days. However, the tax collection offices must send personnel to review and verify whether the types of businesses reported are consistent. If they are, licenses can be issued immediately. If there are discrepancies, the merchants should be corrected separately in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax. The merchants should truthfully report and apply for licenses to avoid disputes and future penalties. The Finance Bureau still adheres to its repeatedly stated position on the collection of this tax. Those who fail to pay taxes and obtain licenses in accordance with the regulations will be strictly enforced and will not be accommodated or reduced in order to avoid violating the law.</p>

<p>Retrial Verdict for Liu Chongwu and Others</p>
<p>Liu Sentenced to Seven Years, Pan and Tian Each Sentenced to Six Years</p>
<p>Cao Songshou Sentenced to Twelve Years for Conspiracy to Murder</p>
<p>Patriotic youths Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, Tian Shuiyang, and others, previously organized a patriotic group in light of the brutality of the Japanese invaders. They sent letters warning Shanghai merchants not to purchase enemy goods, but the result was ineffective. They then carried out intimidation, shooting and killing Wang Zhengtao, the owner of Maotai Foreign Goods Store on Xinza Road, and throwing bombs as a warning. After the incident, the police arrested Liu and the other four and handed them over to the First Special Court, imposing light punishments on each of them. However, the police were dissatisfied and appealed. The Second Branch of the High Court heard the case and sentenced Liu, Pan, and Cao to twelve years of imprisonment each for continuous joint conspiracy to murder, and Tian Shuiyang to six years of imprisonment. The defendants, upon hearing the verdict, declared their dissatisfaction and hired lawyers to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, after carefully examining the case, found that there were still doubts in the case and sent the case back to the Second Branch of the High Court for retrial. The retrial has now concluded, and a sentence was scheduled to be announced. The circumstances of the sentences have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the verdict was announced by President Yu Hua, accompanied by judges Zhao and Jiang. The main text of the verdict reads: The original verdict regarding Liu Chongwu's possession of military firearms and ammunition and the portions concerning Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, and Tian Shuiyang are revoked. Liu Chongwu is sentenced to six months of imprisonment for continuous joint intention to use military firearms and ammunition for criminal purposes, combined with the original sentence for murder, the executed imprisonment shall be seven years. The appeal of the other parts is dismissed. Pan Hongsheng and Tian Shuiyang are each sentenced to six years of imprisonment for assisting in the conspiracy to murder. Cao Songshou is sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for jointly conspiring to murder. The number of days of detention before the judgment is final shall be converted to one day for every two days of imprisonment. Five pistols and forty-four rounds of ammunition are confiscated.</p>
<p>Allow Separation of Good and Bad in Suppressing Street Vendors</p>
<h3 id="e155">Resolution of Street Vendor Dispute <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Local Goods Industry and Market Association Requested the Municipal Council Yesterday</p>
<p>The Local Goods Stores Resumed Business Simultaneously from 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that after the street vendors in this city stopped hawking from the day before yesterday, they also caused trouble near the local goods stores, causing the melons sold by the local goods stores to be unsellable. Yesterday, the Local Goods Industry Association sent four representatives to petition the Municipal Council, and the Standing Committee of the Citizens' Federation also went to the Municipal Council to request the suppression of street vendors by separating good and bad. The authorities agreed to instruct the Police Department to comply. All parties resumed business at 3:00 PM. The details of the process are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e156">Reason for Stopping Hawking <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The street vendors who hawk along the streets, especially those who hawk silk stockings, undershirts, and children's clothing, often work in groups of three or four in places like Fourth Malu, Daxin Street, and Fifth Malu. However, because their business is dishonest, when they encounter simple-minded customers who use large coins to pay, they make excuses and even run away on the pretext of "the police are coming." Therefore, they are unpopular and reported to the police station, requesting suppression. The police authorities immediately dispatched police officers to arrest and punish them indiscriminately, regardless of whether they are good or bad. The street vendors selling fruits are greatly affected because they are carrying heavy loads and have difficulty escaping. This led to the smashing of melons bought by customers near the local goods stores, causing buyers to hesitate. Yesterday morning, these street vendors were still scattered in places such as Lao Zha Bridge and the Sixteen Shops, waiting to carry out their sabotage work. Therefore, the local goods stores at Lao Zha Bridge have all temporarily suspended business. All the river boats carrying melons that have not been loaded have sailed to other places to sell, and those whose goods have already been loaded can only wait for a solution. Boats on the way have also reportedly turned to other places.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Great Losses <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of sixteen local goods stores in Lao Zha, including Long Shun, Qu Futai, Yuji, Yongchang, Yida, Zhengtai, Yuanda, Tongcheng, Longyuanshun, Shengchang, Changtai, Yongshun, Yongchang, Yongsheng, Xieda, and Yujixing. Each store can sell more than 1,500 yuan per day, totaling more than 20,000 yuan per day. There are about 2,000 porters, each earning 2 yuan per day, totaling 4,000 yuan. There are also hundreds of foremen who can earn more than 1,000 yuan per day for unloading and delivering goods. All are greatly affected by the disturbance.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Petition Yesterday Morning <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The local goods stores believe that although they can sustain themselves despite the losses, the porters and foremen rely on their daily income to make a living. If this stalemate continues, it will inevitably lead to incidents. Therefore, they sent representatives Ma Shangde, Cao Quanlin, Zhou Shenyan, and Yang Guanqi as representatives to petition the Municipal Council. The councilor He Dekui received them. After the representatives stated their intentions, Council He immediately stated that the street vendors had also come to request. Therefore, he has now informed the Police Department that if they encounter legitimate businesses, they will be lenient, and it can be resolved in a day or two. The representatives were satisfied and left. This afternoon, the Local Goods Industry Association also issued leaflets to persuade the street vendors to resume business as usual. The Municipal Council has agreed to be lenient and exempt them from prosecution.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Request for Relief <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Street vendor representatives Li Maoting, Geng Dashou, Bao Guizhi, Xue Delong, and others submitted a petition to the First Special District Citizens' Federation yesterday afternoon, requesting relief and making a second petition. Standing Committee member Zhang Yichen received them and agreed to forward the request to the Municipal Council for proper solutions. Zhang Yichen immediately went to the Municipal Council and explained the plight of the street vendors to Councilor He Dekui, emphasizing the need to protect their livelihoods and to strictly suppress the bad elements at any time. Councilor He agreed to convey the message to the chief officer to notify the Police Department to conduct a thorough investigation and suppress them separately. The good street vendors will be treated leniently. Representative Zhang was satisfied and left. He then informed the respective street vendor representatives to resume business as usual to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Resumption of Trade <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Council member He Dekui, after receiving the petition representatives from the local goods industry in the morning and consulting with the chief officer, agreed to be accommodating. He specially summoned both parties for talks. Yang Guanqi, Ma Shangde, Cao Quanlin, and Zhou Shenyan from the local goods industry, and Cai Shuqing, Hong Azu, Xu Agen, and other street vendor representatives, went to the Municipal Council at 2:00 PM to meet with Councilor He Dekui. According to Councilor He, the good street vendors will continue to be treated as usual, and there will be no strict suppression. If unscrupulous elements take the opportunity to use illegal business practices to extort money, the authorities will investigate and severely punish them. The good street vendors can do business with peace of mind. The representatives were satisfied. Therefore, the turmoil subsided at 3:00 PM. The local goods stores resumed business as usual, and the street vendors also hawked their goods without interfering with each other.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Notice of Resumption of Business <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Goods Industry Association hereby notifies all street vendors to resume business immediately. The association has sent representatives to contact the Municipal Council regarding the dispute over the closure of business by various street vendors. The Municipal Council's Council He Dekui stated that the livelihood of street vendors should be taken into account. It is hoped that all law-abiding street vendors will resume business as usual and continue to operate as before, without strict suppression. However, if there are unscrupulous elements who take the opportunity to incite disturbances, the authorities must investigate and punish them severely, which has nothing to do with the good street vendors. Therefore, the case has been resolved satisfactorily. Therefore, this notice is issued to all street vendors, hoping that they will resume business immediately to secure their livelihoods and end the dispute. This is most earnestly hoped for.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the daily necessities industry and all street vendors in this city, through the Second Branch of the First Special District Citizens' Federation, sent a letter to the Police Department of the Public Concession, stating that the street vendors often engage in fraudulent acts and requesting that they be suppressed in order to seek redress. Yesterday, they specially sent representatives Li Maoting and others to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request assistance in order to prevent their livelihood from being cut off. The original letter is excerpted as follows: Due to being unjustly detained and fined, they are unable to operate and their livelihood is on the verge of being cut off, we appeal to your association to uphold justice and provide relief. We have always been engaged in selling daily necessities of national goods as a business, setting up stalls to sell and earn a small profit to maintain our lives and operate lawfully. Recently, the Second Branch of the First Special District Citizens' Federation in Shanghai stated that we cheat and extort money, induce people to buy, and cause disputes, etc., and sent a letter to the Police Department of the Municipal Council to strictly suppress us and evict us. We have investigated that this situation is due to the fact that those who sell children's shirts and silk stockings are rampant in cheating. As for us, we have always been lawful and dare not cheat. Once we encounter a patrolman, we are immediately detained and fined, and some are even fined three or four times a day, so that we cannot do business. Our eight-member family relies on this for a living. If this continues, our hundreds of street vendors and thousands of families will all starve to death. The Citizens' Federation was originally intended to protect the citizens and uphold justice. We are all citizens of Shanghai, but not only have we not been protected, but we have been oppressed. The original letter referred to cheating and extortion, but failed to distinguish between good and bad and added misfortune to us, which is difficult to accept. We believe that our transactions with people are fair in price, and the establishment of a sale is based on the consent of both parties. How can we force it? If there is fraud, the authorities can investigate and punish us according to the law. This kind of action by the association is contrary to law and human feelings. We have been appealing for help since we were driven away. We believe that your association leads the commercial community, advocates justice, and has the purpose of helping the poor and the distressed. We have decided to send Li Maoting, Geng Dashou, Bao Guizhi, Xue Delong, and others as temporary representatives of all the street vendors selling daily necessities of national goods to submit a petition, requesting your audience and allowing the following opinions: (1) Request to forward a letter to the Police Department of the Municipal Council, granting leniency and allowing us to live. (2) Request to order the Second Branch of the First Special District Citizens' Federation to treat all citizens equally in the future. If they express opinions, they should seriously advocate them to avoid criticism and provide for life. We dare to ask you to intercede on our behalf, and we will be grateful for the rest of our lives. We are anxiously awaiting your orders.</p>

<p>Abolition of the Tea Boy System: It has been decided that the tea boy system will be abolished on the four new ships.</p>
<p>Examination for Stewards: One hundred stewards will be hired. Yesterday morning, Wang Secretary, specially dispatched by the Ministry of Communications to supervise the examination, together with Yao Bolong, Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department of the company, held the examination at Junyi School. There were more than 800 applicants. There were seventeen questions, of which one to twelve were very easy. Thirteen asked what the Five-Power Constitution is. Fourteen asked what the New Life Movement advocates. Fifteen asked which places Japan occupies in our country. Sixteen asked what overseas Chinese are.

<p>Two Ship Captains Directly Dispatched by the Company to the UK</p>
<p>Sent to Scotland to return to the country with the first batch of two new ships. According to the contract, the ship will be handed over to the company in Shanghai, so the company does not need to send people to receive it. The two captains, Ma Junchao and Teng Shibiao, who were sent this time, are going to inspect the driving conditions of the new ships along the way, not to receive the ships. They are scheduled to take the Yitai's Green round on the 29th and go straight to England, and then to the Rasgu Shipyard in Scotland, and return to Shanghai with the first two ships in late November.</p>

<p>After the Nanjing Central Research Institute of Astronomy announced the news of the lunar eclipse at 6:54 PM last night (the 26th) on the day before yesterday (the 25th), firecrackers were set off in various parts of this city at nearly 8:00 PM last night, and the sound of firecrackers was like a string of pearls. Paper flowers flew on the streets. The fireworks shop's profits were ten times higher. The eclipse began at 7:03 PM, and the largest portion was eclipsed at 8:15 PM. It returned to its original state at 9:36 PM. This newspaper took a special photo of the eclipse at that time (photo by Qi Changlie).

<h3 id="e166">Hospital Director Disappearance Case Resembles Kidnapping <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>A Car Suddenly Abducted the Director</p>
<p>The Inside Story is Full of Mysteries, the Truth Unknown</p>
<p>The Dongwu Hospital at 99 Jing'an Temple Road was founded by Chen Zhenya. However, in the early stages, due to lack of funds, he required staff to pay a certain amount of guarantee money when recruiting them. Ostensibly called a "guarantee," this money was actually used for starting the hospital and purchasing all necessary equipment. Unexpectedly, since its opening, business has been slow, making it difficult for Chen to maintain the hospital, and he has accumulated debts of over eight thousand yuan. The hospital staff discovered this, and collectively demanded repayment of their guarantee money. Chen Zhenya had no choice but to offset the debt with all the hospital's assets to settle with the staff. However, he was unable to compensate the apprentice guarantee money and the hospital's external creditors. Therefore, the creditors filed a lawsuit in court. Chen also hired lawyer Jin Zhi, who resided in Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao, to handle the case. Meanwhile, the creditors appointed staff to stay in the hospital and monitor Chen's movements. Unexpectedly, at around 7:00 AM yesterday, a Feiyun automobile suddenly sped to the hospital entrance. Three people were inside. After getting out of the car, they went straight into the hospital, claiming to be detectives from the police station, ordered to arrest Chen. They immediately escorted Chen into the car and drove away, appearing flustered and disoriented. The hospital staff became suspicious, especially since the car was not an official police vehicle, which made them believe it was a kidnapping case. They quickly reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, requesting an investigation. After receiving the news, the police station sent detectives to investigate the Feiyun Automobile Company. According to the driver, they had been taken to the entrance of Hengmao Lane, near the Baxianqiao Small Vegetable Market in the French Concession. The police then followed various clues to investigate, but returned without results. Although they inquired at the office of lawyer Jin Zhi in Hengmao Lane, Jin Zhi claimed to know absolutely nothing about it. Therefore, the police believe there is another story behind this case and further investigation and verification is needed.</p>

<p>Meeting Held Yesterday to Report Negotiation Results</p>
<p>The Shishan Lane Rent Reduction Branch of the Sixth District Citizens' Association held a meeting yesterday at 8:00 PM at its clubhouse to discuss with all the tenants. Over 80 people attended, including Qiu Jialiang, Yang Jingcai, and Zhou Fuzhang. Qiu Jialiang was elected as chairman. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and the results of the three negotiations with Xiangmao Foreign Firm. The foreign firm has sent a letter agreeing to a rent reduction with three specific measures: (1) Storefronts along the road will be granted a 20% rent reduction as requested. However, due to different conditions, the rent for residences within the lane will be reduced from 37 yuan to 32 yuan, and from 35 yuan to 30 yuan. But the water bill will be the responsibility of the tenants. (2) Old rent arrears up to April of this year must be paid in full. Any remaining arrears will be paid monthly according to the old and new rates until cleared. (3) The rent reduction period will be from July of this year to the end of June next year. After the expiration, the situation will be reviewed and further consultation will take place. If there were previous deposits made in the bank, each tenant should withdraw the money from the bank to settle the arrears. The tenants considered this satisfactory and unanimously approved it on the spot. The meeting adjourned without discussing other matters.</p>

<p>Son Returns Home from Work</p>
<p>Old Mother Groaning in Bed</p>
<p>The old woman Sun Wang, a native of Funing, residing at No. 201 Dongyouheng Road, is 65 years old. She has three grown sons. The second son, Liansheng, works as a driver in the tram company. His wife, Zhou, is extremely fierce. If the mother-in-law slightly disagrees with her, Zhou would quarrel with her. The day before yesterday, Zhou had a big argument with the mother-in-law over trivial household matters, which was heard by the neighbors. The old woman became increasingly resentful and had the thought of ending her life. She secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. When her son returned home from work at 3:00 PM, he saw his mother groaning in bed. When asked, she did not reveal the truth. So, he took her to Tongren Hospital and then transferred her to Guangren Hospital. The medical treatment was ineffective, and she died. The hospital reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, who ordered Detective Liu Zongcheng to investigate. The body was then moved to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Wei of the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to examine the body. According to Detective Liu Zongcheng's report of the situation, Judge Guo determined that the deceased Liu Wang, a female, had indeed died from opium poisoning before her death. The body was handed over to her son, Sun Liansheng, to be claimed for burial after signing an affidavit.</p>

<p>Detectives Testify to the Case Cracking Circumstances</p>
<p>The Penglai Bank in the Penglai Market of this city was robbed on the morning of May 8th of this year, with more than 500 yuan stolen. Afterwards, team leader Gu Liancheng of the Detective Team, along with detectives Shen Jinchu, Hu Kui Sheng, Ma Wenlin, and others, first arrested the suspect Zhang San and accomplice Ma Qinxiang at the Zhang Mingji's broker store on Nancang Street and took them to the team. After interrogation by Team Leader Lu, it was learned that the accomplices were hiding in room 46 of the Yuelai Hotel in Mantingfang. Therefore, team leader Gu Liancheng again led detectives Shen Jinchu and others disguised as hotel staff, successively arresting a large number of 18 bandits, seizing three pistols, one hand grenade, one axe, one iron chisel, and three rolls of lead wire used for tying people. They were taken to the team and interrogated. The seven bandits who robbed the Penglai Bank were completely apprehended, including Li Ziyun (aka Xiao Genfa), Fan Jinsheng (aka Wei Gengsheng), Zhang San, Yang Xingen, Shen Haishan (aka Shen Xingsheng), Wu Changsheng, and Lu Jinquan (aka Que Genliang). (The Lu offender was taken away by the First Court of the Special District for another case, sentenced to four years, and has not yet been brought back.) Also apprehended were those who robbed Tang Ziyun's property at No. 51 Dasheng Lane on April 30th, the Yichun Company at No. 9 Fuchang Lane, Xiaodongmen on June 9th, Zhang Baosen's house at No. 8 Heng'an Lane at the Nanyang Bridge intersection on June 10th, the Jin family in the Northern Qingyuan Township, Ertu, Nanhui Zhagang, and the bandit Li Yunxiang, Wang A'er, Wang Meiying, Zhu Fa'er, Chen Hongsheng, Chen Guansheng, Guo Bingjin, Huang Liangqing, Ge Yousheng, Chen Alin, Chen Sandi, and Tang Amao who shot and killed Team Leader Zhu of the Nanhui County Public Security Bureau. In total, twenty bandits were apprehended. The bandits confessed that on the night of June 12th, they had discussed in room 46 of the Yuelai Hotel the intention to rob the silver box of the Jiading Bank, which was transported by an old truck. The bandits called the iron box a "steel tortoise". The hand grenade seized, according to the bandits, was to be thrown if pursuers came during the robbery of the "steel tortoise". The detective team recorded the confessions and sent them to the Third Section for transfer to the local court for strict investigation. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang reviewed the case one by one and ordered the suspects to be detained separately. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Lei ordered the team leader Gu Liancheng and detectives Shen Jinchu, Hu Kui Sheng, and Ma Wenlin, who handled the case, to appear in court to testify about the case cracking. He also ordered the suspects Zhang San, Yang Xingen, and others in custody to be brought to court for questioning for a long time. As a result, all the defendants were remanded in custody pending further investigation.</p>

<p>The First Five Letters Were Mistakenly Delivered Due to the Same Address</p>
<p>Cao Shifang's Tobacco Shop Closed Down, Became a Bandit</p>
<p>Zhang Tongjun, a Ningbo native residing at No. 1, First Lane, Xinkang Lane, Yangzhou Road, works as an accounting clerk at the Ewo Yarn Factory. Between the 11th and 17th of this month, he suddenly received five threatening letters signed by the "Iron Blood Corps," demanding 5,000 yuan. However, the letter was addressed to Shen Shengda, the owner of Shen Shengji Construction Company, which Zhang found strange. After finding out that Shen lived at No. 64, Tongli, Yangshupu Road, he secretly reported to the Yulin Road Police Station. Later, Shen Shengda also received two similar letters, reducing the amount from 5,000 yuan to several hundred yuan, and even 50 yuan as the minimum to settle the matter, otherwise, they would take drastic measures. Shen also reported to the police station. At 3:20 AM the day before yesterday, Hua Detective Xie Wanqi and Detective Tang Pengfei were waiting near Shen's residence when they caught Cao Shifang, a local man aged 23, just as he was about to slip a letter through the crack in the door. They arrested him and learned that he lived at No. 132 Taopeng Road. After searching his home, they found a set of letter shells and letter paper of the same size, as well as an inkstone, and took them all to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department stated the facts, saying that the defendant admitted at the police station that he wrote eight threatening letters because Shen lived at No. 1, First Lane, Xinkang Lane, Yangshupu Road, and Zhang Tongjun lived at No. 1, First Lane, Xinkang Lane, Yangzhou Road. The first five were mistakenly delivered, and he only found out later. Currently, the victim Shen Shengda is in Jiangxi and unable to attend the court. He asked for a postponement of the case.</p>
<p>The letter and other evidence were presented for inspection. Then, Zhang Tongjun and Shen's representative Fei Huilin testified. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he had previously opened two tobacco and paper shops, but they had closed down, leaving him with no means to make a living, so he resorted to this strategy and asked for leniency. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered him to be remanded in custody for further review at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Retrial Record of the Chen Hongyu Assassination Case <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Based on the Statements of Various People and the Facts</p>
<p>It Seems that Chen Has No Evidence of Committing a Crime</p>
<p>On the evening of December 15, 1928, at 7:00 PM, Chen Hongyu (aka Xiao Xing) was suddenly shot and killed in the Yinghua Morning Lane on Rubeson Road. Later, the police arrested the suspect Pan Qifang and sent him to court. After interrogation, he was sentenced to death and is currently held in prison, awaiting approval from superiors for execution. However, Pan had previously confessed that Chen Bingquan from Jiangbei was an accomplice who initiated the crime. Therefore, Detective Xiao and Wang Chengying of the Gordon Road Police Station arrested Chen and sent him to court, where he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Chen refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The result was that the appeal was rejected. It is now known that Chen Bingquan's wife, Chen Yan, believed that her husband had been falsely accused and hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a complaint with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court issued an order to remand the case to the Second Branch of the High Court for retrial. Therefore, yesterday morning, President Yu of the High Court, along with judges Zhao and Jiang, sat in the First Criminal Court for the retrial. Attorney Wang Yaotang of the Police Station stated the case, saying that the police investigated Chen Bingquan for the crime of premeditated murder and asked for prosecution. Chen Hongwang's wife, Chen Yan, and sister, Chen Chen, testified that the deceased was at home when Pan Qifang came, called him out, and shot him, but Chen Bingquan was not seen at the scene. The arrested Pan Qifang's confession was ambiguous, not only did he not point to an accomplice, but he even denied committing the crime himself. Witness Chen Bingyang testified that Chen Bingquan was having dinner at his home when the incident happened. When questioned, Chen Bingquan firmly denied conspiring to kill Chen Hongyu. Finally, lawyer Chen Tingrui stood up to argue that based on the statements of the various witnesses and the facts, Chen Bingquan was undoubtedly framed. Since there was no sufficient evidence, he should be declared not guilty and the original verdict should be overturned. President Yu reviewed the statements and ordered Chen to be remanded in custody, pending sentencing on August 2nd.</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Second Special District Citizens' Association Opposes Increasing Water and Electricity Meter Deposits <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Second Special District Citizens' Association held its 26th Executive Committee meeting yesterday at 4:00 PM at the clubhouse at No. 434 Pu Bo Road. More than 10 people attended, including Zhang Gengshan, Wu Guowei, Dong Kechang, He Yuanming, Feng Song, Mao Yun, Huang Xianggu, Wang Deyan, and Zhang Zongyao. Mao Yun was elected chairman, Guo Jingliang recorded. After performing the formalities, the chairman reported on the incoming documents and the progress of the association's affairs. Then, they began discussing (1) A letter from the Second District Branch, stating that the merchants on Avenue Joffre had jointly written a letter saying that they have been affected by the economic downturn in recent years, the market is sluggish, and business is slow. Therefore, the number of businesses that cannot maintain themselves and close down is increasing daily. Unexpectedly, in this time of unheard pleas, they suddenly received a foreign language notice from the French Water and Electricity Company, stating that from July onwards, the fees for water and electricity meter installation and deposits will be increased. They were extremely surprised upon reading it. Water and electricity are public utilities, and their main purpose is to provide convenience to citizens. They are not like other businesses that can seek endless profits. Moreover, in this time of industrial depression, water and electricity still earn millions of yuan annually, yet they are still not satisfied and disregard the suffering of citizens by arbitrarily increasing prices in disguise. The French Municipal Council also failed to understand the current difficulties and observe the people's plight during this time of extreme economic panic and citizen burden, and rashly approved it, which lacks the spirit of cooperation between the authorities and citizens. It is even more regrettable. The merchants will never recognize this unreasonable disguised price increase in water and electricity. Therefore, they report the situation and urge the authorities to argue with the French authorities to revoke this decision, and will not stop until the goal is achieved. Please investigate and decide to send a letter to the French Municipal Council. (2) A letter from the Sixth District Branch, stating that the citizen Tang Gongshi Gan Azhong was killed by a car from the Hefeng Dyeing Factory, and the French police refused to initiate a public prosecution. Please negotiate the case. The decision was to send a letter to the Third Branch of the High Court. (3) The term of office of the Executive Committee of the Second District Branch has expired, and it has not yet been re-elected. How should this be handled? The decision was to send a letter to the branch, limiting them to re-elect before the end of July and report. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

This association sent a letter to the landlord to encourage rent reduction and recently received a reply that the rent would be collected at 88% from January of this year. Considering that the residents of the lane are poor and the rent is high, how should this be handled? It was resolved to send a letter to persuade the landlord to further reduce the rent. (9) Having received the approval of the Municipal Party Department to publish a special issue, it should follow the legal procedures.

How should this be handled? It was resolved that those who oppose or do not want rent reduction when the rent reduction is initiated, after the rent reduction is achieved, the reduced rent will be used to subsidize the landlord's losses or donate to charitable organizations, and the individual will not enjoy or want to enjoy its benefits. (12) Omitted. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

<p>On the sixth of this month, when the Jianguo ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was awaiting orders to launch from the Yangtze River, it towed a large iron barge from Nanjing to Shanghai for repairs. On the seventh, it was towed to outside the Liu River Estuary. Due to strong winds at the mouth of the Yangtze River, the Jianguo ship had difficulty sailing. The iron barge was temporarily unloaded at the port of Liu River, and another ship was planned to tow it. Unexpectedly, after the Jianguo ship left for Shanghai, the iron barge was suddenly reported missing. It had probably been washed away by the wind and waves on the river to another location.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Found in Haimen <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The iron barge was washed away by the strong winds and waves, drifting from outside the port of Liu River to the port of Haimen. At that time, the Haimen Water Police District received a report saying that a large iron barge had drifted from the sea. There was no one on board. The Water Police District took it into custody on behalf of the owner, and at the same time, it was advertised to be claimed. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received this message and urgently sent its members Shi Weijun and Zhang Huanwen to Haimen to inspect it. After reconnaissance, it was confirmed that it was the iron barge from Nanjing that had drifted away from the Liu River.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Negotiating to Retrieve <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Shi and Zhang arrived in Haimen and contacted the Water Police District. It was said that the iron barge was found in the Songji Port. Since there was no one on board to ask, and the company name was not indicated, there was no way to notify the claim. Now that it has been proven to belong to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it can be returned. Shi and Zhang first returned to Shanghai yesterday morning to report to the head of the shipping department, prepared an official letter to claim it, and the company negotiated with the Xinrenhe ship to tow it back to Shanghai on behalf of the company. The company also decided to heavily reward the Haimen Water Police District for taking care of the barge.</p>
<h3 id="e179">The Dispute Over Awning Licenses on Nanjing Road Has Been Settled <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession charges 1 yuan and 40 cents annually for awning licenses along Nanjing Road. The donation department of the Public Works Department used to send people to collect them door-to-door every summer, which was very convenient. This year, it was suddenly changed to be paid by the stores themselves, but without formal notice. Because the stores did not know about the change, they had not paid for the licenses. Then, the Laozao Police Station, without asking for the reason, suddenly accused dozens of stores on that road of violating the regulations in the Special District Court. After receiving the court summons, the stores reported in fear to the Nanjing Road Business Association. The two chairmen of the association, Wang and Sun, negotiated with the police station and learned about the situation of the change. They immediately questioned the police station for not giving formal notice in advance and should not have been so critical. The police chief shirked responsibility one by one, and there was no result. After the committee members of the association reported to the two chairmen, they were extremely angry and immediately appointed five representatives, Wang Lianfang, Sun Wenyi, Chen Duoming, Zhuang Zhihe, and Zhou Juchen, to present a letter to the Public Works Department for serious negotiations. He Dehui, the chairman, received them, and after the representatives explained, Chairman He confirmed that the police station's actions were inappropriate and promised to immediately instruct the police station to withdraw the accusations. The representatives also requested that in order to facilitate merchants, they should still send people to collect the fees as usual in the future. Chairman He has also agreed. It is heard that the accusations have now been withdrawn by the police station, and a crisis has been settled.</p>

<p>Russian Lai Weisi Ji and Labor Fanuofu, etc., on March 28th of this year, pretended to be the French Deputy Consul and the French Consul General at the Dentomo Hotel in the Public Concession, wanting to work on establishing a gambling den in the French Concession for Xu Haidu, and the fraud was unsuccessful. The French police detected it and detained Lai, etc., and sent them to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Judge Sun sentenced Lai Weisi Ji and Labor Fanuofu to one year of imprisonment each. The details have been recorded in the previous newspaper. Because the two defendants did not understand the first instance judgment, they hired a lawyer to appeal to the meeting court of the Second Special Court. The court approved it and Judge Li Xuannian opened an investigation court in the First Criminal Court yesterday morning. The two defendants were proposed, and the two defendants stated the reasons for their appeal, roughly saying that the merchants have known Xu Haidu for many years, how can they not know what industry the merchants are doing, and the money discussed was not taken in any way. Judge Li ruled to continue the hearing on the morning of August 6.</p>

Fearing misunderstandings by customs, they had previously submitted five articles of collection and transportation methods to the Customs Administration for compliance. Recently, these boats were transporting dried fish from Dagushan to Shanghai when they were suddenly detained at Songkou by the Anti-Smuggling Division of the Jianghai Customs, who suspected them. They claimed that half of the cargo must be confiscated and all foreign taxes must be paid. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned that the boat owners, such as Ju Lairen, pleaded with the Shanghai Fresh Fish Trade Association to negotiate reasonably. The association sent Standing Committee members Zhu Bao and Fang Guoliang to present the situation to Chairman Du of the association, who then submitted a petition to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Inspector General of Customs and Supervisor Tang for their release. It is reported that the boats were released last night (25th).</p>
<p>Shanghai Bar Association Forwarded Petition</p>
<h3 id="e187">Appeal Letter from Prisoners in Jintan County Prison <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association submitted a letter to the Jiangsu Higher Court, stating that it was forwarding an appeal letter from prisoners in Jintan County Prison and requesting an investigation. The letter stated, "Our country's prison administration has been notorious for its darkness. Now that the revolution has succeeded and the whole country is working to build a foundation for the rule of law, prison administration has begun to look promising. However, prison duties are detailed and complex, and few wise people are willing to try them easily. Therefore, some corrupt elements inevitably lurk within. They have no experience or knowledge and only know how to be despotic and enrich themselves. Prison reform has encountered a major obstacle. Recently, the prison warden of Jintan County Prison, Zhan Qiulai, has been pursuing his private desires and flaunting his lewd power since taking office, considering cruelty as competence and enlightenment as a wrong path. He uses deceptive tricks as sacred scriptures and follows the ashes of stubborn evil as norms. He also deducts prisoners' rations and exploits public funds, ignoring the life and death of prisoners. The dark, sunless prison administration of the feudal era has reappeared today. Beatings are worse than the three wooden punishments, and prolonged hunger is added to the punishment of axes. The suffering compatriots in Jintan County Prison have experienced all of this. The Ministry of Justice has clearly stated that prisoners' rations should be made public and the treatment of prisoners should be improved. However, the warden obeys superiors in appearance but disobeys in reality, and when dealing with subordinates, he evades the issue. If prisoners show any dissatisfaction, he can easily accuse them of plotting rebellion, making it difficult for them to advance or retreat. The undersigned (names withheld) have gathered evidence and filed a complaint with the Ministry, but considering that they are prisoners with limited power and that cunning people are prone to distorting the truth, they humbly beg that the association, which is known for upholding humanity and helping the needy, will send a telegram of assistance to alleviate this desperate situation. If the association turns a blind eye, the prisoners will be devastated. Where justice lies, how can you bear to stand idly by? The letter also hopes to be published in the newspaper so that the whole country will know that even in this era of clear rule of law, there is still a rampant warden in Jintan County, and there are still dozens of prisoners suffering in Jintan County. Moved by righteous indignation, they jointly call for an attack, so that this small place will not be forever abandoned outside the truth. This is their earnest hope." The letter was submitted to the 170th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee of the association, which resolved to forward it to the Jiangsu Higher Court and request it to investigate the matter. It is appropriate to submit this letter to request the court's review and implementation for the public good.</p>

The company's business policy is based on service as a prerequisite, practical work, and not advocating exaggeration, so it can deeply gain the trust of the public, and business is booming.</p>

<p>Since the recent launch of the "Three Provinces" brand cigarettes, sales have been extremely strong, marking a new era in the cigarette industry. Because the person in charge of the company is a giant in the cigarette industry, and the technician who supervises the production of the cigarettes is a seasoned expert, the quality of the cigarettes is excellent and is easily welcomed and loved by all sectors of society. In addition, the price is low and there are many gifts, which complement the cigarettes, just like peony leaves complementing the silk. Therefore, sales are unprecedented.

<h3 id="e197">Scientific Rainmaking vs. Praying for Rain (Continued) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>丨Answer to Zhu Mingjun丨</p>
<p>Zhu Mingjun said that "people in the government and the public" are paying attention to the people's livelihood problems. In fact, "people in the government and the public" may not really be sincerely paying attention to the people's livelihood problems. If we study the current social structure, we will know that in society, some people hope that society will progress and can also promote social progress, but some people try their best to make society backward for their own interests. The movement to cherish the past and superstition is what this group of people is trying to do. Such people are not only in China, but also in other capitalist countries. For example, Japan now has the so-called Buddhist Solidarity Alliance, and churches in Europe and the United States still play a big role in society. These things have a significant effect on turning society backward.</p>
<p>The current disasters in Chinese society are very contradictory: in the Yangtze River basin, drought is caused by lack of rain, while in the Yellow River basin, floods are caused by too much rain. The formation of this contradictory disaster can be said to be a reason for bad weather, but the main reason is social reasons. If there are not so many people in this society who are keen on cherishing the past and restoring superstition, and can try to remedy it with scientific methods like other countries, then the disasters will not be so serious at least. However, it is impossible for Chinese society to use science to remedy it, because scientific remedy must first break all divine power and superstition, and observe nature and society accurately, and then conquer nature and promote society. Such a thing is completely contrary to the interests of some people in society. Therefore, these people would rather stagnate in the superstitious life of 2,000 years ago than allow people to open their eyes to science.</p>
<p>Under the nostalgia of these people, a small number of people are inevitably fooled. However, this deception will not last long, because fantasy behavior will not really benefit the people and will always be exposed sooner or later. Especially those with a little scientific knowledge will not be fooled, nor should they be fooled. We must stand up to passively oppose superstitious actions such as setting up altars to pray for rain, and at the same time oppose the entire nostalgia movement.</p>
<p>The principles of scientific rainmaking will be explained again clearly. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e198">Imperial Incense Drifting Record <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When we were serving her to sleep, we naturally couldn't help but sleep ourselves, but we could only lie on the floor or lean against the wall and doze off with our clothes on. If you were unlucky enough to snore too loudly and wake up the Empress Dowager's good dreams, although it wouldn't be punishable by death, you would be in for an unpleasant time! Whenever it was my turn to work the night shift, I often couldn't sleep soundly. The empty and silent atmosphere of the palace always flooded my mind. I often wondered why the autocratic and unbearable policies that the Empress Dowager was so attached to made Guangxu feel unhappy? The reason was probably because Guangxu was a person full of democratic ideas. The concepts between mother and son were fundamentally different, so of course there was no affection to speak of!</p>
<p>Looking back now, when I was serving the Empress Dowager to sleep in her bedroom, I was formally lying next to her dragon bed, but in reality, I was sitting on the corner of a page of Chinese history.</p>
<p>Those palace maids also had a special car, which was behind the car that the female officials took, meaning it was convenient to take care of each other; however, they had to take care of everything themselves, and no one served them.</p>
<p>We eight female officials had four eunuchs and four servants specially assigned to serve us. They were divided into two groups, eunuchs and eunuchs, and servants and servants. They were lying at both ends of our train car, making our beds every day, preparing water for washing, and sweeping the floor. It was the same when we went and when we came back. However, one thing that made us very inconvenient was that there was no bath to take on the road. Fortunately, this trip was only a very short one, and the weather was not very hot, so we could barely get by. The Empress Dowager usually loved cleanliness the most and took baths very diligently, but it was also very inconvenient to take a bath on the train. She had no choice but to often wipe her body and wash her feet as a substitute. And when she was wiping her body and washing her feet, the train had to be stopped specially. The life of the imperial family is indeed very enviable. Even when traveling on a train, they can still exert their authority as much as possible; but on the other hand, it makes people feel that this kind of life is too rigid, too constrained, and too meaningless.

<p>— Sha Jin</p>
<p>In Tianjin, you can often find people wearing hats crookedly, with the collars of their long gowns open, sleeves rolled up, and swaggering around. Just like in Shanghai, you often see people sticking out their stomachs and sticking up their thumbs, saying with a smug air, "Ah, la Shanghai," these people usually have a saying hanging on their lips, saying:</p>
<p>"We are from Tianjin Wei."</p>
<p>Saying Tianjin is nothing: but saying "We are from Tianjin Wei" feels a little different. Yes, its origins are not small.</p>
<p>It is said that Tianjin, the important gateway to the Bohai Sea, was originally called "Haitao" in ancient times and was the place of Jinhai Town in Hejian Prefecture. During the Ming Dynasty, a garrison was established here due to the Japanese pirates, and it was called Tianjin Wei. In the Qing Dynasty, it was promoted from Wei to Zhou, and then to Fu: since the Republic of China, it has been changed from Fu to County: now the names of Tianjin City and Tianjin County exist at the same time. It has undergone many changes, but the name "Tianjin Wei" is still habitually retained, and it is retained in the social group of "We are from Tianjin Wei."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we want to introduce the Three No-Man's-Land of Tianjin City.</p>
<p>Before talking about the text, we have to sell a gimmick first. I remember a saying, "I am not afraid of heaven, I am not afraid of earth, I am only afraid of speaking official language." This is only "two not afraid." The Three No-Man's-Land is the real Three No-Man's-Land. If you can explain it like this, "The Three No-Man's-Land means that you don't care, he doesn't care, and I don't care either," you understand the Three No-Man's-Land and it counts as pretty good.</p>
<p>Let's get back to the subject.</p>
<p>It is said that this Three No-Man's-Land is where the characters of "We are from Tianjin Wei" gather, and it is also the place where the Chinese Concession, the French Concession, and the Japanese Concession are connected.</p>
<p>Here, there are Go clubs, "Beng Beng Er." Listening to operas, watching movies, and eating pot stickers, drinking Wu Jiapi, all at our convenience.</p>
<p>There are also "flower girls"...</p>
<p>Sometimes, "We are from Tianjin Wei" comes to guest star in a "Slashing Three Passes" or "Killing Cai Yang." It is said that they hurt their harmony because of "Wulongyuan," or that "Li Kui Seizes the Fish" was not friendly enough: and made these "masters" angry and show off their "Spring and Autumn Blade."</p>
<p>In this place, the national heroic performances of these garlic-eating are very worth watching.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Our Kind Neighbors <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— A Jie</p>
<p>Our kind neighbors, although they cannot compare to the mansion districts such as Jing'an Temple Road and Hess Road, are still quiet lanes, what "villages," what "neighborhoods," the former what "Li," seem less modern than them. There are also patrolmen with guns on their waists at the entrance of the village, and there are also many cars in the village. In the morning and evening, the cool breeze blows on the leaves, there is a lot of rural flavor, and a few pretty ayis often push the sleeping cars of small babies and chat with the male servants of other families. You think! Our kind neighbors are either petty bourgeoisie, or managers of banks and money shops, or compradors of foreign firms. Actually, some of your guesses are wrong.</p>
<p>Neighbor A is an agent in the Gold Exchange. Grabbing hats and cutting flying heads, it is not uncommon to earn thirty or forty yuan a day. He is a young man of twenty-one or two, and he has many girlfriends coming in and out. At night, he either runs to the dance hall, or the handball, or the dog racing. These days, it's hot. After two o'clock, he is still not happy to sleep. He pulls the erhu and hums Beijing opera, very happy. His wife, who seems to be around thirty years old, is very generous and dresses very charmingly. She also smokes a cigarette. This young man bows to her like she is his mother. It is said that since this young man got his wife, his courage to make gold has become more and more powerful.</p>
<p>Neighbor B, some of you may not believe it. It turns out that his house is also full of red sandalwood furniture; radio, bathroom, everything is complete. His occupation is a chauffeur. It is not that the wealthy East Lord gives him special preferential treatment, special high wages, or special extra money. However, the wealthy East Lord's daughter knows the hardship of his job as a chauffeur, especially values him, and especially takes care of him, so that he has established a small mansion for a chauffeur.</p>
<p>Neighbor C's occupation is even more peculiar. He hired two or three money-making partners who do not eat or get paid. Today a monk comes to chant scriptures, tomorrow a Taoist comes to perform rituals, saying it is a hospital, but it is not a hospital. Saying it is a temple, but it is not a temple. Saying it is a warehouse, but it is not a warehouse. But his occupation can cure people's diseases: and can predict good and bad luck; and welcomes ladies and misses to play cards, smoke, chant scriptures and worship Buddha in his home. The partners he hires sit precariously in the hall all day long, without having to do anything, and can earn money for the boss. Isn't opening a "Buddha shop" a good business for the old man to make money?</p>
<p>There is also Neighbor D, who is the sister-in-law of a rogue; Neighbor F, who is an outdated politician who buys short and sells short; Neighbor E, who is a famous Jianghu fortune-teller: loquacious, I don't have the time to write a biography for them, but I lived in the pavilion room for a month, and I gradually became ugly, so I quickly moved away.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Northeast Four Battalion Commanders <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 32: Amusements of Sight and Sound, the General Enjoys Himself All Day Long; The Old and Young Weep, Soldiers Almost Return.</p>
<p>Madam Jiang understood in her heart that this must be the division commander. She immediately squatted down to show respect and ensure her legs were safe. Only then did the division commander take out the cigarette he was holding in his mouth, tapped off the ash into the spittoon beside him, and then asked: "What is your esteemed surname?" Madam Jiang said: "My surname is Yang." The division commander said: "Are you also in the grain business?" Madam Jiang said: "My in-laws are in the grain business." The division commander said: "What? Are you related to the grain store across the street?" Madam Jiang said: "No, my in-laws used to manage disaster relief in this grain business." The division commander said: "Are you saying that he gave his daughter to you, or you gave your daughter to him as a daughter-in-law?" Madam Jiang said: "His daughter-in-law is my daughter." The division commander said: "How many daughters do you have?" Madam Jiang said: "Just one." The division commander became agitated upon hearing this, suddenly straightened his back and sat up straight, and asked: "Is she married?" Although Madam Jiang felt that this division commander was being too long-winded, she didn't know why, but she felt timid after arriving at this place, perhaps frightened by the two guards she saw in the alley. So she continued to answer: "She's been married for more than half a year." The division commander said: "What does your son-in-law do?" Madam Jiang said: "He's a battalion commander." These four words entered the division commander's ears and felt particularly uncomfortable, but he couldn't say that your son-in-law shouldn't be a soldier, so he said "Oh," and asked: "He's in the military. Where is he a battalion commander?" Madam Jiang said: "He's been stationed outside Xifengkou, and we haven't heard from him in almost two months. We're very worried. Is it peaceful outside the pass now, Division Commander?" Upon hearing this, the division commander stood up and asked: "Do you know where he's stationed outside the pass?" As he spoke, his eyes were fixed on Madam Jiang's face. Madam Jiang said: "I do know, he's stationed in Ping'an Fort." The division commander suddenly sat back down on the chair. At the same time, the color on his face changed from pale to red, and he asked: "What is your son-in-law's name?" Madam Jiang said: "His name is Zhao Ziqiang. I hope the Division Commander will promote him in the future." (443)</p>
<p>Biographical Sketches</p>
<h3 id="e203">Shanghai Book Collectors in the Qing Dynasty <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>Last time when we talked about old Shanghai's book collectors, we issued a reservation coupon, saying that there were other famous book collectors of the Qing Dynasty who would appear in the "next issue." Now we will redeem this reservation coupon.</p>
<p>Qing Dynasty scholarship was shrouded in the atmosphere of textual research, so Qing Dynasty book collectors also had a strong archaeological flavor, proofreading classics and history, researching bronze and stone inscriptions, which was different from the style of book collectors in the Song and Ming dynasties. Shanghai was no exception.</p>
<p>Li Yunjia, styled Xiulin, also known as Sunxiang, lived during the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods. This was the heyday of Qing Dynasty scholarship, and Li was able to follow and match the contemporary talents. He bought the former residence of Zhu Chaqing of the Ming Dynasty, the Ciyun Tower, in the eastern part of the county seat, and collected more than 6,000 kinds of books, which were stored there. In the sixth year of Daoguang, Gong Zizhen wrote a preface to his bibliography, saying, "The Li family of Shanghai has a collection of more than 4,700 kinds of books, with notes and commentaries totaling 390,000 words. The style of peace and prosperity shines together with the Fan family of Yin County, the Wang family of She County, and the Wu and Bao families of Hangzhou for eighty or ninety years." To put the Tianyige, Zhenqitang, Pinghuazhai, Zhibuzu Zhai, and Ciyunlou together, it can be seen that the atmosphere of that day covered the coastal area.</p>
<p>Speaking of Li's bibliography, one admires his academic rigor. He was able to collect books and also able to read them. Therefore, he compiled the books in his collection into an eight-volume catalog, and also included his reading notes in it. He once said: Hui Dongzhu's Yi Dayi uses the Doctrine of the Mean to explain the Book of Changes, which is not the attitude that a Han scholar should have; Jiang Sheng's Shangshu Ji Wangyin Shu changed all the modern characters into ancient characters, which is a bit rigid and unyielding. These opinions are considered to be very accurate.</p>
<p>Li Yunjia's grandson, named Zhongqing, was skilled in poetry, and his collection of paintings and calligraphy included many fine copies, such as General Xiao Li's Spring River Picture, Old Man Shangu's Thousand Character Classic, and Zhang Zeduan's Qingming Shanghe Tu Poetry Scroll, all of which were rare. Qiao Chongxi's poem mourning Yunjia said, "After your death, the collection of books will be scattered." It is unknown whether this was because his son was incompetent or because his son was too young when he passed away. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, Bao Shuzhi's Baoshu Zaji, written by a native of Ganquan Township, said that the Jin-engraved Kong Family Ancestral Hall Guangji, formerly collected by Li Sunxiang, was obtained by Ma Huzhai, a contemporary.</p>
<p>Mei Yizheng, styled Fuzhai, loved books by nature, and personally collated good editions. Over the decades, he compiled a forty-two-volume collection of books. He was a contemporary of Li Yunjia, but not as famous as Li.</p>
<p>Speaking of the history of book collection in the Qing Dynasty, one cannot avoid the relationship with Suzhou Prefecture. Because in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, almost all the old books of the Song and Yuan dynasties belonged to Qian Qianyi and Mao Zijin, and were scattered from the two families to Ji Zhenyi, and then returned to Huang Yaopu, and then to Wang Langyuan, and never went beyond Wu "Gate." However, when Wang Langyuan's collection of books was dispersed, a part of it flowed into Shanghai and was obtained by Yu Taifeng. Taifeng's name was Songnian, styled Wanzhi, and he was an En Gong student in the twenty-fifth year of Daoguang. Songnian was rich and fond of reading. At that time, the Taiping Army recovered Jiangnan, and the books in Wu were scattered. Because Shanghai was outside the military area, the Yu family took this opportunity to preserve many old editions. However, his collection of books was soon scattered, and most of it was obtained by Ding Richang. Later, when Ding's books were scattered, a part of them flowed back to Shanghai Hanfenlou (later the Oriental Library).</p>
<p>Xu Weiren, a contemporary of Yu Songnian, was also a great collector and a epigraphist. His name was Wentai, styled Zishan. His appraisal of rubbings was regarded as the best by contemporaries. He once obtained the Dong Meiren Stele from the Kaihuang period of the Sui Dynasty, which was a very rare ancient engraving, so he called himself "Suixuan."</p>
<p>Suixuan paid close attention to collecting local literature. The rare Jiajing Shanghai County Chronicle and the extremely rare Wanli Shanghai County Chronicle were both temporarily housed in the Xu family. (The Wanli Chronicle has a Zhuwen Chang seal that says "Formerly collected by Xu Zishan.") Now the "Jia Chronicle" has been circulated in the form of photo-lithography by the Chuanzhen Society, and the "Wan Chronicle" is stored in the Xuhui Library.</p>
<p>After this era, we should pay attention to the library of group culture. When we recall the magnificence of the individual efforts of the past era, we must express our respect.</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Issues Instructions on Key Points for Improvement of Colleges and Universities (7)</p>
<h3 id="e204">Shanghai National Conservatory of Music <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The students in the training program of the school are diligent and their academic performance is also remarkable, which is commendable. As for the shortcomings of the school, except for the two items of funding and school buildings, which should be addressed after the Ministry plans specific measures, the number of students in the school's specialized departments should be expanded as much as possible, and musical instruments, sheet music, books, and other teaching equipment should be increased appropriately within the possible range. In addition, attention should be paid to the collection of national folk songs and ballads and the research of music teaching materials for primary and secondary schools in Europe and the United States for reference. According to reports, the school has found it difficult to recruit high school graduates due to various reasons, so it can recruit junior high school graduates and extend the length of study to provide relief. The detailed measures should be properly drafted by the school and submitted for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Shanghai Private Fine Arts College <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The key points for improvement of the school are specially highlighted on the left:</p>
<p>(1) The school's financial difficulties have led to huge debts. In the future, it should actively raise funds. The current assets and debts should be cleaned up and estimated by experts as soon as possible, and a repayment plan should be formulated. The school property should be clearly defined and not mixed with private property. On the one hand, it is appropriate to prevent abuse and compensate for the arrears of salaries to teachers and staff this year. The accounting should adopt new-style bookkeeping and strict management to ensure that what is taken from the students is still used for the students.</p>
<p>(2) The deposit for building a new school building is only more than 10,000 yuan, which is far from enough. Active planning should be made to complete it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(3) When the inspector went to the school this time, many students were late for the drawing class. It is said that classes start at 9:00 every morning and roll call is at 10:00, which shows that the school's supervision of classes is very lax. In the future, the methods of management and training should be comprehensive, and enrollment should be carefully selected. Students' academic qualifications, grades, and graduation procedures must be reported in advance for approval in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>(4) The sculpture department's imitation of antiquities and plaster models is well-intentioned, but the manufacturing should still pay attention to the representative works of art from past dynasties in our country, and at the same time pay attention to the research of decorative arts in our country.</p>
<p>(5) According to the school's outline of organization, the school may set up a research class but not an institute. The research institute should be renamed the research class.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Shanghai Private Xinhua Art College <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The key points for improvement of the school are highlighted on the left:</p>
<p>(1) The school's funding can only maintain the status quo, and the main source is student fees, which is enough to hinder the progress of school affairs. It is urgent to raise funds to enrich the equipment. The accounting records are not detailed enough, and new-style bookkeeping should be used to thoroughly organize them.</p>
<p>(2) The school building should be actively expanded. It is reported that a part of the existing building is not very strong, and engineering experts should be hired immediately to inspect it to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>(3) Each department of the specialized department is still called a department, which is inappropriate and should be renamed a group. The research institute should be renamed the research class.</p>
<p>(4) Teachers and students often have absences from class, which should be strictly prevented. Teachers should be given higher salaries, and enrollment should be carefully selected. Students' meals should be arranged on campus.</p>
<p>(5) The library only opens after 4:00 p.m. every day, which defeats the purpose of setting up a library and must be revised.</p>
<p>The board of directors and school authorities of the school should pay close attention to the above points and actively improve them.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Suzhou Private Fine Arts College <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>After completing the new school building, the school was able to raise more than 10,000 yuan in the midst of difficulties to increase the equipment of the practical arts department. The efforts of the board of directors and the school authorities are commendable. However, the original operating expenses are very small, which can only maintain the status quo, resulting in no ability to develop school affairs. In the future, it should actively raise funds, expand equipment, increase teachers' salaries, hire more excellent professionals, and increase the number of specialized students to seek the development of the school. The accounting is still using the old-style account book, which is not clear enough and should be replaced with new-style bookkeeping. In addition, attention must be paid to the qualifications for admission during enrollment. The above points should be followed immediately. The establishment of practical arts courses in public and private art colleges has been ordered by the Ministry for compliance. The school has added a practical arts department and has considerable equipment. The management is still practical. Suzhou is one of the handicraft centers in our country. Recently, due to the impact of industrial competition, it has suffered a setback. If the province can use the equipment of the school's practical arts department to jointly run a practical arts vocational school, it will be helpful to the local handicraft industry.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Wuchang National Wuhan University <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The school's new school buildings have a beautiful environment and are able to pay attention to equipment, which is very suitable for teaching and research. All facilities of the school are in compliance with regulations. The faculty and staff of each college are full-time, the students are diligent and hardworking, and the academic style is good. The law school is particularly able to pay attention to research, which is commendable. However, the following points still need to be improved:</p>
<p>(1) The classrooms of the school's science college lack sufficient light, and the laboratories are also too small. The doors and windows of the dormitory are set against the wall, failing to take advantage of the natural scenery. In the future, new buildings must pay attention to aesthetics, but at the same time, they must also consider the applicability aspect.</p>
<p>(2) The equipment of the school's science college is gradually improving. In the future, if teachers are selected more carefully and teachers are made to devote themselves to research, teaching efficiency will be improved.</p>
<p>(3) The school is a newly emerging university, and the president's duties are heavy. The original position of director of the chemistry department should be filled by another expert to take charge.</p>
<p>(4) The school's engineering college has been established, and its newly established departments should continue to be filled with equipment. The preparations for the agricultural college should be carried out effectively.</p>
<p>(5) The school's training and student coursework should continue to be made the responsibility of teachers to pay close attention to and provide practical guidance, with the overall goal of promoting a simple and orderly academic style and displaying a spirit of enthusiasm.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Wuchang Private Huazhong University <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Although the school's funding is small, the distribution is reasonable, and the equipment is generally sufficient for application. Most of the faculty and staff are full-time and able to serve enthusiastically. The students are diligent in their studies, and the level is neat, and the performance assessment is also serious. These achievements show the efforts. However, the school's organizational outline lists music groups, mathematics groups, and physical education groups. The nature of these groups is not very clear and should be submitted for review.</p>
<p>(1) The department of social sciences has few students and does not need to be divided into groups. After reviewing the content of the department's curriculum, it should be renamed the department of history and social sciences.</p>
<p>(2) The departments of educational methods, educational administration, and the sub-department of educational psychology should be merged and renamed the department of education, and attention should be paid to the training of teachers for secondary schools.</p>
<p>(3) The mathematics group's curriculum should be merged into the physics department, and the music and physical education groups' curricula should be merged into the education department. Students in the department can still take elective courses, and it is not necessary to call them groups.</p>
<p>In addition, the school's recognition that graduates from Wenhua Middle School and other 13 schools have priority in taking the entrance examination is also inappropriate. In the future, open recruitment should be conducted, and graduates from public and private secondary schools registered with the Ministry should be treated equally. The school should also appropriately increase the number of domestic specialized scholars to teach political, economic, social, and historical courses.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Wuchang Private Zhonghua University <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The founder of the school is quite intent on developing school affairs, but the financial resources are limited and the management lacks achievements. It should immediately follow the following points and make practical improvements to facilitate rectification:</p>
<p>(1) The school's original school site is not suitable. Although it has been added over the years, the land is small and the houses are many, and there is almost no space in the school. Safety, hygiene, practicality, and aesthetics have not been taken into account. It should raise construction funds as soon as possible and build the Dongshan school building as soon as possible, and move the university part out. The primary and secondary schools should still be run separately at the original site.</p>
<p>(2) The school's funding is far from the standard stipulated in Article 10 of the University Regulations, and the source of income is not stable. Recurring expenses still require borrowing, and there is no mountain plan for construction. A foundation should be added to thicken the economic foundation.</p>
<p>(3) The school's financial resources are limited. It is not enough to allocate them to the original colleges and departments, as well as the primary and secondary school departments. The scope should be reduced and the content should be enriched. The chemistry department should be discontinued immediately, and students in the department may be ordered to transfer to the physics department to continue their studies, or find ways to transfer to other schools to study or borrow classes. Other departments should submit a reduction plan to the Ministry for review within one month from the date of the document.</p>
<p>(4) There are very few books in the school's library that can be used for teaching reference. Books on mathematics, physics, and chemistry, as well as important scientific journals, are particularly rare. The equipment for ordinary physics experiments is insufficient for application, and the equipment for advanced experiments is lacking. Chemical instruments and reagents are also extremely lacking. All of the above equipment must be added as soon as possible to facilitate teaching. (5) Some of the school's directors and professors lack expertise in the courses they teach and hold concurrent positions outside the school, which greatly affects teaching efficiency. Specialized talents should be hired as professors as much as possible to teach earnestly.</p>
<p>(6) The school has recruited new students in the past with too low standards, and the grading of usual exams is also too lenient. There are no strict regulations on repeat grades, suspension, and other punishments, so that students neglect their studies and their levels are low. In the future, the standards for recruitment must be raised, and the entrance examination must be strictly administered to reduce the number of admissions. After admission, the courses must be checked carefully, strictly trained, and strict rules must be established and implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Hubei Institute of Education <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The institute's teachers, equipment, and curriculum are not substantial, and other management conditions are mostly unsuitable. Enrollment should still be suspended this year. The existing classes should reduce education subjects and increase natural science and agronomy courses. The fundamental improvement measures of the institute should be drafted separately by the department and submitted for review.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Anqing Provincial Anhui University <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The school should strive to improve the key points for improvement are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The mathematics and physics departments of the College of Science should be merged into the department of mathematics and physics.</p>
<p>(2) The law school will be closed immediately. The original students will either be allowed to transfer to another school or be allowed to change departments. The school will draft measures for handling it.</p>
<p>(3) The establishment of the College of Agriculture should begin with equipment. In the future, it must be approved by the Ministry after inspection before enrollment.</p>
<p>(4) In addition to complying with the Ministry's enrollment restriction order this year, the number of students in each department should be reduced in the next academic year, and the entrance examination should be strictly administered.</p>
<p>(5) Teachers should be full-time in principle, and part-time teachers should be reduced as much as possible, not exceeding one-fourth of the total number of teachers. The number of teachers should also be reduced effectively.</p>
<p>(6) Rules should be established to strictly limit teachers' absences from class and students' absences from class.</p>
<p>(7) Equipment fees should be increased as much as possible, adding books and instruments, and building school buildings. This cannot be delayed any longer and should be carried out as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Changsha Private Xiangya Medical College <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The school is able to strictly implement training, management, and teaching, which is commendable. Other management conditions are generally not unsuitable, but the school's source of funding is not stable, and a fixed fund should be raised separately and the content should be enriched.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Tianjin Private Nankai University <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The school's teachers are strictly full-time and able to work hard in teaching. The internal management of the school is also effective. The economic research association, the chemical industry research institute, and the department of mathematics have rich collections and have made considerable achievements, which are commendable. However, the following points still need to be improved effectively:</p>
<p>(1) The curriculum and teachers of the school's economics college and business college are almost identical, and there is no name for the economics college in the university organization law. The economics college should be canceled immediately, or it should be merged with the economic research association and reorganized as an economic research institute, which should be submitted for review separately. The original departments of the economics and business colleges should also be considered for reduction and merger and submitted to the Ministry for review.</p>
<p>(2) The pre-medical department of the school is not in accordance with the Ministry's regulations. The pre-medical course has long been canceled by the Ministry's order. The department should be discontinued immediately, and the original students should be allowed to transfer to other departments of the College of Science.</p>
<p>(3) The school's physics department should hire excellent professors to be responsible for guidance, so that it can develop evenly with other departments.</p>
<p>(4) The names of all courses in the school's curriculum are in English, which is also inappropriate. In the future, they should all be changed to Chinese.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Hebei Fisheries College <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The points that the school should improve are ordered separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Suspend the recruitment of specialized students (new students and transfer students) from the next academic year.</p>
<p>(2) The attached senior vocational fisheries department should be renamed the attached senior vocational fisheries school. The curriculum should be compiled and organized in accordance with the provisions of the teaching subjects and time summaries of the vocational school departments promulgated by the Ministry.</p>
<p>(3) Actively find ways to move the school to the coast.</p>
<p>(4) Make a reasonable allocation of the original funding and seek to increase funding, enrich equipment, reduce the number of staff members, and hire specialized talents.</p>

<h3 id="e245">On the Theory of Literary Ventilation (Part 1) <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>If there is oppression, it is natural to release it quickly. One cannot live without oppression, and oppression cannot be left unvented. This is almost universally felt. The heart should go out for a spin, being locked up indoors all the time isn't the way to go. But while everyone desires to release oppression, the ingenuity of the methods varies from person to person. The best at releasing oppression is the literati; the worst is the fool, because the fool's "cursing the undertaker" is not a "skillful" or "ingenious" method. (Someone translates "Humour" as "the marvel of words.")</p>
<p>Chu Ch'i-pai believed that literature is a "symbol of suffering," but I believe that the release of suffering must be the essence of literature. Ordinary literati have four methods of venting oppression, and "cursing the undertaker" is not one of them. Jiao Da's complete revelation of the ugly state of the Grand View Garden is ultimately not a clever approach. Since literati cannot learn from the *Book of Changes* to "escape the world without oppression," they must find ways to vent the oppression they see and feel. The method of venting must both open the appetite and please the eyes and ears. This is why humorous literature is so popular in this era. I fundamentally do not understand what humor is, but I love to talk about the methods of venting oppression by literati. What are the four methods of venting oppression? First, satire; second, implication; third, coldness and refinement; fourth, indignation.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the first method of venting oppression, satire. Confucius said, "There are five ways to advise, and I follow the way of satire." If the mouth must offer advice, the heart must already be suffering. To vent this suffering, one must not be direct or rude. The best way is to start with satire. Poets use the image of large rats eating millet seedlings to satirize rulers who heavily tax the people. Zhu Xuhou's field-plowing song uses the phrase "those who are not of the same kind should be weeded out" to subtly imply the elimination of those not of the royal lineage. Cao Zijian's seven-step poem uses the metaphor of "cooking beans with beanstalks" to satirically advise his elder brother not to persecute him. As for disliking someone without directly criticizing them, but dusting flies with a fly whisk and saying, "Where did you come from? Why do you gather here!" More of these examples can be found in *A New Account of Tales of the World*. Other examples, such as the writings of Zhuangzi and Mencius, Aesop's Fables, and Liu Zihou's "Three Admonitions," are all good examples of satire and can be considered the champion of methods for venting oppression.</p>
<p>The second is implication. The effect of implication is that the listener must think about it to understand. His oppression is vented without being vented, and this is the most flavorful. The best at venting oppression through implication can be found in the words of lyricists:</p>
<p>"When young, I knew not the taste of sorrow,</p>
<p>I loved to climb the tower,</p>
<p>I loved to climb the tower,</p>
<p>And forced myself to write poems about sorrow."</p>
<p>"Now that I know the taste of sorrow,</p>
<p>I want to speak, but I stop,</p>
<p>I want to speak, but I stop,</p>
<p>And instead say, 'It's a good autumn day, it's getting cool!'"</p>
<p>What a great "It's a good autumn day, it's getting cool!" After "I want to speak, but I stop," there is endless oppression being endured. Although he only says five words, "It's a good autumn day, it's getting cool," people already know that he is full of complaints. This is what Sikong Tu meant by "Without a single word, the elegance is fully captured. The language does not involve oneself, yet the suffering is unbearable." Confucius said, "I want to be silent." Buddha said, "Unspeakable! Unspeakable!" Laozi said, "Cannot be spoken of, cannot be named." All these are the same principle! (Note that I am not advocating the unity of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism.)</p>
<p>Later generations of literati who were able to grasp this method of venting oppression through implication are not many. In the poems of the Tang Dynasty, Chen Ziang's "Before, I saw no ancient people; after, I see no future people. Thinking of the boundlessness of heaven and earth, I am saddened and weep," with only twenty-two words, is the best "nostalgic" poem of all time, simply because there is not much ink used, and it has the charm of implication. Just think of the spirit he had, encompassing all the sorrows of the ages in his chest, gently uttering them, and it became a masterpiece for venting the great oppression of the world. Li Bai's "The beautiful woman rolls up the pearl curtain, sits deeply, and frowns. I only see her tear-stained face, but I don't know who she hates." He did not reveal the beauty's heart in its entirety. He only wrote a question, but it has already become the best "complaint of a woman in her boudoir" for thousands of years. The message of high-quality literature can be found in this, not in saying a lot of nonsense.</p>
<p>There is also a wonderful example, seen in a certain novel, which is also for venting a daughter's anger. Not long after Qinchun got married, her husband went away on a long trip. She told of her experience over the years, saying: "At eighteen, I married my husband, at nineteen, my husband left, at twenty, he did not return, and this year I am twenty-one!" There is no fleshy talk like what young poets say now, such as "The fire of youth is burning, the spring of a loving heart cannot be closed," etc. However, the implied meaning is enough for you to savor. Without saying oppression, the oppression is naturally vented. Isn't it better than venting oppression and making people not feel the oppression?</p>
<h3 id="e246">New Ideas of Politicians <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Han</p>
<p>The Pan-Pacific Buddhist Congress has already demonstrated the cooperation of China, Japan, and "Manchuria."</p>
<p>Amid the cries for help in the face of drought, Chinese Buddhists and Zhang Tianshi are displaying their supernatural powers. In the provinces of Hunan and Guangdong, which are threatened by banditry, the revival of Confucianism is also in full swing.</p>
<p>On the Pacific coast, where explosives are buried everywhere, religious figures are in the limelight this year.</p>
<p>It is said that politicians used to regard the separation of state and religion as a progressive idea, but recently, for some reason, they regard the separation of politics and religion as an old idea and instead want to combine politics and religion. Not only that, but education and religion should also not be as separate as before.</p>
<p>Their own explanation is this: Last year, Japanese Prime Minister Saito and other cabinet members said at a reception of the Buddhist Federation: "The task of stabilizing people's hearts and guiding their thoughts depends on religious figures." Also, at the previous Japanese Religious Congress, the Minister of Education gave a speech saying: "How can we eliminate the social unrest that modern world suffers from? Although the reasons are complex, tracing back to the root, the emphasis on materialism is the root cause. All social facilities, although they are not ineffective as symptomatic treatments, but as for radical solutions, the overcoming of materialism must be the first. And the overcoming of materialism can only hope for the high tone of spiritualism… The ultimate point of spiritualism must be left to the power of religion." (See *Kaizo*, May issue of this year)</p>
<p>Chinese religious promoters probably have the same view, needless to say. The ideas of the new era should always be equally new.</p>
<p>In short, the idea of defeating Western materialism with Eastern spiritualism is very old and very popular. I wish the victory of spiritualism! || Because the victory of spiritualism is Eastern, and we belong to the East!</p>
<p>But there is one question: does Japanese imperialism want the victory of spiritualism or materialism in Manchuria?</p>
<p>Yes, in the face of their vulgar pursuit of materialism, we can only overcome it with the high tone of spiritualism!</p>

<h3 id="e247">On Fierce People <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>In Cantonese dialect, "fierce people" refers to millionaires or those who possess a large number of soldiers.</p>
<p>But according to those who are slightly thoughtful, the fierceness of fierce people is actually as soft as cotton. The meaning of fierceness is strength, bravery, and vigor. Millionaires and warlords lack these virtues. Is there a millionaire who does not love money? Is there a warlord who is not afraid of death? Are they fierce? They are not fierce!</p>
<p>So, who can be considered a fierce person?</p>
<p>A fierce person generally has a great soul, a strong virtue, residing in a healthy body. Further analysis of this personality can reveal several characteristics:</p>
<p>The greatness of the soul lies in its clarity, which may be innate or honed through suffering. The best metaphor is "light," round and fixed, illuminating all darkness. All the ghosts and monsters of the world are clear at a glance. No matter what kind of hooks or probes, they cannot penetrate the depths of this soul. Although this clarity is seen, its boundaries are unknowable.</p>
<p>Therefore, they regard space and time as nothing. They do not take life as pleasure or death as suffering, nor do they crave life or regard death as a return. They see a hundred years as a moment, yet they can persevere to the end of their lives, seeing a hundred years as a hundred years. They do not distinguish between grand mansions and burial mounds, and they treat wealth and poverty with indifference.</p>
<p>Then, after emptying life and death and worldly laws, doesn't it seem like they are carefree, without self or others? Not so. Although they regard the so-called fierce people of today as children, they are not bloodthirsty and do not drink the blood, sweat, and tears of mankind. They pity all the fools who are dominated by money and fame in this world, planning for their future and relieving the suffering of their souls and bodies.</p>
<p>Using this yardstick to measure the so-called great men and celebrities of ancient and modern times, one can gain new understanding.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Darkness <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Qun</p>
<p>It was probably around midnight, because I couldn't sleep, I climbed out of bed, opened the window, and looked at the night scene outside.</p>
<p>Not only was there no moon in the sky, but not a single star could be found. Outside the window, there was only a kind of gloomy, pitch-black night.</p>
<p>In this terrifying darkness, I heard the mournful cries of little birds calling for help and the fierce cries of cruel owls. Afterwards, the air became deathly still, which was truly frightening. Chickens didn't crow, dogs didn't bark, and all the insects seemed to be suppressed by the terrifying, gloomy, pitch-black night, afraid to make a sound, afraid to breathe.</p>
<p>At this time, the only thing that could be seen was the shadow of the bat, neither bird nor beast, daring to fly boldly, proudly, and arrogantly along the corners of the walls and eaves.</p>
<p>"Oh! This is the epitome of the 20th-century world!"</p>
<p>I was ashamed and disgusted by the ugly state of the two-faced arrogant bat, and I hated the sound of the cruel owl.</p>
<p>Oh, darkness! The world is no longer a world. Don't drag on any longer! Heaven, oh heaven! Please brighten up quickly. Sun, oh sun! Why haven't you come out yet? (Written in the mountains of Chaling)</p>
<h3 id="e249">Hometown <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>

<p>It was the time when the wheat was about to turn yellow. Driven by the whip of unemployment, I was forced to return to my hometown, from which I had been separated for ten years. My wandering heart stirred up endless melancholy in silent contemplation! The Guanyin Temple at the entrance of the village no longer echoes with melodious chimes. The prosperity of incense in the past has vanished with the waves of famine. The winding pebble streets are lined with piles of cow dung, pig excrement, and garbage. The village at night is frighteningly quiet. The watchman's clapper sounds sparsely, like the inner throbbing of the impoverished. In the distant wilderness, there is the faint sound of village women summoning souls, the mournful sound stream filled with fear and sinking into depression! The playmates of my childhood all feel the pinch of life now. When we meet, no one has the heart to mention the laughter of the past. The suffering before our eyes is enough to endure. Alas, my hometown, from which I have been separated for ten years, has evoked a string of personal sorrows!</p>

<p>— Xingye</p>
<p>The border between Canada and the United States stretches for over three thousand miles. If there is a peaceful and ideal national border in the world, this three-thousand-mile border would be the first. For over a hundred years, no conflicts have occurred on either side of the border, and there are no defensive installations on the border itself. Geographically, the United States and Canada are naturally one. Decades ago, ambitious figures in the United States often had attempts to annex Canada by force or diplomacy. Now, such plans are rarely mentioned. Sixty years of goods exchange, economic cooperation, and people-to-people exchanges have made Canada, in effect, a part of the United States. Formally, Canada flies the British flag; economically, they use American goods, read American newspapers and magazines, and follow American customs and trends. Britain's influence in Canada is gradually being replaced by the United States. Of course, the British Conservative Party and the pro-British faction in Canada, since the Ottawa Conference, have used forced measures to increase the interdependent relationship between Canada and Britain, but the voyage from London to Montreal takes more than a week, while it only takes a few hours from New York to Montreal. The Canadian people living on this long, three-thousand-mile border can often greet residents within the US border from their doorsteps. This relationship makes Canadians feel that Washington is closer and more intimate than London.</p>
<p>Commercially speaking, Canada is the United States' largest market. In the past year, Canada's total population of only ten million consumed US$232 million worth of American goods. At the same time, the United States is a major customer for Canadian goods. Last year, Americans bought US$184 million worth of Canadian goods. Moreover, the economic relationship between the two countries is further strengthened by investment. There are now 4.1 billion American capital in Canada, while British capital in Canada is only 2.2 billion.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation and shipping, Canada and the United States are even more interdependent. The two major railways that are the lifeblood of Canada (CPR and CNR) often carry goods and passengers from the United States. In particular, the shipping company Changxing Company (C·PR·) that goes to the Far East does most of its business with Americans. The company's branches are set up in larger cities in the United States. The company's shares belong to people in Canada, the United States, and Britain. The company's business is largely handled by Americans. Changxing Company's propaganda skills are very famous. Every year, many American tourists send money to Canada, mostly as a result of this company's propaganda. However, propaganda must also have practical value as a foundation. Changxing Company's trains, hotels, and ships are indeed cleaner and neater than the American average. And the scenic areas operated by Canadians are also better than those in the United States.</p>

<p>Serious Situation in Central Europe</p>
<h3 id="e252">Sudden Rise of Selling Pressure in the Gold Market <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>丨Decline of Five Yuan and Three Jiao丨</p>
<p>The gold market was initially calm but then weakened, due to the sudden deterioration of the situation in Germany and Austria, which impacted people's confidence. The gold market initially opened with overseas silver markets showing stability in England and rising prices in America. The five-gold exchange's forward silver price remained unchanged and slightly decreased by eight haos. London spot gold rose by half a penny, exchange rates slightly decreased, American wheat rose by 1.625, American cotton rose slightly, and stock prices both rose and fell. Preliminary trading opened steadily and then reported stability. After opening, the bank's appetite decreased, and sellers became active and prices went downstream. But the situation was generally stable. The HSBC exchange rate posting was revealed, and the British and American rates remained unchanged, hovering around one yuan, showing a mediocre trend. Later, buyers became more enthusiastic, and prices rose briefly. However, the bank continued to supply, making it difficult to sustain, and trading in the market became more idle and quiet. Later, news came from the Seattle night silver market reporting a decrease of .125, no change, and a decrease of .25, only a slight rebound. The bank continued to sell forward US dollars, and prices went downstream again but the trend was peaceful, merely hovering. After the noon close, a sudden selling trend emerged, due to a Reuters report that the Austrian Chancellor was assassinated and various countries were extremely uneasy. Prices broke the 90-yuan mark. Afterwards, the Seattle night silver market reported increases of .25, .25, .25, and .125. Reuters reported that the situation in Germany, Austria, and Italy was deteriorating. The German Chancellor and the ambassador to Austria rushed back to Berlin, and Italy stationed a large army on the border. The situation in various European countries was expected to become serious. Local sentiment believed that this could trigger an international war, and the market immediately fell. However, the Central Bank released 1,400 bars of spot gold, which were aggressively purchased by Fu Taiheng and Rui Kang on behalf of Fu Chang, which helped to pull up the prices. After the official opening, there was still a downward trend, but HSBC aggressively bought sterling, and buyers became active at lower prices. Although major players frequently sold off, the gold market was still able to maintain stability. The gold price was 1006 yuan and two jiao, and the swap spread was three yuan and three or four jiao. Here is a record of the market conditions for the day:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 992 yuan and two jiao, a rise of six jiao compared to the previous close. Spot prices opened at two yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with a recent selling price of one shilling, four pence and .0625 for British exchange, and 33 yuan and .8125 for American exchange. Fuyu, Yifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yicheng, and Lai sold. McGary came out with 34 yuan for September US dollars, and 1.875 for November, falling to .04 jiao. Shanghai bought October US dollars at .125. Yuqing, Yongyuan, Mao, Yongjing, and Fuyongde bought at lower prices, rising to 1.5 yuan. Pan Gen sold October US dollars at .0625, and Dadecheng sold at .07 jiao, while Hengyu bought, reaching 1.3 jiao. At this time, the HSBC exchange rate posting was revealed, but it remained unchanged, hovering around one yuan. Qian Changxiang was on the selling side, while Yongli bought. Later, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Dingtai, Ruikang, Hongkang, Yongcuitai, Zhaofeng, Changbingxing, etc., all had appetites, gradually rising to 2.5 yuan. Jiaotong sold October US dollars at .0625, and Fuxing, Yongda, and Decheng sold strips, falling to 1.6 yuan. After this, the situation stabilized with no change. When the Seattle silver price reported a decrease of .125, Zhaofeng, Chang, and Yicheng slightly bought, rising to 2.1 yuan. However, Zhejiang sold October US dollars at .062 yuan, and Fuxing, Yongyongli, Yuqingyong, etc., sold off, retreating to .08 jiao. Tianfeng and Fuxingyong slightly bought at lower prices, and the market stabilized, rising to 1.6 yuan. Cuitai came to sell, once retreating to within one yuan. The noon close was at 991 yuan, and the spot price was .05 jiao. After the close, Qian Changxiang, Jiatai, Fuxingyong, Tongyisheng, Datianfeng, and Yongxian sold, falling to within 90 yuan, due to Reuters news of the deterioration in Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Reuters continued to transmit unfavorable news, and the market became fearful, fearing that it would affect the global situation. Therefore, the market was weak. The Seattle night silver market rose by .25. The market opened at 86 yuan, but rose to 7.5 yuan under the aggressive buying by Fu Taiheng and Rui Kang. The opening price was 987 yuan and one jiao, and spot prices opened at seven yuan. Selling sentiment was excited, and Dadecheng, Yuansheng, Yongfuxingyong, Hongxing, Hengtai, etc., all sold, falling from 7.3 jiao to 5.3 jiao. Fu Taiheng and Fuchang aggressively bought, and Bingxing also bought, rising to 6.5 jiao. Fuyu, Tianfengyong, Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yonglai, etc., sold again, falling to 5.2 jiao. Fuchang, Yuanchangyong, Qian Changxiang, Yifeng, Yongshunli, and Zhaofengchang bought strips together, rising back to 6.8 jiao. McGary and Mitsui sold September US dollars at .125. Fu Taiheng, Hengyu, Tianfengyong, Yuqingyong, Yuansheng, Yong sold again, falling to 5.6 jiao. Mumbai reported no change. Shunli, Fuxingyong, Huixiang, Yifengyong, Qian Changxiang, etc., continued to buy at lower prices, rising to 6.9 jiao. However, market sentiment was not strong, and Fuxingyong, Yuqingyong, Yuansheng, etc., still supplied, falling to 5.6 jiao. Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, Yuanmaoyong, etc., all had buying appetite. After this, the market became a stagnant situation, while Yuanchangyong and Yuansheng sold, struggling at six yuan. The morning close was at 986 yuan and three jiao, and the spot price was 6.5 jiao. After the close, spot prices, Fuyu, Fuxingyong, etc., all stabilized by buying. The highest price for the day was 992.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 985.2 yuan, a fluctuation of 7.3 yuan. As a result, it fell by five yuan and three jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on the HSBC exchange rate posting, which remained unchanged at 33 yuan and .625 for US dollars, resulting in a standard gold price of 1,029 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was about 43 yuan less, which was 5 yuan more than the previous close. The August ledger price was 995 yuan, and the September price was 991 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 995 yuan, and the afternoon supplementary water was 990 yuan. The gold price was 1006 yuan and two jiao. Spot goods were still arriving. Yesterday, about 2,000 taels of Dong goods and more than 2,000 taels of Jin goods arrived. Trading in the market was stable, and only the Tianjin gang sold 910 taels to Yingfengheng, with an additional 15 yuan. Not many swap transactions were made. Tongyi and Dadecheng posted 7 strips at 3 yuan and 3 jiao each to Yingfengheng, Yuanmaoyong posted 21 strips to Tongfenheng at the same price, and Ruikang and Jinfu posted 3 yuan and 4 jiao to Tongfenheng.

Ruikang and Fu Taiheng each allocated 700 bars at a price of 987.5 yuan. There were 17,304 August strips remaining, with a total of nine long positions and twenty-seven short positions.</p>
<p>The market was initially stable but later chaotic. In summary, Tianfengyong, Yuqingyong, Yuansheng, Yuanchangyong, Yingfengheng, Zhengchang, Tongchun, Shenkang, Yuanmaoyong, Hengtai, Dachangxiang, Huixiang, Fuan, Hongxing, Shunli, etc., were on the selling side, while Yifengyong, Hengyu, Shunmao, Fu Taiheng, Ruikang, Tianfeng, Qian Changxiang, Senchangyong, Dingtai, Tongtaichang, Fuchang, Jinfu, Bingxing, Zhaofengchang, etc., were on the buying side.

<p>The silver dollar market this year has been sluggish, which is unprecedented in previous years. The silk and tea season in spring did not improve, and the spring harvest was poor after entering summer. The financial prosperity period in the first half of the year has been completely exhausted. In this situation, it is difficult to develop the financial market. Therefore, the market has been lifeless for several months, and various market prices have been less active. Yesterday's silver dollar discount rate remained at five points, with both draw heads and water adding up to two points. The turnover of transfer and new transactions in the early market of discounted bills was more than 3.7 million, the turnover in the noon market was more than 200,000, the turnover in the small general meeting was more than 300,000, the turnover of silver dollar mortgages was more than 300,000 for taking redemptions and more than 700,000 for new deals.

<p>96 Temporarily Stabilizes Due to Short Covering</p>
<p>The Trend May Still Gradually Weaken</p>
<p>No Trading for July Delivery Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, July 26th, the Chinese Securities Exchange, the government bond market, was very stable. Initially, due to the lack of sorting out information about 96, which had been revealed in the newspapers, market sentiment was very uncertain. Later, due to the rise of short covering from the Northern gang, the market price of 96 tended to stabilize, and market sentiment turned firm again. The trend may be temporarily stable, but the situation of 96 is dangerous, which may cause a sharp decline. Yesterday, the market was weak at the opening in the morning, and all items were slightly down. Due to the dangerous waves of 96, the situation began to firm up due to the enthusiastic short covering from this gang. In the secondary market, due to the stability of 96, the market suddenly turned stable and firm, and the market price rebounded by one or two jiao, and 96 rebounded by as much as three or four jiao. The market price still rose by several jiao. There was no trading for July futures delivery today. The total turnover was 11.75 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e257">New York Stock Market Rebounds After Long Fall <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York stock market yesterday (25th) first fell due to the liquidation of trading accounts with insufficient margin, and then turned firm due to the unusually hot weather and strong wheat prices. The rebound in the market may be partly due to the inevitable reaction after days of sharp declines, but speculators claimed that this movement was not a true rebound, because trading was unusually light when prices were good. Small exchanges and bond markets were mixed. The total turnover for the day was 1.35 million shares. The New York agent of this company reported that the market absorbed the thrown-out stocks, which was very lively. The market rebounded in the afternoon, and it seemed that it would continue to rise. Wheat fell in the early morning, but rose due to purchases in the eastern United States. The weather in the spring wheat area was cooler than before, but there was no heavy rain. In terms of position, it was very suitable to buy when prices fell. Cotton: There will be strong winds and rain near "Bianposke Cristi" in the inland. According to private news, there was rainfall in Texas, but the market was balanced by the rain because the temperature was still high. Rubber: The interest of colleagues and consumers has increased, and it seems that it will tend to rise. Grains: According to Mr. Maolai, an American grain expert, the corn crop will be 1.7 billion bushels, which is beneficial to the long side. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market was stable in the morning and fell in the afternoon. Due to the softening of American cotton, and the delivery price of the July period on the previous day was higher, market sentiment was weak, and sellers were active. The current yarn business in the market was still good, but slightly less than the previous day. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Austrian Chancellor was assassinated, and the European situation was likely to change. American cotton was unfavorable and fell, so the selling trend rose again, and the price fell.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Standard Yarn Retraces, Strong One Yuan <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>The standard yarn opened in the morning, and American cotton rose slightly by one to four pounds, and Indian cotton fell by two and a half rupees. The atmosphere was calm and unremarkable, and there was little to be excited about. Transactions were quite rare. The price rose by two or three jiao each month, and after snapping up two or three rounds, it fell back by a jiao or two. As a result, each month rose by two jiao. The afternoon opening was still stable, and the market was suddenly tired when snapping up to the close. The situation was particularly weak, because raw cotton tended to fall, and the yarn market was affected, resulting in more liquidations. Each month fell by one yuan to 1.4 jiao. Statistics of the total number of transactions throughout the day: 26,600 bales. Senkang sold 800 bales, Ruidai 950 bales, Yuandai 1,000 bales, Shenji 1,000 bales, Daji 550 bales, Junchang 710 bales, Taichang 600 bales, Changfeng 3,500 bales, and Xiesheng 505 bales.

<p>The sales of current yarn are still good. A check of all-day purchases shows a total of 1,010 packages. The market prices are similar to the previous day, with purchases coming from various groups:</p>
<p>Sichuan 150, Shantou 40, Jiangxi 60, Anqing 10, Inland 230, Yunnan 180, Guangdong 25, Wuhu 30, Ningbo 15, Luzhou 40, Changsha 10, Northern Group 65.</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose but then fell, showing a rather weak trend. The American and Indian cotton markets were both quiet, leading to a softening of sentiment. In addition, the closing price for the July futures was weaker, and sellers became more eager to sell. At the same time, due to poor yarn prices, cotton mills reduced production, making a quick recovery unlikely. Therefore, the demand for raw cotton was very sluggish. According to news from various sources, the new cotton crop is developing well, so the market remains weak.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Zheng Standard Cotton Futures Fall by Three to Four Jiao <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the cotton futures market, although foreign cotton prices were down, new sellers were not seen rushing in, so the market felt tight. Prices for all months rose by one to one and a half jiao. In the afternoon session, Japanese traders closed out long positions. At the same time, news spread that the Austrian Prime Minister had been assassinated, causing unrest in Europe and negatively impacting American cotton. Fears of a price drop arose, leading to a surge of selling as people panicked, and prices fell sharply. Sentiment was quite weak. As a result, old crop cotton fell by 4.5 jiao, and new crop cotton fell by 3 jiao. Total daily trading volume was 85,900 dan. Sales: Xie Sheng 2,200 dan, Chang Feng 2,900 dan, Tai Chang 3,200 dan, Jun Chang 2,600 dan, Heng Yi 2,000 dan, Yuan Da 1,300 dan, Geng Feng 3,100 dan, Yi Chang 2,500 dan, Chang He 6,100 dan, Yi Cheng 1,000 dan, Yu Kang 1,300 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to poor cotton production and increased buying, but later turned weak. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, and futures rose by one to three points. British cotton futures fell by two points. Indian cotton was weak due to long liquidation, resulting in a fall of 1.5 rupees for Pingal and Oomra, and 1.75 rupees for White Raw Creek. The original telegrams are recorded below (dated 25th):</p>

<p>Rumors of Large Imports of Foreign Flour</p>
<h3 id="e265">Sharp Drop in Flour and Wheat Futures <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for all months showed a sudden downward trend. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago improved by about five jiao, and in Canada by about four jiao. However, after the opening prices, the market suddenly turned bearish. Faced with soaring prices in recent days, various mills were eager to sell, and these solid offers attracted the attention of speculators. At the same time, rumors circulated that the government's borrowed flour, about 600,000, would be imported soon, which worsened the situation. Near and far contracts all declined, and after the second session, due to heavy selling by long positions, the decline intensified. Near and far contracts all fell by three to four fen. After the fourth session, the trend stabilized. Customer demand was still active, and rumors about imported borrowed flour were denied by relevant parties, which stabilized long-term sentiment. However, short-term positions continued to be unwound, leading to a weakening trend. Total daily trading was chaotic and exceeded 1.8 million packages, showing the madness of speculation. As a result, this month's contract fell by three fen, August fell by 1.5 fen, September fell by 0.5 fen, October remained unchanged, November fell by 1.5 fen, and December fell by 1.25 fen.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the prices for all months showed an initial flat trend followed by a sharp decline. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago improved by about five jiao, and in Canada by about four jiao. Initially, the market was stable, but by the time the August contract opened, the flour futures market had already changed. The recent decline was quite sharp, which led to a loosening of wheat prices as well. Then, major long positions were unwound, causing the market to fall rapidly. The market has been extremely chaotic recently, with foreign wheat falling but local wheat rising the day before yesterday, and foreign wheat rising but local wheat falling yesterday. The fluctuations are irregular and purely driven by speculators. As a result, this month's contract fell by three fen, August fell by five fen, September and October fell by eight fen, November fell by nine fen, and December fell by eight fen. Spot wheat sales remained smooth, reaching over 30,000 packages. Bids from various firms fell slightly by three to four fen, mostly through direct trading by brokers.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Stability in the River Downstream Rice Market <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supply from various groups was similar to the previous day, totaling only 11-12 shipments (about 2,000 shi). After these two days of scarcity, sentiment stabilized. Shops along this street made some purchases, and shipments of Qin Huangdao rice also continued, with over 300 packages arriving. The market was relatively stable. The rice sold in the morning market was priced lower due to the soft market conditions at the time. However, the prices for most of the thick japonica and late rice remained unchanged. As for Du Yang Jian and Bian Yuan varieties, transactions were limited, and prices were only slightly lower.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over ten shipments arrived from various places downstream. White japonica early rice was stable in the morning market, and active in the afternoon market. The market price for white japonica was one to two jiao higher, while the price for early thin rice was weaker by about one jiao. The prices for other rice varieties were stable.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Customer Xian Rice Turns Upward <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Customer Xian rice market suddenly turned upward. The reason was that the authorities indicated that the purchase of foreign rice would depend on the amount of rice in domestic storage and was not necessary for the time being. Although a few deals were secretly arranged, tax exemptions would be difficult to obtain, so people's sentiment gradually stabilized. Moreover, the weather had turned dry again, and disasters were prevalent everywhere. Speculators could not help but think of manipulating the market. Yesterday, there was some momentum for trading inland, and the situation showed an upward trend. A total of 1,200 packages of Hunan Ji Jing rice, 650 packages of Pi Jing rice, 200 packages of coarse Jing rice, and 284 packages of Nanjing Xian rice were offered. Market sentiment was closely tied to the price of foreign rice, and the rice market temporarily came to an end. Various parties were thinking of taking action. Yesterday, the North Ocean Group started to handle 300 packages of small ground rice, which boosted morale. As a result, purchases increased in this street, with a total of 6,000 packages of small ground rice being offered, priced at 8.25 to 8 yuan, and the market also showed signs of improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Both Soybeans and Oil Rise, Cake Market Stabilizes <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Jiujiang Hongqiao beans open at 3.4 yuan. Recently, the oil market has risen due to price increases in production areas, which has boosted local morale. With both supply and storage scarce, prices have risen successively. The soybean market remained high and active yesterday, and the mills' appetite for purchases was strong, which continued to drive up the market. Total market volume for various soybean types was about 20 truckloads. Please refer to the market price section for prices. The decline in new beans has also stabilized. Jiujiang Chengmen beans attracted interest from Guangdong traders, so morale turned upward. A total of over 900 packages were traded in the city, priced from 3.65 to 3.7 yuan, and were taken by the Guangdong, Ningbo, and local traders. The first batch of Jiujiang Hongqiao beans, totaling 53 packages, arrived and were of dry, shriveled quality. They opened at 3.4 yuan and were purchased by Ningbo traders. The Fuzhou traders are also involved in joint sales of these beans, but they have not yet inquired about them, so the future situation is difficult to predict. Hankou Fenqing beans lacked interest. June white beans were flat. Although there were continued sales of bean cakes (over 20,000 pieces were traded yesterday), most people were unwilling to see further price increases, so the trend turned towards stabilization.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was stable, with little fluctuation in customs gold. The association's listed prices for coarse granulated white spot were 19.9 yuan, local stock 20 yuan, Dutch red 15.2 yuan, Taikoo Sugar B Mark 20.4 yuan, HX Mark 19.6 yuan, and re-export 6.3 yuan to 6.27 yuan. The local factory's fine white sugar was stable, with No. 1 still at 19 yuan. Transactions in Chaozhou Qing sugar increased slightly, with a total of over 400 packages offered. Ti Zhuang Qing was 13.8 yuan, Huanggang Qing was 13.3 yuan to 13.25 yuan, and Ban Nan Qing was 12.8 yuan to 12.75 yuan.</p>

<p>New black watermelon seeds have now arrived, and the prices are extremely cheap. Xu Kui seeds initially opened at 10 yuan, and yesterday continued to open at 8.5 yuan to 8.8 yuan, with lower quality goods. The bright, high-quality goods opened at 9.2 yuan. Mingguang seeds have also been shipped, and the seeds are soft. They initially opened at 7 yuan yesterday, and rose to 7.3 yuan in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Summer is usually the off-season for asphalt. However, in the last ten years, soap factories have provided a market, so it is not completely deserted during the hot season. But this summer is like the situation ten years ago. Because butter, coconut oil, and other products can also be used to make soap, and their prices are lower than asphalt, asphalt has been completely defeated by them. Therefore, the asphalt market this summer can be described as clean as a whistle. Although inventories are reported to be thin everywhere, sales rely entirely on candle-making. Once candle production stops, almost no one cares about the market, and the market is weak and uninspired. Details from Hankou in recent days also indicate that sales have stalled. Local brokers have very little inventory, and the only thing that supports the market is small soap factories, with only 20-30 deals. The selling price is 16.64 yuan per dan for Chongjing, about 16 yuan for Pingjing, 15.24 yuan for Macheng oil, and only 15 yuan for customer oil from Jiangxi and other places.</p>

<p>After the "Lu Zhuang Zhen Mei" green tea market declined a few days ago, the situation has become more active. Yesterday, British firms such as Xie He, Yi He, Jin Long, Bao Chang, and the China Tea Company actively searched for goods from Tunxi, Shexian, and Wudong, and trading was not deserted. However, the market for Zhen Mei from Wuyuan North Road and goods from Yushan Kaihua remained sluggish. The sales of black tea from Qining and other regions have also become sluggish. Goods from Hunan and Hubei provinces have recently been shipped to Shanghai with new samples, and various European firms have been sending telegrams to solicit sales, but the listed prices are four to five yuan lower than before.</p>

<h3 id="e274">The Shanghai Silk Factory Industry is in Imminent Danger <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>(Most Silk Factories are Preparing to Stop Work) After spring cocoons entered the market this year, silk sales by foreign firms in Shanghai showed activity, and the price of Grade B white factory silk once rose to over 500 yuan. However, the cost of new cocoons was only 470-480 yuan per bale. Silk and cocoon merchants profited from this, and many rented factories to start processing new cocoons. However, this was short-lived and soon crashed. European and American markets were dumping Japanese silk at low prices, causing the price of Grade B Shanghai white factory silk to fall to 412 yuan per bale. Currently, most of the 33 silk factories operating in the city are short-term operations or processing for others. Their leases are only for three to four months. Due to the lack of buyers for stored silk, each factory reels an average of two dan of silk per day. If sold at current market prices, each factory would lose over 100 yuan per day. It is impossible to sustain this, so they have to sacrifice the rent and prepare to stop production. Over ten factories are expected to stop work by the end of this month.</p>
<p>(Stagnant Sales of Yellow and White Waste Silk to England) High-quality waste silk from China (such as yellow and white long-fiber waste silk, hand-pulled waste silk, etc.) is popular among British firms. After new cocoons entered the market this year, Japanese waste silk (i.e., silk waste) was dumped in England at low prices, causing the sales of Chinese waste silk to England to decline daily. Yellow and white long-fiber waste silk has rarely been exported recently. The last two postal ships, Lan Zhi and others, did not carry any waste silk to Bombay and England.</p>
<p>(Extremely Sluggish Sales of Silk in Europe and America) Overseas raw silk markets are seeing continuous dumping of Japanese silk, and factory sales have stalled. Silk prices in New York, Lyon, and other places are gradually decreasing. The Shanghai silk market shows no sign of improvement, and the market is extremely sluggish. Yesterday, only European firms took advantage of the low prices to replenish stocks, with Yi He and others purchasing 40 bales of dried silk, but this was not a formal market transaction.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Praying for Rain Brings Rain <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Recently, drought has plagued various places. Jiangnan and Zhejiang have had no rain for over a month. Although there have been a few showers in the past few days, they have been insufficient. It can be said that prayers have been answered.</p>
<p>Drought, drought, drought is afflicting various places. Following the drought, there are rituals to welcome the gods and set up altars to pray for rain. Especially in Shanghai, up to the day before yesterday, there were over five or six major venues set up to pray for rain. These were all presided over by prominent figures. I believe there are many other prayer gatherings that are not known. Everyone at these venues is sincerely praying for rain, hoping that their sincerity will move the heavens to send down abundant rain. This is not unique to China; even the United States, known for its scientific and material civilization, is now practicing a ban on slaughtering animals to pray for rain. This cannot be said to be a strange thing.</p>
<p>However, it is not really that strange. The modern capitalist civilization, which developed because of modern industry, has reached the point of declaring bankruptcy today. The destruction of capitalism has caused all the ideologies built upon it to shake. As capitalist civilization shakes, it has to return to the ancient family of religion, asking religion for help, giving it a mystical facade. Religion was originally strongly opposed by capitalist civilization, but that was when capitalism was in its prime. Now that capitalism is old and weak, it needs religion to help it. Without the help of religion, it really cannot linger. That is why praying to the gods for rain is also prevalent in the United States today. As the saying goes, "When people are poor, they call on heaven; when they are sick, they call on their parents." This is a futile measure.</p>
<p>As for China's prayer for rain, although it is an old method passed down for thousands of years, it was clearly ineffective in recent years. The continuous destruction of temples in various places in the past few years is one example. Recently, this idea of using gods to teach has been revived. The revival of things like religious gatherings and welcoming-the-gods festivals, as well as the recent prayer for rain in various places, have all been innovated and turned into one of the social and cultural movements of recent years. This is not without meaning. Although this meaning is different in degree from the use of religion by capitalist civilization, its essence is not very different. This is why superstition has been particularly rampant in China in recent years, and where it comes from.</p>
<p>Historically, abrupt changes are approaching day by day. As a result, all anti-scientific ideals are flourishing more and more. But this anti-scientific ideal will certainly not stop the progress of science in the end. This is undoubtedly true. Do not say that praying for rain brings rain, and that the gods have supreme authority.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Escaping the Heat <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>The weather is really hot! The sun is so scorching; it's unbearable. Let's all go on a heat escape trip!</p>
<p>Yes, it's hot, let's go on a heat escape trip: Laoshan in Qingdao, Moganshan in Hangzhou, Lushan and Guling in Jiangxi, Putuo in the South China Sea, etc., are all famous summer resorts. There, one can find the footprints of dignitaries and the tracks of gentlemen.</p>
<p>Going on a heat escape trip is a privilege enjoyed only by the noble and the bourgeois. The laboring masses, who are oppressed by life every day, do not have this privilege, especially poor guys like me who cannot eat their fill or keep warm! I can forget about having this opportunity.</p>
<p>Heat is for everyone, but of course, a few wealthy classes and high officials are exceptions. Even I am equally afraid of the heat. Watching others go on heat escape trips and stay in air-conditioned rooms makes me a little jealous. So, I made a great vow to the heavens, gritting my teeth, and I wanted to try the taste of escaping the heat. Going to Lushan or Moganshan is beyond my means: a poor guy's year of sweat and blood is not enough to cover a month's worth of heat escape. This kind of unrealistic dream will never come true. Dreaming into the distant future is still a dream!</p>
<p>So, where was I going to go? This question kept swirling in my mind. As a result, after several days and nights of thinking, I finally decided to run to the countryside to escape the heat. Summer in the countryside may be better than in the city, with a quiet environment and fresh air, but without the noise, dust, and alluring sounds of the city.</p>
<p>Now, I have temporarily left the life in the city and escaped to the countryside, which the great gentlemen are unwilling to go to, to spend the summer. When this summer is over, I will return to the city. There, I would like to write some random notes about rural life. Perhaps, in these notes, I can tell some strange stories and ordinary news to the people in the city. Goodbye! People in the city! I wish you eternally sipping that pink wine.</p>
<p>Only two days after I returned to the countryside, my friend Shen Junlvping wrote a letter to me. He said in his letter:</p>
<p>"Xiafei: Are you happy living in the mountains? Since I came to Shanghai, it has been two weeks. But in my dreams, I still often miss Shigong. The inscriptions on the wall, I will wait until next year when the peach blossoms bloom to enjoy them with you again.</p>
<p>Living deep in the forests and springs, without the noise of carriages and horses, with the joy of mountains and rivers, secular thoughts are washed away, and the mind is open. It is no wonder you always envy the countryside and hate the city. What I hate is that we are driven by hunger and cannot help ourselves. We work hard all day long, relying on others to make a living, and we cannot enjoy this pure happiness in the world..." (This spring, I traveled with him to Shigong. His article was published in the "New Shanghai" section of the Shishi Xinbao. This time I returned to my hometown, and he happened to come to Shanghai only two weeks ago.)</p>
<p>Indeed, playing with the children during the day and lying by the south window at night, drinking three cups of wine when there is nothing to do, and leisurely reciting the poems of the ancients, this situation is no less than that of the ancient Emperors. I think the masses in the city cannot enjoy this kind of pure happiness.</p>
<p>Life in the countryside is regulated, and it can even be said to be mechanized. Although I have only been in the countryside for three short days, I have deeply felt its boundless charm.</p>
<p>Therefore, before sunrise or in the shadows of the setting sun, by the lake and in the woods, my footprints often appear.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Ghosts and Gods <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Juefu</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because we were born in the most scientifically advanced twentieth century, and everyone has been somewhat touched by the baptism of science, so we always think that people who piously pray to the gods to eliminate disasters and bring blessings are the most ignorant! We use science as the basis to oppose superstition in ghosts and gods, and of course no one dares to question this. However, human beings are, after all, a product of philosophy. People are always seeking an explanation for everything in the universe (whether theological or scientific), and people's souls are always seeking a home. Even a person who is perfectly clear that there are no such things as ghosts and gods in the world will often think of ghosts and gods when they are at their wit's end and have no way out. A revolutionary leader, when frustrated or unable to handle things, and unable to trust himself, will often seek divination to determine good or bad fortune (according to reports, Hitler recently consulted with fortune tellers); a famous scientist, when seriously ill and all medicines are ineffective,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>if people pray to God to bless him, he will be comforted, which is the same reason.</p>
<p>We Chinese, as everyone knows, have always been very tolerant of foreign religions. Many foreign heresies cannot stand their ground in their birthplace, but once they are imported into China, they can become popular everywhere without hindrance. People only think that China has always taken a "broad-minded" attitude, so that is why there are such results. In fact, the miserable lives of the Chinese people are indeed a major reason.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the disastrous drought and heat, and the resulting epidemic, welcoming the gods to pray, and banning slaughter to pray for rain has again become prevalent everywhere. A group of people living in foreign buildings and eating big meals only criticize people's ignorance and lament deeply: "China will not perish, what is the reason for this!" However, seeing the rice seedlings, which are fattening, withering in the scorching sun, and having no way to provide relief, who would not be anxious? Watching one strong comrade after another collapsing and dying in the scorching sun, and there is no hospital willing to provide accommodation and treatment, who would not be panicked? If they do not even have a little hope in ghosts and gods, they will either sit and die anxiously, or change their ways!</p>

<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>Dear Brother:</p>
<p>Now I'm starting to regret it! Why did I come to school? I especially shouldn't have left my loving mother and beautiful hometown to study in this wicked city!</p>
<p>Brother, my environment is terrible! In my class, there are thirty-four people, only five of whom are girls. The twenty-nine male classmates are like robbers! They don't know what they think we are! Not only are the classmates in my grade like this, but the classmates in other grades are also the same. Especially me, they seem like they want to swallow me whole. They are truly cruel to me!</p>
<p>During the first few days of school, I was able to study peacefully, but after a week, all the classmates gradually started paying attention to me! During class, they always stared at me, quietly talking about me. It was even worse after class. I couldn't escape their frightening gazes for a moment. Brother, I'm really scared! I never imagined that things like this would happen at school. If I had known, I would never have dared to come to school.</p>
<p>Later, they not only stared at me with terrifying eyes, but they were always looking for a chance to get close to me. Sometimes, if I dropped a pencil, they would scramble to pick it up for me, respectfully hand it to me, and even smile at me. (I'm really scared of their smiles!) During exams, they would send me all the answers they had completed, one by one. Brother, what does this mean? Don't they want me to be able to answer the questions on my own? Also, they don't call me by my name, nor do they call me "woman" or "Miss," but they call me "Angel." Brother, what does "Angel" mean? Do you understand? Alas, I really don't know what's going on!</p>
<p>After that, some people even started writing me letters, using colorful paper and writing in neat fountain pen, with at least three pages per letter. There were many words I couldn't understand, mostly compliments, and they all hoped to be friends with me. At first, I really didn't know what to do. Really, brother, aren't I fifteen years old? I've never encountered anything like this before! Later, I thought it wouldn't hurt to make friends, so I wrote them back. Who knew that the letters would increase day by day? Every day when I passed the gatehouse, I could get at least ten letters. What am I supposed to do? I can't write letters all day long! And I simply don't want to read some of the letters, all full of "My dear," "Beautiful little bird," and other nauseating words. Finally, I decided to ignore them all, burning every letter that came without even looking at it. Brother, isn't that a good idea? Who knew that the letters would only increase? Some scolded, some begged, some attacked... Later, they even brazenly made a scene on the bulletin board! Alas, I dare not even think about it! As I write this letter, my hands are still shaking, my heart is still pounding, and I can no longer hold back my tears!</p>
<p>Brother, how can you expect me to study peacefully! Now summer vacation is here again, but what have I gained in these six months? Alas, I truly want to cry but have no tears, want to laugh but have no voice!</p>
<p>Brother, my dream of studying is shattered. I don't want to go to school anymore. School is simply a man-eating demon! I'd rather be with my beloved mother in my sweet hometown than run to the city to see the demon's gaping maw!</p>
<p>Brother, I never expected studying to be like this!</p>
<p>Your sister,</p>

<p>— Wen Gai</p>
<p>Literary works are like a piece of clothing. Those who focus on the ideological content say the fabric should be of good quality, durable, and fit well; those who focus on technique and form say the fabric should be beautiful, and the style should be fashionable and pretty. The result is: beautiful and fashionable clothes appeal to the general public; whether they are durable or not, people don't care at all, and the literary theorists who focus on technique and form triumph, making the literary theorists who focus on ideological content angrily scold the readers as "unworthy of being taught." In fact, clothes that are both of good quality and durable, and also fashionable and beautiful, appealing to both aspects, are even more popular. Isn't it the same with literary works?</p>
<p>Today's literary writers are just like apprentice tailors: they have to make clothes to make a living. And some are still churning out shoddy work, cutting corners.</p>
<p>Writers who haven't made a name for themselves write with the flourish of dragons and phoenixes, completing their work in an instant, even finishing a novel of hundreds of thousands of words in three days; writers who have become famous, however, find their inspiration dried up, unable to write even a short essay in three days. Works by writers who haven't made a name for themselves are unwanted, while writers who have become famous still can't deliver their pre-arranged articles. As a result, the market price of savage heads becomes more and more expensive, and the resentment of unknown writers soars to the sky.</p>
<p>Both contributors and editors are people who suffer no small amount. It is certainly bitter for contributors to have their manuscripts rejected, but it is even more bitter for editors to have no good manuscripts to edit!</p>

<h3 id="e280">Love and Marriage <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>You are a good mentor in society. You always answer our difficult problems with good and beautiful methods, so I admire you very much.</p>
<p>Now I have a difficult matter to ask you for help with. Please reply as soon as possible. The matter is as follows:</p>
<p>I have a friend named Wang, who is around twenty years old and currently working as a trainee at a foreign firm. Two months ago, through a friend's introduction, he met a girlfriend named Jiang, who is currently studying at a certain elementary school. She has an elderly mother with white hair and an older brother at home, and no one else. Her family is very old-fashioned, but her mind is the opposite of her family, and she is very sociable.</p>
<p>Since they were introduced by a friend, they have been in harmony with each other, and there is a "feeling of regretting not having met sooner." They are often seen in movie theaters and parks.</p>
<p>Not long ago, her affair was discovered by her older brother. Although my friend has not had any physical relationship with her, her family is old-fashioned and made the following demands: "My friend must agree to make her his lifelong partner (marriage), or he must compensate for damages to her reputation," etc. My friend's family is also old-fashioned, so he cannot make his own decisions about his marriage, and he currently lacks the ability to support himself. In this dilemma, I implore you, sir, to help resolve this matter and list the four questions below:</p>
<p>(1) Should he agree to the marriage proposal?</p>
<p>(2) After agreeing, how can he get his family to approve of the marriage request?</p>
<p>(3) If he does not agree and her family resolves the matter through legal means, will he be guilty of any crime, and will the introducer be guilty?</p>
<p>(4) If he does not agree, what methods can he use to continue interacting with her?</p>
<p>Please answer the above questions in detail, one by one. I wish you good health and peace,</p>
<p>Respectfully, Yan Ying</p>
<p>Answer: Marriage is the destination of love, so when a man and woman are about to embark on the path of love, they should consider in advance whether there is a possibility of marriage in the future. It is most dangerous to blindly pursue love if there is no possibility. Your friend did not consider in advance whether he had the qualifications to independently discuss marriage. He only saw that free love was fashionable and rashly followed suit. Now he has gotten himself into trouble, and I cannot help but say that he is too muddled. Moreover, when a man and woman are passionately in love, they will inevitably seek marriage. If there are obstacles to marriage, they must do everything in their power to overcome them. There is absolutely no such thing as hesitating and wavering when hearing someone urge them to get engaged. Because of this point, I strongly suspect that your friend's love for Miss Jiang is only the pursuit of sexual love, without the sincerity of emotional love. Therefore, I originally wanted to throw the letter you wrote on his behalf into the wastebasket and ignore it; especially the fourth question, which is the most absurd. But then I thought that your friend is only a young man of about twenty years old, with little experience in dealing with the world. If I do not point out a proper way for him and let him do things in a confused manner, the situation will definitely get worse and worse, and I am afraid that there are not a few people who have this kind of problem. So I specifically decided to give a public answer.</p>
<p>I think your friend should quickly decide on his own course of action based on the following principles: First, he should carefully reflect and observe whether he truly loves that lady and whether that lady is his ideal partner. If so, he should agree immediately without hesitation. On the one hand, he should also communicate with his family. Even if the communication fails, it does not matter, because marriage is his own business, and after adulthood, he has the right to decide for himself, without the need for family consent. If not, the previous relationship only arose from sexual love, then he should break off cleanly from now on. Your friend has had no physical relationship with the lady, so he is not guilty of any crime. However, because your friend does things in a very unreliable manner, I must give one final piece of advice, which is that if he agrees to the other party but his family does not approve, he should always remember the responsibility he will have to bear for his family in the future and quickly find a way to become self-sufficient.</p>

<p>— Written by Bulgarian Ivan Vazov, Translated by Yang Sen</p>
<p>The two children stood as if rooted to the ground. Several hours had passed. The wind blowing from the mountains became more fierce; it whipped the children's faces and fluttered their clothes. Snow whirled around them, but they did not flinch. Their faces remained fixed on the horizon, hoping to find a living soul. Suddenly, China's heart leaped. In the distance, a troop of cavalry could be seen galloping towards them. How many soldiers there were! Surely her older brother was among them! She waited motionless. The men rode swiftly past, noisily passing the children by, continuing on their way.</p>
<p>China waved at two soldiers at the rear of the troop:</p>
<p>"Captain!" she cried, her voice full of tears. "Has our brother come?"</p>
<p>The two officers stopped, looking at her in surprise.</p>
<p>"Who is your brother?" one of the officers asked.</p>
<p>"Brother Stoyan, our brother Stoyan," Raducho cried impatiently, wondering how the dignified officer could not know that Stoyan was their brother.</p>
<p>"What Stoyan?" the officer asked.</p>
<p>"Stoyan from the city of Weitlun," China replied firmly.</p>
<p>The officer whispered a few words to his companion, then asked again with interest, "Is your brother in the cavalry?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," the poor child replied, not understanding the question.</p>
<p>"Oh, he's not with us, my poor child. Go home quickly. You'll freeze to death here," the other officer said.</p>
<p>Then, spurs clattering, the two men galloped to catch up with their troop.</p>
<p>China wept, Raducho lamented. Their limbs were numb with cold, their lips had completely lost all sensation. Before them stretched the road back to their village, desolate and forlorn. The people who had come to welcome the returning soldiers had now gone home. Darkness fell, and the wind grew ever more violent. They could only see the cavalry troop galloping away in the distance, the soldiers' joyous songs carried to the children's ears by the wind.</p>
<p>China and Raducho turned back towards the village.</p>
<p>Night had fallen. Hands thrust deep into their pockets, the two children walked in silence, imagining their mother waiting by the door.</p>
<p>The sound of a carriage drawn by three horses rose up behind them.</p>
<p>"Sir, are there any more soldiers coming behind?"</p>
<p>But the carriage sped on, and no one saw or heard them in the darkness.</p>
<p>Snow continued to swirl around them. This snow came from the west, from the battlefield, where the white shroud had already covered Stoyan's grave in the vineyards near Pirot?</p>

<h3 id="e282">A Western Star's Determination to Change His Style) Continued <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Why was Tom Keen willing to listen to a stranger, Kin Vidor, and rashly give up his status as a red-hot star, his high salary, and risk great danger to accept that contract and leave Hollywood? This is certainly a rare thing in Hollywood, which worships money—not just money, but hard cash—but he believed it was right, so he did it. His courage is admirable. Moreover, after a year, he returned to Hollywood as a new man with a new style. He was no longer the reckless ranch hero of the past, but an actor with artistic flair. It must be said that his previous decision was wise, because the style of Western films had reached its twilight, and he had to change his course to survive.</p>
<p>When Kin Vidor met him, he said, "I have a plan: if you're willing to gamble with me, we can gamble... if you feel that your film career needs to start over, this is your chance. You can discuss with the company and buy back the contract. I can guarantee you a leading role in my new film. Furthermore, I can pay you a decent salary until I'm ready to start production." Tom asked, "How long will that take?" Kin Vidor said, "Probably a year. During this year, I don't care where you go or what you do, as long as you leave Hollywood and forget about the studio. You can mingle with real men and women and wash the taste of Hollywood out of your mouth! Erase the thoughts of Hollywood from your mind. First, don't think about Westerns. Also, don't worry about contracts and money. Don't be afraid that people will forget you. Because my intention is for them to forget you. You can learn some acting skills, go on stage for a while. The rest of the time, you can read, rest, and have fun. When the time comes, I'll call you. Then you'll be my star."</p>
<p>The average movie star would never give up a stable position, a reliable future, and a large salary for a small salary for a year, with the film's production still uncertain. But Tom Keen decided to accept Kin Vidor's plan. Within a month, he bought back his contract with the company, rejected all other contracts, and quietly went east. Because he wanted to get far away from Hollywood, he ran to a small town in the far northeast corner of Maine. That small town had a summer theater troupe. That troupe was a gathering place for national stage stars. When summer came, no matter how high their position or how great their reputation, they would come to that place and gather with stars from other regions to study and learn from each other. Their democratic spirit was very strong. Regardless of their status, everyone who performed on stage received a salary of fifty dollars a week. The purpose of the troupe was not to make money, but to establish a hub for actors to congregate. When Tom Keen arrived there, he joined the troupe, rehearsed a play, and worked hard for several months. Later, he left there and traveled all over the country, talking to various people. He strived to live in an environment close to the people and far from the Hollywood lifestyle. He said that he often worried about his future and often lay awake at night staring at the ceiling. Although he trusted Kin Vidor, much could change in a year. Perhaps Kin Vidor's business would fail and he would not be able to fulfill the contract; or perhaps he would be run over by a car, and everything would be over. However, when a year had just passed, Kin Vidor sent him a telegram, calling him to start working, which was the happiest thing he had ever experienced.</p>
<p>As for why he was willing to make such a decision and accept Kin Vidor's proposal, he also had his reasons. The following is what he said himself: "Before Kin Vidor contacted me, I had already been thinking about leaving Hollywood. Kin Vidor simply helped me make the decision. I believe that if a person discovers that they are not on the right path, they should have the courage to sacrifice everything to correct it. Of course, that always means giving up something stable and gambling on the future. I'm not saying that leaving a stable position is painless. At the time, I felt the pain as if I were having a tooth pulled; but if a tooth is decayed, who can bear not to pull it out? At that time, my Western films were still popular, but I always felt that the future was uncertain and without any guarantee. As for the companies, they only considered this type of Western film as a temporary tool to increase their income. Although they were very accommodating to the stars of Western films, they never put any thought or money into cultivating them. They were just waiting for time to eliminate them on their own."</p>
<p>When Kin Vidor met Tom Keen, he had just finished his thirteenth film. But because he realized that he was not on the right path, he resolutely decided to start over, and Kin Vidor's plan only facilitated his ambition. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e283">Review of "Mandalay" <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>

<p>Regarding this film, I feel that apart from Kay Francis's excellent performance, there is nothing else worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Kay Francis is indeed an excellent actress. We have seen many of her starring films, and recently, from "I Found Stella Parish" to "The House on 56th Street," she plays the sorrowful and tragic heroine, deeply capturing the fragile sympathy of the audience. Especially in "The House on 56th Street," because of her own unfortunate life experiences, she sacrifices everything to protect the daughter she abandoned, and because the story is romantic, it helps her lovely success in acting.</p>
<p>Now, this "Mandalay" is once again seizing her sentimental personality. The screenwriter makes her escape from national ruin and family destruction, and then be abandoned by the man she loves. She has no choice but to sell her body. Although she meets a soulmate in the meantime, he is just a drunkard. However, in the end, sorrowful people sympathize with each other. When she kills that heartless man. In this process, she is deeply and realistically portrayed. This, we can find proof in very small places: for example, after she has entered Tony's room next door on the ship, Dr. Burton comes to knock on the door. When she opens the door to receive him, it seems that she should pretend to be happy, but she is still very calm, in order to express her inner grief. From these places, it can be seen that she has a deep understanding of the personality of the character in the play, although this also includes the main ingredients of the director. In addition, she looks out alone at the bow of the ship, the quiet night makes her feel sad, when she sees the doctor drinking recklessly in the bar again, she has to shake her head and sigh secretly, which fully proves that she plays the sentimental scenes very appropriately.</p>
<p>However, in this scene, the quiet sorrow was destroyed in the tone by the director, because from the bow of the ship at night to the front of the bar, the design of Tony's escape is interspersed with simultaneous descriptions: this aspect is a relatively tense tone, which invisibly destroys the quiet sorrow. This is, in any case, the director's lack of grasp.</p>
<p>In general, the director's technique is not very brilliant. We certainly cannot point out more mistakes, but it is just that he has not failed in his duties. Most American directors imagine oriental scenes in the studio, and the Burmese scenery described here is the same as the general description of China, using a kind of exotic and insulting eye, untruthfully deceiving the audience. This is fully expressed in that nightclub. Women in embroidered clothes from the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China are once again appearing in front of Chinese audiences in American films. These untruthful descriptions should always be a loss to artistic works, and an attached explanation of the director's shallowness. The director's cleverness is limited to the delicate handling of individual scenes, the angle of the lens, or the guidance of the actors, which are all commendable, but without a solid grasp of other more important aspects, he will never become an extremely excellent director. However, to put it back, even if such decadent romance is directed better, it may not be needed by the general active audience.</p>
<p>The general story has been described above. The screenwriter's choice of subject matter and even the handling of the subject matter show that his understanding of reality is very superficial. When he writes about Tony, he seems to want the audience to curse his infidelity, so he mentions incidentally that he is selling arms; this seems to expose the conspiracy of imperialists in the colonies, but we must understand that this is completely a subconscious adoption of this material as a description of Tony's improper behavior, and the same is true later when he writes about the policeman's medal hanging on the prostitute's garter, the so-called exposure of the policeman's crime is only for the impropriety of the policeman's exile of the prostitute. And the policeman's face can be bought back with ten thousand yuan. When Tony was poisoned to death by Deah, he actually had a change of heart and jumped into the sea, without making any pre-death struggle. This kind of unrealistic romantic lover makes the audience very sympathetic; although his behavior is not upright, his conscience is ultimately good. Such a contradictory expression is a common disease of general American film writers, and the author of this play is no exception.</p>
<p>There is one point that should be raised as a merit of the playwright, and that is that Deah casually smashed Tony's photo frame, and was slightly injured because of him, so the young doctor came to heal her wound, to symbolize their destiny. Although this is an old technique, it is still somewhat commendable.</p>

<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>Lilian exclaimed again, "Immortal?" Her momentary excitement vanished. She said, "I'd rather die and rot. What I need is a responsible manager. Max Jacobs is getting on the train in Cleveland. I'm going to sign a contract with him." The name Jacobs was unbearable for Jifu. He was once his servant, and now he's a successful producer! He couldn't help but shout, "Max Jacobs! He's a thief! He's an illiterate ignoramus! He can't even write his own name." Lilian laughed wildly, "He writes very well on checks, and very large checks at that!" Jifu roared, "Oh, so all you want is money!" He shook his head with a disdainful air. "You've changed, become a mercenary. But if you want money, I can give it to you too. There's a Mr. Clark, a pill tycoon, who has agreed to bear all financial responsibility, and without limitations!" He ran out and shouted to O'Malley across the hall, "O'Malley, bring that contract here."</p>
<p>The contract was so good that Lilian read it with mixed feelings of doubt and belief. She smiled. Ten thousand dollars paid upfront upon signing the contract… a special dressing room, completely decorated with plain white velvet… a new car, a chauffeur, a maid, a secretary, and everything else, too numerous to mention, some within her dreams, some beyond. O'Malley pointed to each detail, "Honey flows there, sign here quickly." He smiled and handed the fountain pen to Lilian, saying, "This isn't just signing a contract, it's a coronation ceremony. Boxes of jewels, thick carpets to grace your beautiful feet, marble bathtubs, crowds of servants waiting for your call." But Lilian still hesitated, and hesitated for too long. A sudden great commotion broke out in the hallway outside. The train had just arrived at the Cleveland station, and the so-called millionaire, Mr. Clark, saw his nephew coming to pick him up, and suddenly went mad again. The train conductor behind Clark, pushing and shoving him, shouted for him to get off the train. Jifu went out to take a look and couldn't help but rage, "What are you doing? This is Mr. Clark, the former pill tycoon." The conductor said, "I don't know anything else, I only know he's crazy." When Lilian heard this, an expression of extreme panic appeared on her face. She knew she had been deceived again. But the conductor, seeing her panicked expression, quickly explained, "Miss Garland, you don't need to be afraid. He's not dangerous at all... He's quite pitiful. They locked him in an asylum for over a year, but he escaped." The madman suddenly shook off the conductor. He desperately ran forward in the hallway. The conductor, Clark's nephew, and many attendants chased closely behind. Lilian retreated into her room, slammed the door shut, and said fiercely to Jifu, "This is the last time I will speak to you. I have never been so insulted!" Jifu pleaded, "My love, please listen to me. I was also deceived." Lilian turned away and ignored him. At this moment, Max Jacobs had boarded the train to see her. When she saw him, she happily shouted. She shouted a series of affectionate names: "Maxie, Max, my heavenly angel, my darling!" Max said, "I've already booked you for a Samuel Sherman play. My darling, as soon as we get off the train tomorrow, we'll go straight to the lawyer to sign the contract." (To be continued)</p>
