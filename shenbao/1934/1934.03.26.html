<h3 id="c12">太平洋問題之前途　恒 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>美國自羅斯福氏登臺而後。傾全力於國内經濟之復興。其對於遠東問題之態度。迄無明確之表示。如去年於承認蘇俄之後。卽有將太平洋艦隊移調大西洋之聲明。最近國會通過一○二艘之優勢海軍案後。又有願與日本和平談判之換文。態度之一張一弛。幾於不可捉摸。然究其底藴。實採可戰可和之策略。苟能以和平方法解决太平洋之問題。固爲上策。不然。則其海軍仍足應付日本。觀於蘇俄備戰之積極。英國海軍擴充之猛進。新加坡築港之繼續。可知太平洋之戰雲。必待太平洋問題解决後。始能完全消散。否則第二次之大戰。遲早終須爆發。故今日之日美換文。實可視爲九一八以來國際時局之一大轉機。同時因時勢之需求。或可促成第二次太平洋會議之早開也。</p>
<p>溯自日本佔我東北熱河以還。各國在太平洋之勢力。已失其均衡。國聯之决議。旣不足遏日人之野心。史汀生之宣言。亦不足摇日人之意志。蘇俄雖屢有强硬之表示。然其意僅在於自保。英人力持鎭靜。亦有待於海軍力之充實。如是而言制裁日本。自屬無補實際。然爲挽救均勢已破之局面而先開太平洋會議。要爲無辦法中之辦法。卽如一九二二年之華府會議。國人多有稱之爲太平洋會議者。其中有關中國者。如英日同盟之取消。山東問題之斡旋。領土主權完整之確保。門戶開放政策之延續等等。皆有利於我。其有關太平洋覇權之分配者。則有維持英美日法劃分太平洋屬島之四國恊定。又有規定英美日法意五國海軍主力艦比例之海軍恊定。故自其成績言。實爲大戰後和平談判政策之大成功。今若更行召開當能再度打開遠東沈悶之局面也。</p>
<p>就日本對美換文之内容與日軍部之聲明觀之。日本之希望於美國者有三。（一）爲承認僞國。（二）爲海軍比例與英美平等。（三）爲菲島早日獨立。唯美國對之。僅表示願開談判而止。實則此數問題。皆非美日兩國所能單獨解决。允以前二者爲然。若日本貿然要求。其結果或使美國早日召開太平洋會議。藉他國之力以壓抑日本。蓋有關太平洋之國家。除中美日而外。尙有英俄法荷等國。皆忌日本勢力之膨脹。故日本之要求。殆難如願以償。且僞國之不容承認。早爲國聯所决議。在下屆太平洋會議席上。當自不能食言翻案。至於海軍比例之平等。亦必難望英美讓步。蓋英美若能讓步。則近頃竭力擴張海軍之舉。實爲多事。再如菲島之獨立。亦不能謂爲美日單獨所能解决之問題蓋許予菲島獨立。固爲美民主黨一貫之政策。然特限以十二年後始能完全獨立者。實欲乘其尙未獨立之時。作未雨之綢繆。俾其獨立之後。不致落入日本之手耳。故在此一問題未解决前。或將會合太平洋上有勢力之英法荷蘭諸國。共同保證菲島之中立。然後始作提早之放棄。他如門戶開放利益均霑政策之維持。對華貿易投資之恊定。太平洋島嶼之重行分配。亦不失爲會議中之難題。會議而能使各方滿意。則太平洋之戰雲。可以完全消釋。否則英美日俄軍備之競爭。將必較今日爲尤烈也。</p>
<p>吾國自九一八以來。因自身之無辦法。致令東北問題。懸而不决。初猶乞靈國聯。期望美國。迨其悉無效果。則又任其自然。一若更無挽救之道。卽至美日換文修好。猶無絲毫動作。實則召開太平洋會議之機漸熟。吾國若能稍革因人成事之習。似應立卽發動。催開太平洋會議。夫而後研究收回東北熱河之方案。或有具體討論之一日。否則任令强鄰自謀便利。而我獨受犧牲。則最爲可懼者也。</p>

<p>所陳均切要　願政府注意</p>
<p>印度國際大學中文佛學敎師體參君來函稱、此文由我友人從藏中寄來、囑寫奉貴報、以告國人、文中達賴遺囑、爲世人所未知、最可寳貴、請爲發表爲荷、其文如下、</p>
<p>達賴圓寂後、外界少有人知、卽與其臨近之强隣、亦不得其詳、蓋因西藏政府向來規章、達賴出缺、必先呈報中華民國中央政府知悉、（在民元前、先通報内務大臣）而後公諸民衆、故一時外報所傳、均非確實、記者有契友與達賴非常接近、昨得其由藏中來信、囑余寫告國人、</p>
<p>（一）逹賴喇嘛寂滅之日期及其遺囑</p>
<p>達賴去年五十九歳、實圓寂於藏歷四月初三日、（正合我國内廢歷四月初四日、只相差一日、）當其臨寂之時、八答那寺中全體攝隆電巴·及中委班禪之代表等、均在其丈室、約午後四時許、達賴自知將去、卽對其在坐人等、作下列之囑付、</p>
<p>「爾等不聽吾訓誨、吾將去矣、師兄班禪在南京中央有力、應速請彼回、維持政敎、前藏後藏僧民等、應聽班禪之敎誨、中央和平、救吾等之苦惱、於戲、（原爲藏語）</p>
<p>達賴所云「爾等不聽吾之敎訓」者、因其部下有爭權内鬥之事、當達賴寂滅後二十八天内、産生全體僧官代表大會於某寺之時、一至决議、處分監禁宫璧（達賴之重要隨員）其父亦被監禁、並有五個爪牙亦遭拘留、宫璧掌有内務軍事各要權、該大會又有若干其它議題、尚無結果、或將引起重大之内鬥亦未可知、民二十二年達賴所訓練之前後藏各縉紳子弟、約二千人、被宫璧遣散、或卽爲達賴致疾之一因也、</p>
<p>（二）搽隆之捲逃</p>
<p>按搽隆乃達賴前期之心腹、向佔權勢、其所剥削民衆獲得之欵項、均存英殖民地、此次達賴寂滅、彼忽潛逃江孜英人軍營中、殆懼僧官民衆痛恨將不利於彼、故爲潛逃也、說者謂彼另有野心、或將爲媚外行動、亦未可知、</p>
<p>（三）西藏善後問題</p>
<p>拉薩當局攝隆霞巴及中委班禪之代表等、於一月二十八日遣派八個專員到中央、敦請中委班禪佛回藏、班禪之回藏、不特僧界官塲歡迎、卽前後藏之民衆、亦無量欣悅、且爲尊崇達賴遺囑、從宗敎信仰方面來說、達賴佛爲觀世音之化身、班禪佛爲阿彌陀之化身、達賴亦卽文成公主之化身、而文成公主乃觀世音化現、所有藏中文化宗敎禮制、自唐以迄民國、皆文成公主愛國愛民愛族之力也、班禪佛乃阿彌陀之化身、而觀世音乃阿彌陀之使者、斯說雖屬宗敎迷信、但記者則不能不從其俗、蓋民衆方面、無不早晚祈禱、散花奉香、敬稱班禪逹賴兩聖僧名號、信仰統一而民族意志亦一、達賴圓寂、全藏民衆悲哀、婦女不穿帶有紅綠色之服裝、對於中委班禪之回藏、全藏民衆、歡騰欣慰、雖在經濟重重壓迫之下、亦不覺得多大痛苦也、</p>
<p>（四）西藏之建設與經濟</p>
<p>西藏建設問題、依照孫總理之實業計劃來講、拉薩到新疆與雲南鐵道計劃在未能完成以前、而談西藏建設、恐成空念、此卽連帶經濟問題、故在中央經濟力量未普及全本部之前、西藏建設之所以緩進、乃係一大原因、藏省臨近强隣、彼强隣恃其交通的便利、與其經濟的穩定、若一有行動、必將受其支配、二十二年以來、英殖民地之經濟勢力、向藏省進攻、日深一日、於是藏省民衆之痛苦、亦日增一日、中委班禪回藏、固爲民衆僧界官方所歡願、已兩電敦促、而達班兩派子弟縉紳舊有的惡感、恐非中央遥爲指示所能調解、必須中央簡派幹練曉暢尰情之大賆來藏鎭攝、或改委員制省、而後可以無患也、此外則爲敎育問題、藏中敎育、敎育與受敎者、均感缺乏、男女社會中、尚係上古風俗、還不及印度今日的中古社會、宗敎爲民衆之鴉片、吾誠信然、若信之過甚、將毒害我子孫萬年、西藏即其例也、多夫制的婦女專制家庭、日夕交歡於佛菩薩像前、彼等不以爲穢濁、而曰男女表定女顯慧、或曰、定慧相印、或曰心性相印、藏省固我同胞也、中央應當一律平等、啓發藏民智識、對於敎育藏省、應設若干小學校、於雲川兩省之大學中、應設藏省免費生、以促進其敎育之發展、因雲川兩省毘連藏康諸區域、來往較爲便利、民性較易接近、或規劃若干山區、誠辦農村、移殖實邊、亦爲必要、總之仍須視中央與地方交通經濟設施普及之力量也、（民國二十三年三月一日自印度國際大學發）</p>

<p>日本不敢向外挑戰</p>
<p>蘇聯急要充實建設</p>
<p>日本與蘇聯的關係、自北滿爲日軍所占領以後、卽漸趨緊張、日本的中堅層幹部、也的確有許多人主張乘勢出擊、把西比利亞打下來再說、但是没有實行、其原因是、（一）東北義勇軍到處蜂起、雖不足以致日軍的死命、但足以牽制他整個的軍事計劃、他最初以爲義軍不過等於土匪、是不値一擊的、結果如他所預料的也有、出乎他意外的也很不少、因此他的侵西比利亞計劃、不能不暫歸停頓、（二）日本國内連續發生事端、一則是軍閥和財閥的衝突、漸見急劇、國内不統一的象徵、已成爲具體的事實、國内旣不統一、又那能對外作戰、日本的軍閥、對這一點知識是有的、所以想先求國内的統一、共産黨的運動、遍及各階級、在貴族學校學習院、都有五六十個人赤化了、在軍隊中有更嚴重的影響、所以日閥在那時候愼重又愼重終於祗限於積極的凖備、</p>
<p>到近來發生兩種極其嚴重的事實、一個是軍事上的、一個是一般政治上的、軍事上的事、是蘇聯飛機常到蘇·鮮邊境和沿烏蘇里江一帶上空、作軍事的考查、最近竟有一架落在密山境内、爲僞軍所獲、日本飛機如飛越國境、或飛近國境時、蘇方軍隊卽開動高射機槍射擊、在政治上蘇聯負責人員、如斯太林·如莫洛托夫·如伏洛希洛夫·等等、一個一個都發表最尖銳最有力的對日演說、</p>
<p>照常理推測、這是日本軍閥所不能忍受的、卽令上層的人、能勉强按著火氣、中堅幹部、也是不肯輕於讓過的、但是到現在、竟不曾發生重大的變故、并且有繼續涵忍的趨向、不過涵忍究竟祗是一時的、有一定限度的、過了這一時期、過了這一定限度、就難保不發生禍亂了、况日本已在積極凖備呢、他已將駐在中東路沿綫的第十師團·和第七四師團、都調回國内、由名古屋第三師團·與京都第十六師團前往塡防、在表面上似乎祗是一種換防、别無何等重大關係、然内中包含着極重大的事實、因爲名古屋第三師團、是日本四個大師團之一、他除了第四騎兵旅團原在中東路綫上以外、尙有兩個步兵旅團、一個野戰重砲兵旅團、這個旅團中有二個野戰重砲兵聯隊、一個野砲聯隊一個高射砲聯隊、三個飛行機聯隊、（共約有飛機三百架、）第十六師團、雖没有第三師團那様大、但也比普通師團多一個飛行機聯隊、和一個重砲兵大隊、由此可以看出日本也正積極凖備、縱然不取攻勢、却也有意應戰、</p>
<p>可是就日本現勢論、還是採取保守的成分多、攻擊的成分少、第一是日本的軍事的整備、據日本專家估計日軍實力與蘇聯軍力、都以爲日軍尙未有充分的把握、因爲日本祗有兩個坦克車聯隊、陸海軍飛機合計一千六百架、民間飛機僅一百五十架、加上軍用副機、最大限也祗有三千架飛機、而蘇聯方面、據日本的探查報告、說是有六千架飛機、還有幾十架超爆擊機、如果日本於開戰後數小時内、不能奪取海參崴飛行塲的話、則東京大阪都有受空襲之虞、其次是所謂日滿經濟聯盟、還没有就緒、在東三省境内的鐵道網、並不曾建築好、重工業也還不能有見諸實用的建設、同時日本在資本主義諸國間的外交關係、亦不曾求得適當的圓滿解决、他顧忌國際間的孤立狀態、能打開了國際的難關、纔有積極挑戰的可能、現在的日本、正從事這些事件、廣田所謂的道義外、其實是含有很濃厚的火藥味道、（一九三四年三月十七於東京）</p>

<p>丨丨其目的爲限制華人丨丨</p>
<p>吧城通訊、荷印總督、於去年九月七日提請國民會議通過荷印入口移民通條例修改及補充案、（卽限制移民案）此新條例定自本年一月一日起施行、去年十月二十四日、全荷印中華商會、曾聯名向荷印總督請願修改此新條例、祖國政府外交部、亦曾指令駐荷金公使提請磋商、現此新條例已實行、修改之望已絕、故自本年起、荷印之人口移民、已有限制、其限制原則如下（一）每年由政府命令規定下列二項、（甲）入口移民之總數、（乙）各種民族每籍入口之數目、（二）上列乙項數目、各民族一律待遇、（三）如在任何一年中、准許入口之移民數低於上列第一條甲項之限度時、（按卽低於入口移民之總數時）則每一民族依照第一條乙項之入口數目、可以增加、其增加數目、至多等於新條例實施前之連續十年中各該籍外僑進入荷荷印總數之十分之一、（四）在任何一年中、一俟第一條甲項所規定之限度已滿時、則僅許移民額數未達限度之各族外僑入口、直至最高依第一條甲項之缺已滿時爲止、（五）丹客檳榔粦加之各區及廖島加里悶屬區之一部、不適用本條例所規定、上列各原則、均由荷印總督帝讓氏提請國民會議通過、其所據理由、照巴城新報譯自政府公報所載、「最近十年中入口外人之數目、雖年有不同、但確有增加傾向、在最近因經濟衰落之故、數字雖稍减、但料在適宜時間、又將冉增、有一九二四年後之情形也、此種入口人數增加之勢、或不能消極停止、在荷印當然尚有可供守法人營居之地、使彼能自立、助荷印繁榮、但土人除農業外、欲立身於工商業、甚爲困難、倘入口移民過多、必將阻碍土人、故必須及時規定外僑進口之限度、以防止將來之移民潮」、於此可見此新條例乃防止將來之移民潮、而保護土人者、此固持之有理、然觀察一九二五年至一九三○年之入口移民統計、而研究此新條例之實質、乃完全爲限制華人之進口也、兹將一九二五年至一九三○年六年間之入口移民統計表鈔錄如左、</p>
<p>移民數　華人移民數　所佔百分比　其他各籍移民數</p>
<p>一九二五年　三二、二七三　二四、二七八　七五％　七、九九五</p>
<p>一九二六年　四五、五六六　三六、四０四　八０％　九、一六二</p>
<p>一九二七年　五０、九六五　三九、八一０　七八％　一一、一四五</p>

<p>一九三０年　四一、九八五　三二、一八一　七八％　九、八０四</p>
<p>本年入口移民總數、政府已規定一萬二千名、（吧城新報十二月十五日發表茂物官署消息、）内分十五組、每組八百人、又據吧城宋總領事於去年十二月十九日與移民廳長會談、廳長解釋、略謂、「此次政府規定一九三四年移民總數爲一萬二千人、事前頗費斟酌、一萬二千人由十五民族分配、每民族八百人、然依照新條例之規定、其仲縮性頗大、蓋每民族滿額時、而其他民族尚未滿額時、得增加至該民族十年來總數之十分之一也、每年華人入口佔最多數、其他民族有僅及八百人、有不及半數者、是以新條例並不足影響華移民、一九三一年華人入口五千餘、一九三三年亦祗五千人左右、並他各籍移民總數、不過三千人左右、現總數爲一萬二千人、則中國移民可佔八千人、」觀此、固差可慰藉、但觀前列統計數字、華人入口每年平均在三萬四千以上、各籍每年平均爲八千四百人、如以十四組平均、每則一民族有六百人、卽以未滿額之二百人、　以十四乘之、加爲華人入口總數亦祇二千八百人、加每族八百人、亦僅三千六百人、所謂八千人者、欺人語耳、兹再鈔錄移民條例之細目於下、俾國人去荷印者、不至爲政府留難也、</p>
<p>（一）新移民條例之新規定　（甲）凡新客之妻子受限制、（乙）執有王字者之妻子不受限制、</p>
<p>（二）通常新客入口時之手續　（甲）准許外僑入境之港口、（爪哇）巴城丹絨不綠海口、三寳壠海口、泗水丹絨北瀝海口、（西利伯）錫江·萬鴉老、（蘇島）勿老灣·沙横·冷沙·火水山·丹絨普拉·雙基厶黨·占卑·巨港·巴東·孟加利海口·錫叨班讓·（婆羅洲）坤甸·山口洋·馬辰·麻里百板·打拉簡、（邦加島）文島·檳港、（勿里洞島）丹絨班蘭、（乙）登坡字之分類、各籍僑民於登陸時、領取登坡字、此種登坡字分兩種、一爲臨時登坡字、期限六個月、（白色）一爲長期登坡字、（黃色）臨時登坡字又名遊歷證、領取臨時登坡字、如於六個月内離境、則所繳進口稅荷幣一百五十盾、可以領回、欲作長期居留者、則須於六個月期限將滿之日、至移民廳更換長期登坡字、如逾期不換、卽作廢紙、再領長期登坡字時、須再繳進口稅荷幣一百五十盾、</p>
<p>（三）長期登坡字之效力　長期登坡字有效期限二年、期滿欲繼續居留者、可請地方長官延長一年、第二次可再請延長一次、期限爲六年、總共期限十年、滿十年可領取王字、卽永久居留字、</p>
<p>（四）擔保移民入境手續　移民入境時、須有親串或雇主擔保、故於輪船靠岸時、由港務司卽行點名過紙、繳納進口稅時、卽報報告擔保者之姓名、商店或機關、於是卽登岸至港口移民事務所、此時擔保人卽可入内擔保、擔保人須親自將其居留字及稅單交移民廳查閱、如擔保人適疾病或因事不能親往、可託一納稅合格之人代領、惟原擔保人須寫一證書及其居留字、稅單交代擔保人交移民廳查閱、查得合格後、當卽貼上相片、發給登坡字、但亦可請其翌日再往移民廳領取者、</p>
<p>（五）擔保人之資格　擔保人資格、以每年所得稅爲標凖、不論職業、規定納稅十五盾者可担保一名、納稅二十盾者担保二名、納稅三十盾者担保三名、納稅四十五盾者担保四名、納稅五十五盾者担保五人、納稅六十五盾者担保六名、納稅七十五盾者可担保七人、餘類推、納稅加多十盾可多担保一人、</p>
<p>（六）入境後之職業問題　移民入境時、移民廳卽將其入境後之職業註明於登坡字、故所謀職業、應與入口時所報告之職業符合、抵岸後、若因特殊情形變更時、須經移民廳批准、不可違背、查出嚴懲、</p>

<p>夏晉麟在國際學會講演</p>
<p>新聲社云、中國國際學會、以近日美日恊調聲浪甚囂塵上、關於遠東問題甚大、於昨日下午四時、在上海聯歡社舉行首次國際講座、請前駐美公使館一等秘書夏晋麟博士演講、「美日恊調聲中遠東和平問題」、到該會會員及各大學學生各報社記者等八十餘人、夏氏詳述英美俄與日之關係及將來趨勢、兹分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c121">破壞和平 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>九一八日佔東北後、破壞國際間之和平有下列三端、一·歐戰以來、各國十餘年所努力之國際聯盟、各會員互保障國際和平、二·自一九零七年至一九一六年日俄平分滿洲之密約、三·一九二二年華府會議保障中國領土及行政完整之九國公約、故國際聯盟各小國、莫不危懼、均一致抨擊日本、惜未能收效、而召集華府會議之美國、亦宣言美國視九國公約與海軍條約爲整個事件、不容分開、</p>
<h3 id="c122">日俄關係 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>至與東北最有密切關係者、首爲蘇聯、日本亦以蘇俄爲攻擊之對象、不惟欲驅逐其出滿洲、且欲驅其出西伯利亞、而於貝加爾湖之東、建立白俄獨立國、前者、日本調華北駐兵往滿洲里一帶、頗將一觸卽發、但以海軍陸軍外交三省意見、未趨一致、而外海兩省、未表同意、故卽和緩、而蘇聯卽提出售中東路之議、以表其對遠東並無野心、希望和平保持西伯利亞之領土、而日本廣田外相之對俄政策、以僞滿建國後、須從事建設者正夥、萬不應輕啓戰募、主分三步進行、一·收買中東路、二·訂日俄不侵犯條約、三·訂俄滿邊疆條約、</p>
<h3 id="c123">英對遠東 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>與遠東關係密切次於蘇俄者、首爲英國、英日間有歷史關係、兩國海陸外各部間、有相互諒解、尤以歐戰時日代英保護遠東利益、故英外長西門在國聯中、時作袒日言論、雖别有原因、亦可見其態度、而一九三二年一月七日、美國史汀生發出不承認通牒、當時美國以爲他國必有表示、詎九日英外部宣言、僅涉領土開放、不侵犯其通商利益、而不談中國領土與行政之完整、至十一日、代表英國政府之倫敦泰晤士報刊一評論、稱許英政府對此不表示意見之適當、謂保障中國領土與行政完整之責、非英國之任務、且中國領土行政、從未有完整之事實云、雖英國民意對華頗表同情、但政府以此爲專門問題、非一般人民所能瞭解也、</p>
<h3 id="c124">美國態度 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>次言美國、以貿易及投資關係言、美國對華遠不如對日之多、然美國歷來態度、對我均甚注意、而深致多無限之希望、但有所舉動時、輒先探英國態度、英國亦然、每致游移不决、而日本卽利用兩國遊移猜測之際、以取得便利、去夏羅斯福召世界經濟會議談話會時、美對我深表同情、但須我能統一自建國策、其時日本外交當局自廣田登臺後、卽調齋藤爲美使、力矯前失、故近日又有恊調聲浪傳出、但據報紙所載談判各節、未必盡然、如滿洲門戶開放、歡迎投資等、本無足異、至移民問題、承認僞滿、許菲律濱獨立、謂美日已在談判中、則决其絕非事實、此外海軍此率問題、卽由五·五·三·比例改爲十一·十一·八、日本决不肯放棄、不過或表示將來會議時可稍讓步、使美國安心、此卽美日關係轉變空氣之所由來、此雖僅係空氣轉變、然在孤立狀態中之日本外交上、已爲無限勝利矣、</p>
<h3 id="c125">將來趨勢 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>在遠東未有鉅大變化之前、英美兩國、决不至承認僞滿、現在遠東均勢旣破壞、英國必須動定其遠東政策、如日本大陸政策續有進展、英國究竟將以武力保障其長江流域原有之勢、抑將放棄之、以吾人所知、在民國十五十六年間、吾國有奪回租界及收回外權之運動、英政府確曾預備放棄、則將來趨勢、是以放棄長江勢力爲較有可能性云、</p>

<h3 id="c181">怎様研究東北問題（六） <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>以上從各組對立概略的討論過了，全問題的總結，即於今日完畢，編者希望讀者能將本篇最後的蛇足，切記在心，其過熟記全文多多矣，敬候批評。　編者</p>
<p>總之，東北問題應作如是觀，並且要在這三組對立交錯中去分析，理解，方能認清它的本質，至於講到我們抗日反帝的肉容是什麽，如何纔能負起這一重大的歷史的使命呢？自然我們應首先清算過去錯誤的觀念，正確認明問題的本質。</p>
<p>編者慚愧之極，祗能提出一點研究的綱領，略止此矣。因爲本欄的篇幅，再不能讓這問題繼續討論下去，淺薄不全之處，在所不免。但是，對於方君，如果在研究東北問題的方法上面能一分的補益，那也就是編者的榮幸了，</p>
<p>然而，編者仍有不能已於言者。方君是東北青年，自然關心東北比其他地方更爲迫切。但是，依據方君的來信，似乎最近方君的救國方略中埋頭研究東北。編者在寫完了這篇短文之餘，也不禁感覺空洞，我想方君讀完此通信後，卽令認編者之言爲然，照様做去，如果祇限於抽象的研究一定也會大失所望的，因此，編者還不能不添一點蛇足，誠摯的以告方君。</p>
<p>中國民族的危機到今日已進到另一新的階段了。東北問題的解决，諸君的榮歸故鄉，在最近的一兩年恐怕都是不可能的事罷！研究東北問題，現在已超過像編者提出的一些話言了。東北問題已有了正確的科學的結論，它已告訴了中國大衆，這是一個整個的民族解放的問題，是反帝反封建和土著資本的整個的民族革命運動的問題，你部分的去研究它而結論也不能不如此，它不能有第二個結論。如果更枝節的去單研究一鱗一爪，那是玩物喪志的行爲，必爲熱血青年所不齒的。爲君之計，鄙意，研究東北問題，應該要爲運用科學的方法，去研究如何組織民衆武力，擴大義勇軍，如何提高抗日反帝的大衆情形，組織民衆；如何去研究遊擊戰爭及一切戰術；如何去佈置反日反帝反奴才的文化戰綫；如何破壞敵人一切物質的精神的建設；如何暴露漢奸，高等華人的醜惡，罪孽，如何去取得全國大衆及世界友軍的聯擊，這一切你都不能在書齋去研究，不能速住在上海的洋樓中去幻想，你得眞的回到「火炕」中去，聯合許多悲歌慷慨的志士，到民衆中去，你應信賴那些「渾渾噩噩的愚民」，祇有他們纔是眞正的反帝的主力，他們中有些現在被漢奸敵人的意識所支配了，你應去克服他們。你不能灰心，不應消極！卽使日人現在如何高壓，民氣如何消沉，我們也應從頭做起，何况現在的事實，並不如你可想像的一般壞呢？方君方君！我寫到這裏也不禁神飛關外了。</p>
<p>最後，希望方君及東北流亡的志士對於我們這次的討論，嚴肅的提出意見與批判給我們，以供我們相互的勉勵，如果諸君能以行動接受以上的建言，則更不枉編者這一番唇舌了。</p>
<p>歷史是人類自己創造的，東北問題的解决，中國民族的解放，一切均在我們自己身上，並且這一解放戰爭結果，必然是我們的勝利。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c182">自殺 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>一個人非到萬不得已的時候，决不肯輕生的，自殺，眞是人生的末路！它心中也不知有怎様的悲痛？最近看到日聯電，它說：「東京，據當局調查，日本自殺者，近來漸有增加之勢，去年東京府自殺者；數共二千五百五十一人，（其中女子一千零五十二人）每日平均有男女七人忙於自殺，比較前年之統計增加一百九十四人，自殺之時期，以春季爲最多，冬季最少，春冬比率爲十對六。自殺原因，悲觀病痛者占最多，失戀痴情關係及和生活困難次之，精神錯亂及家庭不和等又次之，但其大部以經濟關係爲主，自殺者富於感激性之年少人多，抛棄人生前途而選擇死路之二十歳以下青年男女有四百九十八人，二十歳以上三十歳以下者一千一百四十六人。」我們看了它們的統計，反顧我國自殺的人比較它們又怎様様？我每天展閱報章，把春秋看了一遍之後，最留心的是自殺新聞，因爲我極喜研究它們自殺的原因，單是上海一隅，每天至少有三個人以上的自殺，這是最近一月中的統計，其它更有外埠的，和不登新聞紙的鄉鎭上。如果也把它作一個精密的全年統計，較之日本，眞要加上數倍咧！</p>
<p>但是我國人自殺的起因，倒有百分之七十，是爲經濟壓迫，無力維持，不得不用自殺的政策的。尤其是農村破産的現在，自殺的人數比較往年要驟增，我們小小的鎭落上，在這月已有七人因環境惡劣而自殺了！報紙上却没有片紙隻字，像其它的小地方，依此爲比例，把數目報告一下，一定是很驚人的。</p>
<p>現代的青年，把人生觀太看得輕浮了些，我常常腦海裏有到一種感想，「覺人生百年，終於一死。」况且人生又是七十古來稀的。我這種話在家中談起，可是要引起慈母駁斥，不懽。它老人家說：「年紀青青的人，正要和社會做番大事業咧！人生雖然是和朝露一般地短促，可是在這短短的過程中，正應加倍努力的替社會替國家做些大事業，留給後人做個榜様」！的確，一個人不要太頽廢了！還是向着前程努力吧！奮鬥吧！</p>
<h3 id="c183">撲滿 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>童時得了幾個錢，買一個撲滿，積貯起來，等到塞滿了，把他打碎，用繩子貫串起來，或是去換銀元，倘然得到了銀元，那時的快樂，眞是難以形容的了。這些話，說給兒女們聽，都要惹他們的訕笑，以爲所見不廣了。因爲他們現在，幾個銅元都不希罕了，還希罕小錢麽。得了銅元，立刻去消耗，誰耐煩積貯呢。所以撲滿已漸歸淘汰了。我想這東西，並不壞，雖然儘可以不滿卽撲，到底比放在袋裏周折一點。假使能養成習慣，從非滿不撲，到雖滿不撲，日積月累，到了某一時期，一定有一個意想不到的收穫，雖不生息，却在培本。</p>
<p>但是西京雜記載，鄒長倩結公孫私一個撲滿，附一封信去說：「撲滿者，以土爲器以蓄錢，有入竅，無出竅，滿則撲之。土，粗物也；錢，重貸也，入而不出，積而不散，故撲之。土有聚歛而不能散者，將有撲滿之敗，可不試歟？」因此有慳囊之號。這種思想，固然不錯，可是兒童節儉的美德，却和掊克聚歛不同，我們還是認定撲滿是兒童的恩物。</p>
<p>我聯聯想到這個滿字上去了，幸亥革命，可說撲滿已告成功，誰知隔了二十三年，那個撲滿又復活起來，他背後有人撑腰，一時倒不易撲他了。日本貨大都質鬆易壞，這個有日本登錄商標的撲滿，不知道也像一般日本貨麽，這要試騐我們中國人的力量了。</p>

<p>— 彭翔</p>
<p>從報上看到畹滋先生作古的消息，我不禁愴然了。</p>
<p>我前年在民立高三讀書的時候，嚴先生也在那裏當翻譯敎授。雖然祇短短地做了他一年的學生，但他給我的印象是如何的深啊！他是一個學問淵博，態度和靄，詼諧的老人家。老紀不算老，但滿頭盡是白髮，身體碩大得異乎尋常。當時我想：這並不是健康的象徵啊！</p>
<p>嚴先生的喉音是啞很啞的，上課的時候，總用了不少的氣力，大聲的喊，兩邊太陽穴的青筋老是漲得非常的粗。他一面講，手還不停的在黑板上寫；等到一退課，馬褂上盡是白白的鉛粉。</p>
<p>有一天早上，大概他没有吃早飯，退了課，就走到校内的商店裏去買一個五個銅板的麻餅吃。他這種不厭粗糲的節儉習慣，當時是怎様地引起我的尊敬啊！</p>
<p>但在那一年的師生關係中，他從來没有認識過我。現在，他老人家的在天之靈，大概也不會知道有這様一個私心尊敬他的學生，在流着淚哀悼着他吧。</p>

<p>第二十六回　慷慨剖胸襟忘家報國　凄凉對玉鏡嗟我懷人</p>
<p>王士也忘其所以，伸出手來，緊緊的和自强握着，還摇撼了幾下道：趙連長你是個漢子，我佩服着你啦。自强摇着頭道：不想家了，不想家了，軍隊都開出了長城，還想家作什麽？他正嚷着，田青在門外呌道：老趙，嚷什麽？又發牢騷嗎？說着，自那稭秫簾子縫裏，伸進腦袋來。自强笑道：什麽事這様鬼鬼崇崇的。田青側着身子進來，在衣袋裏一掏，掏出一隻玫瑰色的洋紙信封來，對自强幌了兩幌，笑道：寫信，你的自來水筆，借我使使。自强笑道：睡着是黃土坑，吃的是雜合麵，心兒裏的那個黃小姐，你總忘不了。田青道：老道，你屈心不屈心？你成天成夜的咳聲歎氣，直嚷對不起你那新媳婦兒，怎麽我們寫封信就不安分嗎？他說着，在衣袋裏一掏，掏出一大捧大大小小的信封，高高的舉着，笑道：我雖然睡在稭秫堆上，我說是鴨絨褥子，我雖然吃的雜合麫，我說是羊肉包餃子，爲着什麽，有這些個安慰我。趙自强道：田連長，咱們不打哈哈，你存的那分心眼兒，趙早收起來。剛才營長對咱們說什麽來着？不瞞你說，我從卽刻起，下了一百二十分的决心，不想家。於是把剛才同上士王士立說的一番話，再說了一遍。田青先是紅着臉，没有答覆，然後握着自强的手道：趙連長，你說的對，我不再寫情書了。寫也没用，我寫上一千個吻，一萬個吻，誰也没親着誰，倒鬧的心裏半天不是味兒。他兩人在屋子裏說話，外面就有人挿言道：想什麽家？想什麽娘們，没有這些個，我關大個兒，不會鬧到今日這天地。（三四五）</p>
<h3 id="c186">硯的研究（九） <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>端硯概况</p>
<p>乙魚腦凍　美文中有一種生氣團圞如澄潭月漾者，曰魚腦凍，錯落疏散者曰碎凍，硯史說凍者水肪之所凝也。白如晴雲吹之欲散，鬆如團絮觸之欲起者，爲無上品，潔白如冰雪，生動如碎絮者，謂之碎凍，亦佳。且魚腦凍之周圍，必有火捺，或胭脂暈，或金錢捺，或馬尾紋繞之，捺上有青白氣浮起者曰火焰青，此惟大西洞有之，其他色帶黃者爲次，若灰褐色或結實不鬆動者爲下品。</p>
<p>兩　蕉葉白　蕉葉白以如蕉葉初展含露欲滴者爲上，素而潔者爲次，此爲石華的斷語。硯書說：蕉葉白渾成一片，嫩凈如柔股，如凝脂，温而澤，沈而密，注視之深深然隱隱然，如見其裏，惟水巖爲然。廣語說：蕉葉白爲石之嫩處，膏之所成，故其色白，苟其一片純潔微有青花，如秋雲綿密或如水波微塵者必爲端溪之精英。而石隱硯談所說，更爲明白，謂「石性潤則青紫，乾則灰蒼，近今所出梅花巖等石，灰白居多，此乃石之本色，而瞽者以爲蕉葉白誤矣。蕉葉白上下四旁必有火捺掩映，（與上述魚腦凍相同）須知蕉葉白之妙，不必純而成片，須要潤而有神，」則蕉葉白的形態，可想像而得，但蕉葉白之色，究有幾種，則前人曾說過，舊坑之蕉白，純白如魚肉，西洞之蕉白，微紅如帶血羊肝，正洞之蕉白，微紫如初熟葡萄，新坑之蕉白，微黑如着水青磚，日人因此推定爲五種：</p>
<p>（一）純粹無雜略帶青色，如芭蕉初展含露欲滴者，爲最上品；</p>
<p>（二）純白如新鮮魚翅者；</p>
<p>（三）微帶紅色如羊肝者；</p>
<p>（四）微伖紫色如葡萄初熟者；</p>
<p>（五）微帶黑色如着水青磚者。</p>
<p>據上可見其色與名，亦甚複雜，而大者尤爲難得。東京小野鐘山氏，亦係一日本研究端石家，曾說「蕉白非常難得，就余經騐，大者無論矣，卽二三寸小硯而欲墨堂全部蕉葉白者，亦絕紙無之，」則蕉葉白之價値可知矣。</p>
<p>余舊藏一陸儼山老人遺硯，色與葡萄初熟一類相似，而上海丁景祺題爲漢紋蕉葉白，漢紋之名何時昉，前人有無紀述及此，願以質之與無聊有同好者。</p>

<h3 id="c187">卜舫濟的軼話 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>此次卜舫濟七秩華誕，一時同學及賓僚，在約翰大學舉行盛大的祝壽會。極形熱閙，可稱外人在中國創辦學校以來，未曾有過的先例。</p>
<p>卜舫濟，長約翰大學，有五十年的歷史，人都知道，而豈知他從美國到中國，並非就在上海的約翰，他在二十餘歳的時候，先到了吾們的嘉定；嘉定西門外，有一所敎堂，名呌「美國監督會，」這一個名詞，在當時是這様說，大約就是現在的聖公會，不過譯音有此不同罷了；他在會中住了兩年多，平日學習中國的語言文字，頗能上口，所以至今在校中掛着兩句校訓，「學而不思則妄，思而不學則怠，」就是讀中國儒家言的證據，有時遇到孔誕，學生要做紀念的當兒，他還能登壇演講「言忠信行篤敬」一章書，也就是在嘉定打的根柢。</p>
<p>他的夫人，現在是個枯柏夫人，其實枯柏夫人，已經是繼室了；他的元配，並非是西方美人，到是一個上海籍，姓的小姐，名呌「素娥，」這位小姐起先在虹口救主堂讀書，聰慧異常，且善鋼琴，故那時在中國女界上，要算獨一無二的先進了；卜老博士到做禮拜的一天，他從梵王渡必定趕到，參加祈禱，後來，想和黃小姐求婚，但風氣未曾開通，極難達到這美滿的願望，通信多至百數十次，纔得一回復音，居然成了眷屬，這一件事，現在曉得的很少了；以前歐洲大戰，卜老博士有三位令郎，都加入前綫，他的住宅門前，還懸着一面榮譽的戰旗，那旗的角上，繡着三顆明星，就是顯示他三個兒子，都在砲火叢中，作戰殺敵的標幟，實在這三位好男兒，就是上海黃素娥小姐所生；他還有一個女兒，也仍住在美國，守着獨身生活，至今没有字人呢！至黃氏病殁，大約已在中年的時候，卜老博士斷絃後，鰥居將近二十年，始得和校中的女校授枯柏夫人，結續膠的一段佳緣，在中國人的眼光看去，似乎少見，在他們的禮俗，並不希罕，而且還得着敎主的許可哩！</p>
<p>他在校中，主持一切，這人人都知道具有一種毅力，纔能够做到今日的地位，其實他的宗旨，看辦敎育是一方的事業，不以中外爲差别，故數十年中，努力做去，直抱着終身的精神以奔赴，雖然，有時遇到横風怒潮，像飄忽地襲來，他總擺出鎭靜的態度來，一會兒也就平穩無事的過去了；他視學生，寛乎中寓着嚴敬，上課時候，儻在上半天，他有時還來看看，學生們聽得遠遠裏，橐！橐！的革履聲，大家明白是「卜老頭子」來了，（學生呌他的渾名，）就是一般敎師們，也要有些戒謹，這實在是他的不可及處。</p>
<p>還有幾回笑話，卜老，博士，在吾們嘉定的時候，美國監督會的裏，有一淮南所創的豆肆，他初次看了這潔白的腐塊，驚爲奇珍，待嘗其味，詫爲滋養唯一的食品，每飯不忘，後來，又見他的製法，就害怕不敢入口了；這笑話，至今還有二個豆腐老闆，尙能記憶着，以爲卜老博士在嘉定的一樁紀念！約翰當中歷史上最老的，要算現在顔惠慶大使的父親，顔擁金先生了，就是校中思顔堂的意義。這時候，卜老，博士，自然居在小輩之列，有一次新年裏，他依應吾們中國風俗，頭戴紅緯大帽，脚登玄色長統靴，到顔家去拜年，雖被人家說笑，到也不算什麽事。在校内管理學生，儻不聽他的話，犯了規則，唉！竟有時會得用扑擊掌心來訓戒，現在桃李中，想曾受着他夏楚風味的，也不乏其人咧！</p>

<p>比較最有精彩之一幕、厥爲申園法商與西捕之戰、法商固已榮膺本屆甲組冠軍、昨戰勝負雖不影響覇權、但西捕以奪得史高塔杯之雄威、加以先前曾擊敗法商、是戰之劇烈可知、開賽後西捕鋒芒殊盛、逼攻法商其勢甚兇、但屢攻不進、並復失去十二碼球機會、霉頭一觸、被法商連中四球、但下半時中、西捕亦攻入法商四球、惜再負一十二碼球、結果法商遂以五比四勝、</p>
<p>棒球塲東華對西商之戰、咸以爲東華必勝無疑、安知東華未能照其所發表之陣綫出塲、重要角色如戴麟經萬象華等、均作座上客、考其原因、聞因球員中略有意見、致以零比一爲平庸之西商所敗、然李義臣要不失去十二碼球當成一比一之和局、東華何其不幸也、球迷遂大起責難、茲將最近甲組現勢錄下、</p>

<p>優游乙組昨與猶太作幼級盃决賽於逸園、觀衆雖祇數百、然呐喊助威、頗不寂寞、優游先曾二對○絕對之優勢、但以後因氣力不佳、連續被猶太攻進二球、成平和局面、延長三十分、雙方俱因人馬困頓、各無所獲、一百二十分鐘完畢、由裁判宣布改期再見高低、</p>

<p>優游開球、先取攻勢、猶太駐重兵於二關防守、往來久之、難開紀錄之門、沈柏貴領兵進犯、得勢射門、但不幸稍偏一尺、猶太數數反攻、俱以楊銘金手脚溜滑、而不能如願、外而久之、沈柏貴南郊放馬、闖至低綫、一脚傳中、胡有成從天而降、近在咫尺、狄思威心慌滑倒被胡一撥入門、華籍看客、莫不欣然色喜、開球再戰、優游前鋒愈見活躍、小孟嘗程貽澤得球邁進遇阻、卽傳與張長江、張對門送去、小沈及時趕到砰然一脚、却又應聲入網、成二對○絕對之優勢、</p>

<p>上半時法商凈勝四球</p>
<p>西捕反攻惜負十二碼</p>
<p>球塲雖滑、然兩隊表演、仍甚精彩、法商守門改以雷蒙特、救出險球不少、中衛有金湯之固、後衛亦差强人意、前鋒鮑沙脫調小華特任左翼、得力甚大、惜長力不濟、下午時頗露倦容、故少建樹矣、西捕因十二碼球失去、被法商連、中四球、下半時西捕捕猛攻不已、並調透納任前鋒、衝勢愈足、並賴活根生之强硬脚頭、美麗之射擊、得亦還敬四球、惜其中又負十二碼球、乃以四比五惜敗、兩隊勝球均得力於左翼、形勢之變化、則隨風勢而殊、</p>
<h3 id="c194">西捕猛攻一再失機 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>西捕開球後、猛攻不已法商處處受敵、岌岌可危、傑勃生刦柯萊脫脚上之球、送與活根生、活逼近門邊、德飛射門、球彈横木而仍落門下、守門爲之一荒、欲出搶球、而德飛已趕到再射、臬谷洪夫卽柯充守門、千鈞一髮之際、德飛射成野球、活根生再度發兵、法商門前呈混亂之狀、臬谷洛夫乎觸球被罰十二碼、後右内衛齋脫主踢、爲法商守門雷蒙特撲出界外、活根生角球妙送、卒未得利、西捕如此雄威、未得建功、大觸霉頭、往後竟連失四球之多、大爲喪氣、</p>

<p>西捕旣觸霉頭、法商則如喜從天降、宛如暴雨之後、重覩天日、精神爲之大振、氣焰不可一世、前鋒如「挿翅虎」欲「撲天鴨」左翼鮑沙脫一遞一送、使西捕門前無頃刻之安、傑蘇首開紀錄、鮑沙脫頭頂建功、守門接而滑入、柯萊脫得法凡怯之球、盤前、將至門下、蕭脫阻柯之射擊、欲使守門奔門救球、不意沙脫捷足先登、射中空門、往來柯萊脫單騎刧營、透納隨後追趕不及、西捕遂負四球、</p>
<h3 id="c196">喧賓奪主球勢一變 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>休息之後、西捕得順風之便、喧賓奪主、形勢爲之一變、宛如上半時之法商、威列先試脚頭、球彈横木而越左、赫雷再射、馬山兒救出、傑克亦射被救、德飛再攻、守門抱球跌地、馬山兒立阻德飛之衝、守門遂得起身救出、活根生、久靜思動、横掃側擊、首建奇功、於是聲勢大振、進攻愈烈、法商招架不遑、谷史坦雷米狄恊力保守、馬不停蹄、活動生送、出角球、正沿球門、横木落下、守門躍起撈空、球竟落入門之右角、西捕遂得以還敬兩球、而成四與二之比、</p>

<p>西捕當此方興未艾之際、不意竟失一十二碼球、良以法商交鋒偶而深入、傑勃生慌張犯規、雷米狄一踢中鵠、法商乃以五比二佔優、然西捕往後又獲兩球、要不失此十二碼球、當成四四和局、故勝負之分、實繫於此、時西捕調笨透伯納任前鋒、横衝直撞、法商大窘、活根生百步穿楊、三十碼外料射、球飛躐入門、殊爲美觀、不二分鐘、德飛得活根生之傳球、在門前三四碼處踢進、尚餘五分鐘時、惠士伍在對方罰球區邊踢任意球未中、結果法商乃以五比四勝、裁判海爾、懦弱非凡、備受觀者譏嘲、</p>

<p>東華逆風進攻、阻於中衛綫、往返數分鐘、東華第一道防綫、忽現漏洞、西商乘隙直入、馮念漢出脚不愼、球自跨下滾進、陸鐘恩遠離龍門、茂雷見機卽攻、一聲笛起、宣告陷落、其時西商環攻龍門、爲勢兇惡、幸而一致抵抗、保持患局、</p>

<p>主席報告　主席潘公展報告略謂、今天是中國文化建設恊會舉行成立大會、我們發起此會之意義、因目前大家感覺到中華民族已至生死存亡之關鍵、要想救國家救民族一定要從根本上努力、要根本努力則不能不從文化上用功夫、但在這世界劇烈競爭之今日、各國俱擴充軍備、崇尙武力、以求生存、而我們在此講文化、或許引起一部份人之誤會、殊不知要使民族發生力量、必行具備發生民族力量之條件、談起此條件、卽不能忽略了文化、文化是一般人生活的方式、是無所不包無所不用的、無論任何民族國家、其生活方式之表現卽文化、社會的進化、亦卽文化的進化、而其進化的表現、卽在生活方式之進步、從古代社會人民由漁犰畜牧而農業工業商業、其生活方式之進步、卽表現文化之進步、故文化之範圍頗廣、不僅是書本上的東西、亦非書獃子所專用的東西、我們要救國、要使民族增加力量、卽要從文化上努力、中國到現在大家都覺得不滿意、但反觀我國之有數千年歷史、足證我們民族亦有寳貴之精神存在、本會之發起、卽集合全國意志相同的人、一方復興我國固有的文化而發揚光大之、一方吸收人家可取的文化、補充我們之不足、以建設適合現代的文化、來謀中華民族之復興云、</p>
<p>黨部致詞　市黨部代表童行白致詞略謂、自九一八一二八以後、許多有民族意識的份子、大家呼號奔走、以謀救國、如航空救國、敎育救國、建設救國、國貨救國等等、但這些都是偏於一方面的、而國家之興衰、决非由一方面造成、係集合各方面之總和所致、故救國方法亦當融會起來、才能有效、這種包括各方面的方法卽文化、中國處於今日之危險境地、實由於文化之低落、故要救國、非從文化上努力不可、文化包括精神與物質兩方面、中國文化建設恊會成立後、卽要負責從精神與物質兩方面謀文化之建設云</p>
<p>市長致詞　吳市長致詞略謂、兄弟在前年乘飛機從北平至南京、從南京至杭州、曾在飛機上觀察中國的農村、看到許多很久的設備、證明我們祖宗之智識雖不如今人之多、但其創造力是很偉大的、因此中國才有數千年之歷史、在今日是危急存亡之秋、尙不致完全没法、但今日我們國民旣不能發揚固有的、同時又不能截人之長以補已之短、一味的妄自誇大、或妄自非薄、彷彿岐途、創造力一天天失掉、致造成今日之局面、故中國文化如再不謀復興、與各國迎頭幹上去、則文化愈低落、民族滅亡可立而待、希望中國文化建設恊會成立後、號召全國一致努努力來發揚中國舊有文化、吸收外國文化創造復興中國的新文化云、</p>
<p>中國文化建設協會成立之影（啓昌攝）</p>

<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>我國舊醫學之議論。其凌座淆亂。未有如傷寒之甚者也。傷寒之名。起於内難。至仲景而始著。以其著傷寒論也。至叔和而始昌。以其撰次仲景遺論也。内經之言傷寒也曰。夫熱病者。皆傷寒之類也。反而言之。傷寒亦熱病之類矣。難經之言傷寒也曰。傷寒有五。有中風。有傷寒。有濕温。有熱病。有温病。是則傷寒爲熱病之類之總名。又可爲熱病類中之一專名也。而仲景傷寒論中。有曰。太陽病發熱。汗出惡風。脈綏者。名有中風。有曰。太陽病。或已發熱。或未發熱。必惡寒。體痛嘔逆。脈隂陽俱緊者。名曰傷寒。有曰。太陽病。發熱而渴。不惡者。爲温病。有曰。若發汗已。身灼熱者。名曰風温。則是伸景之所謂傷寒論。乃痛論中風，傷寒，温病等熱性病之書。與内經難經同旨。非僅言脈隂陽俱緊之傷寒也明矣。千金方引小品，有曰。傷寒。雅士之辭。云天行温疫。是田舍間號耳。時後方曰。貴勝雅言。總呼傷寒。世俗因號爲時行。外臺秘要引許仁則論大行病云。此病方家呼爲傷寒。姚公集騐。傷寒時氣温疫同毒。孫眞人千金方傷寒門。多言天行疫氣。辟温殺鬼。張文仲傷寒温病同治。古今錄騐以陰陽爲傷寒所成。由此觀之。仲景叔和以後。亦以傷寒爲時氣熱病。有傳染之性者矣。前乎仲景叔和之時之人之書。多以傷塞爲時氣熱病。後乎仲景叔和之時之人之書。亦多以傷寒爲時氣熱病。仲景叔和之目傷寒。乃如後世庸妄之輩。囂囂然以爲北方之病。冬月之病。病寒直中之病乎。是故傷寒論者。時氣疫病論也。今之傳染病論也。</p>
<p>雖然，隂陽大論以下。謂傷寒非時行之氣者頗多。隂陽大論之言曰。「冬時嚴寒。萬類深藏。君子固密。則不傷於寒。觸冒之者。乃名傷寒耳。…………中而卽病者。名曰傷寒。不卽病者。寒毒藏於肌膚。至春變爲温病。至夏變爲暑病。暑病者熱極。重於温也。是以辛苦之人。春夏多温熱病。皆由冬時觸寒所致。非時行之氣也。凡時行者。春時應暖而復大寒。夏時應大熱而反大凉。秋時應凉而反大熱。冬時應寒而反大温。此非其時而有其氣。是以一歳之中。長幼之病。多相似者。此則時行之氣也。」</p>
<p>自陰陽大論之後。歷代醫家。宗其說以分傷寒温熱之治者。成爲風氣矣。千金方引小品云。「論治者。不判傷寒與時行温疫爲異氣耳。云傷寒。是雅士之辭。天行温疫。是田舍聞號耳。不說病之異同也。考之衆經。其實殊矣。所宜不同。方說宜辨。」是亦以傷寒温疫爲不同也。巢氏病源候論卷十温病發斑候曰。夫人冬月觸目寒毒者。至春始發病。病初在表或已發汗吐下。而表證未罷。毒氣不散。故發斑瘡。又冬月天時温暖。人感乖候之氣未卽發病。至春又被積寒所折。毒氣不得泄。至夏遇熱。其春寒解。冬温毒始發出於肌膚。斑爛隱　。如錦文也。」小品「葛根橘皮湯。療冬温未卽病。至春被積寒所折。不得發。至夏得熱。其春寒解。冬温毒始發出肌中。斑爛隱疹如錦文。」古今錄騐黃連橘皮湯。漏蘆橘皮湯。說與小品葛根橘皮湯同。此皆伏氣爲病之說也。孫眞人千金方。舉時行温疫。屬之傷寒門中。外臺秘要析而三之。一變千金之主張。是明明以爲傷寒温病，天行，三者不同。然未能疆界明劃也。綜其大要。古人論寒熱温凉炎爲病。可分爲三類。</p>
<p>第（一）本氣爲病。所謂冬時嚴寒。觸冒之者。名傷寒也。然詳其言。似四時本氣。皆足致病。但不甚耳。故除陽大論又曰。「其傷於四時之氣。皆能爲病。以傷寒爲毒者。以其最成殺厲之氣也。」此言春傷於温。夏傷於暑。秋傷於凉。皆能致病。但不如冬傷於寒之厲耳。第（二）歳時不和。温凉失節。中非時之进熱温凉者。謂之時行。亦謂之天行。又謂之温疫。故傷寒例曰「其冬有非節之暖者。名曰冬温。」又曰，「從春分以後至秋分節前。天有暴寒者。皆爲時行寒疫。」病源又名時行寒疫爲時行傷寒。此皆謂傷於非時乖候之寒熱温凉而爲病者也。所謂時行之氣也。</p>
<p>第（三）中而不卽發。仲於體中。乘間而起者。卽後世之所謂「伏氣」爲病也。素問生氣通天論所云。「春傷於風。邪氣留連。乃爲洞泄。夏傷於暑。秋爲　瘧。秋傷於溼。上逆而欬。發爲痿厥。冬傷於寒。春必病温。」此言伏氣爲病之始也。上文所述病源候論温病發斑候所云。冬月觸冒寒毒云云。及冬月天時温暖。人感乖候之氣云云。亦言伏氣爲病也。然素問春傷於風云云。及病源冬月觸冒寒毒云云。乃指傷於四時本氣爲病而不卽發者爲言。若病源之冬月天時温暖。人感乖之氣云云。則指傷於四時疫氣爲病而不卽發者爲言也。則是古人之於時行温疫。亦有中而不卽發伏氣爲病之說矣。</p>
<p>由此觀之。傷寒有中而卽發與中而不卽發之異。温熱亦有中而卽發與中而不卽熱之異。時行亦有中而卽發中而不卽發之異。三者之别。古人無良法也。唯於時行之氣。有顯然之表示。曰，非其時而有其氣也。曰，一歳之中。長幼之病。多相似也。如是而已矣。</p>
<h3 id="c211">談肺癆 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 張致果</p>
<p>（一）肺癆之生成</p>
<p>肺癆的原因在新醫學上大家知道是一種結核菌作祟。在吾國的舊醫學上說是因勞傷積弱所致。所以有産後癆房癆等名稱。其實單是結核菌侵入吾人體内。未必卽成肺癆。而單因勞傷積弱。亦不致患肺癆。必兩者兼併。乃生肺癆。故肺癆之生成有二種條件。一曰外因。一曰身體的適應狀態。（Disposition）外因者。卽結核菌之侵入體内。所謂身體的適應狀態者。卽抵抗力之程度也。夫結核菌在市廛囂雜之處。彌温於吾人之四周。他有頗强的抵抗性。由病人痰吐中出來之結核菌。可歷久不死。飛揚於塵埃之中。隨時隨地可侵入吾人體内。不必與肺癆病者接近之際。始被染着。吾人每日中或有一二個結核菌侵入呼吸器内。然未必致病。蓋健康的身體具有抵抗力。能消滅侵入之病菌。卽或侵入之病菌在肺内作崇。亦不過發生微小部分之局部病變。隨卽愈好。並不發生任何症象。亦不致蔓延成患。而吾人對於此暫時的病變。茫然無知。就是經醫生用最精密的診斷方法亦不能證明。以上所說的。讀者容或不信。但是有確實的證據。就是據屍體解剖的統計。每百人中至有九十六七人之肺中，必有患過局部的肺結核之痕跡。可知吾人在生活過程中，必有一二次，或許多次受着肺結核菌的侵襲。而發生局部的病變於肺葉中。但隨卽自愈。而不致釀成肺癆。若身體之抵抗力，一旦因生活上之種種不良影響，如操勞過度，起居不適，或患其他疾病，致偶然减弱。則侵入之結核菌卽可乘機猖獗。乃成肺癆。舊醫所謂生産，房事過度等亦是减弱身體抵抗力之原因。乃肺癆之誘因而已。</p>
<p>身體之適應狀態亦由二種條件所成。其一。爲先天性的。（Donstitution）卽俗稱爲體質。在新醫學上有肺癆質之名稱。蓋謂身體之構造上容易感受肺癆。其二，爲後天性的。（Condition）卽由生活狀况所釀成者。夫體質因人而異。而生活狀况亦人各不同。故身體之適應狀態人人各異。不但伂癆質與非肺癆質之别而已。卽同是患肺癆者。因其適應狀態之不同。故症候及經過亦異。有患數月而亡。有罹病十餘年而猶存者。在臨床上，則有急性，慢性，增殖性，滲液性，開放性，閉鎖性等。形形式式。名稱繁多。所以然者。非侵入之結核菌有異也。蓋病者之抵抗力程度不同。或不敵病菌之戕賊。任其猖獗。病變之演進急驟。至數月而亡。或能與病菌繼續掙扎。歷十載而猶存。讀者明白以上所述。可知能注意日常衛生。於質薄弱之人，猶須鍜鍊身體。使日致强健。卽所以預防肺癆。而於已患肺癆之人。在肺癆特効療法尙未發明之時。僅以强健身體，增進抵抗力爲防杜病候進步之唯一方法。</p>
<p>（二）肺癆之經過</p>
<p>肺癆之經過及症候最無一定。本來無論何種疾病。其經過及症候均因人而異。並無一定可規之型式。在書本上所叙述者，不過講其大概而已。故内科大師克來而氏（Krehl）在其病理學序文内曰。「祇有患病之人而無所謂疾病」。乃確論也。</p>
<p>雖然，於其他急性傳染病大都有可以規定之經過及症候。而獨放肺癆一病，由輕而重，至於瀕死。毫無一定步驟。試擇數個患肺癆者比較之。則其經過及症候，以及肺内之病變互不相同。推其故，有二。其一；因身體之適應狀態不但人人各異。且同一患者之適應狀態隨時而異。或因生活狀况之變易。或因其他疾病之感染。或因生理上之變化。（如患肺癆者因妊娠而加劇。）致身體之抵抗力有時增强。有時减弱。使體内之結核菌有時猖獗。有時靜伏。其二：因結核菌之侵襲可隨時隨地。例如已染肺癆之人漸臻愈好。而忽又有多量結核菌侵入肺内。致病又加劇。故患肺癆者之肺中，其病變之型式異常複雜。有潰腐者。有已結疤者。有方在起始發炎者。各自演進而互相並存。在臨床上雖分增殖性，滲液性，或乾酪空洞等各種型式。實則多數肺癆患者之肺中，各刑俱備。除初起者外，必無清一色者也。</p>
<p>讀者如已明白以上所述。再談到肺癆之三期。凡病由輕而重以至瀕死。漸次演進。本無界限可言。在幾種比較有規則的急性傳染病：若痧子，眞性肺炎等。或以發疹熱退等經過。或以解剖上的變化。（如眞性肺炎）尙可勉强分爲數期。至於肺癆之經過及症候。旣毫無一定。而肺内之病變又各型俱備。何能分期。若以病勢言。例如：瀕死者爲三期。初起者爲第一期。則更漫無界限標凖。然今人談及肺癆。必曰幾期。病家懼三期之將臨。如被判死刑。而醫者亦侈言三期。以誇其診治之神妙。若就而細詢之：何謂三期。恐瞠目不能對者甚多。余非欲詆毁他人。蓋醫德日喪。兹竟有以專治第三期肺癆號召者。卽就此專治第三期一語觀之。足見其對於病理毫無知識。而妄自誇爲專家。其所稱爲三期者。必以病勢言也。對踵門求治者儘可指爲第一二期。對瀕死者儘可指爲第三期。亦有模棱其辭。對病者曰：汝病介乎一二期或二三期之間。儼然瞭病若指掌。是眞不値識者之笑也。</p>
<p>然則肺癆有三期乎。曰有之。始於專門研究肺癆之賴甘氏（Banke）。余於此，不得不伸明：以前醫界中亦有以病變程度及範圍分爲三期者。然病變之刑式，如余所述，恒各型俱備。而至於病變之範圍，更不能表示肺癆之演進程度。故無標凖。而爲衆否認。依賴甘氏之研究。患肺癆者有一種特異情形。卽於初染病之時，不發生若何反應。故初起者，病者不自知。醫者不能察。若病變蔓延進步之後。則病體起一種特强反應。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>卽對於一種結核菌之毒質起劇烈之反應現象。此種反應現象實卽抵抗力之表現。賴甘氏稱此時爲反應過敏期。（Allegisches　Stadium）或曰第二期。故初起未有反應時，稱爲第一期。若病變蔓延更甚。體内之結核菌異常猖獗。則身體之抵抗力日益衰殆。至不能抵敵。故反應現象反又消滅。此時稱爲第三期。至於反應之强弱有無。在症候上以發熱爲標凖。在病變上以細胞增殖爲標凖。而最可鑒定之者。則爲結核菌毒素接種之方法。在第二期内，以結核菌毒素接種於皮膚。則接種之處起劇烈發炎。而接種之法爲皮下注射恒起發熱等現象。若於第一期行之。則此種反應較弱。或無之。在第三期行之。則無反應。就臨床上言之。則患者在第一期時恒無若何症象。至多疲弱而已。此時病者不但不知。卽醫師亦無從診斷。蓋肺内之病變亦甚微。雖用Ｘ光或亦不能顯形也。在第二期時則有潮熱等症象。若病變蔓延甚速。則發熱甚高。患者可於第二期内因反應現象過分劇烈而死。在第三期時則無發熱。而身體恒異常衰弱消瘦。而致於死。就各期之經過言。則無一定。在第一期内愈好者甚多。卽屍體解剖之統計中外觀上未患肺癆之人也。不幸而入第二期後。或漸趨愈好。或不幸卽死。或歷十餘年二十餘年永久在第二期内。唯一旦因身體之抵抗力因他種原因而忽然减弱。則轉入第三期。若轉入第三期内後。則死亡之期必近。然亦有因調養得宜。抵抗力復增而能維持甚久者。（按第三期之反應消失。亦因免疫性增進之故。因辭費而一般讀者不易了解。故不及。）總之。肺癆之分三期以反應爲標凖。而瀕死者未必爲第三期之患者。在第二期中死者甚多。而長久生存於第三期中者亦有之。至於第二期之久暫及死亡之遲速。全在於患者之適應狀態也</p>
<h3 id="c212">書上海市醫師公會診金規定草案後（續） <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>我近來所診的一個病人就是一個好例。這病人所患的係副睪丸炎症（淋性），在我去診時，已臥床二個半月了！我們曉得，副睪丸炎一症，除根本原因療法外，其自覺症象之解除，所需時日並不很多。卽萬一不當，弄到局部化膿，結果卽使用切開手續，所需時日也未見很長。决不至臥床二三月的。假使這病人今後緩緩痊愈了，那過去二月的光隂和金錢，不是完全虛擲了嗎！第三無論病勢嚴重與否，以多延醫爲唯一上策。這是我們有錢人家擺闊的格局，但不幸中流階級方面，有此惡習的也不少。我記得早年有一個病家小孩患感冒；早晨延一位醫師，代他注射owandin一次，到了三四時後，病家見温度較昇，隨卽另延他醫師，這位同道也和病家說不要緊的。到下午又來找我了，我診他有氣管枝炎，怕他因此而患氣管枝肺炎，同時又因病家之要求，代他注射一針Transpumino到了夜間又另延他醫。結果一到明天，温度完全下降。試想以一無關得失的輕症，而結果化去四倍以上之診金；怎能不大呌醫藥費之難擔負呢！幸而這幾位都是正式醫師，措詞都非常正當的；我想假使來一位用一點平常所謂的醫術，那小孩病痊愈，當然完全是他的大力；我們前面幾人，少不得病家要駡幾聲飯桶的。病家的惡習慣，我想實際上定不止此；但能將此三種認清加以矯正，我想所省的醫藥負擔費定不在少的</p>
<p>末後我對於這份草案，還要補充一點。第一我所認識的同道和我個人的診例，都列有常年健康顧問一條。大概個人每年百元，小家庭二三百元，大家庭四五百元。這除手術費藥費外，一切常診費都包括在内的。這一件事，我覺對於中流階級是非常有利益的。一般量入爲出，有全部計畫的病家，至少可預算着每年須負擔醫費的正確數目；卽使有大病發生，也不致一次費鉅額金錢，有背原來預算。至對於月入祇五十元至百元的人們，不妨視其生活狀態情形，而稍减低價格。（個人可减至五十元，小家庭百元。）對於病家費之擔負，我想所補也匪淺鮮的。</p>
<p>第二普通病家在患病的時候，大多數都不願留住醫院。這是我個人一種特殊性格，可諱言的。但這様一來，醫師更加倍苦痛了！除大手術無辦法外，普通的小手術或中等手術，病家最好也願意在家裏。所以有時醫師的器械和行使手術的大小種種用具，每每拿到病人家裏去的。像這様情形，主治醫師當然須加倍吃力，結果也許反不見好的。舉個尋常的例，靜脈注射，是盡人可能的；但病人家裏，有時因光綫和臥床不適宜的原因，也感覺困難的；其他的手術更可推想了！再則病人在家裏，醫師大都不能完全行使職權的。譬如你代病人行切開手術後，同時病家服另外你所不許可的方劑，你當然阻止不了這許多的。結果要使病人壞了，那責任是要行使手術的人擔負的。所以我主張：凡種種中小手術，以醫院行使爲宜，而病家堅决要求在家行使者，須按原價加倍或三倍取費。這二條我個人覺得可以補充在草案裏面的，不知新醫諸同道讀了怎様。（完）</p>

<p>— 瞿紹衡</p>
<p>走馬疳是舊醫的名稱。新醫呌作壞疽性口内炎。Stomatitis　Gangraenosa又名水癌。Wasserkrebs,Noma這個病症不管是新醫舊醫。都認爲是一種凶險的毛病。聽見了磊家要皺眉摇頭的。鄙人第七個男兒。在肺災方始脫險的時候。又加以本病的侵襲。像風燭一般的弱兒。怎抵得了這惡病的摧殘。不過兩天的工夫。就把一條小命結果了。我不知道爲什麽造造要生出這種殘酷的病種。同時也替我們醫界抱没有辦法的遺恨。因此感想到療法的重要。所以把我所知道的方法。先來披露一下。希望同志們指敎。這病的原因。到如今還没有弄明白。有人說是一種螺旋狀菌Spiroheta又有人說是一種變形蟲。Amoeba總之身體虛弱營養不良的小兒。最容易得這一種毛病。是大家公認的事實。據祁兒開Gierke說有兩種誘因。貧苦，營養不良，不潔等爲外因。麻疹猩紅熱，百日咳，痘瘡，間歇熱，肺炎，赤痢，結核構毒等傳染病和英吉利病，（Ｒachits）出血性素質等全身病爲内因。其中發在麻疹後的比較的最多。</p>
<p>這病的症狀。外觀上是頰壞疽。先從頰的内面。口角附近。發生水泡變成潰瘍。腐自衝鼻。是後來就很快的蔓延到口腔全面和染部。要不了幾天的工夫。潰瘍會把頰部皮肉穿貫。而且把露出的骨質也要同様的壞死。患側的顔面浮腫。附近的淋巴線賬。局部略有疼痛。口内分泌增多。混有膿血。熱度高低不定。厲害的可達四十度以上。體力的消耗。有疾風似的迅速。所在往往突然虛脫。說到死亡數的統計。在醫學精明的外國也要死到四分之三。</p>
<p>這病的療法。最要緊是維持體力。增加營養。防止蔓延。然而因爲來的太快。往往措手不及。我把一般的療法。披露在下面。也許可以供醫家和病家的參考。而誌我的悲懷。</p>
<p>（一）全身營養　這祢能够作爲一種預防的方法。等到已經病了。那就急來抱佛脚來不及啦。關於增進營養的藥品，我愛用的是「老補藥」（Ｒ）obural「維剛妥」Ｖigantol「合力護僂」（Haliverol）「臘育來克斯」（Ｒayolex）「賴克屈隆」（Lextron）等。最好居常多用些牛奶。上海羊奶公司的羊奶實在比牛奶還要合理。</p>
<p>對於已病的病人。用乙種維他命靜脈或者皮下注射。輸血要是小兒可用他父母的血液來臀筋注射。其方法先將百份之五的滅菌枸椽酸鈉溶液五Ｃ.Ｃ.吸入注射器内。再取血液五十西西注入臀筋。至於血量的多少。注射的間隔。當然依患兒的年齡。病勢的輕重。而由醫師隨時酌定。</p>
<p>對於口腔内的消毒。可以用百分之五的雙養水二○○丨三○○倍的舁汞水三○○丨五○○倍雷佛奴耳溶液一千倍的灰錳養溶液漱口或者拭擦。</p>
<p>對於腐爛的局部。用銀六○六粉末或者百分之五丨一○的甘油塗布。硝酸銀腐蝕或者燒灼器燒灼。或才用銳匙搔爬。據有年紀的老人說。桐油的塗擦和含嗽。差不多有百發百中的效果。現在煤油治肺病的療法。已經引起了醫界的注意。桐油本來是防腐的東西。也許有殺蘇的可能。希望同志加一些注意。</p>
<h3 id="c214">肺病用煤油治愈之實騐（三續） <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>謹按本文爲日本試用煤油諸家之實騐報告，錄之藉供我國關心諸士參考之用，至於眞正成績若何，則正在研究蒐集材料中，不能草草卽行報告也。</p>
<p>（三）煤油用作治療肺病藥較無論何藥皆有效果</p>
<p>神戶川崎造船廠醫務室醫學士木村佐太雄（談話）</p>
<p>藥學博士下山順一郎氏所著之製藥化學下卷五頁載有「歐洲民間用煤油作慢性腸加答兒之藥」又本草綱目之石部載有時珍曰，煤油氣味與雄黃硫黃相同，故殺蟲治瘡，共性走竄，故放入諸器物，皆可滲透，祗貯於瓷器及玻璃不漏。錢乙於治小兒之驚熱，膈實，嘔吐，痰涎之銀液丸中用之，又以和水銀，輕粉，龍腦，蝎尾，白附子諸藥爲丸；蓋不僅用此物化痰之力，並利用其善能通經絡走關竅之點云云，認其有化痰之力，並欲利用其滲透性，可稱極有卓見</p>
<p>可見煤油之供藥用，自古時已有之，並非稀奇之事，惟認爲對於肺結核具有特效，則不能不謂爲新發見。</p>
<p>我與川崎造船廠醫局之松尾等氏，對於工人中之多數肺病患者，勸其試服煤油，五六十人中，有半數以上以服煤油而於短期間全治，尚有半數，因係相當重症，故未有顯著成績。此並非作爲醫藥給與，祗係有人願服則與之，不取油値，聽其自動試服，因此其中有人竟濫將煤油一合，作二次飲下，致苦咳嗽。其能注意分量飲下者，大都首爲精神爽快，次卽自翌晚不見盜汗，經二三日，必覺食慾增進，此三者皆爲飲煤油時所同得之經騐，以前之藥物，從未見有如此顯著之效果者。</p>
<p>我雖不能斷言煤油對於任何肺病，皆可治愈，但較從前之無論何藥，更有效果，則爲我所深信而不疑者。</p>
<p>（四）五十幾個人中除一人外其他皆有效果</p>
<p>神戶市林田區二葉町八醫學士木下政市</p>
<p>我現在正作種種動物試騐，其成績容當於醫學會發表。將煤油注射於動物（鼠）之腹腔内，未及三十分間，動物之全身之毛已有油氣，發煤油臭。對於人亦有同様情狀。對於其致死量，人飲至三百瓦，尚可不死。</p>
<p>對於煤油之種類。我曾就八種檢查，已知用「上松」牌煤油，不知用較次之煤油爲安全。</p>
<p>關於臨床例，雖不過五十幾例，其中除一合併有肋膜炎及肺結核第三期之重症者一例，結果不良外，其他皆效果極佳，速者祇飲二次，遲者祗飲十五次，病即全治。</p>
<p>所飲分量，視年齡及症狀自七八瓦至二十瓦斟酌增减飲之。隔五日或一星期乃飲一次，飲此時刻，宜在晚餐三四小時後，亦不必廢去晚餐，如覺難飲，可加薄荷油一二滴飲之。</p>
<p>使我驚嘆之例，爲一年三十歳之女人，自發病以來，恰歷一年，係兩肺患有結核並進展至喉頭之重症患者，此人於二個月間，飲下煤油十五次，卽不需臥在床上絕對安靜。其後半年間，從事生活上之養生，卽告全治。因有此種之例，故對於煤油效果，已無可疑。</p>

<p>— 蓬心</p>
<p>在社會中圖生存，無異於在海水中要救自己。風浪滔天，魚龍奮怒。能游泳者浮，不能游泳者沈；有憑藉而浮者，浮而生；無憑藉而又不能游者，沉而死。</p>
<p>社會上有許多小說家，往往描寫出極黑暗的局面，惡人何等猙獰，可怕，善人何等乏弱，可憐。而且受壓迫者必是女子，她一定天眞，無罪。或者何等的忠臣被奸臣陷害了，結局如何悽慘。｜｜如是等等事，老　　看了必掉眼淚，太息一番。少年人看了或駭怕，或義形於色，立出許多古古怪怪的志願，産生出許多浪漫的行爲……</p>
<p>難道這一類事眞是幾個多事的人，於茶餘酒後胡縐出來的麽？抑是眞有其事呢？事實大概眞是有的，記錄下來者不過一極小的「隣虛」，　恨者，是縐者手法不甚高明，給出一種淺淺的痕記而已。</p>
<p>所謂黑暗，也眞黑暗到極致了，無怪内地時有小孩失踪，出外學「道」，想當「俠客」；但「俠客」們好像自己的事也多的很，時而要和某人「鬥法」，大半還是要給有錢有權者保鑣，也無救於社會，無補於生民，社會依舊黑暗。然則如之何呢？</p>
<p>一言以蔽之曰：自救而已。</p>
<p>遥想俾士麻克向對面陷在泥淖中的皇子，從容拔出了手槍，於是皇子一躍而出，這是多麽智慧的行爲！我們日常受許多惡意的打擊，往往反生出了好結果，使我們更堅强，並非稀少的事。從來没有一種東西没有弱點，但也没有一種生物没有生存的工具。卽如在苦海中，人非水族，然有手足也可游泳的，總應該有方法可以自處　？</p>
<p>可悲者，並非與黑暗奮鬥之失敗，而是自己並非光明，能自救而不自救，而使其他能自救者復不能自救，一定要大家沈到水底，而且還在嚷「救人」！但這類典型人物在目前似乎還少。</p>

<p>— 風子</p>
<p>把家搬到上海來還是半年前的事，在起初，我是頗存一些戒心的。都市文明曾經吞没了多少人，有恒産的還嚷着活不下去，何况我們這些專靠腦和力來營生的。因此和妻約定了，到這裏來「只准吃苦，不准享福」。</p>
<p>半年工夫總算在這八個字下面混了過去。</p>
<p>我明白自己是一輩子也不會享福的，便是妻有時候有些夢想，可也並不大。我們只想能够安定地生活，不再憂慮；讓我們混在大衆的隊伍裏，來做些應做的事。</p>
<p>可是這些日子却過得一些也不安定。事情不消說是做得很少，我自己更是常常閙病，雖不至於整天躺在牀上，但總覺得懨懨地，没半點兒生氣。每天從門外傳來囂雜的聲音，小販的呌賣，婦女的爭論，孩子們的啼哭，算命的，收舊貨的，玩把戯的，直着喉嚨的呌喊，頓抖的傳進我的耳朶。我彷彿看見每個人臉上的青筋。我厭惡。也許有甚麽預感吧，對於一切求生的行爲，我總覺得分外刺心。</p>
<p>漸漸地，我的不快的情緒加深起來，就遷怒於寓所了。我覺得這裏的地段不好，房間裏又太零亂。書的上面是報紙，報紙上面又是書；檯子的那角是綱筆墨水，那角又是飯碗菜碟。空氣在進裏永流動，早晚没絲兒陽光。我整天的躱在裏面，像瞌睡，可又並不睡熟。</p>
<p>我不能忍受這零亂的一切，不能嚼着苦汁營生，凡苦汁我都得把他吐出來。這里是連一口氣也透不了。於是我决計搬，搬來，也搬我的心。</p>
<p>細雨的早晨我在馬路上躑躅着。從大街到小弄，從深巷到閙市，在每一個人家的門口我探聽。雨打在我的頭上，泥漿濺滿我的身。</p>
<p>我没有一點悔意。</p>
<p>碩商大賈求他們生活的舒齊，詩人藝術家求他們生活的美化，而我，我只求安靜。我不能躺在「沙發」椅上，讓椅背支持着頭，啣着「雪茄」悠然地來劈劃商業上的勝負。我也不能讓皮鞋扣着朱紅的地板閣閣地響，吹着口哨來尋找詩句。我不要舒齊，不要美化，只求安靜。這様，在離着熱閙不遠的一條僻路上，我找定了一處住所。</p>
<p>我們很快的就搬了進去。</p>
<p>一天二天，安靜地過去了。這里没有一點囂雜的聲音，前後左右都是靜悄悄的。我非常高興，决計在這里多讀些書。</p>
<p>幾天以後，因爲偶然嘆了口氣，立刻，在墻壁的暗角里，也發出一種冗長尖銳的嘆聲來，低低地，重又撩起我落寞的情緒。</p>
<p>我搬了家，搬不了我的心。</p>

<p>— 草明</p>
<p>人和人的離聚往往是絕無自由的，我曾經被這様一種思想苦惱了一個很長的期間。雖是活動着的生活，竟像完全没有抵抗力的甲蟲，被搬運着，戲弄着，有時被燃死了，也就無聲無息地從世界上消減掉了……我這様想着的時候，便不能自禁地會想到飛鳥，會想到獅子崗裏的那個客家牧童阿隸。</p>
<p>那天天氣特别熱，太陽像一個在燃燒着的火盆。滿佈着叢草和矮樹的獅子崗，非常乏累地摇顫着牠底長毛，汗水不停地從泉口流出，發出低低的喘息。</p>
<p>在山脚附近割禾的農夫們，除了一條短袴遮蓋着腰身之外，全身紫赤的肌肉都裸露出來。他們不歇地用搭在肩上的濕的高麗巾拭着背脊和胸膛，挺挺腰兒，又把頭睡低了。肉色和男人一様的村婦們，也捲起褲管和袖子，身體一彎一挺地收拾着散碎的稻稈。有時候，他們砲到山脚用手舀口泉水喝喝，又像貓兒似地用濕的手指搓搓臉上的泥塵。</p>
<p>我做着家務的當兒，隔壁的婦人進來跟姊姊借一升米。姊姊聽也没有聽清楚就捉住那女人底手臂，像童話裏那誘惑毋鴉的狐狸様用動聽的話語，誇大地說了一頓關於她底在軍隊裏的丈夫就要擢升了的事，然後做出康概的模様，量了一升米，還加上一撮，才讓那等得不耐煩的婦人回去。</p>

<p>等不到太陽躱藏在獅子崗後面的時分，我一躍就跳上牛背。用竹竿打了一下那馴服的動物，向着草坪那兒去了。地面給一個淺　的黃金罩罩着，青草慢慢地伸着懶腰，像要把白天的疲倦恢復過來。遠望禾田裏的農夫們，爲了休息的時間快到了，也帶點愉快的聲調唱起歌來。我低了頭看那嚼着草的牛，竭力使緊張的心寗靜一下，留意着我那渴望的聲音。</p>

<p>— 姚克</p>
<p>（一）落子館</p>
<p>晚上八點鐘以後，在東安市塲的一角，有急促的弦歌聲在空氣中顫動着。尋着這歌聲走去，跑上一架瑟瑟地震動的樓梯，迎面一排灰黃的玻璃窗，就是所謂「落字館」了。</p>
<p>『請裏頭坐』，一個人開了一扇長窗，陪着笑說。</p>
<p>裏頭是一排一排的半桌，攤着不很白的白布；桌邊的籐椅上，七零八落地坐着一二十個人，張着嘴，望着台上一個十五六歳的姑娘出神。她左手打着綽板，右手的搥子像老母鷄一般向皮鼓上啄，啄，啄。尖銳的聲音像連珠一様從她血紅的嘴裏迸滾到充滿了烟味和茶氣的空氣中。在她身旁坐着二個泥人一般的樂師，機械地奏着三弦和四胡。</p>
<p>『…婆惜說…三郎……鼕　　　塔鼕鼕……』堂官在這歌聲中送上了一壼香片，一碟瓜子，和一絞烏黑的熱手巾。坐在前面的一個瘦老頭兒忽然晃頭晃腦地發出了鴟鶚一般的怪聲丨丨『好！』我喫驚地向台上一看，那姑娘已把綽板擱在鼓面上轉身向後台去了。</p>
<p>台上的樂聲也停了。一個獐頭鼠目的人摇着一柄摺扇跑到我座前，把扇子刷的一聲展開，彎着腰，嘻嘻地說：『劉玉鳳……筱蘋菓……嗓子好……人又漂亮……』</p>
<p>扇上寫的都是曲子的名稱，什麽「草船借箭」，「活捉張三郎」之類；我我摇摇頭表示不要，這摇扇子的丨俗呼「吃飛」丨只得走到另一個座頭，彎腰陪笑，切切查查地向一個胖子低語，連連翹起了大姆指向後台比手勢。大半天，他忽然勝利地把扇子刷的一收，曳着嗓子喊道：『×××筱蘋菓隨便唱一段！』</p>
<p>筱蘋菓從後台出來丨個像有貧血症的，十四五歳的少女丨拿起綽板和搥子，機械地唱起來。她的嗓子又啞又低，唱時連連地咳嗽，分明是重傷風的症狀，不過這那裏算得是病呢！</p>
<p>我不能再聽下去了；立起身來走的時候，望見幕後牆上粘着一張黃紙，上邊寫着：『翼宿星君之位』，兩旁寫着：『清音童子，鼕板郎君。』</p>
<p>這是筱蘋菓唯一的救星</p>

<p>她趕快起身。略略漱洗後，便出門去，到一個最近的報攤，抽出一本文藝半周刊，看的確没有「生之味」在内。她付了它的代價，便緊握了它，直向席卓雲的辦公室走着。</p>
<p>『怎麽，「生之味」没有發表？』依娜拿出她隨帶着的文藝半周刊指着「生之味」該在那里發表的地位中的另一篇文章。</p>
<p>『因爲「生之味」的色彩太濃厚了，要想請你改動一些，所以丨』卓雲解釋着。</p>
<p>『色彩太濃厚？什麽色彩太濃厚？而且，要請我改動一些，爲什麽不早些通知我？要是早通知了我，我改動了丨實在我不曉得要怎様改動起，不是今天還可發表？』</p>
<p>『遲幾期發表其實也没有什麽，』輕淡地。</p>
<p>依娜聽了幾乎要一記耳光打過去，可是她終於强自壓住了自己。</p>
<p>『只是，先生，』她放下了聲音說，『我已對你說過我要錢用，而你說要發表了兩三期才能拿到發表費；現在丨』</p>

<p>— 端生</p>
<p>一　房地業榮盛之由來</p>
<p>上海房地産業之興盛，雖爲工商業發展自然之結果，但多半尚爲非正則的而爲特殊的畸形的之發達。蓋上海之繁盛，在昔常與内地之變亂成反比例。内地多經一次擾亂，則上海必多加若干人口，多建幾幢房屋，多加許多財貨。光復之後，上海之面目一變；幾經内戰，而上海之面目又一變；國民革命軍到達上海建都南京之後，上海之面目，爲之大變特變。表面上固爲豐腴可喜，而其實際如何，尙難言之。以上海爲吐納之口，而非消化之胃。進口之貨，旣須消納於内地，出口之貨，又必來自内地。故内地爲本，而上海爲末。本强則枝榮，根支已枯，本能獨茂者，未之有也。上海之盛衰，旣繫於内地之榮枯，何以房地産業獨以内地多故，反見發皇？此正爲政治關係也。兹略言其故：</p>
<p>（一）上海爲有租界，歷次内亂，雖受影響，尚得安全。於是每經一次内亂，内地人士，輒以上海爲避難之區。有資産者，卽以爲藏貨之所。久之，遂亦留居滬上。</p>
<p>（二）國民革命軍北上之時，扶助農工，剷除土劣，於是鄉間較有資産者，爲避禍計，往往携其所有，徙居上海作寓公焉。</p>
<p>（三）房租加貴，係自民十信交風潮之後，而逐年上升。蓋其時正受歐戰平定後復興之小惠，各種事業勃興，謀事之徒，麕集滬隅，居住之所，深感不足。</p>
<p>（四）建都南京之後，重要人物，類皆於滬上築寄　，隱隱成爲北方之天津。各省謀事之夫，亦皆以滬上爲行李往來之所，策畫之地。　（五）上海一港，貿易發達，與年俱增，房地産業之榮盛，亦爲當然之結果。</p>
<p>（六）因歷年内地匪共之爲患，旣以上海爲唯一投資安全之區，遊資乃集中於上海。欲求出路，投於工商業則無此才能，又虞損蝕。投機於紗花標金市塲，則風險太大。長存於銀行，則利息太薄。無已，祗有房地産與公債，比較的尚爲可靠，遂注自於斯。在金融業方面，突然增加不少存欵，苦無去路，於是亦以房地産公債爲唯一之投資。此房地産業所以不受世界經濟恐慌影響而轉昻首獨前也。（？）</p>
<p>（七）市塲上房地産業買賣抵押交易，甚爲便當，因此而經營之者愈衆。</p>
<p>以上僅就房地産業近年所以發達之原因，略述其梗概，非敢謂發達之理由，已盡於此矣。茲再言其房租高漲之由來：</p>
<p>（一）由於地價之高漲。上海地價，如與三十年前較，所漲將十倍於兹。卽最近三年之地價，亦逐步向上，互相比較，所漲亦在三四成之間。此地價之上漲，當然爲房租高漲之唯一原因。</p>
<p>（二）由於水木工料之昻貴。年來建築材料，幾無一不來自外洋。自金貴銀賤，外洋進口之物料，又無一不昻貴；工資亦視昔爲鉅。建築之成本加重，所取之租金自高。但自英日先後放棄金本位，去春美國復繼起於後，滙票跌落，兩三年來，物料當亦大賤矣。</p>
<p>（三）由於建築設備之日精。年來國人求享用，較之求生産爲有進步。一切惟恐不洋化，不舒服。因此房屋式様，力求新頴。内部裝置，務期精美。房屋造本，亦因以增高不少。</p>
<p>（四）由於經租賬房之作崇。經租賬房往往高抬房租，濫收小租挖費以及其他小費，剥削住戶，爲害匪尠。又或用修理爲名，或藉其他名義，濫加房租，稍一不遂，則勒令出屋。至經租人員，氣燄之盛，若爲洋商房産，則幾忘其爲中國人矣。房客有爲避免加租，寗可坍漏，不願修理，以致肇巨禍傷人命者亦有所聞。此以「猶太式」之房地商人爲最多。</p>
<p>故房租之昻貴，固有其成本關係。但亦有爲業主及經租賬房祇顧一已厚利，不惜房客困苦艱難所造成也。</p>
<p>二　房地業困難之種因</p>
<p>房地産業發達及房租高貴之由來，略如上述。但盛極必衰，物極必反。有生産發達，而後有過剩之恐慌；有勞務增加，而後有失業之苦痛。房地業自亦不能例外。當初供應不足，祗患無屋可賃，今則閙市儘多空屋，昔日建築尙在築笆平地，而已定租一空，比則登報召租之外，尚在電車張貼廣告，猶無人過問。不收小租，市政府三令五申，仍多陽奉陰違，今則自動免除，甚至有訂租一年可免除一月之房租矣。何今昔榮枯之甚，事實爲之也，謂之何哉！請申其說：</p>
<p>（一）上海市已發達至如何程度，此無人能詳言之也。但曰有三百餘萬之人口，不知此三百餘萬人口，能負擔如目下之房租者，有幾分之幾，亦無人能言之。一般人常謂房租占其全部生活費百分之二十五以上。然如人口較多之輩，照現在之房價，賃屋一幢，最　非　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　去其半矣。故以現在之房租，與一般人收入作爲比較，覺其與現實生活程度，高出太遠，不勝負擔。於是故鄉尚有一椽可居者，不得不送眷還鄉，而度其個人生活於滬上。</p>
<p>（二）一二八之役，僑寓滬上之人士，紛紛避難回鄉，數不在少。戰後工商業凋敝之影響，亦漸深刻化。歇業停閉，裁員减工，層出不已。向之居滬上者，不僅由大屋遷居小屋，獨租改爲分租，甚至退租回里，或避難回鄉之後，卽不重來上海，此於房業自不無影響者也。</p>
<p>（三）自世界經濟恐慌彌漫而來，加以中國本爲受侵略之國家，年年入超，財貨外流，已至山窮水盡之地步。内地則農村經濟破産，上海工商事業，亦頓呈外强中乾之象。原有之營業尙難維持，新張設立更爲無望。且市房一經翻造，不僅形式軒昂，自二樓改建爲三四層，卽房租亦增加甚巨。財力較弱者對之，不禁興望洋之嘆。遂致新落成之市房，往往召租招紙變色，而猶無人承租。其房東資力較裕房租堅持不讓者，雖在商業中心，亦致塵封蛛積，空閉年餘，依然未啓也。</p>
<p>（四）近十年來，舊屋之翻造與新屋之建築，丁丁之聲，不絕於耳。尤其是滬西及法租界之西區，昔日蔓草荒烟，今皆夏屋渠渠，望衡對宇矣。單就公共租界而言，據聞自民國十年以至二十二年，建造之房屋，約有八萬數千所，最近之五年，占有三萬二千餘所，法租界及滬南閘北尙不與焉。有此巨數房屋增加，而房租昂貴又非一般所能堪，此房屋所以多空閉也。</p>
<p>（五）因地價高漲，房租昂貴之影響，爲業主者又皆善於計算，建兩層與建三層，地基相同，即增加一層之建築費，亦屬有限。於是大都改建三層樓。此一層之增加，亦於需要上有所影響也。</p>
<p>故房地産業所受之影響，爲工商業之衰落，以及一般經濟能力之　乏；加以供給過多，遂有今日之現象。</p>
<p>三　减租運動之經過</p>
<p>去年（廿二年）十二月中滬市第一特區第二十七區分會，以市面蕭條，工廠倒閉，商店歇業，物價低落，而獨房租高貴，市民生活受莫大之威脅爲理由；主張厲行减租運動，以輕負擔。本年一月六日，第一特區市民聯合會决議組織委員會；進行减租運動。隨於一月十六日在市商會舉行本市各團體减免房租代表大會，决議組織上海市减低房租委員會，推定執行委員三十五人。發表宣言，其内容首叙外貨充斥，市塲凋零，失業增加，經濟不况，以及一二八戰後事態更加嚴重之情形，其後略謂：</p>
<p>「（上略）上海房租之昂，本爲吾國各地冠。歷來社會環境，不如今日之迫，房客苟能維持，孰願自相紛擾。詎知當此元氣未復，市况愈衰之時，竟有少數資本階級，及經營地産者，不顧民生，惟知自利，一再提高租額，年前月僅十餘元之房屋，今且增至數十金。加租難敷大慾，房屋自可翻新，一唱百和，沿成通例。社會不察，聽之自然。由是凡爲房客省，力難勝任，怨恨爲之叢生，物議爲之騰沸。一家一店之血汗，大半盡輸於房東，其他必要之開支，雖急亦惟聽之。有時設或延期不激，則除經租帳房之非理舉動外，律師催信，法院傳票，紛至沓來，幾無寗刻。如果負氣出屋，無如事有不能；聽其壓抑，則又勢難應付。居不能安，業不能樂。……日來閙市之間，常餘空屋。追租之訴，時有紛爭。卽召租廣告，亦多有减租若干，送租一月之新例。是更足證明一方盤剥之難恃，一方能力之枯渴。……狂瀾旣倒，豈得倖存。市面復興，始無後慮。與其衰望之難成，何如薄利以持久。……如能幡然覺悟，自動减讓房租，則匪特房客感之，整個社會亦獲益匪淺。……」</p>
<p>以上卽减租方面認爲應行减租之理由事實也。至是减租運動，風靡全市，牽涉各界。市商會仍本一二八事後减租運動時之主張，以爲「就法津觀點言，關係雙方契約。就經濟觀點言，關係全體國民利益。」婦結於「至應如何持平辦理，應由市政府主持核辦。」而表示不能參加任何一種會議。</p>
<p>减租運動全乃進一步，通告减租辦法：</p>
<p>（一）期限　自二十三年一月起至廿六年底止。</p>
<p>（二）折扣　民國十四年以前所造房屋，以九折付租。十四年至十六年分所造房屋，以八折付租。十七年至十九年分所造房屋，以七折付租。二十年至廿二年分所道房屋，以六折付租。</p>
<p>（三）欠租　民國二十三年以前所欠舊租，須於一年内拔還之。</p>
<p>（四）待遇　三房客一律待遇。房捐仍照舊繳付。各學校亦組織减租運動委員會，並有請市長表示减租意見之說。此减租運動經過之大概　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　四　業主方面之態度</p>
<p>自有减租運動以來，業主方面，迄無明顯之表示，行所無事，照常收租。但據各方面非正式之表示，就其談話中所得，業主所以未能减租者，以爲</p>
<p>（一）上海房地産業，多爲營業性質，除少數華洋業主及各銀行所置産業外，大都購置産業後，卽向行商抵押，可以六七成，故有三四成之墊本，卽可爲業主矣。因此房租收入，尙須繳付押欵之息金。設不幸而空屋較多，租金尙不敷息金之數，則須虧本矣。</p>
<p>（二）因近來一般車用慾之突飛猛進，所有房屋之圖様，力求新頴洋化，内中一切設備，更較舊有房屋爲完美，故房租雖高，而成本亦重。</p>
<p>（三）則地價飛漲。最近數年來地價暴漲，捐稅增加，雖如公共租界工部局有准將新估價所增加之部分數目，入折繳納，但業主負擔終歸加重。</p>
<p>（四）現在市面之不景氣，業主亦受其害。房客由大屋遷居小屋，由獨居而爲分屋出租，以致供過於求，空屋較多。業主所受損失不少；如再减租，不無雪上加霜。</p>
<p>（五）據估計，上海最近八年新建築，約値五萬萬元，加以舊時建築，當在二十萬萬元左右。而其中三分之二，做有押欵，以抵押六成計算，則有十二萬萬元。如减租之後，則此十二萬萬元之押欵，以及專事買賣房地産之信託銀行，將同受影響矣。</p>
<p>（六）業主如有虧累，對於新建築事業，勢必出於停頓，則此數十萬水木工人生計，將受損失。</p>
<p>（七）閘北方謀復興，若减租之後，何人肯再投資興築。</p>
<p>以上業主就其自身之利害計之也。房租所以昂貴，减租所以不許，在業主之意，固不未嘗不從各方面兼籌並顧而道其所以難道之苦衷也。</p>
<p>五　减租問題之面面觀</p>
<p>减租運動，旣已波及全市，且聞有若干處房客，已於本年一月起將租金存於銀行，不繳付於業主。此事之處置，如操之之過激，則激成風潮，置之不理，則蔓延益廣，均非可以不了了之。卽就變方所說，亦各持之有故，言之成理。今惟有於兩者間權其利害輕重，一爲研究，非敢云當，聊備一說而已！</p>
<p>爲减租說者，以爲食住均爲民生之首要問題。不必遠證異邦，但問當米價昻貴時候，政府居然出來維持，限制米價，禁阻上漲，違者置之以奸商，繼之以法辦。夫糧食商人，亦係將本求利，米價上漲，究非操縱所能盡濟。然而政府不惜嚴厲處置者，以食爲民天，民不可以一日無食，爲民生計，自應抑制小已之私利，保全大衆之利益也。住亦未嘗一日可無。經營房地業者，亦猶似經營糧食業也。糧價上漲，政府能爲人民出而限制；何獨於房價上漲，政府置諸不理。豈「食」的價格可限，「住」的價格獨不可限乎？此非事理之平者也。業主則以契約爲理由，一經訂定，非致期滿，無可異議。卽無書面契約，則以歷來所表示承諾者，亦契約也，契約不可毁。此絕端契約說之允正與否？姑置不論。卽重契約說，法亦許其租賃物價値之舁降，得爲增减租金之聲請。何况工商凋敝，民生艱窘，乃目前已成之事實。卽無此事態。何以業主增加房租，可不問契約之有無？可以物價皆貴爲理由，不顧一切而加租。業主之加租可，房客之减租獨不可，是何厚於業主而薄於房客耶？或曰，房地産業，亦爲金融業之命脈所繫；而爲之業主者，類皆兼營其他事業。今如减租，業主之其他事業，勢必連帶受累，若不幸而竟波及於金融業，則其爲禍之巨，非可言宣。此其爲說，在减租者，以爲今之證券，大半爲銀行界所有，用以爲發鈔及存欵之保證凖備。然有去冬之暴跌，不聞牽動市面金融至若何程度，房租酌减，而其影響乃有如是之鉅耶？復有爲成本之說者，以爲地價高，建築費貴，以今之租金，不過數厘利息，若復减租，不將使業主虧蝕乎？但在减租說者以爲房地業旣爲一種商業，商業不能無盈虧，今之工商業，進本貴而出本賤者不知多少，房地業獨不可虧本乎？宜無是理。</p>
<p>吾人於雙方之辯論，不必爲之詳述。但减租卽可以復興工商業，未免期許過甚，卽减租之後，空閒房屋，能盡出租，亦是夢想之談。蓋造成今日之局面，非一地一業一右所能解决。惟事實已如此，房客則堅不付租，業主則置之不理，相持不下，彼此不安。業主之租金，正業主投資之利息，何况尙有押息在乎？設租金無所得，豈非子金無着，尚須倒貼利息，則與房客易地以處，試問何以爲情。然業主對不付租金者，亦難盡訴請法，收押固無此囹囤，封閉亦不勝其繁。欠租如月累而上，將來收取，必更費事。與其殺雞以求卵，毋寗斷腕而全臂，所請兩害相權取其輕也。故以爲</p>
<p>（一）市政當局不應漠視此次事件，任令雙方糾纒莫結。應於不泥法，不畏謗，不動於雙方之情勢下，確定一比較公允之原則，以爲處置本事件之張本。</p>
<p>（二）房租昻貴，地價高漲有以致之。而地價高漲，土地估價之提高，亦有以促成之。蓋爲稅收起見，地價高，則稅收自增。在房地業，係營業性質，亦但望今日所買之房産，明日卽漲起一萬或五千，一轉乎間，坐獲巨利，故估價提高，正中下　。雖納稅加重，則産經脫手，與我何涉，在新買進者，亦同様望地價之上漲，以便轉賣，因此稅收當局，與房地業主，志願相同，地價因估價而上漲，估價因地價而提高，互爲因果，循環不已，造成今日之地價。故欲减租，理應减稅。如房彺依九折實收，地稅亦因照九折實徵，方爲权允。徵聞某處估計地價，先將地價八折之後，再行七五折六折，實際僅照地價之三六折徵稅，則又容當别論。</p>
<p>（三）减租標凖，應由當局根據最近房租之增加率，量爲制定，以求其平。惟有數點可加考慮者：卽</p>
<p>甲·照原房租額，業主從後加租者，應就其所加租額，大爲减折。</p>
<p>乙·新造房屋出放後之已减租者，如認爲恰當，得免再减。</p>
<p>（四）减租方式，就按月房租，酌予折扣；或於合同規定，租賃滿一年者，得免一月兩月或若干時期之房租。</p>
<p>（五）减租之期限，應有一定，過期回復原狀。但有特别情形者另議。</p>
<p>（六）本年一月分起之欠租，應自减租實行之日起，一律付清；其餘亦應定於某時期内還清。</p>
<p>以上所云，亦非着法。端望有賢明之處置，解此糾紛。須知遷廢爲害事之媒，據大則收拾不易。斟酌乎情理之中，雙方能不爲已甚。否則縱能相安於一時；一旦有事，則舊案重提，糾葛益甚也。</p>

<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>自殺的潮流，近來是更其澎湃了，而在這一浪濤中，國家命脈與社會精華所托的青年竟成了主角，我們不能不認爲是一個嚴問題。因爲青年不僅有堅强的體格，能够爲國効勞，進益社會，而且具有滿腔的熱血及英勇的精神，實爲這一病弱腐朽民族亟起圖存的有力酵素。</p>
<p>然而青年所特有的熱血與精神，都用之以勇於吞鴉片服安眠，無論其「不得不死」的理由爲何，終爲「扼腕太息」，且亦不敢苟同的事件。</p>
<p>這些貿然輕生的青年，他們之所以自經者，有的是演了戀愛的悲劇，有的出於家庭的糾紛，有的緣於經濟的壓迫，有的感受社會的險惡，揆其個中情理，處身歷境，自然有不能不使人萌厭世之念的原因在，但是他們的缺點就在於死前加以理智的裁判，將已身的遭遇當作社會問題中之一來看待。而自己的慘苦的際遇，絕非自殺的消極抵抗能够感動人心，却只有在整個社會問題的解决中來解决。</p>
<p>於現存制度之下，男女愛情成爲公司裏懸價待估的華美商品，家庭關係乃勢力的結合，經濟壓迫與各種罪惡，理是當然而又必然。在這様的環境，正表示着富有熱情與英勇精神的青年負着重大的歷史使命，應積極起來改造現社會，而現時許多青年却在一有失意之後，便如喪考妣憤世嫉俗到「刎頸見志」，無疑的是對現實的惡社會「繳械投誠」。這在同一的悲慘命運中掙扎的社會羣裏，也許還能博得稍許的同情，但在唯恐社會人心思亂的人們看來，則爲正中下懷，不能不彈冠相慶的事態。</p>
<p>盛極一時的自殺，雖其情節再如何的千奇百怪，特殊複雜，而終極的原因却任隨如何逃不出「孔方兄」的圈套，解脫這一圈套，正需要爲自殺潮流主角的青年，以勇於自殺的精神，轉而致力於掃滅驅人自殺的舊社會制度。自殺之風若長此下去，非但不能擊碎舊勢力的惡魔，而且阻遏了徬徨於時代浪潮中的人民的反抗勇氣，將他們誘入自我的毁滅。</p>
<p>然而我們這些不失爲熱情的青年，不將所遭遇的悲慘事態看作社會的病態來處理，却認爲註定命運，以自戕來解决，這實在是青年的歧途！</p>
<h3 id="c234">借錢的藝術 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 清</p>
<p>窮，對於咱眞可說是最親暱的伙伴的，一年之中大部分的時間不曾離開身邊，像一個殘酷的惡魔，在無情地抽打着我，把我的身子和我的思想一天天的壓扁下去，因爲窮，借錢過日自然是家常便飯了。所以對於借錢一道，咱自信是不無相黨經騐的。一般人一定以爲這是一回簡單不過的事，想借錢便去借，有什麽藝術不藝術，實際上並不如此輕易，知道個中味况的人一談起借錢是會得自然而然的縐起眉來。不知道借錢的藝術，我敢斷定他不但不能達到目的，而且凖會碰一鼻子灰的。撲了空不算，還招了一肚子晦氣，那才活該。如果自問你的生活無論如何終不能避免這一回事。那末你對於借錢的藝術就不得不加以一番研究的工夫。並不是開玩笑，於是咱們窮小子所應該有的本領。</p>

<p>窮到了了不得的時候，也就是說到了非去借錢不行的時候。未去之前，你得先把所有關係的朋友親戚細心加以分析一下；究竟那一個比較上時事的人你就天南地北，國家大事的無所不談，總之你要摸着他的個性和嗜好，然後投其所好的攀談下去，這様談呀談的，便會自然，自然給你一個機會轉上正面文章去。看到了可以談入正題的時候，你就移過身來，凑近對方的身邊，不可忸怩，不可臉紅，否則一侷促會使想好了話便會出了軌，而致露了馬脚來。所以必要用一種堂堂正正的態度。從容不迫的叙述原委。但不能一古腦兒會說個精光，要觀察對方聽了你的話之後是怎様的表情，以及說什麽，留下來的話便是作爲補充上文不足之用。如果對方馬上滿口應承，那當然是最好没有的了。但萬一他不說可否，而若有所思的沉想，在這時，你要靜觀氣色，看其如何答覆，不可急急加以追迫，要是隔了半天他才「唔」他開了一聲，下文你也就可想而知了。他一定不說是因爲近來銀根緊，一時無法可想；便是說今天眞不凑巧，過幾天才來看看，大家都是很要好的，有法可想當然盡量帮忙，這麽一套話自然會呌你一聽全身冷了半截的，甚而至於氣憤也是可能有可能借錢給你；那一個屬於爽快，那一個屬於慳吝。定擇之後，再出發，以免空跑一趟，錢没到手，反折了車費，或白跑了腿。旣然决定對象，算是第一步工夫完畢。但在未見面之先，得預先把見面時所要說的話先在心裏編排好，以免臨時發生了蹩扭。</p>
<p>更難應付而又最難受的塲面於是接着來了。譬如你已經遇見了要敲他竹槓的主人。萬萬不能一碰頭便一五一十把你要來借錢的意思說了出來，因爲這是最使人討厭的，尤其是有錢借你的人，他聽見你一進門就開口要錢，心裏邊必然會立卽起了一陣反感，暗暗地覺得你進傢伙眞混帳，一要借錢才想起了他，平日則絕跡不到，雖然他臉上還是嘻嘻地和你週旋着。但你的計劃，說不定就因爲在這上面失敗了的。到這裏，便要使用起承轉合的方法了，就是說，你務裝成一副像是來閒談並無其他作用的滿不在乎的神情，同時要搜索一些無聊的話來敷衍，假如這人是喜歡清談的，那你就無妨搬出一些合其口胃的話來，假如是一個好管的事。但氣憤最好祇放在心頭，别絲毫表示出來。同時要若無其事的回答，没有關係的，我則别處去走走，過幾天我再來看看，還請帮忙。於是你就滿面笑容告辭，這様你給下一面留下了餘地。</p>
<p>這種步驟隨時隨地均可應用，但也不是那様像　八股文章的呆頭呆腦，此全在各人之觀察環境，隨機應變，能善用者爲益無窮，不能善用者則到處碰壁。尚有一宗，就是看面色，看情形，要是瞧見你一走進時，卽刻擺出一面令人作嘔的難看的臉孔；或則你未開口他已　　蕭恩回到家裏：一方想起老漁翁被打太可憐；一方想着自己且無文錢納魚稅丨或將被打死：因愁苦地歎道：「唉！我這老骨頭怎受得了呢？」桂英道：「那眞是兇狼養的惡狗呵！」</p>
<p>丁員外查得簿上蕭恩魚稅未繳，便把郭先生呌來道：「到期還不將稅繳來，有意抗稅，這還了得！」隨着郭先生去催。大敎師在旁道：「那老傢秋大概又是要我賞他幾拳才馴服的吧？」</p>
<p>說了一大篇比你更窮的窮話。那你也就毋須自討没趣，趕快一走了事爲佳。</p>
<p>說來說去，都是一些老生常談的話。不過借錢到底總是一樁不討好的事，不光要拿手腕，更要緊還是在於要面皮厚，不怕碰釘子，有勇敢把自己的熱臉孔去親人家的冷屁股。畏羞，蕩臉皮，千萬是幹不了的。</p>

<p>— 尼克</p>
<p>照文明國度的計算法，我還不足二十三歳的年經小伙子？我自己郤時常覺得太老了。形態上？幾年來南北奔走，風塵僕僕，在我多紋的額角已覓不見青春的影踪了，但這似乎還說得過去的事。我的心爲什麽和年齡不相稱的老起來呢？縱然有像小伙子一般的歡樂時候，過後我的心更消沉了。這似乎也没有辦法的事，無論什麽驚奇的娱樂，都引不起我的興趣，有時免强想振作起來，不過强裝了笑容增助人家的興趣罷了。然而我是個不肯示弱的人，我寗願把眼淚藏在笑聲的後幕做出小伙子的模様來，精神上的痛苦誠不能以尺度來測量了。生性强倔，有什麽辦法呢！</p>
<p>在最近幾年來，我更怪僻了，時常喜歡獨自關在一間屋裏抽着烟幻想。將經過的瑣事，生活的血迹，一一加以回味。喜怒哀樂像一個瘋似的。或者整天到街上去呢，瞧瞧馬路上的行人，看看電影院間前的景片，一個人會那機地浪費光隂的。記得一次下雨天，不知怎機觸得不樂意起來，披了雨衣獨自到法國公園公。安南巡捕投着異様的目光，他也没有檢查我的派司。我坐在茅亭中，仰面注視着天空的浮雲，被風吹着的雨絲，倒胸襟開朗起來。兩個鐘頭之後，回到家中又一如平常的吃飯，工作。</p>
<p>就是對於要錢的飯碗問題，我也是照常的任信妄爲。在這社會中做一個小職員，本來是大人先生們的出氣筒。高興的時候，贊賞你幾句，使你受寵若驚：不高興的時候，臭駡你一頓，出出别處受來的烏氣。而像我這一類的人物呢，根本生來是小職員的骨格，然而也天</p>

<p>了大人物的膊　。吃人家的飯，忠於做事，這一點不能否認的。但是作爲大人物的打靶，我就這様的不知調換過多人工作。</p>
<p>去年生了一塲大病，眞是窮得像　三一様，舅舅介紹我到一個聞人之類海上略有名望的家裏去謀事。第一次，眼睛生上天頂的門公回答我出門去了，我就覺得不高興。舅舅費了多少婉轉的話開通我，（其實我知道得明明白白的）那小聞人確是有要公出門去的，爲了舅舅的疼愛我，無可奈何的第二次再上門去。眞是氣數，說過了幾句老話之後｜｜從他嘴裏說起來更使人討厭｜｜就忙着送客，自然「待機會……」等話在他們是不會忘却的，而且和我舅舅是很知己的朋友哩。</p>
<p>一切都自怪書讀得太多，然而讀者不要笑我，我是個大學都没有畢業的小子，但是我就認我書讀的太多；也因爲從十七歳起，獨自東奔西闖，自然人生閱歷太豐富，對於這現社會就感得太不能容納我這個人了。諸位大人先生們不要笑我，小伙子是不知天高地遠的，照我的說話，就活躍出一個任信妄爲的影子來。</p>
<p>我也想戀愛，或者可以改變過來，但是我没有多量的金錢作爲變愛之用，這並不是說天下的女子都是拜金主義者，交際費用却是無論如何不可少的。所以直到現在，懷着一段老年人的心獨自做瘋子一般望天快些塌下來。</p>

<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>「罪惡！私生兒！」</p>
<p>「慘！窮人的孩子！」</p>
<p>被這一種不平凡的聲調所刺激，我在西海影戲院附近一片空地的籬笆邊停住脚，由人羣中擠進去，呵！赫然在目的，是一個被棄的小生命！呼吸已經斷絕了，細的眼睛緊閉着，泥沙塗滿了上下唇及小嘴内，臉頰上柔嫩的没肉呈着淡白色，身上穿一套青紅花布衫，外面再裹上一條舊圍巾，身旁放着兩個破草袋，這條小生命，就這様地在這天棺地槨裏，永别了這刹那因緣的人生逆旅，安寂地眠去了！</p>
<p>「這大約出世了有多少日子？」我凄然在向一位蹲着的老媽子發問。</p>
<p>「不過幾天吧了！」她抬起頭來看我一眼。</p>
<p>「怎様死的？爲什麽滿口盡是泥沙？」我接着再問。</p>
<p>「那可不知道。想就是用這泥沙把他塞絕氣的吧？眞慘！」她蹙着眉嘘了一口氣。</p>
<p>「罪惡呵！必然是個私生兒！」一個中年婦人這様說。</p>
<p>「窮人養不活，也常是這様遺棄在路旁的！」又一位老頭兒慨嘆的聲。</p>
<p>「嚇！算不得希罕！上海地方到處都可看見！」另一短衫男子說着就走了開去。</p>
<p>不錯，上海社會是個罪惡的魔窟，什麽奇異物事件未曾發生過，區區一具新生的小屍暴露在路旁，怎麽就算得希罕？這被棄的小生命，揣度起來，大概不是私生兒，便是窮苦人家的孩子。私生兒爲什麽會被棄呢？因爲他不是「父母之命，媒妁之言」下的産物，而是「無恥男女」的「遺孼；」在現時舊禮敎和因襲思想餘毒還瀰漫着的中國家庭中或社會裏，是容不着這種東西的存在的，所以少有人敢撫育他。窮人的孩子又爲什麽會被棄呢？在貧富不均的現社會當一個窮苦人家願意把自己的血汗出賣而得不到雇主，或作了牛馬，而所獲尚養不活自己的時候，孩子也常會遭逢到這種厄運。眞的，無論被棄的是私生兒，或是窮人的孩子，都是一種罪惡！但這罪惡應歸什麽人去負呢？私生兒也同様是人，同様可愛；你能知道他的父母不是斷盡肝腸才把他棄掉的嗎？然而他不被父母遺棄，也要給社會淘汰。窮人的孩子也同様是人，也和富家的孩子一般，能引人疼惜。然而他有時也難急很可憐的要被父母忍心地抛丢了；因爲父母不遺棄他，社會也要把他迫死的。這是什麽人的罪惡？果是爲父母者本身的罪惡嗎？社會乎！你太慘酷了！</p>
<p>我懷着滿腔的悲痛，默默然跑開了這凄慘的境地。走到了很遠，我還回過一次頭，對那被棄的小生命，發出了這様的禱告：「祝你早脫離了這汚濁的人間！」</p>

<p>編者先生</p>
<p>現在我有一個很難解决的問題，就是我哥哥有許多無聊的朋友，他知道我有男朋友，就用强迫手段來打我的朋友，並且還要錢。一日一日的下去，我的朋友對於我的態度，很是冷淡，眞使我莫明其妙。慢慢的被我知道他冷淡我的原故了，這時候我心是何等的傷心呀。</p>
<p>第二三年的友誼都被無聊的人所破壞了，我是一個被舊禮敎壓迫的弱女子，怎能和一般無聊的人奮鬥呢？</p>
<p>我現在知道人生是痛苦的，不久我眞要和這萬惡的世界分别了。先生請你指示我一個好方法。祝你</p>
<p>精神愉快　　夏月娥</p>
<p>答：你哥哥的那些朋友，不但是太「無聊」，簡直可以說是流氓，你哥哥根本就不應與這些人交友，卽使他們没有欺侮，你的男朋友。所以你現在第一步應當勸告你哥哥，以後應當與那班無聊朋友疎遠，抱着「敬鬼神而遠之」的態度，這不但爲你自己，同時亦是爲你哥哥。第二步，你應當問你哥哥「對於你的男朋友是否滿意；」如果是「滿意」的，那你就要讓他以後不准朋友們胡鬧；如他是不滿意甚而至於無聊朋友之「胡鬧」竟是他指使的，那你也可責問他爲什麽要用這様下流手段。因爲他不願意，他可以勸告你不要與你朋友親近，這様胡調；他有什麽好處，名譽又何在。老實說，這種下流手段，不但是可恥，並且也根不能破壞你們的關係。總之你哥哥的朋友，那種行爲根本違法的，如果滋擾得利害的話，你簡直可以鳴警法辦，不過看你哥哥面上，或者爲了多一事不如少一事起見，所以你就妨讓人哥哥去替你解决。假使他不是糊塗虫，我想，是决計不會坐視不顧的。</p>
<p>至於你的朋友，對你冷淡，雖則不無理由，但這種態度究不應當，因爲這旣非你的指使，而且對於這些人也根本用不着畏懼。男女社交祇要光明磊落，誰可以干涉，何况這種拆稍行爲；所以，他對於那些人，不妨以正當手段解决，卽鳴警法解。　編者</p>

<p>Fu Zuoyi and Zhu Shaoliang to Oversee the Matter</p>
<p>Fu and Sun to Leave Baotou for Peiping Today</p>
<p>Order in Ningcheng Has Been Restored</p>
<p>(Beiping) The aftermath of Sun's army: those near Dengkou and Shizuizi are to be supervised by Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengshou and reorganized under the direction of Fu Zuoyi; those near Ningxia and Pingluo are to be supervised by Ma Hongkui, Hu Zongnan's troops, and Yuan's regiment, and reorganized under the direction of Zhu Shaoliang. In the future, it is planned to transfer them to the border regions of Ningdong, Suixi, and Gansu. He Yingqin has expressed to Sun personally that he will not pursue past offenses. (25th Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua telegram: Sun Dianying and Fu Zhan Kui arrived at Linhe on the 24th to meet with Fu Zuoyi. They made a brief stop in Linhe and then came to Sui. It is still undecided whether they will go to Peiping or stay. Fu will not return to Sui for the time being but will remain in Linhe to oversee the reorganization of Sun's army. A large part of Sun's army has disintegrated, with some awaiting reorganization and others fleeing as bandits. Jin army cavalry advance units are currently stationed in the Shizuizi area. (25th Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe, 24th telegram: Sun's army has been under attack from both the Ning and Jin armies in recent days and is on the verge of collapse. Except for Ding Futing, who led three regiments to surrender to Ma Hongkui, the remaining units have retreated to the vicinity of Dengkou, nominally awaiting reorganization, but the morale is low, and the order is chaotic. The local military authorities have ordered Brigade Commander Tian Shumei to lead troops in Dengkou to suppress them, prohibiting them from wandering around, and ordered the brigades of Jin Zhonghe, Wang Tingying, and Zeng Yan Yi to deploy defenses in San Shenggong to intercept and await a solution. Wang Jingguo rushed to San Shenggong on the morning of the 23rd to deploy defenses. Sun is determined to leave the army and has arrived in Linhe with Fu Zhan Kui to discuss post-war arrangements with Fu Zuoyi. (25th Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying arrived in Linhe on the 24th and will go to Wuyuan and then Baotou on the 25th, accompanied by only a dozen or so people. Fu Zhan Kui is traveling with him. The Jin and Sui armies have completed the arrangements for the reorganization of Sun's army. Currently, there are still over 30,000 men, including Liu Yueting, Yu Shiming, Lu Fengnian, and Zhuansun Ziyu, gathered between Dengkou and Shizuizi, with nearly 20,000 guns, requesting to be incorporated. Fu has forwarded this request to the Military Affairs Commission for review. Fu, accompanied by Zhao Chengshou, went to San Shenggong on the morning of the 25th. (25th Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hu Yukun said that Sun Dianying has come east with Fu Zhankui. It is not yet certain whether he will come directly to Peiping. The location of Sun's residence is mostly in Bing, as his family is there. If Sun can come to Peiping, then everything can be guaranteed safely without any problems. After Fu arrived at San Shenggong, a telegram was sent to Peiping saying, "Brother Dianying, my brother, and Li Ming, Zhang Xuanze have arrived here from Dengkou and have met with Wang Jingguo. We plan to go to Linhe tomorrow morning and then to Baotou, and will return east from Baotou on the 26th." (25th Day Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui telegraphed Peiping, saying that since Sun Dianying left the army and went into retirement, after Sun's troops surrendered and returned to righteousness, the Sun's troops in the suburbs of Ningyuan have all retreated to designated locations to await inspection, and order in the city has gradually been restored. (25th Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying may arrive in Baotou today. Since Sun's family lives in Baotou, he may stay for a few days to take care of matters. According to sources, the authorities have decided to let him choose his own place of residence, but it cannot be in Tianjin, Peiping, or Bing. However, Sun intends to stay in Tianjin for a short time and prepare for a trip abroad in the near future. The rumor that Sun intends to settle in Taiyuan is actually still difficult. Regarding the post-war issue of his troops, the authorities are now awaiting instructions from Chiang. Generally speaking, the teams that have surrendered may be incorporated as appropriate. The measures to be taken for Sun's army now between Shizuizi and Pingluo will be determined after Chiang's instructions arrive in Peiping. (25th Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe telegram: After the Jin and Sui armies captured Dengkou, He Yingqin telegraphed Fu Zuoyi on the 22nd to commend him, saying, "The officers and soldiers have worked diligently in capturing Dengkou this time. The good news has been received with great satisfaction. The rebel Sun has been severely defeated, and the trend of collapse has been formed. I hope that you will supervise and encourage all units to make greater efforts and quickly complete the second phase of the attack in the midst of difficulties and hardships, annihilate the remaining bandits, and lay the foundation for the Northwest. This is what I hope for." (25th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) The commander of the Second Division, Feng Qinzhai, returned to the province from Tongguan on the 24th. According to him, the defense deployment in northern Shaanxi has been completed, and it is impossible for Sun's troops to flee south. The local security and transportation in Tongguan will be improved. (25th Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Song to Inspect Eastern Chahar in the Coming Days</p>
<p>Jia Ziwen's Troops to Take Over Defense of Chicheng</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed Peiping, saying that over a hundred Japanese soldiers from Tangfengtu in eastern Chahar, traveling in a dozen armored vehicles and carrying luggage, departed for Heihefan early on the 23rd. There has been no recent movement from the Japanese army at Heidakzi Camp. Wherever the Japanese army goes, they force the people to hang Japanese and puppet national flags and hire villagers to guide them. There has been Japanese military vehicle traffic between Xifengzhai and Fengning for days, with the original garrison being transferred. The puppet troops stationed in Guyuan send scouts to various places daily to monitor military activity. Song plans to inspect eastern Chahar with Qin Decun in the coming days. After Zhang Renjie's division is transferred to Zhangbei, Chicheng will be taken over by Jia Ziwen's troops. Song appointed Jia as the commander of the Third Brigade and commander of the city defense. The defense of Longmensuo to Longguan will be taken over by a certain division of the Chahar army. The local area is peaceful. (25th Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Yunrong arrived in Peiping on the 25th to report on the situation in eastern Chahar on behalf of Song Zheyuan. Zhang said that the 7th and 8th Japanese divisions are both in eastern Chahar, with the intention of invading Inner Mongolia from the north. (25th Day Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Jin-Chao Road Opens to Chaoyang</p>
<p>(Beiping) The 10th and 14th Japanese divisions stationed in the Northeast have recently been ordered to return to their home country. The Japanese military headquarters will replace them with the Wakayama and Kabumoto divisions. The two divisions have already begun mobilization. (25th Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Chaoyang said that the Japanese army rotates each division every three months, sending them from Japan to the Northeast and then back from the Northeast to Japan. Their locations in the Northeast are also changed from time to time, with the intention of making each division familiar with the local terrain and customs and testing which climate and water and soil are suitable for the life of a certain division. The Jin-Chao Road has opened to Chaoyang, and the foundation for the railway between Chaoyang and Chengde is being built and has now extended from Chaoyangpu to Yebaishou, scheduled to extend to Chengde in June. The Rehe area has been divided by the Japanese into five districts, including Kailu, Chaoyang, Lingyuan, Weichang, and Yebaishou. Each district is stationed with a mixed brigade of puppet troops, about 7,000 men each of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with the puppet brigade commander serving as the district commander. Ji Jinchun, the former Rehe governor, has had his family property confiscated by the Japanese army after surrendering to the puppet state, but it has now been returned. Ji himself is currently the vice minister of the puppet military and political department. (25th Day Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) It has long been rumored that Japanese puppets have been sending Chinese traitors to various places inside the customs to recruit Chinese laborers to be transported outside the customs to train new recruits. It is now known that the number hired in Tianjin is about several thousand. A few days ago, when they were transported from the Tianjin Japanese Concession pier in three ships to Tanggu, they were discovered by our officials, and the customs has successively detained the three ships, and all the Chinese laborers have been dispersed.

<h3 id="e11">The Future of the Pacific Problem Heng <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Since Roosevelt came to power in the United States, he has devoted all his efforts to the domestic economic recovery. His attitude towards the Far East issue has not been clearly expressed. For example, after recognizing Soviet Russia last year, there was a statement that the Pacific Fleet would be transferred to the Atlantic. Recently, after Congress passed the Superior Navy Act of 102 ships, there was another exchange of notes expressing willingness to hold peaceful negotiations with Japan. The attitude of alternating between tension and relaxation is almost elusive. However, its underlying meaning is to adopt a strategy of being able to fight and be able to make peace. If the Pacific problem can be resolved peacefully, it would be the best policy. Otherwise, its navy will still be sufficient to deal with Japan. Judging from the active preparations for war by Soviet Russia, the rapid expansion of the British navy, and the continued construction of the port of Singapore, it can be seen that the war clouds in the Pacific will not completely dissipate until the Pacific problem is resolved. Otherwise, the second world war will break out sooner or later. Therefore, today's US-Japan exchange of notes can be regarded as a major turning point in the international situation since the September 18th Incident. At the same time, due to the needs of the situation, it may promote the early opening of the second Pacific Conference.</p>
<p>Ever since Japan occupied our Northeast and Rehe, the power of various countries in the Pacific has lost its balance. The resolutions of the League of Nations are not enough to curb Japan's ambitions. Stimson's declaration is not enough to shake Japan's will. Although Soviet Russia has repeatedly made tough statements, its intention is only to protect itself. The United Kingdom is trying to maintain composure, and it also needs to strengthen its naval power. Therefore, sanctioning Japan is of no practical use. However, in order to save the situation where the balance has been broken and to convene a Pacific Conference first, it is the best way among no solutions. For example, the Washington Conference of 1922, which many Chinese call the Pacific Conference, included matters related to China, such as the cancellation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the mediation of the Shandong issue, the safeguarding of territorial sovereignty and integrity, and the continuation of the open-door policy, which were all beneficial to us. The distribution of Pacific hegemony included the Four-Power Treaty maintaining the division of Pacific islands by the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and France, and the Naval Treaty stipulating the ratio of capital ships of the navies of the five countries, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy. Therefore, in terms of its achievements, it was a great success of the peace negotiation policy after the war. Now, if it is convened again, it will be able to open up the gloomy situation in the Far East again.</p>
<p>Judging from the content of the US-Japan exchange of notes and the statement of the Japanese military, Japan hopes from the United States for three things: (1) to recognize the puppet state; (2) to have naval parity with the United Kingdom and the United States; and (3) to have the Philippines independent as soon as possible. However, the United States only expressed its willingness to open negotiations. In fact, these issues cannot be resolved solely by the United States and Japan. Granting the first two is true. If Japan rashly demands it, the result may be to make the United States convene a Pacific Conference early and use the power of other countries to suppress Japan. Because the countries related to the Pacific, in addition to China, the United States, and Japan, also include the United Kingdom, Russia, France, the Netherlands, and other countries, which all fear the expansion of Japan's power. Therefore, Japan's demands are difficult to fulfill. Moreover, the puppet state is not allowed to be recognized, which has already been resolved by the League of Nations. It will naturally not be able to break its promise and overturn the case at the next Pacific Conference. As for the equality of naval ratios, it will also be difficult to expect the United Kingdom and the United States to make concessions. Because if the United Kingdom and the United States can make concessions, then the recent efforts to expand the navy would be superfluous. Furthermore, the independence of the Philippines cannot be said to be a problem that can be solved solely by the United States and Japan. Granting the Philippines independence is indeed a consistent policy of the US Democratic Party, but limiting it to complete independence only after twelve years is actually to take precautions while it is not yet independent, so that after its independence, it will not fall into the hands of Japan. Therefore, before this issue is resolved, it may unite with the powerful countries in the Pacific, such as the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands, to jointly guarantee the neutrality of the Philippines, and then make an early abandonment. Other issues, such as maintaining the open-door policy of equal opportunity and equal interests, the agreement on trade and investment in China, and the reallocation of Pacific islands, are also difficult problems in the conference. If the conference can satisfy all parties, the war clouds in the Pacific can be completely dispelled. Otherwise, the competition for armaments between the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and Russia will be even fiercer than today.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our country has not been able to resolve the Northeast problem due to its own lack of solutions. At first, it begged for help from the League of Nations and expected the United States. When it found that it was ineffective, it let it go, as if there was no way to save it. Even when the United States and Japan exchanged notes to make peace, there was no action. In fact, the opportunity to convene a Pacific Conference is gradually becoming ripe. If our country can slightly change the habit of making things happen based on people, it should immediately launch and urge the opening of the Pacific Conference, and then study the plan to recover the Northeast and Rehe, or there will be a day for concrete discussion. Otherwise, if we let the powerful neighbors seek their own convenience and we alone suffer, it will be the most feared.</p>

<p>Filipinos Rejoice Upon Hearing the News</p>
<p>Approval to Form a Republic Within Twelve Years</p>
<p>Philippine Congress Will Undoubtedly Approve Next Month</p>
<p>(Washington) The Philippine Islands Independence Act, proposed by Democratic Senator Tydings and Congressman McDuffie based on President Roosevelt's message, has been passed by both houses of Congress, and the President signed it today, and it immediately became law. When the people of Manila, the capital of the Philippines, heard the news, they were all overjoyed. The church bells and the whistles of various ships echoed each other. The Philippine Congress is scheduled to meet in April to approve the independence law. (Note: The main points of this case are to allow the Philippines to become independent within twelve years, to organize a republic, and after the declaration of independence, the US Army stationed in the Philippines should be withdrawn immediately. As for the naval base, the solution will be discussed two years after independence. (24th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt signed the Tydings-McDuffie Philippine Independence Act today. Those who participated were Secretary of the Army Dern and Senator Tydings, the proposer of the case. Afterwards, President Roosevelt told Philippine Senate President Quezon, "Today is one of our happiest days. The Philippines has invited me to participate in the commemorative ceremony of the Philippine Independence Day, and I am very willing. I can attend on time." The President continued, "The Philippine Congress may be able to accept the original plan without making any changes." Quezon told reporters, "I am very happy because the United States has fulfilled its promise to the Philippines and allowed the Philippines to independently build a republican country. I have expressed my gratitude to the President on behalf of the Filipino people." The Tydings-McDuffie Philippine Independence Act stipulates that the Philippines will become independent within twelve or thirteen years and adopts all the points requested by the current Philippine Independence Petition Group of the United States for revision. The case stipulates that the United States will gradually abandon its naval bases and military storage in the Philippines until the Philippines declares independence. Military storage will be withdrawn completely within this year, and the withdrawal of naval bases will be slower and can be gradually implemented during the preparation period for independence in the Philippines. Regarding the issue of maintaining the US Navy's fuel station in the Philippines, the US government will continue to negotiate with the Philippine authorities. Tydings' proposal is also a part of President Roosevelt's March 2 message to Congress. The US Navy Department has also discussed a plan to abandon various bases in the Philippines.

<p>(Tokyo) Due to the inability of the Minsei Party to agree to jointly propose the National Policy Resolution of the Seiyukai, it was decided on the 25th to submit the proposal to the Diet independently. Mr. Sadao Wakamiya will explain the reasons for the proposal. The main text of the proposal and its statement of reasons are recorded below:</p>
<p>"Main Text" The government's measures for the current situation are insufficient in terms of enriching national defense and internal and external affairs. The government should promptly establish the following national policies and promote their realization: (1) Revitalize diplomacy and establish trade and tariff policies; (2) Establish a policy for economic cooperation between Japan and Manchuria and improve its mechanisms; (3) Provide appropriate assistance and control for industry and finance; (4) Implement reforms in the financial and tax systems; (5) Establish ideological and educational countermeasures. The above five items have been resolved and proposed by this association (Seiyukai).</p>
<p>"Statement of Reasons" After investigating the internal and external situations, there are many matters that require immediate handling. However, the government's facilities are insufficient except for enriching national defense. We urge the government to promptly establish and implement all national policies related to diplomacy, economy, finance, ideology, education, and other facilities. This matter is considered a matter of urgency by this association, so it was unanimously decided to submit this proposal. (Jiji News Agency Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>The U.S. Avoids Interfering in European Affairs</p>
<p>Britain and France Seek Closer Agreement on Security Guarantees</p>
<p>Main Disarmament Committee to Convene as Scheduled Next Month</p>
<p>(Washington) According to administrative authorities here, they believe that France's reply to Britain's disarmament memorandum makes it impossible to implement the principle of world disarmament. They further stated that since the European countries have widely divergent opinions on concessions to Germany and national security, it is feared that there is no hope for substantial disarmament achievements in the near future. President Roosevelt recently expressed his opinion, saying that although the US disarmament representative, Davis, could be sent to Geneva at any time, and perhaps reignite the countries' interest in disarmament, I do not think so. According to senior US Army and Navy officials, the US today is deeply desirous to avoid the disputes of European countries. They also concluded that a truly constructive disarmament is unlikely to be achieved in the next ten years. They are now making remarks against the French note, saying that France insists on the advantages of 1919 and has not made the slightest concession to this day. According to those close to the government, it is believed that France will refuse various proposals to reduce French armaments without a clear security guarantee. As a result, the prospect of realizing world disarmament will inevitably be hindered. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Responsible parties declared that, regarding the security issue, no official documents have been received from the British side here. However, the French ambassador to Britain, Corbin, has notified the British Foreign Office of France's views on this matter, but it is only a conversation and not a real negotiation, because the opinions of both parties are still far apart. The content of the conversation especially focused on the guarantee issue in the implementation of the future disarmament convention. (Havas Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) When the US President criticized France's disarmament reply to Britain, he said that the US maintains the attitude it adopted at the beginning of the disarmament talks, and remains unchanged. That is, to conclude a consultation convention for discussing international issues, the US is willing to participate in it, but if it is forced to use force to resolve any international disputes, the US cannot commit. Recently, responsible parties declared that although the US refuses to participate in sanctions against violations of the disarmament convention, Britain can still reach an agreement with Paris in order to organize a guarantee for the implementation of the future disarmament convention within Europe. If the security guarantee issue in the implementation of the disarmament convention can be resolved, then we will again ask the US to allow, for future sanctions that may occur, not to hinder them in any action. This kind of request is thought to be not easily refused by the US. (Havas Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The French government responded to the British memorandum of January 29 on the disarmament issue with a written reply on March 17. Yesterday, the French government published its content, which advocated that the disarmament issue should always be entrusted to the League of Nations, and recognized Germany's return to the League of Nations as the best guarantee for maintaining world equilibrium. People in the League of Nations warmly welcomed the French reply, and all believed that France has always been loyal to the principles supported by most countries, which is very gratifying. The excitement was evident in their words, and they believed that the presidium's minority committee of the disarmament conference would meet on April 10 as scheduled. With the current situation as it is, important decisions must be taken. The presidium's minority committee will, according to France's proposal, decide to convene the general committee of the disarmament conference to discuss it. (Havas Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>Disarmament Is Empty Talk, Failure Is Predictable</p>
<p>Russia Strives for Practicality, Plays Solo Successfully</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Convention on Defining Aggression has now generally come into effect among the signatory countries. The Soviet government gazette Izvestia commented on it, saying, "One of the important steps taken by the Soviet Union in its continuous struggle to consolidate peace has been completed. Although bourgeois politicians are constantly talking about disarmament and preventing war, they are only empty talk and have achieved nothing. The Soviet Union has demonstrated its practical undertakings by banning one country from aggressing against another." The newspaper continued, "Today, when the bourgeois politicians and newspapers of several countries are openly advocating war, the London Convention is finally taking effect. The disarmament conference has gone bankrupt, and its future meetings are doomed to be fruitless. If the various organs of the conference agree to abandon empty talk that is of no practical help and are willing to do something real, then they should recall this plan for the Convention on Defining Aggression, which was proposed by the Soviet Union and is now adopted by twelve countries, and was also approved in principle by the disarmament conference. As for the Soviet Union's failure to adhere to the implementation of the Geneva resolution and the completion of its plan by adopting the form of an individual convention, it is justified. However, this fact has not reduced the responsibility of the leaders of the disarmament conference for failing to widely adopt this important resolution (i.e., defining non-aggressor countries). On the contrary, this responsibility is further aggravated. The universal effectiveness of the London Convention is sufficient to show how satisfactory the results of similar sincere and resolute struggles conducted by the Soviet Union to consolidate peace are."

<p>French Army Minister's Speech to Reserve Officers</p>
<p>(Paris) French Army reserve officers held a meeting at the University of Paris, chaired by President Lebrun. Army Minister General Petain delivered a speech, saying, "Once a war breaks out, the enemy will surely launch a large-scale attack by surprise. Therefore, the preparation for passive defense is really urgent. This task should be undertaken by public institutions in various provinces, cities, and towns, and should provide useful assistance and encouragement to private actions. From a military point of view, the preparations of neighboring countries are ahead of us. France is lagging behind, and the day to be prepared is still a long way off. Moreover, the position of neighboring countries is not as vulnerable as that of France. For this reason, the situation is even more serious, and the passive defense of various cities is therefore indispensable. Some neighboring countries attach great importance to the training of children's patriotic ideas. They have already received military education before enlisting in the army, and there are important organizations of a military nature outside the formal army. This is what we should emulate. French youth should be made interested in military affairs and have a deep understanding, so that they can take up arms to defend their country when necessary. We will also strive to make reserve officers familiar with the organization and function of the army. It must be known that reserve officers are one of the main keys to the structure of the army."

<h3 id="e25">French Premier's Policy Speech <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Rectify Discipline and Practice Strict Economy</p>
<p>Hope That the People Will Unite Sincerely</p>
<p>Maintain National Prestige and Not Let It Fall</p>
<p>(Paris) Premier Doumergue broadcast a speech at 8:00 PM in the Premier's office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying in brief, "I intend to talk to the people at any time. My appointment to this arduous task is neither due to ambition nor to greed for profit, but to the urging of the President and leaders of various political parties, who all said that if I did not come forward, there would be civil strife. Seeing this situation, I had no choice but to accept the order to form a cabinet. I gathered various parties to organize the cabinet. The fault for the failure of all domestic parties to participate in the cabinet organization does not lie with me. (Referring to the Socialist Party's refusal to participate.) The government's tasks are vast and difficult. If people's hearts are agitated, we should seek their comfort. Those who violate the law should be severely punished, because these people act recklessly, and the state has not brought them to justice, which is the reason for the anger of the people across the country. The people of France are all sound in mind and upright in character. It is right for them to be unhappy with this phenomenon. Now the judicial procedures are underway. If there is evidence of illegal acts, they will be severely dealt with, and no one will be tolerated. If the government wants to do its best, it must first clear the air. Moreover, the government's responsibilities are numerous, certainly not limited to one end. If we want to save the parliamentary system and restore national order and authority, then clearing the air is essential, and it is the top priority. To save the country, we must reform the legal system, change administrative methods, and adjust them. If the national discipline is corrupted, it should be rectified, and a new discipline must be established. The financial position of France must be made strong. The value of the franc has already fallen sufficiently, and it must not be allowed to be affected again. Now every franc is worth one-fifth of the pre-war franc (i.e., 20 centimes). This price should be maintained to preserve the thrifty habits of the French people. If we cannot increase budget revenue by establishing new taxes, then we only have one way: to reduce government spending. Otherwise, the future is unimaginable, and those who do not want to endure painful sacrifices will suffer the most. Now farmers have no way to sell their harvests, and businesses are all suffering from panic. Workers, affected by the economic panic, are either unemployed or have reduced wages, and cannot help the government financially. For the present, the only way is to eliminate abuses, abolish duplicate expenditures, eliminate overly wasteful institutions, and reduce the excessive number of personnel in most institutions. After implementing these measures, we can resolutely follow the example of other countries to reduce other expenditures to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure. Everything I have said comes from a patriotic enthusiasm, with the aim of saving our country's liberal system. I am not greedy for power and benefits. I have nothing to ask for personally. For everything I believe to be true, even if it is unpleasant to the ear, I have no need to conceal it. Saving the country's great cause cannot be done by me alone. Only national unity can achieve this goal. I hope that the people of the country will abandon their opinions and believe that there will be a day of victory in the future, just like what the French soldiers did at the great victory on the Marne River in September 1914. This victory greatly boosted military morale. The final victory in 1918 depended on this. What we should do today is to invigorate our spirit. To restore the financial situation and cope with other difficulties, this is essential. If the people of the country can unite sincerely, the ending will surely be victorious. During the European War, France defeated a strong enemy with its own strength. If this struggle in domestic politics can succeed, then the people of the world will say that France has again used its own strength to bring the country out of fire and water." (Havas Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Premier intends to issue a speech each time the work of political rectification reaches a certain stage to explain it. After this speech, he plans to issue another speech in fifteen days to explain the methods of reducing government spending in detail. The total amount of government expenditure savings has now been determined, but it has not yet been calculated clearly how much each department should reduce. Regarding the national defense budget, Finance Minister Germain-Martin has obtained the consent of Army Minister General Petain, Navy Minister Pietri, and Aviation Minister General Delanne. Today, he also intends to continue to consult with other cabinet members. (Havas Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>The Fascist Party Runs the Show, Drafting Pre-Determined List</p>
<p>Electors Only Need to Say "Yes"</p>
<p>Rome The previous Italian Chamber of Deputies was elected in March 1929. The five-year term has expired, and a re-election is scheduled for the 25th of this month. The new Chamber of Deputies has a total of 400 members, and the list is drafted by the Fascist Party Congress, with Mussolini ranking first. It is then approved by the people, so the election has the nature of a citizen referendum. Whether the new Chamber of Deputies will be abolished in the future and replaced by a professional association parliament will be decided by the new Chamber of Deputies itself. A secret ballot is used during the election. Voters only write "yes" or "no" on the ballot. The voter restrictions are, in terms of age, (1) at least 21 years old, (2) 18 years old, married or widowed; in terms of property, (1) those who pay trade union taxes, (2) those who pay at least 100 lire in taxes annually, (3) those who own property in Italy; in terms of social status, (1) government employees, (2) those who receive state alimony, (3) clergy.

There are many trucks with flags, carrying young Fascist Party members passing through the streets, coming and going endlessly.

<p>Under the Dictatorial System</p>
<p>Democratic Principles Have Not Been Completely Abandoned</p>
<p>Vienna Although Austria's new constitution, based on the spirit of a professional association state, is of an absolute dictatorial nature, democratic principles have not been completely abandoned. The constitution stipulates that any bill rejected by the professional association parliament (legislative assembly) can still be submitted to a citizen referendum for re-voting. There are more events to which citizen referendums apply, but they have not yet been determined. This is one of the characteristics of the new constitution. In addition, there is a special point in the details, namely, the constitution stipulates that "members of the four types of consultation meetings and professional association meetings shall not enjoy the privileges enjoyed by members of the ordinary parliamentary system (i.e., members are not responsible for the speeches they make in the performance of their duties, and cannot be arrested if they break the law without the permission of the parliament)." These privileges are only enjoyed by the President, cabinet members, and provincial government personnel. (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>Road Workers Oppose Current Wage Reduction Methods</p>
<p>(New York) Negotiations to resolve the automobile industry dispute are currently stalled. What the two sides have failed to agree on is the issue of submitting a list of union member names to manufacturers. Manufacturers want to obtain an agreement on this matter, but workers say that manufacturers have not provided them with a guarantee that this list will never be used to advance or retreat workers. Union leaders are now planning to convene a meeting to discuss this matter. At the same time, National Recovery Administration chief Johnson is still working hard to establish an agreement. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) General Johnson of the US National Recovery Administration announced the adjournment of the meeting with automobile industry owners, which had come to a standstill. Today, he announced the adjournment of the meeting, and rumors of a strike by automobile industry workers are still circulating. According to General Johnson, he is still optimistic, and said that his talks with automobile industry owners will continue on Sunday. Railway industry unions refused to accept President Roosevelt's proposed method of "mediating wage disputes between workers and companies." According to union leaders, workers cannot accept any proposal lower than the "1929 wages." Federal Transportation Organizer Eastman is scheduled to continue to discuss everything with railway authorities on Sunday. Automobile industry owners have now agreed to organize an arbitration committee to resolve all issues for both labor parties. Observers now believe that other conditions for withdrawal will be proposed soon. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

New York banks were recently invited to participate in a loan of 100 million guilders to France by the Dutch banking company. Morgenthau, in response to inquiries from New York bankers, informed them that participation would not be permitted.

The loans in question were borrowed by American diplomats between 1915 and 1917. The United States and Turkey severed ties during the Great War, and US-Russian relations were broken off during the Soviet Revolution.

<p>Claiming They Could Lead the US to Communism</p>
<p>Majority Opinion Suggests Underlying Motives</p>
<p>(Washington) Educator Mr. Ward and National Committee Chairman Mr. Lent have attacked President Roosevelt's trusted brain trust, believing they could lead the United States towards communism. This matter will soon become a subject of congressional review. According to Democratic Congressman Mr. Poage, he is preparing to introduce a motion in the House, requesting the House to review the remarks made by Mr. Lent and others attacking the government, as well as their motives. In a letter to Mr. Lent, Mr. Ward stated that, according to a report from a certain advisor to President Roosevelt, the brain trust trusted by President Roosevelt is plotting to overthrow the current system of the American government. Mr. Lent then sent Mr. Ward's letter to the House Committee on Domestic Commerce, stating that since Mr. Ward is a well-known educator, his opinions could not be lightly dismissed. Mr. Ward's letter excerpted the following conversation from a certain advisor to President Roosevelt: "We firmly believe that the President has been caught up in the torrent of the times. The force of the torrent is so great that the President cannot go against it. Before the situation requires a Lenin, we should always support the President. We also firmly believe that the 'Trotsky' of the American Revolution can be none other than the head of state." This report was published yesterday, and although many considered it absurd, the majority opinion in Congress is that there may be serious underlying motives, because Mr. Lent and Mr. Ward are both prominent figures. It is said that the House committee intends to put pressure on Mr. Ward, hoping he will reveal who made this statement. Furthermore, since Mr. Lent is the chairman of the National Committee, he has been very helpful in the administrative reforms. (25th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Lu Muting, Director of the Hebei Finance Department, arrived in Beijing from Tianjin on the 25th to represent Hebei Province at the National Economic Conference. According to him, a total of 23 counties in Hebei Province are war zones and disaster areas. Since the successive recoveries and relief efforts, the province's treasury has suffered a loss of approximately 3 million yuan per year, while private losses are estimated at 80 to 90 million yuan. The amount of unrecorded losses would not be small. Hebei Province's annual statistics show a deficit of approximately 3 million yuan. The province has repeatedly hoped that the central government would provide subsidies. During this trip to Beijing, he will take the opportunity to report to Finance Minister Kong. Furthermore, Hebei Province has not received any subsidies from the central government over the years. The province's financial difficulties are self-evident. Recently, after the recovery of the war zone in eastern Luanhe, the central government allocated 1 million yuan for post-war reconstruction. In addition, the Relief Committee issued 4 million yuan in public bonds. Due to the temporary difficulty in raising cash, they pledged the bond coupons to banks for 2 million yuan, totaling 3 million yuan, which is already being processed. As for Hebei Province's American cotton and wheat loans, the province previously requested the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to allocate a portion for disaster relief, dredging rivers, and building roads. However, it is not yet known whether it has been referred to the Economic Commission for handling. (25th Exclusive Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e86">Banditry in the Border Area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Gradually Suppressed <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Blockhouses Built Everywhere</p>
<p>Military Operations Expected to End</p>
<p>Anqing correspondence: Liu Zhenhua, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Border Area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces and Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, has recently moved to Liu'an to oversee the suppression of remnant bandits in the border area. He returned to the province from Liu'an by plane a few days ago, and yesterday (the 22nd) at 4:00 AM, he took the Jiang'an steamer to Xunyang to visit Chairman Chiang and then went to Hankou to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang to discuss important public matters separately. It is reported that Liu is focusing on bandit suppression in the three-province border area in two zones, east and west. The bandits in the western zone have been nearly completely eliminated. Currently, he is focusing on suppressing the eastern zone. The bandits' nests are mostly in the mountains of the Lihuang County area. Troops have now been mobilized to surround the bandit nests. The main force of the bandits, the bogus 28th Army, attempted to break out with 2,000 men but was defeated by our army. A small part of the bogus Guard Battalion was also routed. The 11th Route Army under Liu Maoen has completely entered the bandit nests and is continuing to search for escaped bandits and pacify the people according to the original bandit suppression plan. They have also ordered the troops stationed in the bandit area to divide the routes and build blockhouses. The blockhouses are being built strategically along the lines from Yejiaji to Shangcheng, Lihuang to Mapu, Lihuang to Nanxi, and Lihuang to Shangcheng. Therefore, blockhouses are being built in (1) places where troops are stationed, (2) highlands and mountains, (3) people's villages, and (4) important transportation routes to facilitate the people's self-defense and save bandit suppression forces. It is expected that once the blockhouses are completed everywhere, the military operations will end. Even though there are still remnant bandits who are wandering around and attacking where defenses are weak, they are only harassing places and are already a spent force and not worth worrying about.

<h3 id="e87">Rare News After the Death of the Dalai Lama (Special Dispatch from Tibet) (Transmitted via India) <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Everything Stated is Essential; May the Government Take Note</p>
<p>A letter from Ti Canjun, a Chinese Buddhist scholar at the Indian International University, states: "This article was sent to me by a friend from Tibet and instructed me to send it to your newspaper to inform the people of our country. The Dalai Lama's will in the article is unknown to the world and is most precious. Please publish it. The text is as follows:"</p>
<p>Since the Dalai Lama's passing, few outsiders, even neighboring countries, know the details. This is because the Tibetan government has always had regulations that require reporting the Dalai Lama's vacancy to the Central Government of the Republic of China first (before the Republic, it was first reported to the Minister of the Interior) before informing the public. Therefore, the reports circulating in foreign newspapers are not accurate. A close friend of mine, who was very close to the Dalai Lama, sent me a letter from Tibet yesterday, instructing me to write and tell the people of our country.</p>
<p>(1) The Date of the Dalai Lama's Demise and His Will</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama passed away last year at the age of 59 on the third day of the fourth month of the Tibetan calendar (corresponding to the fourth day of the fourth month of our country's lunar calendar, only one day apart). When he was about to pass away, all the Shelung Debas of the Batang Monastery and the representatives of the Central Committee's Panchen Lama were in his chamber. Around 4:00 PM, the Dalai Lama, knowing he was about to leave, gave the following instructions to those present:</p>
<p>"You do not listen to my teachings, and I am about to leave. The Panchen Lama, my brother-disciple, has power in the Central Government in Nanjing. You should quickly invite him back to maintain the political and religious order. The monks and people of the front and rear Tibet should listen to the Panchen Lama's teachings. Central peace will save us from suffering. Alas!" (Originally in Tibetan)</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama's words "You do not listen to my teachings" are because there was internal strife among his subordinates for power. At the time when the General Assembly of Monastic Officials Representatives was formed at a certain temple 28 days after the Dalai Lama's passing, it was resolved to punish and imprison Gong Bi (an important aide of the Dalai Lama). His father was also imprisoned, and five of his henchmen were also detained. Gong Bi held important powers in internal affairs and military matters. The Assembly also had several other agenda items, but no results have been achieved, and it is possible that it will cause a major internal strife. In 1933, about 2,000 sons of gentry from front and rear Tibet who were trained by the Dalai Lama were dismissed by Gong Bi, which may have been one of the reasons for the Dalai Lama's illness.</p>
<p>(2) The Escape of Qialong</p>
<p>According to reports, Qialong was a confidant of the Dalai Lama in his early years and held power. The money he extorted from the people was deposited in British colonies. This time, after the Dalai Lama's passing, he suddenly fled to the British military camp in Gyantse, probably fearing that the monastic officials and the people would hate him and it would be detrimental to him, so he fled. Some say that he has other ambitions or may take pro-foreign actions.</p>
<p>(3) The Aftermath of Tibet</p>
<p>On January 28th, the Lhasa authorities, Shelung Xhaba, and representatives of the Central Committee's Panchen Lama sent eight commissioners to the Central Government to urge the Central Committee's Panchen Lama to return to Tibet. The Panchen Lama's return to Tibet is not only welcomed by the monastic and official circles, but also by the people of the front and rear Tibet. It is also to respect the Dalai Lama's will. From the perspective of religious belief, the Dalai Buddha is the incarnation of Avalokiteśvara, and the Panchen Buddha is the incarnation of Amitabha. The Dalai Lama is also the incarnation of Princess Wencheng, and Princess Wencheng is the manifestation of Avalokiteśvara. All Tibetan culture, religion, and etiquette, from the Tang Dynasty to the Republic, are due to Princess Wencheng's love for the country, the people, and the race. The Panchen Buddha is the incarnation of Amitabha, and Avalokiteśvara is the messenger of Amitabha. Although this statement is religious superstition, I cannot but follow the customs of the people. People pray morning and night, scatter flowers, offer incense, and respectfully call the names of the two holy monks, Panchen and Dalai. The faith is unified, and the national will is also one. The Dalai Lama's death caused sadness to all the Tibetan people, and women do not wear clothes with red and green colors. Regarding the return of the Central Committee's Panchen Lama to Tibet, all the Tibetan people are overjoyed. Even under heavy economic pressure, they do not feel much pain.</p>
<p>(4) Tibet's Construction and Economy</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Tibet's construction, according to Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, it is probably a vain idea to talk about Tibet's construction before the completion of the Lhasa-Xinjiang and Yunnan railway plans. This is also related to the economic problem. Therefore, the slow progress of Tibet's construction is a major reason before the Central Government's economic power can spread to the entire area. Tibet is close to powerful neighbors. Those powerful neighbors rely on their convenient transportation and stable economy. If they take action, Tibet will inevitably be controlled by them. Since 1933, the economic power of the British colonies has attacked Tibet more and more deeply every day. Therefore, the suffering of the Tibetan people is also increasing day by day. The return of the Central Committee's Panchen Lama to Tibet is indeed desired by the people, the monastic community, and the officials, and they have repeatedly urged him by telegram. However, the old animosity between the Dalai Lama's and Panchen Lama's disciples and gentry may not be resolved by the Central Government's remote instructions. The Central Government must send a capable and knowledgeable high official to Tibet to take charge, or change the province to a committee system before there can be no worries. In addition, there is the issue of education. Tibetan education, both the educators and the educated, feel that it is lacking. In both men's and women's societies, the customs are still ancient, not even as advanced as India's medieval society today. Religion is the opium of the people. I sincerely believe it. If it is believed too much, it will poison my descendants for ten thousand years. Tibet is an example. Women in polyandrous, patriarchal families have intercourse in front of the Buddha statues day and night. They do not consider it dirty but say that men and women reveal wisdom, or that determination and wisdom are in harmony, or that the mind and nature are in harmony. Tibet is our compatriot. The Central Government should treat them equally, enlighten the Tibetan people's knowledge, and for the education of Tibet, it should establish several primary schools. In the universities of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, there should be free Tibetan students to promote the development of their education, because Yunnan and Sichuan provinces are adjacent to the Tibetan areas, and communication is more convenient, and the people are more likely to get closer. Or plan several mountainous areas, sincerely run rural areas, and move people to settle and defend the borders, which is also necessary. In short, it still depends on the Central Government and the local transportation and economic facilities' power to spread. (Sent from the Indian International University on March 1, 1934)</p>

<h3 id="e88">Tokyo's View of the Japanese-Soviet War (Japanese Correspondence) <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Japan Dares Not Challenge Externally</p>
<p>Soviet Union Eager to Strengthen Construction</p>
<p>The relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union has gradually become tense since Northern Manchuria was occupied by the Japanese army. Many middle-level cadres in Japan do advocate taking advantage of the situation to attack and conquer Siberia. However, it was not implemented. The reasons are: (1) The Northeast Volunteer Army rose up everywhere. Although it was not enough to cause the Japanese army's death, it was enough to contain its entire military plan. It initially thought that the Volunteer Army was no more than bandits and was not worth attacking. As a result, some were as he expected, and many were beyond his expectations. Therefore, his invasion of Siberia plan had to be temporarily suspended. (2) Incidents continued to occur in Japan. One was the conflict between the military and the financial groups, which became increasingly acute. The symbol of internal disunity has become a concrete fact. The Japanese warlords have knowledge of this point, so they want to seek internal unity first. The Communist Party's movement has spread to all classes. In the aristocratic school Gakushuin, fifty or sixty people have been radicalized. There is a more serious impact on the army. Therefore, the Japanese clique was cautious and cautious at that time and finally limited itself to active preparation.</p>
<p>Recently, two extremely serious facts have occurred, one is military, and the other is general political. The military matter is that Soviet planes often go to the Soviet-Korean border and the area along the Ussuri River to conduct military inspections. Recently, one fell in Mishan and was captured by the puppet army. If Japanese planes fly over the border or near the border, the Soviet army immediately opens fire with anti-aircraft machine guns. Politically, Soviet officials, such as Stalin, Molotov, and Voroshilov, etc., have all made the most sharp and powerful anti-Japanese speeches.</p>
<p>According to common sense, this is unacceptable to the Japanese warlords. Even if the upper-level people can barely suppress their anger, the middle-level cadres are not willing to give in easily. However, until now, no major changes have occurred, and there is a tendency to continue to endure. However, endurance is only temporary and has a certain limit. After this period, after this certain limit, it is difficult to guarantee that disasters will not occur. Moreover, Japan is actively preparing. It has transferred the 10th Division and the 74th Division stationed along the Middle East Railway back to the country, and the 3rd Division from Nagoya and the 16th Division from Kyoto have gone to fill the defenses. On the surface, it seems to be just a troop rotation, with no major relationship. However, it contains extremely important facts, because the 3rd Division of Nagoya is one of the four major divisions of Japan. In addition to the 4th Cavalry Brigade originally on the Middle East Railway line, there are also two infantry brigades and one field heavy artillery brigade. This brigade has two field heavy artillery regiments, one field artillery regiment, one anti-aircraft artillery regiment, and three aircraft regiments (with a total of about 300 aircraft). The 16th Division, although not as large as the 3rd Division, also has one more aircraft regiment and one heavy artillery battalion than the ordinary division. From this, it can be seen that Japan is also actively preparing. Even if it does not take the offensive, it intends to respond to the war.</p>
<p>However, judging from Japan's current situation, it still adopts more conservative components and fewer aggressive components. First, Japan's military preparation, according to Japanese experts, the strength of the Japanese army and the Soviet army, both believe that the Japanese army has not yet had full confidence, because Japan only has two tank regiments, a total of 1,600 land and sea aircraft, only 150 civil aircraft, plus military auxiliary aircraft, the maximum is only 3,000 aircraft, while the Soviet side, according to Japanese reconnaissance reports, said that there are 6,000 aircraft, and dozens of super-bombers. If Japan cannot seize the Vladivostok airfield within a few hours after the start of the war, then Tokyo and Osaka are in danger of being bombed. Second, the so-called Japanese-Manchurian economic alliance has not yet been completed. The railway network in the three northeastern provinces has not been built, and heavy industry cannot have practical construction. At the same time, Japan's diplomatic relations with capitalist countries have not yet been resolved satisfactorily. He is concerned about the state of international isolation. It is possible to actively challenge only after opening up international difficulties. The current Japan is engaged in these events. What Hirota calls morality contains a very strong gunpowder smell.

<h3 id="e89">A Record of Things Seen and Heard in Ban Hong <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>An Investigation Report by Zhao Yunyan</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The dispute over the Yunnan-Burma border has not yet ended, and the British have invaded the Ban Hong mining area. Yunnanese in Beijing have petitioned the Central Government to negotiate with the British, demarcate the border and erect markers, and strengthen the border defense to consolidate the territory. The 3rd Army stationed in Xuzhou, mostly from Yunnan, pays special attention to this. Army officer Zhao Yunyan was specially dispatched by the Yunnan Provincial Government to southern Yunnan in 1926 to conduct on-the-ground investigations of the national border. He has detailed knowledge of the land and customs of the Ban Hong area. He specially reported the Ban Hong situation and all kinds of relations to Wang Jun, Commander of the 3rd Army, and Zeng Wanzhong, Commander of the 7th Division, requesting their assistance in Yunnan to carry out everything. The report from Zhao is recorded as follows: Zhao Yunyan went to the Ban Hong area in 1926 to conduct an on-the-ground investigation and witnessed the British aggression. He was deeply hateful. He recorded what he saw and heard every day. In May 1931, when the Central Government convened the National Assembly, Zhao went to Beijing from Xuzhou and submitted the entire case to the Yunnan representatives, suggesting that the Central Government implement the reorganization. However, southern Yunnan is thousands of miles away, with dangerous mountains and rivers, and inconvenient transportation. It is mostly regarded as an uncivilized region, and few pay attention to it. In 1931, the September 18th Incident occurred, and the three northeastern provinces fell one after another. Britain and France took the opportunity to invade our borders. He also included his opinions and illustrations on the military magazine, issue forty-fifth, page one hundred forty-one, and marked the mining field with a ▲ symbol, as a reference for those who are concerned about border defense, and to let the people of the whole country understand that the importance of the southwest is not less than the northeast. Since this year, the British have indeed invaded and occupied the mining area. The local people refused to be trampled on and gathered to resist. The Yunnanese cried out loudly and sent letters and telegrams everywhere. The Yunnanese compatriots in Beijing held an emergency meeting and asked the national government to file a negotiation. However, the importance of the southwest and the rich production of minerals, animals, and plants may not be well known to the people of the country. Now, I will briefly describe its geological, mineral, climatic, political, and economic conditions. (1) Geology, originally composed of gneiss granite and big mountains, so the metallic minerals and jadeite amber are extremely rich in storage. Although it is a plateau, there are still rivers to regulate, and there are natural hot springs. It originally belonged to the Gaoligong Mountains and is located between the Nujiang River and the Irrawaddy River, shaped like a gourd, so it is named Huluwangdi. There are five small tribes in it. (2) Climate, the average temperature is around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest is no more than 100 degrees, and the lowest is no less than 50 degrees. However, there is a lot of smoky miasma in summer and autumn, and spring and winter are the most peaceful. (3) Area, more than 900 li wide from east to west and more than 2,000 li long from north to south, with a population of about 23,000 households, totaling about 130,000 people. Han and Hui account for two-thirds, Baiyi account for three-tenths, [unreadable characters] account for five-tenths. (4) Politics, it is completely an ancient tribal system. In addition to the five small king tribes, there are also fourteen chieftains, with varying sizes of territories. The food and clothing are simple, and both men and women are strong. The Baiyi girls are mostly beautiful, like people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but the [unreadable character] faces are slightly darker, and few are handsome. (5) Products, the plants include Bupleurum, camellia, large bamboo, soft rattan, and Catalpa, chestnut, Toona sinensis, willow, locust, mulberry, oak, elm, pine, cypress, maple, fir, and trees that form forests. As for flowers, fruits, and medicinal materials, it is impossible to list them all. Rice is planted twice a year, with occasional corn, [unreadable character], millet, potatoes, cotton, flax, etc. The animals include cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, bears, tigers, elephants, leopards, deer, rabbits, [unreadable character], and domestic fowl such as chickens and dogs. (6) Economy, the local people's furniture and utensils are quite strange, such as the bow shovel, moon axe, wooden spoon, and bamboo grab in agricultural implements, the repeating crossbow and fire gun in weapons, and the rattan bed, rattan basket, bamboo cart, bamboo cabinet, bamboo bowl, and bamboo basin in utensils are all exquisite. It is a market during the day, trading with ancient copper coins from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, as well as silver ingots and placer gold. There is also homemade cloth, but in the past twenty years, foreign thread and foreign cloth have been mostly imported from Burma. I am afraid that after ten years, it will be a foreign goods market. (7) Transportation, the roads are blocked, postal and telegraph services are lacking, and merchants travel in groups. Ordinary one or two travelers cannot easily go deep. Even we Yunnanese know very little about its contents. It is about 2,000 li from Kunming to Ban Hong, which takes a month's journey. (8) Culture, there is no new education, mostly old-fashioned private schools, corrupt and unbearable, and very few literate people. The local people still give ropes and wooden carvings to record events. Two years before the Republic of China, Long Qingguang approved the Qing government to establish a civil school. Since its establishment, compulsory education has been implemented. The children of the Yi people who are unwilling to study ask the Han people to replace them, which is quite interesting. (9) Religion, believing in gods and Buddhas, especially worshiping Zhuge Kongming. If men and women, old and young, have any discomfort, they must worship Kongming, or those who seek blessings and children ask people to paint Kongming's statue or carve a wooden statue and worship it day and night, just like women in the country worship Guanyin. (10) Salt, this issue is especially heartbreaking. According to the former Sino-British Yunnan-Burma Treaty, "Yunnan wine cannot be transported to Burma, and Burmese sea salt is not allowed to be sold to China. Those who violate this treaty shall have all wine and salt and accompanying goods confiscated, and the person shall be sentenced to indefinite imprisonment." Unexpectedly, the taxes on salt fields in southwestern Yunnan are too heavy, and the transfer is difficult, so that the local people along the border eat sea salt. The Yunnan salt administration has been greatly affected. Even the counties of Shengchong, Yongchang, Longling, Zhenkang, and Mianning mostly eat sea salt. If two or three brigades of national defense forces can be established, one side will reclaim and colonize the border, and the other side will strictly arrest sea salt. If it can be stopped, about 200,000 dan of domestic salt can be sold every month. If one yuan is charged per dan, the increased salt tax can be used to support these two or three brigades of national defense forces, which is more than enough. The above is just a superficial statement. I hope that the Central Government and the people of the whole country will unite in accordance with the Prime Minister's principles of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood, adopt effective methods, stop the British invasion, and prevent the southwest from becoming a continuation of the northeast, so that the border will be permanently consolidated, which is not only fortunate for Yunnan but also fortunate for the whole country. Zhao Yunyan stated in Xuzhou Military Headquarters. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Dutch Administration's Strict Restrictions on Immigration <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>丨丨 Its purpose is to restrict Chinese people 丨丨</p>
<p>Batavia Correspondence: The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies submitted a revised and supplemented draft of the Dutch East Indies Immigration Act (i.e., the Immigration Restriction Act) to the People's Council on September 7th of last year. This new regulation was scheduled to take effect on January 1st of this year. On October 24th of last year, the All Dutch East Indies Chinese Chamber of Commerce jointly petitioned the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies to revise this new regulation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the motherland government also instructed the ambassador to the Netherlands to request consultations. Now that this new regulation has been implemented, hopes for revision are dashed. Therefore, starting this year, immigration to the Dutch East Indies has been restricted. The principles of restriction are as follows: (1) The government will issue orders each year specifying the following two items: (A) the total number of immigrants allowed entry; (B) the number of entries allowed for each nationality. (2) The numbers in item (B) above are treated equally for all nationalities. (3) If, in any year, the number of immigrants allowed entry is lower than the limit in item (A) of article one (i.e., lower than the total number of immigrants allowed entry), then the number of entries for each nationality, according to item (B) of article one, may be increased. The increase shall not exceed one-tenth of the total number of foreigners of that nationality who entered the Dutch East Indies in the ten consecutive years prior to the implementation of the new regulation. (4) In any year, once the limit stipulated in item (A) of article one is reached, only foreigners of those nationalities whose immigration quota has not reached the limit will be allowed entry, until the maximum quota under item (A) of article one is reached. (5) The areas of Danker, Pinang, Lingga, and part of the Riau Islands and Karimun archipelago are not subject to the provisions of this regulation. All of the above principles were submitted by the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Mr. de Jonge, to the People's Council for approval. According to the Batavia Nieuwsblad, translated from the government gazette, the reasons for this are: "Although the number of foreigners entering the country in the last ten years has varied from year to year, there has been a definite upward trend. In recent years, due to the economic downturn, the numbers have decreased slightly, but it is expected that they will increase again in due course, as in 1924. This trend of increasing immigration cannot be passively stopped. Of course, there are still places in the Dutch East Indies where law-abiding people can live, enabling them to support themselves and contribute to the prosperity of the Dutch East Indies. However, it is very difficult for the indigenous people to establish themselves in industry and commerce other than agriculture. If too many immigrants enter, it will hinder the indigenous people. Therefore, it is necessary to stipulate limits on foreign immigration in a timely manner to prevent future waves of immigration." From this, it can be seen that this new regulation is to prevent future waves of immigration and protect the indigenous people. This is certainly reasonable. However, observing the immigration statistics from 1925 to 1930 and studying the essence of this new regulation, it is entirely to restrict the entry of Chinese people. Now, the immigration statistics table from 1925 to 1930 is copied as follows:</p>
<p>Immigrant Count Chinese Immigrant Count Percentage Other Nationalities Immigrant Count</p>
<p>1925 32,273 24,278 75% 7,995</p>
<p>1926 45,566 36,404 80% 9,162</p>
<p>1927 50,965 39,810 78% 11,145</p>
<p>1928 52,923 41,157 80% 11,765</p>
<p>1929 48,386 35,946 75% 12,440</p>
<p>1930 41,985 32,181 78% 9,804</p>
<p>The government has already stipulated that the total number of immigrants allowed entry this year is 12,000 (Batavia News reported a message from the Bogor government office on December 15th), divided into fifteen groups, with 800 people in each group. According to Consul-General Song of Batavia, in a meeting with the Director of Immigration on December 19th of last year, the director explained, roughly saying, "The government's stipulation that the total number of immigrants for 1934 is 12,000 was made after much deliberation. The 12,000 people are distributed among fifteen nationalities, with 800 people for each nationality. However, according to the provisions of the new regulations, there is considerable elasticity. When each nationality reaches its quota, but other nationalities have not yet reached their quota, it can be increased to one-tenth of the total number of that nationality over the past ten years. The number of Chinese entrants each year is the largest. Some other nationalities only have 800 people, and some do not even have half that number. Therefore, the new regulations are not enough to affect Chinese immigrants. In 1931, there were more than 5,000 Chinese entrants. In 1933, there were only about 5,000 people, and the total number of immigrants of other nationalities was only about 3,000 people. Now that the total number is 12,000, Chinese immigrants can account for 8,000 people." Looking at this, it is comforting. However, looking at the aforementioned statistics, the average annual entry of Chinese people is more than 34,000, and the average annual entry of various nationalities is 8,400. If divided by fourteen groups on average, then each nationality has 600 people. Even if the 200 people who have not reached the quota are multiplied by fourteen, the total number of Chinese entrants is only 2,800 people. Adding 800 people per nationality, it is only 3,600 people. The so-called 8,000 people is just deception. Now, the details of the immigration regulations are copied below so that Chinese people going to the Dutch East Indies will not be hindered by the government.</p>
<p>(1) New provisions of the new immigration regulations (A) The wives and children of new immigrants are restricted; (B) The wives and children of those who hold a "Wang" character (citizenship document) are not restricted.</p>
<p>(2) Procedures for ordinary new immigrants upon entry (A) Ports authorized for foreign nationals to enter: (Java) Batavia Tanjung Priok Seaport, Semarang Seaport, Surabaya Tanjung Perak Seaport, (Celebes) Makassar, Manado, (Sumatra) Belawan, Sabang, Langsa, Pangkalan Brandan, Tanjungpura, Sungai Gerong, Jambi, Palembang, Padang, Bengkalis Seaport, Sibolga Panjang, (Borneo) Pontianak, Singkawang, Banjarmasin, Balikpapan, Tarakan, (Bangka Island) Muntok, Pangkal Pinang, (Belitung Island) Tanjung Pandan, (B) Classification of "Teng Po" certificates: Foreign nationals of all nationalities receive "Teng Po" certificates upon landing. These "Teng Po" certificates are divided into two types: one is a temporary "Teng Po" certificate with a term of six months (white), and the other is a long-term "Teng Po" certificate (yellow). A temporary "Teng Po" certificate is also known as a travel permit. If you leave the country within six months after receiving a temporary "Teng Po" certificate, the immigration tax of 150 Dutch guilders paid can be refunded. Those who want to reside for a long time must go to the Immigration Office to exchange for a long-term "Teng Po" certificate on the day when the six-month period is about to expire. If it is not exchanged after the expiration date, it will be regarded as waste paper. When applying for a long-term "Teng Po" certificate again, another immigration tax of 150 Dutch guilders must be paid.</p>
<p>(3) Validity of long-term "Teng Po" certificates: Long-term "Teng Po" certificates are valid for two years. Those who wish to continue their stay after the expiration date can ask the local magistrate to extend it for one year. The second time, you can apply for another extension, for a period of six years, for a total period of ten years. After ten years, you can obtain a "Wang" character, that is, a permanent residence permit.</p>
<p>(4) Procedures for guaranteeing immigrants' entry: When immigrants enter the country, they must be guaranteed by relatives or employers. Therefore, when the ship docks, the harbor affairs officer will immediately call the roll and pass the papers. When paying the immigration tax, they will report the name of the guarantor, shop, or organization, and then land and go to the port immigration office. At this time, the guarantor can enter to guarantee. The guarantor must personally hand over their residence certificate and tax bill to the Immigration Office for inspection. If the guarantor is ill or unable to go in person for some reason, they can entrust a qualified taxpayer to collect it on their behalf. However, the original guarantor must write a certificate and hand over their residence certificate and tax bill to the trustee for inspection by the Immigration Office. After being found qualified, a photo will be affixed and a "Teng Po" certificate will be issued. However, you can also ask them to go to the Immigration Office to collect it the next day.</p>
<p>(5) Qualifications of guarantors: The qualifications of guarantors are based on the annual income tax as the standard, regardless of occupation. It is stipulated that those who pay a tax of 15 guilders can guarantee one person, those who pay a tax of 20 guilders can guarantee two people, those who pay a tax of 30 guilders can guarantee three people, those who pay a tax of 45 guilders can guarantee four people, those who pay a tax of 55 guilders can guarantee five people, those who pay a tax of 65 guilders can guarantee six people, and those who pay a tax of 75 guilders can guarantee seven people.

<h3 id="e91">He Long Invades Dayong and Retreats <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Also flees to Hefeng, Hubei</p>
<p>Chen Quzhen Telegraphs He Jian to Report Victory</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Chen Quzhen, commander of the newly编 第三十四师 (New 34th Division), who has been stationed in western Hunan for more than ten years, transferred the brigades of Li Keda, Zhou Xieqing, and Gong Renjie to eastern Guizhou last winter due to interference in the Guizhou provincial war. He helped the Guizhou East Allied Forces, led by Che Mingyi, Lei Mingjiu, and Yang Qichang, to fight against Wang Jialie's troops. The area around Yongbao Longsang in western Hunan became empty. He Long, who has always been expanding in the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan border area, took the opportunity to invade Huichang and divided Yongshun Dayong and other areas, with a great momentum of 進九. Chen Quzhen was therefore in danger and urgently reached a compromise with Wang Jialie, withdrawing all the 保旗 that had entered Guizhou to 南, and drove He Long. The war in eastern Guizhou was thus peacefully resolved. After Commander Chen returned to Hunan, 周 and 两旗 were responsible for advancing to suppress the bandits of He Long. In more than a month, there were more than a dozen battles, large and small. In addition to recovering the county seat of Sangzhi, the bandits who invaded Dayong were defeated. He Long's bandits failed in their attack on Dayong and are now fleeing towards Hefeng, Hubei. According to Chen Quzhen's telegram reporting the victory, the original telegram read: "He's bandits attacked Yong. Zhen's Gong Detachment Commander (Renjie) advanced to suppress them towards Jingziya. The bandits were unable to resist and fled towards Zhonghu. They were pursued to the vicinity of Zhonghu. The bandits stubbornly resisted, holding on until 1:00 pm on the Wen day, refusing to retreat. Our officers and soldiers bravely charged and engaged in hand-to-hand combat more than a dozen times. The bandits suffered too many casualties and fled northward. It is estimated that more than a dozen company and platoon leaders and more than 200 bandits were killed in this battle, and more than 30 bandits were captured. Our army also suffered more than 40 casualties. The majority of the bandits, about 3,000 people, fled to the Hubei border from Shijia Yang. We are continuing to pursue and suppress them. Your subordinate, Chen Quzhen, respectfully reports." Zhou Ren, the magistrate of Dayong County, also telegraphed a report: (1) The original telegram read: "Gong and Zhou brigade commanders recovered Sangzhi City on the Jia day. Regiment Commander Zhu Jikai set off from Guanyin Township in the subordinate county on the Zheng day to guard against bandits in the Ci 利江亞 area. According to reports, He's bandits are entrenched in Xijing Township in the county. Brigade Commander Gong led Zhang Jinwu and Tian Shaoqing's regiments and stationed at Shuitapo to intercept them. On the Zheng day, Brigade Commander Zhou sent Regiment Commander Yang to station at the Yong border Kongkeshu to cut off the bandits' retreat. Zhen personally led Regiment Commander Geng to pursue and suppress them along Xipo. When they arrived at Jingziya, the bandits fled to Zhonghu. Brigade Commander Zhou led his troops to chase to Zhonghu. The bandits stubbornly resisted and fought fiercely for half a day. The bandits were unable to resist and retreated to the Kangtun Township, Shilong, and Mihu areas of the subordinate county. On the Yuan day morning, they tracked and suppressed them again. According to captured bandits, He Long himself came to Jingziya in Dayong and was colluding with local bandits. The Red bandits' fake Seventh and Ninth divisions and He Long's guard battalion had about 2,700 rifles and about 3,000 people. However, they are very short of bullets, and the bandits are very reluctant to be bandits for a long time. This shows that the bandit situation is desperate and already showing signs of disintegration." (2) The Han telegram read: "After He Long's bandits were severely attacked by Brigade Commander Zhou Xieqing and intercepted by Brigade Commander Gong Renjie, the remnants fled towards Guandiping in Cili, apparently trying to go to the border of Hefeng in Hubei. Our Brigade Commander Zhou is tracking and suppressing them. Thinking back to the past half month, He Long's bandits invaded with all their forces, and my Yong City was in extreme danger. With the help of Chief of Staff Bian Mengying, Regiment Commanders He Hancheng and Wang Shangzhi, and the commanders of the subordinate county's security battalions, and all the officers and soldiers, they defended the city with all their might, and the bandits were unable to succeed. As an official with the responsibility of guarding the land, I maintained calmness and mobilized the militia to assist in military defense and suppression work. In the past ten days, I have not been able to sleep or eat in peace. Relying on your authority, I was able to turn danger into safety. I respectfully report." (March 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Jiangnan Company Plans to Build Railways in the Five Southeastern Provinces <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>- Starting from Nanjing and ending at the Fujian-Guangdong border -</p>
<p>- The Nanjing-Wuhu Line is scheduled to be completed this year -</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The southeastern provinces are mountainous and have only rivers and sand rivers for transportation, with rafts coming and going. The transportation of goods is extremely difficult, and there are many barriers to communication in language and culture. Zhang Jingjiang of the Jiangnan Railway Company presented a request to the Ministry of Railways to build the Nanjing-Zhaoan Railway, starting from Nanjing and ending at Zhaoan on the border of Fujian and Guangdong. The entire line is 1,200 kilometers long, passing through the five provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Guangdong, and crossing important mountain ranges such as Huangshan and Tiantai. After the completion of the project and the opening of the railway, it will be of great importance to the commercial, cultural, social, and economic development of the five provinces, and its benefits will be several times greater than those of the Wuhu-Zha Line, which is currently under construction. The estimated construction cost is 30 million yuan. The project has been fully planned by Hong Shen, the chief engineer of the Wuhu-Zha Line of the company. The entire line is pre-divided into five sections for construction, each with a separate construction period. The first section is the Nanjing-Wuhu Line, the second section is the Wuhu-Sun Line (Wuhu to Sunjiabu in Xuancheng), the third section is the Sun-Jiang Line (Sunjiabu to Jiangshan in Zhejiang), the fourth section is the Jiang-Yan Line (Jiangshan to Yanping in Fujian), and the fifth section is the Yan-Zhao Line (Yanping to Zhaoan). It is also planned that after the completion of the railway to Zhaoan, it will be extended to Guangzhou to realize the grand plan of transportation in the five southeastern provinces. The second section of the project originally belonged to the Wuhu-Zha Line and will soon be completed. The section from Wuhu to Zhusigang has already been opened to traffic. The first section of the Nanjing-Wuhu Line has too many bends in the existing Nanjing-Wuhu Highway roadbed and is currently being leased by merchants for five years to operate long-distance passenger and freight transport, so it is not suitable for reconstruction. Therefore, a new route has been surveyed. The area between Nanjing and Wuhu is all flat and close to the Yangtze River, making construction very easy. Only the Dangtu River is planned to be connected by a three-hole iron bridge. It is planned to be completed within this year. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Tianjin Agricultural and Industrial Bank Robbed <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Five or six robbers broke in during the day</p>
<p>Robbed about 50,000 yuan in cash</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm, five or six bandits broke into the Chinese Agricultural and Industrial Bank on Zhongjie in the French Concession and robbed about 50,000 yuan in banknotes before escaping. The details of the robbery of the bank are recorded as follows: The bank's business hours are from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm and from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm, all the staff members of the business office had arrived, but the original guard policeman had not yet taken up his post. The servant opened the door to prepare to start business. A person from the Bank of China who was delivering money was waiting outside the door. As soon as the door opened, he entered the cashier counter to hand over more than 20,000 yuan in allocated banknotes. There were still more than 10,000 yuan in banknotes in his money bag, ready to be delivered to the Kenye Bank after clearing the Agricultural and Industrial Bank's money. At that moment, three more people broke in. One of them was carrying a cloth bag and placed it on the counter. The bank staff thought it was a person who came to exchange money, so they stood up to greet him. The person opened the cloth bag, which contained a handgun. The person struck the staff member's head with the butt of the gun, then jumped over the counter. Another bandit also went around the counter, leaving one bandit outside to keep watch. The three bandits each held a handgun. One of the bandits inside the counter was wearing a long blue cloth gown and a cyan vest, and the other bandit inside the counter was wearing short blue clothes. The appearance of the bandit outside the counter was not clearly seen. The language they spoke was not clear, whether it was southern dialect or Japanese. The two bandits in the counter punched the bank's staff members, signaling them to lie down on the ground. Everyone was frightened and lay down, not daring to make a sound. While everyone was lying down, they faintly heard two or three more people entering to patrol the counter. At that time, the night watchman Yuan Zhen happened to hear the noise in the business office in the backyard. He hurriedly came to see what was happening and was punched to the ground by the bandit. When the bandit turned around, Yuan Zhen quickly returned to the backyard and told the tea servant at the guardhouse to report the case to the Public Works Bureau. The two bandits in the counter punched all the staff members and made them lie down, then rushed to the cashier's desk, first seizing the money bag sent by the Bank of China, and then searching the drawers of the desk and the banknotes on the desk. In a hurry, they did not manage to search all the banknotes before hearing a voice saying, "Let's go!" The bandit in the counter bundled the banknotes in a blue cloth bag and handed them to the bandit outside the counter who was keeping watch. The bandits were about to flee when Xie Fuchen, the accounting director of the bank, walked in from outside the door. Because he was late for work, he did not know that an accident had occurred. When the bandits saw someone coming in, fearing an accident, one of the bandits fired a shot at the ceiling. Fortunately, no one was injured. Then they went out the door and went north. According to witnesses outside the door, the bandits did not have a car. They only saw them hiding the package in their clothes and leaving together. The bandits were only there for about fifteen minutes. The French Public Works Bureau received a report from the bank's tea servant and sent many police officers to surround the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. By that time, the bandits had already fled far away and were not captured. After the incident, the bank investigated the losses. More than 10,000 yuan in banknotes were robbed, and the money bag of the Bank of China was robbed, totaling more than 30,000 yuan. The total loss was more than 50,000 yuan. The bullet fired by the bandit pierced a hole in the door of the business office. It is not known where the shell landed. The French Public Works Bureau took the bandits' fingerprints and took the Bank of China's money deliverer to the bureau to study clues. The bank also sent someone to the bureau to ask questions and at the same time investigate the escaped bandits. They also telegraphed the Chinese Concession authorities to ask for their attention and cooperation in the arrest. (23rd)</p>

<p>Shun Kang Money Exchange in Zhongshi, Xizhongmen, has a warehouse in Zaoshi Street, Xumenwai, and its business is quite prosperous. Because the roads in Zaoshi Street, Xiatang, are rugged and uneven, Shun Kang hired contractors to repair them. This project was contracted to a small foreman named Yang Huifu.

<h3 id="e98">Interview with Li Shuyun <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhuomin, the former director of the Second Public Security Bureau of this county, refused to hand over his position, obstructing official duties. The case involved Li Shuyun, the wife of Gu Renfa, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, who was suspected of conspiracy. It was also said that Li was engaging in fraud, soliciting money, selling official positions, and selling titles. The Jiangsu Provincial Government sent personnel to Shanghai to arrest Li and her daughter and escort them to the county court of this county for interrogation and detention, etc. This has been reported in this newspaper many times. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Li Shuyun in the court. Shuyun was wearing a silk cheongsam, each lined with a velvet cheongsam, covered with a blue jacket made of Shilin cloth. Her hair was styled in waves, and she was calm. According to her, she is 22 years old, from Changsha, Hunan, and comes from a distinguished family. She studied in Beijing and Hankou in her early years and graduated from the Zundao Church School in Hankou. Her father's name is Li Zhengcheng, and he is currently the cashier of the Hunan Provincial Bank. She has an 18-year-old younger brother who is studying at the May 30th Middle School in Nanjing. He has now transferred to Beijing. Shuyun met Director Gu when she was 19 years old. At that time, Director Gu was a counselor in the General Headquarters of the Xingying. Once, when watching a play, Gu met and was greatly impressed by 余. He asked Li Wengong (the current Director of the Public Security Bureau of this county), the adjutant of the headquarters, to intercede. Li Wengong's wife, Jin Xiufu, acted as matchmaker. On June 22nd, 1920, 余 and Director Gu officially married in the Central Hotel in Hankou. Li Wengong was the marriage witness, and Ren Hebin was the officiant.

<p>Yang, the concubine of Guo Ziqing, a former member of the Anhui Provincial Government, was 23 years old and from Sanhe County, Hebei. She had been with Guo for several years, and their family life was considered harmonious. Yang was also quite virtuous. Unexpectedly, Yang suddenly swallowed a large amount of opium in her residence in Youfang Lane the other day. After Guo discovered this, he called for a doctor to administer an enema to save her, but it was too late, and she died. She was then placed in a coffin and sent to a temporary burial site three miles east of the city. However, a neighbor named Lou Yeru claimed that Yang had been abused and beaten to death by her family. He filed a lawsuit with the court, seeking justice for Yang. The court accepted the case and summoned both parties for questioning on the 19th. Guo Ziqing and Lou Yeru both appeared in court. Lou testified as before, while Guo claimed that there had been no abuse or beatings. Guo said that Yang's death was due to a miscarriage, which caused her to be stimulated and take poison. If the judge did not believe him, he could exhume the body for an autopsy. It was announced that the autopsy would take place at Sanlikan on the afternoon of the 20th, causing a sensation throughout the city, with thousands of onlookers. Xu Kui, the prosecutor of the court, arrived at the scene and gathered both parties to sign an agreement before opening the coffin. When the coffin was opened, Yang's face looked as if she were alive. The upper and lower garments were removed for inspection, and there were no injuries on the body. However, there was a large reddish-brown area below the neck and on the chest, which Lou claimed was the fatal injury. Guo said that it was caused by rubbing during the enema. There were also five areas of skin peeling on the buttocks, which Lou also claimed were injuries. Guo said that they were caused by friction when changing clothes and placing her in the coffin. Prosecutor Xu determined that Guo's explanation was reasonable. He then filled out the death report, stating that Yang's death was indeed caused by opium poisoning. The body was then returned to the coffin, and both parties were summoned to the court for trial on the afternoon of the 21st. According to Guo, Lou's false accusations had caused his concubine to be exhumed and her bones disturbed, and he would file a countersuit.</p>

The phrase "not to be involved in disputes due to relations with other countries" in Hull's reply actually implies that the US will tacitly approve Japan's trampling on the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, it convened the second board meeting at 6:00 PM yesterday, attended by Fan Zhongyun, Li Shengwu, Zhang Weicheng, Wang Xinming, Zhang Ke, Xu Zeye, Wu Hanfang, Xu Xingchu, etc. Chaired by Xu Xingchu, the meeting passed a resolution to send a letter to the US President urging him to pay attention to the fulfillment of treaty obligations (to be delivered to the US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Cunningham, for forwarding to Roosevelt). The original text is as follows: "To His Excellency the President of the United States of America, the Chinese people have learned that the understanding between the US government and the Japanese government to resolve any disputes by peaceful means has been established, and we deeply admire Your Excellency's vision for maintaining peace. However, the informal diplomatic note from the United States to the Japanese government on March 3 stated the US attitude of 'not to be involved in disputes due to relations with other countries', implying that the United States would tacitly approve Japan's trampling on the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact and its acts of aggression against China. The Chinese people are deeply concerned about this. The Chinese people believe that although the situation of Japanese aggression against Manchuria, China, caused by the previous Lansing-Ishii Agreement, was the seed of the September 18, 1931 Incident, if the United States continues to adhere to its original intention of safeguarding the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it will still not lose the spirit of the United States and the American people in upholding justice. Now, the US government's informal exchange of notes with the Japanese government suddenly shows the attitude of the United States not to be involved in disputes due to relations with other countries, which means that the US government has replaced the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact with the principles of the Lansing-Ishii Agreement. If this is the case, even though the US government declares that there is no negotiation between the US and Japan, the Chinese people are very worried that any future diplomatic negotiations on the Pacific issue under the principle that the United States will not be involved in disputes due to relations with other countries will take abandoning the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact as a prerequisite, and lead the Pacific issue back to the dark era of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the Lansing-Ishii Agreement. The Chinese people believe that the United States, as the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty, has a moral responsibility to maintain this sacred treaty. If the United States has not forgotten this moral responsibility, then while declaring that the United States will not be involved in disputes due to relations with other countries, it is necessary to set restrictions and make an accompanying statement, such as when treaty obligations exist, other considerations should be made. Otherwise, all sacred treaties will be negated by the principle of not causing disputes. The Chinese people are now holding the will of peaceful struggle to complete the national revolution of China. Their hope for the moral assistance of friendly countries such as the United States is no different from what the Americans expected from France during the American Revolution. The US government and people should be deeply aware of this. Now, at the time when the US government declares that the US government has not had any specific negotiations with the Japanese government, we specially offer infinite enthusiasm and pay the highest respect to Your Excellency the President. If Your Excellency the President can accept this Chinese people's earnest hope through the paper that the United States will not revive the principles of the Lansing-Ishii Agreement, then not only the friendship between China and the United States will be a gift from Your Excellency the President, but also the immortality of world justice will be a gift from Your Excellency the President.

<p>Too Tired from the Journey to See Guests</p>
<p>Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, previously went to North China around Tianjin and Beijing to inspect and meet with Huang Fu of the Beiping Political Council for discussions. Tang has already returned to Nanjing and transferred to Shanghai on the train the night before, arriving yesterday morning. He returned to his private residence on Ganshidong Road to rest. Because of Tang's important mission during his northern trip, many people went to visit him from morning to noon, but most were politely declined by his family members, stating that Tang was tired from traveling. Even newspaper reporters were not received.</p>

<p>First Departure from Shanghai on the 17th of Next Month</p>
<p>Zhang Xianglin Will Accompany and Preside Over Everything</p>
<p>The China Association for Participation in the Chicago Exposition is quite busy these days with the work of collecting exhibits, as the Chicago Exposition is opening early on May 26. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency met with the person in charge of the association yesterday. According to him, the association's participation in the Chicago Exposition last year was very successful. The goal of collecting exhibits this time is to focus on trade, as China's famous products and natural works of art can attract the attention of Americans, and sales will definitely be smooth in the future. Currently, the items from various places that have responded to the call for participation and have been shipped to Shanghai include Yixing pottery, Fujian lacquerware, etc. As for other items that have not yet been shipped to Shanghai, telegrams have been sent to urge them to be shipped to Shanghai before April 15, in preparation for shipment on April 17 to participate. At that time, Zhang Xianglin, the general representative of the association, will accompany and preside over everything. Regarding the shipping costs for the participating exhibits, the association has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry, which has been forwarded to the National Government, requesting that all transportation agencies be allowed to exempt taxes.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Talk by Lin Aimin, Manager of the Nanyang Singapore Daily <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Negotiating Overseas Chinese Investment in the Motherland</p>
<p>Introducing National Products for Sale in Nanyang</p>
<p>Lin Aimin, Manager of the Nanyang Singapore Daily, recently received an order from Hu Wenhu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the newspaper, to return to China to negotiate overseas Chinese investment in the motherland and the promotion of national products in Nanyang, as well as to conduct a supplementary investigation into news and education matters. He arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited his residence yesterday and received a detailed account from Mr. Lin about the education and life of the overseas Chinese in the area, the organization of the Singapore Daily, and his mission in returning to China, which is divided into the following sections:</p>
<h3 id="e113">Chen Jiageng Bankrupt <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The reporter first inquired about the long-term causes and current situation of the bankruptcy of the rubber company of Chen Jiageng, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman in the area. According to him, the bankruptcy of the company was not accidental, but was caused by the impact of the current global recession. Production and sales were sluggish, and there was even a risk of overproduction. At the same time, there was no way to reduce costs and wages. As a last resort, he voluntarily declared liquidation and mortgaged all assets of the branch companies in various places to the bank, which was managed and controlled by the creditors. As for the total amount of assets, I am not very clear, but I only know that the total amount of debt reached more than 10 million yuan. The difference between the auction of assets as collateral is only several hundred thousand yuan. It has not yet been decided how much of the debt clearance will be distributed.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Mission After Returning to China <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>I (Mr. Lin speaking of himself) was ordered by the chairman of our newspaper to return to China to negotiate overseas Chinese investment, introduce national products for sale in Nanyang, and conduct a supplementary investigation into news undertakings, educational facilities, and the production and sales of national products in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Although many national products are imported in that area, they are often unsuitable for local customs, habits, and climate, so they are mostly inapplicable. This is really caused by the separation between the two parties. My mission here is to connect overseas Chinese and the motherland so that they can communicate with each other. On the one hand, I will introduce the construction and production situation of domestic industrial and commercial enterprises to the local overseas Chinese, pay attention at any time, and facilitate investment. On the other hand, I will contact the National Products Production and Sales Association and the National Products Production and Sales Introduction Association in this city to sell national products in the area according to local needs. Recently, I heard that Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry will go to Nanyang, and I will also pay him a visit soon to make some contact.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Education and Life <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>There are many overseas Chinese schools in the area. According to my observation, very few are generally run with special achievements. The lives of the overseas Chinese are very simple and mostly left to fate. Therefore, although there are many overseas Chinese in the area in recent years, they have no power at all. In addition, the local consulate is very strict in its management, and all letters and books sent from the motherland to the area are subject to strict inspection. Occasionally, if you are not careful, you will be subject to local legal sanctions. If the motherland is indifferent to overseas Chinese affairs, and the overseas Chinese themselves do not realize and try to improve their living habits, then the future is difficult to imagine. At the same time, it is also very sad.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Talking About the Singapore Daily <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Singapore Daily was founded by Mr. Hu Wenhu, a wealthy overseas Chinese in the area, with a private donation of 500,000 yuan. It has been more than four years since then. It is published twice a day, in the morning and evening, with a circulation of 20,000 copies. There is also a pictorial on Sundays, so it is very popular among the local overseas Chinese. In addition, a commemorative book is published every anniversary. The fourth anniversary is the "New Fujian" issue, which contains facts about the province's administration, education, society, and people. The fifth anniversary is planned to be the "New Guangxi" issue. In terms of public opinion, although there is no absolute possibility of freedom, the words to be said are not insincere. The views and criticisms on the situation in the motherland are published in detail, so that the overseas Chinese will not be increasingly separated from the situation in the motherland.</p>

<p>Scheduled to Fly to Fuzhou from Longhua Airport on the 31st</p>
<p>The Purpose is to Test the Possibility of Long-Distance Flight</p>
<p>Since the Jiang Feng aircraft, manufactured by the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office, was converted into a seaplane, it has flown to Hankou, Nantong and other places several times, but long-distance flights along the coast have not yet been attempted. Therefore, it was decided to depart from the Longhua Jiangmian Seaplane Airport at 7:00 AM on the 31st of this month, still driven by instructor Xu Chengqi, and fly along the coast to Fuzhou to test the aircraft's ability for long-distance flight. It is scheduled to fly back to Shanghai on the next day, April 1, and then schedule flights to Shantou, Guangzhou, Hankou, Tianjin and other places for long-distance flights, in order to promote the achievements of domestically produced aircraft and encourage the public in various places to be interested in aviation. If the weather does not change drastically on the date of departure, it will not be changed.</p>
<h3 id="e118">China Aviation's Business is Progressing Day by Day <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Chongqing-Chengdu Line is Particularly Prosperous, and There are More Passengers and Less Mail on the Shanghai-Guangdong Line.</p>
<p>Flights Were Mostly Delayed Yesterday Morning Due to Heavy Fog</p>
<p>Business Progress: Yesterday, according to Li Diezhuang, secretary of China Aviation Corporation, to a reporter from the Shanghai Aviation News Agency, the company's business is progressing day by day. The business between Chongqing and Chengdu is particularly prosperous. The company is planning to purchase powerful aircraft so that it can fly from Shanghai to Chengdu in one day. The income on the Shanghai-Ping Line has also increased recently. There are more passengers and less mail on the Shanghai-Guangdong Line. It seems that the number of flights must be increased.</p>
<p>Flight Delays: Yesterday morning, thick fog was dense. The westbound flight on the Shanghai-Hankou Line flew out of Longhua once, but immediately returned. As a result, the mail and aviation newspapers that could have been transferred to the Hankou-Chengdu Line today were missed. Today, Monday, is a day off, but in order to avoid delays in passengers and mail, the company still flew to Hankou as usual. The southbound flight on the Shanghai-Ping Line and the northbound flight on the Shanghai-Guangdong Line, which should have arrived in Shanghai yesterday, were changed to fly today due to bad weather.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Far East Problem in the Sound of US-Japan Coordination <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Xia Jinlin Gave a Lecture at the International Society</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency Reported that the Chinese International Society, because the recent sound of US-Japan coordination is very noisy and the Far East problem is very large, held the first international lecture at the Shanghai Lianhuan Society at 4:00 PM yesterday, inviting Dr. Xia Jinlin, former first secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the United States, to give a lecture on "The Far East Peace Problem in the Sound of US-Japan Coordination". More than 80 people attended, including members of the society, students from various universities, and reporters from various newspapers. Mr. Xia described in detail the relationship between Britain, the United States, Russia and Japan and the future trends, which are divided into the following sections:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Destroying Peace <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>After the September 18 Incident occupied the Northeast, it destroyed the peace between the international community in the following three aspects: 1. Since the European War, the League of Nations has worked hard for more than ten years, and each member guarantees international peace. 2. The secret agreement between Japan and Russia from 1907 to 1916 to divide Manchuria equally. 3. The Nine-Power Treaty of the Washington Conference in 1922 to protect China's territorial and administrative integrity. Therefore, all small countries in the League of Nations were terrified and unanimously criticized Japan, but unfortunately it did not work. The United States, which convened the Washington Conference, also declared that the United States regards the Nine-Power Treaty and the naval treaty as a whole and does not allow them to be separated.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Japan-Russia Relations <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The most closely related to the Northeast is the Soviet Union. Japan also regards the Soviet Union as the target of attack, not only wanting to drive it out of Manchuria, but also wanting to drive it out of Siberia and establish a white Russian independent country east of Lake Baikal. Before, Japan transferred troops stationed in North China to the Manchuria-Li area, which was about to break out. However, because the opinions of the three provinces of the Navy, Army and Foreign Affairs were not consistent, and the two foreign provinces did not express their consent, it eased. The Soviet Union then proposed the sale of the Middle East Road to show that it had no ambitions in the Far East and hoped to peacefully maintain the territory of Siberia. The policy of Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota towards Russia is that after the establishment of Manchukuo, there are many people who need to engage in construction, and they should never lightly start a war. The main points are to proceed in three steps: 1. Buy the Middle East Road, 2. Sign a Japan-Russia non-aggression treaty, 3. Sign a Russian-Manchurian border treaty.</p>
<h3 id="e122">British View of the Far East <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The second most closely related to the Far East after Soviet Russia is Britain. There is a historical relationship between Britain and Japan. There is mutual understanding between the various departments of the two countries' navies, armies and foreign affairs, especially when Japan replaced Britain to protect the interests of the Far East during the European War. Therefore, British Foreign Minister Simon often made pro-Japanese remarks in the League of Nations. Although there are other reasons, his attitude can also be seen. On January 7, 1932, the United States' Stimson issued a non-recognition note. At that time, the United States believed that other countries would definitely express their opinions. However, the British Foreign Office declared on January 9 that it only involved territorial openness and did not infringe on its commercial interests, without talking about the territorial and administrative integrity of China. On the 11th, the London Times, representing the British government, published a commentary praising the British government for not expressing its views on this, saying that it was not Britain's task to protect China's territorial and administrative integrity, and that there had never been a fact of China's territorial and administrative integrity. Although British public opinion expressed sympathy for China, the government regarded this as a specialized issue that could not be understood by the general public.</p>
<h3 id="e123">American Attitude <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Next, let's talk about the United States. In terms of trade and investment relations, the United States' trade with China is far less than its trade with Japan. However, the United States has always paid great attention to me and has placed infinite hope on me. However, whenever it takes action, it always explores Britain's attitude first. Britain is also the same, often hesitating and undecided. Japan takes advantage of the hesitation and speculation between the two countries to obtain convenience. When Roosevelt convened a meeting on the world economic conference last summer, the United States expressed deep sympathy for me, but I must be able to unify and build a national policy. At that time, after Hirota took office, the Japanese diplomatic authorities immediately transferred Saito to be the US ambassador to correct past mistakes. Therefore, there have been reports of coordination recently. However, according to the various sections of the negotiations reported in the newspapers, it is not necessarily the case. For example, the opening of the Manchurian gateway and welcome investment are nothing new. As for the immigration issue, recognizing Manchukuo, and allowing the Philippines to be independent, it is said that the United States and Japan are in negotiations, which is definitely not true. In addition, the naval ratio issue, that is, changing the 5:5:3 ratio to 11:11:8, Japan will never give up, but it may indicate that it can make slight concessions at future meetings to reassure the United States. This is the reason for the change in the atmosphere of US-Japan relations. Although this is only a change in the atmosphere, it is an infinite victory for Japanese diplomacy in an isolated state.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Future Trends <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Before there are major changes in the Far East, Britain and the United States will never recognize Manchukuo. Now that the balance of power in the Far East has been destroyed, Britain must move to determine its Far East policy. If Japan's continental policy continues to progress, will Britain use force to protect its original forces in the Yangtze River basin, or will it give it up? As far as we know, during the years of the Republic of China, there was a movement to take back the concessions and recover foreign powers. The British government did prepare to give up, so the future trend is to give up the Yangtze River forces as a more likely possibility.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Anhui She-Yu Road Public Bonds Drawn for Redemption Yesterday in Shanghai <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Total Principal and Interest Redemption Exceeds 40,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Payments to Commence at the End of This Month</p>
<p>The Industrial Society announced that the Anhui Provincial Government's She-Yu Road public bonds, issued last year, underwent their third drawing yesterday at 2 p.m. at the Bank Association at 4 Hong Kong Road in the city. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were present to supervise. A total of six bonds were drawn, with a total of 47,600 yuan in principal and interest to be redeemed. Bondholders whose bonds were drawn will receive payment at the end of this month from the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank branches and the Anhui county governments. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees　Yesterday's attendees included Mao Yun from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wang Xiaolai (represented by Zhu Boyuan) from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wang Boyuan from the Bank Association, Cheng Zhuxin, Cheng Linsheng, Zheng Jianyuan, Xu Chuanyou, Guo Rutai, Deng Jijiang, Wang Boyuan from the Kenye Bank, Jiang Huancong, Lin Zhuo, and Wang Darang from the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Zhang Yizhai from the Hui-Ning Association, Xu Yunlin, Luo Changming, and Ji Dafu from the She County Association, Xu Kaixian from the Qi-Men Association, and over twenty others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report　After the customary formalities, Chairman Cheng Zhuxin reported that the She-Yu Road is 61 kilometers long. The original estimated construction cost was 900,000 yuan. Subsequently, half of the construction cost was borne by Zhejiang, and subsidies were obtained from the National Economic Council. Therefore, although the public bonds were not fully subscribed, the road has been completed. In the past, fellow Anhui natives living abroad had to return home every few years, but now they can travel back and forth several times a year. Furthermore, the Tunxi Defense Corps incident was quickly quelled due to the completion of this road and convenient transportation. Although Anhui's construction is somewhat lagging behind, Chairman Liu and Director Liu are determined to build a new Anhui. The road's funds are very reliable. He hopes that fellow natives will actively support it, and that the construction of the new Anhui will begin with this as a starting point. Zhang Yizhai then spoke, and Xu Chuanyou explained the drawing method.</p>
<p>Winning Numbers　After the speeches, supervisors Mao Yun, Zheng Jianyuan, Ji Dafu, Wang Boyuan, and others inspected the drawing slips and the registry. The drawing was then conducted, and six bonds were drawn. The winning numbers are "No. 15," "No. 21," "No. 51," "No. 57," "No. 77," and "No. 90," with a total principal and interest redemption amount of 47,600 yuan. The numbers were entered into the registry, and the Fund Management Committee will publish a public notice so that everyone is informed.</p>

<p>Minister Kong States Absolutely No Such Thing</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that, regarding recent rumors that the government plans to devalue the currency, which, if true, would cause drastic changes in the financial system and greatly affect all businesses, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, yesterday to inquire about the matter. According to Wang, he had heard rumors of devaluation a few days ago, but he knew that it was definitely not true. Since the abolition of taels, China's financial system has gradually become unified. At this time, it is impossible to change it lightly. Because the current organization is incomplete and the foundation is weak, imitating the United States will only cause more harm than good. Furthermore, he personally asked Minister Kong about this matter yesterday, and Kong replied that not only does the government have no such plans, but he has not even heard of such a thing, which further proves that the rumors are absolutely not credible.</p>

<p>Inferior Goods Replaced with Red Bee-Fish Trademark</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Chambers of Commerce Unions, stating: "We are writing to inform you that on March 23, our member, the Paper Trade Association, reported that on March 8, our inspection team received a tip that someone in the De-Xing South Alley of Xiang-Fen Lane, North Stone Road, in the Public Concession was altering and counterfeiting Japanese Yu-Guang paper with Western goods. We immediately dispatched personnel to investigate and found the Feng-Yu-Hua store. Inside, we saw five bundles of Japanese white Yu-Guang paper, with Hong Chang-Yu supervising workers altering and counterfeiting Western goods, replacing the trademark with a red bee-fish design, and printing the words 'Feng-Yu-Hua Store' on the plywood. We immediately brought samples of the paper and trademark to report. The matter concerns the private sale of enemy goods. The trademark sample will be displayed and announced in the city. On March 9, the team submitted five proposed measures, and we approved the first to third measures, which are consistent with the measures for punishing fellow traders decided at the members' representative meeting on October 2, 1931. We will implement them first. The fourth and fifth proposals were approved at the fourth executive committee meeting of the association on March 16. In addition to sending letters to the paper trade associations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to investigate and refuse to purchase, we are also sending this letter for your review and forwarding to the chambers of commerce in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to investigate. The Feng-Yu-Hua store alters inferior paper to counterfeit Western goods, replacing the trademark with a red bee-fish design. The Paper Trade Association has investigated and reported this, which is damaging to the anti-Japanese goods. All fellow traders should refuse to trade with them to show their disapproval. We are writing to inform you and hope that your association will investigate and promptly send a notice to the chambers of commerce in various places to refuse to sell the altered Yu-Guang paper. We sincerely hope for your assistance."</p>

<p>Recognized by Major Jurists</p>
<p>Liu Renhang initiated the Kun-Hua Datong Movement. He lectured in India, and American women, after reading the reports, wrote to the Chinese Consul in India, Lu, hoping that he would go to America. Recently, he received a letter from Dr. Hu Yonglin, the Chinese representative of the French World Peace Association, stating: "To Mr. Linghua, I recently received a letter from the President of the World Peace Association in Paris, dated February 11, stating that the report of December last year has been submitted to the association for discussion. Regarding the 'International Maternity' issue advocated by Mr. Liu, the association's Legal Committee (composed of legal experts and lawyers from the Paris High Court) has determined that this issue is of great value. Its nature seems to be promoting women's participation in politics. However, in law, the political rights of men and women should be equal. Neither women nor men should monopolize rights. "I am informing you of this." After receiving this letter, Mr. Liu has submitted a second proposal to Dr. Hu to be forwarded to the French Peace Association for implementation, restricting the male's exclusive power to slaughter for five thousand years.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Mobile Exhibition of Agricultural Products Opened Yesterday in Jiangwan <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Central Government Sends Representatives to Give Speeches</p>
<p>Farmers from Various Districts Actively Visit</p>
<p>The mobile exhibition of agricultural products, organized by the Municipal Agricultural Association, opened at Tongji University in Jiangwan yesterday at 1 p.m. The exhibition also began in the Party Headquarters of the Seventh District. Farmers from various districts flocked to participate. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony　The opening ceremony was held in the auditorium of Tongji University at 1 p.m. Attendees included central government representative Liu Xiusheng, municipal party headquarters representative Zhang Huijun, and over a hundred representatives from various district agricultural associations and groups. The presidium included Yu Zhenhui, Diao Qing'en, and Wu Ziku. After the meeting began, the chairman gave an opening speech, stating that holding an agricultural exhibition is in line with the current needs of rural China. The agricultural association has a close relationship with farmers, so holding mobile agricultural exhibitions in various districts can promote and improve agricultural affairs and increase production. He hoped that farmers would actively participate to increase their knowledge. The central government representative then provided guidance, stating that the biggest reason for rural bankruptcy in China is the lack of improvement in agricultural affairs. Holding an agricultural exhibition has a profound meaning, and farmers should pay attention to this and strive to implement it. Other representatives also gave speeches, which were insightful and inspiring. After the meeting, there were recreational performances to add to the fun.</p>
<p>Exhibition Location　The exhibits at the Party Headquarters of the Seventh District are divided into categories such as crops, horticulture, new agricultural tools, fisheries and animal husbandry, statistics, and survey tables, totaling over 2,000 items. The displays are well-organized and orderly. The exhibition hall is divided into five areas. The main hall has the most specimens. A horizontal plaque hangs in the center, reading "Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Association Agricultural Products Exhibition." Two pillars have couplets: "Cultivate virtue and enrich life, devote oneself to agriculture, develop talents and utilize them, show me the way," and "Cultivation depends on farmers, hoping to increase field production, improvement depends on science, good varieties are left for people to observe." The exhibits are dazzling and beautiful.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Child Welfare Association Reports on Abuse Cases Investigated Over the Past Year <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Totaling One Hundred Cases</p>
<p>Various Types</p>
<p>The Protection Group of the China Child Welfare Association is dedicated to protecting the legitimate rights of children. Its work over the past year has been very intensive. In addition to investigating child prostitutes, rescuing street children, studying the lives of child labourers, and researching children run over by vehicles, it also pays special attention to cases of child trafficking, oppression, corporal punishment, incitement, and confinement. Therefore, the association hired Zhao Weitian, a former investigation expert from the Ministry of Industry, to assist Wang Guanyi, the director of the group, and other staff to work separately. The results have been very good. Here is a summary of one hundred child abuse cases handled by the association in the past year, including: 18 cases of abused maids, 7 cases of abused adopted daughters-in-law, 10 cases of abused apprentices, 10 cases of stepmothers abusing children, 6 cases of mothers abusing children, 18 cases of forcing daughters into prostitution, 11 cases of child abandonment, 3 cases of abduction of innocent girls, 1 case of child fraud, 1 case of child crime, and 17 cases of relief for orphaned and special children. For the above one hundred cases, the association has registered the names, genders, ages, origins, sources of information, locations of incidents, dates of incidents, brief descriptions of the abuse, attitudes of neighbours, and methods of investigation in a concise table, and sent letters to various political, police, and legal institutions in the Chinese and concession areas for record.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Zhang Naiqi Lectures on the Past and Future of Silver Prices <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge area invited Zhang Naiqi, president of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, to lecture on the past and future of silver prices. The speech was recorded by Bingxun Stenography Agency. It stated that China is a silver standard country, and changes in silver prices are closely related to changes in commodity prices. Foreign gold-using countries regard silver as a commodity, and fluctuations in its price are insignificant. In the past, when gold was expensive and silver was cheap, only traders and manufacturers could profit slightly. Farmers, workers, and general consumers all suffered losses. Now, various countries have abandoned the gold standard, silver prices have risen, and commodity prices have fallen. Farmers have suffered great losses, factories have closed, and workers have lost their jobs. Therefore, what we hope for is stable silver prices, so that social life can be stable. The reason why the United States is raising silver prices is to compete for the Chinese market. When silver prices rise, the prices of American goods fall, making them easier to sell in China. Moreover, American investments in China are mostly in public utilities, such as electricity and telephone. If silver prices rise, their dollar capital will be more stable. Our country's countermeasures include prohibiting silver exports, but this is difficult to achieve. The silver issue is not a central issue for our country. Our country is currently in a semi-colonial position and has become an international market, to be contested by others, like a public servant. Remedial methods include (1) tariff barriers and (2) trade management. However, both of these are not easy to implement. If you want to implement it, there is only national revolution.</p>

<p>Deputy Manager Li Chaoyuan Is the Younger Brother of the Late President Li</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry has taken back the Central Agricultural and Commercial Bank, which is owned by the government and business capital. The funds have been fully collected, and the bank will be opened on a scheduled date. It was reported in this newspaper that the general manager of the bank is Mei Zhezhi, a native of Guangdong, a Doctor of Philosophy from Peking University, and a Doctor of Economics from Harvard University in the United States. He has served as supervisor of the Chaozhou Customs and the Jianghan Customs, and as the chief secretary of the Ministry of Industry. Deputy Manager Li Chaoyuan is a Bachelor of Arts from Peking University and a Master of Philosophy from the University of Toulouse in France. He has served as supervisor of the Jingzhou and Kuizhou Customs, and has a long-standing reputation in the financial circles of Wuhan, Hankou, Pingjin and other places. He has served as chairman and president of companies and banks. He is the younger brother of former President Li Songqing. It is said that Wang Yan, a well-known businessman in Shanghai, is being considered for the position of manager of the bank. The bank began preparations in the spring of last year and was originally scheduled to open on April 1. However, due to the large-scale construction of the building at the corner of Ningbo Road and Henan Road, the interior decoration and various equipment have not yet been completed. The date will be announced after the construction is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Qingming Festival Should Ban the Welcoming and Worshipping of City God Statues <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Recently, some people have used the pretext of the continuous depression of the market and the stagnation of commerce to propose the restoration of the Welcoming and Worshipping of City God Statues, which has been abolished for many years, during the abolished lunar Qingming Festival. Therefore, they have collected more than 10,000 yuan in membership fees in recent days and summoned the three classes and six rooms scattered in various places to reorganize. However, the authorities in this city have already issued a clear internal order to ban this Welcoming and Worshipping of City God Statues. Furthermore, the decline of the market over the years is fundamentally due to the bankruptcy of the rural areas in the interior. How can one seek prosperity in clay and wooden puppets? Moreover, this city is closely watched by both Chinese and foreigners. In this time of breaking superstitions, if this contradictory and strange phenomenon reappears in society, it will be ridiculed by informed people. Furthermore, the money that could be put to good use will be wasted on useless things, and a large team of pre-Qing feudal-era guards will parade through the streets, which will not only waste people's money but also hinder traffic. It is also easy to cause trouble and disrupt public order. Therefore, if this Welcoming and Worshipping of City God Statues is actually held during the abolished lunar Qingming Festival, the Municipal Public Security Bureau will strictly ban it.</p>

<p>Since its establishment five years ago, the fingerprint division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau has achieved remarkable results. The establishment of a fingerprint division by a Chinese police agency was pioneered by the bureau. Fingerprinting has become an important specialty for Chinese police authorities. Other public security bureaus in provinces and cities that have established fingerprint divisions include the capital, Beiping, Hankou, and Hangzhou. Many others are in the process of preparing to establish them. It is reported that the Municipal Public Security Bureau has taken the fingerprints of more than 39,740 male and female offenders in these five years. The number of repeat offenders identified daily is 2,694, including 250 major criminals such as communists and kidnappers. There are also 1,870 offenders with three or four offenses and eight or nine offenses. The division director, Zeng Shude, and the clerk, Song Yuntao, have investigated numerous cases outside the city, and public security bureaus and courts at all levels in various provinces and cities have sent more than 50 requests for fingerprint identification. It is reported that Director Zeng and Clerk Song plan to organize a fingerprint training school during the summer vacation to train fingerprint specialists. All plans are actively underway.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Thieves Reconnoiter Houses Under the Pretext of Renting <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Obtain Handguns and Rob</p>
<p>Those Renting Out Houses Should Be Careful</p>
<p>Ms. Lu Jiang, a local woman, lives at No. 34, Lane 563, Changanli, Yangshupu. At around 5 a.m. on July 10 last year, she was invaded by several robbers who brandished handguns and forbade her to make any noise. They robbed her of property worth tens of dollars and were reported to the police for arrest. The Yulin Road police detectives Su Changsheng and Yang Peisheng arrested two suspects, Yu Qianxing from Ningbo and Zhu Jinsheng, a local, at No. 7 Yulin Road and Changanli and detained them in the police station. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Public Works Department stated that the defendants had looked at the exits and routes of the house under the pretext of renting. They then borrowed a handgun from someone named A-Zhang (investigation revealed that A-Zhang's surname was Yan, and he was from Ningbo. He was shot to death on August 22 last year at 9:15 p.m. in a remote area of Guiyang Road, Yangshupu. The reason was that he supplied handguns to others for robbery and shared the loot. This was reported in a previous newspaper). They went with A-Fu and others, who are still at large, to rob. When Yu was arrested, he took the detectives to the scene, where Zhu Jinsheng was pointed out and arrested. He requested an extension to investigate. Yu Qianxing confessed that A-Fu invited him to go, and the handgun was borrowed by A-Hua from A-Zhang. Zhu Jinsheng did not go, and he did not reveal it. A week before the incident, a man named Rongsheng was chatting with A-Hua about the Lu family having money. He heard it in the room. The rest of his confession was vague. The victim, Ms. Lu Jiang, testified about the robbery. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be detained and investigated further.</p>

<h3 id="e145">The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Others Again Petition for the Release of Native Sugar Shipped from Beihai to Shanghai <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, along with the Cotton Industry Association, yesterday jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Customs Administration, stating: "Regarding the approved joint telegram from the assemblies of Hepu, Lingshan, and Qin counties in Guangdong, Beihai sugar merchants last year shipped native sugar to Shanghai but were subsequently detained by the Jianghai Customs, penalized, and required to pay supplementary taxes. Various chambers of commerce and organizations dispatched personnel to Beijing to petition. This January, 92 bags of Henghelong's Shanghai Fushen native sugar were again detained, claiming that its optical rotation was high, indicating it was mixed with foreign sugar. It is not known that Qinlian is rich in sugarcane, and improved manufacturing methods produce sugar that is strong and bright, comparable to foreign-made sugar. This time, the sugar shipped by Henghelong is indeed produced by the Lingwulilunchang Sugar Factory, purely domestic goods. The Jianghai Customs does not distinguish between genuine and fake, arbitrarily ruining [businesses], impacting the countryside, and arousing strong emotions among the people who have appealed to various counties. This matter concerns the people's livelihoods. Besides taking sugar samples from the three counties, affixed with seals and notarized for verification, we respectfully telegraph, earnestly requesting the release of the detained sugar, and instructing all customs offices to protect the safe export of native sugar, to maintain people's livelihoods, etc." According to our investigation, this case was reported on February of this year, requesting remedies based on the two points stated by the sugar merchant representatives, in order to ease the sugar merchants' burden. To date, no reply has been received. Now, based on the aforementioned telegram, the native sugar shipped to Shanghai by Henghelong is indeed a local product of Lingshan, jointly notarized and verified by the three counties, and is not mixed with foreign sugar, which should be trustworthy. It is appropriate to truthfully telegraph, earnestly requesting your approval, to immediately release the aforementioned detained sugar, and instruct all customs offices to protect the export of Guangdong-produced native sugar in the future, so that the last line of native sugar can survive. We would be deeply grateful. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Sugar Industry Association, with seals.</p>

<p>Jin Huafu, a native of Shaoxing, 34 years old, and the manager of the Weixin Yarn and Cloth Factory on Rue Remi, in the French Concession, suddenly checked into the Shenzhou Grand Hotel on Zhejiang Road around 1 p.m. the day before yesterday. The hotel clerk guided [him to] room 306. At that time, he wrote his name as Wang Gongji, a businessman, local, and paid ten yuan for the room. He went out shortly afterward and did not return until late at night, when he closed the door and went to bed. Unexpectedly, he had not gotten up by noon yesterday. The tea servers were greatly suspicious and knocked on the door, but there was no response for a long time. When they opened the door and went inside, they saw Jin sleeping under the covers. The tea servers thought he was sound asleep and tried to wake him up, lifting the covers, but saw his face was pale and he was barely breathing. There were some traces of tobacco next to his pillow, indicating he had taken poison. They hurried to report to the clerk, who reported to the police, who sent detectives to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctors, it was determined that he had swallowed raw opium in an attempt to end his life. They immediately made him vomit, but because he had been poisoned too deeply, his condition was critical. He was still unconscious last night, so the reason for his suicide is still unknown.</p>

<p>The Number of Thefts and Robberies Has Increased Significantly Compared to the Past</p>
<p>The Laozha Police Station Orders Strict Precautions</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the social economy has fallen into a state of depression. The number of businesses that went bankrupt at the end of last year is unknown. As a result, the number of unemployed people has increased, leading them to become bandits. The number of robberies and thefts has increased significantly compared to the past, especially since the beginning of spring. You A'gen, the Chinese Chief Detective of the Laozha Police Station, believes that the areas under his jurisdiction, such as Nanjing Road, Fuzhou Road, and Zhejiang Road, are all commercial centers and are full of hotels, making it inevitable that criminals will hide among them, plotting wrongdoing. Therefore, starting yesterday, he ordered all on-duty detectives to be fully armed, divided into more than ten teams, to patrol the streets starting at 5 p.m. If there is an alert, they should gather and arrest the bandits. They should also inspect all hotels at any time, and if there are suspicious people, they must be interrogated. Such precautions should prevent bandits from appearing.</p>

<p>Thieves Chisel Through an Eight-Inch Thick Cement Floor</p>
<p>Theft Was Accomplished After Three Attempts</p>
<p>| Fourteen Male and Female Criminals Arrested, 44 Bolts of Original Stolen Goods Recovered |</p>
<p>The major broadcloth theft case at the Blue Funnel Wharf's E Warehouse in Pudong, where goods worth more than 10,000 yuan were stolen on the night of the President's birthday celebration, was previously reported. Now, after a full investigation by all the detectives of the Customs Water Police Station, the entire case has been solved, and 14 male and female criminals have been arrested, along with 44 bolts of the original stolen goods. The process was extremely complex and is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e156">Ingenious Theft Method <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Chen Deben, Chen Dezhong, Dai Kedao, Tang Lirong, and others, four water-based thieves, learned that the Blue Funnel E Warehouse was built on a frame above the beach. There was space under the warehouse for people, but the outside was walled off with a short wall to prevent tide water from entering. However, there were still gaps in the short wall that could be crossed. They came up with a novel idea. In the dark of night in the eleventh month of the Lunar calendar last year, they snuck under the warehouse and began to chisel through the eight-inch thick cement floor of the warehouse. However, the cement was very strong. The first time, they only chiseled away one inch. At the end of the month, they continued to chisel away two or three inches but still could not penetrate it. It was not until the evening of the fourth day of the first month of this year that they entered for the third time and finally chiseled a round hole 15 inches in diameter through the bottom of the E Warehouse, large enough for one person to climb through. However, a large pile of yellow rattan was stacked above the hole, making it impossible to push it away. They then bribed Sun Kaisheng, the stacker of the warehouse, to secretly find a way to move the rattan away and reported the news to him as an inside accomplice. When the President's birthday celebration arrived, the warehouse was sealed off, and no one could enter or leave. Chen and the others took the opportunity to hire a cargo ship owned by Wu A'er that evening, anchored near the beach. They climbed through the round hole into the warehouse in succession, stealing ten boxes of broadcloth one after another, gradually moving them from under the warehouse through the passage to the ship. When finished, they boarded the ship with the loot and sailed away.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Cracking the Case Through Selling Stolen Goods <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>When the warehouse was opened on the morning of the 13th of this month, it was discovered that a large amount of broadcloth had been stolen, totaling 52 bolts, worth 15,000 yuan. The warehouse immediately reported to the Customs Water Police Station for investigation. After receiving the report, the police station immediately ordered all detectives to investigate separately. The detectives soon learned that several criminals who had stolen goods from the Xinhuishan Wharf four or five years ago had all fled. Therefore, it was determined that they had committed the crime. However, after searching for several days, there was still no news. Unexpectedly, the thieves had already secretly entrusted several foreign goods brokers, Gong Zuosheng, Zheng Haosheng, Zhou Zhihe, Chen Xinsheng, Lu Meisheng, Xu Guifu, and others, to sell [the stolen goods] in various markets. The scheme was not airtight and was detected by the detectives, who worked day and night for several days and succeeded in cracking the case.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Investigation Process <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>First, the Chinese and foreign detectives of the police station received a confidential report that someone was carrying stolen goods to sell in the market. They joined forces with detectives from the French Concession Police Station and arrested Gong Zuoxing, a fence, at No. 11 Houshun Lane, Xiaobeimen, seizing two bolts of the original stolen goods. Under questioning, he confessed that he had been entrusted by Zheng Haosheng and Zhou Zhihe, two accomplices, to sell them. Western detectives were dispatched to guard the original location and subsequently arrested Zheng Haosheng. Zheng confessed to Zhou's address, and Zhou Zhihe and Chen Xinsheng were arrested. Under interrogation, they revealed that the thieves lived at No. 6 Bulin Lane, Gongguan Road. Detectives were then dispatched to that location and arrested Tang Lirong, one of the thieves, and Wu A'er, the boatman who transported the stolen goods. They confessed to the addresses of their accomplices. The detectives then went to room 40 of the Juying Hotel at North Chujia Bridge and arrested the main criminals, Chen Dezhong, Dai Kedao, and Chen Deben. By this point, nine criminals had been arrested. Under strict questioning about the location of the stolen goods, Zhou Zhihe confessed that they had been handed over to Lu Meisheng for sale. The detectives learned that Lu worked at the China Native Products Company at No. 8 Huayuan Lane in the Nanshi. Two days after the theft occurred, the company suddenly closed. Chen A'er, the old clerk of the company, was arrested and confessed that Lu lived at No. 16 Anji Lane, Jixiang Road, Zhabei. Lu was arrested and taken to No. 120 East Street in the city, where the police officers of the Public Security Bureau recovered nine bolts of the original stolen goods. Another 21 bolts of the original stolen goods were found at No. 11 Yanhai Lane, Laobeimen. According to Lu, 20 more bolts had been taken away by Zhou Kaidi and Xu Guifu. The police then dispatched detectives to arrest Zhou. Zhou pointed out that Lu and Xu had secretly transported the stolen goods to Nanjing and pawned them at a certain bank. The detectives took a train to Nanjing overnight, went to the bank, and recovered 12 bolts. Eight bolts (including one that had been cut open) had already been taken away by Xu, who had disappeared. Subsequently, Sun Kaisheng, the stacker of the warehouse, and Lin Zhu, a woman who concealed the stolen goods, were arrested. In total, 14 men and women were arrested, and 44 bolts of the original stolen goods were recovered. The head detectives questioned them separately, and their confessions matched the facts. They are scheduled to be brought to the local court today for interrogation. The original stolen goods are temporarily stored at the police station, awaiting return to the owner.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Special Court Investigation of the Xu Case Concluded <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>| Shao Xubai and Others Not Prosecuted |</p>
<p>Believing That Ye Jiaxing and Four Others Were More Culpable</p>
<p>Public Prosecution Filed Against Them in Accordance with Article 146 of the Criminal Law</p>
<p>The First Special District Court of this city believed that the Xu Case Assistance Committee of various organizations had published declarations in various newspapers from January 22nd to 27th, and that the content insulted the court and was suspected of obstructing official duties. Therefore, the Procuratorate ordered all 17 members of the committee, including Ye Jiaxing, to be summoned for investigation. Ye Jiaxing, Wang Honghui, Wang Hanliang, Xue Guangqian, Li Ruzhang, Shao Xubai, Huang Xianggu, and Jiang Chiping were each ordered to post 300 yuan in cash bail and await review. It is now learned that the case has been closed by Prosecutor Zhong.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Conclusion of Investigation <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Shao Xubai, Huang Xianggu, Jiang Chiping, Zhang Yichen, Chen Binghui, Yu Jingyu, Sun Mingqi, Zhang Dafu, Shu Huizhen, Cao Zhigong, Hu Yibo, Zhu Yangwu, and Yan Dingyong, the advertising director of the New Sound News Agency, will not be prosecuted due to insufficient evidence of a crime. The other five people, such as Ye Jiaxing, Wang Honghui, Wang Hanliang, Xue Guangqian, and Li Ruzhang, are considered to have more serious circumstances and will be publicly prosecuted in accordance with Article 146, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The full text of the disposition is recorded below. The defendants listed on the right are in the Republic of China Year 20 Investigation Character No. 20.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Obstruction of Official Duties <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the suspected crimes, the investigation has been concluded and should be disposed of separately as follows: Ye Jiaxing, Wang Honghui, Wang Hanliang, Xue Guangqian, and Li Ruzhang should be prosecuted. Zhang Yichen, Chen Binghui, Yu Jingyu, Sun Mingqi, Zhang Dafu, Shu Huizhen, Cao Zhigong, Huang Xianggu, Jiang Chiping, Shao Xubai, Hu Yibo, Zhu Yangwu, and Yan Dingyong should not be prosecuted. (Facts, reasons, and applicable laws) It originated in December of last year when a woman named Xu Yuying filed a lawsuit with this court, accusing Ji Juemi of seduction and abandonment. On January 15th of this year, Ji Juemi was found not guilty. At that time, someone with ulterior motives, taking advantage of the rent reduction meeting held by various organizations at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on January 16th, organized the Shanghai Municipal Various Organizations Assistance Committee for the Xu Case, nominating the defendants Ye Jiaxing, Wang Honghui, Wang Hanliang, Xue Guangqian, Li Ruzhang, as well as Zhang Yichen, Cao Zhigong, Chen Binghui, Yu Jingyu, Sun Mingqi, Zhang Dafu, Hu Yibo, Shu Huizhen, Huang Xianggu, Jiang Chiping, Shao Xubai, Zhu Yangwu, and others, 17 people in total, as committee members. From January 22nd to 27th, in various newspapers,</p>
<h3 id="e162">Published Declarations <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>as follows (the original text has appeared in various newspapers, so it is omitted). This declaration was sent by the defendant Ye Jiaxing to Yan Dingyong, the director of the advertising department of the New Sound News Agency, who forwarded it to various newspapers for publication. Among them, the phrases "because the inside story of the court is complicated, it cannot be dealt with by law," "now the court is infiltrated by special forces, and the law cannot follow its due course," "to fight for the light of justice, if people suspect that justice cannot exist today and fairness cannot pass through money, we will observe it in this movement," and other words are openly insulting to this court. The defendant Ye Jiaxing is the chairman of the committee, and he sent the draft of the declaration to the New Sound News Agency for publication, as evidenced by the testimony of Yan Dingyong. The defendant is indeed the mastermind behind the publication of this declaration. The other four defendants, Wang Honghui, Wang Hanliang, Xue Guangqian, and Li Ruzhang, also served as representatives of various organizations to</p>
<h3 id="e163">Petition in Beijing <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>They went to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to accuse the judges handling the Xu Yuying's private prosecution of Ji Juemi for obstructing morality and Ji Juemi's private prosecution of Zhang Jiping, the editor of the Shangbao, for defamation. There is an order from the Ministry to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court to investigate and reply, which is sufficient evidence that the four defendants, like Ye Jiaxing, were important members of the committee responsible for carrying out the activities. They cannot but bear significant responsibility for the declaration insulting the court. As for the remaining twelve people, Zhang Yichen, Chen Binghui, Yu Jingyu, Zhang Dafu, Hu Yibo, Shu Huizhen, Cao Zhigong, Zhu Yangwu, Huang Xianggu, Sun Mingqi, Jiang Chiping, and Shao Xubai, the fact that they were committee members was disclosed by various newspapers and confirmed by the police investigation. Whether they admit it or not, they cannot but be positively identified. However, Sun Mingqi, Jiang Chiping, and Shao Xubai</p>
<h3 id="e164">Declared Resignation <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>immediately after being elected. Moreover, based on the existing evidence, it is still difficult to prove that the above-mentioned twelve people, including Zhang Yichen, had any important relationship with the declaration that insulted the court. In addition, when this prosecutor interrogated the witness Yan Dingyong, director of the advertising department of the New Sound News Agency, in order to ascertain who sent the above-mentioned declaration for publication, he reviewed the agency's receipt stub book. However, he discovered that on the stub recording the receipt of the Xu Case Committee's declaration manuscript, the name of the person who handled it had been scratched out, making it impossible to investigate who handled and sent the declaration to the agency. Yan Dingyong is suspected of destroying evidence related to the criminal defendant of another person. However, the news agency is a commercial organization. As evidenced by the fact that when this court investigated this case, there were hundreds of people claiming to be representatives of various organizations, resembling workers, gathering in the court, shouting and causing disturbance, it is possible that Yan Dingyong scratched out the name of Ye Jiaxing, the handler, because he was being</p>

<p>and acted passively. After repeated questioning, he also confessed unequivocally that the draft of the declaration was sent by Ye Jiaxing. His criminal circumstances are indeed minor. Based on the above explanation, Ye Jiaxing, Wang Honghui, Wang Hanliang, Xue Guangqian, and Li Ruzhang have each committed the crime in Article 146, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Except that there is insufficient evidence to suspect that the twelve people Zhang Yichen, Chen Binghui, Yu Jingyu, Zhang Dafu, Hu Yibo, Shu Huizhen, Cao Zhigong, Zhu Yangwu, Huang Xianggu, Sun Mingqi, Jiang Chiping, and Shao Xubai committed a crime, and that Yan Dingyong's circumstances are minor, and they should be dismissed from prosecution separately in accordance with Article 244, Paragraph 2 and Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution should be filed in accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. It should be requested to be sentenced according to law. To the Criminal Division of this court, March 19th, Republic of China Year 23, Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court Prosecutor Zhong Qingyin.</p>

<p>Man Dies, Woman in Critical Condition</p>
<p>At the Astor House Hotel near the Garden Bridge, an American tourist arrived two days ago and booked room number 300. At approximately 8:10 PM the previous evening, the guest and a Spanish woman went to the room to drink and dine. They were talking and laughing happily at the time, showing no unusual behavior. After finishing their meal at 9:15 PM, at 10:05 PM, the guest suddenly turned pale, collapsed to the ground, and lost consciousness. The hotel waiter immediately reported to the front desk, and together with the Spanish woman, they transported the guest to the Shanghai Union Medical College Hospital for treatment. The doctor determined that he had ingested a strong poison. He died at approximately 1:00 AM yesterday morning, and the hospital notified the police. Upon seeing this situation, the Spanish woman immediately left the hospital. At approximately 9:00 AM, the woman went alone to a pharmacy on Bubbling Well Road and asked to use the telephone. Unexpectedly, when she exited, she suddenly collapsed to the ground. After hearing the news, the police dispatched detectives to the scene and transported the woman to the Shanghai Union Medical College Hospital for treatment. Examination revealed that she had also taken poison, and its toxicity was very strong, posing a threat to her life. Police investigation revealed that the deceased American man was named J. Julien, 46 years old, and had been engaged in the kerosene business in the United States, where he used fraudulent means to obtain a huge sum of millions of dollars. He was wanted by the US government. It is unknown how he managed to escape to Shanghai, where he falsely claimed to be a Canadian citizen to avoid suspicion. He initially hid in a hotel near Carter Road before moving to the Astor House Hotel. The Spanish woman was named Lecy, only 25 years old, and lived somewhere on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. The reason for their suicide is still under investigation by the police.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Japanese Consulate Police Crack Down on Mahjong Gambling <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Mahjong Gambling Spreads Throughout Japan</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai News, the police authorities of the Japanese Consulate General have noted a sharp increase in mahjong gambling among Japanese residents recently. Although they have been using various secret methods to investigate and arrest some individuals, the scope of the International Settlement is quite broad. They have created a systematic roster of people to watch, dividing them by roads, neighborhoods, and streets in the Kunshan Road area and nearby stores along the street. Surveillance is particularly strict. The reason for the surge in gambling is attributed to the poor state of the economy and the low exchange rate of the Japanese yen, which has led to an increasing number of gamblers. The authorities are particularly concerned about professional gamblers because the wives of gamblers have been reporting to the Consulate General, requesting protection. Therefore, they must strive to clean up the lives of Japanese residents to prevent them from falling into this trap. Furthermore, according to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun of the 19th, 28 people were arrested on the 17th at 6 PM for mahjong gambling involving intellectuals, celebrities, and famous artists. Figures such as the writer Kikujin Hiroshi, the famous actor Matsuzaki Tatsuo, the actress Yoshikawa Mitsuko, and the son of General Inuya, Masao, were all prosecuted for gambling. At the same time, cases of mahjong gambling are being discovered successively in Osaka and Yokohama, indicating a trend of spreading throughout the country.</p>

<p>| 42 Male and Female Gamblers Arrested |</p>
<p>In house number 18, Zhangjia Lane, Xinzhao Zhou Road, Gaochang Temple, Nanshi, a Wuxi man named Deng Genrong secretly established a gambling den, colluding with fellow gamblers such as Deng Sanqing to lure workers from the Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochang Temple and employees from nearby shops to gamble. They played Pai Gow and dice day and night, with Deng skimming profits. This was discovered by Shen Wenda of the City Public Security Bureau's investigation unit, who reported to Captain Lu and District Chief Li of the Second District, who immediately dispatched a large number of male and female detectives, all in disguise, along with police officers, to take a motor vehicle to house number 18, Zhangjia Lane at approximately 1:00 AM yesterday morning. They surrounded the front and back doors, and the officers stormed into the gambling den, arresting the gambling boss Deng Genrong, as well as Chen Ayou, Deng Sanqing, Wang Yiqin, Wu Shigen, Wang Yunlong, Zhu Kuiyuan, Huang Jinsheng, Meng Hongzhou, Xie Dagou, Huang Ergou, Wang Qiaoxiang, Li Tiansheng, Ma Nansheng, Deng Hongji, Xie Jinsheng, Zhang Songshan, Qiu Dehe, Zheng Guisheng, Li Shutang, Xie Zhenyin, Gu Xianggen, Ju Yunqing, Ma Dafu, Shi Yuqing, Zhu Yuquan, Wang Yongquan, Meng Heguang, Shi Hanqing, Ou Shoufu, Cao A'er, Wang Guan'gen, Xie Gengeng, Chen Linsheng, Chen Afu, He Yingyuan, Zhao Wenfu, Zhou Xirong, Zhou Qian, Jiang Chaosheng, Wang Sunshi, Chen Tangshi, and others, totaling 42 men and women.

<p>Chen Rongsheng Dies of Heart Disease</p>
<p>Zhang Qifu Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment</p>
<p>The Chinese and Western detectives of the Second Group of the French Concession Police's Special Unit, together with the Chengdu Road Police, arrested the major robbers Xu Guifa, Chen Rongsheng, Chen Jinchang, Zhang Qifu, Zhang Guibin, Chen Kejian, and suspects Chen Qiaorong, Yin Tiancheng, the woman Chen Ge, the woman Chen Shi, and the woman Huang Linmei, totaling 13 men and women, at No. 228 and a half Foch Road and No. 18 Tianyou Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei, on the afternoon of January 30th of this year. They seized five pistols, bullets, and stolen banknotes amounting to more than 400 yuan. They discovered that the bandits had committed six robbery cases in the French Concession and many cases in the International Settlement, including the robbery of five diamond rings and a pistol from guests at a brothel on Shantou Road and two murder cases on the evening of January 12th of this year, as well as major cases such as the robbery of the Chinese Bank escort funds and pistols from the Huain and Indian police and the victims' families in Nanshi last year. The Second Special District Court filed a public prosecution. Except for the five male and female suspects who were not prosecuted by the police and were released in court, the cases of the seven bandits including Xu had been declared closed by the court on the 21st of this month, and the sentencing was scheduled for the 28th (the day after tomorrow). Xu and the other bandits were held in the McTyeire Station of the Louza Police, awaiting sentencing. Among them, Chen Rongsheng, 26 years old, from Yangzhou, died in custody of heart disease at 7:00 PM on the 23rd. The police sent the body to the morgue for examination. The next day, the Second Special Court dispatched personnel to confirm the cause of death. Because there were no family members, the body was embalmed and buried by the mortuary. Another suspect, Zhang Qifu, 36 years old, also fell ill in custody. At approximately 1:00 PM on the 24th, the police sent him to the Kwong Wah Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, Zhang felt guilty upon arriving at the hospital and, taking advantage of the inattention of others that evening, tore a bed sheet into strips and twisted them into a rope. He used the excuse of needing to defecate in the toilet, where he hanged himself on the iron rod of the flushing toilet. He was discovered by the guard at 1:00 AM that night, but he had already died. The police were immediately notified and dispatched detectives to transport the body to the Tung Jen Foo Yuen Funeral Home for examination, pending a court-ordered inspection today. It is reported that the deceased was the brother of Chen Rongsheng, who had died previously. After committing the crime, he changed his name. Now, knowing that he had committed too many crimes and that his life could not escape the law, he committed suicide out of fear of punishment. It is also reported that the police, in order to be cautious and prevent other thieves from following suit, have dispatched patrol officers to guard them closely and added handcuffs to prevent further unexpected events.</p>

<p>The wife of a Ningbo man surnamed Wang, residing at house number 271, Datong Road, was pregnant for ten full months and suddenly went into labor a few days ago. The fetus was difficult to deliver, so she was sent to the Hongkou Pingmin Maternity Hospital for treatment. It was diagnosed as a difficult labor, and the pregnant woman was physically weak, which was very dangerous. After performing the operation, a boy was delivered. His body and head were small, as if not fully formed, but his hands were unusually large. His skin color was bright red like hot coal. He cried loudly and lived for eight hours. This deformed development is thought to be due to congenital deficiency.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Cigarette Association Review Committee Unanimously Approves Tax System Improvement <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Current System Causes National Loss of 40 Million</p>
<p>And Violates the Cigarette Consolidated Tax Regulations</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News, the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, based on the petition submitted by 24 Chinese-owned cigarette factories to modify the current two-tier tax rate system, sent a letter to the Cigarette Factory Trade Association for discussion. The Trade Association also designated six people, including Huang Ziping, Lao Jingxiu, Jing Yimeng, Ding Boquan, Zhao Lingshao, and Zhang Xinliang, to form a committee to review the matter in detail. The review report submitted by the review committee is recorded below. The case of the 24 cigarette companies, including Minzhong, requesting the improvement of the current cigarette tax rate system has now been submitted by the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance to the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Trade Association for reply. Ziping and others were publicly elected by the general meeting as review committee members and, after holding a meeting, determined that the current two-tier cigarette tax rate system actually favors the British-American Tobacco Company, and the Chinese government, cigarette merchants, and tobacco farmers all suffer losses. From various arguments, there is no room for it to stand. Details are described separately below: (A) The losses suffered by the Chinese government, cigarette merchants, and tobacco farmers after the implementation of the two-tier cigarette tax. (1) Loss of Consolidated Tax. The original proposal stated that during the three-tier tax era, British-American Tobacco Company sold 30,472 stamps. During the two-tier tax era, they sold 48,808 stamps. Each box of cigarettes is affixed with one stamp according to regulations, comparing an increase of 18,336 boxes, an increase of more than 50%. If taxes were still collected according to the three-tier tax rate, without any increase or decrease, tax revenue should have increased by 50%. An investigation revealed that during the three-tier tax era, the British-American Tobacco Company paid an average monthly tax of over 2.41 million yuan. If increased by 50%, it would be over 3.61 million yuan. However, in reality, during the two-tier tax era, British-American Tobacco Company only paid an average monthly tax of over 2.72 million yuan, a decrease of over 890,000 yuan per month, and a decrease of over 10.68 million yuan annually. The committee's review confirms this. Therefore, after the implementation of the two-tier tax, the loss of consolidated tax is over 10.68 million yuan annually. (2) Loss of Customs Duty. After the implementation of the two-tier tax, the tax on high-end cigarettes was reduced, and the customs duty was changed to collecting the full amount in gold units, which was heavier than before. In order to avoid customs duties, the British-American Tobacco Company moved the production of high-end cigarettes such as Three Castles and Hong Xibao to factories in Shanghai. Therefore, after 1932, customs revenue on cigarettes decreased sharply compared to before. According to the Customs Trade Statistics Yearbook and the Customs Import Tariff, after investigation and statistics, the customs tax revenue on paper cigarettes decreased by 4,964,960 gold units in 1932, equivalent to 9,929,920 silver yuan. In 1933, the decrease was as high as 5,858,398 gold units, equivalent to 11,716,796 silver yuan. This is the loss of customs duty after the implementation of the two-tier tax (calculated at two silver yuan per gold unit). (3) Loss of Chinese Merchants. The proposal stated that during the three-tier tax era, other cigarette companies sold 68,422 stamps. During the two-tier tax era, they sold 44,323 stamps, comparing a decrease of 24,099 boxes, a decrease of about one-third. If taxes were still collected according to the three-tier tax rate, without any increase or decrease, tax revenue should have decreased by one-third. An investigation revealed that during the three-tier tax era, other cigarette companies paid an average monthly tax of over 2 million yuan. If decreased by one-third, it would be over 1.34 million yuan. However, in reality, during the two-tier tax era, they paid an average monthly tax of over 2.55 million yuan, an increase of over 1.21 million yuan per month, and an increase of 14.52 million yuan annually. The committee's review confirms this. The loss of Chinese merchants in terms of tax payments, as well as the loss of business, the loss of workers, and the loss of equipment, are not even counted. (4) Loss of Tobacco Farmers. The investigation revealed that the native tobacco leaves produced in places such as Susong, Huanggang, Xinchang, Dengzhou, Champion, Guangshui, and Junzhou used to sell approximately 390,000 bundles annually. Since the implementation of the two-tier tax, only 115,000 bundles are sold annually, a decrease of 275,000 bundles. Each bundle weighs approximately 250 pounds, totaling 68,750,000 pounds. The average selling price is 7.5 yuan per 100 pounds, totaling 5.15 million silver yuan. This is the loss of tobacco farmers after the implementation of the two-tier tax. (5) Loss of Native Tobacco Leaf Tax. As mentioned in the previous section, the annual decrease in sales of native tobacco leaves is 275,000 bundles, totaling 68,750,000 pounds. According to the current tax rate of 4.15 yuan per 100 catties, there is a shortfall of over 2.59 million yuan. This is the loss of the native tobacco leaf tax after the implementation of the two-tier tax. The total loss nationwide due to these five items is 44,465,679 yuan. (B) The benefits enjoyed by the British-American Tobacco Company after the implementation of the two-tier cigarette tax. (1) According to the loss of consolidated tax in item (A)(1), the British-American Tobacco Company enjoys the benefit of reduced tax on high-end cigarettes in consolidated tax, totaling 10.68 million yuan annually. (2) According to the loss of customs duty in item (A)(2), the British-American Tobacco Company accounts for about 80% of imported cigarettes, avoiding customs duties of over 8.8 million yuan annually. (3) According to item (A)(1), the British-American Tobacco Company increased its sales of cigarettes by 18,336 boxes per month during the two-tier tax era. At a profit of 10 yuan per box, the business profit is at least over 180,000 yuan, totaling 2.16 million yuan annually. If considering the high-end cigarettes such as Three Castles, which sell for over 1,200 yuan per box, the profit would be many times greater. In summary, the lowest benefit received by the British-American Tobacco Company after the implementation of the two-tier tax is over 21.64 million yuan. The benefits received by foreign tobacco farmers due to the increased sales of American tobacco leaves and the increased foreign tobacco tax are not even counted. (C) The two-tier cigarette tax has no basis in various arguments. (1) No basis in comparison of customs duties. Customs duties are levied on goods imported from abroad, and consolidated taxes are levied on goods manufactured domestically. The two are different and complementary. Customs duties have been in place for decades and have more experience. There is also a tariff committee that conducts thorough research on tax rates. Therefore, customs duties are the best reference for consolidated taxes. An examination of the customs import tariff for paper cigarettes reveals the following tax rates: (A) Over 20 gold units per thousand cigarettes and unmarked cigarettes: 10.6 gold units per thousand. (B) Over 15 gold units per thousand cigarettes, but not over 20 gold units: 8.7 per thousand. (C) Over 10 gold units per thousand cigarettes, but not over 15 gold units: 7.2 per thousand. (D) Over 7.5 gold units per thousand cigarettes, but not over 10 gold units: 5.3 per thousand. (E) Over 5 gold units per thousand cigarettes, but not over 7.5 gold units: 3.9 per thousand. (F) Over 2.5 gold units per thousand cigarettes, but not over 5 gold units: 2.2 per thousand. (G) 2.5 gold units per thousand cigarettes or less: 1.3 per thousand. From the above table, it can be seen that customs duties have three different points for paper cigarettes: (1) Customs duties are divided into seven levels, which is very precise. Consolidated taxes are only divided into two levels, which is too crude. (2) Customs duties from level B to level G are generally 50% of the value, which is very fair. The second level of consolidated tax, 80 yuan is levied on each box below 300 yuan, and 20 yuan is allowed in non-manufacturing areas. Therefore, high-end cigarettes priced around 300 yuan are taxed at only 36% of their value, while low-end cigarettes priced at 120 yuan are taxed at 126% of their value, which is topsy-turvy. (3) Level A of customs duties is generally 80% of the value, far exceeding the other six levels. The first level of consolidated tax is 160 yuan per box, only about 50% of the value. Compared with the 120% of the value for low-end cigarettes, it is still guilty of reversing the order of importance. (2) No basis in legislation. Article 3 of the Cigarette Consolidated Tax Regulations stipulates that for all goods manufactured in factories within the country, the competent authority should use the customs valuation as a standard and pay 32.5% of the cigarette consolidated tax. According to the interpretation of this regulation, the customs valuation should be used as a standard, that is, levied according to the seven levels. Paying a certain percentage of the consolidated tax is taxing according to value. The current two-tier tax rate system forcibly changes the seven levels to two levels and sets the 300-yuan selling price as a standard, rather than taxing according to value, which violates the basic principles of the regulations. (3) No basis in business conditions. When the three-tier tax was changed to the two-tier tax in 1932, cigarette factories in various provinces opposed it. In 1933, when the current tax rate was revised, Chinese merchants opposed it even more strongly. On February 9th of this year, the members of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Trade Association unanimously advocated modifying the current two-tier tax rate at the general meeting, which is obviously a common view that it violates business conditions. (4) No basis in taxation principles. There are three important principles of taxation: (1) Meeting the needs of national finance. After the implementation of the two-tier tax, the government loses more than 10 million yuan in consolidated tax, more than 11 million yuan in customs duties, and 2.5 million yuan in native tobacco leaf tax. It cannot meet the needs of national finance. (2) Promoting the development of the social economy. After the implementation of the two-tier tax, the number of Chinese cigarette factories that went bankrupt accounted for two-thirds, the number of Chinese cigarette sales decreased by one-third, and the number of native tobacco leaf sales decreased by two-thirds. Not only can it not promote the development of the social economy, but it also oppresses the country's agriculture and commerce, leading to decline. (3) Adapting to the people's ability to bear the burden. Before the two-tier tax, the number of cigarette sales increased by 10% annually. Since the three-tier tax was changed, it has decreased by 10% annually. Moreover, during the seven-tier tax and three-tier tax eras, there were not many smuggled cigarettes, and there was no need for investigation. After the two-tier tax was changed, smuggled cigarettes were rampant, indicating that the current tax rate cannot adapt to the people's ability to bear the burden. (5) Refuting the fallacy of eliminating small factories. Some may say that the financial authorities, for the convenience of collecting consolidated taxes, decided to eliminate small factories. The current tax rate supports large factories and suppresses small factories, which is the policy of the government and does not allow merchants to oppose it. Alas, where did this anti-Party policy, this policy of national subjugation, come from? The Principle of People's Livelihood emphasizes the regulation of capital. Supporting large factories and suppressing small factories means supporting large capital and suppressing small capital. Judging from the Principle of People's Livelihood, it is greatly contradictory. Moreover, the British-American Tobacco Company is the largest cigarette factory in the country, and the others are all Chinese merchants. Since the implementation of this two-tier tax to eliminate small factories, the number of Chinese businesses has decreased from 150 to 160 to 40 to 50. Factories of the fourth and fifth grades no longer exist. The survivors are only first, second, and third-grade cigarette factories. The current tax rate, the second level of selling price, is relaxed to 300 yuan. In non-manufacturing areas, it can be relaxed to 320 yuan. This is a gradual advance in the policy of eliminating small factories. If this remains unchanged, the first, second, and third-grade Chinese merchant cigarette factories will be eliminated in turn. The ultimate goal is to only have the trust-style British-American Tobacco Company. Chinese merchant factories and machinery have become fixed assets. Closing down means death, and not advancing also means death. The capital of each factory, the largest is no more than 10 million yuan, and the smallest is only tens of thousands of yuan. In any case, it is not enough to compete with the British-American Tobacco Company with tens of millions of capital. If this policy of supporting large capital does not change, we can only watch millions of Chinese merchant capital being rolled into the pockets of the British and Americans in turn. The British-American Tobacco Company is nodding and smiling, but it is not understood what convenience the government has in eliminating small factories, and it is willing to sacrifice millions of Chinese merchant capital to foreigners without regret. (6) Refuting the fallacy of only taxing cigarettes heavily in terms of taxes. Some may say that the number of cigarette sales is the largest for low-end cigarettes, so the government has to tax low-end cigarettes heavily in terms of taxes. Alas, this is a deceptive statement. The seven tax rates set by the Cigarette Consolidated Tax Regulations and the current tax rates are listed separately to prove that during the seven-tier tax era, the highest tax was the first level, with a tax of 404 yuan per box, and the lowest was the seventh level, with a tax of 29 yuan per box. The current tax rate, the lowest tax rate of the second level, is 80 yuan per box, which is almost three times the 29.25 yuan per box of the seventh level during the seven-tier tax era. If high-end cigarettes also had the same increase, then the tax on first-grade cigarettes should be more than 1,100 yuan per box, but the current tax rate for first-grade cigarettes is only 160 yuan. If the government values tax revenue, why is it abandoning this 900 yuan high-end cigarette tax? This is still referring to the first level. The fourth level is 136 yuan per box. If there is the same increase, it should be more than 400 yuan. The number of sales of fourth-level cigarettes is not small. Why is this difference of more than 200 yuan abandoned? The total amount of tax abandoned reaches 12 million yuan annually, and the beneficiary is the British-American Tobacco Company. In terms of our country's current financial situation, can we still tax cigarettes heavily? Why doesn't our patriotic government investigate this? (7) The fallacy of not changing the 80-yuan tax rate. Some may say, as you suggested, can the lowest tax rate be 80 yuan and then increase according to the seven levels? Alas, this is a disruptive policy. The lowest-priced cigarettes cannot bear the heavy tax of 80 yuan. This is why Chinese merchants are collapsing one after another, and this is why cigarette factories across the country are strongly opposed to it. If this is taken as a fixed rate and increased according to the levels, then the entire cigarette industry will not be able to bear the burden and will have to close down completely. Those who made this statement knew that it was not feasible, so the reason for holding this view was to cause a wave of opposition in the entire cigarette industry and prevent the modification of the tax rate that harms China and benefits foreigners. This must be clearly distinguished. From this point of view, the two-tier tax has hundreds of harms and no benefits in fact and in theory. At the beginning of the reform, merchants and people in various places opposed it, and the Ministry of Finance used trial operation as an excuse and did not allow modification. For the past two years, the industry has felt such deep pain in this fiery situation that it is difficult to try for a long time. The Cigarette Consolidated Tax Regulations were promulgated by the National Government. Article 3 of the regulations stipulates that for all goods manufactured in factories within the country, the competent authority should use the customs valuation as a standard and pay 32.5% of the cigarette consolidated tax, which is very fair. Using the customs valuation as a standard means dividing it into seven levels. Calculating the tax according to a certain percentage means taxing according to value. The seven-tier system and taxing according to value were the previous cigarette consolidated tax, the current customs duties, and the current cigar tax, which are better than the current cigarette tax, which is arbitrarily determined and has no standards. What we are requesting from the government now is to handle matters in accordance with the Cigarette Consolidated Tax Regulations that have been promulgated by the government and are effective, without breaking the promulgated tax law. If it is said that there is a financial deficit and funds must be raised, relief can be sought in the law, and the amount can be increased to 42.5% or 52.5%. How can we break the fair seven-tier system and the principle of taxing according to value? It is suggested that if the government wants to be cautious, it can organize a committee to review the cigarette tax rate, with several committee members from the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Tax Affairs Department, and several committee members elected by the Chinese Cigarette Factory Trade Association, gathering together for open discussion, striving to determine a perfect tax rate. On the one hand, it can meet the needs of the government's finances, and on the other hand, it can promote the development of the social economy and adapt to the people's ability to bear the burden. If the government acts impartially, merchants and people will not hesitate to increase the burden and will be happy to have open discussions. As for the various points mentioned in the official letter from the tax department, the original proposal provides detailed answers and will not be repeated. The committee has repeatedly discussed the above sections and has the same opinions. Now, a written opinion is jointly submitted, along with the attached proposal, hoping to forward it to the Tax Affairs Department for early improvement, so that the industry can emerge from the fire and ascend to the throne. This is our heartfelt prayer.</p>

<h3 id="e181">How to Research the Northeast Problem (6) <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Above, we have roughly discussed the various opposing groups. The summary of the entire problem will be completed today. The editor hopes that readers will keep the final, unnecessary addition to this article in mind. It is better to memorize the entire article. We await your criticism. - Editor</p>
<p>In short, the Northeast problem should be viewed as such and analyzed and understood through the intersection of these three opposing groups to truly recognize its essence. As for what our content of resisting Japan and opposing imperialism is, and how we can take on this important historical mission, we should naturally first liquidate past erroneous ideas and correctly recognize the essence of the problem.</p>
<p>The editor is extremely ashamed and can only offer a research outline, ending here. Because the space for this column cannot allow this issue to continue to be discussed, superficial and incomplete points are inevitable. However, for Mr. Fang, if there is even one point of benefit in the method of researching the Northeast problem, then that would be the editor's honor.</p>
<p>However, the editor still cannot refrain from speaking. Mr. Fang is a youth from the Northeast and naturally cares more about the Northeast than other places. However, according to Mr. Fang's letter, it seems that recently Mr. Fang has been burying himself in studying the Northeast in his strategy to save the country. After writing this short article, the editor cannot help but feel empty. I think that after Mr. Fang reads this letter, even if he agrees with what the editor has said and does the same, if he only limits himself to abstract research, he will definitely be greatly disappointed. Therefore, the editor cannot help but add a bit of unnecessary advice, sincerely telling Mr. Fang.</p>
<p>The crisis of the Chinese nation has reached a new stage today. The resolution of the Northeast problem and your glorious return to your hometown are probably impossible in the next year or two! Studying the Northeast problem now goes beyond some of the things the editor has proposed. The Northeast problem already has a correct scientific conclusion. It has told the Chinese masses that this is a problem of the entire national liberation, a problem of the entire national revolutionary movement against imperialism, feudalism, and indigenous capital. You can only reach this conclusion by studying it partially, and it cannot have a second conclusion. If you study a scale or claw in more detail, that is a behavior that wastes one's ambition, and it will definitely be despised by passionate young people. For your sake, in my humble opinion, studying the Northeast problem should be about using scientific methods to study how to organize popular forces, expand the volunteer army, how to raise the awareness of the masses in resisting Japan and opposing imperialism, organize the masses, how to study guerrilla warfare and all tactics, how to set up a cultural front against Japan, imperialism, and puppets, how to destroy all the enemy's material and spiritual constructions, how to expose the ugliness and sins of traitors and high-ranking Chinese, how to obtain the support of the national masses and friendly forces around the world. All of this cannot be studied in a study room, cannot be fantasized while living in a Western-style building in Shanghai. You must truly return to the "heated kang" (炕, a heated brick bed), unite with many passionate and righteous people, and go to the masses. You should trust those "ignorant commoners," only they are the true main force in resisting imperialism. Some of them are now dominated by the consciousness of traitors and enemies, and you should overcome them. You cannot be discouraged, you should not be passive! Even if the Japanese are now exerting high pressure, and the people's spirit is declining, we should start from the beginning. Moreover, the current situation is not as bad as you might imagine. Mr. Fang! Mr. Fang! As I write this, I cannot help but feel my mind flying beyond the borders.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that Mr. Fang and the Northeast exiles will seriously offer opinions and criticisms on our discussion to encourage each other. If you can accept the above suggestions with action, then the editor's words will not have been in vain.</p>
<p>History is created by mankind themselves. The resolution of the Northeast problem, the liberation of the Chinese nation, all depend on ourselves, and the result of this liberation war will inevitably be our victory. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e182">Suicide <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>A person will never take their own life unless absolutely necessary. Suicide is truly the end of the road in life! One wonders what kind of sorrow they hold in their hearts? I recently saw a dispatch from the Japanese Associated Press, which said: "Tokyo: According to investigations by the authorities, the number of suicides in Japan has been increasing recently. Last year, there were 2,551 suicides in Tokyo Prefecture (including 1,052 women). On average, seven men and women were busy committing suicide every day, an increase of 194 people compared to the previous year's statistics. The suicide rate is highest in spring and lowest in winter, with a spring-to-winter ratio of ten to six. The most common reasons for suicide are pessimism and illness, followed by romantic entanglement and financial difficulties, and then mental disorder and family discord. However, the majority are due to economic reasons. Suicides are more common among young people with a sense of gratitude. There were 498 young men and women under the age of 20 who abandoned their future and chose the path of death, and 1,146 people between the ages of 20 and 30." Looking at their statistics, how do the suicides in our country compare to theirs? Every day, when I read the newspapers, the news about suicides is what catches my attention the most, because I really like to study the reasons behind them. In Shanghai alone, there are at least three suicides every day, according to the statistics from the last month. There are also suicides that happen in other locations, like cities or towns, that do not even make into the newspaper. If a precise annual statistic could be made, the number of suicides would exceed the suicide numbers of Japan by a large margin!</p>
<p>However, the reason for suicides in our country is, to 70% is due to economic oppression, not being able to make a living for themselves, and being forced to use the policy of suicide. Especially in the present-day context of bankruptcy of the rural sector, the numbers of people who are committing suicide has increased exponentially compared to the previous years. Even in our tiny towns, this month there have been seven people committing suicide due to dire environmental reasons! However, in the newspapers there have been no mentions of the suicides. If other smaller places can report the numbers using the same ratio, the statistics would be shocking.</p>
<p>The youth of this day has seen life as too trivial; I often have the thought in my head: "Feeling that a hundred years of life would ultimately end in death." However, it is rare to live to 70. When I bring up these words at home, it has caused my kind mother to rebuke me. It's unwelcome. My old lady said: "The young people of this day should be in society doing great things!" "Even though life is short, like the dew of the morning, it is in the short process that effort should be redoubled to make things for the society and the nation, to leave behind a model for the younger generations!" Truly, one must not become too decayed! Still go towards the future! Fight on!</p>
<h3 id="e183">Piggy Bank <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>When I was a child, I would get a few coins and buy a piggy bank to save them up. When it was full, I would break it open and string the coins together with a rope, or exchange them for silver dollars. If I got silver dollars, the joy I felt at that time was truly indescribable. When I tell these things to my children, they laugh at me, thinking that I have a narrow view. Because they don't care about a few copper coins now, let alone small change. When they get copper coins, they immediately spend them. Who would be patient enough to save them? So piggy banks have gradually been phased out. I don't think this thing is bad. Although you can break it open as soon as it's not full, it's still a bit more trouble than putting it in your pocket. If you can develop a habit, from not breaking it open until it's full, to not breaking it open even when it's full, accumulating day by day, there will definitely be an unexpected harvest at some point. Even though it doesn't earn interest, it does cultivate the capital.</p>
<p>However, the Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital record that Zou Changqian tied a piggy bank to a letter to Duke Gongsun, saying: "A piggy bank is a vessel made of earth to store money. It has an opening for money to enter, but no opening for money to exit. When it is full, it is broken open. Earth is a coarse material; money is an important loan. It enters but does not exit, accumulates but does not scatter, so it is broken open. Earth has the characteristic of gathering but not scattering, so there will be a failure of the piggy bank. Can it not be tested?" Therefore, it has the name "niggardly purse." This idea is certainly not wrong, but the virtue of thrift in children is different from hoarding and accumulating wealth. We still believe that piggy banks are a gift for children.</p>
<p>I associated with this 'full' word. The revolution of the Xinhai can be said that the piggy bank has achieved success. Who knew that after twenty-three years, the piggy bank would be revived. Behind him there is someone to support him, it is difficult to beat him down so quickly. Most Japanese goods are loose and easily broken. I don't know if the piggy bank, which has a registered Japanese trademark, is like other Japanese goods. We have to test the strength of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3 id="e184">In Memory of Mr. Yan Wanzhi <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Xiang</p>
<p>When I saw the news of Mr. Wanzhi's passing in the newspaper, I couldn't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>When I was a senior in high school at the Minli School two years ago, Mr. Yan was also there as a translation professor. Although I was only his student for a short year, the impression he left on me was so deep! He was a learned, kind, and humorous old man. Old but not too old, but his head was full of white hair, and his body was unusually large. At the time, I thought: this is not a sign of health!</p>
<p>Mr. Yan's voice was very hoarse. When he was teaching, he always used a lot of strength to shout loudly, and the veins on both sides of his temples were always very thick. While he was lecturing, his hand never stopped writing on the blackboard; when the class was over, his mandarin jacket was covered in white chalk powder.</p>
<p>One morning, he probably didn't have breakfast. After class, he went to the school store to buy a sesame cake for five copper coins. This frugal habit of his, not disliking coarse grains, was how deeply it aroused my respect at the time!</p>
<p>But in that year of teacher-student relationship, he never knew me. Now, his spirit in heaven probably wouldn't know that there was such a student who secretly respected him, weeping and mourning for him.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Six: Generously Pours Out His Heart to Serve the Country, Forgetting His Home; Sadly Faces the Jade Mirror, Sighing for the One He Loves</p>
<p>Wang Shi forgot himself and reached out to firmly shake Ziqiang's hand, shaking it a few times and saying: "Company Commander Zhao, you are a real man, I admire you." Ziqiang shook his head and said: "I don't want to go home anymore, I don't want to go home anymore. The troops have already marched out of the Great Wall, what's the point of wanting to go home?" As he was shouting, Tian Qing called out from outside the door: "Old Zhao, what are you shouting about? Complaining again?" As he spoke, he poked his head in through the cracks of the sorghum stalk curtain. Ziqiang laughed and said: "What's with all this sneaking around?" Tian Qing leaned in and pulled out a rose-colored foreign paper envelope from his pocket, waving it at Ziqiang and laughing: "Writing a letter, can I borrow your fountain pen?" Ziqiang laughed: "Sleeping is on a dirt kang, eating is mixed noodles, but you can't forget that Miss Huang in your heart." Tian Qing said: "Old Taoist, are you upset? You cough and sigh all day and night, constantly saying you're sorry to your new wife, how can we not be at peace when we write a letter?" As he said, he pulled out a large handful of envelopes, big and small, from his pocket, held them up high, and laughed: "Although I sleep on a pile of sorghum stalks, I say it's a down mattress. Although I eat mixed noodles, I say it's lamb dumplings. Why? Because these things comfort me." Zhao Ziqiang said: "Company Commander Tian, let's not joke around. I've long since put away that bit of affection you're holding onto. What did the battalion commander just tell us? To tell you the truth, from now on, I've made a 120-point determination not to miss my home." Then he repeated the words he had just said to Sergeant Wang Shi. Tian Qing's face turned red at first, and he didn't reply. Then he grabbed Ziqiang's hand and said: "Company Commander Zhao, you're right, I won't write love letters anymore. It's useless to write them anyway. Even if I write a thousand kisses, ten thousand kisses, no one actually kisses anyone, and it just makes my heart feel uneasy all day." As the two of them were talking inside, someone outside interjected: "What's the point of missing home? What's the point of missing women? Without these things, I, Guan Dage, wouldn't have ended up in this situation today." (345)</p>
<h3 id="e186">Study of Inkstones (9) <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Bored Guest</p>
<p>General Overview of the Duan Inkstone</p>
<p>B. Fish Brain Jelly: In beautiful patterns, there are some that are round like the moon reflected in a clear pool, called "fish brain jelly." Those that are scattered and sparse are called "broken jelly." The History of Inkstones says that jelly is the condensation of water and fat. If it is as white as clear clouds and seems to disperse when blown, or as loose as a ball of cotton and seems to rise when touched, it is not a superior grade. If it is as pure white as ice and snow, and as lively as broken cotton, it is called "broken jelly," which is also good. Moreover, the circumference of fish brain jelly must have fire marks, or crimson halo, or money marks, or horse tail patterns surrounding it. If there is a blue-white aura rising above the mark, it is called "flame blue." This is only found in the Great Western Cave. Other colors with a yellow tint are secondary, and those with a gray-brown color or that are solid and not loose are inferior.</p>
<p>Two. Banana Leaf White: Banana leaf white is considered superior if it is like a newly unfolded banana leaf with dew about to drip. Pure and clean ones are secondary. This is Shi Hua's judgment. The Book of Inkstones says: Banana leaf white is a complete piece, tender and pure like soft muscles, like congealed fat, warm and lustrous, sinking and dense. When you look at it, it seems deep and faint, as if you can see inside. Only the Water Cliff is like this. The Wide Language says: Banana leaf white is the tender part of the stone, formed by the essence, so its color is white. If it is a pure and clean piece with slight blue flowers, like dense autumn clouds or like subtle ripples, it must be the elite of the Duanxi. The Stone Hermit's Inkstone Talk says it even more clearly, saying, "Stone properties are moist and purplish, dry and gray-blue. The plum blossom rocks and other stones produced recently are mostly gray-white. This is the natural color of the stone, and blind people mistakenly think it is banana leaf white. Banana leaf white must have fire marks around it, (same as the fish brain jelly mentioned above). You must know that the beauty of banana leaf white does not have to be pure and complete, but must be moist and divine." Then the shape of banana leaf white can be imagined, but how many types of banana leaf white are there? The ancients said that the banana white of the old pit is pure white like fish meat, the banana white of the west cave is slightly red like bloody sheep liver, the banana white of the main cave is slightly purple like newly ripe grapes, and the banana white of the new pit is slightly black like wet green bricks. The Japanese therefore estimated that there are five types:</p>
<p>(1) Pure, without impurities, slightly blue, like a newly unfolded banana leaf with dew about to drip, is the most superior;</p>
<p>(2) Pure white, like fresh shark fins;</p>
<p>(3) Slightly red, like sheep liver;</p>
<p>(4) Slightly purple, like newly ripe grapes;</p>
<p>(5) Slightly black, like wet green bricks.</p>
<p>Based on the above, it can be seen that its color and name are also very complicated, and large ones are especially difficult to obtain. Tokyo's Ono Zhongshan is also a Japanese scholar of Duan stones. He once said, "Banana white is very rare. From my experience, let alone a large one, even a small inkstone of two or three inches with the entire ink pool in banana leaf white is absolutely impossible to find." The value of banana leaf white can be known.</p>
<p>I used to collect an old inkstone left by Mr. Lu Yanshan. The color is similar to newly ripe grapes, and Ding Jingqi of Shanghai titled it "Han Pattern Banana Leaf White." When did the name "Han Pattern" begin? Do the predecessors have any records of this? I would like to ask this of those who share the same hobby as me.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Anecdotes of John Leighton Stuart <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>On the occasion of John Leighton Stuart's 70th birthday, students and colleagues held a grand celebration at Yenching University. The excitement was unprecedented, perhaps the first of its kind for a foreigner founding a school in China.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that John Leighton Stuart was the president of Yenching University for fifty years, but few know that when he came to China from America, he did not immediately go to Yenching University in Shanghai. When he was in his twenties, he first went to Jiading. Outside the West Gate of Jiading, there was a church called "American Presbyterian Mission." That was the name used at the time, which is probably the present-day Episcopal Church, only the transliteration is different. He lived in the church for more than two years, studying Chinese language and writing, and became quite proficient. That is why the two school mottoes hanging in the school to this day, "Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous," are evidence of his study of Chinese Confucianism. Sometimes, when students wanted to commemorate Confucius' birthday, he could even take the stage and give a speech on the chapter "Be loyal, trustworthy in word, and earnest and respectful in deed," which was built upon the foundation he laid in Jiading.</p>
<p>His wife, now Mrs. Stuart, is actually his second wife. His first wife was not a Western beauty, but a Shanghai native surnamed Huang, named Su'e. This Miss Huang first studied at the Church of Our Savior in Hongkou. She was extraordinarily intelligent and good at playing the piano, so at that time, she was considered a unique pioneer in Chinese women's circles. Dr. Stuart would always rush from Fanwangdu to attend church services on Sundays to participate in prayers. Later, he wanted to propose to Miss Huang, but the social atmosphere was not yet open, and it was extremely difficult to achieve this happy wish. He sent more than a hundred letters before receiving a reply, and they finally became husband and wife. Very few people know about this now. Before the European War, Dr. Stuart had three sons who all joined the front lines. In front of his house, there was also a flag of honor hanging, with three stars embroidered on the corner of the flag, indicating that his three sons were all fighting and killing the enemy amidst the artillery fire. In fact, these three good sons were born to Miss Huang Su'e of Shanghai. He also has a daughter who still lives in the United States, remaining single to this day. After Ms. Huang passed away, presumably when she was middle-aged, Dr. Stuart remained a widower for nearly twenty years before marrying Mrs. Coe, a female teacher at the school, continuing a beautiful relationship. In the eyes of Chinese people, this seems rare, but in their customs, it is not unusual, and it was even approved by the bishop!</p>
<p>He is in charge of everything in the school, and everyone knows that he has the perseverance to achieve today's position. In fact, his principle is that running education is a career for everyone, without distinguishing between Chinese and foreigners. Therefore, he has been working hard for decades, holding the spirit of a lifetime to devote himself to it. Although he sometimes encounters headwinds and raging tides, like unpredictable attacks, he always maintains a calm attitude, and soon it will pass peacefully without incident. He treats students with strictness mixed with respect. When classes are in session, if it is in the morning, he sometimes comes to take a look. Students can hear the sound of his leather shoes from afar, "Tap! Tap!" Everyone knows that "Old Man Stuart" is coming (students call him by his nickname), and even the general teachers have to be more cautious. This is really his incomparable point.</p>
<p>There are also a few jokes. When Dr. Stuart was in Jiading, there was a bean curd shop founded by a Huainan native in the American Presbyterian Mission. When he first saw this clean, white bean curd, he was surprised and thought it a rare treasure. After tasting it, he was amazed and considered it the only nourishing food, never forgetting it at every meal. Later, when he saw how it was made, he was frightened and dared not eat it anymore. To this day, two tofu shop owners can still remember this joke, considering it a memory of Dr. Stuart in Jiading! The oldest in the history of Yenching University is Mr. Yan Yongjin, the father of the current Ambassador Yan Huiqing, which is the meaning of the Thinking of Yan Hall in the school. At this time, Dr. Stuart was naturally among the younger generation. Once during the New Year, he followed our Chinese customs, wearing a red satin hat and black long boots, to pay New Year's greetings to the Yan family. Although people laughed at him, it was not a big deal. When managing students in the school, if they did not listen to him and violated the rules, alas! Sometimes he would even use a spanking of the palm to teach them. Among the graduates now, there are not a few who have tasted his "Summer and Autumn" flavor!</p>

<h3 id="e188">Yesterday's Western League Football: First Division Championship's Last Splendid Performance, French Business School Beats Western Police 5-4 <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>In the First Half, French Business School Scored Four Consecutive Goals and Was Very Pleased</p>
<p>1-0, Donghua Was Unexpectedly Defeated by Western Business</p>
<p>2-2, Youyou and Jewish Final Draw</p>
<p>The West Union Football League, which is at the end of its life this year, had three games yesterday. The more important one was the Junior Cup final between Jewish and Youyou. Jewish, with the might of defeating China in the semi-finals of the International Football League, should have easily captured Youyou's B team and won the championship. Unexpectedly, things took an unexpected turn. In the battle at Yiyuan, Youyou took the lead and scored two consecutive goals. Unfortunately, in the second half, Jewish managed to equalize. During overtime, neither side could score. Who will win the championship is yet to be resolved. Youyou's fighting spirit is commendable and congratulatory.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting scenes was the match between the French Business School and the Western Police at Shenyuan. The French Business School had already won the First Division Championship this year. Although the outcome of yesterday's match did not affect their dominance, the Western Police had the power of winning the Scott Cup and had previously defeated the French Business School. The intensity of this battle was predictable. After the start of the match, the Western Police were very aggressive and fiercely attacked the French Business School, but they repeatedly failed to score and even lost a penalty kick opportunity. With a touch of bad luck, the French Business School scored four consecutive goals. However, in the second half, the Western Police also scored four goals against the French Business School. Unfortunately, they conceded another penalty kick. As a result, the French Business School won 5-4.</p>
<p>In the baseball field, the match between Donghua and Western Business was generally believed to be a certain victory for Donghua. Who knew that Donghua failed to field the lineup it had announced. Important players such as Dai Linjing and Wan Xianghua were all spectators. The reason, it is said, was due to some disagreements among the players, resulting in a 0-1 defeat by the mediocre Western Business. However, if Li Yichen had not missed a penalty kick, it would have been a 1-1 draw. How unfortunate for Donghua. The fans were very critical. The current standings of the First Division are recorded below:</p>

<p>It is a Pity that Youyou Declined After a Promising Start</p>
<p>Jewish's Offense and Defense Were Fierce, and Their Stamina Was Sufficient</p>
<p>Youyou's B team played against Jewish in the Junior Cup final at Yiyuan yesterday. Although there were only a few hundred spectators, the cheering was quite lively. Youyou had an absolute advantage of 2-0, but later, due to poor stamina, they conceded two consecutive goals to Jewish, resulting in a tie. During the thirty-minute overtime, both sides were exhausted, and nothing was gained. After one hundred and twenty minutes, the referee announced that the match would be rescheduled to determine the winner.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Youyou Won in the First Half <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Youyou kicked off and took the offensive first. Jewish stationed heavy troops in the second defense line. After a long time, it was difficult to open the scoring. Shen Baigui led the troops to attack and got a shot, but unfortunately it was a foot off. Jewish counterattacked several times, but Yang Mingjin's slippery hands and feet prevented them from succeeding. After a long time, Shen Baigui let his horse run in the southern suburbs and broke to the baseline. He crossed the ball with one foot. Hu Youcheng descended from the sky, close at hand. Dissley panicked and slipped, and Hu Youcheng flicked the ball into the goal. The Chinese spectators were all delighted. After the kickoff and restart, Youyou's forwards became more active. Xiao Mengchang Cheng Yize got the ball and advanced, but was blocked. He immediately passed it to Zhang Changjiang, who sent it to the goal. Xiao Shen arrived in time and kicked the ball, which went into the net again, creating an absolute advantage of 2-0.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Jewish Showed Their Ability in the Second Half <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Jewish's central defender, M. Greenberg, had a disagreement with Gottfreid and even started fighting, which was quite laughable. Fortunately, they soon reconciled. After the break, Jewish was determined to take revenge and attacked fiercely. Youyou's three central defenders defended separately, holding on for twenty minutes without opening the scoring. Jay got the ball and passed it to the center. Yang Mingjin rushed out. M. Greenberg stepped up and kicked, making the score 2-1. After that, Youyou defended even harder, with few counterattack opportunities. In the heavily defended area, Jewish troops were often active. In the last three minutes of the match, the spectators were all wishing Youyou victory and the championship. Who knew that things would be unexpected. Jewish's five forwards besieged Youyou's goal. Yang Mingjin's vision was blocked by someone, and Zhang Rong slightly missed a step, allowing M. Greenberg to seize the opportunity and send the ball into the net, making the score even, and the time was up.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Neither Side Gained Anything After Overtime <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>During the thirty-minute overtime, the two sides were exhausted and listless. Only Jewish's forwards had the spirit of fighting to the death. Occasionally, when they gained an advantage, they posed a major threat to Youyou. Fortunately, Youyou defended well, and Behring and Pike both lost their form. The thirty minutes passed uneventfully, and the overtime ended. The referee then announced that the match would be rescheduled.</p>

<p>Western Police's Counterattack Unfortunately Lost a Penalty</p>
<p>Although the field was slippery, the performance of the two teams was still very exciting. French Business School changed their goalkeeper to Raymond, who saved many dangerous shots. The central defense was solid, and the defenders were also satisfactory. The forward, Bao Shatuo, appointed Xiao Huater as the left winger, which was very effective. Unfortunately, his stamina was insufficient, and he looked tired in the afternoon, so he did not contribute much. Western Police lost a penalty kick and conceded four consecutive goals to French Business School. In the second half, Western Police attacked fiercely and adjusted Turner to be the forward, increasing the momentum. Relying on Huo Gensen's strong feet and beautiful shots, they also returned four goals. Unfortunately, they conceded another penalty kick, so they narrowly lost 4-5. The winning goals of both teams were due to the left wing. The change of the situation varied with the wind.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Western Police's Fierce Attack Repeatedly Missed Opportunities <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>After the kickoff by the Western Police, they attacked fiercely and French Business School was under attack everywhere and in danger. Jebsen stole the ball from Corlett's feet and sent it to Huo Gensen. Huo approached the goal and De Fei shot, but the ball hit the crossbar and fell under the goal. The goalkeeper was in a panic and wanted to come out to grab the ball, but De Fei had already arrived and shot again. Nie Gu Hongfu, who was filling in as the goalkeeper, managed to save it at the critical moment. De Fei's shot became a wild ball. Huo Gensen launched another attack, and the French Business School's goal was in chaos. Nie Gu Luofu's touching the ball resulted in a penalty. The inner right defender Zhai Tuo took the kick, but it was saved out of bounds by Raymond, the goalkeeper of the French Business School. Huo Gensen's corner kick was beautifully delivered, but it was not successful. Western Police were so powerful, but they failed to score, which was very unlucky. Afterwards, they lost four consecutive goals, which was very discouraging.</p>
<h3 id="e195">After a Touch of Bad Luck, Four Consecutive Goals Were Lost <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>After the Western Police touched bad luck, French Business School seemed to have a pleasant surprise from the sky, as if seeing the sun again after a storm. Their spirits were greatly boosted, and their arrogance was unmatched. The forwards were like "tigers with wings" wanting to "pounce on the ducks." The left winger Bao Shatuo passed and sent the ball, leaving no moment of peace in front of the Western Police's goal. Jay Su opened the scoring, Bao Shatuo headed the ball to make a contribution, and the goalkeeper slid in to catch it. Corlett got Fafanqie's ball and dribbled forward, approaching the goal. Xiao Tuo blocked Corlett's shot, trying to make the goalkeeper run to save the ball. Unexpectedly, Shatuo got there first and shot into the empty goal. Corlett came back and took the fort himself, Turner followed but was too late. Western Police lost four goals.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The Guest Overwhelmed the Host, and the Situation Changed <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>After the break, the Western Police took advantage of the wind and overwhelmed the host, and the situation changed. It was like the French Business School in the first half. Wei Lie first tried his feet, and the ball bounced off the crossbar and went to the left. Hurley shot again, but Masanier saved it. Jack also shot, but it was saved. De Fei attacked again, and the goalkeeper caught the ball and fell to the ground. Masanier stopped De Fei's rush, and the goalkeeper was able to get up and save it. Huo Gensen, after a long silence, launched a surprise attack and made the first contribution. Therefore, the momentum was greatly boosted, and the attack became more intense. French Business School could not cope, and Gu Shitan and Lei Midi cooperated to defend, keeping their horses running and passing the ball. The corner kick was sent out, right along the goal, and the crossbar fell. The goalkeeper jumped up and missed the ball, and the ball fell into the right corner of the goal. The Western Police were able to return two goals and made the score four to two.</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Penalty Kick Determined the Outcome <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>When the Western Police were in the midst of their rise, they unexpectedly lost a penalty kick. Because French Business School's attack occasionally went deep, Jebsen panicked and fouled. Lei Midi kicked the ball in, and French Business School took a 5-2 lead. However, Western Police scored two more goals afterwards. If they had not lost this penalty kick, it would have been a 4-4 draw. Therefore, the victory or defeat was really tied to this. At this time, Western Police adjusted Ben Toubona to be the forward, charging straight ahead, and French Business School was in great trouble. Huo Gensen shot the ball into the goal from 30 yards away, which was very beautiful. In less than two minutes, De Fei got a pass from Huo Gensen and kicked it in from three or four yards in front of the goal. With five minutes remaining, Huishi Wu took a free kick near the opponent's penalty area, but missed. As a result, French Business School won 5-4. The referee, Hale, was very weak and was ridiculed by the spectators.</p>

<p>Li Yichen Missed a Penalty Kick</p>
<p>The Situation Was Dull and the Interest Was Depressed</p>
<p>Donghua's defeat to Western Business by a score of 0-1 yesterday seems to have greatly disappointed the audience. Famous generals such as Guan Xun'an, Wan Xianghua, and Dai Linjing all stood by and watched the outcome, replacing them with newcomers. It is undoubtedly reasonable to say that victory or defeat is not worth considering. However, a team's honor should be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Donghua attacked against the wind and was blocked by the central defense line. After several minutes of back and forth, a loophole suddenly appeared in Donghua's first line of defense. Western Business took the opportunity to go straight in. Feng Nianhan kicked the ball carelessly, and it rolled in from under his legs. Lu Zhong'en was far from the goal. Mauley seized the opportunity and attacked immediately. A whistle sounded, announcing the goal. At that time, Western Business attacked the goal in a ring, and the momentum was fierce. Fortunately, they resisted unanimously and maintained the suffering situation.</p>

<p>After another twenty minutes, Donghua took the determination of "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger's cubs?". The five forwards attacked from all sides, and the battle around the enemy's goal was quite fierce. The enemy general violated the rules and committed a penalty. Li Yichen accepted the mission of the whole team and shot hard. The ball went slightly oblique, hitting the post and returning. All the hopes were dashed. In the first half, Donghua was defeated by 0-1. In the second half, Donghua made a slight improvement, and every time they were able to take advantage of the wind and attack through the gaps. However, the five forwards each acted on their own, and the golden opportunities were all missed. After ninety minutes of battle, Western Business finally won 1-0.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Ministry of Education Directive: The Earth is Divided into Seven Continents and Four Oceans <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education to the Magistrate of Chuansha County</p>
<p>丨And Instructing the Ministry of Education to Order All Publishers to Comply丨</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Order No. 518 to the Magistrate of Chuansha County states: It is hereby noted that the county previously submitted a request for interpretation of the names of oceans and continents in textbooks. As the matter concerns academic interpretation, it was forwarded to the Ministry of Education for review and instruction. The instructions received state: "Received and noted. The section requested by the Department has been instructed by the Ministry to the National Institute for Compilation and Translation for investigation, deliberation, and reporting. The Institute responded: 'Regarding the division of the Earth's continents and oceans, opinions among world scholars vary. Old geography books divide the Earth into five continents: Asia, Europe, America, Africa, and Oceania, and five oceans: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Antarctic. However, since Norwegian explorer Amundsen's Antarctic expedition in 1911 confirmed that Antarctica is a land covered by solid ice, not an ocean, it was named Antarctica. In 1909, American Peary reached the North Pole, confirming that the Arctic Ocean is merely a deep sea blocked by solid ice, not an ocean, and thus merged into the Atlantic Ocean, regarded as part of the Atlantic Ocean. German geographers largely adopted this view.' One continent was added outside the above five continents, and two oceans were removed from the five oceans, hence the classification as six continents and three oceans. From a human geography perspective, the cultures of North and South America differ, so they should be divided into North America and South America. One continent was added outside the above six continents, hence the reclassification as seven continents. In terms of topography, Europe and Asia are only separated by the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, and the Caspian Sea, with unclear natural geographic boundaries, so the two continents should be combined into Eurasia, thus changing the seven continents back to six continents. For the sake of uniformity, it seems appropriate to divide the Earth into seven continents: Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Oceania, and Antarctica, and four oceans: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic Oceans.'" The Ministry has received these details and has urgently recorded the case and issued an order for your information and to be relayed for compliance." Therefore, in addition to submitting a request to instruct all publishers to uniformly comply with the corrections, this order is issued for your information. This concludes the order.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's Submission to the Ministry of Education states: It is hereby noted that Directive No. 2629 from your Ministry was received regarding a submission from this Department requesting an interpretation of the names of oceans and continents in textbooks, briefly stating: "... Having been instructed by the Ministry to the National Institute for Compilation and Translation for investigation, deliberation, and reporting, the Institute responded, ... 'For the sake of general uniformity, it seems appropriate to divide the Earth into seven continents: Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Oceania, and Antarctica, and four oceans: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic Oceans' ... The Ministry has urgently recorded the case and issued an order for your information and to be relayed for compliance." Upon receiving this, in addition to complying with the order to relay the information, it is noted that the definitions of oceans and continents in textbooks published by various publishers are extremely divergent. Now that your Ministry has approved the classification as seven continents and four oceans, it seems appropriate to instruct uniform compliance. Previously published textbooks should also be ordered to be corrected. Furthermore, when your Ministry examines and approves textbooks in the future, this classification should be the standard to prevent discrepancies and confusion for children. For the reasons stated above, this document is submitted to request your consideration and approval to instruct all publishers to uniformly comply, as it would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to Minister of Education Wang by Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Establishment of the Chinese Cultural Construction Association <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Two Hundred Members from Shanghai and Representatives from Other Regions Arrive</p>
<p>Sixty-one Directors Including Chen Lifu Elected</p>
<p>The Chinese Cultural Construction Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday at 2:00 PM in the auditorium of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society. The association's charter was passed, and directors were elected. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Members: Yesterday's attendees from Shanghai included Wu Tiecheng, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Tong Xingbai, Shen Pengfei, Ding Mocun, Hu Puan, Zhu Yingpeng, Li Zhiyun, Zhao Nangong, Zheng Zhengqiu, Wang Boqi, Lin Zhongke, Meng Shouchun, Han Juemin, Ma Chonggan, Jiang Jianbai, Xu Xingchu, Du Gang, Xu Zexiang, Tang Zenghao, Huang Zaoxiong, Chen Jicheng, Wu Zhi, Wang Longzhang, Chen Jilie, Wang Xinming, Chen Bai, Jin Guangmei, Zhang Jiping, Ouyang Xi, and others. Representatives from Nanjing included Chen Lifu, Ye Xiufeng, Wu Dajun, and Liu Zhuang; from Hubei, Wu Xingya, Ai Yuying, and Yang Jinyu; from Jiangsu, Zhou Houjun, Zhang Gongren, Niu Changyao, Xu Luan, and Qiu Youzhen; from Sichuan, Yang Gongda; from Hankou, Yang Xingqin; from Beiping, Dong Lin; from Wuxi, Pan Xiangfeng; from Shaanxi, Liu Qingchao; from Hunan, Guo Wei; and group members from the International Society, Chinese Arts and Crafts Society, Yongjin Society, Foreign Affairs Society, Tongji Society, etc., totaling over two hundred people.</p>
<p>Establishment Details: The meeting commenced at 2:00 PM. Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng (represented by Wu Kaixian), Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Pengfei, Yang Gongda, Ai Yuying, Ye Xiufeng, and Guo Wei were elected as the presidium. Jiang Jianbai served as the emcee, and Xu Xingchu and Wang Xinming served as recorders. After the formalities, Chairman Pan Gongzhan first reported on the initiation and preparation process, followed by speeches from Tong Xingbai of the Municipal Party Department and Mayor Wu Tiecheng. The program and principles were then discussed, the draft charter was passed, and directors were elected. Around 5:00 PM, a photograph was taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Pan Gongzhan's report stated that the meaning of our association's founding is due to the current feeling that the Chinese nation has reached a critical moment of life and death. To save the country and the nation, we must make fundamental efforts, and to make fundamental efforts, we must work on culture. However, in today's fiercely competitive world, all countries are expanding their military strength and advocating force for survival. Our discussion of culture here may cause misunderstanding among some people. But we must know that to make the nation strong, we must have the conditions for national strength, and we cannot ignore culture. Culture is the way of life of the general public, all-encompassing and all-applicable. The expression of the way of life of any nation or country is culture. The evolution of society is the evolution of culture, and the expression of its evolution is the progress of the way of life. From the ancient society where people lived by fishing, hunting, animal husbandry, to agriculture, industry, and commerce, the progress of their way of life represents the progress of culture. Therefore, the scope of culture is quite broad, not only the things in books, nor is it something exclusively for bookworms. If we want to save the country and increase the nation's strength, we must work on culture. Everyone is dissatisfied with China now, but looking back at our country's thousands of years of history, it proves that our nation also has a precious spirit. The initiation of this association is to gather people across the country with the same will, on one hand to revive our country's inherent culture and promote it, and on the other hand to absorb valuable cultures from others and supplement our shortcomings, to build a culture suitable for the modern era, to seek the revival of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Party Department's Speech: Municipal Party Department representative Tong Xingbai said that since the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, many people with national consciousness have been calling and working to save the country, such as saving the country through aviation, saving the country through education, saving the country through construction, saving the country through domestic goods, etc. But these are all biased towards one aspect, and the rise and fall of a country is not caused by one aspect, but by the sum of all aspects. Therefore, the methods of saving the country should also be integrated to be effective. This method that includes all aspects is culture. China is in a dangerous situation today because of the decline of culture. Therefore, to save the country, we must work on culture. Culture includes both spiritual and material aspects. After the establishment of the Chinese Cultural Construction Association, it will be responsible for the construction of culture from both spiritual and material aspects.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: Mayor Wu said that he took an airplane from Beiping to Nanjing and from Nanjing to Hangzhou the year before last. He observed the rural areas of China on the plane and saw many old facilities, which proved that although our ancestors did not have as much knowledge as today's people, their creativity was very great. Therefore, China has thousands of years of history. Today is a critical time for survival, but there is still hope. But today, our people cannot promote the inherent, nor can they take the strengths of others to make up for their shortcomings, blindly exaggerating themselves or belittling themselves, as if going astray. Creativity is lost day by day, creating today's situation. Therefore, if Chinese culture is not revived and catches up with other countries, the lower the culture, the sooner the nation will perish. He hopes that after the establishment of the Chinese Cultural Construction Association, it will call on the country to work together to promote China's existing culture, absorb foreign cultures, and create and revive China's new culture.</p>

<p>Program Principles: The program principles of the association were then passed as follows: (A) Actively promote: (1) National spirit, (2) Scientific spirit, (3) Unified spirit, (4) Creative spirit; (B) Passively eliminate: (1) Feudal ideology, (2) Class ideology, (3) Decadent ideology, (4) Slave ideology. The draft charter was then passed, with the wording to be revised by the board of directors. The declaration of the establishment of the conference was drafted by the presidium.

<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Among the discussions in traditional Chinese medicine, none are as chaotic and confusing as those concerning typhoid fever. The name "typhoid fever" originated in the *Nei Jing* (Inner Canon). It was first established by Zhang Zhongjing, due to his writing the *Treatise on Typhoid Fever*. It then flourished through Wang Shuhe, due to his editing Zhang Zhongjing's surviving treatises. The *Nei Jing* states about typhoid fever: "All heat diseases are a kind of typhoid fever." Conversely, typhoid fever is also a kind of heat disease. The *Nan Jing* (Classic of Difficulties) states about typhoid fever: "There are five types of typhoid fever: *zhongfeng*, typhoid fever, damp-warmth, heat disease, and warm disease." Thus, typhoid fever is both a general term for all types of heat diseases, and also a specific term for one type of heat disease. And in Zhang Zhongjing's *Treatise on Typhoid Fever*, it states: "For *taiyang* disease, fever, sweating, aversion to wind, and a relaxed pulse is called *zhongfeng*." "For *taiyang* disease, whether fever is present or not, there must be aversion to cold, body aches, vomiting, and a tight pulse of both *yin* and *yang* is called typhoid fever." "For *taiyang* disease, fever and thirst without aversion to cold is called warm disease." "If there is sweating and scorching heat, it is called wind-warmth." It is therefore clear that Zhang Zhongjing's so-called *Treatise on Typhoid Fever* is actually a book that discusses heat-related diseases such as *zhongfeng*, typhoid fever, and warm disease, which is consistent with the *Nei Jing* and *Nan Jing*. It is not merely about typhoid fever with a tight pulse of both *yin* and *yang*. The *Thousand Gold Prescriptions* quotes the *Xiao Pin*, saying: "Typhoid fever is a term used by scholars, referring to epidemic warm disease. It is a term used in the countryside." The *Shi Hou Fang* (Formulas for Seasonal Diseases) states: "Scholars elegantly call it typhoid fever, while common people call it epidemic." The *Wai Tai Mi Yao* (Secret Essentials of the Outer Terrace) quotes Xu Renze discussing epidemic diseases: "Medical experts call this disease typhoid fever." Yao Gong collected evidence that typhoid fever, seasonal diseases, and warm epidemic are equally toxic. Sun Zhenren's *Thousand Gold Prescriptions* often mentions epidemic *qi*, dispelling warmth, and killing ghosts in the typhoid fever section. Zhang Wenzhong treated typhoid fever and warm disease together. *Gu Jin Lu Yan* (Ancient and Modern Recorded Experiments) considers *yin* and *yang* to be the cause of typhoid fever. From this perspective, after Zhang Zhongjing and Wang Shuhe, typhoid fever was also considered to be a seasonal heat disease with infectious properties. Before Zhang Zhongjing and Wang Shuhe, people's books often considered injury from cold to be a seasonal heat disease. After Zhang Zhongjing and Wang Shuhe, people's books also often considered typhoid fever to be a seasonal heat disease. Is Zhang Zhongjing and Wang Shuhe's view of typhoid fever like that of the ignorant and reckless people of later generations, who clamor that it is a disease of the North, a disease of winter, a disease of direct cold? Therefore, the *Treatise on Typhoid Fever* is a treatise on seasonal epidemic diseases, today's treatise on infectious diseases.</p>
<p>However, there are many arguments after the *Yin Yang Da Lun* (Great Treatise on Yin and Yang) that typhoid fever is not a seasonal epidemic *qi*. The *Yin Yang Da Lun* states: "In the severe cold of winter, all things are deeply hidden. If a gentleman is firm and secretive, he will not be harmed by the cold. Those who encounter and brave it are said to suffer from typhoid fever... those who get sick immediately are said to suffer from typhoid fever. Those who do not get sick immediately have cold toxins stored in their muscles and skin, which turn into warm disease in the spring and summer disease in the summer. Summer disease is the extreme of heat, which is more severe than warm disease. Therefore, hardworking people often suffer from warm heat diseases in spring and summer, all caused by exposure to cold in winter, not a seasonal epidemic *qi*. Seasonal epidemics occur when it should be warm in spring but is very cold again, when it should be very hot in summer but is very cool instead, when it should be cool in autumn but is very hot instead, and when it should be cold in winter but is very warm instead. This is when the *qi* is not in its season, so the diseases of the young and old are often similar within a year. This is the *qi* of seasonal epidemics."</p>
<p>Since the *Yin Yang Da Lun*, medical experts throughout the dynasties have followed its theory to differentiate the treatments of typhoid fever, warm diseases and heat diseases, which has become a trend. The *Thousand Gold Prescriptions* quotes the *Xiao Pin* as saying: "Those who discuss treatment do not distinguish typhoid fever from seasonal epidemic warm disease as different *qi*. Typhoid fever is a term used by scholars, while seasonal epidemic warm disease is a term used in the countryside. It does not discuss the differences and similarities of the diseases. Examining the various classics, they are actually quite different. The appropriate treatments are different, and the prescriptions should be distinguished." This also considers typhoid fever and warm epidemic to be different. Chao Yuanfang's *Treatise on the Causes and Symptoms of Diseases* volume 10, "Warm Disease with Eruptions," states: "If a person encounters cold toxins in the winter months, the disease will start to manifest in the spring. The disease initially appears on the exterior, and even if sweating, vomiting, or purging has been performed, the external symptoms have not subsided, and the toxic *qi* has not been dispersed, thus causing eruptions. Also, if the weather is warm in winter, people feel the *qi* of an unseasonal period and do not get sick immediately. By spring, they are folded by accumulated cold, and the toxic *qi* cannot be released. By summer, they encounter heat, the spring cold is released, and the winter warm toxins begin to erupt on the skin, causing mottled rashes like brocade patterns." The *Xiao Pin* "Ge Gen Ju Pi Tang (Kudzu and Tangerine Peel Decoction) cures winter warm disease that does not manifest immediately, but by spring, it is folded by accumulated cold and cannot erupt. By summer, it gets heat, the spring cold is released, and the winter warm toxins begin to erupt from the muscles, causing mottled rashes like brocade patterns." *Gu Jin Lu Yan's* Huang Lian Ju Pi Tang (Coptis and Tangerine Peel Decoction) and Lou Lu Ju Pi Tang (Metaplexis and Tangerine Peel Decoction) say the same as the *Xiao Pin's* Ge Gen Ju Pi Tang. This is all the theory of latent *qi* causing disease. Sun Zhenren's *Thousand Gold Prescriptions* includes seasonal epidemic warm disease in the typhoid fever section. *Wai Tai Mi Yao* analyzes it into three, reversing the claim of the *Thousand Gold Prescriptions*. It is clearly thought that typhoid fever, warm disease, and epidemic are three different things. However, it fails to draw clear boundaries. In summary, ancient people discussed cold, heat, warmth, coolness, and inflammation as diseases, which can be divided into three categories.</p>
<p>First, diseases caused by the normal *qi*. This refers to the "severe cold in winter, those who encounter and brave it are said to suffer from typhoid fever." However, upon closer examination, it seems that the normal *qi* of the four seasons can all cause disease, but not significantly. Therefore, aside from the *Yin Yang Da Lun*, it also says: "Injury from the *qi* of the four seasons can all cause disease. Typhoid fever is considered the most toxic because it is the most destructive *qi*." This means that injury from warmth in spring, heat in summer, and coolness in autumn can all cause disease, but not as severely as injury from cold in winter. Second, diseases caused by unharmonious seasonal changes, when warmth and coolness are imbalanced, and experiencing unseasonal warmth, coolness, or heat is called seasonal epidemic, also called heavenly epidemic, also called warm epidemic. Therefore, the *Typhoid Fever Example* says: "When there is unseasonal warmth in winter, it is called winter warm." It also says, "From the spring equinox to before the autumn equinox, sudden cold is considered a seasonal cold epidemic." The *Treatise on the Causes and Symptoms of Diseases* also calls seasonal cold epidemics seasonal typhoid fever. This all refers to diseases caused by injury from unseasonal and discordant cold, heat, warmth, and coolness. This is the so-called *qi* of seasonal epidemics.</p>
<p>Third, diseases that do not manifest immediately after infection, but remain latent in the body and arise when there is an opportunity, which is what later generations call "latent *qi*" causing disease. As the *Su Wen Sheng Qi Tong Tian Lun* (Plain Questions: Treatise on Promoting the Natural Qi of the Body) says: "Injury from wind in spring, the pathogenic *qi* lingers, resulting in diarrhea. Injury from heat in summer, it becomes malaria in autumn. Injury from dampness in autumn, it rises and causes coughing, developing into paralysis. Injury from cold in winter, warm disease must occur in spring." This speaks of the beginning of latent *qi* causing disease. The aforementioned "Warm Disease with Eruptions" in the *Treatise on the Causes and Symptoms of Diseases*, which speaks of encountering cold toxins in winter, and also speaks of warm weather in winter, when people feel the *qi* of an unseasonal period, also speaks of latent *qi* causing disease. However, the *Su Wen* saying of injury from wind in spring, and the *Treatise on the Causes and Symptoms of Diseases* saying of encountering cold toxins in winter, refer to diseases caused by injury from the normal *qi* of the four seasons that do not manifest immediately. If the *Treatise on the Causes and Symptoms of Diseases* speaks of warm weather in winter, when people feel the *qi* of an unseasonal period, it refers to diseases caused by injury from the epidemic *qi* of the four seasons that do not manifest immediately. Therefore, ancient people also had the theory that seasonal epidemic warm diseases can be contracted without immediate manifestation, with latent *qi* causing disease.</p>
<p>From this perspective, typhoid fever can either manifest immediately or not manifest immediately after infection, and warm diseases can also either manifest immediately or not manifest immediately after infection. Seasonal epidemics can also either manifest immediately or not manifest immediately after infection. The distinction between the three is poorly defined by the ancients. Only for the *qi* of seasonal epidemics, there is a clear indication, saying, "The *qi* is not in its season." Saying, "Within a year, the diseases of the young and old are often similar." This is all there is.</p>
<h3 id="e211">On Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhiguo</p>
<p>(I) The Formation of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>In modern medicine, the cause of pulmonary tuberculosis is known to be the mischief of a type of bacteria, tubercle bacilli. In our country's old medicine, it is said to be caused by overwork and accumulated weakness. Therefore, there are names such as postpartum tuberculosis and marital tuberculosis. In fact, the mere invasion of tubercle bacilli into the human body does not necessarily lead to pulmonary tuberculosis. And simply due to overwork and accumulated weakness, one does not necessarily suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis. It is necessary for both to combine to produce pulmonary tuberculosis. Therefore, the formation of pulmonary tuberculosis has two conditions: one is external cause, and the other is the body's adaptive state (Disposition). The external cause is the invasion of tubercle bacilli into the body. The so-called body's adaptive state is the degree of resistance. Tubercle bacilli are ubiquitous in the bustling city and warm around us. They have quite strong resistance. Tubercle bacilli coming from the sputum of patients can remain alive for a long time, flying in the dust, and can invade the human body anytime and anywhere. It is not necessary to be infected only when close to a pulmonary tuberculosis patient. We may have one or two tubercle bacilli invading the respiratory system every day, but it does not necessarily cause disease. This is because a healthy body has resistance and can eliminate the invading bacteria. Even if the invading bacteria wreak havoc in the lungs, it only causes minor local lesions, which heal quickly without causing any symptoms or spreading into a disease. And we are completely unaware of this temporary lesion. Even doctors cannot prove it with the most precise diagnostic methods. Readers may not believe what has been said above, but there is solid evidence: according to autopsy statistics, up to 96 or 97 out of every 100 people have had traces of localized pulmonary tuberculosis in their lungs. It can be seen that in the course of our lives, we must have been attacked by pulmonary tubercle bacilli once or twice, or many times, and localized lesions occur in the lungs, but they heal spontaneously without leading to pulmonary tuberculosis. If the body's resistance is weakened due to various adverse effects in life, such as overwork, improper living, or suffering from other diseases, then the invading tubercle bacilli can take the opportunity to become rampant and cause pulmonary tuberculosis. The old medicine's so-called excessive production and marital activities are also causes of weakening the body's resistance, and are only inducements to pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The body's adaptive state is also formed by two conditions. The first is congenital (Constitution), which is commonly referred to as constitution. In modern medicine, there is a term for pulmonary tuberculosis constitution, which means that the body's structure is prone to pulmonary tuberculosis. The second is acquired (Condition), which is formed by living conditions. Constitution varies from person to person, and living conditions also differ from person to person. Therefore, the body's adaptive state varies from person to person, not only distinguishing between pulmonary tuberculosis constitution and non-pulmonary tuberculosis constitution. Even among those who suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis, the symptoms and course also vary due to their different adaptive states. Some die after suffering for a few months, while others survive for more than ten years after contracting the disease. Clinically, there are acute, chronic, proliferative, exudative, open, and closed types, in various forms and with many names. The reason for this is not that the invading tubercle bacilli are different, but that the patients' levels of resistance are different. Some cannot withstand the destruction of the bacteria and allow them to run rampant, causing the lesions to progress rapidly and leading to death in a few months. Others can continue to struggle with the bacteria and survive for more than ten years. Readers who understand the above will know that paying attention to daily hygiene and strengthening the body for those with a weak constitution to make it stronger day by day is the way to prevent pulmonary tuberculosis. For those who already have pulmonary tuberculosis, when there is no specific treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, strengthening the body and increasing resistance is the only way to prevent the progression of the disease.</p>
<p>(II) The Course of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>The course and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis are the most uncertain. Originally, the course and symptoms of any disease vary from person to person and have no fixed pattern. What is described in books is only a general overview. Therefore, the great master of internal medicine, Krehl, said in the preface to his pathology book: "There are only sick people, not so-called diseases," which is a definite statement.</p>
<p>Although most other acute infectious diseases have predictable courses and symptoms, pulmonary tuberculosis alone progresses from mild to severe to near death with no fixed steps. Comparing several pulmonary tuberculosis patients, their courses and symptoms, as well as the lesions in their lungs, are different from each other. The reason for this is twofold. First, the body's adaptive state not only varies from person to person, but also varies from time to time in the same patient, either due to changes in living conditions, or due to infection with other diseases, or due to physiological changes (such as pulmonary tuberculosis patients worsening due to pregnancy), causing the body's resistance to sometimes increase and sometimes decrease, causing the tubercle bacilli in the body to sometimes run rampant and sometimes remain dormant. Second, the invasion of tubercle bacilli can occur anytime and anywhere. For example, a person who has pulmonary tuberculosis is gradually getting better, and suddenly a large number of tubercle bacilli invade the lungs, causing the disease to worsen again. Therefore, the pattern of lesions in the lungs of pulmonary tuberculosis patients is unusually complex, with some being necrotic, some having healed scars, and some just starting to become inflamed, each progressing and coexisting with each other. Clinically, although they are divided into various types such as proliferative, exudative, or caseous cavity, in fact, the lungs of most pulmonary tuberculosis patients have all types. Except for those in the early stages, there will be no pure type.</p>
<p>Readers who understand the above will talk about the three stages of pulmonary tuberculosis. All diseases progress gradually from mild to severe to near death, with no clear boundaries. In several relatively regular acute infectious diseases, such as measles, true pneumonia, etc., it is still possible to divide them into several stages based on the course of rash and fever subsidence, or based on anatomical changes (such as true pneumonia). As for the course and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, which are not fixed at all, and the lesions in the lungs are of all types, how can they be staged? If you talk about the severity of the disease, for example, those who are near death are in the third stage, and those in the early stage are in the first stage, then there is even more no boundary standard. However, people today talk about pulmonary tuberculosis, and they must say which stage it is. Patients fear the arrival of the third stage, as if they have been sentenced to death. And doctors also exaggerate the third stage to boast about the magic of their diagnosis and treatment. If you ask them in detail: What is the third stage? I am afraid that many people will be speechless. I do not want to denigrate others, but medical ethics are declining day by day. Now there are even those who call themselves specialists in the treatment of third-stage pulmonary tuberculosis. Just from the phrase "specializing in the treatment of third-stage" alone, it can be seen that they have no knowledge of pathology and boast themselves as experts. What they call the third stage must be based on the severity of the disease. They can point to those who come to them for treatment as being in the first or second stage, and point to those who are near death as being in the third stage. There are also those who are ambiguous and say to the patient: Your disease is between the first and second stage or the second and third stage, as if they know the disease like the back of their hand. This is really not worth the laughter of knowledgeable people.</p>
<p>Then, are there three stages of pulmonary tuberculosis? Yes, there are. It started with Banke, who specializes in the study of pulmonary tuberculosis. Here, I have to clarify that in the past, the medical community also divided it into three stages based on the degree and scope of lesions. However, the types of lesions, as I have described, are always of all types. As for the scope of lesions, it cannot indicate the degree of progression of pulmonary tuberculosis, so there is no standard and it is denied by the public. According to Banke's research, pulmonary tuberculosis patients have a special situation, that is, they do not have any reaction when they first contract the disease. Therefore, those in the early stage are not known to themselves and cannot be observed by doctors. After the lesions spread and progress, the body produces a particularly strong reaction.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>That is, a violent reaction to a toxin of tubercle bacilli. This reaction is actually a manifestation of resistance. Banke called this time the allergic stage, or the second stage. Therefore, the initial stage without reaction is called the first stage. If the lesions spread even further and the tubercle bacilli in the body are unusually rampant, then the body's resistance will gradually decline until it cannot resist, so the reaction disappears again. This time is called the third stage. As for the strength or absence of the reaction, fever is used as the standard for symptoms, and cell proliferation is used as the standard for lesions. The most identifiable method is the injection of tubercle bacilli toxin. In the second stage, if tubercle bacilli toxin is injected into the skin, a violent inflammation will occur at the injection site, and subcutaneous injection will always cause fever and other phenomena. If it is done in the first stage, this reaction is weaker or absent. If it is done in the third stage, there is no reaction. Clinically speaking, patients in the first stage have no symptoms at all, at most they are just weak. At this time, not only the patient does not know, but the doctor cannot diagnose it. The lesions in the lungs are also very slight, and even X-rays may not be able to show them. In the second stage, there are symptoms such as tidal fever. If the lesions spread very quickly, the fever will be very high. Patients can die in the second stage due to excessive reaction. In the third stage, there is no fever, but the body is always abnormally weak and emaciated, leading to death. As for the course of each stage, it is not fixed. Many people in the first stage get better. That is, those who do not have pulmonary tuberculosis in appearance in autopsy statistics. Unfortunately, after entering the second stage, they either gradually get better, or unfortunately die immediately, or remain in the second stage for more than ten or twenty years. Only once the body's resistance suddenly weakens due to other reasons, it will turn into the third stage. If you turn into the third stage, then the time of death must be near. However, there are also those who can maintain it for a long time due to proper care and increased resistance. (The disappearance of the reaction in the third stage is also due to increased immunity. It is not included because it is costly and difficult for general readers to understand.) In short, the division of pulmonary tuberculosis into three stages is based on reaction, and those who are near death are not necessarily patients in the third stage. Many people die in the second stage, and there are also those who live in the third stage for a long time. As for the duration of the second stage and the speed of death, it all depends on the patient's adaptive state.</p>
<h3 id="e212">After the Draft of the Shanghai Municipal Medical Association's Consultation Fee Regulations (Continued) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>A patient I recently diagnosed is a good example. The patient was suffering from epididymitis (gonorrheal), and had been bedridden for two and a half months when I went to see him! We know that for epididymitis, in addition to treating the root cause, the relief of subjective symptoms does not take long. Even if something goes wrong and leads to local suppuration, even if a surgical incision is used, it does not take very long. It should not take two or three months of being bedridden. If this patient slowly recovers in the future, wouldn't the past two months of time and money be completely wasted! Third, regardless of the severity of the illness, the only best policy is to prolong medical treatment as much as possible. This is the pattern of extravagance among our rich families, but unfortunately, there are also many middle-class people with this bad habit. I remember that earlier, a patient's child had a cold; in the morning, a doctor was called to inject owandin once. After three or four o'clock, the patient saw that the temperature had risen, and immediately called another doctor. This colleague also told the patient that it was okay. In the afternoon, they came to me again. I diagnosed him with bronchitis and was afraid that he would suffer from bronchial pneumonia as a result. At the same time, due to the patient's request, I gave him an injection of Transpumino. At night, they called another doctor. As a result, the temperature completely dropped the next day. Just imagine that a minor illness that is irrelevant to gains and losses results in more than four times the consultation fee. How can we not cry out that medical expenses are difficult to bear! Fortunately, these were all formal doctors, and their wording was very proper. I think if an ordinary so-called medical skill had been used, the child's recovery would naturally be entirely due to his efforts. The patient would have to scold us front people for being useless. I think the patient's bad habits are actually more than these, but if we can clearly recognize these three types and correct them, I think the medical burden saved will definitely be not small.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to add one point to this draft. First, the colleagues I know and my personal consultation examples all have a clause for annual health consultation. Generally, it is 100 yuan per person per year, 200-300 yuan for a small family, and 400-500 yuan for a large family. This includes all regular consultation fees except for surgery fees and medicine fees. I think this matter is very beneficial to the middle class. Generally, patients who live within their means and have a complete plan can at least budget for the correct amount of medical expenses that they must bear each year. Even if a major illness occurs, it will not cost a huge amount of money at once, which goes against the original budget. As for people with a monthly income of only 50 to 100 yuan, it is possible to slightly reduce the price depending on their living conditions (50 yuan for individuals, 100 yuan for small families). I think the burden on patients will also be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Second, most ordinary patients are unwilling to stay in the hospital when they are sick. This is my personal special character, which can be avoided. But this makes the doctor even more painful! Except for major surgery where there is no way, patients would prefer ordinary minor surgery or medium surgery at home. Therefore, sometimes the doctor's instruments and various tools for performing surgery are often taken to the patient's home. In this situation, the attending physician must of course work harder, and the result may not be good. To give a common example, intravenous injection is possible for everyone, but at the patient's home, it is sometimes difficult due to unsuitable lighting and bed. Other surgeries can be imagined! Furthermore, the doctor cannot fully exercise his duties when the patient is at home. For example, after you perform an incision surgery for the patient, the patient takes another prescription that you do not allow at the same time, and you certainly cannot stop it. As a result, if the patient gets worse, the responsibility must be borne by the person performing the surgery. Therefore, I advocate that all kinds of small and medium surgeries should be performed in the hospital, and patients who insist on performing them at home should be charged double or triple the original price. I personally feel that these two points can be added to the draft. I don't know what my new medical colleagues think after reading it. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e213">Treatment for Noma <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Shaohang</p>
<p>Noma is the name in old medicine. The new medicine calls it necrotizing stomatitis. Stomatitis Gangraenosa, also known as water cancer, Wasserkrebs, Noma. Regardless of new or old medicine, this disease is considered a dangerous one. Hearing about it makes people frown and shake their heads. My seventh son was attacked by this disease when he had just escaped from the lung disaster. How could a weak child like a candle in the wind withstand the destruction of this evil disease? In just two days, he ended his young life. I don't know why God created such a cruel disease. At the same time, I also regret the lack of a solution in our medical community. Therefore, I feel the importance of treatment, so I will first disclose the methods I know, hoping that my comrades will teach me. The cause of this disease has not yet been clarified. Some say it is a spirochete, Spiroheta, and others say it is an amoeba, Amoeba. In short, children who are physically weak and malnourished are most likely to get this disease, which is a fact recognized by everyone. According to Gierke, there are two kinds of inducements: poverty, malnutrition, and uncleanliness are external causes. Infectious diseases such as measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough, smallpox, intermittent fever, pneumonia, dysentery, and tuberculous toxins, and systemic diseases such as English disease (Rachits) and hemorrhagic diathesis are internal causes. Among them, it occurs most often after measles.</p>
<p>The symptoms of this disease, outwardly, are cheek gangrene. It first occurs on the inside of the cheek, near the corner of the mouth, with blisters turning into ulcers. It smells rotten. Then it quickly spreads to the entire oral cavity and the affected area. In just a few days, the ulcers will penetrate the skin and flesh of the cheeks, and the exposed bone will also die in the same way. The affected side of the face is swollen, the nearby lymph nodes are swollen, and there is slight pain in the local area. The amount of secretions in the mouth increases, mixed with pus and blood. The temperature fluctuates, and severely it can reach above forty degrees. The consumption of physical strength is as rapid as a hurricane. Therefore, it often suddenly collapses. Speaking of the statistics of the number of deaths, even in foreign countries with medical expertise, three-quarters of them die.</p>
<p>The most important thing in the treatment of this disease is to maintain physical strength, increase nutrition, and prevent the spread. However, because it comes too quickly, it is often caught off guard. I will disclose the general treatment methods below, which may be used as a reference for medical practitioners and patients, and to commemorate my sorrow.</p>
<p>(1) Systemic nutrition. This can be used as a preventive method. It is too late to embrace Buddha's feet when you are already sick. Regarding medicines that increase nutrition, I like to use "Old Tonic Medicine" (R)obural, "Vigantol" Vigantol, "Haliverol", "Rayolex", "Lextron", etc. It is best to use more milk regularly. The goat milk of Shanghai Goat Milk Company is actually more reasonable than milk.</p>
<p>For patients who are already sick, use vitamin B intravenous or subcutaneous injection. For blood transfusion, if it is a child, you can use the blood of his parents for intramuscular injection. The method is to first inject 5 C.C. of 5% sterile sodium citrate solution into the syringe, and then take 50 cc of blood and inject it into the gluteal muscle. As for the amount of blood and the interval of injection, it should of course be determined by the doctor at any time according to the age of the child and the severity of the disease.</p>
<p>For disinfection in the oral cavity, you can use 5% hydrogen peroxide, 200-300 times mercuric chloride solution, 300-500 times Rivanol solution, or 1000 times potassium permanganate solution to gargle or wipe.</p>
<p>For the rotten part, use silver 606 powder or 5%-10% glycerin application. Silver nitrate corrosion or cauterization with a cauterizing device, or use a sharp spoon to scrape. According to elderly people, the application and gargling of tung oil is almost 100% effective. Now the treatment of lung disease with kerosene has attracted the attention of the medical community. Tung oil is originally an antiseptic, and it may have the possibility of killing bacteria. I hope comrades will pay more attention.</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Actual Experiment of Curing Lung Disease with Kerosene (Third Sequel) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Please note that this article is a report on the actual experiments of various Japanese families using kerosene. It is recorded for the reference of those in our country who care. As for the actual results, it is still in the process of researching and collecting materials, and it cannot be reported hastily.</p>
<p>(III) Kerosene Used as a Medicine for the Treatment of Lung Diseases is More Effective Than Any Other Medicine</p>
<p>Kimura Satayuu, Doctor of Medicine, Medical Office of Kawasaki Shipyard in Kobe (Talk)</p>
<p>Page 5 of the lower volume of Pharmaceutical Chemistry written by Dr. Shunichiro Shimoyama of Pharmaceutical Science states: "European folks use kerosene as a medicine for chronic intestinal catarrh." Also, the Stone section of the Compendium of Materia Medica states that Shizhen said, the smell of kerosene is the same as realgar and sulfur, so it kills insects and treats sores. It has a common nature of running around, so it can penetrate all kinds of utensils. It is only stored in porcelain and glass without leaking. Qian Yi used it in the Silver Liquid Pill for treating children's fright and fever, diaphragmatic fullness, vomiting, and phlegm. He also used it to make pills with mercury, calomel, borneol, scorpion tail, and Typhonium flagelliforme. It is said that it not only uses the power of this substance to resolve phlegm, but also uses its ability to clear the meridians and penetrate the orifices. It can be said that he has extremely brilliant insights.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the use of kerosene for medicinal purposes has existed since ancient times, and it is not a rare thing. However, it cannot be said that it is a new discovery to think that it has special effects on pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>I and Mr. Matsuo of the Kawasaki Shipyard Medical Bureau advised many lung disease patients among the workers to try taking kerosene. More than half of the 50 or 60 people were completely cured in a short period of time by taking kerosene. The other half did not have significant results because they were quite seriously ill. This was not given as medicine. It was only given to those who were willing to take it, without charging for the oil, and letting them try it voluntarily. Therefore, some people even drank a whole cup of kerosene twice, causing severe coughing. Those who were able to pay attention to the amount and drink it mostly felt refreshed at first, and then did not see night sweats from the next night. After two or three days, they definitely felt an increase in appetite. These three were all experiences gained from drinking kerosene. Previous medicines had never seen such a significant effect.</p>
<p>Although I cannot say that kerosene can cure any lung disease, I am deeply convinced that it is more effective than any medicine before.</p>
<p>(IV) Effective for All But One Out of Fifty People</p>
<p>Kimoshita Seiji, Medical Doctor, 8 Futaba Town, Hayashida District, Kobe City</p>
<p>I am currently conducting various animal experiments, and the results will be announced at the Medical Association. Injecting kerosene into the abdominal cavity of animals (mice), the hair of the animal's whole body has oil and smells of kerosene in less than 30 minutes. The same situation also applies to humans. As for its lethal dose, people can drink up to 300 watts and still not die.</p>
<p>Regarding the types of kerosene, I have checked eight types, and it is known that it is safer to use "Uematsu" brand kerosene, I don't know if it is safe to use lower-quality kerosene.</p>
<p>Regarding clinical examples, although there are only more than 50 cases, except for one case of severe patients with pleurisy and third-stage pulmonary tuberculosis, the results were not good, and the other results were very good. The faster ones only drank twice, and the slower ones only drank 15 times before the disease was completely cured.</p>
<p>The amount drunk is adjusted from 7-8 watts to 20 watts depending on the age and symptoms. Drink it once every five days or a week. The time to drink it should be three or four hours after dinner. It is not necessary to skip dinner. If you find it difficult to drink, you can add one or two drops of peppermint oil to drink.</p>
<p>The example that amazed me was a 30-year-old woman who had been ill for exactly one year. She was a severe patient with tuberculosis in both lungs and progressing to the larynx. This person drank kerosene 15 times in two months, and did not need to lie in bed absolutely still. After that, she engaged in healthy living for half a year and was completely cured. Because there are such examples, there is no doubt about the effect of kerosene.</p>

<p>— Peng Xin</p>
<p>To survive in society is no different than trying to save oneself in the sea. Winds and waves rage, fish and dragons become enraged. Those who can swim float, those who cannot sink; those who have something to rely on float and live; those who have nothing to rely on and cannot swim sink and die.</p>
<p>There are many novelists in society who often depict extremely dark situations, how ferocious and terrifying villains are, and how weak and pitiful good people are. Moreover, those who are oppressed are always women, who are invariably innocent and blameless. Or, loyal ministers are framed by treacherous officials, and the ending is invariably tragic. Such things, when old people see them, inevitably shed tears and sigh. Young people, when they see them, may be frightened or righteously indignant, establishing many strange ambitions and producing many romantic actions...</p>
<p>Are these kinds of things really concocted by a few busybodies over tea and wine? Or is there really something to them? The truth is that there is probably something to them; what is recorded is only a tiny "scale of the dragon," but regrettably, the author's technique is not very skillful, only leaving a shallow mark.</p>
<p>The so-called darkness is truly dark to the extreme. No wonder children in the interior sometimes go missing, going out to learn "the Way" and wanting to become "knights-errant." But the "knights-errant" seem to have a lot of their own affairs to attend to, sometimes having to "fight magic" with someone, and mostly having to be bodyguards for the rich and powerful, which does not help society or benefit the people. Society remains dark. So what is to be done?</p>
<p>In a word, self-rescue is all that is needed.</p>
<p>I imagine Bismarck calmly drawing his pistol when facing a prince trapped in the mud on the opposite side, and the prince leaping out in response. What wise action is this! We often suffer many malicious blows in daily life, but they often produce good results, making us stronger. This is not rare. There has never been anything without weaknesses, but there has never been any creature without the means of survival. Even in the sea of suffering, humans are not aquatic, but they have hands and feet and can swim. There should always be a way to manage oneself?</p>
<p>What is lamentable is not the failure to fight against the darkness, but that one is not bright oneself, able to save oneself but not doing so, and causing others who are able to save themselves to be unable to do so, insisting that everyone sink to the bottom, and still shouting "Save people!" But such typical figures seem to be rare at present.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Feelings on Moving <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>It has been half a year since I moved my family to Shanghai. At first, I was quite wary. Urban civilization has swallowed up so many people; even those with property complain about not being able to survive, let alone those of us who rely solely on our brains and labor to make a living. Therefore, I agreed with my wife that coming here means "only being allowed to endure hardship, not being allowed to enjoy blessings."</p>
<p>Half a year has passed under these eight characters.</p>
<p>I understand that I will never enjoy blessings in my life. Even if my wife sometimes has some dreams, they are not very big. We only want to live a stable life, no longer worry, and let us mingle in the ranks of the masses to do some things that should be done.</p>
<p>But these days have been anything but stable. Needless to say, very little work has been done. I myself am often sick, though not to the point of lying in bed all day, but I always feel listless and without any energy. Every day, noisy sounds come from outside the door: hawkers' cries, women's arguments, children's wails, fortune-tellers, junk collectors, street performers, all shouting at the top of their voices, assaulting my ears. I seem to see the veins on everyone's faces. I am disgusted. Perhaps there is some premonition; for all acts of seeking a living, I always feel particularly pricked in my heart.</p>
<p>Gradually, my unpleasant emotions deepened, and I vented my anger on my dwelling. I felt that the location here was bad, and the room was too messy. Newspapers were on top of books, and books were on top of newspapers; one corner of the table was covered with pens, ink, and water, and the other corner was covered with rice bowls and dishes. The air inside never circulated, and there was no sunlight in the morning or evening. I hid inside all day, like dozing off, but not really falling asleep.</p>
<p>I could not tolerate all this mess, nor could I make a living by chewing on bitter juice; I had to spit out all bitter juice. I could not even catch my breath here. So I decided to move, move away, and move my heart as well.</p>
<p>On a drizzly morning, I wandered on the streets. From the main streets to the small alleys, from the deep lanes to the bustling markets, I inquired at the door of every house. Rain beat on my head, and mud splashed all over my body.</p>
<p>I had no regrets.</p>
<p>Wealthy merchants seek comfort in their lives, poets and artists seek to beautify their lives, but I, I only seek tranquility. I cannot lie on a "sofa" chair, let the back of the chair support my head, and leisurely plan commercial victories while holding a "cigar." Nor can I let my leather shoes click on the vermilion floor while whistling and searching for poetic verses. I do not want comfort, do not want beautification, only seek tranquility. Thus, on a secluded road not far from the hustle and bustle, I found a place to live.</p>
<p>We quickly moved in.</p>
<p>One day, two days, passed quietly. There was not a single noisy sound here; everything around was quiet. I was very happy and decided to read more books here.</p>
<p>A few days later, because I sighed accidentally, immediately, a long, sharp sigh also came from the dark corner of the wall, quietly, stirring up my desolate emotions again.</p>
<p>I moved my house, but I could not move my heart.</p>

<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>The comings and goings of people are often completely devoid of freedom. I was troubled by this kind of thought for a very long time. Although life is active, it is like a beetle with no resistance at all, being moved, teased, and sometimes burned to death, disappearing silently from the world... When I thought like this, I could not help but think of flying birds, and of Ah Li, the Hakka shepherd boy in Lion Rock Hill.</p>
<p>That day was particularly hot; the sun was like a burning brazier. Lion Rock Hill, covered with bushes and shrubs, trembled wearily with its long hair, sweat flowed incessantly from the spring, and it let out a low panting sound.</p>
<p>The farmers who were cutting rice near the foot of the mountain, with only a pair of short trousers covering their waists, had their entire bodies, with their purple-red muscles, exposed. They wiped their backs and chests incessantly with wet Korean towels draped over their shoulders, straightened their backs, and lowered their heads again. The village women, whose flesh was the same color as the men, also rolled up their trouser legs and sleeves, bending and straightening their bodies as they gathered the scattered rice stalks. Sometimes, they ran to the foot of the mountain to scoop up a mouthful of spring water to drink, and then rubbed the dirt on their faces with their wet fingers like cats.</p>
<p>While I was doing housework, the woman next door came in to borrow a liter of rice from my sister. Without even hearing clearly, my sister grabbed the woman's arm, and like the fox in the fairy tale who entices crows, she exaggeratedly spoke at length about how her husband in the army was about to be promoted, and then made a generous gesture, measuring out a liter of rice and adding a pinch, before letting the impatient woman return.</p>
<p>"We'll see how it is in Guangzhou in a few days. If it's around two dollars, then we'll hire a maid. You can go to a factory or somewhere to learn a craft," she said, still carrying the remaining joy.</p>
<p>Before the sun hid behind Lion Rock Hill, I jumped onto the back of the cow. I hit the docile animal with a bamboo pole and headed towards the lawn. The ground was covered with a shallow layer of gold, and the grass slowly stretched its lazy body, as if to recover from the day's fatigue. Looking into the distance, the farmers in the rice fields, because the time for rest was approaching, also sang songs with a somewhat pleasant tone. I lowered my head to look at the cow chewing grass, trying to calm my tense heart, paying attention to my eager voice.</p>
<p>"The road is wide for running horses,</p>
<p>Half a well of water is good for making tea;</p>
<p>My girl will not marry,</p>
<p>But abandons her brother to marry a rich family!"</p>
<p>Ah Li, the familiar estate guard from Lai Family Village – a strong boy of seventeen or eighteen – rode his cow up to me. His face was as melancholy as usual, as if he had never encountered a pleasant thing in his life. "Will you marry me?" He raised his head and asked stubbornly, as he had done before. But I remembered the song from just now, and my skin felt like it was being gnawed by mountain ants, a bit itchy and uncomfortable; the words I had prepared to tell him that I would soon be leaving here to go to Guangzhou City were swept away by a sudden surge of anger. I deliberately changed to a mocking tone and said to him, "Can you dig a good well for me in the village? They are all astringent, all turned into the saliva of the rich, with no original taste of the water at all!"</p>

<p>— Yao Ke</p>
<p>(1) Ballad House</p>
<p>After eight o'clock in the evening, in a corner of the Dong'an Market, the hurried sound of strings vibrated in the air. Following this sound, running up a creaking staircase, a row of gray-yellow glass windows faced us, which was the so-called "Ballad House."</p>
<p>"Please come inside," a person opened a long window, saying with a smile.</p>
<p>Inside were rows of half-tables, covered with not very white cloth; on the rattan chairs by the tables, a dozen or twenty people sat scattered, mouths agape, staring intently at a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl on the stage. She was tapping clappers with her left hand, and her right-hand mallet pecked, pecked, pecked at the leather drum like an old hen. Sharp sounds, like a string of pearls, burst from her blood-red mouth into the air filled with smoke and tea vapor. Beside her sat two clay-like musicians, mechanically playing the sanxian and sihu.</p>
<p>"...Po Xi said...San Lang...Dong Ta Dong Dong..." The waiter brought up a pot of scented tea, a plate of melon seeds, and a twisted black hot towel in this singing sound. A thin old man sitting in front suddenly shook his head and emitted an owl-like strange sound - "Good!" Startled, I looked at the stage, and the girl had already placed her clappers on the drum surface and turned to go backstage.</p>
<p>The music on stage also stopped. A person with a rat-like face, shaking a folding fan, ran to my seat, opened the fan with a swoosh, bent over, and said with a giggle: "Liu Yufeng...Xiao Pingguo...good voice...and beautiful..."</p>
<p>Written on the fan were the names of the songs, such as "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats," "Capturing Zhang Sanlang Alive," and the like; I shook my head to indicate that I didn't want any, and this fan-shaker – vulgarly called "eater of air" – had no choice but to go to another seat, bend over and smile, and whisper to a fat man, repeatedly raising his thumb and gesturing towards the backstage. After a long time, he suddenly triumphantly closed the fan with a swoosh, and shouted with a drawn-out voice: "Xiao Pingguo, sing a section at random!"</p>
<p>Xiao Pingguo came out from backstage - a fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl who looked anemic - picked up the clappers and mallet, and mechanically sang. Her voice was hoarse and low, and she coughed repeatedly while singing, clearly showing symptoms of a severe cold, but where does that count as an illness here!</p>
<p>I couldn't listen anymore; when I got up to leave, I saw a yellow paper pasted on the wall behind the curtain, on which was written: "Position of Wing Constellation Star Lord," and on both sides was written: "Clear Sound Boy, Dong Board Lord."</p>
<p>This is Xiao Pingguo's only savior.</p>

<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>She quickly got up. After a brief wash, she went out to the nearest newsstand, pulled out a copy of a bi-weekly literary journal, and saw that there was indeed no "Taste of Life" in it. She paid for it, clutched it tightly, and walked straight to Xi Zhuoyun's office.</p>
<p>"What, 'Taste of Life' wasn't published?" Yina took out the literary bi-weekly she had brought with her and pointed to another article in the place where "Taste of Life" should have been published.</p>
<p>"Because the color of 'Taste of Life' is too strong, we wanted to ask you to change some of it, so..." Zhuoyun explained.</p>
<p>"The color is too strong? What color is too strong? And, you wanted to ask me to change some of it, why didn't you notify me earlier? If you had notified me earlier, and I had changed it – though I really don't know where to start changing – wouldn't it still be possible to publish it today?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't really matter if it's published a few issues later," she said lightly.</p>
<p>Yina almost slapped him, but she finally managed to restrain herself.</p>
<p>"But, sir," she lowered her voice and said, "I already told you that I needed money, and you said that I would only get the publication fee after two or three issues had been published; now..."</p>
<p>"That's not a problem," Zhuoyun interrupted, "because the author of the article being published now is a friend of the boss, and he borrowed money from him privately, and he transferred it to the editorial department to pay off the debt with his manuscript. This manuscript was submitted in September, and I haven't had a chance to use it; now the boss is urging me, saying that it must be printed before the end of the year, so I published it like this. As for your publication fee, we'll say that your manuscript was submitted a long time ago, and it was delayed because we wanted to publish that article, and we'll ask them to pay your publication fee first."</p>
<p>Hearing that, she calmed down. She thought he had his difficulties too. For her, as long as she could get the money, she wouldn't ask anything else: what did it matter if it was published sooner or later? What did it matter even if it wasn't published? But he said that the color of "Taste of Life" was too strong, and she didn't know how it was too strong.</p>
<p>"You said that 'Taste of Life' needed to be changed a bit, but I don't know how to change it?" she asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Just change a few sentences where the color is too strong; if you allow it, let us deliberate on it for you."</p>
<p>Deliberate for her? Good, let it go?</p>
<p>"Okay, that's fine. Also, did the publishing department say anything about selling the manuscript?"</p>

<h3 id="e223">Theories and Facts Regarding Rent Reduction <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Duan Sheng</p>
<p>I. The Origins of the Prosperity of the Real Estate Industry</p>
<p>The prosperity of the Shanghai real estate industry, although a natural result of the development of commerce and industry, is mostly an irregular and particularly abnormal development. Shanghai's prosperity has historically been inversely proportional to the turmoil in the interior. Every time the interior experienced a disturbance, Shanghai would inevitably gain a certain amount of population, build a few more buildings, and accumulate more wealth. After the Restoration, Shanghai's face changed dramatically. After several civil wars, Shanghai's face changed again. After the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai and established its capital in Nanjing, Shanghai's face underwent a major and special transformation. Superficially, it was rich and pleasing, but the actual situation was still difficult to say. Shanghai was more like a mouth for intake and output than a stomach for digestion. Imported goods had to be absorbed by the interior, and exported goods had to come from the interior. Therefore, the interior was the root, and Shanghai was the branch. If the root is strong, the branches will flourish. There has never been a case where the root and branches are withered, but the trunk alone can thrive. Since Shanghai's prosperity and decline are tied to the prosperity and decline of the interior, why does the real estate industry alone flourish when the interior is troubled? This is precisely due to political factors. Let me briefly explain the reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai has concessions, and although it has been affected by internal turmoil, it has remained safe. Thus, after each internal disturbance, people from the interior always regard Shanghai as a refuge. Those with assets regard it as a place to store their goods. Over time, they also stayed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) When the National Revolutionary Army marched north, they supported farmers and workers and eliminated local bullies. Therefore, those in the countryside with more assets often moved to Shanghai with their belongings to live as gentlemen of leisure to avoid disaster.</p>
<p>(3) Rent increases began after the Xin Jiao financial crisis in the tenth year of the Republic [1921], and rose year by year. At that time, Shanghai was benefiting from the post-World War I recovery, and various businesses flourished. Those seeking employment flocked to Shanghai, and the need for housing was keenly felt.</p>
<p>(4) After the capital was established in Nanjing, important figures built residences in Shanghai, which implicitly became the Tianjin of the north. Those from various provinces seeking employment also used Shanghai as a place to travel to and from, and as a place for planning.</p>
<p>(5) The trade of Shanghai Port has been developing and increasing year by year, and the prosperity of the real estate industry is also a natural result.</p>
<p>(6) Due to the years of banditry and communism in the interior, Shanghai has been regarded as the only safe area for investment, and idle capital has been concentrated in Shanghai. Seeking a way out, they lacked the ability to invest in industry and commerce, and were afraid of losses. Speculating in cotton yarn and gold markets was too risky. Keeping money in banks yielded too little interest. Ultimately, only real estate and public bonds were relatively reliable, so they invested in them. In the financial industry, deposits suddenly increased significantly, but there was no way to spend them, so real estate and public bonds became the only investments. This is why the real estate industry has not been affected by the world economic panic and has instead prospered.</p>
<p>(7) The buying, selling, and mortgaging of real estate on the market is very convenient, and therefore more and more people are engaged in it.</p>
<p>The above is only a brief description of the reasons for the development of the real estate industry in recent years. I dare not say that all the reasons for its development have been exhausted here. Now let's talk about the origins of high rents:</p>
<p>(1) Due to the high price of land. Shanghai's land prices have increased nearly tenfold compared to thirty years ago. Even the land prices in the past three years have gradually increased, with increases of between 30% and 40% when compared to each other. This increase in land prices is, of course, the only reason for high rents.</p>
<p>(2) Due to the high cost of materials for carpentry and construction. In recent years, almost all building materials have come from abroad. Since gold is expensive and silver is cheap, all materials imported from abroad have become more expensive, and wages are also much higher than in the past. The cost of construction has increased, and the rent charged is naturally high. However, since the United Kingdom and Japan successively abandoned the gold standard, and the United States followed suit last spring, exchange rates have fallen, and materials should also be much cheaper in the last two or three years.</p>
<p>(3) Due to the increasing sophistication of building equipment. In recent years, the Chinese people's pursuit of enjoyment has progressed more than their pursuit of production. Everything is feared not to be Westernized or comfortable enough. Therefore, the style of houses is striving for novelty. The interior decoration should be exquisite. The cost of building houses has also increased considerably as a result.</p>
<p>(4) Due to the prevalence of rental agents. Rental agents often raise rents, collect excessive small rent digging fees and other tips, exploit tenants, and cause no small amount of harm. They also use repairs as a pretext, or other pretexts, to increase rents, and if they are slightly dissatisfied, they order tenants to leave the house. As for the rental agents, their arrogance is so great that if they manage properties for foreign merchants, they almost forget that they are Chinese. Some tenants, in order to avoid rent increases, would rather let the house leak than repair it, resulting in major disasters that injure or kill people. These "Jewish-style" real estate merchants are the most common.</p>
<p>Therefore, the high cost of rent has its cost-related reasons. However, it is also caused by landlords and rental agents who only care about their own profits and do not care about the difficulties and hardships of tenants.</p>
<p>II. The Causes of Difficulties in the Real Estate Industry</p>
<p>The origins of the development of the real estate industry and high rents are briefly described above. However, prosperity inevitably leads to decline, and extremes inevitably lead to reversal. Production development leads to the panic of oversupply; increased labor leads to the suffering of unemployment. The real estate industry is no exception. Initially, there was insufficient supply, and the only worry was that there were no houses to rent. Now, there are many empty houses in the bustling city. In the past, buildings were still being constructed, but they were already rented out. Now, in addition to posting advertisements to rent them, advertisements are also posted on trams, but no one cares. The municipal government has repeatedly ordered that small rents not be collected, but many people still disobeyed in secret. Now, they are automatically waived, and some even offer one month's rent free for a one-year lease. Why is there such a great difference between the past and present prosperity and decline? The facts speak for themselves. What is the reason for this? Please explain:</p>
<p>(1) To what extent Shanghai has developed is something no one can say in detail. However, it is said that there are more than 3 million people, but no one can say how many of these 3 million people can afford the current rent. People generally say that rent accounts for more than 25% of their total living expenses. However, for those with larger families, renting a house at the current prices would cost at least half of their income. Therefore, comparing the current rent with the income of the general public, it is felt that it is too high compared to the actual standard of living and is unaffordable. Therefore, those who still have a house in their hometown have to send their families back home and live their personal lives in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) During the January 28th Incident [1932], many people living in Shanghai as sojourners returned to their hometowns to avoid disaster. The impact of the post-war economic downturn on industry and commerce has also gradually deepened. Businesses have closed down, reduced staff, and cut wages one after another. Those who previously lived in Shanghai have not only moved from large houses to small houses, and changed from renting alone to sharing rent, but have even cancelled their leases and returned home. Or, after returning home to avoid disaster, they did not return to Shanghai. This has undoubtedly had an impact on the real estate industry.</p>
<p>(3) Since the spread of the world economic panic, coupled with the fact that China is an invaded country with annual trade deficits and outflow of wealth, it has reached a point of exhaustion. In the interior, the rural economy has collapsed, and Shanghai's industrial and commercial enterprises have also shown signs of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. It is difficult to maintain existing businesses, and new establishments are even more hopeless. Moreover, once a city house is renovated, not only is the appearance magnificent, and the two-story building is rebuilt into a three- or four-story building, but the rent is also greatly increased. Those with weaker financial resources can't help but sigh in despair. As a result, newly completed city houses often change color on rental advertisements, but still no one rents them. Those landlords with more capital who insist on not reducing rent, even in the commercial center, are covered in dust and cobwebs, closed for more than a year, and still not opened.</p>
<p>(4) In the past ten years, the sound of old houses being renovated and new houses being built has been endless. Especially in western Shanghai and the western district of the French Concession, where there was once overgrown grass and desolate smoke, are now filled with summer houses and houses facing each other across the street. In the Public Concession alone, it is said that from 1921 to 1933, approximately 88,000 houses were built, with more than 32,000 in the last five years. This does not include the French Concession and Zhabei in southern Shanghai. With such a large number of houses added, and with high rents that ordinary people cannot afford, these houses are mostly empty.</p>
<p>(5) Due to the impact of high land prices and high rents, landlords are also good at calculating. Building a two-story building and building a three-story building have the same foundation, and the construction cost of adding one floor is also limited. Therefore, most of them are rebuilt into three-story buildings. This increase in one floor also has an impact on demand.</p>
<p>Therefore, the impact on the real estate industry is the decline of industry and commerce and the lack of general economic capacity; coupled with oversupply, there is today's phenomenon.</p>
<p>III. The Course of the Rent Reduction Movement</p>
<p>In December of last year (1933), the 27th District Branch of the First Special District of Shanghai, citing the reasons that the market was depressed, factories were closed, shops were closed, prices were low, but rents were high, and the lives of citizens were greatly threatened, advocated the vigorous implementation of a rent reduction movement to reduce the burden. On January 6 of this year, the Federation of Citizens of the First Special District resolved to organize a committee to carry out the rent reduction movement. Subsequently, on January 16, a conference of representatives of various groups in the city to reduce rents was held at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and it was resolved to organize the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, with 35 executive members elected. A declaration was issued, the content of which first described the situation of foreign goods flooding the market, the market withering, unemployment increasing, the economy deteriorating, and the situation becoming more serious after the January 28th Incident. It then stated:</p>
<p>"(The above is omitted) Shanghai's rents are the highest in the country. The social environment has never been as pressing as it is today. If tenants can maintain their livelihoods, who would want to cause trouble? Who would have known that at a time when vitality has not recovered and the market is declining, a small number of capitalists and real estate operators, disregarding the livelihood of the people, only know their own interests, and have repeatedly raised rents. Houses that cost only ten yuan a month a year ago now cost dozens of yuan. Increasing rent is difficult to satisfy great desires, and houses can be renovated. This has become a common practice. Society does not pay attention and allows it to happen naturally. As a result, it is difficult for tenants to afford it, resentment arises, and public opinion is turbulent. Most of the blood and sweat of a family or shop is given to the landlord, and other necessary expenses, even if urgent, can only be left unattended. Sometimes, if there is a delay in payment, in addition to the unreasonable actions of the rental agent, lawyer's letters and court summons come one after another, and there is almost no peace. If one leaves the house in anger, there is nothing to be done; if one submits to oppression, it is difficult to cope. One cannot live in peace, and one cannot enjoy one's work... In recent days, there are often empty houses in the bustling city. There are often disputes over lawsuits to collect rent. Even rental advertisements often have new rules of reducing rent by a certain amount and giving one month's rent free. This further proves that one side's exploitation is unreliable, and the other side's ability is exhausted... When the tide collapses, how can one survive? Market recovery has no future worries. Rather than the difficulty of achieving decline, why not make a small profit to last... If one can suddenly realize and automatically reduce rent, not only will tenants be grateful, but the entire society will also benefit greatly..."</p>
<p>The above is the reason and facts that the rent reduction side believes that rent should be reduced. At this point, the rent reduction movement swept the city and involved all walks of life. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce still believed, based on its stance during the rent reduction movement after the January 28th Incident, that "from a legal point of view, it is related to the contract between the two parties. From an economic point of view, it is related to the interests of the entire nation." It concluded that "how to handle it fairly should be presided over and verified by the municipal government" and expressed that it could not participate in any kind of meeting.</p>
<p>The rent reduction movement went a step further and announced rent reduction measures:</p>
<p>(1) Term: From January 1934 to the end of 1937.</p>
<p>(2) Discount: Houses built before 1925 will pay rent at 90%. Houses built between 1925 and 1927 will pay rent at 80%. Houses built between 1928 and 1930 will pay rent at 70%. Houses built between 1931 and 1933 will pay rent at 60%.</p>
<p>(3) Rent arrears: Old rent arrears before 1934 must be paid off within one year.</p>
<p>(4) Treatment: All tenants are treated equally. Property tax is still paid as before. Various schools have also organized rent reduction movement committees and have asked the mayor to express his views on rent reduction. This is a general overview of the rent reduction movement.</p>
<p>IV. The Attitude of Landlords</p>
<p>Since the rent reduction movement began, landlords have not made any clear statements and have continued to collect rent as usual. However, according to informal statements from various parties, it is believed that the reasons why landlords have not reduced rent are:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai's real estate industry is mostly commercial in nature. In addition to the properties owned by a small number of Chinese and foreign landlords and various banks, most of the properties are mortgaged to merchants after they are purchased, which can be 60% to 70%. Therefore, with 30% to 40% of the principal, one can become a landlord. Therefore, the rent income still has to pay interest on the mortgage. If unfortunately there are more empty houses and the rent is not enough to cover the interest, then a loss must be incurred.</p>
<p>(2) Due to the rapid advancement of general vehicle desires in recent years, the design of all houses strives for novelty and Westernization. All the equipment inside is more perfect than the old houses, so although the rent is high, the cost is also high.</p>
<p>(3) Land prices have skyrocketed. In recent years, land prices have skyrocketed, and taxes have increased. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has approved the deduction of the increased amount of the new valuation, the burden on landlords has ultimately increased.</p>
<p>(4) Landlords are also affected by the current economic downturn. Tenants have moved from large houses to small houses, and from living alone to renting out rooms, resulting in oversupply and more empty houses. Landlords have suffered a lot of losses; if rent is reduced again, it would be adding insult to injury.</p>
<p>(5) It is estimated that the recent eight years of new construction in Shanghai are worth approximately 500 million yuan, and adding the old buildings, it should be around 2 billion yuan. Among them, two-thirds have mortgages, and calculating at 60% mortgage, there is 1.2 billion yuan. If rent is reduced, then this 1.2 billion yuan of mortgages, as well as trust banks specializing in buying and selling real estate, will be affected.</p>
<p>(6) If landlords suffer losses, the new construction business will inevitably come to a standstill, and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of carpenters and construction workers will be lost.</p>
<p>(7) Zhabei is planning to revive. If rent is reduced, who will be willing to invest in construction again?</p>
<p>The above is what landlords consider from their own interests. Landlords believe that the reason why rent is expensive and why rent reduction is not allowed is because they have not failed to consider all aspects and express their difficult situation.</p>
<p>V. A Comprehensive View of the Rent Reduction Issue</p>
<p>The rent reduction movement has already spread throughout the city, and it is heard that tenants in some places have deposited their rent in the bank since January of this year and have not paid it to the landlords. If this matter is handled too radically, it will trigger a storm. If it is ignored, it will spread more widely. Neither of these is a solution. Even the arguments made by both sides have their reasons and make sense. Now, we can only weigh the pros and cons of both sides to study and provide a suggestion, not daring to say it is correct, but just to provide a saying!</p>
<p>Those who advocate rent reduction believe that food and housing are the most important issues for people's livelihood. There is no need to look to foreign countries for evidence. Just ask, when rice prices are high, the government actually comes out to maintain and restrict rice prices, prohibiting price increases, and punishing violators as unscrupulous merchants and then prosecuting them. Grain merchants also seek profits, and rising rice prices cannot be completely controlled by manipulation. However, the government does not hesitate to take strict measures because food is the heaven of the people, and the people cannot live without food for a day. For the sake of the people's livelihood, the small private interests should be suppressed, and the interests of the public should be protected. Housing is also indispensable for a day. Operating the real estate industry is similar to operating the grain industry. When grain prices rise, the government can come forward to restrict prices for the people; why does the government ignore rising housing prices alone? Is it that the price of "food" can be limited, but the price of "housing" cannot be limited? This is not a fair matter. Landlords argue that a contract is a contract, and once it is signed, there can be no objection until it expires. Even if there is no written contract, the previously expressed commitments are also contracts, and contracts cannot be broken. The validity of this extreme contract theory is set aside for now. Even if one emphasizes the contract theory, the law also allows for an increase or decrease in rent based on the rise or fall in the value of the leased property. Moreover, the decline of industry and commerce and the hardship of people's livelihood are current facts. Even without this situation, why can landlords increase rents without asking whether there is a contract? They can use the reason that all prices are expensive and increase rent regardless of everything. Landlords can increase rent, but tenants cannot reduce rent. Why is this so favorable to landlords and so unfavorable to tenants? Some say that the real estate industry is also tied to the lifeline of the financial industry; and those who are landlords are also engaged in other businesses. Now, if rent is reduced, the landlord's other businesses will inevitably be affected, and if it unfortunately affects the financial industry, the scale of the disaster cannot be expressed. In response to this, those who advocate rent reduction believe that most of today's securities are owned by the banking industry and are used as collateral for issuing banknotes and deposits. However, there was a sharp drop last winter, and it was not heard that it affected the financial market to a great extent. If rent is moderately reduced, will the impact be so great? There is also the argument of cost, that land prices are high and construction costs are expensive, and that the current rent is only a few percent interest. If rent is reduced again, will it not cause landlords to lose money? However, those who advocate rent reduction believe that the real estate industry is a type of business, and business cannot be without profits and losses. How many industrial and commercial enterprises are now buying expensive and selling cheap? Is it the only the real estate industry that cannot lose money? It is not reasonable.</p>
<p>We do not need to elaborate on the debate between the two sides. However, it is too much to expect that rent reduction can revive industry and commerce, and it is a dream to think that empty houses can be fully rented out after rent reduction. The current situation cannot be solved by one place, one industry, or one right. However, the fact is that tenants insist on not paying rent, and landlords ignore it. The stalemate is uncomfortable for both sides. The landlord's rent is the interest on the landlord's investment, not to mention the mortgage interest. If there is no rent income, is it not that the principal is not secured, and interest must still be paid, then switch places with the tenant and ask what you would do. However, it is also difficult for landlords to sue all those who do not pay rent, and there is no such prison to detain them. Closing them is also too much of a hassle. If rent arrears accumulate month after month, it will be more difficult to collect in the future. Rather than killing the chicken to get the eggs, it is better to cut off the arm to save the body. Therefore, it is believed that</p>
<p>(1) The municipal authorities should not ignore this incident and allow the two sides to remain entangled. They should determine a relatively fair principle under the circumstances of not being bound by law, not fearing slander, and not being moved by the situation of either side, as the basis for handling this incident.</p>
<p>(2) High rents and high land prices have led to this. The increase in land prices has also contributed to the increase in land valuation. For the sake of tax revenue, high land prices will naturally increase tax revenue. In the real estate industry, which is commercial in nature, they only hope that the property they buy today will increase by 10,000 or 5,000 tomorrow, and they can make a huge profit by turning around. Therefore, the increase in valuation is in their favor. Although the tax burden increases, once the property is sold, it has nothing to do with me. Those who buy it anew also hope that land prices will rise so that they can resell it. Therefore, the tax authorities and real estate landlords have the same goals. Land prices rise due to valuation, and valuation rises due to land prices. They are mutually cause and effect, endlessly circulating, creating today's land prices. Therefore, to reduce rent, taxes should be reduced. If the house is actually collected at 90%, the land tax should also be levied at 90% to be fair. It is heard that somewhere the land price is first discounted by 20%, and then further discounted by 25% or 40%, and the actual tax is only levied at 36% of the land price, then that should be discussed separately.</p>
<p>(3) The rent reduction standard should be formulated by the authorities based on the recent rate of increase in rents in order to seek fairness. However, there are a few points that can be considered:</p>
<p>A. For those landlords who have increased rent after the original rent amount, the amount of rent they have increased should be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>B. Those who have already reduced rent after new houses are released, if deemed appropriate, may be exempt from further reduction.</p>
<p>(4) The rent reduction method can be to give a discount on the monthly rent; or to stipulate in the contract that those who have leased for a full year can be exempted from one or two months or a certain period of rent.</p>
<p>(5) The term of rent reduction should be fixed, and the original status should be restored after the expiration date. However, special circumstances will be discussed separately.</p>
<p>(6) Rent arrears from January of this year should be paid in full from the date of implementation of the rent reduction; the rest should also be paid off within a certain period.</p>
<p>The above is not a perfect plan. I sincerely hope that there will be a wise solution to resolve this dispute. It must be known that relocation and abandonment are the means to cause harm, and if it is large, it is difficult to clean up. Weighing the situation and reason, both parties can refrain from going too far. Otherwise, even if there is temporary peace, once something happens, the old case will be brought up again, and the entanglement will be even greater.</p>

<p>丨Almost Daily New High Prices丨</p>
<p>Last week (March 19th to 24th) was the last week of securities trading for this month. Market prices, after rising sharply the previous Friday and Saturday, were already quite high. It was generally expected that there would be no further intense short squeeze. Short sellers, due to daily price increases, continued to sell, while long position holders insisted on not selling. New long positions were also eagerly pursued, leading to new high prices being discovered every day. This was a new situation unseen since January 28th. At first glance, it seemed inconsistent with the environment, but there were indeed valid reasons. The following is a description of the process and the major reasons: (Monday) Continuing the momentum from the previous Friday and Saturday, sentiment gradually rose. Bonds No. 9 and No. 16 covered their short positions, and market prices rose throughout the day, by two to seven jiao. Customs 1918 Bonds and Gold Short Bonds all saw new high prices. However, Bonds No. 38 and No. 54 had considerable selling. (Tuesday) Bonds No. 16 and No. 17 covered their short positions. Bonds No. 4 and No. 53 were heavily bought, reportedly by a certain savings society investing. The morning session saw new high prices across the board. In the afternoon session, due to Bonds No. 5, No. 59, and northern traders taking profits, prices fell back by about half a yuan. However, the pullback was very brief, and prices resumed their upward trajectory in the afternoon, resulting in more gains than losses. (Wednesday) The morning session was flat and listless. In the afternoon, Bond No. 59 covered its short position, and Bond No. 50 suddenly saw new interest, with prices rising another two to three jiao per session, ultimately resulting in new high prices being discovered. Bond No. 4 continued to be bought. (Thursday) The situation gradually became tense. Bonds No. 4 and No. 42 saw extremely strong buying interest. Bonds No. 5, No. 20, No. 54, and No. 59 either covered positions or rolled over contracts, all in significant volumes. The trading floor looked impeccable. However, Bonds No. 38 and No. 53 had selling pressure, and northern traders also sold more than they bought. Yet, market prices continued to rise even more rapidly, with each session seeing higher prices, rising another several jiao to one yuan. (Friday) The bullish trend showed no sign of abating. There was both short covering and new buying. Disbandment Bonds were especially subject to a squeeze. Customs 1922 Bonds saw an intense squeeze, with prices surging by one yuan and three or four jiao in a single session, demonstrating the pain of short sellers. As Bonds No. 9 and No. 64 were already high, some speculators shifted their targets, leading to an unconscious bull market. Prices rose another two to three jiao to over one yuan in a single day. The buyers were mainly Bonds No. 4, No. 35, and No. 54. (Saturday) The bullish trend was too strong. At the opening, forward Salt Tax Bonds pierced through 55 yuan, and Disbandment Bonds approached 74 yuan. Gold Long Bonds also surged wildly by seven jiao. The tightness of the situation made short sellers feel even more trapped. However, the rapid advance was unsustainable and likely to be corrected. In the afternoon session, Bonds No. 38 and No. 48 were heavily sold, causing a significant pullback, with prices plummeting by seven or eight jiao. Only one session was conducted in the afternoon, which turned from stability to rise, with Gold 1906 Bonds surging again by seven or eight jiao. The result was another rise of several jiao to one yuan and two jiao. Today is the last day of the month, and the volatility is expected to remain significant.</p>
<p>According to the week's activity, the trend is stable, and the tension on the trading floor is unprecedented. Furthermore, all types of bonds are at high prices, and they do not weaken slightly due to selling, but continue to advance. Near-term and long-term bonds rise across the board, because short sellers sell more as prices rise, and the more they sell, the higher the price rises. The pressure on the market price increases, and the reaction becomes more intense, pushing forward step by step without stopping. The reason is nothing more than the abundance of floating capital, loose monetary policy, lack of circulation of commercial goods, and tighter lending. The environment is stable, and the government's finances, military, and politics are gradually becoming unified. The bond market is developing abnormally. Although Salt Tax Bonds have broken through 65%, it is not easy to rise and fall temporarily, and there will eventually be a pullback, but it will not be for long. However, the wild rise of Gold 1906 Bonds is not a good phenomenon. As a result of the week's market price, it rose by one yuan to about three yuan. The total transaction volume was 96,971,500 yuan, including 21,500 yuan in spot transactions and 96,950,000 yuan in futures transactions. The results of its upward trend are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e226">Labor Strike About to Be Resolved, New York Stock Market Rises <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>According to a Wall Street Journal report from Sin Fung Foreign Firm, the New York stock market is still sluggish. However, as the auto industry labor strike is about to be resolved, prices are rising. Auto stocks are leading the advance, with Chrysler, General Motors, and Nash being the three major giants in the market, especially strong. Steel stocks also have good demand. According to an agent report, (securities) are responding to the impending resolution of the labor strike. (Wheat) The Northwest is suffering from drought, and purchases have increased, which is generally favorable to buyers. (Cotton) is making progress due to the possible resolution of the auto industry labor strike. Rumors of a strike at southern yarn factories have been denied by relevant parties. The market supply is not large, and the technical position has also improved. If there is good news, it will not be difficult to rise temporarily. The total daily turnover was 681,000 shares. Also received a special telegram from New York Standard Statistical Corporation, stating that market elements are contradictory, such as commercial expansion, legislative chaos, lack of credit expansion except for bank investment in government bonds, labor strikes, and no new capital investment, and no predetermined plans for commerce. However, on the whole, the initial stage of recovery has indeed been achieved, and commerce has shown a turning point. At present, industrial and commercial activities are still far from the normal level. If the situation develops well, it will not be difficult to expand again. This is the main theoretical basis for maintaining long-term investment. Interest rates will remain low, so medium and secondary-grade bonds can be purchased. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e227">Grain Late Rice Market Slightly Better by Three Points <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources from various groups were relatively scarce, totaling more than 20 numbers and more than 30 stones. However, the outlets were also slightly looser. For example, although both the Northern and Southern Ocean groups took over late rice packages, their intentions seemed to be normal. Therefore, only 1,300 to 1,400 packages of Qingjiao, Songjiang, Xisi, and Lian goods were entered at the close of the market. However, the market conditions did not appear weak. The sellers, because the arrival of goods was reduced and the daily quotation dropped, tried to defend themselves and were unwilling to sell easily. The situation felt tight, so the resulting market price was raised by three points. The thick japonica rice from Changbang and the shops in urban and rural areas are still sluggish, and the market color is also continuing to be weak, seeming to be difficult to revive. Fortunately, the late rice market was slightly firm, Changbang japonica rice was stable, and only medium and secondary goods such as Su Tong and Nangang were slightly devalued by three points. The higher goods had no honor or disgrace. Du Yang's glutinous rice supply and demand can still meet, which is also a settled situation. Yinbian yuan had normal outlets, and the market shape continued to be soft, but the price still had no major ups and downs.</p>

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market conditions were good due to good news from Liverpool and strong Wall Street. The number of buyers increased, and the market was lively and firm.

<p>And There Are 15,153,000 Mu of Cotton Fields Leased to the Government, it is Said</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 23rd reported on the cotton market during the week, saying that the passage of the Pengerhead proposal in the House of Representatives last week was offset by the impact of the labor strike, and the market conditions were quite mixed. Brokers settled for convenience, and inter-industry purchases were limited to price drops only. The cotton market was extremely sluggish, which was also due to the labor strike. However, the scattered transactions were still good, and the inter-industry was waiting for the development in Washington. The person in charge of the Peng Haishi proposal in the Senate, although this case will encounter some opposition, is confident that the result is good. According to the latest news, 945,000 cotton planters have leased 15,153,000 mu of cotton fields to the government, then the remaining cotton fields for production are only 24,277,000 mu.

<p>Recently, due to the need for new tea to be launched, the outlets of Qing lead have gradually become active. It is estimated that there have been hundreds of dan opened in recent days, and the price is about 15 yuan per dan. Large batch orders can still be cheaper by 1 or 2 jiao. However, overseas pricing has been increasing in recent days, and the local sentiment is still good. Therefore, there is no panic about the standard future dropping again.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the metal transaction was good. The buyers and manufacturers had trade. However, the market was more scattered and less whole, and the market was quite lively. Plain white iron, new lead wire, British steel plate, local factory nails, angle iron, round iron, copper bars and other goods were all traded. The market conditions were unchanged because the number of transactions was not high. However, a certain tobacco company threw in 2,500 boxes of futures of American tinplate yesterday, at a price of 30 yuan, 0 jiao, and a half (90-pound double-linked American tinplate). The market was better because of this. In addition, 100-pound single and double links and 90-pound single links, 200-pound company iron bars had no transactions.

<h3 id="e233">The Youth's Wrong Path <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>The tide of suicide has become even more turbulent recently. The youth, who are entrusted with the national lifeline and the essence of society, have become the protagonists of this wave, which we cannot but regard as a serious problem. This is because youth not only have strong physiques that can serve the country and benefit society, but also have full of enthusiasm and heroic spirit, which are powerful enzymes for this weak and decadent nation to rise and survive.</p>
<p>However, the enthusiasm and spirit peculiar to youth are used to bravely swallowing opium and taking sleeping pills. Regardless of their reasons for "having to die," they are ultimately events of "wringing their wrists and sighing," and I dare not agree with them.</p>
<p>The reason why these young people rashly take their lives is that some have played a love tragedy, some are due to family disputes, some are due to economic oppression, and some feel the sinister nature of society. Judging from the feelings in the middle, being in the environment, naturally there are reasons that cannot but make people germinate the thought of being tired of the world. However, their shortcomings lie in making rational judgments before death and treating their own experiences as one of the social problems. And one's own miserable encounters, by no means can the passive resistance of suicide move people's hearts, but only can be solved in the solution of the entire social problem.</p>
<p>Under the existing system, the love between men and women has become a gorgeous commodity whose price is to be estimated in the company, family relationships are the combination of forces, and economic oppression and various crimes are reasonable and inevitable. In such an environment, it indicates that the youth with enthusiasm and heroic spirit bear a major historical mission and should actively transform the current society. However, many young people nowadays, after having a setback, are as bereaved as their parents, hating the world and showing their determination by slitting their throats. This is undoubtedly "surrendering their weapons" to the evil society of reality. This may still win a little sympathy in the social group struggling in the same tragic fate, but in the eyes of people who are afraid that the people of the society will think of chaos, it is a situation that is right in their hearts and cannot but be celebrated with joy.</p>
<p>The suicide that was once extremely prevalent, even if its plot is so bizarre, special, and complicated, the ultimate reason, no matter how it cannot escape the trap of "Brother Kong Fang" (money), and to get rid of this trap, the youth who are the protagonists of the suicide trend are needed to turn their spirit of bravely committing suicide to devote themselves to eliminating the old social system that drives people to suicide. If the trend of suicide continues like this, not only will it not shatter the demons of the old forces, but it will also block the courage of the people who are wandering in the tide of the times to resist, and will lure them into self-destruction.</p>
<p>However, we, these young people who are not losing our enthusiasm, do not treat the tragic events we encounter as a social disease, but think that it is a destined fate and solve it by suicide, which is really the wrong path for young people!</p>
<h3 id="e234">The Art of Borrowing Money <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Poverty, for us, can truly be said to be the most intimate companion. It doesn't leave our side for most of the year, like a cruel demon, relentlessly whipping me, crushing my body and my thoughts day by day. Because of poverty, borrowing money to get by is naturally commonplace. Therefore, regarding the art of borrowing money, I confidently possess considerable experience. The average person must think that this is an extremely simple matter—want to borrow money, then go borrow it; what art is there, or isn't there? In reality, it is not so easy. Those who know the inside story naturally furrow their brows when discussing borrowing money. If someone doesn't know the art of borrowing money, I dare to assert that not only will they fail to achieve their goal, but they'll also surely be snubbed. It's not just a wasted trip; it's also inviting a bellyful of bad luck, which serves them right. If you ask yourself, and your life cannot avoid this matter no matter what, then you must put some effort into studying the art of borrowing money. This is not a joke; it is a skill that we poor fellows should possess.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>When poverty reaches an unbearable point, that is, when you absolutely must borrow money, before you go, you must carefully analyze all your related friends and relatives. Figure out who is more worldly-wise. You talk about everything under the sun, from national affairs to anything and everything. In short, you need to understand their personality and hobbies, and then engage in conversation that caters to their preferences. Talking and talking like this will naturally give you an opportunity to turn to the main topic. When you see that you can get to the point, move closer to the other person. Don't be bashful, don't blush, otherwise, being flustered will cause the well-thought-out words to go off track, and you'll reveal your true intentions. So, you must use a dignified attitude and calmly explain the situation. But don't blurt out everything at once. Observe the other person's expression after hearing your words, and what they say. The remaining words are for supplementing what was insufficient in the previous conversation. If the other person immediately agrees readily, that is naturally the best possible outcome. But if they don't say yes or no, and are lost in thought, at this time, you need to quietly observe their expression and see how they respond. Don't hastily press them. If they only say "Hmm" after a long pause, you can guess what they'll say next. They'll either say that credit is tight recently, and they can't think of a way to help for the moment; or they'll say that today is truly unfortunate, come back in a few days to see what happens, everyone is on good terms, and they'll naturally do their best to help if they can think of a way. Hearing such words will naturally make you feel cold all over, even anger is possible. It may be possible to borrow money from you; determine which one is straightforward, which one is stingy. After deciding, then set off, to avoid making a wasted trip, not getting the money, and losing the transportation fare or tiring yourself out for nothing. Having decided on the target, the first step is considered complete. But before meeting, you must pre-arrange the words you want to say when you meet in your mind, to avoid any awkwardness occurring at the time.</p>
<p>An even more difficult and most unbearable situation then follows. For example, you have met the person whose pockets you want to pick. You must not, upon meeting, explain your intention to borrow money in detail, because this is the most annoying thing, especially to people who have money to lend. When they hear you asking for money as soon as you enter the door, they will inevitably feel a sense of revulsion in their hearts, secretly thinking that you are truly outrageous, only remembering them when you want to borrow money, otherwise, you never show up. Although they still smile and deal with you politely on their face, your plan might fail because of this. At this point, you need to use the method of introduction, development, turn, and conclusion, that is, you must pretend to be nonchalant, as if you are just coming for a casual chat and have no other purpose. At the same time, you need to search for some trivial things to say to fill the time. If this person likes idle talk, then you might as well bring up some things that suit their tastes. If they are someone who likes to meddle in other people's affairs, but it's best to keep the anger in your heart and not show it at all. At the same time, you need to answer nonchalantly, it doesn't matter, I'll go somewhere else for a walk, I'll come back to see what happens in a few days, please help if you can. In this way, you leave room for the next meeting.</p>
<p>This step can be applied anytime and anywhere, but it's not as rigid as a formal essay. It all depends on each person's observation of the environment, adapting to the circumstances. Those who can use it well will benefit endlessly, while those who cannot use it well will run into walls everywhere. There is also one thing, which is to observe their facial expression and see the situation. If you see them putting on an ugly, repulsive face as soon as you walk in; or if they have already started, before you even open your mouth, Xiao En returned home: on one hand, he thought that the old fisherman was pitiful after being beaten; on the other hand, he was thinking that he had no money to pay the fish tax and might be beaten to death, so he sighed in distress: "Alas! How can my old bones bear this?" Guiying said: "Those are really vicious dogs raised by wolves!"</p>
<p>Landowner Ding found Xiao En's fish tax unpaid in the ledger, so he called Guo, the tax collector, over and said, "He hasn't paid the tax by the due date, intending to resist tax. This is intolerable!" He followed Guo to urge him to pay. The instructor said from the side, "That old fellow probably wants me to give him a few punches to subdue him, right?"</p>
<p>Said a lot of poor words even poorer than you. Then you don't need to embarrass yourself; it's best to leave quickly.</p>
<p>All in all, these are just some old-fashioned words. But borrowing money is always an unpleasant thing. Not only do you need to have skills, but more importantly, you need to have a thick skin, not be afraid of being rejected, and have the courage to press your warm face against other people's cold rear end. Being shy and thin-skinned, you can never do it.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Self-Analysis <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Nick</p>
<p>According to the calculation of civilized countries, am I not yet a young lad of twenty-three years old? I myself often feel too old. In terms of appearance? Over the years, running around north and south, covered in dust, the traces of youth can no longer be found on my wrinkled forehead, but this seems to be a passable matter. Why does my heart grow old, incompatible with my age? Even when there are moments of joy like a young man, afterward my heart becomes even more depressed. This seems to be unavoidable. No matter what surprising entertainment, it cannot arouse my interest. Sometimes, I reluctantly try to cheer myself up, but I'm just putting on a smile to boost other people's interest. However, I am a person who refuses to show weakness. I would rather hide my tears behind laughter and act like a young man. The mental pain cannot be measured by any scale. What can I do with my strong and stubborn nature!</p>
<p>In recent years, I have become even more eccentric. I often like to lock myself in a room, smoking and fantasizing, reliving the trivial things that have happened and the bloody traces of life, experiencing joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness like a madman. Or, I spend the whole day going to the streets, looking at the pedestrians on the road, looking at the posters in front of movie theaters, wasting time mindlessly. I remember one rainy day, I don't know what touched me to become unhappy. I put on a raincoat and went to the French park alone. The Annamese police officer looked at me with strange eyes, but he didn't check my permit. I sat in the pavilion, looking up at the floating clouds in the sky. The raindrops being blown by the wind made me feel broad-minded. Two hours later, I returned home and ate and worked as usual.</p>
<p>Even regarding the issue of earning a living, I am still acting recklessly. Being a junior clerk in this society is originally a punching bag for the big shots. When they are happy, they praise you a few words, making you feel flattered; when they are unhappy, they scold you, venting the anger they received elsewhere. And people like me are fundamentally born with the bones of a junior clerk, yet also have the ambitions</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>of a big shot. I eat other people's food and am loyal in doing my job, this point cannot be denied. But as a target for the big shots, I have changed jobs too many times.</p>
<p>Last year, I had a serious illness. I was really as poor as - San Yi (a very poor person). My uncle introduced me to a job at the home of a well-known person who was slightly famous in Shanghai. The first time, the doorman, looking up at the sky, told me that he had gone out. I felt unhappy. My uncle spent a lot of tactful words to enlighten me (actually, I knew it clearly), that the small celebrity did have important matters to go out for. For the sake of my uncle's love for me, I had no choice but to visit again the second time. It was really my fate. After saying a few old-fashioned words – which sounded even more annoying from his mouth – he hurried to see me off. Naturally, words like "Wait for an opportunity..." were something they would not forget, and he was also a very close friend of my uncle.</p>
<p>Everything is my own fault for reading too many books. However, readers, please don't laugh at me. I am a young man who has not even graduated from university, but I admit that I have read too many books; also, because I have been running around independently since the age of seventeen, my life experiences are naturally too rich, and I feel that this current society is too unable to tolerate me. Gentlemen, please don't laugh at me. Young people do not know the immensity of the world. According to my words, an image of recklessness and willful behavior is revealed.</p>
<p>I also want to fall in love, which might change things, but I don't have enough money to use for love. This is not to say that all women in the world are gold-diggers, but social expenses are indispensable no matter what. So, until now, with the heart of an old man, I am alone, acting like a madman, hoping that the sky will collapse sooner.</p>
<h3 id="e236">The Abandoned Little Life <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Guanghan</p>
<p>"Sin! Illegitimate child!"</p>
<p>"Tragic! A poor person's child!"</p>
<p>Stimulated by this kind of extraordinary tone, I stopped at the fence of an open space near the West Sea Cinema. Pushing my way through the crowd, ah! What was shockingly before my eyes was an abandoned little life! Breathing had already stopped, the small eyes were tightly closed, mud and sand were smeared all over the upper and lower lips and inside the small mouth, the tender, fleshless cheeks showed a pale white color, the body was wearing a set of blue and red floral cloth clothes, with an old scarf wrapped around the outside. This little life, just like this, in this heaven-ground coffin, said goodbye forever to this fleeting life journey, and peacefully went to sleep!</p>
<p>"About how many days has this been born?" I sadly asked an old woman who was squatting down.</p>
<p>"Only a few days, probably!" She raised her head and looked at me once.</p>
<p>"How did it die? Why is its mouth full of mud and sand?" I continued to ask.</p>
<p>"That, I don't know. I guess it was stuffed to death with this mud and sand, right? It's really tragic!" She frowned and sighed.</p>
<p>"Sin! It must be an illegitimate child!" A middle-aged woman said this way.</p>
<p>"Poor people can't afford to raise them, so they often abandon them on the roadside like this!" Another old man sighed.</p>
<p>"Tsk! It's not considered rare! You can see it everywhere in Shanghai!" Another short-sleeved man said and walked away.</p>
<p>That's right, Shanghai society is a den of sin, what strange events have not happened? A mere newborn corpse exposed on the roadside, how can that be considered rare? This abandoned little life, surmising, is probably not an illegitimate child, but the child of a poor family. Why are illegitimate children abandoned? Because they are not the product of "parents' orders, matchmaker's words," but the "bastards" of "shameless men and women;" in the current Chinese families or society where the remnants of old etiquette and inherited ideas are still pervasive, the existence of such things is not tolerated, so few people dare to raise them. Why are the children of poor people also abandoned? In the current society of unequal wealth, when a poor family is willing to sell their own blood and sweat but cannot find an employer, or is treated like cattle and horses, and what they earn still cannot support themselves, the children will often encounter this kind of misfortune. Really, whether it is an illegitimate child or the child of a poor person that is abandoned, it is a kind of sin! But who should be held responsible for this sin? Illegitimate children are also human beings, and are equally lovable; can you know that their parents did not abandon them after breaking their hearts? However, if they are not abandoned by their parents, they will also be eliminated by society. The children of poor people are also human beings, and can arouse people's pity just like the children of rich families. However, they are sometimes so pitifully close to being heartlessly abandoned by their parents; because if the parents do not abandon them, society will also force them to death. Whose sin is this? Is it really the sin of the parents themselves? Society! You are too cruel!</p>
<p>Filled with grief, I silently ran away from this tragic scene. Walking very far, I still turned my head once, and issued this kind of prayer to the abandoned little life: "May you break away from this dirty human world soon!"</p>

<p>Editor,</p>
<p>I now have a very difficult problem to solve, which is that my brother has many boring friends. He knows I have a boyfriend, and he uses coercive measures to beat my friend, and also wants money. As the days go by, my friend's attitude towards me is very cold, which really makes me baffled. Slowly, I learned the reason for his coldness towards me. At this time, how sad was my heart.</p>
<p>The friendship of the second and third years has been destroyed by boring people. I am a weak woman oppressed by the old etiquette, how can I fight with ordinary boring people?</p>
<p>I now know that life is painful, and soon I will truly be separated from this evil world. Sir, please show me a good method. I wish you</p>

<p>Answer: Your brother's friends are not only too "boring," they can simply be said to be hooligans. Your brother should not associate with these people at all, even if they have not bullied your boyfriend. So, your first step should be to advise your brother that he should distance himself from that group of boring friends in the future, holding the attitude of "respecting ghosts and gods but keeping them at a distance." This is not only for yourself, but also for your brother. Secondly, you should ask your brother "whether he is satisfied with your boyfriend;" if he is "satisfied," then you must let him not allow his friends to mess around in the future; if he is dissatisfied, or even if the "messing around" of the boring friends is actually directed by him, then you can also question him why he wants to use such dirty means. Because if he doesn't want to, he can advise you not to be close to your friend. What is the good of messing around like this; where is his reputation? To be honest, this kind of dirty trick is not only shameful, but also completely incapable of destroying your relationship. In short, your brother's friends, that kind of behavior is fundamentally illegal. If the harassment is serious, you can simply call the police to deal with it. However, for the sake of your brother's face, or because it is better to have less trouble than more, you might as well let your brother solve it for you. If he is not a fool, I think, he will definitely not sit idly by.</p>
<p>As for your friend, although there is reason for him to be cold towards you, this attitude is ultimately inappropriate, because this was neither your instigation, nor is there any need to be afraid of these people at all. As long as male and female social interactions are aboveboard, who can interfere, let alone this kind of meddling behavior; therefore, he might as well use legitimate means to deal with those people, that is, call the police to resolve it.

<p>— Cai Tonghua</p>
<p>Under heavy pressure, the hunchbacked father of Xiao Gouzi scolded his son with a stern face. The father was a pitiful fellow without relatives. From a young age, he had rented ten acres of land from Lin, the landlord, and he himself replaced the ox day and night, replaced the labor that the harvest worker should have. When he was free, he had to go up the mountain to cut firewood and grass, to use as fuel and sell to help with expenses. He didn't earn a wife until he was thirty years old, but his wife died soon after giving birth to Xiao Gouzi. The hard-earned savings had been used up cleanly, and he had no choice but to raise this only son himself. It wasn't until Xiao Gouzi was able to help him, able to shoulder the heavy burden in recent years, that he finally breathed a sigh of relief. Therefore, Xiao Gouzi could not bear to hurt his sorrowful father's heart with arguments; space was silent. The sun, like a shy girl, hid into the field over there. The breeze, carrying the scent of grass and mud, blew in bursts, making people feel the intoxicating coolness of spring. On the embankment, people returning from the town were wriggling. Flocks of crows flew from here to there, croaking loudly in the air, buzzing in people's ears.</p>
<p>"It's time to go back, Uncle Feng!"</p>
<p>A Xing looked at the crows in the sky, looked at the hunchbacked old man, whose thick veins, exhausted by work, were netted and as thin as firewood, and said.</p>
<p>"You young people can't endure hardship and can't go to the battlefield; in the past, I lived on salted rice soup, and when I worked, I was more energetic than several oxen. Alas! The world has changed."</p>
<p>He had been busy enough and had suffered enough. Yesterday's hero had passed away with yesterday's time. The old man had to stop his unfinished work. It was already late. The chimneys of each household had already emitted thick smoke, spreading strand by strand in the air. They were preparing to return. As they left, Uncle Feng looked at the green rice with loving eyes. A smug smile floated on the wrinkled corner of his mouth, "Soon purple little flowers will be blooming all over the fields..."</p>
<p>"Son of a bitch!" The farmers returning from the town cursed fiercely on the embankment.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" Xiao Gouzi rushed to ask.</p>
<p>"Dog bastards, the treacherous merchants of Song Tao, are escorting full loads of Japanese goods to sell here. The dog-shit things, and they even asked them to drink dog piss (Note) in the ancestral hall. Like us 'sweet potato eaters' (Note), we still know to hate those shameless Japanese dogs, wasting reading books."</p>
<p>People often said that they "eat sweet potatoes" and don't understand theory, and often call them "red carts" (Note) I knew but when they were working, as soon as they heard the previously thought interesting, "Hong Hong..." they said they remembered the far-off Northeast Provinces, remembered the brutality and cruelty of the Japanese army in Shanghai and the tragic deaths and suffering of their compatriots, and would curse "dwarf," and they generously donated to help Ma Zhanshan help the anti-Japanese army. In the past, they were also very modest, measuring themselves, they respected scholars, trusted scholars, but now, they saw through it.</p>
<p>"Son of a bitch!"</p>
<p>The people preparing to go home were all gathered on the embankment.</p>
<p>"Eat your own food. Why bother about other people's business? Young people, the belly is important." Jia Liang, who had seven acres of good land, coldly and contemptuously advised the young people.</p>
<p>"If you don't care, you'll become a subjugated people. Three households use one knife, you have to be checked when you go out, and you'll be beheaded if you say the wrong thing. Then you can't care." A Gen cited the words of the students who came to the countryside to publicize. The crowd was moved by these words. "Three households use one knife... you'll be beheaded... how can that be good? It's already enough for now..." They seemed to be thinking, no one moved, quietly.</p>
<p>Note: "Dog urine" - wine.</p>
<p>Note: "Sweet potato eaters," landlords used to call farmers, saying that farmers were only fit to eat sweet potatoes, only fit to be slaves, and had no knowledge, and were ignorant of the world.</p>
<p>Note: "Red cart," meaning carrying manure, is also a pronoun for farmers.</p>
