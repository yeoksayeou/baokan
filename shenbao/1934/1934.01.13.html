<h3 id="c57">勗張學良氏　廷· <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>東北淪亡。應尸其咎者非一人。而當時身任司令長官之張學良氏負責最重。故卒因去歲熱河失守華北垂危不勝環境之壓迫而去職。張氏去職之後。卽作海外遊。夫九一八之事變。國人固莫不言之痛心。而以海外僑胞所受之感觸尤深。此次張氏出遊。計首尾歷八個月又十七日之久。料與僑胞接觸之時間必多。毋怪其謂「天天受剌激。心總像火一般的燃燒着」也。</p>
<p>昨讀張氏書面談話。知其對於歐洲列强勵精圖治之成績。已有深切之認識。「他山之石。可以攻玉。」獨惜其此行之稍晚耳。張氏言今日歐洲「各國間之疑忌。比大戰之前夕還要險惡。」而經濟界之不景氣。亦爲空前所未有。雖謂各國皆在「非常時」可也。但其執政領袖何一非困心衡慮。鞠躬盡瘁之人。宋儒云。「天下重擔子惟。硬脊梁漢方挑得。」擔子之重。莫過於秉國政。張氏所傾倒之莫索里尼與希特勒二氏。皆爲出身微賤歷盡千辛萬苦一手打成天下之人。「硬脊梁漢」四字。足以當之而無愧。人民之熱烈擁戴也固宜。「見賢思齊。」張氏其有意。乎</p>
<p>吾人讀張氏全篇談話。以爲最切實者。爲關於救濟東北難民及失業者一段。其言曰。「東北難民及失業的人太多他們不斷的給我寫信。我聽見他們的困苦情形。實在難過。也急於回來。同政府商量個根本救濟辦法。」按此事一則確爲當務之急。再則在張氏亦義不容辭。深望儘速實行。以解倒懸。此外吾人又連帶想及四事。爲張氏勗。</p>
<p>㈠張氏旣往功過。且置不論。但總不失爲熟悉東北狀况之一人。卽其今日之潛勢力。亦未可抹殺所惜者不能於九一八前看透日人之野心。而預作凖備耳。今日東北已成如此局面。爲張氏計。惟有靳釘截鐵。囓血切齒以光復故土爲已任。此乃今日張氏之天職。不得謂「不在其位不謀其政」也。</p>
<p>㈡報載張氏面色豐腴與前判若兩人。此固爲有志靑年應有之體格。在昔張氏雖負國家重寄。但未脫聲色狗馬之好。自救不遑。焉論救國。望今後張氏之做人精神。亦如其體質之日就旺健。與前判若兩人也。</p>
<p>㈢世道衰微。人欲橫流。官塲齷齪。於今爲烈。張氏受此種惡勢力之包圍。歷有年所。此番倦遊歸來。往時在其左右脅肩諂笑阿諛獻媚之流。除已變爲漢奸降身僞朝者外。必將捲土重來。旣來。又必將慫恿張氏。高抬張氏出山。藉爲若輩攀龍附鳳升官發財地步。不幸張氏輕信其言。難保不一誤再誤。諸葛武侯勸劉後主。「親君子遠小人。」此二語可以轉勗張氏。</p>
<p>㈣據張氏聲明。以後出處問題。全憑中央處置。而吾人則以爲國家興亡。匹夫有責。張氏誠有救國時良方。卽使在野。亦可貢獻中央。中央如有借重之處。亦儘可隨時諮詢。好在張氏年事正富。亦正可以在野之身。爲光復東北而奮鬭此外允宜致力學問。韜晦待時。將來出任鉅艱。亦未謂晚。不觀乎各國執政大員。莫不飽嘗世故。歷經患難。卽號稱世界新邦之蘇俄。其中堅人物。亦多年在五旬以上。老子云。「大器晚成。」張氏勉之。</p>

<p>注意治安交通籌辦模範警區</p>
<p>歡迎金融實業各界踴躍投資</p>
<p>兩星期内開特别會議定方針</p>
<p>新聲社云、市政府自遷入市中心區後、其第一步、由市政當局首先作標凖、以領導市民、共同努力於新上海建設之程序、業已實現、故第二步計劃之開始、吳市長已於昨日上午在市政會議、提出報告、定有方案、並卽令主管各局、於兩星期内、造具詳細計劃書呈報、俾再開一特别會議、决定進行方針、新聲社記者、昨晤秘書長兪鴻鈞氏、承兪氏見告甚詳、茲特分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c190">模範警區 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>據兪秘書長談、市長自市府遷入市中心區後、對於繁榮市中心區之努力、異常注意、故於要日（昨日）市政會議中、卽提出繼續建設市中心區一方案、並以一都市之繁榮、首宜注意於治安交通兩問題、故關於治安方面、已决定在市中心區成立一模範警區、將令市公安局詳加研究、擬具計劃呈報、以便採擇、惟將來成立以後、其隸屬問題、是否仍屬於公安局範圍、抑直接屬於市府、尙須經最後之决定、</p>
<h3 id="c191">虬江碼頭 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>其次與市中心區之繁榮最有關係者、莫切於虬江碼頭之興築、蓋上海爲通商大埠、輪船往來、桅檣雲集、設無碼頭停泊、貨運難以上下、商務亦未由以興、故虬江碼頭、於大上海計劃之實現、實佔最重要之一頁、是以市長於本日會議中、提出討論後、已决令財政工務兩局、迅卽依照前擬計劃、更進一步、擬具一切實有效之辦法、呈報市府决擇、俾使早日實現、</p>
<h3 id="c192">歡迎投資 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>此外市長認爲一個都市之建設、若僅憑政府之力量、其效力亦祗有限、必須全民力爲之後盾、有金融界實業界之踴躍投資、故該項方案之中、對於市中心區一切建設、歡迎市民踴躍投資、對於投資辦法、將由市府確實擬訂、正式發表</p>
<h3 id="c193">特别會議 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>上述三種計劃、限主管各局於兩星期内、擬訂完備、呈報來府、以便彙集併案討論、市府俟各局呈報後、當於兩星期中、舉行一特别會議、提出討論、决定進行方針、</p>
<h3 id="c194">淞滬支線 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>嗣兪氏又爲談其他市政情形云、市中心區之水電問題、自市府遷入、卽已全部完成、郵　局亦於日前正式成立、至於將來中心區内之圓路公共汽車、及南北市之電車計劃、電網計劃、以及淞滬支線等問題、皆分别輕重緩急、兼顧財力、逐步使其實現、惟現在均以建築虬江碼頭爲當務之急、故先以逹到完成該項工程爲目的、</p>
<h3 id="c195">趕築住宅 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>至市中心區住宅區之建築、自市府估價兩次發放後、亦已領去四十餘畝、現興業信託社建築之住宅三十餘所、已經興工建築、可於本年四月底完全完工、其他由市民領去之地皮、日來均已紛紛向工務局領取捐照、皆將於短期内動工開築、上海及中國兩銀行、不日卽可動工矣、嗣記者道經興業信託社所築之住宅區、則見四壁已堅、正在趕建中、</p>
<h3 id="c196">財政問題 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>繼稱、本市財政、迄今猶未恢復一二八以前之狀態、惟量入爲出、極事撙節、尙不致過於艱窘、詳細情形、財政局方面、日内當有詳細報告、敎育經費、此次雖欲開從來未有之例、致有積欠、但現在已由財政局竭力籌撥、不日卽可撥付矣、至於建設市中心區之基金、迄今仍獨立保存、蓋在一二八事變時、市財政如此艱困、猶未動用也、</p>
<h3 id="c197">改善辦公 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>兪氏又謂、市政府自遷入新屋、因感過去公文上之往來繁文褥節、毎一公事、必須經過不少手續、始能完備、耗時費事、於工作效能上、至多不宜、故本年以來、爲增加效能、力求迅捷起見、凡關於公牘往來、皆改簡手續、按照毎一事件之性質、除必須經市長秘書長親自批閲外、皆由主管各科辦理、又市府與各局往來接洽、無論已遷未遷、亦已新訂辦法、以期敏捷便利、</p>

<p>｜對於讀者在聲請書，來信，調查表所選之科目之商榷｜</p>
<p>我們從收回的「調查表」，「聲請書」，來信中對於讀者的「讀書的願望」以及「個人的環境」更加明瞭，但是對於讀者的「讀書之目的」却還感着糢糊，所選擇的科目也覺得很欠系統，不大適合，甚至有些讀者竟但知要讀書而不知道爲什麽，但知要學一專科，而不知要學那一門。在聲請書中的「現在願研究何項科目」欄内竟有不塡科目而寫着「迷茫學海不知所擇，惟亟希望有一專科研究」的；其餘大多數雖都塡有他所願研究的科目，然若照他們的科目作一指導或一「研究方法」，我們取斷定，成效大約是有限的。因爲所塡的科目不是太多，就是這種科目太過專門研究很感困難，或者不切於他們的需要：：總之，他們所選擇的這些科目，根據我們所知的讀者環境，是不能與他們的生活狀况適當地配合起來的：</p>
<p>關於「讀書的目的」我們已經在「論自學」及「我們所需要的讀書指導」上一再申述，卽「我們爲的是實用，是認識實際生活，和如何去奮鬭，以開展自已或大衆的生活。」和「讀書是手段，不是目的。」從讀者所述的目的，雖根本上與我們並不衝突，但如果祗說「是求明瞭書的内容便可得到豐富的知識」中者說「得到相當知識」却太嫌籠統。因此，第一，我們希望讀者對於「讀書的目的」有一個深切的理解。</p>
<p>我們的讀者卽參加「讀書指導」者，大多數是靑年的店員，機關辦事員，學徒及其他各種企業的從業員。他們的學識大約是高小或初中程度，他們的收入普通是以二三十元佔多數，他們的讀書時間平均都祇有一二小時。我們知道，連初級代數都不懂，就想研究愛因斯坦相對論；每天祇有一二小時的閑暇而想兼習五六種科目；連生活都祇能勉强維持，就希望能預備許多錢去購備書籍，這都非事實上所可辦到。因此，我們祇顉望他們對於他們所要研究的能獲得充公的常識，至於他們之要成爲學者或專門家，這要看他個人的努力和他的環境，我們是不作如是想的。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c220">陸神父口中的騙　瞻·廬· <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>民國以來赫赫弈弈的軍政兩界重要人物受了和尙化的業已不乏其人；過去人物，有程雪樓；現代人物，有孫馨遠；其他，在半僧半俗之間，如段芝泉等，益發指不勝屈了。受了中國和尙化的，不足爲奇；最奇的，便是民元曾任國務總理兼外交總長，民八曾任巴黎和會中國總代表，民十一曾任駐瑞士國公使的陸徵祥先生，現在做了一個外國式的和尙，身御古德衣冠，在比利時修道院立志潛修，度那古寺鐘聲中的枯寂生活，從民十六直至今年，已有七八載之久，這眞算得民國史上的特别人物了。</p>
<p>最近，有人到修道院去訪問這位昔居道揆今任神父的陸先生，叩問他對於社祖國的感想。他說：「世界，一騙局；中國，一騙國；家庭，是家人父子互騙的家庭；社會，是親戚朋友互騙的社會；前淸時代、升官發財，是騙人的旗幟；民國時代，個人地盤，是騙人的目標；前者，魚肉民衆；後者，魚肉更甚。我曾做過前淸的官，就過民國的職，我也是騙國中騙子之一；不過，現在已跳出了騙的韁鎖，恢復天賦我的本來而目罷了。」</p>
<p>陸神父口中的騙，說的異常透切，在那人欲滔天的時代，聽了他的說騙，眞可抵得一服淸凉散，還有什麽不可解的仇恨呢？唉！早知都是騙的，何必徒勞爾形，徒費爾神，徒增爾罪惡，徒起爾野心？可惜，不到這相當的時候，誰都不肯自認爲騙子之一！誰都不肯跳出騙的韁鎖！說都不肯恢復天賦我的本來面目！那麽天下便從此多事了。</p>
<p>天下本無事，騙子自擾之。</p>
<h3 id="c221">碰釘子　謝·承·燻· <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>「碰釘子」這名詞，往往與「觸霉頭」一名詞相對稱；蓋在常人的觀—</p>
<p>念中，以爲「碰釘子」是因，「觸霉頭」是果，因爲「觸霉頭」是一般人，尤其是那些自命爲摩登者所最不願意的，所以「碰釘子」同様被人們輕視了。</p>
<p>其實，在現狀下的社會中，到處充滿了荆棘，給與人們「碰釘子」的機會太多了，如果你能對它有相當認識的話、你可以把「碰釘子」看作不算一回事；可是目前的一般人，尤其是一般靑年學子，因爲在學校裏從没有嘗過「碰釘子」的滋味，等到出了學校門而走入社會，一「碰」到「釘子」，便以爲是「觸霉頭」，由此覺得社會總是萬惡的，把過去爲社會努力的勇氣减去了大半，或竟至消極，悲觀，頽廢，慢慢走上「獨善其身」的路上去，造成社會前途莫大的危機。</p>
<p>「碰釘子」在現社會旣然是免不了的事實，我以爲我們不要輕視「碰釘子」，也不當怕「碰釘子」，更不應該以爲「碰釘子」是「觸霉頭」；而我們對於「碰釘子」須要作如是觀：「碰」一回的「釘子」，便是增加一分的見識，「釘子」「碰」得愈多，愈能使你對世道人情作深切的了解；換句話說：愈能使你接近到成功之路，因此我個人歡迎「碰釘子」，我很希望我的同志多一些！</p>
<h3 id="c222">從挨被窠說起　兪·人·偉· <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>人們在冬天似乎特别好睡，希爾喬亞的少爺小姐們，差不多都有「有</p>
<p>非吃中飯不起床」的脾氣；橫堅學校放假，家裏一切都有人照顧，這是樂得在被窠裏挨一歇的。</p>
<p>不要說有錢人家，就是咱窮小子這幾天來，也感覺到在寒冷的天氣裏，起床穿衣委實是一件異常痛苦，因難，非大英雄不辦的事。有時我也曾拿來朱伯廬先生治家格言裏的「黎明卽起」的句子念上幾遍，以爲這様就可以立刻鼓足勇氣，把頭從被窠裏抽出來，但一觸到外邊的寒氣，徒然又覺得萬念俱灰，毫無抵抗地又把𩓐子縮了進去；從此一蹶不振，�</p>
<p>一直不想起牀。</p>
<p>挨被窠當然可以免除暫時的寒冷，但終非久長之計；家裏一切開銷，都要靠自已身上做出來的；假使一天不起牀，就得一天餓肚子；那末，我們還是鼓足勇氣，掀起被頭，破暫時的寒冷，圖永久的舒服？</p>
<p>我們的義勇軍，自從前無糧草子彈，後無救兵接濟，經不起敵人科學利器的襲擊，終於一蹶不振。現在的所謂抗日英雄，有的是在山上休養；有的是在上海擦皮鞋，拉黃包車，這與經不起寒冷，而祗得挨被窠的人，有什麽兩様呢。</p>
<p>我們的國家，自從辛亥革命以還，一向是内憂外患，相煎相逼，經不起帝國主義者經濟與武力的侵略，雖然弄得農村破産，都市崩潰，但直到現在，一些兒都没有醒悟，這與挨被窠，而食暫時的安樂，又有什麽兩様呢？</p>

<p>社會，是人與人相處纔能組織起來的，恰好比是一個戲班子一様的行徑。一個人處身社會，猶之戲班子裏的一個角色，戲班裏有生且凈丑大面二花，社會中有善惡忠良奸盜邪淫，所以看一齣戲，就彷彿在那裏看一幕社會的縮影。不過戲班裏的角色，要掌班的來推派的，社會上的羣衆，那是在個人自已的行爲來取决的，表現的。</p>
<p>做一個人，最好是與世無爭，爾爲爾，我爲我，假使做不到這様，那末就要加入社會來扮一回角色了。但與其在社會上串一個白面奸臣，和十惡不赦的小花面，還不如來上個光明磊落的正派鬚生，和風流儒雅的小生玩玩，比較來得有趣些。</p>
<p>因爲做一世人，僅僅只有幾十寒暑，何必做得窮凶極惡，强取毫奪的被人唾駡，被人不齒呢倒不如放得漂亮些、做個堂堂奇男子，昻藏大丈夫。</p>
<p>世間有一種人，往往自作聰敏，『見兇　住見善欺，』「看見大佛得得拜，看見小佛踢一脚，」還加滿身是錢，裝作天下第一等首富，驕慢肆暴，對朋友處處要用手段，人家讓他一些，他就着着佔先，古諺道得好：「人有千算，天只一算，」雖則那些迷信話不是二十世紀的人所應當說的，但因果之說，西人也很講究，我來勸勸世人，走路不要走盡，不要以爲有錢就能『賣人』的，要知道，世道雖成鬼蜮，公理還是存在，奉勸莫再作「小花面，」還是改改「正派鬚生」玩玩吧。</p>

<p>這日天氣旣好，來看紅葉的人，却也不少，西山飯店樓下，二三十副座頭，人都坐滿了。沿山涯下一片平地，擺有七八輛汽車。還有兩輛汽車上，挿着軍用旗。趙翁拖着棗木棍子向積之低聲道：甘先生，你瞧，這裏男男女女，人可不少，有像我這様穿了藍布夾襖，拖着棗木棍子的嗎？積之笑道：他們開飯店，我們來花錢，我們又不欠少他分文，我們穿什麽衣服他管得着嗎？他說着，果然，不顧忌什麽，走到茶座裏面去。但是這裏各副座頭，没有一個空位子。穿行過去，在一道天橋底下，有一片平平的坦地，後面是山坡，前面是花圃，有四把藤椅，兩張茶几，却還不曾有人坐下。因爲這裏向前的正面，被一帶樹木籬笆遮住了，不能望遠，只有掉轉身來看屋後的山色。積之正是要看山上的紅葉，就向趙翁笑道：來看紅葉的人，有這様的地方不坐，却要擠到食坐裏外去吃西餐喝咖啡，這不是笑話嗎？請坐請坐！於是搬了一把籐椅子，面山擺着，在袖子裏抽出一條手絹來，向椅子上不住撣灰。趙翁道了一聲不敢當，也就坐下了。這飯店裏茶房，看到積之穿了一身西服，舉動又很大方，不像是窮人，也就過來張羅茶點，只是對於趙翁多看兩眼而已。趙翁斜躺在藤椅上，向對面山上一看，那參差的廟宇，在疏落的樹木裏面，有一大半，露將出來。在山凹裏，偶然有一兩顆紅樹，被陽光照着，很是鮮艶奪目。趙翁指着笑道：這就够了，若滿山都是紅葉：：他這句話還没有說完，有一大捧瓜子壳由天上落下了，灑了滿頭滿身。（二九○）</p>

<h3 id="c261">測量成音週率放大之綫路 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 王璇生</p>
<p>無綫電波經收音機之檢波器（Detector)改爲成音週率(Audiofrequenoy)再經眞空管(VacuumTube)放大，則其音量可增强若干倍，使用下列之綫路可以測知放大之數値。</p>
<p>圖内，阻力Ｒ１，及Ｒ２應爲相等量，其値可至Loooo歐姆。Ｒ爲較低之阻力，由成音週率交流發電機供給之電壓及已决定的信號之强度而定其値之大小，r爲一直綫式或圓形式之滑動綫阻力。如圖所示，將ＤＰＤＴ開關移至左邊，聽筒經Ｒ連接，及於移至右方時聽筒則接至放大器之輸出。</p>
<p>測量之方法爲一種比較方法，卽爲經Ｒ連接時聽筒内信號與經r連接時，放大器産生之信號相比較</p>
<p>發電機配製至需要之電壓及週率。電壓常配以約５弗打。週率可調整至已决定之週率帶。畫一放大之曲綫以代週率。習慣上，爲使測量簡單常用Ｔoooo週Cycles，</p>
<p>信號强度已由阻力Ｒ１及Ｒ２整理後，卽將開關向前後移動、同時r之値改變，直至開關移於前後兩地位時，聽筒内能得相同之信號强度爲止，因阻力是串聯的，因之，流過雙方之電流爲同値。電壓與阻力爲正比；因之經過聽筒之電壓與經過放大輸入之電壓之比例等於Ｒ與r之比例。故開關在前後兩地位而信號相同時，其</p>
<p>電壓放大＝Ｒ－r</p>
<p>若欲减除任何交連電容量所産生之殘餘信號，可將滑動機之一端及放大輸入之一邊接地Ground·</p>
<p>例題：</p>
<p>設於某種測量Ｒ１及Ｒ２爲５０００歐姆，Ｒ爲２０歐姆，r爲０·９５歐姆，求放大値·</p>
<p>解：</p>
<p>Ｒ１＝Ｒ２＝５００００hm</p>
<p>Ｒ＝２００hm</p>
<p>r＝０·９５０hm</p>
<p>公式</p>
<p>電壓放大＝Ｒ—r＝20—0·９５＝２１·０</p>
<p>電壓放大＝２１·０（完）</p>

<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>收音機末級低週率放大，如用强力眞空管，因此類眞空管屏流特大，擴聲器如果串聯在屏路内，便時常空易損壞。我們爲避免損失計，便不能不想保護的方法：</p>
<p>第二圖</p>
<p>第一圖</p>
<p>（一）如第一圖，Ｌ爲低週率阻流圈，串接在屏路内。擴聲器則串聯一固定電容器後，並接於阻流圈上。這様擴聲器内便無屏流通過，但是顫動的低週波，却依舊照常通行。</p>
<p>（二）因爲第一法擴聲器的一極直接高壓的Ｂ電，使用時一不小心，極易觸電，補救的方法有二：</p>
<p>a在Ｘ處加接一與Ｃ同様容量之固定電容器。</p>
<p>b不加電容器，逕將Ｘ線直通地線亦可（如圖虚線所示）</p>
<p>（三）不用阻流圈與電容器，單用一個輸出變壓器，也可保護擴聲器。</p>
<p>不論使用保種方法，最緊要的，便是Ｌ的交流電阻須與末級眞空管屏極交流電阻相等，纔能得到最大的輸出力。如果要得到最大的不失眞輸也力，那麽Ｌ的交流電阻，是好要比屏極交流電阻大一倍。</p>

<p>㈡用食鹽不許投入一杯水中，將兩導線挿入，旁附有水泡者爲負電極；反之爲正電極。</p>
<p>㈢在低電壓的導線，其正負極可用舌辨也：當導線接觸舌尖時，微微地覺得麻癢的是正電極；無味者是負電極。</p>
<p>㈡現成的天線</p>
<p>如利用電話線及電燈線作天線，本刋均已介紹。現在還有一種現成的天線：作者曾利用屋簷水漏作天線，將引入線接在水漏與屋簷並行部份，收音成績也不差。</p>
<p>㈢利用炭精作礦石檢波</p>
<p>將廢電池的炭精（Carbon）棒取出，將其擊碎，擇其較端正者浸入醋酸鉛（Leadacetate)溶解鉛或一氧化鉛於醋酸中卽得）溶液中，隔數分鐘取出；用硫化鈣(Calciumsulpbide)散於炭精各部，再用硫酸塗於表面卽得。</p>

<h3 id="c267">（二十三）眞空管檢波器 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 黃鑑村</p>
<p>㈠眞空管檢波：無論何種方式的收音機，都必須有檢波製置，使由天綫所接收進來的射電週率電流，得變成成音週率電流。眞空管因具有整流作用，故可作檢波之用。而利用眞空管檢波的收音機，則稱曰眞空管檢波收音機，普通所稱的一燈機，就是屬於這一類。</p>
<p>眞空管檢波有兩種不同的方法：一種是利用柵漏（GridLeak）與栅電容器（(GrjdCondenser)來作檢波的所謂柵檢波法（GrjdDeteceion），另一種是不用柵漏與栅電容器，而利用Ｃ電池的所謂屏檢法（PlateDetectjoo）。</p>
<p>㈡屏檢波法：眞空管的屏電流與礦石檢波器同様，具有單向特性。屏檢波法就是利用這種特性來舉行檢波的。第一圖爲其標凖連接法。將Ｃ電池適當增减，使屏電流近於零，此時如配諧電路有高週率電壓發生時，其中之正電壓則引起屏電流之發生，而逹其檢波之目的。</p>
<p>第二圖</p>
<p>第一圖</p>
<p>㈢柵檢波法：第二圖爲柵檢波法之連接方式，其最切要者，爲利用柵極與燈絲間之所謂柵電流的單向性，而舉行檢波作用者。當柵電壓爲正時，柵極與燈絲間有柵電流流通，反之，如柵電壓爲負時，則無柵電流。故當配諧電路有高週率電壓發生時，如電壓爲正，則有柵電流通過，其結果則在柵漏（Ｒg)與柵電容器(Ｃg)之兩端必引起成音電壓。此種成音電壓被放大而發生於屏電路，然後變成成音電流流入聽筒。在此方法，眞空管兼司檢波與放大兩種作用。</p>
<p>㈣兩檢波法之比較：上述兩檢波法各有其得失，孰優孰劣，不能一概而論，惟柵檢波靈敏度較優，用者頗夥。茲將兩者之得失比較列表於下。</p>

<p>得粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、均續見俏之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥雖小四五角左右、坎拿大不動、惟市塲人心、以廠方拉進近期、人心自然良好、更以泰皇島帮、略有現期粉生意、人心自愈振作、本月份曾高至一角六分、二月份亦帶好近分、不過天津帮仍有回出、故其餘月份、均呈平勢、迨至下午開盤、因傳廠家有回出之象、本月份亦有吐出、列因天津帮始終抛售、致市氣反步步下落、（聞天津現貨祇二元二角五六分）跌勢頗盛、結果本月份反小五厘、二月份跌一分、三月份跌一分二厘半、四月份跌一分、五六月份跌一分半、</p>
<h3 id="c283">淸定之期麥 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致平穩、因洋麥雖報小四五角、不過市塲之抛户、實在稀少、外行旣少問訊、業中人亦多觀望、所以交易、均異常淸淡、但此種情形、恐須入春後、方有生機也、結果二月份好三分、三月份好一分、六月份好二分、餘無出入、現麥到銷兩乏、存底亦微、貨主心思甚堅、高車麥又喊價至四元一角以上云、</p>
<h3 id="c284">厚粳湧到續跌角許 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源又湧、計到厚粳及各花色五十號、約七千餘石、晚稻三十餘號四五千石、晚稻去路客家因鑒市色已呈底盤、都有進採之意、故形勢初市開手作客卽頗踴躍、售方遂相繼扳緊、然事與願違、客家懷抱逈異、致結果如唐沽天津威海衛等帮共進四千餘包、以吃盤嚴厲、市色終難起立、猶屬平定之局、緣觀以上度後、其趨向未必有若何之樂觀、厚粳及杜尖洋究以供過於求、尙乏轉機之能、行情卒再下垂數分至角許、變陰元時之所需、市呈堅定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮到船六十四五號、市上各貨去胃淸淡、白粳白元高貨略小數分、中次價小角許、羊杜埠尖價疲五分、早薄稻陰元亦呈疲象、客尖定立、</p>

<p>｜客秈復有泉州辦裝｜</p>
<p>昨客秈市况、本在看小中、因本街以價小合划、續有購辦、閩省垣仍以時局不靖未辦、但泉州帮則趁小問津、市上人心稍定、行情亦得疲定、後市各本客胃口再旺、市面當可轉機、因目下存到兩步、一經大帮暢辦、市而卽可恢復也、全日售開湖南機油一百包、價七元二角七分、砶靖三百包、價五元八角七分至五元八角、南京廠機秈二百八十七包、京秈爲泉州辦去、其餘均爲本街辦去、今年米收豐稔、糯米尤多、糯米去路大半爲消耗之製酒與工業上及茶食店粢飯担等、並非如粳秈米爲人生必需品、近年時局與經濟均趨惡化、消耗去路當然减少、故元米市價步小、反低於粳米之售價、近日河下續到外、客元到申亦多、前日新到江西次機元八百數十包、頗少過問、昨日本街辦去五十三包、减價至六元半、較前市小二角半、比上月小半元、高客元售價仍高、昨裕泰配與本街米店湖南高機元三十包、價至七八元八角、但去路不同、而售價終不肯低也、</p>

<p>昨日糖市、趨勢忽又平疲、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨竟破入十九元關内、以十八元九角半稍有成交、比前日跌去五分、轉口貨六元三角、亦小五分、荷赤号九號十五元三角半、次十五元一角、太古糖降去角半、Ｂ嘜爲十九元六角半、ＣＷ嘜十九元半、ＤＹ嘜十九元二角、ＨＸ嘜十九元、振記一號棉白十八元、二號十七元八角、三號六角、四號四角、均跌半角、潮靑以汕頭電訊報升二角、趨勢轉穩、開千數包、價爲十二元二角至十二元、次之十一元八角至五角、最次十一元、新棉赤開出數十包、價爲十五元、片靑又開千餘箱、潮帮開八元三角、廣帮開八元半、</p>

<p>白桐油近因漢市洋莊銷路見活、續見漲勢、曾由二十三元加至二十四元五角、但價格漲後、駐漢各洋行、又有觀望態度、故交易數量、反見减少、每開一盤、祇二三十噸交易、可見洋行之心思未服、而漢口行家欲望未足、欲以趁此時機加上二十五元、致前日漢函所詳、將有開二十五元之趨勢、其實並無開出、乃昨函忽又退化、漢行有願售洋莊二十四元之表示、雖無做開、然市情急轉直下、已無可諱言、據川湘兩路、到貨將旺、且聞裝出在途者不少、漢市爲集中之地、將來到齊、數必可觀、前日漢行開進襄桐十九元五角、南支連税十九元三四角、均客規、數在二三千擔、以現市面觀、此價或可站定、惟須仍視洋銷盛衰爲轉移也、至於浙桐前幾日因見漢市轉機、市面亦聲附和、以毎砠十九元七八角送申交貨、而加至二十元零七八角、杭州行家在申售出、數亦在二三千擔、故最近市各油麻號、存積已不若一週前之單薄、更見市已由漲轉鬆、均有終止進貨之趨勢、且杭市近日到貨繼續見旺、蓋浙東各産地、鑒於市面旣漲、均思出售、大概急急於運貨赴杭、以圖趕售、省垣爲兩浙商業重心、宜乎來源日見其多也、</p>

<p>湖南純銻、近因洋莊生意冷落、而本街造幣廠及各埠兵工廠胃口亦屬鮮微、所以市情呆木、但到貨甚旺、致積存奇厚、人心奇軟、市氣衰弱、故行情步步鬆動、市塲概况亦有毎况愈下之勢、最近估盤毎噸估三百元、比前又降五元、聞大宗生意以及連期抛貨、則行情一節、亦有再廉可能、絲市</p>

<p>— 余揚</p>
<p>Ｄ。Ｖris以　生物的變異可分爲兩種，一種是「徬徨變異」，一種是「突然變異」。前者不把他的性質傳給子孫，故與生物的進化無關。生物之所以進化，全賴「突然弦變異」，因爲這纔是把性質遺傳給子孫的。這種學說，已經别的生物學家證明是不全對的。所謂「徬徨變異」及「突然變異」，其實不過是程度有差的同一回事。</p>
<p>但是不管你怎麽說法，生物總是變的，而且，無論是徬徨變異或突然變異，變來變去，却不會變回到舊有的様子。</p>
<p>這和妖怪的變化大不相同。</p>
<p>神仙妖怪都是能變的，例如猴精孫行者，神通廣大，變化無窮，牠能變各種人形，變蟲豸，變瓶子，變淸風，：：：然而，各種變化都是暫時的，過後仍得回復原形。而且，牠苦於有一條很累墜的尾巴。牠有一回和二郎神鬭法變作廟宇時，因爲没處安挿尾巴，就把那化成一支旗桿，然而只能竪在廟後，露了破綻。又如白蛇傳裏的白蛇，雖在長時間變成女人，但當酒醉以後，約束不住自已的時候，也要現出原形來，至於嚇倒自已的愛人。</p>
<p>這類的變化可以說是多様的突然變異，然而，結果實等於不變。這和某種人類的變化正復相同。</p>
<p>土豪劣紳會變成極左的社會主義者，腐敗軍閥會變成革命偉人，戲子會變成文學博士，：：：人類中間，意想不到的變化，特别繁多，但變來變去，何嘗脫掉原形，劉桂堂在三十三年間轉變五十一次，結果還不是個土匪麽？</p>
<p>卽使是暫時的變化，孫行者當要變成一隻淫賤的鳥兒時，曾感到羞慚，這種心理，却爲人類所無。人類是倘有必要，無論怎様卑汚下賤的東西都肯變的。</p>
<p>變不盡是進化，進化只限於不回原形的變。</p>

<p>人生好像有兩種態度，而且也好像只有這兩種；最好的典型便是討飯和綁票。</p>
<p>我所住的衖堂裏有兩個「主顧」呌化子，毎天中午和晚邊各來一次。雖說是呌化子，但並不呌也不化，毎次只在衖堂裏站七八十分鐘。娘姨端了剩飯出來，便迎上去，接着倒在桶裏，一面吃一面靜靜兒地等，等待第二個娘姨端剩飯出來。他們總是吃飽了還帶半桶剩飯回去。我飯後照例就要出門去討後幾日的飯錢，所以每天總見到他們兩次。毎次從衖口走到汽車站，我總是想，他們爲什麽還要活着？人們有活着的勇氣全是受了「希望」的誘惑，天天候剩飯吃，並没有一點改善生活的企圖，還有什麽「希望」誘惑他們？他們要活着，這問題我不能解决，於是想到自已。我雖不每天兩次地站衖堂，但也每天兩次地至一定的處所去。我雖不是帶了小鉛桶去接剩飯，却也帶了皮夾子去裝「工錢」，工錢和剩飯骨子裏有多大的不同？我爲什麽還要活着？比他們還有什麽「希望」來誘</p>
<p>惑我？想到這里，不覺啞然失笑，便得到一個結論，「貪生」和「怕死」原來後一個纔是因。</p>
<p>但似乎也不盡然，抱着第二種人生態度的便是反證，他們是拚死以求生，拚得過便生，拚不過便死。在他們怕死的氣分似乎比貪生的少些。也許這様說法有點語病，貪生和怕死只是同一事實的兩面。但他們要生得快活，不然寗可死去，這却是特點。</p>
<p>一是苟生以待死，一是拚死以求生，那一種對，這很難說，不過後一種總來得熱鬧些。可惜我自已就很富於討飯氣質，我常常只躺在床上，仰望着天花板，等待天空中什麽仙人家的娘姨倒下剩飯來，我的半部生活史也就是冷冰冰的。</p>
<h3 id="c315">條件的反應 <a href="#c315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— 盛煥明</p>
<p>在濛雨的晚上，我怕聽打遥遠處傳來的呼喚。</p>
<p>如果在那微響窗的雨絲中，有誰在黑暗裏喊，我就會不寗起來。這類聲音近一點，我的感觸到反較少：愈遠｜那側耳凝聲始能聽到的喚呌，是最使我憮然的。</p>
<p>大概此卽心理學上所謂「條件的反應」。</p>
<p>每一遭遇到這類聲音，我的眼前就糢糢糊糊的現出吳福嫂披頭亂髮的様兒來</p>
<p>那是遭水災後的冬天：吳福嫂的那座茅草舖已給大水浸漬得摇摇欲倒了。</p>
<p>『吳福嫂，呣，你這茅舖也該修了啊，倘使來了大風，怕會吃不大住。』</p>
<p>吳福嫂在傾斜的門口坐在『草鞋凳』上打草鞋，微微地遲疑了一下：『唔，還不大礙事，還好，我打算明年修｜我想再以撑年把總可以的吧？你說是不是？Ｘ叔叔！』</p>
<p>人們非但對她的說話，並且對她的各方面都表好感的：</p>
<p>『想拾這「破草鞋」（註）的人也不少｜眞有節氣，像她這様的寡婦如果出在前淸的富貴人家，皇上定要給她豎牌坊了！』</p>
<p>在女人們的嘴中對吳福嫂的稱贊却又不同，一個女人無論如何是不甘或是不便稱贊别的女人的貞操，不過對吳福嫂的「肯做」却誰都信服：到了「忙頭」上，或是誰家請酒，總少不掉呌吳福嫂來做帮手，她的手脚伶俐，並且不多嘴。此外還有件人人稱許的事，就是：不計較工錢。帮一日忙，少到一百文也好；卽使把點米給她，她也是笑着接受的。她不貪嘴，大大方方的一點不討人厭憎。</p>
<p>不過也有一點是爲人們微微的感到缺憾的：每來帮忙時吳福嫂總得帶她的六歲遺腹女兒來。女兒雖乖巧，但一般總以爲倒底是多了張吃飯的嘴。</p>
<p>然而在她，似乎别的都次之；女兒却一定要帶在身邊的。</p>
<p>那年冬，村裏有人說起吳福嫂欠了萬峪莊金土地一筆大債的事。聽到這話的人對吳福嫂都有點憮然，但她自已却從容地辯着：『我一個寡婦，那裏，没有的事。我還可以做着喫，你看；我的衣裳還是他六年前給我做的｜不添衣，一雙手喫總該混得出｜没有的事！』她認爲這是可怖的謡言。</p>
<p>不過事情終究掩蓋不長：已有人看見金土地的賬房出没在她家好幾次了。</p>
<p>『不欠金土地的債，便是偸他家賬房的人，哼，誰說不是，難道一雙手連二張口的飯都混不出？』『快嘴婆娘』寡婦玉桂嫂倣然了。</p>
<p>一部分的人們對吳福嫂的與論漸漸的也不如前了。有人以爲她旣欠　債，就難免要偸偸摸摸，呌她帮手過的幾家、開始有一部分女人檢查自已家裏可曾有什麽給她揣了走，雖未發見失掉了什麽，但對她已重重的加上一點不信任。「快嘴婆娘」說：她曾在城裏瞧見吳福嫂站在肉莊上。男人們則以爲無論如何吳福嫂不應該向金土地那閻王借債。</p>
<p>傍晚，吳福嫂宛如影子似的躡進我家來。她的臉色蒼白，嗓子顫着：『嬸嬸，我｜你們能借點給我嗎？十塊，最好是二三十塊：：』</p>
<p>她終於承認下她是借了金土地的債。『嬸嬸』，她說：『說來也講不過去，我借了六年了，是他死後我借來收殮用的，當時不過五塊錢，現在算起來，連本帶利，』『｜三十六塊八角了｜』她更走前一步，瞳仁發出炯炯的光芒：『三十六塊八角｜不還時，他的賬房說要把我的小珍拿去作抵！你：：：通得出一點嗎：：：』</p>
<p>母親的回答使她的眸光沮喪下來了；紅着臉，呐呐起來：『：：那末，唆，請你不要告訴别的人吧！』她一步步的　了出去：『五塊也通不出嗎｜唆！』。</p>
<p>『五塊！』她又把失望的祈求的眸光二次回過來，做做手勢。</p>
<p>誰也没有見過吳福嫂如此乞憐的神情。</p>
<p>數日後的濛雨晚上，有人在遠處用着尖銳的悲澀的喉嚨喊近來，那就是吳福嫂：她滿百是涙，汗，雨，她的頭髮散亂，瞳仁漲大，她的臉是靑的，或可說是靑灰白的。她拉起破前襟抹抹臉上的水：『呵，我辛辛苦苦只爲了這様的一個心肝，呵，不見了，呵呵，我知道｜我知道，阿珍的爺，我知道！』她喃喃的走過去了。</p>
<p>『阿珍，噯，你在那裏？快回來呵：：』在將消失於黑暗中時以她悲澀了的高昻的喉嚨喊着。</p>
<p>我憮然的注視着，暗陰陰欲滅的菜油燈，遠處：在黑暗的濛雨的那邊，夾着雨聲，和二三犬吠，斷續的傳來她的呼喚，那末遠，但又那末淸晰，我的心像是　得要沉下來似的。</p>
<p>（註）「破草鞋」：娶貧寡婦爲妻，謂之拾破草鞋。</p>

<p>再抄幾句徐其的話吧。與櫟園三信中有云：「村傖召客，攢果及盒，千家一色，不待其出，而逆知之。故文品日卑，而不免爲識者所噦，反不如夾雜之沙，雖棘齒而尙不至於臭腐也」。此公趣喩甚當，與我的主張亦正相同。我寗讚「夾雜之沙」，絶不願恭維那些易於「臭腐」的文字，雖然老大家曾經以技巧自炫，對我的話頻頻摇首。</p>
<p>㈨</p>
<p>計東云：「前歲春間在都門，有婁東某氏者，作正錢錄攻摘虞山老人，吹毛索瘢，不遺餘力。東徐語客曰，僕自山東來，曾遊泰山，登日觀峰。神志方悚慄，忽欲小遺甚急，下山且可十里，不可忍，乃潛溺於峰之側，恐得重罪，然意無恙。何也？山至大且高，人溺焉者衆，泰山不知也。客躍起大駡。然昨聞吳梅村先生盛稱東言是也」。這様的趣喩駡人，眞呌人欲笑不能，欲哭不得。今人作文，能逹此境者，魯迅先生一人而已。</p>
<p>㈩</p>
<p>蔣玢云：「時人選詩雖惡，然亦有足採者。臭泯中生蓮花，但採蓮花，勿取臭泥可也」。現在的文壇，在形式上看，眞是臭泥多而蓮花少。我輩亦當如此的選購雜誌，選讀文章。</p>
<p>㈩㈠</p>
<p>鄧漢儀譏模倣古人文者云：「詞在非今非古之間，氣在半生半死之際」，前語尙普通，後句則不能不令人拍案呌絶。一味模倣者，實際上都是「氣在半生半死之際」，可惜無人像漢儀能說得出。</p>

<p>周圻與同事云：「宋嘉祐中，未有謁禁，士人多馳騖請託。有一人號爲望火馬，又一人號爲日遊神，言日事奔競也。嗚呼！今且以日遊神兼騎望火馬矣，奈之何」？兩趣喩連繫得妙。</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>「但你總不至於也來欺騙我啦，你？」</p>
<p>筆爾覺得自已感動到簡直想把他抱吻起來：</p>
<p>「可是我並不欺騙你。我在這裏全然找不到立脚地，我將充任航行大西洋的郵船上的醫生離開此地。」</p>
<p>「啊！筆爾先生！你曾經那様允許我帮助我生活！」</p>
<p>「有什麽辦法呢？我自已也得生活。我没有一文財産。」</p>
<p>瑪洛斯科反覆地說：</p>
<p>「這是不好的，這是不好的，你所做的事情。我，我祗有餓死之一途了。在我這様的年齡，這是完了。這是不好的。你抛棄一個特地來依傍你的可憐的老頭兒。這是不好的。」</p>
<p>筆爾想要解釋，辯護，說出一番道理，證明他是出於不得已；但波蘭人一點也不聽他的話，他祇憤慨於他的背棄，結局他竟說出了那種無疑的暗示着一些政治事件的話：</p>
<p>「你們法國人，你們是不守信義的。」</p>
<p>於是筆爾站起身，這回是他有些憤然了，他以一種稍稍踞傲的語氣對他說：</p>
<p>「瑪洛斯科老爹，你這人好没道理。要一個人决定去做像我所决定去做的事，那是非有堅强的動機不行；這層你是應當懂得的。再會罷。我希望再看見你時，你會比現在明理一點。」</p>
<p>於是他走出去了。</p>
<p>「那麽没有任何人對於我的出國感着一種眞實的惋惜啦。」他心裏想。</p>
<p>他在腦子裏搜索着，他想到一切認識的或曾經認識的人，在那成隊的在他的回憶裏經過的許多面貎裏，他發見了那使得他懷疑他的母親的，啤酒店裏的侍女的臉孔。</p>
<p>他猶疑者，他對她還抱着一種本能的恨意，隨後，他突然决定了，他想，「無論如何，她是猜得不錯的。」於是他便尋路向啤酒店走去。</p>
<p>這啤酒店凑巧充滿着客人和烟氣。因爲這天是個節日，那些飲客｜中産階級和工人都有｜喊看，笑着，呌着，連店主人自已都在服事客人，出這桌跑到那桌，拿去一些空酒杯，再盛着滿滿的泡沫拿回來。</p>
<p>當筆爾在靠近櫃台的地方尋着一個座位坐下時，他便等待着，希望那侍女會見到他並認識他。</p>
<p>但她在他面前跑來跑去，不曾望過他一眼，她的兩脚在那短裙底下小步的跑着嬌俏的摇擺。</p>
<p>結局他用一枚貨幣拍着桌子。她跑來了：</p>
<p>「你要什麽，先生？」</p>
<p>她的眼睛没有瞧他，她傾注全神在計算她服事的那些客人所消費的賬目。</p>
<p>「怎的！」他說，「招呼熟朋友是這様招呼的嗎？」</p>
<p>她向他視了一下，以一種急促的聲音說：</p>
<p>「啊！原來是你。你好啦。但我今天没有功夫陪你。你是要一杯啤酒的嗎？」</p>
<p>「對啦，一杯啤酒。」</p>

<h3 id="c318">文人自嘆 <a href="#c318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>本來，所謂文人也者，似乎是一般人對於賣弄筆桿的人，一種比較雅緻的稱呼，好像是旣入文人之流，便是很了不起的風流才子似的。於是乎，我頗不宜於文人自居。然而自已到底是賣文章的人，到底不妨冒充一下。而文人有許多苦楚，此乃同行皆有同感者。因此不妨自嘆一番。｜｜以上算是解題。</p>
<p>不過，文人的苦楚，眞是訴不盡，道不竭，且學着婦人家的口吻，呌奴家從何說起呢？</p>
<p>在現社會制度之下，一切東西，都已成爲商品。妓女賣肉，戲子賣喉音，交際花賣愛情，而文人者流，便是賣文度日。旣然是賣，就得要有主顧，這是一定不易的道理。那末爲了要招徠主顧，少不了要有各式各様的貨色適應主顧的需要。譬如說嫖客需要於賣弄風情，於是乎妓女必須極力裝出千嬌百媚，看戲的歡喜看潘金蓮調戲武松，而戲子只會做寳蟾送酒是不行的。大人闊客要名媛伴他裸體跳舞，而交際花只肯陪他去看看洗澡脫褲子的電影也是不行的。所以高貴的讀者要讀姪子愛嬸娘的戀愛小說，而文人只給他那種「阿Ｑ正傳」之類的作品，則又何如？假使你不善於百貨皆備，有求必應，那末你只好束緊褲帶子等死了。</p>
<p>但是，一個文人一變而爲百貨店，確是不易。有的刋物要幽默，有的要禮拜六派或蝴蝶鴛鴦，有的要不反動，而有的不正動。因此，文人要迎合各種市塲的需要，確是不可能的事。</p>
<p>再說罷，幽默中禮拜六等等，到還是偏重於形式而言，而不正動與不反動之謂，却是文人最難於解决的問題了。</p>
<p>自然，每一個人，都必然有他自已的思想，而文人之流，却更是感覺敏捷的人。没有感情而能爲文，當然是不會有的事。但是在這様的年頭，文人的思想，除「中式」「合格」之外，其餘多是字麓裏去坯子，吾生不幸，居然也是文人。而又天性乘張，不肯「等因奉此」。於是乎，我祇得深夜自嘆，願諸君勿以婊子自嘆」視之。</p>

<p>— 老牌</p>
<p>做人原是件難事，做現代的人，尤其是難中之難。</p>
<p>然而這也不過是對某一部份　氣彌重的人說的，在廣漠的宇宙間，認眞的考算起來，究竟聰明的人佔大多數，在大多數的聰明人的眼底，做人就不很難而是怪便利的事。這，就是因爲他們很聰明，能把人生體味得透澈，所以毎早打開門，就很順利的應付了。至若傻子之流，必也顧及這些，顧及那些，什麽正義，眞理，什麽理智，感情，自然弄得碰壁，展不開生路，於是就說做人難，其實難就難其　，傻也者，不通世故也，時髦些說，就是不懂現實的潮流。世故而至不通，潮流而至不懂，也就村婦都能理解得淸，你的生命應排列在圈子之外，揑把鼻子，你去哭吧，茫茫斯世，有誰憐憫你？</p>
<p>然而聰明人究竟有着怎様的聰明呢？那倒也並不是他們果眞有某種非凡的聰明，只不過就是把人生看澈了，換句話說，就是做到了通世故，懂潮流，大前提抓牢了「名」「利」，雙眼炯炯地釘着「享樂」，依此做去，就能會心應手，無往不利，赫赫然可以成爲一時代人物矣。</p>
<p>在這裏，就得搬出做人的三種典型來｜正面反面和側面。</p>
<p>正面，照理是應該說的光明的一面，然在這裏却不是這様，是指某一個人對待高層的人，至少是略勝一籌的人的一面，比如司長之上爲部長，部長太太，次長，次長娘子，這，在做司長者對若輩的那一面，就是我這裏所說的正面了。其實意義也並非如此狹隘，總之是對地位，資望，權力比較高出的人的面前的擺佈，就是正面。在這裏首先就需要一幅笑容可掬和藹親人的面幕，說起話來，倒很簡單，只要連連的應着「是是是」就够了，如果自已也還有點意思要想表逹，那就至少要誠惶誠恐，是才庶幾。别的不用細說了，如忠實必像一頭摇尾護身犬，拍要拍得嗑嚮，雖也是必要的條件，但說者已多，意義早經鮮明，毋庸贅。</p>
<p>說到反面，其實已在上面暗暗地陪襯出來了，就是指的較自已低級的人們，如老爺對待聽差，太太對待丫頭，科長對待科員，主任對待部屬，等等皆是，在這裏就得把誠惶誠恐易爲旣尊且嚴，二三十歲的中年，不妨抝鬍鬚蓄留一點點，坐着的時候，不時的乾咳兩三聲，然後兩手的食指頭可以摸摸兩撇鬍鬚，意思不用細說，只要做姿式，翻幾回白眼就够了，如不够，便可說：「怎麽這様不懂事」？於此就牽帶動了「吹」，</p>
<p>在尊嚴的佛像似的面幕下，儘可闔上着眼皮，只要吹得出口，就算了事，然而務須小心，個中的奧秘，黑幕，萬萬不要輕漏一錢，否則那眞糟了，對方吃吃的竊笑起來，可眞不是玩意兒也。</p>
<p>側面是介乎正面與反面之間，是指對同等地位的人而言，旣不能完全應用正面的法寳，也不便謬襲反面的全套，不過那兩種也有可資參照之處，善在使用得法耳。如對方是初次見面，那就得給他一個好印象，面孔要和藹可親，吹可隨時應用，若是多年老友，則可不必，却宜噤若寒蟬，大可開放一幅尊嚴面孔，不要太拘束，也不要太放蕩，務必使得對方對你有好感，在此最忌者爲純正面的謬用，往往惱怒朋友，而與你絶緣。</p>
<h3 id="c320">江灣夜行 <a href="#c320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— 奕明</p>
<p>江灣，這帝國主義砲火洗禮過的大地，我是很久的没有來吊拜了，今晚爲着了復旦大學一位朋友的邀約前往視復旦劇社的第十五次公演，故在吃過了晚飯之後，就趕快的坐着車子去參觀。</p>
<p>到了八點鐘，才宣告開幕。</p>
<p>首先現出來的是俄國柴　甫作的獨幕劇『蠢貨』，這是一幕戀愛的喜劇，在技巧上是很好的，不過，在意識上是落後的。在今晚該社的演出上，技巧也很不好，兩個重要的角色葉麗瓦波波娜和哥里格雷史米諾夫均是演得失敗，尤其是飾葉麗波波娜的王采之女士更覺生硬，雖然她是很有一個寡婦的姿態。飾僕人洛克的包時君却是很不錯。效果方面電鈴太不像了。</p>
<p>接着就是丁西林的『壓迫』，這劇的内容實在是没有壓迫的顯示，只是凑巧的吧了。在今晚舞臺上，效果還算好，一方面是演員的調和，一方面是技巧的成功，因這劇的女房客一角是王瑩女士飾的，雖然王女士並不是表演得怎様好，但她的經騐是比别人豐富一點。飾男房客的是『蠢貨』中飾哥里格雷史米諾夫的吳鐵翼君，他在這劇中的表演是比第一個戲好點。最糟的是那老媽子，化裝動作，說話各方面都不行，這或許是導演者的不注意。</p>
<p>第三個戲是『月亮上昇』，這脚本在上海已經演過很多次數了，内容還算有一點兒意思，不過也是太舊了。今晚的表演，有一半是失敗的，第一是飾人一角的李鐘麟君表演的失敗，因他把一個老頭子的說話，動作都與一個壯健的靑年的說話，動作一貫却了。飾警長的顧得剛君的表演還算過得去。其餘二個警察也還没有什麽毛病。第二就是效果和燈光的失敗了，燈光一亮一暗，這是舞臺條件所不許可的，今晚他們就犯了這毛病。水裏船在行動的效果做得不好，只見劇中人的說話，而船的動靜却是視衆不知道。</p>
<p>最末一戲是『約翰曼利』，這劇的内容是描寫一個水兵因失踪了，他的愛人因家裏的貧困不得不嫁與一個年老的人，當這女人結婚之後，她是永遠不能忘記她以前的愛人，每天總是笑着，唱着你心的曲調，結果她决定不去想她以前的愛人（以爲他死了），把一切秘密都告訴了她的丈夫。但是，當她告訴她丈夫之後，她又因聽了海潮的吼聲而把以前的愛人又不能忘記了，她悲傷的哭了，在這當兒她的愛人（水兵）突然的回來了，但是，她堅决的拒絶了他愛人的再和她在一起，最後水兵悲喪的走了。這是一幕戀愛的悲劇，意識是没有什麽的。在演出上，王瑩女士飾女主角臺麗絲是成功的。包時君飾佐厄兒也還表演得不壞。糟的是飾約翰曼利的李鐘麟君，他犯了上塲慌和不自然的大毛病。</p>
<p>看完了這四幕劇，已經是十一點多了，在黑暗的底下，離開了那廢壘尤存的江灣，回到了大都會的懷抱了。</p>
<h3 id="c321">「要改就改」 <a href="#c321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>開拓新生命的口號！</p>
<p>到了新年，大家必定有一番振作精神，以爲歲月更新，我們人事也當更新一下；於是大家忙着檢討過去，確定未來。倘然想着了自已一椿事，在過程中表演得不對，今歲應當更新一下，那麽，就有「以前種種譬如昨日死，以後種種譬如今日生，」的發咒，作爲堅决主張的表示。譬如有一位朋友，他是喜歡烟賭的，在新年中，想着了烟賭的種種害處，於是想量從今年起，痛改前非，發咒不吸不賭，但是；時過境遷，隔了不多時候，又在賭了吸了，人們問他你在新年中，發的咒，爲什麽不算用？他必定又要說今年尷尬了，因爲在年興中，吸了一次，賭了一回，已經破例了，且待明年起，當凖不吸不賭了。於是明年的新年，又來一次：「以前種種譬如昨日死，以後種種譬如今日生，」的發咒。像這様的一年復一年的蹉跎下去，因循下去，的自騙自主義，社會上很多很多！今年想望明年好，明年仍舊一圑糟！這就是大家一天天抱定苟且偸安，没有自新覺悟的結果。</p>
<p>所以：我說一個人，没有眞心改道則已，若使果然要眞心更改自已的過去錯誤，萬不要存什麽心，必定要從新年起，方才立志改過·隨時隨刻，都可以更改的，祇要發覺了自已的錯誤的時候，馬上更改，不必等Ｘ時起，從Ｘ日始的猶預着，徘徊着，因爲：「光陰一去不復返」，「寸金難買寸光陰」，豈容一天天蹉跎過去，把寳貴的靑春，從「猶預」「徘徊」的下意識中消逝啊！</p>
<p>「要改馬上就改」，是我主張的開拓新生命的口號，朋友！你要是爲一個「改過自新」的覺悟者，用不着去徘徊，就在今天起來實行吧！</p>
<p>事實上，「時代」是不容我們去徘徊啊！一九三四，一，六，作。</p>
<h3 id="c322">請服補品！ <a href="#c322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— 一琴</p>
<p>有人診斷中國的病症，都說患了「虚脫」。虚脫宜服補藥，這原不需「醫學博士」的銜頭，也可以知道的。無如德國貨的嗎啡針雖有人竭力在那裏打，終不見效。而現在東洋的補品却又來了。</p>
<p>據十一月二十三日本報所載，最近因我國抵貨運動的沉寂，日商利用時機，劣貨紛紛輸入，最近運到大批劣參，擬向本市各參藥行兜售，但各藥號因鑒於愼豐等八米行販賣日米之前轍，均存觀望，不敢公然承銷云。</p>
<p>天宥中國，連年水旱刀兵之災，農村荒蕪，民已不聊於生。今幸旣吃美麥於前，又拜賜日米於後，現在又益以補品，如何不起死回生！</p>
<p>日本人的盛情是只感的，他代我們在濼東「剿匪」，在察哈爾帮助解决馮玉祥的部隊，這算是外科治療。略我東北四省，算是「包治」，一二八呢，是給上海以至全國的人們服一帖鐵血劑，也是對將來要成爲「叛逆」的十九路軍小開其刀，現在却需要服補劑了。我想現在各藥號雖然還在「觀望」，但「却之却之爲不恭」，結果還是像日米一様照單領下的。只是「禮尙往來，我們又拿什麽來做報答呢？」</p>

<p>十年落魄；數載飄蓬。方知爲人難，何苦落塵中！今猶往昔；始起至終。魚躍嫌海狹，鳥飛恨天空。寄身猶朝露；處世若春夢！多少迷途客，難逃落魄終，只爲目前計；跋涉損殘躬，吾居天台北；日日數落紅，有朝金鎖斷；淺淵走蛟龍，一飛冲天去；撥開霧重重。舊恨新愁，幾時可盡？碌碌終日，浮生眞如夢。紅顔薄命！惟吾最爲窮！光陰轉瞬過，時節太匆匆，勞燕分飛兮；何日再相逢？空把光陰過；虚懷孔方兄！願生生世世，天長地久，遠走高飛脫牢籠！人生况味；吾已遍嘗盡，苦辣辛酸；味味在胸中。這不是動聽的歌聲；也不是淸麗的詩句，吾不會做詩；不懂唱歌，更不知塡詞。這裏僅有吾向同情者低訴的哀音</p>

<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我是二十一歲的靑年，去年六月，經戚友的介紹和陳女士發生了戀愛。不久，她說『我曾經和區君定過婚的；但兩方均不願履行，互相收回戒子，信物，並經訂有解除婚約書一紙。』查該約，語氣之間，不過是一張預備登報的稿紙，經雙方簽名，上面没有證人的簽字。在這裏，她給我的解釋是「因爲訂婚時没有證人，所以解除婚約時，也没證人」。現在，我懷疑，我和她訂婚後，區君不會來破壞，而且我倆是不是觸犯刑法？現在要想找區君從新訂立一張契約，可是又不知他在那裏。</p>
<p>因爲要避免這許未來的麻煩，有什麽完妥的辦法呢；請先生一一示敎，祝</p>
<p>您的信徒</p>

<p>編者按：愛情是盲目的，不顧利害的；你與陳女士，倘使有眞摯的愛情，還是不要去考慮這許多問題爲上。因爲一旦發現說「有後患的」，難道你就忍心割絶她嗎？你要知道，區君目下是不知下落了，呌她的前途，怎様歸宿呢？能忍心割絶的，决不是眞愛，就是没有後患，也以不進行爲是。至於你問的問題，辦法是有一個的。由陳女士出面，向訂婚所在地法院，根據區君踨跡不明的理由，申請宣告婚約無效。那張不完備的解約書，可同時附呈；因爲她至少可以作爲兩人的意思表示呀！</p>

<p>— 車輪</p>
<p>我的脚，預防麻木病針注射了十多次，藥末吃了百來包｜｜毎天吃兩包，一星期就十多包｜｜却是到現在還不曉得是什麽病和什麽原因，雖則我有一種猜測的認識，却醫官是没有對我說過的。</p>
<p>日子愈久我的恐怖也在增加，對於醫官們的帮助是絶望了！</p>
<p>虎骨木瓜酒父親送來了，我渴望着酒，此地是一滴都没有的，菜裏也無一絲兒的酒味，似乎我的每一絲神經告訴我要吃它，每一個細胞都乾渴着，並日吃了它我的病，似乎就得了保證將會好！酒酒酒，我醒着玩味着想它，睡着夢它。</p>
<p>在外面時我並没感到酒有這些力量，並且不常吃它，對它並不覺有何種興趣，然而現今對我有了這奇怪的神秘的誘惑力！我還忘不了，買一百錢陳酒，剩一半，我和珠二個人吃了還面紅耳赤的醉！現今對它的嗜好是從何而起？不差，它能治好我的病！我的將麻木的血，已循行犀緩的血，需要黃酒的剌激！｜｜但是其眞實的理由還在我處於這乾涸的沙漠中，已長久渴着喉龍，由喉龍一部的渴成了全靈魂全肉體的渴，在我細密的想像中構造成了酒的力，由渴而變爲整個的我的要求。向酒的要求。</p>
<p>酒已拿來了，是給我的，是應我乾渴的，但在一科裏｜又必需打報告給二科，被批准以後才能發下。在我們父子之間加進了一種干涉的關係。而且這關係已給了我拒絶。</p>
<p>今天我繼續打了個報告，内容大概是｜「治病雖另有藥品而藥品無效，虎骨木瓜酒雖是酒，却是藥。改良監獄中應多備良藥，在犯人們不得已而自已購買時當可發下。」</p>
<p>這報告雖已呈上，但我在呈上以後就恐怖起來。因爲我在文字中完全駁倒了二科長。雖然駁倒他的理由是正當的，在我們犯人說是正當的。然而對長官依照我們的經騐說是不應該用正當理由去反駁而祇能原受。但我因爲没有酒吃，一時的情感衝動我寫下了它，腿呀作預備着明天釘鐐吧！</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance Issues Customs Treasury Bills of 100 Million</p>
<h3 id="e34">Regulations Passed by the Legislative Yuan Meeting <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held a secret meeting on the 12th to discuss the 100 million yuan tariff treasury bill case. Zou Lin, Vice Minister of Finance, attended the meeting to report. After the meeting began, Chen Changlai first reported on the review process. Various committee members then spoke, criticizing the Ministry of Finance for excessive issuance of public bonds and increasing the government's burden. Zou explained each point. The discussion lasted two hours before the bill was passed. In addition, the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Yuan raised four additional opinions and requested a public decision from the General Assembly. The general ideas were: (1) Since the purpose of this public bond is to repay debts owed to banks, the government must know exactly how much it owes the banks and should require the Ministry of Finance to submit a detailed list of the nature of the debts owed to the banks for verification. (2) After the issuance of this treasury bill to repay bank debts, will it be fully cleared? If it is still insufficient, how should it be compensated? The Ministry of Finance should provide a written explanation. (3) The issuance of national public bonds is naturally for fiscal needs, but a detailed plan for their use must be stipulated in advance. The Ministry of Finance should submit a detailed plan of use to the Yuan for reference. (4) If there are still financial shortfalls in the current fiscal year after the issuance of this treasury bill, how should they be raised? The Ministry of Finance should provide a concrete explanation. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi submitted a proposal to the Central Political Council on the 10th to issue 100 million yuan in treasury bills, using tariff revenue as the treasury bill fund. These treasury bills are to be used to repay debts owed to banks and will not circulate in the market. After the Central Political Council passed the proposal, it was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Legislative Yuan passed it at its 44th meeting on the 12th. The original text of the regulations is as follows: Article 1: In order to repay debts owed to banks and stabilize finance, the National Government shall issue 100 million yuan in treasury bills, named the "Republic of China 23rd Year Tariff Treasury Bills." Article 2: These treasury bills are to be issued in January of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Article 3: The interest rate of these treasury bills is set at 5% per month. Article 4: Principal and interest on these treasury bills will be repaid once a month, at the end of each month. Article 5: These treasury bills will be fully repaid in seven years from the date of issuance, with monthly principal repayments. Interest will decrease as principal is repaid, for a total of eighty-four repayments. From the first to the sixty-eighth repayment, 1% of the principal will be repaid each time. From the sixty-ninth to the eighty-fourth repayment, 2% of the principal will be repaid each time. By the end of December of the 29th year of the Republic of China, all principal and interest will be repaid. Article 6: The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are designated as the agencies for paying principal and interest on these treasury bills. Article 7: The fund for paying interest on these treasury bills shall be designated by the Ministry of Finance and allocated from tariff revenue. The Inspector General of Customs is specifically ordered to allocate and deposit the amount of principal and interest due according to the repayment schedule into the account of the National Debt Fund Committee at the Central Bank, for the payment of principal and interest when due. Article 8: These treasury bills will be issued at 98%. Article 9: These treasury bills are to be in bearer form. Article 10: The face value of these treasury bills will be in three denominations: 10,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 100 yuan. Article 11: These treasury bills may be freely bought, sold, and mortgaged. They may be used as collateral when paying deposits in official matters and may also be used as reserve funds for banks. Article 12: Any acts of counterfeiting these treasury bills or damaging their credit will be punished according to law. Article 13: These regulations shall take effect from the date of promulgation.

<h3 id="e35">Original Proposal from the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan for the issuance of 100 million yuan in tariff treasury bills. The original text stated: "In recent years, the country has faced many difficulties, and expenditures have been enormous, leading to a depletion of the treasury, which has been constantly replenished by borrowing. At this difficult time, Xiangxi was ordered to take over financial management and took 'opening up new revenue sources and reducing expenditures' as the future financial policy from the outset, unwilling to increase the burden of issuing public bonds. However, the effect of opening up new revenue sources will gradually become apparent, and a large amount of income cannot be expected overnight. As for reducing expenditures, it is even more necessary to carefully consider the urgency of matters and gradually realize them. Unexpectedly, during this consolidation period, the suppression of bandits has not yet been completed, and local incidents have suddenly occurred, making financial expenditures even more difficult than in the past. The monthly shortfall in revenue and expenditure has also increased significantly compared to the past. Fortunately, the Central Bank has temporarily provided loans based on the principle of assisting the country, and the 60 million yuan in tariff treasury bills of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, which were returned by former Minister Song, have been borrowed back and used to raise cash from various banks, so as to overcome this difficulty. However, the amount of loans from the Central Bank still exceeds 100 million yuan. Now that the turmoil is about to subside, post-disaster reconstruction must be planned in advance, and bank loans should be repaid as soon as possible in order to strengthen their financial position and stabilize the financial system, which will benefit the deployment of the national treasury. After repeated considerations, Xiangxi intends to issue 100 million yuan in short-term tariff treasury bills of the 23rd year of the Republic of China to repay banks and stabilize finance. Principal and interest will be repaid once a month by lottery. The term is short, making it convenient for banks to hold them. The allocation of funds is no different from repaying principal and interest by lottery every three months." (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) In recent years, British, American, and Russian oil merchants have been competing in Shanghai, and oil prices have fallen.

<h3 id="e58">Encouraging Zhang Xueliang, Ting. <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The loss of the Northeast. The blame should not be placed on one person. However, Zhang Xueliang, who was the commander-in-chief at the time, bears the heaviest responsibility. Therefore, he resigned due to the loss of Rehe last year, the imminent danger to North China, and the inability to withstand the pressure of the environment. After Zhang resigned, he went on a tour abroad. The September 18th Incident caused heartache to all Chinese people, especially the overseas Chinese. This trip abroad by Zhang lasted for eight months and seventeen days. Presumably, he had many opportunities to contact overseas Chinese. No wonder he said, "I am stimulated every day, and my heart is always burning like fire."</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Zhang's written statement and learned that he has a deep understanding of the achievements of the European powers in their efforts to govern. "Stones from other hills can be used to polish jade." It is a pity that this trip came a little late. Zhang said that today in Europe, "the suspicion between countries is more dangerous than on the eve of the Great War." The economic downturn is also unprecedented. It can be said that all countries are in "extraordinary times." However, the leaders of the ruling parties are all people who are concerned and considerate, and who devote themselves to their duties. The Song Dynasty scholar said, "Only men with a strong spine can carry the heavy burden of the world." No burden is heavier than that of governing a country. The two men whom Zhang admires, Mussolini and Hitler, are both people who rose from humble beginnings and overcame countless hardships to build their empires single-handedly. The four words "men with a strong spine" are enough to describe them without shame. It is only natural that the people enthusiastically support them. "When you see a worthy person, think of becoming like him." Does Zhang have this intention?</p>
<p>After reading Zhang's entire statement, we believe that the most practical part is about rescuing Northeast refugees and the unemployed. He said, "There are too many Northeast refugees and unemployed people. They keep writing to me. I feel really sad when I hear about their plight. I am also anxious to come back and discuss fundamental relief measures with the government." This matter is both an urgent priority and Zhang's unavoidable responsibility. We sincerely hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible to relieve the suffering of the people. In addition, we also think of four things that we would like to encourage Zhang to do.</p>
<p>(1) Let's put aside Zhang's past merits and demerits. But he is still someone familiar with the situation in the Northeast. Even his potential power today cannot be ignored. It is a pity that he could not see through the ambitions of the Japanese before the September 18th Incident and prepare in advance. Today, the Northeast has become such a situation. For Zhang's sake, he has no choice but to grit his teeth and swear to restore his homeland as his own responsibility. This is Zhang's duty today. He cannot say, "Since I am not in that position, I will not plan for that governance."</p>
<p>(2) Reports say that Zhang's complexion is plump and completely different from before. This is indeed the physique that an ambitious young man should have. In the past, although Zhang shouldered the heavy responsibility of the country, he did not break away from the love of pleasure and debauchery. He could not even save himself, let alone save the country. We hope that Zhang's spirit of being a person in the future will also become as robust as his physique. It is completely different from before.</p>
<p>(3) The world is declining, and human desires are rampant. The official arena is despicable, and this is especially true today. Zhang has been surrounded by this kind of evil forces for many years. After returning from this tired trip, those who used to flatter and fawn around him, except for those who have become traitors and joined the puppet dynasty, will surely make a comeback. Once they come, they will surely encourage Zhang to raise his status and come out of retirement, so that they can climb the social ladder to gain promotion and wealth. If Zhang unfortunately believes their words, it is difficult to guarantee that he will not make the same mistakes again. Zhuge Wuhou advised Liu Houzhu, "Be close to gentlemen and stay away from villains." These two sentences can be turned into encouragement for Zhang.</p>
<p>(4) According to Zhang's statement, the issue of his future whereabouts will be entirely up to the Central Government to decide. However, we believe that every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. If Zhang truly has a good solution to save the country, he can contribute to the Central Government even if he is in the opposition. If the Central Government has a place to draw on it, it can also consult him at any time. Fortunately, Zhang is still in his prime and can still work hard as an ordinary citizen to restore the Northeast. In addition, he should devote himself to learning and bide his time. It is not too late to take on a major task in the future. Looking at the high-ranking officials of various countries, they have all experienced the world and gone through hardships. Even the Soviet Russia, which is known as the world's new country, has key figures who are mostly over fifty years old. Lao Tzu said, "Great talents mature late." Zhang, encourage yourself.</p>

<p>(Paris) The Franco-Soviet temporary trade agreement was signed in Paris today. The agreement contains two parts: one is the economic part, which allows the imposition of the lowest tariff rate on Soviet goods and at the same time determines their import quota; the second is the legal part, which confirms the legal status of the Soviet commercial representative in France. After the signing of the agreement, both sides exchanged congratulatory messages, emphasizing that the agreement is not only important in terms of commerce, but also has political value, and is said to be a new stage of Franco-Soviet friendship. (11th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Franco-Russian trade agreement has been signed. According to responsible parties, financial negotiations will be conducted soon after the signing of this agreement to resolve the debt issue from the Tsarist era. After the signing of the agreement, Foreign Minister Boncourt issued a statement to the press, saying that since the ratification of the Franco-Russian non-aggression treaty, the political relations between the two countries have been improving day by day, and the signing of this trade agreement is sufficient to prove this. Commerce Minister Roland Erignac explained the benefits of the new trade agreement, saying that the payment for Russian purchases from France is guaranteed by the Soviet Russian Lithrax Oil Company, which is the first time. Soviet Russian Ambassador to France Dove Karevsky also said that the new Franco-Russian trade agreement can not only develop the interests of the two countries, but also enhance world peace.

<p>The French Mega-Fraud Case Causes a Great Disturbance</p>
<h3 id="e66">Parisians Vociferously Argue and Shout in Parliament <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Crowds Clash with Police, Thirty Injured, Seven Hundred Arrested</p>
<p>President and Prime Minister Vigorously Assert Guarantee of Republican Morality</p>
<p>Herriot Moves for Confidence in the Government and Thorough Investigation of the Case</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Chamber of Deputies, amidst the indignation of Parisians reaching a boiling point, began the debate on the Bayonne scandal. The chamber was extremely crowded, unprecedented in the past five years. Not only were all the seats occupied, but the public gallery was also full, and those standing and watching from the corridors were like a wall. Outside the chamber, there were many demonstrators attempting to force their way into the assembly hall during the debate, but they were repeatedly dispersed by the police. The crowds then set up barricades in the streets and confronted the police with sticks, resulting in thirty injuries on both sides who were sent to hospitals. Seven hundred people were arrested from the crowds.</p>
<p>Radical Socialist Party leader Herriot proposed a motion of confidence in the government, using this as the basis for debate, and called for free and active judicial action to thoroughly investigate the malpractice. President Lebrun then delivered a speech, emphasizing that sound actions must be taken to protect the integrity of the republic, which was met with applause from the entire house. Prime Minister Doumergue then rose to speak, accepting the immediate debate of this case, and appealed for a calm attitude. He also said that the details of this case must be fully investigated to appease the people's anger. At first, the councilors listened quietly, but then the debate was obstructed by shouts and scolding. The speaker then announced a ten-minute recess to restore order. Socialist councilors accused the government of using deceptive tactics, and one councilor claimed that the death of Stavisky was caused by the police. Prime Minister Doumergue immediately refuted this, calling it a ridiculous fantasy. During the debate, the two sides used their rhetoric to the full, and cabinet members and councilors engaged in fierce verbal battles. The speaker later announced the adjournment of the meeting until tomorrow. Before the adjournment, Prime Minister Doumergue delivered a passionate speech, which aroused a good impression. Doumergue claimed that the survival of the current government was not his concern, and his determination was to clarify official corruption, regardless of personal feelings or family relations (the prosecutor, Pressard, is related to the Prime Minister by marriage,) and to eliminate malpractice. Doumergue also promised to find ways to punish the judges involved in delaying Stavisky's prosecution nineteen times. Finally, he asked the parliament to support the government and preserve the parliamentary system and public morality. Although the right-wing and central parties remained silent, the other parties cheered the Prime Minister's arguments for a long time. It can be seen that the government should be able to safely escape after tomorrow's discussion. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>House of Representatives Questions War</p>
<h3 id="e67">Doumergue Upholds Great Fairness and Impartiality <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Left Wing Aids Government, Right Wing Silent</p>
<p>(Paris) At the request of the government, the House of Representatives held its first meeting after the holiday to discuss questions about the Stavisky fraud case. Today, the audience in the House was packed. Prime Minister Doumergue said that after this incident occurred, the public opinion was noisy, and the House should discuss it quickly with a spirit of fairness and impartiality to clarify the truth and reassure the people. It is rumored that the Royalists will hold a demonstration, so the police around the House have been increased and closely guarded. The ultra-party councilors who tend to the right-wing, Domergue, questioned the government's political, administrative and judicial responsibilities for the Bayonne municipal bond case. Dalimier, the Minister of Colonies who resigned yesterday because of this case, stood up and said that when he was the Minister of Labor in the Herriot cabinet, he allowed the Social Insurance Bank to subscribe to Bayonne municipal bonds, but he had no other intentions. Doumergue replied that Dalimier and the then Minister of Commerce, Di Lang, could not avoid the blame for negligence, because since they had advised the Social Insurance Bank to purchase this municipal bond, why did they not examine the contents of the bond first? Doumergue then said, why did the Detective Office not immediately arrest Stavisky at the beginning of this case, and the Prime Minister should be asked to explain it, and request that a person who is innocent and not involved in this case be appointed to conduct the investigation. Prime Minister Doumergue believed that there was a need to immediately explain the situation because some people were taking the opportunity to cause trouble and disrupt the political situation, so he stood up and delivered a speech, saying that he would punish this matter strictly, even if it caused resentment, he would not care. He also said that what he wanted to do was to strictly enforce the law, regardless of personal feelings or even family relations. This statement was met with applause from the audience. Then, in the silence of the whole field, he described all the evils of Stavisky's life. Once he was charged, he was temporarily released because the doctor proved that he was ill. He had also been charged nineteen times, all of which were delayed by the court and not tried. Doumergue described in detail all the irregularities in the municipal bonds that the Ministry of Commerce should have discovered but did not. He has therefore ordered the heads of all administrative agencies to assist in the investigation of this case with a fair and upright attitude. At this point, he reiterated the words of disregarding personal feelings and family relations. Doumergue continued, he has decided to reorganize all the judicial police, and said that some people are spreading rumors that Stavisky's death was not a suicide, and it can be seen that it is also necessary to reform people's hearts. He is now planning to propose a bill to force those who spread rumors to have no way to use their skills. His conclusion asked the parliament to unanimously assist the government to maintain the current administrative system and public morality. The left-wing applauded, while the central and right-wing did not express anything. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>Daily Expenses Reach 10,000 Francs</p>
<p>(Paris) Tonight, the "Qiang Yi Bao" (Strong Righteousness Newspaper) has a very interesting criticism of Stavisky's personality, saying that Stavisky's billions of dollars have long been lost, and what remains is only hundreds of thousands of francs, some treasures, and his wife's magnificent wardrobe. Stavisky's daily expenses often reached 10,000 francs, and he paid his wife 10,000 francs a month, but what consumed his assets the most was the gifts given to his friends. It is estimated that the proceeds from his fraud were about 6 million pounds sterling, and he spent almost all of it within two years, and he died empty-handed. The "Fu Long Tai Bao" (Voltaire Newspaper) reported that Prime Minister Doumergue and former "Zi You Bao" (Liberty Newspaper) Prime Minister Aimard were arrested and sent to Bayonne today. The court accused them of sharing stolen goods, but both of them resolutely denied it. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<p>Public Opinion is in an Uproar, the People Are Shocked</p>
<p>(Paris) After Prime Minister Doumergue explained the Stavisky fraud case to the House of Representatives in a frank manner, all the councilors had a good impression. Doumergue's victory is undoubtedly certain. It is expected that after the discussion of other questions is completed tomorrow night, the House of Representatives will vote, which will be in favor of the government. What we should pay attention to in today's discussion in the House of Representatives is that the Socialist Party councilor Morale-Lacombe and the ultra-party councilor Domergue, who tend to the right-wing, delivered speeches one after another, which were enough to represent the people's shock at the fraud case, but did not cause any accidents, nor did they discover anything surprising. In 1932, when Herriot was in the cabinet, Dalimier was the Minister of Labor, and Di Lang was the Minister of Commerce. The two of them once allowed the Social Insurance Bank to purchase Bayonne municipal bonds in writing. This letter was used by Stavisky. Dalimier and Di Lang both made simple speeches today to prove that their hearts were completely frank when they allowed it in writing. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>Capital of Brazil. The French seaplane "Southern Cross" flew across the South Atlantic Ocean from the French territory of Senegal in Africa and reached the port of Natal in Brazil. It arrived here the other day and was warmly welcomed. The "Arnold" newspaper here wrote an article commenting on the achievements of the "Southern Cross," saying that "the future of commercial aviation between Brazil and Europe is unpredictable, which can be seen from the flight of the 'Southern Cross.' Airplanes have now become a useful tool for scheduled flights, and are no longer regarded as a tool for adventure. The achievements of the "Southern Cross" are far-reaching, and those who are concerned about the problem of rapprochement between nations will not turn a blind eye to it." (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The German Zeppelin airship has been in operation for five years. It has flown 35 times, covering 743,237 kilometers, taking 7,343 hours, carrying a total of 23,322 passengers, including 8,900 passengers, 20,197 kilograms of mail, and 37,531 kilograms of goods. Among the 35 flights, 22 were from Europe to South America. The Zeppelin airship once made a round-the-world flight over the Arctic Ocean. In mid-November last year, it also made a long-distance flight, departing from Europe, passing through South America and reaching North America, and then flying back to Germany. Its route formed a triangle. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>League of Nations Will Be Completely Transformed</p>
<p>Denies Intention to Control Small Countries</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail today published a conversation between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the newspaper's special correspondent, Berlais. The Italian Prime Minister said that since Germany's spiritual right to equality has been formally recognized by the two major powers, there is no reason to refuse its request to have self-defense military equipment. The Italian Prime Minister also said that he believed that Europe may not have a war for a while. He believes that the leaders of the European countries that participated in the World War will reconsider before taking actions that could cause a second disaster. The Italian Prime Minister then involved the reform of the League of Nations and firmly denied the rumor in some parts of Europe that Italy intended to force the small countries of the League of Nations to follow Italy's lead. It is reported that when Mussolini spoke with British Foreign Secretary Simon earlier, he expressed agreement with some of German Chancellor Hitler's requests. This is the first time that he has announced his attitude towards German military equipment. (National Telegraph, 12th)</p>

<p>Air Force Prepares More Offensive Aircraft</p>
<p>Build New Ships Within the Scope of the Treaty</p>
<p>Rome. The Italian Army, Navy and Air Force budget bill was passed by the House of Representatives three days ago and was passed by the Senate today. When discussing the Air Force budget, Aviation Deputy Minister Fan'er declared that Italy should prepare aggressive assassination machines because Italy is often at risk of being attacked by enemy aircraft. It is a fallacy for the general public to think that Italy only needs to prepare self-defense aircraft. It should be known that if Rome, Turin, and industrial centers such as Genoa, Naples, Venice, and Trieste see enemy aircraft within six minutes, they will be bombed. When discussing the Navy budget, Navy Deputy Minister Gavagneri declared that Italy will allocate 172,000,000 lire to build warships between 1934 and 35. The Washington Convention allows Italy to build 70,000 tons of capital ships. We have not yet used this right because the Navy and the Disarmament Conference have not yet reached a resolution. In the near future, Italy will probably focus on balancing naval ratios. (National Telegraph, 11th)</p>

<p>Paris News of the World. Madame Bonnasse, the famous seer who predicted in the summer of 1918 that the European war would end in November of that year, has now issued predictions for the future of the world this year. According to reports, 1934 will be a year of peace without any wars. The Soviet Union will be the protagonist in world peace. The United States will usher in a prosperous new era in September. Madame also predicted several things as follows: ㈠ Hitler will maintain power this year, but will fall in 1935; ㈡ There will be no political revolutions this year; ㈢ A great German military strategist and two great French politicians will die one after another; ㈣ A deposed monarch will return to the throne; ㈤ France will suffer a major aviation disaster. A team of aircraft will go and never return; ㈥ Germany will suffer a major maritime disaster. Madame foresees great progress in Russia's diplomacy and economy, and the conclusion of a trade agreement with France, which will be of great importance to the world. French politics will tend further to the left. France, Britain and Italy will reach an agreement on European affairs. The Italian political situation will not change. Mussolini will remain healthy. The Spanish imperial system will be restored. No monarchs will be deposed in any country. The crown prince of one of the smallest and most important small kingdoms will be born in the spring. Lindbergh will be a big hit in the newspapers. Madame Bonnasse does not use crystal balls or tea leaves in her prediction techniques, but only enters a state of sleep in her armchair, and then publishes what she foresees.</p>

<p>All Measures Follow the Old Rules</p>
<p>Foreign Policy Remains the Same as Before</p>
<p>The new Romanian Prime Minister, Tatareanu, addressed foreign press representatives and explained the government's policies, saying that he will continue the unfinished work of the Tuka cabinet. The new government's program and goals are the same as those of the previous cabinet. The purpose is to strive for social peace and political stability, and to implement its program with an indomitable spirit, so that law and order can be maintained. The disturbances of anarchism are very dangerous, and the government is determined to stop them, but those who have gone astray will be treated leniently to reassure the people. The government has decided to encourage all people, regardless of religion or sect, to assist the government so that they can fulfill their duties. The new parliament has decided to postpone the convocation until February 1. After the parliament opens, the government will propose several bills on financial and economic recovery. Tatareanu continued that Romania's foreign policy will be based on the principle of respecting existing treaties and existing alliances, and will be implemented with the same determination as before. Foreign Minister Tietulescu will continue to serve as Foreign Minister, which shows that Romania's foreign policy remains the same as before. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>People in Rome, Europe and here are paying attention to whether Mrs. Lupescu will cause another political storm in Romania this time. Before agreeing to serve as Foreign Minister, Tittulescu put forward many conditions, one of which was to firmly demand that the Romanian King resolutely sever all relations with Mrs. Lu. However, it is believed that the Romanian King will not want people to interfere in his private affairs. Although Mrs. Lu has left Romania, it seems that she will cause another political storm once she returns to the country, because the Romanian King will inevitably be difficult to ignore the people he loves. The Romanian King will be in a difficult position, because Lu and the new Foreign Minister cannot coexist. Lu is the Romanian King's favorite, but for the sake of the country, he cannot let him step down. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

According to recent reports, when the Mexican government deported Chinese people, many of these Mexican women followed their husbands, resulting in hundreds of people being displaced on the road from Mexico City to China. Places such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu, Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou all have them. Since these women lost their Mexican nationality after marrying Chinese people and did not obtain Chinese nationality, they became stateless people.

<p>It Was Found to Be Suicide by Gun</p>
<p>The truth about the death of Cobb, an employee of a British accounting firm in Yokohama, has gradually become clear. According to reliable sources, a pistol was found a few hours away from Cobb's body, which shows that Cobb was standing on the beach at the time of his suicide, so the body and the pistol fell into the sea together. It has now been found that Cobb quietly left the hotel at 12:45 in the morning. It can now be seen that his watch stopped at 12:55, so he knew that shortly after Cobb left the hotel, he committed suicide with a gun. Three of the four British people who were detained by the Japanese police for questioning have been released. The person who is currently being detained is Guzeroze, a naval surveyor, but the police now believe that Cobb's death was due to suicide, so Mr. Gu will also be released soon. Cobb served as a colonel in the European war, and later served as the accountant of the Yokohama American Legion Club. His wife is currently in London. The police initially thought that Cobb was killed by a car accident and his body was moved into the sea to try to destroy the evidence, but later the police believed that Cobb was assassinated or committed suicide.

<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Xiao Focheng, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang and a member of the Southwest Political Affairs Council, recently, due to Sun Ke's arrival in the south to liaise with the Guangdong authorities and to request that members of the Southwest Central Committee attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee in order to resolve all domestic difficulties, this proposition clashes with Hu Hanmin's political views. Xiao once made a statement making subtle criticisms of Sun. Later, because Sun had already reached a considerable understanding with the authorities in Guangdong, Xiao also took the opportunity to apply for leave to go to Siam to handle private affairs. It is said that Xiao had long intended to go to Siam, but was temporarily retained in Guangdong due to the Southwest Political Affairs Council's persuasion. Now, with the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee about to open, and he himself unwilling to attend, he decided to take this opportunity to go to Siam. On the 5th of this month, he packed over ten pieces of luggage and sent them to Hong Kong first to prepare everything. On the morning of the 6th, Xiao left Guangdong with his son Songjian and his family. Before leaving, Xiao told people that this time he was returning to Siam purely to handle private commercial affairs in Siam, and had applied to the Political Affairs Council for a month's leave, but if his private affairs detain him at that time, he may not be able to return to Guangdong until two months later. During his leave, if the Southwest Political Affairs Council needs his assistance, he can return to the country at any time. Xiao arrived in Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 6th and immediately visited Hu Hanmin. On the 7th, he took the "Guangdong" ship to Siam via the Shantou port. (January 7th)</p>

<p>| Constructing Pillboxes to Prevent Bandit Surprise Attacks |</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Chairman Chiang, regarding the plan to suppress bandits, previously ordered all counties and districts to build more pillboxes and defend key points, so that even a small number of troops could provide long-term defense. However, various places either claimed to be far from the bandit areas or cited financial difficulties as reasons, and mostly outwardly complied but inwardly disobeyed this construction. Chiang recently ordered all provinces that all safe zones within 240 li of bandit areas must build pillboxes to prevent bandits. The key points of his instruction are: (1) Various places often think that having a city means that there is no need to build pillboxes, but they do not know that old cities require many soldiers to defend and are not easy to defend. Often with more troops, if there are points, such as on the city walls or outside the city, that can overlook the city or form a mutual defense, building one or two pillboxes will allow even a small number of troops to defend for a long time. (2) Various places often cite financial difficulties as a reason, but they should know that being captured once will result in losses that are more than double. (3) Various places often think that because they are safe zones, there is no need to build pillboxes, but they should know that roaming bandits can travel hundreds of li in a day and night. How can they not take precautions in advance? From now on, all cities and towns within 240 li of bandit areas must construct pillboxes and prepare accordingly. The commanders of the stationed troops and the provincial government should supervise at all times. (January 10th)</p>

If the takeover were implemented, war would certainly break out. To avoid war, the naval port headquarters would not withdraw. Huang, fearing causing a war, and Naval Port Commander Lin Guogeng, through the mediation of the consular corps, agreed that the marine corps and the 19th Route Army would each withdraw two battalions, leaving one battalion each in Xiamen to maintain the status quo. When the Central Army launched a general offensive against Fujian, Military Special Envoy Du Qiyun arrived in Xiamen on the 2nd of this month and consulted with Lin Guogeng about recovering Xiamen. Chairman Chiang and the Naval Department also telegraphed, ordering the recovery to be implemented by the 5th of this month. At that time, Lin Guogeng believed that Xiamen was home to various foreign nationals, especially many Taiwanese residents of Japan. If there were military action, it would inevitably give foreigners an excuse. In fact, Japanese warships had already moved to the Narcissus Palace wharf on the 5th, with their gun covers removed. If there were battles in the city, Japanese sailors would certainly take the opportunity to land. Since the 4th, Taiwanese residents throughout the city had been flying the Japanese flag. Under these circumstances, Lin decided to resolve the issue through political means and secretly telegraphed the central government, requesting a postponement of the recovery. He also consulted with Huang Qiang about a peaceful recovery method. In fact, only three companies of the 19th Route Army were stationed in Xiamen, and there were no troops to transfer from Zhangzhou. Huang then agreed to telegraph Fuzhou for instructions. Later, he received a reply from Cai Tingkai, not allowing the transfer. On the 9th, Lin and Du received a telegram from the central government and the Naval Department, setting a deadline of the 10th to recover Xiamen. Lin again summoned Huang Qiang and informed him that the situation was such that resistance was futile. Huang agreed to withdraw. That evening at 7:00 PM, Huang crossed over to Gulangyu and ordered Mayor Luo Zongmeng to hand over the city government. Public Security Bureau Director Lin Hongfei also agreed to withdraw. Lin Guogeng then appointed Wang Zongshi, the director of the Third Branch Bureau, as the acting director of the Public Security Bureau to take over the Public Security Bureau. Huang Guanxi, the commander of the 1st Battalion of the Special Service Regiment of the 19th Route Army stationed in Xiamen, consisting of three infantry companies, one machine gun company, and one military police company, totaling over 700 men, was originally a former subordinate of Du Qiyun and had been contacted in advance to surrender. By the morning of the 10th, Du Qiyun sent Xie Jingbo, the commander of the Fujian Independent 1st Brigade, to inspect and reorganize Huang's unit and appointed Huang as the regimental commander. However, there was still a twist in the takeover of the Public Security Bureau. Lin Hongfei had originally agreed to hand it over and had Wang Zongshi escort him to Daomei, crossing the river to Gulangyu. Unexpectedly, Lin had a change of heart upon arriving in Gulangyu and telegraphed the bureau secretary Tan Yujun, refusing the takeover. Tan immediately notified each branch bureau by telephone not to hand over. All branch bureaus did not comply. Tan Yujun then ordered the special service team, security team, and military police team to take emergency precautions. The situation suddenly changed. Lin returned to Xiamen and received the report. He then telephoned Huang Qiang to discuss a peaceful solution. Huang said he could not stop it, and there was no result. Thus, from 11:00 PM on the 9th, the naval side began military deployments. Chen Wenlong, the captain of the security team stationed at the Dabei Pavilion in front of the park, was the first to break away from the Public Security Bureau and become independent. Feng Hongxiang, the captain of the security battalion stationed at Fuyu Cape, although a figure in the 19th Route Army, had many Northern and Fujian natives in his unit and had previously expressed sympathy for the navy. They also left their unit headquarters in groups of three or five and transferred to the Dabei Pavilion. Seeing that the situation was not right, Feng sneaked across to Gulangyu. At the same time, the Special Envoy's Office also deployed hundreds of plainclothes officers, distributed in the Public Security Bureau, Xiamen Port, Zhongshan Road, Haihou, Fuyu Cape, and other areas. At this time, the Naval Port Headquarters had ordered Wang Zongshi to act as the director of the Public Security Bureau, sending Special Service Team Captain Wang Chaoqu and Security 2nd Team Squad Leader Guo Zhongying to lead a platoon of security guards to cooperate with a company of marines to the Public Security Bureau. First, they disarmed the police guarding the door, and then disarmed the special service team, confiscating 31 Mauser pistols (8 missing), over 30 Qu-7 and Qu-9 pistols, 3 rifles, 3 revolvers, and some ammunition. Yang Yiming, the captain of the special service team, was detained. Then, they entered the bureau. Secretary Tan Yujun and former Heshan Police Chief Yu Lan were also in the bureau and were also detained. Lin Tianhong (Lin Hongzhu), the captain of the special service detective team, and Xu Zhao寰, director of the 5th Branch Bureau, were also detained. The overall situation was stabilized by about 6:00 AM on the 10th. At dawn, the Naval Port Headquarters posted a notice, which read: "Notice: This Headquarters has received a telegram from the Naval Department of the Central Government, setting a deadline to recover Xiamen as soon as possible, requiring the entire city to fly the Blue Sky White Sun flag, etc. Now, the 19th Route Army has completely left Xiamen. This headquarters is fully responsible for maintaining local security. Foreign residents should be given comprehensive and practical protection. This notice is hereby issued to all merchants and people of Xiamen for their information. This is a notice issued on January 10th, 23rd year of the Republic of China, by Commander Lin Guogeng." Military Special Envoy Du Qiyun also issued a notice, which read: "This Special Envoy is ordered to come to Fujian, responsible for suppressing the rebellion and pacifying the people. Commander Lin is responsible for maintaining security in Xiamen." Lin established the Special Envoy's Office in the former municipal government building on the same day. The department included a staff, adjutant, secretary, military law, accounting, and five sections, as well as a political department. At the same time, Du telegraphed the central government, requesting that Liu Guangqian be appointed as the mayor of Xiamen and the magistrate of Siming County. Liu will take over the city and county governments after the central government's order arrives. At noon, the Naval Port Headquarters appointed Han Fuhai as the director of the Xiamen Finance Bureau. Han immediately went to various tax collection agencies to take over. In addition, the agencies that have been taken over include the Tax Bureau, the Consolidated Tax Bureau, the Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, the Kerosene Special Tax Bureau, the Imported Rice Tax Bureau, the Official Property Clearance Bureau, the Sugar Industry Business Tax Bureau, and the Sulfur Business Tax Bureau. As for the Salt Transport Deputy Office and the Inspection Office, the previous incumbents had moved all items and documents to Gulangyu the night before. Regarding the courts, the Special Envoy's Office appointed Yang Tingshu to concurrently serve as the President of the First High Branch Court. Yang also went to take over and appointed Liu Liangqi to temporarily serve as the President of the Siming District Court. Zhao Bing, the original President of the High Branch Court, and Lin Chao, the President of the District Court, had both fled. The inspection system, which had been abolished by the pseudo-organization, has now been restored. Mi Anren, the Prosecutor of the High Court Inspection Office, and Chen Bin嶼, the local inspection officer, have taken office. Regarding party affairs, the Special Envoy's Office appointed Lu Duzhen, Chen Li, and Huang Xihuang as members of the Siming City Party Affairs Reorganization Committee and established a reorganization committee. They issued a notice to the Kuomintang members in the city, setting a deadline of the 18th of this month to report to the meeting for reorganization, and those who fail to report by the deadline will have their membership revoked. After Wang Zongshi took office as the Director of the Public Security Bureau, the personnel of each bureau were redistributed.</p>
<p>Torpedo Fleet Commander Wang Shouting, aboard the "Yi Xian" warship, and Lin Liang's unit, the 7th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Marine Corps transported by the "Zhongshan" warship, arrived in Xiamen from Sandu'ao at 6:00 AM on the 10th. Lin's company landed and was stationed at the Pan Shi battery. After arriving in Xiamen, Wang also landed and visited Lin Guogeng and Du Qiyun to discuss defense. Wang came to assist Lin Guogeng in commanding the fleet for coordinated defense by order of the Naval Department. After returning to the warship, Wang ordered the "Jiangzhen" to sail to Gao'an, the "Yongjian" to sail to Wutong, the "Chuqian" to sail to Songyu, and the "Yi Xian" and "Zhongshan" to be stationed at Monkey Island. The command warship is the "Yi Xian." There are currently five warships stationed in Xiamen. It is also heard that the 3rd Battalion of the Marine Corps, including the 8th Company of Lin Jiyuan, the 9th Company of Zhu Fengxiang, and the machine gun company of Zhang Binqin, will be transported to Xiamen by the "Chu Guan" warship and the "Ding An" warship on the 11th. The 7th Company of the battalion was originally stationed at Xiangshan Port. The battalion headquarters and the 8th, 9th, and machine gun companies were all stationed in Nanjing. They left Nanjing and Xiangshan on the 4th and arrived at Sandu'ao on the night of the 9th. Before they could assemble, the 7th Company received an order from Chen Jiliang to rush to Xiamen at 9:00 PM. It is also said that Chen's regiment is currently engaged in fierce fighting with Qiu Zhaochen's unit in the Feiluan Ridge area of Luoyuan, and has not yet been able to depart for Xiamen immediately. It will probably have to wait another day or two.</p>
<p>Regarding foreigners, because Xiamen was recovered in one night and there was no local disorder, although there were those who were eager to cause trouble, there was no movement. Among Fujian's international relations, Xiamen is the most complex and difficult to deal with. Now that it has been able to pass so smoothly, the people of Xiamen are quite fortunate. (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e110">Hankou Cracks Down on Fujian Rebel Organization <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Seized Seal of Pseudo-Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>The Ring Leader Tang Nanqing Has Been Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: Since the outbreak of the Fujian Incident, it has been rumored that the pseudo-organization sent party members to various places to engage in activities. The Pacification Commissioner's Office in Hubei and the Garrison Headquarters, considering Wuhan's strategic importance, repeatedly ordered their subordinates to strengthen precautions to avoid disrupting public order. Since January, many suspected reactionaries have been arrested, but most lack concrete evidence. Therefore, they were either granted bail or detained for interrogation. On the 11th of last month, the 5th Regiment of the Central Military Police stationed in Hankou cracked down on a reactionary organization in Yaobang Alley, Hankou. Five criminals were arrested at the time, and the seal of the pseudo-commander-in-chief of the 4th Route Army of the pseudo-Chinese People's Revolutionary Army, commission certificates, orders, rosters, and other items were seized. After being sent to the Garrison Department for interrogation and clarification, the ring leader Tang Nanqing was sentenced to death, and Ma Shaofu and the other four were sentenced to twelve years in prison. A telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang for approval. On the 11th of this month, an instruction from the Nanchang Headquarters was received approving the sentence. That afternoon at 6:00 PM, the Garrison Department executed the criminal Tang by firing squad and announced the charges. This is the first case of a reactionary criminal being executed after the Fujian Incident. The charges are recorded as follows: "Case investigation: On December 11 of last year, it was found that the 5th Regiment of the Central Military Police had sent a letter regarding the arrest of five reactionary criminals, Tang Nanqing, Xiong Meilin, Ma Shaofu, Zhao Fuchou, and Mi Fuqing, at No. 14 Yaobang Alley in Hankou, and the seal of the pseudo-commander-in-chief of the 4th Route Army of the pseudo-Chinese People's Revolutionary Army, commission certificates, orders, rosters, and other items seized, to the department. After being instructed to hand it over to the Military Law Office for separate review, it was confirmed that Tang Nanqing was a cadre of the pseudo-organization and harbored the pseudo-deputy commander Wang Hongjun, using the shared residence as a reactionary organ, and engaged in activities everywhere. Ma Shaofu and others were all introduced by him to join the organization. When the Fujian Incident occurred, Wuhan was filled with military police. Tang Nanqing dared to carry out reactionary activities and incite others to collude with traitors, which is unforgivable. In accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 1, of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, he should be sentenced to death. Ma Shaofu, Xiong Meilin, Zhao Fuchou, and Mi Fuqing are all guilty of inciting others to collude with traitors and should each be sentenced to twelve years in prison. The judgment has been drafted and submitted to Chairman Chiang's Nanchang Headquarters, Decree No. 230. In addition to Ma Shaofu and others who have been sentenced and sent to prison for execution, it is imperative to sign and bring Tang Nanqing, verify his identity, tie him to the execution ground for execution by firing squad, and announce it to all. This announcement is made by Tang Nanqing, 46 years old, from Hanyang County, Hubei." (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e111">Chairman Chiang Commends Song's Division for Recapturing Yanping <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>| Praising Its Glory as No Less Than the Huizhou Campaign |</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chairman Chiang believes that in the Battle of Yanping this time, in the Battle of Jiufeng, the rebels had deep trenches and strong fortifications, and were determined to block and defend, but Song's division did not wait for the assistance of the air force and artillery, and went straight down in one go. The rebel army surrendered in the wind. Yesterday, he specially issued a commendation order. The original order read: "This time in the Battle of Yanping, it was all thanks to the brave and life-risking service of our army's generals and soldiers, and the effective command of Commander Liu, who were able to pacify the rebel atmosphere in one fell swoop and recapture the famous city. At the beginning of the battle, it was believed that the rebel army's fortifications on Jiufeng Mountain were strong and difficult to attack. Therefore, only a part of Song's division was ordered to perform a supporting attack on Jiufeng Mountain. The air force and artillery fully assisted our main force in the bombing of the northeast of Yanping, originally hoping to capture Yanping first, and then attack Jiufeng Mountain. However, Song's division did not wait for the assistance of the air force and artillery, and immediately used a part to fight against its mortar and attack independently. After a day of fierce and hard fighting on Jiufeng Mountain, although officers and soldiers were killed and wounded repeatedly, they were not afraid at all, and they advanced one after another. Finally, at Weiriwei, they broke through the rebel's strong fortifications on Jiufeng Mountain, and its position was completely occupied by our Song's division. As a result, the rebel army was terrified. In addition, due to the fierce attack of our main force Liu's division in the northeast of Yanping, they occupied the Mingcui Pavilion fortress, and various important places in the northeast. The rebels left the city and surrendered. The glory of the Battle of Yanping this time, and the loyalty and bravery of our generals and soldiers, are no less than the recapture of Huizhou in the fourteenth year. It is indeed a manifestation of the revolutionary spirit. The independent and fearless spirit of Division Commander Song, and the loyalty and bravery of his subordinates, are especially commendable. I hereby issue a commendation order, and I hope that all the generals and soldiers of our army will be inspired, work hard to suppress the rebellion, bravely strive to be the first, and complete the great cause of the revolution, to comfort our President Sun and the spirits of the fallen soldiers in heaven. This order is issued by Chiang Chung-cheng."</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The National Army attacked Shuikou on the morning of the 7th, and after a day of fierce fighting, they finally completely recovered it in the afternoon. The headquarters has now received a report that a large number of the main rebel force were captured in this battle, and more than 1,300 rifles, 11 machine guns, 8 mortars, and countless ammunition were seized. The remnants fled to the south bank of Shuikou and were all intercepted and resolved by a certain unit of the National Army. (January 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e112">North Ning Railway Joint Transport Train Derailment <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Location: Between Fengtai and Changxindian</p>
<p>Cause: Old and Poorly Maintained Tracks</p>
<p>Two Cars Destroyed, Losses of 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Since the North Ning Railway started handling joint transport of goods, monthly revenue has increased sharply. Unexpectedly, at 2:50 AM on the 10th, a joint transport train derailed near kilometer marker 18 between Fengtai and Changxindian. The locomotive of the train was North Ning locomotive number 228, pulling 20 freight cars. A total of four freight cars were damaged. It is reported that when the locomotive reached a poor section of the track, the force of the wheels broke the rails. The first car did not leave the tracks, but nine cars, from the second to the tenth, derailed. Among them, the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh cars rolled down the embankment, which was about eight feet deep. Two freight cars were completely crushed, and the remaining two had partial damage. As for the tenth to twentieth freight cars, they were unharmed. After the accident, Zhang Pan, the deputy section chief of the North Ning Railway's locomotive department, urgently telegraphed the Fengtai car service and locomotive departments, as well as the locomotive department of the railway bureau, to report the derailment. The North Ning Railway immediately dispatched engineer Gu from the engineering department, section chief Li Xuxun from the locomotive department, and section chief Xiao Shufang from the car service department, along with deputy section chief Pan, to conduct a detailed investigation. After obtaining the results, they plan to prepare a report and submit it to the railway bureau. Traffic was restored at 1:20 AM on the 11th. According to staff from the joint transport department, the derailment was caused by the rails near kilometer marker 18 being too old and poorly maintained. These rails were manufactured by the Hanyang Arsenal in 1898 and are now over 30 years old. After investigation, it was proven that the rails were too weak, which led to the unfortunate derailment. The losses were significant, including 190 damaged railroad ties, 5 damaged rails, and severe damage to the cars. Total losses exceeded 20,000 yuan, and the delay in traffic was 24 hours, resulting in substantial business losses. Because most of the cars were freight cars, there were few deaths. The four cars that rolled down the embankment will be loaded later due to the time required for unloading. The other five cars were rerouted by the Ping Han locomotive department, and the roadbed and rails were repaired by the Ping Han Railway engineering department. (11th)</p>

<p>Following the closure of the Changfeng Qiaotai Xin Silk Factory in Huangnitou, several thousand yuan in wages are owed to workers, leading to repeated disputes. After mediation by the county government, factory manager Xu Junjie was ordered to pay all wages by today (the 13th). It is now learned that the factory also owes about 8,000 yuan for dried cocoons to cocoon suppliers, with Wan Yi Xie owing the most at 2,500 yuan, Shao Yongcheng owing 1,450 yuan, and the rest ranging from several hundred to several tens of yuan. The creditors have repeatedly and unsuccessfully pressed Xu Junjie for payment, so they have voluntarily formed a creditors' group and plan to petition the county government today and tomorrow, demanding that all debts of the Tai Xin Silk Factory be distributed equally to protect the livelihoods of farmers. Furthermore, following the closure of the Qingfeng Silk Factory outside the South Gate, many debts are owed. Manager Yao Juncheng is avoiding meetings. Since Yao also operates the Taifengyuan Tobacco Company in Changzhou, the Wuxi Silk Factory Guild has petitioned the Wujin County government to order Yao to return to Wuxi for settlement. Yesterday, Wujin County Magistrate Cai sent police to order Yao Juncheng to return to Wuxi for settlement and informed the Wuxi Silk Factory Guild.</p>

<p>After the Provincial Department of Education sent provincial supervisor Feng Ce and others to Cheng to conduct a special inspection for the reorganization of county education, the reorganization plan has been submitted to the department for approval. Currently, the following has been determined: The county-run normal school will be wound down this semester, and the existing class of students will be managed by the provincial Louxiashan Rural Normal School. All school equipment will be received by the Education Bureau. Schools in various districts will be consolidated due to the accumulation of unpaid educational expenses. For example, Shoushan Primary School in Yu District will be merged with the central primary school, and Tanxiang Primary School will be merged with Chengbei Primary School. Zhouzhuang North Street Primary School, Yanshan Primary School, Daizhuang Primary School, Qingtang Primary School, and Caizhuang Primary School, Xujing Primary school are all slated for closure. Other schools, such as Ma Zhen Guanshan Township Primary School, have also been closed in large numbers. Grades five and six of Qiaoqi Primary School and Yueqiao Primary School will be combined into one grade. Beiwai Juyong and Beidajie Primary Schools will be privatized. The middle street Louxia Elementary School will be transformed into a private school. Teacher salary standards will be divided into three levels, in accordance with Wuxi: Level 1, high school normal school graduates, monthly salary of 30 to 40 yuan; Level 2, high school graduates, monthly salary of 20 to 30 yuan; Level 3, county normal school graduates, monthly salary of 16 to 20 yuan. This will take effect on February 1. Education Bureau expenses will also be greatly reduced. County supervisor Chen Changyan is being removed. Provincial supervisors will come to Cheng within a few days to carry out the reorganization.</p>

<p>Xue Zhengling, a local resident, previously worked at the local Education Bureau and the Anti-Japanese Association. He was sentenced to imprisonment for embezzlement of public funds at the Anti-Japanese Association, along with accountant Dai Jie, and is currently appealing. Xue is now also accused of embezzlement of public funds at an agency in Yangzhou County and has been repeatedly summoned by the county but has failed to appear. The Yangzhou County government sent a letter to the local District Court requesting his arrest. Yesterday, the prosecutor's office ordered the police to arrest Xue Zhengling. After an initial interrogation in court, he was ordered to be detained pending a letter from the Yangzhou County government requesting his transfer for investigation.</p>

<p>Huang Zukang, the former county supervisor of this county, was reduced to the position of education official in the second district (Zhapu) after the head of the Education Bureau was changed. For the past two years, he has contributed to projects such as the construction of public squares. However, last month, he was suddenly accused by Liu Xugan and others from the local area (the son of a former judicial police officer of the county government) to the Education Bureau. Bureau chief Huang Qingrui has sent personnel to Zhapu several times to investigate, which has disheartened Huang. Unexpectedly, last night, someone used a large amount of ink to deface various signs in the public sports ground and completely painted over the words "founder Huang Zuliang" on the wooden signs, making Huang feel even more uneasy. He then resolutely resigned from the Education Bureau. It is reported that a replacement has already been internally decided and will be announced soon.</p>

<p>Xi Laosan, a 53-year-old man from Dongting Mountain, Jiangsu, who operates a cargo boat between Huzhou and Changxing, opened from Changxing to Huzhou a few days ago, and the boat stopped at the Beidou stone slab in this city. Yesterday at 8:00 AM, Xi Laosan checked the 500 silver dollars and 25 silver coins in the wooden bucket on the boat, and they were all still sealed and untouched. Xi then went ashore. When he returned to the boat in the afternoon and checked the silver, it had all vanished. He immediately questioned the crew, but they all denied knowing anything. Only the crew knew where Xi Laosan kept the money, and no one else had left the boat, so it was clear that the crew had stolen it. Xi then reported the situation to the county public security bureau's investigation team, and the team summoned crew members Han Jinrong, Zhao Shenggao, Zhou Liansheng, and Wu Chuangen for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Zhu Baoyuan's Widow Sues Two Sons for Division of Property <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Another Hearing Was Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Both Sides Hold to Their Own Views</p>
<p>After the death of Zhu Baoyuan, owner of Zhenhe Tea Shop, his widow Zhu Xixinbao sued Baoyuan's two sons, Zhu Yanqing and Zhu Shunqing, for failing to distribute 630,000 yuan of inheritance. She hired lawyer Chen Ying to file a lawsuit with the First Special District District Court for division of property. The two defendants also hired lawyer Zhang Zhengxue to defend them, arguing that Baoyuan's estate was only over 680,000 yuan, and after deducting 80,000 yuan for ancestral sacrifices, only a little over 600,000 yuan was available for distribution, with each person receiving 100,000 yuan. The District Court has repeatedly summoned all parties for questioning, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan held another hearing. According to the plaintiff Zhu Xixinbao, Baoyuan had a property ledger during his lifetime, which he wrote himself. The ledger was always placed on the table in the bedroom, and I saw it, but I do not know the specific items and amounts of property. Therefore, I request that an accountant be appointed to audit the accounts, and the distribution should be based on what is found in the future. After Baoyuan died, the bedroom was sealed. After more than ten days, the door was reopened, and all the furniture in the room was moved out. The two defendants then prepared new furniture for me, and the property ledger and other account books were packed and moved out by the defendants at that time, and so on. She also presented a bill, saying that this bill was given to me by Shunqing in Zhenhe Tea Shop, but the property listed in it does not seem to be complete. Defendant's lawyer Zhang Zhengxue immediately said that Baoyuan never had the so-called property ledger as claimed by the plaintiff. Although the plaintiff has repeatedly claimed that there is such a ledger and that the defendants took it away, she cannot prove it conclusively. The defendants only have a diary of their father, which details the types and amounts of property, as well as the business situation of Zhenhe and the contact information of relatives and friends. He then showed this diary to the plaintiff, asking if it was Baoyuan's belongings and if it was his handwriting. After the plaintiff looked at it, she said that the diary was indeed his belongings, and the larger characters written in the book were also Baoyuan's handwriting, but the smaller characters seemed difficult to identify and did not look like his writing. Lawyer Zhang then stated to the court that the plaintiff was making insincere statements. This diary was written by Baoyuan himself, but she said it did not look like his handwriting. The plaintiff must have many handwritten notes by Baoyuan in her collection. Please order her to produce them for verification, which should clarify the matter. The plaintiff then said that I have no scraps of paper or words from Baoyuan's hand, as they were completely taken away when the furniture was moved. The plaintiff's lawyer then requested: 1) to obtain Baoyuan's handwritten property ledger; 2) the full Zhenhe business accounts for the past five years; 3) to summon additional witnesses. Lawyer Zhang then said that in addition to the handwritten diary of Baoyuan that has now been submitted, there is no so-called property ledger. Furthermore, the plaintiff's lawsuit is for division of property, not for auditing accounts. Zhenhe's business and Baoyuan's estate are two completely separate matters and cannot be discussed together. However, in order to dispel the plaintiff's suspicions, the defendants have voluntarily sent Zhenhe's account books to an accountant for verification. Now that the court wants to review them, it should notify the parties concerned to comply. Judge Qiao then questioned the witnesses who were present about the financial dealings they had with Zhu Baoyuan, and then adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Yin Xianfu Convicted of Embezzling Funds from Kangyuan Factory <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>After the Detective Office Appealed to the Supreme Court</p>
<p>The Case Was Returned for Retrial and He Was Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Xiang Kangyuan, the owner of Kangyuan Printing and Can Manufacturing Factory, in the spring of 1930, commissioned Yin Xianfu, a native of Suzhou, to handle the registration of the factory's branch in Singapore and remitted 1,500 yuan from the Shanghai headquarters to cover all expenses. However, Yin secretly pocketed the money and falsely claimed that the money had been given to a local lawyer and agent Zheng Tianfu to entrust to lawyer Xue Feike Dansi for handling. He also forged Xue's English receipt and sent it back to the headquarters to cover up the matter. Later, he used the excuse of fostering relationships with Singaporean gentry and businessmen to promote business and embezzled 300 yuan from the factory, reporting that it was a commission paid to Hu Wentao's nephew Hu Guigeng for promoting products. However, Xiang Kangyuan later discovered that everything was fabricated. After Yin returned to Shanghai, Xiang reported the matter to the Detective Office, which sent detectives to arrest Yin. After completing the investigation, they filed a lawsuit with the First Special District District Court for embezzlement. The initial trial resulted in a verdict of not guilty, as the defendant was found to have no embezzling act. The Detective Office, believing that the evidence was sufficient, appealed the original verdict to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. However, the second instance still resulted in a verdict of not guilty. The Detective Office then filed a third appeal with the Supreme Court. Lawyer Ru Baoyi pointed out the improprieties of the initial two trials and presented his reasons for disagreeing with the verdicts. The petition was very lengthy. After reviewing the entire record, the Supreme Court found that the original verdict was too lenient and that the acquittal was insufficient to convince. The Supreme Court vacated the original verdict and remanded the case to the Second Branch of the High Court for retrial. The High Court then sent all written evidence, such as the lawyer's receipt and related correspondence, to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for authentication. The institute's report proved that the receipts and letters were forged. It also sent a letter to the Chinese Consulate in Singapore to inquire whether there was a lawyer named Xue in Singapore and whether Zheng Tianfu existed, which Yin could not confirm. Hu Guigeng was also summoned to court, and Hu solemnly stated that he had never received any commission. The letter he sent to Yin Xianfu originally contained the words "蒙賜數物 (received several items)," but Yin presented a photograph of the letter with the words changed to "蒙賜三數 (received three numbers)." If he had presented the original letter, the flaws would have been easily exposed. The presiding judge of the criminal court, Yu Hua, and judges Zhao Zhengzhang and Lin Wopeng, having concluded their investigation of all evidence and witnesses, were clear about the situation. They then scheduled an oral argument. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the Detective Office argued that the case had been investigated several times, and this investigation was particularly detailed. The defendant's forgery of receipts and alteration of letters had been strongly proven. Therefore, it would be difficult for him to escape responsibility for the crime of continuous embezzlement of property in the course of business. He requested that the previous improper verdicts be overturned and that the defendant be punished according to the law. Yin also hired lawyers Zhang Feixiong and Zhang Shibeng to defend him. The verdict has now been announced. The main text is that the original verdict is vacated, and Yin Xianfu is sentenced to six months imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of items held in the course of business. The number of days of detention before the verdict is determined will be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days.</p>

<p>From Pukou to Wusong</p>
<p>Totaling 4,300 Tons</p>
<p>The Two Railway Bureau, due to the urgent need for coal at the Wusong Coal Depot, previously hired the Daxing steamer from the Meishun Steamship Company last month to transport a batch of Zhongxing coal from Pukou, which has already been unloaded. As the coal in the depot still needs to be replenished and the bureau's vehicles are insufficient, they have hired the Huashun steamer from the same steamship company to transport Zhongxing coal, totaling approximately 4,300 tons. The loading began around the 11th of this month in Pukou, and it is being transported to Song. The transportation fee is still handled according to the previous arrangement with the Daxing steamer, which is estimated to save about five jiao per ton compared to the previous price charged by the Zhongxing Company.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Recent Property and Land Taxes Implemented by the French Concession <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Council recently reported the land tax, property tax, and other taxes to be implemented starting in 1934, as follows: 1) Land Tax: For all properties located within the French Concession, in addition to the provisions of Article 6 of the agreement of April 8, 1914, all tax rates should be levied at 80% of 1% of the land value. This land tax should be paid every six months. 2) Property Tax: "Type 1" The tax rate for Type 1 is set at 13% of the total rent, payable quarterly by the tenant. The resolution of this board of directors on December 30, 1930, regarding the method of collecting taxes on leased houses, should still be implemented in 1934. Regarding property tax for owner-occupied houses, the rental value of the house should be estimated according to the following method, and 13% of the value should be taxed: "Section 1" The rental value from the French Bund to the east of Min Ti Ni Yin Road, extending to Lan Wei Ai Road, is estimated as follows: Houses and vacant land should be calculated at 5% of the total estimated value of the property. "Section 2" The rental value from the west of Min Ti Ni Yin Road and Lan Wei Ai Road to the east of Lu Ban Road, extending to Bai Liang Bu Road, is estimated as follows: Houses should be calculated at 6% of the total estimated value of the property. Vacant land: 1) Under three mu, should be calculated at 6% of the total estimated value of the property; 2) Three mu to six mu, calculated at 4%; 3) Six mu to nine mu, calculated at 2%; 4) Over nine mu, calculated at 1%. "Section 3" The rental value from the west of Lu Ban Road and Bai Er Bu Road to the east of Ya Er Bei Road is estimated as follows: Houses should be calculated at 7% of the total estimated value of the property. Vacant land: 1) Under three mu, should be calculated at 7% of the total estimated value of the property; 2) Three mu to six mu, calculated at 4%; 3) Six mu to nine mu, calculated at 2%; 4) Over nine mu, calculated at 1%. "Section 4" The rental value in the 1914 extension of Ya Er Bei Road to the west is estimated as follows: Houses should be calculated at 8% of the total estimated value of the property. Vacant land: 1) Under three mu, should be calculated at 8% of the total estimated value of the property; 2) Three mu to six mu, calculated at 4%; 3) Six mu to nine mu, calculated at 2%; 4) Over nine mu, calculated at 1%. The above-mentioned method of reducing the estimated rental value cannot be applied to the property tax on houses and vacant land used for commercial or industrial purposes. Regarding the property tax on sublet buildings, it should be calculated proportionally based on the benefit enjoyed by the tenant and the total rent, as follows: 1) Sublet buildings with heating equipment should be calculated at 90% of their rental value; 2) Sublet buildings with heating and running water equipment should be calculated at 85% of their rental value; 3) Sublet buildings with heating and lighting equipment should be calculated at 85% of their rental value; 4) Sublet buildings with heating, lighting, and running water equipment should be calculated at 80% of their rental value. In addition to heating, lighting, and running water equipment, sublet buildings with other comfortable facilities, such as elevators, air conditioning, swimming pools, private parlors, indoor tennis courts, and garbage incinerators, should be calculated at 70% of their rental value. However, the amount of property tax on sublet buildings may be agreed upon by special agreement based on the rental value of the house. This basis should be revised every two years. Property Tax "Type 2" The tax rate for Type 2 is set at 13% of the total rent, payable every two months by the tenant. The above-mentioned provisions regarding the method of collecting taxes on leased houses, owner-occupied houses, and sublet buildings are applicable to this Type 2 property tax. The method of collecting taxes on leased houses by this board of directors on December 30, 1930, should still be implemented in 1934.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, a fashionable modern woman lay down on the Shanghai-Woosung Railway tracks in front of the Law School on Jiangwan Road, Zhabei, and committed suicide. Yesterday morning, Wang Jinfu, a local security officer from the Jiuyi map area, reported the incident to the District Court for verification. The court dispatched Inspector Ouyang to the scene to examine the body. The deceased was wearing an empty green woolen coat, a black wool camel hair cheongsam, a wrinkled silk short shirt and pants, high-heeled leather shoes, and flesh-colored stockings. She had been run over at the waist, and her right hand was also severed. As there were no family members present at the time, a charitable organization collected the body, awaiting investigation and notification of the family for claiming it. The official interrogated the local security officer that evening, who stated that after the incident, the investigating police and train driver stated that the deceased arrived in a car at 3:00 PM on the 11th of this month, asking for the railway to Jiangwan. At 3:09 PM, the Woosung train arrived from Shanghai, and the woman immediately laid down, resulting in her being crushed to death. The railway police found five yuan in banknotes, three yuan in silver dollars, and six jiao in small coins near the deceased's body, all of which are at the police station. The official instructed to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Zixin, the General Manager of the Shanghai South Temporary Shelter, submitted a document yesterday to Mr. Wang Yiting and Mr. Huang Hanzhi, the two chairmen of the Shanghai Charity Organization Federation, stating: "Respectfully submitted, since the establishment of our shelter on the 24th of last month, we have set up three branch shelters. As of yesterday, we have registered and sheltered a total of 2,179 civilians. Among them, 297 people have voluntarily left the shelter or have been claimed by their families, 39 people have been sent to the hospital for treatment, and 12 people have died. Currently, there are 633 people living in the first shelter at the South Railway Station, the Huzhou Guildhall, 824 people living in the second shelter at the Huhui Villa on Xietu Road, and 374 people living in the third shelter at the Great King Temple on Great King Temple Street. The three shelters have a total of 1,831 residents. We need more than thirteen dan of rice per day, averaging seven he of rice per person. However, the shelter is severely lacking in cotton clothing. Recently, the weather has turned cold suddenly, and the civilians are suffering from hunger and cold. They are flocking to the shelter in droves, which is pitiful. Therefore, we respectfully submit this request, hoping that your association will negotiate with various charitable organizations regarding the cotton clothing. Please raise as much as possible and allocate as much as possible, so that the civilians in the shelter will not suffer from lack of clothing. As for the operating expenses, we will strive to be thrifty in order to live up to your kindness. We also ask your association to send personnel to visit the shelters at any time to inspect and provide guidance. We are deeply grateful." It is also heard that Mr. Sun Yishan of the Shanghai South Charity Association is sparing no effort in raising funds for the relief of civilians. Yesterday, he raised 100 silver dollars from Mr. Zhang Xuji, a philanthropist, who donated the funds intended for his parents' 60th birthday banquet to the association for the needs of the sheltered civilians. The Xinwei Relief Association also donated 100 sets of new cotton clothing.</p>

<p>Gu Longsheng, a local resident, works for a customs brokerage firm. He and his wife, Zhang, 27 years old, live at No. 21 Taiting Lane, Laoximen. The couple's relationship has always been very good. Recently, Gu Longsheng has become involved with someone else and does not come home often, leading to frequent quarrels.

<p>Yao Lizheng vehemently denied it and narrowly escaped</p>
<p>Ultimately unable to escape the law, he was sentenced to more than a year in prison</p>
<p>Yao Lizheng, 28 years old from Zhenjiang, used to work at a rubber factory in Shanghai but was dismissed for misconduct and became unemployed. He temporarily resided at the Yikang Money Shop on Avenue Edward VII, No. 68, managed by Huang Zibin, a fellow townsman. Every night, Yao slept in the main hall. Yao saw that the vault in the main hall contained a large number of banknotes and had malicious intentions. However, because an apprentice slept in the vault every night as a guard, he could not get started. In December of last year, after everyone had gone to bed, he pretended to be a ghost howling and used other supernatural powers to scare away the apprentice. The young apprentice was timid and was indeed frightened away. He swapped beds with Yao, allowing Yao to calmly open the vault and steal 7,600 yuan in cash, which he sent to his mistress Yu Xiuying at No. 538 Yongxing Road, Zhabei. After the shop discovered this, they reported it to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. Yao vehemently denied it. The detective suspected foul play but had no choice but to conduct a secret investigation. However, Yao was the prime suspect, so they sent someone to secretly follow and investigate him. Yao, thinking he had narrowly escaped, spent a lot of money, buying coats, fur coats, and cameras, and paying off debts. He also took his mistress to Suzhou for a trip. The detective found out and arrested Yao. After interrogation, he confessed and led them to recover 6,200 yuan in stolen money from his mistress's house. Both Yao Lizheng and his mistress Yu Xiuying were arrested and handed over to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. The trial has concluded, and yesterday Sun Pengxian, a judge of the Eighth Criminal Court, sentenced Yao Lizheng to one year and six months in prison for theft, and Yu Xiuying to two months in prison for receiving stolen goods. The stolen goods were returned to the owner.</p>

<p>Once is already too much, how can it happen again?</p>
<p>Continuous Fraud Resulted in a Six-Month Sentence</p>
<p>Wang Zhendong from Guangdong used to be in the tin mining business in Nanyang and accumulated considerable wealth. His son, Wang Fupeng, studied at Zhijiang University in Hangzhou. However, there was a fellow townsman named Zhang Youwu, 27 years old, who claimed to have served in the Volunteer Army outside the customs. After retiring, he became destitute in Shanghai, staying in a cheap hotel and unable to find work, which led to financial difficulties. In December of last year, he used Wang Fupeng's name to send a telegram to Wang Zhendong in Nanyang, saying that he was ill and stranded in Room 102 of the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road, Shanghai. He had no money for medicine and urgently requested that several hundred yuan be remitted to Shanghai to relieve his immediate need. After receiving the telegram, Wang Zhendong believed it to be true and immediately remitted 250 yuan. Zhang obtained the large sum of money and squandered it at will. In just a few days, his pockets were empty again. However, he recalled that the previous method could still be used. On the 10th of this month, he sent another telegram to Wang Zhendong, saying that the previous sum had been received, but his illness was severe and he had not recovered. The money was gone, and he requested that another 300 yuan be remitted to Room 318 of the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. After receiving this telegram, Wang Zhendong became suspicious. His son was studying in Hangzhou, how could he suddenly fall ill in Shanghai? He also sent a telegram to his nephew Wang Bo, asking him to investigate nearby. Wang Bo was studying at the Dongwu Law School on Kunshan Road. After receiving his uncle's telegram, he knew that Wang Fuyue was studying at Zhijiang University in Hangzhou and was in good health. He had just received a letter from him a few days ago, so how could he suddenly be sick in Shanghai? Something was clearly wrong. He remained calm and went to the Asia Hotel yesterday morning to investigate. He saw the name Wang Fu written in the registration book for Room 318 and saw that the room door was closed. He went to the French Concession Police Station to report. The head detective said that the incident occurred in the Public Concession and instructed him to report to the English Concession. Wang Bo then went to the Lao Zha Police Station and stated the previous situation. Detective Xie Guisheng went to Room 318 of the Asia Hotel and arrested Zhang Shiwu, confiscating two telegram receipts. He was taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, detailed the above situation, saying that the police were prosecuting him for fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code and requested that he be punished according to law. Wang Bo also submitted a statement of the investigation. When questioned, the defendant Zhang Shiwu confessed to the charges and asked for leniency.

<p>To Avoid the Stigma of "Sick Man of East Asia," Everyone Must Ascend to Longevity City</p>
<p>The Entire Nation Must Participate in Tuberculosis Prevention</p>
<p>The China Anti-Tuberculosis Association hosted the local press at the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao at 4:00 PM yesterday and screened a tuberculosis prevention film. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Reception for the Press <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Those present included Li Ting'an, Director of the Health Bureau, Li Dachao, Section Chief of the Municipal Government, Yan Fuqing, Executive Director of the Association, Zhang Junjun, General Secretary, and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers. Chairman Yan Fuqing gave a speech, saying, "Since the establishment of our association, we have received much support and guidance from all walks of life, which is why we have achieved today's results. We are very grateful. Now, in order to expand tuberculosis prevention propaganda, we have specially prepared refreshments and invite you all to come here to hold a joint meeting with the press and screen a tuberculosis prevention film to add to the fun. We are honored by your presence."</p>
<h3 id="e143">Speech and Notes <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Next, Li Ting'an gave a speech, saying, "According to the world's statistics per 10,000 people, New Zealand has 50 deaths, Egypt has 72.02 deaths, Spain has 136 deaths, Italy has 148 deaths, France has 175 deaths, and Japan has 186 deaths. However, the tuberculosis death rate in our country is as high as 307 people. This is six times the death rate of New Zealand, four times that of Egypt and the United States, three and a half times that of Germany, three times that of the United Kingdom, two and a half times that of Spain, and one and a half times that of France and Japan." "Oh, the vast Chinese tuberculosis army! However, the index of 307 people is based on the 1929 survey of the First Health District of Beiping. However, this number should not be regarded as the tuberculosis death rate in China, because the climate of Beiping is the most suitable climate in the country for health. With the superior climate of Beiping, there are still 307 people out of every 100,000 who are captured by the tuberculosis army. Then, the increase in the number of people whose climate south of the Yangtze River is not suitable for the health of the nation should not be surprising. If we do not seek to cope with it as soon as possible, then the consequences will be unimaginable. The methods are: (1) implement remedial treatment for those who are already ill; (2) implement tuberculosis prevention for those who are not yet ill." Li Dachao then gave a speech, saying, "Tuberculosis prevention methods: (1) passive treatment; (2) active prevention, which can remedy the situation and avoid its spread." Zhang Junjun and Zhu Hengbi also gave speeches, but their speeches were too long to be recorded. After the speeches, a tea party was held, followed by the screening of a tuberculosis prevention film. The event ended at 6:00 PM. At the same time, the association distributed a copy of the Pulmonary Disease Guide, Pulmonary Disease Treatment Method, Pulmonary Disease Prevention Method, and the association's charter to the guests present.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Ministry of Communications Prohibits Three Seagoing Vessels from Sailing <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Shun Yuan, Yu Da, and Yu Tong Three Ships</p>
<p>All Foreign Crew Members Have No Ministry Certification</p>
<p>Ministry Order Arrived in Shanghai After Ships Had Already Sailed</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has expressly ordered that shipowners of Chinese merchant ships who employ foreign crew members who have not undergone inspection or applied for a supplementary examination and certificate renewal are not allowed to continue employing them. Violators will have their ships seized and prohibited from sailing. This time, the Yu Da Company's Yu Da and Yu Tong, and the Yongyuan Company's Shun Yuan have shipmasters, chief mates, and chief engineers who are all foreign nationals, who have not been inspected by the Ministry of Communications and have deliberately violated the ministry's orders by not applying for a supplementary examination and certificate renewal, and are still working on the ships. This time, the three ships sailed from North China to Shanghai at the same time. After arriving in Shanghai, the issue of crew qualifications arose.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Yantai Maritime Bureau Obstructs <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>When the three ships came to Shanghai, they knew that none of the senior crew members were qualified for inspection, and according to regulations, they could not pass through Shanghai. When the ships sailed from Yantai, they requested the Yantai Maritime Bureau to send a telegram to Shanghai to lobby the Shanghai Maritime Bureau, requesting that the three ships be allowed to sail as usual. The Shanghai Maritime Bureau received the telegram and allowed Shun Yuan, Yu Da, and Yu Tong to pass through.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Master Mariners' Association Sends Telegram to the Ministry <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>After the Shun Yuan and other three ships entered the port, the Shanghai Merchant Mariners' Association learned that all the crew members were foreigners, none of them had certificates, and none of them had been inspected by the Ministry of Communications. This violated Article 16 of the Ministry's regulations for crew members, which stipulates that foreign crew members should not be allowed to work on Chinese ships. The association, based on the request of its members, sent an urgent telegram to the Ministry of Communications on the 9th of this month, requesting the Ministry to implement the suspension of the foreign crew members of the Shun Yuan, Yu Da, and Yu Tong, and to replace them with certified crew members who have passed the inspection, and to order the Shanghai Maritime Bureau to prohibit the ships from clearing customs and sailing.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Ministry Order Prohibits Sailing of Three Ships <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Master Mariners' Association feared that there would be a delay, so it sent an urgent telegram to the Ministry of Communications. At the same time, it submitted a copy of the telegram to the local Maritime Bureau, requesting that the three ships not be allowed to clear customs and sail. However, the day after the telegram was sent, there was no reply from the Ministry. It was not until the 11th that the Ministry's approval was received, stating that the request to ban the foreign crew members of the Shun Yuan, Yu Da, and Yu Tong from being inspected and to prohibit them from clearing customs should be followed. The order had been sent to the Maritime Bureau for compliance. Unfortunately, the Ministry's order prohibiting sailing arrived in Shanghai after the three ships had already cleared customs and left Shanghai a day earlier. Although they narrowly escaped this time, they may not be able to sail to Shanghai next time unless they replace the crew members with certified crew members.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Opinions of the Two Egg Industry Associations on Coping with Increased Taxes in Various Countries <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday a letter was sent to the Trade Bureau to be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Protesting to Various Countries to Reduce Import Tax Rates</p>
<p>Our country's egg exports have always occupied an important position. Taking exports to France as an example, it requires 20,000 to 30,000 dan per year. Last winter, the country restricted the quantity of our exports to more than 9,000 dan per year, which is a significant difference from the previous export volume. Then, it increased the import license tax on ice-cured eggs to 4.60 francs per net kilogram (French currency), which is almost a 100% tax rate, more than twice the tax on fresh eggs. Therefore, it has a huge impact on our country's egg exports. The local International Trade Bureau previously received an order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and held discussions with egg merchants on December 29 last year to discuss remedial measures. Now, the bureau has received opinions from the Shanghai Egg Industry Association and the Ice Egg Industry Association, requesting that they be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval. The original text is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e149">Ice Egg Industry Association <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Ice Egg Industry Association sent a letter to the International Trade Bureau yesterday, stating, "We are writing to you because we have received a notice from your bureau that the French government intends to reserve three-quarters of all licenses for ice egg imports and exchange them conditionally at any time. This matter has a great impact on our country's ice egg exports to France. We held a meeting of ice egg exporters in this city on December 29 last year to discuss the situation, which has been recorded by your bureau. Since 1932, the French government has not only increased the original tax from 2% to 4%, but also added an import license tax of 400 francs per 100 kilograms last year, which is equivalent to about 50% of the ad valorem tax. Since the tax was levied, our ice egg exports to France have suffered a great blow. Now, it is intensifying the situation by restricting the issuance of licenses, which is close to monopolizing commerce and resisting the import of our country's native products. This is not appropriate in terms of commercial ethics. This is the first point. Moreover, ice eggs are food and cannot be compared to luxury goods. The French increase in the license tax is similar to a luxury tax. Now, it has increased the tax and added restrictions, and the restrictions are extremely harsh. Most of the French goods imported into our country are luxury goods and consumables. Our customs not only do not impose harsh taxes, but also do not impose restrictions. In terms of the principle of reciprocity in trade, the French government should not do this. This is the second point. Please check whether the French goods imported into China are more or less than our goods exported. If more French goods are imported into China, then our country is promoting so many luxury goods for France, and France should provide convenience for our country's egg imports. Now, it is not considering this, but restricting our ice egg imports. In terms of friendship, it is not appropriate to do this. This is the third point. According to our association's humble opinion, the countermeasures are divided into the following three steps: (1) Please ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to the French government based on the above reasons and cancel the original proposal to retain three-quarters of the ice egg licenses, and return all ice egg import licenses to our country as usual. (2) If the protest is invalid, please ask the Ministry of Finance to handle French goods imported into our country in the same way as the country taxes our ice eggs, that is, increase the import tax rate and issue a license tax, and give one-quarter of the license to other countries that treat us equally. (3) If, after investigation, it is found that fewer French goods are imported into China than our goods are exported to France, then we should persuade them to realize the situation out of friendship. The relationship between China and France has always been strong, and commercial cooperation should be on the path of mutual prosperity. We should not have narrow views, restrict our imports, and lose our goodwill. Please ask the French government to return the three-quarters of the ice egg import license tax that has been retained to our country as usual. We have contributed these humble opinions, and we hope that your bureau will participate in the discussion and forward them to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for prompt review and handling. We are truly grateful for your assistance."</p>
<h3 id="e150">Fresh Egg Industry Association <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Fresh Egg Industry Association sent a letter to the Trade Bureau, stating, "We are writing to you because we have recently found that various countries have repeatedly increased tariffs on our egg imports, especially Japan, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, and the Philippines. This has led to a decrease in our country's egg exports. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt, the export of local goods is a matter of life and death for rural areas. This must be remedied. We have considered that all countries in the East and West have surplus agricultural and industrial products, and our country is the final destination for sales. Our country's money exports must be tens of thousands of yuan. It can be seen that our assistance to the farmers and workers of various countries is not weak, and the benefits that various countries have received from us are not small. While we are doing our best to promote their surplus goods, they are restricting our imports, which violates the principle of trade and loses the balance of affairs. In May of last year, we submitted a report to Minister Song, proposing this opinion at the London Economic Conference, requesting a reduction in the import tax rate on eggs. Unexpectedly, the discussion was fruitless and became a pending case. However, our country's egg industry has been forced into a critical autumn. If we do not remedy it, we will follow the path of silk and tea and perish together. The impact on rural areas is huge. Therefore, we earnestly request that your bureau discuss a complete plan and effectively remedy the egg industry. We are extremely grateful. We offer two opinions: (1) We should ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest separately to various countries, requesting a reduction in the import tax rate on eggs. If this is ineffective, we should ask the Ministry of Finance to increase the import tax on imported goods from those countries in retaliation. (2) We should ask the Ministry of Finance to follow the common practice of various countries and exempt export egg taxes. All countries' increase in egg taxes and the resistance methods that our country should adopt are attached in detail for reference. We are extremely grateful for your assistance."</p>

<h3 id="e156">Shanghai and Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureaus Held Tea Improvement Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>This Year's Export Standards Have Been Decided</p>
<p>Improvement Field Will Hold a Meeting Today to Discuss Implementation</p>
<p>Regarding the inspection of Chinese tea exports, strict standards are set every year to improve quality, increase international trade, prevent adulteration, and maintain overseas reputation. The implementation has been very effective. This year, the Shanghai and Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureaus are paying more attention to promoting quality. In order to crack down on colored tea and strictly limit moisture and ash content, it is necessary to revise the standards. Therefore, yesterday at 1 p.m., the 23rd Annual Standard Tea Revision Meeting was held in the Tea Inspection Room of the bureau. Attendees included Ye Yuanding, Fang Hanzhou, Wu Juenong, Hu Haochuan, and Zhou Zhenjun. Ye Yuanding was the chairman, Hu Haochuan was the recorder, and the formalities were observed. (A) Chairman's Report (omitted). (B) Matters for discussion: ㈠ How to revise the tea standard? Resolved: The red tea standard was passed according to the sample proposed by the Hankou Bureau. The green tea standard followed the 22nd annual standard. ㈡ How to revise the tea moisture content? Resolved: The moisture content of red and green tea should be 8.5%. However, this year, in addition to the standard for green tea, the moisture content of red tea should be 10.5% to pass, and the moisture content of other teas should be 12% to pass. ㈢ How to revise the tea ash content? Resolved: The maximum ash content of red and green tea should be 7%. ㈣ How to revise the color of colored tea? Resolved: Passed according to the sample proposed by the Shanghai Bureau. ㈤ How to decide on measures to crack down on colored tea? Resolved: ㈠ Merchants who declare colored tea for inspection must fill in the names of the coloring materials in detail. If necessary, they must submit all the coloring materials for inspection. ㈡ Tea that is excessively colored and the same or heavier than the established colored tea standard is prohibited from export. ㈢ The use of toxic coloring materials containing metals such as lead, copper, antimony, chromium, barium, and cadmium (such as the commonly used light yellow "Three Fish Yellow," "Yi Ji Huang," and "Sand Green") and other inorganic or organic substances is prohibited from export. ㈥ How to implement the motions of this session? Resolved: The two bureaus will submit them to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval and promulgation in accordance with regulations. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the Tea Improvement Field, jointly operated by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute and the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, will hold the third Tea Improvement Field Committee meeting at 9 a.m. today at the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute to discuss important matters such as the selection of a successor to the late Director Yu Qian and the plan to reorganize the field's affairs. After receiving the notice, Wu Juenong, a technician from the Agricultural Inspection Group of the bureau, departed last night to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e157">City Federation Cables Ministry of Finance to Correct the Stamp Tax Bureau's Excessive Fines <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizen's Federation, believing that the Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau deliberately imposes excessive fines, disturbing merchants and harming the people, requested the Ministry of Finance to correct it. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to Kong, Minister of the Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Nanjing, stating: "According to a letter from the 27th Branch of the Federation, a member of the association, Quan Xingkang, reported that on the afternoon of the 18th of this month, at 2 p.m., personnel from the Stamp Office went to the shop to inspect the stamps. At that time, they took away twelve books and two folders. However, all the account books of the shop have always been stamped without omission. But the books, etc., taken away were old and defective, some with the covers separated, and some with the stamps missing, not intentionally evading the tax. Now, we specially send a letter to your association, asking you to uphold justice, consider the difficulties of merchants, and negotiate with the Stamp Office to return the books, etc., taken away in full." In view of this, the member has always attached great importance to government tax revenue, and all books that should be affixed with stamp tax have never been evaded. The twelve account books taken away this time are indeed old and defective, and the old stamps inevitably fall off after a long time. We specifically request that you consider the difficulties of merchants and approve a letter to the Special District Stamp Tax Bureau, ordering the immediate return of the account books taken away." The Shanghai Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Trade Association also sent a letter stating, "Recently, the Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau has been very serious about inspecting the stamp affixing of various shops. Even slight errors are punished, which is very harmful to merchants. Those who deliberately fail to affix stamps or affix an insufficient amount of stamps deserve to be punished. However, there are also those who clearly comply with the regulations and affix stamps in accordance with the law, but are fined for no reason due to the inspectors' desire for credit or negligence. Once executed, it is impossible to recover. For example, a receipt of 88 jiao from our member, Dehua Biscuit Company, was affixed with a stamp of 1 fen, but was fined 5 yuan by the Stamp Tax Law Violation Review Committee. After our association went to plead the case, they claimed that it had already been executed and could not be revoked. In addition, a payment notice from Taichang Food Company, in accordance with commercial practice, is merely a simple notice and has no monetary payment relationship. After our association pleaded repeatedly to no avail, it was eventually fined 20 yuan. In view of this, there is no room for redress for those who are wrongly fined. Those who should not be fined are judged according to the mood of the bureau, doing whatever they want, which is difficult to justify. If this trend continues, even loans of friendship or inquiry notes must be affixed with stamps. Lawyers' letters for collecting debts are not seen to be affixed with stamps. Merchants are adding unexpected burdens, which is both funny and sad. In addition to sending a letter to the Review Committee to pay attention, it is generally believed that this type of event is a common problem for the entire business community. All merchants should express their opinions. Therefore, we specifically send a letter to various trade associations, asking for their support and cooperation in resisting this. We also send a letter to your association, hoping that you will propose a discussion to jointly seek a solution to alleviate the suffering. We are very grateful for your assistance. We have learned that the Stamp Tax Inspection Office uses concession police force to arbitrarily oppress Chinese merchants, while condoning foreign merchants who do not affix stamps, which is harmful to the country and the people. We specifically request that you promptly revoke this and correct the various excessive fines of the Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau. The country will be fortunate, and the merchants will be fortunate. Shanghai First Special District Citizen's Federation." Sincerely, printed.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses the Issue of Recruiting Business Corps Members <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Business Corps Member Recruitment Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, with the consent of the Chairman of the Council, invited representatives of the British and American Chambers of Commerce to the Business Corps gymnasium on the upper floor of the Municipal Council at noon on the 12th to discuss the issue of increasing the number of corps members, with particular emphasis on British and American members. Those present included the British and American Consuls General, the Presidents of the British and American Chambers of Commerce, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, the members of the committee, the Commander of the Business Corps, and the Director-General of the Municipal Council. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Arnold, Chairman of the Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Municipal Council. After the meeting began, the Chairman delivered a speech, stating in essence that according to the report of the Commander of the Business Corps, there are currently more than 800 vacancies in the corps, especially the lack of British and American members, which is a matter of regret. Because Shanghai is in a special position, there have been dangers in the past, and it is necessary to rely on self-defense. Although the foreign troops stationed in Shanghai have historically assisted the Business Corps and the police of this sector in protecting life and property, in view of the recent withdrawal of a battalion of British troops, in the event of an emergency, the existing foreign troops are not sufficient for the first line of defense. The Business Corps must take on the work of the first line, so it must have a sufficient number of people who are properly trained to cope with the situation. In the past, the mobilization of the Business Corps sometimes took too long, which caused inconvenience to businesses due to the lack of personnel. This difficulty has now been planned to be resolved. It is hoped that the leaders of various firms will encourage their young employees to serve, and not think that safety can be expected because there are a few stationed troops. Regarding this matter, it is hoped that various businesses will express their opinions as much as possible. Then, the American Consul General spoke, endorsing the chairman's proposal, hoping that everyone would do their duty. The British Consul General also expressed his full support for this initiative, saying that the British have always been confident and self-reliant, and those who have gone overseas to make a living have always had an active spirit of self-defense. It is the same in Shanghai today, and it is hoped that various businesses will provide their employees with convenience, so that qualified young people will be happy to fulfill their duties. Then, the Commander of the Business Corps stated that he felt the lack of personnel during the last mobilization, and those who joined temporarily were not easy to incorporate, so they must enlist in advance. As for the corps members, there are active duty members and Grade A and B reserve members. Active duty members must go to training at least twelve times a year, excluding inspections and shooting practice. Grade A members go to training six fewer times, and Grade B members are those who have served in the military. After speaking, the celebrities present discussed it, and it was hoped that the main employees in the firms could be exempted from service unless in extremely urgent situations. The chairman then explained that if there are sufficient corps members, those who have difficulty leaving their posts can be exempted from work.</p>

<p>Mr. Dong Kunfan, the Fujian exhibitor at the Chicago Exposition, returned to Shanghai yesterday from the United States. According to him, more than 30 national pavilions participated in the Chicago Expo, but only a dozen or so won special awards. However, the lacquerware exhibited by the Fujian Huier Orphanage was among them. Chicago newspapers also published and promoted the history of lacquerware celebrities. Chinese lacquerware was originally a famous product, but due to the lack of organization in foreign trade and the inappropriateness of internal manufacturing, it has declined in recent years. Since this exhibition, the United States has regained its faith in it. Tea umbrellas, bronzes, and other items are also welcomed by them. The Huier Orphanage is originally a charitable organization, which is not easy to maintain. With this honor, it is believed that all sectors will provide more support.</p>

<p>Southeast Societies Organize a Team</p>
<p>General Society Relief Team to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society believes that it is necessary to provide relief to refugees and wounded soldiers in the war zones of Zhejiang and Fujian due to the recent conflicts. The Shanghai Office of the Southeast Main Society has selected team members from the Shanghai, Ningbo, Zhenjiang, Bengbu, and Xuzhou societies to form the first joint relief team, totaling twelve team members, one medical director, two medical assistants, and more than ten laborers. Chen Chaji was publicly elected as the team leader, and Zhao Yulin as the deputy team leader. All departure procedures have been prepared, and personnel have been sent to negotiate with the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The provincial government has sent a letter to the Security Director and the military authorities for review. Once a reply is received, the team will depart for the front lines to implement relief. At the same time, it is also heard that the China General Society of the society is also organizing a relief team to go south to cooperate with the Southeast Relief Team in providing relief. A telegram was received yesterday reporting that the general team leader, Nie Chenglin, will lead more than 20 doctors, team members, and laborers to go south on the Shanghai-Pinghu train on the given day and arrive in Shanghai on the Lantern Festival. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Office is preparing to welcome them and has designated the old site of the Shanghai Branch on Julaida Road as the reception center.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Meeting Record of the Jisheng Society <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society held a committee meeting yesterday, attended by more than 20 people. Mr. Wang Yiting was publicly elected as the chairman to report on the relief efforts in the 22nd year. It is estimated that two porridge factories were opened in the spring at the Baiyi Convent and Chaoyangmen outside of Beijing, and seeds were transported to Wugong County, Shaanxi, including 1,700 dan of white rice. There was also relief work for the Guangfeng Dike Project in Jiangxi. In the summer, various charitable organizations jointly provided relief for the bandit disaster in Zhengyangguan, Anhui. In the autumn, charitable organizations jointly provided relief for the Yellow River flood disaster in Heze County, Shandong, and the typhoon disaster in Baoshan, Chongming, Chuansha, and Qidong counties. In winter, two porridge factories were opened at the Baiyi Alley and Chaoyangmen outside of Beijing this year. This year, the porridge factories have been changed to rice distribution. In addition, 500 sets of cotton clothes were transported. The total amount spent on medicine throughout the year was approximately 17,000 yuan. The relief work that has not yet been completed is the winter relief work in Fuyang, Taihe, and Yingshang counties of Anhui. Mr. Feng Yangshan, a committee member, was publicly elected to handle it. However, due to bandits everywhere, there was no way to proceed, and he has returned to Shanghai. Now, Mr. Zhang Zefu has also sent a telegram saying that he will arrive in Shanghai immediately to beg for relief. One sluice of the Guangfeng Dike in Jiangxi has not yet been built, the funds for the Beijing porridge factories have not yet been raised, and the funds for the two porridge factories in the local area have not yet been delivered. Then, the number of receipts and expenditures for this year was reported. The total amount of receipts and expenditures for the entire year of the 22nd year was a total of 200,000 yuan, which is only two-thirds of the previous year. The depression situation is rare in previous years, so the disaster relief in various places has not been fully handled. Then, the relief work for this year was proposed. Committee member Feng Yangshan said that there are new wars in Zhejiang and Fujian, and the people who have fled and suffered as a result are especially pitiful. We should prepare to go to provide relief. Although the society does not have preparatory funds, it should call for them as soon as possible. There must be kind people who will rise up upon hearing the news, and it was resolved to pass it. Also, the Yangzhou porridge factory has been operated by the society for two years. This time, Mr. Li Lingsheng sent a letter requesting that the winter relief work continue. It was resolved to pass it. The society has always had a reputation for being realistic and pragmatic in handling relief work. Recently, disasters have been widespread, and the people are crying out for food. Winter relief and spring relief both require funds everywhere. We hope that enthusiastic people will donate generously so that the society can actively carry out its work and benefit the disaster victims.</p>

He has already taken office and visited President Shen and called on President Qian and has taken over the work. Mr. Qian has been working to close the cases he is handling these days and will go to Wuxi to take office in the middle of this month. However, because Mr. Qian has been in office for many years, all the judges in the court will hold a public banquet at Xiangte today to bid him farewell.</p>

<p>Excellent Results and Opening at the Beginning of the Month</p>
<p>Implement Formal Commercial Telegrams</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that the direct Sino-British telegram communication from Shanghai to London, since the Ministry of Communications and the British Transport Company began preparing for it in April of last year, has been working hard to implement it. Now, all the large and small machines ordered from the UK arrived in Shanghai at the end of last year. The International Telegraph Office sent personnel to install the radio station project. As of the previous day, all the projects, such as antennas, transceivers, and small machines, have been installed. Other equipment is also complete. This great international communication work has been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Yesterday's Test Report <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The International Telegraph Office held a test report with the United Kingdom yesterday. At 3 p.m., Zhang Chenghu, Director of the Receiving and Dispatching Office of the International Radio Station of the bureau, personally conducted the test report at the receiving and dispatching office in Sassoon House. He began the power generation work on the transceiver. After passing through the Zhenru Radio Station, it went directly to London, England. Power generation lasted for an hour, and stopped at 4 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Excellent Results <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>It is said that the results of yesterday's test report were quite good. According to a Huadong News Agency reporter, London time is eight hours earlier than Shanghai. Therefore, when the receiving and dispatching office held the test report yesterday, it was 7 a.m. in London, England. The British side paid attention to the wavelength, sound band, speed, etc., issued from here, and scheduled to draft a report on the results of the power generation from here to there at 11 p.m. last night to inform Shanghai by telegram. In order to be cautious, the International Telegraph Office plans to hold this test report for a week to explore whether there are any shortcomings in the project that can be improved.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Preparing for the Opening <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>After a week of test reports starting yesterday, the International Telegraph Office has submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to approve the opening date.

<p>The Ministry of Communications has had this intention for Sino-British telegram communication from Shanghai to London since the summer of the year before last. At that time, it convened telecommunications experts from the ministry to discuss the outline of this method. After the decision, it signed a contract with the British Transport Company and purchased telecommunications equipment from that country. In April of last year, the Ministry of Communications ordered the International Telegraph Office to engage in the construction of a radio station project in Zhenru. By the winter of last year, all the machines required for the radio station had been shipped from England to Shanghai. At this point, the Telegraph Office more actively carried out installation work, and all the work was completed recently. The total cost of the equipment reached 64,000 pounds sterling.

<p>Mr. Chu first said that the military operations against Min have been reporting victories frequently. Now, Xiamen has been recovered following Yanping and Shuikou by our Central Army.

<p>Then, the reporter asked whether Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, had conveyed the opinions of the Southwest to the Central Government after returning to Beijing from his trip south, and how the Central Government would respond.

Mr. Chu also continued that there has been no news from Xinjiang recently. The reason for my trip to Shanghai this time is to attend the memorial service for my fellow villager, Mr. Zhou Xiangling, and to attend the memorial service held at the Hu She tomorrow.</p>

Three proposals were passed, and a letter to fellow seamen was published. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e175">Representatives Attending <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>

<h3 id="e176">Meeting Order <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>㈠ All stand at attention, ㈡ Sing the party song, ㈣ Bow to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of the Generalissimo, ㈣ The chairman respectfully reads the Generalissimo's will, ㈤ Observe three minutes of silence, ㈥ Chairman's report, ㈦ Speeches, ㈧ Proposals, ㈨ Shout slogans, ㈩ Adjournment.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Chairman's Report <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Yu Jiayong reported, roughly saying, "Fellow comrades, fellow representatives, the significance of holding today's anti-rebellion rally is that our sailors should understand that this rebellion in Fujian is a crime of endangering the Republic of China and ruining the nation. Now that the central government's campaign against the rebellion is winning victory after victory, our sailors should indirectly and directly help the central government to eliminate the rebellion. Today's crisis in China is more serious than at any time in the past, and a few unstable elements entrenched in Fujian, such as Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu, want to satisfy their private desires and do not hesitate to go against the tide of history, willingly selling the life of the Chinese nation and creating this absurd pseudo-organization. This is indeed the same as the rebellious and traitorous acts of Yuan Shikai, Chen Jiongming, and others, and their crimes are punishable. The first result of their rebellion is to give Japan a good opportunity to invade China. Japan's invasion of China is not limited to the Northeast, and all coastal provinces are within the scope of Japanese invasion. Foreign forces often use brainless and opinionless warlords to create chaos in China. This Fujian Incident is no exception. Second, because today China wants social stability and the smooth progress of national construction, the premise is to eliminate the Red bandits. Now the central government is surrounding and blockading the Red bandits in Jiangxi, and it is not difficult to say that they will be wiped out in a short period of time. However, the rebels in Fujian have given the Red bandits the rice and salt they need to prolong their lives as an exchange condition for not infringing on each other, and have provided the Red bandits with a place to cause trouble in western Fujian. Therefore, all the people of the country, as long as they understand right and wrong and have opinions, cannot bear to see the rebellious Fujian act of ruining the nation and the country. Therefore, all localities have requested the central government to send troops to suppress the rebellion. The inevitable process of revolution is that first, there must be a sincere spirit; second, there must be methods; and third, there must be a theory. The rebels in Fujian, Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, etc., have forced public opinion to satisfy their ambitions, have long betrayed the revolutionary stance, and have deviated from the revolutionary reality. They have put forward many slogans, such as 'land to the tiller,' which are actually deceiving the people. Our party's land policy has very concrete methods in the writings of the late Premier Sun, which show us that the so-called 'land to the tiller' of the rebels is not feasible in theory or in fact. Therefore, this rebellion is bound to collapse. However, after this rebellion, not only will the vitality of Fujian be greatly lost, but the impact on the whole country will not be small." After the chairman's report, Chen Songping, secretary of the Seamen's Party Department, and others continued to speak, and the words were omitted for brevity.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Three Motions Passed <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The following three motions were passed: ㈠ Send a telegram to comfort the anti-rebellion soldiers at the front; ㈡ Send a telegram to Chairman Chiang, asking the soldiers at the front to quickly put down the rebellion; ㈢ Send a circular telegram to sailors across the country, to help the anti-rebellion troops. The above telegrams will be drafted by the conference recorder and published on the same day after being reviewed by the chairman.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Conference Slogans <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>㈠ Assist the central government in suppressing Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen, who are causing disaster in Fujian; ㈡ Support the central government in rescuing the people of Fujian from the abyss of misery; ㈢ Punish Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen, who have betrayed the party and the country; ㈣ Support the central government in suppressing the rebellious and reactionary elements in Fujian; ㈤ Eliminate the pseudo-People's Government; ㈥ Punish Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen, who are harming the party and the country by colluding with Japan and the Communist Party; ㈦ Eliminate all reactionary elements who are harming the country and the people; ㈧ Support the Kuomintang of China.</p>

Therefore, in terms of public security, it has been decided to establish a model police district in the central urban area, which will be ordered by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to conduct detailed research and prepare a plan report for submission for selection. However, after the establishment in the future, whether its affiliation will still belong to the scope of the Public Security Bureau or directly to the municipal government still needs to be finally decided.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Qiujiang Wharf <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Secondly, the prosperity of the central urban area is most closely related to the construction of the Qiujiang Wharf. Shanghai is a major trading port, with ships coming and going and masts gathering like clouds. If there is no wharf for berthing, cargo transportation will be difficult to load and unload, and commerce will not be able to prosper. Therefore, the Qiujiang Wharf occupies the most important page in the realization of the Greater Shanghai Plan. Therefore, after the mayor proposed a discussion at today's meeting, he has decided to order the Finance and Public Works Bureaus to immediately follow the previously proposed plan, take a further step, prepare all practical and effective measures, and submit them to the municipal government for decision, so that they can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Welcome Investment <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>In addition, the mayor believes that the construction of a city is limited if it relies solely on the power of the government. It must have the support of the whole people, with active investment from the financial and industrial circles. Therefore, in the plan, the municipal government welcomes citizens to actively invest in all construction in the central urban area. The municipal government will formulate investment methods and officially announce them.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Special Meeting <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The above three plans are limited to the responsible departments to prepare them completely within two weeks and report them to the municipal government for collection and discussion. After the departments report, the municipal government will hold a special meeting within two weeks to propose a discussion and decide on the direction of progress.</p>

<p>Secretary-General Yu then talked about other municipal situations, saying that the water and electricity problems in the central urban area have been completely completed since the municipal government moved in, and the post office was also officially established a few days ago. As for the future round-road buses in the central urban area, the tram plan in the north and south cities, the power grid plan, and the Songhu branch line and other issues, they will be gradually realized, taking into account the priority and urgency and the financial resources. However, the construction of the Qiujiang Wharf is currently the top priority, so the goal is to achieve the completion of the project first.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Rushing to Build Housing <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>As for the construction of residential areas in the central urban area, more than 40 mu of land have been taken away since the municipal government valued and distributed them twice. More than 30 residential buildings built by the Xingye Trust Company have already started construction and can be completely completed by the end of April this year. The citizens who have taken the land have recently been taking out donation certificates from the Public Works Bureau and will start construction in the short term. The Shanghai and China banks will start construction soon. Later, the reporter passed by the residential area built by the Xingye Trust Company and saw that the four walls were already firm and were being rushed to build.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Financial Issues <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>He continued, "The city's finances have not yet recovered to the state before the January 28th Incident. However, we are living within our means and cutting expenses as much as possible, so we are not too tight. The Finance Bureau will have a detailed report on the details within the day. Although we wanted to create an unprecedented precedent for education funding this time, there were arrears. But now the Finance Bureau is trying its best to raise funds, and it can be allocated soon. As for the fund for the construction of the central urban area, it is still kept independently. It was not used even when the city's finances were so difficult during the January 28th Incident."</p>

<p>Secretary-General Yu also said that since the municipal government moved into the new building, it has been felt that the past official documents were cumbersome and complicated, and every official matter had to go through many procedures before it could be completed, which was time-consuming and laborious, and was not conducive to work efficiency. Therefore, since this year, in order to increase efficiency and speed, all official documents have been simplified, and the responsible departments will handle them according to the nature of each event, except for those that must be personally reviewed by the mayor and secretary-general. In addition, the municipal government and various bureaus have also newly formulated measures for contact and negotiation, whether they have moved or not, in order to be quick and convenient.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Two Months in Prison</p>
<p>Indian Laxin was accused of fighting with Chinese shoemaker Hu and biting off part of Hu's ear. The British Consulate Police Department opened a trial on Wednesday and questioned witnesses. A court hearing was reopened a few days ago to continue questioning witnesses about what they saw at the time. Then he asked the defendant why Hu's ear was missing a part. The defendant replied that Hu had probably cut it off himself or asked his friend to do so in order to sue him. Therefore, the interrogator ruled that the reason for the case was that the two sides had different opinions, but in any case, the defendant should not have bitten off part of the person's ear, so he should be sentenced to two months in prison.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Staff of the Parcel Department of the Directorate General of Posts Use Canceled Stamps for Profit <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Prosecuted After Being Discovered by Inspectors</p>
<p>Chen Kesheng, a native of Wenzhou and an employee of the Parcel Department of the Directorate General of Posts on North Suzhou Road, used canceled stamps for profit between October 22 last year and January 9 this year. Recently, he was discovered by Ge Fei, an inspector of the bureau, and reported to the postmaster. The Hongkou Police Station was dispatched on the previous day to send Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Chen and take him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The lawyer of the police station, Yu Yaotang, stated that the defendant was in charge of a large number of postal items such as various books and leaflets sent to other ports. According to the regulations, a triplicate book was used, which was of three types: A, B, and C. The Ai character was for the stub, the Pi character was pasted on the package, and the Xi character was for the receipt for the customer. The number of such documents was quite large, and the defendant had to estimate the number of stamps to be affixed. He secretly took down the stamps covered with seals on the Pi character package, used fraud to alter them, and pasted them on the triplicate book, which could be reused as a receipt for the customer's Xi character, and profited from it. He was discovered by Inspector Ge. He went to the World Bookstore, a postal customer, and brought back the receipt. When comparing it with the triplicate book, the stamps were inconsistent. When he questioned the defendant, he denied it. He immediately checked the number of tickets sold and calculated that it was 805 yuan, 1 dime and 7 cents. Because the bureau issued stamps every time to the tune of 800 yuan, and would pay again after they were sold out, there was never a large number. At this point, he admitted that each time he committed fraud, it was only tens of yuan. It is difficult to find out the exact amount of money he took in this way. Please investigate and deal with it severely to warn others. He then presented a bundle of triplicate receipts. Then, the inspector testified about the process and said that the defendant had been working in the bureau for ten years and his monthly salary was 90 yuan. When asked about the defendant, he stammered and said that he was confused for a while and took this unwise measure, and it only lasted for three months. Please forgive him. Judge Xiao Fenfen ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled a sentence.</p>

<p>Famous Dramas are Performing at the Hong Kong Grand Theatre. Since the Hong Kong Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road hired the Cantonese opera troupe Qunfang Yanying to perform in Shanghai, the seats have been full. The reason is that the troupe has many famous actors, all of whom are able to attract audiences. Among the entire troupe, the flower Dan Xiaoyaoxian is considered the most popular. The graceful Xiaoling has long been famous in Hong Kong and Guangdong. Not only is she famous in the opera world, but she also has considerable skills in film.

Luo Zhanchun, the former owner of the Guangwu Stage, and a famous Cantonese actor surnamed Chen, who recently came to Shanghai, are cooperating to invite actors who have been famous in Guangdong and Hong Kong to come to Shanghai in order to attract audiences, because they will not succeed without famous actors and good dramas.

<h3 id="e219">Several Questions Regarding the Choice of Subjects to Study <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>| Discussion on the subjects selected by readers in applications, letters, and questionnaires |</p>
<p>We have a clearer understanding of the readers' "desire to study" and "personal circumstances" from the returned "questionnaires," "applications," and letters, but we still feel vague about the readers' "purpose of studying," and the subjects selected are also lacking in a system, not very suitable, and some readers even only know that they want to study but don't know why, and only know that they want to learn a major, but don't know which one. In the "What subject do you want to study now" column in the application form, some people even wrote "Lost in the sea of learning, I don't know what to choose, but I urgently hope to have a major to study" without filling in a subject; Most of the others have filled in the subjects they want to study, but if we make a guidance or a "research method" according to their subjects, we can conclude that the effect is probably limited. Because the subjects filled in are either too many, or these subjects are too specialized to be studied, or they are not suitable for their needs: In short, the subjects they have chosen, according to our knowledge of the readers' environment, cannot be appropriately coordinated with their life situation:</p>
<p>Regarding the "purpose of studying," we have repeatedly stated in "On Self-Study" and "The Reading Guidance We Need," namely, "We are for the sake of practicality, to understand actual life, and how to struggle to develop our own or the public's life." and "Reading is a means, not an end." Although the purpose stated by the readers does not fundamentally conflict with ours, it is too general to say "to understand the content of the book to get rich knowledge" or to say "to get considerable knowledge." Therefore, first, we hope that readers have a deep understanding of the "purpose of studying."</p>
<p>Most of our readers, that is, those who participate in "reading guidance," are young shop assistants, office workers, apprentices, and employees of various other enterprises. Their education is about the level of higher primary school or junior high school, their income is usually mostly between 20 and 30 yuan, and their reading time is only one or two hours on average. We know that it is not practical to want to study Einstein's theory of relativity without even understanding elementary algebra; to want to study five or six subjects with only one or two hours of leisure every day; or to hope to prepare a lot of money to buy books when even life can only be勉强maintain. Therefore, we only hope that they can acquire sufficient common sense about what they want to study. As for whether they will become scholars or experts, it depends on their personal efforts and their environment. We don't think so. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I am writing to you regarding a news report in your newspaper on January 11, stating that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has officially taken over two sea vessels after the Central Army's victory in Fujian. After investigation, the price of the two vessels is to be paid in installments, and the payment period has not yet expired, so they have not been taken over. Moreover, after the price is paid in full, obtaining a nationality certificate and registering the ownership in accordance with the Ship Law are all procedures that should be handled in accordance with maritime administration, and have nothing to do with the Central Army's victory in Fujian. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, The General Manager's Office of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, January 12.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, The news about the labor dispute at Meifeng Silk Factory, as reported in your newspaper's New Year's Joint Special Issue and in recent days, is inconsistent with the facts and lacks accuracy. After investigation, the factory's capital is 50,000 yuan in total. Since its establishment, there has been a slight surplus, but it has since declined and has suffered a net loss of approximately 200,000 yuan in recent years, which is more than four times the amount of capital. All assets are mortgaged to the hilt. Mr. Ni Dachun, the founder of the factory, is enthusiastic about industry and has not dared to lag behind others. However, due to the impact of the silk industry's bankruptcy, he was unable to save the situation and had no choice but to close the business. His pain is greater than that of the workers. He definitely did not close the business to protect his capital. The books are all there and cannot be concealed. When the closure was announced, workers Li Xichun and Wang Xianyue made a loud noise and were taken to the police station for questioning by the police officers present, and were immediately released. This was a matter of the police officers' authority and did not involve our client. Entrusted by our client, we are writing to present the facts and request that they be published immediately for correction. Respectfully, Lawyer Jiang Baoli, January 12, 23rd year.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Father Lu's "Cheat" Zhan Lu <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Since the Republic of China, many important figures in the military and political circles have become monks. In the past, there was Cheng Xuelou; in modern times, there was Sun Xinyuan; others, such as Duan Zhiqian, are even more countless. It is not surprising that they have become Chinese monks; what is most surprising is that Mr. Lu Zhengxiang, who served as the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the early years of the Republic of China, served as the Chinese Chief Representative at the Paris Peace Conference in the eighth year of the Republic of China, and served as the Chinese Minister to Switzerland in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, is now a foreign-style monk, wearing ancient clothes and hats, vowing to cultivate in a monastery in Belgium, spending a lonely life in the ancient temple bells. From the sixteenth year of the Republic of China to this year, it has been seven or eight years, which is truly a special figure in the history of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Recently, someone went to the monastery to visit Mr. Lu, the former Prime Minister and now a priest, and asked him about his feelings about the ancestral country. He said: "The world is a deception; China is a country of deception; the family is a family where family members and fathers deceive each other; society is a society where relatives and friends deceive each other; in the former Qing Dynasty, promotion and wealth were deceptive banners; in the Republic of China, personal territory is the deceptive goal; the former exploited the people; the latter exploits them even more. I have been an official in the former Qing Dynasty and worked in the Republic of China. I am also one of the cheaters in the country of deception; however, now I have jumped out of the shackles of deception and restored my natural face."</p>
<p>Father Lu's "cheat" is unusually incisive. In an era of rampant human desires, hearing him talk about cheating can really be compared to a dose of cooling powder. What other irreconcilable hatred is there? Alas! Knowing that it is all a deception, why bother to waste your form, waste your spirit, increase your sins, and arouse your ambitions? Unfortunately, until the appropriate time comes, no one will admit that they are one of the cheaters! No one is willing to jump out of the shackles of cheating! No one is willing to restore my natural face! Then the world will be troubled from then on.</p>
<p>The world is inherently peaceful, but cheaters disturb it themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Bumping into Nails Xie Chengxun <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The term "bumping into nails" is often associated with the term "bad luck"; because in the minds of ordinary people, it is believed that "bumping into nails" is the cause, and "bad luck" is the effect. Because "bad luck" is what most people, especially those who call themselves modern, are most unwilling to do, so "bumping into nails" is equally despised by people.</p>
<p>In fact, in the current society, which is full of thorns, there are too many opportunities for people to "bump into nails." If you can have a proper understanding of it, you can regard "bumping into nails" as not a big deal; However, most people nowadays, especially young students, have never tasted the feeling of "bumping into nails" in school. When they leave school and enter society, they think it is "bad luck" when they "bump" into "nails." From this, they feel that society is always evil, and reduce most of their courage to work hard for society in the past, or even become negative, pessimistic, decadent, and slowly embark on the road of "taking care of themselves," causing a great crisis in the future of society.</p>
<p>Since "bumping into nails" is an inevitable fact in the current society, I think we should not despise "bumping into nails," nor should we be afraid of "bumping into nails," and we should not think that "bumping into nails" is "bad luck"; and we need to view "bumping into nails" as follows: "Bumping" into "nails" once increases one point of knowledge, the more "nails" are "bumped" into, the more you can have a deep understanding of the ways of the world and human relationships; in other words: the more you can approach the road to success, so I personally welcome "bumping into nails," and I hope my comrades have more!</p>
<h3 id="e223">Starting from Hugging the Quilt Yu Renwei <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>People seem to be especially good at sleeping in winter. The young masters and ladies of Hillchoya almost all have the habit of "not getting out of bed until after lunch"; anyway, the school is on holiday, and someone at home takes care of everything, so they are happy to stay in the quilt for a while.</p>
<p>Not to mention rich people, even us poor kids have felt these days that it is really an unusually painful and difficult thing to get up and get dressed in the cold weather, something that only a great hero can do. Sometimes I also recite the sentence "Get up at dawn" in Mr. Zhu Bolu's Family Governance Motto several times, thinking that this will immediately give me enough courage to pull my head out of the quilt, but as soon as I touch the cold air outside, I feel that all thoughts are lost, and I shrink my head back in without resistance; from then on, I never recover, and I don't want to get up at all.</p>
<p>Hugging the quilt can of course avoid the temporary cold, but it is not a long-term solution; all the expenses at home have to be earned by myself; if I don't get up one day, I will have to go hungry for one day; then, should we still muster up the courage, lift the quilt, break the temporary cold, and seek permanent comfort?</p>
<p>Our volunteer army, since there was no food, grass, or bullets in the past, and no reinforcements to support them, could not withstand the attacks of the enemy's scientific weapons, and finally collapsed. The so-called anti-Japanese heroes now are either recuperating in the mountains, or shining shoes and pulling rickshaws in Shanghai. What is the difference between this and those who cannot withstand the cold and have to hug the quilt?</p>
<p>Since the Xinhai Revolution, our country has always been plagued by internal and external troubles, fighting and pressing each other, and cannot withstand the economic and military aggression of imperialists. Although it has led to rural bankruptcy and urban collapse, it has not woken up at all until now. What is the difference between this and hugging the quilt and eating temporary peace?</p>
<h3 id="e224">Acting and Living Wu Jiren <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Society can only be organized when people interact with each other, which is just like the behavior of an acting troupe. A person in society is like a role in an acting troupe. There are sheng, dan, jing, chou, painted faces, and clowns in the troupe. There are good, evil, loyal, and treacherous people in society, so watching a play is like watching a microcosm of society. However, the roles in the acting troupe are assigned by the troupe leader, and the masses in society are determined and expressed by their own behavior.</p>
<p>The best thing to do as a person is to be indifferent to the world, you are you, I am me. If you can't do that, then you have to join society to play a role. But rather than playing a white-faced villain or a heinous clown in society, it is better to play an upright old man with a beard or a romantic and elegant young man. It's more interesting.</p>
<p>Because there are only a few decades in a lifetime, why be so vicious and forcefully plunder to be scolded and despised? It's better to let go and be a dignified man.</p>
<p>There is a kind of person in the world who is often self-smart, "see fierce avoid, see good bully," "see the big Buddha and worship, see the small Buddha and kick," and also adds that he is full of money, pretending to be the richest man in the world, arrogant and tyrannical, using means to deal with friends everywhere, and people let him some, he takes the lead in everything. As the old saying goes, "Man has a thousand plans, but heaven has only one," although those superstitious words are not what people of the 20th century should say, but the Westerners also pay attention to the theory of cause and effect. I come to advise the world, don't go to the end of the road, don't think that you can "sell people" with money, you must know that although the world has become a ghost, justice still exists, I advise you not to be a "clown" again, but to change to a "upright old man with a beard" to play.</p>

<p>Whispered Words of Earnest Advice to Weak Offspring Before the Lamp</p>
<p>Coldly Observing Heroes Below the Mountain with a Walking Stick</p>
<p>The weather was good on this day, and there were quite a few people coming to see the red leaves. Downstairs at the Western Hills Restaurant, twenty or thirty seats were full. Along the cliffside, a flat area held seven or eight cars. Two of the cars even had military flags planted on them. Old Zhao, dragging his jujube wood cane, said softly to Ji Zhi, "Mr. Gan, look, there are so many men and women here. Is there anyone dressed like me, wearing a blue cloth padded jacket and dragging a jujube wood cane?" Ji Zhi laughed and said, "They run the restaurant, we come to spend money. We don't owe them a penny. What right do they have to tell us what to wear?" As he said this, he disregarded everything and walked into the tea area. However, every seat was taken. Walking past them, under a pedestrian bridge, there was a flat, open space, with a hillside behind it and a flower garden in front. There were four rattan chairs and two tea tables, but no one had sat down yet. This was because the view was blocked by a row of trees and hedges, preventing a distant view. One could only turn around and look at the mountain scenery behind the building. Ji Zhi wanted to see the red leaves on the mountain, so he smiled at Old Zhao and said, "People come to see the red leaves, but they don't sit in a place like this. Instead, they squeeze into the dining area to eat Western food and drink coffee. Isn't that a joke? Please, sit down, please sit down!" So, he moved a rattan chair, facing the mountain, and pulled out a handkerchief from his sleeve, constantly dusting off the chair. Old Zhao said, "You're too kind," and sat down as well. The waiter in the restaurant saw that Ji Zhi was wearing a Western suit and had a very generous manner, not like a poor man. So, he came over to prepare tea and snacks, only glancing at Old Zhao a few extra times. Old Zhao reclined on the rattan chair, looking at the opposite mountain. The scattered temples, amidst the sparse trees, were mostly exposed. In the mountain recesses, occasionally one or two red trees were illuminated by the sunlight, very bright and dazzling. Old Zhao pointed and laughed, "That's enough. If the whole mountain was covered in red leaves..." Before he could finish his sentence, a large handful of melon seed shells fell from the sky, scattering all over his head and body. (290)</p>

<p>Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, wrote to the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office, stating, "It is found that schools have higher expenses at the beginning of the semester and are in greater need of funds. In recent years, educational funds have not been distributed monthly, and schools often rely on student fees paid at the beginning of the semester to manage. Starting next semester, the provincial schools have been ordered to waive tuition and accommodation fees, and the funds that schools rely on to manage are gone. In addition, the winter vacation this year begins before the Lunar New Year, making it even more difficult to manage finances. It is difficult to cope. Accordingly, I am writing to request that your office consider the actual situation and find a way to raise funds for one month before the winter vacation for each school, and allocate it as soon as possible to meet the urgent need. Is this feasible? Please review and respond accordingly." The funds for the first half of December for the Jiangsu Provincial Rural Normal School and Experimental Elementary School have been cleared on the 6th of this month. The payment notification for the first half of November for middle schools and normal schools (the second half of November for social education and vocational schools) has been issued by the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office on the 10th of this month. Schools are expected to receive the cash around the 15th. (All schools have an 18-day winter vacation according to the Ministry's regulations, and all can receive half a month's funds before the vacation. The Education Funds Audit Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of the 10th and signed the payment notification for the second half of December and the first half of January for rural normal schools and experimental elementary schools (the second half of November and the first half of December for middle schools and normal schools, and the entire month of December for social education and vocational schools). It can be sent to the Department of Education for stamping on the 11th. However, the date of disbursement still depends on when there are funds in the treasury. It is also heard that the Education Funds Management Office borrowed a total of 370,000 yuan from various counties last year, and also used busy season taxes as collateral to borrow from the bank for twenty-two years. (The principal of 12,000 yuan is due on February 20th and March 20th) Therefore, funds have always been disbursed monthly.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Measures for Regular Examination of Primary and Secondary School Student Performance by Educational Administrative Organs <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 12th), the Ministry of Education announced ten articles of measures for regular examination of the academic performance of students in secondary and primary schools by educational administrative organs at all levels, and at the same time issued a circular to the education departments of all provinces and cities to comply with them, saying, "The examination of the academic performance of students in primary and secondary schools, in addition to the regular examinations held by schools, should also be strictly assessed by educational administrative organs. In peacetime, the method of random examination by branch school and subject is used to measure whether the teaching progress of each subject is appropriate and whether the teaching methods of each subject are appropriate. Then, the results obtained can be used as accurate guidance, in order to improve teaching effectiveness. This is actually more important than regular examinations. We have specially formulated measures for the regular examination of the academic performance of students in secondary and primary schools by educational administrative organs at all levels, and ordered them to be sent to the relevant departments for strict compliance starting from this semester, and to instruct all subordinates to comply with them uniformly. The ten articles of the examination measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: Educational administrative organs at all levels, in order to improve the teaching methods of each subject in secondary and primary schools and improve teaching effectiveness, should use examination methods in peacetime to examine the academic performance of students in the secondary and primary schools under their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Article 2: Educational administrative organs at all levels may designate schools, classes, or subjects at any time for the secondary and primary schools under their jurisdiction to conduct examinations. However, before the examination is conducted, the schools, classes, subjects, and dates of the examination should not be announced.</p>
<p>Article 3: The examination of the regular academic performance of students in provincial, municipal, and county-level secondary schools and approved private secondary schools, as well as provincial primary school students, shall be presided over by the Education Department and may designate school faculty and staff to assist in it. When necessary, the provincial Education Department may order the county and municipal educational administrative organs to handle it. The examination of the regular academic performance of students in county and municipal-level and approved private primary schools shall be presided over by the county and municipal educational administrative organs and may designate school faculty and staff to assist in it. When necessary, it may be handled directly by the Education Department. The examination of the regular academic performance of students in public and private secondary and primary schools in the municipal (municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan) districts shall be presided over by the municipal district educational administrative organs and shall be designated to assist the faculty and staff of the school.</p>
<p>Article 4: Each provincial, municipal, and district educational administrative organ shall conduct this examination at least once per academic year for the secondary school students under its jurisdiction. Each county and municipal educational administrative organ shall conduct this examination at least once per semester for the primary school students under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Article 5: When educational administrative organs at all levels conduct this examination, they should pay special attention to: 1) Junior middle schools that did not participate in the graduation examination last year; 2) Subjects with poor examination results; 3) Subjects that have not been examined in senior and junior high schools.</p>

<p>The International Educational Film Association of Rome, Italy, is the hub of international educational films. All educational films produced by various countries that have been reviewed and approved by the Association are called International Educational Films and can be circulated in various countries. Therefore, the educational films produced or managed by the Association are exceptionally excellent. The China Educational Film Association, in order to promote communication between Chinese and Western educational cultures, has specially ordered various educational films from the Association. The first batch of films has been shipped from Rome to Shanghai, including twelve films totaling 35 kilometers, such as Historical Rome, Eye Surgery, Tree Oil, Steel, Flowing Gas, Common Lung Diseases, From Egg to Chicken, and Ancient Black Gilt Lamps, worth a total of 12,158.10 Italian currency, with a total length of more than 5,000 feet, rich in content, and quite interesting. The second batch of films is said to be on the way, but these films all have Italian subtitles, which inevitably causes a gap for the audience. The China Educational Film Association is currently engaged in translating the subtitles and will release them to the public soon. Schools at all levels and social education institutions in our country are welcome to contact the association for screenings.</p>

<p>Due to the recent financial difficulties of the municipal government, the funds for municipal schools have been inevitably in arrears, causing panic among the schools.

<p>In the match between Jiangwan and Youbang, the situation was extremely tense in the first half. Both sides had wonderful performances. Jiangwan took the lead first, scoring four points. Afterwards, Youbang also relied on rapid connections, and the score was tied four times. After 10-10, Jiangwan suddenly made great progress, and the score quickly became 19-12. Youbang gradually showed signs of weakening. So Jiangwan took the opportunity to rise, and at the end of the first half, they led by ten points, with a score of 23-13. When the battle was restarted, Jiangwan's mood was peaceful, and they acted powerfully for a time. Although Youbang gained something, there was no improvement, and the difference remained between six and seven goals, and they surrendered. Again and again, from beginning to end, it was extremely compact and exciting. Afterwards, after Jiangwan's Zhao Butian and Chen Zongqi were penalized off the field, the situation became critical for a while, because Youbang was watching closely, and the score was once close, but in the end, because time was limited, they lost 48-39.</p>

<p>Similar to volleyball, it is very suitable for the elderly and women.</p>
<p>Legal Set Ball: A set ball is considered legal if it completely meets the following four conditions: (1) Each person must not set twice or more in a row (when setting with both hands, it is illegal if it is not lifted at the same time, or if it is set twice in a row with one hand, or if the sounds are inconsistent, and it is considered two or more consecutive sets); (2) The ball must not be paused in the palm of the hand; (3) When teammates on each side pass the set ball in the air within their own area, it must not exceed three times or be picked up again after landing (but if the ball falls on the net and does not pass through or land, it can be increased to four times); (4) Teammates setting the ball must stand in a legal area.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Rules During Attack and Defense <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>(1) During an attack, all players on both sides must not touch any part of the net or basket; (2) When a player jumps up and lands again, their feet must not cross the horizontal line under the net; (3) Players must not stand beyond the horizontal line; (4) When a player attacks, they may extend their hands or any part of their body over the top of the net to prevent the ball from entering the basket.</p>
<p>(5) Victory</p>
<p>The victory of this game is determined by the side that first scores twenty-two points. The victory of a match is determined by winning three of five sets. Every set, whichever side scores eleven points first, the sides switch positions once. (Note: The ball used for tennis can be replaced by a volleyball.)</p>
<p>(6) Appendix</p>
<p>The above rules have three special points. The reasons for them are explained as follows: (1) Rules During Attack and Defense, (4) Players may extend their hands over the top of the net during an attack (detailed earlier). This rule is a method to defend against balls entering the basket, because if it is not allowed to extend hands over the net, there will be no way to prevent the opponent from setting the ball into the basket; (2) Scoring, (6) Players intentionally commit fouls and lose two points (detailed earlier). The purpose of this rule is to avoid players from taking advantage. Because if Party A is attacking the ball into the basket and Party B commits a foul, moving the net basket to avoid the ball entering the basket, and the foul is still punished as an ordinary foul and counted as one point of failure, then Party A originally had the opportunity to score two points, but now only gets one point, which is quite unfair. Therefore, Rule (6) stipulates that they win two points, and the decision of this rule is up to the referee at the time. The referee should base on the above spirit to judge and must not arbitrarily decide that a certain party's ordinary foul is an intentional foul; (3) The second provision of the venue stipulates that the rectangle is moved, and the net height is two meters (two meters fifty for men) to avoid the fierce attack of spiking. Therefore, it is suitable for the physique of women. (End)</p>

<p>Another Asian Olympic Games Will Be Organized</p>
<p>Invite Asian Countries to Participate</p>
<p>The 10th Far Eastern Games will be held in Manila next summer. The puppet Manchuria also wants to participate. Its background is Japan, which is self-evident. The Philippines is in a dilemma and initiated a three-country peace conference to resolve the issue of the pseudo-state's participation. However, it was canceled due to China's firm opposition. According to recent news from the Japanese News Agency in Changchun, Japan has even more dangerous plans, advocating dissolving the Far Eastern Games and establishing a so-called "Far East Olympic Games," uniting Asian countries and "pseudo-Manchuria" to hold it. China and Canada will also be invited to participate. If China opposes, it will be excluded. The telegram said that the Japanese and Manchu Sports Associations, in view of the establishment of the pseudo-Manchu state, deeply believe that the current Far Eastern Games are no longer in line with the times and should be dissolved and canceled, and replaced by the "Asian Olympic Games," which should include India, the Soviet Union of Asia, and countries such as pseudo-Manchuria, in addition to China, Japan, and the Philippines. The Japanese and Manchu Associations have reached a consensus. If this summer's Far Eastern Games in Manila cannot be held due to China's opposition to pseudo-Manchuria's participation, the Far Eastern Games will be dissolved immediately. All Asian countries, including China, are invited to organize the so-called Asian Olympic Games. If China refuses to participate, the conference will still be held. The first conference is scheduled to be held in Tokyo next fall. If time is not enough, it will be postponed for one year. All facilities are similar to the Far Eastern Games. This telegram has been transmitted, and there are some clues. I wonder if our country's authorities have a countermeasure and method.</p>

<h3 id="e262">Circuit for Measuring Audio Frequency Amplification <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xuansheng</p>
<p>After a radio wave is converted into an audio frequency by a detector in a radio receiver and then amplified by a vacuum tube, its volume can be increased several times. The following circuit can be used to measure the amplification value.</p>
<p>In the diagram, the resistors R1 and R2 should be equal in value, and their value can be up to 10,000 ohms. R is a lower resistance, the magnitude of its value depends on the voltage supplied by the audio frequency alternator and the determined signal strength. r is a linear or circular sliding resistor. As shown in the figure, move the DPDT switch to the left, the earphones are connected via R, and when moved to the right, the earphones are connected to the output of the amplifier.</p>
<p>The measurement method is a comparative method, which compares the signal in the earphones when connected via R with the signal produced by the amplifier when connected via r.</p>
<p>The alternator is configured to the required voltage and frequency. The voltage is often configured to about 5 volts. The frequency can be adjusted to the determined frequency band. Draw an amplification curve to represent the frequency. Traditionally, 1000 cycles are often used to simplify the measurement.</p>
<p>After the signal strength has been adjusted by the resistors R1 and R2, the switch is moved back and forth, and the value of r is changed at the same time, until the same signal strength can be obtained in the earphones when the switch is in the front and rear positions. Because the resistors are in series, the current flowing through both sides is the same value. The voltage is proportional to the resistance; therefore, the ratio of the voltage passing through the earphones to the voltage input to the amplifier is equal to the ratio of R to r. Therefore, when the switch is in the front and rear positions and the signals are the same, its</p>
<p>Voltage amplification = R - r</p>
<p>To reduce any residual signal generated by coupling capacitance, one end of the slider and one side of the amplifier input can be grounded.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Suppose that in a certain measurement, R1 and R2 are 5000 ohms, R is 20 ohms, and r is 0.95 ohms, find the amplification value.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>R1 = R2 = 5000 Ohm</p>
<p>R = 20 Ohm</p>
<p>r = 0.95 Ohm</p>
<p>Formula</p>
<p>Voltage Amplification = R - r = 20 - 0.95 = 21.0</p>
<p>Voltage Amplification = 21.0 (End)</p>

<h3 id="e264">Loudspeaker Protection Method <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>In the final stage low-frequency amplification of radios, if powerful vacuum tubes are used, such tubes have especially large screen currents. If the loudspeaker is connected in series within the screen circuit, it is often easily damaged. To avoid losses, we must consider protective methods:</p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>(1) As shown in Figure 1, L is a low-frequency choke coil, connected in series in the screen circuit. The loudspeaker is connected in series with a fixed capacitor and then connected in parallel across the choke coil. This way, no screen current passes through the loudspeaker, but the oscillating low-frequency waves still pass through normally.</p>
<p>(2) Because in the first method, one terminal of the loudspeaker is directly connected to the high-voltage B supply, it is very easy to get an electric shock if one is not careful when using it. There are two ways to remedy this:</p>
<p>a. Add a fixed capacitor with the same capacitance as C at point X.</p>
<p>b. Instead of adding a capacitor, directly connect the X wire to the ground wire (as shown by the dashed line in the figure).</p>
<p>(3) Without using a choke coil and capacitor, a single output transformer can also protect the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>Regardless of which protection method is used, the most important thing is that the AC resistance of L must be equal to the AC resistance of the final stage vacuum tube's screen electrode to obtain the maximum output power. If you want to obtain the maximum undistorted output power, then the AC resistance of L should be twice the AC resistance of the screen electrode.</p>

<p>(1) Simple Method for Identifying Current Polarity</p>
<p>To distinguish the positive and negative poles of a current, polarity test paper is usually used, which was introduced in issue 42 of this publication. This article introduces several simple methods that readers can try:</p>
<p>(1) Take a sweet potato, cut it in half at the waist, insert the positive and negative wires, and after a while, observe the color next to the two wires: the one with a purple-green color is the positive polarity; the one with no effect is the negative polarity.</p>
<p>(2) Add edible salt to a cup of water, insert the two wires, and the electrode with bubbles attached is the negative electrode; conversely, it is the positive electrode.</p>
<p>(3) For low-voltage wires, the positive and negative poles can also be distinguished with the tongue: when the wire touches the tip of the tongue, the one that feels slightly numb and itchy is the positive electrode; the one with no taste is the negative electrode.</p>
<p>(2) Ready-Made Antenna</p>
<p>This publication has already introduced how to use telephone lines and electric light wires as antennas. Now there is another type of ready-made antenna: the author once used a roof gutter as an antenna, connecting the lead-in wire to the part of the gutter that runs parallel to the roof, and the reception was also not bad.</p>
<p>(3) Using Carbon to Make a Crystal Detector</p>
<p>Take out the carbon rod from a discarded battery, crush it, select the more regular ones and soak them in a lead acetate (obtained by dissolving lead or lead monoxide in acetic acid) solution for a few minutes. Then, take it out and sprinkle calcium sulfide on all parts of the carbon, and then apply sulfuric acid to the surface.</p>

<h3 id="e268">(23) Vacuum Tube Detector <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(1) Vacuum Tube Detection: Regardless of the type of radio, it must have a detection circuit to convert the radio frequency current received by the antenna into an audio frequency current. Vacuum tubes have a rectifying effect, so they can be used for detection. A radio that uses a vacuum tube for detection is called a vacuum tube detection radio. The commonly called "one-tube radio" belongs to this category.</p>
<p>There are two different methods of vacuum tube detection: one is the so-called grid leak detection (Grid Detection), which uses a grid leak resistor (GridLeak) and a grid capacitor (GrjdCondenser) for detection, and the other is the plate detection (PlateDetectjoo), which does not use a grid leak resistor or a grid capacitor, but uses a C battery.</p>
<p>(2) Plate Detection: The plate current of a vacuum tube, like a crystal detector, has a unidirectional characteristic. Plate detection utilizes this characteristic to perform detection. Figure 1 shows its standard connection method. By appropriately increasing or decreasing the C battery, the plate current is brought close to zero. At this time, if a high-frequency voltage is generated in the tuned circuit, the positive voltage in it will cause the plate current to flow, thereby achieving the purpose of detection.</p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>(3) Grid Detection: Figure 2 shows the connection method of grid detection. The most important thing is to use the so-called unidirectional property of the grid current between the grid and the filament to perform the detection function. When the grid voltage is positive, there is grid current flowing between the grid and the filament; conversely, if the grid voltage is negative, there is no grid current. Therefore, when a high-frequency voltage is generated in the tuned circuit, if the voltage is positive, grid current will flow. As a result, an audio voltage will inevitably be generated across the grid leak resistor (Rg) and the grid capacitor (Cg). This audio voltage is amplified and generated in the plate circuit, and then becomes an audio current flowing into the headphones. In this method, the vacuum tube serves both detection and amplification functions.</p>
<p>(4) Comparison of the Two Detection Methods: The two detection methods mentioned above each have their advantages and disadvantages. Which is better cannot be generalized. However, grid detection has better sensitivity and is used by many. A table comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the two is given below.</p>

<p>| The Result is Still Slightly Better by 1.2 Yuan |</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Fluctuates and Is Profitable</p>
<p>Negative Overseas News Ultimately Suffers Setbacks</p>
<p>The gold market was firm and then tired yesterday. Although the trend was firm, it could not be supported in the end due to unfavorable overseas telegrams. However, the result was still higher than the previous close. In the morning, although the overseas silver market rose, the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose only slightly, and the exchange rate tended to fall. The price of pure gold did not move. American wheat fell by 1.125, American cotton rose by 6 pounds. Except for stocks falling slightly and rising by 90 yuan, the opening was extremely good in the morning due to news of stable exchange rates. After opening, the exchange market hardened due to bank congestion. A Reuters telegram from Washington said that the US government would issue 125 million yuan of treasury bills today. Under the efforts of speculator Mr. Wu and others to sell heavily, the 90 yuan mark was gradually broken. Later, the banks came to consolidate, and the market was still flat. However, a Reuters telegram said that the US Silver Group meeting had been decided, but the content had not been announced.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Stock Exchange was due to the Min army wanting to hold on to Fuzhou in the southwest and troops were heading to the Min border, the purpose was unclear, and the market was slightly skeptical. In addition, No. 46 still had a large amount of selling, but it seemed to have a limit price. The multiple long positions also had a swap period. The market price hovered and brought fatigue. It was said that the central government wanted to end the war before the Fourth Plenary Session, so the attack was quite urgent, while the Min side wanted to postpone it until after the Fourth Plenary Session and firmly hold Fuzhou, hoping to get a solution at the Fourth Plenary Session. In this atmosphere of shock, the public debt market seemed to be in a dilemma of advancing and retreating. The future of the bond market is probably still a lot of back and forth. At the morning opening, there was a lot of scattered selling and multiple long position swapping, and the market price fell uniformly by 2-3 to 6-7 corners. In the second market, No. 5 and No. 15 were slightly needed, and the sellers were slightly sparse, and the market price was slightly firm, but the salt tax of No. 46 sold for 49 yuan outside was very popular, so it struggled from beginning to end. In the afternoon, only one market was made, and the multiple long positions still had swapping and cage release. No. 46 still had selling, and the trend was slightly tired. The market price resulted in a small return of 1-2 corners to 1 yuan. Only the customs treasury bills of No. 22 rose by 2 yuan. The trend was chaotic. The total transaction volume was 17.785 million yuan, including 10,000 yuan in cash, 5.45 million yuan in spot salt tax, 3.21 million yuan in disarmament, 1.71 million yuan in 19 customs duties, 3.35 million yuan in 20 volumes and 20 customs duties, and 2.16 million yuan in gold short positive six, and the rest were tens of thousands to 2-300,000.

<p>The yarn market fell again, rising and falling suddenly. There were rumors in the market that a Shantou yarn shop went bankrupt with huge losses, but the inventory was still thick. Although the sales of current yarn were more active than last year, large transactions were still difficult to improve. Moreover, the demand for cotton yarn was still sluggish due to the high price. The most lively trend in recent days was the goods in the exchange, and the price was 4-5 yuan cheaper than the yarn in the factory. According to Japanese surveys, there were more than 138,000 bales of yarn in stock at the end of December, an increase of more than 15,000 bales compared to the previous month.</p>

<p>Cotton has risen for many days, and the market situation has shown a slight reaction. However, the foreign cotton situation is still firm, so the market is still hard. However, multiple long positions have taken profits in large quantities when the price rises, and the market is slightly relaxed. The demand for current cotton is more from foreign factories. The multiple long positions in Yonggang have not yet been released, and the idea of looking higher is still strong, but it has already risen by 3 yuan, 5, 6 corners compared to the lower price.</p>

<p>Total: 138,925 Bales</p>
<p>Increase of 15,362 Bales Compared to Last Month</p>
<p>According to a survey by a Japanese trading company, the total cotton yarn inventory in Shanghai at the end of December of the 22nd year [of the Republic] amounted to 138,925 bales, an increase of 15,362 bales compared to the end of November. Among them, Japanese yarn accounted for 15,685 bales, an increase of 6,932 bales compared to the end of November, while Chinese and English yarn accounted for 123,240 bales, an increase of 8,430 bales compared to the end of November. The reason for the increase in cotton yarn is attributed to the independence of Fujian, the unstable political situation, the sluggish public sentiment, the tightening of finance, the dull sales in various regions, and the collapse of Osaka Sanpin yarn, which greatly affected exports. The breakdown of Japanese factory yarn stocks is listed below:</p>
<p>8-count: 125, 16-count: 2,040, 40-count: 1,860</p>

<p>After the opening of the flour market this morning, the market for each month continued to show a bullish trend. Although the price of foreign wheat from Chicago was down by about four or five jiao, Canadian wheat remained unchanged. However, market sentiment was naturally good as factories were actively purchasing near-term flour. Furthermore, the Taizihdao group had some spot flour transactions, which further boosted confidence. This month's price had risen as high as 1 jiao 6 fen, and February also showed a slight increase of nearly 1 fen. However, the Tianjin group continued to sell, so the remaining months remained flat. Until the afternoon opening, due to rumors of factories selling back, this month's prices also saw some selling. The Tianjin group's persistent selling caused market sentiment to decline step by step. (It is said that the spot price in Tianjin is only 2 yuan 2 jiao 5 or 6 fen), and the decline was quite significant. As a result, this month's price fell by a small 5 li, February fell by 1 fen, March fell by 1 fen 2.5 li, April fell by 1 fen, and May and June fell by 1.5 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market remained generally stable in the morning and afternoon. Although the price of foreign wheat was reported to be down by a small 4 or 5 jiao, there were very few sellers in the market. Outsiders rarely inquired, and those in the trade mostly remained cautious, so transactions were unusually quiet. However, this situation may only see a turnaround after the spring. As a result, February was up by 3 fen, March was up by 1 fen, June was up by 2 fen, and there were no other changes. Spot wheat is scarce in both sales and arrivals, and inventories are also low. Holders are very firm in their thinking, and high-grade wheat is quoted at over 4 yuan 1 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Large Arrivals of Thick Japonica Rice, Continued Decline of a Few Jiao <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, sources from various groups arrived again, totaling about 7,000+ shih of thick japonica and various colored 50-grade rice, and 4-5,000+ shih of late indica 30-grade. Due to the market price already showing a bottoming-out, Hakka merchants intending to purchase the late indica rice were quite enthusiastic at the start of the market, and sellers successively tightened their prices. However, contrary to expectations, the Hakka merchants held different views, resulting in only 4,000+ packages being purchased from groups such as Tanggu, Tianjin, and Weihaiwei. Due to strict inventory clearance, the market price was difficult to rise, remaining in a stable situation. Considering the above, its trend may not be optimistic. The supply of thick japonica and Dujian foreign rice still exceeds demand, lacking the ability to turn around. The market price ultimately fell again by several fen to a jiao or so, and the demand for change dollar was firm.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 64-65 ships arrived from various groups downstream. Sales of various goods in the market were weak. High-grade white japonica and Baiyuan rice were down by a small amount, and medium-grade prices were down by a small jiao. Yangdu and Bujian rice were down by 5 fen. Early thin indica rice also showed a weakening trend, and Hakka merchants were firmly positioned.</p>

<p>|| Hakka Xian Rice Restocked by Quanzhou||</p>
<p>Yesterday's Hakka Xian rice market was originally expected to decline slightly. Because the prices in this street were relatively reasonable, purchases continued. The Min province side [Fujian] still did not restock due to the unstable political situation, but the Quanzhou group inquired about it while the prices were low. Market sentiment stabilized slightly, and market prices also stabilized. In the future, if the appetites of the Hakka merchants are strong again, the market may turn around. Because the current inventory and arrivals are both low, once the major groups purchase actively, the market can recover immediately. The total sales for the day included 100 packages of Hunan machine-processed oil rice at 7 yuan 2 jiao 7 fen, 300 packages of Pijing rice at 5 yuan 8 jiao 7 fen to 5 yuan 8 jiao, and 287 packages of Nanjing factory machine-processed Xian rice. The Beijing Xian rice was purchased by the Quanzhou group, and the rest were purchased by this street. This year's rice harvest was abundant, especially glutinous rice. Most of the glutinous rice goes to consumption in the production of wine, industry, tea shops, and Cifan vendors, etc., and is not as essential to daily life as japonica and indica rice. In recent years, the political situation and economy have deteriorated, and consumption has naturally decreased, so the price of Yuan rice has declined and is lower than the price of japonica rice. Recently, in addition to arrivals from downstream, Hakka Yuan rice arriving in Shanghai is also plentiful. The other day, 800+ packages of newly arrived Jiangxi second-grade machine-processed Yuan rice attracted little attention. Yesterday, this street purchased 53 packages, reduced to 6 yuan 5 jiao, 2 jiao 5 fen lower than the previous market price and half a yuan lower than last month. The selling price of high-grade Hakka Yuan rice remained high. Yesterday, Yutai allocated 30 packages of Hunan high-grade machine-processed Yuan rice to rice shops in this street at a price of 7 or 8 yuan 8 jiao, but the sales channels are different, and the selling price ultimately refuses to go down.</p>

<p>Yesterday, soybean sales were quite active. Factories purchased 11-12 truckloads, inland truckers purchased 3-4 truckloads, and this street purchased 3 truckloads.</p>
<p>Exports to Ningbo and Fuzhou need to purchase 2-300 packages, and the price is slightly up by 3-4 fen compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3 id="e288">Chaoqing Shantou Telegram Up 2 Jiao <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market suddenly turned flat and weak. The association's marked price for 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods actually broke into the 19 yuan mark, with a small transaction at 18 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen, down 5 fen from the previous day. Transshipment goods were 6 yuan 3 jiao, also down 5 fen. Dutch Red No. 9 was 15 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen, second-grade was 15 yuan 1 jiao. Taikoo sugar was down half a jiao, B mark was 19 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen, CW mark was 19 yuan 5 jiao, DY mark was 19 yuan 2 jiao, HX mark was 19 yuan. Zhenji No. 1 cotton white was 18 yuan, No. 2 was 17 yuan 8 jiao, No. 3 was 6 jiao, No. 4 was 4 jiao, all down half a jiao. Chaoqing's trend turned stable with a Shantou telegram reporting an increase of 2 jiao, with thousands of packages opened at a price of 12 yuan 2 jiao to 12 yuan, second-grade at 11 yuan 8 jiao to 5 jiao, and the lowest at 11 yuan. Several dozen packages of new cotton red were opened at a price of 15 yuan. Over a thousand boxes of sliced green were opened again, with the Chao group opening at 8 yuan 3 jiao and the Guang group opening at 8 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3 id="e289">Hankou Tung Oil Rises and Then Falls Back <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>Recently, white tung oil has seen a continued rise due to active sales by foreign firms in Hankou, rising from 23 yuan to 24 yuan 5 jiao. However, after the price increase, foreign firms stationed in Hankou adopted a wait-and-see attitude, so the transaction volume decreased. Each time the market opened, only 20-30 tons were traded, indicating that the foreign firms' minds were not settled and the Hankou traders' desires were not satisfied, wanting to take the opportunity to add 25 yuan. As detailed in the previous day's Hankou letter, there was a trend of opening at 25 yuan, but in reality, it did not open. However, yesterday's letter suddenly deteriorated, and the Hankou traders expressed a willingness to sell to foreign firms at 24 yuan. Although there was no transaction, the sharp turnaround in market conditions is undeniable. According to information from the Sichuan and Hunan routes, arrivals will be strong, and it is said that many goods are being shipped out. Hankou is a central gathering place, and when they all arrive, the quantity will be considerable. The other day, Hankou traders purchased Xiang Tung oil at 19 yuan 5 jiao and South Branch including tax at 19 yuan 3 or 4 jiao, all custom orders, totaling 2-3,000 dan. Judging from the current market, this price may be stable, but it still depends on the prosperity of foreign sales. As for Zhejiang tung oil, in the past few days, seeing a turnaround in the Hankou market, the market also echoed, increasing from 19 yuan 7 or 8 jiao for delivery in Shanghai to 20 yuan 078 jiao. Hangzhou traders sold in Shanghai, also in the range of 2-3,000 dan. Therefore, the recent inventory of each oil and hemp shop is no longer as thin as it was a week ago, and it is evident that the market has turned from rising to loosening, and all have a trend of ending purchases. Furthermore, arrivals in Hangzhou have continued to be strong recently, as various producing areas in eastern Zhejiang, seeing the market price rise, all want to sell and are rushing to transport goods to Hangzhou to try to sell quickly. The provincial capital is the commercial center of Zhejiang, so it is appropriate that the sources are increasing daily.</p>

<h3 id="e290">The Price of Pure Antimony Continues to Decline <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Hunan pure antimony has been sluggish due to the cold business of foreign firms and the scarce demand from local mints and arsenals in various ports. However, arrivals have been very strong, resulting in extremely thick accumulation, extremely soft sentiment, and a weak market. Therefore, market prices are gradually loosening, and the overall market situation is also showing a downward trend. The recent estimated price is 300 yuan per ton, down another 5 yuan from before. It is said that for large-volume transactions and continuous dumping, the market price may be even lower.</p>
<p>Silk Market</p>
<h3 id="e291">Reduced Consumption of Raw Silk in Europe and America <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>The prosperous sales of high-grade Chefoo spun silk produced in Zhejiang and Huguang, which used to be sold through the U.S., have plummeted ever since Japanese silk has been competing at low prices in the U.S. and rayon has been dumped on the market. Last winter, U.S. firms did not purchase any dry spun or big spun silk, and there have been no shipments to the U.S. in the past month. From this, it can be seen that Chefoo spun silk is almost extinct in the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Difficult Turnaround in European and American Silk Sales Most of the European and American silk weaving industries suffered losses last year, and inventories piled up with no one inquiring. This year, they are all focusing on tightening policies, reducing production, and reducing raw silk consumption. The silk inventories in New York and Lyon are still thick, and factory sales are stagnant. Telegrams from thread mills are not converting, and the market in Shanghai is sluggish. Yesterday, only Indian firms purchased 15 packages of coarse yellow and white silk, and prices remained flat and weak.</p>

<h3 id="e314">On Change <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yang</p>
<p>D. Vries believes that the variation of organisms can be divided into two types: one is "hesitant variation" and the other is "sudden variation." The former does not transmit its characteristics to its descendants, so it is not related to the evolution of organisms. The evolution of organisms depends entirely on "sudden string variation" because this is what transmits characteristics to descendants. This theory has been proven by other biologists to be not entirely correct. The so-called "hesitant variation" and "sudden variation" are actually the same thing with only differences in degree.</p>
<p>But no matter how you say it, organisms are always changing, and whether it is hesitant variation or sudden variation, changing back and forth, they will never change back to their old appearance.</p>
<p>This is very different from the transformations of monsters.</p>
<p>Gods and monsters can all transform. For example, the monkey spirit Sun Wukong is incredibly powerful and can transform endlessly. He can transform into various human forms, insects, bottles, clear wind, etc. However, all transformations are temporary, and afterward, he must return to his original form. Moreover, he suffers from having a very cumbersome tail. Once, when he and Erlang Shen fought and transformed into temples, because he had no place to put his tail, he turned it into a flagpole, but it could only be erected behind the temple, revealing the flaw. Similarly, the White Snake in the Legend of the White Snake, even though she transforms into a woman for a long time, when she gets drunk, she cannot control herself and must reveal her original form, even scaring her lover.</p>
<p>These types of transformations can be said to be diverse sudden variations, but the result is actually the same as no change. This is exactly the same as the transformations of certain humans.</p>
<p>Local tyrants and evil gentry can become ultra-left socialists, corrupt warlords can become revolutionary heroes, actors can become doctors of literature. Among humans, unexpected transformations are particularly numerous, but no matter how they change, how can they shed their original form? Liu Guitang transformed fifty-one times in thirty-three years, but wasn't he still a bandit?</p>
<p>Even in temporary transformations, Sun Wukong felt ashamed when he had to transform into a lewd and cheap bird. This kind of psychology is something humans lack. If necessary, humans are willing to transform into anything, no matter how base or vile.</p>
<p>Transformation is not always evolution; evolution is limited to transformation that does not return to its original form.</p>
<h3 id="e315">Life <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Xunyu</p>
<p>It seems that there are two attitudes towards life, and it also seems that there are only these two; the best examples are begging and kidnapping.</p>
<p>In the alley where I live, there are two "regular customers" called beggars who come twice a day, at noon and in the evening. Although they are called beggars, they don't beg or ask for alms. Each time they just stand in the alley for seven or eight minutes. When the maids bring out the leftovers, they go up to them, take the food, pour it into their buckets, and quietly wait while eating for the second maid to bring out the leftovers. They always eat their fill and take half a bucket of leftovers back with them. After my meal, I habitually go out to collect the meal money for the next few days, so I always see them twice a day. Every time I walk from the alley entrance to the bus stop, I always wonder, why do they still want to live? People have the courage to live entirely because they are tempted by "hope." Eating leftovers every day without the slightest intention of improving their lives, what "hope" is still tempting them? They want to live, I cannot solve this question, so I think of myself. Although I don't stand in the alley twice a day, I also go to a certain place twice a day. Although I don't carry a small tin bucket to receive leftovers, I also carry a wallet to hold "wages." How much difference is there in essence between wages and leftovers? Why do I still want to live? What "hope" is there that is more tempting than theirs? Thinking of this, I can't help but laugh, and I come to a conclusion that "greed for life" and "fear of death" are actually caused by the latter.</p>
<p>But it doesn't seem to be entirely true; those who hold the second attitude towards life are the opposite proof. They risk death to seek life; if they can get through it, they live; if they can't, they die. It seems that the air of fearing death is less than greed for life in them. Perhaps there is something wrong with saying it this way; greed for life and fear of death are just two sides of the same coin. But they want to live happily; otherwise, they would rather die; this is the characteristic.</p>
<p>One is to eke out a living while waiting for death, the other is to risk death to seek life; which one is right? It is difficult to say, but the latter is always more lively. Unfortunately, I myself am very rich in the temperament of a beggar. I often just lie in bed, looking up at the ceiling, waiting for some fairy's maid in the sky to pour down leftovers. Half of my life history is also cold as ice.</p>
<h3 id="e316">Conditioned Response <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Huanming</p>
<p>On a drizzly night, I fear hearing calls coming from afar.</p>
<p>If in the fine rain threads that lightly pat the window, someone is shouting in the darkness, I will become uneasy. If this kind of sound is closer, my feelings are less; the further away, the more the calls heard by pricking up my ears and holding my breath make me feel lost.</p>
<p>This is probably what is called a "conditioned response" in psychology.</p>
<p>Every time I encounter this kind of sound, the disheveled appearance of Wu Fu's wife vaguely appears before my eyes.</p>
<p>That was the winter after the flood; Wu Fu's wife's thatched shack had been soaked by the flood to the point of collapse.</p>
<p>"Wu Fu's wife, well, you should repair your thatched shack. If a big wind comes, you might not be able to live in it."</p>
<p>Wu Fu's wife was sitting on a "straw sandal stool" at the slanted doorway, making straw sandals. She hesitated slightly: "Well, it's not a big problem, it's still okay, I plan to repair it next year. I think I can support it for another year or so, right? What do you say, Uncle X!"</p>
<p>People not only have a good impression of her words but also of her in all aspects.</p>
<p>"There are not a few who want to pick up this 'worn-out straw sandal' (note) - she really has integrity. If a widow like her had been in a wealthy family in the former Qing Dynasty, the Emperor would definitely erect a memorial arch for her!"</p>
<p>Among the women, the praise for Wu Fu's wife is different. No matter what, a woman is unwilling or inconvenient to praise another woman's chastity, but everyone is convinced of Wu Fu's wife's "willingness to work." When things get "busy," or when someone throws a feast, they always can't do without calling Wu Fu's wife to help. She is agile and doesn't talk too much. In addition, there is another thing that everyone praises: she doesn't haggle over wages. It's okay if she helps for a day and gets a hundred cash less; even if they give her a little rice, she accepts it with a smile. She is not greedy and is generous and not annoying at all.</p>
<p>However, there is also one thing that makes people feel slightly regretful: every time she comes to help, Wu Fu's wife always has to bring her six-year-old posthumous daughter with her. Although the daughter is well-behaved, people generally think that it is adding another mouth to feed.</p>
<p>However, for her, everything else seems secondary; she must have her daughter by her side.</p>
<p>That winter, someone in the village said that Wu Fu's wife owed Jin Tudi, the big landowner, a large debt. Everyone who heard this was a little lost in Wu Fu's wife, but she calmly argued: "I'm a widow, where would I get that? There's no such thing. I can still work to eat, you see; my clothes were made for me by him six years ago - I don't add any clothes, I should be able to make ends meet with a pair of hands - there's no such thing!" She thought this was a terrible rumor.</p>
<p>However, the matter ultimately couldn't be hidden for long: someone had already seen Jin Tudi's accountant frequenting her home several times.</p>
<p>"If she doesn't owe Jin Tudi's debt, then she must be the one who stole from his accounting room. Hmph, who says it isn't? Is it really that hard to make a living with a pair of hands to feed two mouths?" The "fast-mouthed woman," Widow Yu Gui, sneered.</p>
<p>The public's opinion of Wu Fu's wife was gradually not as good as before. Some people thought that since she owed debt, she would inevitably have to steal. Several families who had called her to help began to have some women check their homes to see if she had taken anything. Although they didn't find anything missing, they had heavily added a bit of distrust towards her. The "fast-mouthed woman" said that she had seen Wu Fu's wife standing at the meat shop in the city. Men, however, thought that Wu Fu's wife should not have borrowed money from Jin Tudi, that King Yama.</p>
<p>In the evening, Wu Fu's wife crept into my house like a shadow. Her face was pale, and her voice was trembling: "Auntie, I - can you lend me some money? Ten yuan, preferably twenty or thirty yuan..."</p>
<p>She finally admitted that she had borrowed Jin Tudi's debt. "Auntie," she said, "it's hard to explain, I borrowed it six years ago. I borrowed it after he died to pay for the funeral. At the time, it was only five yuan, but now, with principal and interest," "- it's thirty-six yuan and eighty cents!" She took another step forward, her pupils gleaming: "Thirty-six yuan and eighty cents - if I don't pay it back, his accountant said they'll take my little Zhen as collateral! You... can you help me out a little..."</p>
<p>My mother's answer made her eyes fall: her face reddened, and she stammered: "...Then, please don't tell anyone else!" She walked out step by step: "You can't even help me with five yuan?..."</p>
<p>"Five yuan!" She turned her pleading eyes back a second time, gesturing.</p>
<p>No one had ever seen Wu Fu's wife look so begging.</p>
<p>Several days later, on a drizzly night, someone was shouting sharply and sadly from afar, it was Wu Fu's wife: she was full of tears, sweat, and rain, her hair was disheveled, her pupils were dilated, her face was blue, or perhaps it could be said to be blue-gray. She pulled up her torn front of her garment and wiped the water off her face: "Oh, I worked so hard just for this little darling, oh, she's gone, hehe, I know - I know, Zhen's father, I know!" She walked away muttering to herself.</p>
<p>"Ah Zhen, ai, where are you? Come back soon..." As she disappeared into the darkness, she shouted with her sad and high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>I stared blankly, at the dim and about-to-die vegetable oil lamp, in the distance: on the other side of the dark drizzle, mixed with the sound of rain, and two or three dogs barking, her call came intermittently, so far away, but so clear, my heart seemed about to sink.</p>
<p>(Note) "Worn-out straw sandal": Marrying a poor widow is called picking up a worn-out straw sandal.</p>
<h3 id="e317">Amusing Analogies (Continued) <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>Let me copy a few more sentences from Xu Qi's writings. In his "Three Letters from Leyuan," he wrote: "Villagers invite guests, piling up fruit and boxes, all the same from every household, knowing what they will bring before they even bring it. Thus, literary quality declines daily, inevitably disgusting those in the know, unlike mixed sand, which, though rough, at least doesn't stink." His amusing analogy is very apt, and it aligns perfectly with my own views. I would rather praise "mixed sand" than flatter those easily "stinking" writings, even if the old master once flaunted his skills and frequently shook his head at my words.</p>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>Ji Dong said, "A few years ago, during the spring in the capital, a certain Mr. Lou Dong wrote a detailed critique of Elder Yushan, nitpicking and leaving no stone unturned. Dong Xu told a guest, 'I came from Shandong and once traveled to Mount Tai, ascending the Peak of Sunrise Viewing. While feeling awestruck, I suddenly had an urgent need to urinate. Descending would take ten li, which was unbearable, so I secretly relieved myself at the side of the peak, fearing severe punishment, but I was fine. Why? The mountain is so vast and high, and many people urinate there; Mount Tai doesn't even notice.' The guest jumped up and cursed loudly. However, yesterday I heard Mr. Wu Meicun praising Dong's words highly." This kind of amusing analogy to scold people truly makes one not know whether to laugh or cry. Among modern writers, only Mr. Lu Xun can reach this level.</p>
<p>(10)</p>
<p>Jiang Fen said, "Although contemporary people's selections of poetry are poor, there are still things worth picking. A lotus flower grows out of foul mud; just pick the lotus flower and leave the foul mud." Looking at the current literary scene, it is truly more foul mud than lotus flowers. We should also select magazines and articles in this way.</p>
<p>(10) (1)</p>
<p>Deng Hanyi criticized those who imitate ancient writers, saying, "Their words are neither modern nor ancient, and their spirit is half-alive, half-dead." The former statement is ordinary, but the latter cannot but make people slap the table and exclaim in admiration. Those who blindly imitate are actually "half-alive, half-dead" in spirit, but unfortunately, no one can express it like Hanyi.</p>
<p>(10) (2)</p>
<p>Zhou Qi told his colleague, "During the Jiayou reign of the Song Dynasty, there were no restrictions on visits, and scholars often rushed to seek favors. One person was known as the 'Fire-Watching Horse,' and another as the 'Day-Traveling God,' meaning they spent their days rushing around. Alas! Now, we must use the 'Day-Traveling God' to also ride the 'Fire-Watching Horse,' what is to be done?" The two amusing analogies are cleverly linked.</p>
<h3 id="e318">Two Brothers (84) <a href="#e318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>"But surely you won't deceive me, will you?"</p>
<p>Pierre felt so moved that he almost wanted to embrace and kiss him:</p>
<p>"But I am not deceiving you. I can't find a foothold here at all. I'm going to leave this place as a doctor on a transatlantic mail ship."</p>
<p>"Ah! Mr. Pierre! You once promised to help me live!"</p>
<p>"What can I do? I have to live myself. I don't have a penny to my name."</p>
<p>Marosko repeated:</p>
<p>"This is not good, this is not good, what you are doing. I, I only have starvation ahead of me. At my age, this is the end. This is not good. You abandon a poor old man who came to rely on you. This is not good."</p>
<p>Pierre wanted to explain, defend himself, to reason, to prove that he had no choice; but the Pole would not listen to him at all, he was only indignant at his betrayal, and in the end, he even said those words that undoubtedly hinted at some political events:</p>
<p>"You French, you are not trustworthy."</p>
<p>Then Pierre stood up, this time he was somewhat indignant, and he said to him in a slightly haughty tone:</p>
<p>"Old man Marosko, you are being unreasonable. It takes a strong motivation for someone to decide to do something like I've decided to do; you should understand that. Goodbye then. I hope when I see you again, you will be more reasonable than you are now."</p>
<p>Then he walked out.</p>
<p>"So no one feels a real regret about my leaving the country," he thought to himself.</p>
<p>He searched his mind, he thought of everyone he knew or had ever known, and in the parade of faces passing through his memory, he found the face of the barmaid in the beer hall that made him suspicious of his mother.</p>
<p>He hesitated, he still held an instinctive hatred for her, then, he suddenly decided, he thought, "In any case, she guessed right." So he made his way to the beer hall.</p>
<p>The beer hall happened to be full of customers and smoke. Because it was a holiday, the drinkers—both middle class and workers—were shouting, laughing, and yelling, even the owner himself was serving customers, running from table to table, taking away empty glasses, and bringing back full glasses of foam.</p>
<p>As Pierre found a seat near the counter, he waited, hoping the barmaid would see him and recognize him.</p>
<p>But she ran back and forth in front of him, without looking at him once, her legs wiggling prettily under her short skirt as she hurried.</p>
<p>Finally, he tapped the table with a coin. She came running:</p>
<p>"What do you want, sir?"</p>
<p>Her eyes did not look at him, she was focused on calculating the bills of the customers she was serving.</p>
<p>"What!" he said, "Is this how you greet old friends?"</p>
<p>She glanced at him and said in a hurried voice:</p>
<p>"Ah! It's you. Hello. But I don't have time to chat with you today. Do you want a beer?"</p>
<p>"Yes, a beer."</p>

<h3 id="e319">A Writer's Lament <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Originally, the term "writer" seemed to be a more elegant name that people used to call those who peddled their writing skills. It was as if, once someone entered the ranks of writers, they became a remarkable, romantic talent. Therefore, I am quite unsuitable to call myself a writer. However, since I am ultimately someone who sells articles, I might as well pretend to be one. Writers have many hardships, and this is a common sentiment among those in the same profession. Therefore, I might as well lament a bit. – The above is considered an introduction to the topic.</p>
<p>However, a writer's hardships are truly endless and inexhaustible. And if I were to imitate the tone of a woman, where should I even begin?</p>
<p>Under the current social system, everything has become a commodity. Prostitutes sell their bodies, actors sell their voices, socialites sell their love, and writers sell their writing to make a living. Since it is selling, there must be customers, which is an unchanging truth. Therefore, to attract customers, there must be various goods to meet their needs. For example, if a customer wants flirtatious behavior, then a prostitute must try her best to appear charming and lovely. If theatergoers like to see Pan Jinlian teasing Wu Song, then it is not enough for the actor to only know how to perform Baochan serving wine. If rich and powerful patrons want socialites to dance naked for them, then it is not enough for the socialites to only be willing to accompany them to see movies of people bathing and taking off their pants. So, what if noble readers want to read romance novels about nephews loving their aunts, and writers only give them works like "The True Story of Ah Q"? If you are not good at having everything available and fulfilling every request, then you can only tighten your belt and wait to die.</p>
<p>However, it is not easy for a writer to transform into a department store. Some publications want humor, some want Saturday School or Butterfly-Mandarin Duck fiction, some want to be non-reactionary, and some want to be improperly reactionary. Therefore, it is truly impossible for a writer to cater to the needs of various markets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, humor and Saturday School fiction still focus on form, while being improperly reactionary or non-reactionary are the most difficult problems for writers to solve.</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone inevitably has their own thoughts, and writers are even more sensitive people. It is impossible to write without emotion. But in these times, a writer's thoughts, other than being "Chinese style" and "qualified," are mostly hidden within the words. I am unfortunate enough to be a writer, and I am also naturally headstrong and unwilling to "follow the instructions." Therefore, I can only lament to myself late at night and hope that you all do not view it as a prostitute's lament.</p>

<h3 id="e320">The Front, Back, and Side of Life <a href="#e320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— Veteran</p>
<p>Being a person is already difficult, and being a modern person is especially difficult.</p>
<p>However, this is only true for a certain group of people who are serious about everything. In the vast universe, if we truly calculate, intelligent people are in the majority. In the eyes of most intelligent people, being a person is not very difficult, but rather quite convenient. This is because they are very intelligent and can thoroughly understand life. Therefore, every morning when they open the door, they can smoothly deal with everything. As for fools, they must consider this and consider that, what is justice, what is truth, what is reason, what is emotion. Naturally, they will run into walls and be unable to open up a path to life. Therefore, they say being a person is difficult. In reality, the difficulty lies in being foolish, being ignorant of the ways of the world. In more fashionable terms, it is not understanding the trend of reality. Being ignorant of the ways of the world and not understanding the trend is something even village women can understand clearly. Your life should be placed outside the circle. Pinch your nose and go cry. In this vast world, who will pity you?</p>
<p>However, what kind of intelligence do intelligent people actually have? It is not that they truly have some extraordinary intelligence, but simply that they have seen through life. In other words, they have achieved understanding the ways of the world and understanding the trend. The major premise is to grasp "fame" and "profit," and their eyes are fixed on "enjoyment." If they do this, they can be successful in everything and become a prominent figure of the era.</p>
<p>Here, we must bring out three typical ways of being a person: the front, the back, and the side.</p>
<p>The front should logically refer to the bright side, but here it is not. It refers to the side that a person shows to those in higher positions, or at least to those who are slightly better. For example, above a director is a minister, the minister's wife, a deputy minister, the deputy minister's wife. This, the side that the director shows to these people, is what I mean by the front. In fact, the meaning is not so narrow. In short, it is the behavior in front of people of higher status, reputation, and power, that is the front. Here, the first thing you need is a smiling, amiable, and friendly face. Speaking is very simple, just keep responding with "yes, yes, yes." If you also have some ideas you want to express, then at least be sincerely terrified, and that is almost enough. There is no need to elaborate on other things. For example, being as loyal as a tail-wagging guard dog, and flattering loudly, are also necessary conditions, but many have already said so, and the meaning is already clear, so there is no need to repeat it.</p>
<p>Speaking of the back, it has actually been subtly hinted at above. It refers to people of lower status than oneself, such as a master treating a servant, a madam treating a maid, a section chief treating a section member, a director treating subordinates, and so on. Here, you must change the sincere terror into being both respected and strict. Middle-aged people in their twenties and thirties may as well twist their beards and keep a little bit. When sitting, cough dryly two or three times from time to time, and then use the index fingers of both hands to touch the two mustaches. There is no need to elaborate on the meaning, just make the gestures and roll your eyes a few times is enough. If that's not enough, you can say, "Why are you so clueless?" This then leads to "blowing."</p>
<p>Under the dignified, Buddha-like mask, you can close your eyes and just blow, and that will be enough. However, you must be careful not to lightly reveal a penny of the secrets and inside stories, otherwise that would be truly terrible. If the other party chuckles, that would not be fun at all.</p>
<p>The side is between the front and the back, and refers to how to treat people of equal status. You cannot completely apply the treasures of the front, nor can you blindly imitate the full set of the back. However, both can be used for reference, and it is good to use them effectively. For example, if the other party is meeting for the first time, then you must give them a good impression. Your face should be kind and friendly, and you can blow at any time. If they are old friends, then you don't need to, but you should be silent as a cicada in winter. You can open up a dignified face without being too restrained or too dissipated. You must make the other party have a good impression of you. The most taboo here is the misuse of the pure front, which often annoys friends and breaks ties with you.</p>
<h3 id="e321">Night Walk in Jiangwan <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— Yiming</p>
<p>Jiangwan, this land that has been baptized by the artillery fire of imperialism, I have not come to pay my respects for a long time. Tonight, at the invitation of a friend from Fudan University, I went to see the 15th performance of the Fudan Drama Society. So, after eating dinner, I quickly took a car to visit.</p>
<p>It was not until eight o'clock that the opening was announced.</p>
<p>First came the one-act play "The Boor" by the Russian writer Chekhov. This is a comedy of love, and it is very good in terms of technique, but it is backward in terms of consciousness. In tonight's performance by the society, the technique was also not very good. The two important roles, Elena Popova and Grigory Smirnov, were both performed unsuccessfully. Especially Ms. Wang Caizhi, who played Elena Popova, felt even more stiff, although she had the posture of a widow. Bao Shijun, who played the servant Luka, was very good. As for the effects, the electric bell was not realistic enough.</p>
<p>Next was Ding Xilin's "Oppression." The content of this play really did not show oppression, it was just a coincidence. The effect on stage tonight was still good, partly due to the harmony of the actors and partly due to the success of the technique. The female tenant in this play was played by Ms. Wang Ying. Although Ms. Wang did not perform very well, her experience was a little richer than others. The male tenant was played by Wu Tieyi, who played Grigory Smirnov in "The Boor." His performance in this play was better than in the first play. The worst was the old woman, whose makeup, movements, and speech were all bad. This was perhaps due to the director's inattention.</p>
<p>The third play was "Moonrise." This script has been performed many times in Shanghai. The content is still a little interesting, but it is also too old. Tonight's performance was half a failure. First, Li Zhonglin, who played the role of Person One, failed in his performance because he used the same speech and movements for an old man as for a strong young man. Gu Degang, who played the sheriff, performed passably. The other two policemen also did not have any problems. Second, the effects and lighting failed. The lighting was too bright and too dark, which the stage conditions did not allow. Tonight, they made this mistake. The effect of the boat moving in the water was not well done. Only the speech of the people in the play was seen, but the audience did not know what the boat was doing.</p>
<p>The last play was "John Manly." The content of this play depicts a sailor who went missing. His lover had to marry an old man because of poverty at home. After this woman got married, she could never forget her former lover. Every day, she would smile and sing a song from the heart. As a result, she decided not to think about her former lover (thinking he was dead) and told all her secrets to her husband. But, after she told her husband, she could not forget her former lover again after hearing the roar of the sea. She cried sadly. At this moment, her lover (the sailor) suddenly returned. However, she firmly refused to be with her lover again. Finally, the sailor left sadly. This is a tragic drama of love, and there is not much consciousness. In the performance, Ms. Wang Ying was successful in playing the heroine Therese. Bao Shijun's performance as Zoer was also not bad. The worst was Li Zhonglin, who played John Manly. He made the big mistakes of stage fright and unnaturalness.</p>
<p>After watching these four plays, it was already past eleven o'clock. Under the darkness, I left Jiangwan, where the ruins of the fortress still remained, and returned to the embrace of the metropolis.</p>

<p>— Shiben</p>
<p>A slogan for opening up a new life!</p>
<p>When the New Year arrives, everyone must cheer up, thinking that as the years are renewed, our human affairs should also be renewed. Therefore, everyone is busy reviewing the past and determining the future. If you think of something you did that was not right in the process, you should renew it this year. Then, there is the swearing of "All things of the past are as if they died yesterday, and all things of the future are as if they were born today" as a sign of resolute determination. For example, a friend of mine likes smoking and gambling. In the New Year, he thought of all the harms of smoking and gambling, so he wanted to change his ways from this year onwards, and swore not to smoke or gamble. However, time passed, and not long after, he was gambling and smoking again. People asked him why his New Year's vows were not working. He would definitely say that this year was awkward because he had smoked once and gambled once during the New Year celebrations, so he had already broken his vow. He would wait until next year to make sure he didn't smoke or gamble. So, next New Year, he would have another "All things of the past are as if they died yesterday, and all things of the future are as if they were born today" swearing. Like this, wasting away year after year, procrastinating, and self-deceiving, there are many, many in society! Hoping for a better next year this year, but next year is still a mess! This is the result of everyone embracing the idea of muddling through and not having the awakening of self-renewal.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that a person either does not sincerely change their ways, or if they really want to sincerely change their past mistakes, do not have any reservations. It is not necessary to resolve to change from the New Year onwards. You can change at any time, as long as you realize your mistakes, change immediately, without hesitating or wavering from X time onwards or from X day onwards. Because "Time flies and never returns," and "An inch of time is hard to buy with an inch of gold." How can we allow ourselves to waste away the valuable youth in the subconscious of "hesitation" and "wavering"!</p>
<p>"If you want to change, change immediately" is the slogan for opening up a new life that I advocate! Friends! If you are an awakened one who wants to "turn over a new leaf," you don't need to hesitate. Start practicing it today!</p>
<p>In fact, "The Times" does not allow us to hesitate! Written on January 6, 1934.</p>
<h3 id="e323">Please Take Tonics! <a href="#e323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>— Yiqin</p>
<p>Some people diagnose China's ailments and say it is suffering from "collapse." It is appropriate to take tonics for collapse, and this does not even require the title of "Doctor of Medicine" to know. However, although some people are trying their best to inject German-made morphine, it is still ineffective. And now, tonics from Japan have arrived again.</p>
<p>According to this newspaper's report on November 23, recently, due to the lull in our country's boycott movement, Japanese merchants are taking advantage of the opportunity to import inferior goods in large quantities. Recently, a large batch of inferior ginseng has arrived, intending to peddle it to various ginseng and medicine stores in this city. However, because the medicine stores are wary of the precedent of Shen Feng and other eight rice firms selling Japanese rice, they are all taking a wait-and-see attitude and dare not openly sell it.</p>
<p>Heaven pities China, which has suffered from years of floods, droughts, and wars. The countryside is barren, and the people are already unable to make a living. Fortunately, we have already eaten American wheat and received Japanese rice. Now, we are also given tonics. How can we not come back to life!</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the Japanese is to be only grateful for. They are "suppressing bandits" for us in Rehe, and helping to resolve Feng Yuxiang's troops in Chahar. This is considered surgical treatment. Seizing our four northeastern provinces is considered a "package cure." The January 28th Incident gave the people of Shanghai and even the whole country a dose of iron and blood, and it was also a small cut for the Nineteenth Route Army, which would later become "rebels." Now, we need to take tonics. I think that although the medicine stores are still "taking a wait-and-see attitude," "to refuse repeatedly is to be disrespectful." In the end, they will still accept the order like Japanese rice. It's just that "courtesy demands reciprocity, what do we have to repay them with?"</p>

<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Life is inherently depressing and boring. But you have to rely on yourself to work hard and strive, recognize the goal, and determine the direction to work hard and strive! Only then can you find bright and great comfort. But I have gone through so many struggles, and the result is still the same disappointment and sadness!</p>
<p>For the sake of pursuing life, I shamelessly went to various places to seek help and beg for assistance. However, I was met with obstacles everywhere, and in the end, I only received a few contemptuous glances! I was finally surrounded by poverty and sorrow! Alas! Heaven! Why is my fate so bad? My destiny is full of twists and turns; what I encounter is always wrong. The old wounds have not yet healed, and new stimuli come again. Unfortunate me, I encounter unfortunate events everywhere. Thus, a layer of sorrow is heavily covered on my blurred nerves! A painful wound is deeply etched on my weak heart! That unfortunate tragedy attacks my heart again. The terrifying scene is forever indelibly emerging in my brain membrane. Let me suffer all the pain of life, let me taste all the torment of life! Ah! Life! I can only complain here, complaining about everything that has passed:</p>
<p>Ten years of failure; Several years of wandering. Only then do I know how difficult it is to be a person, why bother falling into the mortal world! The present is still like the past; From beginning to end. Fish leap, disliking the sea's narrowness, Birds fly, hating the sky's emptiness. Lodging is like morning dew; Living in the world is like a spring dream! How many lost travelers, Cannot escape a life of failure in the end, Only for the sake of current plans; Walking and wading, harming my remaining body, I live on Mount Tiantai; Counting the falling red every day, If one day the golden lock breaks; A dragon runs out of the shallow abyss, Flying up to the sky; Pushing aside the heavy fog. Old hatreds and new sorrows, when can they end? Busy all day long, this floating life is truly like a dream. A beauty with a tragic fate! I am the poorest of all! Time passes in an instant, The seasons are too hurried, Laboring swallows fly apart; When will we meet again? Wasting time in vain; Embracing Sir Copper Coin in vain! I wish that in life after life, Heaven and earth would last forever, Flying away from the cage! I have tasted all the flavors of life; The bitterness, spiciness, and sourness are all in my heart. This is not beautiful singing; Nor is it a clear poem, I cannot write poetry; I don't know how to sing, I don't know how to fill in lyrics. Here are only the sorrowful sounds of me complaining to those who sympathize.</p>

<h3 id="e326">Will There Be Future Troubles? <a href="#e326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a 21-year-old youth. Last June, through the introduction of relatives and friends, I fell in love with Ms. Chen. Soon, she said, "I was once engaged to Mr. Qu; but both parties were unwilling to fulfill the engagement, and we mutually returned the rings and tokens, and a written cancellation of the engagement was signed." After checking the agreement, the tone was only a piece of draft paper prepared for publication in the newspaper, signed by both parties, with no witnesses' signatures. Her explanation to me here is "Because there were no witnesses at the time of the engagement, there were also no witnesses at the time of the cancellation of the engagement." Now, I suspect that Mr. Qu will not come to disrupt things after I am engaged to her, and are we violating the criminal law? Now I want to find Mr. Qu to sign a new contract, but I don't know where he is.</p>
<p>Because I want to avoid these many future troubles, what is a complete solution? Please teach me in detail. I wish</p>
<p>Your believer</p>
<p>Zhuo An, Lu Zhen</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Love is blind, regardless of benefits; If you and Ms. Chen have true love, it is better not to consider these many issues. Because once you find out that there are "future troubles," can you bear to cut her off? You must know that Mr. Qu's whereabouts are currently unknown, how can her future be settled? Those who can bear to cut off are definitely not true love, even if there are no future troubles, it is best not to proceed. As for the questions you asked, there is a solution. Ms. Chen should come forward and apply to the court in the place where the engagement took place, based on the reason that Mr. Qu's whereabouts are unknown, to declare the engagement invalid. That incomplete cancellation agreement can be submitted at the same time; because at least it can serve as an expression of the intentions of both parties!</p>

<p>— Wheels</p>
<p>My legs, I've had over ten injections to prevent numbness, and eaten about a hundred packets of medicine - two packets a day, over ten packets a week - but even now I still don't know what the disease is or what caused it. Although I have a sort of intuitive understanding, the doctors have never told me.</p>
<p>The longer it goes on, the more my fear increases, and I've lost all hope in the doctors' help!</p>
<p>My father sent tiger bone and papaya wine. I long for wine. There's not a drop of it here, and not a trace of its flavor in the food. It seems every nerve in my body is telling me to have it, every cell is parched, and if I have it every day, I seem to be guaranteed to get better! Wine, wine, wine, I lie awake savoring thoughts of it, and dream of it when I sleep.</p>
<p>When I was outside, I didn't feel that wine had these powers, and I didn't often drink it, nor did I feel any particular interest in it. But now it has this strange, mysterious allure for me! I still can't forget buying a hundred coins' worth of old wine, with half left over, and Zhu and I both drank it and got drunk, our faces red! Where does this current craving come from? It can't be wrong, it can cure my illness! My blood, which is becoming numb, blood which is circulating sluggishly, needs the stimulation of yellow wine! - But the real reason is that I am in this arid desert, and my throat has been parched for so long, that the thirst in my throat has become a thirst in my whole soul, my whole body. In my detailed imagination, I have built up the power of the wine, and this thirst has turned into a complete demand from me. A demand for wine.</p>
<p>The wine has arrived, it is for me, it is in response to my thirst, but in the first section - I must still submit a report to the second section, and only after it is approved can it be issued. A kind of interfering relationship has been inserted between my father and me. And this relationship has made me refuse.</p>
<p>Today, I continued to file a report, the content of which was roughly: "Although there are other medicines to treat the disease, they are ineffective. Although tiger bone and papaya wine is wine, it is medicine. The improved prison should have more good medicines in stock, and when prisoners have no choice but to buy them themselves, they should be issued."</p>
<p>Although this report has been submitted, I became terrified after submitting it. Because in my writing, I have completely refuted the head of the second section. Although the reason for refuting him is justified, at least we prisoners say it is justified. However, according to our experience, it is considered inappropriate to refute a superior with justified reasons, and one can only passively accept. But because I didn't have wine to drink, I wrote it out of a momentary emotional impulse. Oh legs, prepare yourselves for shackles tomorrow!</p>
