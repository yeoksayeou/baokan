<h3 id="c23">論禁止有獎儲蓄 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 謹</p>
<p>本月二十二日立法院修正通過儲蓄銀行法草案十七條內第十四條規定。「有獎儲蓄應禁止之。本法施行前已辦之有獎儲蓄存欵。其結束辦法。由財政部擬定呈請行政院核定之。」查有獎儲蓄。本爲識者多年所詬病。其所以延年至今日始爲政府明令取締者。原因有自非一端。今政府雖抱定實行禁止之决心。而默察前途。荊棘重重。難免不爲强有力者所阻礙。而致功虧一簣也。　　在我國境內經營有獎儲蓄者。當民國八九年之際。曾盛極一時。厥後黑幕揭穿。信用墮落。乃至紛紛倒閉。政府當局且從而懸爲厲禁。不意事過境遷。此風復張。年來中外金融機關。以辦理有獎儲蓄而收意外之利益者。往往有之。而正當儲蓄事業之發展率。反相見絀。（按我國創設儲蓄機關垂三十年。然民國二十一年度全國郵政儲金不過二千六百萬元。二十三家普通銀行儲金。亦僅二萬五千萬元。合計尙不逾三萬萬元。反觀日本。以七千萬之人口。而其一九三二年度之郵政儲金。乃逾二十八萬萬日圓。普通銀行儲金逾十七萬萬日圓。合計達四十五萬萬。我國與較。望塵莫及。）欲求正當儲蓄事業之發達。非取締有獎儲蓄不爲功。良以國民之資金有限。其用途支配。豐於此者。必嗇於彼也。目前專營有獎儲蓄之機關。除中國實業銀行儲蓄部。已停止開立新戶外。當推萬國儲蓄會爲巨擘。次之則爲中法儲蓄會。據聞萬國儲蓄會共有儲戶三四十萬人。每月收入現欵近二百萬元。每年凈增存欵二千萬元。現有儲金總額六千五百萬元。其力量之可驚。在上海金融事業中。實屬罕覯。以每月偌大之現欵。而供非本國人民之操縱利用。夫豈細故者哉。</p>
<p>有獎儲蓄之發達約如上述。考其所以發達之原因。則一外乎都巿游資之充斥。而一般儲戶。貪得獎金之心理。亦與有關係。查近年以來。國內農村經濟日呈破產之狀。資金外流。源源不絕。遂使上海等通商巨埠之存欵與現銀。顯�</p>
<p>示極度之膨脹。試觀當九一八事變之際。本埠存銀不過三萬萬元。目前則已達六萬萬元之巨。顧都巿之一般企業投資。亦有利潤日薄之患。由是剩餘資金。缺乏正當宣洩之途徑。而投機僥倖之心理。復隨恐慌而日增。結果乃爲賭博性質之經營。如賽馬·跑狗·以至有獎儲蓄等。造成趁勢搜括之機會。吸引巨量資金而風行於上海。無如頭腦簡單者。雖蒙其害而猶不自覺也。</p>
<p>由是觀之。有獎儲蓄之急需取締。已無疑義。今立法院通過之儲蓄銀行法。旣有於七月初開始實行之說。則有獎儲蓄之禁止。當爲時日問題。邇來本巿巿黨部·巿商會·巿民聯合會·總工會等。皆有請求取締之表示。以爲立法院後盾。惟外人之辦理此項業務者。今後必出全力以爲掙扎之計。此事之前途如何。將視當局者之毅力以爲轉移自不待言。吾人尤應注意者。對儲戶利益之如何保障。確尙須妥爲籌計。是亦策劃萬全之一道耳。</p>

<p>（倫敦）昨日內閣會議之後、今日據外交界方面消息、英國擴充空軍計劃、卽將迅速成熟云、昨晨所傳下星期政府將以鉅額之空軍補充預算提交國會之說、今晨已由可靠方面否認、惟衆院於下月休會之前、將有補充預算提出、則確在預料之中、據消息靈通者言、空軍擴充計劃、將較海陸軍方面所提出之預算增加、高出許多、近來久已傳說、英國政府擬於五年內將海陸兩方空車力量增加一倍之計劃、今日似有證實之象、惟若干方面則謂擴充之期爲七年或十年而非五年、至此項擴充計劃、業已成熟、則已顯然可見、政府方面及有勢力之報紙如每日郵報·每日捷報·及晚報皆已使公衆明瞭空防準備之必要、全國必須合力解囊相助、以促成此舉云、據專家估計、英國如將空軍增加一倍、連飛行人員及機塲在內、需欵二千五百萬磅、故政府决以長期計畫行之、蓋政府若於一年以內完成此舉、則必須加稅、此種冒險舉動、當非現內閣所敢爲、且政府中人亦以爲目前並無戰事發生之危險、固不妨逐步進行、以使英國空軍現居世界第六位者、漸與其他歐洲國家之空軍力量相等、大槪英國或將先微露其擴充之意、俾法德等國見空軍競爭之將趨於極端、或可終於順從英國之意、而成立限制國際空軍條約、該項條約現在爲法國所反對者也、查軍縮會議屢瀕絕境、英國所提空軍恊定、爲最後挽救之努力、倘在不能成功、則英國將現有之飛機一千五百架、擴充至三千架、俾與法車相等、政府所宣布之方案、爲英國空軍須與在可以攻擊之距離中、空軍力量最强之國家相等、一般人皆知德國之空軍已可與法國抗衡、且外間皆傳尙在秘密擴充中、故英國亦不得不急起直追、至於美國、則英國與之相較、更覺瞠乎其後、此亦主張擴充空軍者所視爲重要之理由也、（二十七日國民電）</p>

<p>民國二三年間、釐定官制、於中央設鹽務署及稽核總所、同隸於財政部、各產鹽區、設鹽運使運副及稽核分支所、各銷鹽區、設榷運局·及稽核處·或收稅局、分別隷屬於鹽務署及稽核總所、由是鹽務一項、分爲兩大部分、別之爲行政、爲稽核、行政機關、主管塲產運銷曁緝私事宜、稽核機關、主管徵收鹽稅秤放鹽斤體編造報告事宜、旣有駢枝之嫌、且多牽制之累、不獨經費虛糜、實於整理鹽務、大有妨碍、在根本上、本已錯誤、最大原因、厥有兩端、</p>
<p>就政治原理言之、鹽務行政、以收稅爲主要、假無鹽稅、何有鹽務、鹽之爲物、產出於塲、銷歸於岸、是其來源全在於產、去路全在於銷、「必有年銷年額之產、乃有年銷年額之稅、鹽無所銷、稅從何出、而產銷之樞紐、全在於運、無論何人、如欲運鹽、必須照章繳稅、始能秤放、有稅者曰官鹽、漏稅者曰私鹽、官不敵私、稅收卽有損失、杜防私漏、又在於緝、緝私者所以保稅、故塲務運務緝務、皆爲稅務而設、鹽稅根源、全在塲產與運銷、其事甚繁、其貴宜專、與普通收稅之事、絕不相同、則稅務與政務、卽絕對不能劃分、此其錯誤者一、</p>
<p>就官制歷史言之、中國鹽務、自漢唐以來、卽已設有專官、漢以大農領鹽事、是爲鹽務隸屬財政部之始、（漢制、大農令、其職、例如今之財政部長、大農之下、另組獨立機關、設有鹽丞一人、主管全國鹽務、）宋以戶部左曹、掌勾考鹽、稅以周知其登耗、是爲鹽務稽核之始、（宋制、戶部主管勾考全國鹽稅之數、實爲現今稽核所這職掌、勾考云者、亦卽稽核最初之名詞、）沿及明淸時代、各省鹽課、例歸戶部稽核是爲稽核名詢所由起、蓋自宋以降、中央行政最高機關、所職掌者、卽爲稽核事務、凡產數銷數、皆在稽核之列、非止稅欵一項、而稽核鹽稅、實爲重要之行政、民國初年、强將產銷運緝等項、劃爲行政、已與官制原則相遠、此其錯誤者又、</p>
<p>整理鹽務、原爲剷除積弊、增進稅收起見、但因職權劃分、根本旣已錯誤、舉凡塲產之整頓、運銷之變通、緝私之改良、種種問題、皆與徵收鹽稅、有密切之關係、稽核方面、必須與行政方面、會同商議、然事關行政、應由行政機關主辦、而行政人員、囿於弊習、安於腐化、或因意見不參差、或因權限之爭執、或因貪取規費、極力反對、甚或陽表贊同、陰圖破壞、往往因一事之防阻、遂致全局之多碍、雖說民國三四五年、稽核方面、對於整理問題、銳意進行、稅收與年俱增、稍著成績、究以事權不一、進行不易、辦理一切、皆是枝枝節節而爲之、終未有整個之改革、</p>
<p>民國二十年、始以緝私事務、關係稅收、亟應整理、於是年三月、改歸稽核總分所管轄、接管以後、卽將舊有緝私營隊、從新編制、改爲稅警、並將營制、改爲區制、切實整頓、嚴加訓練、從前緝私之種種惡習、近則逐漸革除、查緝私鹽、頗稱得力、民國二十一年又以整理鹽務、要在統一事權、掃除積弊、並爲裁汰冗員、節省經費起見、於是年七月、將行政機關、改由稽核人員兼任、接辦以後、首將原有各項陋規、嚴行裁革、實緣行政方面、積弊最大者、莫甚於收受規費一事、鹽政腐敗、亦由於此、近則事權統一、對於整理塲產運銷、同時舉辦、務期達到整個之改革、兼辦未久、成效已屬可觀、民國十八年、稅收爲八千五百萬元、民國二十二年、增至一萬五千九百萬元、若將東三省亦包括在內、則爲一萬八千四百萬元、與民國十八年相較、增加一倍有奇（見附表一）</p>
<p>稽核所兼理鹽務行政緝私與否、與稅收之增加、旣有顯著之關係、稽核所兼辦鹽務行政緝私之十一區、民國二十年與二十二年相較、稅收增加二千一百萬餘元、而稽核所未兼辦之八區、僅增二百萬餘元、（見附表二）</p>
<p>稽核所兼辦行政後、各區行政經費大減、淮南·淮北·松江·兩浙·山東·福建·安徽·河南·湖北·湖南·江西·等十一區、二十年度行政經費爲二百八十萬元、自行政兼併後、二十二年度預算、減爲七十三萬元、兩相比較、實減二百十五萬元、（見附表三）而此十一區之稅收、二十年與二十二年相較、反增二千一百餘萬元、已如上述、稽核所未兼辦行政之八區、二十二年稅收爲四千三百萬元、與兼辦行政之十一區相比較（十一區稅收爲一萬一千五百萬元）僅及三分之一、而行政經費反多四倍、（二十二年度、未兼辦行政之八區、行政經費爲二百八十三萬元、兼辦之十一區爲七十三萬元（見附表四、）卽廣東一區、運使公署等經費、每年達七十五萬元、超過兼辦</p>
<p>十一區行政經費之總數、不欲整理鹽務則已、如欲整理鹽務、開源節流、革除積弊、鹽務行政、自應歸併於稽核所、</p>
<p>自稽核所兼辦十一區行政以來、行政經費之减少、已如上述、而稽核所本身之稽核經費、亦有</p>
<p>减無增、</p>
<p>二十年度八、四三一、○○○元</p>
<p>二十一年度八、○○○、○○○元</p>
<p>二十二年度七、三二一、○○○元</p>
<p>以稽核所本身之經費與稅收比較、僅佔百分之四强、較之北京時代之稽核所、亦有减無增、（見附圖）</p>
<p>山東·淮北·淮南·松江·兩浙·湖北·湖南·安徽·江西·河南·福建·等十一區之緝私、在稽核所未兼辦以前、十八年度官警二萬一千餘人、每年經費三百八十一萬餘元、稽核所兼辦後、二十二年度、官警减爲一萬五千餘人、經費三百九十一萬元、兩相比較、人數減少、經費徵有增加、此由於改善警士之待遇、以資養廉之故、但就近數年來之經騐、緝私之人數經費、均須增加、以便增加緝私之效能、俟將來各區倉坨建築·塲務管理辦理完善後、緝私警力、及緝私經費、當可大加裁减、</p>
<p>綜而論之、整理鹽務、就是在增進稅收、最先辦法、就是在廓淸積弊、矧就政治原理、與官制歷史而言、鹽務之要、以收稅爲主體、稽核稅欵、卽爲重要之行政、所謂塲產運銷緝私者、皆是稽核機關應辦之事、何能於稽核外、更設駢枝之機關、所當亟爲糾正者也、現今專商未廢、行政機關名義尙在、自應實行歸併、更作進一步之革</p>

<p>舉幾個例：譬如淸燉肥鴨，便是太后所非常愛吃的一樣菜。它的煮法是先把鴨子去毛、去肝臟，再洗凈，然後加上一些調味品，把來裝在一個磁罐子裏；再把這個磁罐子裝在一個盛着一半淸水的鉗鍋裏，緊緊地蓋上了鍋蓋，不使它走氣，就是這樣儘讓文火把它蒸着，一連蒸上三天，鴨子便完全酥了，酥得可以不必用刀割，只須筷子去夾，也可以絕不費力的夾開。那時候就可以給你大嚼了！皇太后雖然有時也夾些鴨肉吃，但多份是夾鴨皮吃的；因爲那層鴨皮，才是這一碗菜裏最精美可口的一部份。</p>
<p>除了淸燉肥鴨這一味佳餚之外，下面的幾樣，也是太后的餐桌上所常有的東西，並且也是伊所歡喜的幾種。</p>
<p>燻炙一類的東西，似乎最合太后的口味，像烤鴨，燒乳猪，燻鷄，煨羊腿等等，差不多是不斷的會供呈上來的。這些東西當然不是什麽希品，尋常的百姓們在外面的酒菜館裏也儘可以享受得到，不過宮裏頭的烹調法，多少總比外面更考究些。據太后自己說，伊年輕時候，最愛吃的一味菜是燒猪肉皮。它的煮法是先把帶皮的猪肉切成一方一方的小塊，然後再放在猪油裏面煎着，結果是煎到那肉上的皮，脆得比什麽東西都脆了，它的滋味就着實的够人垂涎。（七○）</p>
<h3 id="c197">女人的鈕扣 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 銳利</p>
<p>贛省府奉蔣委員長令，訂定取締婦女奇裝異服辦法，對於婦女服裝有詳細的規定；但沒有提及旗袍的鈕扣問題。</p>
<p>女人旗袍的鈕扣多得數不淸，至於凖確的數目，我不能說出。因爲我沒有女友肯給我緩緩地數。大公司櫉櫃外雖時有竚足觀望的女人。我有時想留心去數，可是我是近視眼，視力很遲鈍，往往快要數好的時候，而伊又走了。所以我久想要數一數女人的鈕扣，終歸無法償願。有一朋友（當然是男友）告訴我，他數過某小姐的鈕扣有十七對，他的視力比我勝，大致不會錯的。</p>
<p>鈕扣的作用，無非藉以使衣服不至鬆散，像我們男子的長衫有六對，已很够用了。何必定要多至十七對呢？况成衣匠多做鈕扣，必多費工夫，工資也因而增加。一件單衫的工價，竟高至三四元之多，影響於著者自身的物質，却是很大的！還有著的時候，解開鈕好，亦很費時，我以爲處在現在複雜的社會裏，對於自己服用的東西，應以簡單化爲標凖，省出來的時間幹些有益的事。像日本人的服裝，只用帶子一束就完了。西洋人的也沒有幾個鈕扣，這或者也可以表現他們的民族性，不肯浪用時間。</p>
<p>明解縉「題宮人鈕扣」詩，頗含幽默意味。錄之如下：「一幅絞綃剪素羅；美人體態勝姮娥。春心若肯牢關鎖，鈕扣何須用許多？」現在的女人，喜歡鈕扣做得多，是不是爲了要牢關春民的緣故，那我可不知道了。</p>
<h3 id="c198">金魚舊話 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>金魚的飼養，確是一種很有詩意的玩好。老友瘦鵑吉人，都是有金魚癖的，瘦鵑還把魚的形式顏色，配上詞牌名，更覺有趣。</p>
<p>宋岳珂程史說：「今中都有豢魚者，能變魚以金色，鯽爲上，鯉次之。貴游多精鑿石爲池，寘之簷牖間以供玩。問其術，秘不肯言。或云。以　市誇渠之小紅蟲飼凡魚，百日皆然，初白如銀，次漸黃，久則金矣。未暇騐其信否也。」這一節話，太不合科學了，金鯽魚金鯉魚自有種子，决不吃了小紅蟲可以變色的。又說：「逆曦之歸蜀，汲湖水浮載，凡三巨艘以從，詭狀瑰麗，不止二種。」曦是秦檜的兒子，從杭州到四川，巨艘載魚，可算得愛魚成癖，千古無兩了。</p>
<p>金魚見於昑詠的，有蘇子美的「松橋扣金鯽，竟日獨遲留。」蘇東坡的「我識南屏金鯽魚。」再前些，大槪還有，我却沒見過。</p>
<p>湘練樓日記說：「左季高父養金魚一缸，以子多少爲門徒盛衰，一歲子多，其父數及門某某當入學，不及季高。左年九歲，甚慍，乘𨻶盡殺缸中魚，父詰之，對以情。」把金魚當作門徒功名占騐的蓍龜，也是異想天開。那位公子，偏又信以爲眞，遷怒於魚，更是奇談。金魚有此遭逢，眞是大不幸事。季高一生言行，都有些辣味的，於此已有一點見端了。</p>
<p>這幾天南方交霉令，金魚的磨折時期到了，要是不留神，就得生病。故都的金魚市面是狠盛的，那邊沒有霉令，大槪不致受黃梅天氣的磨折罷，我在初到蘇州的那年，也養過一缸金魚，在兩三天內，全給黃梅天氣犧牲了，那麽左季高可說是有黃梅脾氣了，呵呵！</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>我雖不能畫，郤頗喜和幾位丹靑朋友談談畫理，前天在席間晤着陶冷月君，他不但於技術上，已造高峯，理論方面，也是相當的發揮，他說：「普通人對於圖畫，往往加以生動兩字的讚美，實則動不如靜，靜的工夫，較勝於動，故套句成語，可以說是與其動也寗靜，况且現在人心尙未厭亂，大戰卽在目前，屆時生靈塗炭，物質損失，令人不堪設想，那麽這殺機便伏在動字中，若然我們再在縑素間推波助瀾作動的前奏，這是萬萬使不得的。所以我的畫，總是一丸凉月，寂照谿山，使人對之靜默默的出一回神，什麽名咧，利咧，爭咧，攘咧，一古攏兒蠲除殆盡，彷彿用靜的畫來祈禱世界和平，」鄙人聽了他這番理論，不覺爲之首肯。</p>
<p>他去歲曾一度遠游蜀中，順道瀟湘七澤間，登南嶽衡山，因爲他的畫什九是夜靜月明的境界，便在嘉陵江畔，祝融峯頭過宿，成稿數十百幀，此次在八仙橋靑年會開會展覽，中西人士，沒有個不歎賞，足見江山之助，不獨司馬文章爲然呢。</p>

<p>第三十一回三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣　全營殉國赤眼入槍林</p>
<p>自强帶着弟兄進了夾溝以後，太陽已經變了慘紅，落到山峰西去，溝裏陰森森地，寒氣襲人。大家在雪地裏走着，脚完全都埋在雪裏面了。大家都不作聲，只有那脚步在積雪裏一拔一踏的動作，更在岑寂的環境中，加上一倍的嚮。自强走到一堵突出的懸岩下，就呌弟兄們一齊縮到岩底下去。這裏是個避風的所在，雖然地上還有幾寸積雪，但是沒有割人皮膚的風向身上吹來，這就感到舒服的多了。當弟兄的人，向來只知道服從命令，到那裏去，去做什麽，一槪是不容問的。所以在這個時候，弟兄們隨着自强的命令，一齊進到突崖下面去。各人心裏也就想着，堡子裏那樣好的防禦工事，丟了不守，却要跑到這山溝裏來。而且現在又不見敵人一個鬼影，要這樣藏藏躱躱，又不知爲了什麽？不過長官的命令，就是對的，誰也不能在表面上放出懷疑的態度來。也就是在這個時候，自强忽然放出緊張的態度，連連喊着道：臥倒臥倒！大家在深雪地裏很艱難的走到了這裏，實在也有些受累，得了休息的機會，步伍也就散慢了，這時聽了臥倒的命令，也明知道是危險到來的意思。大家一陣紛亂就在雪地裏臥着。趙自强本人不顧積雪深淺，也是跟着臥了下去，因爲連長臥倒以後，什麽聲音也沒有發出來，所以大家也就靜悄悄的，立刻心靈沉靜了，五官也可以管事。就在這時，發現了軋軋的飛機響聲，在半空裏震動着。那響聲逐漸的加重，最後就響到腦袋上來。這裏雖是個山溝，可是抬起頭來，總還看到一條縫的靑天。就在這時，那飛機飛得很低的，由山來縫頂上直掠過去。（四二一）</p>

<p>這是現在一般人所不屑措意的迂腐之談。但我總得奉勸現在具有和諸葛靚同樣身份的人，切勿採用禮義廉明忠誠果毅一類過於「冠冕」的名字，因爲，假使或許遇到孫皓那種傻傢伙，怕就沒有諸葛靚說得嘴響啦！</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>今日科學昌明，觀測氣象的方法，當然以天文學爲依據的。然而在科學未發達時代，專靠動物的動靜，預卜天氣的變化，而動物中鳥獸蟲魚，能占天候的晴雨，從溫度，濕度，氣壓，日光照射等情形，根據氣象學的原理，屢試屢騐的很多，分據如下：</p>
<p>金魚我們如用深一尺五寸，直徑六寸的金魚缸一隻，缸底舖以黃沙，種植水藻，缸水盛滿十分之八，放入三年的金魚二三尾，仍舊照普通金魚的飼養法，毫無差異，那末可以就金魚的生活狀態，判斷天氣了譬如今後，要想出門，想預知會不會下雨，可在金魚缸裏一看就明白了。就是天氣會晴，魚缸的水中，含有充分的酸素，那金魚必穩穩靜靜的沉在缸底，假使空氣漸濕，好像要下雨的樣子，金魚在水中吸收酸素，很感困難，漸漸要浮到上面，甚至把嘴伸出了水面，吸收酸素，呼吸亦很急促，那末，經過了三四小時，必定要下雨的，此法，從五月起到十月中間，最爲靈騐。但是蓄養的缸與蓄養的魚數，要照上面所定，如缸小魚多，又不種水藻，仍舊不能預報天氣的。（缸小魚多，因水中酸素不能配給生活，也要浮出水面）然而爲什麽要種水藻於金魚缸底呢？並不是專爲裝飾美觀，因爲水藻爲植物，從水外吸收多量的空氣，把窒素爲自己的營養素，消化吸收，其酸素向水中吐出，因此金魚不論水溫如何昇高，倘若不是天候不良，仍受這酸素的好處，就是缸水不換，也平平靜靜的沉在水底生活，所以有了水藻的補救，得了許多的酸素。從前老釣魚的人，應用這金魚的天氣預報理由，可以推想到河川中魚的生活，在天晴時候，魚必在水底游泳，其釣魚的钩餌，應當沉到水底，若要下雨時，因爲魚呼吸困難，就會浮游到水面的，釣魚的钩餌，當然要浮在上面爲宜。這樣一想，蓄養金魚，不但可以定天氣的晴雨，也可以作釣魚的指南啊。</p>
<p>靑蛙靑蛙的啼聲與下雨的關係，最爲靈騐，據日本大阪測候所長前田氏的實騐，靑蛙一啼，在三十小時以內，必要下雨。他在帶廣地方實騐，得了百分之六四成績，在和歌山實騐，得了百分之七零成績，在潮岬實騐，得了百分之五二成績，平均的統計，有百分之六二靈騐，所以靑蛙，又稱爲雨蛙。</p>
<p>貓狗貓用前肢，撫摩耳朶時（從耳的後面，撫摩到面上）是表示天氣將晴的預兆。如貓與狗都　草時，那可預卜天將下雨了。</p>
<p>鷄自早至晚，徘徊不停的覓食，是下雨的預兆。</p>
<p>雀黃雀在河川洗浴，是天晴的預兆。</p>
<p>舞高空，是天將晴的預兆，飛翔低空，急欲覓食，是將雨的徵候。</p>
<p>蟻白蟻出，是證明天候繼續不變。</p>
<p>蛇蛇登木，是下雨的前兆。</p>
<p>蚯蚓蚯蚓若鳴，是天晴的微候。</p>

<p>粉巿上午開盤後、各月份又呈激昂狂熱之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好四分至一角左右、坎拿大小四八分不等、惟近來巿塲人心、對於國外情形、已少注意、目下最大之焦點、則以各處亢旱、田禾受損、米價旣受影響、遂轉注目光、趁勢狂進粉麥、並以華北通車、以爲東三省之去路、可以回復、將來之事實是否如是、則熱中之時、未加考慮、因此開價後、近遠各月份、均紛紛高漲、計近跳二三分、遠跳三四分、如十一月份竟狂跳至二元三角　分、此種情形、見於小麥豐收之時、實少充分之理數也、迨至下午開盤、初仍見狂激之態、惟極度高漲、有一部分之獲利投機多頭、趁勢回出、日傳華北得雨、無鍚米回二角、稻回二角、麥小五分、故人心已轉軟弱、並以一再高昂、將來易引洋粉麥之來華、此種情形、實有回顧二三年來之可能性也、結果本月份及七月份仍較漲三分、八月份至十月份各好二分七厘半、十一月份好一分七厘半、</p>

<p>— 迂</p>
<p>據說好手着棋，一着等於若干着。國之君子，單方面的買賣是不幹的，功效應在乎意想不到，好處在於多方。例如購物一元，也同時吃到附送之冰淇淋一盒，或得航空獎劵一張，有五十萬元之希望，這方樂意的。</p>
<p>這是一種多方面之妙道。潑婦駡街，指着的是甲，駡着的是乙，被駡的是丙，氣苦的是丁，同時也表现了自已。這種道法，廣博深奧，無怪昔之秋郎，有「駡人藝術」，一種大著了。</p>
<p>卽如最近「科學靈乩」，實是一種偉大的發明，也是妙着。你們迷信西洋科學麽？請看科學的靈乩。如果鄙視靈乩，則也要不信科學了；增加了靈乩的聲勢，提倡新文化者便倒霉，但毒箭國貨！而且，很快的普及中國各地哩，說不定還要悠久下去的。那力量，實遠勝刀鋒或筆尖。</p>
<p>社會上不是嘲笑某種人爲「八面鋒」麽？略看交際名流，應酬賓客，方方面周到，便可彷彿一二。但可不要誤會忙着八張舌頭談話，而是說一句話使八個人聽了各覺私親，認爲滿意。西洋有一種球戲，一球打倒八九根柱，可以形容這本領的。</p>
<p>但「八面鋒」之流成功者少，是什麽緣故呢？因爲旣非直道，目的又繁多，力量便分散了。力量一分，其結果便弱，要各方面不受攻擊，結果只得圓滑，變成水晶球，倒是鋒稜不能遍着，而終於失敗了。反之，鍥而不舍，以單破複，易於奏效的。何况人道無窮，國手豈不是也有輸時麽？</p>
<h3 id="c252">我也談談文言與白話的論爭問題 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 姜琦</p>
<p>自從汪懋祖與吳研因兩先生開始文言與白話的論爭以來，使本來不成問題的問題，又惹起一般人的注意；尤其是上海文學界同人如陳望道，陳子展，曹聚仁，樂嗣炳，胡愈之諸先生在本刊都有言論發表；聽說還有許多位正在那裏預備稿子。但是他們所發表過的言論，大都是站在整個社會的立塲，討論怎樣地把語言這個工具普遍化與通俗化，使一般人不論上智，中材，與下愚都能懂得並且都能交換意見，所以他們中有另創「大衆語」之建議。我因爲受了他們的囑託。要我參加些意見：現在我姑且縮小範圍，單站在敎育的立場，把小學校，尤其把小學校第一年級國語敎科書應否用文言或白話這一個問題提出來討論一下吧。</p>
<p>固然，在汪先生的方面，他並沒有主張在小學校第一年級必須採用文言而不應該採用白話，他不過主張學校敎育應該隨牠的年級之增高，由白話而兼用白話與文言，到了大學時代可以完全採用文言而已。這樣，那麽，在小學校第一年級，無論汪先生，吳先生乃至上海文學界諸先生，都是一致地主張採用白話，所以用不着什麽論爭。現在所成問題的，祇在於小學校第一年級國語敎科書應該怎樣編輯，具體地說，牠應該採用那類的白話體才是對的呢？因爲胡愈之先生指出白話體好有機種：如五四運動以後的白話，語錄體，禮拜六派及張恨水一派的語體乃至陳子展先生所提出的「大衆語」等等，所以今後的小學校第一年級國語敎科書的內容所採用的白話體就發生問題了。但是現在我個人對於這個問題不願也未便發表什麽意見，所要說的，祗得姑且借用日本小學國語讀本第一冊，把牠檢討檢討，看看日本的方面對於這個問題究竟怎樣，然後把我所檢討的結果寫出來，以供我國敎育界同人之參考而已。</p>
<p>從來的日本小學國語讀本是假名與讀字兼用的，不消說小學校高年級的國語讀本是這樣的，就是小學校第一年級的國語讀本，除掉最第一，二頁全用假名外，其餘各頁至少總有一個或二，三個的漢字，頁數越增，那麽，漢字越多。至於現在呢，請拿昭和七年十二月文部省印刷發行的尋常科用小學國語讀本第一冊來一讀，就不難發見日本敎科書大大改革了。具體地說，日本小學國語讀本第一冊雖仍兼用假名與漢字，但是漢字字數寥寥無幾了。牠自第一頁到第二十五頁止沒有一個漢字，完全是假名；直到第二十六頁才有「一」，「二」，「三」，「四」</p>
<p>等漢字的插入；自第二十七頁到第三十頁又完全是假名；到了第四十頁才有「山」，「川」，「小」，「木」，「五」等漢字的插入；以後在第四十二頁祇有「大」一個漢字，第四十四頁有「六」，「七」，「八」，「九」，「十」等漢字；第四十五頁重新把自「一」字起到「十」字止幾個數字複提一下，在第四十六，第四十七兩頁所有的漢字也不過把前幾頁所提示過的漢字如「木」，「山」兩個漢字重提一下而已。以後在第四十八頁提出「日」字，第五十頁提出「目」字，第五十七頁提出「中」字，第六十頁提出「犬」字，第六十七頁提出「上」字，第七十二頁提出「人」字，除此以外，再沒有提示別的漢字了。總計這山國語讀本的頁數共有七十八頁，其中所佔的漢字數，不過「一，二，三，四，五，六，七，八，九，十，山，川，小，木，大，日，目，中，犬，上，人，」等二十一個字而已；况且這二十一個漢字祗是日常所通用的數的槪念及極淺近的觀念。由此，可見日本敎育是表現着極力減少漢字字數而趨重多用假名之傾向，將來牠完全不用漢字而專用假名，也未可知。我敢斷言的，日本的這種傾向，决非出於所謂「保存國粹」的敎育政策，而是根據於新敎育學的主張。</p>
<p>假使日本的這種主張是對的話，那麽，我們中國今後的小學校國語敎科書問題，不是文言與白話的論爭問題，而是「注音字母」與「注音符號」的取捨問題。這個問題，又是非常浩大，我也未便過問，姑留待敎育行政當局自去解决吧。</p>

<h3 id="c253">緬京雜記 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>㈠在野蠻的地方，鄕親二字的確還有相當的作用；但在文明的城巿，却並不然了。像在緬甸舊京曼德里，倘若你初去時不識街道，正在車輛交馳間，舉足彷徨之際，就一迎頭來的中國人而有所問詢的話，那末，多半是聽着這樣緬甸語原回答：</p>
<p>「南悶勒補。」</p>
<p>意思是不懂你的話，隨卽人也板着臉走了。大約認了鄕親，就更容易惹起另外的麻煩吧：如請臨時帮忙，託找事做。因而，鄕親二字在這裏，如同暑天腐爛的水果一樣，是賣不起價錢的。</p>
<p>倒是一些開店子的回敎印度人，略略懂點子中國話的，當你從他店舖門前經過時，反而會學着雲南人的嘴巴，很親切地招呼道：</p>
<p>「老鄕，進來看看，買不買，不凖賬的。」</p>
<p>把這兩兩相較，人和人之間是可以意味出另外的東西來的。</p>
<p>㈡</p>
<p>緬甸，這椰子榴槤的國度，在旅途中，我是意味着牠有多量的浪漫氣息的；但一到曼德里，在伊拉瓦底江的輪渡上，望見東岸靑山的一翼，正於細雨迷濛的景色中，送到無數白色的佛塔，和第二天早上，披衣樓頭，看見黃衣托　的僧人，在晨光泛濫的街頭，一隊隊地現由</p>
<p>了出來時，却又給人以嚴肅之感了。</p>
<p>不過，也並不使人覺到陰森，這大約由他們不像我們中國人這樣拘泥吧。像一般和尙，旣可天天吃魚吃肉，還得自由戀愛哩。因爲，倘若愛上了一個年靑的信女，或是施主的女兒，便可將袈裟脫了，還俗去。這在他們，是自古已然的事情，誰也不來非難的。</p>
<p>因此，這個國度裏的禁慾和縱慾，並不怎樣衝突的，：：：只要在曼德里住上兩三天，便會深深覺出這種風氣了。</p>
<p>㈢</p>
<p>「騰越廳志」載先前曼德里的情形：「周圍有磚城，六十二里，立十二門，外設木柵，禁驟馳。」我看見的時候，木柵已經沒有了，而且也並不禁止驟馳，因爲已經有着發亮的兩條鐵軌，毫不客氣地伸進城門洞去了。城樓上架着大砲，着黃斜紋軍服的洋兵，鎭日在側邊防守着。</p>
<p>城墻的樣式，滿帶中國風，據說這是從前緬甸國王僱請中國工匠修造的。年程，看起來尙不久遠，像一般古城應具的特色：殘缺之外，且加藤蔓的點綴，那是一些也沒有的。</p>
<p>城外「南爲漢人街，多漢人貿易。西爲洋人街，大小共七十二街。」這是光緒十一年的情形。倘如追溯到未有漢人街洋人街以前，我想那街巿的狀况，一定是很有趣的吧。「滇南雜誌」記緬一王以下「則有四大萬，次則爲萬韜，其外則有七萬。」「各萬無俸，令其做買賣，以取利爲官資。」這樣看來，做官和當老板，是成爲分不開的事情，那末，官府和商店，不是合併爲一，大約也是緊鄰着的了。</p>

<p>他們是幸福的丨丨沒有多少時候。但是官感的戀愛是一種陶醉，當他們從這種陶醉中醒來而回復了他們的感覺的時候，他倆便不禁要喊起來：</p>
<p>『我們拿什麽來維持生活呢？我們沒有錢！我們沒有東西吃。』</p>
<p>他們還沒有說完，這時却有人在叩門了。於是一個不認識的人走了進來。</p>
<p>『我可以有和卡爾先生說幾句話的榮幸嗎？』</p>
<p>卡爾聽了，昏亂而且驚慌着，因爲他覺得那個人是他們所曾碰見過的。</p>
<p>『你不回答，』這不認識的人繼續着說，『但是話的驚慌却已證明了你就是我所要拜訪的人了。我請求你在這一小紙上簽了字。在從今天起的的一年以後，我還會來拜望你。不要忘記丨丨剛好一年。再會。』</p>
<p>這個神秘的人走了。可是這時候，這一對情人的驚慌和快慰，究竟那一種較爲强烈，這是很難說的了。因爲這個不認識的人給他的那張紙，是足够供給他們一年奢華的生活的一筆欵子的支票。依照着那見票照付的寫法，錢是立刻可以付給他們的。</p>
<p>『這可不懂了，』安娜夫人看着支票說。</p>
<p>『這眞莫明其妙了。』卡爾同意着。『黃金掉給我們，正像天賜的甘露一般。』</p>
<p>現在他們可以很幸福的生活了。他們不會受着物質的壓迫。現在他們想那個商人當然是不認識他們的。要是他認識，他爲什麽不去告訴安德羅呢？</p>
<p>『到了一年之期，』卡爾說，『這個不認識的人又要來了，我們將有更多的錢。他不是曾這樣說嗎？』</p>
<p>『是的。』</p>

<h3 id="c256">大衆語的疑問 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 笨伯</p>
<p>我做這篇勞什子的文字之前，先有幾句聲明，我根本上不懂大衆語怎樣做法，更不懂大衆語到底是怎樣一種文字，因爲我看見主張大衆語的幾位作家，無非夾頭夾腦，把文言文和白話文駡個痛快，而結果並沒有把大衆語怎樣作法，和怎樣通俗易行的妙處，先宣布出來，眞是令人「丈二長和尙，摸不着頭腦，」并且仔細地拜讀拜讀主張大衆語的作家文字，也一些嗅不到大衆語的氣味，還是藍靑官話的腔調，到是隨處可見，所以我根本上不懂得大衆語，究底是什麽一回事，所以要請敎請敎。</p>
<p>諸君倘以商榷的態度，誠懇地有所賜敎，在下不勝歡迎，倘然夾頭夾面，先來駡脫一頓，「老頑固」，「開倒車」，「反時代」，「落伍者」，等等的頭銜，一齊加封上來，我也只有掩住了嘴吧，一聲不響，聽憑諸君的痛駡，决不敢哼了一哼，再開一聲口，這是在下幾十年閱歷得來的一種敎訓。</p>
<p>若講到文字，從前的老古董，胎生地不要再去搬出來，先把最近的文字講講，就從民元以來，我國通用的文字，分別起來，約有四種。</p>
<p>一種是老牌镸古文，</p>
<p>一種是報章式的文字，</p>
<p>一種是翻譯式的文字，（或可稱爲歐化文字）。</p>
<p>一種是通常所謂白話文。（或者語體文）。</p>
<p>我搬這些出來，似和本問題一些不發生關係，但就可曉得文字的變遷，有時代性，和沿革性的，在這四種文字的中間，老牌古文的不合用，和貴族化，姑先提開不講。次談報章式文字，此種文字，白話也有，文言也有，若多加幾個「的」字或「呢」字，就可說是白話文，若再簡練潤飾一下，亦可說是文言文字，再次說到翻譯式的文字，幾輩洋秀才洋舉人，因爲嚴又陵林琴南等翻譯的文字，太覺晦塞難懂，故一變作風，改用白話來翻譯，因爲中西文字，到底語句不同，（外國文以主要字放在前面，以附屬字放在後面，中國文以附屬字放在前面，以主要字放在後面，一種是外演的，一種是歸的納，卽在中西信封上就可看出。）而譯出的文字，往往長至一筷以外，而其中的「的」字，數數到有兩三個以上，這就呌做翻譯式的文字，又其次，就是新文化運動以後，幾位作家所提倡的白話文了。</p>
<p>這四種文字之中，老牌古文，除公文中和壽序行述以外，已經用的絕少，而翻譯式的文字，因爲讀者的不了解，句子也漸漸地短起來了，惟有報章文字</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，和白話文，現在還很有力地通行無阻，不過報章文字，亦有人主張過，改用白話，到底因爲種種的窒礙，和白話文占篇幅地位太多，未能實行，或者這就是白話文的缺點，至於白話文字，尙屬推行未久，現在尙有一部份人，出頭反對，從這樣看來，就白話文本身言，尙未到穩固地步，尙未到至善地步，現在更有人主張大衆語了，其實現在的白話文，所以尙不能通行無阻，還有人起來反對摧殘，或者也因爲白話文尙不能至於至善之境，應該先把白話文來考究一下，整理一下，如實在改不好，再來提倡別種文字，如因爲白話文尙有難行的地方，不去考究，不去研求，就把他來推翻摧殘，再來提倡一種大衆語，我想這樣的進步，未免太迅速了麽？凡一種事件的發生和成功，總有一種時代性和沿革性的，决不能一步就跨到三十三天。</p>
<p>我先把這樣的沿革先弄淸了，再來談談大衆語，我統觀主張大衆語的作家，多是主張採用俗語，并且是極普通的俗語，這個意思，果然甚佳，我想實行起來，必定也有些困難，因爲各地的方言，多是不同，倘江蘇的人認爲通俗了，但別處的人或者還聽不懂，卽如寗波人的「阿拉」蘇州人的「裏篤」，常住上海的人聽來，果然是通俗了，倘使四川雲南貴州的人聽來，還是不懂。</p>
<p>其實俗語和文言，全在能通用和不通用，俗語用慣了，可成文言，文言用慣了，便可變成俗語，全在用慣，用久，自然普通，故在提倡大衆語之始，决不能立刻盡把文言變成俗語，其初也只有文言和俗語參用，明白點說，就是用些文言，用些白話，這樣久而久之，或者盡可變成俗語，亦未可知，决無一蹙卽到之理。</p>
<p>我見有幾位作家，一看見人偶然採用了一語文言，就說他是不澈底，這是未免太過火了，譬如湖北省發生了一件殺父的案件，便說鄂省的人盡是殺爺的，假定安徽省發生了刦掠案件，便說皖省的人盡是强盜，這不是一件笑話麽？其實白話文，亦只有三個條件，最爲重要，寫得出，講得出，聽得懂，從前滿淸的時候，亦有人提倡過統一國語，這種國語用什麽方法來統一呢？只有選定一種文言爲標凖語因此當時行政院中，大開其辯論，有的主張用河南語，因爲洛陽居中國之中，應該採中州語爲標凖，有的主張北京語，因爲北京是首都，應該以北京語爲標凖，雙方辯論的結果，主張勝利的天然屬於後者，（因爲我腦筋很壞的緣故，時間上或有差誤，但總有這樣一回事實，）統一到現在，眞正的官話，雖然能說的還少，而藍靑的官話，到是能說能聽的很多，我想主張大衆語的作家，倘亦以能寫能聽能講爲條件，不管他藍靑到若何程度，祗要人聽得懂，寫得出，講得出便是。何必更再去求別種方法呢？倘因爲現在的白話文，還有些不妥的地方，還是先拿白話文來改善一下，較爲便當，未識主張大衆語的作家，對於在下的意見如何。</p>

<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>丨婦女園地第十九期丨</p>
<p>夢想是誰都免不了要有的。人的一生含辛茹苦的活着，也可說是在憧憬着，追求着未來的夢境的；假使人類沒有了夢想，或許也會由此而亡滅。</p>
<p>夢想在自己的腦子中，原是眞實的，自由的；但，將牠在白紙上寫出來，就免不了要有多少的虛僞和矯飾了；原因是神志淸醒時說話，是不能不顧慮到人間的各方面的。在「我理想中的未來生活專號」裏說夢的這些女作者，她們所說的夢，其虛僞矯飾程度怎樣，現在不能推度出來，就姑當爲完全眞實來看吧。</p>
<p>這十一個受過高等敎育的女靑年，有的是在憧憬着找個理想中的情人，過着賢妻良母的生活；有的是在渴慕着自然的美景，欲在山淸水秀的孤村中，悠閒自適地了此一生；有的是在企求着找個相當的職業，免再依靠人家的供養，忍受人家的制肘；有的是感覺到現在中國的情形是這麽的紛亂，婦女在社會上的地位是這麽的卑下，而欲獻身爲國家，爲自己去奮鬥。她們所說的夢想，雖然是這麽的分歧不同；但歸根結蒂來說，大多數仍舊是在迷戀個人的「享樂的，富於詩意的生活。」</p>
<p>在中國，受過高等敎育的婦女，也可說是最前進，最覺醒的了。數千年來緊緊地束縛在舊道德舊禮法中，像羔羊一樣屈服在丈夫的權威下的婦女們，近數十年來，由於對建制度的崩壞，和許多覺醒者們的奮鬥的結果，一部分雖已由舊的樊籠中逃出來了；但一撇開了舊的覊絆，新來的職業鎖鍊，又已緊緊地在項頸上掛着了。出賣姿色的事情，不是到處都有嗎？「花瓶」的呌聲，不是到處都可聽見嗎？成千成萬的可憐婦女們，正在渴望着這些先進的覺醒的同性來提携，來解救她們，而這些先進覺醒者們，只一味不顧，而迷戀携粉紅色的夢想，那不呌人歎氣！</p>
<p>讀完這一期專號，對於婦女運動的前途，在我腦子中，浮現携一個可怕的陰影；我唯一的希望是，所說的這些夢，完全是虛僞的，矯飾的！</p>

<p>但我們只要是稍有記性稍有理智，便毫無遲疑地可以斷定這完全是事實，一點也不是「夢」。這是中國現社會中必然產生的現象，毫用不着驚奇！</p>
<p>一切社會制度，愈走上不可避的沒落的途程，愈變成殘酷。因爲舊社會沒</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>落的另一面便是新社會的抬頭，沒落的過程愈急激，守舊與趨新的對立陣勢便愈激昂，激昂到了一定的點，舊的才被拋棄，新的同時產生。</p>
<p>歷史的地說，中國的封建宗法制度現在該是沒落的了。但是事實告訴我們，它的慘毒却一天甚似一天。上月初間秦理齋夫人子女全家的自盡，早已把這時代落伍的制度的萬惡暴露於世了。這次九女聯盟的自殺，尤其表示一個慷慨悲歌社會的現象。它們是具有歷史意義的重大現象；而不是偶然發生的値得憐恤的事情；不是她們怯懦卑下的舉動；而是一種悲壯慘烈的行爲啊！</p>
<p>同日的申報上又登載杭州女中學生某亦因婚姻問題自殺的一則消息，更足證明這一類的現象是遍中國各地到處皆然的。何况內地閉塞之區，而同時又是宗法制度最有勢力的地方，正不知道幾多同類的事象，用各種各樣的方式發生着，而終爲鬼怪神蹟等强大勢力各種手段所掩飾，不能見於報端引起大家的注意哩。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我不能不向我覺悟的中國婦女大衆大聲疾呼：歷史的推動全在人力，婦女居人類半數，對人類前途自然負有一半的使命，而况舊社會賜與婦女們的一切毒害，更勝於男子，依壓迫愈大反抗愈强的原理，婦女的反抗力該比男子更强！壓迫太重，與其忍苦偷生，不如痛快自殺。但是自殺總要有些意義，若白白送死，則死有什麽意義呢？</p>
<h3 id="c261">三等病房 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>一間簡陋的三等病房裏，縱橫的放着六隻病床，在每一隻的床前，都擺着一隻小方几，几上擱着一把茶壺和一隻痰盆。裏面的空氣是十分沉寂的，除了幾個病人的咳嗽聲，和呻吟聲之外，幾乎連一些生氣都沒有！</p>
<p>吾被送進××醫院的時候，神經異�</p>
<p>常的錯亂所以一些也不知道；直到被睡在一隻靠牆壁的白漆小鐵床上後，一股臭藥水的氣味，直冲着腦府。那時，纔把吾已失去的靈覺追了回來。</p>
<p>時間是在一個晚上，吾在床上翻了一個身，睜開眼睛來向四下一瞧，竟一切都使吾覺得驚異；房裏，人的面孔全是陌生的，吾壓根兒也不能够認識他們。吾的身邊少了一個媚，母親和弟弟也找不到，待要想開口向睡在另一隻床上的人探問時，但又不敢；所以，幾次要想吐出口來的一句話，終於把它嚥進了肚裏，自己的心裏，却着實有些煩悶！</p>
<p>房的中央，那盞十支光的電燈，發出它幽默的光芒，那光芒是慘澹得沒有一絲力量，它正如床上的病人一樣。</p>
<p>門外的甬道中，發出淸脆的，節奏的步調；陣陣地從外面送進來，接着房門開處，走進了一位素衣姑娘，托了一隻盤，笑盈盈的挨近了床前，把盤望小方几上一擱；首先，便給吾診了脈，量了寒熱。隨後，挨着各人都一樣的診脈，量寒熱。</p>
<p>「大便怎樣？睡得着嗎？」每個人都要照例地這樣問一句：</p>
<p>騐大便，騐小便，騐血，騐痰，這是每一個病人到了醫院裏，都必須經過的最初手續。</p>
<p>老蘇和老李已經住在這裏半年多了，從前住的是二等病房，後來因爲經濟關係，所以才搬進這三等病房裏來的。</p>
<p>據他們說：從前每夜都聯絡了値夜的看護，偷偷地跑出去看電影，開旅館賭錢的。其實，他們的病早就好了，但是，爲了自己不愛惜自己的身體一，因此現在更壞了，而且毛病也比以前利害！</p>
<p>他們現在可不能那樣自由了。這，因爲三等病房裏的待遇，當然比不上頭等，二等那樣好；現在，他們吃過晚飯，接了到禮拜堂裏去聽一回耶穌外；回來睡不着覺，便拉開了喉嚨講山海經，「江湖奇俠傳」「今古奇觀」「：：：」等，就是他們最好的資料。不過，喉嚨却要壓得特別低，假使響了，便會影響到別人的睡眠，而要受着看護們干涉的。可是吾因此倒也不覺得十分寂寞。</p>
<p>日間，上午九時至十二時是最好安息的時間。一天要量三次寒熱，診三次脈，及吃三次藥水，一切生活都是機械化的。午飯後要洗澡擦身，俟這些事情過去，便凖備伸長了𩓐子，盼望親戚朋友，家人來探望。</p>
<p>每到探病時間，電梯上就擠滿了探望病人的人。尤其是吾，每逢有人來探望吾的時候，總是依依不捨的要呌他們多坐一回的，等到他們走了，便怔怔地望着那扇門發𪳯，一時悵惘地悲哀起來！</p>
<p>這情形，彷彿似監牢裏的犯人，希望熟人去探視他一個樣子。</p>
<p>吾住在××醫院裏才一個多月；然而，幾乎把吾整個的靈魂都摧殘了，活躍的生命也灼死了。雖然，幾位素衣姑娘的笑　和慰問，是値得留戀的；但，終不能够消除了吾的煩悶，和掩蓋不住吾的悲愁！所以終於等不到病愈，便推故脫離了那三等病房，而跑到鄕村裏去休養。</p>
<p>鄕村裏有幽靜的環境，淸新的空氣，是最適宜于病人休養的地方。况且，吾是個生性好動不好靜的「野孩子」，像醫院裏那樣不能越電池一步地把吾關在那無罪的監獄！病房裏，簡直要把吾窒息死啦！</p>
<p>可是，當吾離開了那可愛的素衣姑娘，而跨上滬杭車時，還回頭望着那醫院的屋頂，低低地喊了一聲：「別矣！吾可愛的素衣姑娘呵！」</p>
<h3 id="c262">沒出息的兒子 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 寒白</p>
<p>父親那一付幽暗而蒼老的臉，近來愈顯得陰沉了！</p>
<p>辛勤而樸實的父親，把他從一滴血，一滴汗的勞働中所爭取得來底收穫，僅餘的財富，積集着，儲蓄着，全給他的兒子，送進商品式的大學。</p>
<p>他丨丨父親忍受着一切的痛苦，一切的侮辱與譏笑，在嚴寒的冬天，人家都穿嶄新的皮袍，而他還是一件土布的棉袍；在炎熱的夏天，人家都穿着柔軟而輕飄的夏衣，而他還是穿着一身厚重的布衣。然而在外式上看起來，他是永遠那麽地快樂，歡娛，因爲他一身的鄭岱鶴先生作品</p>
<p>幸福，希望，安慰統統寄托在他兒子的前途上。</p>
<p>他希望他的兒子學成以後，就能做起大官來，至少能賺大錢，藉以補償他從前所支出的代價，能呼吸一口自由的空氣，在人們面前，顯顯自己的威風，畢竟他過去的忍耐，是有酬報的。</p>
<p>可是他的兒子，不能酬償他的熱烈的願望。他的兒子，離開了文憑交易所的大學，整整地快要兩年了，依然是他以前的兒子，所不同的，是臉孔蒼老些；鬍鬚叢多些。飄泊，浪流，於繁華的都巿，被擯棄於現社會的鐵圈以外。他沒有學得做官的藝術，賺錢的技倆；更沒有權威的親戚，鑽營的金錢。這樣他就永遠不能交着現社會的官運，儘管他的父親是如何地誇耀着他的兒子的命運是如何高貴，結果，是祇有使他失望了！</p>
<p>因爲他的兒子，是一個不平凡的兒子，（當然，在他父親說來，是一個沒出息的兒子）是一個富有理智的兒子。他何嘗不知道他的父親是如何熱望着他能榮宗耀祖；他又何嘗不知道他的父親是如何爭取得來的錢供給他去讀書，也許他比他的父親更明白這些問題。他深知用以作爲交換商品尺度的金錢，可以奴隸，蹂躪一切人，可是他從未想作金錢的俘虜，而相反地是想毀滅足以奴隸人的金錢，他忘記了一切疲倦，理智地，沉痛地過度他堅苦的生活。他認爲家庭是局部的問題，個人主義的渣滓是應該先從家庭方面肅淸的。</p>
<p>而他的父親呢？是已被時代的車輪捨棄得老遠了！他受了封建社會的遺毒是太深刻了！要是全人類的意識，都和他的父親一樣，那末現社會的構機，是定然安定得像泰山，在皇宮裏，舞廳裏的人們，得永遠可以恬靜地做着憇密的美夢，享受着唯一的尊榮。</p>
<p>居在這極端相反的兩個世界裏的人物，自然他的父親，祇有帶着失望的眼，長吁着，咆哮着，呌駡他的兒子是一個沒有出息的兒子了！</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>前不多時看見時事新報，登着金箭筆頭贈送樣品的廣告，說得它精良，優美，任何筆頭都趕不上。無論寫中西文字，總不會戮破紙頭。並有樣劵登在報上，劵上說：「將劵剪下寫上寄劵人住址姓名及郵票十分樣劵一張，寄往郵政信箱一五六七號。接到後卽直接奉上」。但過了好幾天，影踪全無，一點消息也沒有。近來我又寫了一封信給他，問他可收到沒有，但至今並無信息這十分郵票倒是小事，不過我莫名其妙他們究竟幹什麽把戲，請先生給我解决這個問題吧？此頌</p>
<p>撰安胡刋謹上</p>
<p>答：你所問的問題，內容究竟如何，我不知道。這個贈送樣品的廣告，在報紙上可登有牌號，公司的地址麽？如無，就有點可疑了。依我猜想，你寄去樣劵，影踪全無，大約不外乎三個原因，第一，信沒有遞到，第二，該店辦事遲緩，樣品還未寄出，第三，就是欺騙詐財。你旣將地址記得這樣淸楚，諒無郵遞不到之理，况且寄去也過好些天，辦事無論如何慢　，也總該有回答。所以你這次寄去郵票函索筆頭大約是上當的成分居多了。現在這種以「附郵幾分，當卽函奉」吸引讀者購買的廣告，有許多都是招搖撞騙，所以，我們對於沒有登載公司各號，地址的正式廣告，僅書投函某某郵箱者，實在不可完全憑信，世界上沒有便宜事，貪小便宜，最是容易上當的。編者</p>

<h3 id="e1">Announcement from the Beining Railway Bureau: Ping-Shen Railway Through-Service Arrangements to Commence on July 1st, with One Daily Round Trip, Managed by the Oriental Travel Agency <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Ping-Shen through-service arrangements were announced at 8:00 AM on the 28th. The original text is as follows: Notification from the Beining Railway Administration: Regarding the matter of through passenger trains between within and outside the [Great] Wall, the Executive Yuan's Political Reorganization Committee stationed in Beiping previously forwarded an order from the Executive Yuan, based on the standard procedures approved by the President of the Executive Yuan and the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, to negotiate with Japanese representatives. Following these instructions, negotiations were conducted and specific arrangements were agreed upon, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and record. It is now decided to implement these arrangements starting July 1st. The arrangements are announced as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Starting from July 1st of this year, through passenger trains from Beiping to Liaoning will be restored, limited to one round trip between Beiping and Shenyang daily.</p>
<p>(2) The Chinese side will task the China Travel Service, and the Japanese side will task the Japan Tourist Bureau, to establish the Oriental Travel Agency at Shanhaiguan. This agency will be responsible for managing the through-service transportation matters.</p>
<p>(3) All regulations regarding train operations, timetables, rolling stock composition, ticket sales, and other procedures will be separately stipulated by this Bureau. Director Yin Tong, June 28th, 23rd year of the Republic of China. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Ping-Shen through-service plan was announced by both Chinese and Japanese sides this morning, bringing this matter to a conclusion. All that remains is for the trains to begin running. The trains prepared by our side will be brought to Beiping for readiness once the train schedule is finalized. Zhang Shuiqi, the General Manager of the Oriental Travel Agency, along with Zhang Shizhong, Hu Shiyuan, and others, after going to Yushuguan, have already located the agency's address and signed a contract with representatives of the Japan Tourist Bureau. They left Yushuguan on the 28th and arrived in Tianjin to continue discussing the train schedule with the Beining Railway Bureau and Japanese representatives. A decision is expected today. Whether ticket revenue will be settled by the railway bureaus inside and outside the [Great] Wall separately or cleared together is also pending a decision in Tianjin. Chen Xiangtao, the manager of the China Travel Service, is in Tianjin to participate and will return to Shanghai shortly. The train tickets will be sent to Beiping today or tomorrow. The service personnel for the China Travel Service branch on the section inside the [Great] Wall have been appointed, totaling fourteen people in three shifts, including three train conductors, ticket inspectors, and car guards. The train conductors are Pang Jiatai, Zhou Dechang, and Chen Tiqiang. Yin Tong, due to ongoing discussions in Tianjin regarding unfinished through-service matters, specially dispatched Wu Banhua to bring the Beining Railway Bureau's notification and detailed rules of the through-service plan to Beiping that night. The announcement was made at 8:00 AM this morning in the Director's office at the East Railway Station. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The trains operating at that time will only display a white wooden sign reading "Beiping to Shenyang Special Express." No symbols will be painted on the train. There will be no ceremony when the train departs. During the train's journey on the Ping-Yu section, Huang Haiquan, the Director of the Beining Police Department, will assign twenty armed police officers to protect the train. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Oriental Travel Agency will only have dealings with the Beining Railway Bureau, the Japan Tourist Bureau, and the South Manchuria Railway. It will not handle negotiations with any other third parties. The agency's capital is set at one million yuan, with the China Travel Service and the Japan International Tourist Bureau each contributing half. Both sides will designate a bank to deposit the funds as security for the train's safety. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, when the Ping-Shen through-service train arrives at the Yushuguan station, passengers will only be subject to legitimate inspections under Chinese law; everything else can be ignored. However, if passengers do not take the through-service train to Yushuguan but instead take a "pseudo-Fengshan" train from Yushuguan out of the [Great] Wall, that is a separate issue. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The detailed through-service rules announced in Beiping were drafted by the Beining Railway Bureau for the Oriental Travel Agency, instructing the agency to operate within the scope of those rules. There are two other documents regarding the exchange of notes between China and Japan and the through-service agreement, which are held by the China Travel Service, the International Tourist Bureau, and the Chinese and Japanese authorities. These documents are absolutely confidential and will not be published. The organization of the Oriental Travel Agency is also included in the agreement. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Travel Agency Contract Signed <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Oriental Travel Agency contract was signed on the evening of the 27th by Zhang Shuiqi of the China Travel Service and Adachi, a representative of the Japan Tourist Bureau. Zhang is temporarily unable to leave Yushuguan due to preparations for organizing the agency. Chen Xiangtao is scheduled to go to Tianjin on the evening of the 28th to transfer to a train back to Shanghai. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Through-Service Departure Times <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The through-service times have been finalized and will not be included in the train numbers. The train will depart from Beiping at 8:45 AM daily, arriving at Yushuguan at 6:40 PM that day, and reaching Shenyang at 6:35 AM the following morning. The train will depart from Shenyang at 10:15 AM daily, arriving at Yushuguan at 9:26 PM that evening, and reaching Beiping at 9:18 AM the following morning. The Oriental Travel Agency will be established in Yushuguan by the 30th, with the address already secured near the station's hotel. General Manager Zhang Shuiqi will travel to Yushuguan tonight. He will begin operations after the Japanese Deputy General Manager, Hirayama, arrives. Hirayama is a senior employee of the South Manchuria Railway and is being transferred from the Japan International Tourist Bureau. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Beining Railway Bureau Notification to All Stations Along the Line <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beining Railway Bureau's order notifying all stations along the line was originally scheduled to be issued at 10:00 AM this morning. However, due to delays in transmission, it was not fully issued until 3:00 PM this afternoon. The timetable will still use the morning time. The original text is as follows: Beining Railway Administration Telegram, June 28th, 23rd year of the Republic of China, 10:15 AM, Bureau Order No. 403. All departments, offices, factories, institutes, schools, sections, teams, and stations are to examine. The through-service event on this railway inside and outside the [Great] Wall has been approved by the Executive Yuan and announced today. Through-service will be implemented on July 1st. This case is the focus of attention both within and outside the country, and is of extraordinary importance. The date of the commencement of the through-service is fast approaching. It is hereby ordered that all employees, both internal and external, and police officers, should diligently attend to their duties and avoid any negligence. Bureau Management Seal. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to outside sources, Yin Tong arrived at the Beining Railway Bureau this morning to deliver instructions to the staff regarding the Ping-Shen through-service. The gist of his remarks was that the Ping-Shen through-service is a technical issue within the Tanggu Truce Agreement and was mentioned as early as last October. However, due to various circumstances, it was delayed until now. Currently, following the principles of the Universal Postal Union Conference's resolution on the postal arrangements with the "pseudo-state," the two countries' commercial organizations have jointly established the Oriental Travel Agency to be responsible for handling the through-service. This is purely commercial in nature and has no connection with political aspects or the issue of recognizing the "pseudo-organization." (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Subject to Inspection When Passing Through Yushuguan <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Ping-Shen special train will stop at Yushuguan station for one hour for local police, military police, and customs to inspect travelers and their luggage. Since the Incident, other entities, such as the Public Security Bureau police, have been unable to perform their duties at the station. All those active at the station are "pseudo-police." Therefore, passengers passing through Yushuguan in the future will inevitably be inspected solely by "pseudo-police." Yushuguan station has been set up with many passenger seats to be used during inspections. The South Manchuria Railway Company has prepared two trains, each with a total of ten cars. The train service personnel are all Japanese. They are currently preparing everything in Yushuguan. Due to the lack of passenger ticket blanks at various stations along the line, ticket sales have been rescheduled to begin on the 30th. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Yin Tong Discusses His Feelings About the Negotiations <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) This afternoon, reporters interviewed Yin Tong at the Ning Garden, asking about his feelings regarding the handling of the through-service event. Yin said that difficulties were felt both internally and externally in carrying out this matter. As for whether the ceasefire agreement will be abolished, it is not yet known. However, through-service must be viewed as one matter, and abolishing the Tanggu Truce Agreement is another matter. Regarding the entry of the newly formed special police force of the war zone, negotiations with the Japanese side must take place after Chairman Huang returns. Originally, the linking of train services had already been in contact before the through-service. This through-service mainly means that passengers do not have to change trains. Therefore, the use of the word "through" [通] at this time already feels awkward. Zhang Shuiqi said that the Oriental Travel Agency will not establish branches in places such as Beiping and Tianjin, only in Yushuguan. Passenger tickets will be sold by major stations on behalf of the agency. Everything is ready, and the first through-service is scheduled to commence on July 1st. China Travel Service is a business organization, and it will operate the Oriental Travel Agency in the same way. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Chibayama Issues Statement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, Chiba-yama issued a written statement in English and the through-service arrangements in the military attaché's office at the Japanese Embassy. The translation is recorded as follows: It is fortunate for both China and Japan that the through-service problem has been resolved satisfactorily today. This problem was a local and technical one and should have been resolved earlier. However, due to various difficulties, it was delayed until now. I do not wish to say anything more today. However, I sincerely hope that the resolution of this matter will prove that Sino-Japanese relations are becoming more friendly and close. Therefore, I sincerely congratulate the restoration of through-service. Through-service arrangements: (1) After careful consideration by the responsible authorities of both China and Japan, it was agreed that starting July 1st, under the management of the Oriental Travel Agency established in Yushuguan, one train will run daily between Beiping and Shenyang. (2) The Oriental Travel Agency will be responsible for handling all through-service matters. (3) The railway authorities will separately announce the timetable, train composition, transportation of passenger luggage, and ticket sales. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Passenger Notices <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) In addition to the through-service arrangements, the document released by the Beining Railway Bureau on the morning of the 28th also included passenger notices, which are divided into the following: (1) Train Composition: "Within the [Great] Wall section": Locomotive, postal car, four third-class passenger cars, one first-class dining car, one second-class passenger car, one first-class sleeping car, one baggage car, and one guard car. "Outside the [Great] Wall section": Locomotive, one guard car, one baggage car, four third-class passenger cars, one first-class dining car, one third-class sleeping car, one first-class sleeping car, and one observation car. The above includes a total of nine cars [within the Wall] and ten cars [outside the Wall] excluding the postal car. The equipment prepared within the [Great] Wall consists of nine cars per set excluding the postal car. The equipment prepared outside the [Great] Wall consists of ten cars per set. However, adjustments can be made if there is a need to increase or decrease the number of cars. The railway reserves the right to increase the number of cars at any time if required for transportation needs within Shanhaiguan. (2) Dining Car Matters: The menu used in the dining car on the Ping-Yu section should be labeled "Beiping to Shenyang Special Express," and the menu used in the Yu-Shen section should be labeled "Shenyang to Beiping Special Express." However, meal prices will be consistent both inside and outside the [Great] Wall. (3) Ticket Sales Stations: The designated ticket sales stations are as follows: Beiping, Langfang, Tianjin Main Station, Tianjin East Station, Tanggu, Lutai, Tangshan, Kaiping, Guye, Luanxian, Changli, Beidaihe, Haibin, Qinhuangdao, Shanhaiguan, Qiansuo, Suizhong, Xingcheng, Lianshan, Jinxian, Dalinghe, Goubangzi, Dahushan, Raoyanghe, Xinmin, Juliuhe, Huanggu-tun, Shenyang, Shenyang Main Station. (4) Passenger Tickets: The types of tickets sold are divided into three categories: one-way, group, and discounted group tickets. Each ticket has three sections: the first section is from the starting station to Shanhaiguan, the second section is from Shanhaiguan to the destination station, and the third section is the stub. (5) Berth Fares: Inside the [Great] Wall section: First class upper berth 4 yuan, lower berth 5 yuan. Outside the [Great] Wall section: First class upper berth 5 yuan, lower berth 7 yuan; second class upper berth 3 yuan, lower berth 4.5 yuan. (6) Passenger Ticket Validity Period: One-way tickets are valid for seven days regardless of distance, and round-trip tickets are valid for fifteen days regardless of distance. (7) Luggage Transportation: Free luggage allowance: First class 80 kg, second class 60 kg, third class 40 kg, the same both inside and outside the [Great] Wall.

<p>(Tianjin) Our side has decided to establish a Customs Office in Shanhaiguan after the through-service is realized.

<p>(Nanjing) According to Reuters, during his visit to Nanjing, Ariyoshi thanked Wang Jingwei regarding the Zangben Incident and exchanged views on Sino-Japanese diplomacy.

It is said that the Japanese side's negotiation plan towards us is to first negotiate a Sino-Japanese commercial treaty, as well as settling old debts. Ariyoshi has drafted an outline of the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty based on instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with the aim of mutual benefit and tariff reductions. The Japanese side has expressed a willingness to make concessions on the issue of extraterritoriality in the commercial treaty. Its main objective is to lower tariffs on Japanese goods and restore business trade in China. As for the recovery of water rights, the Japanese naval authorities have objected. Ariyoshi ordered Suma to visit the Ministry of Transportation to express his disagreement. Ariyoshi also expressed his opposition during his visit to Nanjing.

<p>(Beiping) Finance Minister Kong hosted representatives of various industries and businesses in Beiping City at his residence at 4:00 PM on the 26th, with more than 100 people in attendance. Kong gave a speech, saying that everyone has a deep hope for the elimination of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. However, national laws must go through legal procedures and cannot be implemented based on an individual's promise. The decisions made at financial conferences often await review and approval by the Legislative Yuan. He hopes that everyone understands the laws and does not press too hard. Beiping was the capital of past dynasties. In the autocratic era, the wealth of the world was used to meet the needs of one person. Therefore, wealthy merchants and major businesses gathered here. After the capital moved south, they dispersed accordingly. However, its magnificence and grandeur are still admired by people at home and abroad. If it is diligently managed, it can still flourish. However, the previous government was excessively demanding of the people, and Chongguan was one example. However, it was repealed with his approval, which shows that the National Government is always concerned about the people's difficulties. Now that the country is facing many challenges and taxes are heavy, citizens have both rights and obligations to the country. He hopes that everyone can work hard to overcome the difficulties. The internal chaos has been quelled, the Red bandits have disappeared, and there are solutions to the external troubles. The national situation is gradually becoming consolidated. Therefore, the government has decided to eliminate harsh and miscellaneous taxes and reduce surcharges on land taxes. In the future, finances will be used for construction, with the aim of developing industry and revitalizing the countryside. He hopes that everyone pays attention to the outflow of interests and business ethics, and seeks to make operations more scientific and economical, so as to be able to resist foreign competition. In addition, business people very much hope for a clean government and honest officials. However, business people often give government employees the opportunity to be corrupt. For example, there are often inflated prices in the receipts issued and the prices of goods sold. This results in losses to the government and no gains for the business people. In the end, it is still the people who pay for it through taxes. Therefore, if you want the government to be clean and the officials to be honest, business people must first have a spirit of honesty. After Kong's speech, a representative from the business community gave a reply. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e23">On the Prohibition of Prize-Linked Savings <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>On the 22nd of this month, the Legislative Yuan revised and passed the Draft Savings Bank Law, stipulating in Article 14 of the seventeen articles that "Prize-linked savings should be prohibited. The methods for concluding existing prize-linked savings deposits before the implementation of this law shall be drafted by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval." Prize-linked savings have been criticized by insightful people for many years. The reason why the government has only explicitly banned it today is not due to a single cause. Although the government is determined to implement the prohibition, observing the future, there are many obstacles, and it is inevitable that it will be obstructed by powerful people, leading to failure. During the years of the Republic of China 8 and 9, the operation of prize-linked savings in our country reached a peak. Later, the inside story was revealed, credit declined, and even many went bankrupt. The government authorities even issued a strict prohibition. Unexpectedly, with the passage of time, this trend revived. In recent years, many domestic and foreign financial institutions have reaped unexpected benefits by operating prize-linked savings. However, the development rate of legitimate savings businesses has been relatively inferior. (According to the establishment of savings institutions in our country for nearly 30 years, the national postal savings in 1932 was only 26 million yuan, and the savings of 23 ordinary banks was only 25 million yuan, totaling no more than 30 million yuan. In contrast, Japan, with a population of 70 million, had postal savings of over 2.8 billion yen in 1932, and ordinary bank savings of over 1.7 billion yen, totaling 4.5 billion. Comparing with our country, we are far behind.) To seek the development of legitimate savings businesses, it is impossible to succeed without banning prize-linked savings. This is because the nation's funds are limited, and the use and distribution of funds that are abundant in this area must be frugal in that area. Currently, among the institutions specializing in prize-linked savings, in addition to the Savings Department of the China Industrial Bank, which has stopped opening new accounts, the Universal Savings Society is the giant. Next is the Sino-French Savings Society. It is said that the Universal Savings Society has a total of 300,000 to 400,000 depositors, a monthly income of nearly 2 million yuan in cash, and an annual net increase in deposits of 20 million yuan. The total amount of existing savings is 65 million yuan. Its power is astonishing and rare in Shanghai's financial industry. Using such a large amount of cash every month for manipulation and utilization by non-nationals is no small matter.</p>
<p>The development of prize-linked savings is roughly as described above. Examining the reasons for its development, one cannot escape the abundance of floating capital in cities, and the psychology of general depositors to covet bonuses is also related. In recent years, the domestic rural economy has been in a state of bankruptcy, and capital outflow is continuous, causing the deposits and cash in major trading ports such as Shanghai to show an extreme expansion. Looking at the time of the September 18th Incident, the silver reserves in this port were only 30 million yuan, but now they have reached as much as 60 million yuan. However, general corporate investments in cities also suffer from the problem of declining profits. As a result, surplus funds lack proper channels for discharge, and the psychology of speculation and luck increases with panic. The result is gambling-natured operations, such as horse racing, dog racing, and prize-linked savings, creating opportunities for taking advantage of the situation to collect funds and prevailing in Shanghai. Unfortunately, those with simple minds are harmed by it without even realizing it.</p>
<p>From this point of view, there is no doubt about the urgent need to ban prize-linked savings. Now that the Savings Bank Law passed by the Legislative Yuan is said to be implemented at the beginning of July, the prohibition of prize-linked savings is a matter of time. Recently, the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Citizens, and the General Labor Union have all expressed their request for prohibition, as a support for the Legislative Yuan. However, those foreigners who are engaged in this business will definitely do their best to struggle in the future. How this matter will turn out depends on the willpower of the authorities. What we should pay more attention to is how to protect the interests of depositors. It is still necessary to plan carefully. This is also a way to plan for everything.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The new import tariff rates of the customs have been drafted by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the central government for approval. It will be announced by the National Government and implemented on July 1st. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance will order the Director-General of Customs to comply with these tariff rates. This new tariff rate pays close attention to international trade. Regarding the protection of domestic products, careful regulations have been made in the export tariff case. Therefore, the authorities believe that the reduction in import tariff rates will not have any impact on the sales of domestic products. Furthermore, at the routine meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 29th, a report on this case will be presented. Roughly, the tariff rates can be discussed and other opinions can be presented for central government reference. (Special dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Finance, the newly revised customs import tariff is said to be announced and implemented soon. Furthermore, the 5% surcharge levied by the customs on import and export tariffs is about to expire. The Ministry of Finance, according to the order of the National Government, will continue to levy the customs surcharge for another year from July 1st, and ordered the customs supervisors to comply.

<h3 id="e29">British Defense Mega-Plan Emphasizes Strengthening the Air Force, Aiming to Complete Within Ten Years; Seeks Close Liaison with Territories; Unwilling to Lag Behind in the Arms Race <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(London) Following yesterday's cabinet meeting, according to sources in diplomatic circles today, Britain's plan to expand its air force is about to mature rapidly. The rumor that the government will submit a huge supplementary budget for the air force to Parliament next week, which was circulated yesterday morning, has been denied by reliable sources this morning. However, it is indeed expected that a supplementary budget will be submitted before the House adjourns next month. According to well-informed sources, the air force expansion plan will increase the budget by a much higher amount than that proposed by the army and navy. It has long been rumored that the British government intends to double the air force strength of the army and navy within five years. Today, this seems to be confirmed. However, some parties say that the expansion period is seven or ten years rather than five years. However, it is already obvious that this expansion plan has matured. The government and influential newspapers such as the Daily Mail, the Daily Express, and the Evening Standard have all made the public understand the necessity of air defense preparations, and the whole country must work together to contribute to promoting this move. According to experts, if Britain doubles its air force, including flight personnel and airports, it will cost 25 million pounds. Therefore, the government has decided to implement it with a long-term plan. If the government completes this move within one year, it must increase taxes. This kind of adventurous move is not dare to be done by the current cabinet, and government officials also believe that there is no danger of war at present, so it is okay to proceed gradually, so that the British air force, which is currently ranked sixth in the world, gradually becomes equal to the air force strength of other European countries. Generally, Britain may first slightly reveal its intention to expand, so that France and Germany can see that the air force competition will tend to extremes, or may finally comply with Britain's intention and establish a treaty restricting international air forces. This treaty is now opposed by France. The Disarmament Conference has repeatedly been on the verge of collapse, and the air force agreement proposed by Britain is the last effort to save it. If it cannot succeed, Britain will expand its existing 1,500 aircraft to 3,000 aircraft to be equal to France. The plan announced by the government is that the British air force must be equal to the country with the strongest air force within striking distance. Everyone knows that the German air force can already compete with France, and it is rumored that it is still expanding secretly, so Britain has to catch up urgently. As for the United States, Britain feels even more inferior when compared with it. This is also an important reason why those who advocate expanding the air force see it.

<p>(London) British Secretary of State for Air Londonderry stated in the House of Lords today the British government's resolution to have an air force equal to that of other countries in the world in a short period of time. His statement was roughly the same as that made by Lord Privy Seal Baldwin recently. The Secretary of State for Air's remarks were in response to a question from Lord Mottistone, who said that British air defenses were weak and should be remedied. The Secretary of State for Air replied that it was almost hopeless to obtain an international convention to solve this problem in Europe, so the British government decided not to delay any longer and immediately take the necessary steps to make British air defenses perfect. As for the details of how the air force will be expanded, it is not convenient to publish them at present, but there is no need to worry. The plan and methods for expanding the air force are now fully underway. The Secretary of State for Air also answered a question from Lord Elibank, saying that the self-governing territories and the British government both feel that the plan to establish a centralized air force in the British Empire is not in line with the autonomy of all parties, but they are now trying to make the air forces in all parts of the British Empire closely linked within the possible scope.

<p>(Washington) The unofficial reaction here to the British shipbuilding program is growing, and everyone thinks that the program is a legitimate action. However, those who hope that next year's conference can obtain a real naval disarmament result are inevitably disappointed. The naval expansion program in London seems unreasonable at first glance, but it seems otherwise due to the following factors: The collapse of the Geneva Disarmament Conference, the ship-increasing program of Italy and France, and Japan's request for equality all make Britain deeply believe in the importance of prevention and are eager to consolidate its naval position. Some people think that the British program is actually running parallel to the US shipbuilding program. Now the US has decided to expand its navy to the extent permitted by the treaty, and has approved the construction of as many as 50 warships. Some people think that the British program, at least in part, is to consolidate its position at the opening of next year's naval conference, so that it can have something to rely on when negotiating.

The Turkish Interior Minister said in a speech at the banquet, "Our friendship with this great neighboring country is one of the basic principles of the policy implemented by our government. To be precise, the policy of mutual trust built and implemented by our two governments in the past and the future is based on this."

<p>(London) Chinese Minister to the United States, Shi Zhaoji, arrived here today because his son is scheduled to marry the daughter of Shanghai banker Li Ming on July 7. A reporter from the North China Daily News went to interview him. According to Minister Shi, although the United States is now busy dealing with domestic political issues, it is still very cautious in paying attention to the overall situation in the Far East and has extremely serious views on its possibilities. There is no doubt about this. The United States is eager to cooperate with the United Kingdom in the Far East, but the British policy seems to be quite hesitant. Many Americans are now particularly worried that the United Kingdom still has a strong political party advocating the restoration of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Minister Shi also said that it is impossible to discuss the 1935 naval conference without discussing political issues. The disarmament issue cannot be discussed without politics. The United Kingdom is now inviting the great powers to participate in this naval conference more than the last Washington conference, so the United States has not yet formally put forward its agenda. He believes that the United States will put it forward informally and believes that the conference will thoroughly discuss the overall situation in the Far East on various opinions. The United States' policy in the Far East will never be affected by the documents exchanged between Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on March 21. One important point that has not been noticed is that Japan once tried to make a special convention with the United States. The United States replied that any convention should allow the countries in the Far East to join, including China, Russia, Japan, and the United States. Minister Shi ridiculed the claim that the United States would buy 100 million ounces of silver in the next six months, saying that the power to purchase silver is now in the hands of President Roosevelt. Roosevelt must be very cautious and not disturb the market with shocking purchases. (Special dispatch from the North China Daily News on the 27th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) On the 11th of this month, the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference established four committees in accordance with the compromise plan proposed by Barthou to study separately: 1. Security, 2. Supervision, 3. Aviation, 4. Arms Manufacturing and Trafficking. Recently, the first, second, and fourth committees have all met. Today, the subcommittee specializing in the study of arms manufacturing problems of the fourth committee held another meeting. The chairman, the Polish representative, presented a draft to the subcommittee, which only stipulated universal crackdown measures on arms manufacturing, but advocated that both state-owned and private manufacturing should be cracked down on equally. The draft, on the one hand, advocated the adoption of a comprehensive supervisory system domestically, and on the other hand, set up supervisory methods internationally, but what was proposed was only a supervision outline, and the detailed methods will be discussed later. Today, the proposer, the Polish representative, explained the reason, saying that according to the new principle, all countries should bear responsibilities within the scope of the international disarmament convention, and the draft he proposed is a practical way to implement this new principle. After consideration by the subcommittee, the draft will be sent to the governments of the countries concerned for review. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)</p>

<p>(Washington) British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, has today sent the British government's reply to the US Secretary of State Hull regarding the repayment of debt with goods. The reply stated that the experience of Germany repaying debt with goods has shown that replacing cash with goods still cannot avoid the difficulty of unlocking funds. The United Kingdom believes that after the repayment of debt with goods, the US exports to the United Kingdom will be greatly damaged, and if the goods sold by the United Kingdom in the United States cannot recover cash, then the United Kingdom's ability to purchase US cotton and other goods will be further reduced. Therefore, although the British government is willing to continue discussing the debt issue, it feels that the plan proposed by the United States is not feasible. The reply continued that the difficulty of repaying debt with goods is equal to that of repaying debt with cash, unless these goods are produced in the debtor country and the creditor country accepts them in addition to the original import. As for the final section of the reply, the United Kingdom expressed in a friendly tone that the crux of the war debt issue lies in the number. The reply said, "In view of the various circumstances related to this debt, the British government is very willing to re-discuss it after the current abnormal state is improved, so that a solution can be obtained, because the United Kingdom is also eager to remove the source of the dispute as soon as possible, so as not to hinder harmonious relations."

<p>(London) The Anglo-French trade war will end on Sunday, and if the negotiations between Britain and Germany are not smooth, the two countries will start a trade war on that day. Representatives of Britain and France signed an agreement here today to end the commercial dispute between the two countries. The agreement will take effect from Sunday. The two countries will cancel the allocation and retaliatory tariffs. Before June 10, the treaty was in draft. On June 10, it was announced that the trade agreement had been concluded. The two countries abolished retaliatory measures and mutually granted the most-favored-nation tariff and other commercial terms to each other. (National News Agency dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The Anglo-French trade agreement was officially signed at 5 pm. The following is a record of the negotiations between the two countries: Since the devaluation of the British pound, France, in order to prevent the dumping of British goods, imposed an exchange rate adjustment surcharge of 15% on British goods and restricted the quantity of British goods imported. Although this tariff rate was cancelled from January 1st of this year, France reduced the quota for British goods imported by 75%. The United Kingdom's negotiations were ineffective, so in February, it imposed an additional tariff of 21% on certain French goods in retaliation. As a result, France also announced the abolition of the Anglo-French Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1882. Later, the governments of the two countries, in view of the fact that mutual retaliation was not a good strategy, held trade negotiations in March. The negotiations were once interrupted, but they restarted at the beginning of this month. The negotiations were concluded on the 16th, and the trade agreement was initialed on that day.

<p>(Washington) The U.S. government's decision to begin purchasing large quantities of silver, absorbing 135.4 million ounces within six months, has attracted attention everywhere. However, Treasury Department officials are unwilling to discuss the silver issue. Although the Treasury Department currently has the authority to purchase over 100 million ounces of silver, whether it will purchase such a large amount had not been definitively decided as of last month. Treasury Department officials are unwilling to comment on Representative Dies' statement yesterday that the Treasury Department has already purchased 75 million ounces of silver. In short, the Treasury Department is unwilling to disclose the amount of silver it has purchased. It is understood that the funds for purchasing the silver are mostly allocated from the Exchange Equalization Fund, so the quantity is not recorded in the Treasury Department's daily report. The Treasury Department now plans to purchase silver from ordinary expenses in the future. If so, the amount of silver purchased will be visible in the central government's daily reports.

<p>(Berlin) Today is the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. All German public and private institutions are flying flags at half-mast to mark the shame. This is not only a clear expression of the German government's aversion to the Treaty of Versailles, but also a symbol of the painful feelings of the German people. Some morning newspapers used black borders, reminding people of the humiliating and miserable scene when Germany was forced to sign the treaty fifteen years ago. It is said that the treaty not only failed to bring peace to Europe and the world, but instead brought the opposite disaster. (National News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today is the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and also the 20th anniversary of the Sarajevo Incident (a place name, formerly part of the Austrian province of Bosnia, now ceded to Yugoslavia. On June 28, 1914, a Serbian student, Princip, assassinated the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in that location, triggering the outbreak of the European War). The newspapers in the German capital have written extensively about it, especially expressing dissatisfaction with the so-called "humiliating treaty" of Versailles, stating that the Treaty of Versailles is not another name for peace, and fiercely criticizing the Allied countries, especially France. The Berlin Stock Exchange News stated that the Treaty of Versailles was a fraudulent act of coercion during Germany's exhaustion and should not be regarded as a treaty. The Berlin Morning News asked, "Today, the whole country</p>
<p>flies flags at half-mast, to protest the Allied countries' use of violence and coercion, and as a symbol of the struggle for honorable peace and equal rights." In addition, the German Public Organizations Joint Committee issued a declaration opposing Germany's current borders, stating that they are "contrary to common sense." The association also expressed resistance to the various countries' deprivation of German colonies, stating that this kind of deprivation action "reduces the land crucial to the survival of the German nation," which is intolerable.

<p>(Berlin) Recently, there have been many speculations about Prime Minister Hitler and Propaganda Minister Goebbels. Now, I will record two things for your amusement. One day, Hitler visited an astrologer to ask about his fortune. Hitler asked how many years he could still rule Germany. The astrologer told him that there were still thirty years. Hitler replied that it was good, but then who would succeed him? The astrologer replied with Hindenburg. President Hindenburg is already eighty-seven years old and has been in charge of the central government for many years. The Germans worship him like a god. Whether the astrologer's words are credible is debatable. However, in today's Germany, except for those with scientific basis, all astrologers have been banned. This is one thing. People in Berlin can all talk about it. There is also one thing about Propaganda Minister Goebbels. Since Vice Prime Minister von Papen made a sharp criticism of the Nazi Party's maladministration, Propaganda Minister Goebbels has been carrying out a purge of newspapers across the country. The editor of a small newspaper in East Prussia wrote to the Propaganda Minister, saying that the chairman of the National Socialist Party branch in our town gives three lectures every week, and each time he instructs that the full text of his speech be published, along with a photo of himself. This has been done sixty times. If this continues, our newspaper will go out of business, and I will go crazy. It is said that this letter has been effective.

Aviation Minister Goering also gave a speech in Cologne, saying, "The Third Germany sincerely desires religious peace, but the education of young people is the task of the state. The National Socialist Party will never abandon this principle. Anyone who wants to destroy our belief in the Prime Minister should be regarded as a traitor to the party and excluded from society."

<p>(Tokyo) The interim report on the Ministry of Finance case is imminent, so the attitudes of the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are attracting great public attention. Today, Prime Minister Saitō suddenly visited Finance Minister Takahashi at his official residence in Nagatachō at 3:30 p.m. Justice Minister Koyama explained the contents of his report in detail and held important consultations on the attitude and policies that the government should take.

The press corps interviewed the Prime Minister at this time, trying to ask questions, but his answers were not very clear, probably because he was afraid of affecting the political situation, so he denied everything. The situation of the Q&amp;A is recorded below. The reporter asked, "Today, the Prime Minister has met with the Finance Minister. Did he try to persuade Finance Minister Takahashi, who has expressed his intention to resign, to stay?" The Prime Minister replied, "Absolutely not." The reporter asked, "Then will the cabinet decide to resign en masse after waiting for the Justice Minister's report?" The Prime Minister replied, "This matter cannot be decided now." The reporter asked, "Will a meeting of the three elders be convened before or after the regular cabinet meeting tomorrow?" The Prime Minister replied, "I haven't thought about it yet." Finance Minister Takahashi made the following remarks, "Today I met with the Prime Minister and did not discuss anything. If you want to find out the content of this meeting, please look at our faces and make your judgment. Regarding the Ministry of Finance case, Justice Minister Koyama will report in writing, so you can look at the document and wait for his explanation before deciding on an attitude. It is rumored that the Justice Minister's report will be on the 3rd of next month. It is not yet known when." (Japan United News dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e59">Shuntian Steamer Robbers Send Letter to Han Fuju Seeking Clemency, Sun Danlin Describes Escape <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) The robbers of the Shuntian steamer entrusted Sun Danlin to deliver a letter to Han Fuju. The envelope was addressed to Chairman Han Jun of the Shandong Provincial Government. The letter stated, "Respectfully presented to Chairman Han, I humbly submit that the Fishery Joint Association was established in Di and Zhan counties the year before last. Xu Ziping was publicly elected as chairman. Although he had improper conduct in the past, he has reformed himself after being elected as chairman. We were originally law-abiding citizens. To maintain local security and protect our homeland, we served in the Joint Association, bravely fighting the enemy and suppressing bandits, without the slightest concern for our lives. Brigade Commander Zhao Xinde of the 54th Brigade was stationed here. Although the Joint Association was established locally, it was under the command of the 58th Brigade. We absolutely obeyed orders without exception. If Your Excellency does not believe this, you can send someone to thoroughly investigate. We have devoted ourselves to protecting the local area and obeyed Brigade Commander Zhao. We can honestly say that we have done nothing wrong. Later, Xu Ziping was executed, and the Joint Association was completely disbanded. We were fortunate to escape capture. Although we escaped with our lives, we had no money to live on outside and no home to return to, so we were inevitably facing death. After thinking it over again and again, we had no other choice but to kidnap five Englishmen as temporary hostages. We earnestly implore Your Excellency to show us mercy and find a way for us to make a living. We will be forever grateful. We had no choice but to resort to this emergency measure. We humbly beg Your Excellency to be lenient and not punish us. We would be endlessly grateful. Respectfully presented to Chairman Han, humbly kneeling with grievances." It is noted that Xu Ziping was originally a bandit leader who was incorporated into the Joint Association before being executed. Han stated that if the bandits do not hand over the kidnapped Chinese, they will be severely suppressed. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) One of the civilian boats used by the Shuntian steamer robbers arrived at Dagu today. Chinese authorities detained the boat for questioning. If it is confirmed that they are robbers, they will be sent to court for trial. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Sun Danlin arrived in Qingdao from Weihaiwei on the afternoon of the 26th. Mr. Sun told reporters that this robbery was the most unfortunate event he had encountered in his twelve years as an official, and it could be considered just retribution. However, he wondered why the others, who were innocent, had suffered such a great disaster. Moreover, he felt particularly saddened that he had escaped unharmed on the 26th. He then spoke of the harsh treatment by the bandits, stating that he argued that a scholar could be killed but not humiliated. Although the bandits were angry and pointed their guns at him, he was not afraid at all. Later, the bandit leader heard about this and ordered him to be brought over, treating him quite politely. Since he could speak English, he could help with the ransom negotiations. Therefore, he took the opportunity to explain the consequences, saying that this case was a major international incident that the government could not ignore. Furthermore, foreign warships were docked in Yantai and Weihai, and planes would come to bomb them. How would they deal with that? The next day, planes did indeed arrive, and the bandits panicked, realizing that he had not lied. The bandits first fired shots as a warning, which was essentially announcing to everyone that they were robbers. The planes received the signal and flew back and forth, dropping notices demanding the immediate release of the Englishmen, or they would be bombed. The bandits were terrified and first sent him and Nick out by boat, along with a letter asking the British to intercede with the government troops, urging them not to threaten them too much, and requesting that the Shandong provincial government incorporate them. His boat had not gone far when a second boat sped past, heading north, later found to be the boat sending Yamamoto to Tanggu. The third time, they sent out the remaining four Englishmen. The remaining eighteen Chinese were not wealthy. This incident, from all perspectives, was quite suspicious, possibly instigated by someone. He hoped that the authorities would resolve it quickly to prevent future trouble. Finally, he said that he had returned to Weihai to work with Mr. Li Hanping on mining matters, but unexpectedly encountered this incident. He was fortunate to have escaped. He spent three days in Weihai entertaining Chinese and foreign officials, delaying his trip. He arrived in Qingdao yesterday and will travel to Jinan tonight with Mayor Shen to meet with Han. He will then have to go to Beijing to present the details. (28th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e90">Japanese Military's "Who's Who": Predictions of Future Leaders <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Next, let's discuss who will be the next Minister of the Navy. If Minister of the Army Hayashi stays in office, it will likely still be Osumi. But if Ugaki forms a cabinet, the situation might be different, because he was a brave warrior in the blockade of Lushun. When Lushun was blockaded for the third time, he commanded the Busan Maru, but unexpectedly, he survived due to engine trouble. At that time, he wrote a letter in blood to apologize to his superiors. This was the first step in his rise to prominence. Also, when he was young, he had a case of misconduct. Recently, he dismissed Major General Sakano over the Ugaki declaration issue. This shows a lack of internal organization. Although Sakano was too rash, Osumi may have gone too far. If he stays in office, he will inevitably relapse into his old ways, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Currently, there are eight admirals in the Navy: Kato, Yamamoto, Osumi, Kobayashi, Nomura, Nakamura, Suetsugu, and Nagano. Except for Osumi, none of them have experience as Minister of the Navy. If Osumi does not rise again, who among these seven can take on this role? In terms of controlling the entire Navy, Admiral Kato Kanji, the former commander-in-chief of the Navy, is the most suitable. After the death of Marshal Togo, he is the elder statesman of the Navy. Since the London Conference, he has been the chief leader of the hardliners. The civilian faction that opposed him has all fallen, such as Admirals Takedi, Taniguchi, Ambo, Yamanashi, Sakonji, and Terashima. Therefore, in a time of impending crisis, it would be appropriate to appoint him as Minister of the Navy. But whether he is a military administrator is a question. He was originally the commander of the fleet and chief of the naval general staff, so he has no experience in military administration. Therefore, he can only be Minister of the Navy in wartime. If Ugaki forms a cabinet, he will definitely not be able to take the stage. Next, Suetsugu Nobumasa, the commander of the Combined Fleet, who is of the same type as Kato, has also attracted attention, but unfortunately, he has no experience in military administration. He is just a naval officer on the bridge. Others, such as military councilor Yamamoto Ohfuku, is the nephew of Yamamoto Gonnohyoe. He was second in his class at the Naval Academy, with Tsukuto Jiro as the top student, and Osumi was third. Because he is the same type as Kato, he has no connection with the military administration department and has only served as commander of the garrison and fleet. He has not served as director or deputy director in the Ministry of the Navy. Therefore, the only ones who can become Minister of the Navy are Kobayashi and Nomura. Nomura is the most tolerant, knows the world situation well, and has deep insights. He is also a military administrator, but he is often seen as a civilian, so he is only suitable for Minister of the Navy in times of crisis. In addition, he lost his right eye when Shanghai celebrated the Emperor's birthday, which inevitably hinders his duties. Thus, among the admirals, the only one who can serve as Minister of the Navy is thought to be Kobayashi Teizo, because Kobayashi is neither a civilian nor a hardliner, but a neutral talent. His talent, experience, and reputation certainly qualify him to be Minister of the Navy. He has served as a senior aide in the Ministry of the Navy, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, chief attendant at the Geneva Three-Power Conference, commander of the training fleet, Director of the Naval Construction Headquarters, Vice Minister, and Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet. In terms of organizational ability, although he is slightly inferior to Kato, he is still a military administrator. If he does not come forward, then Nakamura Ryosan and Nagano Osami of the same lineage will surely be encouraged to rise.</p>

<p>A Tianjin dispatch states that the Peiping-Shenyang Through-Train Technical Conference has concluded, and through-train service will begin on July 1. Regarding the conference, it is reported that after Shibayama arrived in Tianjin by train on the morning of the 24th, he went to the Beining Railway Bureau Reception Office in the French Concession and met with Chen Xiangtao, manager of the China Travel Service, and his deputy, Zhou Shizhong, who had been invited by Yin Tong. They discussed the through-train issue. At noon that day, Yin Tong hosted a banquet at the reception office for Shibayama and Chen Xiangtao. At 11:00 PM, they gathered at the Beining Railway Bureau's official residence on Haihe Road to discuss the matter. The Beining Railway Bureau was represented by Yin Tong, Chen Qingwen (Chief of the Traffic Department), Xu Ji (Chief of the General Affairs Department), Wang Tianxuan (Chief of the Accounting Department), and Xue Fan (Chief of the Transportation Section). The China Travel Service was represented by Chen Xiangtao, Zhou Shizhong, Hu Shiyuan, and Cai Pingjiu. The Japanese side was represented by Shibayama and Suzuki, the director of the Tianjin branch of the Japan International Tourist Bureau. They studied the detailed rules of operation decided at the Dalian conference one by one, and decided that the Beining Railway, the China Travel Service, and the Japanese side would be responsible. Chen Xiangtao, representing the China Travel Service, then signed the contract. The meeting lasted a very long time, ending at 2:00 AM on the 25th. At 9:00 AM, Shibayama left Tianjin to return to Peiping. At noon, Yin Tong went to the Technical Committee building in the Beining Garden and invited Chen, Zhou, and others to hold further discussions to secretly discuss the procedures for implementing through-train service. At 1:00 PM, he hosted a banquet, inviting important officials from the railway bureau to attend. At around 2:00 PM, Yin convened a meeting in the auditorium of Ningyuan, gathering Deputy Director Xu Wenguo, Zheng Baozhao, and other important officials to instruct the heads of various departments on the matters that should be prepared. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. During the meeting, Nitta Ryo, the representative of the South Manchuria Railway Office in Tianjin, came to the railway bureau to discuss matters related to through-train service. Yin sent Yu, the deputy director of the General Affairs Department, to meet him and discuss the matter before he left. This is a general account of the discussions between China and Japan in Tianjin over the past two days regarding through-train service. As for the main organizers of the through-train service, according to information released by the Japan International Tourist Bureau, it will be named the "Oriental Travel Service." Both sides wanted to avoid using the terms "China," "Japan," or "International." The headquarters will likely be located in Shanhaiguan, with branches in Peiping, Tianjin, Shenyang, Jinzhou, and other places. There will be one president and one vice president. The president will be Chinese, internally designated as Chen Xiangtao. The company will have two departments: transportation and accounting, with two heads for each department, staffed by both Chinese and Japanese. All staff will be transferred from the South Manchuria Railway and the Beining Railway. On each train, ticket inspectors and train guards will still be responsible by the South Manchuria Railway and the Beining Railway in sections. The travel service will send people to monitor the train. All ticket fares and tickets will be handled by the travel service itself. The method is similar to that of the American sleeping car company operating sleeping cars on various railways in China and Europe. This meeting in Tianjin focused on completing the formalities. The date of through-train service was decided in Dalian, and through-train service will begin on July 1 without a doubt. (25th)</p>

<p>A Guangzhou dispatch states that since Chiang Po-cheng and Huang Shaohong arrived in Guangzhou one after another, Chen Jitang has convened a series of important meetings and has reached an agreement on methods for coordinating the suppression of bandits. Chiang Po-cheng is temporarily staying in Guangzhou to discuss military matters in detail. Huang Shaohong is staying in Guangzhou because the Southwest Party Committee still maintains its old position. Huang will return to Guangxi Province in a few days. However, not long after Huang arrived in Guangdong, He Jian, the Chairman of Hunan Province, arrived in Guangzhou. Bai Chongxi of Guangxi Province, seeing the current trend in Guangdong Province and its great importance to the current situation, also came east to discuss everything with Chen Jitang. Mr. Bai departed from Nanning on the 18th, accompanied by his secretary Wu Kangcheng, Mo Weiyi, communications director Wu Zhonggui, and five guards. On the afternoon of the 19th, he arrived in Wuzhou and met with Huang Shaohong for a lengthy discussion. The next day, Bai took the Tiansheng liner, which runs between Hong Kong and Wuzhou, and entered Guangdong. At 3:00 AM on the 20th, the ship arrived at Sanhe River in Sanshui, and he transferred to a special train prepared by the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway. He arrived at Shiwotang Station at 5:00 AM on the 21st. That morning, all the senior officials from Guangxi Province stationed in Guangdong came to the station to welcome him.

<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Liangguang Geological Survey Institute, as per usual practice, dispatches personnel to the field to carry out work during the autumn and winter seasons each year. In recent years, discoveries related to the geology and mineral resources of Liangguang have been made from time to time. This spring, the institute dispatched technician Xu Ruilin to investigate the mineral resources in the Yongning, Wuming, Longshan, Nama, Guode, and Longan areas of Guangxi. He has now completed his work and returned to the institute. According to the institute's announcement, the results obtained this time are excellent. The strata in various areas are generally quite complex. From the Cambrian period of the Paleozoic Era to the Quaternary period of the Cenozoic Era, traces of all epochs except the Ordovician strata were found. The brachiopods, corals, and foraminifera produced in the Permian and Carboniferous limestone, as well as the bivalves and dicotyledonous plant fossils in the Tertiary period, are particularly abundant and many are standardized fossils. The preservation of the specimens is also very perfect, which is rare elsewhere. In addition to the minerals discovered by predecessors, pyrite was discovered at Tianjing Ridge in Wuming this time, and several very valuable gold placer deposits were discovered at the eastern foot of Damingshan Mountain in the eastern district of Wuming. Therefore, the specimens collected this time are also particularly numerous. The specimens from Yongning, Wuming, and Longshan counties comprise seven large boxes, totaling several hundred pieces. Furthermore, mammalian skeletons and teeth from the Late Tertiary period were discovered within the territory of Wuming. According to the research of paleontology expert Dr. Zhang Xi'di, it was discovered that there were species of horses, deer, elephants, and pigs. Most notably, there was also a fragment of a primate tooth. At the same time, many stone tools such as stone axes, stone knives, and stone rings were discovered, which are considered to be relics of primitive humans from 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. This discovery has considerable value in anthropology and paleozoology. Dr. Zhang is currently very interested in this and, after detailed research, there may be further new discoveries.

<h3 id="e94">Taiwan Residents' Disturbance in the Xiamen Bombing Case; The Reason is the Detective Search and Arrest of Japanese Taiwanese in Gambling Dens; Two Bombings Occurred Overnight, Taiwanese Held Weapons and Paraded <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The 20,000 Taiwanese residents in Xiamen, who have Japanese nationality,</p>
<p>are completely outside the scope of our country's laws and administration, and are governed by the Japanese consulate, thus forming a special phenomenon. Among them, in addition to legitimate merchants, there is a part that specializes in illegitimate occupations such as opium and gambling, also forming a special anomaly. Moreover, their operation of opium and gambling has long been an open secret. Their gambling dens and opium dens all hang signs with the name of a certain foreign firm as a signboard. The Xiamen Special Public Security Bureau's detective team has been strictly cracking down on gambling dens and opium dens in the city in recent weeks, and has cracked down on many locations. On the 20th, two gambling dens were searched in the city. One was the Qifa Foreign Firm in Dasheng Lane, which was a gambling den and opium den of Chen Kuozui, a Japanese national. Taiwanese and gamblers in the den fired seven shots to resist arrest. The detectives also returned fire. Eventually, they rushed into the den and arrested twenty-six gambling criminals, seizing various opium paraphernalia and taking them to the bureau. No one was injured. The other was the Shengmao Company in Huiling Palace, which was a gambling den of a British national, Wu. Thirty-five gambling criminals were arrested, and various opium paraphernalia were seized. Someone in the den also fired shots to demonstrate, but the detectives went upstairs and they dispersed. Afterward, the British gambling den did not cause any problems. Chen Kuozui of the Japanese Qifa Foreign Firm reported to the Japanese police department established by the Japanese consulate in Xiamen Chaiqiao. Chen is a committee member of the Taiwan Association's Xiamen Port District Security, and has an office in the gambling den, with the county signboard on the wall. Therefore, Chen reported to the Japanese consulate that the Taiwan Association's District Security Committee office was destroyed. The Japanese police department immediately sent Kato Sano to negotiate with the director of the Public Security Bureau, presenting two points: (1) The execution was not done in conjunction with the Japanese police; (2) The destruction was illegal. This case is currently under negotiation. The Taiwanese side believes that the detective team's search and arrest of the Qifa gambling den was a deliberate provocation. The detective team is also on alert, and the situation is tense. On the evening of the 21st, a liquor store named Siyi Chun (Siyi Chun Liquor</p>
<p>Store was established by Chen Qingmu, the fourth group leader, and the group's office is located on the third floor) downstairs of the fourth office of the detective team in Siming East Zhengkou, was suddenly attacked by four youths who threw a one-pound bomb into the store. Fortunately, it did not explode. For a time, the shops on Siming West Road, North Road, and Guankou were all closed, preventing bilateral conflicts. Fortunately, the detectives only guarded the team headquarters and did not go out, so no incident occurred. At two o'clock in the afternoon on the 22nd, more than a hundred people gathered in front of the Siyi Chun Liquor Store to demonstrate. The detectives still tried their best to avoid conflict. At about eight o'clock in the evening, a loud explosion suddenly occurred in front of the Southeast Inn on Siming North Road. The Southeast Inn was established by Taiwanese and is the main location of the special forces of the Taiwanese. A rickshaw puller, Shi Shui, fell to the ground on the spot, with both feet injured by the explosion. Another woman was slightly injured. After the explosion, the Taiwanese immediately took the excuse that someone had thrown a bomb at them, and divided more than a hundred people into five teams, each team of twenty to thirty people, each holding submachine guns, Browning pistols, and other firearms, patrolling and searching. When the citizens saw this, they were greatly alarmed. The night markets on Siming North and South Roads, Zhongshan Road, and Datong Road were all closed in succession, and there were no pedestrians on the roads. The detectives, on the other hand, when the Taiwanese patrolled with weapons, used dozens of people to guard Siyi Chun, the second and third floors, stairs, doors and windows, and the roof, all set up sandbags. The detectives from the Detective General Office and various team departments and groups also gathered in teams to be fully prepared, and no one went out, so no conflict occurred. At that time, Wang Guopan, director of the Public Security Bureau, went to a banquet hosted by Tsukamoto Takeshi, a Japanese official. Upon hearing the report, he immediately discussed with the Japanese consul and asked him to restrain the Taiwanese to prevent the matter from escalating. The Japanese consul immediately called Chen Changfu, chairman of the Taiwan Association, and instructed him to instruct the Taiwanese in each district to refrain from acting rashly. Wang Guopan also telegraphed the Public Security Bureau, ordering the security team and the entire police force to be dispatched for temporary martial law, and ordered Lian Liangshun, director of the Detective Office, to order the detectives not to go out, so as to avoid conflict. On one side, Xie Shaozeng, chief of the First Branch, and Sano, chief of the Japanese police department, went to the Southeast Inn to investigate and found out that the bomb was thrown on the pedestrian arcade pillar between the Southeast Inn and Shenghua Foreign Firm (both operated by Taiwanese from the same family). In addition to the two people injured by the explosion, the "Fa" character of the Shenghua Foreign Firm's signboard was blown through a hole, and a piece of glass was shattered. The explosive force was not strong, and it seemed to be homemade. At ten o'clock, the armed Taiwanese had all returned, but the whole night was serious, and it only eased on the morning of the 22nd. According to the injured rickshaw puller, Shi Shui, he was waiting for customers in the Siming Theater. Someone in front of the Southeast Inn called for a rickshaw. He pulled the rickshaw to the front and saw four people, two wearing Western-style clothes and two wearing short shirts and trousers, coming out of the Southeast, one of whom was holding something in his hand and threw it violently in the middle of the street. With a loud explosion, he felt a strange pain in both thighs and fell to the ground. He saw the four people still entering the Southeast and going upstairs, etc. Afterward, according to the rickshaw driver's statement, the Public Security Bureau believed that the Taiwanese threw it themselves and negotiated with the Japanese consul. However, according to the testimony of the shop staff of the Southeast Inn, the Japanese police department said that they saw a person in black shirt coming to the middle of the road and throwing it towards the Southeast, and it exploded on the pillar of the arcade. The shop staff started chasing him, and he escaped into the Nanhua Restaurant lane. It seemed that there were many people responding at the entrance of the alley before they stopped, etc. The Japanese consul promised to investigate the Public Security Bureau's negotiations. As a result of this conflict, which started with the search and arrest of Taiwanese gambling dens, the Japanese police chief Sato hosted a banquet on the evening of the 24th to appease the director of the Detective Office and the group leaders. As a result, the Japanese consul agreed to prohibit the Taiwanese from patrolling with guns in the future, but in the future, the Public Security Bureau must cooperate with the Japanese police in handling all cases involving Taiwanese. This matter was temporarily concluded. According to the regulations, before the September 18th Incident, our officials executed the search, arrest, and detention of Taiwanese, and the extradition was carried out after the case was settled. After the September 18th Incident until recently, the Taiwanese have been completely governed by the Japanese consulate. All cases involving Taiwanese must be searched and arrested in conjunction with the Japanese police and taken directly to the consulate by the Japanese police. (June 25)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Nine Women in Huian Formed an Alliance to Commit Suicide; Ages 13 to 19; Reasons for the Alliance and Motivation for Suicide <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Seven sisters surnamed Pan and two sisters surnamed Chen outside the North Gate of Huian County, Quanzhou Prefecture, formed an alliance to commit suicide, which has attracted great attention in southern Fujian society. The cause of this incident was that Pan Sheng, the daughter of Pan, married Shi Wenzhong in Shuangguibei last August. Shi later went astray and became a bandit. Pan repeatedly tried to correct him, but was often beaten. Since the woman was abused and unwilling to marry a bandit, she developed the idea of ​​being tired of the world. At the same time, Pan Ye, the daughter of Pan Tan, was betrothed by her parents to Chen Chunsheng as a daughter-in-law, but the Chen family already had an adopted daughter-in-law, and she felt that her future was not blessed. Also, Chen Huan, the sister of Chen Xuehua, was betrothed to the son of Wang Zhuo, but she disliked that her husband was weak. The three women then recruited nine sisters to form an alliance to commit suicide. On the 21st of this month, they gathered at their mothers' home, each changed into new clothes and pants of black gauze, wore wooden clogs, and at nine o'clock at night, they went to the Houzhai Pond outside the North Gate. The nine women took off their wooden clogs and lined them up by the pond, and then tied themselves together with ropes to form a string and threw themselves into the water together. When the family members found out the next morning, the nine women had all returned to the Heaven of Departing Sorrow, and the nine corpses were linked together inextricably. The names of the nine women are: Pan Songgu, 16 years old, daughter of Pan Yuanyuan, married He Qinglin in North Gate Street last August; Pan Sheng, 19 years old, married Shi Wenzhong; Pan Ye, 19 years old, daughter of Pan Tansheng, engaged to Chen Chunsheng's son, not yet married; Bo Guan, 15 years old, daughter of Pan Daofu, unmarried; Pan Qin, 17 years old, daughter of Pan Wutan, married to a Zhuang in the village; Pan Xi, 19 years old, sister of Pan Shenqiu, married Hu Lianfa last August, currently five months pregnant; daughter of Pan Zao (name unknown), 13 years old, unmarried; daughter of Chen Qingshui, 16 years old (name unknown), unmarried; Chen Huan, betrothed to Wang Zhuo's son, unmarried. Huian is a coastal county in Quanzhou Prefecture, and the women all have natural feet. All work, both agricultural and industrial, is done by women. They plow in the fields and carry burdens on the roads. Women from Huian are commonly seen as stone workers and dockworkers in Xiamen. Men, on the other hand, mostly stay at home, manage household affairs, and take care of children. Although women in Huian are economically independent and are the burden of the family, the authority of husbands in the family is still extremely heavy, and is even greater than in other places. Therefore, the status of women is still very low. In addition, except for Huibei, the entire county has a strange custom, that is, after a woman marries, she must still return to live in her mother's home. She only returns to her husband's home for a few days during the year-end holidays such as Lunar New Year's Eve and the Ghost Festival. The rest of the time she lives in her mother's home. Couples are separated, just like the Weaving Maiden in the sky. After women endure pain and loneliness, they often form alliances with sisters to comfort each other and complain to each other. The trend of alliance suicide has arisen from this. Among them, there are young girls who have not yet tasted life, who also join in suicide. According to the elders, dozens of years ago, those who formed an alliance to commit suicide were tied together and thrown into the water. In the past twenty years, this trend has gradually subsided. In recent years, it has almost disappeared. This time, nine people died together, which has not happened in fourteen or five years. Moreover, among these nine people, many were tired of the world because of marriage, but three of them were unmarried, and one of them was only 13 years old, so they completely joined the alliance emotionally. Their tying themselves into a formation was to show that they would not regret it until death, and to agree to die together. As soon as one person jumped into the water, they had to die together, and no one could change their mind halfway. Currently, the county party department has sent a letter to the county government regarding the occurrence of this case, urging them to pay attention. The letter said, "Respectfully, it has been reported that on the evening of the 21st, a case of women forming an alliance to commit suicide by throwing themselves into the water occurred in Beimendou, the city. As many as nine people died together, which is truly shocking. It has been found that in this county, except for Huibei, women only return to their husband's house for a few days during the year-end holidays such as Lunar New Year's Eve and the Ghost Festival. The rest of the time they are in their mothers' homes, resulting in the separation of husband and wife, alliances among sisters, and cases of suicide due to being tired of the world have emerged one after another. This kind of bad custom has been around for a long time. If it is not eradicated, the consequences will be dire. I hereby request that you investigate and thoroughly investigate the parents of the deceased in this case, and issue a notice to strictly prohibit it, so that couples can live together and share the happiness of the family, and the parents should strictly supervise them and not allow any unruly behavior, so as to respect human life and save the declining trend.

<h3 id="e96">Northwestern Inspection Notes; Special Correspondent Geng Ya; Mongolian Women Whose Power Exceeds Men's <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the eighth, because the camel drivers repeatedly asked to buy sheep to reward them, I and Mr. Zhu went to a Mongolian yurt. There was a dog as large as a small donkey, barking madly but not hurting people. The owner came out to see, and the barking stopped immediately. The owner was a female lama who did not understand the language. Mr. Zhu pointed to the sheep and calculated the price to show his intention to buy. She pretended not to understand, turned around and entered the yurt, and we returned empty-handed. The dog did not chase or bark. At two o'clock in the afternoon, we left Kushui Jingzi. The sandy land gradually decreased, and there was more clay. The dust from the camels was like setting off firecrackers. On the way, we met an old Mongolian man who said, "I have sheep I want to sell, the real price is eight yuan per head." We went to the pasture with him and saw his women lying naked on the ground. When guests arrived, they straightened their clothes to greet them. The women's heads were surrounded by tinkling ornaments, weighing more than a pound. The girls had no decorations, only two braids hanging down. Mr. Zhu gave the girl candy, and the mother and daughter each ate one. The rest were taken into the yurt, probably to be shared with others. We were about to lead the sheep we bought away on a donkey, when the woman said that it was not easy for a distant guest to come here, and returned one yuan as a birthday gift. Compared to the female lama we met in the morning, who had a cold face and an iron heart, it was unbelievable that they were of the same ethnic group. The woman chased after the camel team, traveling about ten miles back and forth, sweating like rain.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock at night, we arrived at Baitu Jing and saw that the camel teams that had arrived earlier had occupied all the flat ground, so we had to find another Artemisia ground to pitch our tent and sleep. The journey that day was seventy li. The soil here is white like lime, and there are eight wells, several feet apart, with one sweet and seven bitter, which is very strange.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock in the morning on the ninth, the Suiyuan Huoyekuo Zhiju sent four armed soldiers and six plainclothes men to collect camel donations, two corners per load. Our team had seventy freight loads, and should have paid fourteen yuan. Mr. Zhou had served as the director of a public security bureau in a certain county, and mediated from the middle, so we settled for eight yuan. However, we carelessly issued donation tickets. Some of the other camel teams came forward, some paid silver, some issued tickets, and some did not issue tickets. Judging by the armbands worn by the donation collectors, one was "Suiyuan Provincial Government Inspection Office Huoye Branch," and the other was "Huoye Dizhiju." A certain camel team transporting wool to the east was secretly transporting opium, hidden in the camel saddles made of cloth, leather, and grass. The inspectors probed it with an iron bar and found it.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Shi Lianqing from Ningxia, the Huoye Dizhiju is located on the Taole Lake beach. The beach used to be the main stream of the Yellow River. During the Guangxu period, the river tilted westward, and silt accumulated to form the beach. According to legend, the two surnames, Tao and Le, grazed their animals there, hence the name. When the river shifted further west, the Dongyonghui Village and Wuduizi area in Pingluo County were completely washed away to the east of the river, and the residents moved there accordingly. Later, due to farming and grazing relations, a dispute arose between the Han and Mongolian over the beach. As a result of negotiations, a monument was erected as the boundary. The east of the monument was the pasture of the Otog Banner, and the west of the monument belonged to the Pingluo County of Ningxia. There were about a hundred households of residents, nine out of ten of whom were from Pingluo. Over the past ten years, only a few hundred hectares of land have been cultivated. The land is located between the Yellow River and the East Mountain, narrow and long from north to south for more than seventy li, and of varying width from east to west, averaging about three li. It is only a little over a hundred li away from Ningxia. Every year, Ningxia Province produces wool, hemp, licorice, wolfberries, hair vegetables, and other medicinal materials, most of which are transported out from this beach. Goods from Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places also enter Ningxia through this place. No matter what time, vehicles and horses are constantly passing through, especially in winter. It is truly an important transportation hub for the grassland. In October of the 18th year, the Ningxia Provincial Government drafted a governance plan, which was transferred to the Executive Yuan through the internal affairs department. Approval was given to establish the Dizhiju. The Suiyuan Provincial Government also advised the internal affairs department in November to establish the Huoye Dizhiju within the Otog Banner, and said that the Taole Beach was included in its administrative region, and the Ningxia Taole Beach Dizhiju should be abolished. The two sides repeatedly argued, and the result was that the Huoye Dizhiju was established. Currently, the people of Pingluo in Ningxia Province still believe that "Taole is the land silted up by Pingluo and should be governed by Ningxia Province. The boundary between the two provinces of Sui and Ning should be the Dongshan boundary monument, and the Yellow River, whose water flow is uncertain, cannot be relied upon" and other reasons, and continue to voice opposition. (It is noted that the Huoye Dizhiju is located in Taole, only a little over a hundred li away from Ningxia. The location recorded on the map is often erroneous.)</p>
<p>Baitu Jing is still more than a hundred li away from the Yellow River ferry. Someone sent a message saying, "The Tongchang ferry is calm and can be crossed." The messenger was dressed as a Mongolian man on horseback and was forty-two years old. He was originally from Shaanxi and had been working here since he was fifteen years old. The accumulation of more than twenty years of hard work and sweat has resulted in one hundred and fifty sheep and six horses, which can be considered a well-off family. However, he wants to marry a Mongolian woman, but is restricted by etiquette and has not been successful for a long time. Recently, Jia Lang, named "Buyingshu," under the jurisdiction of the Prince's Palace, consulted with "Sumuzhangge (official title) Baiyingdiuling (personal name)," gave him the Mongolian name "Daotouma," and pointed him to a widow, instructing him to marry her. However, the wealth demanded was very high. The woman's jewelry alone, two pairs of earrings and a string of beads, and the hanging temple peaks, cost more than thirty yuan, which is still considered to be of medium to low quality. If decorated with pearls (usually made of sheep bones dyed), the total price is even more limitless. Therefore, when calculating the property of Mongolian people, one should first look at the number of sheep and then observe the value of women's decorations, and then one can think more than half of it. When asked what the meaning of "Daotouma" is, he replied, "It means 'can stand'." As for the two names "Buyingshu" and "Baiyingdiuling," they mean "old rich man" and "wealthy for life."</p>
<p>Mongolian people's daily life: they get up at six o'clock in the morning, eat fried rice and butter tea, and then drive their livestock to drink water and graze in the wilderness. In the afternoon, at three or four o'clock, they drink tea and rice again, or they can bring dry food in the morning. Until six or seven o'clock, they drive the sheep into the pen in the afterglow of the setting sun, milk them, draw water, and have a busy dinner. Mutton porridge is eaten mostly at this time. In winter, when the snow is heavy, they stay at home and rarely go out, mostly only eating a full meal of mutton and drinking several bowls of thick tea melted from snow. The responsibilities of ordinary women are greater than those of men, so all the real power is also controlled by women. All things, from seeking water, sewing clothes, cooking food, herding sheep, and milking, are all done by women. Men mostly seek relatives and friends, travel far to worship Buddha, and gallop hundreds of miles, not returning for several days. Every year from July 14th to 16th, they travel thousands of miles, carrying abundant food, to gather at Zhaomiao Temple for the competition of jumping ghosts, horse racing, and wrestling. The prince also prepares silver dollars and tea bricks to reward the winners. This is truly a grand gathering for the Mongolian people who live scattered throughout the year to gather together for joy.</p>
<p>The main foods of the Mongolian people, besides mutton, rice, and tea, are butter. The method of making it is to squeeze the milk of cows and sheep every day, and put it in jars and bottles to ferment. If you steam fresh milk, a thin layer will form on the top, called milk skin, which is of good quality and high price. The remaining soup is used for tea drinking, and the concentrated substance that settles to the bottom is called Lao Danzi, also known as milk residue, which tastes sour and difficult to eat. At two o'clock in the afternoon, we set off from Baitu Jing. There was no water in the inn, so we borrowed four leather bags from the Mongolian people to transport it. We traveled seventy li and chose a place to camp, commonly known as "Guan Lingdu." On the way, we encountered a big wind, with tumbleweeds filling the sky and drifting sand covering the sun, a horrifying scene.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Songjiang; Establishment of the New Life Promotion Association <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek announced the New Life Movement, various places followed suit. The county government of this county has repeatedly received provincial orders to expound the mysteries of the New Life Movement, and ordered local agencies to organize the New Life Movement Promotion Association to preside over its implementation. The county government complied and convened a meeting at the county government this afternoon (the 28th). Representatives from various agencies attended. Jin Liguan (Secretary Wu acting) presided over the meeting and decided to elect nine members to organize this association. In addition to the county magistrate and the standing committee of the party department as ex officio members, seven groups including the Education Bureau, Public Security Bureau, First District Office, County Chamber of Commerce, People's Education Center, Provincial Middle School, and County Middle School were elected as members, and the association was established on the same day.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Anti-Smoking Committee Starts Work <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>This county was ordered to organize an Anti-Smoking Committee. The county magistrate, in accordance with the regulations, appointed Wang Zhewu, Yin Shisheng, and Zhang Shouzhi as members, in addition to himself and the director of the Public Security Bureau as ex officio members. However, Wang Zhewu, a member of the standing committee of the party department, sent a letter resigning. After the county magistrate urged him to come, he finally agreed. The committee was held yesterday and approved the candidates for secretary and deputy directors of each section, and decided to ask service personnel from all party, government, military, and academic circles to voluntarily report for a two-week abstinence period starting from the 15th of this month. If no one reports at the end of the period, the various agencies will issue a joint guarantee, and each agency will send a letter to each agency for inspection. It is reported that public officials are unwilling to report and have been flocking to the hospital to request smoking cessation, in order to break the addiction by the end of the period and not violate the provincial order.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Wuxi; Severe Drought Causes Rice Prices to Soar <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The weather has been extremely hot in recent days, with the thermometer rising above 100 degrees, which has not been seen in sixty years. The weather has been dry for a long time without rain, the fields have cracked, the farmers cannot transplant rice seedlings, and the rice seedlings are gradually withering. In addition, the river water is shallow and dry, and the water-lifting machines and boats cannot enter the river banks, so it is difficult to lift water into the fields. A drought is about to occur. In recent days, the market prices of rice and wheat have soared. White rice has already risen from six yuan and nine corners per factory to nine yuan and five corners. Within a day or two, it may exceed the ten-yuan mark, and the people are extremely panicked. The price of wheat has also risen to more than five yuan per stone. According to the experience of fishermen, it will not rain until the beginning of autumn. Currently, most of the small wheel boats in the countryside cannot travel due to the dry water. The ferry crossings from this county to Qingyangbei and Jiuligang in the north of Nanzha have been cut off. There are more than eight hundred boats docked in the common area, and the food supplies of the boaters are cut off. They have been flocking to Qingyang Jihe Dai Nei to pawn goods. If this continues, the future is worrying. The villagers in the 17th district of this county have petitioned the authorities to dredge the Lüjiang Estuary. The Construction Bureau has sent personnel to the countryside to survey. The market price of watermelons was only about two yuan per load last year, but it has soared to eleven yuan per load this year.</p>

<p>The County Chamber of Commerce has received reports from various industries stating that the Business Tax Bureau's methods of assessment increase tax amounts, and that the annual investigations and disturbances are unbearable. Therefore, representatives from various industries were invited to solicit opinions and summarize the following measures: 1. Request the Business Tax Bureau to clearly announce to the Chamber of Commerce the business tax investigation figures for various industries since the establishment three years ago, as well as the actual receipts and increases/decreases for comparison. 2. If any industry experiences business downturns or shop closures, it should be reported to the Business Tax Bureau at any time, and the business tax payable should be deducted accordingly. The Business Tax Bureau must also reassess taxes based on the actual business conditions of each industry. 3. Each industry should inform its peers to promptly pay the business tax to the Business Tax Bureau according to the previously paid amount on a quarterly basis. If there is any obstruction to collection, the payable tax amount should be temporarily deposited into the Jiangsu Bank under a separate account for safekeeping and reported to the industry association, which will forward it to the Chamber of Commerce for reporting to the county government for record. 4. If the Business Tax Bureau uses provincial regulations as an excuse to investigate and disturb merchants again, causing business instability, the Chamber of Commerce and industry associations cannot be held responsible, and self-determination will be the only course of action.</p>

<p>Liu Jun, a 20-year-old from Suqian, residing at 57 Tangliu Lane in this port, had a verbal altercation with Yin Shunbao (also known as Da Guanzi), a vegetable buyer from No. 38 Genglou Lane, while buying vegetables the day before yesterday morning, resulting in a mutual fight. Liu Jun kicked Da Guanzi in the kidney, and Da Guanzi died at around 10 PM last night. Yin Shunxi, Da Guanzi's younger brother, upon seeing his brother's death, took Liu Jun to the Public Security Bureau, requesting justice and punishment for the murderer.

<p>Sailing boat workers from Twelve Weirs had repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Finance in Beijing because motorized transport had encroached upon their livelihood. Subsequently, an order from the Ministry of Finance was received approving the conversion of 300 large and small motorized transport permits on the Hunan and Anhui coasts to sailing transport, and setting a two-week deadline for implementation. Now, four weeks have passed, and the transport has not yet been implemented. Therefore, on the 25th, representatives such as Duan Zhizhou and Yang Yunhan were sent again to the transport merchants on the four coasts to urge transport. After Duan and others arrived in Yangzhou, they held meetings at the offices of the four coasts for several days. As a result, the Hunan coast agreed to 121 permits (the weir representatives requested 189 permits), and the West Anhui coast agreed to 90 permits (the weir representatives requested 60 permits). Because no one has made contact on the Hubei coast, the representatives are still in Yangzhou, continuing discussions with the transport merchants.</p>

<p>In Shengdaozao, about three miles from Youchegang Town in the northern countryside of Jiaxing, there lived a farmer named Xu Sanmao, who was 64 years old. His son, Mao Wu, was already married. However, Mao Wu repeatedly beat his father. On the evening of the 25th of this month, Sanmao scolded his son for being lazy. Unexpectedly, Mao Wu used a long orange tree branch to beat his father violently. His father fled into the house. His daughter-in-law, Ms. So-and-so, helped her husband tie up his father with a rope and then beat him again. Finally, they abandoned the old father outside the door. After neighbors untied him, Sanmao spent the night outdoors and died the next day due to his serious injuries. Subsequently, the deceased's brother, Xu Dahe, bought a coffin and buried him, attempting to cover up the incident. However, the news spread, and the whole town knew about it. Therefore, the township head reported it to the public security station, which arrested the murderer Mao Wu. On the 28th, he was transferred to the Jiaxing local court for detention. Because the deceased had bloodstains on his forehead and bruises on his left and right ribs and waist, Wang Bangyan, the prosecutor of the Jiaxing local court prosecutor's office, went to the village on the 28th to conduct an autopsy.</p>

<p>Regarding the operation of passenger trains between Beiping and Shenyang, the government decided that a commercial organization should handle it. Among the domestic travel agencies that are solely operated by Chinese and have achieved success, only China Travel Service exists. The government instructed the agency to form the Oriental Travel Agency with the Japanese Tourist Bureau to handle express train services, with a Chinese national as the general manager in charge. Reporters learned that China Travel Service initially did not want to undertake the project after receiving the official letter from the Ministry of Railways. However, the government's urging was difficult to refuse. From the perspective of a national, it could not but exert some effort in times of national crisis. Therefore, the agency's board of directors held repeated meetings and finally decided to comply with the government's order and acknowledge the Oriental Travel Agency. After the Oriental Travel Agency is established, it is expected that expenses will be huge. It is reported that the funds will only be covered by a commission of 5% of railway ticket sales, which will be difficult to suffice. However, China Travel Service believes that this matter is a service to the country and the people inside and outside the customs. Even if there are setbacks, it will not be concerned.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Export Goods Tax Reduction Rates; No Additional Taxes Allowed; City Government Ordered to Notify <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The municipal government of this city, with the opening of Executive Yuan Order No. 3244, states that, upon investigation, the Ministry of Finance previously proposed reducing and exempting export taxes on various goods and revising tax rates. The proposal was approved by the 161st meeting of this Yuan, submitted to the 409th meeting of the Central Political Conference, and resolved in principle, and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and amendment, and then promulgated by the National Government. It has already been ordered and notified. In recent years, the export of bulk goods in our country has been mostly stagnant. The reason for this is due to the global economic panic, but high shipping costs and heavy taxes have been striking export goods. The Ministry of Finance's proposal to change tax rates this time aims to promote the development of domestic industries, expand overseas trade sales, and reduce the burden on merchants. Since the publication of the revised tax rates, the provincial and municipal governments should not add any additional taxes to the various goods with reduced export taxes in the amendment in the future, in order to comply with the central government's intention to promote industry and sympathize with merchants. In addition to separate orders, this order instructs compliance and directs subordinate units to comply accordingly. After the city government received the order, it has ordered its subordinate agencies to notify them all.</p>

<h3 id="e118">City Finance Bureau Schedules Rent Survey; Starting August 1st <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau has scheduled to start surveying rent prices on August 1st due to the increasing number of households and frequent changes in housing rental prices in the city. The announcement is as follows: The collection of housing donations has always been based on rent prices. Now, the number of households in the city is increasing, and housing rental prices are also changing frequently. In order for the bureau to calculate housing donations based on accurate rental prices and ensure that citizens bear a fair burden, we have specially formulated measures to investigate housing donations. Households with rental prices that do not match the donation amount will be re-estimated and an appropriate donation amount will be assessed for collection. If it is found that rental prices are deliberately concealed, in addition to recovering the concealed housing donations, a penalty of 20% of the donation amount to be supplemented will be imposed. However, the recovered amount will be limited to a maximum of one year's donation amount. It has been submitted to the city government for approval and implementation. The bureau has now scheduled to send personnel to start the investigation on August 1st. For all rented houses, if the rental price does not match the donation amount, the owner or tenant should report the correction before August 1st. If the house is self-built and self-occupied, and the calculated rental price does not match the current donation amount, the owner should also report the survey within the aforementioned deadline for reassessment. The donation amount for houses reported for correction and reassessment of rental price will be corrected and collected from this autumn, and no penalties will be imposed. Those who fail to report within the deadline will be dealt with according to the case after investigation without any leniency. When the bureau sends personnel to start the investigation, commercial and residential households in the city must submit the most recent rent receipt or lease or proof of the original estimated rental price to the investigators for review to facilitate the investigation and reporting. All investigators of the bureau will carry staff certificates with their photos attached to facilitate resident identification. If there are any impostors, citizens should turn them over to the nearest public security district office for legal action. If any investigators demand bribes, please report them truthfully, and they will be severely punished. In addition to sending letters to the Public Security Bureau to order its subordinate units to be informed, this announcement is made for general knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Current Fishing Season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang; Greatly Increased Fish Catches; Fishermen's Education Cannot be Delayed <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the current fishing season is about to end, so the situation in recent months is briefly described below. It is hoped that it will also be of interest to those concerned about the fishing industry.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Fishing Season Situation <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The large yellow croaker and cuttlefish season usually starts after the beginning of summer. Fishing boats from the Taiwanese gang depart earlier, sailing north from the South Seas, fishing along various fishing ports such as Miaozi Lake, Qingbang, Huangxing, Changtu, Daishan, Maji, Dongsha Corner, and Huanglong. They will return to port after the Dragon Boat Festival. Fishing boats from Fenghua, Luomen, Dongmen, and Changtu, Zhejiang East gangs depart slightly later and must wait until the beginning of autumn to return to port. In addition, there are large teams of Ningbo fishing boats without any gang affiliation, temporarily gathering in areas such as Huanao, Bixia Mountain, Yemao Cave, and Dapan Mountain, specializing in catching cuttlefish and returning to port around early July.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Security Assured <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of this fishing season, the Fisheries Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry immediately sent various warships to patrol the fishing grounds in sections and temporarily transferred patrol boats to escort fishing gangs to the fishing grounds, providing extremely tight protection. Pirates were unable to steal, and the practice of pirates selling name cards also disappeared, reducing the burden on fishermen considerably. Also, in previous years' fishing seasons, disputes often arose among fishermen, especially between cage fishing and net fishing gangs catching cuttlefish, who would compete fiercely for fishing grounds, often resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries. This year, the Fisheries Protection Office, seeing this, took preventive measures and sent a warship to be stationed permanently at the cuttlefish fishing grounds to suppress and maintain order. According to custom, the fishing grounds were divided, and each was not allowed to cross the border to fish. Therefore, this year, fishermen from various gangs were able to live peacefully and have not caused any trouble, making it the first peaceful year since the fishing season. What is unfortunate is that ignorant fishermen, due to the lack of proper entertainment venues, would go ashore to nearby towns to spend their time in improper businesses, which is a blemish on an otherwise perfect situation. Fishermen's education is an urgent and important task.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Increased Production <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>This year, due to the tireless efforts of the fisheries protection patrol boats, which were able to patrol the fishing grounds permanently, the sea was peaceful, and fishing boats from various gangs were able to boldly go to sea to fish, returning fully loaded, especially the Taiwanese gang, which could earn about 1,000 yuan per pair. The Fenghua, Daishan, Dongmen, and Ningbo gangs were next, followed by the Luomen gang. In general, they were all able to make a profit, unlike in previous years when there were uneven results and extreme differences in fortune. Also, this year, due to the increase in fish catches, ice-fresh boats from this port were extremely active in going to sea to buy fresh fish and made huge profits. Unfortunately, most of the coastal fishing factories have been seriously damaged due to years of losses and have weak purchasing power. Supply exceeds demand, and fishing boats have to sell their goods to the factories at low prices, and fishermen have to endure the pain. If fishing boats had such a abundant catch in previous years, the livelihood of the fishermen would have been prosperous. Therefore, the work of transporting fish catches to the interior for sale to stabilize fish prices is something that the government should pay attention to, which would benefit the national economy and people's livelihood considerably.</p>

<p>The various troops of former Northeast Anti-Japanese Army Generals Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, Li Du, Wang Delin, and others, after being defeated and retreating into Russia and then being transferred to Xinjiang, numbered no less than tens of thousands of people. However, the families of various troops were stranded in Shanghai and other places, facing difficult lives. After repeated requests from Li Du and others, the central government allocated travel expenses to send the families of various troops to Xinjiang, so that families could be reunited, and they could concentrate on their duties and consolidate border defense, avoiding drifting in foreign lands without any support. It is learned that the central government sympathizes with the sacrifices and contributions of the soldiers of various troops in resisting the enemy and defending the country. The National Government has ordered the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to quickly allocate funds and hand them over to Generals Ma, Su, Li, Wang, and others for distribution by name, so that various families can voluntarily relocate to Xinjiang to find their family members and avoid prolonged separation.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Investigate Machinery Supply and Demand; Situ Xi to Arrive in Shanghai Soon <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>In order to supply the machinery needs of the domestic industrial community and promote the mechanization of industry, the Ministry of Industry is preparing to establish a Central Machinery Factory to achieve self-sufficiency, and is now actively proceeding. Since the factory is in its initial stage, it is necessary to first understand the actual machinery needs of various factories in the country and the manufacturing situation of existing machinery factories in order to make future manufacturing plans, so that supply and demand can correspond and duplication can be avoided. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry has specially sent Situ Xi, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Office, to Shanghai, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Tianjin to conduct detailed investigations. It is reported that Situ will come to Shanghai soon to start the investigation work.</p>
<h3 id="e126">U.S. Loan Cotton Contract Revised; First Batch of 80,000 Bales Shipped to Shanghai; Already En Route and Arriving Soon; Stored in China Merchants Yangtze Warehouse <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the cotton and wheat loan agreement signed between our country and the United States, except for the 320,000 tons of wheat that have already been shipped, the cotton, due to the strike in the United States that prevented loading, has had its total amount reduced from 40 million U.S. dollars to 10 million U.S. dollars after the contract was revised. Now, the first batch of loan cotton has been shipped from the United States. A reporter learned that the first batch of 80,000 bales will arrive in Shanghai soon. Preparations are being made here for warehousing and other procedures. The reporter personally went to various parties to conduct a detailed investigation. The information obtained is described in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="e127">First Batch of Cotton Shipped <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Before the contract was revised, small batches of U.S. loan cotton shipped to Shanghai, starting from November last year to date, totaled only more than 50,000 bales. Later, the contract was revised by both parties, reducing the loan amount to 10 million U.S. dollars. The U.S. cotton will be shipped to Shanghai for another six months. The first batch shipped from the North American port of New Orleans totaled 40,000 tons, accounting for 80,000 bales, valued at 7-8 million yuan in national currency. In late May, ships were chartered and loading began. The port of New Orleans was not affected by the strike, so it was able to ship as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Arriving in Shanghai in Mid-July <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The large batch of 80,000 bales of U.S. loan cotton has been distributed among multiple ships for transport from the United States across the Pacific Ocean to Shanghai. Shanghai has received telegrams in recent days that most of the cotton-laden ships have already departed and are en route. It is expected that the first ship will arrive in port for import within three weeks. The second and third ships will follow in succession. After the U.S. cotton arrives in Shanghai this time, it must all be unloaded and stored in warehouses in Shanghai, and then purchased by households in batches. Therefore, the arrival date of the first batch of cotton in Shanghai is in mid-July, and shipments will continue to arrive in Shanghai continuously thereafter.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Stored in Yangtze Warehouse <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Cotton and Wheat Management Office of this port has decided to store all of the U.S. cotton in the China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze Wharf warehouse. Because the goods will arrive in Shanghai soon, Liu Hongsheng has been notified to quickly repair the warehouses at Yangtze Wharf to facilitate unloading and storage. Upon receiving this notification, Liu Hongsheng immediately sent personnel to inspect Yangtze Wharf and began work on the warehouses that needed to be repaired first. It is estimated that the repair cost will be about 4,000 yuan, which has been approved by the bureau and set a deadline for completion. At the same time, the management office of the four warehouses has also been notified to take good care of the U.S. cotton when it arrives at the wharf.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Pootung Texaco Oil Depot: All Workers Went on Strike Yesterday <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Dagon Society reports: The Pootung Texaco Oil Depot employs over two hundred workers in the kerosene production. The day before yesterday, worker Yao Longlong, from the tinning section, arrived at the factory on time for work. However, the foreign supervisor of the department, Mr. Compson, had not yet arrived, and no soldering tin was available. Fearing delays, Yao used other soldering tin as a substitute, without significant difference. When Mr. Compson found out, instead of praising the worker, he blamed him for unauthorized use of materials and suspended him for two weeks. After repeated requests from the workers, he agreed to a three-day suspension. Unexpectedly, when the worker returned to work after the three days, Mr. Compson went back on his word and refused to reinstate him. Subsequent requests from worker representatives to the manager, "Byer," were also unsuccessful, leading to widespread indignation among all workers, who unanimously went on strike yesterday morning to show their determination. Upon learning of the Texaco workers' strike, the City Kerosene Assembly Workers' Union immediately dispatched personnel to investigate the truth. They also prepared a formal report to the Party and government authorities, requesting mediation to resolve the matter as soon as possible, to avoid affecting the workers' livelihoods. In the afternoon, they sent representatives, including He Shaozhen, to the City General Labor Union to petition for assistance. The union's General Secretary, Gong Yuting, received them and inquired in detail about the cause of the dispute. He promised to work with the Party headquarters to resolve the issue and instructed the workers to maintain order. The representatives left satisfied.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Clash Between Japanese Sailors and Western Police; Western Police Officer Burman Detained in Headquarters, Released After Negotiation by Japanese Deputy Inspector <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>At ten o'clock the night before last, four intoxicated Japanese individuals took rickshaws to the corner of Chapoo Road and Haining Road in Hongkew, in front of the Weili Grand Theatre, and alighted. When the rickshaw pullers asked for payment, the Japanese men punched them instead. A middle-aged woman, Wang Ma, happened to be passing by, and the Japanese men, for reasons unknown, suddenly turned their anger on her and assaulted her as well. A Western police officer of the Hongkew police station, British national Burman (transliteration), number 187 from the San Dao Tou precinct, arrived on patrol. Witnessing the Japanese men's behavior, he immediately advised them to stop. Not only did the Japanese men not restrain themselves, but they surrounded and attacked the Western police officer. The officer, outnumbered, was injured in the assault. The Japanese men then dispersed in a commotion. Refusing to be outdone, the officer, despite his injuries, pursued them. As he approached the vicinity of the Japanese military headquarters in Shenjiawan, a large group of Japanese soldiers gathered upon hearing the noise, blocked the Western police officer, and detained him inside the Japanese military headquarters. The martial drama came to a temporary end. Around four o'clock yesterday morning, the Western Deputy Police Chief of the Hongkew police station, Englishman Hill (transliteration), returned from an outer patrol. As he approached the side entrance of the police station, he suddenly found himself surrounded and attacked by seven or eight Japanese individuals. For self-defense, the police chief immediately drew his pistol to prevent any eventuality. Unexpectedly, the Japanese men took the opportunity to snatch the pistol</p>
<p>away first, then went behind the police chief and pushed him while striking him. The police chief was caught off guard and fell, injuring his knee and bleeding. Fortunately, the plainclothes Western police chief of the Hongkew police station, Robert</p>
<p>son, had also finished his duties and was returning home. Upon arriving at the police station and seeing Hill injured and lying on the ground, being continuously assaulted by the Japanese men, he immediately intervened. The Japanese men, thinking he was not a public official because he was in plainclothes, left Hill and went away. Hill, having suffered this unprovoked and violent act, was extremely angry. Disregarding the pain in his knee, he ran back to the police station with his bare hands, intending to seek revenge. The Chinese and Western personnel in the police station tried their best to persuade him not to act rashly to avoid any accidents. Meanwhile, a certain Japanese Deputy Inspector hurried to the Japanese military headquarters to demand the release of Burman. Initially, he was unsuccessful. Later, the Japanese Deputy Inspector returned to the Japanese Consulate and invited a certain Japanese Deputy Consul to accompany him to the headquarters. Only then was Burman released. By then, it was already dawn. Since this unfortunate incident occurred, all British individuals serving in the Shanghai Municipal Council's police department have been quite indignant. Yesterday morning, those who went to the First Special District Court to resolve cases discussed the matter amongst themselves, all saying, "We British have lost face," and a look of resentment was evident on their faces.</p>
<p>The Great American Evening Post reports that at ten o'clock last night, a conflict occurred between public concession police and Japanese Marines on Chapoo Road, resulting in the detention of Western police chief Bellamy by Japanese naval officers for approximately seven hours. The incident stemmed from two Japanese sailors assaulting a Chinese woman. It is said that the woman had provoked the sailors with insulting gestures, causing her to be punched in the nose and bleed profusely. A Chinese police officer, seeing this, stepped forward to intervene and attempted to arrest the two sailors. As the two resisted arrest, Western police chief Bellamy of the Hongkew police station arrived to assist the Chinese officer. At that time, a Japanese naval patrol happened to pass by and joined the argument. According to the Japanese side, Bellamy attempted to draw his pistol, but the pistol was forcibly taken away by the Japanese sailors. Subsequently, more and more Japanese people gathered, surrounding the police. Attempting to break through and call the police station for help, they were not only stopped by the Japanese sailors, but also by Japanese civilians at the scene. Another Chinese police officer blew a whistle for help, and Western police chief Ferguson responded. Seeing the situation was unfavorable and beyond his ability to handle alone, he also attempted to call the police station but was still stopped by the crowd. An American, Mr. Paige, seeing the police in a difficult situation, managed to get a phone call through to the Hongkew police station. Before long, reinforcements arrived, but the number of Japanese sailors and Marines had also greatly increased. Seeing they were outnumbered, the police agreed to go to the Chapoo Road branch of the Japanese Marines to discuss the matter. Upon arrival, both police chiefs were detained. Ferguson was released at midnight. Thereupon, two Japanese Deputy Inspectors of the Public Concession and the Police Chief of the Japanese Consulate were invited by emergency telephone call and gathered at the Chapoo Road branch. Shortly thereafter, the Superintendent of the Hongkew police station, Kennedy, and another Superintendent, Robertson, also arrived at the scene and discussed the matter for half an hour without reaching an agreement. Finally, at one thirty in the morning, they called Superintendent General Everson, who, after arriving, continued the discussion for four hours, finally releasing Bellamy at five thirty in the morning. The case seems to have come to an end. According to the Japanese side, Everson admitted that he had violated police procedure last night by drawing his pistol against the Japanese sailors before he was released. According to police procedure, this is not allowed unless one's life is in danger. When the police returned to the Hongkew police station, they were followed by a mob who wanted to assault them. They then gathered outside the police station, their demeanor menacing. The people in the police station set up a cordon around the perimeter and locked the outer doors. Later, police from the Japanese Consulate and Japanese Marines dispersed the mob, many of whom were Japanese. According to Japanese officials, the case was a minor matter and escalated due to the hot weather, causing people to be irritable. The Japanese side also implied that Western police chief Bellamy had consumed some alcohol, and those who witnessed the scene at the time could smell alcohol on Bellamy's breath. Later, someone inquired with the Superintendent's office, and the reply was that the Superintendent had no comment. As for the Japanese claim that Bellamy had drawn his pistol against the sailors and was released after admitting to drawing the pistol, the police station has neither confirmed nor denied it. However, the police station stated that they have not received any information proving Bellamy was drunk. According to an officer of the Japanese Marines, the Shanghai Municipal Council's police will hold a meeting to thoroughly investigate the case, and the Japanese Navy will also send a representative to attend. According to a Japanese news agency, this morning (the 28th), an officer of the Japanese Special Marines issued a formal statement, hoping for an early resolution to the conflict on Chapoo Road, and stated that the Marines deeply regret the occurrence of such an unfortunate incident. He also stated that Marines officers confirmed that Western police chief Bellamy had pointed a pistol at the Japanese sailors.</p>

<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce received a letter yesterday from Liu Zhuzhai of the Yixian County Chamber of Commerce in Shandong, inquiring whether the reported claims of Germany recalling Mark notes were true and whether the notes could still be used. The City Chamber of Commerce immediately replied, stating that the Mark notes issued during the German Imperial era had depreciated in value after the European War and could not be sustained. They had long been declared invalid. At the time of issuance, the Chinese Consul in Germany had sent a letter to the former General Chamber of Commerce, which published a notice advising people not to be fooled by those selling them for speculation. Many years have passed, so there is no possibility of them being recalled. Please do not believe such rumors lightly.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Ministry of Industries Plans to Develop International Trade <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to information from the International Trade Bureau, the Ministry of Industries believes that there has been no obvious progress in the export of Chinese goods. This is due to the global financial recession and the lack of improvement by the Chinese. However, there is no effective promotion in various commercial markets abroad, and there are no Chinese goods exhibition halls. Therefore, the merits of the goods cannot be clearly displayed. In order to develop international trade and make foreigners understand the merits of Chinese goods, the Ministry yesterday ordered the overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce to quickly establish Chinese goods exhibition halls, using both Chinese and Western languages to describe the merits of the goods in detail, so that foreigners can understand and avoid confusion. At the same time, the Ministry also consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting them to instruct all consulates abroad to supervise and implement this plan in order to promote its realization.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Detailed Amounts of Travel Industry Aviation Donations Received <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Since the implementation of the travel industry aviation donation in this city on April 15th, many have enthusiastically complied with the regulations, while a few have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, since the start of the donation collection, only four to five thousand yuan have been collected.

<h3 id="e136">Fresh Pork Vendors Association Requests Withdrawal of Contract System and Announcement of Original Tax Rate of 0.5% for Pork Business Tax in Jiangbei <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The original tax rate for the pork business tax in Jiangbei was set at 0.5%. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance suddenly changed it to 1%, inviting bids for a contract system. Chen Shichu won the contract, changing the tax to 20 cents per pig. Pork merchants Xu Bomou, Chen Zimin, Liu Wenfu, Yang Zhengxiang, etc., sent a letter requesting the Shanghai Fresh Pork Vendors Association to seriously negotiate. The association's executive committee believed that the matter involved illegal exactions and should be reported to the authorities for correction. The original telegram is excerpted below: To President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government: The Jiangbei counties of Jiangsu Province's pork business tax, previously approved by the Ministry of Finance (your ministry), was to be handled according to the precedent of Anhui Province's collection through agents, charging business tax at a rate of 0.5% of the business amount for both vendors and preserved meat businesses, without counting the number of pigs in the hold or collecting the tax per pig. The Ministry-set tax rate of 0.5% is already clear. Recently, the National Financial Conference proposed five measures to rectify the business tax system. The third measure, on industry classification limits and taxation standards, stated that the first category, merchandise sales, (a) ordinary daily necessities, should be taxed at 0.5%. Selling pigs also falls under the category of daily necessities, making the tax rate of 0.5% even clearer. Furthermore, the fourth measure stated that business tax should not be levied on goods themselves but should be levied on employment, not on goods, which would be akin to levying transit duties. Existing methods such as collection through commercial associations, inviting bids for contracts, and sharing the tax among businesses easily lead to abuses and should be thoroughly reformed in each locality. The regulations are strict and the measures are excellent. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance suddenly changed the pork business tax in the Jiangbei counties from 0.5% to 1%, altering the method and inviting bids for a contract. Chen Shichu won the contract and set up offices along the routes of each county in the guise of Jiangbei Pork Business Tax Commissioners, advising pork boats to dock and counting the pigs in the hold to tax them at 20 cents per pig. They also collect inspection fees for the tickets along the way. Any slight non-compliance results in detention. Because the pork merchants know that pigs are perishable goods, if they are detained and delayed, they risk death. Therefore, they can only painfully pay the tax. However, the tax tickets still state that the tax is being collected at 1% of the principal. The deceitfulness of this tactic is self-evident. According to the Jiangbei market price, each pig is valued at only about 10 yuan. Taxing 20 cents per pig exceeds the Ministry-set tax rate several times. At a time when commerce is declining and the rural economy is collapsing, and when maintaining and restoring it is already precarious, such illegal and oppressive measures will inevitably cause merchants to hesitate and farmers to stop raising pigs. The impact will be unthinkable. The contract system has serious drawbacks. In order to win the bid, contractors offer high prices. Once they win the bid, they disregard the law and are oblivious to the big picture. They only know to extract as much as possible, arbitrarily and oppressively. The so-called losing in the east and gaining in the west only increases the burden on pork merchants, accelerating rural bankruptcy. We earnestly implore you to care about the people's plight and sympathize with the merchants' difficulties. We urgently request that you order the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to withdraw the contract system and issue a clear order announcing that the pork business tax is 0.5%, and that no oppressive collections should be allowed in violation of the order, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and maintain the people's livelihood. We anxiously await your command. Shanghai Fresh Pork Vendors Association, respectfully.</p>

<p>Guowen News Agency reports: Wang Zhentao, the owner of Maotaixing Foreign Goods Store on Xinza Road, was shot and killed by the Iron Blood Anti-Traitor Corps in February of the previous year for selling Japanese goods. Subsequently, through the confession of a captured criminal, it was falsely alleged that Wang Zhaocheng of Haining was arrested by the police and accused of instigating the assassination of Wang Yirong. The case is still under investigation and has been postponed for further questioning. It is learned that most people in this city know that Wang is a law-abiding citizen and a member of the Kuomintang. When the previous case occurred, Wang was working in Nanjing. He has been falsely implicated and should be assisted. Therefore, the Third District Party Headquarters of Shanghai Special Municipality yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters requesting that it find a way to rescue Wang.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Communications promulgated the Measures for the Examination of Crew Members on Vessels Under 50 Tons, it issued another order yesterday to local shipping administration bureaus, shipping industry associations, crew member organizations, and seafarers' unions, setting a deadline for applying for examination. The original text reads: "The Provisional Regulations for the Examination of Crew Members on Vessels Under 50 Tons were promulgated on April 9th and circulated for implementation. Article 14 of the regulations stipulates that crew members without certificates should apply for examination within six months from the date of promulgation of the regulations. The remaining four-month deadline will soon pass. Those who do not have certificates by then must immediately cease service. Therefore, another order is hereby issued that you should all comply and apply for examination by the deadline. Do not wait and see. This is a most important order."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Communist Party Member Zhou Xiancheng's Declaration of Surrender <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Communist Party member Zhou Xiancheng (pseudonym Lao Cao), a native of Suzhou, Anhui, is 29 years old. Moved by patriotic enthusiasm due to the national crisis of the September 18th Incident and angered by the partial phenomena and personal dissatisfaction at the time, he joined the Communist Party after the January 28th Incident through the introduction of Li Jinsheng and was assigned to a street branch. He successively served as a propaganda officer for the Communist Workers' Union, an organization affairs officer for the Jiangsu Provincial Committee, a propaganda officer, a provincial committee inspector, and an internal transport officer for the Provincial Standing Committee. A week ago, he was transferred from transport work to the position of Party Secretary of the General Command of the British-American Strike. He had just started working when he was arrested. After being persuaded and guided, he suddenly realized the truth and surrendered, issuing a declaration saying: "I am an intellectual who has lived in the Communist Party for nearly three years. During the work process, I often felt disappointment and hit walls, deeply understanding that the Communist Party is an obstacle to the national united front. In my recent arrest, I was sincerely persuaded and analyzed by several amiable and kind advanced comrades regarding the current reality of China. I have even more clearly realized that the Communist Party's politics are on the wrong path. The theory of class struggle is not suitable for an industrially backward China, just as one pharmacy cannot cure different diseases. The core of the Communist Party advocates class struggle, believing that class interests outweigh national interests, thus forcibly creating classes in China and causing them to harm each other, giving imperialists the opportunity to benefit. Therefore, during the War of Resistance against Japan, the Communist Party provoked non-cooperation between officers and soldiers, disrupted the rear, seized cities, and expanded bandit areas, implementing separation. Such a frantic Communist Party has made mistakes and conspiracies that undermine the national united front. Therefore, especially since the September 18th Incident, the Communist Party's organization has been collapsing day by day, and the people's faith has been disappearing day by day. The atmosphere of self-reflection has formed an unstoppable trend, from individual to whole batches. In short, the Communist Party is reaching the final stage of its demise. What China needs most now is a unified national front to fight against domestic and foreign feudalism and imperialism, and to implement the Three People's Principles revolution so that the nation can be revived. Now that Xiancheng has discovered the bright path and the truth of the revolution, he vows to serve under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, uphold the Three People's Principles, and strive for the national revival movement. He is willing to do everything in his power to eliminate the Communist Party, eradicate all reactionary forces, and seek the survival and liberation of the Chinese nation. He also hopes that young people who have gone astray will humbly reflect on their mistakes, quickly realize the truth, and strive toward the bright and true path of the Three People's Principles."</p>

<p>Hu Minggao, a clerk from a small cigarette paper store in Qidong, impersonated Wu Zhifen, a lawyer from Anhui who graduated from the defunct Min'guo University in Beiping. He fraudulently joined the Shanghai Bar Association last July as a member and also joined the Wuxian Bar Association, practicing law in both Suzhou and Shanghai. After being reported, the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate summoned Wu Zhifen, i.e., Hu Minggao, for investigation and detention. It is now learned that the prosecutor Lou Ying issued an order to the Shanghai Bar Association yesterday to suspend Wu Zhifen's practice of law. The original order reads: "Hu Minggao, who impersonated lawyer Wu Zhifen, is currently in custody.

<p>Following the assassination of lawyer Luo Zhaoxin at the entrance of Qinghefang alley on Hubei Road in the Public Concession, his family requested assistance from the Shanghai Lawyers Association, asking them to forward a letter to the Concession authorities to strictly apprehend and investigate the perpetrators. The association has already submitted this matter to a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members. Supervisory committee member Wu Kaisheng, a lawyer, stated that Luo's assassination was a misfortune for the legal profession, and while there have been many assassinations in Shanghai, this was the first time a lawyer had been assassinated. He suggested that out of professional solidarity, the association should offer a reward for the arrest of the main culprit. After deliberation and approval by the meeting, a letter was sent to the Public Concession police authorities yesterday, urging them to swiftly apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice. Simultaneously, a reward notice was published, stating that anyone who can capture the main culprit in the assassination of lawyer Luo Zhaoxin will be rewarded with 300 yuan by the association, with funds reserved and a promise not to break their word.</p>

<p>The weather has been extremely hot in various regions recently, particularly in our city. Temperatures have consistently reached over 100 degrees, even reaching 98 or 99 degrees indoors. The drought and stifling humidity are causing widespread discomfort. The heat persisted yesterday, with a high of 101.5 degrees, only half a degree lower than the previous day.

<p>The hot weather in the city has led many residents to consume cold foods, often neglecting hygiene. As a result, there have been several cases of seasonal illnesses. Yesterday, there were more than a dozen cases of dysentery, all of whom sought medical treatment. Fortunately, there have been no cases of cholera. Recognizing the sudden change in climate and the increasing number of sick residents, all emergency hospitals plan to establish operations earlier than scheduled, with a target date of the first of next month.</p>

<p>[This refers only to imported goods; domestic products are not included]</p>
<p>Last year, imports of perfumes and powders reached over 1.5 million yuan. From January to April of this year, they reached 520,000 yuan, mostly consumed by women in the Shanghai area. This astounding figure is shocking. A Datong News Agency reporter learned from the International Trade Bureau yesterday morning that perfume imports in May reached 213,985 yuan, surpassing previous figures. This demonstrates that Shanghai women are not showing any restraint. However, the aforementioned figures only cover perfumes and powders. The import of foreign cosmetics and real and imitation jewelry is also substantial. In May, imports of cosmetics totaled 63,508 yuan, and imports of real and imitation jewelry totaled 27,720 yuan. Therefore, the total import value of women's goods in May was 300,513 yuan. Looking at the import figures for women's goods over the past five months of this year, perfumes and powders totaled 747,627 yuan, cosmetics totaled 229,610 yuan, and real and imitation jewelry totaled 136,240 yuan, bringing the total to 1,113,477 yuan. This clearly demonstrates that Shanghai women's love of "nature" is truly captivating.</p>

The entire family lived on a houseboat in the Fahua River near Tongren Bridge in Xujiahui Town, western Shanghai. Recently, due to the hot weather, Yukou suddenly contracted measles and died within a few hours. Unexpectedly, Guosheng and Agou also contracted the same illness. Initially, they suffered abdominal pain and vomiting, followed by a burning fever. Changsu, lacking the means for medical treatment, only gave them two bottles of herbal medicine water, but the medicine had no effect, and their condition worsened. Unable to provide further assistance, the two brothers died one after another yesterday morning around 10 AM, causing great sorrow for the family. They were finally laid to rest in the evening.</p>

<p>Zhao Peiying (also known as Fan Zhenzhen), a local woman who works as a Suzhou opera singer, was previously involved with Li Shiquan, a grandson of Li Hongzhang. Their relationship soured, and Zhao sued Li for enticement. The trial resulted in Li being acquitted, and the verdict was upheld after three appeals. More recently, Zhao sued Li for abandoning their child, but then suddenly withdrew the lawsuit. These events have been previously reported in detail in this newspaper. Now, because Li consistently denies having lived with Zhao and absolutely denies that the child is his, Zhao has hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court against Li to confirm his identity. Once his identity is confirmed, she will pursue further litigation. Judge Qiao Wanxuan summoned the parties for questioning in the Civil Court 7 yesterday afternoon and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Self-Made Moth Aircraft Completed Yesterday; Soon to Undertake a National Long-Distance Maiden Flight; Piloted by Instructor Xu Chengqi <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Navy Aviation Plant has completed the construction of its self-made Moth steel-framed training aircraft after more than two months of work. According to sources at the plant, the aircraft will soon undertake a national long-distance maiden flight. The construction process of the aircraft is detailed below.</p>
<p>Motivation for Construction: The construction of the steel-framed Moth training aircraft was motivated by the fact that after the Jiangfeng training and reconnaissance aircraft was converted into a seaplane, there was a shortage of training aircraft for students. The Aviation Plant drafted a plan that was approved by the Naval Department for construction. The cost of the aircraft is approximately 15,000 yuan, similar to that of the Ninghai.</p>
<p>Aircraft Structure: The Moth aircraft is a biplane with a waterborne design. The fuselage is silver-gray, the frame is sturdy, and the exterior is attractive. It has a payload of 766 kilograms and seats two people. It can fly for seven hours with a range of 896 kilometers.</p>
<p>Long-Distance Flight: The aircraft is scheduled to undergo a test flight in early next month. After a thorough inspection of the components, it will begin its national long-distance maiden flight. The pilot will be instructor Xu Chengqi, who previously attempted a long-distance flight with the Jiangfeng but was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications issued an instruction to the Postal Administration, International Telecommunications Bureau, Telephone Bureau, Telecommunications Administration, Radio Station, Postal Savings and Remittances Administration, Telegraph Bureau, Long-Distance Telephone Administration, China Merchants Bureau, and China and Eurasia Airlines, stating: "Upon investigation, employees of all state-run agencies under the Ministry must be courteous, humble, and sincere in their interactions with Chinese and foreign individuals, and must not act arrogantly or neglectfully. This instruction was issued to all agencies in March of this year. However, it has recently come to our attention that a few employees have deeply ingrained habits and have failed to correct their behavior. It must be understood that courtesy is essential in human interaction, especially in China, which is known as a nation of etiquette. Public servants should strive to 'serve the people' as their mission, and state-owned enterprises should be subject to government supervision and guidance, with the people as the focus, as sovereignty resides with the people. From a business perspective, those who come are customers and must be treated with the utmost respect. All employees should understand this principle deeply. As the New Life Movement is being implemented nationwide, all civil servants must correct their behavior if they have shortcomings, and strive to be a role model for society. In the future, any such misconduct that interferes with business is a minor matter, but it will have a significant impact on the government's credibility. Strict rectification is necessary to maintain discipline. Therefore, we reiterate this order to the heads of all agencies, requiring them to pay special attention to the attitude of all employees towards Chinese and foreign individuals. Any cases of arrogance or disrespect should be immediately punished according to the severity of the offense. The Ministry will also dispatch personnel to conduct thorough inspections at any time. If the heads of agencies fail to report such incidents or engage in concealment, the Ministry will also impose penalties. In addition to separate orders, we hereby instruct the bureau to relay this order to all employees, requiring them to strictly comply without fail."</p>

<p>[The debate concluded yesterday; sentencing on July 3rd]</p>
<p>The case of the armed robbery of 12,000 yuan in cash from the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm at No. 9 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession at 4:30 PM on the 9th of this month has been reported to the police. Based on the victim's report, the French police first arrested Zhang Zuming, the owner of Ruichangshun Hardware Store at No. 101 Broadway. According to Zhang's confession, Zhuang Jimeng (Zhuang Yuan Junior), Wang Lianyou (hardware salesman), Tang Qingyue (director of Dade Hospital) and other four people were arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court. The police department filed a public prosecution based on Article 1, paragraph 14 of the Law on Punishing Bandits. Details of the trial have been reported in the 24th issue of this newspaper. After this case occurred,</p>
<h3 id="e160">It Created a Sensation in Shanghai <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The public's attention was drawn to it. During the adjournment, the defense lawyers hired by the defendants requested to review the case files, compare the transcripts of the testimonies of all parties, and collect counter-evidence, requesting the court to investigate or list witnesses and request summons. Yesterday was another scheduled continuation of the trial. The number of spectators was even greater than last time. The number of people inside the First Court was so crowded that those who arrived later had no place to stand and were standing by the windows and in the corridors. The defendants' defense lawyers, Lin Yingqing, etc., arrived at the court after 9 AM to wait for instructions. At 10 AM, Judge Li Changnian, together with Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan, sat in the First Criminal Court for the trial. Lawyer Shan Feixi Zhen of the Police Department appeared in court as a representative.</p>
<h3 id="e161">From the Police Department <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Chief Inspector Wan Langdeng (transliteration) attended the court. Later, Chief Prosecutor Chen was absent due to other important matters, and Prosecutor Wang Ren attended the court. The judge first summoned Zhang Lifeng, a witness for the defendant Zhang Zuming. He stated that he was the manager of Jingdaxiang Money Exchange and had been in contact with Zhang Zuming. Zhang had recently deposited 2,000 yuan, withdrawing 300 yuan each time on the morning and evening of June 10, for a total of 600 yuan. He deposited twice again on the 14th and 15th, 500 yuan each time, for a total of 1,000 yuan. This was true. Judge asked Zhang Zuming about it. He claimed that he won 828 yuan playing mahjong on the 11th, and added 172 yuan to make it 1,000 yuan, which he deposited in Jingdaxiang Money Exchange. He also asked what the withdrawn funds on the 10th were used for. Zhang replied that he used 200 yuan to repay the store's debts, and the remaining 100 yuan for his own use. At this point, Zhang's defense lawyer claimed that the defendants had been</p>
<h3 id="e162">Arrested and Detained <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>After that, lawyer Yan Luqing and Zhou Jinggeng came to the defendants' homes to ask for money. There are witnesses who can testify, and they requested to summon them. Judge then ordered Zhou Jinggeng to be summoned. He stated that he was a compradore at Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm. The stolen money was his own. At around 3 PM that afternoon, he sent three people to the China Industrial Bank to withdraw 48,000 yuan in cash, to be used at the Yiyuan dog racing track that evening. Judge asked if he had ever gone to the defendants' homes to ask for money. Zhou replied that he went to Ruichangshun first, accompanied by a person surnamed Cao, and then to Zhuang Yuan Da, but he only mentioned the amount of the losses in the two robberies. They had asked someone to speak for them first. Yesterday, defendant's lawyer Qiu Fenling also came to our office to contact lawyer Yan. At this point, lawyer Qiu Fenling stood up and stated that the court was requested to instruct Zhou Jinggeng to speak</p>
<h3 id="e163">Seriously and Responsibly <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Otherwise, he would be prosecuted for perjury. The lawyer stated that the reason for my visit to the plaintiff's residence yesterday was to view the robbed location and that he was presenting a drawn diagram as evidence and that he has never contacted lawyer Yan Luqing. Then, witness Zhang Zuyin stated that the defendant Zhang Zuming was his younger brother, and that on June 9, Zuming was at the Jiangwan racecourse, and that the next day, lawyer Yan, along with Zhou Jinggeng and others, came to the Ruichangshun store, claiming that my brother had committed the crime of banditry. He said that in view of our sympathy for the suffering of your brother, they must return the total loss of 60,000 yuan for the robberies in past years, and that the whole matter could be resolved, otherwise, there would be no room for defense. At that time, the merchant replied that if my brother did have</p>
<h3 id="e164">Criminal Acts <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Don't just say you are dealing with him, even I, as his elder brother, will have to deal with him. Then, more than ten witnesses including Tang Xiangrui, Lin Xuezhang, Ma Shichang, Cai Songmao, and Zhang Jinyuan testified that they saw lawyer Yan Luqing and Zhou Jinggeng, etc., come to the Ruichangshun store to demand 60,000 yuan. Then, witness Zhao Zhongdi stated that on the 18th, he took Zhou Jinggeng's car to Ruichangshun Zhuang Yuan Da, because lawyer Yan Luqing wanted me to go with him. His idea was that if Zhang Zuming committed robbery, the matter could be minimized, so he accompanied him there, but he did not interject when lawyer Yan and Zhou were talking. Judge questioned Zhang Zuming about who he confessed: Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, Tang Yingyue, etc. Zhang replied that he was frightened at the police station and</p>
<h3 id="e165">Mentally Confused <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Confessed to the three people. Zhuang was a classmate, Wang was an apprentice at Ruichangshun, and he knew Tang because he was his uncle's apprentice. Tang was a doctor, and I had asked him to see a doctor before. He also said that on the 9th, he went to the Jiangwan racecourse with his brother and his uncle Wei Bingzhen in a Yunfei car and lost 70 yuan, etc. At this point, Xia Musheng, the driver of Yunfei Car Company, was summoned. He testified that at 12:55 PM on June 9, a servant came to call a car, and he drove to the entrance of Yangzhengli on Tangshan Road. Three people in Chinese clothes got in and went to Jiangwan. Upon arriving at Jiangwan, they paid a fare of 1 yuan and 6 jiao. Because he thought it was too little, he argued and received an additional 2 jiao. Judge ordered Xia to identify any of the three defendants. Xia looked back and examined them, and said, "I recognized him" (pointing to Zhang Zuming) and "He paid the money"</p>
<h3 id="e166">And Even Scolded Me <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Judge asked Xia what kind of clothes he was wearing, and he replied, "Wearing blue clothes," etc. Then, witnesses Dong Zhengqing and Lin Pengfei testified that they did see Zhang Zuming at the Jiangwan racecourse on June 9, and saw Zhang borrow 50 yuan from Chen Qiaoding. Judge then questioned the second defendant, Zhuang Jimeng, who stated that he was a classmate of Zhang Zuming at Chengzhong School, but they did not see each other often. On June 9, he stayed home because he had been naughty with his wife the day before. He played mahjong with his sister, brother-in-law, cousin, and himself, and knew nothing about the robbery. Judge then questioned the third defendant, Wang Lianyou, who stated that on the morning of the 9th, he was running business at the Jili and Daowen Foreign Companies. In the afternoon, he sent a list from the Daowen Foreign Company to Hengdaxiang Hardware Store, and gave it to Hielixie's Sun Zhaofan. Then, Sun Zhaofan came to testify and proved that Wang did come to my store that afternoon, he usually sent the list</p>
<h3 id="e167">To My Store <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>etc., Judge then summoned the fourth defendant, Tang Qingyue, for questioning. At that time, Tang's defense lawyers Chen Tingrui and Sun Zuji approached the court and stated that before questioning Tang Qingyue, there was a fact to report to the court. It was really heartbreaking to say it, but in order to uphold justice and maintain the ethics of the legal profession, they had to report to the court. At this time, the atmosphere in the courtroom suddenly became tense. First, Sun Zuji stated that at 8:30 AM on the 20th of this month, the lawyer received a phone call from the family of the defendant Tang Qingyue, saying that Qingyue had been arrested for involvement in theft, and they entrusted him to defend him in court. The lawyer believed that Tang Qingyue was the nephew of Mr. Tang Wenzhi of Taicang. His family was</p>
<h3 id="e168">Family of Scholars <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>and Qingyue had founded a hospital in Shanghai for more than ten years. He was a weak person and would never have done this. So he went to the First Court to defend him. The judge believed that Tang did not have a serious suspicion and handed him over to the lawyer for bail, waiting for him to surrender to your court the next day. At 2 PM in the afternoon, the lawyer went to the office of the Mainland Commercial Market and made a phone call to lawyer Yan Luqing, telling him that Tang Qingyue would never be a thief, and asked him to handle the case with caution. Yan Luqing replied that there must be exchange conditions, and said that he would come to contact him immediately. Soon Yan came to the office with a person surnamed Zhou, saying that if he wanted to handle the case carefully, there must be exchange conditions, and that Tang Qingyue was a robber, and they must negotiate. I rejected it because I could not accept it, and Yan left. Then he came back and said that if it wasn't settled today, four people would identify him in the Second Special District Court tomorrow, and Zhang Zuming said he had to</p>
<h3 id="e169">Four Thousand Dollars <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>It can be done. Then they reduced it to two thousand yuan, and I laughed it off. Then lawyer Chen Tingrui arrived, and Yan and Zhou wanted to leave. I told him not to go and we could talk, and told lawyer Chen about it, and then asked Chen to report it. Then Chen Tingrui said, "That day I went to lawyer Sun's office, and I had not yet been appointed as the defender of Tang Qingyue. When I saw this, I felt very angry. I asked what would happen if I didn't agree to pay 4,000 yuan?" At this point, lawyer Sun continued to report, "Yan, etc., saw that the negotiation was unsuccessful, and left. But then they kept calling to ask for money. I then went to Dade Hospital and met Mr. Tang Wenshou, Tang's father, and told him what had happened, but Tang's father insisted on entrusting me to carry out</p>
<h3 id="e170">Negotiate <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The lawyer had been a judge and an administrator and had never heard of such a thing. Then he excused himself and refused, and then went to a small restaurant downstairs from Yan Luqing's office at 49 Sichuan Road with a doctor, Qin Daoyuan, to discuss with Yan, etc. Yan asked if this was appropriate. The lawyer asked him if Tang had been a thief and what evidence he had. Yan said that he was not talking about this, but only about the 4,000 yuan. I would like to ask how this could be done in Shanghai, which has more than 3 million residents. In the end, the negotiations broke down. On the morning of the 21st, the lawyer and Tang Yingyue surrendered to the court. After the judge questioned them, because the case had not been prosecuted, he instructed Tang to hand it over to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Agile Investigation <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>To convene plaintiffs, witnesses, and the same 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 3rd defendants for investigation, and order the plaintiffs and witnesses to identify Tang Qingyue. But they identified the wrong person, it was not Tang. Tang was released on bail and sent to the hospital by your court. When the lawyer was taking a car with Tang's family, Mr. Pan, to find a guarantor on Avenue Joffre, Yan and Zhou rushed to ask why the lawyer had not paid the money, and even argued in the middle of the road. I replied that I could not agree with them. If they wanted money, they would go to the police station to resolve it. At this point, they suddenly softened, and later they rushed to the lawyer's office in the mainland South Mall, and Mr. Pan handed over a package of 2,000 yuan in banknotes, which was taken by lawyer Yan</p>
<h3 id="e172">Hastily Retrieved <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>If this lawyer makes any false or slanderous statements, I am willing to accept the most severe sanctions, including being disbarred from legal practice, and I am willing to guarantee with my life that Tang Qingyue will not be involved in robbery." After lawyer Sun finished speaking, there was applause and cheers from the audience. It only stopped after the police intervened. The judge then declared that this was a separate matter outside the case. After the announcement, he questioned Tang Qingyue again, who stated that he rarely met with Zhang Zuming and that he was in charge of clinic management at the hospital every day and did not often go out. The judge then summoned the four witnesses for the plaintiff, Gao Yushu, Feng Ti, Wan Guirong, and Qian Genghua, to the stand and questioned them about</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Robbery Incident <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>They still testified as before, identifying the first defendant, Zhang Zuming, as the leader, who entered first with the third defendant, Wang Lianyou, to commit the robbery. The judge then ordered Gao, Feng, and Wan to take off their clothes and examine the white bamboo cloth vests they were wearing where the banknotes were hidden in the pockets. The judge then ordered Gao to take off his vest and present it to the court for investigation. At this point, the court deemed the evidence investigation complete and the trial concluded. The judge then ordered the start of the debate, first by lawyer Fei Xizhen, representing the police department, followed by prosecutor Wang Ren</p>
<h3 id="e174">Expressing Opinions <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Finally, the defendants' lawyers Jiang Yiping and E Sen, among others, debated in succession. The plaintiff's representative, lawyer Yan Luqing, then stated that he requested an incidental private prosecution to recover losses of twelve thousand yuan. The defendants' lawyers all rose to object, stating that lawyer Yan's request to recover the private prosecution portion was not in accordance with the litigation procedure because the written complaint had not been submitted in advance. They requested the court to order a separate lawsuit. At this point, Judge Li announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 8:00 AM on July 3rd. The defendants Zhuang Jimeng and Wang Lianyou were ordered to be released on bail by three interconnected shopkeepers, Tang Qingyue remained on his original bail, and Zhang Zuming was remanded in custody. By the time the judge adjourned the court, it was three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Liang Chengyu, the former Chinese detective of the No. 2 General Police Station, was accused of kidnapping Li Huiqing and Lu Shifan and demanding ransom. The First Special Court sentenced him to death. The Jiangsu Provincial Government considered that there were still doubts and sent the case back to the First Special Court for retrial. Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the retrial. Liang believed that Judge Wu's trial was unfair and requested his recusal, which had been rejected. Judge Wu still presided over the final trial. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu opened the eighth criminal court and announced the verdict: Liang Chengyu was sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping and demanding ransom. Liang was dissatisfied with the verdict and again appointed lawyer Hu Jue as his appellate defender, declaring an appeal in court. The court granted it.</p>

<p>The foreign clothing industry in this city has traditionally had the Northern Changsheng Guildhall, located at the Lower Hai Temple on Tangshan Road. In the past, the directors took turns serving as head officers. Recently, party and government organs appointed industry leaders to organize a reorganization committee to start restructuring to comply with new laws and regulations and to revitalize the business. However, the reorganization has been going on for a long time, with many disputes and obstacles preventing the convening of a general meeting. The committee recently issued a public notice, which will be widely published in various newspapers in the coming days. Here is the original text: "This association was ordered to reorganize the Northern Changsheng Guildhall. The progress has been reported in the Shen, Xin, Chen, and Min newspapers in May. We originally intended to convene an election meeting as soon as possible to carry out the handover. However, the organization department only handed over the newly compiled list of members, but the old eight ledgers and account books of this guildhall have not yet been submitted to the association, making it impossible for the association to verify them. Therefore, the matter has been delayed. This association has now submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, ordering the reorganization committee members Wang Jiliang and Wu Fuji to submit the old regulations and eight account books to the bureau for verification. In addition to instructing Wang and Wu to comply with the order, we expect to convene a general meeting in the near future. We are deeply concerned that members may not understand the truth, so we hereby announce the above. Chairman of the Committee: Xu Shanchang. Standing Committee Members: Wang Fuchen, Zhang Baofu."</p>

<p>Yao Benyuan, the chief of the Wusong 7th District Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, learned on the afternoon of the 27th of this month that over a hundred Guangdong hooligans, who usually resided in Shanghai, were carrying a large number of weapons, including explosives, bayonets, iron bars, iron whips, and nitric acid, and were intending to attack Zhang Yucheng, a worker in the factory. Fortunately, Chief Yao Benyuan discovered it early and prevented a major disaster. He arrested the leaders, Li Niubo and Zhuo Xue, and over twenty of their accomplices, including Chen Hua, and took them to the precinct for questioning. They made cunning excuses. Chief Yao believed that the case involved gathering a crowd to commit violence with weapons, which would disrupt public order, and submitted a report with witnesses to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<p>The stations along the two railway lines are mostly located in rural areas, and stray dogs often break into the stations. Not only are the dogs dirty, which is unsightly, but their excrement on the ground also hinders cleanliness. If they bite passengers or if rabid dogs spread rabies, it would seriously affect the railway service. The bureau, emphasizing hygiene, has instructed the traffic department and the police department to strictly ban them from entering the stations.</p>

<p>Mr. Chen Hanqiang has lived in Australia since childhood and is proficient in Western boxing. He has participated in boxing matches in that country for 21 years, competing with world-renowned boxers over 400 times. Except for three defeats, Chen won all the other matches.

<p>Pan Lanshi, a poet from Lingnan, passed away more than two months ago. His funeral arrangements were handled entirely by his friends and students, and his son has never been heard from. Therefore, it was not possible to issue an obituary or hold a funeral. Now, his friends Ye Gongchuo, Wu Tiecheng, Xia Jiancheng, Yao Yuqin, Lu Danlin, Feng Wenfeng, and Tan Jingtang An, among others, have initiated a memorial service to be held at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM on July 1st. A notice has been issued. Those who wish to send condolences should use cash and send it to Jin Songqing at the China Arts and Crafts Hall, 692 Hankou Road, to help the widow and orphans. Pan's last couplet, for the Small Collection of Jian Song Pavilion, the Peach Blossom Appreciation Poem, is appended below: "Last night, both feet were clear this morning (Lan), baby orioles and swallows all rejoice (Dong), the spring scenery in the small garden urges the guest's dream (Zhuang), looking at the flowers under the moon, the eyes are brighter (Jin). A branch of scarlet peach in the courtyard is like red snow (Lan), as if one were in Heyang City (An). Where is the otherworldly flower source of apricot (Dong)?

<p>▲ Domestic Yantai Beer Sales Increase Sharply Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement, the whole country has followed suit and the atmosphere has changed. Taking beverages as an example, those who previously worshipped foreign beer now only value domestic Yantai beer. These people know that the so-called foreign goods are only manufactured by foreign merchants in China using tap water. They are called foreign goods, but in fact, they only offer money to foreigners. Yantai beer, on the other hand, is made with pure spring water, is of good quality, delicious, and beneficial to health. It is indeed the best domestic product. Recently, patriots have been vying to buy and prepare it for consumption at any time. When going to restaurants for banquets, they must specify to drink Yantai beer, unlike before, when they did not ask about the type, allowing waiters to use foreign goods to make up the number and be deceived.

<p>▲ Ding Jiwan Benefits Hongkou Patients Since the beginning of this summer, the weather has been extremely hot. According to the warning issued by the Observatory, it has broken the highest June record in the past sixty years. The hot summer is long, and the heat is terrible. Shanghai is densely populated, and the living conditions are not suitable. Summer is the most prone to infectious diseases. Philanthropists have seen this and have started to set up clinics to benefit patients. Dr. Ding Jiwan has specially set up a clinic in Changle Lane 28, Sibianzi Bridge, Hongkou, in the American Concession to provide free diagnosis and medicine. The diagnosis is provided by Dr. Lu Yikang and Dr. Cheng Renshan, who are rich in knowledge and experience. Both doctors graduated from the Chinese Medicine Academy and are Ding's senior students. It is very convenient for patients in the Hongkou area.</p>
<p>▲ Huining Fellow Association Donates Free Clinic Vouchers In addition to the original year-round free clinic, the Huining Association in Shanghai also sets up a temporary free clinic every summer to provide free diagnosis and medicine to benefit the poor and sick. This year, in order to facilitate patients, it will start donating free clinic vouchers from July 1st. It has specially invited famous Chinese and Western doctors from Huining in Shanghai, such as Chinese medicine practitioners Shao Yiqun, Zhu Jiyan, Huang Yangqu, and Jin Chichen, and Western medicine practitioners Dai Baocheng, Zhang Jianren, Ye Zhisheng, and Deng Yuanhe, to serve as free diagnosis volunteers. In addition, the association, in response to the request of fellow villagers, has invited Dr. Wang Jiyan to serve as a free diagnosis volunteer and has reduced the diagnosis fees. However, it is limited to ten numbers per day. A special registration office has been set up at the association to show the difference. Those who register through the association and go to Dr. Wang's clinic at 24 Jinfuli, intersection of Avenue Joffre and Datong Road, will be charged only 1 yuan and 2 jiao for the consultation fee, reducing it by three-quarters from the original 4 yuan and 8 jiao, in order to benefit the poor and sick. If the patient is seriously ill and cannot go out, they can also make a house call as usual, and the consultation fee will be reduced uniformly.</p>
<p>▲ Pediatrician Ren Nongxuan's Busy Clinic Since the beginning of summer in this city, the weather has been erratic, with a long drought and no rain, and it is extremely hot, leading to the proliferation of diseases, especially among infants.

<h3 id="e195">Incoming Correspondence: The Functions of the Salt Affairs Auditing Office and its Relationship to Reorganizing Salt Affairs <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>During the years 1934 and 1935, official systems were established. The central government set up the Salt Affairs Bureau and the General Auditing Office, both under the Ministry of Finance. Each salt-producing area had a Salt Transport Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, and branch auditing offices. Each salt-selling area had a Salt Monopoly Bureau and an auditing office, or a tax collection bureau, separately subordinate to the Salt Affairs Bureau and the General Auditing Office. Thus, salt affairs were divided into two major parts, separated into administration and auditing. The administrative organs were in charge of matters related to field production, transportation, sales, and anti-smuggling. The auditing organs were in charge of matters related to collecting salt taxes, weighing and releasing salt, and compiling reports. This not only created redundant structures but also caused many constraints. It not only wasted expenses but also greatly hindered the reorganization of salt affairs. Fundamentally, it was already a mistake. The biggest reasons for this were two-fold:</p>
<p>From the perspective of political principles, the main purpose of salt administration is tax collection. If there were no salt tax, what salt affairs would there be? Salt is produced in the fields and sold on the shore. Its source is entirely in production, and its destination is entirely in sales. "There must be annual production for annual sales, and only then can there be annual sales tax." If there is no place to sell the salt, where does the tax come from? The key to production and sales lies entirely in transportation. No matter who wants to transport salt, they must pay taxes according to regulations before it can be weighed and released. Salt with tax is called official salt, and salt without tax is called smuggled salt. If the official cannot defeat the smuggled, tax revenue will be lost. Preventing smuggling depends on anti-smuggling. Anti-smuggling is for protecting taxes. Therefore, field affairs, transportation affairs, and anti-smuggling affairs are all established for tax affairs. The root of salt tax lies entirely in field production and transportation and sales. The matter is very complex, and it is best to have specialists. It is completely different from ordinary tax collection. Therefore, tax affairs and administrative affairs cannot be absolutely separated. This is the first mistake.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the history of official systems, China's salt affairs have had special officials since the Han and Tang dynasties. In the Han dynasty, the Grand Minister of Agriculture was in charge of salt affairs, which was the beginning of salt affairs belonging to the Ministry of Finance. (In the Han system, the Grand Minister of Agriculture's duties were like those of today's Minister of Finance. Under the Grand Minister of Agriculture, an independent organization was formed, with a Salt Commissioner in charge of national salt affairs.) In the Song dynasty, the Left Secretary of the Ministry of Revenue was in charge of checking salt taxes to understand their increase and decrease, which was the beginning of salt affairs auditing. (In the Song system, the Ministry of Revenue was in charge of checking the amount of national salt tax, which is the function of today's auditing office. "Checking" is the earliest term for auditing.) From the Ming and Qing dynasties onwards, each province's salt taxes were audited by the Ministry of Revenue, which is how the name of auditing originated. Since the Song dynasty, the highest administrative organ in the central government has been in charge of auditing matters. All production and sales figures were subject to auditing, not just tax revenue. Auditing salt tax was an important administrative task. In the early years of the Republic of China, forcibly dividing production, sales, transportation, and anti-smuggling into administrative affairs was already far from the principles of the official system. This is another mistake.</p>
<p>Reorganizing salt affairs was originally intended to eliminate accumulated malpractices and increase tax revenue. However, because the division of powers was fundamentally flawed, all issues related to the rectification of field production, the transformation of transportation and sales, and the improvement of anti-smuggling are closely related to the collection of salt taxes. The auditing side must consult with the administrative side. However, matters related to administration should be handled by the administrative organs. But administrative personnel are limited by bad habits, content with corruption, or vehemently opposed due to differences in opinion, disputes over authority, or greed for kickbacks. They may even outwardly agree but secretly sabotage. Often, the obstruction of one matter leads to many obstacles for the whole. Although it is said that during the years 1934, 1935, and 1936, the auditing side was determined to make progress on reorganization issues, and tax revenue increased year by year, achieving some results, the lack of unified authority made progress difficult. Everything was handled piecemeal, and there was never a complete reform.</p>
<p>In 1931, it was recognized that anti-smuggling affairs were related to tax revenue and should be reorganized urgently. Therefore, in March of that year, they were placed under the jurisdiction of the General and Branch Auditing Offices. After taking over, the existing anti-smuggling troops were reorganized into tax police, and the regimental system was changed to a district system. Serious rectification and strict training were carried out. The various bad habits of previous anti-smuggling efforts were gradually eliminated, and the investigation of smuggled salt was quite effective. In 1932, it was also recognized that the reorganization of salt affairs required unified authority and the elimination of accumulated malpractices, as well as the elimination of redundant personnel and the reduction of expenses. Therefore, in July of that year, the administrative organs were reorganized so that auditing personnel would also hold administrative positions. After taking over, the first step was to strictly eliminate all kinds of existing corrupt practices. In fact, the biggest malpractice on the administrative side was the collection of kickbacks. The corruption of salt administration was also due to this. Now that authority is unified, the reorganization of field production, transportation, and sales is carried out simultaneously, aiming to achieve a complete reform. Although it has not been long since the concurrent management began, the results are already considerable. In 1929, tax revenue was 85 million yuan. In 1933, it increased to 159 million yuan. If the three northeastern provinces were included, it would be 184 million yuan, more than double compared to 1929 (see attached Table 1).</p>
<p>Whether the auditing office concurrently manages salt administration and anti-smuggling has a significant relationship with the increase in tax revenue. The eleven districts where the auditing office concurrently managed salt administration and anti-smuggling saw an increase of over 21 million yuan in tax revenue compared to 1931 and 1933, while the eight districts where the auditing office did not concurrently manage saw an increase of only over 2 million yuan (see attached Table 2).</p>
<p>After the auditing office concurrently managed administration, the administrative expenses of each district were greatly reduced. The administrative expenses of the eleven districts of Huainan, Huaibei, Songjiang, Liangzhe, Shandong, Fujian, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi in 1931 were 2.8 million yuan. After the administrative merger, the budget for 1933 was reduced to 730,000 yuan. In comparison, there was a reduction of 2.15 million yuan (see attached Table 3). However, as mentioned above, the tax revenue of these eleven districts increased by over 21 million yuan compared to 1931 and 1933. The tax revenue of the eight districts where the auditing office did not concurrently manage administration in 1933 was 43 million yuan, only one-third of the eleven districts where the auditing office concurrently managed administration (the tax revenue of the eleven districts was 115 million yuan), while the administrative expenses were four times higher (in 1933, the administrative expenses of the eight districts that did not concurrently manage administration were 2.83 million yuan, while the eleven districts that concurrently managed administration were 730,000 yuan (see attached Table 4)). For example, the expenses of the Guangdong district's transportation commissioner's office alone reached 750,000 yuan per year, exceeding the total administrative expenses of the eleven districts that concurrently managed administration. If one does not want to reorganize salt affairs, then so be it. If one wants to reorganize salt affairs, increase revenue, reduce expenditure, and eliminate accumulated malpractices, salt administration should naturally be merged into the auditing office.</p>
<p>Since the auditing office concurrently managed the administration of eleven districts, the reduction in administrative expenses has been as described above. The auditing expenses of the auditing office itself have also decreased without increasing:</p>
<p>1931: 8,431,000 yuan</p>
<p>1932: 8,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>1933: 7,321,000 yuan</p>
<p>Comparing the expenses of the auditing office itself with tax revenue, it only accounts for slightly more than 4%, which is also less than the auditing office in the Beijing era (see attached diagram).</p>
<p>Before the auditing office concurrently managed anti-smuggling in the eleven districts of Shandong, Huaibei, Huainan, Songjiang, Liangzhe, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, and Fujian, there were over 21,000 officials and police officers in 1929, with annual expenses of over 3.81 million yuan. After the auditing office concurrently managed, in 1933, the number of officials and police officers was reduced to over 15,000, with expenses of 3.91 million yuan. In comparison, the number of people decreased, but expenses increased. This was due to improving the treatment of police officers to encourage integrity. However, based on the experience of recent years, the number of anti-smuggling personnel and expenses must be increased in order to increase the effectiveness of anti-smuggling. After the construction of warehouses and the management of field affairs in each district are perfected in the future, the anti-smuggling police force and expenses can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>In summary, the reorganization of salt affairs is to increase tax revenue. The first step is to eliminate accumulated malpractices. Moreover, from the perspective of political principles and the history of official systems, the key to salt affairs is tax collection, and auditing tax revenue is an important administrative task. The so-called field production, transportation, sales, and anti-smuggling are all matters that the auditing organs should handle. How can redundant organs be established outside the auditing office? What should be urgently corrected is that now that the specialized merchant system has not been abolished, the name of the administrative organ still exists. It should be merged and further reformed.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>So what exactly were the "main courses," numbering a hundred, and the "snacks," numbering forty or fifty? I really can't give you a detailed answer! Because there were really too many varieties of dishes eaten in the palace, and even in the carts there were quite a few, so it's definitely not something that ordinary people can remember. I said earlier that Chinese food is a "practical science" with a very wide scope, so how could I possibly remember so much?</p>
<p>Let me give a few examples: For example, clear-stewed fat duck was a dish that the Empress Dowager loved to eat very much. The way it was cooked was to first remove the feathers and liver from the duck, wash it clean, and then add some seasonings, and put it in a porcelain jar; then put this porcelain jar in an iron pot filled with half clear water, tightly cover the pot to prevent the air from escaping, and just let it simmer on low heat for three days in a row, so that the duck is completely tender, so tender that you don't need to cut it with a knife, you just need to use chopsticks to pick it up, and you can easily break it open. Then you can feast on it! Although the Empress Dowager sometimes picked up some duck meat to eat, she mostly picked up the duck skin to eat; because that layer of duck skin was the most exquisite and delicious part of this dish.</p>
<p>In addition to the clear-stewed fat duck, the following dishes were also commonly found on the Empress Dowager's table, and were also some of her favorites.</p>
<p>Smoked and roasted things seemed to suit the Empress Dowager's taste the most, like roast duck, roast suckling pig, smoked chicken, braised lamb leg, etc., which were almost constantly being served. These things are certainly not rare items, and ordinary people can enjoy them in restaurants outside, but the cooking method in the palace is generally more elaborate than outside. According to the Empress Dowager herself, the dish she loved to eat the most when she was young was roast pork skin. The way it was cooked was to first cut the pork with skin into small square pieces, and then fry them in lard, until the skin on the meat was crispier than anything else, and its taste was really enough to make people drool.

<h3 id="e197">A Woman's Buttons <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Sharp</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Provincial Government, acting on the orders of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, has formulated measures to ban women's strange and unusual clothing, with detailed regulations on women's attire; but it does not mention the button issue on cheongsams.</p>
<p>The number of buttons on a woman's cheongsam is countless, and I can't say the exact number. Because none of my female friends are willing to let me count them slowly. Although there are often women standing and watching outside the display windows of large companies, I sometimes want to pay attention and count, but I am nearsighted and have slow vision, and often when I am about to finish counting, she leaves again. So I have long wanted to count the number of buttons on a woman's cheongsam, but I can never fulfill my wish. A friend (of course, a male friend) told me that he counted seventeen pairs of buttons on a certain lady's cheongsam, and his eyesight is better than mine, so he is probably not wrong.</p>
<p>The function of buttons is simply to prevent clothes from loosening, and six pairs are enough for our men's long gowns. Why must there be as many as seventeen pairs? Moreover, if a tailor makes more buttons, it will cost more effort, and the wages will increase accordingly. The price of a single shirt is as high as three or four yuan, which has a great impact on the wearer's own material resources! Also, it takes a lot of time to button and unbutton them when wearing. I think that in today's complex society, we should standardize the things we use by simplifying them, and use the time saved to do something beneficial. Like Japanese clothing, it is finished with just a belt. Westerners also don't have many buttons, which may also express their national character, not willing to waste time.</p>
<p>Ming Xie Jin's poem "On the Buttons of Palace Women" is quite humorous. It is recorded as follows: "A piece of silk gauze cut from plain silk; the beauty's figure surpasses Chang'e. If the spring heart is willing to be locked up firmly, why use so many buttons?" I don't know if the women of today like to have more buttons because they want to firmly lock up the spring heart.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Old Tales of Goldfish <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Raising goldfish is indeed a very poetic hobby. My old friends Shou Juan and Ji Ren both have a goldfish addiction. Shou Juan even matches the fish's form and color with the names of ci poem patterns, which is even more interesting.</p>
<p>Song Yue Ke's Cheng Shi says: "Today, there are fish farmers in Zhongdu who can change fish to golden color, crucian carp are the best, followed by carp. Wealthy nobles often carefully dig stone to make ponds, placing them between the eaves and windows for enjoyment. When asked about the technique, they secretly refuse to tell. Some say that feeding ordinary fish with small red worms purchased from the market for a hundred days will make them all like this, first white like silver, then gradually yellow, and after a long time golden. I have not had time to verify whether it is true or not." This passage is too unscientific. Golden crucian carp and golden carp have their own seeds, and they will definitely not change color by eating small red worms. It also says: "When Ni Xi returned to Sichuan, he drew lake water and floated it on three giant ships to follow, with strange and magnificent appearances, not just two kinds." Xi was Qin Hui's son. Carrying fish from Hangzhou to Sichuan on giant ships can be considered a fish-loving addiction, unmatched throughout the ages.</p>
<p>Goldfish are seen in odes and poems. Su Zimei's "Leaning on the Pine Bridge, I Tap it and Watch the Golden Crucian Carp, Lingering Alone All Day Long." Su Dongpo's "I Know the Goldfish of Nanping." Before that, there were probably more, but I have not seen them.</p>
<p>Xiang Lian Lou's diary says: "Zuo Jigaofu raised a tank of goldfish, using the number of offspring as a sign of the prosperity of his disciples, a year with many offspring, his father would count and say that so-and-so should enter school, but not Jigaofu. Zuo was nine years old, very angry, and took advantage of the gap to kill all the fish in the tank. When his father questioned him, he replied with the truth." Treating goldfish as a tortoise shell for divination of the success of his disciples is also a strange idea. That young master, believing it to be true, vented his anger on the fish, which is even more bizarre. It is a great misfortune for goldfish to have such an encounter. Jigaofu's words and deeds throughout his life were somewhat spicy, and there is already a hint of it here.</p>
<p>These days, the south is experiencing the plum rain season, and the torturous period for goldfish has arrived. If you are not careful, they will get sick. The goldfish market in the old capital is very prosperous. There is no plum rain season there, so they probably won't be tortured by the yellow plum weather. In the year I first arrived in Suzhou, I also raised a tank of goldfish, and they were all sacrificed to the yellow plum weather within two or three days. So Zuo Jigaofu can be said to have a yellow plum temper, haha!</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Although I can't paint, I quite like to talk about painting theory with several friends who are painters. The other day, I met Mr. Tao Lengyue at a banquet. Not only has he reached a high peak in technique, but his theoretical aspect is also quite developed. He said: "Ordinary people often use the words 'vivid' and 'lively' to praise paintings, but in fact, stillness is better than movement, and the skill of stillness is better than movement. Therefore, to use an idiom, it can be said that it is better to be still than to move. Moreover, people's hearts are still not tired of chaos, and the great war is imminent. When the time comes, the lives of the people will be devastated, and the material losses will be unimaginable. Then, this murderous intent is hidden in the word 'movement.' If we then add fuel to the fire between silk and plain, making the prelude to movement, this is absolutely impossible. Therefore, my paintings are always a cool moon, silently illuminating the mountains and rivers, causing people to silently contemplate and dispel all thoughts of fame, profit, contention, and contention, as if using still paintings to pray for world peace." I couldn't help but agree with him after hearing this theory.</p>
<p>He once traveled far to Sichuan last year, and took a detour through the seven lakes of Xiaoxiang, climbing Mount Heng of Southern Yue. Because his paintings are mostly scenes of quiet nights with bright moons, he spent the night on the banks of the Jialing River and at the top of Mount Zhurong, completing dozens or hundreds of drafts. This time, he held an exhibition at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge, and Chinese and Western people all admired it, which shows that the help of the landscape is not only true for Sima's writing.</p>

<p>Chapter 31: Three Battles, White-Clad Men Charge Through the Snow Formation, the Entire Battalion Dies for their Country, Red-Eyed Men Enter the Gun Forest</p>
<p>Zi Qiang led his brothers into the ravine, and the sun had already turned a ghastly red, setting west over the mountain peaks. The ravine was gloomy and cold, and a chill attacked them. Everyone walked in the snow, their feet completely buried in it. No one spoke, only the sound of footsteps pulling and stepping in the snow, which added to the silence of the environment. Zi Qiang walked to a protruding cliff and called his brothers to shrink to the bottom of the cliff together. This was a sheltered place, and although there were still a few inches of snow on the ground, there was no wind cutting into their skin, which made them feel much more comfortable. The brothers had always only known to obey orders, where to go, what to do, was not allowed to be asked. So at this time, the brothers followed Zi Qiang's orders and entered the bottom of the protruding cliff together. Everyone thought, why abandon such good fortifications in the fortress and run into this ravine? And now there is not a ghost of the enemy in sight, why hide like this? But the commander's orders are correct, and no one can outwardly show a suspicious attitude. It was also at this time that Zi Qiang suddenly showed a tense attitude, shouting repeatedly: Lie down! Lie down! Everyone had walked with great difficulty in the deep snow to get here, and was really a little tired. Having the opportunity to rest, the ranks were also scattered. At this time, hearing the order to lie down, they also knew that danger was coming. Everyone lay down in the snow in a flurry. Zhao Ziqiang himself, regardless of the depth of the snow, also lay down with them. Because after the company commander lay down, he didn't make any noise, so everyone was quiet, and their minds calmed down, and their five senses could work. At this time, they discovered the rattling sound of an airplane vibrating in the air. The sound gradually increased, and finally it sounded over their heads. Although this was a ravine, when they raised their heads, they could still see a seam of blue sky. At this time, the plane flew very low, swooping past the top of the mountain seam. (421)</p>
<h3 id="e202">"Name" and "Reality" <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>

<p>When Zhuge Jing was in Wu, during a grand court meeting, Sun Hao asked, "Your name is Zhongsi, what do you think about?" He replied, "At home, I think of filial piety, serving the ruler, I think of loyalty, friends, I think of faith, that's all!"</p>
<p>This is a pedantic talk that ordinary people today would disdain. But I must advise those who have the same status as Zhuge Jing not to use names that are too "magnificent," such as ritual, righteousness, integrity, and loyalty, because if you happen to meet a fool like Sun Hao, you might not be able to talk as loudly as Zhuge Jing!</p>

<h3 id="e203">Animals Forecast Weather <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Today, science is flourishing, and the method of observing the weather is of course based on astronomy. However, in the era when science was not developed, the changes in the weather were predicted solely by the movements of animals. Among the animals, birds, beasts, insects, and fish, many can occupy the clear or rainy weather, based on the principles of meteorology, from the temperature, humidity, air pressure, and sunlight conditions, and have been repeatedly tested and proven. They are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Goldfish: If we use a goldfish tank that is one foot and five inches deep and six inches in diameter, pave the bottom of the tank with yellow sand, plant aquatic plants, fill the tank with eight-tenths of water, and put in two or three three-year-old goldfish, still follow the ordinary goldfish breeding method, without any difference, then we can judge the weather from the living conditions of the goldfish. For example, if you want to go out in the future, if you want to know if it will rain, you can see it in the goldfish tank. If the weather will be clear, the water in the fish tank contains enough oxygen, and the goldfish must be steadily and quietly submerged at the bottom of the tank. If the air gradually becomes humid, as if it is about to rain, the goldfish will have difficulty absorbing oxygen in the water, and will gradually float to the top, even stretching its mouth out of the water to absorb oxygen, and its breathing will be very rapid, then, after three or four hours, it will definitely rain. This method is most effective from May to October. However, the tank and the number of fish stocked must be in accordance with the above. If the tank is small and there are many fish, and no aquatic plants are planted, the weather cannot be predicted. (If the tank is small and there are many fish, the oxygen in the water cannot be supplied for life, and they will also float to the surface.) However, why should aquatic plants be planted at the bottom of the goldfish tank? It is not just for decoration, because aquatic plants are plants that absorb a large amount of air from outside the water, take nitrogen as their own nutrients, digest and absorb it, and release oxygen into the water. Therefore, no matter how high the water temperature rises, if the weather is not bad, the goldfish will still benefit from this oxygen, and even if the tank water is not changed, they will still live quietly submerged at the bottom of the water. Therefore, with the remedy of aquatic plants, they get a lot of oxygen. In the past, old fishermen used this goldfish weather forecast to infer the life of fish in rivers. In clear weather, fish must swim at the bottom of the water, and the fishing hook bait should be submerged at the bottom of the water. If it is about to rain, because the fish have difficulty breathing, they will float to the surface of the water, and the fishing hook bait should of course float on the surface. Thinking about it this way, raising goldfish can not only determine whether the weather is clear or rainy, but also serve as a guide for fishing.</p>
<p>Frogs: The sound of frogs croaking is most effective in relation to rain. According to the experiments of Mr. Maeda, director of the Osaka Meteorological Observatory in Japan, it will rain within 30 hours after a frog croaks. He experimented in the Obihiro area and got a score of 64%, in Wakayama, he got a score of 70%, and in Shiomisaki, he got a score of 52%. The average statistic is 62% effective, so the frog is also known as the rain frog.</p>
<p>Cats and Dogs: When a cat strokes its ears with its forelimbs (from behind the ears to the face), it is a sign that the weather will be clear. If both cats and dogs eat grass, it can be predicted that it will rain.</p>
<p>Chickens: If chickens wander around foraging non-stop from morning till night, it is a sign of rain.</p>
<p>Sparrows: If yellow sparrows bathe in the river, it is a sign of clear weather.</p>
<p>Swallows: If swallows dance high in the sky, it is a sign that the weather will be clear. Flying low in the sky and eagerly foraging for food is a sign of rain.</p>
<p>Ants: If termites come out, it is proof that the weather will continue to be unchanged.</p>
<p>Snakes: If snakes climb trees, it is a sign of rain.</p>
<p>Earthworms: If earthworms chirp, it is a sign of clear weather.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently announced the County Treasury System, which, starting from July 1st, will unify the revenue and expenditure of various funds in each county, including educational funding, under the management of the County Treasury. The educational associations of Songjiang, Shanghai, and other counties, upon hearing this news, are deeply concerned that the principle of independent educational funding will be undermined, thus shaking the original educational undertakings. Therefore, they held a temporary discussion meeting at the Shanghai County Party Headquarters yesterday. More than twenty people attended, including Chen Guisan from Songjiang, Sun Jichu from Shanghai, Lu Yunqi from Jiading, Zhao Yancang from Qingpu, Zhao Shouheng from Kunshan, Lin Baoheng from Fengxian, and Zhao Xinmei from Nanhui. Sun Jichu was elected as the chairman, and Lu Yangzhou as the recorder. After the formalities, the chairman reported the main purpose of the meeting, followed by discussion on: (1) The County Treasury System promulgated by the Provincial Government's Finance Department this time incorporates educational funding into administrative expenses, undermining the principle of independent educational funding and affecting educational undertakings. How should the association strive to protect the independent educational funding? It was decided to send a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government's Nanchang Headquarters, the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Education, and the Provincial Party Headquarters for correction, and also to send a telegram to the Provincial Government's Education Department requesting a reconsideration at the Provincial Government meeting to change the method in order to maintain independent educational funding.

Banks Closed for Settlement on July 2nd and 3rd. <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>The gold market continued to decline yesterday due to the simultaneous rise in silver prices and exchange rates. At one point, the market became extremely weak due to rumors circulating about silver. However, major players bought during the dip, and banks also actively purchased at the lower prices. Signs of a rebound appeared after the decline. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets in England and America both rose, and the futures silver price on the Five Metals Exchange also rose by 0.18 to 0.41 cents. Exchange rates increased across the board. London spot gold fell by one penny, American cotton fell by nine basis points, American wheat remained unchanged, and stock prices experienced minor fluctuations. The tentative opening price retreated to a strong $8, but then rose due to more active buying during the dip. After the opening, although banks were keen to purchase, market sentiment was weak, and the domestic market tended to loosen. The market situation seemed weak. At one point, major players strongly supported purchases, which were quite effective in preventing further decline. Later, upon learning of the HSBC exchange rate listing, the British exchange rate rose by 1.25 and the American exchange rate rose by 3.75, triggering intense selling pressure and causing the price to retreat. However, it did not break the $8 mark, leading to bargain hunting. Major players also made strong purchases. The gold market suddenly rebounded. After entering the market, banks' appetite waned, and Sassoon strongly covered bills, causing the domestic market to continue to harden. Sellers asserted their dominance, breaking the $80 mark. Although there was a pull-up, ultimately, the Reuters report stating that the US Internal Revenue Committee instructed silver brokers with long positions to have their customers swear and fill out explanations did not have a significant impact. Furthermore, the US Congressman Dies announced that he would propose a bill in the next Congress to reduce the silver content of currency from 412.5 to 206 grains, similar to reducing the gold content, and also proposed restoring the old gold-silver ratio of 16 to 1 to replace the current 27 to 1. The gold market fell further, but stabilized due to banks taking advantage of the low prices to purchase. A report from the Seattle night market stated that the silver price had decreased by 0.25 and increased by 1.25, boosting market sentiment and pushing the price back above $80. However, the supply side was still eager to sell at the higher prices, causing it to decline. The bank market was very good. Reuters reported that the US government had decided to engage in a large-scale silver purchasing campaign, buying 135.4 million ounces in the next six months. The gold market remained high but still experienced a slight decline. In the after-market, although the Seattle night market silver price rose by 0.25, remained unchanged, and rose by 1.25, the price once retreated below $80. However, due to the banks' strong appetite, it gradually rose, and the market situation stabilized. The price of pure gold was calculated at $990.70. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was $981.70, a decrease of $5 from the previous close. Goods opened at $1.50. In the morning market, the near-term selling price for the British exchange rate was 1 shilling 4 pence 1.875, and the American exchange rate was $34.0625. Yifeng, Yonghong, and Xing all advanced. The market was stable, but due to Zhengchang, Dafa, and Yongli selling, market sentiment remained cautious and retreated from $1.80 to $0.50. Although the exchange rate market hardened, banks were still absorbing. Dadecheng, Dingkang, Tongtaichang, Yongfeng, Yuanyuan, Bingxing, Yifeng, Yong, etc., were still keen to buy and rose to $2.40. Upon learning that the HSBC exchange rate listing showed the British exchange rate rising by 1.25 and the American exchange rate rising by 3.75, Yuqing, Yongyuan, Maoyong, Tongsheng, and Chunlai sold, causing the price to fall to $80. Banks were still purchasing October American dollars at half a dollar. Daxing, Yongyuan, Yibingxing, Yongli, etc., made strong purchases, causing it to rise to $3. Afterwards, market sentiment was weak, and Reuters reported news about silver, causing the domestic market to suddenly loosen. October American dollars at 56.15 were sold. Senchang, Yongdafa, Yongheng, Yuda, Xingyong, Hongli, Zhaofengchang, etc., competed to sell, breaking the $80 mark and falling to $78.80. Yongli, Qingfa, Yongzhengchang, Yuqingyong, etc., took advantage of the low prices to purchase, rising to $80.09. Soon after, Reuters transmitted unfavorable news about restoring the original gold-silver ratio of 16 to 1 to replace the current 27 to 1, causing market sentiment to become cautious. Tianfeng, Yongfu, Yuzhaofengchang, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Hengchang, Yonghongli, etc., jointly sold, gradually decreasing to $77.40. HSBC purchased October American dollars at $0.6875, stabilizing the market. Hengyu, Xinchan, Lifuyu, etc., bought, and subsequently rose to $80. Furthermore, reports from the Seattle night market showed that the silver price had decreased by 0.15, increased by 1.25, and decreased by 0.15, boosting market sentiment. Fuxing, Yongyuan, Maoyong, Dadecheng, Yongde, Tongyishengkang, etc., continuously purchased, causing it to rebound to $82.40. HSBC absorbed October American dollars at $0.625. At the same time, some banks also absorbed $0.5625. Fuyu repeatedly sold, and Yongli and Dafa Yong also sold, gradually decreasing to $0.04. However, Hengyu, Yifengyong, Qianchang, Xianghui, Xiangdadecheng, etc., bought, causing it to rise to $2.80. But silver news continued to circulate, and Shunmao, Shunli, etc., sold at the higher prices, causing it to decrease to $1.20. The noon closing price was $981.40, and goods were auctioned at $1.20.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $98.30, and goods opened at $1.10. Because the Seattle night market silver price had rebounded by 0.25, Hengyu, Yiyu, Shenkang, Changsheng Yong, etc., sold, causing it to fall to $79.70. Huabi purchased October American dollars at $0.625, and Yuqingyong, Fuxingyong, Dadecheng, etc., purchased, causing it to rise to $81.70. Hengyu, Fuyu, Zhaofengchang, etc., supplied at the higher prices, decreasing by $1. However, because the banks' appetite remained strong, Fuxingyongda, Lianbang, Maoyong, Yuanhengsun, Maofuyu, Dadecheng, etc., were very keen to buy, causing it to rise to $2.70. Yongli, Yingfeng, Hengda, Xingyong sold, decreasing to $2. However, because Dadecheng etc., were still absorbing, the situation was stable, fluctuating until the 4 o'clock closing price was $982.20. Goods were auctioned at $2.50. After the closing, Fuxingyongda, Dadecheng, Shunli, etc., advanced to $3. Retail investors also purchased, causing it to rise above $3. Shunli, Yuqingyong, Zhengchangyong, and Yongli sold, causing it to decrease again to within $3. The highest price for the day was $983, and the lowest price was $977.40, fluctuating by $5.60. As a result, it continued to fall by $4.50 compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was $33.625, with the HSBC American exchange rate listed as increasing by $3.75, equivalent to a spot gold price of $1029. Based on the closing price, the margin was approximately $47, approximately $7 less than the previous close. The July accounting price was $981, and the August accounting price was $981. The morning additional payment was $981, and the afternoon additional payment was $982. The price of pure gold was calculated at $990.70. Trading in the market was average. Tianjin goods were priced at an additional $10 and sold by the Tianjin gang to Yingfeng Heng for approximately 1,700 taels. Rumors suggest that the Central Bank opened spot bidding, but this was not confirmed. There was a lack of swap transactions, with the short side generally paying forward one dollar. As of today, there are still 5,411 July contracts remaining, with 12 long positions and 14 short positions.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was blurred. In summary, Dingkang, Hongxing, Wanxing, Yifengyong, Fuchang, Hongxingyong, Bingxing, Chengkang, Yongli, Yuanyuan, Qingfayongheng, Taichunyuan, Yongzhaofengchang, etc., were on the buying side. Senchangyong, Shenkang, Yuanmaoyong, Futaiheng, Huixiang, Dafayong, Dadecheng, Hongkangyong, Zhengchang, Hongli, Yuankangxiang, Yingfenghong, etc., were on the selling side.

<h3 id="e237">British and American Exchange Rates Continue to Harden <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>

<h3 id="e238">Banks Busy with Year-End Closings ▲ Many Collections: Interbank Lending Remains the Same <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>As the end of the half-year major closing period for the banking industry has arrived, all mutual transactions must be fully settled. Therefore, collections have gradually increased this week, causing market transactions to become scattered due to a lack of time. Most market conditions remain the same. For example, the interbank lending rate still opens at 0.6% in the morning and afternoon and has remained unchanged for many days. Overdrafts and water additions continue to be written off. For interbank bill transactions, there were over 4.4 million in morning transfers and new transactions, over 500,000 in afternoon transactions, and over 300,000 in small clearinghouse transactions. Foreign collateralized loan transactions involved over 1.1 million in redemptions and over 1.4 million in new loans, with over 500,000 in cash collections. Silver dollar collections are usually prosperous, especially for settlements, with foreign banks collecting over 4.4 million in bills, over 3.2 million in settlements, over 700,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 5.6 million in various goods, foreign exchange, collateralized, and miscellaneous collections, with 400,000 leaving the warehouse. Chinese banks collected over 4.4 million in bills, over 3.8 million in settlements, over 5.4 million in various goods, foreign exchange, collateralized, and miscellaneous collections, over 800,000 in customs duties, and 600,000 entering the warehouse.

<h3 id="e239">Jiangsu Corners Continue to be Slightly Stable <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>

The morning opening price was 829 dollars, and the afternoon closing price was 9 dollars lower, at 820 dollars. There were 5,000 corners of transactions in the morning and 2,000 corners of transactions in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver dollars were 729.5 dollars in the morning, 0.5 dollars lower than the previous market, and rebounded by 0.5 dollars in the afternoon, to 730 dollars.

Copper coins were 333,000 cash in the morning and afternoon, 1,500 cash higher than the previous day, with transactions worth 12,000 foreign exchange dollars, amounting to 39,960 strings.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Securities The June Bond Delivery Went Very Smoothly ▲Total Amount: 15,516,500 Yuan▲ <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, June 28th, was the delivery date for the June futures of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The total delivery amount was 35,516,500 yuan. Among this, 27,695,000 yuan was settled by the brokers themselves through mutual account transfers, and only 7,470,000 yuan was delivered at the exchange. The amount of off-exchange deliveries is unknown, but it should also be in the range of 20 to 30 million yuan. The delivery went quite smoothly. On the receiving end, most were arbitrageurs from the financial sector, while the deliverers were mostly retail investors. After reviewing the June futures, from its launch on April 28th to June 25th, the performance was generally good, with market prices continuing to rise. On April 28th, the salt tax was 51.2 yuan, the gold short was 64.7 yuan, demobilization was 71.3 yuan, and the Sixth Consolidated was 58.1 yuan. From June 22nd to 25th, the salt tax was 58.8 yuan, the gold short was 77 yuan, demobilization was 78.6 yuan, and the Sixth Consolidated was 66.8 yuan. The difference between the highs and lows ranged from over 7 yuan to over 12 yuan. Among the government bonds, the gold short rose the most, by 12.3 yuan, while demobilization only rose by 7.3 yuan, a difference of 5 yuan. The salt tax rose by 7.6 yuan, and the Sixth Consolidated rose by 10.07 yuan, both falling far short. The process was quite simple. After Japan rescinded its statement on April 28th, international tensions gradually subsided. After an initial rise in market prices, they entered a period of consolidation. Market sentiment was weak, and people were inactive, with very little fluctuation. However, around May 28th, hedging activities gradually increased, and the stagnant situation began to break. Market prices then gradually rose. After the gold short reached a new high on May 30th, the upward trend in market prices became even stronger, with new highs appearing frequently. On June 11th, the disappearance of Kuramoto was reported to the market. Although it suffered a setback, Kuramoto was found on the 13th. After this suppression, the force of the sharp rise in market prices became even more intense, soaring and continuing to advance, resulting in the latest high records from June 22nd to 25th, breaking the high price records of April 2nd. Unified salt taxes all exceeded 70%, with hopes of reaching 75%. The Sixth Consolidated reached 69 yuan, with hopes of reaching 70 yuan. Recently, in the past day or two, due to the sale of a large batch of spot goods, the 20-year disaster relief government bonds were priced at 77 yuan. The settlement of spot goods also showed signs of activity, but market prices did not fall sharply as a result and even seemed to be mitigating the effect, indicating that the situation had not changed fundamentally. The influx of spot goods was only temporarily affected and could not suppress the high morale. The following is a list of the account transfers and total transaction amounts for June futures (unit: hundreds of yuan):</p>

<p>According to the Wall Street Journal, Shinfeng Yanghang announced that yesterday (the 27th), the stock market initially became active because the Penn Central Railroad declared a dividend of half a yuan. The price of Holmes Stake Mining reached 410 yuan. According to rumors, if the price is high, each share may be split into multiple shares. However, some believe that this will not happen. Later, the market widely rumored that official Pan Kela would become a member of the Securities Exchange Management Committee. Since Pan Kela has always been the most forceful opponent of speculation, the market became sluggish again. The small exchange was slightly firm, bonds were mixed, and miscellaneous grains also saw mixed fluctuations. Field news was still bullish, but people's interest was very low. The total trading volume for the day was 630,000 shares. According to a report from the company's New York agent, the line of least resistance (securities) is still upward, but there is no real stimulus, and the public is taking a wait-and-see attitude. (Wheat) Farmers are selling hedges, and the bulls have unloaded their positions, so the market should tend to rise. Corn should improve next week, with rain and cooler weather. (Cotton) The market has rebounded slightly. This week's production report is slightly better than generally predicted. Current sales are sluggish, and the foundation is firm. Pay attention to the weather in Texas, which has little damage now, but if it continues to be dry, there will be significant damage. The weather in the region is quite good. (Rubber) The market is mediocre. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3 id="e242">Yarn Market Suffers Pressure from Massive Sales <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to weaken, and the decline intensified again. Due to the hot weather and stagnant customer sales, and the large amount of short selling by Japanese merchants, the pressure was very heavy. However, large investors slightly released some of their absorption volume. At the same time, cotton prices also loosened, causing the closely related yarn market to become even weaker.</p>
<p>Gold Difficult to Fall More Than Two Yuan The pre-market opening price of standard yarn was affected by the decline of American cotton by 10 basis points. There was a lack of buyers in the market. It was heard that the news about spot yarn in the market was not good, and all months fell by 7.8 jiao. When the market was auctioned to the second and third sessions, the Japanese yarn market was still weak, with more shorts cutting their losses, and the market became more depressed. The second and third sessions continued to decline, resulting in a drop of 1.5, 6, and 8 jiao for each month. In the afternoon, it was heard that the spot yarn sales market was cold and the counter was still loose, and each session was tired, with each month falling by 6.7 jiao. The total transaction statistics for the day were 58,850 bales. It was found that Dafeng sold 4,300 bales, Chunji 1,250 bales, Shenji 1,000 bales, Taichang 1,250 bales, Changfeng 900 bales, Huikang 1,200 bales, Gengfeng 800 bales, Junchang 800 bales, Yiyu 800 bales, Renfeng 1,100 bales, and Xincheng 1,700 bales. Yicheng bought 1,200 bales, Yuanfeng 2,050 bales, Jinchang 800 bales, Yuanji 2,600 bales, Yuanda 1,650 bales, Shenchang 1,500 bales, and Hengchang 2,400 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Open Interest</p>
<p>July 181.8 180.3 180.3 Down 2.30 57,200</p>
<p>August 183.6 182.0 182.0 2.4 82,150</p>

<p>November 185.6 183.2 184.2 2.10 47,550</p>
<p>Total 319,100</p>
<p>Yarn Sales 400 Bales Spot yarn sales were quite sluggish. It was found that the total purchase statistics of each gang for the whole day were only 401 bales. The market fell by more than 1 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Xiamen 20 Ningbo 8 Nanjing 6 Guangdong 25 Anqing 10</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 48 Inland 100 Changsha 30 Sichuan 150</p>
<h3 id="e243">Actual Sales Weak, Foreign Cotton Low, Standard Cotton Trends Down <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market fell sharply due to the weakness of American cotton and the particularly soft trend of Indian cotton. The market's current cotton mill demand was stagnant, leading to discouragement, scattered liquidations, and large companies also refraining from action. Although the weather for new cotton was dry, buyers released their holdings due to the blandness of foreign cotton, and market prices trended downstream.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Down 6-8 Jiao The pre-market opening price of standard cotton was affected by the softening of foreign cotton. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and the exchange rate was extended, and short positions were active. Each had an average decline of 2-3 jiao. However, new cotton was slightly higher due to the impact of hot weather. When the market was auctioned to the second and third sessions, the yarn market fell again, and the cotton market was still soft. As a result, each month fell by 3-4 jiao to 5-6 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that a lot of Indian cotton was being sold, and the market atmosphere was even more frustrated, and each month fell by another 1.5 jiao to 2.5 jiao-3 jiao. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 103,400 dan. It was found that Chunji sold 3,000 dan, Zhenda 1,200 dan, Dafu 5,000 dan, Tongji 3,000 dan, Hengyi 3,200 dan, Huikang 7,100 dan, Shenji 3,600 dan, Renfeng 1,300 dan, Fuyuan 1,600 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,200 dan, Yuanda bought 5,600 dan, Suilong 1,700 dan, Mingde 1,400 dan, Shenchang 6,100 dan, Dachang 3,300 dan, Ruiyuan 5,600 dan, and Changhe 5,000 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially firmed due to poor weather, but later weakened due to good cotton harvest conditions and bull liquidations. As a result, spot goods fell by 10 basis points, and futures fell by 7-11 basis points. British cotton futures fell by 12 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to bull liquidations, but later firmed due to buying by speculators and European exporters. As a result, Pinggaoer remained unchanged, Omlara rose by half a rupee, and Bai Luoxi rose by 3.5 jiao. The original telegram is listed on the left (telegram of the 27th):</p>

<p>After the opening of the flour market this morning, the prices of each month showed a sharp and frantic trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago, was good by 4 cents to 1 jiao, and Canada was less than 48 cents. However, recently, people in the market have paid less attention to foreign situations. The biggest focus at present is the drought in various places, the damage to the fields, and the influence on rice prices. As a result, attention has turned to the crazy purchase of flour and wheat, and the opening of traffic in North China is considered to be the way to restore the three eastern provinces. Whether the facts will be like this in the future has not been considered during the fever. Therefore, after the opening price, the near and far months have risen one after another. For example, November jumped wildly to 2 yuan 3 jiao, which is rarely justified when wheat is harvested. By the afternoon opening, the frenzy was still seen, but with extreme increases, some of the profitable speculative bulls took advantage of the trend to return to the market. It was rumored that it rained in North China, Wuxi rice returned to 2 jiao, paddy returned to 2 jiao, and wheat was 5 cents less, so people's hearts have turned weak. The repeated high prices will lead to the arrival of foreign flour wheat in China, which is possible as in the past two or three years. As a result, this month and July are still up 3 cents, August to October are each good by 2 cents and 7.5 li, and November is good by 1 cent and 7.5 li.</p>
<p>Another report Yesterday, the red sun was still in the sky, and off-market speculation was still high. However, after this surge, it is a huge obstacle for the flour in this port to be transported to the eastern provinces. It is heard that Australian flour can be ordered for 2 yuan and 8 jiao, and there is no problem without adding foreign flour tax to the eastern provinces. Although South China has tariff protection, the way of suicide is the same now and in the past. Therefore, although the drought has a reason to raise prices, it is also necessary to understand the domestic and foreign situation. However, at present, during the speculative frenzy, there is no way to talk about accurate speculation.</p>
<h3 id="e248">The Futures Wheat Market is also Consistently Firm <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month showed a consistent trend of firmness. Although the price of foreign wheat fluctuated very little, the market was paying attention to the rising prices in the flour market. Although this year's wheat has had bumper harvests everywhere, the rural goods cannot be concentrated in the metropolis due to the drought, so the prosperous year is causing famine, attracting off-market large-scale speculation. After the opening price in the morning, each month rose by 5, 6, or 7 cents, but then there was consolidation. The transaction was still strong in the afternoon, but the price has changed little. Although the layman's mind is good, some local experts have been selling, so the market lacks the power to be firm. The current wheat market has shown a steady trend. The supply is still surging, the factory is not greedy, the open and bright wheat is 3 yuan 1 jiao 3 cents, the Bengbu Linhuai Pass wheat is 3 yuan 1 jiao 3 cents, the second is 1 jiao, the Jiangjiazhen wheat is 3 yuan 1 jiao, the Yangzhou wheat is 3 yuan and 3 cents, the Pukou wheat is 3 yuan 9 jiao 2 cents, the second is 8 jiao 8 cents, the Wuhu wheat is 2 yuan 9 jiao, the second is 8 jiao 8 cents, the Baoying wheat is 3 yuan, the Hefei wheat is 2 yuan 9 jiao 6 cents, the Nanjing wheat is 2 yuan 9 jiao 3 cents, the second is 8 jiao 8 cents, the Wuxi wheat is 3 yuan 6 cents, the Changzhou wheat is 3 yuan 3 cents, and the Zhenjiang wheat is 2 yuan 9 jiao 7 cents. The Luhe wheat is 2 yuan 9 jiao 4 cents. Fuxin will take 12,000 bags, and Fufeng will take 8,000 bags.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 suppliers arrived from various gangs, with about 4,500 shi of goods, of which there was more late rice, and one-third was thick japonica. Therefore, although the Northern Gang continued to handle more than 2,000 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xilian goods, the customer's eating problem was ultimately difficult to relax, and the market situation suddenly became bleak due to the stalemate between the two dynasties. As for the thick japonica of various gangs, the store's stomach was limited, but relying on the drought, people gradually became optimistic, and Chang Gang's Su Tong Nangang goods are now average, and Du Yangjian and Yinbianyuan have no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 16 or 17 suppliers arrived from various roads downstream. The customer side of the white japonica market in the morning was still tight, but there were few outlets, resulting in the early market price of high goods adding nearly jiao, and the noon market was steady. The outlets for Baiyuan and Kejian were sluggish, and the price was upright. There were few thin rice goods, and the price rose again.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Silk and Tea: Black, Green, and Red Tea All Trending Down <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and French firms in this port's foreign firm tea market were not lonely in their entry to the Qi Men and Lianghu black tea and the Ping Shui green tea, but due to the continued rise in the shilling exchange rate, the recognized price was still harsh. The whole market traded more than 3,700 boxes of black and green tea from various roads. The market price of the best quality core-drawing Zhenmei fell by 5 or 6 yuan, and the rest also fell by 1 or 2 yuan to 3 or 4 yuan. Although this situation has no major relationship with sales, judging from the current trend, it is still feared that there will be only rises and no falls.</p>

<h3 id="e251">It is Said <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>It is said that a good chess move is equivalent to several moves. A gentleman of the country does not do one-sided transactions. The effect should be unexpected, and the benefit lies in many aspects. For example, when buying something for one yuan, you can also eat a free box of ice cream, or get an aviation lottery ticket, with the hope of winning 500,000 yuan, which is a pleasure.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful way of doing many things at once. A shrew scolding in the street points at A, scolds B, is scolded by C, and makes D suffer, while also expressing herself. This kind of Tao is broad and profound. No wonder the autumn man of the past had the "art of scolding people", a great masterpiece.</p>
<p>The recent "scientific spiritual divination" is a great invention and a brilliant move. Are you superstitious about Western science? Please see the scientific spiritual divination. If you despise spiritual divination, then you must also disbelieve science; it increases the momentum of spiritual divination, and those who promote new culture will be unlucky, but poisonous domestic goods! Moreover, it will soon spread throughout China, and may even last for a long time. That power is far more powerful than a knife or a pen.</p>
<p>Doesn't society ridicule certain people as "eight-sided darlings"? Take a look at the social celebrities, entertaining guests, and being considerate in every aspect, and you can get a glimpse or two. But don't misunderstand that they are busy talking with eight tongues, but rather saying a word that makes eight people feel personally close and satisfied. There is a kind of ball game in the West where one ball knocks down eight or nine pins, which can describe this skill.</p>
<p>But why are there so few successful people of the "eight-sided darling" type? Because it is neither a Tao, nor are there many purposes, so the power is dispersed. If the power is divided, the result is weak. To prevent attacks from all sides, the result is only to be smooth and become a crystal ball. On the other hand, the sharp edges cannot be covered everywhere, and it ends in failure. On the contrary, perseverance, breaking the complex with the simple, is easy to achieve results. What's more, the way of man is endless, doesn't even a national chess player lose sometimes?</p>
<h3 id="e252">I Also Discuss the Controversy of Literary Language and Vernacular <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Qi</p>
<p>Since Mr. Wang Maozu and Mr. Wu Renyin started the controversy between literary language and vernacular, it has aroused the attention of the general public to a problem that was not originally a problem; especially the colleagues in the Shanghai literary circle, such as Mr. Chen Wangdao, Chen Zizhan, Cao Juren, Le Sibing, and Hu Yuzhi, have all published their opinions in this journal; it is said that there are still many people preparing manuscripts. However, most of the opinions they have published are based on the standpoint of the entire society, discussing how to popularize and make the tool of language universal, so that the general public, regardless of the wise, the mediocre, and the foolish, can understand and exchange opinions. Therefore, some of them have proposed creating a "mass language." Because I have been entrusted by them, they want me to participate with some opinions: now I will tentatively narrow the scope, stand solely on the position of education, and bring up the question of whether the first-grade Chinese textbook in elementary schools, especially in elementary schools, should use literary language or vernacular for discussion.</p>
<p>Of course, on Mr. Wang's side, he did not advocate that the first grade of elementary school must adopt literary language and should not adopt vernacular. He only advocated that school education should increase with the grade, from vernacular to both vernacular and literary language, and can completely adopt literary language in the university era. In this way, then, in the first grade of elementary school, whether it is Mr. Wang, Mr. Wu, or the gentlemen of the Shanghai literary world, they all unanimously advocate the adoption of vernacular, so there is no need for any controversy. The current problem lies only in how the first-grade Chinese textbook in elementary schools should be compiled. Specifically, what kind of vernacular should it adopt to be correct? Because Mr. Hu Yuzhi pointed out that there are several types of vernacular: such as the vernacular after the May Fourth Movement, the quotations style, the Saturday School, and the Zhang Henshui School, and even the "mass language" proposed by Mr. Chen Zizhan, etc. Therefore, the content of the first-grade Chinese textbook in elementary schools in the future has become a problem as to what vernacular should be used. However, I personally do not want to or am not able to express any opinions on this issue at the moment. What I want to say is that I have to temporarily borrow the first volume of the Japanese elementary school Chinese textbook to examine it and see how the Japanese side views this issue, and then write out the results of my review for the reference of my country's educators.</p>
<p>The Japanese elementary school Chinese textbooks have always been used in combination with Kana and Kanji. Needless to say, the Chinese textbooks in the higher grades of elementary school are like this, even the Chinese textbooks in the first grade of elementary school, except for the very first one or two pages which are all in Kana, at least there is always one or two or three Kanji on the remaining pages, and the more pages there are, the more Kanji there are. As for now, please take the first volume of the elementary school Chinese textbook for ordinary courses issued by the Ministry of Education in December of Showa 7 to read, and it is not difficult to find that the Japanese textbooks have been greatly reformed. Specifically, although the first volume of the Japanese elementary school Chinese textbook still uses Kana and Kanji in combination, the number of Kanji characters is very few. There is not a single Kanji from the first page to the twenty-fifth page, all in Kana; then Kanji such as "一" (one), "二" (two), "三" (three), "四" (four) are inserted on the twenty-sixth page; from the twenty-seventh page to the thirtieth page are all in Kana again; Kanji such as "山" (mountain), "川" (river), "小" (small), "木" (tree), "五" (five) are inserted on the fortieth page; after that, there is only one Kanji "大" (big) on the forty-second page, and Kanji such as "六" (six), "七" (seven), "八" (eight), "九" (nine), "十" (ten) on the forty-fourth page; on the forty-fifth page, the numbers from "一" (one) to "十" (ten) are re-mentioned, and the Kanji on the forty-sixth and forty-seventh pages are only re-mentioning the Kanji that have been presented in the previous pages, such as "木" (tree), "山" (mountain). Later, the character "日" (sun) is presented on the forty-eighth page, the character "目" (eye) is presented on the fiftieth page, the character "中" (middle) is presented on the fifty-seventh page, the character "犬" (dog) is presented on the sixtieth page, the character "上" (up) is presented on the sixty-seventh page, and the character "人" (person) is presented on the seventy-second page. Apart from this, no other Kanji are presented. In total, there are seventy-eight pages in this mountain language textbook, and the number of Kanji characters occupied in it is only twenty-one characters such as "一, 二, 三, 四, 五, 六, 七, 八, 九, 十, 山, 川, 小, 木, 大, 日, 目, 中, 犬, 上, 人"; moreover, these twenty-one Kanji characters are only the concepts of numbers and very superficial concepts commonly used in daily life. From this, it can be seen that Japanese education is showing a tendency to reduce the number of Kanji characters as much as possible and emphasize the use of Kana more. It is also not known whether it will completely abandon Kanji and use Kana exclusively in the future. I dare to assert that this tendency of Japan is by no means due to the so-called education policy of "preserving national essence," but is based on the advocacy of new pedagogy.</p>
<p>If this proposition of Japan is correct, then the problem of Chinese textbooks in elementary schools in our country in the future is not a controversy between literary language and vernacular, but a question of whether to adopt "phonetic alphabet" or "phonetic symbols." This problem is also very huge, and I am not in a position to interfere. I will leave it to the educational administrative authorities to solve it themselves.</p>

<h3 id="e253">Random Notes from Mandalay <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>(1) In savage places, the words "fellow villager" still have considerable use; but in civilized cities, it is not so. For example, in Mandalay, the old capital of Burma, if you don't know the streets when you first go there, and you are hesitating to step into the midst of the traffic, and you ask a passing Chinese person for directions, then you will most likely hear the following Burmese reply:</p>
<p>"Nan Men Le Bu."</p>
<p>Meaning that I don't understand what you are saying, and then the person walks away with a straight face. Perhaps recognizing fellow villagers will more easily cause other troubles: such as asking for temporary help, entrusting to find work. Therefore, the words "fellow villager" are like rotten fruit in the summer, and cannot be sold at a good price here.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some Muslim Indian shopkeepers who know a little Chinese will learn the accent of the Yunnan people and greet you very kindly when you pass by their shops:</p>
<p>"Fellow villager, come in and take a look. If you don't buy, it's okay."</p>
<p>Comparing these two, one can glean another meaning from between people.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Burma, this country of coconuts and durians, I imagined as having a lot of romantic atmosphere during the trip; but once I arrived in Mandalay, on the ferry of the Irrawaddy River, looking at the wing of the green mountains on the east bank, in the misty rain, sending countless white pagodas, and the next morning, wearing a robe and looking out the window, seeing the monks in yellow robes, appearing in teams on the streets flooded with morning light, it gave people a sense of solemnity.</p>
<p>However, it doesn't make people feel gloomy, probably because they are not as rigid as we Chinese. For example, ordinary monks can eat fish and meat every day, and they also have freedom of love. Because, if they fall in love with a young female believer, or the daughter of a benefactor, they can take off their cassock and return to secular life. This has been the case with them since ancient times, and no one will criticize it.</p>
<p>Therefore, asceticism and indulgence do not conflict much in this country: just living in Mandalay for two or three days, you will deeply feel this atmosphere.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>"Tengyue Hall Chronicle" records the previous situation in Mandalay: "There is a brick city around, sixty-two li, with twelve gates, and wooden fences are set up outside, prohibiting rapid riding." When I saw it, the wooden fence was gone, and rapid riding was not prohibited, because there were already two shiny rails stretching into the city gate without any ceremony. Cannons were set up on the city tower, and foreign soldiers in yellow twill uniforms guarded the side all day long.</p>
<p>The style of the city wall is full of Chinese style, and it is said that it was built by Chinese craftsmen hired by the Burmese king in the past. The age seems not too long ago, and the characteristics that a general ancient city should have: incompleteness, plus the decoration of vines, none of those exist.</p>
<p>Outside the city, "the south is Chinatown, with many Chinese traders. The west is the foreign street, with a total of seventy-two streets, large and small." This was the situation in the eleventh year of Guangxu. If we trace back to before there was Chinatown and the foreign street, I think the situation of the market must be very interesting. "Diannan Magazine" records that under the Burmese king "there are four great wan, followed by wan tao, and outside of that there are seven wan." "Each wan has no salary, and they are ordered to do business, to take profit as official capital." From this point of view, being an official and being a boss have become inseparable things, then the government and the store are either merged into one, or they are next to each other.</p>

<p>'Now you are mine, Anna丨丨 all of you丨丨 all of you丨This beautiful brunette hair, red and sweet cherry lips, passionate and dark eyes, proud and swan-like neck丨丨, all belong to me.'</p>
<p>'Yes丨丨 Yes丨丨 I belong to you, Karl!'</p>
<p>They were happy丨丨 not for long. But sensual love is a kind of intoxication, and when they woke up from this intoxication and recovered their senses, they couldn't help but shout:</p>
<p>'What will we live on? We have no money! We have nothing to eat.'</p>
<p>Before they could finish speaking, someone was knocking at the door. Then an unknown person walked in.</p>
<p>'May I have the honor of saying a few words to Mr. Karl?'</p>
<p>Karl heard this, confused and panicked, because he felt that he had met that person before.</p>
<p>'You don't answer,' the unknown person continued, 'but the panic in your words has already proved that you are the person I want to visit. I ask you to sign this small piece of paper. I will come to visit you again a year from today. Don't forget丨丨 exactly one year. Goodbye.'</p>
<p>This mysterious man left. But at this time, it is difficult to say which was stronger, the panic or the joy of this couple. Because the piece of paper that the unknown person gave him was a check for an amount sufficient to provide them with a year of luxurious living. According to the way it was written, payable on sight, the money could be paid to them immediately.</p>
<p>'This is incomprehensible,' Mrs. Anna said, looking at the check.</p>
<p>'This is really inexplicable.' Karl agreed. 'Gold is falling to us, just like heavenly dew.'</p>
<p>Now they can live a very happy life. They will not be subjected to material oppression. Now they think that the merchant certainly does not know them. If he did, why didn't he tell Andro?</p>
<p>'At the end of the year,' Karl said, 'this unknown person will come again, and we will have more money. Didn't he say that?'</p>

<p>— Stupid</p>
<p>Before I wrote this rubbish, I have a few statements to make. I fundamentally do not understand how to make the people's language, and I don't even understand what kind of writing the people's language is. Because I see that the few writers who advocate the people's language are just scolding literary Chinese and vernacular Chinese in a roundabout way, and as a result, they have not announced how to make the people's language and how to make it easy to popularize. It is really "a tall monk of two meters, unable to touch his head." And after carefully reading the writings of the writers who advocate the people's language, I can't smell the flavor of the people's language at all. It is still the tone of the Lan Qing Mandarin. It can be seen everywhere, so I fundamentally do not understand what the people's language is all about, so I want to ask for advice.</p>
<p>If you gentlemen are willing to give sincere advice with an attitude of consultation, I will be very welcome. If you come and scold me in a roundabout way, "old stubborn," "reversing the car," "anti-era," "outdated," and other titles will be conferred on me all at once, I can only cover my mouth and remain silent, letting you scold me severely. I will never dare to hum or open my mouth again. This is a lesson I have learned from decades of experience.</p>
<p>Speaking of writing, the old antiques of the past, which were conceived in the womb, should not be taken out again. Let's talk about the most recent writing first. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the writing commonly used in our country can be divided into about four types.</p>
<p>One type is the old-fashioned literary Chinese.</p>
<p>One type is newspaper-style writing.</p>
<p>One type is translation-style writing (or it can be called Europeanized writing).</p>
<p>One type is the commonly called vernacular Chinese (or spoken language).</p>
<p>I am bringing these out, which seems to have nothing to do with this issue, but it can be understood that the changes in writing have a sense of the times and a sense of evolution. Among these four types of writing, the old-fashioned literary Chinese is not suitable for use and is aristocratic, so let's put it aside for now. Secondly, let's talk about newspaper-style writing. This type of writing has both vernacular and literary Chinese. If you add a few more "的" (de) or "呢" (ne) characters, it can be said to be vernacular Chinese. If you refine and polish it a little more, it can also be said to be literary Chinese. Next, let's talk about translation-style writing. Because the writing translated by several Western scholars and degree holders such as Yan Youling and Lin Qinnan was too obscure and difficult to understand, they changed their style and used vernacular to translate. Because the Chinese and Western languages are ultimately different in sentence structure (foreign languages put the main words in front and the subsidiary words behind, while Chinese puts the subsidiary words in front and the main words behind. One is deductive, and one is inductive. This can be seen on Chinese and Western envelopes). The translated writing is often more than a chopstick long, and there are two or three or more "的" (de) characters in it. This is called translation-style writing. And then there is the vernacular Chinese advocated by several writers after the New Culture Movement.</p>
<p>Among these four types of writing, the old-fashioned literary Chinese is rarely used except in official documents and birthday prefaces. Because the translation-style writing is not understood by readers, the sentences have also gradually shortened. Only newspaper writing</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>and vernacular Chinese are now very powerful and unimpeded. However, some people have also advocated that newspaper writing should be changed to vernacular, but because of various obstacles and the fact that vernacular Chinese occupies too much space, it has not been implemented. Perhaps this is the shortcoming of vernacular Chinese. As for vernacular writing, it has not been promoted for long, and there are still some people who come out to oppose it. From this point of view, in terms of vernacular Chinese itself, it has not yet reached a stable stage, and it has not yet reached a perfect stage. Now some people are advocating the people's language. In fact, the reason why the current vernacular Chinese cannot be completely unimpeded and there are still people who stand up to oppose and destroy it may also be because the vernacular Chinese has not yet reached a perfect state. We should first study and sort out the vernacular Chinese. If it really cannot be improved, then we can advocate other types of writing. If we do not study or research because the vernacular Chinese still has difficult places, and we overthrow and destroy it, and then advocate a kind of people's language, I think this kind of progress is too rapid, isn't it? The occurrence and success of any event always has a sense of the times and a sense of evolution. It is impossible to cross to the thirty-third heaven in one step.</p>
<p>I will clarify such an evolution first, and then talk about the people's language. I generally observe that the writers who advocate the people's language mostly advocate adopting slang, and extremely common slang. This meaning is indeed very good. I think it will definitely be a bit difficult to implement, because the dialects in various places are mostly different. If the people of Jiangsu think it is popular, but people elsewhere may not understand it. For example, the Ningbo people's "阿拉" (ala) and the Suzhou people's "裏篤" (li du), people who often live in Shanghai think it is popular, but if people in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou hear it, they still don't understand it.</p>
<p>In fact, slang and literary Chinese all depend on whether they can be used universally or not. If slang is used to, it can become literary Chinese. If literary Chinese is used to, it can become slang. It all depends on getting used to it. If it is used for a long time, it will naturally become common. Therefore, at the beginning of advocating the people's language, we cannot immediately turn all literary Chinese into slang. In the beginning, we can only use both literary Chinese and slang. To put it bluntly, we should use some literary Chinese and some vernacular. Over time, it may be possible to turn it completely into slang. There is no reason to reach the goal in one step.</p>
<p>I see that some writers, as soon as they see someone occasionally use a literary Chinese word, say that he is not thorough enough. This is too excessive. For example, if a case of patricide occurs in Hubei Province, they say that all the people in Hubei Province are patricides. If a case of robbery occurs in Anhui Province, they say that all the people in Anhui Province are robbers. Isn't this a joke? In fact, vernacular Chinese only has three conditions, which are the most important: can be written, can be spoken, and can be understood. In the past, during the Qing Dynasty, some people also advocated unifying the national language. What method should be used to unify this national language? Only by selecting a literary Chinese as the standard language. Therefore, at that time, there was a great debate in the Executive Yuan. Some advocated using Henan language, because Luoyang is in the center of China, so the Central Plains language should be adopted as the standard. Some advocated using Beijing language, because Beijing is the capital, so the Beijing language should be adopted as the standard. As a result of the debate between the two sides, the victory naturally belonged to the latter (because my brain is very bad, there may be errors in time, but there is always such a fact). Unified to the present, although there are still few people who can speak real Mandarin, there are many who can speak and understand Lan Qing Mandarin. I think that if the writers who advocate the people's language also take being able to write, hear, and speak as conditions, no matter how Lan Qing it is, as long as people can understand it, write it, and speak it, that's it. Why bother to seek other methods? If there are still some inappropriate places in the current vernacular Chinese, it is more convenient to improve the vernacular Chinese first. I don't know what the writers who advocate the people's language think of my opinion.</p>

<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>丨Women's World No. 19丨</p>
<p>Everyone is bound to have dreams. Living a hard life can also be said to be looking forward to and pursuing future dreams; if human beings have no dreams, they may die from it.</p>
<p>Dreams are originally real and free in one's own mind; but when they are written on white paper, there will inevitably be some hypocrisy and affectation; the reason is that speaking when one is conscious, one cannot but take into account all aspects of the human world. In "My Ideal Future Life Special Issue", these female authors who tell their dreams, to what extent their hypocrisy and affectation are, cannot be deduced now, so let's assume that they are completely true.</p>
<p>These eleven young women who have received higher education, some are looking forward to finding an ideal lover and living the life of a virtuous wife and loving mother; some are longing for the beauty of nature and want to live a leisurely life in a secluded village with beautiful mountains and clear waters; some are seeking a suitable job to avoid relying on others for support and enduring their restraints; some feel that the current situation in China is so chaotic and the status of women in society is so low, and want to dedicate themselves to the country and fight for themselves. Although the dreams they talk about are so different; but in the final analysis, most of them are still fascinated by the personal "enjoyable, poetic life."</p>
<p>In China, women who have received higher education can also be said to be the most advanced and most awakened. For thousands of years, they have been tightly bound by the old morality and old etiquette, and have been like lambs succumbing to the authority of their husbands. In recent decades, due to the collapse of the old system and the struggle of many awakened people, a part has escaped from the old shackles; but as soon as they get rid of the old restraints, the new professional chains are tightly hanging on their necks. Isn't the matter of selling one's appearance everywhere? Isn't the cry of "vase" everywhere to be heard? Tens of thousands of poor women are eager for these advanced and awakened same-sex people to support and rescue them, but these advanced and awakened people are single-mindedly ignoring them and fascinated by pink dreams, which is not to make people sigh!</p>
<p>After reading this special issue, a terrible shadow appeared in my mind about the future of the women's movement; my only hope is that the dreams said are completely false and pretentious!</p>

<h3 id="e260">The Heroic Collective Suicide of Nine Women <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Naifu</p>
<p>The Shen Bao's special telegram on the 24th said: "Seven sisters-in-law and aunts from the same Pan surname family outside the North Gate of Hui'an, Fujian, and two from the Chen surname, nine women formed an alliance and committed suicide. On the 21st night, they tied each other into a formation and jumped into the water, all died. The women are aged thirteen to nineteen, married or unmarried, except for the youngest one, most of them were dissatisfied with their marriages and tired of the world." After reading this news, we can't help but feel terrified and really feel "What world is this?" "Is it real or a dream?"</p>
<p>But as long as we have a little memory and a little reason, we can unhesitatingly determine that this is completely true, not a "dream" at all. This is a phenomenon that is bound to occur in the current Chinese society, and there is no need to be surprised!</p>
<p>The more social systems move towards an inevitable decline, the more cruel they become. Because the other side of the decline of the old society is the rise of the new society. The more rapid the process of decline, the more intense the confrontation between the old and the new will be. When it reaches a certain point, the old will be discarded and the new will be produced at the same time.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, China's feudal patriarchal system should be in decline now. But the facts tell us that its cruelty is getting worse day by day. The suicide of Mrs. Qin Lizhai and her children and the whole family earlier this month had already exposed the evils of this outdated system to the world. This collective suicide of nine women especially shows a heroic and tragic social phenomenon. They are major phenomena with historical significance; not accidental events worthy of pity; not their cowardly and humble acts; but a heroic and tragic act!</p>
<p>On the same day, the Shen Bao also published a news item about a female student from Hangzhou Girls' High School who also committed suicide due to marriage problems, which further proves that this type of phenomenon is common everywhere in China. What's more, in the closed areas of the interior, which are also the places where the patriarchal system is most powerful, I don't know how many similar events are happening in various ways, and are ultimately covered up by the strong forces of ghosts and gods and various means, and cannot be seen in the newspapers and attract everyone's attention.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I cannot but loudly appeal to my enlightened Chinese women: The promotion of history depends entirely on human power. Women account for half of humanity, and naturally bear half of the mission for the future of mankind. Moreover, all the poisons that the old society has given to women are even worse than those given to men. According to the principle that the greater the oppression, the stronger the resistance, the resistance of women should be stronger than that of men! If the oppression is too heavy, it is better to commit suicide happily than to endure suffering and steal life. But suicide must have some meaning. If you die in vain, what is the meaning of death?</p>
<h3 id="e261">Third-Class Ward <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>In a simple third-class ward, six beds are arranged lengthwise and crosswise. In front of each bed, there is a small square table, on which rests a teapot and a spittoon. The air inside is very silent, except for the coughing and moaning of a few patients, there is almost no sign of life!</p>
<p>When I was sent to the ×× Hospital, my nerves were unusually disordered, so I knew nothing; after being put to sleep on a small white-painted iron bed against the wall, a smell of foul medicine rushed to my brain. At that moment, I regained my lost senses.</p>
<p>It was nighttime. I turned over in bed, opened my eyes, and looked around, and everything surprised me. The faces in the room were all unfamiliar, and I couldn't recognize any of them at all. My Mei was missing, and I couldn't find my mother and brother either. I wanted to ask the person sleeping in the other bed, but I didn't dare. So, the words I wanted to say several times were finally swallowed back into my stomach, and my heart was indeed a little frustrated!</p>
<p>In the center of the room, the ten-candlepower electric light emitted its dim light, which was so bleak that it had no strength at all. It was just like the patients in bed.</p>
<p>In the corridor outside the door, clear, rhythmic footsteps came from outside in bursts. Then, the door opened, and a young woman in plain clothes walked in, holding a tray. Smiling, she approached the bed and placed the tray on the small square table. First, she took my pulse and measured my temperature. Then, she took the pulse and measured the temperature of everyone else in the same way.</p>
<p>"How are your bowel movements? Can you sleep?" Everyone was asked this question as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Testing stool, testing urine, testing blood, testing sputum. These are the initial procedures that every patient must undergo when they arrive at the hospital.</p>
<p>Old Su and Old Li have been living here for more than half a year. They used to live in the second-class ward, but later they moved to this third-class ward because of economic reasons.</p>
<p>According to them: they used to contact the night nurses every night, secretly running out to watch movies, go to hotels and gamble. In fact, their illnesses had long been cured, but because they didn't cherish their bodies, they are now worse, and the problems are more serious than before!</p>
<p>They can't be so free now. This is because the treatment in the third-class ward is certainly not as good as in the first and second classes. Now, after they have eaten dinner, they are taken to the chapel to listen to a sermon about Jesus; when they can't sleep after returning, they open their throats and tell stories from "Shan Hai Jing," "Jianghu Qi Xia Zhuan," "Jin Gu Qi Guan," etc. These are their best materials. However, they have to keep their voices especially low, because if it's too loud, it will affect other people's sleep and they will be interfered with by the nurses. But I don't feel too lonely because of this.</p>
<p>During the daytime, 9 a.m. to 12 noon is the best time to rest. Temperature is measured three times a day, pulse is taken three times, and medicine is taken three times. All life is mechanized. After lunch, one must take a bath and wipe the body. After these things are done, one prepares to stretch one's neck and hope that relatives, friends, and family will come to visit.</p>
<p>Every visiting hour, the elevator is crowded with people visiting patients. Especially me, whenever someone comes to visit me, I always reluctantly ask them to sit for a while longer. When they leave, I stare blankly at the door and feel sad for a while!</p>
<p>This situation is like a prisoner in jail hoping that acquaintances will come to visit him.</p>
<p>I only stayed in the ×× Hospital for more than a month; however, it almost destroyed my entire soul and burned my active life to death. Although the smiles and consolation of the young women in plain clothes are worth cherishing, they cannot eliminate my frustration and cannot hide my sadness! So, I finally couldn't wait to get well and made an excuse to leave the third-class ward and go to the countryside to recuperate.</p>
<p>The countryside has a quiet environment and fresh air, which is most suitable for patients to recuperate. Moreover, I am a "wild child" who is active by nature and doesn't like to be quiet. Being locked up in that innocent prison like in a hospital, unable to step out of the ward! It was simply suffocating me!</p>
<p>However, when I left the lovely young women in plain clothes and stepped onto the Shanghai-Hangzhou train, I still looked back at the roof of the hospital and shouted in a low voice: "Farewell! My lovely young women in plain clothes!"</p>
<h3 id="e262">### Good-for-Nothing Son <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Han Bai</p>
<p>Father's dim and old face has become increasingly gloomy lately!</p>
<p>The hardworking and simple father gives all the harvest, the remaining wealth, accumulated and saved from his labor of a drop of blood and a drop of sweat, to his son to send him to a commercial university.</p>
<p>He丨丨the father endures all the pain, all the insults and ridicule. In the severe winter, people wear brand new fur coats, but he still wears a cotton robe made of coarse cloth; in the hot summer, people wear soft and light summer clothes, but he still wears a heavy cloth garment. However, on the outside, he always looks so happy and joyful, because all his happiness, hope, and comfort are entrusted to his son's future. Zheng Daihe's works</p>
<p>He hopes that after his son finishes his studies, he can become a high official, or at least make a lot of money, to compensate for the price he paid before, to breathe a breath of free air, and to show off his power in front of people. After all, his past endurance has been rewarded.</p>
<p>But his son cannot repay his ardent wishes. His son has been away from the diploma exchange university for almost two years, and he is still the same son as before, except that his face is a little older and his beard is a little thicker. Wandering and drifting in the bustling city, he is rejected outside the iron circle of the current society. He has not learned the art of being an official, the skill of making money; nor does he have powerful relatives or money to curry favor. In this way, he can never have official luck in the current society, no matter how his father boasts that his son's fate is noble, the result is only to disappoint him!</p>
<p>Because his son is an extraordinary son (of course, in his father's opinion, a good-for-nothing son), a son with reason. How could he not know how eagerly his father hoped that he could bring glory to his ancestors; how could he not know how his father had struggled to get the money to provide for him to study. Perhaps he understood these issues even better than his father. He knew very well that money, which is used as a measure for exchanging goods, can enslave and trample on everyone, but he never wanted to be a prisoner of money. On the contrary, he wanted to destroy the money that can enslave people. He forgot all tiredness and lived his hard life rationally and painfully. He believes that the family is a local problem, and the dregs of individualism should be eliminated from the family first.</p>
<p>And his father? He has been left far behind by the wheels of the times! The poison he has received from feudal society is too deep! If the consciousness of all mankind were the same as his father's, then the structure of the current society would be as stable as Mount Tai, and the people in the palaces and dance halls could always tranquilly dream sweet dreams and enjoy their unique honor.</p>
<p>Living in these two extremely opposite worlds, naturally his father can only sigh, roar, and scold his son as a good-for-nothing son with disappointed eyes!</p>

<h3 id="e263">### No Trace <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw an advertisement in the "Shishi Xinbao" for a free sample of the "Golden Arrow" pen nib, saying that it was exquisite and beautiful, and no pen nib could match it. It would never break the paper, whether writing Chinese or Western characters. There was also a sample coupon printed in the newspaper, which said: "Cut out the coupon, write the sender's address and name, and send it to Post Office Box 1567 with a ten-cent sample coupon. After receiving it, we will send it immediately." But after several days, there was no trace, not a single message. Recently, I wrote him another letter, asking him if he had received it, but there has been no information so far. The ten-cent postage stamp is a trivial matter, but I don't understand what kind of trick they are playing. Please help me solve this problem? With kind regards,</p>
<p>Sincerely, Hu Kan</p>
<p>Answer: I don't know what the content of the question you asked is. Does this advertisement for a free sample have a brand name or company address printed on it in the newspaper? If not, it is a bit suspicious. According to my guess, the reason why you sent the sample coupon and there was no trace is probably due to three reasons. First, the letter was not delivered. Second, the store is slow to handle things and has not yet sent the sample. Third, it is a scam to defraud money. Since you remember the address so clearly, it is unlikely that it was not delivered by the post office. Moreover, it has been many days since you sent it. No matter how slow the handling is, there should always be a reply. Therefore, it is likely that you have been deceived in sending the postage stamp to ask for the pen nib this time. Nowadays, many of these advertisements that attract readers to buy by saying "attach a few cents of postage, and we will send it immediately" are scams. Therefore, we should not completely trust formal advertisements that do not publish the company's numbers and addresses, but only say to send letters to a certain mailbox. There is no such thing as a free lunch in the world. Being greedy for small gains is the easiest way to be fooled. Editor</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Many years passed from then on. When this chastity widow died in her eighty-sixth year, she told her son in her will:</p>
<p>"∶∶∶Go and ask Uncle Fengxiang to write my epitaph. Kneel in front of him and ask him to include the matter of the candle sticks.∶∶∶"</p>
<p>In this way, Madam Shi's secret was revealed from Grandfather Fengxiang's mouth, and this was how she became a chastity widow. As for building the stone archway and requesting the imperial decree, that upright family uncle spent a lot of effort. At that time, he had already served as the chief examiner once. Counting it, it has been forty years since then. However, that chief examiner has been dead for many years, leaving only his son who made a fortune and lives ten miles away from the village. This is something everyone knows.</p>
<p>I don't know when it started, but hot winds have risen in the gaps between the leaves. When a black cloud floats past the sun, a shadow immediately follows and crawls across the ground, but it disappears in a moment, until the second cloud floats past.</p>
<p>When Shi Min woke up, his father was returning from the city. He had gone to the city this morning, and according to his usual habit, he would not be home until after the sun went down. But he came back especially early, which inevitably made his mother express surprise and ask:</p>
<p>"Why are you back so early today? It's not dark yet."</p>
<p>"What's so strange about that?" the father said frankly. "Of course I'll come back early if there's nothing to do. ∶∶∶Let me tell you, today I met someone from the provincial capital in the county who said that Huang Xing is agitating for revolution again, and I'm afraid there will be changes in the overall situation in China. But the newspaper didn't report it."</p>
<p>"Oh? Then how did that person know?" the mother said, watching her father take off his long gown.</p>
<p>"If there really is such a thing," the father said with concern as he unbuttoned his short shirt, "then the fate of the Manchus is about to end. From the time Emperor Shunzhi entered the pass to now, it has been more than three hundred years. But from Emperor Guangxu to now, two generations in a row cannot pass on the legitimate line. It was already strange that Tongzhi passed the throne to his younger brother Guangxu, and now Xuantong wants to inherit from two ancestors with one word. Then the palace maids and concubines cannot even give birth to a son. Isn't this Heaven ending their line?"</p>
