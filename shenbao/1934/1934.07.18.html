<h3 id="c24">論東歐互助公約恒　丨由洛卡諾公約觀察此約之前途丨 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>自英法恊調後。國際視線羣集於東歐互助公約之訂立惟此約之内容何若尙未披露英意雖有贊同之說。能否成功。亦尙有待於當事國之折衝故在今日而預加推測。未必皆中。然英法各國。旣名此約爲東歐洛卡諾則其性質。當與洛卡諾原約有多少雷同之處。吾人固不難由原約而窺見其一斑也。</p>
<p>所謂洛卡諾條約者。係指一九二五年十月十六日英法意比波捷德七國所簽訂之條約。其内容在保證凡爾賽和約所規定之德比德法疆界現狀。及其非武裝區域。復由德比德法相約不以兵戎相見。如有故意破壞萊因地帶</p>
<p>之非武裝區域者。則施以國聯會章第十六條之制裁。同日。法國與蘭捷克又各簽訂特殊互助公約。其大意云。假若今日波法（捷法）二國與德匣所訂之維持和平辦法。不被遵守或竟受武力之侵害時。兩軥彼此立卽相助。如國聯不能裁制破約行爲。則二國可以自由行動統觀二約之性質實於法比波捷大有裨益世人目之爲法國外交大勝利良有以也。</p>
<p>洛卡諾公約之要點。旣如上述。吾人欲預測東歐洛卡諾之性質。或可以此爲參考。按東歐互助公約之醞釀。迄今已有數月。直接主張者。雖爲俄法。間接促成者。實爲希脫拉。希氏自上台後。對外態度。異常强硬。其最使法國痛心蘇俄惶懼者。莫若今春成立之德波十年不侵條約。蓋此一條約成立後。法波之攻守同盟。無形瓦解。德若攻法。法卽少一助力。此法國之所以不得不拉攏蘇</p>
<p>俄以爲外援也。至於蘇俄。旣受東方日本之威脅。自不能不謀西方疆界之安全。數月以來。國際間常有一種傳說。謂德波除不侵條約外。尙有恊力攻俄之密約。一俟日俄戰端爆發。卽行東侵。事定之後。波取俄之烏克蘭。德則收回波蘭之走廊。及立陶宛之一部。此雖雖傳說。不足輕信。然在俄人則不能不防。本年三月間。蘇俄向德提議。會同波蘭。保障波羅的海諸國之中立。其意顯在探視</p>
<p>德國眞意。孰知竟遭白眼。廢然而止。至是德人對俄之仇視心理。又多一重暴露。蘇俄遂决定親法以自保。而東歐互助公約之訂立。亦遂爲二國共同之目標。法俄之交。原因在此。卽今次英法之恊調。亦何嘗不受希氏政策之影嚮。此留心國際情勢者所共知也。</p>
<p>吾人參照洛卡諾公約之成例。乃知東歐互助公約之性質。當亦不外爲維持現有疆界之條約而已。洛卡諾所保障者。爲德法。德比。德波。德捷間之疆界。而棗歐公約所保障者。當爲德俄。波俄。及德國與波羅的海諸國間之疆界等現狀。苟能擴而大之。則可包括小恊約巴爾幹以及奥匈意諸國。亦未可料。</p>
<p>將來享受此約之特殊利益者。自爲法俄。據十四日羅馬云。此約之草案規定。法受德襲擊時蘇俄担保助法反之蘇俄受德襲擊時。則法國担保助俄。蓋不啻一法俄之攻守同盟也。</p>
<p>預料此約而成。歐局可保小康。設地中海之區域公約。亦能如願成立。則歐局或可大定。至訂結此約之是非曲直。事不屬我。可不具論。唯其利害影響。不</p>
<p>僅及於歐洲。抑且有關遠東。則不容忽視。蓋九一八後。日人所以敢於目空一切。以國際多事耳。苟歐局而能大定。則英法諸國必將增加其注意力於遠東。以與日本相周旋。惟就現勢而論。各國縱能以一時之利害相結合。總不免於</p>
<p>同床異夢。東歐互助公助之前途。阻礙尙多。殊未許遽抱樂觀也。</p>

<p>中央社云、邇來報載、本市米商因鑒於天氣亢旱成災、擬向外商訂購洋米五十萬石、以資抑平米價、茲據本市荳米業公會主席顧馨一氏、向中央社記者、發表談話如下、</p>
<h3 id="c130">今年漲風罕有 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>據顧氏首稱、年來米價狂跌、以致農村經濟發生恐慌、但近以天氣亢旱、一</p>
<p>般人心、深恐釀成巨災、米價於是高漲、在此靑黄不接之時、雖係年有之事、但若今年漲風之如是迅速、亦爲罕有、爲民食着想、殊爲不利、而農民所受影響、亦非淺鮮、故本市米商、有擬進購洋米之議、以抑平米價、</p>
<h3 id="c131">仰光米價較廉 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>現在米商方面、擬向仰光訂購五十萬石洋米、按中國每年有大宗洋米進口、多半來自西貢、惟今年印度方面、亦發生荒災、故西貢米均輸往印度銷售、惟仰光方面當有餘米出口、且價格較廉、按目前市價、大槪爲十元左右、較之我國現在米價廉約二三元、故如有此項洋米進口、米價必可抑平、</p>
<h3 id="c132">旱災面積甚大 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>記者以外外界對於我國現存國米數量、尙無須以洋米接濟、如洋米進口、而使國米跌價、恐將再蹈過去復轍、詢諸顧氏、據顧氏答稱、今年亢旱之區、面積甚大、卽使在此暑天、有雷雨下降、亦已難於挽救、以往年豐收、尙有大批洋米入口、此固與國米跌價有極大關係、但本市米商、現在擬向洋商訂購者、爲數不過五十萬石、且如事實上認爲過多之時、尙可减少數量、故對於國米市塲、可料並無若何影響、</p>
<h3 id="c133">米業呈院核示 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>顧氏復云、現在本市米商雖有此項擬議、但尙須呈請中央核示、蓋此項訂購洋米、純以救濟將來米市着想、如今年不幸而成旱荒、則不獨都市之民食問題、發生恐慌、而農村間亦將發生搶米等風潮、故爲整個民食與地方治安着想、似應及早籌謀防範之策、本市米業公會在呈行政院文内、說明訂購洋米、以五十萬石爲限、不得另有私進之事、且於將來銷售及定價方面、均將通盤籌劃、故政府對於此事、或將提交關係各部、加以研究後、再交民食統制設計委員會負責計劃、本市米業界如政府對於此事認爲可行時、當卽籌集欵項訂購以濟急需云、</p>

<p>世界電訊社云、本年吾國各地、因入夏以來、天時亢旱、阡陌盡成龜圻、田禾枯黄、形成荒象、是以本市米價突飛猛漲、兩三星期中、竟高至四元以外、米糧同業、因有呈請政府、免除進口稅、而購入大批洋米、以備荒之舉、昨據運輸界傳出消息、蘇俄自五年計劃成功後、因獎勵生產之積極促進、以是農工產品、均有供過於求之勢、近聞吾國米價突漲、以爲時不可失、乃將大批過剩俄米運華、意圖傾銷、聞其數量有數十萬擔之鉅、業已由海參崴起運來滬、預料於一週内、可以到埠、本市米業中得到此項消息、故米價已有</p>

<p>神灘在揚子江南口、距離黄浦江口甚近、爲進出輪船必經之處、揚子江口、因地處下游、水流較緩、所以上游之水、挾沙而下、至此停滯堆積、日增月積、淤塞日甚、其神灘淤積處、約距水面二十六尺、若經風浪之吹擊、其深度僅二十尺左右、因之吃水較深之輪船、進出大感困難、𤀹浦局及海道測量局、有鑒於斯、决計加以疏𤀹、以利航行、</p>

<p>疏𤀹之計劃决定後、以神灘地近大海、一片汪洋、工作進行、殊覺困難、且缺乏疏𤀹器械、乃於前年、向外商訂購新式挖泥機輪兩號、每輪價値約二百五十萬元、該機輪係定製、故頗費時日、其中一號輪聞已完工、不久卽可抵滬、𤀹浦局以機輪抵滬後、卽可進行疏𤀹、故對於神灘淤塞情形、須於事前、加以錘測、以利進行、</p>

<h3 id="c209">讀書問答　書籍上的幾個問題　丨答葉國彬君丨 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>我自加入貴部後，很想將你介紹給我的書丨社會科學的基礎知識丨迅速購來讀，讀完後頗有疑問，茲列於下，請爲指示。</p>
<p>一，第一章社會科學段内，有「社會現象都是有意識的至於自然現象則爲無意識的。社會現象都是有目的的，至於自然現象則爲無目的的。社會現象的勞働和自然現象的勞動，他們的形態是相異的：社會現象的勞動之特别形態，是勞働用具的使用和創造爲人類的特色，至於自然現象，大部分是沒有行使自然勞働的，就是行使了勞動的部分，牠的勞動形態也是和社會現象的勞動形態相異的。」自然現象中那些是沒有行使勞動的？那些是行使的？我實在不明白。</p>
<p>二，本書只提及社會科學和自然科學，未知哲學及文學是否屬於社便科學？哲理科學一名詞能否與社會，自然科學兩名詞對立，抑名含於社學内？</p>
<p>三，第三章社會思想，叙述社會主義，無政府主義，國家主義等理論，各是其是，不知那一種比較行得通，有益於人羣？怎樣去鑑别這種種社會思想的好壞，不致誤爲不正確的思想惑？</p>
<p>四，社會思臣與政治思想有沒有分别？</p>
<p>以上是我讀完社會科學的基礎知識一書後的疑問，但我最感不滿的，是這書雖告訴我社會科學的内容，但偏於客觀的叙述，使讀後不知那一種社會思想正確能實行，於大衆有利？那一種社會運動最有效？及錯字太多。（下略）</p>
<p>丨葉國彬來信</p>
<p>答一，自然現象可以分爲生物現象和無生物現象兩種，生物現象中如動物的生活就是要行使勞動的，因爲動物必須用自己的勞力去尋求食物或捕捉食物。無生物不需要營養物，所以用不着勞動。植物雖需要營養物，但它的營養物都長完全靠現成的東西，不必將軀體移動，所以沒有什麽勞動。動物的生活雖然要靠勞働，但它的勞働完全建築在自身的生理構造上，例如虎豹只能應用爪牙，牛馬只能應用角蹄，象只能用鼻子，所以是無意識的，人類則能够不依靠生理構造，另外創造工具，即能够依照自己的需要，將外物的形狀改變，以適合自己的需要，所以是有目的的，有意識的。</p>
<p>答二，普通提到科學，僅指自然科學和社會科學兩種，至於哲學和文學，是不包括在裏面的。但實際上並不能分得這樣嚴格，例如文學在創作方面雖不屬於任何科學，但在理論方面，是必須要當做社會科學的一部分來研究的。哲學對於科學，是立在一種總括的地位上，哲學的内容是社會科學和自然科學的共通的普通的法則，所以哲學可以說是不屬社會科學或自然科學，然而對於兩者都有密切的關係，研究學問切不可把學問的各部門分得太嚴格，要注意各科學的互相聯繫，才不至於局限在狹隘的觀念裏。</p>
<p>答在，關於各種主義的好壞，我們不能站在主觀的立塲上來隨便地輕率地答覆讀者，因爲讀者必須自己能判斷，才是他讀書的目的。至於告訴讀者怎樣自己去鑑别好壞，倒是可以的。好的和行得通的主義是什麽呢？一定是一種根據科學的理論而建立起來的主義。甚麽理論是科學的呢？這問題我們就不能單單在書本上求解答，同時還要在現實社會的事實中去打證騐，一種理論如果不是片面的，誇大的，和騙人的，而是能將客觀事實的最眞實的本質暴露出來，那麽這種理論所說明的每一件事物一定都是正確的，而且根據這種理論所發生的人類的行動也是最前進最有效的，用這兩點做標凖，我們就很可以判斷一種主義的好壞。所以，要能判斷得凖確，也是要多少有點閱歷，不是馬上從書本上就可以得到完滿的結論的。書本對我們只有一方面的帮助，即供給一點知識而已，世間决沒有眞正的萬寳全書···</p>
<p>答四，政治思想是社會思想的一部分。</p>

<p>現代國際競雄之利器有三、曰軍事、曰經濟、曰宣傳、而宣傳尤爲世界各種戰鬥中之先鋒、列强對此、組織經營、不遺餘力、其事業最重要而成績最昭著者、則莫過於規模宏大組織嚴密之電訊社、如英之路透、美之聯合、法之哈瓦斯、俄之塔斯、日之電通、其資金輒達百萬、通訊網遍及全球、故能朝發一訊、夕騰萬邦勢力雄厚、收效宏偉、吾國自有新聞事業以來、徒以經濟力量薄弱、交通工具缺乏迄無是項組織、每値國際交涉、即受敵方眩惑、不能取得世界正確與論之援助、以致外交迭遭失敗、至國内報業、亦因無電訊社之輔助、遂使採訪難周、消息遲鈍、所有政治軍事經濟等重要新聞、復受外籍通訊機關壟斷、顚倒事理之是非、分化民族之團結、非特難望其有長足進展、抑且日就頽萎、了無生氣、其危害吾國、民族之深刻化實不在武力及經濟侵略之下、</p>
<p>距今十年前上海報界少數人士、有鑒於此、乃聯絡申報及時事新報兩編輯部同人、於工用之暇、就兩館所得各方專電、撮要編譯、拍發外埠數家有關係之報社、期以敏捷之方法、傳眞確之要聞、旣助各地新聞紙之發展、並以正各界人士之觀聽、是乃「中時電訊社」事業之濫觴也、</p>
<p>試辦數載以後深蒙各地報業推許委託發電者日有增中、兩館同人、勢難兼顧、乃於民國十七年間、釐定組織、擴充資本、另聘專任職員分别編發中英文電訊、社務基礎、藉克奠定、「申時」之名、始爲社會所稱道、而國人經營之新聞電訊事業、亦以「申時」爲其嚆矢焉、嗣應社會之需求、本服務之精神、逐步開拓、業務寖盛、國人對電訊事業與國家民族具有密切關係、亦漸明瞭、報業爲圖業務發展計、對電訊愈加重視、「申時」事工、遂益承各方之贊助而突飛猛進、</p>
<p>自一二八之役興、「申時」工俆、遂隨同淞滬抗日戰爭而驟形緊張、當斯時也、「申時」之特派軍事記者多人、不避艱險、親赴戰區、出入槍林彈雨中、刺探敵我兩方軍情、雖屢瀕於危、然終不稍怯、至内部編輯人員、更無分晝夜、常川駐社辦公、每當前綫情報遞到、立即編發各地報社、是以「申時」所得消息、旣較外籍電訊機關詳確、所發電訊、又最迅捷、博得各方極大之好評、挽回</p>
<p>吾國電訊事業難得之榮譽、各地報業請求「申時」供給電訊者、此後遂紛至沓來、社中原有人員、不敷支配、乃於是夏擴充内部、添聘職員、業務愈見進展、迄今與國内外正式訂約供給電訊之報社、已達百十餘家、其地點國内計有、上海·蘇州·無錫·鎭江·南京·杭州·寗波·蚌埠·蕪湖·安慶·九江·南昌·漢口·長沙·重慶·成都·昆明·貴</p>

<p>「申時事工、原以電訊爲主、藉與外籍電訊社競爭、但對國内外長篇通訊、亦極注重、冀以有系統之叙述、補充電訊之不足、所有特約通訊記者、幾已遍佈各重要都市、另聘各邊遠省區通信員、寄發邊陲要訊、復迭派旅行記者、巡視東北西北各省及長江珠江各流域、採集各地有關國計民生之消息、閩變發生時、嘗派員航飛粤閩及浙邊視察眞相、新疆内部常起糾紛、更特約專員、由包綏入新、實地考查、最近更派員人贛省匪區、作精確之紀述、對上海本埠新聞之採訪、則注重政治之設施、外交之轉變、都市金融與鄉村經濟之消長、社會意識與民生形態之動向、抱守重質不重量之原則、屏絶人云亦云之傳聞、此外添設攝影製版各部、作時事問題之生動的描寫、並應内地各報之請求、特創輕便之澆版機、以極經濟與敏捷之手續、使各項新聞攝影得刋載於交通阻梗各地之報紙、餘如輔助各地報業、經理廣告與推銷、爲求報業聯絡、籌辦調查與出版、舉凡有利於我報業之事工「申時」均樂爲努力、次第興辦、</p>

<h3 id="c211">論家 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 川入</p>
<p>談到「家」，早就鬧過一次笑話。當我在北平的時候，某大學一西人教授，解釋中國的家字，說是一間房子裏滿滿地裝着豕，這就是中國的家。當然聽講的大學生大譁，認爲西教授有意侮辱，結果把他驅逐掉了。於是有些人說，西人不懂中國文字學，所以把家字解釋錯了。其實照文字學的大著說文上謿：家是从宀，豭省聲，周伯溫曰：豕居之圈曰家，故从宀从豕，後人借爲家室之家。某西教授的解釋，並沒有錯，豭豕還不是一義嗎？</p>
<p>中國古代的家，不但和現在一夫一妻的小家庭之家，大大不同。並且和舊式包含父子替妻兄弟伯叔妯娌等的大家庭之家，也是大大不同的。那時的家差不多和小國一樣，所謂千乘之家百乘之家者是。直到現在，這般最古式的家，還不是沒有，請看某一個人闊起來了以後，跟他吃飯的，千百成羣，類多可以不做事而游手好閒，頂了一個家臣的頭銜，隨時可以混差事。家於是乎大，而國於是乎吃虧了！</p>
<p>目今最先進的國民，已在那兒做社會人，而我們還牢牢不放的要做家人。諺云：「一人有福，帶連一屋。」我不知此屋下住的是什麽？</p>
<p>大學曰：「欲治其國者，先齊其家。」傳第九</p>
<p>章云：「其家不可教，而能教人者，無之。」由此足見家在道德上的重要性了。本來齊也，教也，是够麻煩的事，要齊之教之，必富養之，因此人人懷私，只顧擴大自己家私的範圍。又有一般人嘖嘖稱而羨之曰：「某人家私不小！」某人的家私旣不小，於是「一家不哭而一路大哭一了！哀哉吾見亦多矣！</p>
<p>有一妙喻於此。據說中國人的家，好比是火車頭，後面掛着一列列的花車客車乃至行李貨色車。當然火車頭是家長。火車頭衝來衝去，累得滿頭是火，滿身是汗，有時太苦了，感覺得拖不動，於是停歇一下嘆幾口怪氣（汽笛）！倘使一不高興，火車頭忽然行動越起軌來，拖在後面的，全都要死於非命。</p>
<p>那麽我們應該怎樣呢？我們應該不再做火車頭，應該駕着飛機滿空飛，摔死了不過是我一個人，陪我同乘而死的，頂多不過三五個。這意思是說我們再不要爲家而犧牲了，再不要努力擴充自己的家私了，我們應該做一個知由的社會的人！不然，與我們的家有關係的人，就</p>
<p>免不了做宀下之豕！</p>
<h3 id="c212">熱在南京（一） <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 曙山</p>
<p>熱，熱，熱，這殆已爲今年夏天普遍的呼聲。</p>
<p>只因我現在還在南京挨着熱，並不知道别處熱究竟是怎樣，一如别處的人也必不知道南京的熱到底爲何如是一樣的，於是我遂於揮汗之餘，且把南京的熱報告於讀者之前。</p>
<p>南京天氣，自入夏以來，其早熱即爲三十年來所未有。溯自上月二十四日起至今日止，在此二十日之間，僅於本月一日晚，曾降過暴雨一陣，而溫度亦疾轉增高。迄五日之室内溫度，竟達華色表一百零四度，十日雖略爲减低，猶達九十八度五，但十一日又突增至一百零三度。昨今兩日，炎威更烈，即於昨日正午之室内溫度，已升至一百零二度，下午復繼續增高，竟達一百零八度五。置身於室内，眞感覺如處於火窟中，一刻都不易忍耐。</p>
<p>這樣的旱，這樣的熱，也無怪那些農民都呌苦連天，曾經想出燒香拜佛或縛龍游行等的種種方法去求雨。實則我們雖住在都市中，又何嘗不渴望甘霖之早降，以之救荒解熱呢？這幾天來，只因爲災象已成，米已一石陡漲到兩元以上，靑菜等亦漲到加倍價錢了，而我們又不能把嘴封起來了吃，或把褲帶勒緊就可以不餓，所以也當然與農民一樣的在急待着下雨。更何况以這酷熱在都市中，簡直像蒸籠裏的熱氣一樣的蒸着人難耐，勢非痛痛快快的下塲大雨不能消解呢？</p>
<p>畢竟這種罕有的災象，足以打動人間活佛的慈心。這就是在西子湖心主持息災救國時輪金剛法會而回來了的班禪大師，他不忍見芸芸衆生如此的受苦，遂想以其佛法去感動天意，於是乃到處設壇誦經以祈雨。只怪那天意梗傲，不肯准情，而且也呌他在赫赫火官的火傘之下，汗流氣喘，禦熱無方，終於在今天也離開了南京，殆爲避暑而赴北平了；雖說他到北平以後還要爲我們祈雨。</p>

<p>美國的文藝批評家Ｈenry　Neumsch曾經說過一句話，「文學是個人的心靈的調子，文學是個人的意志的符號。」這話當然未免說得太過，然而我們可以承認，就是在文藝的作品裏，自我的精神是深深地統治着，一件文藝作品不外是「客觀事物之主觀印像的抄錄」，「時代意識之自我精神的表現」，在作者的腦海與環境的事物起了反射的作用懷胎意識時，自我的精神是在無意識之中擔任着濃厚的勢力，讀作者的作品，無異受作者之思想的誘導，受作者之情緒的感化，比如讀Ｌermantoff的詩，是有</p>
<p>豪放的韻節，在言語的毅力裏，可以聽到戰劍的響音。Ｊutcheff的詩；是有怪誕的神秘的意味，正如古代的預言者在月中的深夜，說着一</p>
<p>種恐怖的危語。Ｈekrasoff的詩，是粗拙的深沉</p>
<p>的調子，是被損害的人類的激烈的情緒，受撫亂的良心的悲歌。拜倫雪萊的詩，富於浪漫的艷麗的質素，烏特烏新的詩則有自然的深沉的風味。我們讀他們的詩，如見他們的人，字句的排列，暗示他們心的躍跳，因爲在他們的作品裏，他們的個性表現着，他們的精神流露着，每個偉大的作家，多是有他的特殊的風格，而我們也可以說，唯有忠誠地毫無一點虚僞的表現出自己心靈的秘密的作品，才是成功而偉大的精神的產物。</p>
<p>米塞說：「個人有個人的酒杯，我雖用小杯喝酒，但是這酒杯是我的」，朋友們！要記住這句話呵！用你的思想來寫出要寫的東西，不要太看不起你自己，不記得歌德在一首詩呌做「自覺」中所說的話嗎？</p>
<p>無論你是什麽人丨丨這是毫無區别，</p>
<p>你丨丨總是一個人，請不要自賤，</p>
<p>看一看自己丨丨你自己要說，不錯！</p>
<p>做成自我，是想要獲得精神收穫的最要條件，做成自我，却就是滿足了自我，做成自我，也就是否定你自己，不記得易卜生的話嗎？</p>
<p>殺死你心内的自己。</p>
<p>且聽着做成自己丨丨那就是丨丨</p>
<p>永遠地用自己表現，</p>
<p>那主人願用你所表現的事情。</p>
<p>朋友們！具體的說，做所自我，就是發展你内心裏所含積的力量，和那些因習統及對於心靈的獨立性裏所恐懼所壓止而剥削了的能力，那力量和能力是你的作品的原料，可以使得你得到一點雖然是微弱的但是有光榮的成功。</p>
<p>違反着靈魂和良心所寫出的東西，是微賤的，是卑陋的，總要用你自己表現你自己呵！排斥一切形式的勢力，去了各種驕傲的態度，信仰你自己，不顧着利害，自己認爲可以吐露的東西，不妨把他吐露出來，記得歌德的幾句話如在Ｄer　Sagor所唱着的一般：</p>
<p>我在這裏凊謳，</p>
<p>好似一隻小鳥兒唱在枝頭，</p>
<p>歌聲迸出自我的歌喉，</p>
<p>這便是我無上的報酬。</p>
<p>在末尾，我敬以這一段小詩，貢獻於當今的作家。</p>
<p>「聲音雖小，要出自你自己的咽喉，」正如米塞所云：</p>
<p>「個人有個人的酒杯，我雖用小酒杯，但這酒杯是我的。」</p>
<h3 id="c214">七月十四 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 致立</p>
<p>今年在上海的法國民主紀念節，特别熱鬧，如申報所記：</p>
<p>「今歲燈綵，較往年尤盛。法領署·公董局·各捕房·救火會·衛生處·法國營盤·及顧家宅花園·均遍紥燈綵。而尤以公館馬路一帶，五色繽紛，耀目欲眩，近霞飛路·麥高包祿路·八仙橋·法大馬路三處之仿我國古式之巨大燈塔牌樓，更惹游人駐足。」</p>
<p>而在這樣的盛况之下，趕熱閙的，却多半是中國人，這有如台生先生在「新上海」上所記：</p>
<p>「夜，推開了銀燈燦爛，法蘭西民主紀念的狂歡節。</p>
<p>到處飛起了紅，藍，白，法蘭西的旗幟，街上，到處串長了次殖民地被統治者黄臉的人兒。</p>
<p>辣斐德路上，一排地，拉長了孩子，女人，背心上劃着十字背帶時裝的女人，流行裝的背帶，白褲的年靑人兒，手心裏，綠色的法公園的入塲券，黄色的法公園的長</p>
<p>票。</p>
<p>心是那麽火辣地，吹着七月夜凉的風。法公園的門口，火樹燦爛地畫着紅綠的燈</p>
<p>，兩邊，人由十字街直向入口處直衝。</p>
<p>是法蘭西之狂歡節呵！黄臉的人兒，全像不要命的推開了靑蓮色武裝巡捕的防綫，衝過了安南黄色武裝人兒的衛隊，衝呵！向裏面衝呵！這些瘋狂黄臉的人兒，推着時裝背心上的十字背帶，推着老太太們的拷皮衫，由黄臉人兒的擁擠的小道裏，衝過了門口的防衛綫。</p>
<p>瞧：燈火燦爛，這不夜之城的法蘭西狂歡節呵！</p>
<p>瘋狂黄臉的人兒！這是法蘭西的狂歡節</p>
<p>呵！這被統治者可憐的人兒，竟忘了這是法蘭西民主紀念的花園呵！」</p>
<p>黄臉的人兒實在是愛趕熱鬧的人兒。他們的趕熱鬧就是趕熱鬧，不管那熱鬧的是什麽。管它法蘭西民主紀念呢，總之，它比中華民國的民主紀念熱鬧得多，這就好了。反過來說，上海的法蘭西民主紀念節，要不是有這麽多的黄臉的人兒法趕熱鬧，那麽，「仿我國古式之巨大燈牌樓」等等，豈不是虚設了。而這，從統治者方面說來，是與民丨統治者丨同樂，給了恩惠，同時也要求感戴和擁護，所以，在公館馬路的「大自鳴鐘」下面，有兩句標語：Ｖivela　Francel（法蘭西萬歲）和Ｖive　la　garde　municipale　de　Changhail（上海的市衛隊萬歲！）然而，在「火樹銀花，城開不夜」的情形下面，「縱情陶醉，得意忘形」的，豈止黄臉的人兒們？即使是法蘭西民主的國民，看了中國古式的巨大燈塔牌樓，也何嘗會想到要紥這個牌樓的所以然而記起一百四十五年前的巴黎的七月十四日的情形？</p>
<p>一百四十五年前的七月十四日，巴黎的情形，大略如左記：</p>
<p>「巴黎的民衆，早有凖備，十三日的晚上，已有一隊一隊的武裝羣衆，走近巴士提爾堡壘，曾與守兵開槍互擊。十四日的淸早，就大隊地在向巴士提爾去的大路上集合起來了。他們也有大砲，是從傷兵院奪取過來的；也有槍枝和火藥，是從窖室和教堂裏搜尋得來的；有的是拿着戈，矛，鎚，斧，有的甚至只有簡單的木棒。堡壘的司令官從牆頂望下來，吸見整個聖安多納區的通衢和小巷一片黑色，暴徒們的頭顱，波浪一般地逼近過來。怒潮一般地響着的聲浪，則是：「我們要巴士提爾堡！把吊橋放下來！」司令官被這情形嚇得幾乎昏暈過去了。</p>
<p>「巴士提爾堡外部的第一道大吊橋，不久便被攻破了。羣衆湧進了司令官的辦公廳。巴士提爾的守兵就開槍抵敵，兩下開火至三個多鐘頭之久，羣衆死傷得很多，但是他們毫不膽怯，仍用種種方法圍攻。同時，巴黎全城的人民都起來，携着大砲，</p>
<p>來作後援。</p>
<p>最後，守兵終於投降了。司令官交出了開裏面的小吊橋的門的鑰匙，羣衆佔據了這個堡壘，釋放了埋在監牢裏的囚犯。這時的情緒非常激動，羣衆看見了囚犯們的樣子，至於淚下，囚犯們見了太陽的光綫，聽了羣衆歡迎他們出獄的呼聲，竟至昏迷了。」（見徐懋庸：法國革命史，新生命大衆文庫本。）</p>
<p>起像起來，這情形是比一九三四年的上海的七月十四日更熱鬧的，然而這兩種熱鬧有怎樣的不同。一百四十五年前的巴黎的七月十四。法蘭西的暴徒摧毁了代表法蘭西的封建政治的巴士提爾堡壘，一百四十五年後的同日，法蘭西的在上海的統治者，與黄臉的人兒同樂，同時其中也有着被統治的法蘭西國民。</p>
<p>巴黎的短褲黨所創造的七月十四日紀念，被法蘭西的資產階級所覇佔，命令「普天同慶」，擁護法蘭西共和國於萬歲，於是連黄臉的人兒也在燈綵下面凑熱鬧。</p>
<p>然而，上海的黄臉的人兒們所善於凑的，似乎只有這一種熱鬧</p>
<h3 id="c215">一座牆（六） <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Ｒoberto　Bracco原著席滌塵譯</p>
<p>他將龐大的外套一哀，拐着病腿走了，邊走邊嘴裏頭經抽搐地咒着「去，去討飯去，去討飯去！」</p>
<p>靑年站在桌前，一動不動，可是安詳鎭靜，輕柔地連聲說道：「從今天起，來熬受飢餓！」但是誹謗的文章終究不曾寫。爲了什麽，爲了什麽緣由他不曾寫？他說不上來。他望望四</p>
<p>周。百葉窗依舊關着。他房間裏依舊是夜，從街上，從鄰屋裏，在醒來的混亂聲中，輕柔地</p>
<p>輕柔地浮起一天的新的生命。機聲停止了。古老堅實的牆又是牢不可透。牆壁是不曾將天亮</p>
<p>時候，有個酒鬼用獄者的鑰匙開進門來，响一夜未睡的女子說了幾句口腔不穏的廗滲透過來。走進來時，他曾經對她這樣說道：「要如你到中午時候不給我東西吃的話，我要像絞小雞一樣的絞你的頸骨！」</p>
<p>現在這爛醉的傢伙早經睡去，睡得渾然爛熟了。那女子，把一捆機上踏好的襯衣挾在臂下</p>
<p>，預備出去，想到有可以滿足他願望的方法，不覺高興。離開房間之前，她想起了她的鄰居</p>
<p>來，她這可憐的快樂丨甚而至於她的性命是虧得他憐憫的寛容才得到。</p>
<p>他輕輕叩牆。靑年打顫，其時他正坐着類乎白痴一般的在向着潔白無字的紙張白話。「討飯？但是縫衣機却免得我去玷辱丨去中傷丨一個好人丨你問我微笑嗎丨你問我微···」</p>
<p>他聽得出是隔室的女子在喚他，他也就輕輕叩牆答復。於是兩者同時將嘴唇凑到牆上去，同時說道：</p>
<p>「謝謝你！」</p>
<p>這句愉快的話兩方面都沒有聽到，因爲是兩張嘴同時觸到相隔的牆壁的緣故。每一個離開</p>
<p>牆的時候，口裏却不約而同的喃喃說道：</p>
<p>「並不是她！」</p>
<p>「並不是她！」</p>

<p>再者、球員若是不儘量使着順勢力、那麽擊球時、推進的力量、必要無形地遲緩、所以要避免力的鬆懈、除非是球拍順着手臂將力量使用盡了再停止、才能做到、於是要球拍擺動時輕便靈活、就非使盡順勢力不可、再進一層、球拍隨着手臂將力量使用罄盡、還可以自動地影響到擊出地球的扭轉、此種球的扭轉、在以後討論拍擊方法和球的扭轉地效用時、再來詳細研究、</p>
<p>（按）此叚應接在第二章之末、即十六日所載（六）之末節、以下乃接下七日所登第（七）之後（即第三章發球）</p>
<p>發球時、網球家所採用拍擊方式、是各有不同的，但是無論如何、最通行的方式、是在未實行拍擊以前、將手臂轉到頭部的後面、手腕將球拍折轉、使拍頭向後、有的球員祇將拍頭往下到和手腕成水平綫、還有的球員將拍頭往下到肩膀以下或是憇在肩膀上、拍頭往下的時候、手腕是向後灣的、拍擊時、由肩部而手臂上部而手臂下部劈向前面的力量、就將手腕和球拍拖向前面、但此時球拍仍垂在手腕之後、要在實行擊球時、手腕再馬上將球拍向前折轉過來、球拍伸直、向球重重地劈去、</p>
<p>發球一定要將球轉向下斜射的、越過頭頂的發球若不將球扭轉向下、實際上是不可能的、因爲拍擊時、若僅豎起球拍、將球直向對方射去、祗要球的速力略强、就難免不越過界限、由此看來、將球扭轉、不僅可以領導球的飛程、還可以</p>
<p>使球剛巧落在對方發球區的界綫以内、</p>
<p>拍球扭轉的方不地、以後再祥細研究、現在祗要知道將球扭轉是要使球的飛程成斜綫、不是一直平飛出去、若是球員從側面扭轉球身、球必因觸着球拍的側面、略爲扭轉方向飛去、所以擊球時、拍頭向前轉撲、就會發生扭轉球身的趨勢、使牠略爲向下飛落出直綫以外、扭轉的力量愈大、拍擊的力量要愈重、並且還能使球確切地落</p>
<p>在對方很窄狹的發球區以内、</p>
<p>根據上述的原則、美國人發明了一種扭轉發的方式、並且已經證明是很有效力的此種方法擊球時的力量很重、同時加以在球身側面的絶大扭轉力、於是球就迅速的向對方旋轉去、而且極快的落地、然後從地面發出一種極難預測的反躍、如要產生此種效力、發球者的身軀要先往後仰、然後順勢伸直、當球和球接觸時、拍擊的動作、是向上和向外的、</p>
<p>此種美國扭轉發珠的方式、最難做到的地方、就是要在可能範圍以内、使球和球拍有長時間的接觸、於是球身能够在拍面上旋轉一周、使球飛出時有極快的旋轉力、球拍最初和球接獨的地方、是在球的下方後面、然後乘勢轉向上和向外而往右邊、在將要拍出的時候、拍頭還要和球的頂上接觸、使牠斜向地面飛到對方去的時候、發生極快的旋轉力、此種美國發球方式、是很難學的、初學者對於普通越過頭頂的直射式、還沒有精練的時候、最好不要輕於嘗試、</p>
<p>發球的基本工作、旣然是要球飛過網、又要剛巧落在限制的區域内、所以初學者非儘量的苦練是不易成功的、練習時、最好請一位朋友站在對方、以便將球擲還、於是一而再、再而三地將球發到對方去、一直練到每次都能達到目的、那就算成功了球藝的初步、</p>
<p>再者、手法要愈練愈快、直練到球飛出時有絶對的凖確性、若是球向對方直射、落點時總是凖確地越過發球區的界綫數英呎以外、此時初學者决不可灰心、應當再加上一悉功夫那麽球的飛程可以很容易地縮短、並且擊球時的動作還是很快的、那就要用上述的扭轉擊法了、球身因被很重的扭轉力所逼、當然飛出時不致於仍成直綫、而牠的飛程也因此縮短了、</p>
<p>發球的實際動作、是要藉着手臂向前撲的趨勢、手腕趁勢將往後的球拍扭轉過來、再藉着肩部和手臂所發出的力量、將球很快地掃擊嶶前去、此時球拍極快的動量、加以體重和肩部的轉動、於是使球射出的力量極大、</p>
<p>發球動作至最後球將離拍時、手臂要順着勢將球拍儘量地向下撲去、好像平常在塲中回擊來球一樣、要將順勢力使盡才自然地停止、有的網球名手拍球出後的動作是各異的、有的球拍要儘量地向下撲、拍頭直到左足的左方、或右方、或是正在左足的前面、至於美國的扭轉發球式、因爲球拍是向旁邊撲的、所以拍頭落下時、總是被拖到球員身體的右面、有的善於使用扭轉法的球員、拍頭僅僅落在右膝的右邊、還有一二球員落拍比這更高、甚至僅僅在右邊的外面、</p>
<p>發球時失誤、第一次可說是「過」、第二次是「罪」、所以一次失誤以後、就要集精會神、决不使牠再蹈前轍、因而失掉一分、富有經騐的球員、發球時從沒有因疏忽而失誤的、發球時、决不要免强用力、越是免强、越是容易失誤、所以要常常練習、使拍擊的手法、是極端地自如、輕描淺寫、態度從容、而發出的球、又凖落在摑凖的地位、即使一次失誤、猶能神色自若、那才算是深知球</p>
<p>藝的個中三昧、</p>
<p>發球的特權、旣然到手、就必要利用到盡善、决不要使此種攻擊的武器、雖有若無、</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在我平生所見過的許多人裏面，他眞可算是一個最不幸的脚色了！同時，他又是一個最討人憐惜的人。</p>
<p>我想，這一次上奉天去的遠游，對於他，至少會有一些安慰吧！</p>
<p>（十）（一）女官和宮女</p>
<p>太后這一次上奉天去，爲車輛的容積所限，一切的排塲，都大事緊縮；就是貼身服侍的女官和宮妇，伊也不能多帶，除我們八個女官全跟着伊同行之外，伊只帶十六名宮女，這些人都是不拿一文薪工的，算是義務職。我們這些女官的來歷，差不多全是滿籍高級官吏的女兒；而那些宮女，却是從許多滿洲兵將的女兒裏頭挑選出來的最美麗的。在名義上講，女官當然是比宮女來得高貴，但從實際上着想，我相*</p>
<p>信有許多地方，確是做宮女的比做女官的舒服。</p>
<p>在淸宮裏當女官，不但拿不到俸給，而且還是一個顚倒要賠錢的苦差使。老實說：當我和我的妹妹在宮裏面的時候，我父親時常要拿錢送進來給我們使用。每個月，我和容齡兩人，光是賞給那些廚子的錢，就是整整的一百兩；禁不起太后還要不時賞賜東西給我們，那就化費得越發厲害了。因爲太后把東西賞賜我們，總得教太監捧着送來的，這些太監就非給他們力錢不可；而且他們都有一副充滿着商業化底思想的頭腦，要如太后一次賞我們六七件東西，他們就會每人拿一樣，分着六七次送來，他們這樣一弄手段，我們的錢就格外容易出去了丨譬如六七件東西在一次送來，那我們只須給他們二三十兩銀子的力錢就行了；他們分成了六七次，我們每次至少就得給十兩，合併起來，便是六七十兩了。（八五）</p>

<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>在某一年淸江浦曾經發生過這麽一件事：是XXX軍隊攻打淸江浦的時候，淸江浦城裏連一個兵都沒有了。而那慣會殺人放火的XXX軍，已經開到離南門祇有五六里的地方，眼見就可入城了。要是他們進了淸江浦的城，地方一定會糜爛的。但是這時淸江浦的人們，一個個都躱在家裏，街上連一個人都沒有，怎能阻擋這一隊强盜兵呢。在這千鈞一髮，危險萬分的當兒，突然出現了一位老嫗，伊是不忍看見偌大的淸江浦，遭他們這般强盜兵姦淫擄掠，所以拚着一條性命，想挽回這個刦運。於是伊裝扮了一個賣山芋的，背着一個木桶，裏面裝滿了熱騰騰的山芋，在距南門二三里的地方，高呼着：「賣山芋啦！」「賣山芋啦！」一忽兒，ＸＸＸ的兵到了，看見有賣山芋的，就搶着來吃，並且問伊到淸江浦去走那一條路？伊就指着一條到别的地方的岔路告訴他們，果然，他們竟上當了。等到他們覺悟，已經受了欺騙，再往這條路走回來的時候，救兵已經到了，於是淸江浦竟得保全，這老嫗看見目的已達，心願已遂，也就不聲不響的回來了！後來，淸江浦的人知道了，說是觀音菩薩的變化，於是一直傳說到現在，一叚很好的故事，竟變作一篇神話。</p>

<p>有一次，我經過南京路大陸南塲的前面，看見一個服飾都麗的上流人昻然從黄包車上跳下來走進中國國貨公司去，那個人還很年靑，也帶點紈袴氣。但他車錢却沒有給，黄包車夫等着等着，等得不耐煩了，更急燥地呌囂着。自然，我對他只有同情，沒有討嫌，車夫多半是可憐的。</p>
<p>爲了同情他，我站立在旁邊，想看一個結果。（雖只也僅是無裨無裨實際的關切）但是在十分鐘之後，那乘客終究還沒有出來，車夫沒法，拉了旁的主顧走了。</p>
<p>嗚呼，所謂上流人！</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>又一次，是在英國駐滬軍營的門前。兩個患貧血症的中國少女在和英兵搭訕着，用指頭代話，在講價錢，我知道那便是所謂「鹹水妹」了。</p>
<p>價錢講不妥，中國少女在策略上是要走了，可是四隻脚搬得很慢：那邊英兵在高呌着，大槪是想轉圜罷。路旁許多小販和車夫，看到那種情形，都在恥笑着，有些甚至還說些不好聽的話，祗是我有的是同情，有的是鬱結的不愉快的心！</p>
<p>我希望以後再也看不到那些。</p>

<p>二爺對我說，他們嫂子和黄家有點遠親，所以彼此認識了。我看那情形，兩個人很親熱，大槪是公開的，我就索興通他一句，笑問道：什麽時候，我們能和甘二爺討酒喝呢？這是一句攏統子的話，說是問着了黄小姐也可以，說是沒有問着黄小姐也可以，他倒很明白，就說早着啦！早着啦！黄小姐站在一邊，只管微笑。你想，這事情不是明擺着在這裏了嗎？桂枝聽到這篇話，說不出來心裏有那一分酸甜苦辣，心裏跳着，臉上紅着，許久，才道：這可是新聞了。趙翁道：得了，别談了，我們說正經的吧？說着話，他把臉偏向了江氏，因道：這回我到城裏去，倒是辦了一點兒正經事。我那老東家對我說，你兒子又不在西苑大樓，你何必還住在海甸呢？就要我搬到他糧食店後院去住。他說，也不是讓我白住房子，店舖裏不免有點小事，請我照應。我想着也好，一來我住到城裏去，朋友多一點，天天可以找點不費勁的事作，免得怪悶的。第二那兒離着產科醫院不遠，將來桂枝過月子，有點照應。我回來給你們商量商量，樂意不樂意？桂枝聽了說要搬到城裏去，首先臉上有了笑容了。江氏看到他翁媳二人意見一致，自然也不違拗，於是商議了一陣，决定了三天之後，搬進城去。這一天，趙翁先進城去佈置房屋，江氏將動用傢具堆在大車上，同小林一路壓了大車。惟有桂枝是個懷孕的人，不能坐那笨重車子，雇了一輛本街上的熟識人力車將他慢慢的拉了進城去。（四三六）</p>

<p>— 周君奇</p>
<p>旅館裏的電燈是那麽昏黄的慘黯的！</p>
<p>我和Ｋ君坐在床沿上閒談。突然房外走進來一個老女人：伊的那副佈滿雞皮般皺紋的臉孔，襯托着兩顆靈活的眼珠子，呌人見了生厭。伊的背後跟着一個年紀約莫十七八歲的帶有些鄉下習氣的姑娘，很自然地立在門檻外。</p>
<p>「先生，要不要個姑娘陪陪··」老女人說。</p>
<p>藏之安危　牧羊者藏西</p>
<p>「·······」我們不約而同的下意識的向那個姑娘投了一個詫奇的眼光。老女人便很機巧地伸手去拖那個姑娘到我們的面前來。</p>
<p>「呌一聲先生····」老女人命令那姑娘。</p>
<p>「先生······」年輕的姑娘低下頭貼到胸前，紅暈浮上伊的面頰，聲音是那麽微微地，微微地。</p>
<p>但我們意識到這件事體有些蹊蹺，顯然伊們兩個不像是親生的母女關係，而另有一種特殊的表徵，從那個姑娘的低俯着的羞紅的面龐上，和那對憂鬱的恐懼的眼晴裏暴露出來。</p>
<p>「伊是不是你的母親？」素性急躁的缺乏世故的Ｋ君指着老女人向伊追問了；</p>
<p>「······」年輕的姑娘膽怯地不敢訴說伊的隠痛似地躊躇了一會，勉强從伊的梗塞着什麽東西似的喉咽裏，出了一句「是的···」，那種聲音是十分酸楚的，幾乎是哭泣的。尤其是那副臉孔的表情，好像是一頭待宰的小羔羊的乞憐的表情，那樣動人的。</p>
<p>然而，老女人陡的變了臉色，接着就惡狠狠的說道：「走，走！」年輕的姑娘跟着老女人走出房門啦！終於消失在走廊的盡頭。</p>
<p>旅館裏的電燈仍是那麽昏黄的慘黯的</p>
<p>，我們惘然地沉然在寂寞的圍氛裏！</p>

<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>▲從伯林　來的信（下）</p>
<p>在四月天氣，夜色很快地降落在北方。伯林的黄昏，便變成一個童話的世界。天空星辰發射出怯弱的閃光，那都是巧奪天工的人爲燈光。</p>
<p>在夜上，我們在伯林大都會裏，可以看見許多强烈的白熱燈，照射着各種巍峨的建築物。地座宮殿式的議院，浸在電光中正像是一座水晶宮一般無異。</p>
<p>伯林之議院</p>
<p>在都市裏住得久了，不妨到柏林附近郊外去呼吸樹林裏的淸鮮空氣。那座有名的「無愁别宮」，是德國的凡爾賽宮。在别墅附近，我們可以憑吊那座呌做「無愁」的風車磨坊。據德國一件沿傳下來的寓言，說從前在那個磨坊裏，住着一個老年的主人，皇帝在磨坊附近造了一座别宮和御花園，他看中了那座磨坊，要坊主讓給他。那裏知道那個老頭兒固執不肯。有人替他扭憂，說是得罪了皇帝，恐要遭意外之禍。老頭兒坦然回道：「皇旁有他自己的宮園，儘可以自由逍遙，磨坊是我的產業，我有我的權利，若使他要來侵佔，我可以到法院裏去告他，有什麽愁慮呢。」這便是「莫愁别宮」和「莫愁磨坊」得名的來由。</p>
<p>若使要求其他的娛樂，有柏林各大戲院可以从你消磨光陰，南腔北調，什麽都有，你可以揀合你興味的進去，價目高下不同，定一個樂隊前的座位，普通是二十馬克，合比幣一百八十方。（合國幣二十元左右）</p>
<p>這一個富於實行毅力的民族，多麽現代化的民族，是具有音樂家靈魂的民族，他們表現的歌劇，却非去看一次不可。我們在某夜看了一齣「薔薇騎士」，那音樂眞是多麽美妙動人啊！</p>
<p>若使失去欣賞這個音樂歌劇的機會，我們這一次在萊茵河外作柏林的旅行，未免便要感到美中不足。</p>

<h3 id="c277">宣化囚徒宸 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>日前報載中國佛教會函司法院長居覺公，擬請派員赴各監獄宣化囚徒事云：「··查丁卯以前，各省監獄、皆有教誨師，多數爲佛徒所擔任··成效昭著，後因時局多故，此舉或未能行。夫人當順境之時，教以佛法，大都淡漠；若經挫拆，方始覺悟。在身繫囹圄者，及時施行佛法之感化，俾資懺悔，收效更易，卽他日出獄，亦可爲社會良好國民。本會同人有鑒於此，業已呈請鈞院，通令各省市縣法院，准與佛教團體，選派教師，至各監獄宣傳佛教，以資感化··倘蒙俯賜核准，則造福於囚徒者，寗有涯涘。</p>
<p>佛門子弟是以超薦人羣普度衆生爲宗旨，其神恩所及，竟澤敷於「惡漢」與「不軌份子」匯集的監獄囚徒，不能不算是功德無量。我們看西歐的基督教在許多獄囚前大賣其「到耳不到手」的膏藥，拿着十字架把他們送上殺塲，都是使囚徒「懺悔」的實際表現。現在在此社會不安罪囚衆多的時候，佛教會又來吹他的「法螺」了，一則曰及時感化收效更易，再則曰俾資懺悔可爲良好國民，一顆濟世活人之心，海躍於紙上，雖然，濁人道緣猶淺，不能不發生疑問。</p>
<p>首先我固不能不承認，若世間的芸芸衆生都主淸凈無爲與世無爭，其結果</p>
<p>自是塵世的罪惡减少，人人皆「爲社會良好國民」；可是人生來因上帝造人的不完全，卽具有衣食住的要求和各種慾望，而這些事物又爲少部份人所獨佔，爲爭取這些東西以維持生存，致將社會形成爲人生的戰塲，產生無限的「罪惡」。這些要求如果不能正當的獲取，卽社會一天存在「罪惡」之源，濟世爲懷的佛教門徒若要施以感化使其覺悟，那教他們繫緊肚子不穿衣躺地皮，或者可能望他們「懺悔」。</p>
<p>至於所謂當順境之時教以佛法大都淡漠，殆經挫折方始覺悟的罪人，他們大都是失勢的軍人政客，在身繫囹圄時或者來皈依佛法，但是一旦自由，仍是東山再起，重整舊業。他們之信奉「大慈大悲」，只爲暫時「息影」避風頭，就不</p>
<p>能與他日出獄仍爲衣食所迫而走向犯法之途的人，視同一例。若那些「挺而走險」的獄囚，雖然在身繫囹圄之時，也許因「及時感化」而覺悟懺悔，可是在他們守法期滿之後，一樣因飢寒所迫，單是奉着宗師誥訓，恐怕就不能解决他們的現實問題，那時佛教監獄教誨師爲社會良好國民的想望，便不復是「造福於囚徒者，寗有涯涘」矣。</p>
<p>本來宗教就是虚空不着邊際的事，牠不特消極的散佈人們以離現實的幻想，而且積極的彌補罪惡，掩飾太平。社會愈是不安，驅人作「惡」的環愈烈，牠就更其趁此機會來散播「非非境界」的種子。消極方面是將人拉入虚無縹渺之鄉，積極方面是竭力遮飾社會罪惡之源，糢糊人民起謀生存進求改造社會之道。　　因之，全國監獄囚徒雖受佛教感化而懺悔，但出獄後仍有吃飯穿衣的問題；要是使之成爲「良好國民」，絶非皈依佛門，而是對社會有眞實認識與努力。不然，所謂「宣化」者，教人餓着肚子向如來懺悔之舉也。</p>

<p>— 陵語</p>
<p>三烈日下奔波了一天，回寓已是上燈時候。</p>
<p>「今天凉了，你怎到現在方才回來？」這是我寄寓在她家裏的姑，這樣的問我。</p>
<p>「爲了職業有發生問題的可虞，去見了伯伯。」我疲乏而氣喘的回答。「今天這裏倒眞凉快，」我在當風的門口放着的一張凳上坐下，又說。</p>
<p>「今天是法國革命紀念，有提燈會；法國公園還有放燄火，音樂隊，各式各樣的燈綵，外邊熱鬧得很，我們吃過飯，去年噢。』姑姑興怱怱地向我說。</p>
<p>『我不能了，我需要洗澡，然後休息，你們去罷。』我回答她</p>
<p>早已預備了的晚飯，一時吃過了。姑姑闔家大小五人都收拾好去看熱鬧了。</p>
<p>「回頭我們看得好看，你不要懊悔噢！」姑姑臨行時還想挑我同去。</p>
<p>「不懊悔的。」我單純地答。</p>
<p>他們出去了，屋内靜悄悄的祗剩了個我，晚風吹來更有凉意了，我瑞了張籐椅放在洋檯上，赤足露臂的躺着，眼看着天上熌熌的星光，耳聽着遙遠的市聲，在這樣的淸凉靜穆的黄昏裏，我悠然了。忽地我似不堪岑寂，我就起身，出門，追上了姑姑等，但她們並不向法國公園前進，走的是一條我所從未知道的路。我奇怪的問姑：</p>
<p>「這是什麽地方？你們到什麽地方去？」</p>
<p>『你難道不認識這是ＸＸ路嗎？「到什麽地方去？」問的更奇怪，今天不是我國的革命紀念日嗎？ＸＸ會正行着隆重的典禮，盛大的慶祝。你看，不是萬人空巷的都去參加這盛會嗎？』姑姑用手指着一邊這樣的說。</p>
<p>依了她的手指處，果見有一層高高的房屋，上面交叉着我國的國旗，很光亮的在風中飄颭。一陣陣民衆的歡聲，和慷慨雄壯的音樂，從那邊送來，我有些迷糊了。</p>
<p>「日間各商店公共汽車和幾輛私人汽車上不是好好的都飄着紅白藍三色旗嗎？爲什麽現在都一變爲我們的國旗呢？」我低聲的咿唔着。</p>
<p>「還有三色旗嗎？這是我們的國境。」姑姑聽到了我的話說。</p>
<p>「這不是法租界嗎？」我懷疑的問。</p>
<p>「十足的呆子！這是幾十年前的事了。我們的國境是我們的領域。自從那次革命後，一切的不平等條約都取消了，租界都收回了，關稅也自主了。總之，在地球上，我們和别的强國占了同等的地位。爲了這個偉大的革命，今天我們才這樣的歡聲遍地的紀念牠。」姑姑傲然的說。</p>
<p>我默然地想，日間的事，偏說幾十年前事，别的國家的紀念日，偏說我們的紀念日，姑姑爲什麽今天這樣的誑我</p>
<p>。我双囁嚅地問道。</p>
<p>「我日間明知是法，···」</p>
<p>「不用說了，跟我們走吧，到那邊你自然會知道。難道你一定喜歡看到的國家的紀念，而不願參與我們自己這樣一個偉大的紀念節嗎！」她得意地走着說着。</p>
<p>我又迷惑，双快樂，一邊跟着她們走，一邊不自禁地用充滿了喜悅的聲音說：「這是一個偉大的紀念日，這是値得我們紀念的紀念日！」</p>
<p>「睡在這裏，别着了凉，」姑姑推推我的肩低聲地說。</p>
<p>我揉了揉眼，星光在我頭上，市聲遙遠的響著，我仍在籐椅上躺着。我拖了鞋懶懶的走進了自己的房，倒在床上，但心頭仍不停地跳着，一種欣慰，一種喜悅，口裏也仍喃喃的念着：「一個偉大的紀念日，一個値得紀念的紀念日。」</p>

<p>— 風</p>
<p>美國洛克弗勒，人多稱他「煤油大王」，爲世界一鉅富，前日爲其九十五歲壽辰，在紐約州萊克湖故居，舉行家慶，陸氏好玩高而夫球，自認高而夫球爲延年益壽秘訣。</p>
<p>「有錢買不斷黄泉路」，古時雖有這句說話，但是閻王伯伯到底也吃些情面，有錢的人，必定有勢，雖然此路買不斷，但是「緩期執行」，總可以辦得到罷。</p>
<p>陸氏謂高而夫球爲延年益壽秘訣，我决不敢信，倘眞如此，高而夫旣可以延年益壽，就是桌上高而夫球打打，也可以多活十歲八歲了，何怪幾個大花園中，多有高而夫球傷的設備，想必是請幾位遊園的老爺少爺太太小姐們增加年壽的意思罷，</p>
<p>不過有鉽的人，心廣體胖，總是寫意，歡喜什麽，便可去做什麽，這便是延壽的根原，你喜歡賽船，賽船便是延壽秘訣，你喜歡跑馬，跑馬便爲延壽秘訣，你喜歡跳舞，跳舞也便是延壽秘訣，你喜歡賭博，賭博也便是延壽秘訣，有錢的人延壽秘訣多哩豈止高而夫球，</p>
<p>只要有的是錢，住在亭子間中，這樣大熱的天氣，好似薰炙田鷄一般，口中不迭的呌苦，但是有錢有勢的人，住了高大的洋房不算，還要寫寫意意，到各處名山勝地去避暑，這樣的身體，起碼多活八百年。</p>

<p>— 雪書</p>
<p>琴妹死了母親，還是不久以前的事，但是當她母親的臨終的時候，她却在某地做工。我知道得很淸楚，她對於母親的死，一定非常傷心。爲什麽不應呢？她爲了要獨立的生活，她爲了要脫離家庭的束縛，不，更要緊的她要遠離故鄉，以避免和那流氓似的未婚夫結合。於是她在紗廠中掙扎着，像牛馬一般挨過她苦悶的光陰。</p>
<p>近來差不多五個月來不接她的來信，不必說這使我非常疑慮。可是一星期前，却接着她的絶命書了。啊！一個年輕的少女，竟寫出這樣的信來。她的信是這樣寫的。</p>
<p>··珊姊：你記得嗎？算起來我們的分别，已經是兩年多了。可是，珊姊，就在這二年中，我受盡了世間一切的人生痛苦。珊姊，從前我很相信，我是可以這樣飄零下去的。可是，直到如今，我才深深的覺得，一切痛苦完全將我掙扎的勇氣打碎了。可不是嗎？一星期我還這樣想，我總抱定我的不屈不撓的志願在黑暗的社會中，得着光明，總看那末一天斬盡羣妖，殺個痛快，所以我拚命地，犧牲着自己的一切前進，但是，現在的一切都使我絶望了，啊！我追念過去的苦痛，悲傷絶望，我覺得我的心已經粉碎了。這時候，我的心，像給惡魔咬着似的在痛，然而我要忍痛地寫完這信，啊！珊姊，終不禁傷心淚下了。</p>
<p>珊姊，現在我再不能忍痛前進了，告訴你罷：　忍氣吞聲地在那人間地獄般的紗廠裏做了一年來的苦工，那工頭是如何兇猛惡毒，他的面孔是如何令人可怕啊，簡直是隨時都可以吞我下去一樣。從晨挨到黑夜，不見天空，不見白日，更無片刻間給你休息，珊姊，我這脆弱的身體，在如此殘酷的人間地獄中，當然是難免不病，當我病着的時候當然不能再去工作，只好就在那鴿栅般的閣樓裏住了一個禮拜，珊姊，我所有的衣被等··都被我當盡了，然而本月份的房租，還是沒有付出。珊姊，原來天下人心都是像煤炭一般黑的呀！房東見我如此貧困，而且又在病中，今天竟把我趕了出來，當時我只曉得傷心哭泣，不知向何處走，忽然好像我母親在前面引導我。珊姊，我每每在暈眩刹那間，我便看見母親的黑影。於是，我轉悲爲喜，拖着沒勁的脚慢慢地踱過了熱鬧處，走到一個僻靜的地方，哦！到了安身所在了，那死般的寂寞在擁抱着我。珊姊，我母親等了我好久了。現在我用鉛筆在暗淡的街燈微光之下，給你寫這個最後的一封信，假使你能收到的話，那便是遂了我最大的心願了，因爲世界上祇有你才眞是理解我的人。只好在冥冥</p>
<p>中，我祝福你。珊姊，永别了···</p>

<p>— 洋洋</p>
<p>現代商業經營，因爲受着潮流震盪，大多數已放棄其「眞不二價金字招牌」之觀念。并深知道廣告宣傳，影響所及，實爲商戰中最堅强之利器，大有「以此制敵何敵不摧」「以此圖功何功不克」之槪。記得我寄家在津門之時，常常看見天津市華租兩界各業商店，每屆削碼减價，出售貨物時，有的登報啟事，有的散發傳單，并有的在門首張掛各種標語。而唯一使人注目驚異之簡單標語，大率爲「急啦！大賤賣！」「拼啦！出淸存貨！」我們且不談他們是否「眞急眞拼」以及幹那「羊毛出在羊身上」的老法門。總之是屬於競爭營業，也可稱做「慘淡經營」。雖然掉掉槍花，祗要居心可測，似尙未失其商業道德。何况血本攸關，豈有眞正情願吃虧出賣？果眞如此，那些大腹之賈，豈不要個個帶着老婆孩子，預備賠折，一店的職工，也都跟着喝西風嗎？又爲什麽今天某百貨商新張之嘉，明天某有限公司成立開幕呢？他們旣都不是獃子，拿資本兒戲般擲諸虚牝，我們也可了然其一切咧！</p>
<p>不過「急啦」「拼啦」這一類廣告標語之字義維妙維肖聲情并茂的確是充滿了天津衛的地方色彩而値得我們賞鑒和研究。</p>
<p>最近我在本埠石路一家商店門口忽然看見一塊長方式紅牌上面很醒目的寫着兩個黑字是「浪賤」這可不能令我無疑好像北風南漸看上去很帶着道地的天津味兒或者這店主人不要就是一位「衛嘴子」吧？然而浪字在北地是諱言的尤其對女性說話如今這家商店「賤」了還不够，仍必再冠上一個「浪」雖是對着買賣貨物而發言以示眞正减削價碼瀝肝披膽對待顧客一若已無可形容言盡於此了。不過我們苟細細玩味這「浪賤」二字，則又頓覺奇趣横生，忍笑不得！</p>
<p>詎料天下事，無獨有偶，昨天我在天津大公報上忽又發現一家天津商店的夏季大减價廣告。開宗明義，排在店名之上，就是「狠心」兩個大字，推測他「狠心」的原故，也無非與「急啦」「拼啦」等等，站在同一戰綫上，表示情甘吃虧賠本，而推銷貨物。所妙的時間未遠，「浪賤」和「狠心」，南北遙遙相輝映，竟被我先後發覺，細細賞玩一番，也未嘗不是消夏却暑的良方。因爲這一類耐人尋味的文章，最易使你心地淸凉哩！</p>
<p>但有一層如果放眼一看日本和蘇俄對華貿易之傾銷政策也是「浪賤」和「狠心」祗求貨物暢銷虧折血本確所不顧他們當然是帶着政治背景而實行其經濟侵略終於有收穫之一日殆卽所謂「香餌釣金鰲」引你上鈎似此「浪賤」才稱得起眞「狠心」呢？</p>

<p>班禪大師前日在平接見新聞記者，發表意見如下：</p>
<p>「南方苦旱，余在京曾派喇嘛十人赴棲霞山祈雨，結果大雨兩小時，嗣又往寳華山祈雨，大雨兩日」。</p>
<p>班襌大師的法術無邊，祈雨之道我想還是小使其技罷了。</p>
<p>上海紳商各界，見大旱二十多日而不雨，以致米價飛漲，時疫叢生，上蒼有好生之德，於是惟恭惟謹在四明公所設壇祈雨。這比起班禪大師的祈雨來是兩樣的。</p>
<p>班禪大師憑的是佛法，所以他那樣有把握丨致於大師赴平時，車中暴斃隨員四人，那是生死前註定，佛法也是無可挽回的。上海紳商的祈雨，全憑一掬誠心，所謂「誠則靈」，果然今日（十七日）午刻降毛毛雨，雖不「大」，亦可「貴」矣！</p>

<p>是小鳥一樣地活潑，小鳥一樣地快樂，小鳥一樣地嘶喊着，歌唱着，這些天眞可愛的孩子。</p>
<p>孩子們在園地上奔跳着，游戲着，我總喜歡在園後的樓窗口站着望。孩子們一心在玩要上，並未覺察有人在羨慕他，由而帶着笑顏在感傷。</p>
<p>孩子們的肢體天賦給他們以好動，曾不肯稍稍停息，嘴裏的笑語也沒有寗止，他們轉着，爬着，從滑橋上溜着，像大羣愛鬧的麻雀在晨間的林中。他們雖然也會哀哭，但是他們的哀哭不帶人間苦，僅僅爲了一件小得可笑的理由。但不久他又會邊哭邊笑起來了。</p>
<p>看見這些孩子無憚地盡情地玩着，内心不由得來了一陣輕快的感覺。於是走一步跳一步地奔下樓來，一跳一跳地走到孩子們的當中。孩子在打轉，我也打轉，孩子滑橋，我也滑橋，孩子們並不怕我，孩子以爲我是和他們一樣大小的伴侶，毫不因我的加入而生出不自在的舉動。我心不覺一陣歡樂，因爲事實證明我也還是一個頑皮的孩子，是的，我還是一個孩子，一個孩子。</p>
<p>旣以孩子自居，什麽孩子的玩意我都願做，在地打滾啦，呌啦，翻筋斗啦，一切都跟孩子們一樣，但是和孩子們不同的祗有我自己曉得。因爲我每在一跳的時候，我便覺得腿子已經僵硬啦，雖然在孩子們毫不須費力的事情，我却是覺得繁重，骨節已經笨啦，姿體也欠自然了。但是孩子們旣然不把我當做孩子以外的人，多少還保有一點孩子的成分，就這一點，似乎也就頗足自慰的了。</p>
<p>『乖孩子，跟我親個嘴吧·』孩子並不須顧慮，把兩瓣鮮紅的小嘴唇靠近我的嘴，留下一個潤濕的印痕，但是他却把圓而大的黑眼睛望着我嘴唇上的短髭，於是，我傷心了，我知道這刺人的東西已經使孩子的嫩皮受了不快之感。</p>
<p>太陽夜了，孩子們撕打着呌喊着好像大羣的小鳥飛去了，他們跳着，笑着。他們並沒有邀我一同走。於是我獨自留在園地上，淸冷地，跳吧，腿是這樣的笨，唱吧，唱什麽呢？我一手摸着嘴唇上的短髭在獨自個兒沉思着。分明孩子們已經把我毛棄了，祈求天，你把我倒回去十年好嗎？</p>
<p>是的，我離開孩子們已經十年了啊。</p>

<h3 id="c285">觀衆們掩耳盜鈴的政策和明星們所戴的假面具（下） <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>到了現在，一個電話演員弄到了不可說眞實話，而不得不說假話的地步。脚踏實地的說眞話，觀衆們覺得太平凡了。他們一定要依照觀衆們的心理，檢他們所喜歡聽的說，而他們所喜歡聽的，就不外乎虚空的，羅曼諦克的故事而已。美國拳術大王勤通納的所以不能爲大衆所歡迎，雖然他的名字是全國婦孺皆知的，就因爲他太老實了，太不羅曼諦克了。他對於觀衆太忠實了，他不知道投其所好的欺騙他們一下。他常常告訴人說；「我的所以要和人比拳，完全爲的是錢。等到我有了錢，我就不打拳，而安然耽在家裏喝熱牛奶，讀莎士比亞了。」嚇，爲的是錢！喝牛奶？讀莎士比亞！那是多麽不够羅曼諦克的味呀！要是他說：「我爲的是榮名！我成功了，我就游歷全世界，和各國的孔武有力者一較高低！」或者說：「我要到英國，去教威爾斯皇太子打拳！」那大家就轟然鼓掌了。</p>
<p>雷門諾伐羅是很和善的人。你可以請他喝酒他可以一杯一杯地毫不推却的喝下去。他亦很喜歡隨和取樂。你請他到游宴之所，凡是有甜蜜女子和柔軟音樂的地方，他無有不到的。並且在夜闌人散之前，他一定要唱一支「甜蜜的安特琳」，或是彈一曲琴，才可以算一個完全的晚上。雷門娛樂的方法甚多，但是所流傳到「民間」的，不過是他「善於歌唱」的一種而已。其餘的一切，也不便說，也不敢說，何必說些犯衆怒的話呢。還粗人把他宣傳得像傳教的教士一樣，說他好唱聖詩等等，鼓吹得他好像一羣烏鴉中的白鴿，那就更不在話下了。對於瓊克勞馥，亦是如此。你要是不怕人家唾駡的話，你可以說瓊是喜歡夜游的：她常常通宵達旦地在外跳舞尋樂；她喜歡跳却爾斯登，以及種種浪漫不覊的行爲。因爲大衆所知道的是，瓊克勞馥是「野心大於一切」的人！她終日辛勤工作着；她克勝了一切的艱難困苦；她是永遠和環境奮鬥的人！</p>
<p>還有一位「永遠和環境奮鬥」的人，就是琪恩哈羅。報紙上是將她宣傳得好像她是世界人最不幸的一個上，因此千萬觀衆都爲她一掬同情之淚。她第一個丈夫太年輕了；她第二個丈夫又太年老了。他們死的死了，自殺的自殺了，剩留了一個可憐的小寡婦，她還艱苦卓絶的奮鬥着！是的，她是再勇敢沒有的女子了。你要是說句别的話，你可要小心些左右有迷信哈羅的人聽見！</p>
<p>好萊塢所發生的三角戀愛，不要說是世界所不經見，卽好萊塢的居者，亦幾爲之橋舌不下了。那種蔡德頓丨勃倫脫丨定勃斯的三角勾當，弄得人目迷五色，不可向邇了。露絲·蔡德頓和賴爾夫·福勃斯離了婚，而嫁了喬治·勃倫脫；但是露絲還照常的和賴爾夫來往不絶，最近露絲又要和喬治離婚而重歸於賴爾夫了。你想怎樣才是一個丈夫怎樣才是一個好朋友，怎樣朋友而兼丈夫；怎樣丈夫而變成朋友？這個問題三角學裏能替你解决嗎？但是大家所知道的露絲蔡德頓是個受過高等教育，道德很高尙的人。連她喜歡吃口香糖，他們都不知道，不願意知道的。</p>
<p>林肯時代，美國還沒有電影。那時的人心，或者亦與現在不同。崇拜虚僞，逃避現實，并不願知道眞實的事態，情願以虚假聊以自慰，這都是現代人的特性，而是林肯所初料不及的。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c286">評「龍馬俠士」 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｆlaming　Guns丨新光</p>
<p>大槪常看美國電影的人，都會知道有一匹呌湯尼的馬和一個呌湯密士的人。他和牠常在銀幕上往來突擊。現在湯尼已經死了，所剩下的還有一個湯密士。然而他沒有了對手，於是他又找着一匹馬，取名呌作小湯尼。牠，在「龍馬俠士」中出現了。</p>
<p>不過，這種戲我們眞是看得厭倦了。</p>
<p>西部影片的製作者，他們早已有了一種模型，每一部西部影片祇要在這定型中取出來就是，方便得很。然而就因爲如此，我們眞的看得膩了，千篇一律，總是這麽一套。</p>
<p>陳舊的故事，陳舊的導演手法，差不多是用不着從新檢討的，反正，就不過是這麽一會事。</p>
<p>像這樣的西部影片，到現在應當是不必存在的。</p>
<p>但是却有人說西部影片僅僅是給小市民出氣用的，理由是南洋的華僑，因爲受了種種的壓迫，所以愛看而部影片。所以我們（指我們知識份子而言）不必要求作品的正確的「意識」，反正那不過是給「小市民」看的。然而，這一點，不是我們所敢苟同的。正因爲西部影片爲一般知識水準準低落的觀衆歡迎，正因爲那種打武等熱閙的塲面，適合了他們的口味，正因爲西部影片接近了他們的生活，所以我們對於西部影片的作者要求得更加急迫，必須其中有着正確的内容，然後才能成爲有益於「小市民」的電影作品。</p>
<p>何况我們批判一個電影作品，决不是僅僅站在自己少數人的立塲上，反之，我們的要求，一定要成爲一般觀衆的要求，難道說我們觀衆應當將「小市民」除外嗎？再說一句，我們的意見，乃是一般觀衆的意見。</p>
<p>西部影片，爲什麽不應當有新的内容呢？假使說那種特有的影片形式還得繼續存在的話。譬如說現在流行的是英雄好漢，除暴安良，最後是與美人好合以終，那末我們未嘗不可以打擊個人英雄主義，使被壓迫者的羣衆爲正義而奮鬥，肅淸流氓地痞，甚至於肅淸貪官污吏，同樣可以有打武的塲面，同樣可以有騎馬奔馳，爲什麽不能爲一般「小市民」觀衆所歡迎呢？</p>
<p>我們不反對西部影片的形式，但是我們得要求有新的内容。這是我們的結語。</p>

<p>— 莫衰</p>
<p>「雕塑」，「繪畫」，「音樂」，很確切的說；都是推動「文化鉅輪」的主要功具。這些藝術，可以在間接直接方面，賜予「人類」以莫大利益的。</p>
<p>單講上項幾種，中國最落後的，當然是「音樂」了。無論民間，舞台，所演奏的，僅僅是極單調的一些「旋律」。幾千年不變的呆板「節奏」，永遠深深地緊壓着天才者，沒有抬頭的一天！</p>
<p>「器樂」亦是十分簡隔陋的，在中國。「聲樂」呢？一個男子天賦的粗大聲帶，偏要尖着嗓子唱起靑衣花衫來；反之一個女子拉破了喉嚨來唱大花臉。雖然我</p>
<p>國「平劇」研究「咬字」，「運腔」，「韻味」，「板眼」等和歐西在注意「歌唱」中「音階」，「緩急」，「强弱」「節拍」等同一重要；但沒有現實性始終不能前進，失去「音樂」與「人生」原有效果與價値，這弊病是無可掩飾的吧？</p>
<p>歐化東潛以來，對於歌唱，已有相當建設；可惜像一個先天不足，缺乏生長能力的孩子一樣，始終在幼稚時代，逍逝年華！</p>
<p>但是我國的電影，却有特殊速度的進展。它在一般批評家嚴勵督導之下，飛一般地向前馳騁着，在一度再度的轉變中，它吞滅了舊劇的相當勢力，它深入民間，它幾幾乎要衝進世界名片之林了。爲什麽「搖籃曲」「歸來吧」和最近的「漁光曲」，沒幾時，就能風行民間呢？就是因爲它是「電影歌曲」。</p>
<p>「電影」本身是需要「音樂」的，「音樂」可以靠着「電影」傳播出去。那末「音樂」與電影的關係，就不言可知了。同時一付重重的擔子，也就擱到從事電影者的肩膊上去了。</p>
<p>在過去的聲片裏，我們看到了，有從舞台搬上銀幕的「二簧」「西皮」，有同樣流行民間的「緋色歌曲」。但這些都是要不得的陳舊物。</p>
<p>最近的「漁光曲」是變了作風了，（如魚兒難捕船租重，捕魚人兒世世窮）二句眞能抓住意識的中心，而使聽衆會發生無限感慨的。字句也淺顯，誰都能明瞭：不過「旋律」還不十分美麗，但比之其他歌曲要好得好咧。</p>
<p>此外，我們應當如何來樹建「電影音樂」的新途徑丨丨現在限於篇幅，不能詳細討論了。</p>

<p>尼古拉斯公爵是個腦筋簡單的人，他聽了吉爾克的一番話，就帶了吉爾克跑到格萊興大厦中去搜查加泰琳娜的屋子。這樣一搜，竟被吉爾克在一個抽屜的後部尋出了一本書。他打開一看，不是别的東西，就是耐雪的記事簿。這樣更證明了加泰琳娜公主，是耐雪假扮的，而右爾克得到了這個眞憑實據，更覺得驚喜欲狂了。尼古拉斯亦差不得要發狂了，但並不像吉爾克那樣驚喜而已。他覺得這件事，大有蹊蹺。他並且爲眞的加泰琳娜擔憂。因此他覺得不能不通知託龍尼亞國王一下。他就打了一個長途電話給國王。但是尼古拉斯是個嘴鬆的人，吉爾克爲要飭避他洩露消息，保持他獨得之秘起見，就天天陪住了他走東走西。</p>
<p>王寳諸人的出遊，是以十日爲期的。等到他們回來的時候，眞的加泰琳娜公主的病已痊愈了。她住的地方，就是格萊興大厦之中的另一層樓。眞的公主於是就請了假的公主，過去和她見面。加泰娜公主和耐雪相見之下，兩人互相諦視着，竟覺得難分彼此，因此就大相</p>
<p>爰悅起來。她們二人就一起遊息着，一個呌雪雪，一個耐雪，兩個人竟辟除了尊卑上下之見，而逕以小名相稱了。雪雪問道：「你看見過尼古拉斯沒有？」耐雪帶着懌憫的神氣，好偈可</p>
<p>惜，一朶鮮花挿在糞堆上似的，就將關於麥迪生，博德的一切告訴了公主。她並且說道：「麥迪生是極好的一個好人。但是格萊興却心裏非常的恨他。因此，明天晚上舉行最後一次跳舞會的時候，我要替他報一下子讐，將一顆假寳星送給他··弄送弄送他··」雪雪道：「明天晚上，我自己來參加末次跳舞會。」她並且很調皮的笑着道：「就是寳是生不寳星，亦由我來擺佈好了。耐雪，好不好？」耐雪亦就歡然答應了。譁··嗒··嗒··嗒··」長長的喇叭吹着。加泰琳娜。茜歐杜拉。瑪姑利妲公主翩若驚鴻地走了出來，輕移蓮步地走到廣大跳舞廳的一端寳座上就座了。她一回宜言道：「我們在告别之先，願向兩位偉大的美籍人民表示感謝之忱，一位是盧古勒斯。格萊興先生；還有一位是博德，麥迪生先。我們現在謹以敝國最高的榮譽寳星贈給這二位先生。」那二位先生聽見了，就立即走到公主的面前。一位侍從官鵠立一旁手裏捧着一個盛着兩顆寳星的錦墊，一個是眞的寳星，一個是鐵十字章。加泰琳娜公主先拿了一個鐵十字章，要替格萊興别起來了。格萊興連忙低聲喊着道：「不是的，不是的··那一個，那一個··」他當着那公主還是耐雪哩。但是公主竟置之不理，替他别上了一個十字章。那個美少年博德，麥迪生竟安然得到了一個眞的寳星。（未完）</p>

<p>To Hold an Extraordinary Meeting This Saturday to Continue Discussions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held its 169th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 17th. Attendees included Wang Zhaoming, Chen Gongbo, Chen Shaokuan, Wushi Jie, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Shuren, and Luo Wengan. Wang Zhaoming presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>(A) Review of Reports</p>
<p>(1) Minister Huang of the Interior and Minister Kong of Finance reported on the review of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and Qingdao Municipal Government's submission regarding the promulgated regulations on the disposal of public land, requesting a delay in implementation and reporting difficulties in compliance. The review opinions were: (1) Regarding the Zhejiang Provincial Government's submission, it was noted that the provincial government had already submitted special circumstances related to debt agreements and credit. Therefore, it could be handled in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the Public Land Disposal Regulations, with the provincial government compiling the case and submitting it to the Executive Yuan for record. There was no need to postpone the implementation of the regulations. (2) Regarding the Qingdao Municipal Government's submission, it was noted that the city's land administration followed the German system, which differed from other cities. Therefore, Article 5 of the Public Land Disposal Regulations could be invoked to grant special approval for flexible handling. The Executive Yuan should forward the case to the National Government for record. A resolution was passed approving the review opinions. (2) The Ministers of Interior, Finance, Industries, Education, Justice, Administration, Railways, and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission reported on the review of the allocation of qualified examination personnel to border provinces with subsidies. The review opinions were: Given that the allocation of qualified examination personnel was handled by the Ministry of Personnel, the number of qualified personnel to be allocated to remote border areas, as well as the amount of travel and outfit expenses to be provided, should still be determined by the Ministry of Personnel. A budget should be prepared and submitted to the national treasury for disbursement. A draft of the "Provisional Measures for the Allocation of Qualified Examination Personnel to Remote Border Areas" and a "Table of Travel and Outfit Expenses for the Allocation of Qualified Examination Personnel to Remote Border Areas" were proposed for review and approval, and then forwarded to the Central Political Council for approval. The Examination Yuan should instruct the Ministry of Personnel to implement the measures. The resolution was passed and sent to the Central Political Council. (3) The Ministers of Interior, Military Affairs, Finance, Industries, Education, Communications, and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission reported on the review of the "Rules of Procedure for the Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee," the "Rules of Procedure for Meetings," and the "Autonomy Implementation Plan Table." The review had been revised accordingly, and the revision proposals were submitted for review. The resolution was passed approving the review opinions and granting record.</p>
<p>(4) The Ministers of Interior, Finance, and Industries, and the Relief Committee reported on the review of the afforestation plan submitted by the Shaanxi Provincial Government and the plan to establish the Xi'an Observatory. The review opinions were: (1) In the afforestation plan, the proposed establishment of separate district forestry bureaus in Chang'an, Dali, Fengxiang, and other counties should be consolidated into one bureau for unified management. Regarding the establishment of a nursery in each county, it would be better to concentrate financial resources and have the forestry bureau set up nurseries in key locations first, and then expand as financial resources become available. (2) The original plan for the establishment of the observatory and meteorological station was deemed too large and unsuitable. For the establishment of a meteorological station, the province should temporarily enhance the existing Xi'an Meteorological Station and, at the same time, have the water conservancy agencies assist in promoting the establishment of rainfall stations. A resolution was passed approving the review opinions.</p>
<p>(B) Appointments and Removals</p>
<p>(1) Acting Minister Wang of Foreign Affairs submitted that Consul General Kuang Guanglin in Manila be relieved of his post for other appointments, and that Deng Zongying be appointed to fill the vacancy, with the rank of Minister. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>(2) Minister He of Military Affairs submitted that Yin Guangsheng, Chief of the Military Supplies Department of the 56th Division, had requested to resign and that Wu Jinzhai be appointed to fill the vacancy. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>(C) Matters for Discussion</p>
<p>(1) Minister Chen of Industries proposed that since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been extremely hot and without rain, causing drought and crop failure in various places. A drought relief plan has been drafted and should be implemented quickly. The resolution was: (1) Approved in general. The Executive Yuan will immediately organize a drought relief office, headed by the Minister of Industries, with the office located within the Ministry of Industries.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industries, in view of the severe drought in various places, has drafted drought prevention and relief measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review and implementation.

It may transfer civil servants from various agencies as necessary. (2) A special drought prevention fund of one million yuan is allocated, with 800,000 yuan used to purchase seeds for distribution to farmers, and 200,000 yuan for operating expenses, to be reported and reimbursed by the drought prevention agency. (3) The duties of the drought prevention agency are as follows: 1. Guide farmers in cultivating late-season crops with short growing periods (such as buckwheat, late corn, broad beans, and oil beans), and directly supply farmers with seeds to avoid delays and mishaps caused by provincial and county transfers. However, provincial and county governments should provide assistance at any time. 2. Investigate the actual situation in drought-stricken areas and provide farmers with practical guidance on methods such as water conservation and irrigation. 3. Plan and distribute winter crop seeds. 4. Supervise the establishment of emergency drought relief organizations in various counties. 5. Supervise the revitalization of water conservancy in various counties. 6. Regulate the supply and demand of food in disaster areas and stabilize food prices. 7. Prohibit people from using grain to brew alcohol. 8. Encourage farmers to plant more winter crops to supplement rice shortages. (4) The scope of work is limited to the provinces most severely affected by drought, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official of the Executive Yuan stated that the principles of the drought relief measures decided today are roughly: (1) Replanting late rice; (2) Selecting and planting miscellaneous grains. Both are methods of "losing at dawn and gaining at dusk." Seeds will be purchased and distributed by the government. The amount of funding needed by farmers will be decided at the meeting on Saturday, but it must be within the government's financial capacity. As for long-term solutions, standards will be set after considering the situation in various places. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The war zone issue has not yielded any concrete results because Huang has not come north and the Japanese have not shown any sincerity in negotiations, repeatedly making excuses and procrastinating.

According to reports, if the meeting can be realized in the future, the Japanese will first propose economic cooperation with North China as a prerequisite. They will not discuss other matters until a proper plan is obtained on the issue of economic cooperation. If we can accept their opinions on economic cooperation, we can begin to negotiate the abolition of the Tanggu Agreement and various issues in the war zone.

<h3 id="e24">On the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact: An Observation on its Future Based on the Locarno Treaties <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Since the Anglo-French Entente, international attention has focused on the establishment of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. However, the content of this pact has not yet been disclosed. Although there are claims of Anglo-Italian support, whether it will succeed still depends on negotiations between the parties involved. Therefore, predictions made today may not be accurate. However, as Britain, France, and other nations have named this pact the "Eastern European Locarno," its nature should have some similarities with the original Locarno Treaties. It is not difficult for us to glean some insights from the original treaties.</p>
<p>The Locarno Treaties refer to the treaties signed on October 16, 1925, by seven nations: Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. The content guaranteed the status quo of the Franco-German and Belgo-German borders as defined by the Treaty of Versailles, as well as their demilitarized zones. Furthermore, Germany, Belgium, and France agreed not to resort to military force against each other. If anyone intentionally violated the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, sanctions under Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant would be imposed. On the same day, France and Poland, and France and Czechoslovakia, each signed special mutual assistance pacts. The general idea was that if the peaceful arrangements made between Poland/Czechoslovakia and Germany were not respected or were subjected to armed aggression, the two parties would immediately assist each other. If the League of Nations could not restrain the act of violating the treaty, the two nations could act freely. Considering the nature of the two treaties as a whole, they greatly benefited France, Belgium, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, and the world viewed them as a major diplomatic victory for France. This was well-founded.</p>
<p>The key points of the Locarno Treaties are as described above. If we want to predict the nature of the Eastern European Locarno, we can use this as a reference. The planning of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact has been underway for several months. While Russia and France are the direct proponents, Hitler is the indirect facilitator. Since taking office, Hitler's foreign policy has been exceptionally aggressive. What has most alarmed France and frightened the Soviet Union is the Ten-Year Non-Aggression Pact between Germany and Poland, established this spring. After the establishment of this pact, the Franco-Polish alliance virtually dissolved. If Germany attacked France, France would lose a source of assistance. This is why France has had no choice but to court the Soviet Union as external support. As for the Soviet Union, already threatened by Japan in the East, it cannot but seek security on its Western borders. In recent months, there has been a common rumor in the international community that Germany and Poland, in addition to the non-aggression pact, have a secret agreement to jointly attack Russia. Once war breaks out between Japan and Russia, they will immediately invade the East. After the matter is settled, Poland would take Ukraine from Russia, and Germany would reclaim the Polish Corridor and part of Lithuania. Although this is just a rumor and should not be taken lightly, the Russians cannot but take precautions. In March of this year, the Soviet Union proposed to Germany that they jointly guarantee the neutrality of the Baltic states, intending to gauge Germany's true intentions. Who knew that it would be met with disdain and come to a halt. The hostile sentiment of the Germans towards Russia was further exposed. The Soviet Union then decided to ally with France to protect itself, and the establishment of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact became a common goal for the two nations. This is the reason for the Franco-Russian alliance. Even the current Anglo-French Entente has been influenced by Hitler's policies. This is well known to those who pay attention to the international situation.</p>
<p>By referencing the precedent of the Locarno Treaties, we know that the nature of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact will also be no more than a treaty to maintain the existing borders. What Locarno guaranteed were the borders between Germany and France, Germany and Belgium, Germany and Poland, and Germany and Czechoslovakia. What the Eastern European pact will guarantee should be the status quo of the borders between Germany and Russia, Poland and Russia, and Germany and the Baltic states. If it can be expanded, it may include the Little Entente, the Balkans, and Austria, Hungary, and Italy. This is not impossible.</p>
<p>Those who will enjoy the special benefits of this pact in the future will naturally be France and Russia. According to a report from Rome on the 14th, the draft of this pact stipulates that if France is attacked by Germany, the Soviet Union guarantees to help France. Conversely, if the Soviet Union is attacked by Germany, France guarantees to help Russia. This is no less than a Franco-Russian alliance.</p>
<p>It is predicted that the formation of this pact will maintain a small measure of stability in Europe. If a regional pact for the Mediterranean can also be established as desired, then the European situation may be greatly stabilized. As for the right and wrong of concluding this pact, the matter does not concern us and need not be discussed in detail. However, its benefits and harms affect not only Europe, but also the Far East, which cannot be ignored. After the September 18th Incident, the reason why the Japanese dared to disregard everything was because of the troubles in the international arena. If the European situation can be greatly stabilized, then Britain, France, and other nations will increase their attention to the Far East and confront Japan. However, based on the current situation, even if nations can unite based on temporary interests, they will inevitably have different dreams in the same bed. There are still many obstacles in the future of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, and we should not be overly optimistic.</p>

<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao, Yesterday, I read a news item in your newspaper's news column titled "Transport Workers Refuse Mediation, Wang Qi Returns to Beijing to Report," which contained the phrase "The Central Government, for the sake of mediation, dispatched Central Committee member Wang Qi to Yangzhou to persuade them." This is not consistent with the facts. Upon investigation, the boatmen and ship workers in Yang County's 12th Embankment have repeatedly come to Beijing to petition and have invited Qi to convey the intention of their requests, as 70-80% of the boatmen and ship workers in that port are from Hunan, and Qi is also participating in the Central People's Movement Committee, and is therefore responsible for mediation and suggesting relief. The opinions previously expressed by the ship workers and boatmen and Miao Qiujie, the Salt Transport Envoy of Lianghuai, were also quite close. Qi intended that, in order to peacefully resolve the matter and clarify the details, he would go to the 12th Embankment area of Yangzhou for personal investigation, and did not have a Central Government order to go and persuade. Fearing that this would cause misunderstandings among all parties, I am writing to request a correction. With all due respect, Wang Qi, July 17</p>

On that day, the Fukuoka Special Higher Police arrested two assassins: Wakisaka Toshinori, 27, the leader of the Patriotic Iron Blood Group, and Ueno Kensuke, 38, the head of the military department of the Japanese Righteousness Association. It is said that on June 28, 32 bombs were lost from a certain coal mine in the Kurate District of Fukuoka Prefecture. As a result of the investigation, it was discovered that they were stolen by Wakisaka and others, and Abe Naotoshi (27), an accomplice, had stolen 2,000 yen from his home and fled. Wakisaka has now been arrested and confessed that it was to be used as conspiracy funds. The incident is under strict investigation and will soon be fully revealed.

<p>(Shenyang) Yesterday, the 16th, at noon, a Japanese youth in the uniform of a youth training center suddenly appeared in front of the American Consulate General in Shenyang. He attempted to enter the office and took the wooden plaque in front of the consulate and struck Vice Consul Hall. Hall cried out for help, and the rioter scaled the wall and fled, but was arrested by a military police officer on patrol. As a result of the interrogation, it was determined that the perpetrator was Takuma Tsuchiyama (19 years old) from Kumamoto Prefecture. It was initially judged that he had a mental abnormality and this behavior was due to a flare-up. (17th, Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Naval Talks Aground: England, America and Japan Issue Simultaneous Statements; Suspension Until October <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office today issued a public statement declaring that the naval discussions between England, America and Japan are now exclusively concerned with procedural matters. Any further talks with Japan regarding other naval issues must be held around October, at which time the Japanese government will dispatch technical experts. Simultaneously, according to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo, the postponement of the London naval talks until October has stirred repercussions. A high-level naval conference convened today and passed a resolution insisting that the ship replacement procedures recently agreed upon should be implemented immediately. Furthermore, according to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, Secretary of State Hull declared that the suspension of the initial London naval talks does not signify a rupture. Davis is prepared to go to London again when the Japanese government plans to send representatives. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull declared today that the preliminary naval conference will reconvene in London this autumn, pending the readiness of Japanese representatives to participate in negotiations. This is the primary reason for the temporary adjournment. At this time, American policy will also be re-discussed with the government by its representative, Davis, who has been ordered to return to the United States from London within the week. In a meeting with reporters, Secretary of State Hull stated that Davis's participation in the talks in London, as well as future consultations with England and Japan, should not be regarded as a formal conference, but merely an exchange of views to serve as the basis for formal preparatory meetings. Only after the formal preparatory meetings have been held can a decision be made as to whether it is necessary to hold a naval disarmament conference next year. Hull did not express his opinion on whether it is possible to hold such a conference under the current international situation. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The naval conference preparatory talks held in London, after consultation between England, America, and Japan, decided to postpone the meeting until the end of October, etc. Details have been noted in previous telegrams. The British statement was issued in London today, and the Japanese Foreign Ministry simultaneously issued a statement with the same content at 11:30 a.m. Japan time, as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the procedural issues of next year's naval conference, Ambassador Matsudaira to England, British Foreign Secretary Simon, and American representative Davis have conferred. As for other matters discussed with the Japanese representatives, the Japanese government will dispatch specialists separately, and will not hold talks before the end of October.

<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador to the United States Saito visited Foreign Minister Hirota and Vice Minister Shigemitsu at the Foreign Ministry at 4:30 p.m. today, and described the circumstances of his safe return. He also reported in detail on the American sentiment towards Japan, with the Manchurian problem as its core, as well as the American public opinion on next year's disarmament conference, the policies of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, and various issues between Japan and the United States. He has made significant suggestions regarding Japanese-American diplomatic work. (Japan United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Saito, who returned to the country today, immediately went to Tokyo to visit Foreign Minister Hirota. Although the United States now acknowledges Japan's actions after the Manchurian Incident as unavoidable, it is unwilling to abandon its traditional Far Eastern policy and opposes Japan's demand to break the ratio system. It was clearly stated in the Hirota-Hull exchange of documents that Japan could propose adjustments in the relations between the two countries. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota's adoption of such measures, regardless of the outcome of next year's naval conference, is not without significance. Depending on the method, it may lead to the success of next year's conference. If the United States is open-minded and accepts Japan's proposal, Japan may put forward a new proposal. Therefore, Ambassador Saito's advice is extremely noteworthy. (Dentsu dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Yokohama Ambassador to the United States Saito, accompanied by his wife, daughter, and others, arrived here on the Chichibu Maru on the 17th afternoon. According to his remarks to reporters on board:</p>
<p>I left my country exactly three and a half years ago. When I last met with the American President, it was merely a farewell greeting and there was no special statement entrusted. I only heard about the formation of the Okada cabinet the day before I arrived in Honolulu. I was asked many questions by reporters in Honolulu, and I tried my best to explain that Japan's foreign policy would not change due to the change of the cabinet. Foreign Minister Hirota's criticisms in the United States are very good. Compared with my time as acting ambassador last year, American sentiment towards Japan has greatly improved. Regarding the Hirota-Hull exchange of letters, Secretary Hull originally intended to include more meaning in them, but that document seems to have had a great impact and can be regarded as the cornerstone of Japanese-American diplomatic relations, even if it is a laughing matter. Secondly, looking at the United States' attitude towards the disarmament conference, it seems that only its naval authorities have drawn up a draft, and it has not yet consulted with the State Department on its formal plan. As for the national relations between Japan and the United States, the Hirota-Hull exchange of letters is already sufficient. Treaties of non-aggression and non-war are really unnecessary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after a short stay in Tokyo, the ambassador plans to inspect "Manchukuo," and his return to the United States can be expected by October. (Japan United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) At yesterday's meeting of the highest naval leadership at the Naval Minister's residence, all strongly advocated withdrawal from unfavorable existing treaties as one of the fundamental policies of the Japanese Navy for the disarmament conference. However, according to this principle, the denunciation of the Washington Treaty must be notified before the end of December this year, the date on which its warning period expires. However, the Foreign Ministry believes that if the preparatory naval talks to be reopened in October do not achieve the expected results, or if the main conference has no hope of concluding a new treaty, it will not be too late to notify at that time. This view is not final. If there is a need for immediate notification, the Foreign Ministry will begin diplomatic work with England, America, and France, and then adopt decisive diplomatic measures.

<p>(London) The British government recently formally notified Germany and Poland that Britain supports the joint conclusion of a regional mutual assistance pact by Germany, the Soviet Union, the Baltic states, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc. Although the firm replies from the German and Polish governments have not yet been sent to London, it is generally believed that after the British ambassadors to Germany and Poland spoke separately on the previous two days, the British government has obtained more accurate information regarding the reservations raised by the German and Polish governments, especially the German government. According to Berlin, when British Ambassador to Germany Phipps first visited Foreign Minister Neurath last Friday, the German Foreign Minister had already raised some objections in his personal capacity. Phipps visited again the day before yesterday, and it is said that Neurath reiterated the objections he had expressed last time and raised a question, namely, whether de facto military equality is a prerequisite for Germany to join the mutual assistance pact, or whether it will be achieved after the pact is established. He urgently wants to know, but as far as Germany is concerned, it must follow the first method in order to support the mutual assistance pact. In addition, the German Foreign Minister also inquired about the extent to which Germany would be allowed to reorganize its army in order to conform to de facto equality. Because the German side has this kind of demand, the British Cabinet Disarmament Committee believes that the matter is important and suddenly convened a meeting on Downing Street this morning to discuss countermeasures. As for Poland, the general public seems to express some doubts, fearing that the Soviet Union will benefit the most after the mutual assistance pact is established, and the relationship between Russia and France will be greatly improved, while Poland will inevitably be overshadowed. Polish people also have doubts about the validity of the Soviet Union's guarantee. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Athens A Turkish soldier shot a British naval officer near the Greek island of Samos at the end of the week. According to a report released by the Ministry of the Navy today, the British 10,000-ton cruiser HMS Dauntless is currently cruising off the Greek island. The other day, Lieutenant Commander Robinson and Lieutenant Commander Monsell were sailing when they were shot by a Turkish sentry opposite the island. Lieutenant Commander Robinson was shot and fell into the sea and went missing. Lieutenant Commander Monsell was slightly injured. The Turkish bulletin stated that a Turkish customs officer saw three naked men landing on the beach from a sailboat and ordered them to stop, but they ignored him. The officer fired a shot into the air to warn them, but the three men still moved forward. The officer thought they must be smugglers, so he fired again. The Turkish government has instructed the Turkish ambassador in London to apologize to the British government. However, the Turkish government believes that the actions of the customs officer were completely legal. The British 10,000-ton cruiser HMS London has rushed to Samos for this case.

<p>After the San Francisco general strike began, the garrison here increased to 4,000 people, 2,000 of whom marched through the city. In addition to carrying machine guns, tanks equipped with one-pound cannons were also deployed, as if facing a formidable enemy. The provincial authorities also ordered the 160th Garrison Infantry of Los Angeles to surround the strike area. The team immediately carried 75mm cannons and headed to the strike area. Now traffic in San Francisco is completely cut off, and the bustling city has instantly turned into a ghost town. (United Press Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(New York) It was learned today that transportation workers on the Atlantic coast also have a tendency to respond to the dockworkers on the Pacific coast and go on strike. Government authorities and transportation companies are doing their best to avoid this danger and prevent the complete halt of foreign trade in the United States. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>According to New York newspapers regarding San Francisco, New York sailors will not stage a sympathy strike because their contracts are not due to expire until the end of September, and their leaders have stated that they will abide by the contracts. Almost all of California's seven National Guard units are now concentrated here. In addition, 2,600 more people arrived here at night, bringing five Walter tanks and machine gun and artillery units. After the troops arrived, they immediately built obstacles, and especially paid attention to the agricultural areas south of the city. All vehicles carrying food into the city are escorted by military police. Mayor Rossi declared that he had no intention of declaring martial law, and Washington officials also denied that local officials had formally requested help from the central army. Cities in the East Bay such as Oakland, Berkeley, and Alameda joined the general strike today. The Governor of California has reported this matter to President Roosevelt and discussed solutions with him. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>The San Francisco general strike began this morning, aiming to bring the entire territory of San Francisco, with a population of 1.3 million, to a standstill. The strikers are rushing to implement their plan, wanting to have the same strike in Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p>After the strike was realized here, riots broke out. 1,500 people robbed grocery stores, and a mob of about 50 people broke into the San Francisco Communist Party headquarters, moved out its equipment and set it on fire. Disturbances also occurred in Oakland, across from San Francisco. Police and rioters clashed, causing a lot of material damage, with several people injured on both sides. It is estimated that no less than 150,000 people are on strike, but the authorities are now taking various methods to prevent their actions from going off track. This is extremely difficult.</p>

<p>All industries throughout the city have stopped, streetcars have stopped, and only private vehicles travel on the road. The police are all double-posted to prevent attacks. An official from the dockworkers' union told a Reuters reporter that the workers were confident of victory and did not want any riots. In the past three days, the cost of riot insurance has tripled and is still rising, indicating the seriousness of the situation. A general strike has been proposed for Alabama yarn mills, and a truck drivers' strike will begin in Minneapolis tonight.</p>

<p>The labor unrest in San Francisco has caused prices to soar. Ham has jumped up by 12 cents per pound, and the price of cakes has tripled. The price of milk and butter is especially high. A few restaurants that have not yet closed have many people waiting outside, hoping to be seated in turn. Hotels now use paper for towels instead of cloth to avoid washing. The Central Food Commission issued a statement to reassure residents that there is no shortage of food, as wholesalers in the city have food worth 10 million yuan in stock.</p>

<p>The strikers have arranged their plans very carefully and have established 19 supply stations where workers and their families can purchase the food they need.

Hundreds of restaurants have closed, and the rest may soon close down as well. It is expected that milk will be delivered as usual, but bread and other items may be stopped. Stores limit the sale of sugar and eggs. The 18 restaurants designated by the strikers will remain open, so residents in the most commercial areas may not have to worry about going hungry.</p>

Although there were many pedestrians on the street, the usual sound of cars was silent.

Before the general strike, dockworkers, truckers, interior decorators, clerks, laundry workers, and streetcar workers, totaling 42,800 people, had already started the strike, totaling 106,800 people.

<p>(Washington) The government continues to take a non-interference attitude towards the general strike in San Francisco and the labor movement on the Pacific coast. According to the White House, President Roosevelt has no intention of landing in San Francisco to personally interfere. The Labor Department and the newly established National Labor Relations Board, although assisting the mediators appointed by the President, are also strictly neutral. This afternoon, the Labor Relations Board announced that it had sent Schoedonog to San Francisco for investigation. The Labor Department also stated that its mediator, Myers, will go to California, but these two have no other independent task other than to cooperate with the original mediator as much as possible. It is heard that Reconstruction Administration Director Johnson has flown from Portland to San Francisco to help resolve the labor unrest. The military has ordered the troops stationed in San Francisco not to take leave, but said that the movement of regular troops to curb the general strike has not been considered. Officials here received a telegram from San Francisco labor leaders saying that there is no danger of the people of San Francisco being hungry, so they don’t seem very panic.

<p>Seattle The labor movement on the Pacific Northwest coast is becoming more tense today and can be said to have reached the final decisive battle. Although there is no disturbance in Seattle, the workers are all ready to act. It is found that Seattle also had a general strike in 1919, the result of which was very bad. Since the San Francisco dockworkers' strike, it has been greatly affected since May. As for the situation in Portland, according to the news obtained here by the labor community, it will soon respond to San Francisco and implement a general strike. At present, although there is no general strike in other places besides San Francisco, the losses are shocking if the northwest coast is blocked for a long time. For example, logging, one of the main industries here, has now completely stopped, and thousands of workers are idle all day long. As for wheat, due to the drought in the west, there is a very severe shortage. Although it has been harvested here, it cannot be transported. Fresh fruits worth about 3 million yuan will spoil because they cannot be transported. Wool is also piled up in warehouses, waiting for prices to skyrocket. Gasoline in the Northwest is becoming increasingly scarce, and farmers need a lot of oil, so they are also greatly damaged. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>

<p>Since the San Francisco general strike has begun, the leaders, in view of the reason for the failure of the 1919 general strike being the loss of public sympathy, intend to require workers serving in public transportation agencies to resume work as a precautionary measure. This request was initiated by the Strike Strategy Committee, which is composed of 25 representatives selected from the Central Strike Committee. During the recent labor unrest, they have full authority to decide on any measures. Today, the chairman of the committee issued a resolution, expressing gratitude for the enthusiastic assistance of the transportation workers, and at the same time requesting that they immediately resume work. The general public regards this resolution as sufficient proof of the intention of the strike committee, which is not to disrupt urban life too much, so as not to lose the sympathy of the general public. However, the 2,500 employees of transportation agencies in San Francisco and Oakland are determined and continue to strike despite the above request. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>San Francisco strike leaders are cool-headed, and the stagnant situation here has loosened, and the tense atmosphere has eased. The news of riots received is not of a major nature. In order to win public sympathy and avoid bloodshed, the General Strike Committee has announced that it will never let people go hungry and ordered the highway pickets not to interfere with vehicles carrying food. Therefore, one of the greatest fears of the people has now been dispelled. The committee also expressed its opinion that it would allow more restaurants to operate as usual and notified streetcar workers to return to work. The post office announced today that mail will be collected and delivered as usual. At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, the government has entrusted the matter of mediating labor disputes to three mediators, namely, the Director of the National Labor Bureau, Wagner, negotiator Donohue, and Labor Department official Myers. All three of them have set off for San Francisco today.

<p>In San Francisco, where the labor unrest persists and human efforts have failed to resolve it, churches have widely opened for prayer meetings, seeking the benevolence of Heaven to restore industrial peace. However, the general strike commenced this morning at 8 AM, and is rapidly spreading. Café waiters and barbers, along with five hundred wireless radio operators, have joined the strike. The only ones who have not joined are the letterpress printers. The cessation of work by wireless radio operators is extremely significant to the shipping industry. According to federal law, passenger ships cannot sail without licensed wireless radio operators. As most of them are union members, they have no choice but to obey the union's orders. Streetcars and cargo trucks in the city have completely ceased operation. The National Guard has been increased to four thousand men. Violent acts are escalating in the East Bay area of San Francisco. Several cargo trucks loaded with food have been pushed into nearby ditches by strike pickets. Currently, officials are recruiting special police in Oakland, Berkeley, and Alameda to bolster the police force. (Havas Dispatch, 16th)</p>

Rooftops are crowded with onlookers watching tanks moving back and forth, the distribution of machine guns, and the patrol of seven thousand National Guard troops. Four streetcars, driven by non-strikers and protected by armed police, are running on the tracks. Officials are making every effort to maintain order in the city. (Reuters Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Shenyang Special Dispatch: The Japanese military authorities recently compelled the puppet government to implement conscription, starting in the southern part of puppet Fengtian Province. Villages are divided into three categories—A, B, and C—to determine the conscription quota. Category A villages, with over one hundred households, must provide eighty recruits; Category B villages, with over fifty households, must provide forty recruits; and Category C villages, with over twenty households, must provide twenty recruits. The conscription is based on one recruit per household. After conscription, all recruits are trained by Japanese instructors attached to the puppet gendarmerie headquarters. The Japanese are using this aggressive conscription method to prepare for a war with Russia. Currently, conscription has begun in Liaoyang, Liaozhong, Shenyang, and Xinmin counties. Recently, eighty young men were conscripted from Qianhutun village in southern Shenyang. The men, women, old, and young family members of the conscripted wept loudly, seeing them off with heartbreaking cries for over ten miles. The scene was unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>Changchun Special Dispatch: In order to expedite plans to attack Soviet Russia, the Japanese are expanding their plan to invade Inner Mongolia. Recently, the Japanese General Staff selected junior officers and soldiers from various divisions who are proficient in Chinese and familiar with the situation in the country, forming a brigade to participate in incitement work in Inner Mongolia. Simultaneously, ten airfields are being constructed in Liaoning, thirteen in Jilin, ten in Heilongjiang, and seven in Jehol as preparations for defense against Russia. These airfields were completed recently. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Panchen Lama's Return to Tibet: Will Travel to Qinghai via the Yikezhao League to Prepare for Return; Huang Musong Enters Tibet to Reconcile Factions <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Panchen Erdeni arrived in Beiping by plane yesterday (the 14th). After disembarking, he went directly to Fengze Garden in Zhonghai to rest. This morning (the 15th), the Panchen Lama issued the following statement: "I will stay in Beiping for about ten days. Currently, transportation on the Ping-Sui Railway is inconvenient due to the flooding in Pingdiquan. The train only goes to Pingdiquan, as the station was washed away. I will go to the Yikezhao League to chant scriptures after the flood subsides. I have decided to chant scriptures for a month. Regarding the issue of returning to Tibet, I met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, and all procedures have been agreed upon, but I cannot disclose them. There are also solutions to various issues concerning Tibetan internal affairs, diplomacy, religion, and education. The Central Government is extremely concerned about Tibet, so they instructed me to return. The main purpose of my return is to convey the Central Government's intentions to Tibet, so that there is no separation between Tibet and the Central Government, and between the Central Government and Tibet. The first step of my return route is to go to Qinghai via the Yikezhao League. I will stay in Qinghai for a considerable period. After Mr. Huang Musong enters Tibet, I will assess the actual situation and then decide the date of my return. Second, various preparations must be made for the return. The preparations will be finalized in Qinghai. Mr. Huang Musong often sends telegrams to me, and he is expected to arrive in Lhasa next month. As for the rumors that I will go to Bailing Temple, they are completely false. The youth opposition to autonomy is not a problem. I will not go to Bailing Temple because there is nothing for me to do there. If necessary, I will pray for rain while I am in Beiping. When I was in Nanjing, I went to Qixia Mountain to pray for rain, and it rained for two hours as a result. I will find a way to irrigate the drought-stricken counties of He and Luo. The only way is to pray for rain," and so on.</p>
<p>The Panchen Lama's bodyguard of one hundred and fifty men will arrive in Beiping tomorrow (the 16th). One of the bodyguards died of heatstroke in Nanjing. These one hundred-odd bodyguards will accompany the Panchen Lama when he goes to the Yikezhao League. The difficulty of returning to Tibet lies in the different attitudes of the Tibetan side towards welcoming or rejecting the Panchen Lama. Most lamas in the rear of Tibet welcome the Panchen Lama's return to the west, while the youth in the front of Tibet reject his return because of ideological differences. It is said that Huang Musong's entry into Tibet is to reconcile the opinions of the two factions. (15th)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Rivers in Hebei Province Overflow 丨 Yongding River Breaches 丨 <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: In recent weeks, heavy rainfall has occurred frequently in northern Hebei, causing all rivers and canals to fill up and overflow. The Provincial Construction Department has received reports of rising water levels in various rivers, except for the Yellow River, including the Daqing River, Zhulong River, Southern Grand Canal, Northern Grand Canal, Luan River, and Huanxiang River. Yutian County, in the third and fourth districts, reported flooding from the Huanxiang River, inundating over 40 villages and destroying over a thousand acres of crops. The Wei River, a tributary of the Northern Grand Canal, overflowed on the night of the 13th, flooding five villages east of Tianjin, including Yixingbu, Yangcun, and Huojiazicun. Residents fled to rooftops in the middle of the night, and countless livestock drowned. The 60 li stretch from Tianjin to Yangcun is a vast expanse of water, impassable by boat. The Yongding River's surge is particularly severe. Since the 7th of this month, the water level has reached over the bridges at Lugouqiao and Jianbaqiao, reaching a maximum of 63.38 meters. The upstream sections near Wen'an and Ba County are level with the banks, posing a critical threat. Men Zhenzhong, Director of the Yongding River Affairs Bureau, repeatedly telegraphed the Construction Department and the Yongding River Engineering Committee, requesting urgent funds for rescue to prevent flooding in the Wen'an and Ba County areas. In addition to instructing the River Affairs Bureau to take careful precautions, the Construction Department dispatched a commissioner with the remaining 29,000 yuan from the spring flood prevention funds to expedite flood control. Due to the rising river levels, the Construction Department ordered the staff of the Second Section, Dispatch Department, and Secretariat to work in shifts to avoid delays. On the night of the 13th, the Yongding River suddenly breached upstream. Dozens of villages near Qiajiadian were flooded with four to five feet of water. The flood was vast. The area, together with the Northern Grand Canal, has become a watery expanse. Over 4,000 acres of farmland were destroyed, and the flood continues to rise. The area is expected to be submerged further. The cause of the breach is that the Hai River Conservancy Commission, due to the heavy silt content of the Yongding River, which often causes problems for the Hai River during floods, diverted the river at Qiajiadian, above Beicang, to the low-lying areas north of Sanjiaodian, and built a control mechanism near Qiajiadian to regulate the flow. Recently, the flood overflowed in the Yubakou area north of Sanjiaodian, causing Xianzhuang, Dongxiaozhuang, and the Dingzhuang villages to become a watery expanse. At 5:00 PM on the 13th, villagers from Wangqinzhuang gathered at the control mechanism, demanding that the gatekeeper open the control gate to allow for drainage. The gatekeeper refused, and the villagers left dissatisfied. At midnight, a group of several hundred people gathered and destroyed the mouth of the old river channel. The local security team arrived after receiving the news, but it was too late. The dike collapsed, and the flood returned to the old channel, entering the Grand Canal. The Northern Grand Canal could not contain the water, and it overflowed onto the banks. Over fifty villages in the surrounding area were flooded. The flood was vast. The Hai River Conservancy Commission and the Construction Department's commissioner went to inspect the area today. Seeing that there was no way to prevent the flood, they decided to guide the river into the Grand Canal to mitigate the flood in the nearby area. The residents of the flooded areas are living on rooftops, and the Charity Association is rushing to provide relief. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Yongxin After Recovery: Former Specialties Generated Tens of Millions in Revenue; Population Loss Exceeded Hundreds of Thousands After the Calamity; Active Efforts Being Made in Rural Clearance and Post-Disaster Relief <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Yongxin County in western Jiangxi was formerly the lair of the Xiao bandits. After its recovery, it became a pivotal point for the National Army's suppression of bandits. Such is its importance. The area was recovered by the Western Route Army's Wang Dongyuan Division in January of this year. However, after years of devastation, it is difficult to restore its vitality. According to the on-site survey by the Western Route Headquarters' Yifu Brigade, the following is a summary:</p>
<h3 id="e99">Local Situation <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yongxin is located on the west bank of the Gan River, bordering Ji'an and Taihe to the east, Chaling, Hunan, to the west, Ninggang and Suichuan to the south, Lianhua to the northwest, and Anfu to the northeast. Although it is located in a remote border area, its water and land transportation is quite convenient. The He River originates from He Mountain, connecting to Lianhua upstream and reaching Ji'an downstream. In the past, boats traveled frequently, with sails like walls. The Badu River can also accommodate small boats and rafts, allowing for unimpeded transportation. The border area is surrounded by mountains. Yi Mountain in the east and Tian'eling in Taihe are remotely connected. He Mountain and Meihua Mountain in the west serve as the natural border with Chaling. In the south, Huangzhulun is connected to Qixilun in Ninggang. Shen Mountain and Xuhuang Mountain in the north are naturally steep, resembling another world. Therefore, the communist bandits occupied it as a nest for five or six years. Although it has been recovered by the National Army for several months, the area is exhausted, and the people are demoralized, awaiting active post-disaster relief.</p>
<h3 id="e100">After the Calamity <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Before Yongxin fell into the hands of the bandits, Xiaojiangshan, Badushan, Luofushan, and other places produced tens of thousands of dollars worth of timber annually. The mines in Tianhe and the iron factory boilers were worth millions of dollars annually. The lime from Shihuibiao to Shihui was a famous specialty. In total, the annual revenue reached tens of millions of dollars. As a result, commerce was prosperous, and schools were numerous. There were two middle schools, Hechuan and Vocational, five complete primary schools, and over two hundred elementary schools. The customs and sentiments of the people were slightly different from those in other places. Generally, the eastern villages were honest, the southern villages were lewd, the northern villages were simple and honest, and the western villages were strong and cunning. This is due to the formation of mountains and plains. The love of writing and vanity became common customs. Therefore, before communization, men of letters rose up. Since Zhu De and Mao Zedong sneaked into Jinggang Mountain in the 18th year of the Republic of China, they occupied it as a base and actively developed towards Yongxin, Ninggang, Lianhua, Chaling, Yixian, Exian, and Suichuan counties. The government's reach was too limited, so a spark turned into a prairie fire.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Extent of Damage <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>According to the statistics compiled by the county in the 17th year of the Republic of China, there were a total of 375,400 people. After falling into the hands of the bandits, approximately 50,000 to 60,000 people were killed by the communist bandits under the names of local bullies, corrupt officials, intellectuals, and reactionaries. No less than 30,000 people fled elsewhere. About 10,000 people died in other villages due to famine, disease, and epidemics. About 4,000 to 5,000 Yongxin refugees were killed after the fall of Ji'an. Approximately 10,000 people were killed after the bandits under the name of AB Corps. In total, the county lost more than 100,000 people. Over 5,000 buildings were burned down. There are no accurate statistics on property loss. At present, the ruins and debris are desolate, and the land is like an ancient battlefield. Recalling the scenes of the past, the descendants of Yongxin will never forget the Communist Party.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Rural Clearance and Post-Disaster Relief <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>When the Western Route Army recovered the county, it immediately ordered the organization of a Rural Clearance and Post-Disaster Relief Committee to handle various post-disaster relief efforts. The members of the committee were recommended by the Yongxin Fellow Villagers Association in the province to return and take charge. Their work is considered to be diligent. The first step was to handle surrenders and new beginnings. As of the end of June, 448 people from the eastern villages, 245 from the southern villages, 180 from the western villages, and 147 from the northern villages had registered. 497 certificates of new beginnings were issued. The second step was to organize pao and shen. 26 pao have been organized in the first district, 6 pao in the third district, over 30 pao in the fourth district, over 38 pao in the fifth district, and over 30 pao in the sixth district. The second and seventh districts have not been fully recovered. About 8,000 refugees fled, of whom over 420 have been accommodated. 600 refugees have been accommodated in the Litian Refugee Shelter. There have been 600-700 surrenders and captives. Since the recovery, the Jiangxi Provincial Relief Association has distributed over 20,000 yuan in relief funds, and the Western Route Army has distributed over 5,000 yuan. However, after the great devastation, a drop in the bucket is still difficult to provide universal relief.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Water Level Recedes in the Lower Reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong; Gongjia Turns from Danger to Safety <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Jitong Correspondence: Several days ago, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yellow River suddenly rose and flowed downstream. The river water within the province also increased by more than one meter, flowing rapidly. Gongjia, in the jurisdiction of Lijin County in the lower reaches of the province, has always been known as a dangerous section of the river. When the water level was at its highest the other day, a river beach collapsed violently, reaching the base of the levee. County Magistrate Ye Yunbiao immediately telegraphed the provincial government to report the situation. The provincial government ordered the River Affairs Bureau to quickly supervise the construction and rescue work. The River Affairs Bureau immediately ordered Liang Jinming, the chief of the downstream section, to personally inspect and supervise the repairs. Liang arrived at Gongjia on the 14th with Zhao Rongfu, who was responsible for the defense. Because the water level had receded and the collapse of the river beach had slowed down, the situation stabilized. In addition to ordering the section chief to continue throwing stones to protect the area, he requested that more sacks be issued for use. The River Affairs Bureau has already issued another 3,000 sacks. 400 of the 500 cubic meters of stone that were originally prepared have already been transported. Liang Jinming has been ordered not to return to Qinghe and to temporarily supervise the construction at Gongjia. The dangerous section should be safe. The provincial government ordered each county along the Yellow River to build a shelter every li on the levee, each shelter accommodating five people, to be reported by a deadline. This is to prepare for a major flood in the future, so that if there are not enough river defense soldiers, civilian laborers can be added to help, living in the shelters to avoid the wind and rain. The following is the telegram from Liang Jinming: "Zhang Junjian, Director of the Jinan River Affairs Bureau, Liang Jinming and others arrived at Gongjia this afternoon to inspect the dangerous section. Due to the strong water flow in the past few days, the river beach collapsed rapidly. The upper and middle sections now have a remaining width of seven to two or three zhang, and the narrowest head in the lower section has only eight or nine chi. Many hanging willows have been washed away. They are now being replanted. Fortunately, the water level has dropped significantly since yesterday, and the collapse has slowed down. The situation has stabilized. The stone material has been inspected and accepted by Councilor Ge. The section chief has been ordered to first load and throw sacks at the bottom of the lower section, and then use stone to protect it, so that it can be effective quickly. However, the sacks issued are not enough. Please issue 6,000 sacks to meet the urgent need. In addition, I met with the County Magistrate of Lijin at Gongjia to discuss the construction work, etc. He has agreed to send 200 people to help load the sacks. I plan to return to Qinghe tomorrow and report this by telegram. Liang Jinming bows his head." (16th)</p>

<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Shanxi-Suiyuan Military Reorganization Committee, in order to rectify military discipline and assess the academic and technical performance of various units, as well as the downsizing situation, has specifically decided to start the third year, second phase review and supervision training on the 15th of this month, with a deadline of the 25th. The Military Reorganization Committee has drafted a review and supervision training plan and assigned a colonel section chief, nine major general supervising officers, and two major general advisors, each with an attendant soldier. They will depart separately today and tomorrow. The committee also believes that due to the road construction duties of the various units, the implementation of education varies. Therefore, while dispatching personnel to supervise the review, they will also implement supervision training. The review and supervision training subjects will be in accordance with the scheduled review subjects of each unit, divided into academic subjects, technical subjects, and internal affairs, for detailed inspection. Special attention will be paid to military discipline. Units engaged in road construction and land reclamation are exempt from this review, but the supervision training of units engaged in road construction will focus on the current work situation, education level, and the quality of military discipline, and will be assessed in detail. Each regiment is expected to complete the supervision training in two days. The review and supervision training is divided into nine groups of infantry, one group of cavalry, and two groups of artillery, totaling twelve groups, according to the number of troops. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e105">Clearing of Bandits on the Jiangxi-Anhui Border Imminent: Loss of Base After Recovery of Yingxi <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence: The bandit gangs that have been disturbing the border between Qimen and Fuliang have been defeated by the joint attack and suppression of Chen Tiaoyuan's two battalions led by Li Tuan and Jiao Qu, and Liu Commissioner Xiao Xiu's district ten security brigade in Anhui Province. The remaining bandits fled to the Chengjiashan and Yingxi areas, attempting a final struggle. Recently, Jiao Battalion launched a fierce offensive, and Yingxi has been recovered. Over fifty bandits have been killed. With the loss of their new base, the bandits have been unable to succeed and have scattered. The Jingzhen Campaign Headquarters' Special Operations Detachment recently led the security regiments to enter and suppress the bandit lairs in Xinqiao, Jiaotan, Zhongshan, Songshukeng, and other places in Fuliang County, capturing over twenty people, including Tao Guangming, the chairman of the puppet Su District, and Zhang Huigang, the puppet regiment commander, and seizing a large number of rifles and school badges. In addition, over two hundred bandits in Liujiawan, Ezipao, and other places, over thirty li from Jingzhen, were severely suppressed by Zhang Battalion of the 55th Division and fled without a trace. Li Leifu, the deputy commander of the Jiangxi-Anhui border area stationed in Jingde by the Campaign Headquarters, arrived in Zhen with a battalion of guards and has contacted the various units, actively surrounding and suppressing the bandits. With attacks from all sides, it is difficult for the bandits to rise again. As for the scattered bandits in western Wuyuan, County Magistrate Liu personally led a team to clear the rural areas, uncovering several bandit nests. The coerced people have surrendered one after another. The large towns in the fifth district of the township, including Fuchun, Chongtian, Jiadao, Yanqian, Changxi, and Yantian, have been urged by District Chief Tan to organize civil corps to implement self-defense. The bandit forces will not grow stronger. With the advance and encirclement of the various bandit suppression troops, it is expected that they can be wiped out in the shortest possible time.

<h3 id="e106">Nanchang Discovers Blood-Touching Gang, Inspector Assaulted for Advising Against Bare Chest, Authorities Order Strict Investigation and Arrest <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Zhang Ke, an inspector of the Public Security Bureau of the Jiangxi provincial capital, was patrolling Desheng Road the other day when he saw a man with a bare chest. Given the strict ban against going shirtless, he stepped forward to advise him. Unexpectedly, the man remained calm and lightly touched Inspector Zhang's right flank. At first, Inspector Zhang was unaware, only feeling a slight chill. Later, while patrolling Zhongshan Road, he felt numbness and pain in his right flank. Zhang, skilled in martial arts and with some knowledge of bone-setting medicine, suspected something was amiss. He went to a famous bone-setter for treatment, who, after manipulation, caused him to vomit several mouthfuls of black blood, slightly alleviating his injury. Yesterday, Zhang reported the situation to Inspector Hua, who relayed it to the bureau chief. After hearing the report, Director Huang, considering the insidious harm of blood-touching injuries to society and the unwarranted assault on a police officer as extremely audacious, ordered all branch bureaus and detective teams to conduct a strict investigation and arrest to deter future incidents.

<h3 id="e107">Songjiang: Detailed Account of the Destruction of Songhui Amusement Park <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Songjiang has long lacked entertainment venues. Since the completion of the Songhui Road automobile road in past years, landowners with property along the road have built commercial houses in hopes of developing the market. Most notably, the Songjiang Dayue Theater was opened, showing movies and Peking opera, enjoying a prosperous business. Subsequently, Yin Shisheng, the manager of the automobile company, added buildings to the Songhui Xiaozhu, where cars were parked, decorating it with pavilions, terraces, and ponds. Part of it was used as his own residence, while the rest was developed into Songhui Amusement Park, featuring Shanghai opera, "four-hoang" opera, spoken drama, movies, and other variety acts for public entertainment. Tickets were priced at 320 wen. His wife, Shi Yaxiong, managed the operation. After its opening, citizens favored the park's open space as a place to cool off in the summer, attracting large crowds. However, Shi's supervision of ticket collection required even children brought by visitors to have tickets, and on Saturday nights, the park doubled its prices for fireworks performances, inevitably causing resentment among visitors. The brick-throwing that damaged the gate lights the other night was reportedly due to this. The First District Fire Brigade, at the park's opening, sent representatives to negotiate monthly donations, but Yin and Shi refused to acknowledge local donations. Despite the mediation of Yuan Da Silk's Jiang Zhucheng and Cheng Shujun, no agreement was reached. Members of the Songjiang Fire Brigade are all store employees who volunteer their services and work hard to put out fires. They gradually raise funds to replace fire-fighting equipment with pumps to increase efficiency. Regular expenses rely on monthly donations from shops and residents. Amusement parks are closely related to the fire brigade. Songjiang Grand Theater acknowledges monthly donations, but only Songhui Amusement Park refuses to donate. Therefore, the Fire Brigade announced it would gather every night on Songhui Road to test drive fire engines. The Yin family viewed this as a demonstration. On the evening of the 12th, when visitors were throwing bricks and damaging the park's doors and windows, three people were arrested by the police. The next morning, news of the incident appeared in the newspaper, provoking widespread indignation among the Fire Brigade. The Fire Brigade investigated the person who submitted the article, and visited the county magistrate to inquire if he had said the Fire Brigade had some kind of backing, but no information was obtained. Yesterday, the county magistrate invited representatives from the county government, various legal groups, and the Fire Brigade to discuss a resolution, and decided to suspend the test drives for two days to peacefully resolve the issue. The Fire Brigade agreed to accept this. According to a declaration issued by the Fire Brigade, the county magistrate was biased towards the Yin family and was undermining the Fire Brigade. They telegraphed the provincial chairman and the director of civil affairs, and telegraphed fire brigades in other cities to provide unanimous support. Last night, while the Fire Brigade was holding an emergency meeting, a report came that a tourist's head was injured by a flying stone at Songhui Amusement Park, triggering public outrage. The crowd rushed into the park, smashing doors, windows, equipment, and some cabinets in Manager Yin's residence. They then piled rattan chairs in the yard and set them on fire. The Fire Brigade immediately drove to the scene to put out the fire, and the county government also dispatched police to the scene to suppress the disturbance. Although the turmoil was temporarily brought to an end, the park suffered considerable losses. It is said that the county magistrate and the victim, Yin, have both reported to the province. The county chamber of commerce also telegraphed Chen, the provincial chairman in Zhenjiang, and Yu Wenyun, the director of civil affairs, stating that a dispute broke out at Songhui Amusement Park in Songjiang last night, and rioters took the opportunity to set a fire, which affected public safety and was a cause for concern. They requested that the county magistrate quickly maintain public order and handle the matter impartially, which would be fortunate for the region. The Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce respectfully announced. It is said that the owner of the park, Yin Shisheng, has filed a lawsuit with the prosecutor's office, listing more than ten defendants, but summons have not yet been issued. The dispute in this case may not be easily resolved in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Long-Awaited Light Rain Brings Joy <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Our city has been suffering from a prolonged drought for nearly a month, exacerbated by record-breaking heat for the past sixty years. As a result, rivers have dried up, farmland has cracked, farmers are filled with worry, and rice prices have risen to 13 yuan and 6 jiao, affecting all industries to a great extent. Local communities have voluntarily stopped slaughtering animals and set up altars at the Dongyang Taoist Temple to pray for rain, which had just ended yesterday. At 9:00 AM today, dark clouds suddenly gathered, and there was a very light rain. Then, at 10:30 AM, there was more light rain, which turned into a downpour at 11:00 AM, but only lasted for ten minutes before stopping. In the afternoon, the heat felt even more intense.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Suzhou: Three Major Panics in Suzhou City <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>During this severe drought in Suzhou City, not only have drinking water and food for the people become major problems, but also the canal water has dried up, and manure boats cannot pass through, making it difficult for manure collectors to work. In areas such as Guanqian Street, Zilan Lane, Daotang Lane, Gushi Lane, and Lindun Road, manure has not been collected for as long as four or five days in the worst cases. Most people are dumping manure in nearby toilets, filling the city with pits and gullies, and urine is everywhere, which is a great impediment to sanitation. Residents have repeatedly requested the county government and the sanitation association to find a solution. Some people have suggested that the government take over the manure collection and have the sanitation association hire manure collectors to collect manure from each household, collecting manure fees, and using the income, after expenses, to fund sanitation in each district. As for the drinking water problem, the drought prevention committee is using water pumps to pump water into the city at Louqi Gate and other places, transporting it by boat to supply people's needs. They are also releasing water from private artesian wells and building dams at Panxie and Fengmen gates to divert water from outside the city into the city for irrigation of the fields within the city. Regarding the food problem, yesterday (the 17th), the drought prevention committee decided that the county government should inform the rice industry association and relay to each shop not to raise rice prices any further. The grain storage committee will handle the grain storage issue. It was also decided that a letter should be sent from the county party headquarters to the provincial party headquarters to publicly sell the goods seized from traitors and use the proceeds to help with the drought relief. The county chamber of commerce is scheduled to convene a meeting this morning (the 18th) with leaders from the power plant, the rice industry, the silk reeling industry, and the electrical materials industry to discuss various important issues.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Wuxi County Government held its 21st administrative meeting, chaired by County Magistrate Yan, which resolved: 1. Regarding drought relief matters, the situation is urgent, and funds should be withdrawn according to regulations. In addition to using the remaining funds from silkworm rearing incentives and the agricultural promotion institute's previous allocations, 3,000 yuan each should be allocated from the industry and construction items. 2. The Construction Bureau is to order one 16-inch diameter water pump, one 12-inch diameter water pump, and two 10-inch diameter water pumps, totaling 1,415 yuan. 3. Since water pump engines are out of stock in all factories, it was decided to rent them from steamships. 4. The temporary measures for drought relief, dam construction, water pumping, and field irrigation were approved. 5. 200 dan of mung bean seeds, 100 dan of red bean seeds, and 40 dan of buckwheat seeds are to be purchased and distributed to various districts for planting. 6. Regarding the rescue of the city's water system, it was decided to set up wooden gates at the West Gate and the East Gate and set up machinery to pump water, which will still be handled by the First District Office, using 500 yuan of the previous police expenses for hiring workers to clean up accumulated manure. Toilet owners will be notified to clear it out within a specified time. County Magistrate Yan also noted that the first item listed in the implementation rules for the Jiangsu Construction Department's measures for drawing water from rivers and lakes to relieve drought relief, included the Lubu Port station, located in the northwest of Jiangyin, drawing water from the Yangtze River, which only benefits the northwest of Jiangyin and the northeast of Wujin. However, the three mouths of the Yellow Mountain Port, Yellow Field Port, and Xia Port in Wuxi County, through which the Yangtze River flows to the county's rivers, were not included in the station establishment and water drawing, which seemed to provide insufficient support for the irrigation of farmland in the southeastern part of Jiangyin County and the northeastern part of Wuxi County. In particular, the Yellow Field Port, which connects to the Xicheng Canal, is most important to both Wuxi and Cheng counties. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the Construction Department requesting that a station be established at the Yellow Field Port to draw water to benefit farmland. Regarding the Lu River mouth waterway, it is expected to be dredged by today and the dam will be removed immediately. The river channels in Furong Wei and other places are being dredged by villagers voluntarily. At 3:00 PM on the 16th, dark clouds gathered and thunder rumbled, making all the residents of the city rejoice, but with a clap of thunder, the roof ridge of the house of Zou Dehou Tang's Zou Laotai in the South Gate was struck and destroyed, without any rain, which caused great disappointment. However, Zengting, Xintang Bridge, Luoshe, Outang Bridge, and Nanqiao all received inches of rain one after another, but it was still not enough to make a difference. It is also heard that the county government has budgeted drought relief funds up to 10,000 yuan. Wuxi resident Gong Haiqin and others yesterday submitted a request to the county party headquarters to restrict rice prices to maintain the livelihood of the poor and prevent a famine.</p>

<p>Xinsutai Hotel on Mabian Road in our county, on the afternoon of the other day, a Shanghai traveler arrived, claiming to be Xing Jingyao, 30 years old. He immediately booked Room 14 on the second floor. That evening, he ordered the tea boy to mail a letter to a certain lady at the New China Hotel in Shanghai. It was not until 3:00 AM that he went to bed. However, until 10:00 AM yesterday, he had not gotten up. The tea boy was suspicious and pried open the door, only to find that Xing had stiffened on the bed, knowing that he had poisoned himself to death. He immediately reported to the front desk, who reported to Tu Zheng Xi Xuechang of the 13th Ward. The local branch sent prosecutor Shen to lead officials to inspect the scene. It was confirmed that he had committed suicide by taking opium. A diary and a letter from the Central Army Military Academy Training Class, Second Brigade, Sixteenth Team, signed Song Jieqian, were left behind and taken to the court for filing, awaiting relatives to claim the body.</p>

<p>The weather is severely dry, and rice prices have soared as a result. The price of white rice has suddenly risen in recent days to over 12 yuan, and coarse rice is also approaching 10 yuan, more than double what it was two months ago. Currently, the general populace is in a state of panic, and the authorities are trying to remedy the situation. According to news from Fushan, on the night of the 15th, 35 rice boats were exported, all loaded with large-sized rice boats, averaging 100 dan per boat, totaling as many as 3,500 shi, an alarming number. At a time when there is a food shortage, a large number of rice boats are being exported, which is related to the future of the county's food supply. Therefore, citizens of the area are requesting the county government to devise ways to prevent this to maintain the food supply.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department has specially dispatched engineers Chen Zhiding and Xu Qipeng to Changzhou to set up water pumping stations to alleviate the drought. After arriving in Changzhou, the two engineers met on the 16th with county government personnel and Irrigation Bureau engineer Zhang Wenbao to inspect the Ya River and the lake mouth, intending to use the power from the Qishu Weir Power Plant to pump water there. However, the plant's transmission lines only reach Niutang Bridge, which is three li away. They immediately discussed the matter with the power plant, and preparations are underway. There is also a need for pumps, which are not easy for the Construction Department to purchase. The Hou Sheng Ironworks in the county has more than ten pumps in stock, which they plan to purchase nearby. Various issues have been contacted with the Construction Department through long-distance telephone and are progressing. Wujin County has also been suffering from a prolonged drought and intense heat, eagerly hoping for rain. At 0:20 PM on the 16th, there was a sudden rain for twenty minutes, and again at around 4:00 PM in the evening, there was a heavy rain for thirty minutes. However, the total rainfall was less than one inch for both times. If there can be more continued heavy rainfall, there is still hope for saving the crops. There is also the issue of rice prices, which is of great importance to the people's food supply. The county government previously convened a meeting with rice merchants and limited the price to 10 yuan per dan. However, on the 14th and 15th, prices rose sharply again and have now exceeded 11 yuan, causing great panic among the poor.</p>

<p>Xu Tangsen, a native of our county, lived in the front of the school in the urban area. Now, due to high expenses, he moved from the city to Gan Qiao Town and taught for more than ten years. However, due to the educational economics being stretched thin in recent years, salaries have been in arrears for as long as three months. Xu Tangsen, feeling the pain of salary arrears on the one hand, and the pressure of debts on the other, took advantage of his family's lack of preparedness the other day and hanged himself. It is truly tragic.</p>

The villagers immediately tried to put out the fire, but because there had been no rain for a long time and the houses were dry, the fire spread rapidly, and firefighting was ineffective. It was not until 10:00 PM that the fire was extinguished. It is estimated that eight neighboring families, including Chen Dasanzi, were affected, with losses of more than 10,000 yuan. Zhaojiang's seven-year-old daughter was trapped and burned alive, which is also tragic.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 15th), outside the East Gate, near the Lu Gong Bridge, a young man in a Western suit, carrying a large and small leather bag, was pacing the riverbank and then jumped into the river to drown himself. He was spotted by passersby who rushed to drag him out. Several policemen from the Third Station happened to be passing by and came forward to comfort him. He finally stopped crying and took his belongings back into the city. The police followed him at a distance and saw the young man enter the Tong An Hotel on a small street, where he rented Room 38. They went inside and told the front desk. The front desk clerk was suspicious and went into the room to question him. The young man claimed to be from Sichuan, named Guo Lin, and had graduated from the University of Paris in France. After returning to China, he had worked as a secretary in the municipal government of a certain city in Yunnan. This time, he came to Shanghai and learned that his wife had died, which made him very unhappy. He heard that his friend Wang was working as a secretary in the Pinghu County Government, so he came to Pinghu to visit, but it was not the case. He also lost his leather bag on the boat, which contained money and important documents. He was overwhelmed with anger and despair, so he had thoughts of ending his life.

<p>The city had rain once on June 23, but after June 25, it was severely hot for days on end. There was some thunder in the afternoons of July 12 and 13, but until the day before yesterday, not a drop of rain had fallen, causing farmland in various villages to crack, seedlings to wither, and the autumn harvest to seem hopeless. The municipal government established a drought prevention committee, and various charitable organizations also set up altars to pray for rain, but despite the eager hope for rain, there was still no sign of it. It was not until noon yesterday that the sky began to cloud over, and at around 12:40 PM, it began to rain, but it only lasted for about an hour, so the long-awaited land was not fully soaked. However, the heat has noticeably decreased, and the epidemic may also hopefully subside slightly. According to an investigation of the rainfall and time yesterday, it varied in different places, with the central district of the concession being the largest. It started at 12:40 PM, only seeing a light drizzle, and then suddenly changed to a shower at 12:50 PM, which was quite rapid, but only lasted for more than ten minutes and then turned to a drizzle, intermittent, until it cleared completely at 2:00 PM, and the scorching sun spread across the land again, and the heat returned. The city and suburban districts were next, starting to rain at 12:45 PM and stopping after about forty minutes. The Zhabei area had rain at around 1:15 PM and stopped, and then continued at 1:45 PM, clearing up at 2:30 PM. Other areas such as Pudong, Lujiazui in the South City, and Xujiahui, Dianru, and Longhua had very little rainfall, only lasting for five or six minutes. Caojiadu and Beixinjing had no rain at all. After entering the evening, there was another shower at around 10:25 PM, similar to the daytime, but it only lasted for more than ten minutes and did not result in soaking rain. Therefore, the climate turned muggy, and the hospitals in the city saw a slight decrease in patients due to the temporary cooling after the rain.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the city has experienced a shortage of rainfall and the weather has been severely dry, which has not occurred in decades. The crops in the fields have withered. If we do not promptly seek relief, there will be no hope for an autumn harvest and people's food security will be at risk. It is understood that Song Ziliang, Director of the Dredging Bureau, has recognized this and has now decided to dispatch several engineers to transport two special pumps from the bureau to the Pudong area to draw water for urgent relief. It is estimated that each pump can draw 3,500 tons of water per hour, averaging 84,000 tons per day, which is a groundbreaking water pumping machine for Shanghai. It is also understood that Mr. Song specifically petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday to quickly dispatch workers to build dams, so that they can irrigate the farmland as soon as possible to comfort the farmers' hopes.</p>

<p>Due to the recent dry weather in the city, the Public Security Bureau, following the order of the municipal government, purchased water pumps and distributed them to various rural districts for use. Since there was no time to rush the process, in order to urgently relieve rural farmlands, the bureau specifically instructed Dong Jiaoyuan, a fire prevention section member of the Second Section, to urge the city's nine fire brigades to depart for the various rural districts to be responsible for pumping water the day before yesterday. It is understood that when the fire brigades went to various rural districts to pump water and irrigate crops the day before yesterday, the general farmers, upon seeing them, were all beaming with joy, and provided food and water to the firefighters. However, the areas in the various districts were vast, and the belts were deemed insufficient for use. Therefore, yesterday morning, several representatives from the various Zhabei fire brigade branches went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to petition for permission to purchase tens of thousands of feet of additional belts. The bureau has indicated that it is currently actively planning funding and will find a way to purchase them in the shortest amount of time. It is reported that the amount is in the tens of thousands of yuan, and the firefighters will continue to depart for the various rural districts to pump water today.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Gu Xinyi Discusses Reasons for Ordering Foreign Rice; Represents the Opinions of the Rice Industry <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that, recently, it was reported that the city's rice merchants, in view of the severe drought and disaster, plan to order 500,000 shi of foreign rice from foreign merchants to help stabilize rice prices. Mr. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the City's Bean and Rice Industry Association, issued the following statement to reporters from the Central News Agency:</p>
<h3 id="e130">This Year's Rise Is Rare <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Gu, in recent years, rice prices have plummeted, causing panic in the rural economy. However, recently, due to severe drought, the general public is deeply concerned that a major disaster will occur, so rice prices have risen. Although this happens every year at this time when the new harvest is not yet available, the rapid rise in prices this year is rare, which is unfavorable for the people's food supply, and the impact on farmers is also not insignificant. Therefore, the city's rice merchants have a proposal to purchase foreign rice to stabilize rice prices.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Yangon Rice Is Cheaper <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The rice merchants are now planning to order 500,000 shi of foreign rice from Yangon. China imports a large amount of foreign rice every year, mostly from Saigon. However, this year, India also suffered a disaster, so Saigon rice is being shipped to India for sale. However, Yangon should have surplus rice for export, and the price is cheaper. At current market prices, it is roughly around 10 yuan, which is about 2-3 yuan cheaper than the current price of rice in our country. Therefore, if this foreign rice is imported, rice prices can definitely be stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Extensive Drought Area <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Our reporter has learned that external sources do not believe China's existing rice reserves necessitate imports of foreign rice. Concerns have been raised that importing foreign rice could depress domestic rice prices, repeating past mistakes. When questioned, Mr. Gu stated that the drought-stricken area this year is very large, and even with thunderstorms during this hot season, it will be difficult to remedy. In past years with good harvests, large quantities of foreign rice were still imported, which undoubtedly greatly impacted domestic rice prices. However, rice merchants in this city currently plan to order no more than 500,000 shih of foreign rice, and they can reduce the quantity if it is deemed excessive. Therefore, it is not expected to have any significant impact on the domestic rice market.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Rice Industry Submits Request to the Executive Yuan for Approval <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Gu further stated that although rice merchants in this city have this plan, it still needs to be submitted to the central government for approval. The purpose of ordering foreign rice is solely to alleviate concerns about the future rice market. If a drought and famine unfortunately occur this year, not only will there be panic regarding the food supply in cities, but also rice riots in rural areas. Therefore, for the sake of the overall food supply and local security, it seems necessary to plan and take preventative measures as soon as possible. The Rice Industry Association of this city stated in its submission to the Executive Yuan that the purchase of foreign rice would be limited to 500,000 shih, with no private imports allowed. Furthermore, the sales and pricing will be comprehensively planned. The government will likely submit this matter to relevant departments for study, and then to the Civil Food Control Design Committee for planning. If the government deems this matter feasible, the rice industry in this city will immediately raise funds to purchase the rice to meet urgent needs.</p>

<p>The World News Agency reports that this year, various regions of our country have suffered severe droughts since the beginning of summer. The fields have turned into cracked earth, and the crops have withered and turned yellow, creating a desolate scene. As a result, rice prices in this city have soared, rising to over four yuan in just two or three weeks. Rice merchants have submitted a request to the government to waive import taxes and purchase large quantities of foreign rice in preparation for famine. Yesterday, news from the transportation industry revealed that after the success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, the active promotion of production has led to a surplus of agricultural and industrial products. Upon hearing of the sudden rise in rice prices in our country, they believed it was an opportunity not to be missed and are shipping large quantities of surplus Russian rice to China with the intention of dumping it. It is reported that the quantity is as high as hundreds of thousands of dan, and it has already set sail from Vladivostok to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive within a week. Rice merchants in this city have received this news, and rice prices are already showing a downward trend.</p>

<p>The Central News Agency reports that Mr. Sparck, an American businessman who has been engaged in the import business in China for a long time, believes that Chinese domestic goods are improving rapidly and are popular with foreigners. Therefore, he has raised funds to organize a company dedicated to promoting Chinese domestic goods. He has already collected over 150 varieties of high-quality Chinese domestic goods and is holding an exhibition at his company on the second floor of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation building, which has been praised by foreigners. Mr. Sparck and others believe that the demand for Chinese domestic goods is very high in Southeast Asia and other regions. Therefore, they have packed the goods and are scheduled to ship them to various ports in Southeast Asia this Friday on the President Cleveland of the Dollar Steamship Lines. From there, they will be distributed to India and other European and American countries for promotion.</p>

<p>According to the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, China's foreign trade is currently indirect, handled by foreign firms, which is inconvenient for both Chinese and foreign importers and exporters. Therefore, the bureau is vigorously promoting direct trade, which has gained the trust of foreign businesses. They often write to the bureau requesting the introduction of Chinese products for sale overseas. In order to develop foreign trade, the bureau immediately informs domestic goods manufacturers to contact them for promotion. In this time of market depression, it is urgent to open up overseas markets to help Chinese producers. The following is a description of the Chinese products that European and American importers are requesting to be introduced: Attwater &amp; Sons, a London company, plans to manage various novelties and fancy goods manufactured in China. Wallis Plaster Company needs sorghum stalks for certain manufacturing purposes. Export firms interested in trading with this company are requested to send quotations. An American glue company needs soybean flour. Siam Silmore Company needs electrical materials such as lampshades, light bulbs, fans, heaters, bakelite switches, and wall sockets. Trading firms interested in being entrusted with the management can contact the company directly. The address of the International Trade Bureau is on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs House.</p>

<p>The Kuomin News Agency reports that the goods carried by the Rokko Maru, which arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday, were all purchased after the implementation of the new tariff. The ship carried approximately 1,000 tons of sugar and approximately 3,500 tons of other goods such as yarn, cloth, cement, paper, seafood, and beer. The reason for the sudden increase in Japanese goods is entirely due to the implementation of the new tariff. In the future, domestic goods businesses will inevitably suffer a major blow.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Preparing to Dredge the Shentan Shoal, Dredging Vessels Will Arrive Soon, Sounding Work to Begin First <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the issue of dredging the Shentan Shoal at the mouth of the Yangtze River to facilitate navigation is being carried out by the Dredging Bureau in conjunction with the Hydrographic Survey Bureau. The Dredging Bureau has purchased dredging vessels from foreign companies, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. Therefore, it has consulted the Hydrographic Survey Bureau to conduct a sounding of the Shentan Shoal beforehand. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Current Situation of the Shentan Shoal <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Shentan Shoal is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, very close to the mouth of the Huangpu River. It is a necessary passage for ships entering and leaving. Because the mouth of the Yangtze River is located downstream, the water flow is relatively slow. Therefore, the water from the upstream carries sand downstream, which stagnates and accumulates here, increasing day by day. The Shentan Shoal is approximately 26 feet below the water surface. After being hit by wind and waves, the depth is only about 20 feet. As a result, ships with deeper drafts have great difficulty entering and leaving. The Dredging Bureau and the Hydrographic Survey Bureau, in view of this, have decided to dredge it to facilitate navigation.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Dredging Vessels Will Arrive Soon <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>After the dredging plan was decided, it was found that the work was difficult due to the Shentan Shoal being close to the sea and a vast expanse of water. In addition, there was a lack of dredging equipment. Therefore, two new-style dredging vessels were ordered from foreign companies two years ago, each worth approximately 2.5 million yuan. The vessels are custom-made, so it took a long time. It is reported that one of the vessels has been completed and will arrive in Shanghai soon. The Dredging Bureau will begin dredging as soon as the vessels arrive in Shanghai. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a sounding of the Shentan Shoal beforehand to facilitate the work.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Sounding Work Underway <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the sounding of the Shentan Shoal, the Dredging Bureau has recently consulted the Hydrographic Survey Bureau to handle it. Therefore, the Hydrographic Survey Bureau has been sending technicians on survey ships to the Shentan Shoal to place water gauges and conduct soundings. However, due to the strong winds and waves outside the Song Estuary in recent days, it is not easy to place the water gauges. Therefore, it has been decided to wait until the winds and waves subside slightly before proceeding. It is expected that after two sounding operations, a report will be submitted to the Dredging Bureau for dredging.</p>

<p>The Hydrographic Survey Bureau has issued a notice regarding the laying of a new submarine cable in the new waterway of Gaoqiao Sand at the mouth of the Yangtze River, Shanghai Port, to alert navigators. The location of the new submarine cable is in the lower section of Shanghai Port, 700 feet south of the Customs Explosives Warehouse Wharf on the right bank of Huangpu River, from 272 degrees true north to the left bank of the river, approximately 121 degrees 33 minutes east longitude and 31 degrees 19 minutes north latitude.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Representatives of Tobacco and Liquor Industries Petition the Chamber of Commerce Yesterday, Requesting License Tax to Be Collected According to Previous Rates, Willing to Suspend Business If Goals Are Not Met <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Chen Liangyu, Xu Yunxiang, Shen Weiting, Zhang Songji, representatives of the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association; Zhu Ligong, representatives of the Restaurant Association; Lan Qinghe, representatives of the Sauce and Liquor Association; Li Baogen, representatives of the Western Tobacco Association; Yang Qiaosheng, Liao Zhongwen, and over 50 other representatives of the Fenjiu Association, petitioned the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM due to concerns that the burden would increase after the license tax was transferred to the city government. They were received by Chairman Yu Zuoting and Secretary Yan Esheng. The representatives submitted a petition stating: "Regarding the petition, the associations were previously concerned that the collecting authorities would not be able to fully understand the special circumstances of Shanghai after the license tax was transferred to the city government, and that members would not be able to bear the burden if they were bound by departmental regulations. Therefore, the associations sent a letter to your chamber requesting protection, and it was reported to the municipal government, which sympathized with the difficulties of businesses. The associations also dispatched representatives to the Municipal Bureau of Finance to explain the special circumstances of Shanghai and the historical evolution, requesting Section Chief Wang to report to the Director, taking into consideration the situation of businesses, and to follow the usual practice of exchanging old licenses for new licenses. However, to this day, there has been no reply, and the number of old licenses for each store has been doubled, causing panic among the people. They have come to the association one after another, saying that each store is a small business and cannot bear such a heavy burden. Moreover, recently, housing prices have increased and foreign prices have soared. Even if taxes are paid as before, it is difficult to support. If the situation is further aggravated, they will inevitably close down one after another. Reluctantly, they have jointly elected representatives and submitted a petition, requesting your chamber to report to the mayor, taking into consideration the difficulties of businesses, and to allow the exchange of old licenses for new licenses as before. At the same time, they request the Municipal Bureau of Finance to temporarily ease the increase in tax rates to avoid disputes and ensure business operations. They will be extremely grateful." The petitioning representatives also explained the difficult business conditions, stating that they would be willing to suspend business if their concerns were not addressed. Chairman Yu Zuoting of the Chamber of Commerce comforted them, urging them to continue operating as usual and assuring them that the Chamber would submit the petition to the municipal government, urging them to sympathize with the difficulties of businesses and collect taxes as before. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that Wang Shouting, commander of the naval training fleet, previously traveled to Japan on the Ninghai cruiser. After the ship arrived in Japan, it entered the dock, where the Uraga Dock Company, which built the ship, carried out inspections and repairs. The repairs have now been completed, so Wang has left Japan on the ship to return home. According to sources from the headquarters of the First Fleet of the Navy, the Ninghai, on which Wang is traveling, may arrive in Shanghai today. Wang will rest for a day or two and then go to Nanjing to report to Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan.</p>

<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that since the Ministry of Finance issued the new tariff, the industrial and commercial circles in various regions believe that the tax rates for most imported goods have been reduced, while the taxes on domestic exports remain the same. They believe that this move will create an opportunity for the dumping of foreign goods. Therefore, they have repeatedly requested revisions. The Shanghai Mechanical Domestic Goods Factories Association held a meeting on the 9th of this month to discuss the matter and decided to send Ji Jiannan to Nanjing to petition the central government to reduce export taxes, refund raw material taxes, and revise import taxes, in order to provide a chance for the survival of domestic goods. However, Finance Minister Kong has expressed his opinion that reducing import taxes is a reciprocal condition and difficult to modify. Therefore, the association will temporarily suspend the petition and wait for the consensus of all manufacturers before making a request.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council Based on the Original Letter from the Jianghuai Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Sir, we have received a letter from the Jianghuai Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, stating that Yang Hailin, a fellow-provincial from Funing, reported that he lives at No. 5, Fulan Lane, Zha Pu Road, Hongkou, and is currently a recruiter for the Fourth Group of the Seventh Division of the Military Affairs Commission. He received a message asking him to return to Shanghai for leave and learned that on the 27th of the previous month, at 9:00 PM, his wife was enjoying the cool air at the entrance of the alley when she suddenly saw a rickshaw puller pulling a Japanese sailor. The sailor stopped in front of the Donghe Pavilion on this road without paying the rickshaw fare, and instead beat the rickshaw puller. Yang's wife told the rickshaw puller to escape quickly to avoid being injured. The sailor became angry at Yang's wife and accused her of assault, causing her to bleed and be seriously injured. Yang's wife cried for help. The sailor, seeing that he had caused trouble, fled north. Two Chinese and Western constables happened to pass by. Yang's wife complained to them, but three plainclothes Japanese men prevented her from speaking and dragged her south. The two constables, seeing this injustice, wanted to take the sailor and Yang's wife to the police station to resolve the matter, but the three Japanese men prevented them from doing so and shouted to beat them. The Western constable blew his whistle for help. The Japanese sailor forcibly took the Western constable and Yang's wife to the Japanese military headquarters. The Japanese took the Western constable's defensive handgun. Yang's wife escaped and reported the situation to the police station. The police station sent officers to the Japanese military headquarters to negotiate, but they were met by a large number of Japanese soldiers armed with guns. The police station sent Yang's wife to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Yang's wife was afraid of being retaliated against by the Japanese and dared not be hospitalized. She also had financial difficulties and could not afford medical treatment. Now Yang's wife is in pain all over her body, unable to sit or lie down, and in extreme danger. She requests negotiations." The association believes that Yang Hailin's wife was brutally beaten by the Japanese for speaking up to help a rickshaw puller, and the Western constable was also arrested and humiliated. The association believes that the residents of the settlement have no protection of their personal freedom and residential safety, which is extremely dangerous. The association requests the Council to investigate the situation and negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council to punish the perpetrators and compensate for medical expenses. The association believes that the safety of the residents of the International Settlement should be protected by the Council's police officers, which is an unavoidable responsibility under the current circumstances. Otherwise, there is no point in the residents paying for municipal expenses. Therefore, the association requests the Council to investigate the association's letter and take action as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Stetson Company of the United States, specializing in the manufacture of Paris garters, is world-renowned for women's and children's products. Mr. Larrowe, the company's foreign sales manager, arrived in Shanghai recently. Mr. Larrowe visited Shanghai a year ago during a world tour and was welcomed by the Shanghai business community. This time, he has returned as a result of the company's policy. The company believes that it is only by contacting people from all over the world from time to time that it can learn about their needs and improve its products. Mr. Larrowe believes that world commerce can only progress through cooperation and mutual understanding in all aspects. In his travels, the commercial situation is generally good. Mr. Larrowe told visitors that he was fortunate to be well-received by all sectors during his visit to China last year, and he is pleased to return to Shanghai. He exchanged views with prominent figures in the business community last year and benefited greatly. Since returning to the United States, various products of his company have made considerable progress. He believes that the special tightness of Paris garters should be introduced to people from all walks of life. Distributors are also actively purchasing in bulk, which is unexpected. He believes that as long as the products are excellent, the styles are new, and the prices are fair, there is no worry that they will not sell well. If honest advertising is continuously used to assist them, its power will be even greater. The company makes extensive use of pure, honest, and continuous advertising for this purpose, and the effect is very good. In addition, customers should be served with a spirit of service, so that the products will be improved. He hopes that people from all walks of life will not hesitate to provide guidance.</p>

<p>To broadly solicit and promote cultural exchange, Chairman Chiang of Nanchang specifically instructed the Southeast Five Provinces Joint Highway Bureau to organize the Southeast Five Provinces Transportation Exhibition, to widely collect works from young people and promote Southeast culture.  Following the order, Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Five Provinces Highway Bureau and concurrently Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, immediately began preparations.  This reporter from the *Shen Shi* newspaper met yesterday with Mr. Wang Yingbin, Secretary of the Department, who stated that after receiving the order, Director Zeng first organized a Solicitation of Young People's Literary and Art Works Committee to be responsible for handling the solicitation. After the committee was established in the spring of this year, it stipulated the solicitation methods: (1) Eligibility: Based on the literary and artistic creations of unknown young people in the country; (2) Solicitation materials: Divided into four categories: (A) Paintings, such as landscapes, etc.; (B) Western paintings, such as oil paintings, watercolors, etc.; (C) Literature, such as travel notes, articles, etc.; (D) Poetry; (3) All solicited literary and artistic works that pass the review of the Solicitation Committee will be issued a free travel pass, allowing them to freely travel throughout the five southeastern provinces to investigate cultural relics and scenery for writing various literary and artistic works to be displayed at the Transportation Exhibition; (4) Award method: All solicited works, after collection, will be evaluated by experts hired by the Exhibition. The first to fourth place winners in each of the above four categories will be given bonuses, with 300 yuan for first place, 200 yuan for second place, 100 yuan for third place, and 50 yuan for fourth place, as encouragement.

Currently, to arouse the interest of people from all walks of life in modern literary and artistic transportation, the collected works will be publicly exhibited at the YMCA in the Bāxiānqiáo area of this city on the 19th and 20th of this month before the general review by the conference. No admission tickets will be charged, and anyone can visit. Among the works are dozens of Chinese and Western paintings, all of which are outstanding works, and dozens of literary poems, representing the culmination of modern young people's creations, which are especially precious and valuable compared to any painting and calligraphy exhibition. It is thought that those who care about modern literary and artistic transportation will certainly want to see them first.</p>

<p>The Shanghai South Branch of the Municipal Tobacco and Opium Dealers Association previously received reports from members that they had been selling various medicines and quit-smoking pills. On the 14th, someone went to a shop to buy 'Ningbao Pills' and was immediately seized by police officers from the Second District, First Precinct, who considered them contraband. Nineteen businesses had people and pills confiscated and taken to the station. On the 15th, each was fined 10 yuan. It was found that the pills were sold by a certain pharmacy located in Baoxing Lane on Caishi Street in the French Concession. This loss should be borne by the pharmacy. In addition to notifying the pharmacy, the Association specifically notified its members, saying, "This is an urgent notice. Members who sell various quit-smoking drugs must be extremely careful. If they have not been inspected and approved by the government and do not have a certificate of permission to distribute from the Health Bureau, they must not be sold.

Unexpectedly, Lin Gen, not knowing how to swim, drowned instantly. The other children did not inform anyone at the time. Later, his father found out and rushed to the riverbank, where he saw his son floating on the surface. He immediately tried to pull him up and took him to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died.

<p>The Rénchāng Paint Shop, located at No. 295 Gōngpíng Road, Xīhuá Road, Gōng'an Lane, caught fire at 12:10 AM the night before, causing extensive damage and spreading to neighboring houses at No. 293 and No. 297. Five people, including Wèi Gēn Bǎo, were burned. After the incident, Chinese detective Shen Binkui and Yà Yǒnglè from the local police station went to investigate and learned that the fire was caused by Pǔ Shuǐjīn, a Suzhou apprentice hired by the shop owner, Yè Shēngxiáng, who discarded a cigarette butt near the paint materials before going to bed. The detectives believed that Pǔ was at fault and arrested him. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Lawyer Jiang Baolian from the police station explained the case and prosecuted him under Article 187, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Under questioning by Judge Huang Risheng, the defendant confessed that he had smoked a cigarette before going to bed, but did not know if it caused the fire.

<h3 id="e167">Fire on Tiantong'an Road, Zhabei, Yesterday Morning - Five Families in Xingyu Lane Suffer <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>A fire suddenly broke out at around 2:40 AM yesterday morning at the home of a certain family at No. 17 Xingyu Lane, Tiantong'an Road, Zhabei. At that time, all the residents were already asleep, so they did not notice the fire immediately. By the time neighbors caught sight of it and shouted for help, it had already broken through the roof, and the flames were soaring into the sky, making it impossible to approach. In addition, the weather was dry and arid, making the fire easy to spread. Therefore, it soon spread to the five neighboring houses at No. 16, No. 15, No. 14, No. 13, and No. 12. For a time, the raging flames soared, and the fire illuminated the sky. The residents were all awakened from their dreams, helping the elderly and carrying the young, fleeing for their lives in a chaotic and disorderly manner. The nearby roadside was blocked by boxes and luggage from the lane residents, and the shouts and cries were extremely noisy. Fortunately, the fire brigades in each section had received the alarm at this time and drove to the scene to provide assistance. At the same time, the Fifth District Office also dispatched a large number of long-term police officers to suppress the situation, and order was gradually restored. However, because the fire was aided by the wind, it was not easy to extinguish. The firefighters tried their best to prevent it from spreading, and bravely sprayed water until around 5:00 AM at dawn, when it was completely extinguished. As a result, in addition to half of the house at No. 12 being destroyed, the rest were turned to ashes, resulting in heavy losses. The arsonist at No. 17, where the fire started, fled after the fire broke out, so he was not arrested. At the same time, the cause of the fire is also unknown. However, according to a group of neighbors, it is feared that it was caused by catching insects in the mosquito net, leaving fire on the net. The police station is currently investigating and pursuing the arsonist, and will bring him to justice for interrogation.</p>

<p>An Englishman, Ah Baike (transliteration), 44 years old, employed by an oil company, resides in Room 23, Bīài sī Apartment, Fēnglù Road. On May 10th of this year, he met a Russian girl, Sha Gulov (transliteration), 16 years old (residing at No. 19307 Fèidé Road) at a friend's place. They exchanged affections and felt as if they had met too late. They lived together like a couple. Unexpectedly, before long, a storm arose in their love affair. Ah Baike immediately retained lawyer Huang Qiying to file a petition with the Second Special Court Mediation Tribunal, requesting to terminate the cohabitation relationship. The petition stated that when they met, they were in agreement with each other, and on May 20th, they went to a Russian church to hold a wedding ceremony. However, because the petitioner is of British nationality, it cannot be considered legal, and the opposing party also expressed understanding of this point. They were to complete the marriage ceremony at the British Consulate to make it legal. Subsequently, on June 8th, a marriage permit was obtained from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for the purpose of getting married at the British Consulate. Unexpectedly, the attitude of the opposing party suddenly changed, refusing to marry the petitioner and demanding to be separated from him. Her intentions are unpredictable, and they cannot continue to cohabit or cooperate as a family. The court approved the petition and summoned them yesterday morning. First, the petitioner's representative lawyer stated the reasons, and the opposing party was also represented by lawyer St. Cligolov, who said that since the opposing party met the petitioner, the petitioner often engaged in immoral behavior towards the opposing party and arbitrarily trampled on the opposing party. If you want to understand the real situation, please have the people in the audience leave so that the opposing party can confess. Now, in order to avoid his responsibility, the petitioner first came to the court to apply for mediation. Now the opposing party is preparing to file a complaint against the petitioner at the British Consulate. Judge Li Liang ruled that the mediation in this case was unsuccessful and instructed the petitioner to file a separate lawsuit.</p>

Later, the hospital notified her family to come to the scene and sent the body to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Five Male and Female Criminals Arrested in Drug-Induced Abduction Case - Incident Triggered by Hu Zhou Shi <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Hu Zhou Shi, 27 years old, the wife of Hu Yusheng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 68 Danfeng Road, Xinkaihe, Nanshi, is by nature fierce. In late April of this year, after having a quarrel with her husband, she left in a fit of anger. She walked to a vacant area in the French Concession, inside the Jiangbei Theatre, and stood there blankly, her eyes full of tears. At that time, Jiang Qiaoshi, a woman from Jiangbei, was watching the play and noticed Hu Zhou Shi looking flustered. She stepped forward to inquire and learned that she had left in anger after arguing with her husband. She took the opportunity to lure her and tricked Hu Zhou Shi into her home at No. 247, Lan Wei'ai Road, in the French Concession. Under the guise of comforting her in every possible way, she offered her a cup of tea. Hu Zhou Shi was thirsty and drank it immediately. Unexpectedly, she lost consciousness in an instant and fell asleep on the bed. Although she regained consciousness slightly the next day, her mind was still dizzy and she wanted to sleep. She slept for ten days in a row. During this period, Jiang Qiaoshi, along with Yang Jucai, Yang Gouda, Liu Guifang, and others, tried to sell Hu Zhou Shi for a price. Shen Baofa, a Pudong native who opened a leather suitcase shop at No. 707 Labosheng Road in West Shanghai, had a surplus of hundreds of yuan from his business during the Jing'an Temple incense festival on April 8th and was eager to marry a concubine. Shen and Yang Jucai, and others, were familiar with each other, so Yang and others acted as matchmakers and sold Hu Zhou Shi to Shen as a concubine, agreeing on a price of 80 yuan and a matchmaking fee of 20 yuan. At the beginning of last month, Jiang Qiaoshi, Yang Jucai, and others sent Hu Zhou Shi to Shen's place and signed an agreement. Shen paid the price and matchmaking fee in full and gave 3 yuan for the car fare. At that time, after Hu Zhou Shi entered the door, she was greatly favored by Shen, and they were very affectionate. However, good things do not last long, and her nature was difficult to change. Before a month had passed, she argued with Shen again. Later, she learned that she was a concubine and became furious. At the beginning of this month, she ran away from Shen behind his back and returned to her husband, Hu Yusheng. She reported the details of being deceived and sold one by one. Upon learning this, Hu was extremely angry. The afternoon before, he accompanied her to Shen's place to negotiate. The two sides were arguing and about to resort to violence when the West District Detective Team learned of it and arrested everyone at the Sixth District and went to the French Concession to arrest Jiang Qiaoshi, Qiao Daoren, Yang Jucai, Yang Gouda, and Liu Guifang. After interrogating them separately, Xing, a district official, determined that the case involved enticing a married woman and conspiring to sell her. He immediately prepared a document to send to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industrial Trust Corporation and the Municipal Ferry Management Office hosted reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city at Gaoqiao Seaside yesterday (the 17th) at 3 PM. Guests and hosts enjoyed themselves thoroughly, and each returned at dusk. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e174">Equipment on the Ferry <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Around 1 PM yesterday, reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers successively arrived at the bronze statue pier on the Bund, Nanjing Road. By 2 PM, all guests had assembled, totaling more than eighty people. They were hosted by Tan Boying, the manager of the corporation, and Chen Kecheng from the municipal government, and set sail on time. The ferry used yesterday was the No. 5 ferry, the newest type of ferryboat in the office, specially opened for the reporters. All the equipment was very clean, and the first and second class cabins were especially spacious and comfortable, with very good ventilation. The equipment in the special class was extremely magnificent, but there were not many seats. This type of ferryboat is specially designed for the general public, and there are relatively few special class passengers. However, the front and rear decks were very wide, filled with canvas chairs, and could accommodate hundreds of people. The floor was also very smooth and could be used for dancing. The ferry was equipped with a wireless radio, and elegant music played softly while the ferry was sailing. The sparkling waves and shadows of the clouds in the Huangpu River, and the clear and beautiful scenery, made the guests extremely happy. After an hour's journey, they arrived at Gaoqiao.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Seaside Tour <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>After arriving at Gaoqiao, they changed to a special car prepared by the corporation and drove for about fifteen minutes to the seaside. First, they took a short break at the Seaside Hotel and were served refreshments. Then, they went to the seaside one after another for sightseeing. The seaside had calm waters and bright sand, stretching as far as the eye could see. Reporters who were good at swimming changed their clothes and went to the sea one after another to try their skills, chasing the waves and floating. They were very interested. After everyone had been sightseeing at the seaside for a long time, they took a special car back to Gaoqiao Pier and boarded the special ferry back to Shanghai. The speech of Tan Boying, the manager of the corporation, to the reporters in the ferry is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Tan's Speech <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Tan Boying, the manager of the corporation, said, "Today, I am very honored to have the presence of reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers. I dare to offer a few words, and I hope you will give me your wise guidance. The municipal government's establishment of the municipal ferry was originally intended to facilitate the water transportation of the general public, not specifically for sightseeing purposes. Therefore, the equipment must be as complete as possible, and the ticket price must be as low as possible. We are working hard to improve every day. Fortunately, the results have been slightly noticeable in these few years. Gentlemen and ladies from all walks of life do not find the equipment on the ferry simple, and often take the ferry for excursions during their leisure time. The corporation adapts to the needs of society and operates evening cooling shifts in the summer. However, most of the passengers on the ferry are still travelers, and fewer are tourists. The corporation's greatest effort is still to adhere to the municipal government's intention and pay attention to the welfare of the general public. This is one aspect. The ferry equipment must not be too simple to ensure the safety of passengers. However, the prices of materials have soared recently, such as fuel and labor, which have increased day by day, and the ticket price cannot be increased to increase the burden on the public. According to the income of ordinary passengers, it is almost impossible to maintain. The corporation is determined to attract tourists to seek contributions. Fortunately, the municipal government is guiding from above, and the employees are working hard below. In these few years, although we have felt extremely difficult, we still have a small surplus, which is comforting to all sectors of society. Since the municipal ferry was ordered to be transferred to the Industrial Trust Corporation for management last autumn, it has been nearly October, and all matters have progressed rapidly. The number of passengers has also increased sharply compared to the past. There are facts to prove this. This is the second aspect. Recently, the citizens of this city have been quite aware of the benefits of suburban travel for physical and mental health. Therefore, on good days in spring and autumn, many ladies and gentlemen take ferries for excursions. Initially, Westerners accounted for the majority, about eight or nine out of ten. Now, our Chinese people also know the joy of suburban travel, and many bring their families, including the elderly, the weak, women, and children, who are also very fond of sea bathing or sunbathing on the beach. This shows that the general public has a deep understanding of the new life and is putting it into practice. This is the third aspect. What I have said above is just a humble opinion. You are leaders in the world of opinion, and I hope that you will provide guidance and correction at any time to promote the realization of the great Shanghai water transportation plan. I cannot be more grateful. Today's hospitality is simple and slow, and I am very ashamed."</p>
<h3 id="e177">Interrogation of Longhua Temple Property Infringement Case Held Again Yesterday - More Witnesses Need to Be Summoned <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Xingkong, the abbot of Longhua Temple, filed a lawsuit in the local court against the former abbot, Yuanzhao, and Hu Suji for conspiring to establish a contract to infringe on temple property, demanding confirmation that the mortgage management and rent collection contract signed by Yuanzhao and others was invalid. The trial has been held repeatedly without a conclusion. Yesterday, Judge Wang Run specially opened the First Court to continue the trial. On the plaintiff's side, lawyers Pan Zhensheng and Yuan Xilian attended; on the defendant's side, lawyers Sha Xunyi and Chen Wenzhao attended; lawyer Yao Wenshou, representative of the participant, and the plaintiff and defendant and witnesses, etc. According to Xingkong's confession, he is 72 years old and from Emei County, Sichuan. (Question) When did you come to the temple? (Answer) November of last year. (Question) What are you suing Yuanzhao and others for? (Answer) As the abbot of Longhua Temple, I have the responsibility to protect the temple property and to organize it one by one. Because I learned that Hu Suji was hired by Yuanzhao, and they conspired to embezzle the temple property, I filed this lawsuit. At this point in the confession, the official letter of the Shanghai Buddhist Association's appointment as abbot and a diary were presented to the court for inspection. The judge read them and returned them to the court. (Question) Why did you not receive the Wànnián register from Zhao Lingshao, a member of the Buddhist Association? (Answer) If I were to receive it from the Buddhist Association, I would have to use legal procedures, so I have not yet received it.

<p>Zhou Maoda, a local resident residing in a bungalow without a number on Hejian Road, is 40 years old. Recently, he has been unemployed and living off his savings at home, and his finances are extremely tight. His wife, Lou, often quarrels with him. At 10:15 AM the day before, his eleven-year-old daughter, Shi Bao, picked up a discarded slice of watermelon in front of the door and asked her father to cut off the dirt and eat it. Zhou Maoda used a fruit knife to scrape it, and Lou caught sight of it and scolded him loudly, saying, "You have no money to buy watermelon, so you pick up what other people throw away to eat!" Zhou became enraged out of shame and stabbed Lou once under her right breast with the knife. Lou was injured and fell to the ground, crying out in pain. A neighbor woman flew to report it to the No. 15 Indian policeman on duty nearby, who arrested him and took him, along with the murder weapon, to the Yangshupu Police Station. Zhou's attorney, Li Zhishan, from the 工部局 (Public Works Department), yesterday morning stated to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court that, according to the victim, the defendant did not do business and often pawned his clothes for money, while the defendant accused her of being unchaste and often returning home late at night. The victim is currently in the hospital with serious injuries, and the knife has pierced her lung, and requested an extension. He presented the injury certificate and the murder weapon for inspection. Judge Liu Yugui ordered that he be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days later.</p>

<p>Chen San, a sawyer hired by Hengshunxing Wood Shop at Dingshui Bridge, Yangjing Town, Pudong, was a native of Nanhui and was 32 years old. At around 4 PM the day before, Chen San and his companions were working under the awning. Because of the hot weather, they pooled their money to buy a watermelon, which they cut open and shared. After eating it, they were still chatting about how delicious the watermelon was. Unexpectedly, before a moment had passed, Chen vomited blood, fell to the ground, and barely had any breath. Jia Shanshan, the owner of Hengshunxing Wood Shop, saw it and was greatly shocked. Just as he was about to find a way to treat him, it was too late, and he died.

<p>Mao Mingxing, also known as Mao Wenxing, a native of Fenghua, Ningbo, 35 years old, is a notorious bandit leader in the area with a long list of crimes. The local government has been strictly pursuing him without success and has offered a reward of 200 yuan. Recently, Mao gathered his accomplices again and kidnapped Mao Yuqing, a wealthy household in Shimen Song Village, Fenghua, on April 30, demanding a huge ransom. The security team searched everywhere and, on June 20, learned where Mao was hiding. They sent a team to suppress him. The two sides exchanged fire, and as a result, Mao was shot in the head and retreated in defeat. Mao also fled to Shanghai to seek refuge at No. 30, Shi De Lane, Maigen Road. Wu Zhenyuan, the leader of the侦缉 (detective) team of the Fenghua Public Security Bureau, learned of this, and led a number of detectives to Shanghai with documents. At 11:00 AM the day before, they joined forces with Inspector Lu Liankui, detective Feng Zhiming, and detective Chen Yonggui from the general inspection office of the Public Concession Police to secretly arrest Mao and bring him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Gan Jingxian, the police attorney, stated the facts of the case and expressed agreement with the request for transfer. After Judge Qian Hongye questioned Mao, Mao confessed without denial. Judge Qian then granted the request of the officials from the Fenghua Public Security Bureau and handed Mao over to the officials to be brought back for interrogation. However, the hostage, Mao Yuqing, has not yet been rescued. Now that Mao has been arrested, he may be able to reveal the location where the hostage is being held and rescue him.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Concession Rickshaw Merchants Petitioned Yesterday Without Result <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department believes that rickshaw owners charge rickshaw pullers 14 dimes per day for rickshaw rental, and there are head foremen and contractors who additionally demand extra money from them. This causes the average rickshaw puller, even after selling his labor all day long, to have difficulty making ends meet. Therefore, a Rickshaw Committee was established to improve the treatment of rickshaw pullers and decided to reduce the daily rental to 10 dimes starting from August 1, and to 8 dimes next year, to show relief. The rickshaw merchants in the Concession specially sent representatives Yin Zhiling and Hou Shaoan and two others to petition yesterday. It is reported that there was no result.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Public Works Department Commences Organizing the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Management Department of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society, initiated by the Public Works Department, was established on the 13th of this month. The Public Works Department appointed Messrs. Massey, Zhu Maocheng, and Wang Zhiren as fund committee members. Later, the committee members invited Dr. Li Denghui (President of Fudan University), Miss J. B. Perkins (Secretary of the Women's Federation Committee), Mr. R. R. Service (Secretary of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association), Mr. Laurence Todnem (American Bible Society), Mr. Ying Shugui (Accountant of the Shanghai YMCA), and Mr. Qiu Zitong (Secretary of the Yangshupu Social Center) to form a management department. At the meeting that day, Mr. Massey presided and reported that the purpose of the society is purely for the welfare of public rickshaw pullers, and it is based on the self-reliance and mutual assistance of the rickshaw pullers. As for the society's expenses, each rickshaw puller will donate one dime per day. This amount will be collected by the rickshaw owners, who will then pay one dollar and fifty cents per rickshaw per month to the society. As for the rickshaw pullers' burden of one dime, it will not be difficult because, since August 1, the Public Works Department has stipulated that the rickshaw rental is 10 dimes per day, adding this one dime, it totals 11 dimes, which is less than the current rental of 14 dimes. Subsequently, the committee members discussed the implementation methods and decided to first select Messrs. Service, Qiu Zitong, and Zhu Maocheng to form a small committee to study the implementation procedures and submit a report at the second meeting on the 27th of this month. The committee members of the management department may be supplemented with other people in the future.</p>

By the time the prayer ended and they withdrew, a heavy rain fell, stopping after about half an hour, and then the sky cleared up immediately. The society, because the rain was heavy but not continuous, will continue to pray until the farmers and laborers can proceed with their work.</p>

Her appearance is still beautiful. At that time, Zhang Damao paid a betrothal gift of 120 yuan. Chen sent the woman to Song to pass through the door a week ago. Damao also held a grand banquet to entertain relatives and friends. After entering the room that night, Damao wanted to enjoy the pleasure of the boudoir with Yunlang, but Yunlang's Taoyuan was actually asking for directions at the crossing. Damao asked what was going on, but Yunlang was shy and did not answer. After Damao spent several days asking questions, he learned that she was a stone woman. Damao believed that the woman's development was not complete, and yesterday he contacted the original matchmaker to invite Chen's father to Song to negotiate and return the woman. After mediation, the Chen family compensated Zhang Damao 100 yuan, and Yunlang was taken back by the Chen family.</p>

<p>▲New Initiatives of the Shanghai National Products Company: The Shanghai National Products Company, located opposite the Hong Miao Temple on Nanjing Road in this city, is the earliest established and most fully equipped national products company on Nanjing Road.

<p>▲Revival of Ancient Night Blooming Flower Powder: According to a recent report from the Customs, imported cosmetics entering China each month amount to hundreds of thousands, a truly alarming figure. Mr. Ma Jisheng, Chairman of the Cosmetics Trade Association in this city, has extensive experience in the manufacturing of cosmetics. To promote domestically produced cosmetics and reclaim rights, he has specially cultivated several tens of acres of land, planted night-blooming cereus, collected seeds to extract powder, and used scientific methods to refine it carefully, producing Night Blooming Flower Seed Scented Powder.

It is reported that the company has urgently requested the United States to quickly ship a large batch of radios to meet the emergency needs in order to facilitate patronage. It is also reported that the "Zenith" radio can indeed receive sounds broadcast from major cities across the country and abroad, which is much more perfect than other radios.

<p>▲Launch of Fresh Fruit Essence: The Sino-Western Pharmacy on Four Horse Road has recently launched a type of Fresh Fruit Essence.

The bottles are exquisitely designed in a flower basket style, and each bottle is sold for only 50 cents. Because of the hot weather, the pharmacy has recently reduced the price of Godly Efficacy Merit Water to one dollar less per dozen, Emergency Preservation Water to nine cents less per forty bottles, and Pharmaceutical Brandy to twenty bottles for two dollars.

<p>▲Price Increase for China and Other Coal Balls: Various coal ball factories in this city, such as China, China National, Nanyang, Guohua, and Huacheng, are now facing skyrocketing raw material prices and are unable to cover the high costs.

<h3 id="e209">Reading Q&amp;A Several Questions about Books 丨Answer to Mr. Ye Guobin丨 <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>Since joining your department, I have been eager to purchase and read the book you recommended to me, "Basic Knowledge of Social Sciences." After reading it, I have several questions, listed below, and I would appreciate your guidance.</p>
<p>1.  In the section on social sciences in the first chapter, it states, "Social phenomena are conscious, while natural phenomena are unconscious. Social phenomena are purposeful, while natural phenomena are aimless. The labor of social phenomena and the labor of natural phenomena differ in form: the special form of labor in social phenomena is the use and creation of labor tools, which is a characteristic of humans, whereas most natural phenomena do not engage in natural labor, and even when they do, the form of their labor is different from the form of labor in social phenomena." Which natural phenomena do not engage in labor? Which ones do? I really don't understand.</p>
<p>2.  This book only mentions social sciences and natural sciences. I don't know if philosophy and literature belong to social sciences. Can the term "philosophical science" be opposed to the terms "social science" and "natural science," or is it contained within social science?</p>
<p>3.  The third chapter, "Social Thought," describes theories such as socialism, anarchism, and nationalism, each with its own merits. I don't know which one is more viable and beneficial to humanity. How can one distinguish between the good and bad of these social thoughts so as not to be misled by incorrect ideas?</p>
<p>4.  Is there a difference between social thought and political thought?</p>
<p>The above are my questions after reading the book "Basic Knowledge of Social Sciences." However, what I am most dissatisfied with is that although this book tells me the content of social sciences, it is biased towards objective narration, leaving me unsure which social thought is correct and can be implemented for the benefit of the masses, and which social movement is most effective. Also, there are too many typos. (Rest omitted)</p>
<p>丨Letter from Ye Guobin</p>
<p>Answer 1: Natural phenomena can be divided into biological phenomena and non-biological phenomena. Biological phenomena, such as the lives of animals, require labor because animals must use their own labor to seek or capture food. Non-biological things do not need nutrients, so they do not need to labor. Although plants need nutrients, their nutrients are obtained entirely from readily available sources and do not require them to move their bodies, so there is little labor involved. Although the lives of animals depend on labor, their labor is entirely based on their own physiological structure. For example, tigers and leopards can only use claws and teeth, cattle and horses can only use horns and hooves, and elephants can only use their trunks. Therefore, it is unconscious. Humans, on the other hand, can create tools independently of their physiological structure, i.e., they can change the shape of external objects according to their own needs to suit their own needs. Therefore, it is purposeful and conscious.</p>
<p>Answer 2: Generally, when science is mentioned, it only refers to natural sciences and social sciences. Philosophy and literature are not included. But in reality, it cannot be divided so strictly. For example, although literature does not belong to any science in terms of creation, it must be studied as part of social science in terms of theory. Philosophy stands in a comprehensive position with regard to science. The content of philosophy is the common and general laws of social science and natural science. Therefore, philosophy can be said to be neither social science nor natural science, but it has a close relationship with both. When studying knowledge, one must not divide the various departments of knowledge too strictly and should pay attention to the interconnections of the various sciences in order not to be limited by narrow concepts.</p>
<p>Answer 3: Regarding the pros and cons of various doctrines, we cannot stand on a subjective position and casually answer readers, because the purpose of reading is for readers to be able to judge for themselves. As for telling readers how to distinguish between good and bad, that is possible. What are good and viable doctrines? It must be a doctrine based on scientific theory. What theory is scientific? We cannot seek the answer to this question solely in books; we must also verify it in the facts of real society. If a theory is not one-sided, exaggerated, or deceptive, but can expose the most real essence of objective facts, then everything stated by this theory must be correct, and the actions of human beings based on this theory will also be the most progressive and effective. Using these two points as standards, we can very well judge the good and bad of a doctrine. Therefore, to be able to judge accurately, one must also have some experience; one cannot immediately obtain a complete conclusion from books. Books only help us in one aspect, that is, providing some knowledge. There is absolutely no real encyclopedia in the world...</p>
<p>Answer 4: Political thought is a part of social thought.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Letter from the Editor: The Shen Shi Telegraphic News Agency Over the Past Decade: Past Developments <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>There are three modern tools for international competition: military affairs, economy, and propaganda. Propaganda is the vanguard in various battles around the world. Great powers devote tireless effort in organizing and managing these. The most important and successful among them are telegraphic news agencies, which are large in scale and tightly organized. Examples include Reuters in England, United Press in America, Havas in France, TASS in Russia, and Dentsu in Japan. Their capital often reaches millions, and their communication networks span the globe. Therefore, they can send a message in the morning and have it spread to all nations by evening. Their power is strong, and the results are magnificent. Since the beginning of journalism in our country, due to weak economic strength and lack of transportation, there has been no such organization. Every time there are international negotiations, we are deceived by the enemy and cannot obtain the support of correct world public opinion, leading to repeated failures in diplomacy. Furthermore, domestic newspapers, due to the lack of assistance from telegraphic news agencies, have difficulty covering events thoroughly and are slow to receive news. Important news such as political, military, and economic news is monopolized by foreign communication agencies, which distort the truth, divide national unity. Not only is it difficult to expect long-term progress, but they are also declining day by day, with no vitality. The harm they inflict on our country and nation is no less than military and economic aggression.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, a few people in Shanghai's newspaper industry, aware of this, contacted colleagues from the editorial departments of the Shen Bao and Shi Shi Xin Bao. During their spare time, they extracted and translated special dispatches from various sources obtained by the two newspapers and telegraphed them to several related newspapers in other cities, aiming to transmit accurate news in a swift manner, assist the development of newspapers in various regions, and correct the views of people from all walks of life. This was the beginning of the "China Times Telegraphic News Agency."</p>
<p>After several years of trial operation, they were deeply appreciated by newspapers in various regions, and the number of newspapers entrusting them to send telegrams increased daily. Colleagues from the two newspapers found it difficult to manage both. Therefore, in 1928, they defined the organization, expanded capital, and hired full-time staff to compile and send Chinese and English telegrams separately. The foundation of the news agency was thus laid, and the name "Shen Shi" began to be recognized by society. The news telegraphic agency operated by Chinese people has used "Shen Shi" as its beginning since then. Responding to social needs and based on the spirit of service, they gradually expanded, and business became prosperous. Chinese people gradually understood that the telegraphic news agency has a close relationship with the country and the nation. In order to develop their businesses, newspapers have paid more attention to telegraphic news agencies. The work of "Shen Shi" has been increasingly supported by all parties and has made rapid progress.</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the work of "Shen Shi" has suddenly become tense as it followed the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. At that time, several special military reporters from "Shen Shi" braved dangers and went to the war zone to investigate the military situation on both sides, entering and exiting the hail of bullets. Although they were often in danger, they never flinched. Internal editors worked around the clock and were often stationed at the news agency, and as soon as intelligence from the front lines arrived, they immediately compiled and sent it to newspapers in various regions. Therefore, the news obtained by "Shen Shi" was more detailed and accurate than that of foreign telegraphic agencies, and the telegrams sent were the fastest, winning great praise from all parties and regaining the hard-won honor of China's telegraphic industry. Newspapers in various regions requesting "Shen Shi" to supply telegrams have flocked in ever since. The original staff in the news agency was insufficient, so in that summer, the news agency expanded internally and hired more staff, and business has progressed even further. To date, the number of newspapers that have formally contracted with "Shen Shi" to supply telegrams, both domestically and abroad, has reached more than one hundred. Domestically, the locations include Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Nanchang, Hankou, Changsha, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Jinan, Yantai, Tianjin, Beiping, Kaifeng, Xi'an, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and other places. Abroad, the locations include Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, Java, and Honolulu. More than thirty special correspondents are stationed in various important cities. On average, more than 60,000 words are received and sent daily. Furthermore, the special telegrams received daily by the Shi Shi Xin Bao, Da Lu Bao, and Da Wan Bao are used by "Shen Shi" to the greatest extent. Therefore, "Shen Shi" is nothing less than a general collection of political, military, economic, educational, industrial, and social news from all over the country.</p>
<p>The work of "Shen Shi" originally focused on telegraphic news, aiming to compete with foreign telegraphic news agencies. However, it also paid great attention to lengthy correspondence from home and abroad, hoping to supplement the insufficiency of telegraphic news with systematic narration. All specially contracted correspondents have been deployed in almost all important cities, and correspondents in various remote provinces have been hired to send important news from the frontiers. Travel reporters have been repeatedly dispatched to inspect the northeastern and northwestern provinces and the Yangtze and Pearl River basins, collecting news related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. When the Fujian Incident occurred, personnel were sent to fly to Guangdong, Fujian, and the Zhejiang border to inspect the truth. When internal disputes often arose in Xinjiang, special personnel were contracted to enter Xinjiang from Baotou and Suiyuan to conduct on-the-spot investigations. Recently, personnel were sent to the bandit areas in Jiangxi Province to produce accurate accounts. The local news coverage in Shanghai focuses on political facilities, diplomatic transformations, the rise and fall of urban finance and rural economy, the movement of social consciousness and people's livelihood patterns, adhering to the principle of emphasizing quality over quantity, and rejecting rumors. In addition, photography and plate-making departments were added to create vivid descriptions of current affairs issues. In response to requests from various newspapers in the interior, a lightweight stereotype machine was specially created to allow various news photographs to be published in newspapers in areas where transportation is blocked, with extremely economical and swift procedures. Other efforts include assisting newspapers in various regions, managing advertising and sales, organizing investigations and publishing to seek newspaper contact. "Shen Shi" is happy to make efforts and implement any undertaking that is beneficial to our newspaper industry.</p>
<p>In February of this year, "Shen Shi" further sought organizational integrity, formally organized a limited liability company in accordance with the Company Law, collected sufficient funds, and established a board of directors. Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Li Shuxiong, Mr. Yu Zuoting, Mr. Zhang Xiaoru, Mr. Xiao Tongzi, Mr. Zhang Zhuping, Mr. Dong XianGuang, Mr. Pan Gongbi, and Mr. Mi Xingru were elected as directors, and Mr. Zhang Yishu and Mr. Song Chunfang were elected as supervisors. The application for government registration was submitted and approved on May 26, and the Ministry of Industry issued license number 715. Branch offices were established in Beijing, Hankou, Tianjin, and Hong Kong in accordance with the original plan. At the same time, the internal structure of the head office was reorganized, the scope of business was expanded, equipment was further improved, and the organization was further strengthened, with the aim of providing better services and more progressive cooperation for newspapers in various regions.</p>
<p>2.  Current Organization</p>
<p>Since "Shen Shi" has been legally established as a formal limited liability company, the current organization is entirely in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law. Nine directors are elected by the shareholders' meeting to form the board of directors, representing the company in the execution of important business and bearing the responsibility for supervision and control. Two supervisors are selected to perform supervisory duties. The board of directors appoints a general manager and a president of the head office, who execute the resolutions of the board of directors, handle the affairs of the news agency, and represent the news agency externally. Currently, there are seven departments.

<p>3.  Future Prospects</p>
<p>The commencement of "Shen Shi's" business was based on the convenience of the newspaper industry and its balanced development. The gradual development of its business to date has been due to the spirit of "not seeking private gain." This principle has been upheld without fail over the past decade and will continue to be upheld consistently in the future without any change. However, in view of the increasingly severe foreign aggression and the critical state of the country, foreign news businesses are taking advantage of their deep history and strong power to perform great spectacles in the international arena. Our colleagues in the newspaper industry bear a heavy responsibility in this difficult era, which goes without saying. The colleagues of "Shen Shi" are aware of the importance of their mission and will continue to serve the spirit of the newspaper industry in the future. In addition to further expanding existing business and striving to be the most faithful and effective news agency in the country, they will make further preparations for the unity of the nation and the revitalization of the country, and need to unite communication agencies and newspapers operated by Chinese people in order to compete with foreign communication agencies on the international stage. This is the greatest goal of "Shen Shi's" progress. The Associated Press of the United States and the United Press of Japan are good examples of successful integration in the newspaper industry. The colleagues of "Shen Shi" humbly wish to discuss this with wise people at home and abroad today, as they recall the past decade of struggle.</p>

<h3 id="e211">On the Family <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan Ru</p>
<p>Speaking of "family," there was a joke about it long ago. When I was in Beiping, a Western professor at a certain university, explaining the Chinese character for "family," said it meant a house filled with pigs, and that was the Chinese family. Of course, the university students in the audience were outraged, thinking the Western professor was intentionally insulting them, and as a result, he was expelled. So some people said that Westerners don't understand Chinese etymology, so they misinterpreted the character for "family." In fact, according to the great etymological work, the "Shuowen Jiezi," the character for "family" is derived from the radical 宀 (roof), and the phonetic component 豭 (boar) is abbreviated. Zhou Bowen said: the pen where pigs live is called a family, hence it is composed of 宀 and 豕 (pig). Later generations borrowed it to mean the family household. The Western professor's explanation was not wrong. Aren't 豭 and 豕 the same meaning?</p>
<p>The ancient Chinese family was not only very different from the small, one-husband-one-wife family of today, but also very different from the old-style large families that included fathers, sons, wives, brothers, uncles, aunts, and sisters-in-law. At that time, the family was almost like a small country, as in the so-called "family with a thousand chariots" or "family with a hundred chariots." Even now, these most ancient forms of families are not completely gone. Look at someone who becomes rich, and the people who eat with him number in the hundreds or thousands. Many of them can be idle without doing anything, holding the title of family retainer, and can get odd jobs at any time. Thus, the family becomes large, and the country suffers!</p>
<p>The most advanced people now are becoming members of society, while we are still clinging tightly to being members of a family. As the saying goes, "One person has good fortune, and it extends to the whole house." I don't know what lives under this roof?</p>
<p>The "Great Learning" says: "Those who wish to govern their state must first regulate their families." Chapter 9 says: "If his family cannot be taught, how can he teach others?" From this, it can be seen the importance of the family in terms of morality. Originally, regulation and teaching are troublesome things enough. To regulate and teach, one must nourish them richly, so everyone harbors selfishness and only cares about expanding the scope of their own family wealth. There are also some people who click their tongues and envy them, saying: "So-and-so's family fortune is not small!" Once so-and-so's family fortune is not small, then "one family doesn't cry, but the whole road cries loudly!" Alas, I have seen too much of this!</p>
<p>There is a wonderful metaphor for this. It is said that the Chinese family is like a locomotive, with a string of fancy cars, passenger cars, and even baggage cars and freight cars behind it. Of course, the locomotive is the head of the family. The locomotive rushes back and forth, sweating and exhausted. Sometimes it is too hard, and it feels like it can't pull it anymore, so it stops for a moment and sighs a few strange noises (the whistle)! If it is unhappy, the locomotive suddenly goes off the rails, and everything behind it will die a violent death.</p>
<p>So what should we do? We should no longer be locomotives, but should fly airplanes through the sky. If we crash, only I die, and at most three or five people die with me. This means that we should no longer sacrifice for the family, and we should no longer strive to expand our own family wealth. We should be free members of society! Otherwise, those who are related to our family cannot avoid</p>
<p>being pigs under the roof!</p>
<h3 id="e212">The Heat in Nanjing (1) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Shushan</p>
<p>Hot, hot, hot, this has almost become the universal cry of this summer.</p>
<p>Only because I am still enduring the heat in Nanjing, I don't know what the heat is like elsewhere. Just as people elsewhere certainly don't know exactly what the heat in Nanjing is like, I will, in between wiping away sweat, report the heat in Nanjing to the readers.</p>
<p>The weather in Nanjing, since the beginning of summer, has been the hottest in thirty years. Tracing back from the 24th of last month to today, in these 20 days, there was only one heavy rain on the evening of the 1st of this month, and the temperature quickly increased. Until the 5th, the indoor temperature reached 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Although it decreased slightly on the 10th, it still reached 98.5 degrees. However, on the 11th, it suddenly increased to 103 degrees. The intense heat has been even more severe these last two days. Yesterday, at noon, the indoor temperature rose to 102 degrees, and in the afternoon it continued to rise, reaching 108.5 degrees. Being in the room feels like being in a fiery pit, and it is difficult to endure even for a moment.</p>
<p>With such a drought and such heat, it is no wonder that the farmers are crying in distress. They have tried various methods to pray for rain, such as burning incense, worshiping Buddha, or parading with tied dragons. In fact, even though we live in the city, we also long for the early arrival of sweet rain to relieve the drought and heat, don't we? These past few days, just because the signs of disaster have already formed, rice has suddenly increased from one stone to more than two yuan, and vegetables have also doubled in price. We can't seal our mouths and not eat, or tighten our belts and not be hungry, so of course we are waiting for rain just like the farmers. Moreover, with this intense heat in the city, it feels like being steamed by the heat in a steamer, making it unbearable. It is necessary to have a heavy rain to dissipate it.</p>
<p>After all, this rare disaster is enough to move the compassionate heart of the living Buddha. This is the Panchen Lama, who returned after presiding over the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly for disaster relief and saving the country at West Lake. He couldn't bear to see the suffering of all living beings, so he wanted to move the will of heaven with his Buddhist teachings. Therefore, he set up altars everywhere to recite scriptures and pray for rain. It's just that the will of heaven was stubborn and refused to comply. Moreover, he was sweating and panting under the fiery canopy of the fire god, and had no way to resist the heat. Finally, he left Nanjing today, probably to escape the heat and go to Beiping. Although it is said that he will continue to pray for rain for us after he arrives in Beiping.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Literature and Self <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Dongsheng</p>
<p>The American literary critic Henry Neumsch once said, "Literature is the tune of the individual's soul, literature is the symbol of the individual's will." This statement is of course a bit of an overstatement, but we can admit that, in literary works, the spirit of the self deeply dominates. A literary work is nothing more than a "recording of the subjective impression of objective things," a "manifestation of the spirit of the self in the consciousness of the times." When the author's mind and the things in the environment cause a reflection, during the time of conceiving consciousness, the spirit of the self unconsciously assumes a strong force. Reading the author's work is no different from being guided by the author's thoughts, being influenced by the author's emotions. For example, reading Lermontov's poems, there are</p>
<p>bold rhymes, and in the strength of the words, you can hear the sound of swords. Jutcheff's poems have a strange and mysterious meaning, just like the ancient prophets speaking a</p>
<p>kind of terrifying and dangerous language in the middle of the night. Nekrasov's poems are crude and profound</p>
<p>tones, the intense emotions of damaged humanity, the lament of a disturbed conscience. Byron Shelley's poems are full of romantic and gorgeous qualities, while Uut U's new poems have a natural and profound flavor. When we read their poems, it is as if we see their people. The arrangement of words implies the leaping of their hearts, because in their works, their personalities are expressed, their spirits are revealed. Every great writer has his own special style, and we can also say that only those works that faithfully and without any hypocrisy express the secrets of one's own soul are successful and great products of the spirit.</p>
<p>Musset said, "Each person has his own wine glass. Although I drink from a small glass, this glass is mine!" Friends! Remember this sentence! Use your thoughts to write what you want to write. Don't look down on yourself too much. Don't you remember what Goethe said in a poem called "Self-Awareness"?</p>
<p>No matter who you are 丨丨 this is without distinction,</p>
<p>You 丨丨 are always a person, please do not demean yourself,</p>
<p>Look at yourself 丨丨 you yourself must say, that's right!</p>
<p>Becoming yourself is the most important condition for obtaining spiritual rewards. Becoming yourself is satisfying yourself. Becoming yourself is also denying yourself. Don't you remember Ibsen's words?</p>
<p>Kill the self within your heart.</p>
<p>And listen to becoming yourself 丨丨 that is 丨丨</p>
<p>Express yourself forever,</p>
<p>That master is willing to use what you express.</p>
<p>Friends! To put it concretely, becoming yourself is to develop the power accumulated in your heart and those abilities that have been feared, suppressed, and exploited by habits and traditions regarding the independence of the soul. That power and ability are the raw materials for your work, which can allow you to achieve a little, albeit weak, but glorious success.</p>
<p>What is written in violation of the soul and conscience is insignificant and base. You must always express yourself with yourself! Reject all forms of power, remove all arrogant attitudes, believe in yourself, regardless of gains and losses. If you think something can be revealed, you might as well reveal it. Remember Goethe's words as sung in "Der Sänger":</p>
<p>I sing clearly here,</p>
<p>Like a little bird singing on a branch,</p>
<p>The song bursts forth from my own throat,</p>
<p>This is my supreme reward.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I respectfully offer this little poem to the writers of today.</p>
<p>"Although the sound is small, it must come from your own throat," as Musset said:</p>
<p>"Each person has his own wine glass. Although I use a small wine glass, this glass is mine."</p>
<h3 id="e214">July 14th <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Zhili</p>
<p>This year's French National Day celebration in Shanghai was particularly lively, as reported in the Shen Bao:</p>
<p>"This year's lanterns and decorations are even more splendid than in previous years. The French Consulate, the Municipal Council, various police stations, fire brigades, health departments, the French barracks, and the Gujiazhai Garden are all covered in lanterns and decorations. The area around Rue du Consulat is especially dazzling and colorful. The huge lantern towers and arches in the ancient Chinese style at the three locations of Avenue Joffre, Route Cardinal Mercier, and the Eight Immortals Bridge are attracting tourists to stop and watch."</p>
<p>But under such splendid circumstances, those who rush to join in the fun are mostly Chinese. As Mr. Taisheng recorded in "New Shanghai":</p>
<p>"Night, pushing open the brilliantly lit, French National Day carnival.</p>
<p>Everywhere flew the red, blue, and white French flags. On the streets, strings of yellow-faced people, the ruled in this secondary colony.</p>
<p>On Rue Lafayette, a row of children, women, women in vests with cross-straps, young people in fashionable white pants, with green French park tickets and yellow French park</p>
<p>passes in their palms.</p>
<p>Hearts are so hot, blowing the cool July night wind. At the entrance of the French Park, the fire trees are painted with red and green lights</p>
<p>. On both sides, people rushed straight to the entrance from the intersection.</p>
<p>It's the French carnival! The yellow-faced people all pushed aside the defense line of the Qinglian-colored armed police as if they didn't care about their lives, rushed past the guard of the Annamese yellow-armed people, rushed! Rushed inside! These crazy yellow-faced people, pushing the cross-straps on the fashionable vests, pushing the fur coats of the old ladies, rushed through the defense line at the entrance from the crowded lane of yellow-faced people.</p>
<p>Look: the lights are brilliant, the French carnival in this city that never sleeps!</p>
<p>Crazy yellow-faced people! This is the French carnival</p>
<p>! These pitiful people who are ruled, have actually forgotten that this is the French National Day garden!"</p>
<p>The yellow-faced people are indeed people who love to join in the fun. Their joining in the fun is just joining in the fun, no matter what the fun is about. Who cares if it's the French National Day? In short, it's much more lively than the Chinese Republic's National Day, and that's good enough. Conversely, if it weren't for so many yellow-faced people rushing to join in the fun, then the "huge lantern towers and arches in the ancient Chinese style" would be set up in vain. And this, from the rulers' point of view, is sharing the joy with the people (the rulers), giving grace, and at the same time asking for gratitude and support. Therefore, under the "Great Self-Ringing Bell" on Rue du Consulat, there are two slogans: Vive la France! (Long live France!) and Vive la garde municipale de Shanghai! (Long live the municipal guard of Shanghai!) However, in the situation of "fire trees and silver flowers, the city opens and never sleeps," who is "indulging in intoxication and losing their minds"? It's not just the yellow-faced people. Even the citizens of French democracy, when they see the huge lantern towers and arches in the ancient Chinese style, would they ever think about why this arch was erected and remember the situation in Paris on July 14th, one hundred and forty-five years ago?</p>
<p>The situation in Paris on July 14th, one hundred and forty-five years ago, was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>"The people of Paris were already prepared. On the evening of the 13th, teams of armed people approached the Bastille fortress and exchanged gunfire with the guards. On the morning of the 14th, they gathered in large numbers on the road leading to the Bastille. They also had cannons, which they had seized from the Invalides; they also had guns and gunpowder, which they had searched for in cellars and churches; some were holding spears, halberds, hammers, and axes, and some even only had simple wooden sticks. The commander of the fortress looked down from the top of the wall and saw that the entire streets and alleys of the Saint-Antoine district were a black mass, and the heads of the rioters were approaching like waves. The roar was like a tidal wave, saying: "We want the Bastille fortress! Lower the drawbridge!" The commander was almost dizzy with fright at this situation.</p>
<p>"The first outer drawbridge of the Bastille was soon broken. The crowd poured into the commander's office. The guards of the Bastille opened fire to resist, and the two sides fired for more than three hours. Many people in the crowd were killed or wounded, but they were not afraid at all and continued to besiege in various ways. At the same time, the people of the entire city of Paris rose up, carrying cannons,</p>
<p>to provide support.</p>
<p>Finally, the guards surrendered. The commander handed over the key to the door of the inner drawbridge. The crowd occupied the fortress and released the prisoners buried in the prison. At this time, the emotions were very agitated. When the crowd saw the appearance of the prisoners, they shed tears. When the prisoners saw the sunlight and heard the cheers of the crowd welcoming their release from prison, they even fainted." (See Xu Maoyong: History of the French Revolution, New Life Popular Library edition.)</p>
<p>Thinking about it, this situation was more lively than July 14th in Shanghai in 1934. But what is the difference between these two kinds of liveliness? July 14th in Paris one hundred and forty-five years ago, French rioters destroyed the Bastille fortress, which represented French feudal politics. On the same day one hundred and forty-five years later, French rulers in Shanghai were sharing joy with the yellow-faced people, and among them were also the ruled French citizens.</p>
<p>The July 14th celebration created by the Parisian sans-culottes was seized by the French bourgeoisie, ordering "universal celebration" and supporting the French Republic forever. Thus, even the yellow-faced people were joining in the fun under the lanterns.</p>
<p>However, the only kind of fun that the yellow-faced people of Shanghai seem to be good at joining in is this kind.</p>
<h3 id="e215">A Wall (6) <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Roberto Bracco, translated by Xi Dichen</p>
<p>He draped his huge coat around him, hobbled away with his bad leg, muttering between gasps, "Go, go beg for food, go beg for food!"</p>
<p>The young man stood at the table, motionless, but calm and composed, softly saying, "From today on, endure hunger!" But the slanderous article was never written. Why, for what reason, did he not write it? He couldn't say. He looked around. The blinds were still closed. It was still night in his room. From the street, from the neighboring houses, in the midst of the confused sounds of awakening, the new life of the day floated</p>
<p>softly, softly. The sewing machine stopped. The old, solid wall was once again impenetrable. The wall hadn't let the light of dawn</p>
<p>filter through. It hadn't let the obscene words that a drunk, using a jailer's key, said to the woman who had been awake all night permeate through. When he came in, he had said to her, "If you don't give me something to eat by noon, I'll wring your neck like a chicken!"</p>
<p>Now this drunken fellow was already asleep, sleeping soundly. The woman, with a bundle of machine-sewn shirts under her arm, was preparing to go out, pleased that she had a way to satisfy his wishes. Before leaving the room, she thought of her neighbor. Her poor happiness—even her life—was owed to his compassionate tolerance.</p>
<p>He gently knocked on the wall. The young man trembled, as he was sitting like an idiot, staring blankly at the blank white paper. "Beg for food? But the sewing machine saved me from defiling—from slandering—a good person—are you asking me to smile? Are you asking me to smi..."</p>
<p>He could hear the woman in the next room calling him, so he gently knocked on the wall in reply. Then both of them simultaneously pressed their lips to the wall, and simultaneously said:</p>
<p>"Thank you!"</p>
<p>Neither side heard this joyful word, because both mouths touched the separating wall at the same time. When each left</p>
<p>the wall, they both murmured to themselves:</p>
<p>"It wasn't her!"</p>
<p>"It wasn't her!"</p>

<h3 id="e216">Ministry of Education Explains the Distinction Between Elementary School Names <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a submission from the Anhui Education Department regarding Article 11 of the elementary school regulations promulgated by the Ministry, which stipulates that provincial elementary schools shall be named after the place where they are located, and public elementary schools below the county and city level shall use place names of smaller areas as school names. When there are two or more identical public elementary schools in one place, they may be distinguished by the order of numbers. According to this, provincial elementary schools in the same location should be distinguished by First and Second, such as Anhui Provincial Anqing First Elementary School, Anhui Provincial Anqing Second Elementary School, etc. County elementary schools in the same county seat can also be named such as XX County City First Elementary School, XX County City Second Elementary School, etc. It is investigated that the elementary schools in the provincial capital of this province are all provincial. Can the above names be used to correct the current names, or should they be renamed Anhui Provincial Anqing XX (street name or lane name) Elementary School? Can the county elementary schools in each county seat be distinguished by numbers, or should they be renamed XX County, XX (street name or lane name) Elementary School? The Department did not dare to make a decision on its own, and therefore presents this request for examination and instructions to follow. The Department was instructed: It is investigated that the elementary schools in the provincial capital and various other levels of</p>
<p>elementary schools in county districts can be named after street and lane names, but if there are two or more identical elementary schools established on the same street or lane, they can be distinguished by numbers. You are to be informed immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Results of the Fourth Shandong Provincial Middle School Graduation Examination Announced ▲ 1,575 Pass, Marked Improvement Over Previous Years ▲ Students Are All Working Hard Towards Practical Science 丨 First Place Awarded Xu Xinglin a Book Coupon Worth 100 Yuan 丨 High School Students with 85 Points Exempted from Entrance Examination <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) The fourth provincial middle school graduation examination in this province was held in twenty-one districts throughout the province, starting on the 26th of last month and ending on the 28th. Due to continuous rain and muddy roads, the examination papers from various districts arrived in Jinan late. The members of the Examination Committee, despite the sweltering heat, reviewed the examination papers and calculated the scores late into the night. It is now completed and was announced on the 16th. It is calculated that this time, including those who participated in the examination and those who took the makeup exam from the previous session, there were more than 3,200 people in total. 1,575 passed. Calculated as a percentage, about 77% passed, 16% failed two or more subjects and should take a makeup exam, and 7% failed three or more subjects and should repeat the grade. The number is less than the previous session. The middle schools that previously had poorer performance have also shown great improvement. In Anqiu, Changqing, Dongping and other county middle schools, not a single student repeated the grade. There were three students with scores above 90 in the first session, three in the second and third sessions, and this session suddenly increased to seven. This is with the examination scores and school scores calculated together. If the examination scores were calculated separately, there would be even more students with scores above 90. This shows that students are all diligently studying. The Education Department intends to give the best students prizes in addition to exempting them from the entrance examination to encourage them. The specific method has not yet been determined. In terms of subjects, Chinese and Party Principles were better in the previous sessions, while science was inferior, with biology being the worst. Although Chinese and Party Principles were not as good as before in this session, science has greatly improved. It can be seen that students are all working hard towards practical science. This new change is quite noteworthy. All of the above proves that the previous examinations have had a very significant effect.</p>
<p>(Jinan, 17th) The school performance in the middle school examination is as follows: Grade A (80 points or above): Jinan First Junior Middle School; Grade B (70 points or above): Dexian Provincial Junior Middle School and 13 other schools; Grade C (60 points or above): Zhucheng Provincial Junior Middle School and 31 other schools; Grade D (50 points or above): Jinan Private Zhengyi Junior Middle School and 3 other schools. In terms of student performance, Xu Xinglin of Jinan Girls' Middle School scored 95 points, the highest in the province, and was awarded a book coupon worth 100 yuan. The remaining six students with scores above 90 were awarded 80 yuan in book coupons for second place, 60 yuan for third place, and 50 yuan each for fourth to seventh place. A total of 78 students with scores above 85 were exempted from the written entrance examination. In addition, six high school students with scores above 85 were exempted from the written entrance examination. The Education Department awarded book coupons worth 100 yuan, 80 yuan, and 60 yuan to the first, second, and third place students at Shandong University, Shandong Provincial Medical College, and Qilu University, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Educational Research Institute of the National Central University to Recruit Graduate Students <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The College of Education of the National Central University is the earliest established and most prestigious academic research and talent cultivation institution in education in the country. In the past twenty years, almost all activities that have promoted the cause of education have been closely related to the College. The College has conducted many experimental studies over the years. In February of this year, it also established an Educational Research Institute, concentrating talent and equipment, expanding the scope of experiments, and making more important contributions to the solution of current educational problems in our country. The founding process and general situation of the Institute have been reported in previous newspapers. Now, it is heard that in response to requests from various parties, it has been decided to recruit eight graduate students during this summer vacation to engage in various experimental studies under the guidance of professors. Graduates from education or psychology departments of domestic universities, or graduates from other departments with education or psychology as a minor, are eligible to apply. The recruitment brochure will be announced soon. The current talent and equipment of the Institute and the treatment of graduate students are excerpted below:</p>
<p>(1) Talents: All professors from the Education and Psychology departments of the National Central University are instructors at the Institute. The two departments currently have eighteen professors, all of whom are the most renowned educational scholars and psychologists in the country, such as Ai Xianzhou, Du Zuozhou, Xiao Xiaorong, Xu Kesheng, Zhang Shiyi, Meng Xiancheng, Chen Jianxiu, Pan Huo, Wu Nanxuan, Wang Shulin, Gao Junshan, Zhao Gengchuan, Zhong Daozan, Gui Zhibai, Xiong Wenmin, Wang Fengming, Xia Chengfeng, and Zhao Tingwei.

<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Education Bureau instructed private high schools and above in the city, stating: "In the case of Instruction No. 8121 from the Ministry of Education, it is stated that, as approved by the Training Directorate, the method of calculating military training grades for students in high schools and above has been previously agreed upon and implemented. Now, it has been found that some students in various schools do have diseases that prevent them from engaging in strenuous exercise, and the calculation of their scores for those who have been approved to be exempted from practical training should be specified so that various schools can follow. The Ministry now intends to stipulate that, for students who have been approved to be exempted from military training practical training, the score for military training academics will be used as their military training grade. We hereby consult to check if you agree and hope that your Ministry will issue an order to your subordinates to comply with this, and we look forward to a reply, etc." In addition to replying in agreement and issuing separate orders, we hereby urgently order you to inform all public and private high schools and above under your jurisdiction to comply with this order, etc. We hereby order you to comply with this order."</p>

<p>According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, graduates from unregistered private high schools are not allowed to take entrance exams for registered universities. However, in order to remedy the situation for graduates from unregistered middle schools and allow them to continue their studies without wasting their education, the Municipal Education Bureau held a pre-entrance exam last year. Those who passed the pre-entrance exam were qualified to take entrance exams for registered universities. Now, it has been found that there are many graduates from unregistered private middle schools in the city in the second semester of the 22nd year. The question of whether they can take entrance exams for registered universities has attracted the attention of school authorities. Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency went to the Municipal Education Bureau to inquire about the truth. According to Commissioner Zhou Shang of the Bureau, the graduates of unregistered high schools this year will still take the entrance exams first according to last year's method before the Ministry of Education determines a method. After the method is determined, they will take a supplementary pre-entrance exam.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Recent News from the Municipal Martial Arts Hall Summer Class <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Martial Arts Hall has specially established a summer martial arts training class, which officially began teaching yesterday. The majority of members who have joined are from the academic community, but there are also many from the business community. Because the curriculum set by the class is both accelerated and practical, and the fees are low and the teaching is serious, it can indeed meet the purpose of popularizing and promoting martial arts. Therefore, the number of people who have registered and joined in recent days has been quite enthusiastic. However, because the quota is limited, those who are interested in martial arts should register as soon as possible to avoid missing the opportunity. To request a chapter, please send a letter to the hall at Xinkaihe, Minguo Road.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the player does not make the most of the follow-through, then the power of the stroke will inevitably be slowed down invisibly. Therefore, one must avoid loosening the force unless the racket follows the arm to use up all the power before stopping. To do this, one must make the racket light and flexible when swinging, which requires making full use of the follow-through. Furthermore, the racket following the arm to exhaust the power can also automatically affect the spin of the hit ball. The effect of this type of ball spin will be studied in detail later when discussing hitting techniques and the effect of ball spin.</p>
<p>(Note) This paragraph should be connected to the end of Chapter 2, that is, the last section of (6) published on the 16th. The following is connected to (7) published on the next 7th (that is, Chapter 3, Serving)</p>
<p>When serving, tennis players use different hitting methods, but in any case, the most common method is to turn the arm behind the head before actually hitting, and the wrist folds the racket, so that the racket head faces backward. Some players only lower the racket head to the same level as the wrist, and some players lower the racket head below the shoulder or rest it on the shoulder. When the racket head is down, the wrist is bent backward. When hitting, the force that splits forward from the shoulder to the upper arm to the lower arm will drag the wrist and racket forward. However, at this time, the racket is still hanging behind the wrist. When hitting the ball, the wrist will immediately fold the racket forward again, the racket will be straightened, and the ball will be heavily split.</p>
<p>When serving, the ball must be turned downwards and obliquely. It is actually impossible to serve over the head without twisting the ball downwards. Because when hitting, if you only erect the racket and shoot the ball straight to the opponent, as long as the speed of the ball is slightly stronger, it will inevitably cross the boundary. From this point of view, twisting the ball can not only guide the flight of the ball, but also</p>
<p>make the ball just fall within the boundary of the opponent's service area.</p>
<p>The method of twisting the ball will be studied in detail later. Now we only need to know that twisting the ball is to make the flight of the ball oblique, not flying straight out. If the player twists the ball from the side, the ball will slightly twist its direction and fly away because it touches the side of the racket. Therefore, when hitting the ball, the racket head turns forward and pounces, which will cause the ball to tend to twist, causing it to fall slightly downwards out of a straight line. The greater the twisting force, the heavier the hitting force must be, and it can also make the ball accurately fall</p>
<p>within the opponent's very narrow service area.</p>
<p>Based on the above principles, Americans have invented a twisting serve, and it has proven to be very effective. This method hits the ball with great force, and at the same time adds a great twisting force on the side of the ball, so the ball quickly rotates towards the opponent, and lands extremely quickly, and then emits an extremely unpredictable rebound from the ground. To produce this effect, the server's body must first lean back, and then straighten up smoothly. When the ball is in contact with the ball, the hitting action is upward and outward.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of this American twisting serve is to make the ball and the racket have a long contact time within the possible range, so that the ball can rotate once on the racket surface, so that the ball has an extremely fast rotation force when it flies out. The initial contact point between the racket and the ball is at the lower rear of the ball, and then it takes advantage of the trend to turn upwards and outwards to the right. When the ball is about to be hit, the racket head must also contact the top of the ball, so that it flies obliquely to the ground to the opponent, and generates extremely fast rotation force. This American serve is very difficult to learn. Beginners should not try it lightly before they have mastered the ordinary overhead straight shot.</p>
<p>Since the basic work of serving is to make the ball fly over the net and just fall within the restricted area, it is not easy for beginners to succeed without hard practice. When practicing, it is best to ask a friend to stand on the other side so that the ball can be thrown back, so that the ball can be served to the opponent again and again, until it can achieve the purpose every time, that is considered the beginning of success in ball skills.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the technique should be practiced faster and faster, until the ball flies out with absolute accuracy. If the ball is shot straight to the opponent, and the landing point is always accurately over the boundary of the service area by several feet, then the beginner must not be discouraged at this time, but should add more effort, then the flight of the ball can be easily shortened, and the movement of hitting the ball is still very fast, then you have to use the above-mentioned twisting hitting method. Because the ball is forced by a very heavy twisting force, it will certainly not still form a straight line when it flies out, and its flight will also be shortened.</p>
<p>The actual action of serving is to use the tendency of the arm to pounce forward, and the wrist takes advantage of the trend to twist the backward racket over, and then use the force from the shoulder and arm to quickly sweep the ball forward. At this time, the extremely fast momentum of the racket, plus the body weight and the rotation of the shoulder, makes the force of shooting the ball extremely large.</p>
<p>When the serving action reaches the final stage when the ball is about to leave the racket, the arm should follow the trend and pounce the racket downwards as much as possible, just like returning the ball in the court as usual, and naturally stop only after exhausting the follow-through force. The actions of some famous tennis players after hitting the ball are different. Some rackets must pounce downwards as much as possible, and the racket head reaches the left or right of the left foot, or just in front of the left foot. As for the American twisting serve, because the racket is pouncing to the side, the racket head is always dragged to the right side of the player's body when it falls. Some players who are good at using the twisting method only have the racket head falling on the right side of the right knee, and there are one or two players whose racket drop is higher than this, even just outside the right side.</p>
<p>A missed serve can be said to be "over" the first time, and "fault" the second time, so after one mistake, you must concentrate and never let it repeat the same mistake, thus losing a point. Experienced players never make mistakes due to negligence when serving. When serving, never use force, the more you force, the easier it is to make mistakes, so you should practice often, so that the hitting technique is extremely free, light and easy, with a calm attitude, and the ball is shot accurately at the prepared position, even if there is a mistake, you can still be calm, that is considered to be deeply aware of the</p>
<p>essence of ball skills.</p>
<p>Since the privilege of serving is at hand, it is necessary to make the best use of it, and never let this attack weapon be as if it does not exist.</p>

<p>— Original work by Princess Deling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Among the many people I have seen in my life, he can be considered the most unfortunate character! At the same time, he is also the most lovable person.</p>
<p>I think this trip to Fengtian will at least give him some comfort!</p>
<p>(10) (1) Female officials and palace maids</p>
<p>This time, the Empress Dowager went to Fengtian. Due to the limited capacity of the carriages, all the arrangements were greatly reduced. She could not bring too many female officials and palace maids who served her closely. In addition to the eight of us female officials who followed her, she only brought sixteen palace maids. These people did not receive any salary and were considered volunteer positions. The origins of us female officials were almost all daughters of high-ranking Manchu officials. The palace maids were selected from the most beautiful daughters of many Manchu soldiers and generals. In name, female officials were certainly nobler than palace maids, but in practice, I believe</p>
<p>that in many ways, it was more comfortable to be a palace maid than a female official.</p>
<p>Being a female official in the Qing Palace not only did not receive a salary, but was also a bitter job that had to be paid for. To be honest, when my sister and I were in the palace, my father often had to send money in for us to use. Every month, Rong Ling and I spent a full one hundred taels of silver just to reward those cooks. The Empress Dowager would also give us things from time to time, which cost even more. Because when the Empress Dowager gave us things, she had to teach the eunuchs to hold them and send them over, and these eunuchs had to be given tips. Moreover, they all had a mind full of commercialized ideas. For example, if the Empress Dowager gave us six or seven things at a time, they would each take one and send them over six or seven times. By doing this, our money was spent even more easily. For example, if six or seven things were sent at once, we only needed to give them twenty or thirty taels of silver for tips. If they were divided into six or seven times, we would have to give at least ten taels each time, which would add up to sixty or seventy taels. (85)</p>
<h3 id="e249">An Old Woman in Qingjiangpu <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>In a certain year, something like this happened in Qingjiangpu: When the XXX army attacked Qingjiangpu, there was not even a single soldier in Qingjiangpu city. The XXX army, which was accustomed to killing and arson, had already reached five or six li away from the South Gate and was about to enter the city. If they entered the city of Qingjiangpu, the place would definitely be ruined. But at this time, the people of Qingjiangpu were all hiding in their homes, and there was not a single person on the street. How could they stop this team of robber soldiers? At this critical moment, a very dangerous moment, an old woman suddenly appeared. She could not bear to see such a large Qingjiangpu being raped and looted by these robber soldiers, so she risked her life to try to save this misfortune. So she dressed up as a sweet potato seller, carrying a wooden bucket filled with hot sweet potatoes, and shouted loudly two or three li away from the South Gate: "Selling sweet potatoes!" "Selling sweet potatoes!" After a while, the XXX soldiers arrived. Seeing that there was a sweet potato seller, they rushed to eat them and asked her which road to take to Qingjiangpu. She pointed them to a fork in the road leading to another place. Sure enough, they were fooled. By the time they realized they had been deceived and walked back on this road, the reinforcements had already arrived. So Qingjiangpu was saved. The old woman saw that the goal had been achieved and the wish had been fulfilled, so she returned silently! Later, the people of Qingjiangpu knew about it and said it was the transformation of the Bodhisattva Guanyin, so it has been passed down to this day, and a good story has turned into a myth.</p>

<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>Once, I passed in front of the Continental Nanchang on Nanjing Road and saw a well-dressed upper-class man jump out of a rickshaw and walk into the China National Products Company. That person was still very young and a bit frivolous. But he didn't pay the rickshaw fare. The rickshaw puller waited and waited, and became impatient and screamed more anxiously. Naturally, I only had sympathy for him, not dislike, rickshaw pullers are mostly pitiful.</p>
<p>Out of sympathy for him, I stood by, wanting to see the outcome. (Although it was only an insignificant and impractical concern) But after ten minutes, the passenger still hadn't come out. The rickshaw puller had no choice but to pull another customer and leave.</p>
<p>Alas, the so-called upper class!</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Once again, it was in front of the British barracks in Shanghai. Two anemic Chinese girls were flirting with British soldiers, using fingers to talk and bargain. I knew they were the so-called "saltwater girls."</p>
<p>The price was not settled, and the Chinese girl was about to leave strategically, but her four feet moved very slowly: the British soldier was shouting loudly, probably wanting to change his mind. Many vendors and rickshaw pullers on the roadside were laughing at that situation. Some even said some nasty things. I only had sympathy and a depressed and unhappy heart!</p>
<p>I hope I never see those things again.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 32: The general amuses himself with sensual pleasures all day long, the old and the young cry, and few soldiers return from battle</p>
<p>Second Master told me that their sister-in-law had a distant relative relationship with the Huang family, so they knew each other. I looked at the situation, the two were very affectionate, probably openly, so I casually said to him with a smile: When can we ask Second Master Gan to treat us to wine? This is a general question, you can say that it is asking Miss Huang, or you can say that it is not asking Miss Huang. He understood it very well and said it was too early! too early! Miss Huang stood aside and just smiled. You think, isn't this matter clearly here? When Guizhi heard these words, she couldn't say what kind of mixed feelings she had in her heart. Her heart was beating and her face was red. After a long time, she said: This is news. Zhao Weng said: Okay, stop talking, let's talk about serious things, shall we? Saying that, he turned his face to Jiang, because he said: This time I went to the city, I did do something serious. My old boss said to me, your son is not in Xiyuan Building, why do you still live in Haidian? He asked me to move to the backyard of his grain store. He said, it's not letting me live in the house for free. There are inevitably some small things in the store, and I would like me to take care of them. I thought it was good, first, I live in the city, I have more friends, and I can find something easy to do every day, so as not to be bored. Secondly, it is not far from the maternity hospital, and Guizhi will be taken care of when she is in confinement. I came back to discuss with you, are you willing or not? When Guizhi heard that she was going to move to the city, she first had a smile on her face. Jiang saw that her father-in-law and daughter-in-law had the same opinion, so naturally she did not disagree. So after discussing for a while, it was decided that they would move into the city three days later. On this day, Zhao Weng first went to the city to arrange the house. Jiang put the furniture to be moved on a large cart and pushed the large cart with Xiaolin all the way. Only Guizhi was a pregnant woman, unable to sit in that heavy cart, so she hired a familiar rickshaw from the street to slowly pull her into the city. (436)</p>

<p>The electric lights in the hotel were so dim and bleak!</p>
<p>K and I were sitting on the edge of the bed chatting idly. Suddenly an old woman walked into the room. Her face, covered with chicken skin-like wrinkles, set off her two lively eyeballs, which made people hate her. Behind her was a girl of about seventeen or eighteen years old with some country habits, standing very naturally outside the threshold.</p>
<p>"Sir, would you like a girl to accompany you..." the old woman said.</p>
<p>Zang Zhi Anwei Shepherd Zang Xi</p>
<p>"..." K and I subconsciously cast a surprised glance at the girl. The old woman then skillfully reached out and dragged the girl to our front.</p>
<p>"Say hello to the gentleman..." the old woman ordered the girl.</p>
<p>"Sir..." The young girl lowered her head to her chest, a blush appeared on her cheeks, and her voice was so soft, so soft.</p>
<p>But we realized that there was something strange about this matter. Obviously, the two of them were not related as mother and daughter, but had another special characteristic, which was exposed from the girl's lowered, shy red face and her pair of melancholy, fearful eyes.</p>
<p>"Is she your mother?" K, who was always impatient and lacked experience in the world, pointed at the old woman and questioned her;</p>
<p>"..." The young girl hesitated for a while, afraid to tell her hidden pain, and barely uttered a "Yes..." from her throat, which seemed to be blocked by something. The voice was very sad, almost crying. Especially the expression on her face was like the pleading expression of a lamb waiting to be slaughtered, which was so touching.</p>
<p>However, the old woman suddenly changed her face and then said fiercely, "Go, go!" The young girl followed the old woman out of the room! Finally disappeared at the end of the corridor.</p>
<p>The electric lights in the hotel were still so dim and bleak</p>
<p>We were lost and silent in the lonely atmosphere!</p>

<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>▲Letter from Berlin (Part 2)</p>
<p>In April weather, night falls quickly in the north. The twilight of Berlin turns into a fairy tale world. The stars in the sky emit timid flashes of light, all of which are ingenious artificial lights.</p>
<p>At night, we can see many strong incandescent lamps in the Berlin metropolis, illuminating various majestic buildings. The parliament, a palace-like building, is immersed in electric light, just like a crystal palace.</p>
<p>Berlin's Parliament</p>
<p>If you live in the city for a long time, you may want to go to the suburbs near Berlin to breathe the fresh air in the forest. The famous "Sanssouci Palace" is the German Versailles. Near the villa, we can mourn the windmill mill called "Sanssouci". According to a German fable passed down from generation to generation, there used to be an old owner living in that mill. The emperor built a villa and imperial garden near the mill. He took a fancy to the mill and wanted the miller to give it to him. Who knew that the old man stubbornly refused. Someone was worried for him, saying that he had offended the emperor and was afraid that he would suffer an unexpected disaster. The old man replied calmly: "The emperor has his own palace and garden, and he can enjoy himself freely. The mill is my property, and I have my rights. If he wants to invade, I can sue him in court. What's there to worry about?" This is the origin of the names "Sanssouci Palace" and "Sanssouci Mill".</p>
<p>If you want other entertainment, you can spend your time in Berlin's major theaters. There are all kinds of operas from the north and south, and you can choose the one that suits your interest and enter. The prices are different, and a seat in front of an orchestra usually costs 20 marks, which is equivalent to 180 square meters of currency. (About 20 yuan in national currency)</p>
<p>This nation, which is rich in practical perseverance and highly modern, is a nation with the soul of a musician. The operas they perform must be seen once. One night, we watched "Der Rosenkavalier", and the music was so beautiful and moving!</p>
<p>If we miss the opportunity to appreciate this musical opera, we will inevitably feel that this trip to Berlin outside the Rhine River is not perfect.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Gold Standard, Good at One Yuan Four Jiao; Exchange Market Uncertain, People's Hearts Weary; A Day of Fatigue Followed by Stability <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw wavering sentiment and a tendency toward fatigue. The market condition for the day saw a fall and then a rise, finally stabilizing. At the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market saw parity between the English and American markets. The forward silver price at the Five Metals Exchange was near parity but slightly up, ranging from five hao to one and a half li. However, the number of contracts traded was limited, making it difficult to influence people's sentiments. Exchange rates were long. The price of spot gold in London decreased by half a penny, American cotton rose by fifteen pound notes, American wheat decreased by six point two five, and stocks fell by one yuan and nine jiao eight fen. People's hearts continued to be weary. Although the preliminary trading showed a slight increase, the underlying trend was particularly fatigued. Reuters reported that speculators in London and the Indian market are now paying attention to rumors that the Indian government has sold 100 million ounces of silver at a price of four jiao nine fen American dollars to New York, and that the Indian government expressed surprise at this report, and that after the San Francisco strike, harbor workers also have the same trend and other telegraphic dispatches. At this time, the market situation was hovering. After the opening, people were extremely timid. Banks' appetite remained clogged. The exchange market was loose and excessive. Large firms frequently exerted pressure, and the gold market was therefore difficult to support and fell. But the HSBC's posted price remained level, and people's sentiments gradually stabilized. There was a lot of buying to cover at low prices. Fuchang and the Central Bank exchanged spot orders, first issuing orders, and market sentiment became firmer. Banks' appetite was reversed for long-term orders, and the gold market gradually rose. Guangchun Hengxing sold vigorously, resulting in many positions being covered midway. The night silver price in Seattle was reported to have shrunk by two point five, risen by one point two five, remain unmoved, and grown by three point seven five. The price was high but slightly declined, but the situation was very stable and could still rise. It was flat at noon. Later in the market, the Seattle night silver price was reported to have risen by one point two five, fallen by one point two five, risen by one point two five, and remained unmoved. The market was clear and level. The domestic market seemed tight due to brokers' collusion. Buyers in the market were excited and prices rose, but banks' appetite continued to be clogged, and frequent offers were made at high prices. The gold market still had no chance to be excited and gradually retreated. Mumbai telegraphed a fall of one point two anna, slightly stabilized, with the price of pure gold calculated at 996 yuan, and the swap spread around four yuan. The day's market conditions will now be recorded.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 984 yuan and a half, an increase of one yuan and three jiao compared to the previous close. The price of goods opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with recent selling prices of English exchange at one shilling four pence one eight seven five, American exchange at thirty-four yuan, and Huabi Sai September American dollars one eight seven five. Da Decheng, Yuan Maoyong, Yingfeng Heng, and Daxingyong, Hongxing gradually decreased from four yuan and seven jiao. Mitsui came out with September American dollars two five and decreased to two yuan. Fuyu, Tongchun, and Yongli advanced, pulling up to one yuan, and people's sentiments were still weary. Although Yuqingyong and the Dalian gang advanced, Qianchangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, Da Decheng, and Hongli sold again and retreated to two yuan and three jiao. Macgarry came out with October American dollars three seven five as well. HSBC's posted prices were announced, with England and America still level. Some people maintained prices while taking advantage of the low. Tianfeng, Hengyu, Shunli, Dachangxiang, and Yifengyong advanced together and reported a rebound. Hengyu advanced vigorously and Da Decheng and Yongli also accepted, rising to four yuan and six jiao. Yuqingyong, Yuanmaoyong, Hengxing, and Da Decheng took advantage of the high price to sell, falling to three yuan and four jiao. Dingkang and Hengyu still advanced, rising to above four yuan. After entering, although Hengxing sold, Hengyu, Fuchang, Huixiang, Yifengyong, Da Decheng, Yuankangxiang, Qianchangxiang, Shunmao, and others bought vigorously. Macgarry and others colluded on October American dollars three one two five, rising to five yuan and seven jiao. Under the supply of Hengxing, Bingxing, and Yingfengheng, the Seattle night silver price rose more and fell less, and was divided again into five yuan. Under the advance of Hengyu, Yuanchun, and Yuanchangyong, it once rose to five yuan and nine jiao. Fuxingyong, Hengxing, Yuanmaoyong, and Fuyu took advantage of the high price to supply, and then retreated to four yuan and two jiao. People's sentiments were still stable. Hongxing had some buying appetite and the situation was quite stable. The noon closing was 984 yuan and seven jiao, and goods were auctioned at five yuan and two jiao. After the close, it rose to above five yuan, and Shengda sold vigorously to level the price.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 984 yuan and eight jiao, and goods opened at four yuan and seven jiao. The night silver price rose and fell. The upper market was stable and people's sentiments were quite good. Banks made swaps for October American dollars two five. Yuanmaoyong, Da Decheng, Daxingyong, Hengxingyuan, and others advanced and rose to six yuan and a half. Yuanchun and Fuyu sold offers and retreated to within six yuan. The situation was mostly consolidation. Huabi Macgarry came out with September American dollars one eight seven five as well. After entering, Huabi Mitsui came out with November American dollars three seven five. Under the supply of Yuanchun, Yongfeng Yuqingyong, and Futaiheng, the price fell to four yuan and four jiao. Mumbai telegraphed a decrease of one anna. Yuqingyong and others bought on the dip, rising to four yuan and seven jiao. After hovering, the closing price was 984 yuan and six jiao, and goods were auctioned at four yuan and a half. After the close, there were quite a few buyers, but Shen Da Yong sold vigorously to level the price. Checking the highest price of the day at 986 yuan and a half, and the lowest price at 982 yuan, there was a difference of four yuan and a half. As a result, it rose slightly by one yuan and four jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on HSBC Bank's American exchange posted price unchanged, still at thirty-three yuan six two five, equivalent to a standard gold price of one thousand and twenty-nine yuan. According to the closing price, it was about pressing forty-four yuan, which was about pressing one yuan less than the previous closing. The registered price for August was 989 yuan, and for September it was 985 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 989 yuan, and the afternoon water replenishment was the same price. The price of pure gold was calculated at 996 yuan, and transactions in the market were still flat. Tianjin goods were about plus fourteen yuan zero, sold by the Tianjin gang. The spot number and money shop gang slightly accepted, totaling about one thousand taels. Eastern goods were plus thirteen yuan, and spot number houses also made purchases. Fuchang sold spot goods to the Central Bank, reportedly 700 bars, priced at 984 yuan and a half. On the one hand, the Central Bank swapped to shillings, containing a hedging nature, and on the other hand, it could avoid interest charges (July spot), and on the other hand, it could offset September contracts. People also hoped to add in, and the swaps were stable. Initially, Qianchangxiang Wanxing gave to Richang Dingtai for three yuan four five jiao. Dachangxiang Qianchangxiang still issued. Although Tongtaichang had advances, it still rose. Changshengyong Dachangxiang Hongli, etc., gave to the Dalian gang, later adding to four yuan and two jiao. In the after-market, Runchangyong Dekang gave to Wanxing at the same price, and Hengyu gave to Yingfengheng for four yuan. Changshengyong gave to Tongfengheng for four yuan and five fen. There were 17,143 August contracts remaining, with a total of eight bulls and thirty bears.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were average. In summary, Yuanmaoyong Hengxingsheng Dadingtai Yicheng Yuqingyong Huiyuan Da Decheng Yiyu Hongxing Yuanchun Chunyuan Yongfu Taiheng Yongde Yongde Wanxing Hengyu, etc., were on the selling side. Fuyu Yifengyong Hengxingyuan Dingkang Tianfeng Yongheng Changyong Yongli Hongkang Yongshen Kangxiang Bingxing Changshengyong Hengtai Fuan Tianfeng Shunmao Yuanchangyong, etc., were on the buying side. Fuxingyong Yuanyuanxiang Hengyu first advanced and then retreated, Shengshengdaxingyong first retreated and then advanced. The Dalian gang Wanxing did a total of more than 1,100 contracts, netting out about 400. Shunli did a total of more than 1,800 contracts, netting out less than 100. The Guangdong gang Shengshengda advanced and retreated about 200 contracts each, but still transferred more than 200 contracts to Hengxing. Hengxing advanced a small number, and sold more than 900. There were 33,726 September futures chips, with a total of 40 bulls and 59 bears.

<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, large London orders and New York silver prices were uniformly stable. Forward silver prices were flat and far slightly shrunk. Spot gold in London fell by half a penny, the pound against the dollar rose by half a point, the dollar against the pound rose by one two five, the pound against the franc fell by six pound notes, and the dollar against the franc rose by one point.

Compared to the previous close, both English and American exchanges were level. Banks' appetites remained clogged. The market saw slackness as soon as it opened. After entering, HSBC Bank's posted prices were announced, with England and America still lacking changes. People's sentiments were stable. Chinese merchants wanted to cover but failed. Banks also covered forward orders. The process gradually tightened. At noon, the process was stable. Banks were only doing swaps. The Seattle night silver price report showed more rises and fewer falls, lacking changes as well. The night silver price rose and fell in the after-market, consolidating the dollar forward. At this time, it was still tight. Banks' appetites were still clogged, and the trend was still loose. The closing selling price for recent English exchange was one shilling four pence one eight seven five and American exchange was thirty-four yuan. Compared to the previous close, both English and American exchanges were flat. Chinese merchants had both covering and filling. The net was slightly covering the American dollar September against November American dollar spread three one two five, given by Sassoon to Sumitomo, and Mitsui to Dongfang.

<h3 id="e256">Foreign Call Still Open at 5% <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the financial market, due to the small volume of transactions, the market was quiet again, and not as strong as at the beginning of the week. The foreign call rate fell back to its original position of 5%, without any changes. The overall economic downturn is a systemic issue, and not merely a phenomenon limited to a segment of the financial community. As such, now is not the right time to seek expansion of financial operations; the improvement seen the previous day was simply a regular occurrence, not an indication of real progress. The "drawing heads to add water" only served to dilute the excessive head count, rendering the entire exercise futile. In the call loan market, overnight and new transactions totaled over 3.4 million in the morning and over 200,000 in the afternoon. Small total society transactions totaled over 400,000. Transactions involving foreign collateral saw redemptions of over 900,000 and new transactions of over 1.2 million. Bank settlements included over 2.0 million in Chinese bank settlement drafts, over 4.7 million in various goods, exchange margin deposits, and miscellaneous settlements, over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 600,000 in warehouse entries. Chinese bank settlements included over 2.4 million in Chinese bank settlement drafts, over 4.6 million in various goods, exchange margin deposits, and miscellaneous settlements, over 600,000 in customs duties, and 800,000 in warehouse exits. Japanese bank settlements included over 1.7 million in Japanese bank settlement drafts, over 2.2 million in various goods, exchange margin deposits, and miscellaneous settlements, and 400,000 in warehouse entries. Money shops and foreign public orders settlements totaled over 38 million, foreign "drawing heads" (cheques) received 4.7 million, banknotes collected 600,000, issued 900,000, various remittance orders 700,000, cash settlements 600,000, inflow of 300,000, outflow of 200,000. Also, the total number of clearing exchange on the 17th by the city's Clearing House was 13,153,233.71 silver dollars, including 9,422,623.08 silver dollars in cash and 3,730,610.64 silver dollars in remittances.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver coins were 836 yuan in the morning and 836 yuan and five jiao in the afternoon, only a half yuan decrease from the previous day. The number of transactions was 4,000 jiao in the morning and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon. The double dimes were 727 yuan and six jiao in the morning and 727 yuan in the afternoon, the same as the previous day's afternoon market.

The transaction value was 8,300 foreign dollars, equivalent to 27,265,000 cash coins.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Securities and Public Bonds Saw Large Investors Buying; Market Showing a Slight Rally; Gains Ranging from Several Jiao to One Yuan <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market on the Chinese Securities Exchange showed a slight rally, as the political unrest did not immediately materialize, and the short positions that had been opened for many days were very large. Retail longs were increasingly scarce, and large investors, such as numbers 4, 46, 50, and 53, had been buying successively. Furthermore, as the settlement period neared, there were too many accounts in arrears, leading to active covering of floating shorts. The market price reverted to a rising trend. Yesterday's session saw an opening gain of half a yuan for the Dismissal bonds. Subsequently, various other bonds also showed firmness. In particular, the 20 Customs bonds gained the most, rising by seven jiao. The demand from numbers 4 and 46, among others, caused the trading floor to see demand exceeding supply. It was evident that the willingness to sell off had not yet been relinquished, leading to a shortage of chips. In the second session, the Retrenchment 19 Customs bonds initially appeared somewhat weak, lacking vigor. However, due to the continued strong demand from large investors, they gradually became firmer. The entire 6 bonds rose by half a yuan, with the 96 bonds performing well, rising by six to seven jiao. The situation was quite favorable, with the rising trend showing signs of intermittent continuation. The market price resulted in gains ranging from several jiao to one yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated at around 20 million yuan. The results of the gains and losses are shown in the comparative table on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York stock market yesterday (16th) was greatly alarmed by the general strike in San Francisco recently. Railway companies are said to be issuing new bonds due to insufficient expenditures, so speculators are thinking of selling. The New York stock market has shown a downward trend due to these two pieces of news. Various stocks on the small exchange have also fallen, while bonds have been floating and sluggish. American government bonds have also shown a slight zigzagging state. The wheat market has declined due to the profit-taking by longs and the alleged increase in supply. The total volume traded for the day was 590,000 shares (securities). Today's stock market is weak due to the impact of the strike, and buyers are holding back to watch, resulting in sparse trading (grains). The market has rebounded due to a small number of profit-taking, but has returned to its original state due to purchases. It is advisable to purchase when prices fall (cotton). The grain market is stable today due to high prices and the extension of the strike to the gauze industry. Texas is still without rain, and the market seems to be higher (rubber). Today's market is not very colorful. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Because the Shu gang bought a lot in the afternoon market yesterday, and the American cotton situation is still good, the longs' intentions are getting stronger. However, the Japanese short sellers have no intention of covering, and the current month's yarn price is flattened with the spot yarn price on the market. There are still more than 30,000 pieces of yarn in the warehouse, and the current receivers have not yet decided. Therefore, the near-month market is quite weak, and the far-month market is affected. However, the spot yarn sales are good, and the market price may be difficult to fall sharply. However, the far-term price is too high, and short-term swaps seem to be dominant.</p>

<p>Before the opening of the auction yarn market, American cotton rebounded by 20 pound notes, and the Sichuan gang bought more than 1,000 bales in the after-market yesterday. Most people expected a rise of several jiao. However, the market situation in the current month was weak, falling by two jiao, and the middle month also fell, but the bulls held the far month steady. As the auction went to the second and third rounds, it gradually weakened. Raw cotton fell, and the yarn market was affected. Some bulls also settled, and each month fell by six, eight, or nine jiao, but December fell by only one jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 22,100 bales. Check the sales: Deji 700 bales, Xinhua 900 bales, Yongchang 600, Xie Sheng 450 bales, Da Chang 450 bales, Xie Cheng 650 bales, Renfeng 1,950 bales, Jun Chang 800 bales, and Dafeng 900 bales.

<p>There has been no rain in the Yangtze River basin for a long time, and most rivers and streams have dried up. Fields and crops cannot be planted, and those that have been planted have no way to irrigate and can only watch them wither and die. This year's autumn harvest is expected to be poor. However, this concerns the grain situation in the winter of this year and next year, and seems to have little relationship with the current food situation. However, grain merchants and wealthy merchants who have nowhere to use their money are taking advantage of the opportunity to raise grain prices sharply and collect extensively (when new rice entered the market last winter, large merchants and wealthy people believed that rice prices had no hope and were unwilling to hoard them, so rice prices could not be maintained). A speculative fever for grain products has been triggered. Therefore, rice merchants are smiling, while farmers are still frowning. It is important to know that changes in prices cannot escape the laws of supply and demand. The characteristic of Chinese people is to be unprepared in peacetime and panic in times of trouble. Therefore, they are easily used and manipulated by merchants. If the provincial and county governments in the rice-producing areas can truly think about the people's livelihood and cooperate closely to investigate the amount of rice and grain in stock and compile relatively reliable statistics, and then formulate practical and feasible regulatory measures, it is believed that there will not be a severe shortage. However, if it is said but not done, and the market fabricates seemingly true but actually false words, grain prices will rise and fall accordingly. Recently, grain speculation has become increasingly large and has a profound impact on people's livelihood. Those who have relations with foreign rice are taking advantage of it to promote tax-free movements, which has become the most relevant slogan of the times. Observing the stability of the market once foreign rice is secured, it can be seen that the initial panic was purely driven by psychological factors and had nothing to do with the quality of the goods. It is believed that consecutive years of good harvests in the country have both promoted the fall in grain prices and led to the bankruptcy of rural areas, which is difficult to recover. Now, due to a month of drought, the bankruptcy of rural areas has become even more serious. However, the accumulation of grain in various places and the hoarding and speculation of large households are adding to the drought or even rejoicing in misfortune and refusing to release grain. Therefore, the current plan is to first provide relief by selling existing grain at fair prices, and to limit speculative activities. It is important not to see a drought and immediately secure foreign rice without detailed investigation, which would cause more trouble to rural areas.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Hexia Rice Market <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 20 ships arrived in Hunan, Shanghai (about 3,000 shi), and sales in various places. The initial market seemed slightly more active, and the local areas were actively purchasing. The Qingdao gang purchased more than 300 bags of late rice, and the situation seemed good. However, the weather suddenly changed, with overcast skies and sudden showers. It had not rained for seven or eight days, but it rained once, and the rice market, which had been firm due to drought, immediately became fatigued. The prices of thick japonica and late rice, which had opened high, continued to fall by one or two jiao. Only Du Yangjian and Yinyuan, due to a shortage of goods, remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Hubai Rice Market <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were more than ten sources. Although there were few boats in Hexia, sales of various goods were bland. The market was stable for high-quality white rice, while medium-quality rice was fatigued by one or two jiao. Early thin rice was stagnant, with a price of two jiao lower. White yuan and various tips were fatigued.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Foreign Basmati Rice <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>Local hoarders are still keen to purchase, and the mainland and Chongming continue to pack and load. The city opened with 2,000 bags of small rice and more than 5,700 bags of machine-processed brown rice. However, the selling price has fallen by two, three, or four jiao, because the previous rise was too high. Once an accident occurs, the market immediately reverses. The weather has changed, with timely rain falling in the mainland and producing areas. Even this city had a light rain yesterday. The heat has subsided and people's hearts are also firm. Hoarders are selling back, and buyers are not as poor as they were a few days ago. The city stocks medium-grade rice and are willing to devalue prices to sell. A large amount of foreign rice has already been ordered, and negotiations are still ongoing yesterday. Although the market has not announced it, several thousand tons have been agreed upon. However, the prime minister sold long-grain Saigon, with a price of 4.5 yuan per 100 jin including fees, plus tariffs. Sellers thought it was too expensive and did not succeed, so the market has fallen and may be able to level off somewhat in the after-market.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Flour Market Opening <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>All months showed a uniform downward trend. Foreign wheat was quoted with Chicago down a little 12/100ths and Canada down a little 48/100ths. When the market opened, the weather suddenly turned cool, with overcast skies suggesting that rain might soon be seen in the local area. News that soaking rain had fallen in various locations, including Beijing and Zhenjiang, had eased the anxiety of those who had been worried. Moreover, since the soaring grain prices had prompted the industry to start ordering foreign wheat as a means of emergency relief, it was hoped that the price of rice could gradually be brought down. All of these factors acted like a dose of cooling powder amidst the feverish clamor. Consequently, the opening price was soft, dropping nearly a cent. Later, due to heavy long positions, there was quite a bit of pullback. Many small holders also eagerly sold off their holdings, leading to pervasive selling pressure and declines across all boards. As for spot prices in Tianjin, there was initial excitement, followed by a retreat. "Cannon Cart" was quoted at 4.40 yuan and "Green Boat" at 4.20 yuan. Later telegraphs indicated that prices might continue to fall. As a result, this month's contract fell 2.5 cents, August fell a little 2.5 cents, September and October fell a little 3 cents, November fell a little 3.5 cents, and December fell a little 3 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Wheat Futures Market <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>After the morning opening, the market for all months showed a uniformly declining trend. Foreign wheat quotations showed Chicago and Canada down a little 48/100ths to 12/100ths. This situation was unrelated to the market's ups and downs. The sudden easing of anxiety was because the local area was likely to see rain, Beijing and Zhenjiang had received welcome rain, and there was renewed activity in the market for foreign wheat. Therefore, as soon as the longs were active, the market saw a soft decline. However, this kind of big rise and small pullback was probably not a truly small situation. It would require soaking rain across the drought-stricken areas and genuine orders for wheat to truly suppress the frenzy. As a result, this month's contract was unchanged, August fell a little 3 cents, September fell a little 4 cents, October fell a little 6 cents, and November and December fell a little 4 cents. The current wheat spot market is still seeing a steady flow of arrivals. Standard flour wheat has also seen declines. Opening prices for all grades have fallen back 3 to 4 cents. Opening prices were: Bengbu, Wuhe, and Suzhou wheat at 3.27 yuan, Mingguang wheat at 3.25 yuan, Shandong wheat at 3.29 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 3.24 yuan, Jiangjiazhen wheat at 3.18 yuan, Liuhe wheat at 3.14 yuan, Linhuai Pass wheat at 3.25 yuan, Wuhu wheat at 3 yuan, and Bianjiang wheat at 2.80 yuan. A total of 55,000 bags were opened, reportedly bought by Fuxin, Fufeng, and Xinda.</p>

<p>Recently, the red sorghum market has been quite firm, mainly because both rice and wheat prices have risen, tightening the finances of Zhejiang wine distilleries, whose inventories are low and supplies are scarce. Yesterday, the market opened with two truckloads of red-husk sorghum, priced at 2.50 yuan, and one truckload of flushed red-husk sorghum, with a price of 2.42 yuan agreed upon. Yesterday, the soybean market saw a sudden surge in oilcake demand due to a slight rain in the local area, which was expected to bring soaking rain to the surrounding countryside. Total market transactions for both futures and spot oilcake were estimated at around 40,000 pieces, causing the market to rise by 1 to 2 cents and boosting confidence. The market opened with two truckloads of Zhengyangguan soybeans, priced at 3 yuan and 2.97 yuan respectively, and one truckload of Feihe soybeans, priced at 2.90 yuan, which were distributed to local merchants and retailers. Factories bought 7-8 truckloads of Yingzhou soybeans, priced from 2.73 to 2.70 yuan. Another truckload of Suzhou soybeans was priced at 2.66 yuan. Over 1,500 bags of Guide soybeans were sold at 2.80 yuan. The soybean market in Jiujiang's Xinchengmen saw stability, with high-quality soybeans even better than the first batch, priced at 3.40 yuan. Ningbo merchants bought over 60 bags, while local merchants bought over 100 bags of medium to high-grade goods, priced at 3.30 yuan.</p>

<p>After rising for three or four consecutive days, the cotton market saw a sudden reversal in the past two days. Although foreign cotton remained firm, the local market, which had not seen rain on the 28th, suddenly declined. However, the rainfall was not thorough. According to various sources, there were only showers, slightly easing anxieties. In addition, 140,000 bales of American cotton were arriving in Shanghai in succession, and the long cotton companies were delivering the goods they had previously purchased in the July-August period in full. As a result, market sentiment was particularly weak, and the distant months were also affected.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Prices of Old and New Biao Cotton Fall by About Half a Yuan Each <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>The Biao cotton market opened with decent sentiment, as American and Indian cotton markets were trending upward. However, there was a lack of buyers in the market, and there was ample supply of delivery warrants for this month. The market quickly turned downward. As for distant-month new cotton, various sources reported many showers, and the local climate also showed signs of changing. Moreover, over 100,000 bales of American cotton were being imported in these few days. All these factors hindered the cotton market's rise, so market prices fell smoothly.

<p>The first batch of over 150 boxes of new Jinshan dried lychees have reportedly been sold out yesterday. Due to the small quantity, the market is quite brisk. The highest price opened at 48.80 yuan, then down to 40.50 yuan. The third batch of new Haikou lychees has been loaded onto the Qingyuan wheel at the source, but the quantity is only about 400 boxes, so the price is still expected to be firm. The first batch of Lanzhu and Wuye lychees is expected to open today. Since the emergence of new wood ear, the source has been blocked by water, and land prices have risen by 5-6 yuan. The local market prices have also risen accordingly. Top-grade Dingsheng Aviation small-package wood ear has risen to 94 yuan, and large-package assorted wood ear is 90 to 88 yuan. New Hengzhou lotus seeds have debuted at the source, with the Hankou first-grade price opening at 39.20 yuan and the second-grade price opening at 37.60 yuan. The first batch also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, with a cost of about 43 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local tea market, foreign firms were actively procuring Qimen and Ningzhou black teas from Lianghu and other regions.

As for the green tea market, there were no major changes. Only Gongxi green tea saw increased purchases by Persian merchants due to demand from abroad. The highest price opened at 100 yuan. High-grade Zhuang goods from Wuyuan's Eastern Route also had a top price of 120 yuan. Judging from the current market situation, high-quality green tea prices are still stable.</p>

<h3 id="e277">Preaching to Prisoners in Xuanhua <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>It was reported earlier that the Chinese Buddhist Association sent a letter to Justice Minister Ju Juegong, proposing to send personnel to prisons to preach to prisoners: "Before 1927, prisons in various provinces all had instructors, mostly Buddhist followers... The results were remarkable. Later, due to frequent turmoil, this practice could not be implemented. People are mostly indifferent to Buddhism when they are in good circumstances; they only become aware after suffering setbacks. When someone is imprisoned, the enlightening influence of Buddhism should be applied promptly to help them repent, which is more effective. Even after they are released from prison, they can be good citizens of society. Considering this, the association has already petitioned your office to instruct the courts of all provinces, cities, and counties to allow Buddhist organizations to select and send teachers to prisons to spread Buddhism for enlightenment... If you grant your approval, the benefits to prisoners will be limitless."</p>
<p>Buddhist followers aim to transcend humanity and deliver all living beings. Their divine grace even extends to prisoners in prisons, the gathering place for "evil men" and "rebellious elements," which can only be considered immeasurable merit. We see that Christianity in Western Europe heavily promotes its "ointment that doesn't reach the hand" to many prisoners, sending them to the killing field with a cross, which are all practical expressions of making prisoners "repent." Now, in this time of social unrest and many criminals, the Buddhist Association has come to blow its "dharma conch" again. First, it says that timely enlightenment is more effective, and second, it says that helping them repent can make them good citizens. A heart of helping the world and saving people leaps onto the paper. However, the connection to the path is shallow for the impure, and questions must arise.</p>
<p>First of all, I certainly cannot but admit that if all living beings in the world advocated purity, non-action, and non-competition, the result would naturally be a reduction in worldly evils, and everyone would be a "good citizen of society." However, because human beings are born imperfect due to God's creation, they have the requirements of food, clothing, and shelter and various desires. These things are exclusively occupied by a small number of people. To strive for these things to maintain survival leads to the formation of society as a battlefield of life, producing infinite "evils." If these requirements cannot be obtained properly, the source of "evil" will exist in society one day. If Buddhist followers who are concerned about saving the world want to enlighten them and make them aware, teaching them to tighten their belts, not wear clothes, and lie on the ground may lead them to "repent."</p>
<p>As for the so-called criminals who are mostly indifferent to Buddhism when they are in good circumstances and only become aware after suffering setbacks, they are mostly military men and politicians who have lost power. When they are imprisoned, they may convert to Buddhism. However, once they are free, they will rise again and reorganize their old businesses. Their belief in "great compassion" is only a temporary "hiding" to avoid the storm. It cannot be treated the same as those who are driven to crime by the need for food and clothing after their release from prison. Even if those "desperate" prisoners may become aware and repent due to "timely enlightenment" while imprisoned, they probably cannot solve their real problems by simply following the master's teachings when they are forced by hunger and cold after serving their sentences. At that time, the Buddhist prison instructor's hope for good citizens of society will no longer be "the benefits to prisoners will be limitless."</p>
<p>Originally, religion is a vain and unfounded thing. It not only passively spreads illusions that distance people from reality but also actively compensates for sins and conceals peace. The more unstable society is, the stronger the environment that drives people to "evil" is, and the more it takes this opportunity to spread the seeds of "non-non realms." Passively, it pulls people into a realm of emptiness and vastness. Actively, it tries its best to cover up the source of social evils, blurring the path for people to seek survival, advancement, and social transformation. Therefore, although prisoners in national prisons may repent after being enlightened by Buddhism, they still have the problem of eating and clothing after their release. To make them "good citizens," it is definitely not about converting to Buddhism but about having a real understanding of society and striving for it. Otherwise, the so-called "preaching" is an act of teaching people to repent to Tathagata on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>— Ling Yu</p>
<p>After rushing around for a day under the scorching sun, I returned home when the lights were on.</p>
<p>"It's cool today, how come you're only back now?" This was my aunt, in whose house I was lodging, asking me.</p>
<p>"Because there was a risk of problems with my job, I went to see my uncle," I answered, exhausted and panting. "It's really cool here today," I said again, sitting on a stool by the windy doorway.</p>
<p>"Today is French Revolution Day, there's a lantern parade; there are also fireworks, a musical band, and all kinds of lanterns in the French Park. It's very lively outside. We went last year." My aunt said to me excitedly.</p>
<p>"I can't go, I need to take a bath and then rest, you guys go," I replied.</p>
<p>The dinner that had been prepared long ago was eaten quickly. My aunt and the five members of her family all tidied themselves up to go see the excitement.</p>
<p>"We'll see something good, don't regret it!" My aunt still wanted to tempt me to go with her as she left.</p>
<p>"I won't regret it," I answered simply.</p>
<p>They left, and the room was quiet, with only me left. The evening breeze was even cooler. I put a rattan chair on the balcony, lay down barefoot and with bare arms, watching the twinkling stars in the sky and listening to the distant sounds of the city. In such a cool and quiet twilight, I felt at ease. Suddenly, as if I couldn't bear the loneliness, I got up, went out, and caught up with my aunt and the others, but they weren't heading towards the French Park. They were walking down a road I had never known before. I asked my aunt in surprise:</p>
<p>"What is this place? Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Don't you recognize this as XX Road?" 'Where are you going?' you ask even more strangely. Isn't today our country's Revolution Day? XX Association is holding a grand ceremony and a grand celebration. Look, aren't all the people going to participate in this grand event?" My aunt said, pointing to one side with her finger.</p>
<p>Following her finger, I saw a tall building with our country's national flag flying brightly in the wind. A wave of cheers from the people and generous and majestic music came from that side. I was a little confused.</p>
<p>"During the day, weren't all the shops, buses, and a few private cars flying the tricolor flag of red, white, and blue? Why have they all changed to our national flag now?" I murmured softly.</p>
<p>"Are there still tricolor flags? This is our national territory," my aunt said when she heard my words.</p>
<p>"Isn't this the French Concession?" I asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"You're a complete fool! That was decades ago. Our national territory is our domain. Since that revolution, all the unequal treaties have been abolished, the concessions have been recovered, and the tariffs are autonomous. In short, we occupy the same position as other powerful countries on Earth. For this great revolution, we are commemorating it today with such cheers everywhere," my aunt said proudly.</p>
<p>I thought silently that the things during the day were said to be decades ago, and the memorial day of another country was said to be our memorial day. Why was my aunt lying to me like this today? I asked stutteringly.</p>
<p>"I knew it was French during the day..."</p>
<p>"No need to say it, come with us, you will naturally know when you get there. Do you definitely like to see the memorial day of a foreign country, but don't want to participate in such a great memorial festival of our own!" She said as she walked triumphantly.</p>
<p>I was confused and happy again, and I followed them while involuntarily saying in a voice full of joy: "This is a great memorial day, this is a memorial day worth commemorating!"</p>
<p>"Sleeping here, don't catch a cold," my aunt said softly, pushing my shoulder.</p>
<p>I rubbed my eyes, the starlight was above my head, and the sounds of the city were echoing in the distance. I was still lying in the rattan chair. I dragged my shoes lazily into my room, fell on the bed, but my heart was still beating non-stop, a kind of relief, a kind of joy, and my mouth was still murmuring: "A great memorial day, a memorial day worth commemorating."</p>

<h3 id="e279">The Secret of Longevity of the Kerosene King <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>John D. Rockefeller, whom many call the "Kerosene King" in America, is one of the world's richest men. The other day was his ninety-fifth birthday. The family celebration was held at his former residence on Lake Lake in New York State. Mr. Rockefeller likes to play golf, and he believes that golf is the secret to longevity.</p>
<p>"Money can't buy a way out of the underworld," although there was this saying in ancient times, Yama, the god of death, will still take some personal feelings into account. People with money will definitely have power. Although this path cannot be bought, "deferred execution" can always be arranged.</p>
<p>Mr. Rockefeller said that golf is the secret to longevity. I dare not believe it. If that were the case, then golf can prolong life and benefit health. Even playing golf on the table can make you live ten or eight years longer. No wonder there are golf injury facilities in several large gardens. Presumably, it is the intention of inviting some old masters, young masters, ladies and young ladies who visit the garden to increase their years.</p>
<p>However, people with money are always broad-minded and content. They always feel comfortable. They can do whatever they like. This is the origin of longevity. If you like sailing, sailing is the secret to longevity. If you like horse racing, horse racing is the secret to longevity. If you like dancing, dancing is also the secret to longevity. If you like gambling, gambling is also the secret to longevity. There are many secrets to longevity for people with money, not just golf.</p>
<p>As long as you have money, living in a loft is like roasting a field frog in such hot weather. You keep complaining, but people with money and power not only live in tall foreign houses but also want to be comfortable and go to famous mountains and scenic spots to escape the summer heat. This kind of body will live at least eight hundred years longer.</p>
<h3 id="e280">The Last Letter <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Shu</p>
<p>Qinmei's mother died, not long ago, but when her mother was dying, she was working somewhere. I know very well that she must have been very sad about her mother's death. Why shouldn't she be? She wanted an independent life, she wanted to break free from the shackles of her family, no, more importantly, she wanted to stay away from her hometown to avoid marrying that hooligan-like fiancé. So she struggled in the yarn factory, enduring her gloomy years like a cow or a horse.</p>
<p>I haven't received her letter for almost five months, needless to say, this made me very worried. But a week ago, I received her death letter. Ah! A young girl actually wrote such a letter. Her letter read like this.</p>
<p>...Sister Shan: Do you remember? It has been more than two years since we separated. But, Sister Shan, in these two years, I have suffered all the pain of life in the world. Sister Shan, I used to believe that I could drift like this. But, until now, I deeply feel that all the pain has completely shattered my courage to struggle. Isn't it? A week ago, I still thought so, I always held on to my indomitable ambition to gain light in the dark society, and always looked forward to the day when I would cut down the demons and kill them happily, so I desperately sacrificed everything to move forward, but now everything makes me despair, ah! I recall the pain of the past, sadness and despair, I feel that my heart has been shattered. At this time, my heart hurts as if it is being bitten by a demon, but I have to endure the pain to finish this letter, ah! Sister Shan, I can't help but shed sad tears.</p>
<p>Sister Shan, now I can't bear the pain to move forward anymore, let me tell you: I endured the humiliation and did the hard work in that hellish yarn factory for a year, how fierce and vicious the foreman was, how terrible his face was, he could simply swallow me at any time. From morning to night, I couldn't see the sky, I couldn't see the sun, and there was no moment for you to rest. Sister Shan, my fragile body is naturally inevitable to get sick in such a cruel hell on earth. When I was sick, of course I couldn't go to work anymore, so I had to live in that pigeon cage-like attic for a week. Sister Shan, all my clothes and bedding... have been pawned, but I still haven't paid this month's rent. Sister Shan, it turns out that people's hearts in the world are as black as coal! Seeing that I was so poor and sick, the landlord kicked me out today. At that time, I only knew how to cry sadly, and I didn't know where to go. Suddenly, it seemed that my mother was guiding me in front. Sister Shan, I often saw my mother's dark shadow in the moment of dizziness. So, I turned sorrow into joy, and slowly walked through the bustling place with weak feet and walked to a secluded place, oh! I arrived at my place of rest, and the death-like loneliness was embracing me. Sister Shan, my mother has been waiting for me for a long time. Now I am using a pencil to write this last letter to you under the dim light of the street lamp. If you can receive it, then it will be my greatest wish, because you are the only one in the world who truly understands me. I have to bless you in the dark. Sister Shan, goodbye forever...</p>
<p>Shanghai Has No Summer</p>
<h3 id="e281">"Prostitute Bargain" and "Ruthless" <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yang</p>
<p>Modern commercial operations, due to the shocks of trends, have mostly abandoned their concept of "genuine and unwavering prices." They also deeply understand that advertising and promotion, with their extensive influence, are indeed the strongest weapons in commercial warfare, embodying the idea that "with these to conquer enemies, no enemy cannot be destroyed" and "with these to achieve success, no achievement is unattainable." I remember when my family lived in Tianjin, I often saw shops in both the Chinese and foreign concessions of Tianjin, when they reduced prices to sell goods, some published announcements in newspapers, some distributed leaflets, and some hung various slogans at their doors. The simple slogans that caught the eye and caused surprise were mostly "Hurry up! Big Bargain!" and "Risk it all! Clearing Stock!" We won't discuss whether they were "truly hurrying" or "truly risking it," or whether they were using the old trick of "the wool comes from the sheep." In short, it belongs to competitive business and can be called "bitter operation." Although there are some flashy tricks, as long as the intention is predictable, it seems that commercial ethics have not been lost. Moreover, personal stakes are involved, so how could anyone truly willingly sell at a loss? If that were the case, wouldn't those wealthy merchants have to bring their wives and children, preparing for losses, and wouldn't all the employees of the shop also have to suffer? And why are some department stores opening grandly today, and some limited companies establishing and opening tomorrow? Since they are not fools, throwing capital casually into a void, we can also understand everything!</p>
<p>However, the meanings of advertising slogans like "Hurry up!" and "Risk it all!" are vivid and expressive, truly filled with the local color of Tianjin and worth our appreciation and study.</p>
<p>Recently, I suddenly saw a long rectangular red sign in front of a shop on Stone Road in this city, with two conspicuous black characters: "Prostitute Bargain." This couldn't help but make me suspicious, as it seemed like the northern wind was gradually blowing south, carrying a genuine Tianjin flavor. Could it be that the shop owner is a "Tianjin talker"? However, the word "prostitute" is a taboo in the north, especially when speaking to women. Now this shop is not only "bargaining," but still insists on adding a "prostitute." Although it is speaking to buying and selling goods, to show genuine price reductions and treating customers with sincerity, as if there is nothing more to say. However, if we carefully savor these two characters, "Prostitute Bargain," we suddenly feel a strange interest and can't help but laugh!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, things in the world often happen in pairs. Yesterday, I suddenly discovered a summer sale advertisement from a Tianjin shop in the Tianjin Dagongbao. It started by placing the two large characters "Ruthless" above the shop's name. I guess the reason for their "ruthlessness" is nothing more than standing on the same front as "Hurry up!" and "Risk it all!" to express their willingness to lose money and promote goods. The wonderful thing is that "Prostitute Bargain" and "Ruthless," from the north and south, echo each other from afar, and I discovered them one after another. A careful appreciation is also a good way to escape the summer heat. Because this kind of thought-provoking article is most likely to make your heart cool!</p>
<p>But there is one thing: if we take a broad view of the dumping policies of Japan and Soviet Russia in their trade with China, they are also "prostitute bargain" and "ruthless," only seeking to sell goods smoothly, regardless of losses. They are of course carrying a political background and implementing their economic invasion, eventually having a day of harvest, which is probably the so-called "fragrant bait to catch golden turtles," luring you to take the bait. Only this kind of "prostitute bargain" can be called truly "ruthless"!</p>
<h3 id="e282">Sincerity Works Miracles <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>The Panchen Lama met with reporters in Beijing the day before yesterday and expressed the following opinions:</p>
<p>"The south is suffering from severe drought. I sent ten lamas to Qixia Mountain in Nanjing to pray for rain, and as a result, there was heavy rain for two hours. Later, I went to Baohua Mountain to pray for rain, and there was heavy rain for two days."</p>
<p>The Panchen Lama's magic is boundless, and I think his way of praying for rain is just a small part of his skill.</p>
<p>The gentry and merchants of Shanghai saw that there had been no rain for more than twenty days, which led to soaring rice prices and rampant epidemics. Heaven has the virtue of loving life, so they respectfully set up an altar in the Siming Guild Hall to pray for rain. This is different from the Panchen Lama's prayer for rain.</p>
<p>The Panchen Lama relies on Buddhism, so he is so confident. As for the four attendants who died suddenly in the car when the Lama went to Beijing, that was predestined before birth, and Buddhism could not save them. The gentry and merchants of Shanghai relied entirely on a sincere heart to pray for rain, so-called "sincerity works miracles." Sure enough, there was drizzle at noon today (the 17th), although not "heavy," it is also "precious"!</p>
<h3 id="e283">Children <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Baishe</p>
<p>They are as lively as little birds, as happy as little birds, shouting and singing like little birds, these innocent and lovely children.</p>
<p>Children are running, jumping, and playing in the garden. I always like to stand at the window of the building behind the garden and watch. The children are focused on playing and don't realize that someone is envying them, which brings a smiling melancholy.</p>
<p>The children's bodies are naturally given to them for activity, never willing to stop for a moment, and the laughter in their mouths never stops. They turn, crawl, and slide from the slide, like a large group of noisy sparrows in the forest in the morning. Although they also cry, their crying does not carry human suffering, only for a small and ridiculous reason. But soon they will be crying and laughing again.</p>
<p>Seeing these children playing unrestrainedly and heartily, I can't help but feel a light feeling in my heart. So I ran downstairs, stepping and jumping, and walked to the middle of the children. The children are not afraid of me, they think I am a companion of the same age as them, and they do not feel uncomfortable because of my joining. My heart feels a burst of joy, because the fact proves that I am still a naughty child, yes, I am still a child, a child.</p>
<p>Since I regard myself as a child, I am willing to do anything that children play. Rolling on the ground, shouting, somersaulting, everything is the same as the children, but the only difference from the children is that I know it myself. Because every time I jump, I feel that my legs are stiff. Although things that children do without effort, I feel heavy, my joints are clumsy, and my posture is unnatural. But since the children do not regard me as someone other than a child, and I still retain a little of the child's component, this point seems to be quite comforting.</p>
<p>"Good child, give me a kiss." The child does not need to worry, puts two bright red little lips close to my mouth, leaving a moist imprint, but he looks at the short mustache on my lips with round and large black eyes. So, I am sad, I know that this stinging thing has made the child's tender skin feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The sun is down, the children tear, shout, and scream, as if a large group of small birds have flown away, they jump and laugh. They did not invite me to go with them. So I stayed alone in the garden, coldly, jump, my legs are so clumsy, sing, what to sing? I touched the short mustache on my lips with one hand and pondered alone. Clearly the children have abandoned me, pray to heaven, can you turn me back ten years?</p>
<p>Yes, I have been away from the children for ten years.</p>

<p>— Translated by Hungarian Yuri Bakirojia</p>
<p>A man stood in the center of the house. His face was painful and desperate. One hand held a letter, the other a repeating pistol. He was so deeply immersed in his grief that he did not notice that someone was standing behind him.</p>
<p>He raised the hand with the pistol, and in that instant, he was affectionately embraced—a pair of white arms. He suddenly turned his head.</p>
<p>"You? Alice, is that you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's me!"</p>
<p>This sudden surprise stopped his mouth. The girl took the pistol from his hand with a sad smile and threw it on the table.</p>
<p>After a long silence, the man spoke.</p>
<p>"Why did you come?"</p>
<p>"Because I love you."</p>
<p>"I don't understand... You love me, but tomorrow you are going to marry another man."</p>
<p>"Because I should... Because they forced me... My father's life depends on all this..."</p>
<p>"Then why did you come?"</p>
<p>The girl said lowly, holding the repeating pistol:</p>
<p>"I foresaw this."</p>
<p>"Then, you came to stop me... Alice!"</p>
<p>The girl stammered almost awkwardly:</p>
<p>"No... Just for this... I came..."</p>
<p>"But...?"</p>
<p>Her forehead blushed.</p>
<p>"Can't you guess?"</p>
<p>"No. I haven't thought of..."</p>
<p>The girl ran over and hid her purple face on the man's chest, whispering only what his ear could hear:</p>
<p>"I am willing... I am willing to be... Yours..."</p>

<p>— Suyin</p>
<p>By now, a film actor has reached the point where they cannot tell the truth and have to lie. Telling the truth in a down-to-earth manner is too ordinary for the audience. They must follow the audience's psychology, say what they like to hear, and what they like to hear is nothing more than empty, romantic stories. The reason why the American boxing king Cunnington is not popular with the public, although his name is known to all women and children in the country, is because he is too honest and not romantic enough. He is too loyal to the audience, and he does not know how to deceive them a little to please them. He often tells people: "The reason why I want to box with people is entirely for money. When I have money, I will not box, but stay at home comfortably drinking hot milk and reading Shakespeare." Alas, for the sake of money! Drinking milk? Reading Shakespeare! That is so lacking in romantic flavor! If he said, "I am for fame! When I succeed, I will travel around the world and compete with the strong men of various countries!" Or say, "I am going to England to teach the Prince of Wales to box!" Then everyone would applaud thunderously.</p>
<p>Raymond Navarro is a very kind person. You can invite him to drink, and he can drink cup after cup without refusing. He also likes to be sociable and have fun. If you invite him to a banquet, wherever there are sweet women and soft music, he will be there. And before the night is over, he must sing a "Sweet Antriline" or play a piece on the piano to be considered a complete evening. Raymond has many ways to entertain, but what is circulated among the "people" is only one kind of his "good at singing." Everything else is not convenient to say, and dare not say, why say things that offend the public? It is even more unnecessary to say that some people publicize him like a missionary, saying that he likes to sing hymns, etc., praising him as if he were a white dove among a group of crows. The same is true for Joan Crawford. If you are not afraid of being scolded, you can say that Joan likes to go out at night: she often dances and seeks pleasure outside all night long; she likes to dance Charleston and all kinds of romantic and unrestrained behaviors. Because what the public knows is that Joan Crawford is a person with "ambition greater than everything else"! She works hard all day long; she overcomes all difficulties; she is a person who is always fighting with the environment!</p>
<p>There is also a person who is "always fighting with the environment," that is, Jean Harlow. The newspapers have publicized her as if she were the most unfortunate person in the world, so thousands of viewers shed tears of sympathy for her. Her first husband was too young; her second husband was too old. They died, committed suicide, leaving a pitiful little widow, and she is still struggling hard! Yes, she is the bravest woman ever. If you say something else, you have to be careful that people who are superstitious about Harlow hear you!</p>
<p>The love triangles that have occurred in Hollywood, not to say that the world has never seen, even the residents of Hollywood are almost speechless. The triangle between Chaderton, Brent, and Debs made people dizzy and unable to approach. Ruth Chaderton divorced Ralph Forbes and married George Brent; but Ruth still kept in constant contact with Ralph. Recently, Ruth is going to divorce George again and return to Ralph. How do you think a husband should be, how should a good friend be, how should a friend also be a husband, how should a husband become a friend? Can this problem be solved in trigonometry? But everyone knows that Ruth Chaderton is a highly educated and morally noble person. They don't even know that she likes to chew gum, and they don't want to know.</p>
<p>In Lincoln's time, the United States did not have movies. At that time, people's hearts may have been different from now. Worshiping hypocrisy, escaping reality, and not wanting to know the real situation, willing to comfort oneself with falsehood, these are all characteristics of modern people, which Lincoln did not anticipate.

<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e286">Review of "Dragon Horse Swordsman" <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Flaming Guns 丨 New Light</p>
<p>Probably people who often watch American movies all know that there is a horse called Tony and a person called Tom Mix. He and it often rush back and forth on the screen. Now Tony is dead, and all that is left is Tom Mix. However, he has no opponent, so he found another horse and named it Little Tony. It appeared in "Dragon Horse Swordsman."</p>
<p>However, we are really tired of watching this kind of play.</p>
<p>Western filmmakers have long had a model. Every Western film just needs to be taken out of this stereotype, which is very convenient. However, because of this, we are really tired of watching it. It is always the same set of things.</p>
<p>The old story, the old directing techniques, almost do not need to be re-examined. Anyway, it is just this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Like this kind of Western film, it should not exist now.</p>
<p>But some people say that Western films are only for the little people to vent their anger. The reason is that the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, because they have suffered various oppressions, like to watch these films. So we (referring to we intellectuals) do not need to demand the correct "consciousness" of the works, anyway, it is just for the "little people" to watch. However, this point is not something we dare to agree with. Precisely because Western films are welcomed by the general audience with low intellectual standards, precisely because the scenes of fighting and excitement suit their tastes, precisely because Western films are close to their lives, so we demand the authors of Western films even more urgently, there must be correct content in them, and then they can become film works that are beneficial to the "little people."</p>
<p>Moreover, when we criticize a film work, we never stand only on the position of our few people. On the contrary, our demands must become the demands of the general audience. Do you mean to say that we audience should exclude the "little people"? To say it again, our opinions are the opinions of the general audience.</p>
<p>Why shouldn't Western films have new content? Assuming that the unique film form has to continue to exist. For example, what is popular now is heroes and good men, eliminating violence and bringing peace, and finally marrying beauties to end, then we can also attack individual heroism, make the oppressed masses fight for justice, eliminate hooligans and gangsters, and even eliminate corrupt officials. There can also be fighting scenes, and there can also be riding horses and galloping. Why can't it be welcomed by the general "little people" audience?</p>
<p>We are not against the form of Western films, but we have to demand new content. This is our conclusion.</p>

<h3 id="e288">Chinese Music and Film <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Shuai</p>
<p>"Sculpture," "painting," and "music" are, strictly speaking, the main tools for promoting the "cultural juggernaut." These arts can give "humanity" great benefits in indirect and direct ways.</p>
<p>Speaking of the above few, the most backward in China is of course "music." Whether it is folk or stage, what is played is only some extremely monotonous "melodies." The dull "rhythm" that has remained unchanged for thousands of years is forever pressing down on the talented, with no day to raise their heads!</p>
<p>"Instrumental music" is also very simple and crude in China. What about "vocal music"? A man with a naturally thick vocal cord insists on singing Qingyi Huashan with a sharp voice; conversely, a woman breaks her throat to sing Da Hualian. Although my country's "Peking Opera" studies "diction," "intonation," "rhythm," and "beat," etc., and the West pays attention to "scales," "tempo," "dynamics," "beats," etc. in "singing," which are equally important; but without reality, it will not be able to move forward and lose the original effect and value of "music" and "life," isn't this drawback undeniable?</p>
<p>Since the infiltration of Westernization into the East, there has been considerable construction in singing; unfortunately, like a child with congenital deficiencies and a lack of growth ability, it has always been in its infancy, wasting its youth!</p>
<p>But my country's film has made special speed progress. Under the strict supervision of general critics, it is galloping forward like a fly. In the process of repeated changes, it has swallowed up the considerable power of the old drama, it has penetrated into the people, and it is almost about to rush into the ranks of world-famous films. Why can "Lullaby," "Come Back," and the recent "Fisherman's Song" become popular among the people in a short time? It is because it is a "movie song."</p>
<p>"Film" itself needs "music," and "music" can be spread through "film." Then the relationship between "music" and film is self-evident. At the same time, a heavy burden has been placed on the shoulders of those engaged in film.</p>
<p>In the past sound films, we have seen "Erhuang" and "Xipi" that have been moved from the stage to the screen, and "scandalous songs" that are equally popular among the people. But these are all undesirable old things.</p>
<p>The recent "Fisherman's Song" has changed its style, (such as the two sentences "fish are difficult to catch and boat rent is heavy, fishermen are poor for generations") which can truly grasp the center of consciousness and make the audience have infinite feelings. The words are also simple and easy to understand: but the "melody" is not very beautiful, but it is much better than other songs.</p>
<p>In addition, how should we build a new path for "film music"? Now, due to space limitations, we cannot discuss it in detail.</p>

<h3 id="e289">Princess Thirty Days (Thirty-Day Princess) (6) <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Que</p>
<p>Duke Nicholas was a simple-minded person. After hearing Gilke's words, he took Gilke to search Katherine's room in Glashin Building. In this search, Gilke found a book in the back of a drawer. He opened it and saw that it was nothing else but Naixue's notebook. This further proved that Princess Katherine was impersonated by Naixue, and York was even more ecstatic to get this true evidence. Nicholas was almost going crazy, but not as ecstatic as Gilke. He felt that this matter was very suspicious. He was also worried about the real Katherine. So he felt that he had to notify King Toronia. He made a long-distance call to the king. But Nicholas was a person with loose lips. Gilke, in order to prevent him from leaking the news and keep his secret, accompanied him east and west every day.</p>
<p>The trip of Wang Bao and others was scheduled for ten days. When they came back, the real Princess Katherine had recovered from her illness. The place where she lived was another floor in Glashin Building. The real princess then invited the fake princess to come and meet her. When Princess Catalina and Naixue met, the two looked at each other and found it difficult to distinguish each other, so they became very close to each other. The two of them rested together. One was called Xuexue, and the other was Naixue. The two of them eliminated the distinction between superior and inferior and directly addressed each other by their nicknames. Xuexue asked: "Have you seen Nicholas?" Naixue said with a sympathetic look, as if it was a pity that a fresh flower was inserted in a pile of dung, and told the princess everything about Madison and Bode. She also said: "Madison is a very good person. But Glashin hates him very much in his heart. Therefore, when the last dance party is held tomorrow night, I want to avenge him and send him a fake Baoxing··Send it to him··" Xuexue said: "Tomorrow night, I will participate in the last dance party myself." She also smiled mischievously and said: "Whether the treasure is a raw treasure star or not, I will arrange it. Naixue, okay?" Naixue agreed happily. Hua··Da··Da··Da··" The long trumpet was blowing. Princess Catalina. Theodoras. Maglita walked out gracefully and walked lightly to the end of the large ballroom to sit on the throne. She returned to Yiyan and said: "Before we say goodbye, we would like to express our gratitude to two great American people, one is Luculus. Mr. Glashin; and the other is Bode, Mr. Madison. We now respectfully present the highest honor Baoxing of our country to these two gentlemen." When the two gentlemen heard this, they immediately walked to the front of the princess. An attendant stood upright on the side, holding a brocade mat containing two Baoxing, one was a real Baoxing, and the other was an Iron Cross. Princess Catalina first took an Iron Cross and was about to pin it on for Glashin. Glashin hurriedly shouted in a low voice: "No, no··That one, that one··" He was still thinking that the princess was Naixue. But the princess ignored him and pinned a cross on him. The handsome young Bode, Madison, actually safely got a real Baoxing. (To be continued)</p>
