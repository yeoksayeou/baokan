<h3 id="c36">日本宣告廢除海約舒 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>廢除華盛頓倫敦兩海軍條約之舉。日本外交界初意。原擬先得英國之默認。並聯絡法意。採取一致廢約行動。詎意英國主張在與美國接近。以致聯英計劃。不能有成。法意兩國。尤不肯爲日本利益而取怨於英美。亦拒絶日本主張。於是日本外交。不得不重行考慮。欲卽行廢約。匪但對美將意見命深。英日政治上之合作。亦恐不易進展。掌握實權之軍部。又與彼政府主張不同。一般民衆。復多贊同軍部主張。遂不能待預備會談之結果。而逕主單獨宣告廢除海約矣。其廢除海約。已經日內閣會議决定。並傚退出國聯時舊例。諮請樞密院審議。此僅屬於行政手續問題。而於廢約之議。勢在必行。可斷言也。</p>
<p>日本認己國國力。已向外伸張。海上貿易。雖次於英美。但高於其他各國。遠東貿易市塲應當讓彼獨步。平等之海軍力。自爲理所當然者。然爲求英國諒解起見。事實上不能不承認英國海軍之優越。對美國實際上則非立於平等地位不可。宣告廢約之後。日本卽不受條約之束縛。第一。今後可依其所謂國防需要。增加意想中之海軍力。現時日本海軍。僅潛行艇居世界首位。然軍事專家常以爲此僅係防守武器。欲越太平洋五千浬之航程。以取攻勢。尙不可能。其次甲級巡洋艦如「那智」號較諸英美所有。亦占上風。惟數量甚少。噸位不大。勢不能超越巨大戰艦而上之。則是廢約以後。卽可將此類偏陂弊病。迅速補救。而自由擴張軍備矣。第二。華盛頓九國公約。固未能拘束日本之一切行動。但常爲國際間論爭之焦點。日本外交。屢受非難。國聯常借此引起若干外交波紋。設使英美諸國。果據以堅持遠東門户開放。則日本在東北之軍事行動。亦將有所牽制。以前英美各有懷抱。外交步調互異。日本乃可取得一部分利益。今後情勢。一旦變換。英美苟成立諒解。則日本困難驟增。爲日本計。固以廢約爲得也。</p>
<p>說者謂日本之所利。卽美國之所害。假令循日本主張。一一見諸實施。美國在遠東貿易。惟有聽日本之支配。而英國亦將漸退至新嘉坡以西。謹守印度。或者可以暫時相安。維持倖存之局面。然而彼北美合衆國者。非向海外開拓市塲。圖投資與輸出貿易之發展。决不能挽救其經濟上之危機。奠定將來繁榮之基礎。英國之於遠東。苦心經營已九十餘年。經濟根柢。旣相當穩固。政治勢力。亦自不弱。亦必不肯甘心放棄。以拱手聽命於人也。</p>
<p>日本旣宣告廢約。美國必抛棄華盛頓條約所賦予之義務。卽五五三比率之交換條件。建築菲利濱及關島軍事要塞是也。恐此後建艦競爭。必不能免。英美又皆深知今後海戰之重點。不在笨重之巨艦。而在動作敏捷之飛機。美國之飛行母艦。其搭載機數逾八十。航行速率每小時爲三十三浬。推爲當世第一。尤非日本之敵。日本在此情勢之下。自惟有擴充軍備。以擁護其利益而已。</p>

<p>海軍决維持對日優勢</p>
<p>研究日計劃再定進止</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美聯社今日得悉、國務院及海軍部準備於日本宣告廢約後、各謀應付辦法、惟預測取消條約未必卽引起造艦競爭、並信在日本政府宣告廢約後及條約期滿前二年之時期內、海軍方面大槪將岑寂一時、國務院方面現在竭力籌劃繼續海軍限制之辦法、海軍當局則擬乘機研究日本造艦計劃、以爲美國之張本、某負責方面今日告美聯社記者稱、如以戰艦之種類數目及大小而論、則所謂一九三六年後之美國造艦計劃、不過一時揣測、蓋造艦詳細辦法、須視他國計劃而定也、但若干美國海軍當局則信美國之造艦計劃、應着重建造航空母艦、水上飛機、及超速度重巡洋艦、致得與航空快艦並駕齊驅云、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）昨日美國海軍首席代表台維斯在倫敦發表宣言、謂日本宣告廢止華盛頓海約之後、影響所及、當由日本擔負責任、美國政府以爲台維斯雖發出此項警告、日本亦必於兩星期之內宣告廢止、至於應付方法、美國方面似不願操急行事、以致妨害日美兩國現行關係、或在世界上引起普遍之海軍競爭、官方人士一面堅决主張美國海軍有維持優勢之必要、一面聲明華府倫敦兩項海約、須俟至一九三六年底始乃實行失效、國務院與海軍部咸欲以此後兩年作爲海軍建造休戰時期、而在此時期內、益加奮勉、以期覓獲妥恊基礎、成立限制原則、並俟日本海軍建告程序辯明之後、始乃决定本國所應採取之程序、關於海軍競爭一層、日本大使齋藤曾在波士頓城發表演說、謂日本不欲出於此舉、此間人士甚爲滿意、以爲齋藤所言、係指日本至少在兩年之內、不欲與美國作海軍建造之競爭、舍此而外、美國政府並希望能於一九三五年之內、在較形順利之情况下、重作海軍談判、衆議院海軍委員會主席文生日昨宣言、日本廢止華府海約後、若建造主力艦三艘、則美國卽當建造五艘、藉以維持五·五·三、則有比率、聞維斯福總統左右不以此項宣言爲然、此間有人聲稱、海軍當道或立卽將開始建造軍艦七十八艘、以替換年齡届滿之軍艦、亦未可知、但明年一月國會開會時、政府未必提出重要造艦計劃至海軍部現行計畫其總數僅有二十四艘、但海軍界未必以此爲滿足其建艦熱、尙待羅斯福總統努力加以抑制云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3 id="c38">台維斯言論係屬私人性質 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>

<p>含有牽制日本意味</p>
<p>（倫敦）美代表台維斯於六日關於海軍問題、最初發表正式聲明對於各國海軍力一律縮减之再提案、英國政府對於質的限制、、已於七日宣明英國政府之立塲、特别關於主力艦·航空母艦·巡洋艦之最高單艦噸數、表示預備一律縮减三成、上項情形係對抗美國海軍長官史璜生之减少各國海軍力二成案、將英國所抱質的軍縮案之骨子明確表示、頗被一般人士所注目、同時作爲打開豫備會商僵局之唯一方案、對於日本要求提示具體方案之際、似含牽制之意味、茲將該項聲明之要旨錄於左、</p>
<p>英國政府素來反對主力艦及航空母艦巡洋艦等之過於擴大艦型、曾於日內瓦三國會議席上亦經提唱以上艦種之最高單艦噸數、須一律縮少三成、同時復有縮少備砲口徑之提案、英國政府更關於以上各種兵艦提案縮减最高單艦噸數、並擬於現在就此受諾、主要海軍國之大多數亦對於上項提案業經承認矣云云、（七日日聯電）</p>
<h3 id="c40">軍縮形成軍擴日反對英主張 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>（東京）英國政府發表聲明、主張對於戰鬥艦及航空母艦巡洋艦等之單艦噸數、一律减少三成、現在日本政府雖尙未接到正式電文、是以海軍當局亦未便公布其意見、但綜合海軍部內之意向、其大致情形如左、</p>
<p>（一）英國之一律减少三成案、其內容雖尙未探悉、但曾於日內瓦英美日三國會議席上、英國主張縮少單艦噸數、恐此次之主張亦然、英國曾在日內瓦會議係主張主力艦之最大噸數爲二萬五千噸、航空母艦爲二萬一千噸、巡洋艦爲七千噸、與現存條約上之噸數比較之下、其主力艦規定以三萬五千噸爲限、航空母艦二萬七千噸、巡洋艦一萬噸、故對於主力艦則减少一萬噸、約二成九、於航空母艦則减少五千噸、約一成九、巡洋艦减少三千噸、約縮少三成、總刮以上情形、稱爲縮减三成亦未可知、</p>
<p>（二）查軍縮可分爲量與質二方面、欲實現眞正軍縮、首應縮减其量、限制各國之保有量、再行加以質的縮少、而廢除攻擊上之兵力、然英國政府此次發表者、對於量的軍縮並未觸及任何處所、無論如何行使質的軍縮、倘未减少其量、則不成爲眞正之軍縮、是不待言、（三）據傳英國在現存條約、其巡洋艦不得超過五十艘、故無論若何、須主張使用七十艘、至於主力艦及航空母艦亦須以現在之艘數爲必要、倘英國所主張成爲事實、則縮少單艦噸數而合計其保有兵力、則其噸數非但不至較現在量有所减少、且有增加之趨勢、所謂軍縮甚至有成爲軍擴之虞、</p>
<p>（四）倘此次英國政府之聲明果係事實、當因美國代表團曾經發表意見、主張一律减少二成、故將從來主張减少其質而編出此項數字、以與美國對抗、亦未始不可推想、（五）美國主張减少二成、英國則主張减少三成均係臨時趕製之宣傳、决不能認爲在眞正至公至當之軍縮恊定上有所貢獻也、（八日日聯電）</p>

<p>互惠貿易發展</p>
<p>農民收入增加</p>
<p>共和黨人攻擊羅斯福總統的新政策、自是不遺餘力、同時一年多以來、也不見得有什麽特殊的效果、但是美國假設不實行N.R.A.政策、不轉換新政策、也并没有其他更好的方法、可以轉變今日美國一般經濟的頽勢、不過其間有一點、値得注意的、是一九三零年後、世界各國都實行保護貿易政策、增加關稅、結果是演成關稅戰爭、關稅壁壘愈高、國外市塲越狹小、國內市塲也不必一定有發展的餘地、美國受過了這種敎訓之後、深知這種政策、非根本更換、不足以換過目前梗塞的世界貿易狀態、</p>
<p>所以美國準備着减低關稅、實行互惠恊約、最初與美國結互惠恊約的是古巴、實行互惠恊約從本年九月三日起、到九月底的槪算、古巴糖本年一月至八月、輸入美國總計不過七萬三千萬磅、而九月一個月就有十五萬三千萬磅、這眞是令人驚訝的奇跡啊、美國對古巴的輸出也大見增加、例如小麥粉的輸出、去年九月輸出、古巴的値十九萬七千美金，今年九月增加到二十九萬八千美金、棉紗去年九月値三千八百美金、今年就增加到一萬六千美金、猪油去年九月輸出祗値三萬八千美金、今年同時期竟增加到二十九萬八千美金、薰肉也由去年的二萬三千美金、今年增加到九萬三千美金、單就古巴一國看、這個數目固然是很小、但是整個的美國貿易、九月份對外輸出値一萬九千六百六十九萬美金、輸入値一萬三千一百六十五萬九千美金、輸出超過計有六千五百零三萬一千美金、數目雖不甚大、但是一九三一年以來的最大輸出超過的數字、是實行互惠恊約、减低關稅的結果、今後將接續着與南美諸國比利時西班牙等商酌互惠恊約、</p>
<p>本年秋季、國內經濟還是在沉滯狀態之中、工業生產指數自五月後、卽繼續下跌、九月間竟是去年三月以來的最低紀錄、鋼鐵工業的工作能力、九月上旬僅及全生產能力的百分之一八·四、到十月間也不全過恢復到全能力的百分之二六·三、比較今年六月的生產力已逹全生產力百分之五七·四的數字、還不及二分之一、紡織工業的衰敗、最大原因是四十萬工人、罷工三個多星期、九月間每週平均生產棉花祗七千萬平方碼、也是不及上半年的一半、其餘如洋灰工業、汽車工業、等等都比去年低落、</p>
<p>工業生產旣向下低落、工人的狀况自必跟着惡化、據全美總工會的調察九月間的失業人數計有一千零九十五萬一千人、比八月間多一萬一千七百人、比去年九月的一千零十萬八千人、還多八十四萬三千人、其增加的數字不能說少、經濟前途也不能說是安定、</p>
<p>可是在另自一方面、却有一種奇異的現象、就是今年秋季、各百貨公司零售買賣都很好、無論是聯邦準備局所調查百貨者支出的指數、在八月和九月都保持着很高的數字、百貨公司何以會在工業衰落時節有這樣好的買賣、一則各工業部門對工資减低得很少、凡在職的人都保存着原有的購買力、二則是旱災的關係、農產物受自然限制、而市價上昇、農民的購買力因此略高、三則政府支出巨大額數的旱災救濟金、農村得到這一點補助、農民經濟也就活動些、據農事整理局的經濟報告、說今年八月農民的購買力比去年三月增加了百分之四四、不過這種樂觀材料究竟是缺乏恒久性的、縱然一般社會受「新政策」的刺激、表現若干活潑景象、如果產業不能振作、前途希望還是不大、祇有看互惠關稅恊約、實施之後、或者在國際間有一點轉機亦未可知、（十月二十九日於紐約）</p>

<p>首由本報舊同事新聞報郭步陶先生致詞、略謂、量才先生死於非命、無論識與不識、莫不同聲哀悼、史先生一身事業、功在社會、猝遭不幸、實爲中國社會一大損失、但事已至此、我人與其消極的悲哀、不如積極的努力、以繼史先生未竟之志、我以爲「犧牲」有兩種解釋、一是有意義的犧牲、一是無意義的犧牲、如史先生之死、實爲有意義的犧牲、世間事無不由犧牲而成功、不犧牲安有成功之希望、譬如造一案桌、必先犧牲樹木、犧牲人工、犧牲油漆、方能造成、他如飲食起居一切日常所需、都不免犧牲各種物質的本身、推至全世界人類一切的貢獻、何嘗不犧牲先賢聖哲之無限精力、而演成今日的文明、中外古今、史册所載、可爲參證、如耶穌犧牲於十字架上、其偉大的博愛精神、能使全世界人類、同受感化、佛敎慈悲的精義、千古流傳、至今勿衰、孔子爲萬世師表、亦當世最有犧牲精神者、不避一切苦難、其學說爲中外所同欽、右見「犧牲」二字、古往今來、如同一轍、量才先生爲當代名流、報界先進、不幸而犧牲性命、軀體雖死、而精神彪炳中外、永遠不死、其一身經營之事業、應如何繼續遺志、發揚光大、在座諸位、義毋庸辭、我故謂追悼之意、不在形式而在精神方面之努力、諸位繼史先生之遺志、努力前進、方不失追悼之本意、</p>
<p>（二）本報經理馬蔭良先生演說、略謂、史先生最愛護本館同人、今史先生不幸逝世、希望全體同人、以史先生愛護我等之心、愛護申報、則史先生雖死、而其精神不死矣、更有盼於我同人者、則不僅維護申報而已焉、必須盡力使其進步發展、則史先生之精神、不僅不死、且更有發揚光大之日矣、</p>
<p>（三）本報編輯部瞿紹伊先生演說、略謂、史先生之死、公認爲社會一大損失、蓋今日從事於社會事業之人之熱心毅力如史先生者、實不多觀也、史先生非至壽　之年、原可繼續爲社會效勞、今遇非常之變、使社會失一導師、其情實至可哀、是故哀史先生者、不特全館同人、而社會人羣、無不深致其痛惜之忱、史先生舍我人而去矣、後死者應繼起努力、永遠維持其事業於不敝、蓋社會事業之成功、爲創造者困難、爲維持者亦難、史先生爲創造者、我人爲維持者、將來社會事業有繼起負責之人、則創造人之勳業、歷千古而不滅、本報同人、向日抱定宗旨、輔助史先生之事業、史先生雖逝、其精神永留人間、其事業長存社會、吾人苟能一致努力、卽足以報效於先生、</p>
<p>（四）申報年鑑社主任張梓生先生演說、個人對於史先生平時修養功夫之欽敬、略謂、史先生暇頗涉獵佛典、其修養深得力於佛學、因能了解佛學中「精進」二字之奧義、故能奮發有爲、舍棄「小己」之利益、而顧到社會福利、努力興辦各種事業、因深得佛學中「明心見性」四字之助、故能見事瞭澈、凡百事務、一言可决、今史先生已歸道山、其修養功夫、則足資同人仿效、希望同人以「精進」精神、發揚申報事業、以「明心見性」功夫、觀察一切有關之問題、</p>
<p>（五）申報月刊社主任兪仲華先生、略謂、在今天本館同人追悼史先生的日子、我們同人個個覺心傷悲悼、我和月刊社同人、雖則進館以來、只有兩年多的時光、在館的資格很淺、但是對於史先生的慘遭狙擊、非常心痛、所以我曉得在館老資格的同人、一定更其悲哀、我對於史先生的慘遭不幸、覺得有千言萬語要講、但是在悲哀中、却覺得有話也無從講起、所以我現在只將今年夏天史先生的一段談話、報告於諸位、「有一位朋友馬星野先生、在美專攻新聞學、今年夏天畢業歸國、到了上海、要我和馬蔭良先生介紹他與史先生及老張先生談談、我們先介紹他和老張先生談、後來馬蔭良先生和我、又一同介紹他到史館去、和史先生去談天、史先生見了他、就告訴他辦報的經歷、史先生說報館好比是一只大的玻璃缸、很容易敲破的、我捧了有歷史的申報館二十多年、總算没敲破、到現在已捧得滿頭大汗、我老矣、將來要由報館中的許多老同事、來捧這申報了、他又說、老張先生數十年如一日、馬蔭良先生也爲報館積極奮鬭、辦報貴有恒、像老張先生的數十年如一日、眞是可佩服的、」豈料事隔數月、言猶在耳、不幸史先生竟長逝、不能再捧這申報、而這申報眞要靠託館中老資格的同事們來捧起來了、諸位同人、聽了我這小報告、一定格外傷心、但是我以爲諸位同人、諸位老資格的同人、傷心之餘、一定還感覺到責任的重大、因爲在前、申報是由史先生捧玻璃缸般捧的、現在這申報要由諸位同人、尤其是諸位資格老的同人、共同去負責捧了、史先生生前辦的事業很多、但是學生心血所寄的事業、却是申報、我相信人的軀殼、有時而盡、而精神是永遠不死的、軀殼可由狙擊而毁壞、但精神却不是槍彈所能消滅的、因爲軀殼可以毁壞、精神是消滅不了的、所以精神是永遠不死的、所以我以爲諸位同人、要紀念史先生、就要好好地維持申報、要發揮史先生不死的精神、也要好好地維持申報、諸位老資格的同人能負起維持申報的責任、就是紀念史先生的最好方法、也是證明史先生精神不死的最有力的證據、</p>
<p>（六）本報春秋主編周瘦鵑先生演說、略謂、史先生突於十一月十三日午後在滬杭國道遇難、鄙人於當晚在友人處得悉噩耗、初以爲不確、及到館時、已證實此訊、莫名痛悼、西方本以「十三」爲不祥名詞、國人每不之信、今史先生適於十三日慘遭爲悲觀派之人、視生死爲不足重輕者、然當此國難嚴重、我人正宜奮起精神、力謀打破國難之道、我個人感覺滬杭道上之槍聲、恰如「一二八」閘北之槍聲、閘北槍聲、傷中國之元氣、摧毁我文化事業、而杭滬道上之槍聲、殺我報界之權威者、其意義與悲慘、亦同樣重大、使我永誌而勿忘、史先生陷害、但爲申報而犧牲、則可斷言、而今史先生已矣、我人應循烈士之血跡、向前努力、以慰英靈云云、</p>
<h3 id="c122">同人宣誓 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>

<p>傳逹中央意旨共謀鞏固邊陲</p>
<p>察省現狀安謐財政尙可維持</p>
<p>察省主席宋哲元代表兼平整會委員蕭振瀛、日前代表蔣委員長偕同德王由綏入蒙、視察內蒙近况、並宣逹中央意旨、俾謀邊陲之鞏固與團結、業已事畢、由平南下、晋京謁蔣報告視察經過、在京公畢、昨日特由京來滬、當在旅邸接見申時社記者、談赴內蒙任務及蒙察軍政現狀、茲將詳情如下、</p>
<h3 id="c138">入蒙宣慰鞏固邊陲 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>據蕭氏談、蔣委員長月前爲明瞭全國各地政情實况、視察西北邊陲各地、俾作中央與邊區謀切實聯絡之張本、故蔣委員長抵綏遠時、頗擬入蒙一行、俾澈底了解內蒙現狀、蓋蒙古爲我國重要屏藩、關係重大、蔣委員長對此、極爲注意、奈以時間關係未免親往、其時德王等已聞訊赴綏晋謁、對蒙政有詳細之商談、內蒙邊區、過去向無政府重員親往視察、此次蔣委員長與德王會晤之結果、使中央與內蒙間之隔膜、已完全消除、蔣氏對蒙事今後方針、亦多懇切指示、事後蔣氏爲表示中央關切蒙政起見、特命本人偕同德王入蒙、宣逹中央意旨、並與各旗領袖商團結辦法、以鞏邊陲</p>
<h3 id="c139">視察內蒙印象甚佳 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>本人此次赴蒙、對蒙政前途施政各情、已與各旗盟領袖商談、並代逹中央對蒙事設施之意旨、及如何謀組織團結辦法、德王以下、均表示願與中央切實合作、內蒙自治委員會成立後、頗具相當成效、至蒙政之整個辦法、固尙待於繼續之努力、內蒙現狀、據本人此次視察所得、該地之遼闊、有如茫茫無邊之大海、外人欲圖佔據、亦非易事、蓋蒙地人民類多遊牧、散處而不集中、一切城市建設等、亦缺少集合之中心、故無論在軍事政治、亦都難於輕易控制、過去我國因未予深切注意、致遭他人之覬覦、並用種種引誘之方法、企圖籠絡蒙人操縱一切、如日人在內蒙遍設「善隣合作社」等、以廉價之物品、賒與蒙民、及設立醫院、施送藥品等、以期轉變蒙民之心理、此固爲一嚴重之危險、惟蒙人大部對日無好感、至對於我國過去、雖缺乏密切之聯絡、但仍對我多有良好之觀念、故我政府人民加以注意、而促進其團結、進而與我國謀更密切之合作、實爲今之急需云、</p>

<p>蕭氏繼談、察省現狀、尙無特殊異動、察熱邊境一帶、日僞軍常時有出没、向我軍尋釁、在彼方是否有抄襲東四省之故態與企圖、殊難斷定、但經我沉着應付、尙無他虞、至于宋主席則始終抱定一貫主張、保境安民遇事愼重、故能保持察省境內現狀平靜、現察省有軍隊四師兩混成旅、軍費悉由平軍分會撥發察省財政方面、因屬地瘠之區、收入向屬不豐、但經節省應付、尙可勉强維持、</p>

<p>末據蕭氏語申時社記者、此次南來任務、純係晋京謁蔣、報告蒙行經過、在京時已將詳情分别呈報、業已事畢、故順便來滬探視故舊、别無其他任務、擬卽晚搭夜快車返京、俟五全會後、由京啟程北返云、</p>

<p>據悉該行對於經營儲蓄本極重視、故吸收儲户存欵尙多、自經該銀行發表停業後、一般儲户、均至該行控詢實情、但以該行重要職員均不在內、故均未得要領、並據銀行界方面所探得、該行資本五十萬元、規模不大、在銀行界中、並無鉅欵往來、故此次停業、對於銀行界方面、並無影響云、</p>

<p>臘克斯一比零淘汰西捕</p>
<p>華捕亦以一比零克西商</p>
<p>今日優游對法商在逸園</p>
<p>史高塔杯第二週賽、東華先以五比零擊敗英尼斯、昨日兩塲、均出冷門、（一）臘克斯以一比零克西捕、（二）華捕亦以一比零淘汰西商、誠非意料所及、今日尙有一塲爲優游對法商、在逸園舉行、是賽之後、已至複賽週中、本届錦標、華隊實有厚望、</p>
<h3 id="c199">華捕竟然克西南 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>華捕與西商之戰、在逸園舉行、兩隊表演平庸、索然無味、西商每况愈下、軍容衰敗、竟以一比零爲華捕擊敗、使二三千觀衆、雀躍三百、喜出望外、華捕守門尹杏生福星高照、救出險球無算、誠華捕之大功臣、兩隊陣綫如下、</p>
<p>華捕</p>
<p>尹杏生馬秉璋薛志文朱貴全苗華國張子權吳錫泉廖忠乾董兆斌邱天生姚家珪</p>
<p>西南</p>
<p>萊維斯麥克勞法平勃琪斯史篤克海特萊福洛士麥考全台法斯德哥侖布拉遜</p>
<p>西商運道眞不佳西商體前、豈眞不敵華捕耶、總而言之、運道不佳耳、自始至終、華捕趨於被壓迫之地位、西商頻頻攻打、奈何不得其門而入、實以華捕初登大塲、個個精神奮發、士象激昂、更以全力主守、遂使西商無所用其極、徒喚奈何而已、</p>
<p>姚家珪打開紀錄上半時和平過去、各無所獲、下半時開始約十分鐘時、華捕忽然脫離囚範、邱天生一球飛送前方、董兆斌乘對方內部空虛之際、竄前一步、將球左盤右盤、離門有二十五碼之遙、忽然舉脚射門、力道甚足、球在球門橫木彈回、守門爲之一驚、華捕右翼姚家珪剛剛闖至門側、見球順勢一脚、球飛射入門、由橫木彈下、已過球門綫、守門急用手拍、已不及矣、</p>
<p>尹杏生保國有功華捕得此勝利、眞如喜從天降、精神愈爲振作、吳錫泉曾有兩次傳遞、落點甚佳、可惜中路接應者不得其當、坐失機會、西商不甘示弱、全軍反攻、連珠怒射、但運道不佳、非出界、卽射在拉上·更以守門尹杏生福至心靈、救出險球不知其數、博得采聲如雷、江山保全、唱得勝之歌、實此君之公也、賽畢出塲、受觀衆包圍、備受歡迎、</p>
<h3 id="c200">臘克斯擊敗西捕 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>另一塲史高塔杯賽爲臘克斯對西捕、在跑馬廳交鋒、西人觀者、環立如堵、西捕實力、素稱驃悍、臘克斯原屬虎將、然事前一般推測、西捕不難操得勝劵、詎料結果、竟適得其反、臘克斯反以一比零淘汰西捕、此球在上半時由鮑塞列打入、兩隊競爭殊烈、表演頗佳、西人球隊之不景氣、實使優游在華有莫大希望焉、</p>
<h3 id="c201">今日優游戰法商 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>史高塔杯二週賽今日尙有一塲、爲法商對優游下午三時在逸園會師、上週聯合賽中、優游曾以五比三擊敗法商、今日狹路再逢、必有更劇烈之競爭、更以昨日西捕敗於臘克斯、西商敗於華捕以後、華人球隊佔有極大勢力、望優游努力爲之、如優游亦敗法商、則將來複賽、西人球隊僅一臘克斯、華隊佔居其三、錦標非華隊莫屬焉、</p>

<p>今年各省旱災奇重、政府諸公、籌欵謀振、不遺餘力、上次曾邀優遊晋京、作慈善足球、以籌集欵項、今又邀東華足球隊進京、再作一慈善比賽、該項比賽、即定今日下午三時、在首都勵志社球塲舉行、東華球隊、全隊十六人、亦於今晨搭早快車晋京、下午二時可到、一到就踢、聞孔部長特備銀杯一座、藉資紀念而東華會委員長吳鐵城市長、適晋京參與五中全會、亦擬趁比賽之期、對隊員訓話、以資鼓勵、該會委員如宋子良·周守良·盛蘋臣·胡梅庵·丁雪農諸公、咸聯袂晋京、襄此盛舉云、茲錄得該隊隊員名單如後、</p>

<p>籃球隊不同往足球隊之外、東華籃球隊、原亦在被邀之列、後該會以種種之困難、將籃球隊之邀請婉謝、據該會籃球員談、其所謂困難者如此、（一）在京須在勵志社户外球塲比賽、此時天時已寒、氣候方面、不甚適宜、（二）在户外比賽、容易受傷、（三）須在日間比賽、因京中殊少室內籃球房之設備、且須指定在勵志社舉行也、如能改於晚間室內舉行、該隊甚樂於赴京也云云、</p>

<p>突來反擊東華不費吹灰之力、輕取三城、一時士氣大振、敵人失色、然以勝來過易、進攻之勢、遂歸和緩、而沙壳爾則乘此機宜、大華反襲、竟爲中鋒柯星、連進二次、上半時、遂成三對二之緊張局面、下半時後、幸士卒用命、由李義臣再射破門、以四對二東華獲勝、</p>

<p>— 玄子</p>
<p>你們每逢星期一早上都要做糺念週，在讀完了總理遺囑之後、接着便是「靜默三分鐘」；這「靜默」究竟是什麽意思呢，諸位小朋友中有的不但不很知道，恐怕在「靜默」的時候，還在那裏竊竊私語；有的呢，甚至在那裏埋怨「靜默」的時間太長，這都是不對的。</p>
<p>你們讀過了遺囑而必須要你們「靜默」者，正所以要你們在靜默的當兒追懷總理，更要細細想一想總理的遺囑中，一句句我們都做到没有？如果還没有做到，我們應該要怎樣的具着堅毅不拔的精神，繼着總理的精神去實行總理所遺留給我們的囑咐。</p>
<p>要這樣做才不失爲總理的信徒，也是你</p>
<p>們小朋友們人人要牢記着的一件事。</p>
<h3 id="c215">世界名人的童年 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>林肯</p>
<p>解放黑奴，禁止蓄婢，主張人道主義的美國有名總統林肯朋友們聽見過他的名字嗎？他童年的時候，家裏是非常窮苦的，飯也吃不飽，住的地方是一間破木板釘起來的木房子。讀書自然没有機會了。他只進過六個月的小學校，等到他識了一些字以後，便自己用功。他一面帮助父親做工，一面就自己讀書。他没有錢買書，就向和他相識的朋友借書來讀。</p>
<p>有一次，他讀到華盛頓傳，知道華盛頓的爲人，他忽然拍書大呌起來：「我將來一定要做像華盛頓這樣的人！」聽見他說這話的人，都嘲笑他，看不起他，因爲他身上連衣服都穿得很破舊，那裏會做到這樣偉大的人物呢？</p>
<p>可是，小朋友們，你相信嗎？偉大事業的成功，不是靠着有錢；而是要有堅苦的精神，剛强的意志，並且，需要有俠義的行爲，林肯對這幾件，却都齊備了。有一天，他看見一位醉漢跌在溝裏去，他去攙他起來，並且扶他到一處就近的人家裏，要求主人給他安睡，他親自看護他，直到他醒來，這時候，他還不過是十二三歲的孩子。小朋友們看看林肯童年時候的行爲，多少勇敢，有義氣哪！</p>
<p>誠實，也是林肯小時候的行爲，當他在十八歲的時候，帮助一間店舖中做夥計。在怱忙中多收了顧客四個辨士，（英幣名）到了晚上結賬，才想起來。他就把這錢送到那顧客的家裏去，路很遠，况且又是深夜，但，林肯是不計較那些的，他覺得信用比一切都緊要呀！</p>
<p>林肯在童年時這樣的精神和意志，行爲，終造成了他長大時偉大的功績，小朋友，你看了這故事有什麽感想</p>
<h3 id="c216">不要怕冷 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 阿多</p>
<p>小朋友！冬天又來了！冬天雖然是寒冷，但是我們仍然應該照常注意衛生。</p>
<p>有很多事情，大家都因爲怕冷而不去做了！因此我特來提醒你們：</p>
<p>晚上睡覺切不可關窗，以防空氣不流通。</p>
<p>睡覺時候不要把被蒙過頭，蒙頭睡覺不衛生。</p>
<p>穿衣太多了，走路要當心。</p>
<p>運動熱了，不要立卽解除衣裳，着凉會傷風。</p>
<p>冷天遊戲：不要玩水，不要玩火；玩水凍僵手，玩火危險大。</p>
<h3 id="c217">食鹽 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們讀過了化學没有？讀過了的小朋友，一定是說很難的，但是化學很有興趣。</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們可知道食鹽是用什麽方法製成的？</p>
<p>（一）晒法：沿海的地方，在海岸上設置鹽田，當潮水漲的時候，導海水到鹽田裏，利用風力和太陽的熱力，使水蒸發，等到溶液到適當濃度的時候，再注在結晶池裏，使溶液結晶成食鹽。</p>
<p>（二）煎法：導海水到鹽田裏，田裏舖細砂，因細砂能吸水，利用日光和風力使水蒸發。太陽落後則剷成一堆，下一天將砂舖開，再灌入海水，再晒再堆。這樣的幾天後，等到砂裏所含的鹽量，到適當濃度的時候，將砂放在櫃形的濾器裏，注入海水，使鹽溶解而濾過，和泥砂分離，將這極濃的濾液放在鍋子裏燒乾，就得食鹽。</p>
<p>倘使把食鹽溶成溶液，用電解的方法，就是一面通正電，一面通負電，結果一面就有一種黃綠色的氣體，這就是氯？是一種很毒的氣體。一面就有一種帶灰色的金屬固體，這就是鈉。如果把鈉放在水裏，那是很危險的，並且也不能把鈉放在手裏。</p>
<p>小朋友們，我想你們以爲是氯和鈉都是很毒的東西，吃到肚子裏去，不是要死的嗎？</p>
<p>食鹽是一些也不毒的，因爲食鹽是氯和鈉的化合物，所以又呌做氯化鈉，已經失去了氯和鈉的本來性質了。</p>

<p>— 雲天</p>
<p>（一）我們爲什麽覺得饑餓？</p>
<p>答：我們的胃是完全由筋肉所組織的機官，藉了這機官的運動，食物才得消化；如果我們的胃部空虛了幾小時，就會起一種間歇的痙攣性的收縮，在收縮的同時，我們感到了饑餓。所以饑餓的直接原因是胃的筋肉收縮。</p>
<p>（二）上山爲什麽要把身體向前彎曲？下山爲什麽要把身體挺直？</p>
<p>答：我們身體的重心大槪在腰部，上山時若不彎身向前，則兩腿前去，重心失却平衡，立刻就要下來了。下山時把身體挺直，道理也是一樣的。</p>
<p>（三）天氣爲什麽會有冷熱？</p>
<p>答因爲地球自轉，日光對地球成斜射，熱力不足，所以到了寒天，氣候變冷了。若是正射，就變熱。此外空氣對流，也可以使氣候發生變化的。</p>
<p>（四）用手摸鐵，爲什麽比摸木頭冷些呢？</p>
<p>答：鐵的傳熱力比木頭快，用手摸鐵，則手上的熱，被傳去較快，所以覺得冷些。</p>
<p>（五）在暗室裏，爲什麽看不見東西？</p>
<p>答：一切東西能射入人的眠簾，全靠有光的反射；暗室無光，所以看不見。</p>

<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>在現在，又有不少的小朋友，很起勁的踢毽子，因爲踢毽子本來是秋天和冬天的一種娛樂啊！</p>
<p>小朋友們的娛樂，很少高尙有益的。惟有這踢毽子，不但可以作爲游戲，而且還可以强健身體，所以現在很有許多人在提倡踢毽子的運動。毽子的製法是這樣的：用一個鵝毛管子，剪成一寸長，放在有眼的銅錢裏面，再用布把銅錢連着鵝毛管的一端包起來，拿綫縫好。另外再找幾根雄鷄尾巴上的帶有白絨的彩色的鷄毛，插在鵝毛管子裏，就成爲一個毽子了？</p>
<p>毽子的踢法，更是五花八門，各出心裁，有正踢；有反踢；有拿兩脚換着踢的；有把毽子踢到臉上來的；更有踢到背上去的；也有用鼻子來接着的；會踢的不但能够踢出多少花式來，而且能够踢到幾百，幾千，而始終不讓它落在地上。不過纔踢的人，往往祗能踢到兩個；最多也不過十個八個。所以踢毽子也要天天練習。纔能够逐漸的增加，因爲踢毽子也是一種藝術啊！</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們如果踢不多；踢不好；你們千萬不能性急，要知道他們踢的多；踢的好；也是下過功夫練習的，你祗要天天不不踢着，自然會有一天踢的多；踢的好了啊！</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>我們到了冬季，因爲外氣的溫度上下，血液的溫度，也跟着氣候而高低。爬蟲類與兩棲類等冷血動物，其過冬的方法，就是因其血液低下而度過嚴冬的，可是名爲冷血動物，實際上，並非全部是冷血。如在冬季溫度突下。棲住於寒冷地方的動物，換到熱帶地方，自然不會冬眠，其在寒冷的地方，冷血動物的血液跟了溫度，漸漸的降下去，細胞的活動作用滯鈍，消化作力减退，所有的機能，都是衰頽，所以也不想吃，又不會動，匍匐在地下了。大槪這等冷血動物，到了六十度以下溫度，就要冬眠，越過冬季到了溫度昇上六十度，又會活動，想吃東西。其在水中的動物，也是在陸地一樣的，沈在水底，全靠皮膚的呼吸作用過了冬，譬如烏龜，它沈在水底，完全停止呼吸，但是它在冬眠以前，已經攝取了很多的食物，所以也不要吃東西，假使此時亂餵食物，雖然吃下去，也不會消化，到了四五月，就要排泄出來，所以在冬眠時期，不必餵飼，至於用溫室飼養，那就不同了</p>

<p>小朋友！你們知道范文正公的事跡嗎？他是北宋時候的良相，「文正公」是他的諡法，他的名字呌「仲淹」，他小時候家裏很窮，然而他能够在惡劣的環境中，抱着堅忍不㧞的志向，借住在和尙廟裏，孜孜不倦的讀書，吃呢？燒了一次粥，分做幾頓，小菜呢？只吃些醃　罷了。</p>
<p>後來他考中了秀才，就拿國家的責任放在心上，並且說：「我當先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂。」當他做宋仁宗宰相的時候，有個西夏國很是怕他說：「小范老子，腹中有數萬甲兵」。也因此不敢來犯我中國，他能够把天下治得非常太平，可見他是一個很有責任心的人。</p>

<p>變形虫很像飴糖做成的，伸縮非常的迅速，而棲息在水中。它全身没有足，行動時，身體的某部自然會突出；我們平常稱它爲「僞足」。假使僞足太短而不能行動，它會再伸出一隻來哩。</p>
<p>當變形蟲要取食物的時候，它就伸出唯一的僞足，把食物的兩面捲抱住，像我們用手捧着吃一般；這時僞足漸漸地合併起來，食物便被它捲入身體內部了。食物消化後，從它的體內排泄到身外來，這的確是下等動物的特徵。</p>

<h3 id="c228">「怪」論 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>現今又是個閒談的大時代。古者的所謂清談，不曾見過；今人所談，大抵無「女」不成「天」。談影星，談舞后，談校花，談花瓶，談名媛，談貴婦，······談之不足，又筆之於文。目前海上浮着一種開胃的談助，是甚麽「不嫁大同盟」；大家都傳遍了牠的主張，有過了不少的名文，繪影繪聲，津津有味，祇可惜不曾調查出誰是團員。</p>
<p>在今日，如果是一個有知識的女性，爲了通姦案的不平，而發出「不嫁」的主張，那當然是可怪；可是毫不思量，毫不反省，見怪而怪，則又社會人士的可怪了！日來幾有報館的訪員，訪過許多聞名的女士，對此事都說不知就裏；堂堂一個大同盟，怎麽會弄到神鬼莫測呢？我不是有心給女性護短，定說這全然是捕風捉影之談；不過縱令實有其事，落給我們社會人士的，也只有開導糾正之責，而無舖張諷嘲之分。因爲她們到底是數千年來受過最大的壓迫，露點兒幼稚，並不見得是罪大惡極的。</p>
<p>若說這竟然是一篇謠言，那更可怪；常言「楚人好謠」，楚人在二十年的內戰中，死的該已彀算了，現在郤還能瀰漫海濱，抑何楚人之多也？談而必謠，謠而必及女人，謠及女人便瞬刻而走遍四方，豈不怪哉？</p>
<p>年來神怪小說，神怪影戲之類，在社會成了流行的惡病。曾記王漁洋題聊齋詩云：「姑妄言之姑聽之，豆棚瓜架雨如絲，料應嫌作人間語，愛聽秋墳鬼唱詩。」人間語應說的何止千萬？而人必唯怪之爲談；社會的混亂没落，可以想見。然而自好者必不惡自我作，必不隨流逐波。果有人主張，不嫁同盟」，自是眩奇的怪論；若果是誰人的揑造，進而廣爲宣揚，則更爲怪之尤；要之，都不是修身自好的人物。</p>
<p>社會上隨處都是談鬼，談玄，談神，談有「性」刺戟的女人，婚姻，通姦，老是不經之談；正經事讓鐵蹄大砲來解决，讓血腥腦袋來處理。人人浸沉於怪行怪論，悖謬荒唐，烏有子虛之中；這一個怪民族，大可以莫須有了。事實上，帝國主義者也會呌我們莫須有了啊！</p>

<p>— 郭箴一</p>
<p>誰都知道，男女不能眞正平等的原因是，宗法社會的傳統思想没有完全打破，男女眞正平等的制度没有產生。這次女權運動雖對於婦女問題。未見得是根本解决，但至少表現了婦女自身掙扎和反抗的熱情，尤其是在這個驅逐婦女回到家庭去做新賢妻良母的時候。</p>
<p>二三九條刑法的修正，不過是表面上的勝利，實際上我們仍須聯合大衆的力量共同努力；對於一般勞工婦女，更當以團體的精神，給她們以極大的援助。所以要求規定完善的勞動法，也是女權運動中的重要的一項。</p>
<p>女工問題，已經使多數人注意，而女工痛苦亦已激起社會的同情，政府曾根據保護母性及同工同酬的原則。制定新式的工廠法。並明令於民國二十年公布施行，惜因各廠主要求展期。迄今此法不過是紙上空文。在更完善的勞動法還没有明文規定以前，負有婦女運動使命的團體，應該再接再厲督促政府迫令廠主切實施行。</p>
<p>茲將該工廠法。關於婦女者，最要緊數條，大槪附錄於後：</p>
<p>（一）凡未滿十四歲之男女，工廠不得僱用爲工人······</p>
<p>（二）男女工人在十四歲以上未滿十六歲者爲童工，童工祇從事輕便工作。</p>
<p>（三）童工及女工不得從事處理有爆發性引火性或有毒質之物品其他有害風紀或有危險性工作。</p>
<p>（四）成年工人每日實行工作時間以八小時爲原則，如因地方情形或工作性質有必須延長者得定十小時。</p>
<p>（五）童工每日一人工作時間不得超過八小時。</p>
<p>（六）童工不得在午後七時至翌晨六時之時間內工作。</p>
<p>（七）女工不得在午後十時至翌晨六時之時間內工作。</p>
<p>（八）凡工人繼續工作到五小時應有半小時之休息。</p>
<p>（九）凡工人七日中應有一日之休息。</p>
<p>（十）男女同等之工作而其效力相同者應給同等之工資。</p>
<p>（十一）女工分娩前後應停止工作八星期，工資照給。</p>
<p>（十二）女工依工廠法第三十七條之規定停工者，因廠方之請求取具醫生之診斷書。</p>
<p>（十三）童工女工及年滿五十歲之工人，其工作分配應於健康檢查後定之。</p>
<p>（十四）工廠僱用女工者應於可能範圍內設託嬰所並僱用看護人妥爲照料。</p>

<p>— 茜</p>
<p>是在六月初的一天下午，廣廣的氣候由微熱，而轉暴熱的時候，我參觀了平樂看守所的女監——這女監是和男監連在一個院落之內。進大門不遠，便是一道很粗大的木頭欄柵，柵門外售票處樣的一套桌椅之前，坐着一個男所員，桌上像陳設着一座假山石似的，高高地堆起一大串鑰匙，桌子側邊放有一口無蓋小箱，箱內裝滿了破銅爛鐵，據作嚮道的所長小姐告訴我，那是囚犯們晚間上的脚鐐手銬。進了第一道柵門不遠，就是第二道柵門，這時柵門內的女所員，由所長小姐的介紹，馬上笑嘻嘻地拿起她的隨身寶——一大串大大小小的鑰匙，迎上來了。我們一面寒暄着，一面脚下已踏上了那隔開男女監房的甬道。在這兒没走上好幾步，我便瞥見了，前面第三道柵門外，有四五個小孩子。據說那就是街坊上鬧了幾天的，兩個人販子由桂林拐下來的七個小孩中的四五個，於是我們遂將脚步向着未上鎖的第三道柵門外移動。這第三道柵門外，是一片天井樣的荒凉空地，地面上的兩三個污水潭邊，蚊子正在那兒唱歌。左手靠牆處。還有一間只剩得屋頂的矮小破屋，屋內地下一個三塊磚做成的臨時灶前，有一三十多歲的女人在炒飯。由站在旁邊的女所員的說明，這空地是孩子們游玩的塲所，這臨時灶是女犯自己燒菜的地方。</p>
<p>凑巧那女犯的飯已炒好，女所員要送她回監房，於是我們大大小小一行人，便都踅回第三道柵門內，沿着甬道向右走了四五尺遠，就到了女監房。這兒門外也是一排很粗大的木欄柵，柵門外橫起一把五六寸長的大鎖。在木欄柵和那作爲女監房的矮平房之間，尙有兩三尺寬的一塊空地，這空地上擠着七八個女犯，有的立，其中兩三個在做鞋底，一個在結麻。烏暗的矮平房內，尙坐有十來個女犯在那兒呆着各自發愁，也有兩三個很沉靜地做着鞋。這二十多個女犯，除了靠監房門立着發呆的那個只二十一二歲外，其餘的，看上去，都已三十開外，有些恐怕快到四十了。她們的表情，大都呆鈍而愁苦，至於膚色，可說是劃一的，無論面部或手膀上，都會令人立時想起一隻裹了幾十年的小脚，剛解開裹脚布來時的那種死灰白色。</p>
<p>女犯們好像與所長小姐都很要好，當我們在她們欄柵外逗遛的十歲分鐘，有好幾個將做好的鞋底交把她，轉帶給外面的顧主。因爲外面請人做鞋，一般是一毛半小洋一隻，破布麻線均歸靯主人出，但女犯替人做鞋，不但工錢减至一毛，而且麻線也須女犯自備，因此也有不少乘機貪便宜的人拿鞋底給女犯做。除拜託帶鞋底以外，另有一個愁容滿面的婦人，萬分懇切地要求所長小姐帮她寫一份呈請書。聽女所員講，這婦人是賀縣某鄉的人，因與叔子通姦，被丈夫告了，現已判决在平樂受四個月的徒刑，但他丈夫不服，仍在要求法院將她提到原籍的看守所監禁，以丢她的臉。她之所以要寫呈請書，是在申明她本人不願意轉監。</p>
<p>離開監房，我和所長小姐又談了一會，她告訴我，在，男犯中，匪案，盜案，爭田案，欠欵案，人販案，殺人案等等都有，可是女犯中，十之九是因姦情被丈夫控告，或被族間控告的。就是那個靠門邊立起年紀最輕的女犯，也是因有了另一個情人，一夜他丈夫拿起菜刀跑去殺她的情人時，她不得已帮着救護人把丈夫殺死了；現已判决終身監禁</p>
<p>腦子裏充滿了陰暗的可怖的幻想，我走出了看守所的門，在路上我想起我的表姐夫。表姐夫和他店裏的女調擠師不是犯有姦情兩年之久嗎。一切詳情，表姐全知道，而且還帮他們設法打過兩次胎。由監中的情形看來，有夫之婦與人通姦，卽或自己的丈夫不問罪，族間以及社會上的人士也要將她置於法律之下；可是有婦之夫——如我的表姐夫——與人通姦，不但他的妻不控告他，反而設法周全他，族間以及社會上的人士，都說他本事高。</p>
<p>話又說回來，這種男女在姦情案上不平等的待遇，已成過去的陳跡，現在已有了新規定的男女絶對平等刑法；而且照王寵惠和傅秉常兩位先生的推測：將來這種新刑法實行起來，爲夫者，將大多數爲其妻所控告，而監獄因這種有婦之夫的被控入獄，將有人滿之患。今後，我將括目而觀，尤其是要看看我那位表姐，會不會抓住刑法第二三九條的新規定這個法寳，去控告她那已犯姦案二年有餘的丈夫。</p>
<h3 id="c231">談喬治桑 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 勾</p>
<p>在世界各國過去的婦女文學中要想找到一位始終在離叛現實的偉大作家時，那我便以爲只有法國底喬治桑（George　Sand）是可以當選的。</p>
<p>過去的婦女作家大槪不外兩種：第一是貴族或官庭底附庸，第二是娼妓賣唱式的人物。歷史上給予婦女的地位使得她們除了做這兩種「人才」而外是很難有其他方面的發展的。不過，我們却不否認，也有一二例外。那一二例外的角色常常是由於社會變革期間的某種條件而產生，並且其特出的地方每每還會比較同時代有作爲的男子更爲可驚。這層，對於那般不懂歷史性的科學家所倡導的女子先天不及男子的學說，正是一種有力的事實的反攻。現在我要來說的偉大的喬治桑，也就是這樣特出的角色中的一個。</p>
<p>一向做文學史的人總把喬治桑簡單地列入浪漫主義文學裏面，對於她底眞價値都一槪抹煞不提。像法國比較進步的名文學史家朗松（Lan　on）講到她時便稱她底小說爲浪漫主義的「抒情小說」。但是，喬治桑果眞僅僅是一個浪漫主義的抒情小說家嗎？我敢說不是，絶對不是！我們應該很正確地認識這位偉大的女作家，應該把她從霧瘴中救拔出來。</p>
<p>喬治桑本是出身貴族，她是地主杜般（Dupin）　女兒　　　杜　　　　　　　　　，但是，她却離開了她底環境，而走到完全和她底出身極相反的路上。他抛棄了她底丈夫，隻身到巴黎用叛逆的筆寫出多量反抗當時社會制度的作品。當時在法國，正是一八四八年七月革命醞釀的時間，這種社會變革的激潮把血管中流着有貴族血液的市民階級中之善良者推上飛躍的前途。喬治桑便這樣出現到我們底面前了。</p>
<p>她初期的作品如「萊麗亞」（“Lelia”）「加克」（“Jacques”）等。文學史家都稱爲「言情小說」，其實，完全不是這麽一回事。那些小說主重的只是性愛問題和婚姻問題而决不是簡單的「言情」。在喬治桑底意思，以爲結婚必須要有戀愛，戀愛可以使婚姻不至成爲傭俗或悲劇，並且婚姻要有絶對的自由纔得化爲神聖，就是說，夫婦間感情一破裂時便得自由離婚，不能有絲毫虛僞的遷就。這種理論在現在看來固然没有甚麽新奇，但在當時歐洲却是反貴族婚姻制度的急先鋒。喬治桑用她小說中的主人公來證明了這一切，她底態度同她本身底行爲一樣，是異常的堅定而不含糊的。</p>
<p>但是，她埋頭的問題却不止於此。在她把性愛和婚姻問題這樣發表了意見以後，便又着手於一般的社會問題。像「安基卞底磨房主人」（“Le　Mennier　d'Angibautt”）「安般訥先生之罪」（“Le　Peche　de　Monsiem　Antoine”）等小說便是她第二步的工作。在前一部中的女主人公是一個女地主，却願與工人結婚；在後一部中的男主人公是一個貴族，却願死後將自己底財產交給肯犧牲本身而履行新制度的地主。她幾乎是無情地在攻擊着家產制度，她造出同許多人物在代表她來發言。我們可以說，她初期的作品是她對於人類家庭問題的提供，而第二步的社會小說却是從人類生理的解决逹到人類經濟的解决了。不待說她所理想的社會並不是一種眞正可以實現的社會，但這個是另一問題，她底本身終不失爲偉大。</p>
<p>她後期的作品是完全傾向於農民的，這意義在一向的文學史上也没有說明。這自然也不是偶然。喬治桑根本理想的社會是要人類能得到生理上和經濟上的自由，同時她也認明白了要得到這種自由須對於壓在人民頭上的一切都予以否定。與勒羅（Pierre　Leroux）爲友而共同發行過對革命有貢獻的刊物的她，和當時勞動運動中的許多名人都有了往還，她在追求她底理想，希望一八四八年的革命能給她以理想社會的實現。然而，事實上七月革命以後，並没有照她所想像的那樣給予她甚麽，不特說這使她非常失望，而這失望的結果，便使她逃回到她少女時代的農村中去。在這後期的作品中，像「小發特蒂」（“La　Petite　Fadtte”）和「棄兒佛朗絲窪」（“Francois　le　Champt”）等都是描寫農民的事跡，不過她始終没有放棄她底主張：她把肯定的筆鋒都揮到貧農和勞苦的農民上面，而對於地主等却總是出之以否定的筆鋒的。</p>
<p>人都知道喬治桑和詩人謬塞（Musset）戀愛的故事，都知道喬治桑後來是遺棄了謬塞，但是郤始終没有人解釋過這段流傳千古的文壇佳話中所含的社會意義。據我看來，喬治桑所以終於不能和謬塞偕老的就是因爲他們本身思想不能一致的緣故。謬塞是没落貴族的代表者，他曾歡迎過拿破崙，還對於殺路易非里布的罪犯加以毀駡，他在後來的，世紀兒之懺悔，（“Contession　d'nu　enfant　du　Siecle”）中還會非難過福祿特爾。像這樣一位反動的詩人，無論如何是很難和人民主義者的喬治桑打成一片的。在這段佳話中，我們正可以證明當時貴族階級分裂後的兩個代表者的冰炭。</p>
<p>總之喬治桑是一個偉大的作家，我希望文學史家尤其是侈談婦女文學的人用新的觀點，來對她作些研究。我這篇短文的目的也就是爲此。</p>
<h3 id="c232">美國勞働婦女的現狀 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 李秀英</p>
<p>美國的勞働婦女在現時大槪有一·六○○·○○○，如果以她們的年齡來做比例，則二十歲以下的保十五％，二十五歲以下的佔三十七％其中還有幾十萬的童工。</p>
<p>她們多數分佈在紡績工業，成衣工業，糧食工業，皮革工業，烟草工業，五金工業中。</p>
<p>她們的工作時間，在羅斯福的復興運動前，普通多規定每週不得超過五十四小時（美國一般的薪給是依每週計算的）。但這些規定，僅僅是例文，資本家是很少會遵守的。例如本雪文尼亞州的法律規定婦女與童工每週工作時間至多不能超過五十四小時，而事實上，女工每天得做十一小時或十二小時的工作。</p>
<p>一九三三年春，復興計劃宣佈施行後，祇有一小部份的企業是暫時地縮短了工作時間。如絲廠至一九三三年三月間每週工作時間是三十六·九小時，至一九三二年九月則縮短到三十三·九小時。又如棉織業，一九三三年三月間的每週工作時間是四十四·一小時，至同年九月，則縮短到三十五·八小時。但其他企業中，一九三三年秋季每週平均的工作時間較同年三月間的更有增加，如烟廠每週的工作，時間從三十六·五小時增加到三十八·五小時；電器機器業從二十八小時增加到三十三·四小時。而且資本家在已縮短的工作時間中，强迫工人增加勞働速率，縮短牠們的吃飯，大小便的時間，來補救他們縮短時間時損失！如以前每週工作六十小時製造一百件生產品的，現在就得在四十小時內製造出同樣數目的生產品。</p>
<p>做夜工仍舊是很平常的，雖然很多州的法律上明明寫着禁止女工及童工做夜工，但資本家是不會遵守的像下面所舉的例，已經是很「客氣的遵」法律了：紐約州的一個女工，從早上七點三十分做起，一直做到第二天早上十二點零六分爲止，但她的工作紀錄上都寫着做到當天晚上九點半爲止。當她向工頭爭辯時，工頭說：「是的，我知道。但是，說九點半自然比說十二點零六分好聽得多了！」</p>
<p>美國勞働婦女的工作，時間旣然這樣的長，但她們的工資呢？却是可憐得很。每工作一百小時得到十四元三角工資的女工，常常會講：「如果要吃飯，就付不出房租；如果付了房租，就没有食吃」。但這些工資比較那些在别的企業中的女工－以每週來計算工資的－確已增多了。一個工廠調查團在一九三三年所調查出來的一些女工的工資，幾乎使人不相信，每週祗有一元到五元！</p>
<p>從羅斯福的復興計劃中，規定每週工資自十二元到十四元，不得再低，這一點看起來，似乎每天二元的工資比每週二元的工資多得多，但如果想一想美國現在的生活程度，就會知道這些「較高」的工資仍舊不能維持生活的，而且有些地方，自復興計劃實施後，女工的工資反而减少了。如一九三三年六月間，紐約州的女工每週工資是十二元五角三分，較去年同月减低十六％；伊利諾亞州的女工的每週工資，至一九三三年十二月是十二元零三分，較去年同月减低二十五％。工資的减低，自然與美國在經濟恐慌中失業工人的增加——據秘爾頓研究院的統計，一九三三年五月前美國失業工人共有一七·○三四·○○○－有關。有這麽多的失業工人，資本家可以用很低廉的代價去付給工人了。</p>
<p>美國勞働婦女的工資，一般講來，都是比男子少，有的相差至五十％，一方美國的黑種女工工資比白種女工的工資更少。黑種女工多分佈於製造及機器工業，烟廠，成衣工業，糧食工業等企業中。她們多半做那些粗重的，齷齪的，「最下等工作」。</p>
<p>美國勞働婦女所得的工資是如此的微小，但維持生活的支出却仍浩大。特别是通貨膨脹以來，物價都一律提高。這樣雖然是有業的女工，也是處在半飽半餓中。像普通每週收入四元的女工，每天得費去二毛錢車費，三毛錢飯食，每天得化五毛，每星期即三元，剩下一元，還得付房租，電費，衣服，······勞働婦女，除了至工廠裏得做長時間的工作外，至家裏，也有許多工作等她去做：燒飯，洗衣，喂小孩······。</p>
<p>這樣，每天在工廠裏過度的勞動，再加上家裏的工作，便很利害的耗費着他們的生活素，所以他們都未老先衰。</p>
<p>當成千成萬的女工在做着加工工作，做着夜工，毀壞她們的康健，甚至喪失她們的性命的時候；在另方面，還有將近四百萬的婦女失掉工作，等候工作做。而且在所有的在業女工中，有二十七％是做局部工的。</p>
<p>這些事實，證明了美國女工在羅斯福的復興計劃實施後幾個月之中，工作時間仍舊是延長的，工資仍舊是微小的，失業女工仍舊不斷在增加着。同時，這些事實也使美國的勞働婦女覺司靠資本家來爲工人謀幸福是夢想，她祗有靠自己的力量，努力奮斗，方能逹到她們所期望的一切。</p>
<p>海外婦訊</p>
<p>— 式</p>
<p>（一）印度婦女的社會活動</p>
<p>印度婦女不論過去現在對於科學宗敎及社會的安寗幸福，都有過不少的貢獻，可是有組織的活動，還是最近才開始。</p>
<p>目下，她們最重要的工作，是屬於政治方面的，卽參加印度獨立運動，和男子同爲自由而鬥爭，有過莫大的牲犧。婦選運動開始於一九一七年，當時全印婦女的代表曾訪問來印的印度事務大臣「蒙得顧」氏，要求和男子同等的參政權，中央議會雖不能有婦女代表，而地方政府給與她們公民權，在地方政治的範圍內，給與百萬以上的婦女以參政權。其結果，博士「列得伊」夫人做了麻打拉薩州立法義會的副議長。</p>
<p>在倫敦的英印圓桌會議裏，印度有三個婦女代表出席。最近的憲法中將給與六百萬婦女以參政權，四十四個婦女充任各州立法議會的議員。</p>
<p>印度婦女的活動，並不限於政治，她們對於敎育，社會的改革，社會服務和其他事情，都是興味，許多婦女充當律師醫師及敎授。</p>
<p>世界聞名的敎育家萊伊夫人是加爾各答大學的評議員。一九二七年在孟買及麻打拉薩兩大都市曾任命兩個女審判官。孟買約有女審判官十六人，麻打拉薩更多。</p>
<p>一九二○年印度不但給與婦女參政權，且任命兩婦女爲立法議員。脫拉文哥爾的女議員做了衛生部長，有名的女詩人奈端在一九二五年議會開會時期，被推爲印度國民會議的議長。</p>
<p>今年開始出席日內瓦國際聯盟委員會討論婦孺買賣問題的印度代表，也是一個婦女。</p>
<p>印度婦女在生活中覺悟她們自身所負的使拾命，遂不顧能力的薄弱，不畏前途的障碍，力謀婦運的發展，冀對人類有所貢獻。</p>
<p>（二）西班牙政府任命婦女爲特派大使</p>
<p>西班牙的有名女作家愛斯比娜女士，最近被政府任命爲特派大使，將出席一九三五年南美秘魯的建國紀念式。又聞女士將爲下次諾貝爾獎金的領受者。</p>
<p>（三）尼格拉瓜任命女外交官</p>
<p>中美尼格拉瓜大總統薩卡薩，二月前曾任命女外交官二人，一爲美國瓦其尼亞的副領事阿兒吉露女士，一爲喀利霍爾尼州山第哥的領事洛眉露女士。</p>
<p>（四）日本現有職業婦女統計</p>
<p>商業使用人－九九萬八千二百六十一人</p>
<p>交通業－－－九九萬七千二百五十一人</p>
<p>工塲勞動者－三百七萬五千人</p>
<p>家事使用人－五七萬二千八百六十四人</p>
<p>外加從事農業的農村婦女，日本有職業的婦女，實佔全人口十分之三·六</p>

<p>麥昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈平定不前之勢、以洋麥報價、上落無幾、當開價時、因業內外之買賣、久未减退、是以交易寂寞、一無出入、迨至下午開盤、因粉市疲而復堅、且洋麥雖暫無加稅之說、後則未能確定、故近遠期買氣、比較暢旺、價亦提起二三分不等、照國麥底碼、步枯而言、後步尙有見好之機會也、結果本月份較好三分、二月份好三分、餘無珷</p>

<h3 id="c270">爲麵包而麵包 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 沈利蘇記</p>
<p>中國國貨公司麵包部女職員</p>
<p>花日英女士談</p>
<p>去年的冬天我在「晏摩氏」女學讀完了中學最後的一課，算是完成了學識的路程的一個段落；在熱烈的莊嚴的畢業禮中，我在校長慈祥滿面的笑聲裏接到一張畢業證書了。</p>
<p>在「校門八字開，無錢莫進來」的商業化的大學，雖然是有不少的在開着門等待着，歡迎有錢的子弟進去，可是我究竟不是貴族的小姐，所以祗好不想做那粉紅色的幻夢。</p>
<p>同時我還想到縱然進了大學，究竟在那裏是不是可以滿足我求知的慾望？而且在那裏縱或有許多高深的學理値得我去學習，但，是不是能合將來的社會的需要？這些問題之與我不繼考大學，也多少是有點關係。</p>
<p>在不信任現代大學敎育的觀念下，我便决定了斷絶學生的生活，做一個社會實際工作的勞働者。當我把這意見向家庭提出時，長輩們都不同情地加以駁斥。他們的意見和社會一般壓抑女職業的人們的理由並不相上下，以爲女子職業祇是徒具虛名，實際上女子根本就没有工作的能力；甚至說，社會縱然肯讓女子職業自由發展，然而牠的目的還不過是想利用女子來吸引牠所希望的更多的對象。</p>
<p>我家庭裏長輩們是這樣的思想，社會一般人也還是離不了這種範疇；他們都是遮斷女子職業前途的光明的黑雲般的障翳。</p>
<p>後來，還是長輩們拗不過我堅定了的思想，准許我做一個智識勞働的份子。</p>
<p>我進這裏來服務的時期，是在今年的春天，到現在還不到一年；據有在這不到一年裏所得的經騐，覺得女子職業未來的發展，並不會因現社會的阻碍而至於失望。</p>
<p>公司當局對女職員和男職員的待遇却很平衡，並没有岐視的態度；不過女職員因生理直的不同，工作能力却往往不及男職員那麽的勇敢活潑。這雖是我個人主觀的感覺，但就一般的女職員在工作上所見到的實際情形來看，大槪也不會有很大的差異罷。</p>
<p>我初進這裏時只有十八元一月的薪金，但兩個月過去之後，就加到二十四元；截至最近爲止，我勞動的代價已經是有了三十元一月。</p>
<p>這樣數字的收入，說多哩？當然囉！人的慾望是無止境的，對於三十元一月的代價，是並不會感到滿足。說牠少吧？可是仔細把現社會的經濟情形看一看，我縱然懷有滿肚子的熱望，却也不得不冷淡下來。</p>
<p>我對於我勞働的報酬上，平心而說，是感到相當的滿意的；不過對於工作太機械化了，總不免有點不快的情緒，像蛇般盤繞在我的心頭，這也許就是所謂「做一行，怨一行」的一種喜新厭舊的心理的顯露。大槪凡是個職業者總免不了有一種怯懦的意識的存在，而且大多數的青年在一個有組織有紀律的集團中工作，總是喜歡動不喜歡靜的；就像我這裏雖然是個商業集團，牠管理的系統化和嚴肅的紀律却並不差似别種集團的組織，這裏對於某種貨物屬於某一部門，某個職員專管某一種職務，却是劃分得很清楚，而且嚴格的。</p>
<p>我做的這個部門，是包括在「飲食部」裏的一個「麵包部」；在「麵包部」對面還有個「糖果部」，這裏每一個部份都有個女職員，「糖果部」的就是我的妹妹－英英。</p>
<p>「麵包部」和「糖果部」的工作，就是靜的時間比動的時間長，有時雖然也很忙，但究因爲工作輕便得過份了，反而感不到興奮的趣味；不過賣麵包和糖果這種工作，簡單固然簡單極了，但有時却也非細心地處理不可的啊！</p>
<p>當一個顧客來買麵包時，就要懂得怎樣的去拿麵包才能使牠不至失却原來的包裹很美麗的形式；</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>這種工作看來好像極簡單容易，但假如稍不經心，牠是會因你的手握緊了一點而失掉原有的平整的。顧客花錢買麵包，他當然是可以自由地選擇；假如你拿着這形式弄得很難看的給他，他是會拒絶你這第一次拿出來的而不要了。如果你再拿出來的還是那樣，他是會帶着失望的心情離開這裏的；這在我們－者或者顧客，雖都知道麵包的形式美麗不美麗，與吃起來的口味並没有關係，但在大多數的顧客，他們總還是要講究外觀的形式的。</p>
<p>這裏的工作時間，是上午九時到下午八時，整整十一小時的工作，說長不算長，短却也不短，不過拿中國商店裏普通的工作時間來比較，我們的却還自是很適中的；有時雖會因了工作時間的冗長而感到精神的疲乏，但在美國的三八制度還没有實行的現在，還不能說是資本家的待遇苛刻。</p>
<p>中國商店在吃飯時還是照樣營業，這是普遍的現象，所以我們這裏當然也不能例外。在吃飯時間內是有半個鐘頭可以離開職務；每一個部份的職員都分爲幾班，輪流的到「會食堂」去吃飯，櫃檯上仍然是有人留守着在那裏做着賣買。</p>
<p>午飯是從十二時開到一時半，晚餐是從六時開到七時半，在這時間裏飯是不停地開着，有如酒樓「流水」席般地熱鬧。伙食全由公司供給，職員可不必另搯腰包；而且有少數的男職員和練習生住宿的問題，也是由公司代爲料理的。</p>
<p>很公道的說，據我所曉得的，有幾家和這裏的範圍差不多大小的公司，對於男女職員的待遇，比較的都有點遜色。這裏的薪金，初進來時是十八元，以後加起來也很快，有時加兩元或四元，最多或者六元，這得看工作成績的如何而定加薪的多少。在這點上，别的公司恐怕没有這樣的數目；而且牠們的加薪大半都有一種死板板的規定，有過一年才加的，也有一年加兩次的。這種的加薪方法，對於公司是有一種有損無益的弊病包藏在這裏面，實非公司當局輕易能够覺察得出來的。我現在就舉一個很淺顯的例子來說明這個弊病：例如一個職員知道公司的加薪是一年舉行一次的，他在平時對於職務就儘管可以疏懶，漫不經心的敷衍搪塞；但將到快加薪的時候，他又能像加足了油的機械似的興奮，精神抖擻的幹着分內的工作；在他這一勤一惰之間，公司在無形中雖受了絶大的損失，對也的薪金却還是要和對别個職員一樣增加的。這種情形就彷彿平常不肯專心讀書的學生，到了大考時就祇有「開夜車」來加緊工作，結果考試雖然挨過了，書究竟還是在他怱忙中從肚子裏又跳了出來。在一個學校裏有了這種學生，學校並不會因他受到損失；但在一個公司有了這種職員，却是公司的一種大大的危險！</p>
<p>公司當局對顧客的這種心理似乎也曾感覺到；所以在這裏出售的麵包，雖不一定盡合貴族的公子小姐的胃口，但質料粗劣的却也不肯放在這裏陳設的。</p>
<p>這裏所有的麵包種類，大槪總有十多種，另外還有數十種名貴的蛋糕。其價目從五分到幾角錢一隻不等。裝璜的美麗和包紥的齊整，往往會使一般顧客願拏出高額的代價，把那外觀美麗而實質上究竟是怎樣的味道都還不知道的東西佔有了，所以在這數十種的麵包和蛋糕堆裏，有的單是一隻麵包的裝璜就得費上幾分錢。在消費方面，我常常感到社會是一天比一天糜爛；但幸而在我眼中所看到的這一種消耗品，還是國貨工廠自己的出品，這倒給了我不少的安感。</p>
<p>我在這裏雖然是消磨了快到一年的時間，但總覺得還有許多東西値得我去細心的學習；譬如有時遇到一個不怕麻煩的顧客，我倒先畏懼起麻煩來了。這在當時我還覺得我這思想是合理的，可是事後再回憶一番，却不免臉上熱辣辣地有點赧然。因爲一個顧客來買東西，他本能的是會揀擇物件的品質和價格的高下；雖然有的顧客揀擇物件的態度並不眞誠，但他却總是有揀擇的權利。做店員的職責祇有盡量的搬出同類的貨物憑他挑選，絶没有拒絶他挑選的理由。就是有時遇到没有理性的顧客，他來買東西是「醉翁之意不在酒」，但做店員的不妨把他理解一下，再分别想出應付的方法，絶對不要因了顧客的態度輕浮而給他以某種不好的打擊。因爲這在公司失掉了一個顧客，固然受到很大的損失，但同時還無形的影響到整個女子職業的前途，而這損失却是難以估計的。在這不合理的社會中，女子職業的前途，是遍佈着荆棘；假如我們没有斬除荆棘的勇氣，那還是早點回到家庭中準備做人家的賢妻良母倒來得爽快！</p>
<p>我剛進麵包部工作時，曾遇到過不少帶着惡意來買麵包的顧客，那時我眞想不再幹了；可是後來究竟是理智戰勝了環境，那些不善意的顧客似乎也感到了壓倦，逐漸的也少了，到現在簡直可以說是全然絶跡。</p>
<p>公司對於職員應付顧客的態度，也很認眞，絶對不許職員有不顧禮貌的態度。現在還辦了一個練習生的訓練班，訓練一些商業的常識及應用的英語。練習生白天的工作，是一面在商塲實習應付顧客的禮貌和營業的技巧，一面在各部份傳送發票和點收貨銀。</p>
<p>話已經說得很多，應該停止了；不過又捨不得放棄這次談話的機會，所以我索性說一個痛快罷！</p>
<p>最近，時常接着許多不知名者的來信，很關心我的私生活：甚至有的還勸我不要到跳舞塲去，不要從事無謂的交際，這眞使我看了又是慚愧又是感激！天呀！究竟這些寫信給我的人都是善意的嗎？在這充滿了罪惡的社會環境裏，我實在不敢相信，因爲我的家長有時對我也没有這樣的關切。不過，在這裏我却又不能不感激人家的盛意而有所表白。</p>
<p>很坦白的說罷，每天十一小時的工作，已經够消融我全部的精神；從公司裏回來，往往兩條腿會回不住自己，再要到跳舞塲去享受那種狂歡，祇有我自己才明白我是没有那種勇氣！</p>
<p>業餘的娛樂我不絶對否認没有；不過在偶然的精神興奮時，我是會悄悄地跑到電影院去看一次影戲，或和我妹妹在一起。其實，看小說也是娛樂之一種，所以有時小說便是我娛樂的對象；還有，打乒乓球，這是和我妹妹－－英英常時舉行的。</p>
<p>這些寫信給我的關心我私生活的人們，他的寫信的動機可不必研究他是否是善意，但他至少是連一個職業者的生活環境都</p>

<h3 id="c271">從智識分子過剩說起 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 柳辛</p>
<p>整個世界在不景氣中，「失業問題」已使多數政治家經濟學者感到束手無策。自然，智識份子的過剩，使智識份子的出路，更多了一層困難。</p>
<p>中國人對於讀書，向來抱的觀念是「功名主義」，廢了科舉却產生了一種新科舉：小學畢了業猶之中了秀才，中學畢業生又無異中了舉人，大學文憑，自然就是狀元及第的契劵。傳統的「學而致仕」之結果，多數人多趨向於文法科，大多數智識份子的出路，是早已指定了政治的門了，可是政治的門太狹小了，於是文法科大學生只有陷於過剩失業的道路上。至於學實科的大學生，也一方面因民族工業尙未發逹，一方面或因缺乏眞實技能，他們不得不同樣陷於徬徨失業的道路上。</p>
<p>從大學畢業生的職業運動大同盟中已的反映了這現象的一切。</p>
<p>智識份子於政治上旣不得其門而入，於是降格以求，羣趨於敎育界以資糊口。敎育科文科法科種種等等畢業生，都以敎育界爲尾閭，以敎育界爲候缺所。因爲中國敎育尙未發逹，中學數量與每年小學畢業生數的比例，相差尙遠，政府一時又尙没有財力增加學校數，因是私立學校方如雨後春筍，大量設立，以容納這羣過剩的大學生。這種學校，尤以上海爲多。</p>
<p>吾人再進而一檢其學校內容：論設備，當然簡陋不堪，若能將敎科書充塞書橱而成圖書館，又能略備幾副儀器玻瓶而成試騐室者，這學校尙稱上上的；論課程，一因敎師待遇低下，自然難有優良敎師來充任，又爲學校經濟打算，科目大多簡單缺漏；，敎師缺課，更成家常便飯。</p>
<p>最使辦理私立學校的人殫精竭慮者，厥唯招生問題。蓋私立學校經濟的生命，完全寄托在學生身上。單就上海而言，私校林立，學生來源有限，因此不得不廣張羅網，利用廣告之不足，復利用學生或家長的弱點，極盡吸收引誘之能事。這是確實的事：據說各私校暑期招生在各報端所花的廣告費，非五六百元不辦。嘻嘻－堂皇學府，一變而爲市儈招攬雇客之塲所；如此敎育，若謂中國敎育不失敗，寗有天理！</p>
<p>當然的，學校與學生的關係，旣建築在金錢的關係上，而並不是根生於學問研究上，故學校中管理與敎學，難能施以嚴格的制度，乃必然的結果。只要你一走進學校，就可以聞到裏面充滿了囂張凌亂的氣息。嘗聞個中人謂：「嚴格不來的！一嚴格，學生會跑了的，八九百元一月的房租，數十人的口糧，從何取償呢？」這實是「誅心之論」啊！</p>
<p>農村破產啦，天災與人禍，使農村中中等以下階層更接近於貧窮綫了。大商店大公司正在狂喊大减價大拍賣大犧牲的時候，我們的學府，也正因學生或家長的購賣力之薄弱，營業也十分蕭條。我們的智識份子——學府的主持者，觀乎事業行將慘遭失敗，不能不作最後的掙扎，提出减低學費的辦法，這與大公司大商店之「特别」大放盤，「拚命」大减價同其意義。可憐的，來學的學生，還是不能如預期的增加起來。</p>
<p>問題漸漸擴大了。房租，膳食，俸給，······從何取給呢？——敎員索薪，校長捲逃，繼之學校封閉······一幕幕層出不窮的出現於敎育界中。</p>
<p>這不僅是單純的敎育問題，而實已錯綜的構成了一個社會問題，若不從政治上正本清源，及將經濟機構放置在平穩的基石上，則這種現象也許正方興未艾呢！</p>

<h3 id="c272">追悼史量才先生 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 徐雉</p>
<p>史量才先生於上月十三日下午在由杭返滬途中被暴徒槍擊逝世了，此項驚人的不幸消息早已傳遍中外，震動了一般社會人士的心靈。現在雖已過去了將近一月的時間，但此案尙無破獲的消息；同時，滬上各界人士又以痛感先生之慘遭不幸，將爲先生舉行盛大的追悼大會，以表哀悼；吾人處此情形之下，對於先生之遭此不幸，眞不知將以何種言詞以表示內心之悲憤了！</p>
<p>先是是本館總經理。其接辦「申報」是民元以後的事情。但「申報」業務之能日益向前發展，並能有目前的狀態者，可以說完全是先生以其特有的才能努力籌劃的結果。現在，「申報」每日銷行十餘萬份，卽其所有的各種附刊亦爲廣大的讀者所愛護；同時在「申報館」下所設的各種附屬事業，如業餘補習學校，流通圖書館，年鑑，月刊等等，對於中國文化，中國社會都有不容否認的貢獻。所有这些事業，雖不能說完全是史先生一個人的功績，但史先生是實現這些的主要動力，却是毫無問題的。現在，「申報館」的各種文化事業正在發展，而作爲這些事業發展的主要動力的史量才先生却不幸去世了，這不僅是「申報館」之損失，而且也是中國文化界一種重大的損失！</p>
<p>同時，史量才先生不僅努力於文化事業，而且還積極提倡一般社會事業。如其與黃弈住君創辦「中南銀行」，與項松茂君創辦「五洲藥房」與陸費伯鴻君創辦「中華書局」，及其創辦「民生紗廠」等，對於中國社會都有極大的衽益。在「一二八」事件中，整個上海都陷於極危險的動亂狀態，多數同胞都是終日惶惶，不知所措，恰於此時，先生卽出而發起建立「上海市地方維持會」，以應付一切；所以，待到改爲「地方恊會」時，先生仍被任爲正會長。此外，先生所担任的職務很多，如市參事會議長，招商局理事，紅十字會名譽會長，中山文化敎育館的董事等等，這些都是極重要的職務，與中國社會都有極大的關係的。所以，先生所遭的不幸，不僅是中國文化界的損失，而且也是整個中國社會極大的的損失！對此不僅中國文化界的人感到了深切的哀傷，卽一般社會人士亦覺得非常悲憤！</p>
<p>現在，滬上各界人士追悼史先生大會的日期已快到了，在這號哭遍地傷心慘目的當兒，編者除希望政府早日將此案破獲，並希望社會人士，勞苦大衆繼續史先生的精神，努力於文化及一般社會工作外，特作此文，以紀念史先生，非僅爲表示哀思已也。</p>

<p>没有理解清楚總是事實。我不是怨怪人家寫信給我，不過在寫信的人自己至少是應當審愼一番，究竟這種信寫去有什麽意義？</p>
<p>好罷，我的公私生活都說在這裏，以後關心我的人們，大可以節省幾分郵票和消費的精神，把牠移用在本身事業的發展上吧！</p>

<h3 id="c273">一種售貨法 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 樂笙</p>
<p>售貨是有售貨的藝術的。有一種店員能够使用方法呌賣主甘心情願的購買　的貨物；還有一種店員，不但不能招徠顧客，還會因了他對於售貨技術的無知，而把對於某種貨物中意了的顧客攆走。這種不同，當然是由於售貨技術高明不高明的緣故。</p>
<p>售貨技術當然很多，可以隨着各人的聰明去利用。但有一種極原則極普通的售貨術，也就是我在這裏所要講到，是爲一般的店員們所不可不熟習，不可不加以大大的注意的。這是根據心理學上的「重複」（Repition）原理而奠基的一種售貨術。「重複」原理是這樣的：「對於某一事象若能加以適度的重複，則能引起人們更大的興味與注意。」例如這裏有五張廣告，若分散在五個地點粘貼，其効力常不及貼在一個地點來得大，因爲一個單張常不易引起人們的興味和注意。我們常在街頭看到京戲館和影戲院的「海報」總是多張合貼，就是這個道理。人事上也頗多這種例子。我們常有這種經騐：當我們要到二三里路遠的某地去時，心裏對於坐黃包車與否原没有一定的主張，若這時路旁忽然接二連三地有許多黃包車夫來兜攬生意，那說不定我們就會坐上了其中後來的一部。「終身大事」也常會因爲「屢次屢次」的不斷「追求」，而能獲得圓滿的結果。售貨的道理也正和這一樣。當主顧到來的時候，不消說你得很和悅地拿出貨物請他檢選，你得不憚煩地一次，二次，三次，四次······的貢獻你的貨物到他的面前。只有殷勤的服務才能說服買主，而得到他的歡心。你得像黃包車夫搶生意似的，或像一個追求伴侶的青年似的，再接再厲地，不失掉你的進取的機會。一個並不怎末對貨物中意的顧客都會在你的殷勤下折服，他們一定會選擇一件貨物購買的。（普通最後拿出來的貨物被選擇的機會多）</p>
<p>應用這種一而再，再而三的「重複」原理，而在售貨術上成功的人是頗不少的。就本國來說，華北的店員們要比華中華南的更懂得這原理些。在華北，那些較有牌面的店舖，如布莊，銀號，手飾店之類，你一進去，他們便會把你請到裏面特設的客堂裏去坐，茶也來了，烟也來了，要的貨物也一一拿來了；卽使你不中意，他們也不會見怪的，仍客客氣氣送你出去。中小店舖，也大都是客氣的多，絶不像上海某些大店舖裏的店員們，對於那對貨物不大中意的顧客要露不愉有不耐之色，甚至要駡一聲「猪玀」或其他侮辱的話的。實際，對顧客客氣是絶對的必須。須知得罪了一個顧客，就是少了一個顧客。靠顧客吃飯的人怎末可以作這種不利於己的事呢？</p>
<p>日本人大都是善於經商的，比中國北方人甚至還要懂得其中的訣竅。他們對於「重複」原理的應用，從他們對顧客的絶不放鬆一點可以看得出來。無怪日本商人能够在世界各角落裏都有他們的足跡而能無往不利的了。</p>

<h3 id="c274">批評，謾駡，漂亮文章 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>一個公正的批評者，他對於他所批評的人或作品「不哭也不笑」，他只是說明其對處或錯誤及其所以那樣的原因。自然，在他的說明中，有時也不免要對他所批評的人或作品表示尊重或「責駡」，但假如他的立塲是正確的，他的理由是正當而且充分的，那麽，由此所引出來的「尊重」或「責駡」，便不是什麽「捧塲」或「謾駡」，而是客觀的眞理。</p>
<p>然而，謾駡絶不是批評；批評是講理的，謾駡則是無理取鬧！近來有些寫「批評文章」的人就不明白這個道理，他們不要理論，只是駡别人「荒謬」「混蛋」，而不指出其「荒謬」「混蛋」之所在；有時甚至完全離開所討論的問題，專門在别人的姓或名上大著「文章」；這樣的「批評」，便算不得批評，只不過是無理的謾駡罷了。如果一切學術一切問題的研究和爭論，必要有理論的內容，才能使研究和爭論進步，才能日益使我們接近眞理，那麽，以謾駡來代替批評的先生們，在客觀上，便是妨害研究和爭論的進步因而也是朦混眞理的人物了。</p>
<p>以謾駡來代替批評的先生們說：有些人是不可以理喩的，對這種人講理，實際上等於對牛彈琴，所以只好給他一塲瞎駡－－這樣的論調，在表面上倒像是很英雄的，但如根本說來，則便是故意廻避問題的無能表現了。因爲批評的文字，不僅是爲被批評者寫的，主要的是爲一般讀者而寫，牠不僅要拿給被批評者看，而且還要拿給一般讀者看；但能使被批評者詞窮理盡的，是正確的理論，不是「一塲瞎鬧」，一般讀者所探討的更是正確的理論，不是什麽「駡人藝術」。所以假使誰要以謾駡去代替批評，不管其「理由」如何，則都是不能對付正當的客觀要求的無能表現。</p>
<p>如果此種以謾駡來代替批評的現象繼續發展，那麽，不僅一切研究和爭論都要受到妨害，恐怕連批評本身都有被消滅的危險。請想想看，倘若大家都認爲以謾駡來代替批評是對的，所有寫批評文字的人都以各種各樣的藉口，拚命在瞎駡其所批評的人上顯耀自己的「才能」，那結果還會有批評嗎？所以，爲批評的命連計，我們也不能贊同以謾駡來代替批評的任何理由。我們需要顯明眞理，我們要求有理論的批評和爭論！</p>
<p>與以謾駡來代替批評一樣，不管其所寫的批評文字在理論上對不對，只想寫成一篇詞句美妙結構出奇的「漂亮文章」，這也是不對的。我們知道，詞句文章，是用以表現我們的思想與感情的。一定是先有了某一思想和感情，然後才有適合於表現這思想與感情的詞句，文章；就是專門在詞句上講究的唯美主義，專門爲詞句的華麗和對仗努力的中國的駢文，也都是在一定的思想與感情下產生的。理論，乃是思想與感情之系統的組合，所以，我們寫批評文字必須以理論爲中心，以詞句爲次要－詞句是表現理論的工具－，不能專講詞句的華美，以致陷入於「以詞害意」的泥坑。例如，當我們要批評某人的理論時，我們自己必須有一理論體系，在此理論體系下去找適合於表現我們意見的詞句，以寫成一篇理論的批評文章；在這中間，卽使有許多美妙的詞句，俏皮的駡人語，意義深奧的古典，如果是不適合於表現我們的理論的，那也應該割愛不用；否則便會犯「以詞害意」的毛病。自然，當我們表現自己的理論時，一定要注意到詞句的美妙有力，文字的結搆等問題，因爲假如我們能以最生動的詞句，最完善的文字編　法將我們的意見表現出來，那在理論上所發生的作用必然是很大的。但是，這也是怎樣才能更好地表現我們的理論的問題，不是以推敲字句爲主的意思；假如你不像這樣，一定要爲了美妙的詞句，爲了俏皮的駡人話，而去作「批評文章」，那麽，不管你個人內心上得到了多大的安慰，不管你會怎樣地誇耀你的文章的「俏皮」，「漂亮」，但結果，一般讀者都是要說你「華而不實」淺薄無聊的！</p>
<p>老實說，所謂漂亮文章，乃是在進步的理論下產生的，如果你没有把握着進步的理論，那便不會寫出眞正漂亮的文章；所能寫出的，只是空洞的或無味的荒謬的文章。不信，就請你寫一篇以擁護帝國主義者的理論爲中心的文章出來看看，那不管你是怎樣善於作文，我敢說，結果必然是醜態百出！</p>
<p>總而言之，我們需要理論的批評，不需要謾駡，也不需要「華而不實」的漂亮文章。</p>

<p>民國二十三年十一月十三日史量才先生被人暗殺了，在青天白日的滬杭公路中被人暗殺了。我們對於這一樁公案，除悲慟外，還有什麽話可講呢！但對於先生之死，却不能看作一件普通的生離死别，隨着大家說幾句哀悼話就算了。</p>
<p>我們追念先生，景仰先生，是因爲先生不僅是中國報界的唯一的領袖，而同時也是中國民衆敎育的唯一導師的緣故。如果先生不以民衆利益爲前提，申報决不會有今日悠久光榮之歷史；如果先生不以敎育民衆爲目的，報紙本身事業以外，决不會再有社會敎育事業之創設。因此之故，我們不得不來紀念這樣的一位偉人，我們的導師。</p>
<p>我們追念先生，景仰先生，我們知道先生出身於大衆，能知民間疾苦。申報流通圖書館，業餘補習學校，婦女補習學校都是建立在這一認識上，成爲申報社會敎育的重要工作。因此之故，我們來紀念這一位偉人，我們的導師。</p>
<p>我們悲悼先生爲了先生死於非命，爲了社會事業而犧牲，使先生偉大的志願，不能儘量貢獻於社會，不能爲多難的國家効力，我們不禁爲國家與社會的精華悼惜！</p>
<p>我們追念先生，悲悼先生，是在先生偉大的人格上，爲社會而犧牲之最重要的意義上。因此，我們要來追悼先生，不注重虛應故事而是另有一番繼承遺志之意義。</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>哀慟罷！悲號罷！墮淚罷！一切都無用！我們要的是積極意義的繼承先生的偉大的志願，踐踏先生旣開的道路，邁步前進！</p>
<p>與申報社會敎育直接間接有關係的同學們！廣大的申報流通圖書館讀者們！你們想與史先生作最後一次話别嗎？你們願意向着史先生的影前一吐你的傾慕與哀情嗎？</p>
<p>因此，就由我們學生們及輔助先生敎育事業之同人發起這追悼大會。會期定於十二月十日（星期一），在「寗波同鄉會」舉行。</p>
<p>届時甚盼全體同學及廣大的申報流通圖書館讀者個别的參加。</p>
<p>同時也收受紀念先生的文聯，及其他紀念品。凡一切文字，我們還擬彙印成册作爲一種重大的紀念。如有這些東西的，請於十二月九日前送南京路大陸商塲三四五號申報流通圖書館或靜安寺路斜橋弄七十五號申報婦女補習學校。</p>
<p>我們追悼不重形式；但同時也不能不要形式！但我們尤其注意的是我們追悼的意義，希望凡預備來參加大會的人，以嚴肅的意義來向先生頂禮！來說明自己的志願！來繼續先生未竟之志。</p>
<p>希望覺申報直接間接有關係的同學們及廣大申報流通圖書館的讀者們，全體動員來參加史先生的追悼大會罷！</p>

<p>— 蘇鋼</p>
<p>這隻六丈多長的大船，在這淺狹的贛江裏打個回身，的確不是一椿容易幹的勾當。三十多個船夫，手上緊握着篙子在那裏撑着；頭上出籠饅頭似的冒着熱氣，額角上的青筋蚯蚓般地突起着，汗像山澗裏的水船地從頭上淋了下來。船老板站在篷桅跟前，不停地吆喝着：「來！個邊下一篙。好，左擺！」</p>
<p>他手裏握着一根四尺來長的烟桿，上勁的呼着；一會兒指揮前面的水手，一會兒又吆喝後面的舵工，手和嘴一下兒都不曾間着。我看了他那副嘴臉，不禁笑了起來；我忙走過去望着他喊了聲：「老板！」</p>
<p>他冷不防我突地這一喊，他的身子幌了幌，回頭一看是我，忙堆着笑說：「你老！」</p>
<p>「我看，你比他們還吃力點吧！我站在那裏望了半天，你的手和嘴簡直没停過一下！」</p>
<p>「唉！」他㧞下嘴裏含住的烟桿，嘆了口氣，然後又笑着說：你老不是知道吃個碗飯的苦處，像我們這條船就是我的家當，一有人都要靠着吃喝的；一天不走就一天没有飯吃，要是不小心碰個窟窿就糟了！他們是不管這些賬的，船碰破了不走，他們可往别條船上去幹的。」（未完）</p>

<p>Opinions of Both Sides Still Far Apart</p>
<p>Meetings Still Needed in the Coming Days to Continue Discussions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the demarcation of the Hebei-Peiping boundary, the Ministry of Internal Affairs convened a meeting of representatives from both sides on the 8th to discuss it. Zhang Yinwu, Hu Yuanhui, and Zhang Lisheng, members of the Hebei Provincial Government, attended. Zhang Yinwu said that the Peiping municipal area is about 3,000 square miles. The municipal government plans to expand the area, incorporating the entirety of Daxing and Wanping counties and part of Changping, which would expand the city area to more than 16,000 miles. In no country in the world, such as London or New York, is there such a large area. The provincial government raised two points of opposition: (1) The provincial and municipal boundary lines delineated in 1928 should be the boundary between Hebei Province and the city. (2) Security, sanitation, and so on in the areas where the province and the city meet can be negotiated and carried out by both the province and the city. Today, the Ministry of Internal Affairs convened a meeting of both sides, and they attended to make representations based on these two points. Beyond this limit, it will be necessary to request instructions from the provincial government for approval. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 2 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, the Ministry of Internal Affairs convened representatives from Hebei and Peiping to hold consultations on boundary demarcation at the ministry. Gan Naikwang presided.

The meeting went well, but the opinions of both sides were still far apart. A second meeting will be held in the coming days to discuss the matter further. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The residents of Wanping County held a village meeting at Fengtai at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. Each village sent three or five representatives to attend. They resolved: (1) To telegraph the Hebei Provincial Government and representatives Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Yinwu, and Hu Yuanhui attending the boundary demarcation meeting that the residents are determined to maintain the old boundary in this province-city boundary demarcation and that the residents will not recognize it if an inch of land is划 into the city area. There is a petition from the residents of Wanping County, Gu Shiwu and others, numbering over 300,000. Three copies each of the roster of the three village representatives have been made, one presented to the county government, one handed over to this district, and one retained by the representatives. The Daxing, Wanping, and Changping County Residents' Opposition to Boundary Demarcation Fengtai Office was established on the same day to facilitate the work. Gao Xurong, one of the first batch of petitioners to Beijing, has returned north. According to him, after they arrived in Beijing, they first went to the Executive Yuan to petition. The Executive Yuan stated that this matter was being handled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. They went to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but because the ministry was busy with the handover, there were no results yet. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 5 PM this afternoon, Yu Xuezhong paid a visit to Huang Fu to report on the inauguration process and request instructions on all future initiatives in Hebei Province. He will return to Tianjin tonight. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong said that the provincial government meeting has decided on the principle of using the original boundary as the boundary in the province-city boundary issue. Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Yinwu, and Hu Yuanhui have been appointed to go to Beijing to participate in the meeting. It would be difficult in fact to abolish the county government or划 out a certain area. Because within a certain county, if a certain area is划 out, the entire county government will be affected. Therefore, it seems difficult to talk about划 the Nanyuan, 大小湯山 and other places into the Peiping area for the time being. What the outcome will be still depends on the Beijing boundary demarcation meeting. Since the Executive Yuan resolved to move the Hebei Provincial Government to 保, the official order has not yet been received, so the official relocation date has not yet been determined. It is now the middle of winter, and the relocation procedures are inconvenient. At the same time, if the provincial government moves, the arrangements for provincial defense will also be slightly changed. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e36">Japan Announces Abolition of Naval Treaties <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The initial intention of Japanese diplomatic circles regarding the abolition of the Washington and London Naval Treaties was to first obtain tacit consent from Great Britain, and to coordinate with France and Italy to take unified action to abolish the treaties. Unexpectedly, Great Britain advocated closer ties with the United States, which prevented the plan to collaborate with Britain from succeeding. France and Italy were especially unwilling to offend Great Britain and the United States for the sake of Japan's interests and also rejected Japan's proposal. Consequently, Japanese diplomacy had to reconsider its approach. An immediate abolition of the treaties would not only deepen the opposition from the United States, but also hinder the progress of political cooperation between Britain and Japan. Furthermore, the military, which holds real power, held different views from the government's proposals, and the general public largely supported the military's position. Therefore, Japan could not wait for the outcome of preliminary talks and directly advocated unilaterally declaring the abolition of the naval treaties. The decision to abolish the naval treaties has already been made by the cabinet and, following the precedent of withdrawing from the League of Nations, will be submitted to the Privy Council for deliberation. This is merely an administrative formality, and the abolition of the treaties is a certainty, it can be asserted.</p>
<p>Japan believes that its national power has expanded outwards. Although its maritime trade is second to Britain and the United States, it surpasses that of all other countries. It is only natural that it should have naval power on an equal footing. However, to seek British understanding, it is practically impossible not to acknowledge the superiority of the British Navy. But practically, it must be on an equal footing with the United States. After the abolition of the treaties, Japan will no longer be bound by their restrictions. First, it can increase its naval power according to its so-called national defense needs. Currently, the Japanese Navy only leads the world in submarines. However, military experts often believe that this is only a defensive weapon. It is not yet possible to take offensive actions across the 5,000-mile Pacific voyage. Secondly, first-class cruisers like the "Nachi" class are superior to those of Britain and the United States. However, the quantity is small and the tonnage is not large. It is impossible to surpass large battleships. Therefore, after the abolition of the treaties, these defects can be quickly remedied, and armaments can be freely expanded. Secondly, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty has not been able to restrain all of Japan's actions, but it has often been a focus of international controversy. Japanese diplomacy has been repeatedly criticized. The League of Nations often uses it to stir up some diplomatic ripples. If the United States and Britain were to insist on the Open Door policy in the Far East, Japan's military actions in the Northeast would also be constrained. Previously, Britain and the United States each had their own agendas and their diplomatic paces differed, so Japan was able to obtain some benefits. If the situation changes and Britain and the United States reach an understanding, Japan's difficulties will increase sharply. For Japan, it is best to abolish the treaties.</p>
<p>Some say that what is beneficial to Japan is harmful to the United States. If Japan's proposals are fully implemented, the United States will have to be subject to Japan's control in Far East trade. Great Britain will also gradually retreat to the west of Singapore, adhering to India. Perhaps they can temporarily coexist and maintain a surviving situation. However, the United States of North America must develop overseas markets, and develop investment and export trade in order to save its economic crisis and lay the foundation for future prosperity. Great Britain has been painstakingly managing the Far East for more than 90 years. Its economic foundation is quite solid, and its political power is also not weak. It will certainly not willingly give up and obey others.</p>
<p>Now that Japan has declared the abolition of the treaties, the United States will inevitably abandon the obligations conferred by the Washington Treaty, that is, the exchange condition of the 5:5:3 ratio, and build military fortresses in the Philippines and Guam. It is feared that competition in warship construction will be unavoidable. Britain and the United States are well aware that the focus of naval warfare in the future is not on heavy battleships, but on agile aircraft. The number of aircraft carried by American aircraft carriers exceeds eighty, and the sailing speed is 33 knots per hour, which is considered the best in the world, especially not the enemy of Japan. Under this situation, Japan only has to expand its armaments to protect its interests.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Once Naval Treaties Are Abolished, the United States Will Devote Efforts to Expanding the Air Force <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Navy Is Determined to Maintain Its Superiority Over Japan</p>
<p>Studying Japanese Plans and Then Deciding Whether to Proceed</p>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today that the State Department and the Navy Department are preparing to deal with the situation after Japan announces the abolition of the treaties. However, it is predicted that the cancellation of the treaties may not immediately trigger a naval race, and it is believed that within the two-year period after the Japanese government announces the abolition of the treaties and before the treaties expire, the Navy will probably be quiet for a while. The State Department is now working hard to plan for the continuation of naval restrictions, and the naval authorities intend to take the opportunity to study Japanese warship construction plans to prepare for the United States. An official told the Associated Press reporter today that the so-called U.S. warship construction plan after 1936 is only a temporary speculation in terms of the type, number, and size of battleships, because the detailed warship construction methods must be determined based on the plans of other countries. However, some U.S. naval authorities believe that the U.S. warship construction plan should focus on building aircraft carriers, seaplanes, and high-speed heavy cruisers so that they can keep pace with air fast ships. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Yesterday, the U.S. chief representative to the Navy, Davis, issued a statement in London, saying that after Japan announced the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaties, Japan would be responsible for the impact. The U.S. government believes that although Davis issued this warning, Japan will inevitably announce the abolition within two weeks. As for the response methods, the U.S. seems unwilling to act hastily so as not to harm the current relations between Japan and the U.S. or cause a general naval competition in the world. Officials firmly advocate the necessity of maintaining the superiority of the U.S. Navy, while stating that the Washington and London Naval Treaties will not actually become ineffective until the end of 1936. The State Department and the Navy Department both want to use the next two years as a naval construction truce period and, during this period, work harder to find a compromise basis and establish restriction principles, and then decide on the procedures to be taken by this country after the Japanese naval construction program is clarified. Regarding the naval competition, Japanese Ambassador Saito delivered a speech in Boston, saying that Japan does not want to take this action, and people here are very satisfied, believing that what Saito said means that Japan, at least within two years, does not want to compete with the United States in naval construction. Apart from this, the U.S. government also hopes to renegotiate naval talks under more favorable circumstances in 1935. Yesterday, Wen Sheng, chairman of the House Naval Committee, declared that if Japan builds three battleships after abolishing the Washington Naval Treaties, the U.S. should build five to maintain the 5:5:3 ratio. It is said that those around President Roosevelt do not agree with this statement. Some people here claim that the Navy may immediately begin building 78 warships to replace warships that have reached the end of their service life, which is also unknown, but when Congress meets next January, the government may not propose an important warship construction plan. The Navy Department's current plan only has a total of 24 ships, but the naval community may not be satisfied with this. His enthusiasm for building ships still needs President Roosevelt to work hard to suppress it. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e39">A 30% Qualitative Reduction: Great Britain Declares Its Position <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Containing Japan</p>
<p>(London) On the 6th, U.S. representative Davis initially issued a formal statement on naval issues. Regarding the re-proposal to reduce the naval power of all countries uniformly, the British government has declared the British government's position on qualitative restrictions on the 7th. In particular, it expressed its willingness to reduce the maximum tonnage of battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers uniformly by 30%. The above situation is to counter the case of Swanson, the U.S. Navy chief, who reduced the naval power of various countries by 20%. The core of the British arms reduction case is clearly expressed, which is quite noteworthy by the general public. At the same time, as the only solution to break the deadlock in the preliminary consultations, it seems to contain a restraining meaning when Japan requests to present a specific plan. The main points of the statement are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>The British government has always opposed the excessive expansion of battleship and aircraft carrier cruiser types. It was also advocated at the Geneva Three-Nation Conference that the maximum tonnage of the above ship types must be reduced by 30% uniformly. At the same time, there is also a proposal to reduce the caliber of the guns. The British government is even proposing to reduce the maximum tonnage of the above types of warships and intends to accept it now. The majority of the major naval powers have already recognized the above proposal, etc. (Jiji Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Arms Reduction Becomes Arms Expansion: Japan Opposes British Proposals <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The British government issued a statement advocating that the tonnage of single ships such as battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers should be reduced by 30% uniformly. Although the Japanese government has not yet received a formal telegram, the navy authorities have not yet made their opinions public. However, the general situation of the intentions within the Navy Department is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Although the content of the British 30% uniform reduction case has not yet been ascertained, at the Geneva Anglo-American-Japanese Conference, Britain advocated reducing the tonnage of single ships. It is feared that the same is true for this proposal. At the Geneva Conference, Britain advocated that the maximum tonnage of battleships be 25,000 tons, aircraft carriers be 21,000 tons, and cruisers be 7,000 tons. Compared with the tonnage in the existing treaties, the battleship is limited to 35,000 tons, the aircraft carrier is 27,000 tons, and the cruiser is 10,000 tons. Therefore, the battleship is reduced by 10,000 tons, about 29%, the aircraft carrier is reduced by 5,000 tons, about 19%, and the cruiser is reduced by 3,000 tons, about 30%. The overall situation may be called a 30% reduction.</p>
<p>(2) Arms reduction can be divided into two aspects: quantity and quality. To achieve true arms reduction, the quantity should be reduced first, restricting the holdings of each country, and then the quality should be reduced, and the attacking forces should be abolished. However, what the British government has announced this time has not touched on the arms reduction in quantity in any place. No matter how the arms reduction in quality is carried out, if the quantity is not reduced, it will not become a true arms reduction. This goes without saying. (3) It is said that in the existing treaties, the British cruisers must not exceed 50, so no matter what, they must advocate the use of 70 ships. As for battleships and aircraft carriers, the number of current ships is also necessary. If what Britain advocates becomes a reality, then reducing the tonnage of single ships and calculating the total holding force, then its tonnage will not only not be less than the current quantity, but will also increase the trend. The so-called arms reduction may even become an arms expansion.</p>
<p>(4) If the British government's statement is indeed the case this time, it is because the U.S. delegation has expressed its opinion, advocating a uniform reduction of 20%, so it will compile this number from the past advocacy of reducing its quality to confront the United States. This may not be imaginable. (5) The United States advocates reducing 20%, and Britain advocates reducing 30%. Both are temporary propaganda and cannot be considered to contribute to a truly fair and just arms reduction agreement. (Jiji Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>New York to Guangzhou is 10,000 Miles</p>
<p>Only 72 Hours to Reach</p>
<p>(New York) The U.S. Aviation Corporation announced today that Quick Plane No. 5 will fly from Miami to California at the beginning of next year, taking charge of the Pacific airline to Guangzhou. The test flight of the giant aircraft in the Caribbean Sea has been successful. It is now preparing for a test flight on the San Francisco-Honolulu-Manila-Guangzhou route to provide resources for aviation personnel. It will take several months to open a regular airline, but airmail may be realized within a year. The giant Martin transport aircraft used for the regular airline has a total of four, each weighing 25 tons, with a speed of 180 miles per hour and a range of 4,000 miles in one breath. It takes about 72 hours to fly from New York to Guangzhou, a journey of 10,600 miles. The airline will fly once a week at the beginning. It is also heard that the company will operate a passenger airline from the capital of Argentina to Harbin. If an agreement can be established with Soviet Russia, the airline can also be connected to London. If so, the only missing link in the global airline is the Atlantic Ocean. According to the current Pacific airline plan, passengers can have dinner in New York, breakfast in San Francisco the next morning, breakfast in Honolulu the next morning, lunch in Mid-Island, and dinner in Guam, and breakfast in Manila on the third morning.

(Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Rome A conflict occurred this morning on the border between the independent country of Abyssinia in East Africa and Italian Somaliland. About 400 Abyssinian people carrying guns and cannons suddenly attacked Italian soldiers stationed in Werder. On the Italian side, 60 people were killed and 400 were injured. Then two Italian bombers flew to aid and dropped several bombs, and the Abyssinian people dispersed. It is reported that many people were killed and injured. The Italian government has now made representations to the Abyssinian government, demanding a satisfactory reply. According to Abyssinian sources here, the Abyssinian government was not involved in the attack. According to the border between Abyssinia and Italian colonies in East Africa, there are often disputes over the border line and pasture. In mid-November, an Italian consulate in Gondar was attacked, killing one person and injuring several others. After serious representations from Italy, the Abyssinian government agreed to compensation. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>The Ordinary Diet Session Is Approaching and Will Be Even More Eventful</p>
<p>The Seimin Coalition Movement Suffers a Major Setback</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the softening of the Seiyukai, although the political crisis has been avoided, the attitudes of the various political parties towards the government have been exposed due to this issue. It is natural that the Minseito adopts an attitude of maintaining the government, but the National League's anti-Seiyukai attitude and its intention to maintain the government are quite noteworthy in the content of the party. As for the internal opposition relationship of the Seiyukai, it has been exposed, and it is now even more blatant. Its future is difficult, which cannot be denied, and it seems that there are still many problems left in the party's control, and the Seimin coalition movement, which is gradually on track, will also experience great obstacles due to this. Its future is even more worrying. As for the Tokonami faction, which continues to be in a state of alienation, it is also necessary to determine its position and feel the need. The government, in view of the solid and difficult experiences of this session of the Diet, should have the need to re-examine its policy towards political parties.

<p>Combating Pseudo-Reform and the Japanese Exclusion and U.S. Agriculture Issues</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi and Foreign Minister Hirota Respond Separately</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Research Group and other factions of the House of Peers are very indignant at the current situation where the Diet has been delayed in deliberation due to the Seiyukai's proposed bomb-like motion, and the atmosphere of supporting the government has become stronger, becoming a state of exciting the government. The House of Peers' General Budget Committee opened at 9:40 a.m. yesterday. Baron Okura Kimmochi of the Koseikai questioned Prime Minister Okada on the Manchurian immigration issue, and then pressed the Prime Minister to express concrete aspirations regarding the national policy of Manchuria. The Prime Minister replied that not only will the independence of Manchukuo be supported and preserved, but also various forms of cooperation will be implemented to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity. Okura asked how Minister of the Army, as Director-General of the Manchurian Affairs Board, is fully responsible for Manchurian affairs in general. Is the activities of the Manchurian Affairs Board a transferring or decision-making mechanism? Are all Manchurian affairs carried out by the Affairs Board? What is the relationship between the Affairs Board and other government departments? Regarding the Kwantung Governor-General, who has full power in Manchuria, and the Kwantung Army, which has the higher authority? Is there no confusion? Why must active-duty soldiers be placed under the Kwantung Governor-General? Is the Kwantung Army's Special Affairs Department abolished, or is there a similarly transformed mechanism? What is the reason for the Army Chief of Staff serving concurrently as the Director-General of Affairs? Minister of the Army Hayashi replied that the first point is to closely respect the independence of Manchukuo and the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchuria. Director-General of the Legislative Bureau Kanamori replied that the Affairs Board is a supplementary mechanism to the Prime Minister and does not directly exercise its will. Those that should be unified from the viewpoint of the national policy toward Manchuria are carried out by this mechanism. The matters managed by the Kwantung Governor-General and the Commander of the Kwantung Army are different, so there is no confusion. Appointing the Commander of the Gendarmerie to be the Chief of the Police Department is not to turn the Gendarmerie into police, but to unify police affairs. Okura asked that it is regrettable that the Kwantung Governor-General participates in general industry and economic matters. The Prime Minister replied that I intend to entrust him with industrial and economic matters in a broad sense. Minister of the Army Hayashi replied that the official system has not yet been announced. I mean that the Kwantung Governor-General cannot handle the affairs of Manchukuo. Okura finally stated his hope that the official system would be decided according to his intention. The meeting adjourned at 10:40 p.m. The closing ceremony will be held as scheduled at 10 a.m. on the 10th. (Dentsu, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers plenary session opened at 3:07 p.m. today. First, Chairman Konoe reported that Matsuda Masayuki had been elected Baron Councilor, then the agenda was changed and questions were asked of the ministers. First, Tsumura Jusha (Research) raised the issue of Japanese exclusion in Arizona in the United States, saying that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest to the US authorities had no effect, and the subsequent acts of Japanese exclusion had not improved, thus showing that the authority of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest was not recognized, so what does the Foreign Minister believe? Foreign Minister Hirota replied that there was no regret in the actions of ambassadors and consuls stationed abroad. The Japanese protest pointed out the very serious errors in the measures taken by the Arizona authorities in the United States, and the US side also attached considerable importance to it, so the Arizona authorities and the US central government are now working to improve the situation. However, it is truly unimaginable that the acts of Japanese exclusion have not ended. It is doubtful whether it is the act of the Americans whom I respect. Tsumura asked whether acts of Japanese exclusion are still continuing, and none of the perpetrators of the violence have been arrested. There is no room for doubt. It is clearly a barbaric act. Does the Foreign Minister intend to make further protests? Foreign Minister Hirota replied that it is very doubtful whether it is the act of the Americans, or the act of foreigners who have immigrated to the United States. In today's international political relations, which are very complicated, we must be wary of conspiracies that merely seek to alienate Japan and the United States. However, in order to protect the interests of Japanese residents, we will seek ways to demand compensation for damages. Finally, Mr. Tsumura requested serious action, and Foreign Minister Hirota also agreed. The meeting adjourned at 4:09 p.m. Another plenary session will be held at 10 a.m. on the 9th to pass the proposed disaster budget. (Dentsu Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>Litvinov Explains Intentions</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov agreed that during the negotiations on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, neither party would enter into any "bilateral agreements." A TASS reporter inquired with Litvinov about this matter, and Litvinov replied, "The signing of an agreement between France and Russia proves, first and foremost, that both sides are seeking mutual rapprochement and are committed to international cooperation to consolidate peace. This ambition remains unchanged." Litvinov continued, stating that both Russia and France view the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact as a necessary factor in stabilizing European peace, and the two governments are determined to continue their efforts to achieve it. This can also be seen in the recent agreement signed by the two countries. The threat of disrupting peace still exists. Although the authorities of a certain country have issued unilateral declarations, claiming to cherish peace, the threat of disrupting peace has not been eliminated because of this. Moreover, in addition to this peace declaration, there are also declarations of the opposite nature. Therefore, to eliminate the threat, it is necessary to establish objective, definite, and material guarantees. The Franco-Russian agreement was signed on the 5th of this month, and there is still the possibility of signing other agreements in the future. This agreement does not restrict France and Russia from continuing to sign other agreements in the future. However, no matter what agreement, its purpose is definitely not against a third country, but in the case of being invaded, it cannot be generalized. If other countries can join this agreement, the mutual relations between the signatory countries will be no different from the regular relations between France and Russia. I deeply believe this. Soviet Russia has always hoped to establish the best possible relations with Germany. If the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact can be established, good relations can be established between France, Germany, Russia, and other signatory countries, and the international political situation can be comforted and stabilized as a result. This is what Europeans desire. Various measures are currently being taken internationally, and the sole spirit is to maintain peace. For example, the resolution of the Saar issue is one aspect of this. The agreement signed between Russia and France echoes this kind of measure," and so on. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e53">Heated Debate Between Representatives of Yugoslavia and Hungary at the League of Nations Council Meeting <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yugoslav Foreign Minister Accuses Hungary of Being Responsible for the Marseille Incident</p>
<p>Says This Action Has No Political Effect in Maintaining Peace</p>
<p>Hungarian Representative Refutes, Insisting on Revising the Peace Treaty</p>
<p>France and the Little Entente Countries Clearly Show Support for Yugoslavia</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council met at 3 PM yesterday to discuss the dispute between Yugoslavia and Hungary. The chairman, Portuguese representative Vasconcellos, reported the start of the meeting, and then Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yeftich stood up and read a declaration in a peaceful and firm tone, largely restating the memorandum previously submitted to the League of Nations. He said that Yugoslavia had to accuse Hungary of being responsible for the Marseille assassination in order to maintain peace. The Yugoslav government did this because terrorist parties are rampant in Hungary and have become a raging fire. Yugoslavia believes that responsibility lies where it should and that there is no turning back. Having said this, the Yugoslav Foreign Minister reiterated the evidence cited in his memorandum one by one, and finally solemnly declared that this action by the Yugoslav government has no political effect whatsoever, but only seeks a legal judgment. After the Yugoslav Foreign Minister finished his speech, Hungarian representative Eckhardt stood up to respond, taking about 45 minutes, refuting each point made by the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, and recognizing it as a planned movement by Yugoslavia to slander Hungary for several weeks. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council held a meeting, the first to discuss the Yugoslav application. No unexpected events occurred at the meeting. Most of the foreign representatives and journalists were present. The chairman of the Council, Portuguese representative Vasconcellos, first read Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant, which stated in its second section that any situation affecting international relations that could disrupt international peace or the good understanding on which international peace depends, any member of the League has the right to bring to the attention of the Assembly or the Council. The chairman then invited Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yeftich to speak. Yeftich rose and delivered a speech, saying that the Yugoslav application revealed the responsibility of the Hungarian administrative organs and government for the Marseille incident. Its purpose was to maintain peace and had no political effect whatsoever. Yeftich stated the reasons according to the application, and strongly stated that Hungary should be held responsible. Yeftich said that Yugoslavia is also willing to expand the scope of discussion to establish an international agreement to punish terrorism. Hungarian representative Eckhardt denied all the events revealed by Yugoslavia, saying that the Marseille assassination was not prepared in Hungary. The late King Alexander of Yugoslavia was put to death by revolutionaries, and the revolutionaries were active outside of Hungary. Eckhardt also said that the peace treaty created a kind of revolutionary situation, and the Marseille tragedy was its manifestation. Eckhardt then said that only by revising the peace treaty can peace in Central Europe be maintained and international cooperation be achieved. The Hungarian representative also refuted the accusations of the Little Entente countries, saying that it was a political means and asked the League of Nations Council to investigate. (Note: After the Yugoslav government submitted an application to the League of Nations on November 22, the Czech and Romanian governments also sent official documents to the League of Nations separately to express their sympathy to Yugoslavia.) After Eckhardt finished his speech, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu stood up to answer, saying that since Eckhardt regarded the official documents sent by the Little Entente countries to the League of Nations as a political means, then the Hungarian reply to the Yugoslav application (Note: The Hungarian reply was postponed to the 8th after gentle persuasion from Britain and Italy) must be submitted for public discussion and refuted, otherwise this debate cannot be concluded. Chairman Vasconcellos then said that after the Hungarian reply is submitted, all related countries can reply on Monday. Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü said that before taking common measures internationally, all related countries should take necessary sanctions to stop terrorism. Czech Foreign Minister Beneš then took the floor to explain the reasons why Czechoslovakia fully agreed with the Yugoslav application. He said that Czechoslovakia's intention was nothing more than to use the power of the Council to eliminate the current conflict and prevent it from happening again. Beneš also said that for some time, some people have been plotting to endanger the integrity and security of Czechoslovakia on the northern border of Hungary, and the situation is the same as what the Yugoslav application said. The newly created countries of Central Europe are striving for unification, which has been the case since ancient times, and conspirators want to prevent the trend of unification among countries. If someone wants to destroy the unification of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, or Romania, it will lead to an inevitable disaster. "I specifically declare this important point," and so on. Beneš's remarks clearly indicate that the League of Nations has the function of pacifying incidents. The next meeting is scheduled to be held at 3 PM tomorrow. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Situation of the League of Nations Council Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council held an open meeting. French Foreign Minister Laval expressed his opinion, saying that the accusations made by the Yugoslav government against Hungary were shocking. The reason is that the Yugoslav government has repeatedly requested the suppression of terrorist parties because Hungary is sheltering them, but the Hungarian government has ignored them. Laval believes that Hungary has an obligation to reinvestigate and praised the calm attitude of the Yugoslav government. As for the Hungarian representative Eckhardt's proposal to revise the peace treaty in the Council, it is inappropriate, saying, "Anyone who moves a piece of the existing boundary marker is disrupting peace. Since some time ago, assassinations have occurred frequently, which is a shame for civilization and a threat to peace." He also said that Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that all member states of the League of Nations should avoid any actions that could endanger the territorial integrity of other countries. France is now planning to put forward concrete suggestions to regulate the "right of countries to detain political prisoners." (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Thinly Clothed and Empty-Handed, Crowded at the Border</p>
<p>Schools and Hospitals Temporarily Provide Shelter</p>
<p>Yugoslavia's Actions Will Lose International Sympathy</p>
<p>Thousands of Hungarian nationals expelled by the Yugoslav authorities in Szabadka are still staying here, in a very miserable state. Schools, hospitals, and other buildings are temporarily sheltering these people, waiting to be transported elsewhere one after another. Other border stations are also full of these refugees, thinly clothed and empty-handed, suffering unspeakable hardship. Rozski, a town not far from here on the border, is now in a state of panic. The boundary line between Yugoslavia and Hungary is only a small dry ditch, but the peace treaty signed by the two countries calls it a waterway. According to a dispatch from Reuters correspondent in Budapest, the number of Hungarian nationals expelled from Yugoslavia and who have arrived in Hungary to date is 2,436. Many more are waiting to be transported to the border by car. It is now believed that all 30,000 Hungarian nationals in Yugoslavia will be expelled. The Hungarian government has launched a national fundraising campaign to provide relief to these refugees, and donations are quite enthusiastic everywhere. Serbians now despise Hungarians more and more, and it is expected that the border will be closed in a few days. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The "Daily Telegraph" commented on the dispute between Hungary and Yugoslavia, saying, "Border cases between the two countries, if not intentionally provocative, originally did not need to be overly pessimistic. However, if the expulsion of Hungarian nationals from Yugoslavia continues unabated, then the danger is very great. In short, the current dispute between Hungary and Yugoslavia has become a raging fire, and the national sentiments of both sides have been aroused to the highest degree. Its future is truly worrisome." The "Times" said, "If Yugoslavia expects the world to sympathize with it because of the attack by the Croat terrorist party, then this sympathy has largely disappeared due to the recent treatment of Hungarian nationals by the Yugoslav government."

<p>Total of Five Battalions, Britain and Italy Each Contribute Two</p>
<p>British Officer to Serve as Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>Switzerland Does Not Participate, Netherlands Has Not Yet Replied</p>
<p>(Geneva) The subcommittee composed of British General Temperley, Italian General Visconti, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, and Saar Region Administrative Committee Chairman Knox held a meeting this morning to discuss various proposals regarding the dispatch of troops to the Saar, so that they could be submitted for discussion at the closed-door meeting of the Council at noon. It is said that the international troops will total about 5,000 personnel, under the command of a British officer. Sweden and the Netherlands have not yet given a definite reply on whether to participate. On the contrary, the Swiss Federal Administrative Committee, after receiving a semi-official invitation, has expressed its unwillingness to participate, on the grounds that Switzerland does not have standing troops that can be sent abroad. At its noon meeting, the League of Nations Council decided to expand the Saar three-person committee (namely, Italy's Alessio, Argentina's Gandilo, and Spain's Madariaga) so that each country sending troops could send one representative to join as a military expert. These international troops will consist of five battalions, including two British battalions, two Italian battalions, and one battalion jointly sent by the Netherlands and Sweden. They will enter the Saar before Christmas this year (December 25). After the expansion of the three major committees, they will be responsible for drafting the organizational details of these international troops and submitting proposals to the Council.

<h3 id="e57">Litvinov Speaks on the Saar Issue <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) At the League of Nations Council meeting, the report of the Third Committee on the Saar issue was discussed. Litvinov said, "The so-called Saar issue is most relevant to the two major nationalities, has less impact on the signatories of the Treaty of Versailles, and as for other countries such as the Soviet Union, this issue is only related to being a member of the League of Nations. Its responsibility is only for the resolution of general peace issues and the effects after its implementation. From this point of view, we do not need to explain why we fully agree with the suggestions made by the Third Committee (based on the agreement of the two countries concerned). However, there are several issues that must be taken into account by all members of the Council. These issues relate to the fate of the Saar people, which is still in the hands of the League of Nations Council. Fortunately, the Saar people will soon be able to decide their own fate. At that time, we will process their decisions made in a free and unhindered plebiscite. The right to self-determination that we speak of often refers to the right of the people of a certain place to join any country or establish their own government. If the Saar people have such possibilities, then we believe that any decision they make will be the final decision, and at the same time, the Council does not need to worry too much about their fate. Unfortunately, this case has a special feature, that is, its decision can be called unprecedented in international practice, and the theory of international law has not seen it before. Specifically, the Saar people can not only merge with any of their neighboring countries, but also continue their existing regime. This change of power is obviously temporary. We firmly believe that this decision is only adopted temporarily for special reasons, so it is no wonder that the various groups in the Saar and individuals participating in the plebiscite have repeatedly inquired with the Council and certain committees about the legal importance of this decision. At the same time, they inquired whether this decision is final in nature. In other words, after this decision is passed, will the Saar people permanently lose their right to self-determination? It is not surprising that the committee had to answer these questions. The committee has determined that if the result of the plebiscite is in favor of maintaining the existing system, then the Saar governance will be transferred to the League of Nations. At that time, the League of Nations will be able to use this governance to slightly change the legal status of the Saar. If the most relevant countries do not interfere in the slightest, then the Saar people also eagerly hope that the League of Nations' maintenance of power should have no other purpose than to safeguard the peace of the League of Nations. Therefore, in the future, if the Saar people clearly express their willingness to change their legal status, then the League of Nations must not deny their right to self-determination unless it uses the reason that they could not use their right to self-determination before." Litvinov then recalled the solemn declaration made by the foreign minister of one of the countries most concerned about this issue, who said that his country would never interfere with this position of the League of Nations. Litvinov then said, "If another major country concerned with this issue can come to this occasion again (this is what I eagerly hope for), will it raise objections? I dare to assert that it will not. In this arena, I believe that the other member states of the League of Nations will never reject the legitimate request of the Saar people to make a revised decision for temporary reasons." Litvinov continued, "I have no suggestions. What I said is only to explain why I agree with the opinions put forward in the committee report. These opinions are consistent with the principle of self-determination and my interpretation, so I do not object to this report. I hope that the passage of this report will be able to meet the wishes and interests of the Saar people and all parties concerned, and will be able to promote world peace." (TASS Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The famous novelist H.G. Wells recently published the second volume of his autobiography, in which he described his meeting with former President Hoover in the US Presidential Palace, saying that President Hoover was "overworked, resulting in a state of weakness and incompetence." Now, former Hoover Secretary Lee has made a correction, saying that Wells' book is fictitious and close to insulting, and that Wells was never allowed to meet, and had never entered the White House, because Hoover did not grant a meeting. Later, at the strong request of the British Embassy, Hoover hastily met Wells in his office for no more than two minutes. Now he uses this hasty meeting to write a book, falsely claiming that President Hoover is weak and incompetent, and that routine official matters are mostly piled up for a month. It is not known what he is basing his claims on. He also said that the White House is messy and disorganized, which is also out of fantasy, because during Hoover's tenure, he never set foot in the White House.

<p>The average number of private forecasts for cotton production in New York this morning was 9.6 million bales, but the government estimates may be slightly higher. It is said that even if the government report is more, its impact on the cotton market will be insignificant, because cotton can be used to offset government debt. The cotton market opened at a price two pounds higher. Since there was no pressure from sellers, and the industry also bought in slightly, the price continued to rise slightly.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat futures opened slightly higher because the Liverpool telegram was still good, and world wheat prices also improved due to news that the United States had imported foreign grain. It is heard that the freight rate for Mississippi River cargo ships from New Orleans to St. Louis is five cents per bushel for Argentine oats, so foreign wheat can compete with domestic wheat prices.</p>

<p>Before the opening of the New York securities market, the favorable factors for the market were that there was no general reaction in the market and the popularity was still good, because various businesses continued to move upward. The unfavorable factors for the market were: (1) The commodity market showed signs of reaction; (2) The broker's debts increased this week, indicating that securities have shifted from stronger hands to weaker hands. Speculators will therefore become more cautious. Securities opened weaker this morning, but the decline was mostly limited to single digits, except for Union Carbide stock, which was two pounds lower. According to general opinion, although the upward trend has not really stopped, it is expected that many parties will gradually close out positions.

<p>Mutual Trade Development</p>
<p>Increase in Farmers' Income</p>
<p>Republicans spare no effort to attack President Roosevelt's new policies, but for more than a year, they have not seen any special effects. However, the United States assumes that if it does not implement the N.R.A. policy and does not convert to a new policy, there is no other better way to change the general economic decline in the United States today. However, one point worth noting is that after 1930, all countries in the world implemented protectionist trade policies and increased tariffs, resulting in a tariff war. The higher the tariff barriers, the smaller the foreign market, and the domestic market does not necessarily have room for development. After suffering this lesson, the United States deeply knows that this policy cannot be fundamentally changed, and it is not enough to change the current congested state of world trade.</p>
<p>Therefore, the United States is preparing to reduce tariffs and implement mutual benefit agreements. The first country to conclude a mutual benefit agreement with the United States was Cuba. The implementation of the mutual benefit agreement began on September 3 this year. According to the calculation at the end of September, the total amount of Cuban sugar imported into the United States from January to August this year was only 73 million pounds, while in September alone, it was 153 million pounds. This is truly an amazing miracle. The US exports to Cuba have also increased significantly. For example, the exports of wheat flour to Cuba last September were worth 197,000 US dollars, and this September increased to 298,000 US dollars. Cotton yarn was worth 3,800 US dollars last September, and this year it increased to 16,000 US dollars. Pork lard was only worth 38,000 US dollars last September, and this year it increased to 298,000 US dollars in the same period. Cured meat also increased from 23,000 US dollars last year to 93,000 US dollars this year. Looking at Cuba alone, this number is certainly very small, but for the entire US trade, the value of exports in September was 196.69 million US dollars, and the value of imports was 131.659 million US dollars. The export surplus was 65.031 million US dollars. Although the number is not very large, it is the largest export surplus since 1931. It is the result of implementing mutual benefit agreements and reducing tariffs. In the future, mutual benefit agreements will be discussed with South American countries, Belgium, Spain, etc.</p>
<p>This autumn, the domestic economy is still in a state of stagnation. The industrial production index has continued to fall since May. In September, it was the lowest record since March last year. The working capacity of the steel industry was only 18.4% of the total production capacity in early September, and by October it had not fully recovered to 26.3% of the total capacity. Compared with the figure of 57.4% of the total production capacity reached in June this year, it is less than one-half. The biggest reason for the decline of the textile industry is that 400,000 workers were on strike for more than three weeks. In September, the average weekly production of cotton was only 70 million square yards, which is also less than half of the first half of the year. Other industries such as cement industry, automobile industry, etc. are lower than last year.</p>
<p>Since industrial production has declined, the situation of workers will inevitably worsen. According to the survey of the American Federation of Labor, the number of unemployed people in September was 10,951,000, which is 11,700 more than in August, and 843,000 more than the 10,108,000 in September last year. The increased number cannot be said to be small, and the economic future cannot be said to be stable.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, there is a strange phenomenon, that is, this autumn, retail sales in various department stores are very good. Whether it is the index of department store expenditures investigated by the Federal Reserve, they have maintained very high figures in August and September. Why do department stores have such good sales during the industrial recession? One is that the wage reduction in various industrial sectors is very small, and all those who are employed retain their original purchasing power. The second is due to the drought. Agricultural products are restricted by nature, and market prices rise, so the purchasing power of farmers is slightly higher. The third is that the government spends a huge amount of drought relief funds. With this subsidy, the rural economy is more active. According to the economic report of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the purchasing power of farmers in August this year increased by 44% compared with March last year. However, this optimistic material is ultimately lacking in permanence. Even if the general society is stimulated by the "New Deal" and shows some lively scenes, if the industry cannot be revitalized, the future hope is still not great. It can only be seen after the implementation of the mutual benefit tariff agreement, or there may be a turnaround in the international community. (October 29 in New York)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Transfer of Hebei Provincial Government to Baoding May Not Be Realized Before the New Year <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Baoding Lacks Sufficient Housing</p>
<p>Joint Office to be Implemented on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, The relocation of the Hebei Provincial Government to Baoding has been rumored for a long time. Initially, because the officials were tight-lipped, the public could not know the details. It was not until the Executive Yuan passed the case a few days ago that the officials allowed it to be announced. However, Provincial Government Secretary-General Wei Jian said yesterday that the central government's order had not yet reached the province. The provincial government has been moved from Bao to Tianjin for a long time. Once it moves back to Baoding, there will be many difficulties, such as the lack of large houses suitable for joint offices. Even the former Cao Family Garden of the old provincial government has been abandoned for many years and is dilapidated. If it is repaired, it will take a considerable amount of time. It is feared that it will not be possible to move there before the solar new year, or even before the lunar new year. There are rumors that the provincial government has sent people to Bao to repair the houses, but that is not the case. Since the Hebei provincial capital was moved from Tianjin, all undertakings have been declining. Now that there is news that the provincial government will move there, the society has suddenly become active. Major stores and banks in Tianjin and Ping have gone to inspect the location and expand their business, and the prices of houses in Baoding have increased.</p>
<p>According to Yu Xuezhong's intention, the joint office of the provincial government will be realized on January 1 next year. After the joint office, the organizational law of the provincial government and various departments will be drafted with reference to the current example of Hubei Province and the special circumstances of this province. The provincial government will set up a secretariat with four sections under it. The first section will be in charge of receiving and sending, general affairs, and accounting. The second section will be in charge of personnel and transfer. The third section will be in charge of statistics and auditing. The fourth section will be in charge of inspection and examination. In addition, a security office will be set up to unify the security teams in the war zones of the province, the Hebei Provincial Security Team, the newly編 Special Police Team, the county defense groups, and the police public security teams. The four departments of civil affairs, finance, education, and construction were originally four-section systems. After the joint office, the first section will handle general affairs, which will be under the charge of the first section of the provincial government secretariat. Each department will only have three sections, and the number of personnel will be reduced by about one-third compared with the present. Because the province is implementing the abolition of exorbitant taxes, which is limited to the end of the year, the only way to compensate for the insufficient funds is to start with reducing government expenditures, so the joint office is also taking the opportunity to save on payments. The old provincial government houses in Baoding are smaller than the current Tianjin provincial government. In the future, when moving to Bao, the various departments will have to merge a part in order to realize the joint office.</p>
<p>Before the provincial government moves to Baoding, it plans to first eradicate the banditry in the province. This was decided at the 589th routine meeting of the provincial government on the 4th of this month. Elite troops will be selected from the 51st Army to suppress the bandits in separate routes. Currently, the most rampant banditry in the province is in Yongqing and Gu'an, secondly in Wuqiang and Suning, and thirdly in Xinhe. Among them, Xu Erhei's gang in Yongqing, with about 300 people, has been wreaking havoc in the surrounding counties. The provincial government believes that although the bandits are rampant, they can be easily wiped out by the formal army. The logistics supply is being properly planned by the provincial government. Once the 51st Army selects the troops, they will be dispatched separately. (6th)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Financial Disturbance in Chaozhou and Shantou <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Cash Cannot Be Transported to Chaozhou and Shantou Anymore</p>
<p>Credit Crunch Creates Stagnation in Various Industries</p>
<p>Authorities Issue Announcements Strictly Prohibiting Disturbances to Travelers</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence, Chaozhou and Shantou have been experiencing industrial and commercial decline, rural desolation, a credit crunch, a rise in foreign exchange, and an increasingly chaotic financial market in recent years. The Department of Finance approved merchants and citizens to issue commercial treasury certificates of 10 million yuan based on real estate for relief. However, when the issuance was approaching 4 million yuan, a fake treasury certificate scandal occurred. The credit of the treasury certificates and the original guaranteed banknotes was lost at the same time. In order to consolidate their credit, most silver firms transported cash from Shanghai to Shantou. Since October, the amount of cash imported has been no less than 3 million yuan. The silver industry association and its member silver firms formed a mutual aid association to exchange banknotes on a daily basis, preparing to exchange the banknotes for commercial treasury certificates for use in order to achieve uniformity. Currently, the soft currency circulating in Shantou City includes guaranteed banknotes, circulating coupons, auxiliary coins, and white tickets. According to the Department of Finance's order, they must all be exchanged for commercial treasury certificates within the specified period. White tickets are gradually being recalled, and the amount is about 1.2 million yuan. Other guaranteed currencies are being registered. The new commercial treasury certificates are being printed by the Xinhua Company in Hong Kong and are divided into four types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 30 yuan, and 20 yuan, each with 2.5 million yuan. If the new certificates are printed and issued, the old certificates must be cancelled, and various banknotes can no longer be used in the city. During this transition period, the financial market is chaotic, with no standard price. Exchanging banknotes for cash requires a surcharge of 11 yuan per 100 yuan. There are four types of banknote prices: the Provincial Bank's silver dollar coupons are the highest, the banknotes of reputable silver firms are the second highest, the banknotes of non-convertible silver firms are the third highest, and the circulating coupons issued by the Chamber of Commerce after being closed are the lowest. Commercial treasury certificates and white tickets have a face value of 100 yuan per sheet, and the price changes several times from morning to night. It is difficult to use currency in Shantou, and there are losses in both collection and change. The Eastern District Office, upon the request of the Chamber of Commerce, announced that people are not allowed to refuse to accept soft currency or create disturbances when exchanging it, and violators will be punished as disrupting financial order. However, soft currency can only be used in the Shantou urban area and cannot circulate in the counties and villages. Every winter solstice, when soil sugar is on the market, sugar merchants need cash to purchase soil sugar from the villages. In addition, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia send remittances back to their hometowns, which are particularly numerous at this time, exceeding 3 million yuan per month. Overseas Chinese remittance agencies also need cash to distribute remittance silver to the villages.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Chaozhou and Shantou have always been import-surplus ports. Merchants handle a considerable amount of goods in winter, and the amount remitted to Hong Kong to repay debts each month is no less than 10 million yuan. Remittances also require cash. When cash is scarce, the Hong Kong-Shantou exchange rate is particularly high, requiring a surcharge of 380 yuan per 1,000 yuan of Hong Kong paper, which is unprecedented. According to the exchange rate, bringing cash to Hong Kong can yield a net profit of more than 180 yuan to 200 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Therefore, the smuggling of cash for export is increasing, and the cash on the market is becoming increasingly scarce. The means by which unscrupulous merchants transport silver for export are quite clever, either melting it into silver blocks, or casting it into gold bars, or hiring young children to take a small amount of cash on board in shifts and hide it in secluded places. All kinds of tricks are used. The customs and police discover the matter of gold and silver being smuggled every day, with an average of more than 10,000 yuan per day. However, legitimate travelers are suffering from harassment. The Department of Finance issued an announcement stating that each person is only allowed to carry 20 yuan of silver and must not exceed the limit. However, some merchants and travelers who carry more than ten yuan for travel expenses, or even only a few yuan, are also searched. Ordinary travelers are in tears, complaining everywhere. For example, in the market towns of coastal counties, local products such as pigs, cattle, vegetables, and green fruits are usually transported to Shantou for sale. However, after selling them, cash cannot be taken out. If remittances or delivery methods are used, there is no cash available in the counties. The Chamber of Commerce of Lufeng County specially requested the Shantou authorities to allow merchants and citizens of the county to carry cash back to the county, but the authorities did not approve it, because it is very convenient for fishing boats to travel between Lufeng and Hong Kong, and they are afraid that cash will flow out of the country. Shantou Chen Bingchun and other silver firms felt that there was an urgent need for cash on the market, so they handled 1.2 million yuan of cash in Shanghai, preparing to transport it to Shantou, but it was stopped by the Ministry of Finance and could not be transported. The Exchange Association and the Overseas Chinese Remittance Association sent telegrams to Shanghai requesting its release, but it is said that they were all ineffective. According to merchants, the reason why the Ministry of Finance does not allow cash to be transported to Shantou and Xiamen is that last month, Shantou silver merchants distributed 400,000 yuan to Shantou, but later they calculated that it would be profitable to transport it to Hong Kong, so they did not unload it in Shantou. The Ministry of Finance believes that merchants only have this plan, so they resolutely stopped transporting silver south. Currently, the only way for the Chaozhou and Shantou authorities to relieve the financial situation is to carry out searches for smuggling, even if travelers complain and the countryside is desolate, they do not care. However, the Department of Finance recently issued an announcement to Shantou, stating that Huang Xiuting's letter stated that smuggling of silver for export by unscrupulous merchants should be strictly prohibited, but customs officials and police are taking the opportunity to make a fortune, taking all the proceeds of the search into their own pockets, and even ignorant women and children who do not understand the prohibition, or pass through the coastal areas of Hong Kong and Macao, must take all their belongings with them.</p>
<p>However, once they enter the dock or get on a small boat, regardless of whether they are smuggling, they will confiscate all their silver coins, and even the 20 yuan that is allowed to be carried will not be given. This kind of lawless robbery is more serious than the smuggling of silver by unscrupulous merchants, and those who are robbed occur every day. There are also repeated reports in the newspapers, but it has not been heard that the government has taken any measures to stop it. Therefore, the disturbances at the fire ship docks have been rampant in recent days, with customs officials and police colluding with each other, and merchants and travelers are uneasy and public opinion is boiling. If this continues, what kind of world will it be? Ting witnessed and heard it with his own eyes, and he could not bear it any longer, so he had to submit his complaint, requesting that the aftermath be handled well, etc. The order prohibiting the export of silver has been announced by this Department many times, and it is on record that each person must not carry more than 20 yuan. Those who are within 20 yuan are of course allowed to carry it freely. Now it is said that customs officials and police are taking the opportunity to harass them in the name of inspection, and even the 20 yuan in cash that is allowed to be exported within the limit is being confiscated. If this is true, it is very inappropriate and should be strictly prohibited to reassure merchants and travelers. This announcement has already arrived in Shantou, but it is not known what its effect will be.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Limitless Joy <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the fifteenth, the Korean Consort's cavalry bid farewell and returned. A small gift of tea was presented, along with a letter of gratitude, entrusted to them for delivery to Commander Ma. Shiban Jing (Stone Slab Well) is a waist station with sweet, cool well water. From the former mountains, one retreats southeast, while the northwest offers a vast, flat expanse. About five or six hundred miles away, a long, wide curve can be faintly seen, its silver light sparkling, floating high in the sky. If it were said to be clouds, it lacks the light, floating appearance. If it were said to be mountains, the surrounding area is all azure sky. This is the Tianshan (Heavenly Mountains) snow peaks that traverse Xinjiang, dividing the province into two.</p>
<p>The Tianshan mountain range originates from the Kokshal Tau Mountains between Xinjiang and Central Asia, running east between the Ili and Weigan Rivers, where it is called Khan Tengri Mountain. Passing Dihua, it is called Bogda Mountain, and ends east of Hami, called "West Mountain" and "East Mountain". The entire range is highest at Khan Tengri (translated as King of the Heavenly Mountains), reaching 21,000 feet. The south side of the mountains is called the Southern Route of the Tianshan, and the north side is called the Northern Route of the Tianshan. In the past, when Zuo Zongtang entered Xinjiang, he passed through here and once exclaimed, "Feeling happily as if returning to my hometown." Now, gazing at it from hundreds of miles away, one cannot help but feel boundless joy.</p>
<p>Setting off at noon, one looks around at the sand dunes, towering and stretching endlessly. The journey follows a dry sand river westward, with the Tianshan Mountains intermittently appearing, as if half-buried beneath the horizon. The red sun shines brightly, and white clouds swirl around the mountainside like a jade belt. The terrain gradually slopes downwards, quite different from the direct ascent to Xingxing Gorge from Anxi. However, it is still referred to as "up." (Coming west from Lanzhou is called "up," and vice versa is called "down." Travelers coming and going greet each other the same way, never asking about the safety of Gansu or Xinjiang. They always ask about "dou jia," how high or how low the price is. This is because Gansu Province suffers from frequent droughts, and Xinjiang is also experiencing crop failures this year. The travelers' anxiety about food is understandable. After forty li, one reaches Shaquan Jing (Sand Spring Well), where a spring emerges from the sand dunes, as thick as the mouth of a bowl. A ditch leads the water to the roadside, forming a pool. The ditch's edge is covered with "yan ye" (small grass). The sound of the spring is clearly audible, and two wild ducks are swimming in the pool. The platoon leader first shoots one of them. The remaining duck soars into the sky for a moment, then lands again by the pool. Another shot misses, and it flies back down as before. The crowd figures that the Gobi Desert lacks pools of water, so the duck must not want to fly elsewhere. Several people are positioned to ambush the pool's edge. When the duck lands for the third time, they fire, and it is captured. The two ducks fall down, one after the other. The platoon leader rushes over to butcher them, reciting a few scriptures during the butchering. This is because the Hui people believe in Islam and do not eat animals that are not slaughtered and contain blood. The platoon leader then uses small stones to tell fortunes, saying that three soldiers were sent out this morning to hunt wild animals. According to the divination, they can obtain one thing. If it is not a wild horse, it must be a yellow sheep. Later, the three soldiers returned empty-handed.</p>
<p>Shaquan Jing was originally a large station, but the shops have been completely destroyed. Only two postmen live there, and their lives are quite difficult. At the stations east of Malian Jing, the postmen's monthly salaries increase yearly, with a minimum of twenty-five yuan per month, and as much as forty or fifty yuan. If they work for nearly twenty years, they can receive a pension of one thousand yuan. This kind of treatment is roughly the same in the provinces within the Guan (passes). West of Xingxing Gorge, the postmen at each station receive 300 taels of Xinjiang silver notes per month. Half of this is used to buy iron shoes for the riding donkeys needed for their work. The remaining 150 taels, calculated at 400 taels per silver yuan, is only equal to 3 jiao, 7 fen, and 5 li. They dig cynomorium (a type of parasitic plant) to fill their bellies. Sometimes, the Hami authorities provide a few catties of white flour, barely enough to survive. It is known that the postal routes in Xinjiang in recent years are difficult to traverse, unlike the smooth roads in the interior. This is likely not entirely due to the influence of local politics, but rather the postal service itself has a shortage of income, insufficient to cover expenses, which affects the work. This is a major reason. The postal service within the Guan is developed, with a surplus in income and expenditure each year. If the surplus could be used to help the deficient, and given strong support, each additional county or station that is opened would bring more practical benefits to that county or station. Whether the frontier's transportation will develop in the future depends on this. The authorities should not ignore this. Traveling forty li west from Shuiquan Jing is Yaodianzi (Waist Shop), also known as Geda Jing (Lump Well). The well is three feet square and seven or eight feet deep, lined with wooden boards, and the water is still potable. There are ruined house foundations nearby, presumably the remains of the old shop. Wild, dry reeds grow sparsely, difficult to provide enough food for camels. At night, we ate "shou zhua fan" (hand-grabbed rice), stewed with wild duck and mutton. The duck tasted fresh, but the mutton, slaughtered in Anxi more than ten days ago, had already developed a strange odor. The shopkeeper still frequently served me the fattest pieces. I could not swallow them, so I passed them to others, who said, "Thank you for the reward." Fearing that I would be put in a difficult position again, I secretly told the Han cook, "zhua guo zhe" (the one who grabs the pot), to secretly do me a favor from now on, whether it was rice or noodles, and not to put meat in my bowl. He laughed and replied, "We people are not used to eating meat, but love to eat vegetables, and are often laughed at as livestock, only knowing how to eat grass. You, sir, are originally a distinguished guest, but unexpectedly you also cannot eat meat, and you are fighting for our cause. What to do? Although, if you want to refuse meat, it is best to pretend to have a toothache, so as not to have the shopkeeper see it and blame us for treating the guests slowly." I agreed to his suggestion, and suddenly remembered that when I left Shanghai, Mr. Tang Binhua had given me the parting words "Congratulations on going to Xinjiang to eat horse meat." Now I know that the Kazakh (similar to the Hui people, but actually different) people indeed have this custom, namely, inviting guests to choose a horse first. If the guest points to a certain horse and says "good," then it is killed for the feast. The rest is seasoned with five flavors and stuffed into the original horse's intestines, called horse sausage, especially considered a precious gift for guests. Now I have a plan to pretend to have a toothache, so that when I really encounter horse meat, I will have a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>That day's journey covered eighty li, along sandy wastes that stretched as far as the eye could see. There were slight mounds and hillocks, but they did not obstruct the flat, open expanse. Grasslands were scarce, but the weather felt gradually warmer.</p>
<h3 id="e99">A Record of the Actual Survey of the Guiding-Huai River Project <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>A report from Zhenjiang: The Guiding-Huai River Project is divided into two routes: one into the Yangtze River and the other into the sea. The river route is being carried out by the Central Guiding-Huai River Committee, starting with the construction of ship locks. The sea route is being managed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 1st in Yangzhuang, Huaiyin, by Chairman Chen Guofu himself. On the first of this month, this reporter followed the special vessel of the He Zhishi, Mamao, and Jia River Works Bureau north to conduct an on-site survey. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>We set sail at 8:00 AM that day and arrived in Shaobo at 11:00 AM to visit the Shaobo ship lock project. This project is one of the three locks in the Central Guiding-Huai River Committee's plan to channel water into the Yangtze River. The first section is in Liu Lao Jian on the Grand Canal, the second is in Huaiyin, and the third is this lock. The three locks are largely the same: 100 meters long and 10 meters wide, with a lock chamber that can accommodate fifteen 30-ton ships, six 80-ton or 100-ton ships, four 300-ton ships, or one 900-ton ship. Once the three locks are completed, the water depth from Sanjiangyingkou on the Yangtze River along the Grand Canal to the Grand Canal Station, where it intersects with the Longhai Railway, a total of 350 kilometers, will be at least three meters (about one zhang in the old Chinese measurement). Ships with a draft of 2.5 meters and a load capacity of 900 tons can navigate year-round without obstruction. Both ends of the lock chamber, upstream and downstream, have two steel lock gates. The sides and bottom of the gates are all cast in reinforced concrete. The sloping sides inside the lock, connected to the bottom, are all inlaid with stone blocks. There are water pipes placed on both sides of the lock chamber bottom, connecting the upper and lower lock gates, and equipped with opening and closing mechanisms. On top of the walls on both sides of the lock gates, for ships coming from upstream, water must first be released into the lock through the water pipes to make the water level in the lock chamber equal to the upstream level, and then the upper lock gate is opened (the opening and closing mechanisms can be operated by the strength of four people), and the ship smoothly enters the lock. At the same time, ships waiting to go upstream in the chamber can exit the lock. Then the upper lock gate is closed again, and the water is discharged downstream through the water pipes, so that the water inside the chamber is equal to the downstream level, and then the lower lock gate is opened. The downstream ship in the chamber can then exit the lock and sail downstream, while the upstream ship can enter the lock, and the lower lock gate is closed again, repeating the cycle. Each entry and exit takes at most one hour. The maximum difference in water level between upstream and downstream is 7 meters and 7 cun. Each lock costs approximately 500,000 yuan and is expected to be completed in April next year. It is being undertaken by the Fu Ji Construction Company. Most of the materials are foreign goods. The project office is in Fanxing Temple in Hexi. Director Lei Xiaofeng has gone to Beijing, and Engineer Wu Qingfan is hosting the visit. The foundations of the two lock gates are currently being driven with wooden piles, and steel sheet piles are being driven outside the wooden piles.</p>
<p>At 12:00, we proceeded upstream again, arriving at Gaoyou at 6:00 PM. The next morning (the 2nd), at 7:00 AM, we accompanied Zhang Weiming, the county magistrate of Taixian, Cao Boquan, the county magistrate of Gaoyou, and Messrs. Gu Zifang and Ma Shuangang. At 3:00 PM, we passed Baoying, and Mr. Qiao Mengqian boarded the ship to join us. Xu Jiecheng, the director of the Guiding-Huai River Sea Route Project Office, arrived from Yangzhou by car, abandoning the car and boarding the boat. At 5:00 PM, we passed Huaian, and Deputy Director Chen Hefu, arrived by car from Qingjiang to welcome us, also boarding the boat to travel with us. At 7:00 PM, we arrived in Qingjiang, where Chief Engineer Ge Hanlou greeted us at the pier and we stayed overnight at the project office. The next morning (the 3rd), at 8:00 AM, Mr. Xu Ge and about 20 others who had come with him, took cars to the Gaotai section of Lianshui territory to conduct an on-site survey. The cold weather here arrived early, with a north wind like a knife, and the temperature dropped below thirty degrees. Solid ice was already visible. The cars traveled on the abandoned Yellow River embankment, the distance between the two embankments being about one li at the narrowest and beyond sight at the widest. The river channel had become low-lying land. Occasional river ponds had become stagnant water. The sandy plain was endless. Looking out into the center of the river, workers were scattered among them, working. At 11:00 AM, we arrived south of Lianshui County, and rested briefly at the Gaotai section project office. According to Chief Engineer Ge, the digging is planned to be 35 meters wide and 12 meters deep. The first year's plan is to dig half the width and depth first, so that the water does not flow through. In case of a major flood next year, this half width can also be used to discharge water, and then the other half can be opened, without affecting next year's project. Every 25 workers form a group, and each group opens about 10 meters of river channel, with measurements taken every seven days, measuring the four sides of the excavation and the soil piles in the trench. The excavated soil is carried to both banks, about 200 meters, and used as a new embankment. Workers provide their own tools and work. The depth of the work varies, with some reaching three or four meters. The soil is mostly sand, so it is not difficult to dig, but it is more difficult in the ponds. The accents of Taixian and Gaoxian are completely those of farmers, and each has its own unique melody. The Taigao sections are 14.831 kilometers long in total. Lianshui is the boundary between the two counties. The project office pays wages at a rate of eight fen per cubic meter. Each person carries about one cubic meter per day, which is not enough to feed themselves, so in fact each county must subsidize it to more than one jiao per cubic meter. Assuming that each cubic meter costs a total of 1.5 jiao, then each person can earn a little extra by carrying 1.5 cubic meters per day, to prepare for food during rainy and snowy days when work is stopped. However, it is extremely difficult for each county to raise funds. Adding taxes to the fields is also hindered by orders, and if it is not taken from the fields, then industry and commerce cannot afford it. This is the biggest problem for the future of the project. At 5:00 PM, we returned to Huaiyin. The next morning (the 4th), we took a boat to visit the Huaiyin ship lock. There were originally four locks here. The downstream lock is in the north of the city, called Dazha (Great Lock). The upstream three locks are in the northwest of the city, called Fuxing (Revival), Tongji (Universal Relief), and Huiji (Beneficial Relief). The upstream three locks are very close to each other. The original intention of the ancients in building the locks was to open and close them up and down to ease the water flow and adjust the water level, the same effect as today's ship locks, except that they lacked water pipes. However, over time, the upper and lower lock gates no longer open and close, and the water still rushes through the lock. Ships going upstream must be hauled three times, and ships going downstream are unstable unless moored. As a result, the lock workers demand money. Each ship passing through the four locks costs dozens of yuan at most, and the river winds around a large bay, adding 30 miles to the journey, hindering the shipping on the Grand Canal. The current ship lock, then, is to open another diversion canal east of the three locks to take a straighter course, passing through in just over one kilometer. During the visit, we were hosted by Engineer Yin Chengzhi. The plan, in addition to the upstream and downstream lock gates having a water flow limit of 9 meters, is the same as the Shaobo lock. After this lock is completed, the old lock will be closed but not blocked, for use in flood discharge during major floods. The next morning (the 5th), we went to Huaicheng to meet with local figures to discuss issues of providing relief and conscripting labor. In the afternoon, the project office invited the county magistrates of the eight counties of Si, Huai, Lian, Huai, Bao, Gao, Tai, and Jiang, and the twelve section chiefs to a joint meeting. At the end of the meeting, Han and Ma were again invited to the table for talks, and a vote was taken on more than 30 proposals concerning conscripting labor, transportation, food, management, and sanitation. In the evening, Huaiyin County Magistrate Qi Yunlong hosted a dinner at the People's Education Hall. Messrs. Han and Ma delivered speeches during the dinner, and the evening ended on a joyous note. We returned south on the 6th and arrived in Zhenjiang on the 7th (the 8th).</p>

<p>As the winter season approaches, the First District of this county is proceeding with winter defense in accordance with past practice. On the 7th, it convened the township and town chiefs under its jurisdiction, and also sent a letter requesting that Section Chief Yu Shifang of the Public Security Bureau attend. Presided over by District Chief Li Zufu, it was resolved to name the office the First District Winter Defense Branch Office. The district public office is designated as the general office, and the urban and suburban areas are organized according to police districts in accordance with past practice. Yu Kuisun, Wang Yunshi, Sun Shaochi, Che Yiru, Huang Runhan, Du Lianhua, Du Yayan, Wu Juchi, Zhu Jiuwang, Xu Chunbo, and Jiang Jingcheng of Huayang District were appointed as the chief and deputy directors. It was decided that the plan would be implemented starting on the 16th of this month. Each district will recruit its own patrolmen and raise its own funds. However, the hat badges will be issued and used by the general office. The items have been reported to the county government for record.</p>

<p>Shengzi Temple in Punan is under the jurisdiction of the Seventh District and is the boundary between Songjiang and Fengxian. However, nine-tenths of the town market belong to Songjiang territory, and only one-tenth belong to Fengxian territory. Therefore, the Second Public Security Bureau of this county dispatched a patrol leader to set up a lookout post there. Recently, however, a platoon leader from the Third Company of the Thirteenth Security Brigade dispatched by Fengxian led three patrolmen to set up an inspection station, specializing in inspecting ships. A Songting gasoline ship passed by a few days ago, and the platoon leader ordered it to stop for inspection. The ship argued that the waters were turbulent and the boat was unable to stop immediately. Moreover, the pier belonged to Songjiang territory, but the platoon would not allow it to dock. Thereupon, they fired a shot into the air, causing panic among the townspeople. As a result, the people of the town reported to the District Chief of the Seventh District and the Second Public Security Bureau, requesting that they be stopped. After reporting to the county government, it was instructed to handle the matter to maintain the safety of travelers and the stability of the commercial market.</p>

<p>In the villages and townships of Xietang, Luxiang, and Jiaozhi in the Suzhou countryside, riots have broken out again due to the reporting of false wastelands. Dozens of homes of tax collectors have been burned down. After the security team captured the ringleaders Chen Qiutao and six others, the county reported to the province for instructions. An order was received instructing them to be escorted to the province for investigation. County Magistrate Wu, upon receiving the order, dispatched a platoon of security team members to escort Chen Qiutao and the six others to Zhenjiang yesterday and send them to the garrison command for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Details of the Tragedy in Likou Township <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The report yesterday covered the case of the robbery and theft at the home of You Caifa in Youjiabang, Likou Township, where the 63-year-old woman You Gu was hacked to death by the thieves. It is now known that You Caifa worked in Shanghai pulling a night soil cart. Only his wife Yao and his elderly mother Gu lived in the house. The night before, You Yao, due to physical fatigue, went to sleep early. Her aunt You Gu was still working at night. Around midnight, You Yao felt someone removing her earrings while she was asleep. She woke up in shock and saw her aunt You Gu lying in a pool of blood in front of the bed. She felt for her pulse, but she was already breathless. She also saw a hole in the wall, but no thieves. You Yao immediately cried for help, and neighbors rushed over upon hearing the sound. They helped in the pursuit, but the thieves had disappeared. Upon inspection, it was found that about one hundred silver dollars and gold jewelry were missing. The local headman reported to the local prosecutor's office, which sent personnel to examine the scene yesterday (the 8th). The examination confirmed that You Gu died from three knife wounds. The office ordered that a coffin be prepared for burial and notified the Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate the criminals and bring them to justice.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Green Poison Pill Manufacturing Den Cracked <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Tang Baotong, a native of Changshu, was originally a medicine merchant specializing in the production of pills and powders. Seeing that selling poison pills was very profitable, he prepared a set of poison pill manufacturing machines and rented a house at No. 54 Taiping Lane in this county to privately produce green poison pills for sale in the Changshu area. Around 8:00 PM the night before last, the Inspection Department of the Public Security Bureau received a tip-off. They immediately dispatched police to the address, arrested the suspect Tang, and seized 500 green poison pills and a machine. Tang's daughter, Guiying, was also taken to the bureau and sent to the county for interrogation. Moreover, the county government received an order from the province yesterday, stating that the smuggling of private soil and highly toxic substances often involved collusion with railway employees who provided protection and used the railway for private transport. The order instructed them to strictly prevent such activities to facilitate the enforcement of prohibition policies.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Major Fire at the Hengqin Factory in Nanwai <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Hengqin Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Fangjia Alley, Banqiao, Nanwai, was established by Xu Shoukang and Xing Mingqiu, natives of Xieyuan, with a capital of 40,000 yuan. It has been in operation for three years and is large in scale, with more than 60 power looms and its own engine generator. It has a wholesale office in Shanghai. Xing Mingqiu recently went to Shanghai to quit opium. The factory duties are being handled by Shou Kang's son, Sanbao. The factory's cloth sales are very good, and night shifts started last month. Yesterday (the 7th) around 5:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out in the bobbin room of the factory. According to reports, the cause was a cigarette butt being dropped in a pile of yarn. Fearing losses, they did not announce it at the time, but ordered the factory workers to put out the fire themselves. By the time the flames broke through the roof, outsiders learned of it. Around 6:00 PM, the fire department was finally notified, and fire trucks rushed to the scene. The fire had already spread to the yarn accounting room and cloth room. Only the weaving room and outside accounting room were unaffected. At the same time, the houses of neighbors Xing Shuntai, Xing Sengui, Xing Shenzhi, Xing Shengzhen, Xing Shouqi, and tenants Zhu Jintang, Su Yangzhi, and Tan Abing, which were connected to the factory buildings, were also affected. A total of twenty-eight rooms were burned down. Together with the yarn, cloth, and equipment in the factory, the total loss was estimated at seventy to eighty thousand yuan. Fortunately, Hengqin had fire insurance. Xing Mingqiu in Shanghai has been telegraphed to return to Cheng to handle the matter. Work was temporarily suspended on the 8th. Work will resume after the fire scene has been cleared.</p>

<p>Xu Baoguang, the director of the Wu County Public Security Bureau, recently received a tip-off that Fu Xiaogou and other accomplices of the fugitive bandit Ren Haoming were running a gambling den in Yangtianba in the Fifth District, and that the profits were being used to campaign for Ren Haoming's release. He requested that police be dispatched to arrest them. Director Xu dispatched Inspector Xu Shengting and Service Officer Cui Yulin, leading a team of more than thirty police officers. On the afternoon of the 6th, they took a car to Qishuyan, transferred to a boat, and landed at Hengshan Bridge. They walked to their destination, arriving around 3:00 AM on the 7th. They waited until dawn. When the teahouse clerk opened the door, they ordered him to lead the way. They then apprehended Fu Xiaogou. However, the gambling den had already closed down upon hearing the news. Inspector Xu and others took Fu Xiaogou back to the bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>At Huaiyin Private Cheng Zhi Vocational School, the third-year students, because they will be graduating next year, and the Department of Education has still not approved their registration, which will affect their chances of further education, suddenly launched a storm at 3:00 PM on the 5th. All the day students and some of the faculty and staff in the school climbed over the courtyard walls and fled. The troublemaking students then blockaded the school gates, preventing other students and faculty and staff from entering or leaving. Principal Zhang Shaonan, fearing that the storm would escalate, personally went to the county government and the Public Security Bureau to request assistance in maintaining order. Section Chief Fang and Inspector Chen went to the school to dissuade them. The students finally agreed to leave the school on the afternoon of the 6th. Principal Zhang and others then entered the school to inspect the damage, and found that many school properties had been damaged. Zhang, considering that it was difficult to resume classes at present, gave the students from distant places travel expenses and ordered them to return home. He would notify them to return to school for classes once everything had been tidied up. The storm came to an end.</p>

<p>Lu Dagou, the secretary of the Anti-Opium Committee of Jiangdu County, led armed police and assisted Ling Xixian, an official dispatched by the Provincial Committee, in searching for opium offenders. They first discovered eight small packages of opium and many opium paraphernalia in the underground cellar of Sun Yanwu's house in Dayuan. At the home of Liu Chen and Bao Sun in Xiaoyangrou Lane, they seized nine opium boards and many opium paraphernalia. At the home of Cao Guobao in Dongyuanmen Lantern Lane, they seized many hiding places, three pieces of opium, and many opium paraphernalia. Because Cao escaped, his grandmother Cao Zhang was detained and interrogated. On the morning of the 7th, a written report was prepared and police were dispatched to accompany Commissioners Ling to escort Sun Yanwu, Liu Chen, Bao Sun, Cao Zhang, opium, and opium paraphernalia to the province for interrogation.</p>

<p>Li Xiaojin, a female student at the West Lake Art College in Hangzhou, was questioned by the Third Section of the Secretariat of the Provincial Government on suspicion of being a reactionary. She was ordered to be handed over for custody and supervision. Later, due to a case involving reactionary classmates, she was summoned by the Security Department and ordered to confess. Li then stated that on the day she was handed over for custody by the Third Section of the Secretariat of the Provincial Government, she had asked Long Jianxing, a clerk in the section, to ask a friend to explain the matter and had paid 130 yuan as a reward. Chairman Lu was furious upon hearing the news. He immediately ordered the guards to take Long into custody and personally issued an order for his dismissal. In addition to ordering Section Chief Cheng Ying to thoroughly investigate the matter, he ordered that the people, documents, and evidence be transferred to the High Court for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<p>Case of a letter from the Changyuan County Government: Received a telegram from Director Kong Jian of the Labor Relief Group of the National Government Yellow River Flood Relief Committee: "I have just read in Shen Bao, reporting that the Ji Provincial Government received a telegram from the Changyuan County Magistrate stating that the water flow at the breach in Longmenkou is turbulent, the water outside the city is one zhang higher than inside the city, and loopholes are being discovered in the city walls daily. The water is very large, and the entire city is in danger of being submerged. I checked the recent reports, the water level in Guantai has been declining daily. How could the water outside the county city still be one zhang higher than inside the city? Is what is reported true? Please investigate and reply by telegram." The above telegram was dispatched, and there is no such fact in this city either. I think it is an error in the reports of your newspaper. I am writing to request that you investigate and correct it, so as not to confuse listeners and cause misunderstandings. County Magistrate Zhang Qinglu.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Venue Arrangement <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>In front of the Inqishi Memorial Hall, a white cloth banner reading "Meeting of 'Shen Bao' Staff to Commemorate Mr. Shi Liangcai" was hung. A simple colored archway was erected at the entrance, and the character "Dian" [meaning offering/tribute] made of neon lights was installed at the entrance. This was a gift from the Daylai Neon Light Company of the Baiye Trading Company. The General Manager Huang Weichang and Chen Qiwei personally came to direct the installation, and their kindness was greatly appreciated. The meeting place was on the second floor. The altar in the main hall was made purely of pine and cypress branches, adorned with fresh flowers and blue electric lights in a semi-circular shape. The aisle was covered with blue and white silk, strewn with fresh flowers and leaves. In the center was a full-body three-dimensional portrait of Mr. Shi, surrounded by white silk, with the four characters "Ren Lun Shi Biao" [meaning a model of morality and virtue] inscribed on it. A white cloth banner reading "Spirit Immortal" hung in front of the altar. Each pillar in the hall was wrapped with pine, cypress, and bamboo branches. Over two hundred elegiac couplets and memorial banners written by colleagues were hung on the four walls upstairs and downstairs. The arrangement was simple and solemn, and the entire venue was quiet, naturally inspiring feelings of sorrow.</p>

The career that Mr. Shi devoted his life's energy to is in public opinion. Naturally, there are many people who mourn upon hearing this news. However, we, the colleagues serving at the 'Shen Bao,' which Mr. Shi devoted his energy to, are with Mr. Shi day and night, and listened to his instructions daily, so we feel especially sorrowful and saddened.

<h3 id="e119">Reading the Biography <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Qian Hua read "The Life of Mr. Shi Liangcai," compiled by the funeral committee, saying: Mr. Shi Liangcai, named Jiuxiu, was known by his style name in middle age. His ancestral home was Jiangning. His father, Chunfan, suffered from the Taiping Rebellion and did business in Xisijing Town, Shanghai, and thus settled there. Mr. Shi was intelligent from a young age and studied under the respected scholar Dai Kuiren, reading books and remembering them after one glance. Xisijing belonged to Lou County, Songjiang Prefecture. In the spring of the 25th year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty), he was admitted to the Lou County school as a Supplementary Student. At that time, it was after the Wuxu Reform (Hundred Days' Reform). Mr. Shi was indignant at the corruption of the Qing Dynasty's politics and abandoned the path of imperial examination. Together with Lei Jixing and Gong Jingqing from Songcheng, he studied Japanese language and applied sciences such as physics and chemistry. In the autumn of the 27th year of the Guangxu reign, he and his fellow villager Wu Fengci were admitted to the Hangzhou Sericulture School. During a school break, he advocated for the establishment of schools and urged local elders to raise funds, which led to the establishment of the Yangzheng Primary School for the rice industry in Sijing, which is still thriving today. After Mr. Shi completed his studies at the Sericulture School, he was hired as a teacher of physics and chemistry at the Wang's Yucai School in Shanghai. He then held teaching positions at the Binggong School, Wuben Girls' School, and Nanyang Middle School. At that time, the imperial examination system had not yet been abolished. Mr. Shi was skilled in rhetoric and once gave a lecture at Yangzheng Primary School to enlighten the people, and the audience flocked to listen, all admiring his foresight. In the 30th year of the Guangxu reign, he founded the Women's Sericulture School in Guishu Lane, Gaochang Temple, Shanghai, which was the first women's sericulture education in our country. In the past thirty years, the prosperity of the sericulture industry in the counties around Taihu Lake has been greatly influenced by Mr. Shi. This school was later moved to Hushu Pass in Suzhou, which is now the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture School. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign, together with other comrades, he initiated the Jiangsu Educational Affairs General Association. Not long after, the proposal for Jiangsu and Zhejiang to borrow British funds to build roads arose. With the advocacy of Tang Dianxian, Zhang Jian, Wang Dankui and other elders, the public gathered funds to build the roads themselves. Mr. Shi was one of the most active in this endeavor. After the company was established, he was elected as a director. At that time, Mr. Shi also served as the chief writer for the Shibao newspaper and had already developed a deep interest in the news industry. In his spare time, he initiated the National Agricultural Affairs Federation in Nanjing and was elected as the general manager. When Nanjing held the Nanyang Industrial Exposition, Mr. Shi gathered agricultural experts to participate in the examination and research. Soon after, the revolutionary army in Wuhan launched an uprising, and the provinces responded. The leaders in Jiangsu were Cheng Xuelou, Zhang Jian, Ying Jizhong and other gentlemen. Mr. Shi participated in all consultations. However, at that time, talents gathered, and Mr. Shi was particularly praised for his keen thinking and precise governance. Therefore, the Jianghai Customs property was as tangled as a ball of thread, and the Shanghai Customs Clearance Office was established, with Mr. Shi in charge. The salt administration in Songjiang needed to be reorganized, and the Songjiang Salt Bureau was established, with Mr. Shi as its head. Mr. Shi focused on social undertakings, believing that the rise of a country was based on culture, and that promoting culture required the media as the vanguard. Therefore, in the first year of the Republic of China (1912), he took over the Shen Bao newspaper, which was struggling. For more than twenty years, he never slackened, truly pouring his life's blood into it. When Yuan Shikai stole the country and offered a large sum of money to order him not to oppose the imperial system, Mr. Shi refused directly. Subsequently, the warlords ruled the country for ten years. He remained upright and clean, and careful and self-preserving, which took a lot of effort. Mr. Shi also believed that enterprise creation was the foundation of a wealthy and prosperous country. In the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), he co-founded the Zhongnan Bank with the overseas Chinese businessman Huang Yizhu. In the same year, he initiated the Minsheng Cotton Mill. He also assisted Xiang Songmao in expanding the business of the Wuzhou Pharmacy, and assisted Lufei Bohong in reviving the Zhonghua Book Company. Everything he planned prospered. People therefore admired Mr. Shi's talents and courage. Mr. Shi focused on stability and further expanded the newspaper business. In his spare time, he visited both Daoist and Buddhist temples, consulted classics, and practiced meditation. After more than ten years of dedicated cultivation, he gained considerable peace and tranquility. He also learned boxing and fighting skills, and his agility was unmatched, even surpassing that of young people. After the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), Mr. Shi was greatly indignant and gathered comrades day and night to discuss how to assist the government in saving the country. After the January 28th Incident (Shanghai Incident) broke out, the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association was organized, and he was elected as its chairman. After the association was reorganized and renamed the Shanghai Municipal Local Association, he was still elected as its chairman. The government especially valued Mr. Shi. The Rural Reconstruction Committee hired him as a member, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was reorganized into a state-owned enterprise and he was hired as a director, and the Ministry of Industry planned to establish the Wenxi Paper Mill and hired him as the deputy director of the preparatory committee. The Shanghai Municipal Government established a temporary Municipal Council and hired him as a councilor, and he was elected as the speaker. Mr. Shi deeply felt the mutual respect from both the government and the public, which motivated him to work harder. He never declined any position in economic, cultural, and charitable organizations. For example, he was elected as a director of the New China Cultural Association and as a standing director of the Zhongshan Cultural Education Center. His constant concern was for the Northeast, and he founded the Northeast Refugee Relief Association with his comrades, hoping to alleviate the suffering of the refugees. His participation in other public welfare undertakings cannot be fully described. Since he studied physics and chemistry at an early age, he would support any scientific inventions, even with heavy financial assistance. As for the Shen Bao, which he independently managed, after holding the 60th anniversary celebration, he was determined to expand the affiliated businesses, such as the continuing education school, circulating library, yearbook, and monthly magazine. He also hired experts to produce detailed national maps, all of which made great contributions to enlightening people and culture. He worked tirelessly day and night, exhausting his mental and physical strength, and often suffered from stomach ailments. He took the time to go to West Lake in Hangzhou to rest and recuperate. Unexpectedly, on his way back to Shanghai from Hangzhou, near Wengjiabu Dazhakou in Haining, he encountered many bandits and was assassinated. This happened at 3:00 pm on November 13th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). He was only fifty-six years old.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Reading the Memorial Oration <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The entire staff of the Shen Bao newspaper offered a memorial oration to Mr. Shi, saying: On December 8th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), we respectfully offer pure wine and delicacies to the spirit of Mr. Shi Liangcai, saying: Ah, our Mr. Shi, the hope of the nation, with broad capabilities and extensive knowledge, truly a gift from heaven. Intelligent and exceptional from a young age, praised and admired by all in the neighborhood. Outstanding among peers, talents and heroes vied to recommend him, seeing him as a man of great potential, capable of shouldering great responsibilities. Dedicated to public welfare, he firmly established his will, and amidst the clamor of worldly pursuits, he did not let it cloud his nature. Gifted in writing from a young age, he was able to adapt to change. With great foresight, his eyes were like torches. Lamenting the ignorance of the times, and the downward flow of society, he corrected wrongs and guided goodness, on which the people relied. With the publication of each paper, the masses were inspired. The continuation and expansion of glory was mainly due to Mr. Shi. Establishing the norms and principles, he illuminated the path. His heart and soul nurtured and cultivated, resulting in the flourishing of the newspaper. With a voice to speak out, he strived to enlighten the people, cultivate talent, and promote education, benefiting all. His good reputation was widely spread, and both the public and private sectors sought his advice. He listened to the opinions of the people, and made suggestions to the government. Mr. Shi was never complacent. With remaining energy, he thought of doing more, relieving disasters and helping the needy, opening up granaries. All his great achievements are clearly visible. His love and kindness were bestowed on the people, and no one should dare to insult him. How could such a virtuous man be envied by the wicked? Poisonous hands and old grudges plotted secretly, attacking from all sides. A sudden storm arose, and he met with such a tragic end. The dying words of Lord Mengchang [a famous historical figure] echo through the ages. With Mr. Shi's age and strength, there was still much to be done. To be cut down so early, what can we say? We are unworthy, but honored to know him and cherish our old friendship. Hearing the news of his death, we were caught unprepared, unable to save him. We express our sorrow with our words, feeble as they may be. We offer this memorial, hoping his spirit will acknowledge it. Alas! May you enjoy this offering. After reading, the entire assembly stood and bowed three times. Then, speeches were given by colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Summary of Speeches <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>First, Mr. Guo Butao of the Xinwen Bao newspaper, a former colleague of this newspaper, gave a speech, saying in brief, Mr. Liangcai died an unnatural death, and everyone, whether acquainted or not, mourns with one voice. Mr. Shi dedicated his life's work to the benefit of society. His sudden misfortune is a great loss to Chinese society. But since things have come to this, instead of passive sorrow, we should actively strive to continue Mr. Shi's unfinished will. In my opinion, "sacrifice" has two interpretations: one is a meaningful sacrifice, and the other is a meaningless sacrifice. Mr. Shi's death is a meaningful sacrifice. Nothing in this world can succeed without sacrifice. Without sacrifice, there is no hope of success. For example, to make a table, we must first sacrifice trees, sacrifice labor, and sacrifice paint before it can be made. Everything we need in our daily lives, such as food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, inevitably sacrifices various substances. Extending this to all the contributions of mankind worldwide, has there ever been a moment without sacrificing the infinite energy of the sages and philosophers to develop today's civilization? The annals of history, both Chinese and foreign, can serve as evidence. For example, Jesus sacrificed himself on the cross, and his great spirit of universal love can move all mankind. The compassionate essence of Buddhism has been passed down for thousands of years and has not waned to this day. Confucius is a model for all generations and was also the person with the greatest spirit of sacrifice in his time. He did not avoid any hardship, and his doctrines are admired both in China and abroad. It can be seen that the two words "sacrifice" have always been the same throughout history. Mr. Liangcai was a famous figure of his time and a pioneer in the newspaper industry. Unfortunately, he sacrificed his life. Although his body is dead, his spirit shines brightly both in China and abroad and will never die. How should we continue his legacy and carry forward his work? Those of you here cannot shirk this responsibility. Therefore, I say that the meaning of commemoration is not in form but in the efforts of the spirit. May you continue Mr. Shi's legacy and strive forward so as not to betray the original intention of commemoration.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Ma Yinliang, manager of this newspaper, said in a brief speech: Mr. Shi loved the colleagues of this newspaper the most. Now that Mr. Shi has unfortunately passed away, I hope that all colleagues will love the Shen Bao with the same heart that Mr. Shi loved us. Then, even though Mr. Shi is dead, his spirit will not die. What I hope for even more from my colleagues is that we not only maintain the Shen Bao but also do our best to make it progress and develop. Then, Mr. Shi's spirit will not only not die, but it will also have a day to flourish and be carried forward.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Qu Shaoyi of the editorial department of this newspaper said in a brief speech: Mr. Shi's death is recognized as a great loss to society. There are indeed not many people today who are engaged in social undertakings with the same enthusiasm and perseverance as Mr. Shi. Mr. Shi did not reach the age of longevity and could have continued to serve society. Now, due to an extraordinary change, society has lost a mentor, which is truly regrettable. Therefore, those who mourn Mr. Shi are not only the colleagues of the entire newspaper but also the people of society, who deeply express their grief and regret. Mr. Shi has left us. Those who survive should rise up and strive to maintain his career forever without decay. The success of a social undertaking is difficult for the creator, and it is also difficult for the maintainer. Mr. Shi was the creator, and we are the maintainers. In the future, if there are people who will take over the responsibility for the social undertaking, then the achievements of the creator will never be extinguished through the ages. The colleagues of this newspaper have always held the purpose of assisting Mr. Shi's career. Although Mr. Shi has passed away, his spirit will remain forever in the world, and his career will last forever in society. If we can all work together, it will be enough to repay Mr. Shi.</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Zhang Zisheng, Director of the Shen Bao Yearbook Society, spoke of his personal admiration for Mr. Shi's daily cultivation and practice, saying: Mr. Shi often studied Buddhist scriptures in his spare time, and his cultivation was deeply influenced by Buddhism. Therefore, he could understand the true meaning of the word "diligence" in Buddhism, so he could strive to be proactive, abandon the interests of the "small self," and consider the welfare of society, and strive to run various undertakings. Because he was deeply helped by the four words "see one's mind and realize one's nature" in Buddhism, he could see things clearly, and could make decisions on all matters with one word. Now that Mr. Shi has passed away, his cultivation and practice can serve as a model for his colleagues to emulate. I hope that colleagues will carry forward the Shen Bao's business with the spirit of "diligence" and observe all related issues with the effort of "seeing one's mind and realizing one's nature."</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Yu Zhonghua, Director of the Shen Bao Monthly Magazine Society, said briefly: On this day when the colleagues of this newspaper are commemorating Mr. Shi, each and every one of us feels heartbroken and grieved. Although I and the colleagues of the Monthly Magazine Society have only been in the newspaper for more than two years, our qualifications in the newspaper are very shallow, but we are very heartbroken for Mr. Shi's tragic assassination. So I know that the colleagues who are old-timers in the newspaper must be even more grieved. I have thousands of words to say about Mr. Shi's unfortunate death, but in sorrow, I feel that there is nothing to say, so I will now only report to you a conversation that Mr. Shi had this summer. "A friend, Mr. Ma Xingye, majored in journalism in the United States. He graduated and returned to China this summer. When he arrived in Shanghai, he wanted Mr. Ma Yinliang and me to introduce him to Mr. Shi and Mr. Zhang to talk. We first introduced him to Mr. Zhang, and then Mr. Ma Yinliang and I introduced him to the Shi's residence to talk. When Mr. Shi saw him, he told him about his experience in running a newspaper. Mr. Shi said that the newspaper is like a large glass jar that is easy to break. I have been holding the historical Shen Bao for more than 20 years, and I have finally managed not to break it. Now I have held it until I am covered in sweat. I am old, and in the future, this Shen Bao will be held by many old colleagues in the newspaper. He also said that Mr. Zhang has been the same for decades, and Mr. Ma Yinliang has also been actively fighting for the newspaper. Running a newspaper requires perseverance, and Mr. Zhang's decades of consistency are truly admirable." Who would have thought that only a few months later, the words were still in our ears, and unfortunately Mr. Shi has passed away and can no longer hold the Shen Bao, and this Shen Bao really has to rely on the old colleagues in the newspaper to hold it up. When you hear my brief report, you will definitely be even more saddened, but I believe that after you are saddened, all of you, all the old-timers, will also feel the great responsibility, because in the past, the Shen Bao was held by Mr. Shi like holding a glass jar. Now, the Shen Bao has to be held jointly by all of you colleagues, especially the old-timers. Mr. Shi had many businesses during his lifetime, but the business that he put his heart and soul into was the Shen Bao. I believe that the human body sometimes comes to an end, but the spirit is immortal forever. The body can be destroyed by assassination, but the spirit cannot be eliminated by bullets, because the body can be destroyed, but the spirit cannot be eliminated, so the spirit is immortal forever. Therefore, I believe that if you want to commemorate Mr. Shi, you must maintain the Shen Bao well, and to carry forward Mr. Shi's immortal spirit, you must also maintain the Shen Bao well. If you old-timers can take on the responsibility of maintaining the Shen Bao, it is the best way to commemorate Mr. Shi and the most powerful proof that Mr. Shi's spirit is immortal.</p>
<p>(6) Mr. Zhou Shoujuan, editor of the Shen Bao Chunqiu supplement, said briefly: Mr. Shi suddenly died in an accident on the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Road on the afternoon of November 13th. I learned of the bad news that evening at a friend's house. At first, I thought it was inaccurate, and when I arrived at the newspaper, the news had been confirmed. I was inexplicably grieved. The West has always considered "thirteen" an ominous word, but the Chinese do not always believe it. Now that Mr. Shi has unfortunately died on the 13th, he is considered a pessimist. Those who view life and death as not being important, but at this time when the national crisis is serious, we should be inspired to find a way to break the national crisis. I personally feel that the gunshots on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road are just like the gunshots in Zhabei during the "January 28th" incident. The gunshots in Zhabei damaged China's vitality and destroyed our cultural undertakings, and the gunshots on the Hangzhou-Shanghai Road killed the authority of our newspaper industry. The meaning and tragedy are equally significant, making me remember it forever and never forget it. Mr. Shi was harmed, but he can be said to have sacrificed himself for the Shen Bao. Now that Mr. Shi is gone, we should follow the bloodstains of the martyrs and work hard to comfort the spirit of the hero, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Colleagues' Oath <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>At the end, Mr. Xu Deliang, a colleague of this newspaper, made a temporary proposal: (1) Send a telegram to the Executive Yuan of the National Government and the Military Affairs Commission, requesting them to quickly arrest the murderers and solve the case; (2) The colleagues took an oath in front of the spirit to express their unified attitude. The oath reads: "We swear with sincerity to continue the legacy of General Manager Shi, to fight actively, this oath."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Telegram Requesting Arrest of Murderers <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>To President Wang and Chairman Jiang of Nanjing: Mr. Shi Liangcai, the General Manager of this newspaper, was murdered. We are grateful for your clear orders to arrest the murderers, but nearly a month has passed and they have not yet been caught. Today, all employees held a meeting to commemorate and unanimously decided to send a telegram requesting you to strictly order your subordinates to intensify the investigation to clear the injustice and uphold the law. We are overwhelmed with anticipation. Zhang Yunhe, Ma Yinliang, and 491 others from the Shen Bao Newspaper respectfully kowtow.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Family Members' Response <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Mr. Shi Jiangguang gave a response on behalf of Mr. Shi's family, saying: "My uncle unfortunately passed away. Thank you to all the colleagues for holding this memorial meeting. We are grateful in life and death. My uncle dedicated his life to the newspaper industry, and half his life to the serious business of the Shen Bao. I hope that in the future, you colleagues will continue to love my uncle and love and carry forward the Shen Bao. Then, my uncle's spirit in the afterlife will surely smile in the nine springs. Thank you all for your kindness." He bowed three times and withdrew. The entire assembly was photographed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Xu Hanting of the Zhangshu branch of the Shen Bao in Jiangxi wrote: Respectful greetings to Mr. Yonggeng of the Shen Bao Newspaper: I was shocked and deeply saddened to hear of the misfortune of your father. I send this telegram to express my condolences. Xu Hanting of the Zhangshu Town Shen Bao branch kowtows, November 29th.</p>

<p>There are five types: 10 cents, 20 cents, 40 cents, 1 yuan, and 2 yuan. Ten-cent and twenty-cent tickets are the most common. However, people from all walks of life, recognizing that the boy scouts spare no effort, sacrifice time and studies, and plead for the more than five million disaster victims in various provinces, are all generous in their donations. However, the donation collection time was originally scheduled to stop at 4:00 PM. Since yesterday was Saturday, all cinemas, dance halls, restaurants, and hotels were extremely prosperous in the evening. Therefore, most of the boy scouts delayed their return to the group until after 11:00 PM. Therefore, it is difficult to implement the settlement today. The Boy Scout Council has now decided to clear the settlement before Monday and submit it to the Shanghai General Relief and Disaster Relief Committee in various disaster areas. However, according to Secretary Luo of the Municipal Council, the Nanjing Road area had the best results in this fundraising. The city-wide street donation results are estimated to be over 10,000 yuan. While fundraising, the boy scouts accidentally lost a donation book with two-cent tickets, number A 392. The company will send someone to the YMCA Boy Scout Office to report it.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Xiao Zhenying Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss the Process of Representing Chiang Kai-shek in Mongolia for Comforting and Appeasement <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Transmitting the Central Government's Intentions to Jointly Consolidate the Border Areas</p>
<p>The Current Situation in Chahar Province is Peaceful and Finances Can Still Be Maintained</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province and Representative of the Peiping Readjustment Committee, Xiao Zhenying, recently represented Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and accompanied De Wang from Sui to Mongolia to inspect the recent situation in Inner Mongolia and convey the Central Government's intentions in order to jointly consolidate and unite the border areas. He has already completed his work, went south from Ping, and went to Beijing to report to Chiang Kai-shek on the inspection process. After completing his official duties in Beijing, he specially came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. He received the reporters of the Shen Shi News Agency at the hotel and talked about the mission to Inner Mongolia and the current situation of the military and political affairs of Mongolia and Chahar. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Comforting and Appeasing Mongolia to Consolidate the Border Areas <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>According to Xiao, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek wanted to understand the real situation of political affairs in various parts of the country and inspect the northwest border areas in order to establish a practical link between the central government and the border areas. Therefore, when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Suiyuan, he intended to go to Mongolia to thoroughly understand the current situation in Inner Mongolia. Mongolia is an important barrier for our country and is of great importance. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek paid great attention to this. However, due to time constraints, he could not go in person. At that time, De Wang and others had heard the news and went to Sui to pay their respects and had detailed discussions on Mongolian political affairs. In the past, no important government officials had personally inspected the Inner Mongolia border area. The result of this meeting between Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and De Wang completely eliminated the isolation between the central government and Inner Mongolia. Chiang Kai-shek also gave sincere instructions on the future policy of Mongolian affairs. Afterwards, in order to express the central government's concern for Mongolian political affairs, Chiang Kai-shek specially ordered me to accompany De Wang to Mongolia to convey the central government's intentions and discuss unity methods with the leaders of various banners to consolidate the border areas.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Impression of Inspecting Inner Mongolia is Very Good <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>This time I went to Mongolia and have discussed the future of Mongolian political affairs and the implementation of policies with the leaders of various banners. I have also conveyed the central government's intentions for Mongolian affairs and how to seek organizational unity methods. De Wang and others have expressed their willingness to cooperate sincerely with the central government. After the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Committee, it has achieved considerable results. As for the entire method of Mongolian political affairs, it still needs to be continued. According to my inspection this time, the current situation in Inner Mongolia is that the area is as vast as an boundless ocean. It is not easy for foreigners to occupy it. The people of Mongolia are mostly nomadic, scattered and not concentrated. All urban construction, etc., also lack a central point of assembly. Therefore, it is difficult to easily control it in military and political affairs. In the past, our country did not pay close attention to it, which led to the coveting of others and the use of various enticing methods to try to win over the Mongolian people and manipulate everything, such as the Japanese setting up "Neighborly Cooperation Cooperatives" everywhere in Inner Mongolia to sell cheap goods to the Mongolian people on credit, and setting up hospitals and distributing medicines in order to change the mentality of the Mongolian people. This is indeed a serious danger, but most of the Mongolian people have no good feelings towards the Japanese. As for our country in the past, although there was a lack of close contact, they still have a good concept of us. Therefore, it is now urgent for our government and people to pay attention to it and promote their unity, and then seek closer cooperation with our country.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Recent Situation in Chahar Province <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Xiao continued, the current situation in Chahar Province is still without special changes. In the Chahar-Rehe border area, the Japanese and puppet troops often appear and provoke our army. It is difficult to determine whether they have copied the old habits and attempts of the four eastern provinces, but after our calm response, there is no other danger. As for Chairman Song, he has always adhered to a consistent proposition, protecting the territory and securing the people, and being cautious in handling affairs, so he can maintain the current peaceful situation within Chahar Province. Currently, Chahar Province has four divisions and two mixed brigades. The military expenses are all allocated by the Peiping Military Branch. The financial situation in Chahar Province is that the income is not abundant due to the barren area, but it can still be maintained with savings and response.</p>
<h3 id="e141">This Trip is to Report to Chiang Kai-shek on the Mission <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Finally, according to Xiao's statement to the Shen Shi News Agency reporters, the mission of this trip south is purely to go to Beijing to report to Chiang Kai-shek on the process of the trip to Mongolia. He has already reported the details in Beijing and the work has been completed. Therefore, he took the opportunity to come to Shanghai to visit old friends. There are no other tasks. He plans to take the night express train back to Beijing tonight and leave Beijing for the north after the Fifth Plenary Session.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Jiande Bank Suspends Business for Five Days <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Jiande Bank on Be河南路 Tianhougong Bridge in this port has been doing well since its establishment. Recently, due to internal problems, it had to announce the suspension of business. It posted a notice at the entrance of the gate yesterday morning, which reads: "The bank is undergoing internal reorganization and will be temporarily closed for five days. It is now planned to continue normal business on the 13th of this month. Special announcement. Jiande Bank."</p>
<h3 id="e143">Items Sealed <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>When the Central News Agency reporter heard this news, he drove to the Jiande Bank at Tianhougong Bridge and saw that the two entrances and exits were tightly closed, and there were many people watching in front of the door. The reporter entered from the side door. The items in the bank have been sealed. The manager of the bank, Chai Chuangui, and other important staff members,</p>
<p>Did not arrive at the bank, and several junior staff members were guarding the bank.</p>
<h3 id="e144">No Impact <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that the bank attaches great importance to the operation of savings deposits, so it has absorbed a lot of savings deposits from depositors. Since the bank announced its closure, the general depositors have gone to the bank to inquire about the facts, but because the important staff of the bank are not present, they have not been able to get the main points. According to the banking sector, the bank's capital is 500,000 yuan, which is not a large scale. There are no large sums of money in the banking sector, so the closure has no impact on the banking sector.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Pirate Riding Incident on the Zhejiang Sea, Shibu Ocean, on the Xinhai Gate Wheel <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Passengers and Goods Were Looted</p>
<p>One Navigation Police Officer Was Killed</p>
<p>Six Crew Members and Passengers Were Kidnapped</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that the headquarters of the Haimen Shipping Company is located in Ningbo. The Xinhai Gate Wheel has a deadweight of more than 400 tons and specializes in sailing between Ningbo and Wenzhou. On the 6th of this month, it was fully loaded with passengers and goods and departed from Ningbo. By 2:00 AM on the 7th, when passing through Shibu, more than 20 pirates disguised themselves as passengers and sneaked in. At that time, it was not discovered. After leaving Shibu, at about 2:00 PM, the pirates who had sneaked in fired a shot as a signal and began to ride and loot.</p>
<p>Navigation Police Killed. The Xinhai Gate Wheel was not equipped with anti-theft equipment and only sent four escort police officers to protect the ship. When the pirates were riding and looting, they first monitored the shipowner and the escort police officers. The navigation police resisted and one was killed by the pirates. The rest surrendered their weapons. Three or four passengers and teahouse staff were injured by stray bullets. More than 100 passengers were looted. About 300 pieces of goods in the ship, such as cotton yarn, cloth, and groceries, were also looted.</p>
<p>Before leaving, the ship sailed to Niushenmen Yangmian Gate and forced it to stop. They loaded the looted property into the pirate ship prepared in advance. Before leaving, they also kidnapped the comprador Zhang Akun and six passengers. The ship sailed as usual and arrived at Haimen on the evening of the 7th, and immediately telegraphed the Ningbo headquarters to report the looting. It is reported that the company has telegraphed the military police on various shores to strictly arrest the pirates and rescue the kidnapped people.</p>

<p>Absconded After Receiving the Deposit</p>
<p>Plaintiff Demands Compensation of 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Beijing Opera House of the Samsung Stage on Niuzhuang Road in the British Concession was originally established by Zhou Bingchen, Zhao Ruquan, and the late Huang Chu Jiu. At the beginning of the cooperation, a Samsung Real Estate Company was also organized. All the houses adjacent to the theater were the property of the company. Later, after Huang Chu Jiu passed away, Zhao Ruquan and Zhou did not agree and went to court last winter. As a result of the lawsuit, Zhao's shares were also merged into Zhou's, so from this year on, all the Samsung Company and the Samsung Stage belonged to Zhou alone. However, Zhou's financial resources have never been very strong, and the theater's business has become increasingly declining. The shape of the exhausted state has become increasingly exposed recently. Zhou has no power to support it, and began in September to sell the theater and all the adjacent houses to Pang Laichen, a wealthy merchant from Nanxun in Shanghai. The price was agreed at 270,000 yuan, and Pang first gave a</p>
<p>Deposit of 100,000 yuan, and the remaining 170,000 yuan was collected by Mann, a British staff member of the Water Company, entrusted by Zhou. Before the sale, Zhou had mortgaged the real estate to Mann. However, Zhou also worked at the Water Company in the past, and had a close friendship with Mann, and they often communicated and helped each other in times of need. In the mortgage of Samsung's real estate to Mann, a part of the money was Zhou's private property. Zhou entrusted Mann to collect the 170,000 yuan of land price, and wanted to exchange the real estate certificate with him, hand it over to the buyer, and settle the accounts between them. Unexpectedly, after the settlement, the amount of money that Zhou wanted to find was more than 50,000 yuan more than what Mann found. Zhou was unwilling to sacrifice a huge amount of money, so he wrote to the buyer Pang Laichen, stating that he would revoke the power to entrust Mann to collect the money, and requested that the 170,000 yuan still be paid to him for collection. However, Pang believed that this entrustment and collection procedure was a condition agreed upon by the three parties, and</p>
<p>There was a contract that was still wet with ink, and he suddenly went back on his word, lost faith in foreigners, which was definitely not what he wanted. He strictly rejected Zhou's request, saying that he must follow the agreed terms. Zhou then filed a lawsuit against Pang for not paying the property price. The First Special District Local Court summoned the plaintiff, the defendant, and the important witness Mann to investigate. It was ruled that the agreed entrustment and collection contract should not be overturned, and the plaintiff lost the lawsuit. Zhou failed, and there was no hope for the property price at present, the economy was still in panic, and the debt was piled up, and he had to find another way out to raise funds. When he sold the real estate, he believed that the Samsung Stage was created by him, and did not want the stage to disappear with the property rights. After discussing and agreeing with Pang, he signed another lease contract and leased the stage to him for continued business. Now that he has lost the lawsuit,</p>
<p>There is no way to raise funds, so he had to ask Weng Xieyao and Zhu Shuzhu to mediate, and sell all the stage properties, scenery, and costumes of the theater to Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage, for Gu to continue performing at the original site. The price was set at 36,000 yuan, and Gu paid a deposit of 10,000 yuan on the 20th of last month, all of which were Jifeng Qianzhuang's bank notes, divided into one sheet of 5,000 yuan, one sheet of 3,000 yuan, and two sheets of 1,000 yuan, with the payment date set on the 30th of last month. Zhou noted in the receipt issued for receiving the deposit that he would sign a formal sales contract within three days. After three days, Zhou suddenly absconded, neither signing the contract nor returning the bank notes. Although Gu repeatedly urged the two intermediaries to negotiate with Zhou, he could not find him and could not find any clues. Gu hired a lawyer to write to Jifeng, asking not to pay the money for the bank notes. Later, the bank replied that the nature of the bank notes was not like checks, and if he insisted on stopping the payment, he needed a court order to stop the payment. Therefore, Gu filed a</p>
<p>Criminal lawsuit against Zhou for fraudulently obtaining property in the First Special District Local Court, and said that when negotiating the sale, they had agreed with each other that no matter which party regretted it, they should be punished twice as much as the deposit. Therefore, in addition to asking the defendant to be punished in accordance with Article 363 of the Criminal Law, the defendant should be ordered to compensate the loss of 20,000 yuan, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened a court hearing. The defendant Zhou Bingchen did not attend, and only the plaintiff's lawyer and the two witnesses, Weng and Zhu, attended the court. They briefly described the situation of Zhou entrusting them to discuss the sale of the theater property with Gu, and said that the Samsung Stage has stopped business yesterday, and Zhou Bingchen has disappeared, requesting that a warrant be issued for his arrest, etc. Judge Huang then ordered that the hearing be postponed to the afternoon of December 15. The plaintiff should surrender himself to the court for questioning on the due date.</p>

<p>The Woman Subsidizes Medical Expenses of 1,500 Yuan</p>
<p>The Eight-Year-Old Daughter Is Raised by the Plaintiff Until Adulthood</p>
<p>Liu Mingzhu, the daughter of Liu Huizhi, the president of the China Industrial Bank, was previously married to Duan Ao from Jiangxi and had a daughter named Tianbao, who is eight years old. Because Duan suffers from mental illness, Liu previously filed a lawsuit for divorce with the Second Special District Local Court, which was rejected. Now, her mother, Zhu, in her capacity as a legal representative, has hired lawyer Zhou Shaoqin to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special Court for divorce from Liu, requesting that Liu pay medical expenses of 3,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi opened a court hearing. Liu Mingzhu hired lawyers Dan Yuhua, Chen Zhongyin, and Lu Shaozong to represent her. At that time, because both parties had already reached a settlement outside, the numbers and the point of who would raise the daughter were not resolved, so under the persuasion of the court, it was decided that both parties would be granted a divorce, and the woman would subsidize the plaintiff's medical expenses of 1,500 yuan, and the eight-year-old girl would be raised by the woman until adulthood, and the case was concluded.</p>

<p>Letter to the Farmers Bank</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai wrote to the Farmers Bank yesterday regarding the revival of the Weiting felt project, saying, "To the point, according to a letter from our member, Lu Shengsun, the owner of Lu Shengji Company, our company has been in Shanghai for decades, operating felt, adhering to the old methods, and lacking the skills to expand. We have now read the news that the Farmers Bank has taken action to revive Weiting felt, which is very gratifying. At a time when domestic products are declining, it is fortunate to have a powerful person to assist in promoting them. Please bother to write to the bank to inquire about the revival plan, so that we can follow it," etc. Upon arrival at the association, we should send a letter to you and hope to check and reply.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Calculation Method for Names in Foreign Telegrams <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Full Spelling Counts as One Word</p>
<p>Abbreviations Calculated Separately</p>
<p>Effective from the 10th</p>
<p>Regarding the calculation of fees for commonly used abbreviations and combined words in foreign telegrams, the Ministry of Transportation previously did not provide illustrative examples, leading to numerous confusions and disputes when various sectors sent such telegrams at telegraph offices. A special order is now issued to all telegraph offices, stipulating that connected words within such telegrams should be charged per word unless proven to be a registered telegraphic address. This applies whether the words are used in the address, message, or signature. For example, "Georgesmitb" should be counted as two words, "Hgwells" as three words, etc. Furthermore, for Chinese names translated into English, full spellings such as "Wangpaosung" are specially permitted to be counted as one word. However, abbreviated names such as "Pswang," whether in the telegraph address, message, or signature, should be counted as three words to comply with the provisions of the International Telegraph Convention's auxiliary telegraph regulations. It is also reported that the local telegraph office has received orders and distributed them to all receiving and sending clerks, to be uniformly implemented starting from the 10th of this month.</p>

<p>The Chapei Charity Group recently discussed preparations for winter relief congee distribution. Due to the economic depression and unrecovered vitality in the Chapei area, many factories have not contributed, resulting in a large number of unemployed poor. Coupled with the drought since the summer and the influx of famine refugees from various places to Shanghai, scattered in Chapei, many have come begging for food. On one hand, the second congee factory on Liuying Road is being urgently instructed to have craftsmen construct and repair the building, stove, and reed sheds as soon as possible to prevent freezing and provide timely relief. Director Wang Binyan, seeing the daily increase in the number of poor, urgently seeks funding. Besides requesting the municipal government for financial assistance, personnel have been dispatched to report to various directors and solicit the continued support of the Federation of Charity Groups, the Chinese Health Society, the Moral Society, the Xinwei Relief Society, the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, and various philanthropists, as before. The number of poor in this session is greater than before, otherwise, financial difficulties are feared.</p>

<p>The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its 53rd luncheon discussion meeting at noon yesterday in the east hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge. More than thirty people attended, including Li Zhaohuan, Lu Meiseng, Cao Yunxiang, Wu Yun Chu, Fang Zhicheng, Li Shouzhong, and Tang Zeyan. During the meeting, Tang Zeyan, secretary of the Industrial and Commercial Management Association, presided over the event, and Lu Meiseng, professor at Great China University, gave a speech on "Advertising and Sales Problems." The speech briefly stated that advertising already existed in the Greek era five thousand years ago, but it was not until 1911 that scientific methods were used to publish advertisements. The United States spends ten billion US dollars annually on advertising, which China cannot compare to. However, the purpose of advertising is to achieve broad effects. Therefore, advertising studies encompass psychology, literature, fine arts, economics, and commerce, and it is by no means something everyone can do. The current shortcomings of advertising in China are: (1) lack of system, (2) lack of order, (3) lack of planning, (4) lack of purpose, so advertising is mostly wasteful. Although schools have gradually introduced this course, it has not yet received sufficient attention.</p>

<h3 id="e161">New Life Collective Marriage Measures <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Advocated by the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Appreciates</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs advocated the New Life collective marriage, all sectors have paid close attention, recognizing it as a necessary measure to shift extravagant customs and maintain the people's economy. It is learned that the Bureau of Social Affairs has submitted a draft plan to the Municipal Government for review. Mayor Wu also expressed his appreciation. The situation obtained from the Bureau of Social Affairs is as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Initiation According to a spokesperson for the Bureau of Social Affairs, the bureau has always paid great attention to the improvement of marriage ceremonies in the city. Recently, it has been noted that customs are becoming increasingly extravagant, and the cost of marriage often amounts to thousands. Although citizens have a strong desire for frugal marriages, they ultimately dare not set an example for fear of being despised by relatives and friends. Now is the time to actively promote the New Life Movement, and it is necessary for the government to promote frugal marriages to make them easier to popularize among the people. The use of collective marriage is to make the married person understand that he/she is a member of society, and to extend the concept of family to the concept of society. The previous report stated that the New Life collective marriage would follow the Italian method, which is not true, because Italy is limited to party members, while the city has no such restrictions, and the nature is completely different. Once this method is approved by the Municipal Government, registration will begin. After the city's trial implementation, it is hoped that provinces and cities will follow up to shift extravagance.</p>
<p>Draft Measures The draft measures are divided into three parts. The first part is the application for registration, which is divided into eight articles: (1) Citizens of the city who hold a wedding ceremony may apply to participate in the collective wedding ceremony. (2) The collective wedding ceremony is scheduled to be held in the City Hall Auditorium on New Year's Day, the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, Confucius' birthday, and National Day, and will be officiated by the mayor and the director of the Bureau of Social Affairs. (3) Participants should pay a fee of 20 yuan per person. (4) Participants should first apply to the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval. The application form can be obtained from the Bureau of Social Affairs in person and is free of charge. If the quota is full or there are doubts about the applicant, the application may be rejected. (5) Applicants who are approved for registration will be issued a registration certificate by the Bureau of Social Affairs and will participate with the registration certificate on the due date. (7) Applicants should strictly abide by the "Instructions for Participating in the New Life Collective Marriage" and comply with all times and procedures. (8) Marriage certificates will be prepared and issued by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Newly Established Ceremony The wedding ceremony has also been slightly changed, such as the officiant taking his seat, (4) the master of ceremonies leading the married persons to take their seats in turn (the seating arrangement in the auditorium stipulates that the officiant is in the center front, the last row on the left is the relatives, the female host and related persons are in the middle row, all married women are in the front row, the guests are in the last row on the left, the male and female hosts and related persons are in the middle row, all married men are in the front row, (5) performing the collective wedding ceremony, the married persons stand opposite each other to perform the wedding ceremony, (6) the married persons issue marriage certificates, the male and female hosts lead the male and female married persons in turn to receive them, and then return to their original positions (7) the officiant delivers a speech, (8) the ceremony is completed, the male and female married persons each leave with their arms crossed, the banquet after the wedding is: (1) After the wedding ceremony, the officiant invites all married persons to a banquet for celebration, and to wish for the beginning of a new life, (2) the married persons should take their seats according to the arranged seats, (3) After the banquet, the collective wedding ceremony is completed.</p>

<p>Several patrol boats of the Jianghai Customs were equipped with spark-type radio transceivers. They have recently been retrofitted with new machines, and the old machines have been dismantled. Therefore, the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office transferred these machines to the China Radio Engineering School on Avenue Edward VII in Shanghai.

<h3 id="e164">Emergency Relief Universal Donation Movement Enthusiastically Supported by Industrial and Commercial Circles <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>General Labor Union and Municipal Chamber of Commerce Both Issue Notices</p>
<p>Since the start of the emergency relief universal donation movement in the city, the work has been quite intense in recent days. Tomorrow is "Workers' Donation" Day. In addition to submitting a request to the municipal government to order the employers of all factories to deduct one day's wages for relief, and notifying all labor unions to instruct all workers to comply, in accordance with the resolution of the Temporary Representative Conference, the Municipal General Labor Union has also issued a letter to all workers in the city, excerpted below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Workers Dear workers of the city, in the past two years, industry and commerce in the city have been declining, the market has been depressed, and factories have been closing down and reducing work hours. Unemployed workers are increasing, and the lives of workers in the city are extremely difficult. The reason for this is the impact of the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, but the unrest caused by the communists in the interior, the lack of livelihood, the bankruptcy of rural areas, and the reduction of purchasing power, resulting in the stagnation of cargo transportation and the sluggish sales, are the biggest reasons. This year, various provinces have suffered from severe drought, affecting eleven provinces and tens of millions of victims. The cries of distress spread everywhere, and refugees are fleeing, making the situation even more difficult to describe. Under such circumstances of communist disasters, droughts, and floods, the compatriots in the disaster areas are already on the verge of death, and the productive and purchasing power have been lost. As a result, the industry and commerce of the city are becoming increasingly weak. Mayor Wu Tiecheng has initiated a major emergency relief universal donation movement to revive the disaster victims and stabilize the disaster areas. He has convened meetings with various agencies and important groups in the city to discuss the establishment of a donation committee for emergency relief to various disaster areas to actively carry out the work. At the same time, the General Labor Union also convened a meeting of representatives of various labor unions on the 5th to decide that all workers in the city should donate one day's wages, and piece-rate workers should donate 50 cents per person, to collect our blood and sweat to assist the government and various sectors of the city in completing this urgent disaster relief work. Dear workers, we have always been reluctant to lag behind in saving the country and other public welfare undertakings. Of course, we will not sit idly by in this major emergency relief universal donation movement. We must know that although our current lives are painful, it is nothing compared to the disaster-stricken compatriots who have no clothes or food. Therefore, it is our duty to donate one day's wages to help them. Furthermore, the compatriots in the disaster areas will stabilize their lives due to emergency relief and will be able to restore their productive power and purchasing power. Then, the industry and commerce of the city can return to prosperity, and our lives can also get a considerable turnaround. Therefore, this kind of emergency relief movement, although it is said to be saving people, can also be said to be saving ourselves. I hope that my dear workers will uphold the spirit of seeing justice and acting bravely and enthusiastically contribute.</p>
<p>Notice to Union Members The Municipal General Labor Union yesterday notified various labor unions in a document stating, for the purpose of notification, this year's severe drought has caused disasters everywhere, with crop failures, affecting eleven provinces and tens of millions of victims. The cries of distress spread everywhere, and refugees are fleeing, either digging up grass roots to satisfy their hunger or peeling bark to fill their stomachs. The scene is tragic and unbearable to witness. The compatriots in Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Anhui have suffered the ravages of the Red bandits, and wealthy families have become poor people, and the extremely poor households have turned into starving people. The severity of the disaster is even more difficult to describe. As the severe cold is approaching, the disaster victims have no clothes or food. If they are not rescued quickly, they will fill the gullies. Therefore, Mayor Wu Tiecheng of the city has initiated a major emergency relief universal donation movement and has established the "Shanghai Emergency Relief Universal Donation Committee for Disaster Areas" to actively carry out the work. Comrades in the labor sector are brave in doing good and have never lagged behind. For this righteous act, how can we sit idly by? The union convened a temporary representative meeting of various labor unions on the 5th and decided that all workers in the city should donate one day's wages, and piece-rate workers should donate 50 cents per person for relief, and set the 10th as the Workers' Donation Day. In addition to requesting the municipal government to order the employers of all factories to deduct the wages and remit them to the Shanghai Bank, this notice is to inform the union to immediately inform all workers to comply, to be happy to support, and to jointly promote this righteous act.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a public notice yesterday for soliciting emergency relief for disaster areas in various provinces, and notified various industry associations to convene meetings to deliberate on fundraising. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Public Notice to the Business Community The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is issuing a public notice to the business community on the matter of requesting the business community to raise funds to help disaster areas in various provinces, stating that the Municipal Emergency Relief Universal Donation Committee for Disaster Areas has sent a letter stating that the disaster situation in various provinces this year is extremely severe and has requested to consult with various industries on the method of emergency relief universal donation. As the severe winter is approaching, disaster victims in various provinces lack clothing and food. Fundraising for emergency relief is urgently needed. In addition, this year's disaster area is vast and unique. It is necessary to gather all strengths and efforts to ensure more comprehensive protection. Although the Shanghai market is in a state of commercial depression, it is a safe area. It is requested that all sectors of the city's business community enthusiastically donate to the best of their ability. This is of utmost importance. In addition to notifying various industries separately, it is feared that there will be omissions. Therefore, it is hereby republished in the newspaper for public notice.</p>
<p>Notice to Various Industries Received a letter from the Municipal Emergency Relief Universal Donation Committee for Disaster Areas stating that this year's water and drought disasters have spread to various provinces, the disaster area is vast, the disaster situation is severe, and there are few such cases. The Shanghai market is in a time of commercial depression, but those who are hungry and drowning are all compatriots who cannot control themselves. If they can each do their part, accumulate small amounts to make a large amount, it will be beneficial to the overall situation of relief. It should be the responsibility of each public association to convene a meeting of the same industry to deliberate on the situation and raise funds for universal donation, and inform the handling situation to be able to reply. The matter has been discussed and decided at the 22nd Standing Committee meeting. Correspondingly, a letter is sent to notify you to immediately comply and see the reply.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Small Port Steamer Company Opposes Joint Road-Water Transportation <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Tonghua's Maiden Voyage Today</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has newly opened a joint transportation route connecting Lianyungang and Qingdao, scheduled to commence today with the dispatch of the Tonghua vessel on its maiden voyage. Unexpectedly, this has ignited a wave of opposition from all shipping merchants and customs brokers of the small ports, who have telegraphed to the Ministries of Communications and Railways, requesting a halt. However, both the road and water transportation parties believe that the joint operation will not hinder the business of commercial steamers and are proceeding as planned. Detailed information is as follows:</p>
<p>The Tonghua's voyage to Lianyungang, Laoyao, and Qingdao has traditionally been serviced by over twenty vessels dispatched by the small port steamer companies in that area. These vessels travel from Dapu to Qingdao, passing through ports such as Shijiusuo, Shidao, Lidiao, Chenjia Village, Wangjiatan, Zhucun, Lanshantou, Zhewan, Xiangshui River Mouth, and Qingkou. Their business encompasses both cargo and passenger transport. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's joint operation involves a direct route from Laoyao to Qingdao, bypassing the small ports, thus reaching the destination in only ten hours. The Tonghua vessel has been designated to exclusively operate this line, commencing its maiden voyage from Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Original Steamers for Small Ports: On this route, there are, including Changji's Changchun, Yingchun, Dechun, Tongchun; Fulohang's Yuantai, Hengtai, Litai, Shixiang; Yihua's Tongxing, Yongxiang, Yuchang Second; Yingji's Xinshun; Shandong Shangyun's Qinghai; Litong's Hengtong, Haitong; Yitong, Yiyuangong's Liji, Liyi; Nakamura Group's Qingxing, Maosheng, totaling twenty-four vessels. Even more sailboats are engaged in cargo transport. Ordinarily, their business heavily relies on freight from the Longhai Railway.</p>
<p>United Opposition: Customs brokers in the Dapu area, who rely on small port steamer transportation for cargo, including Dechangtai, Yongfeng, Changlong, Huifeng, Heyi, Changren, Huaji, and forty-one others, have already voiced their opposition when ships called at Laoyao. With the opening of the Lianyungang-Qingdao route, the small port steamer companies, united with the customs brokers, are collectively resisting, having petitioned the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways to stop it, in order to maintain the small port shipping business and prevent thousands from becoming unemployed.</p>
<p>Road and Water Transportation Disregard: The Longhai Railway's preparations for the opening of the new Lianyungang-Qingdao route are reportedly complete. Construction at the Laoyao wharf is finished, allowing for the berthing of one more vessel. Starting from December, an additional 130 railway police officers will be assigned to handle the loading and unloading of cargo for this route. They have resolved to ignore the opposition from the small port steamer customs brokers, arguing that the routes are different, with one serving Dapu and the other sailing to Laoyao. Furthermore, the Tonghua vessel will not call at the various ports, minimizing conflict. However, to protect the business of the small port steamers, the road and water transportation parties have adopted a non-competitive approach, setting the freight rate at three yuan per ton, maintaining the same price level.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Overseas Chinese Organizations Petition the Fifth Plenary Session for Relief <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Research Association, recognizing the urgency of the crisis facing overseas Chinese, yesterday telegraphed the Fifth Plenary Session, earnestly requesting effective measures to relieve overseas Chinese. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To Chairman Lin Zichao of the Executive Yuan, President Wang Zhaoming of the Executive Yuan, Chen Shuren, Zhang Zhen, Dai Kui, Ding Chao, Huang Shaoxiong, Gu Weijun, and all Committee Members: Our fellow countrymen overseas, who once resided in various countries, numbered over twenty million. In recent years, due to extreme oppression by local governments, no fewer than several million have returned home in distress. The returned overseas Chinese face difficult livelihoods and increasing suffering. Compounded by the increasingly harsh regulations of the Dutch East Indies and fervent anti-Chinese sentiment in various countries, the situation is even more tragic. At this time of international tension, if the government does not implement concrete relief measures, overseas Chinese will inevitably disappear. As the Fifth Plenary Session convenes, we especially urge you to formulate concrete plans for the relief of overseas Chinese, submit them to the congress for resolution, and request the government to implement them as soon as possible, in order to uphold national dignity and comfort the feelings of overseas Chinese. The Overseas Chinese United Research Association bows in unison."</p>

<p>Declares in Court That He Will Not Accept the Sentence if Not Executed</p>
<p>Li Zhiming, a local resident of Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai, is only twenty-two years old. He studied at Jingye School in this city in his early years. After dropping out of school, he had no legitimate occupation and spent his days with a group of idle individuals. He became infected with bad habits. He sold his ancestral property one after another, spending the proceeds. According to Li, his cousin-in-law, Yao Minggao, had acted as an intermediary in the sale of soil from his land, secretly embezzling a portion of the money. Li was ignored when he confronted Yao. Filled with resentment, he gathered accomplices at night and broke into Yao's house, stabbing Yao's wife, Yao Lu, to death. Yao himself suffered more than a dozen knife wounds but fortunately was not killed. After the incident was discovered, Li Zhiming was arrested and sent to the Procuratorate of the District Court, where he confessed to the crime. He was prosecuted in the Criminal Court on charges of murder. Presiding Judge Sun Jikang conducted a public trial. As the case was clear, it was considered closed and awaiting sentencing, as previously reported. It is now learned that this case was publicly sentenced by Presiding Judge Sun Jikang in the Fifth Court yesterday morning. Li Zhiming was brought to the court and briefly questioned. The court sentenced the defendant to two sentences: one to fifteen years of imprisonment and the other to life imprisonment, to be executed as life imprisonment. After the sentence was pronounced, the judge asked: "If you do not accept the judgment, you can appeal according to the law." The defendant Li replied: "Why not execute me by shooting?" The judge said: "The crime you committed does not warrant execution by shooting." The defendant Li said: "If I am executed by shooting, I will accept the judgment. But I absolutely do not accept life imprisonment." The judge said: "You must submit your reasons within ten days and appeal according to the law." After the order was given, the defendant Li was returned to custody pending further instructions.</p>

This will take effect on the 10th of this month. Once the price of copper coins returns to normal, the old rates will be used for exchange.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 8th) The National Vocational Education Conference continued at the Ministry of Education at 9:00 AM on the 8th. In the morning, the conference divided into two groups for examination. One was the Vocational Education Funding Allocation Standards Examination Committee, and the other was the Vocational School Department Establishment and Graduate Employment Issues Examination Committee. The above two examination committees completed the examination of each case and submitted them to the general meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Second General Meeting in the Afternoon <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the second general meeting was held. The attendees were the same as yesterday. Gu Shusheng, chairman, reported the examination opinions on the standards for the allocation of vocational school funding, and the meeting then entered into discussion.</p>
<p>1.  Regarding how each province and city should realize the Ministry-designated standards for the establishment and funding allocation of secondary schools, the meeting resolved to adopt the original plan. The word "how" in items 1, 2, and 3 was deleted, and the following was added: 4. If any province or city has special difficulties and the Ministry of Education confirms that this is the case, the deadline for completing the standards may be extended, but only for one or two years. 5. When provinces and cities realize the Ministry-designated standards, the Ministry of Education will verify the extent to which they have been achieved or the special difficulties, and provide subsidies as appropriate. 6. The Ministry of Education is requested to suggest that the central government allocate 3 million to 5 million yuan annually from fiscal year 24 (1935) onwards for the purpose of subsidizing vocational education in the provinces and cities.</p>
<p>2.  Regarding how each province and city should, based on the industrial situation and the types of vocational talent needed in their province and city, reorganize the department establishment of existing vocational schools and determine the types of departments to be established in future vocational schools, the meeting resolved: 1. Each province and city should quickly establish a vocational education design committee, responsible for investigation, contact, and research. Its tasks are as follows: 1. Investigate the industrial situation, vocational types, and talent needs of each industry in the province or city. 2. Conduct a detailed investigation of the department establishment of existing public and private vocational schools in each province and city, to determine whether there are any shortcomings, whether they correspond to the needs, and whether employment is convenient for graduates from each department. Departments that do not correspond to the needs should be subject to reasonable control and reorganized into other departments. 3. Formulate specific plans for the addition of departments in future public and private vocational schools and implement them in stages. 4. Each province and city should formulate the following three standards for designing the promotion of vocational education: 1. Establish more vocational supplementary schools and junior vocational schools. 2. Senior vocational schools should focus on graduation. 3. Restrictions should be placed on the establishment of commercial vocations.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Upsets in the Sko-Ta Cup <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Lax eliminates West Point 1-0</p>
<p>Chinese Point also defeats West Commerce 1-0</p>
<p>Today, Yu You plays French Commerce at the Yiyuan</p>
<p>In the second week of the Sko-Ta Cup, Donghua first defeated Inness 5-0. Both games yesterday were upsets. (1) Lax defeated West Point 1-0. (2) Chinese Point also eliminated West Commerce 1-0, which was unexpected. Today, there is another game between Yu You and French Commerce, held at the Yiyuan. After this game, it will be the quarter-finals week. This year, the Chinese team has high hopes for the championship.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Chinese Point Actually Defeats Southwest Commerce <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The battle between Chinese Point and Southwest Commerce was held at the Yiyuan. The performance of both teams was mediocre and uninteresting. Southwest Commerce is getting worse and worse, and its military appearance is declining. It was actually defeated by Chinese Point 1-0, causing 2,000-3,000 spectators to cheer and rejoice beyond expectation. Chinese Point goalkeeper Yin Xingsheng was very lucky and saved countless dangerous balls, which was a great contribution to Chinese Point. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Point</p>
<p>Yin Xingsheng, Ma Bingzhang, Xue Zhiwen, Zhu Guiquan, Miao Huaguo, Zhang Ziquan, Wu Xiquan, Liao Zhonggan, Dong Zhaobin, Qiu Tiansheng, Yao Jiagui</p>
<p>Southwest</p>
<p>Lewis, McLaughlan, Faping, Beeches, Stokes, Haite, Leif, Los, McCaughan, Tal, Fasde, Columba, Larson</p>
<p>Southwest Commerce's Luck is Really Bad Isn't Southwest Commerce really not as good as Chinese Point? In short, it's just bad luck. From beginning to end, Chinese Point was in a position of being oppressed, and Southwest Commerce attacked frequently, but could not find its way in. In fact, Chinese Point was on the big stage for the first time, and everyone was full of energy and morale. They also focused on defense with all their strength, so that Southwest Commerce had no way to use its strength, and could only lament helplessly.</p>
<p>Yao Jiagui Opens the Record The first half passed peacefully, and neither side gained anything. About ten minutes after the start of the second half, Chinese Point suddenly broke free from its imprisoned state. Qiu Tiansheng sent a ball flying forward. Dong Zhaobin took advantage of the emptiness inside the opponent, and moved forward one step, passing the ball left and right. About twenty-five yards from the goal, he suddenly kicked the ball, with great force. The ball rebounded from the crossbar of the goal. The goalkeeper was shocked. Chinese Point's right winger Yao Jiagui had just rushed to the side of the goal and saw the ball kick it with one foot, and the ball flew into the goal. It bounced down from the crossbar and had passed the goal line. The goalkeeper hurriedly patted it with his hand, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Yin Xingsheng Protects the Country With Merit Chinese Point's victory was like a joy from the sky, and their morale was even more boosted. Wu Xiquan had two passes, and the landing points were excellent, but unfortunately the players in the middle did not respond properly and missed the opportunity. Southwest Commerce was unwilling to show weakness and launched a full counterattack, shooting furiously in succession. However, their luck was not good, either going out of bounds or hitting the crossbar. Moreover, goalkeeper Yin Xingsheng was blessed with inspiration and saved countless dangerous balls, earning thunderous applause. The country was preserved, and a victory song was sung, which was all thanks to this gentleman. After the game, he came out of the field and was surrounded by the audience and was very popular.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Lax Defeats West Point <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Another Sko-Ta Cup game was between Lax and West Point, which clashed at the Racecourse. Westerners watched, surrounded like a wall. West Point's strength has always been known as fierce. Lax was originally a fierce general, but before the game, it was generally speculated that West Point would not have difficulty winning. Unexpectedly, the result was the opposite. Lax eliminated West Point 1-0. This ball was scored by Bauselier in the first half. The competition between the two teams was fierce and the performance was quite good. The depression of Western teams in fact gives Yu You great hope in China.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Today, Yu You Fights French Commerce <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>There is still one game in the second week of the Sko-Ta Cup, which is between French Commerce and Yu You. They will meet at Yiyuan at 3 pm. In last week's United game, Yu You defeated French Commerce 5-3. Today, they meet again on a narrow road, and there will be an even more fierce competition. Moreover, after West Point lost to Lax and West Commerce lost to Chinese Point yesterday, the Chinese team has a great influence. I hope Yu You will work hard for it. If Yu You also loses to French Commerce, then in the future quarter-finals, the Western team will only have one Lax, and the Chinese team will occupy three. The championship will belong to the Chinese team.</p>

<p>At 3:00 PM at the Lizhi Society Stadium</p>
<p>To Play a Charity Game, Basketball Team Did Not Go</p>
<p>Yesterday, the First Division Team Won Against Shakor 4-2</p>
<p>This year, the drought in various provinces is extremely severe, and government officials are sparing no effort to raise money to provide disaster relief. Last time, Yu You was invited to Beijing to play a charity football game to raise funds. Now, the Donghua Football Team has also been invited to Beijing to play another charity game. The game is scheduled to be held at the Lizhi Society Stadium in the capital at 3:00 PM today. The Donghua team, with a total of sixteen players, also took the early express train to Beijing this morning and will arrive at 2:00 PM this afternoon. They will play as soon as they arrive. It is reported that Minister Kong has specially prepared a silver cup to commemorate the event. Wu Tiecheng, chairman of the Donghua Association and Mayor of the city, who happened to be in Beijing to participate in the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, also intends to take the opportunity of the game to give a speech to the players to encourage them. Members of the Association such as Song Ziliang, Zhou Shouliang, Sheng Pinchen, Hu Meian, and Ding Xuenong will all travel to Beijing together to support this grand event. The list of team members is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>List of Donghua Team Members Going to Beijing: Officer Xu Junhou, Feng Yunhe, Captain Lu Zhongen, Team Members Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, Feng Yunyou, Gu Shangxiang, Chen Hongguang, Dai Linjing, Li Yichen, Chen Jiaqiu, Wan Xianghua, Jia Youliang, Chen Gongyu, Xu Jingcheng, Fu Zhibin.</p>
<p>Basketball Team Did Not Go In addition to the football team, the Donghua Basketball Team was originally also on the list of invitees. Later, the Association politely declined the invitation of the basketball team due to various difficulties. According to a basketball player from the Association, the difficulties are as follows: (1) The game in Beijing must be played on the outdoor court of the Lizhi Society. The weather is already cold at this time, and the climate is not very suitable. (2) It is easy to get injured in outdoor games. (3) The game must be played during the day, because there are very few indoor basketball facilities in Beijing, and it must be designated to be held at the Lizhi Society. If it can be changed to be held indoors at night, the team would be very happy to go to Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Donghua Has Seven Wins in Seven Games <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Defeats Shakor Again 4-2</p>
<p>The Donghua Football Team played against Shakor in the Western Union First Division game at Shen Garden yesterday afternoon. Donghua won again with a score of 4-2 yesterday, creating a record of seven wins in seven games. Although Shakor is at the bottom of the Western Union First Division, it resisted stubbornly yesterday and was very unexpected. The starting lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Team</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen, Li Ning, Chen Gongyu, Xu Jingcheng, Gu Shangxiang, Chen Hongguang, Wan Xianghua, Li Yichen, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Shakor</p>
<p>Salaini, Kaixin, Meng Qing, Gudu, Zuo Safulote, Xialing, Luosilebosi, Fufu, Aga Pitofu, Kexing, Bausituofu, Ning Hailuofu</p>
<p>Three Consecutive Goals Donghua started attacking as soon as they came on the field, taking a big offensive position. Relying on the agility and skillful passing of its forwards, they scored three consecutive goals in the first fifteen minutes of the game, making Shakor stunned and unable to fight back. Chen Jiaqiu scored the first goal, followed by two goals from center A Dai.</p>
<p>Sudden Counterattack Donghua easily won three cities without much effort, and their morale was greatly boosted for a time, and the enemy was discolored. However, because the victory came too easily, the momentum of the attack slowed down. Shakor took advantage of this opportunity to launch a counterattack, and center Kexing scored twice in a row. In the first half, a tense situation of three to two was formed. Fortunately, the soldiers gave their lives in the second half, and Li Yichen shot again to break the goal, with Donghua winning 4-2.</p>

<p>Because Jiaotong University could not participate in the football match of this year's Jiangnan University Sports Association, Jinan and Fudan became the must-compete champions. Jinan's strength is not as good as before. Fudan is on the rise, winning every battle, and has great hope of winning the championship. Yesterday, the two schools met in Zhenru, and the nature was equal to the final, so both teams devoted themselves very much. As a result of the battle, Jinan won 1-0, so this year's championship has hope of winning again.</p>

<p>— Xuanzi</p>
<p>Every Monday morning, you all have the Commemoration Week, and after reading the Premier's Will, you follow it with "three minutes of silence." What exactly does this "silence" mean? Some of you children may not really know, and during the "silence," you might even be whispering. Some of you may even complain that the "silence" is too long, which is all wrong.</p>
<p>You read the Will and are required to "be silent" precisely so that you can remember the Premier in silence and think carefully about whether you have fulfilled every sentence in the Premier's Will. If you haven't, how should we, with a spirit of perseverance, continue the Premier's spirit to carry out the instructions he left us?</p>
<p>Only by doing so can we be true followers of the Premier, and this is something that all you children must remember.</p>

<p>Lincoln</p>
<p>Have you, friends, heard of Lincoln, the famous American president who liberated black slaves, prohibited slaveholding, and advocated humanitarianism? When he was a child, his family was very poor. They didn't have enough to eat, and they lived in a dilapidated wooden house built from planks. He naturally had no opportunity to study. He only attended primary school for six months. After he learned some characters, he studied hard on his own. He helped his father with work and studied at the same time. He didn't have money to buy books, so he borrowed them from friends he knew.</p>
<p>Once, he read a biography of Washington and learned about Washington's character. He suddenly slammed the book and shouted, "I will be like Washington in the future!" Those who heard him say this laughed at him and looked down on him because even the clothes he wore were very worn out. How could he ever become such a great figure?</p>
<p>But, children, do you believe it? The success of a great cause does not depend on having money, but on having a spirit of perseverance, a strong will, and also on having chivalrous behavior. Lincoln had all of these. One day, he saw a drunkard fall into a ditch. He helped him up and took him to a nearby house, asking the owner to let him sleep there. He personally took care of him until he woke up. At this time, he was only a twelve or thirteen-year-old child. Children, look at Lincoln's behavior in his childhood. How brave and righteous!</p>
<p>Honesty was also Lincoln's behavior when he was a child. When he was eighteen, he helped out as a clerk in a shop. In a hurry, he overcharged a customer four pence (a British currency). When he was balancing the accounts in the evening, he remembered it. He took the money to the customer's house. The road was long, and it was late at night, but Lincoln didn't care about that. He felt that integrity was more important than anything else!</p>
<p>Lincoln's spirit, will, and behavior in his childhood ultimately led to his great achievements when he grew up. Children, what are your thoughts after reading this story?</p>

<p>— A Duo</p>
<p>Children! Winter is here again! Although winter is cold, we should still pay attention to hygiene as usual.</p>
<p>There are many things that everyone doesn't do because they are afraid of the cold! So I'm here to remind you:</p>
<p>Do not close the windows at night to prevent poor air circulation.</p>
<p>Do not cover your head with the blanket when sleeping; sleeping with your head covered is unhygienic.</p>
<p>Be careful when walking if you are wearing too many clothes.</p>
<p>Don't take off your clothes immediately after exercising and getting hot, as you may catch a cold.</p>
<p>Winter games: Do not play with water, do not play with fire; playing with water will freeze your hands, playing with fire is dangerous.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Table Salt <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Children, have you studied chemistry? Children who have studied it will definitely say it's difficult, but chemistry is very interesting.</p>
<p>Children, do you know how table salt is made?</p>
<p>(1) Solar evaporation: In coastal areas, salt fields are set up on the coast. When the tide rises, seawater is directed into the salt fields. The power of the wind and the heat of the sun are used to evaporate the water. When the solution reaches the appropriate concentration, it is poured into a crystallization pond to crystallize into table salt.</p>
<p>(2) Boiling: Seawater is directed into salt fields, which are covered with fine sand. Because fine sand can absorb water, sunlight and wind are used to evaporate the water. After sunset, the sand is piled up. The next day, the sand is spread out again, and seawater is poured in, then dried and piled again. After several days of this, when the salt content in the sand reaches the appropriate concentration, the sand is placed in a cabinet-shaped filter, and seawater is poured in to dissolve the salt and filter it out, separating it from the mud and sand. This highly concentrated filtrate is placed in a pot and dried to obtain table salt.</p>
<p>If table salt is dissolved into a solution and electrolyzed, positive and negative electrodes are passed through it. As a result, a yellow-green gas is produced on one side, which is chlorine, a very poisonous gas. On the other side, a gray metallic solid is produced, which is sodium. If sodium is placed in water, it is very dangerous, and sodium cannot be held in the hand.</p>
<p>Children, I think you believe that chlorine and sodium are both very poisonous things. Wouldn't eating them be deadly?</p>
<p>Table salt is not poisonous at all because table salt is a compound of chlorine and sodium, so it is also called sodium chloride, and it has lost the original properties of chlorine and sodium.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Winter Knowledge <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Chuohengjiu</p>
<p>(1) When the weather is very cold, water containers such as vases and water bowls often crack because the water inside freezes into ice, increasing its volume. If we want to prevent this problem, just dissolve some table salt in the water, and this problem will not occur. Because the salt solution can lower the freezing point of the water, it will not freeze easily.</p>
<p>(2) In winter, many people often get frostbite on their hands or feet, which is really a painful thing, but we also have ways to treat it; just add some hydrochloric acid to hot water and wash it, and it will get better in a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Several Interesting Questions and Answers <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Yuntian</p>
<p>(1) Why do we feel hungry?</p>
<p>Answer: Our stomach is an organ composed entirely of muscles. The movement of this organ allows food to be digested. If our stomach has been empty for several hours, it will begin to undergo intermittent spasmodic contractions. At the same time as these contractions, we feel hunger. Therefore, the direct cause of hunger is the muscular contraction of the stomach.</p>
<p>(2) Why do we bend our bodies forward when going uphill? Why do we straighten our bodies when going downhill?</p>
<p>Answer: Our body's center of gravity is roughly at the waist. When going uphill, if we don't bend forward, our legs will move forward, and our center of gravity will lose its balance, and we will immediately fall back. The same principle applies to straightening the body when going downhill.</p>
<p>(3) Why does the weather get hot and cold?</p>
<p>Answer: Because the Earth rotates, sunlight strikes the Earth at an angle, and the heat is insufficient, so the weather gets cold in winter. If it strikes the Earth directly, it becomes hot. In addition, air convection can also cause changes in the climate.</p>
<p>(4) Why does touching iron feel colder than touching wood?</p>
<p>Answer: Iron conducts heat faster than wood. When you touch iron, the heat from your hand is transferred away more quickly, so it feels colder.</p>
<p>(5) Why can't we see things in a dark room?</p>
<p>Answer: All things that can enter a person's eyes rely on the reflection of light. There is no light in a dark room, so we can't see.</p>

<p>— Written by Ms. Qin Qianpei</p>

<h3 id="e222">Kicking Shuttlecock <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Now, many children are enthusiastically kicking shuttlecock, because kicking shuttlecock is originally a form of entertainment in autumn and winter!</p>
<p>Children have very few noble and beneficial forms of entertainment. Only kicking shuttlecock can not only serve as a game, but also strengthen the body, so now there are many people advocating the sport of kicking shuttlecock. The method of making a shuttlecock is like this: use a goose feather tube, cut it into an inch long, put it inside a copper coin with a hole, and then wrap the copper coin with cloth along one end of the goose feather tube and sew it well with thread. Then find a few colorful chicken feathers with white down from the tail of a rooster and insert them into the goose feather tube, and a shuttlecock is made?</p>
<p>The way to kick a shuttlecock is even more varied and ingenious, with each person coming up with their own tricks. There is front kicking; there is back kicking; there is alternating kicking with two feet; there are those who kick the shuttlecock to their faces; there are even those who kick it onto their backs; and there are also those who use their noses to catch it; those who know how to kick can not only kick out many styles, but also can kick hundreds, thousands of times, and never let it fall on the ground. However, those who are just starting to kick can often only kick it two times; at most, they can kick it eight or ten times. So kicking shuttlecock also requires daily practice. Only then can you gradually increase the number of kicks, because kicking shuttlecock is also an art!</p>
<p>Children! If you don't kick much; if you don't kick well; you must not be impatient. You must know that those who kick a lot; those who kick well; have also practiced hard. You only need to keep kicking every day, and naturally one day you will kick a lot; you will kick well!</p>
<h3 id="e223">Animal Hibernation <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>When we reach winter, because the temperature of the external air goes up and down, the temperature of the blood also rises and falls with the climate. Cold-blooded animals such as reptiles and amphibians spend the winter by lowering their blood temperature, but the term "cold-blooded animal" does not actually mean that they are all cold-blooded. For example, if the temperature suddenly drops in winter, animals living in cold places will not hibernate if they are moved to tropical places. In cold places, the blood of cold-blooded animals gradually decreases with the temperature, the activity of cells becomes sluggish, the digestive power decreases, and all functions decline, so they don't want to eat or move and crawl on the ground. Generally, these cold-blooded animals will hibernate at temperatures below sixty degrees. When the temperature rises above sixty degrees after winter, they will become active again and want to eat. The same is true for animals in the water as it is on land. They sink to the bottom of the water and rely entirely on the respiration of their skin to get through the winter. For example, turtles sink to the bottom of the water and stop breathing completely, but they have already ingested a lot of food before hibernation, so they don't need to eat. If you feed them food randomly at this time, even if they eat it, they won't digest it and will excrete it in April or May, so there is no need to feed them during the hibernation period, as for raising them in a greenhouse, that is different.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Fan Wenzheng Gong <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Shi</p>
<p>Children! Do you know the deeds of Fan Wenzheng Gong? He was a virtuous prime minister during the Northern Song Dynasty. "Wenzheng Gong" is his posthumous title. His name was "Zhongyan". When he was young, his family was very poor, but he was able to maintain a persevering ambition in a harsh environment, living in a Buddhist temple and studying diligently. As for food? He cooked porridge once and divided it into several meals. As for side dishes? He only ate some pickled vegetables.</p>
<p>Later, he passed the imperial examination and became a scholar, and he took the responsibility of the country to heart, and said: "I should be the first to worry about the world's troubles, and the last to enjoy the world's pleasures." When he was the prime minister of Emperor Renzong of Song, there was a Western Xia state that was very afraid of him and said: "Little Fan Laozi, has tens of thousands of soldiers in his belly." Therefore, they did not dare to invade China. He was able to govern the world very peacefully, which shows that he was a very responsible person.</p>
<p>In his later years, he also established a kind of righteous field, specializing in saving the poor widowers, widows, orphans and lonely people in the local area. Children! You should also learn to be like him!</p>
<h3 id="e225">The Diet of Animals Without Mouths <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Ri Zhao</p>
<p>Children, when you see this topic, you will definitely ask me strangely, how can animals without mouths eat? If you have studied natural science, I think you must know that the lowest animals are just one cell. That is the amoeba!</p>
<p>The amoeba is very much like candy, and it stretches very quickly, and it lives in water. It has no feet all over its body. When moving, a certain part of its body will naturally protrude; we usually call it "pseudopods". If the pseudopod is too short to move, it will stretch out another one.</p>
<p>When an amoeba wants to take food, it stretches out its only pseudopod and wraps around the two sides of the food, like we hold it in our hands to eat. At this time, the pseudopods gradually merge together, and the food is wrapped into the interior of its body. After the food is digested, it is excreted from its body to the outside. This is indeed a characteristic of lower animals.</p>
<p>Friends, if you want to see this strange animal, you must rely on the power of a microscope; the illustration on the left shows it eating food.</p>

<p>Empty Bottle Extinguishes Candle</p>
<p>Science Mr. is on stage again. In his hand, he is holding a glass bottle and a candle holder with a candle inserted in it.</p>
<p>He lit the candle and placed the glass bottle next to the candle holder. He asked the children below the stage, "Children, who can blow out this candle?"</p>
<p>Several small hands below the stage were raised at the same time, and they shouted in unison, "I can! ... I can ..."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Science Mr. said: "But I won't let you use your mouth to blow, that's not special. I want you to use this bottle to extinguish the candle."</p>
<p>This restriction stumped many of the children. Use a bottle to put out the fire? This is something no one can do.</p>
<p>But Science Mr. unhurriedly picked up the glass bottle, put it to his mouth, and blew air into it hard. After blowing for a while, he quickly pressed down on the mouth of the bottle and asked the children:</p>
<p>"Now you know what's inside this bottle?"</p>
<p>Some children said: "There is still nothing inside."</p>
<p>Some children said: "There is already a gust of air inside."</p>
<p>Science Mr. said: "There is already compressed air in this bottle. We release this compressed air, and we can blow out the candle." As he spoke, he pointed the mouth of the bottle at the candle flame, and when he released his hand, the candle went out.</p>
<p>"The power of this compressed air is very great. We can use machines to compress the air, make its volume smaller, and become compressed air. We seal this compressed air in an iron cylinder, and when it is released, its volume expands and can launch torpedoes.</p>
<p>"If I don't blow the air inside the bottle towards the mouth of the bottle and there is no compression, then no matter what, I won't be able to blow out the candle."</p>
<p>Testing tools - empty bottle, candle holder, and one candle each.</p>

<h3 id="e228">"Strange" Theories <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>We are now in a great age of idle talk. I have never seen the so-called "pure conversation" of the ancients; what people talk about now mostly revolves around women. They talk about movie stars, dance queens, school beauties, pretty faces, socialites, noble ladies... They talk and talk and still it's not enough, so they write about them. Currently floating on the sea (of public opinion) is a kind of appetizer to the conversation, something called the "Non-Marriage League"; everyone is spreading their claims, and there have been many famous articles, depicting it vividly, with great relish, it's just a pity that no one has been able to find out who the members are.</p>
<p>Today, if a knowledgeable woman makes a "non-marriage" proposition out of injustice over an adultery case, that would of course be strange; but to not think, not reflect, and to find strangeness in the strange, that is the strangeness of society! In recent days, several newspaper reporters have interviewed many famous women, and all have said they know nothing about this matter; how could such a grand league become so mysterious? I don't intend to protect women, insisting that this is all baseless talk; but even if it were true, what falls upon us in society is only the responsibility of guiding and correcting, not of exaggerating and mocking. Because they have, after all, suffered the greatest oppression for thousands of years, and a little childishness is not a heinous crime.</p>
<p>If it turns out this is just a rumor, that's even stranger; it's often said that "people of Chu love rumors." The people of Chu in the twenty years of civil war should have died enough, but now they can still spread all over the coast, how numerous are the people of Chu? Talking always becomes rumors, rumors always involve women, and rumors about women spread quickly everywhere, isn't that strange?</p>
<p>In recent years, supernatural novels and supernatural movies have become a prevalent malady in society. I remember Wang Yuyang's poem on *Liaozhai Zhiyi*: "Let us speak of it recklessly, let us listen recklessly, rain like silk under the bean trellis and melon frame, I suppose they dislike human speech, and love to hear ghosts singing poems from autumn graves." There are countless things that should be said in human speech! But people must only talk about the strange; the chaos and decline of society can be imagined. However, those who love themselves will not act against themselves, and will not follow the tide. If someone proposes a "non-marriage league," it is a dazzlingly strange theory; if it is someone's fabrication, and then widely promoted, then it is even stranger; in short, they are not people who cultivate themselves well.</p>
<p>Everywhere in society, people are talking about ghosts, about the mysterious, about gods, about women with "sexual" stimulation, marriage, adultery, always unprincipled talk; serious matters are left to iron hooves and cannons to resolve, to bloody brains to handle. Everyone is immersed in strange actions and strange theories, absurd and ridiculous, in nonexistent illusions; this strange nation can easily be branded as unnecessary. In fact, imperialists will also call us unnecessary!</p>
<h3 id="e229">Dedicated to Women's Movement Groups <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Zhenyi</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the reason why men and women cannot be truly equal is that the traditional ideas of patriarchal society have not been completely broken, and a truly equal system for men and women has not been established. Although this women's rights movement has not fundamentally solved the women's problems, it at least shows the enthusiasm of women's own struggle and resistance, especially at this time when women are being driven back to the home to be good wives and mothers.</p>
<p>The revision of Article 239 of the Criminal Law is only a superficial victory; in reality, we still need to unite the power of the masses and work together; for the general laboring women, we should give them great assistance with the spirit of the group. Therefore, requiring the formulation of a perfect labor law is also an important item in the women's rights movement.</p>
<p>The issue of female workers has already attracted the attention of most people, and the suffering of female workers has also aroused social sympathy. The government has formulated a new-style factory law based on the principles of protecting motherhood and equal pay for equal work, and it was clearly ordered to be promulgated and implemented in 1931, but regrettably, the factory owners requested an extension. Up to now, this law is nothing more than empty words on paper. Before a more perfect labor law is explicitly stipulated, the groups that bear the mission of the women's movement should continue to urge the government to force the factory owners to implement it effectively.</p>
<p>Now, the most important articles of the factory law concerning women are roughly appended below:</p>
<p>(1) Factories shall not employ men or women under the age of fourteen as workers...</p>
<p>(2) Male and female workers who are over fourteen but under sixteen years of age are child laborers, and child laborers only engage in light work.</p>
<p>(3) Child laborers and female workers shall not engage in handling explosive, flammable, or toxic substances, or other work that is harmful to public morals or dangerous.</p>
<p>(4) The actual working hours for adult workers shall be eight hours per day in principle. If it is necessary to extend the hours due to local conditions or the nature of the work, it may be set at ten hours.</p>
<p>(5) Child laborers shall not work more than eight hours per day.</p>
<p>(6) Child laborers shall not work between 7:00 PM and 6:00 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>(7) Female workers shall not work between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>(8) Workers shall have a half-hour rest period after working continuously for five hours.</p>
<p>(9) Workers shall have one day of rest in every seven days.</p>
<p>(10) Equal pay shall be given for equal work of the same effect for both men and women.</p>
<p>(11) Female workers shall stop working for eight weeks before and after childbirth, and their wages shall be paid as usual.</p>
<p>(12) If a female worker stops working in accordance with the provisions of Article 37 of the Factory Law, a doctor's diagnosis certificate shall be obtained at the request of the factory.</p>
<p>(13) The work assignment of child laborers, female workers, and workers over the age of fifty shall be determined after a health examination.</p>
<p>(14) Factories employing female workers shall, to the extent possible, set up nurseries and employ nurses to take good care of them.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Thoughts on Visiting the "Ping Le" Women's Detention Center <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>It was on an afternoon in early June, when the broad climate changed from slightly warm to extremely hot, that I visited the women's prison of the Ping Le Detention Center -- this women's prison is connected to the men's prison within the same courtyard. Not far from the entrance gate, there is a very large wooden fence, and in front of the ticket-selling-like desk outside the fence gate, sits a male prison staff member. On the desk, like a rockery, is a high pile of keys. On the side of the desk, there is a small uncovered box, filled with broken copper and scrap iron. According to the warden, Ms. Suo Zhang, who was acting as the guide, that is the foot shackles and handcuffs that the prisoners wear at night. Not far after entering the first fence gate is the second fence gate. At this time, the female prison staff member inside the fence gate, upon the introduction of Ms. Suo Zhang, immediately smiled and picked up her treasured possession -- a large string of keys of all sizes, and came to greet us. While we exchanged greetings, our feet had already stepped onto the passageway that separates the men's and women's prison cells. After walking only a few steps here, I glimpsed four or five children outside the third fence gate ahead. It is said that those were four or five of the seven children trafficked from Guilin by two human traffickers who had been causing a stir in the neighborhood for several days, so we moved our steps towards the unlocked third fence gate. Outside this third fence gate, there is a desolate open space like a courtyard, and mosquitoes were singing beside the two or three puddles of sewage on the ground. Against the wall on the left is a small, dilapidated house with only the roof remaining. Inside the house, in front of a temporary stove made of three bricks on the ground, a woman in her thirties was stir-frying rice. According to the explanation of the female prison staff member standing next to her, this open space is the children's playground, and this temporary stove is where the female prisoners cook their own meals.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the female prisoner had finished stir-frying the rice, and the female prison staff member wanted to send her back to the prison cell, so our group, large and small, all turned back inside the third fence gate, and walked about four or five feet to the right along the passageway, and arrived at the women's prison cell. Here, outside the door is also a row of very large wooden fences, and a five- or six-inch long padlock is placed across the fence gate. Between the wooden fence and the low bungalow that serves as the women's prison cell, there is still a piece of open space two or three feet wide. Seven or eight female prisoners were crowded in this open space, some standing, and two or three of them were making shoe soles, and one was knotting hemp. Inside the dark bungalow, there were more than ten female prisoners sitting there in a daze, each worrying about their own sorrows, and there were also two or three who were quietly making shoes. Among these twenty-odd female prisoners, except for the one standing by the prison cell door in a daze, who was only twenty-one or two years old, the rest, from the looks of it, were all over thirty, and some were probably approaching forty. Their expressions were mostly dull and sorrowful, and as for their complexion, it could be said to be uniform. Whether on their faces or arms, they would immediately remind one of a pair of bound feet that had been wrapped for decades, the kind of ashen white color when the foot binding cloths were just unwrapped.</p>
<p>The female prisoners seemed to be on very good terms with Ms. Suo Zhang. During the ten minutes we lingered outside their fence, several of them handed her the finished shoe soles to be taken to the customers outside. Because the general fee for someone to make shoes outside is one and a half dimes per shoe, and the rags and hemp thread are provided by the shoe owner, but when female prisoners make shoes for people, not only is the labor cost reduced to one dime, but the female prisoners must also provide their own hemp thread, so there are quite a few people who take the opportunity to take advantage of the situation and bring shoe soles for the female prisoners to make. In addition to asking her to bring shoe soles, there was another woman with a worried look on her face who earnestly asked Ms. Suo Zhang to help her write a petition. According to the female prison staff member, this woman is from a certain village in He County. Because of adultery with her uncle's son, she was sued by her husband and has now been sentenced to four months of imprisonment in Ping Le. However, her husband was not satisfied and is still asking the court to have her transferred to the detention center in her original hometown to imprison her, in order to shame her. The reason why she wants to write a petition is to state that she herself does not want to be transferred to another prison.</p>
<p>Leaving the prison cell, I talked with Ms. Suo Zhang for a while. She told me that among the male prisoners, there are cases of banditry, theft, land disputes, debt disputes, human trafficking, murder, etc., but among the female prisoners, nine out of ten are accused by their husbands or by their clansmen because of adultery. Even that youngest female prisoner standing by the door was also because she had another lover. One night, when her husband picked up a kitchen knife and ran to kill her lover, she had no choice but to help protect the person and killed her husband; she has now been sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>With my mind full of dark and terrible fantasies, I walked out of the detention center door. On the road, I thought of my cousin-in-law. Hasn't my cousin-in-law and the female perfumer in his store been having an affair for two years? My cousin knows all the details, and even helped them get abortions twice. Judging from the situation in the prison, if a married woman has an affair with someone, even if her own husband does not prosecute, the clansmen and people in society will still place her under the law; but if a married man -- like my cousin-in-law -- has an affair with someone, not only does his wife not sue him, but she also tries to take care of him, and the clansmen and people in society all say that he is very capable.</p>
<p>To put it another way, this unequal treatment of men and women in adultery cases has become a thing of the past. Now there are new regulations for absolutely equal criminal law for men and women; and according to the predictions of Mr. Wang Chonghui and Mr. Fu Bingchang, in the future, when this new criminal law is implemented, most husbands will be sued by their wives, and the prisons will be overcrowded due to the imprisonment of these married men. From now on, I will watch with new eyes, especially to see if my cousin will seize the magic weapon of the new provisions of Article 239 of the Criminal Law to sue her husband who has been having an affair for more than two years.</p>
<h3 id="e231">On George Sand <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Gou</p>
<p>If I wanted to find a great writer who has always been rebelling against reality in the past women's literature of various countries in the world, then I would think that only George Sand of France can be selected.</p>
<p>Most of the past women writers are nothing more than two types: the first is the appendage of nobles or official families, and the second is a prostitute-like figure who sells songs. The status given to women in history made it difficult for them to develop in other aspects except for being these two kinds of "talents." However, we do not deny that there are also one or two exceptions. The role of those one or two exceptions is often produced due to certain conditions during social changes, and their outstanding points are often even more surprising than those of accomplished men of the same era. This is a powerful factual counterattack against the theory that women are innately inferior to men advocated by those scientists who do not understand historicity. The great George Sand that I am going to talk about now is one of these outstanding roles.</p>
<p>Those who write literary history have always simply listed George Sand in romantic literature, and have summarily ignored her true value. For example, Lan Song, a relatively progressive literary historian in France, called her novels "lyrical novels" of romanticism when talking about her. But is George Sand really just a romantic lyrical novelist? I dare say no, absolutely not! We should correctly understand this great female writer, and we should rescue her from the fog.</p>
<p>George Sand was born into a noble family. She was the daughter of the landlord Du Pan, but she left her environment and went on a road that was completely opposite to her origin. She abandoned her husband, went to Paris alone, and used a rebellious pen to write a large number of works that opposed the social system at that time. At that time in France, it was the time when the July Revolution of 1848 was brewing, and this tide of social change pushed the kind people of the middle class with aristocratic blood flowing in their veins to a leaping future. George Sand appeared before us in this way.</p>
<p>Her early works such as "Lelia" and "Jacques" are called "love novels" by literary historians, but in fact, that is not the case at all. Those novels mainly focus on the issues of sex and marriage, and are definitely not simply about "love." George Sand believed that marriage must have love, that love can prevent marriage from becoming vulgar or tragic, and that marriage must have absolute freedom to be transformed into something sacred, that is, when the feelings between husband and wife break down, they must be free to divorce, and there should be no hypocrisy or accommodation. This theory may not seem new today, but at that time in Europe, it was the vanguard against the aristocratic marriage system. George Sand used the protagonists in her novels to prove all of this, and her attitude, like her own behavior, was extraordinarily firm and unambiguous.</p>
<p>However, the problems she delved into were not limited to this. After she expressed her opinions on the issues of sex and marriage in this way, she began to work on general social issues. Novels such as "The Miller of Angibautt" and "The Sin of Mr. Antoine" were her second step of work. In the former, the heroine is a female landlord who is willing to marry a worker; in the latter, the hero is an aristocrat who is willing to hand over his property after death to a landlord who is willing to sacrifice himself and implement a new system. She was almost relentlessly attacking the family property system, and she created many characters to speak on her behalf. We can say that her early works were her offerings to the human family problem, and her second step of social novels was the solution from human physiology to human economy. Needless to say, the society she idealized was not a truly realizable society, but that is another question, and she herself never failed to be great.</p>
<p>Her later works were completely inclined towards peasants, and the significance of this has not been explained in literary history. This is also not accidental. The society George Sand fundamentally idealized was one in which human beings could obtain physiological and economic freedom, and at the same time, she also recognized that to obtain this freedom, everything pressing on the people's heads must be denied. She was friends with Pierre Leroux and jointly published a publication that contributed to the revolution, and she had contact with many famous people in the labor movement at that time. She was pursuing her ideal, hoping that the revolution of 1848 would give her the realization of an ideal society. However, in fact, after the July Revolution, she did not get anything like what she had imagined. Not only did this make her very disappointed, but the result of this disappointment made her escape back to the countryside of her childhood. In these later works, such as "La Petite Fadtte" and "Francois le Champt", she described the deeds of peasants, but she never gave up her claims: she always directed her affirmative writing towards poor peasants and hardworking farmers, while she always used negative writing for landlords and others.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the love story between George Sand and the poet Musset, and everyone knows that George Sand later abandoned Musset, but no one has ever explained the social significance contained in this literary romance that has been passed down for thousands of years. In my opinion, the reason why George Sand could not finally live to old age with Musset was because their own thoughts were inconsistent. Musset was a representative of the declining aristocracy. He had welcomed Napoleon and even vilified the criminals who killed Louis Philippe. In his later work, "Confession d'nu enfant du Siecle", he would also criticize Voltaire. Such a reactionary poet would be very difficult to integrate with the populist George Sand. In this romance, we can precisely prove the irreconcilable differences between the two representatives of the aristocratic class after the split at that time.</p>
<p>In short, George Sand is a great writer, and I hope that literary historians, especially those who lavishly talk about women's literature, will use new perspectives to do some research on her. The purpose of this short article of mine is for this reason.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Current Status of American Laboring Women <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xiuying</p>
<p>There are approximately 1,600,000 laboring women in the United States today. Proportionally by age, about 15% are under 20 years old, and 37% are under 25 years old. Among them, there are hundreds of thousands of child laborers.</p>
<p>They are mostly distributed in the textile industry, garment industry, food industry, leather industry, tobacco industry, and hardware industry.</p>
<p>Before Roosevelt's New Deal, their working hours were generally limited to no more than 54 hours per week (general wages in the United States are calculated on a weekly basis). However, these regulations were merely examples, and capitalists rarely complied. For instance, Pennsylvania law stipulates that women and child laborers should not work more than 54 hours per week. In reality, female workers had to work 11 or 12 hours a day.</p>
<p>After the New Deal was announced in the spring of 1933, only a small number of enterprises temporarily reduced working hours. For example, silk factories had weekly working hours of 36.9 hours in March 1933, which were reduced to 33.9 hours by September 1933. In the cotton weaving industry, weekly working hours in March 1933 were 44.1 hours, which were reduced to 35.8 hours by September of the same year. However, in other enterprises, the average weekly working hours in the fall of 1933 increased compared to March of the same year. For example, in tobacco factories, working hours increased from 36.5 hours to 38.5 hours per week; in the electrical machinery industry, they increased from 28 hours to 33.4 hours. Furthermore, capitalists forced workers to increase their labor rate and shorten their meal and bathroom break times during the reduced working hours to compensate for the losses incurred during the shortened time! For example, workers who previously manufactured 100 products in 60 hours per week now have to manufacture the same number of products in 40 hours.</p>
<p>Night work is still very common, although the laws of many states clearly prohibit female and child laborers from doing night work. However, capitalists do not comply. The example below is already a very "polite compliance" with the law: A female worker in New York State worked from 7:30 a.m. until 12:06 a.m. the next day, but her work record stated that she worked until 9:30 p.m. that day. When she argued with the foreman, the foreman said, "Yes, I know. But saying 9:30 p.m. sounds much better than saying 12:06 a.m.!"</p>
<p>American laboring women work such long hours, but their wages are pitifully low. Female workers who earn $14.30 for every 100 hours of work often say, "If I pay for food, I can't afford rent; if I pay rent, I have nothing to eat." However, these wages are higher compared to those of female workers in other enterprises—who are paid on a weekly basis. The wages of some female workers surveyed by a factory inspection team in 1933 were almost unbelievable, only one to five dollars per week!</p>
<p>From Roosevelt's New Deal, which stipulates that weekly wages should not be lower than $12 to $14, it seems that a daily wage of $2 is much higher than a weekly wage of $2. However, if one considers the current standard of living in the United States, it becomes clear that these "higher" wages still cannot sustain life. Moreover, in some places, the wages of female workers have actually decreased since the implementation of the New Deal. For example, in June 1933, the weekly wage of female workers in New York State was $12.53, a 16% decrease compared to the same month last year; the weekly wage of female workers in Illinois was $12.03 in December 1933, a 25% decrease compared to the same month last year. The decrease in wages is naturally related to the increase in unemployed workers in the United States during the economic panic—according to statistics from the Milton Institute, there were a total of 17,034,000 unemployed workers in the United States before May 1933. With so many unemployed workers, capitalists can pay workers very low wages.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the wages of American laboring women are lower than those of men, with some differences reaching 50%. Moreover, the wages of Black female workers in the United States are even lower than those of White female workers. Black female workers are mostly distributed in manufacturing and machinery industries, tobacco factories, garment industries, food industries, and other enterprises. They mostly do those heavy, dirty, and "lowest-class jobs."</p>
<p>The wages earned by American laboring women are so meager, but the cost of living remains high. Especially since inflation, prices have uniformly increased. As a result, even employed female workers are in a state of semi-starvation. For example, a female worker with a typical weekly income of $4 has to spend $0.20 on transportation and $0.30 on food each day, totaling $0.50 per day, or $3 per week. With the remaining $1, she still has to pay for rent, electricity, clothes, etc. In addition to working long hours in factories, laboring women also have many tasks waiting for them at home: cooking, laundry, feeding children, etc.</p>
<p>Thus, excessive labor in factories every day, coupled with housework, severely depletes their vitality, causing them to age prematurely.</p>
<p>While thousands upon thousands of female workers are doing processing work, doing night work, ruining their health, and even losing their lives, on the other hand, there are nearly four million women who have lost their jobs and are waiting for work. Moreover, among all employed female workers, 27% are doing part-time work.</p>
<p>These facts prove that in the months following the implementation of Roosevelt's New Deal, the working hours of American female workers are still extended, wages are still meager, and the number of unemployed female workers continues to increase. At the same time, these facts also make American laboring women realize that relying on capitalists to seek happiness for workers is a dream. They can only rely on their own strength and strive hard to achieve everything they desire.</p>

<p>— Shi</p>
<p>(1) Social Activities of Indian Women</p>
<p>Indian women, both in the past and present, have made significant contributions to science, religion, and the stability and happiness of society. However, organized activities have only recently begun.</p>
<p>Currently, their most important work is in the political sphere, namely participating in the Indian independence movement, fighting for freedom alongside men, and making enormous sacrifices. The women's suffrage movement began in 1917, when representatives of women across India visited Mr. Montagu, the British Secretary of State for India, who came to India, requesting equal political rights with men. Although the central parliament could not have female representatives, local governments granted them civil rights, giving millions of women the right to participate in politics within the scope of local politics. As a result, Dr. Reddi became the Deputy Speaker of the Madras Legislative Council.</p>
<p>In the British-Indian Round Table Conference in London, India had three female representatives in attendance. The recent constitution will grant six million women the right to participate in politics, with forty-four women serving as members of the state legislative assemblies.</p>
<p>The activities of Indian women are not limited to politics. They are also interested in education, social reform, social services, and other matters. Many women serve as lawyers, doctors, and professors.</p>
<p>The world-renowned educator Lady Lai is a member of the Calcutta University Council. In 1927, two female judges were appointed in the major cities of Bombay and Madras. Bombay has about sixteen female judges, and Madras has even more.</p>
<p>In 1920, India not only granted women the right to participate in politics but also appointed two women as legislative members. A female member of the Travancore legislature became the Minister of Health, and the famous female poet Naidu was elected as the Speaker of the Indian National Congress during the parliamentary session in 1925.</p>
<p>The Indian representative who began attending the Geneva League of Nations Commission this year to discuss issues related to the trafficking of women and children is also a woman.</p>
<p>Indian women, realizing the mission they bear in life, strive to develop the women's movement despite their weak abilities and regardless of obstacles ahead, hoping to contribute to humanity.</p>
<p>(2) Spanish Government Appoints Women as Special Ambassadors</p>
<p>Ms. Espina, a famous Spanish female writer, was recently appointed by the government as a special ambassador to attend the national founding ceremony of Peru in South America in 1935. It is also rumored that Ms. Espina will be the recipient of the next Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>Banks Pounce on Foreign Exchange, Once Breaking 90 Yuan</p>
<p>Balance Tax Was Low, Eventually Falling 1.1 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a consistent drop in British and American silver prices. It immediately rose upon opening, but optimism was still difficult to maintain. Banks lacked a selling appetite and instead pounced on settlement, causing the domestic market to tighten suddenly, briefly breaking through the 90-yuan mark. Subsequently, the balance tax was lowered by 0.025, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and confidence ultimately waned. As a result, continued declines were seen. The deteriorated confidence truly disheartened buyers. Upon inspection, overseas silver markets saw consistent declines in British and American markets, with the forward silver price in Montevideo also falling by half a point. Exchange rates uniformly decreased, and London spot gold fell by 3.5 pence. Over-the-counter pre-market trading opened at 88.9 yuan, showing no firm rise, leading to a setback immediately after opening. When the Central Bank announced its benchmark prices, the British remained stable while the American shrank by 0.0125, the customs gold unit fell by 0.0005, and the standard gold price retreated to 1010.2 yuan before continuing to decline. However, the opening was still high, and the market remained relatively stable after opening. Banks showed no selling appetite and instead pounced on settlement, leading to a situation where demand exceeded supply and gradually pushed the price upward. Although there was intraday consolidation, the domestic market remained tight, and banks' buying appetite was exceptionally strong. Sen Changyong persistently purchased, causing the gold price to break through the 90-yuan mark. However, due to the continued selling by large accounts, the market stabilized slightly thereafter. The announcement of the silver balance tax, lowered by 0.00025 and levied at 6.75%, calculated with the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 5.6875 pence, made further rises difficult. Hua Shang's sentiment weakened, and the foreign exchange market also turned stable. The gold market gradually declined. Subsequently, Western banks even started unloading, and the foreign exchange market slightly loosened. Confidence was already poor, and the selling momentum was triggered, making it difficult to control. Buyers' intentions turned pessimistic, leading to a decline. However, because the foreign exchange market remained stable, it was difficult to settle American dollars at 33.375 yuan for February. After the price decreased, there was still support, and the market rebounded around noon. Upon inspecting the morning market conditions, it was initially firm but then weakened, resulting in a continued decline. Looking ahead, it is feared that a rising trend will be difficult to form before the swap period because buyers, restricted by unfavorable swaps, will not dare to act rashly. Now, the morning market conditions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening was 987.1 yuan, 1 yuan higher than the previous close. Fuxing Yongyuan sold positions, reducing the price to 6.4 yuan. Citibank purchased spot shillings at 5.6875 pence. Dadecheng and Fuchang bought in limited quantities, and the situation remained stable. MacKay purchased U.S. dollars for January at 75. Hengyu, Tongchun, Hengxing, Hongxing, Yuanyi, Yuanchang, Yongfu, Xingzhaofeng, and Changlian all bought together, raising the price to 8.7 yuan. Jinfeng, Yongyongfeng, Dayuan, Fuxing, Yongqing, Yushunmao sold positions, reducing the price to 7.5 yuan. However, the domestic market was extremely tight. Jiaotong purchased shillings for January at 375. Sentiment was positive. Qianchangxiang and Dachangxiang settled with Hengyu, stabilizing the market. Subsequently, Zhejiang purchased U.S. dollars for January at 6875. Sen Changyong, Yuanchangyong, Yuli, Hengchangyong, and Dadecheng continued to purchase. Yuqingyong sold, but because the bank wanted to settle U.S. dollars for January at 625, the price once rose to 91 yuan. Yuqingyong, Chunyuan, Yongshenkang, Hengyu, Yicheng, and Dingkang successively divested. The silver balance tax was lowered by 0.025, gradually retreating to 88 yuan, and the market mostly fluctuated. After that, Huabi and HSBC came out with U.S. dollars for January at 6875, and Dalian companies, Fuan, Fuxingyong, Fuchang, Qianchangxiang, and Chunyuan Yong all supplied, reducing the price to 5.2 yuan. Hengyu, Fuchang, Fuyu, Yuqingyong, Yuanchangyong entered positions, raising the price to 6.4 yuan. Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Tongfu, Fuyu, and Xingzhaofeng supplied positions, further reducing the price to 4.1 yuan. However, the foreign exchange market was stable, and it was difficult to settle American dollars at 375 for February. Hengyu and Sen Changyong entered positions. Dingchang and Richang sold, still struggling. The noon close was 985 yuan. After the market closed, Yongde, Dachangxiang, and Hengxingyuan sold, while Bingxing, Yicheng, and Hengyu entered and were relatively stable. Finally, Fuyu suddenly sold, the trading was quiet, and the price fell to 4.5 yuan. Upon inspecting the morning session, the highest price was 991 yuan, and the lowest price was 984.1 yuan, with a total fluctuation of 6.9 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by 1.1 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, according to the Central Bank's standard gold price, retreated to 1010.2 yuan, roughly 25 yuan below the closing price, 1 yuan less than the previous close. The book price for January was 985 yuan, with a replenishment of 976 yuan in the morning. Spot gold was still 1 yuan lower than the benchmark price, at 986.1 yuan. The spot market remained quiet, with no buying or selling interest. Tianjin goods, priced at 3 yuan above the benchmark gold price, also lacked transactions. Customer sales were sluggish, and the benchmark gold reserves were abundant, with the trend seeming extremely stable.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was flat. Sen Changyong, Dingtai, Tongtai, Changhong, Kangyong, Wanxingchang, Dayongfeng, Hengchangyong, Yuanchangyong, and Fuxing were on the buying side. Shunmao, Yuqingyong, Fuxingyong, Xiangfeng, Futaiheng, Dafayong, Wang Fayong, Yiyu, Xingzhaofeng, Hengxingyuan, and Chunyuan were on the selling side. Qianchangxiang and Dadecheng advanced first and then retreated. Yuanyi and Yifengyong exited first and then entered. Dalian companies, Wanxing, completed over 900 transactions, rolling in over 500. Shunli completed over 500 transactions, rolling in about 100. Guang companies, Shengda and Hengxing, advanced and then retreated, with few transactions. The total number of transactions that day was 38,738.</p>
<p>The lineup for the January period included 2,900 long positions in Zhengchang, over 2,000 in Yuanmaoyong, over 1,700 in Dachangxiang, over 1,500 in Fuchang, over 1,000 each in Changshengyong and Sen Changyong, over 900 each in Bingxing and Shenkang, over 700 each in Tianfeng and Yingxiang, over 600 each in Fuxingyongyuan and Chunyuan Dayong, over 500 each in Chunyuan Yongjuchang, Hongkangyong, and Wuchangxiang, and over 400 each in Runchang, Yuhuixiang, Hengtai, and Dakangyong.

<h3 id="e234">Silver Market Falls, Foreign Exchange Tightens <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Hua Shang Banks' Buying Interest Is Quite Strong</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, the close of the London large positions, both near and far term, contracted by 0.01875. American silver contracted by 0.0025, the forward silver price also dropped by 0.0005, and London spot gold fell by 3.5 pence. The British exchange rate against the U.S. contracted by 0.0125, the British exchange rate against the French fell by 25 basis points, the U.S. exchange rate against the British fell by 0.015, and the U.S. exchange rate against the French contracted by 0.0025. The foreign exchange market opened this morning with near-term selling prices: British exchange at 1 shilling 4.6875 pence, U.S. exchange at 34.375 yuan, compared to the previous close, British remained flat while American tightened by 0.0125. When the Central Bank announced its benchmark prices, the British remained flat while the American contracted by 0.0125. The customs gold unit dropped by 0.0005. The market was still flat after opening. Banks' acceptance was quite strong, and the process tightened. When HSBC announced its benchmark prices, the British remained flat while the American contracted by 0.000625. Although it was a small foreign exchange squeeze, the process tightened suddenly due to banks' efforts to settle. The buying interest in Hua Shang banking circles was even stronger. The announced silver balance tax contracted by 0.0025, at 6.25%. Calculated with the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 5.6875 pence, Hua Shang's sentiment turned soft, and there was a slight loosening. Subsequently, Western banks slightly unloaded, and the process hardened, but it was also mediocre. It was still difficult to settle American dollars for February at 375. By the noon close, the near-term selling prices were British exchange at 1 shilling 4.625 pence and U.S. exchange at 34.25 yuan, compared to the previous close, British tightened by 0.000625 and American tightened by 0.0025. Hua Shang first exited and then settled, and after settling, they still sold over 300,000 U.S. dollars. Hua Shang banks had quite a bit of buying interest. Now, the morning transaction prices are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The British exchange opened this morning with the near-term selling price at 1 shilling 4.6875 pence. Citibank purchased spot at 5.6875 pence. HSBC sold to MacKay at 0.0025 for February.

<h3 id="e235">Foreign Call Loans Are Stagnant, White Head-Scratching <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>There are few days left until the year-end settlement. Normally, bank funds will inevitably be tighter. However, recently, foreign firms have made a large number of loans on collateral. The call loan interest rate is only about 0.002, so the foreign call loan market price is unlikely to rise within the year. Even the head-scratching situation will inevitably tend to be loose and excessive. Yesterday's foreign call loan market was the same as the previous day. The morning and afternoon markets were both 0.0023, and the head-scratching premium was still white-washed. Call loan transactions, morning market transfers, and new transactions totaled over 3.4 million, afternoon market transactions totaled over 300,000, and small general association transactions totaled over 500,000. Foreign collateral loan transactions had redemptions of over 900,000 and new loans of over 1.3 million. Banks' remittances: foreign banks remitted over 1.9 million in bills, various exchange goods collateral and miscellaneous redemptions totaled over 3.5 million, telegraphic remittances totaled over 400,000, foreign exchange settlements totaled over 600,000, and warehousing totaled 400,000. Hua Shang banks remitted over 2.1 million in bills, various exchange goods collateral and miscellaneous redemptions totaled over 3.9 million, customs duty totaled over 400,000, telegraphic remittances totaled over 500,000, foreign exchange settlements totaled over 900,000, and warehousing totaled 500,000. Japanese banks remitted over 1.8 million in bills, various exchange goods collateral and miscellaneous redemptions totaled over 2.9 million, foreign exchange settlements totaled over 700,000, and warehousing totaled 400,000. Qianzhuang foreign public vouchers totaled over 41.1 million, foreign head-scratching redemptions totaled over 7.4 million, various exchange remittances totaled over 600,000, banknotes recovered totaled over 800,000, issued totaled over 1.2 million, spot redemptions totaled over 30,000, security source totaled over 1.2 million, and stomach drain totaled 400,000. Furthermore, the total number of exchanges at the city's ticket clearing house on the 8th was 7.9 million silver dollars and another 1,367.79 yuan, including 3.598572 silver dollars and 0.2 yuan, and 4.641510 silver dollars and 0.59 yuan for exchange transfers.</p>

<p>Each Yuan Only Exchanges for 2,880 Cash</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars saw light transactions in both the morning and afternoon markets, doing 833 yuan, 2 yuan less than the previous day. Only 2,000 corners were transacted in the morning market, and there were no transactions in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars initially fell by 0.002 in the morning market, doing 759.8 yuan, but surged by 6 yuan in the afternoon market, to 766 yuan. As a result, it continued to rise by 6 yuan compared to the previous day. 110,000 corners were transacted in the morning market and 70,000 corners were transacted in the afternoon market. The copper coin situation remained stagnant, at 2,880 cash, 3,000 cash less than the previous day. The transaction volume was 23,904 strings of cash, equivalent to 8,300 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Securities and Public Bonds Fluctuate, Momentum Shaken <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange and foreign exchange rates remained unchanged. As the Fifth Plenary Session is approaching, logically, there should be a slight increase. However, there was an overabundance of bulls, mostly speculative and insubstantial. Political rumors suddenly emerged in the market, including talk of issuing 24th Year public bonds, causing the bull momentum to falter. Market prices then trended downwards. At this time of high bull positions, even slight rumors easily cause declines but make rises difficult. As the reporter previously mentioned, unfortunately, this prediction came true. Current market conditions still show excessively high forward prices, with foreign exchange rates exceeding one percent interest, making arbitrage unprofitable. Therefore, there are few buyers for forward contracts. When buying, it is more profitable to focus on recent contracts. However, market speculators are buying distant contracts instead of recent ones. This is a weakness of the bulls. If foreign exchange rates do not ease and arbitrage does not stimulate activity, market prices will not easily rise. With the opening of the conference, even slight rumors are enough to shake the market. Therefore, there are still waves ahead. Yesterday's activity showed initial firmness at the opening, with news of troop reduction and "19 Customs" bonds. However, supply gradually exceeded demand, and the "50 Bond" saw some selling, leading to a slight decrease of one or two jiao. As the trend changed, market sentiment shifted. As a result, the secondary market saw a unanimous downward trend, with the "50 Bond" and others continuing to be sold, falling another one or two jiao, leading to the rise of rumors. In the afternoon, sentiment was weak, rumors persisted, and prices fell another three or four jiao. The market failed to stabilize at the close, continuing to fall two or three jiao. Bullish selling slightly increased. In the end, market prices fell from one or two jiao to seven or eight jiao. The outlook is not optimistic. The total trading volume was 9,635,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the comparison table below (unit: yuan and 10%; unit: hundreds of yuan):</p>

<p>A report from the Xin Feng Foreign Firm states that yesterday (the 7th), the New York stock market showed mixed performance with a slightly weak trend due to profit-taking by bulls and mixed commercial news. However, special stocks continued to rise sharply. Holmes Stock Gold Mine surged ten dollars to three hundred and eighty dollars. The world's copper mine owners have decided to meet in the United States in January to discuss the issue of reducing production. Therefore, metal stocks generally showed strength. Railway operating reports and freight volumes were poor, but this did not have a significant impact on railway stocks. The bond market showed mixed performance with slight gains. Small exchange stocks showed a uniform weak trend due to profit-taking by bulls and the sale of Parker Lamp stocks. The Dow Jones New York indexes are listed below:</p>
<p>Index | 6th | 7th | Change</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks | 103.47 | 103.16 | Down 0.31</p>

<h3 id="e239">Cotton Yarn Futures Market Still Supported by Spot Yarn <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending weaker due to softening news from overseas cotton markets, causing some unease. However, the long positions of Tongcheng Company remain unchanged. However, in general, small investors are aware that the end of the year is approaching rapidly, and various parties are handling settlements. There will be a period of sluggishness in spot yarn business, and there is little interest in taking long positions. Therefore, the market is presenting a situation of holding back.</p>
<p>The Gold Rooster declined slightly. The opening price of the standard yarn futures market was weak due to the fatigue of US cotton and the rebound of Indian cotton by one rupee. Buying interest in the market was not strong, and the situation was bleak. However, the amount purchased by major players remained unchanged. New sellers did not dare to act rashly due to the strong efforts of the bulls. Therefore, trading was very light, and prices for all months fell by one or two jiao. In the afternoon, it was reported that there were 1,000 bales of spot yarn transactions, and market sentiment was still maintained. However, as raw cotton fell back, the yarn market was not greatly affected. The price for the near month rose by twelve jiao, and the price for the distant month fell by two jiao. The trading volume of the standard yarn futures market is usually published on the blackboard in the exchange market. However, due to some issues, it will not be published for the time being. The blackboard will be removed today. It is found that 600 bales were sold by Run Kang, 1,050 bales by Chang Feng, 300 bales by Yi Chang, 350 bales by Xin Chang, 500 bales by Yu Kang, 500 bales by Yuan Yi, 650 bales by Shen Ji, 600 bales by Da Feng, and 250 bales by Tong Ji. 600 bales were bought by Sui Long, 450 bales by Jin Chang, 650 bales by Ming De, 250 bales by Yong Chang, 1,000 bales by Da Fu, 3,000 bales by Geng Feng, and 350 bales by Jun Chang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Type | High Price | Low Price | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>December | 184.0 | 183.8 | 183.8 | Down 0.10 | 36,600</p>
<p>January | 184.9 | 184.4 | 184.8 | Up 0.2 | 53,750</p>
<p>February | 186.7 | 186.1 | 186.5 | Down 0.30 | 56,790</p>

<p>Total | | | | | 271,100</p>
<p>Spot sales of 1,000 bales. Strong spot yarn sales were good. According to statistics, various firms bought a total of 1,050 bales throughout the day. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of the various firms are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 190, Luzhou 30, Changsha 400</p>
<p>Inland 140, Northern Firms 10, Da Tong 5</p>
<p>Ningbo 15, Fellow Merchants 10, Shantou 20</p>
<p>Yunnan 200, Jiangxi 5, Sichuan 25</p>

<p>The decline in the cotton market is particularly severe. Due to the news that the area of US cotton fields has increased and the production volume may be 2.5 million to 3 million bales higher than last year, people cannot help but be moved. Another saying is that several yarn mills have reduced their production to maintain their base due to the high price of cotton and the low price of yarn, and the demand for raw materials has decreased. As a result, selling has slightly increased, and the market has fallen. However, the situation in the Indian cotton market is still high.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Down Four Jiao and a Half) The standard cotton futures market opened, and the market situation was weak. It was rumored in the market the previous day that Indian cotton firms were willing to pay to settle the cotton they had previously sold short. This issue has not materialized. In addition, the US cotton telegram fell slightly by two pounds, and Indian cotton showed mixed gains and losses. The price of gold was flat. Therefore, there was a lack of buyers in the market, and the market became weaker and weaker. All months fell by two and a half to three jiao. In the afternoon, due to the news from the United States that was favorable to short sellers, and because most cotton prices were higher than yarn prices, manufacturers could not maintain their positions. Selling became even more intense. Each month fell by another five to three hundred dan. 3,200 dan were sold by Taixing, 6,300 dan by Tongxing, 1,500 dan by Yuan Yi, 5,600 dan by Yi Cheng, 1,700 dan by Ji Kang, 1,200 dan by Da Chang, 1,300 dan by Shengyuan, 1,200 dan by Xinheng, 1,600 dan by Gengfeng, 1,000 dan by Taichang, 1,900 dan by Yuanxingchang, and 1,400 dan by Yifeng. 1,100 dan were bought by Jinchang, 2,100 dan by Yuanda, 2,500 dan by Mingde, 1,100 dan by Zhenda, 1,000 dan by Shenyu, 2,500 dan by Yichang, 1,100 dan by Changfeng, 1,100 dan by Yifeng, 8,700 dan by Changhe, 1,000 dan by Ruiyuan, 1,100 dan by Yuan Yi, and 1,900 dan by Xincheng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>(No Bales of Raw Cotton Traded) Spot cotton sales remained sluggish, and factory demand was quiet. Spot cotton trading was completely stopped. The source was 2,510 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<p>- Causing Short Selling -</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially strengthened due to foreign merchants buying, but later fluctuated due to short selling in the South and sales in New Orleans. According to reports, the government has released 200,000 bales of pledged cotton, causing short selling. The large number indicates that the market's absorption capacity is still good. Last week, yarn mills purchased a total of 259,000 bales, with spot prices unchanged and futures prices falling by two to three pounds. British cotton spot prices fell by two points, and futures prices fell by one or two points. Indian cotton strengthened due to purchases by cotton traders and speculators. Pingle fell by two and a half jiao, Aomura fell by seven and a half jiao, and Bairuo Creek rose by one rupee. The original telegrams are listed on the left (7th telegram):</p>

<p>New York, December 7th Telegram Reports on the Cotton Market Situation for the Week: At the beginning of this week, bull liquidations and Southern sales were absorbed by the market. Prices strengthened after President Roosevelt announced his attitude towards the Bankhead Act. It is believed that President Roosevelt's proposal to exempt farmers producing no more than two bales of cotton from restrictions will secure President Roosevelt's endorsement of the proposal at the Farmers' Referendum Assembly on December 14th. After the market price rose, retail investors liquidated and Southern sellers also sold slightly. However, traders wanted to wait for the government cotton production report or other driving forces. Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) personnel estimated that cotton production under the voluntary cotton field consolidation program, if the Bankhead Act continues to be implemented, would be around 12 million bales. If it does not continue, cotton production may be around 13 million bales. Some parties purchased October futures during the week because the new cotton price discount would be reduced if the Bankhead Act continued. However, traders believe that the tight spot cotton market will keep old cotton prices high. At the same time, traders are more concerned about the distribution of cotton than the possible changes in cotton supply figures.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Grain Futures – Flour and Wheat Markets Recover <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Flour: After the opening of the market yesterday morning, the prices of all months showed a stable fluctuation. As for the quotation of foreign wheat, there was a difference of 48 points between Chicago. Outside of Canada, it was 8 points to 10 jiao. When the price was opened, due to the continuation of the previous day's foreign wheat, the sentiment of the outsiders was quite loose. Then, the enthusiasm of various factories to sell near and even all periods was reduced. Although the issue of tax increases has come to an end for the time being, it is not yet certain whether it can be fulfilled according to the manufacturers' requests in the future. The lack of strong factory selling and the stabilization of sentiment are undoubtedly related. By the time the afternoon market opened, sentiment in both near and distant months had gradually rebounded. Since the outsiders were floating short, they were deeply afraid that foreign wheat would change again due to Saturday and that the fluctuations would be huge. Therefore, a small number of floating shorts gradually covered their positions. In addition, the buying interest of outsiders did not decrease, and the shouting price gradually increased. As a result, this month's price rebounded by 1 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day, January's price rebounded by 1 fen and 2.5 li, February's price rebounded by 1.5 fen, March's price rebounded by 2 fen, April's price rebounded by 1.5 fen, and May's price rebounded by 1 fen and 2.5 li.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat futures market showed a stable trend in all months after the morning opening. The quotation for foreign wheat had little fluctuation. When the price was opened, due to the fact that the buying and selling of insiders and outsiders had not decreased for a long time, the transaction was lonely and there was no change. By the time the afternoon market opened, the flour market was tired but firm, and the increase in tax on foreign wheat was not yet certain, so the buying interest in near and distant months was relatively strong, and the price was raised by 2-3 fen. According to the bottom price of domestic wheat, there is still an opportunity for improvement in the later stages. As a result, this month's price was better by 3 fen, and February's price was better by 3 fen. There were no other changes. The spot wheat market saw good performance in high-quality wheat, up 12 fen, while the middle and lower grades were flat. Shandong Guide wheat opened at 4 yuan, Xuzhou Bengbu wheat opened at 3 yuan 9 jiao 89 fen, and Yaowan wheat opened at 3 yuan 9 jiao 56 fen. 12,000 bags were taken by Fuxin and 2,000 bags were taken by Shenda.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat benefited from the delay in transportation and sales, not from the lack of domestic supply. However, because it has approached the import base price, the strong wheat price may only be a flash in the pan. The winter wheat situation is very good. News from Winnipeg indicates that Canada may sell 50 million bushels of frozen wheat to the United States, causing prices to fall back.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) The sources of various goods are still only about 30 firms (a total of nearly 5,000 piculs). Sales are weakening, and the market color is declining. Although various late-season rice continued to be purchased by Qingdao firms for more than 400 bags, they fell by an angle of one angle. Early rice from Nan Gang is stagnant and has fallen by an angle, with the exception of the Su Tong gang japonica, which is relatively rare and can barely stand firm. Du Yangjian's arrival at the port is rare, and sentiment is slightly stabilized. Those in the middle market can barely stand firm, while those with high prices have shown signs of weakness. The change in yuan means that the road is turning stagnant and has suddenly fallen by 1-2 jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 16-17 ships arrived from various roads under the river. In terms of market sales, white japonica demand is sparse, and demand for sheep Du Jianzao rice is normal. Bai Yuan Yinyuan are settled separately, and demand from liquor dealers is flat. The price of Bai Jing Yang Du Jianzao rice is stable, and the price of Bai Yuan Yinyuan is slightly tighter.</p>

<p>Spot Foreign Rice Rises by an Angle</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was very good because local customers' demand continued to be strong. Yesterday, Yongbang also made a small jiao futures of 2,000 tons and spot foreign rice of 3,000 bags, making the market more lively. In addition, the company ship Erli Caipeisimala, which was loaded with Saigon rice, encountered wind and waves in Nanyang and berthed in Singapore for repairs, so it needs to be postponed for two weeks before arriving in Shanghai. After this news spread, the atmosphere in the market was very tense. Saigon Siamese rice transactions were very strong, opening as many as 13,800 bags, and the price also rose by an angle. In addition to Yongbang's small jiao purchase in futures (Dafu sold it, February 4 yuan 8 jiao, price rose 5 fen), 200 tons were also recycled. Ke Xian opened a total of 6,700 bags and was distributed by local streets in the mainland. Because the origin reported a rise, the owners of the goods mainly shouted high, so the selling price was greatly closer to an angle to 2 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Soybean Trading Volume is Not Weak <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market, regardless of the soybeans on the Jinpu and Longhai lines, rose by 2-3 fen to 6-7 fen. The reason is that the rumored large-scale sources have not yet arrived, and the arrival is likely to be small. The Shanghai inventory is not thick, and the local road is tight, so the market situation has risen. Yesterday, the Guide bean market opened at 3 yuan, 5 jiao, 3 fen, up 3 fen compared to the previous market. Xinanzhen big grain beans opened at 3 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen. Hankou Zhaza beans opened for more than 3,000 bags, with prices ranging from 3 yuan 3 jiao 2 fen to 3 yuan 2 jiao. The high bean market continued to rise by 2 fen, and the middle and lower goods had to be raised by 6-7 fen. There are also Hankou Che Dou Chi Dou Gou Dou, the market also continued to rise by 2-3 fen. Jiujiang beans are also tight. Dalian Siping Daidou still opened at 4 yuan, the big grain seed rose by 2 fen, and the price was 4 yuan 3 jiao. Yesterday, a total of more than 6,700 bags of various beans were traded in the general market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was relatively stable. The association drew a plate of 24 rough sand white popular spot price of 18 yuan, 5 jiao, 10%. Transshipment goods 5 yuan, 2 jiao, 500 bags were traded. No. 89 He Chi spot price Gao Zhuang 14 yuan, 2 jiao, 8%, ordinary 13 yuan, 9 jiao to 8 jiao. Transshipment goods 4 yuan, 9 jiao. The new factory cotton white Zhen Yu No. 4 opened at 17 yuan, 2 jiao, and rose another 1 jiao. The newly arrived New Tide Qing products, now查 a total of more than 1,200 pieces, the number is large, and people's minds are slightly relaxed. Yesterday, 910 were opened,提 Zhuang Qing price 13 yuan, 1 jiao, 2%, Huanggang Qing 13 yuan, secondly 12 yuan, 9 jiao to 8 jiao, and Longgang Qing 12 yuan, 6 jiao, down 2-3 jiao. Quanzhou Pianqing has also lost the market, and there were two samples yesterday, the slices were thin and very good, unprecedented, so it opened to 11 yuan.</p>

<p>Raw sun-dried longan meat has been very rare in recent arrivals. The owners of the goods are quite odd and want to raise the price by two or three yuan compared to before. However, various parties in Shanghai do not have strong demand, and it is not easy to raise the price much for a while. Yesterday, it was heard that a few of them were opened, Tong'an goods rose by 1 yuan, and Shima goods rose by half a yuan. The lines did not eat much, and temporarily looked flat.</p>

<h3 id="e270">Bread for Bread's Sake <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— By Shen Lisu</p>
<p>Female Staff Member of the Bread Department at the China National Products Company</p>
<p>Interview with Miss Hua Yingying</p>
<p>Last winter, I finished my last lesson at the "Yan Mou Shi" Girls' School, completing a phase of my academic journey. During the solemn and enthusiastic graduation ceremony, I received a diploma amid the kind and smiling face of the principal.</p>
<p>Although many commercialized universities with their "open the school gates wide, no money, no entry" policy are waiting and welcoming the children of the wealthy, I am not a noble's daughter. Therefore, I had to abandon that rosy dream.</p>
<p>At the same time, I wondered whether I could truly satisfy my thirst for knowledge at a university. Moreover, even if there were profound academic principles worth learning, would they meet the needs of future society? These questions were somewhat related to my decision not to keep taking university entrance exams.</p>
<p>Distrusting modern university education, I decided to end my life as a student and become a laborer engaged in practical social work. When I shared this idea with my family, the elders unsympathetically rejected it. Their reasons were similar to those generally used to suppress women's employment, believing that women's professions were merely nominal and that women lacked the ability to work. They even said that even if society allowed women's professions to develop freely, its purpose was merely to use women to attract more of the desired clientele.</p>
<p>The elders in my family thought this way, and most people in society could not escape this paradigm. They were like black clouds obstructing the bright future of women's professions.</p>
<p>Later, the elders could not resist my firm conviction and allowed me to become a member of the intellectual workforce.</p>
<p>I started working here in the spring of this year, so it has been less than a year. Based on my experience during this time, I believe the future development of women's professions will not be discouraged by current social obstacles.</p>
<p>The company treats female and male employees equally and does not discriminate. However, due to physiological differences, female employees' work capabilities are often not as brave and lively as those of male employees. This is my subjective feeling, but based on the actual situations I have seen with female employees at work, there probably isn't a big difference.</p>
<p>When I first joined, my monthly salary was only eighteen yuan, but after two months, it was raised to twenty-four yuan. As of recently, my labor is worth thirty yuan a month.</p>
<p>Is this a lot of income? Of course! Human desires are endless, and one will not be satisfied with thirty yuan a month. Is it little? But looking closely at the current economic situation in society, even if I have a belly full of aspirations, I can't help but feel discouraged.</p>
<p>Speaking honestly, I am quite satisfied with my labor compensation. However, the work is too mechanical, and I can't help but feel a bit unhappy, like a snake coiling in my heart. Perhaps this is what is called "doing one job, complaining about it," a manifestation of the desire for novelty and aversion to the old. Generally, every professional inevitably has a sense of timidity. Most young people working in an organized and disciplined group prefer activity to stillness. Although this is a commercial group, its systematic management and strict discipline are not inferior to those of other group organizations. The department to which a certain item belongs and the specific duties of each employee are clearly and strictly defined.</p>
<p>The department I work in is the "Bread Department," which is part of the "Food Department." Across from the "Bread Department" is the "Candy Department," and each department has a female employee. The one in the "Candy Department" is my younger sister – Yingying.</p>
<p>The work in the "Bread Department" and "Candy Department" involves more stillness than activity. Although it can be busy at times, the work is too easy and I don't feel excited or interested. However, selling bread and candy, although simple, sometimes requires careful handling!</p>
<p>When a customer comes to buy bread, you need to know how to pick it up so that it doesn't lose its original beautiful packaging;</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>This work seems extremely simple and easy, but if you are slightly careless, it can lose its original smoothness because your hand gripped it too tightly. Customers spend money to buy bread, so they can freely choose. If you hand them one that looks ugly, they will refuse the first one you offer. If the one you offer next is the same, they will leave disappointed. Although we – either the employees or the customers – all know that the appearance of the bread has nothing to do with its taste, most customers still pay attention to its external appearance.</p>
<p>The working hours here are from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., a full eleven hours. It's not long, but it's not short either. Compared to the usual working hours in Chinese stores, ours are quite moderate. Although I sometimes feel mentally exhausted due to the long working hours, in the current era where the American eight-hour system has not been implemented, it cannot be said that the capitalists' treatment is harsh.</p>
<p>Chinese stores still operate during meal times, which is a common phenomenon, so of course, we are no exception. There is half an hour to leave the job during meal times. The employees of each department are divided into several shifts and take turns going to the "canteen" to eat. Someone remains on duty at the counter to make sales.</p>
<p>Lunch is from 12:00 to 1:30 p.m., and dinner is from 6:00 to 7:30 p.m. During this time, meals are served continuously, as lively as a "flowing water" banquet in a restaurant. The company provides all the meals, so employees don't have to spend extra money. Also, the company takes care of the accommodation for a small number of male employees and trainees.</p>
<p>To be fair, as far as I know, several companies of roughly the same size treat their male and female employees somewhat worse. The starting salary here is eighteen yuan, and it increases quickly, sometimes by two yuan or four yuan, and at most by six yuan, depending on the work performance. Other companies probably don't have such figures, and most of their salary increases have a rigid rule, with some increasing only after a year and others increasing twice a year. This kind of salary increase method conceals a harmful flaw for the company, which the company authorities cannot easily detect. Let me give a simple example to illustrate this flaw: For example, if an employee knows that the company's salary increase is held once a year, he can be lazy at ordinary times, perfunctorily doing his job carelessly. But when the salary increase is approaching, he can be as excited as a machine with extra oil, doing his job vigorously. Between his diligence and laziness, the company suffers a huge loss invisibly, but his salary still increases the same as other employees. This situation is like a student who usually doesn't study hard and only "burns the midnight oil" to intensify his work during the big exam. Although he manages to pass the exam, the knowledge still jumps out of his stomach in his haste. A school doesn't suffer losses from having this kind of student, but a company faces a great danger from having this kind of employee!</p>
<p>The company authorities seem to have also sensed this customer psychology. Therefore, although the bread sold here may not entirely suit the tastes of noble sons and daughters, they are unwilling to display items made from substandard materials.</p>
<p>There are probably more than a dozen types of bread sold here, as well as dozens of expensive cakes. The prices range from five cents to several dimes per piece. Beautiful decorations and neat packaging often make general customers willing to pay a high price to possess something with a beautiful appearance whose actual taste they don't even know. Therefore, among the dozens of types of bread and cakes, the decoration of a single piece of bread can cost several cents. On the consumer side, I often feel that society is becoming more and more decadent. Fortunately, the consumables I see are produced by domestic factories, which gives me a lot of peace of mind.</p>
<p>Although I have spent almost a year here, I still feel that there are many things worth learning carefully. For example, when I encounter a customer who isn't afraid of trouble, I am afraid of the trouble first. At the time, I felt that this thought was reasonable, but when I think back on it, I can't help but feel a little ashamed. Because when a customer comes to buy something, they instinctively choose the quality of the goods and the level of prices. Although some customers' attitudes toward choosing goods are not sincere, they always have the right to choose. The duty of a salesperson is to display as many similar goods as possible for them to choose from. There is absolutely no reason to refuse them the right to choose. Even if you encounter an irrational customer whose intentions are "not about the wine but about the scenery," the salesperson can try to understand them, then think of ways to deal with them separately, and absolutely not give them any bad blows because of the customer's frivolous attitude. Because losing a customer is a great loss for the company, but at the same time, it invisibly affects the future of the entire women's profession, and this loss is difficult to estimate. In this unreasonable society, the future of women's professions is covered with thorns. If we don't have the courage to cut through the thorns, then it's better to go back to the family and prepare to be someone's virtuous wife and good mother!</p>
<p>When I first started working in the bread department, I encountered many customers who came to buy bread with malicious intent. At that time, I really wanted to quit. But in the end, reason overcame the environment, and those unkind customers seemed to feel tired and gradually disappeared. Now, they can be said to have disappeared completely.</p>
<p>The company also takes the attitude of employees towards customers very seriously and absolutely does not allow employees to be impolite. There is now a training class for trainees to train them in basic business knowledge and applied English. During the day, trainees practice greeting customers politely and sales techniques in the marketplace, while also delivering invoices and collecting money in various departments.</p>
<p>I've already said a lot and should stop. But I can't bear to give up this opportunity to talk, so I might as well say it frankly!</p>
<p>Recently, I have often received letters from many unknown people who are very concerned about my private life. Some even advise me not to go to dance halls and not to engage in meaningless social interactions, which really makes me feel ashamed and grateful! Heavens! Are these people who write to me really well-intentioned? In this crime-filled social environment, I really dare not believe it, because even my parents are not always this concerned about me. However, here I cannot help but be grateful for their kindness and express myself.</p>
<p>To be frank, eleven hours of work every day is enough to exhaust all my energy. When I come back from the company, my legs often don't obey me. If I were to go to a dance hall to enjoy that kind of revelry, only I know that I don't have that courage!</p>
<p>I don't absolutely deny leisure entertainment. However, when I am occasionally mentally excited, I will quietly go to the cinema to watch a movie or be with my sister. In fact, reading novels is also a form of entertainment, so sometimes novels are my entertainment object. Also, playing ping-pong is something that my sister -- Yingying -- and I often do.</p>
<p>These people who write to me and care about my private life, it's not necessary to investigate whether their motives are well-intentioned, but at least they always haven't clearly understood the living environment of a professional.</p>

<h3 id="e271">Starting from the Oversupply of Intellectuals <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— By Liu Xin</p>
<p>In a world of economic recession, the "unemployment problem" has stumped most politicians and economists. Naturally, the oversupply of intellectuals makes the path for intellectuals even more difficult.</p>
<p>The Chinese have always held a "careerism" view of reading. Abolishing the imperial examination created a new kind of imperial examination: graduating from primary school is like passing the county-level exam, graduating from middle school is like passing the provincial-level exam, and a university diploma is naturally the ticket to the top scholar position. The traditional result of "study to become an official" is that most people tend towards liberal arts, and the path for most intellectuals is already designated as politics. However, the door to politics is too narrow, so liberal arts university students can only fall into the path of oversupply and unemployment. As for university students who study practical subjects, they also face the same path of confusion and unemployment, either because national industries are not yet developed, or because they lack real skills.</p>
<p>The Union of Vocational Movements of University Graduates already reflects all these phenomena.</p>
<p>Since intellectuals cannot enter the door to politics, they lower their standards and flock to the education sector to make a living. Graduates from education, liberal arts, law, and other departments all take the education sector as their final destination and as a place to wait for vacancies. Because Chinese education is not yet developed, the ratio of the number of middle schools to the number of primary school graduates each year is still far apart. The government does not yet have the financial resources to increase the number of schools, so private schools are springing up like mushrooms after the rain to accommodate this group of surplus university students. This kind of school is especially common in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Let us further examine the content of these schools: In terms of equipment, they are naturally simple and crude. If they can fill the bookshelves with textbooks to form a library, and slightly equip a few instruments and glass bottles to form a laboratory, then this school is considered top-notch. In terms of curriculum, one reason is that teachers' salaries are low, so it is naturally difficult to have excellent teachers to fill the positions. Also, for the sake of the school's finances, most subjects are simple and incomplete. It is even commonplace for teachers to be absent from class.</p>
<p>The most exhausting thing for those who run private schools is the problem of enrollment. The economic life of private schools depends entirely on students. In Shanghai alone, there are many private schools, and the source of students is limited, so they have to cast a wide net, using advertising to supplement the deficiencies, and using the weaknesses of students or parents to do everything possible to attract and lure them. This is a fact: It is said that the advertising fees spent by various private schools on enrollment in the newspapers during the summer vacation are no less than five or six hundred yuan. Alas - a magnificent institution of learning is transformed into a marketplace for merchants to solicit customers. If you say that Chinese education is not failing with this kind of education, there is no justice!</p>
<p>Of course, since the relationship between schools and students is built on a monetary relationship, and is not rooted in academic research, it is inevitable that it is difficult to implement strict systems in school management and teaching. As soon as you walk into a school, you can smell the atmosphere of arrogance and disorder. I once heard someone say: "Strictness doesn't work! If you are strict, the students will run away. Where will we get the money to pay for the eight or nine hundred yuan monthly rent and the food for dozens of people?" This is truly a "penetrating criticism"!</p>
<p>The countryside is bankrupt. Natural disasters and man-made disasters have brought the middle and lower classes in the countryside closer to the poverty line. When large stores and large companies are frantically shouting about big discounts, big sales, and big sacrifices, our schools are also very depressed because the purchasing power of students or parents is weak. Our intellectuals - the leaders of the schools - seeing that their careers are about to fail miserably, cannot help but make a final struggle and propose a method of reducing tuition fees, which is the same meaning as the "special" big sales and "desperate" big discounts of large companies and large stores. Poor students who come to study still cannot increase as expected.</p>
<p>The problem is gradually expanding. How do we get money for rent, meals, salaries, ...? - Teachers demand wages, principals run away, and then schools close ... Scenes emerge endlessly in the education sector.</p>
<p>This is not just a simple education problem, but has actually intricately formed a social problem. If we do not rectify the source from a political perspective and place the economic structure on a stable cornerstone, then this phenomenon may just be in full swing!</p>

<h3 id="e272">In Memory of Mr. Shi Liangcai <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— By Xu Zhi</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Liangcai was shot and killed by thugs on the afternoon of the 13th of last month on his way from Hangzhou to Shanghai. This shocking and unfortunate news has already spread throughout China and abroad, shaking the hearts of the general public. Although nearly a month has passed, there is still no news of the case being solved. At the same time, people from all walks of life in Shanghai, deeply saddened by Mr. Shi's tragic misfortune, will hold a grand memorial service for Mr. Shi to express their condolences. In this situation, I really don't know what words to use to express the grief and indignation in my heart regarding Mr. Shi's misfortune!</p>
<p>Mr. Shi was the general manager of this newspaper. He took over the "Shen Bao" after the founding of the Republic of China. The fact that the "Shen Bao's" business has been able to develop more and more and is in its current state can be said to be entirely the result of Mr. Shi's unique talent and hard work in planning. Now, the "Shen Bao" sells more than 100,000 copies every day, and its various supplements are also loved by a wide range of readers. At the same time, the various subsidiary businesses established under the "Shen Bao" Newspaper, such as the amateur tutoring school, the circulating library, the yearbook, the monthly magazine, etc., have made undeniable contributions to Chinese culture and Chinese society. Although it cannot be said that all these undertakings are entirely the achievement of Mr. Shi Liangcai alone, there is no doubt that Mr. Shi was the main driving force for realizing them. Now, the various cultural undertakings of the "Shen Bao" Newspaper are developing, but Mr. Shi Liangcai, the main driving force for these undertakings, has unfortunately passed away. This is not only a loss for the "Shen Bao" Newspaper, but also a major loss for the Chinese cultural world!</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Shi Liangcai not only worked hard in cultural undertakings, but also actively promoted general social undertakings. For example, he and Mr. Huang Yizhu founded the "Zhongnan Bank," he and Mr. Xiang Songmao founded the "Wuzhou Pharmacy," he and Mr. Lu Feibohong founded the "Zhonghua Book Company," and he founded the "Minsheng Yarn Factory," etc., all of which have brought great benefits to Chinese society. During the "January 28th Incident," the entire Shanghai was in a very dangerous state of turmoil, and most compatriots were panicking all day long, not knowing what to do. At this time, Mr. Shi came forward to initiate the establishment of the "Shanghai Local Maintenance Association" to deal with everything. Therefore, when it was changed to the "Local Coordination Association," Mr. Shi was still appointed as the chairman. In addition, Mr. Shi held many positions, such as the Speaker of the Municipal Council, the Director of the China Merchants Group, the Honorary Chairman of the Red Cross Society, and the Director of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center. These are all very important positions that have a great relationship with Chinese society. Therefore, Mr. Shi's misfortune is not only a loss for the Chinese cultural world, but also a huge loss for the entire Chinese society! Not only people in the Chinese cultural world feel deep sadness about this, but the general public also feels very grief-stricken!</p>
<p>Now, the date of the Shanghai people's memorial service for Mr. Shi is approaching. In this time of universal mourning and heart-wrenching sights, in addition to hoping that the government will solve this case as soon as possible, and hoping that the people of society and the working masses will continue Mr. Shi's spirit and work hard in cultural and general social work, the editor has written this article to commemorate Mr. Shi, not only to express mourning.</p>

<p>Not having a clear understanding is always a fact. I am not complaining about people writing to me, but at least the people who write should carefully consider what meaning there is in writing this kind of letter.</p>
<p>Alright, I have said everything about my public and private life here. In the future, people who care about me can save some postage stamps and the energy they spend, and transfer it to the development of their own careers!</p>

<h3 id="e273">A Method of Selling <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Le Sheng</p>
<p>Selling is an art. Some salespeople can use methods that make buyers willingly purchase goods. Others not only fail to attract customers but also drive away those interested in the goods because of their ignorance of selling techniques. This difference is naturally due to the salesperson's skill.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many selling techniques, which can be utilized according to each individual's intelligence. However, there is one extremely fundamental and common selling technique that I want to discuss here, which all salespeople must be familiar with and pay great attention to. This is a selling technique based on the psychological principle of "Repetition." The "Repetition" principle is as follows: "Appropriate repetition of a certain phenomenon can arouse greater interest and attention in people." For example, if there are five advertisements, their effectiveness when posted in five different locations is often less than when posted in one location because a single poster often fails to arouse people's interest and attention. We often see that "posters" for Peking opera houses and movie theaters on the street are always pasted together in multiple copies; this is the same principle. There are many such examples in personal matters as well. We often have the experience that when we want to go to a certain place two or three miles away, we don't have a definite idea about whether to take a rickshaw or not. If at this time, many rickshaw pullers suddenly come one after another to solicit business, we might end up taking one of the later ones. "Life's major events" can often achieve satisfactory results due to continuous "pursuit" over and over again. The principle of selling is the same. When a customer arrives, needless to say, you must pleasantly take out the goods and ask them to inspect them. You must not be afraid of trouble, offering your goods to them once, twice, three times, four times... Only attentive service can persuade the buyer and win their favor. You must be like a rickshaw puller grabbing business or a young man pursuing a partner, persevering and not missing your opportunity to advance. Even a customer who is not very interested in the goods may be conquered by your attentiveness, and they will definitely choose an item to buy. (The last item presented often has a higher chance of being chosen.)</p>
<p>Many people have succeeded in selling by applying this "repetition" principle of once, twice, and thrice. In our country, salespeople in North China understand this principle better than those in Central and South China. In North China, more reputable shops, such as fabric stores, silver shops, and jewelry stores, will invite you to sit in a specially set-up reception room inside once you enter. Tea and cigarettes are offered, and the goods you want are brought one by one. Even if you are not satisfied, they will not blame you and will still politely send you out. Most smaller shops are also very polite and would never behave like the salespeople in some large shops in Shanghai, who show displeasure and impatience to customers who are not very interested in the goods, even scolding "pigs" or other insulting words. In fact, being polite to customers is absolutely necessary. You must know that offending one customer means losing one customer. How can people who rely on customers for food do something that is detrimental to themselves?</p>
<p>The Japanese are generally good at business and understand the tricks even better than the Chinese in the North. Their application of the "repetition" principle can be seen from their relentless approach to customers. No wonder Japanese merchants can be found in every corner of the world and succeed everywhere they go.</p>

<h3 id="e274">Criticism, Abuse, and Beautiful Writing <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>A fair critic "neither cries nor laughs" at the person or work he criticizes; he merely explains its correctness or errors and the reasons for them. Naturally, in his explanation, he may sometimes express respect or "rebuke" for the person or work he criticizes, but if his position is correct and his reasons are just and sufficient, then the resulting "respect" or "rebuke" is not "boosting" or "abuse," but objective truth.</p>
<p>However, abuse is never criticism; criticism is rational, while abuse is unreasonable! Recently, some people who write "critical articles" do not understand this principle. They don't want theory, they just scold others as "absurd" or "idiotic" without pointing out where their "absurdity" or "idiocy" lies; sometimes they even completely deviate from the issue being discussed and focus on making a big "deal" out of the person's surname or given name. Such "criticism" cannot be considered criticism; it is merely unreasonable abuse. If the study and debate of all academics and all issues must have theoretical content in order to advance research and debate and to bring us closer to the truth, then those gentlemen who replace criticism with abuse are objectively hindering the progress of research and debate and are therefore obscuring the truth.</p>
<p>Those gentlemen who replace criticism with abuse say that some people cannot be reasoned with. Reasoning with such people is actually like playing the lute to a cow, so you can only give them a good scolding--such an argument seems very heroic on the surface, but fundamentally, it is an expression of incompetence in deliberately avoiding the issue. Because critical writing is not only for the person being criticized but also mainly for the general readers. It not only needs to be shown to the person being criticized but also to the general readers. But what can make the person being criticized speechless and at a loss for words is correct theory, not "a good scolding." What general readers are exploring is even more correct theory, not some "art of scolding." So if anyone wants to replace criticism with abuse, no matter what their "reason" is, it is an expression of incompetence in failing to meet legitimate objective demands.</p>
<p>If this phenomenon of replacing criticism with abuse continues to develop, then not only will all research and debate be hindered, but criticism itself may be in danger of being eliminated. Think about it: if everyone thinks that it is right to replace criticism with abuse, and all those who write critical articles use various excuses to desperately show off their "talent" by blindly scolding the people they criticize, then will there still be criticism? Therefore, for the sake of the very life of criticism, we cannot agree with any reason for replacing criticism with abuse. We need to reveal the truth, and we demand theoretical criticism and debate!</p>
<p>Just as it is wrong to replace criticism with abuse, it is also wrong to only want to write a "beautiful article" with beautiful words and an unusual structure, regardless of whether the critical writing is theoretically correct or not. We know that words and writing are used to express our thoughts and feelings. There must first be a certain thought and feeling, and then there are words and writing suitable for expressing this thought and feeling; even aestheticism, which specializes in words and phrases, and Chinese parallel prose, which specializes in the splendor and antithesis of words, are produced under certain thoughts and feelings. Theory is a systematic combination of thoughts and feelings. Therefore, we must focus on theory when writing critical articles, with words being secondary--words are tools for expressing theory--and we cannot focus solely on the beauty of words, lest we fall into the pit of "harming the meaning with words." For example, when we want to criticize someone's theory, we must have our own theoretical system, and then find words suitable for expressing our opinions within this theoretical system to write a theoretical critical article. In the middle of this, even if there are many beautiful words, witty scolding, and profound classical references, if they are not suitable for expressing our theory, then they should be discarded; otherwise, we will make the mistake of "harming the meaning with words." Naturally, when we express our own theory, we must pay attention to the beauty and power of words and the structure of the text, because if we can express our opinions with the most vivid words and the most perfect writing method, then the effect on theory will inevitably be great. However, this is also a question of how to better express our theory, not a meaning that focuses on scrutinizing words; if you don't do it this way, and you must write "critical articles" for the sake of beautiful words and witty scolding, then no matter how much comfort you get in your personal heart, no matter how you boast about the "wittiness" and "beauty" of your article, in the end, general readers will say that you are "showy but unsubstantial," shallow, and boring!</p>
<p>To be honest, so-called beautiful writing is produced under progressive theory. If you don't grasp progressive theory, then you won't be able to write truly beautiful writing; what you can write is only empty or tasteless absurd writing. If you don't believe it, please write an article centered on supporting the theory of imperialists and see what happens. No matter how good you are at writing, I dare say that the result will inevitably be full of ugliness!</p>
<p>In short, we need theoretical criticism, not abuse, and we don't need "showy but unsubstantial" beautiful writing.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3 id="e276">The Shen Bao Circulation Library, Amateur Tutoring School, and Women's Tutoring School Commemorate Mr. Shi Liangcai <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shi Liangcai was assassinated on November 13, 1934, on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway in broad daylight. Besides grief, what else can we say about this case? But Mr. Shi’s death cannot be regarded as an ordinary farewell, saying a few words of mourning like everyone else.</p>
<p>We commemorate and admire Mr. Shi because he was not only the sole leader of the Chinese press but also the sole mentor of Chinese mass education. If Mr. Shi had not prioritized the interests of the masses, Shen Bao would not have its long and glorious history today; if Mr. Shi had not aimed to educate the masses, he would not have established social education undertakings in addition to the newspaper business itself. Therefore, we have to commemorate such a great man, our mentor.</p>
<p>We commemorate and admire Mr. Shi because we know that he came from the masses and understood the sufferings of the people. The Shen Bao Circulation Library, the Amateur Tutoring School, and the Women's Tutoring School were all built on this understanding and became important works of Shen Bao's social education. Therefore, we commemorate this great man, our mentor.</p>
<p>We mourn for Mr. Shi's untimely death, for his sacrifice for social undertakings, which prevented him from dedicating his great aspirations to society to the fullest extent and from serving the disaster-ridden country. We cannot help but mourn the loss of the essence of the country and society!</p>
<p>We commemorate Mr. Shi and mourn him because of his great personality and the most important significance of sacrificing for society. Therefore, we want to commemorate Mr. Shi, not focusing on perfunctory formalities but on another meaning of inheriting his legacy.</p>
<p>Continued on Page 5</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Stop the lamentation! Stop the wailing! Stop the tears! All are useless! What we need is to actively inherit Mr. Shi's great aspirations, tread the path he has opened, and move forward!</p>
<p>Students who are directly or indirectly related to Shen Bao's social education! The vast readers of the Shen Bao Circulation Library! Do you want to say a final goodbye to Mr. Shi? Are you willing to express your admiration and sorrow before Mr. Shi's image?</p>
<p>Therefore, we students and colleagues who assisted Mr. Shi's education undertakings have initiated this memorial service. The date is set for December 10 (Monday), to be held at the "Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association."</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that all students and the vast readers of the Shen Bao Circulation Library will participate individually at that time.</p>
<p>At the same time, we will also accept literary elegies commemorating Mr. Shi and other souvenirs. We also plan to compile all the writings into a book as a major commemoration. If you have these items, please send them to the Shen Bao Circulation Library at 345 Nanjing Road Continental Department Store or the Shen Bao Women's Tutoring School at 75 Xieqiaonong, Jing'an Temple Road, before December 9.</p>
<p>We do not emphasize form in our commemoration, but at the same time, we cannot do without form! But what we pay special attention to is the meaning of our commemoration, hoping that all those who are prepared to participate in the conference will pay their respects to Mr. Shi with a solemn meaning! To explain their aspirations! To continue Mr. Shi's unfinished business.</p>
<p>We hope that all students who are directly or indirectly related to Shen Bao and the vast readers of the Shen Bao Circulation Library will mobilize to participate in Mr. Shi's memorial service!</p>

<p>— Su Gang</p>
<p>It's indeed not an easy task for a large boat of more than 60 feet to turn around in this shallow and narrow Gan River. More than thirty boatmen were tightly gripping their punting poles and pushing. Steam like steamed buns was rising from their heads, the veins on their foreheads bulging like earthworms, and sweat poured down from their heads like water from a mountain stream. The boat owner stood in front of the awning mast, constantly shouting, "Come on! One more punt on this side. Good, swing left!"</p>
<p>He held a four-foot-long smoking pipe in his hand and shouted energetically, sometimes directing the sailors in front and sometimes shouting at the helmsman in the back, his hands and mouth never stopping for a moment. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw his face. I quickly walked over and shouted to him, "Boss!"</p>
<p>He was caught off guard by my sudden shout, and his body swayed. He turned around, saw that it was me, and quickly put on a smile, saying, "You!"</p>
<p>"I think you're working even harder than them! I've been watching you for a long time, and your hands and mouth haven't stopped for a moment!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" He pulled the smoking pipe out of his mouth, sighed, and then said with a smile, "Don't you know the hardship of earning a living? This boat is my family's property, and everyone depends on it for food and drink. If we don't move for a day, we don't eat for a day. If we accidentally hit a hole, it's terrible! They don't care about these things. If the boat breaks down and can't move, they can go to another boat." (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening "Lamenting the Lotus"</p>
<p>The scorching sun brightly illuminates the lotus pond. Tall and graceful, they resemble the Sixth Son. Everyone envies their complete attire of silk. The fluttering dragonflies busily carry fragrance. Deep affection binds the mandarin duck companions. A bitten-arm oath ensures the longevity of their bond, as enduring as the sun and moon. I remember his翩翩 graceful demeanor, like He Lang's appearance. I remember her 綽約 captivating beauty, proud in her waterside village. Leisurely talk praises the enchanting beauty of immortals, with twin blossoms spreading fragrance throughout the world. Alas, temporary joy is difficult to sustain. In an instant, the autumn wind brings a distinct chill. Light silk sleeves are deemed too thin. The opportunistic mandarin ducks no longer behave with decorum. I recall the days when, in emerald sleeves, she rode freely in the wind, once recording her surname to inform Wang Chang. Now, as summer ends and autumn arrives, things are not as desired. Even those withered branches and decaying leaves emit no pleasant fragrance. The fickleness of the world is truly hateful. Looking back, the past is but a dream. I advise the world, do not say that the heat of summer is easily endured. When the autumn chill arrives, you will personally taste the bitter and辛辛 flavors. I lament the lotus flower while also satirizing the world. It is not an intentional insult to the Sixth Son. Like Song Yu, I grieve for autumn out of personal sorrow.</p>

<p>Wu Song's nature is fierce and resolute. In a moment, he raises his knife without hesitation. Startled, the neighbors come to dissuade him. Elder Chen explains the details carefully. The hero fears not the laws of the imperial court. With his knife, he kills Jin Lian, ending her life. I say to you respected neighbors, do not be alarmed. Wu Er takes responsibility for his actions alone. He runs through the streets with his knife in an instant, all because Xi Menqing is too wicked. Those who commit adultery with women will not have a good end. He coincidentally encounters Xi Menqing at the tavern. Truly, it is a dragon and tiger fight in the streets. Wu Dalang secretly comes to help. He cleaves Xi Menqing with his knife, ending his life. He goes to the public court to strike the drum. The county magistrate immediately ascends the bench. Mother Wang confesses to her schemes. He scrutinizes the wicked plot and reveals the details. Captain Chao is sentenced to banishment.</p>

<p>"Man Jiang Hong"</p>
<p>Li Taozhi and Miss Qin talked for a long time. Li Taozhi still wanted to go to Qingliang Mountain, so she borrowed Qin Xiaoxiang's bicycle and rode to Qingliang Mountain. But when she arrived at Qingliang Mountain, she didn't see anyone. She only heard Yu Shuicun and Han Qiu talking in the house, knowing that Liang Qiushan was sick. Mo Xinye was going to perform "Manteb" on stage to sell tickets to help with Qiushan's medical expenses. Taozhi hurried back to Qin Xiaoxiang's house and asked her to go with her to see Mo Xinye perform. So the two went to Liu Chao Ju to ask Boss Jin for leave.</p>

<p>Ms. Wang Bingmei's Tang Poetry</p>
<p>Huaxing (1260) 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM</p>
<p>Number Three</p>
<p>Countless mountains and valleys flock to Jingmen, the birthplace of Lady Zhaojun still has a village.</p>
<p>Once gone from the purple terraces to the northern desert, only a green tomb remains facing the twilight.</p>
<p>In paintings, one recognizes her spring breeze face, her jade pendants must return on a moonlit night as a spirit.</p>
<p>For a thousand years, the pipa has played a barbarian tune, clearly conveying resentment in its melodies.</p>
<p>Number Four</p>
<p>The Shu ruler campaigned against Wu, traveling through the Three Gorges, and died in Yong'an Palace in a year of collapse.</p>
<p>Imagining his jade carriage amidst the empty mountains, the jade palace is empty within the wild temple.</p>
<p>Ancient temple cedars and pines are nesting places for water herons, villagers walk by to perform sacrifices every year and season.</p>
<p>The Temple of Marquis Wu is nearby, ruler and minister are worshiped together as one.</p>
<p>Number Five</p>
<p>Zhuge's great name echoes through the universe, the loyal minister's image is solemn and lofty.</p>
<p>His strategic planning divided the land into three, his feather fan has lasted through ten thousand ages of clouds and skies.</p>
<p>Between Bo Zhong, one sees Yi Yin and Lü Shang, his command was decisive, eclipsing Xiao He and Cao Shen.</p>
<p>The fate of the Han Dynasty was ultimately difficult to restore, his resolve was to sacrifice himself to relieve the army's labors.</p>
<p>Parting from Xue Liu and Liu Ba, Two Officials, Again in Jiangzhou  Liu Changqing</p>
<p>I never expected to receive a gracious imperial decree, I idly learned drunken songs, knowing nothing of worldly affairs.</p>
<p>The moon is bright over the river, wild geese fly past, the trees fall in Huainan, and there are many Chu mountains.</p>
<p>I am happy to live near the waterside, but I am sad to see my white hair.</p>
<p>Today, we are both old and decrepit, I am ashamed that you still care about the treacherous waves.</p>
