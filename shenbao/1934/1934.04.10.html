<p>— 貞</p>
<p>近日華北局勢。據日來平電所傳。危機又漸暴露。一則馬蘭峪之接收。已無形停頓。而日本預備役軍官百餘人。分赴冀魯察綏考察。名爲遊歷。實際其用意何居。難以推測。同時馬蘭峪又到大批日機。而戰區（卽津東薊北一帶）行軍演習。尤足令人驚詫。再則日機飛翔察東。隨處窺探。似爲軍事行動之先聲。而僞軍李守信所部。又駐紥沽源境內。隨時有挑衅之可能。再次則唐山工潮。迄今仍遷延未决。就一方面觀察。固爲勞資糾紛。不必果含有若何政治意味。然領導此次運動之李大中。卽非工人。又有槍械。其中暗幕。安知其不别具作用。上述數者。僅舉其複雜情勢中主要問題之一端。而推究其危機所伏。在在可以牽一髮而動全身。使華北陷於悲境。誠如某要人所談今後在外交上苟再無整個具體的方略以應付之者。則前途之隱憂將不知伊於何底也　　外交須以國力爲後盾。中央政府注意於自己實力之充實。所謂「攘外必先安內。」卽此意也。現在禍機較九一八事變後熱河失守以前。尤爲急迫。蓋彼時世界各國經濟主義尙未積極施行。對日關係亦未至如現在之緊張。國際間對我。猶表示道德上之同情。祇須我能切實凖備。尙有若干轉旋之餘地。頃則國際間之外交運用。已轉回一九一四年前之狀態。在遠東方面情勢爲尤甚。我國處此急難之中。將何以自免於危亡。更何以圖民族之復興。能容我再事蹉跎。而不急加注意乎。</p>
<p>安內之道。首在民生。中山先生遺敎。早有明訓。今日中國國民經濟。已整個趨於破敗之途。卽以上海市面論。自本年春季以來。已表現其深刻之恐慌。足徵我國民經濟前途之危。卽無外患。亦十分可慮。故今日對內而欲求確實之安定。在國民經濟上尤不能不加以十倍之努力。夫我國工業落後。已無可諱而農村之衰頹如是。亦已失其農業立國之依據。現時謀挽回頹勢。首應注意如何增加農業生產。如何提高農民消費。蓋我國農民生活水凖。已低至無可再低。减至無可再减。所謂戒除奢侈之習。力事節約之舉。在都市中固應努力。而在農村中一般平民。方將設法獎勵其生活之提高也。不過現時農村。穀價卽賤。副業又衰。經濟週轉。幾陷絕滅之境。如河南四川陜西甘肅等省。鄕間一元之微。亦視同異寳。當地所發行之非法紙幣。充塞市面。農民之感受困苦。實難縷述。故今後宜迅速施行信用合作。使農村經濟。得有週轉餘地。然後再求生產與消費之平衡。　　農村經濟。如確有恢復之機運以後。新工業之建設乃始有明確之出路。如鐵道之建築。紡織物品之消塲。及其他交通工業之推進。表面觀察。似皆屬於工業振興範圍以內。以實則莫不以農業爲基礎。今日自給自足經濟盛倡之時。本國工業之原料。更須取給於本國也。至於國防凖備。一切軍事一設施。與軍需品之供給。大都有待於農業中食糧品及原料之供應。而軍械固需工業基礎之健實。然亦必有賴於經濟之充裕。始可以應付國際之變局。以目前國際危機之迫切。而猶從容談經濟。談軍事凖備。毌乃太迂緩乎。然須知我國現勢。如不能打破經濟上之難關。不從農業與工業奠定基礎。則國防建設終屬空言。迂緩之圖。究是根本之至計也。</p>

<p>德國通信</p>
<p>三位獨裁首相、意大利的墨索里尼、奧大利的杜爾斐斯、匈牙利的貢巴斯、會晤於羅馬、這是全歐震撼的事、因爲奧匈兩國、屈服於所謂聖傑門與特利安龍和平條約之下、受大國的支配、無論在政治上在經濟上都似乎没有出路、並且可以說找不到出路、本來奧國的形勢、　和人種關係、都以與德國合併爲最相宜、一則因爲國社黨舉動、過於魯莽、失去了奧國大部分的人心、二則是意大利怕德奧合併之後、德意志將由六千五百萬人口的國家、一躍而升至七千二百萬人、與意大利以一大威脅、加以德國的科學技術、不是她們的對手、這一點·不特意大利警戒、卽法國也是很注意戒備的、果然·德奧合併的話、法國就運用諸種和平條約作武器來反對、卽意圖拉攏奧匈、法國也是要從中破壞的、不過在制限德國發展這一點上、是相同的、所以也就默認意奧匈三國的舉動、而不立刻加以積極的牽制、德國這時候、如果得不到政治上的切實援助、她是不至輕舉妄動的、</p>
<p>何况在經濟方面、她還有內在的弱點、例如失業問題、自國社黨去年一月執政以來、改善失業狀態、是她最主要的主張、自那時以後、據勞工介紹所的調查、去年二月底失業工人數爲六百零一萬四千餘人、其後遂逐漸减少、不過那種减少、是含有極濃重的季節關係、因爲到了夏天、避暑及其他臨時事業興起之後、總有不少的工人、要吸引到工作中去、到去年十二月、却又增加起來了、究竟德國的失業狀况、是否改善了呢、照德意志景氣研究所的報吿、一九三一年春季到秋季没有登記的失業工人、有一百五十萬、現在没有登記的失業者却有二百萬了、去年冬季的失業工人、與前年冬季相比較减少了一百六十四萬餘人、而新就工作的人、在同時期內、祇增加一百三十二萬一千餘人、現在將德國工人就工作的情形、與失業狀况、據德國景氣研究所的統計、抄表如下、</p>

<p>一九三三　　　一九三二　　　　　　年十一月　　　年十一月就工作人數　一四·○二○　一二·六九九失業登記人數　三·七一五　　五·三五五這裏面至少還要加進五十萬以至六十萬、没有登記的失業工人、則德國政府拼命努力、究竟可以得到怎樣的結果、或者是春去夏來之後、照例又有季節的好轉換了、</p>
<p>再則德意志對國際的收支、並没有海外投資、卽海運收入、也極有限、幾乎算不得什麼、所以她祇好單靠貿易上的輸出超過來彌補了、但是自今年開年以來、一月與二月對外貿易、都突轉爲輸入超過、如本年二月與去年二月相比較、輸入則由七萬一千五百萬馬克、增加到七萬五千九百萬馬克、而輸出則由七萬六千四百萬馬克、减到六萬九千三百萬馬克、是則由四千九百萬馬克的輸出超過、轉而爲六千六百萬馬克輸入超過了、這是何等的危險事、德政府爲此曾在二月中决定管理對外匯兌、要輸入物品的購買不得超過輸出的百分之五十、三月又决定爲百分之四十五了、并且德意志銀行的兌換劵現金凖備、祇有二萬六千二百萬馬克、對三十三萬萬兌換劵、祇有百分之八的凖備率、德國當前的經濟維關、也正不下於她的外交苦境、（一九三四年三月九日於柏林）</p>

<p>春秋御香缥缈録  秦瘦鷗譯　　（二）太后下詔備火車　　近來太后的脾氣似乎已變得很歡喜動的樣子。我想，也許伊是受了上回那一次熱河之行的影響。在没有到熱河去之前，伊的足跡所至，總是跳不出紫金城和頤和園這爾個地方。雖然在庚子拳匪之亂的時候，伊曾經到西安去過一次，然而那是迫不得已逃難，當然不能算是出遊。這幾十年來，可眞把伊關閉得悶透了；而宮中的那些朝參大典，以及每天和伊的臣下們集議軍國大事的早朝，也不免使伊覺得有些厭倦了。且不管伊究竟是爲了什麼緣故，總之，伊是很熱烈地在希望過一些不同的生活。我又想我平時對於我自己的種族丨滿洲人，所加的種種神秘的猜測，或許也是使伊打算出遊的動機之一。因此，後來很有人在議論我丨雖然並不會明白的指定丨是攛掇太后往奉天去的罪魁。但是依事實而論，自從我們滿洲人的祖先在西歷一六四四年入關以來，滿洲人只有一天一天的進來，很少再回去的，所以也無怪我和我的妹妹對於我們自己的本鄕，都是這樣的懷念着，希罕着了。　　後來，皇太后是决意要上奉天去走一遭了。順便還想看看東陵的那些古宮。當然，伊的主意一經决定之後，便等於是已經實行的一樣了，立刻就有電報打到奉天去，知照那裏的人，凖備一切。雖然那邊的宮院也像熱河行宮一般的常川有人看守着，可是在太后未啓程以前，北京方面又另派了許多人去，目的是要把那幾座久已空閉着的宮殿，點綴得像紫禁城和頤和園一般的華貴舒適。（七）人獸之間  定華　　在今日的社會上，「猪玀」，「狐狸精」，「兎崽子」等，早已成爲極普通的罵人名詞。其它像悍婦對於丈夫的呌罵稱謂「河東獅吼」，舉動野蠻呌「獸性勃發」，難能滿足的慾望稱「獸慾」，連不合倫常的性交也稱「獸交」。好像人世間一切乖謬反常的舉動都是屬於獸類似的。其實獸類之中像馬的忠誠，羊的孝順，虎的節，狗的義，這都是不可抺殺的事實。其他像狗和猫的受了豢養，就會一絲不苟的替主人防賊捕鼠。至於牛的勤於操作，猪和兎的多產，這是萬物之靈」所難能比上的。並且老虎的吃人，據說也有一半是人的倀鬼做嚮導的。　　中國歷史上有過許多屬於「萬物之靈」的英雄和好漢，到現在還在受人敬仰。但是關羽的「赤兎」項羽的「烏騅」等，照樣也能名垂千古。並且據說薛仁貴的征東，完全靠了「坐騎」的跨海，康王的逃歸，也少不了「泥馬」䭾渡的功勞。　　就拿前幾年上海幾處屬於工部局管轄的公園前面豎着的路牌來說吧，丨「華人與狗不准入內」，號稱「萬物之靈」的中國人比獸類也就便宜不了多少。秩序與生活  孫育才　　秩序二字之不爲吾人所注意，實甚於晚近吾人之對於禮義廉恥。由於對秩序之漠視，不知虛耗了吾人多少寳貴的時間與多少寳貴的事業。　　卽以吾人平常之起居飲食而論，很少有人營着有秩序有規律的生活。當一個寄宿在校中的學生暑假中回去度過其家庭生活時，最感不適的就是飲食起居的或早或遲，因此而影響其健康生活的，比比皆是。　　有許多很重要而且很簡便的日常工作，往往因爲生活的無秩序不能履行，例如每天五六分鐘健康生活的太極操，十分鐘的日記，就很少有人能日日遵守，結果總是虎頭蛇尾，徹然中斷。　　很多技能學得，往往是秩序二字的賜予，並不是經過多大的困難，我有個朋友，他的音樂專家的頭銜，就是成功於有秩序之生活，因爲他從前連五綫譜都不識，但是在過去十年中，每日下午的八時至十時，他從没有放棄他的音樂學習，至於星期天，他却是有計劃的遊玩。作家張夢麟先生，在其書中的第一章中說：「拿一個鐘頭（指每日）來學每一個字的發音，和這一個字的簡單意義，那麼，只消一個月時間，便可以讀完這一張表了。」秩序之對於吾人學術之學習，是如何的重要？　　吾人每每恨着工作太忙，光陰太快，但是吾人却不能有計劃的去利用光陰，有秩序的去從事式作，自無怪於要感到「流水年華」「一生是忙」了。目逆而送之背影  花鈴　　閒着没事幹，上街去散一會子步。散步，自然得東張西望，瞧這個，瞧那個。一眼見了有一位娘兒，說得時代化些兒，一位摩登女子，在前面扭着腰肢兒走，因爲脚上是穿的小方跟的高跟鞋，所以走起路來，臀部的顫動，顯示着站在時代前面的肉感。　　任誰碰到了這樣的一個塲合，假使不是六根已凈的柳下惠，魯男子，總不免要脚裏明白，加速了步子，亦步亦趨的跟着送一程，雖然心裏明知自己與這女子。以前旣無一面之交，將來也斷不會有半面之雅。揭開天窗說亮話，便不過是多端詳一會子背影，多咽幾口兒饞涎，所謂望梅止渴而已。　　心平些的，這麼瞧了一陣子背影，也就算了。不知足的，在背後瞧了一個够，終以未得一見下面的花容月貌爲憾，於是也顧不得自己的氣急哮喘病，竟三步併作了二步，擠到那位娘兒的前面去，再掉頭來，狠狠地釘上二三眼。　　不看下面猶可，看了正面，往往會得後悔不止，而連連唾掉二三口的涎沬，因爲有些背影苗條得使人見了魂也消的娘兒們，臉上却是一版黑大麻，無數肉疙瘩，缺嘴，塌鼻，掃帚眉，或是羊白眼。就是没有甚麼天然缺憾的，那麼，天下没有十全十美的婦人，那副儀表，或許還比家裏孩子的媽較遜些，也說不定。　　似這般可喜娘罕曾見，讓伊一世把背影給我們瞧罷。若是伊眞的回過儉兒來，恐怕就有些兒不敢領敎。人生一切，都當作如是觀。拉雑話歙硯的研究（二）（十）  無聊客　　▲歙硯槪况　　（六）石瑕種種　歙石最上等之硯材，亦多瑕疵，惟其石工善於雕琢，作種種花樣以掩飾之，遂不之見耳。名材而完全無瑕疵者，最爲難得。　　玉帶紋在端石，本列爲石疵之一，後因其紋美麗，且甚稀少，愛硯家遂改變眼光，而稱爲美紋。歙之玉帶紋，亦同一觀感，其所分别者，端之玉帶，於白色中稍帶靑色，歙之玉帶，則瑩潔純白，惟此等瑩潔純白之紋，唐宋時舊坑乃有之，確爲上品。至明淸以後，率皆粗礪暗晦，不足觀，謂爲石疵可也。又有一種豆斑紋，如於龍尾黑石中現淡靑白色之斑點，亦殊美觀，可寳貴，若其他坑石所出類是之斑點，粗黄幹燥，不足觀矣。　　至其他顯然之石瑕，寳足爲佳硯之累，略舉如下：　　鷄脚　　黑黯如鷄爪頗礙墨　　烏豚　　亦曰烏肫皺文若肉胜　　隔路　　若矧跡色黄黑硬滑　　黑色贅子　　如黑豆狀甚礙磨墨　　擔線斜紋　　如端之水線現斷裂紋　　硬線　　如鐵線石疵中最劣　　塵孔　　有微細之孔如猪鬃孔　　黄爛　　含有土氣之黄色瘢點　　（七）研究歙硯之困難　自文藝界重端輕歙以後，研究歙硯者亦隨以日少，輕歙的原因，一方由於愛硯家一時嗜好風尙的轉移，一方亦由於歙的名材旣少，雜石的混冒又多，眞僞很難辨别。如黟縣有靑黑石堅潤有聲，亦有金釘，但多瑕，工人卽以冒充龍尾金星，祁門石之細者似泥漿坑羅紋，但太柔軟易幹，工人卽以冒充泥漿羅紋，玉山童家坊之石，色亦淡靑，羅紋眉子俱備，但久磨卽不發墨，工人卽以冒充眉子坑之眉子紋石，常山石種類尤多，色則靑綠紫不一，石工往往細加雕刻，冒爲各種歙縣名材，如此之類，僞品甚多。曹善祥曾經說過的；非特日人一律視作寳硯，重價收買，卽中國士大夫，亦重視之而愛報珍藏，蓋此種僞品，流傳已久，外表觀之，頗覺古色古香，故最易淆亂耳目，令人受欺，而矯枉過正者，則又一槪視爲不可靠，而摒不顧問，此歙硯之所以日漸被輕視，而研究之所以無人也。然其實，苟石理堅細瑩潤，玉質金聲，光澤而發墨者必爲佳品，持此以研究歙硯，必無一失。東北四連長  張恨水　　第二七回　閨怨暗中消慈懷可感　閒愁醉後起舊事難忘　　積之那個人是很好的，儘管有作大事的心胸，表示可是十分斯文，假使我現在嫁人是他，一定是日夜成雙作對，他少不得還要帶我到各處去玩呢。唉！自己一時之錯，他想到這裏，失聲將那口氣歎了出來，同時身子斜靠椅子坐定，這時也就扭了一扭。就在這時，卜篤一下嚮，一樣東西打在腦袋上。拿起來看時，却是趙自强的一張半身相片。自己偷偷的在想着情人，丈夫的相片，會跳下來打我一下，還不有些怪嗎？莫不是他？：想到這裏，毛骨悚然起來，趕快把相片放在桌上，自己嚇的倒退了幾步。但是偷眼看自强的相片時，依然笑嘻的。於是站着出了一會神，再看看墻上掛相片的所在。這就不由得點了兩點頭道：是了，這是我的錯誤。昨晚那樣夜深，曾把這張相片拿下來看看的，後來母親來了，就隨手把相片掛上，至於把相片掛好没有，倒是没有注意。剛才自己一動，椅子碰着壁，把相片碰下來，這是自然的道理，有什麼奇怪？於是拿着相片，又坐下來看着。自己點着頭道：這是我不應該的事。丈夫雖然别我走了，這不是他故意的，他幹的是替國家守邊界的事，職分要這樣的。我不願丈夫這樣，壓根兒，就不該嫁他。認定人家是軍人嫁過來，就得安分作軍官的媳婦，這還有什麼可說的？丈夫出征去了，媳婦就在家裏變心，這不更呌軍人寒心嗎？桂枝如此想着時，緊緊的皺了眉頭，牙齒咬着嘴唇，留下很深的牙印去。兩手緊緊的捧了那張相片，眼光直射着自强的影子。（三五八）</p>

<p>— 查理士</p>
<p>東方文化大槪經過了淑世主義的薰習，遇事遇物必加以倫理的解釋，而增添敎育的臭味，因此忽略生劎之眞如實境，換言之，卽將生命磨壞了，摧毁了。大家在卑下的敎制中，度了兩千年的歲月。</p>
<p>餘是凡有軌道破壞者，現狀改革者，皆成功了狂人，天才，隱逸者流。佛敎不以人類爲中心，憧憬於另外一世界，却將阿鼻地獄遺傳給現世人，俗人，正是大的反叛思想，革命思想。慈悲是一種極力的武器，不抵抗其實是最大的抵抗，仁愛往往爲最大的復仇！</p>
<p>譬如以眼還眼，牙還牙，這實是最簡單之事。倘若雖是仇敵，而能寬恕他，包涵他，感化他，則仇敵反得到最大的痛苦。因爲只要是人，則必有人的感覺，也必有良知良能。希臘人最懂到這些，所以那神話中所描寫地獄的苦刑，並非刀山劍樹，而是一種簡單底「天良」的鞭笞！在生命上的毒楚，這也就勝過一切的一刑罰！</p>
<p>佛說佛力調伏獅象，降龍馭虎，其實是最好的寓言！</p>
<p>冷血的人們，毒焰薰天，並仁義而竊取之，爲大奸　，幾乎要使地上寸草不生了，歷史上眞是太多，然一遇慈悲，便烟消雲散。好像可以力敵萬夫，而不能當孺子微微一笑。人力固有限而意固無窮？封神傳中講多少妖魔鬼怪的法寳一遇如來的洶輝，便碎爲微璧，雖係憒世之談，也的確是看空了人世的鬼崇，覺得不算什麼，而作。</p>
<p>雖然，這要成爲一種空談的精神勝利了，其實也不然。惟有慈悲的報復，才算勝利的報復，也是永久的克服。精神上不先勝利，物質上决不會勝利的。生命的如實境，　融湛寂，如太空之光輝，這兒充滿慈悲和喜悅，至者一些黑暗，惡毒，偶一遇之，便要無影無踪，遭豈不是最大的報復？</p>

<p>— 樂寳</p>
<p>「六軍不發無奈何宛轉娥眉馬前死」讓我同皇上說一句話吧！」</p>
<p>女人睜大了細長的眼睛，向左右射着可怕的光芒。於是，拉她的武士，都不覺地自動退了一步。她便把拖在地上的紅綢裙子一提，驕傲的臉子一仰，直衝到駕著三匹駿馬的車前，剛要開口說：</p>
<p>「萬歲呵，你怎麼讓他們這樣行凶？」</p>
<p>但一眼看見車中坐着的皇帝，臉色已經慘變了，吊在黄袍胸襟上面的灰白鬍鬚，正不住地顫抖着，（這是她從來不曾看過而且也没有想到的。）就生氣地頓足道：</p>
<p>「老頭子，你簡直忘記你是個皇帝哪！快拿出做皇帝的威風來！」</p>
<p>皇帝看見妃子還這麼英勇，同時四下的喊聲又已停息，便突然本能地怒呌起來：</p>
<p>「是呀，我簡直忘記了！：：刀斧手，把搗亂的家伙，給我抓來！：：你同我一車好了！」</p>
<p>女人就作勢要爬上車去，皇帝也伸出手來援引，但四面的人聲，却馬上鼓噪起來，比先前呌的更見凶猛，更見可怕。同時一個全身武裝的將軍，慌忙走到車前，急促地說道：　　「萬萬：：萬歲！革命已來到馬前了！快：：快：：」</p>
<p>皇帝就對將軍劈頭罵道：</p>
<p>「我不怕！我不怕！看他們有胆量弄死一個皇帝！」</p>
<p>將車俯下身子惶恐地說：</p>
<p>「萬歲！這不比在宮殿上呵！」</p>
<p>「難道皇帝在野外就不値半文錢嗎？」</p>
<p>皇帝簡直咆哮起來了。將軍心裏却好氣，但只是囁嚅地說：</p>
<p>「聽呀，再這一點，我們大家都没命了？還講什麼値錢不値錢！」</p>
<p>女人依在車邊，一面頓足地哭泣，一面大聲地抱怨：</p>
<p>「嫁一個倒楣的莊稼漢，也比你有出息哪，也比你强哪！」</p>
<p>皇帝對這刺心的話，很是氣惱，又聽見越加猛烈的吼呌中，竟然有若一兩聲「打殺昏居」的呐喊，便向投軍突然唱道：</p>
<p>「那末，你快對他們宣佈我的聖旨，把她就地絞殺，不得遲延！」</p>
<p>聖旨宣佈出去，呐喊的聲音，立卽停止了。</p>
<p>女人掙扎在武士的手中，翻過氣靑了美麗的臉來，咬着嘴唇罵了一句：</p>
<p>「從前在長生殿說的話全是哄鬼呀！」</p>
<p>皇帝緊緊地閉住了眼睛，熱淚便從兩邊眼角湧了出來。</p>

<p>三萬六千頃的烟水，是你生利的工塲。乘一葉扁舟，撤開去，把大的羅綱；看着湖水的波動，帶着你無限希望。從日落到月落，從童稚到年壯，你永遠不敢荒唐。然而，所換得的：還只是半世飢餓，　　　　一生凄凉。</p>

<p>— 家明</p>
<p>水蒸氣塞滿了這一個房子，霧似的，輕紗似的。</p>
<p>穿過這一重輕紗，我望着這一個新進來的客人。</p>
<p>他有一團混身的白肉，豐滿的胸，豐滿的大腿。一堆濃厚的黑髮覆在這一個圓的腦袋。濃黑的眉，還有濃黑的短髮。這一張臉，像怪和善的。</p>
<p>凑巧地，他正站在我對面的浴間裏。</p>
<p>我並没有意思要和他發生什麼關係，但是正當我把肥皂擦滿了頭髮，把龍頭開了的時候，我猛的打了一個寒噤把</p>
<p>頭縮了回去。因爲不知怎的，熱水没有了，淋下來的全是冷水！</p>
<p>站在我對面的客人，同我一樣地，飽澆了滿身的凉水。於是我門都不期而然地埋怨那浴堂的管事，於是我們大家便交談起來。</p>
<p>「這浴間的設備眞是太壞了，像這機的事情是常常會弄出來的。」我的新交便這樣半帶太息的說着。</p>
<p>「唉，是的，」我縮在一旁，揉着滿擦了肥皂的頭髮，讓冷水灑在地上，「像這樣忽冷忽熱的眞要惱煞人！」</p>
<p>水又熱起來了。我冲洗着我的頭髮，把水淋在身上，一壁和他交換着零零碎碎的話。</p>
<p>和水的熱度漸漸地增加一樣，我們彼此也很快地談得很融洽了。大家赤裸着身體對站着，毫不拘束地，隨意玩着我們所能够想得出的話，彷彿是相熟的朋友似的。</p>
<p>他吿訴我許多浴堂裏的事情。他似乎把整個城裏面的浴堂都走了。他的話裏面有時帶着些可笑的故事，有時却有點像冒險的偵探小說似的。當他訴說着曾經有一個浴堂裏的茶房把一個客人的錢袋怎樣巧妙地藏了起來，結果却終於給那客人發覺了的故事之後，他用一種非常溫柔的感嘆的聲調說，</p>
<p>「這眞是多麼可怕的事情呵，一個人甚至在洗浴的時候也得刻刻留心着保護自己的錢袋。」</p>
<p>於是我們雙互相同情着嘆息現在社會人心的奸險，一直說到社會上許許多多的其他生活。</p>
<p>我們談得很起勁。我知道他姓郁，做小生意的。我也讓他知道我的名字和職業。</p>
<p>水蒸氣又濃起來了。透過了這一重紗，我又看見我的新交提着濕的毛巾把頭鑽出來。</p>
<p>「完了？」我問。</p>
<p>「完了，我先出去了。」他把手捋着頭髮上面的水，「洗完了，你還要到什麼地方去嗎？」(未完)</p>

<p>— 姚克</p>
<p>刮地的塵土撲　　地落在小攤上，粘在各種食物上，汽車過時，湯鍋裏彷彿像洒了一層胡椒末。這些是「吃窩窩」者所不在意的，卽使在意也無能爲力。有些人說他們抵抗力强，吃些圭土也不致害病或死亡：這話實在眞有見地，實在是不錯的！</p>
<p>我有一次和一個朋友抱着吃窩窩頭的决心，鼓着十二分的勇氣走到街頭一個小攤。剛想怩忸地坐下，忽然捲地一陣風，塵土罩住了整个攤面。我們面面相覷，勇氣消失了一半；這一陣土剛落下，一輛汽車飛馳過去又捲了一陣起來。我們再也不敢坐下了，只得到一個比小攤華貴一些的飯館去嘗試窩窩頭的滋味。</p>
<p>走進門是一個凵字形的大櫃臺，很矮但却很寬闊。櫃臺外面放着長凳，黑壓壓地坐滿了餓狼似的吃客。櫃上橫七堅八都是碗碟，一排碟子盛着醬菜和油醋，櫃角上有個大筷筒挨着一大扁筐的餅和窩窩頭。櫃裏中央放着一個爐子熬着大銅鍋的小米粥，三個伙計穿梭似地在那裏忙。</p>
<p>我們要了一碟窩窩頭，半斤烙餅，一碟芽豆，擠在人堆裏坐下。把窩窩頭擘開，一陣玉米香，喫在嘴裏有些甜津津的，不過又幹又粗實在很難下咽。好容易討了一大碗麪湯纔把這一碟子吃下肚：烙餅</p>
<p>只吃了三分之二，又呷了一小碗小米粥，胃裏已飽得漲騰騰地再也吃不下了。偷眼看别的吃客，只見他們的眼光像火一般釘住面前碗碟中的東西，腭骨邊的肌肉丨所謂的「咬筋」丨像火車輪上的軸桿一般推動着。整個的窩窩頭纔到他們嘴邊就彷彿變成了軟糖，一霎時就化得無影無踪。</p>
<p>這樣纔是吃窩窩頭的正規，典型；這是我從來所不知道的，不曾仔細看過的！他們的吃法决不是我們普通的吃法。我們吃時注重的是咀嚼，辨味；他們注重的是呑嚥，塞滿。所以我們所求者菜之精美；他們所求者物之粗實，務要塞得滿，耐得久，不易消化！在我們看來，吃的目的是「營飬」；在他們看來，吃的目的是「加油」！</p>
<p>在北海公園有個「仿膳食堂」是前淸御膳房的廚子開的，會做一種粟子大小的「窩窩頭」丨據說是從前皇帝吃的丨式樣卽玲瓏，口味又清美，甜蜜蜜地入口卽化，連咀嚼都不必，只須辨味。這只給供奉皇帝；勞動階級是决不要吃這種窩窩頭的。</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>「省長到了。」</p>
<p>「省長。」</p>
<p>聽别人說，知道來的人是大賣國賊熙洽。這可惡的東西，他出賣了吉林省，出賣了吉林全省的父老百姓，不，他出賣了整個東北給日本帝國主義！</p>
<p>軍樂隊特别爲他奏了很長時間的軍樂，憲警再爲他致了隆重的敬禮，日本小學生由敎員的領導，竟至一連喊了三聲「熙省長萬歲！」</p>
<p>警察加多了，他們原說是來維持秩序，其實，倒不如是來監視羣衆的他們是一羣可憐的走狗，我們是一羣可憐的奴才。</p>
<p>九點鐘的時候，臺上有人搖着鈴子，這是宣佈開會。緊接着放了三聲驚天動地的高升砲。所有的人，都自自然然地把視綫集中到臺面上。</p>
<p>「國旗揭揚式。」</p>
<p>這是第二項會序，看過之後，就覺得自己的眼睛當眞讓沙子迷住了：什麼呌揭揚式呢？我想，這大槪是句日本話，該是升國旗的意思吧？那，爲什麼要這樣標明呢，是讓人家同化了，還是爲的求得人家的歡心故意這樣討好？</p>
<p>兩面國旗同時升起來。不明白爲什麼每次開會升旗，總少不了日本的　國旗？這情形是二年前的會塲中所没有的。那太陽旗，紅的圓圓，不正是從東北民衆身上吸去鮮血！</p>
<p>司義在喊着第三項會序：</p>
<p>「向國旗行三鞠躬禮。」</p>
<p>越想越生氣，我連腰都没有彎。、</p>
<p>然後是唱國歌。說來羞愧，作了二年「滿洲國」的學生，還不會唱國歌，這原因，就是因爲悲傷的成分和羞恥壓住我的喉頭。我不唱，不會唱；但却不能阻止别人唱，於是，我還是要聽别人哼着鄭老頭子作的歌辭：</p>
<p>「天地間有了新滿洲；</p>
<p>新滿洲，便是新天地；</p>
<p>頂天立地，無苦無憂，</p>
<p>造成我國家，</p>
<p>只有親愛，並無怨仇！</p>
<p>人民三千萬，人民三千萬，</p>
<p>縱加十倍，也得自由！</p>
<p>重仁義，尙禮議，使我身修。</p>
<p>家已齊，國已治，此外何求。</p>
<p>近之則與世界同化，</p>
<p>遠之則與天地同流。」</p>

<h3 id="c149">破除迷信乎提倡迷信乎 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>中國人一向是崇尙迷信的，被迷信毒害了幾千年。自從歐美新思想輸入之後，破除迷信的聲浪，曾喧動過一時。及至國民軍統一了南北，一切文物制度，盡趨於革新之途，迷信亦在被改除之列。當時一班急進革命靑年，到處實行毁折廟宇，碎壞偶像，迷信勢力幾乎站不住脚。但迷信思想，於一般國人，本已根深蒂固；故儘管你嚷着要打倒迷信，迷信却至今依然存在。兼之目前的中國，事事已漸呈返古的氣象；迷信餘燼，自然也要復然起來。例如日來據報紙所載，上海居民，於淸明節，又有舉行城隍會之盛舉。市政府聞此消息，爲維持歷來破除迷信的主張（？）立令公安社會兩局會銜布吿，力加禁止；說是「迎神賽會，虛糜民財，提倡迷信，應循案取締」，呌百姓「毌得故違，致干未便」云。這一面我們可以明白人民思想之頑拙如故，一面亦足以看到當局者打倒迷信的苦心未滅。</p>
<p>然世事總是如此滑稽而有趣的。現時我國社會上最惹人耳目的大事，除了蔣委員長所提倡的新生活運動以外，要算是班禪大師所主持的時輪金剛法會了。此會先前曾在北平開過一次；今番乘國師南下之便，由國府要人之倡議，得社會有志者之贊助，已定四月二十八日起，設壇於杭州靈隱寺，以修盛事。據說舉行這個時輪金剛法會的目的，是在於消除國內的災禍，祈禱世界的和平。此外，法會爲求佛力加被，利益羣倫起見，又擬於法壇附設荐亡延生位次，請班禪活佛隨諸善信志願施濟之；或爲已故親族拔苦，或爲現存父母祈福。這樣看來，修建這個法會，眞算是功德無量了。雖然，此舉亦已有不少人出來反對了，理由是，修建法會，卽爲提倡迷信。</p>
<p>不錯，舉行城隍會一種迷信，應該禁止。但是修建法會，不也同樣是一種迷信，是應該取締的嗎？然而我國人的思想總是混混沌沌，糊里糊塗；一面要破除迷信，一面又要提倡迷信。好像破除迷信和提倡迷信這兩件絕對相反的事，是可以並行而不背似的，實是可笑極了！</p>
<p>有人說，時輪金剛法會和城隍會，雖同樣是個會，這其間却有一大分别；卽前者可以救國拔世，後者只會勞同傷財。我以爲果佛法無邊，能使國家寗靜，世界太平：城隍老爺本領雖小，難道他就没有力量呌幾個善男信女消災得福嗎？俗話說；「只許州官放火，不准百姓點燈」，其斯之謂乎？</p>
<h3 id="c150">頹廢與認識　丨願與靑年同儕共勉之丨 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 老牌</p>
<p>爲什麼我們的精神會頹廢呢？一般的說法是由於身體的病弱和先天的遺傳，引伸起來，說精神的振，頹，是由於身體的强弱，譬如體力之子身體，身體强的人，體力就大，身體弱的，體力就小。精神亦然：身體强的人精神就振作得弱的精神就頹廢。再進一步解釋身體孱弱的原因，第一是由於疾病，第二是先天的遺傳。結論便是若要精神不頹廢，只有先弄强身體，身體强壯了，精神便不頹廢。</p>
<p>在我認爲精神頹廢這一點，身體强弱固然有影響，但若就我們靑年頹廢的現象中，去細詢它的根原，則我覺得「認識」這一點，倒是一個很重要的原理。許多事的盲眛，錯誤，和由盲眛錯誤所引出來的許多不幸的事情，大都是因爲認識不澈的原故。原始人類崇拜自然，中世紀的人類崇拜宗敎，：：：都是由於不認識這事物的好象。我們知道，所謂認識者，是憑着深博的學識，精湛的眼光，精明的思考力去對於一個事物的分析和觀察。分析得越淸楚，觀察得越深到，就越是盡了認識的能事，能以認識爲工具，我們可以揭開一切事物，一切現象的蒙蔽物，那才可以接近事物的和現象的眞實。</p>
<p>我們分析靑年頹廢的現象，知道他們之所以頹廢並非由於身體病弱，也不是先天遺傳。我們知道一般靑年橫梗在心頭的問題，可以槪括地分作三點：第一是愛情問題，第二是職業問題，第三是思想問題，在這三者之中，尤以思想問題爲最重。有了這三者之一，就可使某一靑年頹廢下來，就可使一個活生生的漢子，平地成爲那麼淒凉的消沉者。要使自己免於這種頹廢的命運，我們便不能而向這現社會找出它的根本動力來。因爲我們知道了這根本動力，便會知道社會如何會產生這種魔力。現代的社會我們知道是個充滿着矛盾和黑暗的社會，使我們男女靑年卽管有了熱情，也找不着愛者，卽管有了愛者，也不能結合，使我們賤價出賣着自己，却還時常遭着失業的厄運。結果便使我仌覺得這世界充滿了黑暗，而使我們好像失了指導者一樣，不自主的徬徨和動搖起來。　　一個這樣的世界，假使我們不有一種深刻的眼光，認識這目前雖然充滿着矛盾，充滿着黑暗，充滿着罪惡，可是這祇不過是一種舊社會制度發展的最高度，發展到卽要總崩潰的前文的必然現象，則我們便很容易被這黑暗面所恫脅，所挫制，而果便使我們灰心頹廢起來。所以這其間，只是一個認識不認識的問題，决没有别的。</p>
<p>假使我們能够對現社會眞有明確的了解，則我們卽可知道，愛情的遭受狙擊，智力和體力的遭受無代價的壓榨，都是由於這不合理的現社會制度。假使我們進一步由史的考察知道這社會不是固定而是進代的，知道一個社會制度發展到一定的階段，它便不能不崩潰，則我們就不但可以知道我們的痛苦，失望，慘敗的原因，並且我們决定自己的思想，在這兩大潮流丨資本主義和社會主義丨激盪的當前，知道自己應該趨向於那一端，而不致使自己成爲一個没有出路，没有前途的落伍者。</p>
<p>怎樣能够做到這些呢？都是由於我們對現實的認識呵！所以我覺得身體的强弱不足以决定我們頹廢不頹廢的命運。反之認識不認識却是决定牠的根本的原因。所以我覺得要想使我們靑年的頹廢問題的幛幕，完全揭掉，祇有從「認識」上多做工夫。</p>

<p>— 健雄</p>
<p>人，畢竟是死要面子的動物，任何事情得媽虎過去，祇要一旦面子攸關，那就不惜犧牲一切，爭得一個面子的榮譽，可見在一般人眼裏看來，竟視同第二生命一樣，</p>
<p>面子，這虛空的東西，摸不到，吃不着，其所以給許許多多大衆去迷戀，去爭取，一直到死而不能促其醒悟，自</p>

<p>有其玄妙的作用底存在，</p>
<p>小而言之，平素在社會上有地位有名望的大人先生們，一旦受到某種勢力的襲擊，實際上早已宣吿破產了，但洋房不可不住，汽車不可不坐，手段還是同樣的闊綽，這樣，自然會有人借錢給他，而大人先生們的地位，聲望，及生活，也遂藉以維持，</p>
<p>再如一輩摩登小姐，摩登少奶奶，比大人先生爭求面子的程度，更深一倍，寗可當當頭，餓肚皮，而大衣不可不買，高跟皮鞋不可不穿，於是摩登哥兒見之，少不得追之求之，追之不得，鈔票塞之，終於一切問題，也都解决了，　　因爲面子要緊，塲面祇能硬撑，遂可收獲百靈機般的效果，於是問題也就在這裏擴大了起來，</p>
<p>人與人之間，發生了爭執，爲了面子關係，彼此不肯相讓，祇需有面子者,出而調解，一句話便可平靜無事，同時，甲方比乙方有面子，乙方祇得屈服，聽便甲方處置，所以東三省的失掉，也由於咱們中國在國際地位上没有面子的緣故，於是這個面子，便被日本人佔　　　中國人對自己拼命爭面子，對外却可以「忍辱負重」把面子拋掉，給東洋人做個人情，也許面子爭內不爭外，是中國人的特性，問題當然是例外的了！</p>
<p>還是一點，也是咱們中國人「死要面子」的表現，當兩脚朝天，毕挺挺横在棺才里之后，说也奇怪，似乎子孙们知道他底父母，有雖死而不忘面子的懿德，便發出大大的訃吿，印以遺容，請名人題些「哲人其萎」「無型安仰」之類，最後便在哀啓裏面，把死者有面子的祖宗，一齊牽出來，什麼「先高祖××公世藉××官至××：：：」然後再來一個「先嚴××公性頴悟，少卽留學歐美，：：：曾任××司司長：：：」無非是說死者是怎樣的忠厚，怎樣的考父母，愛國家，從來没有做過壞事，不論阿毛阿狗，都是千篇一例的刻板文章，似乎非這樣大吹大擂，不足以博得死者一個面子，替他爭得死後的哀榮（？），這也是多麼够滑稽够幽默的事情啊！（完）</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>現在我有一件數年來自己不能分析的疑難，懇求於先生不吝金玉的篇幅，爲我顯明的解答一下。但在未提起之前，得向先生道歉：我是不能發表姓名住址的，我明知此舉是違把貴欄之規則，但我有不得已的苦處，請你要原諒，並破例的爲我答覆一次吧！</p>
<p>我是被壓迫在一個最頑固的家庭之下的一個女子，今年已是二十四歲。在二十歲時，曾服務於某公司，當時有同事某介紹我一個男朋友，他比我大三歲，人很和氣，我亦極願與他接近。日子旣久，更爲親熱。後因我極怕羞，經不起她們（卽同事們）的取笑，同時又因頑固的家長，監視威嚴，以自由戀愛爲可恥。所以我便不敢顯露出我愛他的心思，惟有呑聲飲泣而已。及上海戰爭發生之後，人便賦閒居家，與他們接近很難，雖有時見面，亦不過閒談數語而已。去年春天，他亦已同他的女同事定婚，當然此事似乎與我是了無關係的，但事實上則適得其反，我每當靜坐或休息時，他的倩影常在腦海翻來覆去，以前的事實更一幕一幕頻頻表演不止，我屢次竭盡精神，想排除這些幻影，煩悶，始終不能實現。以致我痛苦萬分終日如在病境。我是失掉嚴親撫飬之人，惟兄是依，雖處境極難，亦乏人顧慮。近來予母更謂予年已長，急欲爲予成婚，習俗如此，此種舉動，在所難免。但不幸的我，旣受敎育之熏陶，復因他的原故，使我感覺非常困難。我想吾人之須結婚者，無非爲求幸福，求精神上安慰。今予母以媒妁之言爲可聽，不問對方之好壞，惟金錢是取，則予之一生幸福，前途暗伏危機，蓋可斷言。我亦屢次相勸，奈她固執的人，是終不肯聽的。更加我有時稍爲對她說不悅之事，她就淚眼相對，我生平最怕看見别人啼哭，何况我是處在女兒之地位。予問心難忍，再四思量，最妥善的辦法，是惟有一死。且日處家中，依人爲活，每每受人白眼相看，親友等時常向予譏笑，種種難處，言不勝言。處此徬徨境地，益令我求死之心更切，或者，我當局者迷，旁觀者淸：先生或許能給我想一個辦法也。此請撰安蘭芬叩上</p>
<p>答：蘭芬女士這封來信，字裏行間，無處不流露出一個宛和柔順的女子的性格，然而就因爲太柔順了，以致對於不成問題的事情也不能處理。所以編者所欲很鄭重地爲蘭芬女士吿者：是「做事果斷，毫不猶豫」八個字，祇要是爲正當做法，儘管放膽做去，否則顧忌一多，反而一事無成的。這是很重要的一點，希望你切莫以「老生常談」視之。</p>
<p>你的所謂「煩悶」，所謂「種種難處」歸納起來，不外乎兩種，一是對於過去受人的留戀，一是不願老母爲你訂婚。第一點，編者認爲是大可不必。人固然是感情的動物，何况你社交机会极少，對於愛人自然是戀戀不捨，雖然他或許是早把你忘掉了。然而我們要明瞭，人們的生活並不祇愛情一種，我們的幸福也不單是「男女之愛」所可包括完了的。在愛情上失敗了，還可向别方面之謀補償；反之，在愛情上很美滿，但人生的别種方面却有許多缺陷，也不見得是幸福。所以編者所希望你的第一點是把愛情看得輕一點。再則，你們雖然很親熱，但你旣因怕羞，不敢追求他，他也没有明顯的對你表露出愛慕的態度，照此種情形，實談不上是戀愛也。而且，他如現在還戀戀不忘，眞未免太痴了。</p>
<p>男女相處一久，是可以創造愛情的，但這也不是說隨便遇着什麼人就會創造愛情的。這好比如交友一樣，起初遇着一個陌生人，覺得有點不高興他，但後來相處一久，倒也覺得他並不推板，結果也許會變成爲朋友。所以編者希望你對於舊式婚姻，不必抱着十分畏懼的態度，祇要槪略地曉得對方的品性，人相，並不十分壞，那就可以結婚，等到結婚後再創造出愛情，出並不是不可能的。總之，在我們這個時代，應當把我們所要做的事業看得重一些，愛情生活應當放在第二位。</p>
<p>話又說回來了，編者所希望你的，所能供獻你的，祇是「果斷」兩個字，怕難爲情，顧頭顧尾，最是壞事。你愛某人，當時儘可拚命去追求，不必怕什麼難爲情，後來不成功，却應爽爽快快，就此丢開。你從前的那個愛人，雖則你心裏十分愛他，但編者恐怕他到現在還是蒙在鼓裏，並不知道你是這樣的愛他呵！也許你當時如果很明顯地向他求愛，說不定你與他早已成了眷屬呢？</p>

<p>— 亦敏</p>
<p>去年可以說是暹羅華僑的兇年，自該國民黨執政以來什麼修改移民條例（凡不識字的人不能進口，不過二十歲的人不能出口），增加入口稅（以前去暹，每人只需十五元暹幣的入口稅，現在竟增加到一百元暹幣，返暹羅護照費，也由五元加到二十元：改用暹文簿記（上自銀行，下至雜貨鋪，一律要改用暹文簿册，以便居留政府的隨時查核）：徵收各種苛稅（除了原有的人頭稅外的又徵所得稅，匯兌稅，舊貨稅，以及火柴等日用品，都要徵收重稅；並實施所謂强迫敎育（下節說明）等種種苛律，都於去年先後實行，再加以世界不景氣，惡魔，闖進了暹國，以致有幾家碾米廠和鋸木廠，不得不因銷路停滯而歇業，還有許多商店，爲了無力償還賬欵，竟不顧利害的自己放起火來，藉以賴債，而火柴的人數，也一天天的激增。這些現象，是說明了暹羅華僑的黄金時代，已經是成爲過去七華僑敎育的往事了。</p>
<p>華僑在暹羅辦學校，是有二十多年的歷史了，全暹合計一百多只小學（私塾不在內），四五萬學生，中學是最近二三年才有的，計有華僑，中華，南洋，新民，崇寳等數校，但都只辦到初中，而且中學生的人數也極少，合起來恐怕還不到　五百　，我們假定在三百萬僑胞中，學齡兒童佔二十萬的話，那末受敎育的還不到　十分之二，而學生的年齡，又大都是超過了學齡，一個小學畢業生，普通總在十八九歲，所以暹羅華僑敎育的不發達，於此也就可見一斑，</p>

<h3 id="c156">關於「烈熖的評價」及其他 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>當我偶然的讀到了木天先生的「烈熖的評價」的當時，自己的確不免有一點惶惑。這因爲他是除了一受了長時間廣吿宣傳的影響外，而且是「又看見了電影專刋上的過高的評價」才去看的，結果是使他「乘興而去，敗興而返」。於是多不得不反問自己，難道我眞的是騙了這一位「前進的詩人」麼？否則便是詩人只會做詩，對於電影還「没弄到所以然」。</p>
<p>「烈熖」的批評是我寫的，因爲自己總得對讀者負責，所以當時我很想寫一點什麼吿讀者並答木天先生。但是後來我又相信那一篇文章到底没有錯到那兒去，而且我並不要求　每一個「烈焰」的觀衆都非和我的意見完全一樣不可，（這當然也是做不到的）。那末又何必枉費筆墨呢？</p>
<p>但是事情常不如我們所想像的那般簡單，一連看了好幾天的大晚報，似乎使我非說不可。這便是我寫這一篇文章的動機。</p>
<p>關於「烈熖」，事實上我决不想替劇作者辯護，但是劇作者自採取題材以至於處理，他都是不不能不顧及目前惡劣的環境，而迀廻曲折的說出了我們所要說的話，這一點除了存心爲權勢者作舌人或者是帮助着更殘酷的打擊中國電影的正人君子之外，的確是應當同情劇作者的苦心而加以若干原諒的；假使他在技術上也有小的錯誤的話。不錯，在目前環境之下，導演者不能不避重就輕的在主題之外多作無謂的文章，（如對於阿貞之虛榮的描寫）甚至於將地主家跳舞的火熖延燒草棚改爲阿貞的不小心，諸如此類，難道就値得詩人破口大駡嗎？同時，一點也不錯，我們得强調的要求現實，這是毫無問題的。例如我們要求「風」的作者今後注意着百分之百的現實性，但是當我們知道那是經過一番無理的剪切的時候，我們却不能不同情作者之苦心了。然而木天先生却說「花落」「烏籠」都是要不得的「頹廢的象」，那就不免是非理要求了。至於說「水零零的眼睛，」「小橋流水」，「綠樹濃陰」，都使詩人看不上眼：甚至於要說明救火會是在愚園路地豐路轉角，别莊是在江灣等等，那就只好使人發笑。前者固然不應當過於誇張鄕村的自然風景而破壞影片情緒，這只能說是導演不能更進一步的理解，但是我們决不說「小橋」不應「流水」，「綠樹」不應「濃蔭」，，便是百分之百的現實。而後者呢！多總不相信說明救火會是在木天先生家前門，或是别莊在他家的後門，便是不「觀念」，「不虛構」的罷。</p>
<p>在木天先生接連的幾篇大文中，一次又一次的提着要求電影中的現實，如上述，我們可知道他對於現實是怎樣解釋的了。然而假使更進一步來觀察，他不過是以現實爲遁詞，實際上對較有意義的中國電影加以摧殘，聊盡「帮閒」的責任，那末我们將不知何以來體念這「前進的詩人」之「藝術的」用心了。至於說「烈熖」中的保險公司是存心替帝國主義說敎」，「香草美人」的工人應當說得亂七八糟，使盡面成爲不知所云的毫無頭緒，那又是莫測高深的詩人的見解了。</p>

<p>Sleepers　East丨大上海丨</p>
<p>偵探片是和Gangster的影片一樣地過時了。雖然偵探片也曾吸引過多少小市民觀衆的心理。</p>
<p>小市民們感到日常生活的煩燥，枯澀，平凡，他們需要刺戟，於是偵探片如同偵探小說一樣地被小市民們所愛看。</p>
<p>這一張「罪證」是由小說而搬上了銀幕的。</p>
<p>普通一般偵探片，都是吿訴我們罪犯是怎樣的殘酷，怎樣的兇惡和不可寬恕，另一方面吿訴了我們偵探是如何的神勇，如何的聰敏智慧，使人欽佩。</p>
<p>然而，在「罪證」裏却客觀地暴露了市民的陰險，奸詐，這是「罪證」所値得稱許的地方，雖然這並不是主題，而依舊緊抓住着「戀愛」。</p>
<p>而且，「罪證」還有和别的偵探片兩樣的地方，普通的偵探片用曲折離奇的結構，出人意料之外的恐怖和緊張的空氣，而緊抓住觀衆的情緒。但是在這「罪證」裏却先交代淸楚兇手的面貌，以及慘案的如何發生，這是「罪證」和其他偵探片不同的地方，而也是「罪證」的不能抓住觀衆的情緒的原因。</p>
<p>所以，「罪證」是張平庸的偵探片。在演出上，是完全失敗的。冗長的對白，繁悶的故事，枯澀的空氣，這一切完全不能抓住和緊張起觀衆的情緒的。　　而在這裏，也還免不了和其他偵探片一般的凑巧强合的地方，如蓋安德殺赖持，而恰見溫華在殺賴持等勉强的地方。</p>
<p>導演的處理也不行，倒是那個溫淇潑遜表演得還令人滿意。</p>

<p>“The　Women　in　His　Life"</p>
<p>丨國泰丨</p>
<p>故事是這樣的。一個律師，接受了一件替殺人嫌疑犯的辯護事件，被殺的是一個中年女子，而嫌疑犯就是這女子的丈夫。事情很巧，這被殺的女子，恰恰是現在替嫌疑犯担任辯護的律師的以前的情人，他們以前有過一段戀愛的經過，後來女的失了踪，而男的呢，到案發之日爲止，還將她當作一個日夕思念的愛人。</p>
<p>這樣的題材，在閙劇的觀點不失爲一個很好的故事，祇要人物個性和環境配置得適宜，也許可以產生出一部相當有力量的影片。</p>
<p>可是，現在在銀幕上所看到的，却完全和預想的反對，主人翁律師的個性，描寫得非常的含糊和矛盾，開塲出現的，他就是一個花花公子，他的職業，好像不是辦案而祇是專和女子交際，在這樣的氛圍之下，一旦以前的情人被殺，就會驚悸悲痛而至於瘋狂，這已經不能使人相信。</p>
<p>加之，要這片子裏面，觀衆的同情都徧重在嫌疑犯和他的女兒，所以律師的「一往情深」和職業與感情的衝突，完全變成了不被注意的存在。發狂之後直至設計破案爲止，這一段心理描寫，不能得到觀衆的理解和同情，所以戲的缺點，可以說是在不曾抓住故事的中心，和不能分淸主題和傍綫的層次，不能强調主題，不能御制觀衆感情，是這片子導演的弱點。</p>
<p>在「亡命者」，使我們知道了所謂法律是一種隨意可以由少數人而伸縮改變的工具，而在這「女性的魔力」中，也許不是製作者的本意，却明白地吿訴了我們法律是一種近似游戲的東西。不管别人死活，除了賺錢和沽名之外，不將案件當作自己職責所在的「公理代言人」的，大槪也很不少。假使說這片子最値得一看的時候，那麼他的眞實性就在實地暴露了這一類人的生活和社會機能這一點，當然，這並不是製作者所預期的結果。</p>
<p>如上所述，這影片在劇作術上已經有了重大的缺點，手法的零亂，更在其次。後半部因爲側重偵探趣味而應該緊張的地方，更顯出支離瑣碎，這是降低米高梅水凖之作。</p>
<p>入後，照例的Happy　Ending本可不必苛責，可是，最後那一組的結婚，實在可以說，是影片製作者對藝術没有嚴肅性的一個例證。</p>

<p>— 殷鳴</p>
<p>有一天他們在園裏散着步，娜娜然站住了，將一個長著許多葉子的東西拔了起來。她驚奇地喊道：「哦：：這就是蘿菔。我總以爲它是長在車子上的呢！」這使喬治狂笑起來並且他將她抱住了。娜娜在他懷裏，很快樂的歎了一口氣。她說：「我愛這個地方。我希望你亦喜歡。」喬治道：「我當然是喜歡的。我在這裏可以望得見你的窗户的。」他指着一個窗户問她道：「那是不是你的房間？」娜娜道：「是的。那個房間美麗得很，但是一個女人住，覺得太大些！使人覺得怪冷靜的。喬治道：「那個窗離地不過三尺，你一個人睡覺不怕嗎？」娜娜張大了眼睛問道：「怕什麼？」「唔：：要是有一個不怕死的人，你不怕嗎？」娜娜道：「這裏隣近，並没有什麼不怕死的人吓。」喬治道：「可是確有一個瘋狂的人：：」他說着就將她抱住了，很命地吻着。娜娜嬌嗔道：「寳貝，小心給人家看見了。」喬治道：「這裏除掉素伊，咪咪，和𤩀丁之外，並没有什麼别的人吓。我們的事情。他們還有不明白的嗎？」正在這個時候，索伊和咪咪。𤩀丁等，亦正在談論他們兩個人的事情。索伊用那老於世故，料事如神的口吻對𤩀丁道：「隨他們去吧。要是一男一女，在菜園裏亦會作愛，那一定是無可救藥的了！」</p>
<p>這樣經過了四個禮拜之久，他的哥哥安特利對於他的兄弟和娜娜的事情，早就有所風聞。有一天的早晨，他的哥哥在屋子裏用千里鏡向隔壁的房子照着。他照的地方，就是那離地三尺的窗户。他照了一回，將千里鏡放下了，等着他兄弟回來。一回兒他的兄弟果然回來了，但是他回來的路，不是從大門進來的，而是從窗户裏跳進來的。他跳了進來，看見他的哥哥扳着臉，就嚇了一跳。安特利冷冷地對着他的兄弟道：「你倒眞早呀，恐怕你用這個窗户，不止一次了吧？」喬治連忙掩飾道：「我早晨出去散步，因爲不願意擾亂家庭，所以不走大門的。」安特利怒目看着他的兄弟道：「擾亂家庭亦有幾種幾樣的方法。喬治，我們的家族，是個有名的家族，我希望你能够崇敬它。」喬治道：「我想我並没有什麼不尊重家族名譽的地方呀。」安特利怒氣勃勃的說道：「這個女人我知道了很久了。你：：她：：」喬治插嘴道：「慢慢，安特利，我愛那個女人。我愛她就完了。我愛她，我不久就要和她結婚了。」「結婚？你和她？」喬治道：「不差的，請你拿你的口氣改改吧。」「你傻子！你是小孩子！」安特摸着額角，顯着絕端失望的樣子，然後他突然間面色一變，變成了一個軍中長官對屬員的態度。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Troops Use Pretext of Bandit Suppression to Re-enter Zunhua and Fengrun; Request County Chiefs to Find Barracks; Japanese Planes Reconnoiter Zunhua County Seat; More Than 1,000 Japanese Troops Reach Malanyu <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Provincial Government received reports from the county chiefs of Zunhua and Fengrun, receiving a letter from the Japanese garrison gendarmerie headquarters in Malanyu, requesting that they find housing to accommodate the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops, in order to prevent bandits from disturbing the war zone, will soon send a team to provide cooperative defense. The two county chiefs received the official letter on the same day, and not daring to make a decision, telegraphed for instructions. On the afternoon of the 7th, two Japanese planes flew over Zunhua County, circling and taking photographs, flying at low altitude for half an hour before leaving, causing great panic among the residents. The Japanese army's Motegi Brigade, consisting of an artillery squadron and an infantry battalion, about 700 men, arrived in Malanyu on the 8th. The troops carried a great deal of supplies, and were stationed in the old Qing Dynasty Yongying barracks south of the Qing Tombs. Together with the Japanese troops who arrived earlier, there are now more than 1,000 Japanese troops in the area. Another part of the Japanese army is advancing westward from Chicheng, seemingly heading towards Xifengkou in eastern Chahar. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to foreign sources today, the Japanese troops in Gubeikou, Chahar, are not reinforcements, but a rotation. Foreign observers firmly believe that the Japanese authorities are now trying to create an atmosphere to influence Huang Fu's mission regarding the opening of traffic and postal services. Military force is only the last resort, but at present, there seems to be no such preparation. It was previously rumored that thirty Japanese planes had arrived in Malanyu and Chengde, but according to the magistrate of Ji County, this is not true. However, Japanese personnel are quite active along the Great Wall, it is said. (9th Reuters) (Beiping) Huo Shi returned to Gubeikou on the 2nd and 3rd. According to reports, the Gubeikou puppet border police force has a total of seventy people, only responsible for inspection at Nantianmen. The captain is a Japanese named Hong Lu. Matsui indicated that the team is building houses in Bakeshiying outside the pass, and at the latest by the end of the month, they can withdraw completely. There are about 400 Japanese troops stationed in Gubeikou, with no increase. The puppet planes only inspect the customs and verify passports. The investigation of road passes is all at the city walls. It is true that the Japanese recruited 5,000 Chinese laborers for export, but recruitment has now stopped. The traitor Xu Yinzhang, after extorting money in Shunyi, has been sent back to Gubeikou. The Japanese Captain Nagami ordered him to leave the country within three days. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng told reporters on the 9th: (1) The puppet police at Nantianmen and Caojialu are withdrawing. After discussions among Zishan, Matsui, and Huo Shi, Matsui decided to go to Changchun on the 10th to ask Hishikari for instructions, and can withdraw immediately after returning to Rehe. (2) The severance pay for the Yutian security team has been received, and will begin to be disbursed within days. (3) Although the number of Japanese troops in Gubeikou has increased recently, it is only a transit. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, someone in the war zone captured several military pigeons with trachoma.

<p>(Tianjin) Asami, the captain of the Japanese garrison in Tangshan, stated that the Japanese side is unwilling to take the blame for others, nor is it willing to be suspected of protecting Zhao Dazhong, but since it concerns the security and order of the war zone, the Japanese side cannot ignore it. Therefore, it is hoped that the Chinese authorities will handle this matter with caution. The Kailuan Mining Bureau received a report this morning that more and more workers in the Tangshan mine's inner shift went down the mine today, with 60-70% implementing the work under the lights. This morning at 6 o'clock, the striking miners gathered outside the mine's office, requesting to be given work and agreeing to return to work unconditionally. The mine manager, fearing that the workers would deceive him and carry out destructive measures after going down the mine, refused. The workers insisted that they had no other intentions and sincerely wanted to resume work. The mine manager then telegraphed for several security teams to guard outside the mine entrance, and selected five or six hundred good people, ordering them to return to work that morning. The others were told to wait until the mine bureau received an official announcement of a solution from the government before they would be allowed to return to work. Thousands of workers who were not allowed to return to work all frowned and hurriedly dispersed. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The first battalion of the first regiment of the war zone security team was ordered by the provincial government on the evening of the 8th to leave its defense area in Luan County and go to Tangshan to assist the Tangshan Public Security Bureau's security team in preventing accidents. Currently, rumors are rife in Tangshan, saying that the garrison team of a certain country is displeased because our side wants to arrest Zhao Dazhong, and will take decisive punitive measures, so the people are becoming increasingly panicked. On the night of the 8th, the Public Security Bureau cooperated with the security team to be on guard all night, and fortunately nothing happened. Today, the streets of Tangshan are plastered with announcements urging workers to quickly repent and return to work, not to be used by Zhao Dazhong, and pointing out evidence that Zhao is a traitor, but without the official names of any organizations. The War Zone Workers' Autonomous United General Union, located on Guangdong Street in Tangshan, is no longer staffed, with only a few servants watching the house. Zhang Zhenfu and Ma Deliang have both gone into hiding and no longer call themselves labor representatives. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the evening of the 9th, the Luan-Yu Commissioner's Office issued a notice, setting a deadline of 1 a.m. on the 10th for the Tangshan mine workers on the inner shift and three days for workers on the outer shift to unconditionally return to work. Those who disobey will be dismissed and arrested. Martial law was imposed in Tangshan from noon on the 9th and intensified at night. The security team and police were all mobilized, extensively searching for the leaders of the strike, Zhao Dazhong. At 4:30 p.m. on the 9th, protected by a Japanese named Nakamura, he fled to Shanhaiguan. According to the Commissioner's Office's announcement, all new and old workers' unions in Tangshan are dissolved. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

Tao Shangming, Zhao Xunwei, and Zhao Lei invited Zhao on the evening of the 8th to discuss Zhao Dazhong's departure, but no decision was made after several hours. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Zhu Shiqin, on behalf of He Yingqin, went to Tangshan to resolve the Kailuan mine strike and returned to Beiping on the 9th. At 11 a.m., he visited He to report on his mission. It is said that the Kailuan worker unrest has no background, but was incited by the traitor Zhao Dazhong, taking advantage of Tao Shangming's inability to command the security team and public security police. After I arrived in Tangshan, I summoned Zhao Lei and Zhao Xun, and earnestly advised them, and strictly ordered the dispatch of teams to resolve the worker unrest. If they did not obey the order, the security team would be disbanded. Zhao and others then dispatched teams to arrest the traitors, and Zhao Dazhong also fled to Yu, and the worker unrest came to an end. The miners have been given a deadline of the 9th to return to work. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The provincial government telephoned this morning, urging Tao Shangming, the commissioner of the Tangshan Special Administrative District, to quickly resolve the mine unrest. Tao Shangming, because Zhao Lei is protecting Zhao Dazhong, cannot arrest him. This morning, he specifically sent Zhu Zhenwu, the secretary of the commissioner's office, to Tianjin to ask Chairman Yu for instructions on how to handle the matter, and to report on the current situation of the worker unrest. Yu ordered that the original order be followed, and ordered the secretary to return to Tangshan that evening to convey the order. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a Tangshan phone call, in order to obtain 20,000 yuan in travel expenses for Zhao Dazhong, Zhao Lei hosted the Japanese garrison captain Asami and Tao Shangming, Zhao Xun, and others at the Jingzhou Hotel in Tangshan tonight to discuss ways to obtain the money. Zhao Dazhong is still hiding in Tangshan, and has not gone elsewhere. It is rumored that Zhao Lei has sent him to Yuguan, but the authorities have not yet received a report.

The ship was ordered to dock at the naval wharf, light its fire, and be ready to depart. The naval band and others also went to the wharf to prepare to see him off. At 7 p.m., Wang notified the naval wharf by telephone, saying that he would not depart for the time being. The band and others then withdrew.

Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Liu Shouzhong, Fang Juehui, Deng Jiayan, Li Zonghuang, Xiao Jishan, Kexing'e, and other staff members, totaling over six hundred people, attended. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. Zhang Ji reported, stating that at this time when the country is in danger, the people of the whole country are still very depressed and decadent, and the habit of falling and dissipation is becoming more and more serious, which is truly frightening. Therefore, Chairman Chiang's promotion of the New Life Movement is indeed the best way to awaken the people to save the country from danger. I believe that its meaning should be further elaborated, and the power of the party should be used to actively promote it, imitating the methods of Italy and Germany to revitalize the country, to rescue the declining morale, to awaken our national soul through the new life of the people, and to establish a strong nationalism. Only then can saving the country from danger be effective. Dr. Sun Yat-sen also said that the Chinese revolution is inheriting the inherent traditions of Chinese history, so we should not rely on others and lose the inherent morality and spirit of our nation's propriety, righteousness, integrity, and sense of shame. Only by using the inherent spirit of the nation can we awaken the people to strive for rejuvenation. This is also the case in various European and American countries. The government should no longer indulge the people's declining morale, and must be good at guiding and correcting it. I hope that all comrades will strive to promote the New Life Movement.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its Memorial Week on the morning of the 9th. Deng Jiayan, Chen Gongbo, Tang Shengzhi, Li Yuanding, Chu Minyi, Liu Shouzhong, Kong Xiangxi, Lin Xiang, Chen Qicai, Cao Haosen, Wei Huai, Lu Chao, and staff members from various ministries and commissions, totaling over three hundred people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Kong Xiangxi reported, stating that since the government approved the silver agreement through legislative procedures with reservations, domestic people have been discussing the pros and cons of the silver price and its impact on our country. Some say that China is an importing country and the increase in silver prices will affect the export of national goods in international trade, and foreign goods can be dumped. Some say that our country is in urgent need of revitalizing industry, and the increase in silver prices can allow us to purchase a large amount of machinery with a small amount of silver, which is not without benefit to our country. I, as the head of finance, am not in a position to express my opinion. However, regardless of the silver price, I believe that stabilizing the silver price is the most important thing, so that our country can overcome this difficult situation in the midst of the world economic panic.

<p>(Nanchang) The Jiangxi Headquarters held its Memorial Week on the morning of the 9th. Northwestern generals Pang Bingxun and others, as well as staff members of the Headquarters, totaling over five hundred people, attended. Chairman Chiang led the ceremony and spoke about the appearance of Nanchang city, military etiquette, and the responsibilities of the police. He then said that last week, when meeting with northern generals, he asked about their impressions after arriving in Jiangxi. One general said something very appropriate. He said, "What we have visited is mostly prepared in advance, so we cannot see its true appearance, but we have one very deep impression, that is, from Nanchang to Nanfeng, even in the midst of intense bandit suppression, the order of the stations and the people along the way is good, not at all disorganized or flustered. This is not only unprecedented in China in the past, but even foreigners find it difficult to do." Chiang then explained that the recent order that publications should not use foreign characters for year numbers on the cover unless necessary was an order to the political training staff of the Headquarters, but the Political Training Department sent it to the Central Propaganda Committee to be circulated throughout the country, which is absurd. I, Chiang Kai-shek, am not the Central Party Headquarters, not the government. How can my order be given to the Central Propaganda Committee and circulated throughout the country? Isn't that a joke? I hope that all staff members will clearly identify the system and understand the procedures when handling affairs in the future, so that they can share the burden for those above and not mess things up.

<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>In recent days, the situation in North China, according to dispatches from Peiping [Beijing], is gradually revealing a crisis. Firstly, the takeover of the Malanyu area has virtually stalled. Furthermore, over a hundred Japanese reserve officers are traveling to Hebei, Shandong, Chahar, and Suiyuan under the guise of tourism, but their actual intentions are difficult to ascertain. Simultaneously, a large number of Japanese aircraft have arrived in Malanyu, and military exercises are being conducted in the war zone (i.e., the area east of Tianjin and north of Ji County), which is particularly alarming. Moreover, Japanese aircraft are flying over eastern Chahar, spying everywhere, seemingly as a prelude to military action. The puppet troops of Li Shouxin are also stationed within the territory of Guyuan, posing a constant threat of provocation. Thirdly, the labor unrest in Tangshan remains unresolved. While it may appear to be a simple labor-management dispute, the leader of the movement, Li Dazhong, is not a worker and there are also firearms involved, suggesting hidden agendas. These are just a few of the major issues in the complex situation. Investigating the underlying crisis, it's clear that a single incident could trigger a chain reaction, plunging North China into tragedy. As a prominent figure has stated, if there is no comprehensive and concrete strategy to deal with the situation diplomatically, the hidden anxieties about the future will be immeasurable. Diplomacy must be backed by national strength. The central government is focused on strengthening its own power. The saying "internal stability before external resistance" embodies this principle. The current crisis is even more urgent than after the Mukden Incident and before the loss of Rehe. At that time, countries around the world had not yet actively implemented economic nationalism, and relations with Japan were not as strained as they are now. The international community still expressed moral sympathy towards us. As long as we made concrete preparations, there was still room for maneuver. Now, international diplomacy has reverted to the state it was in before 1914, especially in the Far East. How can our country escape danger and achieve national rejuvenation in this difficult situation? Can we afford to delay any longer and not pay close attention?</p>
<p>The key to internal stability lies in the people's livelihood. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings have clearly articulated this. Today, China's national economy is on the verge of collapse. Even in Shanghai, the market has shown deep panic since the spring, indicating a precarious future for our national economy. Even without external threats, the situation is deeply worrying. Therefore, to achieve genuine internal stability, we must make tenfold the effort to improve the national economy. It is undeniable that our industry is backward, and the decline of rural areas has undermined the foundation of our agricultural nation. To reverse this decline, we must first focus on increasing agricultural production and improving the consumption levels of farmers. The living standards of Chinese farmers have already fallen to the lowest possible level. While eliminating extravagance and promoting frugality are important in urban areas, we should focus on encouraging the improvement of living standards for the common people in rural areas. However, in rural areas today, grain prices are low, side businesses are declining, and economic circulation is on the verge of collapse. In provinces like Henan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, even a small amount of one yuan is considered a treasure. Illegal banknotes flood the market, and the suffering of farmers is hard to describe. Therefore, we should quickly implement credit cooperatives to provide some financial flexibility to the rural economy, and then seek a balance between production and consumption. If the rural economy can truly recover, the construction of new industries will have a clear path forward. The construction of railways, the consumption of textiles, and the promotion of other transportation industries may seem to be within the scope of industrial revitalization, but they are all based on agriculture. In this era of self-sufficiency, the raw materials for our domestic industries must come from our own country. As for national defense preparations, all military facilities and the supply of military necessities depend on the supply of food and raw materials from agriculture. While weapons require a solid industrial foundation, they also rely on a prosperous economy to cope with international changes. Given the urgency of the current international crisis, is it too slow to calmly discuss the economy and military preparations? However, it must be understood that if we cannot overcome the economic difficulties and build a foundation from agriculture and industry, then national defense construction will remain empty words. A gradual approach is ultimately the most fundamental and crucial strategy.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Elections Begin in the United States; Democratic Party Still Able to Maintain Its Advantage <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Tomorrow, the State of Illinois in the United States will hold its primary election. This is the first test of the American people's political views since President Roosevelt defeated the Republican Party in 1932. The political fog is gradually clearing. In this general election, the Democratic Party will still be able to maintain its strength in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Prominent figures in the Republican Party predict that the party will lose four seats in the Senate in the upcoming general election, while gaining fifty to sixty seats in the House of Representatives. Many Republicans consider this pessimistic, but there is factual evidence for these gains and losses. The Democratic Party currently holds a majority of 191 seats in the House of Representatives. Even if the Democratic Party's power is not as strong as it is today in the upcoming general election, it will certainly not lose all 191 seats. If the Republican Party wants to control the Senate in the upcoming general election, it must not only hold onto its current seats in the Senate but also win fourteen seats currently held by the Democratic Party. As it stands, the Republican Party has no ability to do this. Even if the Republican Party goes all out to face the upcoming parliament and assumes that it can get the vote of Senator Shipstead of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party, it can only cause the Democratic Party to lose thirteen seats in the Senate. The total number of seats to be changed in the upcoming general election is 435 in the House of Representatives, 35 in the Senate, and 35 governorships in various states. The primary elections in South Dakota and Alabama will be held on May 1, after Illinois. The primary election in Indiana will be held on May 8, which will also affect the seat of Republican Senator Robinson. Robinson previously loudly opposed the government's austerity policy, advocated for the interests of American veterans in the European War, and ridiculed the American government's failure to obtain repayment of war debts from foreign countries. The states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Connecticut will also hold primary elections in mid-May, while North Carolina, Iowa, California, Florida, Oregon, and Minnesota will hold primary elections in mid-June. The states of Oklahoma, Montana, and Texas will hold primary elections in mid-July. The primary elections in other states will generally be held in mid-August and September. Delaware, New Mexico, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Utah are exceptions because there are no legal regulations for primary elections in these states. Therefore, the dates of the primary elections in these states are determined by the central committees of each party. The terms of office for the Senate seats of the Democratic Party (17 seats), the Republican Party (17 seats), and the Farmer-Labor Party (1 seat) will expire this year. During the past political wave in the United States, President Roosevelt received great support in both houses of Congress. The number of seats held by each party in the two houses is as follows: (Senate) Democratic Party: 60 seats, Republican Party: 35 seats, Farmer-Labor Party: 1 seat; (House of Representatives) Democratic Party: 313 seats, Republican Party: 113 seats, Farmer-Labor Party: 5 seats. Since the establishment of the Roosevelt administration in 1932, there have been no Republicans in the administrative departments. There are currently nine Republican governors, eight of whom will have their terms expire this year.

<h3 id="e51">Hirota's Diplomacy Contains a Conspiracy to Invade China and Russia; Only Willing to Sign a Non-Aggression Pact with the United States; Minister of War Hayashi Holds Prime Minister Saito Hostage <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota believes that it is necessary to negotiate a ten-year or even permanent separate non-aggression treaty between Japan and the United States as a preparatory step for the upcoming disarmament conference. However, American officials are highly skeptical of this proposal, wondering whether Japan will refrain from aggressive activities in the Far East after the establishment of a separate Japan-U.S. non-aggression treaty or non-war treaty. Therefore, they informally suggest that the separate Japan-U.S. treaty should be expanded into a multilateral non-aggression treaty involving China, the United States, Russia, and Japan. Hirota responds that while the intention to make it a multilateral treaty is understandable, it is necessary to resolve outstanding issues such as the Sino-Soviet dispute over the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Manchurian issue with China before such a treaty can be considered. He is determined to continue efforts to establish a separate Japan-U.S. treaty based on this view. (Dentsu telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of War Hayashi, following the lead of former Minister of War Araki's advocacy for national defense policies, met with Araki on the night of the 2nd to discuss these policies and will meet with him several more times to hear the content and aspirations of his proposed policies. He will then use these as the foundation for carefully drafting his own policies. The core of Hayashi's proposed policies leans toward resolving the Manchurian problem, with a focus on strengthening Japan-Manchukuo cooperation and the economy and industry of Jiangzhou. According to Hayashi, he is still unclear on how to propose these policies to Prime Minister Saito, but he believes that the Manchurian problem is the most important from a national defense perspective. (Dentsu telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of War Hayashi plans to visit Prime Minister Saito before the cabinet meeting on the 10th to discuss important policies. He generally believes that the cabinet's mission will end after the parliament adjourns, and that maintaining the status quo may not be advantageous given the objective circumstances. He will convey this intention to Prime Minister Saito, hoping to give the Prime Minister a great impetus. Hayashi also has considerable practical policies for establishing domestic and national policies and for breaking out of the extraordinary situation. There are doubts about whether Prime Minister Saito has the conviction to resolve the remaining disciplinary problems from the parliamentary session. It is said that Hayashi will first report on his visit to Prince Saionji and the proceedings of the cabinet meetings after his departure from Tokyo so as to understand the recent situation and to discuss the above-mentioned issues. In short, the results of the meeting between Hayashi and Saito will have a significant impact on the political situation, and all parties are paying close attention. (Nichi-Rengo telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito decided to hold a meeting with the three elder statesmen before the cabinet meeting on the 10th. However, because he had to meet with Minister of War Hayashi on the morning of the 10th, he changed the meeting to 2:00 PM on the 9th, inviting Finance Minister Takahashi and Interior Minister Yamamoto to his residence to discuss important matters such as the movement to overthrow the cabinet centering on a certain incident and the aftermath of appointing a dedicated Minister of Education. (Nichi-Rengo telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito has decided to take advantage of the temporary break to consider various options for the second step in the appointment of a Minister of Education. He believes that it is advisable not to appoint a dedicated Minister of Education for the time being, but to have the Minister of War concurrently hold the position. He will then find a way to fill the position when the time is right. However, because of the government's attitude this time, the Seiyukai party has hardened its position, and an obstinate movement to overthrow the cabinet has emerged. The indictment of Justice Minister Oyama and a major incident currently under investigation are the leading forces against the cabinet. The government is in a state of siege and should have a considerable determination to deal with the above-mentioned plots. The Prime Minister will consult with the two elder statesmen, the Finance Minister and the Interior Minister, on the aftermath before the regular cabinet meeting on the 10th. At the same time, he will take serious precautions against the movement to overthrow the cabinet and clarify the government's confidence in undertaking and implementing its policies and guidelines for the future situation in order to stabilize the political situation. He will express his determination to the entire cabinet to maintain his position at the cabinet meeting that day and ask for the understanding of the cabinet members, hoping that they will work hard. It is said that the Prime Minister will make inspiring remarks. (Nichi-Rengo telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>Osaka The 18th International Labor Conference, scheduled to be held on June 4, will discuss issues such as shortening working hours and prohibiting women and children from working at night. However, the Japanese government believes that European countries are using these meetings to plot economic warfare against Japan and to pressure the Japanese economy. It is wary of the future of the conference and has stated that it will not hesitate to withdraw from the conference if the situation worsens. Unexpectedly, this statement by the government has aroused opposition from Japanese labor circles. The twelve labor organizations participating in the labor conference held an executive committee meeting on the 23rd of last month, stating that the government's attitude is using industrial nation-building as an excuse to suppress the Japanese labor movement and labor conditions. They also held a committee meeting at 10:00 AM on the 8th and formally decided on the policy of labor representatives, resolving that the poor labor conditions in Japan are a certainty. If the government withdraws from the International Labor Conference, the current labor conditions will worsen. Therefore, this association resolutely opposes Japan's withdrawal from the Labor Conference. (Nichi-Rengo telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The US fleet will depart on April 9, from San Pedro to San Diego, for a transatlantic exercise. Diplomats from various countries here will hold celebrations because this move is actually a friendly gesture towards Japan, sufficient to express the United States' desire to maintain peace in the Pacific. In 1932, the fleet gathered with the battle fleet in San Diego for exercises, appearing on the Pacific Ocean. The fleet also deployed a part of naval aircraft. After the United States recognized Soviet Russia, it formally issued a notice, stating that the fleet would go to the Atlantic for exercises. It was previously rumored that the United States and Russia had discussed the policy of handling the Pacific, conspiring against Japan. The fleet is prepared to return to the Pacific in the autumn, but the US authorities will declare to the world that this exercise will not cause tension in the Pacific. Participating in this exercise are 110 battleships and cruisers, 3,000 officers, and 10,000 soldiers. This large fleet will depart tomorrow, with Admiral Sellers as the commander-in-chief, stationed on the battleship Pennsylvania. The exercise will last until May 31, and will then gather in the Hudson River, at which time President Roosevelt will hold a grand review, and the naval commander-in-chief will also attend. It is learned that the US Navy held a review in December 1918 after the Great War, and President Hoover also held a review in May 1930. This fleet is scheduled to conduct combat exercises when passing through New York on April 19, and will also go to the Panama Canal for an attack, and then return to the aviation base in California. After this exercise, it is heard that Admiral Lefferts will be appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the US Navy, and Sellers will be appointed as the principal of the Naval Academy.

<h3 id="e60">Japan Demands Britain Abolish Singapore Naval Base; If Britain Ignores It, It Will Overthrow Naval Ratio <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>According to the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun on the 5th, the United States' Far East naval policy has recently adopted an aggressive approach. Initially, due to the expansion plan of the Australian naval base, adding the Australian fleet, the next step is the construction of the Singapore naval base. The naval base is scheduled to be completed before the Third Washington Naval Disarmament Conference, in September 1935. If the port is completed, in maritime strategy, it can control the Indian Ocean and the China Sea, and include the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, its value in terms of both offense and defense is greater than the US Pearl Harbor naval base. (From Sasebo, Japan, to Singapore, it is nearly 900 miles closer than Yokosuka to Pearl Harbor.) It poses a great threat to Japan's national defense, and the balance of national defense power between Japan, Britain, and the United States in the Pacific is disrupted, especially undermining Japan's national defense plan at its root. That is, at the 1935 Washington Conference, Japan's sense of security in national defense was greatly hindered. Therefore, the Japanese authorities directly asked the United States to abolish the facilities of the Singapore naval base. The reasons are: (1) The completion of the Singapore naval base, geographically and technically speaking, causes significant anxiety to both Japan and the United States, resulting in the expansion of Japanese and US armaments, violating the spirit of disarmament. (2) The location of the Singapore naval base, according to the Washington Naval Treaty's Pacific defense restriction agreement area, is only five degrees away from 110 degrees east longitude, then the United States has clearly trampled on the spirit of the disarmament treaty. (3) If it is to protect the East Asian trade route, Hong Kong already has sufficient strength, why build a port in Singapore? Based on these three reasons, the United States is asked to abolish it. If the United States ignores it, it will be proposed that the port be included in the Pacific defense restriction agreement area of the London Treaty and subject to defense restrictions. If it is still impossible to implement Japan's主張, then Japan, threatened by the two ports of Pearl Harbor and Singapore, will overthrow the existing ratio of 5:5:3.</p>
<h3 id="e61">China Eastern Railway Business Report, Severely Affected by Military Attacks <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Berkley: Ludi, the director of the China Eastern Railway Bureau, has submitted to the Railway Council the railway's business performance in 1933. The railway has suffered greatly due to military incidents, bandit disturbances, the continuing economic panic, the impact of the 1932 flood, and the unhealthy competition from neighboring governments' railways and waterways. The other side has also taken various administrative measures of a non-economic nature, so business has been greatly hampered. Mr. Lu listed the latter in detail, and pointed out that a total of 11 intentional train destructions occurred throughout the year, 38 armed searches of trains, 39 attempts to destroy trains, 19 fires, 197 attacks and robberies of railway personnel, 60 railway personnel killed, 99 railway personnel injured, and 400 people kidnapped. The revenue and expenditure for the past year totaled 35,873,000 gold rubles in revenue and 23,733,000 gold rubles in expenditure. Of these, expenditures directly related to railway operations were only 16,084,000 gold rubles. The cash balance on January 1 of this year was 7,355,000 gold rubles. The report claimed that if the Japanese military authorities could repay half of their debt to the railway, the cash balance on January 1 would reach 19,095,000 gold rubles. In addition to repaying the entire debt of the China Eastern Railway of 4,838,000 gold rubles, the cash balance could still net 14,257,000 gold rubles. Mr. Ludi said in the final paragraph of the report that although the operating environment was extremely difficult, the performance was still excellent. The reason for this was the frugality in expenditure, the improvement of operations, the reduction of costs, the hardship and heroism of the employees' service, and the unusual stability of the China Eastern Railway, which is the main enterprise in the area and closely related to the economic life of the area.</p>

<p>(Moscow) British-Japanese negotiations have been resumed at the initiative of the British government. The Pravda commented on this, saying that this negotiation is a negotiation between the business community, and is represented by the governments of the two countries. The Pravda then asked, "Do we have any doubts that the government representatives will discuss issues other than trade relations between the two countries? The British press has never concealed this, pointing out that influential figures in the British military and business community all regard the breakdown of the British-Japanese alliance as a terrible mistake, and New Zealand and Australia no longer oppose British-Japanese amity. This shows that the British leadership is preparing to restore the former British-Japanese alliance." The Pravda continued to comment on the British-Japanese negotiations, and expressed its opinion that this move is extremely important politically. This importance is proven by the fact that the problem of resolving economic and trade conflicts between Britain and Japan has been freed from the scope of private initiatives and directly transferred to the hands of the two governments. The report stated that the 1935 naval conference is one of the items on the agenda of this negotiation. At the same time, the press has raised the issue of a far-reaching British-Japanese cooperation. The Pravda said, "What Japanese imperialism demands from Britain is broader and more active assistance to its Far East policy, especially its struggle against the United States. At the same time, British imperialism wants to exert a greater influence on Japanese policy than before. This attempt is manifested by the fact that Britain is arming its military position in the Pacific, in order to allow Britain to 'adjust' Japan's expansionist forces. There is no doubt that this negotiation has enormous potential. At the same time, when these two great imperialist plunderers begin to bargain, it goes without saying that they want to sacrifice a third party to resolve their disputes." (8th TASS)</p>

<p>(Washington) Congress and the industrial sector are gradually showing signs of unease with the policies of the National Recovery Administration, so the authorities are obviously facing increasing difficulties. Today, the US Chamber of Commerce issued an article stating that although there are various signs of recovery, some of the legislative bills that have been passed and are currently under discussion are obstacles to this progress. The legislative bills it refers to are the Securities Exchange Management Act, the bond bill passed last year to protect investors, and the 30-hour weekly work hour bill for various industries. What is most worrying to some Democrats now is the bill proposed by Frazier and Rhenke, advocating the issuance of Federal Reserve notes with an annual interest rate of 1.5%, in order to regulate rural debt financing. House Speaker Rainey pointed out that this bill is sufficient to lead to inflation and can only be compared to Germany's move to suppress the mark in 1923. Senator Glass, who has always criticized President Roosevelt's policies, now also pointed out that this bill is a national disgrace and runs counter to common sense and honesty. It is not certain what kind of action President Roosevelt will take on the above-mentioned proposals, but there is no doubt that Roosevelt will not give up the plan to grant him great power to conclude tariff agreements. However, it is expected that if the President wants to avoid twists and turns, he will definitely sacrifice other plans. (9th Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Austrian-Swiss Merger Movement Still in its Infancy <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Vienna: Austria's neighboring countries are wary of Austria's future, and countries around the world are mostly watching the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy. According to information obtained by the Associated Press, a new movement is now being launched in Austria. This new movement is of paramount importance to Austria's future and has received considerable attention in the political sphere. The significance of the new movement lies in permanently resolving Austria's difficulties. The method used is not to link with Switzerland to form a simple political organization, but to form a federation with Switzerland, so that Austria can be in the same position as Switzerland and enjoy internationally recognized neutrality. Some insist that this new movement is still in its infancy, but if we are not forgetful, we can still recall that six months ago, Austrian Minister for Constitutional Revision, Dr. Schuschnigg, intended to merge Switzerland with the Vorarlberg province. Some consider the current new movement to be a Swiss-Austrian merger movement, and its purpose is only to arouse the attention of the Austrian public. The Associated Press reporter spoke by phone with Governor Nattererb of Bregenz, the capital of Vorarlberg province. Although Nattererb expressed his neutrality, he has confirmed the point that the people of Vorarlberg province tend to support the merger plan, and Nattererb solemnly declared that there is still no organized plan regarding the merger event. Mr. Vorarlberg said, "We are neither left-leaning nor right-leaning. The purpose we have held from beginning to end is to seek Austria's peace. If we cannot complete our ambition to maintain Austria's peace, we may as well discuss the plan for a merger between Austria and Switzerland. However, what Austria is most concerned about is an independent and truly democratic country." When the Associated Press reporter asked Nattererb if his so-called independent and democratic country referred to a political system similar to the Swiss government, Nattererb replied, "Yes," and said that a political system similar to the Swiss government would be most welcomed by the Austrian people. It is thought that the merger of Austria and Switzerland will inevitably affect Austria's constitution, and the recognition of the major powers will also be indispensable. However, supporters of the merger plan firmly believe that the merger of Austria and Switzerland will definitely gain the assistance of Italy, because Italy's desire to maintain Austria's independence is nothing more than to enhance the security of the Iron Curtain border. In addition, France will also be able to treat the merger plan with a friendly attitude and discuss it. The country that opposes the merger plan most vigorously should be Germany, because if Austria and Switzerland merge, it will be tantamount to declaring the death sentence for Germany's ambition to annex Austria.

<p>Dublin: The Free State government has decided to hold local government elections on June 26. As the date approaches, Ireland is showing signs of renewed incidents. The two major parties competing in this election will take this opportunity to compare their strength. Blue Shirts leader General O'Duffy is now trying his best to reform the organization of the Irish United Party across the country and make it perfect, while the President of the Free State is engaged in expanding his dictatorial power. The other day, he prohibited a certain troupe from performing certain plays when it travels to the United States in the future, otherwise the Free State government will stop the subsidies it gives to the troupe. Yesterday, O'Duffy gave a speech in Tullamore criticizing this move, and De Valera also gave a speech to the public in Ghafan, saying that the British will never be able to restore their market in Ireland. Incidents occurred in various places at the end of this week. When members of the Irish United Party held a dance party in Clifden, Galway, someone tried to set fire to the hall. Near Tullamore, someone tried to dismantle a section of the railroad track to prevent supporters of General O'Duffy from participating in a meeting. Also, in Ballymena, Ulster, some masked people carrying weapons broke into the weapons storage of the Special Police, seized several rifles and pistols, and thousands of rounds of ammunition, and fled.

<p>Boston: Bishop Tourian of the Armenian Republic came to New York after the Armenian Republic was established under Soviet Russian protection. He has always advocated being pro-Russian, fearing that he would be hated, and was always accompanied by guards. On December 25 of last year, just as Bishop Tourian was praying at the altar, someone suddenly stepped forward and stabbed him with a butcher knife. Afterwards, Armenians living in the United States blamed each other, leading to party strife. Today, the two factions fought here, wielding knives and axes. Two hundred and fifty policemen urgently carried tear gas to the scene to suppress the crowd and drive them away, arresting nine people. (8th Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e83">The Lantern Festival at Ta'er Monastery in Qinghai. The most sacred place in the monastery is the Jiangkang. It enshrines Tsongkhapa, the leader of the Gelug school. Tsongkhapa's disciples are the Panchen Lamas and Dalai Lamas. Many people come to the monastery every year to pay homage. The Lantern Festival is extremely lively. <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Qinghai Correspondence: Ta'er Monastery in Xining is the birthplace of Tsongkhapa, the founder of Tibetan Buddhism. Every year during the Lantern Festival, Buddhist rituals, scripture readings, and a lantern festival commemorating Tsongkhapa are held. Several days before the main event, monks and laypeople from across the province travel to worship Buddha, creating a vibrant and colorful scene. The current state of the monastery, the history of Tsongkhapa, and the details of this year's scripture readings and lantern festival are described below for the benefit of the nation.</p>
<p>Ta'er Monastery is located in the southern countryside of Xining, only forty li away. Every year, in addition to holding scripture readings and lantern festivals during the Lantern Festival, scripture readings are also held on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month. Although it is a Buddhist gathering, Han and Mongol merchants gather to trade goods several days before the event. The area near the monastery is almost completely filled with people, creating a magnificent spectacle. The architecture of the entire monastery is majestic and magnificent, one of the greatest buildings in Qinghai. There are approximately 3,560 lamas, and their residences are all painted white, surrounding the monastery. The land within a radius of more than 200 li is all managed by the monastery, and the annual income is quite substantial. The rare treasures in the monastery, priceless, are mostly tributes from various places, forming an invisible museum. It is estimated that its real estate alone is worth more than the Boxer Indemnity. Its wealth can be imagined. The most sacred place in the monastery is the Jiangkang, which means the holy mausoleum of Buddhism. The exterior is extremely beautiful, divided into upper and lower levels. The upper level is surrounded by cloth curtains, which are only removed on major commemorative days. Both levels are covered with gold-leaf tiles, and the top level has a beautiful treasure dome made of pure gold, its value incalculable. The portrait and remains of Tsongkhapa, the leader of the Gelug school of Buddhism, are enshrined in the "Jiangkang." Hanging above is a portrait painted by Tsongkhapa himself with his own blood. It is said that when he was preaching in Lhasa, Tibet, because he was separated from his beloved mother, he painted this to give to her as a temporary letter. Tsongkhapa was born in the monastery in the fifteenth year of the Ming Yongle era (i.e., 1417 AD). After his birth, a tree grew on the spot where his mother buried his placenta, and the leaves resembled the shape of the Buddha. People treasured it very much, so Tsongkhapa was also called "Baby Buddha." More than 100 li southeast of the monastery, near the Yellow River, is a monastery called Shachong Temple, where the Baby Buddha cut his hair and practiced devoutly. Shachong Temple is grand in scale, with about a thousand households of monks. It is an important place for trade between the Han and Tibetan people and a center for Buddhist gatherings. Other mountains are steep, and the forests are dense. The mountains resemble lotus platforms, and the forests resemble lotus flowers. Those who travel there are reluctant to leave. After Tsongkhapa practiced in that place, he traveled to various places to study Buddhism at the Saga Monastery in Tashilhunpo in Later Tibet. At that time, monks in various parts of Tibet were given preferential treatment by the court, were corrupt and lewd, unrestrained, did not engage in the proper way, and were superstitious in magic, going deep into wrong paths. Baby Buddha, after becoming alarmed, vowed to reform Buddhism, entered the Great Snow Mountain, and quietly practiced asceticism for more than 20 years. After achieving enlightenment, the Tibetan people greatly believed in him. He established another sect, rejected illusionary arts, forbade marrying wives, and changed to wearing yellow robes. This is the Gelug school of Buddhism, which is different from the old-time devotees who wore red robes. The disciples all understand Mahayana Buddhism, value asceticism, and their learning and conduct are outstanding, surpassing the Red Sect disciples. The Yellow Sect then became popular in Tibet. In the fifteenth year of Ming Chenghua (1479), Baby Buddha passed away. He had two great disciples, one named Panchen Lama and one named Dalai Lama, which translates to "illustrious." It is said that the Dalai Lama is the incarnation of Avalokiteśvara, and the Panchen Lama is the incarnation of Vajrapani. They have already reincarnated in India and are enthroned in Lhasa in Former Tibet and Tashilhunpo in Later Tibet, as the religious leaders of the Yellow Sect. Since Baby Buddha forbade marrying wives, he created a method of succession, saying that although the physical bodies of the Panchen Lama and Dalai Lama die, their spirits still attach to human bodies, and they are never extinguished, appearing in turn as the Khubilhan (meaning incarnation) who controls religious power, etc. This is because the various tribes in northern Mongolia are located in remote areas and cannot personally receive Tsongkhapa. The Jiangkang (commonly known as the Grand Sutra Hall) contains a statue of Tsongkhapa, more than five feet tall, made of pure gold, quite magnificent and solemn. The statue sits on an elaborately constructed treasure seat more than eight feet high. The offerings in front of the statue are all cast in gold and silver. Hundreds of sacred lamps shine brightly before Tsongkhapa, reflecting under his statue, with brilliant light, making people dare not look directly. The wooden plank in front of Tsongkhapa's throne has been rubbed with an inch-deep dent due to the bowing and worship of many believers. It is said that almost every day people come to the monastery from Tibet, Mongolia, Gansu, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan to pay homage. Some even come from thousands of miles away, wearing wooden hand guards and prostrating themselves on the ground to the monastery, showing their sincerity. As for the so-called scripture readings, on the morning of the 28th (fifteenth day of the first lunar month), all the monks in the monastery hold scripture readings, worship dances, and Tibetan music. First, several young monks, wrapped in white cloth, with only their eyes exposed like monkeys, come out to dance. Dozens of monks wear various animal masks, strange costumes, and dance with forks and halberds in their hands, in rhythm with the dance, very much in the style of Western dancing. As for the pilgrims, they must buy a few copper coins worth of butter lamps at the entrance and hold them in their hands, circling several times from left to right, and then return the lamps to their original positions. Some also buy them and light them in front of the Buddha statues. Tens of thousands of people crowd together, extremely tense. The monastery has black-robed lamas who act as temporary police, wielding whips to maintain order. The Lantern Festival that evening is dedicated to commemorating Tsongkhapa, made of countless patterns of butter lamps. The ingenious lamp stands are extremely beautiful and exquisite. The first layer is a panorama of Lhasa in Former Tibet. Below it is a large Buddha statue with hands extended, sitting in meditation, kind and gentle. Other Buddha statues, flowers, landscapes, figures, etc., lifelike, and full of emotion, are arranged around, shining like a painting. The artistic genius of Tibet and the boundlessness of Buddhism inspire awe in visitors. When performing the sacrificial rites of the Lantern Festival, a group of black-robed lamas leads the way, followed by a large group of lamas carrying Tibetan incense and sacrificial objects. Behind them is a lama holding a jade scepter, with two lamas on either side each holding a torch. Behind them is carried the incarnation of Tsongkhapa. The crowd walks to the butter lamp stand and the large Buddha statue, kneeling solemnly and respectfully. After the ceremony is completed, the butter lamps also begin to melt at this time. Tens of thousands of people watch the scene, and the grand ceremony is thus concluded.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Changes in European Diplomacy. Germany Faces Difficulties. Italy's External Expansion. Unemployment Numbers Slightly Reduced. Cash Reserves Shaken. <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>German Correspondence</p>
<p>The meeting of the three dictatorial prime ministers, Mussolini of Italy, Dollfuss of Austria, and Gömbös of Hungary, in Rome is a shock to all of Europe. Because Austria and Hungary, under the so-called treaties of Saint-Germain and Trianon, are dominated by the great powers. Whether in politics or in economics, they seem to have no way out, and can even be said to be unable to find a way out. Originally, Austria's situation and ethnic relations made merging with Germany the most suitable. First, because the National Socialist Party acted too recklessly, it lost the hearts of most Austrians. Second, Italy feared that after the Austro-German merger, the German population would jump from 65 million to 72 million, posing a great threat to Italy. Moreover, German science and technology are no match for them. Not only Italy is wary of this, but France is also very cautious and vigilant. Indeed, if Germany and Austria were to merge, France would use various peace treaties as weapons to oppose it, and would also try to undermine any attempt to win over Austria and Hungary. However, they are in agreement on restricting Germany's development, so they tacitly acknowledge the actions of Italy, Austria, and Hungary without immediately taking active measures to contain them. Germany, at this time, if it does not receive solid political assistance, will not act rashly.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of economics, it also has internal weaknesses. For example, the unemployment problem. Since the National Socialist Party came to power in January last year, improving the unemployment situation has been its main claim. Since then, according to surveys by labor exchanges, the number of unemployed workers at the end of February last year was more than 6,014,000, and thereafter gradually decreased. However, that kind of decrease contains a very strong seasonal relationship. Because in the summer, after the rise of summer resorts and other temporary businesses, many workers will always be attracted to work. By December of last year, it had increased again. Has Germany's unemployment situation improved after all? According to the report of the German Institute for Economic Research, there were 1.5 million unregistered unemployed workers from the spring to autumn of 1931, and now there are 2 million unregistered unemployed workers. The number of unemployed workers in the winter of last year decreased by more than 1,640,000 compared with the winter of the previous year, while the number of newly employed people increased by only 1,321,000 during the same period. Now, regarding the employment situation of German workers and the unemployment situation, according to the statistics of the German Institute for Economic Research, the table is copied below:</p>
<p>Table of the Number of Unemployed Workers and Employed Workers in Germany (in thousands of people)</p>
<p>November 1933 November 1932</p>
<p>Number of Employed People 14,020 12,699</p>
<p>Number of Registered Unemployed People 3,715 5,355</p>
<p>At least 500,000 to 600,000 unregistered unemployed workers must be added here. What kind of results can the German government achieve with its desperate efforts? Or, after spring goes and summer comes, will there be a seasonal turn for the better as usual?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Germany's international income and expenditure has no overseas investment, and even the income from shipping is very limited, almost negligible. Therefore, it can only rely on trade exports exceeding imports to compensate. However, since the beginning of this year, foreign trade in January and February has suddenly turned to import surpluses. Compared with February of last year, imports increased from 71.5 million marks to 75.9 million marks, while exports decreased from 76.4 million marks to 69.3 million marks. That is, a surplus of 4.9 million marks in exports has turned into a surplus of 6.6 million marks in imports. What a dangerous thing this is. To this end, the German government decided in mid-February to manage foreign exchange, requiring that the purchase of imported goods should not exceed 50% of exports. In March, it was decided to be 45%. Moreover, the cash reserve for convertible notes of the German Reichsbank is only 26.2 million marks, with a reserve ratio of only 8% for 330 million convertible notes. Germany's current economic crisis is no less than its diplomatic plight. (March 9, 1934, in Berlin)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Sun's Troops Near Completion of Reorganization. Men Bingyue Returns to Beiping to Report to He. Sui Army Encircles and Suppresses Yang Hou's Small Bandit Unit. <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The reorganization of Sun Dianying's troops is, in general, nearing completion. Men Bingyue, who previously traveled with Fu Zuoyi from Beiping as a representative of the Military Affairs Commission to coordinate all military matters, because the war has ended, needs to return to Beiping to report to He Yingqin regarding the disbandment of Sun's troops and all the events that occurred during the campaign. Therefore, on the 6th, he took the express train on the Ping-Sui Railway and returned to Beiping. After getting off the train, he immediately reported to He. According to Men, the situation of Sun's troops is roughly as follows: "The disarmament, carried out by the Jin-Sui army, has now been fully completed. A total of 12,300 rifles have been obtained, and the number of officers and soldiers has reached 28,000. They are all being housed by the Jin-Sui army in camps set up in the San Shenggong area, and transported to Baotou in batches, and then transported to Hebei. This unit is still commanded by Sun's original regimental commanders Yu Shiming, Liu Yueting, Lu Fengnian, etc. Yu's unit has already advanced towards Linhe. Yu personally arrived in Linhe on the 2nd to meet Commander-in-Chief Fu and ask for instructions on everything. Lu Fengnian and Liu Yueting will also go to Lin to meet Fu and ask for instructions. Sun's troops suffered heavy losses in this operation, especially Liu Yueting's. Liu's unit will be stationed in Dengkou in the future, while Yu and Lu's units will enter Hebei. Those near Ningxia, such as Ding Futing, Yang Ganqing, and Xia Weili, total two brigades. Except for a small part waiting to be reorganized in the suburbs of Ningxia, the majority are still coming north to merge with Yu and Liu. Xia Weili's unit will arrive soon. Sun's troops have been in a state of supply difficulties for more than three months. Their embarrassed state is unprecedented. After disarming, the Jin-Sui army treated them extremely well, so they all felt like they had gone from hell to heaven. Yang Hou, a bandit accumulated in western Sui, knows that the authorities will never tolerate him, so when Sun's army failed, he detoured around western He and fled eastward along the Yin Mountains. He has now fled to the territory of Wuchuan County. That area is slightly north, that is, the League Banner area, which is very close to the provincial capital. The Suiyuan army has already encircled from all sides. The bandits have nearly 2,000 rifles. The Jin-Sui army is very experienced in suppressing bandits, so it should be easy to eliminate this bandit." Tao Jun, Wang Zhongquan, Zhang Xuanze, etc., who were sent by the Military Affairs Commission to monitor the reorganization of Sun's troops, are in the gathering places of Sun's troops, assisting the Jin-Sui army in handling everything. Relay stations have been set up along the way to provide for Sun's troops. "Whether I still need to return west must await the decision of Chairman He," he said. The Suiyuan Provincial Party Department, with spring plowing imminent, has telegraphed to the central government and the Military Affairs Commission requesting the prompt return of the 410,000 yuan that the people of the counties of Wuyuan, Linhe, Baotou, Anbei, etc., in western Sui not only had all their private savings taken away by Sun's army, but also advanced in cash to purchase military supplies for Sun, because if the government does not return the money immediately, it will be difficult for the people of those counties to survive, so they hope that spring plowing can be expected.

<p>On the 7th, the Wuxi ship, owned by Hua Kai of the ninth district, arrived at Lujiaqiao at around 7 PM. Suddenly, four bandits disguised as passengers were discovered by the shipowner, Lin Senquan, who secretly reported it to the local defense corps. Instructor Xu Sheng was dispatched with corps members to inspect. Unexpectedly, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. The bullets struck corps member Wang Genyuan in the face, causing his teeth to fall out, and injured passenger Wang Hongbao in the shoulder and local resident Hou Sanbao in the abdomen, killing him instantly. The injured were sent to Shuzi Hospital for treatment. Seeing they were outnumbered, the bandits fled into the water. Corps members bravely chased them for about a mile, and bandit Zhao Dabao was shot in the leg and captured. Two other bandits, Duan Xiaoquan and Jiang Weixin (both from Tongshan County), were also arrested and taken to the corps headquarters. They confessed to plotting to rob the ship without denying it. Today (the 8th), they were handed over to the county for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Zhang Xiting, a resident of Xiaomatou, using the alias Liu Lansen, colluded with Li Peigen of Liu Li Lane, using the alias Liu Rentao, and Chen Yeru, along with the fugitive Wu Shaoquan, forged court documents under the pretense of investigating opium cases, defrauding wealthy opium addicts in both urban and rural areas, and not just once. Later, they attempted to defraud Zhao Jinjiang, the manager of Hengkang Pawnshop in Gaozi Town, but were exposed by the victim, who telegraphed the local court to inquire about the alleged investigation of opium cases. He received a reply instructing the arrest of Zhang Xiting and others impersonating court police and their transfer to the court. After multiple interrogations, it was learned that prosecutor Li Weishen had concluded the investigation and indicted the defendants for forging official documents. Judge Gu of the criminal court presided over the trial and sentenced Zhang Xiting and the other two to seven years of imprisonment.</p>

<p>Wangyang Village in the tenth district is still in the reclamation and freshwater storage stage. The villagers rely solely on the annual cotton harvest for their livelihood. Last autumn's tidal disaster completely submerged the cotton fields, resulting in no income at all, and the disaster situation is severe. Although the county relief association has provided relief once, it is like a drop in the bucket, insufficient to solve the problem. Currently, during the spring famine, there is a shortage of food. The disaster victims are subsisting on green grass and chaff every day, which is extremely miserable. Yesterday, they specifically sent representatives to the relief association to appeal for immediate relief.</p>

<p>American aviator Major Hawks, accompanied by pilot Gore, brought the Condor, a giant military-commercial dual-use aircraft, to China for demonstrations. After arriving in Shanghai, the aircraft parts were transported to Hangzhou for assembly. The entire assembly was completed a few days ago. After several successful test flights in Hangzhou, he flew the aircraft to Shanghai on the 7th. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, he conducted a test flight at Longhua Airport and invited Chinese and Western guests to ride on a flight around the city. The details are recorded below:</p>

<p>The Condor aircraft is painted entirely in tile gray, with the Kuomintang emblem of a white sun on a blue sky painted on the underside of both wings. The aircraft is equipped with a 700-horsepower engine on each side. The aircraft's nose and fuselage are surrounded by circular windows for observation. There is a small door on the left side of the fuselage for passengers to enter and exit. There are two pilot seats in the front of the nose. The center seats on both sides can accommodate 24 to 30 passengers, making the fuselage quite large.</p>

<p>At 2:30 PM, about a hundred Chinese and Western reporters and American men and women arrived at Longhua Airport. They were greeted and boarded by Pan Lai, the Chinese manager of Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Factory. Due to the large number of people, the flights were divided into four trips. Each time, Major Hawks accompanied by pilot Gore flew around the city and Pudong, taking about 30 minutes before safely landing. Although the aircraft's fuselage is large, it flies very stably in the air. Reporters sitting inside did not experience any bumps. Therefore, all the Chinese and Western guests who rode the aircraft yesterday praised the aircraft for its meticulous and great equipment. The guests finally dispersed at 4:15 PM.</p>

<p>The Chinese Aviation Association, in order to popularize civilian aviation and encourage the public's interest in flying, specially invited well-known figures in the aviation industry at home and abroad to jointly initiate the organization of a flying club as a place for people to study and learn flying skills. A few months ago, the association drafted a plan outline and Secretary-General Lin Wojiang made a special trip to Beijing to present it to various central agencies for approval. The preparatory office of the association was also established on the 18th of last month during the naming ceremony of the Tianchu aircraft to make active preparations so that it can be completed as soon as possible. Recently, Lin Wojiang went to Hangzhou again to contact the Aviation Department and get military approval.</p>

<p>After Lin returned to Shanghai, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited him yesterday morning. According to him, the association received a reply from Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission yesterday, roughly saying that our country has repeatedly suffered painful lessons and deeply feels the urgency of aviation needs. It is appropriate to approve the establishment of the association's ability to understand this purpose and advocate for the public, and to express encouragement and commendation. After receiving this reply, the association immediately sent letters to all promoters to schedule an inaugural meeting to jointly discuss the steps and work policies to be taken. Therefore, the Flying Club can be formally established in a very short period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Foreign News: A Brief Biography of General von Seeckt <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>According to Lin Bao, General von Seeckt, the leader of the German Army during the European War and the man in charge of reorganizing the German Army after the armistice, arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the P&amp;O liner Naldera for his second visit to China. His wife also accompanied him. The purpose of this trip has not been revealed. It is currently believed that he will enter Beijing in the coming days to hold talks with the Chinese authorities. The general first came to China last spring, when he served as a consultant to the Chinese government on the reorganization of the army, but this plan was never implemented. The general is now sixty-six years old, comes from a military family, and served as a lieutenant colonel in the army at the beginning of the European War before being promoted to chief of staff of the army commanded by General Mackensen. He then served as chief of staff of the Turkish Army in the war zone. General Mackensen's army intercepted the Russian army's line of defense in the Gorlice area, thus capturing major cities such as Warsaw. This was the result of the general's strategy. He then served in Siberia and Russia as chief of staff of the army commanded by Archduke Charles, suppressing the offensive of General Brusilov. After the armistice in 1918, he participated in the peace negotiations and was then ordered to reorganize the German Army on a non-political basis. This was a difficult task, and the new German military system was created by him. The general then served as commander-in-chief of the German Army until 1926, when he retired. The general wrote a book about his experiences at the peace conference called "Thoughts of a Soldier," which was translated into English several years ago. In the book, he warned that inequality in military strength would cause various harms and could easily lead to war. The general is fond of traveling and has traveled throughout Europe and to several countries in the East. He is particularly interested in India and spent many days there on this trip before boarding the Columbus-class Naldera to China.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Ruling on the Collision Between the Wanshang and Luan Ships: The Wanshang Was Not at Fault; The Luan Was Responsible <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>On December 12th of last year, the Sanbei Company's Wanshang ship was sailing upstream to Wuhan. It was at night when it reached the vicinity of Fishing Island in Qizhou, upstream of Jiujiang. As the Wanshang was sailing upstream, the Bao Yuan Company's Luan ship, managed by the Jianghan ship of the Wuhan Recruitment Committee and carrying 220 new recruits, was traveling in the opposite direction to Xun. Each ship sounded horns, but collision was inevitable and the Luan ship was hit and immediately sank. All 220 new recruits fell into the water. The Wanshang immediately stopped to help rescue and carried them back to Hankou. As a result, 78 soldiers died. The Wanshang was detained in Hankou for one day and released the next day. The captain of the Wanshang was Weng Ziqing, who was temporarily assigned to the shift by the Qingpu shipowner. Cao Renyu and Yan Weijin were on duty as second officers when the accident occurred, and Xiao Yanqing was on duty as the officer on the Luan ship. An investigation was conducted.</p>
<p>Because the case was of great importance, the Wuhan military authorities, together with the Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau and the owners of the Sanbei and Bao Yuan ships, hired experts in the navigation industry to conduct an arbitration. Before the arbitration, seven impartial personnel recommended by each party went to the Fishing Island area to conduct an on-site investigation and collect testimonies and physical evidence. From mid-January to early February, each impartial person spent half a month investigating to clarify the situation. In mid-February, an arbitration tribunal was established to summon the crew members on duty from both ships and witnesses to take statements as the basis for determining the right and wrong of the case.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Setting up an Arbitration Tribunal <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The arbitration tribunal was set up in the Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau. The arbitration committee consisted of Zhang Xiunan, Director of the Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau, the head of the Third Section of the bureau, the head of the examination section, the executive committee of the Hankou Shipping Association, and representatives of the Insurance Association. There were also Captain Huang Yushi of the China Merchants Bureau's Jianguo ship and Captain Zheng Dingxi of the Sanbei Changxing ship. From February 15th, Weng Ziqing, Cao Renyu, Yan Weijin, Xiao Yanqing, etc. were summoned to inquire about the sailing conditions of the two ships at the time, the navigation regulations, and the circumstances of the collision. The investigation continued on the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 21st, and witnesses Zhu Kaolan and Fang Zhiping were also summoned. The Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs was also invited to court to present his opinions. The Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Communications both attached great importance to this case and sent a representative each to participate in the public trial. The Ministry of Communications appointed Shen Jiyun, the chief shipowner of the China Merchants Bureau, as the chief judge of the committee.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Arbitration Decision <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After a long period of investigation and interrogation, each arbitrator compiled their opinions and submitted them to Shen Jiyun, who drafted the judgment of the case. It has now been completed, running to tens of thousands of words, detailing the navigation process of the case and attaching legal theories, which is very detailed. The main text states that the Sanbei Wanshang ship collided with the Bao Yuan Company's Luan ship at Fishing Island on December 12th, resulting in the drowning of 78 soldiers, and the responsibility for this incident rests with the Bao An Company's Luan ship.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Eight Reasons <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The judgment elaborates on the reasons why the Luan ship should be held responsible for this tragedy, totaling eight reasons. The original text is very long, but briefly, when the Luan ship met the Wanshang ship, the red and green lights of the Luan ship appeared alternately. The Wanshang first sounded its whistle once, and the Luan ship responded with two sounds. When it wanted to give way, the Wanshang had already reached the left side of the Fishing Island lighthouse and could no longer give way. It immediately slowed down. The Luan ship showed its green light and sounded its whistle twice, indicating that it was giving way to the right. The Wanshang was deep in the water and had no place to give way, so it sounded its whistle twice and ordered a full port rudder, giving way to the left. Unexpectedly, the bow moved to the left, and the Luan ship suddenly showed its red light. The Wanshang quickly went into full reverse, but in less than a minute, the two ships collided, and the Luan ship immediately sank. This is the first. The Luan ship's crew had poor piloting skills, the rudder was not flexible, and there was no compass on board for long-distance night navigation. Other technical details about navigation are omitted.</p>

<p>This judgment has been stamped with the names of each arbitrator and signed, and has been handed over to Huang Yushi, who is in charge of the case, to be taken to Hankou. It will be announced in both Shanghai and Hankou today, and this tragedy will be resolved. Since the Luan ship sank, all losses should be borne by its shipowner, Bao Yuan Company, and the Sanbei Company is not involved.</p>

<p>Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce, and Guo Shun, Chairman of the China General Federation of Industry and Commerce, considered that the delegation's mission to attend the 18th International Labor Conference was very important for domestic labor and capital. In order to exchange opinions on all aspects of attending the National Labor Conference, they specially hosted a farewell banquet at Yiyou Society, No. 9 Sanma Road, at 12 PM yesterday afternoon, and invited leaders from the industrial and commercial circles to participate as guests. Government representative Li Pingheng, capital representative Wang Zhisheng, labor representative An Futing, consultant Bao Huaguo, and leaders from the industrial and commercial circles Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Wu Zhihao, Hu Xiyuan, Qian Chengxu, Zhu Xuefan, Li Chengxiang, and others attended.

<h3 id="e119">Summary of Speeches <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>At yesterday's banquet, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech, stating that the current International Labor Conference is about to be held, and your delegation is scheduled to depart tomorrow morning. Considering the responsibilities of each representative, it is very important.

On behalf of the two organizations, I wish Director Li and others success in their efforts, and achieve the goal of improving the domestic labor and capital situation and striving for the position of international labor and capital.</p>
<p>Government representative Director Li Pingheng replied, stating that we are honored to be ordered to attend the 18th International Labor Conference, and we are grateful for the sincere send-off from the National Chamber of Commerce and the China General Federation of Industry and Commerce. Since the establishment of the International Labor Conference in 1919, China has had proposals at each session. The current proposal concerns the issue of factory inspection. Although preparations have been made, the resolutions of previous sessions do not take effect immediately, so whether to submit it is not yet fixed, but at least a report will be submitted to attract the attention of representatives from various countries. We will certainly uphold the government's mission and do our best to fulfill our responsibilities. Labor representative An Futing and Wang Xiaolai also gave brief speeches.</p>

<p>According to representative Li Pingheng, he told a reporter from the Ribao News Agency before his departure that in addition to attending the Labor Conference, he must also go to industrial developed countries such as Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and the United States after the meeting to inspect the industrial and labor conditions. Under the current domestic industrial conditions, there are many things that need to be learned from factory equipment and all matters related to industry. At the same time, the labor insurance law is also quite complicated in our country. The government has long wanted to seek reform, so this time he took the opportunity to attend the National Labor Conference and went to various countries to conduct inspections, so that the results of the inspections can be used as the basis for reform. The inspection period is five to six months.</p>

<p>The first anniversary commemoration of Mr. Liang Shiyi's death was held at the Bankers' Association at 5 PM yesterday. Many people from all walks of life attended. In the area of transportation, there were Ye Gongchuo, Zheng Hongnian, Zhong Wenyao, etc. In the area of banking, there were Hu Mengjia, Lu Xuepu, Feng Gengguang, Wu Dingchang, etc. In the area of industry, there were Lin Kanghou, Lin Zhenyao, Chen Huanzhi, etc. In the area of education, there were Dong Renjian, Liao Maoru, Lu Dingkui, etc. Ye Gongchuo was publicly elected as the chief priest, and Liang's sons, Ding Shu and Ding Min, expressed their gratitude. After the public sacrifice, Lu Xuepu, the representative of the Memorial Affairs Preparatory Committee, reported on the progress of the preparatory scholarship fund. Then, Lin Zhenyao, the representative of the Academic Award Committee, reported on the academic achievements of the scholarship students. Ye Gongchuo, the representative of the Editorial Committee of the Collected Works, reported on the recent situation of the compilation of the Collected Works. Afterwards, Zheng Hongnian gave a speech, stating that Liang had participated in the revolution and expressed his belief to Empress Dowager Longyu about the surrender of the country. In addition, he described Liang's opposition to Hongxian's claim to the throne at that time. Subsequently, Lu Xuepu gave a speech, describing Liang's creation and management of the Three-Four Year Public Bonds and the establishment of the Stock Exchange. Finally, Ye Gongchuo gave a speech, describing Liang's achievements in managing transportation affairs, especially the recovery of rights and the development of the national economy, which are still regarded as the guiding principles for transportation managers. The former is exemplified by the recovery of the sovereignty of the Shanghai-Nanjing (Beijing-Shanghai) Road General Administration and the redemption of the entire Beijing-Hankou (Pinghan) Road. The latter is exemplified by the transportation of Mongolian tea to Russia via the Pinghan Road. The difficulties in dealing with these matters were often unknown to the Chinese people. He recalled that after the redemption of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the Qing court only replied with the three words "I know." Thinking about it now, it is truly regrettable. Liang did not care about praise or criticism in his life, and this is one aspect of it. After the meeting, the Academic Award Committee continued to meet to plan which schools and departments should be awarded scholarships for this year's examinations.</p>

<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, the Ministry of Railways has borrowed 40 million pounds sterling from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors to complete the Longhai and Yuehan Railways. After repeated meetings and investigations by the association, it has long been decided to divide the funds into cash, the material funds of the London Purchasing Committee (that is, using railway materials in lieu of cash), and a portion of public bonds, totaling 40 million pounds sterling. A contract has been signed in Beijing. It is now known that the portion of the loan for issuing public bonds, with an amount of 1.6 million pounds sterling, is being mortgaged by the Ministry of Railways to several large Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai, such as the China Central Transportation and HSBC, for 1.5 million pounds sterling, which is approximately 35 million yuan in national currency. It is expected that this will soon become a reality.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Caseleigh, a foreigner involved in this matter, yesterday morning. Mr. Caseleigh admitted the matter and said that the amount of the loan was 1.5 million pounds sterling, but it is still under negotiation and has not been formally decided. It will probably have to go through considerable consultation. As for the interest rate and repayment methods, etc., because it has not been completely decided, the details are still unknown after many inquiries.</p>

<p>Far East Games Standing Committee Continues Informal Meeting Japan Actually Proposes Performance by Puppet Organization Chinese Representatives Cao and Shen Refute with Reason No Need for Further Discussions at Cathay Hotel This Morning Public Sentiment Has Not Died, Should be Firmly Resisted</p>
<p>The long-awaited Standing Committee meeting of the three countries (China, Japan, and the Philippines) for this year's Far Eastern Games was held yesterday at the office of the Shanghai Football Field on Jiaozhou Road. From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, the five agenda items were discussed and completed. In the afternoon, at 2:30 PM, an informal meeting continued, and the Japanese representative actually proposed the issue of a puppet organization participating in a performance. Our representatives immediately and vehemently refuted this. The Japanese representative then directly suggested to the chairman, Dr. Tambuatting of the Philippines, that before discussing this issue, the representatives of each country should be given ample time for consideration, and requested that the meeting be postponed until 9:15 AM tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning) at the Cathay Hotel. The chairman agreed. Thus, the issue of this puppet organization's participation, which is being watched by all, has been formally raised in the three-nation Standing Committee meeting, and our side will participate in the discussion this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives of the Three Countries Attend the Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday at 10:00 AM, representatives of the three countries arrived one after another and convened the Standing Committee meeting at the office of the Shanghai Football Field. The attendees included Dr. Tambuatting from the Philippines, Yamamoto and Matsuzawa from Japan, and Gan Seimo, the Japanese Consul in Shanghai. The Chinese representatives were Cao Yunxiang (representing Vice President Wang Zhengting of the General Assembly) and Shen Siliang, a key member of the Sports Advancement Association. At that time, reporters from both Chinese and Japanese newspapers flocked to gather news, and the situation was quite serious.</p>
<p>Cao's Remarks During Break</p>
<p>After the meeting began, Dr. Tambuatting of the Philippines served as chairman, and Zhou Jiaqi recorded the minutes. After the representatives took their seats, Chinese and Japanese photographers released flashbulbs in the room before moving outside. Then, the discussion of the five agenda items began. There was not much dispute from any side, and the meeting proceeded smoothly. At 11:15 AM, a temporary recess was announced, and the representatives went outside to stroll. Our reporter met with our representative, Mr. Cao Yunxiang, and inquired about the content of the morning's discussion. According to him, the morning's discussion focused on the various agenda items, which could all be completed today. As for the issue of the puppet organization's participation, the Japanese side had not yet raised it. Mr. Wang Zhengting was unable to come south to attend today's meeting due to official duties. It has always been customary for the three countries' Standing Committee meeting to be held before the General Assembly. The idea of a round table conference is a deliberate attempt to mislead, and our country should not be taken advantage of. When asked what attitude our representatives would take if the Japanese side raised the issue of the puppet organization, Mr. Cao replied that discussion is always possible, but our country's firm rejection has been repeatedly declared at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Informal Meeting: Japan Proposes Manchukuo</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the representatives gathered at the original location. Since all five agenda items had been completed, there was no need for further discussion, and an informal meeting was convened. Dr. Tambuatting of the Philippines remained as chairman. As soon as the meeting began, the Japanese representative Yamamoto raised the issue of the puppet organization's participation. His reason was based on the precedent of allowing India to participate in the performance at the 9th Far Eastern Games held in Tokyo in 1930. He repeatedly reiterated this and cited the General Assembly's regulations, distorting the reasons he held between the words and sentences of the charter. Yamamoto also stated that the puppet organization was requesting to participate in the performance and was not requesting to join as a member. Joining as a member requires the consent of all member countries. Yamamoto's words flowed incessantly, and after our representatives vehemently refuted this, the Japanese side continued to argue incessantly.</p>

<p>Educational News from Other Regions</p>
<p>Guangxi Education Director Lei Binnan Travels to Nanjing Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Lei Binnan, Director of Education of Guangxi Province, has returned to Shanghai for personal matters for several days. Mr. Lei took a train to Nanjing yesterday morning to meet with the Minister of Education. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in two or three days and then return to Guangxi.</p>
<p>Five Resolutions Passed, Two Countries Join, Ten-Minute Break</p>
<p>After a ten-minute break, they returned to the room and continued the discussion. By 12:40 PM, all five agenda items had been resolved, and the morning meeting came to an end. The representatives shook hands and dispersed. The five resolutions passed in the morning were officially announced by the Sports Advancement Association yesterday:</p>
<p>(1) The motion to admit the Dutch East Indies and Annam as formal members was passed.</p>
<p>(2) The motion to abolish the overall championship trophy was passed. The original prize will be handled by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>(3) The motion to change the women's netball performance to a formal championship event was passed. Due to the limited preparation time for all parties, it has been decided that it cannot be implemented this year and will be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>(4) The motion to hire foreign personnel to serve as track and field and swimming referees was submitted to the Competition Committee for discussion, and a request was made to stipulate its adoption method.</p>
<p>(5) The motion to increase the number of registered soccer and basketball teams participating in this General Assembly was passed (soccer: 17 people, basketball: 12 people).</p>
<p>Yamamoto Suggests Postponement to This Morning</p>
<p>Finally, Yamamoto rose and suggested to the chairman, Dr. Tambuatting of the Philippines, that this issue was unusually complex, and each country had considerable opinions. Therefore, before discussing this issue, the representatives of each country should be given ample time for consideration, and requested that the meeting be postponed until 9:15 AM tomorrow morning (i.e., today) at the Cathay Hotel for continuation. The chairman agreed, and the Chinese representatives had no objection. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Meeting Location: Cathay Hotel</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Sports Advancement Association announced last night that at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, at the original site of the informal meeting, the Japanese representative proposed, based on the precedent of India participating in the competition in 1930, discussing the issue of the puppet Manchuria participating in the performance (not the issue of joining as a member), and suggested to the chairman that before discussing this issue, the representatives of each country should be given ample time for consideration. Therefore, it was decided to reschedule the meeting to 9:15 AM today (the 10th) at the Cathay Hotel. Yesterday afternoon's meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Japan's Attitude is Aggressively Conservative</p>
<p>According to sources from the Japanese side, the Japanese side's proposal for the puppet organization to join the performance as a non-member already represents a concession. The Japanese sports world is divided into two factions on this issue: the aggressive and the conservative. The aggressive faction believes that if China does not recognize Manchuria's participation, a separate Far East Games should be convened. The conservative faction believes that this point involves political issues and is not of great value, and that Japan does not want to withdraw. Therefore, the future of this Far East Games depends on whether the Japanese can abandon their conspiracy. According to Professor Tambuatting, the Philippine representative, he told reporters that he had no opinion on the issue of the puppet organization's participation, but that he hoped everyone would be satisfied so that the future of this Far East Games would be bright and happy. He is preparing to return to the Philippines on the Asia Queen.</p>
<p>Respectfully inform our national representatives: The puppet organization's participation in the performance should be resolutely refused for discussion.</p>
<p>On the issue of the puppet organization's participation in the Far Eastern Games, our country, from the government to the people, has unanimously expressed a firm rejection. Overseas Chinese everywhere have also sent telegrams calling for it, and emotions are extremely high. Mr. Wang Zhengting and the authorities of the Sports Advancement Association have successively stated that they would rather be shattered jade than a whole tile, and that if the puppet organization participates in the General Assembly, they would withdraw immediately without hesitation. Yesterday, the Standing Committee meeting of the three countries (China, Japan, and the Philippines) opened in Shanghai. In the morning, all five agenda items were completed, and the task of the meeting was declared over. However, in the afternoon, a so-called informal meeting was suddenly convened. Our representatives did not object in advance, and after the Japanese side raised the issue of the puppet organization's participation, they allowed them to suggest to the chairman to allow them to postpone the meeting until this morning, which was already the first mistake, unknowingly falling into the Japanese side's meticulously arranged maze. The continuing meeting this morning is to discuss the entire issue of the puppet organization's participation, which is very clear. The Northeast is part of our country's territory and has no so-called special organization, let alone a nation. No matter which article in the charter the Japanese representative Yamamoto cites, it is absolutely not a reason. As for the precedent of India, it absolutely cannot be used for the puppet organization. In our opinion, since the agenda has been fully discussed and completed, there should be no more informal meetings, so that the Japanese side can easily raise this issue. Once they raise it, we should resolutely refuse to discuss it, and finally, we should not hesitate to withdraw from the meeting to conform to the spirit of unwavering determination repeatedly expressed by Mr. Wang Zhengting and other sports authorities. Instead of doing this, they agreed to continue participating in this morning's discussion. We sincerely hope that our representatives will uphold the personality of our nation and country, and it may not be too late to mend the fold after a sheep is lost. We respectfully wish you to use the most courageous spirit to resolutely refuse to discuss it and not fall for the other party's cunning schemes again.</p>
<p>Shanghai Journalists Association Warns Two Representatives This Morning's Informal Meeting Should Refuse Attendance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association sent a letter to our country's representatives, Zeng Yunxiang and Shen Siliang, last night, saying: "To the esteemed Yunxiang and Siliang, We have just learned that after the formal Standing Committee meeting of the Far Eastern Games, which was convened in Shanghai yesterday, an informal meeting was suddenly convened to discuss the issue of the puppet organization's participation raised by the Japanese side. This is an unnecessary complication and is deeply shocking. Your tasks are completed, and there is no reason to attend. Our association convened an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee late last night and resolved to ask you to refuse to attend this morning's informal meeting to avoid making one mistake after another. We hereby inform you, and we hope you will cherish the country. The Shanghai Journalists Association, April 9th."</p>

<h3 id="e141">Chen Diaoyuan Advances to Suppress Fang Zhimin's Bandits 丨Chen Has Led Troops to Anhui to Supervise Suppression丨 <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: In order to increase the bandit suppression forces in the five provinces and to eliminate the bandit Fang Zhimin's band in the border areas of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui within a limited time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially requested the central government to appoint Chen Diaoyuan as the Commander-in-Chief of the Reserve Army for the Suppression of Communists in the Five Provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei. After Chen officially took office on the first of this month, he discussed with Chairman Chiang a plan to eliminate the communist bandits in the border areas of northeastern Jiangxi, southwestern Zhejiang, and southeastern Anhui. Chen then led the headquarters of the Reserve Army and the First Route headquarters yesterday to Wuyuan to command the suppression. According to investigations, Fang Zhimin, a communist bandit in eastern Jiangxi, started his rebellion in 1927 with only a few defeated rifles and spears in the border area of Yiheng and Gui. Due to the incompetence of the stationed troops and local governments, he grew stronger day by day. By 1931, his fake Tenth Army commander Zhou Jianping had only nine companies of basic bandit troops. In 1932, Fang's bandits crossed the Xin River from southern Henan, passed through Shangqing Palace in Guixi, and joined forces with Peng's bandits who came east from southern Jiangxi. They also united with Zhu Mao's forces in southeastern Jiangxi. The puppet central government then appointed Fang as the commander-in-chief of the Seventh Army Corps, allocated weapons, and expanded his band into the 19th, 20th, 21st, and 3rd Armies. At the same time, two puppet military regions were established: Xiao Jingguang was appointed commander of the puppet Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Fujian Military Region, and Tang Yangan was appointed commander of the puppet Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Anhui Military Region. They recruited bandits in Guangxin counties and the border areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and established so-called puppet independent regiments. Since then, the communist bandits in the border areas of Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui have become like a long snake, fleeing from one place to another, and the border counties of the four provinces have been unable to rest easy. Recently, Fang's bandits have been using Hengfeng as their base. The puppet Northeast Revolutionary Committee, the puppet army corps headquarters, and all reactionary organizations are located there. Their bandit forces use Dexing and Hengfeng as their rear, the border area between Jiangxi and Fujian as their development area, and the border area between Zhejiang and Anhui as their guerrilla zone. Moreover, Fang's bandits regard Zhejiang as a wealthy area and frequently invade areas such as Suian, Kaihua, Jiangshan, and Changshan, resembling the early days of the bandit disaster in eastern Jiangxi in 1927 and 1928. The counties of Chong'an, Pucheng, and Guangze in northern Fujian are almost like the period of 1927 and 1928. Shangrao, Guixi, and Qianshan in eastern Jiangxi have become the lairs of these bandits. This time, Chairman Chiang has set a deadline for the elimination of communist bandits in various provinces. Large armies from the east, west, north and south are surrounding Zhu Mao in the Jiangxi-Fujian border area, and He Jian is responsible for suppressing Xiao Ke and Kong Hechong in western Jiangxi. Therefore, Chen Diaoyuan is responsible for eliminating Fang's bandits. At this moment, a large number of fresh troops have been transferred to the borders of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Anhui, and they will unite to encircle and suppress the bandits, aiming to eradicate them as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e142">Kailuan Coal Mine Strike Eases - The Process of Workers Surrounding the Commissioner's Office - Hebei Provincial Government Sets Three-Day Deadline for Resolution <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Tangshan coal mine strike became tense when the Huaxin and Qixin strikes occurred. When the Huaxin workers were reinstated after the factory manager and officials worked together to mediate, the Qixin strike, when it first occurred, was handled well by the company and nipped in the bud. Only the Tangshan miners remained, the mine refusing to accept their conditions, work could not resume, and thus trouble arose. Now Zhao Dazhong has gradually lost the general faith of the workers, so the majority of the workers are urgently seeking to resume work to avoid financial difficulties, resulting in the act of surrounding the Commissioner's Office on April 3 to demand recognition of the conditions. Before the workers actually surrounded the office that day, Zhao Dazhong first went to the Commissioner's Office to meet with Tao Shangming, Zhao Xun, and Li Yinchun, the inspector stationed at the factory by the Hebei Construction Department, to request a response to the previously proposed conditions. After two hours of talks, no results were achieved. The workers waited for Zhao Dazhong at the Xuzhou Guild Hall, and seeing that Zhao had been gone for a long time and had not returned, they formed a team to go to the Commissioner's Office, claiming that they would not disperse if the conditions were not recognized. Initially, there were three to four hundred workers, but later it gradually gathered to six to seven hundred, blocking traffic. The workers also frequently chanted slogans. Zhao Dazhong then left the Commissioner's Office and gave a speech to the workers, telling them not to retreat without results. Unexpectedly, Zhao left immediately after the speech and never reappeared. The workers then elected eleven representatives to enter and meet with Tao Shangming, presenting two demands: (A) For the officials, (1) Allow the establishment of a Joint Affairs Office of the War Zone Workers' Union as a labor-management agency to manage labor-management affairs in the Luan-Yu area; (2) Overthrow all old trade unions in the counties within the war zone; (3) Overthrow all party organizations in the war zone; (B) For the mine, a total of ten items were proposed, the most important being the second and eighth items. The second item concerned the labor-management contract of 1931, which must be implemented immediately, and the eighth item demanded that the mine must immediately pay the wages during the strike period. Negotiations lasted another three hours, but still no progress was made. The eleven representatives withdrew and re-elected two representatives to enter and talk again, but still no results were achieved. At 11:00 pm, the workers did not retreat, and they elected seven people to enter the office again to contact Tao Shangming. Tao told the workers that he could not immediately respond to the official demands, and that he had to ask the higher authorities for instructions, and that the second and third demands concerned the entire war zone, and that the Luan-Yu administrative region had limited authority and had no right to respond on behalf of others. The workers' representatives expressed understanding that the second and third demands could be put on hold first, but the first item must be handled immediately, and a notice must be issued that night, and the conditions proposed by the workers to the mine must also be negotiated on their behalf and recognized immediately, otherwise the workers would never retreat. Tao contacted Gu Zhenxiang, the assistant manager of the Kailuan Mining Bureau in Tianjin, by telephone, but Gu said that the mine would never reward the workers for resuming work under any conditions, and in the end there was no result. It is estimated that the workers started the siege from 5:00 pm on the 3rd and were unwilling to leave until 3:00 am on the 4th. Fearing that the workers would have a change of heart, Li Yinchun discussed the plan with Zhao Dazhong over the phone for a long time and decided on a solution: (1) Li Yinchun is responsible for contacting the conditions; (2) Zhao Dazhong led the workers back to the trade union to wait for news. If no one from the mining bureau comes at noon on the 5th, further action will be taken. After the plan was decided, Zhao Dazhong went to the front of the Commissioner's Office at about 4:00 am on the 4th and led the workers to retreat.</p>
<p>The old Guangdong Street trade union held a meeting and dismissed at about 6:00 am. On the 5th, Tangshan kept calling to urge the mining bureau to send personnel to Tang to talk with the workers, but the mining bureau was determined not to accept any conditions. By the evening, the workers saw that no one from the mining bureau had arrived, and they planned to surround the Commissioner's Office again. Upon hearing the news, Tao Shangming hurriedly sent someone to the trade union to dissuade them, promising to urge the mining bureau representatives to come to Tang again. On the same day, the workers learned that Yu Xuezhong had returned to Tianjin and would take strict measures against the mine strike. At the same time, after the Qixin resumed work, the workers did not participate in the strike movement, and the various mines were in financial difficulties due to the long strike, and Zhao Dazhong's tricks of deceiving the workers were gradually exposed, so they did not take active action. The Tangshan gentry took the opportunity to mediate between the officials, mines, and workers, and a peaceful solution was in progress. The order from the Hebei Provincial Government had also arrived in Tang, strictly prohibiting illegal activities by workers at the request of the mining bureau, and setting a three-day deadline for the Commissioner's Office to resolve the mine strike and arrest Zhao Dazhong and send him to Tianjin for trial. At this point, the workers' attitude turned softer, and as of tonight (the 7th), there is hope of pacification. (7th)</p>

<p>The market outside the South Gate of this city is desolate, even more so than the northeastern suburbs. Yesterday (the 8th) at around 12:00 am, three robbers suddenly came to the rice shop opened by Hou Boming near the suspension bridge. Holding knives, they warned against making noise and searched and robbed at will. Cash and clothing worth more than 300 yuan were all robbed and looted, and then they fled howling. After the robbers had gone far away, the owner recalled a quarrel he had with the old owner of the neighboring butcher shop three days ago. After being angry and frustrated, the old owner had expressed the meaning that "it's always in the hands." There were some clues and traces, and it was not without suspicion. Although there was no evidence, there was suspicion first, so he reported to the county public security bureau to take the butcher shop owner into custody for interrogation.</p>

<p>In order to implement the three-level and three-trial system, Luo Wengan, the Minister of Judicial Administration, specially reorganized the county courts in various counties into local branch courts and added higher branch courts in various provinces. Since the establishment of the county court in this county, there have been extremely numerous civil and criminal lawsuits. The original eight prosecuting and examining officers were not enough to handle them. Now the county court has been ordered to reorganize into a local branch court, named Wuxi Branch of the Wuxian District Court. President Xu and Chief Qian have prepared a budget and submitted it to the High Court for review and approval by the Ministry, and it is scheduled to be officially established on May 1st.</p>

<p>Hu Yulin, the driver of business car No. 684 of the Linji Business Car Company on Tonghui Road, drove passengers to Xiaoji Mountain for sightseeing at 11:00 am yesterday (the 8th). The car stopped after passing through Meiyuan. At that time, Kong Jigen (35 years old), a restaurant employee from Xiaoji Mountain, also intended to take the car to Xiaoji Mountain for business. The driver Hu Yulin agreed to let him get in the car. When the car reached the vicinity of the Second Peak of Wanyuan Hall, Kong Jigen's food plate suddenly fell to the ground. As the car was speeding, Kong Jigen immediately pushed open the car door, intending to pick it up. Unexpectedly, he accidentally fell out of the car and lost consciousness. Upon seeing this, the driver immediately stopped the car and sent the injured person to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of the fall, he was unable to breathe and died. The body was still transported to the Public Security Branch Office in charge, and the driver Hu Yulin was detained for custody. The County Court Procuratorate was also notified to request an autopsy for verification.</p>

<p>Tan Qixuan, the former Director of the Administrative Bureau in northern Wuxi County, was shot and killed by bandits in April 1929. After Tan Zhong, the father of the deceased, reported the case to the county government, he successively arrested the persons involved in the case, including Guo Asi, Zhu Ada, Zeng Axing, Lü Shiqiao, and Lü Genhu, and brought them to justice. Except for Zeng Axing, Guo Asi, and Zhu Ada, who had been sentenced to death and executed by shooting, Lü Shiqiao and Lü Genhu were sentenced to death by the former Wuxi County Government for the crime of premeditated murder. Later, Lü Shiqiao appealed to the High Court, which acquitted him. The prosecutor of the High Court then appealed to the Supreme Court, which sent the case back to the High Court for retrial. Hu Shan, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Suzhou High Court, has now concluded the trial and declared Lü Shiqiao and Lü Genhu not guilty.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that the commercial long-distance telephone business in Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong counties infringes on state-owned enterprises, and ordered the county magistrates and directors of the telegraph bureau of the three counties to ban it.

<p>Zhang Changgen, a 61-year-old man in Xidu, Benniu Town, Wuyi County, makes a small business to make a living. Because he is old and weak, he must rest for a while every afternoon before he can go out. Unexpectedly, his son Suobao did not allow his father to rest at noon on the 8th, and forced him to go out to do business immediately. Zhang Changgen did not answer, but Suobao took a knife and slashed at his head, causing serious injuries and bleeding profusely. He also threw the utensils, kerosene lamp, and rice bowl to the ground. Fortunately, he was stopped by bystanders, and Zhang Changgen was able to escape to the Public Security Second Branch in the town to report. Zhou Daonan, the director of the bureau, believed that the case was a parricide and injury to a parent, so he sent police to arrest the rebellious son Zhang Suobao, held a preliminary trial, and Zhang Suobao confessed to slashing his old father and requested leniency. Director Zhou of the Branch Bureau immediately sent the rebellious son and his father to the General Bureau in the city for review. The General Bureau ordered Zhang Changgen to be treated quickly because his injuries were quite serious, and transferred the rebellious son to the County Court Procuratorate for interrogation on the 9th.</p>

<p>Gan Zhuo, the newly appointed Director of the County Public Security Bureau, has only been in office for more than 20 days. Because he did not follow the provincial organization, he arbitrarily appointed Chen Chou as the Inspector General, and did not report it afterwards. It is heard that Chen has a smoking addiction, abuses his power, and dismisses long-term police officers for no reason, which has provoked the resignation of the entire body. At about 8:00 pm on the 6th, the order was chaotic and there were shouts of "Down with him!" Zhang Fengqi, the captain of the detective team, and others tried their best to mediate and allowed the dismissed police to withdraw their resignations before they were reinstated. At about 9:00 pm, Director Gan gathered all the long-term police officers for a speech, which caused misunderstandings with the people who were watching the excitement. The order was chaotic again in a moment, and the disturbance continued until about 10:00 am on the 7th. Director Gan sent bureaucrat Yang Daomu to apologize publicly before they dispersed. At the same time, a large number of slogans were found on the street, many of which were fierce and tense.</p>

<p>(II)</p>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>(Kobe Correspondence) On April 2nd at 5:00 pm, we bid farewell to Nagasaki. The voyage was smoother than before, so the passengers in the boat were bustling and talking intimately. Japanese also came to greet the residents. Many of them talked about the Far Eastern Games and knew our country's lineup very well. They think that we have hopefuls in athletics (1) Chen Baoqiu (Discus), (2) Situ Guang (Triple Jump), (3) Liu Changchun (Sprint), (4) Jin Zhongkang (Long Distance), (5) Fu Bao (Pole Vault). Each newspaper also competed to record and predict, and said that Mr. Fu is a staff member of the Diligent Bookstore, and Diligent is the only sports bookstore in China. Is their survey clear? I wonder if we can compete with them.</p>
<p>At 3:00 pm on the 3rd, the boat arrived in Kobe. First, there was an inquiry by the Water Police, and then an inquiry by the Customs. Fortunately, we are a visiting group. The Kobe City Government and our country's consulate sent people to greet us, and there was no kind of detour. After landing, we stayed at the late night hostel in Bu Street 1-chome. The hostel is completely Japanese style and exceptionally clean, but there is a kind of smell in the nest, which is the so-called "Japanese smell". At first, it makes people cover their noses for a short time, and then it becomes a habit. All the women in the hostel are serving. These women have received at least six years of elementary school education, which shows that their national education is very vigorous.</p>
<p>As soon as the hostel was settled, Consul General Lin Yanfang, Chairman of the Chinese Association Zhan Daying, Manager of Osaka China Bank Jie Kexie, and Director of Chinese Public School Dong Gong successively visited. During the banquet, the situation of overseas Chinese in Japan was mentioned, which is worthy of warning. It is said that there are three areas for overseas Chinese in Japan: Tokyo, where there are many students, Osaka, and Kobe, all of which are businessmen. The number of people in Osaka is less than one-third of Kobe, and they are all temporary in nature, mostly Shanghai branch stores. Kobe overseas Chinese are like natives, some of whom have lived there for generations, and some of whom have been in Japan for fifty or sixty years. There are more than 5,000 people. Wu Jintang is the richest among the overseas Chinese, with assets of more than 10 million. Unfortunately, he has joined the Japanese nationality. After the "January 28th" Incident, the number of overseas Chinese has sharply decreased, now about 2,000, and all of them are about to go bankrupt and are in a precarious state. The reason is that domestic goods are resisted, and the overseas Chinese sell goods to the natives in Nanyang, so the market has stopped. In the meantime, this kind of benefit has been taken away by the Japanese. Ninety percent of Japanese goods (more than 200 million gold) are operated by overseas Chinese, and now only 10% are left. Major goods are sold directly by the Japanese. When we heard the news, we could only swallow our voices and hesitate and could not speak.</p>
<p>The Japanese have been strictly suppressing Chinese workers since the earthquake. Recently, under the pretext of not allowing them to land, those who were ordered to return to their country are everywhere. Therefore, poor Chinese who come here must prepare round-trip travel expenses and deposit half of them in the Japanese consulate in Shanghai as travel expenses for returning. However, they can still mix with cargo ships, waters, and cargo teams to land. By the time they enter the inland, the Japanese police can't detect it. There are currently more than 2,000 Chinese workers in Tokyo, mostly engaged in digging ditches and carrying goods. This work is not even willing to be done by Koreans and Taiwanese, but our Chinese workers are doing it well. Who said that Chinese people are not as hardworking as others? There are still many Chinese merchants selling cloth, noodles, hairdressing, and Western clothes in Hanshin, but recently because the Japanese like Chinese noodles, the Japanese are strongly repelling them, which has become a problem. There are now about hundreds of people, and I don't know how to solve it in the future. There are about 1,000 Chinese hairdressers. The Japanese examination for hairdressers is very strict. All aspects of technology, hygiene, and methods are subject to inspection one by one. After passing the exam, if other barber shops on the same street do not agree or the number of households in a street has not reached a certain limit, it is difficult to obtain the qualification to open a barber shop. There are currently hundreds of Western clothing merchants, which can be said to be free. Among the overseas Chinese, those residing in Kobe are mostly from Sanjiang (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi), while those in Osaka are mostly from Dalian, Yingkou, Tianjin, and northern compatriots. The Chinese Association in Shin-Osaka is the general organization of the overseas Chinese. It has self-built houses, which are magnificent and impressive. I hope to work hard to create more benefits for the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>▲ Kobe City Education Administration Organization</p>
<p>Kobe is a transit point for tourists, and not many people in our country have the opportunity to visit for a long time. This Jiangsu Education Inspection Team only stayed for three hours. We have a short stay of two days, and the observation points should be different. Now, please first describe the general situation of its education administration organization for your reference. The city has a population of 820,200 people, but no education bureau. All educational undertakings in the city are handled by the Education Section of the municipal government. There is one section chief, four principals, four inspectors, three school health doctors, twenty-two clerks, supplementary clerks, employees, and servants, and three youth training staff, totaling thirty-seven people. The division of their affairs is: one is the academic affairs department, which is the same as the academic affairs section of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau; the second is the manager department, which manages the school's economy; the third is the construction department, which is responsible for school construction; the fourth is the general affairs department, which handles external visits and other miscellaneous affairs; and the fifth is the social education department, which includes youth training centers, women's associations, libraries, and strong men's education surveys.</p>
<p>The improvement of education in the city is discussed and evaluated by the Academic Affairs Committee, and opinions are submitted to the government for approval. The city has ten members of the Academic Affairs Committee, four of whom are members of the city council, four of whom are elected by the citizens of the city, and two of whom are male teachers in municipal elementary schools. I don't know why female teachers do not have this qualification.</p>
<p>The city's annual education expenditure is 1,320,000 yuan, and the expenditure is 6,022,000 yuan. The numbers are not small, and should be subsidized by the city government. The distribution of funds for various schools is as follows: (1) Elementary schools 2,998,364 yuan, night schools 2,901 yuan, vocational schools 182,822 yuan, kindergartens 61,579 yuan, secondary schools 358,307 yuan, libraries 41,112 yuan, youth training centers 53,957 yuan, and sports field fees 16,625 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the comparison of class size, children's population, number of households, city income, and education expenditure, the main points are described as follows:</p>
<p>Category Budget Amount Education Operating Expenses Per Class Education Operating Expenses Per Child Education Operating Expenses Per Citizen Percentage of Education Expenses in Total City Revenue</p>
<p>Elementary School Regular 2,998,364 yuan</p>
<p>Temporary 1,951,991 yuan 1,518 yuan 28 yuan 36.55% 25.187 yuan</p>
<p>Kindergarten Regular 61,579 yuan</p>
<p>Temporary 15,302 yuan 1,620.500 yuan 57 yuan 75% 517</p>
<p>Middle School Regular 358,307 yuan</p>
<p>Temporary 17,844 yuan 3,140.04 yuan 65 yuan 43.7% 3.010</p>
<p>Sports Field Regular 16,625 yuan ::::: ::: 20% 240</p>
<p>School Health Regular 19,656 yuan ::::: ::: 25% 165</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the proportion of education funds is large, which is more than half of our country, no wonder education is booming. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e161">Wang Ruibing Invents Six-Color Automatic Scientific Writing Method; Currently Experimenting in Ningbo Primary Schools; Will Give Public Lectures in Shanghai Soon <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Ruibing of Ningbo recently invented a six-color automatic scientific writing method. Its function is to enable illiterate people to learn to write on their own by following the guidance of different colors, and to understand the preliminary meaning and structure of words through this method. It is truly a shortcut to assisting the future of popular education in our country. Mr. Wang is now carrying all the charts, etc., to conduct on-site experiments in the primary schools of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association. He will give public lectures soon. Yesterday, the Shanghai social reporter</p>
<p>contacted Mr. Wang to discuss the invention process and the content of the writing method as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e162">Invention Process <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang has been devoted to mass education in Zhejiang Province for many years. Recently, in view of the importance of popular education in our country, the Chinese people have been sparing no effort in promoting literacy campaigns in recent years. However, most civilians who aspire to literacy are often limited by economic, time, space, and other factors, and cannot achieve their aspirations. Therefore, adhering to the principle that "if one can write, one can recognize," after seven years of research and practical experimentation, he invented the six-color automatic scientific writing method. In about a week, it can enable illiterate people to write and copy Chinese characters without making mistakes in strokes, and the style can be correct, and they can understand the structure of the characters. It is said to be a shortcut to promoting literacy campaigns.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Content Description <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The six-color automatic scientific writing method uses six colors to distribute each character or each character in each square grid, and arranges these six characters in a certain order, namely, the first "red", the second "orange", the third "yellow", the fourth "green", the fifth "blue", and the sixth "purple". Using this writing method, there is no need for painstaking guidance from education. As long as the learner remembers the order of colors and the two sentences "from top to bottom" and "from left to right," according to the thickness, length, size, the learner moves by himself, there will be no errors. The book has not yet been published, but there are sample sheets and instructions available for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Field Testing <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wang, the original manuscript of this book has been reviewed by many educational experts such as Cai Yuanpei, Tao Zhixing, Chen Heqin, Hu Shuyi, Shen Baiying, and Lin Zhuoran. After coming to Shanghai, he has given lectures and speeches at the Youth Association, Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association, and other places, which have been very popular in society. In addition to conducting field experiments in the main schools of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, he is also drawing detailed diagrams and writing instructions, and plans to hold a grand public promotion on a scheduled date in the near future, and use the results of the experiment to carry out a national literacy campaign.</p>

<p>The gold market fell yesterday due to the rise of the US dollar and weakening sentiment. In the middle of the session, the exchange rate was loose and oversupplied, breaking below 50 yuan. In the early morning, the overseas silver market contracted in England and rose in the US. The forward silver price on the metal exchange rose by four haos to one li and three. The exchange rate also rose. London raw gold fell six pence, US wheat rose 1.25, and US cotton fell four pounds per sound. Reports indicated news about the future of the US white silver bill. The gross plate opened and retreated to 53 yuan. It then fell further due to colleagues selling off August US dollars at 35.5 yuan. After opening, the gold market was sluggish due to hardening domestic plates and colleagues selling off, breaking through the 50 yuan mark. Subsequently, it rebounded because the Central Bank opened up more than 300 current accounts, and the bank's appetite remained high. The final situation stabilized, hovering around 51 yuan. It remained stable at noon, and the later market was even more mediocre, with a trend of hovering, and the fluctuations were narrow. Although Chinese merchants sold off US dollars, the bank's appetite favored selling short and covering long. The Central Exchange Bureau favored June US dollars, so the gold and exchange rate markets were balanced, and hovered to the end. It was found that sentiment was more timid throughout the day. Although there was a lack of telegrams internationally, Westerners had some private telegrams at low prices in the morning, saying that the US silver faction was surrounding Congress to force the President to take action, but this was commonplace and would have no actual impact.

<p>The afternoon market opened at 950.8 yuan, and goods opened at the same price. Hengyu Shengda Ganchangxiang Hengxing all sold. Although the bank paid, it still retreated to 0.1 yuan. However, because Mitsui ate August US dollars at 5625 and July US dollars at 4375, Hengxing Yong Ganchangxiang Zhifeng Yong and others entered to 1.1 yuan. McGary beat Bise May US dollars at 125, Daxing Yong supplied strips, and retreated to 0.4 yuan. Hengxing Yuanyi entered Yu, and soon it was still one yuan. Fuxing Yong sold off at high prices.

It was found that the highest price of the day was 952 yuan, and the lowest price was 948.6 yuan, with a difference of 3.4 yuan. As a result, it fell 4.5 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 1.25 higher due to HSBC Bank's US dollar listing, at 34.5 yuan, and the combined standard gold price was slightly weaker at 1,003 yuan. According to the closing price, about 52 yuan was pressed, one yuan less than last Saturday. The registration price for this month was 952 yuan, and the registration price for May was 951 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 952 yuan, and the afternoon water replenishment was at the same price. The pure gold price was 964 yuan. The market conditions for pure gold were calm. The Tianjin gang did not have much activity and lacked transactions. There was some trading in East goods, and the price was calculated at an increase of 12.5 yuan. Qianzhuang such as Dachang Detai sold a total of 2,000 taels of strips to Yingfeng Hengda Decheng, etc. There were still 203 term strips remaining for this month, with a total of three bulls and three bears.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Monday Bank Collection and Settlement Slightly Cumbersome <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>This year's situation is unclear, and there is no possibility of a turnaround in the future of commerce. Therefore, although it is the time for the development of various industries in the spring season, there is no major news to record. In addition, this year's cocoon and tea season is extremely bleak, and the use of foreign funds is rarely heard. According to industry insiders, no one cares about cocoon foreign exchange, and tea consumption is also very rare. The foreign firms do not move, and the industry is reluctant to move forward. The financial sector has been affected by each other. Yesterday's interbank lending rate was 5% in the morning and afternoon, and the drawing head added water 2-3%. There was no new and vibrant atmosphere in the transaction of bills. The morning transfer was more than 4.2 million, and new transactions were more than 200,000. The afternoon transaction was more than 300,000. The transaction in the Small General Assembly was more than 500,000. The foreign mortgage transaction was newly made out for 4-500,000, and the redemption was more than 1 million. The inflow and outflow of banknotes was 1.7-1.8 million, the source of passenger traffic was 300,000, and the destination was 200,000. As it was Monday, the bank's collection and settlement was slightly cumbersome. It is estimated that foreign banks collected and settled more than 2.8 million in bills, 5.2-30,000 in various goods and foreign exchange mortgages, and miscellaneous collection and settlement, and more than 1.5 million in foreign exchange settlement. Warehousing, Chinese banks collected and settled more than 3.2 million in bills, 4.5-60,000 in various goods and foreign exchange tax miscellaneous collection and settlement, and 400,000 in warehousing. Japanese banks collected and settled more than 1 million, various goods and foreign exchange miscellaneous collection and settlement of more than 3.7 million, and 300,000 in warehousing. Qianzhuang foreign public order collection and settlement of more than 39 million, foreign drawing head collection and settlement of 7.3 million, various road remittance of more than 500,000, and cash collection of 7-800,000. In addition, the total number of exchanges in the city's clearing house on the 9th was 10,147,401.29 yuan in silver dollars, including 6,303,168.73 yuan in silver dollars, and 3,844,232.56 yuan in exchange silver dollars.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the difference between the morning and afternoon markets of Jiangnan small dollars was only 0.3 yuan. The morning market was 835.2 yuan, and the afternoon market was 835.5 yuan. As a result, it improved 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day, but the situation was still not very vibrant, and it is feared that it will have to go downstream soon. It is estimated that the transaction volume was 6,500 jiao in the morning and 7,000 jiao in the afternoon. The Guangdong small dollars were 755.5 yuan in the morning and 755.5 yuan in the afternoon. Both markets were the same, and improved by 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 95,000 jiao in the morning and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper dollars did not rise or fall, remaining at 323,000 wen, with 32,946 strings traded, totaling 10,200 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e173">The Serious Situation in North China Causes a Sudden and Sharp Drop in Public Bonds; Only Three Trading Sessions Were Completed, Closing at 7 PM; Declines Ranging from Slightly Over One Yuan to More Than Three Yuan <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, April 9th, the public bond market experienced an extremely turbulent day. The gains accumulated over the past few days were almost entirely wiped out in a single day. This was a natural consequence of events, but the speed was unexpected. The main reasons for this are Huang Fu's southward journey, the deadlock in negotiations in North China, the rampant behavior of Japanese troops in North China, a decline in public confidence compared to before, the dispersal of bullish forces, small investors rushing to sell, northern speculators engaging in short selling, and many large investors seeing the unfavorable trend and also selling off. As a result, the first session in the morning saw a small decline of several jiao (tenths of a yuan) to 1.5 or 1.6 yuan. The rebound was indeed not significant. Although the second session saw very little fluctuation, investor sentiment was poor. Only the aggressive buying of No. 46 barely managed to stabilize the market. After the evening newspaper was published, news of impending negotiations between China and Japan and the secret transportation of Japanese troops to China further eroded confidence. Coupled with the frantic selling by Northern firms like No. 11, the market became increasingly weak, with each bond falling another 7 or 8 jiao to 1.5 or 1.6 yuan. The 96 bonds even approached the 10 yuan mark. In the end, only the 18 bonds and Jin Chang bonds experienced smaller declines, while the rest each fell by slightly more than one yuan to over three yuan. Only three trading sessions were completed throughout the day, and the closing was still very late. Trading was very active. The details of the price fluctuations of each bond are listed in the table below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending weak, and the decline is intensifying. Due to the unfavorable environment and numerous rumors about North China, as well as inconsistent opinions among factory owners, speculators are inclined to sell. Meanwhile, sales of current yarn are becoming increasingly sluggish. Procurement from the South is sluggish. However, factories are competing to sell at lower prices due to high inventory levels, resulting in a decline of 2.5 to 5 jiao (tenths of a yuan). This shows how difficult it is to reverse the accumulated problems in the market.</p>

<p>In the opening market for standard yarn, due to current affairs news, prices for all months fell by 1.1 to 1.4 yuan. In the afternoon, although business was reportedly good, sellers remained scarce, and prices for all months fell another 1 or 2 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 23,800 bales. Dafu sold 1,800 bales, Chuang Kee sold 2,150 bales, Geng Feng sold 900 bales, Ren Feng sold 750 bales, Da Chang Cheng sold 950 bales, and Chang Feng sold 1,000 bales.

<p>The downward trend in the cotton market is intensifying, due to the slump in the yarn market and unfavorable news about foreign cotton, which has weakened investor confidence. Selling is on the rise, and bullish positions are being liquidated. However, some believe that the Cotton Industry Weekly Survey shows an increase in both American and Indian cotton. New buyers are particularly scarce. Japanese factories are reportedly considering reducing work shifts from May 1st due to poor yarn sales. As a result, the market is becoming increasingly sluggish.</p>

<p>Sales of current cotton have come to a standstill. Factories have stopped purchasing due to poor yarn prices. The sources include 540 bales of Yao cotton and 450 bales of Tong cotton. The current cotton prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market was again sluggish and listless. After continuously taking delivery of goods in previous days, Northern firms reduced their appetite yesterday. In addition, the market was unsettled by rumors, and bullish traders, believing that Bao sales could not continue, immediately began to sell to lock in profits on a session-by-session basis. Although factory owners did not engage in panic selling, they could not offset the selling pressure. In this lackluster environment, the large-scale selling by bullish traders immediately created an oversupply situation, and prices for all months immediately declined. In the afternoon, the market weakened further. The closing price for the current month fell by as much as two fen (hundredths of a yuan), while prices for June to August each fell by 1.5 fen (hundredths of a yuan), and the price for September also fell by 1 fen (hundredths of a yuan).</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were no major fluctuations in the foreign wheat market. Interest from forward buyers was weak, and there was little selling to lock in profits. The market was therefore weak and lifeless. Furthermore, recent trading in nearby months has stopped due to the active spot market. As a result, there were no transactions for the current month or other nearby months. There was some selling of new standard wheat for distant months, and interest from buyers was also slightly higher, but trading was limited. It was only enough to liven up the market slightly. The closing prices were unchanged for June and down 1 fen (hundredths of a yuan) for July and August. Arrivals and inventories of spot goods were strong, and factories had a strong appetite. The market remained stable. Shandong wheat was quoted at 3.57 yuan, Xuzhou wheat at 3.55 yuan, Suzhou wheat at 3.51 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 3.46 yuan, and Hushu wheat at 3.33 yuan. Fuxin bought 10,000 bags, Shenda bought 1,500 bags, and Huafeng bought 500 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Influx of Late Rice Causes a Sharp Market Decline <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the supply from various firms surged, with over 60 firms (accounting for over 9,000 shi [a unit of volume]) arriving. Late rice accounted for a larger portion of the supply, while thick japonica rice and Du Yang sharp rice still accounted for about half. However, there was little demand for late rice, and retail demand was also sluggish, resulting in a bleak situation. Only at the closing, the Northern firms began to purchase 1 or 2 loads of Xitang Fengjing rice and 1 load of Jiaoli special rice, totaling about 400 or 500 bags. The remaining transactions were only slight movements within the local street, amounting to only about 100 shi. Most of the rice from Qingpu, Sijing, and Songjiang could not be sold, and prices had already fallen by about 1 jiao (tenth of a yuan). The sales of thick japonica rice were also slightly weaker, and the prices of Changbang, Su, Tong, and Nangang goods followed suit, falling by 5 fen (hundredths of a yuan). Du Yang sharp rice remained stable due to the limited supply. The off-season sales market was still broad, and there were no major gains or losses.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, over 10 boats of goods arrived from the river area. The issue of inspection fees has been resolved, so sales of various types of rice were very good. The market saw a slight decline of 3 or 4 fen (hundredths of a yuan) for white glutinous rice, while the prices of white Yuan and Yin Yuan rice remained firm. The prices of Yang Du and Bu Ke sharp rice were firm. There was little change in the price of early thin rice due to the scarce supply.</p>
<p>[P Central Customs Rice Softens Due to Increased Arrivals</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of Central Customs Rice weakened because of the strong arrivals. The rice owners needed the sales. Only high-quality Central Customs Rice was in low supply in the storage and market, so it could maintain the price. The Central and Second grade rices had been short of supply and price had been increasing, but the price dropped immediately after the arrivals from Northern Jiangsu, Nanjing, Wuhu and Hunan. The need from Quanzhou and Fuzhou in Fujian province was still active. The trading was active, but the rice from Central Customs was softened by two to three fen (hundredths of a yuan). Five hundred bags of Central Customs Rice was sold at 6.77 yuan which was two fen (hundredths of a yuan) lower than the previous market, because people are still optimistic about the market, so they do not want to sell easily. Fujian firms purchased 2,390 bags of the rice from Xiang, Gan, Northern Jiangsu, Nanjing, Wuhu. Quanzhou firms purchased 530 bags. The price was similar to the previous market, but the price from Central Customs was softening.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed a slight weakness as the customs gold rate fell slightly. The public association's buying appetite increased slightly, but sellers were unwilling to sell at the original prices, so the price recovered to 8.5 jiao (tenths of a yuan). The original price of the goods from the local godown was 19.95 yuan. There were no changes in the prices of Ba Jiu Hao Dutch red sugar and Taikoo B grade white sugar. Zhenji's Gold Heart No. 1 refined white sugar from the local factory was still quoted at 18.4 yuan. The prices for Nos. 2, 3, and 4 remained unchanged. Chaozhou firms offered over 100 bags of upper and middle grade Chaozhou green sugar, with prices ranging from 11.5 to 11.6 yuan. Gaozhiyang offered several dozen bags, with a price of 15.2 yuan. Jianyong offered a small amount, with prices ranging from 16 to 18.1 yuan.</p>

<p>▲ Market Momentum Continues</p>
<p>New Sichuan pickled mustard greens have now entered the market. Due to the large supply and soft quality, the opening price was very weak, opening at 26 yuan. There are signs of a further decline in the market. Sales have not been strong recently, and the trend seems difficult to reverse. Yesterday, high-quality goods were sold at 26 yuan, and ordinary goods were sold at 24 yuan. Due to the small trading volume, transactions were very sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Oil Market: The Price of Hankou White Tung Oil Accelerates Upwards <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The price of white tung oil in the Hankou market is gradually rising. Initially, the momentum was not too strong, but recently there has been a clear trend of soaring prices. At the beginning of this month, foreign firms were still selling at 25 yuan. In the following three or four days, the telegram price had already increased to 26 yuan, and on the seventh day, the telegram price was 27 yuan. Last night, the telegram price from Hankou increased again to 27.6 yuan, and further increases are expected. In just one week, the price has risen by about 3 yuan. The intensity of the price increase is unprecedented in recent years. The transaction volume is about 1,000 tons. When the price was at 24 or 25 yuan, foreign firms only handled a few dozen or a hundred tons at most, so it was difficult to say that the price increase was gradual, and the momentum was not too strong. When the price was between 26 and 27 yuan, there were a total of 500 or 600 tons of transactions, which created a market of rapid and aggressive price increases. However, the supply is still scarce, and there is a shortage of goods. Recently, Hankou purchased Xiang tung oil at prices ranging from 20.078 to 21.56 yuan, and supported tung oil was also increased from 21 to about 23 yuan. These are all customer prices. Foreign firms in this port also purchased several dozen tons in the previous week, but because they rely on Zhejiang tung oil, they could not sell in large quantities. Seeing the continuous price increases in the Hankou market, the Hangzhou market also followed suit and increased prices. Two or three days ago, the price was still only 21.46 yuan per dan (a unit of weight) delivered to Shanghai. According to yesterday's telegram, the price has been raised to 22 yuan. Local firms, recognizing that this price increase is entirely driven by foreign sales, while domestic sales remain the same, are not too enthusiastic about purchasing from Hangzhou and are only buying and selling as needed.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Metals: Eastern White Iron Prices Fluctuate <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The recent arrivals of Eastern white iron have been very strong. The Osaka, Mitsubishi, HSBC, and other godowns have been receiving shipments almost every day. The trend is almost enough to overthrow the British and American goods. As a result, both local and foreign merchants have been purchasing. The 7-foot sheets are in better demand. Osaka is not shipping much, and confidence is relatively strong. The estimated market price is 1.08 or 1.09 yuan per sheet, which is 3 or 4 fen (hundredths of a yuan) higher than before. Some people are even asking for 1.10 yuan. The transaction volume yesterday reached over 4,000 sheets. The 6-foot sheets are in greater supply, and the factories are also receiving frequent shipments. As a result, confidence is relatively weak, and customer sales are also limited. The market price is very weak, opening at 8.4 or 8.5 jiao (tenths of a yuan) per sheet. Large quantities can be discounted to as low as 8.35 jiao (tenths of a yuan). It is reported that the market opened for only over 1,000 sheets yesterday. In addition, although there were transactions for No. 28, No. 26, and other varieties, both purchases and sales were limited, and there were no changes in the market.</p>

<p>White Drill has not seen any transactions because it is still early in the season. However, merchants have already started offering it for sale.拆貨(Chai huo) stores in the Hongkou area are preparing samples to send to tailoring shops in various ports. Chongqing firms stationed in Shanghai were requesting samples. Customers from Huasheng, Xincheng, Yu Yu, Dahengfu, Desheng, Fu, and other firms were the first to negotiate purchases. About a dozen bolts of Yiji's Immortal Grass white drill were sold that day at a price of 5 yuan net. The goods were shipped via postal parcel.</p>

<p>(Sharp Decline in Chinese Silk Exports to the US) New York City in the United States has numerous silk weaving factories and is a major consumer of raw silk. Chinese silk exports to New York account for 40-50% of total exports. In recent years, Chinese silk exports to the US have plummeted due to competition from Japanese silk and rayon. The quantity of Chinese silk shipped to New York last month (i.e., March) saw a disastrous decline, with statistics showing only 490 bales, a sharp decrease of 430 bales compared to February. (Huzhou Silk Actively Shipped to Shanghai) Due to the persistent slump in silk sales in Europe and the US, there has been a long-term lack of large-scale silk shipments from Ji Li to Shanghai. Now that the spring silkworm season has begun in Hangzhou and Shaoxing, and new cocoons will soon be on the market, the silk stored in the production areas is being actively shipped to Shanghai. In recent days, a total of 134 bales of dried and white silk have arrived.</p>
<p>Being sold in the upper godowns.</p>
<p>(European and American Silk Telegrams Not Relayed) Overseas markets have sufficient silk inventories to meet demand. Japanese silk is being dumped relentlessly, and silk prices are fluctuating. Importers are actively seeking to sell the Chinese silk in their possession. Telegrams for spot silk from Shanghai to New York and Lyon were not relayed yesterday. Market sentiment was sluggish. Only Renji and other firms purchased 10 bales each of raw and grey silk yesterday. Prices remained sluggish.</p>

<p>Low-grade Show Mei green tea has seen a sudden increase in sales recently. Customers from Shandong and Tianjin stationed in Shanghai are actively searching for supplies due to demand from telegrams. Tea merchants and brokers are very active. In recent days, over 800 boxes have been sold and shipped for export by customers from various routes. Due to low inventories, prices have risen from 8 or 9 yuan to 11 or 12 yuan. In addition, sales of Gongxi tea to foreign firms have stalled due to mismatched demand. Customers from Tianjin and Yantai have made some scattered purchases.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Revenge <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Charles</p>
<p>Eastern culture has generally been influenced by the doctrine of benefitting the world, and everything is explained in ethical terms, adding a stinking odor of education, thus neglecting the true reality of life. In other words, life has been worn down and destroyed. Everyone has spent two thousand years in a low-level education system.</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone who breaks the rules or reforms the status quo has become a madman, a genius, or a hermit. Buddhism does not center on humanity but longs for another world, yet it has passed on the Avici hell to people in this world. Common people are the embodiment of great rebellious thought and revolutionary thought. Compassion is a powerful weapon, non-resistance is actually the greatest resistance, and benevolence is often the greatest revenge!</p>
<p>For example, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is the simplest thing. However, if one can forgive, tolerate, and influence even an enemy, then the enemy will suffer the greatest pain. Because as long as one is human, one must have human feelings and a sense of conscience and ability. The Greeks understood this best, so the torture in hell depicted in their mythology is not a mountain of knives or a forest of swords, but a simple scourging of "conscience"! The suffering in life surpasses all punishment!</p>
<p>The Buddha's saying that the Buddha's power subdues lions and elephants, and tames dragons and tigers, is actually the best allegory!</p>
<p>Cold-blooded people, with poisonous flames filling the sky, usurp benevolence and righteousness, becoming great traitors, almost making the land barren. There are so many such people in history, but they disappear like smoke when they encounter compassion, just as one can resist ten thousand men but cannot withstand the slight smile of a child. Human power is limited, but intention is boundless? The Story of the Investiture of the Gods tells how the magic treasures of many demons and monsters are shattered into dust when they encounter the brilliance of the Tathagata. Although this is a foolish tale, it does indeed look down upon the demons in the world, feeling that they are nothing, and so it is written.</p>
<p>Although this may seem like a form of empty spiritual victory, it is not. Only revenge with compassion is truly victorious and permanently overcomes. Without spiritual victory first, there will never be material victory. The true reality of life is pure and peaceful, like the radiance of the sky. It is full of compassion and joy, and any darkness or malice will disappear without a trace when they encounter it. Is this not the greatest revenge?</p>

<p>— Le Bao</p>
<p>"The six armies did not advance, what could be done? The beautiful face was turned away, and she died before the horses." Let me say a word to the emperor!</p>
<p>The woman widened her slender eyes, shooting terrifying beams to the left and right. The warriors pulling her involuntarily took a step back. She lifted the red silk skirt that was dragging on the ground, raised her proud face, and rushed straight to the chariot drawn by three fine horses. Just as she was about to say:</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, how can you let them act so violently?"</p>
<p>But when she saw the emperor sitting in the chariot, his face had already turned pale, and the gray-white beard hanging on the front of his yellow robe was trembling incessantly (this was something she had never seen or imagined), she stamped her foot angrily and said:</p>
<p>"Old man, you've simply forgotten that you're an emperor! Hurry up and show the majesty of an emperor!"</p>
<p>When the emperor saw that his concubine was still so valiant, and the shouts around had stopped, he suddenly shouted instinctively:</p>
<p>"Yes, I almost forgot! Executioners, seize those troublemakers for me! You may ride with me in the chariot!"</p>
<p>The woman was about to climb into the chariot, and the emperor reached out to help her, but the voices around immediately clamored up, more fierce and terrifying than before. At the same time, a fully armed general rushed to the front of the chariot and said urgently: "Absolutely: Your Majesty! The revolution has come before the horses! Quickly: Quickly: "</p>
<p>The emperor scolded the general:</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! See if they have the guts to kill an emperor!"</p>
<p>The general leaned down in the chariot and said in a panic:</p>
<p>"Your Majesty! This is not like being in the palace!"</p>
<p>"Does an emperor not worth half a cent in the wild?"</p>
<p>The emperor roared. The general was angry in his heart, but he just murmured:</p>
<p>"Listen, if we go on like this, we'll all be dead! What's the point of talking about being worth money or not!"</p>
<p>The woman leaned against the chariot, weeping as she stomped her feet, and complained loudly:</p>
<p>"Marrying an unfortunate peasant is more promising than you, better than you!"</p>
<p>The emperor was very annoyed by these stinging words, and hearing the increasingly fierce shouts, there were even one or two cries of "Kill the fatuous emperor", he suddenly shouted at the general:</p>
<p>"Then quickly announce my decree to them and have her executed on the spot without delay!"</p>
<p>The shouts immediately stopped after the decree was announced.</p>
<p>The woman struggled in the hands of the warriors, her beautiful face turned pale, bit her lip and cursed:</p>
<p>"The words spoken in the Hall of Eternal Life were all lies!"</p>
<p>The emperor closed his eyes tightly, and hot tears welled up from the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>— Jiaming</p>
<p>The steam filled the room, like a mist, like a light gauze.</p>
<p>Through this light gauze, I watched the newly arrived guest.</p>
<p>He had a mass of white flesh all over, a full chest, full thighs. A thick mop of black hair covered his round head. Thick black eyebrows, and thick black short hair. His face seemed kind and amiable.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, he was standing directly across from me in the bathing cubicle.</p>
<p>I had no intention of developing any relationship with him, but just as I was lathering my hair with soap and turned on the tap, I suddenly shivered and drew my head back. Because, for some reason, the hot water was gone, and only cold water was pouring down!</p>
<p>The guest standing across from me, like me, was doused with cold water. So, we both involuntarily complained about the bathhouse attendant, and we began to chat.</p>
<p>"The equipment in this bathhouse is really terrible, things like this happen all the time," my new acquaintance said with a slight sigh.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," I said, huddled to one side, rubbing my soap-covered hair, letting the cold water splash on the floor, "It's really infuriating when it's suddenly hot and cold like this!"</p>
<p>The water got hot again. I rinsed my hair, letting the water run over my body, and exchanged bits and pieces of conversation with him.</p>
<p>Just as the water's temperature gradually increased, we quickly became very friendly with each other. We stood facing each other naked, without any reservations, casually playing with whatever words we could think of, as if we were familiar friends.</p>
<p>He told me many things about bathhouses. He seemed to have been to every bathhouse in the city. His words sometimes contained amusing stories, but at other times they were a bit like an adventurous detective novel. After he recounted the story of how a teaboy in a bathhouse cleverly hid a guest's money bag, but was eventually discovered by the guest, he said in a very gentle, sighing tone,</p>
<p>"It's such a terrible thing, one even has to be careful to protect their money bag while bathing."</p>
<p>So, we both sighed in mutual sympathy about the treacherousness of people's hearts in society today, and talked about many other aspects of life in society.</p>
<p>We talked very enthusiastically. I learned that his surname was Yu and that he was a small businessman. I also let him know my name and profession.</p>
<p>The steam thickened again. Through this gauze, I saw my new acquaintance sticking his head out, holding a wet towel.</p>
<p>"Finished?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Finished, I'll go out first." He ran his hand through the water on his hair. "Are you going anywhere after you finish washing?" (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Yao Ke</p>
<p>The dust that scrapes the ground falls on the stalls, sticking to all kinds of food. When cars pass by, the soup pots seem to have been sprinkled with a layer of pepper. These are things that "wowo tou eaters" don't care about, or even if they do, they can't do anything about it. Some people say that they have strong resistance and won't get sick or die even if they eat some dirt: this is really insightful, really right!</p>
<p>Once, a friend and I, with the determination to eat wowo tou, mustered up all our courage and went to a small street stall. We had just wanted to sit down awkwardly when suddenly a gust of wind swept up, covering the entire stall with dust. We looked at each other, our courage halved; just as the dust settled, a car sped past and stirred up another gust. We didn't dare sit down anymore and had to go to a restaurant a bit more upscale than the stall to try the taste of wowo tou.</p>
<p>Inside the door was a U-shaped counter, very short but very wide. Outside the counter were long benches, densely packed with hungry wolves of diners. The counter was covered with bowls and dishes in a jumble, a row of dishes containing pickles and oil-vinegar, and a large chopstick holder next to a large flat basket of pancakes and wowo tou. In the center of the counter was a stove boiling a large copper pot of millet porridge, and three waiters were busy darting around.</p>
<p>We ordered a plate of wowo tou, half a catty of sesame pancakes, and a plate of mung bean sprouts, and squeezed into the crowd to sit down. Breaking open the wowo tou, there was a burst of corn fragrance, and it tasted a bit sweet, but it was dry and coarse and really hard to swallow. We managed to get a large bowl of noodle soup to help us eat the plate. We only ate two-thirds of the sesame pancake, and sipped a small bowl of millet porridge, our stomachs were so full we couldn't eat anymore. Stealing glances at the other diners, we saw that their eyes were fixed on the food in the bowls and plates in front of them, and the muscles on the sides of their jaws | the so-called "masseter muscles" | were moving like the axles on a train wheel. The entire wowo tou seemed to turn into soft candy as soon as it reached their mouths, disappearing without a trace in an instant.</p>
<p>This is the proper, typical way to eat wowo tou; this is what I never knew, never carefully observed! Their way of eating is definitely not our ordinary way. When we eat, we focus on chewing and tasting; they focus on swallowing and stuffing. So, what we seek is the exquisite of the dishes; what they seek is the coarseness and solidity of the food, making sure it's stuffed full, lasts long, and is not easily digested! In our view, the purpose of eating is "nourishment"; in their view, the purpose of eating is "fueling up"!</p>
<p>In Beihai Park, there is a "Fangshan Restaurant" opened by chefs from the former Qing imperial kitchen, who make a kind of "wowo tou" the size of chestnuts | said to be what the emperors used to eat | with an exquisite style and a refined taste, sweet and melt-in-your-mouth, without even needing to chew, just tasting. This is only for serving the emperor; the working class definitely won't eat this kind of wowo tou.</p>

<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>"The Governor has arrived."</p>
<p>"Governor."</p>
<p>Hearing others say it, I knew that the person who came was the great traitor Xi Qia. This hateful thing, he sold Jilin Province, sold all the fathers and elders of Jilin Province, no, he sold the entire Northeast to Japanese imperialism!</p>
<p>The military band played military music for him for a particularly long time, the military police paid him a grand salute, and Japanese elementary school students, led by their teachers, even shouted "Long live Governor Xi!" three times in a row!</p>
<p>There were more police, they originally said they were here to maintain order, but in fact, it was more like they were here to monitor the masses. They were a group of pitiful running dogs, and we were a group of pitiful slaves.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock, someone on the stage rang a bell, announcing the start of the meeting. Immediately afterward, three earth-shattering firecrackers were set off. Everyone naturally focused their attention on the stage.</p>
<p>"National flag raising ceremony."</p>
<p>This was the second item on the agenda, and after seeing it, I felt like my eyes were really blinded by sand: what's called a flag raising ceremony? I thought, this is probably a Japanese phrase, it should mean raising the national flag, right? Then, why mark it like this? Is it to assimilate people, or to deliberately please people in order to gain their favor?</p>
<p>Two national flags were raised at the same time. I don't understand why every time there is a meeting to raise the flag, there is always a Japanese flag. This situation was not present at the meeting two years ago. That sun flag, round and red, isn't it sucking blood from the people of the Northeast!</p>
<p>The master of ceremonies shouted the third item on the agenda:</p>
<p>"Bow three times to the national flag."</p>
<p>The more I thought about it, the angrier I got, and I didn't even bend my waist.</p>
<p>Then it was time to sing the national anthem. To tell the truth, after being a "Manchukuo" student for two years, I still can't sing the national anthem. The reason is because sadness and shame pressed down on my throat. I don't sing, I can't sing; but I can't stop others from singing, so I still have to listen to others humming the lyrics written by Old Man Zheng:</p>
<p>"Between heaven and earth, there is a new Manzhou;</p>
<p>New Manzhou, is the new world;</p>
<p>Standing tall, without sorrow or worry,</p>
<p>Creating our country,</p>
<p>Only love, no resentment!</p>
<p>The people are thirty million, the people are thirty million,</p>
<p>Even if it is multiplied tenfold, we will still be free!</p>
<p>Respecting benevolence and valuing etiquette, improving ourselves.</p>
<p>The family is in order, the country is governed, what else do we seek?</p>
<p>Close, we assimilate with the world,</p>
<p>Far, we flow with heaven and earth."</p>

<h3 id="e196">Eradicating Superstition or Promoting Superstition? <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Mengruo</p>
<p>The Chinese have always revered superstition, and have been poisoned by it for thousands of years. Since the import of new European and American ideas, the clamor to eradicate superstition stirred up a temporary storm. By the time the National Revolutionary Army had unified the north and south, all cultural relics and systems were tending towards innovation, and superstition was also on the list of things to be eliminated. At that time, a group of radical revolutionary youth went everywhere to destroy temples and smash idols, and the forces of superstition almost lost their footing. However, superstitious thoughts had already taken deep root in the minds of the general populace; therefore, despite your shouting to overthrow superstition, it still exists to this day. In addition, the current China is gradually showing signs of returning to the past; the embers of superstition will naturally reignite. For example, according to recent newspaper reports, Shanghai residents held a grand City God Festival during Qingming Festival. Upon hearing this news, the Municipal Government, in order to uphold its long-standing advocacy of eradicating superstition (?), immediately issued a joint announcement by the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau, strongly prohibiting it; saying that "welcoming gods and holding temple fairs is a waste of public money and promotes superstition, and should be suppressed according to previous cases," calling on the people "not to violate it deliberately, lest it cause inconvenience." On the one hand, we can understand that the people's thoughts are still as stubborn as ever, and on the other hand, we can also see that the authorities' determination to overthrow superstition has not diminished.</p>
<p>However, things in the world are always so farcical and interesting. At present, the most eye-catching major events in our country's society, apart from the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, are the Kalachakra initiation presided over by the Panchen Lama. This event was previously held in Beiping; this time, taking advantage of the National Teacher's trip to the south, at the proposal of important officials of the National Government and with the support of socially minded people, it has been decided to set up an altar in Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou from April 28th to hold a grand event. It is said that the purpose of holding this Kalachakra initiation is to eliminate domestic disasters and pray for world peace. In addition, in order to seek the blessing of the Buddha and benefit the masses, the event also plans to set up memorial and longevity tablets attached to the altar, inviting the Panchen Lama to provide assistance to the voluntary donations of believers; either to relieve the suffering of deceased relatives, or to pray for the blessings of living parents. From this point of view, building this event can be considered a measureless merit. However, many people have already come out to oppose this move, arguing that building the event is promoting superstition.</p>
<p>That's right, holding the City God Festival is a kind of superstition and should be prohibited. But isn't building the event also a kind of superstition, and should it be suppressed as well? However, our people's thoughts are always muddled and confused; on the one hand, we want to eradicate superstition, and on the other hand, we want to promote superstition. It seems as if eradicating superstition and promoting superstition, two absolutely contradictory things, can be carried out in parallel without contradicting each other, which is really ridiculous!</p>
<p>Some people say that the Kalachakra initiation and the City God Festival, although both are events, there is a big difference between them; that is, the former can save the country and relieve the world, while the latter will only waste money and harm the people. I think if the Buddha Dharma is boundless and can make the country peaceful and the world peaceful: even though the City God's abilities are small, doesn't he have the power to bring good fortune to a few pious men and women? As the saying goes, "Only the magistrate is allowed to set fires, but the common people are not allowed to light lamps," is this what it means?</p>
<h3 id="e197">Decadence and Recognition | I wish to encourage my fellow youths | <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Laopai</p>
<p>Why does our spirit become decadent? Generally speaking, it is due to physical weakness and congenital heredity. By extension, it is said that the vigor or decadence of the spirit is due to the strength or weakness of the body. For example, the physical strength of a person's body: a strong body has great physical strength, and a weak body has little physical strength. The same is true of the spirit: a strong body has a vigorous spirit, and a weak spirit is decadent. Further explaining the reasons for physical weakness, the first is due to illness, and the second is congenital heredity. The conclusion is that if you want the spirit not to be decadent, you can only strengthen the body first. With a strong body, the spirit will not be decadent.</p>
<p>In my opinion, physical strength or weakness does have an impact on the decadence of the spirit, but if we carefully examine the root causes of the phenomenon of decadence among our youth, I feel that the principle of "recognition" is a very important one. Many things are blind, wrong, and many unfortunate things that result from blindness and mistakes are mostly due to the fact that recognition is not thorough. Primitive humans worship nature, and medieval humans worship religion,: : : all because they do not recognize the true nature of these things. We know that recognition is based on deep and broad knowledge, keen vision, and sharp thinking to analyze and observe a thing. The clearer the analysis and the deeper the observation, the more one has exhausted the ability of recognition. Using recognition as a tool, we can uncover the coverings of all things and all phenomena, and only then can we approach the truth of things and phenomena.</p>
<p>We analyze the phenomenon of youth decadence and know that their decadence is not due to physical weakness, nor is it congenital heredity. We know that the problems that generally plague the minds of young people can be broadly divided into three points: the first is the problem of love, the second is the problem of career, and the third is the problem of thought. Among these three, the problem of thought is the most important. Having one of these three can make a certain youth decadent, and can make a living man become such a desolate and depressed person out of nowhere. To avoid this decadent fate, we must find its fundamental driving force in this current society. Because when we know this fundamental driving force, we will know how society produces this kind of magic. We know that modern society is a society full of contradictions and darkness, so that even if our young men and women have passion, they cannot find a lover, and even if they have a lover, they cannot be together, so that we sell ourselves cheaply, but still often suffer the misfortune of unemployment. As a result, we feel that this world is full of darkness, and we seem to have lost our guide, and we are involuntarily confused and shaken. In such a world, if we do not have a profound vision and recognize that although the present is full of contradictions, darkness, and evil, it is only the highest degree of development of an old social system, a inevitable phenomenon of the collapse, then we will easily be intimidated and suppressed by this dark side, and as a result, we will be discouraged and decadent. So in between, it is only a question of whether or not one recognizes it, there is definitely nothing else.</p>
<p>If we can truly and clearly understand the current society, then we can know that the sniper attacks on love and the uncompensated exploitation of intelligence and physical strength are all due to this unreasonable current social system. If we further examine history and know that this society is not fixed but is evolving, and know that when a social system develops to a certain stage, it cannot but collapse, then we can not only know the reasons for our pain, disappointment, and defeat, but we can also determine our own thoughts. In the face of the current clash between these two major trends | capitalism and socialism | we know which side we should tend towards, so as not to become a backward person without a way out or a future.</p>
<p>How can we achieve these things? It's all because of our recognition of reality! So I feel that the strength or weakness of the body is not enough to determine whether or not we are decadent. Conversely, recognizing or not recognizing is the fundamental reason for determining it. So I feel that if we want to completely lift the veil of the problem of decadence among our youth, we can only put more effort into "recognition."</p>
<h3 id="e198">Dying for Face <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Jianxiong</p>
<p>People are, after all, animals who die for face. Anything can be glossed over, but once face is at stake, they will not hesitate to sacrifice everything to win the honor of a face. It can be seen that in the eyes of the general public, it is regarded as a second life.</p>
<p>Face, this empty thing, cannot be touched or eaten, but it is given to so many people to be infatuated with and to strive for, until they die without being able to wake up. There must be a mysterious effect that exists.</p>
<p>On a small scale, the big men and gentlemen who usually have status and reputation in society have actually declared bankruptcy once they are attacked by a certain force. But they cannot live without Western-style houses, cannot live without cars, and their methods are still just as extravagant. In this way, someone will naturally lend them money, and the status, reputation, and life of the big men and gentlemen will be maintained.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a generation of modern ladies and young mistresses strive for face even more than big men and gentlemen. They would rather pawn their head and starve their stomachs, but they cannot live without buying overcoats and cannot live without wearing high-heeled leather shoes. Therefore, modern guys see them and cannot help but pursue them. If they cannot pursue them, they stuff them with banknotes. Finally, all the problems are solved. Because face is important, the scene can only be supported, and a hundred-spirit-like effect can be harvested. So the problem is expanded here.</p>
<p>When disputes arise between people, because of face, they refuse to give way to each other. As long as someone with face comes out to mediate, a word can calm things down. At the same time, if party A has more face than party B, party B has to submit and let party A handle things. Therefore, the loss of the three northeastern provinces is also due to the fact that China has no face in the international arena. So this face was occupied by the Japanese. The Chinese desperately fight for face for themselves, but they can "endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens" and throw away face to the foreigners, doing a favor for the Japanese. Perhaps fighting for face internally but not externally is a characteristic of the Chinese, and the problem is of course an exception!</p>
<p>There is still one point, which is also a manifestation of the Chinese "dying for face." When they lie straight in the coffin with their feet facing the sky, it is strange, it seems that the descendants know that their parents have the beautiful virtue of not forgetting face even in death, so they issue a large obituary, print it with a portrait, and ask celebrities to write things like "The wise man has withered" and "The invisible is safely admired." Finally, in the mourning notice, they bring out all the ancestors of the deceased who have face, such as "The late great-grandfather Mr. ×× was from ××, serving as an official to ××: : :" Then comes "The late father Mr. ×× was intelligent by nature and studied in Europe and America when he was young: : : served as the director of the ×× department: : :" It is nothing more than saying how loyal and honest the deceased was, how filial he was to his parents, and how much he loved the country. He had never done anything bad, whether it was Ah Mao or Ah Gou, it was always a thousand-piece set of stereotypical articles. It seems that if you don't boast like this, it is not enough to win a face for the deceased and win him posthumous glory (?). This is also such a comical and humorous thing! (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e199">His Beautiful Image Always Revolved in My Mind <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Editor Sir,</p>
<p>I now have a perplexing problem that I have been unable to analyze for several years. I earnestly request that you, sir, would not hesitate to use your valuable space to provide me with a clear answer. Before I raise the issue, I must apologize to you, sir: I cannot reveal my name and address. I am well aware that this violates the rules of your column, but I have compelling reasons for doing so. Please forgive me and, as an exception, answer me this once!</p>
<p>I am a woman oppressed by a most stubborn family and am now twenty-four years old. When I was twenty, I worked for a certain company. At that time, a colleague introduced me to a boyfriend, who was three years older than me and very amiable. I was also very willing to be close to him. As time went on, we became even more intimate. Later, because I was extremely shy and could not bear the teasing of my colleagues, and because my stubborn parents monitored me with strict authority and regarded free love as shameful, I dared not reveal my love for him and could only swallow my voice and weep. After the Shanghai War broke out, I became unemployed and stayed at home, making it very difficult to be close to him. Although we sometimes met, we only exchanged a few words of casual conversation. Last spring, he became engaged to his female colleague. Of course, this matter seemed to have nothing to do with me, but in fact, the opposite was true. Whenever I sat quietly or rested, his beautiful image always revolved in my mind. Past events replayed themselves scene after scene without stopping. I repeatedly exhausted my spirit to try to eliminate these illusions and vexations, but I could never succeed. As a result, I was in great pain and felt like I was in a sick state all day long. I lost my parents' nurturing, and my only reliance is my brother. Although my situation is extremely difficult, no one cares about me. Recently, my mother has even said that I am old and eager to arrange a marriage for me. Such customs are inevitable. But unfortunately, I have been influenced by education and also because of him, which makes me feel very difficult. I think the reason why we need to get married is nothing more than to seek happiness and spiritual comfort. Now my mother believes in matchmakers and does not ask whether the other party is good or bad, only takes money as the goal. It can be asserted that my life's happiness and future are fraught with hidden crises. I have repeatedly advised her, but she is a stubborn person and will never listen. Furthermore, sometimes when I say something unpleasant to her, she faces me with tears in her eyes. I am most afraid of seeing others cry, let alone when I am in the position of a daughter. I cannot bear it, and after repeated consideration, the best solution is only to die. Moreover, living at home and relying on others for a living, I am often looked at with contempt. Relatives and friends often ridicule me. All kinds of difficulties are too numerous to mention. Being in this confused state makes my desire to die even stronger. Perhaps I am blinded by being in the situation, while outsiders can see clearly. Perhaps you, sir, can think of a way for me. Respectfully submitted by Anlan Fen.</p>
<p>Answer: This letter from Miss Lanfen reveals a gentle and docile personality in every line. However, precisely because she is too gentle, she cannot handle even simple problems. Therefore, what the editor wants to very solemnly tell Miss Lanfen is the eight words: "Be decisive in your actions and do not hesitate." As long as it is the right thing to do, go ahead and do it boldly. Otherwise, if you have too many concerns, you will achieve nothing. This is a very important point, and I hope you do not regard it as a cliché.</p>
<p>Your so-called "vexation" and so-called "various difficulties" can be summarized into two things: one is your lingering attachment to someone from the past, and the other is your unwillingness to let your mother arrange a marriage for you. Regarding the first point, the editor believes that it is entirely unnecessary. Humans are indeed emotional animals, and since you have very few social opportunities, it is natural to be reluctant to let go of a loved one, even though he may have forgotten you long ago. However, we must understand that life is not just about love, and our happiness is not solely encompassed by "love between men and women." If you fail in love, you can seek compensation in other areas. Conversely, even if you have a very happy love life, but there are many shortcomings in other aspects of life, it is not necessarily happiness. Therefore, the editor hopes that the first thing you do is to take love lightly. Furthermore, although you were very intimate, you did not dare to pursue him because you were shy, and he did not clearly express his love for you. In this situation, it is not really about love. Moreover, if he is still thinking about you now, it would be too foolish.</p>
<p>Men and women can create love by spending a long time together, but this does not mean that you can create love with just anyone you meet. This is like making friends. At first, you meet a stranger and feel a little unhappy with him, but later, after spending a long time together, you feel that he is not rigid, and you may even become friends. Therefore, the editor hopes that you will not have a very fearful attitude towards old-fashioned marriages. As long as you have a general understanding of the other person's character and appearance, and they are not very bad, then you can get married. It is not impossible to create love after marriage. In short, in our era, we should value the career we want to do more, and put love life in second place.</p>
<p>Coming back to the point, what the editor hopes for you and what I can offer you is only the word "decisiveness." Being afraid of embarrassment and worrying about everything is the worst thing. If you love someone, you can try your best to pursue them at the time and not be afraid of anything embarrassing. If it is not successful later, you should let it go quickly. Although you loved your former lover very much in your heart, the editor is afraid that he is still in the dark and does not know that you loved him so much! Perhaps if you had clearly expressed your love for him at the time, you and he might have already become a couple?</p>

<p>— Yimin</p>
<p>Last year can be said to have been a disastrous year for the overseas Chinese in Siam. Since the Kuomintang government came to power in that country, there have been various amendments to immigration regulations (those who are illiterate cannot enter, and those under twenty years old cannot leave), increases in entry taxes (previously, going to Siam only required an entry tax of 15 Siamese baht per person, but now it has been increased to 100 Siamese baht; the cost of a return Siamese passport has also increased from 5 yuan to 20 yuan); the adoption of Siamese bookkeeping (from banks to grocery stores, all must use Siamese books for the government to check at any time); the imposition of various harsh taxes (in addition to the original poll tax, there are also income taxes, remittance taxes, old goods taxes, and heavy taxes on daily necessities such as matches); and the implementation of so-called compulsory education (explained in the next section). Various harsh laws were implemented one after another last year. In addition, the world was in recession, and evil demons broke into Siam, causing several rice mills and sawmills to close down due to stagnant sales. Many shops, unable to repay their debts, recklessly set fires themselves in order to evade debt, and the number of matchmakers also increased day by day. These phenomena illustrate that the golden age of the overseas Chinese in Siam has become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese have been running schools in Siam for more than twenty years. There are more than one hundred primary schools in total (excluding private schools), with four or five thousand students. Middle schools have only been established in the last two or three years, including schools such as Overseas Chinese, China, Nanyang, Xinmin, and Chongbao, but they only offer junior high school, and the number of middle school students is also very small, probably less than 500. If we assume that school-age children account for 200,000 of the 3 million overseas Chinese, then less than one-fifth are educated, and the age of the students is mostly over the school age. A primary school graduate is usually 18 or 19 years old, so the underdevelopment of overseas Chinese education in Siam is evident here.</p>

<h3 id="e203">On "Evaluation of The Flame" and Others <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>When I happened to read Mr. Mu Tian's "Evaluation of The Flame," I couldn't help but feel a little perplexed. This is because he went to see it not only under the influence of a long period of advertising promotion but also because he "saw an overly high evaluation in the Film Special," resulting in him "going excitedly and returning disappointed." Therefore, I cannot help but ask myself, did I really deceive this "progressive poet"? Otherwise, the poet would only be able to write poetry and still "not understand the reason" for the movie.</p>
<p>The criticism of "The Flame" was written by me. Because I have to be responsible to the readers, I really wanted to write something to tell the readers and answer Mr. Mu Tian at that time. But later I believed that the article was not that wrong after all, and I did not require every audience of "The Flame" to have exactly the same opinion as mine (which of course is also impossible). So why waste time and ink?</p>
<p>But things are often not as simple as we imagine. After reading several large evening newspapers for several days in a row, it seemed like I had to say something. This is the motivation for me to write this article.</p>
<p>Regarding "The Flame," in fact, I definitely don't want to defend the playwright, but from the playwright's choice of subject matter to processing, he has to take into account the current bad environment and say what we want to say in a roundabout way. This point, apart from those who are deliberately spokespersons for the powerful or gentlemen who are helping to cruelly attack Chinese movies, should indeed sympathize with the playwright's hard work and give some forgiveness; even if he has small errors in technology. That's right, under the current environment, the director has to avoid the important and take the light, and make many unnecessary articles outside the theme (such as the depiction of Ah Zhen's vanity), and even change the flames of the landlord's dancing burning the thatched shed to Ah Zhen's carelessness. Is it worth the poet to scold so harshly for things like this? At the same time, it is also absolutely true that we have to emphasize the demand for reality, there is no problem with this. For example, we ask the author of "Wind" to pay attention to 100% reality in the future, but when we know that it has undergone some unreasonable cutting, we cannot help but sympathize with the author's hard work. However, Mr. Mu Tian said that "Fallen Flowers" and "Cage" are all undesirable "decadent images," which is inevitably an irrational request. As for saying that the "watery eyes," "small bridges and flowing water," and "dense green trees" all make the poet look down on them; even to explain that the fire brigade is at the corner of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road, and the villa is in Jiangwan, etc., it can only make people laugh. The former certainly should not exaggerate the natural scenery of the countryside too much and destroy the film's emotions, which can only be said to be the director's inability to understand further, but we definitely do not say that "small bridges" should not have "flowing water" and "green trees" should not have "dense shade," which is 100% reality. As for the latter, more people don't believe that explaining that the fire brigade is in front of Mr. Mu Tian's house or the villa is behind his house is "conceptual" and "not fictional."</p>
<p>In Mr. Mu Tian's consecutive articles, he repeatedly mentioned the demand for reality in movies, as mentioned above, we can know how he explains reality. However, if we observe further, he is just using reality as an excuse, and is actually destroying more meaningful Chinese movies, and exhausting his responsibility to "help out," then we will not know how to appreciate the "artistic" intentions of this "progressive poet." As for saying that the insurance company in "The Flame" is intentionally "preaching for imperialism" and that the workers in "Fragrant Grass Beauty" should speak in a mess, making the entire surface incoherent and clueless, that is the unfathomable poet's opinion.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Film Review of "Evidence of Guilt" <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Sleepers East丨Great Shanghai丨</p>
<p>Detective films, like Gangster films, are outdated. Although detective films have attracted the psychology of many petty citizen audiences.</p>
<p>Petty citizens feel the daily life is annoying, dull, and ordinary, they need excitement, so detective films, like detective novels, are loved by petty citizens.</p>
<p>This "Evidence of Guilt" is moved from a novel to the screen.</p>
<p>Ordinary detective films always tell us how cruel, how vicious, and how unforgivable the criminals are, and on the other hand, they tell us how brave, how intelligent, and how wise the detectives are, making people admire them.</p>
<p>However, in "Evidence of Guilt," the insidiousness and treachery of the citizens are objectively exposed. This is the commendable part of "Evidence of Guilt," although this is not the theme, and the focus is still on "love."</p>
<p>Moreover, "Evidence of Guilt" is also different from other detective films. Ordinary detective films use a tortuous and bizarre structure, unexpected horror, and a tense atmosphere to grab the audience's emotions. But in this "Evidence of Guilt," the appearance of the murderer and how the tragedy occurred are clearly explained first. This is the difference between "Evidence of Guilt" and other detective films, and it is also the reason why "Evidence of Guilt" cannot grab the audience's emotions.</p>
<p>Therefore, "Evidence of Guilt" is a mediocre detective film. In terms of performance, it is a complete failure. Lengthy dialogues, tedious stories, and a dull atmosphere, all of this completely fails to grab and tense up the audience's emotions. And here, there are also inevitable coincidences and forced combinations like other detective films, such as Gai Ander killing Lai Chi, and coincidentally seeing Wen Hua killing Lai Chi, etc. are far-fetched places.</p>
<p>The director's handling is also not good, but that Wen Qi Poxun performed satisfactorily.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Review of "The Magic of Women" <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Zhi</p>
<p>"The Women in His Life"</p>
<p>丨Cathay丨</p>
<p>The story goes like this. A lawyer accepts a defense case for a murder suspect. The murdered person is a middle-aged woman, and the suspect is the woman's husband. Coincidentally, the murdered woman happens to be the lawyer who is now defending the suspect's former lover. They had a love affair before, and later the woman disappeared, and the man, until the day of the crime, still regarded her as a lover he thought about day and night.</p>
<p>Such a subject matter, from the point of view of farce, is a good story. As long as the characters' personalities and environmental configurations are appropriate, perhaps a fairly powerful film can be produced.</p>
<p>However, what we see on the screen now is completely opposite to what we expected. The personality of the protagonist lawyer is described as very vague and contradictory. When he appears on stage, he is a playboy. His profession seems to be not handling cases but just socializing with women. Under such an atmosphere, once a former lover is killed, he will be shocked, grieved, and even driven to madness, which is no longer believable.</p>
<p>In addition, in this film, the audience's sympathy is mostly biased towards the suspect and his daughter, so the lawyer's "deep affection" and the conflict between his profession and emotions completely become an unnoticed existence. The psychological description from after his madness until he designs to solve the case cannot be understood and sympathized with by the audience. Therefore, the shortcoming of the play can be said to be the failure to grasp the center of the story and the inability to distinguish the levels of the theme and the sidelines, the inability to strengthen the theme, and the inability to control the audience's emotions, which is the weakness of the film's director.</p>
<p>In "The Fugitive," we learned that the so-called law is a tool that can be stretched and changed arbitrarily by a few people, and in this "Magic of Women," perhaps it is not the original intention of the producers, but it clearly tells us that the law is something close to a game. Regardless of the life and death of others, in addition to making money and gaining fame, there are probably quite a few who do not regard the case as their responsibility as "spokespersons for justice." If we say that the most worthwhile thing to watch in this film is that its authenticity lies in exposing the lives and social functions of this kind of people, of course, this is not the result expected by the producers.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this film already has major shortcomings in terms of playwriting, and the disorder of the techniques is secondary. In the second half, because the emphasis is on detective fun and the places that should be tense, it is even more fragmented and trivial. This is a work that lowers MGM's standard.</p>
<p>After entering, the usual Happy Ending can be spared criticism, but the wedding in the last group can really be said to be an example of the film's producers not having seriousness towards art.</p>

<p>The new film "X-Ray" has been extremely busy since it started filming. It is said that the interior and exterior scenes are being carried out together. Yesterday, the interior scenes of the Guanghua Silk Weaving Company were filmed. The scene was very complicated, and under the hard instructions of director Shen Tiansheng, the result was very satisfactory. The company is committed to creating new talents, so the personnel in "X-Ray" are all newcomers. The male leads of the drama are Xiao Gang and Lu Jianying, and the female lead is Ms. Chen Qiuyin, all of whom are new silver screen talents with excellent learning.</p>

<p>"Little Women" is an important masterpiece in literature. It inspires good impressions in many ways. Now the entire plot of this book has been filmed into a movie, which will premiere at the Great Shanghai Theater on Xizang Road and Nanjing Road tomorrow. The film was produced by RKO Pictures, and the editing techniques and compilation guidelines are top-notch, with many new contributions. The protagonist is Kathleen Hepburn, the second Garbo, who gave her full performance. Because of her hard work in this film, she won the Academy's Best Honor and leaped to become the champion of the top ten famous film elections last year. The director is George Cukor, the giant of "Gone with the Wind" and "Dinner at Eight". These two all-rounders together undoubtedly aroused the great attention of the general audience.</p>

<p>One day, as they were strolling in the garden, Nana suddenly stopped and pulled up something with many leaves. She exclaimed in surprise, "Oh! So this is a radish! I always thought it grew on carts!" This made George laugh heartily, and he embraced her. Nana, in his arms, sighed happily. She said, "I love this place. I hope you do too." George said, "Of course, I do. From here, I can see your window." He pointed to a window and asked, "Is that your room?" Nana said, "Yes. That room is beautiful, but it feels too big for a woman! It makes one feel strangely lonely." George said, "That window is only three feet from the ground. Aren't you afraid sleeping alone?" Nana widened her eyes and asked, "Afraid of what?" "Well... aren't you afraid of someone who fears nothing?" Nana said, "There are no such reckless people nearby." George said, "But there is indeed a madman..." As he said this, he embraced her and kissed her passionately. Nana said coyly, "Darling, be careful someone sees us." George said, "Besides Soi, Mimi, and Keding, there's no one else around. Don't they already understand our situation?" At that moment, Soi, Mimi, Keding, and the others were also discussing the two of them. Soi, in her worldly-wise and prescient tone, said to Keding, "Let them be. If a man and a woman will make love even in a vegetable garden, then it's definitely incurable!"</p>
<p>After four weeks like this, his older brother, Antley, had already heard rumors about his brother and Nana. One morning, his older brother was in the house using a telescope to look at the house next door. The place he was looking at was that window, three feet from the ground. After looking for a while, he put down the telescope and waited for his brother to return. After a while, his brother indeed returned, but he didn't enter through the main door; instead, he jumped in through the window. He jumped in and was startled to see his brother with a stern face. Antley coldly said to his brother, "You're really early. I'm afraid you've used this window more than once, haven't you?" George quickly tried to cover up, "I went out for a walk this morning, and because I didn't want to disturb the family, I didn't go through the main door."

George interrupted, "Slow down, Antley. I love that woman. That's all there is to it. I love her, and I'm going to marry her soon." "Marry? You and her?" George said, "That's right.
