<h3 id="c15">國際外交之新動向　貞 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>國際間陰霾密布無論在西歐在太平洋皆顯示和平現狀之不易維持一方面就列强擴張軍備上觀察一方面再就國際外交現勢上觀察卽足以窺見其一斑例如國際聯盟自德國退盟而後形勢支離加以意大利倡爲改組之說遂使歐洲陷於不可解决之糾紛中其尤甚者意國復單獨發揮其辣腕使奥匈兩國皆入其掌中對德固表示其敵拒之意圖封法亦盡量顯現其爭霸之本旨從前德意志退出軍縮會議未嘗不思借意大利之手以削弱法蘭西在西歐之支配勢力以改訂其素所反對之凡爾賽和約結果在外交上雖獲得若干之聲援而實際則初無所謂利益其損害恐較其豫測爲更巨蓋德國未料意大利竟能確切援助奧大利以制限德國之行動也然德波之單獨諒解亦未始非德意志外交上之有利作用以此更形成法意德三國對立之局而歐局愈陷糾紛</p>
<p>其次則遠東問題突然轉變卽獨占與門戸開放之爭執已不似前此之惡劣至少形成鈍化之局京來英美日三國之互相衝突就一般情勢而論英日兩國政治諒解之可能多而經濟利益殊難調和市塲爭奪之激劇遠非日俄戰後一九一四年前所可比擬美日之間經濟上利害衝突似並不十分急劇而政治上之難妥恊太平洋上爭霸之烈則不能不使人懹懼當前形勢之嚴重也現在英日之間爲織維製品市塲紛爭未决因而英日外交關係亦受震撼美日反先得若干外交上之諒解美國務長官赫爾與日使齋藤博往還文書之外益以菲利濱獨立之確認似乎美日間之衝突可以暫時緩和太平洋之戰爭更將展緩若干時日矣</p>
<p>當美蘇復交之際一般觀測類皆以爲除尋常通商增進美國對外貿易以外必然含有若干政治意味果然蘇聯外交轉趨强硬自斯塔林莫洛托夫李維洛夫各政治負責人員以至伏洛希洛夫加倫等軍事領袖皆發對日警告之强硬議腕循是以往蘇日關係非特恐惡化而已戰爭眞有一觸卽發之勢但知美國突然修改其外交方針蘇美外交未見有進一步之親密遠東問題則仍如前日之殭持今美又承認菲利濱之獨立於是日本可轉其海上之競爭力說意以經營大陸上之武力比賽矣</p>
<p>據此種動向以推論國際外交可作以下之分析</p>
<p>第一歐戰以後之國際恊調外交今後將成爲歷史陳蹟洛加洛之保安公約華盛頓之九國公約巴黎之非戰公約等之國際合作形式均將次第歸於消解不再發生任何拘束力量卽消極之道德裁制亦必等於空談除有臨時特殊作用外恐不再被列國所重視同時過去十六年間國際間一切問題莫不傾向於會議解决之一途雖會議未必卽有成果决議示必卽能見諸實行而歐洲各國鐵道上類多外交界要人之行踪各國之意見多賴會議以從事於疏解不安之局尤恃會議之力暫圖穏定從前國際間會議形式漸成過去而外交之折衝與單獨之聯結今後將另轉一種趨向矣</p>
<p>第二凖意奧匈三國恊定之事例與美日外交好轉之傾向以考究列國之現勢大都趨於回復戰前故態國際合作固被抛棄合縱連橫亦另成一新形勢其聯結同盟削弱敵勢之本意雖無多大異同而手叚之急激用心之機巧較諸戰前尤爲週密敏速緣表面上仍不肯公言打破國際合作之局而實則合作之企圖和平之標的早已成歷史的化石今茲所用專在於如何利其一國之所利其所以不完全否定國際關係者殆以今日交通之便需給特多已使任何國家不克閉關爲自給自足之舉欲企圖單獨一國獨霸似少可能故政治上聯盟運動以外復益以經濟聯盟也惟此種傾向愈嚴重則國際外交之變幻愈奇詭而危險性遂亦愈不可掩飾矣</p>

<p>赫爾對日又一聲明</p>
<p>（南京）　陸軍當局以明年之華府會議有提出滿洲問題爲議題之可能性、故非常關心、卽（一）中國以其傳統政策、以該問題與九國公約國有關係爲理由、　可爲會議之議題、必用盡手段提出、至爲明顯、（二）參加該會之各國、從日本因滿洲問題退出國聯、及目下對日通商壓迫等狀况觀之、豫料比一九二一年之華府會議必對中國更表同情、（三）不僅國聯參加國、卽世界各國、認日本在滿事變之態度、違反第一次華府會議簽訂之九國公約、卽從理論觀之、不能拒絕中國之提訴、故陸軍當局豫想上述各節、爲明年華府會議提出滿洲問題可能性之重要根據、究竟如何應付、目下正銳意研究對策、日内將向近將設置之外務海軍陸軍其他各關係當局之第二次華府會議對策恊議會提議、並强硬主張之、至主務當局間之意見决定如下、無論以如何之甘言美語、慫恿滿洲問題爲會議之議題、若予承諾、直接沮家「滿洲國」之發逹、紊亂東洋之各平、須斷然拒絕、故可不應該會議之邀請、因此須於事前自主探詢邀請國、是否以該問題爲議題、若確言不以此爲議題、而於會議參加後突然提出、可卽時撤回日本代表云、（三十一日電通電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美國商商請求國務院、特定三月三十一日爲「潘麗提督」紀念日、以紀念一八五四年三月三十一日美國潘麗提督與日本政府初次締結日美友好條約（按卽神奈川條約）之事、頃國務總長赫爾已接受、赫爾今日對此問題發表聲明、謂「潘麗提督所締之條約、爲日美兩國訂交之基礎、此後兩國鞏固之友誼與交互之利益卽建樹其上、我美國與日本之關係、在今日與在八十年前相彷彿、乃以友好爲基礎、斯則不獨日本、卽與其他各國亦然也、」赫爾繼稱、「日美兩國在工商業方面亦循同軌而行、彼此互不爲害、以謀人類共同之福利」云云、按在一八五四年以前、日本向推閉關自守、歧視外人、直至是年、美國潘麗提督率艦來日、叩關而入、日本是時又無堅甲利兵、自知無力抵禦、乃始與美人訂神奈川條約、開通海禁、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>日本霸佔東亞局勢</p>
<p>英美或將合作應付</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯方面以爲如再不採取緊急步驟、以和緩遠東之緊張空氣、則二次世界大戰爲期或不遠矣、據國聯會方面稱、最初參戰之國爲日本蘇俄與中國、而英美兩國則遲早必有捲入漩渦之一日、國聯會方面之預測、係根據其研究戰禍之起因而得、日内瓦預測戰禍之主要理由有如下述、</p>
<p>（一）中美俄三國對於日本希圖在遠東造成政治的與商業的霸權、必加抗拒、</p>
<p>（二）日本在滿之行動、破壤一九二二年華盛頓海軍會議所規定之均勢、</p>
<p>（三）因在一九三五年舉行之未來海軍會議中、日本擬要求海軍均勢、故日美兩國之造艦競爭轉趨激烈、</p>
<p>（四）日俄兩國之國交漸入多事之秋、可與最近蘇俄表示强硬之態度見之、</p>
<p>（五）日本國外貿易之擴張及日本堅持亞細亞門羅主義、轉使英國深感不安、</p>
<p>（六）中國拒絕承認日本人包辦之「滿洲國」、滿洲原爲中國之東三省也、</p>
<p>（七）日本正式宣告在一九三五年脫離國聯、及日本聲明繼續代管多數之島嶼、</p>
<p>觀察者預測日俄邦交在本年春季必將發生意外、東京與英斯科亦各掣造戰爭之空氣、而二國國界之衝突實有引起意外之可能、據熟悉遠情勢之專家稱、日本必須放棄其在遠東所抱之門羅政策、但日本不願、故結果日俄兩國惟有以兵戎相見、戰爭之結果、當然與美國之關係甚深、如日本戰勝、則美國必須决定參戰或退避、而讓日本獨佔遠東及中國之利益、據國聯方面稱、美國關於此事尙未决定其步驟、但爲預防計、美國已决計增强美國之海軍、至條約所許之限度矣、多數熟悉内幕之視察者則信、美國計劃中之美軍永無用以戰日之機會、此因華盛頓政府終將熟籌戰爭之代價與所得孰輕孰重也、然此則無異美國承認日本爲遠東主人之地位、及從此放棄中國門戸開放之政策耳、多數外交家則信、美國最後必將忍氣吞聲、退出遠東、俾專力開發拉丁美洲之政治與商業、如本年度美國尙無緊急决定之必要、但至遲至一九三五年海軍會議時、美國終須决定其政策矣、據日内瓦外交家稱、美國遠東政策之基礎、因日本在滿之暴行、爲之摧毁無遺、換言之、卽所有與華盛頓海軍條約性質相似之太平洋條約、現被視爲廢紙、據稱、九國公約已被破壤、因簽約國對於日本侵犯中國主權與土地、並無辦法也、日本在滿之行動旣告勝利、於是日本一變而爲亞洲大陸之主人翁、而華盛頓條約主持之遠東均勢遂被毁滅、再者、日本爲維持太平洋新地位計、對於英美兩國現珔要求海軍均勢、國聯方面深懼如日本之要求不能滿意、則倫敦及華盛頓條約期滿後、决無再訂新約之望、而其必然之結果、則爲海軍之競爭、然費用則誠不可計矣、與遠東條約結搆同在不寗之域者、則爲遠東經濟競爭之尖銳化、日本因其自身競爭之努力、遂感受與他國邦交之緊張、其中以英國爲尤甚、日本刦奪國外市塲之勝利、及日本英國競爭海上之航線、愈使英國不能忘情遠東也、有數方面則信、英美或將合作以促日本之覺悟、藉以避免流血與戰禍也（三十日國民電）</p>

<p>孫初無攻寗夏决心</p>
<p>離軍時官兵皆痛哭</p>
<p>富此行亦備受困難</p>
<p>北平通信、於一月前銜命西去勸孫殿英下野之富占魁、不辭辛苦、跋涉於河套沙漠、曾過數日之缺食缺水生活、卒以毅力完成使命、於二十七日返抵北平、孫殿英本偕富同行、但二十七日晨一時許、行經大同、適閻錫山所派衛戍太原之三十四軍軍長楊愛源、代表閻氏、迎孫赴晋、孫遂在該地下車、俟到晋晤閻後、並略事安置在并家眷、再擇日來平、並派其秘書長劉曾若、携孫函與富同來、謁見何委員長及孫氏在平諸友、答謝此次維持該軍之厚意、富劉等於二十七日下午四時半、到逹北平、富氏友人及孫舊屬、到站歡迎者頗衆、據富氏談此行經過如下、</p>

<p>我國改用虛金本位制問題、全國經濟委員會現已議决、交由財部幣制整理委員會研究、惟據本人觀察、我國改用虛金本位、頗難實現、蓋因金本位制之是否適用、尙成問題、試觀世界各國、英美均已由金本位而改用虛金本位、日本目前亦用虛金本位、法國雖用金本位制、惟國内流通者、仍爲紙幣、而絕少現金、是故亦等諸虛金本位、由此可知世界大勢之所趨矣、我國如須改用虛金本位、首須有金的存儲與凖備、惟我國目前絕無金的存儲與凖備、而欲實行虛金本位制、豈可得乎、若欲由中央銀行發行本鈔、藉以吸收現金、亦頗多困難、故據本人觀察、我國對於採用虛金本位之問題、目前難以實現、但世界大勢之所趨、將來銀價之高漲、絕難倖免、我國目前急須籌謀應付之辦法、以免將來發生經濟之恐慌、</p>

<p>以下再談談我們的憲法的幾個主要問題</p>
<p>（一）土地問題｜就是一般士大夫階級學者也承認，地租是一種不勞而獲的收入，地價的上漲是社會發展之結果，土地收獲是佃農辛苦耕種後的産物；土地所有者的獲得土地之酬報，可說完全是由於社會制度之所賜、而非於其人個人對於土地之有供獻或犧牲。在産業發展的先進國家，因爲工業勢力居於支配地位，這問題似乎尙不嚴重，但也不能說是完全解决；而在落後的國家如我國，土地問題却是橫在我們眼前的一個迫切的問題，尤其因爲最近數年來的農村經濟破産，更顯露出一般佃農的痛苦，他們的土地收穫賣不出價錢，而他們却仍要繳付地租、因此雖有許多人在想着枝節的補救辦法，仍是一日日的在趨向殁落。一般人没有認識到，這個問題的核心是在生産，關係政治上，是廣大農民要求獲得土地，並改良生産方法，發展農業生産力。因此，如果爲全體社會的發展着想，這個問題之無庸忽視，自不待言。</p>
<p>照現在的解决方法，現是在原則上，土地是公同共有，但另一方面，却又規定依法取得所有權者仍有所有權。因此，這種「公同共有」的原則比「主權屬於國民全體」，還要空洞。土地旣然是私有，爲何又是共有？卽使說，土地之增值，可由國家徵高稅，其利益可不爲所有者所獨享，而歸全體人民所共有？但是國家的利益是不呵爲全體人民所人同享受，仍屬問題。而且，土地之增價倒是次要問題，問題之重心，是一般農民能否完全享受其使用土地勞力的收穫。因此，立法者應當對此種問題鄭重考慮，而在憲法上規定正當的原則。</p>
<p>（二）民族問題｜隨着産業在地域上之不平衡發展、遂有先進民族與落後民族之區别，由於大量生産之結果，發生了民族壓迫民族的事實。更因資本主義本身之危機，先進國家壓迫剥削其自國内之少數民族或落後民族之手段亦愈形兇狠。因此，少數民族問題在憲法上應有詳明的規定，以保障民族自决的精神而减少民族糾紛之産生。此種保障有二：（一）嚴格保障少數民族之平等參政權，國民大會代表額數各民族應一律平等，各民族有權自己處理政事；（二）單是上項民族平等原則，實際上還是不够，仍難免民族歧視的現象，所以更應規定各民族有獨立權·這是實行民族自决精神的先决問題，萬不可忽略的一點。論者或謂如果明定獨立權，則各少數民族受帝國主義之煽惑而致於分裂，而分裂後少數民族必將淪於帝國主義殖民地，其實這是杞人憂天，實際上决無此事。如果國内各民族能够眞正平等决不會有分裂的，帝國主義不但不能挑撥少數民族分離，反而更能加强少數民族團結的决心；共同締成堅固的反帝同盟反之，如果不能建立密切的聯繋，一味的利用幾個少數民族中的貴族，雖無此項規定，分裂仍在所難免，蘇聯在勞働者宣言中，明認各少數民族的獨立權時，各少數民族因感於過去沙皇政府之壓迫，紛紛獨立，但獨立後因帝國主義之威脅，依然團結成一大聯邦。我國不承認民族分裂的權利，但是却發生了新疆獨立，内蒙要求自治等等嚴重的民族糾紛。總之，各民族間之能互相信任，能够合作當以是否具有信任合作之客觀條件，而爲保證民族平等精神起見，却不能不有權利的規定。</p>
<p>（三）生計問題｜勞資糾紛，整千萬的失業羣衆，這是現社會中主要的病徵，面明癥結以在則中國國民經濟的改造與發展一點上。故欲求社會之正當發展必先奠下發展國民經濟之一切條件，同時不取資本主義的原則，以國家的經營爲經濟的中心，一面造成功經濟的要求，一面限制私人治本發展而逐漸走向共同生産社會爲主眼。這是今日中國經濟的動向。在此國民經濟的改造中，自然應使大衆參加生産管理的機會，以加速度的改善大衆的生活。保證一切生存權，使一船文化水凖的提高，這一偉大的意義是建造國民經濟的内容。要如此，纔可談到今日之民生，不然一切都是空話。</p>
<p>（四）敎育問題｜敎育是我們人人應當享受的權利，所以不祇單受過一般敎育和義務敎育就算平等，高等敎育也是人人所應當享受。然而在商品生産的社會，除掉少數人能受到高等敎育外，大多數人祇能望着最高學府嘆氣，就是義務敎育罷，恐也非一般平民所能享受，一般平民的孩子們，他們逹到受敎育年齡，但是他們不能入學，其原因是他們没有閒空去讀書，他們須購些錢貼補家庭的生活。因此敎育平等機會似乎也祇是一句公話。如欲敎育平等，必需先將敎育不能平等的障碍剷除。</p>
<p>（五）婦女問題｜婦女問題本不是一個特殊問題，中國婦女的解放與整個民族的解放，本來是不能分開的，但在中國却特别加添着一重傳統的封建的束縛：就一般言，婦女在社會上的地位，是與男子有差别的。所以在憲法上我們應當特别對於婦女的地位加以保障。</p>
<p>以上所舉出的不過是幾個主要問題，更因編者屬稿怱促，篇幅有限，掛一漏萬，在所不免；好在本文的意思祇是在貢獻讀者一點研究的門徑，眞正的研究仍須讀者自己去做，並不能以本文淺陋的叙述爲已足。</p>

<p>— 容齡郡主爲本刋作</p>
<p>序</p>
<p>德齡郡主當年曾撰清宫二年記一書，早已膾炙人口，後其在美時，聞有出版物流行，乃因遠隔重洋，多未曾寓目，亦最大之憾事。去歲復見其新著「御香」“JmperialIncense”捧讀一通，不啻慈禧后之野史，同胞姊妹，天各一方，得見此編，不勝動雁序分飛之感。觀其章法筆致，容齡固望塵莫及，有如游夏，不敢贊一詞也。惟篇中所列，有一二事蹟，說得天花亂墜，儼若蜃樓海市，令人不可捉摸，良心所在，姑爲證之：如謂慈禧后與榮錄一節，查慈禧后入宫，年始十六，彼時榮祿隨任在外，尙是髫齡，彼此未嘗覿面，戀愛從何說起？民十年法國霞飛將軍來華，容齡曾備招待之列，其赴津所乘花車，卽書中所指之物，實則該車自造成後，慈禧后並未得乘坐一次。至謂宫中鞋匠等事，尤屬子虛，查后用之履，向爲各王妃命婦所進，回憶遜清時代，愚姊妹出入宫闈，侍后最久，惟吾姊出宫，在后薨以前，容齡離宫，在后薨而後，其中相距又三四載，凡禁内細微瑣屑，似容齡知之較爲詳確，故不惜曉曉爲之證明，以作吾姊搜集前朝遺事之一助。若論是編新奇熱鬧，只作小說看爲消閒釋悶則可，若視爲紀事，則半屬鏡花水月，虛而不實，且未免有傷忠厚，因憶及蔡元培先生石頭記索隠，詳證董小宛事，道德文章，殊足使人欽偑。况容齡對於吾親愛之手足，自不能已於言，傾誠而出也，知我罪我，其惟德姊。</p>
<p>再容齡現因編述英文明末遺事一書，日無暇晷，擬俟拙作　　竣事，當以英文逐條細細證明，俾使歐美人士，讀此書者　　，亦明眞相，茲因秦君譯登之始，略舉數端，聊以塞責。</p>
<h3 id="c211">「清明」 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>梧桐樹著花的時節，桃花已開得很盛，菜花也黃得燦爛，燕子在楊柳的嫩風裏飛來飛去，這是「清明」的特徵。</p>
<p>我們鄕間，於這個時期，每家會約了親戚，在家裏大嚼一頓。卽使貧苦人家，也會舉債來舉行一下的。因爲農商百工，一年忙到底，平時難得互相碰面，借這機會才可以「楊叙幽情，」試想祖先傳襲下來的許多節日，在一定的那天，各家都依賴迷信的習慣做了糕糰果餅吃，像端陽的粽，重九的糕。其實，這是完全由於當時聰明人們感覺到農商百工的枯燥儉樸生活，意有不忍；便想出了這個調劑的方法；｜｜｜清明的意義，决不全在於迷信。其次，清明是一個游子懹鄕的令節，什麽人都思念着故鄕，回去展謁祖先的墳墓。同時在族廟裏歡叙一天，「少長咸集，」議論着同族人的一切事情。倘遇繁複事件，無錢請求法律救濟的；亦往往在族廟裏以共同的意見，斷明是非。而且雙方都不能反抗，也决不會反抗。</p>
<p>由此，我們得體騐到「清明」的内在作用有二，一則表現了人民自動把渙散的情感團結起來；二則表現了人民也能處理自己的糾紛事件。</p>
<p>如果有人能提倡這種令節集會，並加以鼓勵擴大，這組織的成效，我個人以爲比了狂呌貼標語更爲有力！</p>
<h3 id="c212">害神經病者是眞英雄 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>人種改良學會，題出滅絕癲癎與狂病的計畫與問題，經過專家的研究，覺得這種神經病於人類的進步上，實在有偉大的貢獻。考察世界作成大事業的人物，害神經病的人，實居多數。喬里愛司與穆罕默德，是害過神經病的；拿破侖第一，亞歷山大，聖保羅，所患神經病甚烈。要在古代已有了人種改良學會，實行其手續的治療，恐怕歷史上的偉大英雄，必喪失了大半，而社會的進步，必與現在大不相同。現在德國政府對於癲癎，瘋狂，傳染的人，不間男女施以閹割。在其用意，只爲了傳種改良。然如司馬遷的做史記，魏忠賢的比孔子，閹割亦不能抵制謬種的流傳。本來一種天才的學者，創作的名家，必然有他神經系的作用，纔能發表他偉大的幻想。法國盧騷，他要不是害了神經腐敗病，絕對做不出民約論。德國馬克斯，他要不是害了極度風狂病，絕對做不出貲本入門論。但凡是天才偉人，多與神經病締結不解緣。在科學改良方法說，是要認爲罪惡的産生，毒害的來源。但在遺傳病原理的解釋·確切不移，有一種很大的效果。這便是我所認定的害神經病的是眞英雄。特有的奇警的結論。</p>

<p>慷慨剖胸襟忘家報國</p>
<p>凄凉對玉鏡嗟我懹人</p>
<p>屋頭上的雨，一陣陣唏沙唏沙的響着，只覺屋子裏寒氣襲人，由兩條腿直冷到腰上來。慢說空氣裏怎樣的冷，便是桌上放的那盞罩子煤油燈，也發着青色，只管向下沉去。天空裏的風，帶着雨絲向窗戸欞上打來，尤其是那有紙窟窿的地方，晚風從那裏鑽進，襲到人身上，自有一番凄凉之意。過了一會子，雨點子大了，很零落的打在窗戸上卜卜作響，更令人聽着，生下無窮的感喟。於是用手撑了頭，斜靠住桌子坐着。這條長桌上，放着的東西，都是嫁來的時候，人家送的物品，乃是一對花瓶，一隻小座鐘，又一面配了雕花架子的圓鏡子。那雕花架子，都是鏤雲式的，正好像當中托上了一輪月亮。記得花燭之夜的時候，两枝通紅的花燭，點得明晃晃的，映着那鏡子裏紅光外射，更覺是屋子裏喜氣洋洋的。可是現在那洋洋的喜光没有了，只剩了那盞豆大光燄的煤油燈，照着屋子裏昏昏沉沉的。記得自强在家時，自己坐着照鏡子，臉上紅是紅，白是白，自强伏在自己肩後，向鏡子裏望着，對着自己只管發笑呢。到了現在，可是一個人守着這屋子，一個人對了這鏡子，而且鏡子昏暗無光，也看不到自己的影子了。若是平常的人家，這個時候，新婚夫婦，還正是甜蜜蜜的呢，然而自己呢，可守着空房子。因爲那天晚上嘆了一口長氣，被公公聽見了，發愁的了不得，就讓自己到北京城裏去，若要再嘆氣，添上了公公的愁悶，他又要替兒子來寛慰我了。（三五一）</p>

<p>當我每天早上起來的時候，臉不洗，口不漱，先機械似地向壁上的日曆一瞧，然後很敏捷地用兩指一拈，嘶的一聲，把昨天的一頁扯去。這也許我已成習慣了，每天起來，先要扯日曆。我一頁一頁的扯着，扯去了許多的光陰；扯去了若干的歲月；也扯去了孩童時的天眞；也扯去了活潑潑的青春；現在已扯到了額紋重重的中年了。再扯着，扯着，扯到了頭童齒豁；曲背傴腰；直扯到了「兩手一伸兩眼一閉」不能再扯時爲止。我在想扯那日曆雖是平常的事兒，其中也包含着「人生的過程」「人生的哲學。」</p>
<p>民國念三年的日曆。撕着，撕着，已撕去三個月，還有厚厚的九月，更不知撕出了若干花樣。當我才有知識撕日曆的時候，還是大清皇帝的順民，撕着，撕着，撕去我細細的辮兒；更撕去了宣的統運命。共和成立以後，我每天的在撕日曆，每天有新花樣見着，「南北戰爭」「洪憲稱帝」「張勳復辟，」以至於世界大戰，都隨着一頁頁的日曆而映現。革命成功了，日曆上又多了一個紀念。可是「九一八」「一二八」給予的打撃，也使我們的日曆上，刻下一至深至鉅的痛痕。撕着，撕着，將來的歲月，未來的時日，一頁頁的在背後，我只希望一頁頁的日曆撕去了我們的恥辱撕去了我們的創痛，更撕出一幅國泰民安的彩圖來</p>

<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>端硯槪况</p>
<p>（五）端硯的價值　以上說端硯槪况，極其簡略，不過將研究端硯者不可不知道的一點說說罷了。至於前人觀察硯的目光，品評硯的根據，不同處很多，因之議論紛紜，各執一見，成爲一種黨派，如新坑舊坑之爭，子石山石之爭；重古重今之爭；重文重實之爭；東洞西洞之爭；嫩潤與堅老；有聲與無聲；亦各成爲爭論之點。嘵嘵不休，這是多麽可笑！僕雖無聊，也不願多所嚕囌了。惟尙有硯的價值問題，其高下頗與購硯者有密切關係，故附帶略說一些。</p>
<p>古人描摹端硯動曰「價直連城，」萬金不易，」不過形容其可寳貴而已，非眞有這樣的價值。蘇易簡硯譜云：「端溪自然圓正青紫色之子石，琢而爲硯，可直千金，」似乎較爲肯定些。然此種子石，究屬難得，亦决無一定價值。又查陶舫硯史說：「端硯平生約見五七百枚，十千以上無估，」雲林石譜說：「端石純品亦不過十來千。」可見硯價在清代以前，並不甚大的，吳石華偶然說上句：「今老坑大西洞，十倍於小西洞正洞石，小西洞正洞十倍於東洞石，坑仔巖麻子坑朝天巖，以次遞减，然較雜坑猶高數倍，」（見吳蘭修端溪硯史）而日人卽據此認眞計算起來了，他說：</p>
<p>照吳氏的話，假使數倍二字，定作五倍推算，譬如雜坑所出的硯，一方值一元，朝天巖所出的爲五元麻子坑所出的爲六元，坑仔巖所出的爲七元，東洞約高坑仔巖的二倍，就值十四元了。小西洞正洞以十倍計算，那要百四十元了。若大西洞更以十倍計算，要千四百元了。眞正大西洞的名材，的確貴重的很，而宋代下巖愈加不必多說。（見古河雅櫻硯譚）</p>
<p>如此推算，可見日人心目中，認端硯的價值，是很高的，而日本的愛硯狂徒又多，據他自誇的口氣說，「現在中國有名的佳硯，爲日本愛硯家收藏的很多，東京的愛硯家，比西京大阪的愛硯家，列有見識，搜羅名硯尤富，至於書畫家，爲實際的使用，感覺端硯妙於日本所産的硯百倍，故亦不惜鉅資羅致。」中國的硯價，弄得這樣的高，不能不算日本人提倡的力罷。</p>

<p>西捕昨作西聯足球甲組賽於中華棒球塲、　　發生不幸事件、上半時相安過去、下半時賽至一刻鐘時、陸鍾恩持球行走四步、裁判員鳴笛罰球、東華陳洪光似有輕侮裁判員之態度、裁判員罰其出塲、（因陳先前巳受儆告）東華要求裁判員宣布理由、裁判員不言所以、毅然離塲、一塲無結果、續繼復發生退票風潮、</p>
<p>行動越軌</p>
<p>風潮之主要原因、由於雙方行動之過份越軌、裁判員辛克萊、爲西商隊之中鋒、亦新進之裁判員、上半時加處罰、尚稱得當、下半時起愈爲嚴緊、但判東華之兩次越位、未免失眠、致遭東華及觀衆之不滿、同時雙方行動、益形露骨、寃仇愈結愈深、西捕之法拉斯及東華之陳洪光、均受警告一次、而越軌踢法之程度、實無分彼此也、</p>
<h3 id="c223">各一和局 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>上半時中、起初相安無事、比賽甚覺精彩、入後漸生嫌隙、咸生中傷之心、幸得裁判員之嚴密判罰、尚能和平了事、西捕先勝一球、爲法拉斯在三十碼外打入、球着地急滾、陸鍾恩竟失手漏入、但中央開球後、東華直搗黄龍、賈幼良之一頂、法拉斯踢入自己門内、東華乃造成一比一之結果、</p>
<h3 id="c224">各受警告 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>下半時起、裁判員視察愈嚴、然雙方粗暴之行爲、反愈覺露骨、裁判員判萬象華之兩次越位、啓上半時李榮安及萬亦有一二次）似覺失眠、引起東華之不滿、及觀衆之滋擾、而法拉斯及陳洪光均以行動失檢而受警告、球塲空氣、益爲惡化、</p>
<h3 id="c225">不服裁判 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>不謂在一刻鐘時、陸鍾恩持球行走四步、裁判員照章判處罰球、地點在門之右角五六碼處、然陳洪光似有輕侮裁判員之表示、裁判員罰其出塲、陸鍾恩及東華巡邊員馮君質問緣故、裁判員竟不回答、遽爾離塲而去、球賽遂半途而散、此事如何結果、須待西聯會之解决、</p>
<h3 id="c226">退票風潮 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>時觀衆大曄、然均立住不走、蓋又不知原委、久等而球賽仍不繼續、遂紛紛要求退票、法巡捕原有派數十探目及巡警在塲、見勢又加派大批巡捕到塲維護、捕房西探長及總巡均親率到塲、體恊會急忙辦理退票手續、計一元座劵原僅售去二百餘張、竟退出六百餘張、四角座二千餘票、退出達三千餘票、誠可謂無妄之災、</p>
<h3 id="c227">優游勝臘克斯 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>四比三甲組賽</p>
<p>上半時二對二</p>
<p>優游昨勝臘克斯於逸園、此爲甲組賽、江善敬因事缺席、代以朱璆、王樹森舊調重彈、任左後衛之職、臘隊多數健將、均因事他去、出塲者太半係新進人材、但作戰力量、殊不遜於優游、結果優游以四對三獲勝、非易事也、</p>
<h3 id="c228">上半時雙方各二 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>開球啓戰、優游　　五前鋒、轉瞬混入臘克斯後防、孫鐵腿得沈世琦傳來之球、故意讓于家球、不料一射不力、致爲柯克倫輕輕接住、臘隊反攻、難生效果、黄瑞華中央阻人、被罰、萊列奥力射、爲楊銘金拍出、無何小鍾破圍直入、傳至門前、孫錦順縱身擁入、但裁判認爲越位、遂作罷論、朱璆阻不得法、在二十碼被罰、鮑塞利拚命一掃球、竟入網、二分鐘後、孫錦順卽還他顔色、造成各一局面、家球勇森二馬盤宫、更上一層、成二對一優越局面、鏖戰未已、勃洛特得球、傳入中路、民哥士一射、楊金銘拍出未遠、鮑塞利及時趕到、撥送入網、再成和局、上半時終了、</p>
<h3 id="c229">優游努力獲勝利 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>易换防地之後、雙方似見疲憊之象、戰局亦因之非常平淡、你來我往、十五分鐘在尋常無奇中過去、奚巧生曾有一度峻急之掃射、不幸爲柯克倫腿部彈出、致未成事實、至二十分鐘時、孫鐵腿奮發有爲、單槍匹馬、搗入一球、於是優游之聲勢、又見强盛、唯不久梁樹棠在罰球區域之内、左臂碰球、被罰十二碼、鮑塞利一掃成功、因此第三次和局、又告成功、此時優游前鋒頗見犀銳、於最後五分鐘内、再由孫錦順打入一球、始以四對三告終、優游乃獲得最後之勝利、</p>

<p>參加人員　計到李石曾·蔡元培·吳鐵城·劉湛恩·李書華·褚民誼·丁爕林·王曉籟·李登輝·史量才·章駿錡·華林·楊允中·林語堂·沈鵬飛·莊文亞·楊光泩·杜重達·陳和銑·胡天石·崔濂·兪鴻鈞·李大超·陳光甫·葉譽虎·翁之龍·王雲五·吳藴初·張竹平·汪伯奇·劉鴻生等、及法使荷蘭公使等外賓、共百餘人、</p>
<p>主席致詞　首由主席李石曾致介紹詞、略謂今天歡迎莫列德先生、同時卽歡送莫列德先生、因莫先生於最短期間卽將離華故也、莫先生爲著名敎育家、同時又是國際勞工局局長、今天特請莫先生蒞會演講、非常難得云云、</p>
<p>莫氏演說　次由莫列德演講、由章駿騎任翻譯、題爲「現代生活中智慧勞動者之任務、」略謂智慧勞動者之任務問題、甚爲嚴重、對於文明維持、生活維持、均有關係、惟一般人對此問題有二種態度、（一）卽輕視智慧勞動者、（一）卽重視智慧勞動者、後者且不說、前者之輕視智慧勞動、其理由爲現代人因物質文明關係、無多時間未作智慧生活、在現在環境之下、實不適宜智慧者之生活、實則此種見解、完全錯誤、蓋任何物質之發明、莫不充滿智慧、充滿腦力、譬如機器之發明、絕非平空設想、須從智慧得來、近代生活有兩基礎、（一）衛生、（二）敎育衛生·敎育·無非是智慧工作、法國對於人類分爲三等、（一）資本家、（二）勞動家（三）智識家、此種分類亦是不對、因勞動者中有極多智慧者、故勞動與智慧不能分開、至於智慧勞動者任務、除應用到實際問題之外、更須擴張到社會國家國際間去、近代國際糾紛甚多、其原因卽智慧各異、不能了解、今後惟有智識界聯合起來、互相交换意見、互相研究問題、使國際間一無隔膜、國際聯盟會巳創設一國際文化合作會來担任此種工作、中國方面亦巳成立中國恊會、其力量很大、同時對於智識份子的待遇地位應當提高、故國際勞工局曾組織一智慧者委員會、其工作在提高智慧者之生活與地位云</p>
<p>奏樂餘興　莫氏演講畢、由古樂專家鄭覲文領導之大同樂會奏演國樂、節目如下、（一）全體合奏東方大樂、（二）金祖禮之琵琶獨奏、曲名塞上曲、（三）衛仲樂之古琴獨奏、曲名醉漁晚唱、極盡抑揚頓挫之妙、直至九時許始散、</p>

<p>二義務敎育與成年補習敎育須規定一律免費、義務敎育各國均早視作國家敎育政策、自國家主義大盛以後、此種敎育卽歸入國家的職權、所以義務敎育的涵義雖多、而以「國家有供給資財設施最低限度國民敎育藉用法律力量强使全國學齡兒童齊受訓練的義務」一義爲最重要、國家旣負有供給此種敎育的責任與義務、則不當徵收任何費用、其理甚明、否則不僅國家敎育政策不能貫澈、有失義務敎育的本意、而且妨碍義務敎育之推行、難達普及的目的、蘇俄在改行新經濟政策後、曾一度徵收學費、但不久卽行廢除、其他世界各國除荷蘭、幾無不以無代價供給義務敎育爲通例、其載明憲法者、如西班牙規定初級敎育爲無償敎育、葡萄牙規定實施强迫初等敎育且不收學費、土耳其規定初等敎育之授與概不受酬、立陶宛規定初等敎育在國家或自治機關設立的學校内免費、希臘規定初等敎育是强迫的、應由國家出費、芬蘭規定對於初等學校的敎育無論何人一律免費、波蘭規定國立及地方公立的學校免收學費、愛司多尼亞規定初級學校免費等、皆班班可考、我國義務敎育與初級小學向屬一體、國民政府公布小學法第十六條雖明定「小學不收學費」、但接着有「但得視地方情形酌量徵收」一語、於是所樹立的原則、不啻根本推翻、以致目前一般小學仍舊任意徵收、反得有所依據、觀於南京上海兩市、一爲首都所在、一爲通商大邑、敎育經費比之内地自當容易籌劃、然小學學費不但未嘗蠲免、且徵收數目往往超過定額若干倍、無異對履行義務者復加課税、殊屬憾事、此次憲法敎育章第三十五條有「中華民國人民受敎育之機會一律平等」的條文規定、似乎對於當今敎育機會均等的潮流巳有所顧及、可是我國社會經濟衰落達於極度、大多數人民衣食均虞不給、强令負擔子女學費、事實上不易做到、假使仍任學校自由徵費、機會雖屬平等、而實際享受者恐將永無平等之望、就國家現狀觀察、如欲各級學校一律免費、未免近於高調、但義務敎育爲國家基礎敎育、爲求實現國家敎育政策與便利推行起見、須絕對規定免徵任何費用、以社今後各地再有以收費爲原則、免費爲例外的習慣發生、至成年補習敎育係對軍長失學者一種補救的設施、此種敎育的對象、都是出身貧窮而在幼年時代失却享受義務敎育機會的人們、國家更應規定以無代價供給之、俾早日掃除全國文盲、</p>

<p>據日商某洋行大連支店奥日氏談、東北棉紗界之動向、全視農産物銷路如何而定、本年農産物暴落、農民困弊已極、棉紗布之購買力、自然减退、照目前情形、殊難樂觀、一般消費者僅購入必要之物品耳、此不特棉布如此、印棉紗亦無甚買氣、原來市價跌落時、期貨交易全然絕跡、所謂不能引起假需要、只能供給少量實際之需要、今棉紗布之如此不振、實根本原因、固屬農村衰落、而受人造絲之蠶食、亦爲原因之一端、最近人造絲之需要、頗有漸次增加之勢、</p>

<p>育兒問題專號</p>
<h3 id="c287">育兒問題之合理的解决 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 宇園</p>
<p>因襲的傳統觀念緊繋着中國人的心，大部分事業的進展都祇表現在沿革過往抄襲舊有的狀態下。中國的農村依然用着幾千年來慣用的生産工具以謀生存，内地的手工業小商業……等等也仍祇停滯在固有的進程中。「育兒」，自然也逃不出因襲的圈，同樣陷入於抄襲舊法不謀革新的下面。</p>
<p>固然，由於外來文明的輸入而有了較爲科學的育兒方法，在事實也有了遲輯的育兒之實施，但這，也正和其他新進事業一樣，祇表現於幾個城市的上層生活的人以及部分知識份子的中間。至少，在廣大的農村和大部分没有科學智識的中層生活以一睥人們還是談不到的。如果照這樣來從事努力於育兒事業的發展，那末照樣無濟於民族無益於社會的。</p>
<p>嚴格的說，育兒問題已不是一個簡單的醫學和嬰兒敎育的問題，在現在，尤其在急切求民族解放的中國，育兒問題却已成爲一個具有相當嚴重性的社會問題；關係於中國民族的前途，關係於婦女生活之部分的拯救與改良的。因此育兒也不祇是一種個人家族的事務，而應當是一種事業的，以及一種運動的，求其更廣泛更普遍的發展。這，便是我們所以需要特别提出「育兒合作」來的理由。</p>
<p>在過去的幾年中，也有人提出過育兒合作的方案，然而那祇見諸理論，並且也還是鳳毛麟角。至於實際，在任何合作事業都尙在萌芽期的現在，育兒合作自然是絕無僅有。我們現在之需要推進育兒合作却决不是在講一點新理論趕時髦，我們的目的當然更不是爲幾個上層生活和部份智識份子的利便。我們必須以民族復興與婦女解放的雙重前提來推動育兒事業。因爲：其一，我們認定育兒不祇是個人的而且是社會的，因而祇有用育兒合作的方式（糾集經濟，雇聘有經騐學識的保姆，集團性地育兒。）才能獲得效果。同時也祇有用育兒合作的方式才能使之普遍。其二，育兒合作在費用上比較個人養育經濟得多。育兒合作的成功，能减少廣大的勞動婦女以及其他貧弱婦女的負擔與痛苦。其三，育兒合作社的實現，多少也是婦女解放之部份的成功。從事於社會事業的婦女也不致受到育兒的牽累而影響於事業。其四，我們要用科學的育兒方法替代過往的舊法，也唯有以育兒合作的方式才能奏效。因爲祇有育兒合作社才是一個合理的安全的託兒所。</p>
<p>照現在中國的育兒狀况來看，可以說反成了民族復興和婦女解放的阻碍。一方面，嬰兒的本身因受了非科學養育和溺愛或無力去愛的結果致大都呈現着病弱，愚劣，粗暴由於這樣的兒童怎能不影響於國家民族未來的不健全呢！另一方面，大部分的貧弱婦女感到育兒的牽累和痛苦是不必說，卽經濟能力較好智識程度較高的婦女，也往往由育兒　問題而影響到自身的不健全和事業的不能發展。這都是無可諱言的事。</p>
<p>因此，我們應努力地把育兒合作的智識深入於農村，工塲，小城市，小鄕鎭，把育兒合作的組織泛廣地普及於全國。從事於婦女解放運動的人是不能把這個問題來輕輕地丢開；在每一個民族的復興者也不能將這個問題加以忽視。我們務必盡心竭力地在育兒合作的實踐中求得育兒問題之美滿的解决與完成。</p>
<p>至於育兒合作的運動應由幾方面去進行，這里也不妨簡要的提出幾點：</p>
<p>一，育兒合作社最好是由各地的先知先覺者着手組織，拿事實做各該地育兒合作運動　的基礎。進而到各縣各鎭以至各鄕村。</p>
<p>二，各級黨部以及各地社會敎育機關，婦女恊會，在所在地當予民衆以育兒合作之有　力的宣傳與提倡。</p>
<p>三，女學校增設育兒合作的課程。</p>
<p>四，任何運動祇要埋頭去幹，不唱高調，也不畏縮，育兒合作的完成也是有賴於這樣　的人的。</p>
<p>我們更希望婦女界對於育兒合作引起更大的注意。進而收得更大的效果。否則，僅單　純地向婦女羣衆高喊育兒的改進是等於空論，僅求得極少數分子對於育兒革新的實現也還是不够的。</p>
<h3 id="c288">育兒問題與勞動婦女 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 彤華</p>
<p>育兒問題可分成二點，其一是産母的産前與産後之休養；其二是嬰兒出産後的敎養方式。這些問題，對於富裕之家，是不成問題的。感覺困難而痛苦的只有受生活所鞭笞的勞動婦女。</p>
<p>婦女平日的營養，與充分的睡眠，是健康的母性的要件，而姙娠期間，過度的勞動與不良的勞動條件，更是保護母親與胎兒所不許可的。據醫學界一般的意見，婦人産前當要四週，産後當要有六週的時間休息，因爲子宫在第二個月才能恢復其常態。勞動過早，常使子宫下墜，出血，或炎症，甚或引起不孕及精神病，然而在資本主義制度之下，婦女都成爲工錢奴隷，强烈的，過度的，不適於婦女的工作，使她們的身體蒙受很大的損失；營養之不够，睡眠之不足，更剥去她們的康健；一般只在産前五六日間休息，過此以往，非入廠作工，生活便成問題了，在這種種摧殘之下，産母與嬰兒便不能保持健康而陷於疾病了。據哈蒲爾金氏的調查，在歐資産階級的婦人患流産者百分之九·一七，患死産者爲百分之九·八五，勞動婦女患流産的占百分之十七·八九，患死産的占百分之三二·五七，後者比前者增加三倍，從這一個比較，我們亦就可以看出勞動婦女之痛苦了。</p>
<p>産育是勞苦婦女的一個難關，然而過了這個難關之後，嬰兒之養育，亦是成問題的，母親入工廠，嬰兒抛在家中挨飢挨寒，而住居之狹窄不潔，使嬰兒之成長，受了很大的影響；至於父母對於子女養育之無訓練，｜｜只有情感，缺乏理智｜｜又把兒女養成任性貪慾自私等壤習慣。在敎育方面，勞動父母之對於子女亦是談不到的。</p>

<p>在蘇聯懹孕和撫嬰的母親，禁止做工廠夜工。分娩前後，母親得休假四個月，工資照舊給，分娩後六個月間，工廠女工每日平均得二小時的例外休息。</p>
<p>三歲以内的孩子，都在早上七時半送到托兒所去，那兒有看護替她們管理嬰孩，用科學的方法佈置遊戲，分給食物，敎導衛生的智識與集體的意識。在一九二九年城市和工業中心入托兒所的兒童逹五萬五千六百名，至一九三二年增至三十八萬五千名，在主要的工業部門，面分之七十五以上的女工，享受托兒所的便利。其他幼稚院敎育，公共膳食設備，公共洗衣所，兒童公共遊戲塲，社會保險，亦一天天發展。</p>

<p>中國的勞動婦女，比資本主義國家的，是更來的痛苦！在帝國主義與封建勢力摧殘之下，城市的工廠，减工的减工，關門的關門，工資低到極點。營養不良，休息不够；産前後休息六個禮拜的工資照給的工廠法，保是具文而已，其在農村，天災人禍之頻仍，農民竟以樹皮泥土，麥苗爲食品，所謂營養，所謂休息更是談不到，産母嬰兒，便無從保持其健康了。據茲幻月刋第六期所載，中國産婦的死亡率是大得可怕，一千人中竟有一百七十六人，其（在資本主義的國家，皆不及此，計丹麥爲千分之二，日本爲千分之三三，意國爲千分之三七，英國威可斯爲千分之三八，德國千分之五十七，美國爲千分之七十一。）其在兒童方面，死亡率亦是很高的，據張振之君所言「各國每千嬰兒中，死六十九人，而中國則每百人中死五十人，河北方面更有死去百分之七十五人之多。」産婦與兒童死亡率之高，是表示中國育兒問題之嚴重，亦是表示中國民族前途之暗淡！在此高唱復興民族之日，對這個基本問題，不求解决。民族前途不會有望，願國人注意及之。</p>
<h3 id="c289">小兒寄生蟲病淺說 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 醫務顧問陳方之述</p>
<p>寄生蟲，是專指寄生於人體内的軟體動物而言。若瘧疾赤痢等的微小原蟲，庎癬秋蝨等的皮膚螫蟲，雖然也是寄生於人類，但通常不用這個名稱。所以寄生蟲病四個字，看看好像嚇人，其實範圍是很狹小的；尤其是住居在都市中的小兒。傳染的機會不多。寄生蟲之有地方局限性的部分。寄生率極小。所以範圍也因之狹小。現在我分作有都市鄕村普遍性的部分。與限局於鄕村内傳播的部分。來逐條疏說：大槪從口傳染的多普遍性。不從於口，而從其他途徑傳染的多局限性。</p>
<p>甲，都市鄕村普遍性的部分：</p>
<p>一，蛔虫　日常所見的小兒寄生虫病。以此爲最多，寄生率最高的地方，往往百人中發見過此病的，在九十人以上。像上海市内的兒童，據檢查人的報告，在百分之十五到三十之間，也不可謂不多了。其發病的徵象：有異嗜。有善飢。有惡心。有嘔吐。有下痢。或睡液過多。腹部疝痛。全身貧血。亦有起反射性神痙證。（發痙，失神，等。）突然而來，父母以爲重病，一家騷然，實則大事無妨，不久卽能恢復。蛔虫多寄生於小腸。大槪從不潔的水及蔬菜等，帶入其卵，在腸中孵化爲仔虫，三四十日後，長大爲成虫，又能排卵出外。以輾轉傳人。驅除之藥。以鮮拿花的有効成分「山桃寗」，効力較爲確實。疳積糖中。卽含有此藥。其他海人草，使君子等，亦常常見効，但山桃寗能中毒，不可不注意。</p>
<p>二，鞭虫　也分布極廣，常與蛔虫同時寄生，比蛔虫寄生率小，發病證候也較輕。大體與蛔虫病相類。以頑固下痢及貧血爲主證。但其寄生部位，在於大腸的盲腸部，虫體長三四公分，不過蛔虫的五六分之一，傳染途徑。大槪也與蛔虫同樣，從食物帶入其卵，在腸内孵化，驅除之藥，多用Ｔｈｙｍａｌ。但往往須與灌腸法並行。</p>
<p>三，蹺虫　比鞭虫更短而小，不過其十分之一。其在便中。非極端注意，不能發見之。卵亦不如蛔虫鞭虫。能用普通顯微鏡檢卵法發見。所以往往診斷爲難。寄生部位，在於直腸，離肛門不遠，所以病兒多肛門奇癢或灼熱，搔壤之後，則發生充血炎證，往往因此引起睡眠障礙。除此而外，别無如蛔虫鞭虫等劇烈證候。感染之路，初時亦從飲食物而入，其後因搔抓肛門。將卵再從手指帶入口中，循環不絕，呌作自家傳染。驅除之法。多用大蒜液，或醋液，或單寗酸液灌腸。</p>
<p>四，縧虫　是間宿主，爲牛或豕，若吃半生牛内豕肉，有時能傳染，但决不如上述三虫之普通所常見。其虫寄生於小腸内。病人多腹痛嘔吐。消化障礙。或消化異狀。高度貧血等。虫體有節，節與節聯續，有時長逹二三十公尺驅除之藥，用綿馬或石榴根皮，但均爲劇藥，不可隨便服用。</p>
<p>以上四種，除縧虫稍有危險性外，其餘三種，病人被寄生之後，不過屢有病苦，别無生命危害。</p>
<p>（乙）局限於地方性的部分。</p>
<p>一，鈎虫。（或十二指腸虫）　多從皮膚侵入於人身，鄕間牧童村兒。爲職業所迫。露其手足。以與糞土肥料相接觸，是以感染獨多。尤以蠶桑繁盛之區，濕潤浮土，適其孵化，感染其病尤多。感染以後。多陷於重證貧血，久至易於出血，食慾閉，心贜弱，往往至於死亡。其虫長不過三四分。寄生於十二指腸，驅除之藥，多用Thymol，或綿馬製劑。</p>
<p>二，血蛭　亦從皮膚侵处，寄生於肝門脈，能使肝硬變，危及生命，我國蔓延至十三省，血蛭産生多的地方，面黃腹大身材矮小之病兒。觸目皆是。但在大都會中。則無傳染機會。因缺少中間宿主的緣故。此虫無驅除之法。用針藥殺之。比較有効。</p>
<p>三，薑片虫　浙江省蕭山縣紹興縣，爲最有名的浸淫地。其卵化後孵，幼虫入中間宿主的平卷貝，經無性時代後，出水附着於菱或荸薺等水産食物上，小兒生食之，卽感染此病。病兒往往發育障礙。或腹瀉腹痛，貧血下痢，其虫如拇指大，形如生薑薄片，故名。驅除之藥。多用Thmol。</p>
<p>以上所述七種，爲普通寄生虫，其餘如肝蛭肺蛭，旋毛虫絲狀虫，其患病徵象，與通俗人所稱小兒寄生虫病大異；且其病也比較的少見。是以略去不述。</p>
<p>「附註」江都余君濟之函詢之病狀，决是蟯虫，母及祖患此，謂之家族傳染。寄蟲病中，只此蟯虫病有之。服殺虫藥過多。當然不宜。</p>
<h3 id="c290">職業與母性的衝突 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 碧養</p>
<p>在現代來談婦女職業問題，如果還是占在性别的立場上來說什麽女子應不應該有職業，或者適與不適，這已經是過時的廢話了。現在婦女之要求職業，而且逐漸獲得職業，是一種社會發展之客觀的自然趨勢。所謂「男子治外，女子治内」的古訓，早已被時代的車輪將牠輾得粉碎了。所以現在來談這個問題，應該占在客觀的事實上，從實際的職業生活中去體現牠的内容，探討牠的實質，然後才能指出牠應走的道路。</p>
<p>中等以下的婦女，因受整個社會不景氣的影響，生活日感困難，於是大批的投入銀行，公司，商店，以及社會各種職業機關去充當職員，或當小學敎師，那些下層社會的女子，爲了生活的壓迫，也不得不大批的投入工塲，出賣她們的勞働，甚至有的還要出賣自己的肉體。就是那些結過婚的婦女，雖然其中有許多將結婚當作「扶養院」，然而事實上，不但單靠男子的收入不够維持生活，而且在這失業者衆的現社會裏，不見得每個男子都有職業，就是已經有了的，也日處於有失業危險的恐怖之中，所以她們也不得不離開家庭，抛棄兒女，跑到社會上來尋找各種職業，女敎員，女工，女職員之日益增加，便是事實。</p>
<p>現代婦女職業，從其本身來說，雖然給了婦女們以經濟獨立，脫離寄生生活的機會：可是在另一方面，家庭瑣事與撫育子女的重担，仍舊絲毫没有减輕，尤其是那育兒的工作，使職業婦女更感受一種莫可名言的痛苦！上等一點的職業婦女，她們還可以僱用奶媽娘姨來撫育子女，可是中等以下的職業婦女就很少有這個可能。至於那些「做一天·吃一天」的勞働婦女，生活都成問題，更說不上僱用奶媽或娘姨來帶自己的孩子。所以無論那一個國家工人區域小孩的死亡率，總要超過其他地方兩倍以上。</p>
<p>職業婦女爲生活所迫，不能不先解决吃飯問題，而將家庭和育兒放到次要的地位，等到工作完了，力盡筋疲地跑回家來，還要哺乳育兒，處理家庭一切瑣事，於是職業與母性衝突起來了，職業婦女的生活更加上了一層重負，同時精神上也更因此而增加一層痛苦！</p>
<p>但是，要怎樣才能避免這種衝突，解除這種矛盾呢？我們當然不能像愛倫凱女士因見到職業對於母性的妨害，就根本主張女子復歸於家庭，以育兒爲天職，這不僅是一種「因噎癈良」的辦法，而且事實上也不可能。應該從職業的本身上來設法補救這種弊害，將家庭瑣事，變作社會的事業；將育兒的工作，從母親的手裏遞到專門家手裏，變成社會事業的一部分，這樣才能免除職業與母性的衝突，才能澈底消除職業婦女的累贅和痛苦！</p>

<h3 id="c291">託兒所的重要性 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 養</p>
<p>托兒所在蘇聯已經是風行一時，並且給與了大多數人們無限的便利和滿意。現在中國也有一部分人主張試辦托兒所。但是有許多人都表示反對。理由是：以爲將孩子們從慈愛的母親懹中拿去，交給不相干的人看管，猶如把孩子送入育嬰堂或什麽關善機關養育一般。原因是他們不明瞭托兒所的性質。現在將托兒所的性質以及牠的重要性略述於下：</p>
<p>（一）兒童得受科學方法的看護　托兒所的組織，不能和中國的育嬰堂，相提並論。托兒所的設立，最重要的是特别注重兒童的健康和敎育。所以托兒所的設施，必須非常完備。保姆必須受特别訓練。一切工作大綱應由兒童事美專家，醫生，護士，心理學家等去决定，决定之後，得在各報紙上發表，以便一般人民參加討論，然後再經過兒童事業專家的審查，貢獻他們自己的理論與實騐决定一種制度。托兒所的一切管理方針，都是根據於醫學家對於兒童之必要的身體功能所下的科學解釋。凡有疾病的兒童，看病的輕重和種類，分别送入兒童醫院或疹療所診治。在這些托兒所之外，還應有實騐托兒院，這是感覺着養護幼小兒童的知識和方法須有充分的研究與改良，所以特别設這實騐機關收容一般普通兒童，使最優良的兒童專家，研究新的方法來養育兒童。</p>
<p>（二）减少婦女經濟獨立的阻礙　婦女應當經濟獨立，已經爲一般頭腦清醒的人們所不能否認的了。但是幾千年來受着家庭束縛的婦女們，一旦要離開家庭，去參加社會事業，最難解决的問題，就是孩子無人看管，爲着這問題，有多數的婦女們把自己的職業抛棄，回到家庭養育孩子。所以反對女子職業的人們，常常拿這種事實，來抵抗，作爲口實。若是社會上有了組織很好的托兒所，那末職業婦女們，便可把孩子從早上七八點鐘送到找兒所看管，到晚上，又所孩子領回來。這樣母親們的工作不致受孩子的影響，謀經濟獨立的婦女們的最大困難問題，自然就解决了。</p>
<p>照上述托兒所中的設備和敎養的方法，比較一般家庭育兒來得完備而調和。看護兒童的人們，旣是專家，必有很好的訓練和知識。所以做父母的絕對可以放心，將兒童送入托兒所，可以受到現代科學的護養方法。而這種辦法又絕不是平常人們所傳說的兒童國有，使一般父母與兒童完全斷絕了關係。做父母的每日工作之餘，仍可把兒童帶回家來，共享天倫之樂。婦女們要求經濟獨立，男女平等，却常受着兒童牽制和家庭瑣碎的事情所累，這種制度若能採用，祇少可以說是實行了婦女解放的初步。</p>
<h3 id="c292">希望有托兒所 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 白莉</p>
<p>窮的人，越怕有孩子，但孩子越是更快的跑來。</p>
<p>已懹了孕將近六月的我，憂愁，類惱，一天天在心底滋長着。我覺得｜這是一件重大的問題。</p>
<p>生活的壓迫，我倆｜我和我丈夫，不能不分頭去工作，以謀糊口。在最近的將來，勢不得不請假以待待生産，經濟的來源，只得他獨自負擔。節省一點，在生産前當然可無問題。</p>
<p>最使我感到繁難的，是産後問題。僱奶媽吧，要給她房子住，吃飯，在這僅够維持生活的我倆，當然没有這層餘力。自己乳育吧，則前途將斷送，自己不能去工作，那時生活眞不堪設想。然而；也只有此一途。</p>
<p>「我們能不能有一托兒所呢？」我們一羣經濟能自立的婦女常時希望着。的確，有了托兒所，我可以把嬰兒送進去，每月付些相當的代價，這是給與我多大的帮助呵！我仍然可以工作，旣不必受生活的壓迫，且給與兒童訓練得良好的身體。</p>
<p>記得一位朋友曾告訴過我，上海有托兒所一處，聽說是申報館中的人創辦的，每月付足十二元，你的孩子便可以平安的住天裏面，他們僱有專門人才看護孩子，非常週到。｜但我另外打聽别人，全說不知道。不知是否眞有此托兒所的設立，爲我們職業婦女謀幸福？</p>
<p>我期待着。</p>
<p>我不能放棄職業，同時，我又不能抛棄這未來的小國民於不顧。</p>
<p>我深深期待着：在孩子未出世之前。</p>
<p>編者按：</p>
<p>申報館並没有托兒所之設立，不　　過上海兒童幸福會，確有組織一托　　兒所的計劃，現已在籌備中，不久　　或將正式成立。</p>

<p>答蚌埠黃瑞蘭君。</p>
<p>問胸口氣痛，照來函所述，大槪是胃病，受孕後一二月發，是與姙娠吐酸有關聯。服中藥而愈。是吐酸期已過了罷。其後疼痛日期漸近，或因此引起眞的胃病了，這是非函詢所能明。亞砒酸有時確能順皮膚之色。但係劇毒之品。非醫師指導。不可亂服。</p>

<p>惟民國二十三年四月一日中華醫學會開會於首都。當明媚之春日。集君彦於一堂。猗歟盛哉。誠堂皇之大觀也。夫醫之爲事。學術與職業並重。敝會之設。雖以保障職業爲宗旨。而貴會之集。尤以發揚學術爲依歸。離則事分而力散。合則事集而力專。此兩會團結之所以爲必要也。爰本斯義而爲辭曰。</p>

<p>東西各國，醫學大會，事極隆重·有政府之鼓勵，社會之歡迎，到會醫師，少則數千人，多則往往逾一二萬人，吾國新醫，人數尙少，每次大會，其規模固遠不如先進各國，但二十年來，實已有長足之進步，曾憶本會第一届大會，到會者僅數十人，上届大會，逹五百餘人，本届報到者，已超出上届之數，第一届大會，論文僅十餘篇，且多用電報催來，卽内容稍遜，亦編入日程，期充篇幅，無内外各科之分，今則送到各科之論文，日有多起，後至者只可割愛，屏而不用，且科目繁多，討論時之分組，已多至内科，外科，産婦科，公共衛生科，皮膚花柳科，放射學，病理學，及生理學八項，大會之時，集專家於一堂，質疑問難，計其益處，約有下列數端·</p>
<p>（一）閉門造車，不能出而合轍，凡事如此，科學亦然，以已之所得，供他人推敲，苟有劣點，不難發現，此大會之有益於個人學術者一·</p>
<p>（二）學術爲世界公器，凡有心得，公開發表，打破數千年來舊醫秘密之惡習，庶不至以學術爲私産，此大會之有益於人羣者二·</p>
<p>（三）據吾人所知，往往有研究專家，將平日所得之結果，集成卷帙，年深日久，不能得其頭緒者，今由大會督促，必忙於整理，於是向來之埋藏於研究室者，今亦可整理完備，公之於世，此大會之可以督促整頓研究材料者三·</p>
<p>（四）大會將開，莫不爭投論文，向之懶於研究者，至是必欲一顯身手，素喜研究者，亦必加倍猛晋，此大會之可以鼓勵研究者四·</p>
<p>（五）本會會員，逹數千人，天各一方，平日僅藉信札及雜誌互通音問，每難暢所欲言，今有大會，則會員無間東西南北，集於一處，共同討論醫界之改進，公共衛生之推行，此大會之能集思廣益者五·</p>
<p>（八）總會會務，如無大會，則報告不備，議案或未盡執行，以致廢弛，今遇此大會，職員不能不倍加努力，各求無忝厥職，而會務進行，猛進無已，此大會之有利會務者六·</p>
<p>綜上所述，可知大會節目，雖寥寥數章，而一字一句，實代表兩年來千數百會員心思腦力之結晶，非偶然也·閉會以後，本會會員，各回原處，挾其所得，再加研究，以期深造，閉會期間則工作，開會之時則將工作報告，公開討論，循環不已，日進無疆，非如普通大會，議而不决，决而不行，故本會會員，在二址年中，雖開大會十次，而研究精神，則一日未或稍衰，際此會員人數尙不甚多之時，二年一會，似覺已足，將來會務發逹，人數增加，勢必年一舉行，如研究資料太多，不能一一歸納於年會，勢必舉行小規模之地方會議，抑或專科人才增加，除大會之外，又必舉行專科會議，現在已有生理會議，病理會議等，分科實行，實爲嚆矢。</p>
<p>總之，科學會議愈多，對於學術之貢獻愈大，本會每次大會，所徵論文，皆在中華醫學雜志發表，雜志創設之初，中英合璧，每年四册·現在中英文劃分二部，每年各出十二册，内載原著，極博得國内外醫界之好評，本會會員千七百餘人，内中三分之一爲東西各國之醫師，此種混合的學術集團，爲其他各國所僅見，可謂能實踐學術無國際界限之義，此次大會，在首都舉行，蒙當局予以招待，學術團體予以提携，新聞界予以鼓勵，鐵道部並予以減價乘車之利益，可見吾國朝野各界，對於本會，期望甚殷，本會同人，惟有益加努力，以副邦人之望也·</p>

<p>（會員卽有重大責任）</p>
<p>中國的醫學會，在過增的歷史上和現在的事實上，除研究學術之外，確乎連帶研究業務，醫育，衛生行政，一切關於醫事範圍以内的問題。</p>
<p>學會本身是集合全國各地的醫界同志而成，所以比較任何機關含有統一性和全國性。</p>
<p>唯其集合全國各地同志而成的學會，應當具有看到全國各地的眼光和見解</p>
<p>因此在這過渡時代的新中國，我看醫事改進的重心，未免還在幾個學會之上，而每一個會員就同時擔負着一部份重大的責任，於是各會員的言行思想，就與中國醫事前途發生了重大影響。</p>
<p>在學會開全國大會的時候，尤其是各會員盡責的機會，所以要請各會員時時以改進中國醫事爲念，而尤其要注意一埠的同志與各地的同志交換意見，方能得到適應全國的一種方凖。</p>
<p>雖然，現在中國當不止一個醫學會，然而多數會員旣可在一個會塲中交換意見，而得到良好的方針，那魔兩個學會何嘗不可在一個國家裏交換意見而得到更妥善的辦法呢？</p>
<p>會員在會塲裏盡職，謀中國的醫事改進，必須要有萬衆一心的宗旨，要有面面顧到的眼光，兩個學會供謀中國醫事的改進，也只在各會員的言行思想眼光而已。</p>
<p>諸位會員，請時時留意自己的地位上，有影響全中國醫事的威權。</p>
<p>中華醫學在南京開大會，申報發行特刋，囑京周爲文，京周謹以此數語祝　　出席大會諸會員康勝努力。</p>

<p>中華醫學會此次開大會於首都，爲與博醫會合併後第二次之盛集，鄙人躬與其盛，何幸如之。本會年來工作。觀於朱恒璧先生「一年來之迥顧」一文，卽可想見辦事之緊張，成績之昭著。凡鄙人前所希望於全國醫師聯合會者，本會皆已實踐無餘，允矣其合於團體生存之條什也。謹就鄙人思慮所及，略陳數點，以爲本會今後工作之補充，儻亦會員諸公所樂許者歟？</p>
<p>（一）設立醫學研究院之建議　研究院爲國家最高之學府，無論何種科學，凡欲探討其高深之境地者，胥有賴乎研究院之設立。自政府定都金陵以後。注意於國内之敎育專業，於是有中央研究院之創設。舉凡文理各科，莫不應有儘有，獨對於科學結晶之醫學，則至今尙付闕如，聯是之故，國内之醫校學業者，國外之留學歸來者，欲求斷續之研究，而苦無適當之機關，夫學術無止境，要在於下斷之研求，今旣乏此種研究機關，致使高深之醫學，止於中途，好學之士，願與事違。舊聞有荒蕪之慮，新知無創獲之期。此可爲太息者也，本會爲全國醫界之最高學術機關，似宜本發揚學術之立塲，爲救濟學術之要舉，督促政府於最短時期，可能範圍以内，添設規模宏大之醫學研究院，庶幾莘莘學子，不致廢止於中途，而醫學之昌明，或可並駕於歐美也。此其一。</p>
<p>（二）醫師法規草案之預備，政府於各業之法規，訂定而頒布者，十居七八，獨對於醫師法規，編至今未能頒布。向者全國醫師聯合會，曾以大會名義，電呈政府，促其早日頒行。顧言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，豈政府紛於他務，無暇及此耶？抑製定此項法規之人才不足耶？夫醫師法規無切實之訂定，則醫界之權利無保障之可能，此在政府雖可以等閒視之，而在吾醫界則固切身之急務也。竊以爲本會會員，多爲國内之開業醫師，而深明法律者，諒亦不居少數，此項法規之訂定，與其坐觀政府之遷延時日，久不頒行，不若由本會集中此項人才，搜羅此項材料，考之各國之成規，參以國内之現狀，製訂一「醫師法規草案，」然後上呈政府，以備採擇施行。蓋出於多數之意見，固可免牴牾不合之譏，而政府據之，亦可收事半功倍之效。製訂由本會，而頒布由國家，似與越俎代謀者有異也。此其二。</p>
<p>（三）醫育增長實習時間之建議　往者鄙人曾有「醫院學校化」「學校醫院化」之建議。蓋醫育之目的有二，一在於造就高深之學者，一在於産生治療之醫師。以言學術，則前者固不可輕，以言實用，則後者尤屬切要。蓋實用之科學，與徒事空言者有異，故學術經騐，兩皆不能缺一，而經騐則尤爲重要也。年内國内醫校林立，而究其設備，則合於醫育之原則者殊不多覯，普通醫校，多無附屬醫院，卽有一二有醫院者，而學生實習於醫院之時期，亦大抵開始於畢業之前二三年，似此短期之實習，殊難收若何之效果。畢業之後，出而問世，於是診斷之際，疑莫能明者多矣。鄙意醫院實習時間，至少須延至四五年以上，庶可收學理與經騐並重之效果，而與醫育之原則相符，蓋試騐期間，僅限於求學時代，開業以後，則决不能帶有絲毫之試騐性質也，本會於醫育問題，極端注意，近且有規定醫校課程標凖委員會之組織，若能本此目的，對於醫院實習之年限，加以延長，務使醫校學生畢業之後，有充分治病之經騐，或亦醫育前途之一助歟？此其三。</p>
<p>（四）醫學書籍之編譯　近數年來，政府鑒於外國書籍購買之非易，本國文字提倡之宜先，已通令全國學校，無論何種科學，其教本之用外國原文者，悉改易以國文矣。獨於醫學，尚未能收普及中文敎本之效。蓋以醫學爲最高深之專門科學，欲悉數易敎本爲中文，則必從事於外籍之繙繹，而國内所出之各醫學譯本，類多膚淺，故各校之採用原文者，仍指不勝屈也，本會有鑒及此，數年來對於醫學書籍之編譯，功作甚勤，惟鄙意則以規模尚嫌狹小，若能擴大其範圍，就財力之所及，以延聘此項繙繹之專門人材，從事於大規模之編譯，則其成績，定足驚人，而其收效匪可言喻，夫醫界派别之爭，由於留外學生言語文字之異，今若將各國之醫籍，譯爲國文，訂爲敎本，則言語文字，巳歸統一，紛岐之見，何自而生？且也歐西原籍，價值殊昻，寒素之家，力所不及，若有中文譯本，則自可人手一編矣。在本會則更可與此種偉大之工作，同歸於不朽，精神生存，莫此爲甚，此其四。</p>
<p>本會年來之成績，昭昭在人耳目，苟爲知者，罔不贊歎，非獨鄙人之「無間言」也。上述數點，所謂蒭蕘之見，一得之愚，以本會平素辦事之精神觀之，當亦輕而易舉也。</p>

<p>李情超醫師</p>
<p>在今日而言止劑，莫不推許嗎啡，及柳酸等，以其止痛力强而且速也，然而一則含麻醉性太强，有傷腦神經，且易成癮，甚至慢性中毒；一則應用多量，每易發生不良之副作用；如耳鳴，心跳，發汗等，是乃病人之痛苦未除，而先已受不快之感也。我常見普通人每於疼痛侵襲之時，非注射嗎啡針，卽多服阿芙蓉，希圖一時之安適，罔顧以後之危險，卒致中毒日深，不可救藥；夫藥物本以治人，今乃反以殺人，是豈醫藥家用藥之本意乎？故搜求一止痛之藥，具有嗎啡之特效，而無成癮傷腦之流弊，實爲當今醫藥家之急務，抑且爲萬衆所渴望者也！</p>
<p>自「凡拉蒙」問世以來，以前呻吟於床第，輾側不安之痛人，遂得解除其痛苦於極短時間内，其止痛功效之神速，誠有令人不可思議者，「凡拉蒙」不僅能解除病人之痛苦，且與病人以不少之便利：因此藥祇須内服，已足顯其功效，毋庸再求他人代爲注射其他含有危險性之止痛藥也。</p>
<p>吾人須知局部之痛苦，可能影響全身之健康，如喉痛而食不下咽，牙痛而不能咀嚼，均足以妨碍營養，引起消化不良，於是腸胃疾病卽隨之發生，豈可忽視！「凡拉蒙」對於一切因蛀牙，咽喉炎，而起之牙痛，喉痛，治之易如反掌，又如失眠一症，最易傷神，蓋失眠之原因：或由校頭痛，或由於神經痛，或耳痛等，正如俗說「一脈不和，全身不遂，」若得「凡拉蒙」以止痛，自能安然入睡，是則「凡拉蒙」間接又保障吾人之健康矣。婦女因生理之特殊，多增一層痛苦，卽經來時疼痛，及生産時陣痛是也。余猶憶有一産婦，在分娩時，陣痛過劇，而又不願注射，遂令其服用「凡拉蒙」，結果陣痛大减，而分娩則並未受任何影響；又近世對於尿道内患病時之疼痛，已放棄嗎啡及其誘導體，因其有時反能增痛，如用量稍大，又易引志嘔吐或噁心等不快副作用，故此時止痛之法，當以應用「凡拉蒙」最爲相宜。他如手術後或折骨時之疼痛，胆石，腎石痛，胃痛等，無論其如何劇烈「凡拉蒙」均能立卽制止，其功效且可保持數小時之久，此又非其他止痛之藥，所能望其項背者也！</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>我國自受外力積極之侵略，全國上下，始漸移目光，及乎邊境，深覺處斯潮流，不鞏固國防，卽無以立國，蓋所謂蠶食，所謂分割，率由邊疆而及中原，藩籬之重要，决不在堂臭之下也。</p>
<p>一二八之役，經國軍之艱苦奮鬥，抗戰經月，勳績昭著。當時民衆一心，士卒效命，固爲制勝之主要原因，但交通運輸，通信設備，於一髮千鈞之際，辦事人員，莫不甘冒險地，以取得聯絡，故軍事當局，能調度指揮，充分便利，而國際官傳，無遠勿届，亦能博得深切之同情。此種職務，原爲服務交通者所應盡，毋庸多所表白，不過卽此而論，足見國防與電信關係之重，故居今以言國防，若視爲鞭長莫及，卽首應發展交通，而發展交通中，建設道路，與聯絡通信，二者並重。</p>
<p>道路不涉本刋範圍，茲姑不加論列，至於電信交通，在我國西北及西南邊境者（東南沿海，注重海防，然我國亦有東北邊境，不過說亦可憐，已造成一個僞國矣。）可分爲有綫電及無綫電兩項。有綫電方面，自北平經張家口庫倫以通買賣城，爲聯絡蒙古之綫。自蘭州經肅州至吐魯番分兩道：一經迪化往伊犁及霍爾果斯，一經焉蕃往喀什噶爾及伊爾克斯塘，均爲聯絡新疆之綫。通青海者，由蘭州經平番至西寗，更與湟源貴德相接；通西康者，由川省之漢源接通康定。此外滇省邊境，自騰越經小辛街，以逹緬甸之八募，自河口以逹安南之勞開。桂省邊境，自南關以通安南之諒山；粵省邊境，由東興而通安南之河内。此其大槪情形也。無綫電方面，雲南新疆，均設有電臺。其餘西藏，蒙古，青海等處，尙少增設。據此以觀，關係國防之通信，合諸需要情形，亟應力圖發展；否則邊疆多事，而消息遲滯，欲求應付裕如，焉可得哉？</p>
<p>開發西北，鞏固國防，具此决心，卽應施設。歷觀報章所載，中樞要人，先後不辭勞瘁，奔走邊疆，實地考察，則將來建樹，定有可觀；惟就電信一端而論，以我國幅員之廣，邊陲之良，有綫電之敷設，成本旣重，工程又鉅，所可視爲通信利器，比較上似宜先着手於無綫電臺之建設。但邊疆設置電臺，需欵亦不在少，值兹電欵奇絀，詎能咄嗟可辦。聞交部初步計畫，巳實行在蘭州增加機器作西部通訊中心，更在綏遠張家口等處設立電臺，以與東南各地聯絡，斯舉對於西北通信，得不少便利，然亦不能謂卽此建設，巳爲滿意。竊以開發西北邊境，事關國計民生。水利農田之興辦，道路運輸之計畫，處處均需的欵，通盤籌措，能於的欵之中規定一部，作爲設備通信之用，庶幾基礎旣定，成功可期。至謂西北一帶，地廣人稀，荒凉待闢，内地人士，視爲長途，則聞交部方面，已定奬勵章程，凡前往邊疆工作之人員，均逾格優遇，此可見交部注意邊疆通信，固預定有整個計畫。所望全國上下通力合作，踴躍進行，須知發展邊境交通，興闢西北利源，亦卽所以鞏固國防門户。展望我國前途，斯固目前之急務也。</p>
<h3 id="c302">電報减價的眞意孫 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 漪</p>
<p>最近交通部規定，「每通電報收報人姓名住址，在十五個字以内者一律作五字計算。」這在發報人方面，似乎所省無幾；而在交通部方面，因此所受的損失，却很可觀。</p>
<p>本來中國的電報價目，比較東西各國貴得多。一般民衆，因爲太貴的原故，所以非遇到極要緊的事情，决不肯發一張電報。交通當局明白這一點，所以很想盡力減低。但是在此電政經濟奇絀的時期，如果把電報價目，減到同東西各國一樣，那簡直無法再維持下去。在無可奈何之中，想出這個變通辦法，一收報人姓名住址減字計費，雖然不能達到一般民衆的希望，但是比前便利多了！</p>
<p>電信事業（包括有綫電報，無綫電報，市内電話，長途電話，及無綫電話等）和一國政治，軍事，文化，敎育，經濟，金融，以及一切工商業的關係，非常密切，非常重大；而其原則，初不外乎便利民衆。所以這種事業，由國家經營，不像普通一般的工商業，專以牟利爲目的。卽使有虧本的時候，也要照常辦去。不過在東西各國，政府對於這一類事業，每年由國庫補助，只求事業的發展，而能達到便利民衆爲目的；决用不着錙銖計較。所以主管當局，儘可安心從事，力謀發展；電報價目，卽使低些，當然也不至於影響到事業的本身。同時，在另一方面，電報的價目一低，民衆自然樂於利用；發一通電報，幾同寄一封快信的代價，而電報傳遞的速率，究比信快得多。這樣，電報的用途，自然普遍；電報的用途，旣然普遍，電報業務，也自然會發達起來；電報業務，旣然發達，則電報價目雖低，而所受的損失，自然可以彌補。</p>
<p>可是我國政府，對於電信事業，向來不補助的，非但没有補助，在從前軍閥時代，擅派局長，剥削電欵，視電局爲税收機關，至今猶有餘痛！就是現在，軍政機關所欠的官軍電費，每年不下三百餘萬元。照全國電政收支的統計，年年都有盈餘；實際則年年不敷。這不敷的數目，就是受官軍電欠費的影響。近年來，因匪禍戰事的關係，以致原有的綫路，破壞不堪；而電政經費，又非常竭蹶，非惟不能擴充電信建設，卽就原來事業勉强維持，巳是困難萬分了！</p>
<p>在不久以前，電界同人，因電欵支絀，爲求維持現狀起見，曾經有電報加價的建議。其理由如下：郵資是巳經從三分四分加到五分了；火車票價，也比前巳經增加多了。郵政，鐵路，電信，同屬交通事業；况且郵資决不會受軍政機關的拖欠；鐵路有時雖受免票的影響，但所受的損失，决不會像電費那麽多。郵資和火車票價，尚且可以增加，電報又何嘗不能加價？但經交通部一再考慮的結果，非但不採加價的建議，并且還想法减少。其動機不過是使一般民衆，能感到拍發電報的興趣，不至像從前，視電報爲「不祥之物」。這種苦衷，當爲國人所共見了！</p>
<p>交通部這個辦法，實在是因爲電政經費支絀，是無可奈何之下的辦法。如果國内政治，上了軌道，官軍電報的欠費，有了相當的解决以後，一定還要把電報價目，逐漸减低咧。我們曉得，現在的電報局，已不像從前的衙門式了！在電報局工作的人員，也不像從前的官僚化了！電報傳遞的速率，和電文的凖確，也比較從前進步多了！打一張電報，的確能得到一張電報的利益，决不會像從前的電報，有時比信還慢些。如果人人能感覺發電的興趣，人人能充分利用電報，那末，電信事業，自然蒸蒸日上，而工商百業，也得逐漸繁榮了！這上，而工商百業，也得逐漸繁榮了！這纔是電報减價的眞意義！</p>

<p>— 觀</p>
<p>稱爲「則說通」實在「不算通」</p>
<p>用自動電話者，提起聽筒，持在耳邊，同時用手轉盤，以接通所欲通話之號碼，前篇所述，有所謂「達而通」者，噏噏之聲，不啻機械，認爲可以接達之意思；不過有時噏噏旣聞，也許轉盤之後，繼以「恨恨」，斷續悠揚，蜂鳴作響，斯發爲「恨恨」者，固不無表示一種遺憾也。「恨恨」云者，術語稱爲「别說通」（Ｂusy　Tone），「别說通」，實在是不算通！何以通而未通？則機械所發之「恨恨」，正無異在那裏通知用户，卽「需要的用户，方忙與别家通話，須稍待始可接達也」。</p>
<p>由此言之，自動電話，未通話前，每聞通聲（機械之聲），聲之通不一，而電話之可以接到與否，亦以聆得一達而通」或「别說通」而有區别。（共電式電話，亦有「别說通」，如此，司機生可以免說「綫忙」一句話。）</p>
<p>至於電話局内機械，如何發出「恨恨」之聲？當亦爲普通未明自動電話接綫情形者所欲知。簡短言之，（詳細接綫，容待後續）自動話機，隨用户自己撥號，局内機械，依而發生動作。至於撥號接綫，用户旣撥一個阿拉伯數字，機械卽就屬於這組的綫條中，擇其空閑之綫，接通至第二組，迨撥第二個號碼，機械也同樣選擇空棧，俾接通至第三組，如此層層推進，以接達所需之用户。如果一組中空綫，早經被用户完全佔用，或則所唤用户巳經接到，而正與别家講話，則用以選擇之機械，一轉移間，不與所忙之綫相連，而接至其他機械，經此機械之作用，，卽發出一種特别音浪，使斯際用話機撥號者，聞得恨…恨…之聲，不絕於耳。（恨恨之聲可絕，祗須放上聽筒耳。）</p>

<p>— 陳賢鼎</p>
<p>利用電話　方法新奇</p>
<p>歐人每稱丨丨瑞典爲電話天堂，該國鐵工業商會，近用電話欲舉行一執行委員會議。該會議計有代表六人，主席居瑞典京城司多克姆外，其他五人分居各城。内有數城，相距達五百英里。依普通辦法，必須集會都城，耗費多日。兹竟可利用電話，討論會務。討論之時，每個代表均可聽得其他代表之議論並得依次發言。旣省時間，復節費用，其方法頗爲新頴而切實用。據該會主席尼奥姆君宣言「開會之時，其討論情形，與圍坐列席無異」。其便利亦可想見。</p>
<p>據實行是項計劃之瑞典首都電話局工程司胡爾特君言，是項計劃理想上已告成功，一俟試騐完成，則對於籌備方面可更簡省不少手續。規定辦法如下，開會之前，必須先事在首都電話局接洽就緒。其通話時間，星期日及假期並無限制。其他各日，則規定以十五分點爲限。每個與會代表之通話費用，較普通長途電話費略爲增高。但瑞典京城與各大城市通話，其繁忙時間通話費，每三分鐘計美金二角六分（合華幣七角八分）。十五分鐘，亦不過美金一元三角（合華幣三元九角），並不過昻。且晨間九時以前及晚間六時以後，尚可享受半價待遇。若距離較短，則話費亦比較减低。自瑞典京城以至極北之拉普蘭，爲程約九百英里，每三分鐘之通話費，亦不過日間美金六角五分晚間美金三角而巳。</p>
<p>瑞典對於電話之新奇用途，尚不僅「電話開會」一種。瑞典京城之電話用户，若遇因事外出不能親接電話，其外也時間不論數小時或數星期，均可向話局要求將所有每次呼呌，均接至一專任話務員，將所有呼呌用户之號數，逐一記錄，如遇必要，並可囑其代接電話。用户歸家之時，卽可收到是項呼呌户號表及所囑代接電話之通信記錄。其費用亦極低廉，每次呼呌收費不過美金二分半而巳。</p>
<h3 id="c305">社會人士對於國際無綫電臺應有之認識（下） <a href="#c305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— 陳天佐</p>
<p>以言外交</p>
<p>各國辦理外交，除折衝樽爼，角逐坫壇之外，利用電信，以收宣傳之效，亦爲外交工具之一。藉國際電信以與駐外使領互通情報無論矣；卽聳動國際觀聽，轉移世界視綫；亦多利用國際電信，策外交上之成功。猶憶華府會議時，魯案成會議之焦點，爭辯之烈，空前未有，國民全神貫注，喜怒哀樂，悉憑情報；而呼籲請願，作外交後援，亦惟電信是賴。幸彼時美國太平洋水綫電報公司對於此項電報，均能迅速傳遞，得以信息敏捷，應付得宜。華府會議之得稍有結果者，國際通信予我國之便利，亦有力也。　當時會議不在美國，而國際通信，又因不能自主，受人掣肘，則結果更見惡劣，亦意中事。今國際電臺巳成立矣，他日有事坫壇，情報傳遞，運用自如，再無虞他人之扼我咽喉，此國際臺關係我國家外交者也。</p>
<p>再言軍事</p>
<p>國際間發生戰事時，則一國之國際通信機關，爲敵國所欲最先破壞之目的物，我國國際間水綫通信運用之權，悉操外人之手，一旦有事，此項交通利器，不爲我用，則攻守進退，無法與同盟國連絡一致，終不免爲國際戰爭壁壘上之大缺憾！卽有優越之國際水綫通信矣，而無强大之海軍力爲之防護，仍無用也。蓋水綫敷設海底，綿延萬里，重洋相隔，防護難周，故在我國現在海軍力薄弱之狀態下，建設國際臺以爲國防通信機關，實爲得計。因其佔地不廣，軍事的防禦易於措施也。今國際臺已成立矣，祇須有相當之空軍爲之維護，他日國際戰事爆發，無虞國際通信之阻斷，此國際臺關係我國國防者也。</p>
<p>國際電臺對於我國經濟·外交·軍事之關係，旣如上述。其業務之成績何如？此亟應一言者也。夫電信之傳遞，以迅速與凖確爲最要之條件。該臺所用機械，均係採用最新式之高速度自動收發報機。收發電報，均用機械，不憑人工，故其最高速率，每分鐘可達三百字左右。至於直達，電路，可通世界金市中心之紐約倫敦，以及舊金山·巴黎·柏林·日内瓦·莫斯科·馬尼拉·爪哇·西貢·香港·等大都會。每報傳遞時間最快祗需一分鐘。以言收發凖確，則該臺對於來去明密電報，派有專人精密校對，故三年來該臺收發電報計一千餘萬字，其中錯誤者僅一萬餘字，平均錯誤僅萬分之一而已，良以該臺同人深知大部份國際電報，關係商情，一秒鐘之遲延，一個字之錯誤，動關營業得失，出入極鉅，故皆謹敏從事。三年以來，該臺因奮勉邁進之結果，營業狀况，日見發展，現在國内外金融機關，進出口商，新聞社，以及各國駐華使領等，拍發國際電報，競交該臺傳遞，足徵社會上對於該臺信仰之堅，而該臺營業之日增月盛，誠非倖致。</p>
<p>抑又有進者，吾國國際地位之低落，爲不可否認之事實，但欲升高國際地位，是在全國上下，一致努力，有以表現。從前國際通信機關，尚未成立，則與海外消息往來，不得不忍痛以任利權之外溢。今國際電臺，權屬自主，對於軍事外交等關係如彼，其業務成績，又能猛進也如此，社會人士，如發國際電報而舍自主之國際電臺，斯豈愛國者所忍出此。敢爲正告，以企社會人士對於該臺之認識，且以勉該臺更進一步之努力也。</p>

<p>電報線路之調度</p>
<p>有綫電報綫路之調度，與報務之遲速關係綦鉅。如綫路調度得宜，報務卽可異常迅速。近來交部對於各省電報綫路，均照各地報務情形加以調度，兹將重要者探誌於後：</p>
<p>（一）上海清江浦自三月二十二日起用韋氏機直達通報，嗣後江北各處，與滬杭一帶往來電報當可特别迅速。</p>
<p>（二）平漢直達電路，前因順德彰德間電綫在戰時被軍隊毁壞，以致阻斷者數年於兹。現交部巳將該兩處間之電綫修理完畢，並飭令平漢兩局恢復直達通報矣。</p>
<p>（三）華北及華中與華南往來電報，以前有九江至廣州之直達電路轉遞，頗爲迅速。但自贛省共匪竊據後，九廣直達遂行阻斷。交部現爲救濟起見，特令湖南衡州與廣州開放直達，同時再在長沙衡州間加設電綫，以便開放粤漢直達云。</p>
<p>（四）上海與嘉興嘉善兩處往來電報，以前須經蘇州接轉，現自三月十九日起直達通報。</p>
<p>（五）安徽之屯溪與上海往來電報頗多，惟現在須經蕪湖及南京兩局轉遞，交部現爲使屯滬間電報迅捷起見，巳飭令蕪湖局與上海局直達通報，俾無須經南京轉報云。</p>

<h3 id="c312">我們應注意的市政選舉問題 <a href="#c312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>此次本埠公共租界工部局市政董事選舉已於最近畢事，而華人納税會市民組所選的代表亦於日前揭曉矣。在此次華洋兩方的選舉聲中，發現了兩種現象，這兩種現象，記者認爲深有討論的價值，特於本期先行提出，以後當次第的詳爲研究。事關市政進步以及培養民權初步的基本問題，究應如何提倡與推進，實爲本市全體市民及黨政當局所應十二分注意的一件事。</p>
<p>（一）關於第一種現象方面的，就是在工部局各外籍董事未産生之先，有位英文民樂週報主筆布蒙氏（Mr　A　W.Beanmont）發表一篇關於批評工部局選舉的言論，說上海市政是被某項潛勢力把持了。布氏的原文記者尚未覔到，但就各報記載的大意說，則布氏所言雖屬驚人，却係事實。布氏以爲「………彼因目擊上海公共租界市政之頽敗絕對不能與世界各大都會之市政進步相比擬，此種原因，雖爲上海市民之缺少市政進步思想，但歷來市政權之被某項潛勢力把持，如每屆工部局董事之改選，常爲某項潛勢力所指定之人選，且其名單，早經擬就，故市民之投票，直等具文，因此之故，所謂工部局董事者，終不外乎某大外商銀行之董事或經理，某猶太富商夾袋中之人物………因皆某總會之重要份子而自命爲租界特殊階級之人物，故人家謂工部局董事之産生出自會選而非市選，洵不誣也………」言之鑿鑿，是否嚮壁虚搆，實在值得研究。</p>
<p>（二）關於第二種現象就是華人納税會乃是代表上海市民之意志，爲上海市民謀福利的機關，上海市民對納税會的選舉應當非常注意，但是我們據報紙記載，此次華人選舉有被選舉權者爲三千餘人，而有選舉權者的人數當較此數增多幾倍以至幾十倍以上，可是結果所投的票却祇有二千餘票。這種現象，不獨表示一般人對於市政觀念的薄弱，以爲市政之良窳非自己所可左右，而且對於選舉的漠視心理，更十分顯著。</p>
<p>論到這兩種現象的内容，關於布氏認爲租界市政的頽敗，其最大原因是某項潛勢力之把持，而將市民「的缺乏民權初步的思想」反在其次的一層，記者的意見殊與布氏不同。因爲我們知道市政之頽敗固爲少數「特殊階級」把持之故，但是少數特殊階級何以能把持呢，那就不得不歸咎於上海市民對於選舉之輕忽了。如果上海有選舉權的市民，人人都能去踴躍參加選舉，對於人選十分注意，那少數特殊階級怎樣還可以操縱呢？所以，記者以爲少數特殊階級之所以能把持者，其唯一重要的原因就是市民不把市政當一回事，對於選舉更不當做一回事。在此種情况下而欲求剷除某項潛勢力，自非易易了。</p>
<p>其次，論到我們本身方面，則不特上述漠視心理較西人更甚又是一件極明顯的事實，而畏懼外國人的心理更於此可見。因爲租界向爲西人管理，一般市民早巳認爲無權干涉，對於華董事亦認爲是虚應故事，毫無實權。殊不知我國之受外國侵略，一方面固是帝國主義者必然的要求，而我們自己的自暴自棄，懦弱無能，致使外人能够得步進步，也是一個莫大的原因。所以，租界市政的不進步，其最大原因之一，也可說是我國市民對於納税華人會及代表的選舉不能十分重視，不能竭力做華董的後援。因此，歷來華董雖均係社會上優秀份子，但貢獻仍屬有限，不能竭力爲我國市民謀福利，不能盡力與外人抗爭。董事須市民不斷的鼓勵，盡力的爲後援，纔敢放胆做去，今大多數市民對於董事旣漠然視之，則做事便無力量，不能爲外人所重視，自然更談不上什麽抗爭的勇氣了。</p>
<p>總之，我們欲求政治之上軌道，必需人民眞正能够監督政治，參加政治；欲求人民參政之能澈底實現，先必須能上下一心的積極提倡培養與實施民權初步的工作。從這次華洋兩方的選舉情形上看來，最令人感觸的就是以熟習民主政治的西人，以及獲得新思潮較多的上海市民，對於選舉的認識尚且如此的薄弱，由此而推及我國各省内地的民治思想，則更可以想像到了。</p>
<p>今日政府中人每有大言民主政治，民主政治者，我們誠不知在這種現况下究應如何着手，而提倡民主政治者，在實際上又究竟做了多少提倡與培養的工作，這是我們於開始討論上海問題的時候，不得不有的一種連帶感想啊！</p>
<h3 id="c313">翻造房屋 <a href="#c313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣文桂</p>
<p>「老Ｘ！這裏的房子看來眞的靠不住吧！」是一個明媚的早晨，ＸＸ里的住民都在這樣交頭接耳的議論着。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：ＸＸ里的房屋，已有了二十年的歷史，外表雖然並不見得十分破舊，可是内容一斑，至少可以呈現出一副老相來：屋樑已有些歪斜了，地板已有些崎嶇了。</p>
<p>「翻造」的消息，已在二三天前傳佈了全里，可是因爲非正式的緣故，也不過狐疑胡議罷了。</p>
<p>昨天由里口的一家飯館裏，傳出一個消息來，說這兒的房屋，房東已肯定要拆了。所以能引起全里人注意的，就是因爲牠的小老板同房東是往來的知友。今天的情形全部變了，里内祗看見一堆堆的人在闊論着，看來形勢是緊張的多了。</p>
<p>終於在飯後一句鐘光景，房東的通知書宣佈了。這無疑地引起了全里人的恐慌驚愕，不期然的全里人都没有了勇氣，先前的議論已全都消滅了。</p>
<p>起先由一位烟紙店的老大先生，發起一個聯合會，先同隔隣的酒店老板商量妥當作爲臨時會所，再找了個糟坊老大做帮手，於是便開始進行了。</p>
<p>會是須聚集人材的，所以他們第一步工作便是聯絡房客。在前面的一帶店舖，已先後得到了他們的知照，可是在内進的幾排住宅，便不在他們勢力範圍内，要聯絡，並不像理想一樣地便當，可是也不能不聯絡。</p>
<p>在内進的幾排住宅中，比較有些聲望的，要算是小學校長和一位老練多能的朱先生。因爲他倆都是智識份子，所以人家對他們的信仰崇奉，是很可以捉摸得到的。</p>
<p>當然囉！爲要鞏固聯合會起見，這兩棵柱子是不可缺少的，因此，關於住宅方面的工作，概由他倆負責。</p>
<p>第一天下午六點鐘光景，這聯合會便在這樣糢糊中成立了。酒店式的會堂，擠滿了各家的巨頭，不約而同的都現出一副似哭非哭，似笑非笑的苦臉，其實在這時候，也並没什麽可笑。</p>
<p>各家有各家的境遇，各人有各人的苦衷，在這一個小團體産生之後，誰不想訴說？這一個小會堂裏，不用說已鬧得够耳聾了。</p>
<p>「諸位！我們這次所以要在這裏大家會面的理由，不過是要想聚集我們大家的力量，來抵抗房東這一次的「翻拆」。但是蛇無頭而不行，我們須得找一位</p>

<p>(Beiping) Linhe telegram: Sun Dianying's troops, numbering 30,000, under pressure and enticement from the Jin-Sui Army, were completely disarmed within three days. The firearms and ammunition surrendered by Sun's troops at the San Sheng Gong (Three Saints Palace) are piled up like mountains. The exact number has not yet been determined, but it is roughly estimated that even a thousand trucks would not be able to transport it all. Except for the bandit Yang Hou, who fled through San Sheng Gong, no one else escaped the net. Yang's bandit gang is now being attacked by rear echelon troops and has been routed, with his chief of staff, Nan Jingchen, captured alive and executed on the spot. Several small groups of Sun's troops, with other intentions, fled towards eastern Chahar through the Mongolian grasslands in the back mountains, unwilling to be reorganized. They are now being surrounded and disarmed by the Jin-Sui Army. Wang Jingguo is currently at San Sheng Gong handling the disarming. Men Bingyue and Zhang Xuanze will depart on the 30th to assist in the counting, verification, and distribution of funds. (31st)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Military Affairs Commission received a telegram from the Qingdao Municipal Government about the inside story of a plainclothes team in Qingdao plotting mischief, stating that on the morning of March 23, according to a tip, Liu Linsen, Sun Zuochen, Ge Shenzhai, and others colluded with ronin and prepared to riot in Qingdao on the evening of the 24th. The Public Security Bureau dispatched teams successively in the afternoon of that day and arrested Liu Senlin, Sun Zuochen, Hu Maoxiao, Sun Huating, and others. They were interrogated strictly, and personnel were sent to the Japanese Consulate to explain the situation and make serious representations. The consulate agreed to take action and stated that if it was found that Japanese were involved, they would be ordered to be sent out for interrogation. According to the initial confession of Liu Senlin and others, they were instigated by Ge Shenzhai to recruit people on his behalf, and they did not know the details. After repeated interrogations, they admitted to colluding with certain ronin. However, their statements about preparing a riot were still evasive. The investigation and interrogation are continuing. The local area is currently as quiet as usual. (31st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>All Workers at Huaxin Go on Strike</p>
<p>Zhao Dazhong leads miners in continued parades and demonstrations.</p>
<p>Representatives of Dongsi Mine Workers Detained in Tangshan by Zhao</p>
<p>Heavy Military and Police Security in the Area</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 30th, over a thousand male and female workers at the Huaxin Textile Mill in Tangshan went on strike. After the strike, the workers organized a maintenance team, electing 27 male team leaders, 7 female team leaders, and 200 maintenance team members. They are maintaining order in various departments of the factory and protecting all factory property. The workers still go to and from work on time, but the workers who go to work only stand in their original work positions and do not work. The Huaxin Textile Mill is the largest textile mill in the war zone. It recently reduced the number of workers, reduced wages, and increased workloads, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers. Influenced by the Tangshan miners' strike, they went on strike and made the following demands to the factory on the 30th: (1) Replace the factory's main personnel who abuse the workers; (2) Restore the previous working conditions; (3) Increase wages in accordance with the three-year wage increase precedent. On the 30th, Zhao Dazhong went to the Huaxin Textile Mill and gave a speech to the striking male and female workers, telling them to unite and persevere to the end, and that the Tangshan miners would provide support to the factory workers, so as to fulfill the factory's conditions. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 30th, Tangshan City was quite tense due to the Tangshan miners' parade and the Huaxin Textile Mill workers' strike. The Public Security Bureau and the War Zone Security Team closed their doors and were on high alert. Shops closed their doors early, and the people on the streets were all workers from the two striking parties. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 30th, the Tangshan miners, upon receiving a letter from Zhao Xun, Director of the Public Security Bureau, declining to mediate the labor dispute and canceling the proposal to allocate compensation for the injured and dead, were greatly agitated. Therefore, at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon, they gathered in front of the Caishen Temple again, where Zhao Dazhong ascended to the heights and gave a speech, denouncing Zhao Xun for his insincerity and deceiving the workers. After the speech, they paraded, each worker carrying wooden tools, knives, and small red and yellow flags with slogans written on them: "Down with Zhao Xun," "Down with the unreformed trade union," "We don't recognize the unreformed trade union," "Down with the untrustworthy Director of the Public Security Bureau." They shouted slogans along the way, passing Guangdong Street, the Public Security Bureau, West Ma Road, Xinli Street, East Xin Street, and the Grain Market Street, and returned to the union at 4:00 p.m. to disperse. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tangshan Rickshaw Pullers' Union was established on the 30th, with Zhao Dazhong as the chairman. They plan to take advantage of the fact that a rickshaw puller was injured by a stray bullet from the Public Security Bureau police to make things difficult for the Mining Bureau and the Public Security Bureau. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 30th, Yao Mingshan, a representative of the Dongsi Mine workers in Kailuan, was sent to Tangshan to persuade the striking workers to quickly repent, exercise self-respect, and quickly resume work, but was detained by Zhao Dazhong. Zhou Fengqi, a barber who was detained by the striking miners in Tangshan, was released on bail of 1,000 yuan on the 30th, but he was covered in injuries. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Representatives from factories in Malanyu and Qinhuangdao have all arrived in Tangshan to contact Zhao Dazhong, intending to form an autonomous joint branch of workers in the war zone. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tangshan Huaxin Textile Mill is affiliated with the Tianjin Textile Mill. Upon hearing the news of the strike, the Tianjin factory has appointed manager Zhou Shutao to handle the matter. Shareholders have stated that they have been losing money for years and cannot afford to support it. If the labor unrest does not stop, they will shut down the business. In addition, the factory authorities have investigated and found that the Tangshan labor unrest is purely aimed at destroying the industrial production mechanism of our country, so the striking workers of the Kailuan Tangshan Mine incited the workers of the textile mill to strike. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce said that the Kailuan strike is still serious. In order to prevent its expansion, they have jointly telegraphed the Beiping Military Affairs Commission and the North China Political Affairs Committee, requesting them to send troops to protect the area and send personnel to mediate and find a solution.

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese have recently been recruiting workers in various parts of North China and transporting them to the northeast, the Beiping North Korean Camp area. Most of the farmers have responded to the call, and they are all transported to Rehe via Gubeikou. The Military Affairs Commission recently sent Councilor Zhao Ganchen to Gubeikou to investigate. Zhao returned to Beiping today and reported to the authorities. It is said that 5,000 people have been transported to Rehe, not for road construction, but to be incorporated into the army. After this news spread, many people fled back. Today, 400 to 500 farmers who fled from the North Korean Camp arrived in Beiping. It is said that the reason for the Japanese recruitment is a kind of preparation against Russia. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from outside the pass said that the situation between Japan and Russia is still tense recently, and both sides are making unremitting military deployments. It is reported that the Japanese plan to blockade Vladivostok with the navy to block the sea route to Soviet Russia. However, the Greater Khingan Mountains in the northwest are long and mountainous, making it difficult to march. Therefore, the main objective is to focus on the line from Dolon to Kutuy, so that it can directly lead to Chita, forming a large encirclement. Recently, they have been actively constructing transportation in Rehe Province, extending the Jin-Chao line to Chengde in order to facilitate military transportation. Because there is a shortage of coolies outside the pass, they have sent personnel to sneak into the pass to recruit Chinese workers to work outside the pass. (31st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Japanese army occupied Rehe, eastern Mongolia has been difficult to manage due to its vast territory. The Japanese are now determined to implement a plan to merge it and decided to change Rehe Province into a "dao" system, and change the local areas belonging to various leagues and banners into counties, reducing the territory under the jurisdiction of the Mongols. After this reform, the land managed by the Mongols will only be one-tenth of what it was before. Mongols live by herding, and in the future, the reduction of land will inevitably cause difficulties in their lives. It is said that the Japanese have set July 1 as the date for implementation. The Russian side is also intensifying its military deployment, concentrating a large part of its army west of Vladivostok. Because the Japanese army crossed the Greater Khingan Mountains and cut off the Siberian transportation, it has stationed a large amount of air force on the northern border of the Greater Khingan Mountains. They are also adequately prepared for the Japanese plan to spy on Chita from Kulun. Soviet Russian personage Molotov will go to Kulun on April 1 to inspect. (31st Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e15">New Trends in International Diplomacy - Zhen <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The international situation is clouded with uncertainty. Whether in Western Europe or the Pacific, the current state of peace appears difficult to maintain. An examination of the great powers' military expansion and the current state of international diplomacy reveals a glimpse of this. For example, since Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations, its form has been fragmented. In addition, Italy's advocacy for reorganization has plunged Europe into irresolvable disputes. Even worse, Italy has individually exerted its strong-arm tactics, bringing Austria and Hungary under its control. It has firmly expressed its intention to reject Germany and has also clearly demonstrated its hegemonic ambitions against France. In the past, Germany's withdrawal from the disarmament conference was not without the thought of using Italy's hand to weaken France's dominance in Western Europe in order to revise the Treaty of Versailles, which it had always opposed. As a result, although it has gained some support in diplomacy, there is practically no benefit. The damage may be even greater than expected, as Germany did not expect Italy to be able to concretely assist Austria in restricting Germany's actions. However, the independent understanding between Germany and Poland is not without its advantages in German diplomacy. This further forms a confrontation between France, Italy, and Germany, and the European situation is increasingly entangled in disputes.</p>
<p>Secondly, the sudden change in the Far East issue, namely the dispute between exclusive control and open door, is no longer as bad as before, at least forming a blunt situation. The conflict between Britain, America, and Japan coming from Beijing, in general, the possibility of political understanding between Britain and Japan is greater, but economic interests are difficult to coordinate. The intensity of market competition is far from comparable to before the 1914 Russo-Japanese War. The conflict of economic interests between the United States and Japan does not seem to be very urgent, but the difficulty in reaching a political consensus and the intensity of the struggle for hegemony in the Pacific cannot but make people fear. The current situation is serious. At present, the dispute between Britain and Japan over the textile market has not been resolved, and the diplomatic relations between Britain and Japan have also been shaken. The United States and Japan have instead gained some diplomatic understanding. US Secretary of State Hull's exchange of documents with Japanese Ambassador Saito Hiroshi, as well as the confirmation of Philippine independence, seems to temporarily ease the conflict between the United States and Japan, and the war in the Pacific will be postponed for some time.</p>
<p>At the time of the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, general observations all believed that in addition to the usual promotion of commerce and the increase of American foreign trade, it must contain some political meaning. Sure enough, Soviet diplomacy has become more assertive. From Stalin, Molotov, Litvinov, and other political officials to military leaders such as Voroshilov and Galen, they have all issued strong warnings against Japan. Following this, the relations between the Soviet Union and Japan are not only feared to deteriorate, but there is a real possibility of war breaking out. But it is known that the United States has suddenly revised its diplomatic policy. There is no further intimacy in US-Soviet diplomacy, and the Far East issue remains as it was before. Now the United States has recognized the independence of the Philippines, so Japan can turn its naval competitive force to the management of the continental arms race.</p>
<p>Based on this trend, the following analysis can be made of international diplomacy:</p>
<p>First, the international coordination diplomacy after the European War will become a historical relic in the future. The Locarno Security Pact, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, the Paris Pact of Non-Aggression, and other forms of international cooperation will gradually be dissolved and will no longer have any binding force. Even negative moral constraints will be equal to empty talk. Except for temporary special functions, they will no longer be valued by the powers. At the same time, all international issues in the past sixteen years have tended to be resolved through meetings. Although meetings may not necessarily be fruitful, resolutions may not necessarily be implemented. However, the railways of European countries are mostly filled with the traces of important diplomatic figures, and the opinions of various countries rely more on meetings to alleviate the uneasy situation. They especially rely on the power of meetings to temporarily stabilize the situation. In the past, the form of international meetings has gradually become a thing of the past, and diplomatic negotiations and independent alliances will turn to a new trend in the future.</p>
<p>Second, judging from the examples of the cooperation between the three countries of Zhunyi, Austria, and Hungary and the tendency of improved diplomatic relations between the United States and Japan, the current situation of various countries mostly tends to return to the old state before the war. International cooperation has been abandoned, and alliances have also formed a new situation. Although the original intention of alliance and weakening the enemy's power is not much different, the urgency of the means and the ingenuity of the intentions are more thorough and rapid than before the war. Because on the surface, they are still unwilling to publicly break the situation of international cooperation, but in reality, the attempt to cooperate and the goal of peace have long become historical fossils. Today, what is used is how to benefit one country's interests. The reason why international relations are not completely negated is that the convenience of transportation today and the excess of demand have made it impossible for any country to close its doors and be self-sufficient. It seems that it is less possible to attempt to dominate alone. Therefore, in addition to political alliance movements, there is also economic alliance. However, the more serious this tendency, the more bizarre and dangerous the changes in international diplomacy will be, and the more difficult it will be to hide.</p>

<p>Committee System Adopted, Submitted to Chiang for Approval</p>
<p>Chen Jitang and Li Zongren to Serve as Chairman and Vice Chairman Respectively</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The organizational regulations for the Southwest Military Council, drafted by Miao Peinan, Chief of Staff of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Headquarters, adopt a committee system. The committee members will concurrently be the Commanders-in-Chief of various bandit suppression routes. There will be one Chairman and one Vice Chairman, with Chen Jitang as Chairman and Li Zongren as Vice Chairman. This organization has been telegraphed to Chairman Chiang for approval. Since Chen Jitang's Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army entered Jiangxi and Fujian, the opening of roads has required a large amount of funding, and the cost of bridge and culvert projects has been insufficient. After requesting the Economic Council to allocate 50,000 yuan for subsidies, it was still not enough. A second telegram was sent requesting a further allocation of 50,000 yuan for bridges and culverts. The Economic Council has agreed to allocate the funds as requested. (31st Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Darjeeling The Tibetan government is now trying to persuade the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet. If this move succeeds, it will have a far-reaching impact on the Nanjing government's desire to consolidate its influence in Tibet. A delegation of the Tibetan government, composed of 50 Tibetan monks, leading many servants and carrying many valuable gifts, arrived in Kalimpong (transliteration) today, heading to China to welcome the Panchen Lama. The delegation hopes to accompany the Panchen Lama back to Tibet before the reincarnation of the deceased Dalai Lama. According to Tibetan belief, the Lama can only be reincarnated nine months after his death. If the Panchen Lama returns to Tibet with the delegation, he will become the teacher of the new Dalai Lama. It is not yet known what impact the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet will have on the Tibetan government's policy towards China, but it is expected that it may produce a trend towards cooperation with the Chinese government. It is reported that two Japanese Lama monks have arrived in Lhasa, disguised as Tibetans, passing through Nepal. (30th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Vice Minister Yu Feipeng of the Ministry of Communications returned to Nanjing on the 31st to take up his duties after going to Jiangxi at the call of Chiang a few days ago. According to him, the trip to Jiangxi only lasted two days and was purely a private matter with no specific mission.

<p>Deeply Afraid of Discussions on the Manchuria Problem</p>
<p>Hull Issues Another Statement to Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Army authorities are very concerned because of the possibility that the Manchuria problem will be raised as an issue at next year's Washington Conference. (1) It is quite clear that China, based on its traditional policy and the relationship of the problem with the Nine-Power Treaty nations, will exhaust all means to raise it as an issue at the conference. (2) Judging from the fact that Japan withdrew from the League of Nations due to the Manchuria problem and the current trade pressure against Japan, the countries participating in the conference are expected to be more sympathetic to China than at the 1921 Washington Conference. (3) Not only the League of Nations member states but also countries around the world recognize that Japan's attitude during the Manchurian Incident violated the Nine-Power Treaty signed at the First Washington Conference. Even from a theoretical point of view, China's appeal cannot be rejected. Therefore, the Army authorities anticipate the above as important bases for the possibility of raising the Manchuria problem at next year's Washington Conference. Currently, they are earnestly studying countermeasures on how to deal with it. Soon, they will propose to the Second Washington Conference Countermeasures Consultative Council of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Navy, Army, and other related authorities, which will be established soon, and strongly assert it. As for the opinions among the authorities in charge, it has been decided as follows: No matter how sweet the words or fine language used to encourage the Manchuria problem to be an issue at the conference, if it is agreed, it will directly hinder the development of "Manchukuo" and disrupt peace in East Asia. Therefore, it must be resolutely rejected. For this reason, the inviting country should be independently inquired beforehand as to whether the issue is on the agenda. If it is confirmed that the issue is not on the agenda, but it is suddenly raised after participating in the conference, the Japanese delegation may withdraw immediately. (31st Day Electric News)</p>
<p>(Washington) The American business community requested the State Department to designate March 31st as "Admiral Perry" Memorial Day to commemorate the first signing of the Japan-US Treaty of Amity and Commerce (i.e., the Treaty of Kanagawa) between US Admiral Perry and the Japanese government on March 31, 1854. Secretary of State Hull has recently accepted. Hull issued a statement on this issue today, stating, "The treaty signed by Admiral Perry laid the foundation for the establishment of relations between Japan and the United States, upon which the two countries' consolidated friendship and mutual interests were built. The relationship between the United States and Japan is similar today to what it was eighty years ago, based on friendship, and this is true not only for Japan but also for other countries." Hull continued, "The United States and Japan are also following the same path in industry and commerce, not harming each other but seeking the common welfare of mankind," and so on. Before 1854, Japan pursued a policy of national isolation, discriminating against foreigners. It was not until this year that US Admiral Perry led a fleet to Japan, knocking on the door and entering. At that time, Japan had no strong armor or sharp weapons and knew that it was powerless to resist. Therefore, it began to sign the Treaty of Kanagawa with the Americans, opening up maritime trade. (30th Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) A bulletin issued today by the British Foreign Policy Association stated that the documents recently exchanged between Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota and US Secretary of State Hull did not indicate that the United States had changed its policy of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." The bulletin was quite critical of the exchange of documents between the diplomatic authorities of Japan and the United States. The bulletin said that the nature of these documents is to change the psychology of the people of Japan and the United States and to ease the tense situation in the relations between Japan and the United States since the establishment of "Manchukuo," so it is very important. Moreover, the fact that Hull's reply was delayed until after March 3rd and that the publication date was necessarily delayed until March 21st was all to inform us that the United States' policy of non-recognition of "Manchukuo" was not affected by the letter.

<h3 id="e43">League of Nations Fears Far East Problem Will Lead to Second World War <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Japan Dominates East Asian Situation</p>
<p>Britain and America May Cooperate to Deal with It</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations believes that if urgent steps are not taken to ease the tension in the Far East, a second world war may not be far off. According to sources within the League of Nations, the first countries to participate in the war would be Japan, the Soviet Union, and China, and Britain and the United States would inevitably be drawn into the vortex sooner or later. The League of Nations' prediction is based on its study of the causes of war. Geneva predicts the main reasons for the war as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The United States, China, and Russia will resist Japan's attempt to create political and commercial hegemony in the Far East.</p>
<p>(2) Japan's actions in Manchuria undermine the balance of power stipulated by the Washington Naval Conference of 1922.</p>
<p>(3) Due to Japan's intention to demand naval parity at the future naval conference to be held in 1935, the naval construction competition between Japan and the United States will intensify.</p>
<p>(4) Relations between Japan and Russia are gradually entering a turbulent period, as can be seen from the recent strong attitude expressed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(5) The expansion of Japan's foreign trade and Japan's insistence on the Asia Monroe Doctrine have made Britain deeply uneasy.</p>
<p>(6) China refuses to recognize the Japanese-controlled "Manchukuo," which was originally China's Northeast Three Provinces.</p>
<p>(7) Japan formally declared its withdrawal from the League of Nations in 1935, and Japan declared its continued trusteeship of a majority of islands.</p>
<p>Observers predict that an accident will inevitably occur in Japanese-Russian relations this spring. Tokyo and England are also creating an atmosphere of war, and conflicts on the border between the two countries may cause an accident. According to experts familiar with the Far East situation, Japan must abandon its Monroe policy in the Far East, but Japan is unwilling to do so. Therefore, the only result is that Japan and Russia will meet with soldiers. The outcome of the war is, of course, closely related to the United States. If Japan wins, the United States must decide whether to participate in the war or retreat, and let Japan monopolize the interests of the Far East and China. According to the League of Nations, the United States has not yet decided on its steps in this matter, but as a precaution, the United States has decided to strengthen its navy to the extent permitted by the treaty. Most well-informed observers believe that the US military in the US plan will never have the opportunity to fight against Japan, because the Washington government will eventually carefully consider the cost and benefits of the war. However, this is tantamount to the United States recognizing Japan's position as the master of the Far East, and abandoning China's open door policy from now on. Most diplomats believe that the United States will eventually swallow its anger and withdraw from the Far East, so as to concentrate on the development of politics and commerce in Latin America. If the United States does not need to make an urgent decision this year, the United States will eventually have to decide on its policy at the naval conference in 1935 at the latest. According to diplomats in Geneva, the foundation of the United States' Far East policy has been completely destroyed by Japan's atrocities in Manchuria. In other words, all Pacific treaties similar in nature to the Washington Naval Treaty are now regarded as waste paper. It is said that the Nine-Power Treaty has been undermined, because the signatory countries have no way to deal with Japan's infringement of China's sovereignty and territory. Japan's actions in Manchuria have been victorious, so Japan has become the master of the Asian continent, and the balance of power in the Far East presided over by the Washington Treaty has been destroyed. Furthermore, in order to maintain its new position in the Pacific, Japan is now requesting naval parity from Britain and the United States. The League of Nations is deeply afraid that if Japan's demands cannot be satisfied, there will be no hope of re-signing a new treaty after the expiration of the London and Washington treaties, and the inevitable result will be naval competition, but the cost will be incalculable. In the same uneasy area as the Far East Treaty structure is the intensification of economic competition in the Far East. Japan, through its own competitive efforts, feels the tension in its relations with other countries, especially Britain. Japan's victory in seizing foreign markets and Japan's competition with Britain on maritime routes have made Britain unable to forget the Far East. Some parties believe that Britain and the United States may cooperate to promote Japan's awareness, so as to avoid bloodshed and war. (30th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Tank Manufacturing Self-Sufficient</p>
<p>Results of the Five-Year Industrial Plan</p>
<p>Moscow News, The Soviet Army is making every effort to mechanize and modernize its troops. The peacetime strength of its tank force is roughly as follows: 4 tank regiments, 3 independent tank companies, 6 independent tank battalions, 2 independent tank companies of security force divisions, 6 independent tank companies, and 8 tank companies attached to sniper divisions. The regiment consists of 2 light tank battalions, 1 heavy tank battalion (each battalion is composed of 3 companies formed by heavy and light platoons), and an education battalion (1 heavy and 1 light company). The platoon was originally 3 tanks, and is currently being reorganized into 5 tanks. In addition to focusing on the enrichment of the tank force, the Soviet army is also keen to build mechanized troops to ensure various services. The mechanized vehicles necessary for this type of troop have always been supplied by imports. Recently, as a result of the five-year industrial plan focusing on the development of domestic heavy industry, the development of automobiles has shown a significant trend. In 1931, the domestic factory's tank manufacturing volume was approximately 500 vehicles. At present, the tank force of the Soviet Far East forces is approximately 300 vehicles east of Chita.

Okada also said that if the British and Japanese cotton industries can continue to exchange opinions with a fair and frank attitude, they will definitely understand each other's positions and stances, and permanently enhance friendship between each other, in order to achieve the expected goals. However, this issue is really difficult and requires the greatest patience and effort. After a long period of discussion and contact, a solution can be obtained.

<p>(Tokyo) The British-Japanese cotton textile negotiations that have now broken down may be handled by the British and Japanese governments through diplomatic means. According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, the Japanese side does not object in principle to the British side's suggestion that the British-Japanese cotton textile negotiations must be handled by the British and Japanese governments, but the Japanese government does not want to take any action until the British government has new suggestions to break the current deadlock. The only reason for the breakdown of the British-Japanese negotiations lies in the issue of region. The Japanese side wants to limit the region, while the British side wants to expand it. Because neither the British nor the Japanese side can compromise, mediation is impossible, and the meeting breaks down. Currently, the Japanese delegation is still staying in London. As soon as the negotiations are changed to be presided over by the British and Japanese governments, they will set off to return home. (31st Reuters News Agency)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito is scheduled to leave Tokyo Station at 7:30 pm today to go west. After spending one night in Shizuoka, he will visit Prince Saionji in Okitsu on the morning of the 1st. It has been a year since the Prime Minister visited Prince Saionji last spring regarding the issue of withdrawal from the League of Nations. This visit will report on the recent political situation, international relations, and the progress of the parliament, and explain the cabinet changes. It will also reveal that the current cabinet has been in office for two years, and has completed the mission of forming the cabinet, such as handling the May 15th Incident and handling international relations after withdrawing from the League of Nations, although there are unsatisfactory points. However, the public is now tired, and I also feel tired. I intend to resign at an appropriate time to inquire about Prince Saionji's intentions. Prince Saionji will definitely persuade him that there is no suitable successor before this extraordinary time in 1935 and 1936, and that he can continue to take charge of the current situation. Therefore, the Prime Minister decided to remain in office and return to Tokyo in the afternoon. After the Jinmu Emperor Festival on the 3rd, he will supplement the cabinet members. The Prime Minister will negotiate with Suzuki, the chief secretary of the Seiyukai, and then make a decision. However, it is questionable whether a suitable candidate for the Minister of Education can be found from the Seiyukai. Alternatively, a Minister of Education may be found from among the Ministers Minami, Goto, and Matsumoto, and then a member will be supplemented by the Seiyukai. (31st Dentsu Telegraph)</p>

<p>British Empire Trade Still Has Not Improved</p>
<p>(London) The British Financial Times analyzed the results of the first year of the Ottawa policy, saying that the exchange of goods within the British Empire has improved slightly in some respects, especially between Britain and South Africa. However, as a whole, British Empire trade has not expanded significantly. After the general situation improves, the Ottawa policy will definitely have good results, which can be seen from the trends in early 1934. In 1933, the import of goods from other countries within the British Empire to the United Kingdom totaled £249,450,000, an increase of £1,300,000 compared with 1932. The export of British goods to other countries within the Empire totaled £163,000,000, a decrease of £2,000,000 compared with 1932. The reason why imperial trade has failed to respond to the encouragement of the Ottawa policy is that British trade with South Ireland and Hong Kong has decreased significantly.

<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon's reply in the House of Commons on March 19 regarding the continued construction of the Canton-Hankou Railway loan was misrepresented in some respects. Reuters has recently published the original text of the British Foreign Secretary's reply as follows: Conservative Party Rankin asked whether the government would make it a condition of approval that the £1.5 million loaned from the British Boxer Indemnity to complete the Canton-Hankou Railway project, that the materials required for the railway must be procured from the United Kingdom within the possible range. British Foreign Secretary Simon replied, "I know that the Boxer Indemnity Management Committee is now considering a proposal to pay half of the British Boxer Indemnity to the Management Committee in accordance with the provisions of the 1932 Chinese Boxer Indemnity Act as collateral for raising debt. The income of the loan will be used for the construction of the Canton-Hankou Railway, not for foreign materials. However, the implementation of this project will result in the London Central Government Purchasing Committee ordering a large number of railway materials and equipment from the United Kingdom.

<p>Insurull Detained by Turkish Authorities</p>
<p>United States Requests Extradition</p>
<p>Turkey Hesitates</p>
<p>Constantine The former master of the world of finance, Mr. Insurull, has been hiding overseas since his business failed and he lost a huge amount of money, and the US government issued an arrest warrant for him. He moved from Greece and planned to hide in Romania, but when the ship passed through the Bosphorus Strait, he was detained by the Turkish authorities. After receiving a note from the US government requesting the arrest of Mr. Yin and sending him back to the United States for interrogation, the Turkish government has asked the US ambassador to show him an arrest warrant. After checking this document, it will decide whether to extradite him. In about twelve hours, the question of whether Mr. Yin can continue to enjoy freedom outside the law can be resolved. The Turkish government has agreed in principle to arrest Mr. Yin. If there are no special changes, Mr. Yin will soon be arrested and sent back to the United States for trial. Although the Turkish-US extradition treaty has been signed, it has not yet been ratified by the Turkish Congress. Before it is ratified, Mr. Yin will of course not be extradited, but it is heard that the Congress will probably approve this extradition treaty today. At the same time, Mr. Yin's lawyer will make a legal argument to the Turkish government. The US authorities' request for extradition has raised an important point of contention in international public law, because whether a ship flying a foreign flag sailing in the Bosphorus Strait is within Turkish territorial waters is a question. (30th Reuters News Agency)</p>
<p>Constantine Everyone expected that Mr. Yin Suer would disembark today afternoon, and at the same time, the Turkish government is exchanging diplomatic opinions with other countries. It is heard that the Greek government has instructed its minister to Turkey to ask the Turkish government what reasons Turkey has for detaining the Greek ships hired by private individuals. Will Turkey's arrest of Mr. Yin create a dangerous precedent for the international community? Turkey is quite hesitant about this. (31st Reuters News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is heard that the Turkish government has decided to answer the United States in favor of extradition in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of the Criminal Law on permitting extradition, and will send Mr. Yin Suer to the US Consulate. However, according to routine procedures, a final decision can only be made after the Stanbul Court discusses it this afternoon, and it will be immediately reported to the Turkish government. In short, it has been determined that Mr. Yin Suer will be arrested and sent to the US Consulate. (31st Havas News Agency)</p>

Britain and France have made considerable progress in their negotiations on national security. The extent of the progress has reached the point where Britain is considering asking President Roosevelt to abandon his non-interference attitude on the "European problem" in order to complete the agreement to monitor the armaments of various countries. It is said that the negotiations between Britain and France are tending towards Britain guaranteeing France that it will use economic force to sanction those who "undermine the proposed armaments."

<p>Italy's Disarmament Proposal is Closest to France's</p>
<p>Outstanding Issues Between the Two Countries Cannot Be Resolved by Empty Words</p>
<p>(Paris) "Paris Evening News" published an interesting interview with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, which briefly stated, "The Italian-Austrian-Hungarian Tripartite Protocol signed in Rome is the beginning of cooperation between Central European countries. No country's disarmament plan is closer to France's disarmament proposal than Italy's. The name of the disarmament conference is actually inappropriate and should be changed to 'Conference on the System of Arms Limitation Ratio.' Those European countries that feel the pain of the current territory regard the revision of the peace treaty as a problem that remains unresolved. When we signed the peace treaty, we never thought that the content of the treaty would be immutable for eternity. As for the relationship between France and Italy, it has now improved, but there have been outstanding issues between the two countries for fifteen years. If we want to resolve them, we must have sincerity and be realistic, and empty words will not help. There will be no war in Europe in the near future. In short, it is not the pan-political system that causes the war to break out, because Italy has many construction projects that cannot fulfill its responsibilities without peace."

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia Around the 15th of this month, it was rumored that two trains full of military supplies crossed Austria on March 8 and 9 and were transported to Hungary. Austrian officials have strongly denied this statement, but detailed news has been received here that proves that Italy secretly supplied military supplies to Austria and Hungary. This news will be published by the "Political News of the Southern Capital" tomorrow. The main points are: "On March 9, a train arrived at Sangandito on the Italian-Austrian border, with 18 freight cars, 4 of which belonged to Austria and 14 to Italy. There were many Italian soldiers escorting the train. As soon as it arrived at the border, the train was handed over to members of the Austrian Patriotic League. The Austrian freight cars were covered with canvas. When they arrived in the Lin area, the cloth covering the cars was replaced. It is not known what was hidden inside. In the other Italian freight cars, the upper layer was covered with cauliflower, but someone saw that under the cauliflower, there were four armored military vehicles and various military uniforms. After this train entered Austria, it first stopped near Vienna. It is not known whether it was transferred to Hungary or stayed in Austria. In Klaz and Praina, military transport was also discovered. Ten days ago, 15 aircraft flown by Italian pilots flew to Darlehof in Austria. Afterwards, the Italian pilots all returned home by train. The aircraft were manufactured by the "Fiat" factory (a famous Italian manufacturer of automobiles and aircraft), with 750 horsepower. Aircraft parts were also transported at the same time, 12 of which were equipped with machine guns. Italy has supplied 48 aircraft to Hungary." (30th Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) – Ai Chengmei, the first wife of Gu Renfa, resided in San Tiao Xiang, Drum Tower, in Nanjing. Since the Gu-Li affair occurred, she had intended to hire a lawyer to sue Gu for bigamy. However, someone from Zhenjiang came to persuade her to drop the matter. Since the morning of the 30th, Ai was invited out and has not returned as of the 31st. Ai's fellow townsmen in Nanjing are searching for her everywhere, but there is still no news. It has been learned from the Jiangning Court that Ai Chengmei has not yet filed a lawsuit with the court. According to the Criminal Procedure Law, a lawsuit against a husband for bigamy must be filed in the court of the defendant's location or where the crime was committed. Therefore, Ai would have to sue her husband for bigamy in the Zhenjiang Court or the Wuhan Court. Another report says that Ai originally intended to sue Gu for bigamy in Nanjing. However, after this became known to Zhenjiang, Zhang and Yang were specially dispatched to Nanjing to mediate with Ai and persuade her to leave Nanjing and not file a lawsuit. Ai had no choice but to go to Shanghai by car with Yang and Zhang. (March 31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) – After Gu Renfa returned to the province, he did not meet with the provincial committee members. Most of the furniture in his private residence has been moved to Nanjing.

<p>Sun Initially Had No Determination to Attack Ningxia</p>
<p>Officers and Soldiers All Wept Upon His Departure</p>
<p>Fu's Trip Was Also Full of Difficulties</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence - Fu Zhan魁, who was tasked with persuading Sun Dianying to step down a month ago, spared no effort and trudged through the Hetao Desert, experiencing several days of food and water shortage. He finally completed his mission with perseverance and returned to Beiping on the 27th. Sun Dianying was originally traveling with Fu, but at about 1:00 AM on the morning of the 27th, while passing through Datong, Yang Aiyuan, commander of the 34th Army garrisoning Taiyuan, dispatched by Yan Xishan, welcomed Sun to Jin on behalf of Yan. Sun got off the train at that place. After meeting with Yan in Jin and making arrangements for his family, he will choose a day to come to Beiping and send his Secretary-General Liu Zenruo with a letter from Sun to Fu to pay respects to Chairman He and Sun's friends in Beiping to thank them for their kindness in maintaining the army. Fu and Liu arrived in Beiping at 4:30 PM on the 27th. Many of Fu's friends and Sun's former subordinates came to welcome them at the station. According to Fu's account of the journey,</p>
<p>"Sun is a man of generosity and righteousness, and he values promises. The conflict with the Ningxia army was unexpected. After the engagement, the two armies were in a stalemate, making it impossible to stop. After receiving the central government's order to stop advancing westward, Sun immediately intended to withdraw his troops. However, the two armies were in a stalemate, and it was necessary to consider the safety of his subordinates. The central government did not explicitly order the Ningxia army to abandon its intention to fight Sun, so Sun repeatedly asked the central government and the Military Affairs Commission to send senior officials to the front line to monitor and prevent the Ningxia army from pursuing Sun. Under the guidance of the senior monitoring officials, Sun obeyed the order and retreated backward. In the middle of this, the senior monitoring officials were delayed in being dispatched, so the retreat of Sun's troops was also delayed, and there were unavoidable clashes between the two sides during this period. Commander Pang and others, due to friendly relations, sent a telegram to Sun with gentle advice. After receiving Sun's reply, I (referring to himself) was asked to meet with Sun. Chairman He also believed that a military solution would inevitably harm the local area and also agreed with me going to persuade Sun to step down. I know Sun well, so I went on a mission despite the hardships. The traffic in the Hetao area is extremely inconvenient. South of Dengkou, it takes three days of travel, and there is not a single village along the way, making progress extremely difficult. The round trip took a month, with twenty days spent walking.</p>
<p>I met Sun on the 10th of this month in Ligangbao. After Sun saw me, he immediately expressed his sincerity without any doubts or demands. Everything was done in accordance with the orders of the Military Affairs Commission. The tens of thousands of officers and soldiers of the department were all trained by Sun, and they shared hardships together for more than ten years. Although Sun is a military commander, his enjoyment is the same as that of the soldiers. Therefore, in his army, the relationship is like that of family and fathers and sons. This time Sun resolutely resigned, and the entire army was reluctant to part with him. When Sun set off, the officers and soldiers all wailed and cried. Sun and the officers met each other before departure and cried bitterly all night. I was on the sidelines and also felt the pain of separation more than death. Under such a passionate environment, Sun resolutely gave up, which is truly admirable. Sun's generosity and righteousness are well known. This time he left the army, he did not have a single penny on him, nor did he ask the government for money. In order to appease the families of his subordinates, he specially telegraphed his friends in Beiping a few days ago to mortgage all his private property in Beiping to borrow 24,000 yuan to send to Baotou. For each family of those who had dependents left in the area, 20 yuan was given to each family. 17,000 yuan was distributed in one night. The remaining 7,000 yuan was also distributed to the officers who came with him. The officers strongly kept 2,000 yuan for Sun to use, but as a result of the distribution, 5,000 yuan was still not enough to distribute everywhere, so Sun took out his 2,000 yuan and distributed it again. As far as I know, Sun has absolutely less than 500 yuan in his hands. For more than ten years, his subordinates have suffered hardships and followed him because of Sun's righteousness.</p>
<p>My mission was only to persuade Sun to step down, so I did not ask about the military tunnel. Wang Zhongquan and Zhang Xuanze, two staff officers from the Military Affairs Commission who went with me, have stayed on the front line to monitor the centralized reorganization of Sun's troops. The Military Affairs Commission ordered the department to withdraw north of Shizuishan to await reorganization, but there is nowhere to stay in the 200-odd li between Shizuishan and Dengkou. If they want to withdraw north, they must withdraw to Dengkou. In fact, they cannot stop south of Dengkou. Ding Futing's troops are now 15 li outside Ningxia City, while Liu Yueting and others are gathering near Shizuishan. Transportation in the Hetao area is extremely inconvenient. The journey took many days. Telegrams took three or four days to arrive. Since the 41st Army was disbanded, the Military Affairs Commission's radio station does not receive telegrams from the army, so they must be forwarded from Taiyuan or Chairman Fu, so there are fewer telegrams.</p>
<p>The journey this time was as follows: On the 4th of this month, I set off from Baotou and arrived in Wuyuan in the evening. On the 5th, I arrived in Linhe. On the 6th, I arrived in Sanshenggong. On the 7th, I arrived in Dengkou. The car could no longer be used, so I switched to sedan chairs and horses to travel on the canals and small paths and in the desert. I only traveled dozens of li a day. On the 8th, I arrived in Heguazi, which is the bend of the Yellow River. On the 9th, I arrived in Shizuishan. On the 10th, I arrived in Ligangbao. I had to pass outside Pingluo City and was still shot at by the garrison in the city. I telegraphed Sun my itinerary every day on the way. As soon as I arrived, Sun also rushed from Zhengjia Oil Mill. After seeing each other, he immediately decided to leave the army with me. However, because he was dealing with matters in the military headquarters, and I was waiting for a telegram from the Military Affairs Commission, I started to move first on the 16th. I arrived in Dengkou by car on the 18th. In order to avoid passing through Pingluo, Sun rode a horse to catch up. I received a telegram from Sun on the 19th, inviting me to travel with him in Dengkou. He rode slower, arriving on the morning of the 22nd. Then we traveled south together. I met Wang Jingguo in Sanshenggong, saw Fu Zuoyi and Zhao Chengshou in Linhe, and only stayed in Baotou for one day. This time when I returned, I saw that the canals in Hetao had thawed and the water was rising. If I was not careful, I would fall into the canal. There were four days on the way when I did not eat hot meals, but only filled my stomach with dry food. I dared not drink water for three days. The water there is more turbid than the water in the drains of Beiping, and the shores are full of dead camels and excrement. I really dare not drink it." (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Expanding the Organization <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Appointment of Personnel for Two Departments and Six Sections Already Determined Internally</p>
<p>Party Affairs Funds for Three Provinces Still Disbursed from Provincial Treasury</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Commander-in-Chief Chiang relocated his headquarters to Nanchang, the General Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces has been managed by Chief of Staff Cao Haosen and Qian Dajun, who successively acted on his behalf. When Zhang Xueliang took office as Deputy Commander-in-Chief, he assumed full responsibility. Zhang took office on March 1st and went to Jiangxi on the 7th to meet with Chiang. In addition to discussing post-bandit suppression measures and the deployment of various military defenses, it is said that they also discussed the issue of expanding the General Headquarters' organization. On the 13th, Zhang returned to Hankou from Jiangxi and went to the General Headquarters every day at 8:00 AM to work. The organization of the General Headquarters has been decided to be expanded, roughly divided into the First and Second Departments and six major sections. It is said that the personnel appointments have already been internally determined and are planned to be implemented on April 1st. Zhang's Yamen will be moved from Hankou to the East Garden of Xujiapeng in Wuchang, which has now been renovated and will be moved into soon, making it more convenient to work at the General Headquarters in the future. The Hankou Yamen will still be converted into an office. Zhang is making great efforts to rectify internal staff, immediately planning to establish a "General Headquarters New Life Movement Promotion Association," leading by example and setting an example for the military and political organs of the three provinces. An English class will also be established, stipulating that staff practice Tai Chi from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, study English from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM, and practice soccer, tennis, and basketball after 5:00 PM, in order to enhance their knowledge and improve their physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The General Headquarters previously issued a summary of Party affairs reorganization in the three provinces, stipulating that the expenses of the provincial Party headquarters of the three provinces and the Hankou Special City Party headquarters should be self-sufficient from Party members from the 23rd year onwards and no longer drawn from the provincial treasury. Because it has not been done during the bandit suppression period, on the 29th, Commander-in-Chief Chiang telegraphed Zhang Xueliang and the governments of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, ordering that they still be disbursed from the provincial treasury according to the original plan. The original telegram said, "Deputy Commander Zhang in Wuchang, Chairman Zhang, Chairman Liu in Kaifeng, Chairman Liu in Anqing, I have reviewed Article 10 of the Provisional Outline for the Reorganization of Party Affairs in the Bandit Suppression Area promulgated by this Headquarters, which originally stipulated that the expenses of the provincial Party headquarters and the special city Party headquarters should quickly plan for self-sufficiency, and after the 22nd year, they should no longer be disbursed from the provincial treasury. Now, according to the Central Party Headquarters Secretariat's respectful telegram, the Central Finance Committee meeting stated that during this bandit suppression period in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, Party affairs are important, and the expenses of the provincial and municipal Party headquarters are still difficult to handle on their own for a while. In the 23rd year, the Party affairs expenses of the three provinces should still be transferred to the three provincial governments to include them in the budget as before, in order to maintain the status quo, etc. What is said is still true. Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Government also asked whether the provincial Party affairs expenses for the 23rd year should be listed as before, and I have instructed that they should still be temporarily included in the budget. The matter of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui is the same example. In addition to replying to the Central Secretariat, I hope that they will be temporarily included in the budget separately. Signed by Chiang Kai-shek." (March 30th)</p>

<p>He, Liu, and Others Meet with Zhang in Hankou to Discuss Post-Affairs</p>
<p>Zhang Fang Telegraphed that Bandit Leader Ma Xiyou Had Been Killed in Action</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Liu Zhenhua, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Border Area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, went to Jiangxi a few days ago to meet with Chiang and report on the bandit situation in the border area. He then came to Hankou on the 28th in response to a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang. On the 29th, he met with Zhang once and discussed the post-bandit suppression plan and troop command matters. On the same day, Chairman Chiang telegraphed Liu and various generals, ordering them to completely eradicate the remaining bandits in the border area, only Wu Huanxian and Xu Haidong, with a total number of no more than three thousand people, within one month, seeking to annihilate them as soon as possible. After Liu led the order, he went to the Yamen again on the 30th with He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang and discuss everything in detail. Chief of Staff Qian Dajun of the General Headquarters also participated in the meeting to decide on the methods for carrying out post-bandit suppression. Liu plans to go to the border area to inspect in a few days, and then return to Liuan to supervise the suppression. Various division commanders, such as Liu Maoen and Dai Minquan, originally planned to come to Hankou and Jiangxi to meet with Chiang and Zhang for instructions, but because of the deployment of military affairs, they all stopped leaving their defenses. Sun Lianzhong, who came to Hankou, has already gone to Jiangxi the day before, and Liang Guanying will also go. It is said that a certain unit in the border area has recently joined the suppression, and the elimination of the remaining bandits is not a problem. As for the ten bandits in southern Henan and northern Hubei, Wang You and Ma Xiyou, etc., who fled to western Henan, Zhang Fang is supervising the troops to pursue and suppress them. Zhang telegraphed Director He Chengjun on the 29th to report the victory, saying, "According to a telegram from Deputy Division Commander Li Qin (27th), the bandits Ma and Wang were severely attacked by our 453rd Regiment and artillery battalion in Xindian on the 24th. The bandits fled east from Bao'an. On the 25th, they went to the southern end of Liudian, where our engineering battalion was opening to the south, and engaged in a battle for two hours, killing and wounding dozens of bandits. They turned north and fled to the Zhaocun area north of Jiuxian. Our artillery and engineering battalions followed and pursued them. At 10:00 PM that night, taking advantage of the bandits' fatigue, they bravely rushed in and engaged in hand-to-hand combat for two hours, killing more than 200 bandits, capturing more than a dozen alive, and seizing 43 rifles and 47 mules and horses. After the battle, the bandits unexpectedly gathered their remnants and launched a counterattack on three sides. The attack was extremely fierce. After another four hours of fierce fighting, the deputy of our artillery battalion and dozens of officers and soldiers were killed and wounded. The bandits still could not hold on and fled southwest. According to the captured bandits, the reason for the desperate counterattack was that the bandit leader Ma Xiyou was killed in this battle and they were trying to get his body, etc. Now our 453rd and 456th Regiments and artillery and engineering battalions have all reached Yexian. According to reconnaissance reports, the remnant bandits have fled to the Weiwa area southwest of Baofeng, but today there is a heavy snow, making it difficult to advance, etc. In addition to ordering the inspection of the corpse of bandit Ma Xiyou, I have also ordered them to follow and pursue the bandits to ensure that they are all annihilated."

<p>The Provincial Government Plans to Implement Important Policies</p>
<p>Various Military Shortages Ordered to be Replenished</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The bandit suppression military affairs in Fujian Province have been very smooth recently, but in terms of politics, due to financial difficulties, there has been no progress. The provincial government recently received a telegram from Chairman Chiang ordering it to actively carry out four important policies: measuring land, checking household registration, establishing Baojia, and building highways, in order to complete the task of advancing both bandit suppression military affairs and politics, and setting a deadline of April to prepare detailed plans and submit them for approval, to be started in May and completed by the end of April next year. After receiving the order, the provincial government immediately summoned the heads of the civil affairs, construction, and finance departments, as well as the section chiefs and secretaries of the security office, to hold a joint meeting at the provincial government on the morning of March 28th. Secretary-General Gao Dengting chaired the meeting to discuss the implementation methods and decided: (1) Land measurement will be handled jointly by the civil affairs and finance departments, with the civil affairs department drafting the plan. (2) Household registration will be checked by the civil affairs department. (3) Baojia will be established jointly by the security office and the civil affairs department, with the security office drafting the plan. (4) Highways will be built by the construction department. The draft plan for each item should be divided into three parts: overview, steps, and expenses, and should be prepared before April 15th and submitted to the provincial government for review. The important policies recently handled by the provincial government include the case of setting up administrative commissioners in different regions, which has already drafted regulations for the commissioner's office, and the compilation of the estimated budget for the 23rd year, which can be completed by the end of March and must be submitted for discussion at the provincial government meeting on April 4th.</p>
<p>In terms of military affairs, the national army stationed in Fujian has already been dispatched by the Nanchang headquarters to send Cai Jilun and Kong Jianchang to Fujian to form an inspection committee with the East Road General Headquarters, divided into two groups, southern Fujian and northern Fujian, to start the inspection. However, the 39th Army under Liu Heding is newly established and only has jurisdiction over the 56th Division (Liu also concurrently serves as division commander), the 52nd Division under Lu Xingbang, the newly編 10th Division under Zhou Ziqun, the newly編 11th Division under Chen Zhaixuan, and the newly編</p>

<p>The two師under Zhang Luanji have only one brigade each and have many vacancies. Now, according to the order of the Military Commission, all are allowed to expand their establishment. The method is to place the newly編 12th Division under the jurisdiction of the 39th Army, combining it with the original 56th Division of the army, for a total of two師. The four師under Lu Xingbang, Zhou Ziqun, Chen Zhaixuan, and Zhang Luanji will each be expanded by one regiment, combining the original three regiments to form four regiments, divided into two brigades. The candidates for brigade and regimental commanders can be announced within days. However, regarding the supplies for the four師, the Military and Political Department only allows each師 to be issued 20,000 yuan per month, and the remaining 40,000 yuan is to be borne by Fujian Province. The provincial government believes that the finances of Fujian Province are extremely difficult. Recently, it has編 12 security teams, which require 240,000 yuan per month, which is already difficult to plan. It is impossible to bear the 160,000 yuan of military pay. The two sides are still in consultation. (March 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Inspection Record of Xinjiang by Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent, Geng Ya <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident and the Japanese forcibly occupied our Northeast, the Chinese people have felt the urgency of the national crisis and have begun to look to the frontier areas. Therefore, the call to "develop the Northwest" has resounded across the clouds. Liang Rengong once said, "The fertile coastal areas are being devoured by tigers. In the event of war, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong will bear the brunt. In less than five years, all will be like Taiwan, abandoned in haste, and no cries will be heard. Even with strong weapons, they will only increase the enemy's food supply. Even with wisdom and courage, they will be helpless. Therefore, talking about wealth and strength while living in the southeast is like gorging oneself in front of a butcher's door. Although it is a little pleasant, one will never get meat. Only the northwest hinterland is far from the coast, with few foreign traces and undeveloped land. Greed comes a little later, and the abundance of mines and products, taking any province as an example, can all be self-sufficient." Zuo Zongtang also said, "Rebuilding Xinjiang is to protect Mongolia, and protecting Mongolia is to defend the capital. The northwest arms are connected, and the situation is complete, leaving no gap to be taken advantage of. If Xinjiang is not secure, Mongolia will not be safe. Not only will the borders of Shanxi and Shaanxi be threatened, but the mountains north of the capital will also have no peace." The northwest is our country's hall and treasury, and Xinjiang is especially the screen in the middle. Mongolia and Tibet are like lips and teeth. Reading the words of the two gentlemen can give a general idea. Moreover, Xinjiang was once a trading place for eastern and western civilizations, and in the future, it will reopen its meaning as a transportation route between Europe and Asia. The land is vast and the products are abundant, with an area of 4,947,700 square li, which is two-fifths of the area of the eighteen中部 provinces, one and a half times larger than Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, fourteen times larger than Jiangsu Province, and fifteen times larger than Zhejiang Province. The population is 2,552,000 (according to the Ministry of the Interior in the 20th year), and the distribution density is an average of one person per two square li. Compared with the population density of Jiangsu Province, it is 190 times smaller, and 100 times smaller than Zhejiang. The more dense the population of the inland, the more impoverished the livelihood, while Xinjiang has vast land, fertile soil, and a sparse population, which makes it easy for foreigners to invade. In the 16th year, Hu Hanmin traveled in Europe and the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs asked Hu, "Why does China still ignore Xinjiang? If it is delayed any longer, Xinjiang will no longer belong to China." As we face the breaking of our rivers and mountains and the shrinking of our borders, we reread these words and cannot help but shudder. Now, in order to quickly mend the fold and do our respective duties, our newspaper has sent a special reporter to inspect Xinjiang, hoping to contribute to the people of the country with what we have learned, in order to have a clear understanding of the frontier situation and to promote the early realization of development plans, which I think will be welcomed by our beloved readers and supported by the people of the Northwest.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Leaving Shanghai to Go to Beijing to Obtain a Passport <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>According to the "Incentive Measures for Chinese Citizens to Investigate the Border" promulgated by the Ministry of the Interior in the spring of the 20th year, Chinese citizens who investigate the border, whether individually or in groups, should apply to the Ministry for an investigation passport. On February 22nd, the General Management Office of our newspaper submitted an investigation application, along with a half-length photo of the reporter, to our newspaper's Beijing office to apply for a passport. Because the procedures were incomplete, the application was returned and submitted to the Ministry of the Interior by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The reporter went to Beijing on March 6th to wait for the passport.</p>
<p>On the day of departure, I visited people from all walks of life who are very concerned about the Northwest issue. I was very grateful for their enlightenment and encouragement, which benefited me greatly. Li Zhichu (Du), a general of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army, still affectionately remembered the soldiers stationed in the Northwest. He said that there had been no news from the remote area for three months and asked me to send a message, saying, "The Northeast has not been recovered, and Southern Xinjiang and Western Sichuan have also been troubled. Looking to the future, I am extremely worried. My comrades, survivors of the war, stationed in the Northwest, make people even more worried and restless. Recalling the past, the two places should have the same feelings. Now that the country is in trouble, all my comrades should still strive for the country with the spirit of resisting aggression. Du and his comrades should encourage each other." A fervent enthusiasm for worrying about the times and loving the country leaped onto the paper. That night at 12 o'clock, I departed on the Shanghai-Beijing through train from Shanghai North. The train was equipped with heating pipes, and despite the howling wind at night, there was no chill. The third-class seats were also very neat. There was also a small table under the window for drinking tea and writing. The first and second classes were even more comfortable, not to mention. This is enough to give passengers satisfaction. After arriving at Xiaguan, I got off the train and left the station. I saw a newly opened square, with a small garden planted with flowers and trees in the middle, and cars, carriages, and rickshaws lined up on the side. The order was still good, but the rickshaw pullers were very fierce in soliciting customers. If you take a so-called "wild chicken car" (the rickshaw puller claims it is a small car, to show the difference from a public bus), you can send four or five passengers to Xinjiekou or even the Confucius Temple for two dimes each. Taking other cars costs more. The area near the station, as well as the area from Rehe Road to Zhongshan Road to Xinjiekou, used to be dilapidated ruins, but now many have become magnificent government offices and tall 洋樓 banks. Other empty land and vegetable gardens are also planted with wooden signs saying "New Site of Bank XX" or "Construction by Construction Company XX". The atmosphere in Beijing is changing day by day, and the population is increasing sharply (from 250,000 to 726,000 since the capital was established). The banking industry is particularly developed, which can be seen generally.</p>
<p>The well water in Beijing is salty, and the price of river water is high and not clarified, so there is a lack of drinking water. Some people even ignore hygiene and draw water from ponds. Now the municipal government has established a government-run tap water system and set up 75 water stations in the busy street corners of the central and southern parts of the city. Each担of water (two 洋 oil barrels) costs three copper coins. The streets and alleys in the east and west of the city are narrow and inconvenient for laying water pipes, accounting for about half of the city. It is being gradually promoted and will soon be popularized. This is indeed beneficial to people's livelihood, and people praise it very much.</p>
<p>In recent years, government offices have been building extensively, and important people are competing to build villas, with flying eaves and beaded curtains, which is very spectacular and also a new show of the capital.</p>
<p>After unloading my luggage at the Datong Apartment, I visited the Ministry of the Interior and met Secretary Jiang Suishi. I asked about my passport and learned that it had not been forwarded because the procedures were not complete. I then sent a special letter to Li Dachao, the section chief of the Shanghai Municipal Government, asking him to expedite the inquiry. Later, I received a reply that it could be sent immediately. Then I visited Gong Bicheng, the director of the Xinjiang Provincial Office in Beijing. He received me cordially and said, "This trip is very meaningful and I highly approve of it. However, the situation in Xinjiang is slightly different from that in the interior. Before going to Xinjiang for investigation, you must first be investigated and approved by this office and telegraph the provincial government authorities. After receiving a welcome reply, you can enter the country unimpeded." I expressed my compliance to Mr. Gong and thanked him. Then I visited Wang Ruyi and Wang Shu, counselors of the National Government, Ma Hetian of the Ministry of Personnel of the Examination Yuan, Li Xiaochuan, a senator of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, Jiang Jingzhai, a section chief of the Ministry of Industry, and An Han, an executive member of the Northwest Construction Committee. We had in-depth discussions on the key points of the Northwest issue: (1) Developing the Northwest is the fundamental plan to save the country and the nation. Stabilizing Xinjiang is the first priority in developing the Northwest. (2) The crisis in Xinjiang today is no less than that in the Northeast before September 18th. (3) Xinjiang has a complex ethnic makeup. If it is lost, it will be more difficult to recover than the Northeast. (4) Those who aspire to work in the Northwest must have the same degree of philanthropic spirit as missionaries. They must not have the mentality of corrupt officials who exploit the people.</p>
<p>To investigate the border, you should have a passport. To go to Xinjiang, you must first apply to the authorities of the province for approval before you can travel. These procedures must be completed in advance to avoid delays and obstacles along the way. Now, I will extract the 17 articles of the "Measures for Rewarding Chinese Citizens for Investigating the Border" of the Ministry of the Interior as a warning to those who follow: (1) Anyone in this country who investigates the border (temporarily limited to Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Tibet, Xikang, Yunnan, and Guangxi), whether individually or in groups, must fill out three copies of the investigation application in the prescribed form, together with four 2-inch half-length photos, and send them to the local government for transfer to the Ministry of the Interior for review. (2) Students or professors of colleges above the specialty level may submit the application for investigation directly to the Ministry for processing by the president of the school where they are located. (3) If there is any doubt about the review, they may be ordered to come to the Ministry for an interview. Those who are far away may be questioned by the local government and reported. (4) If the review is approved, the Ministry will issue an investigation passport and a report form, and will notify the Ministry of Railways to issue a half-price train ticket. (5) After the Ministry issues an investigation passport, it shall immediately notify the administrative head of the border investigation area, and order his subordinates to protect and assist him. (6) When the investigator arrives at the border, he shall report to the local government, present his passport for verification, and report to the Ministry for verification. If he wishes to extend the investigation area or period during the investigation, he shall submit another application to the highest official in the border area for approval, and shall also report to the Ministry at the same time. (7) After the examination is completed, he shall submit the investigation situation and investigation opinions to the Ministry for review. If it is found that there are special achievements, he may apply for a reward.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Story of Zeng Shangyuan, an Overseas Chinese Kidnapped in Xiamen, Escaping <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Rescued by Garrison Troops in Tianzhu Mountain</p>
<p>Zeng Recounts His Kidnapping and Escape</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Zeng Shangyuan, a giant businessman in Xiamen who returned from Yangon and is the chairman of the Singapore Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation, was kidnapped on the night of March 17th on a ferry from Xiamen to Gulangyu. He was rescued on the 27th by the 36th Division of the Tong'an Garrison Troops near Tianzhu Mountain, at the border of Tong'an and Changtai. One of the bandits monitoring Zeng was asked by Zeng to carry Zeng's handwritten letter to Zeng's house in Gulangyu to report the news. Zeng's son, Yangwang, took the letter to Tong'an to report to the garrison troops to rescue him at the address. After Zeng escaped to Tong'an, he talked about his kidnapping and escape, saying, "I left the Daqian Hotel on the evening of the 17th. When I got on the ferry to Gulangyu, I saw two people in the boat first. I asked the helmsman Lin Tianguo and the driver Xu Hanguo who they were. They said they were their friends and wanted to take the boat to Gulangyu. I (Zeng said himself, hereinafter the same) thought they were Lin's own partners, so I didn't suspect them. In the middle of the river, I happened to look back and saw a small sampan being towed behind the ferry. I asked Lin again whose boat it was. Lin replied that it was his friend's boat, which was attached to carry passengers to Gulangyu. I was suspicious. Four people suddenly jumped out of the bottom of the sampan's cabin, all with weapons. I knew something was wrong. The four had already jumped over the ferry. One person stuffed my mouth with a bag of white powder and pointed a gun at my chest. At that time, the two people who were in the ferry first also took out guns, one monitoring the helmsman and one monitoring the driver. Then the electric boat went straight to Dalu Island between Songyu and Dongyu, passing the ship inspection office of the Water Police Bureau. The water police used a flashlight to shine on the ferry and asked where it was going. The bandits replied that it was going to Gulangyu. In fact, the route was absolutely inconsistent. If the water police had noticed that it did not match the direction and ordered it to approach for inspection, it might have been saved at that time. After passing the inspection ship office, the bandits fired a shot near Dalu Island and shattered the glass of the helmsman's room. This is the reason why there were bullet marks, bullet casings, and white powder in the empty boat that was later obtained. After arriving at Dalu Island, the bandits helped me ashore. More than 20 bandits were waiting. From there, they were taken to a thatched hut, where they lay dormant with the bandits for three days and nights, because Dalu Island is opposite Xiamen, fearing that the matter would be strictly monitored after it happened. On the morning of the 20th, I was moved to a sailboat. The bandits took two sailboats and set sail. At that time, the helmsman and driver Lin and Xu were not seen. The boat passed Bengpingwei in Yuandang Port, north of Xiamen City, and was stranded on the sandbar in front of the Asia Oil Depot due to low tide for a day. From morning to night, the Xiamen embankment and downtown area could be seen remotely. Unfortunately, no patrol boat arrived all day, so no one noticed that it was stranded on the shore of Xiamen all day long. When the tide rose in the evening, it continued to sail, passing Baozhu Island, and landing in Wu Guan. The mountains along the way to Xinyang Xiayang were rugged and difficult to walk. I was old (Zeng was 63 years old), exhausted and unable to support myself. During the past few days, they moved east and west, moving around in four places, all within the territory of Tong'an. Finally, they went to Tianzhu Mountain on the border of Tong'an and Changtai, the highest and most dangerous peak of the mountain, and lived there. At the time, one of the bandits said, 'Your helmsman and driver only know us and are not accomplices. If you go home one day, please don't make things difficult for them.' But I don't know if this is true. But judging from the past, the two are indeed suspicious. After living in the mountains for four days, four bandits guarded me day and night. One of the bandits was forced to become a bandit and had the intention of helping me. He said that his brother was a good citizen, had a family, and his property was worth 2,000 yuan. When I heard this, I thought I had a chance and asked him to ask his brother to be a liaison and told him that if he could escape, he would be rewarded handsomely. He agreed. His brother then brought a letter to Xiamen and gave it to my son Yangwang. After receiving the letter, my son came to Tong'an on the evening of the 26th and asked the 215th Regiment of the 108th Brigade of the 36th Garrison Division to send troops to retrieve me. Regiment Commander Liu Ying immediately sent a company of about 150 soldiers, led by the bandit who was entrusted to buy me and his brother. They arrived at Tianzhu Mountain before noon on the 27th. At that time, the bandits were out, and only two bandits were guarding me. The two people who reported the news fooled them and killed them. I was then rescued. At 3:00 PM on the 27th, I took a car to Tong'an and stayed at the house of my friend Ye Zibo," and so on. Zeng returned to Xiamen from Tong'an on the 29th and lived in his private house in Gulangyu, refusing to see guests. Because of the labor and fright of the 11th, he was old and sick. The officials and officials discussed that the bandits who helped Zeng and their brother each received a reward from Zeng. It is said that the bandits sent a letter to Zeng's family demanding 200,000 yuan in ransom, but now they were rescued by the official army. It was a great fortune in the misfortune. (March 30th)</p>

<p>The Sen Tai Wood Shop outside the East Gate of this city, which has recently closed down, has an apprentice named Zhu Youquan, who is just a young man. He is from Pinghu. In recent years, he and a woman surnamed Dai and a woman named Xiaomeitou outside the East Gate have been communicating with each other and discussing marriage. However, the woman surnamed Dai must wait for a son-in-law to be recruited, and the family of Xiaomei is religious and does not marry outside the religion. Zhu Youquan asked his friend to mediate with both parties. As a result, the woman surnamed Dai was more affectionate, and Zhu Youquan was willing to be recruited as a son-in-law. He then sent a letter to his family in Pinghu to seek consent, but was rejected. Zhu Youquan believed that the marriage was blocked midway, and it was difficult for lovers to become married. He thought that the future was hopeless, so he borrowed money from a fellow villager and went to Shanghai to stay at the Oriental Hotel, secretly swallowing poison. Fortunately, Fang, an employee of the hotel, noticed something was wrong and asked him about the cause. He immediately asked a doctor to treat him. Fortunately, the poison was not strong, and his life was not in danger. He immediately sent a letter to his family to rush to Shanghai to pick him up.</p>

<p>Since the Liu Zhuomin case, which implicated Li Shuyun, the wife of Gu Renfa, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, the case of Gu Renfa's bigamy has caused a stir throughout the country and has been closely watched by people from all walks of life. This newspaper has reported on this matter in detail. It is now learned that the Nanjing Control Yuan dispatched personnel to Wuxi a few days ago for a secret investigation. Concrete evidence of Gu Renfa's bigamy has been discovered. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e116">Surveillance Committee Secret Investigation <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>On the 30th, the Nanjing Surveillance Committee sent a member and two secretaries to Wuxi for a secret investigation of the triangular relationship between Gu, Liu, and Li. After arriving in Wuxi, they used aliases and stayed at the Wuxi Hotel, keeping their activities very discreet. Few outsiders were aware of their presence. They purchased multiple copies of newspapers that had been reporting on the case in recent days for reference. They also went to the County Court to review Li Shuyun's statements. They left Wuxi for Zhenjiang that day, made a brief stop, and then returned to Nanjing. Gu Renfa has hired Qin Lianshan and Wang Youling as legal counsel for this case. According to Gu, he will go to Wuxi immediately when the summons from the Wuxi Court arrives at the provincial government. According to news from Nanjing, Gu sent a letter to Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan, a few days ago, detailing the course of the case and requesting punishment. The letter was over a thousand words long.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Gu Confirmed to be Bigamous <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Gu Renfa's marital relationship with his first wife, Ai Chengmei, Gu has claimed publicly that they separated long ago. However, according to reliable sources, Gu and Ai's marital relationship has not been terminated and is still in effect. This is proven by the household registration records of Nanjing City. The records state that at No. 3, Lane 3, No. 12, the following individuals reside: "Head of Household" Gu Renfa, alias Da'an, 43 years old, from Anlu, Hubei Province, moved in on January 30, year 23, currently serving as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy; "Family Members": wife Ai, female, 42 years old, from Anlu County, Hubei Province; son Xinchan, male, 26 years old, studying at Hankou University; son Xinke, male, 8 years old; daughter Kaiti, female, 10 years old, studying at Nanjing Zhonghua Girls' High School; daughter Cixiang, female; female worker Song Wang; male workers Fu Guoliang and Cai Junchen; chauffeur Chen Zifang; Li Sanbao; cook Zhang Zhenxing, etc. Therefore, Gu's bigamy is beyond doubt. However, it is rumored that Gu and Ai have now reached an understanding, so Ai has refused to meet with reporters.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Zhenjiang Lawsuit <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Li Shuyun's lawsuit against Gu for bigamy, it was originally intended to be filed in this county's court. However, after consultation between lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Chao Kun, it was decided that because a lawsuit against Gu for bigamy should legally be filed in the court where the defendant is located, a separate complaint has been drafted and submitted to the Zhenjiang District Court. Most of the evidence of bigamy is being collected from various sources by Li Shuyun's uncle, Li Wenhui. It is also heard that Li Shuyun demanded a divorce after discovering Gu's bigamy. After several negotiations failed to resolve the matter, negotiations broke down before Director Gu went to Jiangxi. To prevent Li from going to the Jiangxi headquarters to file a complaint, Gu sent several people to wait and dissuade her at the ferry terminal, which led to this incident. It is also heard that Director Gu always went to the Nanjing residence on Saturdays after completing his official duties and returned to Zhenjiang on Monday morning.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Continued Interrogation of Shuyun <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 31st) morning at around 9:00 AM, the Wuxi County Court Prosecutor's Office, after receiving the eight pieces of evidence related to the case sent by the Department of Civil Affairs the day before, ordered police officer Qian Chengjun, the chief prosecutor, to bring Gu Renfa, Li Shuyun, Li Liu, and Wen Rongzhen to court for questioning. Li Shuyun was questioned first and denied all eight pieces of evidence. She stated that she was willing to submit handwriting samples if necessary and requested that Gu Renfa be summoned to court for questioning so that the truth could be revealed. She also stated that she would accept legal punishment if there were any instances of selling official positions or titles. Next, Li Liu and Wen Rongzhen were questioned, and they also denied all the evidence and requested that Gu be brought to Wuxi for confrontation. The interrogation ended at around 10:00 AM, and they were all ordered to be returned to custody. It appears that this case will unfold further. The Prosecutor's Office, in order to understand the truth of the case, plans to summon all relevant parties for questioning one by one. Therefore, the day of confrontation between the two sides is not far off. The truth of the case will be revealed after the questioning and confrontation. Yesterday (the 31st), Shuyun's condition improved slightly and there was no major problem. She will soon recover.</p>

<p>Hu Jinlong, the police officer from Yaogang whose case of protecting opium traffickers shocked the entire county, was handed over to Public Security Bureau Chief Fu Qianzhi for custody after being interrogated by the court. Later, Hu was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Criminal Court, but Hu suddenly escaped from the bureau. Local communities, believing that there is a significant cover-up in this case, are requesting that the county and province conduct a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Predictions for the Lantern Festival Competition <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Xieshi lanterns have always been famous for their exquisite artistry, rarely matched elsewhere. In the past, when they were displayed at the Zhang Garden in Shanghai and on the banks of the West Lake in Hangzhou, they were admired by all. In recent years, due to the decline in the market, there have been no such events since the competition in the tenth year of the Republic. This year, various shops hope to revive the declining market with a grand attraction event. Initially, a few people proposed a white-haired lion dance competition, which coincided with the wishes of the shops, leading to a widespread response. The town's plan for a lantern festival competition has been decided by a joint meeting of the five towns, and organizers have been appointed to maintain order. Currently, thirty-five sets of pavilions and towers are under construction. The main lantern festival is expected to take place in late April of the Gregorian calendar. This year, various neighborhoods are exerting their utmost effort and creativity in crafting the lanterns, striving for even greater beauty. It is anticipated that the streets will be ablaze with lights, and the silver light will be dazzling, making it a spectacle to behold. It is also heard that the two railway bureaus have decided to run special trains for three days during the lantern festival. Yesterday, inspectors were sent to Xieshi to discuss locations for tourists to stop and watch.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Sun Ke Issues Statement <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>A Managed Currency Standard is Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>The Situation in North China is Quite Worrying</p>
<p>Changing the Provincial System Will Have to Wait</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, along with Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan, Vice Minister Liu Weichi, Vice Minister of Finance Zou Lin, and others, took the night train to Shanghai the night before last at 11 PM. They arrived at Zhenru at 7:20 AM yesterday morning and went straight to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. A Central News Agency reporter visited Sun at his residence yesterday afternoon and recorded the following statement:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Situation in Eastern Chahar Has Now Eased <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>According to Sun, the situation in eastern Chahar was indeed very tense a few days ago, but it has gradually eased. As for our response measures, they will depend on the actions of the other side. The situation in North China is also quite worrying. Ambassador Yan has just arrived in Shanghai from North China, and you will have learned the details from Ambassador Yan himself.</p>
<h3 id="e127">A Managed Currency Standard is Difficult to Implement <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The issue of our country adopting a managed currency standard has been decided by the National Economic Council and handed over to the Currency System Reform Committee of the Ministry of Finance for research. However, in my observation, it will be quite difficult for our country to adopt a managed currency standard. This is because whether the gold standard is applicable is still a question. If you look at various countries around the world, both the UK and the US have moved from the gold standard to a managed currency standard. Japan is also currently using a managed currency standard. Although France uses the gold standard, the currency circulating within the country is still paper money, and there is very little cash. Therefore, it is equivalent to a managed currency standard. From this, it can be seen that this is the trend of the world. If our country needs to adopt a managed currency standard, it must first have gold reserves and preparation. However, our country currently has no gold reserves or preparation at all. How can we implement a managed currency standard? If we want the Central Bank to issue banknotes to absorb cash, this will also be quite difficult. Therefore, in my observation, the issue of adopting a managed currency standard for our country is difficult to implement at present. But, as the trend of the world, the rise in silver prices will be difficult to avoid in the future. Our country urgently needs to plan for response measures to avoid economic panic in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Discussions on Amending the Criminal Law in April <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to begin discussing the draft amendment to the Criminal Law next month (April). As for the draft constitution, it has now been handed over to the review committee to solicit opinions from all parties and is scheduled to be submitted to the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan for discussion in mid-May. Legislative Committee member Wu Jingxiong, after being persuaded to stay, has now withdrawn his resignation. I have not heard of the rumors that Wu will take up an important position. It is likely not accurate. Minister Luo Wengan has been traveling south for a long time and should be able to return north soon.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Issue of Abolishing Southwest Organs <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of changing the provincial system, it will have to wait until the provincial organization law is amended before it can be implemented. As for the issue of abolishing the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Southwest Executive Department, the central government has not formally discussed it. There may have been exchanges of opinions in private, but I am not aware of the details.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Yan Huiqing's Speech <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Delivered at a Public Banquet Hosted by Three Organizations</p>
<p>Ambassador Yan Huiqing to Russia, is a senior figure in the diplomatic world. His arrival in Shanghai has been warmly welcomed by all sectors. Last night at 7:00 PM, the Shanghai YMCA, the International Problems Research Association, and the China Association for International Culture, jointly hosted a banquet on the ninth floor of the YMCA on Ba Xian Qiao Road. Over three hundred people attended, including Chinese and foreigners, such as Ying Zhongxi, Mu Ouchu, Tang Haian, Yan Deqing, Liu Dajun, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Jingqi, Li Zhaohuan, Lin Wojiang, Chen Liting, Cao Yunxiang, Li Zuchen, Yin Zhiling, Liu Yuwan, Lu Ganchen, Mr. and Mrs. Louis, Lai Huili, Bao Naide, and others. After the meal, Ambassador Yan delivered a speech, and the event concluded with a group photo at around 10:00 PM. Ambassador Yan's speech is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e131">High Cost of Living in Europe and America <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Two years ago, when I was ordered to serve as ambassador, after arriving in various countries in Europe and America, my first impression was the high cost of living there. For example, the luxurious, comfortable, all-steel passenger car I took from San Francisco to Washington was incredibly expensive, far beyond the dreams of the Chinese people. Not long after arriving in Washington, I received a telegram from the government urging me to attend a conference in Europe. The ocean liner from New York to France, with a displacement of 40,000 tons, took only four and a half days to travel that distance. I remember that thirty years ago, when I returned to China from America via Europe, the same distance took more than ten days. The speed of progress is unimaginable. The sophistication of the equipment and the high cost on the ship were also directly proportional. Later, in London, England, and Geneva, Switzerland, I felt the high cost of living everywhere. However, due to the global economic downturn, there were many unemployed people in various countries. It is estimated that there were over ten million in the United States and several million in the UK and Germany. Governments and people alike were feeling the pain and thought it unbearable. Looking back at our country, the number of unemployed people during normal times is probably no less than 50 million. In the past two years, it has probably reached 100 million. Yet, we seem to be indifferent. I have thought about the reason for this, and it is probably because our country's economic organization is far less sophisticated than that of Europe and America. Therefore, we have a sense of numbness. For example, a rickshaw that is not working well can be repaired simply and used勉强. But if a car engine is damaged, it must be carefully repaired in a factory.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Reasons for the Failure of International Conferences <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The international conferences I attended, besides those concerning the Manchurian Incident, were the World Economic Conference and the Disarmament Conference. After returning to China this time, I often heard about the common problem of Chinese meetings, which is that they meet but don't discuss, discuss but don't decide, and decide but don't implement. European international conferences are slightly different. Every meeting discusses, and every decision is implemented. The difficulty lies in discussing but not deciding. The biggest reason for discussing but not deciding is that the participating countries inevitably have selfish intentions. They can't agree with each other and ultimately break down. For example, the World Economic Conference, at that time, people all over the world hoped for its success. On the opening day, the British King personally attended and delivered a speech, and the British Prime Minister served as the chairman. Representatives from various countries gathered together, and the atmosphere was lively and promising. However, everyone had their own agenda and was unwilling to sacrifice. In the end, a major conflict arose due to President Roosevelt's monetary policy, and it ended without much result. Its only achievement was the signing of the International Silver Agreement. After returning to China, I saw many articles about the silver agreement in newspapers and magazines. I am not an expert in finance or economics and dare not make any rash judgments. However, when I attended the Economic Conference with Minister Song at the time, I did give this matter some consideration. My only goal was to stabilize silver prices so that the ratio between gold and silver would not be too disparate. Speaking again of the Disarmament Conference, the reason why it has not been able to achieve results quickly is also because countries are unwilling to sacrifice. For example, naval powers hope to reduce land forces, and land powers hope to eliminate naval forces. Their opinions cannot be reconciled. The reason why they are still continuing to meet is that the people of all countries deeply hate war. If the government cannot敷衍 the public opinion advocating peace, it will be difficult to maintain its position.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Soviet Union's National Austerity and Sacrifice <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>I was in the Soviet Union for only six months. With such a large country, after a superficial observation of six months, I would never dare say that I have any insights. However, we can have different views on the Soviet system, but we cannot deny the government's extraordinary efforts and the people's extraordinary sacrifices. During the outbreak of the European War, I was in Germany. The experiences and feelings I had at that time were almost the same as the experiences and feelings I had in the Soviet Union. In other words, the Soviet Union today is also in a national wartime mobilization era. Individuals cannot keep themselves warm or full, but their spirits are high and they are full of vitality. It is truly "臥薪嘗胆." Their aggressively managed new five-year plan, with the development of heavy industry as its first priority, employs thousands of foreign engineering experts to engage in guidance and design work, aiming to achieve success. This kind of hands-on, austere, and sacrificial spirit is worthy of the people of our country to imitate.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Efforts to Construct and Improve Material Well-being <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>On the way back to China, traveling east through the Suez Canal, I felt the backwardness of material construction in the East and the suffering of the people's livelihood. For example, our country is really too poor, and we should quickly think of ways to improve the material aspects. I often feel that apart from commercial hubs like Shanghai, material construction in our country is at least 150 years behind that of Europe and America. On the one hand, it is because the development of industries requires capital, and without sufficient capital, there is no way to start. On the other hand, it is also because the level of education among the people is too rudimentary. In the Soviet Union, every literate person is legally required to educate five or six other people. With the large number of illiterate people in our country, literate people should redouble their efforts to eliminate illiteracy. After being abroad for two years, I have many feelings about national affairs. The most optimistic thing is that the national government is working hard on construction. The National Economic Council's subsidies for various construction projects are indeed a matter of urgency and should be sincerely supported by the people of our country.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Still Optimistic About the League of Nations <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Finally, I have one more thing I want to say to you. I am still optimistic about the future of the League of Nations. Many Chinese people have expressed their disappointment with the League of Nations because of the Manchurian Incident. However, as I have said before, the League of Nations is not a supreme government. As an organization with a national nature, with the absolute majority of its fifty member states speaking with one voice, advocating justice, saying: "Japan, you are wrong. China, you are right," it is truly an unprecedented event in history. Moreover, the scope of the League of Nations' activities is not limited to international political issues. Recently, it has paid considerable attention to cultural cooperation among countries. The reason why international disputes arise is that countries have not tried to understand each other, and 악감 feelings easily arise. If these feelings become too deep, war will inevitably break out. Therefore, a thorough solution lies in giving countries the opportunity for full cooperation. The importance of cultural cooperation lies here. Newspapers and books have a great influence in promoting this and the League of Nations pays great attention to them. I hope that those of you in the cultural field will promote them to contribute to world peace.</p>

<p>Dr. Rajchman, a technical liaison officer of the League of Nations, has made significant contributions since taking office in China. Because he urgently needs to go to Geneva to report to the League of Nations Administrative Council, he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday to prepare for his departure. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of this city, Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, and the World Society and other groups, hosted a public farewell dinner for Rajchman at the World Society canteen on Ferguson Road last night at 7:00 PM. Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, and others were invited to accompany him. The dinner ended at around 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e138">City Federation of Trade Unions Hosted Morellet Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Morellet Hopes Chinese Workers Will Unite</p>
<p>Mr. Morellet, the Deputy Director of the International Labour Office, came to China to investigate cultural affairs and labour conditions. After arriving in Shanghai on the 16th of last month, he immediately went to Nanjing to exchange views with the Ministry of Education. After completing his business, he returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. The City Federation of Trade Unions hosted him at the YMCA on Ba Xian Qiao Road at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Long Peiyun from the City Federation of Trade Unions, Chen Zongcheng, the head of the Chinese branch of the International Labour Office, and representatives from various trade unions, totaling over sixty people, attended.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>First, the chairman, Zhu Xuefan, stood up to give a speech, stating that today, on behalf of the 400,000 organized workers in Shanghai, the federation is here to welcome Mr. Morellet, the Deputy Director of the International Labour Office, and requested Mr. Morellet to provide guidance on the Chinese workers' movement. He stated the main points of the welcome as follows: (1) The International Labour Organization has made many efforts to improve the lives of workers, which are worthy of our gratitude. (2) The world is facing an extreme economic crisis, and unemployment is serious. Various imperialist powers are also engaged in fierce arms races. Chinese workers are caught in this torrent and urgently need to save themselves. We hope that the International Labour Office will provide assistance. (3) Japan's constant aggression has caused China to suffer even more damage. Chinese workers must strive to make progress and join hands with workers around the world to overcome this difficulty and complete their historical mission to the country and the nation. (4) The urgent demands of Chinese workers today, such as foreign-owned factories in China complying with Chinese laws and Chinese workers residing abroad receiving the same treatment as workers in the host country, and the current implementation of factory inspection rights in Shanghai, are also hoped to be realized. We sincerely hope that Mr. Morellet can provide assistance on the above matters.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Mr. Morellet's Speech <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Next, Mr. Morellet gave a speech. Here are some of the main points: (1) I am very pleased that the chairman said that 400,000 organized workers sympathize with the International Labour Organization. (2) Poverty makes society uneasy and the world chaotic. Therefore, in the future, we should strive to improve the lives of workers. Unemployment is severe today, indeed a famine. There are 300,000 statistically and about 10 million unstatistically. Including their families, there are tens of millions of people. Rescuing the suffering from unemployment is an urgent problem to be solved. The International Labour Office is working on it at all times. (3) Member states of the League of Nations are equal and cannot use imperialism to invade other countries. Although the International Labour Office is not a political organization, it is fundamentally opposed to imperialism. (4) Improving worker education and improving worker treatment are essential. I hope that the workers of your country can unite to help the International Labour Office overcome difficulties. Finally, he expressed his deep gratitude for today's welcome.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Post Office Welcomes <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>A letter from the National Postal Workers' General Union to Mr. Morel reads: Respected Sir, the International Labour Office has been working for the liberation of workers worldwide for more than a decade, with remarkable achievements. All workers deeply admire it. Now, your esteemed Deputy Director has travelled a long distance to our country to inspect the situation of workers, intending to contribute his sincere advice and grand plans to improve the status of Chinese workers. We are deeply grateful. Our union is the general organization of 30,000 postal workers nationwide. In recent years, we have worked tirelessly to protect the treatment of workers, develop postal services, and contribute to the country and society. We have achieved considerable records in the history of the workers' movement. However, the promotion of world peace depends heavily on the unity of international workers. Therefore, in addition to our warm welcome and sincere gratitude, we deeply hope that your esteemed Deputy Director will uphold the spirit of promoting the international workers' movement, not forsake the distance, and provide guidance, so that the happiness of our union members, the unity of international workers, and world peace can be improved day by day, and the welfare of workers will be truly relied upon. Enclosed are several publications of our union for your kind reference. We are deeply grateful. Sincerely, The National Postal Workers' General Union of China, together with Lu Jingshi, Zhu Xuefan, Zhao Shusheng, Zhang Kechang, Wang Xuansheng, Fan Caicong, Shui Xiangyun, and Xu Ziqin, representatives of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, respectfully submit this on March 31st.</p>

<p>Envoy Tuo Shih requested to purchase fine products</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports: There is a very interesting piece of news here, stating that US President Roosevelt is particularly fond of Qimen tribute black tea from China. He serves Qimen tea to guests at home as the finest product. The reason is that Mrs. Roosevelt's grandfather used to work for the American company Lao Qichang in Shanghai. The company dealt with the export of Chinese tea. Therefore, he would send the highest quality black tea home during festivals. President Roosevelt became addicted to it. Before becoming president, he would send people to China to purchase fine products. After becoming president, due to busy schedules, the needs increased. He then personally requested our envoy to the United States, Shih Zhaoji, to purchase fine products on his behalf. Now, Envoy Shih has entrusted the Qimen tribute product, which participated in the Chicago Centennial Exposition, and still requested Envoy Shih to forward it for trial drinking.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Two Railways to Hold System-wide Hygiene Campaign Today <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Three Propaganda Vehicles Specially Arranged</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has scheduled today (April 1st) to hold a system-wide hygiene campaign. The bureau has specially prepared three propaganda vehicles, attached to the rear of passenger trains, to depart and promote the campaign at various stations: (1) Attached to train No. 12 from Shanghai North to Changzhou; (2) Attached to train No. 11 from Nanjing to Changzhou; (3) Attached to train No. 37 from Shanghai North to Zha Kou. The implementation details are as follows: (A) Station Arrangements: 1. Raising flags; 2. Hanging banners and illustrated slogans. (B) Cleaning: 1. General cleaning: All stations, factories, train yards, offices and dormitories, Rotary schools, and trains of the two railways will hold general cleaning. 2. Rectifying tea houses and vendors: The tea houses and vendors at the stations of the two railways, although usually attentive, can further rectify at this time, so that the products, utensils, clothing, and the service providers themselves can be improved, and the concepts and interests of hygiene can be increased significantly. This may yield excellent results in the future. 3. Rectifying dining cars and tea servers: Most of the waiters and tea servers in the dining cars maintain the status quo and lack initiative in hygiene habits. If they are fully rectified at this opportunity, they can be completely reformed. (C) Promotion: 1. Text: Compile and print special issues on hygiene campaigns, as well as illustrations, brochures, leaflets, and slogans on hygiene and prevention of seasonal epidemics, and distribute them to various departments, stations, machine shops, trains, and passengers. 2. Lectures: Give popular lectures to passengers and railway employees. (D) Inspection: The section chiefs of the police sections of the two railways, together with the station masters of each station, will organize inspection teams to go to various stations, vehicles, machine shops, factories, offices, dormitories, and Rotary schools to conduct cleaning inspections and be responsible for maintaining order at the event. (E) Healthcare: 1. Vaccination: The health department will issue a notice to the hospitals and clinics of the two railways to provide vaccination to employees and their families, station passengers, and residents along the railway line. 2.

<p>Postponed Flight to Fujian This Morning</p>
<p>The Jiang Feng seaplane manufactured by the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office was originally scheduled to be flown by instructor Xu Chengqi along the coast to Fuzhou from the water airport on the Longhua River at 8:00 AM yesterday to test the long-distance flight capability of the aircraft. The director of the aircraft office, Zeng Yijing, personally went to the Longhua Airport at 8:00 AM yesterday morning to see instructor Xu off. However, yesterday morning at dawn, heavy fog lingered. Until about 9:00 AM, it still had not dissipated. When instructor Xu drove the plane into the air, he deeply felt the difficulty of identifying the direction. Therefore, he returned to land. The fog completely cleared at 11:00 AM, but it was too late to reach the destination on the same day. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the departure to 7:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Wireless Radio Combination Starts Today <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Colleagues from the Wireless Radio Main Station</p>
<p>Petition to Abolish the Director System</p>
<p>The news of the joint operation of wired and wireless radio has been widely publicized for a long time. The telegram bureau and the wireless radio main station in this city have received an order from the Ministry of Communications to mutually receive and send reports from the receiving and sending offices of both sides from April 1st. In addition, wireless radio stations in various places, except for the economy, are still allowed to be independent, and must be subject to the command and supervision of the local telegraph bureau director. It is heard that all the staff of the wireless radio main station in this city believe that the director system of the telegraph bureau has long been criticized by the world. Now, regardless of qualifications and achievements, making all radio stations in the country subject to the command of the director not only easily leads to disputes, but also enough to make the business worse. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Communications yesterday, requesting the abolition of the director system, and at the time of the joint operation, strict methods should be established and strictly restricted to prevent problems before they occur. The original telegram is recorded below: Minister and Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Communications of Nanjing, Director of the Directorate General of Telecommunications, Your Excellencies, we believe that the joint operation of wired and wireless radio is indeed an important plan to improve telecommunications administration. Now, Your Excellency's telegram orders that from April 1st, wireless radio stations, except for the economy, are still allowed to be independent, and all are under the command and supervision of the wired radio bureau director. We have something to say that we cannot help but say. I would like to elaborate on this to you. The director system of the telegraph bureau has long been criticized by the world. It should be among Your Excellency's insights. Telecommunications is a business nature, and the director is a government official system, which was originally incompatible. In the past, during the warlord era, these directors were mostly appointed by the warlords first, and then the old Ministry of Communications would appoint them again. Under this kind of compromising situation, a situation of separatism was formed, so that the old Ministry of Communications could not intervene in the bureau's affairs and finances. As a result, arbitrary actions were taken, private individuals were employed, and things like cronyism were endless. Even embezzling public funds and absconding were all possible. Today, there are not a few directors who are wanted and at large. The influence of the old telegraph bureau on the world (omitted) is undeniable. Moreover, from the perspective of telecommunications itself, it was originally a group of various technical personnel, and specialized talents should be selected and managed scientifically. Therefore, we changed to the engineer system at the beginning of the establishment of the wireless radio station, so that ambitious warlords could not hijack it, and the uneducated and ignorant could not covet it. The reason why the national radio stations are still energetic and disciplined is by no means accidental. Now, at the beginning of the joint operation, the system is not determined, the organization is not prepared, and a piece of telegram orders all radio stations in the country to be subject to the command and supervision of the directors of various bureaus. Regardless of whether the qualifications and experience of the directors of various places are above the engineers of each station, it is still questionable. Moreover, there have been many disputes between bureaus and stations due to business relations in the past, and it is not difficult to review them. Now, regardless of qualifications and achievements, forcibly ordering them to be subject to their command, then on the one hand, in addition to being complacent and arrogant, arbitrarily arranging things is in their mind. It is inevitable that conflicts will occur and business will be ruined. Why should you say it again? Is this not the original intention of Your Excellency's joint operation? Therefore, the director system must be abolished in the future. For the current transition, it is especially necessary to establish strict methods and strictly restrict them, so that the power of command is still unified in the department and division, so as to prevent problems before they occur. Moreover, the directors currently appointed by Your Excellency are honest, self-loving, and specialized talents, then at the time of the joint operation, they can be separately changed and checked into technical reporting personnel. In the future, select the best to be appointed to the position of主管电信机关, and for the sake of thoroughly reforming telecommunications administration, it seems appropriate to stipulate that special-grade and first-grade agencies should set up chief engineers as the统辖 personnel, and those of the second and third grades and below should set up directors, who should be selected and promoted from technical reporting personnel or business personnel with matching qualifications. If so, the telecommunications agency will be entirely governed by specialized talents, and the business prospects will be promising. The views of our 等 are humble and there are many errors, but out of the enthusiasm for protecting telecommunications administration, we venture to state them. We respectfully ask you to review, decide, and implement them. Telecommunications is fortunate, and we 等 are fortunate. Staff of the Shanghai Wireless Radio Main Station respectfully bow,世,</p>
<h3 id="e152">Railway Bureau Ordered to Deal with Wusong Factory Strike Case <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Ten Directors Arrested</p>
<p>Factory Director of the Machine Factory Changed</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration issued a message saying that in December of last year, when the central government was suppressing the Fujian rebellion and martial law was in effect in Shanghai, the Wusong Machine Factory branch of the railway trade union accused Mo Heng, director of the General Affairs Department and the Materials Department. At the same time, the workers of the machine factory and the Wusong Materials Factory suddenly went on strike. The Ministry of Railways has instructed to handle it according to law. The bureau has separately notified the special party department and the trade union of the railway, and at the same time announced it to the public. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e153">Cause of the Case <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>In December of last year, Mo Heng, director of the General Affairs Department and the Materials Department of the Railway Bureau, transferred Cao Wenkui, an employee of the Wusong Materials Department, to Ningbo to serve. Cao also served as the director of the branch office of the two railway trade unions. The trade union members believed that Director Mo's move was to divide the power of the trade union and intentionally undermine the workers' movement. They accused Director Mo of undermining the workers' movement, slandering the party department for engaging in private corruption, and other charges to the railway bureau and the Ministry of Railways, and went on strike to force Director Mo to be expelled. The Railway Bureau consulted with the two railway party departments to give good guidance, and submitted a request to the ministry for instructions on how to handle it. The ministry sent personnel to the railway to thoroughly investigate and advised them to resume work. Soon, the workers also followed the advice and resumed work first, waiting for the ministry to deal with it.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Ministry Ordered to Handle <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>After thoroughly investigating the truth and studying it in detail, the Ministry of Railways instructed the Railway Bureau to handle it in three points: (1) There is no evidence to support the original accusations, and they should be dismissed without discussion. (2) Director Mo's imprudent remarks caused misunderstandings and should be reprimanded. (3) The workers of the department did not wait for a legal resolution and went on strike to force them to comply. Cao Wenkui has not yet complied with the transfer to Ningbo, which is inappropriate and should be dealt with according to law. The bureau should follow Article 30 of the Railway Employee Service Regulations, which states, "Employees who take the opportunity to gather crowds for strikes or delays, or gather crowds to force compliance and disrupt order, shall be dismissed and prosecuted by the court according to their leaders and followers. During military martial law, they may also be punished according to military law." After reporting to the Ministry of Railways, they were ordered by the Ministry of Railways to inform them by telegram on a specific date. It has been forwarded to the Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who replied with two points: (1) Cao Wenkui should be punished by the Shanghai Garrison Command to the fullest extent of the law. (2) If the Wusong Machine Factory attempts to strike again, the Shanghai Security Team will be dispatched by the Shanghai Garrison Command to strictly suppress it. The bureau has followed the order on March 30 and separately notified the special party department and the trade union of the railway. The Shanghai Garrison Command has also dispatched the Shanghai Security Team to be stationed in Wusong to protect the machine factory and its employees. Although the workers of the machine factory and the Wusong Materials Factory who echoed the strike should be dismissed according to law, they are treated leniently.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Railway Bureau Announcement <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration announced that in December of last year, the workers of the Wusong Machine Factory and the Wusong Materials Factory went on strike for as long as a week, causing huge losses to the railway, and also incited other workers to respond. At that time, the central government was suppressing the Fujian rebellion and martial law was in effect in Shanghai. The military transportation of the two railways was very important. It was reported that there were reactionary elements manipulating them, trying to undermine the overall situation. The Ministry of Railways has instructed that this strike should be handled according to law. In addition to transferring the employees who instigated the strike on that day to the Shanghai Garrison Command for investigation and punishment according to the order of the Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in accordance with Article 30 of the Railway Employee Service Regulations, all workers of the two railways who participated in the strike should also be dismissed and prosecuted in accordance with Article 30 of the Railway Employee Service Regulations. They are treated leniently because of their ignorance and being deceived. The Machine Department and the Materials Department have been ordered to admonish them earnestly. They should continue to work normally with peace of mind and sincerity, and do not need to be suspicious and afraid. But if they do not cherish themselves and are incited by others, and have excessive actions, they will only be reported to the Shanghai Garrison Command and severely suppressed in accordance with the order of the Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Other workers who were not incited and did not participate in the strike at that time are not related to this case. They should uphold the original intention of loving the railway and the country, abide by discipline, and work seriously. This is very important. This announcement.</p>

<p>The New Sound News Agency reported that the two railway trade unions telegraphed the two railway special party departments, stating that according to reports, at about 10:00 AM today, Wang, the director of the Machine Department of the Two Railway Administration, notified all directors of the Wusong Machine Factory branch of the trade union to go to the meeting room in the North Station for talks. However, when the directors arrived at the North Station, they were taken to the Shanghai Garrison Command by armed railway police. Except for directors Zhu Derong and Tang Dafa, who were sick and did not arrive, the other directors, Cao Wenkui, Han Weiyu, Li Kuiyuan, Chen Shusheng, Shi Zhenyuan, Tang Genfa, He Laixing, Lin Jinlin, Xu Shanqing, and Zhou Weixian, ten people in total, were all arrested and have not been released yet, and the facts are unclear and the reasons are unknown.

<p>Has Met with Leaders of the Industrial and Commercial Circles</p>
<p>Another Farce of National Diplomacy</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reported that recently the Japanese government has changed its strategy towards China, hoping to use soft methods to ease the air of rejecting Japanese goods. Therefore, another farce of national diplomacy for Sino-Japanese friendship has appeared. According to the investigation of the New Sound News Agency, Sogawa, the managing director of the South Manchuria Railway, has been in Shanghai for nearly a week and is the initiator of this farce. He is currently residing in a certain Japanese hotel in Hongkou and has met with a part of the industrial and commercial leaders of this city twice to exchange opinions. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency asked Mr. Yu Qiaqing of the shipping industry about this matter. According to him, someone has indeed been running around for this matter recently, but I believe that if Japan cannot have a clear expression on the issue of the three northeastern provinces, then all issues cannot be discussed.</p>

<p>To All Factories:</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Association sent a letter yesterday to various factories, inviting them to participate in the National Products Exhibition in Nanjing. The letter stated: "We hereby inform you that we previously received a letter from the National Products Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry, stating that a spring National Products Exhibition would be held on April 20th of this year, and requesting our assistance in collecting exhibits, etc. We have already notified you. On March 28th, Director Peng of the National Products Exhibition Hall came to our association to discuss and decide that our association would still lead Shanghai National Products manufacturers to participate. However, fearing that the time is too short and the manufacturers may not be able to prepare in time, it was agreed to request the Ministry of Industry to change the opening date to May 1st and to separate the existing National Products Market to show the distinction. All exhibits for the exhibition will still be given railway freight reduction vouchers in accordance with regulations, and freight will be reduced by half. Business tax and advertising tax within the venue will be completely waived. Factories affiliated with our association are urged to actively participate in the practical work of the national products movement. We hereby send you the agreed-upon methods for your information and request that your factory register with our association by the deadline to jointly participate in this grand event. We cannot express our eagerness. Sincerely, to all member factories. Details are as follows: Exhibition period: three weeks; Opening: May 1st; Venue: National Products Exhibition Hall, Huaiqing Bridge; Venue fee: 35 yuan per booth; Registration deadline: April 24th; Transportation: Lixing Transportation Company, 'North Station' for receiving goods, deadline April 26th. 'Please have participating manufacturers send the goods directly to the Lixing venue for delivery.' Participating manufacturer representatives traveling to Beijing: assemble at 8:00 AM on April 28th at the North Station to take the train to Beijing."</p>

<p>A New Atmosphere for Promoting National Products</p>
<p>Ren Jinping Expresses Opinions</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the China National Products Production and Sales United Company has followed the wishes of the Beijing Municipal Government and decided at its first board meeting to make the establishment of a Nanjing National Products Company its first task. It specifically dispatched Ren Jinping, Secretary-General of the company's board of directors and supervisors, to Beijing to request the guidance of the Municipal Government and begin the process, as previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Wu Jingxiu, President of the Bank of China in Nanjing, and others also met in Beijing at the World Hotel a few days ago to discuss the subsequent establishment of a National Products Company. It is said that its scope is larger than the Nanjing National Products Company being prepared under the leadership of the Municipal Government. Reporters stationed in Beijing visited Ren Jinping at the Municipal Government Preparatory Office yesterday to inquire about his opinion on this matter. Mr. Ren said that from the standpoint of the Production and Sales Company, he extremely welcomed Mr. Wu and Mr. Pan's subsequent establishment of a National Products Company. Even considering the wishes of the Municipal Government, he would certainly be optimistic about the increase in National Products Companies in Beijing. The plan adopted by the Production and Sales Company aims to develop a sales network, hoping for the rise of a large number of National Products Companies and National Products chain stores to transform the commercial organization that promotes foreign goods. The National Products Company being prepared by Mr. Wu and others, as far as he knew, belongs to the scope of the Production and Sales Cooperation Association. After the Production and Sales Cooperation Association was initiated, its Director-General, Mr. Du Chongyuan, with an attitude of humility, asked Mr. Huang Renzhi to obtain a plan for building a National Products business from him. Now, the method established by the Joint Office jointly run by the Association and the National Products Introduction for establishing National Products Companies in various places is consistent with the third section of the fourth chapter of his plan. Not only is there absolutely no conflict, but it can also achieve the same effect through different routes in promoting National Products.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News stated: "In this era of declining industries, magazine operators are also suffering significant blows due to exchange rate issues. Not only are housewives and professional women trying to save money, but companies and stores are also reducing their scope and reorganizing, leading to a sharp decline in the purchasing power of popular magazines. On the other hand, the Chinese intellectual class has recently developed a passion for studying Japan, leading to a sharp increase in sales of Japanese economic magazines and other specialized scientific magazines. Can this terrifying Chinese enthusiasm for studying Japan be considered a superficial phenomenon?"</p>
<h3 id="e167">Lawyer Yan Luqing Accused of Insulting the Court <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Many Disputes in the Huang Chujiu Estate Case</p>
<p>Lawyer Yan Loudly Reads the Judge is a Living Buddha</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court, due to the issue of auctioning off real estate mortgaged to the Wanchun Silver Group and the China Industrial Bank in the Huang Chujiu estate debt case, summoned lawyers representing various creditors and debtors to court on February 23rd, presided over by Judge Cao Jun of the Enforcement Chamber, for a hearing. The court intended to have a portion of Huang's mortgaged property valued and handed over to the mortgagees. Consequently, a portion of ordinary creditors...</p>
<p>...the draft report submitted by his client contained a passage saying, "The judge is like a living Buddha, and the mortgage creditors have reached a settlement with the president of the court to receive the proceeds from the auction," etc. The court, considering Lawyer Yan Luqing's actions to be obstructing official duties and intentionally insulting the court, transferred the case to the Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor Wang Ren summoned Lawyer Yan Luqing to court for investigation. As a result, he believed that Yan was indeed suspected of insult and filed a public prosecution with the same-level court in accordance with Article 146 of the Criminal Law. The court issued a summons, and Yan appeared in court yesterday. At 10:00 AM, Judge Sun Pengxian, together with Prosecutor Wang Ren and Clerk Chen Boyan, specially opened the Sixth Court for trial. In court, the judge first inquired about the defendant's age and origin. Then, the prosecutor stood up and stated the intention of the prosecution. The judge asked Yan Luqing, "On February 23rd, during the court session for the late Huang Chujiu's estate debt case, did you loudly read the draft report when the enforcement judge was presiding over the hearing? When the enforcement judge told you not to read it, did you ignore him and continue reading?" Yan replied, "That's not right. There were special circumstances. Firstly, this request in the report was urgently related to the case. Secondly, the court had not yet received this report. Thirdly, the original handwriting of the draft was unclear, so I was afraid the judge couldn't see it clearly. Therefore, I asked the judge to issue the draft for me to read." The judge asked, "Does the report contain a passage saying, 'The judge is a living Buddha, no different from a puppet,' and 'The Wanchun Silver Group and the China Industrial Bank have reached a settlement with the president of the court,' etc.? Was it intentional insult?" Yan replied, "The client sent this draft to my office a few days ago. However, my request was entirely for the purpose of not issuing funds to the Wanchun Silver Group. When reading the draft, I inadvertently read this passage. It was due to the circumstances and not intentional insult." The judge asked, "Did Judge Cao prohibit you from reading the draft when you were reading it?" Yan replied, "No." The judge said that there was a clerk's record as evidence today. Yan replied, "Although there is this statement, I did not read this record at the time and did not sign it." The judge asked, "When you were reading the draft, did you feel that you were insulting the court?" Yan replied, "I didn't think of it at the time. Only now do I realize that it was slightly inappropriate." However, the defendant has always respected the court, has no personal or public animosity, and has no conflict of interest. How could I have the intention to insult? After questioning, the judge ordered the debate to begin. Prosecutor Wang stood up to argue, stating that the defendant in this case, in court, loudly read that Judge Cao was a living Buddha, no different from a puppet, and that the Wanchun Silver Group and the China Industrial Bank had reached a settlement with the president of the court, etc., which was indeed an insult and should be judged in accordance with Article 146 of the Criminal Law. The defendant, Yan Luqing, did not retain a lawyer and defended himself, stating that he read it because the handwriting of the draft report was not clear when the enforcement chamber was in session. The clerk's record of Judge Cao saying that I read it loudly is not accurate. Please note that the defendant usually detests rumors. This time, the client came to me and mentioned this rumor. I immediately tried to refute its absurdity. As for reading the entire report in court, it cannot be discussed as a rumor. Moreover, reading the report is a legitimate act. If the court cannot read the statement of claim, then where can it be read? To be prosecuted and deemed a criminal for a lawyer reading a statement of claim is unexpected. If the judge believed that there was something illegal in reading the statement of claim at the time, he could have prohibited it. However, the defendant started handling this case with great enthusiasm, solely and wholeheartedly to safeguard the rights and property of the client from danger. Therefore, I requested that this statement be issued for me to read, and I inadvertently read the passage about the judge and the president. I never expected to be a defendant today. Moreover, Article 1 of the Criminal Law states that an act is not a crime if there is no explicit penalty in the law at the time of the act. Article 24 states that non-intentional acts are not punishable. Article 34 states that acts performed in accordance with the law or legitimate acts in the course of legitimate business are not punishable. Article 36 states that acts of defense against present unlawful infringement of one's own or another's rights are not punishable. Article 37 states that acts of necessity in order to rescue oneself or another from imminent danger to life, body, freedom, or property are not punishable. I request that the court reject the public prosecution and declare the defendant not guilty, etc. After the debate, the court announced the end of the debate and adjourned the hearing to a scheduled sentencing.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Landlord Fails in Attempt to Increase Rent at Shoupin Lane <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>No Reason for Rent Increase</p>
<p>Plaintiff Loses Lawsuit Yesterday</p>
<p>The houses in Shoupin Lane on Huade Road in Yangshupu originally belonged to the Yipin Bank. The rent was increased once in March of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930). At that time, the tenants and the owner signed a contract stating that the rent could only be increased or decreased after the end of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), and only with the consent of both parties. Later, Yipin sold the property to others. The new owner commissioned the Gao Yi Real Estate Agency to manage the property. In November of last year, the agency notified all tenants of a rent increase. The rent for each market house, originally 22 yuan, would be increased by 29 yuan, requiring a monthly payment of 51 yuan. The rent for each lane house, originally 18 yuan, would be increased by 13 yuan, requiring a monthly payment of 31 yuan. The rent for double houses, originally 40 yuan, would be increased by 33 yuan, requiring a monthly payment of 73 yuan. The tenants, citing the previous contract, stated that the period for increasing or decreasing the rent had not yet arrived. Moreover, with the economic downturn in recent years, citizens were requesting rent reductions to ease their burden. The owner, on the contrary, wanted to violate the contract and increase the rent at this time, which was purely self-serving. After a meeting of all the tenants, they specially hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to negotiate with the Gao Yi Real Estate Agency, demanding that they respect the previous agreement, consider the people's livelihood, and cancel the rent increase proposal. Negotiations broke down last month. Gao Yi Real Estate Agency then filed a lawsuit against all the tenants in the First Special District Court, requesting that the court order the tenants to move out and return the houses. During the court hearing, lawyer Yuan, representing the tenants, argued based on the contract, rental customs, and the fact that the landlord could not force the tenants to move out if they did not owe more than three months' rent. He debated with the plaintiff's lawyer, Lu Xingyuan, requesting that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected. The presiding judge, Qiao Wanxuan, has now announced the judgment, stating that the plaintiff's claims are groundless and should be dismissed, and the plaintiff should bear the litigation costs.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Zhou E'xuan Sued for Confirmation of Biological Son <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Jurisdiction Error, Transferred to Local Court for Trial</p>
<p>Zhou E'xuan, the eldest son of Zhou Weishi, owner of the Zhou Gengji Yarn Store, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou living in Shanghai, was sued by Zhang Zhuying, the mother of his biological son, Dayuan, in the name of the child's legal guardian, for abandoning Dayuan and failing to provide support. She hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Zhou E'xuan, requesting that the defendant be punished in accordance with Article 309 of the Criminal Law. After repeated summons by the First Special District Court, the defendant flatly denied it. The court then sent the plaintiff, defendant, and the boy Dayuan to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute for identification. The results confirmed that Dayuan was indeed the biological son of Zhou E'xuan and Zhang Zhuying, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Xiangzu held a continued hearing. The defendant's lawyer first stated the reason for requesting a stay of proceedings, saying in brief that if the defendant and the child did have a filial relationship, then a self-accusation would not be legally possible. However, the defendant has always denied that the child was born to him, so the point of contention in this case is actually the question of recognition or denial. This question should be resolved by the civil court. The defendant has now submitted a petition for mediation, requesting mediation. It is expected that the mediation will not be successful and a lawsuit to deny the relationship will have to be filed. In order to comply with the procedure, the personal lawsuit should be resolved first, and then the criminal case. Therefore, he requested that the case be stayed. The plaintiff's lawyer stood up to object, saying that the defendant's request was too late, as the case had now entered the trial phase. The request made by the defendant should have been made during the investigation. Judge Wu then questioned Zhou E'xuan, who stated that the mediation petition was sent to the court on the 26th. The judge then declared that according to the law, a personal lawsuit that has not been formally filed cannot be used to request a stay of proceedings in another case. However, if the defendant in this case constitutes a crime, then the crime committed should be a violation of Article 310, which should be handled by the local court. He immediately wrote the judgment: "This case is a jurisdiction error and should be transferred to the local court for handling." Defendant Zhou E'xuan paid 20,000 yuan in cash as bail.</p>

<p>Sun Zhesheng, President of the Legislative Yuan, greatly appreciates the Shanghai YMCA's engagement in social enterprises for the well-being of Chinese youth. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, he specially hosted a tea party at the Hua An Building on Jing'an Temple Road to entertain YMCA team leaders and committee members. Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Xu Shiying, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Wojiang, Wu Yunzhai, Luo Weilian (transliteration), Tang Haian, Lu Ganchen, and dozens of others attended. The responses of the guests and host are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e172">Mr. Sun's Speech <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The tea party began. After the guests were seated, President Sun stood up to speak, saying in essence that today he was taking this opportunity to host a tea party to entertain the team leaders and committee members of the YMCA recruitment team. This is an obligation to the YMCA, and your efforts in recruitment are also an obligation. Comparing the two, your obligation is heavier. The fundraising for the 60,000 yuan subsidy this year, according to the first three reports, has been very successful and has reached two-thirds of the goal. In the remaining ten days of this final recruitment, although it may not be possible to reach the goal as desired, at a minimum, it can be increased by 20,000 yuan to reach 60,000 yuan. If everyone works as hard as they are today, it is not impossible to exceed the goal. As for the organization of the YMCA, it is religious on the one hand and social on the other. Such organizations are better in European and American countries than in our country. Recruiting members is not limited to religious beliefs but also serves to attract Chinese youth to the right path. Therefore, your recruitment, in a narrow sense, is an effort for the YMCA, and in a broad sense, it is an effort for the future of Chinese youth.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Mr. Wu's Response <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The response was then given by Chief Captain and Mayor Wu Tiecheng, who said in brief, "I was elected as the chief captain of the YMCA recruitment convention this time. Today, I am honored by the team leaders and committee members, and I express my gratitude to President Sun for today's tea party. At the same time, the YMCA recruitment convention has received the promotion of President Sun, and the recruitment results are as intended. President Sun said that the YMCA is a social enterprise, which is true. Social enterprises are both passive and active. Generally, people only care about the present and engage in passive social enterprises, without considering the future. For example, recently, philanthropists in Shanghai initiated the Anti-Tuberculosis Association. It is too late to treat tuberculosis when one has it. Preventing it before getting sick is active. The YMCA's engagement in social enterprises has a long history. It is not for the present but for the future. Even this kind of work is being done undercover, in the social underbelly, and it is not easy to see. As President Sun said above, everyone should adhere to this purpose and work even harder." Finally, Mr. Lu Ganchen, on behalf of the YMCA, expressed his gratitude to President Sun for the tea party. The party ended at 5:30 PM.</p>

<p>Effective Today</p>
<p>The Inspector General of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, Mr. Mayers, previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for interpretation regarding whether the towing barge regulations apply to foreign towing barges and whether a reasonable period should be granted for implementation. The Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the Ministry of Communications. It is now learned that the Ministry of Communications, after considering the situation, has explained that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was consulted on the issue of whether or not to issue licenses to foreign towing barges. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that issuing licenses does not conflict with current treaties. Contact was also made with the Ministry of Finance, which stated that the Customs had stopped issuing towing barge licenses since the implementation of the Towing Barge Management Regulations on November 1st of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Since issuing licenses to foreign towing barges does not conflict with treaties and the Customs has stopped issuing licenses, all the regulations stipulated in the Towing Barge Management Regulations issued by the Ministry of Communications should apply to foreign towing barges. All instructions in the Ministry's No. 6407 order last year, "However, foreign vessels do not need to apply for towing barge licenses," should be canceled. The period for the Customs to implement control over foreign towing barges should be extended to April 1st of this year.</p>

First, the chairman reported that the association's ninth general membership drive was decided to be held on April 15th at a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on March 15th.

In addition, the organization of each team and the various ceremonies for the opening day and the unveiling date should also be resolved. Decisions: (1) The team names may use the titles of the respective team leaders, but the teams will still be grouped by industry. (2) The opening date will be changed to May 2nd. Western food will be prepared on that day, and a domestic film will be shown to add to the fun. (3) The closing date is scheduled for June 2nd.

<p>New Appointee Lancaster</p>
<p>Mr. F.A. Harris, the British accounting director of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, has retired and returned to his home country. His position has been succeeded by Mr. W.O. Lancaster, also British. Mr. Lancaster officially assumed his duties on the 26th of last month. Previously, Mr. Lancaster served as an auditor for the former Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau, eventually rising to the position of Chief of Accounts (equivalent to the current accounting director). He has over ten years of experience and is exceptionally familiar with the situation of both railways. The Director of the Railway Bureau, Huang Boqiao, and the Deputy Director, Wu Shaozeng, hosted Mr. Lancaster at the New Asia Hotel yesterday (March 31st) at noon to express their welcome and to bid farewell to the outgoing director, Mr. Harris, expressing their regret at his departure. At the same time, they introduced the bureau's newly appointed secretary, Mr. Liu Dingxin. Mr. Liu was originally a professor at Peiping Jiaotong University and has extensive research in transportation and other subjects. He has translated the book "Transportation Studies." The Ministry of Railways appointed Mr. Liu to succeed Mr. Xiao Weiguo, the former secretary of the bureau, who has been promoted to Chief of the Transportation Department.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Business Offices of Both Railways Reduce Luggage Handling Fees <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>A Flat Rate of Twenty-Five Cents Per Piece</p>
<p>The business offices of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have been operating very successfully. In particular, the freight business has been most developed, which is convenient to the society and leads to sharp increases in business income. Recently, luggage handling fees have been reduced, and direct issuance of parcel receipts has been implemented, which is very optimistic for the business development. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Monthly Operating Revenue Exceeds 40,000 Yuan. Since its opening, the operating revenue of the office has been increasing monthly. The monthly income for January and February of this year both exceeded 40,000 yuan. The income for this month is expected to be even more considerable, with an average daily business of about 1,400 yuan. Both the Beijing office and the Nanshi branch office have also made progress.</p>
<p>Significant Reduction in Luggage Handling Fees. The original rate for the office to pick up and deliver luggage for customers was 40 cents per piece, 35 cents per piece for 10 to 19 pieces, 30 cents per piece for 20 to 29 pieces, and 25 cents per piece for 30 pieces or more. Now, the office considers that most ordinary passengers have fewer than 10 pieces of luggage, and charging 40 cents per piece may be slightly high. Therefore, it has been approved that the rate will be reduced to 25 cents per piece starting from April 1st. There is no separate loading and unloading fee at the North Station.</p>
<p>Parcel Receipts Can Be Obtained Immediately. The parcel business of the office is growing daily. In the past, customers had to send parcels to the office, which then had to be transferred to the North Station to issue official receipts and send them to customers. The procedures were complicated and prone to delays. It has now been decided to install scales in the office, so that customers can obtain receipts immediately after sending parcels to the office, which is very convenient. This new plan is currently being prepared and will be implemented soon.</p>

<p>Glycerin is a kind of national defense industry, and has a wide range of uses. Our country's annual imports reach as much as 2 million yuan. The Wuzhou Pharmacy is thinking of making up this leakage, and specially set up a factory in the city's Xi'anhe Temple Road to produce domestic glycerin. The product has been tested by experts, who believe that the results are excellent, and is suitable for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, educational products, antifreeze products, and so on. According to reporters' investigation, since the company's domestic glycerin was released, orders from various parties have been very enthusiastic, such as major chemical industrial companies, major tobacco companies, major industrial companies, major paint factories, and so on, all have large numbers of orders. And the company's retail department in a month, there are also more than ten tons sold.</p>

<h3 id="e187">The Abbot of Jing'an Temple is Well-Chosen <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Jing'an Temple in western Shanghai is one of the ancient temples in the city. As the abbot of the tonsure faction, the former abbot Zhiwen's master had a loyal nature, so he ceded the abbacy to his disciple Zhiwen, causing Zhiwen's fellow disciple Zhifa to be dissatisfied and repeatedly start disputes, leading to years of lawsuits and piles of files. It is unknown how much of the temple property has been sold, mortgaged, or rented out, because the area is prosperous and land prices have risen sharply, and there are countless people trying to profit from it. According to the local gentry, Jing'an Temple has a total of 102 mu of land around it. After deducting about 30 mu for opening roads, there are still about 70 mu. How much of it remains to this day is unknown. However, few people have bought this temple property. Now, the municipal government of this city has decided to expel the tonsure faction in order to thoroughly clarify the situation and has elected Master Yuanying as the abbot of the temple through the Shanghai Buddhist Association. From now on, all the land of the temple will no longer be stolen and sold by these inferior monks.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Rent Reduction Implemented in Hengxing Lane, Shiliupu <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Hengxing Lane, east and west of Shiliupu, was originally the property of Heng Yufeng Industry, which was later transferred to the Bank of Communications of China. It is now heard that the rent reduction issue in the lane has come to an end. The following is a copy of the letter from the East and West Hengxing Lane Branch of the Nanshi District Rent Reduction Association to each tenant: Dear Tenants, The houses in this lane were built before the January 28th Incident. Since the January 28th Incident, the original rent has been calculated at 83%. Recently, due to the sluggish market and difficult livelihoods, the tenants in this lane have requested rent reductions from the landlord, but without results. They had no choice but to petition the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee to establish the East and West Hengxing Lane Branch, elect committee members, and handle rent reduction matters. Through the unity of all tenants and the efforts of the committee members, and the representatives Wang Wenbang, Cheng Minghao, Chen Jiakun, Chen Yaoting, Hu Dexiang, and Ye Songmao, who spared no effort in running around and negotiating, the goal of implementing rent reduction was finally achieved. The landlord has understood and appointed representative Fan Hengde to negotiate peaceful solutions with the lane representatives. Finally, it was decided that starting from February of this year, the current rent will be calculated at 90%. Both parties have reached a compromise. The original rent for the houses in this lane was 83% after the war, and now it is 90%, which is not much different from the rent reduction methods decided by the city-wide rent reduction meeting. This notice is to inform all tenants to abide by the resolution and pay the rent as usual. Yours sincerely, to your honorable tenant.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Ministry of Finance Orders Import Tax on Coal Oil and Gasoline to be Increased Starting Today <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Customs Announces Tax Rate Notice to Begin Collection</p>
<p>Annual Increase of 10 Million Possible After Tax Increase</p>
<p>Coal oil and gasoline are not produced in our country, but they are necessary for the people of a boat and for industrial use. Japan and our country are in a similar situation, and the government taxes are particularly light to reduce the burden on the people. Because our country's finances are not on track and expenditures are in short supply, there is no other way but to increase taxes to make up for the shortfall. After a long period of careful consideration, the government has determined a new tax rate and will first try it out. The reporter of Shenshi News Agency specially investigated and recorded the various situations as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e192">Ministry of Finance Orders Commencement <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi has always adhered to the policy of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, and rectifying national tax revenue in order to stabilize finances and put them on track. The annual import volume of coal oil and gasoline is very large, and a slight increase in the tax rate can increase the annual revenue by 10 million yuan, which is indeed a shortcut to increasing revenue. The tax increase has been under consideration for a long time in order to increase revenue, but it was slightly frustrated by opposition from the Legislative Yuan and other parties. It has now been realized. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance secretly ordered the Jianghai Customs Superintendent and the Chief Tax Officer five days ago to issue a notice that, starting from April 1, the amended coal oil, gasoline, and type B diesel tax rates determined by the Ministry of Finance will be temporarily implemented according to the new rules. Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tang Haian and Customs Tax Officer Bolede issued notices in Chinese and foreign newspapers today to implement the order.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Customs Issues Notice to Commence Collection <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs has issued a notice to temporarily implement the amended coal oil, gasoline, and type B diesel tax rates, and today issued Notice No. 1351, which was sent to Chinese and foreign newspapers for publication. The reporter of Shenshi News Agency has found and recorded the notice as follows: Jianghai Customs issues Notice No. 1351 to temporarily implement the amended coal oil, gasoline, and type B diesel tax rates. Now, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, starting from April 1 of this year, the amended import tariff rates for coal oil and diesel will be temporarily implemented as follows: No. 520 Mineral, gasoline, naphthenic gasoline, and aromatic gasoline (including various unspecified engine fuels) (A) Boxed, two cans per box, each can 18.93 liters, or 5 US gallons, 2.10 gold units, (B) Bulk, 10 liters, 0.53 gold units, No. 532 Kerosene, (including other mineral oils for ignition with a specific gravity of 0.78 to 0.90) (A) Boxed, two cans per box, each can 18.93 kilograms, or 5 US gallons, 1.80 gold units, (B) Bulk, 10 liters 0.45 gold units, No. 529 Diesel, (B) Other (including crude oil for refining) 33.60 gold units per tonne, (Note) For diesel imports with a kerosene content of more than 60%, the principle of proportionate taxation applies. The customs will verify the actual kerosene content and levy diesel tax at a rate of 33.60 gold units per tonne for 60% kerosene content, but limited to 80% kerosene content. Also, for kerosene refined in Guangdong and Guangxi and transported to other provinces, in addition to the transit tax and surtax, the import tax should also be supplemented. The tax rates are as follows: No. 532 Kerosene, (A) Boxed, two cans per box, each can 18.93 liters, or 5 US gallons, 1.55 gold units (B) Bulk, 10 liters, 0.41 gold units. All merchants should be aware of this and are hereby notified. March 31, 23rd year of the Republic of China, Superintendent Tang Haian, Tax Officer Bolede.</p>

<p>The import volume of coal oil and gasoline is very large, which is a big leak. According to reporters, the import value for each year is as follows: 64.779 thousand taels in the 18th year, 65.043 thousand taels in the 19th year, 79.757 thousand taels in the 20th year, 56.954.554 gold units in the 21st year, 52.918.149 gold units in the 22nd year, and 58.432180 gold units in the 23rd year.</p>

<p>Village, Wuzhou Road. Her husband, Yan Bingzhi, used to work on a ship, but is now unemployed at home. She used to work as a servant for others, and the wages she earned were used to maintain the couple's life, which was barely enough to eat. Unexpectedly, a month ago, she was dismissed by her employer for some reason. After returning home, the couple sat守家門, and the economy became more difficult. Because she thought that the days were still long, and how could she live them, she resented it after thinking about it the day before yesterday, and then萌生厭世 and committed suicide by secretly swallowing opium. After her husband found out, he sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she died soon. The hospital reported to the Jiaxing Road Police Station and ordered Detective Qi Fanglian to go to investigate, and then transferred the body to the Fei Lun Road coroner's office. Yesterday morning, Zhang Junqing, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, came to the office to examine the body, and asked the corpse husband Yan Bingsan to report the previous situation. Zhang Jun then announced that the deceased Yan Wang was a woman and had died from opium poisoning during her lifetime. The corpse was handed over to her husband Yan Bingzhi to be claimed back and coffined.</p>

When he was informed, his father did not recognize his son and did not want to claim the body. Yesterday morning, Zhang Junqing, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, came to the morgue to examine the corpse. He asked Wang Eryuan, a native of Hangzhou, 20 years old, who had lived with the deceased for about a month since they met one month ago. She stated that because he was broke, he committed suicide. Detective Liu Longchao also reported the results of the investigation. Zhang ruled that Ma Anwei, a man, died by poisoning himself. He ordered that the body be handed over to the Pushan Villa for collection.</p>

<p>The Crisis of the Yale Lock: A household with a Yale lock in Yideli Lane, Caishi Street, in the French Concession, was broken into through the lock last night. The thief opened the lock from the outside with a key and stole five or six hundred gold coins. Therefore, those with Yale locks should quickly take precautions to prevent losses.</p>
<p>Recent News from the Cooperative Business Promotion Association: The Shanghai Cooperative Business Promotion Association, led by Shi Bohang, Chen Weifan, Wang Longzhang, and Du Gang, has established a Cooperative Society Staff Training Institute to promote cooperative businesses and cultivate cooperative business talents. The first class of students was enrolled and began studies on October 1st of last year, with five months of training. At the end of last month, graduation exams were held. Fifteen students, including Hua You San and Ying Shisun, passed and were approved for graduation. The association believes that the Social Affairs Bureau is actively promoting cooperative businesses, but there is still a shortage of talent. They plan to recruit a second class of students soon.</p>

<h3 id="e208">How to Study the Constitution <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The following discusses several main issues in our Constitution:</p>
<p>(1) Land Issue: Even scholars of the scholar-official class acknowledge that land rent is an unearned income, the increase in land value is a result of social development, and land harvest is the product of tenant farmers' hard work. Landowners' compensation for land can be said to be entirely due to the social system rather than any contribution or sacrifice made by the individual to the land. In advanced industrial countries, because industrial forces dominate, this issue does not seem serious, but it cannot be said to be completely resolved. In backward countries like ours, the land issue is an urgent problem facing us, especially because of the rural economic bankruptcy in recent years, which has further exposed the suffering of tenant farmers. Their land harvests cannot be sold at a good price, yet they still have to pay rent. Therefore, even though many people are thinking of superficial remedies, they are still moving towards decline day by day. Most people do not realize that the core of this problem is production, and politically, it is the vast number of farmers demanding land and improving production methods to develop agricultural productivity. Therefore, if we consider the development of the entire society, this problem cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>According to the current solution, in principle, land is jointly owned by the public. However, on the other hand, it also stipulates that those who have legally acquired ownership still have ownership. Therefore, this principle of "joint ownership by the public" is even more empty than "sovereignty belongs to the entire people." If the land is privately owned, then why is it also jointly owned? Even if it is said that the increase in land value can be heavily taxed by the state, and its benefits can be shared by all the people rather than enjoyed exclusively by the owners? However, whether the state's interests can be equally enjoyed by all the people is still a question. Moreover, the increase in land price is a secondary issue. The focus is whether the general farmers can fully enjoy the harvest of their labor in using the land. Therefore, legislators should seriously consider this issue and stipulate appropriate principles in the Constitution.</p>
<p>(2) Nationalities Issue: With the unbalanced development of industry across regions, there is a distinction between advanced and backward nationalities. As a result of mass production, there has been the fact of national oppression. Moreover, due to the crisis of capitalism itself, advanced countries are increasingly fierce in their oppression and exploitation of minority nationalities or backward nationalities within their own countries. Therefore, the issue of minority nationalities should have detailed provisions in the Constitution to safeguard the spirit of national self-determination and reduce the generation of national conflicts. There are two such safeguards: (1) Strictly guarantee the equal political participation rights of minority nationalities. The number of representatives to the National Assembly from each nationality should be equal, and each nationality should have the right to handle its own political affairs. (2) The principle of national equality alone is not enough, and the phenomenon of national discrimination is still unavoidable. Therefore, it should be stipulated that each nationality has the right to independence. This is a prerequisite for implementing the spirit of national self-determination and should not be ignored. Some argue that if the right to independence is clearly defined, minority nationalities will be incited by imperialism to split, and after the split, the minority nationalities will inevitably become colonies of imperialism. In fact, this is unfounded worry, and this will never happen in reality. If all nationalities within the country can be truly equal, there will never be a split. Imperialism will not only fail to incite the separation of minority nationalities but will also strengthen their determination to unite and jointly form a solid anti-imperialist alliance. Conversely, if close ties cannot be established and a few nobles among the minority nationalities are used, separation will still be unavoidable even without this provision. When the Soviet Union recognized the right to independence of all minority nationalities in the Declaration of Laborers, each minority nationality felt oppressed by the past Tsarist government and declared independence one after another. However, after independence, due to the threat of imperialism, they still united into a large federation. Our country does not recognize the right of national separation, but there have been serious national conflicts such as the independence of Xinjiang and the demand for autonomy in Inner Mongolia. In short, mutual trust and cooperation between nationalities depend on whether there are objective conditions for trust and cooperation. To guarantee the spirit of national equality, the right to independence must be stipulated.</p>
<p>(3) Livelihood Issue: Labor-capital disputes and tens of millions of unemployed people are the main symptoms of today's society. The key to solving these problems lies in the transformation and development of China's national economy. Therefore, if we want the proper development of society, we must first lay down all the conditions for developing the national economy. At the same time, we should not adopt the principles of capitalism, but take the state's operation as the center of the economy, creating the requirements of the economy on the one hand, and restricting private capital development and gradually moving towards a society of common production on the other hand. This is the trend of China's economy today. In this transformation of the national economy, the masses should naturally be given the opportunity to participate in production management to accelerate the improvement of the masses' lives. Guaranteeing all survival rights and raising the level of general culture are the contents of building a national economy. Only then can we talk about the people's livelihood today, otherwise, everything is empty talk.</p>
<p>(4) Education Issue: Education is a right that everyone should enjoy. Therefore, it is not enough to only receive general education and compulsory education to be equal. Higher education is also something that everyone should enjoy. However, in a commodity production society, apart from a few people who can receive higher education, most people can only sigh at the top universities. Even compulsory education may not be affordable for ordinary people. The children of ordinary people reach the age of education, but they cannot go to school because they do not have the leisure to study. They need to earn some money to supplement their family's livelihood. Therefore, equal educational opportunities seem to be just empty words. If we want equal education, we must first eliminate the obstacles that prevent equal education.</p>
<p>(5) Women's Issue: The women's issue is not a special issue. The liberation of Chinese women and the liberation of the entire nation cannot be separated. However, in China, there is an extra layer of traditional feudal constraints. Generally speaking, women's status in society is different from men's. Therefore, we should specifically protect the status of women in the Constitution.</p>
<p>The above are just a few main issues. Because the editor drafted the manuscript hastily and the space is limited, there are bound to be omissions. Fortunately, the purpose of this article is to contribute a little guidance for readers' research. The real research still needs to be done by the readers themselves and cannot be satisfied with the shallow description in this article.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Records of Lingering Imperial Fragrance <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Written for this publication by Princess Der Ling</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>Princess Der Ling once wrote the book "Two Years in the Forbidden City", which has long been popular. Later, while she was in the United States, she heard that publications were circulating, but because she was separated by the ocean, she had not had the opportunity to see them, which was her greatest regret. Last year, I saw her new book "Imperial Incense" and read it through. It is no less than an unofficial history of Empress Dowager Cixi. Being a blood-related sister separated from her by thousands of miles, I cannot help but feel a sense of the division of our family. Judging from her structure and style, Rong Ling can only look up to her, like Ziyou and Zixia, I dare not utter a word of praise. However, some of the events listed in the book are described in such flowery language, like mirages, making them intangible. As my conscience dictates, I will try to verify them. For example, regarding the section on Empress Dowager Cixi and Ronglu, after checking the records, Empress Dowager Cixi entered the palace at the age of sixteen. At that time, Ronglu was serving outside and was still a child. They had never met face-to-face, so where did the love come from? In the tenth year of the Republic, General Joffre of France came to China. Rong Ling was among those who prepared for the reception. The float he rode in Tianjin was the one mentioned in the book. In fact, after the float was made, Empress Dowager Cixi never had the opportunity to ride in it. As for the palace shoemaker and other matters, they are even more fictitious. After checking, the Empress's shoes were always made by the wives of the princes and nobles. Recalling the Xuantong era, my sister and I entered and exited the palace and served the Empress for the longest time. However, my sister left the palace before the Empress passed away, and Rong Ling left the palace after the Empress passed away. The difference between them was three or four years. As for the minute details of the forbidden city, Rong Ling seems to know them more accurately. Therefore, I will not hesitate to provide a clear testimony to help my sister collect the relics of the previous dynasty. If this book is novel and exciting, it can be read as a novel for leisure and entertainment. But if it is regarded as a record of events, then it is half a mirage, empty and untrue, and it inevitably hurts loyalty and honesty. Remembering Mr. Cai Yuanpei's "A Dream of Red Mansions" research, which details the story of Dong Xiaowan, his moral character and writings are admirable. Moreover, Rong Ling cannot help but speak out for my beloved sister. I offer my sincerity. Let De Sister be the judge of my guilt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rong Ling is currently compiling a book in English about the events of the late Ming Dynasty and has no free time. After I finish my work, I will carefully verify each item in English to let European and American readers understand the truth of this book. Because Mr. Qin is translating and publishing it, I will briefly mention a few points as a token of responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="e210">"Qingming" <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>The season when parasol trees are in bloom, peach blossoms are in full bloom, and rapeseed flowers are brilliantly yellow; when swallows fly back and forth in the tender breeze of willows – these are the characteristics of "Qingming."</p>
<p>In our villages, during this period, every family invites relatives for a big feast at home. Even poor families will borrow money to hold one. Because farmers, merchants, and artisans are busy all year round and rarely have the chance to meet each other, this opportunity allows them to "narrate emotions in a secluded manner." Think about the many festivals passed down from ancestors; on a specific day, each family relies on superstitious customs to eat pastries, such as zongzi for the Dragon Boat Festival and cakes for the Double Ninth Festival. In fact, this is entirely because the wise people of that time felt sorry for the dull and frugal lives of farmers, merchants, and artisans; they came up with this method of adjustment. The meaning of Qingming is definitely not entirely about superstition. Secondly, Qingming is a festival when travelers yearn for their hometowns, and everyone thinks of their hometown, returning to visit the tombs of their ancestors. At the same time, they enjoy a day of reminiscing in the clan temple, with "young and old gathered together," discussing everything related to the clan. If they encounter complicated matters and do not have the money to seek legal remedies, they often rely on the collective opinion in the clan temple to determine right and wrong. Moreover, both parties cannot resist and will definitely not resist.</p>
<p>From this, we can experience that the intrinsic function of "Qingming" is twofold: first, it shows the people's initiative in uniting scattered emotions; second, it shows that the people can also handle their own disputes.</p>
<p>If someone can promote this kind of festival gathering, and encourage and expand it, I personally believe that the effectiveness of this organization is more powerful than wildly shouting slogans!</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Mentally Ill are True Heroes <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>The Eugenics Society raised the plan and question of eradicating epilepsy and madness. After expert research, it was felt that this kind of neurological disease makes a great contribution to human progress. An examination of the world's great achievers reveals that many suffer from mental illness. George Ives and Muhammad suffered from mental illness; Napoleon I, Alexander, and Saint Paul suffered severely from it. If there had been an Eugenics Society in ancient times that implemented its treatment procedures, I am afraid that most of the great heroes in history would have been lost, and the progress of society would be very different from what it is today. Currently, the German government castrates both men and women suffering from epilepsy, madness, and infectious diseases. The intention is solely for improving the breed. However, like Sima Qian writing the "Historical Records" and Wei Zhongxian comparing himself to Confucius, castration cannot resist the spread of erroneous ideas. Originally, a genius scholar, a creative master, must have the function of his nervous system to express his great fantasies. If the French Rousseau had not suffered from nerve degeneration, he would never have been able to produce the "Social Contract." If the German Marx had not suffered from extreme madness, he would never have been able to produce "Das Kapital." But all geniuses and great men have inextricably linked themselves with mental illness. In the theory of scientific improvement methods, it is to be regarded as the product of sin and the source of poison. But in the explanation of the principles of hereditary diseases, it is certain and unshakable, and has a very great effect. This is what I recognize as the mentally ill being true heroes. A unique and startling conclusion.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p>
<p>Generously Baring One's Heart, Forgetting the Family to Serve the Country</p>
<p>Sadly Facing the Jade Mirror, Lamenting My Waiting Man</p>
<p>The rain on the roof, pattered and hissed, making one feel the cold air invading the room, chilling from the legs straight to the waist. Not to mention how cold the air was, even the covered kerosene lamp on the table emitted a blue light, constantly sinking downwards. The wind in the sky, carrying raindrops, beat against the window lattices, especially where there were paper holes, through which the evening breeze drilled in, attacking the body, creating a feeling of desolation. After a while, the raindrops grew larger, pattering sporadically on the window, further causing one to feel endless sorrow. Thus, one propped one's head with one's hand, leaning against the table and sitting. The items on this long table were all gifts given when one got married, namely a pair of vases, a small clock, and a round mirror with a carved flower frame. The carved flower frames were all in the style of hollowed-out clouds, just like holding up a moon in the middle. One remembers that on the wedding night, two bright red candles were lit, shining brightly, reflecting the red light in the mirror, making one feel that the room was filled with joy. But now the joy has disappeared, leaving only the small kerosene lamp with its bean-sized flame, illuminating the room dimly. One remembers when Ziqiang was at home, one would sit and look in the mirror, one's face red and white, and Ziqiang would lean behind one's shoulder, looking into the mirror, laughing at one. But now, one is alone guarding this house, alone facing this mirror, and moreover, the mirror is dim and without light, and one cannot even see one's own reflection. If it were an ordinary family, at this time, the newly married couple would still be in their sweet period, but what about oneself? One is guarding an empty house. Because that night, one sighed deeply, and one's father-in-law heard it, causing him great worry, so he let oneself go to Beijing City. If one were to sigh again, adding to the father-in-law's worries, he would have to comfort me on behalf of his son. (351)</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Calendar Pages are Being Torn Off <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>When I get up every morning, without washing my face or rinsing my mouth, I mechanically glance at the calendar on the wall, and then quickly use two fingers to pinch it, and with a "tearing" sound, tear off yesterday's page. Perhaps this has become a habit of mine; every day when I get up, I must first tear off the calendar. I tear off one page after another, tearing away much time; tearing away several years; also tearing away the innocence of childhood; and also tearing away the lively youth; now it has been torn to the middle age with heavy forehead wrinkles. Keep tearing, tearing, tearing until the head is bald and the teeth are loose; the back is bent and hunched over; tear straight until "both hands are stretched out and both eyes are closed" and I can no longer tear. I think that tearing the calendar is a common thing, but it also contains the "process of life" and the "philosophy of life."</p>
<p>The calendar of the Republic of China, year 23. Tearing, tearing, three months have already been torn off, and there are still a thick nine months left, and I don't know how many patterns will be torn out. When I first had the knowledge to tear the calendar, I was still a loyal subject of the Great Qing Emperor, tearing, tearing, tearing away my thin braid; and tearing away the fate of Xuantong. After the establishment of the Republic, I tear the calendar every day, and every day there are new patterns to see, "North-South War," "Hongxian's Enthronement," "Zhang Xun's Restoration," and even the World War, all reflected with the pages of the calendar. The revolution was successful, and another anniversary was added to the calendar. However, the blows given by "September 18th" and "January 28th" also engraved the deepest and greatest painful marks on our calendar. Tearing, tearing, the years to come, the days of the future, one page after another are behind, I only hope that one page after another of the calendar will tear away our shame, tear away our trauma, and tear out a colorful picture of national prosperity and peace.</p>

<p>General Overview of Duan Inkstones</p>
<p>(5) The Value of Duan Inkstones: The above is a very brief overview of Duan inkstones, only discussing the points that those who study Duan inkstones must know. As for the former people's perspective on observing inkstones, and the basis for evaluating them, there are many differences, resulting in a lot of conflicting discussions, each holding their own opinion, forming a kind of faction, such as the dispute between new pits and old pits, the dispute between Zi stone and mountain stone; the dispute between valuing the ancient and valuing the modern; the dispute between valuing literature and valuing practicality; the dispute between the east cave and the west cave; the dispute between tenderness and firmness; the dispute between sound and silence; each has become a point of contention. Babbling and endless, how ridiculous this is! Although I am bored, I do not want to be verbose. However, there is still the question of the value of inkstones, and the high and low values are closely related to the purchasers of inkstones, so I will briefly say a few words.</p>
<p>The ancients described Duan inkstones as "worth a city" and "difficult to exchange for ten thousand gold," but only to describe their preciousness, not that they actually have such value. Su Yijian's "Inkstone Spectrum" says: "A naturally round and upright bluish-purple Zi stone from Duanxi, carved into an inkstone, can be worth a thousand gold," which seems more certain. However, this kind of Zi stone is ultimately difficult to obtain, and there is no certain value. Also, after checking Tao Fang's "Inkstone History," it says: "I have seen about five to seven hundred Duan inkstones in my life, and they are priceless above ten thousand," and Yunlin's "Stone Spectrum" says: "Pure Duan stones are also no more than ten thousand." It can be seen that the price of inkstones before the Qing Dynasty was not very high. Wu Shihua occasionally said the sentence: "Today's Laokeng Daxi Cave is ten times more valuable than Xiaoxi Cave Zhengdong stone, Xiaoxi Cave Zhengdong is ten times more valuable than Dongdong stone, and Kengziyan, Mazi Keng, and Chaotianyan decrease in order, but they are still several times higher than miscellaneous pits," (see Wu Lanxiu's "History of Duanxi Inkstones") and the Japanese have taken this seriously and calculated it. He said:</p>
<p>According to Wu's words, if the words "several times" are set as five times, for example, if an inkstone produced from a miscellaneous pit is worth one yuan, the one produced from Chaotianyan is worth five yuan, the one produced from Mazi Keng is worth six yuan, the one produced from Kengziyan is worth seven yuan, and the Dongdong is about twice as high as Kengziyan, so it is worth fourteen yuan. Xiaoxi Cave Zhengdong is calculated at ten times, then it is one hundred and forty yuan. If Daxi Cave is calculated at ten times more, it would be one thousand four hundred yuan. The famous materials of the true Daxi Cave are indeed very precious, and there is no need to say more about the Xiayan of the Song Dynasty. (See Ko Kaga's "Inkstone Talk")</p>
<p>Such a calculation shows that in the minds of the Japanese, the value of Duan inkstones is very high, and there are many Japanese inkstone enthusiasts. According to his boastful tone, "Many of the famous Chinese inkstones are now collected by Japanese inkstone lovers. The inkstone lovers in Tokyo have more insight than those in Kyoto and Osaka, and are richer in collecting famous inkstones. As for calligraphers and painters, for practical use, they feel that Duan inkstones are a hundred times better than Japanese inkstones, so they do not hesitate to raise huge sums of money to acquire them." The price of Chinese inkstones has been raised so high, which cannot be counted as the effort of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The general overview of Duan inkstones is finished, and below I will talk about She inkstones.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Telegram from the Second Branch of the Kuomintang in Manila and the Chinese Drama Association <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>To the All-China Sports Advancement Association, Shanghai Shen Bao: We resolutely oppose the inclusion or participation of the puppet pseudo-country in the Far Eastern Games. If Japan insists, we demand that our country immediately withdraw from the Far Eastern Games. Respectfully, the Second Branch of the Kuomintang in Manila and the Chinese Drama Association, the 31st.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Telegram from the Wang Clan Autonomous General Association of the Philippines <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>To Mr. Wang Rutang of the China Sports Advancement Association, Shanghai Shishi Telegraphic News Agency: The Japanese invaders have many tricks. They have instigated the rebel Puyi to claim the title of Emperor, and are now mobilizing the pseudo-country to participate in the Far Eastern Games, hoping to obtain de facto recognition. Our side rashly agreed to the roundtable conference and stated that if the pseudo-country participates alone, as a performance competition, our side has no possibility of opposing it. We will soon meet the rebels at the Far Eastern Games. All the overseas Chinese in the Philippines are extremely indignant upon hearing the news and vow to oppose it to the death. You are the president of the Sports Federation, and the honor and disgrace of the country are your responsibility. The clan loves you and hopes that you will be remembered for generations, not be infamous for all time. We hope you will argue with reason and do your best to prevent the pseudo-country from participating, preserve the personality of the nation for the nation, and leave a good reputation for the overseas Chinese. If you do not care about public opinion and shamelessly attend, it will surely cause great changes. Please cherish yourself and value the country. Respectfully, the Wang Clan Autonomous General Association of the Philippines.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Sports Authorities Determined to Reject <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>According to the sports federation authorities, they told the Shishi News Agency reporters that Mr. Wang Zhengting has not yet returned to Shanghai, but the Japanese are accustomed to using cunning tricks, and now they are releasing a smokescreen in an attempt to disrupt the hearing and achieve their goal of the pseudo-country's participation. This association has repeatedly stated its attitude, that this kind of action that forfeits rights and humiliates the country will never be tolerated. As for the roundtable conference, it is to discuss the affairs of the meeting during the conference, and it must be held once before each session. If the Japanese side raises this issue during the conference, we will resolutely refuse it, and even withdraw from the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Individuals Participate, Nationality Remains <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>According to the Far Eastern Games charter, the admission of new members must be approved by all members, so if we refuse, it will be difficult for the Japanese to succeed in their cunning plan. However, the Far Eastern Games has a kind of open performance, regardless of nationality, anyone can freely participate. What the Japanese are actively pursuing, the purpose may be here. It is likely that the Philippine side has fallen into their trap, and there are rumors that they have allowed it to participate in the exhibition matches, which has aroused the indignation of our overseas Chinese. In fact, our authorities have always adhered to a consistent position, and would rather withdraw than yield in the slightest. Because behind the participation of individuals, there is also the existence of their nationality. Overseas Chinese are very concerned about the motherland, which shows that the spirit of the people is immortal. In addition to having telegraphed the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and the New China Daily, etc., to explain everything, now that we have received this telegram, we will reply by telegram again within the day so that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia can understand the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Another Unfortunate Incident in the Football World; Eastern China vs. Western Concession Ends with No Result <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Both Sides Act Out of Bounds; Referee Misjudges Offside</p>
<p>Referee Leaves the Field Because Players Do Not Accept Punishment</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the Western Concession's Western Union Football League's Group A match at the China Baseball Field, an unfortunate incident occurred. The first half passed peacefully, but in the second half, after playing for fifteen minutes, Lu Zhongen took four steps while holding the ball. The referee blew the whistle and awarded a free kick. Chen Hongguang of Eastern China seemed to have a disrespectful attitude towards the referee. The referee expelled him from the field (because Chen had previously received a warning). Eastern China asked the referee to announce the reason, but the referee did not say why and resolutely left the field. The game ended with no result. Subsequently, there was a refund craze.</p>
<p>Acting Out of Bounds</p>
<p>The main cause of the turmoil was due to the excessive behavior of both sides. Referee Sinclair, the center forward of the Western Concession team, is also a newly appointed referee. The penalties imposed in the first half were considered appropriate, but in the second half, he became more and more strict, but the two offsides he judged against Eastern China were a bit off, causing dissatisfaction from Eastern China and the audience. At the same time, the actions of both sides became more and more blatant, and the grievances deepened. Fallas of the Western Concession and Chen Hongguang of Eastern China were each warned once, and the degree of out-of-bounds kicking was the same for both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Each Scores a Draw <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>In the first half, things were initially peaceful, and the game was very exciting. Later, suspicions gradually arose, and everyone had the intention of harming each other. Fortunately, the referee's strict penalties were able to end things peacefully. The Western Concession scored the first goal, which Fallas scored from 30 yards out. The ball landed and rolled quickly, and Lu Zhongen missed and let it in. But after the kickoff, Eastern China went straight to the yellow dragon, and Jia Youliang's header was kicked into his own goal by Fallas. Eastern China then made the result 1-1.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Each Receives a Warning <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Starting in the second half, the referee's inspection became stricter, but the rude behavior of both sides became more blatant. The referee judged Wan Xianghua's two offsides, (it seemed that Li Rongan and Wan also had one or two in the first half) which seemed to be a misjudgment, causing dissatisfaction from Eastern China and disturbances from the audience. Fallas and Chen Hongguang were both warned for misconduct, and the atmosphere in the stadium deteriorated.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Disobeying the Referee <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, after fifteen minutes, Lu Zhongen took four steps while holding the ball. The referee imposed a free kick as required, at a location five or six yards to the right corner of the goal. However, Chen Hongguang seemed to have a disrespectful expression towards the referee. The referee expelled him from the field. Lu Zhongen and Feng, the linesman of Eastern China, questioned the reason, but the referee did not answer and left the field abruptly. The game was abandoned halfway. How this matter will end depends on the solution of the Western Union Association.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Refund Craze <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The audience was in an uproar, but everyone stood still and did not leave, because they did not know the whole story. After waiting for a long time and the game did not continue, they asked for refunds one after another. The French police originally dispatched dozens of detectives and police officers to the scene, and seeing the situation, they dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order. The head of the Western detectives and the chief patrolman of the police station personally led them to the scene. The Sports Federation hurriedly handled the refund procedures. It was estimated that only more than 200 tickets for the one-yuan seat were sold, but more than 600 tickets were refunded. More than 2,000 tickets for the four-corner seat were refunded, reaching more than 3,000 tickets. It can be said to be an unexpected disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Youyou Defeats Racers <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>4-3 Group A Match</p>
<p>First Half: Two to Two</p>
<p>Youyou defeated Racers at Yiyuan yesterday. This was a Group A match. Jiang Shanjing was absent due to an event, and was replaced by Zhu Qiu. Wang Shusen repeated his old trick and served as the left fullback. Most of the Racers' strong players were gone due to other engagements. Most of those who played were newcomers, but their combat power was no less than that of Youyou. As a result, Youyou won 4-3, which was no easy task.</p>
<h3 id="e227">First Half: Two to Two Each <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The kickoff started the battle, Youyou's five forwards instantly mixed into the Racers' defense. Sun Tielui got the ball passed from Shen Shiqi and deliberately let Jia Qiu have it. Unexpectedly, the shot was weak, and Korkland easily caught it. Racers counterattacked, but it was difficult to produce results. Huang Ruihua blocked people in the center and was penalized. Lyle Oli shot, but Yang Mingjin shot it out. Before anything else, Xiao Zhong broke through the siege and went straight in, passing to the front of the goal. Sun Jinshun lunged in, but the referee considered it an offside, so it was dropped. Jia Qiu and Yong Sen's two horses roamed the palace, reaching another level, forming a 2-1 advantage. The battle was not over, and Brock got the ball and passed it to the middle. Ming Gezi shot, and Yang Jinming shot it out not far away, and Boselli arrived in time to send it into the net, making it another draw. The first half ended.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Youyou Works Hard to Win <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>After changing defenses, both sides seemed tired, and the battle situation was therefore very flat. You come and I go, and fifteen minutes passed in the ordinary and unremarkable. Xi Qiaosheng once had a sharp sweep, but unfortunately it was bounced off by Korkland's leg, so it didn't happen. At the 20th minute, Sun Tielui made a great effort and broke in with a single gun, scoring a goal. So Youyou's momentum became stronger. However, Liang Shutang touched the ball with his left arm in the penalty area and was penalized 12 yards. Boselli swept it in successfully, so the third draw was successfully achieved. At this time, Youyou's forwards were quite sharp, and in the last five minutes, Sun Jinshun scored another goal, and finally ended with 4-3. Youyou won the final victory.</p>

<p>In the first half, Daxia defended firmly, and the scores of both sides were not easy due to the lack of accuracy in shooting baskets. In the first half, Jinan took the lead with a score of 12-6. In the second half, Jinan gradually gained momentum and won Daxia with a score of 41-18.</p>

<p>The women's match between Jinan and Daxia was extremely tense. Jinan scored six points in a row at the beginning, with great momentum. However, the situation slowed down slightly due to Liu Mali's injury. In the second half, Daxia once chased to 12-8 and 14-13 close scores. However, Jinan's Lin Junfu penalized two points, and the situation was set again. Although Lu Lanfang scored, it was too late.

<h3 id="e237">Zhejiang Basketball Team Loses to Lizhi Society in Beijing <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-one to Forty Points</p>
<p>(Beijing Dispatch) After defeating Soochow in Suzhou, the Zhejiang Basketball Team arrived in Beijing on the 29th. At 9 PM on the 30th, they played a friendly match against the Lizhi Team at the Lizhi Society Hall. The Lizhi Society is the second team of the military academy and has formidable strength, with fierce attacks. Ma Qinghe’s tall physique and power allowed him to score repeatedly. Zhao Yuanlin of the Zhejiang Team is short but brave, and Wang Pusheng's shooting is accurate; both are skilled basketball players. However, because the Lizhi Society hall is 63 meters long and the lighting is insufficient, dribbling was difficult and long shots were more suitable than close-range shots. Zhejiang did not adapt to this situation and missed several opportunities. Ultimately, they lost by a score of 31 to 40, which is deeply regrettable. In the first half, Lizhi led 11 to 13. After the break, Wang Pusheng of Zhejiang made repeated outstanding contributions, once surpassing Lizhi. However, Wu Zanrong’s long shots were frequently successful, and Zhejiang players Wang Zhizhen and Wang Dian’an, who were already playing while sick, were further injured due to the intense Beijing match. Therefore, the originally scheduled friendly matches with the Public Recreation Team and other teams in the next two days had to be canceled.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Chinese Basketball Court Completely Destroyed by Fire <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Fire broke out at approximately 11 PM last night; cause unknown.</p>
<p>The French Concession Fire Brigade responded to the scene to extinguish the fire.</p>
<p>The Chinese Basketball Court on Rue Father Lebbe in the French Concession, part of the Shanghai National Amateur Athletic Federation's sports grounds, was the largest indoor basketball court in Shanghai. The internal stands could accommodate 1,500 to 2,000 spectators. Unfortunately, at around 11 PM last night, it was suddenly visited by the Fire God and completely destroyed. The entire French Concession Fire Brigade was dispatched and did its utmost to extinguish the fire, but because the entire structure was made of wood, the flames were extraordinary, leaving only an empty shell. After three quarters of an hour, the fire gradually weakened.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Speculations on the Cause of the Fire <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 6 PM, the Shanghai basketball team, preparing to participate in the national preliminary round for the Far Eastern Games, practiced at the court. Afterwards, a foreign basketball team practiced. It was discovered that the fire started in the restroom next to the bathing room. The surroundings of the room were filled with bamboo scraps, wood shavings, reed mats, and other flammable materials. The cause of the fire is generally believed to be that basketball players carelessly discarded cigarette butts while using the restroom, which ignited the fire.</p>

<p>Zhang Huiqing, an employee of the Amateur Athletic Federation, lived with his family of seven inside the basketball court. Servants Wan Zhao and Fulin also lived there. Fulin was still in the writing room, while the rest were fast asleep and completely unaware of the fire. Fortunately, a gentleman from Yuzhen Lane across the street saw the fire in the building and immediately knocked on the door to wake Zhang and the others, allowing them to escape. However, their belongings could not be retrieved.</p>

<p>The basketball court was built as far back as ten years ago, managed by a Westerner named Gray. Since the Amateur Athletic Federation took over in 1925, it has been repeatedly repaired and the stands expanded, making it the only great indoor basketball court in Shanghai today. Men's and women's basketball competitions are held every year. The national basketball selection for this year's Far Eastern Games was also scheduled to be held at the court. Unexpectedly, it was completely destroyed by fire last night. The location for the selection of the Chinese basketball team will have to be arranged elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="e247">Shanghai Branch of the China Cultural Construction Association Established Yesterday <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>More Than 300 Members of Groups and Individuals Attended</p>
<p>Charter Passed and Directors and Councilors Elected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Cultural Construction Association held its inaugural meeting at the Huzhou Society on Guizhou Road at 2 PM yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Members: Attendees included Wu Xingya, representative of the Municipal Government; Tao Baichuan, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters; Pan Gonglu, representative of the General Association; members Wu Kaixian, Zhang Shiyong, Li Zhaozhong, Huang Zhaoxiong, Wang Yunwu, Ma Chonggan, Lin Zhongke, Pei Fuheng, Fan Zhongyun, Zhang Zhuping, Meng Shouchun, Chen Jicheng, Lu Shibai, Jiang Jianbai, Wang Xinming, Xu Ze , Tang Zeng, Xu Xingchu, Xu Zejun, Wang Longzhang, Han Juemin, Liang Shaowen, He Xiya, Xu Zhuodai, Zhang Yiping, Shao Zuiweng, Chen Dongbai, Zhu Ying , Liu Xiuru, Ding Mocun, Chen Jinmin, Wu Zhiqian, Chen Bai, and group members including the Opera Discussion Society, Municipal Education Association, Greater Education Federation, Chinese Education Federation, University Federation, Modern Thought Society, Southwest Review Society, Micro-speech Weekly Society, Lion's Roar Literary Society, Literary Spring and Autumn Society, Foreign Affairs Society, and Courage Society, totaling more than 300 people.</p>
<p>Chairman’s Report: The presidium consisted of Zhang Shiyong, Zhang Zhuping, Fan Zhongyun, Ding Mocun, Wang Xinming, Lin Zhongke, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Jicheng, and Pei Fuheng, totaling nine people. Tang Zeng served as recorder, and Shen Zurui as master of ceremonies. After completing the ceremonial formalities, Chairman Jiang Jianbai gave a report, stating that the association was established in accordance with the charter of the General Association and based on the Three Principles of the People to build a new Chinese culture. The colleagues felt that the environment in Shanghai was complex and cultural construction was needed, making it more important than any other place. China's current culture has not been organized for its inherent aspects, nor has it applied what is needed from foreign sources. Therefore, the culture that China needs still lacks solid construction, and the survival of the nation depends entirely on culture, highlighting the importance of the cultural mission, especially in Shanghai, where trends are disseminated. Therefore, this association was established today in accordance with the charter of the General Association and will follow the guidance of the General Association and the instructions of party and government agencies to work for the revitalization of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Address by the Party Headquarters: Tao Baichuan, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered an address, stating that there are two important points to building a Chinese culture that is suitable for the times, which he would like to offer to everyone. The first point is not to forget the spirit of the nation, and the second point is not to forget the spirit of the times. A culture that can be built to simultaneously include the national spirit and the spirit of the times is the culture that China needs. Looking back at China’s past thousands of years, there has been a very glorious culture. However, because the ancients did not organize it, later scholars have largely neglected China’s inherent culture, believing that foreign culture is superior to China. Currently, the political science, economics, sociology, and education studied in general schools all introduce Western ideas, while China’s inherent ideas cannot be known for their strengths due to the poor organization work. Students do not look for cultural ideas in ancient Chinese books. Therefore, besides the ideas created by foreigners, they do not know that China has had many excellent cultures in the past that also meet the needs of the times. If we do not do this promotional work, it will definitely decline in the future. Therefore, it is hoped that in one or two years, due to the establishment of the China Cultural Construction Association, the first step will be the publication of books on various political, economic, social, and educational subjects that integrate Chinese and Western knowledge, so that future generations will know the greatness of China's institutions and that China also has things worth studying. Therefore, it is hoped that the Cultural Construction Association will organize China's past history, not forget the spirit of the nation and the spirit of the times. As for Western culture, such as social organizational power, material civilization, and scientific spirit, which are lacking in our country, we should catch up with the spirit of catching up and absorb them as much as possible. We should use scientific methods as the principle of building culture, so that the nation and the times are combined to produce a new culture. Therefore, the organization of the association must be to work together to formulate cultural plans and cultural work.</p>
<p>Address by the General Association: Pan Gongzhan, representative of the General Association, delivered an address, stating that the General Association of the China Cultural Construction Association was established not long ago, and seeing the establishment of the branch today has greatly increased the courage of the comrades of the General Association to engage in culture. The center of gravity of the China Cultural Construction Association is entirely in Shanghai, so the headquarters of the General Association is also located in Shanghai. However, the work of the General Association must also take into account other provinces and cities, so the Shanghai branch is expected to shoulder the burden of the Shanghai side. How the General Association's achievements will be demonstrated in the future depends on how the Shanghai branch performs. The undertakings that the association should handle are stated in the charter, such as publication, news, education, film, opera, fine arts, music, and other matters related to the nation are included. It is hoped that the groups or individuals who join the association will all make efforts in their original research undertakings in accordance with the purpose of building a new Chinese culture based on the Three Principles of the People. However, all previous individuals or groups doing cultural work lacked a center. After the establishment of this association, it is hoped that the previous disorganized, unregulated, and independent cultural work will be changed into planned cooperation, and that the Shanghai cultural community will plan a unified solution.</p>
<p>List of Staff: Following the passage of the charter, directors and councilors were discussed. Those elected were: Tao Baichuan as Director-General, Jiang Jianbai and Wang Xinming as Deputy Directors-General, and Zhang Jixin, Chen Baohua, Jian Wanqiu, Shen Zurui, Du Gang, Huang Jingzhai, Xue Guangqian, Gu Jiwu, Yi Lirong, Yao Sufeng, Zhang Renruo, Lin Meiyan, Xu Suling, Huang Hao, Tang Zhengyang, Liu Xiuru, Xu Zexiang, Xu Shifu, and Yuan Xueyi as Directors. The elected councilors were Xiao Youmei, Wang Jiyuan, Lu Bin, Shen Junsheng, Zhou Xianwen, Zhu Zhangbao, Fan Zhongyun, Qiu Hanping, Chen Jinmin, Lu Yinquan, Li En , Chen Zehua, Chen Gaorong, Zhang Shilu, Shao Zuiweng, Yang Minshi, Huang Zhaoxiong, Leng Xueqiao, Kang Xuanyi, Chen Jicheng, Yuan Yeyu, Gu Zhongyi, Wang Zhongxian, Chen Jilie, Shen Songquan, Dai Pengtian, Xu Xingchu, Chen Kecheng, He Xiya, Wang Hanzhang, Zhang Yiping, Tang Jinbai, Zhou Leshan, Huang Xianggu, Bu Wancang, Zhao Shusheng, and Zhu Xuefan, totaling 37 people.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Various Cultural Organizations Hosted a Banquet for Albert Thomas Last Night <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>More than 100 people including Li Shizeng and Wu Tiecheng attended</p>
<p>Thomas gave a speech on the mission of intellectual laborers</p>
<p>Twelve organizations, including the World Cultural Cooperation China Association, the National Central Research Institute, the National Peiping Research Institute, the National Jinan University, the World Electrical Engineering Society, the China International Library, the Sino-French University, the Sino-French Industrial School, the World Academy, the Library Publishing School, the World Society, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, hosted a banquet for Albert Thomas, Director of the International Labour Office, at the World Society on Ferguson Road last night at 7:00 p.m. During the banquet, Li Shizeng introduced Thomas's speech, entitled "The Mission of Intellectual Laborers in Modern Life," and the Datong Orchestra performed national music. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: A total of more than 100 people attended, including Li Shizeng, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Tiecheng, Liu Zhanen, Li Shuhua, Chu Minyi, Ding Xielin, Wang Xiaolai, Li Denghui, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Junqi, Hua Lin, Yang Yunzhong, Lin Yutang, Shen Pengfei, Zhuang Wenya, Yang Guangzhe, Du Chongda, Chen Hexian, Hu Tianshi, Cui Lian, Yu Hongjun, Li Dachao, Chen Guangfu, Ye Yuhu, Weng Zhilong, Wang Yunwu, Wu Yunshu, Zhang Zhuping, Wang Boqi, Liu Hongsheng, and foreign guests such as the French Minister and the Dutch Minister.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: First, Chairman Li Shizeng gave an introductory speech, saying that today they were welcoming Mr. Albert Thomas and, at the same time, saying farewell to Mr. Thomas because Mr. Thomas would be leaving China in the shortest possible time. Mr. Thomas is a famous educator and also the Director of the International Labour Office. It is a rare opportunity to have Mr. Thomas come to the meeting to give a speech today.</p>
<p>Thomas's Speech: Next, Albert Thomas gave a speech, translated by Zhang Junqi, entitled "The Mission of Intellectual Laborers in Modern Life." He briefly stated that the question of the mission of intellectual laborers is very serious and is related to the maintenance of civilization and the maintenance of life. However, the general public has two attitudes towards this question: (1) to despise intellectual laborers, and (2) to value intellectual laborers. Leaving aside the latter, the reason for the former's contempt for intellectual labor is that modern people, due to material civilization, do not have much time for intellectual life, and in the current environment, it is not suitable for the life of intellectuals. In fact, this view is completely wrong. All material inventions are full of wisdom and full of brainpower. For example, the invention of machines is by no means a mere fantasy; it must come from wisdom. Modern life has two foundations: (1) hygiene, and (2) education. Hygiene and education are nothing but intellectual work. France divides mankind into three classes: (1) capitalists, (2) laborers, and (3) intellectuals. This classification is also incorrect because there are many intellectuals among laborers, so labor and wisdom cannot be separated. As for the mission of intellectual laborers, in addition to applying it to practical problems, it must also be extended to society, the country, and the international community. There are many international disputes in modern times, and the reason is that the wisdoms are different and cannot be understood. In the future, only the intellectual circles can unite, exchange opinions, and study problems together so that there is no barrier between countries. The League of Nations has established an International Cultural Cooperation Association to undertake this work. The Chinese side has also established the China Association, which has a great deal of strength. At the same time, the treatment and status of intellectuals should be improved. Therefore, the International Labour Office has organized an Intellectuals Committee, whose work is to improve the lives and status of intellectuals.</p>
<p>Musical Performance: After Thomas's speech, the Datong Orchestra, led by ancient music expert Zheng Qinwen, performed national music. The program was as follows: (1) Ensemble performance of Oriental Great Music; (2) Jin Zuli's pipa solo, entitled "Frontier Tune"; (3) Wei Zhongle's guqin solo, entitled "Drunk Fisherman's Evening Song," which was extremely subtle and exquisite. The event did not end until around 9:00 p.m.</p>

<p>2.  Compulsory education and adult literacy education must be provided free of charge. Compulsory education has long been regarded as a national education policy in various countries. Since the rise of nationalism, this type of education has been included in the powers of the state. Therefore, although there are many meanings of compulsory education, the most important is the meaning that "the state has the obligation to provide the necessary resources and facilities for the minimum national education and to use legal force to compel all school-age children in the country to receive training." Since the state has the responsibility and obligation to provide this type of education, it should not collect any fees. The reason is very clear; otherwise, not only will the national education policy not be implemented and the original intention of compulsory education will be lost, but also the promotion of compulsory education will be hindered, and the goal of universalization will be difficult to achieve. After the implementation of the New Economic Policy in Soviet Russia, tuition fees were once collected, but they were soon abolished. Other countries in the world, except for the Netherlands, almost all provide compulsory education free of charge. Those that state this in their constitutions, such as Spain, stipulate that primary education is free of charge; Portugal stipulates that compulsory primary education is implemented and no tuition fees are charged; Turkey stipulates that the provision of primary education is generally not remunerated; Lithuania stipulates that primary education is free of charge in schools established by the state or autonomous bodies; Greece stipulates that primary education is compulsory and should be paid for by the state; Finland stipulates that education in primary schools is free for everyone; Poland stipulates that national and local public schools are exempt from tuition fees; Estonia stipulates that primary schools are free, etc., all of which can be verified. Compulsory education and primary schools in China have always been one. Although Article 16 of the Primary School Law promulgated by the National Government clearly stipulates that "primary schools do not charge tuition fees," it is followed by the phrase "but may charge fees as appropriate depending on local conditions." Thus, the principle established is tantamount to a fundamental overthrow, so that most primary schools today still collect fees arbitrarily and even have something to rely on. In Nanjing and Shanghai, one is the capital and the other is a commercial metropolis. Educational funds should be easier to raise than in the interior. However, primary school tuition fees have not only not been waived, but the amount collected often exceeds the fixed amount by several times, which is tantamount to imposing additional taxes on those who fulfill their obligations, which is very regrettable. Article 35 of the chapter on education in this draft constitution stipulates that "the people of the Republic of China have equal opportunities to receive education," which seems to have taken into account the current trend of equal educational opportunities. However, China's social and economic decline has reached an extreme, and most people are unable to provide adequate food and clothing, making it difficult to force them to bear their children's tuition fees in reality. If schools are still allowed to charge fees freely, although opportunities are equal, those who actually enjoy them may never have the hope of equality. Judging from the current state of the country, it would be unrealistic to make all levels of schools free of charge. However, compulsory education is the foundation of national education. In order to realize the national education policy and facilitate its implementation, it must be absolutely stipulated that no fees of any kind should be charged, so as to prevent the habit of charging fees as a principle and free of charge as an exception from occurring in various places in the future. As for adult literacy education, it is a remedial measure for the military and the illiterate. The objects of this type of education are all people who were born poor and lost the opportunity to enjoy compulsory education in their youth. The state should also stipulate that it should be provided free of charge, so as to eliminate illiteracy throughout the country as soon as possible.</p>

<p>丨Each market price finds the highest record丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market in the Chinese Securities Exchange in Shanghai was still strong. It did not show any signs of decline due to the long period of rising, nor did it cause large investors to sell due to the high market price. The sale of number 38 was said to be a very large amount, but at present, it is a limited price and unlimited amount, and there is no concept of suppressing the market price. It can be known that there must be actual goods. On the buying side, the northern gang has a lot of short covering, and the appetite of large investors is still very strong. The trend continues to move forward, and even the May salt tax is approaching 55 yuan. At the close, each market price found a new record high. It is becoming more and more dangerous for it to continue to rise like this, but when the bulls of large investors have not yet emerged and the bears of large investors do not dare to go short boldly, the future of the market price cannot be seen to fall immediately. Ninety-six still has a sign of struggling, but if the environment changes slightly, the fall will also be greater. Yesterday's process: In the morning session, most of the prices returned to a small two or three corners to four and a half corners, among which the far-term demobilization and 19 Customs were slightly better by about a corner. In the second session, large investors successively bought in, and they all returned to two or three corners. In the afternoon, at the opening, number 11 added to their positions, and numbers 20, 30, and 37, etc. had a greater need. The market price was still firm, and most continued to improve by about two or three corners. The unified salt tax was relatively flat and tired. At the close, the raising surface had another short covering, and it rose by another two corners or so. Throughout the day, the 22-year customs tax rose the most, with a total increase of nine corners. The rest mostly rose by two or three corners, and the whole six rose by four and a half corners. Each price was a new high price. The total transaction volume was 13,636,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods and 13,635,000 yuan in futures. The 7-year long-term government bonds, which have not been opened for nearly a year, suddenly had a market price of 71 yuan yesterday, which was due to transfer reasons. The second session also failed to buy it at 74 yuan. The results of yesterday's market price increase and decrease are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>丨丨Due to Competitive Sales, Selling Prices are Instead Cheaper丨丨</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation was extremely decadent. Due to the deterioration of the surrounding environment, all kinds of prices are trending down. As a result, the sales of cotton yarn are declining, and all parties lack purchasing power, which has led to a gradual increase in the manufacturer's inventory. However, the Yunnan gang is still healthy in its appetite, but the selling prices are 2.5 to 5 jiao cheaper due to the competitive sales of various factories.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Marker Yarn is Slack <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The market of marker yarn opened in the morning, and the popularity was slightly boosted due to the rise in US cotton. Each month rose by three or seven jiao. In the afternoon, there was a lack of sellers in the market, and the spot yarn market price was soft again, and the selling wind rose again. Each month rose by five, seven, eight, and nine jiao to one yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 21,800 bales. It was found that Dafu sold 3,650 bales, Senkang 950 bales, Dachangcheng 500 bales, and Yiyu 500 bales. Dafeng bought 1,000 bales, Gengfeng 650 bales, Chunj 550 bales, Suilong 550 bales, Changfeng 2,500 bales, and Yuantai 500 bales.

<p>Spot yarn sales continue to be smooth, and the Nanbu area still buys the most. The total number of bales purchased by various gangs throughout the day was 1,610, and the market was flat. The amount purchased by each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 470, Ningbo 10, Sichuan 250, Zhenjiang 10</p>

<p>The cotton market started to rise and then fell. Although US cotton rose, silver prices rose, and yarn prices fell daily, the factories were in trouble and demand decreased. Moreover, the price ratio between yarn and cotton was too far apart. Therefore, people's hearts were watching low. As for the high price of US cotton and the low price of Indian cotton, the price ratio between US and Indian cotton was 10 yuan per dan, which shows that the cotton market is still difficult to rise greatly.</p>

<p>The market of marker cotton rose with US cotton in the morning, and scattered short positions were covered. Each month improved by one-half to two jiao. In the afternoon, due to the lack of buyers, each month fell by 0.05 to 0.15 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 53,700 dan. It was found that Changfeng sold 7,300 dan, Hengyi 1,900 dan, Yuanda 1,000 dan, Dafu 1,000 dan, Renfeng 1,300 dan, and Yuanxingchang 2,700 dan.

<h3 id="e262">Pessimistic Northeast Cotton Yarn and Cloth Market <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Okuri of the Dalian branch of a certain Japanese trading company, the trend of the cotton yarn industry in Northeast China depends entirely on how the sales of agricultural products are. The prices of agricultural products have plummeted this year, and farmers are extremely impoverished. The purchasing power of cotton yarn and cloth has naturally declined. According to the current situation, it is difficult to be optimistic. General consumers only purchase necessary items. This is not only the case for cotton cloth, but also for Indian cotton yarn, which has little buying interest. Originally, when market prices fell, futures trading completely disappeared. The so-called inability to generate false demand can only supply a small amount of actual demand. The current sluggishness of cotton yarn and cloth is due to the fundamental reason that the countryside is declining, and the erosion of rayon is also one of the reasons. Recently, the demand for rayon has gradually increased.</p>

<p>The market was calm during the week. Brokers closed out long positions, inquiries about exports were disappointing, and exporters bought very little. However, Bai Luoxi cotton futures trading was quite active. The tax rate from the countryside to the city will be abolished on April 1. Therefore, the cumulative number of receipts announced between the 23rd and 26th of this month was 45,691 bales less than the same period last year. At the same time, the arrival of Bai Luoxi and Aomura was also less than last year. However, Kangtai and Xi Kangbudi and other flowers have begun to emerge.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange continued to trend downstream. Both the morning and afternoon markets opened at four points. Transfers plus water were not opened and done. It was all white transfers. The market atmosphere was loose and outrageous. The market for interbank lending was also relatively quiet. Interbank lending turnover was over 4.3 million in the morning market, new transactions were over 400,000, and turnover was over 200,000 in the afternoon market. Transactions in the small general assembly were over 300,000, transactions in foreign collateral were over 500,000, banknotes were recovered over 300,000, and the amount issued was over 700,000. The source of customer funds was only 150,000. Bank collections were rare because foreign merchants were still in the closed season and completely shut down. Only Chinese banks were conducting transactions as usual, and collections were also sparse. It is estimated that ticket collection was over 1.6 million, and various freight, exchange, tax collateral, and miscellaneous collections were less than 2 million. Warehouse withdrawals were 200,000, money shop foreign public single collections were over 35 million, various remittance funds were over 400,000, foreign transfer collections were over 2.1 million, and cash collections were over 100,000. In addition, the total number of exchanges at the Shanghai Clearing House on the 31st was 11,098,078.28 yuan in silver dollars, including 4,556,139.21 yuan in silver dollars and 6,541,939.07 yuan in exchange transfers.</p>

<p>During the entire month of March, the call loan market for silver dollars was entirely "white lending" (lending without interest) for the first half of the month, with no market price at all. It was only from the 16th that a market price of 2 fen appeared. Therefore, the entire month only had half a month's worth of value, totaling no more than 5.4 jiao, with each day only amounting to slightly over 1.8 li. It is anticipated that the upcoming general meeting will propose interest rates, but the rate will likely remain fixed at 2.95 yuan after deductions. The sluggishness of silver funds can be seen from this.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Stable Situation of Rice in the River Downstream Grain Market <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) More than 40 sources of various merchant guilds (over 6,000 shi), with thick and thin japonica rice each accounting for half. In terms of sales destinations, late-season rice is more popular, although merchant guilds from other provinces have stopped buying, while those from Tianjin, Weihaiwei, and Yantai in northern China continue to show interest in purchasing. However, the situation is not as strong as it was a few days ago, likely because of initial rumors about a customs closure around the Gregorian calendar Qingming Festival, leading to some hesitation. Later, it was confirmed that customs would not be closed and would continue normal operations, so everyone started to be more proactive. As a result, the overall situation was slightly affected. In total, more than 2,000 packages of Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xilian rice were purchased. As for the issue of consumption, sellers took advantage of opportunities to drive up prices, so even though merchants still wanted to be demanding, they could not. The market situation is stable, with no significant price fluctuations. The stock of each merchant guild’s thick japonica rice has slightly improved, and the market situation seems to be tightening, but prices have not yet shown any significant changes. The goods from Changbang and Nangang are settled, while those from Sutongbang have seen a slight increase of 0.02 to 0.03 yuan due to the scarcity of goods. Du Yangjian and Yinbianyuan rice have not shown any significant fluctuations.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 42 or 43 boats arrived from various routes downstream of the river. Sales of various types of rice in the market remain lackluster. Prices for various types of rice, including white japonica, various grades of pointed rice, early thin rice, and Yinbianyuan rice, are fixed. White Yuan increased by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Medium-Grain Rice from Other Provinces Continues to Rise by 0.05 Yuan <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for medium-grain rice from other provinces continued to be strong, as Fujian merchants were actively buying. There was continued interest from the main street and Wenzhou. Although the purchases from Wenzhou were not as high as those from Fujian, they were consistent daily, which helped to stimulate the market. Yesterday, the entire city sold 6,310 packages of various types of rice. The main street purchased 200 packages, and Wenzhou purchased over 1,000 packages. The rest was all purchased by merchants from Fujian province. The main destination in Fujian was Fuzhou, with Xiamen only purchasing 220 packages. There was still a shortage of rice from Hunan and Jiangxi. Arrivals continued from Wuxi, Nanjing, Jiangbei, and Shashi, so the market could not rise significantly. Except for medium-grain rice from other provinces, which rose by 0.05 yuan due to active purchases from Fujian merchants, other types of rice remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Soybeans Rise by 0.03 to 0.04 Yuan <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market saw a slight increase of 0.03 to 0.04 yuan due to limited new supplies and consistent sales from factories, with continued purchases from other merchants. However, future price fluctuations still depend on factory demand. Yesterday, factories purchased four truckloads of Yingzhou soybeans, Fujian merchants purchased one truckload of Zhushan soybeans, and the main street purchased 300 packages of Quanhe fertilizer soybeans and 200 packages of Quanhe soybeans, as well as two truckloads of Zhushan soybeans. Green soybeans are more stable than yellow soybeans and are considered specialty goods. Because supply and demand are evenly matched, the market price is quite firm. Yesterday, Ningbo merchants purchased 20 packages of Niuzhuang green soybeans and 200 packages of Guide green soybeans.</p>

<p>(Record Low Discovered) New York in the United States has many silk weaving factories, making it the largest port for silk consumption in the world. Recently, due to sluggish sales of silk products, silk weaving factories have reduced production, cut working hours, and shut down machines, leading to a sharp decline in silk consumption. Furthermore, aggressive dumping of Japanese silk has caused silk prices to plummet endlessly. The standard raw silk (i.e., Japanese silk) has broken through the $1.30 USD per pound mark, equivalent to approximately 420 yuan per package (100 catties) in Chinese currency, reaching a new record low. Chinese silk, Shanghai white factory grade B, 80 points, 20-22 denier, is offered at 450-460 yuan (in Chinese currency), but there are no buyers. Qili dried spun silk has prices but no market. Since the beginning of spring, there have been no new transactions, and sales of Chinese silk to the United States have reached a dead end.</p>
<p>(Reverse Spun Silk Becomes Increasingly Scarce) Reverse spun silk produced in Mutown and Qingyang in Anhui Province is running out of stock at the production site, and sources are becoming increasingly scarce. Yesterday, only 26 pieces arrived from Datong and were awaiting sale on the pier.</p>
<p>(No Market for Foreign Silk on Christmas) Yesterday was Christmas Day (commonly referred to as Foreign Qingming). Foreign merchants and banks were closed, and there was no exchange market. Foreign firms are taking a four-day holiday as usual, and the foreign silk market is closed. Domestic silk factories are reluctant to purchase yellow and white spun silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang due to high prices and are taking a wait-and-see approach. There is little news from the silk market.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Childrearing Problems</p>
<h3 id="e286">A Rational Solution to Childrearing Problems <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yuan</p>
<p>Traditional concepts passed down through generations tightly bind the hearts of the Chinese people, and the progress of most undertakings is only reflected in following the past and copying the old ways. Chinese villages still use the same production tools they have for thousands of years to make a living, and small-scale handicrafts and businesses in the interior are still stuck in their original processes. "Childrearing" naturally cannot escape the circle of inherited customs, and similarly falls into the trap of copying old methods without seeking innovation.</p>
<p>Of course, with the introduction of foreign civilizations, there are now more scientific methods of childrearing, and in fact there has been a belated implementation of childrearing, but this, just like other new undertakings, is only manifested in the upper-class lives of a few cities and among some intellectuals. At least, it is out of the question for the vast rural areas and the majority of the middle class who lack scientific knowledge. If we continue to work on the development of the childrearing cause in this way, it will still be of no help to the nation or to society.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the problem of childrearing is no longer a simple medical and infant education problem. Now, especially in China, which is urgently seeking national liberation, the problem of childrearing has become a social problem of considerable seriousness; it is related to the future of the Chinese nation and to the salvation and improvement of the lives of women. Therefore, childrearing is not just a personal or family matter, but should be a cause, and a movement, seeking a wider and more universal development. This is why we need to specifically propose "cooperative childrearing."</p>
<p>In the past few years, some people have proposed cooperative childrearing plans, but they have only been seen in theory, and they are still rare. As for practice, cooperative childrearing is naturally non-existent in the present, when all cooperative undertakings are still in their infancy. Our current need to promote cooperative childrearing is by no means to talk about a new theory to catch up with the times, and our purpose is certainly not for the convenience of a few upper-class lives and some intellectuals. We must promote the cause of childrearing with the dual prerequisites of national rejuvenation and women's liberation. Because: firstly, we believe that childrearing is not only personal but also social, so only the method of cooperative childrearing (pooling economic resources, hiring experienced and knowledgeable nannies, and raising children collectively) can achieve results. At the same time, only the method of cooperative childrearing can make it universal. Secondly, cooperative childrearing is much more economical in terms of cost than individual rearing. The success of cooperative childrearing can reduce the burden and pain of the vast number of working women and other vulnerable women. Thirdly, the realization of cooperative childrearing societies is also a partial success of women's liberation. Women engaged in social undertakings will not be affected by childrearing and affect their careers. Fourthly, we want to replace the old methods of the past with scientific childrearing methods, and only the method of cooperative childrearing can be effective. Because only a cooperative childrearing society is a reasonable and safe childcare center.</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation of childrearing in China, it can be said that it has become an obstacle to national rejuvenation and women's liberation. On the one hand, the infants themselves are mostly sick, stupid, and rude as a result of unscientific upbringing and spoiling or inability to love. How can such children not affect the future unsoundness of the country and the nation! On the other hand, it goes without saying that most vulnerable women feel the burden and pain of childrearing. Even women with better economic ability and higher intellectual level are often affected by childrearing problems, leading to their own unsoundness and the failure to develop their careers. These are all undeniable facts.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should strive to penetrate the knowledge of cooperative childrearing into rural areas, factories, small cities, and small towns, and widely popularize the organization of cooperative childrearing throughout the country. Those engaged in the women's liberation movement cannot lightly discard this problem; no one who is working for national revival can ignore this issue. We must do our best to seek a satisfactory solution and completion of the problem of childrearing in the practice of cooperative childrearing.</p>
<p>As for the aspects of the cooperative childrearing movement that should be carried out, here are a few points that may be briefly mentioned:</p>
<p>1. Cooperative childrearing societies are best organized by enlightened people in various places, taking the facts as the basis for the cooperative childrearing movement in each place. Then, to various counties, towns, and even villages.</p>
<p>2. Party departments at all levels, as well as local social education institutions and women's associations, should give the public a strong promotion and advocacy of cooperative childrearing in their respective locations.</p>
<p>3. Women's schools should add courses on cooperative childrearing.</p>
<p>4. Any movement, as long as you bury your head in doing it, do not sing high-sounding tunes, and do not shrink back, the completion of cooperative childrearing also depends on such people.</p>
<p>We further hope that the women's community will pay more attention to cooperative childrearing. And then get a bigger effect. Otherwise, simply shouting for the improvement of childrearing to the women's masses is tantamount to empty talk, and it is not enough to seek the realization of childrearing reform for only a very small number of people.</p>
<h3 id="e287">Childrearing Problems and Working Women <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Hua</p>
<p>Childrearing problems can be divided into two points: one is the prenatal and postpartum recuperation of the mother; the other is the parenting methods after the birth of the infant. These problems are not a problem for wealthy families. Only working women who are whipped by life feel difficult and painful.</p>
<p>The daily nutrition and sufficient sleep of women are essential elements of healthy motherhood, and excessive labor and poor working conditions during pregnancy are not allowed to protect the mother and fetus. According to the general opinion of the medical community, women should have four weeks of rest before delivery and six weeks after delivery, because the uterus can only return to its normal state in the second month. Working too early often causes the uterus to droop, bleed, or become inflamed, or even cause infertility and mental illness. However, under the capitalist system, women have become wage slaves, and the intense, excessive, and unsuitable work for women has caused great damage to their bodies; insufficient nutrition and sleep have further deprived them of their health; generally, they only rest for five or six days before delivery, and after this, they must enter the factory to work, and life becomes a problem. Under these various ravages, the mother and infant cannot maintain their health and fall ill. According to a survey by Harpur Kings, among women of the European bourgeoisie, 9.17% suffered from miscarriage, and 9.85% suffered from stillbirth. Working women accounted for 17.89% of miscarriages and 32.57% of stillbirths, with the latter increasing three times compared with the former. From this comparison, we can also see the pain of working women.</p>
<p>Childbirth is a difficult hurdle for working women, but after passing this hurdle, the rearing of the infant is also a problem. The mother enters the factory, and the infant is thrown at home to starve and freeze, and the narrow and unclean living environment has a great impact on the infant's growth; as for the parents' lack of training in raising children,｜｜only emotion, lack of reason｜｜ also cultivates bad habits such as willfulness, greed, and selfishness in their children. In terms of education, working parents cannot talk about their children either.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, pregnant and nursing mothers are prohibited from doing factory night work. Before and after childbirth, mothers are entitled to four months of leave, with wages paid as usual. For six months after childbirth, female factory workers are entitled to an average of two hours of exceptional rest per day.</p>
<p>Children under the age of three are sent to nurseries at 7:30 in the morning, where caretakers manage the babies, arrange games in a scientific way, distribute food, and teach hygienic knowledge and collective consciousness. In 1929, 55,600 children entered nurseries in cities and industrial centers, increasing to 385,000 by 1932. In the main industrial sectors, more than 75% of female workers enjoy the convenience of nurseries. Other kindergarten education, public catering facilities, public laundries, public playgrounds for children, and social insurance are also developing day by day.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Chinese working women suffer even more than those in capitalist countries! Under the devastation of imperialism and feudal forces, factories in cities are reducing workers and closing down, and wages are extremely low. Malnutrition, insufficient rest; the Factory Law that stipulates that wages are paid for six weeks of rest before and after delivery is only a dead letter. In rural areas, natural and man-made disasters occur frequently, and farmers even use tree bark, mud, and wheat seedlings as food, so-called nutrition, so-called rest is even more out of the question, and mothers and infants have no way to maintain their health. According to the sixth issue of Zi Huan Monthly, the mortality rate of Chinese mothers is terribly high, with as many as 176 out of 1,000 people (in capitalist countries, it is less than this, with Denmark accounting for 2 per 1,000, Japan accounting for 3.33 per 1,000, Italy accounting for 3.37 per 1,000, the United Kingdom accounting for 3.38 per 1,000, Germany accounting for 57 per 1,000, and the United States accounting for 71 per 1,000). In terms of children, the mortality rate is also very high. According to Mr. Zhang Zhenzhi, "In various countries, 69 out of every 1,000 infants die, while in China, 50 out of every 100 people die, and in Hebei, as many as 75% die." The high mortality rate of mothers and children indicates the seriousness of the childrearing problem in China, and also indicates the bleak future of the Chinese nation! On this day of advocating the revival of the nation, if we do not seek to solve this basic problem, there will be no hope for the future of the nation, and I hope that the people of the country will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e288">A Brief Discussion on Children's Parasitic Diseases <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Described by Medical Consultant Chen Fangzhi</p>
<p>Parasites specifically refer to soft-bodied animals that parasitize the human body. Although tiny protozoa such as malaria and dysentery, and skin mites such as scabies and autumn lice, also parasitize humans, this term is usually not used. Therefore, the four words parasitic disease seem scary, but in fact the scope is very narrow; especially for children living in cities. There are not many opportunities for infection. Some parasitic diseases have local limitations. The parasitism rate is extremely small. So the scope is also narrowed accordingly. Now I will separately discuss the parts that are universal in urban and rural areas, and the parts that are limited to spreading in rural areas: Generally, those that are mostly transmitted through the mouth are more universal. Those that are not transmitted through the mouth, but through other routes, are mostly limited.</p>
<p>A. Parts that are universal in urban and rural areas:</p>
<p>1. Roundworms: The most commonly seen parasitic disease in children. This is the most common, and in places with the highest parasitism rate, this disease is often found in more than 90 out of 100 people. For children in Shanghai, according to the reports of inspectors, it is between 15% and 30%, which cannot be said to be small. The signs of onset are: pica. Good appetite. Nausea. Vomiting. Diarrhea. Or excessive sleep saliva. Abdominal colic. Systemic anemia. There are also reflex nerve-spasming symptoms. (Spasms, loss of consciousness, etc.) Come suddenly, parents think it is a serious illness, and the whole family is in an uproar, but in fact it does not matter much, and it can recover soon. Roundworms mostly parasitize in the small intestine. Generally, their eggs are brought in from unclean water and vegetables, etc., and hatch into larvae in the intestine, and after 30 to 40 days, they grow into adult worms, and can excrete eggs to the outside. To spread around. The medicine to expel them is "Santonin", the active ingredient of fresh Artemisia flowers, which is more effective. Ganji candy contains this medicine. Other marine algae and Quisqualis indica are also often effective, but Santonin can be toxic, so you must pay attention.</p>
<p>2. Whipworms: They are also widely distributed and often parasitize at the same time as roundworms. The parasitism rate is smaller than that of roundworms, and the symptoms of the disease are also lighter. In general, it is similar to roundworm disease. It is mainly characterized by persistent diarrhea and anemia. However, its parasitic site is in the cecum of the large intestine. The worm is 3 to 4 cm long, which is only one-fifth or one-sixth of the roundworm. The route of transmission is roughly the same as that of roundworms, with eggs being brought in from food and hatching in the intestine. Thymol is mostly used to expel the worms. But it often needs to be used in conjunction with enemas.</p>
<p>3. Pinworms: They are shorter and smaller than whipworms, only one-tenth of their size. They cannot be found in the stool unless you pay close attention. The eggs are also not as easy as roundworms and whipworms. The egg-checking method can be found with an ordinary microscope. So it is often difficult to diagnose. The parasitic site is in the rectum, not far from the anus, so the sick child often has anal itching or burning sensation, and after scratching, congestion and inflammation occur, which often causes sleep disorders. Apart from this, there are no other severe symptoms such as roundworms and whipworms. The way of infection is initially through food and drink, and then because of scratching the anus. The eggs are then brought into the mouth from the fingers, and the cycle continues, called self-infection. To expel them, garlic juice, or vinegar juice, or tannic acid juice is mostly used for enemas.</p>
<p>4. Tapeworms: There are intermediate hosts, which are cattle or pigs. If you eat raw beef and pork, you can sometimes be infected, but it is definitely not as common as the above three worms. The worm parasitizes in the small intestine. Patients often have abdominal pain, vomiting. Digestive disorders. Or abnormal digestion. High anemia, etc. The worm has sections, and the sections are connected, sometimes reaching 20 to 30 meters in length. The medicine to expel them is Dryopteris or pomegranate root bark, but they are all drastic drugs, and should not be taken casually.</p>
<p>Of the above four types, except for tapeworms, which are slightly dangerous, the other three types, after the patient is parasitized, only have repeated illnesses and pains, and there is no life-threatening danger.</p>
<p>(B) Parts limited to locality.</p>
<p>1. Hookworms. (or duodenal worms) They mostly invade the human body through the skin. Rural herdsmen and villagers. Are forced by their occupations. Expose their hands and feet. In order to come into contact with feces and fertilizers, it is the only way to get infected. Especially in areas where sericulture is flourishing, moist floating soil is suitable for their hatching, and infection with the disease is particularly common. After infection. Most fall into severe anemia, which over time can easily lead to bleeding, loss of appetite, and weak heart, often leading to death. The worm is only three or four cents long. It parasitizes in the duodenum. The medicine to expel them is mostly Thymol, or Dryopteris preparations.</p>
<p>2. Blood flukes: They also invade through the skin and parasitize in the hepatic portal vein, which can cause cirrhosis of the liver and endanger life. They spread to 13 provinces in our country, and there are many yellow-faced, big-bellied, and short-statured sick children in places where blood flukes produce a lot. But in large metropolitan areas. There is no chance of infection. Because of the lack of intermediate hosts. There is no way to expel this worm. It is more effective to kill it with needles and medicine.</p>
<p>3. Fasciolopsis buski: Xiaoshan County and Shaoxing County in Zhejiang Province are the most famous immersion areas. After its eggs are hatched, the larvae enter the intermediate host, the Planorbidae, and after asexual reproduction, they come out of the water and attach to aquatic foods such as water chestnuts, and children who eat them raw will be infected with the disease. Sick children often have developmental disorders. Or diarrhea, abdominal pain, anemia, and dysentery. The worm is as big as a thumb and shaped like a thin slice of ginger, hence the name. The medicine to expel it is mostly Thymol.</p>
<p>The above seven types are common parasites. The symptoms of other parasites, such as liver flukes, lung flukes, Trichinella, and filarial worms, are very different from what ordinary people call children's parasitic diseases; and these diseases are relatively rare. Therefore, they are omitted.</p>
<p>"Note" The symptoms inquired by Mr. Yu Jizhi of Jiangdu are definitely pinworms. If the mother and grandmother suffer from this, it is called family infection. Among parasitic diseases, only this pinworm disease has it. Taking too much deworming medicine. Of course, it is not suitable.</p>
<h3 id="e289">The Conflict Between Career and Motherhood <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yang</p>
<p>When discussing women's career issues today, it is already outdated nonsense to talk about whether women should or should not have careers, or whether they are suitable or not, from the standpoint of gender. The current demand of women for careers and their gradual acquisition of careers is an objective and natural trend of social development. The ancient saying of "men manage the outside, women manage the inside" has long been crushed by the wheels of the times. Therefore, when discussing this issue now, we should take an objective standpoint, experience its content from the actual career life, explore its essence, and then point out the path it should take.</p>
<p>Women of the middle and lower classes are increasingly feeling the difficulty of life due to the impact of the overall social downturn. Therefore, a large number of them have entered banks, companies, shops, and various vocational institutions in society to serve as employees, or as elementary school teachers. Women in the lower classes have no choice but to enter factories in large numbers, sell their labor, and even sell their bodies, due to the pressure of life. Even those married women, although many of them regard marriage as a "nursing home," in fact, not only is the income of men alone insufficient to maintain life, but also in this present society with many unemployed people, not every man has a career, and even those who already have one are constantly living in terror of the danger of unemployment, so they have no choice but to leave their families, abandon their children, and run to society to find various careers. The increasing number of female teachers, female workers, and female employees is a fact.</p>
<p>Modern women's careers, from their own point of view, although they have given women the opportunity to be economically independent and break away from parasitic life, on the other hand, the burden of family chores and raising children has not been reduced in the slightest. Especially the work of raising children makes working women feel an indescribable pain! Working women of the upper class can still hire nannies and maids to raise their children, but working women of the middle and lower classes rarely have this possibility. As for those working women who "do one day and eat one day," life is a problem, let alone hiring a nanny or maid to take care of their children. Therefore, in any country, the mortality rate of children in worker areas is always more than twice as high as in other places.</p>
<p>Working women are forced by life to solve the problem of eating first, and put the family and raising children in a secondary position. When the work is over, they run home exhausted and have to breastfeed and raise children and deal with all the family chores. Therefore, the career and motherhood conflict, and the life of working women is burdened with another layer of heavy burden, and at the same time, their spirits are also increased by another layer of pain!</p>
<p>But how can we avoid this conflict and resolve this contradiction? Of course, we cannot, like Ms. Ellen Key, see that the career is harmful to motherhood and fundamentally advocate that women return to the family and regard raising children as their natural duty. This is not only a method of "throwing away the baby with the bathwater," but also impossible in reality. We should try to remedy this harm from the career itself, turn family chores into social undertakings; hand over the work of raising children from the hands of mothers to the hands of experts, and turn it into a part of social undertakings, so as to avoid the conflict between career and motherhood, and to thoroughly eliminate the burden and pain of working women!</p>

<h3 id="e290">The Importance of Nurseries <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Nourishment</p>
<p>Nurseries are already very popular in the Soviet Union, providing most people with immense convenience and satisfaction. Now, some people in China are advocating for the establishment of pilot nurseries. However, many have expressed opposition, believing that taking children away from their loving mothers' arms and entrusting them to strangers is akin to sending them to foundling hospitals or other charitable institutions for upbringing. This is because they do not understand the nature of nurseries. Now, I will briefly describe the nature and importance of nurseries below:</p>
<p>(1) Children Receive Scientific Care: The organization of nurseries cannot be compared to foundling hospitals in China. The most important aspect of establishing nurseries is to pay special attention to children's health and education. Therefore, the facilities of nurseries must be very complete. Nannies must receive special training. All work outlines should be determined by experts in children's affairs, doctors, nurses, psychologists, and others. After the decisions are made, they should be published in newspapers so that the general public can participate in discussions. Then, after review by children's affairs experts, they should contribute their own theories and experiments to determine a system. All management policies of nurseries are based on scientific explanations given by physicians regarding the necessary physical functions of children. Children with illnesses, regardless of severity and type, are sent to children's hospitals or clinics for diagnosis and treatment. In addition to these nurseries, there should also be experimental nurseries. This is because it is felt that knowledge and methods of caring for young children require thorough research and improvement. Therefore, this experimental institution is specifically established to accommodate ordinary children, allowing the most excellent child experts to research new methods to raise children.</p>
<p>(2) Reducing Obstacles to Women's Economic Independence: It is undeniable to people with clear minds that women should be economically independent. However, for women who have been bound by families for thousands of years, the most difficult problem to solve when they want to leave their families and participate in social undertakings is that there is no one to take care of their children. Because of this problem, many women abandon their careers and return to their families to raise their children. Therefore, people who oppose women's careers often use this fact to resist and as an excuse. If there are well-organized nurseries in society, then working women can send their children to the nursery from seven or eight in the morning and pick them up again in the evening. In this way, mothers' work will not be affected by their children, and the biggest difficult problem for women seeking economic independence will naturally be solved.</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned facilities and educational methods in nurseries, they are more complete and harmonious than general family childcare. The people who care for the children are experts and must have good training and knowledge. Therefore, parents can absolutely rest assured that sending children to nurseries can receive modern scientific care methods. And this method is by no means the "children are owned by the state" that ordinary people rumored, which completely cuts off the relationship between parents and children. After work every day, parents can still bring their children home and share family happiness. Women demand economic independence and gender equality, but they are often constrained by children and burdened by trivial family matters. If this system can be adopted, it can at least be said that it is the beginning of women's liberation.</p>
<h3 id="e291">Hoping for Nurseries <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Li</p>
<p>The poorer people are, the more they fear having children, but children come even faster.</p>
<p>I am nearly six months pregnant, and worry and annoyance are growing in my heart day by day. I feel that this is a major problem.</p>
<p>Under the pressure of life, my husband and I have to go to work separately to make a living. In the near future, we will have to take leave to await childbirth, and the source of income will have to be borne by him alone. Saving a little, there will certainly be no problem before childbirth.</p>
<p>What I find most difficult is the problem after childbirth. Hiring a wet nurse would require providing her with housing and meals, which we, who barely make a living, certainly do not have the spare capacity for. Breastfeeding myself would mean ending my future, as I would not be able to go to work, and life would be unimaginable at that time. However, this is the only way.</p>
<p>"Can't we have a nursery?" Our group of economically independent women often hopes for this. Indeed, if there were a nursery, I could send my baby there and pay a reasonable price each month, which would be of great help to me! I can still work, without being subjected to the pressure of life, and provide the child with a well-trained body.</p>
<p>I remember a friend telling me that there is a nursery in Shanghai, which was said to have been founded by people from the Shenbao newspaper. By paying twelve yuan per month, your child can live safely inside, and they hire professionals to take care of the children very thoughtfully. - But I inquired with others and everyone said they didn't know. I wonder if there is really such a nursery established to seek happiness for us working women?</p>
<p>I am looking forward to it.</p>
<p>I cannot give up my career, and at the same time, I cannot abandon this future little citizen.</p>
<p>I deeply look forward to it: before the child is born.</p>
<p>Editor's Note:</p>
<p>The Shenbao newspaper does not have a nursery. However, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association does have a plan to organize a nursery, which is currently in preparation and will soon be officially established.</p>

<p>Answer to Mr. Huang Ruilan from Bengbu.</p>
<p>Question: Chest pain with shortness of breath. According to your letter, it is probably a stomach ailment. It started one or two months after conception, and is related to pregnancy-induced acid reflux. Taking Chinese medicine cured it, which means the acid reflux period has passed. Afterwards, the dates of the pain became closer, which may have caused a real stomach ailment. This cannot be clarified by letter inquiry. Arsenic acid can sometimes lighten skin color, but it is a highly poisonous substance. Do not take it indiscriminately without a doctor's guidance.</p>

<p>Early Summer of the 23rd year of the Republic, Written for</p>
<p>The Grand Occasion of the Congress of the Chinese Medical Association  Respectfully Wishing from The National Federation of Physicians</p>
<h3 id="e294">Congratulatory Message from the Shanghai Medical Association <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>On the occasion of the Chinese Medical Association's meeting in the capital on April 1st of the 23rd year of the Republic, as bright spring days gather gentlemen in one hall, how magnificent! Truly a grand spectacle. Medicine is a matter that emphasizes both academics and profession. The purpose of our association is to protect the profession, while the gathering of your association relies even more on promoting academics. Separated, the efforts are divided and dispersed; united, the efforts are concentrated and focused. This is why the unity of the two associations is necessary. Therefore, based on this meaning, we offer this message:</p>
<p>The meaning of the association lies in unity,</p>
<p>Academics and profession must be combined.</p>
<p>If one is lacking,</p>
<p>Like riding without reins or a car without tracks.</p>
<p>Magnificent congress gathers in the capital,</p>
<p>Unveiling essence to amaze the ignorant.</p>
<p>Knowing that on the day of return,</p>
<p>It is the time of spiritual unity.</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing from the Shanghai Medical Association</p>
<h3 id="e295">The Significance of the Chinese Medical Association Holding a Congress Zhu Hengbi <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>Medical congresses in Eastern and Western countries are extremely grand events. They have the encouragement of the government and the welcome of society. The number of attending physicians is at least several thousand, and often exceeds one or two thousand. New medicine in our country has a small number of people, and the scale of each congress is far inferior to that of advanced countries. However, in the past twenty years, there has been considerable progress. I still remember that at the first congress of our association, only a few dozen people attended. At the last congress, there were over five hundred people. The number of registered attendees at this congress has exceeded the number of the last congress. At the first congress, there were only a dozen or so papers, and many were urged by telegram. Even if the content was slightly inferior, it was included in the agenda to fill the length. There was no distinction between internal and external departments. Now, the number of papers submitted to each department is increasing daily, and those that arrive later can only be reluctantly abandoned and not used. Moreover, there are many subjects, and the division into groups for discussion has reached as many as eight categories: internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, public health, dermatology and venereology, radiology, pathology, and physiology. During the congress, experts gather in one hall to question and debate. The benefits can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Building a car behind closed doors cannot lead to conformity. This is true of everything, and science is no exception. Using one's own achievements for others to scrutinize, if there are any shortcomings, it is not difficult to discover them. This is the first benefit of the congress for individual academics.</p>
<p>(2) Academics are public property of the world. Anything gained should be published openly, breaking the bad habits of secretiveness in old medicine for thousands of years, so that academics are not treated as private property. This is the second benefit of the congress for the population.</p>
<p>(3) As far as we know, there are often research experts who compile the results of their daily work into volumes, and over the years, they cannot find their way through them. Now, urged by the congress, they must be busy organizing them. Thus, what was previously buried in the laboratory can now be organized and completed and made public to the world. This is the third benefit of the congress, which can promote the organization and rectification of research materials.</p>
<p>(4) When the congress is about to open, everyone competes to submit papers. Those who were previously lazy in research will now want to show their skills. Those who have always liked research will also double their efforts. This is the fourth benefit of the congress, which can encourage researchers.</p>
<p>(5) There are thousands of members in our association, scattered all over the world. Usually, they only exchange news and information through letters and magazines, and it is often difficult to speak their minds freely. Now that there is a congress, members from all over the east, west, south, and north gather in one place to discuss the improvement of the medical community and the promotion of public health. This is the fifth benefit of the congress, which can gather wisdom and benefit extensively.</p>
<p>(6) General assembly affairs, without a congress, would have incomplete reports, and motions may not be fully implemented, leading to neglect. Now, with this congress, staff members cannot but double their efforts, each seeking to be worthy of their position, and the association's affairs are progressing rapidly. This is the sixth benefit of the congress, which benefits the association's affairs.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that although the congress program has only a few chapters, each word and sentence represents the crystallization of the thoughts and efforts of thousands of members over the past two years, and is not accidental. After the closing of the congress, the members of our association will return to their original places, taking their gains and continuing to study them in order to deepen their knowledge. During the closing period, they will work, and during the congress, they will report on their work and discuss it openly. The cycle continues endlessly, and progress is made without limit. It is not like ordinary congresses, where resolutions are not made or implemented. Therefore, although the members of our association hold a congress only ten times in two years, the spirit of research has never been diminished even for a single day. At this time, when the number of members is not very large, a congress every two years seems to be enough. In the future, as the association's affairs develop and the number of people increases, it will inevitably be held annually. If there is too much research material and it cannot all be included in the annual congress, then it will inevitably be necessary to hold small-scale local meetings, or as the number of specialized talents increases, in addition to the congress, there will also be specialized congresses. There are already physiological congresses, pathological congresses, etc., and the implementation of departmentalization is a beginning.</p>
<p>In short, the more scientific conferences there are, the greater the contribution to academics. All the papers solicited at each congress of our association are published in the Chinese Medical Journal. At the beginning of the journal's establishment, it was bilingual in Chinese and English, with four issues per year. Now, Chinese and English are divided into two sections, with twelve issues each per year. The original works contained therein have gained high praise from the medical community at home and abroad. Our association has more than 1,700 members, one-third of whom are physicians from various countries in the East and West. This kind of mixed academic group is only seen in other countries, and it can be said that it can practice the meaning of academics without international boundaries. This congress is held in the capital, and we are grateful for the hospitality of the authorities, the support of academic groups, the encouragement of the press, and the benefits of discounted train fares from the Ministry of Railways. It can be seen that all sectors of society in our country have high expectations for our association. Our colleagues can only work harder to live up to the expectations of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e296">The Association Has a Major Mission Pang Jingzhou <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>(Members Have a Major Responsibility)</p>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association, in its past history and present reality, in addition to academic research, is indeed also involved in research on business, medical education, health administration, and all issues within the scope of medical affairs.</p>
<p>The association itself is formed by gathering medical colleagues from all over the country, so it has more unity and national character than any other organization.</p>
<p>Precisely because it is an association formed by gathering colleagues from all over the country, it should have the vision and insights to see all parts of the country.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this transitional era of the new China, I think the focus of medical improvement is still on several associations, and each member simultaneously bears a significant responsibility. Therefore, the words, actions, and thoughts of each member have a major impact on the future of Chinese medical affairs.</p>
<p>When the association holds a national congress, it is especially an opportunity for each member to fulfill their responsibilities. Therefore, I would like to ask each member to always keep in mind the improvement of Chinese medical affairs, and especially to pay attention to the exchange of views between colleagues in one place and colleagues in other places, so as to obtain a kind of standard that is suitable for the whole country.</p>
<p>Although there is more than one medical association in China now, since most members can exchange views in one meeting and obtain good directions, then why can't two associations exchange views in one country and obtain more appropriate solutions?</p>
<p>Members fulfill their responsibilities in the meeting and seek the improvement of Chinese medical affairs, and they must have the common goal of all people, and they must have a comprehensive vision. The two associations jointly seek the improvement of Chinese medical affairs, and it only lies in the words, actions, thoughts, and vision of each member.</p>
<p>Dear members, please always be mindful of your position, which has the authority to influence the entire Chinese medical community.</p>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association is holding a congress in Nanjing, and the Shenbao is publishing a special issue. Jingzhou was asked to write an article, and Jingzhou respectfully uses these words to wish all members attending the congress good health and success.</p>
<h3 id="e297">Prospects for the Association's Future Work Song Guobin <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association is holding this congress in the capital for the second time since its merger with the Bo Medical Association. I am fortunate to be able to participate in this grand event. The association's work in recent years can be seen from Mr. Zhu Hengbi's article "A Review of the Past Year," which shows the intensity of the work and the remarkable achievements. Everything that I had hoped for from the National Federation of Physicians has been fully realized by the association, which is truly in line with the conditions for the survival of the group. I would like to briefly present a few points based on my thoughts as a supplement to the association's future work, which I hope will be approved by the members:</p>
<p>(1) Proposal to Establish a Medical Research Institute: The research institute is the highest academic institution in the country. Regardless of the type of science, those who want to explore its profound realm all rely on the establishment of the research institute. Since the government established its capital in Jinling, it has paid attention to education and professions in the country, and thus the Central Research Institute was established. All disciplines in the arts and sciences have everything they should have, but medicine, the crystallization of science, is still lacking. Because of this, medical school graduates in the country and returned students from overseas want to continue their research, but they suffer from a lack of appropriate institutions. Academics have no end, and the key lies in continuous research. Now that there is a lack of this kind of research institution, advanced medicine is stopped midway, and those who love learning go against their wishes. Old knowledge is feared to be neglected, and new knowledge has no hope of creation. This is regrettable. Our association is the highest academic institution in the national medical community. It seems that it should take the stand of promoting academics and take the important measure of saving academics, urging the government to add a large-scale medical research institute within the shortest possible period and within a possible range, so that the students will not be abandoned midway, and the prosperity of medicine may be able to rival Europe and the United States. This is the first.</p>
<p>(2) Preparation of Draft Regulations for Physicians: The government has formulated and promulgated regulations for various industries, accounting for seven or eight out of ten. However, regulations for physicians have not been promulgated to this day. In the past, the National Federation of Physicians, in the name of the congress, telegraphed the government, urging it to promulgate them as soon as possible. However, those who spoke earnestly were ignored by those who listened. Is it because the government is busy with other matters and has no time for this? Or is it because there is a shortage of talent to formulate these regulations? If the regulations for physicians are not formulated effectively, then the rights of the medical community cannot be guaranteed. Although the government can treat this indifferently, it is an urgent matter for our medical community. I believe that many of the members of our association are practicing physicians in the country, and there are probably not a few who are well-versed in the law. Instead of sitting and watching the government delay and fail to promulgate this regulation for a long time, it is better for our association to gather this talent, collect this material, examine the established rules of various countries, and take into account the current situation in the country, and formulate a "Draft Regulations for Physicians," and then submit it to the government for adoption and implementation. Since it is based on the opinions of the majority, it can avoid the criticism of being contradictory and inappropriate, and the government can also achieve twice the result with half the effort. The formulation is by the association, and the promulgation is by the state, which seems to be different from overstepping one's authority. This is the second.</p>
<p>(3) Recommendation to Increase Internship Time in Medical Education: In the past, I had the recommendation of "hospitalization of schools" and "hospitalization of schools." The purpose of medical education is twofold: one is to cultivate advanced scholars, and the other is to produce treating physicians. In terms of academics, the former should not be taken lightly, but in terms of practicality, the latter is even more important. Practical science is different from those who only engage in empty talk, so academic experience and academic experience cannot be lacking, and experience is especially important. In recent years, there have been many medical schools in the country, but few of them meet the principles of medical education. Most ordinary medical schools do not have affiliated hospitals, and even if there are one or two with hospitals, the period for students to practice in the hospital mostly begins two or three years before graduation. It seems that such a short period of internship is difficult to achieve any effect. After graduation, when they come out into the world, there are many cases where they are unable to clarify their doubts during diagnosis. In my opinion, the internship time in the hospital should be extended to at least four or five years, so that the effect of emphasizing both theory and experience can be achieved, which is in line with the principles of medical education. The trial period is limited to the time of schooling, and after starting a practice, it can never have the slightest experimental nature. Our association pays extreme attention to the issue of medical education, and recently there has been the establishment of a committee to standardize the curriculum of medical schools. If we can focus on this purpose and extend the length of hospital internships, so that medical school students have sufficient experience in treating diseases after graduation, it may be of help to the future of medical education. This is the third.</p>
<p>(4) Compilation and Translation of Medical Books: In recent years, the government, considering the difficulty of purchasing foreign books and the need to promote the national language first, has issued a general order to all schools in the country, regardless of the type of science, that those who use foreign original texts as textbooks should all be replaced with Chinese texts. Only in medicine has it not been possible to achieve the effect of popularizing Chinese textbooks. This is because medicine is the most profound specialized science. If all textbooks are to be translated into Chinese, then it is necessary to engage in the translation of foreign books. Most of the medical translations published in the country are superficial. Therefore, the schools that use the original texts are still countless. Our association is aware of this, and has worked diligently on the compilation and translation of medical books in recent years. However, in my opinion, the scale is still too small. If we can expand its scope and, to the extent of our financial resources, employ specialized translators to engage in large-scale compilation and translation, then the results will certainly be amazing, and the benefits will be indescribable. The dispute among medical factions is due to the different languages and texts of foreign students. Now, if we translate the medical books of various countries into Chinese and set them as textbooks, then the languages and texts will be unified, and where will the differences of opinion come from? Moreover, the original books of Europe and the United States are of particularly high value, which is beyond the reach of poor families. If there are Chinese translations, then everyone can have one. For the association, it can also be associated with this great work and become immortal. Nothing is more important than the survival of the spirit. This is the fourth.</p>
<p>The achievements of the association in recent years are clear for all to see, and those who know them cannot but praise them. This is not only my "unbiased opinion." The above-mentioned points are just my humble opinions and one-sided views. Judging from the association's usual spirit of doing things, they should also be easy to do.</p>
<h3 id="e298">Preface to Physician Pang Jingzhou's Journey North Yu Yunxiu <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>Xu Shu Chong's "Shuowen Jiezi" says that sheep are in groups, dogs are alone, dogs get along and fight, so the word "group" follows sheep, and the word "alone" follows dog. I have often silently observed the Chinese people, who lack the virtue of being in groups and have more individualistic nature. In a country, whether it is a large government agency or a small alley, if three people form a crowd, there will be the problem of collusion and friction. At first, it involves things because of people, and then it goes against the public and becomes private. Therefore, since the Revolution of 1911, for more than twenty years, there has been chaos and turmoil, the country has not been established, and it has been shrinking by a hundred miles every day. This is the effect of being alone. Being in a group means being united, and being united means having strength. Strength is enough to shoulder great and difficult responsibilities. Being alone means being divided, and being divided means having weak strength. Weak strength means being unable to do anything. Scientific medicine in our country is just beginning to sprout, and its momentum has not been consolidated, and its strength has not been enhanced. Metaphysics hinders its progress, bad habits disturb its rear, the knowledgeable above destroy it, and the ignorant below slander it. Danger and doubt are intertwined, and obstacles are piled up. It is appropriate to unite rather than divide, and it is appropriate to be in groups rather than be alone. This is obvious. However, those who talk about medical factions in the world often say German, Japanese, English, and American. Although this is the talk of ordinary people, when it is actually examined, those who are involved use languages that do not communicate with each other, and the generation of divisions is naturally not surprising. It is not about having the view of superiors and subordinates. However, impetuous and frivolous sons use it to indulge in their mutual struggle, and eventually lead to separation and division, and develop into factions. They are eager for the small benefits of sharp knives and slow to consider the fundamental and overall plans. It cannot be said that they are not extremely foolish. Whenever I talk to Pang Jun about this, I cannot help but sigh and hate it. Last autumn, I also tried to find ways to communicate and unite with Niu Jun Huisheng and Xu Jun Naili. Before the plan was hidden, the matter failed to be completed, which is also what Pang Jun and I deeply regret. Investigating the reason for this, it is that over the years, there have been frequent instances of surpassing, but the sincerity of integration has not been fulfilled, which has led to this. Therefore, if you want medicine to be in a larger group, you must connect with sincerity and trust, support each other, reverse the previous mistakes, and it will not work. Pang Jun's journey north is to inspect schools above the professional level by order of the Ministry of Education. Pang Jun is in the wild, and his medicine is in Germany. He has been to England, France, the United States, and Japan, and has no partisan heart in his chest. Moreover, he hopes that medicine will be in a group, and he hopes that those who are alone. The Ministry of Education has many virtuous talents, and there are also many people who know medicine, but they only take Pang Jun, so what is their intention? Then, what I have been lamenting about, can I rely on it to make up for its regret? Pang Jun, please work hard to do it. Moreover, I have something more to say. It is inevitable that academics will have factions. Where there are factions, there will be struggles. However, if the struggle is in academics, then the research will inevitably be more diligent, and the exploration will inevitably be more precise. The progress of virtue and the cultivation of business both rely on struggle. If the struggle is in power and profit, then the jealousy will inevitably be more severe, and the exclusion will inevitably be more intense. The heart of changing, deceiving, and hating will be born with the struggle. It is to kindle its group. I think that the academics that have factions can still maintain their old habits. There is no need to change them, and there is nothing that can be unified. As for the administration of government affairs, it should be governed by the degree of equality and fairness, so that people can find a way to be effective in the country, and there is no fear of rumors and concealment. If they shift their competitive minds to academics and maintain their peaceful spirit in politics, then perhaps the struggle is not in gain, and their individuality can be in a group. I ask Pang Jun, what do you think? On his departure, I will take these words as a gift.</p>
<h3 id="e299">The Experience of Applying Analgesics <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>By Physician Li Qingchao</p>
<p>Nowadays, when it comes to analgesics, everyone praises morphine and salicylic acid for their strong and rapid pain-relieving effects. However, morphine has a strong narcotic effect, which can damage brain nerves and easily lead to addiction, even chronic poisoning. Salicylic acid, when used in large quantities, often causes adverse side effects, such as tinnitus, palpitations, and sweating. Thus, the patient's suffering is not relieved but rather precedes with unpleasant sensations. I often see ordinary people, when attacked by pain, either inject morphine or take opium, hoping for temporary relief, but disregarding the future dangers, eventually leading to deep poisoning and becoming incurable. Medicine is meant to treat people, but now it kills them instead. Is this the original intention of medical professionals in using drugs? Therefore, searching for an analgesic drug that has the special effects of morphine but without the drawbacks of addiction and brain damage is an urgent task for today's medical professionals and is also eagerly awaited by the masses!</p>
<p>Since the advent of "Veramon," pain sufferers who previously groaned in bed and tossed and turned in restlessness have been able to relieve their pain in a very short time. The speed of its analgesic effect is truly unbelievable. "Veramon" not only relieves the patient's pain but also provides the patient with considerable convenience: because this medicine only needs to be taken orally to show its effectiveness, there is no need to ask others to inject other dangerous analgesics.</p>
<p>We must know that localized pain can affect the health of the whole body. For example, a sore throat can make it difficult to swallow, and a toothache can make it impossible to chew, which can hinder nutrition and cause indigestion. Then, gastrointestinal diseases will follow, so how can we ignore it! "Veramon" can easily treat toothaches and sore throats caused by tooth decay and pharyngitis. Insomnia is also most likely to damage the mind because the cause of insomnia may be headaches, neuralgia, or earaches, etc., just as the saying goes, "If one meridian is not in harmony, the whole body is not comfortable." If "Veramon" can be used to relieve pain, you can naturally fall asleep peacefully. In this case, "Veramon" indirectly protects our health. Women experience an extra layer of pain due to their unique physiology, namely, pain during menstruation and labor pains during childbirth. I still remember a woman in labor who had severe labor pains but did not want an injection, so she was given "Veramon." As a result, the labor pains were greatly reduced, and the delivery was not affected in any way. In recent times, morphine and its derivatives have been abandoned for pain when suffering from diseases in the urethra because they can sometimes increase pain. If the dosage is slightly larger, it can easily cause unpleasant side effects such as vomiting or nausea. Therefore, the most appropriate method of pain relief at this time is to use "Veramon." For pain after surgery or bone fractures, gallstone, kidney stone pain, stomach pain, etc., no matter how severe, "Veramon" can immediately stop it, and its effect can last for several hours. This is something that other pain relievers cannot compare with!</p>

<p>Special Telecommunications Publication</p>
<p>The Essentials of the Telecommunications Industry</p>
<h3 id="e300">National Defense and Telecommunications <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Since our country has been subjected to active aggression by foreign forces, the whole country, from top to bottom, has gradually shifted its gaze to the borders and deeply feels that in this trend, without consolidating national defense, there is no way to establish a nation. The so-called gradual encroachment and division all start from the frontier and extend to the Central Plains. The importance of the border is definitely no less than that of the inner regions.</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, after the arduous struggle of the National Army, the war of resistance lasted for a month, and its achievements were remarkable. At that time, the unity of the people and the dedication of the soldiers were the main reasons for the victory, but transportation and communication equipment were also crucial. At critical moments, the staff did not hesitate to brave danger to establish contact, so the military authorities were able to调度指挥 and fully facilitated. International official communication also reached far and wide, winning deep sympathy. This kind of duty was originally what those who served in transportation should do, and there is no need to elaborate more. However, judging from this, we can see the importance of the relationship between national defense and telecommunications. Therefore, speaking of national defense today, if we consider it beyond our reach, we should first develop transportation, and in the development of transportation, the construction of roads and the communication of telecommunications are equally important.</p>
<p>Roads are not within the scope of this publication, so I will not discuss them for the time being. As for telecommunications in our country's northwest and southwest borders (the southeast coast focuses on coastal defense, but our country also has a northeast border, but it is pitiful to mention, as it has already created a puppet state), it can be divided into wired and wireless telecommunications. In terms of wired telecommunications, the line from Beijing via Zhangjiakou and Kulun to Buyantsogt (Kyakhta) is used to connect with Mongolia. The line from Lanzhou via Suzhou to Turpan is divided into two routes: one via Dihua to Yili and Khorgos, and the other via Yanqi to Kashi and Irkeshtam, both of which are used to connect with Xinjiang. The line to Qinghai goes from Lanzhou via Pingfan to Xining, and then connects with Huangyuan and Guide; the line to Xikang goes from Hanyuan in Sichuan Province to Kangding. In addition, the border of Yunnan Province goes from Tengyue via Xiaoxin Street to Bhamo in Burma, and from Hekou to Lao Cai in Annam. The border of Guangxi Province goes from Nanguan to Lang Son in Annam; the border of Guangdong Province goes from Dongxing to Hanoi in Annam. This is the general situation. In terms of wireless telecommunications, Yunnan and Xinjiang have radio stations. Other places such as Tibet, Mongolia, and Qinghai still lack additional installations. Judging from this, the communication related to national defense should be vigorously developed in line with the needs; otherwise, if there are many troubles in the border areas and news is delayed, how can we cope with them with ease?</p>
<p>Developing the Northwest and consolidating national defense requires this determination. Looking at the newspapers, the central leaders have successively disregarded fatigue, traveled to the border areas, and conducted on-the-spot investigations, so future achievements will definitely be considerable. However, in terms of telecommunications alone, given the vast territory of our country and the length of the borders, the cost of laying wired telecommunications is high and the project is huge. Wireless radio stations can be regarded as a communication tool, and it seems appropriate to start with their construction first. However, the establishment of radio stations in the border areas also requires a lot of money. Given the current shortage of telecommunications funds, how can it be done quickly? It is heard that the initial plan of the Ministry of Communications has been implemented to increase equipment in Lanzhou as a western communication center and to establish radio stations in Suiyuan, Zhangjiakou, and other places to connect with various places in the southeast. This measure will provide considerable convenience for communication in the Northwest, but it cannot be said that this construction alone is satisfactory. It is believed that the development of the Northwest border areas concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood. The development of water conservancy and farmland, the planning of roads and transportation, all require funds. A comprehensive plan should be formulated, and a portion of the funds should be designated for the equipment of communication. In this way, once the foundation is laid, success can be expected. As for the fact that the Northwest region is vast and sparsely populated, desolate and undeveloped, and people in the interior consider it a long journey, it is heard that the Ministry of Communications has already formulated reward regulations, and all personnel who go to work in the border areas will be given preferential treatment beyond the norm. This shows that the Ministry of Communications pays attention to border communication and has a predetermined overall plan. It is hoped that the whole country will cooperate and actively participate. It must be known that developing border transportation and exploiting Northwest resources is also a way to consolidate the national defense gateway. Looking forward to the future of our country, this is indeed the urgent task at present.</p>
<h3 id="e301">The True Meaning of Telegraph Price Reduction <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Yi</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Communications stipulated that "the name and address of the recipient of each telegram, up to 15 characters, will be calculated as 5 characters." For the sender, the savings seem to be very little; but for the Ministry of Communications, the resulting loss is quite considerable.</p>
<p>Originally, the price of telegrams in China was much more expensive than in Western countries. Because it was too expensive, the general public would not send a telegram unless they encountered extremely important matters. The communications authorities understood this, so they wanted to try their best to reduce the price. However, in this period of extreme shortage of telecommunications finances, if the price of telegrams were reduced to the same level as in Western countries, it would simply be impossible to maintain it. In desperation, they came up with this alternative solution: reduce the cost of the recipient's name and address. Although it cannot meet the hopes of the general public, it is much more convenient than before!</p>
<p>The telecommunications industry (including wired telegraph, wireless telegraph, city telephone, long-distance telephone, and wireless telephone, etc.) has a very close and important relationship with a country's politics, military affairs, culture, education, economy, finance, and all industries and commerce; and its principle is nothing more than facilitating the people. Therefore, this kind of business is run by the state, unlike ordinary industries and commerce, which are solely for the purpose of making profits. Even if there are times when it loses money, it must still be operated as usual. However, in Western countries, the government subsidizes this kind of business from the national treasury every year, only seeking the development of the business and achieving the purpose of facilitating the people; it does not need to haggle over every penny. Therefore, the competent authorities can feel at ease to engage in it and strive for development; even if the price of telegrams is lower, it will certainly not affect the business itself. At the same time, on the other hand, once the price of telegrams is lower, the public will naturally be happy to use them; sending a telegram is almost the same as the cost of sending an express letter, and the speed of telegram transmission is much faster than that of letters. In this way, the use of telegrams will naturally be widespread; since the use of telegrams is widespread, the telegraph business will naturally develop; since the telegraph business has developed, even though the price of telegrams is low, the losses can naturally be compensated.</p>
<p>However, our government has never subsidized the telecommunications industry. Not only has there been no subsidy, but in the past era of warlords, they arbitrarily appointed bureau chiefs, exploited telecommunications funds, and regarded the telecommunications bureau as a tax revenue agency, and the pain still lingers! Even now, the official military telephone bills owed by military and political organs are no less than more than three million yuan per year. According to the statistics of national telecommunications revenue and expenditure, there is a surplus every year; in reality, there is a deficit every year. This deficit is affected by the official military telephone arrears. In recent years, due to bandit disasters and wars, the original lines have been severely damaged; and telecommunications funding is very exhausted. Not only is it impossible to expand telecommunications construction, but it is already extremely difficult to maintain the original business!</p>
<p>Not long ago, telecommunications colleagues, due to the shortage of telecommunications funds, in order to maintain the status quo, once had a proposal to increase the price of telegrams. The reasons are as follows: Postal rates have already increased from three cents and four cents to five cents; train ticket prices have also increased much more than before. Postal services, railways, and telecommunications all belong to the transportation industry; moreover, postal rates will never be subject to arrears from military and political organs; although railways are sometimes affected by free tickets, the losses will certainly not be as much as telephone bills. Postal rates and train ticket prices can still be increased, so why can't the price of telegrams be increased? However, after repeated consideration by the Ministry of Communications, not only was the proposal to increase prices not adopted, but ways were also found to reduce them. The motivation is nothing more than to make the general public feel the interest in sending telegrams, so that they will not regard telegrams as "inauspicious objects" as before. This plight should be seen by all Chinese people!</p>
<p>This method of the Ministry of Communications is really a helpless measure due to the shortage of telecommunications funds. If the domestic politics is on the right track and the arrears of official military telegrams are properly resolved, the price of telegrams will definitely be gradually reduced. We know that the current telegraph bureau is no longer like the yamen of the past! The personnel working in the telegraph bureau are no longer like the bureaucrats of the past! The speed of telegram transmission and the accuracy of the text have also improved much more than before! Sending a telegram can indeed get the benefit of a telegram, and it will never be like the telegrams of the past, which were sometimes slower than letters. If everyone can feel the interest in sending telegrams and everyone can make full use of telegrams, then the telecommunications business will naturally flourish, and the industry and commerce will gradually prosper! This is the true meaning of the telegraph price reduction!</p>
<h3 id="e302">Telecommunications Miscellany丨Telephone丨Automatic <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>

<p>Calling it "It Says Through" is Really "Not Through"</p>
<p>Those who use automatic telephones pick up the receiver, hold it to their ear, and at the same time use their hand to dial the number they want to call. The previous article mentioned something called "Reachable and Through," the sound of which, like machinery, is considered to mean that it can be reached; however, sometimes after hearing the sound of "Reachable and Through," perhaps after dialing, there will be "Hatred, Hatred," intermittent and melodious, buzzing. The sound of "Hatred, Hatred" undoubtedly expresses a kind of regret. "Hatred, Hatred" is technically called "Busy Tone." "Busy Tone" is really not through! Why is it through but not through? The "Hatred, Hatred" sound emitted by the machinery is exactly like notifying the user there, that is, "The user you want to call is busy talking to someone else and must wait a while before you can reach them."</p>
<p>From this, before an automatic telephone call is made, you always hear a through sound (the sound of machinery). The sound of the through is not the same, and whether the telephone can be connected or not is also distinguished by hearing a "Reachable and Through" or "Busy Tone." (Shared telephone also has "Busy Tone," so the operator can avoid saying "Line is busy.")</p>
<p>As for how the machinery in the telephone局内 emits the sound of "Hatred, Hatred," this should also be what ordinary people who do not understand the situation of automatic telephone wiring want to know. In short, (detailed wiring will be discussed later) automatic telephone machines, depending on the user's own dialing, the machinery in the局内 responds and acts. As for dialing wiring, after the user dials an Arabic numeral, the machinery immediately selects an idle line from the lines belonging to this group and connects it to the second group. When the second number is dialed, the machinery also selects an empty line, so as to connect it to the third group. In this way, it is pushed forward layer by layer to connect to the required user. If the empty lines in a group have already been completely occupied by the user, or the user being called has already been connected and is talking to someone else, then the machinery used to select, in one transfer, is not connected to the busy line, but is connected to other machinery. Through the action of this machinery, it emits a special sound wave, so that those who dial the phone at this time hear the sound of hatred...hatred...unceasingly. (The sound of hatred, hatred can be stopped, just put down the receiver.)</p>
<p>According to Telephone丨Automatic, the first article was published in the second issue and was temporarily suspended due to the crowding of manuscripts. It is not that it will not be continued. This is specially attached to answer those who ask. In the future, as long as the position allows, I will continue to write.</p>
<h3 id="e303">European Telephone Paradise丨Sweden <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xianding</p>
<p>Using the Telephone丨Novel Method</p>
<p>Europeans often call Sweden the telephone paradise. The Swedish Iron Industry and Commerce Association recently wanted to hold an executive committee meeting using the telephone. The meeting had a total of six representatives. In addition to the chairman residing in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, the other five people lived in various cities. Some of the cities are up to 500 miles apart. According to the ordinary method, they must gather in the capital, which takes many days. Now they can use the telephone to discuss 会务. During the discussion, each representative can hear the arguments of the other representatives and can speak in turn. It saves time and reduces costs. The method is quite novel and practical. According to Mr. Neom, the chairman of the association, "When the meeting is held, the discussion is the same as sitting around the table." Its convenience can also be imagined.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hult, an engineer at the Swedish capital telephone局, who implemented this plan, the plan has been successful in theory. Once the tests are completed, the procedures for preparation can be simplified a lot. The stipulated method is as follows: Before the meeting, you must first contact the capital telephone局 to settle everything. There are no restrictions on call time on Sundays and holidays. On other days, it is stipulated that the limit is 15 points. The call fee for each participating representative is slightly higher than the ordinary long-distance call fee. However, the call fee between the Swedish capital and major cities is US$0.26 (equivalent to 7 角 8 分 in Chinese currency) every three minutes during peak hours. Fifteen minutes is only US$1.30 (equivalent to 3 元 9 角 in Chinese currency), which is not too expensive. Moreover, you can enjoy half price before 9:00 am and after 6:00 pm. If the distance is shorter, the call fee is also relatively reduced. From the Swedish capital to Lapland in the far north, the journey is about 900 miles, and the call fee every three minutes is only US$0.65 during the day and US$0.30 at night.</p>
<p>Sweden's novel use of telephones is not limited to "telephone meetings." If telephone users in the Swedish capital are unable to answer the phone in person due to going out for business, whether it is for a few hours or a few weeks, they can request the局 to connect all calls to a dedicated telephone operator, record the numbers of all calling users one by one, and, if necessary, instruct them to answer the phone on their behalf. When the user returns home, they can receive a list of the calling user numbers and the communication records of the phone calls that were answered on their behalf. The fee is also very low, only US$0.025 per call.</p>
<h3 id="e304">The Understanding that the Social Community Should Have of International Wireless Radio Stations (Part 2) <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Tianzuo</p>
<p>Speaking of Diplomacy</p>
<p>In conducting diplomacy, countries, in addition to negotiating and competing at the table, also use telecommunications to achieve publicity effects as a diplomatic tool. It goes without saying that they use international telecommunications to exchange information with foreign embassies and consulates; they also use international telecommunications to stir up international public opinion and shift the world's attention to achieve diplomatic success. I still remember that during the Washington Conference, the Shandong issue became the focus of the conference. The debate was unprecedentedly fierce. The whole nation paid attention, and their joys, sorrows, and emotions all depended on information; and appeals and petitions, as diplomatic support, also relied on telecommunications. Fortunately, at that time, the American Pacific Water Line Telegraph Company was able to quickly transmit this telegram, so that information was agile and the situation could be dealt with properly. International communication's convenience to our country was also a powerful force in achieving some results at the Washington Conference. If the conference were not in the United States at that time, and international communication was not autonomous and was controlled by others, the result would be even worse, as expected. Now that the international station has been established, there is no need to worry about others strangling our throats. This is how the international station is related to our country's diplomacy.</p>
<p>Speaking of Military Affairs</p>
<p>When international wars occur, a country's international communication agency is the target that the enemy country wants to destroy first. The right to use international submarine cable communication in our country is entirely in the hands of foreigners. Once something happens, this traffic tool will not be used for our benefit, and we will not be able to contact our allies in a unified manner, and we will inevitably become a major flaw in the international war barrier! Even if there is superior international submarine cable communication, it is still useless without a strong naval force to protect it. Because submarine cables are laid on the seabed, stretching for thousands of miles, separated by oceans, and difficult to protect, it is wise to build an international station as a national defense communication agency under the current state of our country's weak naval power. Because it does not occupy a large area, military defense is easier to implement. Now that the international station has been established, as long as there is a considerable air force to protect it, there is no need to worry about the interruption of international communication when international wars break out. This is how the international station is related to our country's national defense.</p>
<p>The relationship between the international radio station and our country's economy, diplomacy, and military affairs is as described above. What is the result of its business? This should be said urgently. The most important conditions for the transmission of telecommunications are speed and accuracy. The machinery used by the station all uses the latest high-speed automatic transmitting and receiving machines. Transmitting and receiving telegrams are all done by machines, not by manual labor, so its maximum speed can reach about 300 characters per minute. As for direct lines, it can reach New York and London, the financial centers of the world, as well as major cities such as San Francisco, Paris, Berlin, Geneva, Moscow, Manila, Java, Saigon, and Hong Kong. The fastest transmission time per message is only one minute. In terms of accuracy of transmission and reception, the station has assigned specialists to carefully proofread incoming and outgoing plain and encrypted telegrams. Therefore, in the past three years, the station has transmitted and received more than 10 million characters of telegrams, of which only more than 10,000 characters were wrong, with an average error of only 1/10,000. The reason is that the station colleagues deeply know that most international telegrams are related to business information. A delay of one second or an error of one word is crucial to business gains and losses, and the input and output are extremely large, so they are all careful and sensitive. As a result of the station's hard work and progress in the past three years, the business situation has developed day by day. Now domestic and foreign financial institutions, import and export merchants, news agencies, and embassies and consulates of various countries in China are competing to have their international telegrams transmitted by the station, which shows the public's firm belief in the station, and the station's increasing business is not accidental.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the decline of our country's international status is an undeniable fact, but to improve our international status, we must work together consistently to show something. In the past, when international communication agencies had not been established, we had to endure the pain of allowing the overflow of rights and interests when communicating with overseas messages. Now the international radio station has autonomous rights, and its relationship with military affairs, diplomacy, etc. is as described above, and its business performance can also be so rapidly improved. If people in society send international telegrams and abandon the autonomous international radio station, how can patriots bear to do this? I dare to tell you frankly, in order to seek the public's understanding of the station, and to encourage the station to make further efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e305">The Establishment of Wired Telegraph Lines in the Past Year (Part 2) <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Jiaguang</p>
<p>Lines in Progress</p>
<p>(1) Explanation: The above are all about the reorganization and expansion of lines that were completely completed within the past year; in fact, the Ministry of Communications has done more than this. Some projects were initiated in the past year, and the construction is underway, and it will take time to complete the work. It is not listed above, and it should be supplemented and recorded to show the reality.</p>
<p>(2) Statistics: Most of the line projects in progress can be completed in the spring of this year. According to its nature, it can be divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>(甲) Repair: Repair and replace poles and lines on the original lines. This method has been described above.</p>
<p>(乙) Reconstruction: That is, the original lines are not good, and they are demolished and rebuilt to make them practical. The project is larger than the repair.</p>
<p>(丙) Addition: The addition can be divided into two types: lines and lines. It has been explained before, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>Now, I will count the main and branch lines separately according to the above three items; the distance in kilometers is currently omitted.</p>
<p>(1) Main Lines</p>
<p>甲、Those under repair: Nanjing to Zhenjiang Hangzhou to Quzhou Quzhou to Jianning Guangdong to Luohe Dakou to Jining Tengxian</p>
<p>乙、Those under reconstruction: Tianjin to Beijing</p>
<p>(2) Branch Lines</p>
<p>甲、Those under repair: Yushan to Guangxin Anren to Guangxin Luoyang to Tongguan Hangzhou to Changxing Funing to Donggou</p>
<p>乙、Those under reconstruction: Nanchang to Jiujiang</p>
<p>(3) Newly Established Lines</p>
<p>甲、Lines added: Tuzhou to Pingyang Longquan to Lishui Yunhe to Taishun Qingyuan to Songxi Songxi to Jianning Jinxi to Zixi Zixi to Guangze Xiaoshi to Lichuan</p>
<p>乙、Lines added: Hangzhou to Quzhou Quzhou to Jiangshan</p>
<p>Prospects for the Future</p>
<p>Looking at the above records, we can know the efforts of the Ministry of Communications in the establishment of lines in the past year. Although the wired telecommunications industry has done its best to maintain it, it is still smooth, but if it is not rectified, it may become more unmanageable in a few years. Observe the needs of the times, make fundamental repairs, and expand the essentials; to make it perfect, the main and branch roads are like trees that can be seen to flourish day by day; however, according to people in the communication industry, the funding is quite difficult to raise. Compared with the total number of lines in the country, the lines repaired last year are less than one-tenth of them. The plan should be practical and the cost should be saved as much as possible. With this achievement, it is not easy. The reporter wrote this and deeply hopes that the authorities will continue to work hard so that what can be recorded this year will be better than in previous years.</p>

<p>American Wireless Facsimile Telegraph</p>
<p>An American wireless company, recently approved by the Washington Federal Radio Commission, is launching ultra-shortwave facsimile wireless communication between New York and Philadelphia. The equipment for this communication is currently being rushed into production. After these two locations are connected, the business will be expanded to Chicago, Washington, Boston, New Orleans, San Francisco, and other major cities. Photos and letters can be transmitted and received using radio waves as long as five meters. Moreover, specially made multiplex equipment can be used to send three telegrams simultaneously on one wavelength, with a maximum speed of 180 words per minute. The telegram charges will be calculated based on the size of the image or letter. The price will be lower than ordinary telegram rates. The aforementioned ultra-shortwave radio stations planned for these locations are scheduled to open for communication in June of this year. At that time, it is also planned to connect with the company's international wireless circuits to send and receive international telegrams.</p>

Although parcel post was 151,666,000 items in 1932-33, less than 158,100,000 items in 1931-32, it has shown an upward trend since March 1933. Significant increases between 1913-14 and 1932-33 are as follows: Telephone calls increased from 834,000,000 to 1,490,000,000. Telephone exchanges increased from 2,900 to 5,300. Unemployment insurance increased from £1,560,000 to £36,180,000. Letters increased from 5,783,700,000 to 6,640,000,000. However, domestic telegrams decreased from 75,618,000 to 36,041,000.

<p>Dispatching of Telegraph Lines</p>
<p>The dispatching of wired telegraph lines is closely related to the speed of telegraph services. If the lines are dispatched properly, the telegraph services can be exceptionally fast. Recently, the Ministry of Communications has been dispatching telegraph lines in various provinces based on the local telegraph service conditions. The important ones are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai Qingjiangpu has been using the Western Union telegraph machine for direct communication since March 22nd. After that, telegrams between Jiangbei and the Shanghai-Hangzhou area should be particularly fast.</p>
<p>(2) The direct Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou) telegraph circuit was interrupted for several years due to the telegraph wires between Shunde and Zhangde being destroyed by the military during the war. The Ministry of Communications has now completed the repair of the wires between the two places and ordered the Pinghan bureaus to restore direct communication.</p>
<p>(3) Telegrams between North China, Central China, and South China used to be relayed through the direct Jiujiang-Guangzhou circuit, which was quite fast. However, since the Communists occupied Gan province, the direct Jiujiang-Guangzhou line has been blocked. In order to provide relief, the Ministry of Communications has ordered Hengzhou, Hunan, and Guangzhou to open direct communication. At the same time, additional wires will be installed between Changsha and Hengzhou to open direct Yuehan (Guangdong-Hankou) communication.</p>
<p>(4) Telegrams between Shanghai and Jiaxing and Jiashan used to be relayed through Suzhou. Now, direct communication has been established since March 19th.</p>
<p>(5) There are many telegrams between Tunxi, Anhui, and Shanghai. However, they currently have to be relayed through the Wuhu and Nanjing bureaus. In order to expedite telegrams between Tunxi and Shanghai, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Wuhu Bureau and the Shanghai Bureau to communicate directly, so that it is not necessary to relay through Nanjing.</p>

<p>Major city telegram bureaus and telegraph offices often receive more than 1,000 telegrams per day. Therefore, each messenger usually carries four or five telegrams to deliver in sequence. This not only wastes the messenger's time waiting in the bureau, but also delays the delivery of the last telegram. In order to provide relief, the Ministry of Communications has ordered busy bureaus and offices to dispatch messengers to deliver telegrams as soon as they arrive, with the principle of messengers carrying fewer telegrams and returning to the bureau early. At the same time, more messengers will be added to gradually change to one messenger per telegram delivery, so that incoming telegrams can be exceptionally fast and not delayed at all.</p>

<h3 id="e311">The Municipal Election Issues We Should Pay Attention To <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Pu</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council election of the Public Concession has recently concluded, and the representatives elected by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association's Citizens' Group were also announced a few days ago. Amidst the election voices of both the Chinese and foreign sides, two phenomena have been discovered. The reporter believes that these two phenomena are worthy of in-depth discussion, and they are first raised in this issue, and then studied in detail in subsequent issues. How to promote and advance the basic issues related to municipal progress and the cultivation of preliminary civil rights is something that all citizens and party and government authorities in this city should pay close attention to.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the first phenomenon, before the foreign directors of the Municipal Council were produced, Mr. A. W. Beanmont, the editor of the English "Minle Weekly," published an article criticizing the Municipal Council election, saying that the Shanghai municipality was controlled by a certain underlying force. The reporter has not yet found Mr. Beanmont's original text, but according to the general idea recorded in various newspapers, Mr. Beanmont's statement is shocking, but it is true. Mr. Beanmont believes that "...... because he witnessed that the corruption of the Shanghai Public Concession municipality is absolutely incomparable to the municipal progress of major cities in the world, this reason is due to the lack of municipal progress thinking of Shanghai citizens, but the municipal power has always been controlled by a certain underlying force, such as the re-election of the Municipal Council directors every session, often the candidates are designated by a certain underlying force, and their names have already been drafted, so the voting of citizens is just a formality. Therefore, the so-called Municipal Council directors are ultimately nothing more than directors or managers of major foreign banks, figures in the pockets of wealthy Jewish merchants...... Because they are all important members of a certain association and claim to be a special class in the concession, so people say that the production of Municipal Council directors comes from association elections rather than city elections, which is indeed true......" Whether his words are groundless is really worth studying.</p>
<p>(2) The second phenomenon is that the Chinese Ratepayers' Association represents the will of Shanghai citizens and is an agency for the welfare of Shanghai citizens. Shanghai citizens should pay very close attention to the election of the Ratepayers' Association. However, according to newspaper records, the number of people with the right to be elected in this Chinese election was more than 3,000, and the number of people with the right to vote should be several times or even dozens of times greater than this number. However, the result was that only more than 2,000 votes were cast. This phenomenon not only shows the weakness of the general public's municipal concept, believing that the quality of the municipality cannot be controlled by themselves, but also the indifference to elections is even more significant.</p>
<p>Speaking of the content of these two phenomena, regarding Mr. Beanmont's belief that the biggest reason for the corruption of the concession municipality is the control of a certain underlying force, and that the "lack of preliminary civil rights thinking" of citizens is secondary, the reporter's opinion is different from Mr. Beanmont's. Because we know that the corruption of the municipality is indeed due to the control of a small number of "special classes," but why can a small number of special classes control it? Then we have to blame the Shanghai citizens' neglect of elections. If every citizen with the right to vote in Shanghai can actively participate in the election and pay close attention to the candidates, how can a small number of special classes still manipulate it? Therefore, the reporter believes that the only important reason why a small number of special classes can control it is that citizens do not take the municipality seriously, and even less take the election seriously. Under this circumstance, it is not easy to eradicate a certain underlying force.</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of our own side, it is not only that the above-mentioned indifference is even worse than that of Westerners, but also the fear of foreigners is even more obvious. Because the concession has always been managed by Westerners, the general public has long believed that they have no right to interfere, and also believe that Chinese directors are just a formality and have no real power. Little do they know that one aspect of our country's being invaded by foreign countries is indeed the inevitable demand of imperialists, and our own self-abandonment, weakness, and incompetence, which have enabled foreigners to make progress, is also a great reason. Therefore, one of the biggest reasons for the lack of progress in the concession municipality can also be said to be that our citizens do not pay enough attention to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the election of representatives, and cannot do their best to support the Chinese directors. Therefore, although the Chinese directors have always been outstanding members of society, their contributions are still limited, and they cannot do their best to seek welfare for our citizens, and cannot do their best to fight against foreigners. Directors must be constantly encouraged by citizens and do their best to support them, so that they dare to do things boldly. Now that the majority of citizens are indifferent to the directors, they have no power to do things, cannot be valued by foreigners, and naturally cannot talk about the courage to resist.</p>
<p>In short, if we want politics to be on the right track, the people must truly be able to supervise politics and participate in politics; if we want the people's participation in politics to be thoroughly realized, we must first be able to actively promote, cultivate, and implement the preliminary work of civil rights with one heart and one mind from top to bottom. Looking at the election situation of both the Chinese and foreign sides this time, what is most touching is that Westerners who are familiar with democratic politics, and Shanghai citizens who have gained more new ideas, still have such a weak understanding of elections. From this, we can imagine the civil governance ideas in the inland provinces of our country.</p>
<p>Today, people in the government often make grand pronouncements about democratic politics. We sincerely do not know how to start democratic politics in this current situation, and how much promotion and cultivation work the promoters of democratic politics have actually done. This is an associated feeling that we must have when we begin to discuss the Shanghai issue!</p>

<p>"Old X! These houses here really look unreliable!" It was a bright morning, and the residents of XX Alley were all discussing this in whispers.</p>
<p>The truth is this: The houses in XX Alley have been around for twenty years. Although the exterior doesn't look very old, the interior at least presents an old appearance: the roof beams are a bit skewed, and the floors are a bit rugged.</p>
<p>The news of "rebuilding" had been spreading throughout the alley for two or three days, but because it was unofficial, it was just suspicious speculation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a message came from a restaurant at the entrance of the alley, saying that the landlord had definitely decided to demolish the houses here. The reason why it could attract the attention of everyone in the alley was because the small boss of the restaurant was a close friend of the landlord. Today, the situation has completely changed. All you can see in the alley are piles of people discussing it widely. It seems that the situation is much more tense.</p>
<p>Finally, one hour after the meal, the landlord's notice was announced. This undoubtedly caused panic and astonishment among everyone in the alley. Involuntarily, everyone in the alley lost their courage, and all the previous discussions disappeared.</p>
<p>At first, an old gentleman from a cigarette paper shop initiated a union. He first discussed it with the hotel owner next door and settled on it as a temporary meeting place, and then found an old distillery owner to help. Then, they began to proceed.</p>
<p>A union needs to gather talents, so their first step was to contact the tenants. The stores in the front have successively received their notification, but the rows of residences inside are not within their sphere of influence. Contacting them is not as easy as they thought, but they have to contact them.</p>
<p>Among the rows of residences inside, the more reputable ones can be considered the elementary school principal and a veteran and capable Mr. Zhu. Because they are both intellectuals, people's faith and worship of them can be easily grasped.</p>
<p>Of course! In order to consolidate the union, these two pillars are indispensable. Therefore, they are responsible for the work in the residential area.</p>
<p>Around six o'clock in the afternoon on the first day, the union was established in such a vague manner. The hotel-style auditorium was crowded with the giants of each family, all showing a bitter face that was neither crying nor laughing. In fact, at this time, there was nothing to laugh at.</p>
<p>Each family has its own situation, and each person has his own difficulties. After this small group was produced, who doesn't want to complain? Needless to say, this small auditorium has already become quite deafening.</p>
<p>"Everyone! The reason why we are meeting here today is just to gather our strength to resist the landlord's "rebuilding and demolition" this time. But a snake cannot walk without a head. We must find a</p>
