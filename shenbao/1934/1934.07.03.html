<p>在中央紀念週</p>
<p>（南京）汪院長中中央黨部紀念週報告云、昨日爲七月一日、是國民政府成立的紀念日、也是此次全國財政會議議决案中最重部份開始實行之日、記得今年三月十二日總理逝世紀念日、兄弟在中央黨部報告、叙及廢除苛細雜捐先從江西做起、江西的苛細雜捐、每月約二十五萬、其最大用途、爲敎育經費及保衛經費、行政院因爲江西是剿匪重要省份、所以議决由財政部每月撥二十五萬元、以爲江西免除苛細雜捐之抵償、從三月起實行、當時兄弟並且聲明、免除苛細雜捐、因由江西做起、惟盼望於最短期間、普及全國、財政部孔部長亦同此意、所以召集全國財政會議、解决中央地方財政問題、其最重要的部份、便是减輕田賦附加及、免除苛細雜捐、這些都是地方收入、中央不能空口說减輕及免除、必須有抵補的辦法、才能見之實行减輕田賦附加抵補案、巳由財政部呈奉行政院通過、並巳將烟酒牌稅、自七月一日起、全數撥歸地方、印花稅收入、亦巳確定統收分撥辦法、自下年度起、凖備以一成歸省、三成歸縣、二成補助邊遠貧瘠省分、廢除苛細雜捐案亦巳由財政部根據全國財政會議議决、呈奉行政院、呈請國民政府明令限期於七月一日開始廢除、所以今年的七月一日、在改良稅率减輕人民負擔、是有深遠的意義的、財政部孔部長在財政會議以前、親赴皖贛湘鄂、實地視察地方財政狀况、近來更不避溽暑、親赴魯冀豫晋平津一帶實地視察、這種勇猛實行的决心、是値得十分欽佩的、至於各省、奉行全國財政會議議决的决心、也十分値得欽佩、因爲全國財政會議議决、對於苛細雜捐、規定以今年七月一日起、至十二月底止、爲分别實行廢除時期、所以自全國財政會議閉會後、各省代衰紛紛回省、報告省政府、立刻着手進行、如江蘇省於六月十日卽咨報財政部將各縣地方雜捐最苛細者、四十二種卽行廢除、並不等至七月一日、行政院巳明令嘉獎、以爲模範、又如湖北省於六月二十八日咨報財政部將舊有雜捐二十七種、着手裁廢、定於七月一日實行、如江西省於六月二十五日咨報財政部將本省輸出物品之産捐、提前撤消、自七月一日起實行、此後本省各項生産物品、一槪免徵産捐、以解除人民痛苦、如浙江省、於六月二十九日咨報財政部、地方苛細雜捐巳擬定裁免者、總計二百八十餘種、其他各省亦陸續報告前來、對於第一批的廢除工作、如此迅速、則第二批以次、可推想而知了、於此有一點重要意義、要提出報告的、因爲廢除苛細雜捐、不僅在消極上减輕人民負担、而且在積極上發展民力、充實國力、有人以爲政府旣然要做救亡圖存的共作、正應該集中人民力量、積極建設、不應該從减輕人民負担着想、以致一切計劃均無從進行、殊不知現在中國人民、己經困窮達於極點、若不加以培護、將無復負担租稅的能力了、中國人民百分之八十以上、都是農民、這是大家都知道的、而中國所有財政收入、其大部份都是從農民身上榨取得來、田賦附加取之農民所不待言、卽苛細雜捐、其大部份亦是取之農民、關於江蘇省各縣先行廢除地方雜捐表、湖北各商埠稅捐裁廢表、浙江省議定裁免各種苛細雜捐簡明表、財政部不日公佈、各位一看、便知其詳、所以苛細雜捐的廢除、以之减輕農民負担、卽以之恢復農民生産能力、農民生産能力如果能恢復健康、卽民力自然發展、國力亦自然隨而充實了、財政部不但努力於减輕田賦附加、廢除苛細雜捐、並且獎勵農産出口、分别减稅或免稅、巳經由行政院議决、呈請中央政治會議核定、送立法院審議通過了、</p>

<p>最近財政部和鐵道部的努力工作、其有益於農民、毫無疑義、只是在國家危急存亡的時候、要求加重人民負担、以作種種救亡圖存的建設、也是毫無疑義的、然則這些建設費用、靠誰負担呢、减輕農民負担、以恢復其生産能力、誠然是發展民力恢復國力的要素、但是否有緩不濟急之虞呢、有好些同志、因爲顧慮到這些問題、所以汲汲於舉借外債、本來吸收外資、興辦實業、其性質與政治借債全然不同、總理在實業計劃曾經明白指出、種種必要的方法與條件、但是我們如想舉借外債、必須先明白一個道理、卽是若要舉借新債、必需整理舊債、如果舊債不能整理、則政府對外没有信用、有誰來借新債與你、所以現在行政院接連舉行了幾次整理債務的會議、并責成財政部與其他有關係各部、根據議决原則、詳細計劃、財政部本有整理内外債委員會、現在正加緊工作、至於鐵道部三年以來、整理路債、在困苦艱難中、不斷努力、巳經將路債價格、逐漸提高、今試將二十一年一月份與二十三年四月份中國鐵路公債在國外市價各種高低比較表列出如左、</p>

<h3 id="c14">日本政局變動敬 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>日本齋藤内閣。近以黑田前財次受賄案之牽累。將不能出於總辭職一途。夫現内閣固自命爲克服非常局面之超然内閣者也。然卽以其外交技術而論。在過去二年之所謂「非常時」中。無論對華對美。不僅不足圖暫時之苟安。且處處仰軍閥之鼻息。以催促新危機之降臨如察東之增兵也。灤東之盤踞也。藏本事件之鋪張揚厲也。海軍談判之堅持成見也。廉價商品之積極傾銷也。無一而非借故挑釁。加深「非常時」之嚴重性。齋藤内閣在軍閥卵翼下之外交政績。如是而己。謂其後繼之人獨能自由恢復國際常道關係。其可信耶。</p>
<p>吾人試細察日本政治之傳統。卽可瞭然於此次政局變動與遠東和平前途之關係。第一日本歷届内閣比較接近民主精神者。厥爲世界戰爭後之原敬内閣。餘者則莫不深染軍閥官僚之色彩。九一八事變以來。其依附於軍閥之趨勢。尤爲急進。若槻犬養雖號稱政黨政閣實則一般受制於軍部。犬養氏且以現任首相而爲現役軍人所狙擊。通日本國内。竟無人敢作擁護憲政尊嚴之主張。由此可見日本政黨政治之懦弱與夫軍閥政治之强横。第二日本之大陸政策。旣己第實施。同時海權擴張運動。尤盛極一時。聞其明年度之海軍豫算案。將超過五萬萬圓日金以上。海陸軍航空隊。本年十二月後。亦將全部更換新機。以應付其所謂一九三六年之危機第三日本外交。歷來充分表現其二重性格。而於遠東方面尤爲明顯。其駐外之公使領事。僅爲點綴門面之交際人物。而陸海部又有其特定方針者在。如芳澤在歐洲標榜和平之日。卽爲日軍在東北恣意侵略之時。此種二重性格。今後必仍繼續。可無疑義。第四。日本官僚己日益腐化。以致失去人民之信仰。政黨以財閥爲靠山。而財閥則多投降於軍部。軍部中人乃得借舉國一致之美名。以助成軍國主義之發展。</p>
<p>觀此四端。則知無論繼齋藤而起者爲何如人。要皆不能倖免軍部勢力之控制。據陸軍方面之意見。後繼内閣之首要條件。須不作特權階級之傀儡。是卽謂後繼内閣須僅爲軍部之傀儡也。明乎此。而後可以討論日本下届閣揆之人選。聞後繼閣揆以淸浦奎吾氏之呼聲爲最高。淸浦號稱中立。而年事過高。卽令出而組閣。殆仍不免爲齋藤之流亞。次之則爲近衛文磨。氏爲日本貴族中深負時望之逸才。元老方面。旣多好感。與軍部之關係。尤爲深切。一旦近衛内閣成立。實際視之爲軍部内閣。實無不可。平沼騏一郎爲荒木系之優秀政治家。近乃爲元老所抑制。如不得軍部方面之熱烈援助。恐難有上臺之可能。然而果至登臺。則荒木政權之變相耳。再則如宇垣一成。爲民政黨所擁戴。政友會所贊同。在軍人中亦有一部分之羽翼。且屬於接近立憲政治之人。但爲軍部中層將領所反對。是以諒解殊難。組閣之實在性。殆甚微也。其餘如鈴木。如若槻。依照憲政政治之常規。固皆有組閣之望。然日本今日之政黨政治。逐漸式微。政黨内閣殊無成立之可能也。</p>
<p>總之。齋藤内閣之崩毁。僅爲日本宦海升沉之一幕。於其國内外之整個政策。當不致有過大之變化。惟所謂「非常時」之論調。恐將隨新閣成立而更見增高。是以遠東問題中之國際糾葛。不僅不能漸次解除。甚且變本而加厲焉。</p>

<p>事變起於改組褐衫黨</p>

<p>春秋御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯　　還有一種算是十分希罕的東西，喚做猴頭，大槪跟打網球用的球一樣大小。它的來源也是四川，而且大部份，總是呈進宫來給太后享用的。（譯者按··猴頭也是一種野生的菌類植物。産在宜昌和四川方面的深山裏頭。但是因爲産量極少，不容易找到，所以它的價値便貴起來了。用來做菜或調羹，滋味和冬菇，麻姑相彷彿。因爲它的形狀像猴子的頭，故有「猴頭」之稱。這種東西也並不限於宫中有，北平市上常可以見到。也像銀耳一般的裝在很精美的錦匣裏頭，富貴人家買來當做送人的禮物。不過這東西假的極多，普通人不辨眞僞，往往化了很高的代價，而買到假的東西，祇有在淸宫裏用的，便從來没有假貨。）呈進宫來的時候，總是每兩個猴頭裝一錦匣，錦匣常用極好的黄綢做襯托，那種外觀，尤其比銀耳來得富麗了。　　猴頭有種種製法，也可以把整個東西擱在文火上蒸着，也可以切成一片一片的煎炒，有時候把它混和在各種肉食裏，也可以增加幾許鮮味；尤其是和在羊肉裏面，格外可口。就是用來做湯，其味亦不在雞湯之下。　　還有一種「髮菜，」在現代的食品裏，也很少有得看見了。它是細得像頭髮一樣的東西，所以呌做髮菜。嚴格的講起來，髮菜實在也是一種菌類，而且也是寄生在某種喬木上的下等植物。它的來源地又是四川。丨四川眞可算是一處多産美味的地方了！不過髮菜的滋味，却未見其美在何處，而它的用途，也並不廣，只有把它截斷了，混在猪肉裏煎炒，倒很有幾分特殊的風味。（七三）廻瀾閣  錢醉竹　　提起靑島的廻瀾閣，很有歷史上的關係。當淸季初創海軍的時候，中國未嘗無人，早就注意到這荒凉的膠州灣，是沿海的要港。無奈因爲經費不够的緣故，所以僅僅由李鴻章，札調登州總兵章高元，率兵四營，移駐靑島。至今還有一個「老衙門」的遺蹟，供我們憑弔。這老衙門，便是當初高總兵華路藍縷開創的軍營。（在今廻瀾閣東一箭地）同時爲便利我國海軍上陸起見，便修建了一座棧橋；從中山路底的海岸起，一直伸展到海水深處，足有三十餘丈長。宛若臥虹，風景很是不惡。中間經德日兩國的修葺，益發雄偉壯美。每當夕陽初下，素魄流輝的時候，不少靑年愛侣，携手微步；更有許多木屐兒，携着釣竿，臨流垂釣。可惜釣得的魚，起水便死，多數中看不中吃。好得魚翁之意不在魚，無非享受那天然美的風味罷了。　　近來經市當局的整頓，大加刷新，不但棧橋的幅面加闊，兩旁添設座橋；並且在棧橋南端，蓋了一座美輪美奂的「廻瀾閣」，與對面的「小靑島」，對峙爭雄，傑閣凌雲，孤嶼聳翠，人巧天工，各極其勝，眞令人徘徊依戀不忍去。　　然而一想到重重恥痕，歷歷艱危，又不禁代這壯美河山，發生害怕哩。賣燒餅老人  巴淸　　聽得遠的呌賣燒餅大油條聲，肚了裏面覺到餓，急忙開了門，等賣燒餅者的降臨。　　時候，到底己是初夏了，淸晨五點鐘，街上的店舖，都關得靜悄悄地，一陣淸凉的風，向我身上撲上，因祇着了一件汗衫，便不覺打了一個寒噤！　　黯然慘白的路燈光下，我看見他一步一步的己經走來了。　　經過了我的呼喚，他便把籃子放在地下，滿面笑容的問··　　「先生，買幾個燒餅，幾條油條」。　　「三個燒餅，二條油條够了」隨手把應需的錢遞給他。　　於是他便拿出燒餅油條給我，好在時間尚早，我便搭　問他道··　　「你今年多大歲數了」。　　「七十二歲」。　　「你幹這賣燒餅油條，有幾年了呀！」　　「五個年頭了」。　　「看你的口音，不像本地人，好像紹興人，對嗎？」　　我是無意的問着，可是，却觸起了這老年人的傷悲，抽了一口氣··　　「唉！先生，咱自紹興人，有一個兒子，在紹地開了一爿水菓店，家中有錢呢，可這小畜生說我年紀老了，祇能吃，不能做，故此不養我，我······出於没法，才幹這賣燒餅生意的。　　我這樣想着··「養兒防老，積榖防飢」，難道眞有這般忤逆的兒子，家中有錢，不思報父親養育之恩的嗎？　　「先生，明天再交易吧，」老人說吧，拿起籃子，又兜攬主顧去了。　　我望着這老人走去，對了他的背影，心中覺到萬分的惆悵。東北四連長  張恨水　　三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣　　全營殉國赤眼入槍林　　他們用飛機來偵察過了，說是這裏没有軍隊呢。得啦，我話也說完了，你槍斃我罷，我願意死在同胞手裏。自强道··捉到了間牒，照軍法是處死刑的。不過你是來自首的，這當别論。暫時把你綁了起來，等打完了仗再說，那間牒道··連長，你快預備罷，敵人也就來啦。自强對於這個間牒，雖然還有點戒心，但是他情願冒死來自首，覺得中國人還不曾良心死盡，這仗還値得一打。立刻將埋伏的弟兄，又佈置了一番那天上的銀色灰幕，更慢慢變得漆黑，這邊山崖上對於對面山崖上的人，也有些不能看見了。在這個當兒，遠遠的就送來一種沙沙的響聲，正是敵人踏着雪地，向這裏進行了，大家都覺得危難的關鍵，巳經到了頭上，身上雖是滿覺着熱血沸騰，但是各人表面上，都極力的鎭靜起來，連鼻息都有不讓它透出來的意味。慢慢的那踏雪沙沙作響的聲音，巳經哄傳到了耳朶邊下，各人不但是感到血管沸騰，而且覺得心裏有些震動，好像要馬上迎上前去，開槍亂放一頓才好，那脚步踏雪聲，走着越來越近了，一直響到這山夾溝裏。這時除了步履之聲而外，那鐵器的撞擊聲，馬蹄的碰踢聲，也就十分淸楚。明明知道這過來的人，不會在少數，但是大家立刻覺到現在成了以少敵多局勢，情形是更加着嚴重，越是極力的用理智來克復情感，不讓五官四肢，有一點動作。雖然人都躺在冰天雪地裏頭，然而大家都忘記了這是冰天雪地。那響聲由山夾溝裏過去，也不雜言語聲。（四二四）　　共同奮鬥  月玲天橋的貧民  人偉　　終日流連在王府井或東交民巷的人，是永遠認爲北京是個富庶無比的天府；假使你走完了整個的天橋之後，就會意外地感到一個地方竟劃分了兩個世界。　　住在天橋的人，穿的是單薄，襤褸，破碎的布衫褲，吃的是難以下嚥的窩窩豆；五顏六色的灌腸和羊肚，便是他們唯一的大菜，板凳擺成八陣圖的豆汁挑子，便是他們臨時的咖啡座。他們的特殊本領便是挨凍，受餓，吃苦；但他們雖苦，却也一般地需要着調劑生活的各種娛樂··三五條板凳列着，便可做說書塲，江湖賣藝者把雙手一拱，說了聲「在家靠父母，出外靠朋友「的老套，便有成羣的大人小孩圍將過來，兩枚銅子可以看到西洋景中的半裸大姑娘，三大枚便可以在小菜館兒喝一包高末，（卽茶葉之一種。）假若腰裏纏有十幾個子兒的話，便不難聽到大鼓，甚至於搭着蓆棚的大戲塲中，也可以去賞光賞光了。　　他把最普遍的職業便是挑東西拉車兒，横豎這貧民集合所的壯士，有的是不怕風吹雨打的兩條腿骨。上海療養院視産慈病感念璧妹  庚白　　郊外輕陰閟夕陽，棕欄曳綠野花黄。郤尋病榻風廊畔，各有華年百轉腸。　　濃綠樓陰過盡春，憐君更念眼中人。天荒地老吾無悔，不是夫妻定不親。拉雜話都市的夏  巴玲　　自從「夏之神」，來到人間以後，都市中又換了一番景象了。　　號稱繁華之衝的南京路，那大减價的旗幟，顯然的己寫着「夏季大减價」，或是「夏季大犧牲」的字樣了，歌曲從空氣中播音起來，希望招徠些主顧，可是，在不景氣籠罩着的整個上海，仍然是引不起觀衆的購買，因爲大部份的人，巳失却他們的購買力了！　　大街小巷之中，冰淇淋，酸梅水，······的攤頭，也着實不少，這也是夏神來了以後的産物，可是，大部份都是不十分淸潔的，於是，時疫在夏天中，也特别的多。　　摩登的姑娘們！穿了輕薄的衣衫，甚至赤裸了雙腿，雙臂，在熱鬧的街道上招搖過去，肉感的誘人，引起了許多人的注意，羨慕，傾倒，·······　　有錢的當人們，家裏裝了電風扇，出入有汽車代步，消夏有汽水，西瓜，這種生活，是多麽的使窮措大眼紅啊！　　所以，在都市的夏季中，最苦的要算一般苦力，和黄包車夫了，他們受了生活的鞭子之壓迫，不得不流着汗去工作，喘着氣來換飯吃，這是最可憐不過的一件事了！是烸夏季測騐  火雪明　每年有夏季，夏季一定很熱。就爲了熱，都市人的生活，便巧妙地變更，自家雖不是澳大利亞的預言家，但對六月中的上海，是感覺到趣味的，因爲我的血脈中滿流着靑年人的熱情；由我說一說夏季市街的風景，請映上先生小姐們的腦膜面不够好嗎？　　白糖梅子的聲音過了節候，替之以「阿要倫敎糕」，那賣糕的廣東人，會把盛着白糕的筐子裏在頭頂心，而不用雙手去把握的。小衖堂裏的赤膊孩子聽到這親切甜香的呼喚，一個一個飛出來瞧，有的丢了銅圓買，送進小嘴吧，津津有味地嚼；另外幾個孩子，突出了眼，垂了手，在嚥吐液。　　太陽熱照屋角上，撑着偌大的油傘，下面是出賣廉價冷飲的攤子。汽水用糖湯與小蘇打混化而成，酸梅湯裏躱着醉死的蒼蠅，西瓜瓤紅得不透明，汽車在軟的柏油路上跳過，一陣灰塵朝天噴沙似的。　　寫着「小五車」的壁角裏，還露有黄包車夫的大毛腿，藝術地放溺。旁邊是個垃圾桶，蒼蠅附在瓜皮上啃，聽見人聲，一窠蜂似的飛散，飛到小店家的糖食盒子裏，麵館的菜籃裏。　　新生活運動達到了最高潮，領鈕不結是不行的，怎麽得裸體？不成體統，實礙國際觀瞻；拉進公安局，掏幾毛錢，換一件汗衫，汗衫廠出品增加，多雇了工人，於是農村經濟又有轉機。　　然而上海的另一横面，光滑的洋房子裏，散布了冷氣，不够凉，大號電風扇的金葉子轉着，不够凉，喝冰水和冰酒，不够凉，全赤裸着上下身的肉體，女人是腰間掛了一小片薄綢。笑，跳躍，歌唱，擁抱·······。　　吳淞海岸的夕陽光裏，有五色的綢傘，罩没了年靑的男女，有笑聲吻聲滾出，這太陽眞熱得舒服。在高橋海濱的白沙地帶，正和虹口游泳池不多··有不少姑娘穿了羊毛游泳衫，立在沙石叢中，要人家替伊們照相，丨丨登報丨丨游泳家！　　總之，有的地方在流汗，有的地方在撲粉，有的地方拍着蒼蠅，有的地方塗着油板，有的地方是火窟，有的地方是冰窖，有的地方是·······。</p>

<p>自由談關於大衆語文學底建設  王任叔　　我以爲在這大衆語文學的名詞下，首先要决定的，是「大衆」這個名詞底屬性。因爲「大衆」這個名詞，根本是含義籠統，没有確定的屬性的。在封建君皇之前，山呼萬歲的人民，固然可呌大衆；在革命的曠塲裏，大喊打倒擁護的也可呌大衆。我們現在要建設大衆語文學，如其不僅僅限於語言底範嚋裏，正如胡適之先生所說，還要包含大衆意識的。那麽，我們將以那一類大衆作爲基礎呢。落後的大衆意識和前進的大衆意識，其間相差的距離，差不多有一世紀之遠。自希望眞命天子底出現，以至於發現了自己，丨想由自己來負担歷史的任務的大衆，在現階段的中國，恰巧對比地出現着。在這時候，所謂大衆語文學之建設，不得不發生一絶大的困難和矛盾了。　　其次，要提到爲什麽現在有人要担倡大衆語文學呢，及提倡這大衆語文學底作用是在那裏的問題了。這大約可作如下解釋。大衆語提倡底契機，是在文言復興運動的刺激下，作爲反文言文復興運動，同時，更使白話運動深入於大衆而起來的。所以從後一意義來說，也就是白話底奥伏赫變。（本報讀書問答欄中把這一意義也呌做「反白話」。實際上，反白話底「反」，與反古文底「反」，有其不同的意義、反古文是從其對立形態上來說的，反白話則是一種自身底揚棄與調整。這一點應該加以區别）。而所以要把白話奥伏赫變來，就是爲的要深入大衆，接近大衆。這基礎正築在許多大衆，還在希望眞命天子，還看不到自己歷史的任務，而必須加以敎育這一點上。大衆語文學在這敎育的意義上，才把前項所說的落後大衆與前進大衆意識底衝突，（也就是落後大衆意識與歷史的進展間底矛盾）統一起來了。就是大衆語文學底建設者，是以生産大衆爲其對象，以前進的大衆意識爲作品的内容，用大衆所活用的語言而從事創作。　　但在這前提下，立刻又發生了一種矛盾。就是在非大衆本身的「特殊者羣」丨丨如現在提出大衆語文學的作家們丨丨負担起現階段的大衆語文學建設任務的時候，如何能使語言大衆化呢。換句話，這些「特殊者羣」，大都爲他們自身階級所决定，比較是便於運用五四式（或買辦式）的白話的。要他們更進一步創造大衆語，是不可能的，卽使勉强要裝塲面，硬把語言弄成大衆化；其流弊所至，反把那些浮動的容易接受的非生産大衆駡街的語詞盡量地吸取了。這現象，在現階段中國較進步的作品裏，己顯著地發揮出來。記得文學月報裏，曾經登載過一首駡讀書雜誌派長時，魯迅先生曾加以指摘。而産生這一詩篇底實際原因，却在這點上。　　問題一開展到這里，覺得大衆語文學底建設根本有個矛盾，似乎不大可能的了。但這可不然。要解决這個矛盾，方法是有的。那就是作家底實踐問題。就是一句老口號「到民間去」的問題。就是參加到生産大衆中去一同生活的問題。祇有在實踐中，能增加作品裏大衆的語彙；祇有在實踐中，能削弱大衆間對於封建殘餘觀念底擁護。能在作品中增加了大衆語彙，那就是能把作品和大衆發生了關係，盡了敎育的任務；同時，能削弱大衆間封建殘餘底觀念，那麽再透過作品，就很容易引起大衆來作反封建以及反帝的運動，而展開了另一個塲面。（反帝應與反封建相聯結的。因爲在現階段中國底封建勢力，實在是帝國主義爲便利其本身底侵略而扶植起來的。）那時候不特文言復興運動，失掉了它的根据丨丨基礎，卽買辦式的白話，也自然而然地淘汰了。然而大衆語文學，一進展到那時候，其自身又必須奥伏赫變了。新出來的，應是「什麽」文學了吧。　　當然，這一過程，决不如上所說那麽械機和單純。大衆語文學的建設，必需有其他的動力，就是社會變革中的主要動力。那不能這篇短文所能詳盡述反，也就止於此了。　　我底結論是這樣··在大衆語文學建設過程中··落後大衆意識和歷史的進展間底衝突，是可用敎育這一意義給予以統一。而現階段非大衆出身之作家們其所固有的便於運用的語言，和大衆語間底矛盾，是可以實踐給以統一的。而實踐呢，是能統一一切問題中之矛盾的。論天道不反  稜磨　　不一定八股文中才右「夫天地乃宇宙之乾坤」樣的濫調，一切的文言文都多少靠浮詞濫調撑塲面。如果本以爲文章只是一座架子，即原可由得他去撑空塲面，不幸每有人用上一句浮詞濫調，竟以爲抓住了眞理。　　十年前有人批駁「物必先腐也，而後蟲生之」的不通，但作文言的人决不肯改信蟲生而後物腐。現在呢，「天道周星，物極必反」又成了武器了，可是這句浮詞，并不比物腐蟲生通得多少。　　對於老先生們，我勸他們最好謹守聖人之訓，認淸了天道遠」不必多談，否則至少得知道現在的天，巳不似從前一樣地神秘。　　我們現在巳不能再相信有一個什麽在主宰的天。如果所謂天道，是從天體運動的「自然性」演繹出來，則我們縱不談這自然性未必與人事發生什麽連帶關係，這自然性也并不是「周而復始」的好比擬。　　幸好時間并不曾被人誤解。没有人以爲明天的早晨，是今天的早晨的重覆。那末明天早晨東升的太陽，怎能說是今天早晨東升的太陽的重覆。　　就使忘去了時間，每天的太陽，也不是都在東方的同一點。升起的，這樣每天也就不是一個「周而復始」。放長一點說，經過一回歸年，太陽可以在一年前同日的同點東升了，然而這時太陽在天球上的位置，却又退回了五十秒。地球也許願意永遠一致地在軌道上跑，但太陽自己也要走，於是永遠不能周而復始。　　我們希望太陽也有軌道，千億萬年後，有一天走回原來的位置嗎？確也許有這麽一條軌道，但等太陽在軌道上周而復始，那些别的恒星，比他走得慢的，比他走得快的，向他來的，背他去的，早巳改換了位置，再不是原來的環境了。　　并且說起千百萬年，又遇到這永不「周而復始」的時間在作崇。在千億萬年的長期内，太陽很可以巳經漸漸變老，或意致逼臨了死滅之境。再加太陽在他的旅路上，也不是很安然的。他要經過布滿碎石的空間，他要闖入别個星國的領域。說不定忽然闖着意外，無端夭折。也說不定受外力的壓迫，走上岔道。　　我們的世界丨地球丨并不是一個怎樣龐大的東西，然而也足供人旅行一生，而仍未走　，所以人類己儘可以不必像蒼蠅樣飛一個圈子仍回原地。世間的所以仍多打一圈仍回原地的人類，那只是因爲人類更近於蒼蠅。至於宇宙丨天丨之大，就是以一個太陽系去和他打比，仍比以一個人去和地球打比不知大了多少。太陽和他的家族，在宇宙中儘多可去之地，無須在小範圜内亂打圈子。　　其實，凡是一個在活動着的東西，一定不絶地在變動着而永遠不能變回原樣，這是最簡單最易明瞭的「自然性」。爲什麽眞談起自然（天）來轉把他忽略呢。老實，他并没有眞想天道與自然性的關連，只是在寫出自然性這題目後，不覺就想到「物極必反」的浮詞濫調。不但不曾去考慮天道不反，連古來就承認的天道「無極」也忘記了。　　中國天文學的敎育素不發達，也許，爲了好利用「天道」這空洞的名詞，亂人耳目吧。懷念  吕紹光　　故園的花，寂寂地開，寂寂地落了。那淪流在異國的人兒，還是害着抑鬱的心病嗎？　　一番細雨一番風，　　消逝在故園的。　　悽冷的殘夢里，　　那淪流在異國的人兒，　　可曾眷念到故人的寂寞呢？毁滅  馬精武　　是一個醉人的初夏的下午，天上的白雲和鳥雲在並排地奔馳，陽光忽隱忽現；微風吹來爲帶了一陣幽香的氣息。　　同行的是ＷＫ和我三個，都是窮酸氣十足的小學敎員。　　「到閘北去嗎？」當我們參加了一個在職務上必須參加的會議以後，我提議。　　「也好，去憑弔一下尚公小學吧！一君很感塲地回答我，因爲我們三個人都曾經在尚公敎過書。　　「尚公的遺址，恐怕找不到了吧！」　　這時我們己踏上戰後的寳山路，兩旁盡是斷垣頽壁，有些毁壞了的建築，巳經完全拆去，幾乎辨不出原來是甚麽地方了；至於那些没有拆去的建築；也顫巍巍地轟立空中，壁縫裏迸出一根兩根的靑草。　　商務印書館和東方圖書館的遺址漸漸展開在我們的眼前。鋼骨水泥的輪廓依舊孤獨地站在靑堆裏，只是它的全身己渍灑上了無數的槍洞，有幾處牆壁巳現出了　隙，鋼筋也有些隱藏不住了。　　我們三個走到商務總廠的門口，在大門上看見一塊「謝絶參觀」的牌子，字跡己經有些糢糊。　　「它將永遠謝絶參觀了！」Ｋ君笑着說。　　「尚公小學在那兒呢」Ｍ君幾乎找不到他曾經敎過四年書，並且溺愛過一位女孩子的那個尚公小學。　　「怕就在這兒過去些吧！」我發現商務印書圍牆旁邊所築的籬笆，就是從前尚公小學所在的寳興西里的衖口。　　「不是！不是！還要走過去呢，Ｋ君擺出他在這兒敎過八年書的老架子來。　　我們沿着一條小溝的旁邊前進，拆去了房屋的基地一高一低地迎接着我們的脚步，商務印書館和東方圖書館的遺址，骷髏似地在向我們獰笑，天上的烏雲，也戰勝了白雲，給我們遮住猛烈的陽光。　　「尚公小學的遺址在那兒呢？我找得有些不耐煩了。　　「完全拆去了」！Ｋ君像敎小孩子似地回答我。　　在我們的前面，有一片淺淺地平鋪着的草地，上面坐着三五個小孩子，在談笑着。他們的四週，盡是瓦礫堆和尺把長的靑草。　　「這塊草地怕就是從前養眞幼稚園裏的草地了。」Ｗ君發表他仔細觀察了之後的結論。　　「這兒便是尚公小學大門的所在！你看，門柱不是還直竪着麽？」Ｋ君呌了起來。　　「這兒是魚池的舊址，現在給塡塞了！」······」　　「這兒是······」　　我們經過一番激烈的爭論之後，終於寗靜了下來。每個人的臉上，都浮着苦笑。當日本國帝主義的飛機在轟炸閘北的時候，我和Ｗ君正躱在鄉下避難，Ｋ君也天天在他的故鄉丨丨長江口的一個小島上丨丨聽砲聲。我們雖然都在這兒厮混過多年，可是尚公小學最後毁滅的一幕慘劇，竟没有看見！　　「讓我帶些紀念品回去吧！」　　君在瓦礫堆裏亂尋了好久，始終没有尋到甚麽。　　「該是回去的時候了，别再躭擱了，反正也找不到！」Ｋ君急於想去會唔一位朋友。　　到了横浜橋，跳上一路電車，車廂裏擠滿了異國的少女，露在衫袖外面的酥胸和粉臂，給了我們很大的誘惑。車子一站一站地開過去，馬路兩旁的摩天樓高高地聳立着，「夏季大减價」的旗子隨風飄着，無綫電收音機不住地唱着，······我們就這樣給無情的電車拖進了另一個世界。從廣州到上海（二）  蒲風碼頭上　　香港是舊遊地，只逗留了一晚，又一個上午，就趁輪經汕赴滬。　　在碼頭上，碰着了一隻張燈結彩的小輪，「水陸招幽」四大字下面，有幾個和尚或是尼姑（我們没法去檢查他們是男是女，這裏也就只得雌雄並立了。）在呢喃着。後來，嗖的一聲，車輪滾動了；大槪業己招得渺渺幽靈跟着輪船跑罷！　　這幽靈被帶送到什麽地方呢？丨丨我想。　　假使城市是屠塲跟墓地，狂亂的集會跟淫靡的跳舞，高樓跟地窖，樹膠跟腦油，汽車跟黄包車，紳士跟乞丐，軌道的繁　跟利慾的沸騰·····幽靈呵，你死而有知，你感到憎惡，所以你被運送到靜的鄉村裏去嗎？　　丨丨哦！城市！縱是幽靈也不安於居麽？　　正當我這麽想的時候，我的朋友說了一聲「再會」。於是，我下小艇子裏，旋即離開碼頭，朝大輪船那邊跑了。自然，只消一刻工夫，小艇子又將和碼頭接吻，而我呢，什麽時候再履這塊地方哟！　　城市呵！我遠了你！但是，我是活人，如今還又是投向城市呵！檢查　　那日火車一到九龍，站上就有我們的雄糾糾的貴同胞在侍候着做檢查工作。不用說，衣裳漂亮的隨便就可過關，假使你衣裳不漂亮，手裏又提着皮匣，那自然不會漏網而極有被檢查的資格了。我呢，反領因天熱而没有穿在身上，手裏又提了一隻不小的皮匣，顯然是逃不掉的了。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong, along with Deputy Directors Zheng Baozhao and Xu Wenguo, sent a telegram on the 2nd to the Ministry of Railways, taking responsibility for the Chadian train bombing. They stated that the Beiping-Shenyang line was implemented on July 1st, but unfortunately, a train bombing occurred at Chadian Station, resulting in many passenger casualties. The directors and others handled the matter poorly and failed to prevent it. Therefore, they resigned, pending the Ministry's response. In the meantime, Xu Wenguo and Zheng Baozhao will be responsible for the bureau's affairs. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, police of the Beining Railway searched the bombed-out No. 11 carriage and found two unexploded iron boxes containing explosives. Their estimated weight is the same as the one that exploded. If all three boxes had exploded at the same time, the locomotive would have been destroyed, and the subsequent carriages would have inevitably overturned, resulting in even more severe damage. This afternoon, the Beining Railway Bureau sent a telegram to police forces along the entire line, ordering them to apprehend the train bomber. A reward of 50,000 yuan will be offered for any successful apprehension. (2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, the Beining Railway Bureau instructed all railway police along the line to conduct reasonable checks on passengers boarding the trains if they are deemed suspicious before they board. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This afternoon, the Beining Railway Bureau sent a lengthy telegram to the Ministry of Railways, Huang Fu, and He Yingqin, reporting the details of the bombing incident and outlining the post-disaster measures. This afternoon at 5 p.m., the Beining Railway Bureau convened a meeting of key officials to discuss the post-disaster measures for the injured and deceased passengers in the Chadian train bombing. It was decided that the railway bureau would cover the medical expenses for the injured patients in the hospitals where they are being treated until they recover and are discharged. For the deceased, the railway bureau will take photographs for the families to identify the bodies and purchase coffins for temporary burial. If the families of the deceased wish to transport the bodies back to their hometowns, transportation will be free of charge. After the first Beiping-Shenyang express train was bombed in Chadian on the 1st, it did not stop at the small stations along the way. It arrived at Shanhaiguan at 7:10 p.m. that afternoon, one hour late. This morning, the railway bureau received a telegram stating that the train arrived in Shenyang safely at around 7 a.m. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Daoge, a passenger injured in the Chadian bombing, died of severe injuries this morning at Tianjin Ma Doctor Hospital. Yin was 22 years old, from Xiangyou County, and a graduate of Qinghua University in Beiping. He was currently employed at the Shanghai Huaye Bank. This time, he traveled with his sister, Yin Dehui, 23 years old, a third-year student at Jinling Women's University in Nanjing, to Beidaihe to meet his brother, Gongyi. They happened to be traveling in the bombed No. 11 carriage. Dehui was severely injured and died at Chadian Station. Before her death, she spoke fluent English, telling Western passengers her name and the location of her brother, Gongyi. When the Westerner arrived at Beidaihe, he shouted on the platform, "Is Yin Dehui's brother here?" Gongyi heard the call and went to meet him. Through the Westerner's account, he came to Tianjin on the morning of the 2nd to identify the body. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yiwo, the head of the Kwantung Army Special Affairs Agency stationed in Shanhaiguan, came to Beiping this morning because the Beiping-Shenyang train encountered an accident in Chadian yesterday. At noon, he, along with Japanese military officer Captain Shibayama and Tsuchiya Tsunekawa, visited Yin Tong's private residence to discuss the future safety and protection of the Beiping-Shenyang railway. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain gentleman who was injured in the bombing of the first Beiping-Shenyang train yesterday while passing through Chadian and returned to Beiping for treatment, said, "I took the Beiping-Shenyang train to Shenyang yesterday morning. We arrived at Tanggu around 1:00 p.m. After the train traveled for a dozen minutes, a wisp of white smoke suddenly appeared from under the seats in the front four or five rows of the carriage. As the passengers were staring at it, the bomb suddenly exploded. Iron filings and wooden fragments flew inside the carriage. The front part of the carriage was completely blown open. I was unconscious for about twenty minutes before I regained some consciousness. My cheek was cut by iron fragments, and I was helped off the train. The inside of the carriage was filled with smoke. A woman had one arm blown off, and the brain of the baby in her arms was blown through, a ghastly sight. The train attendant, Jin Da, had his brains blown out and died instantly. Several others were seriously injured and sent to Tanggu and Tianjin. I returned to Beiping to seek medical treatment on my own." (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beining Railway Bureau announced, "To ensure the safety of the majority of passengers, the bureau's railway police, whether in the station or on the train, may conduct temporary checks on passengers' luggage and persons as necessary from now on. However, inspection police have been strictly ordered not to cause disturbance. We ask for the special understanding of all passengers." (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Passengers arriving in Beiping from Shanhaiguan said that when the first train arrived in Shanhaiguan yesterday, the Japanese military police and the puppet state's border police conducted very strict checks on passengers, causing great anxiety among the passengers. Passengers leaving the customs from inside the pass had to pay an entry fee of three jiao per person. However, those entering the customs from outside the pass were not checked as strictly. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the first Beiping-Shenyang train was bombed in Chadian yesterday, the Beining Railway Bureau is currently handling the aftermath for the deceased and injured passengers and has decided to provide generous compensation. The security guards have also been ordered to strengthen security. All passengers who look like students or act suspiciously will be inspected. This morning, the Beiping-Shenyang express train departing from Beiping East Station had even tighter security at the platform than yesterday. The police, military police, and detectives were almost all out in force. The passengers were also extremely crowded. The train departing this morning consisted of a South Manchuria Railway train, with one postal car and one baggage car, four third-class carriages, one dining car, two sleeping cars, and one first-class carriage. The number of Japanese police accompanying the train was also increased by three today, totaling nine, all riding in the first-class carriage. Our escort team changed to the first-class observation car to the east because the Japanese side did not designate seats. A total of 407 tickets were sold this morning, including 117 third-class tickets and 2 second-class tickets for outside the pass, and 288 tickets for various stations inside the pass. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the Chadian bombing, the director and deputy directors resigned to the Ministry of Railways. It is said that Yin Tong has left his post, and before a reply is received, the bureau's affairs will be temporarily maintained by the two deputy directors, Zheng Baozhao and Xu Wenguo. Two of the severely injured in the bombing died on the morning of the 2nd, a woman surnamed Song and a man named Yin Daoge, from Hunan. It was found that the young woman who died in the Chadian bombing on the 1st was named Yin Dehui, who was Daoge's younger sister. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the bombing of the Beiping-Shenyang train, Beining Railway Bureau Director Yin Tong has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Railways providing a brief report and stating that Beining Railway police will be dispatched to provide enhanced protection in the future. It is heard that the Ministry of Railways considers this only a matter of routine railway security and has not yet telegraphed back to Yin Tong with instructions on how to handle the situation. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Despite the bombing incident on the Beiping-Shenyang train the day before yesterday, the train still ran as usual today, with each car heavily guarded by Chinese and Japanese troops. The Beining Railway has announced the names of those killed yesterday, all of whom were Chinese, with no foreigners among them. When someone inquired with the Beining Railway authorities about reports from Shanhaiguan that a British man was killed, they responded that the news was inaccurate. Yesterday's bomb was placed in a yellow iron box and intended to destroy the locomotive. One of the train's employees was also killed in the explosion. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It has been learned here that a bomb exploded in a third-class carriage on the first Beiping-Shenyang train yesterday, killing three Chinese and injuring eleven others. According to a Japanese source in Shanhaiguan, one of the dead was a British man. This has been denied today by another Japanese source. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) This morning, the express train from Shenyang arrived at the East Station on time. The number of passengers was not very high. It is heard that most of them came from stations inside the pass. The Japanese reporters who came to Beiping on the train from Shenyang included Fujita Tsuruo and Nakamura Hayata from the Dentsu News Agency, Minoru Harada from the Tokyo Nichinichi and Osaka Mainichi, and Waki ​​Tsutae from the Manchuria Daily News, as well as Manabu Tagami from the Dalian News. Many reporters traveling to Beiping came to the station to welcome them. Ota Kuzaku, the director of the puppet Fengshan Railway Bureau, came west on the train this morning to visit Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau. Not knowing that Yin had come to Beiping, he got off the train in Tianjin. This morning, when the Beiping-Shenyang train arrived in Beiping, Yin Tong personally went to the station to inspect. According to Yin, after the Chadian incident, the Railway Bureau has decided to take responsibility and provide generous compensation to the deceased and injured passengers. After yesterday's talks with Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, ​​the Japanese side made no further requests. I plan to offer a reward for the capture of the murderer and plan to report everything to He [Yingqin] this afternoon. I plan to stay in Beiping for a while, and then go to Tianjin. Huang [Fu]'s return to Beiping is unconfirmed. The rumor that the Japanese side requested an increase in the number of police is not accurate. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Customs Inspection Procedures at Shanhaiguan After the Train Service Started <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The customs inspection procedures at Shanhaiguan after the train service started are as follows: (1) Passengers' carry-on luggage should be inspected on the train between Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao. (2) Luggage carried in the baggage car, except as otherwise provided in Article 3, should be inspected at the customs inspection factory at Shanhaiguan Station. The inspection time is temporarily set at 60 minutes. (3) According to Article 2, all inspections should be carried out in Shanhaiguan. However, passengers boarding the train from stations inside the pass, if the station has a customs office or branch, may request the customs to inspect their luggage locally at that station, seal it tightly with wire, and add a lead seal. Those traveling from outside the pass to stations inside the pass, if the station they arrive at has a customs office or branch, may also request the Shanhaiguan office to seal their luggage tightly with wire and add a lead seal. Upon arrival at the destination station, another inspection will be carried out. However, after the luggage is sealed by the customs, it should be transported by the railway bureau to the destination station, and the railway bureau should open a separate list according to the items listed on the railway receipt and hand it over to the customs for examination. (4) Passengers who carry taxable goods in their luggage should be taxed according to the current tariff regulations. The tax should be collected locally by the customs office at the station where the luggage is inspected. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e16">At the Central Memorial Week <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Director Wang reported at the Central Party Headquarters Memorial Week: Yesterday was July 1st, the anniversary of the founding of the National Government, and also the day when the most important part of the resolutions of this National Financial Conference began to be implemented. I remember that on March 12 this year, the anniversary of the death of the Premier, I reported at the Central Party Headquarters, describing that the elimination of harsh and miscellaneous taxes should begin in Jiangxi. The harsh and miscellaneous taxes in Jiangxi amounted to about 250,000 yuan per month, and their largest use was for education and defense expenses. Because Jiangxi is an important province for suppressing bandits, the Executive Yuan decided that the Ministry of Finance would allocate 250,000 yuan per month to compensate Jiangxi for the elimination of harsh and miscellaneous taxes, which has been implemented since March. At that time, I also stated that the elimination of harsh and miscellaneous taxes should start in Jiangxi, and it is hoped that it will be popularized throughout the country in the shortest possible time. Minister of Finance Kong [Xiangxi] also shared this view, so he convened the National Financial Conference to solve the central and local financial problems. The most important part is to reduce the surcharges on land tax and eliminate harsh and miscellaneous taxes. These are all local revenues, and the central government cannot just say that they should be reduced or eliminated. There must be compensation measures to make it a reality. The plan to reduce the surcharges on land tax and compensate for it has been approved by the Executive Yuan and has been presented by the Ministry of Finance, and the full amount of the tobacco and alcohol license tax will be allocated to the localities from July 1st. The revenue from the stamp tax has also been determined to be collected and allocated uniformly. From the next fiscal year, it is planned to allocate 10% to the provinces, 30% to the counties, and 20% to subsidize remote and impoverished provinces. The plan to abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes has also been submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan based on the resolutions of the National Financial Conference, and the National Government has been requested to issue a clear order to abolish them starting on July 1st. Therefore, this year's July 1st has far-reaching significance in improving tax rates and reducing the burden on the people. Before the Financial Conference, Minister of Finance Kong personally went to Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei to conduct on-site inspections of the local financial situation. Recently, he has not avoided the heat and personally went to Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Beiping, and Tianjin to conduct on-site inspections. This determination to be courageous and practical is worthy of admiration. As for the provinces, their determination to implement the resolutions of the National Financial Conference is also very admirable, because the National Financial Conference stipulated that the period from July 1st to the end of December this year should be the period for separate implementation of the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. Therefore, after the National Financial Conference closed, representatives from various provinces returned to their provinces one after another and reported to their provincial governments and immediately began to carry out the resolutions. For example, Jiangsu Province reported to the Ministry of Finance on June 10 that the 42 most harsh and miscellaneous local taxes in various counties had been abolished immediately, without waiting until July 1st. The Executive Yuan has issued a clear order to commend them as a model. Another example is that Hubei Province reported to the Ministry of Finance on June 28 that it had begun to abolish 27 kinds of old miscellaneous taxes and would implement them on July 1st. For example, Jiangxi Province reported to the Ministry of Finance on June 25 that it had abolished the production tax on exported goods in the province ahead of schedule and would implement it from July 1st. From then on, all kinds of products produced in the province would be exempt from the production tax in order to relieve the people's suffering. For example, Zhejiang Province reported to the Ministry of Finance on June 29 that it had drafted a list of more than 280 kinds of harsh and miscellaneous local taxes to be abolished. Other provinces have also reported one after another. The first batch of abolitions was carried out so quickly, and it can be imagined that the second batch and subsequent batches will be the same. There is one important significance here that needs to be reported, because the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes not only reduces the burden on the people in a passive way, but also develops the people's strength and enriches the country's strength in a positive way. Some people think that since the government is going to work together to save the country, it should concentrate the people's strength and actively engage in construction, and should not think about reducing the burden on the people, so that all plans cannot be carried out. However, it is not known that the Chinese people have been impoverished to the extreme. If they are not nurtured, they will no longer be able to bear the burden of taxes. Everyone knows that more than 80% of the Chinese people are farmers, and the majority of China's financial income is squeezed from the farmers. It goes without saying that the surcharge on land tax is taken from the farmers, and most of the harsh and miscellaneous taxes are also taken from the farmers. The Ministry of Finance will soon publish the list of local miscellaneous taxes that Jiangsu Province has abolished first, the list of taxes and levies that Hubei's commercial ports have abolished, and the concise list of various harsh and miscellaneous taxes that Zhejiang Province has decided to abolish. Everyone will know the details at a glance. Therefore, the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes is used to reduce the burden on farmers, which is to restore the farmers' ability to produce. If the farmers' ability to produce can be restored to health, then the people's strength will naturally develop, and the country's strength will naturally be enriched. The Ministry of Finance is not only working hard to reduce the surcharges on land tax and abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes, but also encouraging the export of agricultural products, reducing or exempting taxes separately, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Central Political Conference for approval and to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to provide relief to the rural areas and regulate food supplies, the Ministry of Railways has long reduced the fees for grain transportation on all lines and has done its best to encourage transportation. The Ministry of Railways has recently re-reduced the freight rates for grain on all lines to the lowest possible level and has also reduced the freight rates for other agricultural products to alleviate the economic hardship of the rural areas. The following is a report on the special prices of various grains and agricultural products approved by the Ministry of Railways:</p>
<p>(1) Jinpu Railway: Special prices have been set for the transportation of whole-car rice from Pukou to Tianjin, the transportation of whole-car rice from Puzhen and Bengbu to Tianjin, the transportation of wheat from Yanbei to Tianjin, the transportation of flour from Bengbu to Tianjin, and the transportation of flour from Tongguan from Pukou to Xuzhou.</p>
<p>(2) Longhai Railway: Special prices have been set for various grains, the special price for the transportation of flour from Tongguan from Dapu to Xuzhou and Kaifeng, and the special price for cotton from the stations in the western section.</p>
<p>(3) Pinghan Railway: Special prices have been set for the transportation of whole-car wheat, whole-car peas, the transportation of Hunan rice to the north, and the transportation of flour from Tongguan from Zhengzhou. The special price for the transportation of flour, barley, corn, sorghum, millet, foxtail millet, etc. between Xinxiang and Shahe has also been revised. The flour item and flour in the 33rd special price of this road will also be charged at 85% of the original price.</p>
<p>(4) Jiaoji Railway: Special prices have been set for various coarse grains, wheat, and black dates, the special price for the transportation of whole-car local specialties and peas, and the special price for the transportation of whole-car flour from Jinan to Qingdao.</p>
<p>(5) Xiang'e Railway: Special prices have been set for the transportation of whole-car rice.</p>
<p>(6) Nanxun Railway: Special prices have been set for the export of rice, flour, grain, wheat, millet, soybeans, sesame, mung beans, sweet potatoes, etc.</p>
<p>(7) Daoqing Railway: Special prices have been set for various grains, and the special price for the transportation of whole-car wheat from Daokou Sanliwan to Xinxiang New Station.</p>
<p>(8) Beining Railway: Special prices have been set for the transportation of grain to the east and the special price for the transportation of whole-car flour from various stations between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan.</p>
<p>(9) Pingsui Railway: Special prices have been set for the transportation of whole-car grain, which are handled in nine sections. Special prices have been set for beans and noodle sheets, and special prices have been set for the transportation of domestically produced machine-made flour to the east.</p>
<p>(10) Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways: Special prices have been set for grain.</p>
<p>(11) Zhengtai Railway: Special prices have been set for grain and cotton.</p>
<p>(12) Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway: Special prices have been set for rice and grain.</p>
<p>In addition, the reduction of freight rates for agricultural products on various lines, such as peanuts, melon seeds, sesame, etc., is too numerous to mention. Recently, the responsible transportation of special-priced wheat on various lines has also been approved, and all lines have been ordered to give priority to the allocation of vehicles when requested to transport rice, reduce transportation procedures, and facilitate commercial transportation to alleviate food shortages. With regard to financial relief to rural areas, the Ministry of Railways has temporarily approved the transportation of cash by the Farmers' Banks of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, and the fees will be reduced according to the measures of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for a trial period of one year. It has also compiled a survey and statistics of wheat to study the reasons for the sluggish sales of wheat, and has investigated the quantity of various grains transported in and out of various lines and stations in order to seek thorough relief of food shortages. In addition, there are other recent special price lists for agricultural products on various lines that cannot be described in detail and will be published in the Rural Reconstruction Committee's bulletin for your reference.</p>
<p>Recently, the hard work of the Ministries of Finance and Railways has undoubtedly benefited the farmers, just as it is undoubtedly beneficial to require the people to bear heavier burdens in times of national crisis in order to build all kinds of salvation projects. Then, who will bear the cost of these construction projects? Reducing the burden on farmers to restore their production capacity is indeed an essential element for developing the people's strength and restoring the country's strength, but is there a risk of being too late? Some comrades are deeply concerned about these issues, so they are eager to borrow foreign debts. The nature of attracting foreign investment and setting up industries is completely different from political borrowing. The Premier clearly pointed out various necessary methods and conditions in the Industrial Plan, but if we want to borrow foreign debts, we must first understand a principle, that is, if we want to borrow new debts, we must reorganize old debts. If old debts cannot be reorganized, then the government has no credibility abroad, and who will borrow new debts to you? Therefore, the Executive Yuan has held several debt reorganization meetings in succession, and has instructed the Ministry of Finance and other relevant departments to plan in detail according to the principles resolved. The Ministry of Finance originally had a committee for reorganizing domestic and foreign debts, and now it is stepping up its work. As for the Ministry of Railways, it has been working hard to reorganize road debts for the past three years amidst hardships and difficulties, and has gradually raised the prices of road debts. Now, let us try to list a comparison table of the highs and lows of various Chinese railway bonds in the foreign market in January of the 21st year and April of the 23rd year, as follows:</p>
<p>Comparison Table of Highs and Lows of Various Chinese Railway Bonds in the Foreign Market (in pounds)</p>
<p>Year 21 Year 23</p>
<p>Month Jan Month Apr</p>
<p>Beining Domestic and Foreign Loans 69.1/4 86.3/8</p>
<p>HSBC and Banque de l'Indochine Loans 53.1/2 96</p>
<p>Jinghu Loans 40.1/2 69.3/4</p>
<p>Guangjiu Loans 7.6.1/2</p>
<p>Jinpu Original Loans 7.3/4 38.1/2</p>
<p>Jinpu Continued Loans 7.3/4 28</p>
<p>Huhangyong Loans 63.1/4 98.1/2</p>
<p>Daoqing Loans 6 32</p>
<p>Longhai Loans No Price 19</p>
<p>Huguang Loans No Price 43.3/4</p>
<p>Railways are the most important part of construction projects. The work of the Ministry of Railways in the past three years can be proved to have made progress in this comparison table. This kind of reorganizing old debts is the foundation for borrowing new debts. Not only is the railway like this, but this one example can be used to generalize the rest. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>The Saito Cabinet of Japan is likely facing a complete resignation due to the implication of former Vice Minister of Finance Kuroda in a bribery case. This current cabinet has styled itself as a detached cabinet overcoming an extraordinary situation. However, even considering its diplomatic techniques, during the so-called "emergency period" of the past two years, its actions toward China and the United States have not only failed to achieve temporary peace, but have also been dictated by the whims of the military, hastening the arrival of new crises, such as the increased troop deployment in Chahar and eastern Hebei, the entrenchment in eastern Luan, the exaggerated handling of the Zangben incident, the insistence on biased views in naval negotiations, and the aggressive dumping of cheap goods. Every action has been a deliberate provocation, exacerbating the severity of the "emergency." Such is the diplomatic record of the Saito Cabinet under the protection of the military clique. Is it believable that its successors will be able to freely restore normal international relations?</p>
<p>Let us carefully examine the traditions of Japanese politics to understand the relationship between this political shift and the future of peace in the Far East. First, among the past cabinets of Japan, the one closest to the spirit of democracy was the Hara Takashi Cabinet after World War I. All others were deeply stained with the colors of the military and bureaucracy. Since the September 18th Incident, their tendency to rely on the military has become even more rapid. Although Wakatsuki and Inukai were nominally party cabinets, they were generally controlled by the military. Inukai was even assassinated by an active-duty military officer while serving as prime minister. Throughout Japan, no one dared to advocate for the dignity of constitutional government. This shows the weakness of Japanese party politics and the strength of military politics. Second, Japan's continental policy has already been substantially implemented, and the movement for expanding maritime power is at its peak. It is rumored that the naval budget proposal for the next year will exceed 500 million yen. The army and navy air corps will also completely replace their aircraft after December of this year to cope with the so-called crisis of 1936. Third, Japanese diplomacy has historically fully demonstrated its dual nature, which is particularly evident in the Far East. Its ambassadors and consuls stationed abroad are merely figures for diplomatic formalities, while the army and navy have their specific policies. For example, when Yoshizawa advocated peace in Europe, the Japanese army was arbitrarily invading Northeast China. There is no doubt that this dual nature will continue in the future. Fourth, Japanese bureaucrats have become increasingly corrupt, leading to a loss of faith among the people. Political parties rely on financial groups, and financial groups mostly surrender to the military. Military personnel are then able to use the guise of national unity to promote the development of militarism.</p>
<p>Considering these four points, it is clear that no matter who succeeds Saito, they will not be able to escape the control of the military. According to the army's opinion, the primary condition for the successor cabinet is that it must not be a puppet of a privileged class. This means that the successor cabinet must be solely a puppet of the military. Understanding this is essential before discussing the selection of Japan's next prime minister. It is rumored that Kiyoura Keigo has the highest call for succession. Kiyoura is known as neutral, but he is too old. Even if he comes out to form a cabinet, it would likely still resemble the Saito Cabinet. Next is Konoe Fumimaro. He is a talented figure among the Japanese nobility with great expectations. The elder statesmen mostly have a favorable impression of him, and his relationship with the military is particularly close. Once the Konoe Cabinet is established, it would be practically considered a military cabinet. Hiranuma Kiichirō is an excellent politician of the Araki faction, but he has recently been suppressed by the elder statesmen. Without the enthusiastic support of the military, it would be difficult for him to rise to power. However, if he does come to power, it would merely be a disguised version of the Araki regime. Then there is Ugaki Kazushige, who is supported by the Minseito party, approved by the Seiyukai party, and has some support among military personnel. He also belongs to those close to constitutional politics, but he is opposed by middle-ranking generals in the military, making mutual understanding difficult. The likelihood of him forming a cabinet is very slim. Others, such as Suzuki and Wakatsuki, certainly have the hope of forming a cabinet according to the norms of constitutional politics. However, Japan's party politics are gradually declining today, making it impossible for a party cabinet to be established.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the collapse of the Saito Cabinet is merely a scene in the ups and downs of Japan's officialdom. It is unlikely to cause major changes in its overall domestic and foreign policies. However, the rhetoric of the so-called "emergency" is likely to increase with the establishment of the new cabinet. Therefore, the international entanglements in the Far Eastern issue will not only fail to gradually resolve, but will even worsen.</p>

Chairman Dai presided and led the ceremony. Niu Yongjian reported, stating that to reduce the suffering of the people, the government has issued a clear order to abolish exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes and will allocate taxes from tobacco and alcohol licenses to supplement the financial deficiencies of local governments. According to the essential points of national taxation: (1) All petty and burdensome taxes should be eliminated, and estate and income taxes should be implemented. (2) The people should understand the obligation to pay taxes to increase tax revenue. (3) Encourage the people's patriotic spirit and contribute to the country. He hopes that all comrades will pay attention to the above to enrich the country's financial resources and make China's future prosperous. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang's headquarters reiterated the order regarding military police, stating that civilized countries place the greatest importance on law and discipline. Recently, military personnel often disregard the authority of the police. In places beyond the jurisdiction of military police, they lack self-respect, disrupt order, and the people follow suit, leading to a decline in society, which is distressing. If the authority of the police is not respected, there will be no effective enforcement. Therefore, local police are now given the authority to intervene in military violations of discipline. Those who disobey intervention will be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for punishment according to the law. All military personnel wearing cloth uniforms must wear leggings. Violations will be dealt with by military and police personnel, and those who refuse to comply will be arrested and punished for violating orders. All should comply accordingly.

The headquarters has set a deadline of three months to eliminate the communist bandits in five provinces, and the military operations may conclude in September. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun flew to Hankou from Fancheng on the 2nd. According to him, the remaining bandit forces of Yang, Liu, and Fang in northern Hubei are scattered between Liangdang and Liangzhu, totaling about two to three thousand people, and are being encircled. The people north of Gucheng are impoverished, and the local area is suffering greatly. The area south of Gucheng is more vibrant. Most of the Sichuan bandits are concentrated in Wanyuan and Chengkou, attempting to break through and flee down eastern Sichuan, breaching the defense line in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. If they fail to flee downwards, they will attempt to change their plan to Northern Hubei. Currently, the border defense between Sichuan, Hubei, and Shaanxi is solid, so there is no other concern.

In the future, he will devote all his efforts to economic construction, improving water conservancy, and relieving the rural areas. On one hand, he will increase the productivity rate, and on the other hand, he will allow the circulation of products.

<p>Former Chief of Staff Killed in Prison</p>
<p>Stormtroopers Die Tragically, Crying Injustice</p>
<p>Secret Police Arrest Hundreds</p>
<p>(Berlin) President Hindenburg today telegraphed Chancellor Hitler and General Göring, expressing his approval for their suppression of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy, and expressing his congratulations and thanks. The clouds of suspicion regarding the President's dissatisfaction with Hitler's rule have thus been swept away.</p>
<p>It is reported that all of Vice-Chancellor Papen's staff, with the exception of one or two people, have been arrested. Although Papen himself has not been formally arrested, he is actually under surveillance. Furthermore, according to reliable sources,</p>
<p>many platoon leaders of the Stormtroopers have been executed at the Lichterfelde military academy. These executions have been carried out continuously since Sunday afternoon until midnight. According to witnesses, the party soldiers and platoon leaders were in a terrible state when they were executed. They vehemently protested their innocence, but to no avail, and ultimately bared their chests and took the bullets. It is claimed that Ernst Röhm, the commander of the Blumenthal Stormtroopers, also suffered the same tragic death. When Röhm was executed, he refused to be blindfolded.</p>
<p>According to another reliable source, Hitler's former confidant Gregor Strasser also shot himself after hearing that General Schleicher had been killed for resisting arrest. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The decisive actions taken by Chancellor Hitler and General Göring have now fully restored order to Germany. Officials announced that the purge movement launched by Hitler in Munich and Göring in Berlin has completely ended on Sunday night. After the fleeting appearance of the anti-Hitler conspiracy on Saturday, such incidents are not expected to happen again.</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoon, Chancellor Hitler held a meeting at the Chancellor's residence with Prussian Prime Minister Göring, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, and other loyal leaders. The leaders reported that the country is now calm.</p>
<p>Although the highly respected President Hindenburg repeatedly received shocking news from Berlin at his Neudeck villa, he remained silent and did not exchange any telegrams with Chancellor Hitler. This is a very strange matter.</p>
<p>Vice-Chancellor Papen's speech at the University of Marburg has aroused suspicion within the National Socialist Party. On Sunday, Papen did not leave his house all day, and although he was not arrested, his residence was constantly under police surveillance.</p>
<p>It is reported that the final action to suppress the counter-revolutionary conspiracy was implemented in Munich yesterday afternoon. The Stormtroopers'</p>
<p>commander Röhm was shot and killed after refusing to commit suicide twice. (National News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is expected that several more rebellious party members will be shot in Germany this week. A total of one hundred leaders of the SA throughout the country have been arrested and will likely be subject to military tribunals. Ten people were shot yesterday. It is reported that Vice-Chancellor Papen's close friend von Schleicher and secretary Boss were among them. As for Papen himself, he is still under house arrest and not allowed to leave home. Chancellor Hitler is now focusing all his efforts on the final purge work. However, according to a statement issued by Prussian Prime Minister General Göring, the severe actions have now ended. Berlin and Munich are currently in a calm state, and no further changes are expected. Hitler is currently in Berlin and is able to control the overall situation. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>Street Talk in Munich</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is claimed that former Chief of Staff Röhm and former Chancellor Schleicher had a relationship and conspired to take unusual actions. Röhm was personally arrested by Hitler on Saturday, and in the afternoon of that day, he received a hand</p>
<p>gun and was sarcastically urged to commit suicide. However, Röhm declared that he would never do such a thing, and that if he was to be shot, it would have to be done by Hitler himself. While speaking, he violently struck the hand of the National Socialist Party member holding the gun. Röhm then received another handgun and was urged to commit suicide within ten minutes, but Röhm consistently refused. As a result, Röhm was shot and killed. The National Socialist Party is maintaining strict secrecy regarding the details of Röhm's execution. According to what the Associated Press reporter learned, Röhm was shot around 5 p.m. yesterday. Street talk in Munich is all about Röhm's execution. However,</p>
<p>yesterday, he told the Associated Press reporter that Hitler personally ordered Röhm's execution, and claimed that his main task was to transform the Stormtroopers into a purely political organization. This statement implies abandoning the military characteristics of the Brownshirt army, which is currently being criticized by the outside world. Propaganda Minister Goebbels announced the truth of the incident to the entire country and to the United Kingdom and the United States via radio at 7 p.m. last night, and also vigorously praised Hitler and the National Socialist Party for their future efforts to create a unified nation.

<p>The Incident Began with the Reorganization of the Brownshirts</p>
<p>(Berlin) Chancellor Hitler, General Göring, and Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels are still continuing their policy of eliminating extremists. Many extremists have been shot and killed. Several more people, including many police officers, were shot this morning. Hitler, General Göring, and Dr. Goebbels held a meeting at the Propaganda Ministry this afternoon, discussing until late, but the content was not disclosed. The whole city is currently peaceful, the only difference from usual being that the police are carrying handguns and rifles, and the railway stations are filled with people traveling out of the city for the holidays.</p>
<p>Many people believe that the claim that the National Socialist Stormtroopers' leaders plotted a rebellion is not credible. It is generally thought that this incident was aimed at opposing the reorganization of the Brownshirts, as thousands of people would be dismissed after the reorganization plan was implemented, and their leisurely lives would come to an end. Their future intentions are still unclear, but Hitler preemptively acted to defeat their plot.</p>
<p>At the same time, some people believe that the claim that former Chancellor Schleicher was killed for resisting arrest is also not credible, as it is thought that Schleicher was assassinated. His wife also died protecting her husband.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from London, the atmosphere in Germany remained extremely tense at the end of the week, but tonight the surface is calmer. People in London believe that yesterday's events will further strengthen Hitler's position. The German ex-Kaiser also holds this view. Last night, he quietly listened to the German news broadcast on the radio at his Doorn residence until late at night. It is now widely rumored that the ex-Crown Prince has left German territory, but he has not yet been seen arriving in the Netherlands as of today.</p>
<p>According to the Paris Soir, President Hindenburg now wants to resign, but is being blocked by the Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Force, General Blomberg, and the ex-Crown Prince, who advised him to decide whether to stay or go after consulting with Hitler. Today, German newspapers are filled with details of yesterday's events and unanimously praise Hitler's purge actions.</p>
<p>Today, two special trains filled with guards left Berlin for Munich, but they were not wearing the honorary swords awarded by former commander Röhm, the reason for which is unknown. There are rumors that those who rebelled had been secretly communicating with a certain foreign country, so the local police are now making every effort to arrest a certain person who previously advocated independence in the Rhineland. Stormtroopers, from leaders down to flag bearers, have all been ordered not to leave their residences without permission.</p>
<p>Today, ten more National Socialist leaders were shot and killed, but their names have not yet been announced. According to witnesses to the execution of Ernst and others, the men were escorted to the Berlin Stormtroopers headquarters by Hitler's guards, interrogated by a military court, and sentenced to death in less than half an hour. They were then escorted to the headquarters parade ground at night, where they were tied up with their hands behind their backs, lined up against a wall, and shot one by one. Most of them died generously, some wept, and some begged for mercy, but Ernst and several others refused to be blindfolded. Ernst's last words were, "I die for the Führer and for Germany." The bodies of the men were handed over to their families for burial.</p>
<p>The "Black Guard" is still under orders to prepare for incidents, but all is quiet at the moment. Hitler's plan does not seem to be causing any backlash. (Reuters Telegram, 1st)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Secret police are very active last night, searching house to house and arresting rebellious party members. Hundreds of people throughout Germany have been detained in detention centers, but their names have not been announced. It is reported that the authorities have seized many documents, so they are well aware of the content of the conspiracy. It is feared that many more people will be arrested.

<p>(Berlin) Rumors that the list of those executed on Sunday contained as many as a dozen names, including Vice-Chancellor's trusted aide Boss. It is also rumored that over two hundred Stormtroopers leaders have been arrested nationwide. The situation in Berlin on the surface is no different from usual. Chancellor Hitler is currently handling the reorganization of the National Socialist Party in his office, especially the reorganization of the party army.

<p>(Berlin) Although authorities claim that only seventeen people have been executed so far, it is believed that as many as sixty people have died. Several more people will be executed this week. Currently, the Black Guard telephones headquarters every hour to ask if there are any matters to handle. Stormtroopers members who are allowed to wear uniforms are issued special permits; the rest have been arrested. Security at the airfield is particularly tight. According to a passenger who arrived at Croydon Airport in the United Kingdom today, at Tempelhof Airport, two passengers who intended to take a plane were waiting for the plane when two men in plainclothes suddenly came and asked them where they were going. They replied that they intended to go to Amsterdam. They were unwilling to go with the men in plainclothes to the office for questioning until the men in plainclothes</p>

<p>The Hague According to news obtained here, people are secretly distributing "Declarations to the German People" in major German cities, the wording of which is very strong. The content briefly states that Hitler has directed party members to commit many injustices in Germany. Now, as he persists in evil and refuses to repent, internal killings have begun. Hitler is primarily responsible for this, as these villains were all promoted by Hitler and given key positions. Their various brutal acts were all approved and permitted by Hitler. Hitler punishing these people with death is tantamount to announcing his own death, as the entire Hitler regime is based on these villains and their sinful and shameless actions. The declaration concludes by urging the German people to loudly denounce and rise up against Hitler and his heinous regime. (Havas Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times published an editorial commenting on the German incident, briefly stating, "In a country filled with spies to monitor the people, and the actions of its government are unknown to the people, innocent people can be arrested and executed at any time without any explanation.

<p>The French Government Remains Silent</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the events in Berlin and Munich, all of French public opinion has been in a state of shock and disbelief. All other matters have become secondary news. However, the government has remained completely silent, stating that all changes are internal matters for Germany. Political circles, however, are rife with speculation about the future of the Sturmabteilung (SA). Some newspapers believe it is a strike by Hitler against the left, while others say it is a strike against both left and right. In any case, there is no organization in defection or betrayal. Le Petit Parisien, however, says that Hitler remains an undoubtedly supreme leader and that the National Socialist movement, which has survived for seventeen months, has safely passed its first most critical difficulty. The result is the swift and thorough nature of this purge. Furthermore, it cannot be denied that the personal dangers of Hitler and Prussian Prime Minister Göring have been completely cleared. Other newspapers, such as L'Écho de Paris, Le Journal, and Le Journal de Paris, all believe that since Germany has suffered this kind of disaster, French foreign policy will be somewhat negatively affected. Therefore, the German SA may be dissolved or reduced, and France will inevitably lose its main argument on arms reduction. Le Journal also said that after the German incident, no matter from what perspective, political circles feel it is quite unfavorable to France. Therefore, what France will contend with in the future will be a more rational Germany, and the argument that France and Britain once fought the most fiercely will lose its effectiveness. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The afternoon editions of Paris newspapers all carry lengthy commentaries on the recent events in Germany. Although there is much chaos in the news coming from Germany, the newspapers are very cautious in their comments. However, the general criticism is quite incisive. For example, Qingyi Bao [Public Opinion News] says that no matter what kind of trick Hitler is playing behind the scenes, the main victory should belong to the Reichswehr. After experiencing various hardships, Germany may return to the old ways of nationalism. Le Temps regards the incident as an unprecedented and extraordinary change in history. The impressions gained from the incident are still chaotic, but one thing is certain: the National Socialist system can no longer maintain its unity. Hitler has been securing himself with a kind of mysterious power, but this mysterious power is on the verge of bankruptcy due to the crisis of the National Socialist chairman, reaching its most acute and profound degree yesterday. Therefore, whether Hitler can maintain his position in the future is truly a question. L'Intransigeant says that in the chaotic situation in Germany last month, the deposed Crown Prince must be privately pleased, thinking that the time he had been waiting for has arrived, and that Germany will restore the monarchy.

Most of the news is relayed to the deposed German Emperor by the Associated Press.

British newspapers have reported the entire incident in detail. However, because Hitler has announced to the German people, and Göring has issued a statement to foreign reporters, British people's hearts have been greatly calmed.

Among the incidents, there are three key points that the British are most happy to talk about: first, Hitler's bold and decisive measures, coupled with meticulous and detailed planning, were able to wipe out dangerous elements all at once; second, the unanimous support of the German people for Hitler seems to be an irrefutable fact; and third, there are no signs of unrest in other places.

Only those who feel their power is gradually slipping away will take such a quick, decisive, and shocking approach. The Daily Express calls this a bloody move, saying that National Socialism will disappear from now on. However, the Daily Mail says that the position of the Hitler government is now stable. The Times says that Hitler's methods are interpreted differently, but judging from Hitler's own explanation, he really wants to raise the standards of National Socialist personnel to serve the public and change the revolutionary atmosphere into a moderate and constructive effort. Italian public opinion believes that Hitler is a man of strong will, while Moscow accuses Hitler of being a puppet of industrialists. People in Paris are quite concerned that the turmoil in Germany will make Europe more troubled.

<p>— One of the Mysteries of the German Incident</p>
<p>(Berlin) Propaganda Minister Goebbels praised Hitler for his personal strength in quelling the rebellion, saying that his courage and determination are commendable. Goebbels said that since Saturday, Hitler's party has been great and the foundation of Germany has been solid. Hitler is truly an outstanding person. Sturmabteilung Chief of Staff Röhm was Hitler's first friend. He was the only one among Hitler's associates who could address him as "you and I." This time, Hitler actually executed him by firing squad, which is impossible without an iron heart. Hitler originally planned to give a speech to the public yesterday or today, but as of now, it has not been carried out. At sunset, police guarded the front of the Prime Minister's office, prohibiting pedestrians from lingering, because Hitler had told the police guarding the door that he did not want to be disturbed while he was working. The internal situation in Germany is not very clear. The scene in Berlin has not changed much, but the faces of passers-by seem to reflect the deep impressions of the recent incident on the people. However, the German people know most of the political changes from the newspapers, and the incident happened suddenly, so the average person seems to be at a loss. Most of the official announcements expose obscene matters, so that some people who were respected the day before are now disgraced and despised for their depraved morals. One thing that people cannot understand is that on the night when a riot was about to occur in the city of Munich, the mastermind was still indulging in pleasure in a villa a few kilometers away from the city, which is quite perplexing. Vice-Chancellor Papen is now under surveillance, and his close associates have been killed. Former Prime Minister Schleicher, who participated in the conspiracy, has also died. What is the relationship between these conspirators? The so-called mutual collusion mentioned in the official announcements is still a strange thing in the eyes of the public. If Goebbels said that this cruel incident was a warning to those who criticize the current system, wouldn't the exposure of various scandals by senior National Socialist officials provide new material for critics? One or two people commented on this matter, saying that before the National Socialist Party took power, Germany had implemented social democracy for fifteen years, and the government had never had an accident that could be compared to today's events. Now the German people are all silent, but we dare not take this as a sign of the people's trust in the government, nor do we dare to believe that Hitler's position in Germany has been further consolidated. Dissatisfaction with politics cannot be stopped by severe punishment. The situation in Germany after the incident is still the same as before the incident. Social and economic difficulties still exist, and all Germans believe that Hitler's harsh measures have created a political crisis, adding another difficulty to Germany's original difficulties. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Brussels: Yesterday, the information office of the German National Socialist Party issued an official announcement, detailing the immoral behavior of the Sturmabteilung leaders. This evening's local newspapers commented on it, saying that it is the first time that a government has allowed such obscene and unspeakable news to be published in official documents, which makes it easy to see what the private morals of the people in important positions in Germany are like, and there is no way to hide it. Moreover, the shocking act is not just one thing, such as the various facts stated in the National Socialist Party's information. Prime Minister Hitler, who has always trusted Röhm, even said that Röhm's morals are disgraced. The simultaneous occurrence of rebellion, immoral behavior, and anti-revolutionary conspiracies, in short, even the ugliest history of the German Empire, as far as we can remember, has never been so shocking. It is unexpected that the National Socialist Party's achievements in promoting a model life for the past year have come to this. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>

Among the four cruisers planned to be built, one is equipped with 8-inch guns, which the London Treaty stipulates can only be built after January 1935. The other three cruisers are equipped with 6-inch guns. Among the fourteen destroyers, two have a displacement of 1,850 tons each, and twelve have a displacement of 1,500 tons each. The six submarines have a total displacement of approximately 1,500 tons. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Japanese Demands at the Naval Conference <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>5|5|4.39 Ratio</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the Washington Star, Japan plans to propose a request at the 1935 naval conference to change the current naval ratio of 5 (British) 5 (American) 3 (Japanese) to a ratio of 5 (British) 5 (American) 4.39 (Japanese). The total tonnage is 655,000 tons, a reduction of 111,000 tons. The total tonnage of the United States is 746,000 tons, a reduction of 44,000 tons. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the Washington Star, Japan plans to request a modification of the 5·5·3 ratio to a 5·5·4·39 ratio at the 1935 naval conference. The report also stated that Japan is demanding that the United States focus on the abolition of aircraft carriers and the reduction of the number of armored battleships, reducing them from 15 to 11. If so, Japan can also abolish one armored battleship, reducing its total number to eight. Regarding cruisers, according to the Washington Naval Treaty, the United States can have eight 10,000-ton cruisers equipped with 8-inch guns, and Japan can have twelve similar cruisers. Japan now proposes to reduce the number of these warships, with the United States having twelve and Japan having ten. Also, according to the London Naval Agreement, the United States can have 143,000 tons of light cruisers equipped with 6-inch guns, and Japan can have 104,450 tons. Japan now proposes that both countries increase to 150,000 tons. Regarding torpedo boats, according to the London Naval Agreement, the United States has 150,000 tons and Japan has 105,000 tons. Now Japan demands equal rights in the number of these ships, with both countries set at 150,000 tons. Regarding submarines, Japan regards them as purely defensive weapons and therefore demands that the United States and Japan should each have 75,000 tons, compared to the 52,000 tons each stipulated by the London Agreement. The Washington Star also stated that it is absolutely impossible for Japan to have these demands accepted by the United States and Britain. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to a source, French raw silk traders have recently reached an agreement with Italian raw silk traders regarding the expansion of Japanese raw silk in the French market. Italian raw silk will be dumped on the French market for three months. If the result cannot prevent Japanese raw silk, France will restrict the import of Japanese raw silk. In addition, the price France pays for the dumping of Italian raw silk is that Italy guarantees the import of certain French-made goods. If this agreement is realized, Japan will be greatly hit, so the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other related parties are paying great attention to it. (Dentsu News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e59">Meeting of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party closed here after discussing the following two issues: one was the completion of the plan for the payment of grains and meat, and the other was to find ways to improve the Soviet Union's animal husbandry.</p>
<p>The resolution on the first issue pointed out that the success of spring planting was determined by the development and improvement of collective farming organizations, as well as the dramatic increase in the labor discipline and creativity of collective farmers. The spring planting work exceeded the plan and was completed earlier than in previous years. The quality of various agricultural works has been greatly improved. Although there is some drought in the southern part of the country, all parties indicate that this year's harvest will not be inferior to 1933. In some areas, it may even be better than last year. The resolution also listed specific steps to ensure that the plan for paying grains and meat to the state is completed on schedule.</p>
<p>The resolution on the second issue pointed out that the large-scale animal husbandry work carried out in state-owned, collective, and special commodity crop farms in recent years has become the main basis for improving this industry. Great progress has been made in supplying collective farmers with cows who originally had no cows. However, the general animal husbandry business is still not satisfactory. The conference instructed the government to plan to develop the cattle industry in various republics, regions, and localities. The resolution also listed several specific steps for state-owned and collective farms to carry out animal husbandry, and suggested that in 1934, the state should expand its assistance to farmers who do not have cows by using the method of purchasing and distributing young calves, so that by the end of this year, collective farmers can obtain 2 million calves in addition to the 900,000 heads that have already been distributed. At the same time, interest-free loans of 70 million rubles should be increased to collective farmers to achieve this goal. The resolution also listed various preferential treatments that collective farmers engaged in animal husbandry can enjoy in increasing horses, improving livestock, and producing purebred cattle.

<h3 id="e60">Cause of This Year's Drought and Heat <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Sudden Increase in Pacific Air Pressure</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Central Meteorological Research Institute, the drought and heat in Nanjing in June were unprecedented in decades. The average rainfall in June is 167 millimeters, but this year it is 32.1 millimeters, only slightly less than one-fifth. Shanghai is now 48.2 millimeters, only slightly more than one-quarter of the previous year. In addition, the average temperature in Nanjing in June is 24.3 degrees Celsius, but this year it is 25.9 degrees. Shanghai is also 25.1 degrees, both being the hottest Junes since the sixth year of the Guangxu Emperor. The reason for this year's drought and heat is that the Pacific air pressure south of Japan has suddenly increased, and the low pressure has been driven to the Yellow River basin, causing the southwest wind to prevail in the air over the Yangtze River area.

<p>New Trends in European Diplomacy (German Correspondence)</p>
<p>Poland as the Center</p>
<p>After the intensification of the conflict between the Franco-Soviet alliance and military equality and "security guarantees," the entire Europe has returned to the complex situation of the past. Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations was intended to use Italy's power to break the Versailles system and to win over the Little Entente countries to expand the power of Germany. France rejected Britain's proposal and insisted on its "security guarantee" proposal. Germany opposed this, and Italy did not approve it. Germany and Poland also established a non-aggression treaty at the beginning of this year, and the Versailles system developed cracks. France's plan to encircle Germany was frustrated and felt threatened in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, French Foreign Minister Barthou went to Warsaw. When he arrived in Warsaw on April 22, he met with Marshal Pilsudski. The next day, they had another two-hour discussion. From Germany's perspective, Barthou's visit to Warsaw had the following three purposes:</p>
<p>(1) To reaffirm the Franco-Polish alliance of 1921.</p>
<p>(2) To coordinate with the Soviet Union at the Geneva Disarmament Conference at the end of May to restrain the attempts of both Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>(3) Related to the above two items is the gradual deterioration of the economic relations between France and Poland over the years, and efforts should be made to improve them in the future.</p>
<p>Speaking of the first item, it is what France pays special attention to. When Poland and the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression treaty in 1932, this treaty caused quite a bit of displeasure in France at the time, but it did not cause any fatal blow to France. However, this spring's German-Polish treaty is different. If the German-Polish treaty really means non-aggression, even if there are no secret documents, there are two worrying situations. The first is to allow Germany to focus on the Western Front without worrying about the East. The second is that if an understanding is reached between Germany and Poland, the opportunity may come to jointly attack the Soviet Union and expand its power. This is what France fears, and it is also what the Soviet Union is particularly wary of. Therefore, French Foreign Minister Barthou directly inquired about the secret German-Polish agreement with Marshal Piłsudski, who replied, "The German-Polish treaty allows Poland complete freedom of action, so Poland fulfills the obligations assigned to it by the Franco-Polish alliance with full sincerity." This answer made Barthou very relieved. At this moment, although it cannot make Germany and Poland sever ties and completely listen to France's command, France does not have to worry too much about the deterioration of this problem. However, the Soviet Union is very uneasy about Germany, fearing that after the close relationship between Germany and Poland, the threat felt in the western Soviet Union will be even greater than that of France, because Germany can use anti-Sovietism as an excuse to gain the sympathy of European powers. Therefore, the Soviet Union is very vigilant about this. As a result, the Franco-Soviet alliance has begun, and a major change has taken place in the European diplomatic situation.</p>
<p>If the understanding between Britain and France at the Geneva Arms Reduction Conference cannot be established, everyone who understands the European situation knows very well whether the meeting will be fruitful. However, since Britain and Germany are close to each other, France's situation is particularly difficult. Therefore, it has to win over the Soviet Union and promote it very highly in order to reverse the centrifugal tendencies of various small countries. It is also trying its best to deal with Poland.</p>
<p>After staying in Warsaw for three days, Barthou went to Prague (the capital of Czechoslovakia) to meet with Czech President Masaryk and Prime Minister Benes to discuss the peace issues of Eastern and Central Europe (including the Balkans). As a result, they naturally followed France's lead. On the surface, they said they were maintaining European peace, but in reality, they were weakening Germany's diplomatic power and making it fall into isolation again. On the other hand, it has promoted the international relations between the Soviet Union and the Little Entente. In Eastern Europe, it may even be possible to achieve a considerable period of stability as a result. The hegemony of France can also be consolidated a lot. However, Poland is still unwilling to sincerely throw itself into France's arms. It will make full use of its important position to maneuver between the Franco-Soviet-German triangle relationship. The alliance between the Soviet Union and France may also increase its chances of being established as a result. (May 20, 1934, Berlin)</p>
<p>Concretization of Japanese Economic Aggression (Changchun Correspondence)</p>
<p>Two Major Policies to Control Manchurian Economy</p>
<p>Massive investment in industry, mining, and transportation</p>
<p>Under the iron hooves of the Japanese army, the people of the three northeastern provinces have no room to resist with non-violent economic organizations. Japan has built 2,868 kilometers of automobile roads. These automobile roads are not built for economic development but contain extremely serious military implications. Furthermore, it has prepared a large capital of 141 million Japanese yen to build seven major railways. These routes also have very significant military relations. With these tools, Japan can further carry out its so-called Japan-Manchuria controlled economy. At present, Japan has four major policies to control the economy of "Manchukuo," of which the most important are only two items: (1) It is to develop and exploit resources and encourage industries. In this, they use a clever method, saying "open door, equal opportunity" to lure the powers, and at the same time, they really divide certain benefits among investing countries. However, in fact, Japan is still the main body, but it is only using this as a diplomatic excuse. (2) It is to integrate the East Asian economy, first make "Manchukuo" and Japan become one, and cooperate with Japan as the center. Of course, this is a variant of Japanese control. Puppet states and puppet capitalists are in a subordinate position, and there is absolutely no possibility of freely managing industries.</p>
<p>Japan also uses a special method, which is the combination of the state and capital. All important economic sectors within the three northeastern provinces are using the so-called state control as a means. "We know that this country is not a pseudonym for puppets. The Kwantung Army Headquarters is more for actively preparing for war against the Soviet Union than for this type of business to have a public welfare nature because Japan does not treat the people of Northeast China as human beings. Even for the Japanese in Northeast China, there is no such thing as public welfare. Even if there is, it is just a deceiving signboard, and it still focuses on military preparations."</p>
<p>Let us try to take the South Manchurian Railway, which Japan is extremely keen to operate, as an example. Now, the main responsible relationship for this business is that the dispute between the Kwantung Army and the Japanese government has not been completely resolved, and the power of the South Manchurian Railway is still very large. As for the companies under the South Manchurian Railway, they can be divided into four categories. The first is that all shares are owned by the South Manchurian Railway, and the Japanese call them directly affiliated companies. This type of industry not only has the implication of economic aggression but also has military relations, such as Dalian Steamship Company, which is a transportation agency in wartime, such as Japan-Manchuria Warehouse, which is an operation for storing military equipment, such as Showa Steel Works, which supplements the deficiencies of Yawata Steel Works, etc. All eleven other companies have the same meaning. In particular, the Manchuria Daily is a propaganda machine for anesthetizing people. The second is that more than 50% of the shares are owned by the South Manchurian Railway, that is, the so-called South Manchurian Railway's affiliated companies. However, this type of operation is still centered on the military. At present, the most severe is the controlled economic theory, which is highly advocated like clouds, such as the Man-Mongolian Woolen Textile Factory producing military uniform materials, such as Dalian Oil and Fats and Toyo Nitrogen, producing raw materials for explosives and poison gas. These are strictly supervised by the Kwantung Army Headquarters and are actively preparing. The remaining companies whose shares are owned by the South Manchurian Railway are less than 50% or less than 3% are not very important, but they are gradually trending towards military industry.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan also has very detailed investment plans. Now, let's not talk about commercial and agricultural investment. Let's just talk about industrial, mining, and transportation industry investment, which can prove the seriousness of the problem. According to statistics from the Bank of Korea, the industrial investment plan last year was 93,410,000 Japanese yen, and this year's industrial investment is 106,825,000 Japanese yen. Mining investment was 8,599,000 Japanese yen last year, and this year it has increased to 8,819,000 Japanese yen. Transportation industry investment was 352,041,000 Japanese yen last year, and this year it has increased to 477,418,000 Japanese yen. It can be seen from this that it is not just a business plan. What we should pay special attention to here is the economic aggression aspect. It controls the so-called Central Bank of Manchuria and expands the equipment of the air force. It also controls the Manchurian Airlines. In the name of this company, it sets up large-scale airfields in many important places. It also reopens the Fengtian Arsenal and uses this type of second-rate military equipment to supply the puppet army that is disrupting Guan Nei. It also develops oil mines and wants to get unexpected gains. Under the iron hooves, the people of Northeast China are also working hard to struggle and seek their own survival.

<p>Financial Relief in Fujian Province</p>
<p>The Finance Department Proposes Four Measures</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Xu Fu, Director of the Finance Department, went to Beijing last month to participate in the National Finance Conference and went to Nanchang to meet with Chairman Chiang to state the social and economic depression in Fujian Province, the difficulties in local finance, and relief measures. Xu has now returned to Fujian from Jiangxi via Shanghai by boat on the 21st of this month. In addition to the 50,000 yuan increase in the monthly subsidy approved by the Executive Yuan in finance (the original amount was 250,000 yuan), four measures are also planned to relieve social finance and will be implemented in order to gradually restore the countryside and the business community. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) Establish a local bank to be responsible for discretionary surpluses. The fundraising methods are divided into two types: First, issue valuable securities and obtain funds from the Central Bank to consolidate the bank's foundation. Second, issue fixed-term relief coupons to circulate in the market to demonstrate the bank's effectiveness. However, although this bank is founded by the government, it must go beyond the scope of ordinary politics and maintain independence so as not to be controlled by the government and can establish a backbone among the people. (2) Promote rural cooperatives to set up farmers' lending offices to break the bad habits of separation and monopoly. For farmers who are unable to purchase seeds or improve farming, the farmers' lending offices will assess their needs and provide loans separately and can transport and sell the goods they produce on their behalf. With a single transfer, agricultural production will inevitably increase, and funds will be easier to circulate. (3) Improve the habit of merchants borrowing and mortgaging. Merchants in Fujian Province have always valued personal credit, which is different from modern methods of using credit on goods, leading to increasingly frequent collapses. Now, real estate mortgages should be adopted, or warehouse receipts should be mortgaged, or foreign exchange should be mortgaged, or formal term bills should be discounted so that credit can be maintained and commerce can be developed. (4) Strictly prohibit private individuals from issuing banknotes in various places to avoid occasional collapses. The local bank will set up branches or agencies in prosperous market towns in various counties to issue banknotes in order to plan unity. According to Xu's observation, the most important thing is to raise sufficient funds to establish a local bank, which is the general hub for relieving finance in Fujian Province, followed by transporting and selling rural products, lending farmers' capital, and improving credit mortgages so that the entire province's economy can be revived from depletion, and the national tax revenue can also be increased through cultivation.

At this National Finance Conference, it was revealed to rescue the countryside and abolish exorbitant taxes. The Hubei Provincial Government ordered the Finance Department to make practical plans to thoroughly abolish local taxes to clear the administration and relieve people's suffering. After receiving the order, the Finance Department drafted a plan to eliminate 27 types of donations and taxes, reducing more than 280,000 yuan annually. The plan was submitted to the provincial government for approval and was scheduled to be implemented on July 1, and it was also requested to be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for record. The Finance Department's report is recorded as follows: According to the investigation, Hubei Province's finances, in terms of provincial local donations and taxes, only include six types: field tax, deed tax, business tax, slaughter tax, broker tax, and pawn tax. The fixed rate of field tax is low, and it is still based on the old practice. The fixed rate of deed tax has long been reduced from selling at 9.6% to selling at 4.6%. Therefore, the provincial tax system is in line with central laws and regulations, and there are no exorbitant taxes. The old market taxes of Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang have also been improved separately and are gradually in line with the principles of taxation. The only vestiges of exorbitant donations and taxes that have not been eliminated are the county income of various counties and the expense taxes of the public security bureaus of various commercial ports outside the province. Yichang, Shashi, Xindi, Wuxue, Laohekou, Fancheng, Shayang, and other seven ports are either important towns in Hubei Province or prosperous commercial areas. In the past, they were designated as ordinary cities, and public security bureaus were established in each. The expenses were generally raised locally, and the public security bureaus collected and used them themselves. Therefore, the donation items involved exorbitant taxes, and the implementation system was not clear. The name of the city was later canceled, and the public security bureaus were changed to be directly under the jurisdiction of the Civil Affairs Department. The income and expenditure of expenses did not belong to the province or the county. According to the principle of unified finance, it seemed inappropriate. After consultation with the Civil Affairs Department, it was reported and approved to transfer the original donations and taxes levied by the public security bureaus to the Business Tax Bureau for collection. The period from March to the end of June of this year was the reorganization period, and after July 1, the elimination period was implemented. The original tax items were divided into three items: should be eliminated, should be merged, and should be handled, and a list was submitted for verification. It is now planned to eliminate the tax items, a total of 27 types, with a total donation amount of 280,000 yuan. A separate table will be submitted for verification. This is the situation of first eliminating the exorbitant taxes in Yichang and other commercial ports. As for the local income of various counties, although the additional donations only involve items such as field tax, deed tax, and broker tax, the items are complicated, including education, autonomy, police, public security, election, party affairs defense, rural cleaning, provincial and county seat guards, political police, dike construction, infant care, charity, and other donations. Other miscellaneous expenses are also collected for one thing, that is, a donation is collected, such as grain, rice, piece goods, superstition, local tobacco, burning and boiling, kiln industry, tea pressing, cotton, silk flowers, salted eggs, cattle, horses, mules, fish, pigs, sheep, boats, rowing wheels, barges, bamboo, wood, vehicles, calendars, gentry, shops, public welfare, and other donations are also collected in parallel. The general situation of exorbitant taxes in various counties is generally exhausted in this. After the promulgation of the ban on abolishing taxes last year, the above-mentioned taxes on goods have been abolished in accordance with the regulations, and the complex additional donation items in the past have also been simplified. Due to the needs of affairs, they have been classified and sorted out, and each county's political education and two donations have been determined. Among them, the national allocations have not yet been settled. I have to keep one or two miscellaneous donations and continue to collect them for relief. I am now strictly reviewing and compiling all the elimination situations in the county's local budget for the 23rd year in accordance with the resolutions of the Finance Conference and will report them in another case. This is the situation of actively eliminating exorbitant taxes in various counties. At this Finance Conference, attention was paid to local finances, and the development of the national economy and the cultivation of tax sources were the most urgent tasks. Hubei Province's existing local donations and taxes should be selected and gradually eliminated to support the central government's main purpose of reducing people's suffering and restoring the rural economy. All the circumstances of Hubei Province's first elimination of exorbitant tax items should be attached with a detailed table and submitted to Your Excellency for verification, and it is hoped that it will be reported to the Ministry of Finance for record, which is convenient for the public. As for the eliminated donations and taxes, there are 27 types in total, including the Yichang pig and sheep donation, green fruit donation, large wheel donation, small wheel donation, lamp donation, Shashi various business license fees, shop donation, Xindi wheel ticket additional donation, local subsidy fee, shop donation, Wuxue shop donation, slaughter additional donation, grain and rice donation, hemp velvet donation, tobacco leaf donation, beef donation, grocery donation, boat donation, small wheel donation, brand wine donation, assistance fee, Laohekou six-cent donation, salt donation, freight donation, Fancheng freight donation, business donation, brand donation, Shayang door donation, fish trade donation, paddle donation, and subsidy fee, with a total donation amount of 286,896 yuan.

<p>Communist Bandits Flock to Surrender</p>
<p>Lack of Food is a Fatal Injury</p>
<p>National Army's Accommodation Policy is Effective</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the National Army recovered the bandit areas such as Junmenling, the internal bandit side was very panicked, especially the lack of food and the cutoff of supplies, which was a fatal injury. Recently, the bandit crowds fled one after another. Yesterday, Xiong Chinong, a senior staff officer of the pseudo Guangdong-Jiangxi Military Region, carried a ruler pistol and surrendered to the 1st Regiment stationed in Zhongshi. The pseudo staff officer was escorted to the 1st Division Headquarters by the regiment. It was said that the division headquarters slightly inquired and sent personnel to the military headquarters for favorable disposition.</p>
<p>Also, Leping News: Zheng Jingfu, the magistrate of Leping County, led the Volunteer Army on the 10th of this month to capture an important bandit leader in Gaojia Village, Mentian, the fifth district of the county. According to the confession, his name is Zhang Sende, a native of Fuliang. He served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Leping Pseudo County Soviet, Director of the General Affairs Office, and Secretary-General, with the special privilege of dispatching various troops. Recently, due to the establishment of accommodation centers in Zhongbu Street, the people in the bandit area fled out, like water flowing down, and could not be contained. Since the bandit force was besieged, it was already exhausted and unable to resist the National Army. What it relied on to survive was to deceive the people and make false claims. Now that the people are scattered, the bandit platform is actually turned upside down. Fang Zhimin, a bandit, was greatly alarmed by this situation and convened a meeting of the Northeast Jiangxi Red Curtain, deciding to break the National Army's accommodation policy. Therefore, there was an attack on the Zhongbu Street accommodation center last time, but the people's hearts were scattered, and the number of failures was said to be many. The bandit will be escorted to the province for trial within a few days. It can be seen from this that one of the signs of the collapse of the internal Red Army. (June 28)</p>
<p>Deng Longguang's Troops Destroy Ancient Bandit Hideout</p>
<p>Pseudo Chief of Staff Lu Ducheng Captured</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Independent 4th Division of Deng Longguang was ordered to clear the remnants of the ancient Da Cun troops in Fengshun. On June 7, it transferred the Pan Biao and Tang Fu Regiments to Fengshun and attacked the bandit nest in Baxiang Mountain. On the 11th, the Pan Regiment surrounded the Lu Ducheng Department of the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Squadrons of the bandits in Ximao Ao Sheng, Jieyang. In the evening, the entire bandit group was resolved, and three machine guns and more than 50 long and short guns were seized. A bandit squadron leader, a military doctor, and more than 20 male and female bandits were captured. After Lu was defeated, he hid in a stone rock in the mountain. On the 15th, he disguised himself as a farmer, carrying a hoe and wearing a hat, and fled to Dayang Village. The Pan Regiment found out and sent a team to surround and capture him. He was captured on the 19th and escorted to the Tangkeng Division Headquarters. Lu was 32 years old, a native of Xin'an, Puning. He used to be a teacher at Puning Girls' High School and a member of the Businessmen's Association. He is now the chief of staff of the ancient bandits. According to the bandit register, Lu joined the bandit party in the 18th year of the Republic. Because he was familiar with the local conditions in the Chaozhou-Puning-Jieyang area, he gained the trust of the ancient bandits. He was originally the commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Bandit East River Independent Division. In April of this year, he was reorganized into the 1st Brigade, and Lu was promoted to chief of staff. The ancient bandits served as political instructors. The bandits who rioted in Puning and Jieyang were all led by Lu. Zhang Ruigui once offered a reward of 5,000 yuan to capture him. He is now imprisoned at the Tangkeng Division Headquarters and is said to be treated very well. (23rd)</p>

<p>Zhengda Bank on Jiangxi Road in this city, initially organized by Shanghai financial magnates Wang Yiting, Sun Bosheng, Yu Zhendong, and others, is now expanding its business scope. A general shareholders' meeting was held at the Bankers Association a few days ago. Eighty-seven shareholders attended, representing over 1,400 shares, exceeding the legal quorum. The meeting commenced immediately, with Wu Zhihao publicly elected as the interim chairman. He reported the meeting's purpose, followed by a report from Manager Zheng Wenzhi on the bank's progress. Subsequently, Sun Bosheng, Yu Zhendong, Wang Wenzhi, Wang Yaochen, Wang Yiting, Zhu Yanqing, Ye Gongshan, Wu Hongshi, Ding Fangzhen, and others were re-elected as directors, with Peng Xingsheng and Gao Peiliang as supervisors. The original location was deemed insufficient for development, so a new location has been secured in the Tongji Lane Building on Tianjin Road. Renovations are actively underway to facilitate a swift relocation and commencement of business. It is also heard that the bank has formulated various new plans to benefit customers, which are expected to be endorsed by all sectors. It is anticipated that the new location will usher in a new era upon its opening.</p>
<p>Mei Huaquan's Mother Passes Away</p>
<p>Madam Fang, the mother of renowned lawyer Mei Huaquan of this city, resided in New York, USA, for many years. Throughout her life, she showed meticulous care and concern for overseas Chinese and students in the United States, earning her the reputation of a compassionate mother. Last summer, despite her advanced age, Madam Fang made a special trip from the United States to return to China, delighting in the presence of her children and grandchildren. Unfortunately, she contracted a minor illness last winter and was bedridden at the residence of her son-in-law, Li Yunkai. Relatives, close friends, and doctors provided attentive care, but her advanced age and weakened heart, exacerbated by the recent heat, caused her condition to deteriorate rapidly. She passed away peacefully on the morning of the day of this month, Sunday, at 3:00 AM, at the age of sixty-six. Her remains were moved to the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. The encoffining ceremony is scheduled for today, Tuesday, at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Xu Baosheng Drowns Himself in the Huangpu River - Suicide Note Mentions Worsening Illnesses and Ridicule from Relatives</p>
<p>At approximately 2:00 PM yesterday, a small ferry belonging to Longmao Foreign Firm was carrying passengers from the Guangdong Road pier back to Pudong. As it approached the center of the Huangpu River, a passenger, appearing to be about 27 or 28 years old, wearing a singlet and white trousers, suddenly jumped into the river. He left behind a white short-sleeved shirt, a piece of twill cloth, a pair of old eyeglasses, and two letters (intended for delivery to newspapers). The ferry's captain, Xia Abao, noticed the incident and immediately reversed the engine to attempt a rescue. However, the man briefly resurfaced before sinking again, making rescue impossible. The captain handed over the belongings to the Customs Water Police Station. The contents of the suicide note generally stated, "Unfortunately, on the evening of June 27th in the Gregorian calendar, at 9:30 PM," I saw that my home suddenly caught fire at No. 28, Shanle Lane, Julu Road in the French Concession, which belonged to the Xu Wenrong Rattan Company. Within an hour, it was reduced to ashes, causing losses of about ten thousand yuan. I have been living at my brother's house for a year. My illness was gradually improving, but I lost sleep all night because of my brother's house fire, which caused me to catch a cold, and my old illnesses relapsed. These include coughing, lung disease, stomach issues, hemorrhoids, and tremors. These ailments are harder to bear than death itself. To recover, I must be hospitalized, etc." The final part described how a relative, Li, refused to help and instead ridiculed him, causing the death of another person, and so on. The end of the letter was signed Xu Baosheng. The police chief ordered that family members be notified to identify the belongings.</p>
<p>Brick Boat Capsizes in Heavy Waves - Two Girls Die Tragically</p>
<p>Liu Ruwei, the owner of a kiln cargo boat, loaded 24,000 bricks around 6:00 PM the night before and set sail in the Huangpu River. As he passed near the Taikoo Dock in Pudong, he turned to head towards Puxi. Unexpectedly, due to the heavy load, upon reaching the center of the river, a large wave crashed into the cabin, instantly capsizing the entire boat and cargo to the bottom of the river. A total of twelve people, adults and children, fell into the water. Nearby boats rushed to the rescue, managing to save ten adults. However, Liu's two daughters, whose names are, sank and drowned. Their bodies drifted away and their whereabouts are unknown. After being rescued, Liu reported the incident to the Customs Water Police Station that night.</p>

<p>Various Fellow Countrymen Association News:</p>
<p>Wuyuan: The Wuyuan Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai has established an office at No. 117 Fangbang Road to handle the case against being劃歸 under the jurisdiction of 省. In addition to Zheng Jianyuan (Economic Affairs), Yu Zufeng (Document Affairs), Cha Zhengren (Public Relations), and Song Lixin (General Affairs) being responsible for all related matters, Zhu Fengchi, Yu Xiji, Jin Ji　, Wang Weiying, Jiang Lunan, Jin Chichen, Yu Yanghan, and Yu Jianhu, were publicly elected to be in charge of handling the affairs. It is reported that the association is scheduled to hold a joint meeting at the Huining Guild Hall on July 4th, and has sent letters to the Anhui and Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Associations and the Huining Guild Hall to invite representatives to participate and provide guidance. According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Wuyuan Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai, in opposition to Wuyuan County being placed under the jurisdiction of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, believes that Wuyuan has a long-standing cultural relationship with Anhui and is difficult to separate. They have scheduled a reception for the press at 6:00 PM on July 4th at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant on Park Road, Bake Road, seeking their support.</p>
<p>Huining: The Huining Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Central Political Council, the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Chiang, urging them to respect public opinion and refrain from changing the jurisdiction of Wuyuan Province. The telegram stated, "To the Central Political Council, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Chiang of the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters: We have read in recent reports that Chairman Chiang, in order to facilitate the suppression of bandits, sent a letter to the Executive Yuan to place Wuyuan County in Anhui Province and Guangze County in Fujian Province under the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province, instructing the respective provincial governments to hand over and receive them, and that this has been decided. Furthermore, we have received letters from various public bodies in Wuyuan County and the Wuyuan Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai, stating the reasons and listing the deep relationship between Wuyuan and Anhui, and based on politics, culture, and livelihood, it is practically impossible to place them under the jurisdiction of Jiangxi. We urge you to jointly appeal to retract the order and refrain from changing the jurisdiction, in order to comply with public opinion, etc. After deliberation, we have found that Wuyuan County has been under the jurisdiction of Anhui since　until now, for over a thousand years without any changes. The customs, language, and habits are very different from Jiangxi, with little connection. A sudden change would be extremely difficult. Moreover, the people of Wuyuan are gentle and mild, and their interaction with the people of Anhui is similar, with a long and deep history. There would be no political problems. As for the suppression of bandits, Chairman Chiang, as commander-in-chief, has unified Anhui and Jiangxi, making military operations extremely convenient, and command would not be difficult. After silently observing the situation, this association is deeply concerned that placing the county under the jurisdiction of Jiangxi would inevitably lead to numerous disputes and unrest among the people. Therefore, based on the points raised by various legal entities in Wuyuan and the actual difficulties in changing the jurisdiction to Jiangxi, we are telegraphing the facts and earnestly requesting your review, respecting public opinion, and approving the retraction of the order to refrain from changing the jurisdiction, in order to appease public sentiment. We are extremely anxious to await your instructions. The Huining Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai kowtows."</p>

<p>Yangzhong: The Yangzhong Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai held a committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Dai Zhonghong was publicly elected as chairman. He reported on the recent progress of the association's affairs and the exchange of letters and telegrams with various parties. Then, the following were discussed: (1) The Yangzhong County Government's public notice regarding the budget for the 23rd year stated that the portion of revenue from land tax and county tax was 84,624 yuan, and that the various surtaxes exceeding three times the regular tax would still be levied as before, without any reduction. This not only goes against public opinion but also violates the law. (Resolution: Submit petitions to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Interior, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Department of Finance, requesting that the Yangzhong County Government be instructed to seek truth from facts, reduce taxes based on actual circumstances, and alleviate the people's plight.) (2) Since taking office, Yangzhong County Magistrate Hong Kangxie has visited widely, diligently sought public opinion, worked hard to govern, and respected public opinion, making him a rare and virtuous official in the present day. (Resolution: The association should contribute its opinions as much as possible to promote benefits, eliminate abuses, and benefit the local community.) (3) Regarding the request to reduce land tax surcharges, in addition to submitting petitions to the government, departments, and provinces, it was resolved to send a letter to County Magistrate Hong, clarifying the long-standing abuses, eliminating corruption, and reducing the various land tax surcharges based on the local economic capacity and actual needs, in order to alleviate the people's plight. (4) In last year's land tax tragedy, dozens of innocent people were implicated, and 23 people are still detained in the Zhenjiang District Court. They are truly innocent victims, and their situation is pitiful. This matter is related to the request to reduce land tax surcharges, and the association should uphold justice. (Resolution: Send a letter to the Zhenjiang District Court, urging them to show compassion for the innocent and release them quickly.) (5) The secretariat will draft and issue the letters and telegrams immediately. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Letters</p>
<p>To the Editor, Upon investigation, the news article in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 2nd of this month regarding the fire at our company's warehouse contains many inaccuracies. (1) All of our company's ships have never been attacked by pirates. (2) Although our company's business in recent years has not been very good, we have not suffered losses every year. (3) Our manager, Yang Guanbei, has not been detained by the Public Security Bureau for questioning. The above points are all inconsistent with the facts and have a significant impact on our company's reputation and credit. We are sending this special letter to request correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Dada Shipping Co., Ltd. July 2nd.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I am writing to you about the work slowdown at the Texaco Oil Depot in Pudong. According to the volunteer police chief Wang Xiufeng, who is stationed at the depot, the worker Yao Longlong, who works in the tin room, reported to the station on the evening of the 28th of this month that he went to work in the factory at 7:00 AM on the 28th of this month. Because the Englishman Samson, who manages the solder, was late in arriving at the factory, Yao was afraid of delaying work, so he took other solder for use. When Samson arrived at the factory and found out, he blamed Yao and reported to the factory owner to suspend Yao from work for two weeks. After work at noon, more than 30 workers in the listening room, including Yao Longlong, were working slowly, but after mediation, the workers could return to work in the factory before the 2nd of next month. However, the news of a strike by all the workers at the Texaco Oil Depot in Pudong was published in your newspaper on the 29th, which is inevitably untrue, and our office has sent a number of volunteer police chiefs stationed at the depot, who are responsible for maintaining order, which is extremely important. Therefore, we are writing to you to publish this letter in the "Letters" column to avoid misunderstanding. Sincerely, Zhan Chun, Director of the Fourth Station of the Third District of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, June 30th.</p>

<p>League Against Writing in Literary Chinese</p>
<p>In today's revival of the debate between literary Chinese and vernacular Chinese, it is naturally very gratifying to receive a declaration from five warriors against literary Chinese, vowing not to use it. These five warriors are apprentices and shop assistants from a large store in Xiamen. They have not received formal education, and used to enjoy writing a few phrases in "zhi hu zhe ye" (classical Chinese particles). Now, from real life, they have accepted vernacular Chinese and abandoned literary Chinese, which is their progress. To implement their idea, the five agreed not to use literary Chinese in their letters from now on, and all daily written communication would be changed to vernacular Chinese. At first, the old shop was very disapproving. Later, an advertisement rewritten in vernacular Chinese proved to be very effective, leaving the old man speechless. Therefore, their actions aroused the interest of other people in the shop, and people who were hesitant were looking at them with surprised eyes, and vernacular Chinese books and newspapers gradually circulated in this conservative shop.</p>
<p>There are several things to note here. First, most of the people who opposed literary Chinese in the past were a few intellectuals. People in shops have always been conservative. Now that these heroes have emerged from shops, it can be seen that the power of vernacular Chinese has expanded, which is a good sign that the conservative camp is collapsing. Second, although those who advocated vernacular Chinese in the past opposed literary Chinese in principle, they still often used a few phrases in literary Chinese in their daily lives, just for fun. Their original intention was not to support literary Chinese, but objectively they unconsciously added to the prestige of literary Chinese. We have also received a letter from an apprentice who said, "I don't want to study classical Chinese anymore, but I often encounter 'classical Chinese phrases' in vernacular Chinese, so I feel that I have to study a few classical Chinese articles at the same time." This is the best example. Unintentional inclusion of some "literary Chinese" in vernacular Chinese may still cause people to study classical Chinese. As for the gentlemen who advocate vernacular Chinese writing long articles in literary Chinese, it will naturally influence others even more. This time, these five friends mutually agreed that everyone should not use literary Chinese in their writing, which is indeed an action worthy of attention. Third, the fact that these five friends can have a common action in a conservative shop is the greatest condition for their victory. They proved the application of vernacular Chinese can be higher than that of literary Chinese in practical use, giving the conservatives a huge blow in that advertisement, which is indeed the most effective tactic. Originally, opposition to literary Chinese is not an empty opposition, but a concrete proof with facts. Fourth, they are not dyed by the environment, not discouraged, and can practice what they preach, which is indeed the spirit of warriors. This is also worth mentioning.</p>
<p>In short, we introduce this news to "Reading News" for the following reasons. According to them, they have been greatly influenced by our "Reading Q&amp;A", and they are now friends of the Guidance Department. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce their reading life to everyone, this is one. Second, we very much hope that those who support vernacular Chinese can continue to agree "not to use literary Chinese" and form a "League Against Writing in Literary Chinese" which is a very meaningful work; especially in today's rampant resurgence of literary Chinese. Third, we hope that such progressive phenomena can occur in various conservative groups across the country, and that there will be people who work for the most economical tool for ideological communication.</p>
<p>Now someone has proposed Mass Language (大衆語). Completely abandoning literary Chinese and not mixing literary Chinese idioms in vernacular Chinese is undoubtedly a step forward towards Mass Language.</p>
<p>News of the Week</p>
<p>1. Enthusiastic Purchase of Reader Communication Stationery: Within a week, 41 readers from the local area came to the library to purchase 50 books. 13 readers from other places purchased 20 books. We hope that all readers will quickly switch to using the new stationery so that this department can organize, collect, and compile statistics as soon as possible. Each book has 100 pages and costs only two cents.</p>
<p>2. Summer Guidance: Many readers have asked us to introduce some summer reading materials that are widely available for general readers to spend the summer. We plan to publish ten literary books and ten social science books for everyone to refer to in the next issue of this publication. But in this week, we also solicit readers to tell us what they are preparing to read in the summer. For our reference.</p>
<p>3. Summer Service: Four student readers of this department are preparing to go home to run literacy schools during the summer vacation, and three (one of whom is a woman) are preparing to participate in a certain drama troupe to do drama education activities during the summer vacation.

<p>Free Discussion on the Construction of Popular Language Literature - Wang Renshu</p>
<p>I believe that under the name of this popular language literature, the first thing to be decided is the attribute of the term "popular." Because the term "popular" is inherently vague and lacks a definite attribute. Before feudal emperors, the people who shouted "Long live!" could certainly be called the popular; in the revolutionary arena, those who shouted "Down with!" and "Support!" could also be called the popular. Now that we want to build popular language literature, if it is not merely limited to the realm of language, as Mr. Hu Shih has said, it should also include popular consciousness. Then, which kind of popular will we take as the foundation? The distance between backward popular consciousness and advanced popular consciousness is almost a century. From hoping for the appearance of a true Son of Heaven to discovering oneself, the popular who want to shoulder the historical mission themselves, coincidentally appear in contrast in the current stage of China. At this time, the so-called construction of popular language literature has to face a great difficulty and contradiction.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must mention why some people are now advocating popular language literature, and what the role of advocating this popular language literature is. This can probably be explained as follows. The opportunity to promote popular language was stimulated by the revival movement of classical Chinese, as a movement against the revival of classical Chinese, and at the same time, to make the vernacular movement penetrate deeper into the popular. So, from the latter meaning, it is also the Aufhebung (sublation) of the vernacular. (In this newspaper's reading and Q&amp;A column, this meaning is also called "anti-vernacular." In fact, the "anti" in "anti-vernacular" and the "anti" in "anti-classical Chinese" have different meanings. Anti-classical Chinese is from its opposite form, while anti-vernacular is a kind of self-sublation and adjustment. This point should be distinguished). And the reason why the vernacular is to be sublated is to penetrate into the popular and approach the popular. This foundation is being built on the fact that many of the popular are still hoping for a true Son of Heaven, still cannot see their historical mission, and must be educated. In this educational sense, popular language literature unites the conflict between the backward popular and the advanced popular consciousness (that is, the contradiction between the backward popular consciousness and the progress of history) mentioned in the previous item. That is, the builders of popular language literature take the producing popular as their target, take the advanced popular consciousness as the content of their works, and engage in creation using the language actively used by the popular.</p>
<p>However, under this premise, another contradiction immediately arises. That is, when the "special group" who are not themselves the popular - such as the writers who are now proposing popular language literature - shoulder the task of constructing popular language literature at this stage, how can they make the language popular? In other words, these "special groups" are mostly determined by their own class and are more likely to use the May Fourth style (or comprador style) of vernacular. It is impossible for them to create popular language further. Even if they reluctantly try to put on a show and force the language to become popular, the result will be that they will absorb as much as possible those floating, easily accepted slang words of the non-producing popular. This phenomenon has been significantly manifested in the more advanced works in China at this stage. I remember that the Literary Monthly once published a poem scolding the Reading Magazine faction, and Mr. Lu Xun criticized it. And the real reason for the production of this poem lies in this point.</p>
<p>When the problem is developed to this point, it is felt that the construction of popular language literature fundamentally has a contradiction, and it seems impossible. But this is not the case. There are ways to resolve this contradiction. That is the question of the writer's practice. It is the old slogan "Go to the people." It is the question of participating in the producing popular and living together with them. Only in practice can the vocabulary of the popular be increased in the works; only in practice can the support of the popular for feudal remnants be weakened. Being able to increase the vocabulary of the popular in the works means that the works have established a relationship with the popular and fulfilled the task of education; at the same time, being able to weaken the feudal remnants in the popular, then through the works, it is easy to arouse the popular to carry out anti-feudal and anti-imperialist movements, and open up another arena. (Anti-imperialism should be linked with anti-feudalism. Because at the present stage, the feudal forces in China are actually fostered by imperialism to facilitate its own aggression.) At that time, not only will the classical Chinese revival movement lose its basis, but also the comprador-style vernacular will naturally be eliminated. However, when popular language literature develops to that time, it must Aufheben (sublate) itself again. What kind of literature should the newly emerged one be?</p>
<p>Of course, this process is not as mechanical and simple as described above. The construction of popular language literature must have other driving forces, that is, the main driving force in social change. That cannot be described in detail in this short article, so it will stop here.</p>
<p>My conclusion is this: In the process of constructing popular language literature, the conflict between backward popular consciousness and the progress of history can be unified by giving it the meaning of education. And the contradiction between the language that the writers of non-popular origin at the current stage are inherently good at using and the popular language can be unified by practice. And practice can unify the contradictions in all problems.</p>
<h3 id="e69">On Heavenly Principles Not Reversing - Ling Mo <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>It is not necessarily that only eight-legged essays contain clichés like "Heaven and earth are the universe," but all classical Chinese articles rely on empty words and clichés to maintain the scene. If one originally thought that an article was just a framework, then it could be allowed to fill the empty space, but unfortunately, some people use a cliché and think they have grasped the truth.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, someone criticized the absurdity of "Things must rot first, and then insects are born," but those who write in classical Chinese would never change their belief to insects are born and then things rot. Now, "Heavenly principles circulate, and when things reach their extreme, they reverse" has become a weapon again, but this cliché is not much more understandable than things rot and then insects are born.</p>
<p>To the old gentlemen, I advise them to best abide by the teachings of the sages, recognize that "Heavenly principles are distant" and there is no need to talk too much about them, otherwise at least they must know that today's heaven is no longer as mysterious as before.</p>
<p>We can no longer believe that there is something ruling the heaven. If the so-called heavenly principles are deduced from the "naturalness" of celestial motion, then even if we do not talk about the fact that this naturalness may not have any connection with human affairs, this naturalness is not a good analogy for "circulation and repetition."</p>
<p>Fortunately, time has not been misunderstood. No one thinks that tomorrow morning is a repetition of today morning. Then how can the sun rising in the east tomorrow morning be said to be a repetition of the sun rising in the east today morning?</p>
<p>Even if time is forgotten, the sun every day does not rise in the same point in the east. Thus every day is not a "circulation and repetition." To put it a little longer, after a tropical year, the sun can rise in the east at the same point on the same day as a year ago, but at this time the sun's position on the celestial sphere has regressed by fifty seconds. The Earth may be willing to run consistently on its orbit forever, but the sun itself must also move, so it can never circulate and repeat.</p>
<p>Do we hope that the sun also has an orbit, and that after hundreds of millions of years, it will one day return to its original position? Indeed, there may be such an orbit, but by the time the sun circulates and repeats on the orbit, those other stars, those that move slower than it, those that move faster than it, those that come towards it, those that go away from it, will have already changed their positions, and will no longer be the original environment.</p>
<p>Moreover, when talking about hundreds of millions of years, we again encounter time, which never "circulates and repeats," acting up. In the long term of hundreds of millions of years, the sun may have gradually become old, or even be approaching the brink of extinction. In addition, the sun is not very peaceful on its journey. It has to pass through space full of gravel, and it has to break into the territory of other star countries. Maybe it suddenly encounters an accident and dies prematurely. It may also be subjected to external forces and go off track.</p>
<p>Our world, the Earth, is not a very large thing, but it is enough for people to travel a lifetime and still not finish traveling it, so humans can already not fly in a circle like flies and return to the same place. The reason why there are still many humans in the world who fly in a circle and return to the same place is only because humans are closer to flies. As for the greatness of the universe (heaven), even if a solar system is compared to it, it is still much greater than comparing a person to the Earth. The sun and its family have many places to go in the universe, and there is no need to mess around in a small range.</p>
<p>In fact, anything that is in motion is constantly changing and can never return to its original state. This is the simplest and most easily understood "naturalness." Why do people ignore it when they really talk about nature (heaven)? Honestly, they did not really think about the connection between heavenly principles and naturalness, but after writing the topic of naturalness, they unconsciously thought of the cliché of "when things reach their extreme, they reverse." Not only did they not consider that heavenly principles do not reverse, but they even forgot the heavenly principle of "no extremes" that has been recognized since ancient times.</p>
<p>The education of Chinese astronomy has never been developed, perhaps to make good use of the empty term "heavenly principles" to confuse people.</p>

<p>It was a drunkenly beautiful early summer afternoon. White clouds and dark clouds were running side by side in the sky, and the sunlight flickered in and out. A gentle breeze brought a faint fragrance.</p>
<p>I, WK, and M were together, all three of us were elementary school teachers full of the air of poor scholars.</p>
<p>"Going to Zhabei?" I suggested after we attended a meeting that we had to attend in our official capacity.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go to mourn Shanggong Elementary School!" M replied to me very emotionally, because all three of us had taught at Shanggong.</p>
<p>"The ruins of Shanggong probably can't be found!"</p>
<p>At this time, we had already stepped onto Baoshan Road after the war. Both sides were full of broken walls and ruins. Some of the damaged buildings had been completely demolished, and it was almost impossible to tell what they were originally. As for those buildings that had not been demolished, they were also trembling in the air, with one or two blades of grass bursting out of the cracks in the walls.</p>
<p>The ruins of the Commercial Press and the Oriental Library gradually unfolded before our eyes. The steel-concrete outline still stood alone in the green mounds, but its entire body had been splattered with countless gun holes, and several walls had already revealed gaps, and some of the steel bars could no longer be hidden.</p>
<p>The three of us walked to the entrance of the Commercial Press General Factory, and saw a sign on the gate that said "No Visitors Allowed," the handwriting was already a bit blurred.</p>
<p>"It will never allow visitors!" Mr. K said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Where is Shanggong Elementary School?" Mr. M almost couldn't find that Shanggong Elementary School where he had taught for four years and had doted on a girl.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's a little past here!" I discovered that the fence built next to the wall of the Commercial Press was the entrance to Baoxing West Lane where Shanggong Elementary School was located.</p>
<p>"No! No! You have to walk past it," Mr. K put on the airs of an old hand who had taught here for eight years.</p>
<p>We advanced along the side of a small ditch. The bases of the demolished houses greeted our footsteps high and low. The ruins of the Commercial Press and the Oriental Library grinned at us like skeletons. The dark clouds in the sky also defeated the white clouds, blocking the fierce sunlight from us.</p>
<p>"Where are the ruins of Shanggong Elementary School?" I was getting a little impatient with the search.</p>
<p>"Completely demolished!" Mr. K replied to me like he was teaching a child.</p>
<p>In front of us, there was a shallow, flat lawn, on which sat three or five children, talking and laughing. Around them were piles of rubble and blades of grass a foot long.</p>
<p>"This lawn is probably the lawn in the Yangzhen Kindergarten from before," Mr. W announced his conclusion after careful observation.</p>
<p>"This is where the gate of Shanggong Elementary School was! Look, aren't the doorposts still standing upright?" Mr. K shouted.</p>
<p>"This is the old site of the fish pond, now it's been filled in!"..."</p>
<p>"This is..."</p>
<p>After a fierce debate, we finally calmed down. A bitter smile floated on everyone's face. When the planes of Japanese imperialism were bombing Zhabei, Mr. K and I were hiding in the countryside to avoid the disaster, and Mr. K was also listening to the sound of artillery every day in his hometown, a small island at the mouth of the Yangtze River. Although we had all mingled here for many years, we didn't see the final tragic scene of the destruction of Shanggong Elementary School!</p>
<p>"Let me take some souvenirs back!"</p>
<p>Mr. M searched for a long time in the rubble, but never found anything.</p>
<p>"It's time to go back, don't delay any longer, you can't find anything anyway!" Mr. K was eager to meet a friend.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Yokohama Bridge, we jumped on a streetcar on Route 1. The carriage was crowded with foreign girls, and the fair breasts and pink arms exposed outside the sleeves of their shirts gave us a great temptation. The car drove past station after station, and skyscrapers stood tall on both sides of the road. The flags of "Summer Sale" fluttered in the wind, and the radio kept singing... We were thus dragged into another world by the ruthless streetcar.</p>

<p>#### On the dock</p>
<p>Hong Kong is a place I have visited before. After staying for only one night and one morning, I took the opportunity to take a ship via Shantou to Shanghai.</p>
<p>On the dock, I ran into a small ship decorated with lanterns and colored hangings. Under the four large characters of "Inviting Ghosts by Land and Sea," there were several monks or nuns (we had no way to check whether they were male or female, so here we have to stand both male and female.) muttering. Later, with a whoosh, the wheels rolled; presumably the ethereal ghosts had already been invited to follow the ship!</p>
<p>Where are these ghosts being taken to? I thought.</p>
<p>Suppose the city is a slaughterhouse and a cemetery, a frenzied gathering and a lewd dance, tall buildings and basements, rubber and brain oil, cars and rickshaws, gentlemen and beggars, the complexity of the tracks and the boiling of profit-seeking... Ghosts, if you know after death, do you feel disgusted, so are you being transported to the quiet countryside?</p>
<p>Oh! City! Even ghosts cannot live in peace?</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking this, my friend said "Goodbye". So, I got into a small boat and immediately left the dock and ran towards the big ship. Naturally, it would only take a moment for the small boat to kiss the dock again, and when will I set foot on this place again!</p>
<p>City! I am far away from you! But I am a living person, and now I am throwing myself into the city again!</p>

<p>The day the train arrived in Kowloon, there were our heroic compatriots waiting at the station to do inspection work. Needless to say, those who were dressed nicely could pass through the checkpoint casually. If you were not dressed nicely and were carrying a leather suitcase in your hand, then naturally you would not be missed and would be very qualified to be inspected. As for me, I was carrying a not-so-small leather suitcase in my hand because it was hot and I was not wearing it, so I obviously couldn't escape.</p>

<p>Commercial News - Financial - The Dreary Financial Business</p>
<p>In recent days, the banking sector has been in a state of closure, and news from all sides has been extremely quiet. The market situation has also been greatly affected by the customary holidays of all Chinese merchant banks, and the entire financial business has been a spoiler, as if there were no market. Looking back on the past year, there have been many events and the economy has been sluggish. The financial situation has declined accordingly, and it is especially deserted in this hot summer. Yesterday's overnight call loan rate was still five percent in the morning and afternoon. There was no market for clearing as usual. In terms of call loan transactions, over 3.8 million were transferred in the morning, over 100,000 in new transactions, over 30,000 in the afternoon, and over 20,000 in small general meetings. Money shops received over 33 million in silver dollars, over 400,000 in remittances from all routes, and money shops took over 300,000 in redemption of silver dollar mortgages. Banks did not receive any silver dollars. The price of Shanghai silver fluctuated by 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the price of Jiangnan small silver dollar suddenly fell by 10 yuan to 835 yuan, while in the afternoon, it still rose, returning to the original level of the previous afternoon, at 845 yuan. Although there was no rise or fall, the difference between the rise and fall in the middle reached as much as 10 yuan, with 2,000 exchanges in the morning and 3,000 in the afternoon. The early morning price of Guangdong small silver dollar was 732 yuan and 5 jiao, and the afternoon price was 730 yuan and 05 jiao. As a result, the difference between the two markets was 2 yuan. The early market trading volume was 90,000 jiao, and the afternoon trading volume was 10,000 jiao. Copper coins were 332,000, which was 500 less than the previous day. The transaction was 30,548 strings, with a total value of 9,400 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Yarn and Cotton - Increased Taxes Drive Prices Up <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was quite weak in the morning, and the decline in old cotton was even more intense. Powerful bull companies have completely let go, and the large amount of one bank has also been settled at market prices. As a result, the market situation is relaxed. However, in the afternoon, there were rumors in the business community that the national government would increase the tax on imported foreign cotton, and Japanese merchants had obtained definite news that the tax would be increased by 1.5 gold units per quintal. Therefore, the market suddenly turned upward.</p>
<p>#### Han Standard Initially Fell and Then Rose</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton futures market, although U.S. cotton rose, many bulls came out in the market, so the decline in old cotton became even more intense. However, the news that new cotton would increase due to drought and increased import taxes was still uncertain, and the situation was slightly higher. As a result, old cotton fell by 3.4 jiao and new cotton fell by 0.05 yuan. The market was still weak at the opening in the afternoon. By the third session, the market atmosphere suddenly tightened, and buying increased suddenly. It was heard that Japanese merchants had obtained news that the increase in taxes on imported foreign cotton had been announced, with a tax of 1.5 gold units per quintal. As a result, the bulls were very active. Another saying was that the Japanese side bought 1,000 dan per session in the three closing sessions every month, so the prices of each month jumped up by 2.3.4 jiao. As a result, old cotton rose by 4.5 jiao to 7 jiao, and new cotton rose by 0.3 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 116,100 dan. It was found that 1,200 dan were sold by Yuan Yi, 1,200 dan by Tongxing, 3,500 dan by Yuanda, 4,200 dan by Tongji, 3,100 dan by Suifeng, 1,400 dan by Changji, 2,400 dan by Renfeng, 5,100 dan by Changfeng, 3,200 dan by Yichang, 1,300 dan by Xincheng, 1,300 dan by Ruiyuan, and 1,400 dan by Yifeng. 10,500 dan were bought by Changfeng, 8,100 dan by Changhe, 7,100 dan by Huikang, 4,200 dan by Dachang, 1,800 dan by Gengfeng, and 1,500 dan by Changji. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e75">Spot Cotton Sales Stalled <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The sales of spot cotton were quite clear. Each factory indicated that there was no buying appetite, as there were more shutdowns and reduced work, and the demand was reduced. The source was only 300 bales of Tonghua cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Yarn Market Remained Weak <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and recovered in the afternoon, but the sales of spot yarn became more depressed. The buying appetite of each group was quite sluggish, which weakened people's hearts. However, the market was still weak at the opening in the afternoon. Later, due to the increased tax on imported foreign cotton, the cotton market trended upward, and the yarn market was stimulated to rise. The recent decline in yarn was slightly severe.</p>
<p>#### Yarn Futures</p>
<p>At the opening of the yarn futures market, although U.S. cotton rose, according to newspaper reports, the national government reduced the tax on cotton imports by 5 percent. As a result, there was a lack of buyers in the market, and the near-month fell by 1.8 yuan, and the consecutive month fell by 7.89 jiao. The market was still weak after two or three sessions of daily shooting. As a result, each month fell by 1.1.2.3. jiao, and the consecutive fell by 6.7 jiao. The market atmosphere was still weak at the opening in the afternoon. It was heard that the sales of spot yarn were not smooth. By the third closing session, the cotton market rose due to increased taxes, and the yarn market rose. As a result, each month rose by 3.5.6 jiao in the afternoon, and the near month rose by 1.2 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 29,900 bales. It was found that 800 bales were sold by Da Ji, 700 bales by Jifeng, 950 bales by Dafeng, 800 bales by Shenji, 950 bales by Yichang, 800 bales by Dachang, 500 bales by Junchang, 550 bales by Renfeng, and 500 bales by Tongji. 2,000 bales were bought by Xincheng, 700 bales by Dafel, 1,800 bales by Changfeng, 500 bales by Changyu, 850 bales by Shenji, 1,000 bales by Gengfeng, and 800 bales by Huikang.

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially quiet and firm due to the lack of sellers due to bad weather. Later, the market turned back due to the settlement of some bulls. As a result, spot prices rose by 10 points, and futures prices rose by 7 to 9 points. British cotton futures fell by 2 points. Indian cotton was weak due to the settlement of bulls and the selling of European exporters. As a result, Pingar fell by 2 rupees, and Aumra and Bailuoxi remained unchanged.

<p>In the futures market last week, transporters mostly sold old cotton for July and August and bought new cotton for April and May next year, while other foreign accounts did the opposite. In the spot market, the quantity transported to the mainland and Lancashire was reduced compared to the beginning of the year, and there were few inquiries from the Far East. However, according to observers, Japan is currently purchasing U.S. cotton futures. If U.S. cotton rises, it will definitely enter the Indian market, and the difference between the U.S. and Indian markets will be wider soon. The statistics for the last week are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Bank reported that yesterday's (30th) stock market trading was the quietest in ten years. The Nash Automobile Company reissued dividends, so people's hearts were still good, but the market was sluggish and almost stagnant. The steel workload in the Youngstown area next week is expected to be only 20 percent, which is the lowest record in the area, but steel stock prices were quite flat. The situation in the small exchange and the bond market was also sluggish, with almost no gains or losses. U.S. government bonds were firm, with 190,000 shares traded in half a day. Also, according to a report from this bank's New York agent, the stock market situation was extremely sluggish, and price increases and decreases were meaningless. The wheat market was flat, and it failed to rally due to continuous arbitrage. Wheat harvesting work has reached its peak. In terms of the situation, it is appropriate to buy at lows. The weather is normal temperature, with rain in several places. The price of (corn) should rise, and the acreage will benefit bulls. (Cotton) rose due to the continued drought in Texas. The south sold off at high prices, making it difficult to rise. The industry's buying appetite is still good. Also, according to a special telegram from New York Standard Statistical Company, although the market has been extremely sluggish recently and speculation has been extremely cold, the future of securities is definitely optimistic. This company's investment strategy has not changed, that is, it is appropriate to balance securities with profits and those with opportunities. Purchases should be concentrated on auto parts, chemical materials belonging to construction, agricultural and industrial machinery, office equipment, kerosene, railroad department stores, railroad materials, and good stocks of sugar factories. Due to the abundance of bank idle funds and the lack of lending channels, this situation is bound to help the market trend higher. From a long-term speculative standpoint, American Foundry ordinary shares and Pu Er B shares are quite suitable for purchase. Due to recent bad weather, the cotton production rate will be lower than usual, so cotton can be purchased. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month initially set a continued plunge. The quoted price of foreign wheat has fallen by 3.4 jiao to 6.7 jiao in the past two days. In addition, although this port is still arid and rainless, all the inland townships have received sweet rain, and the north road is particularly sufficient. Therefore, the human heart has disintegrated. That is, silver dollar speculators have profited from high prices, and manufacturers' chips have also been thrown out while prices are high. Therefore, those who see the opportunity, once they sell, the market will see a wild drop. Since mid-May, there has been frequent high rises. Although there is no reason for the rise, the annual wheat harvest is very abundant, and the actual sales on the north road have not expanded with the environment. Therefore, the appearance is solid but the inside is empty, and most of it is caused by speculators. The drop in the morning is a counter-evidence of the unrealistic rise. Until the opening in the afternoon, the trend has entered a spin. This month is slightly better, and the August, September, and October months have fallen again. After that, the situation is settled. The trading volume of each session is not as smooth as in the morning, only 400,000 to 500,000 bales. The situation will be eased if this port also gets sweet rain. As a result, this month fell sharply by 4.25%, August and September fell by 6.25%, October fell by 6.5%, November fell by 4.75%, and December initially opened at 2.355 yuan, and the closing price also fell by 2%.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, each month's market saw a consistent plunge. The quoted price of foreign wheat has fallen by about 3.4 jiao to 6.7 jiao in the past two days. In addition, each place in Jiangnan has received sweet rain, and the quoted prices in wheat-producing areas have all fallen. If the manufacturer in Wuxi closes down due to poor flour sales. Therefore, after the opening price, the human heart saw a big emptiness, and the bulls returned one after another. The owners of the company that have spot goods in this city and other cities are also continuing to sell. Therefore, the decline in the near and far periods has been greatly increased, and the smoothness of the transaction is rarely seen. The flour market also loosened wildly until the opening in the afternoon, the human heart became empty, and the near and far periods fell by another 2.3%. According to this situation, I am afraid that there will be a big change in the future when the real goods are accumulated. As a result, this month fell by a huge 1.1 jiao, August fell by 0.7 jiao, September fell by 0.9 jiao, October fell by 0.8 jiao, and November fell by 0.7 jiao. The standard for the current wheat market has also fallen sharply due to the decline in prices in the producing areas. The opening prices of each stall are 3 yuan for Bengbu Mingguang Yaowan Xinyang wheat, 3 yuan and 02 cents for South Suzhou wheat, 2.9 jiao for Daqiao wheat, 2.83 yuan for Wuhu wheat, 2.75 cents for second-grade, 2.85 yuan for Jiang Xinzhou wheat, 2.83 cents for second-grade, 3.05 yuan for Shandong wheat, and 2.78 yuan for Nanjing wheat, 2.75 cents for the other. From Fuxin to 20,000 packages, Fufeng to 10,000 packages, Huafeng to 1,000 packages, and Xinda to 2,000 packages.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai)</p>
<p>There are more than 30 sources from each group, about 4600 to 4700 shis of goods. On the sales side, this street still sees movement, and the stomach of the customer group is still slack. The market is stable due to the drought. The price of japonica rice such as Changbang Su Tong and South Port still shows a rise of several cents. Although only 300 bags of late rice Beiyang gangs such as Qingjiao Song Si Xi Lian have gone, the other stomachs are quite healthy, and there are 500 bags of boxed children on the shelf. The market is also good for 2.3 points. There are not many Duyang sharp arrivals, and sales are also sluggish. The market has neither glory nor shame, and the market of Yin Bian Yuan (another type of rice) is similar in supply and demand.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai)</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were about 20 sources for each route in Hexia. Each cargo in the market went to the stomach. The price of white japonica was tight in the morning market, and the price was shouted tightly. The zero sales in the afternoon market were extremely deserted, and the market turned to be fixed. There was little arrival and sales of white yuan, and the market was tired. Early thin rice, the market was normal, and the price was tight. The trading volume of Yang Du and customer sharp were very few, and the price trend was fixed.</p>

<p>Although Hexia rice rose yesterday, the market trend of ocean customer indica was different from that of Hexia rice due to sufficient inventory and arrivals. The inventory of middle and second grades was particularly high, and the market price saw a small number of returns. There were more than 100,000 packages of small twisted rice in inventory. The customer group was watching, and only the local street was active. The market was even more difficult to develop.

<p>Compared with the situation last week, the soybean market yesterday changed slightly.

The market continued to build for 2.3 points yesterday, but hoping that the factory stomach will continue, the human heart may be firm and stable. The total market counted the number of carriages of various soybeans at 133. In addition to the 6 carriages that the factory went to, the rest were sold by the local street and export groups.</p>
<p>Since the hot weather, the way to go for soybeans has been slightly active, and the market price has been built. But there are no large-scale sales, and there is little development in the market price. It is also difficult to sell high-quality goods at good prices. Yesterday, the opening price of Tianjin was 4 yuan, Mingguang was 2.77 yuan, Bengbu was 2.57 yuan and 2.2 jiao.</p>
