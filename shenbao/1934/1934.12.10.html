<h3>慶祝勦匪勝利之意義蔣中正</h3>
<p>勦匪勝利實爲我全國民衆一致之心理</p>
<p>與後方同志共同努力所得之效果</p>
<p>旬日來各地同胞以贛省勦匪完成。積年匪巢。根本摧毁。閩贛陷匪區域。次第收復。數載期望。逹於一旦。紛紛舉行慶祝勦匪勝利大會。並對勦匪將士。予以熱烈之慰勞。本日首都及上海各地。並皆舉行盛大之集會。慰勉之電。絡繹而至。中正對此。彌增惶愧。由勦匪將士言。赤匪禍國殘民。薄海同憤。久稽殱僇。以迄於今。方自疚職責之未盡。何敢承獎勉之交加。由國家觀點言。爲民除暴。執行天罰。對於剷除匪類。實無勝利之可言。且師行所至。勞及民衆。傷亡殘廢。瘡痍滿目。抑亦何忍言勝利。痛定思痛。但有悲感而已。如必謂勦匪勝利。毋寗謂爲民衆勝利。故今日之慶祝。實慶祝我全體國民本身之勝利。望我民衆。共同一致。再接再厲。澈始澈終。消弭过氛。以不負今日慶祝之盛典也。中正嘗言勦匪須七分政治之力量。而軍事僅居其三分。今日勦匪之獲有成效。在黨國固不忍湮没前方將士死傷犧牲之忠烈。實尤賴於後方同志任勞任怨。不辭艱鉅。鞏固政治。維持秩序。策畫財政。籌濟軍實之毅力與苦心。用能使前方將士。械彈無缺。餉糈不匱。絶後顧之憂。勵前進之勇。總言之。實前後方共同努力之結果。而後方同志同胞。在政治社會各方面。扶持鼓勵之效力爲尤多。中正對於後方在政治財政治安交通輿論各方面負責諸同志。敢代表前方將士。敬致誠摯之感謝。而尤確認爲此次勦匪克以收效。其最大力量。厥爲全國民衆痛恨赤匪。誓不兩立之一致無二的心理。此種一致的心理之發揮。不僅使前方奮鬥之將士。得到無限之鼓勵與安慰。亦使陷入歧途者。有自㧞來歸之决心。人心向背之機。實足以證明共產匪徒虛僞殘酷之行動。斷不能存在於世界。尤爲我中國民衆所不容也。由此次剿匪之經騐。可知民衆一致的心理。其力量之偉大。實無與比倫。此種無形的力量。實超越於任何有形的力量。而足以勝過任何之困難。苟以過去對於剿共之一致的心理。用之於救國。敢信任何危急之國家。無不可由我民衆一致之心理爲之挽救。而所以表示舉國一致的心理者。卽在擁護政府對內對外之政策。確信政府所施之政策。必能收穫最後之效果。中正願吾同胞一爲深思。在剿匪進行中。若非全國國民視剿匪成敗爲切身之利害。對剿匪軍事有一致之信任與期待。予以種種精神與物質之鼓勵。則此一民族巨患。亦何能在此千艱萬苦中予以弭除。前例昭昭。國難未已。切願吾同胞珍視此一寶貴之敎訓。卽以一致勦匪之心理。用之於一致救國。則勦匪犧牲之將士。咸能瞑目於地下。以視寵榮褒卹嘉惠尤爲宏多。至於贛省殘匪。雖尙有漏網西竄之徒衆。然吾人深信贛南積年盤踞根深蒂固之匪巢。旣經剗平。其殘餘流竄之匪。狼豕奔突。已失憑藉。惶駭散亂。勢弱力分。此後澈底消滅。必不如進勦其老巢時爲力之難。流匪目的。在於川黔。川黔兩省。土地之廣。物產之豐。雖有過於贛南。然川黔民衆。賦性之剛勁。自衛力量之强厚。以及補恨赤匪之深切。决不如贛南民衆之易受脅迫與誘惑。匪衆西竄。在川黔决無立足之地。觀於歷代著匪巨寇。無不以入川黔之日。兆其末路而歸於崩亡。吾人可信今後進勦。必易於爲力。武裝同志。必本其最大之决心。盡其最後之努力。除此民族巨患。以慰全國父老與同胞之期望。更願全國一致精誠不懈。併力剗除此復興之障碍。而爲國家立一更新之基礎也。</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫仇視匈牙利中歐局勢更緊張</h3>
<p>匈僑三千人被逐回國</p>
<p>塞人屢次侵襲匈國境</p>
<p>法意左右袒英主愼重</p>
<p>（倫敦）南斯拉夫當局讐對匈僑之運動、現無寬弛之象、以故中歐局勢較前更見緊張、昨夜復有匈人若干、由南國返匈、南國匈僑被逐回國者、迄今已逹三千人、若輩老少旣抵邊界四格特站、卽跪於怱遽收拾之囊槖側、祈禱上帝護佑、安抵生命不再受危之地、</p>
<p>最近一批難民抵後、匈牙利大學生曾集衆示威、反對南斯拉夫、匈當局亟調警察大隊防範續起事端、</p>
<p>邊界聞已發生侵襲數次、最近一次爲武裝塞維亞人一隊、深入匈境三百碼、惟匈政府迄今尙鎭靜自處、並注重救濟難民、顯願使公憤漸平、</p>
<p>昨日南國京城之趨響、已减小兩國間突衝之嚴重性、尙當局表示驅逐匈僑之程序、擬仍進行、但將取較和緩之政策、聞匈國陸軍當局决議如南軍施政、則寗願放棄四格特鎭、因該地幾無險可守也、昨夜匈京當局否認已派援軍至邊界之說、</p>
<p>昨日日內瓦國聯行政院復開會討論南斯拉夫爲馬賽血案申責匈牙利之備忘錄、各代表尤其爲英國掌璽大臣艾登、曾竭力不涉及政治、而純就法律點加以討論、此種努力、顯未獲有效果、因法外長賴伐爾以動聽之言論宣布法國贊助南國對馬賽血案所舉之各節、而意代表阿洛錫則發言維護匈牙利、惟兩政治家均贊成向國聯行政院提議取國際行動以對付恐怖主義、賴伐爾宣布法國贊助南斯拉夫之言曰、「法國對此嚴重之事務立於南斯拉方面、若輩槍擊亞歷山大王、實圖摧殘和平也、實圖破壞亞歷山大王之工作也、此事端賴吾儕、卽國聯行政院、監視不得陷和平於危險中」云、英國之意見以爲全案乃屬司法性質、南國之備忘錄國聯應以法庭之地位考量之、俄代表李維諾夫亦發簡短之演說、詆責恐怖主義、英代表艾登力勸各代表將事實與意志政策分别而論、艾謂馬賽血案之責任、今尙難斷定、因所謂負責者、尙未經審訊也、目前討論、應於是行政院乃宣布延會至星期一日上午十時三十分、</p>
<p>匈國已以關於南王亞歷山大遇害案之備忘錄、送致國聯、否認匈政府或匈當道對於管束南國逋逃者殊乏熱心之說、並申辯匈當道曾以護照發給南國恐怖黨一節、繼謂凡違法越過邊界之人、均依各國所施戒防間諜條例解送民事與軍事當道審訊云、</p>
<p>駐日內瓦南國公使評論昨日國聯行政院之會議曰、「君等戴放大鏡以考慮决議案、冀覓求殺害吾國君主主謀者之罪戾、吾人其能望國人滿意乎」、其意蓋嫌國聯行政院對匈之態度過於和緩也、據現勢觀之、國聯行政院一方面將通過對馬賽血案表示譴責之决議案、一方面將締結國際公約、規定政治逋逃客之待遇、</p>
<p>巴黎各報評論昨日捷克外長皮尼士博士所發小恊約國準備以戰爭保衛其土地完整之宣言、亦以爲主張修正和約者之活動、已危及歐洲之和平、某報謂萬一戰事發生、則卽國聯亦不能保全和平、又有一報謂皮尼士博士之宣言、正當其時、足使主張修約者受一致命的打擊云、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務總理赫爾今日鄭重宣布、美國對南斯拉夫與匈牙利之爭執决取旁觀態度、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>各國代表演說</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院、於本日午後三時、繼續開會、討論南斯拉夫所申請之馬賽暗殺案政治責任問題、法·意·俄·英·西班牙代表、均發表重要之演說、行政院繼乃延會至下星期一日、繼續討論、茲摘述各大國代表演說如下、</p>
<p>法國外長賴伐爾代表法國政府發言、略謂馬賽血案中、法國與南斯拉夫、實共患難、法國外長、與南王、同時慘遭狙擊、亞歷山大一世、爲南斯拉夫統一之首創者、暴徒欲得而甘心、其用意實在破壞和平、今南王雖逝、而其和平事業、則繼續存在、必須加以保護、最近討論薩爾問題時、行政院曾表示可使用物質力量、以使秩序、勿遭擾亂、今對於此案、國聯會所負責任、亦正相同、干犯法紀之行爲、不當用作政治之工具、故本人主張、行政院應有所行動、共同討論商定國際制裁之方法而後可云、</p>
<p>意大利代表阿樂西亞男爵、繼賴伐爾發表演說、首先頌揚南王亞歷山大與法外長巴爾都之功業、繼引意相墨索里尼之言、請意國參加日內瓦之辯論、悉本合作與和平之志願、當此千鈞一髮之際、國際聯合會、應担當疏解之任務、今　吾人之前、有人對一國家、加以十分嚴重之斥責、甚且傷害其民族榮譽、匈牙利駁斥此種伸訴、乃係出於公道、其請求行政院立卽處理本案、務使其眞相大明、實爲匈牙利應有之權利與義務、至於匈牙利代表哀卡爾脫所陳修改和約一節、其性質出於和平、與恐怖主義截然不同、行政院將此項宣言、予以備案、卽已足矣、意大利最初卽主張條約應適合時代之新需要、惟如此方爲保障和平之上策、然修改條約以求適合新需要、務必以合法方式爲之、法國外長主張以國際行動取締恐怖主義之問題、意大利亦將加以考慮云、</p>
<p>蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫阿樂亞西登壇演說謂對於本案事實、彼當保留意見、但彼以爲南斯拉夫與法國、實有向行政院伸訴請加判斷之權利、李維諾夫繼復伸述其對於恐怖主義之略史、並謂自大戰以後恐怖主義層見迭出、此種恐怖行動、多屬反動性質、且往往係在外國領土內之所準備、其中並有目的專在挑撥兩國間之衝突者、無論何國、均不應容許此種行動之存在、吾人則憎恨個人的恐怖主義、尤爲甚焉、至於馬賽血案、足以危害國際和平國聯會具有維持和平之責、應善爲處理、總之對於此種問題、顯有國際團結之必要也云云、</p>
<p>至是英國掌璽大臣艾登發言、首先追悼南斯拉夫之國喪、謂此類事實、今乃得在議壇上、從容鎭靜、加以討論、可謂不幸中之幸事、此案同謀犯、尙繫獄中、調查尙未完竣、故在目前發表意見、極爲困難、艾登繼就南斯拉夫所提出預防恐怖主義之主張、作普遍之陳述、謂英國人民對於政治犯應享之庇護權、極爲重視、然自由與放縱、二者不宜併爲一談、英國政府斷不容許在其國境內準備危害他國當局之强暴行動、目前所最要者、則當使空氣緩和、國際仇恨、不至繼長增高、並竭全力援助行政院、以限制問題之範圍、勿使擴大云、</p>
<p>於是波蘭代表亦起而致辭、謂波蘭介於匈牙利與南斯拉夫兩友邦之間、當保持不偏不倚之態度、如國聯會規定各國互助制度、以禁絶此類犯罪行爲、則波蘭亦準備予以合作云、</p>
<p>最後由西班牙代表瑪逹里伽演說、首先稱揚南斯拉夫·法國·與匈牙利之沉着態度、謂國聯會行政院之設、不僅爲主持公道、其尤要者、當在於行動、行政院今當保持鎭靜、靜待各方妥恊時期之到臨、此外並當採取各項補救方法、如取締軍火貿易等此外尙有他國代表演說、稱頌南王與法外長巴爾都、茲不備錄、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法外長謀妥恊</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院連日討論南斯拉夫與匈牙利關於馬賽暗殺事件之爭端、迄未有所决定、此一問題旣與歐洲安寗、息息相關、故法國外長賴伐爾將以全部時間、尋覓成立决議案之方式、此項决議案、旣須使南斯拉夫滿意、復不當拂其他各國之意志、且必使能獲得出席行政院各國之一致通過、連匈牙利亦在其內、賴伐爾業經與希臘代表會商、午後將再與意國代表阿樂亞西、英國代表艾登、或其他各國代表、舉行談話、此外賴伐爾並於今晨會見南斯拉夫外長葉夫的區、葉氏以南斯拉夫及其友邦讓步之最大限度、面告賴伐爾、查星期六日行政院之會議、造成一種局勢對於本問題之友誼解决、殊不順利、結果乃使日內瓦及小恊商與巴爾幹恊商各國京城有關係各方面、均大爲失望、不寗唯是、因程序問題使本問題之解决、益增糾紛、蓋按照國聯會盟約第十一條、本問題係適用和解程序、一切决議、必須一致通過、南斯拉夫及匈牙利兩當事國、與其他出席行政院之各國、有同等之表决權、因次欲成立决議案、益見其困難矣、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英意荷瑞派警維持薩爾治安</h3>
<p>國聯行政院决定</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院今日通過决議邀請英意荷蘭及瑞典共同遣派人員編成國際警隊以資明年一月中薩爾舉行投票自决時維持該區治安、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國際警察入薩爾維持治安問題、業於今日下午在國聯行政院會議席上提出討論、由阿樂西男爵發表所有願行加入國際警隊之各國及德國業已同意之報告且德政府已正式用書面答復三人委員會表示同意、故三人委員會請大會注意此點、而將各項必需手續完成之隨由捷克外長皮尼士正式動議通過、並議决委任國際委員會以利進行（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）荷蘭政府已接受國聯之邀請派遣隊伍參加國際警隊、以維持薩爾公民投票時之秩序、但駐荷京路透訪員曾以荷蘭將否派遣軍隊一事詢諸當局、當局人員加以否認、謂此種官方之磋商、尙未開始云、法政府今日宣稱、凡赴薩爾任維持秩序責任之國際警兵、經過法境、一律免除運費云、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>赫斯演說法德恊調可能</h3>
<p>兩國見解已轉變</p>
<p>波呼默國社黨中央委員會主席不管部閣員赫斯在此間數千人之大會前發表演說、謂「法國對德態度之改變、使德國對於法國問題之態度亦隨之而轉變、當法國派兵佔領魯爾區域時、吾人堅信法國欲以種種方法毁滅德國、但德國人現已不復抱此種見解矣、吾人現信法德兩國確有恊調之可能、法國歐戰參戰軍人之來遊、其所發表之演說、以及他國參戰軍人之答復、皆足以證實吾人和平之口號、余不信戰爭已迫在眉睫、蓋我輩德國人對於外交政策之演進、處以鎭靜、且各國政治家之眞正代表民衆者、亦决不致鼓動戰爭故也」云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法俄商約成立</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）法國商務部長馬尙陶、日前來俄、研究發展法俄兩國商務之辦法、連日與國外貿易人民委員羅森哥資直接商談、頗爲欵洽、大約雙方將於明日簽訂議定書、將所商定各點、予以紀錄、馬氏定於今晚啟程逕返巴黎、途中並不停留、俾星期二晚趕到、任全國市長大會之主席云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）法國商業部長馬尙陶與蘇聯國外貿易人民委員羅森哥資定於今晚簽訂議定書、規定法俄兩國立卽開始談判、以謀簽訂法俄通商航行條約、聞馬尙陶此行、除經濟結果後、並就政治方面、與蘇聯政府有所磋商、對於法俄合作之增進、頗多盡力云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意與阿比西尼亞互詰衝突責任</h3>
<p>意轟炸機鎭定騷亂</p>
<p>（倫敦）意與阿比西尼亞對於此次東非意屬地邊境發生衝突之責任、現仍互相詰責、意政府曾向阿比西尼亞政府要求滿意之答復、阿比西尼亞駐意代辦則奉令提出嚴重抗議、指此次衝突係意屬索瑪利綸軍隊由意軍官指揮　護送一英員與阿索平委員會之阿比西尼亞軍隊攻擊所致、據謂英員與委員會當抵維魯亞魯亞時、卽與一意國軍官指揮之軍隊八百人相遇、該意軍官拒絶阿索平委員會在阿國邊境搭　營帳、並由意屬地召來坦克車飛機及軍隊以阻止委員會進行其工作、英員雖加以調解、但未有效果、致情形惡化、遂起衝突云、據英政府所得之報告、證實英屬索瑪利綸所派遣之人員確有受驚情事、但駐阿比西尼亞之英使報告、並未述及詳情、查阿索平委員會係奉命討論土人牧塲之權利者、不時經過邊境、對於意阿兩國領土之爭執、毫無關係、當意阿兩國衝突時、有意人六十餘名陣亡、並傷四百人、衆信阿方死傷必重、阿國軍隊於意軍及轟炸飛機來援後、卽潰散而走、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>德國新巡艦下水</h3>

<h3>新加坡警察查究日人間諜案</h3>
<p>兩日人自歐來行徑離奇</p>
<p>西原尋覓神秘皮包猝斃</p>
<p>倫敦消息稱有海軍人員</p>
<p>新加坡新加坡警務當局現正調查若干日人之活動、此事已引起民衆之警駭、日來此間警署之政治情報處、大爲忙碌、民衆極加注意、雖當局諱莫如深、然衆信必與間諜事有關、先是上星期四日忽傳新加坡日僑恊會會長西原死於警署特别科之辦公所、西原被傳至署訊問星期初蒞新加坡之某日人所携奇異皮包之着落、西原到署後兩分鐘、卽倒地而死、現正從事剖騐、結果未悉、此案詳情、現尙無從探悉、惟衆信實起於歐洲來此之二日人、其一未接護照、向訊、則稱在西原處、後查知確在西原處、但在郵船啟行以前、屬於該日人之皮包一件、不知下落、致引起警察之疑心、乃續事查究、迨該二人重登郵船後、乃傳西原至警署特别科辦公所續加訊問、翌日、又傳二日人一爲彫刻師、一爲新加坡日文報副編輯、已由當局下驅逐令、加以覊留、於是衆益驚駭、警署雖非拒絶發表一切消息、但昨日曾窮搜此間日旅館與日僑住所、盤詰日僑多人、但未逮捕一人、聞凡寓有日僑各處、尙將繼續搜查、所覊留之二日人、何時押解出境、警署尙未發表日期、衆信將卽離境、至西原之暴卒、大約將在屋期四日前澈查、此間日僑對於當局覊留二國人、表示甚大之憾忱、惟以當局尙無明文解釋此舉、故日僑咸稱彼等對於內容、毫無所知云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）新加坡警察處理該處日僑活動事、現嚴守秘密、致倫敦人士頗多猜測、據可恃方面所傳之消息、若干日僑之活動、殆與間諜有關、聞其中有海軍人員、彼等在警察盤詰後、卽怱怱返日、預料其他日人若干、將被驅逐出境、因證據不足、難以起訴也、又有人稱、將在新加坡舉行之英國海軍會操因有此種發展、將秘密行之、但此說倫敦政界不承認、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>斐議會國防案由總督退回</p>
<p>（馬尼剌）斐律濱總督莫飛今日將斐島國防案退交議會複議、此事與總督實施否决權無異、總督附帶提出之節略稱、國防問題現在尙不迫切、蓋於斐島完全獨立前、美國仍負保護斐島之責、此時對於國防問題仍將從容研究也、惟擴充警隊及設立航空警備案則已由總督簽署矣、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（馬尼剌）美國參院研究各種經濟問題及斐律濱與美國將來之商務關係之調查團、參院屬地委員會主席泰定斯一行、今日已抵斐島、商界及政界領袖將設法使彼等明瞭斐島獨立法案中之經濟規定、殊有修改之必要、因該案限止斐島之糖、椰子油及繩索免稅輸美、並規定於獨立五年之後將徵收累進之出口稅也、各界領袖聲稱、此項累進稅必須免除、至於椰子油稅雖因對於斐島出產特别减輕、祗徵每磅五分、尙無大碍、亦經各方批評、斐島領袖希望將來之美斐貿易得有若干保證、商界贊成獨立之後成立互惠關係、因目前美國爲斐島產物最主要之市塲、而糖產一項幾全部運美也、參議員海登曾先行來此、作預備調查、彼曾表示國會已贊成互惠條約原則、維持現有之商業關係、至美斐貿易於斐島大爲有利、此間政界商界固亦知之、故已建議保護美國出產之法案、此項建議已得斐島總督莫飛及參院議長奎仁贊同、惟華盛頓方面因互惠政策尙在草創時代、表示不宜有何舉動、故上届議會之稅則起草委員會祇草擬一保護斐島產品及增加收入之議案、且於十一月八日議會閉幕之前、亦未將該案通過、明年初議會將舉行特會、該案或將在彼時提出云、（九日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本議會草草了事</h3>
<p>十五分鐘通過議案數十</p>
<p>（東京）今日之衆議院本會議猶大風一掃之後、議員出席者甚稀、於上午十一時十五分開會、槪括提出建議案二十六件請願二十五件、經全體一致通過、秋田議長致詞後於十一時三十分散會、（九日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）此次政府在臨時議會提出經成立之法律案如下、（一）都市計畫法改正法律案、（二）對風水災被害者之租稅减免猶豫等法律案、（三）政府所有未臨時交付凶作地之法律案、（四）昭和九年法律第五號中改正法律案預算案如下、（五）九年度歲出歲入總預算追加案、（六）九年度特别會計歲出預算追加案、以上諸法案附議十一日之定例閣議後卽日公佈、（九日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）第六十六臨時議會之貴族院會議九日上午十時十五分開會、審議災害救濟預算、岡田首相及其他閣員全部出席、議員席亦殆無空位、柳澤豫算委員長先報告委員會之經過及其結果後、開始質問、先由阪谷芳朗登壇、謂改革駐滿機關之問題、鑑於從來實際情形爲合理辦法、然今後日本與「滿洲國」應避免因滿鐵問題發生糾紛、從來規定除中日兩國外、不准所有滿鐵股票、日滿兩國利害關係相同、今後應准「滿洲國」所有滿鐵股票、政府有無留意此點、</p>
<p>岡田首相答、政府現正考慮滿鐵條令中、「滿洲國」所有滿鐵股票問題、可以考慮、阪谷所促政府早時實行條令之改正、於是開始討論前田利定責政府召開臨時議會之太遲後、謂災害預算中之土木事業費極少、希政府將來研究更澈底之救濟災害辦法、本預算內容雖不滿足、然因救濟事業特急、本人贊成其通過議會、</p>
<p>議長採决之結果通過、於是政府之災害預算完全成立、十一時五分散會、（九日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）岡田內閣首次召開之臨時議會已經閉幕、其目的雖在審議災害預算、然各政黨集中其攻力於政府實施之嚴正批判、政府當局極力防戰、延長會期通過災害預算二億一千萬元、决定免收災民租稅案、政府米臨時交付案、改革駐滿機關等各重要問題、議會會期雖不長、然其可决各案之重要性頗堪注目云、（九日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）衆議院波瀾重疊、延期會期凡兩次、通過政府預算案交付貴族院、貴族院委員會八日决定九日交正式會議可决、政府赤字公債案、關於政府所有米臨時交付災地之法律、都市計劃中改正案、對於風水災被害者免收租稅案等四件提案、已經通過兩院、九日之預算案圓滿可决、則臨時議會卽可結束、政府方面因岡田內閣之最初議會、其答辯不統、殊有危險性、然延長會期得平安通過一切提案、可謂成功、然政友會高唱政黨政治之復活、立憲政治之再來、與民政黨相提携、不料其在議會提出炸彈的動議、無力維持、遂屈服於軟弱內閣之前、暴露其無力態度、不但使其政黨政治復活之第一步工作完全失敗、且政黨信用與威力墜地、實爲議會政治可惜也、（九日日聯電）</p>
<h3>美亦實行禁毒</h3>
<p>華僑八人被拘</p>
<p>（華盛頓）政府剪滅惡棍匪徒運動復獲成功、財政部密探奉令緝捕毒品私販、全國同時着手、已拘獲五百餘人、並搜得毒品無數、政府已决意剪滅有組織之惡黨、深信欲逹此目的、必先剷除毒品販賣、此次緝捕在巴爾的摩爾城中竟由財長毛根韜親自指揮、可見政府認眞辦理之一斑、緝捕之後、由財部毒品局長亞斯令傑詳細審詢、亞氏稱、「審詢結果甚爲滿意、此次緝捕卽使未能完全剷除毒販、然亦可使此中領袖深長思矣」云云捕獲之販毒犯中有華僑八人、據稱搜獲者爲鴉片、大槪拘捕人數最後將逹一千、尙有一事頗足注意、卽全國犯罪會議不久將在華盛頓舉行、届時聯邦及各州探員將設計合力剷除惡棍匪徒之最善方法、而此次大捕毒犯適在會議之前舉行云（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>玻璃維亞全國總動員</h3>
<p>準備與巴軍决戰</p>
<p>拉巴斯玻璃維亞內閣下令全國總動員以防止軍隊完全失敗、總動員將於星期日或星期一實行、此次動員包括後備軍全體人員係一年半前戰事發生以來最普遍之動員令、內閣現抱擊退巴拉圭軍隊之决心、並已與軍事領袖密切合作、以使前敵軍隊得有全國最充份之後盾、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>阿根廷京城據亞松遜官報巴拉圭軍隊右翼突施襲擊、玻璃維亞軍隊已有七師全部瓦解、愛斯太葛拉將軍亦稱、數日血戰結果、彼之軍隊已佔領大厦谷煤油區之門户維拉蒙脫之衝要地點、而畢古比亞·龍維斯太撤·及伊倫大主亞三處砲台亦已陷落云、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>太平洋防務與造艦競爭</h3>
<p>日報論海軍會議失敗後趨勢</p>
<p>東京國民新聞二日報載稱、此次倫敦海軍會議之失敗及日本廢棄華府條約已爲旣定之事實、英美以失敗之責任歸之日本、美國並堅持五·五·三比率、以不辭建艦競爭相恫喝、茲就會議决裂後、研究太平洋上防備擴張之影響於下、按華盛頓條約曾規定（一）美國在太平洋現在領有與將來應取得之島嶼、（除阿拉斯加與接近巴拿馬運河地帶之島嶼及檀香山羣島等外）（二）英國在東經百十度以東之太平洋現在領有與將來可取得之屬地、（除接近加拿大之島嶼與澳洲聯邦·及新西蘭等外）（三）日本在太平洋之島嶼領土及屬地、（卽千島羣島·小笠原羣島·奄美大島·琉羣球島·台灣·澎湖諸島、並日本將來在太平洋上可取得之島嶼領土及屬地、（規定防備施設之現狀維持、然而此等防備制限、實以日本爲中心、而以西太平洋之防備爲限、並未涉及東太平洋與南太平洋、條約廢棄後、當然撤廢防備制限、彼時將有進擊日本之機會、减少日本防禦力、一方日本亦可離島嶼遙遠之處、加以防備、此日本之所以不得不廢棄條約也、但條約旣廢、繼而起者、爲建艦競爭、換言之、在條約存續期內一、九三六年末爲限、均應嚴守規定、廢棄後、各國得任意造艦、不過造艦、以今日之工業力、無論何國、主力艦須經四年、一萬噸巡洋艦三年、驅逐艦一年以內、然而各國雖欲競爭建艦、無如國力有限、究竟能否實行、尙屬疑問、例如美國自一九二九年以來、國內非常恐慌、美國民之所得總額、在大戰前爲八百五十億元、今日祗三百五十億元、國債額中央政府與各洲合計四百八十億元、海外投資額爲三百億元、今美國欲確立世界第一海軍、其經費全部、以救濟失業爲名、由匡救土木費中支出、故赤字公債遞增、彌縫財政、頓感拮据、因此美國議會對於恊贊建艦費、依照國內情勢、究不能逹到世界第一海軍國之目的、英國亦然、加以海軍士官之養成、每人至少須經十年之訓練、下士官亦須六年、其他航空士兵、須經五年以上之學習、然英美二國素採傭兵制度與志願兵制度、美國迄今、尙未改革兵制、故對於人員、尤感缺乏、由現在各國建艦情况觀之、照現存條約、如繼續至一九三六年以後、美國有航空母艦三萬噸、巡洋艦六萬噸、驅逐艦七萬噸、潛水艦二萬餘噸、合計十九萬餘噸、尙不足條約中規定量五十二餘萬噸、今爲補充建造、每年之建造量、須八萬噸、英國至一九三六年末、尙與條約量不足十萬噸、如此大建艦計劃、恐非容易推行、况今日美國、如實行三年計劃及五年計劃之建艦、至一九三九年末、每月須新造二隻、合計爲百三十九隻、更爲難能、綜上而觀、所謂建艦競爭、不過推測之談、在事實上仍極困難耳、</p>
<h3>薩爾印象記</h3>
<p>（國民新聞社德國通訊）柏林大學畢業生喬祺森赴薩爾旅行、所得印象甚多、業已返德、向記者發表如下之談話、本年冬季、歐洲最難解决之政治問題、厥爲薩爾問題、因薩爾人民、至明年一月十三日、須投票决定、應歸屬德國、或歸屬法國、抑仍保持現狀、此乃歐洲各國所注意之事件也、平心而論、薩爾原應屬於德國、不獨該地居民之言語與德國相同、卽文化及生活亦無稍異、故薩爾人民皆願歸向德國、薩爾民意、已親向德國、本不成其他問題、然其又致發生薩爾問題者、豈非歐洲政治所使然歟、</p>
<p>由是觀之、薩爾人民親向德國、皆欲爲希特勒之同志、事實昭然、此足以證明、希特勒之對外親善和平政策、比之他國虛僞高壓手段、顯有分别矣、余之薩爾旅行也、時在德意志新政府甫告成立、恢復國旗、希特勒選舉勝利之日、抵薩爾橋與薩爾羅易士時、見該兩處地方、懸有甚多國社黨旗、及黑白藍德國國旗、據余所聞、於薩爾則僅有法國之機關始懸黑白藍之法國旗、薩爾人民之懸德國旗、乃爲居民同情希特勒之標誌、此種同情心、卽至明年投票時、想亦不致散失也、一國之內、該國現政府、並未慫恿人民應懸某國之國旗、而人民自動懸德國旗、此足見該國人民將來之意志、誰人亦莫能阻止之、世之善觀察事理者、應重視人民之意志、今薩爾人民、盡欲爲希特勒之同志、此誠足表示該處人民之狂熱迷戀之心、比之柏林人、更加甚焉、柏林亦於同一狀况之下、每至星期五均懸掛黨旗國旗、</p>
<p>余此次旅行於梅恩茲車站、首次遇見一位薩爾女人、斯時余在車站候車、女人甚爲樸素、彼向一位德國女人奪步、前來月台、詢余曰「君亦願往薩爾橋乎、余欣然應之、於是此位薩爾女人慨然詳告薩爾之情形、因其子就學於梅恩茲學校、此行係携子回家、余於此又得一番政治之認識矣、彼云如下、「吾原爲德匣人之母親、故不願子弟赴法求學、薩爾人民、皆願歸屬德國、吾乃一農家婦女、尤於吾等農人、更願傾向德國、吾人每欲棄家投向德意志祖國、因吾人在家無國家所轄、儼若無籍之人、吾人爲德國徙居之民、薩爾之生活程度、比德國尤高、吾人深知、若投回祖國、固然經濟情狀、更見困難、但爲國犧牲、亦所不惜、至於羅特麟之農人、境遇尤劣、比之吾人更下幾倍、僅能糊口而已、但久缺衣裳矣、若吾人出境視人、則見法國人衣服華彩、德國人之清潔樸實、」</p>
<p>車抵薩爾、余卽與此位薩爾農婦道别、并感伊對余述薩爾之情形、德國與薩爾交界處、爲南哺爾車站、自歐戰告終訂立條約後、薩爾則屬於法國稅關區、故該處法國設有關稅檢查處、余待關稅檢騐放行後、卽往車站、欲購食物、惟法國之稅吏用法語呼余曰、「請勿行、在車中等等」余故意用德語應之「余往購食物」并欲試試在德國地方、德語果不能通行耶、</p>
<p>薩爾橋、爲薩爾之都城、仰見許多鮮明奪目之德國旗、</p>
<p>余過關後、於是卽注意法國鞋、當卽往四家鞋店探詢、惟所見者、盡屬德國鞋、價格比柏林較昻耳、當時余甚爲詫異、如何法國轄境內、而無法國鞋出售、且法國貨物進口關稅自由、不需納稅、其貨價當比德國爲廉、余正躊躇間、於是女店員爲余解釋、法國鞋雖廉、然薩爾人民、皆不欲購之、詢其故、伊復答云、因德國鞋爲國恥紀念品、且爲本國同胞所製造者、工料當更精實、由是可以推知、德國之貨物、在薩爾商塲上·尙佔優勝、</p>
<p>其次余在街道上見薩爾人民往來不絶、皆甚有特殊之德國風、</p>
<p>在街道上、余曾見甚多賣報者、詢以何種報紙、銷行最盛、其中一位賣報女答云、「薩爾橋人報與晚報」最多、此兩種報紙、在報紙首端、印有大號字、題爲「德國前鋒之機關、」德國前鋒無黨派之立塲、純屬致力國家社會之建設者、爲拯救現代德國之先導、至於晚報亦於該報首張有明顯之標語、「爲德國、反抗德或之敵人」此等措辭、實與現今德國國內人民所言者無異、－於是余繼詢之曰「爾果無法國報乎」賣報女答「此不問可知矣」至是余乃告别、此後余在薩爾各處、莫不發見薩爾人民之本質及性格、完全與德國相同、且薩爾人民、除希望歸合德國外、别無所願也、</p>

<h3>國聯十五届大會郭泰祺出席演說之全文（續八日）</h3>
<p>聲明中國對東北問題之立塲</p>
<p>當國聯大會十八個月前通過其報告書時、李頓調查委員團已、以其調查結果繕具報告提交大會、其中詳紀因日軍侵略造成之慘狀、末言、「滿洲在過去一年中、紛擾不已、此廣大富沃地方之人民所處之境况、與所遭之困苦、殆爲前所未嘗經歷者」云、今日局勢、更見惡化、此可以獨立方面莫能指摘之消息爲證、八月二十三日倫敦泰晤士報載其瀋陽訪員之來訊曰、「自八月六日以來、土匪平均每日施擊兩次「滿洲國」報紙今日亦載有一表臚列中柬鐵路東段一帶、橋樑被毁者三十一座、火車出軌傾覆者三十一次、車站被攻者九十一次、據此間外員所得消息觀之、外人今旅行於幹綫外者、爲匪襲擊之危險日甚」云、翌日卽八月二十四日、泰晤士報又載一海綫電、文曰、「關於「滿洲國」之許多公布文、輒冠以今治安秩序業已恢復等言、此種習聞之詞、就一日間所得匪警消息徵之、絶難置信、星期六日寓沙河子西北某村之韓人三十六名、在瀋陽附近北陵遭匪屠殺三十三名、星期三日日工人三名在吉圖鐵路上爲匪殺死、星期二日駛於北滿鐵路東段之鐵甲車一列、機車與火車四節出軌後、受匪攻擊」云、頃所引述之慘劇、皆發生於幹綫者、至滿洲其餘部分之狀况、大可想見矣、近者在僞帝自稱爲京都之宮邸、亦遭火焚、又正在所謂京都境外之日人最大飛行塲之一、亦於四月間第二次被焚爲平地、損失逹數百萬元、凡此諸端、皆足徵明散漫之戰事、其規模殊爲闊大、爲便揚惡計、稱之爲「匪」、滿洲當然有以匪爲業之不法分子、但就焚燒宮邸飛行塲、拆毁鐵路、攻擊軍隊與運兵火車而論、實爲受蹂躪的民衆反抗軍隊重大非法的壓迫之一種運動、若輩堅持其主義、不爲心灰、乃隨時隨地以作戰、迨機會一至、將起作最後之解放、滿洲今日之情狀、大要與九一八事變發生時相同、卽在彼之日陸軍今仍佔守各大城、及時時出兵懲治居民、以肆威嚇、是在外兵佔據之下、有恢復法紀治安而聽人成就繁榮之可能、此種理想、已爲事實所打消、而實鄙薄歷史上之敎訓也、破壞條約佔據吾國東北諸省之反響、不僅限於遠東、全歐各國之關心其本國界綫或本國之安全者、咸因諸國聯中國仍不能有所作爲、或曾有作爲、過嫌懦弱、以贊助國聯所布之裁决、而受損害矣第蔓延之後果、非純屬惡的方面、蘇聯之將加入國聯、及國聯與美國合作、更見密切、至少可謂其一部分原因、乃由遠東事變緊急所致、再遠東在世界事務中日見重要、今已受人更鮮明更廣大之承認矣、今謂世界政治之重心、已由歐洲移至遠東、容或言過其實、至太平洋今漸成世界風雲之中心點、則確爲令人可悲之事實、所不幸者、繼續以武力佔據吾國東北諸省之舉、已成爲今日世界中第二次大戰最急之危險、此實毫無疑義、遠東戰爭之危險、與歐洲和平之前途、有密切不可判分之關係、此亦漸見顯明者也、</p>
<p>中國代表在世界經濟會議中曾請衆注意中國市塲之潛能性、及中國政府已藉國聯技術的合作實施國家復興之徫大程序、此項程序、諸君在國聯技術專員之報告書中可見之「包括國家復興之各項、如公路之建築、絲茶棉之改良、與夫文化敎育衛生種種、目下國聯專家在華者、僅數人、專事調查、作技術性而全與政治爭案無關之設計、政府現所進行天空與鐵路運輸之發展、及拒毒之嚴厲運動、與夫其他復興事業、雖未受國聯之技術合作、但均在國家復興總計畫範圍之內、至於由此種工作謀獲最有益之效果、用何方法、此顯然純屬內國政策問題、應由操主權之中國决定而實行之、他國毫無理由或任何權利干涉此種政策、中國所引以爲慰者、關於此端之中國地位、已獲關切東西合作政策之諸國全體贊助、此可以四月間東京宣言發表後列强政府所取之行動證明者也、中國政府現仍從事奮鬥、以抗重大困難、而待成立工作、亦殊艱鉅、但吾人現覺已足踏實地、已向正當之方面前趨、假以時日、必獲成功、如國際和平能加保持、則中國之進步必穩固而迅速也、</p>
<p>余今已力求簡明、以質樸寫實主義之精神、將中國政府所視爲世界大局與遠東問題及國聯目的之關係的顯著各點、陳述於諸君之前、中國以國聯及東西合作全部計畫之前哨自居、此種情感、已由非吾人所願有而使吾人爲主要受害者之情勢所增固、蓋中國在已往十八個月中、已成國聯行政院中遠東之唯一代表矣、吾人願在技術與政治範圍中鞏固吾人與國聯之一切連鎖、藉以抵抗彼將迫令吾人轉背向西、及迫令吾人加入負「亞洲爲亞洲人的」名義之一種純粹不平等的組合者所施之壓力、吾人不信世界應按大陸與種族畫爲不透水之若干部分、吾人深信和平僅能藉國聯而保持之、國聯爲普遍性的、其組織不以世界地理大區域爲分野、故得立於堅不可㧞之地位、中國人民恒信任國際公道、此所以雖歷遭種種失望與挫衂、而對國聯之忠貞、卒未稍渝、且决計盡所有之權力、擁護國聯盟約、並堅守和平之途徑也、</p>
<p>余今將作一結語以固國聯之力量、並示將來之希望、中國爲亞洲之基礎、果爾則俄國當爲歐亞兩洲聯合的拱門、中國熱切歡迎俄國立卽加入國聯之希望、俄國在軍縮會中之戮力工作、實爲其將加入國聯所佔勢力之好兆、俄國曾貢獻侵略者最明切之定義、中俄夙相鄰處、其接界綫之袤遠、實冠歐亞、吾人於遠東與太平洋和平之保持、有共同之關係、自今以後、吾人經營和平之共同努力、能在國聯機構之內相提携、此實不勝欣幸者也、（完）</p>

<h3>劉仲英談籌備贛省國展經過</h3>
<p>本市中華國產廠商聯合會、領導會員廠商、參加江西省會國貨展覽會、中間因該省商界誤會、至一再延期、籌備時間、竟逹三個月、茲悉已於本月八日正式開幕、昨據該會常委劉仲英詳述參加贛展經過、茲特分誌如下、</p>
<p>發起組織據云、此次舉行江西國展會、原爲本會發起、曾經函電贛省各黨政機關同意、當經該省謁力贊助、迭電歡迎（曾誌報端）乃由本會派員赴贛、會同贛省各界籌備、先由江西省黨部省政府召集江西各機關代表曁本會代表聯席會議議决舉行、並組織江西國貨展覽籌備會、關於廠商用費、如搭棚電費一切由本會供給、贛方籌備費用、由贛方各機關負責、雙方均以提倡國貨、挽回利權爲目標、共同恊力進行、</p>
<p>開始籌備劉君又云、本會代表、自經聯席會議議决舉行後、即根據接洽經過、及聯席會議議案返滬報告、本會以贛省各界、旣肯如此贊助、爲國貨前途計、自應努力進行、乃於九月二十日、經本會常務會議議决發表、開始籌備、並通告會員廠商登記參加、而各會員以江西爲新生活運動發源地、對提倡國貨宣傳、其收效定較偉大、故亦都樂予贊助、踴躍參加、將及一週、規定行業一百五十家、均告額滿、</p>
<p>中途阻力又云、本會自進行籌備後、因得江西各機關贊助、故會員亦踴躍參加、遂决定雙十節國展會開幕、一面特再派代表赴贛建築會塲、積極佈置、詎意籌備正在積極進行時、江西市商會各業公會忽以傾銷誤會、紛電本市及贛省黨政機關要求撤銷議案、阻止舉行、本會以此次贛展、雖由本會發起、而得有贛省各機關贊助、而組織者、且贛省黨部省政府召開各機關代表聯席會議、江西市商會、亦派有代表周子實君、出席與議、在會議間、各代表非惟毫無反對之詞、且均竭力贊助發起、今該市商會曁各業公公、忽在本會籌備已將成立、而突然反對、豈非兒戲、乃即根據理由、紛電各關係機關力爭、而國展會開幕、遂因此而一再展延、直至本月八日、始得實行、</p>
<p>交涉經過又云、江西市商會曁各同業公會之反對、經本會抗爭後、江西黨政各機關、均將該市商會曁各同業公會之反對、予以駁復、而贛方心猶不服、乃要求徵收公益捐（値百抽十）及要求廠商津貼贛方辦公費、（値百抽二）及以種種之不堪條件爲要挾、故意留難、本會以展覽國貨、根據實業部規定、並不微稅抽捐、且可豁免國營舟車運輸各費、至贛方辦公費、業經代表議决、由贛方負責、今贛省竟巧立名目、朦請苛徵暴歛、及不遵議决案、實有違反中央規定國貨運動之原旨、乃根據部令規章、及依據各地國展先例、請求豁免後、而贛方仍堅請津貼辦公費一千猶懸而未决、此實爲國貨運動從來未有之不幸現象也、</p>
<p>開幕情况又云、贛省自發生誤會中途擱置後、開幕日屢經展延、此次確定本月八日開幕、因持届年關、實不能再事延期、故本會决一面先行如期開幕、一面則根據代表會議决案、再向各關係機關繼續抗爭、昨據本會江西代表航訊、贛展開幕日、由熊主席夫人揭幕、並由熊主席曁各界領袖及廠商代表數百人、蒞會致詞、儀節非常隆重、而江西民衆到會參觀購貨者、亦殊熱烈、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　諂笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴飢腸　迨紛敷學風流</p>
<p>這最後幾句話算是打動了月英的心，没有作聲。胡嫂子看着是機會了，提起熱水壺，向盆裏斟去，摔了把手巾，就要向他臉上搽去。月英接着手巾，站起來歎口氣道：唉！我來罷。他到底是個聰明女孩子，現成的化妝品在這裏，又經胡嫂子在一邊指點，費子三十分鐘的工夫，也就把臉貌重新修飾過來了。只待他把一件花洋標的旗衫穿起，小紀就推門進來了。這樣的巧，他必是在外面偸看了，羞得月英立刻背轉身去。小紀向胡嫂子笑道：這一着用得，若是在賈老爺面前，還來這一下，準得他喜歡。月英氣不過，就轉過身來，板住了臉。小紀却也不管他，向他對着看了看，笑道：倒是行，只是鼻子上的粉，還没有撲匀。你看我的。說着，他左手舉了小鏡子，右手在粉匣子裏拿起粉撲子來，在臉上鼻子上，亂撲了一頓。撲粉的時候，頭對了鏡子，還左右扭了幾扭。月英雖是十二分難過，也忍不住笑了。他倒不在　乎，將鏡子同粉撲，一齊交給了月英，笑道：你來罷。自己拿起月英用過了的手巾，很隨便的在臉上一摸。月英手上拿着粉撲，倒發了楞。小紀道：怎麽了？你再匀匀臉上的粉，我們好走哇！月英回頭看看胡嫂子，也默然的不作聲。他一想，旣是搽粉了，就要搽得好一點。風流就風流，下流就下流，反正比餓着肚子等死好些。於是學了小紀那樣子，將粉撲蘸好了粉，對了鏡子，向兩腮和鼻子尖上撲着。小紀暗暗點頭呌好。然而月英心裏，可比刀割還難過呢。大槪天下胭脂粉滿臉的女人，不見得都是快活的呵。（八五）</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （雄宇）</p>
<p>每日能大笑一次，有益衛生，此理固人人知之；獨吾謂每日能大哭一次，其益當較笑爲尤勝。</p>
<p>蓋舉抑塞磊落之胸襟，無自排洩，并欲笑而不可得者，槪以一哭了之，則塊壘頓消矣。</p>
<h3>王頭馮臂</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>民國二年的春節，咱們校長馮冰叟，與馮死公，馮伏跗諸先生，到吾鄉北郭外一個荒蕪的土饅頭餡去祭掃。咱問這土饅頭餡，是不是懷才不遇的奇士，還是氷清玉潔的貞女，爲甚麽激動鄉先生來憑弔呢？</p>
<p>原來那個土饅頭餡，並没有整個的屍體，只有一隻臂膀，跟一個頭顱。頭顱是王先生的，臂膀是馮先生的。咱的朋友這樣說。</p>
<p>哦！原來是兩位民族英雄的墓啊！王先生名篤庵，馮先生名覃溪，都是跟了張蒼水公抵清兵殉難的。後人只找得馮先生的一隻臂膀，王先生的一個頭顱，愍其忠義，把他們合葬起來，留爲紀念。朋友又這樣說，咱方纔明白。</p>
<p>當南都旣覆，吾鄉張蒼水和錢肅樂等，奉魯王監國。忠義民軍，屢抗清師，清庭很懼。後來張公勸鄭延平取南京，自崇明入江，所向克捷。張公先移師上游，直取九江，軍威很盛。後來延平退敗，魯王也死了；那位跟張公倡義的王篤庵，一日，忽然和他妻子吵鬧起來，詬誶勃谿，鬧得天翻地覆。結果，把他的妻子，送歸娘家，永遠脫離關繫。隣近的人，見了十分納罕，以爲王先生是位義士，對於渾家，爲甚麽這樣的不義吓。心裏莫不疑訝。</p>
<p>後來張蒼水公散兵隱居舟山小島，爲清兵偵得，不屈而死，王馮兩先生當然也是殉難，不像洪承疇，錢牧齋這一般人，甘心做二臣啊！王先生旣被清軍所殺，他忍心休妻這回事，方才明白他的苦衷。</p>
<h3>野鴨</h3>
<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>初冬傍晚的時候，野鴨打着羣兒飛翔在灰黯遼闊的天空，聲音那末嘹喨，好似合着像的飛機排列着在前進。</p>
<p>天氣寒冷了，它們覺着北地嚴冷而凍餒，只得勞振着雙翼，來希冀着生命的苟活。可是，它們的生命還是傷亡在南方漁人的手裏。</p>
<p>野鴨又上市了，漁人臉上堆着微笑，不慣吃野味的人也誰都要嘗些味兒啦。</p>
<p>在故鄉東山這季節是漁人旺捕野鴨的時節，有專做鴨販子的行販，他們出着低廉的價本，收買了再銷到蘇州，上海，在東山不過千來文一對，銷到外邊就値一元左右一對了，販子一轉手之勞，利潤到反比漁人多得不少。</p>
<p>太湖邊的蘆塘裏，淺灘處，漁人各自守着地域，鋪着網，扳着弓，放着幾隻做「引子」的野鴨，他們釘着銳厲的眼珠子，全神貫注地仰望着天空，等着，等着，野鴨羣飛來了，揪着「引子鴨」使它們呌，飛的鴨聽到了下邊的呌聲，自會自投羅網的飛下來了。</p>
<p>網兒鋪在蘆塘裏，鴨兒飛進了網，把繩兒收一下一隻隻都捲入了網中，扳弓的把一半竹竿插入泥裏，每竿離開丈來遠，竿頭緊着繩，繩兒打着鬆弛的圈，用另一根繩把竹竿扳倒着，到時候把扳倒的繩兒鬆掉，竹竿豎直，一隻隻野鴨的頭，足，翼膀扣住了，所以只有東山有活的野鴨買到。</p>
<p>野鴨還有一種呌「長江貨」，像上海野味店賣的泰半都來自長江，據說「長江貨」不像東山那樣捕的，他們用獵槍打，用毒質的藥末拌着食物鋪在海灘上藥死的，野鴨飛到海灘上找食吃，吃到了這毒質的食料就倒斃了，漁人只要到天明隨手去拾，所以就没有東山貨那般新鮮而味美。</p>

<p>豆腐乾，一名香乾，和落花生一同吃，味極雋美，所以又呌做素火腿，而且價目也很便宜。但製法最精的，要算我們紹興的柯橋，你倘然在紹蕭公路或杭江鐵路各站路過，一定可以聽到小販們的呌賣柯橋豆腐乾的呼聲，這眞可以當得起「價廉物美，四海馳名，」八個字，毫無愧色了。</p>
<p>說到柯橋豆腐乾，還有一個很可笑的掌故，那就是「殿基」與「田鷄」的誤解。原來柯橋賣豆腐乾的店家，雖然不止一家，雖然不止一家，但其中最著名的，要算殿基弄的豆腐店，所以外路客人，凡是來買豆腐乾的，只曉得殿基弄豆腐乾，反而把它的店那忘記了，追溯這殿基弄的名義，是因爲此處本來有一座張神殿的，後來不知什麽時候這座張神殿毁滅了，只有一個殿基，所以這條弄就呌做殿基弄。（現在不但没有殿基的遺跡，就是這殿基弄也没有了，）但是，外路人不知原委，誤把殿基認作田鷄；而且還要裝點出一個謠言，說：柯橋田鷄弄，因爲田鷄很多，所以出名，這家豆腐店，是將弄內田鷄，捉來煮湯，作爲豆腐乾的汁水，所以它的豆腐乾，特别的鮮美，累得吃素老太太疑心得不敢吃，你想這件事，可笑不可笑呢？</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>太后走進了這一座宮院之後，突然像失了知覺一樣，眼睛老是直向前面望着，走路也極不自然，僵硬得和夢中行走的人毫無差别。可是伊的頰上却並没有半些眼淚。伊只像犯了失心瘋似的忽而走到左邊的一口玻璃匣子邊去看看，忽而又旋到右邊的一口旁去望望；或是看過了再去看一次，二次，三次，以至於無數次。尤其使伊難堪的是咸豐的遺物竟是特别的少，不但不能和乾隆的比，便是和其他各代的帝皇比，也相差甚遠，可說是比較最少的一部份了！簡直少得可憐！這是什麽緣故呢？說來很單純。我們這些人可說是没有不知道的。或者本書的讀者中，也不乏明瞭的人。簡單的說起來，就是因爲這位大皇帝的生前，一味只知道享樂，賭錢啊，喝酒啊，差不多全是他的日常功課；此外，此外，更無須隱瞞，他還有貪色的嗜好。一個人有了這許多的惡習慣，當然是不能再熟諳什麽文藝或武事了；而他分內所應理的朝政，也全部給荒廢了。嚴格的論起來，清朝的所以衰弱不振，以致於覆亡，最初的一顆種子，正不妨說就是他老人家所播種下去的。至少，没有人能够替他辯護，說他不是一個毫無作爲的昏君！</p>
<p>當我們一路從前面那兩座宮院中參觀過來的時候，因瞧太后指東說西地講得很高興，大家不覺也忘了畏忌，紛紛的發出各種問題來，或是直接請問伊老人家，或是兩個人自己互相討論着，情形眞是非常熱閙；但一到了這裏，我們偸瞧伊的顏色不對，趕快自動的識趣起來，各人都竭力的忍耐着，不敢說一句話（一九五）</p>

<h3>木槿與木瓜</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>（一）木槿</p>
<p>有女同車，顏如舜英，蓋以槿華喩女子之美色也，木槿爲落葉小灌木，高六七尺，枝葉婆婆，自夏秋之交開花，入冬不絶，故徐凝有誰道槿花生感促，可憐相計半年紅之句，花有紅白紫黃數色，五瓣短柄如蜀葵，日光所爍，疑有燄生，因有朝菌之號。其他别名，如佛桑，扶桑，玉蒸，目及皆是。或云，舜英即純白無間之花也。</p>
<p>花以重瓣者佳，單瓣者祗堪編插成籬，因名籬槿，花之最下者。據云：編籬時須連插，不可住手，如斷續爲之，則難活。未知確否，殊不可以理解也。</p>
<p>木槿嫩葉，可代茶飲。閩之汀州人，以槿花拌麵煎食，遂呼爲麵花。又虞衝志云：采紅木槿，連葉包裏黃梅，鹽漬暴乾以薦酒，故名玉修。</p>
<p>嶺南紅槿，自正月迄十二月常開，見嶺南異物志，終歲爛漫，的是可愛，其殆以南方氣候燠暖之故歟？</p>
<p>木槿詩不多見，崔道融云：槿花不多見，一日一回新。楊凌云：向晚爭辭蕊，迎朝門發花。李商隱云：殷鮮一相雜，啼笑兩難分。楊萬里云：夾路疏籬錦作堆，朝開暮落復朝開。予所招錄，僅此而已。</p>
<p>（二）木瓜</p>
<p>書齋清供，香櫞佛手外，木瓜尙已·木瓜爲落葉灌木，幹高六七尺，先花後葉，花分紅白二色，美艶殊常。實形橢圓，皮黃似著粉，小於槇𣚛，香氣甚烈。</p>
<p>木瓜一名楙，一名鐵脚犁，方與勝覽云：木瓜華時有蛇盤糾，至實落供大士乃去，號爲護聖瓜。</p>
<p>宣州產木瓜著名，故丘濬謝送木瓜詩，有經霜著雨玉枝疏，除却宣城總不如之句。其地種瓜滿山，每結實，好事者鏤紙花黏瓜上，夜露日照，花紋宛然，名爲繡瓜，又號花木瓜。帝制時代，常以入貢。昔汪彥章與王甫太學同舍，王甫貌美中空，彥章稱之爲花木瓜，蓋譏之也。</p>
<p>木瓜可種可接，可以條壓。春末開花，若移栽，則以秋社前後爲宜。畏日喜肥，壅以犬糞，自然蕃茂，其枝條之挺直者，可以作杖，老人持之，有利筋舒脈之功。</p>
<p>藏木瓜法，將木瓜曝乾，投於密瓶中，可以經久馨逸，不致敗爛。木瓜味酸濇，然亦可食垂。明皇雜記：元獻皇后思食酸味，張說因進經，袖出木瓜以獻。將木瓜生切去皮，煮熟之，多換水浸，俾去酸濇之味，然後用蜜熬煎，便爲蜜漬木瓜。又木瓜浸酒，亦爲佳品。</p>
<p>炙木瓜成灰，魚食之即死。三國典略云：齊孝昭北伐庫莫奚，至天池，以木瓜灰毒魚。</p>

<h3>世界經濟恐慌與中國貨幣</h3>
<p>— 黃憲章講陳夷如記</p>
<p>（一）世界經濟恐慌的原因－</p>
<p>（Ａ）金融資本主義內國的矛盾：這個恐慌的主要原因，當然是整個的制度問題，我們要曉得，在現代這種金融資本主義的動向，千方百計，無非替自己的利害打算：如怎樣實行合理化的管理？怎樣提高生產率？總而言之，僅可能的要把自己的利潤率擴大，越大越好。因此在這樣金融資本主義組織下的各產業部門，瘋狂般的作投機的競爭，以致生產不能保持與社會一般的供給和需要的平衡·一方形成生產過剩；他方被雇傭的勞動羣衆，因受着生產過剩的影響，由工廠中被排擠出來，一個一個地加入了失業者羣的隊伍·失業的恐慌，普遍地開展着，形成各資本主義內國的一種經常現象，循環連繫，没有己時。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）金融資本主義國際的矛盾：因爲生產技術的進步與資本的擴大，生產品的數量和種類，亦大形增加，在國內市塲上，逐漸凝滯，勢必向外推銷，藉圖自國的繁榮。這樣一來，於是彼此都盡量强迫輸出限制輸入：市塲競爭，日趨嚴重，彼此都採取保護貿易的方法，實爲一種必要的手段。最後弄到大家都以其國家的政治領域爲界限，排擠外國商品，不許外國商品自由輸入，國際的關稅戰爭和額定制的輸入限制應運而起·商品流通，遂遭受了莫大的阻碍。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）戰債與賠欵的負膽：世界大戰以後，德國依照凡爾賽條約，除喪失領土及殖民地屬地外，一切國家普通人民在大戰中所受的損失，都要德國賠償。經過多少此的會議及各樣賠欵計劃制定後，從一九二四年到一九二八年，才算到逹的所謂「標準年度」，從那時開始，德國每年就要支付二十五萬萬金馬克的賠欵，可是德國在大戰的疲敝，怎能負擔得起這麽大的賠欵呢？同時，因爲歐洲各國大都是美國的債務人，德國的賠欵大部份又輾轉流入美國。不過法國收受的賠欵較多！而償付的債務較少，故其金融狀况，比較的優於其他歐洲各國。因此，大量的金貨統通麕集在美法兩國。茲將一九三二年九月份美法兩國存金的數量與歐洲各國的存金的數量列表如下（單位百萬）：</p>
<p>美國一九三三年九月四·一九○</p>
<p>法國一九三二年六月三·二○○</p>
<p>英國一九三二年六月六○○</p>
<p>德國一九三二年六月一九六</p>
<p>日本一九三二年六月一一五</p>
<p>觀上表，我們就可以知道美法所存的金貨已逹到很大的數量。在美法兩國有着黃金過剩的恐慌，而在歐洲各國，倒鬧着黃金的缺乏，以致通貨縮緊，購買力大形縮减。</p>
<p>（Ｄ）蘇聯與遠東各國及各殖民地對歐美輸入之縮减：</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯昔爲資本主義各國的一個重要的市塲，因爲國內没有像歐洲各資本先進國那麽發逹的產業，差不多大部份的工業製造品，都仰賴於各資本主義國家的供給：而各資本主義國以其過剩的商品，很可以向着這龐大的產業不發逹的蘇聯輸送。但是一到了第一次五年計劃成功以後，情勢就急轉直下，較之往昔，殆難同日而語·即蘇聯對於各資本主義國輸入的商品，不但不視爲必要，而且他自己的各種工業的生產，却銳利的衝入世界帝國主義的市塲，與之猛烈的競爭起來。這點也是降低歐洲貿易輸出，東方市塲購買力爲之疲弱的一大原因。</p>
<p>（二）遠東各國，尤其是中國的農村經濟，因歷年感受着外貨傾銷的影響，致農產品價格分外低落·而農村經濟，必然的日就枯竭，無法可以收拾。不論外貨怎樣充斥市塲，不論怎樣努力傾銷，也没有方法使購買力可以回復起來。而且遠東各國大半係用銀圓，當一九二八年突然低落以後，因對於金本位國貨幣比價的相對低落，一般的購買力又大爲縮减，以致各資本主義國的對外輸出，也隨之縮减。</p>
<p>二各國對世界經濟恐慌的對策</p>
<p>各國對於經濟恐慌的政策，因其特殊情形之不同，當然不能完全一樣，不過我們可以歸納起來，分爲下列五項：</p>
<p>Ａ减少生產量，差不多成爲各金融資本主義國的一種普通辦法；據一九三二年德國景象研究所的調查，全世界的生產量，已减低到百分之三十以上。</p>
<p>Ｂ加重保護主義的關稅，與國際貿易的統制。</p>
<p>Ｃ放棄金本位制，美國首先禁金出口，接着就放棄金本位。英國也步着美國的後塵，隨即宣佈放棄金本位，俾可與美匣在國際市塲上相角逐。</p>
<p>Ｄ减低幣値與通貨膨脹：例如今年一月二十五日美國的新通貨政策。照這通貨政策所採取的辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）金元平價·减低（Develuation）四成至五成。</p>
<p>（二）金歸國有，不予流通，不予兌換。</p>
<p>（三）以平價减値所得剩餘金，設滙兌安定基金（Stabilization）二十億金元－原來。</p>
<p>美國的金元·每元重量爲二互·八克冷，現在减去百分之四○，九四○遂成爲一五·二三七克冷！</p>
<p>此項政策之目的，本在於提高物價，救濟債務人，藉以獎國內的生產復興，减少失業者和金融的恐慌。</p>
<p>Ｅ抬高銀價（一）一九三三年倫敦會議所產生之九國白銀恊定！一九三四年，四月一日，批准後生效！！規定產銀國收買白銀；限制存銀國即：印度，秘魯，西班牙等國之出售白銀；限制印度於一九三四年內平均只許售出白銀三千五百萬盎斯，四年之內，售銀總量不得超過一萬四千萬盎斯；限制中國四年之內，不許出售由鎔毀貨幣所得之生銀等等。</p>
<p>（二）美國的白銀國有政策，即一九三四年八月九日的購銀法案。（Silver　PurchaseActof　1934）規定：（一）以金及銀爲貨幣價値之基凖定爲金七五％。（三）上項之銀，得由國家收買之，其收買之價格，凡國內之銀，每盎斯定爲五角以內。（四）統制貨幣用銀之輸出抑或輸入，以及其他交易。（五）課以五％之銀交易利潤稅，（六）以銀爲凖備發行銀票。（SilverCertilicate）</p>
<p>上述一，二，這兩項事實，都是以抬高銀價，希望由此可以逹到提高用銀國的購買力爲目的。總觀上面五種辦法，C.D.E.三項，都是着重於貨幣制度的變革方面。法國經濟學家Francis　Delaisi和美國Pittmon均爲D.E.兩項的擁護者。法國Truchy和Millard均各就自己的立塲而反對之。如Truchy主張恢復金貨原有的功效；Millard則認爲貨幣减値與通貨膨脹時，對於勞働者大有損害等語。他們或則就本國的利益立論，或則依階級的利益立論，我們不必一一加以批判。現在我們暫且對於各國貨幣减値及招高銀價對於中國貨幣的關係怎樣？和諸位來談一談。</p>
<p>（三）抬高銀價對於中國貨幣的影響</p>
<p>（Ａ）先就一般經濟而言，</p>
<p>（一）銀價招高，中國的物價必低落，金本位國家，則金幣跌價，而物價高漲！！</p>
<p>（二）以中國貨幣爲標凖的滙兌行市高漲，以外國貨幣爲標凖的匯兌行市跌落。－即順匯高漲，逆滙跌落！！</p>
<p>（三）銀價提高，有利於外貨傾銷，不利於中國之輸出。</p>
<p>（四）銀價提高以後，不利於以金幣爲計算單位的國際收入，而有利於以金幣爲計算單位之支出；有利於以銀幣爲計算單位的收入，不利於以銀幣爲計算單位的支出，可是中國關稅收入，因銀價高漲，在關金計算上，必然因而减少；而華僑的匯欵，亦因銀價提高而更縮减。但是，銀價提高的好處，也是有的，例如償付外債，及使館，留學生等經費，當然也可以减少相當的銀幣數目。不過同入超的數量比較起來，這點利益，眞是微乎其微。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）再專就中國而言：</p>
<p>（一）中國爲銀本位國，且爲世界用銀國之首腦部，試舉一九二八年至一九三二年銀銷路平均百分數如下表，即可知中國對於白銀之關係。</p>
<p>銷路佔銀產量之百分數佔銀供給之百分數</p>
<p>中國四○％三○％</p>
<p>印度三二％二五％</p>
<p>工業二一％一五％</p>
<p>鑄幣三二％二五％</p>
<p>觀上表，則抬高銀價，對於中國的影響，確是非常重大，在原則上言之，銀價抬高，就是增加了中國貨幣對於外國貨幣的比價，似乎很有利益於中國的。實則大謬不然，其原因如下：</p>
<p>（二）國外銀價抬高之後，中國的存銀必向外流出，徽之過去三四個月內中國銀幣流出二萬萬元以上的事實，即可證明。銀貨流出，則中國的通貨凖備金不足，加以華僑滙欵之减少，國內必缺乏銀貨，行將變成紙幣世界，因而必發生金融恐慌。</p>
<p>（三）銀價提高，因匯兌關係，利於外國貨物之推銷，减低中國之輸出，入超必更甚。去年入超七億元以上，今年尙不知伊於　底。因此中國負債與日俱進，非更加低附於資本主義國家的經濟而生存不可，換言之，中國必更殖民地化。</p>
<p>（四）銀價提高之後，國內銅幣價格，即相對的將跌落，平民生活，愈受着嚴重的壓迫，不但呈現一般購買力的减低，且愈加促使農村經濟破產，形成不可收拾的局面。</p>
<p>（四）如何解除中國貨幣的危機？</p>
<p>基於上面所述的危機，國內人士都很關心這個貨幣恐慌問題。一般人提出的救濟辦法，大約可總括爲下列四點：</p>
<p>（Ａ）禁銀出口，此路在中國是走不通的，因有治外法權及外商銀行作投機者的庇護，官廰没有方法行使禁令的權限。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）行金本位，（例如廿末爾計劃），因爲中國缺乏金貨，也是行不通的。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）銀輸出徵稅，並附以平衡匯兌行市的方法。這兩項政策已由政府實行，在目前　辦法的時候，尙不失爲治標的辦法。</p>
<p>（Ｄ）改良貨幣制度</p>
<p>（一）减低紙幣發行的現金凖備爲四成，以期相對地膨脹通貨。</p>
<p>（二）改善銀本位制，使銀在國內成爲保證手段，在國外成爲流通手段，使中國貨幣與世界銀價脫離關係，其辦法在於停止兌現，而不禁止白銀輸出；其次則採用「輸入商人須呈騐貨向中央銀行如數購買白銀抵銷貨價」的辦法——</p>
<p>見周伯棣美國白銀政策的批判一文，載新中華二卷十七期——</p>
<p>這不過是一種理想吧了，即令能够實行也未見得就能够解除了我們的貨幣恐慌。</p>
<p>結論：中國的貨幣恐慌，即是中國經濟恐慌的具體表現。帝國主義可以用經濟政策來减輕其危機，中國則絶對不能以貨幣的政策來解除經濟恐慌的危機的。原因是：</p>
<p>中國農材的貨幣，流入都市。由都市流入大都市，再由大都市復流入外國，是一種繼續不已的現象。因爲中國的民族資本受制於帝國主義、產業不能發逹，以致没有相當的輸出，足以抵付這年復一年的高度以入超，所以在國際收支上，絶不能得到平衡，長此以往，定歸有一天民窮財盡，成爲一個没有金銀的國家。縱然外國以投資的方式，運輸金銀到中國來，那麽，這就無異於更進一步淪陷於殖民地的地位，永遠不能自拔。所以目前中國的問題，因銀價而引起的恐慌事小，因被資本主義的侵略的經濟恐慌事大。别的國家，可以用經濟政策來解决經濟恐慌；惟有中國，非先從政治鬥爭着手，不能逹到解除經濟恐慌的目的，政治鬥爭方法固多，在目前我們相信舉國應有下列一致的共同努力，即：</p>
<p>（一）完成統一的獨立的國家；</p>
<p>（二）組織健全强有力的政府；</p>
<p>（三）實行有計劃的經濟建設；</p>
<p>（四）實行對外貿易的統制政策。</p>
<h3>白銀增稅的效力與洋拆高漲</h3>
<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>白銀問題，現在差不多已成爲中國貨幣上的一種寒熱病。銀價的忽上忽落，大家都像瘧疫患者般地感到發燒發冷的苦痛。而今年四月以來的存銀，常期地大量流出，已使中國人都弄到像驚弓之鳥。可是增征白銀出口稅及平衡稅，並無像金雞納霜一般的效騐如神。最近因洋拆飛漲，同時報上又喧傳暗中仍有奸商在繼續運銀出口的消息。於是國人莫不談虎色變，惶惶然以爲洋拆飛漲的原因，就爲這個原故。洋拆飛漲，確與銀根奇緊有密切的關係；而過去白銀之大量出口，確也是造成今日銀根枯竭的一個主要原因，所以洋拆飛漲，即由於白銀之繼續出口所致，確也言之有理。但在目前，　　至少在這次洋拆飛漲的目前，這兩者之間，似乎並没有更多的聯擊關係。不過白銀之仍能逃出，倒底是增稅改策效力微弱的表現。而申地洋拆飛漲，則又另一個問題。天主另有其道理。似乎不必就拼爲一談。</p>
<p>當白銀增稅令頒佈不久，滬地現銀流出的潮水，確似停止過一時；同時向內移動的紀錄，確也一再出現於報端記載。於是大家欣欣然地以爲增稅改策，眞有金鷄納霜之功，咸以爲從此可使白銀告一段落，而內地的農村金融，亦從此得有解救倒懸的希望。其實白銀的內洩，得助於增稅政策之力者幾希。而增稅政策，在事實上所能做到的成績，誇大點說，只是在國際間暫時引起若干衝動，减輕了三個星期模樣的銀價激騰的空氣。如果老實一點說，那至多只使公開的裝運白銀出口，變爲秘密地或調弄槍花地裝運出口，同時又至多替國家稅收，另開了一重增益的門户。此外就再也得不到什麽？</p>
<p>誰都知道，增徵白銀出口稅及平衡稅的目的，是在防止國內存銀我流，是在避免國內金融基礎的澈底破產。其實，國內存銀的所有權，究屬有多少是屬於國人的？同時，國內金融基礎，在昨天是否確有充實的正貨在押　？楊蔭溥先生說得不錯，國內現銀之流入在華外行，與流出倫敦紐約，並無二致。而外行存銀之留於國內或移出國外，本質上也是一樣。而耿愛德以公正的態度，也承認過去白銀的大批流入中國，並不能看作中國銀底的增高，那只是大多數來作海上「寓私」罷了。而內地金融的奇緊，已十足地表示了中國金融基礎早已空虛了。由於這種觀點來看白銀增稅政策，有助於國內通貨問題者，原已微乎其微。</p>
<p>然而也有人說過，同時政府當局也曾這樣說過，白銀增稅與加正平衡稅的另一個主要目的，是在於使國內的銀價，與世界銀市宣告脫離關係而獨立。因此世界的銀市，儘讓他奔動，而我國內的銀價，總可希望他得以安定。國內銀價得以安定，商品物價，大可希望他不再崩跌。不再重苦農工商民。其實，歐美的學者，對於他們本國物價的慘跌，現在也都不再深信是全由於通貨數量變動的關係。何况根本無力自主物價市塲的我國；此種希望，至多只能看做一種虔敬的迷信而已。</p>
<p>事實是非常明顯，這次國內一般物價－尤其中糧食物價的昇騰，主要的理由，便受今年全世界遍遭災荒之賜。而軍需工業的發逹，也是其中主要的作用之一。所以在增收銀稅之前，國內外物價市塲，早呈此種趨勢。而增稅之後，又確逢秋收成績的减少，表現於事實之際。由於一般人心對於糧食恐慌的憂慮，同時白銀增稅在心理上又不無引起一時緊張的局面。因此，交易所方面的投機份子，因勢利導，造成了最近農產物價市塲罕有的活躍，而這種活躍的結果，才與此次洋拆的沸騰發生眞正的聯繫，白銀之「停止」外流而開始內洩，與此也有一脈相連的關係。</p>
<p>問題需略加分析，才能揭開此中因果。</p>
<p>近年國內農村破產，現金集中都市。同時外貨侵銷，物價每况愈下。農民因急於籌欵過活與還債，不得不硬着肚腸，賤價出賣其農產。農產物價市塲，乃益蹶不振。都市的銀行家，則正苦於投資無路，乃在救濟農村的名義之下，實行向農村作資金的活動。爲了他們要保障其本利妥收無誤，所以專力於農產之抵押放欵，不少數量的農產，便流進新設的大批農產倉庫裏去。但是舶來農產物的壓勢迄未稍衰，所以國內農產市塲，依然死氣沉沉。徼天之幸，旱魃降世；各地歉收，恐慌驟起。跌落已久之農產物價，乃開始回昇。同時糧食商人，又大顯身手。利用農民需欵孔亟之心，在價格略漲之中，即行大量進貨。我信今日全國四百萬萬石存倉米穀之中，至少有四分之三以上是屬於田主和商人。田主和商人的手頭較寬，不必急於變賣；同時又因荒象早成，大家都對未來的（實即就是明春青黃不接之際）米穀物價，必將暴騰；故皆怡怡待免。上海米市的來貨旣稀，市價當然再漲；而正因內地來貨稀少，資金流動亦緩。近日的洋拆激降，就是這種道理，洋拆市面，本隨商業往來之興衰而定。近年百業凋敝，產業蕭條，復加內地農產，已有倉庫駐足；不必立刻踴至都市。因此都市對內地的商業清淡，資金流動遲鈍；乃造成了本年以來洋拆空前低落的紀錄。可是此次秋收成績，見諸於激减的成績。因此上海米價及雜糧市面，照例在秋收之際，勢必在奸商的殺價之下，將大跌特跌；而今日則因上述之故，依然維持其漲勢。此種情形，一方使內地田主和商人，有出賣之存倉積貨，而另行換進新米；在一轉折間，旣可以先調眼前高價之利，又仍可保持其明春居奇扳價的希望。同時連年爲穀所　毁的農民，鑒於今日市面的活躍，也已心滿意足，將其新收之貨，即行向都市運銷。而都市的米商，舉目高矚，　一穀田主和商人抱着同樣的希望，咸請値此秋收登塲時的米價尙且堅挺，何况到明春青黃不接，例皆騰貴之時？勢必較今日更大得多。則何不儘先多多吸收現貨，以待財神之降臨。各有其心，各有其志，於是都市與內地的商業關係，驟然頻繁。資金流動，亦頓然亢進。近日票據交換數額之增加，即此明證。旣有此例外的事態發生，况此刻上海本當金融繁忙季節之中。往年今日，上海現金，也以內地農產登塲而有大量移出的習慣。綜此數因，於是上海拆市，大有起色。據昨日市面（本月二十日），已漲至二角二分之高度。爲昨年稀有之紀錄。但畢竟因爲荒歉，來貨仍不及往年之鉅，所以商業頻繁的程度，與資金移動的數量，究屬難及往年之高。因此洋拆的緊張，只能與今昨兩年中比較，才可顯出其躍進的氣燄。若與二十的比較，那還差得很遠。今日惶惶然的恐怖，實不應在此而應在别的問題，試先看近四年來的上海拆市之變動可知。</p>
<p>上海的拆市，在民國二十年度最高的紀錄，便在十月份。那時曾開過六錢的市價。到了二十一年度，頂盤的時間是二月，那時市價曾逹七錢之鉅。但其後即崩跌；至十月以後，可憐見地已在五六分的低度。到了去年以來，平時尙在最高的一角與最低的白借中廻旋。直到十一月開出了一角八分的紀錄；至十二月又增了二分而爲二角。可是一入本年，便又老毛病重發，至八月以後，始見回昇；開過一角五分的高價。九月裏開過一角六分的頂盤。但十月初，又回小，至爲一角四分；這一角四分的市面，已算本月中最高的數字。在中旬以下，已常在六分上停着。到了本月份初，重又回漲至一角與一角二分。直到十五日以後，才由一角三分漲一角五分至一角八分；至十九日而漲至二角一分；至二十日而一躍爲二角二分。並據傳暗盤旦有做三四角者。但也據傳暗盤雖有三四角，但大家還少於嘗試。這種情形，似乎確與存底枯竭有關。然而存底的枯竭，只是現銀繼續流出的結果；而洋拆的飛騰，却並不能看作是全由存底枯竭的結果。不過我並不是說兩者間就毫無關係。我只是說，此次洋拆飛漲的主要動力，是在於一般投機商人，向農村加緊榨取的結果。否則當存銀大量流出的八九十月間，何以拆市遠不如今日之巨呢？（未完）</p>

<h3>湯山衛生設施實况（上）</h3>
<p>— 鄧立誠</p>
<p>醫學乃科學之結晶，隨着科學之演進，與社會之進化，日新月異，而漸臻精緻，故其對象，不僅爲片面的病案，整個社會之健康，實爲其目的。衛生事業發逹之今日，亦卽醫學之由消極的疾病治療，而趨向於積極的預防，與整個民族之文明與富强以及社會之健全，有莫大之關係。年來我國衛生事業正在萌芽，民間醫藥衛生設施，尤爲需要。茲特將鄙人上月在湯山實地調查該處鄉村衛生實况，彙述於次，以償同道中關心於我國衛生事業者。</p>
<p>湯山爲江寗縣之屬鎭，在南京中山門外有六十里之遙，當京杭國道要衝。地有溫泉，因以著名。交通便利，風景絶佳，爲首都名勝區域之一。有居民兩萬餘人，散居於五十餘村。鎭內向無醫藥設備，更以人民缺少衛生知識，每當疾病流行之時，目無所措。衛生署有鑒於此，爲普及民衆醫藥，實施鄉村衛生起見，特於民國二十年冬在該鎭設立衛生事務所。更爲實施便利計，劃該鎭十六村爲鄉村衛生實騐區，俾以漸次推廣。衛生事務所成立之初，其時僅就門診工作。然不數月間，病人擁擠，工作繁忙，爲擴充起見，乃於次年二月間在鎭之西，建築平房四進，佔地四畝有餘，七月竣工，遷入新址，擴充門診，並增加下列各項衛生工作。（學校衞生，婦嬰衛生，環境衛生，疾病預防，衛生宣傳，生命統計。茲將該所之組織，設備，與人員以及工作之槪况分述於次：</p>
<p>（一）組織：衛生事務所直隸於衛生署及全國經濟委員會衛生實騐處。本年春江寗自治實騐縣加入合作，故又爲江寗自治實騐縣湯山衛生所。然經費則由衛生署供給。</p>
<p>（二）人員：主任醫師一人，掌理醫務與設計各項衛生工作及其他行政事宜。助產士一人，任助產及產前產後家庭訪親等婦嬰衛生工作。公共衛生護士三人，辦理門診病人，巡廻醫療，　學校衛生護士工作。此外助理人員二人。男女工役三人。</p>
<p>（三）設備：（一）診病室</p>
<p>（二）藥局</p>
<p>（三）換藥室</p>
<p>（四）門診候診室</p>
<p>（五）小手術室門診產前檢查與其他小手術之用。</p>
<p>（六）辦公室於門診時間以外，醫師護士，助產士辦公之用。</p>
<p>（七）陳列室陳列各項衛生標本，婦嬰衛生掛圖，及衛生習慣掛圖，兒童衛生玩具等，專供民衆參觀，及母親會，兒童會會塲。</p>
<p>（四）工作槪况：</p>
<p>「甲」疾病治療：</p>
<p>Ａ門診上午八時至十二時爲門診時間，不論睛雨，每日門診病人有五十至六十之多，以胃腸病，沙眼，急性眼結膜炎，皮膚病，小外科及瘧疾爲最多。初診祇收掛號費銅元十枚，復診銅元五枚。其他藥品及外科材料等，一槪不收費。此外在今年二月間，該鎭之石地村，曾發生流行性腦膜炎，一時感染者，有六十餘人之多。該所另闢臨時病室，以資收容，當時受治療而得全愈者，有五十餘人。治療之方法，亦用腦膜炎血清注射於脊髓管內。</p>
<p>Ｂ巡廻醫療除門診疾病治療外，在每日下午由公共衛生護士一人負責至距鎭較遠之村莊巡廻醫療。所治疾病，祇限於皮膚病，沙眼，瘧疾及外科換藥等，所帶藥品，多係日常普通應用之幾種。如遇重症患者，當卽時送衛生所治療。鄙人曾實地隨該所護士參觀巡廻醫療工作，覺得頗爲需要而有價値。因爲一般農民多因農事繁忙，往往因輕微症病而不願來衛生所診治，因而攖成重症者，殊不少見。巡廻醫療，應農民之需要而獲得衛生工作上之最大效果。</p>
<h3>所謂口腔傳染中牙與眼之病理關係</h3>
<p>— 陳任</p>
<p>什麽是口腔傳染？口腔傳染是由英文”Fornl　infection“而來。這個名字來自美國，因爲近年來對病理上原因之研究，發現了許多全身的病，其原因在身體局部的病態，如口腔內的牙部，偏桃腺或鼻之副腔。在這裏局部所發生的慢性膿炎等，不呈重大的局部病象，所以大家都不去注意他。但是這裏是毒菌的製造所，從這裏毒菌分布到全身，或身體的别部，而形成全身病，如毒血，敗血病，或身體别部的病，如腎，臟炎，眼內炎等。美國的醫生們，對這些由口腔之牙，偏桃腺或鼻副腔所引起的傳染，總稱之曰Fornl　infection，我們譯牠爲口腔傳染，範圍似覺太狹，其中尙包含鼻副腔在內的。</p>
<p>我們眼睛有許多的內眼病，如虹膜睫狀體炎，如脈絡膜炎，乳頭炎，金眼炎等等，多由轉移性而來。其轉移的來源，鼻之副腔及口之扁桃腺都占重要地位，是醫生們都知道的。近年來自發見了齒牙傳染（Dentrogcne　Fokalinpektioir）之後，於是眼科醫生們對轉移性的內眼病的原因，也注意到牙齒去了。同時也就發見了齒牙與眼之密切的病理關係，照最近的統計，特别是虹膜睫狀體炎，由齒牙的傳染，亦占百分之一·二。</p>
<p>如時髦是我們人類的天性，在科學界裏亦常有這種現象，譬如每一種新的理論出來，常過分的宣傳，自內眼病的原因由齒牙傳梁的道理論宣佈後，也大受　般學者的重視，觀察之。我們並不否認齒牙傳染的理論，而且我們承認齒牙傳染有極大的可能性，因爲許多轉移性的眼病，旣可由别處如鼻副腔等處轉移而來，爲什麽不能由齒牙傳染呢。然而一種理論的成立，不能但依他的可能性，而必須有牠的必然性。我們不能說齒牙傳染是可能的，我們必得證實齒牙傳染確有這樣的事實，這事實的證實，就是這必然性的證明，也就是這理論成立的根據。在求必然性的證實，同時還要注意何種齒病爲齒牙傳染之原因，並其地位與眼病之關係，然後才能由必然性的理論，而得一正確的統計數。茲本此原則，而考充齒牙傳染的理論。</p>
<p>（二）欲證明醫學理論的必然必性，必須二種事實（一）臨床的經騐，（二）動物的實騐，對齒牙傳染的理論，至今未有動物的實騐，因尙無實騐的方法，自然也無由實騐。齒牙傳染的理論，完全根據於臨床的經騐。現在我們且先究臨床的事實。譬如我們發現了內眼病，我們當致全力於原因的探究。全身的檢查，考騐室的檢查，我們没有發現什麽病態。當我們檢查他們的口腔時，發見他的齒牙是不健全的。這二件偶然的，平列的事實，我們就可承認他垂的因果關係了嗎？不能！决不能的！就是這偶然數增加，倘若我們在每個內眼病者，都發見他們齒牙是不健全的；這時候我們還是不能承認他們的絶對因果的關係。因爲照齒科近世的報告，牙齒病可說是文明病，都市中差不多個個人都有的。可是這些齒牙病者，却没有個個人發生齒牙傳染的病象。在大齒科醫院裏，每年不知有千百的齒患者，及各式的齒病者，但未見眼病發生，我們更進一步，對內眼病者之及齒牙患者，請牙醫生們將病治愈。倘若內眼病亦因之而愈時，那末這齒牙傳染的必然性，似乎可以證實了罷！確實近代齒牙傳染的理論有統計，全根據在這個原則上。不過我們對這「治愈」的槪念，必須有相當的確定。許多的內眼病，特别是虹膜炎常易重發，而且他的痊愈，有時起於忽然地，意料之外的。又其是患牙的㧞去，因傷口之出血，及蛋白之分解，而引起一種刺激性的治療法，常使病象起痊愈的變化。那末這種牙病的醫治，及眼病的痊愈，全屬一種偶然的，或非專門的因果關係，所以我們對續發性的內眼病者，由齒牙病治愈後而愈者，必須有一二年以上之觀察，觀其再會重發否？倘若仍不免重發，那末原未去，根未斷，這牙病治愈與內眼病之痊愈，全屬偶然，而非齒牙的傳染。反之牙患去後；因旣除，根自斷，則就無重發的現象，齒牙傳染的必然性就可確實了。</p>
<p>由這樣確切的臨床報告的總歸納，才能獲得一正確的統計數目。可是審查近代齒牙傳染的總統報告上，對眠病痊愈的一點，是否有一年以上的觀察，其統計上的病者，是否全無重發之現象，都未注意及詳載。</p>
<p>（二）怎樣的齒牙病，或何處的牙患能引起齒牙傳染的現象？研究者都不遺餘力。齒牙傳染的路，不外由血管或神經的轉移。所以齒牙的外病，其與血管及神經不生直接接觸關係的，根本無轉移的可能性。</p>

<p>反之一切慢性的齒根炎，如肉芽腫，或囊腫等，與血管神經有密切的關係者，實爲齒牙傳染的總關鍵。這些齒根炎的發見，必須用Ｘ光綫的透照。所以內眼病之有齒牙傳染之懷疑得，Ｘ光綫的透照，是檢查上决不少的。至於齒糟膿漏，因其膿有出口，其轉移的可能性，自然减少，故一般學者都不承認其有齒牙傳染性。簡單的齲牙，還没有傷及齒髓者，亦無傳染之可能性。若齲牙已及齒髓，於是直接與血管神經接觸，那没才有齒牙傳染之可能性。</p>
<p>齒病與齒牙傳染，旣有如此之關係，所以於統計的報告上，更當注意。至今一切的統計報告上，對怎樣的齒病，都未有記錄。所謂齒病是專指有齒牙傳染可能性的齒病呢？抑一切的齒病？都未能確知，故其統計數目，亦未能有科學的確實性。</p>
<p>牙病的地位與內眼病之齒牙傳染，亦有價値。上顎的齒病與眼病的關係，是否比下顎的齒病爲密切？左邊的齒病是否僅與左眼發生傳染的關係？這些問題，至今尙無注意者，所以在統計數上，更無詳細的紀載。</p>
<p>這兩個步驟，都未有確實的解决，那末齒牙傳染的理論，至今還是可能性的，而非必然性的理論。因之他的統計數，自然尙欠確切。還須要合集無數的眼科，內科及牙科醫生們，共同負責，共同研究。共同收集材料。在無數正確的，詳細的，科學的材料中，就是臨床的經騐中，才能造成齒牙傳染正確的基礎，及眞正的統計數目。</p>
<p>共同研究旣有了共同的目標，更須有共同的方法。敬提研究的約法三章，請其注意焉：</p>
<p>（一）每內眼病者，必求詳細的全身檢查，用Ｘ光綫透照肺部，極爲重要。同時必有齒牙的檢查，並用Ｘ光綫，亦爲必要。</p>
<p>（二）牙醫生遇有慢性齒根炎，及其他牙患之有齒牙傳染可能性者，當問其有否眼病，或其他內病。最好請各專家詳細檢查。</p>
<p>（三）發表的記錄，必求詳細。特别是齒牙上的記載，如牙病的地位，上下左右之分，何齒何病，及治療之方法，愈詳愈好，以爲理論證實上正確有考據。</p>
<p>此文之作得好友顧海陵博士（兒童齒科院醫務主任）之切磋者不少。當我初稿開始時，博士適病。以博士身體之健，固不以爲意。誰料一病不起，竟於十一月十一日長逝。痛我之失知友，更痛正在建設中，新醫學界之失棟才。急完此文，敬獻於博士亡靈之前，而默祝其爲新醫服務之精神不死！</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（四十七）腸癌</p>
<p>（問）腸內的癌腫，是不是和其他部分的癌腫一樣，老年人患的最多？</p>
<p>（答）是的。大槪四十歲以上的男子，比較最多。</p>
<p>（問）腸癌，發生在那一部分的腸內呢？</p>
<p>（答）發生在直腸內的最多；大腸和小腸內較少。</p>
<p>（問）患直腸癌，到什麽時候纔起病狀？</p>
<p>（答）起初發生時，並没有什麽症狀；到了二三年之後纔起病狀。然在少年而有特異質的，却很迅速進行。</p>
<p>（問）患直腸癌的病人，自己覺得怎樣不舒服？</p>
<p>（答）起初常常排出黏液的大便；其中混少量的血液；後來起泄瀉，並且有裏急後重。薦骨却有壓迫，或腹部膨滿。</p>
<p>（問）如果患了直腸癌而起潰瘍時，有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）這是因爲糞便的摩擦而起黏膜的潰瘍。這時候黏液增加，伴有血液，便意頻繁。</p>
<p>（問）直腸有没有變狹窄呢？起什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）凡癌腫硬化，往往使直腸變爲狹窄。這時候起頑固的便秘糞塊成顆粒像兎糞的樣子。薦骨部有壓迫感，腹部有膨滿感，並有鈍痛。有時起腸壅塞症狀，或者泄瀉和便秘交互起來的。</p>
<p>（問）起了潰瘍或狹窄症狀後，有没有危險？</p>
<p>（答）病人急劇的起衰弱，或有慢性敗血症狀。</p>
<p>（問）膀胱和腹腔，受有什麽影響？</p>
<p>（答）直腸癌可以穿孔到這些部分而起大出血。非常危險。</p>
<p>（問）大腸癌，大槪發生在那一段？</p>
<p>（答）大都發生於大腸的最下段乙字狀部。其次在大腸的初段肓腸內。</p>
<p>（問）生了大腸癌，自己覺得患部的疼痛嗎？</p>
<p>（答）在初期差不多完全不覺怎樣，等到起了狹窄，因爲上部的腸管蠕動亢進，於是起持續的疝痛。</p>
<p>（問）生了大腸癌後，大便情形怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）大都便秘，尤其如大腸下部起了狹窄，就現兎糞或絞紐狀糞。腸癌若在上部，有交互起泄瀉和便秘的。</p>
<p>（問）病人起嘔吐嗎？</p>
<p>（答）狹窄若在上部，遲早現腸內容的停留。起急性腸壅塞而致肚出糞便。</p>
<p>（問）小腸癌，發生於腸的那一部分？</p>
<p>（答）以十二時指腸內爲最多。但小腸癌本身，實占腸癌中的最少數。這時候有因爲腫瘍的壓迫而起黃疸或糖尿的。若在空腸內，就起狹窄症狀，有嘔吐。</p>
<p>（問）腸癌的治療方法是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）除了早期行外科切除手術外，絶無他法。銧放射療法，也不過一種安慰的治療，没有什麽大效。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（二十七）實扶的里（俗稱白喉）</p>
<p>（二）喉頭實扶的里Kehlkopfdjphtherie</p>
<p>喉頭實扶的里又名喉頭格魯布Kehlkopfkronp。大都續發於咽頭實扶的里。爲三種實扶的里當中最重篤而多危險的一種。在二歲至七歲的小兒。患這種實扶的里最多。他的主在症候。就是發生急性喉頭狹窄。屢遭生命的危險。這是因爲患喉頭實扶的里的時候。在聲帶的表面。被覆纖維素性沈着物（義膜）。以致呼吸空氣的出入門（聲門）。發生狹窄。喉頭一旦狹窄。那就發生呼吸困難。呼吸困難如逹高度。卽易發生窒息。而陷入危險的狀態。（若用俗語來形容這種危險，就是閉氣）。我現在再將喉頭狹窄發生的經過和他的結果。略爲一說。讀者諸公。或可更覺明瞭啊。</p>
<p>喉頭狹窄發生的起初。卽覺聲音嘶啞。發生格魯布咳嗽。這種咳嗽是一種刺戟性咳嗽。聲若犬吠。有經騐的醫師。若聞此聲。卽可推測。斷爲本病。狹窄的程度如再增進。則呈呼吸困難的現象。此時咽頭大都亦潮紅腫脹。但是義膜不必一定察見。下顎骨的下方和後方的淋巴腺。發生壓痛性的腫脹。若用喉頭鏡檢查喉頭。則見灰白色的義膜。附着在聲帶和他的周圍。該部腫脹著明。所以空氣的流通。當然發生阻碍。體溫雖多上昇。但不必然。狠少超過攝氏三十九度。脈搏著明細小頻數。屢帶不整。此際若早得確實的診斷。施以適當的處置。大都經過數日。就可治愈。否則錯過治療的良機。各種症候次第進行。空氣通過聲門。更形障碍。格魯布咳嗽亦更劇烈。呼吸困難亦隨逹極度。血液內的炭酸增加。而酸素則反缺少。所以口唇。舌。頰。耳翼。手指等處的皮膚。失却健康皮膚的紅潤。變爲鉛灰色。或呈紫色。患者的顏貌。現出痛苦狀的表情。舉動不安。轉輾牀上。心臟亦著明衰弱。終以無救窒息而死。再格魯布的發和。多在夜間。突然驚破睡眠。發生呼吸困難。頓陷窒息狀態。這是因爲睡眠的時候。增生格魯布性義膜。以致被覆聲門引起格魯布的緣故。有時且因粘液的聚積。或兩側聲帶的邊緣。互相粘着的時候。亦可引起格魯布的發作。但患兒往往可由喀出纖維素性義膜。而消散這種的發作。這無非喀出後。聲門偶然得到一種流通空氣的機會罷了。</p>
<p>我們照上面講的經過看起來。喉頭實扶的里的持續。往往祗有一日到三日。間有在一星期左右。至於長久的持續。那就屬於例外的了。他的死亡原因。大都屬於由喉頭狹窄引起窒息的結果。這已經是狠明白的事實。當可毋庸再述</p>
<p>喉頭實扶的里的併發症。當以氣營枝炎和氣管枝肺炎的兩種爲最多。</p>
<h3>發熱普通治療法（十一）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>病後若是身體溫度常比健康時溫度低，例如，體溫九十七度（或攝度表三十七度）回復原來工作也當遲緩。再假如病後少一動作心跳就很快，也是一種需要較長休養的表顯。應當再繼續休養直到健全爲止</p>
<p>病漸愈到了可以起床的時候，當漸漸的起來，不可驟然起床行走。若發過的熱越厲害，病的時間越長久，起床也當格外慢慢的行。長期重病後若是兩腿無力，第一步可在臥床時漸漸活動兩腿。法卽在床脚頭放枕頭，先以兩脚蹬枕頭以爲運動。漸漸實行到起床時腿就可以有力。病人長久靜臥一旦要起床是不可以的。第一步坐起在床他的背要靠住東西。起初這樣坐床要時間很短一日一兩次就够了，漸次回數加多時間加長，祇要病人不覺得疲乏便可。再進一步就可帮助他坐在椅上，每次頂長五分鐘。早晚各一次够了。這樣坐起來每日時間可以加長一倍。如此行數日後就可以帮助他走動。當病後漸漸行動時，務要預防病人暈倒。暈倒最容易時，就是他快快起來自己大小便時。病後回到過冷過熱的地方當慢慢行。經濟方便的病後休假數星期或數月也是很値得的。</p>
<p>飲食病　漸全愈病人的胃口也日有起色注意此時不要呌他吃太多或吃不容易消化的食物。不可以他的胃口爲標準，應當以他的身體强弱爲標準。故病初愈切戒急赴筵席大餐，就是家常健康人所吃的食物也不可以吃，應當吃特别容易消化的。普通最大的弊病卽病後給他所不能消化的食物，或給他太多過於他的消化能力。病後由食物不合宜生不消化病就要阻碍他快恢復健康。</p>
<p>滋補品　病後病人的身體當然是精疲力竭貧血瘦弱。鐵質補血藥品如卜老氏，檸酸酸錏鐵，砒類，士的年類等等，配服合宜，加上合宜滋養飲食，注意實個人衛生，多得新鮮空氣太陽光，恢復健康可以立待。</p>
<p>治療法實用</p>
<p>前已詳述發熱的各種治療法。方法雖是有了，但各種發熱狀况不同，治療也必須各得其宜。茲舉發熱病之最著者提出普通治療綱要以供病家參考。</p>
<p>（一）傷寒病　傷寒病爲發熱病中最兇最烈的。我國每年死於此病的不下數十百萬。正式的傷寒病發熱很商的時期約四星期之久，發熱共歷一個半月有餘。治療不得當實在是危險不可言狀。治療不得當十個患病當中至少要有三個死亡。就是用最新的方法治療也免不了百分之十要死亡。這實在是一種可怕的病症。現在還没有什麽方法立時可治全愈傷寒病，不過治療可以减去很多的危險。治療的責任一部分是醫生的，一部分是病家的。病家的責任卽實行醫生所指示的治療方法。務注意不要傷寒病傳染他人。務實行醫生所指示的預防傳染方法。茲略述幾種傷寒病的重要治療法於下</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（三十二）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第八章　臨床檢查法</p>
<p>Ｃ結核菌的檢查　這是在痰的檢查中最重要的一種工作。就是在肺結核症全部診斷裏面，也没有比結核菌的發現再準確而重要的了－關於他的形狀和大小，在前面第一章裏面已經說過了，此處當然可以省去的。他在本症患者的痰中，爲數是狠多的，在膿狀痰裏面尤多；這是在取痰檢查時應特殊留意的。在檢查中的時候，須經過一種染色手續，方可和痰中其他的種種涇渭分明」的；不像彈力纖維和肺二口虫等，祇須置在顯微鏡下，就可認識出來的。尋常染色的結果，結核菌是現紅色，標本中其他均爲藍色，這當然是很容易鑑别的。結核菌如果在標本中發現了，關於他的數量多少，最好再作進一步研索，尋常分爲極少，少數，多數，極多數，四種等級；這當然已可明其大槪了！比較最精確的，以一標本中之多少，分爲十級：最少者在全標本祗有一菌至四菌，漸進至數視野僅有一菌，以及一視野中有一菌，再進而爲一視野有數菌，以至極我數爲止。這當然須將標本完全看過方行的。結核菌在痰中數月愈多，症勢自較數月少者爲重篤，豫後亦較凶險；但並不是必然的，有時也現例外的</p>
<p>有許多患本症的人們，痰裏面並没有結核菌的，這就是前面所講過閉鎖必本症了－就是含有結核菌的痰，有時因取痰不當的原因，或且是染色手續有點忽略了，都可以使結果大失其望的。所以他的有無確定，非反覆檢查數次不行的；至於僅憑一次未見，而卽貿然斷爲非本症，那更加是偏斷不明了貽笑方家</p>

<h3>「百無一用是書生」</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>常州詩人黃仲則有兩句發牢騷的詩：「十有九人堪白眼，百無一用是書生。」後一句也許於牢騷中帶點謙虛的味兒，不過書生無用是眞的。漢宣帝用文法吏，太子（元帝）說持刑太重，應該用儒生。宣帝不悅，說：「漢家自有制度，本以覇王道雜之，奈何純任德敎，有周政乎？且俗儒不逹時宜，好是古非今，使人眩於名實，不知所守，何足委任？」據說漢代帝王是尊儒術的，你看，他們眼裏的書生是怎樣一種不中用的東西！</p>
<p>同時在别一種社羣裏，也是看不起書生的。水滸七十一回，於梁山泊從新置立旌旗，分派職務以後，有一叚話說梁山泊好處：</p>
<p>「八方共城域，異姓一家。天地顯罡煞之精，人境合傑靈之美。千里面朝夕相見，一寸心死生可同。相貌語言，南北東西雖各别；心情肝胆，忠誠信義並無差。其人則有帝子神孫，富豪將吏，并三敎九流，乃至獵户漁人，屠兒劊子，都一般兒哥弟稱呼，不分貴賤；且又有同胞手足，捉對夫妻，與叔姪郎舅，以及跟隨主僕，爭鬥寃讐，皆一樣的酒筵歡樂，無問親疎。或精靈，或粗鹵，或村樸，或風流，何嘗相碍，果然識性同居；或筆舌，或刀槍，或奔馳，或偸騙，各有偏長，眞是隨才器使。可恨的是假文墨，没奈何着一個「聖手書生」，聊存風雅；最惱的是大頭巾，幸喜得先殺郤「白衣秀士」，洗盡酸慳。地方四五百里，英雄百零八人；昔時常說江湖上聞名，似古樓鐘聲聲轉播；；今日始知星辰中列姓，如念珠子個個連牽。在晁蓋恐托胆稱王，歸天及早；惟宋江肯呼羣保義，把寨爲頭。休言嘯聚山林，早願瞻依廊廟」。</p>
<p>——百二十回本七十一回頁五十七，水滸傳作者這樣和書生過意不去，竟說：『可恨的是假文墨，没奈何着一個「聖手書生」，聊存風雅；最惱的是大頭巾，幸喜得先殺郤「白衣秀士」，洗盡酸慳』。初看也頗忿然於懷；但轉念一想，也是眞話；江湖上好漢，綠林裏豪俠，有誰把書生放在眼裏呢！</p>
<p>因此又把吳敬梓的儒林外史捧起來，細看一遍；那是一部寫書生末落最眞切的書。我們把儒林外史和水滸串起來看，這兩個世界竟有這樣不可逾越的墻壁！諸如儒林外史裏的潘三爺，本不是什麽可愛可敬的人物；但以之與匡超人相比，便覺得十分偉大了。當匡超人流落他鄉窮無所歸的時候，潘三替他在包攬詞訟，拐賣婦女，頂替考試那些花樣裏着實撈得一點油水，還替他完了婚事。等到匡超人考取了敎習，在李給諫府裏做了甥婿；潘三在監裏希望他帮一帮忙；匡超人却扳着臉說，『······本該竟到監裏去看他一看，只是小弟而今比不得做諸生的時候；旣替朝廷辦事，就要依着朝廷的賞罰；若到這樣地方去看人，便是賞罰不明了。······潘三哥所做的這些事，便是我做地方官，我也是要訪拿他的；如今倒反走進監去看他，難道說朝廷處分他的不是？這就不是做臣子的道理了』。我們看了匡超人的腐話，眞使人頭痛。儒林外史最悽婉的莫如修補樂器的倪老爺，養了六個兒子，死了一個，賣了四個，連最小的一個都準備出賣。他對着戲子鮑文卿訴苦道············辰光，告訴不得你！我從二十歲上進學，到而今做了三十七年的秀才。就壞在讀了這幾句死書，拿不得輕，負不得重；一日窮似一日，兒女又多，只得借這手藝糊口，原是没奈何的事。——不瞞你說，我是六個兒子，死了一個，而今只得第六個小兒子在家裏；那四個兒子，都因没有的吃用。把他們賣在他州外府去了！······這一個小的，將來也留不住，也要賣與人去！』這樣瘦弱的人生，唯有這種不中用的東西才做得出來。俄國有一個青年女子，讀了柴霍甫的小說，不禁痛哭起來。她說：難道在俄國竟都是這類灰暗的人生瘦弱的靈魂嗎？儒林外史裏的角色，也使我們作此感想。吳敬梓在儒林外史收尾上提了四個理想人物：一個會寫字的，一個賣火紙筒子的，一個開茶館的，一個做裁縫的；尤以做裁縫的爲最完美。他借荆元的口，說出他的理想主張：</p>
<p>『我也不是要做雅人，也只爲性情相近，故此時常學學。至於我們這個賤行，是祖父遺留下來的，難道讀書識字，做了裁縫就沾污了不成？况且那些學校中的朋友，他們另有一番見識，怎肯和我們相與？而今每日尋得六七分銀子，吃飽了飯，要彈琴，要寫字，諸事都由得我；又不貪圖人的富貴，又不伺候人的顏色，天不收，地不管，倒不快活？』</p>
<p>可是這樣理想人物，仍是遯世的脆弱的，只配抹了花臉演喜劇的。在梁山　上，至多不過「没奈何」，「聊存風雅」而已。</p>
<p>屢格涅夫名著羅亭裏，羅亭撇了娜泰芽，留下了一封自責的書信，說：「我的天分似乎並不過薄，不過我的能力不足，所以不論什麽都不能成就。卽有天賦，毫無用處，卽使下了　子，不是一定都有結果。在我，没有能力使人們感動，尤其是没有能力使女人注意。祇靠一點知慧，是毫無益處的。很想熱心地挺身做事，但是事實上絲毫不能實現；我的運命，眞是可憐可笑！」嗚乎：「百無一用是書生！」</p>

<h3>味拉</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>在平列着的一行古舊的木屋子後面，一長排的高聳的椰樹底蔭影蓋罩下來，使屋子裏即在白天也異常陰暗。前面是平躺着的一條泥土馬路。在旱天，灰塵不住地飄揚起來；而在雨天，泥濘把人的脚步都給吸住。</p>
<p>味拉，這原始式的村市，後面遠連着味拉野林區域，前面橫躺着味拉河口。在赤道的黑夜世界，狂風挾着暴雨，不住地在屋後的森林間震撼，使野禽和野獸都哀鳴和狂嘷，而木屋子像地震般搖動起來。在炎炎太陽底下的晝間，味拉河口却不住地漲落着潮汐，河流滾滾地響着潮聲。偶然有一兩只小汽船從河中穿過，馬逹聲響上河岸，或者對岸班哖埠傳來了火輪開停的訊息，其餘的時間味拉便靜靜地躺在村野的沈默底氣息裏。</p>
<p>在這單調的泥土路上，中國人坐在小小的舖子裏半打瞌睡地做着生意，馬來人在賭錢和談天，孩子們在做異國的遊戲，而工人們却鎭日價披晒着「椰乾」。</p>
<p>馬路前面，近着河岸地方，是一片泥土的廣埕。支那人用着竹篾編成的東西，把椰子從馬來人手里買來，去殻取肉，把椰子果肉在這此地上面一片片披起來，預備晒成「椰乾」。日子一好，早晨的廣埕上便蹲下了中國工人，怪有耐性地把椰肉在一兩點鐘內披起來。在烈日之下，潮水漲時，河岸上却響起中國人和馬來土人的計算椰子的數字音響，斧頭碰椰子上，椰殻一破裂，一陣硬物的碎裂的音響便在空中振盪。</p>
<p>工人們靜靜地流着汗在一片樹葉下工作。</p>
<p>「媽的！」工人用着犀利的挖子挖起果殻里的果肉，如果一個不留心，挖子碰在手上，一小片肉和一堆血便跟着從手里流跌下來，於是便來了這個駡聲。</p>
<p>然而駡聲過後，把布裹在手上，挖子又給拿起來工作了。</p>
<p>最該詛咒的是落雨天。那時天上一陣黑雲飛過，廣埕上的工人便動亂起來，忙着收拾工作物。「阿答」葉剛椰肉上蓋住，身子已被淋得像剛從河里撈起來。一直等到椰肉晒成「乾」一包包被荷蘭皇家輪船公司載走了，工作才算有了收穫，然而同時别的工作品却又成堆積起來。－中國人是永遠這樣地博取薄利的。</p>
<p>然而味拉却在「椰乾」的跌價里窒悶了。老板們在搖頭嘆氣，工人們却在失業的狂潮里，在警察們的木棍下打着包裹回國。打金店子的廣州匠人已收起了店前的紅紙寫就的神位和香爐，而我的和和亮便失學起來，跟着打金的爸爸遷徙。味拉空鎖着成行的店子，鼠羣乘機在屋里繁殖和喧鬧。</p>
<p>遠在四十年前，味拉是味拉酋長的「王府」所在地，也是輪船的碇泊處。一到橡皮漲價，盛產橡皮的班哖流域的河口班哖埠便被建立起來，於是輪船易了抛錨處，而味拉王迫得遷都。至今橡皮價格猛落，而班哖和味拉却在對岸間奄奄對視，在不景氣下互相縮着手。</p>
<p>没有一個時間經濟的盛衰漲落得像南洋這麽快，也没有一個地方的盛衰起落得像味拉這麽地出人意表。味拉，這個寂靜的南海之濱，是一個畸形的經濟地理的變動的特殊例子底代表。</p>
<p>最末一次經過味拉的時候，看味拉市是在熱烈的陽光下將近死滅了，一想起和亮離開這個生地，在異地對我哭泣的形象，便對這灰色的古老的村市發起懷古的淡淡的哀傷，和對勞苦流血的工人們發起了向這世界抗戰般的悲憤。</p>
<h3>我的創作上的一個過程</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>算起來，從開始作小說起，已經有了五六個年頭了。</p>
<p>從前，我是迷戀着「文藝作品是給人作消遣品的」，所以寫出來的東西，總是在美酒，女人——一句話，在「享樂」上兜圈子。可是，緊接着，「九一八」事變，日本帝國主義的軍隊蹂躪了我的故鄉，「一二八」滬戰日本帝國主義的砲火，又摧毁了我攻讀的學校，這，使我不但要遙領着亡省奴的頭銜，同時還失去了上海求知居住的地方。我彷徨，我恐慌，我悲哀，我氣憤，終至，激起我反抗暴力的情緒！「醒醒罷，把你作小說的筆鋒改了方向不行麽」？我醒了，從昏沉的夢中警醒了自己問着自己。「你該把那種抒寫閑情逸致的筆調，轉爲反抗你的敵人的武器！譬如：暴露日本帝國主義在東北壓迫，屠殺，欺騙我們弱小民族的一類事情。同時，你也該抓住現社會的某一點，或是某一層，說上一些該說的話。</p>
<p>豐年——這集子裏的三篇小說，就是我夢醒後的收成，是我在一九三三年九月從上海回到東北，九月重行回到上海以後寫成，陸續在一九三四年「新中華」上發表的。我所以要回東北，說起來原因很簡單，就是要看一看故鄉殘破的河山和帝國主義鐵蹄下同胞們受到的一些塗炭，是否和我們在上海道聽塗說得來的情形一樣。事上實在後來給我證明出那是不一樣的！所以這集子裏的三篇東西，如果說還有可取的地方，首要推到它們的「眞實」。這也就是篇中內容的主旨。</p>
<p>其次，關於文字方面，在執筆時原就小心用事，謹防寫出來的是一些呌人看不懂的東西。因爲我自己就是一個深受文字生硬那一類文藝作品的害處的。</p>
<p>說這是一篇序，倒不如說是我幾年來創作上的一個過程，可是，没有這段過程，又怎能寫出這個集子呢。那麽，這也許不算是費話。</p>
<h3>明天（十二）</h3>
<p>— （Joseph　Cornad）著吳向隅譯</p>
<p>她突然呌出：「就是你！你自己他在等待呀。就是你明天要來呀。」</p>
<p>他喃喃地說。「呀！是我？」完全呆掉了，他們兩人都没有呼吸似的。顯然他在沉思他所聽到的事；隨後，雖然毫無怒氣，但却十分疑惑地說：「我不明瞭。我没有寫過信或其他一切事件，是我的同伴，他看到報紙，告訴我－就在今天早上······喲，還有什麽呢？」</p>
<p>他把耳朶傾向她；她很快地同他耳語，他聽了一會，喃喃地說「是的」，有時說「我曉得」，最後他問「但是爲什麽不今天呢？」</p>
<p>「你不瞭解我！」她不耐地說。西方在雲下面的一綫的亮光消失下去。他再微微傾身向前以求聽得清楚，昏黑的夜掩没了低語的女人與留心聽的男子的一切，除開他們的面孔親密的接近，帶着秘密的與溫情的神色以外。</p>
<p>他伸一伸他的肩胛；一頂闊邊帽子的黑影很神氣地戴在他的頭上。「這些多麽不痛快喲？」他向她訴說。「明天？」咿！咿！從來没有聽到講起這樣一件事過。難道，據我所能知道，都是明天，一些與今天無關涉。」</p>
<p>她仍舊動也不動，也不發一言。</p>
<p>「你也許鼓勵這種可笑的觀念吧，」他說。</p>
<p>「我從來没有違反過他。」</p>
<p>「你爲什麽不呢？」</p>
<p>「我爲什麽要？」他替她自己辯護。「那不過使他痛苦吧了。他也許會變成神智不清。」</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>社會的病態</h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>誰也不會否認的吧；在人類不斷地進化的歷史過程中，產生着各種不一的社會組織；這正是由於客觀的物質經濟關係所響影，所支配，更呈現着各各不同的社會形態。</p>
<p>本就法律說吧：牠正是每個社會里的生活形態之一。果然牠的本旨是在保護人類，但是牠却爲人類自己所創製的；同時，又得隨着每個不同的社會經濟組織而相互差異的。不過，要是你一旦違背或者破壞了當時社會里所定的法律，那就是「犯了罪」，而得受法庭的裁判。</p>
<p>然由於種種「犯罪」事件的發生，却可本質地反應了當時社會組織形態之一般了。</p>
<p>在這里，我們本得確信：時代的巨輪轉輾到這個二十世紀的輪齒之下，一切正是有着空前的進步了。但是，我們却也不能不見：卽使在今日一般「文明國」那里，種種「犯罪」案件的日趨於繁雜，激增，正成了社會中嚴重的病態之一，而爲不少的「社會學者」，以至那些專門的「犯罪學者」們所憂慮着，焦苦着的。</p>
<p>至於講到我們這個號稱爲「東方紐約」的上海——牠的外表是這樣的莊嚴，華麗！牠的進步是這樣的神速（！）——確是値得我們常人所歌頌，所留戀的吧？不過，牠却終是不避雅俗地不能例外的。據着最近公共租界工部局所發表的「十月份犯案統計」，是够人失望而驚心的了。</p>
<p>你看：單只公共租界十月份的里「刑事犯案」的統計，就有一千三百九十九件之多了，較之九月份的要增加一百四十九件。若與去年同期相較，要突增二百零四件之多。在這些案件內，盜竊案計有八百七十七件，較之九月份，增加一百七十六件。若較之去年同期，增加有一百七十一件。又關於其他各種犯案，也均有激增。</p>
<p>在這里，却又使人記起一椿糟糕透頂的事了：這就是那位XX大學里畢業出來的大學生，竟也去作那種偸摸摸不顧「廉恥」的勾當來了。但是到底「法網」難逃，「判决徒刑四月示儆」（見十一月二十一日各報）</p>
<p>對於這一次大學生的犯罪問題，確曾引起了社會上一般人士的注意，各方面都有輿論發表，檢討是非。</p>
<p>不過，堂堂學府里出來的學生，却作了偸兒而致犯罪，是成了事實。若是說得確切一些：那就正是我們今日一般地生活形態的更有力的反映，是這個社會里的病態的更嚴重，更具體的表現！</p>
<p>本來，關於人類種種犯罪問題的原因，是十分複雜，細繁的。要是就那般「犯罪學專家」們的分類，更有客觀的，主觀的，先天的，本能的，偶然的，職業的等等。然而，我們是誰也見得的：在今日這樣「市塲凋零」，「農村破產」的當見，又加上空前的天災，人禍···那末，犯罪案的日益激增，社會病態的日趨嚴重，决不會那末偶然而單純的。要知：每個社會問題的，終得先有着牠的客觀的物質經濟關係所響影，所支配的！什麽也不能例外！</p>

<h3>反「反拍」</h3>
<p>— 馬</p>
<p>「反拍」是反對「拍馬」的人，反「反拍」是反對「反拍」的人，作反「反拍」。前日拜讀談言中皮先生「反拍」的一文，在表面上似可贊同，而在事實上極爲反對。因爲善於「拍馬」的人，必定比較不善「拍馬」的人，來得稱意，得用。因爲善於「拍馬」的人，能「先意承旨」能「知風報信」能「脅肩諂笑」能「假獻殷勤」易得主人的歡心，所以俗語說，「千穿萬穿，馬屁不穿」內中很有大大的道理。</p>
<p>唐武三思常說，「我不知世間何者謂之善人，何者謂之惡人，但與我善者卽爲善人，與我惡者卽爲惡人」，這幾句話，說得非常痛快，非常聽得進。非常有道理，我苦無做主人的資格，倘然有了，立志非用此等人不可，因爲强頭强腦，不聽閒話的人，我一看見便要討厭。所以「鷹犬」「辟侫」「爪牙」「小人」最爲做主人的推心置腹的必要人物。</p>
<p>馬屁這樣東西，不但現在風行，就在歷史上看來，也是很重要的一種史跡，我且舉歷史的幾件事吧！歷史上此種事跡很多，我就舉幾件犖犖大者：</p>
<p>漢京師爲請平恩侯許伯入第，酒酣樂作，長信少府檀長卿起舞，爲沐猴與狗鬥，座皆大笑。</p>
<p>唐陸眷爲庫辱官家奴，會集，皆持吐壺。獨庫辱官吐入眷口，悉咽之，曰，願使主君之知慧祿相，盡入腹中。</p>
<p>楊再思爲相，專以諂諛取容，司禮少卿張同休，易之之兄，嘗因晏集，戲再思曰，楊內史面似高麗，再思欣然，剪紙帖巾，反披紫袍作高麗舞，舉坐大笑。</p>
<p>唐魏公嘗病，有僚屬某，素諂事公，造邸問候，見床前有穢器，舉之便飲，魏公蹙眉曰，何爲乃爾，對曰，穢甜者病難治，公之穢未甜，易愈也。</p>
<p>宋韓侂胃嘗與衆客游南園，過山莊，願竹離草舍曰，此眞田舍間氣象，但少鷄鳴犬吠耳。俄聞犬鳴叢薄，視之，乃師鐸也，侂胃大笑。</p>
<p>宋秦檜用事，王倫獻一便壺，裝成七寶，刻名於其傍，曰王倫敬呈，並箋云，昔漢帝每飯不忘鉅鹿下，僕依斯旨，敬呈便壺一具，亦欲相公時時不忘之耳。</p>
<p>明太監王振弄權，工部右侍郎王佑，貌美而無鬚，善伺候振顏色，一日王振問曰，王侍郎何以無鬚，對曰，老爺所無，兒安敢有。</p>
<p>明嚴嵩旣削，籍没其家，得一白玉便壺，甚精。上繫金牌，鐫文曰，趙文華孝敬。後遞文華，文華曰，彼欲污衊我爾，故繫金牌於此，其諂而且狡如此。</p>
<p>以上都是歷史上「拍馬」的史跡，無論什麽人，倘然碰到了長信少卿，楊再思，趙師鐸，王倫，趙文華，一流人物「馬屁」一五一十地拍上來，請問你窩心不窩心，快意不快意，所以對於皮先生「拍」的一文，我堅决地大爲反對。因爲皮先生恐尙未對於主人作一度着想呢？至於「拍馬」的用意何在，我不得而知，當去請問幾位善拍馬者。</p>
<h3>同情者</h3>
<p>— 雪</p>
<h3>白色的臉</h3>
<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>號子裏，整天的沉悶在黑暗的氛圍中，十幾個人，誰也感到呼吸的窒息，誰也希望着能够跑到外面的空地上去吸一口新鮮的空氣，雖然那空地上的空氣也不見得怎樣好，到處都是充滿着黑色的煤烟。可是，這在號子裏的人看起來，那裏的空氣，簡直是比那早晨的海濱還要好些，能够在那裏去深深地吸它一口，那是比較做神仙去都快活哩。</p>
<p>老周，那長滿着下腮的異鬍子的大塊頭，在這號子裏算是他最遲來的了。但因爲他長得太多的鬍子，不到幾天，已經比那住了十幾天的人更厲害了，看去眞像是一個囚徒了。因他是剛來的，對於這裏的黑暗世界和那沉悶的空氣，簡直使地悶死了，整天的在那不滿一丈寬的鐵栅邊走着，好像那跑慣了深山，初被困住鐵籠裏的老虎一樣，坐也不好，跑也不好的嘆着氣，趨着眉頭的一聲不嚮。</p>
<p>今天，天氣暖和了一點，一早大家就都起來了，誰都爭先的跑到那鐵栅門邊，伸長手的去那水桶裏打面巾洗臉，老周起得渥一點，那桶裏的只有半桶的水，都變成黑色了，他只好拿着面巾的低聲駡着：</p>
<p>「媽的，這還是洗臉的水，簡直是水溝裏的污水哩」！</p>
<p>「污水，還不好嗎？這還算是優待呢！要不然，連這點污水都没有哩，别的不說，你看看對過那一百多人吧！他們還不是那末一桶嗎？」</p>
<p>唐老頭子在號子裏是誰都知道他是喜歡說話的，雖然年紀已有四十多了，但因爲他對這種生活是過慣了，他也不覺到怎末樣，每天盡是鬧着玩，說笑話，談開心，都是他一個，好像在外面是他年最老，到這兒來却是年最青的小孩子。他這時看看老周的情形，曉得他心裏又是難過了，所以凑趣的說了幾句。</p>
<p>實在他難怪，像老周那樣的人，雖然今年已經有二十五六歲，但從來就没有吃過一點苦，讀書也不怎麽多，每天總是住在家裏，和着大小老婆玩，在他從來就没有夢想到，世界上會有這種地方，會有過着這種生活的人，就是對他自己，也從來就不會夢到會有住到這種地方的一天，這次的進到這鐵籠裏來，在他是感到很奇怪，好像做夢似地。</p>
<p>今天的北風，括得十分的兇猛，鐵籠裏，冰冷的没有半點熱氣，十幾個人</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>都縮頭縮腦的圍成一個圈子在角落裏，早晨的太陽，在他們，是看也看不見，只有那刺骨的寒風，括着他們的臉，刺進他們那單薄的衣服裏面的肉體，手和脚都好似是冰一樣的。</p>
<p>疲倦的，没有精神的十幾對眼睛，在那黑暗的角落裏轉動着，特别是老周那對大眼睛，不住的在上下翻動着。</p>
<p>「呀！咱們眞太傻了，你們看，太陽光不是照到這籠子裏來了嗎？大家去太陽光下照照吧！看是誰的白些。</p>
<p>約莫是九點多鐘了，那天窗的外面，透射進一綫太陽的紅光來，雖然那是隔着一重鐵紡，但在這黑暗的號子裏，却顯得格外的明亮。唐老頭子好似發見了什麽似地高興起來，呌着大家去站在那陽光下照照各人的没有血色的面孔。</p>
<p>關在號子裏的十幾個人，不見太陽光的十日二十日都有，今天太陽光的射進籠子裏來誰都感到興奮，誰都站在太陽光下去照一下。但是，那在黑暗裏籌没有發見的白色的面孔，却在太陽光下顯得更加的蒼白了。</p>
<p>本來大家都高興，可是這一來，誰的眉頭都縐起來了，誰都担心着血會一天天地乾下去，到了離開了籠子的時候，說不定連一點的血色都没有了，殘存着的就是一個白色的臉和死了一樣的軀體了。</p>
<h3>租房子的話</h3>
<p>— 宋元</p>
<p>一到了這東方巴黎的大都會－上海，你以爲到處都是新房子，無論什麽弄堂都有房子在召租，不要緊，只要荷包裏的鈔票麥克麥克就行，其實找房子就够你受氣。換句話說，都會中住的問題，並不怎樣的容易解决呵。</p>
<p>你是一個人嗎？單身漢，那就更加麻煩。當你揀選好了一條清潔幽靜的弄堂，打算在這裏住下是多麽舒服，那你一定是堅决地要在這裏租房子了。可是，越是弄堂清潔幽靜的地方，房子越不容易租到。當你各方找那紅紙頭寫黑字的召租帖的時候，你一定會詫異着；爲什麽這裏並没有房子出租呢。如果萬幸的被你找到了一紙半紙召租帖，按址敲門，裏頭的奶奶太太們引你上樓看房子，房子是光綫好空氣好而且十分清潔，你一定認爲滿意而要和她們講房錢了，可是，她第一句話問你，「是一個人，阿是有太太一起」？便使你呆住了。你心裏想要說「是一個人，那她看你呆住地站在那兒，她便先向你說了，「没有家眷不租」，還要說明理由，「上海地面壞人多來兮「···」將你獨身漢當做壞人送出後門口了。如果萬幸的碰到「有眷莫問」的房子，那是什麽團體的俱樂部，你一定以爲這回找到了房子了，没有太太不成問題，可是他們要你一個殷實店保，證明你是一個好人，不是壞人。如果你在上海找不到殷實店保，那你只得自認不是好人，不合用他們講話了。</p>
<p>清潔弄堂的房子，你橫了心，不想去光顧了，那就比較容易成功。最容易租成功的弄堂，是弄堂裏都是小販的呌賣聲的地方，而且在那裏好像房東是在爭着拉進房客似地，你一進門，只要價錢相合，她們是態度溫和親切，連小孩子都呌你一聲伯伯。可是，當你將行李傢俱搬進去以後，麻煩的事情立刻就來找你了。你的床喲桌喲還未曾佈置滿意的時候，房東太太立刻就來敲門。她不是來賀你的新居，而是擺着一副笑臉要向你拿房租。「上海租房子有規矩格，先付後住」。你如果想要合她商量，房錢先付一半，那是最好不用開口，她是絶對不答應的。而且她以爲你是猪頭三，不懂得上海的規矩，向你說了一大套關於租房子的什麽話，好像老早已經定下了章程，而你連這種章程不曉得。你如果不擺出是老上海神氣，說是對於租房子老門檻的話，那她的租屋章程立刻就要更改一下，照規矩是房客退房子在十天以前，房東退房客是半個月，她看你外行，她先照顧你說，「如果要退房子，應該先一個月說明」。如果你曉得規矩，合她爭，她至多也讓步至在半個月以前，到後來也賣個人情給你說「十天也好。大家好好格住下去，不搬塲更好啦」。等到你將房錢先付過後，她又告訴你，「我們的電燈是夜裏向十二點鐘，總門就關脫哉」。並不徵求你同意不同意，她算是通知你一聲。還有！好像十分關心你的事一樣，她呌你應該馬上就到公安局去報告登記，遲一天是要罰錢。你如果不懂得這門檻，或者不相信有這麽一回事，那她就要先噪急勸你一陣好話，後來竟至於要對你發脾氣了。「你不去登記，局裏向要罰房東的錢，我受不起的啦」！</p>
<p>在上海租房子實在够麻煩的啦。信不信由你去吧。</p>

<p>兪筱雲兪筱霞玉蜻蜓</p>
<p>新聲（一三八○）下午六時至七時</p>
<p>開篇「寳玉夜探瀟湘館」</p>
<p>隆冬寒露結成冰。月色迷濛欲斷魂。一陣陣朔風透入骨。鳥洞洞的大觀園裏冷清清。賈寳玉一路花街繞。脚步輕移緩緩行。他是一盞燈。一個人。黑影憧憧更愁悶。孤單單獨自到瀟湘館。去看有林妹妹病體可减輕。輕敲銅鐶滴搭響。紫鵑小婢忙開門。說道二爺呀你深宵寒令宜當心。姊姊呀我是放心不下你林姑娘。特地前來問安寗。行來已到病榻右。只見他氣息奄奄不則聲。一個呌林妹妹。一個把表兄稱。她是杏眼微開雙淚淋。說道哥哥呀二嫂嫂待我不該應。老祖宗雖然心愛好。何奈他耳聾眼花不靈敏。我此身的病體不可好。又不能日日去把安請。哥哥呀我與你前世的孽債今世了。請你貴公子不管我這薄命人。妹妹呀你一生就是多煩憫。何必自己太看輕。想您有什麽心儘事管說。我與你兩人合一心。我勸你一日三餐多飲食。我勸你衣衫宜添要留神。我勸你養身先養心。何苦自己把煩惱尋。我勸你姊妹言語不可聽。他們是似假又似眞。我勸你早早安歇莫夜深。病中不宜磨黃昏。我勸你一切心事多丢開。更不要想起蘇州舊牆門。那黛玉暗暗把頭點。哥哥的言語我記在心。心暗轉。更傷心。寃家爲我最留神。淚珠兒滾滾流不住。涓涓濕透了香羅巾。此生未必太飄零。</p>
<h3>周劍虹大紅袍</h3>
<p>中西（一○四○）十一時三刻至十二時半　　開篇「學堅」</p>
<p>一生名宦守南邦。兩袖清風詩一囊。政簡刑清無一事。羞隨俗吏送迎忙。晚歲無兒悲伯道。眼前有女慰中郎。姣養深國猶待字。惜蹉跎尙未選東床。延名師。陳最良。內衙設帳課紅裝。賢小姐。小梅香。殷勤拜見上廳堂。女學生當作男兒待。朝朝暮暮講詞章。伴讀青衣年紀小。幾番唐突老年蒼。不尊師命難寬恕。取荆條痛打理應當。幸千金。善包荒。從今不可再顚狂。臨晋帖。取文房。簪花體格妙無雙。先生僞把葩經咏。講到關睢詩一張。麗娘忽地動愁腸。莫來由君子好述四個字。坎對從此種。脈脈無言返上房。十分愁悶俺蘭床。</p>
<h3>話劇</h3>
<p>上海無綫電劇社</p>
<p>永生（一○八○）下午四時半至五時半</p>
<p>「落霞孤鶩」</p>
<p>夜深了，人聲也靜寂了，婦女留養院裏的女生全都是進了夢鄉，祗有馮玉如和落霞，却依枕對坐着細談各人的經歷和情史。誰知落霞的心目中的愛人－江秋鶩－就是馮玉如理想中的戀人，但是，她們倆仍相愛如初，絶對没有想到對方就是自己的情敵。</p>
<h3>觀音社</h3>
<p>中西（一○四○）下午七時一刻至八時</p>
<p>「水滸林冲」</p>
<p>高衙內的妙計，完全失敗了；可是林冲知道這計策是陸虞候出的，拿着刀去找他拚命，陸虞候嚇得躱在衙門裏不敢出來。林冲一連等了三天，不見陸虞候，只得回到家中忍氣悶坐，可是高衙門自從在陸虞候家中被鶩嚇後，回到家中就病在床上了。</p>
<p>中華（一一四○）下午八時一刻至九時</p>
<p>「歡喜寃家」</p>
<p>女人眞可思，這並不是我故意侮辱，事實是這樣的：忠厚的王玉和爲了白桂英而失業了，那是多麽慘的一件事！雖然說爲了戀愛什麽都可以犧牲的，可是失業後的悲痛，恐怕不是戀愛所能補償的吧？</p>
<p>李樹德堂（九四○）下午九時至十時</p>
<p>「落霞孤鶩」</p>
<p>馮玉如進了婦女留養院已有三年之久了，這天黃院長把玉如呌了來，把她應當擇配的事情說明白了，玉如也答應了。黃院長就拿了玉如的像片，找他朋友李少菴去說媒，誰知再也想不到，少菴給玉如找的對象就是玉所朝思暮想的那個人，也就是落霞理想中的人江秋鶩。</p>
<p>華美（一○六○）下午十時至十一時</p>
<p>「滿江紅」</p>
<p>李桃枝由清凉山回來了，把她所聽見的事通通告訴秦小香，硬拉着秦小香一同到東南大戲院去看莫新野表演「曼特林」。李桃枝還恐怕碰見熟人，二人都化了裝。因爲到東南大戲院去，所以他的日戲又躭誤唱了，桃枝的鴇婆又是一頓的敎訓。</p>

<p>— 李賓</p>
<p>好萊塢美麗明星卡洛朗巴（Carole　Lombard）的生活，簡直的是一個一個笑話連貫不斷的。她簡直是爲笑而生的。她的豐富的幽默性，惟一發洩之處就是弄送人，或者惡作劇。古人說：「不作無聊之事，何以遺有涯之生」。再洛朗巴是深得此中三昧的人。她的日常生活，和她的一班朋友，羞不多都是每天每夜在尋着笑話開開心。老話說得好；同聲相應，同氣相投；卡洛朗巴旣然如此，和她相聚的一班朋友，當然也是物以類聚了。你要是受不了她的笑話，你簡直不用去和她交朋友。你要是神筋太敏銳，經不起她的愚弄，你簡直見都不要見她。但是倘使你具有和她同等的幽默心思，那你就會覺得她的妙趣環生，和笑料的充牣了。</p>
<p>譬方的說，好萊塢一般明星，誰願意在演著最羅曼諦克的幕序的時候，突然有人在旁邊哈哈大笑起來；或者他的笑劇放映的時候，大家看了都默默不作聲；或者在唱得最得意的時候，幾個朋友大踏步地笑着離開了。以上所說的，就是著名歌星平克勞斯貝親身所歷的惡作劇。那就是在加泰琳那島的一家戲院，放映平克勞斯貝的最近歌舞新片的時候，卡洛朗巴突然率領了一班朋友，跑了進去。她說是去恭賀平克勞斯的成功的，可是她恭賀的方法太奇突了。但是平克勞斯貝，却亦是一位大好佬，幽默性的豐富，不亞於卡洛。他知道卡洛是來尋他的開心的，所以等到她率領一班朋友，大笑而去的時候，他竟追了出去，在卡洛的的後面狂喊着：「等等我！我和你們一同去」！他亦跟着卡洛去尋開心了。當然平克勞斯貝是明明知道卡洛是尋他的開心，但是好萊塢有幾個明星，能够受得了這種大庭廣衆之中的惡作劇的呢？</p>
<p>卡洛朗巴和平克勞斯貝的惡作劇，亦不是這一次了。有一天，導演瑙門泰羅率領了大批人馬，坐了他的私人游艇，出去尋覓外景地點，並且順便作樂休息。預先大家已經約定，各人都要帶些食物去欵待朋友。平克勞斯貝徧徧忘記了帶東西　，貿貿然跑到游艇裏。大家都知道平克勞斯貝素來是以健忘着稱的。這一次他大槪也是忘記了，說他是個猶太人，不肯化錢。平被她纒得無法，就答應她船一靠岸，他請大家喝香檳酒。可是後來大家已經到了加泰琳那島上了。大家還是没有香檳喝。顯而易見的，平克勞斯貝又早已忘得影踪全無了。到了明天，平正在拍戲的時候，他突然接到了一封電報。他打開一看，上面祗寫着「現在」兩個字。他知道卡洛又在和他開玩笑了。他亦就一笑置之。不想過了十五分鐘，正在拍戲上緊的時候，他又接到一封電報。打開一看，亦是白紙上寫着「現在」兩個字。他又一笑置之。隔了十分鐘，他又接到了一封電報，裏面亦是同樣的「現在」兩個字。再隔了五分鐘，又是一封電報。從此以後，每隔一分鐘，來一個電報。這樣弄得平克勞斯貝，心慌意亂，拍戲都不能聚精會神起來。到最後，他才覺悟到，他允許大家的香檳酒，還没有踐約。他於是立即呌香檳。居然香檳一到，電報亦就不到了。但是他已經收到了五十多封電報。當然，電報費是統通Charge在平克勞斯貝賬上的了。</p>
<p>當然，專門弄送人，亦有自己上當的時候。卡洛朗巴自己亦承認，曾經上過導演瑙門泰羅的大當。她現在講起來，還哈哈大笑呢。瑙門最近拍一張片子，裏面用了一隻大熊。可是那只熊，訓練並不純熟。等到戲拍完，他已經滿頭大汗了。從此以後，他非但不要再看見熊，並且不要再聽見提起熊的名字。卡洛朗巴聽見了，却徧徧弄了一只大熊，將大木箱裝了，等瑙門晚上要睡覺的時候，派人送到他家裏。瑙門看見了卡洛送他的大熊，起初很生氣。後來他想，她旣然想愚弄他，何妨想個方法來抵制一下。他想了半天，不覺眉頭一縐，計上心來。他立即吩咐去呌蓄獸塲的人來，將那隻熊用汽車裝到蓄獸塲裏，說那是卡洛朗巴的寶貝，要小心飼養。並且替熊造了一間特别精緻的房間，一切費用，都歸卡洛支付，不想那只大熊，一到蓄獸塲就大病，就特别請了著名的獸醫，用了日夜班的看護，養了好幾個月，將熊的病治好了，從新將熊車到卡洛家裏，並且附了一筆養育醫藥的賬。這一下子，害了她自己好幾千塊錢的損失。但是卡洛上了自己的當，反哈哈大笑起來。</p>
<p>以上的話，當然亦不是完全没有意思的。外國人說，中國人是完全没有幽默性的。動動就生氣，發脾氣。戲院，酒館，本來是尋樂之所，却徧徧常常遇見謾駡相爭，揎拳毆鬥之事。讀了這一段文章，才知道「知趣常樂」的道理，不必徒自苦也。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「情場女俠」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Lady　by　Choice－國泰</p>
<p>老女演員梅羅波蓀（May　Robson）之後，又演了這一部足以發揮她演技的作品。再加上卡珞朗白（Carole　Lombard）的强調個性之演技的配合，「情塲女俠」在演技方面是可以使人滿足的。但可惜優秀的演技，建築在一個幻想的故事上了。因着故事不是現實的表現，結果優秀的演技也只等於浪費，因爲劇中的一切，並不使人有眞實的感動。</p>
<p>什麽是劇的主題？一個不顧道德而常常觸犯刑章的少女，應當和一心愛的少年結合。劇作者爲了逹到這一主題，他使一個流浪老婦，在生活滿足之後，便成爲一個堂堂正正的高貴的太太，不喝酒，不胡鬧滋事，作爲少女的模範。如此說敎作用，乃是用不着說得的了。</p>
<p>也許人們以爲一個舞女的私人宣傳員，將舞女被捕或徵求母親都作爲頂好的宣傳資料；頗爲輕鬆有趣，但這除非爲了少年少女的結合之外，是没有其他作用的。</p>
<p>看完了這一影片之後，我們除了覺得梅蘿波蓀演技極好之外，其他方面並不給我們更深的印象。前半部非常輕鬆而活潑有趣，導演大衛巴唐（David　Burton）在這些地方確是處理得非常成功的，但在後半部却漸漸的淪於凝滯與沉悶。</p>
<p>其他没有什麽可說的了。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>關於「神女」的演出</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>當我看完了「神女」一片之後，覺得這位新進的劇作者之前途，實有偉大的希望。當然，他在這初次的處女作裏，已經給了我們些良好的印象了。</p>
<p>無疑的，在這裏便可以看出劇作者對於現社會，已有了相當的理解，雖然他的主觀尙有應該商榷的地方。</p>
<p>「神女」在題材上，無論如何總是一個很現實的表現，這雖僅是一個單純的故事，但却已把社會的，倫理的悲劇很順利的發展開來；一個女人爲了自己的愛子，而不惜去出賣自己的肉體，靈魂；更爲了想使孩子成人向上，所以願把賣笑所得的錢給孩子求學；可是勢利的敎育家却要追究他家長的職業，這呌她怎樣回答得去呢？終於使孩子得不到敎育的機會，而冷嘲熱諷的難堪，更使她非常的悲痛！</p>
<p>無賴的强佔私娼，她爲了環境的支配，祗有忍受着冷酷的待遇，和無情的蹂躏而被屈服在魔鬼的鐵蹄淫威之下，但最後終究是忍無可忍的而受了十二年的徒刑！</p>
<p>「這是一個社會問題」，這句話，我相信誰也不會否認的，這被劇作者很正確地抓住了，而且在他聰明的分析之下，便强調地借着老校長的口述而發展開來，這微妙的手法，眞是難能可貴的。</p>
<p>講到導演方面，也有不少新的收穫，如（一）從章志直袴下攝取阮玲玉和黎鏗以表示被屈服，（二）阮玲玉在章志直掌中的復攝，說明她跳不出他的掌握，（三）阮玲玉在法庭受審和入獄塲面轉換等，都是不可多得的成功。除此之外，全劇故事的叙述也很簡潔明快；不過高潮部份的平淡，似乎缺少斟酌。</p>
<p>演出上，阮玲玉的二重人格之表現很有力，黎鏗的演技天才自然也不會使我們失望的，章志直活像一個典型「白相人」，李君磐也頗使人滿意。</p>
<p>末了，我們更期待着吳君，第二次有更大的貢獻來和我們相見。</p>

<h3>母女緣（Lady　by　Choice）（八）</h3>
<p>— 仲嘉</p>
<p>亞拉班聽見莊尼說，他寗可放棄了家財而娶她爲妻，就高興得熱淚直流道：「你是個百萬家私的少年，並且爲了我，情願放棄家財，但是你能不能答應我，將來一生都過着窮日子呢？」莊尼笑着喊了起來道：「我們將來窮得像呌化子一樣。我們賺了錢，化得它一個錢不留。我們老了，就搬到養老堂裏去。這就是從我良心裏說出來的話。「他說完了，就抱着亞拉班狂吻起來。亞拉班這時，已經是快樂得如痴如夢。她像到了一個舊遊的仙境，那裏是她做小姑娘的時候，曾經作夢到過的，遠在她更變了她的個性之前哩。那個夢境，現在又重現於她的目前了。到了明天，亞拉班忽然接到了逹理庭長的電話呌她去。她就立即跑到庭長那裏。庭長看着她，覺得有些希奇，他和這位羽扇舞的專家，本有一面之緣，現在命運之神，却又將她帶到他的面前。幾個月之前，她曾經因爲裸體跳舞被捕，而被她釋放了。現却在他職務以外，要和這個女子開些談判，因爲已經有兩個人，來求他帮忙，干涉這個女子的行爲。一個是莊尼的母親，一個就是潘茜，當他聽見她們陳述了情節之後，他覺得她們的見解是不錯的。現在他又看見這女子，站在他面前，當他提起了莊尼的名字的時候，她的眼睛幾乎瑩然欲涕了。當他勸告她，不要和莊尼結婚的時候，她的嘴唇驚懼得發抖了。當他告訴她，她必定會糟塌了莊尼一生的前程的時候，他可以看得出她內心的痛苦。不過他又想到，她是一位女伶，或者她在他的面前，表演一下子亦未可知。但是到最後，她竟聽了逹理庭長的勸告，答應她不和莊尼結婚。亞拉班退出去的時候，她又在屋子看見了潘茜。潘茜看見了亞拉班，就走上去摟住了她，吻着她的唇。亞拉班亦不覺高興了起來。潘茜亦知道，亞拉班已經換了一個人了，所以當亞拉班求她一同回去的時候，她們就一同去。可是從此之後，亞拉班的眼睛裏和嘴唇上，不再看得見她的笑容了，并且電話鈴一響，她就嚇得發抖。她拒絶見莊尼，並且連話都不知他講潘茜看了這副情景，她想起了從前亦曾經有這麽一位女郎，爲了愛情，竟一夜哭到天明。她亦是這樣悲傷難過，祗爲了她要做一件合理的事，將她的愛人忘記了，而那位愛人的音容笑貌，亦居然是和現在的莊尼一般無二的。那時的那個女郎，現在那裏去了？她到了後來，就變成了一個老邁龍鍾的潘茜。她想起了從前自己所經所歷的一切，她怎忍再看着亞拉班重蹈她的覆轍。後來亞拉班又去找她從前的經理肯道爾重新恢復了她羽扇舞的生活。這一下子，潘茜愈加忍不住了。她就跑到莊尼那裏，一五一十的將亞拉班的近事講給他聽了。於是莊尼和潘茜，就立即再跑到逹理庭長那裏。當天晚上，亞拉班跳舞的地方，又被警察包圍了，將亞拉班捉了去，亞拉班被捉之後，她一味地狂笑。當然那並不是歡樂放蕩的笑，她的笑聲之中，却帶着心中無限的痛苦，和對於人生的讐恨。她被帶到庭長的面前，還是一味冷笑着。庭長裝着鎭靜的態度道：「又捉起來了，是不是？這回我可要將從前宣佈情形的分處執行了。你有什麽話說？」亞拉班冷笑道：「你儘管執行好了。没有什麽人阻擋你呀」莊尼聽了，突然走上前來，摟住了她說道：「不是的，寶貝。還有一條路好走，就是你嫁給我。不然的話······」亞拉班不覺驚呼道：「你！她想要勸他不要痴心妄想。以致妨害了吧的前途，但是她却開不了口了，因爲莊尼的唇，已經將她的嘴封住了，因爲潘茜和庭長亦都看了他們，相視而笑。（完）</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhen's Investigation of Overseas Chinese Affairs in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Zhen said that he went to Southeast Asia to investigate overseas Chinese affairs in the Philippines, Java, Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Burma, Siam, and other places. He investigated the overseas Chinese affairs in all the places he passed through. There are millions of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, with a history of over 700 years. They have diligently engaged in industry and commerce. After the European War, economic panic and national disasters increased. Countries such as the Philippines, Annam, and Burma revised their immigration regulations, restricting the import of overseas Chinese. The Malay Peninsula and other places restricted the number of immigrants, reducing the import of overseas Chinese. The Dutch East Indies and Siam increased the population tax, reducing the number of overseas Chinese imports. In other respects, as the scholars' knowledge gradually improves, the status of our overseas Chinese is also affected. However, although the situation of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia is not as good as it used to be, it is still more comfortable than that of compatriots in the interior. Whether they will be able to return to their original state in the future depends on whether domestic politics can be rectified and whether diplomacy can be successful. I have no proposals for the Fifth Plenary Session. (Special dispatch on the 9th)</p>

However, regarding the types, amounts, and values of bonds to be deposited, a list should still be prepared in accordance with Article 20 of the Regulations of the Savings Deposit Guarantee Reserve Management Committee and Article 12 of the Detailed Rules of the Committee and submitted to the Committee for review and approval to ensure responsibility.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Significance of Celebrating the Victory Over the Communists - Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>The victory over the Communists is indeed the unified sentiment of all our people,</p>
<p>And the result of the joint efforts of comrades in the rear.</p>
<p>In recent days, compatriots from all over the country, celebrating the completion of the Communist suppression in Jiangxi Province, the Communist nests accumulated over the years, fundamentally destroyed, and the Communist-held areas of Fujian and Jiangxi gradually recovered, expectations of several years fulfilled in one day, have held grand celebrations of the victory over the Communists. They have also given warm慰問 to the Communist suppression soldiers. Today, the capital and Shanghai have also held grand gatherings. Telegrams of慰勉 arrive one after another. I, Chiang Kai-shek, am even more惶愧 about this. From the perspective of the Communist suppression soldiers, the Red bandits harm the country and the people, a common anger shared by all. They have long sought their destruction. Until now, I still feel guilty for not fulfilling my duty. How dare I accept such encouragement? From the perspective of the nation, eliminating violence and punishing evil is an execution of heavenly justice. As for eradicating the bandits, there is no real victory to speak of. Moreover, wherever the troops go, the people are affected, with casualties, disabilities, and scars everywhere. How can we bear to speak of victory? Thinking about the pain after it subsides, there is only sorrow. If we must speak of the victory over the Communists, is it not more accurate to say it is the victory of the people? Therefore, today's celebration is truly a celebration of the victory of our entire nation. I hope that our people will be united, continue their efforts, see it through to the end, and eliminate the evil influence, so as not to betray today's grand celebration. I, Chiang Kai-shek, have said that suppressing the Communists requires seven parts political power, and military force is only three parts. Today's success in suppressing the Communists, while the Party and the country cannot bear to forget the loyalty of the officers and soldiers who died and sacrificed at the front, is especially due to the comrades in the rear who worked hard and endured hardships, without fear of difficulties, consolidating politics, maintaining order, planning finances, and raising military supplies with perseverance and hard work. This enabled the officers and soldiers at the front to have no shortage of weapons and ammunition, and to have no lack of pay and provisions, eliminating worries about the rear, and encouraging them to advance bravely. In short, it is the result of the joint efforts of the front and rear. The support and encouragement of comrades and compatriots in the rear in various aspects of politics and society have been especially significant. I, Chiang Kai-shek, on behalf of the officers and soldiers at the front, would like to express my sincere gratitude to the comrades in the rear who are responsible for political, financial, security, transportation, and public opinion matters. I also confirm that the greatest force behind the success of this Communist suppression is the unified and unwavering sentiment of the people across the country who hate the Red bandits and vow not to coexist with them. The manifestation of this unified sentiment not only gave the soldiers fighting at the front infinite encouragement and comfort, but also gave those who had gone astray the determination to turn back and return. The trend of popular sentiment is enough to prove that the Communist bandits' hypocritical and cruel actions cannot exist in the world, and are especially intolerable to the Chinese people. From the experience of this Communist suppression, it can be seen that the power of a unified public sentiment is unparalleled. This kind of intangible power surpasses any tangible power and is enough to overcome any difficulty. If the unified sentiment used in the past for suppressing the Communists is used for saving the country, I believe that any crisis facing the nation can be averted by the unified sentiment of our people. And what demonstrates the unified sentiment of the whole country is the support of the government's domestic and foreign policies and the firm belief that the policies implemented by the government will surely reap the final results. I, Chiang Kai-shek, hope that my compatriots will think deeply about this. During the Communist suppression, if the people of the whole country had not regarded the success or failure of the Communist suppression as their own vital interest, and had not had a unified trust and expectation in the Communist suppression military, giving various spiritual and material encouragement, then how could this huge national disaster have been eliminated amidst such great difficulties? The previous example is clear. The national crisis is not over. I earnestly hope that my compatriots will cherish this valuable lesson and use the same sentiment for suppressing the Communists to unite in saving the country. Then the soldiers who sacrificed in suppressing the Communists will be able to rest in peace, and the honors, rewards, and benefits will be even greater. As for the remnant Communists in Jiangxi Province, although there are still remnants who have escaped westward, we firmly believe that the deep-rooted Communist nests in southern Jiangxi, which have been entrenched for many years, have been eradicated. The remaining fleeing bandits are like frightened animals running in disarray, having lost their foothold, and are scattered and weak. In the future, their complete elimination will certainly not be as difficult as when we attacked their main nests. The goal of the roving bandits is Sichuan and Guizhou. Although the land of Sichuan and Guizhou is vast and the products are abundant, surpassing those of southern Jiangxi, the people of Sichuan and Guizhou are inherently strong, have strong self-defense capabilities, and deeply hate the Red bandits. They will certainly not be as easily coerced or tempted as the people of southern Jiangxi. The westward fleeing of the bandits will have no foothold in Sichuan and Guizhou. Observing the notorious bandit chiefs of past dynasties, none did not mark their demise and collapse with their entry into Sichuan and Guizhou. We can believe that future suppression will be easier. Our armed comrades must act with their greatest determination and make their last effort to eliminate this national disaster, so as to comfort the expectations of the elders and compatriots across the country. I further hope that the whole country will be united, sincere, and unremitting, and work together to eliminate this obstacle to revival, so as to lay a new foundation for the nation.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia's Hostility Towards Hungary Increases Tension in Central Europe</h3>
<p>3,000 Hungarian僑민 Expelled Back Home</p>
<p>Serbs Repeatedly Invade Hungarian Territory</p>
<p>France and Italy Side with Each Side, Britain Acts Cautiously</p>
<p>(London) The Yugoslavian authorities' campaign of hostility against Hungarian 僑민 shows no signs of abating, hence the situation in Central Europe is more tense than before. Last night, a number of Hungarians returned to Hungary from Yugoslavia. Up to now, 3,000 Hungarian僑민 have been expelled from Yugoslavia. These people, young and old, knelt beside their hastily packed bags upon reaching the 四格特 station on the border, praying to God to protect them, to arrive safely in a place where their lives would no longer be endangered.</p>
<p>After the arrival of the most recent batch of refugees, Hungarian university students gathered to demonstrate against Yugoslavia. The Hungarian authorities quickly dispatched a large police force to prevent further incidents.</p>
<p>It has been reported that several invasions have occurred along the border. The most recent one involved a team of armed Serbians penetrating 300 yards into Hungarian territory. However, the Hungarian government has remained calm and focused on providing relief to the refugees, showing a desire to gradually calm public anger.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the Yugoslavian capital reduced the severity of the sudden conflict between the two countries. The authorities indicated that the process of expelling Hungarian僑민 would continue, but a more moderate policy would be adopted. It is rumored that the Hungarian army authorities have decided that if the Yugoslav army implements its policies, they would rather abandon the town of 四格特, because the area offers little defensibility. Last night, the Hungarian capital authorities denied reports that reinforcements had been sent to the border.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Council of the League of Nations in Geneva reopened to discuss Yugoslavia's memorandum to Hungary for the bloodshed of Marseille. The representatives, especially British Lord Privy Seal Eden, tried hard not to involve politics, but to discuss purely from a legal point of view. This effort clearly did not have any effect, because French Foreign Minister Laval announced with eloquent words that France supported Yugoslavia on all counts raised in the Marseille bloodshed case, while Italian representative Aloisi spoke in defense of Hungary. However, both politicians agreed to propose to the Council of the League of Nations to take international action to deal with terrorism. Laval announced France's support for Yugoslavia, saying, "France stands on the side of Yugoslavia on this serious matter. Those who shot King Alexander were trying to destroy peace. They were trying to destroy King Alexander's work. It is up to us, the Council of the League of Nations, to ensure that peace is not endangered." Britain's view was that the whole case was judicial in nature, and that the League of Nations should consider Yugoslavia's memorandum as a court. Russian representative Litvinov also gave a brief speech, denouncing terrorism. British representative Eden strongly urged the representatives to separate facts from will and policy. Eden said that the responsibility for the Marseille bloodshed case is difficult to determine at this time, because those allegedly responsible have not yet been tried. The current discussion should therefore continue to the next meeting of the Executive Yuan at 10:30 AM on Monday, and the Executive Yuan announced that it would adjourn until the meeting.</p>
<p>Hungary has sent a memorandum to the League of Nations regarding the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia, denying that the Hungarian government or Hungarian authorities lacked enthusiasm in controlling Yugoslavian fugitives, and defending that the Hungarian authorities had issued passports to a Yugoslavian terrorist party. It further stated that anyone who illegally crossed the border would be handed over to civil and military authorities for trial in accordance with the regulations for preventing espionage in various countries.</p>
<p>The Yugoslavian Minister to Geneva commented on yesterday's meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, saying, "Can we expect our people to be satisfied if you consider the resolution with a magnifying glass, hoping to find the guilt of the mastermind who murdered our monarch?" His meaning was that he felt the Council of the League of Nations' attitude towards Hungary was too lenient. From the current situation, it seems that the Council of the League of Nations will, on the one hand, pass a resolution condemning the Marseille bloodshed case, and, on the other hand, conclude an international convention stipulating the treatment of political fugitives.</p>
<p>The Paris newspapers commented on yesterday's declaration by Czech Foreign Minister Beneš that the Little Entente countries were prepared to defend their territorial integrity with war, also believing that the activities of those advocating revision of the peace treaty had endangered the peace of Europe. One newspaper said that in the event of war, even the League of Nations would not be able to maintain peace. Another newspaper said that Beneš's declaration was timely and would deal a fatal blow to those advocating revision of the treaty (8th Reuters dispatch).</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull solemnly announced today that the United States will take a bystander attitude towards the dispute between Yugoslavia and Hungary (8th dispatch from the National News Agency).</p>
<h3>Speeches by Various National Representatives</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations continued its meeting at 3:00 PM today to discuss the issue of political responsibility for the Marseille assassination, as requested by Yugoslavia. Representatives from France, Italy, Russia, Britain, and Spain all made important speeches. The Council then adjourned the meeting until Monday to continue the discussion. The following is a summary of the speeches of the representatives of major powers:</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Laval spoke on behalf of the French government, saying that France and Yugoslavia shared the same fate in the Marseille bloodshed case. The French Foreign Minister and the Yugoslavian King were assassinated at the same time. Alexander I was the founder of Yugoslavian unity. The thugs wanted him to die, and their intention was to destroy peace. Now that the Yugoslavian King has passed away, his peace cause must continue to exist and must be protected. Recently, when discussing the Saar issue, the Council expressed that it could use material force to prevent order from being disturbed. Now, for this case, the League of Nations has the same responsibility. Acts that violate the law should not be used as political tools. Therefore, I advocate that the Council should take action and jointly discuss and agree on international sanctions before it can be said to be complete.</p>
<p>Italian representative Baron Aloisi spoke after Laval, first praising the achievements of Yugoslavian King Alexander and French Foreign Minister Barthou, and then quoting Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, inviting Italy to participate in the Geneva debate with the desire for cooperation and peace. At this critical moment, the International Union should assume the task of疏解. Now, before us, someone is severely reprimanding a country, and even hurting its national honor. Hungary's rebuttal of this kind of 伸訴 is out of 公道, and its request that the Council immediately handle this case and clarify the truth is Hungary's due right and obligation. As for the revision of the treaty mentioned by Hungarian representative Eckhart, its nature is peaceful and completely different from terrorism. The Council has already recorded this declaration, which is enough. Italy initially advocated that the treaty should be suitable for the new needs of the times, because only in this way can the peace be guaranteed. However, the revision of the treaty to suit the new needs must be done in a legal way. Italy will also consider the issue of taking international action to suppress terrorism proposed by the French Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov spoke from the 壇, saying that he should reserve his opinion on the facts of this case, but he believed that Yugoslavia and France had the right to 伸訴 to the Council and request judgment. Litvinov then recounted his brief history of terrorism, saying that since the war, terrorism has emerged in layers. This kind of terrorist action is mostly reactionary in nature, and often prepared in foreign territories, and some of them are aimed at provoking conflicts between the two countries. No country should allow the existence of such actions. We hate individual terrorism even more. As for the Marseille bloodshed case, which is enough to endanger international peace, the League of Nations has the responsibility to maintain peace and should handle it well. In short, international unity is obviously necessary for this kind of problem.</p>
<p>Then British Lord Privy Seal Eden spoke, first mourning the national funeral of Yugoslavia, saying that it was unfortunate that these facts could now be calmly and calmly discussed on the议坛. The accomplices in this case are still in prison, and the investigation has not yet been completed, so it is extremely difficult to express an opinion at present. Eden then made a general statement on Yugoslavia's proposed prevention of terrorism, saying that the British people attach great importance to the right of asylum that political prisoners should enjoy, but freedom and indulgence should not be confused. The British government will never allow the preparation of violent actions that endanger the authorities of other countries within its borders. The most important thing at present is to ease the air, to prevent international hatred from continuing to grow, and to do our best to assist the Council to limit the scope of the problem and prevent it from expanding.</p>
<p>Then the Polish representative also rose to speak, saying that Poland, located between Hungary and Yugoslavia, two friendly countries, should maintain an impartial attitude. If the League of Nations stipulates a mutual assistance system for countries to prohibit such crimes, Poland is also prepared to cooperate.</p>
<p>Finally, Spanish representative Madariaga spoke, first praising the calm attitude of Yugoslavia, France, and Hungary, saying that the establishment of the Council of the League of Nations is not only to uphold justice, but also, and more importantly, to take action. The Council should now remain calm and wait for the arrival of a time when all parties can compromise. In addition, various remedial measures should be taken, such as banning the arms trade. There were also speeches by representatives of other countries, praising the Yugoslavian King and French Foreign Minister Barthou, which will not be recorded in detail (9th dispatch from Havas).</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Seeks Compromise</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations has been discussing the dispute between Yugoslavia and Hungary over the Marseille assassination for days, but has not yet reached a decision. This issue is closely related to the peace of Europe, so French Foreign Minister Laval will spend all his time looking for a way to establish a resolution. This resolution must satisfy Yugoslavia, must not violate the will of other countries, and must obtain the unanimous approval of all countries attending the Council, including Hungary. Laval has consulted with the Greek representative and will hold talks with Italian representative Aloisi, British representative Eden, or other national representatives this afternoon. In addition, Laval met with Yugoslavian Foreign Minister Jevtić this morning, and Jevtić informed Laval of the maximum extent of the concessions made by Yugoslavia and its allies. The meeting of the Council on Saturday and Sunday created a situation that was not conducive to a friendly resolution of this issue. As a result, all parties related to Geneva and the capitals of the Little Entente and the Balkan League were greatly disappointed. The problem is that procedural issues have made the resolution of this problem even more complicated. According to Article 11 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, this problem is applicable to reconciliation procedures, and all resolutions must be passed unanimously. Yugoslavia and Hungary, the two parties involved, have equal voting rights with other countries attending the Council, so it is even more difficult to establish a resolution (9th dispatch from Havas).</p>
<h3>British, Italian, Dutch, and Swiss Police Sent to Maintain Security in the Saar</h3>
<p>Decision of the Council of the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations today passed a resolution inviting Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden to jointly dispatch personnel to form an international police force to maintain security in the Saar during the plebiscite in mid-January next year (8th dispatch from the National News Agency).</p>
<p>(Geneva) The issue of international police entering the Saar to maintain security was discussed at the Council of the League of Nations meeting this afternoon. Baron Aloisi presented a report that all countries willing to join the international police force and Germany have already agreed, and the German government has officially replied in writing to the Tripartite Committee expressing its agreement, so the Tripartite Committee asked the General Assembly to pay attention to this point, and all necessary procedures were completed by Czech Foreign Minister Beneš who formally moved to pass, and it was resolved to appoint an international committee to facilitate the process (8th dispatch from the National News Agency).</p>
<p>(London) The Dutch government has accepted the invitation of the League of Nations to dispatch a team to participate in the international police force to maintain order during the Saar plebiscite, but a Reuters interviewer stationed in the Dutch capital asked the authorities whether the Netherlands would dispatch troops, and the authorities denied this, saying that such official consultations have not yet begun. The French government declared today that all international police officers going to the Saar to take responsibility for maintaining order would be exempt from transportation costs when passing through French territory (8th Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>Hess's Speech Indicates Franco-German Reconciliation is Possible</h3>
<p>Views of the Two Countries Have Changed</p>
<p>Hess, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Bohumer National Socialist Party and a member of the cabinet, said in a speech before thousands of people here, "The change in France's attitude towards Germany has also changed Germany's attitude towards the French question. When France sent troops to occupy the Ruhr area, we firmly believed that France wanted to destroy Germany by various means, but the Germans no longer hold this view. We now believe that Franco-German reconciliation is indeed possible. The visit of French veterans of the European War, their speeches, and the replies of veterans of other countries are all enough to prove our slogan of peace. I do not believe that war is imminent, because we Germans are dealing with the evolution of foreign policy with calmness, and the true representatives of the people in the various countries will certainly not incite war." (8th dispatch from Havas).</p>
<h3>Franco-Russian Trade Agreement Concluded</h3>
<p>(Moscow) French Minister of Commerce Marchandeau came to Russia a few days ago to study ways to develop trade between France and Russia. He had direct talks with the People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, Rozengolt, for days, and the talks were quite harmonious. It is expected that the two sides will sign a protocol tomorrow to record the agreed points. Marchandeau is scheduled to leave for Paris tonight without stopping on the way, so as to arrive on Tuesday night to chair the National Mayors Conference (8th dispatch from Havas).</p>
<p>(Moscow) French Minister of Commerce Marchandeau and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade Rozengolt are scheduled to sign a protocol tonight, stipulating that France and Russia will immediately begin negotiations to sign a Franco-Russian Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. It is rumored that in addition to economic results, Marchandeau has also consulted with the Soviet government on political aspects, and has done much to increase Franco-Russian cooperation (9th dispatch from Havas).</p>
<h3>Italy and Abyssinia Trade Accusations Over Responsibility for Conflict</h3>
<p>Italian Bombers Quell Riots</p>
<p>(London) Italy and Abyssinia are still trading accusations over responsibility for the recent conflict on the border of Italian East Africa. The Italian government has demanded a satisfactory response from the Abyssinian government, while the Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires in Italy has been ordered to lodge a strong protest, pointing out that the conflict was caused by Italian Somaliland troops under the command of Italian officers attacking Abyssinian troops of the Abyssinian Commission escorting a British official and the Asopini Commission. It is said that when the British official and the commission arrived at维鲁亚鲁亚, they encountered 800 troops under the command of an Italian officer. The Italian officer refused to allow the Asopini Commission to set up tents on the Abyssinian border and summoned tanks, aircraft, and troops from Italian territory to prevent the commission from carrying out its work. Although the British official mediated, it had no effect, and the situation deteriorated, leading to conflict. According to the British government's report, it is confirmed that the personnel dispatched by British Somaliland were indeed frightened, but the British envoy stationed in Abyssinia did not mention the details. The Asopini Commission was ordered to discuss the rights of the indigenous pastures, and from time to time passed through the border, and has nothing to do with the dispute over the territory between Italy and Abyssinia. When the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia occurred, more than 60 Italians were killed and 400 were injured. It is believed that the Abyssinian casualties must be heavy. The Abyssinian army collapsed and fled after Italian troops and bomber planes arrived to assist (8th Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>New German Cruiser Launched</h3>

<h3>Singapore Police Investigate Japanese Espionage Case</h3>
<p>Two Japanese Nationals Arrive from Europe with Suspicious Behavior</p>
<p>Nishihara Dies Suddenly While Searching for a Mysterious Leather Bag</p>
<p>London Sources Claim Involvement of Naval Personnel</p>
<p>Singapore - Singapore police authorities are currently investigating the activities of several Japanese nationals. This matter has caused alarm among the public. In recent days, the political intelligence unit of the local police station has been extremely busy, drawing close public attention. Although the authorities are being tight-lipped, it is widely believed to be related to espionage. Initially, it was suddenly reported last Thursday that Nishihara, the president of the Japanese Association of Singapore, died at the special branch office of the police station. Nishihara was summoned to the station for questioning about the whereabouts of a peculiar leather bag brought by a certain Japanese national who arrived in Singapore earlier in the week. Two minutes after Nishihara arrived at the station, he collapsed and died. An autopsy is currently underway, but the results are unknown. The full details of this case are currently unavailable. However, it is widely believed that the matter originated with two Japanese nationals who came here from Europe. One did not have a passport and claimed it was with Nishihara. It was later confirmed that it was indeed with Nishihara, but before the departure of the mail ship, a leather bag belonging to the Japanese national went missing, arousing the suspicion of the police. An investigation ensued. After the two individuals re-boarded the mail ship, Nishihara was summoned to the special branch office of the police station for further questioning. The following day, two other Japanese nationals, one a sculptor and the other the deputy editor of a Japanese newspaper in Singapore, were issued deportation orders by the authorities and placed under detention. This further alarmed the public. While the police station did not refuse to release all information, they thoroughly searched Japanese hotels and residences yesterday, interrogating many Japanese residents, but did not arrest anyone. It is reported that searches will continue at various places where Japanese residents live. The police station has not yet announced the date when the two detained Japanese nationals will be deported. It is widely believed that they will leave soon. As for Nishihara's sudden death, it will likely be thoroughly investigated within the next four days. The local Japanese residents have expressed great regret over the detention of the two nationals by the authorities. However, since the authorities have not provided a clear explanation for this action, the Japanese residents claim that they know nothing about the matter. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Singapore police are handling the activities of Japanese residents there with strict secrecy, leading to much speculation among people in London. According to reliable sources, the activities of some Japanese residents are related to espionage. It is said that some of them are naval personnel. After being interrogated by the police, they hastily returned to Japan. It is expected that some other Japanese nationals will be deported, as there is insufficient evidence to prosecute them. Some also claim that the British naval exercises to be held in Singapore will be conducted in secret due to these developments. However, this claim is not acknowledged by London political circles.

<h3>US Expands Air Force</h3>
<p>Army Adds Fifty Pursuit Planes</p>
<p>(Washington) Assistant Secretary of War Woodring announced today that the War Department has ordered fifty two-seater pursuit planes, totaling $1,996,700. The decision to begin construction immediately has been made. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Rear Admiral King, chief of the Naval Bureau of Aeronautics, suggested in his annual report today that the policy of continuing to build large airships should be maintained. He also advocated for the modernization of the USS Akron and USS Los Angeles. The report also suggested improving the bomb and torpedo loading equipment on the aircraft carriers USS Saratoga and USS Lexington. It also stated that the air force patrol was able to establish effective communication with the fleet for the first time during the Caribbean exercises in the spring. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>US Still Responsible for Philippine Defense</h3>
<p>Philippine Assembly's Defense Bill Returned by Governor-General</p>
<p>(Manila) Philippine Governor-General Murphy today returned the Philippine defense bill to the assembly for reconsideration, which is tantamount to the governor-general exercising his veto power. The accompanying note stated that the defense issue is not currently urgent, as the United States remains responsible for protecting the Philippines until the islands gain full independence. The issue of defense will be studied at leisure. However, the governor-general has already signed off on the expansion of the police force and the establishment of an air defense plan. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Manila) A US Senate investigative team, studying various economic issues and the future commercial relations between the Philippines and the United States, led by Senator Tydings, chairman of the Senate Territorial Committee, arrived in the Philippines today. Business and political leaders will try to make them understand that the economic provisions of the Philippine independence bill urgently need to be amended. This is because the bill limits the tax-free import of Philippine sugar, coconut oil, and rope into the United States, and stipulates that a progressive export tax will be levied five years after independence. Leaders from all sectors have stated that this progressive tax must be removed. As for the coconut oil tax, although it is particularly reduced for Philippine products, only five cents per pound, it is still widely criticized. Philippine leaders hope that there will be some guarantees for future US-Philippine trade. The business community supports the establishment of reciprocal relations after independence, as the United States is currently the most important market for Philippine products, and almost all sugar production is shipped to the United States. Senator Hayden came here earlier to conduct a preliminary investigation. He stated that Congress has already approved the principle of reciprocal treaties to maintain existing commercial relations, as US-Philippine trade is very beneficial to the Philippines. Political and business circles here are also aware of this and have suggested a bill to protect American products. This proposal has been endorsed by Philippine Governor-General Murphy and Senate President Quezon. However, Washington has stated that it is not appropriate to take any action because the reciprocal policy is still in its infancy. Therefore, the Tax Code Drafting Committee of the last legislature only drafted a bill to protect Philippine products and increase revenue, and did not pass the bill before the legislature adjourned on November 8. The legislature will hold a special session early next year, and the bill may be introduced at that time. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>

It will depart tomorrow for Singapore via Naples, Italy. The King and Queen have sent a letter to their third son, the Duke of Gloucester, which will be delivered by airmail. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Diet Concludes Hasty Session</h3>
<p>Dozens of Bills Passed in Fifteen Minutes</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's plenary session of the House of Representatives was like a whirlwind after a storm. Few members were present. The meeting opened at 11:15 AM, and 26 proposals and 25 petitions were collectively submitted and unanimously passed. Speaker Akita gave a speech and adjourned the meeting at 11:30 AM. (Dentsu, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The following bills submitted by the government to the extraordinary session have been passed: (1) Amendment to the City Planning Law; (2) Law on Deferment of Tax Reductions for Victims of Wind and Flood Disasters; (3) Law on Temporary Transfer of Government-Owned Uncultivated Land; (4) Amendment to Law No. 5 of Showa 9; Budget Bills: (5) Supplementary General Budget for Revenues and Expenditures for the Ninth Fiscal Year; (6) Supplementary Budget for Special Account Expenditures for the Ninth Fiscal Year. The above bills will be deliberated at the regular cabinet meeting on the 11th and promulgated on the same day. (Dentsu, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers meeting of the 66th Extraordinary Session opened at 10:15 AM on the morning of the 9th to deliberate on the disaster relief budget. Prime Minister Okada and all other cabinet members attended, and almost all the seats for members were occupied. Chairman Yanagisawa of the Budget Committee first reported on the process and results of the committee, and then questioning began. First, Sakatani Yoshio took the floor and said that the problem of reforming the institutions stationed in Manchuria should be addressed reasonably in light of past actual circumstances. However, Japan and "Manchukuo" should avoid disputes over the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) in the future. It has always been stipulated that no one except China and Japan is allowed to own SMR shares. Japan and Manchukuo have the same interests. In the future, "Manchukuo" should be allowed to own SMR shares. Is the government paying attention to this point?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied that the government is currently considering the issue of "Manchukuo" owning SMR shares in the SMR Ordinance and it is open to consideration. Sakatani urged the government to implement the revision of the ordinance as soon as possible. Then, after beginning the discussion, Maeda Toshisada criticized the government for convening the extraordinary session too late, saying that the civil engineering expenses in the disaster budget are extremely small. He hoped that the government would study more thorough disaster relief measures in the future. Although the contents of this budget are not satisfactory, he supported its passage through the Diet because of the urgency of the relief effort.</p>
<p>As a result of the Speaker's vote, it passed, and the government's disaster budget was completely established. The meeting adjourned at 11:50 AM. (Japan United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The extraordinary session of the Diet convened for the first time by the Okada cabinet has concluded. Although its purpose was to deliberate on the disaster budget, each political party concentrated its attack on the government's rigorous criticism of the implementation of the budget. The government authorities tried their best to defend it, extending the session and passing the disaster budget of 210 million yen, deciding on the exemption of taxes for disaster victims, the government's temporary transfer of rice plan, and reforming important issues such as the institutions stationed in Manchuria. Although the Diet session was not long, the importance of its passage of each bill is quite remarkable. (Japan United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives experienced repeated turbulence and extended the session twice, passing the government budget bill and delivering it to the House of Peers. On the 8th, the House of Peers committee decided to pass it to the formal meeting on the 9th. The government's deficit bond bill, the law on temporary transfer of government-owned rice to disaster areas, the amendment to the city planning law, and the four proposals to exempt victims of wind and flood disasters from taxes have been passed by both houses. If the budget bill on the 9th can be successfully passed, then the extraordinary session can be concluded. The government side considered that the Okada cabinet's first Diet session was dangerous because its answers were inconsistent. However, it was successful in extending the session and passing all the proposals peacefully. However, the Seiyukai, which advocated the revival of party politics and the return of constitutional politics, teamed up with the Minseito, but unexpectedly submitted a bombshell motion in the Diet. It was unable to maintain it and succumbed to the weak cabinet, exposing its weakness. Not only did its first step in reviving party politics completely fail, but also the credibility and power of the party fell to the ground, which is truly regrettable for parliamentary politics. (Japan United Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>US Also Implements Drug Prohibition</h3>
<p>Eight Overseas Chinese Arrested</p>
<p>(Washington) The government's campaign to eradicate thugs and gangsters has achieved another success. Treasury Department secret agents were ordered to arrest drug traffickers, and simultaneous actions were taken nationwide. More than 500 people have been arrested, and countless drugs have been seized. The government is determined to eradicate organized gangs and believes that to achieve this goal, drug trafficking must be eliminated first. During the arrests in Baltimore, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau personally directed the operation, demonstrating the government's seriousness. After the arrests, Mr. Anslinger, head of the Treasury Department's Bureau of Narcotics, conducted detailed inquiries. Mr. Anslinger said, "The results of the inquiries are very satisfactory. Even if this arrest does not completely eradicate drug traffickers, it will at least make the leaders in this business think deeply." Among the arrested drug traffickers were eight overseas Chinese, allegedly seized for opium. It is estimated that the final number of arrests will reach 1,000. It is also worth noting that the National Crime Conference will soon be held in Washington. At that time, federal and state agents will design the best way to jointly eradicate thugs and gangsters, and this large-scale arrest of drug offenders took place just before the conference.

<h3>Bolivia Mobilizes Nationally</h3>
<p>Preparing for a Decisive Battle with Paraguayan Forces</p>
<p>La Paz - The Bolivian cabinet has ordered a national mobilization to prevent the complete defeat of the army. The mobilization will be implemented on Sunday or Monday. This mobilization includes all reservists and is the most widespread mobilization order since the outbreak of war one and a half years ago. The cabinet is now determined to repel the Paraguayan army and has been working closely with military leaders to ensure that the front-line troops have the full support of the nation. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>According to official reports from Asuncion, the capital of Argentina, the right wing of the Paraguayan army launched a surprise attack, and seven divisions of the Bolivian army have been completely disintegrated. General Estigarribia also stated that after several days of bloody fighting, his troops have occupied Villa Montes, the gateway to the Bermejo oil region, and the forts of Picuiba, Longvesta, and Irondha have also fallen.

<h3>Pacific Defense and Naval Arms Race</h3>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Discusses Trends After Failure of Naval Conference</p>
<p>The Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun reported on the 2nd that the failure of the London Naval Conference and Japan's abandonment of the Washington Treaty are already established facts. Britain and the United States blamed Japan for the failure, and the United States insisted on a 5:5:3 ratio, threatening to compete in shipbuilding. The following is an analysis of the impact of expanded defense preparations in the Pacific after the breakdown of the conference. The Washington Treaty stipulated: (1) islands in the Pacific currently held by the United States and those to be acquired in the future (excluding islands near Alaska and the Panama Canal Zone, and the Hawaiian Islands); (2) territories in the Pacific east of 110 degrees east longitude currently held by Britain and those to be acquired in the future (excluding islands near Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, and New Zealand); (3) island territories and dependencies in the Pacific of Japan (i.e., the Kuril Islands, Ogasawara Islands, Amami Ōshima, Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, Penghu Islands, and islands territories and dependencies that Japan may acquire in the Pacific in the future (stipulating that the status quo of defense facilities be maintained). However, these defense restrictions are actually centered on Japan and are limited to the defense of the Western Pacific, not involving the Eastern or Southern Pacific. After the treaty is abandoned, the defense restrictions will naturally be lifted. At that time, there will be opportunities to attack Japan, reducing Japan's defensive capabilities. On the other hand, Japan can also prepare for defense far from the islands. This is why Japan had no choice but to abandon the treaty. However, once the treaty is abandoned, what follows is an arms race. In other words, during the treaty's validity period, it should be strictly observed until the end of 1936. After the treaty is abandoned, each country can build ships at will. However, with today's industrial capacity, it takes four years for a battleship, three years for a 10,000-ton cruiser, and less than a year for a destroyer, regardless of the country. However, even if countries want to compete in shipbuilding, their national strength is limited, and it remains questionable whether they can actually do so. For example, the United States has been experiencing a severe domestic panic since 1929. The total income of the American people was 85 billion yuan before the war, but today it is only 35 billion yuan. The national debt of the central government and the states totals 48 billion yuan, and overseas investments amount to 30 billion yuan. Now, if the United States wants to establish the world's leading navy, all of its expenses are paid from civil engineering funds in the name of unemployment relief, so the deficit public debt is increasing, and the fiscal situation is becoming tight. Therefore, the US Congress cannot achieve the goal of becoming the world's leading naval power in accordance with the domestic situation with the ship-building expenses that are agreed upon. The same is true for the UK. In addition, the training of naval officers requires at least ten years per person, non-commissioned officers require six years, and other aviation soldiers require more than five years of training. However, the US and UK have always adopted a mercenary system and a voluntary military system. The United States has not yet reformed its military system, so it feels a particular lack of personnel. Judging from the current situation of shipbuilding in various countries, if the existing treaty continues until after 1936, the United States will have an aircraft carrier of 30,000 tons, a cruiser of 60,000 tons, a destroyer of 70,000 tons, and a submarine of more than 20,000 tons, totaling more than 190,000 tons, which is still less than the treaty's limit of more than 520,000 tons. Now, to supplement the construction, the annual construction volume must be 80,000 tons. By the end of 1936, the UK would still be less than 100,000 tons of the treaty amount. Such a large shipbuilding plan is unlikely to be implemented. Moreover, if the United States implements a three-year plan and a five-year plan for shipbuilding today, it would have to build two new ships every month until the end of 1939, for a total of 139 ships, which would be even more difficult. In summary, the so-called arms race is just speculative talk and is still extremely difficult in reality.</p>
<h3>Saar Impressions</h3>
<p>(National News Agency German Correspondent) Qiao Qisen, a graduate of the University of Berlin, traveled to the Saar and gained many impressions. He has returned to Germany and made the following remarks to reporters. This winter, the most difficult political problem in Europe to solve is the Saar problem. By January 13 next year, the people of the Saar must vote to decide whether to belong to Germany, France, or remain in the status quo. This is an event that all European countries are paying attention to. In all fairness, the Saar should originally belong to Germany. Not only is the language of the residents the same as German, but also the culture and life are no different. Therefore, the people of the Saar all want to return to Germany. The public opinion of the Saar is inclined to Germany, and there should be no other problems. But doesn't the fact that the Saar problem arises is because it is caused by European politics?</p>
<p>From this point of view, it is clear that the people of the Saar are inclined to Germany and all want to be Hitler's comrades. This is enough to prove that Hitler's policy of friendship and peace abroad is different from the hypocritical high-pressure tactics of other countries. During my trip to the Saar, it was the day when the new German government was just established, the national flag was restored, and Hitler's election was won. When I arrived in Saarbrucken and Saar Louis, I saw many National Socialist flags and black, white, and red German national flags hanging in those two places. According to what I heard, only French agencies in the Saar hang the black, white, and blue French flag. The people of the Saar hang the German flag as a symbol of the residents' sympathy for Hitler. This kind of sympathy will probably not be lost until the vote next year. Within a country, the current government of that country did not encourage the people to hang the flag of a certain country, but the people automatically hang the German flag. This is enough to show the future will of the people of that country, which no one can stop. Those who are good at observing things should value the will of the people. Today, the people of the Saar all want to be Hitler's comrades. This truly shows the people there have a fanatical infatuation, which is even more intense than that of the people in Berlin. Berlin also hangs party flags and national flags every Friday under the same circumstances.</p>
<p>During this trip, I first met a Saar woman at Mainz Station. At that time, I was waiting for a train at the station. The woman was very simple. She took a step towards a German woman and came to the platform to ask me, "Are you also going to Saarbrucken?" I gladly agreed, so this Saar woman generously told me about the situation in the Saar, because her son was studying at Mainz School and this trip was to take her son home. I gained another political understanding from this. She said, "I am originally the mother of a German child, so I don't want my children to study in France. The people of the Saar all want to belong to Germany. I am a farmer's wife, and especially we farmers are more inclined to Germany. We always want to abandon our homes and go to our German homeland, because we have no country in our home, as if we are stateless. We are German migrants. The living standards in the Saar are even higher than in Germany. We know very well that if we return to our homeland, the economic situation will be even more difficult, but we are not afraid to sacrifice for the country. As for the farmers in Rottlin, their situation is even worse, several times worse than ours, and they can only make ends meet, but they have been lacking clothes for a long time. When we go out and look at people, we see the French people's gorgeous clothes and the German people's clean and simple clothes."</p>
<p>When the train arrived in the Saar, I said goodbye to this Saar farmer and thanked her for telling me about the situation in the Saar. The border between Germany and the Saar is the Namborn station. After the end of the European War and the signing of the treaty, the Saar belonged to the French customs zone, so France set up a customs inspection office there. After I waited for the customs inspection to be released, I went to the station to buy food, but the French tax officer called to me in French, "Please don't go, wait on the train." I deliberately replied in German, "I'm going to buy food," and wanted to see if German could not be used in Germany.</p>
<p>Saarbrucken is the capital of the Saar, and I looked up and saw many bright and dazzling German flags.</p>
<p>After I passed the customs, I immediately paid attention to French shoes. I went to four shoe stores to inquire, but all I saw were German shoes, and the prices were higher than in Berlin. I was very surprised at the time, how could there be no French shoes for sale in the French territory, and the import tariff on French goods is free, and the price should be cheaper than German. While I was hesitating, the female shop assistant explained to me that although French shoes are cheap, the people of the Saar do not want to buy them. When asked why, she replied that German shoes are national shame souvenirs and are made by our compatriots, so the workmanship and materials must be more refined. From this, it can be inferred that German goods still dominate the Saar market.</p>
<p>Secondly, I saw the people of the Saar coming and going on the street, all with a very special German style.</p>
<p>On the street, I saw many newspaper sellers and asked which newspaper was the most popular. One of the female newspaper sellers replied, "The Saarbrücken People's Newspaper and the Evening News" are the most popular. These two newspapers have large characters printed at the top of the newspaper, titled "Organ of the German Vanguard." The German Vanguard has a non-partisan stance and is purely dedicated to the construction of national society, leading the way in saving modern Germany. As for the Evening News, it also has a clear slogan on the front page, "For Germany, Resist the Enemies of Germany." These phrases are no different from what people in Germany are saying today. - So I continued to ask, "Do you have any French newspapers?" The female newspaper seller replied, "This goes without saying." At this point, I said goodbye. After this, wherever I went in the Saar, I discovered that the nature and character of the people of the Saar were exactly the same as those of Germany, and the people of the Saar had no other wish but to hope to be reunited with Germany.</p>

<p>The Central Antiquities Preservation Committee Sends a Telegram to All Central Ministries and Councils, the Peiping Military and Political Branch Council, All Provincial and Municipal Governments, All Pacification Commissioners, All Universities, and All Academic Organizations: Since recent years, the government's organizations for preserving national antiquities have not been unified, leading to the erosion and collapse of steles and buildings, the outflow of bronze vessels, books, and documents overseas, free excavation, and unscrupulous merchants cleverly seizing profits and destroying national treasures, which is extremely distressing. For the sake of unified preservation, the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee has been established, and Li Ji, Ye Gongchuo, Huang Wenbi, Fu Sinian, Zhu Xizu, Jiang Fuchong, Dong Zuobin, Teng Gu, Shu Chushi, Fu Rulin, Lu Xirong, Ma Heng, Xu Bingchang, etc., have been appointed as committee members by the Executive Yuan, and Fu Rulin, Teng Gu, Li Ji, Ye Gongchuo, and Jiang Fuchong have been designated as standing committee members, with Fu Rulin as chairman. The inaugural meeting was held at the Executive Yuan on July 12th of this year. Subsequently, a copper seal was issued by the National Government, inscribed with "Seal of the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee," and a small copper stamp, inscribed with "Central Antiquities Preservation Committee," was put into use immediately. The rear courtyard of the Ministry of Interior was selected as the committee's address and reported accordingly. It is noted that this committee, in accordance with the provisions of the Central Antiquities Preservation Law, is the legally competent authority for the preservation of historical sites and antiquities throughout the country. Hereafter, all matters concerning the preservation of historical sites and antiquities throughout the country shall be carried out by this committee in accordance with the Antiquities Preservation Law and its implementing regulations, item by item. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) To supervise and improve the completeness and improvement of the preservation methods of legally established preservation organizations; (2) To cooperate with local governments to protect and repair historical sites and antiquities not yet under government preservation; (3) To approve or reject applications for excavation from academic institutions and provide appropriate assistance and supervision; (4) To severely punish private excavations by unscrupulous merchants and local ruffians; (5) To protect antiquities in private collections by conducting detailed investigations and registrations of important items; (6) To determine the preservation organization for newly discovered antiquities in various localities after the committee assesses their value; (7) To hold local governments responsible for the protection of local historical sites and antiquities; (8) For antiquities related to academic culture, to allocate them to central cultural and academic institutions for research; (9) To register and properly plan preservation methods for other discovered antiquities and historical sites; (10) To strictly supervise the excavation of undiscovered antiquities. The above ten points are the outline of this committee's work. However, the preservation of antiquities is of utmost importance and is closely related to research in history and academics and improvements in art and industry. All members of this committee will work diligently, fearing that they may not be up to the task. It is hoped that all ministries and councils, provincial and municipal governments, military organizations, universities, and public and private academic organizations will thoroughly implement the Antiquities Preservation Law and its implementing regulations promulgated by the central government. If there are those with specialized research on antiquities preservation methods, those who carefully examine antiquities, or those who have definite identification, it is hoped that all will express their great opinions and jointly assist in this grand undertaking, so as to benefit cultural revival, provide a basis for the spirit of history, promote national consciousness, and enhance the beautification of education, so as not to fail the government's intention to specially establish the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee. Now, we specially send one copy each of the Central Antiquities Preservation Law, the Implementing Regulations of the Antiquities Preservation Law, and the Organizational Regulations of the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee for your perusal. Respectfully, Fu Rulin, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee; Standing Committee Members Teng Gu, Li Ji, Ye Gongchuo, Jiang Fuchong, bowing in unison.</p>
<h3>Italy to Rescue the Bank</h3>
<p>The Roman Cabinet Approved a Case Today Stipulating That the Italian People Must Notify the Italian Bank of the Amount of All Investments in Foreign Bonds or Italian Bonds Issued Abroad Before December 31. Failure to Comply with the Order Will Result in a Fine Equal to the Amount of the Unreported Bonds and May Be Sentenced to Imprisonment. All Banks, Bankers, and Businesses Must Submit Foreign Loans to the National Foreign Exchange Administration, Which Will Purchase Them at the Current Exchange Rate. No Official Reason Has Been Published as to Why the Government Passed This Case. However, Domestic and Foreign Banking Circles Are Not Surprised by This. They Said That the Case Is Clearly to Rescue the Recent Losses Suffered by the Italian Bank Because the Bank's Cash Reserve Has Fallen Below the Legal 40% (National Telegram on the 8th).</p>

<h3>Full Text of Guo Taiqi's Speech at the 15th Session of the League of Nations General Assembly (Continued from the 8th)</h3>
<p>Statement on China's Position on the Northeast Issue</p>
<p>When the League of Nations General Assembly Passed Its Report Eighteen Months Ago, the Lytton Commission of Inquiry Had Already Submitted a Report with the Results of Its Investigation to the General Assembly, Detailing the Tragic Situation Caused by the Japanese Military Invasion, Ending with the Statement, "Manchuria Has Been in Turmoil in the Past Year, and the People of This Vast and Fertile Land Have Experienced a Situation and Suffering Almost Unprecedented." Today's Situation Has Deteriorated Further, as Can Be Proven by Independent and Irreproachable News. On August 23, the London Times Published a Message from Its Shenyang Correspondent Stating, "Since August 6, Bandits Have Attacked an Average of Twice a Day. The Newspapers of 'Manchukuo' Also Publish a Table Today Listing 31 Bridges Destroyed, 31 Train Derailments, and 91 Station Attacks Along the Eastern Section of the Central-Cambodian Railway. According to News Obtained by Foreigners Here, the Danger of Foreigners Being Attacked by Bandits Is Increasing Day by Day When Traveling Outside the Trunk Lines." The Next Day, August 24, the Times Also Published a Maritime Electric Message Stating, "Many Announcements Regarding 'Manchukuo' Are Often Preceded by Statements That Public Security and Order Have Now Been Restored. Such Familiar Words Are Difficult to Believe Based on the Bandit Police News Obtained in a Single Day. On Saturday, Thirty-Six Koreans Residing in a Village Northwest of Shahezi Were Massacred by Bandits Near Beiling in Shenyang, Killing Thirty-Three. On Wednesday, Three Japanese Workers Were Killed by Bandits on the Jitu Railway. On Tuesday, A Train of Armored Vehicles Traveling on the Eastern Section of the Northern Manchuria Railway Was Attacked by Bandits After the Locomotive and Four Train Cars Derailed." The Tragedies Cited Above All Occurred on the Trunk Lines, and the Situation in the Rest of Manchuria Can Be Imagined. Recently, the Residence of the Pseudo-Emperor in the So-Called Capital Was Also Burned Down, and One of the Largest Japanese Airfields Outside the So-Called Capital Was Burned to the Ground for the Second Time in April, with Losses Reaching Millions of Dollars. All of This Is Sufficient to Show That the Scattered War Is Large in Scale and Is Referred to as "Bandits" for the Convenience of Spreading Evil Plans. Of Course, There Are Lawless Elements in Manchuria Who Make a Living as Bandits, but in Terms of Burning Down Palaces and Airfields, Destroying Railways, and Attacking Troops and Troop Trains, It Is Actually a Major Illegal Movement of the Oppressed People Resisting the Army. These People Persist in Their Doctrine and Are Not Discouraged, So They Fight Anytime and Anywhere, and When the Opportunity Arrives, They Will Launch a Final Liberation. The Situation in Manchuria Today Is Roughly the Same as When the September 18 Incident Occurred, That Is, the Japanese Army Is Still Occupying Major Cities and Sending Troops to Punish Residents at All Times to Show Their Might. Under the Occupation of Foreign Troops, There Is a Possibility of Restoring Law and Order and Allowing People to Achieve Prosperity. This Kind of Ideal Has Been Dispelled by Facts and Actually Despises the Lessons of History. The Reaction to the Destruction of Treaties and the Occupation of Our Country's Northeastern Provinces Is Not Limited to the Far East. All European Countries That Care About Their National Borders or National Security Have Been Harmed Because the Countries of the League of Nations and China Are Still Unable to Do Anything, or Have Done Something, but Are Too Cowardly to Support the Decisions Announced by the League of Nations. The Spreading Consequences Are Not Purely Negative. The Soviet Union's Accession to the League of Nations and the Closer Cooperation Between the League of Nations and the United States Can Be Said to Be at Least Partly Due to the Urgency of the Far East Incident. Furthermore, the Far East Is Becoming Increasingly Important in World Affairs and Has Now Received More Vivid and Broader Recognition. It May Be an Overstatement to Say That the Center of Gravity of World Politics Has Shifted from Europe to the Far East, but It Is Indeed a Sad Fact That the Pacific Ocean Is Gradually Becoming the Center of World Affairs. Unfortunately, the Continued Military Occupation of Our Country's Northeastern Provinces Has Become the Most Urgent Danger of the Second World War in Today's World. There Is Absolutely No Doubt About This. The Danger of War in the Far East Is Closely and Inseparably Related to the Future of Peace in Europe, and This Is Also Becoming Increasingly Clear.</p>
<p>The Chinese Representative at the World Economic Conference Once Asked Everyone to Pay Attention to the Potential of the Chinese Market and the Grand Program of National Reconstruction That the Chinese Government Has Implemented Through the Technical Cooperation of the League of Nations. This Program, as You Can See in the Report of the League of Nations Technical Experts, "Includes Various Aspects of National Reconstruction, Such as the Construction of Roads, the Improvement of Silk, Tea, and Cotton, and Cultural Education and Health. Currently, There Are Only a Few League of Nations Experts in China Who Are Specializing in Investigation and Making Technical Designs That Are Completely Unrelated to Political Disputes. The Government Is Currently Carrying Out the Development of Sky and Railway Transportation, and the Strict Movement to Reject Drugs, and Other Reconstruction Undertakings, Although Not Receiving the Technical Cooperation of the League of Nations, Are All Within the Scope of the Overall National Reconstruction Plan. As for What Methods Are Used to Seek the Most Beneficial Results from This Kind of Work, This Is Clearly a Matter of Purely Internal Policy, Which Should Be Decided and Implemented by Sovereign China. Other Countries Have No Reason or Any Right to Interfere in This Kind of Policy. China Is Comforted by the Fact That China's Position on This Matter Has Been Fully Supported by All Countries Concerned with the Policy of East-West Cooperation, as Can Be Proved by the Actions Taken by the Powers After the Tokyo Declaration Was Issued in April. The Chinese Government Is Still Engaged in Struggle to Resist Major Difficulties, and the Work to Be Established Is Also Very Arduous, but We Now Feel That We Have Gained a Foothold and Are Moving Forward in the Right Direction. Given Time, We Will Surely Succeed. If International Peace Can Be Maintained, China's Progress Will Be Solid and Rapid.</p>
<p>I Have Now Strived to Be Concise and, in the Spirit of Plain Realism, Have Stated to You the Prominent Points That the Chinese Government Considers to Be Related to the World Situation, the Far East Issue, and the Purpose of the League of Nations. China Regards Itself as the Vanguard of the League of Nations and the Entire Plan of East-West Cooperation. This Kind of Feeling Has Been Strengthened by the Situation That We Do Not Wish to Have but Makes Us the Main Victim, Because China Has Become the Only Representative of the Far East in the League of Nations Executive Council in the Past Eighteen Months. We Are Willing to Consolidate All Our Chains with the League of Nations in the Technical and Political Scope to Resist the Pressure Exerted by Those Who Will Force Us to Turn Our Backs to the West and Force Us to Join a Purely Unequal Combination in the Name of "Asia for Asians." We Do Not Believe That the World Should Be Divided Into Several Impermeable Parts According to Continents and Races. We Firmly Believe That Peace Can Only Be Maintained Through the League of Nations. The League of Nations Is Universal, and Its Organization Is Not Divided by Major Geographical Regions of the World, So It Can Stand on an Unshakable Position. The Chinese People Have Always Trusted International Justice, Which Is Why, Despite Experiencing All Kinds of Disappointments and Setbacks, Their Loyalty to the League of Nations Has Not Diminished Slightly, and They Are Determined to Exert All Their Powers to Support the League of Nations Covenant and Adhere to the Path of Peace.</p>
<p>I Will Now Make a Conclusion to Strengthen the Power of the League of Nations and Show Future Hopes. China Is the Foundation of Asia. If So, Then Russia Should Be the Arch of the Union of Europe and Asia. China Eagerly Welcomes Russia's Hope to Join the League of Nations Immediately. Russia's Hard Work in the Disarmament Conference Is a Good Sign of the Power It Will Occupy When It Joins the League of Nations. Russia Has Contributed the Most Explicit Definition of Aggressors. China and Russia Have Always Been Neighbors, and the Distance of Their Border Lines Is the Crown of Europe and Asia. We Have a Common Relationship in Maintaining Peace in the Far East and the Pacific Ocean. From Now On, We Are Extremely Happy That Our Joint Efforts to Manage Peace Can Be Carried Out Within the League of Nations Organization. (End)</p>

<h3>Huang Fu Expresses Willingness to Take on the New Position of Minister of Interior</h3>
<p>Huang Fu Cables the Central Government and Will Travel to the Capital Soon</p>
<p>Wartime Zone Cleanup Work to Be Implemented</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Reorganization Committee, Suffered from Anemia in the Middle of Last Month. After Treatment by Chinese and Western Doctors, He Has Now Recovered. Huang Fu Has Agreed to Concurrently Serve as Minister of Interior, but the Time He Will Travel to the Capital Is Still Undecided. Huang Fu's Attitude Toward Concurrently Serving as Minister of Interior and the Current Status of the Political Reorganization Committee's Work Are Described in Detail Below:</p>
<p>The Morning After the Executive Yuan's Decision to Appoint Huang Fu Concurrently as Minister of Interior Reached Peiping, Huang Fu Issued a Written Statement to Visitors in the Evening, Expressing That the North and South Are Remotely Separated and Difficult to Take Care Of Simultaneously, and Said That Northern Political Affairs Are Being Gradually Promoted. On That Day, Huang Fu Received a Telegram from President Wang, In Addition to Asking About Huang Fu's Illness, He Also Told Him That the Central Government Had Great Expectations and Asked Him Not to Humbly Refuse the Position of Minister of Interior and Hoped That He Would Immediately Travel to the Capital to Take Office. Huang Fu Then Replied by Telegram on the Evening of the (7th), First Stating That His Illness Had Recovered, Then Expressing His Gratitude for the Central Government's Favors, and Finally Stating That There Were Hundreds of Matters to Be Dealt With Here in Political Affairs, and Each Part That Had Been Promoted Needed to Be Personally Presided Over. Once Everything Was Sorted Out, He Would Travel to the Capital Soon to Receive Guidance, Etc. Therefore, Although the Date of Huang Fu's Trip South Has Not Yet Been Determined, He Has Agreed to Take on the New Position of Minister of Interior. As for Huang Fu's Illness, After Diagnosis by Chinese and Western Doctors, It Was Considered to Be Anemia. The Left Arm Could Not Be Extended, and the Brain Nerves Also Felt Twinges From Time to Time. After More Than Ten Days of Diagnosis and Treatment, Chinese Medicine Used Moxibustion, and Western Medicine Used Electrical Treatment. Until Today (the 8th), the Left Arm Has Been Able to Extend Freely, and the Headaches Have Also Stopped. Today (the 8th), Huang Fu Went Downstairs to Inspect Various Places and Met with Yu Xuezhong in the Afternoon.</p>
<p>The Most Recent Work of the Political Reorganization Committee Concerning Internal Affairs Is Currently Handling the Examination Matters of the Training Institute for Local Administrative Personnel and the Training Institute for Rural Enterprise Talents, and Classes Can Be Started Soon. Regarding the Wartime Zone Cleanup Issue, the Wartime Zone Cleanup Committee Is Being Ordered to Work Hard to Proceed. The Preparation Procedures of Our Side for the Wartime Zone Cleanup Work Have Been Completed, and the Implementation Steps Will First Be Handled by the Commissioners of the Chan-Yu-Ji-Mi Two Regions Separately, but There Are Many Items and They Need to Be Done Step by Step (the 8th).</p>
<h3>Jinan Japanese Pawnshops Are Depressed</h3>
<p>- Opening Night Pawnshop to Reduce Interest -</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since Wang San, Japanese pawnshops have sprung up, Exploiting Heavily, and the Poor Have Had No Choice but to Be Oppressed in Order to Seek Relief. According to Statistics, the Capital of Japanese Pawnshops Has Reached One Million Yuan. The Provincial Government Began to Establish Yulu Pawnshops the Year Before Last, and Now Business Is Extremely Developed. On the 2nd of This Month, Yulu Branch Pawnshops Were Also Established in the Commercial Port, with a Term of 12 Months, an Interest Rate of 2%, and a Storage Fee of 0.5%, So Japanese Pawnshops Have Gradually Been Affected, and They Have Tried to Change Their Previous Methods. Starting Yesterday (the 5th), the Term Will Be Six Months, the Monthly Interest Rate for Those with 20 Yuan Is 5%, the Monthly Interest Rate for Those with Less Than 50 Yuan Is 4%, and the Monthly Interest Rate for Those with More Than 50 Yuan Is 3%. Also, Considering the Psychology of Those Who Pawn Items, Most People Do Not Want to Be Seen by Others, So Night Pawnshops Are Being Planned Again, and Pawning and Redemption Can Also Be Done at Night, Which Can Be Said to Be Good at Speculation.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Private Shipping Industry's Appeal Amidst the Sound of Longqing Intermodal Transport</h3>
<p>If Intermodal Transport Is Implemented, Freight Transport Will Be Taken Away</p>
<p>Please Ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Plead with the Municipal Government for Relief</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Maritime Transportation Between Qingdao and Haizhou, Shijiusuo, and Other Places Has Always Been Carried Out by More Than Ten Private Shipping Companies in This City, Such as Xiaogang Changji Line, Which Navigate Back and Forth and Carry Goods, and Business Is Still Considered to Be Developed. A Total of More Than 30 Small Vessels Navigate the Small Wheel of Haizhou Shijiusuo Xiangshui Kou. In Order to Implement Cooperation, the Industry Has Also Formed a Xiaogang Joint Office to Seek Common Interests. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Is Now Cooperating with the Longhai Railway to Handle Water and Land Intermodal Transport. The Intermodal Transport Route Between Shanghai, Qingdao, and Lianyungang Has Been Added and Officially Started on the 5th of This Month. After This Is Implemented, Almost All the Freight Transport of the Private Shipping Industry in the Xiaogang Area Will Be Taken Away. The Industry Is Greatly Panicked and Specially Convened an Emergency Meeting of Various Private Shipping Companies the Day Before Yesterday. It Was Decided to Submit a Request to the Shipping Association to Quickly Find a Way to Maintain It. The Shipping Association Submitted the Request, Saying That the Matter Is of Great Importance to the Future of Private Shipping and Specially Sent a Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Request the Municipal Government for Assistance and Relief. The Original Letter Is Recorded as Follows: "A Request to Plead for a Way to Maintain It in Order to Save the Shipping Merchants from the Emergency. It Is Secretly Based on the Joint Name of More Than Ten Businesses, Such As Changji Line, Tongfuchang, and Yutai Line, Members of Our Association, Who Claim That the Businesses Have Been Operating the Wheelboat Business Between Xiaogang, Qingdao, and Haizhou Along the Coast for Several Years. During This Period, Affected by the World's Economic Depression and Business Recession, Water Power Has Fallen Miserably and Business Has Been Depressed. Therefore, Years of Losses Have Been Hard to Say. This Winter's Freight Transport Has Improved Slightly, and I Am Fortunate to Have the Opportunity to Make Up for It. However, the State-Owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Does Not Care About the Hardships of Private Wheelboats and Has Undertaken the Intermodal Transport of Longqing. I Heard That the Preparations Have Been Completed and Implementation Is Imminent. Its Organizational Scale Is Large, Its Situation Is Superior, and All Expenses Have Been Given Preferential Treatment by the Government. It Is Difficult for Private Wheelboats to Compete with It. In the Future, All Freight Transport Between Haizhou and Xiaogang Will Be Absorbed. Moreover, the Largest Wheelboat in Xiaogang Is Only About 500 Tons, and the Smallest Is Only 50 or 60 Tons. In Addition to Navigating Between Haizhou and Qingdao, There Is No Other Route That Can Be Changed. It Is Different from the Wheelboats That Navigate Between Haizhou and Shanghai. It Has No Competitive Power and Can Only Sit and Wait for Death. The Maritime Administration Once Had an Order to Limit the Addition of Ships on Each Route in Order to Maintain the Shipping Industry, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Did Not Use All Its Strength to Compete with Foreign Merchants to Recover Lost Interests. It Only Engaged in Destroying the Private Shipping Industry and Was Determined to Put Them to Death and Then Quickly. It Lost the Original Intention of Our Government to Protect the Shipping Industry. It Can Be Seen That More Than 30 Small Wheelboats Are All Placed in Useless Places, and More Than 3,000 Seamen Have Lost Their Way to Make a Living. It Is Also a Plan That Is Abandoned Due to Improper Gains and Losses. In Short, the Intermodal Transport Business Is Convenient for National Economy and People's Livelihood, but the Existing Wheelboats Have Been Serving the Society for a Long Time, and There Are No Achievements to Speak Of. Slight Labor Is Worth Recording. If Intermodal Transport Is Carried Out Suddenly, the Livelihood of the Existing Wheelboats Should Also Be Taken Care Of. We Should Plan for Relief Measures Before We Can Proceed Smoothly and Avoid Involving the Destruction Stage. We Can Either Invest in Buying Up Each Wheelboat, or Lease It at a Reasonable Price, or Allow Them to Join the Intermodal Transport to Serve Together. We Hope That the Public and Private Sectors Will Be Consistent and Maintain Each Other. Otherwise, at the Critical Moment of Survival, It Is Inevitable to Compete to the Death, Resulting in No End. I Think the Government Cannot Bear to See This Situation and Does Not Plan for a Solution for the Businesses' Survival and for the Future of the Private Shipping Industry. I Only Have to Ask Your Association to Quickly Find a Way to Maintain It to Relieve the Difficulties. I Can't Say How Much I Hope So. According to This, the Existing Wheelboats Sailing Between Qingdao and Haizhou Rely on This Line as a Way of Management. In the Past, They Have Served the Society and Have Achieved Some Success. If the Intermodal Transport of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Is Implemented, the Scope Will Be Wide and the Strength Will Be Great. The Business Will Naturally Be Incomparable to the Existing Wheelboats in the Future. If We Do Not Seek Appropriate Relief Measures for the Private Shipping Industry, It Will Be Impossible to Survive, Which Is No Different from Adding to Its Destruction. The Grievances It Holds Are a Definite Fact. In This Autumn of Economic Decline, Regardless of Whether It Is State-Owned or Privately Owned, They Should All Be Maintained Uniformly. The Future of the Country Will Benefit. The Difficulties and Difficulties of the Members Have Been Discussed at the General Assembly, and It Has Been Decided That the Matter Is Related to the Danger of Shipping and We Have to Plead With Your Association to Plead With the Municipal Government to Understand the Situation and Provide Assistance and Relief to Relieve the Difficulties. I Am Grateful for Your Kindness. I Am Respectfully Submitting It to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce," (the 8th).</p>

<h3>Discovery of Bandits in Yangcheng Lake</h3>
<p>Zhou Weilie, the district chief of the Second Water Police District, and Yin Suichou, the former chief of the Tenth Autonomous District of Wu County, sent an urgent telegram stating that bandits had been discovered in Cheng Lake, intending to cause unrest. Chief Zhou immediately arranged a meeting with the Zhejiang Seventh Water Police Team and ordered all subordinate teams, including the Seventh, Eighth, Fifth, and Special Task Teams, as well as the war junks "Peirong," "Baosu," and "Anjing," to encircle and suppress the lake bandits in nine routes. After starting mobilization on the 7th, the commander of the Seventh Team of the Third Route, Xu Boying, led dozens of water police officers on a motorized sampan, from Zhangyadang Beiku to Sanbaitang. Six bandit boats were spotted, three of which escaped upon hearing the alarm. The remaining three were engaged by Commander Xu and his team, who opened fire and suppressed them, forcing the bandits to flee. As a result, one bandit boat and six bandits, including Wang A'si, Wang A'da, and Chen Guangfu, were captured. They are scheduled to be sent to the Suzhou District Office today (the 9th) for investigation.</p>

<h3>Appeal for Exemption of Business Tax for Merchants</h3>
<p>The local county chamber of commerce recently received a notice from the Business Tax Bureau to various guilds of rice, beans, miscellaneous grains, and mountain products, instructing all brokers to collect business tax from merchants on their behalf. Since brokers pay license fees and operate by acting as agents for buyers and sellers, they already pay brokerage tax and business tax, which feels like an unnecessary burden. Collecting business tax on behalf of merchants would essentially turn rice shops into a disguised likin station, still taxing goods. This would inevitably deter merchants from coming. Moreover, the Second National Financial Conference this year, in reviewing local financial reforms, generally agreed that commissioned collection and proxy collection were essentially taxes on goods and should be abolished. Brokering in Jiangsu Province, especially in rice and grains, is vital, especially as this year has been marked by famine and food shortages in Jiangnan. Reliable distribution from distant places is essential to alleviate the situation. If rice shops in various regions are required to collect business tax on behalf of merchants, it would be highly inappropriate for the current distribution of food. The central government clearly ordered the localities to abolish likin in the 20th year of the Republic to reduce harassment, which is not in accordance with this order. After consulting with neighboring counties such as Wu County and Wujin, their feedback was consistent. Yesterday, they urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Provincial Finance Department, requesting a special exemption to facilitate commerce and benefit the local economy.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<h3>Interception of Smuggled Rice Boats at Hupu Estuary</h3>
<p>Due to severe disasters in the county this summer, rice production has sharply declined, and rice prices have soared since the beginning of winter. The provincial government previously issued a clear order to prohibit the leakage of rice from the mainland. The county government, in conjunction with various agencies, organized a Food Management Committee, headed by Wu Yu, to manage affairs. However, it was repeatedly reported to the government that Fushan was exporting rice for sale to Jiangbei. Because Wu failed in his duties, he was dismissed by the county. A rice merchant from Nantong, Chen Yunsheng, brought an official letter from his county to Changshu to purchase 1,500 dan of japonica rice and requested the county government to issue a passport. The rice was processed on the 7th and loaded onto eleven boats for export at the Hupu estuary. However, the plan was leaked and discovered by the local people, who intercepted and inspected it at the sea mouth. While the passport stated 1,500 dan, the actual amount loaded was over 3,000 dan, a significant discrepancy. The rice boats were therefore detained and placed in the custody of Ren Fei'an of the Hupu Fishermen's Association. The county government was notified by telegram to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Two Steamships Race and One Sinks</h3>
<p>Donglai Town in this county is close to Xiyi. Someone there has established the Northeast Steamship Company, operating daily trips between Xiyi and Changshu, which is convenient and prosperous. Seeing that the company is quite profitable, Qian Yuesheng, a merchant in Luyuan, also organized the Datong Steamship Company, running a steamship between Wuxi and Luyuan in this county. This resulted in fierce competition between the two companies. On the 8th of this month, the Northeast Steamship Company's regular steamship was passing near Langan Bridge on its way from Xiyi to Changshu when it suddenly collided with the Hongfei steamship of the Datong Company. The Northeast steamship was holed and flooded, and soon sank. Many passengers also fell into the water. Negotiations between the two parties were ineffective, and a lawsuit has now been filed in the county.</p>
<h3>Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law's Conflict Leads to Tragedy in the Middle of the Night</h3>
<p>Wu Fulin, of Xishabin, Dongtang City, Third District, has a son named Yongsheng, who married Wang Xiuying from the same village as his wife. They have been married for less than a year, but the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are at odds and seem irreconcilable. They even engaged in a mutual knife fight, resulting in one death and one injury. This case occurred on the 6th of this month. Due to the distance between the city and the countryside and the lack of telephone communication, it was not until the afternoon of the next day that the case was brought to the city, causing a sensation. Such a murder case between a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law is truly bizarre and unprecedented. The details are as follows: Xishabin, about three miles from Dongtang City, is inhabited by people all named Wu, hence the name Wu Family Homestead. Wu Fulin, a farmer, lives there with his son Wu A'si and grandson Agou. Fulin is forty years old and has been widowed for nine years. He has a son named Yongsheng, who is now seventeen and helps with the family business. Two years ago, Fulin married Xiuying, the daughter of Wang Zhangquan, from across the river, to his son Yongsheng after being introduced by someone, and the wedding was held in October last year. Unexpectedly, Yongsheng was not fully developed and did not understand romance, so Xiuying often felt that her youth was wasted and was unhappy. Agou, the son of Wu A'si, although from a farming family, was handsome and often tempted Xiuying, taking the opportunity to spread slander about Wang Zhangquan, hoping to alienate Yongsheng and Xiuying and take her for himself. However, due to their uncle-nephew relationship, it never erupted. Since then, Xiuying often returned to her mother's house, neglecting her father-in-law and husband. This summer, Xiuying suddenly fell ill at her husband's house. Yongsheng was inexperienced, so Fulin personally took care of her, bringing her medicine and showing great concern. After Xiuying recovered, Fulin had inappropriate thoughts and even made advances to his daughter-in-law, repeatedly behaving improperly. Xiuying firmly refused and returned to her mother's house for several months. Now that the autumn harvest is in full swing and farming is busy, Fulin plans to bring his daughter-in-law back to help with the work. Unexpectedly, upon returning, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law quarreled as soon as they met and soon went back to her mother's home. Later, Fulin blamed Wu A'si and his son for instigating his daughter-in-law's departure, leading to another conflict. A'si, in anger, hired a boat to Wang's place that night (the 6th) to bring Xiuying back. Unexpectedly, the tragedy occurred deeper in the night. After Xiuying returned, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law quarreled more and more fiercely, not stopping until midnight. Later, for some unknown reason, a fight broke out, causing the situation to escalate. Fulin took a kitchen knife and went straight in, slashing his daughter-in-law wildly. Yongsheng saw this and called for help. When neighbors Zhu Xubao and others arrived, they saw the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law lying in a pool of blood. Xiuying's head had been slashed five times, bleeding profusely, and her left hand had three knife wounds, with her index finger falling to the ground. Fulin had cut his throat and was barely alive. They then reported to the woman's father, Wang Zhangquan, and others, who arrived to find the scene extremely tragic. They sent both to the trauma clinic for help, but Fulin had cut his throat and died before dawn, and Xiuying was also in critical condition. After discussion, it was believed that Wu A'si and his son were suspected of instigation. Therefore, Wu Yongsheng and Wang Zhangquan came forward to accuse Wu A'si and Wu Agou of inciting murder and brought them to the county government on the evening of the 7th. After detailed interrogation, they claimed that there was no instigation, implying that Fulin committed suicide by slitting his throat after slashing his daughter-in-law. Both defendants have been detained. The next day, the county sent examiner He Cheng down to the village to investigate.</p>

<h3>Completion of Baojia System in Six Counties Under District</h3>
<p>The Baojia system in the six counties of Tong, Ru, Jing, Chong, Hai, and Qi under the Nantong district has now been completed.

<h3>Murder Case in Dayunsi Town</h3>
<p>In Fangjiabang, Dayunsi Town, a resident named Zhu Along, who is elderly, has an only son named Axiong, who married a Zhang woman as his wife two years ago. After she married into the family, her husband died. Zhu Zhengxiang, a member of the clan, took the opportunity to encourage Ye Yinlin, a villager, to live with Zhu's wife so that she could continue the family line. For several months, they lived in peace. However, Lin behaved poorly and indulged in gambling, often asking the old man for money to waste. Zhu Along, distressed by the constant harassment, often thought of ending his life. Yesterday, when Zhang went elsewhere, only the old man was at home. Ye Yinlin again asked for money, and the two quarreled. Lin then beat Zhu Along with his fists and feet, causing him to die from his injuries. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, Ye Yinlin took all the money and belongings and fled without a trace. The local police reported the incident to the county court, which dispatched officials to the village for investigation.</p>

<h3>Additional News on Urgent Disaster Relief Donation</h3>
<p>Scout Council Has Received Over 8,000 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the mobilization of over 5,000 scouts on the 8th, they have been collecting donations along the streets for urgent disaster relief. Due to the urgency of the matter, the Scout Council was unable to prepare adequately, so only over 80 groups participated in the general donation, with over 30 groups unable to participate.</p>
<p>The results of the scouts' general donation along the streets are still being tallied and finalized as of yesterday. Over 80 groups have submitted their donations to the Scout Council, totaling over 8,000 yuan. In addition to sending them to the general directorate of the committees for general donations for urgent relief to disaster areas, other groups were unable to submit them all to the council for forwarding to the general donation for urgent relief committee due to the Sunday holiday yesterday, so they must be submitted to the council today. During this general donation, young students ran around all day soliciting donations, and their enthusiasm for disaster relief is commendable. People in the community were very moved.</p>
<p>Since the city launched a general donation for urgent relief to disaster areas, Mr. Du Yuesheng, a community leader, and the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track agreed to hold dog races for two days to raise funds for the general donation for urgent relief. It is reported that over 16,000 yuan has been delivered some days ago, and the second installment will be delivered soon, estimated at over 30,000 yuan. Mr. Du Yuesheng has also written to the Huili Ball Park, requesting two days to be set aside for the general donation for urgent disaster relief, which is expected to be held soon. As for performing charity shows for urgent relief, Mr. Du Yuesheng has already arranged everything separately. Mr. Du's enthusiasm for urgent relief is a model for the community and is highly admired.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fourth District Shipbuilding Industry Labor Union, because its employers are British merchants, found it difficult to implement the General Labor Union's regulations for deducting wages, so they plan to voluntarily solicit donations from workers and have issued 3,000 receipts in three denominations: two jiao, four jiao, and one yuan.</p>
<p>The general directorate received 2,000 yuan in silver dollars and 40,000 jiao in small coins from the Scout Council yesterday. Due to the large amount, they have not yet been counted. The Shanghai Private Middle School Scout donated 233 yuan in silver dollars, over 4,900 jiao in small coins, and over 12,000 copper coins. The Sisheng Scout donated 18 yuan in silver dollars, over 1,100 jiao in small coins, and 15,008 copper coins. The Chongshi Scout donated 37 yuan in silver dollars and over 800 jiao in small coins.</p>
<p>The general directorate received 10,000 large slogans from the Zhongnan Printing Company and others. Yesterday morning, special staff members were dispatched to distribute slogans and Mayor Wu's letter to the citizens along the streets in various urban areas to promote the campaign. They also sent 10,000 large slogans and 5,000 copies of Mayor Wu's letter to the citizens to the Public Security Bureau and the General Labor Union for distribution and posting on various streets and in various factories to call the citizens' attention to the urgent general donation to rescue the disaster area.

<h3>After the Ministry of Finance Revised Import Taxes, Sales of Domestically Produced Coal are Thriving</h3>
<p>Imports of Foreign Coal Reduced by Half This Year</p>
<p>Our country's coal industry, previously affected by the dumping of foreign merchants, experienced extreme panic. It is now learned that since the Ministry of Finance revised import taxes, the domestic coal industry has become quite active. The "New News Agency" reporter specially inquired about the situation from the coal industry yesterday and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Sales of Domestic Coal are Brisk This Year. Our country's coal industry was previously affected by the dumping of foreign coal, and sales gradually became sluggish. After the Ministry of Finance revised import taxes, it was calculated that various types of foreign coal, such as Haiphong, Hongay, MacKay, and Kailan, had to pay an additional tax of about six yuan per ton, plus an additional one yuan for water freight. The cost of foreign coal increased, resulting in brisk sales of domestic coal. According to the Coal Industry Association yesterday, sales of domestic coal in this city totaled 427,929 tons in the first half of the year, while sales in October alone in the second half of the year reached as many as 122,278 tons. It is expected that sales in November and this month will be even higher than this figure. It can be seen that after the increase in import taxes, the sales of domestic coal are booming. Therefore, they are very optimistic about the future of the industry.</p>
<p>Imports of Foreign Coal are Gradually Decreasing. In peacetime, the most imports of foreign coal are from French Hongay, Haiphong, MacKay, British Kailan, and Japanese Fushun, among others. In the first half of the year in this city, imports of foreign coal totaled 591,009 tons, while imports are gradually decreasing. According to a report from the National Trade Bureau, as of the end of October this year, foreign coal statistics are: Annam 1.3 million tons, Japan 1.17 million tons, India 480,000 tons, and the remaining Dutch East Indies, etc., 460,000 tons, totaling about 4.76 million tons, a decrease of more than half compared to last year.</p>
<h3>Export of Chinese Tea to Russia</h3>
<p>Value Increased, But Green Tea Decreased Sharply</p>
<p>According to the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the annual consumption of tea in the Soviet Union is very large. Through years of efforts in planting, domestic production has continued to increase. The area under tea cultivation has now expanded to 35,000 hectares, and the production of green tea this year reached 6,560 tons. Twenty-one new tea factories were built last year, producing 748 tons of tea, while this year it was 1,480 tons, an increase of about one-fold compared to before. The value of our country's tea exports to Russia in the first ten months of this year totaled 5,608,956 gold units, an increase compared to 4,235,124 gold units in the same period last year. However, the green tea item has decreased from 1,074,595 gold units to 407,937 gold units, a decrease of more than one and a half times. In addition to the increase in domestic production in the Soviet Union, it is also due to the competition and squeeze from Japanese tea.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Abolition of Jiangxi Province Porcelain Tax</h3>
<p>The Other Five Categories Have Been Suspended</p>
<p>How Can the Porcelain Tax Exist Alone?</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Regarding the petition, according to the Shanghai Porcelain Industry Association, when the Jiangxi Porcelain Production and Sales Tax was changed to the Porcelain Special Business Tax in the 21st year of the Republic of China, Zhao Zijiang and other representatives of Jingdezhen porcelain merchants submitted a petition to the Jiangxi Department of Finance, stating that this temporary alternative measure, when the Jiangxi Special Goods Production and Sales Bandit Suppression Post-Disaster Tax is abolished in the future, the Porcelain Special Business Tax recognized this time should also be abolished at the same time. On November 21 of that year, the Jiangxi Department of Finance issued Approval No. 2243, approving that when the aforementioned Bandit Suppression Post-Disaster Tax is abolished, the Special Business Tax recognized by the industry will enjoy the same treatment as other industries. At that time, there were six categories of Bandit Suppression Post-Disaster Taxes, and the other five categories have been abolished and suspended on July 1 of this year. However, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Finance still approves the annual tax amount for the porcelain industry and invites merchants to contract it, changing the temporary production and sales tax into a permanent nature, which is inconsistent with the established case of approving equal treatment for merchants. It violates the order to abolish Likin and also conflicts with the sixth item of the scope of abolishing exorbitant taxes and levies set by this year's National Finance Conference, which states that taxes and levies that hinder transportation and are levied on goods or vehicles passing through are all exorbitant and should be abolished. It is requested that it be forwarded for abolition. The association has checked the attached photograph of the approval from the Jiangxi Department of Finance, and the submitted information is all true. The industry has borne the temporary Bandit Suppression Post-Disaster Tax for nearly two years, and it has been eager to help the public and has not lagged behind. Now that other industries have been exempted, the industry's burden remains the same. How can it be fair and show great faith to the porcelain merchants? The association should submit the same photograph of the approval, requesting your department to review and approve it, and instruct Jiangxi Province to abolish the bureau and suspend the tax in accordance with the original agreement, which would be a public convenience."</p>
<h3>Settlement of the Case of the "Songpu" Collision with the French Warship</h3>
<p>The Three North Company's Yangtze River ship "Songpu" collided with a French warship in the Huangpu River when it set sail from Shanghai to Hankou. It is learned that the case has been settled, with the Three North Company paying the repair costs.</p>
<p>Cause of the Collision. The "Songpu" ship was loaded with goods and passengers in Shanghai last Friday and set sail from the Hongsheng wharf in Pudong. When the ship reached the Huangpu River, the French gunboat "Savorgnan de Brazza" was moored there, but because it was at night and the French warship did not have its lights on, it could not be seen, causing the bow of the "Songpu" to collide with the French warship. The outer hull of the French warship was damaged by the collision, and the iron plate was damaged. The "Songpu" quickly reversed, so it was not seriously damaged itself.</p>
<p>Joint Inspection by Both Parties. After the incident, the shipowner of the "Songpu" reported it to the company, and the French warship also reported it to the customs. The shipowner and captain inspected the damage on the spot. The "Songpu" continued to sail to the Yangtze River as usual. The next day, the Three North Company, together with the French warship, sent impartial personnel to the ship to inspect the collision damage and then discussed the handling method. They also invited impartial personnel to estimate the amount of the damage for repairs.</p>
<p>Settlement of the Negotiation. Yesterday, the Three North Company reached a settlement with the French warship. The Three North Company will pay the repair costs for the damage to the ship caused by the collision of the "Songpu," according to the actual estimated repair costs. The case was satisfactorily resolved. The "Songpu" has peace insurance, so it is reported that the insurance company will pay the compensation.</p>
<h3>Report on Disaster Relief in Haining by the Bodhi Society</h3>
<p>Chen Meiqing of the local Bodhi Dharma Assembly was sent to Haining to investigate and release the first district's emergency relief. His report states that the disaster situation in the 18 villages and towns of the first district of Haining County is detailed as follows: Since November 4, the society began to investigate and issue relief tickets to each household. It was observed that the farmers in the villages and towns of the district were in dire straits. The reason is that in previous years, silk cocoons were abundant, and the economy was prosperous, which inevitably led to waste and no savings on weekdays. The disaster of Renshen (1932) was still bearable for the farmers. In recent years, silk cocoon farmers have gone bankrupt one after another, coupled with the economic downturn, high rice prices, and high living costs, as well as successive natural disasters. This autumn, there has been a severe drought, with no water at all, and the scorching sun has raged, turning the drought into a disaster. There has been no harvest. Farmers are destitute. The association conducted a village investigation and witnessed withered rice stalks, only a foot tall, remaining in the fields. Those that looked promising were all empty husks and white water. There was no hope of a harvest. Farmers had no savings, and all mortgages had been exhausted. We also saw village women and children with hunger and yellowing faces. Their suffering is difficult to describe. In the blink of an eye, winter will arrive, and it is unknown how they will survive. The society's relief funds are limited and are a drop in the bucket, making it difficult to provide comprehensive coverage. Only the extremely poor, elderly, young, orphans, and widows among the farmers were given relief. The society is unable to cope and is helpless. It is hoped that the national government and philanthropists at home and abroad will quickly provide post-disaster winter relief so that the farmers who are waiting to be fed can overcome the difficulties of this year and seek social stability. This is a deep hope and prayer. May the country be fortunate, and may the farmers be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Official Land in County to be Paid for and Upgraded to Taxable Land</h3>
<p>Methods Resolved at Land Consolidation Discussion Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, stating that the Shangbao Shatian Official Property Bureau had requested that Shangbao counties jointly measure the excess land and land occupied for planting without grain, and that the people should pay for them according to regulations, issue certificates, and upgrade them to taxable land. Based on this, it ordered to comply with and handle it. After receiving the order, the county magistrate convened the sixth meeting of the Land Consolidation Discussion Committee yesterday and specially submitted it for discussion at the meeting. The following methods were resolved immediately: (1) For land that is measured and found to have no documents and no grain and is proven to be official wasteland occupied by the people for planting, the people should pay for it according to regulations. (2) For land with grain and documents, or originally with documents that have been lost, but still have grain registers and registers to check, it belongs to private property. If the measured excess is small, the measures for handling the measured excess land interpreted by the Judicial Yuan ordered by the Provincial Land Bureau should be followed, and grain should be levied on the actual land. If the measured land is insufficient, shorter than the original document, the tax amount should be corrected. (3) The village land recorded in the register, originally divided into one mu of land or two or three mu as one mu to pay grain, the land obtained according to the allowable number is the actual land that the allowable land should have and cannot be referred to as land without documents and no grain and treated as official property. Whether it should be canceled in the future, the allowable conversion method or the change of the allowable land tax rules, the actual land should be upgraded to taxable land, and a report should be submitted to the department for approval, as it involves changing the amount of land tax. If there is still a small excess outside the allowable number, it should be handled according to the measures resolved in Article 2. (4) Newly formed beaches along the river and coast that have not been paid for should be paid for according to regulations. Those that have been paid for but have not been upgraded to taxable land should be upgraded to taxable land uniformly. (5) Inland river water beaches have been silted up for many years, and the original river width is mostly vague. Staff should be sent to measure and determine the river width and report to the Construction Department for approval. Then, the silted land outside the river width without documents and no grain should be paid for and upgraded to taxable land according to regulations.</p>

<h3>After the "Shun'an" Ship Was Detained, the Crew Requested Payment of Unpaid Wages</h3>
<p>Joint Request to the Seamen's Party Department for Negotiation</p>
<p>The "Shun'an" ship (formerly known as "Fusheng") of the Shun'an Company on Zhonghua Road, Dunhou Lane, in this city, which specializes in sailing between Shanghai, Xinghua, and Quanzhou, had its Shanghai general manager, Chen Youbo, running a speculation business and owing public funds. He arranged for the shipowner, Ouyang Tai, to blow up the ship halfway to obtain insurance money, agreeing to divide it into four or six shares. Later, the shipowner surrendered himself to the Sandu Ao Customs, and the customs detained the ship and crew. Manager Chen Youbo was also detained by the Shanghai Court. However, the entire ship's crew, including engineers, drivers, stokers, sailors, tallymen, and other employees, a total of more than fifty people, had their wages unpaid for four months because the company's ship was detained. They are all extremely panicked because of livelihood relations. They plan to jointly request the Seamen's Party Department to negotiate the payment.</p>
<h3>Employees of the Shanghai-Taicang Bus Company Petitioned Party and Government Agencies Separately</h3>
<p>Demanding Guarantees and Investigation of Zhou Jintang</p>
<p>Published a Letter to All Circles detailing the Process</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, after accepting advice to resume operations, all employees of the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company petitioned Party and government agencies, demanding guarantees and punishment of Zhou Jintang. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petitioning Party and Government All employees decided through a meeting to organize a petition delegation, demanding: (1) Removal and investigation of Zhou Jintang, who has abused his power, (2) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again in the future. On the previous day, Yu Tingwu, Zhu Duanfu, Wang Jizhang, and others presented petitions to Party and government agencies. Chen Jiaju received them at the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, Cai Hongtian received them at the Shanghai Party Headquarters, Secretary Wang received them at the Baoshan County Government, and Zhu Xuedian received them at the Baoshan County Party Headquarters. All agreed to investigate and verify the matter.</p>
<p>Letter to All Circles. The entire staff hereby respectfully informs all circles of the facts of the illegal arrest of colleague Mr. Xu Zhixiang by Zhou Jintang, chief of the Second Public Security Branch of Baoshan County. On the morning of the 6th of this month at 10:00 AM, when the Shanghai-Kaizhi bus arrived at Liuhang Station, (excerpt) However, Xu Zhixiang's detention of the free ride ticket without a certificate and symbol was in accordance with the company's regulations and there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. However, he was illegally arrested by the chief of the Second Public Security Branch, slandered and framed, and his upper body was tied up and paraded through the streets during the escort. Everyone witnessed the contempt for the law and the insult to his personality, which was extreme. Colleagues believe that the law has lost its protection, and everyone is in danger from now on. They were forced to temporarily ask for leave based on their personal intentions to avoid the ferocity. Later, after the manager met with the Baoshan County Magistrate, he relayed the intention and instructed them to resume work first. Colleagues took into account the importance of transportation and immediately resumed work as usual, waiting for a solution. Today, colleagues decided through a meeting to organize a petition delegation and prepare a memorandum to petition the Baoshan County Government, etc. It is not enough to quell public anger without removing and investigating Zhou Jintang, who has abused his power and violated the law. I hope that all circles will provide guidance and assistance to highlight justice. The urgency to await orders is overwhelming.</p>

<h3>The bustling marketplace is seen as a thorny path</h3>
<p>Thugs hold up travelers in the early morning</p>
<p>Ningbo Fellow Association Sends Letter Requesting Investigation</p>
<p>The 16th Pier in this city is where ships dock and merchants gather. Common thugs take advantage of the time when ships arrive and positions have not been restored in the early morning, forming groups of three or five to hold up travelers. Many have been victimized, especially Ningbo people traveling to Shanghai. The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association has received repeated reports from its members requesting preventative measures. However, these thugs show no fear of the law, and their rampant behavior continues even with some precautions. The Association has again suggested to the Public Security Bureau that patrols be dispatched every morning. The letter is excerpted below: We are writing to inform you that, according to a letter from our member Qian Liantang, our Ningbo ships arrive in port around six or seven o'clock in the morning. Women from our hometown are eager to get home and hire vehicles to travel to Xiaodongmen, Minguo Road, and Xinkaihe, where they are often held up by groups of thugs. Cries for help are often heard. Under broad daylight, such robberies occur along the way. The bustling marketplace is seen as a thorny path. We are requesting that you forward this letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and ask them to quickly take preventative measures. Our Association has previously reported similar incidents to your Bureau and requested that you take measures to stop them. However, these unfortunate events continue to occur, which is deeply regrettable. Perhaps it is because the police have not yet taken their posts in the early morning that the thugs are able to take advantage and harm merchants. Our humble opinion is that your Bureau should dispatch a team of police officers to patrol that section of the road every morning to prevent these incidents. If this suggestion is adopted, not only will the people of our hometown benefit greatly, but the future of public safety will also be greatly enhanced. We await your response.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Saves a Life</h3>
<p>Wei Xiangxue's plight is pitiful</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 2:30 AM, a young man was found hanging himself with an electric wire from a tree next to the residence of the owner of Yu Liangxin Pharmacy on Dong Maqiao in the city. While he was struggling for breath, Police Officer Su Junqing of the 10th post heard the sound, realized something was wrong, and went to investigate. Seeing the man in imminent danger, he quickly and carefully rescued him. The man was unable to speak, but after the police officer gave him hot water and performed artificial respiration, he regained consciousness after a while. When asked why he attempted suicide, he stared blankly and did not answer. He was taken to the Lao Beimen Police Station. After questioning by Chief Shen, he identified himself as Wei Xiangxue, 24 years old, from Yixing, and residing at No. 3 Jiqingli, Henan Road. After graduating from higher primary school, he came to Shanghai to work in the sales department of the East Asia Sports College for several years. Later, he entered the China Steel Central Business Office. Unfortunately, he was laid off at the end of last month. He turned to relatives and friends for help, but was met with cold shoulders. He lamented the vicissitudes of life and wished to leave this wicked world. Although he was rescued, he still sees no way out. Chief Shen, pitying his youth, ordered him to be sent to the bureau for assistance.</p>
<h3>A Woman in Her Prime Gives Birth to a Monstrous Fetus</h3>
<p>Flat and Level Above the Eyebrows</p>
<p>With No Forehead or Hair</p>
<p>Shen Cangfu, from Shaoxing, works at a silk shop in this city. He married a woman named Yuan, and they rent a place at No. 131 Sanyuanfang, Yangshupu. Mrs. Yuan, who is nearing her prime, gave birth to a daughter after marrying Shen, but the child died at the age of three. This spring, she became pregnant again. On the morning of the 5th of this month, she suddenly felt abdominal pain and knew that she was about to give birth. She hired Mrs. Wang Yu, a fellow villager who lived nearby, as a midwife, agreeing to pay her ten yuan for one month of service. Mrs. Yuan suffered until 2:30 AM that night before finally giving birth. The infant, a girl, landed in the basin, but made no sound. When illuminated by candlelight, the child's facial features and limbs were fully formed, but the head was markedly different from normal. Above the eyebrows, it was flat and level, with no forehead or hair, covered only by a thin layer of skin. A person without a brain has no hope of agility, so the child died as soon as it was born, like a flash in the pan. Mr. and Mrs. Shen believed that the child's death was due to Mrs. Wang Yu's failure to perform the delivery properly, causing the child's head to hit the basin, resulting in the condition. They refused to honor the service agreement and did not pay the midwife any fee. However, the midwife firmly stated that she was not responsible for any negligence and insisted on receiving her due payment. They argued and clashed. Shen then took the dead child and dragged the midwife to the Yangqiao Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, Mrs. Wang Yu was told to leave, and the child's body was sent to the Philen Road mortuary. Yesterday, a report was made to the First Special District District Court Prosecutor's Office, which appointed Prosecutor Song to lead a forensic doctor to the mortuary to examine the body. After questioning Shen and Mrs. Wang Yu, they determined that the child was indeed a deformed fetus, which had great significance for physiological research. They ordered the child's body to be temporarily stored in the mortuary for research. It is truly a monstrous fetus.</p>
<h3>Luring Women to Qingdao for Trafficking</h3>
<p>Zhang A'mei Almost Falls into a Trap</p>
<p>Zhang Caiyun Still Being Solicited</p>
<p>- One Case Leads to Another -</p>
<p>Zhang A'mei, a woman from Suzhou, is 18 years old and used to work as a hostess at the New World Amusement Park. She is slightly attractive and very romantic. She became acquainted with Zhou A'si and had an affair. Later, when the New World Amusement Park closed, Zhang lived with her sister, Zhang A'jin, at the Wang Yuanchang Electric Shop on Guling Road, but secretly continued her affair with Zhou A'si. Little did she know that Zhou was a rogue. Seeing that Zhang's money was running out, he had evil intentions. Not only did he abandon his former love, but he also wanted to traffic her to another location to get a huge price for her, which he would waste. He secretly discussed this matter with Chen Shouming (also known as Zhang Shouming), a Hubei native living at No. 34 Santai Lane. Chen often went to Qingdao, and his mistress, Chen Zhu, from Tongzhou, whose nickname was Da Mai, was quite familiar with local thugs in the Qingdao area. Zhu colluded with Mu Gu, a woman from Songjiang, to make arrangements with someone surnamed in Qingdao. Zhou A'si falsely told Zhang that he had found her a factory job in Qingdao with a monthly salary of 30 yuan, and asked her to go there. Zhang believed him and went to Chen Shouming's house at No. 34 Santai Lane on the 4th to stay temporarily. Chen bought five boat tickets, preparing to leave for Qingdao in two batches yesterday. Chen and Zhou were in the first batch, and Chen Zhu, Mu Gu, and Zhang A'mei were in the second batch. Zhu and A'mei pretended to be sisters to avoid scrutiny along the way. Everything was ready, but the plan was not kept secret. The detectives from the Huishi Police Station, Liang Yuliang, Bao Wenbin, and Chen Kezhang, learned of the plan and secretly went to No. 34 Santai Lane at 11:50 PM the day before yesterday, arresting Chen Shouming, Chen Zhu, Mu Gu, Chen's brother Chen Shouyu, Chen's sister-in-law Chen Xu, Chen's younger brother Chen Fufu, and Zhang A'mei. Zhou A'si was not present and escaped the arrest. The detectives found three boat tickets on Chen Shouming and two boat tickets and two letters on Chen Zhu. The letters generally stated when the goods (referring to the person) would arrive. A photo of a woman was also found on Mu Gu. Based on the photo and the statements of the arrested, another case arose. The woman in the photo was Zhang Caiyun from Wuxi, 17 years old, tall, and beautiful. Three days ago, she was lured by Chen Xiuying, a woman from the same hometown, and traveled to Shanghai with Lu Zizhen by car. They first stayed at Room 17 of the Sutai Hotel on Sima Road, and then moved to No. 111 Taianli on Tiantong Road. It was also learned that Mu Gu was an experienced trafficker, and had sent Zhang Caiyun's photo to Qingdao to solicit customers. If a buyer was found, she would be informed by letter to bring her there. The detectives then went to No. 111 Taianli and arrested Chen Xiuying, Lu Zizhen, and their accomplices Gu Agen and Fang Fuzhang, along with Zhang Caiyun, and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the above situation and requested permission to detain the arrested. After questioning by Judge Wu Tingqi, Chen Shouyu, Chen Xu, Chen Fufu, and Gu Agen were allowed to be released on bail, subject to immediate recall. The remaining persons were detained and the trial was postponed for seven days. Zhang A'mei was taken back by her sister, Zhang A'jin, and Zhang Caiyun was sent to a relief organization for temporary shelter.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving Plagiarism of a Word Identification Book</h3>
<p>Gu Xiongzhao Sues Zhou Tianlai</p>
<p>Self-Suit for Infringement of Copyright</p>
<p>Gu Xiongzhao edited a book called "Word Identification," which sold well after publication. Later, Zhou Tianlai also edited a "Word Identification" book, but the annotations in Zhou's book used vernacular instead of classical Chinese, and it was published and sold by the Huawen Bookstore on Shandong Road. Gu learned that Zhou's book contained a large amount of plagiarism from his book. Gu's "Word Identification" had been approved and registered by the Ministry of Interior and obtained copyright. Zhou's plagiarism violated the Publication Law. Therefore, Gu hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-suit against Zhou in the First Special District District Court for infringement of copyright. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the court to summon the plaintiff and defendant, but neither party appeared in person. Judge Huang then adjourned the hearing and summoned the defendant on the afternoon of the 12th of this month. He also ordered the plaintiff to submit the registration certificate issued by the Ministry of Interior for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Bandits Are Insatiable</h3>
<p>Successful Extortion Once</p>
<p>Continuing to Send Threatening Letters</p>
<p>Ni A'er, a foreman from Tongzhou at the Guanghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Liyuan Road, Ximen, was shot in the chest on October 4th. When he was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment, Chen A'er, a fellow villager, went to the hospital and said that the person who shot him was Zhang Yuebao, and he had to pay 700 yuan as a longevity fee, otherwise his life would be in danger in the future. Ni was very frightened when he heard this. After Ni recovered and was discharged from the hospital, fearing that Zhang would retaliate, he entrusted Chen A'er and his friend, Zhang Shixiong, also from the same village, to deliver the money to a certain place in Suzhou. Only then was he able to live in peace. Unexpectedly, Ni recently received a threatening letter, initially demanding 2,000 yuan, and then increasing it to 3,000 yuan. The letter stated that if he ignored the demands, drastic measures would be taken. Ni knew that it was Chen A'er and others who were trying to extort him a second time for their own squandering. He reported the situation to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which dispatched Foreman Fang Lingen, Detective Wan Ruhai, and Bian Wenguang to investigate. They learned that Chen A'er and Zhang Shixiong were hiding at No. 60 Wuhuali, Qiwupu Road, and No. 52 Huade Road in the Public Concession. They requested the Yulin Road Police Station to assist in the arrest the day before yesterday. The police chief sent Detective Sun Zhenqing secretly to the addresses and arrested Chen and Zhang. They were taken to the police station for detention and sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court the next morning. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Public Works Bureau, stated the above circumstances. The victim, Ni A'er, testified about the events. Yu Caigen, also from Tongzhou, testified that the letter was indeed written by Chen A'er. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao ordered that Chen A'er and Zhang Shixiong be handed over to the officers from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to be transferred back for interrogation.</p>

However, around 7 PM last night, after Wang finished dinner and went to a nearby wasteland to defecate, three thugs suddenly rushed towards Wang, pulled out a handgun, and fired a shot at Wang's abdomen. The bullet exited through his back, and he died on the spot. After reporting to the police station, the body was taken to the mortuary to await a report to the Second Special District Court for examination.</p>
<h3>National Products Sales in Nanyang Are Sluggish; The Ministry of Industry Is Taking Measures to Remedy the Situation</h3>
<p>Urging Overseas Chinese to Establish Commodity Display Centers</p>
<p>To Convene Importers and Exporters to Discuss Measures</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry believes that in recent years, Nanyang's commerce has been affected by the economic downturn, and foreign goods have been dumped on a large scale, causing the national products of our country and the livelihoods of overseas Chinese to decline. In order to remedy this situation as soon as possible, it has formulated three measures to revitalize national products. In addition to actively urging Chinese Chambers of Commerce in various overseas Chinese ports in Nanyang to establish commodity display centers and investigate foreign goods dumping organizations in order to remedy the situation, it will also convene national goods manufacturers engaged in import and export trade to discuss assisting in the promotion of national products in order to develop trade with Nanyang.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhongying Discusses the Preparation Process for the Jiangxi Provincial National Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Domestic Manufacturers Association led member manufacturers to participate in the Jiangxi Provincial Capital National Products Exhibition. Due to misunderstandings among the business community in that province, the exhibition was repeatedly postponed, and the preparation time reached three months. It is now known that the exhibition officially opened on the 8th of this month. Yesterday, Standing Committee member Liu Zhongying of the Association gave a detailed account of the participation in the Jiangxi exhibition, which is specially recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Initiation and Organization: It is said that the Jiangxi National Products Exhibition was originally initiated by the Association, which had sent letters and telegrams to various party and government agencies in Jiangxi Province, and received their agreement. The province then vigorously supported and welcomed the exhibition with repeated telegrams (as reported in the newspapers). The Association then sent personnel to Jiangxi to prepare for the exhibition together with various sectors of Jiangxi society. First, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Department and Provincial Government convened a joint meeting of representatives from various Jiangxi agencies and the Association to resolve the holding of the exhibition, and established the Jiangxi National Products Exhibition Preparatory Committee. Regarding the expenses of manufacturers, such as booth construction and electricity costs, all were to be provided by the Association, while the Jiangxi side was responsible for the preparatory expenses. Both parties aimed to promote domestic products and recover rights and interests, and worked together.</p>
<p>Beginning Preparations: Liu also said that after the Association's representatives resolved to hold the exhibition at the joint meeting, they returned to Shanghai to report on the negotiation process and the joint meeting's proposals. The Association believed that since all sectors of Jiangxi Province were willing to provide such support, for the sake of the future of domestic products, it should make efforts to proceed. Therefore, on September 20, the Association's Standing Committee meeting resolved to announce the start of preparations and notified member manufacturers to register for participation. Because Jiangxi is the birthplace of the New Life Movement, and its publicity for the promotion of domestic products would definitely be more effective, the members all readily supported and actively participated. Within a week, the quota of 150 industries was filled.</p>
<p>Midway Obstacles: It is also said that after the Association started preparations, because it received support from various agencies in Jiangxi, the members also actively participated, and it was decided that the National Products Exhibition would open on Double Tenth Day (October 10th). A representative was specially sent to Jiangxi again to build the venue and actively make arrangements. Unexpectedly, while preparations were in full swing, the Jiangxi City Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations suddenly raised concerns about dumping and sent telegrams to the party and government agencies in Shanghai and Jiangxi, requesting the cancellation of the proposal and preventing the holding of the exhibition. The Association believed that although the Jiangxi exhibition was initiated by the Association, it had received the support of various agencies in Jiangxi. Moreover, the organizers were the Jiangxi Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government, which convened a joint meeting of representatives from various agencies. The Jiangxi City Chamber of Commerce also sent a representative, Mr. Zhou Zishi, to attend and participate in the meeting. During the meeting, the representatives not only had no words of opposition, but also did their best to support the initiative. Now that the City Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations suddenly opposed the exhibition when the Association's preparations were about to be completed, was this not childish? Therefore, based on reason, telegrams were sent to various relevant agencies to strive for the exhibition, and the opening of the National Products Exhibition was therefore repeatedly postponed until it was finally implemented on the 8th of this month.</p>
<p>Negotiation Process: It is also said that after the Jiangxi City Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations opposed the exhibition, the Jiangxi party and government agencies rejected the opposition of the City Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations after the Association protested. However, the Jiangxi side was still unwilling to accept this, and demanded the collection of public welfare donations (10% of the value) and demanded that manufacturers subsidize the Jiangxi side's office expenses (2% of the value), using various unreasonable conditions as a threat and deliberately making things difficult. The Association believed that the exhibition of domestic products, according to the regulations of the Ministry of Industry, did not impose taxes or donations, and could also be exempt from state-owned vehicle transportation fees. As for the Jiangxi side's office expenses, the representatives had resolved that the Jiangxi side would be responsible. Now the Jiangxi Province was inventing various names, obscuringly requesting harsh taxes and levies, and not complying with the resolutions, which violated the original purpose of the central government's domestic product movement. Therefore, based on the Ministry's orders and regulations, and according to the precedents of national exhibitions in various places, it requested exemption. However, the Jiangxi side still insisted on a subsidy of 1,000 for office expenses, which remained unresolved. This is truly an unfortunate phenomenon that has never occurred in the domestic product movement.</p>
<p>Opening Situation: It is also said that after the misunderstanding occurred in Jiangxi Province and the exhibition was suspended midway, the opening day was repeatedly postponed. This time it was determined to open on the 8th of this month. Because it was approaching the end of the year, it was really impossible to postpone it any further. Therefore, the Association decided to first open the exhibition as scheduled, and at the same time, according to the resolution of the representatives' meeting, continue to protest to the relevant agencies. According to a telegram from the Association's Jiangxi representative, Mrs. Xiong, the chairman's wife, cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony of the Jiangxi exhibition. Chairman Xiong and hundreds of leaders from all walks of life and manufacturer representatives attended the meeting to deliver speeches. The ceremony was very grand, and the people of Jiangxi who came to the meeting to visit and purchase goods were also very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Three Organizations Held a Meeting Yesterday to Commemorate Mr. He Caitang</h3>
<p>The Commercial Bank of China, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, and the Dinghai Native Place Association in Shanghai held a memorial service yesterday at the Dinghai Guild Hall on Pingjili Road in the French Concession for the late Mr. He Caitang, the Assistant Manager of the Commercial Bank of China. The venue was filled with elegiac couplets and poems, and the scene was unusually solemn. More than 400 people, including Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Yu Zuoting, Fu Xiaoan, Zhang Shenzhi, Fang Jiaobo, Wu Zhihao, Zhu Qixiang, and relatives and friends Zhu Zikui, Zhang Zixiang, etc., arrived. At 2:00 p.m., the bell rang, mourning music was played, and the meeting began. Mr. Chen Liangyu chaired the meeting and reported on the purpose of the meeting. Then, Mr. Chen Yiting described Mr. He's deeds, and Mr. Hu Yinong read the eulogy by Mr. Liu Hongsheng, the chairman of the Dinghai Native Place Association. Two classes of male and female primary school students from the Dinghai Native Place Association performed ceremonies in turn and sang a memorial song. Then, Mr. Fu Xiaoan described Mr. He's relationship with the Commercial Bank of China and his personal friendship with him, and proposed that Mr. He be posthumously given the title "Tong Zhong," which was unanimously approved on the spot. Later, Mr. Fang Jiaobo, Mr. Wu Zhihao, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Hong Yanbin, Mr. Xu Tingzuo, Mr. Zhang Xiaogeng, Mr. Wu Yaqin, and others delivered speeches successively, describing Mr. He's internal conduct, his literary talent, his enthusiasm for public welfare, his loyalty to his duties, his respect and love for his friends, his filial piety to his old mother, and his brotherly love in great detail. Mr. Wu Zhihao also advocated collecting Mr. He's manuscripts to prevent them from being lost, and to seek commercial assistance for his younger siblings. The audience applauded unanimously. Finally, Mr. He Qiliang, a family member, gave a speech of thanks. The meeting ended at around 4:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of the New Rose Garden Village</h3>
<p>Hundreds of people participated</p>
<p>With sincere speeches</p>
<p>The Rose Garden New Village, founded by the China New Village Construction Society, held a groundbreaking ceremony for the first phase of its plan, which is to build residences, at its base in Xijiatang Village, Huajing Township, Humin Road, Shanghai, at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 9th). It is estimated that hundreds of people attended the event. At around 12:00 noon, more than 60 cars of various sizes, all of which were black-plated private cars, were lined up in front of the Society's office at 918 Aidoa Road, opposite the Nanjing Grand Theatre. There were four to five hundred people waiting to board the cars inside the Society. At around 1:00 p.m., the Society inserted a</p>
<p>(Small red flag of the Rose Garden New Village) fluttering on each car, which was neat and beautiful. The military band of the Public Security Bureau led the way in a car, and the cars sped southwestward one after another. They proceeded along Aidoa Road and Xiafei Road, and many pedestrians stopped to watch along the way. When the cars reached Jinyi Road, Caojing Road, and Humin Road, they were able to enjoy the natural scenery without missing anything. In less than 20 minutes, they passed Shanghai High School and arrived at the base of the village. A colorful archway stood tall in front of the gate, and new and moving slogans were erected on both sides of the horizontal road inside the gate. The staff of the Society were already there to greet the guests warmly. At this time,</p>
<p>(The military band played melodious music on the grand stage) and the groundbreaking ceremony began. After the ceremony was performed as required and the party song was sung, Mr. Li Dachao, the leader of the village's recruitment team and the section chief of the Municipal Government, presided over the meeting and reported on Mr. Zhang Yongnian's founding of the village in great detail. Then, Mr. Luo Panhui, a councilor representing Mayor Wu, gave a training speech, saying briefly that the municipal and county construction were both matters of concern to the authorities, and that he greatly admired Mr. Zhang's plan and hoped that the plan would be popularized and progress would be made day by day. Next, Mr. Zhang Shouyong, a member of the Society's fund management committee,</p>
<p>(Mr. Zhang Shouyong's training speech was very sincere) said that the groundbreaking of the Rose Garden New Village was truly the only gospel for saving the countryside and creating a new city. He felt that all residents of the new village could be congratulated, and he had come today especially to congratulate everyone. He knew that the plan of Mr. Zhang Yongnian, the founder of the village, was not limited to this, and that in the future, the four suburbs of Shanghai would be continuously constructed and popularized by the China New Village Construction Society. It was verified that the base and guarantee money collected from the registered households of the Rose Garden New Village were managed by the management committee jointly formed by him and Mr. Lin Kanghou, etc.</p>
<p>(Mr. Lin Kanghou served as chairman) No public facility expenses or residential construction expenses of the Rose Garden New Village could be used without the signatures of Mr. Lin Kanghou and at least three other committee members. He asked the registered households to rest assured, and hoped that those with financial resources would invest in the new village's business to prosper the countryside. Then, Mr. Xu Xun, the Shanghai County representative and the director of the Public Security Bureau, gave a training speech, and Mr. Tang Youwei and Mr. Xi Wenguang, the representatives of the registered households, delivered speeches, briefly stating that the registered households sincerely hoped that the Society's management plan and construction project would be as good as their word, and at the same time encouraged</p>
<p>(The registered households to be the soul of the new village) Then, Mr. Chen Pinyi, the head of Huajing Township, delivered a speech, followed by speeches from the guests. Then, the groundbreaking ceremony was held, presided over by Mr. Zhang Shouyong. Finally, everyone took a group photo, played music, and the guests and hosts dispersed happily. The Society's second phase of the plan is still being solicited, and people from all walks of life who love new village life can go to the Society to visit the drawings and models.</p>
<h3>Zheng Tangsheng and Others' Conspiracy to Escape from Prison Concluded</h3>
<p>Sentencing scheduled for the 15th</p>
<p>The notorious kidnapper Zheng Tangsheng, a local, was arrested in Tianjin by detectives sent by the French Concession Police Station in the autumn of last year and brought to Shanghai. He was sent to the Second Special District Court and prosecuted in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. During the trial, Zheng once attempted suicide in the police station detention center out of fear of his crime, but was rescued and recovered. Later, he was sentenced to death. Zheng refused to accept the verdict and petitioned the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval to send the case back for retrial. Because the case was not finalized, Zheng was detained in the detention center of the Second Special District Court. Unexpectedly, in the past month, Zheng colluded with Liu Ruiqing, a guard from Yangzhou, and sent a letter to his friend Li Quangen, asking him to procure pistols, gunpowder, and strong water, hoping to set a date to escape from prison. Because the matter was not kept secret, it was leaked out and detected by the French police, who arrested Li Quangen and notified the detention center to transfer Zheng and the guard Liu Ruiqing to the prosecutor for investigation and prosecution. The police also transferred Li Quangen to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After the case was first tried by the preliminary court, it was transferred to the local court for trial due to the importance of the case. After the presiding judge of the criminal court, Wang Gangxu, and the chief prosecutor, Chen Beisan, held a court session and briefly interrogated the defendants, they ordered the witnesses Zhang Asi, Wu Shaoting, Liu Guibao, and others, who were also detained in the same place, to be brought in, and summoned Mr. Wu, the staff member of the detention center who was in charge of inspecting the prisoners' correspondence, to the case. After interrogating them, they ordered the start of the debate. First, the prosecutor stood up and stated that the defendants had committed the crime of escaping under Article 171, Paragraph 3, and the crime of bribery under Article 128 of the Criminal Law, and requested that they be punished according to the law. Then, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi argued that the circumstances of the defendants' attempt to escape had been thoroughly investigated and clarified by the court. Regarding the Criminal Law, the prosecutor had already stated that the defendants intended to damage the detention center and attempted to escape from prison by using violent coercion. The facts were obvious, and they should be severely punished according to the law. The defendant Li Quangen was defended by lawyer Shen Xingxia, who argued that, after examining the letters sent by Zheng Tangsheng to Li Quangen, there was the phrase "(If you don't find a way, I am determined to hang myself)," which showed that although Li Quangen's reply to Zheng's letter contained the words "(The things will be ready in about two or three days)," regardless of whether he was forced by Zheng Tangsheng's suicide threat and was giving comfort out of private feelings, he still said "(about)," which was difficult to recognize as a determination to help procure the items. Also, it was found that the attempt crimes in each paragraph of Article 171 of the Criminal Law were based on the act of failure to carry out the crime, not on the intention to commit the crime. This can be seen from the fact that the words "(intention)" were not added to other legal articles. Assuming that the items mentioned in Li Quangen's letter were indeed pistols, and had already been procured and prepared for delivery, which would be enough to help Zheng Tangsheng gather a crowd to violently coerce an escape, then before Zheng Tangsheng received them, it could only be recognized that Li Quangen had agreed to prepare to help Zheng Tangsheng commit a crime, but had not completed it, and had not reached the extent of facilitating Zheng's escape, and had not carried out the attempted act. What's more, the items had not been procured, and it was difficult to determine whether they would be procured. According to the law, it was difficult to recognize that he had formed an attempted escape. Also, it was found that Article 39 of the Criminal Law stated that "(an attempted crime is one that has begun to carry out the crime but has not succeeded)." In this case, Li Quangen only had the intention to help commit a crime (preparation) but did not succeed, and had not reached the stage of starting to help commit the crime (implementation). Since the preparation of the criminal intent cannot be separated from the stage of implementation, it can directly help others cause a certain result of committing a crime. According to the above-mentioned legal articles, it is even more difficult to make him bear the responsibility for attempted crime. Citing the so-called pre-event preparatory act in the judgments of the Supreme Court of the 21st year, Feizi Xin No. 9, No. 97, it should not be regarded as a precedent for starting the crime. Then, the part of Zheng Tangsheng, Li Quangen, and others' conspiracy to escape from prison, even the most important law, does not constitute a crime, etc. Zheng Tangsheng was defended by lawyer Ding Yuanpu, whose words were roughly the same as before. After verifying the statements in court, the court announced the end of the debate, and scheduled the sentencing for 9:00 a.m. on the 15th. The defendants were still returned to custody separately.</p>

<h3>Women's National Products Year Committee Hosted a Tea Party for Various Factories and Associations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing the arrangements for the Second Mobile Exhibition</p>
<p>The Women's National Products Year Movement Committee held a tea party for representatives of various factories at the Committee's headquarters at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Those who attended were Committee staff members Wang Bingpei, Ni Baiyan, and more than 30 representatives from various factories. After Chairman Huang Bingpei delivered a speech, proposals were immediately discussed. A representative from the Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory proposed that when the National Products Mobile Exhibition is held for the second time, it is best to expand the scope of manufacturers and ask organizations such as the Machine Manufacturers Association and the National Products Manufacturers Association to solicit various factories to join, so as to promote domestic products as much as possible. Mr. Xie from the Mengbo Uniform and Badge Company proposed three points for the National Products Exhibition: (1) Each factory must jointly publish a special issue for each National Products Exhibition; (2) The National Products Exhibition travels long distances, so joint transportation should be organized; (3) It is best for the Committee to be responsible for the layout of the National Products Exhibition. All of the above proposals were passed unanimously. Then, tea and snacks were served and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>A New Ghost in the Dafang Hotel</h3>
<p>The deceased claimed to be Wu Jialin</p>
<p>A traveler came to the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession at around 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. He was wearing a Western-style suit and claimed to be Wu Jialin from Nanjing, 19 years old, who worked in hardware. He was greeted and led to the fourth floor, Room 431. He went out once at around 10:00 p.m., and soon returned to bed. At 12:00 a.m. the next morning, the tea boy saw that he had not gotten up, so he knocked on the door several times, but there was no response. He then tried to pry open the door and went inside to check, and saw that he had died. Later, an empty cigarette case was found under the bed, and it was known that he had died of poisoning. He then reported it to the police station, who sent detectives to the scene to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang Mortuary to examine the body, pending a report to the court for an inspection.</p>
<h3>Record of the Establishment Meeting of the Sino-American Bank</h3>

<h3>Li Boliang Invented the Boliang Stove</h3>
<p>Li Boliang, the director of the workshop of the Dagong Vocational School, graduated from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Osaka Higher Technical School in Japan. After returning to China, he successively served as the factory director of the Pudong Hengda Yarn Factory and the director of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Jiangsu Provincial First Industrial College for more than ten years. He has specialized knowledge of various machines, and has spared no effort in research on weekdays. Recently, seeing the wood chips piled up like a mountain in the school's woodworking workshop, making it difficult to find a suitable outlet, he used waste to invent a wood chip-saving stove for heating in the cold weather. The advantages of this stove are superior to various coal-burning stoves: first, it saves money. The cost for the whole day is less than half that of a coal stove, and the firepower is greater; second, it is convenient to light. Only one match is needed, and the entire stove can be completely lit within half a minute; third, the firepower can be increased or decreased freely; fourth, regardless of size, there is no need to add fuel or remove ashes within twelve hours; fifth, you can safely go to bed and sleep at night, without any danger; sixth, it is smokeless, non-toxic, odorless, and dust-free, and is exceptionally clean; seventh, the top of the stove can be used for cooking, which can be said to kill many birds with one stone. After Mr. Li's operation, this stove has been improved again and again. The results of the public trial on Thursday this week at the school were excellent and convenient for the public. Because it is the crystallization of Mr. Li's scientific research, it is named the Boliang Stove. As for its exquisite structure and beautiful style, it is just a matter of course. It is reported that it has been submitted to the Ministry for registration and application for a patent. It is believed that once this stove becomes popular, those who need to keep warm will rush to buy it.</p>
<h3>Qu Shaoheng Warns of the Modern Cold Leg Disease</h3>
<p>The new theory is considered valuable by the medical community</p>
<p>And the "Discrimination of Misunderstandings of Postpartum Blood Stasis" can be requested</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder, and clothes should be added. However, young men and women often dislike thick clothes. Even in the severe cold, they still wear thin single-layer clothes, especially silk stockings and leather shoes on the lower body, and expose their legs, which causes the lower body to be exposed to cold, resulting in symptoms such as soreness, pain, numbness, and insensitivity, which is very dangerous. The root of this disease will increase with age. Dr. Qu Shaoheng, the director of the Shengsheng Hospital, has written an article on "Modern Cold Leg Disease," in which he explains the causes, symptoms, prevention methods, and treatments of this disease in great detail. The young men and women in Shanghai are the most modern, so there are many people who suffer from cold leg disease after a long time. If you read this book, you can know the pros and cons. According to people in the medical community, Dr. Qu's theory of modern cold leg disease is a new invention, and it is considered to be of note. This is a problem in the medical community and a problem in the outlook on life in society. Dr. Qu has also written an article on "Discrimination of Misunderstandings of Postpartum Blood Stasis," which is divided into books. Whether schools, groups, or business circles, you can attach a stamp (1 cent for local, 2 cents for out-of-town) to send a letter to (Shengsheng Hospital, Saposhen Road, French Concession, telephone 83655 for request, it will be sent as soon as possible, or bring a letter to request, no postage is required.</p>
<h3>Appeal in Counterfeit Case Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>The Defu Foreign Company at No. 261 Sichuan Road sells various pigments. One type of red pigment used for candles is produced by the German Dada Pigment Factory. The Defu Foreign Company registered the red candlestick as a trademark with the Trademark Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, and it is widely sold. In October of this year, it was discovered that the Tongrenhe Pigment Store at No. 80 Minguo Road in the French Concession was counterfeiting the red candlestick trademark and selling it on the market, which affected sales. The manager of the company, an Englishman named Li Anha (transliteration), reported it to the French police station, who sent detectives to search Tongrenhe and seized ten cans of counterfeit pigments and 3,500 counterfeit trademark papers. It was found that they were printed by the Xinmin Printing House at No. 49 Xinxin Street in the Nanshi. The owner of the store, Xu Chengxun (Zi Huiping, 35 years old, Shanghai native), was taken to the police station along with the evidence, and the police lawyer filed a public lawsuit with the Second Special District Court on the charge of obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce. After the trial was concluded, Xu Chengxun was sentenced to two months of imprisonment and a fine of 300 yuan for counterfeiting a registered trademark with the intention of deceiving others. During the appeal period, he was ordered to provide reliable shop guarantees. Xu refused to accept the original judgment and filed an appeal with the collegiate panel of the Second Special District Court. After an investigation was concluded, Wang Gangxu, the presiding judge of the criminal court, and two judges, Li Changnian and Qiu Huanqing, opened a court session to hear the case the day before yesterday. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, appeared in court. The appellant and his defense lawyer appeared in court. The original plaintiff, Li Anha, also appeared in court with an interpreter. According to the appellant's statement, since the eighteenth year, he had been trading with the Aodefu Foreign Company. In order to facilitate the payment of tariffs, he purchased large barrels of pigments and took them to Shanghai. In order to facilitate sales, he repackaged them into small cans and sold them with the original brand. He mistakenly violated the law because he was not familiar with the law. Although it was a counterfeit brand, it was different from other counterfeit situations in general. The original sentence was too severe, so he filed an appeal, requesting a change of the sentence to a lighter one. Then, after mutual debate by the two lawyers, the court announced the end of the debate and listened to the scheduled sentencing. The appellant was still released on bail by the original guarantor.</p>
<h3>Indian Police Officer Killed While Searching Pedestrians</h3>
<p>The thugs disappeared without a trace</p>
<p>At around 11:00 p.m. last night, an Indian police officer, number 258, was patrolling at the intersection of Linqing Road and Hejian Road in Yangshupu. He caught sight of two or three pedestrians coming, their faces flustered and their expressions suspicious. The officer went forward to search them, but unexpectedly one of them took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired a shot at the officer, hitting his abdomen. The officer fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the thugs ran away. After someone reported it to the police station, the police chief quickly sent Chinese and Western detectives to search everywhere, but the thugs had disappeared without a trace. The injured officer was taken to the Public Works Bureau Hospital, but he died more than ten minutes later.</p>

<h3>Preparatory Meeting for the Fourth Re-election of the Tobacco Exchange Industry</h3>

<p>The Tobacco Exchange Industry Association of this city is preparing for the fourth re-election of its membership congress. Two meetings were convened on September 10th and November 29th. However, due to the insufficient number of attendees to meet the legal quorum, both meetings were adjourned. Under the guidance of higher authorities, the association is to reconvene a properly organized meeting and hold it on a scheduled date. The association was ordered to prepare, and it is set to hold the congress on the 20th of this month at the Ningbo Native Place Association. Yesterday, a letter was sent to all committee members stating: "Regarding the upcoming re-election of the fourth Executive and Supervisory Committees, although meetings were convened twice on September 10th and November 29th, they were adjourned due to insufficient membership attendance, which is deeply regrettable. As the terms of the current committees have expired and a re-election is urgently needed, it is hoped that newly elected committee members will take on this responsibility, work hard for the association, alleviate the difficulties of the industry, and jointly seek the welfare of the trade. A joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees will be held on the 10th of this month (Monday) at 2 PM in the association hall to prepare for the congress, assign responsibilities, and facilitate progress. In addition to separate letters, this special letter is sent, hoping that esteemed committee members will take note, attend on time, and participate in the discussions, understanding the importance of this matter.

Ms. Jin studied law, and her recent translation of "The Legal Status of Women in England" was published yesterday. The content includes: (1) The status of women as citizens, (2) The status of women as wives, (3) The status of women as mothers, (4) The status of women as workers, (5) Crimes and litigations particularly relating to women, (6) The legal status of women in Scotland, etc. We know that England is a country of common law.

<h3>Victims of Private Gravesites Being Confiscated as Government Property Seek Relief from the Ningbo Native Place Association</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai received a letter yesterday from Fan Yunqing and other fellow villagers from Yin County, stating: "Since the Old Ningbo Official Property Clearance Office began clearing official property, local thugs and vagrants have taken the opportunity to covet ancestral gravesites owned by others, falsely reporting them to the Official Property Office as unclaimed land and introducing them for sale. The Official Property Office then issues notices, setting deadlines for the descendants to dismantle and relocate the graves on the land. The descendants of the affected gravesites have specifically submitted genealogies and deeds, or, in cases where deeds are temporarily unavailable, requested the Official Property Office to waive the demolition and valuation. However, these requests have not been granted. Moreover, most of these graves date back to the Qianlong era, or there are deeds without genealogies, or genealogies without deeds. Although we cannot say that the evidence is completely sufficient, some of it can be proven. Furthermore, the government has issued orders protecting ancient tombs and cemeteries, and the Official Property Office disregards merchants and accepts bribes. We request you to find a way to provide relief, etc." It is reported that the association, based on the information, sent a letter to County Magistrate Chen of the neighboring county, requesting him to negotiate with the Official Property Office and asking them to handle the matter with caution.</p>
<h3>Convenience of Mail for People from Southern Yin Staying in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to confirmed information from the Ningbo Post Office, due to the large population and developed commerce in the Yunlongqi area of the southeastern township of the neighboring county, approval was granted on October 16th to establish a postal credit office. All mail sent from Shanghai to that location will arrive in Ningbo the next day and can be transported by small steamer, arriving around noon each day. Mail sent from the township to Shanghai can also use the mailbox, directly sealed to Shanghai. This is more convenient and reliable than entrusting it to the boatmen and tea servants of the shipping vessels. It is also heard that the mailbox handles registered mail, so there is no fear of lost mail. There are many people from that area staying in Shanghai, so this will be very convenient for them.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>Xu Wancheng Solicits Answers to the "How Do I Get Rich?" Plan</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Wancheng telegraphed to the authorities of major secondary and high schools nationwide: "In this time of poverty, lack of food and clothing, malnutrition, illness, spiritual depression, and stagnation in all areas, the inferior roots of narrow-mindedness, deceit, hypocrisy, and indifference are becoming increasingly apparent. As Guanzi said, 'When food and clothing are sufficient, then one knows etiquette and righteousness.' In the future, education must focus on material construction before national rejuvenation can be achieved. Therefore, I am soliciting answers to the 'How Do I Get Rich?' plan, in other words, what are the legitimate ways for everyone to seek a livelihood, work hard, and become rich? It is definitely not buying aviation lottery tickets, gambling, pimping, or selling opium, etc., or having unrealistic thoughts of getting rich quick. I request the authorities of major secondary and high schools nationwide to solicit answers from students, so that a special collection can be published to guide each other, which will greatly benefit the youth." Mr. Xu also hopes that people from all walks of life will actively respond to this question, so that we can gather wisdom and build together to make everyone rich. Manuscripts should be sent to Xu Wancheng, Editorial Department, Longwen Bookstore, Dananmen, Shanghai. All respondents will receive a framed saying inscribed by more than forty people, including Cai Yuanpei, Ma Junwu, Huang Renzhi, Jiang Menglin, and Jiang Kanghu.

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Fawning and Flattering with a Lit Lamp to Illuminate a Withered Hungry Stomach - Displaying Frivolity</p>
<p>These last few words seemed to touch Yueying's heart, and she remained silent. Sister-in-law Hu saw her opportunity and picked up the hot water kettle to pour into the basin. She grabbed a towel and was about to wipe his face. Yueying took the towel, stood up, and sighed, "Oh! Let me do it." She was indeed a clever girl. Ready-made cosmetics were available here, and with Sister-in-law Hu's guidance, she spent thirty minutes re-touching her face. As soon as she put on a floral Western-style qipao, Xiao Ji pushed open the door and came in. Such a coincidence, he must have been peeking outside, making Yueying so ashamed that she immediately turned her back. Xiao Ji smiled at Sister-in-law Hu and said, "This move works. If you do this in front of Old Master Jia, he's sure to like it." Yueying couldn't bear it and turned around, putting on a stern face. Xiao Ji ignored her, looked her up and down, and smiled, "It's okay, but the powder on your nose isn't evenly applied. Watch me." As he spoke, he held up a small mirror in his left hand, picked up a powder puff from the powder box with his right hand, and randomly dabbed it on her face and nose. While applying the powder, he twisted his head left and right in front of the mirror. Although Yueying was very upset, she couldn't help but laugh. He didn't care, handing the mirror and powder puff to Yueying, and said with a smile, "Here, you do it." He casually wiped his face with the towel Yueying had used. Yueying held the powder puff in her hand, dumbfounded. Xiao Ji said, "What's wrong? Even out the powder on your face, and we can go!" Yueying looked back at Sister-in-law Hu, remaining silent. She thought, since she had applied the powder, she should apply it well. Be frivolous, be vulgar, it's better than starving to death anyway. So she learned from Xiao Ji, dipped the powder puff in powder, and dabbed it on her cheeks and the tip of her nose in front of the mirror. Xiao Ji nodded secretly and praised her. However, Yueying's heart was more painful than being cut by a knife. Perhaps not all women with faces full of rouge and powder are happy. (85)</p>
<h3>Bits and Pieces</h3>
<p>— (Xiong Yu)</p>
<p>Everyone knows the principle that being able to laugh out loud once a day is good for health. I alone say that being able to cry out loud once a day is even better than laughing.</p>
<p>For suppressed and magnanimous feelings that have no way to vent, and for those who want to laugh but cannot, a good cry will dispel all the pent-up emotions.</p>
<h3>Wang's Head and Feng's Arm</h3>
<p>— Holding Buddha</p>
<p>During the Spring Festival of the second year of the Republic, our principal, Feng Bingsou, along with Mr. Feng Sigong, Mr. Feng Fufu, and others, went to a desolate mound outside Beiguo in our hometown to pay their respects. I asked if this mound belonged to a talented but unappreciated scholar or a chaste woman of ice and jade, why did it inspire the local gentlemen to come and mourn?</p>
<p>It turned out that the mound did not contain an entire body, only an arm and a head. The head belonged to Mr. Wang, and the arm belonged to Mr. Feng. That's what my friend said.</p>
<p>Oh! So they are the tombs of two national heroes! Mr. Wang's name was Du'an, and Mr. Feng's name was Tanxi. They both followed Zhang Cangshui in resisting the Qing army and died for their country. Later generations only found an arm of Mr. Feng and a head of Mr. Wang. Pitying their loyalty and righteousness, they buried them together as a memorial. My friend said again, and then I understood.</p>
<p>When the Southern Capital was overthrown, Zhang Cangshui and Qian Sule, among others in our hometown, supported Prince Lu as regent. The loyal and righteous people's army repeatedly resisted the Qing army, which greatly frightened the Qing court. Later, Zhang Gong advised Zheng Yanping to take Nanjing, entering the river from Chongming, and they were victorious everywhere. Zhang Gong first moved his troops upstream, directly capturing Jiujiang, and the military power was very strong. Later, Yanping was defeated, and Prince Lu also died. Wang Du'an, who initiated the righteous cause with Zhang Gong, suddenly had a quarrel with his wife one day, scolding and arguing, causing a great uproar. As a result, he sent his wife back to her parents' home, severing their relationship forever. The neighbors were very surprised to see this, thinking that Mr. Wang was a righteous man, so why was he so unrighteous to his wife? They were all suspicious in their hearts.</p>
<p>Later, Zhang Cangshui scattered his troops and lived in seclusion on Zhoushan Island, where he was discovered by Qing soldiers and died unyielding. The two gentlemen, Wang and Feng, must have also died for their country, unlike Hong Chengchou and Qian Muzhai, who willingly became second-rate officials! After Mr. Wang was killed by the Qing army, his reason for resolutely divorcing his wife was finally understood.</p>
<h3>Wild Ducks</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>In the early winter evening, wild ducks flew in flocks across the gray and vast sky, their voices so clear and loud, resembling airplanes arranged in formation and moving forward.</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder, and they feel that the northern lands are harsh, cold, and hungry, so they have to laboriously flap their wings, hoping to survive. However, their lives are still lost in the hands of southern fishermen.</p>
<p>Wild ducks are on the market again. Fishermen's faces are filled with smiles, and even those who are not used to eating game want to taste some.</p>
<p>In my hometown of Dongshan, this season is the peak time for fishermen to catch wild ducks. There are hawkers who specialize in selling ducks. They buy at low prices and sell them to Suzhou and Shanghai. In Dongshan, they cost only a thousand or so cash per pair, but when sold outside, they are worth about a yuan per pair. The hawkers earn more profit than the fishermen with a single turnover.</p>
<p>In the reed ponds and shallow waters by Taihu Lake, fishermen each guard their territory, setting nets, pulling bows, and releasing a few wild ducks as "decoys." They stare with sharp eyes, gazing intently at the sky, waiting, waiting. When the flock of wild ducks arrives, they jerk the "decoy ducks" to make them call. The flying ducks hear the calls below and will fly down, throwing themselves into the net.</p>
<p>The nets are laid in the reed ponds. When the ducks fly into the net, the rope is pulled in, and they are rolled into the net one by one. The bow pullers insert a half bamboo pole into the mud, with each pole a zhang apart. The rope is tightly tied to the top of the pole, and the rope is tied in a loose circle. Another rope is used to pull the bamboo pole down. When the time comes, the rope that pulls the bamboo pole down is released, and the bamboo pole stands upright, trapping the heads, feet, and wings of the wild ducks. That's why only Dongshan has live wild ducks for sale.</p>
<p>There is also a type of wild duck called "Yangtze cargo." Most of the wild game sold in Shanghai comes from the Yangtze River. It is said that "Yangtze cargo" is not caught like Dongshan ducks. They use hunting guns to shoot them, or they mix poisonous powder with food and spread it on the beach. When the wild ducks fly to the beach to find food, they eat this poisonous food and die. Fishermen just go and pick them up in the morning. That's why they are not as fresh and delicious as Dongshan cargo.</p>
<h3>Resist!</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<h3>Temple Foundation and Field Frog</h3>
<p>— Ma Fosheng</p>
<p>Dried tofu, also known as fragrant dried tofu, is exceptionally delicious when eaten with peanuts, so it is also called vegetarian ham, and the price is very cheap. But the most exquisite production method belongs to Keqiao in Shaoxing. If you happen to pass by the stations of the Shao-Xiao Highway or the Hang-Jiang Railway, you will surely hear vendors shouting to sell Keqiao dried tofu. This can truly be worthy of the eight characters "cheap and good, famous all over the world" without any shame.</p>
<p>Speaking of Keqiao dried tofu, there is also a very funny anecdote, that is, the misunderstanding between "temple foundation" and "field frog." Originally, there was more than one store selling dried tofu in Keqiao, but among them, the most famous was the tofu shop in Dianji Lane. Therefore, out-of-town customers only knew about the dried tofu in Dianji Lane when they came to buy dried tofu, but forgot the name of the shop. Tracing back to the name of Dianji Lane, it was because there was originally a Zhang Shen Temple here. Later, it was unknown when the Zhang Shen Temple was destroyed, leaving only a temple foundation, so this lane was called Dianji Lane. (Now, not only is there no trace of the temple foundation, but even Dianji Lane is gone.) However, outsiders do not know the truth and mistakenly recognize "temple foundation" as "field frog"; moreover, they also embellish it with a rumor, saying: Keqiao Field Frog Lane is famous because there are many field frogs. This tofu shop catches the field frogs in the lane and boils them in soup as the juice for the dried tofu, so its dried tofu is particularly delicious, causing vegetarian old ladies to be suspicious and dare not eat it. Don't you think this is ridiculous?</p>
<h3>Records of Lingering Fragrance from the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After the Empress Dowager entered this palace courtyard, she suddenly seemed to lose consciousness. Her eyes were always staring straight ahead, and her walking was also very unnatural, as stiff as someone walking in a dream. But there were no tears on her cheeks. She just walked to a glass box on the left to look at it like she had lost her mind, and then turned to a box on the right to look at it; or she looked at it again once, twice, three times, even countless times. What made her especially embarrassed was that Xianfeng's relics were particularly few, not only could they not compare with Qianlong's, but they were also far behind those of other emperors of previous dynasties. It can be said to be the smallest part! Simply pitifully few! What is the reason for this? It's very simple to say. We people can be said to know everything. Or among the readers of this book, there are also many who understand. To put it simply, it is because this great emperor only knew how to enjoy himself during his lifetime. Gambling, drinking, almost all of them were his daily routines; in addition, in addition, there is no need to hide it, he also had a fondness for lust. If a person has so many bad habits, of course he can no longer be proficient in literary or martial arts; and the court affairs that he should handle are also completely abandoned. Strictly speaking, the reason why the Qing Dynasty declined and eventually perished, the first seed, may as well be said to have been sown by him. At least, no one can defend him, saying that he is not a昏君 (昏君: a fatuous and incompetent ruler) who has done nothing!</p>
<p>When we were visiting from the two palace courtyards in front, because we saw that the Empress Dowager was pointing east and west and talking very happily, everyone unconsciously forgot to be afraid and asked various questions, either directly asking her, or the two of them discussing with each other. The situation was very lively; but when we arrived here, we secretly glanced at her complexion and realized it was wrong, and quickly became aware of the situation. Everyone tried their best to endure and did not dare to say a word (195).</p>
<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3>Hibiscus and Papaya</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>(1) Hibiscus</p>
<p>"Having a woman in the same carriage, her face is like the hibiscus flower," which means that the hibiscus flower is a metaphor for the beauty of a woman. The hibiscus is a deciduous shrub, six or seven feet tall, with lush branches and leaves. It blooms from the turn of summer and autumn, and does not stop in winter. Therefore, Xu Ning has the sentence "Who says the hibiscus flower is born with a sense of haste, it is pitiful to count half a year of red." The flowers have several colors of red, white, purple and yellow, with five petals and short stalks like hollyhocks. The sunlight is shining, and it is suspected that flames are born, so it has the name of morning fungus. Other nicknames, such as Buddha Sang, Hibiscus, Jade Steaming, and Mu Ji are all. Or it is said that Shun Ying is a pure white and uninterrupted flower.</p>
<p>Flowers with double petals are better, single petals are only suitable for weaving into hedges, so they are named Hedge Hibiscus, the lowest of the flowers. It is said that when weaving a hedge, it must be inserted continuously without stopping. If it is done intermittently, it will be difficult to live. I don't know if it is true, it is really incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Hibiscus tender leaves can be used as a tea substitute. Tingzhou people in Min fry hibiscus flowers with noodles, so they call it noodle flowers. Also, Yu Chongzhi said: Pick red hibiscus, wrap yellow plums in leaves, pickle them in salt and dry them in the sun to recommend wine, so it is named Jade Xiu.</p>
<p>The red hibiscus in Lingnan blooms often from January to December, see Lingnan Exotic Objects, it is charming all year round, it is indeed lovely, is it because of the warm climate in the south?</p>
<p>There are not many hibiscus poems. Cui Daorong said: Hibiscus flowers are rarely seen, a new one every day. Yang Lingyun said: Towards the evening, they compete to dismiss the stamens, and the flowers bloom in the morning. Li Shangyin said: Deep red and fresh are mixed together, it is difficult to tell whether to cry or laugh. Yang Wanli said: The hedges are sparse along the road and piled up like brocade, blooming in the morning and falling in the evening and blooming again in the morning. What I have recorded is only this.</p>
<p>(2) Papaya</p>
<p>In addition to fragrant citron and Buddha's hand, papaya is also a clear offering in the study. Papaya is a deciduous shrub, six or seven feet tall, with flowers before leaves. The flowers are divided into red and white, which are beautiful and unusual. The fruit is elliptical in shape, the skin is yellow and looks like it is powdered, smaller than zhen 𣚛, and the fragrance is very strong.</p>
<p>Papaya is also called Mao, also called Iron Foot Plow. Fang and Sheng Lan said: When the papaya flowers are in bloom, there are snakes coiled around them. When the fruit falls, it is offered to the great bodhisattva and then they leave, so it is called the Guardian Holy Melon.</p>
<p>Xuanzhou is famous for producing papaya. Therefore, Qiu Jun's poem thanking for the gift of papaya has the sentence "The jade branches are sparse after frost and rain, except for Xuan City, there is nothing better." The ground is full of melon plants, and every time the fruit is formed, the good people carve paper flowers and stick them on the melon. The night dew and sunlight shine on them, and the flower patterns are vivid, named embroidered melon, also known as flower papaya. In the imperial era, it was often used as a tribute. In the past, Wang Yanzhang and Wang Fu were classmates in the Imperial College. Wang Fu was beautiful but empty, and Yanzhang called him flower papaya, which was a mockery.</p>
<p>Papaya can be planted or grafted, or pressed. Flowers bloom in late spring. If you transplant them, it is better to do it before and after the Autumn Festival. It is afraid of the sun and likes fertilizer, and if it is fertilized with dog dung, it will naturally flourish. The straight branches can be used as crutches. The elderly hold them, which is beneficial to the muscles and veins.</p>
<p>The method of storing papaya is to dry the papaya in the sun and put it in a sealed bottle, so that it can be fragrant for a long time without decay. Papaya tastes sour and astringent, but it can also be eaten. Miscellaneous Records of Emperor Ming: Empress Yuanxian thought of eating sour food, so Zhang Shuo offered a papaya in his sleeve. Cut the papaya raw and remove the skin, boil it thoroughly, change the water several times to soak it, so that the sour and astringent taste is removed, and then fry it with honey to make candied papaya. Also, papaya soaked in wine is also a good product.</p>
<p>If you roast the papaya into ash, the fish will die if they eat it. Abridged History of the Three Kingdoms: Qi Xiaozhao of the Northern Dynasty attacked Kumo Xi and reached Tianchi, using papaya ash to poison the fish.</p>

<h3>The Text of the Proposal Formally Announced at the First Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The National Vocational Education Discussion Meeting was held at the first plenary session on the 7th. The proposals passed have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, the text of the proposal formally announced at the conference is recorded below for reference.</p>
<p>1. Regarding how to supervise the implementation of vocational education laws and regulations and what suggestions are there.</p>
<p>The Fujian Education Bureau proposed "Please order various provinces and cities to pay special attention to agricultural teaching and practice in rural areas and rural primary schools as a supplement to promoting agricultural education."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau proposed, "It is proposed to reduce the burden on vocational school students and clearly stipulate the amount of fees paid by vocational school students."</p>
<p>The Anhui Education Bureau proposed, "The division of subjects in junior vocational schools should be as simple as possible in order to facilitate implementation and meet practical needs." The above three proposals were incorporated into this proposal for discussion.</p>
<p>Resolution: 1. It is hoped that various provinces and cities will supervise the implementation of the provisions on the establishment of departments, funding, equipment, and internships in vocational education laws and regulations.</p>
<p>2. If there are still vocational departments set up in existing middle schools, and if there is considerable equipment, teachers, and achievements, and it has been specially approved by the Ministry of Education, it can continue to exist and be regarded as a kind of experimental school. If the existing junior vocational schools are reorganized from junior high schools, and it is necessary to retain the junior high school class in fact, and it has been approved by the Ministry of Education, it may be temporarily allowed to set up a middle school class. As for the strengthening of agricultural subjects in rural normal schools and the increase of junior vocational schools, the education subjects are changed, and a small part of the curriculum should be accommodated.</p>
<p>3. The establishment of vocational schools should be based on a single subject. Departments of the same nature can set up more than two departments. If the school's economic, personnel, and equipment are all capable of setting up multiple departments, and it is necessary to set up them in fact, and it has been approved by the Ministry of Education, it can be established.</p>
<p>4. The fees paid by vocational school students should still be handled in accordance with the regulations. It is hoped that various provinces and cities will find ways to reward or subsidize private vocational schools with excellent results. Before private vocational schools receive public subsidies, and the fees paid by students exceed the number specified in the regulations, it may be accommodated after approval by the主管敎育行政機關 (zhǔ guǎn jiào yù xíng zhèng jī guān: responsible education administrative authority).</p>
<p>2. The case of short-term vocational training classes attached to senior vocational schools.</p>
<p>The Fujian Education Bureau proposed, "Please approve the establishment of special vocational courses attached to senior vocational schools in accordance with the methods of special normal courses attached to normal schools."</p>
<p>The Sichuan Education Bureau proposed, "Please ask the Ministry of Education to issue a notice to various provinces to set up agricultural instructor training classes as soon as possible to relieve rural areas and enrich production."</p>
<p>Representatives from Henan Province proposed, "Simple vocational schools should be established in the capital and various provinces and cities."</p>
<p>Representatives from Nanjing City proposed, "Vocational schools should be jointly run by junior and senior levels to suit the national conditions of our country, so as to enhance students' technical ability and forge them into sound vocational talents."</p>
<p>The above four proposals are attached to this proposal for discussion.</p>
<p>Resolution: 1. Various provinces and cities, depending on the needs of the local area, set up short-term vocational training classes attached to senior vocational schools for the sake of graduates' career paths. However, the agricultural and industrial departments should not be set up. For detailed methods, please ask the Ministry of Education to formulate and announce them separately.</p>
<p>2. The conference recommends that the Ministry of Education consult with various ministries and committees to order the agencies under the jurisdiction of various provinces and cities to consult with the local主管敎育行政機關 (zhǔ guǎn jiào yù xíng zhèng jī guān: responsible education administrative authority) when they need to run short-term training classes or seminars.</p>
<p>3. Various provinces and cities should consult with the local construction departments, finance departments, and other agencies before deciding to set up departments in vocational schools.</p>
<p>4. Industrial vocational schools should be jointly run by junior and senior levels.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Education Association Sends a Telegram to Chiang Kai-shek to Congratulate on the Victory Over the Communists</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Association sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang in Nanjing yesterday, saying: Nanjing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, The Red bandits have been rampant for several years, devastating the lives of the people, ruining the local areas, and the harm has been extremely great. Fortunately, under your personal supervision, and the officers and soldiers on the front line have given their lives to fight bravely against the bandits, their prestige has spread, and the bandits have been defeated. Now that Changting and Ruijin have been recovered one after another, the people of the three provinces of Jiangxi have seen the light of day again. The remaining bandits are like fish in a cauldron. The thorough elimination can be expected soon. The good news has come, and all the people are cheering. We respectfully send a telegram to congratulate you. Please observe. Huang Zaoxiong, Zhou Feicheng, and Weng Zhilong, Standing Directors of the Shanghai Education Association, kowtowed in unison.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Secondary School Federation Sends a Telegram</h3>
<p>Nanjing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, For years, the people of Jiangxi have suffered from the Communists. Although their strongholds are limited to a corner of the province, the loss of social vitality due to indiscriminate killing is by no means small. In addition, they are good at inciting the last skills, and some people were anesthetized last year. Fortunately, under your personal leadership and command, and the officers and soldiers on the front line fought bravely against the enemy, the bandit dens were finally broken and the total elimination is not far away. The good news spread to Shanghai, and all the people are delighted. We believe that the Communists often use ignorant people as their tools. At first, they are confused by the words of the bandits, and finally they fall into an irrevocable situation. In the future, to complete the work of suppressing the bandits, there is much to be done in education. As you have stipulated that special education should be implemented in the recovered bandit areas, this is indeed an important plan. We respectfully request that you forward the order to intensify the work, so that after the collapse of the Communists, there will never be a possibility of resurgence. We send a special telegram to congratulate you. We respectfully request your observation. The Shanghai Federation of Secondary School Teachers and Staff kowtowed.</p>

<h3>Unexpectedly, Youyou Lost to French Merchants</h3>
<p>Inaccurate Shooting Leads to Adverse Consequences</p>
<p>Result: One to Two</p>
<p>Youyou, who once defeated French merchants with a score of five to three, unexpectedly lost to French merchants by a score of one to two yesterday. This was completely unexpected. Youyou was very promising in the Scottish Cup, but unexpectedly lost it yesterday, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>Missed Opportunities Lead to Defeat</p>
<p>If one were to predict the outcome based on the situation of the day, one would have said that Youyou had a 60-70% chance of winning. Especially in the first half, for 45 minutes, Youyou's cavalry roamed around the enemy's goal for quite a while. However, because the shots were inaccurate, they often returned empty-handed despite having the mountain in sight. Fortunately, Sun Jinshun scored a goal in the 15th minute, allowing them to take the lead by one goal. In the second half, Youyou suffered misfortune from the start. The goal they conceded was almost inexplicable. Towards the end, when the game was about to end, Ma Shan'er, who had initially served as an inside defender and was later switched to left inside, deflected the ball into the net, which was especially saddening. It was a situation where victory was within reach, but they suffered defeat. This is a case of the one who could have won losing, and the one who could have lost winning.</p>
<p>Youyou Gains Possession Amidst Strong Momentum</p>
<p>Relying on a surge of energy, Youyou's five riders advanced together. The French merchants were not as strong as in the past, and did not have the imposing manner of rejecting people from a thousand miles away. In the blink of an eye, they passed three levels in a row, with the enemy's goal in sight. However, the shooting line was often blocked and forced to retreat. In the 15th minute, Sun Jinshun, Youyou's only accurate shooter, with the help of his teammates, avoided the opponent's obstruction and kicked the ball into the goal. Once the record was opened, the momentum became even stronger. However, there were still many opportunities lost, and the fault lies with Mei Hongbao. Youyou's failure to create a foundation for victory at that time was a foreshadowing of their later defeat. The first half ended with a score of one to zero in their favor.</p>
<p>Changing Strategy Leads to French Merchants' Victory</p>
<p>Youyou's misfortune seemed to come with the whistle that started the second half. Less than three minutes into the game, center Chen Zhenxiang suddenly touched the ball with his hand outside the penalty area, causing a great disaster. Remy was ordered to execute the penalty. In front of Youyou's goal, both sides, enemy and friend, monitored each other. The ball went towards the goal, and it is unknown who's back it hit, but it bounced into the net, creating a 1-1 tie. The French merchants, realizing that Youyou's attack was gradually weakening, suddenly changed their strategy, focusing on impact. Ma Shan'er had already switched positions with Da Wate, personally leading the three armies. As expected, in the last four minutes, Ma Shan'er fulfilled his wish and deflected the ball into the goal, and Youyou lost by a score of one to two. Their chances in the Scottish Cup ended from then on.</p>
<p>French Merchants</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>World Economic Panic and Chinese Currency</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Huang Xianzhang, Recorded by Chen Yiru</p>
<p>(1) Causes of the World Economic Panic—</p>
<p>(A) Internal Contradictions of Financial Capitalism: The main reason for this panic is, of course, the problem of the entire system. We must understand that in the current trend of financial capitalism, all efforts are made solely for its own interests: such as how to implement rationalized management? How to improve productivity? In short, the aim is to expand its own profit rate as much as possible. Therefore, under this financial capitalist organization, various industrial sectors engage in frenzied speculative competition, leading to an inability to maintain a balance between production and the general supply and demand of society. On one hand, overproduction is formed; on the other hand, the employed labor force, affected by overproduction, is squeezed out of factories, joining the ranks of the unemployed one by one. The panic of unemployment is spreading universally, forming a common phenomenon within various capitalist countries, circulating continuously without end.</p>
<p>(B) International Contradictions of Financial Capitalism: Due to the progress of production technology and the expansion of capital, the quantity and variety of products have also greatly increased. In the domestic market, they gradually stagnate, inevitably pushing exports outward to seek national prosperity. As a result, everyone tries their best to force exports and restrict imports: market competition is becoming increasingly fierce, and everyone adopts protective trade methods as a necessary means. In the end, everyone uses their national political territory as a boundary, squeezing out foreign goods, not allowing foreign goods to be freely imported, and international tariff wars and quantitative import restrictions arise accordingly. The circulation of goods is thus greatly hindered.</p>
<p>(C) Burden of War Debts and Reparations: After the World War, according to the Treaty of Versailles, Germany, in addition to losing territory and colonial possessions, had to compensate for all the losses suffered by ordinary people in all countries during the war. After several conferences and the formulation of various reparations plans, the so-called "standard year" was finally reached from 1924 to 1928. From then on, Germany had to pay 2.5 billion gold marks in reparations annually. However, Germany, exhausted from the war, how could it afford such a large amount of reparations? At the same time, because most European countries were debtors to the United States, most of Germany's reparations flowed to the United States. However, France received more reparations and paid less debt, so its financial situation was comparatively better than other European countries. As a result, a large amount of gold was concentrated in the United States and France. The following table lists the amount of gold reserves in the United States and France in September 1932 and the amount of gold reserves in various European countries (unit: millions):</p>
<p>United States September 1933: 4,190</p>
<p>France June 1932: 3,200</p>
<p>United Kingdom June 1932: 600</p>
<p>Germany June 1932: 196</p>
<p>Japan June 1932: 115</p>
<p>From the above table, we can see that the amount of gold reserves in the United States and France has reached a very large amount. In the United States and France, there is a panic of gold surplus, while in European countries, there is a lack of gold, resulting in currency tightening and a significant reduction in purchasing power.</p>
<p>(D) Reduction of Imports to Europe and the United States from the Soviet Union, Far Eastern Countries, and Various Colonies:</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet Union used to be an important market for various capitalist countries because it did not have industries as developed as those in advanced European capitalist countries, and almost all industrial manufactured goods relied on the supply from various capitalist countries. The various capitalist countries could transport their surplus goods to this huge, underdeveloped Soviet Union. However, after the success of the First Five-Year Plan, the situation changed drastically, almost unrecognizable compared to the past. The Soviet Union not only did not regard imports from various capitalist countries as necessary, but its own production of various industries sharply entered the market of world imperialism and competed fiercely with it. This is also a major reason for the reduction of European trade exports and the weakening of purchasing power in the Eastern market.</p>
<p>(2) The rural economy of Far Eastern countries, especially China, has suffered from the impact of foreign goods dumping over the years, resulting in extremely low prices for agricultural products. The rural economy will inevitably be exhausted day by day, with no way to recover. No matter how foreign goods flood the market, no matter how hard they try to dump them, there is no way to restore purchasing power. Moreover, most of the Far Eastern countries use silver dollars. After the sudden decline in 1928, due to the relative decline in the exchange rate of silver against gold standard currencies, the general purchasing power was greatly reduced, resulting in a reduction in the foreign exports of various capitalist countries.</p>
<p>2. Countermeasures of Various Countries to the World Economic Panic</p>
<p>The policies of various countries towards the economic panic cannot be exactly the same due to their different specific circumstances, but we can summarize them into the following five items:</p>
<p>A. Reducing production has almost become a common method for various financial capitalist countries. According to a 1932 survey by the German Landscape Research Institute, global production has been reduced by more than 30%.</p>
<p>B. Increasing protectionist tariffs and controlling international trade.</p>
<p>C. Abandoning the gold standard. The United States first banned gold exports and then abandoned the gold standard. The United Kingdom followed in the footsteps of the United States and immediately announced the abandonment of the gold standard, so as to compete with the United States in the international market.</p>
<p>D. Devaluing the currency and inflating the currency: For example, the new currency policy of the United States on January 25th this year. The measures taken by this currency policy are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Devaluation of the gold dollar by 40% to 50%.</p>
<p>(2) Gold is nationalized, not circulated, and not exchanged.</p>
<p>(3) The surplus gold obtained from devaluation is used to establish an exchange rate stabilization fund of 2 billion gold dollars.</p>
<p>The weight of each gold dollar in the United States was originally 25.8 grains, but now, after deducting 40%, or 940 grains, it becomes 15.237 grains!</p>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to raise prices, relieve debtors, and thereby encourage domestic production recovery, reduce unemployment, and alleviate financial panic.</p>
<p>E. Raising the price of silver (1) The Nine-Power Silver Agreement produced by the London Conference in 1933! Approved on April 1, 1934, and came into effect!! It stipulates that silver-producing countries purchase silver; restricts the sale of silver by silver-holding countries, namely India, Peru, Spain, etc.; restricts India to sell only an average of 35 million ounces of silver in 1934, and the total amount of silver sold within four years must not exceed 140 million ounces; restricts China from selling raw silver obtained from melting currency within four years, etc.</p>
<p>(2) The U.S. Silver Nationalization Policy, namely the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 on August 9, 1934, stipulates: (1) Set the basis for the monetary value of gold and silver at 75% gold. (3) The above silver may be purchased by the state, and the purchase price shall be set at no more than 50 cents per ounce for domestic silver. (4) Control the export or import of currency silver and other transactions. (5) Impose a 5% tax on silver transaction profits. (6) Issue silver certificates with silver as a reserve.</p>
<p>The above two facts, 1 and 2, are both aimed at raising the price of silver, hoping to thereby increase the purchasing power of silver-using countries. Looking at the above five methods, items C, D, and E all focus on the reform of the currency system. French economist Francis Delaisi and American Pittmon are both supporters of items D and E. French Truchy and Millard both opposed them from their own positions. For example, Truchy advocated restoring the original function of gold coins; Millard believed that currency devaluation and inflation are greatly harmful to workers, etc. They either argue from the perspective of their own country's interests or from the perspective of class interests, and we do not need to criticize them one by one. Now, let's talk with you about how currency devaluation in various countries and raising the price of silver affect Chinese currency.</p>
<p>(3) The Impact of Raising the Price of Silver on Chinese Currency</p>
<p>(A) First, in terms of the general economy:</p>
<p>(1) If the price of silver is raised, prices in China will inevitably fall, while in gold standard countries, gold coins will depreciate and prices will rise!!</p>
<p>(2) The exchange rate of Chinese currency will rise, and the exchange rate of foreign currency will fall - that is, forward exchange will rise and reverse exchange will fall!!</p>
<p>(3) Raising the price of silver is conducive to dumping foreign goods and unfavorable to China's exports.</p>
<p>(4) After the price of silver rises, it is unfavorable to international income calculated in gold coins and beneficial to expenditures calculated in gold coins; it is beneficial to income calculated in silver coins and unfavorable to expenditures calculated in silver coins. However, China's tariff revenue will inevitably decrease due to the high price of silver in terms of customs gold; and the remittances of overseas Chinese will also be further reduced due to the high price of silver. However, there are also benefits to raising the price of silver, such as repaying foreign debts, and the expenses of embassies and students can of course also be reduced by a considerable amount of silver coins. However, compared with the amount of imports, this benefit is truly insignificant.</p>
<p>(B) Specifically for China:</p>
<p>(1) China is a silver standard country and the head of the world's silver-using countries. The following table shows the average percentage of silver sales from 1928 to 1932, which shows China's relationship with silver.</p>
<p>Percentage of Sales Occupying Silver Production Percentage of Sales Occupying Silver Supply</p>
<p>China 40% 30%</p>
<p>India 32% 25%</p>
<p>Industry 21% 15%</p>
<p>Coinage 32% 25%</p>
<p>From the above table, we can see that raising the price of silver has a very significant impact on China. In principle, raising the price of silver increases the exchange rate of Chinese currency against foreign currencies, which seems to be very beneficial to China. In fact, this is not the case at all. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(2) After the price of silver rises abroad, China's silver reserves will inevitably flow out. The fact that more than 200 million yuan of Chinese silver coins have flowed out in the past three or four months proves this. The outflow of silver will lead to insufficient currency reserves in China, coupled with the reduction of remittances from overseas Chinese, the country will inevitably lack silver coins and will become a paper money world, which will inevitably lead to financial panic.</p>
<p>(3) Raising the price of silver, due to exchange rate relations, is conducive to the promotion of foreign goods and reduces China's exports, and imports will be even worse. Last year, imports exceeded 700 million yuan, and it is still unknown how it will end this year. Therefore, China's debt is increasing day by day, and it has no choice but to become more dependent on the economy of capitalist countries to survive. In other words, China will inevitably become more colonized.</p>
<p>(4) After the price of silver rises, the price of domestic copper coins will relatively fall, and the lives of ordinary people will be subjected to more severe oppression. Not only will there be a general reduction in purchasing power, but it will also further accelerate the bankruptcy of the rural economy, forming an unmanageable situation.</p>
<p>(4) How to Resolve China's Currency Crisis?</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned crisis, domestic people are very concerned about this currency panic problem. The solutions proposed by the general public can be roughly summarized into the following four points:</p>
<p>(A) Banning silver exports. This route is not feasible in China because there are extraterritoriality and foreign banks acting as speculators, and the government has no way to exercise the power of prohibition.</p>
<p>(B) Implementing the gold standard (such as the Kemmerer Plan) is also not feasible because China lacks gold coins.</p>
<p>(C) Levying taxes on silver exports and attaching methods to balance exchange rates. These two policies have been implemented by the government and are still a stopgap measure at the moment.</p>
<p>(D) Reforming the Currency System</p>
<p>(1) Reduce the cash reserve for paper money issuance to 40% in order to relatively inflate the currency.</p>
<p>(2) Improve the silver standard system, so that silver becomes a guarantee means domestically and a circulation means abroad, so that Chinese currency is separated from the world silver price. The method is to stop cashing out without prohibiting silver exports; secondly, adopt the method of "requiring importing merchants to present verification of goods to the central bank and purchase silver in full to offset the price of goods"—</p>
<p>See Zhou Bodi's article "Critique of the US Silver Policy," published in New China, Volume 2, Issue 17—</p>
<p>This is just an ideal, and even if it can be implemented, it may not be able to resolve our currency panic.</p>
<p>Conclusion: China's currency panic is the concrete manifestation of China's economic panic. Imperialism can use economic policies to alleviate its crisis, but China can absolutely not use currency policies to resolve the crisis of economic panic. The reason is:</p>
<p>The currency of rural China flows into cities, from cities into big cities, and then from big cities back into foreign countries, which is a continuous phenomenon. Because China's national capital is restricted by imperialism, and industries cannot develop, there are no adequate exports to offset this year after year of high imports, so a balance can never be achieved in international payments. If this continues, one day the people will be impoverished and the country will be bankrupt, becoming a country without gold and silver. Even if foreign countries transport gold and silver to China by way of investment, it is no different from falling further into the status of a colony, unable to extricate itself forever. Therefore, the current problem in China is that the panic caused by the price of silver is a small matter, and the economic panic caused by capitalist aggression is a big matter. Other countries can use economic policies to solve economic panic; only China must first start with political struggle to achieve the goal of resolving economic panic. There are many methods of political struggle, but at present, we believe that the whole country should have the following consistent common efforts, namely:</p>
<p>(1) Complete a unified and independent country;</p>
<p>(2) Organize a sound and powerful government;</p>
<p>(3) Implement planned economic construction;</p>
<p>(4) Implement a controlled policy of foreign trade.</p>
<h3>The Effect of Increased Silver Tax and the Surge in Foreign Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>The silver problem has now almost become a kind of "hot and cold disease" in China's currency system. Everyone feels the suffering of fever and chills, just like malaria patients, from the ups and downs of silver prices. Since April of this year, the continuous and large-scale outflow of silver reserves has made the Chinese people like startled birds. However, the increased export tax and equalization tax on silver have not been as miraculously effective as quinine. Recently, due to the soaring foreign exchange rates, and at the same time, reports in the newspapers have been spreading the news that unscrupulous merchants are still continuing to ship silver out of the country in secret. As a result, everyone is talking about it with fear, and panic-strickenly believing that the reason for the soaring foreign exchange rates is this. The soaring foreign exchange rates are indeed closely related to the extreme tightness of the silver market; and the large-scale export of silver in the past is indeed a major reason for the depletion of the silver market today, so it is indeed reasonable to say that the soaring foreign exchange rates are due to the continued export of silver. However, at present, at least in the current soaring of foreign exchange rates, there does not seem to be much connection between the two. However, the fact that silver can still escape is indeed a manifestation of the weak effect of the tax increase policy. The soaring foreign exchange rates in Shanghai are another matter. Heaven has its own reasons. It seems unnecessary to lump them together.</p>
<p>When the silver tax increase order was promulgated, the tide of silver outflow in Shanghai did seem to stop for a while; at the same time, records of inward movement did appear repeatedly in newspaper reports. As a result, everyone was happily thinking that the tax increase policy really had the effect of quinine, and everyone believed that from then on, silver could come to an end, and the rural finance of the interior could also have the hope of being rescued from its dire straits. In fact, the internal leakage of silver owes little to the power of the tax increase policy. The achievement that the tax increase policy can realistically achieve is, to exaggerate, only to temporarily cause some shocks in the international community, and to reduce the atmosphere of silver price soaring for about three weeks. To be honest, it only makes the open shipment of silver exports turn into secret or tricky shipment exports, and at the same time, at most, it opens another door of increased revenue for the state. What else can be gained?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the purpose of increasing the export tax and equalization tax on silver is to prevent the domestic outflow of silver reserves, and to avoid the complete bankruptcy of the domestic financial foundation. In fact, how much of the ownership of domestic silver reserves belongs to the Chinese people? At the same time, was there really sufficient legal tender collateral in the domestic financial foundation yesterday? Mr. Yang Yinpu is right to say that the inflow of domestic silver into foreign banks in China is no different from the outflow to London and New York. And the retention of silver in foreign banks in China or its transfer abroad is essentially the same. Fairbank also admitted in a fair manner that the large influx of silver into China in the past could not be regarded as an increase in China's silver base, it was just mostly for maritime "private storage." The extreme tightness of inland finance has fully indicated that China's financial foundation has long been empty. From this point of view, the contribution of the silver tax increase policy to the domestic currency problem was already minimal.</p>
<p>However, some people have said, and the government authorities have also said, that another main purpose of increasing the silver tax and adding the equalization tax is to declare the domestic silver price to be independent from the world silver market. Therefore, let the world silver market run wild, and our domestic silver price can always be hoped to be stable. If the domestic silver price can be stabilized, the commodity prices can be greatly hoped not to collapse again, and the farmers, merchants, and people will no longer suffer. In fact, European and American scholars no longer deeply believe that the terrible drop in prices in their own countries is entirely due to changes in the quantity of currency. Moreover, our country, which has no ability to independently control the price market; this kind of hope can at most be regarded as a kind of pious superstition.</p>
<p>The fact is very obvious that the main reason for the rise in domestic general prices this time - especially the price of staple food - is due to the global disaster this year. The development of military industry is also one of the main functions. Therefore, before the increase in silver tax, the domestic and foreign price markets had already shown this trend. After the tax increase, it happened to coincide with the reduction in autumn harvest results, which was manifested in fact. Due to the general public's concerns about the panic of food, the silver tax increase psychologically caused a temporary tense situation. Therefore, speculators in the exchange took advantage of the situation and created a rare activity in the agricultural product price market recently, and the result of this activity has a real connection with the boiling of the foreign exchange rate this time. The "cessation" of silver outflow and the beginning of internal leakage are also related to this.</p>
<p>The problem needs to be slightly analyzed to reveal the cause and effect.</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic rural areas have gone bankrupt, and cash has been concentrated in cities. At the same time, foreign goods have invaded and sold, and prices have been getting worse every day. Farmers, eager to raise money to make a living and pay off debts, have to harden their hearts and sell their agricultural products at low prices. The agricultural product price market is becoming increasingly depressed. Bankers in the city are suffering from a lack of investment avenues, so they are carrying out capital activities to the countryside in the name of saving the rural areas. In order to ensure the safe collection of their principal and interest, they concentrate on mortgage lending on agricultural products, and a considerable amount of agricultural products flows into the newly established large agricultural product warehouses. However, the pressure of imported agricultural products has not weakened slightly, so the domestic agricultural product market is still stagnant. By the grace of heaven, a drought demon came into the world; harvests in various places were poor, and panic rose suddenly. The prices of agricultural products that had fallen for a long time began to rise. At the same time, food merchants also showed their skills. Taking advantage of the farmers' urgent need for money, they made large purchases when prices rose slightly. I believe that at least three-quarters of the 4 million piculs of rice and grain stored in warehouses across the country today belong to landlords and merchants. Landlords and merchants have more money on hand and do not need to sell urgently; at the same time, because the famine has already formed, everyone is optimistic about the future (that is, the price of rice and grain will skyrocket in the spring when the green and yellow are not connected); therefore, everyone is waiting patiently. The arrival of goods in the Shanghai rice market is rare, and the market price will of course rise again; and precisely because the arrival of goods in the interior is scarce, the flow of funds is also slow. The recent sharp drop in foreign exchange rates is the reason for this. The foreign exchange market is determined by the rise and fall of commercial exchanges. In recent years, all industries have withered, industries have been depressed, and inland agricultural products have warehouses stationed; there is no need to rush to the city immediately. Therefore, the commercial exchanges between the city and the inland are light, and the flow of funds is slow; this has created a record of unprecedented decline in foreign exchange rates since this year. However, the autumn harvest this time is reflected in the sharp reduction in results. Therefore, the Shanghai rice price and miscellaneous grain market, as usual, will inevitably fall sharply under the killing price of unscrupulous merchants during the autumn harvest; but today, due to the above reasons, it still maintains its upward trend. This situation, on the one hand, allows inland landlords and merchants to sell their stored goods and replace them with new rice; in a transition, they can both adjust the current high-price profit first, and still maintain their hope of hoarding and reversing prices in the spring. At the same time, farmers who have been ruined by grain for years, seeing the activity in the market today, are also satisfied, and will transport their newly harvested goods to the city for sale. The rice merchants in the city, looking up with attention, - the landlords and merchants holding the same hope, all ask the question that the rice price is still firm when the autumn harvest is on the market, not to mention when the green and yellow are not connected in the spring, when the price is always soaring? It will inevitably be much larger than today. Why not absorb more spot goods as soon as possible to wait for the arrival of the God of Wealth. Each has its own heart, each has its own ambition, so the commercial relationship between the city and the interior is suddenly frequent. The flow of funds has also suddenly increased. The increase in the amount of bill exchange recently is proof of this. Since this exceptional situation has occurred, and at the moment Shanghai is in the busy financial season. In previous years, Shanghai cash also had the habit of being transferred out in large quantities due to the arrival of inland agricultural products. To sum up these factors, the Shanghai exchange market has greatly improved. According to the market yesterday (the 20th of this month), it has risen to a height of two dimes and two cents. It is a rare record in the past year. But after all, because of the famine, the arrival of goods is still not as large as in previous years, so the degree of commercial frequency and the amount of capital movement are difficult to reach the height of previous years. Therefore, the tension in foreign exchange rates can only be compared with the past two years to show its leap-forward momentum. If compared with the comparison of the 20s, it is still far behind. Today's panicked terror should not be here but in other questions, try to look at the changes in the Shanghai exchange market in the past four years to know.</p>
<p>The highest record of Shanghai's exchange market in the 20th year of the Republic of China was in October. At that time, it had opened a market price of six cents. In the 21st year, the top market time was in February, when the market price had reached seven cents. But then it collapsed; after October, it was pitiful to see that it was at a low of five or six cents. Since last year, it has usually been revolving around the highest one dime and the lowest white loan. Until November, it opened a record of one dime and eight cents; in December, it increased by another two cents to two dimes. However, once it entered this year, the old problem relapsed, and it was not until after August that it began to rise; it had opened a high price of one dime and five cents. It had opened a top market of one dime and six cents in September. But in early October, it returned to small, to be one dime and four cents; this market price of one dime and four cents is already the highest figure in this month. In the middle of the month and below, it has often stopped at six cents. At the beginning of this month, it rose again to one dime and one dime and two cents. It was not until after the 15th that it rose from one dime and three cents and one dime and five cents to one dime and eight cents; on the 19th, it rose to two dimes and one cent; on the 20th, it jumped to two dimes and two cents. It is also said that there are dark markets that make three or four dimes. But it is also said that although there are three or four dimes in the dark market, everyone is still less than trying. This situation does seem to be related to the depletion of the bottom. However, the depletion of the bottom is only the result of the continued outflow of silver; and the soaring of foreign exchange rates cannot be regarded as the result of the depletion of the bottom. However, I am not saying that there is no relationship between the two. I am just saying that the main driving force of the soaring foreign exchange rates this time is the result of the general speculators intensifying their squeeze on the countryside. Otherwise, why was the exchange market far less than it is today during the months of August, September and October when a large amount of silver flowed out? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Financial Foreign Exchange Rates Gradually Get on Track</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, which caused the foreign exchange market to appear sluggish again. Since the HSBC turmoil subsided, the market price of foreign exchange has gradually gone downstream, and there is a trend of gradually getting on track. Yesterday morning and afternoon, the market price was two dimes and one cent, which was two cents smaller than the previous day. The volume of exchange notes traded was more than 2.8 million in the morning market, and more than 200,000 new transactions. The afternoon market traded more than 500,000, and the small general meeting traded more than 300,000. The foreign collateral loan trading took back more than 900,000, and more than 700,000 new transactions were made. The money house foreign public bill received and solved more than 32.2 million, and the various remittance payments received and solved more than 400,000. Bank receipts and solutions were all at a standstill due to the holiday. Subsidiary currency was firm. The opening price of Jiangnan small foreign currency in the morning market once fell by three yuan, opening at 830 yuan. The afternoon market rose by six yuan due to the strong trading, making 836 yuan. As a result, it was still three yuan better than the previous day. The morning market made no transaction, and the afternoon market made 11,000 angles. The morning market of Guangdong small foreign currency made 770 yuan, which was already four yuan higher than the previous day. Unexpectedly, the afternoon market added another three yuan and five corners, making 773 yuan and five corners. As a result, it was seven yuan and five corners higher than the previous day. The morning market made 180,000 angles, and the afternoon market made 100,000 angles. The copper coin situation also improved, making 290,000 texts, which was 2,000 texts higher than the previous day.

<p>Securities The Bond Market Has Been Hovering for a Week</p>
<p>From December 3rd to 8th last week, the Chinese Business Securities Exchange was about to open the Fifth Plenary Session, that is, the more hope it had, the closer it got, and the market became brewing and hovering. The highest degree of foreign exchange has passed, and there is a trend of gradual decline. People's hearts are unanimously optimistic, and those who do more are very enthusiastic. However, because the silver market is still very tight, comparing the foreign exchange interest rate with the public bond interest rate,</p>
<p>it is still unprofitable. Therefore, those who do more have bought forward contracts one after another to avoid the crush of this month. The congestion of forward bulls is now in a deformed state where the forward and spot market prices are equal, and the hedge remains unchanged. The fundamental reason is still the tight silver market. The environmental situation is actually better than before. The bandit disaster has been eliminated, there is nothing wrong in North China, and the great unity between the Southwest and the Central Government is becoming more and more hopeful. If it were not for the silver market relationship, the market price would have soared long ago. Recently, due to rumors, it has turned tired slightly. The barriers between long and short positions have been built higher and higher last week. Foreign exchange has been looser than before, but it has not been able to give investors a favorable position. Foreign exchange loosened on Monday, and the bulls surged, rising by three or five corners. Foreign exchange continued to be small by three cents on Tuesday, and Huang Fu suddenly had a rumor of resignation. The whole was scattered in, and it was small by two corners to four and a half corners. The market was the clearest on Wednesday and fourth, and the trading was extremely sparse. It passed in a hovering and stagnant state, and the ups and downs were extremely small. Foreign exchange continued to fall on Friday, and the environmental news was even better. Retail investors' appetite was stronger, and it rose slightly by two or three corners. Political rumors suddenly rose on Saturday, and the market price fell by three, five corners to seven or eight corners. The result of the market price last week was slightly smaller by three or five corners. Ninety-six gold is long and steady, waiting for the opening of the Five Plenary Session today. This time has been delayed for a long time. During the period, mutual unity and contact, and the meeting should not be a problem. However, political views such as military, financial, and party issues are larger, or concessions are made in order to cooperate, or competitions are held in order to be properly handled. Therefore, during the conference, the news is enough to impact the market price, but its final result must be good, which can be predicted. The total number of transactions last week was 56,343,000 yuan, and the total number of existing accounts was about 55 million this month, more than 20 million next month, and 13 million ninety-six accounting, of which the short side was the largest at 5 million for numbers eleven and forty-eight. In the formation of other bonds, large short sellers are in the majority, and retail long sellers are in the majority. Sixteen, twenty-one, thirty-three, thirty-eight, fifty-three, and seventy-eight, etc., a total of twelve million shorts, the number of long positions is larger, only number three is 2 million, number fourteen is 2.5 million, and the rest are scattered in each household, mostly sporadic, so the future is quite volatile. The results of the gains and losses last week are compared and listed on the left, (unit yuan transaction unit 100 yuan)</p>

<h3>Current Situation of Tangshan Sanitary Facilities (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Deng Licheng</p>
<p>Medicine is the crystallization of science. With the evolution of science and the progress of society, it is constantly changing and gradually becoming refined. Therefore, its object is not only individual medical cases; the health of the entire society is its purpose. In today's developed health undertakings, medicine has shifted from passive disease treatment to active prevention, which is of great significance to the civilization, prosperity, strength of the entire nation, and the soundness of society. In recent years, China's health undertakings are budding, and civil medical and health facilities are particularly needed. I hereby present a compilation of my on-site investigation of the rural health conditions in Tangshan last month to satisfy the concerns of colleagues regarding China's health undertakings.</p>
<p>Tangshan is a town under the jurisdiction of Jiangning County, located sixty li outside Zhongshan Gate in Nanjing, at a crucial point on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. It is famous for its hot springs. With convenient transportation and excellent scenery, it is one of the famous scenic areas of the capital. It has a population of more than 20,000, scattered in more than 50 villages. There were no medical facilities in the town, and people lacked health knowledge, so they were at a loss during epidemics. In view of this, the National Health Administration established a health office in the town in the winter of the 20th year of the Republic of China to popularize medicine among the people and implement rural health. For the convenience of implementation, sixteen villages in the town were designated as rural health experimental areas to gradually promote it. At the beginning of the establishment of the health office, it only provided outpatient services. However, within a few months, it was crowded with patients and the work was busy. In order to expand, four flat houses were built in the west of the town in February of the following year, covering an area of more than four acres. It was completed in July, and the clinic was moved to the new site, expanding outpatient services and adding the following health works: (School health, maternal and child health, environmental health, disease prevention, health promotion, vital statistics. The organization, equipment, personnel, and work overview of the office are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Organization: The health office is directly under the jurisdiction of the National Health Administration and the Health Experiment Office of the National Economic Committee. This spring, Jiangning Autonomous Experimental County joined the cooperation, so it is also the Tangshan Health Center of Jiangning Autonomous Experimental County. However, the funding is provided by the National Health Administration.</p>
<p>(2) Personnel: One chief physician is responsible for medical affairs and designing various health works and other administrative affairs. One midwife is responsible for midwifery and prenatal and postnatal family visits and other maternal and child health works. Three public health nurses are responsible for outpatient patients, mobile medical care, and school health nurse work. In addition, there are two assistant staff members and three male and female workers.</p>
<p>(3) Equipment: (1) Examination room</p>
<p>(2) Pharmacy</p>
<p>(3) Dressing change room</p>
<p>(4) Outpatient waiting room</p>
<p>(5) Minor surgery room for outpatient prenatal examinations and other minor surgeries.</p>
<p>(6) Office for physicians, nurses, and midwives to work outside of outpatient hours.</p>
<p>(7) Exhibition room for displaying various health specimens, maternal and child health posters, health habit posters, children's health toys, etc., for public visits, and mother's meetings, children's meeting venues.</p>
<p>(4) Work Overview:</p>
<p>"A" Disease Treatment:</p>
<p>A. Outpatient Clinic: The outpatient hours are from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Regardless of whether it is sunny or rainy, there are more than 50 to 60 outpatient patients every day, most of whom suffer from gastrointestinal diseases, trachoma, acute conjunctivitis, skin diseases, minor surgery, and malaria. The initial consultation fee is only ten copper coins, and the follow-up consultation fee is five copper coins. Other medicines and surgical materials are free of charge. In addition, in February this year, there was an epidemic of epidemic meningitis in Shidi Village in the town, and more than 60 people were infected at one time. The health center opened a temporary ward for accommodation. At that time, more than 50 people were treated and fully recovered. The treatment method also involved injecting meningitis serum into the spinal cord.</p>
<p>B. Mobile Medical Care: In addition to outpatient disease treatment, one public health nurse is responsible for mobile medical care in villages far from the town every afternoon. The diseases treated are limited to skin diseases, trachoma, malaria, and surgical dressing changes. The medicines carried are mostly a few commonly used daily medicines. In case of critically ill patients, they should be sent to the health center for treatment immediately. I personally visited the mobile medical work with the nurse of the health center and felt that it was very necessary and valuable. Because most farmers are too busy with farming and are often unwilling to come to the health center for treatment for minor illnesses, resulting in serious illnesses. Mobile medical care meets the needs of farmers and achieves the greatest effect on health work.</p>
<h3>The Pathological Relationship between Teeth and Eyes in Oral Infections</h3>
<p>— Chen Ren</p>
<p>What is an oral infection? Oral infection comes from the English word "Focal infection". This name comes from the United States, because in recent years, research on pathological causes has discovered many systemic diseases, the cause of which is local pathology in the body, such as the teeth in the oral cavity, tonsils, or paranasal sinuses. The chronic pyogenic inflammation that occurs locally here does not present significant local symptoms, so everyone ignores it. However, this is a manufacturing site for toxic bacteria. From here, the toxic bacteria are distributed throughout the body, or other parts of the body, forming systemic diseases, such as toxemia, septicemia, or diseases in other parts of the body, such as kidney, myocarditis, endophthalmitis, etc. American doctors collectively call these infections caused by teeth, tonsils, or paranasal sinuses in the oral cavity Focal infection. Our translation of it as oral infection seems too narrow, as it also includes the paranasal sinuses.</p>
<p>We have many internal eye diseases, such as iridocyclitis, choroiditis, papillitis, glaucoma, etc., which are mostly metastatic. The paranasal sinuses and tonsils of the mouth occupy an important position as the source of metastasis, which doctors know. In recent years, after the discovery of dentogenic focal infection, ophthalmologists have also paid attention to teeth as the cause of metastatic internal eye diseases. At the same time, the close pathological relationship between teeth and eyes was also discovered. According to recent statistics, especially iridocyclitis, the infection from teeth also accounts for 1.2%.</p>
<p>If fashion is the nature of us humans, this phenomenon often occurs in the scientific community. For example, when a new theory comes out, it is often excessively promoted. After the theory that the cause of internal eye diseases is dental infection was announced, it was also highly valued and observed by scholars in general. We do not deny the theory of dental infection, and we admit that dental infection is very likely, because many metastatic eye diseases can be transferred from other places, such as the paranasal sinuses, so why can't they be caused by dental infection? However, the establishment of a theory cannot depend on its possibility, but must have its necessity. We cannot say that dental infection is possible; we must prove that dental infection is indeed a fact. The confirmation of this fact is the proof of this necessity, which is the basis for the establishment of this theory. In seeking the confirmation of necessity, we must also pay attention to what kind of dental disease is the cause of dental infection, and its relationship with eye diseases, so that we can obtain a correct statistical number from the theory of necessity. Based on this principle, we will examine and expand the theory of dental infection.</p>
<p>(2) To prove the necessity of a medical theory, two facts are required: (1) clinical experience, (2) animal experiments. So far, there have been no animal experiments on the theory of dental infection, because there is no experimental method, so there is no way to experiment. The theory of dental infection is entirely based on clinical experience. Now let us first investigate the clinical facts. For example, we have discovered an internal eye disease, and we should devote all our efforts to investigating the cause. Systemic examination and laboratory examination, we have not found any pathology. When we examine their oral cavity, we find that their teeth are not healthy. Can we admit the causal relationship between these two accidental, parallel facts? No! Absolutely not! Even if the number of such coincidences increases, even if we find that everyone with internal eye diseases has unhealthy teeth; at this time, we still cannot admit their absolute causal relationship. Because according to recent reports from dentistry, dental diseases can be said to be a civilization disease, which almost everyone in the city has. However, these dental disease sufferers do not all develop symptoms of dental infection. In large dental hospitals, there are thousands of dental patients and various dental disease sufferers every year, but no eye diseases have been seen. We go further and ask dentists to cure the teeth of internal eye disease sufferers and dental disease sufferers. If the internal eye disease is also cured as a result, then the necessity of this dental infection seems to be proven! Indeed, modern dental infection theory has statistics, all based on this principle. However, we must have a considerable certainty about the concept of "cure." Many internal eye diseases, especially iritis, are often prone to recurrence, and his recovery sometimes occurs suddenly and unexpectedly. Moreover, the extraction of the affected tooth, due to the bleeding of the wound and the decomposition of protein, causes a kind of stimulating treatment method, which often causes the disease to change and heal. Then, this treatment of dental disease and the cure of eye disease are all accidental, or non-specialized causal relationships, so we must observe secondary internal eye disease sufferers who are cured after dental disease treatment for one or two years or more to see if they will recur. If recurrence is still inevitable, then the original cause has not been removed and the root has not been cut off. The cure of this dental disease and the cure of internal eye disease are all accidental, not dental infection. On the contrary, after the dental disease is removed; the cause is eliminated, and the root is cut off, then there will be no recurrence, and the necessity of dental infection can be confirmed.</p>
<p>Only by such accurate clinical report summarization can a correct statistical number be obtained. However, when reviewing modern dental infection presidential reports, it is not noted or detailed whether there is an observation of more than one year on the point of sleep disease cure, and whether the patients in the statistics have no recurrence phenomenon at all.</p>
<p>(2) What kind of dental disease, or where the dental disease can cause dental infection? Researchers are sparing no effort. The route of dental infection is nothing more than metastasis through blood vessels or nerves. Therefore, external dental diseases that do not have a direct contact relationship with blood vessels and nerves have no possibility of metastasis at all.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>On the contrary, all chronic apical periodontitis, such as granuloma or cyst, which have a close relationship with blood vessels and nerves, are the key to dental infection. The discovery of these apical periodontitis must be done with X-ray fluoroscopy. Therefore, for internal eye diseases suspected of dental infection, X-ray fluoroscopy is an indispensable examination. As for periodontitis, because the pus has an exit, the possibility of its metastasis is naturally reduced, so scholars generally do not admit that it has dental infectivity. Simple caries that have not yet damaged the pulp also have no possibility of infection. If the caries have reached the pulp, then it is in direct contact with blood vessels and nerves, and there is a possibility of dental infection.</p>
<p>Since dental disease and dental infection have such a relationship, more attention should be paid to the statistical reports. So far, no record has been made of what kind of dental disease in all statistical reports. Does the so-called dental disease specifically refer to dental diseases that have the possibility of dental infection? Or all dental diseases? It is not possible to know for sure, so the statistical number is also unable to have scientific certainty.</p>
<p>The location of dental disease and dental infection of internal eye disease is also valuable. Is the relationship between dental disease of the upper jaw and eye disease closer than that of the lower jaw? Does dental disease on the left only have an infectious relationship with the left eye? These issues have not been noticed so far, so there are no detailed records in the statistics.</p>
<p>Since these two steps have not been effectively resolved, the theory of dental infection is still possible, not a necessary theory. Therefore, his statistical number is naturally not accurate. It is still necessary to unite countless ophthalmologists, internists, and dentists to jointly be responsible, jointly research, and jointly collect materials. Only in countless correct, detailed, and scientific materials, that is, in clinical experience, can a correct foundation for dental infection and a true statistical number be created.</p>
<p>Since joint research has a common goal, it must have a common method. I respectfully propose three chapters of the research charter, and please pay attention to them:</p>
<p>(1) Every internal eye disease sufferer must seek a detailed systemic examination, and X-ray fluoroscopy of the lungs is extremely important. At the same time, a dental examination must be done, and X-rays are also necessary.</p>
<p>(2) When a dentist encounters chronic apical periodontitis and other dental diseases that have the possibility of dental infection, they should ask if they have eye diseases or other internal diseases. It is best to ask experts to examine them in detail.</p>
<p>(3) Published records must be detailed. In particular, the records on teeth, such as the location of dental disease, the division of upper, lower, left, and right, what tooth and what disease, and the method of treatment, the more detailed the better, so that the theoretical confirmation is correct and has evidence.</p>
<p>The completion of this article owes much to the discussion with my friend Dr. Gu Hailing (Director of Medical Affairs of the Pediatric Dentistry Hospital). When I started the first draft, Dr. Gu happened to be ill. Dr. Gu's health was so good that he didn't care about it. Who knew that he would die after one illness, and passed away on November 11. I mourn the loss of my friend, and even more mourn the loss of a pillar of the new medical community that is under construction. I rushed to complete this article and respectfully dedicate it to the spirit of Dr. Gu, and silently pray that his spirit of serving the new medicine will never die!</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(47) Intestinal Cancer</p>
<p>(Question) Is cancer in the intestine like cancer in other parts of the body, mostly affecting the elderly?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes. Men over the age of forty are the most affected.</p>
<p>(Question) Where does intestinal cancer occur in the intestine?</p>
<p>(Answer) It occurs most often in the rectum; less often in the large and small intestines.</p>
<p>(Question) When do symptoms of rectal cancer begin to appear?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are no symptoms at the beginning; symptoms only begin to appear after two or three years. However, in young people with special constitutions, it progresses very quickly.</p>
<p>(Question) How does a patient with rectal cancer feel uncomfortable?</p>
<p>(Answer) At first, they often discharge mucus stools; which contain a small amount of blood; later, diarrhea occurs, and there is tenesmus. The sacrum has pressure, or the abdomen is full.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms if a patient with rectal cancer develops an ulcer?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is caused by friction of the feces causing ulceration of the mucous membrane. At this time, the mucus increases, accompanied by blood, and the urge to defecate is frequent.</p>
<p>(Question) Does the rectum become narrow? What are the symptoms?</p>
<p>(Answer) Cancerous tumors tend to harden and narrow the rectum. At this time, stubborn constipation occurs, and the feces form granules like rabbit feces. There is a feeling of pressure in the sacrum and a feeling of fullness in the abdomen, and there is a dull pain. Sometimes, symptoms of intestinal obstruction occur, or diarrhea and constipation alternate.</p>
<p>(Question) Is there any danger after ulceration or stenosis symptoms appear?</p>
<p>(Answer) The patient becomes acutely weak, or has symptoms of chronic sepsis.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the impact on the bladder and abdominal cavity?</p>
<p>(Answer) Rectal cancer can perforate into these parts and cause major bleeding. Very dangerous.</p>
<p>(Question) Where does colon cancer usually occur?</p>
<p>(Answer) It mostly occurs in the sigmoid part of the lowest segment of the colon. Second, in the cecum of the initial segment of the colon.</p>
<p>(Question) Does a person with colon cancer feel pain in the affected area?</p>
<p>(Answer) In the early stage, they feel almost nothing. When stenosis occurs, the intestinal tube above the stenosis is hyperactive, causing persistent colic.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the stool condition after colon cancer occurs?</p>
<p>(Answer) Mostly constipation, especially if stenosis occurs in the lower part of the colon, rabbit feces or strangulated feces will appear. If the colon cancer is in the upper part, diarrhea and constipation will alternate.</p>
<p>(Question) Does the patient vomit?</p>
<p>(Answer) If the stenosis is in the upper part, the intestinal contents will stay sooner or later. Acute intestinal obstruction occurs, leading to fecal vomiting.</p>
<p>(Question) Where does small intestinal cancer occur in the intestine?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is most common in the duodenum. But small intestinal cancer itself accounts for the least number of intestinal cancers. At this time, jaundice or diabetes may be caused by the pressure of the tumor. If it is in the jejunum, stenosis symptoms will occur, and there will be vomiting.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the treatment for intestinal cancer?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is no other way except early surgical resection. Radium therapy is just a comforting treatment and has little effect.</p>
<h3>Common Sense on Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(27) Real Fuli (commonly known as Diphtheria)</p>
<p>(2) Laryngeal Real Fuli Kehlkopfdjphtherie</p>
<p>Laryngeal Real Fuli is also known as Laryngeal Glub Kehlkopfkronp. It mostly follows Pharyngeal Real Fuli. It is the most severe and dangerous of the three types of Real Fuli. Children between the ages of two and seven are most likely to suffer from this type of Real Fuli. His main symptom is acute laryngeal stenosis. They are often in danger of life. This is because when suffering from laryngeal Real Fuli, the surface of the vocal cords is covered with fibrinous deposits (pseudomembrane). As a result, the entrance to the airway (glottis) is narrowed. Once the larynx is narrowed, it will cause difficulty breathing. If the difficulty in breathing reaches a high level, it is easy to suffocate and fall into a dangerous state. (To describe this danger in vulgar language, it is holding your breath). I will now briefly explain the process of laryngeal stenosis and its results. Readers and gentlemen, perhaps you can understand it more clearly.</p>
<p>At the beginning of laryngeal stenosis, hoarseness is felt. Glub cough occurs. This cough is an irritating cough. The sound is like a dog barking. An experienced doctor can infer from the sound that it is this disease. If the degree of stenosis increases further, dyspnea will occur. At this time, the pharynx is mostly also red and swollen. But the pseudomembrane does not necessarily have to be seen. The lymph nodes below and behind the mandible are painfully swollen. If a laryngoscope is used to examine the larynx, a grayish-white pseudomembrane is seen attached to the vocal cords and its surroundings. The swelling of the part is obvious, so the flow of air is of course obstructed. Although the body temperature rises, it is not necessary. It rarely exceeds 39 degrees Celsius. The pulse is significantly thin and rapid, and is often irregular. At this time, if a definitive diagnosis can be made early and appropriate treatment is given, it can usually be cured in a few days. Otherwise, if the opportunity for treatment is missed, various symptoms will proceed in order. The air passing through the glottis is more obstructed. Glub cough is also more severe. Dyspnea also reaches its extreme. The carbon dioxide in the blood increases, while the oxygen decreases. Therefore, the skin of the lips, tongue, cheeks, auricles, fingers, etc. loses the healthy skin's redness and turns lead-gray or purple. The patient's face shows an expression of pain. They move restlessly and toss and turn on the bed. The heart is also significantly weakened, and eventually they die of suffocation without rescue. Furthermore, the attack of Glub often occurs at night. It suddenly breaks through sleep and causes difficulty breathing. It suddenly falls into a state of suffocation. This is because the proliferation of Glub-like pseudomembrane during sleep covers the glottis and causes Glub. Sometimes, it can also cause the attack of Glub due to the accumulation of mucus or the adhesion of the edges of the vocal cords on both sides. However, the child can often eliminate this attack by spitting out the fibrinous pseudomembrane. This is nothing more than the glottis accidentally getting a chance to circulate air after spitting it out.</p>
<p>Looking at the process we have described above, the duration of laryngeal Real Fuli is often only one to three days. A week or so is rare. As for a long duration, that is an exception. His cause of death is mostly due to the result of suffocation caused by laryngeal stenosis. This is already a very clear fact. It is not necessary to mention it again.</p>
<p>The most common complications of laryngeal Real Fuli are tracheitis and tracheobronchial pneumonia.</p>
<h3>Common Fever Treatment Methods (11)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>If, after an illness, the body temperature is consistently lower than when healthy, for example, a body temperature of 97 degrees (or 37 degrees Celsius), one should delay returning to work. Furthermore, if the heartbeat becomes rapid after minimal exertion following an illness, this also indicates a need for a longer recovery period. One should continue to rest until fully recovered.</p>
<p>As one gradually recovers and reaches the point of being able to get out of bed, one should do so gradually, and not suddenly get up and walk around. If the fever was severe and the illness lasted for a long time, one should be especially careful and take it slowly when getting up. After a prolonged and serious illness, if the legs are weak, the first step is to gradually move the legs while still in bed. The method is to place a pillow at the foot of the bed and use the feet to push against the pillow as an exercise. Gradually doing this will strengthen the legs when getting out of bed. It is not advisable for a patient who has been bedridden for a long time to suddenly get out of bed. The first step is to sit up in bed with the back supported. Initially, sitting up in bed should be for a short period, once or twice a day is sufficient, and gradually increase the number of times and the length of time, as long as the patient does not feel tired. Further progress can be made by helping the patient sit in a chair, for a maximum of five minutes each time. Once in the morning and once in the evening is sufficient. The daily sitting time can be doubled in this way. After doing this for several days, one can help the patient walk around. When gradually moving around after an illness, it is essential to prevent the patient from fainting. Fainting is most likely to occur when the patient gets up quickly to relieve themselves. One should gradually acclimatize to excessively cold or hot environments after an illness. If financially feasible, taking a vacation for several weeks or months after an illness is also worthwhile.</p>
<p>Diet After an Illness As the patient gradually recovers, their appetite will also improve day by day. Be careful at this time not to let them eat too much or eat food that is difficult to digest. Do not base the diet on their appetite, but on the strength of their body. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid rushing to banquets or large meals immediately after recovery. Even the food that healthy people eat regularly should be avoided, and one should eat food that is particularly easy to digest. The most common mistake is to give patients food that they cannot digest or too much food that exceeds their digestive capacity. Indigestion caused by unsuitable food after an illness will hinder a quick recovery to health.</p>
<p>Tonics After an Illness A patient's body is naturally exhausted, anemic, and weak after an illness. Iron supplements to replenish blood, such as Blaud's pills, ferrous citrate, arsenic preparations, strychnine preparations, etc., are appropriate to take together with a suitable nourishing diet. By paying attention to personal hygiene and getting plenty of fresh air and sunlight, recovery to health can be expected soon.</p>
<p>Practical Treatment Methods</p>
<p>The various treatment methods for fever have been described in detail previously. Although the methods are available, the various fever conditions differ, and the treatment must be appropriate for each case. Here, the most notable types of fever illnesses are listed with a general treatment outline for reference by families.</p>
<p>(1) Typhoid Fever Typhoid fever is the most severe and aggressive of the fever illnesses. Hundreds of thousands of people die from this disease in our country every year. The formal period of high fever in typhoid lasts for about four weeks, and the entire fever lasts for more than a month and a half. Improper treatment is truly unspeakably dangerous. With improper treatment, at least three out of ten patients will die. Even with the latest treatment methods, at least ten percent will still die. This is truly a terrible disease. There is still no method to immediately cure typhoid fever completely, but treatment can reduce many of the dangers. The responsibility for treatment lies partly with the doctor and partly with the family. The family's responsibility is to implement the treatment methods prescribed by the doctor. Be sure to prevent the transmission of typhoid fever to others. Implement the prevention methods prescribed by the doctor. A brief description of several important treatments for typhoid fever is provided below.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (32)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 8 Clinical Examination Methods</p>
<p>C. Examination of Tubercle Bacilli This is the most important aspect of sputum examination. In the entire diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, there is nothing more accurate and important than the discovery of tubercle bacilli. Their shape and size have already been described in the first chapter, so it can be omitted here. In the sputum of patients with this disease, they are very numerous, especially in purulent sputum; this should be given special attention when collecting sputum for examination. During the examination, a staining procedure is required to clearly distinguish them from the various other components of the sputum; unlike elastic fibers and lung flukes, which can be recognized simply by placing them under a microscope. In ordinary staining, tubercle bacilli appear red, while everything else in the specimen is blue, making it easy to distinguish. If tubercle bacilli are found in the specimen, it is best to further investigate their quantity, commonly categorized into four levels: very few, few, many, and very many; this is naturally sufficient to indicate a general idea. The most accurate comparison involves dividing the quantity in one specimen into ten levels: the fewest being one to four bacilli in the entire specimen, gradually increasing to a few fields with only one bacillus, then one bacillus in one field, further increasing to several bacilli in one field, and so on until extremely numerous. This naturally requires a complete examination of the specimen. The more tubercle bacilli there are in the sputum over several months, the more severe the condition is, and the prognosis is also more dangerous; but this is not always the case, and there are sometimes exceptions.</p>
<p>Many people with this disease do not have tubercle bacilli in their sputum, which is the closed type of the disease mentioned earlier. Even if the sputum contains tubercle bacilli, the results may be greatly disappointing due to improper sputum collection or slight negligence in the staining procedure. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly examine several times to determine their presence or absence; hastily concluding that it is not this disease based on a single negative result is even more biased and will be ridiculed by experts.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>"Of all things useless, a scholar is the most"</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Huang Zhongze, a poet from Changzhou, had two lines of poetry expressing his complaints: "Nine out of ten people deserve scorn, of all things useless, a scholar is the most." The latter sentence may carry a hint of humility amidst the complaints, but the uselessness of scholars is true. Emperor Xuan of Han used legalist officials, and the Crown Prince (Emperor Yuan) said that the punishments were too severe and that Confucian scholars should be used. Emperor Xuan was displeased and said, "The Han family has its own system, originally combining the ways of the hegemon and the king. How can we rely solely on moral teachings and have the governance of the Zhou dynasty? Moreover, vulgar scholars do not understand the times, they like the old and dislike the new, confusing people with names and realities, not knowing what to adhere to, how can they be entrusted with responsibilities?" It is said that the emperors of the Han dynasty respected Confucianism, but look at what kind of useless things scholars were in their eyes!</p>
<p>At the same time, in another kind of community, scholars were also looked down upon. In the 71st chapter of Water Margin, after setting up new banners and assigning duties on Liangshan Marsh, there is a passage that describes the advantages of Liangshan Marsh:</p>
<p>"The eight directions share a city, different surnames are one family. Heaven and earth reveal the essence of the stellar fiends, the human realm combines the beauty of heroes. Thousands of miles away, they see each other morning and evening, a single heart shares life and death. Appearances and languages, north and south, east and west, though different; feelings, livers, and gallbladders, loyalty, sincerity, and righteousness are the same. Among them are imperial descendants, wealthy officials and generals, and people from all three teachings and nine streams, even hunters, fishermen, butchers, and executioners, all call each other brothers, without distinction between noble and base; and there are also siblings, married couples, uncles, nephews, in-laws, and followers, even enemies, all enjoy wine and feasts together, without regard to kinship. Whether clever or crude, rustic or romantic, they do not hinder each other, indeed sharing the same understanding; whether with pen and tongue, or knives and spears, or running and stealing, each has their own strengths, truly employing talents according to their abilities. What is hateful is the fake writing, reluctantly keeping a 'sacred-handed scholar' to preserve elegance; what is most annoying is the big turban, fortunately killing the 'white-robed scholar' first, washing away the sour stinginess. The area is four or five hundred miles, with one hundred and eight heroes; in the past, it was often said that the name was heard on the rivers and lakes, like the sound of an ancient tower bell spreading; today we know that surnames are listed among the stars, like beads on a rosary, each linked together. Chao Gai was afraid of daring to proclaim himself king, and returned to heaven early; only Song Jiang was willing to call on the crowd to protect righteousness, taking the stronghold as his head. Let's not talk about gathering in the mountains and forests, but wish to look up to the corridors and temples."</p>
<p>— Page 57 of chapter 71 of the 120-chapter version. The author of Water Margin was so at odds with scholars that he actually said: "What is hateful is the fake writing, reluctantly keeping a 'sacred-handed scholar' to preserve elegance; what is most annoying is the big turban, fortunately killing the 'white-robed scholar' first, washing away the sour stinginess." At first glance, one is quite indignant; but upon reflection, it is also the truth; in the eyes of the heroes of the rivers and lakes, the chivalrous men in the green forests, who puts scholars in their eyes!</p>
<p>Therefore, I picked up Wu Jingzi's The Scholars again and looked through it carefully; it is a book that most sincerely depicts the decline of scholars. If we link The Scholars with Water Margin, these two worlds have such an insurmountable wall! For example, Pan Sanye in The Scholars is not a particularly lovable or respectable character; but compared to Kuang Chaoren, he seems very great. When Kuang Chaoren was wandering in a foreign land with nowhere to return, Pan San did indeed make some money in the tricks of soliciting lawsuits, abducting women, and impersonating examinees, and even completed his marriage. When Kuang Chaoren passed the exam and became a tutor and son-in-law in the mansion of Li Gejian, Pan San hoped that he could help him out in prison; but Kuang Chaoren said with a stern face, "... I should have gone to see him in prison, but I am not like when I was a student; since I am doing things for the imperial court, I must abide by the court's rewards and punishments; if I go to such a place to see people, then the rewards and punishments will be unclear. ... What Pan Sange has done is what I would arrest him for if I were a local official; now I am going to see him in prison, am I saying that the court's punishment of him is wrong? This is not the way to be a subject." When we read Kuang Chaoren's corrupt words, it really gives us a headache. The most poignant thing in The Scholars is the old Mr. Ni who repairs musical instruments. He raised six sons, one died, and four were sold. He was even preparing to sell the youngest one. He complained to the actor Bao Wenqing, "... It's hard to tell you about the time! I entered school at the age of twenty, and now I have been a scholar for thirty-seven years. It's all because I read these dead books, unable to take light things and unable to bear heavy things; I become poorer day by day, and I have many children, so I have to make a living by this skill, which is a helpless thing. - To tell you the truth, I have six sons, one died, and now I only have the sixth youngest son at home; those four sons were all sold to other states and prefectures because there was nothing to eat! ... This youngest one will not be able to stay in the future, and will also be sold to others!" Only this kind of useless thing can create such a weak life. A young Russian woman, after reading Chekhov's novels, couldn't help but cry. She said: Are all these bleak lives and weak souls in Russia? The characters in The Scholars also make us feel this way. Wu Jingzi mentioned four ideal characters at the end of The Scholars: one who can write, one who sells firecracker tubes, one who runs a teahouse, and one who is a tailor; the tailor is the most perfect. He uses Jing Yuan's mouth to express his ideal proposition:</p>
<p>"I don't want to be a refined person, but I often study because my temperament is similar. As for our humble profession, it was left by my grandfather, does reading and writing and being a tailor become tainted? Moreover, those friends in the schools have different opinions, how can they associate with us? Now I earn six or seven cents of silver every day, eat my fill, and can play the zither and write, everything is up to me; I don't covet people's wealth, and I don't serve people's faces, heaven doesn't collect, and the earth doesn't care, isn't that happy?"</p>
<p>But this ideal character is still reclusive and fragile, only worthy of wearing a painted face and performing comedies. On Liangshan, at most it is just "reluctantly" and "to preserve elegance."</p>
<p>In Turgenev's famous work Rudin, Rudin leaves Natalia and leaves a self-blaming letter, saying: "My talent does not seem to be too thin, but my ability is insufficient, so I cannot achieve anything. Even if there is talent, it is useless, even if you sow seeds, there is no guarantee that there will be results. In me, there is no ability to move people, especially no ability to attract women. Relying on a little wisdom alone is useless. I want to stand up and do things enthusiastically, but in fact I cannot realize it at all; my destiny is truly pitiful and ridiculous!" Alas: "Of all things useless, a scholar is the most!"</p>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
<h3>The Red Light in Tangsang Cave</h3>
<p>— Shao Guanhua</p>
<p>Rain threads entwine mountain shadows,</p>
<p>Mountain shadows add to the grayness,</p>
<p>Mountain winds cut off sorrow,</p>
<p>Red lights blow up a smiling face.</p>
<p>Travelers feel joy, happiness;</p>
<p>However, the season has reached autumn,</p>
<p>Bearing fatigue, when</p>
<p>A wave of cold air throws up peach blossoms.</p>
<h3>Vera</h3>
<p>— Feier</p>
<p>Behind a row of old wooden houses arranged in a line, a long row of towering coconut trees cast shadows, making the houses unusually dark even during the day. In front is a flat dirt road. In dry weather, dust constantly rises; and in rainy weather, the mud sucks at people's footsteps.</p>
<p>Vera, this primitive village market, is connected to the Vera wilderness area in the back and lies horizontally in front of the Vera estuary. In the equatorial night world, gales carrying torrential rain constantly shake between the forests behind the houses, causing wild birds and beasts to wail and roar, and the wooden houses shake like an earthquake. During the daytime under the scorching sun, the Vera estuary constantly rises and falls with the tide, and the river rolls with the sound of the tide. Occasionally one or two small steamers pass through the river, the sound of the engines echoes on the riverbank, or the message of the arrival and departure of the steamer comes from the opposite side of Banian Port, the rest of the time Vera quietly lies in the silent breath of the countryside.</p>
<p>On this monotonous dirt road, Chinese people sit in small shops half-dozing doing business, Malays are gambling and chatting, children are playing foreign games, and workers are sunning "copra" all day long.</p>
<p>In front of the road, near the river bank, is a dirt square. Chinese people use bamboo woven things to buy coconuts from the hands of Malays, shell them and take the meat, and spread the coconut meat piece by piece on this place, ready to be dried into "copra". When the weather is good, Chinese workers squat on the square in the morning, patiently spreading the coconut meat in one or two hours. Under the scorching sun, when the tide rises, the riverbank echoes with the sound of Chinese and Malay natives calculating the number of coconuts, the sound of axes hitting coconuts, and the sound of hard objects shattering vibrates in the air.</p>
<p>The workers silently sweat working under a piece of leaves.</p>
<p>"Damn!" The worker uses a sharp digger to dig up the flesh in the shell. If he is careless, the digger hits his hand, and a small piece of flesh and a pile of blood fall from his hand, so the curse comes.</p>
<p>However, after the curse, he wraps a cloth around his hand, picks up the digger and continues to work.</p>
<p>What should be cursed most is rainy days. At that time, a black cloud flies over the sky, and the workers on the square are in turmoil, busy packing up their work. The "atta" leaves just cover the coconut meat, and their bodies have been soaked like they just came out of the river. Only when the coconut meat is dried into "dry" and loaded by the Royal Dutch Steamship Company, the work is considered to have been harvested, but at the same time other work products are piled up again. - Chinese people are always like this to make a small profit.</p>
<p>However, Vera suffocated in the price drop of "copra". The bosses shook their heads and sighed, but the workers were in the tide of unemployment, packing their bags under the wooden sticks of the police to return home. The Guangzhou craftsmen in the gold shops had already put away the shrines and incense burners written with red paper in front of the shops, and my Hehe Liang had to drop out of school and move with his gold-making father. Vera was locked in rows of shops, and the rats took the opportunity to breed and make noise in the houses.</p>
<p>As early as forty years ago, Vera was the location of the "palace" of the Vera chief and also the anchorage of ships. When the price of rubber rose, Banian Port, the estuary of the Banian River basin, which was rich in rubber, was established, so the ships changed their anchoring place, and the Vera king was forced to relocate. Today, the price of rubber has plummeted, and Banian and Vera are listlessly facing each other across the river, shrinking their hands in the recession.</p>
<p>No time is the rise and fall of the economy as fast as Nanyang, and no place is the rise and fall as unexpected as Vera. Vera, this quiet coast of the South China Sea, is a representative of a special example of the change in a deformed economic geography.</p>
<p>The last time I passed Vera, I saw that Vera City was about to die under the scorching sun. When I thought of He Liang leaving this birth place and crying to me in a foreign land, I felt a faint nostalgia for this gray old village city and a pathetic indignation towards the laborious and bleeding workers as if fighting against this world.</p>
<h3>A Process in My Creation</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Counting from the beginning of writing novels, it has been five or six years.</p>
<p>In the past, I was fascinated by the idea that "literary works are for people to pass the time," so what I wrote always revolved around fine wine, women - in a word, "enjoyment." However, immediately following the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese imperialist army trampled on my hometown, and the artillery fire of the Japanese imperialists in the "January 28th" Shanghai War destroyed the school I was studying in. This not only forced me to remotely receive the title of a slave of a lost province, but also lost my place to study and live in Shanghai. I was wandering, I was panicking, I was sad, I was angry, and finally, it aroused my emotions of resisting violence! "Wake up, can't you change the direction of your writing?" I woke up, I woke myself up from a drowsy dream and asked myself. "You should turn that kind of writing about leisure and elegance into a weapon to resist your enemies! For example: exposing the oppression, slaughter, and deception of our small nations by Japanese imperialism in the Northeast. At the same time, you should also grasp a certain point or level of the current society and say something that should be said."</p>
<p>Harvest Year - the three novels in this collection are the harvest after I woke up from my dream. They were written after I returned to the Northeast from Shanghai in September 1933 and returned to Shanghai in September, and were published successively in "New China" in 1934. The reason why I wanted to return to the Northeast was very simple, I just wanted to see if the ruined mountains and rivers of my hometown and the suffering of my compatriots under the iron hoofs of imperialism were the same as what we had heard in Shanghai. The facts later proved to me that they were different! Therefore, if there is anything commendable in the three pieces of things in this collection, the most important thing is their "truth." This is also the main theme of the content of the article.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the writing aspect, I was careful from the beginning, guarding against writing things that people could not understand. Because I myself am a victim of literary works of the kind that are deeply affected by the awkwardness of writing.</p>
<p>Saying that this is a preface is better than saying that it is a process in my creation over the years, but without this process, how can this collection be written. Then, this may not be a waste of words.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow (12)</h3>
<p>— (Joseph Conrad) translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>She exclaimed suddenly: "It's you! You yourself he's waiting for. It's you who's coming tomorrow."</p>
<p>He murmured. "Oh! It's me?" Completely stunned, they both seemed to stop breathing. Clearly he was pondering what he heard; then, though without anger, but very puzzled, he said: "I don't understand. I haven't written any letters or anything, it was my companion, he saw the newspaper, told me—just this morning ... oh, what else?"</p>
<p>He inclined his ear to her; she whispered quickly to him, he listened for a while, murmuring "yes," sometimes saying "I know," at last he asked "but why not today?"</p>
<p>"You don't understand me!" she said impatiently. The line of light in the west beneath the clouds was vanishing. He bent himself a little more forward to hear clearly, the darkening night covering up all of the whispering woman and the attentive man, except their faces brought intimately close, with an air of secret and tenderness.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders; the black shadow of a broad-brimmed hat sat picturesquely on his head. "These are so unpleasant, oh?" he complained to her. "Tomorrow?" Igh! igh! never heard such a thing spoken of. Why, all, so far as I can know, is tomorrow, and nothing has to do with today."</p>
<p>She still remained motionless, and did not speak a word.</p>
<p>"You perhaps encourage such ridiculous notions," he said.</p>
<p>"I have never gone against him."</p>
<p>"Why do you not?"</p>
<p>"Why should I?" she defended himself. "It would but make him unhappy. He perhaps would become out of his mind."</p>
<p>"Out of his mind!" he murmured, and heard a little nervous laugh from her.</p>
<p>"Where is the hurt done? Is it that I had a quarrel with the old fellow formerly? This I can easily believe to half extent."</p>
<p>"Oi, oi," he thought intelligently, "I fancy the old chap does deal always in his eloquent words with you. You are a good-hearted person."</p>
<p>Her two hands moved upward helplessly in the darkness. "That is perhaps all true. That is already true. That is already come. It is here. It is, we have been waiting for it, the tomorrow."</p>
<p>Correction: The article "On the Dian-Yue Road" published by this journal the day before yesterday has been completed. The "上" character in the title was mistakenly added with (), which may lead readers to believe that it has not been completed. This is a special correction, and readers are requested to pay attention.</p>

<h3>The Morbidity of Society</h3>
<p>— Home For</p>
<p>No one would deny it, right? In the historical process of continuous human evolution, various social organizations are produced. This is precisely because of the objective material and economic relations that affect and dominate, and present different social forms.</p>
<p>Take the law as an example: it is precisely one of the life forms in every society. Indeed, its purpose is to protect human beings, but it is created by human beings themselves; at the same time, it must vary with each different social and economic organization. However, if you violate or destroy the laws of the then-existing society, that is "committing a crime" and must be judged by the court.</p>
<p>However, the occurrence of various "criminal" events can essentially reflect the general form of social organization at that time.</p>
<p>Here, we must be convinced: the giant wheel of the times has turned to the teeth of this 20th century, and everything is unprecedented progress. However, we cannot fail to see that even in today's "civilized countries," the increasing complexity and surge of various "criminal" cases has become one of the serious morbidities in society, which is worrying and distressing many "sociologists" and even those specialized "criminologists."</p>
<p>As for Shanghai, which is known as the "New York of the East"—its appearance is so solemn and magnificent! Its progress is so rapid (!)—it is indeed worthy of our ordinary people's praise and nostalgia, right? However, it cannot be an exception, regardless of elegance or vulgarity. According to the recently published "October Crime Statistics" of the Public Concession's Bureau of Works, it is disappointing and alarming enough.</p>
<p>Look: the statistics of "criminal cases" in the Public Concession in October alone amounted to as many as 1,399 cases, an increase of 149 cases compared to September. Compared with the same period last year, there was a sudden increase of 204 cases. Among these cases, there were 877 theft cases, an increase of 176 cases compared to September. Compared with the same period last year, there was an increase of 171 cases. There has also been a sharp increase in various other cases.</p>
<p>Here, it is also reminiscent of a terrible thing: that is, the university student who graduated from XX University actually went to do that kind of sneaky, "shameless" business. But after all, "the law" is inescapable, "sentenced to four months in prison as a warning" (see the newspapers of November 21).</p>
<p>This time, the issue of the university student's crime has indeed attracted the attention of the general public in society, and various opinions have been expressed and the rights and wrongs have been examined.</p>
<p>However, it is a fact that students from prestigious universities have committed crimes by stealing. To put it more precisely: that is precisely a more powerful reflection of our general way of life today, and a more serious and concrete manifestation of the morbidity in this society!</p>
<p>Originally, the causes of various human criminal problems are very complex and detailed. If classified by those "criminology experts," there are objective, subjective, congenital, instinctive, accidental, professional, and so on. However, we can all see that in today's situation of "market depression" and "rural bankruptcy," coupled with unprecedented natural disasters and man-made calamities... then, the increasing surge of criminal cases and the increasing seriousness of social morbidity will never be so accidental and simple. It should be known that every social problem must first be affected and dominated by its objective material and economic relations! Nothing can be an exception!</p>

<h3>Anti-"Anti-Flattery"</h3>
<p>— Ma</p>
<p>"Anti-Flattery" are those who oppose "flattery," and Anti-"Anti-Flattery" are those who oppose "Anti-Flattery," and thus write about Anti-"Anti-Flattery." The other day I read Mr. Pi's article "Anti-Flattery" in Tan Yan, which on the surface seems agreeable, but in fact I strongly oppose it. This is because those who are good at "flattering" must be more agreeable and useful than those who are not good at "flattering." This is because those who are good at "flattering" can "anticipate the will," "report information," "shrug and smile flatteringly," and "pretend to be diligent," making it easy to win the master's favor. Therefore, as the saying goes, "a thousand wears and ten thousand wears, flattery never wears out." There is great truth in this.</p>
<p>Tang Wusansi often said, "I don't know what the world calls good people or bad people, but those who are good to me are good people, and those who are bad to me are bad people." These words are very straightforward, very easy to listen to, and very reasonable. Unfortunately, I don't have the qualifications to be a master, but if I did, I would be determined to use such people, because I hate strong-headed people who don't listen to gossip as soon as I see them. Therefore, "hawks and hounds," "slanderers," "claws and teeth," and "petty people" are the most necessary figures for the master's heart and soul.</p>
<p>Flattery is not only popular now, but also a very important historical trace in history. Let me give a few examples from history! There are many such historical traces in history, and I will give a few prominent examples:</p>
<p>During the Han Dynasty, the capital city asked Ping'en Marquis Xu Bo to enter the mansion, and when the wine was at its peak and the music was playing, Tan Changqing, the Shaofu of Changxin, got up and danced, performing a monkey fighting with a dog, which made everyone laugh.</p>
<p>During the Tang Dynasty, Lu Juan was a slave in the treasury, and when they gathered, they all held spittoons. Only Ku Rongguan spat into Juan's mouth, and he swallowed it all, saying, "I wish that the wisdom and fortune of the Lord would all enter my belly."</p>
<p>When Yang Zaisi was prime minister, he specialized in flattery to please the emperor. Zhang Tongxiu, the brother of Zhang Zhizhi, the Shaoqing of the ceremonial department, once teased Zaisi at a banquet, saying, "Yang Neishi's face looks like a Korean." Zaisi was delighted, cut paper and attached a turban, turned his purple robe backwards, and performed a Korean dance, which made everyone laugh.</p>
<p>When Duke Wei of Tang was ill, an official who was always flattering him came to the mansion to inquire about his health. He saw a chamber pot in front of the bed, picked it up and drank it. Duke Wei frowned and said, "Why do you do this?" He replied, "If the excrement is sweet, the disease is difficult to cure. Your excrement is not sweet, so it is easy to cure."</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, Han Tuozhou once toured the South Garden with a group of guests, passed by a mountain village, and wished for bamboo fences and thatched huts, saying, "This is truly the atmosphere of the countryside, but it lacks the crowing of chickens and the barking of dogs." Suddenly, he heard a dog barking in the thicket, and when he looked, it was Shi Duo. Tuozhou laughed loudly.</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, when Qin Hui was in power, Wang Lun presented a chamber pot made of seven treasures, engraved his name on the side, and wrote on the note, "Wang Lun respectfully presents this. In the past, the Han Emperor never forgot Ju Lu under every meal. I follow this intention and respectfully present a chamber pot, also wanting you to not forget it at all times."</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, when the eunuch Wang Zhen was in power, Wang You, the right vice minister of the Ministry of Works, was beautiful and beardless, and was good at observing Zhen's expression. One day, Wang Zhen asked, "Why does Minister Wang have no beard?" He replied, "How dare the son have what the master does not have."</p>
<p>After Yan Song was stripped of his office during the Ming Dynasty, his family was confiscated, and a white jade chamber pot was found, which was very exquisite. A gold medal was attached to the top, with the inscription "Zhao Wenhua respectfully presents." Later, Wenhua was impeached, and Wenhua said, "He wants to slander me, so he attached a gold medal to it." His flattery and cunning were like this.</p>
<p>The above are all historical traces of "flattery." No matter who you are, if you encounter characters like Tan Changqing, Yang Zaisi, Zhao Shiduo, Wang Lun, and Zhao Wenhua, and their "flattery" is applied completely, I ask you, is it comforting or not, is it pleasant or not? Therefore, I firmly and greatly oppose Mr. Pi's article on "flattery." This is because Mr. Pi may not have thought about the master at all? As for the intention of "flattery," I do not know, and should ask a few good flatterers.</p>
<h3>Sympathizer</h3>
<p>— Snow</p>
<h3>White Face</h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>In the jail, the whole day is filled with dullness in the dark atmosphere. More than a dozen people all feel suffocated and hope to run to the open space outside to take a breath of fresh air. Although the air in that open space may not be that good, it is filled with black coal smoke everywhere. However, to the people in the jail, the air there is simply better than the seaside in the morning. It is more joyful than being an immortal to be able to take a deep breath there.</p>
<p>Old Zhou, the big guy with the strange beard covering his lower cheeks, was the last one to come to this jail. But because he has too much beard, in just a few days, he has become more fierce than those who have lived here for more than ten days. He really looks like a prisoner. Because he is new here, the dark world and the dull air here simply suffocate him. All day long, he walks by the iron fence that is less than a丈 wide, like an old tiger that is accustomed to running in the deep mountains and is trapped in an iron cage for the first time. He sighs uncomfortably, frowning and not saying a word.</p>
<p>Today, the weather is a little warmer. Everyone got up early in the morning, and everyone rushed to the iron fence, reaching out to the bucket to fetch towels to wash their faces. Old Zhou got up a little late, and there was only half a bucket of water left in the bucket, and it had all turned black. He had no choice but to hold his towel and curse in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Damn, is this still water for washing your face? It's simply sewage from the gutter!"</p>
<p>"Sewage, isn't it good? This is still considered preferential treatment! Otherwise, there wouldn't even be this bit of sewage. Not to mention anything else, look at the more than a hundred people across the way! Aren't they still using the same bucket?"</p>
<p>Everyone in the jail knew that Old Tang liked to talk. Although he was already in his forties, he didn't feel anything because he was used to this kind of life. Every day, he just played around, told jokes, and talked happily. He was the only one doing it, as if he was the oldest person outside, but the youngest child when he came here. At this time, he looked at Old Zhou's situation and knew that he was feeling sad again, so he chimed in and said a few words.</p>
<p>Actually, he can't be blamed. People like Old Zhou, although they are already twenty-five or six years old this year, have never suffered a bit. They don't read much, and they always stay at home every day, playing with their big and small wives. He never dreamed that there would be such a place in the world, or that there would be people living this kind of life. Even for himself, he never dreamed that there would be a day when he would live in this kind of place. This time, entering this iron cage, he felt very strange, as if he was dreaming.</p>
<p>Today, the north wind is blowing very fiercely. In the iron cage, it is icy cold and there is not a bit of heat. More than a dozen people</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>are huddled together in a circle in the corner, with their heads tucked in. They can't see the morning sun. Only the biting cold wind blows on their faces, piercing the flesh inside their thin clothes. Their hands and feet are as cold as ice.</p>
<p>Tired, spiritless eyes are rolling in the dark corner, especially Old Zhou's big eyes, which are constantly rolling up and down.</p>
<p>"Hey! We are really too stupid. Look, isn't the sunlight shining into this cage? Let's go stand in the sunlight and see who is whiter.</p>
<p>It was about nine o'clock, and a ray of red sunlight was shining through the skylight. Although it was separated by a layer of iron bars, it seemed particularly bright in this dark jail. Old Tang seemed to have discovered something and became happy, calling everyone to stand in the sunlight and look at their bloodless faces.</p>
<p>More than a dozen people locked in the jail have not seen sunlight for ten or twenty days. Today, everyone is excited that the sunlight is shining into the cage, and everyone is standing in the sunlight to shine on themselves. However, the white faces that were not discovered in the darkness are now even paler in the sunlight.</p>
<p>Originally, everyone was happy, but now, everyone's brows are furrowed. Everyone is worried that their blood will dry up day by day, and when they leave the cage, they may not even have a trace of color left, leaving only a white face and a corpse-like body.</p>
<h3>Talk about Renting a House</h3>
<p>— Song Yuan</p>
<p>Once you arrive in this metropolis of the Orient - Shanghai, you think that there are new houses everywhere, and there are houses for rent in every alley. It doesn't matter, as long as there are enough banknotes in your wallet. In fact, finding a house is enough to make you angry. In other words, the problem of housing in the city is not so easy to solve.</p>
<p>Are you alone? A bachelor, that's even more troublesome. When you have chosen a clean and quiet alley, how comfortable it would be to live here, then you must be determined to rent a house here. However, the cleaner and quieter the alley, the more difficult it is to rent a house. When you look for red paper with black characters for rent everywhere, you will definitely be surprised; why are there no houses for rent here? If you are lucky enough to find a piece of paper for rent, knock on the door according to the address. The grandmothers and wives inside will lead you upstairs to see the house. The house has good light and air and is very clean. You will definitely be satisfied and want to talk to them about the rent. However, the first thing they ask you is, "Are you alone, or do you have a wife with you?" You will be stunned. You want to say "I am alone," then she sees you standing there stunned, and she will say to you first, "We don't rent to people without family members." She will also explain the reason, "There are many bad people in Shanghai..." putting you bachelor as a bad person and sending you out the back door. If you are lucky enough to find a house that says "Those with family members don't ask," it is some kind of club. You must think that you have found a house this time, and not having a wife is not a problem, but they want you to have a reliable shopkeeper to guarantee that you are a good person, not a bad person. If you can't find a reliable shopkeeper in Shanghai, then you have to admit that you are not a good person and don't fit in with what they are talking about.</p>
<p>You have hardened your heart about the houses in clean alleys, and you don't want to patronize them, then it will be easier to succeed. The easiest alleys to rent in are those where there are peddlers hawking, and it seems that the landlords are competing to pull in tenants. As soon as you enter the door, as long as the price is right, they are warm and kind, and even the children will call you uncle. However, as soon as you move your luggage and furniture in, the trouble will immediately come to you. Before your bed and table are arranged to your satisfaction, the landlady will immediately come to knock on the door. She is not here to congratulate you on your new home, but to ask you for rent with a smiling face. "There is a rule for renting a house in Shanghai, pay first and then live." If you want to discuss it with her, pay half of the rent first, it is best not to open your mouth, she will definitely not agree. Moreover, she thinks you are a fool who doesn't understand the rules of Shanghai, and she tells you a lot of things about renting a house, as if there have been regulations set long ago, and you don't even know these regulations. If you don't show that you are an old Shanghai person and know the old rules of renting a house, then her renting regulations will immediately change, and according to the rules, tenants should give notice ten days before leaving the house, and landlords should give tenants half a month's notice. She sees that you are an amateur, and she first takes care of you and says, "If you want to move out, you should give notice a month in advance." If you know the rules and argue with her, she will at most give in to half a month in advance, and in the end, she will sell you a favor and say, "Ten days is fine too. It's good for everyone to live here, it's better not to move." After you pay the rent first, she will also tell you, "Our lights are on until twelve o'clock at night, and the main door will be locked." She is not asking for your agreement, she is just notifying you. Also! As if she cares about your business very much, she calls you to go to the Public Security Bureau to report and register immediately, or you will be fined if you are a day late. If you don't understand these rules, or don't believe that there is such a thing, then she will first urge you with a lot of nice words, and later even get angry at you. "If you don't register, the Bureau will fine the landlord, I can't afford it!"</p>
<p>It's really troublesome to rent a house in Shanghai. Believe it or not, it's up to you.</p>

<p>Xinsheng (1380) 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Bao Yu Visits Xiaoxiang Pavilion at Night"</p>
<p>Severe winter frost forms ice. Moonlight hazy, about to fade. Gusts of north wind penetrate the bones. The Grand View Garden is desolate and deserted. Jia Baoyu walks along the flower street. Footsteps gently and slowly move. He is a lamp. A person. Dark shadows looming, even more melancholy. Alone to Xiaoxiang Pavilion. To see if Sister Lin's illness has lessened. Gently knocking on the copper ring, a rattling sound. Ziyun the maid is busy opening the door. Saying, Second Master, you should be careful in the cold late at night. Sister, I am worried about your girl Lin. Especially came to ask if you are well. Arrived at the right of the sickbed. Only to see her breathing weakly and without a sound. One called Sister Lin. One called Cousin. Her almond eyes slightly opened, tears streaming down. Saying, Brother, my Second Sister-in-law should not treat me like this. Although the Old Ancestor loves me dearly. But alas, she is deaf and blind and not sensitive. My illness cannot be cured. And I cannot ask for leave every day to ask for peace. Brother, my debts from the previous life with you are paid off in this life. Please, noble son, do not care about this ill-fated person. Sister, your life is always full of worries. Why do you think so little of yourself? Think of anything you want to say. You and I are of one mind. I advise you to eat three meals a day. I advise you to add more clothes and be careful. I advise you to take care of yourself by first taking care of your heart. Why bother looking for troubles yourself? I advise you not to listen to the words of the sisters. They are like false and like true. I advise you to rest early and not stay up late. It is not good to grind on till dusk when you are sick. I advise you to put aside all your worries. And don't think about the old Su Zhou wall door. Daiyu nodded secretly. Brother's words I keep in my heart. The heart turns dark. Even more sad. The nemesis is most caring for me. Tears cannot stop flowing. Saturating the fragrant silk scarf. This life may not be too drifting.</p>
<h3>Zhou Jianhong Big Red Robe</h3>
<p>Central-West (1040) 11:45 AM to 12:30 PM Opening: "Xue Jian"</p>
<p>All his life, a famous official guarded the southern border.  His sleeves were filled with integrity, and his pouch with poems.  Government was simple, punishment was light, nothing much to do.  He was ashamed to fawn over superiors like common officials.  In his later years, he lamented not having a son like Bodao.  But he had a daughter before him to comfort him like Zhonglang.  Beautifully raised in the inner chambers, still awaiting marriage.  It's a pity that time has passed, and a suitable husband hasn't been chosen.  He hired a famous teacher, Chen Zuiliang.  A desk was set up in the inner courtyard to teach the red-dressed girl.  The virtuous young lady, with her maid, Xiaomei Xiang, respectfully bowed and entered the hall.  The female student was treated like a son.  Morning and evening, they lectured on poetry.  The young maid accompanying her in studies was small.  Several times she offended the aged teacher.  Disobedience to the teacher's instructions cannot be forgiven.  Taking the cane for a painful beating is only right.  Fortunately, the young lady is good at covering up mistakes.  From now on, she must not be so reckless.  Fetching a Lin Jin calligraphy copy and bringing a writing set.  Her floral-style handwriting is unparalleled.  The teacher pretends to recite the Pa Jing classic.  When he gets to the "Guan Ju" poem, Li Niang suddenly feels a pang of sadness.  For no reason, the words "a gentleman's good pursuit" come to mind.  The Kan hexagram foreshadows this fate.  Silently, she returns to her room.  Feeling utterly dejected on her orchid bed.</p>

Lu Qian was so frightened that he hid in the yamen, afraid to come out.  Lin Chong waited for three days but didn't see Lu Qian.  He had no choice but to return home and sit in sullen silence.

Director Huang took Yuru's photo and went to his friend Li Shaoan to be a matchmaker. Who would have thought that the person Shaoan found for Yuru was the very person Yuru yearned for day and night, and also Luo Xia's ideal man, Jiang Qiuwu.</p>

<p>Ode to Peonies by Ms. Wang Bingmei</p>
<p>Beside the Peony Pavilion, brocade clouds piled high, peony blossoms set off by verdant moss.</p>
<p>Flowers bloom like brocade, their beauty radiant, a woman leans on carved railings, smiling openly.</p>
<p>The spring light is bright, the spring breeze fragrant, cherishing spring, yet there's the sorrow of Du Wei Niang.</p>
<p>The days are long, with nothing to do but watch the flowers, tiny golden lotuses tap along the corridor.</p>
<p>Murmuring, a pair of swallows, once acquainted, bees and butterflies flutter, vying for the wind.</p>
<p>The fragrance of clothes and flowers intermingle, dark, shiny hair brushes against the clouds.</p>
<p>A celestial maiden scattering flowers, her spirit dancing, her clothes woven with brocade, an embroidered skirt.</p>
<p>The embroidered skirt and silk stockings, a new outfit, a slender waist and snow-white neck, naturally perfect.</p>
<p>Like a flower, like jade, also like a fairy, loving flowers as if her life depended on it, burning candles high.</p>
<p>Instructing the maidservants to carefully protect them, cherishing the flowers, rising early and sleeping late.</p>
<p>Jade branches and jade leaves, covered in golden gauze, light clouds and gentle breezes beside Phoenix Pond.</p>
<p>Wishing the flowers always beautiful, the moon always full, wishing my beauty rivals the flowers.</p>
<p>Wealth and elegance surpassing all others, verdant youth that never changes.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor, In the Wireless Radio column of the News Evening Post on the 4th of this month, a letter clarifying matters was published by Wu Huilin, Dong Ruiqing, Ji Shiying, Li Dongliang, Mi Mian, Gao Xinzhi, and other gentlemen. After reading it, I was extremely shocked. The Shanghai Feige Society is solely organized and managed by Shou Xun personally, as has been proven by lawyers Wang Yintai and Zheng Wenkai. When Feige Society previously broadcasted singing on radio stations such as Central-West, Fuxinghua, Huamei, and China, Wu Huilin and the others were all employees hired by Shou Xun. Furthermore, Wu and the others have now formed the Xingguang Society, naturally severing all ties with our Feige Society. Now, Shou Xun is also engaged in other occupations, and the broadcasting work of the Feige Society has been temporarily suspended. Apart from Shou Xun personally and Ms. Cang Yinqiu, who are currently collaborating with the Shanghai Wireless Drama Society, there are no other radio broadcasts. Therefore, henceforth, no matter who uses the name of Feige Society to make contact for any matters, it has nothing to do with Shou Xun. For this reason, I am taking advantage of a corner of your esteemed publication to issue a solemn statement. This is to the Radio Editorial Department of Shen Bao. Respectfully submitted, Wang Shou Xun of Shanghai Feige Society (Seal) December 9th</p>

<h3>Carole Lombard's Peculiar Sense of Humor</h3>
<p>— Li Bin</p>
<p>The life of Hollywood's beautiful star Carole Lombard is simply a continuous stream of jokes. She was practically born to laugh. Her abundant sense of humor finds its only outlet in teasing people or playing pranks. As the ancients said, "Why not engage in some frivolous activities to spend one's limited life?" Lombard deeply understands this principle. Her daily life and that of her friends are almost entirely devoted to finding jokes and having a good time. As the old saying goes, "Birds of a feather flock together; those of the same mind resonate with each other." Since Carole Lombard is like this, the group of friends who gather around her are naturally of the same kind. If you can't stand her jokes, you simply shouldn't befriend her. If you are too sensitive and can't withstand her teasing, you shouldn't even see her. But if you have a sense of humor equal to hers, then you will find her endlessly amusing and full of laughter.</p>
<p>For example, which Hollywood star would be willing to have someone burst into laughter during the most romantic scene, or have everyone remain silent while watching their comedy, or have several friends laugh and walk away when they are singing their best? The above is what happened to the famous singer Bing Crosby himself. It was at a theater on Catalina Island, during the screening of Bing Crosby's latest musical film, that Carole Lombard suddenly led a group of friends in. She said she was there to congratulate Bing Crosby on his success, but her method of congratulation was too peculiar. But Bing Crosby is also a great guy with a sense of humor no less abundant than Carole's. He knew Carole was there to make fun of him, so when she led a group of friends out with loud laughter, he chased after her, shouting behind her, "Wait for me! I'll go with you!" He also followed Carole to have some fun. Of course, Bing Crosby knew that Carole was making fun of him, but how many Hollywood stars can withstand this kind of public prank?</p>
<p>This was not the first time Carole Lombard and Bing Crosby played pranks on each other. One day, director Norman Taurog led a large group of people on his private yacht to scout locations and take a break. Everyone had agreed beforehand to bring some food to treat their friends. Bing Crosby happened to forget to bring anything and ran to the yacht empty-handed. Everyone knew that Bing Crosby was known for being forgetful. This time, he probably forgot, and they said he was a Jew who wouldn't spend money. She pestered Bing until he had no choice but to promise that he would treat everyone to champagne as soon as the ship docked. But later, when they arrived at Catalina Island, they still didn't have any champagne to drink. Clearly, Bing Crosby had already forgotten again. The next day, while Bing was filming, he suddenly received a telegram. He opened it and saw only the word "Now" written on it. He knew Carole was joking with him again. He just laughed it off. Unexpectedly, fifteen minutes later, while filming was in full swing, he received another telegram. He opened it and it was also the word "Now" written on a blank piece of paper. He just laughed it off again. Ten minutes later, he received another telegram, with the same word "Now" inside. Five minutes later, there was another telegram. From then on, a telegram arrived every minute. This made Bing Crosby flustered and unable to concentrate on filming. Finally, he realized that he hadn't fulfilled his promise of champagne to everyone. So he immediately ordered champagne. Sure enough, as soon as the champagne arrived, the telegrams stopped coming. But he had already received more than fifty telegrams. Of course, the telegram fees were all charged to Bing Crosby's account.</p>
<p>Of course, specializing in teasing people also has its own risks. Carole Lombard herself admitted that she had been tricked by director Norman Taurog. She still laughs when she talks about it. Norman had recently made a film that used a large bear. But the bear's training was not very good. By the time the film was finished, he was covered in sweat. From then on, he not only didn't want to see the bear again, but he didn't want to hear the name of the bear mentioned. Carole Lombard heard this and deliberately got a big bear, put it in a large wooden box, and had someone send it to Norman's house at night when he was about to go to sleep. Norman was very angry when he saw the big bear Carole sent him. Later, he thought, since she wants to trick him, why not think of a way to resist. He thought for a long time, then his brow furrowed, and an idea came to him. He immediately ordered someone to call the animal farm and have the bear put in a car and taken to the animal farm, saying that it was Carole Lombard's treasure and should be carefully cared for. He also had a special and exquisite room built for the bear, and all the expenses were to be paid by Carole. Unexpectedly, the big bear got sick as soon as it arrived at the animal farm, so he specially hired a famous veterinarian and used round-the-clock nursing to treat the bear for several months and cure its illness. He then drove the bear back to Carole's house and attached a bill for rearing and medical expenses. This time, she suffered a loss of several thousand dollars. But Carole laughed out loud when she was tricked herself.</p>
<p>Of course, the above words are not entirely without meaning. Foreigners say that Chinese people have no sense of humor at all. They get angry and lose their temper at the slightest provocation. Theaters and taverns are supposed to be places for fun, but they often encounter scolding and fighting. After reading this article, one will understand the principle of "knowing fun and being happy," and not just making oneself suffer.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Lady by Choice"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Lady by Choice - Cathay</p>
<p>After the old actress May Robson, she performed in this work that was enough to give full play to her acting skills. Coupled with Carole Lombard's strong and individual acting skills, "Lady by Choice" can satisfy people in terms of acting. But it is a pity that the excellent acting skills are built on a fantasy story. Because the story is not a representation of reality, the result is that excellent acting skills are only equal to waste, because everything in the play does not give people a real emotion.</p>
<p>What is the theme of the play? A young girl who disregards morality and often violates criminal laws should be combined with a young man who loves her wholeheartedly. In order to achieve this theme, the playwright makes a wandering old woman become a dignified and noble lady after her life is satisfied, not drinking, not making trouble, and using herself as a model for young girls. Such a persuasive effect is unnecessary to say.</p>
<p>Perhaps people think that a dancer's publicist uses the dancer's arrest or solicitation of a mother as top-notch publicity material; it's quite light and interesting, but this has no other effect other than to combine young boys and girls.</p>
<p>After watching this film, we feel that May Robson's acting is extremely good, but other aspects do not give us a deeper impression. The first half is very light, lively, and interesting. Director David Burton did handle these places very successfully, but in the second half, it gradually fell into stagnation and dullness.</p>
<p>There is nothing else to say.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Regarding the performance of "The Goddess"</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>After I finished watching the film "The Goddess," I felt that this new playwright has great hope for the future. Of course, he has already given us some good impressions in this initial debut work.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, here we can see that the playwright already has a considerable understanding of the current society, although his subjective views still need to be discussed.</p>
<p>No matter what, "The Goddess" is a very realistic expression in terms of subject matter. Although this is just a simple story, it has very smoothly developed the social and ethical tragedy; a woman sells her body and soul for the sake of her beloved son; and in order to make her child grow up and improve, she is willing to give the money she earns from selling smiles to her child to study; but the snobbish educator wants to investigate the profession of her parents. How can she answer this? In the end, the child cannot get the opportunity to be educated, and the embarrassing mockery makes her very sad!</p>
<p>The rogue forcibly occupies a private prostitute. Due to the control of the environment, she has no choice but to endure the cold treatment and the ruthless trampling and is subdued under the iron hooves of the devil's lust, but in the end, she can no longer bear it and is sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment!</p>
<p>"This is a social problem," I believe no one will deny this. The playwright has correctly grasped this, and under his clever analysis, he emphatically developed it through the old principal's narrative. This subtle technique is really commendable.</p>
<p>Speaking of the director, there are also many new gains, such as (1) taking Ruan Lingyu and Li Keng from Zhang Zhizhi's crotch to express being subdued, (2) the re-shooting of Ruan Lingyu in Zhang Zhizhi's palm, illustrating that she cannot escape his control, (3) Ruan Lingyu's trial in court and the transformation of the prison scene, etc., are all rare successes. In addition, the narration of the whole play is also very concise and clear; however, the blandness of the climax part seems to lack consideration.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Ruan Lingyu's expression of double personality is very powerful, and Li Keng's acting talent will naturally not disappoint us. Zhang Zhizhi looks like a typical "playboy," and Li Junpan is also quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>Finally, we are looking forward to Mr. Wu making greater contributions in the second time and meeting us.</p>
<h3>A Bunch of Tianyi News</h3>
<p>— Bai Yun</p>
<p>Set designer Zhou Hekang specially remodeled a prison car with a truck for filming "Model Youth," which is no different from a court prison car.</p>
<p>The sound film "Model Youth" is scheduled to shoot a scene in front of a dance hall today, and the set is extremely grand and magnificent.</p>
<p>"Baihuazhou" is one of Tianyi's new films, starring Chen Yumei, Ye Qiuxin, Yu Guang, and Chen Qixia. It is said that it has been scheduled to be screened at the Carlton Grand Theater this month.</p>
<p>Wang Pingling's "Spring in Zijin Mountain" is now in preparation.</p>
<p>"Red Mansion Spring Deep" has been screened at the Far East Grand Theater in Changsha, Hunan for more than a week, and it is full every day. (Actually)</p>
<h3>Correction of Letters</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I read the December 5th</p>
<p>Your publication published a news item about the capital air defense exercise news film produced by Yihua Company, which is quite different from the facts. After investigation, this time, our stock was ordered to rush from Gan to Beijing to shoot various exercise situations to create a public air defense education film for our stock's patrol and projection team to project in the mainland and in the army's rural areas. Because the number of photographers in our stock was insufficient, we specially telegraphed Comrade Yuan Congmei, director of our stock, to temporarily hire. Then, directors Shi Dongshan and Zheng Yingshi and photographers Zhou Ke and Wang Yang of Yihua Company enthusiastically supported and participated in this work together. All materials and reception expenses were borne by our stock. Matters related to national defense are not the same as ordinary news that can be freely obtained. The duty of our stock lies in this, and we specially send a letter to clarify, and hope to correct it. I wish you good health.</p>
<p>Political Training Office of the Chairman of the Military Committee, Nanchang Military Camp, Film Share, December Day</p>
<p>The above news was printed on publicity materials by Yihua Company. Since it is inconsistent with the facts, it is hereby corrected. Editor Bai</p>

<h3>Mother and Daughter's Fate (Lady by Choice) (8)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Jia</p>
<p>When Alabama heard Johnny say that he would rather give up his family fortune to marry her, she burst into tears of joy and said, "You are a young man with millions of dollars, and you are willing to give up your family fortune for me, but can you promise me that you will live a poor life in the future?" Johnny laughed and shouted, "We will be as poor as beggars in the future. We earn money and spend it all. When we are old, we will move to a nursing home. This is what comes from my conscience." After he finished speaking, he hugged Alabama and kissed her wildly. At this time, Alabama was already happy and dreamy. She was like going to a fairyland she had visited before, where she had dreamed of when she was a little girl, long before she changed her personality. That dream is now reappearing before her. The next day, Alabama suddenly received a call from Judge Darting to ask her to come. She immediately ran to the judge's place. The judge looked at her and felt a little strange. He had a relationship with this feather fan dance expert, but now the god of fate has brought her to him again. A few months ago, she was arrested for nude dancing and released by her. Now, outside of her duties, she wants to have some negotiations with this woman, because two people have come to ask her to help interfere with this woman's behavior. One is Johnny's mother, and the other is Pansy. After listening to their statements, she felt that their views were correct. Now she saw this woman standing in front of her, and when she mentioned Johnny's name, her eyes were almost tearful. When she advised her not to marry Johnny, her lips trembled in fear. When she told her that she would ruin Johnny's entire future, she could see the pain in her heart. But she also thought that she was an actress, or she might be performing for her. But in the end, she listened to Judge Darting's advice and agreed not to marry Johnny. When Alabama withdrew, she saw Pansy in the room again. When Pansy saw Alabama, she went up and hugged her and kissed her lips. Alabama also became happy. Pansy also knew that Alabama had changed, so when Alabama asked her to go back together, they went together. But from then on, Alabama's eyes and lips no longer showed her smile, and she trembled when the phone rang. She refused to see Johnny and didn't even talk to him. When Pansy saw this scene, she remembered that there was a girl who cried all night for love. She was also so sad, just because she wanted to do a reasonable thing and forget her lover, and the voice and smile of that lover were exactly the same as Johnny now. Where did that girl go then? Later, she became an old and frail Pansy. She remembered everything she had experienced before, how could she bear to watch Alabama repeat her mistakes. Later, Alabama went to her former manager Kendall to restore her feather fan dance life. This time, Pansy couldn't bear it anymore. She ran to Johnny and told him everything that had happened to Alabama recently. So Johnny and Pansy immediately ran to Judge Darting's place again. That night, the place where Alabama was dancing was surrounded by the police again, and Alabama was arrested. After Alabama was arrested, she laughed wildly. Of course, it was not a happy and licentious laugh, but her laughter was filled with the infinite pain in her heart and the hatred for life. She was brought before the judge, and she still laughed coldly. The judge pretended to be calm and said, "Arrested again, right? This time I'm going to execute the previous announcement of the situation. What do you have to say?" Alabama sneered, "Just execute it. No one is stopping you." Johnny heard this and suddenly stepped forward and hugged her and said, "No, baby. There is still one way to go, and that is for you to marry me. Otherwise······" Alabama exclaimed in surprise, "You!" She wanted to persuade him not to be infatuated, so as not to hinder his future, but she couldn't open her mouth, because Johnny's lips had already sealed her mouth, because Pansy and the judge were also looking at them and smiling at each other.
