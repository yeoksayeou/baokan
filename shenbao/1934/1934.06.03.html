<h3 id="c14">國際局勢之動向與遠東問題 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>今日足以引起二次世界大戰之火藥庫。一在遠東。一在歐西。在遠東者以中日問題爲核心。而以有關遠東利益之英美俄法爲副角。在歐西者以法德爲重心。而以英俄意波小恊約巴爾幹諸國爲副角此數國中旣關切遠東問題而又不能不兼顧歐西問題者。當推英俄。英國屬地遍全球。嚴格言之。非一純粹歐洲性之國家。其在印度洋太平洋間之領土。如印度。馬萊半島。北婆羅洲。以及澳洲紐蘭。皆與不列順帝國之存亡。有莫大之關係。自不能偏重歐陸問題而忽略遠東。蘇俄地跨歐亞兩洲。東西皆有黷武國家之威脅。故其國策亦不能偏重於一面。而况在日德默契之今日乎。英俄之地位如此。故上述東西二大火藥庫。或有先後一併爆發演爲世界空前大混戰之虞。</p>
<p>此種局勢。今已日趨明顯。就最近國際政治之發展而觀。可以逆覩者。凡有數點。㈠爲俄法之結合。已成事實。俄之所以出此一着。非僅以之防德。實所以對日。法之所以出此一着。雖其主要之動機。在於對德。然間接亦必至形成同時對日之局面。於是日德爲一集團。俄法亦爲一集團。日俄而戰。可以誘發法德之戰。法德而戰。日俄亦有捲入漩渦之虞。</p>
<p>㈡爲英法之關係。日趨隔閡。英於德之希脫拉。雖嘗一度表示厭惡。然其所厭惡者。寧以獨裁政治爲對象。英人爲駕馭法國計。仍非扶助德人不可。今法既聯俄。則其扶德抑法之計。自必大爲减色因是而加深英德親善。或使英日關係。略形好轉。皆爲可能之事。蓋英若有事於西。則其東方屬地之防衛。恐難兼顧。事前非得日本之善意諒解。殆有寢饋雖安之感。前此西門外相曲解九國公約。不願露骨抨擊日本者。無非欲在英日商戰聲中留一與日轉團之餘地。惟英人而出於袒日一途。遠東之局面。必將發生重大之變化。屆時遠東問題之處置。當惟日本之馬首是瞻。美國能否單獨出塲。裁制日本。將成絶大疑問。日人若無英美之牽制。更可放膽聯德以對俄。日俄戰禍之醞釀將因是而益臻成熟。殆無可疑。</p>
<p>以上所言。爲吾人依據國際大勢而推測之結果。雖不中。亦必不遠。有人以</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3 id="c195">怎樣寫日記—答王載甫君— <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>王君來信，詢及怎樣寫日記的問題，他說，每當提律寫日記的時候，總感到没有什麽可寫，因而懷疑到寫日記在修學上的效用。要解答這問題，第一我們必須加强王君對於寫日記的信心，其次是尋出他的所以遭遇到困難的原因。</p>
<p>寫日記，在讀書的過程上，有着極重要的作用，這是凡稍有讀書經騐的人，均應該承認的。它一面可以訓練寫作的技能，一面可以使自已思想逐漸展開，而同時，假使把它作爲生活的紀錄看，更足以鼓勵自已，鞭策自已走向自已應該走的前途。</p>
<p>我們知道，平常一般人寫文章時，自已的筆尖，是不能隨意揮動的，這不僅是因爲題材的束縛，而且因爲文章是寫給别人看的，在措辭造句上，往往要費極大的周折。以致造成不是作者使用文字，倒是文字驅使作者的現象，造成文字與内容判然分開原現象。這一來，在實際上，辭旣不能達意，甚至足以把眞實的感情思想掩没，而在作者，勢不能不把寫作視爲難途。所以古人說：「文章本天成，」部份的是根據這情形而發的。這對於初學的人，無論在文字技術上，或思想上，欲求進步，實在非常之難。然而寫日記却完全可以打破這一切！</p>
<p>寫日記，是極其自由的，是全憑作者自由發輝的。它的内容，便是作者全部生活的内容。它是最能養成作者把文字技巧統一在内容以内的東西。它給予作者長期練習文字技巧的機會，却不使作者受絲毫文字上的束縛。當然，我們的態度是嚴肅的，但我們絶不需要任何顧慮和虚飾。文字欠通，是不要緊的，思想幼稚也是不要緊的；我們根本不是寫給别人看，而是寫給自已看；訓練自已，檢閱自已；把自已每天的生活，作一番整理，經一番洗練。這樣的繼續下去，思想能有不發達的嗎？有有條理的思想，才有淸順的文字，寫日記，必然是初學者訓練頭腦和文字技能的最好方法。</p>
<p>然而王君爲什麽每於寫日記時，總要感到没有什麽可寫呢？我們以爲，王君之所以遭遇到　困難，不外如下的原因：</p>
<p>第一，把寫日記僅當成練習文字技巧的東西。没有打破視寫作爲畏途的觀念，以致經常苦於辭句的搜索，而對於日常生活反而置若無睹，或者不敢把自已認爲平凡的生活内容運到筆尖上來。這些都是錯誤的！我們絶不相信，一個現代的人，會没有可紀錄的生活。王君是一個商店學徒，那麽，王君所接觸的人，是很複雜的，所經歷的事，也决不會簡單，這些不都是日記的材料嗎？這些材料不够王君使用嗎？但王君畢竟没有什麽可寫者，乃是王君一提起筆來，便把全部注意力放到文字使用上去，時時懷着文字不够用的恐慌，於是感到寫「這」旣不好，寫「那」又不能，而結果只有讓許多材料，從筆下溜去。王君一定讀過些名人日記，以爲他們的日記均是一字一珠的了不起的著作，其實不然，他們賣的，並不是原封未動的貨色，而是修裝過了的贋品。「這些」，是値不得模倣的，更不應該因此而嚇退自已。</p>
<p>其次，是把日記的内容限於個人的私生活方面，進一步說，就是使自已的私生活從社會隔離開來。這樣，日記不啻成爲個人的起居注，而寫時，除掉幾點鐘起床，幾點鐘睡覺，大小便幾次，吃飯幾碗等等刻板的生活外，自然要感到無事可記了。我們爲什麽要這樣呢？我們難道不能把視綫展開嗎？我們的生活固然平凡，無多大變化，但我們日常所見所聞，以及從書本上，從報紙上，從朋友談話中，不是很可獲取無窮的新材料？我們儘可以從極細微的問題，發揮我們自已的意見和感想，無論我們的意見對與不對。你看到一個巡捕打黄包車夫，是不是要發生感想？你看到一個呌化子向商店討錢，是不是要發生感想？如果這樣，你的日記題材，實在是取之不盡用之不竭，怎麽還會感到没有什麽可寫呢？</p>
<p>最後，是把日記當成吃飯一樣刻板的事情做。當然，寫日記是最能鼓勵人去反省自已，認識社會的，因爲不這樣，便眞要没有什麽可寫，而且也無意義。但反過來，我們却不能過於機械地處理它，應該給它以多量的自由。如果某一天我們眞的没有値得可寫的東西——没有自已眞實的感情，没有自已眞實的意見，我們便直截了當不要寫，用不着去造作，用不着寫些吃飯睡覺的事來敷衍，這是完全没有益處的。不然的話，在一個較長期的歷程上，你必然要感到艱澀，感到無聊·而對寫日記發生厭惡。</p>
<p>根據如上的說明，我們誠懇地希望，如王君一樣初學寫日記的讀者們，一定要記住：在技術方面，須養成想寫什麽便寫什麽和有話卽長無話卽短的習慣，絶不應拘拘於措辭造句，以致妨碍思想的發展，在内容方面，應該從個人的生活解放出來，而把環繞着你的四周的事物，甚至整個社會生活，當成日記的材料。這樣，寫時旣不致發生文字上的阻碍，想也决不會再　遇着没有什麽可寫的困難吧。不知王君以爲然否？</p>

<h3 id="c246">怎樣去讀書？ <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>據我的調查，八歲以下的孩子，不大懂得保護書籍；大致在八歲心上的孩子，他們很珍貴他們的書籍了。他們賣了一册新書，每小心地以紙包了一個簿面，小心翼翼地不敢損汚一些，翻閱起來，也謹愼得很。這種愛護書籍的態度，我們實在無可訾議，我們函應提倡的。</p>
<p>可是，小朋友們要明白，愛護書籍是，讀書是一事，不要爲了愛護書籍，而妨礙了讀書。這話怎樣講呢？譬如說：讀到生字，則不妨在生字的帝邊劃一條綫，不要爲了要汚損書籍而不劃。須知劃了綫，對於讀書的方法方面，多少有些助力，書籍究屬給人們讀的，不是供裝飾的，愛護畢竟是小節。所以我勸小朋友們，在讀書有三件事可以行得：第一件是在生字的旁邊劃線，以便計算每天生字認得有多少，並可知讀書興認生字的增减比率；第二件是將自已認爲愛好的句子，或意義重要的句子，加以圈點，一方可以表明這一篇已經讀過，一方看起來，更可一目了然；第三件這是要年長而讀書多的兒童，才有能力辦，若然讀到某處，有些意見，不妨在書的上端，加以眉批，至於意見的對不對，可以不去管他；因爲思想的錯誤，自有敎師會來校正的。</p>
<p>末了，我還重提一遍：不要爲了愛護書籍，而妨礙了讀書。</p>

<p>嗡，嗡，嗡，枝頭花縫，糾緾着不少的小東西。它們忙碌地鑽進花間，平張着翅，挺伸着喙，盡力地像吸吮甚麽似的。忽地又　的一聲，穿回巢去，唱着得意的山歌。</p>

<p>— 老鷹</p>
<p>飛機！是小朋友們最喜歡抬着頭看的。飛行！是二十世紀新少年最得意的一回事。可是飛行家在天空裏常常遇着漫天徧地的雲霧，迷失了上下四方，看不出路道，是很危險的。有時在空中遇到疾風暴雨，好似孤舟陷在大海的波濤裏，使你無法駕駛，也是極危險的。</p>
<p>科學家爲要替航空減少危險，替飛行家找一條安全的路道，現在居然快要試騐成功了！</p>
<p>那條航空的新路在那裏呢？</p>
<p>原來空氣的上層，約莫離地十一公里以上，呌做「同温層」的，那裏没有雲霧，（因爲在雲霧之上了。）没有電閃雷雨，没有冷熱變化，（氣温是永遠平穩的，所以呌做同温層，）飛機在這樣的高氣層裏航行，他的速度要比尋常飛行快上好幾倍。</p>
<p>所以將來的航空，不但十分安全，而且非常迅速。據最近法國飛行家德爾摩托造成的最速紀錄是平均一小時飛行四百三十一公里。預料將來同温層裏尋常一小時可飛行一千公里呢！</p>
<p>有志氣的小朋友們！我們的念頭應該轉到天空裏去！</p>

<p>— 班聞</p>
<p>我曾在本刋寫了篇魚類的武器，内容叙述魚類依靠了它們所特有的武器，以防禦去侵害它們生命的别種生物。末了還動問小朋友：「你們的武器是什麽呢？」</p>
<p>現在我告訴你們：你們的武器是「智識。」在你們這樣的年齡，都正在開始獲得淺易的「智識」，因爲人類要人「智識」，才能够生存。</p>
<p>美國的大哲學家杜威曾經說過這樣的一句話：「智識就是權威」，它的意思就是說，人類有了「智識」，才有生存的權威。魚類是下等的生物，它們的武器專靠利齒，脊，尾等，就是没有「智識」的原故。我們人類旣是高等的生物，所以我們的武器應該是比較文明一點而也是最有效能的一種了。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們，快去培植「智識」的苗子，它們將會萌芽，以至於結實。别因爲一時的疏嬾，而不能够嘗到果實的甜汁呀！</p>
<p>你們的武器是「智識」！</p>

<p>— 兪百祿</p>
<p>假使你肯依我的話去做，那麽你所做成的盒子，一定會包有世界的，方法是像下面說的一樣簡單。</p>
<p>工具和材料　裝二百念五枝的烟盒子一個，白紙一張，再加筆和墨。</p>
<p>製法　用筆將全盒的内部用墨塗得漆黑，等乾了，將白紙貼在盒子的中間，分成兩雙等積的長方形爲度，再在盒子的一頭，用針去刺一個微小的孔，另一頭，用剪刀剪成雙毫般大的孔，然後蓋上蓋（蓋的内部也須塗墨的。）這盒子就成功了。</p>
<p>玩法　用手拿盒，把一雙眼睛閉了，一雙開的眼睛（假使你不能這樣做，或這樣做覺得眼晴很不適意，那麽可以一隻手拿盒，一隻手把眼晴掩住。）靠行剪成的孔，這樣外面的世界就會映在你的盒子裏的白紙上，人，車，他們都會動，不過是倒的罷了。</p>
<p>這是什麽理由呢？小朋友也許都要問我罷，不過，在這裏因爲你們的學識，和報紙篇幅的關係，暫時我不能告訴你什麽，告訴了你是反會使你糢糊的。好在不久的將來，物理會告訴你得透澈明瞭，關於這一點，只希望諸小朋友努力讀書了。</p>

<p>— 褚劍屏</p>
<p>我們校園裏的石子堆，至今已有三年之久了；現在我把它的來源寫出來，請諸位小朋友靜心一讀。</p>
<p>有一天，我們校裏有個乙組三年級生，手裏拿了一隻橡皮製的小貓，吱吱的揑着，玩着，非常得意</p>
<p>「這是東洋貨呀！你怎麽這樣不知愛國」？我一見就這樣責備他；</p>
<p>「那有什麽要緊？攏總不過兩毛錢，他們拿去也發不了財，我們也窮不到那呀兒呀一！他很有理的和我辯駁：我聽他的口氣，知道没有事實證明，是和他說不明白的；於是立刻知照全體學生，從明天起，在到校的時候，須各人在路上拾一塊石子，丢在校園裏規定的地方，不可忘記，也不可間斷；他們雖然都覺得莫明其妙，但是不能不照着做。</p>
<p>一星期之後，堆的石子已有三尺多高了；我就指了這石子堆，問以前玩小貓的學生說：一你現在還能說兩毛錢不要緊嗎？你看！我們校裏，祇有一百多人，而積起一星期的小石子，已有那麽高，如果四萬萬的中國人，都送兩毛錢給東洋人，你想那總數該有多少」？這樣一來，全校的學生都明白了。</p>

<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>天氣是漸漸的熱了，人們所最厭惡的蒼蠅，也漸漸的出現了。蒼蠅雖然是很小的東西，但是它能傳染時疫，一年不知有多少人，要爲它送掉性命。所以蒼蠅是我們的仇敵，我們應該來撲滅它。蒼蠅的繁殖，是極速的，大槪現在的一個蒼蠅，將來就會變成數十萬，甚至幾百萬的蒼蠅。假如我們現在拍死一個蒼蠅，就好比將來拍死幾十萬，幾百萬的蒼蠅一樣。所以現在是我們拍蒼蠅的時候，我希望小朋友們，在放課以後，來從事拍蠅工作，這對於衛生·和淸潔上，都是很有關係的。不過拍蒼蠅是不能用物拍，而要用綠紗作的蒼蠅拍子拍。並且拍死的蒼蠅，須要放在火裏燒掉，拍完以後，更要把蒼蠅拍子藏好，千萬不能用手去摸。因爲拍過蒼蠅的拍子，是很髒的。這一點，小朋友們應當特别注意。還有拍過蒼蠅以後，應該把兩隻手洗乾凈了，再拿東西吃。小朋友們！大家來從事拍蒼蠅工作吧！</p>

<p>— 許察傑</p>
<p>蟲呀，蛇呀，蟹呀……還有許許多多的昆蟲，牠們長大一回，必要蛻皮一次。蛻皮的時候，把舊的表皮，齊根脫去，再生新的表皮。諸位小朋友見了，一定要感覺到牠們爲甚麽不怕痛苦，不憚麻煩，一定要這樣的做，其實牠們也是不得呀！</p>
<p>昆蛇的表皮，内含石灰質，只會硬化，不會擴大。昆蟲身體的内部，一天天的長大起來，表皮把牠束縛，實在使牠不舒，所以把舊的表皮蛻去，另生一層寬大的表皮來。昆蟲的蛻皮，實在也是牠們生理上的關係呀！</p>

<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>孕婦到了七八個月以後，而仍呌她照常艱辛地工作，這在有文化，有組織的人類社會，該是一件不應有的事。然而這事正和其他侵佔，剝削，壓迫；各種不應有的事一樣，仍然在現在社會存在着。</p>
<p>已婚婦女她竟然抛撇了家庭的任務，子女的養育，而來各機關各工廠尋长微細的收入，那她的背後無疑的是有一隻飢餓的生活之狼追着。這使她不得不爲了每月三五元或十餘元的工資，而甘冒苦痛和危險，至於肚皮大了的時候，還得喘息地在工作之門拐出拐進。非是她禀性貪婪，乃因那隻餓狼，不會因她將近解懷，而放鬆她一步。</p>
<p>職業孕婦因過度的操作，而發生流產，難產，或死亡的事件，此刻雖找不到詳確的統計，然而牠的數量，無欵地是大可驚人。這，眞是從那兒說起？</p>
<p>有些開明一點的機關，對於職業高尙一點的女敎員，女職員之類，還給她產前產後各一月的假期，薪水照常發業低一等的工女和傭婦，則不但受不到這種優待，而且在她生產以後，没有工資的幾日休息中，還有職業被他人奪去的憂慮。</p>
<p>傭婦的工作，還是或輕或重，間竭不等：最難堪是工女的工作，在固定的時間以内，不容你有一分一秒的休息。孕婦處此，甚於地獄。平日她們對於廠家，有何辜負？在機器工業女工之下，女工的工作率不弱於男工，然而工資的相差，常至一倍。目今女工大抵未婚者居多，一工廠的女工，每年能有幾人懷孕以她們平日工資方面的利潤，周濟幾個孕婦使她產前產後得到休息。也是情理之常。</p>
<p>國人開口說甚麽禮義綱常，其實禮敎中人便是最不講道義的一類。自來習俗有所謂四大諱：一諱西益宅，二諱婦人乳了，四諱舉正月五月子。至今封建社會，讀書人還是不踏進產婦的臥室，雖是自已的妻子將至危殆之際。婦人生產小孩，本是有功人類的神聖工作，而士大夫竟目爲不祥而加以忌諱。其對於婦女的血肉，多麽的輕視；對於自已本身的來源，又多麽的菲薄！</p>
<p>由於傳統的對婦女生產的輕視，加以殘酷的剝削，於是而孕婦到了臨益之期，而仍拚命地拚命地照常工作的問題，便成了無問題。</p>
<p>一切有問題的事都給變成無問題，這本是輕而易舉之事，只消大家把眼睛閉下，便可看不見黑白。只是這一來所有的人都成了盲目，豈但職業孕婦一方面的不幸，其如中華民族的文化何？其如中華民族的生存何？</p>
<p>職業孕婦產前產後的給資休息的問題，是許多問題中的小小的一片，並不是牽碍到各方面的大事件。只要大家對牠不全然漠視，只要最低限度還有人道主義存在人心，希望社會上能熱烈地推動激盪。使牠早日地普遍地施行！</p>

<p>— 茲九</p>
<p>五月四日大公報，載有淸華大學敎授陳達先生在北平扶輪會演講「生育節制在中國之需要」一文，因陳先生的聲望與命題的剌目，引起了我特别的注意，但卒讀講詞，有不能已於言者：誰都知道整個中國，已陷入貧窮愚旺，疾病死亡的慘境裏；天災人禍的交擊中，但所以致此的原因，不在人口的過剩，而在政制之欠良與環境的惡劣。陳先生不抓住問題的中心，捨本就未地說：「欲防災於未然，急需節制生育，藉此減少痛苦，改善民族」—陳先生是震於賑務會的報告：「中國十四省災民達六千萬萬之詞，而發此宏論的。—茲根據大公報的記載，—茲根據大公報的記載，逐點與陳先生檢討如下；</p>
<p>減少死亡</p>
<p>我們認爲造成中國當前可怕的死亡率的，不是人口的過剩或生育的過多，而陳先生說：「如能達至愛爾蘭生殖率之程度，則每年出生者可减至七百萬人，而每年死亡者可由一千二百萬減至五百萬」。卽置愛爾蘭的衛生行政與民智是否與中國相符於不論，事實上内憂外患尙未消滅之前，天災不會由人力來減少，人民的死亡只會增加，不會減少的，假若一般人多聽從了陳先生的學說，一方生育廣大地減少，他方人口仍急速地在死亡，中國民族不將完全消滅？古來只有因人口減少而滅亡的國家，絶没有因人口增加而亡國的例子。</p>
<p>兒童敎育</p>
<p>陳先生說：「一九二五年時，英國入學兒童，約當其學齡兒童百分之九十三，而中國情形據敎育部之報告，其比例僅爲百分之九，吾人要改良人口之質量，當然需要减少生育。」减少生育，眞能改良人種的質量嗎？我們知道：敎育的發達與否，是政府的責行，政府每年從人民身上抽收大筆敎育捐稅，爲的興辦學校，在這文盲徧野的現實中，消極的只有督促政府急速改良現行學制，以謀人人有受敎育的機會，而陳敎授之意，似乎想把現有的及未來的兒童數硬生生地削减到百分之九，讓這少數的人來享受敎育的機會。這不是「削足就履」嗎？試看印度安南，不是人口日在减少，而他們的文化，並没有與日俱進地增高，我並不願以亡國民族來比喩，不過借此證明敎育，全賴政治力來推進。</p>
<p>提高生活</p>
<p>陳先生大意是「中國工人收入過少，不能負擔兒童敎育費用，減少生育，生活得以提高。姑置方法是否於不論，卽就事實來說：現在一般工人，有的是性的衝動，談不到性的知識，而「性」可以說勞働者，「僅有的樂的享受」所以不但不會人工的節與制，簡直是不可能。陳先生這段理論，我們只能當他是空口講白話。要提高工人生活，尙特别的途徑</p>
<p>改善環境</p>
<p>「吾民族生息於此艱難困苦之社會環境，維持其生命已至不易……僅堅持增大生育尙有何用？吾人何故不借生育之節制，而改良中國社會環境乎？」這是講詞第四叚的大意。中國一般人民，處於艱難困苦的環境中，這是事實，但要節制生育來改事實，但要節制生育來改善環境，亦屬片面之詞。社會環境的惡劣與否，全視當時的經濟條件來决定的。大多數人民，終年爲獲得生活資料而勞碌，或無業而待斃；卽使能節制生育，那有時間能力，從事於「文化」「學術」「事業」的進最？况前面已經說過疲於勞働的人民，節育是很難的呢！</p>
<p>民族健康</p>
<p>「兒童之健康，繫於母親之健康，據醫學論斷，女子經過一度生產之後，其恢復健康，至少需三年，故至少需每隔三年以上，再事生育」對這一點，我没有高深的醫學知識，不敢妄自論斷，不過事實和常識告訴我，似乎不需要這多長的時日。卽使照陳先生的論斷而實行節育，但國家對於衛生的設備是如此，而人事又如彼，中國兒童縱能由先天帶來了健康的體質，怕也不會個個康健地長成！</p>
<p>陳先生的講詞，完全是站在他自已的生活環境而發的，是命運論的說敎者，也可以說是馬爾薩斯的信徒，但馬爾薩斯的「人口原理」，已被有識者評爲「淺薄與僧侣的口吻」，而陳敎授似乎很倍服馬爾薩斯的。—這裏我不敢非薄陳先生，過去卽達　文及其他學者，也不少受馬爾薩斯之愚的—總之我們深信，中國不打倒帝國主義與革除封建勢力，卽使人口减至愛爾蘭的生殖率，甚至再少，結果，更速中國的滅亡而已。至於生育節制之行於有性病，某種傳染病的或孱弱的人們，當然是應該的，這人們，當然是應該的，這種人，不但應使他節慾，且應割除他的慾綫。此外因個人的事業，學術，而節育的，是文明社會必有的現象。但這不能認爲「國策」在人類尙未發明别種方法來傳以前，節育只有認爲個人主義的勉强的行爲，何用大聲疾呼來的行爲，何用大聲疾呼來提倡質諸陳先生以爲何如？</p>
<p>魚語諒</p>
<p>撫了遍體的鱗傷，兀自的思量：爲了一個水花泡影，疑是水晶宫門，不住的追逐，不住的找尋，不自覺地進了人們設下的羅網。待覺察了，爲要爭回原有的自由，幾度的掙扎，才弄得現在這樣的遍體鱗傷，但儘是這樣，我已堅定了我的心腸，祗要能刺破這羅綱，得自由地泳躍，豈祇鱗傷，就是粉身碎骨，我出樂於試嘗。網中的伙伴們呵！勿再悲恨，也莫感傷，祗要團結你們的力量前進呵！向這同一的方向！</p>

<p>— 華</p>
<p>七歐文（續）</p>
<p>關於歐文理想中的男女平等的社會，我們上次業已簡略地說過了，現在來叙述他對現代婚姻和家庭的銳利的批評。　　歐氏認爲强制結合的婚烟，乃家庭不幸的原因，在此種不幸中，女子所受痛苦，特别厲害，兒女在道德上因而淪落。他認爲賣淫是貎合神離的「敎會」婚姻的一個結果。歐文曾說：</p>
<p>「人類迄今日三大罪惡—私有財產，盲目的宗敎制度，及基於前兩者的婚姻—的奴隸。人們對於財富日甚一日的追求及因此而形成的婚姻逐漸使我們相距本性愈遠，並使我們在體力上和精神上達到頽廢的地步了。……現代的婚烟，只是牧師的一種陰險的虚構，爲的使人民依存於國家和敎會的非自然的法律。牧師所作成的這種結合，只是給了富者與富者以結合的機會。在現代的一切社會中，甚至商人亦非例外，並没有像夫與妻間這種相互關係上的虚僞與欺瞞。</p>
<p>們都在說，婦女的貞操，惟有婚姻中所確定的法定奴隸制，方能保證。但是可以有很大的權利說，婦女的貞操，要有保證，惟有在現今的婚姻方式消滅以後。那時，賣淫還能像今日這麽流行麽？」</p>
<p>歐洲在一百餘年以前，婚姻全是由牧師操縱支配，結婚儀式非在敎堂舉行不可，其毒害不下於我國舊時「父母之命，媒妁之言。」所以，歐氏才有這樣深刻而銳利的批評。其次歐文對於現代</p>
<p>家庭批評道：</p>
<p>「家庭在兒童心中發展一種利已主義情感，敎兒童把自已的家庭看作一個小小世界，在其中重複，　　我的房子，我的妻子，我的財產，　　我的子女，我的丈夫……」</p>
<p>因此歐氏除主張根本改變現代社會組織外，並斷言有改良家庭關係的必要。他推想，惟有十足的公共生活，可以打破現在家庭制度所過的利已主義的閉塞生活。他說：</p>
<p>「新世界的居民，須居住在一起，在公共飯堂就食；取消個别的房屋，而代以廣大的公共寄宿舍；不論個人或家庭，都不能有私產；每個人爲社團的一份子；人人同享公共財富—公共勞動的果實，不分軒輊。那時婦女所享權利，完全與男子一樣，所以，其地位不消說將是完全獨立的。兒童寗是屬於公社所有，而非雙親。因無益的職業和浪費的奢侈完全消滅的結果，生產力巨大增長，使社會財富激增，那時凡限制生育的一切考慮，都是用不着了。自然，那時社會要注意兩性適當的結合，爲的防止惡疾之傳染於兒童或劣等種族的增殖。」</p>
<p>歐氏竭力主張兒童公育，其所擬的辦法是：「兒童自三歲起，須入學校，在公共飯堂就食，在公共宿舍寄宿；但父母呆以隨時去看視談話。在學校裏，兒童須獲得一切必要而有益的知識；那時務須時務須竭力防止兒童從其父母或用别種方法獲得種種惡習慣；同時，須給兒童暗示以良好習慣和嗜好，使其趨向於幸生活的幸福，並成爲社會的有益的一員。」　　最後，歐氏關於將來婦女職業說道：「將來婦女的職業，第一是看護兒童和自已的住所；第二是栽培花園，種植公共飯堂所需的菜蔬；第三是擔任適於女性的紡織工作：第四是製作機關人員的衣服；第五是在公共飯堂，公共宿舍輪流任職。那時婦女本身所受敎育良好，亦可監督學校中兒童敎育的若干部分。」</p>
<p>不過歐　　其他烏托邦社會主義者（如傳立葉）一樣，高飛於純理論的雲際，一味描述自已的理想，未搭下至人間地獄的橋樑，未考慮到社會的現實狀態及其動力，換言之，怎樣由人間地獄可渡至天堂樂園，他却未指示出方法來。所以，歐氏的要求和說敎，都不適於作爲發動大衆去爲婦女解放事業而奮鬭的口號。</p>
<h3 id="c282">紀念廬隱 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 斐</p>
<p>「五四」怒潮，曾經湧起很多美麗璀璨的浪花，廬隱，不用說也是那種浪花之一，可是，她並没有隨着潮流，一瀉千里，就那麽樣停滯在一灣水裏！</p>
<p>眞的，好久以前，我已經有這麽一個感想；「我們的作家——廬隱，有些兒老了！」</p>
<p>可是，在「婦女回到家庭裏去」，「賢妻良母主義」逆流横泛的今日，廬隱忽然死去！唉！在「不容女子做人」的空氣裏，無端又損失這麽一個「努力做人」的女子！太令人感憤了！越想，我越對廬隱起了敬慕和哀悼！於是在廠隱入殮的時候，跑去參加她的殯儀。</p>
<p>殯儀，是基督敎式的，大家默默地獻上眼涙以後，在讚神詩歌，讀經祈禱，牧師宣敎的氛圍裏，她——廬隱的親友，說那種儀式是廬隱的遺囑；她是怎樣具有宗敎的感情，合乎宗敎家的言行；以及對人接物的賢良；簡直是個具有宗敎信仰的賢妻良母典型，——雖然當時也有廬隱的一個讀者不滿這種對廬隱的曲解，起來指出廬隱的「反宗法」，「反封建」，「努力做人」的精神，以及遺囑是一種「生的執着」，並非什麽宗敎的信仰！可是我仍然不禁爲我們的作家再事呼寃！</p>
<p>大凡略知廬隱生平的，都知道她吤則在兒時受過宗敎敎育，受過洗禮，可是一到中學時代，便叛了敎了！「五四」時代，她爲北京學生會很著名領袖之一！她的言行，她的作品，無不充分表現出她那種反對舊社會反對舊思想——舊禮敎的精神！就拿她的戀愛故事來說吧，亦很膽大而澈底的——當郭夢良死後，她爲殉愛，跑到郭家過了年餘，終又逃出了大家庭的覊絆，鍾情了「小愛人」！所以雖然她没有跟着時代更向前進，但至少是有脫下奴隸的外套，懷着做人的意志的！</p>
<p>再就她的遺著裏，我們試一檢尋她的思想：遠的且不必翻牠，就拿現在大家看見的兩篇來說吧：在「夢」的一篇裏，她結尾寫著：「露挹拏着鋼斧，向那荆棘叢中砍伐，尖刺傷了她的手指和脚趾，鮮血一滴滴的染紅她的衣裙；但是牠已隱隱看見遙遠的前道在閃光，於是她不再顧忌命運之神的驕悍，她只把了一個找出路的信念向前去。」</p>
<p>牠在少女的眼涙裏，也有這麽一段：「是的，你們很富於同情心，這是人類極偉大的情緒，不過你們眞是太孩子氣了，這是一件事實，你們想用你們的眼涙解决牠嗎？孩子們，也許你們是對的，你們想用同情的熱涙洗凈人間的罪惡，······不過這個世界眞理早被一切的惡勢力所征服了，因此，只替她哭是無用的。」　　由此，可見她雖没怎樣前進，但也絶不曾後退呀！她生前只顧挺起脊樑抬起頭來做人的。</p>
<h3 id="c283">失竊 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 以明</p>
<p>一天上午宿舍裏發現失了竊。</p>
<p>失主是住着二樓的幾位小姐，她們中有的已是喪失了父母；有的連弟兄也没有便自已掌握着家權，所以這次的遺失除了百餘元外還加着些重要的物件。</p>
<p>偸竊，在這兒已有短期的歷史，據說去年也有過相彷的事，而且偷者竟是位頗有身分的小姐，但不幸被覺出了，學校當局不得不悄悄地通知了她的家長，於是她，被帶走了，默默地，没有半點聲息。</p>
<p>可是這次很有點不同，也許是事情嚴重的緣故吧？風聲飛快地傳出，也飛快地鑽進了所有人的耳窩，於是各個抱着新鮮的，好奇的心情，來期待新鮮的結果。　　一堆一堆的蠅也似的嗡着：肥胖的舍監抖動着渾身的囹肉在忙走。她每對着迎面而來的女生投個笑臉，接着是同樣那麽一句話：</p>
<p>「今天我要來查你們的房間噢！」她的聲音彷彿含有無限的歉意，同時像在暗示竊者快去把東西匿藏，免得被她搜出。　　隨着宿舍内有了搜查及暫時禁止學生出外的佈告，但搜查，直到黑暗統領大地後還不見實行。自然，娘姨的房内早搜遍了的，每件衣縫，每隻被角也不輕易放過，但依然找不得半點證據。這時誰也不知侒竟誰偷誰不偷，只有被嫌疑着的娘姨和「她」知道。</p>
<p>這賊，顯然不是男的。雖則女生隨時可以很自由的出外；可以整夜被男朋友摟着旋轉於“Ｇｏｏｄｎｉｇｈｔ，Ｖｉｅｎｎａ”的樂奏裏，但内禁却很嚴緊，平日連一隻雄狗也不許它經過的。</p>
<p>終於偵探來了，大家好像感覺了更大的興趣，好奇心在各人的胸中，彷彿誰在靜水内擲了顆石子，渾圓的波紋層次在向湖面擴大。當時我和其餘的人一樣孕着那種心情　進房去，只見偵探細察了被刀挖傷的箱子，隨後對旁邊的娘姨說「把你的鑰匙拿來！」從自已的房内娘姨把鑰匙拿來了。偵探於是在一串中揀出一個插入鎖去一轉，鎖豁地開了。</p>
<p>「還有什麽話說？錢，證明是你偷的！」偵探現出得意的獰笑對驚住了的娘姨說。</p>
<p>「先生，我没有偷……」偵探不待她說完把鑰匙向她臉邊一幌接着說：</p>
<p>「没有偷？這是什麽？」</p>
<p>「先生，我確實没有偷，鑰匙是碰巧相同。如果是我偷的話，爲什麽不早把它丢了呢？旣有鑰匙好開爲什麽要用力來挖呢？」</p>
<p>「那是你弄的圈套，誰知道呢？總之，這裏惟有你柨窮；人一窮就是幹壤事了……難道這裏的小姐會偷嗎？她們是吃得好穿得好，自已的錢很多，還去要别人嗎？只有窮人才見財不要命的！」　　「别這麽說，先生！我雖貧苦，心地却很淸白的」。窮人不一定都會做壞事；有許多壞事窮人倒反做不出呢！</p>
<p>「偷了錢還要强嘴？」不知偵探爲什麽羞怒起來，「錢，定是你偷的！……好，限你三天之内把東西交出，否則，老實不客氣便得跟我到行裏去！」</p>
<p>「我眞正没有倫，」娘姨依然堅持地說「硬要我去坐牢，去吃苦也是没法的，横竪只有條老命好拼……可憐我孤苦的人……」聽了三天以後的坐牢，一種久被過度的勞苦所掩蓋着的悲哀的身世之感，此刻一齊躍上了她的心頭：不禁老涙你斷綫的珠子般滾下來。</p>
<p>這情景撕裂着我的以，我掩了臉從人堆内逃了出來；娘姨的眼涙有如煎油點點落在我心上。是的，她說得不錯，世上有許多壞事正是窮人所做不出的；而且有許多惡毒的心腸也正是窮人所少有的！娘姨自身便是個例子。她知道自已没有偷，平日只是牛馬般忠心地服侍着小姐們，而結果反做了别人的替死鬼，也許她所替死的正是一個被她服侍着的闊氣的小姐呢！</p>
<p>想像着三天以後所她；想像着她無以供認時被鞭的情形，我彷彿淸楚地聽得了她的悽慘的呼聲。我忍不住用手掩了雙耳，但這聲音彷彿更在向我擴大，成了許多悲慘的號呌……」</p>

<h3 id="c285">所謂廣田對華新政策 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 寒影</p>
<p>挾廣田新訓令，有吉駐華公使又將離東京返任了。聞有吉此來將努力誘我直接解决各懸案，以共存共榮的口號，促我與日僞進行經濟合作。行見中日問題，又將轉入一新階段。據報載，外相廣田所示最近對華政策，内容包含六點。我們現在且把牠列後，逐條加以反駁：</p>
<p>（一）因四一七聲明後，華方對日感情又變，誤會日本存心侵略中國，公使歸任後，應解釋日方之眞意在維持遠東之和平，謀中日兩國之共存共榮，促華方對此政策有所了解。</p>
<p>日本四一七的聲明，已將整個對華陰謀暴露無餘，其獨覇東亞的野心，早爲世人所洞悉。今廣田反謂該聲明的眞意，在維持遠東的和平，謀中日兩國的共存共榮，促我國對此政策加以了解，豈非自欺欺人之言！試問遠東和平要怎樣維持？共存共榮作如何解釋？若强迫他國於自已控制之下，謂之爲維持遠東和平，攫奪他國的土地以爲已有，謂之爲共存共榮，那我們眞不敢領敎了！</p>
<p>（二）日本要中國了解日「滿」兩國共同分負東亞和平之責，如中國酲悟，接受日本之懇意，日乃爲友邦中國之繁榮與統一，不惜其援助。</p>
<p>日本的懇意何在，我國至今不能了解，也未敢接受！我國只覺得東亞之不能和平，其責任應由日本担負。因爲東亞本甚和平，九一八日佔東四省而後，才呈動亂之象，至若我國之繁榮與統一，已給日本破壞無遺了，援助實不敢當！我們唯望今後不再給人破壞已算幸事了！</p>
<p>（三）凡有包含離間中日兩國共存關係之第三者之一切行動，日本决反糕對到底，應使中國了解日本之政策，促成中日兩國之政治經濟上之歙和，如法國對正太路之借欵，日認爲公正之對華援助，惟國際之技術合作，日認爲將促開共管之端，故反對之。</p>
<p>這條是說明日本不許第三者干涉日本的對華侵略，及反對任何國際的對華援助。我國是一獨立自主國，也是一國聯會員國，有請國聯援助的權利。技術合作，是否將促成共管之端，尙不可知。若果眞有此危險，則我們之對於共管，亦如對於獨覇一樣，要極力加以反抗的，毌勞日本代爲担憂。我國對於各國作經濟上的合作，如帶有侵略性，不但日本，卽任何國亦必拒絶之。</p>
<p>（四）恢復中日兩國之貿易，完成以日本爲盟主之東亞經濟圈，使中國了解，增加兩國之貿易乃增進兩國民衆之福利。</p>
<p>什麽呌做東亞經濟圈？誰認日本爲盟主？這有些不可解。增進兩國的貿易，於日當然有利，於我就有損了，我國民衆尙有何福利可言？</p>
<p>（五）使中國當局了解，恢復中國農村之破產惟有與日「滿」兩國合作，力倡中日「滿」三國之經濟合作，可以促成東亞之繁榮，且可藉此救其自國之財界，促中國政治家及其指導階級了解其責任，以期實現中日「滿」經濟聯盟之計劃。</p>
<p>中國農村的破產，乃帝國主義者經濟侵略過分的結果。要救濟此危機，惟有盡力抵抗此侵略。與日「滿」合作，不但不能恢復其繁榮，適足以促其加速崩潰。所謂中日「滿」經濟聯盟的計劃，這是什麽人的計劃？</p>
<p>（六）中國以財政上之理由提高關稅，阻止日貨之　銷，此政策有阻害日本產業界之繁榮，日須從民衆立塲，力倡用價賤之日貨有利於消費者，勸說中國當局修改關稅，經减中國消費者之負擔，以便推銷日貨。</p>
<p>提高關稅，阻止日貨的傾銷，此政策有阻害日本產業界的繁榮，這是事實。因爲這麽一來，日本的經濟侵略，便不能進行順利了。要打開此阻害，自然就非要求我國修改關稅不成。然而世界各國，未聞有願修改關稅，以便外貨傾銷者。若謂此可以减輕人民的擔負，那末日本儘可將關稅取消，任外貨侵入，日國民豈不受賜多了嗎？日本以爲何如？此種要求，誰能受其愚？</p>
<p>綜觀日本所提六點，實屬無理之至！一二百餘件懸案，欲在此基本原則之下解决，此時實嫌過早！除非全國人心死盡，我以爲誰也不肯接受的！</p>

<p>— 家煥</p>
<p>夏天日裏是很長；紗廠還没吹過回聲，天就亮了。</p>
<p>黑漆的糞車，每天這時就進了弄堂，鐵質的輪輾着三合土上發出隆隆的巨響，接着：「倒馬桶呀！」一個尖刀似的吼聲，替借了紗廠的汽笛，睡夢中的人們，被戳着一刀似的，福經突然受到一刺痛，驚醒過來，弄堂隨着便起了一陣騷動。　　樓底下房東太太，許是上了年紀神經衰弱之故，所以容易驚醒；當那「倒馬桶呀！」頭一聲從弄口傳來，接着就是她喊的聲音了。</p>
<p>「玉英哪！倒馬桶的來了，快些！後樓嫂嫂！亭子間···「喊過她媳婦，然後就是後樓嫂嫂，亭子間，依次的喊到了；這好像成了她每天淸早一種固定的　務，她便是這屋裏一架時鐘，住在這裏的房客照着她的凖則起身是不會誤點的。　　這屋裏起身最早的是後樓嫂嫂；每天房東太太喊時，總是她先答應着。　　「謝謝你，好婆！我起來了。」天天早上都是這句；聲調都是那麽地柔和，使人聽了就感到種愉快。</p>
<p>今天早上不曉得怎麽地，許是睡着了；樓下喊過一次，二次，後樓嫂嫂還是没有答應。房東的媳婦早就起了身，亭子間裏女人也走了，這些我都聽得明白。怎麽她還不起來，不要眞的睡着了吧？我有點兒替她擔心似的，睡在床上老是不大安靜。　　「後樓嫂嫂！下面好婆喊過了，你還不起來？時候不早了，再不起來，就來不及上廠囉！」我怕她眞的睡忘了不記得上廠，伸手便在板壁上敲了幾下。</p>
<p>「啊！……謝謝你，阿叔！我，我不做了……」後樓嫂嫂說話的聲音有些顫抖，像是要哭的樣了。</p>
<p>「怎麽？不做了？」我心跳了跳；「廠裏没有生活吧？」加緊的問着。</p>
<p>没有回答；可是，她眞個哭了，而且哭得非常的傷心。　　我聽到她哭的那麽凄楚，曉得她的工作是眞的歇了。但她平日做工却非常的勤懇，從不曾見她停過一天；這屋裏每天起身最早的算她是第一個，向來没有誤過鐘點，怎麽會把她歇掉的原因，却使人够費思索的了。</p>
<p>太陽悄悄地透了進來，晒着房中的樓板，熱度是漸漸地昇高起來，床上像有無數的螞蟻在週身咬着，皮膚感着針戳似的苦痛。這時，我又想起了後樓嫂嫂的哭聲。心裏總繫着個老大的疙　，任憑怎樣都睡不安定。</p>
<p>跳下牀來，無聊地在房裏踱着；心裏兀自感着像丢掉一件貴重的東西，一時找不着般的苦惱。</p>
<p>「「砰」，「砰」！前樓阿叔！」這不是後樓嫂嫂在敲着門</p>
<p>麽？我突然地一怔，走去開開了門。</p>
<p>「阿叔！想託你一件事，肯不？」她勉强地笑了笑；眼皮上還是紅的。</p>
<p>「是寫信麽？可以，可以。」我看她乎裏拏了幾張信紙信封，很快的答應了。　　「謝謝你！眞的，常常要麻煩你，難爲情······」臉上稍稍浮起一層紅暈，她怕我看見她那害羞的樣子，趕忙拿塊手巾在眼睛上擦着。　　「這没有什麽，同居一間屋裏還客氣什麽。是寫到漢口去的麽？我曉得，和她通信的就祇有她的丈夫；不過我這麽問她，也好像成了習慣，每回替她寫信總是這樣的。</p>
<p>「是的！」</p>
<p>的　的「信上面說些什麽呢？不久以前不」是是寫過一封信嗎？隔幾天就要通一次信，人家没結婚的夫妻，也没有你們這麽的殷勤啊！」打趣的和她說着，她也禁不住笑起來。她說：「前樓阿叔眞開將心起來；别人在這裏飯都快没有得吃，還談什麽要好？」她緊縐着眉頭，微微地倒抽口冷氣。</p>
<p>「没有飯吃？客氣。」我表示不信任的樣子。</p>
<p>「眞的，這有什麽客氣？請你就這樣替我寫：說我廠裏生活不做了，現在想回去，呌他趕快寄點錢給我做川資。我不想再在上海生活，上海也没有我們生活的餘地，有力氣也賣不出錢：我情願回到鄉下去，那怕使盡了氣力，比在上海拿力氣賣錢還要看人家的嘴臉要舒暢得多······」喉嚨又像早上似的有點硬了；臉是慘白得怕人，額角上淌着豆大的汗珠，像給暴風雨淋過了一樣。　　我照着她說的意思寫着，等她說完了我也就把筆放下。　　「還有吧？」我說，「你在廠裏怎樣出來的情形不告訴他麽？」</p>
<p>「是的，我想告訴他：不過寫長了，你不着累嗎？」她望着我笑了笑，似乎很抱歉的。　　「不要緊，寫封把信算什麽。」我自負的說。</p>
<p>「那末，謝謝你！」她又笑了笑，接着說：「我日昨天出來的；這個月總共做了十二天生活，拿了三元八角錢的工資！！」</p>
<p>「怎麽，十二天祇有三元八角錢？」我截住她的話問。　　「是啊！這已經算不錯了！」她感嘆似的說。至少呌他要寄十塊錢來，不然我便不得動身。這是没有法子的事，並不是我不肯賣力氣做工；原因是工頭有了自已人没地方安插，才把我們拿來開刀······」</p>
<p>「他總也要拿點理由出來吧？你不犯事他無故地就能開除你嗎？」我對她的話起了點懷疑。</p>
<p>「要理由麽？那是很便當。他的嘴大，我們的嘴小，他的理由總是對的；「鷄蛋裏面尋骨頭」，他都尋得出來，找工人的錯處還有什麽不容易呢？」她張大了眼晴，顯着很有經騐的樣子對我看着。</p>
<p>「是的，這是他們的專長；但是究竟找着你什麽錯誤，把你開除了呢？」我緊接着問。</p>
<p>「你聽吧！你聽了就照我那麽說的寫上罷。」她又送過一張信紙來，「我們那種磨杯子生活，簡直可以說和做泥水匠没有兩樣；一天到晚全個身子就是浸在爛泥裏討生活。那麽像火車劊子似的一個沙盤，跟着「馬達」同樣的轉着；上空吊着水箱，爛泥便侵在箱裏隨水洪流到沙盤上。水　沙盤旋起的風力，暴風雨似的飄灑到各人身上，全身一層層凝着的全是爛泥，就像落雨天在鄉下灰泥路上跌了一交似的，爬起來簡直看不見嘴臉。玻璃杯的性質非常脆弱，如果碰到軋口不齊的就容易破碎……」她拿取一隻玻璃杯來指點給我看</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>，怕我不大明白她說的意思。接着說：一這時稍不留心，自已的手就會受到像玻璃杯同等的命運。在這時手割開了是不打緊的，决没有誰來過問；不過，同時如果聽到玻璃杯子破裂的響聲，工頭便馬上會趕過來睜着眼睛亂駡一頓。我手上不也有許多割開的痕跡嗎？可是因了這許多痕跡，却看過無數次的嘴臉，聽過無數次的咀咒！</p>
<p>昨天，軋口機突然的壞了；工頭看着成千打杯子，感着没有辦法的憤怒，像落水鷄似的跳着。「像落水鷄似的跳着。「死人！機器快要壞了都不曉得，你像做事的人嗎？飯桶！」軋口機上的工人聽他駡着，站在那裏像石像似的眼望着損壞的機器；臉上像下過雨似的流着汗水，彷彿是地圖上畫的河流。「站在這裏幹麽？還等請吧，唔？」工頭握着軋口工人的臂膊朝前一推。他這才做了塲惡夢似的淸醒了過來，身子往前一栽，險些兒像餓狗舐屎樣的跌到；别的工人看得都製開嘴笑了。他總算把機器上的毛病醫治好了；工頭臉上鐵靑的顏色也稍稍退了一些。</p>
<p>「軋口的工人究竟不是銅匠，雖勉强把機器修好了，終究不及從前軋出來的杯子那麽齊整。幾千打杯子全都像狗牙齒似的，擺上磨車—沙盤—就噼拍噼拍的破裂起來。工頭的兩顆眼珠子像吃人的怪獸似的睜着，擺着擇人而噬的姿勢，眼光盡在各人臉上轉着；這時判着各人最後的命運。拍！我手上一隻杯子碎了；心撲的一跳，臉上火辣地瞅着沙盤，心恨牠偏在這時同我作對。這時，工頭的眼睛像火燒過似的爆着紅筋，走過來望着我冷笑了一下；惡狠狠地說：「你磨不好不要磨了；都像你這麽會蹧塌杯子，那這廠還開他幹嗎？你大槪也不想幹這骯髒玩意兒，我曉得。你還是回去坐着享福的好，我們這裏也用你不着；你到賬房間裏算工錢去罷。」他連忙寫好拿工錢紙頭給我，沉着臉走了。我不曾和他分辯半句，可也没有什麽可分辯的；他的嘴大，理由說出總是對的。我拿了工錢便走出來，心裏倒反覺得這樣輕快了不少……」她臉上像臘似的更加慘白，胸膛一跳跳地顯着呼吸的困難，彷彿心裏還藏着許多吐不出的痛苦在那裏梗着；表面上却裝着滿不在乎的福情，嘴唇微微閃了閃，吐出一聲苦笑。　　「正要這樣，這廠裏不好再到别家廠去，有氣力還悉賣不了錢嗎？」我曉得這些話是抓不了她的痛癢，可是再找不出比這更適當體貼的話來對她安慰；她這時需要的不是言語，你就是說的能够像黄鶑那般地宛轉動人，也塡不了她肚子裏實際的空虚。</p>
<p>「晤！」她苦笑着。經騐告訴她這是我勉强的安慰；「上海没有我的生活；那一家廠都不是和這一樣呢？「朝裏無人莫做官」，像我這樣孤苦的人，走到任何地方都會遭到同樣的命運！！謝謝你，阿叔！累你寫了這半天，眞……」她感傷似的勉强地站起和我敷衍了幾聲走了。</p>
<p>我看着她的後影，黯然地感着一陣同情的悲哀。「呵！可憐的婦人啊！」輕輕的從我嘴裏飄了出来。</p>

<h3 id="c287">雖一小販而能自食其力不受人憐　蓋傲骨天生毫無抑鬱不平之觀念　奇人丁大爺之轉變 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 杏林</p>
<p>記得某大文豪曾說：「有誰從小康人家墮入窮途的麽？我以爲在這路途中，可以看見世人的眞面目。」窮富兩途，將人隔絶，經過一度轉變，則個人的體氣，世態的炎凉，都得測騐出來，這是一點都不錯的。</p>
<p>天津有一位賣糖堆（就是以冰糖蘸山楂果，以竹篾串連之食物，南方名「糖球」　北方亦名「糖戎蘆」。）的丁大爺，富時揮金如土，貧時自食其力，不受人憐，滑稽玩世，但其傲骨天生，多麽値得世人景仰和心醉啊！</p>
<p>林墨靑曾爲其作小傳云：「丁字伯鈺，人比以大爺尊之，天津世家子也。」</p>
<p>其家故有鈔關差使，津俗所謂大關房也。邑中巨族，半爲戚屬。伯鈺生而席履豐厚，服食玩好，予取予求，出則肩輿騶從，儼然貴官。」讀這一段記載，就可以看出他的生平大略了。丁年十六，卽承父業，「上關」應差，但不脫紈袴之習，揮霍特甚。相傳他吸過鴉片烟，將要出門門房傳呼轎夫伺候，而轎夫也在一榻横陳，猶未過足烟癮，他並不着急，但笑駡着，站在門前等候。可見大爺胸襟廣闊，氣度寬宏，將人比已，能知道轎夫之苦處。他的四個轎夫，在冬天裏，都翻穿灰鼠馬褂，卽此一端，也可想見他當年的豪華了。</p>
<p>他本是個有童心富於興趣的人，常常尋找些新奇的事物以自娛。西人所發明白脚踏車，初發現於津門，乘者皆西人，他立時購置一具，操縱純熟，而華人在天津衛，第一個能乘脚踏車的，卽爲丁。又持錢數百串，購糖數十斤，在客廳中，置風爐銅鍋石版等物，學製糖堆，本以消遣，不料後竟執此業以自贍。　　他的小傳中又云：「庚子變起，家室焚掠一空，鈔關被裁，遂由素豐變爲赤貧，然不肯稱貸，卽親友有憐而周之者，亦必辭却。惟製各種糖食，提筐沿街售賣，一家八口，衣食於是者二十餘年。」</p>
<p>他所製的糖葫蘆，表質皆膾灸人口，外埠也聞名。一來因他由紈袴而淪爲小販，不貪重利，二來也因所製很是講究，確乎好吃。據說他對於熬糖蘸果等工作，皆有特色，製出來冰瑩酥脆，撒灰塵可以不染，置懷中可以不粘。銷路奇廣，每日賺三兩元不等，餬口有餘，悠然自得。居常毫不以盛衰窮通，曾經浛海，而稍生感慨及有抑鬱不平之觀念，丁之所以稱奇，實由於此。</p>
<p>我托跡天津之時，聞其名，破兩日工夫，欲求一面，終不可得。</p>
<p>丁大爺死於民國十八年，享年五十有七歲。無子嗣，老妻先殁。某一次提籃入市，曼聲呌賣，在西芥園地方偶與其戚相遇，憐他落魄，欲贈金勸令改業，丁怒而拒却說：「這個買賣不可做，什麽行業才可做？你以賣糖堆爲下賤，我看開當舖設銀樓也未必高貴。」說罷，拂袖昻然自去，這個親戚郤大大討了没趣。在旁人看來，都以爲他負氣，在我看來，實在是名言至理。</p>
<p>又有一次，他在北大關地方，遇見一個朋友。那人怕他難以爲情，故意回首相避，不料他却趕上去，攔住此人笑道：「你還欠我的錢呢。不要躱我，我没有向你討！」</p>

<p>— 李靑</p>
<p>在北京路轉灣的曠地上，一個大布蓬，下邊放着一個半圓的木櫃子，一架家庭影戲機，一副舊得可憐的小摩打，這樣成　了一座一街頭影戲院」。</p>
<p>「唦唦，滴滴噹，唦唦，滴滴噹……」小摩打喘着氣。</p>
<p>「阿要四個銅板着一看，阿要着義通軍打東洋人……」這是活動的廣告</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>坐在那裏捲片子的人拚命的呌着。</p>
<p>這兒的觀衆不到外邊尋快活的少奶奶太太，更不是戴禮帽拿「司的克」的紳士，或手兒拖着手兒的穿得漂亮的靑年男女。　兒的觀衆是穿得不整齊的但是臂膀兒粗粗的普遍的大衆，他們整年的做着工，他們的生活是太苦了，在這僅有的假日裏，他們要快活一下了，他們要尋求一種安慰，他們便花四個銅子來看一看影戲，因爲他們是上不起影戲院的。</p>
<p>在交了四個銅子之後，我也被領到一個洞口的前面，坐在一條大約三寸寬的板凳上。帶我的那個人把擊着銅錢的。綫兒一拉，掩着洞口的布便被拉子起來。於是，木櫃子裏的情形便一一映入於眼裏。櫃内張着一個小布幕，其他便空無一物了。櫃子的外邊，開了十多個洞子，這是給觀衆看戲的。</p>
<p>我看的是一套義勇軍和日本軍隊打仗的短片。没有什麽主角，主角就是「義勇軍」和「日本軍」。情節是很簡單的。日本軍用大砲機關槍去打義勇軍，義勇軍給打敗了；可是義勇軍有矛有大刀，而且有許許多多的人，於是後來便反攻了，終於打勝了日本軍，這樣就完了。　　雖然片子是這樣簡單，映得這樣朦朧不淸楚，小摩打老是一唦唦，滴滴噹······」的呌囂着　，可是，許多人都津津有味的在看着。放映到義勇軍反攻的時候，有幾個人竟然呌起來了。在映完之後，有些人在咒駡着，他們要「操」東洋人的「十八代祖宗」……。從這裏，我意識着這種電影的効果。</p>
<p>我不由的想起現在的電影來。究竟現在的電影是什麽樣兒的呢？讓我去巡視一下罷。</p>
<p>只要你由影戲院的門口走過時，電柱呼，年紅燈呀，大幅的廣告呀……它們會捉住你的注意的；可是，當你看淸楚的時候，你總會看到「香艷鉅片」，「熱到絶頂」，「肉感」，「酥胸」，「雪腿」西…這一類字樣的。這一類的電影完全成爲小姐少爺的消遺品了。我們的「爲藝術而藝術」的「藝術家」，把一切的東…都「藝術化」了，給小姐少爺們消悉解悶去了，我們的「藝術家」是什麽都不理的，因了要得少爺小姐們的歡心，就算歪曲了事實，他也不理的。</p>
<p>這樣的電影有什麽用處呢？</p>
<p>雖然最近說是有許多比較「進步的其實仍然免不了盡粉飾，歪曲的作用）影片出現了，但　也是不擠事的。譬如，在這　方多難之秋，我們最急切的問題就是怎樣爲民族的解放，獨立而鬥爭，這，當然不是少數的少爺小姐的事情，而是要全國的民衆起來去幹的，現在的電影能够負起這個宣傳·鼓動的責任麽？而且，就算有了好影片，在目前也是不能達到一般大衆之前的。表面上看來，戲院是很隨便的地方，誰都有入戲院裏的機會；其實呢？其實影戲院是掛着「無錢不得入内」的牌子的，那麽，深入羣衆這任務，目前的電影又怎能實現呢？</p>
<p>自從看見這「街頭影戲院」後，令我想起了「電影大衆化」的問題；這，自然不但指片子的内容，而且也包括形式—演出的形式在裏面的，卽是說，使每一個人都有看到的機會。</p>

<h3 id="c289">無輪的球形火車 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 一奇</p>
<p>曾經在一本雜誌上看見了一個最新式的火車式樣，說是速度最快，樣式頂特别，但可惜没有告訴我們是怎麽一回事。</p>
<p>後來聽人說這是不用車輪的火車，這就更奇怪了，一列火車不要輪子，那不是等於魚没有鰭，鳥没有翅，馬没有腿麽？</p>
<p>但是，這是兩三年前的觀點，現在呢，已由理論而至於完全實現了，從莫斯科到諾更斯克，就有這樣的一種火車呌「球形火車」，牠的番號是「ＳＨ—４—」，今年正式的開始「載運各貨」了。</p>
<p>這個「球形火車」的模型是開始試行於離莫斯科幾基羅米達的雅莫邱克（Ｙａｒｍｏｌｃｈｕｋ），牠可以讓你坐一坐，而且開走起來使你大吃一驚，牠的速度，轉身的靈便，都非尋常火車可比。牠的軌道是槽形，廣十二生的米突，用最有硬性的三合土製成。</p>
<p>火車本身是脚踏車，電車和水雷等有趣的構合。火車的雪茄形是最能减少空氣的抵抗力，而達到牠最高的速度。</p>
<p>在火車底下有兩隻大圓球，前後各一，光滑異常。在轉頭的時候像搖船一樣掉開一邊。這種轉身你要是初次乘坐的話，會使你大吃一驚，以爲火車顚覆了呢。</p>
<p>這火車的速度是每點鐘達二百五十到三百基羅米突，四五倍於普通最快的快車。</p>
<p>蘇聯是一個地大物博的國家，從甲城到乙城是需要非常多的時日，有了這個火車，這時間當然會縮短，不用多少天而用多少點鐘來計算　了。比如說，一個人住在隔莫斯科一百五十到二百基羅米突遠的地方，他就很可以到莫斯科來看夜戲，回去還同平常時間一樣去睡覺，這完全不是想像的事！</p>
<p>這種球形火車將克服距離與時間！</p>

<p>北般島（ＮｏｒｄａＢｏｒｎｅｏ—ｉｎｓｕｌｓ）有人稱之爲婆羅洲，爲英屬馬來民族殖民地。其最大的海港是山打根（Ｓａｎｄａｋａｎｏ），次則阿卑，豆歐。以木材出產爲最大宗，橡榕次之，檳榔，椰子，鹹魚及果實又次之。每年由中國運來之「猪仔」（卽苦工，奴役之意）不下一萬八千之衆。大多數是被擠到山巴裏伐大木和採像榕等工作。他們每天的工作時間總在十小時以上，而勞働的代價每月祇有十餘元，並且還要經受猪仔頭（工頭）的幾重盤剝。然以氣的乾燥，生活的困苦，且山巴中之山嵐瘴氣，猛獸毒蛇…因面致死者日有所聞（所謂死猪仔）。實在的，他們被擠到山巴裏來，卽使有天大的本領也無返祖國的希望了。祗有遙遙企望業岸的祖國影子而已。命運决定：一生都是猪仔，一生都是奴隸，死而後已。</p>
<p>在山巴裏，猪仔頭—外國資本家的馴狗，倒是非常聰明，每當黄昏夜晚，則大開其鴉片烟局，番攤，牌九，鬭牛…吸收了大批的猪仔大家聚集着。他們說這是調劑工人的枯燥生活。鴉片烟是可以賒，甚至賭錢也可以借。他們的烟賭是很有地利的，就是有「馬打」到來也不要緊，因爲猪仔頭已請准於老板（英國人）的了。更確切的說，馬打是收過「使用」的。</p>
<p>星期日，照例是休息的了，是猪仔頭財源廣進的日子，是他們所開設的烟局賭塲生意最好的天天。然有些工人也會趁小火輪出埠—山打根來玩一回，或者去嫖一次，調節一下性的枯燥。但是起碼要十塊錢才行，如果猪仔頭肯担保賒賬也可以。</p>
<p>山打根是北般島的一個所謂最大的海港，是進各山巴必經的路口，與各埠交通的總門户。經常由香港來此有兩艘船—渣甸公司之顯生和茂生。其餘由星加坡，小吕宋及一些野鷄船每月總有幾艘駛來。入口是一些雜貨，出口是大木，椰子，橡榕，果實······等。山打根在外表看來是像一條鄉村。居民是馬來土人和中國人佔大多數。交通方面，在陸地没有電車，也没有黄包車，祇有三數輛的汽車是給政府的英國官員乘坐的。水面交通都是一些獨木舟，長龍，是運貨品的，而儎人的祇有兩艘沙艇，是廣東蛋家妹划的。郵政局是用木架成的一間小木屋，凡受信人都要親自去探聽有否自已的信，並且要親自去領取，因爲郵局不設郵差的。有一條大馬路和三條横街。店舖大多是中國人開的，也有馬來人開的。中國人的店最大的是萬和園辦莊，聽說有幾百萬的資本。還有一間西盛金舖也是華人開的。其次便是食物館，茶居，雜貨店，鴉片烟局，一所大賭塲，和十六間中國妓院，一間日本人開的淸水御，一間日本人開的淸水御料理及一間寫着大字母Ｚ０·３的日本妓院。在這一方面看來，山打根實在是有幾分蒙脫卡羅的氣味。居留着山打根本埠的中國人，除了一些館員店役妓女以外，就是那些「撈家」和一些所謂「大笠佬」了。撈家專靠賭錢過活，他們手頭上非有本錢是不足以當的。所謂大笠佬是指那有錢的人，如店舖的老板，妓院的龜公，大賭塲裏的東家，甚至猪仔頭也稱在其内。山打根的經濟權威全握在他們的手裏。至於山打根的行政權，則是在英國人所組成的北般島總督及本埠政府。政府裏設有華民政務司，專理華人一切政務，司長也是英國人當的。中國人也有一個有權威的林民鼎（文澄），是當地的紳士，高等的華人，北般島山打根的中國人都如領事般的看待他。北般島華僑的情形大槪如此。</p>

<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu telegraphed to Beiping stating he is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing this month, meet with Wang Jingwei, then head north. Yin Tong has accompanied the Japanese, Banxi, to Shanghai to visit Huang. He first dispatched his secretary, Tai Guangdian, carrying the through-train plan northward to confer with Deputy Director Xu Wenguo on organizing an international travel agency. The Sino-Japanese technical meeting on through-train service in Beidaihe recently concluded. Afterwards, Chen Qingwen, the head of the North Ning Road transportation department, and participating personnel, went to Yuguan to inspect. The South Manchuria Railway representative returned to Shenyang from Yuguan.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Ping-Shen through train service, Deputy Director Xu Wenguo of the North Ning Road, Transportation Department Head Chen Wenqing, and others went to Beidaihe to tentatively discuss through-train service methods with Ota, a representative of the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company. The content leaned towards technical cooperation. They plan to establish joint transportation stations in Beiping, Fengtai, Tianjin, Tangshan, Yuguan, Jin County, Goubangzi, Shenyang, and other places to sell direct through tickets. The driving regulations and unloading regulations at intermediate stations have been largely agreed upon and will be implemented once formal procedures are completed. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain news agency, Arima is in Shanghai and will soon discuss resolving North China's outstanding issues with Huang Fu, and will visit the National Government's diplomatic authorities in Nanjing within days. The result of the discussions between Foreign Minister Hirota and Arima on diplomacy toward China included a decision to have Arima bring an entire plan to separately visit important figures in Nanjing and Jiangxi, to comprehensively resolve the two hundred-plus outstanding issues accumulated between China and Japan over the past decades and establish a new relationship.

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military attaché Shibayama met with a reporter from the "North China Daily News" today and stated that the Sino-Manchu through-train agreement will be completed before the end of this month. An agreement has been reached on the matter of allocating railway guards, but details cannot yet be released. Negotiations on customs and postal services are reportedly progressing smoothly, but no decisions have been made yet. When asked about the current situation in Rehe, Shibayama replied that the two railway trunk lines from Chaoyang to Chifeng and from Chaoyang to Chengde are currently under construction. As for the plan to connect Chengde and Dolonnur by railway, it is not likely to be realized in the immediate future, but the road to Tongxi is currently being repaired so that automobiles can travel on it. The Rehe-Chahar border remains quiet for now. Once the through-train issue is resolved, relations between Japan and the authorities in North China should gradually improve. Shibayama denied that Japan intends to transfer the commerce of Hebei Province to "Manchukuo," but admitted that the "Manchu" government intends to seize Hebei Province's trade with Rehe. Shibayama's remarks are quite optimistic about the future, proving that Japan has already achieved many of its demands and does not seem to be planning any action.

<p>(Tokyo) A Nanjing telegram from the 30th reported that the National Government's Executive Yuan decided to reorganize foreign debt and begin discussions separately with various countries. The Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities welcomed this, saying, "Although various countries wanted to reinvest in China or provide financial assistance because of the Yin Company case and others, China's old debts were not reorganized, hindering practical success. The Chinese side understands this matter, so this move is proof of approaching Japan's claims. China itself also realizes that in order to seek reconstruction, it is necessary to start reorganizing old debts, so there is a gradual possibility of understanding Japan's sincerity in its China policy," etc. It also stated that if the Chinese side proposes a method of coordinating the reorganization of old debts, it will respond sincerely and be prepared to effectively discuss and resolve various outstanding issues.

<h3 id="e13">Famous Archaeologist; Sven Hedin Escapes Danger; From Ma Zhongying's Army <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>⊙According to the "City of Stockholm Newspaper" of Sweden, the famous archaeologist Dr. Sven Hedin set off in October 1933 to explore the inland of Asia in order to find a road for automobiles to pass through. Afterwards, there was no news. It is now learned that Dr. Hedin encountered difficulties in the area of fierce fighting between the Xinjiang Provincial Army and the rebel army of Ma Zhongying. Not only was the exploration team shot at by the rebels several times, but Dr. Hedin himself was also detained in the Gholla area. At the same time, all vehicles were robbed, and four drivers, two Swedish and two Mongolian, were taken to serve by force. It was not until Easter of this year, when Ma's army was defeated, that Dr. Hedin and his expedition team were able to regain their freedom and continue their work. According to reports, Dr. Sven Hedin is Swedish, 69 years old, has been in China for 48 years, and has conducted scientific investigations in the Northwest many times. On Double Ten Day last year, he received 50,000 yuan from the National Government and led a team of seven members to set off from Beiping, commissioned by the Ministry of Railways to explore the Sui-Xin Highway. He arrived in Suiyuan on the 22nd of that month, and Fu Zuoyi hosted a banquet for him. On the 24th, he went west from Suiyuan across the Daqing Mountains. It is said that the Sui-Xin exploration route is divided into north and south routes, and this trip will first explore the north route, that is, the line from Alashan through Hami to Dihua. At the end of December, he arrived at Aite Zhai Ghor (near the junction of Mongolia and Xinjiang). At the end of January, he set off for Hami. Just as the war between Sheng Shicai and Ma Zhongying broke out in Xinjiang, the whole Xinjiang was restless. Hedin's whereabouts were unknown. It was not until this time that the City of Stockholm of Sweden first received the above-mentioned telegram that he learned where he was. (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙At the end of January this year, Dr. Hedin, a great explorer, led a team from Aite Zhai Ghor to Xinjiang to explore a road for the Chinese government to enable the products of the northwest provinces to be transported to the coast through a shortcut. The team's whereabouts have been unknown recently. Now it is learned that the team encountered great difficulties after leaving Aite Zhai Ghor. Later, Zhongying detained them in Gholla, and Ma treated them very harshly. All the cars were requisitioned, and two Swedish drivers and two Mongolian drivers were forced to serve him for 16 days. It was not until Easter that the provincial army defeated Ma's army, and the doctor and others were freed. After a little rest, they reorganized the team and moved forward again. The purpose of this trip is to build a car road from Xinjiang to the Yellow Sea. According to reports, Hedin led his scientific expedition team, consisting of several members, and a number of Chinese staff, including several road construction experts, from Beiping in October last year. The entire team arrived near Aite Zhai Ghor around Christmas, encountering obstacles along the way. He set off for Hami at the end of January, and only today did we receive a telegram from him here.

<h3 id="e14">The Trend of the International Situation and the Far East Question <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Today, the powder kegs sufficient to ignite a second world war are located in the Far East and in Western Europe. In the Far East, the Sino-Japanese question forms the core, with England, America, Russia and France, whose interests are involved in the Far East, as supporting roles. In Western Europe, France and Germany are the center, with England, Russia, Italy, the Little Entente and the Balkan countries as supporting roles. Among these countries, England and Russia are concerned about the Far East question, but cannot but also consider the West European question. England has territories all over the world. Strictly speaking, it is not a purely European country. Its territories in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, such as India, the Malay Peninsula, North Borneo, and Australia and New Zealand, are all greatly related to the survival of the British Empire. It cannot focus on the European continent question and ignore the Far East. Soviet Russia straddles Europe and Asia, and is threatened by militarist countries in both the East and the West. Therefore, its national policy cannot focus on one side. Moreover, this is especially true in today's context of the Japanese-German pact. Such is the position of England and Russia. Therefore, there is a risk that the two major powder kegs in the East and West may explode one after another, evolving into an unprecedented great world war.</p>
<p>This kind of situation is becoming increasingly clear today. Judging from the recent development of international politics, several points can be foreseen. 1) The combination of Russia and France has become a reality. Russia has taken this step not only to defend against Germany, but also to confront Japan. Although France's main motive in taking this step lies in confronting Germany, it will inevitably indirectly form a situation of confronting Japan at the same time. Thus, Japan and Germany form one group, and Russia and France also form one group. A war between Japan and Russia can trigger a war between France and Germany. A war between France and Germany also carries the risk that Japan and Russia will be drawn into the vortex.</p>
<p>2) The relationship between England and France is becoming increasingly estranged. England has once expressed disgust towards Hitler of Germany. However, what it dislikes is the dictatorial politics as the object. For England to control France, it still has to support Germany. Now that France has allied with Russia, its plan to support Germany and suppress France will inevitably be greatly reduced. Because of this, deepening Anglo-German friendship or slightly improving Anglo-Japanese relations are all possible. If England has business in the West, it is feared that it will be difficult to take care of the defense of its eastern territories. It must obtain Japan's goodwill and understanding in advance, or it will have a sense of unease even while sleeping. Previously, Foreign Minister Simon misinterpreted the Nine-Power Treaty and was unwilling to openly criticize Japan, all because he wanted to leave a margin for reconciliation with Japan in the midst of the Anglo-Japanese trade war. However, if England sides with Japan, the situation in the Far East will undergo major changes. At that time, the handling of the Far East question will be entirely up to Japan's lead. Whether the United States can independently come forward to restrain Japan will become a major question. If the Japanese are not restrained by England and the United States, they can even boldly ally with Germany to confront Russia. The brewing of the Japanese-Russian war will become more and more mature as a result, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>The above is the result of our speculation based on the general trend of international affairs. Even if it is not accurate, it must not be far off. Some people take</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) Zhang Ji arrived in Xuzhou from Nanjing on the morning of the 2nd and toured Yunlong Mountain, Fanghe Pavilion, Kuai Zai Pavilion, and Yanzi Building. At noon, he transferred to the Longhai train westward. According to what he told reporters, he is going to Xi'an for inspection. He returned from Fujian not long ago, and the situation in South China is very good. The Red Bandits can be gradually eliminated. The situation in North China is now extremely critical, and the internal affairs should be settled as soon as possible in preparation for resisting aggression. In short, in this time of serious national crisis, we should actively promote production, eliminate internal troubles, pay attention to national defense, and enrich national strength so that we can cope with the crisis. The Xuzhou area is crucial in terms of transportation and national defense, and we should especially work hard to afforest, dredge rivers, build roads, and cultivate civil military power. The local government should not allow any factions to arise, control all construction projects, and keep the streets of Xuzhou tidy and clean. The police's advice to pedestrians to walk on the left side is refreshing and commendable. (2nd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Concerning the present League of Nations, a type of international conspiracy such as the secret treaties of offensive and defensive alliances concluded before the last Great War will probably not be revived. It is widely known that the League of Nations was originally a tool for a few powerful European nations to manipulate weaker ones. However, in order to manipulate it freely, they must unite with many countries, forming a group. In peacetime, they seek a majority in conferences; in wartime, they advance as allies on the battlefield. Looking at France's diplomatic gains today, the Little Entente and the Balkan countries have all become deeply enmeshed. If Russia is added, its influence in the League of Nations will be even greater, surpassing that of countries with votes from various "autonomous territories," which is something Britain dislikes. If the cracks between the two major pillars of the League of Nations, Britain and France, deepen daily, then the decline of the League of Nations will inevitably be a matter of time. The League of Nations is not a supreme state. Its life is firmly in the hands of Britain, France, and a few powerful nations. These few powerful nations will let it exist if they want it to, and let it perish if they want it to. They will use it if it is convenient for them, and destroy it if it is not. Therefore, the League of Nations itself can hardly prevent the revival of international offensive and defensive alliances and secret treaties. Whether or not a second world war descends is even beyond the control of the League of Nations. Given the deep and thorough relationship between the international situation and the Far Eastern question, can the people of our country, both in and out of government, not plan countermeasures early?</p>

<h3 id="e23">Roosevelt's Message to Congress: Announces War Debt Policy, Warns Against Arms Expansion; British and American Opinions See No Change <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today sent a war debt message to Congress, warning all countries that the United States' judgment on the responsibilities of debtor nations will depend on the extent to which each country's finances are used for military equipment and other unproductive purposes. The message mainly states the current status of the debts and emphasizes that the U.S. government hopes that all debtor nations fully understand the U.S. attitude. It also states that the government is becoming impatient with the fact that demanding the payment of legitimate debts is viewed as exploitation. What is noteworthy in the message is that the President skillfully avoids the issue of reducing war debts and does not explain, through various interpretations of the Johnson Act, whether the government will accept credit payments for the debt due in mid-June. President Roosevelt explained that all debts were borrowed by the United States from its people, and if countries stop paying, the government will have to increase the tax burden on the American people to make up the shortfall. What needs to be paid now are Liberty Bonds, and in the future, there will be Compensation Bonds. The message begins with the suspension of payments approved by Congress in June 1932, based on President Hoover's suggestion. This event was later called the Hoover Moratorium. The President then recounted the British note of December 11, 1932, which stated that the payments made by Britain at that time should not be considered a resumption of annual payments but as part of the total debt. The then Secretary of State Stimson replied that the American President had no authority to revise the terms of debt repayment. President Roosevelt discussed the situation in France, briefly stating that on January 20, 1933, he and Hoover jointly issued a statement reiterating the principle that debtor nations are free to appeal to creditor nations, but discussions must be conducted individually. Regarding the British debt, the President said that although he had held several informal discussions with the British Ambassador before March 4, 1933, and again with British Prime Minister MacDonald in April of the same year, no concrete results were achieved. Experts from both countries also consulted with each other at that time. The message then described how debtor nations were allowed to repay with silver and explained the discussions held in Washington in October 1933. Subsequently, Britain acknowledged the debt and repaid the December installment of US$7.51 million. After reviewing the past negotiations, the President said that the United States will continue to hope that debtor nations can fully understand the American attitude towards the war debt issue. The President stated that the people of debtor nations must remember that the American people will decide whether to use resources for recovery projects and substantial debt repayment, or solely for unproductive expenditures and encouraging nationalism. The message concludes: "The American people do not wish to impose impossible burdens on debtor nations, but their demand that all countries make every possible sacrifice to repay their debts is indeed fair." President Roosevelt also stated in his message that American debt has no connection with the repayment or arrears of war debts to other countries, and declared that each debtor nation still has the opportunity to discuss its problems with the United States.

<p>(London) Today, all British newspapers stated that President Roosevelt's war debt message had not changed the situation. The London Times stated that there seemed to be nothing that could be done at present, except to pay some amount, while keeping the issue open. The amount paid should not be too large, so as not to hinder exchange rates. At the same time, creditor nations should be urged to propose a final solution that takes into account the current reality and future economic consequences. British newspapers mostly said that Britain will send a note to the U.S. government at the end of this week, stating that Britain is willing to make another credit payment, but it must be accompanied by a strict understanding that this action should not be regarded as a failure to fulfill obligations. It is reported that this note will reiterate the principles in the Balfour Note, explaining that Britain is unwilling to repay debts for other countries forever, and requesting that a conference be convened as soon as possible to resolve this war debt issue. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) The New York Times today summarized the status of the war debt, saying that President Roosevelt's message has not changed the old situation. The British newspapers here hold the view that this message will completely suspend the debt due on June 15. President Roosevelt did not take any steps that could dispel this view. A certain American official who had closely participated in the Anglo-American war debt talks said that Britain will still pay a sum of money to show credit, because some people in Britain advocate respecting government obligations to the best of their ability. The diplomatic community mostly agrees with this view, believing that President Roosevelt will accept the credit payment without mentioning the issue of non-performance. Deputy Secretary of State Philips said today that he has not heard what actions the debtor nations will take. The New York Times added a criticism after reporting the above news, saying that President Roosevelt's message will be disappointing, especially to Britain. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain had hoped that President Roosevelt would provide some guidance, but now he sees that President Roosevelt is limited by the public opinion here and cannot point out a way to break the deadlock, causing the situation to remain tense. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the French side's observation of President Roosevelt's war debt message, Roosevelt's message does not provide any new instructions for the future progress of the issue of debts owed to the United States by various countries. (2nd Havas)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Last night, British Foreign Secretary Simon suddenly announced his return home, with Lord Privy Seal Eden attending the Disarmament Conference in his place. Like a bolt from the blue, all parties to the conference were greatly shocked. Generally, people believe that Simon's actions are clearly aimed at France, further proving the hopelessness of the situation. The total collapse of the Disarmament Conference now seems inevitable. The British delegation declared that a new and important development might make Simon reconsider his decision, so some believe this statement to be a glimmer of hope. However, given that the Soviet Union, the Little Entente, and Turkey all sympathize with France's security demands and oppose the British proposal to conclude a preliminary convention, the hope for a change in the stalemate is very slim. The French faction advocates convening the political committee of the Disarmament Conference to discuss security issues and study the British proposal to establish a permanent disarmament commission. In this way, the conference can be extended to September. However, Britain firmly opposes this strategy. With the situation at such a standstill, only a divine being can save it.

<p>(London) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, in Geneva, advocated changing the Disarmament Conference into a "Permanent Conference for Safeguarding Peace." British Foreign Secretary Simon advocated establishing a permanent disarmament commission. The former is political in nature, while the latter is technical. It seems possible to merge the two institutions. People here are very supportive of this news, but some say that Britain will probably propose to conclude a European security pact based on the "concentric circles" principle, so that the Soviet Foreign Commissar's proposal is closely linked to the suggestion that Britain will propose.

<p>Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, representing Sweden, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland, spoke, attempting to find a compromise on disarmament, proposing a procedure to genuinely reduce armaments and increase security, divided into five points as follows: (1) Immediately organize a special committee to study the issue of security and its implementation, in order to strengthen security to some extent beyond the British draft, and the various amendments in the British draft are of great importance. (2) The core department of the Disarmament Conference should study the supervision of the arms trade. (3) To facilitate the final reading of the draft convention, the core department should revise the contents of the draft convention, including the four matters mentioned by Britain, namely (a) chemical warfare, (b) budget disclosure, (c) permanent disarmament commission, and (d) arms trade. The unconditional prohibition of aerial bombardment, the destruction of some aircraft in two phases, the study of preventing civilian aircraft from being converted to military use, the limitation of artillery caliber, and the destruction of tanks and land-based mobile artillery positions in the second phase, as stated in the British memorandum of January 29, are also included. (4) In order to prevent a general increase in armaments, the core department should specify the numbers of land and air forces and war equipment in the draft convention. (5) Since all matters must be discussed with various countries, and Germany is not participating in the conference, the core department must have the authority to take any steps that would allow it to complete the draft convention for all countries. The above is Sandler's proposal. British Foreign Secretary Simon, upon hearing this, claimed that he would return to London because there was no concrete proposal. French Foreign Minister Barthou merely shrugged his shoulders. American representative Davis also only gave a weak compliment, saying it was quite interesting.</p>

It is said that Gamelin himself has no intention of going to Russia, but will send a military delegation, whose leader will be either the Director General of Ordnance or the Director General of Gun Manufacturing.

The report also studies the illegal trafficking of narcotics in the United States, Central America, Uruguay, France, Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, China, and French Indochina, pointing out that the penalties for illegal trafficking of narcotics in some countries are too lenient. (2) The report submitted by the Mixed Subcommittee and the Health Committee reviewing the original text of Article 10 of the Bangkok Agreement (concluded on November 27, 1931) (regarding suggestions for scientific research), advocating that the countries concerned establish coordination, select a location in the Far East, and convene the most qualified experts to conduct on-site research.

<p>(Geneva) The Saar plebiscite issue has recently been resolved after repeated consultations between representatives of France, Germany, and Italy. The date of the vote has been set for January 13, 1935, the earliest possible date next year. This solution was reached after first determining the security of the Saar residents and then deciding on the date. Saar voters will be guaranteed by the League of Nations, regardless of which country the Saar territory belongs to in the future. According to the compromise reached this time, neither the German state, its agencies, nor its civil servants shall take retaliatory action or discriminate against voters after the vote. If, after this clear reinstatement, there are still people who treat voters in the aforementioned ways, the victims can file a complaint with the "Voting Court" within one year. This court will be located in the Saar for the first year, and then its functions will be performed by the League of Nations Administrative Council and the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, with no expiration date. (1st Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A conference between Germany and France, previously mediated by Italy, has reached a complete agreement after several days of mediation. The agreement has now been approved by the German government, setting January 13, 1935, as the date for the Saar region's plebiscite. This date is also the latest possible date stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles. Other matters in the agreement stipulate that the police force during the voting period shall be entirely composed of Saar residents, and foreign senior police officers may only be added in times of danger. Both Germany and France guarantee the absolute freedom of voting, prohibiting all retaliatory actions, but only legal residents of the Saar region are included, while expatriates currently residing in the Saar are not. However, the League of Nations Council still has the right to expand the scope of guarantees in the future. In addition, a special international court will be organized during the voting period to hear various voting cases within three months after the vote. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Associated Press received news from reliable sources in France and Germany confirming that the Saar self-determination vote will be held on January 13, 1935. Opponents of Hitler in the Saar region strongly advocate postponing the self-determination vote, arguing that the National Socialist Party's agitation of terror and retaliation movements prevents people from voting freely. However, the League of Nations has decided to hold the self-determination vote according to the original date. The Saar Governing Commission and French and German diplomats have agreed on the following measures for the self-determination vote: (1) The two governments promise to avoid threats, retaliation, or discrimination, and prohibit their representatives or people from adopting these measures. (2) If citizens of the Saar region are harmed by retaliation, they may appeal to the Voting Court. This court will be maintained until one year after the vote, after which people may appeal to the League of Nations Administrative Council or the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

<p>(Washington) The President's desk is piled high today with letters and telegrams from all over the country calling on President Roosevelt to personally mediate labor disputes, as the failure to resolve the labor unrest in various places quickly will bring a large portion of American industry to a standstill. Labor leaders are confident that the President will return to the White House from New York on Monday and make every effort to mediate the steel and textile industries labor disputes, as there are approximately one million workers involved in these two industries.

Some members of the steelworkers' union claim that unless the President fulfills his promise to implement the unconditional collective bargaining clause in the steel code, a general strike will be implemented next week.

<p>A dispatch from Nanchang states that the military operations to suppress bandits have been consistently victorious. The complete bandit areas in Jiangxi Province consist of only six counties: Ruijin, Huichang, Xingguo, Ningdu, Yudu, and Shicheng. In Fujian, they consist of only Tingzhou, Liancheng, Ninghua, and other counties and semi-bandit areas near those counties. The various routes of the National Army are currently recovering the semi-bandit areas and then clearing out the bandits. Some time ago, the Eastern Route Army under Jiang Dingwen advanced on Tinglian. Now, military reports say that Shuikou, located 60 li from Tingcheng, has been captured. The bandits have built fortifications north of Tinglian, where there is expected to be a fierce battle. As for the Southern Route Army, after capturing Junmenling, in addition to assigning certain units to garrison Yangjiaoying, Luotang, and Junmenling to strictly guard against the Ye Jianying bandit's return attack, the remaining forces are advancing on Huichang via different routes. The Li Zhenqiu units have reached the Yushui area, several dozen li from Huichang, and the city of Huichang is expected to fall soon. After the Northern Route Army recovered Guangchang and Longgang, they approached Ningdu and Xingguo. It is reported that a certain unit has crossed Guangchang to take Shicheng, advancing in tandem with the Eastern Route Army, which is taking Ninghua from Jianning. Another unit is flanking Wangpo Xiaopu, joining forces with a certain route army that has reached Longgang to attack Ningdu. The Western Route Army is actively clearing out the fleeing remnants of Xiao Ke, Cai Huiwen, and Kong Hechong along the west bank of the Gan River to avoid any constraints. At the same time, certain units are ordered to build fortifications along the Gan River in the Wan'an, Taihe, and Ji'an areas to strengthen the blockade. Because the Red bandits are now surrounded by the armies of four provinces, they have a plan to break through a bloody path from Xingguo, break through the Gan River from Wan'an and Taihe, escape the encirclement, and seek a new way out. The Western Route Army must make arrangements to defend and block on both sides of the Gan River. (May 31st)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Shenyang reports that the various volunteer armies in the counties of An'tu, Ji'an, Huanren, and the Sandaohe area in western Liaoning are actively operating. The Japanese Kwantung Army dispatched the Morita, Hamamoto, and Saito regiments to attack, suffering repeated heavy losses. Over 50 Japanese officers and soldiers were killed or wounded. The leader of the volunteer army besieging An'tu and Ji'an counties, nicknamed "Loyal Hero," is extremely resolute in his will to punish the puppets and resist Japan. The following is a detailed account of the volunteer army's resistance against the enemy:</p>
<p>In the Sandaohe area of western Liaoning, over 700 volunteer soldiers suddenly appeared. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese Kwantung Army immediately dispatched the Morita unit, consisting of over 300 soldiers, to Sandaohe Bamian, located 10 li south of Tong, on a military train on May 26th. By about 3:00 PM, they began engaging the volunteer army in that area. The volunteer army launched a fierce attack, and the battle lasted until late at night. Because the Japanese army was unfamiliar with the terrain, they were flanked by the volunteer army, which encircled them for several hours. Over 20 Japanese soldiers were killed, and five machine guns, over 30 rifles, and a large amount of ammunition were seized. Over 1,000 volunteer soldiers, whom the Japanese call the "Red Army," were discovered in the Xiaoshahe area northwest of An'tu County. This volunteer army operates swiftly, is well-equipped with ammunition, and has new weapons. On the 24th of last month, they occupied Dashahe. On the 26th, they advanced towards Huanghezi. They are currently planning to capture An'tu County, and the Japanese puppet army and police are on high alert.</p>
<p>The volunteer army leaders, nicknamed "Fairness" and "Loyal Hero," who are lurking in the Gaoliyingzi area of Ji'an County and the Lichagou area of Huanren County, have each led their respective units of over 500 soldiers to take unified action to capture Ji'an County in an attempt to launch a major operation. Small groups of volunteer soldiers are responding to the call every day. The leaders have declared that they have nothing to fear from the Japanese puppet army. On the 21st, the Japanese army dispatched the Hamamoto company and the Saito regiment to attack, engaging in fierce battles for a day and a night, killing Japanese officers Lieutenant Kurokawa Yukio and Second Lieutenant Ichino Yukifuku, as well as over ten soldiers. The volunteer army also suffered over ten casualties. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Internal Split Among the Jiangxi Bandits: Zhou Enlai and Peng Dehuai Have Conflicting Opinions on Military Strategy; The Eighth Division of the Southern Route Army Captures the Qianfeng Ao Bandit Stronghold <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou reports that the communist bandits in eastern Jiangxi have suffered significant losses since their defeat at Junmen. Recently, the Eastern Route Army has been closing in on Changting, and the First and Second Columns of the Southern Route Army have established contact, imposing a strict blockade on Huichang, Yudu, and other areas. As a result, the communist bandit leaders have been holding meetings for several days, urgently seeking ways to flee. According to military news, the remaining communists in Jiangxi, recently realizing that the environment is becoming increasingly dangerous, have decided to implement their plan to avoid the strong and attack the weak, concentrating their forces in one corner. If the Eastern and Southern Route Armies press forward, they plan to cross into western Jiangxi, joining forces with the remaining bandits in eastern Hunan and along the Yangtze River to prolong their existence. The communist bandit leaders recently held a meeting in Ruijin. Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the Communist Bandit Puppet Military Commission, strongly advocated for this proposal. His reason was that the natural barrier of Junmen had been lost, and the defenses of the bandit areas of Huichang and Ruijin had been dismantled. If the National Army were to surround them from all sides, they would have no way out. They plan to first focus on one route of bandit troops in order to break through and preserve some remaining strength. However, the bandit leaders Luo Binghui and Peng Dehuai believe that the western Jiangxi region is barren and difficult to develop. They plan to invade northern Fujian or seek to enter Zhejiang Province. Internal opinions are highly divided.</p>
<p>The First and Second Columns of the Southern Route Army have recently increased their troop strength on the front lines, and the heavy artillery unit of the Shidivision has been deployed to the front lines. The communist bandits will be hard-pressed to launch a counterattack. South of Junmen, they are actively handling the aftermath, rushing to set up anti-communist groups and conducting strict household registration to prevent the remnants of the bandits from blending in. All grains, kerosene, salt, and other items in the area are prohibited from being sold out of the area to supply the bandits. The supply of salt is distributed according to the people's registration book, with each person receiving three qian per day to limit consumption. As for food, public sales offices are also established to implement public sales. Refugees who return must register in the Baojia system and implement the five-household mutual guarantee system to prevent malfeasance. As for the units on the front lines, before launching a major offensive, they are striving to search for remnants of bandits to avoid leaving future troubles. On the 21st of this month, it was discovered that there were over 1,000 bandits entrenched in Qianfeng Ao, north of Junmen. The 22nd and 24th Regiments of the Eighth Division were dispatched to surround the area. From 9:00 AM, they began bombarding the Qianfeng Ao bandit stronghold, and by 11:00 AM, they had captured the stronghold. The remaining bandits retreated towards Qingxi. On the 23rd, the Kou Division, stationed near Gan County, discovered a communist bandit puppet guerrilla battalion in Datian. They dispatched the Zeng Zhaoji battalion of the teaching regiment and the Hualin Temple reserve team to cross the river and surround and suppress them. The puppet battalion commander, Zhong Decai, and nine others were captured, and over 100 villagers who had been coerced into service by the bandits were rescued. Also, on the 21st, the First Division, stationed at Chongshiwei, received a report that hundreds of bandits from the Bao Wei Ju puppet guerrilla team were massacring wealthy farmers near Gaopai. They immediately dispatched the Wen and Liang battalions to suppress them overnight. As a result, three bandit leaders were killed, and over 200 hostages were rescued. The National Army is still searching the area. (May 28th)</p>

<p>Chen Wanren telegraphed that the He bandits had collapsed without forming a proper army; Tang Shizun reported that the Xu bandits had become fish in a cauldron. A dispatch from Chengdu reports that the He bandits previously crossed into Pengshui in eastern Sichuan, where they were severely attacked by the Chen Division of the 21st Army, which cut the bandits into several segments, rendering them unable to form a proper army. Yesterday, Chen Dunren, the division commander of that division, telegraphed the Anfu Committee to report on the progress of the suppression. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>"To the Chengdu Anfu Committee, regarding the He bandits' invasion of the You area, my unit was ordered to reinforce the area with two regiments of troops, deployed to the right of Guizhou to prevent them from crossing and disrupting the southern bank. At the same time, two regiments of troops were sent to reinforce the Tian unit to encircle and suppress the bandits. Seeing that we were prepared and knowing that they could not succeed, the bandits first crossed from the Guizhou territory to Xiaodong in Zhonglu, and then crossed to Youyang. I immediately ordered the Xu and Chen regiments to pursue them and cooperate with the Tian unit to encircle and suppress them. They had already driven the bandits to their old nest in Baihu Village and Caishengou, near the intersection of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei. Because the troops in Hunan and Hubei were blocking them tightly, the bandits changed their plan, taking advantage of the weakness of our rear defense, and rushed towards Pengshui day and night. At that time, Pengcheng was in the rear, and its defenses were weak, so it was taken by the bandits. Fortunately, my Xu and Chen regiments followed closely, and reinforcements were sent from the rear of Fuling, commanded by Da Brigade, to intercept and suppress them. The bandits then abandoned the city and crossed the river, fleeing towards Huangjiaba. Our army followed again, striking the bandits at the Shimaoba area, forty li from Guizhou Province, dividing the bandits into several segments and dispersing them towards Houping. There are no bandit traces in Sichuan. I am now notifying the troops stationed in Guizhou Province to intercept and suppress them, striving to annihilate them completely and eliminate future troubles. In this battle, the officers and soldiers of the two companies of my garrison in Peng County fought against the bandits, outnumbered but not outmatched, with many killed or wounded. Battalion Commander Shao Hua of the Xian Battalion committed suicide by jumping into the river after being injured out of anger. Several staff members and local gentry were also taken away. After the recovery, I ordered the Xu Regiment to cooperate with the county government to investigate and report the losses. According to the telegram, after the recovery of Pengcheng, a detailed investigation revealed that most of the company and platoon leaders, soldiers, and civilians of the Xian Battalion were killed or wounded. When the bandits retreated, they also took away Vice Chairman Ning Xiangru and over ten gentry and merchants. Public and private losses amounted to over 100,000, and so on. In addition to ordering proper consolation and finding ways to rescue the kidnapped persons as soon as possible, I am sending this telegram to Chen. Chen Wanren, signed with seal."</p>
<p>Tang Shizun also reported on the bandit suppression situation: "Since being encircled and suppressed by various armies, the Xu bandits have suffered repeated heavy losses and have become exhausted. They are like fish in a cauldron, and their capture is imminent. However, it is an ancient saying that one should not pursue desperate foes. Just like suppressing bandits in Jiangxi, although we have already surrounded them, we are advancing steadily, without rushing forward easily. Observing their tactics, it seems that they are imitating the French method of encircling and suppressing Moroccan rebels in recent years, building roads on all sides to surround them in mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation, so that there will be no problems of insufficient transportation or ineffective mobilization. Thus, we can turn a difficult situation into an advantageous one, gaining momentum, while the bandits will become turtles in a jar. I believe that this method is very good. Not only has Chairman Chiang used it effectively, but we should also learn from it in Sichuan to suppress bandits, ensuring that our transportation and supply are not difficult, and then the Red bandits will be easily annihilated. As for how to suppress bandits, it is a military secret and cannot be announced," and so on. (National News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Panic Withdrawals at Hunan Provincial Bank: Traitors Create Rumors to Manipulate the Market; The Withdrawals at the Provincial Bank are Gradually Subsiding <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha reports that Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi flew from Hankou to Hunan last week but left after only a few hours. His hasty movements have led to much speculation among the people of Hunan. Recently, He Jian also left the province by boat on the evening of the 25th for Hankou, then transferred to Jiangxi to visit Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, his son-in-law, Li Jue (currently the commander of the 19th Division and acting commander of the Hunan Provincial Security Force in southern Hunan), was also summoned to Jiangxi by telegram from Chiang Kai-shek to attend the ten-province security conference. As a result, rumors are rampant, and the market is in turmoil. This has affected the Hunan Provincial Bank, leading to panic withdrawals. Ignorant citizens are rushing to cash their banknotes or even refusing to use them. The bank's banknotes circulating in the market are divided into six denominations: 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, 1 yuan, 5 yuan, and 10 yuan, with a total circulation of approximately 4 million yuan, circulating throughout Hunan Province and the western Jiangxi counties. It has always been fully backed by reserves. After the panic withdrawals began on the 28th, the bank manager, Zhao Heng, not only ordered the bank to redeem banknotes without restriction but also entrusted various banks and major money shops to redeem them on its behalf. At the same time, he also had 500,000 yuan in silver stored in Hankou and over 1 million yuan in silver stored in the exchange offices in various counties transported to the Changsha head office on the 29th to meet the demands for redemption. Meanwhile, Hu Da, the commander of the Changsha Garrison, issued an order strictly prohibiting the spread of rumors, and the provincial government issued an order to all counties and cities not to refuse to accept banknotes from the Provincial Bank to facilitate circulation. By the morning of the 30th, there were fewer people withdrawing money than in the previous two days, and the panic may have subsided. A total of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan in cash has been redeemed. Cao Dianqiu, the acting chairman of the provincial government, scheduled a meeting with reporters at the provincial government guest house at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th to explain the rumors and reassure the people. According to Cao Dianqiu, Minister Kong's previous visit to Hunan was indeed to inspect the national taxes of Hunan Province, and there were no other incidents. He Jian and Deputy Commander Li's trip to Jiangxi this time was to attend a meeting summoned by Chairman Chiang, and their families traveled with them to Shanghai for medical treatment, which was purely coincidental and had no other implications. There were also rumors that Deputy Commander Zhang's Northeast Army would enter Hunan, which are even more unfounded. According to reports, the current rumors were created by a small number of unscrupulous merchants in the financial sector, hoping to take advantage of this opportunity to speculate and disrupt the market and financial situation in order to manipulate the rise and fall of exchange rates. They only cared about their personal gain, disregarding the disruption of market order and security, which is truly despicable. Military and police agencies have been ordered to investigate and arrest them strictly. Once caught, they will be prosecuted by military law. The following are the telegram from the provincial government to all counties and bureaus not to refuse to use banknotes and the training order from the provincial garrison headquarters prohibiting rumors: (1) Telegram from the provincial government on circulating banknotes: (1) To the mayor of Changsha City and the county magistrates of all counties: The Hunan Provincial Bank has issued various banknotes with sufficient reserves and is ready to redeem them at any time. Its credit has long been established. Recently, during the tense period of the suppression operations, it is heard that there are traitors and bandits who are creating rumors to undermine and disrupt the financial situation and endanger security. In addition to ordering strict investigation and punishment, if it is found that any county or city is creating rumors to suppress or discount the aforementioned banknotes or refusing to accept them, they must be investigated and severely punished without any negligence or leniency, and the telegram must be immediately posted. Seal of He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government. (2) To the directors of all tax bureaus and the inspectors of all grain and rice offices (omitted above): When paying taxes, the bureau must accept the aforementioned banknotes as much as possible, and no corrupt staff should be allowed to suppress or refuse them, lest they be investigated. Seal of He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government. (2) Garrison Command Training Order to Investigate and Prohibit Rumors: Recently, rumors have been rampant in the city, with various versions circulating. People are imagining things and gossiping in the streets. Upon investigation, there is no factual basis. Those who are clear-minded can easily see that these rumors are unfounded, but the citizens are unaware and are being misled and causing unnecessary trouble. In this situation, it is clear that there are lawless scoundrels mixed in with the common people, creating rumors and confusing the public. If we do not investigate the root cause and punish them severely, it will not be enough to punish the traitors and maintain security. In addition to issuing an order, I hereby order you to comply with and supervise your subordinates to conduct a strict investigation. If you encounter anyone spreading rumors or inquiring about information, arrest them immediately and send them to the department for strict investigation. Once the true situation is obtained, all personnel involved in the effort will be rewarded generously. This matter is of great importance, and you must carry it out earnestly without any leniency. Be sure to comply with this order. (May 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e105">Trends in the Tea Industry in Anhui Province: The Overseas Market is Weak, and the Future of the Tea Market is Pessimistic <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Wuyuan reports that Anhui's Qimen black tea, Zhi De black tea, and Wuyuan Tunxi Shexian green tea have excellent quality and abundance, surpassing the rest of the country, and are the highest-grade teas exported in chests by foreign firms. They have a long history in the overseas market and enjoy a superior position. Wuyuan's "chouxin" tea and Qimen's tribute tea are particularly rare. In the years when the tea market was prosperous, the people of Anhui relied on this naturally abundant and superior specialty for clothing and food. The source of social and economic prosperity was also able to flow steadily without drying up. Unfortunately, prosperity and decline are impermanent. In recent years, the global economic panic has had a severe impact, and the overseas market has undergone drastic changes. Market prices have collapsed, and the trend is rapidly declining. The rural economy, which relies on tea for its livelihood, is on the verge of bankruptcy. The golden age of the past can no longer be sustained. The so-called natural specialty is becoming exhausted. This year's new teas in Anhui Province are about to be launched. The trend of the tea market this year can be glimpsed at this time. The production, quality, mountain prices, firm names, and foreign sales are described in sections to inform readers who are concerned about the tea industry.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Production Losses <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Anhui Province has the earliest history of tea production. The largest output is in Qimen, Wuyuan, Shexian, and Xiuning, followed by Huo County, and then by other counties. The total tea-planting area in Anhui Province accounts for more than one-third of the paddy fields. Because it is related to their livelihood for the year, farmers regard tea as an important secondary industry and do their best to cultivate and fertilize it. In years of bumper harvests, there are approximately 150,000 dan or more of dried tea, worth over 10 million silver dollars. This year, the tea trees on the plains and shady mountain areas in various counties were affected by the heavy snow and severe cold last winter, and most of them were frozen and withered, hindering their growth. According to the latest estimates after the completion of harvesting and processing by various mountain households, there are widespread reports of losses. On average, it is estimated that there are only 120,000 dan, a decrease of about 30,000 dan compared to the past. This huge amount of decline is unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Tea Quality Still Good <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Tea from Anhui province, due to the suitability of its soil and climate, has a quality and flavor superior to that of other provinces. However, the superiority or inferiority of the product changes with the smoothness or adversity of the weather during the new tea plucking season. If, when the tea plant develops, there is much rain and sudden heat, the tea buds will burst forth, and small households will be unable to pick and process them in time, easily leading to withering and aging. If the tea leaves are saturated with rain and cannot be exposed to morning dew, the leaves will be hard and the quality light. Even if tea firms refine this type of product, it will be difficult to make fine tea because the raw materials have already been damaged. If foreign merchants have urgent needs, there may be a chance to get rid of it by luck; otherwise, the danger is very great. This year's new tea, except for the black tea from Qimen and Zhide, which had poor output due to excessive rainfall, the green tea from Wuyuan and Xiuning, although there was continuous rain when the tea buds first emerged, once the tea gardens opened, the weather became sunny and warm, and the climate was mild. The tea plants not only received frequent nourishment from the morning dew, but also allowed the mountain households to pick and process them at their leisure. Therefore, the new tea produced is exceptionally tender, the quality is heavier, and the color and flavor are excellent, truly worthy of being called top grade.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Mountain Prices Increase <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Tea firms depend on the year's business for their livelihood. When mountain households harvest their gardens, they mobilize scouts to search for and buy tea. The tea farmers initially intended that if this year's output was sold at a loss, selling at a high price would mean a double loss of tea price and would inevitably lose money, so they firmly refused to sell. Tea firms, believing that the market was not rising, insisted on agreeing to the limited price before agreeing to trade. After holding out against each other, the mountain households were burdened by economic pressure, and the tea firms, seeing the loss in production, both parties finally agreed to a balanced opening price. The market price was determined by the quality of the tea, with Qimen black tea priced from 120 to 130 yuan per dan to more than 30 yuan, She tea from 90 yuan to more than 50 yuan, Tun tea from 60 yuan to 70 yuan, and Wu tea from 50 yuan to 70 yuan, all increasing by 10 to 20 yuan compared to the past. Although the cost of tea firms has increased and the mountain households have received a higher price, it only compensates for the reduction in output. However, considering the total loss of revenue in various parts of Anhui, it is estimated that the income has decreased by about two million yuan, which is an invisible but significant loss to the rural economy.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Tea Firms Decrease <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of tea firms is to try their best to reduce costs and seek to sell at a good price. In terms of reducing costs, the price of mountain tea seems to be in the hands of the tea firms, so there are often disputes over the mountain price when new tea is put on the market. As a result, the tea firms, eager to purchase tea, find it difficult to agree, and eventually the solidarity crumbles, and they rush to increase the price, until it is sold by the box. The market price is entirely controlled by foreign merchants. Therefore, in the tea trade, there is no right to buy or sell to this day. Tea merchants have long wanted to break through this difficult situation, but ultimately, due to the lack of solidarity and the environment as it is, their dreams have not been realized. The failure of the tea industry is largely due to this. This year, the attitude of tea firms, learning from years of losses, is quite calm, unlike the mutual competition of previous years. The market price has been opened in an orderly manner. Occasionally, cautious tea merchants, seeing the gloomy overseas market, purchase less tea to avoid repeating past mistakes. In total, the number of firms in various counties this year has decreased: Qimen has decreased by more than 30 firms compared to the past, Tunxi has decreased by 7, and She County and Wuyuan have each decreased by more than 20. In this extraordinary year, the purpose of tea merchants is mostly to change course according to the wind, and they are unwilling to lightly take risks in the face of the turbulent waves.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Tea Warehouses Contract <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The business of tea warehouses is similar in nature to that of brokers, except that they can first extend loans to tea firms. Tea firms that accept loans from a certain warehouse must deliver their boxed tea to that warehouse, which negotiates with foreign firms to sell it. The tea price obtained, after deducting the principal and interest of the warehouse loan and the warehouse's expenses, is used to repay the debt. If the tea firm makes tea with its own capital and sells it without losing money, the warehouse's business income will only be profitable and not loss-making. The silk and tea warehouses in various parts of Anhui are all branches of Shanghai warehouses stationed in the local area. The extension or contraction of loans must be carried out under the command of the Shanghai warehouses. In recent years, due to past losses from indiscriminate lending and the tightening of credit, various warehouses have been more cautious in extending loans. The Shanghai warehouses have also discussed regulations to restrict lending. For example, if a tea firm has not repaid its warehouse loan by the end of the year, the warehouse will report it to the trade association at the beginning of the following year, and other warehouses will not accept the firm or extend tea loans to it. After the implementation of this regulation, few tea warehouses have suffered losses. This year, the warehouses stationed in Anhui still follow the old rules and extend loans to tea firms based on whether the firm itself is sound. Each firm can borrow only 30% to 40% of its total capital. Firms with insufficient strength feel the pain of being unable to maneuver freely. Firms that speculate without capital can only sigh and dare not rashly open shop. The decrease in the number of tea firms in various places this year is indeed due to the tightening of credit.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Sales Prices are Dull <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The boxed tea from foreign firms in Anhui province is mainly sold to countries such as England, America, France, Africa, Russia, and Germany. Retail shops account for only a small proportion. The tea trade depends entirely on the smoothness, stagnation, rise, and fall of sales prices in overseas markets to determine profit or loss. In the past two years, the market prices offered by foreign merchants for Chinese tea have decreased significantly compared to the past. The selling price of Qimen black tea, due to the increase in mountain prices, is only half of the cost. The losses of tea firms in the past two years have been nearly two million yuan. The profits and losses of Wu and Tun green tea are used to make up for each other, and there is no profit. According to the report of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, the quantity of tea exported in the first quarter of this year was 72,623.67 metric tons, a decrease of more than 5,000 metric tons compared to 77,769.66 metric tons in the same quarter last year. The initial export of new green tea this year was only 85 tons. Except for a slight increase in England, all other countries have decreased, especially the United States and Russia. The Moroccan green tea market is also unusually quiet. Among them, the soil firms still have more than 8,000 boxes of Chun Mei and Zhen Mei in stock, and the road firms also have 5,000 boxes. The prices of all kinds of tea are declining. Moreover, the French colonies have implemented a double import tax on Chinese tea exported to the colonies from April 1 this year, that is, 50 yuan in Chinese silver must be levied for each dan of tea. Vietnam is also following suit and is considering increasing the import tax rate on Chinese tea. This kind of harsh tax adds another obstacle to the sale of our country's green tea in France. Last week, the first-grade Zhen Mei from Tunxi was opened in Shanghai at a new price of only 130 yuan, a decrease of 20 to 30 yuan compared to the past. The new red tea from Hekou was only opened at 65 to 66 yuan, and the price of Zhen Mei from Suian has recently fallen sharply by 20 yuan. In the future, the sales prices of Qiwu red and green tea will inevitably be difficult to improve compared to last year. Although the sale of tea this year has been changed to the new market scale, which is converted from pounds to catties, there is a slight compensation, but the amount is very small and insufficient to compensate for the discount in the price. It is unknown to what extent the future market situation will change, but based on the current sales of new tea, it is difficult to expect a turn for the better in Anhui province's tea this year.

<h3 id="e112">Gu Renfa's False Accusation Case: Li Shuyun and Her Mother Are Innocent. The Re-Marriage Case Was Heard Yesterday, But Gu Still Failed to Appear After Being Summoned. <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>(Wuxi News) The case of Gu Renfa, former Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, being accused by Li Shuyun of re-marriage and false accusation has been twice summoned by the local branch court of this county for investigation. Gu has refused to appear. Yesterday (2nd) was another court date for this case. A summons was issued to Gu Renfa, Li Shuyun, and Li Liu before the hearing, but Gu Renfa still failed to appear. Only Li Shuyun and her mother appeared as summoned. At 3:30 PM, Prosecutor Qian of the first instance began the hearing in the investigation court. Li Shuyun and her mother requested that Gu Renfa be arrested and severely punished. If he could not be arrested, they requested an order for his wanted status. The judge approved the request and instructed them to submit a written request for arrest. The court was then adjourned. Regarding the parts of Gu Renfa's false accusation against Li Shuyun and Li Liu of instigating Liu Zhuomin to resist transfer, obstructing official duties, and selling official positions for fraud, the Chief Prosecutor Qian has now completed the investigation and believes that the Li Shuyun and her mother do not have sufficient criminal suspicion. Yesterday, he had already issued a decision not to prosecute. Now, the original text of the decision not to prosecute has been obtained and copied as follows: "Defendant Gu Li Shuyun, 22 years old, from Changsha, Hunan; Li Liu, 50 years old, from Changsha, Hunan; The aforementioned case of instigating obstruction of official duties and fraud, Case No. 776 of the General Letter of 1934, has been fully investigated in accordance with the law. This office believes that a decision not to prosecute should be made. The facts and reasons are now stated below: Gu Li Shuyun is the daughter of Li Liu and the wife of Gu Renfa, the former Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department. After Gu Renfa became the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, he resided at No. 1 Taigu Mountain, Zhenjiang. Li Liu temporarily stayed at Gu's home to take care of her daughter's illness. On March 12 of this year, Liu Zhuomin, Director of the Second Branch of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, was dismissed from his post. Coincidentally, Li Shuyun and her mother, Li Liu, went to Shanghai for medical treatment on the 13th. At the same time, Liu Zhuomin was sent for investigation for obstructing official duties because he hid the seal and refused to hand it over, and his wife, Liu Wen, scolded public officials. Not long after, it was reported that Gu Li Shuyun and Li Liu were suspected of instigating Liu Zhuomin to resist handing over the official seal and were engaged in swindling and deception. In addition, the Wuxi County Government received a telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating that Li Shuyun and her mother had been arrested by the Civil Affairs Department in Shanghai and were currently detained by the Second Special District Court. It ordered the county to transfer the case to this office for investigation. After repeated inquiries, the defendants Gu Li Shuyun and Li Liu consistently denied instigating Liu Zhuomin to resist handing over the official seal and denied engaging in swindling and deception. The accuser, Gu Renfa, has also repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned. In addition, the Civil Affairs Department has sent various volumes of evidence of Li Shuyun's swindling and deception. After reviewing the volumes of evidence, it is impossible to prove that the defendants committed any crimes. Except for Liu Zhuomin and Liu Wen's obstruction of official duties, which is a separate case, the reasons for the lack of evidence in this case are divided into two points and stated below: (1) The part of instigating obstruction of official duties: To instigate a crime, the criminal act of the person being instigated must be purely the result of the instigator's actions in order to be established. Liu Zhuomin's concealment of the seal was not only denied by Gu Li Shuyun and Li Liu, but Liu Zhuomin also stated in court that he was not instructed by Gu Li Shuyun, etc. It is clear that Liu Zhuomin's obstruction of official duties is unrelated to Gu Li Shuyun. As for the statement that Gu Li Shuyun came to Wuxi on March 13 and met with Liu Zhuomin at the New World Hotel, it was found that Room 60 of the hotel's circulation book was rented by Li Shuyun on that day. It is still questionable whether it was a pseudonym used by Gu Li Shuyun. Even if it is true, it is difficult to use the fact that they met as conclusive evidence of instigating obstruction of official duties. (2) Part of fraud: The original evidence sent was nothing more than the reports of Zeng Fanhong and Hao Ruyuan, and the letters of Zhou Zhengyuan, etc. However, when Zeng Fanhong was questioned in court, he said that when he met Li Fengqi, he asked who was in charge of the Civil Affairs Department that day, what kind of losses Li Fengqi had suffered, and what the amount of the losses was. All of these answers were evasive and could not be answered accurately. Gu Li Shuyun claimed that there was no such person as Li Fengqi in her mother's family, which is sufficient to show that Zeng Fanhong's report is obviously not credible. As for Hao Ruyuan's statement that Li Shuyun called from Nanjing and asked Secretary Wan to maintain Liu Zhuomin's position, it is purely one-sided and difficult to believe. Even if the request was true, it cannot be hastily regarded as fraud. As for Zhou Zhengyuan and others claiming that Li Shuyun sought bribes and sold official positions for money, repeated investigations have yielded no conclusive evidence. In addition, the original evidence sent stated that Gu Shuyun demanded a large sum of money, which was based on the original letter from Huang Jiazhun and the receipt from Gu Li Shuyun. However, according to Li Shuyun's statement, she went to Shanghai for medical treatment on March 13 and stayed at Huang Yiou's house in Xinmin Village. Because of medical expenses, she sent a letter to Gu Renfa asking him to send money and wrote a letter to Secretary Wan Zongzhou. Later, Secretary Wan's surname Huang sent 200 yuan, which was delivered in two installments. The receipts were also given in two installments. There was no borrowing of money from Huang Jiazhun to purchase furniture, etc. When questioned, Huang Jiazhun stated that the 200 yuan was borrowed by Gu Li Shuyun to purchase furniture, etc. However, the receipt presented by Huang Jiazhun had Gu Li Shuyun's business card for the first time and plain paper for the second time, with the words 'Da An came from abroad' and 'Da An sent abroad' on it. Da An is the number of Gu Renfa. It is certain that the money was sent by Gu Renfa when it was delivered, and there is no doubt that it was not borrowed from Huang Jiazhun. Otherwise, Huang Jiazhun would not have accepted this receipt at that time. It is clear that Huang Jiazhun can only be said to have been responsible for the delivery of the money. How can it be forcibly associated with Li Shuyun borrowing and demanding money? As for Li Liu, she only accompanied her daughter Li Shuyun to Shanghai for medical treatment. The facts are very obvious. Even Huang Jiazhun's statement in court did not involve Li Liu at all. Even more so, Li Liu has no crime to speak of. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 244, Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Criminal Law, a decision not to prosecute is made. Qian Chengyun, Chief Prosecutor of the Wuxi Branch of the Jiangsu Wu County Local Court, May 22, 1934."</p>

<p>Xia Ajin, who runs a duck shop in Zhuganhui, has been frugal and has saved a little money, so he has been coveted by bandits. On the 29th of last month, he suddenly received a threatening letter signed by Wang Debiao, which stated that he was short of military pay and that his army protected them, so he needed to borrow 500 yuan. If he refused to borrow, he would send someone to kidnap his nursing son. He was given a deadline to meet at Songhui Xiaozhu. After receiving the letter, Xia did not dare to make a public announcement, but was strictly on guard. Unexpectedly, the previous night, he heard footsteps on the roof. He turned on the light and saw a black foreign-breed pug dog. He drove it away and it jumped down. Because the dog was different from wild dogs, someone must have raised it. How could it climb on the roof? It was obviously related to the threatening letter. He immediately reported the dog and the threatening letter to the Second Branch Police Station, which transferred them to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation. The dog was initially detained in the bureau, and the trail was to be investigated, but accidentally, the dog escaped. It is now being investigated and pursued.</p>

<p>Chen, the third concubine of Shang Jiaren, the former chairman of the county chamber of commerce, committed suicide by poisoning and at the same time poisoned her two young daughters. She was rescued but did not die. The county government has summoned her three times. Chen did not arrive for the first two summons because she was in Shanghai. At the third court hearing, Chen stated that Gao falsely accused her of having an affair with Qian Xiaofeng, a gatekeeper, and forced her to take poison. She did not know how her two daughters died. Gao admitted to smoking opium and stated that Chen took poison herself and poisoned her two daughters. After reviewing the confession, Judge Shao ruled that Gao and Chen were responsible for the deaths and sentenced them to five years of imprisonment. Gao Jiaren was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for causing death through negligence and fined 300 yuan for smoking opium.</p>

<p>Chen Ajin, from Changshu Renyang, went to Xu Jingzhai's house in Shuangfeng Town the day before yesterday to collect society fees. While passing through the Fourth Ward of the Sixteenth District of the Eighth District of the county, he was beaten to death by his enemy Yang A'gen and his accomplices Yang Fuxian, Gu A'gen, etc., and his body was thrown into the river. After the incident, Yang, etc. bribed the ward chief with a large sum of money. The ward chief received 70 yuan in bribes and falsely reported the death on the road to the county government. The land inspector also took bribes and went to the countryside to inspect the body. The deceased's family, Chen Shaoyun, etc., feeling aggrieved, reported the incident to the County Public Security Bureau and requested a fair investigation. After the County Bureau received the report, it sent a detective team leader to investigate and found that the report was true. Over the past few days, detectives have been secretly dispatched to arrest the principal offender, Yang A'gen, etc. Yesterday afternoon, a preliminary trial was held. Ward Chief Zhu Ting confessed that the case was handled by Zhao Yangyue, the current commander of the Eighth District Security Regiment, and Zhao Jingyuan, the outgoing district chief. Wang Bao, a patrol officer of the Public Security Bureau, received a bribe of 30 yuan, which was paid by Zhu. The County Bureau, considering that the case involved human life and was complex, sent the witnesses' statements and confessions to the county for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Garment workers in Suzhou City launched a strike against the Garment Industry Association organized by Chen Yulin, etc. Yesterday (2nd) was the second day. At about 8 a.m., hundreds of workers gathered at the Xuanyuan Public Office in Jiusheng Lane to discuss solutions, but their opinions were divided. The main purpose was to demand the abolition of the Garment Industry Association organized by Chen Yulin, etc., who are not in the industry. In the afternoon, the crowd planned to go to the Public Security Bureau to petition. Director Shen of the Public Security Bureau, fearing that the workers would riot, specially dispatched more police to patrol the Guanqian Street area to maintain law and order. Chen Yulin, the chairman of the Garment Industry Association, who was arrested on the evening of the day before yesterday, is still detained in the Public Security Bureau. After the county government received the Public Security Bureau's report on the strike situation, it has submitted it to the province for review.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Wuxi: Cocoon Industry Control Case Resolved <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Since the province promulgated the Cocoon Industry Control Regulations, the cocoon industry in this county has unanimously opposed it. There has been a dispute between the government and merchants. Recently, the Cocoon Industry Association of this county has made three requests, asking the authorities to allow flexibility. This was submitted to County Magistrate and Model Sericulture Zone Director Yan Shenyu and Deputy Director Cai Jingde for instructions from the province. The situation has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that Yan and Cai returned to Wuxi from the province yesterday. In accordance with the control measures, the spring cocoons of this session are in a hurry, and the procedures may be insufficient. Therefore, special flexibility will be given to the three requests made by the cocoon industry. The request of the first article is approved to open for business, but only for this session. After this, the precedent shall not be cited for handling. The second article, the association voluntarily gives up handling registration procedures and baking worker profits, which is not impossible, but the association shall still be responsible for guaranteeing the guarantee deposit. The third article, the cocoon merchants have already complied with the payment, and the association shall still be responsible for persuading them. Yesterday, a special letter was sent to the Cocoon Industry Association for reference. As of yesterday, there were already 86 cocoon firms reported to be opened in the county. Yesterday, the Model Sericulture Zone of this county also sent personnel to various villages to investigate the cocoon firms.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Security at the Venue <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The traffic, security, sanitation, and layout inside and outside the venue of the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Welcome Panchen Lama General Assembly were all completed yesterday. From Guohuo Road to the City Government Gate, the venue of the General Assembly, the Public Security Bureau has specially added command post police at various intersections. The area around the front road of the government, the rear road of the government, and the left road in front of the government are guarded by soldiers from the Security Committee of the Security Department. Inside the venue, order is maintained by Boy Scouts, Public Security Bureau police officers, and soldiers from the Garrison Command.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Layout Situation <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>In the center of the General Assembly venue, a stage was built with a yellow cloth banner hanging horizontally, with the words "Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Welcome Panchen Lama General Assembly" written on it. In the center, a portrait of the Premier and the party and national flags were hung. Party and national flags were also hung in front of the city government gate.

<p>The Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Municipal Welcome Panchen Lama General Assembly, fearing that there would be too many participants today and that the existing vehicles would be insufficient for distribution, consulted with the Municipal Public Utility Bureau and requested that the Songhu Branch of the Two Roads Administration, the Fourth Road Public Bus of the Zhabei Public Bus, and the Second Road and Fourth Road trams of the China Merchants Electric Company all add vehicles. Temporary public buses were also added between Jiangwan Railway Station and the City Government to transport pedestrians. In order to give preferential treatment to customers, the Two Roads Administration offered a half-price fare for groups of 50 or more people introduced by the Municipal Public Utility Bureau. The public buses and trams will still charge the original price.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Welcome Declaration <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The National Defense Forum of this port published a welcome declaration to the Panchen Lama, saying that the Panchen Lama personally inscribed the Morning Post on May 26, "Support the Three Principles of the People and Promote World Peace." Reading it, it is infinitely moving. The ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People is to pray for world harmony. The way to achieve this is to have all ethnic groups in the country be equal and strive for the liberation of the entire nation and the freedom of the entire country from international imperialism. Then, we should support weak and small nations and gather in the ranks of freedom and equality so that people of all colors, both colored and colorless, can coexist and prosper, reaching a state of great harmony. Therefore, the Three Principles of the People have a close relationship with world peace. To promote world peace, one must support the Three Principles of the People. Since the Panchen Lama understands this meaning, then this return to Tibet to preside over government affairs will be able to follow the central government's intentions, take all measures, internally appease the Tibetan people, and externally respond to the international situation. He will be able to manage the situation with ease and consolidate the border. At this time, the international situation is gradually becoming treacherous. If the domestic compatriots can cut off the worries of the western frontier and focus on national defense construction, so as to help the struggle for survival in the future, then the excitement of their hearts will be limitless. And the Panchen Lama does not refuse the labor of trekking long distances, and comes to Shanghai from afar, and clearly shows us that he will take this mission to Tibet, then we should take this extremely rare opportunity to express our warmth and welcome, and cheer slogans, "Long live the Five Ethnic Groups Republicanism," "Long live the Chinese Kuomintang," "Long live the Chinese Nation," "Long live the Republic of China!"</p>
<h3 id="e125">Visiting the War Zone <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Panchen Lama, accompanied by a staff member of the city government, went to Wusong to visit the fort war zone at 10 a.m. yesterday. In advance, Yao Guangnai, the chief of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau, and Yao Benyuan, the director of the office, deployed patrols along the Outer Bund to protect him. After arriving in Song, the Panchen and his entourage went to the fort to pay tribute to the war zone, led by Jin Zhigao, the management committee member, to visit the north and south forts and see the war results. Then, they went to the Fuzhi Hotel for a meal, where they were welcomed by Wu Song's leaders Yao Guangnai, Tang Chengzong, Yao Benyuan, Wang Chenge, Wu Ren, Qiyin Gongtian, Gu Danchao, Xu Yan, Cheng Kuanzheng, and Yan Songbin. During the banquet, after Tang Chengzong of the Municipal Committee gave a speech, the Panchen stood up to answer, saying that during the Shanghai Incident two years ago, he was in Mongolia. When the news came, he felt particularly sad. Now, visiting the fort war zone, the scenes are still vivid in his mind. It can be seen that the artillery fire was fierce at that time, and the people's suffering was even more unspeakable. Now, the market in your area has been able to restore its former appearance in the midst of great difficulties, which shows that the efforts of all of you in local construction are admirable. He is a Buddhist believer and has no power to help. He can only pray for your health in secret. After taking a photo at around 12 o'clock, he shook hands with the welcomers and returned to Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Navigation Association sent a letter yesterday to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating: "Regarding your letter No. 5033 from the General Department, we have received a letter from our representative to the Municipal Pilotage Management Committee, Mr. Chen Tianjun, reporting on the committee's affairs. According to reports, the Customs is strongly advocating amending the regulations, unwilling to have this committee exist, and plans to abolish the Chamber of Commerce committee seat. Furthermore, the representative of the Ministry of Finance has proposed increasing the pilotage fee rate by one time the original rate, and a letter has been prepared stating that the original rate should be temporarily collected. A copy of the original letter is enclosed for your review.</p>
<p>This association has submitted it to the Executive Committee for discussion and decided that the Pilotage Management Committee must exist and the Chamber of Commerce representative committee seat cannot be abolished. The Yangtze River pilotage fee rate is already very high; if it is increased again, it will be unbearable. The association has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting that it fight for this matter reasonably. Accordingly, we are replying to respectfully request that your esteemed chamber make clear representations to the relevant departments and reasonably fight for this matter to protect sovereignty and maintain the shipping industry. We would be deeply grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Anti-Opium Society's June 3rd Commemoration Declaration <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>"The Chinese Anti-Opium Society, taking today as the 95th anniversary of Lin Zexu's burning of opium at Humen, and at a time when our country's New Life Movement is experiencing a surge from lax to strict opium prohibition, urgently calls upon the people to devote themselves to the anti-opium movement. A commemorative ceremony was held today, and important statements will be made regarding the opium prohibition stance and the future of anti-opium efforts. The declaration of the society is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>The commemoration of Lin Gong's burning of opium has continued year after year, and the opium scourge has become increasingly rampant. Internal and external troubles have followed, which is truly heartbreaking. Recently, the domestic anti-opium atmosphere has intensified through the advocacy of anti-opium comrades from various quarters. Opium dens in Wuhan were closed first, and Chairman Chiang's decree banning drugs was promulgated later. Anhui, Fujian, and other southeastern provinces have all cleared opium seedlings, which is somewhat satisfactory. However, the transport of raw opium on the Yangtze River has not stopped, and the opium prohibition in various provinces still lacks a definite stance. Inland warlords still rely on opium taxes to maintain their military supplies. The Ping-Liao railway construction request is actually aimed at facilitating the transport of raw opium into the interior. While North China has not yet been lost, Japanese and Korean rogues have intensified their conspiracy to spread drugs, causing fundamental destruction. Recently, Chairman Soong toured the Northwest and deeply felt the ferocity of the opium scourge. Looking around the country, apart from Shandong and Zhejiang, where the results of opium prohibition are somewhat remarkable, there is nothing to say in other provinces. Now that Chairman Chiang has issued strict orders, he will definitely implement his stance. Vice Commander Zhang has returned from studying abroad and also strongly advocates opium prohibition. The legislative and supervisory authorities have protested the opium ban repeatedly, which shows that the authorities are all aware of this, and it is very gratifying. Indeed, in today's situation in our country, we cannot save the nation without resisting Japan, and we cannot survive without banning opium, and banning opium is a prerequisite for resisting Japan. The people's physical strength is weak, their spirits are depressed, and the sick man has even become an opium addict. How can we resist strong enemies and defend the country? Moreover, the New Life Movement is being promoted everywhere, and all levels of society are studying the ancient precepts of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and forging new rules of strength, health, and cleanliness. Opium and all narcotics are the chief of all poisons and the source of all filth. Those who indulge in them become withered in body and degenerate in morality. The most humble, weak, and shameless creatures in the world are indeed opium addicts. In recent times, the corruption of officialdom has been lamented as a sign of national demise. Although the reasons vary, the most powerful factors at play are the collection of opium taxes and the trade in narcotics. Therefore, if the drug scourge is not eradicated, the official system cannot be rectified. Which patriotic and sensible person does not sympathize with this statement? Lin Wenzhong Gong said, "If opium is not banned, in ten years, not only will there be no funds to raise, but there will also be no soldiers to use." How painful and accurate are these words! Alas, whose fault is it that China has fallen into ruin? We have nurtured sores and brought about calamity, taking the blame upon ourselves. This society has been fighting against opium for ten years, and what we have seen is clearer, and what we have said is more painful. Previously, we called opium the vanguard of the strong neighbors' aggression, the source of political evil, the source of famine and bandits, and the main cause of the people's distress. Those who did not know thought we were deliberately making alarming statements to sensationalize the public, but now they have all unfortunately been verified. On this day of serious national crisis, we must rise up together and eradicate the source of the disease. This society, upholding the legacy of the Premier and entrusted by the people, will adhere to its past stance and strive to the end. We hereby declare."</p>

<p>Attorney Yao Yongli, representing the chairman, reported on the preparatory work, saying that since the establishment of this company, Mr. Kong Yongzhi, Mr. Song Ziwen, Mr. Xie Zuokai, Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, Mr. Li Shizeng, and other leaders of the national financial and economic circles have seen the stagnation of domestic industry, commerce, and various enterprises and are urgently seeking ways to remedy the situation.

Therefore, at the end of last year, they initiated the organization of this company. It was not until April 18 that the share-raising articles of association and other documents were submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs for record and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. On April 24, the Bureau of Social Affairs issued an order approving the record. On May 28, the Ministry of Finance issued an order approving the approval. It has been found that the company's authorized capital is 10 million yuan, all of which has been raised by the Chinese people and has now been fully paid up and deposited in various domestic banks. According to the law, a founding general meeting should be convened immediately. Therefore, at noon on May 31, a meeting of initiators was convened at the temporary office of the company on the sixth floor of the Continental Bank on Jiujiang Road, and the Bureau of Social Affairs was requested to send personnel to attend the founding meeting for supervision. The above is the preparatory work of this company. Please ask the shareholders to discuss the articles of association one by one, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Exceptional Interpretation of Trademark Law; Machine Industry Association Requests Supplementation <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Machinery-Made Domestic Goods Factories in this city sent a letter to Jiao Yitang, Chairman of the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee, and all members yesterday regarding the Trademark Law, stating: "Respectfully, this association previously submitted a document to the Legislative Yuan on April 16 of this year, stating that the interpretation of the Trademark Law is exceptional and hinders national confidence, and requesting that a proposal be made to supplement it. According to Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law, the words, graphics, and symbols are originally three types. If the words do not contain sound and meaning, they are no different from graphics and symbols. Why must words be the prerequisite? This shows that words must contain sound and meaning. The difference between a person who can read and a person who cannot read lies in whether or not they can pronounce the word. If a deaf person wants to test whether they know this word or not, they must write another word with the same sound to show to others. This is a matter of course. However, when people who cannot read buy and sell goods, it depends entirely on what they hear and say. If trademarks with different words but the same sound are allowed to be registered, wouldn't this</p>
<h3 id="e137">Encourage Confusion? <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, this is not allowed by the Trademark Bureau's usual practice. However, since the Executive Yuan requested the Judicial Yuan to interpret it, it has been said that words do not contain sound and meaning and are treated as graphics and symbols in general, which will allow tricksters to compete to use trademarks with different words but the same sound to deceive the public, affect the future of industry and commerce, and overturn the precedents of the Trademark Law. The dignity of trademark registration has fundamentally disappeared. Whether internal or external, it is enough to hinder national confidence. The only way to do this now is to request your esteemed Yuan to supplement Articles 1 and 2 of the Trademark Law in the spirit of legislation, so as to reassure people and prevent the trend of trickery. Judging from the original meaning of Article 1, Paragraph 2, it is very broad and does not necessarily need to specify that words include sound and meaning. Because no one else has registered before, there is no such thing as similarity. Therefore, its crackdown is listed in the various clauses of Article, which is very appropriate in the original intention of legislation. However, regarding "designated colors," it is proposed to add a "得" (dé, can) character under the "并" (bìng, and) character, because according to the original regulations, only one color is clearly used, or there is no color at all, such as those used on glass bottles and iron boxes. However, those who imitate can argue by taking different colors. If the original registrant has to prevent its drawbacks, first register all the similar trademarks of various colors one by one. The Trademark Bureau can get a large income, but the industrial and commercial households cannot afford it, and it is</p>
<h3 id="e138">Impossible to Prevent <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, if a "得" (dé, can) character is added, those that are not necessary but similar are already in the list of natural crackdowns. This is the request for Article 1, Paragraph 2. After listing the various clauses in Article 2, it is proposed to add a clause saying, "The similarity or approximation mentioned in the preceding paragraph includes the shape, color, sound, and meaning of words, graphics, and symbols. All those who have the suspicion of suggestion are included in it." Because the Trademark Law has no clear regulations on the definition of similarity, it is a major shortcoming. As a result, the same case has different results and contradicts each other, making people at a loss. Now that it has been clearly stipulated, it is enough to prevent trickery and avoid various disputes. For this reason, I am submitting this document to your esteemed Yuan for consideration, so as to contribute a fool's opinion. I am looking forward to it very much. After the presentation was made, on May 21, a letter was received from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, which opened, "A document was issued by the President of the Yuan, 'The interpretation of the Trademark Law is exceptional,</p>
<h3 id="e139">Hindering National Confidence, <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Please supplement Articles 1 and 2 of the law and consider it.' It was approved to be handed over to the Commercial Law Committee for record." In addition to handing it over as directed, I am corresponding to inform you that I have seen the intention of your esteemed Yuan to care for the people's concerns and sympathize with the difficulties of businesses. Not only are the 286 member factories of our association leading and hoping, but all those who read the newspaper are like seeing clouds and rain. However, for the past month, there has been no impact, and counterfeit and suggestive trademarks have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain and flooded the market. Since they cannot be brought to justice, how can the hearts of good people be comforted? For this reason, I venture to submit this official letter, requesting that your seat take the spirit of legislation as the basis and quickly check the original submission, propose a supplement, so as to prevent tricksters from taking advantage of the loopholes and exempt those who always worry about their business. The matter is related to trademark credibility, which is observed by Chinese and foreign people. I hope that you will find a way to remedy it and ensure national credibility. It is a great blessing. Sincerely submitted to the Chairman and Members of the Legal System Committee of the Legislative Yuan, The Joint Association of Machinery-Made Domestic Goods Factories."</p>

<p>President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Zhesheng, had previously gone to Beijing to attend the Central Political Conference and handle the affairs of the Legislative Yuan. Now that he has completed his work, he took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Shanghai with Legislative Yuan member Ma Chaojun and Acting Minister of Industry Liu Weizhi the night before. They arrived here at around 7 o'clock yesterday morning. After arriving in Shanghai, Sun went out at around 9 o'clock and did not return to his residence until 11:30 to rest. Therefore, the reporters who visited yesterday morning did not get to meet him.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Provisional General Meeting of the Shipping Guild Discusses the Detention of the Jing'an Vessel; Resolution to Petition for the Establishment of a Provisional Arbitration Tribunal for Special Adjudication <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Guild, regarding the detention of the Sanbei Company's Jing'an steamship, convened a provisional general membership meeting on the afternoon of May 31st, following a resolution by the executive committee. Fifty members attended. Chairman Yuan Lvdeng reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the provisional general membership meeting was convened based on the executive committee's resolution due to the wrongful detention of the Sanbei Company's Jing'an steamship. Of the eighty members of the guild, fifty members and representatives were present, constituting a quorum. The meeting should commence immediately, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing of the Sanbei Company was requested to report on the details of the case.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing reported that in January of this year, a Fuzhou small steamship sank off Longju Sandbar. The shipowner, Yu Shicheng, falsely accused the Sanbei Company's Jing'an steamship of causing the sinking and filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court. The court, based on a one-sided accusation, and without conducting an inspection, hastily issued a letter to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, which forwarded the letter to detain the ship. The Customs Superintendent, without investigating the circumstances, followed the court's letter and detained the ship. Subsequently, they were ordered to provide a guarantee of 80,000 yuan before the ship could be released. The detention has lasted nearly fifty days.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the Zhenjiang authorities verified the Jing'an steamship's logbook, proving the time of arrival in Zhenjiang. Furthermore, the Shanghai Maritime Administration's Ship Collision Dispute Resolution Committee conducted an investigation and determined that the sinking was not caused by the Jing'an steamship. The plaintiff initially claimed that the red paint under the anchor chain hole on the starboard side of the Jing'an steamship was scraped, indicating a collision. However, the paint under the anchor chain hole of a steamship is easily damaged due to friction from the frequent raising and lowering of the anchor. This point was determined by the Ship Collision Dispute Resolution Committee as not being evidence of a collision. The plaintiff then claimed that the dents on the ship's hull were evidence of a collision. However, the dents on the Jing'an steamship's hull were seven feet below the waterline. The ship was carrying 1,500 tons of cargo on that day, with a draft of fourteen feet, making it highly unlikely that the dents were caused by a collision.</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Navy, regarding the detention of the Jing'an, requested the Ministry of Justice to order its release, stating that ship collisions are common occurrences. In the event of an accident, the port authorities should investigate witnesses and examine documentary and physical evidence upon arrival at the port for use in litigation. There is no precedent for indefinitely detaining a seagoing vessel involved in transportation and commerce. Moreover, the owner of the Jing'an, the Shanghai Sanbei Company, is subject to litigation. If a judgment is made requiring compensation, the company would naturally bear that responsibility. Maritime regulations regarding liability pertain to the owner, which is the common practice in all countries. While the litigation procedures of our courts do not necessarily have to be the same as those of other countries, the method of enforcement should not be uniquely different. Maritime transportation is related to maritime affairs, and at a time when international shipping routes are developing, international practices should be taken into consideration. Courts cannot detain ships in cases of ship collisions, and the explanation is very clear.</p>
<p>However, the Shanghai District Court disregarded everything and prolonged the detention, demanding a guarantee. If this precedent is set, the future of the shipping industry is unimaginable. Moreover, at a time when the nation is united in advocating for the recovery of shipping rights and the abolition of extraterritoriality, the impact is even greater. Although the Sanbei Company can勉力 manage to raise 80,000 yuan in cash with great difficulty, other smaller companies would face losses of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan after a month of detention and would be required to provide a guarantee of 80,000 yuan. Regardless of the outcome of the litigation, the company would already be bankrupt. Therefore, for the sake of the shipping industry's future, even if there is sufficient cash to provide a guarantee, it is inappropriate to rashly set this precedent and become the罪人 of the shipping industry. Although the detention of the Jing'an is a sacrifice for the Sanbei Company alone, it is of great importance to the future of all shipping merchants. I sincerely present a detailed report of the case and hope that the company will discuss relief measures to rectify the injustice. The Sanbei Company will be grateful, and the industry will be fortunate.</p>
<p>The meeting resolved to send telegrams to the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of the Navy, requesting that a provisional arbitration tribunal be specially established to adjudicate the case fairly and provide relief before a maritime arbitration organization is established. Regarding the Ministry of Transportation's formulation of a table of the number of crew members on ships and the deadline for crew certification, the resolution was to send a telegram to the Ministry of Transportation to examine the actual difficulties. For coastal and river ships, if it is temporarily impossible to replace all crew members with those holding appropriate certificates, crew members holding lower-level certificates should be temporarily allowed to act as substitutes to avoid suspension of navigation.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Member Wang Bolao proposed to discuss the shipping cooperation plan. Member Yang Guanbei seconded the proposal. After the chairman consulted the opinions of the members, they unanimously approved it. Secretary-General Chen was designated to report on the process. Chairman Chen then requested a public discussion. Committee Member Chen Ganqing suggested that shipping cooperation is an essential plan to save ourselves from danger and should be actively promoted to achieve realization. However, it is crucial to clarify whether each company agrees to cooperate in order to facilitate statistics. A letter should be sent to each member asking whether they agree to effective cooperation, and a reply should be requested within two weeks of receiving the letter. It would be even more desirable if the cooperation methods could be disclosed together. The resolution was passed according to the original proposal.</p>

<p>According to Da Gong She, the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, in order to promote the sound organization of women's groups in various provinces and cities, sent a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday to investigate and handle the matter. The original telegram stated, "The outline for the organization of women's associations and its implementing rules, as stipulated by this committee, have been promulgated for a long time. However, although many provincial and municipal party headquarters have organized or reorganized women's associations in their respective regions according to law, there are still many that have not been organized or have been organized but are unsound. If this continues, it will have a significant impact on the future of the women's movement. It is hereby notified that you should investigate and handle the matter, promptly guide the organization according to the outline for the organization of women's associations and its implementing rules. Those that have already been organized should be guided to make them sound. Chen Gongbo, Director of the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, Wang Luyi, Deputy Director."</p>
<h3 id="e147">Kong Xiangrong Discusses the Closure Project: The Function of Building Water Sluice Dams <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangrong, director of the work relief group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, discussed the impeachment by Supervisory Commissioner Shao Hongji, saying that the three impeachments by Supervisory Commissioner Shao were for Kong's proposition of building a closed-air dam with water sluice dams at the kiln head. This matter has been brewing for a long time. Previously, it was heard that the third impeachment had been reviewed and rejected. Now, seeing the newspaper report that it has been passed and handed over to the Disciplinary Committee, the reason for its passage is not understood.</p>
<p>The method used by the previous administration to close the breach at Fenglou was a water-permeable stone dam. Although Rong quickly completed the closing of the breach in a very short time, the flow continued due to water permeability. Adding a water sluice dam behind the stone dam has three advantages: (1) It can consolidate the front stone dam and gain water resistance; (2) It can cut off the flow after the dam is closed, preventing the newly built embankment at Shitou Village from becoming dangerous; and (3) It can prevent the people of dozens of villages between the stone dam and Shitou Village from being flooded again.</p>
<p>Since the water level rose in late April, the stone dam has remained permeable, so the water level in front of the kiln head water dam has increased. Because the water dam has been closed, the water level behind the dam is lower, with a difference of more than seven市尺 between the front and back. This is clear evidence that the stone dam is permeable and the water dam cuts off the flow. Without this water dam as a barrier, the top of the new embankment at Shitou Village would be level with the water, posing a dangerous threat. Moreover, the project to raise and thicken the new embankment cannot obtain soil from the river.</p>
<p>The nature of the Yellow River is changeable. Those in charge believe that no work needs to be done when the water is low, but they are panicked and do not know how to defend when the water rises. This is because the nature of the river is different, the responsibilities are different, so the vision is different, and the propositions are also different. Because he is unwilling to agree with others, there have been these three impeachments. However, this dam project has been approved and filed, and Chairman Li of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has certified that it is a foolproof plan. The three financial directors of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, dispatched by the committee, and Zhang, committee member and secretary-general of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, inspected the results and believed that it was necessary to build this water dam. After submitting the report to the committee, they received a telegram ordering them to rush to build it and immediately close it. Various local groups along the river visited the construction site and submitted a petition requesting special protection for the water dam to ensure its permanent protection. The committee has telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government, which has replied that it has ordered the River Affairs Bureau to comply. The effectiveness of this dam is very obvious, and it is clear that it is not a waste of public funds. If the impeachment is established, all important letters and telegrams will be reviewed and reported again.</p>
<p>However, this water dam has been effective at low water levels and will be even more effective during the peak flood season. To carry out construction work in this changeable Yellow River, preparations with a longer-term vision are necessary to achieve temporary defense effects. How dare we not be careful? Rong only seeks to fulfill his duties and does not care about other things.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Zhenru District New Life Movement Propaganda Meeting <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Zhenru District New Life Movement Preparatory Committee held a propaganda meeting at the Sixth Simple Sports Field. Over 2,000 people from various groups and the public attended. After performing the礼行, Chairman Chen Zhongfu reported, saying that the New Life Movement is not a profound theory. It is to teach people how to be human, the purpose and goals, and the methods to implement it. All human behaviors and thoughts that adopt the New Life Movement are the best people in the world. He then explained the four words of礼义　耻 in detail and hoped that we must at least achieve the two points of neatness and cleanliness. Subsequently, Committee Member Hong, Section Chief Zhou, Xu Yizhou, Song Erte, and Yang Zhulai gave speeches on stage, full of warnings. After the speeches, the New Life Movement song was sung, and the New Life Covenant was distributed before the meeting was adjourned. It was also heard that there would be a grand提 meeting that evening.</p>
<h3 id="e149">New Drug Industry Requests Separate Regulations for Selling Medical Anesthetics; Requests the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Forward a Letter to Chairman Chiang <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The New Drug Guild requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward a letter to Chairman Chiang, stating, "To request the promulgation of separate regulations for the sale of medical anesthetics in order to facilitate medical treatment and prevent abuses. It is well known that drugs such as morphine, cocaine, and heroin are potent and toxic to society. Chairman Chiang is concerned about this and resolutely promulgated the Strict Prohibition of Potent Narcotics Regulations, with the transport and sale of these drugs punishable by death. This demonstrates the spirit of diligent governance and stopping killing with killing, which moves all people with blood and spirit. However, while the abuse of these toxic drugs is more than enough to destroy the nation and exterminate the race, they are indispensable in modern medical treatment. Western countries have regulations for the sale of these drugs. Even the Chinese Pharmacopoeia promulgated by the former Ministry of Health has detailed records of the properties, uses, and dosages of these toxic drugs, and there are special regulations for their application by licensed physicians and pharmacists. This is because these drugs are essential for treatment and should not be abandoned because of fear of choking. Since the Qing Dynasty strictly prohibited opium, these toxic drugs have also been strictly prohibited at the same time. At that time, modern medicine had not yet emerged, so there was not much hindrance to scientific application. In recent decades, modern medicine has become more and more common, and hospitals and medical schools have been established one after another. The scientific application of these toxic drugs has also become more and more widespread.</p>
<p>We, as merchants engaged in the sale of medical drugs, and various health agencies and licensed physicians, cannot avoid needing these toxic drugs. Refusing them is not allowed by the facts, and complying with them is suspected of violating the law. In desperation, we can only rely on the signature of a licensed physician and then request foreign merchants to supply them. This has become a customary practice but is not in accordance with the law. Although the Ordinance on the Management of Narcotics was promulgated by the municipal government on September 11, 1929, and amended by the municipal government on November 7, 1931, Article 3 states that the import and distribution of narcotics shall be the responsibility of the general management agency designated by the Ministry of the Interior. Later, the Department of Health approved on September 7, 1932, that the Nanjing Central Hospital had been approved by the Executive Yuan to handle this general management agency. After several years, the general management agency has not been established. Therefore, although the Ordinance on the Management of Narcotics has been promulgated, it has not been implemented fundamentally. We have repeatedly asked Director Liu to formulate measures as soon as possible, but there has been no result. We merchants have the intention to abide by the law but have no basis for it and are in a state of embarrassment.</p>
<p>Now, Chairman Chiang deeply hates the poison of addiction and is saving the lives of the people. Strict laws and harsh penalties are rectifying the source. We merchants are all citizens and cannot but be inspired to abide by the law and live up to his expectations. However, the Ordinance on the Management of Narcotics promulgated by the National Government is difficult to implement, and Chairman Chiang has not had time to stipulate the difference between medical use and abuse. Although Article 14 states that matters not provided for in this ordinance shall be governed by other laws, there is actually no basis in fact. We merchants are concerned about our business and cannot avoid the suffering of being caught in a trap. After repeated deliberations, we all believe that legitimate pharmacies should be protected to avoid misunderstandings. We dare to present the following request: to promulgate separate regulations for the sale of medical anesthetics in order to facilitate medical treatment and prevent abuses. Before the above regulations are promulgated and implemented, we also request that the military police and local health agencies be ordered to strictly investigate and differentiate them, so that the use of medical treatment is not abolished in the strict prohibition of potent narcotics, and they do not conflict with each other.

<p>After the workers of the British-American Tobacco Company went on strike, the company insisted on not reopening the factory, so it has not been resolved yet. Based on the meeting the day before yesterday, the Strike Committee decided to send three representatives, Chang Xuexuan, Yin Zhigen, and Hu Xiaomei, yesterday with a letter to the Special Party Headquarters of Two Roads, the Trade Union of Two Roads, and the Gui Dong Stevedores' Union, requesting them to stop shipping British-American goods and seal off British-American exports immediately. The representatives of the trade unions accepted the request and promised to seek instructions and provide strong assistance. Yesterday and today were both holidays, so there was not much change in the labor unrest. The female worker propaganda team went to various tea shops, wine shops, and hotels yesterday to promote the cessation of smoking British-American cigarettes. The Strike Committee has scheduled a reception for reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers at 3:00 PM tomorrow at the 9th floor of the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge. Invitation cards have been sent out.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Jianghai Customs Proclamation Exempts Hainan Rubber Export Tax; Limited to Rubber and Raw Rubber <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs issued Proclamation No. 1365 yesterday, regarding the exemption of export and transit taxes on rubber produced in Guangdong and Hainan, as ordered by the Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration. The proclamation stated that export taxes on rubber produced in Guangdong and Hainan when transported overseas and transit taxes on rubber when sold domestically are exempt across the board. From May 26th of this year, when rubber produced in Hainan is transported to foreign countries or domestic trading ports, export taxes or transit taxes should be exempted separately. However, this tax-exempt item refers specifically to raw rubber or raw rubber, not processed rubber. All merchants are notified.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Land Bureau Re-issues Land Certificates for Yinxiang, Zhabei, and Pengpu <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau issued two announcements on the first day of the month regarding the re-issuance of land certificates for households in Yinxiang District, Zhabei District, and Pengpu District.</p>
<p>The first announcement stated that the land of households in the old twenty-third Bao, forty-seventh Tu of Yinxiang District (east to Yangjia Creek, south to Nanhong Creek and Yangshupu Port, west to Zoumatang Port, and north to Yinjia Creek and Yinjiazhai North Tugujie Creek) has been cleared and surveyed, and the exchange of land licenses will begin on June 1st. Landowners in the area should promptly bring their old field deeds and the recent three年的粮串, as well as other evidence of ownership, to the bureau for exchange. After verifying that the grain quota is consistent, the old deeds will be stored in the bureau for cancellation, and a receipt will be issued to receive the map. After signing for recognition for three months, the land bureau's business license will be obtained for management. Do not delay and harm yourselves.</p>
<p>The second announcement stated that the land of households in Tu 1 of Zhabei District (east to Songhu Railway and Diswei Road, south to Jielu Road and Xinjiang Road, west to Tanjialong and Minde Road, and north to Liuying Road and Yingui Road), Tu 4 and Que 3, and the land of households in Tu 2 of Pengpu District (east to Lujiazhai Road and Minde Road, south to Qiujiang Road and Zhongxing Road, west to Pengyue District, and north to Zhao Jiazhai and Maojia Lane) was cleared and issued with a business license more than 20 years ago by the Baoshan Clearing and Survey Bureau. Since then, there have been many cases of division, merger, road construction, river filling, and even sales without transfer procedures. The grain collection has been inconsistent between the deed holder and the landowner. In order to reorganize the land, the bureau has re-cleared and surveyed the land and will begin exchanging land licenses on May 31st. Landowners in the area should promptly bring their square deeds, grain串, or the land business license with the old number previously issued by the bureau, as well as other evidence of ownership, to the bureau to complete the license exchange procedure within one month for management. The land ownership is concerned, so do not delay.</p>

<p>West Sports Road is a major road connecting the concession and the city center. The surrounding land is actively traded due to the eagerness of buyers. The price per mu has risen to over 5,000 taels, and it is still difficult to obtain land along the road. It is rumored that all the land along the road from Hongkou Park to the Xiangyin Road intersection was purchased by large merchants and the financial sector before the January 28th Incident. Recently, after the news of the Central Bank's purchase of the pier on Qiujiang River was disclosed, real estate operators believe that the future prospects of the land along West Sports Road are greater than other areas. Therefore, even with a good price, the landowners are still unwilling to sell. New fences and construction projects are underway everywhere along the road, resembling the scene on Yu Yuan Road in the western district three or four years ago.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that a Danish man, Colonel S.D. Georgiensen, a member of the Shanghai Leading River Concession, had designed and built a small speedboat, the "Danaskotte," at the end of last year. He departed from the Customs Wharf at 6:00 PM on the first of the month, preparing to cross the East China Sea to Nagasaki. He was accompanied by N.D. Fujisheng, an employee of the Wante Company, and one Chinese boatman, for a total of three people. The boat has two masts, is 27 feet long and 9 feet wide, and has a total tonnage of 2.5 tons. It was built in Shanghai at the end of last year with joint funding from a Scottish friend. The name of the boat is a combination of the names of Denmark and Scotland. The front of the boat has a cabin painted green that can accommodate two people. The stern is a semi-cruiser type. The hull is all white. The rigging is modeled after Chinese sails. The boat is equipped with a 24-horsepower engine, and its speed is 4-5 knots. The T-type Ford style.</p>
<p>There have been four previous attempts to cross from Shanghai to Nagasaki by speedboat (the "Curlew" and "Nidaros" in 1931, 1932, and 1933). The previous crossings took six days. This time, the voyage is still scheduled to follow the same route, stopping at Wusong for one day and night, departing for Japan on the morning of the second, and planning to tour the Japanese coast depending on the conditions upon arrival, returning to Shanghai around the end of this month. However, according to Japanese reports, the sea route is known as a "devil's sea" and is often plagued by sharks (man-eating fish), but Georgiensen paid no attention to it.</p>

<p>The mutual lawsuit between former Jiangsu Provincial Government Civil Affairs Director Koo Renfa and his wife Li Shuyun, regarding Li's accusation of Koo's bigamy and the counterclaim by Li's mother and daughter for false accusation, has been approved by the Wuxi Court. The court continued to hold an investigatory hearing at 2:00 PM yesterday. Therefore, Li Shuyun left the hospital at 8:00 AM yesterday morning to visit her mother at a relative's house. She hired a car again to go to her uncle Li Wenhui's residence at No. 36 Puqing Lane, Malong Road, French Concession. After a brief chat, she quickly went to the North Railway Station and took the Beijing-Shanghai express train to Wuxi around 9:00 AM. Her uncle Wenhui did not accompany her. Li wore cloth clothes that day, looked thin, and hurried onto the train, appearing very rushed. It is also known that Li and her daughter stayed at the house of Zhang Baoheng, a friend of her uncle, at No. 17 Zhongshi Bridge, Wuxi, that night. They may stay in Wuxi for several days. However, it is rumored that if Koo still does not appear in court, the Wuxi court will transfer the case to the Jiangning Court for handling.</p>

<p>Chinese Detective Liu Changgen of the Yangshupu Police Station, along with Chinese Detectives No. 44, No. 542, and No. 849, checked passengers on Tram No. 223 near Meizhou Road, Yangshupu Road, around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday. A person from Qingkou named Song Debiao acted suspiciously. Five packages of red pills, each containing 495 pills, were found under his seat. A ten-yuan banknote, a five-yuan banknote, a two-dime coin, and twenty copper coins, a bill, and a pencil were found on his person, and he was taken to the police station. The head of the police ordered his detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department stated the previous situation and filed a public prosecution according to Article 6 of the Opium Suppression Law. The evidence was presented for inspection. When questioned, the defendant claimed that the red pills belonged to other passengers, and the bill was a record of a loan from his friend Wang Wu. He said he lived at No. 29 Shaoxing Road and lived with his cousin Chen Hailin. According to the Chinese and Western detectives, the only people sitting next to the defendant during the search were a well-dressed man and woman, who did not seem like red pill dealers. Detective Liu said that he had inquired at the defendant's home, and Chen Hailin said that he did not know him and had no cousin named Song Debiao. Judge Huang Risheng ordered him to be remanded in custody and the date changed to investigate and verify the facts.</p>

<p>Zhou Liangru, the owner of Zhou Yulong Tannery in Sanpailou, in the city, went to the De Taixing Money Exchange outside Dadongmen Langjia Bridge on the day before yesterday to exchange silver dollars for banknotes amounting to 450 yuan. As he turned to return to his shop and passed the Yuxing Bridge intersection on Zhaojia Road, he was suddenly stopped by three robbers wearing blue-green and blue-black short clothes. They took out handguns, warned him to keep silent, and robbed all the banknotes hidden on Zhou's body. They fled with the stolen goods into the Manlajiao Alley. Afterwards, Zhou reported the robbery to the Second Precinct of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Police Chief Long Hongxiang was dispatched to investigate the scene of the incident and reported it to the headquarters for record, and requested that all precincts be notified for assistance.</p>

<p>Gu Zuoyun, a native of Songjiang residing at No. 478 Kangti Road, French Concession, is 23 years old and works as a gymnastics teacher at the Chinese Children's Public School. He is friendly with Ye Gongli, a native of Hangzhou who used to work in the military. He once lent Ye five silver dollars and two sets of Western clothes. Through Ye's introduction, he met Lin Luo Shi (named Luo Zhinan, 22 years old this year), a woman from Yixing who lived in Zhoujiaqiao, Huxi. Lin's husband, Lin Guoguang, 30 years old this year, is also from Yixing. He used to work in the Communist Party. He was related to the attempted assassination of former Finance Minister Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station the year before last.</p>

<p>He was released from prison on the 11th of last month. He is now working as an informant for arresting communists in the Chinese area. Around 5:00 PM on the 29th of last month, Chen Sanda (30 years old), a native of Yixing, came to Gu's residence and said to Gu, "Ye Gongli is preparing to return the silver dollars and clothes he borrowed. He is waiting for you at Room 12 of the Ningfeng Hotel, No. 524 Minguo Road. I was sent to invite you to collect them." Gu believed it was true and went with Chen. When they arrived at Room 12 of the Ningfeng Hotel, Ye was not there, only Lin Luo Shi was inside. Gu knew Shi, so he sat down</p>

<p>Before they had said three words, three men rushed in, namely Shi's husband, Lin Guoguang, and Lü Tinghou (28 years old, from Shuyang), and Tan Tangjin (30 years old, from Yixing, residing at No. 21 Gujia Lane, Shenjiaqiao). They entered the room and accused Gu of being a Communist Party member, claiming to be special agents of the Public Security Bureau. Gu, who had never joined the Communist Party, argued vehemently. At this time, Lin Guoguang slapped Gu's cheek, accused him of having a relationship with his wife, forced Gu to compensate for all losses, and forced Gu to sign a written statement and a cohabitation agreement with Luo Shi. Lü and Tan pretended to mediate from the side. Gu, unable to resist, had to comply, and</p>

<p>Later, Lin and others were afraid that Gu would go back on his word and deny it after going out, so they forced Gu to find a guarantor before allowing him to regain his freedom. At this point, Gu had no choice but to go with Lin and others to Nan Wansheng Sauce Garden on Luban Road, Lujiawan, in the Chinese area. First, he asked Zhu Deshun, a shop assistant at the garden, to write a guarantee. Lin and others did not trust Zhu, so Gu asked Mei Xiangtao, the owner of the garden, to write a guarantee. The guarantee stated that Gu Zuoyun and Luo Zhinan had a relationship, and were found by Luo's husband Lin Guoguang. All losses must be compensated, and Luo Zhinan escaped with all her clothes and other items. The Gu family is willing to compensate, and the guarantor is fully responsible, within one day.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the guarantor will be held responsible. After seeing this guarantee, Lin and others were satisfied and allowed Gu to move freely and dispersed. Afterwards, Gu felt resentful that Lin and others had colluded to extort money, so he reported it to the French police station. Detective Yang Wei was sent to investigate and arrested Lin and his wife Luo Shi, as well as Lü, Tan, Chen, and others, and brought out three written statements. After questioning by the head of the police, Lin confessed that there was another written statement that had been submitted to the Public Security Bureau, and admitted that he had repented of being a communist and surrendered, and was now working as a special agent. The head of the police ordered them to be detained and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday. Judge Xiong Huitui interrogated them. Lawyer Yuan Jiahong of the police station explained the case and requested that the defendants be detained</p>

<p>Later, he asked to be questioned and tried. He also presented the written statements brought out to the court. Then, the plaintiff Gu Zuoyun recounted the situation. After briefly questioning the defendants, Lin Luo Shi confessed that she had a relationship with Gu Zuoyun and had committed adultery in two places, the Jiangsu Hotel and the Jinling Apartment. The court decided that the case was complicated, so it ordered a postponement of seven days for another hearing. The defendants were remanded in custody. The court also stated that the plaintiff also had untruthful statements, and instructed the investigating officers to conduct a thorough investigation of the case, and ordered the Jiangsu Hotel and Jinling Apartment doormen to bring their logbooks to court for questioning next time.</p>

<p>Passengers Should Be Cautious</p>
<p>Gouravieff (transliteration), a Russian woman residing at No. 65 Maiyang Road, French Concession, hired rickshaw No. 6932 pulled by Guan Lixiang, a 34-year-old Jiangbei native residing on Fulili Road, at 12:00 noon on the first day of this month to return home. She was holding a purse containing two silver dollars. Unexpectedly, the rickshaw puller had evil intentions, thinking that the passenger's purse must contain a large sum of money or valuable jewelry. When he pulled the rickshaw to a remote location near the Russian woman's home on Maiyang Road, he stopped the rickshaw and forcibly robbed the purse. Because the Russian woman shouted, Guan untied a strip of blue cloth belt from his waist, put it over the woman's head, and strangled her violently, pushing her to the ground. He robbed the purse and pulled the rickshaw away. Later, the Russian woman managed to loosen the strangling belt herself. Fortunately, she remembered the rickshaw number and reported it to the French police station. Detective Wu Jiahui was dispatched to investigate and found that rickshaw No. 6932 belonged to the Henghe Rickshaw Company on Albé Road. He inquired with the company and arrested Guan, bringing the original stolen goods to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Xiong questioned him. Lawyer Yuan Jiahong of the police station solemnly stated the case and requested a postponement for investigation to see if the defendant had committed other crimes, and requested temporary detention for investigation before prosecuting him. After the court briefly questioned the defendant, it ordered a postponement of seven days for another hearing. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>The Huxi Commercial Center has been open since the 14th of last month. According to the decision, the meeting period is three weeks.

<h3 id="e172">The Public Works Department Rejects Small-Scale Public Bonds; There Are Complaints from Outside <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Great American Evening News said, "The Public Works Department issued 7 million yuan of 5% interest bonds this time, and the amount raised exceeded the quota by three times in 15 minutes. It is now heard that all those who subscribed for less than 1,000 yuan have had their checks returned. The reasons given are not satisfactory. Therefore, there are complaints from outside that the Public Works Department has violated the original agreement of public distribution and allowed banks and syndicates to underwrite the bonds. The total amount of those who subscribed for less than 1,000 yuan accounts for only a small portion of the total amount. In principle, they should be allocated in full to be fair. The Public Works Department's rejection of small-scale subscribers is a big mistake. If larger bonds are issued in the future, if small-scale subscribers are wary of being rejected this time and hesitate to move forward, it is feared that it will be affected."

<p>The Shanghai Bar Association received a letter from the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court yesterday, stating, "In accordance with the opening hours of civil and criminal cases accepted by our court, they are marked in the summons and notification letters. If the judges do not open the court for trial immediately after the parties report, the parties or their agents will arrive late, which delays the trial time of each case in turn. In addition to criminal cases, we will consult with the French Concession Police Department to expedite the trial. In order to organize the office, from now on, the civil court will regularly summon each case for trial. We hope that you will forward this to the agent lawyer and hope that they will abide by the time specified in the summons, bring the party to report, fill out the registration form, and hand it over to the staff at the registration office. Notify the court to open immediately without delay, which is very important." After receiving the letter, the association has notified all members to check and handle it.</p>

The four walls were full of works, with 500 to 600 pieces on display. From morning to night, thousands of people visited. In a few hours, many calligraphy and paintings had been booked. Feng Wenfeng's calligraphy was booked the most. Dozens of paintings by Chen Xiaocui, Li Qiujun, Xie Yingxin, Gu Qingyao, Zhou Lianxia, Yu Weidan, Wu Qingxia, Jiang Yanan, and Xie Yuemei were also booked. After Tang Guanyu's work was sold, she immediately donated it to the association's expenses. In addition, female writers collaborated on silk fans, using a raffle method, with each ticket costing two yuan. People scrambled to draw on the spot, and more than half of them were sold in an instant. It is expected that there will be an even grander occasion today.</p>
<p>Also, Huang Binhong wrote a record of the women's calligraphy and painting exhibition, "Recently, the prosperity of culture in the southeast is concentrated in Shanghai. The construction of various art schools is full of talent. The fun of family life, entertaining the mind and elegance, is outstanding and difficult to count. Some originate from family learning, and some are similar to teachers. Songxue's good couple are called virtuous Zhong Jihengshan granddaughters. Yang Xiuwen's books are not biased towards Wuyue. The achievements are comparable to the Song and Yuan dynasties. Respecting the profession and enjoying the group, learning from each other, there is the Chinese Women's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition, which is truly a pioneering event. For example, the seal script and regular script of Feng Wenfeng and Yang Wanhua, the poetry and writing of Chen Xiaocui, Gu Qingyao, and Gu Mofei, are both good at calligraphy and painting. Yu Jingzhi and Wu Qingxia's figure paintings, Yu Danhan, Li Qiujun, Yang Xuejiu, Xie Yingxin, Jiang Yanan, Huang Yingfen, and Lu Xiaoman's landscape paintings, Tang Guanyu, Ding Yunbi, Xie Yuemei, Zhou Lianxia, Yang Xueyao, Zhang Shimin, Weng Wenbi, Bao Qiongzhi, Pang Zuoyu, and Bao Yaqian's flower and bird paintings, are all famous works, with nothing missing.

<p>various records, limited to the corners. Hundreds of years and thousands of miles may not be at the same time. Now, many people are collected and displayed in several rooms, like a flower cluster, with gold titles, and the Art Department of Lilli Company is also happy to assist. It's a beautiful day. However, mountains and rivers are blocked, and the genres are different. Accumulated habits have become a trend. The sweetness and weakness of Wumen, the triviality of Huating, the roughness of Minjiang, and the emptiness of Xin'an are all criticized by connoisseurs. If the accumulated evils continue, we should think of ways to correct them. It can be seen that the progress of art depends on the discussion of like-minded people. How can it be limited to rising day by day?</p>

<p>Shen Yinmo and Shen Maishi exhibited their recent works at the Lake Society. Yesterday was the first day. The reporter went to visit. The walls were full of exhibits. Yinmo's calligraphy included a scroll of Leisurely Living, a middle hall of Vow Documents, a book of Stupa Temple inscriptions, various epitaph rubbings, and couplets of regular, running, cursive, and cursive scripts. The legal system was strict, the skeleton was majestic and strong, and it was upright and unpretentious, and the roundness was like a ring. It has the aura of a dragon flying and a tiger jumping, which is far from what historical figures can reach. Maishi's paintings imitated ancient scenery, and all were exquisite, such as imitating Juran Yellow Crane and writing landscape albums, Lushan, Wuyi, Fuchun River, Emei, and other paintings. The brushwork was capable of lifting a tripod, and still had a graceful and neat charm. The gods and reasons were combined, and vulgarity was completely deleted. Finger painting came from skillful hands, especially full of nature. In addition, the fan faces co-operated by the two Shen brothers were linked together like pearls, and there were many fine structures. In short, everything made by people can not follow vulgarity, not cling to the old, and not aim to be strange and different. The uprightness contains changes, and the majesty shows elegance. It should be praised by the visitors.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Part of the Land Declaration in This City Has Been Completed - Active Land Surveying is Underway <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the land declaration, this matter was discussed in detail at the recent financial conference, and an outline has been approved, which will be circulated to all provinces and cities for compliance. However, the land problem in this city is particularly complicated due to the mixture of Chinese and foreigners compared to other places. According to a spokesperson for the Land Bureau of this city, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, part of the land declaration in this city has already been completed due to the collection of temporary land value tax. However, because the Land Law Implementation Regulations have not yet been promulgated, whether the procedures currently performed by the owners should be re-performed in the future depends on whether the method stipulated in the Land Law Implementation Regulations is the same as the existing method. However, according to general practice, land declarations should be held every three years, because land conditions are constantly changing, and the land changes in this city are even more significant than elsewhere. Therefore, if the Land Law Implementation Regulations are promulgated within three years, the land declaration procedures should be re-performed. Currently, this city plans to complete the land survey of the entire city within three years, because handling land declaration matters is closely related to land surveying. Now that the central government is paying special attention to land declaration matters, land surveying in this city will be actively carried out.</p>

<p>I am writing to you because I read in your newspaper's local news section yesterday that our station (District 34) was obstructing the New Life Movement and that Yu Zhenhui, a staff member of the Municipal Farmers' Association, was detained by our station and released after the mediation of Pan Mingding, a member of the Municipal Affairs Committee of Gaohang District, and Su Shude, a supervisory committee member of the Fifth District Party Department. This is not in accordance with the facts and concerns the administrative reputation of our station. Therefore, I would like to briefly describe the actual situation on that day. It was found that Yu Zhenhui and others were brought in by Liang Wenlin, the police chief of the downstairs police station, at about 6:00 PM on May 27, who reported that Zhu Hongchang, a member of the Gaohang District Security Corps, and Yu Zhenhui, a staff member of the Municipal Farmers' Association, had a dispute with a local farmer, Sun Fusheng, over a seat while watching a play in Shagang today, and unexpectedly, Yu Zhenhui and others beat the villager Sun Fusheng, causing his head to bleed profusely. He was immediately taken to the rescue team of Qunji Hospital for medication and treatment, and Yu Zhenhui then entered the hospital and beat him again. Fortunately, the director of the hospital dissuaded him, but Yu and others were still angry and wanted to take Sun Fusheng to the Gaohang District Security Corps. Later, Wan Lantian reported the incident, so they were brought to the station together. After investigation, our station learned that Sun Fusheng claimed that he was watching a play in Shagang today, and it was crowded, so he found a high stool. Unexpectedly, Zhu Hongchang, a member of the Gaohang District Security Corps, and Yu Zhenhui, a staff member of the Municipal Farmers' Association, forcibly took the stool. Because he refused to give it up, he was beaten by Yu Zhenhui and others, who falsely accused him of gambling. Yu Zhenhui claimed that he was ordered by the mayor to investigate the New Life Movement in various districts. On the day in question, he was passing through Shagang, Gaoqiao, and saw the villager Sun Fusheng gambling with cigarettes in the theatre so he interferred, leading to the reported contention. But this is a small matter, and he requests forgiveness. (Zhu Hongchang and Yu Zhenhui stated the same.) According to the interrogation, the crime was an injury, and the statements of the plaintiffs and defendants were different, so the case should be resolved by the bureau immediately. However, the head of our station was on official business in Shanghai, so the patrol officer dared not make a decision without authorization. At the same time, Yu Zhenhui and others requested bail, which was immediately granted. The next day, the head of our station returned to the station, and Sun Fusheng came to the station again to ask for justice.</p>
<p>The head of our station immediately ordered the police to summon Yu, but Yu and others hid and did not arrive. This is the actual situation on that day. In addition to reporting the details of the case to the superiors, a corresponding factual letter was sent to your newspaper, hoping that the letter would be published so that the public would be aware of the situation and avoid misunderstandings. Please accept my best wishes for your health. Zhan Chun, the head of the Third District, Dama Police Station, Shanghai Public Security Bureau, respectfully.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Yesterday I read in your newspaper that our factory had a fire caused by burning opium paste, but this is not in accordance with the facts. I am writing to you to request a correction in order to maintain our reputation. The actual facts are as follows: Our factory, Wu Hua Chang Machine Factory, has always been located on Haining Road. Because the original building was old, we moved to Shaonian Road last month and have only been there for a month. The wooden house on the cool platform was used to store new and old goods in the machine room. Moreover, the wooden house had only been built for a week, and the carpentry had just been completed, so the appliance had not yet been cleared out. The cause of the fire was probably due to the shop assistants eating and throwing cigarette butts around. The cause of the fire is unknown. The fire occurred at 4:00 AM in the morning, while we were still asleep. We were awakened by the shouts of our neighbors. Your newspaper's report of burning opium paste is shocking. I have never had a smoking habit, so where would the opium paste come from? I believe this is a misrepresentation of the facts. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction. I am deeply grateful. Wu Hua Chang Factory, June 2nd.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Special Article - Refutation of Foreign Misinterpretation of Pilotage Treaty - Declaration of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Pilotage Association <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Since the opening of trade, foreigners have plotted against us. What is obvious on the surface is that they have taken advantage of their power to bully the weak, intimidate with threats, and exploit unequal treaties. But few people know about their many covert tricks and insidious intentions. Their usual methods are nothing more than insinuation and calumny, exploiting the ability to seize by any means. It is found that our country's pilotage sovereignty has not been lost in the treaties in the slightest. The only basis for foreigners to serve as pilots in our country is the Pilotage Regulations approved by the Zongli Yamen by Hart, the Inspector General of Customs, in the seventh year of Tongzhi, which allows both Chinese and foreigners to serve equally. This is an administrative order of the official government and not an international treaty, as everyone knows. However, foreigners intentionally invaded and took an inch further. They colluded with customs commissioners and organized pilotage examination committees in various ports, not allowing Chinese officials to participate, and tried their best to employ foreigners and exclude Chinese people. Not only did the right to examination turn from guest to host, but the more important territorial sovereignty was also invisibly occupied. Obstructed passes and fortresses were freely entered and exited. Military defeats have been suffered in the past, as in the Battle of Mawei in Fujian and Tanggu in Tianjin, where enemy warships were led into the harbor, destroying our navy. More recently, during the January 28th Incident, Japanese warships were led in to fight, inflicting great losses on the 19th Route Army. Afterwards, Philip, the manager of the Shanghai Yangtze Pilotage Association, received the Order of the Rising Sun, as its war honor. The severity of the harm has made people throughout the country grieve with anger. Therefore, there is a consensus that the sovereignty of Chinese pilotage must be recovered as soon as possible in order to eliminate future troubles. On the foreign side, in order to resist, they insinuate that foreigners serving as pilots in our country have a treaty relationship in order to cover up their forcible occupation. This association once published an article in various newspapers on March 17 of this year to make careful corrections. However, the Oriental Affairs Monthly published by foreigners in this port, in its April issue, published an article entitled "Shanghai Pilots," which still forcefully argued and distorted the meaning of the treaty. Therefore, misinterpretations were made to confuse the public and numb people's hearts. This association is afraid that these accumulated errors will become true, so it must be refuted. Therefore, the outline is described, followed by a translation, and then a declaration, so that readers can understand the ins and outs, and distinguish between right and wrong. It is not a concern that the words are too long. Now, let us cite the translation, which says:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times of March 17 published a message saying that the Shanghai Pilots Association (Chinese) had made a public statement to the effect that the Chinese government had never allowed foreigners to occupy the right to pilot in Chinese territorial waters in any treaty. This declaration was made in response to rumors that the Consular Corps was meeting on the pilotage issue and arguing that the issue should be decided by the countries concerned. The Chinese Pilotage Association further stated that the Chinese government had decided to recover the pilotage rights currently enjoyed by foreigners. (Unfinished)</p>
<p>Readers' Questions and Answers</p>
<h3 id="e195">How to Write a Diary—Answering Mr. Wang Zaifu— <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang wrote, inquiring about how to write a diary. He said that whenever he tries to write a diary, he always feels that there is nothing to write, and thus doubts the effectiveness of diary writing in self-cultivation. To answer this question, first, we must strengthen Mr. Wang's confidence in writing a diary; second, we must find out the reasons why he encounters difficulties.</p>
<p>Writing a diary plays an extremely important role in the process of studying, which should be acknowledged by anyone with a little experience in studying. On one hand, it can train writing skills; on the other hand, it can gradually expand one's thinking. At the same time, if it is regarded as a record of life, it can encourage oneself and spur oneself to move towards the future one should pursue.</p>
<p>We know that ordinary people cannot freely wield their pens when writing articles. This is not only because of the constraints of the subject matter, but also because the article is written for others to read, and great efforts are often required in phrasing and sentence construction. This leads to the phenomenon that it is not the author who uses the words, but the words that drive the author, creating a clear separation between the words and the content. In reality, words cannot express the meaning, and may even obscure true feelings and thoughts. Therefore, the author cannot but regard writing as a difficult task. So the ancients said, "Articles are inherently heaven-sent," which is partly based on this situation. This makes it very difficult for beginners to improve, whether in terms of writing skills or thinking. However, writing a diary can completely break all of this!</p>
<p>Writing a diary is extremely free, entirely based on the author's free expression. Its content is the content of the author's entire life. It is the most effective way to cultivate the author's ability to unify writing skills within the content. It gives the author the opportunity to practice writing skills for a long time, without subjecting the author to the slightest constraint of words. Of course, our attitude is serious, but we absolutely do not need any concerns or pretenses. Poor writing is not important, and immature thinking is not important either. We are not writing for others to read, but for ourselves to read; to train ourselves, to review ourselves; to organize and refine our daily lives. If we continue in this way, how can our thinking not develop? Only with organized thinking can we have clear and smooth writing. Writing a diary is definitely the best way for beginners to train their minds and writing skills.</p>
<p>However, why does Mr. Wang always feel that there is nothing to write when writing a diary? We believe that the difficulties Mr. Wang encounters are due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>First, he regards diary writing only as a tool for practicing writing skills. He has not broken the concept of viewing writing as a daunting task, so he often struggles to search for words and sentences, while turning a blind eye to daily life, or not daring to bring his own mundane life content to the tip of his pen. These are all mistakes! We absolutely do not believe that a modern person has no life to record. Mr. Wang is a shop apprentice, so the people Mr. Wang comes into contact with are very complex, and the things he experiences will definitely not be simple. Are these not all materials for a diary? Are these materials not enough for Mr. Wang to use? But the reason why Mr. Wang has nothing to write is that as soon as he picks up a pen, he puts all his attention on the use of words, constantly harboring the fear that his words are not enough, so he feels that writing "this" is not good, and writing "that" is not possible, and as a result, many materials slip away from under his pen. Mr. Wang must have read some famous people's diaries, thinking that their diaries are all outstanding works with every word like a pearl. But this is not the case. What they are selling is not goods that have been sealed and untouched, but refurbished counterfeits. "These" are not worth imitating, and should not scare oneself away.</p>
<p>Second, he limits the content of the diary to personal private life. Furthermore, he isolates his private life from society. In this way, the diary becomes nothing more than a personal record of daily life, and when writing, apart from the rigid routines of what time to get up, what time to sleep, how many times to go to the toilet, how many bowls of rice to eat, etc., one will naturally feel that there is nothing to record. Why should we do this? Can't we broaden our horizons? Our lives may be ordinary, with little change, but can't we obtain infinite new materials from what we see and hear every day, and from books, newspapers, and conversations with friends? We can express our own opinions and feelings on even the most trivial issues, regardless of whether our opinions are right or wrong. When you see a policeman beating a rickshaw puller, do you not have any feelings? When you see a beggar asking for money from a store, do you not have any feelings? If so, your diary material is inexhaustible and inexhaustible, so how can you still feel that there is nothing to write?</p>
<p>Finally, he treats diary writing as a rigid task like eating. Of course, writing a diary is most likely to encourage people to reflect on themselves and understand society, because without doing so, there really would be nothing to write, and it would be meaningless. But conversely, we cannot handle it too mechanically, and should give it a lot of freedom. If one day we really have nothing worth writing about—no true feelings of our own, no true opinions of our own—we should simply not write, without having to fabricate anything, without having to write about eating and sleeping to muddle through. This is completely useless. Otherwise, over a longer period of time, you will inevitably feel difficult and bored, and develop a dislike for writing a diary.</p>
<p>Based on the above explanations, we sincerely hope that readers who are just beginning to write a diary, like Mr. Wang, must remember: in terms of technique, you must develop the habit of writing whatever you want to write, and writing long when you have something to say and short when you have nothing to say. You should never be constrained by phrasing and sentence construction, so as not to hinder the development of thought. In terms of content, you should free yourself from personal life, and treat the things around you, and even the entire social life, as diary material. In this way, you will not encounter obstacles in writing, and you will definitely not encounter the difficulty of having nothing to write again. I wonder if Mr. Wang thinks so?</p>

<h3 id="e196">China Lawn Tennis Club's Second Exhibition Match: A Grand Gathering of Chinese and Foreign Tennis Players. Starts at 3 PM at the Club's Courts on Singapore Road.

They will be impressive today. Lin Baohua has long enjoyed a great reputation. He and Xu will fight against the two Westerners, claiming to be a perfect partnership. The Westerners Carson and Pan are also not to be trifled with. Carson's skills have improved in recent years and he has long been famous in Shanghai. Pan was the leader of the Cambridge tennis scene when he was in England. These two Westerners are worthy rivals for Lin and Xu, so today's program will be exciting and unexpected.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Liu Changchun's Letter to Wang Lan Explains Reasons for Failure <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>He did not practice hard enough in Shanghai, his body became fat, and his weight increased by ten pounds. (Ping News) According to Wang Lan, Liu Changchun's failure made me extremely suspicious, because the results of this competition were not very high. According to Liu Changchun's strength, he certainly had hope of winning a place. But when the news came, it made people feel infinitely disappointed, because I knew that in order to wipe out his shame and hatred, he had worked hard and persevered for years. It is heartbreaking to encounter an unexpected failure. I received two letters from him in the last ten days, one sent before the competition and one sent after the defeat. The letter before the competition was full of descriptions of how he was supported by others and how he felt a great responsibility. This kind of tense situation was also a reason for his failure. The most recent letter arrived in Ping this morning. It is a self-report of his mood after the defeat and the true cause of his failure. Many people who care about Liu Changchun, I will publish it publicly. The following are Liu Changchun's reasons:</p>
<p>Brother Lan,</p>
<p>It's over, I have been eliminated. I am extremely ashamed. My four-year ambition has been reduced to nothing. Now I don't want to think about anything anymore. I'm just waiting for the public to give me a fair scolding.</p>
<p>The weather was cloudy and hot that day, making it difficult for people to breathe. When I went down to the court, I didn't feel very hot, nor was I afraid of the battle, but I couldn't use any strength when I ran. In the 100-meter start, I was beaten by Yoshioka by two meters, and in the end, there was still a difference of two meters. In the 200-meter start, I was second at 100 meters. Everyone thought that my stamina was good, and I would definitely be able to get first place. I thought so too, but when I reached 30 meters from the finish line, I couldn't use any strength in my whole body. In the end, I was overtaken by the second and third place. The 100 meters was the same. However, according to my usual results in these two events, I am very confident in getting second place in the final, but the strength I used on that day felt uneasy and not suitable. After running, I didn't feel very tired, as if there was still strength I hadn't used. After the game, Ma John and I investigated the reason. It was because I didn't always use full strength in practice in Shanghai, because I was afraid of ruining my legs. As a result, I didn't practice hard enough, so my body became fat. Originally, my body weighed 138 pounds, but now it is 148 pounds, plus the hot weather, so I couldn't use my strength. My name will be scolded for thousands of years, and I will have no day to wipe out my shame in this life. Now I don't watch any games anymore, I'm just waiting to be scolded when I return to the country. I wish you well. Your brother Changchun bows his head, May 17th</p>

<p>The track and field meet of the Shanghai Chinese Middle School Sports Federation closed yesterday. Guanghua won the men's field event championship, Jinan won the track event championship, and Patriotic won the women's championship. At this competition, all women's track and field events set new records, and men's events set two field event records and five track event records. After the competition, Ms. Lu Wenying was invited to present the awards on the spot. The results of the competition and the scores of each school are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e201">Men's Field Events <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>

<p>(7) Jinan 3 points (8) Pudong 3 points</p>

<p>(5) Pudong 8 points (6) Hujiang 5 points</p>
<p>(7) Fuzhong 3 points (8) Minli 1 point</p>

<p>(3) Daxia 8 points (4) Nanshang 7 points</p>
<p>(5) Guanghua 3 points</p>

<p>Shu Changge from Fuzhong is tall and strong, and his rotation is also in accordance with the regulations, so the results he pushes out are always like a crane standing out from a flock of chickens. Xie Dansheng from Nanshang is also a promising talent. The difference between his results and the champion is only "a little bit".</p>
<h3 id="e205">Pole Vault <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>In the past, Li Lin from Fudan was still able to barely satisfy people, but after Li left, there was no outstanding figure in the Chinese Sports Federation team. Gu Jiazheng's 2.93 meters is enough to look down on everything. It is said that there are no great generals in Shu, and Liao Hua is the vanguard.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Triple Jump <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>This item makes people feel unbearable to look back</p>
<p>Women's Track and Field Champion Patriotic</p>
<p>— (Qi Chang Photograph)</p>
<p>Alas, Wang Jihuai used to have an excellent record of 13.13 meters, but Feng Yuanchang from Shanghai Middle only earned 12.32 meters. But there is still a long way to go. Encourage him.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Javelin <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Pan Baozhen from Guanghua's throwing posture can be said to be inheriting Wang Jihuai's mantle, but his strength is not good, which is his big flaw. The second-place Liao Tanqing has a posture and physical strength that are both among the best.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Women's Shot Put <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Guan Yanjiao from Patriotic has a spirit of hard work. Her pushing style deliberately imitates the posture of the female iron bull Ma Zijun. Her result is 8.19 meters, which is an improvement over Chen Ruiping's 7.40 meters.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Women's Long Jump <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Kang Tong from Guanghua's 3.31 meters in the previous competition has already been sitting on the throne. Rong Shujian's 4.15 meters in this competition has improved very quickly. Even the second-place Zhang Minzhi can jump out of 4 meters, which is really rare.</p>
<p>A Look at the Track</p>
<h3 id="e210">100 Meters <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Dong Yinchu from Guanghua felt terrified by Zeng Rongzhong's compelling momentum the day before, so he had the determination to win at the start. The four people in the top four were advancing shoulder to shoulder in the first 50 meters, and then Dong began to take the lead by one head at the 80-meter mark. Li from Daxia was behind Zeng Rongzhong. By the time they reached the finish line, the four people were no more than one foot apart. The result of this item was 11.3 seconds, which is very new and gratifying.</p>
<h3 id="e211">200 Meters <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>After being defeated by Dong Yinchu in the 100 meters, Zeng Rongzhong's anger was visible on his face. As soon as the gun sounded, only smoke and dust rose on the track, and horses' hooves flew. A pair of iron horses broke out of the formation. Zeng began to take the lead at 150 meters. Li Songnian from Daxia still got third place. Feng Yuqi from Hujiang, unfortunately, is not familiar with the start, otherwise Li Songnian would be in danger. The result is 23.3 seconds, which is still acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="e212">800 Meters <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Yuqing has added a long-distance running veteran, Wang Zhenglin,</p>
<p>Her iron face was merciless, and her heart was trembling, which made her lose her usual form, resulting in a lack of decisiveness at the start and finishing fourth.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Women's 100 Meters <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Minzhi is very good at getting up at the crow of a cock, which is in line with the occasion, but her sprinting strength is not as good as Li Keling. The result of this item is 15 seconds, which is quite immature.</p>

It is also reported that Zou Shande, a star player from the school, has exceeded his own record in the National Games in the high jump. However, he injured his foot while practicing the high jump, and it is feared that he will be unable to attend.</p>

<p>The Jiangwan Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School in this city held a revival commemoration last month. The first day was the track and field meet.

Recently, it was changed to yesterday due to the city's primary school sports meet, so the preliminaries were held yesterday and the finals will be held at 9:00 am today. The events include 50 meters, 100 meters, shot put, long jump, discus, 80-meter hurdles, javelin, high jump, softball, etc. The officials are appointed from outside the school, and the school appoints the following: President Lu Lihua, Director Shu Feng, Track Referee Zhang Yuansheng, Field Referee Chen De, Finish Referee Dong Chengkang, Inspector Qian Maofang, Starter Li Jiyuan, Chief Recorder Fei Shunyuan, Referees Chen Fen, Hu Zongfan, Wang Fuxi, Hu Zhengqu, Sun Ming, etc. The venue is the school's track and field.

<p>Law and Politics and Other Schools Raise Protests</p>
<p>According to a letter from the Law and Politics College volleyball team, Chi Chih College was revoked from membership in the Shanghai Joint Sports Meet of Various Independent Colleges for failing to pay membership fees.  The number of participating schools has suddenly decreased, which is obviously inconsistent with the original resolution.  Currently, Law and Politics and other schools have jointly sent a letter to the Organizing Committee requesting a re-drawing of lots for the competition.  The reason stated is that Chi Chih also attended the second meeting of representatives of various schools for ball games at the Zhengfeng Literature College.  At that time, including Chi Chih, a total of seven schools participated in the volleyball competition.  After mutual consultation among the school representatives, it was decided to determine the competition schedule by drawing lots.  Now that Chi Chih has failed to pay membership fees and its membership has been revoked, the previous resolution has therefore changed.  If the old plan is implemented again, it would be obviously illegal.  It is hoped that your committee will immediately convene a general meeting of representatives from various schools to discuss again.  It is reported that the letter has now been submitted to the Organizing Committee, and various schools believe that its reasons are justified and have expressed their support.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Race Club recently launched the Second Members' Trap Shooting Handicap Competition, which was reported in the previous newspaper. It is learned that the competition opened as scheduled the night before. Spectators gathered, and the interest was intense. In the Group A competition, Gong Xinhong surprisingly defeated Lu Shentong with 215 points to 138 points. Usually, Lu is stronger than Gong. Therefore, according to the handicap points, Lu should have had 47 more points. Now, he was defeated. No wonder everyone praised Little Gong. The referee was Chuan Changnian, and the recorder was Lu Xiniao.</p>
<p>In the Group B competition, Shen Gengxiang took advantage of a good opportunity midway and hit 24 consecutive points. He took the lead all the way, showing the descent of a lucky person. Qin tried hard to catch up, but ultimately failed and suffered a crushing defeat. As a result, when Shen scored 155 points, Qin was still 30 points short of the points he should have obtained (actually scored 163 points). The referee was Shi Changmei, and the recorder was Hu Yong'an.</p>

In addition to contacting the factory to negotiate and re-hiring workers to repair it, all games scheduled for yesterday and today have been rescheduled to be held at the first court next week in the original order.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Detailed Record of the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Education Conference <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondent) The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Secondary School Teachers and Staff held an education conference at Zhenjiang Normal School yesterday (the 1st) morning at 9:00 AM. More than 20 representatives from various schools, including Xia Peibai, Liu Mengjin, and Wu Zier, attended. More than 30 important cases were resolved, and the meeting adjourned late at night. The important cases are selected and listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1)  How should students in senior and junior high schools and various vocational schools who wish to pursue further education or service due to changes in environment or interests be remedied? (Resolution 1: For the current first-year students in junior high school, elective courses in vocational fields should be set up to facilitate students' education. 2: For the current first and second-year students in senior high school and vocational schools, elective courses should be set up to meet the needs. 3: Please ask teachers to set up supplementary schools to provide remedies. (2)  The children's army training in rural normal schools should be abolished, and all the time should be changed to military training to save the country from peril. (Resolution) Passed and submitted to the Education Department. (3)  Please request the Education Department to devise ways to compile and improve textbooks for each subject that conform to the progress table for application in the 23rd year. (Resolution) Passed. (4)  How should the difficulties in implementing the progress table for each subject be remedied? (Resolution) Handled in conjunction with the third case. (5)  The use of original textbooks for physics and chemistry makes it difficult for students to learn and reduces educational efficiency. How should this be remedied? (Resolution) In addition to referring to the resolutions of previous science conferences, the Education Department is requested to compile textbooks on mathematics, physics, and chemistry as soon as possible. After the publication of these textbooks, the Education Department is urged to strictly prohibit the use of English textbooks in all schools. (6)  The teaching time for history in the senior high school normal department seems insufficient in terms of curriculum. The original standard should be changed and slightly increased. (Resolution) Submit to the Ministry of Education to change the history teaching time of normal schools to a 4-1 system to facilitate teaching. (7)  The methods for awarding scholarships to poor students should be promulgated and revised and interpreted. (Resolution) Request the Education Department to interpret and promote the minimum standards for excellent and physically fit students and add "those with an average grade of 60 points and no failing grades." (8)  The middle school entrance examination set by the Education Department should be revised. (Resolution) If the Education Department uses a unified method for the enrollment of various schools, the Association does not express any opinion. If the entrance examination is still held separately by each school, the usual practice will be followed, with special emphasis on the four subjects stipulated by the Education Department. As for the Education Department's method of allocating the number of students admitted to normal schools by region, it can only be used as a reference. (9)  Review the regulations on student promotion and retention, supplementary examinations, and academic performance assessment promulgated by the Ministry and submit them to the Education Department. (Resolution) Recommend the Suzhou Middle School, Suzhou Women's Normal School, and Suzhou Agricultural School to review and submit them to the Executive Committee of the Education Association within one week.

<h3 id="e244">The Public Works Department Discusses School Subsidy Issues <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>The subsidy of the Public Works Department to private Chinese schools within the concession, except for two schools, has been decided to be distributed immediately for the first quarter of this year. The Education Committee also decided that, starting in 1935, foreign schools applying for subsidies should first investigate their needs, then submit them to the sub-committee for review, and also have the Hygiene and Public Works Departments add their comments, and then allocate the funds proportionally. As for schools that have already received subsidies, they should be asked to report clearly whether they have been spent for the designated purpose and submit receipts to verify the facts.</p>
<p>The Sanitation Department believes that the sanitation equipment improvement fees given to some schools far exceed their needs. Although the funds they received were all used to improve cleanliness, they exceeded the work specified by the Sanitation Department. Therefore, schools should be asked to report this matter in detail. The Director of Education then suggested that schools requesting subsidies in the future should first be investigated by the Director of Chinese Education to clarify their needs and notify the sub-committee, and then the relevant administrative departments should add their opinions before allocating the subsidies. The committee members agreed with this proposal and decided to do the same for foreign schools.</p>
<p>Regarding those who rent houses to set up schools, the Sanitation Department has conducted investigations into the existence and duration of leases, and will then make suggestions on whether or not to grant sanitation improvement fees and the amount.</p>
<p>Regarding the use of subsidies for school libraries, the sub-committee has given it careful consideration. In general, the granting of funds is not taken as a precedent for the following year. Also, the use of subsidies to purchase experimental equipment is considered appropriate because natural science is part of the middle and primary school curriculum.</p>

<h3 id="e246">How to Read Books? <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>According to my investigation, children under the age of eight do not understand how to protect books. Children around the age of eight cherish their books very much. When they buy a new book, they carefully wrap the cover with paper and are careful not to damage or stain it. They are also very careful when reading it. This attitude of cherishing books is undoubtedly commendable and should be promoted.</p>
<p>However, children should understand that cherishing books is one thing, and reading books is another. Do not let cherishing books hinder reading. What does this mean? For example, when reading an unfamiliar word, feel free to underline it. Do not refrain from underlining it because you are afraid of staining the book. You should know that underlining provides some help in terms of reading methods. Books are ultimately for people to read, not for decoration. Cherishing is ultimately a minor matter. Therefore, I advise children to do three things when reading: First, underline unfamiliar words to calculate how many unfamiliar words you recognize each day and to know the ratio of reading to recognizing unfamiliar words. Second, circle or dot your favorite sentences or sentences with important meaning. This shows that you have already read this article and makes it easier to understand at a glance. Third, this requires older children who read a lot to be able to do. If you have some opinions when reading something, feel free to add marginal notes at the top of the book. As for whether the opinions are correct or not, you do not have to worry about it, because the teacher will correct any errors in thinking.</p>
<p>Finally, I will reiterate: Do not let cherishing books hinder reading.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Model Children of the New Life Movement <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>Propriety Confucius played as a child, arranging sacrificial vessels (i.e., ritual utensils) and practicing rituals. Later, Confucius taught his son Boyu to learn propriety, saying, "If you do not learn propriety, you will have nothing to stand on." Therefore, Boyu also learned propriety.</p>
<p>Righteousness When Washington was eighteen, he was doing surveying work by the Potomac River. A four-year-old child nearby fell into the water. Everyone was afraid to rescue him because the current was too strong. Washington bravely jumped into the river. Despite the danger, he was rescued. He had such a spirit of public service since childhood, so only Washington could be competent as the President of the American Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>Integrity Lincoln was an extremely poor child in his youth. Someone recommended him to be a manager of a cargo store. Once, he miscalculated a woman by four cents. After the market closed in the evening, he walked two or three miles to return it. Another time, he gave someone half a pound of tea less. That night, there was a great storm with thunder. No one was walking on the road. He carried half a pound of tea and walked a long way to return it to the person. People only know him as the savior who liberated black slaves. It turns out that although his childhood environment was poor, his behavior was very honest.</p>
<p>Shame The Germans once succumbed to the iron hooves of Napoleon. After the Franco-Prussian War, the German army triumphed. Bismarck said: "Our success today is all due to the hard work of elementary school teachers who have cultivated many good children over the years. That's why we have these loyal and brave soldiers." It can be seen that to save the country from difficulties, all children in the country must not forget the national humiliation.</p>

<p>Dark red, light red, yellow, white, clusters and clumps, are displayed in the garden, are peaches, apricots, crabapples, roses... there are also some unknown flowers. Draped in the light yarn of the morning sun, they are even more charming and beautiful. Waves of fragrance are sprayed out, rippling in the silent air.</p>
<p>Buzz, buzz, buzz, branches and flowers, entangled with many small things. They busily burrow into the flowers, spreading their wings, extending their beaks, trying to suck something. Suddenly, with a "whoosh" sound, they flew back to their nests, singing triumphant mountain songs.</p>
<p>Children, what are these little things, and what are they busy with?</p>
<p>吧！</p>
<h3 id="e249">High! High! High! Flying High! — The New Air Route — <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Eagle</p>
<p>Airplanes! Are what children love to look up at the most. Flying! Is what the new youth of the twentieth century are most proud of. But pilots in the sky often encounter clouds and fog covering the sky and the earth, losing their sense of direction and unable to see the route, which is very dangerous. Sometimes encountering strong winds and heavy rain in the air is like a lonely boat trapped in the waves of the sea, making it impossible to steer, which is also extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Scientists, in order to reduce the dangers of aviation and find a safe route for pilots, are now about to succeed in their experiment!</p>
<p>Where is this new air route?</p>
<p>It turns out that the upper layer of the atmosphere, about eleven kilometers above the ground, is called the "stratosphere." There, there are no clouds or fog (because it is above the clouds and fog), no lightning or thunderstorms, and no changes in cold or heat (the temperature is always stable, so it is called the stratosphere). Airplanes flying in this high atmospheric layer will travel several times faster than ordinary flights.</p>
<p>Therefore, future aviation will not only be very safe but also very fast. According to the latest record set by French pilot Der Motte, the average speed is 431 kilometers per hour. It is predicted that in the future, it will be possible to fly 1,000 kilometers per hour in the stratosphere!</p>
<p>Ambitious children! Our thoughts should turn to the sky!</p>

<p>— Yang Jiaying</p>
<p>Little silkworms are called treasures, they only eat mulberry leaves and not rice.</p>
<p>The weather is good in spring, and the treasures develop early.</p>
<p>The silkworm girls in the east village are busy, the farmers' wives in the west village are busy, picking mulberry leaves to fill the baskets, filling the baskets with mulberry leaves to feed the silkworms, and the silkworms' bodies are strong.</p>
<p>Spinning silk and making cocoons is a good job, making the farmers laugh heartily.</p>
<p>Once the farming is busy, the silkworm business is over, carrying the cocoons to the neighborhood, exchanging them for gold and silver, buying fish, buying meat, and buying grain, all saying that the silkworms are good.</p>

<p>— Ban Wen</p>
<p>I once wrote an article in this publication about the weapons of fish, describing how fish rely on their unique weapons to defend themselves against other creatures that threaten their lives. At the end, I also asked the children: "What are your weapons?"</p>
<p>Now I tell you: your weapon is "knowledge." At your age, you are all starting to acquire simple "knowledge," because humans need "knowledge" to survive.</p>
<p>The great American philosopher John Dewey once said: "Knowledge is authority," which means that humans have "knowledge" and therefore have the authority to survive. Fish are lower-level creatures, and their weapons rely solely on sharp teeth, spines, tails, etc., which is because they lack "knowledge." Since we humans are higher-level creatures, our weapons should be more civilized and also the most effective.</p>
<p>Dear children, quickly cultivate the seeds of "knowledge," they will sprout and eventually bear fruit. Do not be lazy for a moment and fail to taste the sweetness of the fruit!</p>
<p>Your weapon is "knowledge"!</p>
<p>Children, please remember this sentence I say today.</p>
<h3 id="e252">The World in a Box <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bailu</p>
<p>If you are willing to do as I say, then the box you make will definitely contain the world. The method is as simple as described below.</p>
<p>Tools and Materials: One cigarette box that holds 225 cigarettes, one sheet of white paper, plus a pen and ink.</p>
<p>Instructions: Use the pen to paint the inside of the entire box black with ink. After it dries, paste the white paper in the middle of the box, dividing it into two pairs of rectangles of equal size. Then, use a needle to prick a tiny hole in one end of the box, and use scissors to cut a hole the size of two hairmark in the other end. Then, close the lid (the inside of the lid must also be painted with ink). This box is now complete.</p>
<p>How to Play: Hold the box in your hand, close one eye, and keep the other eye open (if you cannot do this, or if doing this makes your eyes feel very uncomfortable, then you can hold the box with one hand and cover your eye with the other hand). Look through the hole made by the scissors, and the outside world will be reflected on the white paper in your box. People and cars will move, but they will be upside down.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? Children may want to ask me, but here, because of your knowledge and the length of the newspaper, I cannot tell you anything for the time being. Telling you will only confuse you. Fortunately, in the near future, physics will tell you thoroughly and clearly. Regarding this point, I only hope that all the children will study hard.</p>
<h3 id="e253">The Pile of Stones in Our Schoolyard <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Jianping</p>
<p>The pile of stones in our schoolyard has been there for three years now. Now I will write down its origin, please all the children read it quietly.</p>
<p>One day, a third-grade student in Group B in our school was holding a rubber cat in his hand, squeezing it and playing with it, looking very proud.</p>
<p>"This is a foreign product! How can you be so unpatriotic?" As soon as I saw it, I rebuked him like this.</p>
<p>"What does it matter? It's only two cents in total. Even if they take it, they won't get rich, and we won't become poor!" He argued with me very reasonably. I knew from his tone that without factual evidence, I couldn't reason with him. So, I immediately informed all the students that from the next day onwards, when coming to school, each person must pick up a stone on the road and throw it in the designated place in the schoolyard, without forgetting or interrupting. Although they all felt confused, they had to do as instructed.</p>
<p>After a week, the pile of stones was more than three feet high. I pointed to the pile of stones and asked the student who had been playing with the little cat, "Can you still say that two cents doesn't matter now? Look! There are only a little over a hundred people in our school, and the small stones accumulated in a week are already so high. If 400 million Chinese people all give two cents to the Japanese, how much do you think that total would be?" In this way, all the students in the school understood.</p>

<p>(1) The little monkey saw a person walking by in the tree and thought it was good to be human.</p>
<p>(2) So it stole clothes and a hat.</p>
<p>(3) The little monkey dressed up as a person and felt very happy.</p>
<p>(4) It walked up to the cats and dogs, but the cats and dogs still called it a monkey.</p>
<p>(7) The little monkey walked up to the cattle and horses again, and the cattle and horses also shouted: "The monkey is here!"</p>
<p>(6) He was furious and went to tell his mother monkey. The mother monkey said, "Humans know how to do things. You only wear clothes and don't do anything. How can you be called a human?"</p>

<p>Children!</p>
<p>In spring! Everything in the world that has life contains a hint of vitality, and I think you must be happy. But, children! In another corner of this warm spring, our human "health enemy"! Germs are also lurking and preparing to plot against us! These days, in the newspapers, haven't we seen news every day of many children dying from smallpox or fever? Smallpox and fever are two of the most common and dangerous "childhood diseases." Vaccination is the safest and most effective prevention. In the city, the health bureau, and in the townships, the public education center and charitable organizations, are mostly administering vaccinations. Children! Especially those who live in poor and remote areas, where it is impossible to get a good doctor when you are sick! Get vaccinated quickly! Those who have been vaccinated before should get vaccinated again now, and those who have not been vaccinated should get vaccinated quickly now. This little pain of breaking the skin, as light as a mosquito bite, I think you can endure it no matter what.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Swatting Flies <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting warmer, and the flies that people hate the most are gradually appearing. Although flies are very small things, they can transmit epidemics, and countless people lose their lives because of them every year. Therefore, flies are our enemies, and we should exterminate them. The reproduction of flies is extremely fast. Roughly speaking, one fly now will become hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of flies in the future. If we kill one fly now, it is like killing hundreds of thousands, or millions, of flies in the future. Therefore, now is the time for us to swat flies. I hope that after class, children will engage in fly-swatting work, which is very important for hygiene and cleanliness. However, flies cannot be swatted with objects but must be swatted with fly swatters made of green gauze. Furthermore, the dead flies must be burned in the fire, and after swatting, the fly swatter must be hidden well, and you must never touch it with your hands, because fly swatters are very dirty. Children should pay special attention to this point. Also, after swatting flies, you should wash your hands clean before eating anything. Children! Let's all engage in fly-swatting work!</p>

<p>— Xu Chajie</p>
<p>Insects, snakes, crabs...and many other insects, they must molt once every time they grow. When molting, the old epidermis is removed from the root, and a new epidermis is regenerated. When you children see it, you must feel why they are not afraid of pain, and are not afraid of trouble, and must do this. In fact, they have no choice!</p>
<p>The epidermis of insects and snakes contains lime and will only harden, not expand. The inside of the insect's body grows day by day, and the epidermis binds it, making it really uncomfortable, so it sheds the old epidermis and produces another layer of wide epidermis. The molting of insects is really a physiological relationship for them!</p>

<h3 id="e260">Yarn and Cotton Prices Surge, with High-Grade Yarn at 188.4 and Cotton at 47.20; Trading Volume Reaches 133,200 Bales of Yarn and 273,700 Loads of Cotton <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues its bullish run, with prices surging dramatically. This is largely due to pent-up demand being unleashed after a long period of stagnation. News of a severe drought in the United States has pushed up U.S. cotton prices, forcing short sellers to cover their positions at a loss. Market sentiment is extremely volatile. However, yarn sales have slowed down somewhat due to the high prices. Nevertheless, rising cotton prices are fueling the surge in yarn prices.</p>
<p>In pre-market trading, speculative yarn prices rose in response to higher prices for imported cotton. Buying activity was intense, with prices for all months rising by 1.2, 3, or 4 yuan. The afternoon session opened flat, but prices suddenly surged in the second and third rounds of trading, with prices for all months rising by 1.7, 9 jiao, or 2 to 2.3 or 4 yuan. The sentiment among both bulls and bears in the market was uncertain, leading to a significant increase in trading volume. Total trading volume for the day reached 133,200 bales, with sales from Da Ji (1,900 bales), Da Feng (3,500 bales), Zhen Da (1,450 bales), Hui Kang (1,800 bales), Rui Da (2,400 bales), Jun Chang (1,650 bales), Yuan Feng (1,450 bales), Ren Feng (2,300 bales), Da Yi (1,200 bales), Tai Chang (1,300 bales), Chang Feng (4,650 bales), Xie Sheng (2,300 bales), Xin Cheng (1,850 bales), Chang Yu (1,350 bales), Yuan Tai (1,100 bales), and Da Chang (1,450 bales). Buyers included Sen Kang (3,550 bales), Da Yu (3,450 bales), Rui Da (1,600 bales), Chun Ji (2,650 bales), Da Fu (3,300 bales), Ji Feng (2,400 bales), Heng Yi (4,700 bales), Yu Kang (1,850 bales), Sui Long (450 bales), Ming De (4,800 bales), Geng Feng (3,850 bales), Shen Chang (1,750 bales), Yi Cheng (1,100 bales), Yuan Tai (1,300 bales), De Ji (1,600 bales), and Tong Xing (1,800 bales). The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Speculative Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change from Previous Day Number of Accounts</p>
<p>June 183.8 181.7 182.8 Up 3.20 42,750</p>
<p>July 185.6 183.5 185.6 3.10 64,500</p>
<p>August 187.4 184.4 187.4 3.50 55,250</p>
<p>September 188.1 185.3 188.1 3.60 37,450</p>
<p>October 188.4 185.4 188.4 3.40 33,000</p>
<p>November 188.4 186.0 188.4 3.10 8,700</p>
<p>Total 241,600</p>
<p>Spot Yarn: Sales remain good, with trading volume from various groups totaling 1,500 bales. Prices are up 1-2 yuan. Purchases from various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangxi 50, Changsha 2, North Group 150, Guangdong 425, Industry Peers 25, Nanjing 2, Fujian 5, Inland 420, Anqing 125, Tianjin 175, Shantou 5</p>
<p>The cotton market is tightening, and the price surge is intensifying. This is driven by rising U.S. cotton prices amid a severe drought in the United States. This has fueled market sentiment, and bull traders are becoming increasingly assertive. As a result, the market has seen a frenzy of price increases. The momentum behind new cotton prices remains strong. However, the recent price increases have been too rapid.</p>
<p>In pre-market trading, speculative cotton prices rose in line with higher imported cotton prices. The second and third rounds of trading were flat, but prices suddenly rose at the close as bulls aggressively bought in. Prices for all months rose by 7-8 jiao, with new cotton up 1.3 yuan.

<p>A telegram from New York on June 1st reported on the cotton market for the week, stating that the cotton market was very quiet last week, with prices fluctuating. Industry peers are awaiting developments in Washington. At the same time, there is a conflicting sentiment, because on the one hand, the new cotton is good and the demand for cotton is not good, but on the other hand, the supply in the South is small and there are often changes in the new cotton during the summer. Trading volume is extremely thin, with few bulls closing positions and few speculative sales. The threat of boll weevils is indeed developing in the southwestern cotton region, but there have been no reports in the eastern region. However, the extent of the damage is not yet significant. Planting is 95% complete, and 85% of the crop is developing well. Agricultural authorities announced that the tax under the Peng Hai-min proposal will be based on a price of 1 jiao, 1 fen, and 3 li and 4 hao, which means that excess production will be taxed 5 fen, 6 li, and 7 hao per pound.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Financial Silver Party Plots to Abolish Silver Tax, Spot Gold Falls Slightly by 2.40 Yuan – Market Situation Stable then Weak in the Morning Session – <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was slightly volatile due to rumors that the pro-silver faction in the U.S. Senate was moving to abolish the 50% tax on silver transaction profits proposed by the President. However, this did not have a significant impact. Although prices fell, the market situation remained stable in the morning session. At the beginning of the day, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the U.S. declined, with forward silver prices on the Gold Exchange falling by 1 to 2 li. Exchange rates did not fluctuate much. London spot gold rose by 2 pence, U.S. cotton rose by 27 points, and U.S. wheat declined slightly. An Associated Press dispatch stated that pro-silver senators Thomas, Wheeler, and Borah were planning a meeting to discuss abolishing the 50% tax on silver profits. Initial off-market trading showed a slight decline, which then stabilized. After the market opened, prices trended downward. HSBC's listed prices for both UK and U.S. currency were flat and then declined further, but market sentiment remained relatively stable with much fluctuation. A Reuters dispatch stated that the U.S. would announce the issuance of new bonds worth $1,000,000,000 next Monday. The overall trend remained low. After entering the market, domestic prices stabilized, but trading was light, causing the market to fluctuate without much change. Near noon, major players showed strong buying interest, with demand exceeding supply, leading to repeated rebounds. However, many were willing to sell at higher prices. The market closed lower. There were rumors in the market that silver prices would rise in the night session, primarily due to profit-taking on the eve of Sunday. Overall, the fluctuations were narrow, and trading was quite ordinary. The price of pure gold was 1039.3 yuan. The market situation for the morning session is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 1029.3 yuan, a slight increase of 1 jiao compared to the previous closing price. Goods opened at the same price. The morning opening exchange rates were 1 shilling and 3 and 4375/10000 pence for British currency and 32.5 yuan for U.S. currency. Domestic prices hardened. Hengyu, Yongde, Yuqingyong, etc., sold at 7 yuan. Hengyu, Tongchun, Qianchangxiang, and Jin Tiao returned to 8 yuan. It was anticipated that HSBC's listed prices for both UK and U.S. currency would be flat and still decline. Hongli, Daxing, and Yong sold at 6.8 yuan. Dadecheng, Xincheng, and Changlai entered the market. Shanghai's July U.S. dollar rose from 75 to 7.7 yuan. After entering the market, the situation fluctuated. A Reuters dispatch reported that the U.S. would issue new public bonds, causing prices to fall to 6.3 yuan. However, market sentiment remained stable, and prices rebounded when low. For a long time after that, prices fluctuated around 7 yuan. Zhengjin took delivery of September U.S. dollars at 9375 and then rose to 7.3 yuan. Dadecheng, Yuqingyong, Fuxingyong, and Gong Tiao fell again to 6.4 yuan. Hengyu, Yifengyong, and Tongchun accepted Tiao and rebounded. Yukang bought aggressively, rising again to 7.9 yuan. Dafayong, Hengtaiqing, Yufu Xingyong bought, further rising from 7.3 yuan to 8.4 yuan. Hengyu sold Tiao, retreating to within 8 yuan. Yuanmao, Qiudingkang, and Youjin rose again to 8.3 yuan. Ruikang seized the opportunity to supply Tiao at high prices, causing prices to fall. The morning closing price retreated to 1026.8 yuan, with strong downward pressure. Goods were only auctioned at 5.5 yuan. After the market closed, goods from Hengtai, Hengyu, etc., were supplied, causing prices to fall further. Xianghe also sold, retreating to within 5 yuan. There were rumors of rising silver prices in the night session. The highest price during the morning session was 1029.3 yuan, and the lowest price was 1026.3 yuan, a fluctuation of 3 yuan. The result was a slight decrease of 2.4 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price remained at 32.375 yuan due to no change in HSBC's U.S. dollar listing, resulting in a spot gold price of over 1068 yuan. Based on the closing price, the approximate downward pressure was 42 yuan, which was more than 2 yuan stronger than the previous close. The registered price for June was 1027 yuan, and for July, it was also 1027 yuan. Morning supplementary water was 1027 yuan. The price of pure gold was 1039.3 yuan, approximately a premium of 10 yuan. Refined gold remained sluggish. Within the market, 400 taels were sold by the Tianjin gang to Yingfengheng at a premium of 11.5 yuan. There were few other transactions, indicating that buyers were content. Although there were rumors of the Central Bank opening for cash transactions, this could not be confirmed. Swap transactions still involved short positions paying 8 jiao. Public orders were opened, forcing long positions to compromise. As of today, there were 420 June Tiao remaining, held by seven long position holders: Tongfengheng, Qianchangxiang, Yuanheng, Fuxingyong, Runchangyong, Hengyu, and Dadecheng. There were three short position holders: Ying, Heng, and Dafengheng Yongfeng.</p>
<p>Market trading was mediocre. In summary, Wanxingshunli, Hengyu, Dakang, Ruikang, Yuanmao, Fuchang, Daxingcheng, and Fuyuqingyong were primarily sellers. Tongchun, Hengtai, Dafengheng, Qingyu, Dafayong, Yuanchun, Yuanmao, Yongfuxingyong, Xinchang, and Yukang were primarily buyers. Fuchang, Huixiang, Xianghe, and Hengtai were initially buyers and then sellers. Yifengyong was initially a seller and then a buyer. The Dalian gang, through Wanxing, traded over 600 Tiao, offsetting over 100 Tiao. Shunli traded over 400, offsetting over 100 Tiao. The Guangdong gang, Shengda, had little activity, and neither did Hengxing. The total number of transactions for the day was 24,367 Tiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Huashang Securities Exchange market was quite calm. Market prices fluctuated up and down, trending towards sideways movement. There was selling when prices rose slightly and buying when prices fell slightly. Most people were bearish, resulting in too many short positions. Therefore, there was a phenomenon of buying when prices fell slightly. Spot prices were low, and forward prices were high. Arbitrage trading was common, resulting in selling when prices rose slightly. The environment was chaotic with no real signs to go on. The overall market situation fluctuated irregularly with market sentiment. The future is unlikely to unfold easily soon. Yesterday's events were completely chaotic. The morning session showed mixed gains and losses, about 2 to 3 jiao. The afternoon session continued to trend downward. After entering the market, consolidated salt tax gradually trended firm, generally increasing by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan. The afternoon opening saw a return to chaos, with mixed gains and losses and even smaller fluctuations, fluctuating between 2 and 2 jiao. The closing saw slight tension, with a unanimous rebound of about 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. Throughout the day, the spot gold trend was the best, increasing by 0.2 to 0.25 yuan.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (the 1st) the New York Stock Exchange market was almost stagnant all day due to a lack of stimulating news. In the end, many wheat bulls rushed to liquidate their profits, creating a surge in selling, and wheat prices fell sharply. Stock prices were also active, falling drastically by more than 3 yuan. However, the wheat-growing regions remain dry. The minor exchange saw mixed results with a slight decrease. Bonds were also weak, but Argentine public bonds rose again. Cotton rose by more than 1.5 yuan, as news indicated that Congress was likely to pass the Smith Act, authorizing the government to purchase 150 million yuan worth of cotton for relief. If so, then each yarn factory will be busy with work in the summer, and labor unrest may be eliminated. The (securities) market remains stagnant, continuing to trend downward. (Wheat) The public continues to enter, and bulls are liquidating their profits. The public will re-enter when prices fall. The drought has not decreased, and market declines will elicit support from all sides. The weather in the wheat-growing regions has not changed, remaining hot and dry. The market situation may experience a reaction due to rain and excessive buying. However, according to many opinions, the ultimate price level will be high. (Cotton) Prices rose due to extreme heat in several western areas, the possibility of the drought spreading, and poor harvests in Soviet Russia. The above all indicate the market's reactive trends rather than significant developments. Field crops are progressing smoothly, and no rain in June will benefit most cotton crops. Factory purchases totaled 195,000 bales this week. The spot market is stagnant, and cloth is quiet. (Rubber) Prices rose due to firmness in major markets, buying by industry peers, and news of restrictions on the number of exports from Batavia. (Silver) The market remains dull.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices in each month showed a trend of first falling and then rising. The reported prices for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada had fallen back by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Therefore, market sentiment inside and outside the industry was initially weak when prices opened, falling by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Subsequently, the market rebounded as major outside speculators continued to aggressively buy. This surge by the bulls was entirely due to the poor wheat conditions in the United States and the drought, which simultaneously affected international sentiment. Although the domestic new wheat harvest was abundant and there was selling by actual sales brokers, this could not contain the frenzied price increases. At the afternoon opening, near and forward month trading remained unusually active. It was rumored that Tianjin and small factories were selling, while the Yingkou gang and major local speculators were aggressively buying at each price increase. As most businesses were concentrated in the forward months, the price increases were also bold. The total volume of transactions in the morning and afternoon reached 1.2 to 1.3 million bags, the highest this year. The frenzy of market sentiment was unprecedented since the price declines. As a result, the price in the current month increased by 0.175 yuan, July by 0.15 yuan, August by 0.225 yuan, September by 0.3 yuan, October by 0.475 yuan, and November by 0.35 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Fluctuations in Forward Wheat Prices <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat market was generally calm after the opening in the morning. Foreign wheat prices in Chicago and Canada fell back slightly by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Therefore, market sentiment was mostly cautious, with limited buying and selling. Industry observers had conflicting views, and the wheat harvest was imminent, so the situation was not entirely the same as in the flour market. By the afternoon opening, market sentiment had become frenzied. The morning flour market had been exceptionally good, and prices continued to rise in the afternoon. As a result, prices opened 0.3 to 0.6 yuan higher than the morning. Subsequently, prices fell back as long-term bulls sold and inland brokers dumped their holdings. Industry observers believed that a week from now all new wheat would be on the market, and if sales did not pick up, the future would not be good. As a result, the price in July rose by 0.1 yuan, August and September by 0.2 yuan, and October by 0.3 yuan. Due to inactivity from factories, spot wheat had no market, and old goods were unsalable.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Weak Sales of Ke Xian Rice Stabilize <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>The Ke Xian rice market saw continued arrivals of goods that had been previously shipped from other locations. However, the quantity had decreased, and sellers were less anxious to sell. Some customers saw increased activity in another province and were unwilling to lower prices. However, the other merchants were still loading their previous orders, and no shipping space was available for new orders, so sales actually decreased. Other merchants were waiting and watching, and trading suddenly became quiet. A total of 843 bags of processed and unmilled rice were traded by Fujian merchants, with varying prices, mostly similar to the previous market. However, because the street committee had recommended a rice merchant as the leader of the industry, the rice market in Hexia had been closed for one day. As a result, nearly 1,000 bags of processed and yuan rice were purchased from this street, and the market began to stabilize.</p>
<h3 id="e275">New Jiujiang Rapeseed Opens at 3.8 Yuan <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the only new goods arriving were a batch of 99 bags of new Jiujiang rapeseed. The quality was medium, with excessive amounts of mud and fine ash, rated between 87 and 80. The price opened at 3.8 yuan. Over 400 bags of Wenzhou goods arrived but were not traded. New broad beans have been harvested in various locations. If the weather remains clear, they will be shipped here next week in succession. Yesterday, merchants purchased 13,800 bags of various soybeans, and telegrams reported rising prices, so sentiment was tight. However, there was little change in prices. The entire market traded one truckload of Zhengyangguan beans and two truckloads of Feihe beans, which were purchased by merchants. Two truckloads of Yingzhou beans were opened, and the factory purchased them.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Silk and Tea Russian Firms Start Trading in Qi Ning Black Tea <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market of this port, Russian firms and the Cooperation Association Foreign Firm have begun trading in black tea from Qimen and Ningzhou. British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Cooper, and Tianyu have also taken the opportunity to replenish their stocks. As a result, the price of black tea, which had been declining, has stabilized. According to tea merchants, the sales of Russian black tea seem to be as large as in previous years. The reason is that the prices of Indian and Ceylonese tea are high, Russian goods imported to China have increased sharply, and there have been financial and credit issues. Since the violent price drop the day before yesterday, the green tea market has also seen quite active trading.</p>
<h3 id="e277">New Silkworm Cocoon Prices in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Difficult to Increase <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Farmers in Pingyao Suffer Losses Farmers in the Pingyao area suffered damage from the weather to their early native silkworms and are now raising improved late silkworms. Hatching is delayed, and the silkworms eat more leaves. Although the late silkworm harvest is more abundant, the cocoons are also superior to the early native silkworm cocoons, but the cocoon costs are not low. The cocoon markets have been open for many days, but cocoon prices have been restricted by public discussion and cannot be freely traded. Improved silkworm cocoons are only 25 to 26 yuan, and native silkworm cocoons are 15 to 16 yuan. Prices on the Sima scale are only 31 to 32 yuan and 18 to 19 yuan, respectively. Farmers are suffering heavy losses.</p>
<p>Many Silk Reels in Xiashi Xiashi has always been a famous silk-producing area. This year, farmers have raised a strong number of silkworms and have had good harvests. However, there are too many silkworms and too few leaves, and leaf prices have been very high, reaching 2.5 to 2.6 yuan. Farmers' silkworm costs have been over 40 yuan. The cocoon markets are opening and offering only 30 yuan for superior improved silkworm cocoons and 20 yuan for native silkworm cocoons. Each load of fresh cocoons must be sold at a loss of over 10 yuan, so they are all reeling their own silk.</p>
<p>Haiyan New Cocoon Prices Opening Kanghai peasants of the four villages raised sericulture this spring, lost considerable native species in transit, and improved breeds performed quite well. New cocoons have come onto the market, and are about 80% full. Few cocoon markets have opened, and cocoon prices are low. Improved cocoon market price is only 25 to 26 yuan city scale, land species is 14 or 15 yuan. Farmers are difficult to earn a profit, and even leaf costs are not covered.</p>
<p>Henglin Cocoon Market Opening Soon The Donghenglin improved silkworm area of this state is where farmers are largely raising improved species this year, where guidance has been effective, and achievements have been excellent. Early silk worms may soon be down from the raised platforms, and a bountiful harvest is to be expected. Gonghe Yong, and other cocoon operations are expected to start their openings gradually as of tomorrow, prices for cocoons will be publicly negotiated, improved cocoons will be at a maximum of 25 or 26 yuan, native varieties will be at 15 yuan, by city scale.</p>
<p>Shuang Gong Silk India Demand Not Weak The India need for Shuang Gong silk is still abundant, Fulan Heng Shuang Gong silk factory is actively processing to reel old cocoons with newly arriving domestic cocoons. Shuang Gong silk is therefore more easily exported, and over the latter half of the month, 158 bales shipped to England, transferred onward to India.</p>

<p>Spot Tin is unmoving because the avenue for sales is dead, there's little activity in the market, and prices aren't high. Malaysian grades open at 191 or 192 yuan, Dutch grades at 215 or 216 yuan, and Thai grades at 200 yuan. Transactions are occasional, with few purchases. Exports and large volume business face a situation of loitering and not improving.</p>

<h3 id="e279">Advocating for Pregnant Working Women <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>Forcing pregnant women who are seven or eight months along to continue laborious work as usual is something that should not happen in a civilized, organized human society. However, like other forms of encroachment, exploitation, and oppression – various things that should not exist – this still persists in current society.</p>
<p>If a married woman abandons her family responsibilities and the nurturing of her children to seek meager income in various institutions and factories, then there is undoubtedly a ravenous wolf of survival chasing her. This forces her to risk suffering and danger for a monthly wage of three, five, or a little over ten yuan. Even when her belly is large, she must still stagger into and out of the work gates. It is not because she is inherently greedy, but because that ravenous wolf will not ease up on her even as she nears delivery.</p>
<p>Although precise statistics are currently unavailable, the number of miscarriages, difficult births, or deaths caused by excessive work among pregnant working women is undoubtedly shockingly large. Where does one even begin to address this?</p>
<p>Some more enlightened institutions give female teachers and female staff of higher professional status one month of pre- and postnatal leave with regular pay. However, female factory workers and domestic servants of lower status not only do not receive such preferential treatment, but they also worry about losing their jobs to others during the few days of unpaid rest after giving birth.</p>
<p>The work of domestic servants is sometimes light and sometimes heavy, with varying degrees of intermittency. The most unbearable is the work of female factory workers, who are not allowed a single second of rest within fixed working hours. A pregnant woman in this situation is in a worse position than in hell. What have they done to wrong the factory owners on a daily basis? Among female workers in mechanized industries, the work rate of female workers is not weaker than that of male workers, yet the difference in wages often reaches a factor of one. Most female factory workers are currently unmarried. How many women in a factory become pregnant each year? Using the profits from their usual wages to subsidize a few pregnant women so that they can rest before and after childbirth is only natural.</p>
<p>People in our country are always talking about propriety, justice, and the ethical order. In fact, those who adhere to ritual teachings are the least moral. Customarily, there are the so-called four taboos: first, moving west of a dwelling is taboo; second, it's taboo to see a woman breastfeeding; fourth, it’s taboo to hold a child born in the first or fifth lunar month. Even in today’s feudal society, scholars still do not step into the bedroom of a woman in childbirth, even when his own wife is on the verge of death. Women giving birth to children is inherently sacred work beneficial to humanity, yet scholars and officials regard it as ominous and taboo it. How much they despise women's flesh and blood! How much they belittle their own origins!</p>
<p>Due to the traditional contempt for women's childbirth, coupled with cruel exploitation, the issue of pregnant women still working desperately as usual when nearing delivery has become a non-issue.</p>
<p>Turning all problematic things into non-issues is inherently easy; all one needs to do is close one's eyes and one will not see black and white. However, if this happens, everyone will become blind. This is not only the misfortune of pregnant working women; what about the culture of the Chinese nation? What about the survival of the Chinese nation?</p>
<p>The issue of paid rest for pregnant working women before and after childbirth is a small piece of many issues, and it does not affect major events in all aspects. As long as everyone does not completely ignore it, as long as at least some humanitarianism exists in people's hearts, it is hoped that society can enthusiastically promote and agitate for it so that it can be implemented universally as soon as possible!</p>
<h3 id="e280">Examining with Mr. Chen Da the Urgent Need for Birth Control in China <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>The May 4th issue of the Ta Kung Pao published an article by Professor Chen Da of Tsinghua University, titled "The Need for Birth Control in China," which he delivered as a speech at the Rotary Club in Beiping. Because of Mr. Chen's reputation and the startling nature of the topic, it drew my special attention. However, after reading the speech, I felt compelled to speak out. Everyone knows that the entire China has fallen into the tragic state of poverty, ignorance, disease, and death, under the combined attack of natural disasters and human calamities. However, the reason for this is not overpopulation, but poor governance and a deteriorating environment. Mr. Chen does not grasp the core of the problem, abandoning the fundamental to pursue the superficial, saying: "To prevent disasters before they happen, there is an urgent need to control births, thereby reducing suffering and improving the nation." Mr. Chen made this grand pronouncement because he was shocked by the report of the relief association, which stated that "there are 60 million disaster victims in fourteen provinces of China." Here, based on the records of the Ta Kung Pao, I will discuss and examine Mr. Chen's points as follows:</p>
<p>Reducing Mortality</p>
<p>We believe that what is causing the current terrible mortality rate in China is not overpopulation or excessive births. However, Mr. Chen says: "If we can reach the level of the Irish birth rate, then the number of births each year can be reduced to seven million, and the number of deaths each year can be reduced from twelve million to five million." Even if we disregard whether the health administration and public intelligence of Ireland are compatible with China, the fact is that before domestic and foreign troubles are eliminated, natural disasters will not be reduced by human effort, and the deaths of the people will only increase, not decrease. If most people listen to Mr. Chen's theory, on the one hand, the birth rate will be greatly reduced, and on the other hand, the population will still be rapidly dying. Will the Chinese nation not be completely eliminated? Since ancient times, there have only been countries that perished due to population decline, and there has never been an example of a country perishing due to population increase.</p>
<p>Children's Education</p>
<p>Mr. Chen said: "In 1925, the percentage of children enrolled in school in England was about 93% of the school-age children, while in China, according to the Ministry of Education's report, the proportion was only 9%. If we want to improve the quality of the population, we naturally need to reduce births." Can reducing births really improve the quality of the population? We know that the development of education is the responsibility of the government. The government collects large amounts of educational taxes from the people every year to establish schools. In this reality of widespread illiteracy, we can only passively urge the government to quickly improve the current education system to seek opportunities for everyone to receive education. Mr. Chen's intention seems to be to forcefully cut the number of existing and future children to 9%, allowing this small number of people to enjoy educational opportunities. Isn't this "cutting the feet to fit the shoes"? Look at India and Annam, where the population is decreasing day by day, but their culture is not increasing with each passing day. I do not want to use a subjugated nation as a metaphor, but I use this to prove that education relies entirely on political power to promote it.</p>
<p>Raising Living Standards</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's main idea is that "Chinese workers have too little income and cannot afford the cost of children's education. Reducing births will improve their living standards." Leaving aside whether the method is correct, let's talk about the facts. Now, the average worker only has sexual impulses and doesn't have sexual knowledge, and "sex" can be said to be the "only joyful enjoyment" of laborers. Therefore, not only is artificial control and regulation impossible, it is simply impossible. We can only treat Mr. Chen's theory as empty talk. There are special ways to improve workers' lives.</p>
<p>Improving the Environment</p>
<p>"Our nation lives and breathes in this difficult and distressing social environment, and maintaining life is already not easy... What use is it to insist on increasing births? Why don't we use birth control to improve the Chinese social environment?" This is the main idea of the fourth paragraph of the speech. It is a fact that the general people of China are in a difficult and distressing environment, but it is also a one-sided view to control births to improve the environment. Whether the social environment is good or bad depends entirely on the economic conditions at the time. Most people are busy year-round earning a living, or are unemployed and waiting to die. Even if they can control births, where do they have the time and ability to engage in "cultural," "academic," or "career" advancement? Moreover, as I said earlier, it is very difficult for people who are exhausted from labor to practice birth control!</p>
<p>National Health</p>
<p>"The health of children depends on the health of the mother. According to medical judgment, after a woman has given birth once, it takes at least three years to recover her health. Therefore, she should have another child at least every three years or more." On this point, I do not have deep medical knowledge and dare not make reckless judgments. However, facts and common sense tell me that it does not seem to require that long of a time. Even if we implement birth control according to Mr. Chen's judgment, but the country's sanitary facilities are like this, and human affairs are like that, even if Chinese children can bring a healthy physique from birth, I am afraid that not all of them will grow up healthy!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's speech is entirely based on his own living environment. He is a preacher of determinism and can also be said to be a follower of Malthus. However, Malthus's "Principle of Population" has been criticized by informed people as "shallow and in the tone of a monk," and Professor Chen seems to admire Malthus very much. I dare not belittle Mr. Chen here. In the past, even Da Vinci and other scholars were often fooled by Malthus. In short, we firmly believe that if China does not overthrow imperialism and eradicate feudal forces, even if the population is reduced to the birth rate of Ireland, or even less, the result will only accelerate China's demise. As for birth control for people with venereal diseases, certain infectious diseases, or frailty, it should of course be practiced. These people should not only be made to abstain from sex but should also have their libido surgically removed. In addition, birth control for personal career or academic pursuits is a common phenomenon in civilized society. However, this cannot be regarded as a "national policy." Before humanity has invented other methods of reproduction, birth control can only be regarded as an individualistic and reluctant behavior. Why is there a need to loudly advocate it? What does Mr. Chen think?</p>
<p>Fish Language Understanding</p>
<p>Nursing my body covered in wounds, I am lost in thought: For the sake of a watery mirage, mistaking it for the gates of the Crystal Palace, I kept chasing, kept searching, and unconsciously entered the nets set by people. When I realized it, in order to win back my original freedom, I struggled several times, which is why I am now covered in wounds. But even so, I have strengthened my heart. As long as I can pierce this net and swim freely, I would gladly try even if it means my body is shattered to pieces. My companions in the net! Do not be sad or resentful anymore. Do not feel sorry. As long as you unite your strength and move forward! In the same direction!</p>

<p>— Hua</p>
<p>VII Owen (continued)</p>
<p>Regarding Owen's ideal society of gender equality, we briefly discussed it last time. Now let us describe his sharp criticism of modern marriage and family. Owen believes that compulsory marriage is the cause of family misfortune. In this kind of misfortune, women suffer particularly severely, and children morally degenerate as a result. He believes that prostitution is a result of hypocritical "church" marriages. Owen once said:</p>
<p>"Mankind has been a slave to the three major evils of today - private property, blind religious systems, and marriage based on the former two. The ever-increasing pursuit of wealth and the resulting marriage are gradually moving us further and further away from our nature and causing us to reach a state of decline physically and mentally. ... Modern marriage is merely a sinister fabrication of the clergy to make the people dependent on the unnatural laws of the state and the church. This union made by the clergy only gives the rich the opportunity to unite with the rich. In all modern societies, even merchants are no exception, there is no such hypocrisy and deception in this relationship between husband and wife.</p>
<p>They are all saying that women's chastity can only be guaranteed by the statutory slavery determined in marriage. But it can be said with great confidence that women's chastity can only be guaranteed after the current form of marriage is eliminated. At that time, could prostitution still be so prevalent as it is today?"</p>
<p>In Europe more than a hundred years ago, marriage was entirely controlled and dominated by the clergy. The wedding ceremony had to be held in a church, the harm of which was no less than the old Chinese saying, "the command of parents and the words of a matchmaker." Therefore, Owen had such a profound and sharp criticism. Secondly, Owen criticized modern families as follows:</p>
<p>"The family develops a selfish emotion in the hearts of children, teaching children to regard their own family as a small world, in which they repeat, 'My house, my wife, my property, my children, my husband...'</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to advocating a fundamental change in the modern social organization, Owen asserted that it was necessary to improve family relations. He speculated that only a full public life can break the selfish and closed life of the current family system. He said:</p>
<p>"The residents of the new world must live together and eat in public dining halls; eliminate individual houses and replace them with large public dormitories; neither individuals nor families can have private property; everyone is a member of the community; everyone shares the public wealth - the fruits of public labor, regardless of status. At that time, women will enjoy the same rights as men, so their status will naturally be completely independent. Children belong to the commune, not the parents. As a result of the complete elimination of useless occupations and wasteful extravagance, the productive forces will increase greatly, and the social wealth will increase sharply. At that time, all considerations that restrict births will be unnecessary. Of course, at that time, society will pay attention to the appropriate combination of the two sexes in order to prevent the transmission of diseases to children or the proliferation of inferior races."</p>
<p>Owen vigorously advocated public education for children. His proposed method was: "Children must enter school from the age of three, eat in public dining halls, and live in public dormitories; but parents can visit and talk at any time. In school, children must acquire all necessary and beneficial knowledge; at that time, we must try our best to prevent children from acquiring various bad habits from their parents or by other means; at the same time, we must give children hints of good habits and hobbies, so that they tend towards a happy life and become useful members of society." Finally, Owen said about the future occupation of women: "In the future, the first occupation of women is to take care of children and their own homes; the second is to cultivate gardens and plant vegetables needed for public dining halls; the third is to undertake textile work suitable for women; the fourth is to make clothes for staff; and the fifth is to take turns working in public dining halls and public dormitories. At that time, women themselves will be well-educated, and they can also supervise some parts of children's education in schools."</p>
<p>However, Owen, like other utopian socialists (such as Fourier), flew high in the clouds of pure theory, simply describing his ideals, without building a bridge to the hell on earth, and without considering the realistic state of society and its dynamics. In other words, he did not indicate how to cross from the hell on earth to the paradise. Therefore, Owen's demands and teachings are not suitable as slogans for mobilizing the masses to fight for the cause of women's liberation.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Commemorating Lu Yin <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>The "May Fourth" angry tide once surged up many beautiful and bright waves. Lu Yin, needless to say, was one of those waves, but she did not follow the tide and flow thousands of miles, but stagnated in a bay of water!</p>
<p>Really, a long time ago, I already had such a feeling: "Our writer - Lu Yin, is a little old!"</p>
<p>However, in today's reversal of the tide of "women returning to the family" and "good wife and loving mother doctrine," Lu Yin suddenly died! Alas! In the atmosphere of "not allowing women to be human," we have once again lost such a woman who "strives to be human"! It is too infuriating! The more I think about it, the more I admire and mourn Lu Yin! So when Factory Hidden was put into a coffin, I ran to attend her funeral.</p>
<p>The funeral was Christian. After everyone silently offered their tears, in the atmosphere of hymns of praise to God, Bible readings and prayers, and the pastor's sermon, her - Lu Yin's relatives and friends, said that the ritual was Lu Yin's will; how she had religious feelings and conformed to the words and deeds of religious figures; and her virtue in dealing with people; she was simply a typical good wife and loving mother with religious beliefs - although at that time, a reader of Lu Yin was dissatisfied with this distortion of Lu Yin, and stood up to point out Lu Yin's "anti-patriarchal" and "anti-feudal" spirit of "striving to be human," and that the will was a kind of "persistence in life" and not a religious belief! But I still can't help but appeal for our writer again!</p>
<p>Anyone who knows Lu Yin's life knows that she did receive religious education and was baptized when she was a child, but she rebelled against religion when she reached middle school! During the "May Fourth" era, she was one of the most famous leaders of the Beijing Student Union! Her words and deeds, her works, all fully demonstrated her spirit of opposing the old society and opposing the old ideas - the old etiquette! Take her love story, for example, it was also very bold and thorough - after Guo Mengliang died, she ran to Guo's house to commit suicide for love and spent more than a year, and finally escaped the constraints of the large family and fell in love with "little lover"! So although she did not move forward with the times, at least she took off the coat of a slave and had the will to be a human being!</p>
<p>Let us try to find her thoughts in her posthumous works: there is no need to turn them far away, just take the two articles that everyone sees now: In the article "Dream," she wrote at the end: "Lu Yina is holding a steel axe and hacking at the thorns. The sharp thorns hurt her fingers and toes, and drops of blood stained her skirt red; but she has vaguely seen the distant path shining, so she no longer cares about the arrogance of the god of fate, she only takes a belief in finding a way out and goes forward."</p>
<p>There is also such a passage in "The Tears of a Girl": "Yes, you are very sympathetic, this is the greatest emotion of mankind, but you are really too childish, this is a fact, do you want to solve it with your tears? Children, maybe you are right, you want to wash away the sins of the world with warm tears of sympathy, ... but the truth of this world has long been conquered by all the evil forces, therefore, it is useless to cry for her." From this, it can be seen that although she has not made much progress, she has never retreated! She only cared about straightening her spine and raising her head to be a human being during her lifetime.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Theft <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ming</p>
<p>One morning, a theft was discovered in the dormitory.</p>
<p>The victims were several ladies living on the second floor. Some of them had lost their parents, and some even had no siblings and were in charge of their families. Therefore, in addition to more than a hundred yuan, some important items were also lost this time.</p>
<p>Theft has a short history here. It is said that similar things happened last year, and the thief was actually a lady with a high status. Unfortunately, she was discovered, and the school authorities had to quietly notify her parents. Then, she was taken away silently, without any sound.</p>
<p>But this time it was a bit different, perhaps because the matter was serious? The news spread quickly, and it quickly entered everyone's ears, so everyone held fresh, curious feelings and looked forward to a fresh result. Piles of flies also buzzed: the fat dormitory supervisor shook her whole body of Ling flesh and walked busily. She threw a smile at every female student who came to greet her, followed by the same sentence:</p>
<p>"I'm going to check your rooms today, oh!" Her voice seemed to contain infinite apologies, and at the same time, she seemed to be hinting that the thief should quickly hide the things to avoid being searched by her. Following the announcement of the search and the temporary ban on students leaving the dormitory, the search did not begin until darkness ruled the earth. Naturally, the nanny's room had been searched, and every seam of every piece of clothing and every corner of every quilt was not easily let go, but still no evidence could be found. At this time, no one knew who was stealing and who was not, only the suspected nanny and "she" knew.</p>
<p>The thief was obviously not a man. Although female students can go out very freely at any time; can be held by their boyfriends and spin to the music of "Goodnight, Vienna" all night, the internal ban is very strict, and even a male dog is not allowed to pass by on weekdays.</p>
<p>Finally, the detective came, and everyone seemed to feel more interested. Curiosity was in everyone's chest, as if someone had thrown a stone into still water, and the round ripples were expanding on the lake surface. At that time, I, like the rest of the people, was in that mood and went into the room. I saw the detective carefully examining the box that had been dug out with a knife, and then said to the nanny next to him, "Bring your keys!" The nanny brought the keys from her own room. The detective then picked out one from the bunch, inserted it into the lock, and turned it. The lock opened with a bang.</p>
<p>"What else do you have to say? The money proves that you stole it!" The detective showed a smug grin and said to the stunned nanny.</p>
<p>"Sir, I didn't steal it..." Before she finished speaking, the detective waved the key in front of her face and then said:</p>
<p>"Didn't steal it? What is this?"</p>
<p>"Sir, I really didn't steal it. The keys happen to be the same. If I stole it, why didn't I throw it away earlier? Since I have a key to open it, why use force to dig it?"</p>
<p>"That's a trap you set, who knows? In short, you are the only poor person here; people do bad things when they are poor... Could it be that the ladies here would steal? They eat well and dress well, have a lot of their own money, and still want other people's money? Only poor people are willing to risk their lives for money!" "Don't say that, sir! Although I am poor, my heart is very pure." Poor people do not necessarily do bad things; there are many bad things that poor people cannot do!</p>
<p>"Stole the money and still talking back?" I don't know why the detective became ashamed and angry. "You must have stolen the money! ... Okay, I'll give you three days to hand over the things, otherwise, I won't be polite and you'll have to come to the line with me!"</p>
<p>"I really didn't steal it," the nanny still insisted, "It's no use forcing me to go to jail and suffer. Anyway, I only have an old life to risk... I'm pitiful and lonely..." After hearing about the jail sentence three days later, a sense of tragic life that had been covered by excessive labor for a long time now jumped into her heart: old tears could not help but roll down like broken beads.</p>
<p>This scene tore my mind, I covered my face and escaped from the crowd; the nanny's tears fell on my heart like frying oil. Yes, she was right. There are many bad things in the world that poor people cannot do; and there are many vicious hearts that are rare among poor people! The nanny herself is an example. She knows that she did not steal, and she usually serves the ladies faithfully like cattle and horses, but as a result, she has become someone else's scapegoat. Maybe she is a scapegoat for a wealthy lady who is being served by her!</p>
<p>Imagining what she would be like three days later; imagining the scene of her being whipped when she had nothing to confess, I seemed to clearly hear her miserable cry. I couldn't help but cover my ears, but the sound seemed to be expanding towards me, becoming many tragic cries..."</p>

<h3 id="e285">The So-Called Hirota's New Policy Toward China <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Han Ying</p>
<p>Bearing Hirota's new instructions, Japanese Minister to China, Ariyoshi, is about to leave Tokyo to return to his post. It is said that Ariyoshi's visit will be to earnestly entice us to directly resolve various pending issues, using the slogan of "coexistence and co-prosperity" to urge our economic cooperation with the Japanese puppet regime. It seems that the Sino-Japanese issue is about to enter a new phase. According to reports, Foreign Minister Hirota's recent policy toward China contains six points. Let us now list them and refute them one by one:</p>
<p>(1) Due to the April 17th statement, the Chinese side's feelings toward Japan have changed again, misunderstanding that Japan intends to invade China. After the minister returns to his post, he should explain that Japan's true intention is to maintain peace in the Far East and seek coexistence and co-prosperity between China and Japan, and urge the Chinese side to understand this policy.</p>
<p>Japan's April 17th statement has exposed its entire conspiracy against China, and its ambition to dominate East Asia has long been seen through by the world. Now Hirota claims that the true intention of the statement is to maintain peace in the Far East and seek coexistence and co-prosperity between China and Japan, urging our country to understand this policy. Isn't this a self-deceiving statement! May I ask how to maintain peace in the Far East? How to interpret coexistence and co-prosperity? If forcing other countries under one's own control is called maintaining peace in the Far East, and seizing other countries' lands as one's own is called coexistence and co-prosperity, then we really dare not accept it!</p>
<p>(2) Japan wants China to understand that Japan and "Manchukuo" jointly bear the responsibility for peace in East Asia. If China awakens and accepts Japan's sincerity, Japan will spare no effort to assist in the prosperity and unification of friendly China.</p>
<p>We have not been able to understand Japan's sincerity to this day, nor dare to accept it! We only feel that the responsibility for the lack of peace in East Asia should be borne by Japan. Because East Asia was originally very peaceful, it was only after Japan occupied the four northeastern provinces on September 18th that it showed signs of turmoil. As for the prosperity and unification of our country, Japan has already destroyed them completely, so we dare not accept assistance! We only hope that we will no longer be destroyed in the future, which is already fortunate!</p>
<p>(3) Japan is determined to oppose to the end any actions by third parties that contain the separation of the coexistence relationship between China and Japan. China should understand Japan's policy and promote political and economic harmony between China and Japan. For example, France's loan to the Zhengtai Railway, Japan believes is fair assistance to China. However, Japan believes that international technical cooperation will promote the opening of joint management, so it opposes it.</p>
<p>This article explains that Japan does not allow third parties to interfere with Japan's aggression against China and opposes any international assistance to China. Our country is an independent and sovereign country and also a member of the League of Nations, and has the right to request assistance from the League of Nations. It is not yet known whether technical cooperation will promote joint management. If there is really such a danger, then our attitude towards joint management, like towards dominance, is to vigorously resist it, without Japan worrying for us. Our country's economic cooperation with various countries, if it is aggressive, not only Japan, but any country will definitely reject it.</p>
<p>(4) Restore trade between China and Japan, complete the East Asian economic sphere with Japan as the leader, and make China understand that increasing trade between the two countries will increase the welfare of the people of both countries.</p>
<p>What is called the East Asian economic sphere? Who recognizes Japan as the leader? This is a bit incomprehensible. Increasing trade between the two countries is certainly beneficial to Japan, but harmful to us. What welfare can the people of our country have to speak of?</p>
<p>(5) Make the Chinese authorities understand that the restoration of China's rural bankruptcy can only be achieved through cooperation with Japan and "Manchukuo," vigorously advocating economic cooperation between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo," which can promote the prosperity of East Asia and can also use this to save its own financial circles, and urge Chinese politicians and their guiding classes to understand their responsibilities, in order to realize the plan of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo economic alliance.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy of China's rural areas is the result of excessive economic aggression by imperialists. To save this crisis, we must do our best to resist this aggression. Cooperation with Japan and "Manchukuo" will not only fail to restore its prosperity, but will only accelerate its collapse. The so-called Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo economic alliance plan, whose plan is this?</p>
<p>(6) China raises tariffs for financial reasons to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods. This policy hinders the prosperity of Japanese industries. Japan must advocate from the standpoint of the people that the use of cheap Japanese goods is beneficial to consumers, and persuade the Chinese authorities to revise tariffs to reduce the burden on Chinese consumers in order to promote the sale of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Raising tariffs to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods is a policy that hinders the prosperity of Japanese industries, which is a fact. Because in this way, Japan's economic aggression cannot proceed smoothly. To overcome this obstacle, naturally, we must ask our country to revise tariffs. However, in the world, there has been no country that is willing to revise tariffs to allow foreign goods to be dumped. If it is said that this can reduce the burden on the people, then Japan can simply abolish tariffs and allow foreign goods to invade. Wouldn't the Japanese people be greatly benefited? What does Japan think? Who can accept such a request?</p>
<p>Overall, the six points raised by Japan are extremely unreasonable! Solving one or two hundred pending cases under these basic principles is really too early at this time! Unless the hearts of the people of the whole country are dead, I believe no one will accept it!</p>

<p>— Jia Huan</p>
<p>Summer days are very long; the cotton mill hasn't blown the whistle yet, and it's already dawn.</p>
<p>The black manure carts enter the alley every day at this time. The iron wheels rolling on the concrete ground make a rumbling noise. Then: "Emptying the chamber pots!" A sharp, knife-like roar, replacing the whistle of the cotton mill, stabs the people in their sleep like a knife, suddenly causing a sting, waking them up. The alley is filled with a commotion. The landlady downstairs, perhaps because she is old and has neurasthenia, is easily startled. When that first sound of "Emptying the chamber pots!" comes from the entrance of the alley, it is followed by her shouting.</p>
<p>"Yuying, the chamber pot emptiers are here, hurry! Sister-in-law in the back building! The pavilion..." After calling her daughter-in-law, then the sister-in-law in the back building, the pavilion, she calls them in turn. This seems to have become a fixed task for her every morning. She is like a clock in this house, and the tenants living here won't be late if they get up according to her standard. The one who gets up earliest in this house is the sister-in-law in the back building; she always answers first when the landlady shouts.</p>
<p>"Thank you, good old lady! I'm up." It's this sentence every morning; the tone is so gentle that it makes people feel happy.</p>
<p>This morning, I don't know why, maybe she fell asleep; the landlady downstairs shouted once, twice, but the sister-in-law in the back building still didn't answer. The landlady's daughter-in-law had already gotten up, and the woman in the pavilion had also left. I could hear all of this clearly. Why hasn't she gotten up yet? Could she really be asleep? I felt a little worried for her, and couldn't stay still in bed. "Sister-in-law in the back building! The good old lady downstairs has called, aren't you getting up yet? It's getting late, if you don't get up, you'll be late for the factory!" I was afraid she had really forgotten and didn't remember to go to the factory, so I reached out and knocked on the wall a few times.</p>
<p>"Ah!... Thank you, Uncle! I, I'm not working anymore..." The voice of the sister-in-law in the back building was a bit trembling, as if she was about to cry.</p>
<p>"What? Not working anymore?" My heart skipped a beat; "Is there no work at the factory?" I asked anxiously.</p>
<p>There was no answer; but she really cried, and cried very sadly. I heard her crying so sadly, and knew that her work had really stopped. But she usually worked very diligently, and I had never seen her stop for a day; she was always the first to get up in this house every day, and had never been late. What could have caused her to be laid off made one think.</p>
<p>The sun quietly shone in, warming the floorboards of the room, and the heat gradually increased. It felt like countless ants were biting all over my body, and my skin felt like it was being pricked by needles. At this time, I remembered the crying of the sister-in-law in the back building again. There was a big knot in my heart, and I couldn't sleep no matter what.</p>
<p>I jumped out of bed and paced around the room aimlessly; I still felt the distress of losing something valuable, like I couldn't find it for a while.</p>
<p>"Bang," "Bang"! Uncle in the front building!" Wasn't that the sister-in-law in the back building knocking on the door? I was suddenly startled and went to open the door.</p>
<p>"Uncle! I want to ask you a favor, would you be willing?" She smiled reluctantly; her eyelids were still red.</p>
<p>"Is it writing a letter? Yes, yes." I saw that she had a few sheets of paper and envelopes in her hand and quickly agreed. "Thank you! Really, I'm always troubling you, I'm embarrassed..." A slight blush appeared on her face, and she was afraid that I would see her shy appearance, so she quickly wiped her eyes with a handkerchief. "It's nothing, we live in the same house, why be so polite? Are you writing to Hankou? I know that the only one she communicates with is her husband; but I ask her like this, it seems to have become a habit, every time I write a letter for her, it's always like this.</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"What are you going to say in the letter? Wasn't it not long ago" that you wrote a letter? You communicate once every few days. Unmarried couples aren't as diligent as you two!" I joked with her, and she couldn't help but laugh. She said, "Uncle in the front building is really starting to joke; other people here almost don't have any food to eat, what's there to talk about being good?" She frowned tightly and took a slight breath.</p>
<p>"No food to eat? You're being too polite." I showed a distrustful look.</p>
<p>"Really, what's there to be polite about? Please write this for me: say that I'm not working at the factory anymore, and now I want to go back, tell him to send me some money quickly for travel expenses. I don't want to live in Shanghai anymore, there's no room for us to live in Shanghai, even if I have strength, I can't sell it for money: I'd rather go back to the countryside, even if I use up all my strength, it's much more comfortable than selling my strength for money in Shanghai and having to look at people's faces..." Her throat was a bit stiff again, like it was in the morning; her face was deathly pale, and beads of sweat the size of beans were dripping from her forehead, as if she had been drenched by a rainstorm. I wrote according to what she said, and when she finished speaking, I put down the pen.</p>
<p>"Is there anything else?" I said, "Aren't you going to tell him about how you came out of the factory?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I want to tell him: but if I write too much, won't you be tired?" She looked at me and smiled, seeming very apologetic. "It's okay, what's it to write a letter." I said confidently.</p>
<p>"Then, thank you!" She smiled again and continued, "I came out yesterday; I worked a total of twelve days this month and got three yuan and eight jiao of wages!!"</p>
<p>"What, twelve days only three yuan and eight jiao?" I interrupted her. "Yes! This is already considered good!" She said with a sigh. "At least tell him to send ten yuan, otherwise I won't be able to leave. There's no way around it, it's not that I'm unwilling to work hard; the reason is that the foreman has his own people and doesn't have a place to put them, so he's using us to open the knife..."</p>
<p>"He must have given some reason, right? He can't fire you for no reason if you didn't do anything wrong?" I began to doubt her words.</p>
<p>"Want a reason? That's very easy. His mouth is big, our mouths are small, his reasons are always right; he can find bones in an egg, what's so difficult about finding fault with workers?" She opened her eyes wide, looking at me with a very experienced look.</p>
<p>"Yes, this is their specialty; but what exactly did he find that was wrong with you to fire you?" I asked immediately.</p>
<p>"Listen! Listen and write it down as I say." She handed over another piece of paper, "Our kind of glass grinding work is simply like being a mason; all day long, our whole bodies are immersed in mud to make a living. That sand table, like a train executioner, turns along with the 'motor'; the water tank is hanging in the air, and the mud invades the tank and flows onto the sand table with the water. The wind power stirred up by the water and sand table sprinkles onto everyone like a rainstorm, and our whole bodies are covered with layers of mud, like falling in the mud on a dirt road in the countryside, and you can't even see your face when you get up. The nature of glass cups is very fragile, and if they touch uneven mouths, they easily break..." She took a glass cup to show me</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>, afraid that I didn't quite understand what she was saying. She continued: "At this time, if you are not careful, your own hand will suffer the same fate as the glass cup. It doesn't matter if your hand is cut at this time, no one will ask; however, at the same time, if you hear the sound of a glass cup breaking, the foreman will immediately rush over and scold you wildly with wide eyes. Don't I have many cuts on my hands? But because of these many marks, I have seen countless faces and heard countless curses!</p>
<p>Yesterday, the mouth grinder suddenly broke down; the foreman looked at the thousands of dozens of cups, feeling the anger of having no solution, jumping like a chicken in the water. 'Dead people! You don't know the machine is about to break, are you acting like someone who works? Rice buckets!' The worker at the mouth grinder listened to him scolding, standing there like a statue, staring at the broken machine; sweat was flowing down his face like rain, as if it were rivers drawn on a map. 'What are you standing here for? Are you waiting to be invited, huh?' The foreman grabbed the arm of the mouth grinder and pushed him forward. He woke up as if he had had a nightmare, and his body leaned forward, almost falling like a starving dog licking shit; the other workers laughed when they saw it. He finally fixed the problem with the machine; the foreman's steel-blue face faded a little.</p>
<p>The mouth grinder is not a coppersmith after all, although he barely repaired the machine, the cups that were ground out were not as neat as before. Thousands of dozens of cups were all like dog teeth, and when they were put on the grinding machine—sand table—they cracked and shattered. The foreman's two eyeballs were like man-eating monsters, staring with a pose of choosing someone to devour, his eyes turning on everyone's faces; at this time, judging everyone's final fate. Snap! A cup in my hand shattered; my heart jumped, and I stared at the sand table with my face burning, hating that it had to go against me at this time. At this time, the foreman's eyes were exploding with red veins as if they had been burned, he walked over and looked at me with a sneer; he said fiercely: 'If you can't grind it well, don't grind it; if everyone is like you and wastes cups, then why should this factory stay open? You probably don't want to do this dirty thing either, I know. You'd better go back and enjoy yourself, we don't need you here either; go to the accounting room to calculate your wages.' He quickly wrote the paper for taking wages and gave it to me, and walked away with a stern face. I didn't argue with him at all, but there was nothing to argue about; his mouth is big, and the reasons he says are always right. I took the wages and walked out, and I felt a lot lighter in my heart..." Her face was even more pale, like wax, and her chest was heaving, showing that she had difficulty breathing, as if she was hiding a lot of unspeakable pain in her heart; but on the surface, she pretended to be indifferent, her lips flickered slightly, and she let out a wry smile. "That's right, it's not good to go to another factory in this factory, can't I still sell my strength if I have it?" I knew that these words could not grasp her pain, but I couldn't find any more appropriate and considerate words to comfort her; what she needed at this time was not words, even if you spoke as moving and beautiful as a oriole, you couldn't fill the actual emptiness in her stomach.</p>
<p>"Um!" She smiled bitterly. Experience told her that this was my forced comfort; "Shanghai doesn't have my life; isn't every factory the same as this one?" "Don't be an official if you have no one in the court," people like me who are lonely will suffer the same fate wherever they go!! Thank you, Uncle! I'm sorry for troubling you to write for so long, really..." She stood up reluctantly with a sad look and said a few polite words to me and left.</p>
<p>I looked at her back and felt a surge of sympathetic sadness. "Ah! Poor woman!" Gently floated out of my mouth.</p>

<h3 id="e287">Although a Small Vendor, He Can Support Himself Without Anyone's Pity. His Arrogant Spirit Is Innate, With No Notion of Depression or Injustice. The Transformation of the Eccentric Old Man Ding. <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Xinglin</p>
<p>I remember a certain great writer once said: "Has anyone ever fallen from a well-to-do family into poverty? I think that on this road, one can see the true face of the world." The two paths of wealth and poverty isolate people, and after a transformation, one's physique and the warmth and coldness of the world will be tested. This is not wrong at all.</p>
<p>In Tianjin, there is an old man Ding who sells tangdui (that is, hawthorn fruit dipped in rock sugar, skewered with bamboo sticks, called "tangqiu" in the South and "tanghulu" in the North). When he was rich, he spent money like dirt. When he was poor, he supported himself without anyone's pity. He was playful and cynical, but his innate arrogance is worthy of admiration and infatuation.</p>
<p>Lin Moqing once wrote a short biography for him, saying: "Ding Ziboyu, people respectfully call him Old Man Ding, is a son of a prominent family in Tianjin."</p>
<p>His family used to have a customs office job, what Tianjin people call a big customs house. Most of the prominent families in the town were relatives. Boyu was born with luxurious surroundings, and his clothing, food, and entertainment were all he could ask for. When he went out, he was carried in a sedan chair with attendants, just like a noble official." Reading this passage, one can see a rough outline of his life. At the age of sixteen, he inherited his father's business and "entered the customs" to work, but he did not get rid of his extravagant habits. It is said that he smoked opium. When he was about to go out, the doorman would call the sedan carriers to wait, but the sedan carriers would also be lying on the couch, not yet satisfied with their opium addiction. He was not anxious, but laughed and scolded, and stood in front of the door to wait. It can be seen that Old Man Ding had a broad mind and a generous demeanor, putting himself in other people's shoes and being able to understand the suffering of the sedan carriers. His four sedan carriers all wore gray squirrel mandarin jackets turned inside out in winter. From this alone, one can imagine his luxury in those years.</p>
<p>He was originally a childlike person full of interest, often looking for novel things to amuse himself. When the bicycle invented by Westerners was first discovered in Tianjin, all the riders were Westerners. He immediately bought one, and his control was very skilled. Ding was the first Chinese person in Tianjin to be able to ride a bicycle. He also held hundreds of strings of money and bought dozens of pounds of sugar. In the living room, he placed a stove, a copper pot, a stone slab, and other things to learn how to make tangdui. He originally did it for entertainment, but unexpectedly, he later used this profession to support himself. His short biography also says: "When the Boxer Rebellion broke out, the family was burned and looted, and the customs office was cut down. He went from being very rich to being penniless, but he refused to borrow money. Even if relatives and friends pitied him and helped him, he would refuse. He only made various kinds of sugar food, carrying a basket and selling it along the street. His family of eight relied on this for more than twenty years."</p>
<p>The tanghulu he made was famous for its excellent quality. First, because he had fallen from being a son of a rich family to a small vendor, he did not covet heavy profits. Second, because the things he made were very exquisite and indeed delicious. It is said that he had unique characteristics in the work of boiling sugar and dipping fruit. The tanghulu he made was crystal clear and crispy, could be placed in ashes without getting dirty, and could be placed in his arms without sticking. The sales were very wide, earning three or two yuan a day, more than enough to make a living, and he was leisurely and content. He never felt any emotion or depression about the rise and fall of his fortunes. The reason why Ding is called an eccentric is actually due to this.</p>
<p>When I was in Tianjin, I heard his name and spent two days trying to meet him, but I never succeeded.</p>
<p>Old Man Ding died in 1929 at the age of fifty-seven. He had no children and his old wife died first. Once, he was carrying a basket into the market, selling loudly, and accidentally met his relative in the West Jieyuan area. The relative pitied his downfall and wanted to give him money to persuade him to change his profession, but Ding refused angrily and said, "This business cannot be done, what kind of industry can be done? You think selling tangdui is base, but I think opening a pawn shop or setting up a jewelry store is not necessarily noble." After saying this, he angrily waved his sleeves and left, while the relative was greatly disappointed. In the eyes of others, they all thought that he was in a bad mood, but in my opinion, it was really a famous and true saying.</p>
<p>Another time, he met a friend in the North Daguan area. That person was afraid that he would be embarrassed, so he deliberately turned his head to avoid him, but he caught up and stopped the person, laughing and saying, "You still owe me money. Don't avoid me, I didn't ask you for it!"</p>

<p>— Li Qing</p>
<p>On the open space at the bend of Beijing Road, a large canvas tent, underneath which sits a semi-circular wooden cabinet, a homemade film projector, and a pitifully old small motor—this constitutes a "street movie theater."</p>
<p>"Shasha, didi dang, shasha, didi dang..." the small motor gasps for breath.</p>
<p>"Four copper coins for a look, do you want to see the Righteous Volunteers fighting the Japanese..." This is the mobile advertisement.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>The person sitting there winding the film shouts desperately.</p>
<p>The audience here isn't the young mistresses and wives seeking pleasure outside, nor the gentlemen with top hats and "walking sticks," or the well-dressed young men and women holding hands. The audience here is the ordinary masses, dressed untidily but with thick arms. They work all year round, their lives are too bitter. During this only holiday, they want to have some fun, they want to seek some comfort, so they spend four copper coins to watch a movie because they can't afford the movie theater.</p>
<p>After paying four copper coins, I was also led to the front of a hole, sitting on a bench about three inches wide. The person who brought me pulled the string that struck the copper coins. The cloth covering the hole was then pulled up. Thus, the situation inside the wooden cabinet was fully reflected in my eyes. Inside the cabinet, there was a small screen, and nothing else. On the outside of the cabinet, there were more than a dozen holes, which were for the audience to watch the show.</p>
<p>I watched a short film about the Righteous Volunteers fighting the Japanese army. There was no main character, the main characters were the "Righteous Volunteers" and the "Japanese army." The plot was very simple. The Japanese army used cannons and machine guns to attack the Righteous Volunteers, and the Righteous Volunteers were defeated. But the Righteous Volunteers had spears and broadswords, and a lot of people, so they counterattacked and finally defeated the Japanese army, and that was the end. Although the film was so simple, projected so vaguely and unclearly, and the small motor kept "shasha, didi dang..." shouting, many people watched it with great interest. When the Righteous Volunteers counterattacked, some people even shouted. After the film was over, some people cursed, wanting to "fuck" the Japanese people's "eighteenth generation ancestors"... From this, I realized the effect of this kind of film.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but think of the current movies. What are the current movies like? Let me go and inspect them.</p>
<p>As long as you walk past the entrance of a movie theater, the electric poles, the red lights, the large advertisements... they will catch your attention; but when you see clearly, you will always see words like "sensual blockbuster," "extremely hot," "fleshly," "voluptuous breasts," "snowy legs," etc. This kind of movie has completely become a pastime for young ladies and young masters. Our "artists" who are "art for art's sake" have "artified" everything... to relieve the boredom of young ladies and young masters. Our "artists" don't care about anything. In order to please the young masters and young ladies, even if they distort the facts, they don't care.</p>
<p>What's the use of such movies?</p>
<p>Although recently there are said to be many relatively "progressive" films (but they still inevitably play the role of embellishment and distortion), it doesn't solve the problem. For example, in this time of national crisis, the most urgent issue for us is how to fight for national liberation and independence. This is certainly not a matter for a small number of young masters and young ladies, but requires the people of the whole country to rise up and do it. Can the current movies shoulder this responsibility of propaganda and mobilization? Moreover, even if there are good films, they cannot reach the general public at present. On the surface, theaters seem to be very casual places, where anyone has the opportunity to enter; but in reality? In fact, movie theaters have signs that say "no money, no entry." So, how can the current movies achieve the task of reaching the masses?</p>
<p>Since seeing this "street movie theater," it made me think of the issue of "popularizing movies"; this naturally refers not only to the content of the film, but also to the form—the form of performance is included, that is to say, making it possible for everyone to see it.</p>

<h3 id="e289">Wheel-less Spherical Train <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qi</p>
<p>I once saw a new type of train in a magazine, which was said to be the fastest and most unique in style, but unfortunately, it didn't tell us what it was all about.</p>
<p>Later, I heard people say that this is a train without wheels, which is even stranger. A train without wheels is like a fish without fins, a bird without wings, and a horse without legs, isn't it?</p>
<p>But this was the view of two or three years ago. Now, it has gone from theory to complete realization. From Moscow to Noginsk, there is such a train called "spherical train," its number is "SH-4-", and it officially started "carrying various goods" this year.</p>
<p>The model of this "spherical train" was first trialed in Yarmolchuk, a few kilometers away from Moscow. It can let you take a ride, and it will surprise you when it starts moving. Its speed and turning ability are not comparable to ordinary trains. Its track is trough-shaped, twelve centimeters wide, and made of the most rigid concrete.</p>
<p>The train itself is an interesting combination of bicycle, tram, and mine. The cigar shape of the train is best to reduce air resistance and achieve its maximum speed.</p>
<p>Under the train, there are two large spheres, one in front and one in the back, which are exceptionally smooth. When turning, it sways to one side like a rocking boat. If you are riding for the first time, this kind of turning will surprise you, thinking that the train has overturned.</p>
<p>The speed of this train is 250 to 300 kilometers per hour, four or five times faster than the fastest express train.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is a vast and resource-rich country. It takes a very long time to travel from City A to City B. With this train, the time will certainly be shortened, calculated not in days but in hours. For example, a person living 150 to 200 kilometers away from Moscow can very well go to Moscow to see a night show and go back to sleep at the same time as usual. This is not just imagination!</p>
<p>This spherical train will overcome distance and time!</p>

<h3 id="e290">Coolies <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>North Borneo Correspondence</p>
<p>North Borneo (Nord Borneo-insulae) is also known as Borneo by some and is a British Malayan colony. Its largest seaport is Sandakan, followed by Api and Douou. Timber is the largest product, followed by rubber, betel nuts, coconuts, salted fish, and fruits. Every year, no less than 18,000 "coolies" (meaning laborers, slaves) are shipped in from China. The majority are forced into the mountains to cut timber and collect rubber. They work over ten hours a day, and their labor is compensated at only ten yuan or so a month, and they must also endure multiple layers of exploitation by the coolie heads (foremen). Due to the dry climate and the hardship of life, as well as the mountain mists, miasma, wild beasts, and poisonous snakes in the mountains, deaths are reported daily (the so-called dead coolies). In reality, once they are forced into the mountains, even if they have great abilities, they have no hope of returning to their homeland. They can only remotely yearn for the shadow of their homeland across the sea. Fate is decided: a coolie for life, a slave for life, until death.</p>
<p>In the mountains, the coolie heads—the foreign capitalists' trained dogs—are very clever. Every dusk and night, they open their opium dens, fan-tan games, pai gow games, bullfighting... attracting a large number of coolies to gather. They say this is to regulate the workers' monotonous lives. Opium can be bought on credit, and even gambling money can be borrowed. Their opium and gambling businesses are very advantageous, even if the "mata" (police) come, it doesn't matter, because the coolie heads have already obtained permission from the bosses (British). More precisely, the mata have received "usage" fees.</p>
<p>Sunday is usually a day of rest, the day when the coolie heads' wealth flows in, the day when their opium dens and gambling houses have the best business. But some workers will also take a small steamer to go to Sandakan for a while, or go to a brothel once, to regulate their sexual monotony. But it costs at least ten dollars. If the coolie head is willing to guarantee credit, that is also possible.</p>
<p>Sandakan is a so-called largest seaport in North Borneo, the necessary entrance to all the mountains, and the general gateway for transportation to various ports. There are often two ships coming here from Hong Kong—Jardine Matheson's Siu Sang and Mau Sang. Other ships from Singapore, Little Luzon, and some unbranded ships arrive every month. Imports are some groceries, and exports are timber, coconuts, rubber, fruits... Sandakan looks like a village on the outside. The majority of residents are Malay natives and Chinese. In terms of transportation, there are no trams or rickshaws on land, only a few cars for government British officials to ride in. Water transportation is all dugout canoes and longboats, which transport goods, and there are only two sand boats that carry people, rowed by Cantonese Tanka girls. The post office is a small wooden house made of wooden frames. All recipients must personally inquire whether they have a letter and personally pick it up because the post office does not have mailmen. There is one main road and three side streets. Most of the shops are opened by Chinese, and some are opened by Malays. The largest Chinese shop is Wan Ho Yuen Trading Company, said to have several million in capital. There is also a Sai Shing Gold Shop opened by Chinese. The next are food halls, tea houses, grocery stores, opium dens, a large gambling house, and sixteen Chinese brothels, one Japanese-run Shimizu Imperial, one Japanese-run Shimizu Imperial Cuisine, and one Japanese brothel with the large letters Z0.3 written on it. In this respect, Sandakan really has some of the flavor of Monte Carlo. The Chinese residing in Sandakan, apart from some staff, shopkeepers, and prostitutes, are those "gamblers" and some so-called "big hats" (wealthy people). Gamblers make a living by gambling, and they must have capital on hand to do so. The so-called big hats refer to those rich people, such as shop owners, brothel pimps, owners of large gambling houses, and even coolie heads are included. Sandakan's economic authority is entirely in their hands. As for Sandakan's administrative power, it is in the hands of the Governor of North Borneo and the local government, which are composed of British people. The government has a Chinese Affairs Secretary, who specializes in handling all Chinese affairs, and the director is also a British person. The Chinese also have an authoritative Lin Min Ding (Wen Cheng), who is a local gentleman, a high-ranking Chinese, and the Chinese in Sandakan, North Borneo, treat him like a consul. The situation of the Chinese community in North Borneo is roughly like this.</p>

<p>— Shu Sheng</p>
<p>The completion of the First Five-Year Plan can be proven by the development of the fruit tree industry. Replacing those small orchards scattered around, mostly planted with old-fashioned methods, the world's largest, specialized orchards with modern machinery have now been established. For example, the "Giant" orchard covers 2,400 hectares, the Eskine State Orchard covers 2,600 hectares, the Rebedin Orchard covers 2,400 hectares, the Diyemaiti Vineyard covers 1,900 hectares, etc.—these large areas are all planted using specialized methods.</p>
