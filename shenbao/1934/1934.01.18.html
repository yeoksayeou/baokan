<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國復興問題與羅斯福之貨幣政策　英</h3>
<p>美國自實施復與法案以來。迄今已逾半載。但所謂恢復繁榮的最高目的。至今尙無實現之期。物價不振生産過剩。貿易减少失業增加。一切的一切。在美國國内到處都鬧着不景氣之問題。依然十分嚴重。因此許多人士。對於華盛頓政府所採用之策略。能否由此恢復資本主義昔日繁榮之地位。不免根本上發生疑惑。然據日昨海外電訊。美國現又實施一種新政策。較之以前所施行的策略。如停止金本位。如收買國内外黄金。似乎又更進一步。但自吾人觀察。此種新政策。仍舊不脫以貨幣政策而冀達到怡高物價的圈套。</p>
<p>美國新政策之内容。有兩點最爲重要。（一）聯邦凖備銀地所有之黄金。須移交與美國財政部。而由財政部以同等價値之美元。給予凖備銀行作爲信用（二）現金一槪不得流通。廢止金幣。亦不兌現。私藏現金、須交由財政部收買。此外尙有新頒法令三項。主要意義則在於管理國外匯兌。禁止資本逃逸。亦爲禁止現金在國内流通以後之必然步驟。所謂新政策内容之大力。如是而已。　　吾人首當認識羅斯福新貨幣政策對於國内所生之影響究竟如何。新貨幣政策之基本目的。在於提高物價。特别是抬高美國國内物價。假使物價能抬高至一九二六年時之水凖。則在是年同時所起之債務。由債務者地位以言。可以是到易於償還之利益。因此美國當局。便以爲美元之現金價。値若能降低百分之四十。商品之美元價値。亦當由此抬高百分之四址。由此以觀。商品的價値。似乎可以由美元含金成分之多寡而加以操縱。殊不知商品價値的决定因素。是在於社會實際的購買力。購買力發達。然後價値才能向上。否則商品只有永遠囤積起來。價値烏能抬高。他姑不論。祇看美國農民。苦輩所有者爲堆積如山之農産而非黄金。黄金之美元價値。儘可以由二十元零六角七分漲至三十五元。而農産之美元價値。則不必有同樣之增加。除非用人工方法。將農産燒燬至價格抬高爲止而後可。由此以言。依新貨幣政策所欲達到之目的。所謂提高物價者。實未必有實現之可能。</p>
<p>美國新貨幣政策。對於國内物價。雖未必有若何影響。但却可爲美國政府生財之道。爲美國政府增加收入計。較任何方法如加稅舉債之類更爲迅速容易。據美總統羅斯福稱。美金中之純金成分减輕以後。政府獲利。約達四十二萬萬元之巨。卽在全年歲入以上。此則由於黄金管理權一轉移間之結果也。惟吾人所不可忘者。卽美國政府已同時停止用純金以償付政府債務之義務。故由影響而言。羅斯福新政策之唯一作用。尙在此而不在被焉。</p>

<h3>排斥黄禍</h3>
<p>日本政策危害世界和平</p>
<p>促歐洲民族團結謀抵禦</p>
<p>羅馬　［意大利人民報］登載意相墨索里尼所撰關於遠東問題之論文、此文係爲美國某通信社而作、意大利各報對於此文已久有所聞、按墨索里尼親自發言、表示排斥［黄禍］之立塲、已屬第二次、當去年十一月十四日亞洲學生大會在羅馬開會、墨索里尼業經發表演說、陳述日本政策之危害、此次所撰論文、足使此一問題因而生色、意大利人以爲此文作用、乃在促進意美與意俄之友誼、墨索里尼文中謂中國與日本之對抗、不至永久存在、因此證明新歐洲必須團結而後可、而意大利則爲調和歐洲與亞洲之媒介云、吾、人猶憶日本宣告退出國聯會時、意國輿論以爲歐洲應團結以謀對付、墨索里尼頃所發表之論文、實與此具有同一意味也、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>表示不與合作决心</p>
<p>國聯新任命管委會主席</p>
<p>薩爾問題已成激烈爭端</p>
<p>意法聯絡保障奥國獨立</p>
<p>西門彭古首途赴日内瓦</p>
<p>（柏林）　今日德政府致函國聯秘書處、聲明於最近幾星期内之小組會議討論薩爾區域事件、德國不願列席、按德政府昨日接到國聯照會、謂行政委員已將薩爾事件列在國聯議程之最後一節、故雖德國已退出國聯、然仍可列席惟德國政府對國聯秘書處之申明、則謂德國缺席、則行政會議可得有充分之機會從長計議云、（十七日國民電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政院不理會薩爾問題現已成激烈爭端、今日通過谨克斯爲薩爾區域管理委員會主席、並其他各委員之任命、任期至一九三五年四月止、衆視此項决議爲國聯决計施其權力於薩爾爭端、並抵抗國社黨對該委員會之攻擊、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>薩爾問題</p>
<h3>形勢極爲嚴重</h3>
<p>管委會提出報告</p>
<p>陳述希黨之暴行</p>
<p>薩爾由國際軍隊佔領</p>
<p>國聯會有週杪討論說</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　薩爾問題現在形勢較預料者大爲嚴重、國聯所委任之薩爾管理委員長、關於希特勒黨人在該區宣傳之暴行、將向國聯行政院提出新事、據目下甚有一種有力傳說、謂國聯行政院本星期底將討論國際軍隊佔領薩爾之事、至於一九三五年薩爾臭民投票是否將展期一難題、行政院自當有一决定、如决定展期、則德國方面定有特殊舉動、因希特勒正要救該領土不待自决投票、卽劃諸德國也、薩爾管理委員會最近報告　關於該區國家社會黨部大肆活動一節、曾大書特書、据稱、希特勒黨人曾對官員凌逼、並借慈善名義、强迫居民對國家社會黨部捐欵、更自抄獲柏林方面流入之文據觀之、薩爾國家社會黨部曾奉密令、招募勇敢有爲富於軍事經歷之忠實信徒云、因自决投票一經舉行、則定局將不能變更、故有多人主張展期、以待德國狀况之變遷、而使薩爾人得爲眞正之德人云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>彭古出席參院</p>
<h3>說明外交政策</h3>
<p>保障奥國獨立維持歐洲均勢</p>
<p>對德不欲取包圍勢但求合作</p>
<p>（巴黎）　參議院討論外交質問案、外長彭古起立作答、將當前各種外問題加以說明、首先謂法國對於國際問題、雖不以呌囂爲事、業已於必要時表示意見、目今時局並無使人躁急憂慮之理由</p>
<h3>薩爾公民投票</h3>
<p>至於薩爾問題、法國業已表示見地、該地應否舉行公民投票、惟當地人民有權决定之、非法國所可放棄、法國所能爲者、係以國聯會會員資格、在日内瓦方面出而與聞其事、法國唯一關心这點、厥在保障該地人民得以自由表示意見、而在日後並不因其表示之故、受人虐待耳、</p>
<h3>維持奥國獨立</h3>
<p>至於奥國正受希特勒黨壓迫、時有暴行發生、實則奥國獨立、係屬歐洲均勢關鍵、必須予以維持、法意兩國對於此層意見相同、以上種種雖關主要原則、究係消極政策、</p>
<h3>無意包圍德國</h3>
<p>舍此而外、法國在外交上尙當努力建設、不稍間斷、當新德國政治演進引起憂慮之際、法國欲使同感憂慮各國聯爲一氣、俾各國决意維持和平者、得以國際合作爲基礎、互相團結以充實力量、非有包圍德國之意也、德匣如欲加入此等國家、其權操之德國本身、前者德國建議訂立互不侵犯條約、法國當已接受、其心跡如何、於此可見、</p>
<h3>與衛星維舊好</h3>
<p>彭古繼稱法國對於同盟各國、仍維持舊好、不稍放鬆、又因四强條約之訂立、而與意大利接近、但法國并不因此而疏遠其與國、此於各種公布之文件及換文可以見之、法國曁各與國之諒解較之從前、更有生氣、更爲活動、此種諒解、在法國視之、並非以一集團、反對共他集團、法國此其所爲、可視爲國聯會範圍以内、建設和平整個計畫之一部分</p>
<h3>歐洲布安全網</h3>
<p>法國之意、欲使此種恊商範圍、愈推愈廣、俾成爲歐洲之安全網、此安全網雖未組織完善、然自最近數月以來、已大有進步、法國對於波蘭及小恊商各國、一方維持彼此間原有條約、一方更由外交上援助各該國、俾與意大利·蘇俄·巴爾幹各國及土耳其之關係、得以改進、</p>
<h3>意法關係改善</h3>
<p>彭古繼稱、法國與意大利之關係完全改觀、而小恊商各國與意大之關係正在改進、亦爲確定之車實、中歐各國之改造、有待於意大利及小恊商各國之參加、如彼此關係改善、則此種參加、卽有實現之可能矣、</p>
<h3>聯俄政策成功</h3>
<p>法國對歐洲東境、實行聯俄政策、蘇俄内部雖從事革命建設、然由國際言之、實爲歐洲現行秩序之保守者、法國因目前在國際上不能有全盤安全計畫、乃陸續訂立各種局部條約、以資救濟、此種局部條約逐日增加、必能集腋成裘、蔚爲和平建設矣、</p>
<h3>努力和平建設</h3>
<p>此種和平建設之全部計畫、雖驟難樹立、然已局部實現、蘇俄曾與多數國家訂立互不侵犯條約、其行經亦與法國相同、蘇俄雖不在加國聯會之内、然對於各會員國皆予以援助、而各會員國亦援助之、蘇俄與各國所訂之約、其形式雖不及羅卡洛條約之精確、然其功用亦正相等、羅卡洛條約雖受各方批評、然其包含之諾言、確有舊時同盟條約之價値、蘇俄與各國所訂之約、旣與羅卡洛條約之功用相等、則其價値殊値吾人之稱贊、</p>
<h3>對巴爾幹問題</h3>
<p>彭古旋談及巴爾幹問題、謂南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞·希臘及土耳其四國之間、不久可訂立互不侵犯條約、以保障各締約國領土之完整、並希望保加利亞亦能參加、意大利對於此事、並無異議、</p>
<h3>始終擁護國聯</h3>
<p>最後彭古謂、法國對國聯會始終表示完全信任、其態度不待重行贅述云、</p>
<h3>議員相繼發言　均對德不信任</h3>
<p>彭古詞畢、議員高特羅發言、極力說明、法德妥恊之不安全、對於法俄恊商亦特别提出保留、謂戰爭發生之時、不能依靠俄國之兵力援助、對於俄法商約之實行、并要求保障、至是前總統米勒航艉立致詞、勸法國人民精誠團結、對德國和平建議表示不信任、米氏詞畢、由前駐羅馬大使儒佛納爾致詞、謂法國在國際談判、不可常聽旁人占先、尤以法德談判爲要、儒佛納爾以爲法德談判之中、伏有維持和平之機會、又謂法國與各國所訂之同盟、必置諸歐洲整個建設之中、始能有效、最後泛論侵犯他國領土完整　他國主權之不當、以爲各民族間已有分别團結之可能、特團結範圍不可失之寬廣、而其最大範圍、係屬國際聯合會云云、至是宣告散會、定星期四日重行開會、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意外次赴奥京</h3>
<p>討論增進貿易關係</p>
<p>意對奥友誼之表徵</p>
<p>羅馬　意國外交次官蘇維志今日啓程赴維也納、因去厬奥總理杜爾夫斯曾來訪意相、故蘇氏現往奥答訪也、此爲意國對奥友誼之表示、亦爲奥國决心獨立之表徵、意國見國社黨在奥之活動、頗爲惶慮、故力助奥總理撲除之、意外交次官游奥時、或將討論增進奥國在特里斯特與阜姆兩處貿易之方法、奥國依據和約固應在阜姆享有自由口岸之便利也、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>美國捕獲日本間諜</h3>
<p>攝取要塞地點照片</p>
<p>美國紐傑賽州寇尼城　日本國有鐵道職員五人經此間鐵路共察破、疑係間諜、當經拘捕、後由此間日本副領事擔保、始予釋放、按此五日人、曾在此間攝取鐵路及橋樑之照片、又此間海軍工廠現正建造驅逐艦兩艘該日人等亦在該廠相距不遠之地、攝取照片該五日人被捕後、查得其中一人、前曾違章開駛汽車、經查詢時、揑報姓名、因此更徵實有間諜嫌疑、但該事件不當視爲有嚴重性質、華盛頓國務院某高級官員宣稱、美國無禁止餐國人攝取照片之法律、但在要塞地點攝取照片、則在所不許云（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（紐約）太白洛資報今日在正幅以大字登載紐遮西州克爾尼地方有日人五名、攝取橋梁照片、致被拘捕之消息、現悉被捕日人於盤詰數小時後、因日副領事之干涉、業已釋放、當局現調查基八美手續是否合法之問題、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>羅斯福貨幣政策實行</p>
<h3>國際市塲受重大威脅</h3>
<p>英國着手鞏固其商業地位</p>
<p>幣戰結果將促成幣價穩定</p>
<p>(華盛頓)　羅斯福總統之貨幣計劃、不但是美國本身之大問題、並須牽涉國際各國、此間經濟專家預料、總統計劃實行後、立卽將有國際匯兌戰爭、英美兩國之貨幣價値互相低落結果、鼓勵兩國之對外貿易、英國對於總統提議之二、○○○、○○○○○○元匯兌平衡基金、異常焦慮、蓋其影響於金磅之力頗大、倫敦已着手凖備維持其國際商業之地位、一般人預測、英美兩國貨幣戰爭之結果、卽能促進國際之穩定、美總統亦具此意、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今日閣議對於美總統羅斯福之貨瞥案、曾費長時間之討論、因其影響於英國金磅及國際貿易市塲至爲重大、此次閣議、原爲討論外相西門赴巴黎及意國之報告、席間並議及對及對於各屬殖民地當格外連絡及合作云（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>美國</p>
<h3>停購國外現金</h3>
<p>貨幣案可望通過國會</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　財部今日稱、金價現仍定爲三址四元四角五分、金融善後社昨午起、停購海外現金、新金價適將美元價値减至法定價値百分之六十、財長摩甘索今日對參院銀行與貨幣委員會說明羅總統接收所有貨幣金及以有伸縮性的辦法减輕美元價値之計畫、新聞記者包圍摩甘索、詢以種與國際通貨立卽有關之問題、摩氏答稱、吾人當善自爲之並稱、金融善後社已停購海外現金、因其所有存金現爲財部所接收也、但也要佈置、尙未擬妥云、參院共和黨今日集議、决定要求關於羅總統貨幣程序之充分說明、但尙未决定切實態度、國會多數民主黨現信羅總統所提出之貨幣法案、不難通過、衆院鑄幣委員會現凖備聽取關於金剅現狀之意見、聞柯夫林敎士亦將向該會陳述其意見、按柯有無綫電敎士之稱、對於時事常作非官塲之批評、故其名著聞全國（十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　國會内對於總統之咨文、頗多異議、白銀派議員均非常失望、卽衆議員威勞氏之十六對一之白銀提案、亦黯然無聞矣、據參議員斯格路享氏對記者言、白銀問題一時恐暫不討論惟渠深信現在新近自鑛内取出之白銀、若賣入鑄幣局、仍當照每盎斯六角四分半作價、决不受總統咨文之應響、且最近開採銀鑛事業、自此規定價格實行後、頗爲發展云、</p>

<p>高橋談</p>
<h3>日金解禁問題</h3>
<p>（東京）　美國何時實行减低幣價、爲另一問題、日本之實行减低幣價亦僅時期問題、高橋藏相對於金解禁、亦以爲應减低幣價、發行新幣、今日談話如下、但觀世界財界之情形、若將來金解禁時、以以美國爲始、當然不能不减低幣價、金解禁之時期、何日能實行、現尙難逆料、政府起草中之保有國内産金法案、亦以此爲前提而起草者所謂平稀匯兌資金制度、係别一問題、該制度由事實之例觀之、其效亦甚菲薄云、（十七日電通電）</p>

<h3>王延松辭</h3>
<p>王延松演稅云、兄弟今日參加婦女國貨運動大會、忝居主席團之一、對於過去籌備經過情形因爲未盡明瞭、故不再向諸位報告、爰將個人管見所及、略爲諸位來賓貢獻、第一、今天舉行的大會、是促進國貨發展的一個有組織的運動、凡到會來賓、不論男女老幼、黨應一律本此意義、負一種宣傳提倡國貨的責任、以身作則、使漸次推及全國、第二、本會定名爲婦女國貨運動宣傳大會、但其命意、是廣義的、不是狹義的、因爲提倡國貨、爲四萬萬同胞任何人所應負的一種天職、並非因爲今年定史婦女國貨年、便應由婦女們去提倡、可以不關男子們的事、吾人知道國貨救國爲當今之急務、凡爲同胞自應同此目標、不讓人先、努力做去、尤其是男子、在社會上服務見聞較切、印象尤深、更其要明瞭提倡與服用國貨的重要、加緊努力、至於婦女責任方面、以家庭而論、所有一切採辦購買事宜、均操有獨一權威、向來家庭之中、各種用品、尤其是化妝品、可以說多數仰求舶來、這或許因爲少數欠缺智識關係、有以致之果能趁今年婦女國貨年的今天起、一致自覺起來努力提倡國貨、使今日舉行大會的效果、發揚光大、達到國貨救國目的、這是兄弟願與諸位共勉、</p>
<h3>葉家興詞</h3>
<p>葉家興演說云、吾人於民國廿二年開始之際、卽以此年定名爲國貨年、一年之中、運動宣傳、不遺餘力、但究其實際、外貨入超、仍有增無减、質言之、可謂效果殊微、因此失敗之經騐、吾人以爲此後提倡國貨、須改變傾向、從女界方面本身作則、此其中有兩原因、一因現代家政、無論其家庭之組織如何、均操於女子之乎、故自飯食服御以及消耗娛樂之品、其如何購備、大都由主婦主之、而爲男子者、並無若何成見、故婦女而愛用國貨、則一家之中、斷無舍國貨而就外貨之理、此其一、一因婦女富於愛美心理、而外貨之矜奇炫異、又爲愛美者心理所樂趨、且社會中又有牢不可破之觀念、謂外貨之精美、决非國貨能比肩、此種觀念、任其流播擴大、實爲國貨無形之障碍、故吾人因此必須將國貨之美觀適用、而婦女界普遍宣傳、矯正其錯覺、此其二、同時又因吾國女界、素富有節儉惜費之美德、故男子浪擲金錢、往往因女子之人格感化而覺悟、此種風氣、在近年都市之中、雖已漸漸消失、但大多數尙能保持此種美德、故婦女咸能改用國貨、間接可以造成男子之崇儉尙廉風氣、此其三、以上爲吾人主張婦女國貨運動之由來、希望女界諸君努力云云、某餘演詞均略、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>讀書計劃（一）</h3>
<p>讀書指導··</p>
<p>接到貴部登記證後，我眞有說不出的欣快。我祇等待天快黄昏，快快打過十點，我的工作便可解放了。我可以自由自在來檢閱過去我一人寂寞的自學歷程上所犯的錯誤，我要坦白陳出，我還要按照貴部研究的手續，草出計劃，作出第一次的通信。</p>
<p>唉唉！事情眞不凑巧、偏偏今夜輪着我包銅元，十點鐘後，我仍在一封封的包紥。這工作一直延續到十二點，這眞苦死我了，店中的規矩過一點全體人員都得上床，否則明天起不來床、是要受責罰的。</p>
<p>先生！我現在又繼續寫了。時間是隔了二十四個鐘頭，正是第二夜的十點三刻，今夜我可寫完這通信了。</p>
<p>先生！你以爲以上的閒話可以抽去麽！不！决不能！這是我的實際生活、一個學徒的實際生活。你們必先知道，才能了解我的要求，纔可給我可能吞下的糧食，我才能受到貴部的敎益；同時你們的工作不致落空啊！</p>
<p>我是這樣忙迫的。每天十小時的正生活，不列入正工作的雜事，聽憑經理，管事先生們决定，是［不成文的］法典，不能由你預定。但是，我從生活各方面注意··以敏捷，靈活，有條理各項去節省濫費的時間，塡補非［業規的服務，］於是我每天仍有二三小時的多餘的閒空，可以用在讀書上。我時時刻刻是緊張，所以就是在讀書上也極想用最少的時間與精力，換得最大的效果。</p>
<p>我相信，這種努力是可能的，介是我還未獲得這努务應取如何的方法？</p>
<p>以前的自修，多是偏於國文方面，所以我在文字上頗有一些進步。去年從報紙雜誌上看到許多人，談社會科學，自己也想找些讀，後來又從昔日同學處、借得一些了。但我馬上遇到兩個難題，第一是看不懂，第二是書太厚，不便於一晚看幾面。因爲他不像小說，今天放下，明晚接續看，他的情節不易於接上，這類書，本已難懂，一放下，第二天非從頭看過不可。不然你更不能讀下。我用了非常的忍耐，結果還是所獲有限。於是，我再向朋友要求借薄本的、更通俗的書，他笑道··［在中匣還没有啊］。最後，我仍祇得硬着頸子讀，讀，雖然也一本一本的總算讀完了，但是所付的代價是過大的。（未完）</p>

<h3>敎部督學鍾道贊談</h3>
<p>視察京市敎育</p>
<p>敎部督學兼科長鍾這贊、對於此次視察南京市敎育之報告、正在編製中、頃與晤談、承告視察印象、記述於下、</p>
<p>▲小學敎育　南京市立小學共三十九校、學生一五九二六人、經費四十四萬五千五百十二元、市立義務小學共三十校、學生五四四二人、經費七五零八四人、已立案私立小學共三十校、學生四三六五人、經費九萬八千四百元、未立案私立小學十六校、學生一九五八人、經費三三七六八元、各機關公立小學六校、學生一千六百餘人、市立幼稚圍十六、學生八八八人、私立幼稚圍五、學生二百四十人、此外尙有校名未詳、敎會性質之私立小學五六十校、學生經費數均未詳、又私塾共五七四處、學生一四九九五人、市立小學與義小及私小經費合計七十萬元、連公立小學及敎會性質之私立小學、總計將近八餘十萬元、加上私塾收入每處以三百元、平均計算當有十七萬之數、是京市小學敎费總額已逾萬元、就此觀察、感覺到京市敎育、比較二十一年度以前、各種數量都增加百分之十、同時人口亦增到百分之十、（京市現有七十三萬人）若照一般普通標凖、十人中應有一學齡兒童計算、則七十三萬人中、應有七萬三千學童、惟此標凖不適用於京市、因京市五方雜處、有許多公務人員及軍警界、多無家眷與學童、實際計之應有學童、不到六萬五千、現有在學兒童四萬八千、雖尙有一萬七千之失學兒童、但比其他繁盛都市之小學敎育、已較爲普及矣、</p>
<p>▲中學敎育　市立中學一校、學生四六五人、經費五九八九二元、公立中學（省立南中南女中、中大實校）三校、學生一千五六百人、經費二十餘萬元、立已案私中十四校、學生五八四六人、經費五十四萬九千九百元、未立案中學八校、（尙有未調查確實及勵志遺族等數校在外）學生九五四人、經費九四七五二元、公私立合計經費總數約百萬元、全市中學、多係普通、由公家辦理之學校、較私校爲多、而所占經費比私校寬裕者多、</p>
<p>▲社會敎育　京市有民衆學校二十八、學生一九七一人、經費一七○五元、社敎機關十四、補習學校二十四、（内有四校係職業性質）文化團體四十八處、</p>
<p>▲敎育經費　二十二年度市敎衣經費、共六八三五八二元、其分配初等占百分之七十七面弱、中等占百分之十一而弱、（職業占中等經費百分之二四、中學占百分之七六）、社敎占百分之七六、下年度（卽暑後二十三度）計畫、定預算爲九四八四九四元、擬支配初等占百分之七十四而强、中等占百分之十三、社敎占百分之一○、一三打算、職業占中等經費百分之五一·五、（擬設高級工業一校職業補習二校、初級職業一校）中學占中等經費百分之四八·五、其中師範設三班、此爲此次部督學與市方會商結果、市方擬照比預算計畫進行、暑後能否完全達到、要看將來的事實該市敎費獨立事、最近經市府指定財部恊欵及房捐一部份爲敎育專欵、（如有不足再臨時指定專欵補充）每朋怍入、存放市立銀行、不作其他用途、同時由市府秘書長、社會財政兩局長、及中小學敎職員代表二人、共同組織敎費保管委員會、以專職責、而謀保障、</p>
<p>▲敎育行政　京市各校當局、對於部頒中小學以及師範職業等規程、多半未能奉行、尤其是關於每班學生人數、徵收費用、敎員授課時數、敎訓合一、青年指導、勞作敎育、男女分校、行政組織等等問題、有甚多地方、不能與部頒規章一致雖說間有特殊困難情形、不能完全照辦、但受過去習慣的支配、不去改革、亦爲事實所不免、希望加以改進、</p>
<p>▲敎學設備　有少數學校如鍾英·安徽·中大實校、（省立兩中學由陳參事視察鍾未談到）對於理科都有相然之設備、而勞作敎育之設備、除市立一中與中大實校外、餘均簡陋不堪、有少數學校、並此科而無之、殊與中央希望勞作敎育之目標、相差甚遠、</p>
<p>▲敎學方法　各科敎學方法、如國語英文社會理科等、多採用講演注入方式、未能利用材料與時機、令學生自學工作、</p>
<p>▲訓育指導　訓育及學生指導方而、有許多私立中學、受經費困難影響、往往多招學生、每班有七八十人、到三年畢業時、學校敎職員、除認識學生姓名面貌外、幾於不能作其他之認識、自談不到了角學生之個性、更何有於升學及職業指導之設施、同時敎育行政當局、對於中小學生之升學及職業指導一層、未能遵照部頒辦法積趨進行、</p>
<p>▲義務敎育　市立義務小學、爲救濟失學兒童、以少數的金錢辦多量的事業、學生成續、就一般說、尙過得去、惟有農點要加注意、（一）校舍與設備、太覺簡陋、（二）敎員人選及敎學也比不上一般普通小學、（三）課程偏重語言數學、三四年級仍採全日制、與一般小學相同、故學生升學人普通高小、尙無特殊困難、惟對於整個敎育之生活、欠缺甚多、至所能升入多高級小學、多半非水平綫以上的優良學校、自不能因其與並通平常的小學程度偶能銜接、卽認爲成績相當之證據、因此要謀接務小學的成績優良、必須利用優良的設備、才能得到相當的效果、决非簡陋不堪設施不完備的學样所能表現出小學敎育之全部精神、故京市義務小學、此後應特别注意設備與敎學、</p>
<p>▲體罰現象　許多小學、有實行體罰者、查體罰爲過去不自然及富於隋性之一種敎育方法、爲法令所嚴禁、决不能令其存在、希望地方敎育當局、分則查明禁止、以免惡習慣蔓延、致影響小學敎育之發展云、</p>

<h3>願預兆年歉</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>雪是預兆年豐的，所以年年有雪，年年秋收大有。誰知年年豐收，農家却年年嚷窮，這是什麽緣故呢？我們只聽見農人在說［熟荒］，熟和荒是相對的，愈的會連在一志而成名詞呢？我們不懂經濟學，自有懂經濟學的人在發揮宏論、不知道他們的宏論，幾時發生影響到農家？農家的現實生活，幾時能够團　得好些？</p>
<p>前幾天這勞什子的雪，又漫天價洒下來了。自然，就科學立塲，也是祥瑞之物，把害蟲凍盡，包管明年又是熟年。只怕明年還是在熟字下連着一個荒字、從憔悴的農家怨憤的口氣中吐出來。</p>
<p>元盛如梓庶齋老學叢譚說，賈似道因着臘月無雪，麥功不長，在五更初烯燭焚香，對天默禱，這天未午雲騰而微雨，薄暮而雪，入夜大作，二鼓數寸矣，三鼓銀牌批瑞雪應時，祈求感應。那位半閒宰相，居然愛國愛民至此，老天居然感應，盛先生說得未免有些肉麻，他不知道瑞雪儘管應時，元兵還是深入。</p>
<p>革命時代，科學時代，自然没有人最肯說祥瑞了、誰知負着與論先導的那些内地的地方報，竟大書着［瑞雪］。我們非但看了肉麻，並且也有些心痛了。日本人在東三省看見了大雪，還够得上稱他瑞雪。至於預兆年豐，恐怕更非百分之七十的中國農民所希望羆。因爲他們倒願意年成不好，米價貴些，反而實惠，這是我親見農人說的，什麽心理呢？</p>
<p>今年的雪，落得快，積得快，消处快，自始至終，不到十二小時，一會見盡成瓊樓玉字，會兒依舊甕鵬繩樞，這倒可以作閩變的象微呢。</p>
<h3>歲暮的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>在四馬路中一家大書店，某一天的營業，只有一角二分錢。</p>
<p>清晨起來，聽說寶昌路角的一株小樹下吊死一個人，我爲好奇性驅使，過去觀看，那屍身還掛着樹上，一個四十來歲的小本生意人模樣，披着一件石路上買來的舊大衣，帽兒落在地上，面色慘白，口眼半啓。看鬧熱的圍住了一大羣，不負責任地推測着說··［總是爲這幾天天時冷了，年關到了，受不起飢寒的交迫，債主的追討，而自盡的罷，唉！可憐！］</p>
<p>當你在晚上九點多些走過北四川路老靶子路附近一帶時，會有人强拉住你去嘗西式的肉的滋味；你也會隱約地聽到喊呌ThreeDollarsOnly丨丨只三元錢便彀丨的聲浪。</p>
<p>在北河南路中一爿預備關門的鞋子店，門口站着兩個做滑稽式的老搭擋，雖是手中拍着鞋底，嘴裏狂喊着大减價，可是進門去買便宜貨的，還是很少！</p>
<p>一個賣粢飯的對我說，往年每一個早晨可賣得二三十千錢，而今只三四千，二分賺頭，一天開銷還不够。</p>
<p>某一家影戲院，一天夜塲，只有三個觀客。</p>
<p>理髮店第板也在嘆氣說··［今年或許比往年天氣更冷罷！爲什麽一般人怕來剪頭髮？］</p>
<p>名人書畫，在這個上頭兒也不値錢了，欣賞的人比較往年少，收賣的正如鳳毛麟角！</p>
<p>大减價，冬季大减價，眞正，非常，特别，忠實，犠牲，忍痛，拍賣，出清，招盤，關店，種種大减價，鮮麗的旗幟招展着，聆耳的軍樂吹打着，這一切的一切，無非表現着歲暮的悲哀。</p>

<h3>談天竹子</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>天竹子折枝插瓶，與臘梅水仙同爲歲寒雋品。一名南天燭，亦作約天竺，爲常綠灌木，習見吳楚諸地，樹長三五尺，間有高至尋丈者，但不易見耳。且高者不結實，葉似苦揀而小，經冬不凋，三四月間開小花，五瓣色白，結子成簇，至冬漸紅，有似丹砂，襯映雪中，甚爲可愛，變種甚多，花有絳色而結實或黄或白者。性喜陰而惡濕，最宜植諸於庭除附墻間。壅以黄泥，自然茂盛。不可澆糞，若澆祇須冷茶野雉鵲毛水，敬於秋日髠其幹，留取孤根，則旁生條枝，低矮可作盆景，爲書齋清供　　天竹子有似古美女子，娟娟可人，又似雅士，瀟灑無俗韻。惜寓居湫隘，無隙地可種，且更遷徙無定，否則扶疏枝葉，旁列石筍一二事，對之令人忘世蠲慮，不必肥遯，而自得山林隱逸之趣，　　歲尾年頭，滬上畫錦里二馬路一帶，賣水仙臘梅與天竹子者，麕集以爲市。然人多作僞，有以已墮之子，扦插於枝間，非不股紅可喜，然購之歸，不多時而子萎枯轉爲黑色，審察不愼，動輒受愚也。</p>
<p>張子祥雖以畫牡丹著名，然其他竹石蘭菊，亦超逸拔俗，爲人所重。一日作屏條，爲春夏秋冬四景，糩至末幅，忽因細故興妻爭執，妻怒，擲其畫具於地以洩忿，盎中𦢲脂，潑濺及於畫幅間，點點不可勝計，子祥亟執筆就之爲天竹子一叢，别有意致，反遠勝於平常所作，從此索畫點景爲天竹子者，絡繹不絕，生涯爲之大佳。</p>
<h3>某瞎子（下）</h3>
<p>— 慧劍</p>
<p>瞎子惱怒得滿額壳的青筋都凸漲了起來，他憤然地走近了四先生的身邊，冷冷的聲音說道··［人人都是這樣，人人都愛打聽，而又人人都不肯相信；爲什麽徐老九便要哄騙我呢？他是我最好的朋友，他盼望我的瞎眼被誰治好，已經十幾年了，五年前他告訴了我，馬珂里沙的名字，他是說得那樣眞誠丨銀子打成的藥瓶倒出些黄水來蘸在眼皮上，就是了，他說的話我是一個字也不會忘記的，他爲什麽要騙我？告訴你，馬珂里沙這個人實在是有的　　劉四先生本來想說［因爲徐老九是你的好朋友所以他纔要騙你］，但他很明顯地右道這樣話說出來，定會扯碎了這瞎子的心的；他立刻用和平的笑聲說道··［你眞勇敢，但我想馬珂里沙，現在也許已經很老了。］</p>
<p>瞎子冷靜地說道··［是的，如果他活着，他今年是七十二歲了，但是我還要找他，我已經找了他五年了。］</p>
<p>他伴送瞎子渡過一條離本村最遠的河，過河，便是别一個村子的地界了，他眼見瞎子顚巍巍的背影，逐漸迷茫地沉没在那遙遠的不可追究的邊極里，而且想象他攔住每一個行路的人，用他那奇異的沉悶的不論使誰聽了都要發煩的聲音，問着··［請告訴我丨丨先生，馬珂里沙還活着嗎？］</p>
<p>四先生是永遠不會饒恕這徐老九的出奇的罪惡的。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十三回</p>
<p>創痛難堪凝神聽鼓樂歡情未洽促别到飛符</p>
<p>積之一見，也就有幾分虛心，於是斟了一杯茶低了頭慢慢的呷着。他在呷茶的時候，趙翁有意無意的說了幾句話，積之也不曾聽到，只是低了頭去喝茶。趙翁冷眼看着他，也就不說什麽了，自己背了兩隻手，在空地裏走來走去，半昂着頭，只管看那山上的紅葉。相持着約莫有半小時，誰也不曾作聲。趙翁復走回座來向積之笑道··二爺，我們興盡而返，也就不必再上山去了吧，我們可以找兩頭牲口，慢慢的回去。積之站起來笑道··我們在這裏坐着時間太久了，大槪上山去是有些來不及，一同回去也好。於是掏出錢來會了茶賬，二人走到山脚，雇了兩頭驢子，沿着大路走回去。約莫走有四五里路，又遇着後面兩三輛汽車追了上來。這大路上的地皮，經過大車軋碎了，本來，就是一層很厚的浮土。現在汽車由浮土上飛馳過去，便是一叢土燄飛騰，迷了人的耳目。積之看那車上，正是一個軍官，左右夾着兩個女郎呢。他將頭偏到一邊，咳嗽了一陣，走了上百步路，那飛塵方纔息落下去。他在驢背上笑道；老太爺，你瞧見嗎？在汽車上的人，就是剛才在西山館店樓上摟着女人開心的，這種人說他能够救國救民你相信嗎？趙翁嘆了一口氣道··瞎！這也呌没有法子。積之笑道··我說一名笑話，您可别生氣。將來趙連長作了師長軍長的時候，您可得叮囑他一番，不要學這些軍官才好呢。趙翁道··你這倒是正話。人在無錢無勢的時候，看不出什麽壞處來，一到了有錢有勢，什麽壞脾氣都便出來了。不過我那小子，照過去說，倒還老實，將來我就不敢說。可是有軍長師長，也輪不到他頭上呀（二九四）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>雪話</h3>
<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>幾天的暖和，和一夜的北風，雪，早像飛絮扯綿似的，漫天飛無。一片銀光，遮盡了世間的高低崎嶇；屋字是瓊裝銀裹，山林是玉　粉堆，人間一切的一切，都變了光明純潔。踏上高樓一望，眞是瓊樓玉宇，萬里一色！世間點綴表面的事，呌做［粉飾太平，］然而人的力量，終究没有大自然的偉大！雪，才能粉飾一切，才能裝成天地間平坦景象！</p>
<p>關於雪的故事，像孫康映雪贖書，王子遒雪夜訪戴，孟浩然踏雪尋梅等等。都是聲名普普，載之史册。孫康這種書獃子，據說現在學校當局，見了最見頭痛。王子遒這種獨腹脾氣，現在也行不通了。祇有孟老夫子的雅人深致，最爲風靡一時，址足摩登。請瞧不久的將來，孤册林處士墓前，鄧尉香雪海裏，定會連翩地光臨若干要人名流，閩秀墨客，尋梅踏雪，來點綴這大好河山。</p>
<p>因着歐風東來，到了聖誕節邊，一般新式商店，也要在玻璃櫥窗裏，布置一幕應時雪景，表示認識時代。一班摩登姑娘，爲表現歐化起見，以前不足一顧的堆雪人，抛雪球的雪地追逐，也會在公園北風裏商興表現。可惜這種盛舉，還未普及内地，蘇州街頭巷尾所堆的雪人，還祇是頑童們乎創的藝術，未見高妙。可是去年在某成佛店門首的那令雪獅子，却崢寧雄奇，虎虎可觀；可惜這種藝術作品，祇有幾個頑童欣賞，日光一出，早隨流水澌澸，影踪全無。</p>
<p>聖誕老人，是一個紅袍白髯，和藹可愛的老人家。他常在雪地裏反人們需要的恩物、暗地裏送給人們，尤其是孩子們，更是唯一的恩物賜予者。在孩子們聖誕節甜夢醒來的當兒一年來所盼望的東西，早高高地懸掛在襪子裏了。所以歐美兒童、對於聖誕老人、瞧做唯一可愛的恩人。這雖是歐美人哄騙孩子們的神話，但聖誕總是外人快樂的日子，好似我國的廢曆新年一般。但在現在我國社會經濟日漸崩潰的當早、人們對於過年，也大有王小二過年的境况，假使世間眞有聖誕老人的話、我眞願他也像蕭伯納般惠臨中國一次，向人們送些恩物。可惜歐美經濟，也大都自顧不暇，我的理想，也不過像望着這粉也似的白雪，不能眞的變粉，來盡療人間飢餓啊。</p>
<p>雪是六角形的結晶物，所以我國人呌雪做［滕六公，］幼學裏說，雪花飛六出，先兆豐年。據古老相傳說，冬雪可以殺死一般傷害草木的害蟲，可以雪下得越大，那種蟄伏的害蟲，抵抗不住雪的寒感，就完全凍死了，到了來春，草木萌動的當兒，害蟲旣死草木發榮滋長，一無蟲豸蛀蝕，自然五穀豐登，年頭大熟了。所以雪可以卜來年年歲的豐歉，不過春雪的功效，却和冬雪相反，所以雖是一般白雪利害却絕端不同。</p>
<p>我幼時曾瞧見一則關於雪的故事，含意深刻，是給一班不知貧苦的富人深深的一刀，那故事說··某年齊國大雪，齊桓公深居那爐火熊熊的深宮之中，絲毫不覺寒冷，他奇怪了，去問晏平仲說··［這眞是奇事，一連下了三天大雪，却絲毫不覺寒冷，這是什麽綠故？］晏平仲回答得好，［大王住在深宮暖皖，飲着羊羔美酒，自然不覺寒冷，可是外面的小百姓却已不知凍死多少了。］一般住在水汀房中的人，請在賞雪的時候，也想想這段故事。</p>

<h3>婦女國貨年中之日貨</h3>
<p>— 仰䒪</p>
<p>婦女國貨年的成績如何？我們還没有見到，可是觸目驚心的報紙，大書特書的說··［提倡國貨聲中，劣貨進口大增，僅僅兩個星期中，已達五萬餘噸，直接運華北的，更多四倍。］</p>
<p>最近日政府鑒於中國抵貨運動的銷沈，已在組織對華貿易統制機關，以日華貿易株式會社爲主體，直隸於日本外務省通商局長及其商務官指導之下，其組織内容··（一）設總社於日本大阪。（二）由對華貿易各公司及在華商業團體，共同辦理對華輸出貿易。（三）在天津，青島，漢口，福州，上海，香港六處，開設分店，管理各該颧域内貿易。（四）由通商局任命總經理，并密切聯絡駐華商務官，互相合作統制商品輸出，及開拓新市塲。（五）運輸機關，亦實行統一，由該社直接辦理。（六）增設駐在中國内地之商務官員，調查内地市塲，設法開拓。該種毒辣的手段，恰好在婦女國貨年頭，向我們進攻，只靠我們這樣糼稚的國貨工業，豈能和他抵抗？我們應知這不是國貨界的生死問題，實在是我們全民族的生死問題。我們現在没有别的，只有一致的服用國貨，來救國自救。人人認定服用國貨，爲民族道德的起點，民族復興的基本，婦女界固然責無旁貸，男子們更是義不容辭。不但男女界一致堅持，通力合作、卽政府和人民，也要眞心誠意，切實提携。陶君樂勤嘗語記者謂··［統制經濟，當先從統制進出口貿易開始，倘使進出口貿易没法統制，儘你提倡什麽統制，什麽統制，都是没有用的。］這句話極有見解。我以爲政府在今日，見於日本對華貿易統制的急進，千萬不要再徒托空言，虛與委蛇，諱言經濟的抗日，以自趨於絕地。顧亭林先生言··［天下興亡，匹夫匹婦與有責焉。］國民！國民！在這生死關頭，我們再不要旁觀，再不要推诿，再不要冷待，再不要善忘，請看這個年頭，究竟能否自救？</p>
<h3>要認一半錯</h3>
<p>— 沈愛蓉</p>
<p>今年是［婦女國貨年］爺兒</p>
<p>們暫時退後一步，讓我們娘兒們來幹一下。現在一齣好戲還只啓幕，各位女主角們能否始終如一毫不鬆懈，賣力的演下去得一個美滿的結果，博得滿堂采聲，這當然要看娘兒們的努力了！</p>
<p>在過去，人們丨丨當然爺兒們占多數丨丨總是怪娘兒們不愛國，樂於推銷仇貨，好像中國實業之不發達，完全是娘兒破壞了的。在最近又有九萬萬元入超，婦女用品占多數的報告，給爺兒們捉到了一個很大的把柄，老是嘮嘮叨叨的數說娘兒們的不好。</p>
<p>我不否認娘兒們是愛俏的，面上紅紅白白，身上花花綠綠，但，硬要說娘兒們不愛國，至少，是娘兒們之一的我，是不甘默認的。</p>
<p>以我校小範圍講，今年女同學們的皮大衣，都是到蓬萊市塲去定做或購買，這可以見得娘兒們也有些覺悟了。但，這些做大衣的呢絨是否國貨，我却不敢担保。</p>
<p>鄕下女人到上海來剪衣料，老是喜歡到小東門去，因爲又便宜又好看，但這些美而廉的布的來源，是很痛心的，大半是仇貨。不過娘兒們是没有錯呀！這些布店全都是我國貴同胞開的。有的雇客恐拍上當，問一聲是否國貨，回答你的不但是國貨而且有某廠出品的商標做證據，不由你不信。在辨别力薄弱的娘兒們，尤基是鄕下來上海的娘兒們，怎知道内中的玄虛呢？丨丨就是爺兒們恐也不能知道吧！</p>
<p>爺兒們是最愛吹毛救疵的，看見娘兒們打扮得動人些，就硬指定是不愛國，難道只有穿件大布衫兒才配稱愛國吧？那末穿老九和買的本國貨的綢緞，穿蓬萊市塲買的皮大衣都是不愛國、都指爲仇貨、未免有些太過吧？</p>
<p>總之，大家要認一半錯，娘兒們果然要名副其實的做去，不要辜負了［婦女國貨年］，就是商界的爺兒們把良心放正中些，不要黑眼珠看見白銀子，把愛國的赤心變黑了才好。</p>
<h3>希望幾個女人</h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>隨［婦女國貨年］的啓露，而瀰漫了我整個社會國家的［婦女提倡國貨］聲浪，在現下像日月終天，江湖行地，早成了我們全國婦女界當前最重要最切實的工作，而對於國貨振興，洋貨杜塞的前途，當然亦必有顯著的成績，但是，以我的管見，我們巾幗中的人物，却有幾個，因着特殊的原由，可以倡導大衆，影響社會，所以必須希望好們的先爲導河，那麽全國靡然從風，他的效力自然更大，現在單以我所想得到的，舉出幾個，寫在下面··</p>
<p>一，電影明星電影的感化社會，本來是效力最大的，而電影明星的一舉一動，影響於社會民衆，自然尤巨，從今年起，我全國的電影明星、誠能首爲提倡，服用國貨，並且，在國産影片中能够都有提倡國貨的表演，像［春蠶］［香草美人］一般地背景，以帝國主義經濟侵略，婦女界喜用外貨，而致金錢外溢，國産不振，以最没痛最激烈的結局，去打動我全國婦女的心弦，促緯國貨的矢志愛用，他的收獲，自不必言。</p>
<p>二，大，中學生近年來我國各地的大學中學學生，每喜穿用外貨，尤其是一般女生，艶服奇裝，簇簇生新，而一觀其衣裝，則一無國貨的痕跡，相率成風，實屬痛心，從今年起，務須根本憬悟，服用國貨，並由敎師規定，一切校中文籍書件，主無論制服便服，均須採用國貨、否則一經查出，卽勒令退學，而師生聯合，一致從事宣揚國貨運動。三，婦女各界的領袖人物發高一呼，萬衆歡從，做領袖人物的　無論政治界，銀行界，敎育界，以及一切的職業界，與名媛賢婦，在本年，當然，尤須希望她們負起責來，服用國貨，首爲倡導，務使全國靡然從風。</p>
<p>提倡國貨的責任，本屬凡人皆有，今年爲［婦女國貨年］，我們做婦女的，自然更須努力，而我上列的幾個人，責有攸歸，義不容辭，當然尤須辛勤果敢，奮發有爲，向充滿着生氣的路上，大踏着脚步前進。</p>
<h3>國貨與摩登婦女</h3>
<p>— 立秋</p>
<p>從去年的［國貨年］到今年的［婦女國貨年］，提倡國貨的聲浪總算是高徹入雲了。雖然我們在客觀上所看見的仍然是大量的［入超］與國貨産銷的不景氣，但是，我們總不能否認我們主觀上之偉大的努力，已經在提倡國貨的聲浪中建立起相當的基礎了。</p>
<p>今年是婦女國貨年。這是說明··提倡國貨的責任，不僅是男子負担，而且要以婦女爲中心來負担起這個任務了。所以每一個中國婦女占在婦女國貨年的舞臺上，就應該下最大的决心，在實際上努务犦倡國貨，使這一婦女國貨年的意義更加豐富而充實。</p>
<p>現在，一般的摩登婦女，身上穿的是巴黎倫敦的名廠出品，臉上擦的是幾十元錢一盒的外國化裝品，一切日用品，從鞋帽手巾以至一個小提包、者惟恐不是外國貨，似乎不是外國貨就不摩登，不是舶來品就不時髦一樣。花錢的多少在她們似乎没有關係，而對國家利權的損失却更是她們所夢想不及！</p>
<p>今年的婦女國貨年，首先我們就要提起這些摩登婦女的注意··我們要以最大的努力糾正這種不正確的風尙。我們必須指明，由外國貨所表現出來的摩登與時髦，這不是眞正的摩登和眞正的時髦。這種表現，正是表明了自己的無識無知，在提倡國貨的聲浪中，這是一種可恥的行爲！</p>
<p>眞正的摩登和時髦，是從那純高的理智上所表現出來的對於國貨的愛好。雖然國貨在某些方面没有外國貨好，但是一個婦女，倘若是用國貨，穿國貨，那嗎，她在穿用和裝飾上的摩登和時髦，才足表明他對國家和民族的喜愛，才是表明她是有智識，有理智的摩登婦女　　在提倡國貨聲浪中，摩登的意義根本就當重新解釋··</p>
<p>無論你穿的是一九三四年式最時髦的衣服，用的是最名貴的巴黎流行化裝品，但是，因爲不是國貨，所以不是摩登！</p>
<p>只有用國貨的婦女，才是眞正的摩登婦女！</p>
<p>宋先生討着他夫人笑咪咪的說··今年是［婦女國貨年］，你一身穿着，都是國貨，堪稱摩登婦女們的先覺份子了。</p>
<h3>鐵的敎訓</h3>

<p>熱烈的演說。雪片似的傳單。</p>
<p>［扺制洋貨！］［提倡國貨！］在每一個婦女的心中，燃起了熱烈的民族及國家觀。一二八的慘痛在他們腦中悸動！　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>

<p>［本埠恊中百貨公司，向爲日貨傾銷之代理機關，平常以賤價購買日貨，冒用國貨工廠之商標出售，日得據婦女國貨運動委員會第七調查隊探悉，當卽派員前往搜查，卽於貨棧内收出原裝之日貨多種。該委員員以證據確實、經全體一致之决議，不日卽將該公司没收，充作救國基金云云。］</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>不幾天，報上又有一個啓事··</p>
<p>［史明理律師代表　張永貞女士申明與恊炽公司經理吳良離婚啓事··據敝當事人張永貞女士聲稱，永貞於七年以前因朋友介紹與吳良君結爲夫妻關係，本冀共同努力，以達服務社會提倡實業之目的。不意該吳良近兩年來喪心病狂，貪圖小利冐用國貨工廠商標，濫銷日貨，近更變本加厲，對於國貨運動施計破壞，永貞本於愛國熱忱，累加勸告，奈渠一意孤行，毫不顧忌，近更因思想不合於感情日劣，永貞爲自己之人格計，絕不願與此認賊作父之人共同生活，除已將吳良濫銷日貨等劣跡報告婦女國貨運動委員會外，並與該吳良宣佈脫離夫妻兹係等語······］</p>

<p>這是婦女國貨年，婦女提倡國貨的浪潮，必然會給輕視［娘們］的人以一種鐵的敎訓。</p>

<p>在去年丨國貨年，這整個的一年裏，我們可眞喊膩了一切提倡國貨的口號，但是，他的結果呢？顯露在我們面前，却爲入超九萬萬元，開從來未有之新紀錄，眼見東西洋的倭奴，碧眼兒，都在那裏捧腹大笑，反映着我們國貨界，却正喊破了喉嚨，至無人接應，這責任，倘加以細細思索，當然，我們全國的婦女界，是不能逃的，所以從今年起，定名爲婦女國貨年［讓娘兒們來幹］由我全國女同胞、共同負起責任來提倡和服用，自然，這種偉大的動力，要比去年的空言高論，切實得多了，不過若照現在的情形而論，却絕應以雙方面同時來觀察一下，這就是都市婦女與農村婦女，她們對於國貨問題的異點，須要我們去分析和研討的。</p>
<p>（一）都市婦女　多數外貨的傾銷，自以都市婦女爲他們的直接消費者，所謂摩登女郎，自頭至足，無不以穿用外貨爲榮，像化妝品，絲織物，以及一切的家常日用品，那一件不是她們玉手纎纎的購去，滾滾金錢的流出，這種可痛的事實，怎不呌我們昨舌稱奇，但仔細想來，都市婦女的所以如此，也不過是被一種可惡的虛榮心所誤，社會普通惡劣風氣的束縛，所以她們本性的喪失，也是暫時的。</p>
<p>（二）農村婦女　我國原是農業國，自桑自織，而家庭手工業又很興盛，所以，初也根本無須舶來品的，但是，自從海通以後，外貨傾銷，如水銀瀉地，無孔不久，當然，農村婦女對於洋貨的採購，像洋布，火柴，以及一切的日常用品，也不無因魚日混珠，或因貪價格低廉，而有所採購。</p>
<p>那末，我們根據以上的事實，就可得到一個確切的觀點，關係過收都市婦女與農村婦女。對於國貨的摒棄，和洋貨的樂用，他們就有一個清晰的區分，一個是完全因趨於虛榮心的激使，一個却是因貪價廉，或竟是在盲購，所以，我們以後的工作，將這樣地去分别指導，以收全功。</p>
<p>家庭訪問記</p>
<h3>楊衛玉夫人</h3>
<p>— 天雲</p>
<p>楊衛玉夫人，卽是一位長於文學的彭望芬女士，彭女士，研究師範敎育出身，是富於文學的天才，在中華職業學校擔任國文敎師。他蝚得意的著作，是中華職業敎育社出版的一本［敏兒的母親，］寫得入情入理，爲讀者所深佩。最近楊先生彭女士參加婦女國貨年運動，並爲各報做了幾篇提倡國貨文字，尤見他們夫婦的熱心毅力。一天記者特地去訪問楊君夫婦的家庭，小小的房間，很是清潔樸素，一桌一椅，一箱一櫉，者布置得整整齊齊。楊君穿的是布衣，楊夫人穿的是國貨綢緞，蝚近楊君新做了一套國貨呢絨學生裝，楊夫人也是做了一套國貨呢絨大衣，三個小孩子都是活潑潑地，穿了國貨服裝，跳躍的從學校裏回來、楊夫人也是課畢回家，實行她做母親的任務。楊先生是窮苦出身，最近出［長城］刋上，發表他［離家的前一夕］上，寫得址分沈摯。所以他的起居飲食，可以說得到淡泊自甘。楊夫人是吳門望族，自小嬌養慣的，可是一到了楊家以後，屏除鉛華，避免奢侈，也是克勤克儉，實行其梁孟的生活，他們用錢，也是實行預算决算的政策。目下他們所有衣食服用，差不多非國貨不用，一針一綫一火柴，也惟國貨是求，有一次楊夫人和吾說［我走遍了中國國貨公司，買不到一根國貨的針。後來吾調查之下，最近中國國貨公司已有青島針公司的出品。楊夫人說··［婦女國貨年中，提倡國貨，只有根據家用項目入手。國貨出品年來已一天進步一天，衣食住三項，外貨有的，國貨那一樣没有，裝潢美觀，並不較外貨遜色，經濟耐用，且反過之。我們何必定學洋氣，仰給於外貨？譬如糖果，中國儘多佳品，何必定要［巧克力］，花雕酒歐美人個個稱贊，何必定要［威士忌］綢緞布疋呢絨，中國很多新出品，何必定要［維也納］［法蘭呢］［巴黎緞］，所以我們女子，從今以後，只要先從家用範圍内屏除外貨，力崇國貨做起，今年的成績，一定可觀。拫希望許多婦妇團體，大家起來幹他一下，我想今年最容易看得見的，便是這驚人的進口貨數字，一定可以减低下去。］彭女士的見解，和她實行提倡國貨熱忱毅力，確可敬佩。彭女士家庭的淡泊樸素，專用國貨，尤其値得我們的訪問。</p>

<h3>合理的觀念</h3>
<p>— 聶曾紀芬</p>
<p>今日言提倡國貨之法，請離抵制外貨與仇貨，並離提倡國貨，而求其先决問題；第一應促進國人合理的觀念，今我國種種失敗，與世界各國之腐化，皆由於觀念錯誤之所致，其要點在以驕侈奢富爲可貴，而卑下貧賤可恥也。今人動言提倡欲望以促進文化，而事實上則欲望與文化不並立也，惟東方哲人崇尙實騐，其立說與比相反，獎勸貧儉，惡斥奢富，至於勵勤勞而斥驕惰，更不待言，周以上不論矣，漢以來名政治家，晋以來之詩人，多有此明切之表示，而立爲學說者，厥爲孔孟，論語中斥富貴而獎貧儉者，多至十數處，如顔回簟食瓢飲在陋巷能樂，子路衣敝褞袍不以爲恥，皆稱其賢，大禹菲飲食卑宮室惡衣服，舉以歎美，凡人類本同具重富輕貧之劣根性，雖力加矯制，猶難改正，况今日更輸入西洋之拜金惡風，昔日之以爲非者，今日則以爲是，利之所在，無不可爲，遂造成此畸形之社會，與危迫之時局，金錢之溢出，工業之彫零，失業者之衆多，皆由於此。</p>
<p>近數年來洋貨入口激增，駭人心目，原因固多，而時裝美術之獎進，其一大端也。工廠女工向皆着粗藍布短褂，近數年則大多數剪髮，着印花細布之長袍矣，此衣料美觀而價極廉，一袍之料，不過二元左右，女工月入十數元，自以爲力所能及，不復惜吝，然每人須製備冬夏春三件，此廉而美觀之印花細布，不問而知爲何國物也。職業較優之家，又製較美之衣，上海一隅女工以子萬計，其他婦女，以百萬計，更推而至全國，積之而成可驚之巨數矣，十數年來，學生競尙西裝，固已爲銷耗一大宗，而與西裝相連屬之用品，更爲巨額，富厚者鞋襪動値數十元，每一出門衣服必換新樣，以在高等地位及受高等敎育者爲之提倡，加以畫圖報紙爲之鼓吹獎勵　而全國風靡矣。今圖補救，仍須從社會領袖婦女爲之表率，以樸質裝飾相當，使人人造成一新觀念，以儉素爲合理，華美爲不合理，而後可言提倡國貨也。甘地提倡着手紡粗紗所製之布，以粗布爲愛國之標記，而英國對英輸出，陡减一半，其鐵證也。</p>
<p>吾更有欲言者，卽近日婦女仿效西人露臂露腿，着高跟鞋，長絲襪，殊屬無謂，民族應各自有獨立精神，豈可隨人追逐。且此等裝束，不適衛生，吾見友人，因高跟鞋跌斷腿骨者，尋常妨碍操作，更無論也。冬令則傷風者多手帕不離鼻，犧牲健康，乃至生命，以超時尙，可謂有智力乎？蜷髮作燙曲形，且須至是髮店爲之，費財費時，大可不必，此皆西人無意識之行爲，尤須知其爲非合理生活中應有之事也。吾所見日本婦女，五十年來，服裝未嘗稍改，全國除娼妓外槪未剪髪，吾國人之所爲，能免彼之竊笑耶。</p>
<p>婦女與國貨談座</p>
<h3>閒談奶奶經</h3>
<p>— 兪洽成</p>
<p>亅經濟的收復失地丨</p>
<p>如果你不明白什麽是國貨運動，或是懷疑婦女國貨年的話，這裏所告訴你的，不是什麽空論，祇有重將一句老話提起。據說，自從海禁大開以後，外國人所送給我們的大禮，法寶有三，就是大砲聖經和外國貨。</p>
<p>在大砲法寶之下，從鴉片戰爭到九一八一二八，我們所受到的惠德，自香港割讓到灤東戰區，藩屬盡失，版圖變色，截至現在爲止，我們還在喊收復失地。</p>
<p>聖經問題現在好像已有轉移，基督敎從外國敎士手上多數已交給中國信徒，往者已逝，來者可追，現在且按下不表。</p>
<p>外國貨本來是珍奇異品，每年幾萬萬的漏巵會因爲我們服用外國貨而送給人家，不獨會形成我們自己的民窮財盡，或是許多到中國來販貨的外國人都發起財來，據說人家用來打我們的槍砲子彈中，還有我們被壓榨去的血汗在裏面。</p>
<p>這是最合理的算盤，一個日趨窮敗的人家，假如要謀興量，祇有從節儉着手，所謂開源節流是也。以此項原則用來對我們經濟困迫的國家，惟一的辦法，也祇有保固原氣，不使耗喪，換一句話說，不再買外國貨，莫使金錢流於國外。</p>
<p>但是，更進一步的來說，我們日用生活是不會永不求人的，服用各物絕不會不向外面去買，於此，我們更應該曉得治病於去毒以後，更須培養自己的原氣，那末，我們對於本國的生産貨品，應加以愛護和提倡，因爲這是我們自己的基礎，依此才可以達到經濟的收復失地的目的！</p>
<p>准此，在這婦女國貨年的開始，當娘兒們負責幹的時候，我們得先建立了這兩種觀念··</p>
<p>我們爲仠麽要提倡國貨？爲要經濟的收復失地！</p>
<p>我們爲什麽要服用國貨？爲要經濟的收復失地！</p>

<p>父　要買些什麽呢？（手入袋中，如取　　錢狀。）</p>
<p>女　去買些化裝品。</p>
<p>父　（露着驚異的顔色。）化裝品？自己　　製造的不好麽？（手從袋内伸出。）</p>
<p>女　自己製造的只配給工人用，我們怎　　好用？（抅張的神氣。）</p>

<h3>國貨經</h3>
<p>— 許難公</p>
<p>國貨年中用國貨，天經地義莫可破。中國人用中國貨，國運昌隆財亦富。工廠趕把國貨製，品質精良廣銷路。粗製濫造非正途，優勝劣敗有定數。商店販賣國産貨，生意興隆主顧多。改頭換面莫去做，好商走狗終難過。老年人用本國貨，延年益壽家財富。假使購買外貨用，被人目爲老糊塗。太太要用中國貨，多福多壽福氣大。如查買了洋貨用，鐵鳥炸彈成災禍。奶奶服用中國貨，賢母良妻被稱呼。倘若要把外貨用，被人笑駡雌老處。小姐要用國産貨，摩登美麗才時路。誰要購買洋貨用，將來難嫁好丈夫。青年要用中國貨，一心救國莫虛度。如果愛用來路貨，難免要做亡國奴。國人一致用國貨，保國保家保山河。國貨造製勝洋貨，價廉物美花色多。請勿當我吹法螺，經濟侵略害如虎。東北一角山河破，人人須要記清楚。大家趕把國貨用，亡年之牢猶可補。</p>

<p>因爲他山之石，可以攻玉，在這中國婦女國貨年的時候，我們且看看人家的行動如何。夫人小姐，這是小玩意，但望言者無心，聽者有意！</p>
<h3>（二）法國婦女</h3>
<p>孔庸之先生自歐洲考察回來說··［我們莫要誤會法國是一個窮極奢侈的國度，法國農民都是很注重實際的在做。］據我所知道的，巴黎市上所出售的化裝用品，都是道地的［法國製造］就是法國婦女是奢侈的話，香水并未成爲漏巵！</p>
<h3>（三）美國麥酒</h3>
<p>美國酒禁在藍鷹政策之下開放了，然而，美國人所喝的酒，自己製造的麥酒比法國香檳的銷塲大。</p>
<h3>（四）茄寳游法</h3>
<p>神秘女郎茄寶，前次離美返國，道經法蘭西，巴黎商人凖備着做大批生意，結果是未購一物，入寳山空乎而歸，巧妙的法國商品總未曾換得這位瑞典姑娘的金錢。</p>
<h3>（五）日本太太</h3>
<p>據說，日本姑娘遠嫁到中國以後，許多日本太太都還忘不了日本的，（當然也有例外）最明顯的證明，她們會代你佈置一個純粹日本生産用具的家庭</p>
<h3>華達手帕廠改組後之發展</h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>我國自被列强以砲火　閉門户後，繼以經濟侵略，商品之舶，源源而至，我之脂膏，被吮吸迫盡；九一八巨變發生，國勢益危如累卵，再不奮起圖存，縱不滅亡於砲火，抑且滅亡於慢性的經濟侵略矣！粤人王子嘉，蕭貴洪，王玉麟，馬繁，黄欽諸君等，感於天下興亡，四夫有責之義，實行本位救國，於民二十一之秋，集資創辦華達手帕廠於香港，配置新式機器，製造各種手帕，並經在中，英，菲等政府註册，用三羊爲商標。良以手帕一物，雖若甚微，然實爲家常必需之品，社會仕女，莫不人手一方，而究其所自來，　皆外貨也，本國固有之品，製作簡陋，幾無人過問。華達則與外貨同一機製，擷他人之長，本諸科學原理，進而精益求精，原料則取之本國，遂能物美價廉，駕乎舶來以上，開業甫四閱月，銷行已遍於海内外，廠中出品，有供不應求之勢。因而益思淬厲，以香港僻處一隅，祇利於推銷國外，推銷國内，則有未便，且際茲盛倡國貨救國聲中，非具有雄厚之資本，宏大之規模，實不足以抵抗舶來而挽利權，殊有增加股本，改組爲有限公司之必要。經議决擴張後，立卽着手進行，除添置機器，以增加出品量數外，更設支廠於廣州，以利國内推銷。自此營業益形發展，國内則遍銷華　者，國外則南洋，小呂宋，暹羅，新嘉坡等處，靡不呈一種活躍之盛况，該廠猶不自滿，一方於銷行上努力推廣，一方於製造上努力改良，以時代化爲目標，故近日出品，益臻精美。而自稅率增加以來，增重内地採辦者之成本，不免影響銷額，該廠竟不借犧牲，將售價减低，以迂就關稅，銷額轉爲之增加。總之，該廠自擴張改組後，營業之發展，大有一日千里之槪，實爲抵抗外貨之生力軍，若我國其他各業商人，皆有此熱心毅力，從事本位救國，則外貨之絕跡我國市場，誠意中事也。</p>
<h3>婦女國貨年中的兒童年</h3>
<p>— 史濟宏</p>
<p>這差不多誰也知道了的··今年是婦女國貨年而同時又是兒童年，婦女國貨年是要使我們全國的二萬萬女同胞們，都舍了洋貨來改用國貨，這固然不錯，每位摩登妇郎身上的一切外國香水脂粉和最時式的歐美呢絨紗綢，以十六元一千粒槍彈的話，那麽五千子彈是少不了的。</p>
<p>可是話又得說回來，在這婦女國貨年中，做良母和做賢姊的，除了她們自身上和家庭中的服用國貨外，而且還得向着大中華民國未來底主人翁身上去努力，孩子們所穿的用的玩的，十分之九是母親和姊姊們去代他們買的，如果在現在的婦女國貨年中，聰明平親和姊姊，不但爲自己，爲家庭都應該以服用國貨爲原質，並且還得爲自己的孩子們努力購用國貨，訓導他們用國貨，把孩子心中已經先存着愛用洋貨的劣根性剷掉，那麽不但眼前已經不致荒廢了這一個婦女國貨年，抑且在未來的千萬年中替我併避國底孩子們先打了一個愛用國貨的基礎，實在是婦女國貨年聲中的一個大事件。</p>
<p>最後我還得貢獻一些，就是有許多玩具和日用品之類，很應該敎孩子們自己去做，自己去動手，使他們有自立和創造同不折不撓的堅忍的精神，這麽的向兒童方面做去，這一個婦女國貨年纔有眞的意義，此了空口喊着口號，不如要好得多多呀，謹把二句老話做本文的結束。</p>

<h3>國貨的接吻典禮</h3>
<p>— 彰</p>
<p>顧先生兀自的坐在沙發上，嘴裏銜着紙烟，手裏拿着申報，一個兒獨自的一面看報，一面抽烟，好夫人秀文女士。也坐在他的對面，拿着一本最近出版的××週刋在默念着。客堂裏的空氣，異常靜默，只有壁上的時辰鐘，在的滴的滴的走着。</p>
<p>［唉！中國人眞没有辦法，去年是國貨年，非但提倡國家，没有特殊的成績表示出來，却給外貨一個暢銷的機會，據報紙上的記載說··［去年上半年入超約爲四萬七千四百餘萬元，全年約有九萬萬元之巨，我們每個人平均起來，單在外貨方面，要担負二元有餘，唉！這種情形思之能不痛心？但是，可恨的一般婦女們，還自以爲摩登，儘量的去購買外國貨，不顧國家社會與民族之危機，專門在服用外國貨上下工夫，······我們幹國貨運動，提倡國貨救國的人，對於此種情形，除深深地替民族前途歎息外，還有什魔話可說呢？······顧先生說的話，十分憤慨，這憤慨的演說式的語調，頓時衝破了全室沉靜的空氣，把秀文女士也感動了。</p>
<p>［的確，您說的話，一些也不錯，中國若老是樣，國人若老是不覺悟，祇售仰外國貨，而卑視本國貨，則前途的危機，是不可漠視的，而我們婦女界，對於國貨，也應該負有大部份的責任，因爲婦女的大部份是操着全家的經濟權呀······］顧先生的妻子秀文女士順着他的丈夫說，同時，她說到［家庭經濟大部份操在婦女身上一句話的時候，不禁笑了一笑，兩頰紅了一紅，對顧先生望了一望，顧先生也进她笑了一笑，因爲顧先生的家庭經濟，也是操在他的夫人秀文女士之手呀！</p>
<p>［話雖這樣說，但是要一般的婦女共同覺悟起來，却是一件不容易的事呢？所以，我們國貨界的同人，便發了一個狠，把今年定爲婦女國貨年，預備在今年一年之中，專門來做婦女國貨運動的工作，我想，如果一般的婦女能够有了一個共同的覺悟，國貨運動，可說是成功了一大半了，您想對不對嗎？］</p>
<p>［今年是婦女國貨年嗎？好極了，我從今天起，一定來做一個婦女國貨運動的宣傳員，聯合一般的姊妹們，來共同服用國貨，來完成你的苦心，來擔負我的責任，你看，値得實行嗎？］</p>
<p>［那當然是好極了，你如果能站在我一條戰線上，來共同努力於國貨運動的工作，那才不愧爲我的夫人，國貨博士的夫人，［顧先生有國貨博士之别號）今後，我要稱您爲國貨夫人了］</p>
<p>說着，他倆不禁互相微笑起來，在微笑之中，顧先生走近夫人的面前　住了她的腰圍，在秀文女士的面龐上深深地吻了一個甜蜜的長吻，也可以說，［是顧先生和她的夫人宣誓努力國貨運動的典禮。］</p>

<h3>［直譯之故］</h3>
<p>— 作揚靈</p>
<p>偶閱馬叙倫的［讀書小記，］見有這樣的一條··</p>
<p>近人筆記中有繙譯笑話一事，謂華文［馳騁書叢］，英吉利人譯爲［骑馬於書堆裏跑來砲去。］此直譯之過也。然此亦有故實。金學士張鈞爲熙宗草肆赦詔，有［顧茲寡昧］及［眇予小子］語，譯者言［孤獨無親，不懂不事，］［瞎子孩兒］，熙宗以劍釐鈞口而醖之。</p>
<p>只在小時聽父老說過、爲人不當說謊，說謊的人死後到了陰問、要被割舌抽腸。到今日　擔纔知道翻譯出了錯誤，也要被割下兩片嘴唇皮，當作肉醬斫，自己也是偶而弄弄翻譯的人，豈不岌岌乎殆哉！</p>
<p>上面所說的是金朝的故事，那個翻譯家，又是皇帝御用的，所以纔遭那樣的慘禍、七百多年之後且無皇帝的今日，我們本可不必擔憂的了。但看數年來順譯家們攻擊［直譯］或［硬譯］的聲勢，實也可謂洶洶，假使他們一朝權在手，雖不至拿出［以劍釐口而醢之］的手段來，至少是要使［直譯］或［硬譯］不能存在的了。</p>
<p>把［馳騁書叢］譯作［騎馬於書堆裏跑來跑去］，把［眇予小子］譯作［瞎子孩兒］這種譯法，確也可笑而且可惡，但據我看來，這並不是［直譯］或［硬譯］。這是［牛奶路］之類，而［牛奶路］可是［順譯］。馬叙倫先生舉了這樣的例子而說［此直譯之故也］，實在是不對的。</p>
<p>聽林語堂先生說，［大地］的作者勃克夫人全譯的水滸傳已經出版了。林先生正在替好悉心校對，在首幾回中，已發現了一個錯誤，就是把［仁宗朝］的［朝］字，譯成［英吉利］文的［朝見］的［朝］字。這也是很可笑的了，但據林先生說，除此以外實在譯得很好，又非常貴實。而且，勃克夫人正在希望中國的讀者指出她的錯誤，俾得改正。</p>
<p>我以爲翻譯的態度丨丨無論他所主張的是［順譯］或［直譯］［硬譯］丨丨當如勃克夫人，［與其信而不順，不如順而不信］雖是通人的主張，到底也不盡善。至於批評家們，與其指摘出一兩個錯誤，播爲笑談，實不如舉出所有的錯誤，呌譯者改正。</p>
<h3>談地圖變色</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>去年看見日本［改造］雜誌新年號的附錄［最新世界政治經濟地圖］，在那里邊，把我們［中華民國］這塊土直密密地塗着各種顔色的大點子，說那些點子是表示列强的勢力範圍的意思。［滿洲國］當然是跟日本同顔色了。事情總是無獨有偶的，前天某報載，美國的［TheGoography］雜誌十二月號附圖中，將我們怕東北四省塗以紅色，標爲日本領土（與日本同顔色）並印有［滿洲國］字樣；又加拿大Manufactures生命保險公司刋行廣告曆書，書中有世界地圖，將滿洲塗以紅色，我匣塗以黄色。</p>
<p>我是不談國事的人，但因爲提到［滿洲國］，總有點切膚之痛，現在聽說地圖變色，見景生情，不免在心中要流幾點流亡者之涙。</p>
<p>可是我又覺得那些繪地圖的人們，雖是心懷叵測，而在有些地方，却是値得我們欽佩的。常言道··［明人不作暗事。養漢作賊的，能自招出來，我覺得，也可以佩服。我最不喜歡［蓋着蓋兒搖］的人。他們坦坦白白地，表白出來，於我們也是有好處的，那可以使我們自己警惕，清切地了解我們的地位。而那些繪圖的人們，若是站在揭奸的立塲上，那更値得我們感激了。總之，東北的民衆，作了亡國奴是有兩三年了，這是世界週知，而被一部分人所默認了的事實。明明白白地，他們告訴給我們，也省着我們懷疑。我們在地圖上天天看見那些顔色，也可以免得忘記我們在作亡國奴。</p>
<p>我們中國的民衆，是須要知道我們爲什麽到了這步田地，而努力圖謀解救之道的。我以爲我們再不能抱那［家醜不可外揚］的主義。如果早能克服家醜，振作家聲，自然是好的。旣不能克服，而只是把着不揚主義，那能於事有補麽？</p>
<p>我們是需要收復失地的。要那種名譽的國土作什麽？假使東北實際上被日本人佔據着，而地圖上却還塗着中國的顔色，那於我們有什麽好處呢？我們是要我實相符的。我們如何才能收復失地？這才是我們時時要考慮的問題。</p>
<p>登載上面那段新聞的報紙在末尾加着按語道··［此類非法刋物，應行嚴重取締，向關係國交涉禁止也］。我覺得祇要我們把失地收復了，不用我們取締或交涉禁止，那一類地圖自不會再有。祇要我們把那些野心勃勃的侵略國的勢力完全驅逐出去了，我們能够名副其實地獨立起來，那麽那些顔色的點子，就是我們不去交涉，也自會被取消的。可是，得怎樣才能做到呢？這才是我們要問的。</p>
<h3>沈默</h3>
<p>— 繻夫</p>
<p>［沈默是一切最好的表示。吾愛吾愛地私語，尙不是變愛的究竟成就；天乎天乎的呼喚，也還不是表示極大的悲哀。在這些時候的表示應是化石般的死的沈寂。］周作人先生這幾名话道出了哀樂的三味。</p>
<p>予且先生在［飯後的臉］中，對於愛的究竟也有一段很好的描寫。他說，［越是甜蜜越是看不見，越是眞越是看不見。越看不見越甜蜜，越眞越容化，越熱烈。］［這看不清，不看，不能看，不敢看。不應該看，儘管在這刹那，腦内描摹是善是眞是美。不但眞情人如此，就是化裝情人，也是如此。電影表現男女情愛甜蜜之際，他們摟抱着，男的一方是微仰着首，或是看女人的頭髮，用手輕撫着伊，不會對面研究的；而女的最痛快，她索興將兩眼一閉，不獨不看對方，連什麽都不看了。］這與周先生同一見解。</p>
<p>悲哀的這一面，也無例外。我們聽了號淘大哭，並不覺的怎樣難受，最怕的是風雨之夜，遠遠的傳來幽抑清怨的低泣。面像也是一樣，大怒的面顔，並不可怖，令人顫憟的是化石般無所表情的死寂。女人受了委屈就要痛哭，會做丈夫的人，除安慰外，大槪最好讓她哭個痛快罷，哭够了，委屈也消失了。因爲這哭並不是眞的悲哀。無碍衛生。反之，欲哭無涙，想哭而又不敢，那才是天地間的沈痛。又如，思怨罷。坐茶樓酒館的短衫朋友比起穿長衫的來，不獨爽直，並且恩怨也淺得多。他們一語相投，卽同兄弟，二言不合，頓時破臉。但是，勝負一分，仇怨也就釋了，依然兄弟還是一家。長衫朋友則不然，雖是小疵，必加倍報，而上是笑嬉嬉的，心内却比尖刀還陰險。所以眞的恩怨也都是在平淡或笑嬉嬉中顯出；臉紅，氣喘之時，看來雖甚認眞，事過也就忘了。</p>
<p>再說到忿怒。怒髪而至冲冠，自然是達到頂點了。但等到帽子掉在地下，或者自己的氣也醒了。最大的忿怒其實不是髮可冲冠，而是頭上戴了一個千斤的石鼎，使你忿怒不能表出，只得變爲冷冷的抗議。</p>
<p>冷冷的忿怒才是眞的忿怒。我們在過去的童養媳的臉上，南店學徒的臉上，丫環女僕的臉上，殖民地奴隷的臉上，總之，一切戴着石鼎的奴隸的臉上，都可發見。</p>
<p>他們都變爲沉默，化石般的死寂。但他們並未死，仍在反抗。一個民族，一國臣民有時也陷於這種狀况，這是最偉大的忿怒</p>
<h3>韋爾斯的預言：一九三五年中日大戰記（續）</h3>
<p>— 孟眞</p>
<p>爲懲戒日本，各國的行動，直到此時，纔行明白。不僅歐美的軍械工廠曾以潛艇水雷等出售，各國的海軍也以節約經費的理由，將其新式軍器，拆成零件，運至南美智利方面，再由智利到馬尼剌，然後秘密交與中國。菲律賓羣島這樣無異中國潛艇的根據地，使日本的海上交通，大受威脅。日本看到了這種形勢，遂不顧條約，在南洋各島，增築潛艇的根據地。美國艦隊爲了保護菲島的中立，集中於關島，日本軍艦則爲封鎖中國海岸，而集中於中國海上。這時日美戰爭雖未開火，但西太平洋的形勢，已非常緊張。因爲防止運軍火至中國，一九三六年時，有美國潛艇二艘，在中國海上爲日本所擊沉。日本的潛艇亦時時出現於關島附近。於是到了一九三七年，美日兩國，在西太平洋遂發生非正式的海戰。</p>
<p>但是兩國都不發布宣戰布告。羅斯福二世以其經濟政策的冒險的結果，財政陷於非常的困境。日本也正竭其全力以事打擊中國心臟的遠征。此時，美國的保守主義者忽然心機一轉，爲了發散國内的不平，亦主張對日宣戰。主張重新併有菲島。待至日本的武昌遠征失敗，於是美國對日作戰論，遂一發而不可制了。</p>
<p>關於這次美日戰爭，時間很短，也不是最後的决戰，所以從略。兩國在太平洋的遭遇戰，只經過二天，日本方面以彈藥告盡，最後乘着黄昏，撤了烟幕，便退却了。日本這樣把海上戰線，讓給潛艇，主力艦隊則退入有魚雷設備的港口，因爲物質缺乏，不復出現於海上了。反之，美國艦隊乘這機會，遂威風堂堂地開至馬尼剌，宣布海戰勝利。</p>
<p>此時，日美兩國的國内狀况，都趨於非常惡化，這使二國都難於繼續作戰，所以這次日美戰爭是並未有過决戰而中止，也没有什麽和約之類。日美兩國都以國内的崩潰形勢，不得不各自忙於社會的故革。</p>
<p>第二年，卽一九四零年，戰爭的局面，轉到歐洲太陸。這次大戰的結果，便全歐大陸都化爲焦土。當時記錄，現在是已一點也没有遺留了。世界唯一的，最後的戰紀，便是從武昌退却時一個日本軍官的軍營日記，但是零碎斷片，没有系統，不過我們從這當中，仍可以想見那時燒殺之慘，實在令人不忍卒讀。這個軍官，大槪是死在開封的。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×</p>
<p>以上便是韋爾斯關於遠東戰事的夢話，至於歐洲方面戰事的預言，好在可從原書見到，並且這裏的篇幅也不許我這樣拉長的說下去，所以就此擱筆了。（完）</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>

<p>陸醉米太太和博齊汝船長都轉過身去；兩個划槳的也把槳停住不划了；紙有羅蘭媽媽毫不動彈。</p>
<p>鉅大的郵船被一雙在它面前彷彿蛹蟲那麽渺小的强有力的拖船拖着，慢慢地，威風懍懍地，走出了港口。擁擠在岸上，砂灘上，窗永口上的哈佛爾羣衆，突然被一種愛國心鼓舞着，狂喊着··［洛蘭勒萬歲！］對於這豪壯的出發，這給海産下了一個蝚漂亮的女兒的近海大城的分娩，不禁歡呼喝彩起來。可是這郵船呢，等它一經穿過那用兩道花崗石牆壁圍成的仄狹的通路，終於覺得自由了時，便立刻把它的拖船抛棄了，像一個在水面奔走着的大怪物似的，獨自走了。</p>

<h3>南北米市趨勢稍異</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源四十餘號、（五千餘石）、晚稻約占其半、而包胃去路、客家叫盤雖緊、尙見暢旺、中關晚稻見秀、高者大都上棧、故無榮辱、統計共去宫帮及上棧有三千餘包、各帮厚粳店胃稍活、市色略挺、杜洋尖無甚上落、陰變元亦見帶秀、</p>
<p>（滬北）各路到埠二十六七號、市上各貨去路平常、白粳·白元·洋杜埠客尖·早薄稻價平疲、陰元小角外、</p>
<h3>客秈續漲六七分</h3>
<p>粤省回出湘靖米</p>
<p>昨日客秈本客胃口均活、到頭不多、去化甚旺、市面步砌、昨閩帮最貪、本街與寗波胃口亦佳、貨主喊高一角、結果比间市大六七分、統市由福州辦去湖南機紅米七百包、價六元六角二分至五角二分、糙紅二百六十五包、價五元五角半、明光機米五百五十包、價六元四角半、又甬帮辦去江西早糙二百七十七包、價五元、湖南機油五百包、明光糙米二百包、本街去湖南機油一千餘包、價六元九角四分至五角半、明光糙米二百多包、價五元三角半、蕪湖機元米一百包、價七元半、</p>
<p>福州帮白滬閩航運　復後、辦　　颔、惟市上　　、兩　　又喴高、未能　　辦　、　州帮昨亦到市問訊、因其日　　船開放、大約卽有辦　　、</p>
<p>昨日本街辦進各秈外、又向　帮裕豐號購回機器靖米一千包、價祇六元零二分、此價照市便宜、因該米原係粤省政府向湘省直接辦裝、裝粤後不合該地銷胃、乃又退滬求脫、故行情售小數角、爲本街　户合進云、</p>
<h3>黄荳大漲小回</h3>
<p>昨日豆市忽起變化、市價撳小二三分、實因四五日内、已見提升二角外、前日又突被福州市放價近角、致一般貨永一味硬扳、所以昨市各帮辦胃頓時淡落、全市共成交五六車、計本街去正陽關豆二車、價開三元六角至五角、廠家去頴州豆二車、扯三元四角三、信陽州豆一車、價爲三元三角半、内地辦去歸德豆六百包、做三元五角二至五角、出口未有問訊者、糖市</p>
<h3>國産青糖又漲三四角</h3>
<p>丨丨粗砂白亦見轉機丨丨</p>
<p>昨糖市以關金見增、而荷滙轉縮、趨勢回好、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨呌十九元、好起三分、高貨十九元一角、轉口貨升五分、爲六元三角半、荷赤升五分、九號十五元四角半、八號十五元二角、轉口貨升四分、爲六元八角、太古糖升半角、Ｂ嘜爲十九元五角半、ＣＷ嘜十九元四角、潮青因地價轉升、銷路漸旺、昨開出一千六百餘包、提莊青爲十二元七八角至十二元六角、次之十一元八角、此前盤漲起三角、漳刁青開百餘包、價爲十二元、升起四角、振記本廠綿白無更動、一號十七元九角、餘照退、各本廠冰漲一角、一號爲二十二元八角、二號二十二元七角、五金</p>
<h3>五金定價飛漲</h3>

<h3>日用品商塲的槪述（三）溪南</h3>
<p>對於蔬食食講的話太多了，尙且没有說得透澈，人家或許疑我爲素菜館作宣傳。那是　對不然。不過話要說回來，開素菜館的，都是吃素信佛的人，可是我們有時到素菜館去，　則不能說是心然，而且爲各種吃食店的通病，但是仍舊要［欺生］。假使我們問幾位大居士。如王黄許屈諸位先生中之任何幾位去，也許是偶然，然而所吃的菜，好像比一般的特别些。此本是不足爲奇，對待老主顧，應該比一二次的新主顧爲優待。不過彔菜館旣然信佛的人辦的，應本［我佛平等］之旨，不分新舊，一說同仁，才可說［肉食者鄙］而蔬食者確能泯除［人我之見］了。</p>
<p>趁此機會，還有幾句話要說，就是素菜館中小菜，往往要用葷菜的名稱，而加一［素］字以别之，如素鷄素鴨火腿素鴨火腿薰鵝素魚翅之類。在館中人的意思，或者便於吸引吃葷的人嘗試起見。但是在我看來、旣然一心吃素，何以心不忘葷，還要件件用葷菜名詞來稱謂。因此記得鄕間有一句譏誚吃素人的話，說是［假吃三官（素）望十六］。如果彔小菜仍用輩名詞，那不是有如［假吃三官素］麽？</p>
<p>我們再回轉頭來　看苦力的吃品，如果是念佛的人，當然要念一句［阿彌陀佛］，實在太可憐了。但是還没有看到鄕間的人，連這一點尙没有甚至每天喝不着一粒米糝，挺起胸膛喝西北風，與上海的苦力相形之下，可說還在天堂之上，一則眞在餓莩地獄之中了。我們有時吃了飯出去在馬路上逛，往往看到小　三，見來往的送飯担，挑了殘菜剩飯回去，卽一擁上前，不問情由，將他担中所　的菜，所餘的飯，一顆腦兒，傾入他的齷齪不堪的鉛桶鐵罐内。他們拿到了這許多菜與飯，固然要去供獻給老　三，及自己吃食之外，如果有餘的，還得要出賣。有時走過磨坊街，就可以看見這種情形。而且磨坊街竟爲此開設幾家飯店，也可以說是［苦力飯店］，這一種店家能賣的小菜，大槪是小菜塲上大家不要買的物，以及各館子客人吃餘的乘餚殘羹，七拼八凑的［八寶和合菜］（這是我替他取的名詞）此外如民國路人行道上，亦不少此等苦力的［臨時食堂］。又凡是黄包車停車塲所，有一種江北婦女，一手携了一把大白鉛水壼，一手携了一桶（或籃）食物，水壼中盛滿了開水（或茶），桶中所盛的爲　子油條大餅之類。黄包車夫一手持餅，一乎持水盌，坐在車梗上，過其喘息甫定之充飢生活。如果有客人雇車，他們又是三口兩嚼，拖了車子，拚命的跑了，那裏還有咀嚼的機會。</p>
<p>上海這個地方，已經弄到祇講究吃着講究白相的地步了。每天早晨看見倒［狗嚼鉢頭］的人，盈桶滿担，從各個弄堂中挑出去，裏面不少的白飯，拿去喂猪吃。尤其是有許多人家往往將當天吃剩的菜與飯，娘姨大姐到了都市，也忘記了本來面目，望狗嚼鉢頭中一倒。再不想想，一粒米從田中到你的肚裏，可以說是千辛萬苦，並不容易。嘗記得某書中所載某相國在位時，剩飯飯滓，俱棄於溝中，隨流出外，有某僧見之，良不忍，乃從溝中拾取，漂凈跴乾以充食，尙多餘積。某的，相國以事敗，田廬盡没官。寄食僧寺。僧仍以所拾取積存者爲食。相國食之甘，訽其所來，僧卽以實告，相國爲之憮然。因此我想上海的人家，假使想到某相國下塲，食其昔日所啌棄之物而甘之，同一人焉，前後之判若是，也應該稍稍惜食的了。　　（上年十二月二十九日續）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>文人女性化</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>自古文人多弱質，［投筆從戎］作糾糾武夫所謂文武全村者很少，因此文人在英雄好漢的眼底，［狀類婦人女子，而聖明與昏庸的天子陛下，便常有所謂侏儒者唱詩跳舞以供娛樂。這一種侏儒卽是文人，其後倡優，伶官，代有英才，實則已經成爲文奴，等於六宮粉黛之流。不過孔子雖然招徒敎學，實非文人，詩書禮樂之外，並授騎射，他的學生子路學生子路學了［十八般武藝］以勇稱；魯侯至郢會齊侯，孔子且揮動利劍挺身保駕，威震遐邇；其後由秦而漢，［重文輕武，一而文人這才遍於天下，只懂搖動筆　兒，不會要槍揮劍了。唐朝李世民，選翰林院一班文人組織戲班，梨園裏頭的文人等於戲子伶官，文人［狀類婦人女子］這時最爲時髦　因此文人自古已經女性化的也，就有史可查。［古已有之。］</p>
<p>天津報載四川内江的文化書店的經理傳運蓮，年約四旬，曾經留學日本，歷任中學校長敎員，學問淵博　大有名士風度，年來喬裝女服，普施脂粉，在家出外，均作女裝，全城人士都說他是［人妖。］我想四川這位［文人］傅先生，旣然是［學問淵博，］而且［大有名士風度，］大槪是痛世風之日下，哀三道之淪亡，現身說法，祖述古人，說他是［人妖］者簡直是破壞文化復興。運動的反動份子。當今之世，舉凡政學道德，只要是［古已有之］的國粹，上倡下和，文化復興，國家的富强，指日可待，傅先生的［喬裝女服，並施脂粉］，亦屬［古已有之］的國粹道德，理合呈請褒獎，以成風俗，才是愛國之道。而且，有人主張［這位但願生爲女兒身的傅文人倒是頗足取法的。］其理由說是［我國的文人最多，歷史上一套奪的治亂興亡，都有自命不凡的文人從中作崇，貽害蒼生，筆難罄書。倘使日前的文人，都像傅先生那樣裝腔作態，抺指塗粉，都能像傅先生那樣　　婷婷地女性化起來，便没有造謠或衆，忘評是非的野心家與硬骨漢，一切不待統制，而能長治久安。］這對於文人女性化的大舉，更覺得行不容緩的了。</p>
<h3>致媽</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>媽！雖然你終是我的媽··</p>
<p>在這樣的情况下，母女間偉大的愛以什麽來維持呢？媽！我心中眞是萬分的納罕，爲什麽我竟連這天地間最最偉大不朽的慈母之愛的滋味都嘗不到呢？媽！請你萬分地原諒我丨丨你的女兒今天所說的一切什麽話，都是出心靈，萬分不得已的。</p>
<p>媽！人類是屬於社會，應該爲社會而生，爲社會而死，人固然是私人生育的，但是生育以後就不是個人的私産了，這點，媽！希望你認清呀！但是媽！你錯了，你以爲一個女子或兒子除了孝敬父母，所謂［孝感動天］者外其他什麽都可以不問不聞的。媽！這又是那裏的話呢？我們正需要去幹更重大的事情，重大的任務，正期待着我們青年的去担哪。我們要抛去［小我］的自私自利的觀念，而去實行［大我］爲公衆的益利而奮鬥的工作。我要這樣的去幹，於是，媽，在你的目光下我就成了是忤逆女兒了。</p>
<p>但是，媽啊，這話說出去，不是很罕聞的嗎？做母親的爲了祇度自己的幸福，面把兒子們的終身大事，置之不問的不說，還要加以阻止和破壞嗎？媽！你處處佈下了羅網，要你的女　去投入，難道　是你忍心的嗎？這倒　呌我難於相信了。</p>
<p>媽，到今天總結，我已忍　在　　在暴虐之鞭下過了二十五年的生活了，媽喲，你的女兒再不能那樣的懦弱待斃了。</p>
<p>這是不幸中的大幸，我總算挨到高中畢了業，其實在這經濟磞壞，市業蕭條的現在，出洋回國的留學生，國内著名大學裏的大學生，失業而餓着肚子的多着呢？何况我這樣一個區區高中畢業的弱女子呢。幸見，十方設計，謀得了一個職員的地位，唉！媽！其餘的女同事們，她們今天穿紅明天着綠，粉白黛黑，亭亭玉立，誰不愛她們呢？因此對於我這個安份守己，衣衫襤褸的傷心人，當然要加以冷眼，和侮視了，在外界侮辱說我們職員們是［花瓶］因爲她們我倒又無法抵抗而竟無條件的默認了。呵！媽！何何嘗知道，我就是每天在這樣的處境下過活的呀··所以我這每月二十元錢的工錢是我内心的鮮血犧牲的代價呀！我相信，我的工錢上會有血的腥氣，滲透了汗的臭味。可是呀！你又時時蔑視我，說給我讀到高中畢業，也不過賺幾元錢一月，說我還不如投身銀幕的女人，甚至駡我連比站在街頭當妓女的都不如！啊，媽啊，我今天總得問你了，你是不是下了决心要你親生的骨肉在寒風冷雪的街頭站着當妓女呢？······</p>
<p>媽，再也不心諱言了？你是過份自　了，然而你　太變幻莫測了　像你這樣朝三暮四，我是不到永遠不會了解你的心的。</p>
<p>來　對　　當毫無理由的痛咒和漫駡，固然原因是爲我認識了一個品格嚴正的男友，但這總未免太慘酷了些！媽，在互相尊重人格的條件之下，社交原是能够公開的，卽使進一步的說有了愛的關係，甚而就成爲伉儷，這也是件光明磊落的事情，國家由社會組織而成，社會由家庭組織而成，所以我們要改革當先從單位的家庭改革起，這是合理的行動呀！······</p>
<p>媽！我知道了，你以爲我有了些知識，能够自立生活了，并且每月還總算能够拿給你，雖然呌你不能滿意的幾塊錢，你就私心滿足而忍心呌你的女兒孤單單地了此一生嗎？一切别的什麽，我們都不去問它了。我首先要問的，就是我們稍具知識的女子，是否應該依賴男子，過着寄生着的生活？敎育子女是否光　爲着考敬父母的那種自私的利益？媽，我請你先回答我這些。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，一陣陣的愴痛從心坎上浮起來，媽，什麽我都再不能寫了······</p>
<h3>環境與人生</h3>
<p>— 建設</p>
<p>丨呈閱本刋的學生讀者丨</p>
<p>我常想，拿破崙之所以爲拿破崙，環境不是無因的。</p>
<p>世界上有許多事物，可惜很少有人注意，要不然，一定可在那些平庸的事態裏，發現多少有益的東西。比如我們經常是很少注意到自己的環境，我們常是漠視它，覺得實没有什麽可注意的地方，最多它不過存在於模糊之間而已。</p>
<p>一不經意便總接不近事理的實態，所以卽管有好處，也總是輕易地忽略了它，這，實是可惜的事。</p>
<p>好像我們讀書，總覺得在敎室裏也是讀，在自修室也是讀，在圖書館也是讀。不過假使我們細細的想起來，則我們定可得出一個大大的分别來。敎室通常總是授課的，授課的時間雖然看得書，介總不免分心，卽使一個怎樣不願聽講的人，然而總有講書的聲音攪擾不寗，這，比起在自修室裏着，可就差得多了。自修室通常規定是作業的，但是禁不住仍有談話哂笑的聲音，或者有種吟咏的嘈雜，這，若比起在那規定祇許靜靜地看書，不容稍有聲氣的圖書館裏，無疑的又要差得多了。</p>
<p>這各種不同的讀書的地方，就是各種不同的讀書的環境。</p>
<p>因爲環境之不同，作業的效率也就當然互異。</p>
<p>讀書是這樣，我們知道交友也是這樣。</p>
<p>比如，一般的講起來，專講球術的也是朋友，專講吃喝的也是朋友，專講讀書的也是朋友。若我們曾是過來人，就很知道這其間有着截然不同的影響。玩球的大都是任性的，氣燥的，理性總是不大管事，驕傲却很特出。和這種人混在一夥，第一點就會把書本丢在一邊，一味的只講些體育的，或者是女人的事。第二點便是任意閙事情，感情成爲一身的主宰，理智看做是　子的事。若和專講吃喝的混在一塊，聽的只是一些人生的享樂的調子，看的盡是一些浪漫的行動，於是結果，自己便也會任性的放浪起來，說不定弄得自己没有下局。若是和愛講讀書的弄在一塊，自己卽管是怎樣懶惰的，可是一看見人家早也是讀，晚也是讀，談起話來總是叙述着，辯論着這一個那一個的問題，自己也會怎樣都禁不信要讀一點，日子一久，沾染漸深，知道智識的探求有種無窮的樂味，便怎樣都難得抽着身去接近那般不讀書的人們，而使自己受着他們那壞的沾染了。</p>
<p>這一羣羣不同的人們，也就是種種不同的環境。環境不同，一個人的人品，一個人的將來，也就會異轍殊途。</p>
<p>所以一個人總要注意到自己的環境，因爲環境是能奪定我們的前路，我們知道注意它，我們就知道選擇它，知道選擇它，我們就知道部份的謀我們的將來的解决。歷史上孟母擇鄰這故事，確實是値得我們注意的事情。</p>
<h3>一九三四年的［推背圖］</h3>
<p>— 慈</p>
<p>自從一位洋著作家（？）發表了一篇對於第二次世界大戰［推背圖］式的驚人預言之後，預言這玩意兒，竟成了時下搖筆桿的月友們最時髦的藝術了！什麽日中戰爭，日俄戰爭，日美戰爭······都成了預言家預言的最好題材。他們把未來的事變描寫得有聲有色，淋漓盡致，大有［不對不要錢］之慨。猗歟盛哉，［推背圖］之復活於今日焉！</p>
<p>其實，［推背圖］式的預言，乃是我們黄胄華夏的國粹，那位洋著作家偸竊其一部份，如法泡氰的做了一篇第二次世現代名人書畫（張叔通作）</p>
<p>界大戰的預言，浩浩蕩蕩地傳佈到中國來，居然成了不折不扣的［來路貨］，引得我們這班愛用洋貨慣了的摩登朋友，爭相贊譽，爭相效法，以致國粹掃地，洋汽冲天，劉伯温地下有知，豈不活活氣死？</p>
<p>據說，劉伯温的［推背圖］，對於［世界大事］的預言，的確有說不出來的妙處，較著［來路貨］不啻有天壤之别。可知中國的精神文明，决非以物質文明自豪的歐美諸國，所能望其項背，區區忝爲黄胄之後裔，深得劉伯温［推背圖］的奥妙，目覩人心之不師古，國粹之漸淪亡，所以不惜洩漏天機，作此一九三四年的［推背圖］以爲抵制；非敢依附潮流，亂出風頭，皇天后土，實所共鑒也！是爲跋。</p>

<h3>人人得而誅之</h3>
<p>編輯先生；</p>
<p>我是個青年男子，無理的舊禮敎，和貞操等，我是都不信仰的，我於上月和Ｗ女士結了婚；發覺好並不是處女了。因爲我們是精神上的戀愛，對於她的處女不處妇，本没有關係。但好自動的告訴我，說我不得不告訴你了，初時我也爲着慚愧不願說出·但是我再不說出，就没有人知道我的事情，非但太對不起你，那惡魔也無人會去除了！我是去年給一個男同事强姦的！他！他！他不强姦我一個人，他前後竟强姦了六七個人，爲了我們少女，都怕羞不肯聲張，他就無情無義的去······。唉！在我之前是×女士；在我之後，是×女士；現在又是×女士，都是給他一見就連姦幾次的。當時我不能抵抗，在在眞對不起你。唉！還有她們也是弱者，不知以後怎樣去做人呀。好這樣說了一長篇，氣得我是恨不得把那獸物殺了。</p>
<p>現在我是想進行懲戒了這禽獸，我的主意是要告他的强姦罪。未知如何是好？更不知證據方面，只内子一人足否？我不帶民訴，不要求倍償。編輯先生，怎樣最好呢？清天白日，竟會有這種人人得而誅之的敗類，怎敎我們能忍受得呢！他强姦我的愛人，我想想是更怒不可言。</p>
<p>編輯先生，你無論怎樣忙，請你答覆我。或是請你給我一個時間地點，和我談談；因爲我平日見你報上的答覆，極使我佩服和信仰。　　你了要辜負了我的熱望呀！再會了，</p>
<p>祝你的一切勝利！</p>
<p>陳明（海寗路五一七號）</p>
<p>編者按··陳君的確是一個思想澈底的新青年，他並不以把他妻子被强姦一事張揚開去爲可恥，而採取一種私自報復的手段；他能够澈底了解這伯事情責任之誰屬，而主張置對方於法。第一不致使他的妻子，在被人蹂躪之後，再受無枉的委曲。第二他自己可以避免因私鬭而所冒的危險。第三他還能替社會做一椿懲一儆百的壯舉。我們極端贊成他取這種手段，並且很希望他早日勝利，人心大快。查現行刑法，首重物證，而人證次之；在告發之前，應注意於物證的搜集；萬一並無物證，那麽對於人證方面，務須有充份的凖備，能聯絡×女士×女士等，同時告發最好。至於你要親來面談一層，固所歡迎，請於每日下午五六時間，駕臨大陸商塲三四五號可也。</p>

<p>當犯人出獄去挑水，都用一條鐵鏈兩個人一對的攬腰鎖着丨丨我想這種時候是任人都會懂得應該做什魔的吧！</p>
<p>現今全世界的人都被鎖着，却似乎還有一部分人不知道要做什麽。</p>

<p>從前在西監看見志戴把鉛律尖削得很尖，我很不開心，以爲他太奢侈了。那鉛筆是我的。</p>
<p>這裏的鉛筆是工塲裏作弊來的，或者請看守用重價私買來的。如何困難在我們要一枝鉛筆的時候呀！</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>

<h3>在蘇聯拍取影片</h3>
<p>— 炳颺</p>
<p>美蘇復交，已成爲目前國際上最引人注意的一個問題。在這個普遍復交聲中，許多同情蘇聯的美國人都在爲這件事奮力奔波。許多人最近都遄往蘇聯去調查政治，經濟，文化以及一切情形··在最近我們又得到一個美國攝影隊到蘇聯去拍取影片的消息，茲特譯出，以供來日中國電影界向外發展的參考。</p>
<p>該攝影隊係由三個美國人組成的。這三個人對於蘇聯都具有熱烈的同情。費爾得（Ｗ·Ｏ·Ｆield）和比佫魯（Ｌ·Ｋ·Ｂiglow）兩人對於旅行的，敎育的以及其他種種形式的電影製作都有相當豐富的經騐。費爾得並用曾經到過蘇聯兩次去拍攝靜片和電影。另外的一個小維斯勞君（Ｊ·Ｒ·ＷithrowJr·）在帮忙攝影以外，還從事於研究和管理的工作。</p>
<p>下面是費爾得對［莫斯科新聞］記者的談話··［我們到這裏（指莫斯料）來的目的，是企圖把蘇聯目前的一些有意義的發展情况用影片來介紹給美國的電影觀衆。在我們的影片裏，我們想盡可能地把蘇聯的幾種主要的社會的經濟的情形很清晰地貢獻出來，並且想解番這些情形的背景，他們之所以成功的原故以及他們在目前的意義。</p>
<p>［我們之所以要到此地來攝取這些影片的原因有三··第一，想在美國刺激起對於蘇聨的更清楚和更深刻的瞭解、第二、想鼓勵蘇聯與美國人民間的友誼的態度；第三，想在國際合作上予以更有力的支持。我們以爲像我們這樣地製作影片，在完成如上的旨趣的塲合上是有着重大的價値的，因爲採取了這樣的方式，正可以迎合美國電影觀衆的心理。這正如美國的獻院常常採取這種方式一樣，可以在美國博得廣大的宣傳。］</p>
<p>當談到他們此後的計劃的時候，費爾得說··［因了此後莫斯科的天氣將一天一天轉壞的關係，我們就决定轉到高加索去。我們之所以選擇高加索，是因爲牠是特别精彩美麗的地方並且牠可以代表中世紀的文化與今日社會經濟的昂揚作一個顯明的對比的。</p>
<p>［我們希望能到達格斯敦（Ｄaghestar）的幾個地方旅行一下··然後，如果環境許可的話，我們將去卡開夏（Kakhetia），開夫修雷夏（Khevsuratia）和奥色夏（Ｏssetia）的幾個地方去參觀。在蘇聯的最有趣味的新發展中，我們所最樂於記錄的，也許是希育上的驚人進步以及牠近年以來在向着一個更高級的生活水凖前進過程中的收獲。對於在以前売全無人注意的地帶之道路的敷設和電力設計，我們也要注意。］</p>
<p>該攝影隊已於九月十日離莫斯科赴高加索，他們將在高加索留住六個星期以便從事拍取影片之第一部。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評［義僕奸朋］</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Day　of　Reckoning</p>
<p>一般的說，倫理片很容易引起人們深切的情感，這由於父子夫妻之間的關係，每一個人都有深切的理解，因此，以自身的體念來對照影片中的情感，常發生眞切之感；假使作者在情感方面確是非常豐富的話。</p>
<p>在中國，人道主義的［人道］能够吸收極大的觀衆，便是顯明的例證。</p>
<p>我們很懇切的說··［人道］的作者在［人道］中所表現出來的，完全是陳舊的觀念形態，此後在［母性之光］中也没有看到［新的人與人之間的關係］。同樣，［義僕奸朋］的作者，也只是以極陳腐的理解，來處理愛情如友誼，更連帶表揚僕人對於家主的忠義。</p>
<p>譚約翰因負債而入獄，判徒刑二年。其妻因營求丈夫與生活艱困而求助於丈夫之友人霍令斯。於是霍令斯因貪色暗使譚約翰下獄之後復奪其妻。是時，祇有譚家之女僕盡力照拂她的兩個小主人。不久，譚妻因戀霍，致遭霍之另一情婦之槍擊，身死，而霍亦入獄。在獄</p>
<p>中，好友成仇，譚卒將霍令斯置之死地。譚出獄後，深謝女僕。</p>
<p>在這個故事中我們我探討出來的主題是··不能共患難而且不貞的妻子應死，奸淫朋友之妻者，亦應死，而忠直的丈夫雖臨於危難，仍當超生。至於忠心的僕人自然更應得好的結果。作者是極力維護舊道德人倫之存在的，特别是探取果報主義的方法來結束每個劇中人的一生，更覺脆弱與庸俗。</p>
<p>假使站在新的觀點上來說，那末經濟環境規定了每人的行爲，奸淫友人之妻固不是道德二字所能解决，特别是妻子因生活而意識薄弱的移愛於另一男人，决不是如何了不起的罪過。至於寫女僕竭盡綿力的，扶有主人之小孩，更使人發生生疏之感。</p>
<p>作者對於這一故事的處理，我覺得最精采的地方，便是以獄中的友愛之誠懇來此擬霍令斯，這是比較適富的方法。</p>
<p>就演出來說，導演最欠缺的是情感的不够。我們在某種情形之下，固然反對無謂的傷感，然而導演CharlesR·Brabin，在如此陳腐的主題之下，還没有强調情感之成份，可見他創造力的確不够。</p>
<p>此外，導演在整理故事方面，却見清順。更可取的是對於霍令斯，並不過份的誇張他的醜惡。對於其他的人物，都任其自然的發展。不，說得正確一點，他不寫所謂壞的過份的壞，所謂好的亦不過份的使人同情。這固然不運用戲劇上的誇張，否則，將因其誇張而加强舊觀念之毒害了。這樣說，似乎是表現方法法不够的好處了。一笑。</p>
<p>有幾個塲面是應當特别指出的。當譚約翰在牢中窗口看見自己之孩子的時候，他悲苦而狂歡的喊··［他已經會走了，他已······］。此外譚約翰在獄中知道了友人之無恥，而大呼［他就是我的朋友呀！······］繼之以瘋狂大笑。凡此，都是導演得心應手之處。</p>
<p>主角李却狄克斯（ＲichardDix）在上述的二塲中，的確演得非常好的。然而也就是這一點功績而已，其他均甚平平。在配角當中，亦無特别可愛的，飾女僕的UnaMarke一比較自然。</p>
<p>關於李却狄克斯。對於中國觀衆似科不常見面。就我所知道的，他主演的片子很多，有［女性改造］，［光榮的愚者］，［濁流］，［愛的光輝］，［出賣了的靈魂］，［貧窮之福］，［戰友之妻］，［天國罪人］，［死綫上］，［球王］，［愛慾之轍］，［滿蒙馬隊］等片。其中有許多未至中國。以［十誡］給人印象最深。</p>
<p>關於這一影片，假使寫幾句總括的評語，那應當是不好亦不壞，舊型的作品中之水平上的影片罷了。</p>
<h3>聯華三廠的新片攝製</h3>
<p>聯華三廠，朱石麟編導之［歸來］在南京首都影院放映時，連日客滿，輿論極佳。現此片已爲上海新建築之金城大戲院商得在滬首次公演之權，該廠，繼［歸來］後攝製之新片，爲朱石麟編楊小仲導演之［良宵］，同時，爲努力增加生産供應社會需要起見，故又拍製喜劇兩部，一爲［徵婚］，由大胖子殷秀岑主演，一爲沈哀鵑所編之劇本，暫名［街頭人］由劉繼羣韓蘭根合作。［徵婚］輕靈巧妙］，頗饒情趣，［街頭人］爲一涙染的喜劇。劇中人物，爲兩個流浪者，一個孤兒和一個以洗衣爲生的祖母，還有一個房東和房東的使女。這兩部喜劇因非常品不特爲三廠特製片，且將爲國産喜劇片創一新紀錄云。</p>
<h3>孫導演甄拔的新人材</h3>
<p>不能否認各方面人材都感缺乏的中國影界，聯華是最注重造就新人才的公司，而孫瑜却爲聯華中對人材特别努务甄拔的第一人。在他的近作［體育皇后］中，男的他物色了久困於小公司的張　爲主角，女的，對王默秋王　給予以優越的地位，使他們足以發展天才之外，還甄拔了兩個從未上過鏡頭的女演員殷虛和白鷺，這兩個新人材雖然都未上過鏡頭，但天賦的表演才能給導演諄諄善誘地指導啓宗，她們的光芒便開始顯露，留在底片上的印象，有很好的成績。據孫導演說她們必將一鳴驚人，雖然說不到什麽新發現······等等的誇大推崇，但是獲得一九三四年中華影界演員的優越地位是無疑的。我們等着看吧。</p>
<h3>大胖子殷秀岑得頭獎</h3>
<p>在航空獎券售賣的期間，差不多每人至少都要買上一條。花錢旣不多僥倖却可發財且能輔且航空建設何樂而不爲？所以獎券每期的銷售都是十分踴躍了。聯華的同人，當然也少不得買的。在第三期開獎的時候，雖然大獎有的只得到頭獎的尾字，但是大家並不失望却欣然一笑。</p>
<p>開獎過去的和些天，殷胖子慌張跑到一廠了，但他跑來慌張，同費穆談話的時候却偸偸摸摸的像有什麽秘密，不久，殷秀泉得頭獎的消息傳出了。當然大家都要看看他那條獎券，立時大家都流露着特殊的目光向他要求，但他竟不承認，可是終於被大家看見他的那條獎券了。不錯，正是三一三八一七，當人們都包圍着讓他請客時，他却捧腹大笑了。原來這個頭獎的號碼，他是從旁的獎券剪下貼凑在一起的。大家細看了看，果眞上了胖子的當了。</p>

<h3>歌壇雙絕TheCatandtheFiddle(九)</h3>
<p>— 墨塵</p>
<p>維克多惶然地道··［你不讓你的夫人登臺，那個戲不就拆臺了嗎？］奥黛蒂的丈夫道··［戲？那是完了。］他又回過頭向着奥黛蒂道··［怎麽樣？想停當了没有。不過你要曉得，無論你想怎樣，我是决不再爲那個戲投資的了。］奥黛蒂臉上顯着爲難的樣子。心想要是她的丈夫不出錢，那戲是不會成功的。她很想重登舞臺，享受成功的光榮，但是失敗了，還有什麽享受呢？於是這位久慣於安逸奢侈的奥黛蒂，不能不投降了。她對她太夫道··［怎麽啦，我愛，當然我是跟你加去的。］</p>
<p>維克多看着他們走了。錢可以能神，那老頭子更加自信他的法力無邊了，因爲這時奥黛蒂已經拉着他的臂，緊緊地靠着他，美麗的臉仰着向他媚笑着。等他們走了，維克多覺得他的成功，好像一塲夢似的消逝了，隨之而消逝的，還有贏得先莉的希望。過了一回他突然地又鼓起了勇氣，决計背城借一，奮鬭到底，他將全班的演員召集了，重新演習起來。他吩咐他的助手，立卽去找一個女主角，呌他將全巴黎尋遍了，一定要找來，因爲他的小歌劇，明天一定要出演的！</p>
<p>到了明天的早晨，巴黎的全城都談着這件事，當做新鮮笑話講。並且有人將這件事和先莉講了，並且告訴她說，非但女主角走了，並且男主角亦跟着跑了。因此他現在自已做男主角，另外還要尋一個女主角。並且奥黛蒂的丈夫旣不肯再墊欵，那戲就不會有成功的希望。還有戲院方面。戲院主人本來要擔保的。維克多給了他一張期票。所以維克多的戲，要是失敗了，他没有法子兌付那個期票，他祇好去坐監牢了。因此他的現狀，眞是危險萬分。先莉聽完了，冷冷地說道··［那亦不關我什麽事。我眞是不願意再聽見關於維克多的事情了。］等到客人走了，先莉一個人在屋子裏跑來跑去，心中眞是替維克多焦急萬分。於是她又悟到她仍舊是愛他的······比從前還要愛得厲害些。</p>
<p>幕快啓了。TheCatandtheFiddle快上臺了。戲幕後面一大堆的演員擁在一起。維克多亦擠在他們一起。新尋到的女主角眼涙汪汪的瞪着他。她說··［從前我還能够隨心所欲地表演。現在我已經老了。你想一個做了祖母的人，還能够上臺扮做小姑娘表演嗎？］維克多拍着她的肩膀，安慰着她道··［我愛，不要緊的，你一定表演得很好，不要悉。］他嘴裏雖這麽說，心裏早已寒了半截。他想起了明天巴黎全城對他的嘲笑······大家都提着他的名字，他的小歌劇，以及他可笑的女主角······明天······他彎着嘴冷笑着······明天不是他因爲無法對付那張支票，已經關在監牢裏了嗎。但是時間不容許他獨自深思，他的節目已經到了，他亦要去上臺，他亦要好好兒表演的······（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Fujian Fellow Provincials Association in Beijing sent a telegram to Chen Yi, stating that the rebels have been defeated, Fujian's territory has been secured, and the central government has specially appointed you to come and pacify this region. All Fujianese are deeply delighted. However, our Fujian Province has suffered from soldiers and bandits for many years, and the suffering has been profound. Moreover, due to this major upheaval, the displacement and misery are beyond words. Currently, the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou areas are still occupied by bandits, and the remnants of the rebels are still attempting to seize control. Scars are everywhere, and there is an urgent need for relief. There are countless matters to be handled after the war, and there is no time to waste. You have a strong reputation and your governance in Zhejiang is still in the hearts of the people. Fujian is a neighboring province, and we have also heard of your virtuous reputation. This time, with your leadership, we are confident that you will be able to pacify the local area and comfort the people, so that all the people of the province can live in peace. We send this telegram to welcome you. The Fujian Fellow Provincials Association in Beijing bows. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) According to Hua Fang's news from Fuzhou, Chen Youren disguised himself as a foreign sailor and hid on a foreign warship to escape from Fuzhou. It is rumored that Chen Mingshu has secretly arrived in Hong Kong. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sun and Ma's Troops</p>
<p>Are Confronting Each Other at Shizuizi</p>
<p>No Intense Fighting Reported at the Front</p>
<p>Ningxia Army Deploys Defenses to Prevent Sun's Army from Entering the Woye Area</p>
<p>(Beijing) Sun and Ma's troops are still confronting each other in the Shizuizi area. There have been no war reports reaching Beijing from the front since 12:00 PM on the 15th. According to observations, there has only been contact between the two sides, and no intense fighting seems to have occurred. A report was presented at today's routine meeting of the Military Council, and it was decided to await a clear investigation of the conflict between Sun and Ma's armies and then wait for instructions from the central government for handling. He's envoy Hou Cheng, who went to meet with Yan Xishan, arrived in Shijiazhuang last night and transferred to Taiyuan this morning. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Ningxia authorities stated that when Sun's troops departed from Wuyuan, they originally divided into three routes to advance southwest: one route followed the Ningxia-Suiyuan Highway, passing through Dengkou, Shizuizi, and Pingluo to cross the river to Woye; another route crossed the Yellow River from Wuyuan and went directly to Woye along the east bank of the river. Currently, the defenses at Shizuizi are solid, and it is difficult for Sun's troops to pass through. To prevent Sun's cavalry on the east bank of the river from reaching Woye, another force has been dispatched from Ningxia to cross the river and deploy defenses along the northern part of Woye on the east bank of the Yellow River, establishing contact with the defense line west of the Yellow River at Shizuizi. If Sun's troops continue to advance, it is expected that intense fighting will occur in that area within one or two days. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Sun Dianying telegraphed Beijing, stating that his army's troops heading to Woye were intercepted by the Ningxia army, and the situation is urgent. Moreover, in this desolate area of hundreds of miles with no inhabitants, whether from a geographical or military perspective, it is not easy to stop abruptly. It is hoped that a stable solution can be found based on the actual situation at the front. He's telegram to stop was only received this afternoon and has been complied with. However, the Ningxia side is still pressing forward step by step, which is truly worrying. Wang Shiping telegraphed Beijing, reporting that Sun's army has always supported the central government. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Ma Hongkui's representative visited Yan this morning and reported everything. According to talks, Sun had organized Yang Hou, Xiao Wangying, and other troops into a division to serve as the vanguard, clashing with the Ningxia army at Dengkou. Currently, Chairman Ma and Director Zhu have mobilized a large army to block and defend, determined not to let them lightly cross the boundary. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) He Yingqin's representative, Hou Cheng, arrived in Taiyuan this afternoon and stayed at the Shanxi Hotel. He presented a personal letter and visited Yan that evening. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official from the Executive Yuan stated that regarding the conflict between Sun and Ma, the Executive Yuan had telegraphed the Political Readjustment Council stationed in Beijing to investigate the truth and work with the Beijing Military Council to find ways to stop it. Now, another telegram has been sent ordering Sun's troops to stop their westward advance and instructing both sides to cease military actions and await instructions. As for the handling methods, they are currently being discussed with Chairman Chiang and Chairman He of the Military Council. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the conflict between Sun and Ma, Sun's army is still stationed at Shizuizi and Dengkou, more than 300 miles from the capital of Ningxia Province. Chairman Chiang, President Wang, and Acting Chairman He are currently discussing solutions. According to repeated telegrams from Sun, his army has always obeyed the central government, and this time the opening of Woye is for the purpose of reclamation and has no other ambitions. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Internal wars are frequent. Sun Dianying and Ma Hongkui are fighting each other on the border of Ningxia. Sun's representative, Lu Hongkui, said that Sun was ordered to open up wasteland for land reclamation last June but was repeatedly misunderstood by Ningxia and Qinghai, resulting in a situation where he could not proceed. Now, his subordinates are left in Wuyuan and hiding in the area between the Yellow River, suffering from hunger and cold, and have no food or supplies. He had no choice but to reiterate his plight and request instructions from his superiors. He was pleased to be able to reclaim Woye to avoid falling into ditches. This time, he repeatedly negotiated with Ningxia's Ma to pass through Ningxia, but it was ultimately ineffective. However, Sun's army has no intention of occupying the area for long. Recently, Sun's army commander again showed sincerity to Ma, wanting to have his wife brought to the provincial capital as a hostage to seek understanding, but it ultimately did not work out, and the conflict was thus initiated. However, Sun's army commander very much wants to avoid war and plans to no longer advance, quietly waiting for the central government to resolve the matter. I am running around in Beijing to mediate and separately requesting instructions from the central government and the Military Council. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liang Jing, the Director of the Ningxia Finance Department, visited President Wang on the 17th to discuss post-war arrangements. According to talks, Sun and Ma Hongkui are as close as brothers, and the misunderstanding is truly unfortunate. Ma is stationed with a duty and has not received orders from the central government to allow Sun to pass through. Moreover, Zhu Shaoliang ordered that Sun be prohibited from establishing military stations in Ningxia, so troops were sent to guard strictly. If the central government approves Sun's troops to open up the west, we will wholeheartedly welcome them. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu Guitang's Troops</p>
<h3>Flee Westward Out of Linluo Pass</h3>
<p>Another Group Flees into Linqing County</p>
<p>He Zhuguo Goes to Daming to Supervise the Suppression</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Guitang's troops were attacked from both the front and rear by the Hebei and Shandong armies, and several groups fled westward, passing through Quzhou and Yongnian, crossing the Pinghan Railway at Linluo Pass on the 17th, intending to enter Wu'an County in northern Henan. Another group of 400-500 people fled into Linqing County in northern Shandong. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han stated that Liu Guitang is now near Handan, and the troops of this province are conducting guerrilla warfare within 100 li outside the province. Liu's troops fear aerial reconnaissance and dare not come to Shandong. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Shijiazhuang telegram states that He Zhuguo went to Daming on the 16th to supervise the suppression of Liu's bandits. Liu's bandits have now fled from Shandong into the areas of Quzhou, Shenze, and Qingfeng in southern Hebei, attempting to flee back into Henan Province. He's troops, led by Chang's division, are currently engaged in suppression, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Military Council ordered He Zhuguo to be responsible for supervising the suppression of Liu Guitang. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kailuan Strike Resolved</p>
<p>Mining Bureau Agrees to Workers' Demands</p>
<p>All Mines Scheduled to Resume Work Today</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kailuan Mining Bureau has agreed to the demands of the Majiagou mine workers and scheduled to resume work on the 18th. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The labor unrest at the Kailuan coal mines is gradually escalating due to the extreme positions taken by both labor and management. Workers' representatives went to the provincial party headquarters again on the 17th to petition. The party headquarters has dispatched personnel to Majiagou to investigate the truth. The workers are currently making three demands: (1) Please remove and punish Shang Wenbin, the culprit who ordered the police to shoot the workers, and the local Public Security Bureau chief; (2) Please have the central government deal with the Kailuan coal mine authorities in accordance with the law for violating the agreement; and (3) Abolish the subcontracting system, restore the labor union, and guarantee all workers' rights and interests. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kailuan Majiagou mine workers went on strike on the 14th due to the failure to obtain year-end bonuses. The mine authorities ignored them. They went on strike on the 15th. The mine authorities still ignored them. On the 16th, they sent workers to the four mines, including Pingxiang, Gezhuang, and Linxi, to ask for assistance but were stopped by the mine police, resulting in a conflict. Both sides opened fire. Two mine police officers were injured, four workers were injured, and two workers were killed. The strike continued on the 17th, and the situation is serious. The provincial government has ordered the Tangshan Public Security Bureau to properly mediate. The mine authorities stated that workers' bonuses would be paid as usual. If the workers have no other hidden agenda, the matter can be concluded. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kailuan Majiagou coal mine is the largest of the five mines, with over 10,000 workers. After the war, the labor union stopped its activities, and the capital arbitrarily dismissed about 600-700 workers. On the 14th, the mine workers demanded the restoration of jobs for the unemployed workers. As there was no result, they announced a strike. At that time, the mine district security team arrived to mediate, causing a conflict. A total of eight police and workers were injured, three seriously, with life-threatening injuries. The Department of Industry has wired Li Yinmin, the supervisor of the Majiagou mine, to handle the matter properly. The workers are only demanding the restoration of their jobs as a condition. The order is still good, and they have obeyed Li's advice and scheduled to resume work on the 17th. As for the injured personnel, the authorities plan to order the factory to provide compensation to avoid escalating the situation. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The American Recovery Problem and Roosevelt's Monetary Policy By Ying</h3>
<p>It has been more than half a year since the United States implemented the National Industrial Recovery Act. However, the ultimate goal of so-called restoring prosperity has yet to be realized. Low prices, overproduction, reduced trade, and increased unemployment—everything everywhere in the United States is plagued by the problem of economic depression, which remains very serious. Therefore, many people fundamentally doubt whether the strategies adopted by the Washington government can restore the past prosperity of capitalism. However, according to overseas news reports yesterday, the United States is now implementing a new policy. Compared with the previous strategies, such as suspending the gold standard and buying gold at home and abroad, it seems to have taken a further step. But from our observations, this new policy is still trapped in the snare of trying to raise prices through monetary policy.</p>
<p>The content of the new American policy has two important points: (1) All gold owned by the Federal Reserve Banks must be transferred to the U.S. Treasury Department, and the Treasury Department will provide the Reserve Banks with U.S. dollars of equal value as credit. (2) All cash must not circulate. Gold coins must be abolished and not redeemed. Private cash holdings must be turned over to the Treasury Department for purchase. In addition, there are three newly promulgated laws. The main significance lies in managing foreign exchange and prohibiting capital flight, which is also an inevitable step after prohibiting cash circulation within the country. The main points of the so-called new policy are as described above.</p>
<p>We must first understand what impact Roosevelt's new monetary policy has on the country. The basic purpose of the new monetary policy is to raise prices, especially to raise domestic prices in the United States. If prices can be raised to the level of 1926, then debts incurred at the same time in that year can be easily repaid from the debtor's point of view. Therefore, the U.S. authorities believe that if the cash value of the U.S. dollar can be reduced by 40%, the U.S. dollar value of commodities should also be raised by 40% accordingly. From this point of view, the value of commodities seems to be manipulated by the amount of gold content in the U.S. dollar. However, it is not known that the determining factor of commodity value lies in the actual purchasing power of society. Value can only increase when purchasing power is developed; otherwise, commodities will only be stockpiled forever, and how can value be raised? Leaving aside other considerations, just look at the American farmers, who are suffering because they have mountains of agricultural products rather than gold. The U.S. dollar value of gold can increase from $20.67 to $35, but the U.S. dollar value of agricultural products does not necessarily increase by the same amount, unless artificial methods are used to burn the agricultural products until the price is raised. From this point of view, the purpose of the new monetary policy, the so-called raising of prices, may not be possible to achieve.</p>
<p>The new American monetary policy may not have much impact on domestic prices, but it can be a way for the U.S. government to generate wealth and increase revenue more quickly and easily than any other method, such as raising taxes or borrowing money. According to U.S. President Roosevelt, the government will profit approximately 420 million yuan from the reduction in the pure gold content of the U.S. dollar, which is more than the entire year's revenue. This is the result of the transfer of gold management rights. However, what we must not forget is that the U.S. government has simultaneously suspended its obligation to pay government debts in pure gold. Therefore, in terms of impact, the only effect of Roosevelt's new policy still lies in this rather than elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Central Political Council Passed</p>
<h3>Regulations for Mongolian Autonomy</h3>
<p>Li Wenfan Appointed as National Government Committee Member</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council convened its 392nd meeting on the morning of the 17th. Attendees included Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Gu Mengyu, Kong Xiangxi, Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, Shi Qingyang, Shi Ying, and over thirty others. Wang Zhaoming chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(A) The Regulations for Mongolian Autonomy are as follows: (1) Regarding the extent of autonomy in Inner Mongolia, the Category A measures proposed by the Mongolian representatives, which involve establishing autonomous regional governments in different districts, are deemed to be in line with the principles set by the Central Government and can be adopted. Separate measures will be drafted later regarding their regional affiliation, organizational authority, funding, and other aspects, and laws will be enacted and implemented. (2) Regarding the implementation procedures for Mongolian autonomy, it seems necessary to establish a preparatory office before the formal establishment of autonomous regional governments. However, the Central Government must send personnel to provide effective guidance, or the Central Government should appoint the chairman of the local provincial government as a special commissioner for guidance. The procedures for selecting personnel will be determined separately. (3) Regarding the scope of the Mongolian autonomous region, the establishment of the Mongolian autonomous region should be limited to areas without established county administrations. Two districts each will be established within the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan. Their names will be the First Autonomous Region Government of the Republic of China (Mongolia), the Second Autonomous Region Government, and so on. However, if the two autonomous regions established within Chahar Province or Suiyuan Province are originally merged into one self-governing region, the respective provinces may report to the Ministry of Interior of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. Areas within the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan where county administrations have already been established, and which fall entirely under provincial administrative jurisdiction, or areas where regional complexities necessitate detailed demarcation, will be surveyed and demarcated by the provincial government in conjunction with the district government, and the results will be reported to the Ministry of Interior of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Alxa Ejin Banner region, originally under the jurisdiction of Ningxia Province, will not be included in the autonomous region. (4) Regarding the organization of the autonomous regional government: 1. The autonomous regional government will have five to fifteen members, with one serving as chairman and two as vice-chairmen, all of whom should be appointed by the Central Government and should be local residents in principle. 2. The district government will handle affairs through departments. 3. In order to discuss common matters among the autonomous regions, the Central Government will dispatch personnel to convene a joint meeting of the autonomous regions once a year. 4. The autonomous region will have a two-tiered district and banner system. Each district and banner will establish a people's self-governance organization, the details of which will be determined by law. 5. The location of the district government will be approved by the Central Government. (5) Regarding the subordination of the autonomous regional government, the Mongolian autonomous regional governments will be subordinate to the Executive Yuan and subject to the direction and supervision of the central departments in charge. (6) Regarding the authority of the autonomous regional government, the authority over national defense and military command within the Mongolian autonomous region, as well as matters related to foreign affairs, will be handled by the Central Government in a unified manner or delegated to the local provincial government for execution. Other matters deemed to have special characteristics by the Central Government may also be delegated to the local provincial government for handling. Mongolian and banner administration matters not delegated by the Central Government to the provincial government for handling will be handled by the district government in a unified manner. The district government may issue district orders and formulate specific rules within the scope of not conflicting with the laws and regulations of the Central Government and the local provincial government. However, measures that restrict the freedom of the people or increase the people's burden may not be implemented without the approval of the National Government. (7) Regarding the relationship between the provincial government and the autonomous regional government, various Mongolian and banner administration matters within the Mongolian autonomous region authorized by the Central Government to the provincial government will still be handled by the provincial government in a unified manner. Matters not authorized by the Central Government to the provincial government will be handled by the district government in accordance with the Central Government's directives. In cases involving the scope of provincial administration, consultations with the provincial government are still required. All Mongolian and banner administration matters and disputes between Mongolians and Han Chinese in areas where county administrations have already been established will still be handled by the local provincial government. When necessary, a special committee may be established to resolve disputes between the province and the district. The Central Government may entrust the provincial government to represent the Central Government in guiding the Mongolian district government in handling local autonomy. (8) Regarding the administrative expenses of the autonomous regional government, the administrative expenses of the autonomous regional government should be budgeted and approved by the Central Government for allocation and subsidy. All tax revenues should be divided into national taxes and local taxes in accordance with the standards set by the Central Government. All national taxes will be collected directly by the Central Government or delegated to the local provincial government for collection. All local taxes will be collected by the provincial government in areas where county administrations have already been established, and by the autonomous regional government in areas where county administrations have not yet been established. (9) Regarding the financial issues of the autonomous region, in areas that have been developed and where county administrations have already been established, all existing land rights of Mongolians and Han Chinese will remain unchanged. In Mongolian and banner areas that have not been developed and where county administrations have not been established, animal husbandry will be the main occupation, supplemented by agriculture. Citizens of the Republic of China, regardless of ethnicity, who have continuously resided in the region for more than one year, will have the right to engage in nomadic grazing and cultivation. If the district government deems it necessary to develop land within the autonomous region, it may report to the Central Government for approval at any time to open it freely for cultivation by Mongolians and Han Chinese. Livestock in undeveloped areas should be improved through various means, and the Central Government should establish cattle and sheep epidemic prevention stations and serum manufacturing branches in suitable locations to benefit animal husbandry and promote hygiene. Forests and minerals should be nationalized and developed by the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance should establish branches of the Central Bank in the various autonomous regions to serve as active financial institutions. (10) Regarding the education issues of the autonomous region, the issue of reforming the Mongolian education system and subsidizing Mongolian education expenses should be referred to the Ministry of Education in conjunction with the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for overall planning and formulation of specific measures. (11) Regarding the judicial issues of the autonomous region, the matter should be referred to the Ministry of Justice in conjunction with the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for formulation of specific measures.</p>
<p>B. The ordinance for the issuance of the Hubei Province Financial Consolidation Public Bonds of the Republic of China for 1934, totaling 4 million yuan, was approved in principle and sent to the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>C. The Central Executive Committee was requested to elect Li Wenfan as a member of the National Government Committee.</p>
<p>D. The allocation of 60,000 yuan in annual recurring expenses to subsidize schools in the late Premier's hometown was approved. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Taibao and fourteen other representatives of the Khalkha League and Banner of Inner Mongolia, regarding the Central Political Council's changes to the Mongolian autonomy regulations, went to the Central Political Council on the morning of the 17th to petition for the maintenance of the original plan and personally delivered a petition. The Political Council dispatched Secretary-General Tang Youren to receive them, who promised to convey the petition to the Central Political Council for adoption. The original petition stated: The eleven articles of the Mongolian autonomy regulations, negotiated by Minister Huang in Bailingmiao with the league and banner leaders and representatives, were repeatedly promised by Wang and Dai to be unchanged, which was deeply gratifying. However, it is now heard that as a result of repeated reviews by the council, due to the advocacy of one or two members, the original plan of two districts has been changed to four districts, with one league as one district, and areas where counties have been established and the three special banners of Alxa and Ejin have been excluded. Almost all of the original plan's spirit has been completely erased. The reason given is that the Suiyuan Provincial Government reported to the Central Government that the league leaders and deputy league leaders of the Ih Ju League had expressed their willingness to have one league as one autonomous region. This matter was entirely fabricated by the Suiyuan Provincial Government. In addition to a separate statement of the truth by the representatives of the Ih Ju League, it is noted that the original purpose of the leagues' request for autonomy was to unite against aggression. If the original one league is still used as one district, then what is the point of this extra effort? As for areas where counties have been established and the three banners of Alxa and Ejin, they are all part of the Mongolian territory. If they are not allowed to be included in the autonomous region, how will they be treated? Moreover, the original plan for Mongolian autonomy was negotiated by Minister Huang, who closely understood the actual situation of Mongolia, on behalf of the Central Government. If it is changed abruptly based on the advocacy of one or two individuals, it will not only damage the Central Government's prestige but also seem to be making fun of Mongolia. Now, Eastern Mongolia has fallen to Japanese traitors, and no measures for relief from the Central Government have been heard. For Western Mongolia, which has no guarantee for the morning, it is not willing to give them the opportunity to save themselves and the country. The Suiyuan Provincial Government has repeatedly sent personnel to various leagues to use coercion and bribery to make them express opposition to Mongolian autonomy, causing League Leader Yun of the Ulanqab League to resign against his will, and the Shiliingol League did not send representatives to Beijing. How could Inner Mongolia, which has supported the Central Government for more than a decade as one day, have reached this point? Now, the rumor that the puppet organization has been changed to the Manchu-Mongol Empire and that Puyi will restore the throne and move the capital to Chengde is becoming more and more real. If this rumor comes true, then not only will a major change occur between Mongolia and the Central Government, but Mongolia itself will be doomed. At that time, what methods will the Central Government have to deal with the aftermath, apart from empty words of long-term resistance? What methods will the Suiyuan Provincial Government have to salvage the situation, apart from perishing together? We, the Mongolians who will inevitably perish without developing resistance, cannot but hold endless regret for the Central Government and the Suiyuan Provincial Government. Esteemed members of the council, with your profound and far-reaching plans for the country, you must be aware of the aforementioned difficult situation. We earnestly request that you maintain the original plan of the eleven articles of the Mongolian autonomy regulations negotiated by Minister Huang so that Mongolian autonomy can be realized as soon as possible. We will be grateful for your great virtue beyond measure. If you do not heed our plea and still pass the reviewed plan, then our leagues and banners will absolutely not dare to accept it. The representatives can only return to Mongolia in tears and await our fate. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Panchen Arrives in Guihua</h3>
<p>Guihua The Panchen Lama, with his entourage of over sixty people in fifteen cars, departed from Bailingmiao at 6 a.m. on the 16th, rested briefly at Zhaohuo, and arrived in Suiyuan in the evening. Fu Zuoyi, Leng Rong, Pan Wang, and others greeted him outside the Beishaliang Pass. Lama musicians, military bands, and military police were all lined up to welcome him. Crowds lined the streets, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere. Soldiers from Fu's troops were stationed along the route to maintain order. The residence was set up at the Suiyuan Hotel. It was reported that a banquet was held in the evening to welcome the Panchen Lama, with Leng Rong and dignitaries from all walks of life invited to accompany him. The Panchen Lama, suffering from a cough and toothache, sent his Secretary-General Liu Jiaju to meet with reporters. Liu said that the Panchen Lama was summoned to Beijing by Premier Wang and others to attend the Fourth Plenary Session and discuss border affairs. He originally planned to go to Ih Ju League to chant scriptures before going to Beijing, but upon hearing the news of the Dalai Lama's death, he canceled his trip to Ih Ju League and sent Ma Shu Kanbu with eleven lamas to represent him at Ih Ju League to chant scriptures. The Panchen Lama was extremely saddened by the Dalai Lama's death and had been unable to eat or sleep for several days. In addition to issuing a notice to lamas in monasteries throughout Mongolia, Qinghai, and Tibet to chant scriptures in remembrance and expressing condolences at all offices, he also recited sutras himself to help the Dalai Lama transcend. Regarding the political and religious affairs of Tibet after the Dalai Lama's death, the Panchen Lama earnestly hopes that the Central Government will first send personnel to Tibet to inspect the situation. The Panchen Lama will return to Ih Ju League and then Qinghai after consulting with Premier Wang and others in Beijing to prepare for his return to Tibet. The Panchen Lama plans to stay in Suiyuan for one day and leave Suiyuan on the 18th, stopping briefly at Ping to proceed to Beijing to attend the Plenary Session. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Panchen Lama is scheduled to depart from Suiyuan for Ping on the 18th. Mongolian paper money is worth only a few cents per yuan. Grain prices in the Northwest are low, harming farmers, and rural areas are bankrupt. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Dalai Lama's British Advisor</p>
<h3>Recently Returned to Lhasa</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Dalai Lama's death, political and religious power in Lhasa remains in the hands of the pro-British faction. Most military generals are students who studied in England. However, there are many senior officials in Tibet who support the Central Government and possess considerable potential influence. The two factions have been evenly matched. Recently, Britain dispatched Bailey, the former military advisor to the Dalai Lama, back to Lhasa. What his intention is, is worth noting. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Opening Day of the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<h3>Preparatory Meeting to be Held Immediately</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the opening ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session on the morning of the 20th, a preparatory meeting will be held at 2 p.m. to decide on: 1. The duration of the General Assembly; 2. The election of the Presidium of the General Assembly; 3. The election of the Proposal Review Committee of each group; 4. The election of the Secretary-General of the General Assembly. It is estimated that the number of committee members attending will be sufficient for a quorum. Ye Chucang will serve as the Secretary-General of the General Assembly. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>

A land reclamation plan, requesting the government to allocate funds for refugees from the Northeast who have entered the customs to develop the Northwest; 2. A proposal to strengthen rural administrative agencies; 3. A proposal to establish national policies. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Regular Meeting of the Peiping Military Council</h3>
<p>(Beiping) At this morning's regular meeting of the Military Council, He Yingqin reported on the conflict between Sun Dianying and Ma Hongkui's troops.

He Yingqin chaired the meeting and first reported on the conflict between Sun Dianying and Ma Hongkui on the Suiyuan-Ningxia border. Next, Qin Dechun reported on the Japanese and puppet troops' attack on Longmensuo. Two resolutions were then passed: (1) The Provisional 1st Cavalry Division under Tan Zixin will be allocated a monthly subsidy of 10,000 yuan from the Military Council's office expenses, starting from January of this year. (2) Shao Wenkai, Huang Xiansheng, and Qiao Fang were all promoted to lieutenant general. The meeting adjourned at approximately 11 a.m. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Italian Prime Minister Issues Second Article</p>
<h3>Rejecting the Yellow Peril</h3>
<p>Japanese Policy Harms World Peace</p>
<p>Urges European National Unity to Resist</p>
<p>Rome The [Italian People's Daily] published an article by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on the Far East issue. Italian newspapers have long been aware of this article, which was written for an American news agency. Mussolini personally expressed his rejection of the "Yellow Peril" stance, marking the second time he has done so. On November 14th of last year, when the Asian Student Congress was held in Rome, Mussolini already delivered a speech, stating the harm of Japanese policy. The current article will make this issue all the more prominent. Italians believe the effect of this article is to promote friendship between Italy and the United States and Italy and Russia. Mussolini stated in the article that the opposition between China and Japan will not last forever, thus proving that a new Europe must unite before it can be. Italy is the mediator to harmonize Europe and Asia. We still remember that when Japan announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations, Italian public opinion believed that Europe should unite to deal with it. Mussolini's recently published article has the same meaning. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Constructs</p>
<h3>Giant Aircraft</h3>
<p>Carrying a Load of Six or Seven Tons, Accommodating Over Sixty People</p>
<p>Complete Communication Equipment</p>
<p>Specifically for Propaganda Purposes</p>
<p>(London) Details regarding the giant aircraft currently being manufactured by Soviet Russia were disclosed today by the information office of the Soviet Embassy to reporters from the Standard Evening News. According to reports, this giant aircraft will be used specifically for propaganda purposes after its construction. The aircraft will be equipped with a printing press, a telephone, a movie projector, wireless radio, and wireless movies, among other things. In addition to the flight crew, the aircraft will also carry many typists, telephone operators, and movie drivers. The total load will be approximately six or seven tons. Whenever the aircraft arrives at a city, it will fly at a very low altitude, and at the same time, use a large sound amplifier to broadcast pre-arranged programs to the entire city. Leaflets and pamphlets pre-printed in the aircraft can also be distributed at the same time. The aircraft can also emit smoke in the sky to form letters, which can be seen from two miles away. The entire crew of the aircraft will be approximately sixty-five people. However, British experts are skeptical of this claim but are willing to observe its progress. (National Electric, 16th)</p>

<p>League of Nations Discusses Saar Issue</p>
<h3>Germany Refuses to Send Representatives to Attend</h3>

<p>Saar Issue Has Become a Fierce Dispute</p>

<p>Simon and Pongou Head to Geneva</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the German government sent a letter to the League of Nations Secretariat, declaring that Germany is unwilling to attend the recent group meetings discussing the Saar region issue. The German government received a note from the League of Nations yesterday, stating that the Administrative Committee had placed the Saar issue on the last section of the League of Nations agenda. Therefore, although Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it can still attend. However, the German government stated to the League of Nations Secretariat that Germany's absence will allow the Administrative Council to have ample opportunity to deliberate at length.

<p>League of Nations Administrative Council</p>
<h3>Closed Door Meeting</h3>
<p>Reappoints Saar Governing Commission</p>
<p>Term Extended to April Next Year</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting today to handle administrative matters, such as reappointing the Saar Basin Management Commission. It will then hold a public meeting to pass the report of the Mandates Commission and other unimportant issues. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Ignoring that the Saar issue has become a fierce dispute, the League of Nations Administrative Council today approved the appointment of Mr. Knox as Chairman of the Saar Regional Management Commission, as well as the appointment of other members, with a term until April 1935. This resolution is seen as the League of Nations' decision to exert its power in the Saar dispute and resist the Nazi Party's attacks on the commission. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Saar Issue</p>
<h3>Situation Extremely Serious</h3>
<p>Governing Commission Submits Report</p>
<p>Stating the Nazi Party's Atrocities</p>
<p>Saar Occupied by International Troops</p>
<p>League of Nations to Discuss Issue at End of Week</p>
<p>(Geneva) The situation regarding the Saar issue is now more serious than expected. The Chairman of the Saar Management Commission appointed by the League of Nations will submit new information to the League of Nations Administrative Council regarding the atrocities of the Hitler Party in the region. There is currently a strong rumor that the League of Nations Administrative Council will discuss the occupation of the Saar by international troops at the end of this week. As for whether the Saar plebiscite in 1935 will be postponed, the Administrative Council will make a decision. If it decides to postpone the plebiscite, Germany will definitely take special actions because Hitler wants to rescue the territory without waiting for the self-determination vote, that is, to assign the territory to Germany. The Saar Management Commission recently reported on the rampant activities of the National Socialist Party in the region. It is claimed that Hitler's party members have bullied officials and forced residents to donate to the National Socialist Party in the name of charity. From documents seized from Berlin, it is clear that the Saar National Socialist Party has been secretly ordered to recruit brave, capable, and militarily experienced loyal followers. Because once the self-determination vote is held, the outcome will be irreversible, many people advocate postponement to wait for the situation in Germany to change and allow the Saar people to become true Germans.

<p>Pongou Attends Senate</p>
<h3>Explains Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Ensuring Austrian Independence and Maintaining European Balance</p>
<p>Does Not Want to Encircle Germany, Seeks Cooperation</p>
<p>(Paris) The Senate discussed foreign policy questions. Foreign Minister Pongou stood up to answer and explained the various current foreign issues. First, he said that although France does not make a fuss about international issues, it has already expressed its opinions when necessary. There is no reason to be impatient or anxious about the current situation.</p>
<h3>Saar Plebiscite</h3>
<p>As for the Saar issue, France has already expressed its views. Only the local people have the right to decide whether to hold a plebiscite, which France cannot abandon. What France can do is, as a member of the League of Nations, participate in the matter in Geneva. The only thing France cares about is ensuring that the people there can freely express their opinions and not be treated unfairly because of their expressions in the future.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Austrian Independence</h3>
<p>As for Austria, which is being oppressed by the Hitler Party, and atrocities occur from time to time, Austrian independence is actually the key to the European balance of power and must be maintained. France and Italy share the same opinion on this matter. Although the above-mentioned matters concern major principles, they are ultimately passive policies.</p>
<h3>No Intention of Encirclement Germany</h3>
<p>Apart from this, France must continue to strive for construction in diplomacy without any interruption. When the political evolution of the new Germany causes anxiety, France wants to unite all countries that feel the same anxiety so that all countries determined to maintain peace can unite and strengthen their forces based on international cooperation. There is no intention of encircling Germany. If Germany wants to join these countries, the right is in Germany's own hands. Germany previously suggested signing a non-aggression treaty, which France has already accepted. What its true intentions are can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Old Friendship with Satellites</h3>
<p>Pongou continued that France still maintains old friendship with its allied countries and does not relax in the slightest. It has become closer to Italy due to the signing of the Four-Power Pact, but France does not alienate its allied countries because of this. This can be seen from various published documents and exchanges of notes. The understanding between France and its allied countries is more vibrant and active than before. France sees this understanding not as one group opposing other groups, but as part of an overall plan to build peace within the scope of the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>European Security Net</h3>
<p>France intends to expand the scope of this consultation and turn it into a European security net. Although this security net is not yet fully organized, it has made great progress in recent months. France maintains the original treaties between itself and Poland and the countries of the Little Entente. At the same time, it provides diplomatic assistance to these countries to improve their relations with Italy, Soviet Russia, the Balkan countries, and Turkey.</p>
<h3>Improved Franco-Italian Relations</h3>
<p>Pongou continued that the relations between France and Italy have completely changed, and it is a definite fact that the relations between the countries of the Little Entente and Italy are improving. The transformation of the countries of Central Europe requires the participation of Italy and the countries of the Little Entente. If relations improve with each other, then this participation is possible.</p>
<h3>Successful Soviet Policy</h3>
<p>France implements a Soviet policy in the eastern border of Europe. Although Soviet Russia is engaged in revolutionary construction internally, it is actually a conservative force for the current order in Europe in terms of international relations. Because France cannot have a comprehensive security plan internationally at present, it is gradually signing various partial treaties for relief. This kind of partial treaty increases day by day, and it will be able to accumulate into a fur coat from many small pieces and become a peaceful construction.</p>
<h3>Striving for Peace Building</h3>
<p>Although the entire plan for peaceful construction is difficult to establish suddenly, it has been partially realized. Soviet Russia has signed non-aggression treaties with many countries, and its actions are the same as France's. Although Soviet Russia is not within the League of Nations, it provides assistance to the member states, and the member states also assist it. The form of the treaties signed by Soviet Russia with various countries is not as precise as the Locarno Treaty, but its function is also equal. Although the Locarno Treaty has been criticized by all parties, the promises it contains do have the value of the old alliance treaties. Since the treaties signed by Soviet Russia with various countries have the same function as the Locarno Treaty, then their value is worthy of our praise.</p>
<h3>On the Balkan Question</h3>
<p>Peng Gu Xuan discussed the Balkan question, saying that Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, and Turkey would soon sign a non-aggression treaty to guarantee the territorial integrity of each signatory, and he hoped that Bulgaria could also participate. Italy has no objection to this matter.</p>
<h3>Consistently Supporting the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Finally, Peng Gu said that France will always express complete trust in the League of Nations, and its attitude need not be repeated.</p>
<h3>Parliamentarians Speak One After Another, All Distrusting Germany</h3>
<p>After Peng Gu finished speaking, parliamentarian Goterot spoke, vigorously explaining the insecurity of Franco-German compromise, and also specifically raised reservations about Franco-Russian consultation, saying that in the event of war, one cannot rely on Russian military assistance, and demanded guarantees for the implementation of the Franco-Russian agreement. Subsequently, former President Miller Hangwei delivered a speech, urging the French people to unite sincerely and expressing distrust of Germany's peace proposals. After Mr. Miller finished speaking, former Ambassador to Rome, Ju Fenal, delivered a speech, saying that France should not always listen to others in international negotiations, especially in Franco-German negotiations. Ju Fenal believed that there was an opportunity to maintain peace in Franco-German negotiations, and also said that France's alliances with various countries must be placed in the entire construction of Europe to be effective. Finally, he spoke broadly about the impropriety of infringing on the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries, believing that there is already a possibility of separate unity among nations, but the scope of unity must not be too broad, and its largest scope belongs to the League of Nations, etc. At this point, the meeting was adjourned and scheduled to reconvene on Thursday.

<h3>Unexpected Visit to Vienna</h3>
<p>Discussing the Increase of Trade Relations</p>
<p>A Symbol of Italy's Friendship with Austria</p>
<p>Rome - Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Su Weizhi, departed for Vienna today. Because Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss previously visited Italy, Mr. Su is now visiting Austria in return. This is a manifestation of Italy's friendship with Austria and also a symbol of Austria's determination for independence. Italy is quite apprehensive about the activities of the National Socialist Party in Austria, so it is strongly assisting the Austrian Chancellor to eliminate them. When the Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs visits Austria, he may discuss ways to increase Austrian trade in Trieste and Fiume. Austria should enjoy the convenience of a free port in Fiume according to the treaty. (Reuters News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>American Capture of Japanese Spy</h3>
<p>Taking Photos of Fortress Locations</p>
<p>Kearny City, New Jersey, USA - Five employees of the Japanese National Railways were investigated by the local railway police on suspicion of being spies and were arrested. Later, they were released on bail by the local Japanese Vice-Consul. It is reported that these five Japanese had taken photos of railways and bridges here. In addition, the local naval shipyard is currently building two destroyers, and the Japanese were also taking photos not far from the shipyard. After the five Japanese were arrested, it was found that one of them had previously driven a car in violation of regulations and had given a false name when questioned, which further confirmed the suspicion of espionage. However, the incident should not be regarded as serious. A senior official of the US State Department in Washington stated that the United States has no laws prohibiting nationals from taking photos, but taking photos at fortress locations is not allowed. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(New York) - The Taibailuozi newspaper published today in large characters on the front page the news that five Japanese were arrested in Kearney, New Jersey, for taking photos of bridges. It is now known that the arrested Japanese were released after several hours of interrogation due to the intervention of the Japanese Vice-Consul. The authorities are now investigating whether the Baimei procedures are legal. (Reuters News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Monetary Policy Implementation</p>
<h3>International Markets Face Major Threat</h3>
<p>Britain Begins to Consolidate Its Commercial Position</p>
<p>Currency War Will Lead to Currency Stability</p>
<p>(Washington) - President Roosevelt's monetary plan is not only a major problem for the United States itself, but also involves various countries internationally. Economic experts here predict that after the President's plan is implemented, there will be an immediate international exchange war. The resulting devaluation of the currencies of the United Kingdom and the United States will encourage foreign trade in both countries. The United Kingdom is extremely anxious about the President's proposed exchange stabilization fund of $2,000,000,000, as its impact on the gold pound is very large. London has begun preparations to maintain its international commercial position. It is generally predicted that the result of the currency war between the United Kingdom and the United States will promote international stability. The US President also has this intention. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) - The Cabinet today spent a long time discussing President Roosevelt's monetary plan, as its impact on the British gold pound and international trade markets is extremely significant. The Cabinet meeting was originally to discuss the reports of Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Paris and Italy. During the meeting, discussions also touched on strengthening contact and cooperation with various colonies. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>United States</p>
<h3>Ceasing Purchase of Foreign Cash</h3>
<p>Monetary Bill Expected to Pass Congress</p>
<p>(Washington) - The Treasury Department stated today that the price of gold is still fixed at $34.45. The Financial Relief Agency stopped purchasing overseas cash yesterday afternoon. The new gold price appropriately reduces the value of the US dollar to 60% of its legal value. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau explained to the Senate Banking and Currency Committee today President Roosevelt's plan to take over all currency gold and devalue the US dollar in a flexible manner. Reporters surrounded Morgenthau and asked about issues immediately related to international currency. Mr. Morgenthau replied, "We should do it well," and said that the Financial Relief Agency has stopped purchasing overseas cash because all its gold reserves are now taken over by the Treasury Department. "However, arrangements also need to be made and have not yet been finalized." The Senate Republican Party convened today and decided to demand a full explanation of President Roosevelt's monetary procedures but has not yet decided on a concrete attitude. The majority Democratic Party in Congress now believes that the monetary bill proposed by President Roosevelt will not be difficult to pass. The House Coinage Committee is now preparing to hear opinions on the current state of gold. It is reported that Father Coughlin will also present his views to the committee. Father Coughlin is known as the "Radio Priest" and often makes non-official criticisms of current affairs, so his name is known throughout the country. (Reuters News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) - There are many objections in Congress to the President's message. Silver faction members are very disappointed. Even Congressman Vilor's sixteen-to-one silver proposal is also bleak and unheard of. Senator Skegluen told reporters that the silver issue may not be discussed for the time being, but he firmly believes that newly mined silver will still be priced at 64.5 cents per ounce when sold to the mint and will not be affected by the President's message. Furthermore, the recent silver mining business has developed significantly since the implementation of this fixed price. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Takahashi Talks</p>
<h3>The Issue of Lifting the Gold Ban in Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - When the United States will implement devaluation is another question. The implementation of devaluation in Japan is also only a matter of time. Finance Minister Takahashi also believes that the gold ban should be lifted, the currency should be devalued, and new currency should be issued. His statement today is as follows: "However, looking at the situation in the world financial community, if the gold ban is lifted in the future, starting with the United States, it will certainly be necessary to devalue the currency. The timing of when the gold ban can be lifted is still difficult to predict. The bill on retaining domestic gold production that the government is drafting is also drafted based on this premise. The so-called exchange equalization fund system is a separate issue. Judging from actual examples, its effect is also very small." (Dentsu News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Italian Finance Minister Expresses</p>
<h3>Not Abandoning the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Efforts to Guide National Savings</p>
<p>Rome - The Senate discussed and passed the budget of the Ministry of Finance. During the discussion, Senator Licciardi spoke, questioning the results of the World Economic Conference held in June and July last year. Finance Minister Lank (who served as the chief Italian representative at the World Economic Conference) replied that the results of the World Economic Conference are as follows: (1) The reunion of countries loyal to the gold standard. This aspect has an impact on psychology and is extremely important. (2) Representatives from five countries maintaining the gold standard: France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland, issued a joint declaration on July 3 last year, stating that the governments of those countries regard currency inflation as a great disaster. The representatives of the five countries were unanimous in their attitude. This is the reason for the adjournment of the World Economic Conference. The currencies of the five countries were based on gold in June last year, and they still are today. They will never deviate from the gold standard in the future. Those who advocated for the World Economic Conference to continue at the time predicted that countries using gold would eventually abandon the gold standard. Looking at it now, this alarming prediction was fortunately not accurate. Renke went on to explain that the Italian government will strive to guide national savings and invest them in productive enterprises. Finally, he said that the Italian discount rate has been reduced to 3%, which is an unprecedented event in Italian economic history. It is truly the result of the Pan-System Party's twelve years in power. (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>France Restricts Imports</p>
<h3>Italy Retaliates Against France</h3>
<p>Rome - France implemented import restrictions on January 1, which greatly impacted Italian exporters. Italy then adopted a retaliatory plan today.

Other items such as perfume, soap, women's hats, woolen fabrics, toys, and cotton yarn will be subject to heavy import duties. This order is specifically targeted at France.

<h3>Economic Alliance Established</h3>
<p>Agreement Expected to Be Announced Today</p>
<p>Prague - The Permanent Economic Conference of the Small Entente countries is currently meeting here. An economic agreement has been drafted today, containing fifteen resolutions. The agreement will be the foundation of the economic alliance of the Small Entente countries and is expected to be finalized today and take effect from January 1 this year. It is reported that the agreement stipulates that imported agricultural products will be monopolized. The amount of industrial products exported from Czechoslovakia to Yugoslavia and Romania will be greatly increased in exchange for the same amount of agricultural products. However, Czechoslovakia will not use them itself but will sell them to other countries. The detailed text of the agreement is expected to be announced tomorrow. (National News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>Havana - New President Sevia was sworn in today, but conspiracies and counter-conspiracies are still brewing in the city and elsewhere. The new President is taking on a difficult task at this time, and unless he has extraordinary talent, it will be difficult for him to remain in office. Sevia is a graduate of the US Naval Academy. It is rumored that Colonel Batista, the leader of last year's revolution, is now planning a new coup and intends to implement a military dictatorship, appointing himself as dictator. Both the rise and fall of former President San Martin were orchestrated by Batista. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>

<p>Japanese Military Officer Agrees to Telegraph to Stop the Attack</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram, the provincial government received a report from Chicheng that over a thousand Japanese-puppet troops from the Heihe area occupied Zhaojiaying and Guojiayaozi, and four armored vehicles with more than a dozen machine guns were sent from Xifengkou to pressure our defense area in Longmensuo. Song Brigade, guarding Longmensuo, strictly stopped them. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram, a Japanese bomber flew to Longmensuo and the Great Wall line for reconnaissance at 3 pm on the 16th. Two bombs were dropped at Longmensuo, but we were not damaged. According to investigation, there are six or seven planes in the new airfield built by the Japanese army along the Heihe River. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army warned our garrison in Chahar by distributing leaflets by plane, with the heading "Warning to the Song Army stationed in Longmensuo," which stated that if the Chinese troops stationed in Longmensuo withdrew, the attack would stop; if they did not withdraw, the Japanese army had completed its preparations for motor roads, airfields, and all military preparations and could be mobilized at any time. After Huang Fu sent Liu Shisun to contact the Japanese military officer Genmoto, Genmoto replied: (1) He has telegraphed Nishioichi, ordering the Japanese army to stop the attack; (2) Future issues can be discussed in Beiping.

<p>(Beiping) The commander of the Japanese-puppet troops stationed in Heihe sent a letter to the commander of our garrison in Longmensuo, stating that our side was not allowed to station troops on the Chicheng line. Our side ignored this letter. Unexpectedly, the Japanese-puppet troops have already launched an attack on Longmensuo from Chicheng yesterday. Huang sent someone named Liu to the Japanese Embassy yesterday to negotiate with the military officer Genmoto. It was decided that (1) the Japanese army's 8th Division Commander Nishioichi would be asked to convey the order to the Japanese army at the front to stop the attack; (2) The military sub-committee ordered Zhang Renjie's troops not to attack, pending negotiations. According to a certain source, the ceasefire agreement line originally extended to Yanqing. Chicheng Longmensuo was originally outside the war zone. The Japanese side intends to extend this line, protruding from the scope of the agreement and restricting our army. This is a one-sided statement with no basis. It is heard that the authorities have informed Huang to negotiate with the Japanese. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>

This time, the Japanese side used the absurd statement of extending the Tanggu Truce Agreement line and the Chicheng line, stating that our side is not allowed to station troops. Our side believes that the ceasefire agreement line originally extended to Yanqing, and there is no such thing as an extended line. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lin Yilang, the commander of the Japanese anti-bandit headquarters stationed in Heihe, previously warned our garrison in Longshousuo in writing. The content was absurd and roughly included four points: (1) The troops stationed east of the Great Wall clearly violated the treaty; (2) All Chinese troops stationed in Longzhansuo, Zhaojiazhuang, and other places should be withdrawn immediately; (3) The Chahar army tore down the puppet state's notice, which was a great act of disrespect; (4) Longmensuo is within the scope of the ceasefire agreement, and the Chinese side is not allowed to station troops. When our side received this document, a part of the Japanese-puppet army, about several hundred people, carrying four light machine guns, suddenly invaded Longmensuo yesterday morning. Zhaojiayaozi in the front had a conflict with our garrison. Reports were sent to the Chahar Provincial Government and Pingfang (Beiping) at the same time. Qin Peichun, Director of the Chahar Civil Affairs Department, reported to Huang and He after receiving the report and requested instructions. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xia Ziming, Commander of the Provisional Brigade of Chahar Province, and Tian Gangyi, Councilor of the Chahar Provincial Government, came to Beiping last night and will go to Tianjin tonight to visit Song Zheyuan to report on the situation. His troops are currently stationed in the Seventh and Third Forts, which belong to Huai'an County, only 20 li away from Chaigoubao. There are a total of 2,800 soldiers and more than 1,300 horses. Jin troops are stationed locally and have formally formed a joint defense with our troops. The area is still peaceful, and the Japanese army has no significant activity. The occupation of Zhaojiayingzi in Longdousuo this time was expected. Longmensuo is only 40 li away from Chicheng and has mountains and the Great Wall. The area within the pass is extremely dangerous. Also, when Liu Guitang left Chicheng, he planned to secretly execute himself and Zhang Shusheng, sending four soldiers to monitor them. Fortunately, Brigade Commander Xia rescued them. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Unify Aggression Propaganda</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) For the sake of unifying aggression propaganda, Japan has established the East Asia North China United General Society in Dalian, with branches in Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, and Wuhan. The Beiping and Tianjin branches are headed by Japanese Ogawa, pseudo-rebel Shi Luben, and Hong Youxian. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>

The purpose is to have Japan as the representative, unite all Asian nations to resist the white race, and to hold a preparatory meeting in Dalian on February 1. This is closely related to Pu Yi's proclaiming himself emperor and is the vanguard of invading our country. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>English Times Newspaper Commentary</p>
<h3>The Issue of the Pseudo-Manchu Usurpation</h3>
<p>(London) This morning, The Times published a lengthy editorial commenting on the issue of the restoration of the Qing Dynasty in Manchuria. It first explained the reason for Japan's support of the imperial system, stating: "European and American countries regard 'Manchukuo' as a puppet in the hands of the Japanese, or as a Japanese colony. Japanese politicians believe that after the declaration of the imperial system, the status of the new organization of Manchuria will be elevated and have a more lasting appearance. Japanese politicians also believe that two results can be obtained after Manchuria declares an imperial system. Firstly, the world is deeply afraid that Japan will eventually annex Manchuria. Now that Manchuria has declared an imperial system, this fear can be eliminated. Secondly, a part of Japanese public opinion supports the annexation of Manchuria and is quite inflammatory. Now that the imperial system has been declared, this kind of incitement can also be stopped." The Times then stated its own opinion, saying that although Japan admits it does not want to make Manchuria a colony, it may satisfy some people, but whether the current relationship between Japan and "Manchukuo" will not change after the political system of Manchuria changes, European and American public opinion does not dare to lightly believe and still awaits further proof. On the Chinese side, the restoration of Manchuria is enough to worry the majority of Republicans, because Manchuria is close to the old capital of China and is indeed a threat at the flanks. Moreover, the restoration of Manchuria is tantamount to refusing to recognize China's sovereignty over Manchuria again. This will not only fail to improve relations between China and Japan but also increase the difficulties for those who intend to find a temporary solution between China and Japan and "Manchukuo."

After disembarking, he went to the Japanese Embassy to rest. The plane was piloted back to Chengde by pilot Saito at 10:40. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Takahashi said, "The rumor that I am a military officer stationed in Rehe is incorrect. I only recently received orders from the government to come to China and be stationed. I departed from Tokyo on December 27th of last year to inspect various places in the three eastern provinces, and then transferred to Chengde. I flew to Beiping this morning from Chengde. I will stay in Beiping for two or three days, then go to Tianjin, and then to Jinan and Qingdao to take a sea route to Shanghai. I am scheduled to arrive in Nanjing at the end of this month." When asked by reporters whether there was a plan for the Japanese side to send Puyi into China after his enthronement, Takahashi replied, "This statement is absolutely untrue. The authorities of Manchukuo only know how to maintain peace within the country, and the intention of the Japanese imperial authorities is also the same. There is absolutely no such thing as inviting the chief executive to enter China." (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Major Takahashi flew to Beiping by military aircraft No. 14 from Chengde at 10:30 a.m. on the 17th and landed at Nanyuan.

<p>Zhongxing Mining Tax Office</p>
<h3>Monthly Salary Increase</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 17th to the Administrative and Supervisory Yuan to investigate the Zhongxing Mining Tax Office. From January 21st to June 22nd, the tax revenue exceeded the budget by more than 70%, and the results were remarkable. It had requested to issue bonuses to the staff to encourage them.

<p>Japanese and Puppet Troops in the War Zone</p>
<h3>Organize Special Service Agencies</h3>
<p>Specializing in Investigating Anti-Japanese Activities and Connecting with Puppet Troops</p>
<p>A Beiping dispatch states that since the signing of the ceasefire agreement between China and Japan, the war zone should have been returned to our country by the Japanese side long ago. However, Yuguan and various passes on the Great Wall have been negotiated repeatedly by the North China authorities and the Japanese side since last winter until now, but there has been no result. During this time, the Japanese and puppet troops have intensified their activities in various counties within the war zone along the Great Wall passes. According to a secret investigation by a certain party, from December 26th of last year to the beginning of this month, puppet troops in seven places in Tangshan, Linyu, Luanxian, Funing, Qian'an, Zunhua, and Sanhe dispatched troops to set up agencies and carry out various activities. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Tangshan (1) The Japanese Army Garrison Headquarters in Tangshan plans to organize a special service agency specializing in investigating anti-Japanese activities and contacting puppet troops. It can be established after Yang Yuling returns to Tangshan. Yang Yuling once served as the liaison section chief of Li Jichun's troops. (2) Li Jichun, Liu Zuozhou, Zhao Lei, and others have news of going to Tangshan to organize a liaison office. (3) The Japanese Military Police Sub-Station in Tangshan City currently employs many Chinese people specializing in investigating anti-Japanese activities. (4) There is a long-distance bus operated by the Japanese in Tangshan City, traveling between Fengrun and Yutian. (5) The War Zone Security Team frequently goes to Shenyang, with unknown missions. (6) There are more than 300 old troops of Li Jichun stationed in Xiaoji Town, more than 30 miles southeast of Tangshan, with more than 100 rifles, led by Ma Hanzhang and Sha Dabao. (7) Gambling is rampant in Tangshan City. More than 100 gamblers were arrested last time. Recently, openly gambling places in Beishan have gradually increased again. (8) There are about 200 Japanese and Korean stores in Tangshan City, most of which gamble and sell drugs.</p>
<p>▲Linyu (1) The Jiukoumen is stationed with a part (one squadron) of the 14th Brigade, equipped with communication equipment and military vehicles. From north of Yuguan, pedestrians are prohibited from passing through, seemingly becoming a fortress area. (2) More than 600 newly arrived puppet troops were stationed in Dongluo City on December 27th. (3) Recently, rumors have been rampant in Yuguan, and residents have been moving away.</p>
<p>▲Luanxian (1) There are about 150 officers and soldiers in the Luanxian Garrison, with more than 130 rifles and six machine guns, stationed in Daonan and Daobei. There is a radio station in the South Camp. The commander is Captain Shimizu. (2) The Kwantung Army Logistics Sub-Station is located in Luanxian, responsible for transporting matters from Xifengkou to Rehe by Matsuda Kikuma.

(4) The transportation of the Luan River is managed by the Luan River Transportation Management Office, which is directly under the Kwantung Army Branch Supervisory Department. (5) Japanese troops frequently travel to and from the Luan River Railway Bridge.</p>
<p>▲Funing (1) A part of the 14th Brigade of the Kwantung Army is stationed at Jielingkou, about a small group. (2) The Japanese troops in Taitouying have all withdrawn to Jianchangying, claiming that the area is a buffer zone when they withdrew. (3) According to a report from Qiangou Town on December 26th, there are about 1,000 bandits such as [Black Dragon], [Little Pug], and [Jinshuidian] occupying the area.</p>
<p>▲Qian'an No Japanese or puppet troops are stationed at Lengkou and its nearby passes. However, the Japanese troops in Jianchangying strictly check pedestrians at Lengkou and its nearby passes, and boundary markers are built at each pass, with the words [Manchukuo Border North from Here] and [Wangdao Paradise] and other slogans.</p>
<p>▲Zunhua (1) On January 6th, Hirazawa Kiichi, the new captain of the 30th Regiment of the Sazhi Brigade stationed in Malanyu, led more than 20 soldiers and two companies of puppet troops to Shimen Town, claiming to be there to prevent Liu Guitang. (2) After the puppet troops stationed in Malanyu were taken over by the Second Battalion (Song Dingming) of the Second Regiment of the Rehe Garrison Army (Brigade Commander Zhang Junzhe, son of Zhang HaiPeng), the original Third Battalion of the regiment, which was stationed there, was still stationed in Zunhua and returned to Jianchangying on the 28th.</p>
<p>▲Sanhe (1) Chiba Noriyoshi, the special service battalion commander of the 11th Squadron of the Sazhi Brigade, and Tozawa Irusan Hideo, led 40 soldiers, one cart, and three Chinese, arrived in Sanhe at 5 p.m. on the 5th from Malanyu via Jixian, stationed in the Silimen area, and hired locals to lead them to Zhanggezhuang, Yutian, Pinggu, and other areas to scout the terrain.

<h3>Guangdong Troops are Assembled and Enter Fujian</h3>
<p>Under the Command of Huang Renhuan</p>
<p>The Huang and Li Divisions are the Main Force</p>
<p>A Shantou dispatch reports that after the Central Army occupied Yanping Shuikou, drastic changes occurred inside Fujian Province. The troops of Zhang Yan, Qu Shounian, and others in southern Fujian have all entered the coastal area of ​​Putian and Xianyou. The garrison in Zhangzhou and Longyan is empty. Xiamen has been garrisoned by the navy. The 19th Route Army only maintains the line from Zhangzhou to Tong'an, Jiangdong Bridge, and along the railway to Shima. The four counties of Dongshan, Zhao'an, Yunxiao, and Zhangpu have also been recovered by the old troops of Zhang Zhen using the strength of the militia. The county magistrate of Zhao'an, Yang Bokhan, the county magistrate of Yunxiao, Hu Pinsan, and the county magistrates of Dongshan and Zhangpu have all fled to Xiamen. The counties in southern Fujian have recently fallen into a state of anarchy. Local militiamen have risen up one after another, all claiming to be the Fujian Anti-Rebel Army of Southern Fujian, designated by the Central Government, with the name of a certain detachment or company. Zhang Bingzhen, who calls himself the Second Detachment, united Wu Shan's Shen Donghai troops in Erdu, Zhao'an County, and launched an offensive with considerable momentum. The people are extremely uneasy. Many Fujianese have moved to Huanggang and Chaoshan in Guangdong Province. Zhang Ruigui's division, Zhong Fangjun's regiment, is stationed in Raoping County, guarding the Fenshui Pass. The pass is on the mountain, and the terrain is very majestic. Since last month, Zhong's troops have been digging trenches and building fortifications at the pass, and sentries have been placed in Zhao'an territory, only seven or eight miles away from the county seat, to protect the land transportation between Fujian and Guangdong. Recently, the local area in southern Fujian has been chaotic. The Central Government telegraphed Guangdong to send troops into Fujian to maintain local order. Cai Tingkai also telegraphed Guangdong, requesting Guangdong troops to enter western Fujian to suppress the communist bandits, because the original Xie Dingxin regiment of the 19th Route Army was in the Longyan area, and the regiment has now been transferred elsewhere. The Fujian side hopes that the Guangdong troops will enter the area to prevent the bandits in Changting and Liancheng from taking the opportunity to invade. Due to the needs of the times and the urging of both sides, the Chaoshan Guangdong troops have decided to enter Fujian under the command of Huang Renhuan. The greatest purpose is nothing more than to prevent and suppress communist bandits and maintain local order. As for the deployment situation, Zhang Ruigui, the division commander stationed in Chaozhou, has been holding meetings at the division headquarters for days. On the 10th, he inspected the trenches on the Phoenix Mountain at the junction of Chao'an and Raoping, and inspected the troops stationed at Hukou Mountain in Huanggang along the Chaoqian Road to Qiandong. On the 12th, he went to the Huanggang regiment headquarters and inspected Fenshui Pass, and additionally transferred a regiment to Raoping County, which can enter Fujian at any time. In addition, Huang Renhuan's division, which was originally stationed in Shanghang, Wuping, and Jiaoling, has also been ordered to move. Li Zhenliang's division stationed in Xingning and Wuhua has moved to Dapu and entered Yongding. It is heard that the Huang and Li divisions are the main force entering Fujian. The two regiments of the Li Division that were originally stationed in Lianhe and Ping have now been transferred to Xingning. The upper reaches of the Dongjiang River are all stationed by Chen Zhang's brigade, in joint defense with Longguang's division in Huiyang. The Guangdong troops entering the Fujian army are currently being deployed. It is said that Huang Renhuan is responsible for commanding the troops, and Li Yangjing is responsible for the military affairs of the Fujian-Jiangxi border bandits. Zhang Ruigui is still responsible for the Chaoshan coast. Recently, many machine guns, mortars, and bullets have been shipped from Guangzhou and distributed to the troops entering Fujian for replenishment. The warehouse at the Meixian airport has been completed, and all the aircraft of the Fifth Squadron have gathered in Meixian, flying over western Fujian and southern Jiangxi every day to investigate. The Guangzhou Air Force has transferred another Second Squadron to Shantou for long-term stationing, specializing in reconnaissance in southern Fujian. The troop movements have been extremely busy in recent days. The postal and telegraph offices have added many inspectors. Military movements and the comings and goings of officers are absolutely not allowed to be sent. Private letters involving the political situation or discussing current affairs are given special attention by the inspectors. (12th)</p>

<h3>Night Assault on Bandit Liu</h3>
<p>Bandit Liu Briefly Raided Shandong Province</p>
<p>Refugees from Southern Hebei Fled to Linqing</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Guitang's bandit gang, originally a group of so-called "Green Forest heroes" in southern Shandong, has transitioned between banditry and military service countless times. This time, starting from Chicheng in the south, they are harassing the border between Hebei and Shandong, aiming to return to their old nest at Baodugang in southern Shandong, or to go to Henan to join the bandit gang of Cui Bangjie. Xia Ziming's brigade, formerly under Liu, has surrendered to the government but did not accompany Liu. However, according to reports, Liu is still leading no fewer than three to four thousand men, with mortars, machine guns, cavalry, and infantry, still resembling an army. The places they have passed through in recent days have mostly been completely looted. Localities that welcome and entertain them are only chosen for wealthy ransom demands. Once Liu leaves, resistance or interception leads to widespread looting and brutal village massacres. They disarm local militias and police, and incorporate bandits and vagrants into their ranks. As of today (the 15th), reports indicate that Bandit Liu is still in southern Hebei. If they don't flee back to Shandong, they will certainly enter Henan. The troops of the three provinces have been mobilized to encircle and suppress them. On the Shandong side, there are the 74th Division under Li Hanzhang, the 81st Division under Zhan Shutang, the 2nd Route Militia under Zhao Renquan, the Cavalry Regiment under Li Xuande, and the Provincial Border United Village Association, all cooperating in blocking and suppressing. Bandit Liu has been observing for several days but has not dared to enter Shandong rashly. However, small groups of three or five bandits occasionally slip through to cause harm, but these have been quickly dealt with. According to a telephone report from Linqing at 9:00 PM tonight (the 15th), the main force of Bandit Liu was lingering in the Laoguanzhai area of Weixian County in southern Hebei this morning (the 15th). That location is only eighty li from Linqing, forty li from Xiabusi, a subordinate town of Linqing, seventy li from Qiulin in Shandong, and forty-five li from Matou Town in Qiuxian County. After receiving the report, Zhao Renquan, the Deputy Commander of the Northern Shandong Garrison and Commander of the 2nd Route Militia, immediately led his directly controlled Mixed Regiment and Li Xuande's Cavalry Regiment out of Shandong Province, advancing towards Weixian to intercept and suppress Bandit Liu. Upon hearing the news, Bandit Liu immediately fled southwest from Weixian, and around noon, they actually occupied Matou Town in Qiuxian County, Shandong. Zhao led his troops in hot pursuit, and by evening, Liu's forces had retreated from Shandong Province (Matou Town is only twenty-five li from Qiuxian City) and fled to Quzhou County in Hebei Province (forty-five li from Qiuxian County), occupying the Longtang Town area. They stayed there that night, and Zhao continued to lead his troops in relentless pursuit. That evening, the 2nd Route Militia and Li Xuande's Cavalry Regiment advanced to Zhen Dongbao and were in the midst of a night assault. Longtang Town, occupied by Bandit Liu, is forty li from Quzhou and northeast of Quzhou City. According to a telephone call from Liaocheng, Sun Tonggang and Wang Zuwen flew over western Shandong in Airplane No. 2 today to scout out bandit activity. They saw over a thousand of Bandit Liu's men north of Qiuxian City, appearing to be fleeing back to southern Hebei, and have reported this to the provincial authorities.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Li Hanzhang, the Commander of the 74th Division and Commander of the Northern Shandong Garrison, arrived in Linqing this afternoon (the 15th) from Dezhou to command the various troops and militias in suppressing Bandit Liu. People from Weixian County and Quzhou County in southern Hebei are fleeing to Linqing to seek refuge, bringing the old and the young in an endless stream. Their descriptions of Bandit Liu's devastation are extremely tragic, with massacres and looting leaving nine out of ten homes empty, causing great sorrow (15th).</p>
<h3>Great Victory in Suppressing Bandits in Southern Hubei</h3>
<p>丨Refugees from Eastern Hubei Resettle and Cultivate Land in Northern Hubei丨</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After suffering setbacks in Puqi and Chongyang, the remaining bandits in southern Hubei, led by Zhang Shou, the self-proclaimed Third Division Commander, and Ye Jinbo, the Deputy Commander of the Jiangxi-Hubei Division, fled to the Mushigang, Zhengjunyou, and Yaji Mountain areas of Yangxin County. Chen Jicheng commanded the 26th Division under Guo Rudong, the New 7th Brigade under Li Zongjian, and the 33rd Brigade under Liu Peixu to jointly encircle and suppress them, and the bandits were defeated again. Chen sent a telegram to Hankou on the 15th reporting the victory, stating briefly: "The bandits' Third Division and Jiangxi-Hubei Division, numbering about four to five thousand men with over three thousand guns, began crossing the river at Qiaopu on the 11th. They were intercepted by our troops and pursued to Zouma Li, Wangwen, and Zijing Mountain. Our troops encircled and suppressed them on all sides, engaging in fierce combat throughout the day, with bayonet charges, routing the bandits. In this battle, Li Zongjian's New 7th Brigade captured over 270 rifles, over 20 pistols, and 1 machine gun, and captured alive the bandits' Third Division Chief of Staff, one Regimental Commander, and one Operations Section Chief. Guo Rudong's 26th Division and Liu Peixu's 37th Brigade also captured hundreds of guns, banners, and a large amount of baggage. In total, four to five hundred guns were captured, and three to four hundred men were captured alive. This battle is the first major victory in bandit suppression in southern Hubei in recent years," and so on.</p>
<p>The remaining bandits in eastern Hubei have now been completely annihilated, and the number of civilians moving out of the bandit areas is increasing daily. They will all be moved to northern Hubei, where they will be given land to cultivate. According to investigations, there are over 400,000 mu of public wasteland in northern Hubei. In northern Xiangyang alone, there are over 300,000 mu, and in the southeastern part, there are 70,000 mu. Giving each person ten mu of land would be more than enough to accommodate the existing 20,000-plus people. In addition, there are 700 mu of wasteland in Wuchang in southern Hubei, 7,700 mu in Jiayu, 1,300 mu in Jianli in western Hubei, 40 mu in Qishui in eastern Hubei, 140 mu in Yingcheng in central Hubei, and 500 mu in Anlu, Yunmeng, and Baokang in northern Hubei, which could accommodate over 10,000 more refugees (16th).</p>

<h3>The Chen Family in Tanpailou Was Robbed</h3>
<p>Four bandits with painted faces broke into the Chen Xueqi family home in Tanpailou of this city on the night of the 16th, digging a hole in the wall and entering the inner room. The owner, Chen Xueqi, woke up upon hearing the noise, but was unable to resist the bandits. They broke into the inner room and stole two gold rings and fifty silver dollars before fleeing with a whoop. By the time the winter defense police were notified, it was too late to track them down.</p>

<h3>Murderer Executed by Hanging</h3>
<p>Liu Gensan from Yixing knew Xu Shuangxi from the same village. Due to lending relationships, there was some animosity. Xu had a neighbor, Wang Laowu, who made a living selling red pills. Because Xu often made false claims, on June 3rd of the 21st year [of the Republic], he bribed Liu to Xu's home, using the excuse of going to listen to storytelling outside Zhongshan Gate together, inviting Xu out. Together with two unnamed red pill peddlers from Changzhou, they dragged Xu to the back of the Tianhou Temple, hacked him to death with a knife, and placed the body in an old coffin in the Yizhong cemetery, hoping to cover up their traces. Later, village chief Tan Hongzhang discovered it and reported it to the district, who arrested Liu and brought him to the county government for interrogation. He was sentenced to death. Liu refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. After three trials, the appeals were rejected. Yesterday (the 17th) at 8:00 AM, the High Court sent prosecutor Zhan Dufen to supervise the police in executing Liu by hanging at the Third Sub-prison execution ground.</p>
<h3>Sailing Boat Robbed in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 16th) at 10:00 AM, a sailing boat traveling from Xishan to Suzhou was passing the Yushan area by the lake when it was suddenly encountered by a bandit boat with ten male bandits and one female bandit on board. They were disguised and armed, and they moved the cargo on the boat to their boat, causing a loss of several hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>Fire in Dazhi Alley</h3>
<p>There are thirteen households in Dazhi Alley near the suspension bridge outside the west gate of this county. The night before (the 16th) at around 8:00 PM, Wu Afu, who sells beef, returned home to sleep. He accidentally knocked over the kerosene lamp on the table, causing it to ignite the bedding. It was impossible to put out the fire, and it quickly spread. The fire broke through the roof and the flames lit up the sky, spreading to the neighboring homes of Xi Jinbao, Wang A’quan, Wu Jida, Wu A’pang, Wu A’ting, Xi Rulin, Wu A’zhao, Wu A’kun, Zhang Fushou, and Wang A’san. When the fire brigades from various sections heard the alarm, they arrived at the scene to put out the fire. Because the fire was so intense, firefighters Wang Jingen and Mao Shanggen fell into the fire pit one after another. Fortunately, they were rescued, but they were seriously injured. Mao Shanggen's life is in danger and he is currently being treated at Puren Hospital. In total, eleven houses were burned down, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<h3>Problems Arise During Chamber of Commerce Re-election</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce recently held its re-election. Eight executive committee members were elected: Qian Sunqing, Wu Shimei, Cheng Jingdong, Jiang Huanqing, Li Zhongchen, Chen Zhanru, Wu Xiangqing, and Zhao Zixin. Four supervisory committee members were elected: Hua Shaochun, Ge Zicai, Chen Pinsan, and Cai Yourong. Before the voting, the county party headquarters stated that according to Article 19 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, the term of office for both executive and supervisory committee members is four years. If the term of the current chamber of commerce executive and supervisory committee members has not yet expired and an executive committee member is elected as a supervisory committee member, or a supervisory committee member is elected as an executive committee member during the re-election, would that election be valid? They telegraphed the provincial party headquarters for instructions and clarification. A reply telegram was received stating that if the above situation occurs, it would conflict with the Chamber of Commerce Law and should be declared invalid. The Chamber of Commerce was immediately instructed to act accordingly. However, the Chamber of Commerce believed that the matter concerned the interpretation of laws and regulations and that, according to legislative practice, it should be handled by the central government, not by the provincial or county authorities. They immediately telegraphed the central party headquarters, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry for instructions and clarification. As a result of this ballot count, the newly elected executive committee members included three current supervisory committee members: Qian Sunqing, Cheng Jingdong, and Chen Zhanru. If the provincial telegram is followed, then Wu Bangzhou, Xue Huidong, and Shen Xijun, who were the top three alternates, should fill the vacancies. The current Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to hold a joint meeting of the old and new executive and supervisory committees today (the 18th) to discuss everything. After the ballot results were announced, Qian Sunqing, one of the newly elected executive committee members and a former supervisory committee member, sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce stating that he wished to remain on the supervisory committee and did not wish to be elected as an executive committee member.</p>

<h3>Winter Relief Begins Distribution</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Winter Relief Committee has been organized and established for some time. The committee originally planned to begin distribution on the 15th of this month, but due to rain and mud, it was postponed to yesterday. To ensure thoroughness, the city and suburbs were divided into six groups, each led by a group leader and five or six staff members. After gathering at the Chamber of Commerce building at 8:00 AM, they went to their designated locations to distribute aid according to the addresses. Because the area is vast, it was not completed by evening. It is reported that the amount of aid distributed is based on the degree of poverty, divided into four grades: "Heaven," "Earth," "Harmony," and "Peace." The exact amounts for each grade will be determined after the number of households receiving each grade has been tallied.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Two Bookstores Unresolved</h3>
<p>Ye Jungu, the manager of the Baicheng Bookstore on Zhongshan Road, previously accused Zhou Renxi and Chen Xianting, the managers of the neighboring Zhonghe Bookstore, of arson with the intention of claiming insurance, harming neighboring stores and causing an innocent loss of over four thousand dollars. Unwilling to accept this, he filed a criminal complaint with the Prosecutor's Office. After the investigation was completed, no prosecution was initiated. Ye refused to accept the judgment and petitioned the High Court for reconsideration, but it was again rejected. Ye, believing that the evidence of the defendant's arson was conclusive, submitted the evidence and exhibits and continued to request reconsideration. Huang Yongzhong, the chief prosecutor of the court, rejected Ye's request, stating that it was not in accordance with the law. It is reported that Ye has now appealed according to law.</p>

<p>Flour Export Ban</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Implements Revocation</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs Notice</p>
<p>Effective Immediately, Abolished</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance did not revoke the flour export ban when it lifted the ban on rice and wheat exports. The Shanghai Flour Trade Association petitioned the Ministry of Finance to lift the ban as an example to promote foreign trade. The association has now been ordered to approve, and the Jianghai Customs has announced the revocation of the ban. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Flour Ban Lifted</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has approved the Flour Trade Association's request to allow flour exports, but the special tax will still be collected. The original approval order stated: "The ban on flour exports was originally implemented because of domestic disasters and insufficient food supplies. The Ministry was ordered to handle this matter. Now, there is a surplus of agricultural products in various regions, and the situation of sluggish sales is the opposite of what it was before. The request to lift the ban on the export of wheat flour of grades two, three, and four can be approved. However, wheat flour is not subject to customs duties. The current tax is still a special tax, which is clearly different from the customs duties levied on other grains. Therefore, a complete tax exemption cannot be granted. The special wheat flour tax shall continue to be collected as stipulated in the regulations, and half of the actually collected tax amount shall be refunded after export to encourage exports. As for bran, it is mostly used for industrial purposes, with a large volume exported annually. It has not been subject to the export ban and is of a different nature than grain. Therefore, it is difficult to grant the same tax exemption. Furthermore, the association petitioned for a tax exemption on bran exports in July of this year (the 22nd year of the Republic), and the Ministry rejected it. It should be handled in accordance with the original case. This approval is notified for information, in addition to being submitted and distributed."</p>
<h3>Customs Notice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jianghai Customs issued English notice No. 1334, abolishing the flour export ban from today. The original text is translated as follows: "Notice is hereby given that the previous ban on the export of wheat flour has now been revoked. All procedures for transporting wheat flour in various coastal areas that were originally established will be abolished from today. All other customs prices remain unchanged. This notice is issued by Tang Haian, Superintendent of Jianghai Customs, and Robert L. Paddock, Inspector General of Customs."</p>
<p>Purchasing American Wheat Flour</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Price Negotiations</h3>
<p>Manufacturers Appointed Gu Xinyi and Others as Representatives</p>
<p>To Negotiate with the American Cotton and Wheat Management Office</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that Shanghai flour manufacturers are purchasing 240,000 tons of American wheat and 6.4 million bags of American flour. On the 13th of this month, six conditions were presented and approved by the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that the flour and wheat have already arrived in Shanghai and could be shipped by the manufacturers themselves, but the unloading has been delayed due to unresolved price negotiations. A Xin Xin News Agency reporter learned that the manufacturers held a meeting on the 16th to decide on the quantity to be purchased by each factory and appointed Gu Xinyi and others as representatives to negotiate prices with Mr. Sidema, the director of the American Cotton and Wheat Management Office, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM so that each factory can ship the goods as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Soybean and Rice Trade Association</p>
<h3>Resolved to Subscribe for 50,000 Yuan in Shares</h3>
<p>The Grain Transportation and Marketing Bureau is Actively Proceeding</p>
<p>A Shareholders' Meeting Will Be Held After Share Payments are Collected</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the China Grain Transportation and Marketing Bureau, organized by eight provinces and cities, was originally scheduled to hold its inaugural shareholders' meeting on the 20th of this month, but the date has been postponed because the economic conditions of the provinces are strained and payments have not been remitted. A Xin Xin News Agency reporter visited Gu Xinyi, the director of the bureau's preparatory office, yesterday morning to inquire about the bureau's recent situation. He said that the subscriptions from various provinces and cities have been affected by the poverty caused by years of disasters in the neighboring bandit areas. However, grain transportation and marketing is a pressing issue for our country, so the provinces and cities are actively planning to remit the payments within this month. As for Shanghai, progress is also being made on various fronts. The Soybean and Rice Trade Association recently convened a meeting and decided to subscribe for 50,000 yuan in shares. Other associations, such as the Miscellaneous Grains Association, will also convene meetings, and the amount of their subscriptions will be decided at that time. As for the inaugural shareholders' meeting, it can be held as soon as the share payments are collected.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Fujian Merchants Trading</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Fujian Shipping Lines</p>
<p>Business is Quite Prosperous</p>
<p>For many years, Shanghai-Fujian merchants have frequently traded with each other in large quantities. This time, the Fujian Incident has affected the operations of Chinese ships, causing significant losses. It is reported that both Shanghai and Fujian merchants are actively exchanging telegrams to continue business, as the Central Army has successively recovered Yanping, Gutian, Fuzhou, and other places, and Chinese shipping companies such as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sanbei Steamship Company, and Ning Shao Steamship Company have gradually resumed the Shanghai-Fujian routes. Fuzhou's purchases from Shanghai are especially crowded. Therefore, ships sailing to Fuzhou and other places are fully loaded with goods, and business is very prosperous.</p>
<h3>Two Railways' Defenses are Consolidated</h3>
<p>There Should Be No Other Concerns</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the train robbery on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the public has been quite concerned about travel, especially on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, which are centered on Shanghai, connecting the capital to the north and Hangzhou to the south. They occupy important positions politically, militarily, commercially, and culturally, and are of particular concern. According to a reporter's investigation, the railway protection troops on these routes were slightly moved during the Fujian Incident. There was a time when the station at Benniu was robbed due to thin defenses, but national troops quickly filled the position. Now, all stations and bridges along the lines are heavily guarded by stationed troops, military police, or security teams, who are working closely with railway workers to conduct strict patrols. The number of police officers on both railways has also been increased to fill vacancies and strengthen armaments, and the police chiefs personally inspect the situation at any time to provide protection. Recently, the bureau has ordered the police chiefs to pay extra attention. In addition to military police protecting the trains, a considerable number of armed police officers are also assigned to guard the trains, ensuring that there will be no other concerns.</p>
<p>Following the Robbery of the Puan Steamer</p>
<h3>The Navy Dispatched Warships to Pursue and Suppress</h3>
<p>And Ordered the Rescue of the Nine Kidnapped Passengers</p>
<p>The Puan Steamer is Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Co.'s Puan steamer, which operates on the Shanghai-Qingdao line, departed from Shanghai on the 13th of this month and was hijacked by pirates eighteen nautical miles north of Sheweishan outside the Wusongkou. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning at 7:00 AM. The Navy has dispatched warships stationed in Xiamen to pursue and suppress the pirates and rescue the kidnapped passengers. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Hijack</h3>
<p>This morning, the Puan steamer was hijacked by pirates and forced to sail into the Zhaoan Bay in Fujian on the Shanghai-Guangdong line. The pirates used pre-arranged fishing boats to escape, taking nine passengers with them. The Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's radio station received a telegram from the Puan captain yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM stating that the Puan had sailed to the Zhoushan waters in Zhejiang Province and was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 7:00 AM this morning. It was originally intended to dock at the China Merchants North Line wharf, but it has now been decided to dock at the China Merchants Hua Line wharf in Pudong.</p>
<h3>Warships Dispatched</h3>
<p>After receiving news that the Puan steamer had been hijacked by pirates, the Navy Department telegraphed Xiamen to dispatch warships to Zhaoan Bay to pursue and suppress the pirates and rescue the kidnapped passengers. It also replied to the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It is reported that the Jiangyuan warship stationed in Xiamen has been ordered to sail to Zhaoan Bay to pursue and suppress the pirates. After receiving a telegram from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Ministry of Transportation inquired about the truth from the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company via long-distance telephone from Nanjing the night before and immediately consulted the Navy Department and the Fujian and Guangdong land and sea authorities to pursue and suppress the pirates and rescue the passengers.</p>
<h3>Purpose of the Kidnapping</h3>
<p>According to information gathered by a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, the pirates' purpose in hijacking the Puan steamer was to kidnap passengers. The nine kidnapped passengers are all men. One of them is a steerage passenger who was mistakenly kidnapped. When Sun Zhenwu, the director of the China Merchants Qingdao branch, disguised himself as a crew member, the pirates mistook him for a steerage passenger, leading to the mistaken kidnapping of the steerage passenger, Mr. Zhu, who was traveling from Shanghai to Laiyang for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Southwest Test Flight</p>
<h3>Will Retest Xikang</h3>
<p>So That New Aircraft Can Be Deployed Immediately</p>
<p>After being detained in Vietnam due to accidentally entering Vietnamese territory, the Southwest test flight of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) was released. Yesterday morning, after confirming the weather conditions in Kunming, the pilot, An Lisheng, and the flight director, Nie Kaiyi, flew back. It is expected to arrive in Chongqing tomorrow. It is reported that the company plans to open a flight route to Xikang Province on the border of Sichuan. After the aircraft returns to Chongqing, it will be used to retest Xikang. Then, it will return to Hankou, so that the new aircraft purchased from the United States can be formally deployed after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>North Shanghai</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Rice Transportation</h3>
<p>Workers Petitioned All Night</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Requested Intervention</p>
<p>A Conflict Was Unavoidable This Morning</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the dispute over rice shoulder-carrying in North Shanghai continues. The shoulder-carrying laborers' petition to the Social Affairs Bureau the day before failed, and they only returned yesterday morning. The rice merchants submitted a response to the Social Affairs Bureau for review in accordance with the meeting's decision. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned rice merchants from North Shanghai for questioning. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Petitioned for Days</h3>
<p>Over 120 shoulder-carrying laborers from the Hongtai Yuji Shoulder-Carrying Company petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau since the morning of the day before. The bureau registered them, but more than 40 of the laborers did not match the previously reported lists. The Social Affairs Bureau refused to register them, but these workers insisted on a solution before dispersing. Until 11:05 PM the night before, they remained gathered outside the Social Affairs Bureau. The Seventh District Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, fearing further complications, sent police to suppress them, but to no avail. They had no choice but to take them to the branch, where the chief repeatedly advised them. At 12:00 AM, they were escorted to the Jiangwan Seventh District Office. The workers had no choice but to walk back to the guildhall at Xinzha Bridge at 2:30 AM yesterday morning, arriving at 4:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Workers' Attitude</h3>
<p>According to Wang Dafu, the foreman of the Hongtai Shoulder-Carrying Company, speaking to a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, the more than 40 shoulder-carrying laborers who were not registered by the Social Affairs Bureau were laborers who had registered successively, so they were not included in the reported list. All merchants include foremen currently serving, and foremen often deny shoulder-carrying laborers because of their rights. Even relatives are treated as strangers. Yesterday's merchant meeting even heard claims that the foremen have guarantees and heavy responsibilities. This point contradicts the original intention of the Social Affairs Bureau to abolish contracting. The workers are determined to take effective measures to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Industry Representatives</h3>
<p>Rice merchants said that these shoulder-carrying laborers were all hired by Shi Dengfu, the foreman of the Hongtai Shoulder-Carrying Company. They have no fixed occupation and are deliberately trying to cause trouble for the merchants. Furthermore, the foremen who contract the rice transportation are responsible for compensation. For example, if a worker steals rice and escapes, the foreman is responsible for compensation. This custom has been used for a long time and is not easy to abolish. Yesterday's industry meeting decided to uniformly oppose the shoulder-carrying laborers in order to seek familiarity and stability.</p>
<h3>Submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>The industry associations of the soybean and rice trade, rice transportation, and rice milling jointly decided at a meeting the day before to uniformly reject the shoulder-carrying laborers. If the workers continue to cause trouble, they are prepared to suspend operations to deal with the situation. Yesterday morning, they jointly submitted the process to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. The Social Affairs Bureau also summoned rice transporters from North Shanghai at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>The import of artificial silk has increased daily.</p>
<h3>Our Country Urgently Needs to Establish Factories for Self-Production</h3>
<p>A Capital of One or Two Million Gold Can Be Used to Start the Business</p>
<p>Due to Water Needs, Factories Should Be Located in the Taihu Lake Basin</p>
<p>The New Voice Society reports that silk prices have plummeted in recent years, leading to a drastic decline, causing the rural economy to approach collapse. Farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have traditionally relied on silkworm rearing, cocoon sales, and silk reeling as a major source of income throughout the year. The reasons for the silk industry's failure are half due to the impact of artificial silk and half due to Japanese dumping in the United States, which has led to the occupation of overseas markets. A reporter interviewed Mr. Jiang Linshu, the manager of China New Printing and Dyeing Company, yesterday. According to him, the position of artificial silk today makes it impossible to eliminate. If countries such as Britain, the United States, Italy, and Japan establish factories to manufacture it, the quantity will be astonishing. The sales volume in Shanghai alone is as high as 400 boxes per day. Groups are promoting sales in our country's market, with fierce competition. If Chinese people do not establish factories for self-production, the outflow of money will be countless. The best raw material for manufacturing artificial silk is cotton, followed by pine trees, seaweed, and other slightly sticky plants. However, lake water is more suitable than seawater. Mr. Jiang is a giant in the silk industry. He visited Japan twice in his early years to observe their silk and artificial silk factories, carefully studying them and gaining a lot of experience. Mr. Jiang also said that he went to Japan five years ago when Japan newly established a large-scale artificial silk factory called "Asahi," with a capital of six million, half from the government and half from merchants. The factory was located on the shore of Lake Biwa. The lake is surrounded by mountains, with beautiful scenery, clean water, and waterfalls directly into the lake. The water quality is very good. When the factory opened, its machinery was also purchased from Europe and the United States, with a large scale and complete equipment. In less than a year, artificial silk from the Asahi factory was discovered in Shanghai. The Japanese are very dedicated to business, far beyond what we can match. Recently, there have been dozens of large and small artificial silk factories around Lake Biwa. Chinese merchants buy and use artificial silk, mostly from Italy and the United States. Recently, it may be difficult to avoid buying Japanese goods. Mr. Jiang spoke with great emotion and continued, saying that if our country wants to establish a factory for self-production, a capital of one or two million can be raised to start the business. Due to the water needs, the factory should be located in the Taihu Lake basin, rather than in Shanghai. Now that Chinese people are promoting domestic goods, there should be many enthusiastic and knowledgeable people in the business community. Why not quickly take action?</p>
<p>Representatives Jiang Shizhi and Jiang Zisheng from the Businessmen's Joint Association, the Bean and Rice Industry Shanghai North Office, and the Grain Dealers Association inquired about the situation in order to mediate.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Petition</h3>
<p>The Dagong Society reports that Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Bean and Rice Trade Association of this city, Zhu Zizhen, Chairman of the Rice Milling Industry Association, Jiang Shizhi, Chairman of the Grain Dealers Association, Jiang Zisheng, Director of the Bean and Rice Industry Shanghai North Office, Lu Jingwen, and other five people went to the city center yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to petition the municipal government, requesting a swift stop to the porters' competition for work to stabilize commerce. Secretary Feng Yuhong received them, inquired about the situation, and promised to instruct the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to properly handle the matter. Regarding the issue of placing unemployed workers, they will wait for detailed investigation and verification. The representatives expressed their satisfaction before returning.</p>
<h3>Sending Police for Protection</h3>
<p>Because the problem of placing all the unemployed porters still has no concrete solution, they will go to the rice shops and factories in the Xin Zha Bridge and Wu Zhen Road area this morning to request work. After learning of this news, the rice industry was deeply concerned that it would cause renewed disputes and affect people's livelihoods. They immediately reported to the Fourth District Headquarters of the Public Security Bureau, requesting that police be sent to protect the work. After learning the situation, District Chief Lai has notified the nearby police station to send more police officers to the rice industry docks this morning to protect the work and maintain people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters believes that Shi Dengfu's repeated leading of crowds to compete for porter work is a major issue for local security. Yesterday, it specifically sent Lu Yinchu, an officer from the People's Military Affairs Section, to the various rice industry groups to inquire about the situation in detail and thoroughly investigate Shi Dengfu's actions in order to take strict action.</p>

<p>National Goods Match Reward Method</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Temporary Suspension of Discussion</h3>
<p>The All-China National Goods Match Industry Joint Association previously reported that the national goods match industry was declining due to the dumping of foreign matches. Recently, match unified taxes have been increased, and manufacturers feel that the burden on capital use is particularly heavy. It was submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting a prompt decision to implement the national goods match reward method to provide relief. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance replied, "Received the report, checked that the match tax increase was implemented simultaneously for domestic and imported products. Since the tax rate is not biased, it should not be affected by the inability to compete. The request to decide to implement the national goods match reward method will be temporarily suspended for discussion. Please be informed. This is approved, January 15, 23rd year of the Republic of China, Minister Kong Xiangxi.</p>

<p>Various Groups Gather to Discuss</p>
<h3>Methods to Commemorate Mr. Yao Zirang</h3>
<p>Decided Date for Memorial Service</p>
<p>Publicly Agreed on the Posthumous Title [Gong Jing]</p>
<p>Planned to Build a Statue to Last Forever</p>
<p>The Preparatory Office for the Memorial Service of Mr. Yao Zirang held its second preparatory meeting at the China Vocational School yesterday (16th) at 4:00 PM. In addition to the original 12 sponsoring groups, including the China Vocational Education Society, the Shanghai Charity Group, the Security Regiment, and the Firefighting United Association, the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer, the County Government, the Shanghai Municipal Timber Trade Association, the Universal Chinese Student Association, the Farmers' Education Center, Guangyi Hospital, Jianhua Hospital, Nanyang, Minli, Aiqun, Si Sheng, Huiqun and other schools joined, for a total of more than fifty groups. Individual participants included Shen Enfu, Fang Jiaobo, Lu Wenshao, Zhu Shaoping, Ling Bohua, Yao Huiquan, Qu Shaoyi, Mao Zijian, Shi She, Li Youzhi, Jia Foru, Yu Baoqing, Huang Yunzhen, Zhang Zhujun, Wang Qizhang China Airlines</p>
<h3>Longhua Air and Sea Port Completed</h3>
<p>The Location of the Port is Suitable, and the Area is Extremely Large</p>
<p>Currently Cooperating with the City Government to Develop the City</p>
<p>China Airlines, for the upcoming success of Sino-American Aviation, has built a grand Far East air and sea port on the waters of Longhua. Construction on the port has been underway for some time, and the flight path has now been completed. All facilities are largely complete, and it is planned to cooperate with the municipal government to operate secondary businesses. After it is successful, it can become the only air and sea port in the Far East.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Entire Port</h3>
<p>The entire port is located near the Longhua Shanghai-Hangzhou Line station. The area was formerly the Huangpu River and later Longhua Town, with both water and land available. The location is excellent. The total area of the port is several thousand feet and has now been paved for airplanes to land. A small portion of the waterfront in front has been built into a cement gate for the purpose of stopping planes.</p>
<h3>Building the Water and Land Port</h3>
<p>The water port has been completed after hard work. The so-called water port is only the water surface of the Huangpu River. No ships pass through this area. A narrow water railing floats on the surface of the port, specifically for pilots to walk on and off. The land port next to this water port occupies a very large area. A narrow flight path has now been built to allow airplanes to take off into the air from the path.</p>
<h3>Developing the City</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate travelers and develop Longhua, the company is now planning to build upscale boarding houses, dining halls, clubs, and various entertainment facilities on the open space of the port. However, this is a major undertaking, and the economic aspect is particularly important, and it is also closely related to municipal facilities. Therefore, it has been discussed with the municipal government once, intending to cooperate fully to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>More than one hundred people, including Yao Xinzhi, publicly elected Qin Yanqi, the representative of the Shanghai Charity Group, as the chairman. The following important cases were resolved: (1) The date of the memorial service was decided to be March 18th at 2:00 PM. (2) The location of the memorial service was decided to be at the China Vocational Education Center. (3) The preparatory staff was designated as three groups, including the China Vocational Education Society. (4) The preparatory expenses were decided (omitted). (5) The posthumous title of Mr. Yao Zirang was publicly discussed and it was resolved to be [Gong Jing], meaning [being resolute in one's duties is called Gong, and being respectful and refraining from unnecessary speech is called Jing]. (6) Building a statue for commemoration to last forever was approved in principle. The specific plan will be solicited from various groups and discussed at the next meeting.</p>

<p>Women's National Goods Movement</p>
<h3>Propaganda Rally Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Attended by Over Five Thousand People, Extremely Crowded</p>
<p>Lianhua Company Filmed on the Spot</p>
<p>The Women's National Goods Movement Propaganda Rally, sponsored by the First Special District Citizens' Union of this city, opened at the City Chamber of Commerce Hall yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, attended by more than five thousand ladies from all walks of life, which was a grand occasion. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>The attendees yesterday included Wang Yansong, Ye Jiaxing, He Bingxian (Ji Zize Jin Dynasty), Lin Kecong, Shu Huizhen, Wu Zhihao, Chen Jicheng, Cao Zhigong, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, Yu Zhongxian, Chen Binghui, Yin Jialiang, Sun Mingqi, Fang Peicheng, Chen Shude, Leng Bingnan, Wang Jian'e, Zhu Baoluo, Zhu Yangwu, Tao Leqin, Ren Nongxuan, Liu Zhongying, Tan Dongshan, Zhu Zhichun, etc.</p>
<h3>Crowded Guests</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the association also invited the mayor's wife, Madam Wu, to perform the opening ceremony. Ms. Tang Guanyu, Ms. Li Caiyun, Ms. Shu Jinzhen, Ms. Lin Kecong, and Lin Kanghou, Ma Junshuo, Xu Xiaochu, Tong Xingbai, and female stars gave speeches and performances. However, because the guests were crowded yesterday, and the situation was like a tide, it was difficult to maintain order, which made it impossible to receive guests separately. And those who were supposed to speak could not move forward, and left in a hurry. Therefore, it was not possible to implement the speeches and performances.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>The presidium of the conference consisted of Wu Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Ye Jiaxing, Zhang Yichen, Wu Zhihao, Yu Zhongxian, Hu Fengxiang, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binghui, Wang Hanliang, Chen Jicheng, Cao Zhigong, and other twelve people. The master of ceremonies was Chen Jiufeng, and the recorder was Zheng Dongshan. After Wang Hanliang reported the purpose of the meeting, Wang Yansong, Ye Jiaxing, and He Bingxian (Ji Dynasty) delivered speeches in succession.</p>
<h3>Wang Yansong's Speech</h3>
<p>Wang Yansong said in his speech, "Brothers, I am participating in the Women's National Goods Movement Conference today, and I am one of the presidium. Because I have not fully understood the past preparation process, I will no longer report to you. I would like to contribute my personal views to the guests. First, today's conference is an organized movement to promote the development of national goods. All guests, regardless of men, women, old, or young, should adhere to this meaning and take a responsibility to promote national goods, set an example, and gradually promote them throughout the country. Second, the name of this association is the Women's National Goods Movement Propaganda Conference, but its meaning is broad, not narrow. Because promoting national goods is a natural duty that any of the 400 million compatriots should bear. Just because this year is designated as the Women's National Goods Year, it should be promoted by women and should not be unrelated to men. We know that saving the country through national goods is the urgent task of the moment. All compatriots should have the same goal, not let others go first, and work hard. Especially men, who have more service experience and deeper impressions in society, should understand the importance of promoting and using national goods and intensify their efforts. As for the responsibility of women, in terms of the family, all procurement and purchase matters are exclusively authoritative. In the past, various products in the family, especially cosmetics, can be said to be mostly imported. This may be due to the lack of knowledge of a few people, resulting in it. If they can take advantage of today, the Women's National Goods Year, to unanimously wake up and work hard to promote national goods, so that the effect of today's conference can be carried forward and achieve the goal of saving the country through national goods, this is what I am willing to encourage with you all."</p>
<h3>Ye Jiaxing's Speech</h3>
<p>Ye Jiaxing said in his speech, "At the beginning of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, we designated this year as the National Goods Year, and we have spared no effort in promotion and publicity throughout the year. But in reality, the excess of foreign goods is still increasing. To put it bluntly, the effect can be said to be very slight. Therefore, based on the experience of this failure, we believe that the promotion of national goods in the future must change its direction and start with the women's sector itself. There are two reasons for this: First, modern housekeeping, no matter how the family is organized, is controlled by women. Therefore, how to purchase food, clothing, and entertainment products is mostly determined by the housewife, and men do not have any prejudices. Therefore, if women love to use national goods, there is no reason to abandon national goods and go for foreign goods in the family. This is one reason. The other reason is that women are rich in the psychology of loving beauty, and the novelty and ostentation of foreign goods are also what those who love beauty like to pursue. And there is an unbreakable concept in society that foreign goods are exquisite and cannot be compared with national goods. This concept, if allowed to spread and expand, is actually an invisible obstacle to national goods. Therefore, we must universally publicize the beauty and applicability of national goods to the women's sector to correct their misconceptions. This is the second reason. At the same time, because women in our country have always been rich in the virtues of thrift and saving money, men's squandering of money is often enlightened by the character and influence of women. Although this trend has gradually disappeared in the cities in recent years, most can still maintain this virtue. Therefore, if women can switch to using national goods, it can indirectly create a social atmosphere of thrift and integrity for men. This is the third reason. The above is the origin of our advocacy for the women's national goods movement. I hope that the ladies will work hard, etc." Other speeches were omitted.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Program</h3>
<p>Future entertainment will be performed to add to the fun. (1) Zhong Xin Xiao Liu Kuaile's "Moonlight Chasing Stars." (2) Zhu Xiangfei and He Shuangdai's "Hula Dance." (3) Li Dasheng, Chen Jifu, Chen Jiqing, and Ling Yun of the Shanghai National Goods Company's "Forty Gold." (4) Ms. Yu Guxiang, Ms. Chen Shengde, and Ms. Gu Songya's magic show. (5) National martial artists Ren Chaojun and Luo Ruixing's martial arts show. (6) Ren Jingju and Li Dasheng's "National Goods Song." (7) Ye Zhiyong's "Wang Wuneng's Farewell to His Wife." (8) Zhang Zhier's Comedy. (9) Chinese National Goods Company employees' Peking Opera (New Picking Up Gold) and Singing (Women's National Goods Year). (10) Modern drama (Awakening), especially Zhang Xianglu and Hu Beiqi's expressions were the best.</p>
<h3>Filming</h3>
<p>Huaou Candy Company, China Chemical Industry Society, Huacheng, Nanyang, and other companies donated national goods items in the venue. Because there were not many items prepared, they were quickly used up. Those who came later got nothing. All entertainment was filmed by Lianhua Company for mobile news footage to promote it to various places.</p>
<h3>Slogans</h3>
<p>(1) This year is the Women's National Goods Year. (2) Today is the general mobilization of the Women's National Goods Movement. (3) Women compatriots, let's all promote national goods together. (4) Are you Chinese? Why don't you use Chinese goods? (5) Promoting national goods is to resist foreign goods. (6) Hating foreign goods is the weapon to kill us. (7) To save the country, passively resist foreign goods. (8) To save the country, actively promote national goods. The radio also broadcasted speeches by Ye Jiaxing and Lu Zhongcheng on the Great China Broadcasting Station, titled "Women's National Goods Movement."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Actively Preparing</p>
<h3>Pudong Tap Water</h3>
<p>Discussed Preparation Methods at the Bank Club Yesterday</p>
<p>Seven Research Committee Members were Appointed to Plan Together</p>
<p>Pudong's commerce is thriving, and the number of residents is increasing. The tap water project has not yet been prepared, which is of great importance to the residents' health and fire protection. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, in view of this, specifically summoned the leaders of the city's banking industry and Pudong gentry and merchants to the Bank Club at No. 4 Hong Kong Road yesterday afternoon to discuss the implementation plan. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu and Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, hosted a banquet for Pudong gentry, merchants, and leaders of the city's banking industry at the Bank Club yesterday to discuss the funding plan for Pudong tap water. More than thirty people, including Tang Shoumin, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Gongquan, Xu Xinliu, Pan Zhiwen, Yao Mulian, and Du Yuesheng, attended.</p>
<h3>Director's Report</h3>
<p>During the banquet, Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, reported on behalf of Mayor Wu on the need for tap water in Pudong and the budget. He said that Pudong and Puxi are separated by a river and have a very close relationship. Because land prices in Puxi are expensive and the cost of living is high, developing Pudong can adjust the prosperity of Puxi. Moreover, tap water is very important to the safety and health of residents. The failure to prepare it so far is a great obstacle to the prosperity of Pudong. Now the municipal government plans to raise 300,000 yuan to complete this project. I hope that all the leaders present can invest enthusiastically to promote its success.</p>
<h3>Forming a Committee</h3>
<p>All the attendees believed that Mayor Wu's move was deeply needed by the residents of Pudong and were willing to help as much as possible. However, this matter is of great importance and should not be taken lightly. Whether 300,000 yuan is sufficient is also in question. It was decided that the attendees would elect seven representatives to form a research committee to study and prepare for various preliminary issues of Pudong tap water, and to plan closely with Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, and engineers before convening another meeting for discussion. According to a Shen Shi News Agency reporter's investigation, the representatives elected at that time were Lin Kanghou, Yao Mulian, Pan Zhiwen, and other seven people.</p>
<p>The Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce Plan</p>
<h3>Maintaining Egg Sales</h3>
<p>Negotiating with France to Reduce Egg License Tax</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Has Consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Deliberation</p>
<p>Regarding the French government's amendment to the egg import license tax, the International Trade Bureau, after receiving instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, convened a meeting of Shanghai egg merchant leaders on the 29th of last month to discuss remedial measures. The New News Agency reporter visited Ji Zizejin, Director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, yesterday to inquire about everything. It is learned that the Bureau has summarized the meeting proposals and the opinions submitted by the Shanghai Egg Industry Association and the Jue Egg Industry Association and submitted them to the ministry for verification. The Bureau has now received instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Regarding this case, in addition to the International Trade Bureau's according to the opinions of the egg merchants, the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce are actively carrying it out. The original instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the original consultation from the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Regarding the French government's amendment to the egg import license tax, on the 13th of this month, we ordered your bureau to plan remedial measures and consulted the Ministry of Finance for joint review. Now, the Ministry of Finance's reply has been received by the ministry. A copy of the original consultation is hereby issued for reference. Please be informed of this order.</p>
<h3>Original Treasury Communication</h3>
<p>Approved is your department's communication No. 2197 regarding commerce, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' communication concerning the French government's revised levy on egg product licenses. Your communication requested consideration and a response. Upon reviewing the case, previously received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was noted that our nation's trade in chilled and wet eggs with France has been declining this year, likely due to French import restrictions and heavy taxation. This Ministry believes that maintaining sales of these products requires (1) reducing or exempting export taxes on chilled and mixed eggs, and (2) negotiating with the French government for reduced taxes on our chilled and wet eggs. The Sino-French Tariff Treaty includes reciprocal most-favored-nation clauses. Although, due to differences in the French tariff system at the time, a separate exchange of notes stated that France could not apply the lowest tariff rate to all of China, the current French tax on eggs imported from countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Poland is set at one franc and fifty centimes, while the import license tax levied on eggs shipped from our country to France reaches as much as four francs and sixty centimes. This disparity significantly hinders Sino-French commerce and, in principle, does not align with the spirit of most-favored-nation treatment. Regarding the reduction or exemption of export taxes on chilled and wet eggs, this Ministry has already instructed the National Tariff Commission to review the matter when revising export tariffs. As for requesting the French government to reduce taxes on Chinese chilled and wet eggs, this has been communicated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for consideration and action to sustain export trade, as per the previous communication. This response is for your department's reference.</p>
<p>Two Roads Office</p>
<h3>Leasing of Gas-Powered Vehicles</h3>
<p>Exclusively for accepting and delivering packages on behalf of customers</p>
<p>Monthly Rental: $300</p>
<p>The Two Roads Office, which accepts and delivers packages on behalf of customers, originally had a contract with Xie Xinggong and Jiang Jinji, the vehicle operators, stipulating a charge of ten cents per package, with a minimum fee of one dollar and fifty cents per batch. While this was convenient for merchants with numerous packages, travelers with only a few packages were deterred by the high minimum fee. To accommodate these travelers, the office negotiated with the China Gas Vehicle Company to lease a gas-powered vehicle for transporting packages. After approval from the bureau, the office and the company drafted a temporary agreement for vehicle leasing, which has been in effect since December of last year. The main points of the agreement are summarized below: (1) The office temporarily leases a one-and-a-half-ton gas-powered vehicle from the company, paying a monthly rental of $300. (2) All costs, including the driver, fuel, motor oil, vehicle tax, and repairs, are borne by the company. (3) The vehicle's working hours are from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM daily. If there is a backlog of packages, the hours may be extended to 10:00 PM. (4) If the vehicle is damaged and unusable, the office may hire another vehicle and deduct ten dollars from the monthly rental. (5) The company's gas-powered vehicle must be parked at a suitable location for immediate service and may not engage in other business activities outside of the office's delivery services. (6) The company's driver and other laborers must assist the office's personnel in loading and unloading packages. (7) This agreement is for a trial period of three months. If effective, a formal long-term contract will be established.</p>
<p>Wireless Radio</p>
<h3>"Peter Pan" Trademark Lawsuit</h3>
<p>One party accuses the other of trademark infringement</p>
<p>The other party claims the goods come from the same source</p>
<p>Chen Junsheng, the manager of the Tongtai Trading Company on Sijing Road, has recently retained attorney Lin Yingqing to file a lawsuit in the criminal court of the First Special District Court against Wang Gentang, the manager of the Meisheng Wireless Radio Company on Zhifu Road, and Li Wenxiang and Wu Xinghao, shareholders of the Lianhua Company on Beijing Road, for counterfeiting "Peter Pan" five-tube wireless radio trademarks and selling counterfeit goods. The lawsuit also includes a civil claim for an injunction and compensation of $9,000.</p>
<p>Defendants Li and Wu were summoned and appeared in court with their attorney, Wu Linkan. Plaintiff Chen Junsheng stated that the Tongtai Trading Company sells "Peter Pan" brand wireless radios, which are manufactured in the United States. The company registered the "Peter Pan" trademark with the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry in accordance with Article 1 of the Trademark Law in the 20th year of the Republic, receiving Registration Certificate No. 19763 on February 20th of the 22nd year of the Republic, granting exclusive rights for twenty years from December 15th of the 21st year of the Republic. Defendant Wang Gentang is counterfeiting "Peter Pan" wireless radios, selling them in the market, and advertising them widely, deceiving the public for profit. After a letter of warning was sent, Wang replied that the Lianhua Company, owned by defendants Li and Wu, had entrusted him with the sales. Therefore, the three defendants are jointly committing a crime, and since the counterfeit goods entered the market, the plaintiff's business has been greatly affected, with sales declining by several hundred units, resulting in a loss of approximately $9,000. Chen requested a judgment for compensation of losses, and presented the registration certificate and other evidence. Wang Gentang testified that Li and Wu had entrusted him to sell these wireless radios, a total of twenty-six units, priced at eighty-five dollars each, with Wang receiving a commission of five dollars per unit. Fifteen units have been sold. Li and Wu, through their attorney Wu Linkun, argued that on October 20th of last year, the Lianhua Company, through the introduction of American commercial consul Kerr of the American Consulate in Shanghai, was informed of "Peter Pan" radios, which were inexpensive and of good quality, selling for only twelve and a half US dollars. Lianhua sent a letter to the American Foreign Trade Society, ordering fifty wireless radio sets and sending a deposit, requesting immediate shipment to Shanghai. The "Peter Pan" radios are produced by the American Sackson factory and have been sold abroad for several years. After the Sackson factory closed down, all of its products were entrusted to the Foreign Trade Society for consignment sales. Lianhua Company received forty-six "Peter Pan" radios shipped from the United States by the Society. Twenty-six units were entrusted to the Meisheng Wireless Radio Company for consignment sales, and the remaining twenty units have also been sold. "Peter Pan" is not the plaintiff's trademark, as the "Peter Pan" mark was already marked on the radios when Lianhua ordered them from the United States, and the defendants did not counterfeit it. Moreover, these radios are from the same manufacturer as those sold by the plaintiff, with no difference, so there is no trademark counterfeiting. A letter was presented from Zhang Jinsheng, a comprador at the French barracks.</p>
<h3>Jumping into Xiaobang, Falsely Reporting Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Due to financial difficulties, this desperate measure was taken.</p>
<p>The truth was revealed after interrogation by the police.</p>
<p>Zhang Jinsheng, a native of this county residing at No. 72 La Fei De Road, La Fei Fang, French Concession, has been working as a comprador at the French military camp in Shanghai for three years. Due to financial difficulties, he was unable to pay the accounts of various businesses. On the eighth of this month, he took a chartered car to the Bund of Renji Road, instructed the driver to wait, and then went north to the North Railway Station, taking the 11:00 PM night train to Hangzhou. On the evening of the eleventh, he returned to Shanghai, but instead of going home, he stayed temporarily at a house in Hongqiao, west of Shanghai. The next morning, he secretly jumped into the Xiaobang River in Hongqiao. After waiting for a moment, he climbed back to the shore and reported to the First Police Station of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, falsely claiming that he was suddenly kidnapped by three bandits on the Bund of Renji Road on the eighth. One of the bandits had a pistol and bound him, and the $2,400 in cash in his pocket was also robbed and hidden. After about four days, the bandits brought him out and threw him into the river. After climbing out, he came to report. The police believed him and sent him home. The Lujiawan police station had previously received a report from Zhang's wife that her husband was missing. Since he had returned home, they sent an investigator to investigate. Zhang still lied about being kidnapped and claimed that he felt unwell due to excessive fear and needed to go to Guangci Hospital for medical treatment. Yesterday, the police heard that Zhang had been discharged from the hospital and, considering the seriousness of the case, went to investigate again. Zhang still insisted that he had been kidnapped. The investigators, noting that the incident occurred in the Public Concession, took Zhang to the General Police Station to report. After questioning by Chinese Inspector Li Yidong and Detective Zhang Xiaolin, many inconsistencies were found. Under strict questioning, Zhang finally revealed the truth. The investigators had him write a confession. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the circumstances and requested that he be punished for false reporting under Article 182 of the Criminal Law. Zhang Jinsheng confessed that due to recent financial difficulties, he was unable to pay his accounts and used the $2,400 given by the military camp for other purposes. To save face, he fabricated the kidnapping and robbery to request an extension of time for payment from the businesses, seeking leniency, and hired attorney Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Wu Xiangzu, after reviewing the confession, determined that Zhang's actions constituted occupational embezzlement, which was not under the jurisdiction of this summary court, and ordered the case transferred to the local court for trial.</p>
<p>Letters and various evidence, etc.</p>
<p>The judge ruled that the case still required investigation and ordered the three defendants to leave and wait for further review in seven days.</p>

<p>The Initial Enthusiasm Has Passed, A Sigh of Regret</p>
<p>Chinese-made soap traditionally uses tallow, pine tar, coconut oil, and other materials as manufacturing raw materials. These types of materials are produced in large quantities in various counties of Jiangsu Province. Because the soap made from them is widely used, the sales of raw materials are also very brisk. In recent years, Japanese merchants, recognizing that soap is a daily necessity, have invented a type of hydrogenated oil, also known as fish oil wax, which can be used as a substitute raw material for soap production. They import it into the Chinese market and dump it at low prices. However, the soap made from this material has very little effect. It not only cannot wash away greasy dirt, but it is also difficult to remove slight stains. Even though the selling price is low, only one or two small factories use it. Therefore, the position of domestically produced raw materials is not affected in the slightest. Recently, however, the boycott movement has effectively stalled, and Japanese merchants are taking the opportunity to transport various inferior goods to China as much as possible. Moreover, all goods are being sold at reduced prices. The price of hydrogenated oil is particularly low. Only small factories with weak capital occasionally purchased it in the past, but now the scope is larger. Soap factories with long-standing reputations are also eagerly purchasing it in bulk because they are greedy for its cheap price. They know that the soap produced will have reduced effectiveness, but they are all eager for immediate profits, and would rather abandon the excellent domestic raw materials and compete to use inferior goods. This is truly regrettable. It is hoped that there are still true advocates of domestic goods among the soap industry, and they should pay attention to this matter and not allow domestically produced soap to have only a false reputation.</p>
<p>The Victim Discovers a Fake Gun</p>
<h3>A Thief Caught on the Spot</h3>
<p>The victim saw through the deception and shouted to catch the thief.</p>
<p>Neighbors bravely assisted in capturing one of them.</p>
<p>At the home of Mao Jinhua, located at No. 13 Chunde Lane, Lanwei Road, French Concession, three bandits suddenly arrived around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. They knocked on the door and entered, holding a fake pistol (made of rotten bananas) to threaten the victim. When they were robbing the victim of the gold watch and gold chain he was wearing, the victim saw through the fake gun and shouted "Robbers!" Chen Chusheng, who lived with him, arrived to help apprehend one of the bandits, Ren Alin, while the others escaped. The victim's right hand was scratched by Ren and bled. The police arrived and took Ren to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Second Special Court. First, the police lawyer stated that the case still required investigation and requested a postponement. Judge Wang granted the postponement and ordered the defendant to be detained.</p>
<p>Among the Seven Criminals in the Sun Jiabao Kidnapping Case</p>
<h3>Only One Was Severely Sentenced</h3>
<p>Zheng Wenxiang Remains the Main Perpetrator in the Case</p>
<p>Zheng's Wife, Concubines, and Apprentices Were All Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Sun Wangshun's biological son, Jiabao, aged six, who resided at No. 115 Run'an Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, was kidnapped on May 20th of the previous year. Successive ransom letters were received, demanding a price of $8,000, later reduced to $4,000. Negotiations failed, and the case was discovered by detectives of the French police. Seven individuals related to the case were arrested: Zhang Shuchuan, and suspects Biao Yaoshan, Zheng Loushi, Zheng Zhoushi, Zhou Wenying, Li Ziqing, and Min Xinhao. They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Zhang Shuchuan, a native of Jiangbei, confessed that he worked as a sweeper in Run'an Lane. The plaintiff's son was actually kidnapped by Zheng Wenxiang, who is still at large. After the kidnapping, Zhang was responsible for looking at the ransom ticket and writing letters. Unfortunately, the child died of illness, and the body was abandoned on Zhongshan Road, where it cannot now be found. Qiu and the others testified that although they lived with the plaintiff, they did not participate in the kidnapping. After the defense concluded, yesterday's sentencing date arrived. Judge Li sentenced Zhang Shuchuan to sixteen years of imprisonment for jointly engaging in extortion, with the number of days of pretrial detention deducted from the term of imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The other six individuals, including Qiu, were found not guilty.</p>
<p>Dense Fog and Shallow Water</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Ships Blocked from Entering Port</h3>
<h3>Heavy Fog</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the mouth of the Yangtze River and the outer waters of Wusong were suddenly enveloped in heavy fog, making navigation difficult. As the river water is currently receding, navigation on the Yangtze River is more challenging. The heavy fog has made the passage of river vessels even more difficult. The Wuhu and Lianhe, regular Yangtze River ships of the British firm Taikoo Yihwa, were scheduled to arrive from Hankou yesterday. Due to the fog at the mouth of the Yangtze River, the shipowners, for safety reasons, did not dare to sail early and temporarily anchored on the river, so they did not come to Shanghai. They have notified the Shanghai office that they will sail to Shanghai after the fog clears. Several other Yangtze River ships have also been delayed by the fog and have not yet arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shallow Water</h3>
<p>The river water is receding and continuing to decline rapidly. The Jianghan Customs has issued a warning, notifying the six companies in Shanghai that Yangtze River ships loading goods and passengers in Shanghai for Hankou must not exceed a draft of eleven feet from yesterday onwards. Currently, the maximum draft in the Yangtze River is only twelve feet and one inch in the Jiujiang section, and only eleven feet in other areas. Exceeding this limit will make it impossible to navigate. All shipping companies have loaded cargo according to the limit. The Sanbei Company has dispatched the Sanbei shallow water vessel to Shanghai to facilitate the transportation of goods and passengers on the Shanghai-Hankou route during the shallow water season.</p>
<h3>Freight Rates</h3>
<p>During the shallow water season, Yangtze River vessels typically increase freight rates by twenty to thirty percent. With the current drop in river water, vessels cannot load as much cargo, resulting in significant losses. Yangtze River merchants have been calling various shipping bureaus for several days to inquire about whether shallow water fees will be increased. As Taikoo has not yet indicated its position on this matter, other Yangtze River vessels have not been able to increase prices independently. It is now reported that the shipping companies have inquired with Taikoo whether prices should be raised.</p>
<h3>Saving a Ship</h3>
<p>The Zhaoshang's Emei vessel, which was wrecked on the Huatanzi Reef in Fuzhou, was severely damaged again after being repaired. The total cost of repairs has reached 100,000 yuan. Recently, the bureau received a telegram from the shipowner, Ji Qingrong, stating that the upper reaches of the river have experienced a sharp decline in water levels, making the Emei vessel even more dangerous. The ship's hull is high and dry on the riverbank reefs and urgently needs to be repaired in a timely manner; otherwise, it will be beyond repair. The bureau has borrowed 20,000 yuan from the insurance company that insured the vessel to cover the cost of rescuing the Emei vessel and will remit the funds to Chongqing for rescue efforts upon arrival.</p>
<p>Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus Jointly Prohibit</p>
<h3>Funeral Processions Using Qing Dynasty Customs</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus received instructions from the Municipal Government yesterday to prohibit funeral processions from using Qing Dynasty customs. The original text reads: "Regarding the matter of jointly issuing a public notice, the Municipal Government has ordered that the China Nationalist Party Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee has sent a letter stating that the Sixth District Party Department submitted a report concerning funeral processions still using Qing Dynasty customs, requesting that they be banned, etc. Accordingly, the original submission is enclosed and sent. You are requested to investigate and handle the matter and respond. In accordance with this instruction, it is found that it has already been handled and recorded that funeral processions must not use Qing Dynasty customs. Following the previous instruction, the prohibition order should be reiterated. The original attachments are copied and distributed, ordering you to comply and report back this order, etc." In accordance with this, it is found that the prohibition of civilian wedding and funeral processions employing Qing Dynasty customs or feudalistic elements was the subject of the Temporary Rules for Prohibiting Wedding and Funeral Processions, jointly drafted in September of the eighteenth year of the Republic, submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgated. We should reiterate the prohibition order in accordance with previous instructions. In addition to the Public Security Bureau issuing a notice to its subordinates to pay attention to the prohibition, we are issuing a public notice for everyone to comply. Shanghai Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hong'en, Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Xingya, January of the 23rd year of the Republic.</p>
<h3>Establishment Meeting of the Beggar Relief Association</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a major trading port in our country, and vagrants and beggars are more numerous here than elsewhere. The aggressive ones demand money at the door, while the weak ones wail along the road. This not only tarnishes international views but also disrupts social order and affects the national livelihood and people's well-being. The Shanghai Beggar Relief Association, recognizing this, is planning to eliminate beggars in the city in the spirit of human mutual assistance and the principle of division of labor. It is reported that since the preparation of the association, everything has been ready, and the inaugural meeting will be held at the Local Association at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Increase of Municipal Tax on Two Teahouses</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter Requesting Investigation and Rectification</h3>
<p>Should be calculated based on one-fourth of the rent as a principle</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter yesterday to the Public Works Department and the First District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association regarding the municipal general tax on the Nanjing Road Yile Tian and Tong Yuchun teahouses. The following is a transcript:</p>
<p>To the Public Works Department:</p>
<p>We have received a letter from the First District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association, stating, "[Recently, our member stores, the Nanjing Road Yile Tian and Tong Yuchun teahouses, sent a joint letter stating, "We are writing to you regarding the Public Works Department's forced increase of the tax on our stores last winter. We are deeply grateful for the righteous assistance of your association and the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association. After repeated discussions with the tax office staff, we accepted the proposal in the interest of avoiding trouble. Yile Tian (No. 513 Nanjing Road) increased its annual tax by $1,400 on a rent of $4,000, and Tong Yuchun (No. 463 Nanjing Road) increased its annual tax by $1,000 on a rent of $4,400. It would be difficult for our business to bear any further tax increases, so we reluctantly agreed to the mediation and paid quarterly. However, it was agreed at the time that there would be no further increases. In a short time, the previous agreement was still fresh in our minds, but the Public Works Department insisted on achieving its assessment goals. On January 5th of the 23rd year of the Republic, before collecting the tax, the tax collector increased the estimated annual rent of Yile Tian to $7,500 by adding $2,100, and increased the tax bill of Tong Yuchun by another $840, totaling $6,240 annually. Under these circumstances, in terms of reason and logic, it is difficult for us to maintain our business in this era of agricultural and commercial bankruptcy and declining market. In terms of legal principle, the forced increase of rent and the exceeding of the due tax amount is difficult to bear. Therefore, we did not pay the increase at the time. On January 8th, the Public Works Department tax office summoned our manager and insisted on the increase. Our manager could not withstand the pressure and requested your association for assistance. We are grateful for your concern, etc.," and attached two rent receipts to the association. On January 7th of the 22nd year of the Republic, there was a forced tax increase, and our association sent a letter to your department to strongly protest the matter. Unfortunately, the manager of the teahouse was under environmental pressure at the time and was induced by the Public Works Department tax office to agree to an increase of $1,400 in the estimated rent for Yile Tian and an annual increase of $1,000 for Tong Yuchun without reporting to our association. According to the letter, the Public Works Department is becoming increasingly greedy and wants to increase the tax again, which is an insatiable desire. Moreover, the attached rent receipts show that Yile Tian's monthly rent is $335, totaling $4,020 annually, and Tong Yuchun's monthly rent is $340, totaling $4,080 annually. According to the one-fourth tax rule, Yile Tian should only pay $562.80 annually, and Tong Yuchun should only pay $571.20. The rent amount on the rent receipts is consistent with the company's accounts and is not fictitious. According to the manager of the company, the annual value of Yile Tian has been assessed at $4,000, and Tong Yuchun at $4,400 for the past six or seven years. After the forced increase last year, it is now being forcibly increased by more than half and more than one-fifth, which is enough to make the taxpayers feel disheartened. It has long been stipulated that the tax should be collected according to the proportion of rent. In recent years, the Public Works Department has forcibly increased the value of land and houses to increase its income, directly creating a few wealthy people and indirectly causing social concerns. Your association is actively trying to remedy the situation, and our association is also striving to promote rent reduction. However, the Public Works Department, which is responsible for maintaining law and order, only knows how to extract taxes through such high pressure, making citizens uneasy in their business. The association, as the representative organization of citizens and merchants, cannot remain silent. We hereby request your department to promptly advocate to the Public Works Department to exempt the two teahouses from the tax increase and reduce the tax in accordance with the standard calculation of the actual rent value to protect commerce and demonstrate fairness." We have reviewed the matter and found that the municipal general tax should be calculated based on one-fourth of the actual rent, which is an objective and concrete principle. Violating this principle and overestimating the amount is a tax increase, and its violation of the public opinion of the taxpayers cannot be concealed and should be corrected. In short, unless it can be legally proven that the rent of the teahouses is not real, the municipal general tax should be based on the rent amount stated on the rent receipts provided by the two teahouses; otherwise, it is legally unreasonable. We request your department to investigate and order the correction of this error.</p>
<p>To the First District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association:</p>
<p>We have received your letter of January 10th regarding the Public Works Department of the Public Concession increasing the estimated rent and increasing the municipal general tax on the Tong Yuchun and Yile Tian teahouses. The municipal general tax on rented houses should be calculated based on one-fourth of the actual rent, which is an objective and concrete principle. Violating this principle and overestimating the amount is a tax increase, and its violation of the public opinion of the taxpayers goes without saying. If the rents of the two teahouses are not falsely reported, then the previous recognition of the estimated rent was a waiver of due rights. Anyone who handles tax collection, regardless of who they are, always considers more revenue to be paramount, so they cannot act freely. Only the balance of the law can be relied upon. The two teahouses are unaware of this legal balance and only seek peace in the present, resulting in the fulfillment of an obligation that should not be fulfilled and bringing trouble upon themselves. In addition to sending a letter to the Public Works Department requesting investigation and correction, we are replying to your request for reference.</p>

<h3>Preparing for the Wuhan Mobile National Goods Exhibition</h3>
<p>Chen Yiting's Trip to Wuhan for Negotiations Was Successful</p>
<p>To promote the products of its member factories and intensify the national goods movement, the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, at the invitation of Wuhan Mayor Wu Guozhen, is co-organizing a mobile national goods exhibition in that city. The 14th First Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees resolved to send standing committee members Chen Yiting and Chen Jusheng as representatives to Wuhan to negotiate all matters.

<p>Unemployed Workers in the Silver Smelting Industry</p>
<h3>Request for Appropriation of 20,000 Yuan for Relief</h3>
<p>More Than Five Hundred Workers Gathered at the Guild Hall</p>
<p>Negotiations for Two Hours Yielded No Results</p>
<p>The Public Guild stated that since the Ministry of Finance officially announced the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan last year, the government authorities immediately ordered the silver furnace and public evaluation bureaus to cease operations, resulting in the unemployment of the original workers. Yesterday at 6:00 PM, more than 500 workers from the silver furnace industry gathered at the Silver Furnace Guild by the Tianhou Temple Bridge to negotiate the appropriation of funds for relief, arguing that the guild's assets, valued at hundreds of thousands [of yuan], were accumulated from the workers' wages and were now mortgaged to the bank by the employers. The situation was tense and almost escalated into a major incident. Upon receiving the information, the guild immediately reported to the patrol police station, which dispatched more than ten detectives to the scene to maintain order and prevent accidents. The workers nominated representatives Wei Laikun, Luo Maosi, Wu Youren, Yu Guizhang, and others to negotiate with Hua Jiating, the person in charge of the guild. The workers demanded 20,000 yuan for relief to cover living expenses, but the employers insisted on settling for 15,000 yuan. Until after 8:00 PM, the two sides had not reached an agreement and dispersed, agreeing to negotiate further at 2:00 PM today at the Tongyuchun Tea House on Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables a Request</p>
<h3>Reduce Telegram Fees for Encrypted Foreign Language Messages</h3>
<p>Change to Charging 60% of the Original Price</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, Nanjing: "To the esteemed Ministry of Communications, Nanjing, This case arises from a letter from the Shanghai Banking Association stating that a letter from our member, the Bank of China, reports that foreign language encrypted telegrams have traditionally been charged at two jiao per word, with each word consisting of ten code units. Since September of last year, when the International Telegraph Union formulated new telegraph rules in Madrid, Spain, the ten-code system has been abolished, and a five-code system has been adopted, with each word charged at 60% of the original price. The current Ministry of Communications has issued an order to all telegraph offices, mandating that all domestic foreign language encrypted telegrams should also be processed in the same manner from January 1st of this year. However, regarding the charging issue, each word is still charged at the full rate of two jiao, failing to comply with the international charter and reducing the charge by 60%. Given the current economic downturn, even following the international method would increase costs by 20% compared to the old system. Charging two jiao per word now effectively doubles the fee, which is not conducive to alleviating the difficulties of businesses. This matter concerns the entire business community, and it is proposed that your esteemed association discuss with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and request the Ministry of Communications to avoid discrimination against domestic foreign language encrypted telegrams and uniformly reduce charges according to the international new charter to avoid partiality and ensure fairness. Upon approval of this, our executive committee resolved to present this directly to the Ministry of Communications. As this matter concerns the entire business community, we request your esteemed association to take charge, and also present it to the Ministry to alleviate the difficulties of businesses and uniformly reduce charges to avoid partiality and ensure fairness, etc.' Upon receiving this, we have investigated and found that since the International Telegraph Union changed the standard for foreign language encrypted telegrams to five code units per word and charged each word at 60% of the original price, your ministry has uniformly adopted these standards, which is consistent with the international telegraphic community. However, the charging system still follows the old standard of two jiao per word, exceeding the international rate by 40%, and the handling is not fair. Therefore, we are telegraphing to report the situation and respectfully request your esteemed ministry to review and approve a reduction in charges to maintain business and avoid partiality. We are deeply grateful." Signed, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Fishing Protection Office</p>
<h3>Rules of Organization Promulgated by the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Appointment of Chiefs of General Affairs and Security Sections</p>
<p>After the Jiangzhe Maritime Fisheries Administration was ordered to be abolished, the Fishing Protection Office was established, appointing Yuan Lianghua, the former Director of the Administration, as the Director. Director Yuan has now received the organizational rules for the office promulgated by the Ministry of Industry, which divides the office into two sections: General Affairs and Security. Chen Weiqiao was immediately appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Section, and Chen Muxia as the Chief of the Security Section. Both section chiefs have already assumed their duties and will immediately begin to carry out fishing protection matters.</p>
<p>Revision by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<h3>Regulations on Penalties in Stamp Tax Ordinance</h3>
<p>Right to Appeal to the Court Within Five Days if Dissatisfied with the Ruling</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified various industry associations that on the 12th of this month, they received a public letter No. 184 from the Jiangsu Stamp and Tobacco Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, stating that "In accordance with Instruction No. 1822 of the Ministry of Finance, it has been found that according to Article 4 of the current Regulations on Penalties and Enforcement of the Provisional Stamp Tax Ordinance, judicial organs are not allowed to file objections to rulings on penalties under the Provisional Stamp Tax Ordinance. Therefore, even if a ruling is inappropriate, no appeal can be filed against it. Although, according to Interpretation No. 571 of the Judicial Yuan, it is possible to request the judicial organ to issue another ruling to revoke the original ruling, there is no further recourse if the judicial organ considers that it should not be revoked. Since the implementation of this policy, there have been obstacles, and there are many such cases in the Shanghai Special District Court, which must be remedied quickly. The ministry, in conjunction with the Ministry of Judicial Administration, has revised Article 4 of the regulations into two items: The first item states that an appeal against the ruling in Article 2 may be filed with the competent superior court within five days. The second item states that no further appeal may be filed against the ruling of the appellate court. Regarding stamp tax evasion cases, if the penalty is imposed by the Special District Court within the Special District, the penalized merchant should comply with the provisions of the revised Article 4 and file an appeal within the specified time limit if he believes that the original ruling is inappropriate. In addition to the Tax Affairs Office instructing the Shanghai Concession Cigarette Inspection Office to take note, the revised rules are copied and sent to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify merchants to take note." A copy of the attached rules was received, and accordingly, the revised rules are copied and sent to you for your information. Please also notify the merchants to take note. Included is a copy of the revised Regulations on Penalties and Enforcement of the Provisional Stamp Tax Ordinance by Judicial Organs. Upon receiving this, it was found that the public associations, such as the rental car industry, have repeatedly sent letters stating that there is no appeal mechanism for stamp tax penalties in the Special District, and merchants are suffering. We have previously requested relief based on the regulations. Now, with the aforementioned approval, the original rules are printed and circulated for your information. Please check and forward them to your subordinates for their information. This is essential. End of statement."</p>
<p>Tenants of Xiaoyou Lane, Xujiahui</p>
<h3>Object to Rent Increase by Catholic Church</h3>
<p>The houses in Xiaoyou Lane, Xujiahui Town, Shanghai West, are the property of the Catholic Church. When the houses were built, each tenant contributed to the construction costs, ranging from four to five hundred yuan, with the Tongyixiang Foreign Goods Store at the intersection of Bei Dang Road and Hague Road contributing the most at 1,200 yuan. This was handled by the late Mr. Zhu, and both parties agreed that the rent would never be increased. However, a few days ago, each tenant suddenly received a notice from the Catholic Church's rental accounting office stating that the rent would be increased by four to five yuan starting from February 1st of this year. Upon learning of this, the tenants rose up in opposition, stating that "At a time when all industries are declining and it is difficult to maintain a livelihood, and rents are being reduced everywhere, Xuhui is the only exception. Moreover, the Catholic Church is a charitable organization and should especially consider the difficulties of the people and reduce the burden appropriately. Now, the opposite is happening, and all of our tenants will rise up in opposition." Therefore, a few days ago, the Xiaoyou Lane Tenants Association of Xujiahui was organized, and representatives were elected to petition the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Gentry of Qibao Urge Dredging</p>
<h3>Sixth Section of the Puhuitang River Project</h3>
<p>Since the Puhuitang River in Shanghai West was dredged with funds allocated by the National Government Songhu War Zone Relief Committee, the river sections in Songjiang and Qingpu counties have been completed long ago. However, the sixth section under the jurisdiction of Shanghai City has been delayed due to the depletion of funds. Gu Junjie, Li Qixian, Shen Caigeng, Li Youxian, and other gentry of Qibao, Songjiang County, believe that the sixth section is the head of Jiajia [River] and that failure to dredge this section would ruin all previous efforts and must be opened as soon as possible. Therefore, at 5:00 PM on January 17th, they hosted a banquet at Yijia Chun on Sima Road, inviting Zhang Shougong, former Deputy Minister of Finance, Hu Yunzhuang, Standing Committee Member of the Relief Committee, Secretaries Wu Yingzhong and Jin Jiashi, and dozens of gentry from Shanghai West, including Gu Rungui and Yang Fuyuan. During the banquet, the method of promoting the dredging of the sixth section was discussed. Deputy Minister Zhang reported that the dredging of the sixth section was indeed necessary, and he would request the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds, which should be possible. He also urged Shen Yi, Director of the Public Works Bureau, to plan the commencement of work as soon as possible to satisfy public expectations. Li Youxian and others expressed their gratitude, and the gathering ended happily.</p>

<p>Six Abducted Men and Women Uncovered in Dinghai</p>
<h3>Public Notice Issued by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to Claim</h3>
<p>Song Shaoying, Chief Prosecutor of the Dinghai County Procuratorate in Zhejiang Province, approved the Dinghai County Public Security Bureau on January 2nd of this year to transfer the case of Yan Zhang and others for obstructing family life. After investigation, the procuratorate found that there were six abducted men and women, mostly abducted from Shanghai. Therefore, in addition to sending separate letters to the local courts to summon family members and issuing a public notice to claim them, Song sent the previous situation and photos of the six children to Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, yesterday, requesting him to issue a public notice to claim them. It is reported that Director Wen reviewed the letter and, for the sake of reuniting the children with their families, immediately instructed Yin Guanzhi, Director of the Relief Section of the Second Division of the bureau, to handle the matter. The names, ages, and origins of the six men and women abducted in Shanghai are as follows: (1) Jin Aliang, male, eight years old, from Hangzhou, living in Houcao, father's name is Yi Ji, selling zongzi at Hangzhou Railway Station.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Establishes a South Shanghai Office</h3>
<p>Site Determined at the Original Site of the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Health Bureau moved to the new urban area, it is concerned that the densely populated South Shanghai area may be difficult to reach with health facilities. Therefore, it plans to establish a South Shanghai Office in the South Shanghai area. The original site of the Municipal Party Headquarters has been determined as the office location, and preparations are underway. It is expected to officially start operations in early March. In the future, the South Shanghai Clinic will also be moved there.</p>
<p>Chung Hwa Book Company</p>
<h3>Reprint of Sibu Beiyao</h3>
<p>The Sibu Beiyao previously published by the Chung Hwa Book Company on Jing'an Temple Road has carefully selected books, excellent printing, and the antique and moving imitation Song Dynasty movable type, which can be compared with the fine prints of the Ming and Qing dynasties imitating the Song Dynasty. It is especially praised by readers. Both pre-sale reservations were fully subscribed and closed. Recently, there have been many more requests, and some have even sought to purchase at higher prices but have not been able to obtain them. The company should have reprinted it immediately, but it is quite laborious due to the large number of volumes. Therefore, for the sake of circulating ancient books, it has decided to reprint them. A special kind of Lian Shi paper has been ordered from the Jiangnan and Baoshan paper mills. The size has been changed to five Kai large format, and the space between the lines has been widened. The book is of a large format and is sold in groups for pre-order to satisfy the wishes of book collectors at home and abroad.</p>
<h3>Yongtai Silk Factory Recruits Silkworm Farmers</h3>
<p>The Yongtai Silk Factory in Wuxi was founded by Mr. Xue Shouhuan. Mr. Xue has traveled in Europe for many years and has a wealth of knowledge and experience in sericulture. Recently, he was deeply saddened by the disastrous defeat of China's silk industry, which was almost unable to stand in the European and American markets. To reverse the decline, thorough reforms are necessary. Therefore, in recent years, he has hired domestic sericulture experts to preside over the factory affairs and has added a sericulture training class to train professionals. He has also sent experts to England, America, France, Italy, Japan, and other countries to investigate the sales and production of silk. This spring, he plans to set up silkworm farming cooperatives in the areas with the most mulberry production to guide farmers in silkworm farming knowledge in order to improve the products. Therefore, the need for talent is extremely urgent. Those with considerable experience in silkworm farming guidance, regardless of gender, must be recruited. Those who are interested in this can go to the factory on January 25 to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Jin Yidan's Invention of Thermal Bottles</h3>
<p>China's thermal bottle industry has been very developed in recent years, but unfortunately, it still adheres to the old methods and uses silver powder for manufacturing, resulting in weak reflectivity and failure to compete with imported products. Although some have switched to using colored glass liners, the products are far from satisfactory. Recently, it has been heard that Mr. Lin Zeren, director of the Tianjie Chemical Laboratory at No. 54 Nanjing Road, has taken this into account and has carefully researched and invented the manufacture of gold-colored bottle liners, which are much better than the silver liners currently used by factories. Its heat preservation ability is more durable than silver liners, and because of its stronger reflectivity, the amount of liquid stored in the bottle can be seen clearly. The heat preservation ability of those using gold liners can be increased to 36 hours. Therefore, this invention is indeed a major revolution in the thermal bottle industry. Mr. Lin has already applied to the Ministry of Industry for a patent, and it is also heard that several factories are currently negotiating. It is expected that these high-quality thermal bottles will be launched soon.</p>
<p>Continental American Company</p>
<h3>To Establish a Branch in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Contribution of the Latest Model of Grain Storage Machine</p>
<p>The Continental American Company is a company specializing in the foreign wheat business. The company has huge capital and perfect equipment. There are branches in various European countries. Because it is aware that the sales of foreign wheat in our country are extensive, it has specially sent Mr. Leon Hakim to China to investigate and appointed him as the General Manager of Shanghai. He is currently residing in Room 701 of the Metropole Hotel at the intersection of Sima Road and Jiangxi Road as a temporary office. A formal office will be established soon. According to Mr. Hakim, the general office will build a new-style wheat storage machine in Washington and Vancouver. The function of the machine is to change the old-style packaging storage method to bulk storage and can be permanently preserved. The cost is approximately US$1 million. The capacity of this machine can store 2 million bushels of wheat, making it the world's largest storage facility. This project has now hired 300 to 350 workers to start construction. At the earliest, it can be completed by July. If the progress is slow, it can also be extended by three or four months. The greatness of the project can be imagined.</p>
<p>Zhabei Chuan Highway</p>
<h3>Cracked Down on the General Headquarters of Huahui</h3>
<p>Huahui gambling is extremely harmful. Although the Municipal Police Department has been closely investigated, it has not been successful. The day before yesterday, the Supervision Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a secret report that a Huahui headquarters was located in the Tiger Stove at the corner of Chuan Highway in the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct of the Fifth District of Zhabei. However, the places where gambling equipment and gambling funds are stored are very secret and difficult to find. Therefore, a map was attached. The bureau then sent a supervisor to rush to the scene and found the headquarters after searching according to the map. A large amount of gambling funds and equipment were confiscated on the spot, and one gambler was arrested and brought back for interrogation. It is heard that the gambling ringleaders who opened the Huahui headquarters are Shen Jiafu, Qian Zhongfan, Cai Erkan, Mi Xiaoliang, Wang Liansheng, etc. These people are famous Huahui kings, and their activities in the Second and Third Precincts of the Fifth District of Zhabei are abnormal. Director Wen is conducting a strict investigation to bring all the above criminals to justice.</p>
<h3>Re-trial and Verdict on the Human-Dog Intercourse Case</h3>
<p>Chen Xinzhai and Others Sentenced to More Than Nine Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>Chen Xinzhai, a Henan man who used to ring the bell at the Yong'an Company amusement park, and his mistress, Chen Lu, were arrested and sent to the First Special Court for trial and sentencing after raising a black dog and four young girls at No. 12 Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road, and performing human-dog intercourse at major hotels. Chen and Lu were sentenced to ten years and two months of imprisonment each. Chen and others were dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch Court, which upheld the original verdict. They then appealed to the Supreme Court in Nanjing, but because part of the case was not yet clear, it was sent back for re-trial. The Second Branch Court of the High Court concluded the re-trial last Wednesday. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police department, appeared in court and requested that the original verdict be upheld and the appeal be dismissed. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the date for the verdict of this case arrived. The police department proposed Chen Xinzhai and Chen Lu from the prison. Zhao Zhengtao presented it with the two judges, Xie Jiang and Zhou, to the court and announced the verdict. Chen Xinzhai was sentenced to nine years and ten months of imprisonment and fined 310 yuan. Chen Lu was sentenced to nine years and eight months of imprisonment and fined 320 yuan as a warning.</p>

It is heard that the factory is working day and night to increase production and has added sample rooms at the Nanjing Road Family Industrial Society and the Jiangxi Road China Pottery Company to fulfill its original intention of promoting domestic goods and resisting foreign imports. The stove has a beautiful appearance, resembling ancient bronze vessels, and can serve as a high-quality decorative item for interiors. Its embossed patterns further enhance heat transfer, allowing for even distribution of heat, surpassing any other stove.

<p>Reading Questions and Answers</p>
<h3>Reading Plan (I)</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance...</p>
<p>After receiving your department's registration certificate, I truly felt indescribable joy. I only waited for the sky to darken quickly, to quickly pass ten o'clock, so that my work could be released. I can freely review the mistakes I made during my solitary self-study journey in the past, I want to honestly confess, and I also want to follow the procedures of your department's research, draft a plan, and make the first communication.</p>
<p>Alas! Things are really unlucky, tonight it happens to be my turn to pack copper coins, after ten o'clock, I am still packing one envelope after another. This work continued until twelve o'clock, which really killed me, the store's rules are that after one o'clock all staff must go to bed, otherwise they will not be able to get out of bed tomorrow, and will be punished.</p>
<p>Sir! I am now continuing to write. The time is twenty-four hours apart, it is the second night's ten forty-five, tonight I can finish this communication.</p>
<p>Sir! Do you think the above small talk can be taken away! No! Absolutely not! This is my actual life, the actual life of an apprentice. You must know this first, in order to understand my requirements, in order to give me the food that I can possibly swallow, in order for me to receive your department's teachings; at the same time, your work will not be in vain!</p>
<p>I am so busy. Ten hours of regular life every day, not including the chores that are not part of the regular work, are determined by the managers and supervisors, it is an [unwritten] code, you cannot predetermine it. However, I pay attention to all aspects of life... I save wasted time with agility, flexibility, and organization, and fill in non-[work-related services,] so I still have two or three hours of extra free time every day to use for reading. I am always tense, so even when reading I want to use the least amount of time and energy to get the greatest effect.</p>
<p>I believe this effort is possible, but I have not yet obtained what method should be taken for this effort?</p>
<p>My previous self-study was mostly biased towards Chinese, so I have made some progress in writing. Last year, I saw many people talking about social science in newspapers and magazines, and I also wanted to find some to read, and later I borrowed some from former classmates. But I immediately encountered two difficulties, the first was that I couldn't understand it, and the second was that the books were too thick, making it inconvenient to read a few pages in one night. Because it is not like a novel, you can put it down today and continue reading tomorrow night, the plot is not easy to pick up, this kind of book is already difficult to understand, once you put it down, the next day you have to read it from the beginning. Otherwise, you can't read it down. I used extraordinary patience, but the result was still limited. So, I asked my friend to borrow thinner, more popular books, he laughed and said... [There aren't any in China]. In the end, I still had to read with a stiff neck, read, although I did manage to finish them one by one, but the price I paid was too high. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Inspector Zhong Daozan of the Ministry of Education Discusses</h3>
<p>Inspecting Education in Nanjing</p>
<p>Inspector and Section Chief Zhong Daozan of the Ministry of Education is currently compiling his report on his recent inspection of education in Nanjing. I had the opportunity to speak with him, and he shared his impressions, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Elementary Education: There are a total of 39 municipal elementary schools in Nanjing, with 15,926 students and a budget of 445,512 yuan. There are a total of 30 municipal compulsory elementary schools, with 5,442 students and a budget of 75,084 yuan. There are a total of 30 registered private elementary schools, with 4,365 students and a budget of 98,400 yuan. There are 16 unregistered private elementary schools, with 1,958 students and a budget of 33,768 yuan. There are 6 public elementary schools run by various institutions, with more than 1,600 students. There are 16 municipal kindergartens, with 888 students, and 5 private kindergartens, with 240 students. In addition, there are 50 to 60 private elementary schools of a church nature whose names are unknown, and the number of students and expenses are unknown. There are also a total of 574 private schools, with 14,995 students. The total expenses of municipal elementary schools, compulsory schools, and private schools amount to 700,000 yuan. Including public elementary schools and private schools of a church nature, the total is nearly 800,000 yuan. Adding the income of private schools, averaging 300 yuan per school, there should be a total of 170,000 yuan. Therefore, the total amount of elementary education expenses in Nanjing exceeds 1 million yuan. Observing this, I feel that the amount of education in Nanjing has increased by 10% compared to before 1932. At the same time, the population has also increased by 10% (Nanjing currently has a population of 730,000). If we calculate based on the general standard that there should be one school-age child for every ten people, then there should be 73,000 students among the 730,000 people. However, this standard is not applicable to Nanjing, because Nanjing is a place where people from all over gather, and many civil servants, military police, and others do not have families and school-age children. Actually, there should be less than 65,000 students. There are currently 48,000 students in school. Although there are still 17,000 out-of-school children, elementary education is more popular than in other prosperous cities.</p>
<p>▲ Secondary Education: There is one municipal secondary school, with 465 students and a budget of 59,892 yuan. There are three public secondary schools (provincial Nanjing Middle School, Nanjing Women's Middle School, and National Central University Experimental School), with 1,560 students and a budget of over 200,000 yuan. There are 14 registered private secondary schools, with 5,846 students and a budget of 549,900 yuan. There are 8 unregistered secondary schools (and several schools for orphans and the ambitious that have not been thoroughly investigated), with 954 students and a budget of 94,752 yuan. The total expenses of public and private schools are approximately 1 million yuan. Most of the secondary schools in the city are ordinary, and the schools run by the government are more numerous than private schools, and the expenses they occupy are more generous than private schools.</p>
<p>▲ Social Education: There are 28 public schools for citizens in Nanjing, with 1,971 students and a budget of 1,705 yuan. There are 14 social education organizations, 24 supplementary schools (including 4 vocational schools), and 48 cultural organizations.</p>
<p>▲ Education Expenses: In 1933, the city's education expenses totaled 683,582 yuan. The allocation for elementary education accounted for slightly less than 77%, for secondary education, slightly less than 11% (vocational education accounted for 24% of secondary education expenses, and middle schools accounted for 76%), and for social education, 76%. The planned budget for the next year (i.e., the 23rd year after the summer) is set at 948,494 yuan. It is planned to allocate slightly more than 74% for elementary education, 13% for secondary education, and 10.13% for social education. Vocational education accounts for 51.5% of secondary education expenses (planning to establish one senior industrial school and two vocational supplementary schools, and one junior vocational school), and middle schools account for 48.5% of secondary education expenses, including three classes for normal schools. This is the result of the consultation between the ministry inspector and the city officials. The city officials plan to proceed according to the budget plan. Whether it can be fully achieved after the summer depends on future facts. Regarding the independence of the city's education expenses, the city government recently designated the Ministry of Finance to provide funds and a portion of the house tax as special funds for education (if there is a shortage, temporary special funds will be designated to supplement). They are deposited into the municipal bank every month and are not used for other purposes. At the same time, a committee for the safekeeping of education funds is jointly organized by the Secretary-General of the City Government, the directors of the Social and Financial Bureaus, and two representatives of middle and elementary school teachers to perform their duties and seek to guarantee the funds.</p>
<p>▲ Education Administration: The authorities of various schools in Nanjing mostly fail to implement the regulations for middle and elementary schools and normal vocational schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education. In particular, regarding the number of students per class, the collection of fees, the number of teaching hours for teachers, the integration of teaching and training, youth guidance, manual labor education, coeducation, administrative organization, and other issues, there are many places that cannot be consistent with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education. Although it is said that there are occasional special difficulties that cannot be fully complied with, it is also an unavoidable fact that they are governed by past habits and do not reform. It is hoped that this can be improved.</p>
<p>▲ Teaching Equipment: A few schools, such as Zhongying, Anhui, and the National Central University Experimental School (the two provincial middle schools were inspected by Councilor Chen, and Zhong did not mention them), all have considerable equipment for science, while the equipment for manual labor education is simple and inadequate, except for the Municipal No. 1 Middle School and the National Central University Experimental School. A few schools even have this subject but no equipment, which is far from the central government's hope for the goal of manual labor education.</p>
<p>▲ Teaching Methods: Teaching methods for various subjects, such as Chinese, English, social studies, and science, mostly adopt lecture and injection methods, failing to use materials and opportunities to allow students to study and work on their own.</p>
<p>▲ Training and Guidance: In terms of training and student guidance, many private secondary schools are affected by financial difficulties and often recruit more students, with 70 or 80 students in each class. By the time they graduate in the third year, the school teachers and staff can hardly do more than recognize the students' names and faces, let alone understand each student's personality, and there are even fewer facilities for academic and career guidance. At the same time, the education administration authorities have failed to actively proceed in accordance with the methods promulgated by the Ministry of Education for academic and career guidance for middle and elementary school students.</p>
<p>▲ Compulsory Education: Municipal compulsory elementary schools are to help out-of-school children and to do a lot with a small amount of money. Generally speaking, the academic performance of students is still passable. However, there are some points that need to be paid attention to: (1) The school buildings and equipment are too simple and crude. (2) The selection of teachers and teaching are not as good as those of ordinary elementary schools. (3) The curriculum focuses on language and mathematics, and the third and fourth grades still adopt a full-day system, which is the same as ordinary elementary schools. Therefore, students have no special difficulties in entering ordinary senior elementary schools. However, they lack a lot in terms of the entire educational life. Most of the senior elementary schools they can enter are not excellent schools above the horizontal line. Therefore, it cannot be considered as evidence of considerable achievement simply because their level can occasionally connect with that of ordinary elementary schools. Therefore, in order to make the academic performance of the compulsory elementary schools excellent, it is necessary to utilize excellent equipment to achieve considerable results. It is definitely not possible for schools with simple and inadequate facilities to express the entire spirit of elementary education. Therefore, the compulsory elementary schools in Nanjing should pay special attention to equipment and teaching in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Corporal Punishment Phenomenon: Many elementary schools practice corporal punishment. Corporal punishment is a kind of educational method in the past that is unnatural and full of inertia, and it is strictly prohibited by law. It must not be allowed to exist. It is hoped that the local education authorities will investigate and prohibit it to avoid the spread of bad habits and affect the development of elementary education.</p>
<p>Chairman He Jian of Hunan</p>
<h3>Severe Punishment for a Student Movement</h3>
<p>Trial of Military Training for Normal School Students</p>
<p>Order for the Expulsion of the Entire Class</p>
<p>(Changsha Correspondence) Hunan has established a National Military Training Committee, with He Jian serving as its chairman, overseeing military training in provincial secondary and higher-level schools. Students who fail military training will not be allowed to graduate, aiming to rigorously implement military-national education to cope with foreign aggression and seek self-strengthening, with the best of intentions. Each school has appointed a military training director and military training instructors. Over the past year, while considerable achievements have been made, disputes have also arisen repeatedly. For example, students from Hunan University and the Qunzhi Law School mostly refuse to accept military training, claiming that they do not want to be warlords and therefore do not need military training. The biggest reason is that those serving as military training directors and instructors, apart from military matters, lack sufficient knowledge to inspire the students' faith and are often despised by the students, so they are unwilling to be trained by them. Students from the Provincial First Middle School also disapprove of military training for the same reasons. Recently, the National Military Training Committee, because the military training of the ninth class of normal school students was about to conclude, specially sent Committee Member Kuang Shushu to the school to conduct the military training graduation examination. Student number twenty was caught cheating, and when Kuang stopped him, he refused to comply. The whole class suddenly erupted in an uproar, tearing up their papers and refusing to take the exam, shouting and yelling loudly. Kuang fled in a panic and reported to the National Military Training Committee, which convened a temporary emergency meeting to decide on a solution: (1) Expel all students of the ninth class of the school; (2) For the ringleaders, expel them, and for the rest of the class, record demerits and allow them to remain in school under observation for a year; (3) Record demerits for the entire class and allow them to remain in school under observation. After the above resolutions were made, they were reported to He Jian for approval. He Jian, in order to rigorously implement military training and rectify academic standards, adopted the first option, ordering the expulsion of the entire class to serve as a warning. At the same time, Wu Huihua, the principal of the First Middle School, immediately convened a meeting to give a lecture after the students boycotted the examination, explaining the greater significance. The students were all able to repent and, with all students signing and stamping, submitted a letter of repentance, requesting leniency and promising to absolutely accept military training examinations in the future. Zhu Jingnong, the Director of the Education Department, then took the students' letter of repentance to meet with He Jian, explaining the students' subsequent repentance and requesting that the second and third options proposed by the National Military Training Committee be adopted to show compassion. This was because the students in the class had been studying at the school for five years since starting junior high school, and they would be graduating in June of this year. Expelling the entire class would be a regrettable outcome. Unfortunately, He Jian's mind was already made up, and there was no way to reverse the decision. Director Zhu had no choice but to implement the plan, ordering on the 13th that all forty-odd young people in the class be expelled. (January 13th)</p>
<h3>Henan Province Middle School Entrance Exam Begins</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The third annual graduation examination for middle school students in the province, divided into thirteen districts across the province, began on the 16th. The Jinan district examination venue is located at the Provincial First Normal School. There are 294 examinees, and He Siyuan, Director of the Education Department, is serving concurrently as the chief examiner. The supervising committee members are Lee Chin-ho, a prosecutor representing the High Court, and Yang Wen-fu, a section chief representing the Municipal Government. There are eleven examination rooms in the venue, with the seating arrangements already determined and properly arranged. Starting at 7:30 AM, thirteen of the examinees did not arrive, with 281 students present (including 14 girls from middle school). Their names were called, and they were given exam papers and entered the venue in order. In the Jinan district, only mathematics is being re-examined for senior high school students, and there is no re-examination for junior high school students. The graduation examination is entirely for junior high school students. Although nearly 300 people took the exam today, the order was well maintained. All staff members wore red ribbons and were under strict surveillance. From 8:00 AM to 12:15 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, the exam was completed. It will continue on the following day.</p>

<h3>Hainan Biological Collection Group</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in Two Batches, Passed Through Shanghai to the South</p>
<p>▲ Organized by Seven Groups, with a Total of Twelve Members</p>
<p>▲ The Land and Sea Teams Plan to Collect for One Year</p>
<p>The Hainan Biological Collection Group, jointly organized by seven groups including the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, departed from Shanghai to the south in two batches the day before yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Founding Organizations: The Hainan Biological Collection Group was originally initiated and organized by six groups, including the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, the Natural History Museum of the Academia Sinica, the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute of Beiping, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Shandong University. Later, the Guangzhou Geological Survey Institute was introduced by the Beiping Geological Survey Institute to participate, so the group is jointly organized by seven groups.</p>
<p>List of Members: The group has twelve members, and the list is as follows: (1) He Qi from the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute (Entomology), Tang Shankang (Taxidermist), Xing Huayan and Feng Lian'ge (Technicians); (2) Liu Cheng from Shandong University (Anthropology), Zuo Jinglie (Botany), and Li Yugui (School Worker); (3) Wang Yikang from the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China (Ichthyology), Liu Zhibie and Zhang Zongjun (Technicians); (4) Tang Jufeng from the Natural History Museum of the Academia Sinica (Marine Animals) and Deng Xiangkun (Lower Plants). Zuo Jinglie is the team leader, and Wang Yikang is the deputy team leader.</p>
<p>Departure in Two Batches: The group of twelve members came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and stayed at the Huizhong Hotel. The first batch, including Tang Shankang, Xing Huayan, Feng Lian'ge, Li Yugui, Liu Zhibie, Zhang Zongjun, and Deng Xiangkun, took a steamer south the night before yesterday. Zuo Jinglie, He Qi, Liu Xian, Wang Yikang, and Tang Shifeng departed on the Japanese Empress of the Changxing Company to Hong Kong last night.</p>
<p>Collection Plan: According to team leader Zuo Jinglie's interview with reporters yesterday, there have been several organizations of Chinese biological collection groups, but they have all departed to collect in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangxi. The only one collecting in Hainan is Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, but they are limited to higher plants, and this group is the first to consider all parts. In addition to investigating higher plants, lower plants, and animals, this departure will also focus on anthropology. There are many Miao and Li people in Hainan, which is very important for human relations. The collection will be divided into land and sea teams. The sea team will specialize in collecting marine organisms, and the land team will be divided into mountain and land groups to specialize in collecting animals, plants, and anthropology.</p>
<p>One-Year Deadline: Zuo also said that the planned deadline for this departure is one year. They are carrying more than 30 pieces of equipment, medicines, and camping gear, and will go to Guangzhou to wait for a boat to Hainan. The cost is 8,000 yuan, which is shared by the four groups. The first step after returning with the collected materials is to distribute the collected materials to various institutions for research, and the second step is to combine the research results and then distribute them to various institutions for teaching materials and other references.</p>

<p>City Education Bureau Sends Personnel</p>
<h3>To Safeguard Important Jinan University Documents</h3>
<p>(Shanghai News) The turmoil at National Jinan University surrounding the expulsion of Zheng has not yet been resolved. The City Education Bureau yesterday sent personnel to the school to work with the Expel Zheng Association to safeguard important documents. The Shanghai Alumni Association also sent representatives to petition Mayor Wu and Director Pan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Education Bureau Sends Personnel to Safeguard Documents: The City Education Bureau, upon instruction from the Ministry of Education, sent staff member Yang Zhi to the school yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to consult with the Expel Zheng Association on safeguarding important documents in various offices. Xiong Pengnan, a representative of the association, received him. As a result of the consultations, the important documents of the Registrar's Office were sealed.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives Petitioning in Beijing Telegraph Success: The Expel Zheng Association received a telegram from the representatives of the school petitioning in Beijing, stating that the process in Beijing is going smoothly and that all parties are expressing great sympathy. The issue of removing Zheng will be resolved at the Fourth Plenary Session.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Alumni Association Calls on Mayor Wu: The Shanghai Alumni Association sent representatives Qiu Hanping, Qiu Zhizhong, Xie Huaiqing, Lan Wenhai, and Li Jialin to call on Mayor Wu yesterday morning to report on the establishment of the association and the truth of the turmoil, and to request that he forward a letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters to prevent the activities of the previously dismissed committee members. The mayor personally received them and promised to go to Beijing within a few days to discuss the issue of the principal with the school board members. The representatives then went to the City Education Bureau to call on Director Pan, requesting that the details of the expulsion of Zheng at Jinan University be forwarded to the Ministry of Education. Director Pan agreed to handle the matter. The representatives then returned to the association.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Edict</p>
<h3>Petitioners from Jinan University to Return to School Immediately</h3>
<p>丨Settle Down to Study and Await Resolution丨</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th) Chen He and seven others from Jinan University, in the name of the Protect the School Committee to Expel Zheng, went to the Ministry of Education to petition on the 17th at noon. The Ministry of Education believed that the name used by the students was clearly inappropriate, and the minister sent personnel to personally instruct the students to return to school immediately, settle down to study, and await resolution.</p>
<p>Private Schools in the Concession</p>
<h3>Request the Municipal Council to Increase Subsidies</h3>
<p>▲ The Chinese Ratepayers' Association will forward the request to the Education Committee for discussion</p>
<p>There are many private schools in the Shanghai concessions. The Education Committee of the Municipal Council has allocated funds for periodic subsidies to show maintenance and guidance. Many private schools in the concessions have received this subsidy, but there are still some schools that have not received subsidies, and there are other schools whose subsidies are too small to maintain their operations. Therefore, they have requested the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement to forward their request to the Municipal Council for assistance. The Chinese Association has sent a letter to Mr. Lin Kanghou, a member of the Education Committee of the Municipal Council. Mr. Lin raised this issue for discussion when he attended the Education Committee yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. According to news from the Municipal Council, this matter is still under consideration.</p>
<p>Initiated by Lin Sen and Others</p>
<h3>Founding the Huanghuagang Middle School</h3>
<p>The Huanghuagang Middle School, initiated by Lin Sen, Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, Zhang Ji, Chen Lifu, Niu Yongjian, Yan Deji, and others, is now ready. On the one hand, it is proceeding with the formalities of applying for establishment to the Education Bureau, and on the other hand, it is starting to enroll students. It has also rented Shen's Garden on Zhiyuan Road in Zhabei as the school building. The buildings are spacious, with pavilions, terraces, flowers, and trees. The sports field is also very large. It is currently being repaired and will be completed within a week. Before January 15th, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau on Daji Road in the South City will temporarily serve as the registration location.</p>
<h3>New Look for the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School</h3>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School in this city has been established for thirteen years. Hundreds of students have graduated and are serving the cause of women's physical education in various provinces of China and the Nanyang Islands. In recent years, the school has been striving to advance its operations and improve the campus environment. In the winter of the 20th year of the Republic, it rented its newly built buildings on Daji Road to the Aiqun Girls' Middle School and opened a new campus base of dozens of acres in Jiangwan. Unexpectedly, after just moving in, it was hit by the January 28th Incident, and all facilities were destroyed, with losses amounting to tens of thousands. However, the school's principal, Ms. Lu Lihua, did not let this dampen her spirits. With the spirit of accepting adversity, she struggled independently, 13 years as one day. Last autumn, the Jiangwan site was rebuilt for the second time, investing heavily in various sports fields, gyms, and all facilities to make them perfect. It is said that a large track and field and a dormitory that can accommodate more than 200 students will be built during this winter vacation. It is expected to be completed by the start of the school year. It is also planned to start building a gymnasium and swimming pool in the spring of this year, which is expected to be completed within two years to create a large-scale women's physical education school.</p>
<h3>Renhe Midwifery School Holds Graduation Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Renhe Midwifery School, which has been established for many years, held its 23rd graduation ceremony yesterday. Huang Renzhi gave a speech, and representatives from the Education Bureau gave certificates. Representatives from the Health Bureau, Zhao Chan, gave a speech. The graduate representative, Xu Xiangyun, gave a speech. There were more than a dozen graduates of midwifery and one nurse. After the ceremony, there was an academic performance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School Graduates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School, a private school on Jiaozhou Road, has been established for many years and has achieved outstanding results. Since the Ministry of Education stopped running normal schools concurrently with middle schools, the number of students at the school has increased sharply. More than 400 graduates have served in Suzhou, Shanghai, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Fujian, Hubei, Henan, and other places. The 11th graduation ceremony was held yesterday, with 35 graduates. The list is as follows: Wang Peizhen, Zhu Baozhuang, He Xiuhong, Wu Shiying, Wu Fujuan, Lin Yaxing, Hu Le, Hu Yazhen, Yu Pinshu, Yu Mei, Xuan Wenmei, Yao Yinjuan, Yao Jingxian, Xu Xiuzhen, Chen Peiying, Chen Dehua, Sun Juecui, Xia Meijun, Xu Huizhen, Zhuang Lanying, Zhang Heng, Zhang Zhongying, Zhang Zhiming, Huang Chenglan, Dong Meifeng, Rong Zhifen, Zhao Yuying, Zheng Jinxiu, Qian Xiaoshu, Dai Ruixian, Qu Shun'e, Qu Lianting, Yan Wanying, Gong Zhaolin, Gong Shenglai.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Vocational School Building New School Buildings</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Senior Vocational School in this city is building a large school building on 16 acres of land on the South Railway Station Branch Road, which has been briefly reported in the previous newspaper. It is now heard that the second phase of the school's construction began yesterday. First, a new-style gatehouse, reception room, and consumer cooperative business office will be built inside the gate. Next, a dining hall, bathhouse, and washroom that can accommodate more than 400 people will be built. Finally, an auditorium, library, and gymnasium will be built. The school is currently recruiting spring transfer students, and the first examination is scheduled for the 21st of this month. Many people have signed up enthusiastically.</p>
<h3>McLellan Middle School Building Gymnasium</h3>
<p>▲ People's School Holds Graduation Ceremony</p>
<p>McLellan Middle School on Nifeng Road in Shanghai has been improving its school operations in recent years, hiring specialized talents who have graduated from universities at home and abroad, adding various experimental books and sports equipment, implementing a combination of teaching and training, and adding various elective subjects. In the graduation examination last year, all students passed. This semester, the school's equipment has been greatly expanded. Hygiene toilets were recently built and will be completed in early March. The cornerstone laying ceremony for the two-story gymnasium is also scheduled for May 6. This semester is scheduled to end on the 21st of this month, and the next semester will begin on February 1. New student entrance examinations for the school's attached tutoring school and people's school are scheduled for February 2 and 3. In addition, the school's attached people's school is scheduled to hold its third graduation ceremony in the school's auditorium at 7 pm this evening. The program includes speeches and movies. The school's attached tutoring school will also hold a closing ceremony and teacher-student social gathering at the same time.</p>
<h3>Fuller School for the Deaf Adds School Buildings</h3>
<p>The Fuller School for the Deaf on Jessfield Road, Kangding Bridge in this city, was founded by Dr. Brown, an American missionary, and has achieved outstanding results. Most of the teachers it hires are experts from Yantai who have studied for many years and have broad and rich academic knowledge and experience. In particular, it uses phonetic symbols, Roman letters, and Bailey letters as pronunciation symbols to teach deaf students, which is its only characteristic. Because the number of applicants has been increasing, the original school buildings, classrooms, and dormitories are not enough. Two new buildings have been added in a lane a few steps away. The old and new buildings together are large enough to accommodate more than 100 people, and many new teachers have been hired.</p>
<h3>Guangxia Elementary School Department Advancing Rapidly</h3>
<p>Guangxia Middle School at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Xinzha Road has magnificent facilities, complete management, and has long been registered with the Municipal Education Bureau. The school's elementary school department has always been presided over by Zhou Leshan, an expert in elementary school education. Under Zhou's leadership, the school has been advancing unusually rapidly. The number of people signing up in recent days has been very enthusiastic. When necessary, a dual-track system may have to be implemented.</p>
<p>Sports</p>
<h3>Recent Status of Each Group in the Western Union Football League</h3>
<p>The Western Union Football League's joint matches for each group this season are more than halfway through. Although there have been many unexpected changes and so-called upsets, the situation in Group A seems to be largely determined. Unless there is an unpredictable accident, it seems extremely difficult for last year's champion, Tung Wah, to retain the title. Jinan also has little hope. It is also difficult to take the top spot away from the French Business School. However, Tung Wah and the Chinese Customs Service still have to meet the French Business School once, and the two teams may have a chance to take revenge.</p>

<h3>American Women Win over Southeast A</h3>
<p>Southeast A is getting worse and worse, failing and without momentum. The forwards throw and pass randomly, falling into a state of confusion.

<h3>Two Rivers Overcomes the Red Team</h3>
<p>As the game between the Two Rivers and Red teams began, the atmosphere instantly became tense. Although Two Rivers consistently took the lead, the Red team showed no weakness, staying closely behind, with the score difference never exceeding five or six points. In terms of opportunities, the Red team had more than Two Rivers, but unfortunately, they couldn't score, or Two Rivers would have been in trouble. Chen Rongming's performance was diminished, and the defense was lax. Last night, Yang Sen also accumulated two personal fouls. Therefore, the victory was truly precarious. In the first half, Two Rivers scored six consecutive points, but the Red team gradually closed the gap, with the first quarter ending 8-5, a difference of only three points. At halftime, the score was 15-11, only four points apart. In the second half, Two Rivers scored six points in a row, plus another four, making it 21-11. From then on, the Red team fell behind. Although they made a desperate effort in the last quarter, they couldn't catch up with Two Rivers, and the Red team succumbed at 34-24.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Wishing for a Sign of a Lean Year</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Snow is a sign of a bountiful year, so every year there is snow, and every year the autumn harvest is abundant. Who knew that despite the annual bumper harvests, farmers still clamor about being poor every year? What is the reason for this? We only hear farmers talking about "ripe wasteland." Ripe and wasteland are relative terms; how can they be linked together to form a noun? We don't understand economics; there are those who do who can expound grand theories. I wonder when their grand theories will have an impact on farmers? When will farmers' actual lives be able to improve a bit?</p>
<p>A few days ago, this damn snow came down again, blanketing the sky. Naturally, from a scientific standpoint, it's also a harbinger of good fortune, freezing all the pests to death, guaranteeing another year of good harvest. I'm afraid next year will still have the word "wasteland" attached to "ripe," spat out from the frustrated tone of the haggard farmers.</p>
<p>Yuan Sheng, in his "Old Study Cong Tan" of the Zizhai Studio, said that Jia Sidao, because there was no snow in the twelfth month, and the wheat couldn't grow, lit candles and burned incense at the fifth watch, silently praying to the heavens. That day, before noon, clouds rose and there was light rain, and at dusk it snowed, and it fell heavily at night, accumulating several inches at the second watch. At the third watch, an imperial plaque was issued, praising the timely snow and the answered prayers. That semi-retired prime minister was so patriotic and loved the people, and the heavens actually responded. Mr. Sheng's words are a bit too saccharine; he doesn't know that even if the auspicious snow came in time, the Yuan soldiers still penetrated deep into the country.</p>
<p>In this era of revolution and science, naturally no one is willing to talk about auspicious omens anymore. Who knew that those local newspapers in the inland areas, which bear the responsibility of guiding public opinion, would actually write about "auspicious snow"? We not only felt nauseous, but also a bit heartbroken. If the Japanese saw heavy snow in the three northeastern provinces, it would be fitting for them to call it auspicious snow. As for foreshadowing a bountiful year, I'm afraid it's not what 70% of Chinese farmers hope for. Because they would rather have a bad harvest and higher rice prices, which would be more beneficial to them. I heard a farmer say this myself. What kind of psychology is this?</p>
<p>This year's snow fell quickly, accumulated quickly, and melted quickly. From beginning to end, it lasted less than twelve hours. One moment, it seemed like jade buildings and silver palaces, and the next, it was back to the same old shack and leaky roof. This can be taken as a symbol of the Fujian Incident.</p>
<h3>Year-End Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>A certain day's business in a large bookstore on the Fourth Road amounted to only one dollar and two cents.</p>
<p>Waking up early in the morning, I heard that someone had hanged himself under a small tree at the corner of Baochang Road. Driven by curiosity, I went to watch. The body was still hanging from the tree, looking like a small businessman in his forties, wearing a used overcoat bought on the stone road, his hat fallen on the ground, his face pale, his mouth and eyes half-open. A large crowd gathered to watch, irresponsibly speculating, "He must have committed suicide because he couldn't bear the cold weather, the approaching end of the year, the suffering from hunger and cold, and the creditors' demands. Alas! What a pity!"</p>
<p>When you walk past the area near North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road at around 9 PM, someone will forcibly pull you in to taste Western-style meat; you will also faintly hear shouts of "Three Dollars Only! Only three dollars is enough!"</p>
<p>In a shoe store on North Henan Road that is preparing to close, two comedic partners are standing at the entrance. Although they are slapping shoe soles in their hands and shouting about big discounts, very few people enter to buy cheap goods!</p>
<p>A seller of glutinous rice rolls told me that in previous years he could sell twenty or thirty thousand cash every morning, but now only three or four thousand, with a profit of two cents, not even enough for a day's expenses.</p>
<p>A certain cinema only had three viewers for one night show.</p>
<p>A barber is also sighing, "Maybe this year is colder than in previous years! Why are people afraid to come for a haircut?"</p>
<p>Even famous paintings and calligraphy are no longer valuable in this situation. There are fewer people appreciating them than in previous years, and collectors are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns!</p>
<p>Big discounts, winter discounts, genuine, extraordinary, special, honest, sacrifices, painful sales, clearance sales, shop closures, all kinds of big discounts, bright flags waving, ear-splitting military music playing, all of this, all of it, expresses nothing but the sorrow of the year's end.</p>

<h3>Talking About Heavenly Bamboo</h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Heavenly bamboo sprigs inserted in vases are, along with wintersweet and daffodils, exquisite products of the cold season. Also known as Southern Heavenly Candle, or abbreviated as Heavenly Bamboo, it is an evergreen shrub commonly found in the Wu and Chu regions. The tree grows three to five feet tall, occasionally reaching ten feet, but it is not easy to see. Furthermore, the taller ones do not bear fruit. The leaves resemble those of the chinaberry but are smaller, and they do not wither in winter. Small white flowers with five petals bloom in March and April, and the berries grow in clusters, gradually turning red like cinnabar in winter, which is very lovely when set against the snow. There are many variations, with flowers that are crimson in color and berries that are either yellow or white. It prefers shade and dislikes dampness, making it ideal for planting in courtyards or against walls. Mound it with yellow mud, and it will naturally thrive. Do not water it with manure; if you must water it, use cold tea or water infused with pheasant or magpie feathers. Respectfully prune its trunk in autumn, leaving only the solitary root, and side branches will grow, making it short and suitable for bonsai, a refined offering for a scholar's studio. Heavenly bamboo is like a beautiful woman of old, charming and lovely, and also like a refined scholar, elegant and free from vulgarity. Unfortunately, I live in cramped quarters with no space to plant it, and I am constantly moving. Otherwise, I would plant lush branches and leaves, with one or two jagged rocks nearby. Looking at them would make me forget the world and dispel worries. There would be no need to retire from the world, and I would naturally find the pleasure of seclusion in the mountains and forests. At the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, around Huajinli and Ermalu in Shanghai, sellers of daffodils, wintersweet, and heavenly bamboo gather to form a market. However, many people are deceitful, inserting already fallen berries into the branches. They may seem pleasingly red, but when purchased and brought home, the berries soon wither and turn black. Careful examination is essential to avoid being fooled.</p>
<p>Although Zhang Zixiang is famous for painting peonies, his other bamboo, rocks, orchids, and chrysanthemums are also exceptional and refined, highly regarded by people. One day, he was making a screen, depicting the four seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. When he reached the last panel, he suddenly had a dispute with his wife over a trivial matter. His wife, in anger, threw his painting tools on the ground to vent her anger. The fat from the lamp splashed and spilled onto the painting, with countless dots. Zixiang quickly took up his brush and turned it into a cluster of heavenly bamboo, with a special artistic touch, far superior to his usual work. From then on, there was a steady stream of requests for him to paint heavenly bamboo as a background element, greatly improving his livelihood.</p>
<h3>A Certain Blind Man (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Hui Jian</p>
<p>The blind man's forehead was filled with bulging blue veins from anger. He walked up to Mr. Liu Si in fury and said in a cold voice, "Everyone is like this; everyone loves to inquire, and yet no one is willing to believe. Why would Xu Lao Jiu deceive me? He is my best friend. He has been hoping for someone to cure my blindness for over a decade. Five years ago, he told me the name of Ma Keli Sha. He spoke with such sincerity! Pour some yellow liquid from a silver medicine bottle and dab it on my eyelids, that's all, he said. I won't forget a single word he said. Why would he deceive me? Let me tell you, Ma Keli Sha really exists..."</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Si originally wanted to say, "Because Xu Lao Jiu is your good friend, that's why he deceived you," but he clearly knew that saying those words would shatter the blind man's heart. He immediately said with a gentle laugh, "You are truly brave, but I think Ma Keli Sha may already be very old now."</p>
<p>The blind man said calmly, "Yes, if he is alive, he would be seventy-two years old this year, but I still want to find him. I have been looking for him for five years."</p>
<p>He accompanied the blind man across a river that was the furthest from his village. Across the river was the territory of another village. He watched as the blind man's faltering figure gradually faded and disappeared into that distant, unreachable horizon, and he imagined him stopping every passerby, asking in his strange, gloomy voice that would annoy anyone who heard it, "Please tell me, is Mr. Ma Keli Sha still alive?"</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Si would never forgive Xu Lao Jiu for this extraordinary sin.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>

<p>Chapter 23</p>
<p>Unbearable Pain Heedfully Listens to Music Joyful Sentiment Not Yet Sated Prompt Separation with Urgent Message</p>
<p>As Ji Zhi saw him, he also had a bit of humility, so he poured a cup of tea, lowered his head, and slowly sipped it. While he was sipping the tea, Zhao Weng said a few words intentionally or unintentionally, but Ji Zhi didn't hear them, only lowering his head to drink the tea. Zhao Weng watched him with cold eyes and said nothing, putting his hands behind his back, walking back and forth in the open space, looking up slightly, only watching the red leaves on the mountain. They remained like this for about half an hour, neither of them speaking. Zhao Weng walked back to his seat and smiled at Ji Zhi, "Second Master, let's return after enjoying ourselves, we don't need to go up the mountain anymore, we can find two animals and slowly go back." Ji Zhi stood up and smiled, "We have been sitting here for too long, it's probably too late to go up the mountain, it's good to go back together." So he took out money to pay for the tea, and the two walked to the foot of the mountain, hired two donkeys, and walked back along the road. After walking about four or five miles, two or three cars chased them from behind. The ground on this road had been crushed by large carts and was originally a very thick layer of loose soil. Now, as the cars sped past on the loose soil, plumes of dust flew up, obscuring people's eyes and ears. Ji Zhi saw that there was an officer in the car, with two young women on either side of him. He turned his head to one side, coughed for a while, and walked a hundred steps before the flying dust settled. He laughed on the donkey's back, "Old Master, did you see that? The people in the car are the same ones who were hugging women and having fun in the Xishan Inn upstairs just now. Do you believe that these people can save the country and the people?" Zhao Weng sighed, "Alas! There's no way to deal with this." Ji Zhi smiled, "Let me tell a joke, please don't be angry. When Zhao Company Commander becomes a division commander or army commander in the future, you must tell him not to learn from these officers." Zhao Weng said, "You're right. When people have no money or power, you can't see any bad qualities, but once they have money and power, all kinds of bad habits come out. But my boy, as far as I know, is still honest, but I can't say for sure in the future. But even if there are army commanders and division commanders, it won't be his turn." (294)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>Talking About Snow</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ji</p>
<p>After a few warm days and one night of north wind, snow, like flying catkins and spreading cotton, flew all over the sky. A silver light covered all the heights and roughness of the world; the houses were adorned with jade and wrapped in silver, the mountains and forests were piled with jade powder, everything in the human world became bright and pure. Standing on a high building and looking out, it was truly jade palaces and silver towers, a single color for ten thousand miles! The superficial embellishment of the world is called "whitewashing peace," but human power is ultimately not as great as nature! Only snow can whitewash everything, can create a flat scene between heaven and earth!</p>
<p>Stories about snow, like Sun Kang reading by the light of snow, Wang Ziyou visiting Dai An in the snowy night, and Meng Haoran looking for plum blossoms in the snow, are all famous and recorded in history. Sun Kang, this kind of bookworm, is said to be a headache for school authorities nowadays. Wang Ziyou's unique temperament is also impractical now. Only the elegant and profound taste of the old master Meng is the most popular, and it is enough to be modern. Please see that in the near future, in front of the tomb of the recluse Lin Bu, in the Dengwei Fragrant Snow Sea, a continuous stream of important people and celebrities, Fujian talents and men of letters will come to look for plum blossoms and walk in the snow, to adorn this beautiful country.</p>
<p>Due to the eastward flow of European winds, as Christmas approaches, ordinary new-style stores also decorate a seasonal snow scene in the glass windows, to show their understanding of the times. A group of modern girls, to show their Westernization, will also enthusiastically express themselves in the park's north wind by building snowmen and chasing snowballs, things that they wouldn't have glanced at before. Unfortunately, this grand event has not yet spread to the inland areas. The snowmen piled up in the streets and alleys of Suzhou are still the original art of the children, and they are not very ingenious. However, the snow lion in front of a certain Buddhist store last year was majestic and imposing; unfortunately, this kind of artwork was only appreciated by a few children, and as soon as the sun came out, it quickly melted away with the flowing water, leaving no trace.</p>
<p>Santa Claus is a kind, red-robed, white-bearded old man. He often secretly gives people the things they need in the snow, especially children, who are the only recipients of his gifts. On Christmas morning, when children wake up from their sweet dreams, the things they have been waiting for all year are already hanging high in their socks. Therefore, European and American children regard Santa Claus as their only beloved benefactor. Although this is a myth used by Europeans and Americans to coax children, Christmas is always a happy day for foreigners, just like the lunar New Year in our country. But now that our country's society and economy are gradually collapsing, people's attitude towards the New Year is like Wang Xiaoer's New Year, very difficult. If there really is a Santa Claus in the world, I really wish he would visit China once, like Bernard Shaw, and send some gifts to the people. Unfortunately, the economies of Europe and America are mostly preoccupied with their own affairs. My ideal is only like looking at this powder-like white snow, unable to really turn into powder to relieve human hunger.</p>
<p>Snow is a hexagonal crystal, so Chinese people call snow "Teng Liugong." The Elementary Learning says that snow flies in six petals, a harbinger of a bountiful year. According to ancient tradition, winter snow can kill common pests that harm plants. It is said that the more snow falls, the more those hibernating pests cannot resist the cold and are completely frozen to death. When plants sprout in the coming spring, the pests are already dead, and the plants thrive and grow without any insects eating them. Naturally, the five grains will be abundant, and the year will be very prosperous. Therefore, snow can predict the abundance or leanness of the coming year, but the effect of spring snow is the opposite of that of winter snow, so although they are both white snow, their effects are completely different.</p>
<p>When I was young, I saw a story about snow that was profound in meaning and gave the wealthy people who did not know poverty a deep cut. The story said that in a certain year in the state of Qi, there was heavy snow, and Duke Huan of Qi was living in the deep palace with a blazing fire, not feeling the cold at all. He was surprised and asked Yan Pingzhong, "This is really strange, it has been snowing for three days in a row, but I don't feel cold at all, what is the reason for this?" Yan Pingzhong replied well, "Your Majesty lives in the warm palace, drinking lamb wine, naturally you don't feel cold, but how many ordinary people outside have already frozen to death?" People living in waterfront houses, please think about this story when appreciating the snow.</p>

<h3>Japanese Goods in the Women's National Products Year</h3>
<p>— Yang Bian</p>
<p>What are the results of the Women's National Products Year? We haven't seen them yet, but the startling newspapers are full of headlines saying, "[Amidst the promotion of national products, the import of inferior goods has greatly increased, reaching over 50,000 tons in just two weeks, with four times more being directly shipped to North China]."</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese government, seeing the decline of the Chinese anti-Japanese goods movement, has organized a trade control agency for China, with the Japan-China Trade Co., Ltd. as the main body, directly under the guidance of the Director of the Commercial Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its commercial officials. Its organizational content: (1) Establish a head office in Osaka, Japan. (2) Jointly handle export trade to China by various companies engaged in trade with China and commercial organizations in China. (3) Open branches in Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Fuzhou, Shanghai, and Hong Kong to manage trade within their respective regions. (4) The Director of the Commercial Bureau will appoint a general manager and closely liaise with commercial officials stationed in China to cooperate in controlling the export of goods and developing new markets. (5) Transportation agencies will also be unified and directly managed by the company. (6) Increase the number of commercial officials stationed in inland China to investigate the inland market and find ways to develop it. Such a vicious tactic is attacking us right at the beginning of the Women's National Products Year. How can we resist it with our immature national products industry? We should know that this is not just a matter of life and death for the national products industry; it is a matter of life and death for our entire nation. We have nothing else now but to consistently use national products to save the country and save ourselves. Everyone should recognize that using national products is the starting point of national morality and the foundation of national revival. The women's community has an unshirkable responsibility, and the men are even more obligated. Not only should men and women be united and cooperate fully, but the government and the people must also be sincere and earnest in supporting each other. Tao Jun Leqin once told a reporter, "[To control the economy, one must first start by controlling import and export trade. If import and export trade cannot be controlled, no matter what kind of control you promote, it will be useless]." This statement is very insightful. I believe that the government today, seeing the rapid advance of Japan's control of trade with China, must not engage in empty talk, act hypocritically, or shy away from economic resistance against Japan, thereby leading itself to ruin. Mr. Gu Tinglin said, "[The rise and fall of the world are the responsibility of every man and woman]." Citizens! Citizens! At this critical juncture of life and death, let us no longer stand by, no longer shirk responsibility, no longer be indifferent, and no longer be forgetful. Please see if we can save ourselves this year?</p>
<h3>Admit to Half the Blame</h3>
<p>— Shen Airong</p>
<p>This year is the [Women's National Products Year]. Gentlemen, take a step back for now and let us women handle it. The play has just begun. Can the leading ladies maintain their consistency and dedication to perform well and achieve a satisfactory result, earning applause from the audience? This, of course, depends on the efforts of the women!</p>
<p>In the past, people ||mostly gentlemen|| always blamed women for not being patriotic and for being happy to promote enemy goods, as if the underdevelopment of Chinese industry was entirely due to women's sabotage. Recently, there was a report of a 900 million yuan trade deficit, with women's goods accounting for the majority, giving the gentlemen a big handle to constantly nag about the women's shortcomings.</p>
<p>I don't deny that women love to be pretty, with rosy faces and colorful clothes, but to insist that women are not patriotic, at least I, as one of the women, am not willing to silently accept this.</p>
<p>Speaking within the small scope of my school, this year the female students' leather coats are all made to order or purchased at the Penglai Market, which shows that the women have some awareness. However, I dare not guarantee whether the wool used to make these coats is domestic.</p>
<p>Rural women who come to Shanghai to buy clothing materials always like to go to Xiaodongmen because it is both cheap and good-looking, but the source of these beautiful and inexpensive fabrics is heartbreaking; most of them are enemy goods. However, the women are not at fault! These fabric stores are all opened by our esteemed compatriots. Some customers, fearing being deceived, ask if the goods are domestic. The answer is not only that they are domestic but also that there is a trademark from a certain factory as evidence, so you can't help but believe it. Women with weak discernment, especially those from the countryside who come to Shanghai, how can they know the secrets within? ||Even the gentlemen probably wouldn't know!||</p>
<p>The gentlemen are the most fond of nitpicking. When they see women dressed attractively, they insist that they are not patriotic. Is wearing a coarse cloth shirt the only way to be called patriotic? Then wearing Lao Jiuhe's domestic silks and satins, wearing leather coats bought at the Penglai Market are all unpatriotic, all regarded as enemy goods? Isn't that a bit too much?</p>
<p>In short, everyone should admit to half the blame. The women must truly live up to the name and not disappoint the [Women's National Products Year]. The gentlemen in the business community should also put their conscience in the right place and not let the sight of silver turn their patriotic red heart black.</p>
<h3>Hoping for a Few Women</h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>Along with the opening of the [Women's National Products Year], the tide of [Women Promoting National Products] has spread throughout our society and country. At present, it has become the most important and practical work for our national women's community, like the sun and moon in the sky and rivers on the earth. For the future of revitalizing national products and blocking foreign goods, there will certainly be significant achievements. However, in my humble opinion, there are a few women in our community who, due to special reasons, can guide the public and influence society. Therefore, we must hope that they will be the pioneers, so that the whole country will follow suit, and its effectiveness will naturally be greater. Now, I will list a few that I can think of:</p>
<p>1.  Movie stars. Movies have the greatest influence on society, and the actions of movie stars have an even greater impact on the public. Starting this year, if our national movie stars can take the lead in promoting and using national products, and if domestic films can all have performances promoting national products, like the background of [Spring Silkworms] [Perfume Beauty], using the economic invasion of imperialism and women's fondness for foreign goods, which leads to the outflow of money and the decline of domestic products, with the most painful and intense ending, to touch the heartstrings of our national women and promote the determination to love and use national products, the gains will be self-evident.</p>
<p>2.  University and middle school students. In recent years, students in universities and middle schools across the country have often liked to wear foreign goods, especially female students, who wear fancy clothes and strange attire. Looking at their clothing, there is no trace of national products. This trend is truly heartbreaking. Starting this year, they must fundamentally awaken and use national products, and teachers must stipulate that all school documents and books, whether uniforms or casual clothes, must use national products; otherwise, once discovered, they will be ordered to drop out of school. Teachers and students should unite and engage in the movement to promote national products.</p>
<p>3.  Leaders of women's communities. One call from a leader will be followed by thousands. Whether they are in the political, banking, education, or any other professional field, as well as famous and virtuous women, this year, of course, we must hope that they will take responsibility, use national products, and take the lead in promotion, so that the whole country will follow suit.</p>
<p>The responsibility of promoting national products belongs to everyone. This year is the [Women's National Products Year], and we women must naturally work harder. The people I listed above have a responsibility and cannot shirk it. Of course, they must work hard, be courageous, and strive to move forward on a road full of vitality.</p>
<h3>National Products and Modern Women</h3>
<p>— Li Qiu</p>
<p>From last year's [National Products Year] to this year's [Women's National Products Year], the cry to promote national products has finally reached the clouds. Although what we see objectively is still a large amount of [trade deficit] and the sluggish production and sales of national products, we cannot deny the great efforts we have made subjectively, which have already established a considerable foundation in the call to promote national products.</p>
<p>This year is the Women's National Products Year. This illustrates that the responsibility of promoting national products is not only borne by men but also must be borne by women as the center of this task. Therefore, every Chinese woman standing on the stage of the Women's National Products Year should make the greatest determination to actually strive to promote national products, so that the meaning of this Women's National Products Year will be richer and more substantial.</p>
<p>Currently, modern women generally wear famous brands from Paris and London, apply foreign cosmetics worth dozens of yuan a box on their faces, and worry that everything they use daily, from shoes and hats to even a small handbag, is not a foreign product, as if it is not modern if it is not a foreign product, and not fashionable if it is not an imported product. The amount of money they spend seems to be irrelevant to them, and they are even more unaware of the loss to national interests!</p>
<p>This year's Women's National Products Year, first of all, we must draw the attention of these modern women. We must make the greatest effort to correct this incorrect trend. We must point out that the modernity and fashion expressed by foreign goods are not true modernity and true fashion. This expression shows one's own ignorance, and in the call to promote national products, it is a shameful behavior!</p>
<p>True modernity and fashion are the love of national products expressed from that pure and high intellect. Although national products are not as good as foreign products in some aspects, if a woman uses national products and wears national products, then the modernity and fashion in her wearing and decoration are enough to show her love for the country and the nation, and to show that she is a modern woman with knowledge and reason. In the call to promote national products, the meaning of modernity should be reinterpreted from the ground up.</p>
<p>No matter if you are wearing the most fashionable clothes of 1934 or using the most expensive popular Parisian cosmetics, because they are not national products, they are not modern!</p>
<p>Only women who use national products are truly modern women!</p>
<p>Mr. Song said to his wife with a smile, "This year is the [Women's National Products Year]. You are wearing all national products, and you can be called a pioneer of modern women."</p>
<h3>An Iron Lesson</h3>
<p>— Ms. Zhihua</p>
<p>One evening, several guests were sitting in Mr. Li's house, one was Wu Liang, the manager of the Xiezong Department Store, and the other was Wen Lianfu, a university professor.</p>
<p>The conversation began in a very natural way.</p>
<p>"Hey, Brother Wu Liang... I heard that Old Wang's wife is now the chairman of the Women's National Products Movement Committee. Is that true?"</p>
<p>"Of course! But these women are just using this to show off! What can she do?" Wu Liang replied.</p>
<p>"I even saw her giving a speech at the General Chamber of Commerce the day before yesterday!"</p>
<p>"Giggle! Giggle!" A burst of laughter ended this short conversation.</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>"The Women's National Products Year has begun, and there is a citywide car parade! The streets and alleys are full of enthusiastic women promoting national products. Mrs. Wang is the general director of the car parade. The wives of Wen Lianfu and Wu Liang are also crowded in the enthusiastic crowd promoting national products.</p>
<p>Passionate speeches. Snowflakes of flyers.</p>
<p>"Resist foreign goods!" "Promote national products!" In the heart of every woman, a passionate national and state view was ignited. The pain of January 28th throbbed in their minds! ×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>The next day, the following news was published in the newspaper.</p>
<p>"The Xiezong Department Store in this city has been an agent for the dumping of Japanese goods. It usually buys Japanese goods at low prices and sells them under the trademarks of domestic factories. It was recently discovered by the Seventh Investigation Team of the Women's National Products Movement Committee, which immediately sent personnel to search and found many kinds of original Japanese goods in the warehouse. The committee members, with conclusive evidence, unanimously resolved to confiscate the company in the near future and use it as a national salvation fund, etc."</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>A few days later, there was another announcement in the newspaper...</p>
<p>"Lawyer Shi Mingli, representing Ms. Zhang Yongzhen, issued a statement announcing her divorce from Wu Liang, the manager of Xiezong Company... According to our client, Ms. Zhang Yongzhen, she and Mr. Wu Liang became husband and wife seven years ago through a friend's introduction, hoping to work together to achieve the purpose of serving society and promoting industry. Unexpectedly, Mr. Wu Liang has become insane in the past two years, greedy for small profits, impersonating domestic factory trademarks, and indiscriminately selling Japanese goods. Recently, he has even intensified his efforts and used tricks to sabotage the national products movement. Ms. Zhang Yongzhen, based on her patriotic enthusiasm, has repeatedly advised him, but he insists on going his own way and does not care. Recently, due to incompatible ideas and deteriorating feelings, Ms. Zhang Yongzhen, for the sake of her personality, is unwilling to live with this person who recognizes a thief as a father. In addition to reporting Wu Liang's bad deeds of indiscriminately selling Japanese goods to the Women's National Products Movement Committee, she also announced the severance of her marriage relationship with Wu Liang, etc...."</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>This is the Women's National Products Year. The wave of women promoting national products will inevitably give those who underestimate "women" an iron lesson.</p>
<h3>Let the Women Handle It</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Last year [National Products Year], throughout the entire year, we were truly tired of shouting all the slogans for promoting national products, but what were the results? What was revealed to us was a trade deficit of 900 million yuan, setting a new record never seen before. Seeing the Eastern and Western foreign devils laughing heartily, reflected that our national products industry was shouting itself hoarse, with no one responding. If we think carefully about this responsibility, of course, our national women's community cannot escape it. Therefore, starting this year, it is designated as the Women's National Products Year [Let the Women Handle It], with our national female compatriots jointly taking responsibility to promote and use national products. Naturally, this great driving force will be much more practical than last year's empty words and high-sounding theories. However, judging from the current situation, we should absolutely observe both aspects at the same time, which is the difference between urban women and rural women in their attitude towards national product issues, which needs to be analyzed and studied by us.</p>
<p>(1) Urban Women. The dumping of most foreign goods is aimed at urban women as their direct consumers. The so-called modern women, from head to toe, all take pride in wearing foreign goods. Cosmetics, silks, and all household daily necessities, which one is not purchased by their delicate jade hands, with money flowing out in torrents. How can we not be surprised and amazed by this painful fact? But upon closer examination, the reason why urban women are like this is only because they are misled by a hateful vanity and bound by the general bad habits of society, so the loss of their nature is only temporary.</p>
<p>(2) Rural Women. Our country was originally an agricultural country, with its own mulberry farming and weaving, and the handicraft industry was very prosperous. Therefore, initially, there was no need for imported goods at all. However, since the opening of the sea, foreign goods have been dumped like mercury leaking onto the ground, and there has been no hole that they have not penetrated. Of course, rural women also purchase foreign goods, such as foreign cloth, matches, and all daily necessities, due to mixing fish eyes with pearls or because of the lure of low prices.</p>
<p>Then, based on the above facts, we can get a clear view. In relation to urban women and rural women, regarding the rejection of national products and the enjoyment of foreign goods, they have a clear distinction. One is entirely due to the instigation of vanity, and the other is due to the lure of low prices or simply blind purchasing. Therefore, our future work will be to guide them separately in this way in order to achieve complete success.</p>
<p>Family Visit Record</p>
<h3>Mrs. Yang Weiyu</h3>
<p>— Tianyun</p>
<p>Mrs. Yang Weiyu, is also Ms. Peng Wangfen, who is known for her literature. Ms. Peng graduated from teacher training and is a genius in literature. She works as a Chinese teacher at the China Vocational School. Her most proud work is a book published by the China Vocational Education Society called [Min'er's Mother], which is written with deep emotion and is deeply admired by readers. Recently, Mr. Yang and Ms. Peng participated in the Women's National Products Year Movement and wrote several articles for various newspapers promoting national products, which shows their enthusiasm and perseverance. One day, a reporter specially visited the home of Mr. and Mrs. Yang. The small room was very clean and simple. The tables, chairs, boxes, and cabinets were all arranged neatly. Mr. Yang was wearing cloth clothes, and Mrs. Yang was wearing domestic silks. Recently, Mr. Yang had a new set of domestic wool student clothes made, and Mrs. Yang also had a domestic wool coat made. The three children were all lively and wore domestic clothes, jumping back from school. Mrs. Yang also returned home after class to fulfill her duties as a mother. Mr. Yang came from a poor family. Recently, he published his [The Night Before Leaving Home] in [The Great Wall] , which was written with deep sincerity. Therefore, his daily life can be said to be simple and content. Mrs. Yang came from a prominent family in Wumen and was accustomed to being pampered since childhood, but after coming to the Yang family, she abandoned makeup, avoided extravagance, and was also diligent and thrifty, living the life of Liang Meng. They also implemented a policy of budgeting and final accounting when spending money. Currently, almost everything they wear, eat, and use is exclusively domestic products. Every needle, every thread, and every match is only sought from domestic products. Once, Mrs. Yang said to me, "I have traveled all over the China National Products Company and could not buy a single domestic needle. Later, after my investigation, the China National Products Company recently had products from the Qingdao Needle Company." Mrs. Yang said, "[During the Women's National Products Year, promoting national products can only start from household items. Domestic products have been improving day by day in recent years. In terms of clothing, food, and housing, whatever foreign products have, domestic products have as well. The decoration is beautiful and not inferior to foreign products, and they are economical and durable, and even surpass them. Why must we learn foreign airs and depend on foreign goods? For example, China has many fine candies, why must we have [chocolate]? Europeans and Americans all praise Huadiao wine, why must we have [whiskey]? China has many new products of silks, cloths, and wools, why must we have [Vienna], [Flannel], [Paris Satin]? Therefore, from now on, as long as we women first eliminate foreign goods and promote domestic goods within the scope of our households, this year's achievements will definitely be considerable. I hope that many women's groups will all get up and do it. I think the most easily visible thing this year is that the alarming number of imported goods can definitely be reduced." Ms. Peng's insights, and her enthusiasm and perseverance in implementing the promotion of national products, are truly admirable. Ms. Peng's family's simple and simple use of domestic products is especially worthy of our visit.</p>

<h3>Rational Concepts</h3>
<p>— Nie Zeng Jifen</p>
<p>Today, in discussing methods for promoting national products, please separate them from resisting foreign goods and enemy goods, and from promoting national products, and seek their prerequisite issues; First, we should promote rational concepts among Chinese people. Today, all kinds of failures in our country, and the corruption of various countries in the world, are all due to erroneous concepts. The main point is that pride in luxury and wealth is considered valuable, while being humble, poor, and lowly is considered shameful. Today, people often talk about promoting desires to promote culture, but in fact, desires and culture do not stand side by side. Only Eastern philosophers respect experience, and their theories are contrary to this, rewarding poverty and frugality, and condemning luxury and wealth. As for encouraging diligence and condemning pride and laziness, it goes without saying. Not to mention the times before the Zhou Dynasty, since the Han Dynasty, famous politicians, and poets since the Jin Dynasty, have had this clear expression, and those who established it as a theory were Confucius and Mencius. In the Analects, there are more than a dozen places where wealth and honor are condemned and poverty and frugality are rewarded. For example, Yan Hui's contentment with a bamboo basket of rice and a gourd of water in a humble alley, and Zilu's lack of shame in wearing a tattered robe, are all praised for their virtue. Yu the Great's meager diet, humble palaces, and distaste for fine clothes are all praised in admiration. All human beings inherently have the inferior roots of valuing wealth and despising poverty, and even with strong correction, it is difficult to change. Moreover, today, the evil wind of Western worship of money is being imported. What was considered wrong in the past is now considered right. Wherever there is profit, nothing is impossible, thus creating this deformed society and critical situation. The outflow of money, the withering of industry, and the large number of unemployed are all due to this.</p>
<p>In recent years, the surge in the import of foreign goods has been shocking. There are many reasons, but the advancement of fashion and art is a major aspect. In the past, female factory workers all wore short jackets made of coarse blue cloth. In recent years, most of them have cut their hair and wear long robes made of printed fine cloth. This clothing is beautiful and very cheap. The material for a robe costs only about two yuan. Female workers earn more than ten yuan a month, and they believe that they can afford it, so they are not stingy. However, each person needs to prepare three pieces for winter, summer, and spring. It is known without asking what country this cheap and beautiful printed fine cloth comes from. Families with better occupations make more beautiful clothes. In Shanghai alone, there are tens of thousands of female workers, and millions of other women. Extrapolating to the whole country, it accumulates into an astonishingly large number. For more than ten years, students have been competing to wear Western suits, which has already been a large expenditure, and the supplies associated with Western suits are even more enormous. Wealthy people's shoes and socks cost dozens of yuan, and they must change their clothes every time they go out, with those in high positions and those with higher education taking the lead in promoting it, and newspapers and newspapers promoting and encouraging it, and the whole country is swept away by it. Now, to remedy it, we still need to start with social leaders and women as role models, with simple decorations that are appropriate, so that everyone can create a new concept, considering thrift and simplicity as reasonable and splendor as unreasonable, and then we can talk about promoting national products. Gandhi advocated wearing cloth made of hand-spun yarn, using coarse cloth as a symbol of patriotism, and British exports to England dropped by half, which is ironclad evidence.</p>
<p>I have more to say, that is, recently women have been imitating Westerners by exposing their arms and legs, wearing high heels and long silk stockings, which is very meaningless. Nations should each have an independent spirit, how can they chase after others. Moreover, this kind of dress is not hygienic. I have seen friends who have broken their leg bones because of high heels, and it usually hinders operations, not to mention it. In winter, many people have colds and cannot leave their noses without handkerchiefs. Is it wise to sacrifice health and even life to pursue fashion? Curling hair into a curly shape, and having to go to a hair salon to do it, costs money and time, which is unnecessary. These are all unconscious behaviors of Westerners, and it is especially important to know that they are not things that should be in a reasonable life. What I have seen of Japanese women is that for fifty years, their clothing has not changed slightly, and except for prostitutes, almost no one has cut their hair. Can what our people do avoid their sneers?</p>
<p>Women's Talk on National Products</p>
<h3>Grandma's Tips on Everyday Life</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiacheng</p>
<p>亅Economic Recovery of Lost Territory丨</p>
<p>If you don't understand what the National Goods Movement is, or doubt the Women's National Goods Year, what I'm about to tell you isn't just empty talk, but a reminder of an old saying. It's said that since the opening of China to foreign trade, foreigners have given us three great gifts, or magic weapons: cannons, the Bible, and foreign goods.</p>
<p>Under the magic of cannons, from the Opium War to the January 28th Incident and the September 18th Incident, the benefits we've received, from the cession of Hong Kong to the Luan River war zone, have been the loss of all our vassal states and the change in color of our map. To this day, we are still calling for the recovery of lost territory.</p>
<p>The Bible issue seems to have shifted now. Christianity has mostly been transferred from foreign missionaries to Chinese believers. The past is gone, but the future is still within reach, so let's leave that aside for now.</p>
<p>Foreign goods were originally rare and exotic items, but the annual outflow of hundreds of millions of dollars is given to others because we consume foreign goods. This not only leads to our own people's poverty and depletion of wealth, but also makes many foreigners who come to China to sell goods rich. It is said that the guns and bullets they use to fight us contain the blood and sweat that they have squeezed from us.</p>
<p>This is the most reasonable calculation. If a family that is becoming increasingly poor and defeated wants to seek prosperity, the only way to do so is to start with thrift. This is what is meant by increasing income and reducing expenditure. Applying this principle to our economically distressed country, the only way to do it is to protect our original vitality and not let it be depleted. In other words, stop buying foreign goods and don't let money flow out of the country.</p>
<p>However, to go a step further, our daily lives cannot be forever self-sufficient, and we will inevitably have to buy things from outside. Therefore, we should understand that after curing a disease by removing the toxins, we must also cultivate our own original vitality. Then, we should cherish and promote domestically produced goods, because this is our own foundation, and only in this way can we achieve the goal of economic recovery of lost territory!</p>
<p>Accordingly, at the beginning of this Women's National Goods Year, when the women are responsible for doing the work, we must first establish these two concepts…</p>
<p>Why do we want to promote national goods? To achieve economic recovery of lost territory!</p>
<p>Why do we want to consume national goods? To achieve economic recovery of lost territory!</p>
<h3>Cosmetics</h3>
<p>— Hanyu</p>
<p>Setting: A richly decorated drawing room.</p>
<p>Time: 5 PM on a certain afternoon.</p>
<p>Characters: Father, Mother, Daughter.</p>
<p>(The curtain rises, the father is smoking in the drawing room, the daughter comes out from inside.)</p>
<p>Daughter: Dad... I want to go out and buy some things!</p>
<p>Father: What do you want to buy? (Puts hand into pocket, as if to take out money.)</p>
<p>Daughter: I want to buy some cosmetics.</p>
<p>Father: (Looking surprised.) Cosmetics? Isn't it better to use the ones we make ourselves? (Takes hand out of pocket.)</p>
<p>Daughter: The ones we make ourselves are only fit for workers to use. How could we possibly use them? (Acts haughty.)</p>
<p>Father: (Slightly angry.) You don't use the ones we make ourselves, but you want to use foreign goods. Do you know what patriotism is?</p>
<p>Daughter: (Turns her back to her father.) Patriotism is just a slogan. Anyway, I want to buy French goods.</p>
<p>Father: (Angry.) Patriotism is a slogan? Is that what you should be saying? I opened a cosmetics factory for the sake of patriotism. Is that also just a slogan? You want to abandon national goods and use foreign goods. That's the mentality of a slave!</p>
<p>Daughter: Don't you know? All my classmates use foreign goods. If I'm the only one using national goods, won't they laugh at me?</p>
<p>Father: (Very angry.) People will laugh at you for using national goods? They're willing to be slaves of a fallen nation. Are you also willing to be a slave of a fallen nation? The country has become so bad. It's all your fault! Now that the Women's National Goods Year is almost here, you still want to use foreign goods? Can you be considered a woman? Can you be considered a human being? Your classmates use foreign goods, you should persuade them to use national goods. It is the responsibility of every citizen to promote national goods. When I was in Japan, I saw that none of their people used foreign goods. That's a very good example! China is going to be ruined because everyone wants to use foreign goods! (Slams the table.)</p>
<p>Mother: (Coming out from inside.) What are you arguing about?</p>
<p>Father: (Pointing at the daughter to the mother.) We have our own cosmetics but she won't use them. She still wants to use foreign goods.</p>
<p>Mother: (To the daughter.) Why do you still want to use foreign goods? The ones we make ourselves are almost the same as foreign goods.</p>
<p>Daughter: I just don't believe that national goods are almost the same as foreign goods.</p>
<p>Mother: Isn't what I put on my face made by us? (Points to her face.)</p>
<p>Daughter: (Gets close to the mother, sniffs slightly.) This is produced by ×× Company. You're still trying to deceive me by saying it's national goods.</p>
<p>Mother: You don't believe me? Isn't what's on my dressing table made by us?</p>
<p>Daughter: You're trying to deceive me?</p>
<p>Mother: Why would I deceive you?</p>
<p>Daughter: Then I'll use national goods.</p>
<p>(Curtain closes.)</p>
<h3>The National Goods Scripture</h3>
<p>— Xu Nangong</p>
<p>In the National Goods Year, using national goods is as right as rain, unshakeable. Chinese people using Chinese goods, the nation prospers and wealth abounds. Factories rush to produce national goods, quality is excellent and sales are widespread. Crude and shoddy manufacturing is the wrong path, the survival of the fittest is inevitable. Stores sell domestically produced goods, business is booming and there are many customers. Don't try to disguise foreign goods as domestic, running dogs of merchants will eventually fail. Elderly people using domestic goods, live long, healthy, and wealthy lives. If you buy and use foreign goods, people will see you as senile. Wives should use Chinese goods, more happiness, longer lives, and great fortune. If you buy and use foreign goods, iron birds and bombs will bring disaster. Grandmothers who use Chinese goods are called virtuous mothers and good wives. If you use foreign goods, people will laugh and scold you as old spinsters. Young ladies should use domestic goods, modern and beautiful, that's the fashionable way. Anyone who buys and uses foreign goods will have a hard time marrying a good husband. Young people should use Chinese goods, single-mindedly save the country, don't be frivolous. If you love to use foreign goods, you will inevitably become a slave of a fallen nation. All Chinese people should use national goods, protect the country, protect the home, and protect the mountains and rivers. National goods are manufactured better than foreign goods, cheap, good quality, and many colors. Please don't think I'm blowing my own trumpet, economic invasion is as harmful as a tiger. The corner of the Northeast is broken, everyone must remember clearly. Everyone should rush to use national goods, the prison of a fallen nation can still be repaired.</p>
<p>Trifles</p>
<p>— Qiacheng</p>
<h3>(1) Overture</h3>
<p>Because the stones from other hills can polish jade, in this Chinese Women's National Goods Year, let us see how other people are acting. Ladies and gentlemen, these are trifles, but hopefully those who speak are unintentional, and those who listen are intentional!</p>
<h3>(2) French Women</h3>
<p>Mr. Kong Yongzhi said after returning from an inspection in Europe... [We must not misunderstand that France is an extremely luxurious country. French farmers are very practical in what they do.] As far as I know, the cosmetics sold in Paris are all genuine [Made in France]. Even if French women are extravagant, perfume has not become a drain on our wealth!</p>
<h3>(3) American Beer</h3>
<p>The American prohibition has been lifted under the Blue Eagle policy. However, the beer that Americans drink, the beer they make themselves, has a larger market than French champagne.</p>
<h3>(4) Jia Bao Travels to France</h3>
<p>The mysterious woman Jia Bao, on her last return to her country after leaving the United States, passed through France. Parisian merchants were prepared to do a lot of business, but in the end, she did not buy a single thing. She returned empty-handed from a mountain of treasure. The clever French goods never managed to exchange for the money of this Swedish girl.</p>
<h3>(5) Japanese Housewives</h3>
<p>It is said that after Japanese girls marry far away to China, many Japanese housewives still can't forget Japan (of course, there are exceptions). The most obvious proof is that they will set up a home for you with purely Japanese-made appliances.</p>
<h3>The Development After the Reorganization of the Huada Handkerchief Factory</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Since our country was forced open by the great powers with cannons, it has been followed by economic invasion, with goods arriving in a continuous stream. Our fat and cream have been sucked dry. The September 18th Incident occurred, and the national situation became as precarious as a pile of eggs. If we do not rise up to seek survival, even if we do not perish in the cannons, we will still perish in the chronic economic invasion! Cantonese people Wang Zijia, Xiao Guihong, Wang Yulin, Ma Fan, Huang Qin and other gentlemen, feeling the responsibility that everyone has for the rise and fall of the world, practiced national salvation at their own posts. In the autumn of the 21st year of the Republic of China, they raised funds to found the Huada Handkerchief Factory in Hong Kong, equipped with new-style machines, and manufactured various handkerchiefs. It was also registered with the Chinese, British, and Philippine governments, using three sheep as its trademark. Although handkerchiefs seem like a small thing, they are actually a necessity of daily life. Society's ladies all have one in their hands. And when you trace its origins, they are all foreign goods. The products originally made in our own country were crudely made, and almost no one paid attention to them. Huada, on the other hand, uses the same machinery as foreign goods, extracts the strengths of others, and is based on scientific principles, striving for excellence. The raw materials are taken from our own country, so the goods are of good quality and low price, surpassing imported goods. Only four months after opening, sales have spread all over the world, and the factory's products are in short supply. Therefore, they are even more eager to improve. Since Hong Kong is located in a remote corner, it is only beneficial for promoting sales abroad. It is inconvenient to promote sales domestically. Moreover, in the midst of the current advocacy of national goods to save the country, it is not enough to resist imports and recover profit rights without strong capital and a large scale. It is particularly necessary to increase capital and reorganize into a limited company. After discussion and decision, expansion was immediately started. In addition to adding machines to increase production, a branch factory was established in Guangzhou to facilitate domestic sales. Since then, business has become more developed. Domestically, Huada is sold all over China. Abroad, it has a lively and prosperous situation in Southeast Asia, Little Luzon, Siam, Singapore, and other places. The factory is still not satisfied. On the one hand, it is working hard to promote sales. On the other hand, it is working hard to improve manufacturing, aiming at modernization. Therefore, the products have become increasingly exquisite in recent days. Since the increase in tax rates has increased the cost for those who purchase in the mainland, it inevitably affects sales. The factory did not hesitate to sacrifice profits and reduce the selling price to circumvent tariffs, and sales have increased as a result. In short, since the expansion and reorganization of the factory, the development of its business has made great strides. It is truly a vital force in resisting foreign goods. If other businessmen in our country have this enthusiasm and perseverance to engage in national salvation at their own posts, then the disappearance of foreign goods from our country's market is a matter of sincerity.</p>
<h3>Children's Year in the Women's National Goods Year</h3>
<p>— Shi Jihong</p>
<p>Almost everyone knows this... This year is the Women's National Goods Year and also the Children's Year. The Women's National Goods Year is to make our 200 million female compatriots abandon foreign goods and switch to national goods. This is certainly true. All the foreign perfumes, powders, and the most fashionable European and American woolen and silk fabrics on every modern lady, if converted into bullets at sixteen yuan per thousand, then five thousand bullets would be the bare minimum.</p>
<p>But then again, in this Women's National Goods Year, good mothers and virtuous sisters, in addition to using national goods themselves and in their families, must also work towards the future masters of the Republic of China. Nine out of ten of the things that children wear, use, and play with are bought for them by their mothers and sisters. If, in the current Women's National Goods Year, smart and kind mothers and sisters should not only use national goods as their priority for themselves and their families, but should also make an effort to buy and use national goods for their own children, and train them to use national goods, eradicating the inferior habit of loving foreign goods that has already been pre-existing in children's hearts, then not only will this Women's National Goods Year not be wasted in the present, but also for the children of my country in the future thousands of years, a foundation for loving and using national goods will have been laid in advance. This is really a major event in the Women's National Goods Year.</p>
<p>Finally, I must also contribute something, that is, many toys and daily necessities should be taught to children to make themselves, to do it themselves, so that they have the spirit of self-reliance and creation, and unyielding perseverance. If we work towards children in this way, this Women's National Goods Year will have real meaning. It is much better than just shouting slogans. I respectfully use two old sayings to end this article.</p>
<p>Better to act than to sit and talk.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The National Goods Kissing Ceremony</h3>
<p>— Zhang</p>
<p>Mr. Gu sat alone on the sofa, a cigarette in his mouth and the Shen Bao newspaper in his hand, reading the newspaper and smoking a cigarette by himself. His wife, Mrs. Xiuwen, also sat opposite him, silently reading a recently published ×× Weekly. The air in the living room was unusually quiet, only the clock on the wall was ticking.</p>
<p>[Alas! Chinese people really have no way. Last year was the National Goods Year, but not only did the promotion of the nation fail to show any special achievements, but it gave foreign goods a chance to sell well. According to the records in the newspaper... [The excess of imports over exports in the first half of last year was about 47,400,000 yuan, and the total for the year was about 90 million yuan. On average, each of us has to bear more than two yuan in foreign goods alone. Alas! How can we not be heartbroken to think of this situation? But, it is hateful that the general women still think of themselves as modern and buy foreign goods as much as possible, regardless of the crisis of the country, society, and nation, and specialize in making efforts to use foreign goods... We, the people who are engaged in the National Goods Movement and promote national goods to save the country, what else can we say about this situation besides deeply sighing for the future of the nation? ...] Mr. Gu's words were full of indignation. This indignant, oratory tone suddenly broke the silent air of the entire room and moved Mrs. Xiuwen as well.</p>
<p>[Indeed, what you said is not wrong at all. If China is always like this, if the Chinese people are always not enlightened, only selling and looking up to foreign goods and despising domestic goods, then the crisis in the future cannot be ignored. And we women's circles should also bear a large part of the responsibility for national goods, because most of the women are in control of the family's economy...] Mr. Gu's wife, Mrs. Xiuwen, followed her husband's words. At the same time, when she said [Most of the family economy is in the hands of women], she couldn't help but smile and blush on both cheeks. She looked at Mr. Gu, and Mr. Gu also smiled at her, because Mr. Gu's family economy was also in the hands of his wife, Mrs. Xiuwen!</p>
<p>[Even though that's the case, it's not easy to get the general women to wake up together, right? Therefore, our colleagues in the National Goods circles made a fierce decision to set this year as the Women's National Goods Year, preparing to specialize in doing the work of the Women's National Goods Movement in this one year. I think if the general women can have a common awakening, the National Goods Movement can be said to be half successful. Do you think that's right?]</p>
<p>[This year is the Women's National Goods Year? That's great. From today onwards, I will definitely be a propagandist for the Women's National Goods Movement, uniting the general sisters to use national goods together, to fulfill your painstaking efforts, and to shoulder my responsibilities. What do you think, is it worth implementing?]</p>
<p>[Of course, that's great. If you can stand on my front line and work together on the work of the National Goods Movement, then you will be worthy of being my wife, the wife of the National Goods Doctor, (Mr. Gu has the alias of National Goods Doctor). From now on, I will call you the National Goods Lady!]</p>
<p>Saying that, they couldn't help but smile at each other. In the midst of the smiles, Mr. Gu walked closer to his wife, held her waist, and deeply kissed a sweet, long kiss on Mrs. Xiuwen's face. It can also be said that [it was Mr. Gu and his wife's ceremony of swearing to strive for the National Goods Movement.]</p>

<h3>[The Reason for Literal Translation]</h3>
<p>— Zuo Yangling</p>
<p>I happened to read Ma Xulun's [Reading Notes,] and saw the following item...</p>
<p>Recently, in a notebook, there was a joke about translation, saying that the Chinese phrase [驰骋书丛] "galloping through the book forest" was translated by the English as [Riding a horse through the book piles, running back and forth.] This is due to literal translation. But there is also a real story about this. The Jin scholar Zhang Jun drafted an edict of amnesty for Emperor Xizong, which contained the phrases [顾兹寡昧] "Considering my ignorance" and [眇予小子] "I, the blind little one." The translator said [Lonely and without relatives, not understanding things,] [Blind child]. Emperor Xizong used a sword to cut off Zhang Jun's mouth and pickle it in minced meat.</p>
<p>I only heard from my elders when I was a child that it is wrong to lie to people. Those who lie will have their tongues cut out and their intestines drawn out when they die and go to the underworld. Today I understand that translating incorrectly can also lead to having two pieces of lip skin cut off and chopped into minced meat. I am also someone who occasionally dabbles in translation. Isn't that a very dangerous situation!</p>
<p>The above is the story of the Jin Dynasty. That translator was also the emperor's personal translator, so he suffered such a tragic fate. We don't need to worry today, more than seven hundred years later, when there is no emperor. But looking at the momentum of the translators who have been attacking [literal translation] or [hard translation] in recent years, it can be said to be fierce. If they one day have power in their hands, even if they don't take out the means of [using a sword to cut off the mouth and pickle it in minced meat], they will at least make [literal translation] or [hard translation] unable to exist.</p>
<p>Translating [驰骋书丛] "galloping through the book forest" as [riding a horse through the book piles, running back and forth], and translating [眇予小子] "I, the blind little one" as [blind child] This kind of translation is indeed laughable and hateful, but in my opinion, this is not [literal translation] or [hard translation]. This is like [milk road], but [milk road] is [smooth translation]. Mr. Ma Xulun gave such an example and said [This is due to literal translation], which is really wrong.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lin Yutang, Pearl S. Buck's complete translation of "Water Margin" has been published. Mr. Lin is carefully proofreading it, and in the first few chapters, he has already found one mistake, which is to translate the [朝] "court" character in [仁宗朝] "Emperor Renzong's reign" into the [朝] "to visit" character in the English word [visiting]. This is also very laughable, but according to Mr. Lin, other than that, it is really well translated and very faithful. Moreover, Pearl S. Buck is hoping that Chinese readers will point out her mistakes so that she can correct them.</p>
<p>I think the attitude of translation 丨丨 whether he advocates [smooth translation] or [literal translation] [hard translation] 丨丨 should be like Pearl S. Buck. [It is better to be smooth and not faithful than to be faithful and not smooth] Although it is the opinion of a learned person, it is not entirely good after all. As for the critics, instead of pointing out one or two mistakes and spreading them as jokes, it is better to point out all the mistakes and call on the translator to correct them.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Changing Colors of Maps</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Last year, I saw the supplement [Latest World Political and Economic Map] in the New Year's issue of the Japanese magazine [Kaizo]. In it, the land of our [Republic of China] was densely covered with large dots of various colors, saying that those dots represented the spheres of influence of the great powers. [Manchukuo] was of course the same color as Japan. Things always happen in pairs. The day before yesterday, a certain newspaper reported that the December issue of the American magazine [TheGoography] had a map attached to it that painted our four northeastern provinces in red, labeled them as Japanese territory (the same color as Japan), and printed the words [Manchukuo]; In addition, the Canadian Manufacturers Life Insurance Company published an advertising calendar with a world map, which painted Manchuria in red and our country in yellow.</p>
<p>I am not someone who discusses national affairs, but because [Manchukuo] is mentioned, I always feel a little personal pain. Now that I hear that the colors of the map are changing, I can't help but shed a few tears of an exile in my heart.</p>
<p>But I also feel that those who draw maps, although they have ulterior motives, are in some places worthy of our admiration. As the saying goes... [A bright person does not do secret things.] I think it is also admirable for someone who supports bandits and commits treason to be able to confess it himself. I don't like people who [shake things under a cover] the most. It is good for us that they express it frankly and clearly, so that we can be alert and clearly understand our position. And those who draw maps are even more worthy of our gratitude if they are standing on the position of exposing traitors. In short, the people of the Northeast have been slaves of a fallen nation for two or three years. This is a fact known to the world and tacitly approved by some people. They tell us clearly, which also saves us from having to doubt. We can see those colors on the map every day, so that we don't forget that we are being slaves of a fallen nation.</p>
<p>The people of our China must know why we have reached this point, and strive to seek a way to solve it. I think we can no longer hold on to the principle of [Don't wash your dirty linen in public]. It would naturally be good if we could overcome the disgrace of the family and revitalize the family's reputation early on. If we can't overcome it, and we just stick to the principle of not publicizing it, how can that help the matter?</p>
<p>We need to recover lost territory. What do we need that nominal territory for? If the Northeast is actually occupied by the Japanese, but the map is still painted in Chinese colors, what good is that to us? We want reality to match the name. How can we recover lost territory? This is the question that we must always consider.</p>
<p>The newspaper that published the above news added an editor's note at the end, saying... [Such illegal publications should be severely banned, and relations should be made with the relevant countries to prohibit them]. I think that as long as we recover the lost territory, there will naturally be no more maps of that kind without us banning or negotiating to prohibit them. As long as we completely drive out the forces of those ambitious invading countries, and we can truly be independent, then those colored dots will be cancelled even if we don't negotiate. But how can we do that? This is what we want to ask.</p>
<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>— Xu Fu</p>
<p>[Silence is the best expression of everything. Our whispers of love are not yet the ultimate achievement of love; our cries to heaven are not yet the expression of the greatest sorrow. The expression in these moments should be a fossil-like, dead silence.] These few words of Mr. Zhou Zuoren express the essence of sorrow and joy.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qie, in [The Face After Dinner], also has a good description of the ultimate love. He said, [The sweeter it is, the less visible; the truer it is, the less visible. The less visible, the sweeter; the truer, the more easily it melts, the more ardent.] [This is unclear, unseen, unseeable, unbearable. It shouldn't be seen, even though in this instant, the mind depicts goodness, truth, and beauty. Not only are true lovers like this, but even disguised lovers are like this. When movies depict the sweetness of love between men and women, they embrace, and the man either slightly raises his head or looks at the woman's hair, gently stroking her, never studying her face to face; and the woman is happiest when she closes her eyes, not only not looking at the other person, but not looking at anything at all.] This is the same view as Mr. Zhou.</p>
<p>The sorrowful side is no exception. When we hear loud wailing, we don't feel particularly uncomfortable; what we fear most is the low sobbing that comes from afar on a stormy night. The same is true of facial expressions; a face of great anger is not terrifying, but what makes us tremble is the fossil-like, expressionless dead silence. When a woman is wronged, she will cry bitterly. A good husband, besides comforting her, should probably let her cry to her heart's content. Once she has cried enough, the grievance will disappear. Because this crying is not real sorrow. It does no harm to health. On the contrary, wanting to cry but having no tears, wanting to cry but not daring to, that is the profound pain in the world. Also, consider resentment. The short-sleeved friends sitting in tea houses and taverns are not only more straightforward than those in long gowns, but their gratitude and resentment are also much shallower. They immediately become brothers with a word of agreement, but instantly turn hostile with two words of disagreement. However, once victory or defeat is determined, the hatred is also released, and they are still brothers and one family. Long-gowned friends are not like this. Even a small flaw will be repaid many times over, and on the surface, they are smiling, but their hearts are more sinister than sharp knives. So, true gratitude and resentment are revealed in plainness or smiles; when faces are red and breathless, they seem very serious, but the matter is forgotten after it is over.</p>
<p>Speaking of anger again. When anger makes one's hair stand on end and push up one's hat, it has naturally reached its peak. But when the hat falls to the ground, or one's anger subsides. The greatest anger is not when hair can push up a hat, but when one wears a thousand-pound stone cauldron on one's head, preventing the expression of anger and forcing it to turn into a cold protest.</p>
<p>Cold anger is true anger. We can find it on the faces of child brides in the past, apprentices in southern stores, maidservants, slaves in colonies, in short, on the faces of all slaves wearing stone cauldrons.</p>
<p>They all become silent, a fossil-like dead silence. But they are not dead, they are still resisting. A nation, a country's subjects sometimes fall into this state, and this is the greatest anger.</p>
<h3>Wells' Prediction: A Chronicle of the Sino-Japanese War in 1935 (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhen</p>
<p>The actions of various countries to punish Japan were only made clear at this time. Not only were European and American armaments factories selling submarines and mines, but also the navies of various countries, under the guise of saving expenses, dismantled their new weapons into parts, transported them to Chile in South America, and then from Chile to Manila, and then secretly handed them over to China. The Philippine Islands, as a base for Chinese submarines, greatly threatened Japan's maritime traffic. Seeing this situation, Japan disregarded treaties and built more submarine bases on the South Sea Islands. The American fleet, to protect the neutrality of the Philippine Islands, concentrated on Guam, while Japanese warships concentrated on the Chinese seas to blockade the Chinese coast. At this time, although the Japanese-American war had not yet broken out, the situation in the Western Pacific was very tense. Because to prevent the transport of arms to China, in 1936, two American submarines were sunk by Japan in the Chinese seas. Japanese submarines also appeared near Guam from time to time. Then, in 1937, the United States and Japan engaged in an unofficial naval war in the Western Pacific.</p>
<p>However, neither country issued a declaration of war. Roosevelt II, as a result of the adventurous nature of his economic policies, found himself in dire financial straits. Japan was also doing its utmost to carry out an expedition to strike at the heart of China. At this time, American conservatives suddenly changed their minds and, in order to vent domestic discontent, also advocated declaring war on Japan. They advocated re-annexing the Philippine Islands. When Japan's Wuchang expedition failed, the argument for war against Japan in the United States became unstoppable.</p>
<p>This Japanese-American war was short and not the final decisive battle, so it is omitted. The encounter between the two countries in the Pacific only lasted two days, after which the Japanese side, running out of ammunition, finally retreated under cover of a smokescreen at dusk. Japan thus ceded the sea lanes to submarines, while the main fleet retreated to ports with torpedo facilities, because of a lack of supplies, it no longer appeared at sea. On the other hand, the American fleet took this opportunity to sail triumphantly to Manila and announced a naval victory.</p>
<p>At this time, the domestic situations in both Japan and the United States were deteriorating rapidly, making it difficult for both countries to continue the war. Therefore, this Japanese-American war ended without a decisive battle and without any treaty. Both Japan and the United States had to deal with social reforms due to their respective domestic collapses.</p>
<p>The following year, in 1940, the scene of the war shifted to the European continent. The result of this war was that the entire European continent was reduced to scorched earth. The records of that time have not been preserved at all. The only remaining war record in the world is the diary of a Japanese officer from the Wuchang retreat, but it is fragmentary and unsystematic. However, we can still imagine from it the horror of the burning and killing at that time, which is unbearable to read. This officer probably died in Kaifeng.</p>
<p>×　　×　　×</p>
<p>The above is Wells' dream about the war in the Far East. As for the predictions about the war in Europe, fortunately, they can be found in the original book, and the length here does not allow me to continue talking like this, so I will stop here. (End)</p>
<h3>Selected News Notes</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>(1) The Story</p>
<p>Film star Hu Die was hired by the Nanjing Grand Theater to perform a stage play in Nanjing, which was extremely popular. On the 11th, the hotel where Hu was staying received a letter warning Hu Die, with a bullet attached. The content roughly stated that Hu Die, in North China, with a song and a dance, had ruined half of the country. Now she has come to Nanjing to be charming, and the people of Nanjing do not want to see this captivating face or hear this song of national destruction. If she lingers any longer, she will be shot with a similar bullet.</p>
<p>A reporter from a certain newspaper wrote a poem:</p>
<p>In Nanjing, there is a anti-traitor group, sending letters with bullets attached...</p>
<p>Quickly move to a peaceful land, to settle your old cases.</p>
<p>Leave Nanjing, Butterfly! Return, Butterfly!</p>
<p>(2) Notes</p>
<p>The True Story of Ah Q says... Most Chinese men could have been sages, but unfortunately, they were all ruined by women. The Shang dynasty was destroyed by Daji; the Zhou dynasty was ruined by Bao Si; the Qin... although there is no clear record in history, we also assume that he was ruined by women, which is probably not entirely wrong; and Dong Zhuo was indeed killed by Diao Chan.</p>

<p>Lady Huarui wrote a poem... The king raised the surrender flag on the city, how could I know in the deep palace? One hundred and forty thousand men laid down their armor, not a single one was a man.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (8)(9)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Everyone finally came out of the small room and onto the deck, which was crowded with people, porters, and sailors.</p>
<p>The steam in the ship's belly hummed, as if shivering with impatience.</p>
<p>"Goodbye," Roland kept saying hurriedly.</p>
<p>"Goodbye," Lierre replied, standing on the narrow bridge connecting the "Lorraine" and the dock.</p>
<p>He shook hands with everyone once more, and then his family walked away.</p>
<p>"Hurry, hurry, get in the car!" the father shouted.</p>
<p>A hired carriage was waiting for them to take them to the port, where Babagri had the "Pearl" yacht ready and waiting for them to set sail.</p>
<p>There was no wind that day; it was a dry and calm autumn day, and the polished sea surface was as cold and hard as steel.</p>
<p>Jean grabbed one oar, and Babagri took the other, and they both rowed together. On the breakwater, on both banks, and even on the granite railings, there were countless wriggling, clamoring crowds, waiting for the "Lorraine" to pass. The "Pearl" passed through these two waves of people and sailed out of the harbor in a moment.</p>
<p>Captain Bozire sat between the two ladies, holding the tiller and saying...</p>
<p>"You'll see, we'll be waiting right in its path, right there, right there."</p>
<p>The two rowers rowed as hard as they could to get as far away as possible. Suddenly, Roland shouted...</p>
<p>"Look, I see its masts and those two chimneys. It has left the dock.</p>
<p>"Row hard, boys!" Captain Bozire repeatedly shouted.</p>
<p>Roland's mother took her handkerchief out of her bag and put it to her eyes.</p>
<p>Roland stood holding the mast, reporting...</p>
<p>"Now it's heading to the harbor... it's stopped... it's moving again... it's hooked up to the tugboat... it's moving forward... great! It has entered the two banks... do you hear the audience cheering... great! ... The tugboat towing it is the "Le Poudeau" tugboat... I can see its bow now... look, look... good heavens, what a majestic ship! Good heavens! Look!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Luceme and Captain Bozire turned around; the two rowers also stopped rowing; only Roland's mother did not move.</p>
<p>The huge mail ship, towed by a pair of powerful tugboats that seemed as small as silkworms in front of it, slowly, majestically, left the harbor. The crowds of Le Havre, crowded on the shore, on the beach, and in the windows, were suddenly inspired by a patriotic heart, shouting madly, "Long live the Lorraine!" They cheered and applauded for this heroic departure, this birth of a beautiful daughter of the sea in the great coastal city. But the mail ship, once it passed through the narrow passage enclosed by two granite walls, finally felt free and immediately abandoned its tugboats, walking alone like a giant monster running on the water.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Quiet and Stable in the Morning</h3>
<p>Exchange Rate and Silver Price Retreat</p>
<p>The Situation is Not Very Strong</p>
<p>The gold market was stable yesterday. The market in the morning was initially firm but then weakened. Although there were many struggles in the middle, the situation was not very strong. Although there were overseas telegrams, they did not have much impact and the fluctuations were narrow. In the morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US retreated in unison. The far-term silver price on the Five Metals Exchange fell by only 5 to 1.3% . The exchange rate fell sharply. American cotton fell 14 pounds per sound. American wheat fell 1 and 1/8 points. The wool market opened up to 81 yuan, but there was a sudden supply at the high price, and large accounts came out, so it fell. After the opening, as the exchange market hardened, the gold price followed the downstream trend. Afterwards, the HSBC Bank lowered the US exchange rate by 375 points. Foreign telegrams said that US Republican senators opposed the president's forcing the Federal Reserve Bank's funds to be handed over to the government for use. People's hearts were slightly calmer, and buying suddenly surged. Sassoon Bank hoarded US dollars, and Western merchant speculators also replenished their positions. The domestic market tightened, and the gold price seemed to be rising, but because the banks took advantage of the high prices to sell again, the market was hovering at noon. The supply and demand in the market were balanced, and it was difficult for any special changes to occur. The spot price was 1,072 yuan, because the price of raw gold in London rose by 3 shillings and 3 pence, and the US official gold buying price rose by 3.9 cents. I will now record the market conditions for half a day,</p>
<p>The morning opened at 6 and a half yuan. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of English exchange at 1 shilling, 4 pence and 3125 points. The US exchange rate was 34 yuan and 5625 points. The market was still uncertain when it opened. Zhengjin sold March US dollars at 875 points, and Hua Bi sold May US dollars at 35 and a half yuan. Fuchang, Fuyu, Hengyu, Qianchang, Xiang Da, Decheng, Yuanmao Yong, etc. continuously sold bullion, and it fell to 3 and 3/10 of a yuan. Hua Bi Zhengjin Xian bought May US dollars at 5625 points and stabilized. The HSBC Bank listed English exchange at a flat price and US exchange at a 375 point reduction. After the announcement, Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yuanyuan, Chang Yonghengtai, etc. came in at over 5 yuan, but there were many struggles along the way. Afterwards, Sassoon Bank strongly bought April US dollars at 1875 points, and Hua Bi actually paid 125 points. Foreign telegrams said that US Republicans opposed the president's forcing the Federal Reserve Bank's cash to be nationalized. Qingfa, Yongzhao, Fengchang, Hongli, etc. even came in at 6 yuan and 8 jiao. Citibank sold March US dollars at 875 points, and Yida Yong sold bullion and fell, but Bingxing came in, and the market hovered at around 6 yuan. Macaulay, etc. came out with March US dollars at 875 points, and May US dollars at 4375 points were difficult to sell. Yuanmao Yong Zhifeng Yong came to supply bullion, and the price was lowered to 4 yuan, but Zhengjin, Dongya, Macaulay, etc. continuously bought May US dollars at half a yuan, and the situation remained stable. Hengxing occasionally accepted bullion, and then rose to 5 yuan. The market closed in the afternoon at 674 yuan and 6 jiao. Goods were auctioned at 4 yuan and 7 jiao. After the market closed, Bingxing bought bullion, and the price finally rose to 5 and a half yuan. It was found that the highest price in the morning was 676 yuan and 8 jiao, and the lowest price was 673 yuan and 3 jiao, with a fluctuation of 3 and a half yuan. As a result, the closing price was slightly higher than the previous closing price by 4 jiao.</p>
<p>The announced price was because the HSBC Bank's US dollar listing was reduced by 375 points, to 34 yuan and 125 points. The combined gold price was 703 yuan. According to the closing price, the discount was about 29 yuan, which was more than 7 yuan higher than before. The account price for this month was 698 yuan, for February it was 689 yuan, and for March it was 675 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 698 yuan. The spot price was 1,072 yuan, because the price of raw gold in London soared. The Tianjin gang still supplemented their positions, and Daxie Chengtai Kangrun, etc. supplied about 1,000 taels, with prices ranging from 1,072 yuan to 74 yuan. After that, the guest gang and the industry had mutual entries and exits, but there were not many transactions. The swap market was deserted. Generally, there were bulls willing to swap at 14 yuan, and bears only at 13 yuan, but in comparison, bulls were more eager to swap, while bears, such as the Guangdong gang, were calm. There seemed to be no transactions in the morning. There were 1,841 taels of bullion left for this month.</p>
<p>The transactions in the market were average. In summary, Hengxing Qingfa Yong Bingxing Yiyu Zhaofengchang Yuanchang Yong Hongli Dachangxiang Yuanchang Hengchang Yong Fuyu Hengyu Shunli Wanxing, etc. were on the buying side. Qianchangxiang Hengtai Yuanmao Futai Hengyong De Hengxingyuan Daxing Yong Hui Xiang Yifeng Yong Yida Yong Xiexing Yong Yongfeng Sida Futai Heng, etc. were on the selling side. Yuanmao Yong Dade Cheng Hengyu Fuyu first sold and then bought. The Dalian gang Shunli traded a total of 1,300 taels, with a net entry of 300 taels. Wanxing traded a total of more than 900 taels, with a net entry of more than 400 taels. The Guangdong gang Hengxing entered more than 600 taels, with a small number of exits.

<p>Securities and Debt Market Not Out of Hovering State</p>
<h3>Generally Better Up 5 Points to 3 and a Half Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was relatively stable, but it was only to level out with the price of the previous day. The hovering situation is still trying to get rid of it. The floating long has reduced the exit, and the floating short has slightly offset it, but there are still many people shorting. Judging from the current situation, the anti-Central affairs have been completely subdued, and the increase in tariff rates will soon be realized, so the market price should still have a rising trend. Judging from the popular sentiment, most people believe that the market price has reached a high seat, and there is little hope for bulls. The Fourth Plenary Session, what will be the decision on the proposal for the Southwest? The relationship between this meeting and the safety of the current situation is not shallow, and it is not unreasonable for those who look at the small to do so. Judging from the chips, the number of deposits is still huge. If the environment changes slightly, the trend of mutual crushing will inevitably be small. Therefore, the hovering decision will be temporary and not long. In the two morning markets, because the floating short was slightly offset and swapped, the market price was slightly better, and each market was slightly better by 12 jiao, and the trend was stable and stagnant. After the afternoon opening, only the salt tax was slightly smaller by 5 points, and the rest still had short positions slightly swapped, continuing to be better by 12 jiao. At the closing, the bulls on the desk were quite willing to exit, and unanimously returned to loose by 12 jiao, and the trend was still in the process of hovering brewing. As a result, the market price generally rose by 5 points to 3 and a half jiao. Only the unified tax, Zheng Liu and Jiu Liu, were slightly smaller by 5 points or about 1 jiao, The total number of transactions was 12,141,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods, 4.78 million in futures unified salt tax, 2.09 million in troop reduction, 850,000 in the 19 customs duty, 2.44 million in the 20-volume 20-customs duty, and 1.28 million in Jin Duan Zheng Liu, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 200,000 to 300,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>New F丰 洋行 reported on the 16th: The New York stock market continued to rise, but due to active profit-taking by bulls, the advance was very slow. Trading was still brisk. Foreign investors were also buying. Wall Street believes Roosevelt's declaration is exceptionally good because the government's reduction of the dollar's gold content is mostly clear, and there was no mention of inconvertible paper money. Therefore, speculators infer that such paper money will not be issued. The total volume of transactions for the day was 354,000 shares. (Wheat) down by slightly over one cent, a natural reaction after the high surge the previous day. It can be bought again if it falls further. (Cotton) Opinions diverge on the currency control policy. Future market trends may again follow the acreage reduction plan, but as cotton prices rise daily, the achievement of acreage reduction becomes increasingly difficult. Today, bulls took profits at high prices, and the market trend narrowed. The Stabilization Fund bought gold at a price of $34.45 per tael, up 3.9 cents. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Weak Actual Sales Cause Yarn and Cotton to Decline</h3>
<p>The yarn market weakened again because actual yarn sales are sluggish. Dealers from various provinces are showing little interest, and overseas cotton markets are also reacting downward, weakening sentiment. According to some, there are still 6,000 to 7,000 bales to be delivered this month, so the market is particularly weak. Further-out months are slightly tighter and more expensive, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yarn Falls One Yuan This Month</h3>
<p>The open of the Renbiao market saw falling American cotton and weak buying interest, with all months falling by 134 points. In the afternoon, news emerged that spot yarn transactions were not smooth, and the market remained weak, with all months falling another 3, 4, and 7 points. The total volume of transactions for the day was 6,600 bales. It was found that Taichang sold 400 bales, Shenji 550 bales, Yichang 400 bales, Xiesheng 400 bales, and Tongxing 450 bales. Changfeng bought 1,350 bales, Ren 150 bales, Dachang 300 bales, Tonghe 250 bales, and Yi 2300 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>February 1757 727,750 Total 127,950</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Total Just Over 400 Bales</h3>
<p>The liquidation of spot yarn remains sluggish. It was found that dealers from various provinces bought a total of only 418 bales throughout the day. The market is stable. The purchase amounts for each province are as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou 120 Nanjing 12 Sichuan 100 Yunnan 20</p>
<p>Inland 156 Ningbo Guangdong 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is showing signs of reaction, and with American cotton falling, the yarn market is depressed, and factories are not buying much spot cotton. Therefore, sentiment is softening again. At the same time, profit-taking short positions are closing out. However, the Ningbo bulls have not completely exited the market, and they are still bullish. If foreign cotton turns downward, the cotton market may stabilize; otherwise, there will still be turmoil.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Shows Slight Decline</h3>
<p>The open of the Zheng Biao market followed the fall in foreign cotton, and buying households also fell, with all months falling by 1 to 1.5 points. In the afternoon, there was profit-taking by bulls, and all months fell by 0.5 to 1 point. The total volume of transactions for the day was 49,300 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 3,200 dan, Dafu 1,000 dan, Zhenda 1,300 dan, Xinheng 5,100 dan, Yuanda 1,300 dan, and Yuanxingchang 3,900 dan.

<p>Hankou Fine Velvet 41.00 Chongxin Factory Purchased 200 Pieces Sent to Factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 46.25 46.00 Tongxing Factory Purchased 200 Pieces Also</p>

<h3>Biao Flour Sees Bulls Selling Off</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the market for all months turned to a looser trend. Because the quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago, fell by about 34 points, and Canada fell by about 3 points, sentiment was already flat and weak at the opening. Furthermore, the major factories have been selling off a considerable number of long positions for this month, and the guest traders have little intention of buying far-out months, so the market is consistently looser, falling by 12 points or so compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the market for all months had entered a sideways pattern. Near-term months were weak but stabilized because factories stopped selling. However, the Tianjin traders were selling off distant months, causing sentiment to weaken again. With the end of the year approaching, it is feared that it will have to be temporarily suspended. As a result, this month fell by 1.25 points compared to the previous day, February to April fell by 1 point, and May and June fell by 1.5 points.</p>
<h3>Futures and Spot Wheat Markets Are Equally Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the market for all months softened due to the foreign wheat quotation falling by about 34 points. February and March fell by 23 points compared to the previous day, but trading was very light, and the rest were empty.</p>
<p>In the afternoon opening, this month only opened at one price and did not open again afterwards. February, March, April, and May were all empty. The June new wheat trading was still brisk, initially opening at 7.6 points, and then slightly better by 5 points due to some buying by inland traders. However, future transactions are difficult to develop due to settlement. The spot wheat has not been delivered because the factories have not moved. It is estimated that high-quality goods will have to open at around 1 point, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Trends in the North and South Rice Markets Are Slightly Different</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, there were more than 40 sources (over 5,000 shi), with late rice accounting for about half. Although guest traders' bids were tight, the outflow of goods was still smooth. Middle-grade late rice showed potential, and high-quality rice mostly went to warehouses, so there was no gain or loss. It is estimated that a total of 3,000 packages went to the Gong traders and warehouses. Various local thick japonica rice shops were slightly more active, and the market color was slightly stronger. Du Yangjian rice did not fluctuate much, and Yin Bianyuan rice also showed potential.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Twenty-six or seven ships arrived from various routes. The outflow of various goods on the market was normal. White japonica, white yuan, foreign Du Port Jian, and early thin rice prices were flat and weak. Except for a small premium on Yin Yuan rice.</p>
<h3>Guest Xian Rice Continues to Rise by 67 Points</h3>
<p>Guangdong Province Resells Xiangjing Rice</p>

<p>The Fujian traders' white Shanghai-Fujian shipping resumed, purchasing but the market there was furthermore, both were again shouting higher prices, unable to purchase, Fuzhou traders also came to the market yesterday to inquire, because their daily ships are open, probably there will be purchasing.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in addition to purchasing various xian rice, the local traders also repurchased 1,000 packages of machine-processed Jing rice from Yufeng Company of the Bang traders at a price of only $6.02. This price is cheaper than the market price because the rice was originally directly processed and packaged by the Guangdong provincial government in Hunan province. After being packaged in Guangdong, it did not suit the local market, so it was returned to Shanghai for sale, resulting in a slightly lower market price, which the local traders jointly purchased, it is said.</p>

<h3>Overview of Daily Necessities Market (3) Xinan</h3>
<p>Too much has been said about vegetarian food, and it still hasn't been thoroughly explained. People might suspect that I'm promoting vegetarian restaurants. That's not right. However, coming back to the point, those who open vegetarian restaurants are all vegetarians and believers in Buddhism. However, when we go to vegetarian restaurants, we can't say that it's sincere. It's a common problem with various food shops, but they still "bully newcomers." If we ask a few great lay Buddhists, such as Mr. Wang, Huang, Xu, or Qu, perhaps it's by chance, but the dishes they eat seem to be a bit more special than usual. This is not surprising. Old customers should be treated better than new customers who come once or twice. However, since vegetarian restaurants are run by Buddhists, they should adhere to the principle of "Buddha's equality," without distinguishing between new and old, and treat everyone equally. Only then can they say that "meat-eaters are base," and vegetarians can truly eliminate "the view of self and others."</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity, I have a few more words to say, which is that vegetarian restaurants often use the names of meat dishes for their side dishes, adding the word "vegetarian" to distinguish them, such as vegetarian chicken, vegetarian duck, vegetarian ham, vegetarian smoked goose, and vegetarian shark fin. The intention of the people in the restaurant may be to attract meat-eaters to try them. But in my opinion, since one is wholeheartedly vegetarian, why not forget about meat? Why still use meat dish names for everything? Therefore, I remember a saying in the countryside that mocks vegetarians, saying that they "pretend to eat three Guan (vegetarian) and hope for sixteen." If vegetarian side dishes still use meat names, isn't that like "pretending to eat three Guan vegetarian"?</p>
<p>Let's turn our attention back to the food of the coolies. If one is a Buddhist, one should naturally recite "Amitabha Buddha," it's really too pitiful. However, I haven't seen people in the countryside, not even having a grain of rice bran to drink every day, bracing their chests and drinking the northwest wind. Compared to the coolies in Shanghai, they can be said to be in heaven, while the former are truly in a hungry hell. Sometimes, after eating, we go out for a walk on the road and often see young San, seeing the food carriers coming and going, carrying leftover food and scraps, and they all rush forward, without asking why, and dump all the vegetables and leftover rice in their dirty lead buckets and iron cans. After they get so much food, of course, they will offer it to the old San, and in addition to feeding themselves, they still have to sell the leftovers. Sometimes, walking past Mofang Street, you can see this situation. Moreover, Mofang Street has even opened several restaurants for this purpose, which can be said to be "coolie restaurants." The small dishes that these restaurants can sell are probably the things that everyone doesn't want to buy in the small dish market, as well as the leftovers and scraps from the guests of various restaurants, a hodgepodge of "Eight Treasures Harmony Dish" (this is the name I gave it). In addition, on the sidewalks of the Republic Road, there are also many "temporary cafeterias" for coolies. Also, at all rickshaw parking lots, there are Jiangbei women, one hand carrying a large white lead water jug, and the other hand carrying a bucket (or basket) of food. The water jug is filled with boiling water (or tea), and the bucket is filled with pancakes, fried dough sticks, and the like. The rickshaw pullers hold a pancake in one hand and a water bowl in the other, sitting on the rickshaw frame, eating to fill their stomachs after catching their breath. If a guest hires a rickshaw, they chew a few bites, pull the rickshaw, and run desperately. Where else is there a chance to chew?</p>
<p>Shanghai has already reached the point where it only pays attention to eating and playing. Every morning, you can see people dumping "dog food bowls," full buckets and loads, being carried out from various alleys. Inside, there is a lot of white rice, which is taken to feed pigs. Especially in many families, the maids and elder sisters often forget their original appearance when they come to the city and dump the leftover vegetables and rice from the day into the dog food bowls. They no longer think that a grain of rice from the field to your belly can be said to be full of hardships and not easy. I remember that a certain book recorded that when a certain prime minister was in power, the leftover rice and dregs were all discarded in the ditch and flowed out with the water. A certain monk saw this and couldn't bear it, so he picked it up from the ditch, washed it clean, trampled it dry, and used it as food, and there was still a lot left over. Later, the prime minister failed due to something, and his fields and houses were all confiscated by the government. He stayed in a monastery to eat. The monk still used the collected and stored things as food. The prime minister ate it with relish and asked where it came from. The monk told him the truth, and the prime minister was moved. Therefore, I think that if people in Shanghai think of the prime minister's end, eating what he used to discard with relish, the same person, the difference before and after is so great, they should also cherish food a little.

<h3>Effeminate Men of Letters</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Since ancient times, men of letters have mostly been physically weak. There are very few who "lay down their pens and join the army" to become valiant warriors. Therefore, in the eyes of heroes and brave men, men of letters are "like women," and the wise and foolish emperors often have so-called dwarfs who sing and dance for entertainment. These dwarfs are men of letters. Later, actors and court musicians, generation after generation, had talented individuals, but in reality, they had become cultural slaves, equivalent to the ladies of the inner palace. However, although Confucius recruited students and taught them, he was not really a man of letters. In addition to the classics, rituals, music, and archery, he also taught riding and archery. His student Zilu learned "eighteen martial arts" and was known for his bravery. When the Duke of Lu went to Ying to meet the Duke of Qi, Confucius even brandished his sword and stepped forward to protect him, shaking the world with his prestige. Later, from the Qin to the Han dynasties, "emphasizing literature and neglecting military affairs," men of letters became widespread throughout the world, only knowing how to wield their pens, not knowing how to use guns and swords. In the Tang Dynasty, Li Shimin selected a group of men of letters from the Hanlin Academy to form an opera troupe. The men of letters in the Pear Garden were equivalent to actors and court musicians. At this time, it was most fashionable for men of letters to be "like women." Therefore, men of letters have been effeminate since ancient times, and there is historical evidence to support this. "It has been like this since ancient times."</p>
<p>A Tianjin newspaper reported that the manager of the Cultural Bookstore in Neijiang, Sichuan, named Chuan Yunlian, is about forty years old, has studied in Japan, and has served as a middle school principal and teacher. He is knowledgeable and has the demeanor of a famous scholar. In recent years, he has dressed in women's clothing, applied powder and rouge, and dresses as a woman both at home and outside. The people of the whole city say that he is a "freak." I think that Mr. Fu, this "man of letters" from Sichuan, is "knowledgeable" and has "the demeanor of a famous scholar," probably because he is pained by the decline of the world and mourns the demise of the Three Ways. He is demonstrating in person, following the ancients. Those who say he is a "freak" are simply reactionary elements who are destroying cultural revival movements. In today's world, as long as the political, academic, and moral standards are the "national essence that has existed since ancient times," there is support from above and below, cultural revival is underway, and the country's prosperity and strength can be expected soon. Mr. Fu's "dressing in women's clothing and applying powder and rouge" also belongs to the "national essence and morality that has existed since ancient times" and should be commended to set an example, which is the way to love the country. Moreover, some people advocate that "this Mr. Fu, who wishes to be born as a woman, is quite worthy of emulation." The reason given is that "our country has the most men of letters, and throughout history, every instance of dynastic rise and fall has had self-proclaimed men of letters stirring things up, harming the common people. It is difficult to write about it all. If the men of letters of today all acted like Mr. Fu, putting on airs and applying powder and rouge, and could all become graceful and effeminate like Mr. Fu, then there would be no ambitious people or diehards who spread rumors or confuse the public and distort right and wrong. Everything would be stable and peaceful without the need for control." This makes the great undertaking of feminizing men of letters seem even more urgent.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Righteous Servant and the Treacherous Friend"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Day of Reckoning</p>
<p>Generally speaking, ethical dramas easily evoke deep emotions in people. This is because everyone has a profound understanding of the relationships between fathers and sons, husbands and wives. Therefore, when comparing the emotions in the film with their own experiences, they often feel a sense of genuineness, assuming the author is truly rich in emotions.</p>
<p>In China, the [Humanitarianism] of "Humanity" (Rendao) can attract a huge audience, which is a clear example.</p>
<p>We sincerely say that the author of [Humanity] only presented outdated concepts in [Humanity], and [new interpersonal relationships] were not seen in [The Light of Motherhood]. Similarly, the author of [The Righteous Servant and the Treacherous Friend] only used extremely outdated understandings to deal with love and friendship, and even praised servants for their loyalty to their masters.</p>
<p>John Tam is imprisoned for debt and sentenced to two years in prison. His wife seeks help from her husband's friend, Holmes, due to the difficulty of supporting her husband and her livelihood. Holmes, driven by lust, secretly arranges for John Tam to be imprisoned and then seizes his wife. At this time, only the Tam family's maid does her best to take care of her two young masters. Soon, Tam's wife falls in love with Holmes and is shot to death by Holmes' other mistress. Holmes is also imprisoned. In prison, friends become enemies, and Tam eventually puts Holmes to death. After Tam is released from prison, he deeply thanks the maid.</p>
<p>The themes we explore in this story are: a wife who cannot share adversity and is unfaithful should die; one who commits adultery with a friend's wife should also die; and a loyal husband, even in danger, should be saved. As for loyal servants, they should naturally have a good outcome. The author is trying to maintain the existence of old moral ethics, especially by adopting the method of karmic retribution to end the lives of each character in the play, which feels even more fragile and mediocre.</p>
<p>From a new perspective, economic circumstances dictate everyone's behavior. Adultery with a friend's wife cannot be resolved by morality alone. In particular, a wife's weakening awareness due to life's hardships and her transfer of affection to another man is not a particularly serious crime. As for writing about the maid doing her best to support the master's children, it evokes a sense of alienation.</p>
<p>I think the most brilliant part of the author's treatment of this story is the sincerity of friendship in prison used to resemble Holmes, which is a relatively appropriate method.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the director's biggest lack is insufficient emotion. In some cases, we are against unnecessary sentimentality, but the director, Charles R. Brabin, has not emphasized the emotional component under such an outdated theme, which shows that his creativity is indeed insufficient.</p>
<p>In addition, the director is clear and smooth in organizing the story. What is more commendable is that he does not excessively exaggerate Holmes' ugliness. He allows the other characters to develop naturally. No, to be precise, he does not write about the so-called bad being excessively bad, nor does he make the so-called good excessively sympathetic. This naturally does not use dramatic exaggeration; otherwise, the exaggeration will strengthen the poison of old ideas. Saying this seems to be the benefit of insufficient performance methods. A smile.</p>
<p>There are several scenes that should be specifically pointed out. When John Tam sees his child through the prison window, he cries out in sorrow and joy: "He can already walk, he already..." In addition, when John Tam learns of his friend's shamelessness in prison, he exclaims, "He is my friend!..." followed by mad laughter. All of this is where the director excels.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Richard Dix, did indeed perform very well in the above two scenes. However, that is his only merit, and the rest is very mediocre. Among the supporting actors, none are particularly lovable, but Una Marke, who plays the maid, is relatively natural.</p>
<p>Regarding Richard Dix, he does not seem to be frequently seen by Chinese audiences. As far as I know, he starred in many films, including [The Sin Flood], [Glorious Fool], [Souls for Sale], [The Price of Glory], [The Ten Commandments], [Happiness Ahead], [Man Must Live], [The Christian], [Nothing to Lose], [The Sporting Lover], [Young Nowheres], [The Great Divide], etc. Many of them have not come to China. [The Ten Commandments] left the deepest impression.</p>
<p>Regarding this film, if I were to write a few general comments, it should be that it is neither good nor bad, a film at the level of old-fashioned works.</p>
<h3>New Film Production at Lianhua Third Factory</h3>
<p>[Return] (Gui Lai), written and directed by Zhu Shilin of Lianhua Third Factory, was shown at the Capital Cinema in Nanjing, where it was full every day and received excellent reviews. Now, this film has been acquired by the newly built Jincheng Grand Theater in Shanghai for its Shanghai premiere. The new film produced by the factory after [Return] is [A Beautiful Night] (Liang Xiao), written by Zhu Shilin and directed by Yang Xiaozhong. At the same time, in order to increase production and meet social needs, two comedies are being filmed. One is [Seeking a Spouse] (Zheng Hun), starring the fat Yin Xiucen, and the other is a script written by Shen Aijuan, tentatively named [Street People] (Jie Tou Ren), a collaboration between Liu Jiqun and Han Langan. [Seeking a Spouse] is light and clever, and quite interesting. [Street People] is a tear-stained comedy. The characters in the play are two wanderers, an orphan, and a grandmother who makes a living by doing laundry, as well as a landlord and the landlord's maid. Because these two comedies are extraordinary, they are special productions of the Third Factory and will create a new record for domestic comedy films.</p>
<h3>Director Sun's Selection of New Talents</h3>
<p>It is undeniable that the Chinese film industry lacks talent in all aspects. Lianhua is the company that pays the most attention to cultivating new talents, and Sun Yu is the first person in Lianhua to particularly work hard to select talents. In his recent work, [Sports Queen] (Tiyu Huanghou), he scouted Zhang, who had been stuck in a small company for a long time, as the male lead. For the female leads, he gave Wang Moqiu and Wang superior positions so that they could develop their talents. He also selected two female actors, Yin Xu and Bai Lu, who had never been on camera before. Although these two new talents had never been on camera, their innate acting talents were instructed and enlightened by the director, and their brilliance began to show. The impression left on the film is very good. According to Director Sun, they will definitely be a sensation. Although it is not an exaggerated praise of some kind of new discovery, it is undoubtedly that they will gain a superior position among actors in the Chinese film industry in 1934. Let's wait and see.</p>
<h3>Fat Yin Xiucen Wins First Prize</h3>
<p>During the sale of aviation lottery tickets, almost everyone had to buy at least one strip. It doesn't cost much, but there is a chance to get rich and help with aviation construction. Why not do it? Therefore, the sales of lottery tickets are very enthusiastic every period. The colleagues at Lianhua, of course, have to buy them too. When the third period was drawn, although some only got the last digit of the first prize, everyone was not disappointed but smiled happily.</p>
<p>A few days after the drawing, Yin the Fat hurried to the first factory. But he ran over in a hurry, and when he talked to Fei Mu, he secretly fumbled around as if he had a secret. Soon, the news that Yin Xiucen had won the first prize spread. Of course, everyone wanted to see his lottery ticket, and immediately everyone looked at him with special eyes and asked him to treat them, but he did not admit it. But finally, everyone saw his lottery ticket. Indeed, it was 313817. When people surrounded him and asked him to treat them, he burst out laughing. It turned out that he had cut and pasted the numbers of this first prize from lottery tickets next to him. Everyone looked closely and realized that they had indeed been fooled by the fat man.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>The Cat and the Fiddle (9)</h3>
<p>— Mo Chen</p>
<p>Victor said in dismay, "If you don't let your wife go on stage, won't the show be a disaster?" Odette's husband said, "Show? It's over." He turned back to Odette and said, "How is it? Have you thought about it? But you have to know that no matter what you want, I will never invest in that show again." Odette looked embarrassed. She thought that if her husband didn't pay, the show wouldn't succeed. She really wanted to return to the stage and enjoy the glory of success, but if she failed, what would there be to enjoy? So, this Odette, who was used to comfort and luxury, had to surrender. She said to her husband, "What's wrong, my love? Of course, I'll go with you."</p>
<p>Victor watched them leave. Money is omnipotent. The old man was even more confident in his boundless power, because at this time Odette had already taken his arm, leaning tightly against him, her beautiful face turned up to him with a charming smile. After they left, Victor felt that his success had disappeared like a dream, and with it the hope of winning Sherry. After a while, he suddenly mustered his courage again and decided to fight to the end. He gathered all the actors and rehearsed again. He instructed his assistant to immediately find a female lead, telling him to search all of Paris and find her, because his operetta must be performed tomorrow!</p>
<p>By the next morning, the whole city of Paris was talking about this as a new joke. And someone told Sherry about it, and told her that not only had the female lead left, but the male lead had also run away. Therefore, he is now doing the male lead himself and needs to find another female lead. And since Odette's husband is unwilling to pay any more money, the show will have no hope of success. Also, the theater side... The theater owner was originally going to guarantee it. Victor gave him a promissory note. So, if Victor's show fails, he will not be able to cash that promissory note, and he will have to go to jail. Therefore, his current situation is really very dangerous. After Sherry heard this, she said coldly, "That's none of my business. I really don't want to hear about Victor anymore." After the guest left, Sherry ran around the room alone, really worried about Victor. Then she realized that she still loved him... even more than before.</p>
<p>The curtain is about to rise. The Cat and the Fiddle is about to take the stage. Behind the curtain, a large group of actors huddled together. Victor was also squeezed in with them. The newly found female lead stared at him with tears in her eyes. She said, "In the past, I could perform as I pleased. Now I am old. Do you think a grandmother can still go on stage and play a young girl?" Victor patted her on the shoulder, comforting her and saying, "My love, it doesn't matter, you will definitely perform very well, don't worry." Although he said so, his heart was already half cold. He thought of the mockery of him all over Paris tomorrow... everyone mentioning his name, his operetta, and his ridiculous female lead... tomorrow... he smiled coldly with his mouth twisted... tomorrow, wouldn't he already be locked up in jail because he couldn't cash that check? But time did not allow him to think deeply alone, his program had arrived, and he had to go on stage, and he had to perform well... (To be continued)</p>
