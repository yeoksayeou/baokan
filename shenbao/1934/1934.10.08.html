<p>以市面不佳。隨農村之破敗而同進。此種形勢固不易以人工救濟。惟絲業方面。亦自有不可隱飾之弱點。就絲之本身論。一般人批評以爲絲織品不耐久又易污濁。伸縮性極小。保温力亦不及毛織品。斯言固亦未嘗無理由。　　然而絲織品實有特殊優良之點在。（一）絲綢衣着。光潔耐久。（二）存貯時不畏虫蛀。惟以價格太高。當此一般經濟極度窮乏之時。自難與低廉之棉織品較短長。而所最爲可慮者。外貨輸入日多。隨時隨地。皆爲市塲競爭之勁敵。人造　絲織物。工技愈精進。價格之廉。幾與棉織品相等。形式又足與眞絲競賽。在此情勢之下。而不加改良。則絲業前途。實甚可危。至於改良之道。欲與棉織品爭因。固不可能。然至少必須以毛織品爲對象。而求其所以制勝之道。</p>
<p>絲織品所以不能與毛織品競爭者。都以爲質地細薄。服用上不能製西裝。亦不宜於製軍服。現在改良牛絲及絲織品。不特應着眼於高级物品。與婦女　裝。尤須研究如何可以絲織品代替毛織品。推廣一般用途。以確立國内市塲之基礎。同時設法向海外發展。如能織造質地堅厚之綢類。縱提高價格至　時市價一倍以上。當亦不愁無消路。蓋經久耐穿。可與毛織物比美也。至保温一層。確爲無法改良之實際問題。然吾人素知絲棉温暖。較毛織物並無不及。惟因質軟製衣欠平整。伸縮過大。似不適於短裝。設使能善用近代科學方法。加以恰當之壓力。想亦可免擁腫之弊則冬季用絲棉。輕暖自勝於皮毛也。再則改革絲绒。亦屬一法。現在絲織品之改進確甚努力。出品亦頗精良。惟目光似僅注射於美觀。而忽略於實用性。如轉換以往觀念。捨美觀而以厚實耐　久爲第一義。則絲絨代用厚呢。未始不能普及於全國。總之。改良絲業。一面應自絲織品本身着眼。一而尤須集合絲業全體之力。加以國家之輔助則難關不難穩渡也。</p>

<p>申報流通圖書館讀書指導部編</p>
<p>目錄　（一）停刊［讀書問答］啟事</p>
<p>（二）特載</p>
<p>一、讀書生活消息</p>
<p>二、靑年會讀書會消息</p>
<p>停刊［讀書問答］啟事</p>
<p>時光過得眞快，［讀書問答］與諸君見面已整整的九個月了。除開舊歷年關，和偶然因爲本報篇幅不够的關係停過不上十次的刊以外，天天都有整萬讀者在閲讀它。我們非常的榮幸，我們在精神上獲得了如此多數的同情者，但在另一方面，我們不能不感覺慚愧了。</p>
<p>我們到底給了一些什麽與讀者了呢。在這停刊的前夜，我們確事的反省了一回。我們在此臨别之前，不能不有一番自白，我們不能不承認我們给與别人的東西，如果不是零，那也是太有限了。</p>
<p>這决不是謙虚的話。第一，因爲［讀書問答］本不過是本部工作的一部分，同時本部本部本身也不過是圖書館的一部門，我們没有更充足的時間來把［讀書問答］弄得更有聲色，更合實際。第二，因爲本報篇幅的關係，新聞稿件常常撫擠不堪，對於一篇貧　的［讀書問答］，常常不得不截成幾段，使讀的人前後不相關聯，讀了等於不讀，第三，因爲寫讀書問答的人，大槪都是幾個書獃子，與店員學徒的實際生活，隔得太遠，所寫出的東西，不能不仍是帶着書生的氣氛，不能使眞正没有敎養的人去接近它。第四，我們也還受着許多方面善意的責難，嚴正的糾正，强勉　棉力，想做到超然，　在心勞日拙，不能不負大家的期望。總之，反躬自問，除慚愧外，祇有自責。現在我們是不想再繼續做這種我們不能做的工作了。敬向關心我們的一切人士致謝並告罪。</p>
<p>今後呢？我們本是圖書館的工作者，對於館中的讀書指導的工作並不因此而終·反之，我們更可集中精力在其他方面。同時還可附筆告慰讀書，讀書生活不久將出版一種讀書雜名誌呌讀書生活半月刊以後凡關於讀書的問題，或者該刊也要談到的，現在我們把這一報角暂時取銷，大致不會怎樣感覺寂寞罷！</p>
<p>前後，我們萬分希望讀者隨時在生活中去攝取新的知諓，今日的中國，定在一個非常豐富的時代中，祇要自已忠於生活，勤於攝取，誠無往而不可獲的知識，我們勸諸君用讀書，但同時不要太相信書，勸諸君有一分鐘時光就在大街閙市中去翻閲，不要回到明窗淨几的書齋中去。並祝大家珍重。</p>

<p>一，讀書生活改歸讀書生活社主編上海</p>
<p>雜志公司發行</p>

<p>二，　［讀書生活］徴稿。</p>
<p>［讀書生活］内客已於本刊二七期公佈，大致並無變更，該刊特别注意各社會局的讀者生活的調查，所以特别要求各色店員，學徒，工人，士兵，農民及一切職業生活者，平日不寫文章的人，供給［生活記錄］的稿件。凡能冩字的讀者無論文字通與不通，只要能將你的特殊生活實况寄給該刊，該刊一槪歡迎，不能運用文字的人，如願意將自已的生活告人，祇要函約該刊並可派出記者代爲筆錄。但此項生活記錄，不要一句閑話，每篇字數至長不得過三千字。同時，還歡迎將各種生活忙迫的人［自學經騐談］，［讀書筆記］等，但每篇以一千五百字爲限。來稿請寄上海四馬路三零號上海雜誌公司，讀書生活社收。</p>
<p>二，靑年會讀書會消息</p>
<p>靑年會讀書會第二期於本月七日在八仙橋開成立會。到會員一百五十餘人，本市敎育局長潘公展先生親自蒞會指導。九時開會如儀，由李公檏先生主席。潘局長演说，大致包括，讀書人應了解讀書的目的，應了解靑年會辦理讀書會的目的，讀書的態度，人生觀等，議論在精彩。演辭全文收刊於青年會刊，繼有高級班代表楊立均及初級班代表王文清演说。演说畢，即舉行分班。計分高級班，初級班二。開會時閒仍定星期四下午七時半至九時半，星期日上午九時半至十一時半地址在八仙橋靑年會。聞該會會員缺額尚多，歡迎讀書有興趣的人參加，加入手續可直接向八仙橋青年會函索。</p>

<p>形勢懸殊優游如終居上</p>
<p>最後一刻猶太連失五球</p>
<p>西聯足球甲组聯賽、昨爲中西隊相逢之第一次、優游遇猶太於申園、優游於陣容刷新之後、實力頓厚、果然以七比二之鉅數、痛擊新入甲組之猶太隊、上半時猶太曾憑其一股鋭氣、頑强拒抗、打成一比一平手、但優游終以二比一佔先、下半時於三比二後、優游竟連中五球、猶太卒因此潰不成軍、以七比二大敗、觀者五六千人、歡天喜地而歸、</p>
<p>猶太技術究屬幼稚</p>
<p>優游昨日對付</p>
<p>猶太、可稱游</p>
<p>刃有餘、始終</p>
<p>佔居上風、打門可中、指不勝屈、不計其數、但有因合作欠佳、聯連未熟、不能彼此呼應、以致坐失良機不可計、脚頭之見凖、最爲憾事、能打門者孫錦顺羅海光而已、鍾育祥根本不能打門、左翼雖有若無、優游後防尚可、李惠明尚可靠、雲　逢　特列賣力、鍾勇森雖滿塲飛奔、前锋實感不平均也、至於猶太徒有其勇、技術究尚幼稚、前鋒左翼、稍有危險性、</p>

<p>戰幕旣啟、優</p>
<p>游開球、猶太</p>
<p>人人拚命、個</p>
<p>個咬牙數度、猛擈優游防地、李惠官指揮若定、佐雲梁二將、抵死鎭守在關、故無若何差池、不久小雲得罰球機會、　送與南島球星鍾育祥、高而飛返身待搶、鍾氏機警、趕緊挑送中央、孫錦順以迅雷不及掩耳这手段、不等來球落地、發腿猛射、狄列克抵擋不得、遂失一球</p>

<p>猶太受此重創</p>
<p>那堪忍耐、乃</p>
<p>力謀報復、皮</p>
<p>令基身先士卒引兵西渡、殊不料爲李惠官半渡王擊而無功、傍却克贼頭賊腦、混進優游禁地、邀梁兩骑飛來、傍氏急切、尸送交Ｌ格林勃、格林勃如飛前進、砰然一聲造成和局、羅海光見事危殆、率師東下、獨踹番營、逼成角球、梁樹棠開去、恰到好處、羅海光兜頭一頂以二對一、終上半時、</p>

<p>之雄心、進攻</p>
<p>退守、小心翼翼、十分鐘竟無紀錄發現、俄敵右路先鋒、邊陲進製、聲勢洶洶、内防空虚、楊銘金孤立無援、觀衆莫不代爲擔愁、幸王樹森從半路中衝出、化險爲夷、孫錦順盤到好處、轉讓小羅、立一大功、三分鐘後小雲在罰球區内悔不該以手吻球、造成十二碼刑事、亨斯　刀不老、一試成功、</p>

<p>潘局長演詞云、今天來參加讀書會第二期開學儀式、很覺高興、當初讀書會的主持人曾徴求兄弟意見、我就認爲這是很重要的一個組織、社會需要有這種文化工作、因爲學校裏面的課程與時間、都太固定、不能活動、如要使一般人有求學上進的機會、必須在學校以外想補救辦法、像圖書館·博物院、皆是補助學校敎育之不足、現靑年會所辦之讀書會、亦復同此用意、諸位利用空閑時間、來此研究學問、比做無聊的事、旣費時間、又耗精神高貴得多、如看了一本書、總増加些智識、這不但於個人有好處、即社會國家、亦無形得其利益、所以我們無論從那方面看、都要贊助讀書會、並且希望不但今年靑年會辦、明年還是辦、别的地方也起來辦、將來東也有讀書會、西也有讀書會、像這樣讀書的事業、能一天一天的發達起來、擴大起來、</p>

<p>一、設立世界的和平委員會、以求聯絡各國的敎育團體、並恊調爲實現和平而設立的世界各國的團體、以及调查研究從敎育上實現世界和平的有效適切的方法二、調查世界上歷史敎授現狀的委員會、三、關於國際運動競技的委員會、四關於調停機關的委員會、五軍事敎育調查委員會、六戰爭不可避免論調查委員會、七、設立調查海牙法庭及國際司法裁判所對於世界敎育關係的委員會、各委員會將其調查的結果報告於聯合敎育會、聯合敎育會據此而建立有效適切的方策、</p>
<p>世界聨合敎育會在第一次愛丁堡會中採用此條、爲便利起見、將上列幾個委員會中的五個、附屬於哈曼儏爾登委員會、即第一部、和平敎育部、第二部、歷史敎育部、第三部、國際運動競技部、第四部、軍事敎育部、第五部、國際調停部、這委員會的各部會在每次會期中舉行、在以上的總會部會及哈曼儏爾登委員會的開會期間、世界各國的敎育者相聚一堂、舉行關於種種敎育問題的演講、調查研究結果的報告等、此外更舉行代表會議、</p>

<p>三、一九三五年的世界敎育會議與日本這次世界敎育會議將在日本開會、日本敎育人士認爲這次大會對於日本非常時期偉大的開拓有至大的關係、這可以由幾方面來説明、就國際關係上面言、日本自從［九一八］以來、冒天下之大不諱、抛撇了歷來親善的假面具、顯露其猙獰的本相、悍然地强佔東三省、破壞世界和平、毀棄了九國公約、並且又於［一二八］戰爭在繁盛</p>

<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>我不是胸境狹隘的人，但我看到那些高鼻綠眼黄髮的人們的傲慢驕横的態度，心理上總有些不舒服。我常想他們除開高鼻綠眼黄髮以外，有什麽好驕傲的地方呢？剝去了拿來擺出他們紳士架子的衣服，他們原是個毛毶毶的人，就人種演進的程度上説：他們至少比中國人落後二千年。丢開這些紳士不論，再等而下之，到中國來的水兵，我們常可以看到他們身上刺着觸目的花紋丨有些刺的是鐵錨，有些刺的是男女擁抱丨這又與中國的刺花黨身上刺的花並無差别。如果［文身］，是野蠻人的遺俗，這自視爲最文明的人又何來野蠻的遺俗呢？　　　從人類學的見地來看，我們要知道一個民族無論她的文化如何進步，在她的文化特質中，仍有不少原始時代的蠻性的遺留，目光稍遠大，態度較公正的人，决不會因某民族文化中有某種蠻性的遺留。而遂否定某民族整個的文化。然而到東方來的白種人則不然，他們態度的偏激見解的幼稚，眞使人看到就討厭。他們總以爲他們是上帝選擇的兒子，他們的文化也是最優越的。他們只要一看出中國某種文化特質與他們兩樣，就認爲這眞神秘，或這眞太野蠻了。</p>
<p>卽就吃一項來講，你和一個白種人接觸較久，他就會帶着好奇而經蔑的口吻來問你：［中國人吃老鼠同蛇？有這會事嗎］？你如果是閩粤人你回答有：那末他簡直如發現奇跡一般，認爲這是不可思議的事丨你如果不是閩粤人，你回答他［我不知道，至少我是不吃有的］，那末他簡直當你是個萹子，有意瞞藏你國内的秘密。蛇鼠的味道究竟如何，是否可以吃或不可以吃，這問題我們不必去討論，閩粤人的吃蛇鼠，卽算奇怪，歐洲人的吃蝸牛，在我們東方人看來，亦何嘗不奇怪呢？</p>
<p>吃的文化，中國原有其地位，已有定論，自不能一槪抹煞。我記得從前有一個朋友曾告訴我下面的一件事（這件事眞實性，是無疑問的，也許加上幾分渲染的是不免的）幾年前有某大學幾個學生同往德國留學，船大槪到了印度洋上的時候，剛逢中秋，幾位留學生因爲西菜吃膩了，他們要吃中國菜，於是去同廚房商量，呌留出一份生的鷄魚肉菜讓他們自已燒，他們按照中國菜的燒法把菜燒好，顏色鮮紅，味道亦極好，船上的外國廚司大加讚賞。幾位留學生爲使外國人曉得中國菜的美味，特别留下幾樣，給廚司們吃。一位肥胖膿腫的廚司頭兒，那時小病剛好，一看到這樣顏色好的鷄肴，順手撕開一塊鷄來嘗嘗，發現中國菜，另有一番風味，他就吩咐其他下手不准動，讓他一人獨享。他並開了幾瓶酒助興，等到他旣醉且飽爬上一張高高床舖安睡後，不知他醉得十分糊塗呢，還是不小心，忽然一交從床舖上重重跌下來，跌斷了，肚腸不久就此一命嗚呼。</p>
<p>這位廚司頭兒的跌死，可以相當證明中國菜魔力之大。中國至少在吃的方面還不輸於人，然而偏有許多高鼻綠眼黄髮的人，要閙别扭。我記得前二年有一個法國新聞記者曾在外國著名某雜誌上，發表文章説：他在北平有一次中國人請客，他到菜館他覺得房屋太舊朽，杯箸太不明潔，中國人的混食，也不合他們的習慣，鯊魚的翅，照他想來，也無什麽味道可言，於是他覺得中國菜一無可吃，就借題發揮，大駡中國人一頓，這種頭朝着大，信口亂開河，［放屁放屁眞正豈有此理］的驕横態度。類乎這樣的事，又豈獨這一件。</p>
<p>在歐洲跑過的人，總覺得在巴黎柏林的碧眼兒，並不是像這批來東方的人態度可惡。其實來中國這批人的態度可惡，恐怕中國人也養成一半，買辦洋奴們的逢迎，固然足以使他們覺得突然升高了一級。此外上海的所謂高等華人歡迎一個莫名其妙的外國人，以特别隆重的禮節，也是其原因之一，有一個朋友從美國回來，他曾親自聽見一個美國人對他説：［在中國的白人眞是上帝呀！］這是一方面表示白人們的得意，一方面也可以看出白人的所以這樣驕傲，中國人自身亦難免其咎呀。</p>
<h3 id="c180">秋天 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 英子</p>
<p>悄悄地，拾起給秋風帶落的病葉，抛進荼爐去；望着那一星熊熊的火光，就永遠都懷了一種等待的心情似地，我煮着茶希望能够來一位遠客和自已品茗清談。……</p>
<p>因爲有了三分病、也就有了七成閒了。</p>
<p>而這樣蕭散的日子是不大容易有的。人，大槪總歡喜有一點閑逸的趣緻的吧？雖然不免清聊聊地，可是靜泰一些，對於一顆給生活踐踏得倦沉了的心，畢竟是有着好感的。</p>
<p>爲了貪圖後院裏幾樹梧桐的飘逸瀟灑，和處地僻靜，就帶了一付茶具，獨自遷到這兒的小書齋來住下了。同時自已却也甘心寂寂地處在齋中玩味着這難得的靜趣。</p>
<p>［梧月·松風·蕉雨　　茶爐·琴韵·書聲］</p>
<p>偶而從茶葉罐上看到這樣的兩句東西，覺着頗與自家此日情景相似，就央人去倩一位書家寫了來補壁，灰暗的壁上是已經有了好多的白色的壁蟢窠點綴着了。</p>
<p>每天，我便在這樣的塲合裏，用等待的心情寗靜地烹一壺茶。······</p>
<p>時間，也就掛在蝸牛尾上似地，那麽迁緩地，使人覺着不易消磨丨丨一個病閒的人大槪總都經歷過這種感覺的吧？</p>
<p>尤其，是這種境地使人感到非常的空廓。</p>
<p>秋風蕭蕭地從梧桐葉上飄起來了，牕外，是一簾靜靜的日影·風過處，萬籟俱寂，這在我聽來眞是一些些難耐的寂寞·</p>
<p>『記得小樓，</p>
<p>聽一夜江南春雨，</p>
<p>夢醒蕭聲，</p>
<p>流水靑蘋，</p>
<p>舊遊何許？』</p>
<p>在恬靜閒適的環境裏默默地誦着詞人張玉田底句子的時候，就眞不知此時身在何所了。於是，在晴窗下，焚起一爐好香來吟味着［傳奇］或［彈詞］的日子是常常有的。悠悠地，望着那一縷上冒的裊裊的靑烟，自已就會把整個心神都沉浸到那些［傳奇］中的綺麗的兒女私情的故事中去。······</p>
<p>這時，破寂的，就只有寥寥的爐間茶響。</p>
<p>而這些單純的簡檏的聲調，是更能加濃周遭的空氣寂靜的·在這樣的時候，我常是冥心物外，覺得什麽都没有得説的了。</p>
<h3 id="c181">關於命數字 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>我所提出的問題，是現行的命數法太累贅，該怎樣改革？我知道有人曾擬出改革的辦法過</p>
<p>，但仍然不十分便當，因此我覺得最好另造新字，想過好久，似乎　四種造注都可以，特寫出來供大家研究，如果能認爲有一式可用，固所深喜，就全要不得，路也總是一條。下面是我擬的新命數字表··</p>
<p>現行式　个　十　百　千　万　十万　百万　十万万　百万万　千万万万　一百万万万万</p>
<p>新擬字　（讀兆）　（　密）　（讀蒂）　（讀屈）</p>
<p>甲式（从十）　·　·　·千（或斗）·</p>
<p>乙式（从千）　·　·　·千·　··𠦅�</p>
<p>丙式（从万）　·　·　·　·　·　·</p>
<p>丁式（从兆）　·　·　·　·　·　億　兆　　　　　　　兆</p>
<p>現行式末項的百万万万万，顯然是誰也覺得不成話的，但還並非天文式的數字，而實是常用得到的，即英德文中的ＴrIHIon,統計上就可以用得到·我這裏所擬，也以到這一字爲止，但再大的也可類推，因所擬的字，都有一定法則。</p>
<p>甲式是西洋科學上的ＩＸＯＮ變來的，因原法讀音不便，而且與普通三位一進的觀念不諧，所以改爲中國式的字，並只了取三進數·本來該可以直接用ＫＯ等，但似不像中國字，恐難通行·這甲式私意以爲最直接。</p>
<p>乙式純就三進（千的方乘）着想，似最便書寫。</p>
<p>丙式牽就萬進，雖已略簡單，仍見累　。</p>
<p>丁式可説是西洋命數法的翻譯。兆字在曾行過的舊萬進法上爲十萬萬萬，不曾怎樣通行，所以仍無礙其作原來十進法中的百萬；而且四百兆（四萬萬）同胞這句話很流行，有助於他的凖確·這兆正當於西文的丨Ｌiono我没有考過丨Ｌion這字的字源，望文生義，似是代表一千乘一千之數，故ＭiIIion爲一個(MI)一千乘一千BiIIion爲Lion的自乘（英德式法美不同ＹＴir</p>
<p>Hion爲Lion三乘方·丁式中就造了兩個與其相當的字·且因中文易併合，又造了兩個界於三數之中的字·再以上可類推，或只用兆進也無妨。</p>
<p>無論用那一式，讀音都擬作如上·兆是原有的，密取英德的MiIIiardo字的第一音，必取BiIHon第一音，屈取TriＩＩion,蒂則取千乘兆兆的千字變音或讀高夢旦所擬的　（？）也可以。</p>
<p>截取西字的音，或者有人答爲用夷變　，但我覺得數字最要緊是示出清楚的觀念，與其抬出已死的古字音，使人莫名所謂，不如就已爲中學生及以上的許多人所了解　西文意象，一使其貫通·至於何以截取一音，則一爲便利，二因原字的英美意義不同，不完全音譯，可避免混淆，三則米突稱米，打扔稱打，早有先例，而並無不便，自可倣傚。</p>
<p>科學家是最勇於造新字的，如氣　，腺　等字，都好而且便·現行算學，也　　釋的逈　，正也該造新字，我想這説法，至少科學家可不反對。</p>

<h3 id="c185">上海市學童肺癆病問題之重要（上） <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 李廷安</p>
<p>上海市學童肺癆病，非僅　於在校的學生，就是家庭裏的兒童也有關係，可分三點來講，在未講之前先介紹：</p>
<p>什麽是肺澇？</p>
<p>肺癆成因由於感受肺澇桿菌的侵製。假使我們有了肺癆病吐出來的痰血經過色手續，可檢查出許多的紅色桿狀蟲子，這些蟲子就呌做肺癆桿菌，　他侵入我們肺部，能够吃爛我們的肺，破壞血管，發生吐血現象。輕症患　者不自知覺，一如常人，以後溃爛漸大，毒素灡漫，以致面龐黄瘦，證重减輕，並常於下午發熱而體温增高，常人是三十七度，肺癆病患者則常增至三十七半至三十八度。小孩在此時甚易發怒。再潰爛則咳嗽，但次數不多，每咳一兩聲而已，情形厲害者吐血。虚瘦，出冷汗（不熱而出汗之謂）此時肺部潰爛愈大，患者就變成幾根瘦骨支成的一個［癆病鬼］了！這已經到了肺癆第三期的情形，甚難治愈。如經醫師檢查則肺部發現極不正當的局部症狀，用愛克司光射照可以見到破爛的地方，經細菌檢查便見到肺澇桿菌。肺癆病在早期很容易醫治，第一期還可治療，到了第三期就難有辦法，肺澇桿菌入腸生腸癆，入皮　則爲皮　癆，隨在可以生長，不過肺部是他最喜歡寄生的部分罷了。</p>
<p>肺癆的症狀通常均爲以上所述的發熱，咳嗽，出冷汗：但有的直接吐血不經過這些過程，那便是畸形的症狀。我國每年死於肺癆病者十萬人口中有四百百人之多，我國人口四萬萬用簡單的比例來算一算，每年總共要產生一百六十萬的［肺癆病鬼］！在淞滬戰役日本慘殺我若干同胞那不過是臨時性質，而肺癆病死亡却是年年有之，所以這個問題很値得研究。英國在百年前亦如我國，每年十萬人口中要有四百人患　肺癆病而死現在每年只死八十人，减少到五分之一，此卽表示公共衛生發達傳染病减少。這是要同諸位討論的第一點。</p>
<p>上海市學童肺癆的狀態</p>
<p>現在談到本題就是上海市學童肺癆狀態，上海市在去年成立中國防癆恊會提倡防癆工作，因爲我們學得這件事體很重要，而戰勝［肺癆病鬼］也是很有把握的，根據以往的經騐，各國都打了勝仗，我國當然不能例外。所以在開始後衛生敎育兩局就合作一個肺癆檢查英文名字呌做［杜白克林］試騐（TubercuIinTest)試騐方法就是將菌體晒乾，磨成粉末，和以鹽水，放在玻璃瓶内，用注射筒抽取少許，注射於皮下，隨卽漲成泡狀，過若干小時，無肺癆者不表現反應　，有肺癆病者局部甚紅，這是测騐我們有無肺癆病的方法。衛生局在去秋特請高镜朗博士在市立比德學校施行肺檢查，受檢學童計有八百二十二人，其中有五百四十二人有陽性反應，這就證明百分之六十以上有肺癆病。於是勸告這五百四十二人的家長到紅十字會醫院减費施照愛克司光。總計有一百二十九名願受檢查，結果送到醫院療治，重者三十三人，輕者五十七人，最輕者三十四人，諸位試看一百二十九名中已有五個最重的病人，三十三個重症的患者，照這個數目比例起來，如果五百四十二人均受檢查則可得最重者十五人，重者一百人。於此我們發現幾點値得硏究的問題：</p>
<p>一、患者本身　患重病的人仍然繼續讀書，將來多致死亡。所以敎員要注重在育而不應偏重於敎，從前重敎不重育不顧學生身體，結果對於健康方面很有影響。這與現在　局長的寓敎於育之意，大相逕庭。諸位先生化費了許我精神敎出一班學生，而不幸死去這很不値得　。所以希望能够本着潘局長敎與育合一的主張做去。以上講的是根據統計發現得肺癆病的第一點寗處是在危害學童個人的身體健康和學業進步。　　（未完）</p>
<p>安慶醫藥衛生槪况（二）</p>
<p>— 江晦鳴</p>
<p>（四）新舊醫之團體活動與學術研究</p>
<p>新醫界的分子，多受過國家高等敎育，當然對於團體的認識，很能十分清楚，安慶的新醫界，曾組織了懷寗縣醫師公會，會員約有五十人，主持社務的人，尚能精诚合一，對外的力量，也還十分雄厚。</p>
<p>舊醫在民初，卽有［中醫學會］設立，雖用了學術團體的名稱，但是仍有關於職業團體的工作。民國十九年，新醫提倡醫學革命的高潮澎湃着，全國中醫改稱國醫的聲浪，也喊得震天價響，安慶的中醫學會，便在那時期醖釀着改稱［國醫公會］，爲了舊醫份子、缺乏團體的認識，直到今春，　慢慢地難產出來，全體會員约在百人左右。可是組織的散漫，工作的弛懈，意見的龐雜，經費的支絀，毫無生氣可言。雖然有少數熱心會務的人，積極進行一切，俗云［獨木難支大厦］，却也無能爲力。</p>
<p>民國初年。安慶曾有官醫局的設立，由舊醫在裏面主持醫務。自從國民革命成功後，安徴的省政府，設立了救濟院，便將舊有官醫局，改稱施醫所，隷屬在救濟院下，這時候施醫所的内容，則不像以前，主持醫務的，由新醫和舊醫分担。</p>
<p>講到學術團體，在安慶很不多見。民國二十一年，曾由作者聯合當地醫學界知名之士如殷子正先生等，组織一］東方醫學研究社］，並先後在安慶［民國日報］，［新皖鐸報］，發刊［醫學創刊］，［醫學週刊］頗能喚起社會人士注意。其間，雖有懷寗縣醫師公會一度主編［醫學專刊］及健生醫院出版之［健生醫報］。可惜都限於人事變演，財力不充，終至曇花一現。至今追思，猶有餘痛！</p>

<p>出版者安慶皖報社</p>
<p>（五）安慶醫院之調查與作者之意見</p>
<p>新醫在安慶，發展至有今日，多頼安慶的新醫同志，努力掙扎的結果，的確的頗屬不易。安慶的風氣，在民初頗丕塞，往往新醫給病人施行注射的時候，眞有病有一見卽駭號而逃。現在呢，當然没有這樣的笑話了。不過，醫師數量的缺之，和醫師程度之參差，在那樣環境裏，却也是不許我們苛求。但是，作者有不能見諒於我安慶新醫同志的，深覺得安慶不符名實的醫院太多了。尤其是在最近幾年，新醫在安慶逢勃發展的過程中，醫院的勃興，也似雨後春笋，顧能實事求是組設诊所的，祇有程里鳴診所及杏林治療所，這究竟可是好現象呢？從國家頒行的管理醫院法規上看起來，不合的地方太多了。有志愛好新醫同志們，請注意名正言順的眞價値。不要漠視了今後新醫與社會的整個問題。</p>
<p>我以爲此後我們新醫在安慶開業，比較以设立專科診所爲適宜。因爲安慶太缺乏專家醫師了。我們要提高病家對新醫的信仰的打破新醫擅外科，舊醫長内科的論調，祇　有專門技術，纔顯得出科學的精萃和價値來。</p>
<p>（六）新舊藥業之營業情形</p>
<p>舊藥業在民國地二十年以前，頗稱蒸蒸日上。因爲安慶自從光緒二十七年水災以後，歷次光復北伐，都没有遭受一次大的糜爛。一切商業都能欣欣向榮，舊藥業自也不能例外。到了民國二十年長江大水，安徽沿江各縣的農田，都遭洪水淹没，農村破產，商業蕭條，又因内地金融日形緊縮，舊藥糳亦因之大受影響。一般最大的批發藥舖，則鄉鎭賬目欠收。而門市藥舖，利益最厚的，爲參燕膏丸，一般中產之家，實行節儉，多不配製補藥，營業的收入自亦大見减色。統計全市舊藥店，大小約在七八十家，然而營業的大小，亦頗有出入。最大的藥店，一年營業的比額，也可以達到四五萬元。</p>
<p>新藥業，在外表上看，好像蓬勃發達，實際呢，也是受着天災的顚簸，落得個外强中乾，眞有實力的，確是很少。全市新藥房，總共不過十四家，除了售　些成藥，醫療器械，及一切化裝品外，能代醫師配方的，祇有華洋和溥薄利</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>兩家藥房。然由正式藥劑師主持配方的，尚没有經見，這確是安慶新醫藥界一件憾事。至於大藥房的營業比額，每家也可達到萬元以上。</p>
<p>新舊藥業的營業竸爭，在安慶並不緊張。舊藥業很早就有［藥業公所］設立，近年來，新藥業也有［藥業公會］的组織。在精神方面的比較以新藥業公會有點生氣；經費方面的以舊藥業公所比較充足。曾有一度盛傳新舊藥界團體有合併的消息，但至今尚未實現。</p>
<p>（七）結論</p>
<p>上面所寫的，不過是一幅安慶醫藥衛生狀况的縮影。若將它當作文獻材料，當然是不够。作者在結束此文的時候。除了希望各地關心醫藥衛生的人們，多供給此類材料以備參考外；更希望熱心醫藥衛生的份子，能够製定一種表格，將所需要明瞭的幾點，分門别類，列在表上，分給各地醫師公會或衛生機關或私人去塡寫，我想將來的收穫，更比較整飭而且合乎標準的需要。同情我們要求的醫藥家衛生家，請大家共同努力！</p>
<h3 id="c186">疾病常識問答 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（四）（十）（一）胃下垂症和胃弛緩症</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做胃下垂症？</p>
<p>（答）是胃臟的位置較在正常位置低下的病症。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣能起胃下垂症？</p>
<p>（答）凡體質無力的人，或穿緊小馬甲的婦人，上腹部受壓迫，腹壓减退，婦人分娩後，或腹水病人穿刺後，懸垂腹，脂肪過多，腹肌無力的人都容易起胃下垂症的。</p>
<p>（問）發生胃下垂症後，病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）無論下垂的程度怎樣著明，也不起什麽特别障礙。可是病人自覺胃部有壓迫感，充滿感，噯氣，嘔吐，和胃痛發作。也有伴以胃運動障礙或分泌障礙的。</p>
<p>（問）在腹部外面，可以看出什麽情狀？</p>
<p>（答）病人的上腹部陷没，而臍下方却很隆起。</p>
<p>（問）觸診的時候有何異狀？</p>
<p>（答）用手指突然向隆起的腹部按觸時，可以聽到著明的波動性雜音。</p>
<p>（問）還要併發什麽病症？</p>
<p>（答）大都併發胃弛缓症和胃擴張症的。也有併發胃臓和腸下垂症。</p>
<p>（問）治療胃下垂症。應該吃什麽藥品和怎樣注意飲食？</p>
<p>（答）應該先使病人的體格强壯，可内服强壯劑像砒製劑，奎寗劑等。飲食，須選取營養豐富而分量較小的東西，並且每回不可儘量多吃多喝，以减輕胃内的負担。</p>
<p>（問）有没有理學的療法來治這種胃下垂症呢？</p>
<p>（答）有的。像應用腹帶使胃部抬高；或用電療，按摩，水治法使腹肌和胃胃肌緊張有力；都可試用。</p>
<p>（問）可用手術治療的嗎？</p>
<p>（答）外科手術中有胃固定術，不妨施行。</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做胃弛緩症？</p>
<p>（答）壁肌肉弛緩無力的症候。</p>
<p>（問）這種胃弛緩症是怎樣起的？</p>
<p>（答）有的是先天性的有的是因爲狂食而致胃肌過勞或弛緩無力，有的是因爲再三娩產而起。</p>
<p>（問）胃弛緩症的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）病人往往起食物停滯，發酵，和腐敗，胃内有波動雜音，更有起自家中毒　症的像頭痛。壓重感，神經不快，發生　麻疹心動緩慢，或興奮，恐怖，胸内苦悶，眩晕等。强强度的胃弛緩症，又容易合併胃擴張症。或和胃下垂佮　併而來。</p>
<p>（問）治療胃弛緩症的方法，應該怎　樣？</p>
<p>（答）可照胃下垂　症，的方法治療就行。若胃内起腐敗發酵的時候，或起自家中毒約時候，應當行胃洗滌，並内服制酵消毒劑，像雷銷辛（Resoroin）薩羅（　）之類。</p>
<h3 id="c187">發熱普通治療法（二） <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>發熱不過高不必服退熱藥或用别種方法退熱。熱度過高可以用相當的方法退熱免身内受極大的損壞。熱度不高與病有益。發熱病最平常的如癆病，傷寒病，心臓發炎，肺炎胸内生膿症，喉部發炎，盲腸炎，或身體内任何部分生膿生瘡。生膿症，盲腸炎等一方面雷外科割治，一方面也需普通治療法。普通治療法就好像一個國抵禦外侮必須先充實國力。除了特别對症治療以外，普通治療法對於任何發熱都合宜。特别是肺癆，傷寒，肺炎，心臓發炎，須格外注重普通治療法。用普通治療與否與這些病由死人生有很大的關係。並且病家明白了這種醫理普通治療法家自已也可辦得到。茲述普通治療法於後：</p>
<p>（一）靜養</p>
<p>發熱就是不過高也必須靜養，因爲身體内是有一種戰爭，將來戰爭到如何急烈程度，起始當然不易知曉。身體好像一個國家遇有侵略者須準備長期戰爭　。國力强準備充足則可得最後勝利。身體何獨不然。假如身體起始對於侵入的毒菌殺滅力很猛烈，但到最後完全喪失抵抗力則很輕的毛病也可以喪失性命。我們常看見病人病勢很輕但因没有抵抗力往往病至不起。故於病的起始以靜養培殖身體抵抗病菌的力量使全身的細胞全力加入應戰。抵抗力充足雖沉重疾病也多易起死回生。</p>
<p>有人问，靜養到底是什麽意思？靜養就是這個意思：發熱的人當日夜臥床丨丨不單是臥床，應當有周全的看護。臥床要覺着安適，不多動，大小便都應當在床上行。臥室須空氣新鮮，斷不要［怕風吹到］。須知新鮮空氣與無病人有很大益處，與有病的人豈不是更要緊麽？只要没有大風直吹就與病人無碍。新鮮空氣是不會害人的。我有一次被請出診，到了一家，一個女人是產後平常發熱。家衷没人照顧，只有一個娘役服侍。這個女人上午起發熱，所住的前樓門窗緊閉（秋天時天氣還熱）這位病人的熱度渐漸加高直至昏迷。她的娘役纔告訴隣人。隣人便義務去請我。我到了那房子内覺得悶熱，量病人的體温爲一百零七度。隨後她的產科醫師趕到我便辭去。後聽見當日晚這一位便病殁。假設室内有新鮮空氣這一位决不至於熱度骤升一百零七度。這不過是一例。我想很多人都曉得化學的一個平常試騐。就是將一燃着的蠟燭用一大玻璃瓶罩着，蠟燭火頭立時由小而滅。無病的人尚需新鮮空氣而生存，病勢沉重豈不更十百倍需要新鮮空氣呢。</p>
<p>病人靜臥也需有人照顧他在出汗後不受凉。濕的衣服須小心換去。病人也需每天一兩次洗身。洗身法，用毛巾温水將病人一部分一部分用肥皂洗後用乾毛巾擦乾。洗潔的皮　可以帮助身體排洩。洗身以外每晚應當用火酒擦背免久臥身背生臥床瘡。一日好幾次帮助病人翻身免肺下部生肺炎，（年老的人特别要緊）。病人臥的被單應當時時展平連一個　子也不要有。</p>
<p>靜養不但是身體休息連腦筋也必須休息。病人當將一切我利之念置於度外</p>
<p>。如果熱度不高長外臥床另外有些有益的消遺法亦無不可。特别是那些長期休養肺癆或心臓病的，一日之中用些時學自然學，外國語，速記，編籃，織手工也是很好。至於爭勝負的遊戲與身體有害，不可行，因易使病人過於疲乏。</p>
<p>發熱的人必須有相當的睡眠。充足的睡眠與將來的全愈有很大的關係。病人如夜間睡眠不够可呌他白日睡。病人的環境如果特别安靜大槪没有困難睡眠。在家中養病不可不注意病人的環境須安靜。台果眞没有法子睡眠可少服安眠講。熱度過高病人神志不清務須有一兩人常在病床之側以免病人隨床或别種不幸意外事發生。（未完）</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第八章　臨床檢查法</p>
<p>在前章裏面所述的種種症象，假使有人已經有一部分，甚至已全部都　發現了，那末，是不是此人之患肺結核症，已没有疑問了嗎？這當然不會如此簡單輕易的。我們要曉得，本症的一般症象，像身體消瘦，食慾不佳，顏色蒼白等，這一種潛伏性的經過，狠可使人想像或揣測的，但並不是必然的。每日温的度的測量，比較的總算最可靠了；但對於急性開始的一種型式，還是和尋常的感冒症分别不了的，其他的症象，更可由此而推了。如果我們要想解决此重大疑問，（是否爲肺結核症無疑？）就是：除開病人自述的主觀種種症象外，醫家也應該重估使佔一番，另向客觀方面去想法子證明的；這裏面的種種詳情，就是本章所述的臨床檢查法了！退一步講，作算本病單憑幾種症象，已經有了正確的診斷，這種手續還是省不了的。讀者們諒　記得，在第五裏面曾經説過，本症因病理解剖上性質不同，係有好幾種分類的；這方面的預後揣測固不一樣，就是治療方面的進行，也是各異其政的。像金屬品製劑和結核菌素之於本病，對於慢性增生性是狠相宜的，但如果是滲出性急性開始的話，就不　相宜了。人工氣胸治療本病的成績，總算是有口皆碑了；但對於浸　面積太廣空洞發現太多的本病，還是要三思而後行的。這種然否的决斷，决不是　靠病者口述的主觀症象就可了事的；像臨床檢查法中的打診　診以及火光檢查等工作，在這個時候都是省不了的。這種工作，表面上看起來是狠琐碎的，其實是明察秋毫，堪當［洞照　結］而無愧的。</p>
<h3 id="c189">耳鼻喉眼衛生常識 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（十八）砂眼</p>
<p>砂眼如有相當的程度。而尚不加以治療的時候。那就便會發生種種的危險症候和各樣的合併症。我現在大略分别講一講如左。</p>
<p>（一）砂眼性　Pannus　諪個病象，在砂眼當中。要算最多最容易發生的一種主徴。他的發生原因。是因爲砂眼的程度過深。角膜（俗名眼黑）的表面。漸次生起混濁。角膜的上皮。也同時增殖。一方面新生血管。所以Pannus　的外觀。是一種肉樣灰白色而帶血絲的顏色。他的發生部位。起始是地角膜的上綠。漸次向下方進行。如果一旦侵及瞳孔領。患者卽可感覺視力障碍。若角膜全面都被侵及的時候。那就同失明的一樣了。</p>
<p>（二）角膜潰瘍　常常生在角膜的邊綠。或同Pannus合併發生。工生於和健康角膜的交界處。此種潰痬治愈後。往往殘留混濁。妨碍視力。</p>
<p>（三）眼臉彎曲及睫毛亂生　砂眼在輕症的時候。若不施行適當的治療。日後可因結膜和軟骨的瘢痕枚縮的原故。而使眼臉彎曲。此時睫毛往往亂生。刺戟角膜。發生炎症。或者在上眼臉。發生眼臉内翻症。在下眼臉。發生眼臉外翻症。</p>
<p>（四）眼球乾燥症，因爲結膜萎縮的給果。所以他的分泌作用消失。涙液的產生量。亦漸次减少。他的粘稠度亦增另。此時患者眼内感覺乾燥。角膜的表面。亦肥厚乾爆。而不透明。有砂眼的病人。如有這種乾燥症發生。那就很不容易治愈。卽使病人已經失明。然而此種乾燥感覺。依舊是免不了的啊。</p>
<p>（五）角膜翳　在Pannus漸次吸收，而恢復透明的時候。常常殘留角膜翳。</p>
<p>（六）上眼臉下垂　我們往往看見患着砂眼病人的上眼臉。時常下垂。他的眼睛。好像終日閉着的一樣。</p>
<p>砂眼的豫後。究竟是好是壤。這是很難回答的一句話。是完全關於砂眼的輕重，治療的時期，治療的是否適當，病家耐性的有無等等而有不分。所以有時候可以完全治愈。有時候遺下視力障碍或合併症。有時候危險症候漸次增劇而致失明。</p>
<p>砂眼的豫防法，可分作廣義的和狹義的兩種。狹義的豫防法。就是個人注重眼部的衛生。像（一）勿用公共的手巾和冼面盆。（二）勿多接近患有砂眼的親友。均要直接或間接避去砂眼的傳染。至於廣義的豫防法。那就他的範圍。更爲廣大了。就　是（一）須由政府主持設法提倡［如何可以擈滅這種可恥的國民病］。（二）由社會領袖負責實施宣傳的工作，要有和夏季辦理预防救治霍亂一樣的精神。（三）學校當局，須監督校醫。檢騐學生。有無砂眼。若有輕症砂眼。卽囑加以治療。若爲重症的時候。則宜暫時退學。回家托醫治療。可以免去同學間的傳染。我們知道學生，是國家的重要原子。也就是國家的未來代表。如果都染上了砂眼。豈不是變爲砂眼的原子。也就是變爲國家的未來的砂眼代表。這是一椿怎樣痛心可恥的事體。所以我要奉勸學校當局。對於砂眼的預防工作。稍加以注意啊。説起來。也許比較指導敎育一層。選要緊要些呢。（四）監獄和工塲的負責人員。也應該實行砂眼的预防。因爲人衆羣雜。較易傳染啊。</p>
<p>講到砂眼的治療方法。普通可分爲二。就是藥物的治療法和手術的療法。他的主要目的。是（一）少傷結膜。（二）少害生理的機能。（三）使他勿生瘢痕。（四）避免角膜的合併症。（五）設法减退炎症和他的分泌物。關於藥物的療法。不必一定要由眼科醫師治療。大槪正式醫師都可醫治的。如果從藥物的療法，不能得到希望全治的時候。那就應當由眼科醫師施行手術的療法。最宜手術的時期。就是在炎症消失，分泌减退，結膜的充血和混濁都退去，和顆粒已經限局的出現等等時候。手術的止的。是在根本除去砂眼的病理產生物。設法保持結膜的生理機能。他的方法，有燒灼，撚爬，挫出，壓出，擦過等式。關於究竟用那一種方法來得好的問題。當然要由醫師診察病情後。始可解决啊。</p>

<p>— 閻絲儒</p>
<p>紅十字會醫院兒科主任高鐃朗先生。最近寫成［兒童傳染病］一書。内容甚爲豐富。據編者云。著此書之動機爲時已久。初擬擇一外國兒科善本。每日譯數千字。估計一年。約要卒業。乃細審歐美各種兒科敎本。無一愜當者。倘譯時隨意　改。則不信確。蓋外國兒科敎本槪具二種特點。一卽各求適用於其本國之特情。二則著作者特長於某病。對於該症。叙述特精。此固爲各書所應有之精彩。然迻之於吾國。則驟减色。吾國地大民衆。天時地理。南北逈殊。風氣習尚。東西亦異。疾病之種類及其分佈狀况。病程確情。豫后吉兇。同在國内。已不一致。比諸外國。參差自更繁多。故遂幡然改途。决計自編。以求適用。</p>

<p>去年海京伯馬戲，轟動全市；前月又有咸士頓馬戲到來，據説生意也很盛。一般人都知道現在所謂馬戲，是創自西洋的，但西洋未曾將馬戲輸入我國時，我國原來也有與馬戲相同的東西，不過名稱不同，組織没有這樣完備罷了。</p>
<p>馬劇班的内容　，除了藝人弄弄幾項技術外，最大的特徴是敎獸類做戲，我國走江湖賣藥的，有時也弄弄狗熊，這不是我國特有的小馬戲班嗎？但敎虎豹等類猛獸做戲，我國却少見，敎它們作他種動作的，在四五千年前則早已有了，雖然敎猛獸作他種動作，和馬戲班敎獸類做戲的性質，絶不相同，但欲使猛頑的獸類服從人的指揮則一也。在黄帝時代，炎帝興兵與黄帝戰于阪原之野，那時黄帝就是訓練猛獸，呌它們去應戰。史記五帝本紀上説，敎熊羅貔貅虎以與炎帝戰於阪原之野，就是指此而説，那麽，黄帝敎猛獸依人意去出戰，的　可以説是馬戲班中訓綀猛獸的始祖了。</p>

<p>二，麪點之部</p>
<p>緊酵饅頭　多數人傳説，南翔的緊酵饅頭是出名的，殊不知羅店的緊酵饅頭，在實際優勝多多！羅店的緊酵饅頭，外皮眞和很薄的餛飩皮一般地薄，内包一　的汁，纔出籠時熱吃最好。他在常時是用猪肉做餡，現在正當蚌蟹上市，是極好的做饅頭食餡的作料，况且清水河裏的蟹又是優越的產品。你若敎店家把蝦仁或鷄肉定做爲饅頭的餡，也是很便利的，當然，那味道要比猪肉餡勝了。你吃到了羅店的緊酵饅頭，當會感覺到南翔的出品，猶如處士之純盜虚聲，至若上海城隍廟一帶店家所製的，更是［自　以下，不足數也］了！</p>
<p>鬆酵饅頭　同是饅頭之類，而鬆酵有鬆酵的長處。鬆酵饅頭巨大好似飯碗口一般，其軟似棉，是發酵透了的綠故。看到了纔出籠的鬆酵　饅頭的形狀，很容易聯想到富有健康美的婦人的乳部了！普通發　賣的，有大肉餡和猪油夾沙餡，當然都有很多量的容納，可是眞能賞識鬆酵饅頭的人，還是愛他麵皮的特别鬆軟。要是自已備了上細的餡，交給店家定做，自然是相得益彰，更加可口了！這種適口而易飽的點心，頗有北方麵點的風味咧！</p>
<p>切麵　長條的麵，和手工在板刀下切成，不知如何，羅店麵作司務的手法，切出來特别地細！這是根本估了優勝的地位，不論用什麽澆頭做湯麵或炒麵，總自高人一等，給喜歡吃麵的人歡迎而特别提及了。</p>
<p>三，乾點之部</p>
<p>猪油鷄蛋糕　這裏所講的乾點心，衹限於店家發賣的。像猪油鷄蛋糕，是最著名的一種，猪油塊嵌滿在面上，鷄蛋和在麵裏特别多量，造成香，甜，肥，軟的食品。這最好恰巧逢着在纔做出的時候購食，莫不譽爲蛋糕中的極品，雖然西點中的各色花樣的蛋糕，也趕不上他；不過所買冷的居多，你帶回去還是不要怕麻烦，在要吃的時候先蒸一下，就也和纔做出時的味道無異了。爲了所製大小很不一律，發賣的價格是論重而不論件的。</p>
<p>蜜糕　羅店茶食店裏出品的蜜糕，比較無論何地的，是軟得多了！他還有一點長處，是不像他地所製，多數是惡甜的，可以供給你多吃一點。西人稱新婚的一個月時期爲［蜜月］，我國舊俗，辦婚事的儀式中，用蜜糕爲饋贈品，也是採取［其甜如蜜］的彩剅，我想如果人家婚事中要用蜜糕，都極該購辦羅店的蜜糕，那麽，將來伉儷間的捾情，也像羅店蜜糕那樣地綢缪黏結，如膠如漆，難解難分，纔有趣哩！</p>

<p>太后原是很歡喜乘船的，伊有兩條御用的遊艇置備着，每逢伊高興的時候，就在頣和園的昆明湖上來來往往的划着：可惜這兩條游艇眞是太大而太笨了，划的時候，非有許多的太監同時努力不可，因此反覺毫無與味。如果要裝載起來，至少得佔到一輛平車。但是我可以斷然的説：假使太后在未啟程以前，早知道這裏有這麽一條可愛的長河，堪供玩賞的話，伊必不惜特調一輛平車，把那遊艇帶着同走；卽使不曾預先知道，而現在還有極迅速的方法，可以派人回去立刻裝載來的話，伊也必不惜任何費用，馬上會敎人趕去弄一條來。無奈如今還没有這種好的方法，從這裏到北京去，一來一回，至少要兩天工夫，難道好讓太后就在這裏守候着嗎？因此，伊老人家也不作此想了丨祇是頻頻暎息，表示無限的惋惜和留戀。我忍不住私下請問伊，如果我們眞把那遊艇帶了來，伊將如何的玩法？這一問，倒使伊很上勁起來，像一個渴極的人，聽人家提起了茶的滋味一樣的上勁。伊説，伊要和我們一起坐在那遊艇裏，而讓其餘的人，依舊留在車上；但車子必須開得十分的慢，和遊艇並肩而進。這個玩法，當然是很新奇的！伊不但可以盡量的領略泛舟的樂趣，同時可以觀賞那新製的一套玩具！這列黄色火車！在路轨上徐徐滾動。不過這樣的舟車並進，將費多少人的氣力，伊却一些都不曾盤算過！（一四五）</p>

<p>— 特</p>
<p>裸體運動現在已有許多國提倡了，前月英國各處裸體運動者居然聚集倫敦，舉行第一次全國會議，他們當然是秘密開會，所以除了他們同志，和幾位報界代表之外，没有人知道集會的地點，丨是在一所有高牆圍繞的巨厦中。</p>
<p>各處裸體運動者有遠道由蘇格蘭來的，還有許多人結了團體，由北部和中地趕來與會的。　　開會禮在廣塲舉行，男女性會員，除六人外，都是赤裸裸，一絲不掛，躺着，坐着，先由主席和秘書致詞，他們也都不穿衣服，會員男女老少都有，從鷄皮鶴髮的老者，到一個四齡的女童，内中有律師，醫士，敎員等，還有一位不信國敎的牧師，另有日人和獨腿人各一。</p>
<p>當會議正在進行時，忽見有人把梯子靠在屋面，原來有一攝影師希圖偷攝會塲之影，會衆頓時大起恐慌，紛紛狂呼：［毀壞他的底片！］［趕快呌他下來！］後來把梯子取去了，會衆准許這攝影師在高樓窗上遠望。</p>
<p>主席沙勒氏的開會詞説：［這是英國裸體運動者第一次舉行全國會議，也是第一次邀請報界參加，我們請報界重視這種運動，不要視爲幻想，或視爲珗笑，裸體運動，適　社會中各種人類，是求各民族男女性完全平等的，我們預備貫澈實行這種運動］。於是會衆討論這運動的實際問題，費時很久，主席忽問誰滯有錶的，看看現在是什麽時候了？大衆聽了，面面相覻，因爲這時身上都不留一物，那裏來的錶呢，後來還是一位非日光浴者對衆報告了時間</p>
<p>開會完畢，男女會員都裸體在屋内散步，晚間，各會員组織種種遊戲，並由一位女性體擈員呌口令，指揮各人體操，大家還是精赤着］，當天男女會員參與會議的，起身之後，不一刻，便　沈完畢，男的只修修臉，女的只梳梳</p>
<p>髮，旣未穿浴衣，亦未着褲子，會議終日在陽光之中進行，在吃點心的時候，塲上凉風吹着，有幾位會員，現出寒縮的神態，顯然受不住寒威的襲擊。</p>
<p>英國裸體運動，不能说牠已普遍全國，但據蘇格蘭人報倫敦訪員聲稱，這種運動，南方人加入的渐多，倫敦商界和專門職業界中人，現在常常在星期杪帶了他們的家眷，到日光浴中心點，穿着極單薄的衣服，作户外休息，和從事游泳，但不穿衣服的，似已日見其多了。</p>
<p>就現在情形看來，參加這運動的，各團體都能嚴守禮貌，但是要勸街道中平常人入會，很不容易，唯一的困難，就是他要增進健康必須處在四面高牆之中，並且要有會員證書，而兹於裸體主義，總有説不出的一種神秘性反不如在鄉間，或在海濱，他能穿着無背的浴衣，或其他簡單的衣服，不受絲毫拘束，自由自在地淲日光浴，或作其他運動，自已旣少麻烦，又和旁人無礙，但是提倡裸體運動者别有一種見解的。</p>

<h3 id="c199">中國徴信事業的回顧與前瞻 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 潘文安</p>
<p>一　徴信事業的意義</p>
<p>徴信事業是基於信用交易而發生的一種附屬行爲。照一般經濟學家的分析，人類的交易方法，可劃分爲三個時期：(一）物物交易時期；（二）貨幣交易時期；（三）信用交易時期。時至現代，我們已進入第三時期，就是文明各國人民的商業活動，已脱不了信用的關係。所謂信用二字的涵義，究竟怎樣呢？這可以分二層來説明：</p>
<p>第一，從商品關係方面講：在現社會制度下，一面是商品的生產者把原料加上人工，製成熟货；一面是販賣者把生產者製成的熟貨，販賣給消費者。依交易的原則而論，販賣者向生產者取得商品以後，應該就把等値的貨幣，付給生產者，這樣交易就完成了。可是自從信用制度發生以後，情形就不同了；當生產者把商品賣給販賣者的時候，販賣者須待至數日或數月以後，才把等値的貨幣，償付給生產者，那末我們要研究生產者爲什麽願意把應收的貨幣，予販賣者以時間上的通融而自已擔負了相當的風險呢？這就是信用制度的作用。</p>
<p>第二，從資金關係方面講：一面是金融業收受社會羣衆的存欵，擁有多量的資金；他方面是工商業需要相當的資金，才能運用自如。所以金融業必得找尋可靠的工商業，把收入的資金，充分貨放，俾謀殖利；工商業必求助於金融業，得到資金的接濟，藉愽利潤，但是金融貨放的資金，大部份係收自存户，負有到期或隨時付還的責任，因此貸放資金的最高原則，便是安全；那末金融業憑什麽標凖，來確定安全的程度，而選檏牠的主顧呢？那便是主顧的信用，信用程度好的，便是安全，否則便地不安全。所以信用這東西，在現社會中，實具無上的權威。</p>
<p>明白了信用制度的作用，我們現在可以進一步研究徴信事業是什麽一回事。簡單的説，徴信事業便是在商品賣買上和資金供需上的一種調查信用的事業。詳細的説，當生產者把商品賒賣給販賣者之前，必先估量後者的信用程度，如果信用程度優良的，這信用交易便可成就，否則必然作罷。同樣地金融業把資金貨放與工商業之前，必先估量後者的信用程度，以保障本利的安全。這二種調查信用的工作，就是徴信事業。我們在前面所説徴信事業是　於信用交易的一種附屬行爲，也是這意思。</p>
<p>二　徴信事業歷史的𢌞顧</p>
<p>辦理徴信事業的機關，約可分公共的和私有的二種：公共的徴信機關，專以調查工商業信用及市塲消息，供給報告爲營業。凡是要想。放欵或放帪的银行廠商，均可向其諮詢客户的信用，一般人稱之爲徴信所。英國創辦最早，始於一八三０年，嗣後各國相繼設立，美國始於一八四０年，法國一八五七年，德國一八六０年，日本明治二十五年，到現在，各國辦理的成績，均斐然可觀，而尤以美日兩國，最爲發達。美國的ＲＧＤun　G　C;　Bradrtnet二家，聞名全球；牠們所報告的經濟和信用狀况，全國均奉爲圭臬。日本的大阪商業徴信所，和東京興信所，亦很見發達，至於私有的徴信機關，便是各銀行商號自已所設立的信用調查部，其任務在於考察請求融通信用的客户的經濟狀况和償債能力。這種信用調查部，現在歐美各國日本的較大商行和銀行，都有普遍設置。在英美等國，另有一種組織，就是由某種商業的同業間，定期集合主管信用調查或司帪的人員，交換客户的信用資料；如果某一商號或個人，拖欠該業中某家的貨欵，到期不付，那末該商家的出席員，必把這拖欠貨欵的商號名稱，特别提出，警惕同業；這樣可使信用不佳者，或存心頼債者，知所戒　，無形中可以發揮優勝劣敗的功用，提高商人的道德，</p>
<p>我國百事落後，工商幼稚，信用制度尚未充分運用，當然難望徴信事業的發展。就公共的徴信事業講，民國十年五月，第二届銀行公會聯合會在天津開會，曾由上海銀行公會提議，設立徴信所；天津銀行公會提議，組織國内外商情調查所，討論結果，先由各地自行創辦，至會員一層，勿庸限定地點，＝即由天津銀行公會依據議决案通知各公會，表示提倡。這件議决案，雖然給我國徴信事業史加上了一些點級，可是實際的工作，可説還是原封未動，</p>
<p>中國人的脾氣，喜歡遇事觀望，缺秒勇往邁進的精神，結果總是给外人以捷足先登的機會。徴信事業當然不能例外，當銀行公會聨合會把設立徴信所的議决案束諸高閣的當兒，美國人和日本人，却在上海越　代庖了；二十年來外人創辦的徴信所，計有左列五家之多：　　商務信託總局</p>
<p>東京興信所上海分所</p>
<p>帝國興信所上海分所</p>
<p>上　興信所</p>
<p>以住居本國的中國人的信用，而須來自異邦的外人爲之調查，豈不是一件笑話，但是在這物稀爲貴的情勢下，一般銀行廠商。向其徴取信用資料者，竟爾趨之若鶩！</p>
<p>在私有的徴信機關方面説，近六七年來，少數銀行，已設置信用調查部，如中國，上海，浙江興業，浙江實業等。可是在注重跑街制度的觀念之下，各行的調查部，也不過是因陋就簡，聊資點綴，要想充分的發揮功能，恐怕離事實尚遠。</p>
<p>以上是就二三年以前的情形説。我國的徴信事業，經過九一八和一二八兩次警礮以後，一方面因爲上海工商業的情形，每况愈下，日貨銷路，受抵制影響，大形衰落，使日商經辦的興信所，大部份都關了門；他方面因爲銀行界有了新的覺悟，認明欲期工商金融的健全發展，必先謀雙方的溝通調劑；於是中國徴信所便步聯合凖備委員會的後塵而產生，給與徴信事業以光明的展望。</p>
<p>三　徴信事業現狀的考察</p>
<p>上海银行界設立徴信所的動機，可以分爲三端：第一，以前各行的信用調查，除由外人辦理的徴信機關供給資料外，並自行派員調查，多方探訽，以憑最绪的判斷；但是常有甲行正在調查某商行，乙行也正在忙着探聽某商行，於是兩行各費了很多的力氣，結果却做了一番重複的工作；現在如果有一個共同的機關，把各行的信用調查資料，整個的集中起來，各行需要調查某　商號時，就可先把已有的資料，作爲初步的參考，再由該機關詳細調查，製成報告，分送需要各行，豈不事半功倍。第二，一二八以後，日人所辦的興信所，大部分停止營業，各行缺少了資料的來源。第三，外國人調查中國人的信用，充其量也不過得到些皮毛，欲知詳細底藴，究非外國人所能辦到：所以就是從前數年各行對於外國人製送的報告，也漸漸的失却了信頼，早有自辦徴信所的意思。有了上面三種動機，中國人自已辦理的中國徴信所，就於二十一年六月產生。</p>
<p>中國徴信所的業務，約分三項：（一）調查信用及商情　（二）行行名錄，（三）收帪欵。除第三項尚未舉辦外，第一二兩項，已頗著成效；日海中外銀行廠商聞風加入爲會員者踵相接，甚至外國的信用調查機關，也與之訂約交換資料，該所除在上海設立總所外，並在漢口，重慶，分設分所和代理處。業務發達，可　一斑。</p>
<p>中國徴信所的設立，總算替我國公欠的徴信機關創造了一個模型，將來發揚光大，正無限量。在私有的徴信機關方面，現在上海各銀行差不多都設立了調查專部或專員，對外力謀交換資料上的聯絡，對内務求與業務打成一片，各自在扶良汰劣，甄别盈虚的途上邁進着。　　四　推進徴信事業的幾個前提</p>
<p>凡一種新事業的創製，必須有孕育這種事業的先天環境的存在，欲期其長足進步，也須當極爲適宜的境遇，加以相當的培養；一二八滬戰以後，因爲前面所述的幾種原因，造成了創設徴信所的客觀條件，至今規模粗具，欲期發榮滋長，也須備具下面幾個前提：</p>
<p>第一，社會的扶助　舊式商人往往認定徴信所爲一種偵探機關，見了徴信所的代表，不問是非，深閉固拒，避之若浼；以致對於資料的徴集方面，遇到了極大的困難。平心而論，徴信所的目的，原爲使善良的和優秀的份子，有儘量給社會認識的機會，使惡劣的和窳敗的份子，給社會以愼防的警告；簡單的説，就是提高商業上的道德。徴信所旣抱負了這光明的目的，而爲社會努力，那末凡屬社會人士，當然都有開誠相見，加以扶助的義務，無待再説了。第二，制度的改進　徴信事業在歐美日本所以能突飛猛晋，固然由於歷史的悠久，而考其最大的便利，就是商界的内容，在習惯上比較的顧意公開，而使徴信所有查悉其營業數字，確斷其盈虚程度的機會。我們祇看外商的有限公司，每届會計年并終了後，都有决算報告的公佈，規模較大的公司，必把决算表在報章上發表；就是私人企業，也要比我國的公開得多。返觀我國的商界，除銀行外，有限公司組織者，把决算表在報上公佈者，可謂絶無，就是單行本營業報告，了非有密切關係者，不肯輕易洩　。其實有限公司的實質，應以財政狀況對外公開爲要件，因爲這樣才能使債權者得有察探其内容的便利，而保障其權益。關於這一點，我們希望政府的督促，將來能加以改進，那　　　所至不對於調資公司時，可以獲得拫大的便利。</p>
<p>還有歐美各國，早已實行所得税，和遺產税，團體或私人的財產，官廳均有稽考，所以比較的容易探查，可是在我國要調查一個私人企業，或個人，如果這企業或個人與外界關聯較少，那就極難確定其財產的量値；就是銀行的放欵主管員，對於借户的底子，也僅僅以一個［内容殷實］，或［身家平平］的糢糊估計來　衍，不像歐美各國的徴信所報告，和銀行廠商對主顧的信用調查，常有凖確的數字列入，這兩者辦事上的難易，和事業的優劣，不難想見了。</p>

<p>本市减租問題，喧傳經年，迄今猶在呼號請願中；其不幸者，則已涉訟法庭，照额繳納矣。論理，房租爲契約行爲，旣經約定，祇有照納之一法；如有特殊情形，民法亦未　不許以救濟，但能成立與否，至難言之。故欲减租而不付房租，即使將房租缴入銀行，在未得有房租收據以前，於契約爲不履行；司法官但知執法，一旦房東以欠租控告，房客鮮有不敗訴者。其他亦缺乏解决本事件之勇氣。不第有减租之率，難以釐訂；即能定率，糾紛亦必甚，</p>
<p>蓋不能如雙方之意，其勢然也。故若言减，將得罪於巨室，影響於捐收，不减則恐賈怨於民衆，［不痴不聾，難做阿家翁，］與其，着乎而致左右爲難，何如縅默不理之爲上也。</p>
<p>然則减租問題勢將無爲解决之乎？此非吾所能知也。最自然之解决方法當在造屋無人租，舊屋少人住，並經過較久的時日，其時房東雖欲不减租亦不可得也。現在不至有此現象，雖多空屋，所空者又以市房爲多，號房爲少；號房有空者則以西式或陳舊者爲多，中式者較少。房屋旣不虞無人住，且新造之房屋，一上一下單幢月租貴至七十元，屋未完全落成，而已定租一空，可見房屋仍多需要，並不以租價爲貴，此而言减租，不將使房東唖然失笑乎？即退而求諸［鴿籠式］房屋？以及房客頂屋之費，租金便宜者，依然要索巨額之頂費，未嘗减少，更足以助長房東之保持原租氣燄，而削弱减租之聲浪也。</p>
<p>或謂與其空閒不如减租，减租则有人租，愈於不减租而空閒，此其理由在吾儕依人爲活　屋以居者確是一把好算盤。而在有產業，尤其是以房地產爲營業者，倒不如與其减租何如空閒之爲得。蓋有房地產者，望其產業之價値提高，增殖其財富，此固心理之所同。而在以房地產爲業者，其希望房地價値提高之心理，更比有產業者爲熱切，恨不得今天買進，明天漲價，後天出賣之可立致巨利也。但如何可使房地產漲價，固然爲其環境所造成。人口繁密，交通便利，市　殷盛，房地產必貴，房地產貴，則其房租必高，反之，房租低，則其地之房地產必賤。旣然，房地產與房租之變遷成正比例，則房租之增减，影響於房地產價値之增减，蓋以房租者，原爲房地產投資之利息也。故置現成之房地產者必計算其租金收入，約當其投資所得之利率爲若干，而後購置之。其爲</p>
<p>新造房屋，亦必計算其年利應爲若干，而後匀之爲房屋之租費。今若一旦减租，即减輕其應得之利益，亦即减少其投資額之價値。此有資力者，爲欲保持其房地產之優厚價値起見，不得不出於寗可空間不肯减租之一途，以爲非照我租額，則不出租。其資力較徴薄或房租定額過高者，則出以一種變相减租，即凡住滿一年者，情讓房租一月之類，而其租額，固未嘗有所變更也。凡此所以不肯减輕其租値者，皆爲一經减租而有贬損其產業價値之危險，有使帪面發生盈虧之可虞，於是寗可空閒，寗可支出律訟費，而不肯减租也。</p>
<p>吾爲一般要求减租者進一辭，若亦放大眼光，應知現在市上許多房屋，皆爲諸君出資委托他人以經營者也。何則？蓋銀行信托之存欵，固諸君節衣縮食心血換來之金錢也。銀行集諸君之存欵，旣不用以興發工商實業，挽回利權，祇人用諸房地產業，以遂其生利之圖。巍巍大厦，高入雲霄，分行林立，有如烟紙雜貨舖，諸君莫艷羨，莫驚奇，是皆存户之皮肉骨血所造來也。則今日之不肯减低房租，安知不爲諸君存欵之保障穩固起見，諸君何必提倡减租而自招不利耶！</p>
<p>且焉房租减則房捐少，地價跌則税收絀，此爲業主以外之利害關係也。由此觀之，一般减租問題，正爲牽涉太多，難得解决。何况華洋錯雜，劃一之辦法，或不能通行而無阻，左支右絀，荏苒經年，恐亦在此。</p>
<p>欲解决住之問題，非單純的之房租問題也。房租低，固爲房客所歡迎，而其利益，亦不完全集於房客身上，儘有房租雖　，反而造成［二房東］獲利之機會。亦有房租太低，房東以無利可圖，任其坍敗，不加修葺，不知建築，因之市面同受其累者，一二八以前之闸北是也。蓋房租之搆成，其方式約如下列：</p>
<p>地價十建築賣十設備費）Ｘ利率𠄠利息</p>
<p>房租十利息十捐税𠄠�</p>
<p>房租之貴，土地估價，每次提高，實有以促成之。地價高，則成本重，而房租贵。然地價之提高，公私所同願也，用何術以限制之。無他，祇有實行中山先生平均地權之一法，溢得之利，用以歸公，操縱地價者無的覬觎，地價工可歸於平凖，房租可望穩定。其次則自起组織住宅建築合作，一面融通資金，以圖實現，然此又非小有資產者所不辦，亦非大衆所能也。即使融通資金，一分以上之高利貨，房屋落成，債臺已高築矣。又其次只希望多建築平民住所，爲一般薪水階級之用，此亦渺茫，現在之平民住所，大都爲草棚中住户計，尚不盡能［出於幽谷，遷於喬木，］遑論其餘！</p>

<p>— 楊德惠</p>
<p>上海的人口，由八十年前七萬五千人，激增到今日三百三十六萬人；在最近的將來，人口的增加趨勢，恐不以是爲最高，這是誰也不會否認的。因爲人口的增加，房屋的需要，自然是要增加！而土地需用，也因房屋建築增加</p>
<p>而增漲其價値了。一個都市的膨脹與否，由於人口消長得到精確結果；而房屋建築關係人口的膨脹和地價的高漲，原有連鎖性的。上海在這樣情况之下隨時的變態中，對於居住的狀况，是値得我們明白的，而且最近的减租運動，原则也基於居隹上的問題呢！</p>
<p>在上海，房屋的建築種類，是需要方面的分别，棧房，市房，公寓，寫字間，中式住宅，西式住宅，六種；除了棧房公寓寫字間外，其居住方面，是屬中西式的住宅了。以三十三年來上海的居住狀況怎樣，可在房屋租賃上得到一個精確的统計，下面一個表，是指公共租界一主方面；但是公共租界，可以爲全上海的縮影。</p>

<p>（註）每年以第四季爲標準一九三四年係第一季</p>
<p>在上面這個表裏，西式房屋的未租赁率，以一九０一年爲最低。僅一·四％，最高爲一九一０年的一四·八％；因爲那時却巧椽皮股票風潮的發生以後，所以，其未租儹房屋，有這樣的多。去年一九三三年，其未租赁者已達一二·八％，今年第一季一四·０％，開一九一０年後的高記錄。至於中式住宅呢，其未租赁率較西式住宅爲低，在表裏已明白地指示着，這因爲公共租界的人口，當然華人以主體，歷年來國内時局的不寗，天災人禍的降臨，匪共的蹂躪，一般稍有資產階級，認租界是安樂窝，所以都向租界裏來居住了；正因是這樣，而其未租賃率，在近三年來，僅佔六分之四，比較西式住宅未租賃率，要差六分之八呢！同時，中式住宅的合式優美的很難找着，一般的不得不租賃西式住宅，在這裏，是逐年的增高着，當一九０五年，華人居住西式住宅率百分之一０·三，一九一０年百分之一二·三，一九一五年百分之十八·五，一九一０年百分之廿一·五，一九二五年百分之廿二·二，一九三０年百分之三四·七，一九三二年已達百分之四０·五了，可見得華人的住西宅的現勢。　　上面曾經説過，中式住宅的未和賃率低於西式住宅，是由於界内華人的增加。當一九０五年時候，中式住宅四五，三二八，住居人口四五二，八一六人，及至一九三０年，住宅七七，九０七宅，居住的人口已是九七一，三九七人了。在廿五年來人口的增加，顯見得是增加一半以上，而住居的房屋，不到一倍，那末，其居住的擁擠，是必然的現象了。在上海一幢市房，平均要住六家，就是前後樓，前客堂，後客堂，亭子間，灶披間，所以，上海的居住，眞是白鴿籠式。舒適固然説不到，衛生何曾説得到，這是多麽苦惱呀！雖然住着白鴿籠式的房屋，而他的代價，須在中等進益的人們，才能亨受，只得將住室緊縮，此空屋所以日見其多，熱閙塲所也儘多空着。這並不是人口的减少而空閒，是因房租擔負重大實行緊縮的結果，我希望一般房東們與其空閒何如减輕房租，是較爲有利呢？</p>

<h3 id="c207">趣味 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 若木</p>
<p>凡是人便應該有趣味感</p>
<p>所謂趣味，在其自身却是有着好和壞之别。</p>
<p>在通常［趣味］與［嗜好］，斷是不能混同。蓋所謂［嗜好］，那是屬於娱樂的一種類，而［趣味］則是人類［滿足欲望］的要求。</p>
<p>像［勞作］一樣！這是値得苦痛的事情，但偏有一部份人要從事這樣笨重的工作，甚或連自已的性命都不顧惜，而拚命地在勞作着。這要説他們偏能耐得苦，那是不對的。蓋他們對於收穫的期待是太興　奮，太熱情所以才會不期然而然而把痛苦忘掉了．</p>
<p>雖然趣味是不是會在無論那一塲合，都能適應人類底要求而出現呢？同時會不會因人類的慾望繼櫝地潛存着而永遠存在呢？這在一般美術家是完全否認的。他們以爲趣味僅是暫時存在的東西。</p>
<p>趣味的敎育，對於人生是那樣底重大？這事實，像法國巨匠美寗在他的晚禱圖中，很能與我們以理解這問题的一點暗示。在他的屋裏是這樣的横繪着；一暮夜的雲是染成黄金的色，亞比馬利亞的鐘正在敲動着。在遠處的叢林中是聳出了寺院的高塔。而在另一個角落裏有二人的農夫！他們是夫婦二人，丨正完畢其一日間的勞作，而蹈上他們的歸途。正在這時，當他們聽到從遠處傳來的鐘聲的時候，他們便低下了頭，相對着，默默地向着慈愛之神祈禱着了。［這是一幅富含偉大的意味的名畫。同時在那裏也滿藏着顯示　［趣味］這東西的大道理啊！</p>
<h3 id="c208">在矛盾中 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 爾</p>
<p>生在現社會，往往這樣想，但却常常變成那麽相反的做。所謂理論與實踐，弄成矛與盾。譬如明知虚僞不對，想　老實而不虚僞，結果這樣就多不能適於求生，於是乎就不得不改爲虚僞的做。這是個人的不對吗？不是這麽簡單啊，這是受了整個矛盾的社會生活的限制，使個人不能不跟着社會，生活在矛盾中。</p>
<p>很老實的説，我們以爲女人穿高跟鞋是變成花瓶玩具，是不應該的；但往往看了女人穿高跟鞋，曲綫美顯得格外好看，就覺得不錯，想摟着玩也未嘗不可。就是女人自已，她也常有感到穿高跟鞋的確對身體不大好，而且是給男人做玩具的用意；但她終究又要與她所想的相反，迎合了社會的習尚，不得不穿高跟鞋，以免使自已在社會中受到多少損失。許多女人穿高跟鞋而不覺此者固多，但多少女　學生，她們是明知而故犯呢。特别有許多會説反對女人結男子做玩具的話的女人和男子，她們自已，他們的妻子，仍穿高跟鞋。這不是很明白的事麽？爲什麽這樣地矛盾呢？</p>
<p>也許有多少人要説，這是他們認識和意志不澈底，所以不能踐行其理論。這也是理由；不過，僅以这點理由就算全部解决，未免不成問題。</p>
<p>上面已經説過，受了整個的社會生活的限制，所以因其矛盾而矛盾。那麽‘任你意志怎樣堅强，總大半要受這種根本的限制，使你不能超出這種矛盾的生活。</p>
<p>這樣説來，就讓牠在矛盾中過活吗！也不然，我們是以爲，原因是在整個社會生活的矛盾；那麽，雖然單憑個人的意志去和牠反對，是很少效力，是要對着這整個的矛盾的着想。所以，直捷了當的説，大多數人的過着矛盾的生活，是需要一齊斜對着整個社會生活的矛盾去作根本解决，才能完全消滅了自已以陷在矛盾中。</p>
<p>特别是小布爾喬亞們，更是矛盾多端了。他多旣明白支配社會的一類是矛盾的，但是自已又是常要依附着牠而生活着，很難乾脆的完全脱開，而走到怡和這支配勢力的相反的敵對方面去，作消滅支配者的矛盾的。所以，常多徘徊在中間過着矛盾的生活。</p>
<p>如果説不能脱開整個的矛盾的社會生活，卽使個人的意志多堅强，想消滅自已在矛盾中，也怕枉然。只有根本的脱開原來的矛盾的生活，爬向新的方面，去，而等到整　個社會生活的矛盾消滅，一般的才能逃出：在矛盾中過活！</p>
<h3 id="c209">事有例外 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>

<p>有人説，今年是智識階級走到了末路的年頭，事實也確乎很嚴重，前有北平各大學畢業生之職業運動，後有南京中大上海曁大畢業生之響應，閙得震天價響，因此又引起了各方的評論，一邊説是絶對社會制度的不良，一邊説畢業生的本身不健全及慾望太高，以上兩説，天然各有理由，尤其是前説更爲有力，這没有疑義的，但是事有例外。</p>
<p>是這個星期三，友人Ｘ君特地來會我，要我給他找一個農業敎員，他説自已已經找了一個整星期，没有找到，知道我與ＸＸ農校有點關係，特來找我設法，於是我就答應给他找，自審這方面的朋友有好幾個，而又與ＸＸ農校有點關係，找起來總有相當把握。乃知事實竟大謬不然，找到現在已是整個四天了，還没有辦法，只得回報呌他另請高明。</p>
<p>其次，我又親聽過人家説起，暑期各大學的畢業生都感到没有出路，但却有兩個學校裏的是例外。其一是本埠ＸＸ國立大學，有一系銀行系的畢業生，個個都　被銀行預定去了，而且還問學校當局有不有。又有北平ＸＸ國立大學，有一系經濟系的畢業生，也個個被人預定好，一出校門就有着事做，不但没有［失業］二個字眼，連稍事休息的時間都没得。</p>
<p>這是千眞萬確的事實，一是我自已經歷的，一是别人經歷的，從這事實上可以看得分明，靑年决不是全無出路，不過本身確實要相當的健全。一般野雞學校，出來的靑年，自然得皺皺眉頭。其次呢，中國的學制確乎需要一番整頓，文科的繁興，搖筆桿子的朋友的擁擠，自然出路是有問題了。我們是一個農業國，而又迫切的需要趕上工業的路程，事實上是很需要這般人才。</p>

<p>— 席珍</p>
<p>纔過了中秋節没幾天。村裏，街上，疎疎落落地下着毛毛雨；天氣又轉成</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>悶悶的。鄉村裏的人全都嘆着閑氣，瞧那田裏的枯欄了的稻桿。六歲以上的孩子晚上便拿了小鐵鍫到大户的家園子裏去偷山芋，拿回來好做明天的飯。大人們在家裏做篾籃，做纱綫，預備到街上去呌賣換幾個錢過冬，在城裏有熟人的便整天在街上跑；［你老説比我們好一點兒，鄉下荒年，城裏説不至於有什麽吧，你老帮一點忙吧。］</p>
<p>［那裏的話，城裏人也有城裏人的苦，這節邊的情形怎樣，不説就知道，這年頭是誰都好不了的。］</p>
<p>大家把眉稍擠了攏來；没辦法！</p>
<p>雨有意無意地下着，人們是全没有急切的希望咧。已經到了八月，下雨有什麽希望呢。［天敎人去做强盜，那是没有辦法的！］</p>
<p>過了一個凄凉的中秋節（這一年，鎭上的唯一的一家香燭店裏在這全村二百多户人家中祇賣去了二隻香斗，一隻是村頭王老爺家的，還有一只是敎書先生李老的學堂裏的。）而節後的市面却更凄凉了；鎭上關了五家店舖，其中一爿是米店：米漲到了十一元八，連中上的人家都不吃米了，三個月旱荒的時期祇賣去了八石米；還有一家是三阿爹的哥哥老二的以八十元起本的［京廣雜貨］舖。人們連山芋都漸漸地吃不到了，有的到南貨店去買珍珠米乾，有的吃大户入家喂鷄的米屑（這是不容易拿到的，每天有許多人等着搶。）</p>
<p>老二一家到上海做工去了（自然是把店裏的貨色偷偷地帶出了一部份的），三阿爹要呌阿虎跟着去，可是老二他們不肯，再三説，［自家弟兄，這一點都辦不到吗？這孩子要做點什麽還行，到了上海决不拖累你們的，讓他拉洋車，做化兒都行。］</p>
<p>這麽看，阿虎也走掉了。</p>
<p>留着三阿爹一個，每天吃四個山芋，駡天，駡時代，駡命運，駡今年五十九歲的關口，駡這個那個。</p>
<p>那天是十九，黄昏還有很好的月亮，天冷得已經可以了，風吹上來帶了一點尖刺味。（可是，在白天，還有人把稀破的棉襖袴拿到當舖裏去求那麽三四百錢的呢。）天黑的時候，三阿爹剛到床上睡好（這時節是什麽人家都不點燈的。）王老爺家的沈福急急地敲着門；［三阿爹，老爺呌你就去。］</p>
<p>擅抖着；［沈福哥，裏面坐，是不是那今的田裏的事情呢？老爺那天下鄉看租，什麽都看見的。荒也不是我們······］</p>
<p>［不是的，我們一家明天都要搬到上海姑太太那裏去了。晚上忙得大家都昏了頭，呌你馬上就去帮着搬東西，還有丨］</p>
<p>還有，王老爺因爲三阿爹是［三代的老佃户］，而且又是一個兒，清清爽爽的，要呌他到空宅裏去看屋子。</p>
<p>在暗黄的大保險燈光下面顯露了一個個悉傷的臉，老爺，太太，姨太太，還有那穿着外國裝的在上海大學堂裏讀書的少爺。大家都懷着一顆逃難的心情；［早一點把東西弄好，明天一早走。］</p>
<p>瞧着這情形，三阿爹的心像沉在冰窟裏那麽的，一家偌大的世家也説有一天倒下來了。像參加着喪禮一樣的，心頭有無數説不出的手在抓抓。</p>
<p>晚上，有好的月亮，三阿爹就睡在沈福的房裏。［鄉下到底完了，］沈福告訴他；大少爺在上海託人弄到了一個敎書先生的事情，每月有二十多塊錢；老爺手頭究竟還有百來塊現洋，他們説到上海總有法子相的，多少混他一年再説，［再不是，連發財票都可以買買的。］</p>
<p>沈福爬上床，翻　了一個身便打呼了。三阿爹可睡不着，睜着眼看地上的一片的月光，他腦子裏所包含的疑問太多了。可是忽然，像得到了一點啟示似的，他想；［鄉下是準完了，可是到上海去，也最多買買發財票罷啦。］</p>
<p>這麽着，翻了個身，便想起了流浪在這大都會裏的阿虎。</p>
<p>夜是死寂的。</p>
<h3 id="c212">秋夜 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 突</p>
<p>秋風輕拂着岸邊的槐樹，葉兒在微微地嚮着，秋夜的月亮，顯得格外的瑩潔。夜雖已經是深了，可是，我和鏞却還徘徊的在這岸邊。</p>
<p>深夜的海潮，漸漸地在澎漲，潮濤擊着了岸邊的亂石，飛起了迷眼的浪花，發出着撩人的音嚮。月光照耀着海面，閃燦着銀色的波紋，那遠方浮沉的魚舟，孤燈盞盞地好似燐火的跳躍。南國的海邊，到底是美弱啊！尤是在這夜深的秋天。</p>
<p>沉默，沉默，一切的景色在月光之下沉默，祇有那潮浪和樹葉的聲音，合着節拍的奏着秋愁的夜曲。</p>
<p>［明；你看，今晚的月亮多末好呀！］</p>
<p>沉默着很久的鏞，終於打開着他那可親的笑臉，指着已經高掛上了中天的的月亮説着。不然而然的就在他的臉上露出着愉快的笑影，他好似忘去了他心中的　絡了。站起來，拉着我的手。</p>
<p>［幹麽呢？你這樣的興奮］？</p>
<p>［你呆什麽呢？祇有這今晚了，我們興奮點的談吧］！</p>
<p>祇説了一句，我又沉默了，雖然心中有着不少的話想説，可是，都礙在喉管裏的説不出來。他的這樣興奮，是使我更加的沉默了。</p>
<p>秋夜的微風，吹進了單薄的内花，身上就感到了一陣陣地凉意。我俩却還是徘徊的在這岸邊，好似那輕微的秋風，是愁絲般的吹進了孤寂的心房。低頭望着兩條瘦長的黒影，祇有感到人生的旅程，有如這黑影的受着人們的足所踐踏的悲哀。</p>
<p>［明丨别再痴想着了，我到了明天，就得離開這裏了。你知道，家庭的環境是不容許我再住足了。愉快的生活，在我别竟是不會再有了，不過，我想這次的離開，總有一天，我們是會再見到的。</p>
<p>［我也這未想，我們是會再見］。</p>
<p>月光照射着鏞的瘦黄蒼白的臉，風吹動着他的蓬亂的頭髮，他臉上那剛才很興奮的笑影，漸漸地消沉去了，他那對美弱的黑眼，不轉的望着那海的無涯的遠方。默默的在沉思着。</p>
<p>夜，秋天的夜，愁緒不絶的有如蠶絲的綿長，纏住着我的深心，我和鏞終於在這海邊，蹣跚的徘徊了一整夜。</p>
<p>清晨是會使人興奮的，秋天的太陽是會令人歡愛的，就在這一天的清晨，鏞，他抱着一顆悲寂的心，離開了舊鄉，走上了征途，向着遠隔茫茫底大海的赤道綫漂去了。</p>
<p>一年容易又秋天，相隔了一年，終於得到關於鏞的消息了，而且是一個不幸的消息呀！他，我的愛友鏞，營在到達彼岸後之三個月，就失去了知覺，與着人世間離别的長逝了。</p>
<p>一個靑年，一個有爲的靑年，終於在亞社會之桶裏，在生活的鞭子下，喪失了他的生命了。</p>
<p>秋，是一個多未令人悲愁的秋啊！每當在深沉的夜裏，月亮照着窗前的時候，我祇有望着那瑩潔的月亮，碧藍的天空，我深深地在追憶着那悲愁的往事</p>

<p>— 小林</p>
<p>人們都説上海是人間的天堂，滿地是金銀。於是上海是値得讚美和光顧的了。不信，且看高入雲霄的摩天樓一天天的增加着，建造着，跳舞塲大酒館無限量的繼續出現。這些銷金窟的地方，上海還不是一個金子的世界麽？</p>
<p>上海果眞是値得讚美的麽。然而一般人確是在贊美着的。於是從内地各城市各村落成天就有成百成千　的人，背别鄉井，離了家，過山過海的奔向這天堂的上海來了。帶着一個拾金子的愉快的心。至於上海是比較容易有得飯吃的。不錯，倘若大的地方，那麽多的工廠，找一口飯應該是不難的了。不過找飯吃的人不止一二個。而是有無數的人們在張開着嘴等者。</p>
<p>有幾個眞的找到飯吃。他們在未到上海之前所唸住的滿腔的歡快和美麗的希望，只消一踏上這塊地，就立刻碰碎了。</p>
<p>上海是不是可讚頌的？要住住才知道。再住下去，準會上海有什麽可讚頌呢，而是可詛咒的啊，那麽駡着。但是駡要徒然。肚子不能老空着，需要吃，然而飯不是輕易吃得着的。已經來了，想做活無從可做，要回去又回不得，於是就流落。流落，或竟走入岐途，這樣世界是日，就不安了。</p>
<p>是的，在另一面，上海是値得讚頌的，歌弦帶樂，金迷純醉。然而這究底是另一個世界。和他們没一點關係的。他們的世界是黑暗，飢餓，疾病，死亡。所以上海是可詛咒的。誰説不？</p>

<h3 id="c214">到了東京 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 王慈</p>
<p>我到東京後，曾有一明片給你。我是在六月十九日午前九時搭上海丸離滬的，於二十二日上午七時二十分始達東京。這三天三夜中，因晕了三天兩夜的船，和在火車中一夜没有睡的原故，我的身子像大病初愈般的疲憊，動彈不得。</p>
<p>這次赴日，同行的尚有兩位姓唐的同學，現在和我一同住在東京本鄉區追分町三十一番地中華學舍中。</p>
<p>日本的菜，我們果然不能吃；而日本化了的中國菜（所謂支那料理）也非常難於上口。</p>
<p>我雖然到了日本，可是，我不大明日語，我對於下女，往往弄到瞳目結舌，不知所措。現在已進了東京日語補習學校，每天上午八時　趕到六七裏遠的學校裏去上課，爲了金錢的綠故，我們不坐電車，（在東京，電車眞是多極了，地上的轨道如蛛網似的密外，尚有公共汽車和地下電車，而且，現在正在趕造地下火車的軌道；這地下電車和火車，據説是防世界大戰的），因此，我們每天有走八十分鐘路的必修課。</p>
<p>在日本，男女間的關係是無所謂的。我初到日本的第二天晚上，一位在日本住了一年以上的朋友張君帶我到日本浴堂裏去洗浴。眞使我驚奇；日本的男女浴堂是置在一間房子中的，其界限僅是和身體一樣高的短牆，若使比我長半個頭，立在牆根，就可是看到另一面的動作。短牆的一端，有一高高的櫃台和一木板小門。櫃台上坐着年輕的盛裝的女掌櫃；年輕的下女們。在數十條赤裸裸一絲不掛的肉林中毫無忌憚地，司空見惯地奔來奔去照料；她們對於裸體了的男子。似乎没有感到什麽驚異，因爲我看見她們一點不害羞地對着赤身的男子　　。　　的小門是虚掩着的，下女在這門中跑來跑去兩面照應。在這門縫中，我們可以看到浴罷了的少女在穿褲子或紥背上的小包袱。牆是太低了，女浴室中的華水聲和嬌憨聲都能很清楚的　進我們的耳朶。</p>
<p>昨天，和唐氏兄弟邀［上野公園］，在公園中，有一所大洋房便是國防愽覽會的會塲。愽覽會的大門前有一造得還不久的大牌樓，這是紀念日本皇太子的誔辰的。在這牌樓上，我國山海關上的［天下第一關］的扁額赫然在矣！在這牌樓對面，有一紀念台灣之役中陣亡將士的石碑，在此石碑的四周，圖以在此役中所獲得中國的大砲彈。（這砲彈竪在地上，足有兩英尺半高。在砲彈兩側裝上鐵圏，連以鐵鍊，作爲這石碑的鐵欄杆），在這石碑的左側，有在此役中所獲得之大鐵錨竪在那裏，高度：有我一個半人開外。走出上野公園後，我們三人化了四十五錢（値中國四角五分弱）進動物園去參觀：這動物園很偉大，有二十個上海文廟公園的動物園那末大，</p>
<p>日本的文學書，眞是出乎意料之外的便宜：十六開本一英寸厚布面洋裝的三十八本［世界文學全集僅售日金十元，你是讀過日文的，倘使你要買，我跟你買好了，已寫得不少了，再會吧！希望你時常有信給我。</p>

<p>— 列</p>
<p>有一個時期，我很愛吃花生米，幾乎每天都要吃，而又吃得很多，以致有時候請客，自以花生米爲無上佳品，朋友們雖然也不唾棄，但多表示幾分奇異，有些莫明其妙的樣子。</p>
<p>可是，這是我的三年前的癖好，是往事了。現在呢，我一看見花生米，就不由的感到口澀味苦。説到這一點，不免使我略略有些感傷，第一，短短的三年的人生過程，使我减興多了，在社會上滾來滾去，不但吃花生米的癖好不有了，連其他許多的愛好都先先後後的割斷了，到如今祇有還愛吸烟的一椿了。爲的是太爲生活所累，每天忙個不休，閒情自然没有了，這點，我們年靑人是多麽的引以自嘆呵！其次呢，緣着這愛吃花生米的癖好退了，就格外使我感到人生的孤寂，這裏不但是單純的咾好問題。</p>
<p>説起來，愛吃花生米的癖好並不是必然的，而是偶然的，我在故鄉，就是後來在Ｃ省城里唸書的時候，也没見過花生米這東西。有的只是落花生，這東西，我是望着就頭痛的，莫説吃它。</p>
<p>我自到上海以後，在某一個暑天裏，就開始吃花生米了，又過了一個時期，竟越吃越愛起來了，於是就成了我當時惟一的癖好。</p>
<p>同室的見着我這癖好的成長，來得突兀，總對我表示着納罕的面像，不，他是曾經肯定過説：［我這癖好是染受别人的。］我雖婉辭的解釋不是，他仍然半個不信，也就任憑他説笑了。</p>
<p>説到這裏，確曾有過這麽一截事實，同班的Ｃ，因缘於種種巧合，伊是一向對我表示好感的，可是説起來也僅僅是好感吧了，談得到什麽其他呢？連同伊到校外去散一散步，或上影戲院看一回電影，都要惹人物議，不可終日，那是一個妒嫉最甚的環境呵，凑巧的是工：伊也最好吃花生米，吃的量雖不如我之多，但愛好恐還更甚咧。</p>
<p>一朝猝變，大家星散，已是幾年不知伊的消息了，昨天Ｗ君忽然提及伊，説伊不但做了人家的妻子，而且已是人子的母親了。而我經過了這幾年社會的磨折，吃花生米的癖好也没有了，確有些使人······</p>

<p>Hetian Can Be Taken in a Matter of Days</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Third Route Army recovered Shicheng County on the morning of the 6th of this month, capturing countless prisoners, which are currently being accounted for. The entire Third Army Corps of the bandits and the Fifteenth Division of the pseudo-First Army Corps fled west of Shicheng in a panic. Our army is still pursuing and suppressing them. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) According to recent intelligence from the border between Jiangxi and Fujian: A, After the Pseudo-Third Army Corps and the 15th Division of the Pseudo-First Army Corps were defeated in Yiqian, they retreated to the deep mountains south of Yiqian, utilizing the complex terrain there to construct broad and deep, imbricated lines of fortifications, attempting to resist stubbornly. Since the 26th, after being pursued and suppressed by our Third Route Army in conjunction with the air force, they were eventually crushed and broken by us, with bandits killed everywhere. On the morning of the 6th, our army won another victory, occupying Shicheng County. The remaining bandits then fled in a panic to the area west of Shicheng. According to reports, countless prisoners were captured in this battle, with the total number of casualties on the bandit side estimated at more than 6,000. B, Currently, our □ Column has defeated the main force of the Pseudo-First Army Corps and the 13th Division of the Pseudo-Fifth Army Corps, occupying Gaoxingxu, about 30 li north of Xingguo. The Pseudo-Ninth Army Corps and the Pseudo-Twenty-Fourth Division, which were entrenched at Baiyiyangling, the only barrier to Changting, have been defeated by our □ Column and are approaching Hetian. Therefore, both Changting and Xingguo can be taken soon. C, According to recent surrenders by the former commander of the Pseudo-Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Military Region and commander of the Pseudo-Sixth Army Corps, Kong Helong, and the current commander of the Fourth Division of the Pseudo-Third Army Corps, Zhang Yi, a graduate of the 21st class of the Japanese Military Academy, the bandit army has suffered heavy casualties in recent successive attacks by the National Army. The prime-age men in the bandit areas have been almost completely conscripted, and the newly supplemented bandit soldiers are mostly old and weak. In addition, there is a growing shortage of materials in the bandit areas, and complaints are now widespread. The bandits have reached the end of their rope and will soon be eliminated. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Wang Jialie telegraphed on the 26th, saying that since the bandits led by Xiao Ke were surrounded and attacked by the Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou armies in Dawang and Xiaoguangwei on the border of Jinping and Jianhe last month, they fled in disarray towards Baguahe. When they reached Douwu, which belongs to Jianhe County, they were again pursued and suppressed by the armies of our three provinces and are currently still engaged in fierce fighting. Because of the extreme lack of food, the bandits sent hundreds of bandits to征發 food in the Wazhai area of Sansui, but they were intercepted by our army and militia and fled back to Douwu. Currently, a certain unit of the Guizhou army and a certain unit of our Guizhou army have surrounded Douwu from Dawang and Xiaoguang. Another unit of our Seventh Route Army is attacking the bandits from Wazhai and is also engaged in fierce fighting. He is currently personally leading his units down the Qingjiang River to flank them, in order to eliminate them in one fell swoop. It has been found that the bandits have suffered heavy losses in Guizhou due to successive encirclements and suppressions. They attempted to cross the Zhenyuan River by stealth, but were unsuccessful. Now that they are under attack from all sides, it is expected that they can be completely resolved, and so on. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Xiao Zhiping电云, "This division was ordered to attack the area of Shakenao and Lanpo in Xianchen to take Gaoxingxu. We immediately attacked the Lion's Dam, Shakenao, Lanpo, and the highlands to the west, and after several charges, we completely occupied all those places before 10:00. Taking advantage of the victory, we continued to attack the bandits at Niugudong, Yangweidong, and Zhugaoshan. The bandits resisted stubbornly based on fortifications, but our officers and soldiers fought bravely and fiercely, and finally occupied more than 30 bandit forts in succession. The bandits collapsed and fled in a panic to the southwest highlands of Zhugaoshan. This division has completely accomplished its mission. In this battle, we killed 400-500 bandits, captured about 200 bandit officers and soldiers, and seized 150 rifles," and so on. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Necessity of Improving Silk, Jing <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>China's silk industry is affected by the low price of silk and the stagnation of exports, and internally困厄 by the weak domestic consumption power and small market. As a result, less than 10% of the more than 110 silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are in operation. Looking ahead, it is not only worrying for the young industry, but it is also related to the entire national economy. The foreign raw silk market originally</p>
<p>thought that China was the only one. Unfortunately, most domestic companies follow the same old methods and lack long-term vision. They have failed to carefully investigate what the consumer market likes and what can be improved in technology. They only use the inherent methods and ordinary products, letting people buy them as they please. This may have been possible in the era of handicrafts when competition was not fierce, but in today's competitive silk industry, Japanese merchants are doing their best to improve their products to suit the needs of the United States. China's overseas market has gradually been invaded by them.</p>
<p>gradually retreated to an inferior position. After the economic panic occurred in 1929, the signs of decline became even more obvious. In 1932, the export of raw silk and silk fabrics was worth 82 million yuan. In 1933, the export was only worth more than 74 million yuan. The decline rate was about 9%. From the current situation, the lack of exports this year is likely to be even more serious than in the past.</p>
<p>The decline of the domestic market and the low consumption power of the general society are general phenomena. However, the silk industry is particularly obvious. The largest消场 in a country is mostly in small and medium-sized cities and rural areas. Large cities are ultimately a minority. Yes</p>
<p>With the poor market, it progresses with the decline of the countryside. This situation is inherently difficult to remedy artificially. However, the silk industry also has its own undeniable weaknesses. In terms of silk itself, people generally criticize silk fabrics as not being durable and easily stained. The elasticity is extremely small, and the insulation is not as good as woolen fabrics. There is some truth in this statement. However, silk fabrics do have special advantages. (1) Silk clothing is shiny and durable. (2) It is not afraid of moth damage when stored. However, because the price is too high, at a time when the general economy is extremely poor, it is difficult to compare with cheap cotton fabrics. What is most worrying is that more and more foreign goods are imported. At any time and anywhere, they are strong competitors in the market. The artificial silk fabrics. The more sophisticated the technology, the cheaper the price is, almost equal to cotton fabrics. The styles can compete with real silk. Under this situation, without improvement, the future of the silk industry is very dangerous. As for the way to improve, it is impossible to compete with cotton fabrics. But at least it must be based on woolen fabrics and find a way to overcome them.</p>
<p>The reason why silk fabrics cannot compete with woolen fabrics is that they are considered too thin. They cannot be made into suits or military uniforms. Now, the improvement of Niu silk and silk fabrics should not only focus on high-end goods and women's clothes, but also study how silk fabrics can replace woolen fabrics, and promote general use to establish a solid foundation for the domestic market. At the same time, find ways to develop overseas. If you can weave thick silk, even if you raise the price to more than twice the market price at the time, you don't have to worry about not finding a market. Because it is durable, it can be compared with woolen fabrics. As for the insulation layer, it is indeed a practical problem that cannot be improved. However, we all know that silk cotton is warm and no less than woolen fabrics. However, because it is soft, the clothes are not flat and the elasticity is too large, it seems not suitable for short clothes. If modern scientific methods can be used well and proper pressure is applied, it may also avoid the disadvantages of clumsiness. Then the use of silk cotton in winter is lighter and warmer than fur. Furthermore, the reform of silk velvet is also a method. Now the improvement of silk fabrics is indeed very hard, and the products are quite excellent. However, the focus seems to be only on aesthetics, and practicality is ignored. If the previous concepts are changed, giving up aesthetics and making thickness and durability the first priority, then the use of silk velvet instead of thick呢 may be popularized throughout the country. In short, to improve the silk industry, on the one hand, we should focus on silk fabrics themselves, and even more, we must gather the strength of the entire silk industry and add national assistance, then the difficulties will not be difficult to overcome.</p>

<p>Madrid: The central government appears to have suppressed the nationwide rebellion today, but there are still problems in Asturias.

Provincial Governor Companys and other leading figures were arrested. Former Prime Minister Azaña narrowly escaped. Shortly thereafter, troops in Girona mutinied. General Batet rushed to command the suppression of the rebellion. Fierce fighting is said to be underway. The Lerroux government has dispatched the entire navy here. (National Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>Madrid: After General Batet occupied the Catalan independent government with swift action, the central army's superiority has been confirmed. Those arrested in the Catalan provisional government will be brought in for trial within 24 hours. The sudden turn of events was not expected by the pro-independence faction. Originally, the Madrid government relied on the Civil Guard, and many Civil Guard generals had sworn allegiance to the new republic. However, General Batet considered the independent government illegal and ordered his regular troops to open fire on the independent government, shooting for half an hour. He then ordered a ceasefire and prepared to negotiate with the independent government, but Companys misunderstood the true situation and demanded that Batet surrender instead. Batet then mobilized heavy artillery to bombard them, and Companys eventually surrendered due to being no match. (National Telegram on the 7th)</p>

<p>Azaña as Chairman of the Provisional Government</p>
<p>Spain Immediately Declares Martial Law Nationwide</p>
<p>Madrid – Catalonia Province has formally announced its secession from the Spanish Republic and declared independence. The red revolution in Asturias Province continues. Spain declared martial law nationwide at 11 o'clock last night. The Free State of Catalonia was proclaimed at 8 o'clock last night by the President of the Provincial Assembly, Companys. Companys issued a declaration in Barcelona, the provincial capital of Catalonia, stating that the provisional government would be formed by former electoral manager Azaña and other left-wing Republicans and would not recognize the authority of the central government in Madrid. Troops loyal to the government, under the command of General Batet, immediately launched an attack on the separatists after the declaration was issued, resulting in fierce fighting in the streets of Barcelona and throughout Catalonia throughout the night. Casualties on both sides were heavy. News this morning is very confused, with both sides claiming victory. However, at 6:30 AM, it was reported that Companys' forces had collapsed, the war had ceased, and the independence movement had been suppressed. At the same time, it was announced here that the Spanish Navy had sent a telegram expressing its obedience to the central government, stating that it was sailing to Barcelona to help quell the unrest. The warships are expected to arrive there this afternoon. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Barcelona – At 8:17 this evening, the President of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, Companys, delivered a declaration to the public from the balcony of the Provincial Government Office, saying, "People of Catalonia, the monarchists and pan-nationalists have now seized power and will destroy the republican system in Spain. The republican system is now in danger. All those who firmly believe in the republican system must rise up to prevent its destruction. Catalonia cannot shirk its duty and must act in unison with the entire people of Spain to fight for freedom. The Catalan government hereby announces the severance of all relations with the current government of Spain and declares the establishment of the 'Free State of Catalonia within the Iberian Federal Republic.' At this critical time, the political power of Catalonia is now held separately by the People's Assembly and the government." Companys further stated, "At this very serious moment, I now ask all people to abide by discipline. Any violations will be punished by the government without leniency. Long live Catalonia, long live freedom!" The crowd cheered loudly at Companys' declaration. The Director of Education, Gassol, then spoke, asking the public not only to support the government verbally but also to provide a solid backing to the government with their actions. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Barcelona – Early this morning, Catalonia declared itself a republic, named the "Catalan State of the Spanish Federal Republic," and will soon appoint former Socialist Prime Minister Azaña as chairman and establish a provisional government in Barcelona. It will also declare the Lerroux cabinet as an illegal government. Before Catalonia declared itself a republic, the public was extremely excited, marching in groups through the city, carrying flags with slogans such as "Down with Lerroux" and "Demand the Establishment of a Catalan Republic." The Labor Confederation issued an article demanding the immediate declaration of a Catalan Republic. President Companys has issued a declaration establishing a republic at the government building and stated the Catalan government's intention to defend the republic and sever relations with the institutions controlling Spain. Companys also stated that the government has declared Catalonia as a free state within the Iberian Federal Republic. Immediately after the declaration, a Catalan lawyer, in the name of the Free State of Catalonia, took over the courts.</p>
<p>Many women are actively participating in the revolutionary movement in the Barcelona area. Two were arrested for carrying bombs. Machine guns have been placed at key points in the city, and cavalry and open trucks full of soldiers are patrolling the streets. All public transport has been withdrawn. The police have requisitioned many buses and private cars. Only food stores are open, and everyone is stocking up on food to prevent strikers from preventing food from entering the city. However, food delivery vehicles are allowed to move within the city limits, but food trucks from the countryside are not allowed to enter the city. If this matter is not resolved by Sunday, the city's food supply will be critically short.</p>
<p>In Madrid, Prime Minister Lerroux announced a state of martial law on the radio, stating that this step had to be taken because of the Catalan government's declaration of independence. He asked the people to unite in support of the government, saying that Spain would eventually be united as one body. He also stated that the revolutionary actions are limited to the provinces of Catalonia and Asturias. Interior Minister Vallguera also broadcast the martial law regulations on the radio, including a clause requisitioning freight vehicles, private cars, and motor vehicles, stating that vehicle owners must not use them without the permission of the authorities. The food situation in Madrid is also very serious, and the lack of workers is worrying. Last night, more and more people gathered outside bakeries, waiting for a long time without dispersing. There were rumors last night that employees of the subway had been dismissed, and it is possible that a whole new crew will be recruited today to replace them.</p>
<p>The parliament has been scheduled to convene on October 9. The government plans to propose the restoration of the death penalty, the abolition of the strike law, and the supply of arms to civilians. It is claimed that the government intends to emphasize humanitarianism on the one hand and strictly suppress the rebellion on the other. Anyone who attacks or attempts to attack the police will be shot.</p>
<p>Although the situation in the capital has become relatively stable, fighting broke out again last night. Battles in Bilbao, Baracaldo, and Rianxo have also resumed. It is reported that the Communists have completely occupied the town of Lemos. The strike fever has now spread throughout the country, especially in the provinces of Valencia, Málaga, and Alicante.</p>
<p>The rebels in the Permo area declared the Basque Republic and raised a red flag on the city hall, but it was immediately taken down by the police, and order was restored.</p>
<p>Last night, when the Spanish government held an important meeting to discuss the overall situation, mortars and machine guns were placed outside the door. After the meeting, the Minister of the Interior told a Reuters reporter that the revolutionary movement in Asturias Province had completely ended and that the government troops stationed there were very strong and there was no fear of further incidents.</p>
<p>The fighting in the eastern suburbs of Madrid last night was reportedly instigated by the Anarchist Federation. It is now known that two people died.</p>
<p>Before dusk, in a semi-residential area somewhere in the Spanish capital, a boy with his hands in his pockets was walking and whistling, looking very relaxed. Suddenly, he stopped, pulled out a pistol, aimed at the chest of a police sergeant, and fired, killing him. Then he calmly escaped. Several other innocent people died, including a 14-year-old boy on his way from home to school, a young girl, and a worker whose name is unknown, all of whom were killed by stray bullets in the street. Several children who were shopping with their mothers were also seriously injured. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>Provincial Government Office Captured Within One Hour</p>
<p>Separatist Government Raises White Flag to Surrender</p>
<p>Barcelona – Central government troops began attacking the Catalan Provincial Government Office and the former Provincial Governor's Office at 5:00 AM, because the Catalan independent government was working inside the Provincial Government Office, and the Director of Internal Affairs was working in the former Provincial Governor's Office. Initially, the central government troops occupied the houses and strategic locations around the two offices, and then gathered to fire at the two offices. The revolutionary government also fired back from inside the offices. Bullets rained down in front of the offices, causing heavy losses. At 6:00 AM, the President of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, Companys, began to surrender to General Batet, the commander of the central army. Companys reported to the public via radio at 6:15 AM. Thereupon, the central army occupied the two offices, and the arrested rebels were all taken to the Catalonia Army Headquarters for detention. Inside the Provincial Government Office, a Catalan guard, on Companys' order, raised a white flag on the roof when he was shot and killed. In addition, several others were injured. (Havas News Agency Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Madrid – Central government troops in Catalonia Province, under the command of General Batet, began shelling the Provincial Government Office with artillery, where the revolutionary government had been meeting. The Provincial Government Office had a broadcasting system, which Provincial Governor Companys had used to broadcast speeches, urging the people to resist the central government. Therefore, the troops focused on destroying this part when they fired. The Director of Internal Affairs of the Provincial Government urged Catalan farmers to arm themselves to protect the revolutionary government. General Batet has occupied the civilian airfield. Radio stations in Barcelona are constantly broadcasting speeches, urging the people to arm themselves to protect the Free State of Catalonia. According to the latest news, the Catalan revolutionary government has surrendered. The troops fired several shells at the areas where the autonomous faction and commercial and industrial employees were concentrated. Several warships have sailed from Cartagena to Barcelona. Two battalions of the Spanish Foreign Legion have crossed the sea from Ceuta, Africa, to Gibraltar and will sail to Barcelona. The government has sent troops to Asturias, where the rebels are unable to resist. The Provincial Government issued an official report stating that the Governor of Catalonia Province, in order to avoid bloodshed and futile resistance, has surrendered to General Batet. This news has been notified to the governors of all provinces. (Havas News Agency Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>However, Most of the Key Figures Escape</p>
<p>More Than Thirty People Died in the Conflict</p>
<p>Barcelona – The President of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, Companys, announced to all the people of Catalonia via radio at 6:15 this morning: "In order to avoid sacrificing lives, I have to surrender to General Batet." Currently, Companys himself, all members of the autonomous province, as well as the mayor of Barcelona and members of the city council, have been arrested. Many other key figures have escaped, especially Batia, a member of the Catalan Youth League, who was one of the main instigators of this coup. Gunfire can still be heard in many places in the city, but it has gradually become sparse. The rebels in various places have been cut off from contact and are still fighting the troops like cornered beasts, but their resistance will soon be extinguished. It is also said that when the Provincial Government officials were arrested, most of them did not resist at all. Traffic in the streets is still dangerous, so it is not easy to obtain accurate information. The exact number of casualties in this conflict is also unknown, but the number of deaths should not be too high. When the government troops besieged, they fired many shots at the Provincial Government Office, the Mayor's Office, and the central area where commercial and industrial employees gathered, and the resistance in the central area of the employees was the most intense. Although the main base of the rebels has been captured, the peace of the riots still needs to go through several sporadic battles, especially in the city of Barcelona, because this is where the extremist factions are concentrated. However, the subsequent battles are only the epilogue of the whole drama and are not worthy of importance, because the central government has already achieved absolute victory.

<p>Barcelona – Former President of the Catalonia Provincial Government, Companys, other Provincial Government officials, and their guards were arrested this morning and escorted away from the Provincial Government Office by the troops. A large number of other people have been arrested. Gunfire continued to be heard in various parts of the city until noon. It is estimated that more than thirty people have died.

<p>Lerroux Announces to the Public</p>
<p>That He Has Been Able to Control the Situation</p>
<p>Madrid – The Spanish government has been very busy transporting troops in the past two days, hoping to put down the revolutionary movement. The most intense revolutionary trends are in the provinces of Catalonia and Asturias. Early this morning, two infantry battalions were ordered to immediately set off for Barcelona. At the same time, five warships, running at full speed, arrived in Barcelona in the afternoon, clearing the decks and preparing for battle. The military appearance was quite impressive, and the residents were frightened. Batet, the commander of the central government troops stationed in Catalonia, sent an ultimatum to Companys at midnight, instructing him to surrender immediately, otherwise he would bombard the Barcelona Administrative Office. After General Batet issued this letter, he transferred troops to the civilian airfield, placed field artillery, and aimed at the Administrative Office. Because Companys resisted and refused to obey, the artillery fired, and machine guns also fired in succession, causing considerable damage. Thereupon, Companys announced his surrender.</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Interior received the news of Companys' surrender, it was greatly excited. All the cabinet members waited in the Ministry of Interior all night to wait for news of the situation in Barcelona. Hearing this good news, they were greatly encouraged and all jumped up and shouted, "Long live Spain, long live the Republic!" The government later announced that the situation in Asturias was also under control. The government has sent troops from Valencia to the trouble spots.</p>
<p>All the main figures of the Catalan government, except for Internal Affairs Minister Dencàs, have been arrested. As for the fate of Azaña, it is currently unknown. It is reported that 15 people were injured when the government office was attacked, including Companys. In addition, there were 50 other injuries. It is now heard that the President of Spain, Zamora, personally interceded for Companys after Companys was arrested, so Companys was spared from being immediately submitted to a military tribunal. Companys had rejected two ultimatums. Because the central army commander Batet did not see the first ultimatum being accepted, he ordered the troops to fire with Lebel rifles for half an hour. The second ultimatum was still ineffective, so heavy artillery and machine guns opened fire and engaged. Before long, Companys surrendered. A cabinet meeting will be held today to decide whether Companys should be handed over to a military court or to the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal for trial.</p>
<p>This afternoon, Spanish Prime Minister Lerroux spoke to the cheering crowds from the balcony of the Ministry of Interior, saying that the unrest in Catalonia and Asturias was completely under control. According to the latest news, government troops and rebels are still fighting in the suburbs of Barcelona, but it is expected that government troops will be able to clear everything up within 24 hours. When the rebels attacked the naval and air force bases in Barcelona, a fierce battle broke out, killing 20 and injuring 70. There are now several provinces where the war has not yet ended.

<p>Milan – Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech here tonight to 200,000 Italian people, stating that Italy and France have concluded an agreement, which may be signed at the end of October or the beginning of November. Mussolini said, "The relationship between us and France has greatly improved. The atmosphere has now turned better. The agreement currently concluded is not only beneficial to the two countries, but also to the entire Europe. The development of Europe cannot do without Germany, but Germany's current policy must be changed." Mussolini also said that the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, has good intentions, but the Disarmament Conference has already been buried and cannot be revived. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Milan – Today, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech to 350,000 people in the Piazza del Duomo, explaining Italy's foreign policy, saying that we have defended and will continue to defend the independence of Austria. He continued, "Italy's policy is either friendship or war." He also said that if the news reported is true and Yugoslavia continues to harm Italy and cause pain to the heart, then there is absolutely no possibility of improving the relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia. At the same time, the history of Europe cannot imagine its development without Germany. The relations between Italy and Switzerland are extremely friendly, and the relations with France have also greatly improved. The Italian Prime Minister also mentioned the issue of disarmament, saying that according to his prediction, the countries concerned may be able to reach some concrete opinions before November, and said that if justice can promote peace, then we are willing to decorate our rifles with olive branches. If peace cannot be obtained, we will decorate our guns with bayonets and new victories. The Italian Prime Minister's speech clearly indicated that a compromise has not yet been reached between Italy and France, but the Italian Prime Minister hopes that French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to Rome at the end of this month may have important developments.

<p>is not a crisis of civilization, but a process of civilization moving from one stage to another. At this time of the collapse of the old system, there are only two solutions: one is to nationalize the entire national economy, and the other is to implement a professional combination system to allow all production factors in the country to join the combination. The former would increase the number of national employees tenfold, so it was rejected. Only the latter is the most logical solution, and its purpose is to achieve the highest social justice, in other words, to ensure that people have job security, adequate wages, and a comfortable life. In short, if the 19th century was the century of omnipotent capital, then this century should be the period of omnipotent labor and sacred labor." When mentioning foreign policy, he said, "We have defended Austria's independence, which Prime Minister Dollfuss exchanged for blood, and we will continue to defend it in the future. Those who say that Italy intends to make Austria its protectorate are either intentionally lying or are wrong. Although I recognize the development of history, it is impossible to disregard Germany. However, German people should not be given the impression that Germany wants to isolate itself from the unity of Europe." When Mussolini mentioned that the relationship between Italy and France will improve day by day in the future, the audience applauded greatly. Thereupon, the Prime Minister said again, "The coordination we hope for, if it can be realized, will not only greatly benefit France and Italy, but also greatly benefit European peace. And at a time when the Disarmament Conference is on the verge of bankruptcy, the improvement of relations between various nations is especially necessary. Henderson, although trying to revive the dying Disarmament, unfortunately, this sick man has long been buried under the pressure of battleships and cannons. Therefore, you should not be surprised by the military training of the people." The conclusion is that we can certainly not make predictions that are too far away, but it is inevitable that pan-fascism will become the civilization model of this world. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>What Flag to Raise Becomes a Problem</p>
<p>(London) Since Greek Princess Marina became engaged to British Prince George, she will soon formally visit the British King and Queen. However, British officials are still hesitant and unable to decide what flag to raise when the princess arrives, because the princess currently has no nationality. If the blue and white flag of the former Greek royal family is raised, the British government currently has friendly relations with the Greek Republic. Although the princess's ancestors were Russian, the Russian eagle flag or the hammer and sickle flag cannot be raised immediately. Or, because the princess has relatives in Denmark, the Danish flag can be raised. However, it is likely that the princess's post-marriage nationality will be assumed in advance, and the British flag will be raised directly. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The newspaper Izvestia, regarding the publication of political pamphlets by the Japanese military, pointed out that the Japanese military is relying on this to lead the entire Japanese military-fascist movement and that the appearance of this pamphlet may also reflect internal conflicts among the leaders of the military. At the same time, this move is also an attempt by the military to explore the national psychological orientation. The newspaper continued, "In order to prepare for the naval conference, the Japanese military wants to make the national finances extra tight in order to realize its plan to greatly expand armaments. On the other hand, the compromise proposal put forward by Army Minister Hayashi to reorganize the administration of Manchuria and replace General Hishikari with a 'peaceful' soldier is also an expression of the military's fear that the current situation is too bad."</p>

<h3 id="e60">Shi Cantang, the Bombing Suspect of the First Through Train to Shenyang from Beiping, Sentenced to Death <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>His Demeanor Was Calm Before the Execution, and Spectators Pitied Him</p>
<p>The Zhengyi Assassination Group Was Headed by Shi Cantang</p>
<p>Five Suspects Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: At 8:45 a.m. on July 1, the first direct through train to Shenyang from Beiping departed from Beiping. At 1:20 p.m. that afternoon, a violent explosive device exploded in the third-class carriage near Chadian Station, resulting in the deaths of dozens of innocent passengers, with both deaths and injuries. After the incident, the authorities ordered their subordinates to strictly apprehend the main culprits who deliberately sabotaged the railway. As a result, the Third Regiment of the Central Military Police and the Beiping Public Security Bureau arrested five people, including Shi Cantang, Cao Wensheng, Pan Jun, Tang Pu, and Yuan Binxia. After investigation, Shi confessed to being the mastermind behind the incident, and the rest were suspects. The military branch sentenced Shi to capital punishment in accordance with the "Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China". This morning (the 6th) at 9:30 a.m., Shi was escorted to Tianqiao and executed by shooting. The details of the incident are recorded below.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Execution: The Third Regiment of the Central Military Police this morning (the 6th) at 9:40 a.m. escorted Shi Cantang, the main culprit of the Chadian train bombing, from the regiment headquarters in Qianliang Hutong. Led by Regiment Deputy Yuan Jiapei, a platoon of military police officers drove in two new-style purple cars to the Tianqiao execution ground to carry out the execution. Because the case was extremely secret beforehand, few people knew about it. It was not until the police of the Outer Fifth District and the security police of the Fourth Team were on alert at Erdaotan that merchants and residents near Tianqiao began to gather at the execution ground to watch. At 9:20 a.m., more than 40 central military police officers arrived in advance by car to guard the area and drive away the spectators, which was even more serious than the situation of previous executions of criminals. The soldiers and police held guns and live ammunition in their hands, ready to shoot. At about 10 o'clock, a 1934 new purple car and a green car drove to the execution ground. The first to get out of the car were the military police, and finally, the train bomber Shi Cantang was taken out of the purple car. Shi was about twenty years old, with slicked-back hair, wearing a moon-white gown and Western-style trousers. From a distance, he looked like a handsome young man. After the criminal got out of the car, two military police officers held his arms on the left and right. Shi's demeanor was calm. On the way, he nodded and smiled slightly at the onlookers on the left and right. The onlookers all sighed with regret. Suddenly, they heard the supervising officer Yuan Jiapei shouting "Stop!" The criminal Shi knelt down facing south. After three gunshots, he was lying in a pool of blood. Later, because Shi's body was still shaking, the executing military police fired another shot at his body before he died completely. Shi's body was then buried by laborers in a mass grave outside Yongdingmen.</p>
<p>Recalling the Train Bombing: The through train to Shenyang from Beiping began operation on July 1 this year. The first train departing from Beiping included three first-class carriages, one second-class carriage, four third-class carriages, one guard car, and one baggage car, all of which were rolling stock from the Beining Railway, hauled by locomotive number 2189. The train captain was Zhou Dechang, the guard car attendant was Song Ziguang, the ticket inspectors were Wang Wenwei, Li Yufeng, and Liu Zhenze. On that day, the passengers departing from Beiping included 73 third-class passengers and 2 second-class passengers. At 1:20 p.m., when passing near Chadian Station, the second third-class car behind the locomotive suddenly exploded with a loud bang, and the tragedy began. Five male and female passengers died on the spot, and 27 were slightly or seriously injured. The next day, leaflets were found in Beiping, stating the motives for the train bombing, and some people indirectly warned the news media not to speak for the officials. After the police and military police authorities were ordered to strictly apprehend the culprits, Li Cantang and others were successively arrested on September 2. Shi was sentenced to death as the mastermind. Shi was from Liyang, Jiangsu, and was only in his early twenties. A few months ago, the author who used the pen name "Moron" in the supplements of various newspapers in Beiping was this gentleman.</p>
<p>The Course of Solving the Case: After Shi was executed, the authorities announced the course of solving the case as follows: (1) Previously, the Third Regiment of the Military Police arrested Cao Wensheng, a member of the "Zhengyi Assassination Group," and several suspects, including Pan Jun, Yuan Baoxia, and Tang Pu, in this city, and seized documents and explosives from the assassination group. During the interrogation, they learned that the Chadian train bombing was carried out by Shi Cantang, the leader of the assassination group. The Third Regiment of the Military Police then carried out extensive investigations and arrested Shi Cantang on September 2. After interrogation, Shi Cantang directly admitted that the "Zhengyi Assassination Group" was organized by him, and that the Chadian train bombing was carried out by him personally. The "Letter to Chadian Station" and the "Letter to the People of the Whole Country" were also written by him; (2) Shi Cantang learned that the through train to Shenyang from Beiping was about to be implemented, so he planned the train bombing plan, put a large amount of explosives into a thermos bottle to avoid inspection, and took it to Tianjin on June 30. After installing the explosive detonator, he took the first through train to Shenyang from Beiping on July 1 from Tianjin, and then placed the thermos bottle filled with explosives in the third-class carriage. Shi got off the train at Tanggu Station and returned to Beiping. When the through train arrived at Chadian Station, it was bombed; (3) After the Third Regiment of the Military Police learned the truth of the case, it reported the results of the interrogation to the military branch for review, considering the seriousness of the case. Now the military branch believes that at a time when the local area is unstable, Shi Cantang dared to organize an assassination group and use explosives to destroy railway transportation, resulting in the tragic deaths of many passengers. He is extremely illegal and has been sentenced to death to Shi Cantang to warn others. The members of his assassination group, Cao Wensheng, etc., were also sentenced to imprisonment according to law. Yesterday (the 6th) morning at 10 o'clock, the Second Regiment of the Military Police took Shi Cantang to verify his identity and sent Wu Tuan to escort him to the Tianqiao execution ground to carry out the shooting.</p>
<p>Proclamation of the Military Branch: Proclamation of the Beiping Branch of the Military Commission of the National Government, Zhengfa Zi No. 2, regarding the proclamation: It is reported that the Third Regiment of the Military Police has successively arrested Shi Cantang, the perpetrator of the Chadian train bombing on the Beining Road, and five suspects, Cao Wensheng, Pan Jun, Tang Pu, and Yuan Baoxia. After interrogation, it has been clarified that the perpetrator Shi Cantang is the mastermind and perpetrator of the Chadian train bombing, and all the bombing plans were conceived by him, and he issued the "Letter to Chadian Station" and the "Letter to the People of the Whole Country", which is true. Considering that it was the beginning of the operation of the through train to Shenyang from Beiping, the perpetrator Shi Cantang recklessly used explosives to destroy the railway, resulting in the injury and death of many passengers. Such disturbance of public order is extremely sinful and should be punished with the death penalty in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the "Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China". Cao Wensheng, Pan Jun, Tang Pu, Yuan Baoxia, and the other four have also been sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment according to law, and handed over to the prison for execution and temporary custody for further investigation. In addition to taking the perpetrator Shi Cantang to the execution ground to verify his identity and sending personnel to escort him to the execution ground to carry out the shooting, in order to uphold the law and warn others, this proclamation is hereby issued to inform all the people. Chairman Jiang Zhongzheng, acting He Yingqin, October 6, 23rd year of the Republic of China (6th).</p>
<h3 id="e61">Notorious Bandit Executed in Eastern Shandong <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Wang Zimei and Four Others</p>
<p>Repeatedly Kidnapped in Various Counties in Jiaodong</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Bandit leaders Wang Cheng from Laiyang County and Pingdu County, previously gathered dozens of people and kidnapped and extorted ransoms in Pingdu, Laiyang, Jimo, Zhucheng, Rizhao, and Haiyang, and cruelly killed innocent people. There were numerous cases and repeated attempts to arrest them failed. The bandits recently sneaked into Qingdao City again, intending to engage in activities. Due to improper secrecy, they were arrested by the Public Security Bureau and the Marine Corps one after another and sentenced to death. It is found that bandit Wang is from Laiyang County, 23 years old. Two years ago, he carried a handgun and sneaked into Qingdao, and flaunted his wealth in Pingkangli and various theaters, attracting attention. He was arrested by the Public Security Bureau and sent to the court. At that time, because the bandit changed his name and refused to tell the truth, the court only sentenced him to six months imprisonment according to the regulations for banning the private possession of military weapons. After being released from prison, the bandit resumed his old business and committed numerous crimes in Jimo and Pingdu counties. Last month, he sneaked into Qingdao again and gathered party members, intending to kidnap people in Laiyang County, and purchased handguns, leather bags, and bullet belts in Qingdao in advance for use in the countryside. Unexpectedly, due to improper secrecy, the Third Fleet Command and the Public Security Bureau learned about it. When the bandit passed through Liuting, the Second Battalion of the Marine Corps detained the car, and bandit Wang and his accomplice Gan Xixian were arrested on the spot, and gun bags and other items were found. Gong Shunyi, a bandit collaborator, was also arrested east of Jimo City, and a handgun and a large number of bullets were found in Gong's home. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau also sent police to the station and pier to conduct a strict search, and arrested four bandits, Wang Qingfu, Wang Xinxi, Lu Defeng, and Zhang Yuandong, because they knew that the bandit leader had been arrested and planned to take trains and ships to flee to other ports. Another escaped bandit, Sun Kuiwu, fled to Laiyang County and was arrested by the garrison. The Qingdao Public Security Bureau sent personnel to bring bandit Sun back to the city for repeated interrogation. The bandits confessed to the kidnapping. The Pingdu and Laiyang County governments both sent official documents proving the bandits' crimes in their respective counties, requesting that they be sentenced to capital punishment to uphold the law. Subsequently, the Qingdao Naval Office sent personnel to interrogate, recorded the confessions and reported them to the Weihai Third Fleet Command, which pronounced the sentence on October 27. Except for Zhang Yuandong, Lu Shunyi, and Gan Xixian, whose circumstances were relatively minor and sentenced to imprisonment, and sent to Licun Fifth Prison for execution, Wang Chengmei, Wang Qingfu, Sun Kuiwu, Wang Xinxi, and Lu Defeng, repeatedly kidnapped people for ransom and committed heinous crimes, and were sentenced to death together. After receiving the order, the Qingdao Naval Office, together with the Public Security Bureau, sent military police to escort the five criminals, Wang Chengmei and others, to the No. 5 Battery execution ground this morning (the 5th) at 9 a.m. to carry out the shooting.

<p>Water Level Exceeds This Year's Maximum Flood Level</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: As the end of the autumn flood season approaches, there has been excessive rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. On the 2nd and 3rd, water levels were reported to be rising everywhere. The flow rate at Tongguan reached 10,000 cubic meters per second, and on the 3rd, the water level exceeded this year's maximum flood level. Chen Ruzhen, director of the Provincial River Affairs Bureau, together with technician Tao Shuceng, went to Liuyuan, Heigang, Zhongmu, Zhengzhou, and Rongze on the morning of the 3rd to inspect the engineering defenses. They returned to the province at 6 p.m. and discussed the situation of each project as follows: (1) The water level at Rongze Flood Control is 1.07 meters higher than the flood on August 11.

<h3 id="e63">Huang Yaoting, a Prominent Figure in the Beiping Pawnshop Industry, Commits Suicide <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Owned More Than a Dozen Pawnshops at His Peak</p>
<p>Suffered Social and Economic Impacts, Leading to Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Six years ago, due to the fact that the Central Government's orders were most concentrated here, many great merchants and wealthy entrepreneurs pursued one-tenth of the profits, started businesses, and held the economic reins in this five-capital city. In the past, society praised those who described their successful and wealthy attributes with their occupations, such as the Zhong Yang family, the Gong Wang family, the Huang Dang family, and the Wen Ma family. Although today many have become the decline of noble families, in the prosperous times of the Qing Dynasty, they were all like the wealthy and powerful in the capital, known to all, and enjoyed more pleasure than the emperors of the world. (The Zhong Yang family started with clocks, the Gong Wang family became wealthy by selling offerings of New Year's candies, and the Wen Ma family in Qinlao Hutong made their fortune by selling cultural relics, antiques, and calligraphy and paintings. The Huang Dang family specialized in clothing pawnshops. In Beiping's customs, those who associated their occupation with their surname to form a nickname were definitely the giants in this occupation. The meaning is like the American titles of "Oil King," "Car King," and "News King," which are the same as their honor and prominence. Unexpectedly, this morning (the 4th) at 10 o'clock, Huang Yaoting, the owner of the so-called "Huang Dang family," the giant in the pawnshop industry, suddenly committed suicide. This is truly the sad news of the near decline of the old feudal social property class. At the same time, it can also be seen that the severe changes in the Beiping economy have presented an irresistible stage. The reporter believes that the suicide of the host,</p>
<h3 id="e64">Posthumous Photograph of Huang Yaoting, Leader of the Pawn Industry in Beiping, Nicknamed "Huang of the Pawnshops" <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>To represent the influential members of the wealthy society of the old capital and (leader of the pawn industry), and as this matter is also good material for those studying social problems, we made a special trip to visit and obtained the details of the process and the inside story as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Yaoting's ancestral residence was at No. 46, Jiudaowan Hutong, Beixinqiao, Beiping. Since the庚子 Boxer Rebellion, he started his business in the pawn industry. At its peak, he controlled more than a dozen pawnshops. Therefore, his family was known for its wealth. Recently, since the government moved south and commerce declined, the pawnshops owned by the Huang family could initially barely support two or three. However, in recent months, they have all closed down simultaneously, and even the livelihood of his family has fallen into poverty. Mr. Huang is already sixty years old and has been accustomed to a wealthy life. The sudden blow was unbearable. His temperament was also that of a cautious businessman who was not good at socializing. As his livelihood became strained, his social interactions became even more difficult. His son, who originally held a minor position in the military, was recently laid off. His granddaughter, whom he used to cherish like a pearl, was also expelled from Chongci Girls' High School for failing to pay her tuition. His son, named Wanduo, was already unemployed at home. As a result, father and son often had arguments. Huang, with his stubborn and old-fashioned mind, believed that his personal future had no hope due to family poverty, business failure, and his son's filial impiety. Dwelling on the past and present, he resolved to commit suicide. Yesterday (the 3rd), Mr. Huang went out and privately purchased a bottle of sleeping pills. That night, he locked himself in his room and took them. By this morning, his family was still unaware. His wife, Zhao, got up first as usual and took care of everything. When his granddaughter, Xiguang, got up, Mr. Huang was still in bed. Fortunately, Xiguang had a keen sense and thought that her grandfather usually went out for a walk at 8:00 AM. Why was he still in bed so late today? There must be a reason. So she went to her grandfather's bedroom and called him three times, but there was no response. She pushed him with her hand, but he did not move. Xiguang suddenly felt that something was wrong and cried loudly for her family to come and investigate together. They discovered the empty bottle of sleeping pills that Mr. Huang had taken. It was then determined that the head of the family had indeed committed suicide by taking poison, without any doubt. His son immediately reported to the Third District, Twelfth Section of the Public Security Bureau in the inner city and carried Mr. Huang to the nearby Daoji Hospital for emergency treatment. By 5:00 PM, he still had a slight breath, but the doctor said that he was too old and there was absolutely no hope for recovery. When the reporter was writing this manuscript late at night, he called the hospital again and was told that Mr. Huang was still unconscious and unable to speak. Based on common sense, it is feared that this pawn industry magnate, who represents the wealthy merchant class of the old capital, has no hope of survival. Miss Huang Xiguang, Huang's granddaughter, told the reporter, "I am seventeen years old and used to study at Chongci High School. Recently, I had to drop out due to family poverty. My grandfather's death was purely due to business failure, family unrest, and the inability to make a living, which led him to take this unfortunate path of no return. I regret being born into a wealthy family and not being able to relieve my elderly relative's worries with a skill. I feel ashamed and have no interest in life." The reporter visited his residence during the day. The flowers and branches were flourishing, and the utensils were clean. However, the house was in a state of disarray, truly a vivid and tragic symbol of the decline of a once-prominent family. (4th)</p>

<p>In the Xiawutu area of Huangku Township, Tinglin, at about 11:00 PM the day before yesterday, more than a dozen armed bandits suddenly broke into the home of farmer Yu Chunqiao. Yu Wensheng and Yu Yu-shi, who lived with him, were all locked in one room. They were forced to hand over money and belongings, and Yu Wensheng was beaten. Then, they searched the house and fled with their loot. They then went to the homes of He Bozhou and Gu Awu in the same area one after another to search and rob. Gu Awu resisted slightly and was beaten and injured by the bandits. He was robbed of 85 yuan in silver, clothing, and other items. He Bozhou's home was robbed of 5 yuan in silver, silver ornaments, and clothing. Yu Chunqiao's home lost three quilts, many items of clothing, several bolts of calico, and a pair of silver bracelets. Yu Wensheng's home was robbed of 15 yuan in silver and five bolts of cloth. Four robberies in a row in one night show the rampant nature of banditry.</p>

<p>In the Beishagang Bridge area of Fangtai, on the afternoon of the 4th, seven awning boats arrived, winding through the small rivers in the countryside. The wife of Wu Heting from Zhongmi Village saw several strong men on the boats landing and stealing chickens and ducks in the bamboo forest during the day. She immediately shouted to stop them, but the bandits ignored her. She urgently sounded the gong to raise the alarm. The bandits then tried to snatch the gong away. When neighboring villagers heard the alarm and responded, they hurriedly boarded their boats and headed west. Passing through Shaojia Village, Chen Ruisheng caught sight of them putting dozens of stolen chickens into cloth bags and sinking them into the river with stones. Hundreds of civilians chased them to Sanliqiao. The Fangtai branch of the Public Security Bureau also heard the news and sent police to rush to the scene. The bandits then surrendered. Six bandit boats and more than 30 male and female bandits were captured and escorted to the county government by the Public Security Bureau branch on the 5th for interrogation. As for the one boat that escaped, some said that it had 12 bandits on board and was carrying weapons. It is said that these bandits belonged to the Shuihuo Gang (Water and Fire Gang), and thefts of large numbers of chickens and ducks by them in various places have been heard of from time to time.</p>

<p>The Zhou Shugu warehouse in Hulong Street in the city suffered a burglary last month, losing more than 10,000 yuan in banknotes and silver. The county government ordered a deadline for solving the case, but it has not been solved yet. The suspects arrested by the water police have been interrogated and found to be unrelated to the case. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 5th, a traveler passing through the Meicun Bridge area outside Pingmen suddenly encountered five bandits who blocked the road and robbed him. Fortunately, the traveler shouted loudly for help, and the railway police heard the sound and rushed to the scene. The bandits then fled, and the traveler was not harmed. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 PM on the evening of the 6th, the Yongxinhe thread and rope shop at No. 19, Xiaozhu Lane, Shantang Street outside 阊 Gate, was attacked by three bandits speaking with a 客家 Hakka accent, each carrying guns. They shouted to prohibit any resistance and rushed into the shop, forcing the accountant, Zhao Jinrong, to point out where the silver was hidden. They were robbed of 70 角 in small silver coins, 21 yuan in banknotes and silver, and 12.3 yuan in large silver corner bills. They disappeared quickly. After the bandits left, the owner immediately reported to the police district and detective team in charge to pursue and arrest them. That night, the detective team sent detectives to investigate in all directions, but there was no trace of them. County Magistrate Wu paid close attention to the continuous burglaries in the city. On the 7th, he strictly ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest the main culprits in each case and punish them severely according to the law.</p>

<p>The Wu County Medical Association held a meeting at the Boxi Hospital on the afternoon of the 6th. During the meeting, an American named Lan Wanyi (transliteration) gave a lecture. She has been researching tuberculosis in the United States for more than 20 years. She invented a machine based on her research findings. Within 24 hours, using a 5% liquid, it can gradually eliminate tuberculosis bacteria. She also conducted experiments with rabbits, and the results were very satisfactory. In the United States, she has cured many people with stage 4 lung disease. She was introduced to China by a friend and will continue her research at Boxi Hospital. She is confident that she has already succeeded. If so, then this machine is truly a valuable invention in medicine.</p>

<p>The Luyoufeng sauce garden and brewery in this county is owned by the brothers Lu Boping and Lu Zhenxiu from this county. The business is prosperous. Therefore, there are as many as eight branches inside and outside the city. Zhenxiu's son, Jinlong, once worked at the Youcheng Silk Factory and Xinyuan Money Shop, and co-founded the Dingcheng Flour Mill in Beitang with Guo Jiliang and others. In recent years, Jinlong became obsessed with operating in the stock exchange, resulting in a loss of more than 2,000 yuan. The Dingcheng Flour Mill also went bankrupt because of it. The creditors sued the court for debt collection. Zhenxiu, Jinlong's father, found out about this and severely scolded Jinlong. In a fit of anger, Jinlong left home with his wife, Xu Yufen, in November of last year and stayed at the Park Hotel. Recently, his financial difficulties have become more severe, and he is surrounded by enemies. Unable to maintain his livelihood, he had thoughts of ending his life. He tried to drown himself in the river near the Beitang Fudian Temple. Fortunately, he was rescued. However, although he could not die, he still did not return to his hotel. His wife, not seeing her husband, returned home, knowing that something had changed. She searched everywhere and found Jinlong's sworn brother, Yao Yimin, and saw five suicide notes from Jinlong to his uncle Wuxiu, aunt Ding Lu, wife Xu Yufen, sworn brother Yao Yimin, and other relatives and friends. The notes stated that he would throw himself into the vast ocean and instructed his wife to take care of their children and repay her in the next life. The Lu family is now extremely anxious and is searching everywhere. It is unknown whether he can return safely.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Three Burglaries in the Second and Third Districts <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Hui Mo-biao, a resident of Zhoujing Lane North, Jinhua Lane, in the second district (Jingyun City) of the county, has a modest family fortune. He runs the Wanshunyi Southern Goods Store under Jingqiao in the Southern Gate. He has three sons and one daughter. At about 11:00 PM the night before last, five or six bandits suddenly came to the Hui family, entered through a hole dug in the empty house next door, and searched arbitrarily, each carrying a pistol and iron shovel, with painted faces. Hui's second son, A-er, heard the bandits' accent and knew that they were all locals. One of the bandits was a fellow villager named Hua Rongchu, whom A-er recognized. The bandit knew that things were not good and swung his axe at A-er. Fortunately, he dodged quickly, and only his right forehead was slightly injured. The robbery lasted for an hour before they left with their loot and fled towards the railway. Afterwards, upon inspection, it was discovered that gold, silver jewelry, clothing, and other items worth about 100 yuan had been stolen. The next day, A-er came to the city, intending to report the robbery at home to his father in the store. Unexpectedly, he ran into the bandit Hua Rongchu on a narrow road under Qingming Bridge. He immediately dragged him into the Third Branch Bureau, transferred him to the General Bureau, and then transferred him to the county government. Clerk Yu opened the court for interrogation. The criminal Hua confessed to the robbery and was ordered to be handcuffed and detained. Also, the family of Pan Rongquan in Pan Lane, the 267th and 268th districts of the Third District, was visited by five bandits the night before last. The loss from the robbery in the room was small. Because the bandits were not satisfied with their loot, they went to Zhang Gensheng's home in Zhang Lane, the 267th and 268th districts, to search and rob. They were robbed of more than 200 yuan in cash and clothing, for a total loss of more than 300 yuan.</p>

<p>The Wuyi County Anti-Smoking Association has been conducting the registration of opium addicts since its establishment. The deadline was the 30th of last month. However, because most of the district offices had not completed the follow-up procedures, a five-day extension was granted. As of the 6th, all reports have been compiled. The County Anti-Smoking Association has completed the calculation and statistics. There are 752 first-class addicts, 3,638 second-class addicts, for a total of 4,390 addicts. County Magistrate Hou estimated that there were about 15,000 opium addicts in the county during the initial investigation. Now, only one-third have registered. Some have quit voluntarily due to strict anti-smoking measures, but many have avoided registration. He has telegraphed the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association to ask for instructions on how to deal with this in the future.</p>

<p>The Kaitai Cloth Shop in front of the Gulou in Hangzhou has been in business for more than 80 years and has had annual surpluses. Manager Li Jintang has been in charge of the shop for 40 years since his father passed away. Therefore, his private property and accumulated assets are extremely rich. He also serves as the president of the Hangzhou Zhongnan Bank. This year, due to difficulties in collecting debts in the Upper River area, he suddenly entrusted a lawyer to announce the clearing of debts, totaling more than 100,000 yuan owed to various banks and money shops (only a few hundred yuan to Zhongnan) and more than 200,000 yuan to depositors. When depositors heard the news, they were greatly alarmed. The Public Security Bureau also found that the shop's accounts were inaccurate, so they summoned Li to the bureau for questioning at the request of the creditors and sent police to monitor him. The municipal government believed that this matter had a significant impact on society. In addition to ordering the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to investigate and order the shop to handle it carefully, yesterday, the Social Affairs Section summoned Li Jintang to the government to inquire about the truth and ordered him to be responsible for continuing to maintain and restore business. On the one hand, he was ordered to continue to maintain and restore business and gradually repay the depositors. It is heard that the acceptance of deposits from shops is considered inappropriate and has many abuses, and it is planned to find a way to ban it.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Liu Weichi Talks About the Recent Work of the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News reported that Liu Weichi, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, came to Shanghai on official business a few days ago. He has been staying in Shanghai for some time and has not yet returned to Beijing. A reporter from Xinsheng News visited him at his private residence yesterday and was received. He talked in detail about the recent efforts of the Ministry of Industry in various undertakings and the current implementation situation. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cotton Suppression The Ministry of Industry believes that in the past, China's cotton was not only used for domestic consumption but also for export. However, most merchants still only care about profit and do not consider the quality of cotton, so they add water and adulterate it. The Ministry of Industry entrusted the Commodity Inspection Bureau to handle this, but it was only for exports. Now, the establishment of the suppression office is for both exports and domestic sales. The Shanghai Suppression Office has started working on the 1st. It can be formally established within this week. The Ministry of Industry is negotiating with various provinces on the establishment of cotton adulteration and water addition suppression offices in various provinces. It is planned to first establish them in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other provinces. Hebei is already in progress and can be established first. The director will be concurrently held by the Director of the Construction Department of the province.</p>
<p>Various Manufacturing Plants The second thing I talked about was the various manufacturing plants planned by the Ministry of Industry. In addition to the alcohol plant, which was requested by overseas Chinese Huang Jiangquan to jointly operate with the Ministry of Industry, it was approved. The construction of the plant is progressing very quickly, and it is expected to ship goods next month. In addition, the plans for the newsprint plant have been prepared. The business side will invest 1.2 million, and the government will invest 4 million. The government's funds will be allocated and borrowed from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Conference was held in Beijing the day before yesterday. This should be decided. However, the water dam project of the paper mill needs time for surveying, but there are no other problems. In addition, the Ministry of Industry plans to set up an artificial silk manufacturing plant, but it is limited by funds. The report that silk merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang went to the Ministry of Industry to ask for instructions to jointly operate with the government is not true.</p>
<p>Relief for National Coal Recently, the Ministry of Industry plans to convene a national coal relief conference. This matter has been brewing for a long time. Because without a complete and unified plan for the relief of national coal, it cannot be put into effect. Although several large domestic coal mining companies have found ways to save themselves, it is not a universal and permanent plan after all. The Ministry of Industry has considered this matter again and again and has also sent people to various places to inspect it separately. Now the inspection reports are being compiled and will be submitted for reference at the conference. The meeting can be held this month.</p>
<p>Production Conference Regarding the National Production Conference, this was requested by the industrial circles in various places to be convened by the Ministry of Industry. The purpose is to enable the leaders and experts of the industrial circles in various places to gather together, exchange opinions, and discuss the progress of industrial production together. This meeting was originally planned to be held in July, but it was suspended due to the hot weather. Recently, it is planned to be held in November. However, the specific date is currently undecided.</p>

<p>Provinces Are Establishing Domestic Goods Companies One After Another</p>
<p>Shenshi News reported that since our country's domestic goods industry and commerce have cooperated closely with the financial community and actively implemented production and sales cooperation, the future of domestic goods is gradually becoming optimistic. A reporter from Shenshi News visited Mr. Pan Yangyao, who is familiar with the domestic goods industry. According to him, our country's domestic goods industry had a boom once during the May 30th period. In addition, it has been oppressed by the massive dumping of foreign goods and cannot raise its head. In recent years, some of our people have gradually become aware of this, and domestic goods manufacturers are also trying to promote domestic products. On the one hand, they are cooperating closely with the financial community. At the same time, manufacturers and merchants are carrying out production and sales cooperation, and the results are very good. Now, the China National Goods Company of the China Production and Marketing Cooperation Association and the National National Goods Company Office have been established in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places. In addition, Changsha, Wenzhou, Zhenjiang, Fuzhou, Shaanxi, Hankou, Nanchang, and other places have also been roughly prepared and can be formally established on a regular basis. Merchants from various provinces, such as Gansu and Yunnan, have also sent many letters welcoming domestic goods to go for promotion. It can be seen that the psychology of our people has changed, and the future of the domestic goods industry is very optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Japanese Coal Imports Have Decreased Significantly Since September 18th <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants and Factories Have Mostly Switched to Domestic Coal</p>
<p>Datong News reported that before September 18th, almost all the coal used by factories in this port was Japanese coal. As a result, the annual import volume of Japanese coal was extremely large. After September 18th, manufacturers, compelled by righteous indignation, unanimously switched to domestic coal. As a result, immature domestic coal and other types of coal have gradually developed. A reporter from Datong News learned from the Coal Industry Association that before September 18th, the Japanese coal used by various factories totaled more than 20 million yuan annually. Now, except for the factories established and manufactured by Japanese merchants in our country, the remaining Chinese merchants and factories have almost completely switched to domestic coal. According to the latest survey statistics, the monthly import of Japanese coal is about 450,000 tons, worth about 650,000 yuan in national currency. Calculating the whole year, it is only about 8 million yuan, a decrease of four-fifths compared to before. This is indeed a very good phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Public Memorial Service for Fang Shengtao Held Yesterday by All Walks of Life <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng and Other Central Representatives Attended</p>
<p>Central News reported that the late Central Committee member Fang Shengtao, a pioneer of the Kuomintang, had served in various important military and political positions. After the suppression of the Fujian Incident, he was ordered to temporarily serve as the chairman of the provincial government. After being relieved of his post, he lived in Shanghai. He passed away in Shanghai this summer. When the bad news came out, comrades at home and abroad mourned him. The Fang family held a memorial service for him yesterday at the Huzhou Club on Guizhou Road. The hall was set up on the second floor, with a sacrificial altar in the middle, hanging a portrait of Mr. Fang. The four walls were filled with elegiac couplets and white banners from important figures of the party and the country and friends of Mr. Fang. The Navy band played mournful music at the scene. Yesterday morning, those who went to pay their respects included Wu Tiecheng, the representative of the Central Party Headquarters, and Zhu Peide, Dai Ji, Zeng Zhongming, Yang Hu, Dai Shifu, and more than 100 friends of Mr. Fang.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Japanese Typhoon Affects Foreign Trade <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>But in August, Trade with China still Had a Surplus of 5.5 Million</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News on the 7th, a telegram from the Tokyo Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Japanese Commercial Counselor in this port stated that the damage caused by the wind and flood disaster in Kansai has had little impact on export industries. However, ship traffic in Osaka Port has been disrupted. Many goods in the two ports of Osaka and Kobe cannot be shipped out, and many contracts have been terminated. The biggest damage is to glass products, bicycles, electric bulbs, etc. Other enameled ironware and processed cotton cloth have also been hit considerably. It will take two months or so to restore the original state. On the other hand, among the imported goods, cotton has also suffered greatly. The damage to the quality is as high as 150,000 bales, of which 70% can still be used. Wool, raw rubber, dyes, etc. have also been damaged to varying degrees. Therefore, exports in September were 171 million, but due to the suspension of exports from Osaka Port, imports exceeded exports by 15 million. From January onwards, the cumulative excess of imports over exports was 102 million, an increase of 47% compared to the previous year. In trade with China in mid-August, exports were 14 million and exports exceeded imports by 5.57 million. From January onwards, the cumulative excess of exports over imports was 12.3 million.</p>

<p>Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association Passed a Resolution at Yesterday's Meeting</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association held a regular meeting at its office on Jiujiang Road yesterday at 1:00 PM. All committee members attended, chaired by Wu Youdan. The following important matters were resolved: (1) Regarding the Juxingcheng Bank's use of foreign capital, this association, out of prudence, had previously formed a treaty research committee to meticulously study the contract signed between the bank and the British. The treaty committee has now concluded that it is inappropriate and requested a letter be sent to advise against proceeding. The detailed report was presented to the meeting. It was resolved that, considering the current tense military situation in Sichuan due to the suppression of the Red Army, the people are in a state of uncertainty, and all production and construction are temporarily out of the question. There is no need to borrow money. A letter should be sent immediately requesting the cessation of the process and the cancellation of the agreement. (2) To maintain the current financial situation in Sichuan, it was resolved to investigate and petition the central government to confiscate funds that have recently been brought to Shanghai by active-duty military personnel and their affiliated financial staff from Sichuan Province. These funds should be used to supplement the expenses for suppressing the Red Army. This resolution was passed. (3) It was resolved to petition the government to strictly prevent the departure of family members of Sichuan military officers from Sichuan via the Yichang and Hankou routes during the tense suppression of the Red Army. Furthermore, active-duty military personnel in Sichuan should be informed that they must not use excuses to evade duty or transport their families out of Sichuan, as this would hinder the suppression of the Red Army and disrupt public morale. Violators should be punished as deserters and subject to military law. This resolution was passed. (4) It was resolved to contact fellow provincials in Hankou, Nanjing, and other capital cities to form a Red Army suppression supervision group to gather relevant materials to supplement what the government may not be aware of and to supervise the Sichuan armies in their earnest suppression efforts. This resolution was passed. (5) It was resolved to send a telegram to the Ministry of Education requesting them to inform the relevant authorities of each school to waive tuition fees or seek other effective relief measures for students from Sichuan who are studying in Shanghai and facing financial difficulties due to the high exchange rate in Sichuan. This resolution was passed. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Guowen News Agency, the manager of the Shanghai branch of Juxingcheng Bank stated that the bank's general manager, Yang Cansan, had telegraphed earlier, saying that the contract signed with the British to form the Lianyi Company stipulated a six-month period. If the agreement is not fulfilled within this time, it will be considered invalid. Two months have already passed since the signing of this contract. Considering the current situation in Sichuan, it will be difficult to pacify the region in a short period of time. Not only are the British unwilling to invest, but the bank is also unwilling to rashly make meaningless sacrifices and waste manpower and financial resources. Therefore, the bank had previously listed reasons and explained everything to the Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association, and stated that it had formally declared to the British merchant that it would stop the process.</p>

<p>Weekly Interest Rate of Six Percent, Priced at Ninety-Eight</p>
<p>Weekly Interest Rate of Six Percent, Priced at Ninety-Eight</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the regulations for the 20 million yuan Zhejiang local public bonds for the Republic of China Year 23, which were issued by the Zhejiang Provincial Government for disaster relief and other purposes, have been promulgated by the National Government. The interest rate is 6%. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has negotiated mortgages with banks in Shanghai. According to Xinsheng News Agency reporters, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Promulgation of Issuance: The regulations for the 20 million yuan public bonds issued by the Zhejiang Provincial Government for disaster relief etc. have been promulgated by the National Government. There are over fifteen articles. The weekly interest rate is 6%. According to the face value, it is issued at ninety-eight. The face value stipulates that it will be issued on October 1st. Interest will only be paid within two years from the date of issuance. Repayment of principal will begin in the third year, and principal and interest will be cleared by September 30th of the 38th year of the Republic of China. Principal will be repaid eight times a year in the 3rd and 9th months of each year through a lottery draw. Public bond denominations are divided into 10,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, and 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Negotiating Mortgages: Although these public bonds are stipulated to be issued on October 1st, according to the general practice of issuing public bonds, the official date of sale must wait until the public bonds are printed. Alternatively, public bond subscription certificates may be issued first, and then exchanged after printing. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has negotiated public bond mortgages with banks in Shanghai and has obtained the consent of each bank. The mortgage method still needs to be further negotiated. At the same time, a fund management committee will be organized to hand over the income from various guarantee taxes designated for the principal and interest repayment fund to the fund management committee for safekeeping.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this, Wang Xiaolai, Chu Huiseng, Yin Zhufu, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhang Weiru, Kui Yanfang, and other members of the Shanghai Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, took the 7:50 AM express train to Hangzhou yesterday morning to attend the Zhejiang Relief Affairs Conference and petition the provincial government to allocate 18 million yuan in work and emergency relief funds for relief. The opinions and methods obtained are as follows:</p>
<p>Opinions: The Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association's Proposal to the Provincial Government for the Distribution of Public Bonds</p>
<p>The original text states: "The 20 million yuan in disaster relief public bonds newly issued by Zhejiang Province were subject to winter telegrams from various Zhejiang fellow-provincial groups in Shanghai last month, requesting the undertaking of emergency relief and the repair of water conservancy throughout the province, and the use of work as relief, etc. Representatives were subsequently elected to petition the provincial government. This [association] has found that the drought disaster is severe, and after years of famine, and in the autumn of the collapse of rural villages, the livelihood of poor farmers has reached the end of the road and must be saved. The preparation of emergency relief is truly urgent. Work relief relates to water conservancy throughout the province, which is an essential plan for preventing future drought and flood, both fundamentally and symptomatically, and relies on large sums of money. The [association] has now drafted emergency and work relief standards for the distribution of public bonds, and humbly requests that they be examined and submitted to the Political Affairs Conference for discussion and implementation, so that millions of disaster victims may be able to survive. [We will be] endlessly grateful."</p>
<p>Emergency Relief: Investigate counties where there is no harvest and provide emergency relief first. According to the investigation report of the National Government's Relief Committee, the total area affected by the disaster in Zhejiang is 23,619,000 mu. Assuming that those with no harvest account for three-tenths of the total, there are 7,085,700 mu. Assuming that each disaster victim occupies 3 mu of land, the total number of disaster victims is approximately 2,361,900. Each person requires 2 dou of rice for relief, approximately 470,000 shi. Excluding the central government's exemption of taxes for purchasing foreign rice, each shi costs 7 yuan, for a total of 3,290,000 yuan. Please allocate 6 million yuan in public bonds, which, mortgaged at a 60% discount, would yield 3.6 million yuan, sufficient for purchasing rice.</p>
<p>Work Relief: Use local farmers to dredge the rivers, streams, ditches, and ponds in the disaster-stricken areas. This is the most essential and beneficial method of work relief in Zhejiang. The total area that should be dredged in the province has not been surveyed, so an accurate statistic cannot be obtained. However, it can be roughly estimated based on the area affected by the disaster. The total area affected by the disaster in the province is 23,619,000 mu. Assuming that the bank of each mu of land bordering water is 1 zhang wide, and the bottom of the river is 1 zhang 5 chi wide, the total area is 35,428,500 square zhang. Excluding mountainous fields that rely entirely on natural water sources and cannot be dredged, and lightly affected areas where dredging is unnecessary, estimated to be about 50% of the total, the area of waterways that should be dredged totals 17,714,250 square zhang. Assuming an average digging depth of 2 chi, totaling 35,428,500 cubic zhang, each cubic zhang is given 2 jiao for labor and meals (usually at least 4 jiao), for a total of 7,085,700 yuan. Please allocate 12 million yuan in public bonds, which, mortgaged at a 60% discount, would yield 7.2 million yuan, which would be more than enough for work relief.</p>

<p>Yesterday Held a Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees</p>
<p>The Xianju Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai held its first joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at 10:00 AM yesterday. Over 20 executive and supervisory committee members, including Wang Jingdong, attended. Representatives from the municipal party headquarters, including Zhou Lianhan, arrived to provide guidance.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The ceremony was performed, and Chairman Wang Jingdong led all executive and supervisory committee members in swearing an oath of office. Then, Wang Jingdong, Zhu Yao, and Wang Shujin were elected as standing committee members, Zhu Yao as secretary, Wang Jingdong as general affairs, Wang Shujin as finance, Wang Wuchen, Zhang Fulun, and Zhang Songtao as investigators, Wang Huanzhong as organization, Wang Bingkun as propaganda, Xu Yingshi, Wang Yuqiu, and Zhang Chulin as social affairs, and Shou Peng, Wang Yuchen, Wang Huanlang, and Wang Yiqiu as advisors. The chairman reported on relief efforts and documents. Then, Zhou Lianze, a representative from the municipal party headquarters, provided guidance. The following resolutions were then passed: (1) Regarding the disaster of the drought in our hometown, it was resolved to issue a circular telegram begging for relief and to hold a fundraising performance. (2) The method of collecting membership fees was resolved and handed over to the finance committee for deliberation. (3) It was resolved to continue recruiting members, and the entire committee would be responsible for carrying out this task. The relief telegram reads as follows: "To all newspapers in Shanghai and to various charitable organizations: We, Xianju, have unfortunately suffered since the beginning of summer from a relentless sun and lack of rain. Wells have dried up, rivers have run dry, the earth has cracked, and the crops have withered. The disaster is the most severe in decades. Now, most of the people in the county have no rice to cook. The old and the young are helping each other, but there is no one to borrow from. Tree leaves and grass roots are used as food. They are crying out for food and cannot survive the day. The young and weak cannot survive hunger and are abandoned in ditches. The strong are taking risks and banditry is a concern. Zheng Xia's [Tang Dynasty official who submitted a map illustrating the hardships of the people], map of the suffering of the people is echoed by moaning cries everywhere and the verses of Daya Yunhan [verses from the Book of Odes about longing for rain]. This association is looking forward to our hometown with extreme pain. Every movement is related to it and we have no other responsibility. In addition to days of discussing relief measures to assist, this disaster is particularly severe, the disaster area is wide, and the mind is long and the power is cotton. What can the cup of water in a cart of firewood do for this strange disaster? Moreover, at this time of commercial depression and economic collapse, we are struggling to make ends meet. We can't use anything to help. We are asking all charitable organizations to show benevolence and provide a source of aid to rescue the disaster victims. [The] merit is immeasurable. This is the most urgent request. The Xianju Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai bows. If you are willing to donate, please send it directly to the third floor of Zhenda Silk Fabric Bureau at the intersection of Fujian Road and Fuzhou Road in Shanghai."</p>
<h3 id="e96">Macheng Disaster Relief Committee Sends Telegrams Begging for Relief to the National Government and Various Places <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai received a letter from the Macheng Disaster Relief Committee:</p>
<p>To all: Macheng is unfortunate to have suffered a drought disaster after a bandit disaster. Since May, there have been over 70 days without rain. Rivers and ponds have dried up, and irrigation is exhausted. The crops in districts 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 have completely withered. In districts 2, 3, 8, and 9, one-third of the fields have not been planted, and those that have been planted have also withered. The county government has reported the disaster situation to higher levels. Now, the drought disaster is becoming more severe, rice and grain are lacking, and the people are panicking. Helpless disaster victims are applying to the county government for refugee passports. The more cunning ones are seizing large households and forcibly demanding resources. Although the county government has tried to stop this, the trend is difficult to completely eradicate. In addition, within the 9th district, dozens of people are starving to death every day. Residents by the river are mortgaging [assets] to draw water, but it is ultimately ineffective. As a result of worry and anger, there have been six suicides. The number of disaster victims inside and outside the city is increasing, with emaciated faces crying out for food. It is currently the wheat harvest, but in just two months, disaster victims will not be able to survive. The future is long, and the tragedy is unimaginable. The members of the association initially felt that the drought disaster was accidental and not an imminent crisis, but now they are so embarrassed and distressed. After silently observing the events of the past few years, they realized that the problem lies in more than one aspect. Accumulating gradually, not avoiding suspicion or resentment, they respectfully present their views with tears. Macheng has suffered a terrible bandit disaster. The 9th district and part of districts 1, 6, 7, and 8 have been bandit areas for seven years. The remaining districts have been repeatedly ravaged. Production has been reduced by more than half, and savings have been robbed completely. This is the main reason for the people's difficult lives. In addition, there are several other reasons that are sufficient to promote the collapse of the countryside. First [the looting of guest armies], since the 16th year of the Republic, guest armies, including Yuan Qian's troops, have occupied the county seat. Food and clothing are mostly provided by the local area. The losses, both public and private, are probably no less than millions of yuan. This is one reason. Second [the sharp reduction in production], the southwest countryside of our county produces cotton, and the northeast countryside produces yellow silk, wood oil, Poria cocos, and Tangfen. In recent years, the value has plummeted, less than two-thirds of the original market price. Merchants are unwilling to invest due to losses, and people are lazy to operate due to low prices. Although the autumn harvest last year was relatively ripe, farmers suffered from low grain prices and sluggish sales of local products. Financial resources were exhausted. This is two reasons. Third [the extremely heavy burden], in order to seek self-defense, the cost of the defense team was more than 200,000 yuan per year. Although the county magistrate followed the order to reduce it repeatedly, it still costs more than 11,000 yuan per month, and the temporary allocation of funds such as surtaxes, aircraft donations, and telegraph pole fees are not included in this amount. The people's strength is exhausted, and the burden is increasing day by day. This is three reasons. Fourth [the excessive number of military services], since the 2nd year of the Republic, three or four divisions of the National Army have been stationed in the county, averaging more than 3,000 long and short civilian laborers per day. For each long laborer, in addition to the price paid by the military, the people must allocate 6 to 8 yuan per month for family settlement. For each short laborer, a fee of 3 jiao must be allocated per day. Those who go have the suffering of eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, and those who live have the worry of being exploited day by day and month by month. The abandonment of agricultural affairs is only a minor matter. This is four reasons. Fifth [the loans were not repaid], when the bandit forces were rampant in the 21st year of the Republic, the garrison had difficulty providing food. They borrowed military rice and cash from the Songbu and county town chambers of commerce, totaling more than 500,000 yuan, which has never been repaid. Other scattered invitations and donations, combined over the years, should not be less than 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. This is five reasons. Sixth [the heavy workload], in recent years, more than 200 li of the roadbed in the three sections of the Zhong Zhong Ma Tuan area in the county has been built, and 700,000 civilian laborers have been requisitioned. Farmers work from afar and provide their own food, although they are given allowances, it is not enough to cover their daily food needs, and the occupation of good fields and the filling of ponds and embankments is enough to affect the livelihood of farmers. This is six reasons. With these six reasons, merchants and civilians are in distress. Fortunately, in recent years, the harvests have been relatively bountiful and can barely be supported. Now that we are suffering from a severe drought and the autumn harvest is completely hopeless, it is like a serious illness. The vitality of the county is in despair, and it is difficult to endure. According to statistics, the total number of people in the county is 550,000, combined with the number of displaced and newly recovered, no less than 600,000. And the total amount of harvest is calculated at 5 shi per mu, but only 1,280,000 shi, an average of just over 2 shi per person per year. Therefore, in a year of good harvest, it is necessary to rely on merchant sources such as Gu Xin and Huang Deng to provide assistance. Today, the neighboring counties are also suffering from drought, and the bandits in the northwest have not been cleared. There is no place to escape to, and no funds to report to. If we do not receive condescending compassion, these hundreds of thousands of disaster victims will surely become starved corpses. Speaking of this, tears cannot be avoided. The association is complying with the request of the disaster victims to submit to the county government, and also implementing disaster relief matters in order. In terms of relief, we are investigating the actual number of remaining yi mai [types of grain], banning unscrupulous merchants from raising prices and hoarding, collecting arrears, preparing to use it to stabilize grain prices, and purchasing seeds to facilitate farmers replanting. In terms of regulation, we are requesting the resident military commander not to procure military rice locally, ordering merchants in various cities not to consume rice for profit, ordering various clan ancestral temples to move income to relieve their clansmen, persuading gentry and wealthy people to donate grain in order to stabilize market prices, and all that we can do has been actively implemented. However, the disaster area is too wide and there are too many disaster victims. It is difficult to provide relief with the strength of one county. Taking the 9th district of the county as an example, Feng and other funds have been provided to them, amounting to no less than 20,000 yuan, and more than 7,000 yuan has been allocated from the immigration funds for rations. More than 4,000 yuan was spent on buying firewood cut by refugees. The deaths are still reported monthly. Moreover, the disaster has spread throughout the county, and the number of disaster victims has increased tenfold. This is the fundamental cause of the county's vitality.</p>
<p>After suffering from the disasters, it is difficult to survive. I am extremely concerned about the suffering people. I respectfully request that the officials consider the suffering of the people and spread benevolent winds. The county's situation is special. I hope that they will understand and provide relief. I hope that you will not ask for thousands, leading to disaster. However, considering the current situation of the county, it is impossible to save the dying disaster victims without a major emergency relief effort. It is impossible to maintain good governance without a large number of agricultural and industrial plants. According to recent news, the provincial government has issued 5,000 yuan for agricultural relief and has handed it over to the county magistrate to purchase autumn seeds. It has also issued 17,000 yuan for work relief and has sent dozens of people from the disaster relief and preparedness association's engineering team to the county to handle it. The provincial government has spared no effort to provide relief to the county. The disaster victims in the county would not dare to ask for more than what is necessary. Only because the county is a border area, the stake is extremely high. On the one hand, it is the gateway to eastern Hubei. On the other hand, it is the screen for counties such as Gangpo. In recent years, the National Army has sacrificed countless troops and countless money to achieve considerable results. Unfortunately, they suffered from a severe drought. The bandits will surely use this opportunity to incite the disaster victims. Saving the disaster victims is a matter of life and death. It is guaranteed that they will not take risks. If food cannot be provided and order cannot be maintained, the remnant civilians will belong to both sides, and the collapse of the fence will increase the government's worries. Saving the county is to protect eastern Hubei, and protecting eastern Hubei is to protect the overall border area of the three provinces. The people of the county have survived nine deaths and one life, and have now encountered a drought disaster that has intensified. Disaster relief is difficult. The situation is urgent, so I can only tell you with tears. I earnestly request [leaders] to provide exceptional relief, allocate millions of dollars in relief funds, and save hundreds of thousands of disaster victims. This is the most urgent request. Macheng County Disaster Relief Committee, Yu Jinfang, Zheng Kangshi, Liu Rulie, and others bow.</p>

<p>Scheduled for the 13th at the Asia Cultural Association</p>
<p>In recent years, the trend of national films featuring singing, the widespread sales of radio receivers, and the abnormal development of dance halls have all contributed to society's interest and need for music and songs. Although lewd lyrics and songs catering to low-level tastes have also taken advantage of this trend, it has become a present reality that the general public has gradually developed a fondness for music through these objective influences. Currently, in China's literary, artistic, film, and music circles, there is no lack of people with aspirations to reverse the decline of popular songs in the times. In records and films, several meaningful songs are gradually being produced. After a song in the Lianhua film [Song of the Fishermen] became popular this summer, the domestic film industry has also competed to excel in this area. According to interviews conducted by reporters, the following is a compilation of songs in various new films currently being produced or about to be released by film companies: The Mingxing film [Daughter's Classic] has two songs, one is [Xiang Lei], originally written by Guo Moruo, and the other is [Afraid of Spring Returning], written by Li Pingqian. Another new film [Nostalgia] has a song [Orphanage Song], written by Ren Guang An . It is also said that there will be a song in the film [Rebirth Flower], but the title is yet to be determined. The Lianhua film [ The Road] has four songs: 1. The theme song for the road construction, named [Pioneers of the Road], written by Shi Yi; 2. A song about the theme of the road, written by Sun Yu; both of the above songs were composed by Nie Er; 3. [Swallow Song]; 4. [Fengyang Song], both are collaborative works by Ren Guang An and . Another Lianhua film, [New Woman], is said to involve mass music education and the social impact of music in its theme. Naturally, there will be new song creations in it. However, because the company strictly guards the secrets of this script, the song titles are not yet known in detail. It is said that the author is the playwright Sun Shiyi. The Tianyi Company films [Dream of the Red Chamber] and [Spring Night Song] have [Lotus Picking Song] and [Spring Night Song] written by Ren Guang An and . The Diantong Company film [Peach Tribulation] has [Graduation Song] written by Nie Er. The Yihua Company film [Immortal Fairy] has [Immortal Fairy] and [Silvery Sadness] written by Li Jinhui. Among the above songs, those that have been entrusted to Baidai Company to record include [Xiang ] sung by Hu Die, [Afraid of Spring Returning] sung by Xuan Jinglin, [Pioneers of the Road] and [The Road] sung by various stars of Jin Lianhua , [Swallow ] sung by Chen Yanyan, [Fengyang Song] sung by Li Lili, [Tea Picking Song] sung by Chen Yumei, [Graduation Song] sung by Yuan Muzhi and Chen Boer, and [Immortal Fairy] and [Silvery Sadness] sung by Bai Hong. It is said that Baidai Company will hold a preview of fifty or sixty new songs at the Asia Cultural Association on Bowuyuan Road on the 13th of this month, inviting celebrities from the local news, film, literary, artistic, drama, music, and dance circles. In addition to film songs, there will be many songs that are not easily heard elsewhere. At that time, in the sound and shadow of song, a showcase-style appreciation of new songs in our country will be a grand event in the local cultural circles.</p>

<p>In recent years, China's construction industry has flourished, coupled with the eastward spread of European trends and the pursuit of modernity, the demand for paint is increasing day by day. Its use can not only increase the appearance of objects, but also has the function of preventing decay. However, although our country has established factories engaged in manufacturing, imported goods are still pouring in, making it increasingly difficult. Mr. Lu Lianfang is a person with vision. Young and handsome, he has always held the ambition of saving the country through industry. After the January 28th Incident, he founded Wanli Paint Factory and served as its general manager. For two years, he worked diligently and achieved considerable success. Business grew rapidly, but due to disagreements among shareholders, he felt it difficult to handle affairs, so he resigned from the board of directors. He gathered like-minded people to organize a new factory, named Guanglu Paint Company, found several acres of vacant land on Nan Road, designed and built the factory, and set up a preparatory office at No. 174 Huanlong Road. Soon, the latest national oil products will be sold on the market. With Mr. Lu's experience, excellent products, and business prospects, success can be predicted. The above is a recent photo of Mr. Lu.</p>

<p>Effective December 1st</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that the names of many cities and provinces where telegraph bureaus and radio stations are located have been changed, and that the names of the bureaus and stations still largely use the old names, which are inconsistent with the local names and easily lead to misunderstandings, should be corrected separately to ensure uniformity. It is understood that the ministry yesterday ordered the renamed bureaus and stations to implement the changes from December 1st of this year. Within the first three months, when receiving telegrams sent by the bureaus and stations, in addition to translating and noting the name of the sending bureau and station, the receiving bureau and station should also add the old name to benefit the public.</p>

<p>Two Freight Cars Derailed</p>
<p>Pilgrimage Train Continues as Usual</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway had a special train due to the pilgrimage to the Chang'an Catholic Church. Over three hundred Chinese and foreign ladies and gentlemen of faith attended to participate in the Mass, so the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway specially opened the No. 901 train, equipped with four third-class passenger cars, one second/third-class passenger car, and one official car. It departed from the South Station yesterday morning at 6:05 AM. Unexpectedly, when the train reached Laolonghua Station (at 6:18 AM), the Hangzhou-bound No. 804 night freight train also arrived at that time, so it stopped to wait for the interchange. The freight train had to give way to the main line, but before it had completely entered the siding, the special train started to depart, colliding with the No. 5619 and No. 10143 freight cars at the rear of the freight train, damaging four sections of the siding track. The two freight cars also derailed, but fortunately the impact was light and they did not overturn. The main line track from Shanghai to Hangzhou was not damaged, so the special train stopped for about ten minutes and then proceeded to Chang'an Station. The Laolonghua Station Master immediately telegraphed the South Station to report the accident. Zhong Wenjiang, the head of the train operations section stationed at the South Station, immediately notified the engineering department and dispatched over a hundred craftsmen from the locomotive department's Longtou depot on a salvage vehicle, supervised by Director Zhong. At 7:00 AM, they rode to Laolonghua, first repairing the four damaged sections of track and then using a crane to lift the two derailed freight cars back onto the track. The traffic was restored to normal after about 2:00 PM.</p>

<p>Chen's Couple Leaves Behind a Daughter</p>
<p>Taken in and Raised by Philanthropists</p>
<p>Chen Fangruo, a native of Hubei, about 37 or 38 years old, lived in Shanghai as a writer. He and his wife, Liu Jie, 32 years old, rented a pavilion room at No. 64 Shanfuli, Lane 148, Shanzhong Road, French Concession. On the morning of June 8th of this year, at around 8:00 AM, the couple had just gotten up when two thugs suddenly came upstairs, claiming to be delivering loquats, and opened fire, killing Chen and his wife. The police sent the bodies to the coroner's office and reported to the Second Special Court for confirmation. As there were no relatives, the bodies were buried by a charity. They left behind a daughter, about five or six years old, who was all alone. She was taken in and raised by philanthropists out of pity. This was reported in previous newspapers. It is now reported that the assassins in this case have been apprehended by the police. Due to some connection to another case, they have been taken by a certain agency for interrogation.</p>

<p>Witness Sees Three Punches</p>
<p>Both Suspects Deny Accusations</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoerzi, a 14-year-old from Siyang, was a coal-adding apprentice at the Xiejizhi Glass Factory in Binlangqiao, West Shanghai. Gao Huailin, a native of Yangzhou, was also an apprentice at the same factory. On August 31st of this year, while working at the factory, Gao asked Jiang to add coal, but Jiang refused, leading to an argument and a physical altercation. Another apprentice, Zhou Dayun, saw this and stepped forward to mediate. However, Jiang Xiaoerzi not only refused to listen but also used foul language. Zhou, enraged, rushed forward and punched Jiang violently. Jiang Xiaoerzi collapsed to the ground, barely breathing. The factory manager heard about this and ordered a car to take him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. He died in the hospital on September 3rd. The police arrested Zhou Dayun and Gao Huailin and sent them to the former Sixth District Police Station and then to the local court. Prosecutor Wu Deying conducted a preliminary hearing and brought charges against them in the criminal court. The trial was held yesterday morning by Judge Zhang Shao in the Fifth Court. The factory manager testified that according to another worker, Gao Huailin asked Jiang Xiaoerzi to add coal, but Jiang refused, leading to an argument and a physical altercation. Zhou Dayun stepped forward to mediate, but he did not witness the fight. The witness Jiang Afu, 22 years old, a native of Siyang and an apprentice at the factory, testified: (Question) What did you see? (Answer)</p>
<h3 id="e117">Jiao Yitang's Opinion on the Aconite Tide <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>National Medicine and National Drugs Should Unite to Resist Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>Since the Ningbo County Aconite Shell Cooperative raised the price of high-quality aconite shells, triggering a trend in the Shanghai national medical community to not use aconite shells, and with the cooperative and Shanghai medical and pharmaceutical organizations holding conflicting views that are difficult to reconcile, the New Voice News reporter, in order to clarify the truth, made a special trip to Beijing to visit Jiao Yitang, a Central Committee member and director of the Central National Medical Hall, to inquire about his opinion. Jiao expressed deep emotion. Furthermore, Wu Qianqian, a local national doctor, also expressed fair opinions on the aconite shell trend. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Jiao Yitang's Speech: Jiao first stated that he has never had prejudice against the national medicine and pharmaceutical community. However, national medicine and national drugs are currently in a turbulent situation, and they are too busy uniting to resist foreign aggression to have any intention of capitalizing on scarcity and inciting internal strife, which would be a misguided strategy. From the cooperative's perspective, raising prices would only help foreign goods to be sold at dumping prices and exploit the hard work of farmers and workers, effectively shortening the lifespan of our national medicine and drugs. He only hopes that they will consider the welfare of patients and repent. Just like the [Minsheng] and [Foci] pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai, which use Chinese raw materials, extract and test ingredients, improve processing methods, and resist foreign goods, saving considerable losses to the country, which is beneficial to both national economy and the people's livelihood, why must they profit by sucking the fat of their own country's sick and laugh at foreign countries? He believes that the Shanghai medical and pharmaceutical organizations and the cooperative have many enlightened people, and that with the public opinion community upholding justice, both parties will be able to consider the overall situation. The cooperative should still sincerely and strictly implement the contract signed with the National Pharmaceutical Association to be effective, so that drug prices will fall, the aconite tide can be avoided from expanding, and the well-being of patients will be taken as the premise. In the twelfth issue of the Guanghua Medical and Pharmaceutical Magazine, Jiao's detailed opinions on the aconite shell trend are published.</p>
<p>Wu Qianqian's Opinion: Furthermore, Wu Qianqian, a local national doctor, expressed his opinions on the aconite shell trend from three perspectives related to the Department of Agriculture and Politics as follows: (1) The issue of rural areas: Patients use medicine at a certain time, while the livelihood of farmers is related to the countryside. Some argue that the rural economy is currently bankrupt, and it is not possible to destroy the rural economy by boycotting aconite shells. They are unaware that the medical community's refusal to use aconite shells is to resist the cooperative's existing goods and to hope that farmers will sell as much aconite shell as possible. If the supply of aconite shell already exceeds demand, then there is no reason for this. Selling aconite shell is prevalent throughout China, but its production is only limited to a part of Zhejiang Province. If the price is low, it will harm the farmers of Zhejiang, which is not a fact. (2) The issue of provincial administration: Zhejiang Province approved the cooperative's exclusive operating rights. Its initial intention was nothing more than to benefit Zhejiang in Zhejiang, but it did not consider that the price would rise to such an extent. The benefit to the people of Zhejiang has not been seen, but the impact on the patients and medical and pharmaceutical communities nationwide is enormous. If its malpractices take effect, then Rehmannia glutinosa will be hoarded in Henan, Coptis chinensis will be hoarded in Sichuan, Aucklandia lappa will be hoarded in Guangdong, and Codonopsis pilosula will be hoarded in Shanxi. All medicines will skyrocket, and in severe cases, they will disappear from the market. The future of national medicine is unimaginable. This humble person from Zhejiang also does not want to hear about the selfishness and self-interest of the people of Zhejiang. Therefore, not promoting local methods must be included in the ban, and promoting local methods as much as possible will make the price fair and the trend will cease. (3) The issue of substitutes: Peucedanum praeruptorum and aconite shell have similar properties and effects. Using them as substitutes does not affect the overall situation. However, a few Chinese medicine practitioners believe that they cannot be substituted, and some patients even point out their disadvantages. Some Western doctors even consider Peucedanum praeruptorum to be a digestive medicine and aconite shell to be a respiratory medicine. This is due to stubborn prejudice on the one hand, ignorance on the other, and Western doctors' lack of knowledge of Chinese medicine, none of which are accurate arguments. Peucedanum praeruptorum and aconite shell are not comparable to life-saving drugs. If their effects are similar, how can substitution cause illness? In the past, when there was no aconite shell, only Fritillaria cirrhosa, it was never heard that coughs and phlegm were difficult to treat without aconite shell. Furthermore, Zhu Huilao said that he once coughed up blood due to substituting Peucedanum praeruptorum for aconite shell, which is absolutely not the case in pharmacology or medicine. If substituting Pinellia ternata for aconite shell could cause coughing up blood, it is possible. Peucedanum praeruptorum eliminates phlegm and lowers qi, and is even used in prescriptions for coughing up blood. How can it cause hemoptysis? Even if it does, it is likely a coincidence. Furthermore, both Peucedanum praeruptorum and aconite shell are respiratory medicines. Considering them to be digestive medicines is a mistake. However, this humble person hopes that temporary substitution is acceptable, but long-term substitution will ultimately be inconvenient. It is only hoped that the cooperative will broaden its horizons and sincerely cooperate with the medical and pharmaceutical community, so that drug prices will be slightly lower, and patients will benefit more. Because I heard the sound of arguing, I rushed forward and saw Zhou Dayun punching Jiang Xiao Erzi in the back three times. The interrogating official ordered the detention of Zhou Dayun and Gao Huailin to be brought to the case. Zhou Dayun confessed that he was seventeen years old, from Suqian, and lived in Minghua Lane, Robert Road. (Question) Jiang Afu said that you punched Jiang Xiao Erzi three times, is that true? (Answer) I went forward to pull him away and did not hit him. I was really wronged. Gao Huailin confessed that he was eleven years old and lived in Yufu Lane, Meiyuan Intersection, Gonghe Road. (Question) Why did you argue with Jiang Xiao Erzi? (Answer) The stove fire was about to go out, so I called Jiang Xiao Erzi to add coal. Jiang refused and scolded me instead. (Question) Did you hit him? (Answer) I did not hit him, but I grabbed and twisted him. Zhou Dayun came to pull him away. According to the statement of the deceased's brother, Jiang Ade, my brother was brutally beaten to death by Zhou Dayun's punches. I request that justice be served. At this point in the interrogation, the interrogating official invited prosecutor Wu Deying to the court. After the arguments were presented, the debate began. The lawyer Liu Xiang, hired by the two defendants, rose to defend them for a long time, requesting a verdict of innocence.

<p>| Jiang Jingwan's Lawsuit Dismissed |</p>
<p>Jiang Jingwan, a Nanjing woman residing at No. 47, South Gaoshou Lane, Haining Road, is 38 years old. She recently hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-prosecution with the First Special Court against her younger brother, Jiang Guoying (37 years old, residing at No. 58, Lane 41, Carter Road), for violating Articles 356 of the Criminal Law by encroaching on their deceased father's estate. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the interrogation in the Fifth Criminal Court. The defendant also appeared with a lawyer. The plaintiff, Jiang Jingwan, stated that her biological father was Jiang Xingqi, and her adoptive father was Jiang Shengshu. Her adoptive father passed away when she was sixteen years old. Because she was away in another city, she did not know how the property rights were handled. It was not until October of the year before last that she learned that the estate had been divided. In April of last year, she entrusted her aunt to consult with the defendant, but the defendant refused to hand over her share of the property and thực hiện encroachment, hence the lawsuit. After Judge Huang briefly questioned the defendant, he ruled that since the plaintiff and defendant were siblings, self-prosecution was not allowed under the law, and the statute of limitations had also expired. Therefore, the self-prosecution was dismissed, and she was advised to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court.</p>

<p>All Victims Were Summoned for Identification</p>
<p>Due to a Large Number of Witnesses, the Hearing Was Postponed</p>
<p>Chinese and Western detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station successively arrested fourteen men and women, including thieves Xu Genyou (aka Xu Jiahe), Liu Jixiu, Chen Si, Cui Anqing, Gao Asan, Xu Rongcheng, Wang Shanlin, Xu Zhimei, Wang Chenshi, Yao Jinchu, Cao Guansheng, Zhang Fengming, Zhang Zilin, and Lu Yuanbing (aka Da Qinzi), in various locations such as Xiaoshadu Road on Hart Road last month. Five pistols and two hundred and nineteen bullets were confiscated and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention pending further investigation of their crimes. Details of the situation have been recorded in this newspaper. It has now been learned from the Chinese and Western detectives handling this case that the defendants robbed Yao Zhushi, a resident of No. 35, Jiangjia Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, of 170 silver dollars on August 24th of this year. They also robbed Xi Shunchang Shoe Store at No. 788, Xiaoshadu Road, of fourteen pairs of shoes worth 56 silver dollars on the 6th of last month. Furthermore, at 2:40 p.m. on January 31st, they used weapons to stop the No. 688 car driven by the Westerner Luo Bosheng on Jiaozhou Road, boarded the car and robbed Luo of 470 silver dollars, and opened fire in an attempt to kill Luo Bosheng, which failed.

At the same time, they resisted arrest and opened fire in an attempt to kill Chinese policemen Zhang Dengshan (No. 356) and Ma Yi and Fang Wei (No. 991), among other important cases. Therefore, the detectives summoned all the victims to the police station for identification. Yesterday morning, the detectives escorted the thieves to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. In addition to presenting the case, the police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that there were a large number of witnesses in this case, and he was concerned that there would not be enough time to conduct the hearing today.

<h3 id="e120">Citizens of Pudong Request the Construction of a Pudong Water Plant <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>High Population Density Makes Water Collection Difficult</p>
<p>Hygiene and Fire Prevention Are Even More Important</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News, the Municipal Government once planned to build a water plant in Pudong, but it was shelved due to lack of funds. The citizens of Pudong feel quite inconvenienced. In recent years, the population density in Pudong has increased, and the drinking water for citizens is dirty, and water collection is difficult. In the event of a fire, it is often difficult to contain the spread due to the distance of the water source. Both hygiene and fire prevention are even more important. The local citizens believe that the establishment of a water plant in Pudong only requires 230,000 yuan, but the Municipal Government shelved it on the grounds of lack of funds, while a construction project that is not urgently needed in Puxi, costing hundreds of thousands of yuan, is immediately started. Furthermore, the tax burden of the citizens of Pudong is no different from that of the citizens of Puxi. Why is the enjoyment of material things so unfair? It is now heard that 61 businesses, including Chen Tai, Dongsheng, Xiangtai, Zhang Tianyi, Lao Songsheng, Shunxing, Rentai, Xintai, Qiandefeng, Xinxingchang, Yongyuantai, Dingshengtai, Gongtai, Yichun, Bin Da, Datonghe, and Wanyuan, have jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be forwarded to the Municipal Government for review and approval, and that the two bureaus of finance and public works be instructed to complete the Pudong water plant as soon as possible to benefit the people's livelihood.</p>

<p>Tongrenhe Paint Shop, located at No. 80, Minguo Road, French Concession, is owned by Xu Chengdong (35 years old this year) from Shaoxing Yuyao. It has been in business for many years. It is now being sued by Li Anha (transliteration), the English manager of the German Defu Foreign Firm at No. 261 Sichuan Road, who has found that the shop is counterfeiting the Candle Trademark paint sold by the firm, which has affected the firm's business. According to intelligence reports, the French police were asked to investigate. The head of the police approved the request and ordered Chinese and Western detectives to search the premises. 3,500 sheets of Candle Trademark paper were seized, along with the shop owner Xu Chengdong, and taken to the police station. Xu confessed that in 1929, he ordered five large barrels of Candle paint from Defu Foreign Firm for the purpose of making candles. Later, with the consent of the firm, he repackaged the barreled paint into small tin cans for sale and commissioned the Xinmin Printing House in Xinxin Lane in the Chinese area to print 5,000 sheets of Candle Trademark paper for distribution and sale. 1,400 cans have been sold, but due to the inferior quality of the goods, customers often returned them. The seized Trademark paper is what was left over from before. According to the confession, the head of the police ordered Xu to leave and await further investigation. The police station transferred the case to the Second Special Court a few days ago. The police station lawyer filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 269 of the Criminal Law for obstructing agricultural, industrial, and commercial crime. Judge Wu Fanglian heard the case in the Eighth Criminal Court. Since the defendant Xu Chengdong was not present, the police station lawyer and the plaintiff stated the case.

<p>"Paris Will Show Erotic Sound Film"　The Paris Theater on Avenue Joffre has been particularly strict in selecting sound films since autumn. The current showing is "Gahant Lody," a latest blockbuster from United Artists, which tells a moving story of ethics and love. Starting on National Day, the Universal sound film "The Girl in the Cab" will be shown, which has not yet been screened in Shanghai. It stars Gemi Hua, who is good at playing humorous characters. The film is full of poetry and tells a very tortuous story of a musician's romantic encounter. It includes scenes of a beautiful woman bathing and losing her clothes, feeling embarrassed and wanting to cry, as well as a scene where the musician hides in a cello, which is both erotic and funny, making people unable to stop laughing. The remaining poetic and erotic scenes are too numerous to mention.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>I am writing in response to the news item in your newspaper on the 7th of this month regarding the collapse of our factory's drying platform, which injured people. The information in your report is not consistent with the facts. Our factory's drying platform is made of wood. At the time of the incident yesterday, work had already stopped, and the workers were resting on the platform. Unfortunately, it suddenly collapsed, causing minor injuries. They have been treated at the hospital and have recovered. The report in your newspaper that the incident occurred while they were tanning leather and that they were seriously injured by being crushed under a pile of tiles, with some suffering life-threatening injuries to the abdomen, is based on hearsay. We are concerned that the public may not understand the truth, so we are writing to request that your newspaper make a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jin Xie Ji Leather Factory</p>
<p>7th</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>I have read the news item in your "Local News" column on September 28th, titled "Zhou Guansan Sued by His Wife." It states that Zhou Guansan's younger brother, Zhou Lansheng, sent a letter to his brother containing various slanderous remarks. I was shocked and dismayed upon reading this. Zhou Guansan's family has lived in Hushen, Hangzhou for generations and is known for their virtuous and upright character. They have always valued propriety and righteousness. His ancestors and father were respected members of the community. Zhou Guansan has followed in their footsteps, carefully maintaining his self-respect in all his actions. He is a handsome and promising young man, highly regarded in his hometown. We suspect that malicious individuals are attempting to damage his reputation by fabricating facts and spreading rumors to confuse the public. We, as long-time residents of Hushen, have a better understanding of the situation. We know Zhou Guansan's behavior from childhood to adulthood and are fully aware of the truth. How can the unsubstantiated claims of his younger brother Lansheng, based solely on hearsay, be used as the sole tool to damage Zhou Guansan's reputation? Although this matter is not our concern, we feel compelled to speak out because the facts are clear, and truth must be distinguished from falsehood. We have long admired your newspaper for upholding justice, so we are writing to request a correction to prevent confusion and ensure accuracy. We would be grateful if you would grant our request.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zhao Shunnian, Wang Huting, Fang Zirong, Shen Shuyi, Wu Dasheng, Jin Jiayun, Ma Yumen, Xie Songsheng, residents of Hushen, Hangzhou</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Hong Rummei of Wah Sin Hong Kee Company, who informed me that on the afternoon of the 5th of this month, I went to the Xin Sheng Hospital to pay a fee, but the hospital was suddenly raided by the police, which implicated me as well. After being taken to the police station, I explained the situation and provided proof, and I was immediately released. However, the news item in your newspaper on the 6th, regarding the morphine seized at Xin Sheng Hospital, mistakenly identified me as a mixing engineer and failed to mention that I was released on the spot and not sent to court. I believe this is a misrepresentation of the facts and is based on hearsay. I am writing to request a correction to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Yan Zhi</p>
<p>Received October 7th</p>
<p>Regarding the "Wang Guoliang, Young Man, Affair with Old Woman" news item:</p>
<p>We are writing in response to a report in your newspaper (dated the 4th) that Mr. Yu's husband, Wang Guoliang, the owner of Shun Chang Xiang Foreign Goods Store at No. 990, Betang Road, Xujiahui, had an affair with an old woman and that Mr. Yu caught them in the act. This is inconsistent with the facts. We would like to present the following key points for correction:</p>
<p>(1) Yu, Guoliang's wife, is surnamed Tong, not Xu as reported in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(2) The old woman, Zhu Liu, is a relative of Yu's family, and the two families had a close relationship. Later, due to a dispute over money, they became resentful of Yu. This spring, they even had a verbal altercation. Unexpectedly, after the altercation, she directly told Yu's husband, which caused discord in the family because Yu's husband only heard one side of the story. This escalated into physical and verbal abuse from all three sides. Due to the unresolved dispute, they went to the French Concession police station to request mediation and sign a settlement agreement. The old woman voluntarily agreed to stay away from Xujiahui. Therefore, the report that Yu gathered a group of women and caught the old woman and the young man in the act and took them to the Second Special Court is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>(3) After the settlement at the police station, Yu's husband continued to work at the store every day, as witnessed by relatives and customers. The statement that he moved to West Xinqiao to live secretly with the old woman is also absurd.</p>
<p>(4) Yu's husband has not been ill recently, let alone bedridden, which has been witnessed by many people. Therefore, the report of his being bedridden is absolutely incorrect.</p>
<p>(5) On the 3rd of this month, the old woman Zhu Liu, her anger reignited, violated her previous agreement, and returned to Xujiahui. She stood at the tram stop in front of Yu's store, staring into the store. Suddenly, she got off the tram and attempted to cause trouble. Yu was forced to take her to the Catholic Church for judgment. The matter was resolved after mediation.</p>
<p>The key points of the actual events, which differ significantly from your newspaper's report, are as stated above. We respectfully request that you make a prompt correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Wang Tong (personally signed)</p>

<p>Announcement of the Suspension of "Reading Q&amp;A"</p>
<p>Time flies so quickly. "Reading Q&amp;A" has met with you for a full nine months. Apart from the Lunar New Year holidays and occasional suspensions due to insufficient space in the newspaper, which occurred no more than ten times, tens of thousands of readers have been reading it every day. We are very honored to have gained so many supporters in spirit, but on the other hand, we cannot help but feel ashamed.</p>
<p>What have we actually given to the readers? On the eve of this suspension, we did some serious reflection. Before we part ways, we must make a confession: we cannot deny that what we have given to others, if not zero, is too limited.</p>
<p>This is by no means a humble statement. First, because "Reading Q&amp;A" is only part of the work of this department, and this department itself is only a department of the library, we do not have enough time to make "Reading Q&amp;A" more vibrant and practical. Second, because of the space constraints of the newspaper, news articles are often squeezed together, and the "Reading Q&amp;A" often has to be cut into sections, making it difficult for readers to connect the beginning and the end, making reading it equivalent to not reading it. Third, because the people who write the reading Q&amp;As are mostly bookworms, who are too far removed from the actual lives of shop assistants and apprentices, the things they write inevitably carry a scholarly atmosphere and cannot be approached by people who truly lack education. Fourth, we have also received many well-intentioned criticisms and rigorous corrections from various quarters. We have tried hard to be impartial, but our efforts have been in vain, and we cannot live up to everyone's expectations. In short, after reflecting on ourselves, we only feel ashamed and blame ourselves. Now we do not want to continue doing this work that we cannot do well. We would like to thank and apologize to all those who care about us.</p>
<p>What about the future? We are library workers, and our work in reading guidance in the library will not end because of this. On the contrary, we can concentrate our efforts on other aspects. At the same time, we can add a note to console readers: Reading Life will soon publish a reading magazine called Reading Life Biweekly. In the future, any questions about reading may be discussed in that publication. Now that we are temporarily suspending this corner of the newspaper, you will probably not feel too lonely!</p>
<p>Before and after this, we sincerely hope that readers will continue to acquire new knowledge in their daily lives. Today's China is in a very rich era. As long as you are true to your life and diligent in acquiring knowledge, you can gain knowledge everywhere. We encourage you to read, but at the same time, do not trust books too much. We encourage you to spend a minute on the street or in the market, rather than returning to a clean and bright study. We wish you all the best.</p>

<p>I. News from "Reading Life"</p>
<p>I. Reading Life will be edited by the Reading Life Society and published by the Shanghai Magazine Company.</p>
<p>Reading Life was originally planned to be edited by the Reading Guidance Department of the Shen Bao Circulation Library. However, due to insufficient manpower in that department, it will now be edited by the Reading Life Society. The president of the society is still Mr. Li Gongpu. People from Shanghai's cultural circles with experience in teaching have been invited to form the Reading Life Society. Reading Life will be published biweekly, with approximately 50,000 words per issue, and will be published by the Shanghai Magazine Company. The first issue will be published next month.</p>
<p>II. Solicitation of Contributions for "Reading Life"</p>
<p>The content of "Reading Life" has been announced in Issue 27 of this publication and will remain largely unchanged. The publication pays special attention to the investigation of readers' lives in various social classes, so it particularly requests contributions of "Life Records" from shop assistants, apprentices, workers, soldiers, farmers, and all other professionals, even those who do not usually write articles. All readers who can write, regardless of whether their writing is good or not, are welcome to submit their unique life experiences to the publication. Those who cannot write but would like to share their lives can write to the publication, and reporters will be sent to record their stories. However, these life records should not contain any idle talk, and each article should not exceed 3,000 words. At the same time, we also welcome "Self-Study Experience Talks" and "Reading Notes" from people with busy lives, but each article should be limited to 1,500 words. Please send your contributions to Reading Life Society, Shanghai Magazine Company, No. 30, Sima Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>II. News of the YMCA Reading Club</p>
<p>The YMCA Reading Club held its second inaugural meeting at the Eight Immortals Bridge on the 7th of this month. More than 150 members attended, and Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, personally attended to provide guidance. The meeting began at 9:00 AM as scheduled, with Mr. Li Gongpu presiding. Director Pan gave a speech, which mainly covered the purpose of reading, the purpose of the YMCA in running the reading club, the attitude towards reading, and the outlook on life, among other things. His arguments were brilliant. The full text of his speech will be published in the YMCA publication. Representatives from the advanced class, Yang Lijun, and the elementary class, Wang Wenqing, also gave speeches. After the speeches, the classes were divided. There are two classes: advanced and elementary. The meeting time is still set for Thursdays from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM and Sundays from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM at the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge. It is reported that there are still many vacancies for members in the club. People who are interested in reading are welcome to join. For application procedures, please write to the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Jewish Team Crumbles; Yu You Achieves a Resounding 7-2 Victory <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The disparity in strength allowed Yu You to consistently dominate.</p>
<p>In the final moments, the Jewish team conceded five consecutive goals.</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the first encounter between Central and Western teams in the Western Union First Division Football League. Yu You faced the Jewish team at Shen Garden. Having revamped their lineup, Yu You's strength was significantly enhanced, resulting in a crushing 7-2 victory over the newly promoted Jewish team. In the first half, the Jewish team, relying on their initial momentum, stubbornly resisted, resulting in a 1-1 tie. However, Yu You eventually took a 2-1 lead. In the second half, after going up 3-2, Yu You scored five consecutive goals, causing the Jewish team to crumble and suffer a crushing 7-2 defeat. Five to six thousand spectators watched and cheered, departing joyfully.</p>
<p>Jewish Technique Remains Immature</p>
<p>Yu You's handling of the</p>
<p>Jewish team yesterday can</p>
<p>be described as effortless,</p>
<p>consistently holding the</p>
<p>upper hand. Opportunities to score were numerous, but due to poor teamwork and unfamiliarity, the inability to coordinate led to countless missed chances, which is regrettable. Only Sun Jinshun and Luo Haiguang were able to score, while Zhong Yuxiang was completely unable to do so. The left wing was practically non-existent. Yu You's defense was decent, with Li Huiming being reliable and Yun Feng and Lie Mai putting in effort. Although Zhong Yongsen ran all over the field, the forward line felt uneven. As for the Jewish team, they possessed only courage, while their technique remained immature. The left wing of the forward line posed some danger.</p>
<p>Iron Leg Unleashes Power, Opening the Scoring</p>
<p>As the battle commenced, Yu</p>
<p>You kicked off. The Jewish</p>
<p>team fought desperately,</p>
<p>gritting their teeth and</p>
<p>repeatedly charging Yu You's defense. Li Huiguan commanded calmly, while Zuo Yun and Liang, the two generals, stubbornly guarded the gate, preventing any mishaps. Soon, Xiao Yun obtained a free-kick opportunity and passed it to South Seas star Zhong Yuxiang. Gao Erfei turned to intercept, but Zhong reacted swiftly, quickly lobbing it towards the center. Sun Jinshun, with lightning speed, shot the ball before it hit the ground, catching Dicklerek off guard and scoring a goal.</p>
<p>Mutual Exchange Concludes the First Half</p>
<p>The Jewish team, having suffered</p>
<p>this heavy blow, could not</p>
<p>endure it and sought</p>
<p>revenge. Pi Lingji took the</p>
<p>lead, leading his troops westward, but Li Huiguan ambushed him halfway, rendering his efforts futile. Pang Que sneaked into Yu You's penalty area, inviting Liang to charge. Pang passed the ball to L. Greenberg, who advanced like lightning and created a tie with a resounding shot. Seeing the danger, Luo Haiguang led his troops east, launching a solo attack, forcing a corner kick. Liang Shutang delivered the kick perfectly, allowing Luo Haiguang to head the ball in, making it 2-1 at the end of the first half.</p>
<p>Tit for Tat, Tense Situation In the second half, both</p>
<p>sides harbored the</p>
<p>ambition to win or die.</p>
<p>They attacked</p>
<p>and defended cautiously.</p>
<p>For ten minutes, no goals were scored. Suddenly, the opponent's right-wing forward advanced aggressively, leaving their defense vulnerable. Yang Mingjin was isolated and helpless, causing the spectators to worry. Fortunately, Wang Shusen rushed out from midfield, turning danger into safety. Sun Jinshun passed the ball well, allowing Xiao Luo to make a great contribution. Three minutes later, Xiao Yun regrettably touched the ball with his hand in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Henston, despite his age, succeeded with one attempt.</p>
<p>7-2, Like Crushing Eggs Against Stone In the blink of an eye, Xi</p>
<p>Aiqiao received orders</p>
<p>from Li's central army,</p>
<p>sent the word west, as</p>
<p>if entering a deserted land, passing it in front of the goal. Sun Jinshun tapped it in, recovering</p>
<p>lost ground. Not five minutes later, Luo Haiguang broke through the enemy's sentry line, entangled with old Henston. Sun's Iron Leg, taking advantage of the opponent's unpreparedness, forcefully shot the ball into the goal. Zhong Yongsen unleashed his pace and, seizing the opportunity, passed it to his clanmate, Yuxiang, who gently flicked it into the net. At this time, the Jewish team's morale was unstable, and the players were panic-stricken. The defenders looked disheartened. In a moment of exasperation, Xiao Luo fired a cannon from afar, hitting the bullseye again. Shortly after, the sun set, the shadows scattered, the victory was decided, and the order to retreat was given.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Western Foreign Boyscouts of This City Hold Annual Meeting on Double Tenth Day <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Location: Western Foreign Boyscout Camp on Hongqiao Road</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Chinese Boyscout Troops to Attend</p>
<p>The foreign boyscouts of this city hold an annual meeting. Every autumn, they gather the boyscouts from various countries in the city in one place to perform various course performances and competitions. This year, it is scheduled to be held on October 10th at the Western Foreign Boyscout Camp on Hongqiao Road. The Western Foreign Boyscout Association had sent a letter to the City Boyscout Council inviting Chinese boyscouts to participate in the performance competition. In the past, Chinese boyscouts have participated four times. The City Boyscout Council believes that the performances and competitions of boyscouts should be organized by the boyscout council of the host country. Therefore, it is difficult to accept the invitation to participate in the performance. However, in order to maintain friendship with the foreign boyscouts of this city, it has been decided to send boyscouts to attend at that time. The notification has been sent to all troops. The attendance measures are briefly noted below: (1) Limited to one boyscout from each registered boyscout troop. (2) Before 1:00 PM on October 10th (originally scheduled for 8:00 AM, now changed to 1:00 PM), gather at the council to depart. (3) Participating servicemen must wear coats, shorts, and flat-brimmed hats. (4) Participants must register with the council by October 7th. Those who do not register will absolutely not be allowed to attend temporarily in the name of boyscouts.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Youth Association Reading Group Begins <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Director Pan Gongzhan Delivers a Sincere Speech</p>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Association previously organized a reading group to help young people study academic subjects and invited many well-known scholars to serve as advisors. All members who participated in the first three-month term were very satisfied. The second term began yesterday at 10:00 AM in the grand auditorium of the association at Eight Immortals Bridge. Director Pan of the Education Bureau and advisor Li Gongpu attended, as well as over one hundred members, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Director Pan said in his speech, "I am very pleased to attend the opening ceremony of the second term of the reading group today. When the organizers of the reading group initially sought my opinion, I considered it a very important organization. Society needs this kind of cultural work because the courses and schedules in schools are too fixed and inflexible. If we want to give ordinary people the opportunity to study and improve themselves, we must find remedial measures outside of school. Libraries and museums supplement the inadequacies of school education. The reading group organized by the Youth Association serves the same purpose. It is much nobler to use your spare time to study here than to do boring things, which waste time and energy. Reading a book always increases knowledge, which benefits not only individuals but also society and the nation. Therefore, from every perspective, we should support the reading group and hope that not only will the Youth Association continue to organize it this year, but that other places will also start organizing it, so that reading groups will flourish and expand day by day."</p>

<p>Tiehua Primary School, located on Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession, has made progress in both quantity and quality this semester after its new school building was completed and facilities were added. Therefore, it has been approved for registration by the Education Bureau. Now, the school is opening a sports field of several acres across the street in Dunhou Lane. Sports equipment such as balance beams, seesaws, swings, and slides are fully equipped and will soon be completed. It is reported that the school principal, Lu Tiemin, believes that these various innovations are largely due to the assistance of Chairman and School Director Du Yuesheng, so he plans to welcome Mr. Du to visit the school for inspection in the coming days.</p>

<h3 id="e179">The 1954 World Education Conference (3) <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>1. Establishment of a World Peace Committee to liaise with educational organizations in various countries, coordinate groups established in various countries around the world to achieve peace, and investigate and research effective and appropriate methods for achieving world peace through education. 2. A committee to investigate the current situation of history professors in the world. 3. A committee on international sports competitions. 4. A committee on mediation mechanisms. 5. A military education investigation committee. 6. A committee to investigate the theory that war is inevitable. 7. Establishment of a committee to investigate the relationship between the Hague Tribunal and the International Court of Justice and world education. Each committee will report the results of its investigations to the United Education Association, which will establish effective and appropriate strategies based on these reports.</p>
<p>The World United Education Association adopted this article at its first Edinburgh meeting. For the sake of convenience, five of the above-listed committees were attached to the Harman Charton Committee, namely: Part 1, Peace Education Department; Part 2, History Education Department; Part 3, International Sports Competition Department; Part 4, Military Education Department; Part 5, International Mediation Department. The departments of this committee will meet at each session. During the conferences of the general assembly, departments, and the Harman Charton Committee, educators from various countries around the world gather together to give speeches on various educational issues and report on the results of their investigations. In addition, representative conferences are held.</p>
<p>The representative conference is a conference composed of representatives from various countries and is the highest decision-making body in the World United Education Association. The election of directors, the determination of resolutions, and the amendment of constitutions and regulations are all carried out by the representative conference. The resolutions of each department and the Harman Charton Committee are organized by the resolution drafting committee, and the resolution of the World United Education Association is drafted, which is then reported to the representative conference. After being resolved by the representative conference, the resolution of the World United Education Association is formally published.</p>
<p>3. The 1935 World Education Conference and Japan. This World Education Conference will be held in Japan. Japanese educators believe that this conference is of great importance to Japan's great development during this extraordinary period. This can be explained from several aspects. In terms of international relations, since the "September 18th Incident," Japan has defied the world, abandoned its long-standing friendly facade, revealed its ferocious nature, brazenly occupied the three northeastern provinces, undermined world peace, violated the Nine-Power Treaty, and, during the "January 28th Incident," displayed its brutal bestiality in the prosperous</p>
<p>Shanghai. Ignoring everything, it resolutely withdrew from the League of Nations. In short, what Japan has shown to the world in recent years is nothing but the wild silkworm's habit of exhausting its resources in military expansion. The impression of Japan in Europe, America, and other parts of the world is entirely a picture of ferocity and greed. Moreover, Japan's diplomacy in recent years has often been in a state of isolation. Although Foreign Minister Hirota has recently advocated so-called "cooperative diplomacy," he has still been unable to break out of the isolated situation. This phenomenon is a great obstacle to Japan's national strength. In any case, Japan, because of the ambition of a few warlords, does not hesitate to be at odds with the world, which is the most foolish behavior. Therefore, the Japanese authorities, taking this into consideration, in order to shift the negative impressions of Japan held by Europeans and Americans, to avoid international disputes, and to break the international isolation, hope to use the most appropriate methods during this World Education Conference to carry out various propaganda activities, cover up Japan's ferocity and cruelty, and seek the understanding and sympathy of people from various countries. This is the diplomatic role that Japan hopes to play in the conference. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e180">God's Chosen Sons <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>I am not a narrow-minded person, but when I see the arrogant and domineering attitude of those people with high noses, green eyes, and blond hair, I always feel uncomfortable in my heart. I often wonder what they have to be proud of other than their high noses, green eyes, and blond hair. Stripped of the clothes they use to flaunt their gentlemanly manners, they are originally hairy people, and in terms of the degree of human evolution, they are at least two thousand years behind the Chinese. Leaving aside these gentlemen, and going further down the scale, to the sailors who come to China, we can often see conspicuous tattoos on their bodies - some are tattooed with anchors, some with men and women embracing - which is no different from the tattoos on the bodies of Chinese secret society members. If [tattooing] is a custom left over from savages, then how can these people, who see themselves as the most civilized, have savage customs? From the anthropological point of view, we must know that no matter how advanced a nation's culture is, there are still many remnants of barbarism from primitive times in its cultural characteristics. People with a broader vision and a fairer attitude will never deny a nation's entire culture simply because there are certain remnants of barbarism in that nation's culture. However, white people who come to the East are not like that. Their biased attitude and naive views are really annoying to see. They always think that they are God's chosen sons, and that their culture is also the most superior. As soon as they see that a certain cultural characteristic of China is different from theirs, they think it is either very mysterious or too barbaric.</p>
<p>Even in terms of eating, if you have been in contact with a white person for a long time, he will ask you with a curious and contemptuous tone: [Do Chinese people eat mice and snakes? Is this really the case]? If you are from Fujian or Guangdong and you answer yes, then he will simply be as if he has discovered a miracle, thinking that this is an incredible thing - if you are not from Fujian or Guangdong, and you answer him [I don't know, at least I don't eat them], then he simply considers you a liar, intentionally concealing the secrets of your country. We don't need to discuss the taste of snakes and mice, or whether they can or cannot be eaten. Even if eating snakes and mice is strange for people from Fujian and Guangdong, isn't eating snails by Europeans equally strange in the eyes of us Orientals?</p>
<p>Chinese food culture has its own standing and there is a definite conclusion about this. I remember a friend told me the following thing before (there is no doubt about the authenticity of this thing, maybe some exaggeration is inevitable): a few years ago, a few students from a certain university went to Germany to study. When the ship probably reached the Indian Ocean, it happened to be the Mid-Autumn Festival. Because the few students were tired of eating Western food, they wanted to eat Chinese food, so they went to the kitchen to discuss it, and asked to leave out a portion of raw chicken, fish, meat and vegetables for them to cook themselves. They cooked the dishes according to the Chinese method, the color was bright red, and the taste was also very good. The foreign cooks on the ship praised it greatly. In order to let the foreigners know the deliciousness of Chinese food, the few students specially left some for the cooks to eat. A fat, purulent head cook, who had just recovered from a minor illness, tore open a piece of chicken to taste it as soon as he saw the chicken dish with such good color. He discovered that Chinese food had a different flavor, so he ordered the other subordinates not to move and let him enjoy it alone. He also opened a few bottles of wine to help him enjoy it. After he was drunk and full and climbed onto a high bunk to sleep, whether he was too drunk or careless, he suddenly fell heavily from the bunk and broke his stomach and soon died.</p>
<p>The death of this head cook can prove the great magic power of Chinese food. China is at least no worse than others in terms of eating, but there are many people with high noses, green eyes, and blond hair who want to make trouble. I remember two years ago, a French reporter published an article in a famous foreign magazine saying that he was once invited by a Chinese person to dinner in Beijing. He felt that the house was too old, the cups and chopsticks were not clean enough, and the Chinese people's mixed eating habits were not in line with their customs. He thought that shark fins had no taste to speak of, so he felt that Chinese food had nothing to eat, and he used this as an excuse to rant and scold the Chinese. This kind of head facing big, ranting and raving, [farting, farting, really unreasonable] arrogant attitude. Are there only these kinds of things?</p>
<p>People who have traveled in Europe always feel that the blue-eyed people in Paris and Berlin are not as disgusting in their attitude as these people who come to the East. In fact, the attitude of these people who come to China is disgusting, and I am afraid that the Chinese have also cultivated half of it. The flattery of the compradors and foreign slaves is certainly enough to make them feel that they have suddenly risen a level. In addition, the so-called high-class Chinese in Shanghai welcome an inexplicable foreigner with particularly grand etiquette, which is also one of the reasons. A friend who came back from the United States once heard an American say to him: [White people in China are really God!] This is on the one hand a sign of the white people's pride, and on the other hand, it can be seen that the Chinese themselves are also to blame for the white people's pride.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Autumn <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Yingzi</p>
<p>Quietly, I picked up the diseased leaves brought down by the autumn wind and threw them into the tea stove; watching that spark of burning fire, I always had a feeling of waiting, as if I was hoping that a distant guest would come and chat with me while sipping tea. ...</p>
<p>Because I was a little sick, I had seven parts of leisure.</p>
<p>And these scattered days are not easy to have. People, probably always like to have a little leisure and fun, right? Although it is inevitably clear and chatty, but being quiet and peaceful is, after all, a good feeling for a heart that has been trampled on by life.</p>
<p>In order to covet the elegant and unrestrained beauty of the few parasol trees in the backyard, and the secluded location, I brought a set of tea sets and moved to this small study here to live. At the same time, I was also willing to be quietly in the study, savoring this rare tranquility.</p>
<p>[Parasol moon, pine breeze, banana rain, Tea stove, zither melody, sound of books]</p>
<p>Occasionally, I saw these two sentences on the tea canister and felt that they were quite similar to my situation today, so I asked someone to ask a calligrapher to write them and paste them on the wall. The gray wall was already decorated with many white spider nests.</p>
<p>Every day, I quietly brewed a pot of tea in such a scene with a feeling of waiting. ······</p>
<p>Time, also seemed to hang on the tail of a snail, so slowly, making people feel that it was not easy to wear away丨丨A sick and idle person probably has always experienced this feeling, right?</p>
<p>Especially, this situation makes people feel very empty.</p>
<p>The autumn wind was rustling from the parasol leaves. Outside the window, there was a curtain of quiet sunlight. When the wind passed, all sounds were silent, which I felt was some unbearable loneliness.</p>
<p>[Remember the small building,</p>
<p>Listening to the spring rain south of the Yangtze River all night,</p>
<p>Dreaming of the sound of the Xiao flute,</p>
<p>Flowing water, green duckweed,</p>
<p>Where is the old tour?]</p>
<p>When I silently recited the sentences of the lyricist Zhang Yutian in a tranquil and comfortable environment, I really didn't know where I was at this time. So, I often burned a furnace of good incense under the sunny window to savor [Legend] or [Ballad]. Leisurely, watching that wisp of rising green smoke, I would immerse my whole mind in the beautiful stories of love between men and women in those [Legends]. ······</p>
<p>At this time, the only thing that broke the silence was the sparse sound of tea in the stove.</p>
<p>And these simple and plain tones further intensified the silence of the surrounding air. At such times, I was often lost in thought, feeling that there was nothing to say.</p>
<h3 id="e182">On Naming Numbers <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Lengmo</p>
<p>The question I am raising is, the current numbering method is too cumbersome, how should it be reformed? I know that someone has proposed a reform method before, but it is still not very convenient, so I think it is best to create new characters. I have thought about it for a long time, and it seems that all four types of creation notes are possible. I am writing them out for everyone to study. If you think that one type is usable, I will be very happy. If all are rejected, then it is still one path. Below is the new proposed numbering table ··</p>
<p>Current Style: 个 十 百 千 万 十万 百万 十万万 百万万 千万万万 一百万万万万</p>
<p>Newly Proposed Characters: (Read Zhao) (Read Mi) (Read Di) (Read Qu)</p>
<p>Type A (From Ten): · · · Thousand (Or Dou) ·</p>
<p>Type B (From Thousand): · · · Thousand · · ·</p>
<p>Type C (From Ten Thousand): · · · · · · ·</p>
<p>Type D (From Zhao): · · · · · · · Billion Zhao Zhao</p>
<p>The last item in the current style, 百万万万万 (one hundred million million million), is obviously something that everyone finds unspeakable, but it is not an astronomical number, but is actually commonly used, i.e. Trillion in English and German, which can be used in statistics. What I am proposing here also ends with this word, but even larger ones can be inferred by analogy, because the proposed words all have a certain rule.</p>
<p>Type A is derived from IXON in Western science. Because the pronunciation of the original method is inconvenient and does not harmonize with the common concept of three-digit increments, it has been changed to a Chinese-style word and only takes three digits. Originally, K, O, etc. could be used directly, but it does not seem like a Chinese word and may be difficult to circulate. This type A is privately thought to be the most direct.</p>
<p>Type B is purely based on three increments (the square power of a thousand), and seems to be the easiest to write.</p>
<p>Type C relies on ten thousand increments, although it is slightly simpler, it is still cumbersome.</p>
<p>Type D can be said to be a translation of the Western numbering method. The word 兆 (Zhao) was used in the old ten thousand increment method to mean 十万万万 (one hundred million), but it was not widely used, so it still does not hinder it from being used as a million in the original decimal method; moreover, the phrase 四百兆 (四万万) 同胞 (four hundred million compatriots) is very popular, which helps its accuracy. This 兆 (Zhao) is equivalent to Lion in Western languages. I have not checked the etymology of the word Lion, but judging from the literal meaning, it seems to represent a number of one thousand times one thousand, so Million is one (Mi) one thousand times one thousand, Billion is the square of Lion (British and German methods are different, Trillion is the cube of Lion. Two words equivalent to it are created in Type D, and because Chinese is easy to combine, two words are created that are in between the three numbers. Further, the above can be inferred by analogy, or only Zhao increments can be used.</p>
<p>No matter which type is used, the pronunciation is proposed as above. 兆 (Zhao) is original, 密 (Mi) takes the first sound of the English and German word Milliardo, 蒂 (Di) takes the first sound of Billion, and 屈 (Qu) takes TriIIion. 蒂 (Di) then takes the changing sound of the word Thousand in 千乘兆兆 (thousand times Zhao times Zhao) or can read the ( ? ) proposed by Gao Mengdan.</p>
<p>Someone may answer that taking the sound of Western words is using Yi (foreigners) to change Xia (Chinese), but I feel that the most important thing about numbers is to show a clear concept. Instead of raising the sound of dead ancient words and making people confused, it is better to make many high school students and above understand the Western imagery and make it consistent. As for why only one sound is taken, one is for convenience, and the other is because the English and American meanings of the original word are different. Incomplete transliteration can avoid confusion. Third, meter is called 米 (Mi), and dozen is called 打 (Da). There are already precedents, and there is no inconvenience, so it can be imitated.</p>
<p>Scientists are the most courageous in creating new words, such as 气 (Qi), 腺 (Xian), etc. These words are good and convenient. The current arithmetic also clearly lacks a new word, and it is right to create a new word. I think this statement, at least scientists may not object.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Mr. Township Chief (21) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>Please, brothers, wait outside for a while! [When he arrived home, Shanfu said with a smile to those silent and lifeless Yellow Army soldiers. [But squad leader, please come into my house for a cup of tea!]</p>
<p>[That's good.] The squad leader turned around and said, [You watch the intersection and don't let him escape!]</p>
<p>Before the squad leader finished speaking, he followed Shanfu inside.</p>
<p>Shanfu leaned on the squad leader and took out a ten-yuan banknote from his underwear. 丨Just went to Yi Ningdu, took a risk, and brought a bag of soil; finally sold the soil and earned ten yuan! Although Shanfu felt heartache, at this moment, in order to escape, he had to transfer it to the squad leader. The squad leader took it unceremoniously. He said in a low voice, [You escape to the back of the earth mound.] Turning around, the squad leader himself, again strode out.</p>
<p>[Didn't that young man come out?] The squad leader said.</p>
<p>[·········] Everyone had no words.</p>
<p>[You damned things, didn't you let him escape丨? Damn! Damn! Hurry up and go again, catch another one, and don't go back for lunch. Catch them along the way!]</p>
<p>X X</p>
<p>Towards evening, Mr. Feng Wen dragged his shoes into Yusheng Company.</p>
<p>[Why? Didn't the squad leader come back for lunch?]</p>
<p>[No! Damn it, he caught Shanfu, and really didn't even come back for lunch.] He sat down and took a breath. [This hurdle is finally over. Half of the burden has been put down. Ha ha ha!]</p>
<p>[The burden is behind, don't be happy!] Mr. Dasheng pursed his lips and smiled.</p>
<p>Yes! Yes!] Dong Sheng seemed to be talking to someone else, and then limped into Yusheng Company. [Damn it, good, If the husband hadn't been captured, I would have been taken away. His wife cried to my house, wanting me to return the person. I said, go to the township chief to ask for it, she didn't dare to come.] Dong Sheng spat out a lot of air and said a lot, then stopped, as if he couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>What? Wasn't Shanfu caught? I was standing far away and saw him being caught in that pavilion.] Township Chief Feng Wen narrowed his eyes, not knowing what was going on.</p>
<p>[Yes! Yes!] Dong Sheng's 瘤乎's details were presented again. [Shanfu gave this number and was released. The husband gave out artillery for the number. Damn it, damn it, really damn it! Hahaha! This time, the artillery is really going to fight foreigners.]</p>
<p>Mr. Dasheng raised his chin again. Shaking his head, he thought. 丨Seriously seriously.</p>
<p>Then let's do this. Mr. Dasheng said. [Since Shoufu's artillery has touched bad luck and been captured, but he is not going to..., give him fifteen yuan a month. In addition to this, there are a few more yuan in the total amount we donated. Ah Wen, just consider it as your supply fee.]</p>

<p>Since its founding, this publication has been running for nearly two years, and it has consistently taken the initiation and promotion of new medicine and the advancement of national health as its mission. However, due to the limited talent and knowledge of our colleagues, we are concerned about potential oversights. We now specifically welcome both official reports and private investigations. We require accurate materials and detailed reports. Once received, they will be published immediately, and a small fee will be provided to express our gratitude.

<h3 id="e186">The Importance of Tuberculosis Among School Children in Shanghai City (Part 1) <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ting'an</p>
<p>Tuberculosis among school children in Shanghai City is relevant not only to students in school but also to children at home. This can be discussed in three points. Before discussing these points, let us first introduce:</p>
<p>What is Tuberculosis?</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is caused by infection with the tuberculosis bacillus. If we have tuberculosis and the sputum we cough up undergoes a specific procedure, many red rod-shaped bacteria can be detected. These bacteria are called tuberculosis bacilli. When they invade our lungs, they can eat away at our lungs and damage blood vessels, causing bleeding. Mild cases may go unnoticed, with the patient appearing normal. Later, as the ulcers grow larger and toxins spread, the face becomes pale and thin, weight decreases, and fever often occurs in the afternoon with an elevated body temperature. Normal body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius, while tuberculosis patients often have temperatures ranging from 37.5 to 38 degrees Celsius. Children at this stage are prone to anger. Further ulceration leads to coughing, but not frequently, only one or two coughs at a time. In severe cases, there is bleeding, emaciation, and cold sweats (sweating without being hot). At this point, the lung ulcers are larger, and the patient becomes a mere skeleton, a "tuberculosis ghost!" This is the third stage of tuberculosis and is very difficult to cure. Upon examination by a doctor, highly abnormal localized symptoms are found in the lungs, and X-rays can reveal the damaged areas. Bacterial examination will reveal tuberculosis bacilli. Tuberculosis is easily treated in its early stages. The first stage is still treatable, but by the third stage, there is little that can be done. Tuberculosis bacilli entering the intestines cause intestinal tuberculosis, and entering the skin causes skin tuberculosis. They can grow anywhere, but the lungs are their favorite place to reside.</p>
<p>The symptoms of tuberculosis usually include the aforementioned fever, cough, and cold sweats; however, some cases involve direct bleeding without going through these processes, which are atypical symptoms. In our country, 400 out of every 100,000 people die from tuberculosis each year. With a population of 400 million, a simple calculation shows that a total of 1.6 million "tuberculosis ghosts" are produced each year! The Japanese massacre of our compatriots during the Battle of Shanghai was temporary, but deaths from tuberculosis occur every year, making this issue worthy of study. A century ago, the United Kingdom was like our country, with 400 out of every 100,000 people dying from tuberculosis each year. Now, only 80 people die each year, a reduction to one-fifth. This indicates the development of public health and a decrease in infectious diseases. This is the first point I want to discuss with everyone.</p>
<p>The Status of Tuberculosis Among School Children in Shanghai City</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the topic at hand, the status of tuberculosis among school children in Shanghai City. Last year, the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association was established in Shanghai to promote anti-tuberculosis work because we learned that this issue is very important and that victory over "tuberculosis ghosts" is very achievable. Based on past experience, various countries have won battles, and our country should be no exception. Therefore, the Bureau of Health and the Bureau of Education cooperated to conduct a tuberculosis screening test called the "Tuberculin Test." The test method involves drying the bacteria, grinding them into powder, mixing them with saline, placing the mixture in a glass bottle, drawing a small amount with a syringe, and injecting it under the skin, causing a blister to form. After several hours, those without tuberculosis show no reaction, while those with tuberculosis show significant redness in the area. This is a method to test whether we have tuberculosis. Last autumn, the Bureau of Health specifically invited Dr. Gao Jinglang to conduct tuberculosis screenings at the Municipal Bide School. A total of 822 students were tested, of whom 542 had a positive reaction, proving that more than 60% had tuberculosis. Therefore, the parents of these 542 students were advised to have X-rays taken at the Red Cross Hospital at a reduced cost. In total, 129 agreed to be examined, and the results sent to the hospital for treatment showed that 33 were severe, 57 were mild, and 34 were very mild. If all 542 people had been examined, there would have been 15 very severe cases and 100 severe cases. From this, we discovered several issues worthy of research:</p>
<p>1. The patients themselves, those with severe illnesses, continue to attend school, which will likely lead to death in the future. Therefore, teachers should focus on nurturing rather than solely on teaching. In the past, emphasis was placed on teaching rather than nurturing, neglecting the students' health, which had a significant impact on their well-being. This is in stark contrast to Director Pan's idea of integrating education and nurturing. Gentlemen, you have spent a lot of energy teaching a class of students, but unfortunately, they die, which is very unworthy. Therefore, I hope we can implement Director Pan's principle of combining teaching and nurturing. What has been said above is based on the statistical finding that the first harm of tuberculosis is to the physical health and academic progress of school children. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Overview of Medical and Health Conditions in Anqing (Part 2)</p>
<p>— Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>(4) Group Activities and Academic Research of New and Old Medicine</p>
<p>The members of the new medicine community have mostly received higher education from the state. Naturally, they have a clear understanding of groups. The new medicine community in Anqing has organized the Huaining County Medical Association, with approximately 50 members. Those in charge of the association are able to work together sincerely, and the external influence is still very strong.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, the old medicine community had already established the "Chinese Medicine Association." Although the name of an academic organization was used, it still involved the work of a professional association. In 1930, the tide of medical revolution promoted by new medicine was surging, and the nationwide call for changing the name of Chinese medicine to national medicine was deafening. During that period, the Chinese Medicine Association in Anqing was brewing to change its name to the "National Medicine Association." Due to the lack of understanding of groups among the old medicine members, it was not until this spring that it slowly and painfully emerged. The total number of members is about one hundred or so. However, the organization is loose, the work is lax, the opinions are complex, and the funding is insufficient, showing no vitality at all. Although there are a few enthusiastic people who are actively carrying out everything, as the saying goes, "One tree cannot support a tall building," they are also powerless.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, Anqing had established an official medical bureau, which was managed by old medicine practitioners. After the success of the National Revolution, the Anhui provincial government established a relief hospital and changed the name of the old official medical bureau to a medical service center, which was subordinate to the relief hospital. At this time, the content of the medical service center was different from before, and the medical services were shared by new and old medicine practitioners.</p>
<p>Speaking of academic organizations, there are very few in Anqing. In 1932, the author and well-known local medical professionals such as Mr. Yin Zizheng organized an "Oriental Medical Research Association" and successively published "Medical Innovation" and "Medical Weekly" in the Anqing "Republic of China Daily" and "Xin Wan Duo Bao," which were able to arouse the attention of the society. During that time, the Huaining County Medical Association once took charge of the "Medical Special Issue" and the Jiansheng Hospital published the "Jiansheng Medical Report." Unfortunately, they were all limited by personnel changes and insufficient financial resources, and eventually disappeared like a flash in the pan. Even now, thinking back, there is still lingering pain!</p>
<p>Attached is a list of medical and pharmaceutical publications:</p>
<p>Jiansheng Medical Report</p>
<p>Editors: Wu Jiansheng, et al.</p>
<p>Publisher: Jiansheng Hospital</p>
<p>Medical Bi-Weekly</p>
<p>Editor: Oriental Medical Research Association</p>
<p>Publisher: Anhui Republic of China Daily</p>
<p>Medical Weekly</p>
<p>Editors: Zhang Yao, Yin Zizheng, Jiang Huiming, et al.</p>
<p>Publisher: Anqing Xin Wan Duo Bao Daily</p>
<p>Medical Special Issue</p>
<p>Editor: Huaining County Medical Association</p>
<p>Publisher: Anqing Wan Bao Newspaper</p>
<p>(5) Investigation of Anqing Hospitals and Author's Opinions</p>
<p>The development of new medicine in Anqing to what it is today is largely due to the hard work and struggle of the new medicine comrades in Anqing. It is indeed not easy. The atmosphere in Anqing in the early years of the Republic of China was quite conservative. When new medicine practitioners gave injections to patients, those patients would be genuinely frightened and run away. Of course, there are no such jokes now. However, the shortage of doctors and the uneven level of doctors in such an environment do not allow us to be too demanding. However, there is something that the author cannot condone from my new medicine comrades in Anqing, and that is that there are too many hospitals in Anqing that do not live up to their names. Especially in recent years, in the process of the vigorous development of new medicine in Anqing, the rise of hospitals is also like bamboo shoots after a rain. Those who can establish clinics in a down-to-earth manner are only the Cheng Liming Clinic and the Xinglin Treatment Center. Is this a good phenomenon after all? Looking at the hospital management regulations promulgated by the state, there are too many places that do not conform. New medicine comrades who aspire to and love new medicine, please pay attention to the true value of being legitimate and well-founded. Do not ignore the overall problem of new medicine and society in the future.</p>
<p>I believe that it is more appropriate for our new medicine practitioners to establish specialized clinics in Anqing in the future. Because Anqing lacks specialist doctors. We want to improve patients' belief in new medicine and break the stereotype that new medicine is good at surgery and old medicine is good at internal medicine. Only specialized technology can show the essence and value of science.</p>
<p>(6) Business Conditions of New and Old Pharmaceutical Industries</p>
<p>Before 1931, the old pharmaceutical industry was quite prosperous. Because Anqing had not suffered any major devastation since the floods of 1901, including the various recoveries and the Northern Expedition. All businesses were able to flourish, and the old pharmaceutical industry was no exception. In 1931, the great flood in the Yangtze River flooded the farmland in various counties along the Yangtze River in Anhui, causing the rural areas to go bankrupt and the business to be depressed. Also, due to the increasingly tight financial situation in the inland, the old pharmaceutical industry was also greatly affected. Generally, the largest wholesale pharmacies had difficulty collecting accounts from rural towns. For retail pharmacies, the most profitable were ginseng, bird's nest, and ointment pills. Generally, middle-class families practiced thrift and did not prescribe tonics, so the business income was also greatly reduced. According to statistics, there are about seventy to eighty old pharmacies of various sizes in the city, but the size of the business also varies greatly. The largest pharmacies can reach an annual business volume of forty to fifty thousand yuan.</p>
<p>On the surface, the new pharmaceutical industry seems to be thriving, but in reality, it is also suffering from the setbacks of natural disasters, resulting in a strong exterior but a weak interior. There are indeed very few with real strength. There are only fourteen new pharmacies in the city. Besides selling some over-the-counter drugs, medical devices, and all kinds of cosmetics, only Huayang and Pu Bo Li pharmacies can fill prescriptions for doctors. However, there has not been a formally licensed pharmacist in charge of filling prescriptions, which is indeed a regret for the new medical and pharmaceutical community in Anqing. As for the business volume of large pharmacies, each can reach more than ten thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The business competition between the new and old pharmaceutical industries is not tense in Anqing. The old pharmaceutical industry established the "Pharmaceutical Industry Association" very early. In recent years, the new pharmaceutical industry has also organized the "Pharmaceutical Industry Association." In terms of spirit, the new Pharmaceutical Industry Association is more energetic; in terms of funding, the old Pharmaceutical Industry Association is more sufficient. There was once a rumor that the new and old pharmaceutical groups were merging, but this has not yet been realized.</p>
<p>(7) Conclusion</p>
<p>What is written above is just a microcosm of the medical and health situation in Anqing. It is certainly not enough to be regarded as documentary material. When the author concludes this article, in addition to hoping that people from all over the world who are concerned about medicine and health will provide more such materials for reference, I also hope that enthusiastic people in medicine and health can formulate a form that lists the points that need to be understood, divides them into categories, and distributes them to local medical associations or health agencies or private individuals to fill in. I think the future gains will be more orderly and meet the needs of the standard. Medical and health experts who sympathize with our requirements, please work together!</p>
<h3 id="e187">Common Knowledge Questions and Answers on Diseases <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(4)(10)(1) Gastroptosis and Gastric Atony</p>
<p>(Question) What is gastroptosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is a disease in which the position of the stomach is lower than its normal position.</p>
<p>(Question) How can gastroptosis occur?</p>
<p>(Answer) People with weak constitutions, women who wear tight corsets, those whose upper abdomen is compressed, those with reduced abdominal pressure, women after childbirth, or patients with ascites after puncture, pendulous abdomen, excessive fat, and people with weak abdominal muscles are all prone to gastroptosis.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms after gastroptosis occurs?</p>
<p>(Answer) No matter how obvious the degree of prolapse, it does not cause any particular obstacles. However, patients feel pressure, fullness, belching, vomiting, and stomach pain. It is also accompanied by gastric motility disorders or secretion disorders.</p>
<p>(Question) What can be seen on the outside of the abdomen?</p>
<p>(Answer) The patient's upper abdomen is sunken, while the area below the navel is very bulging.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the abnormalities during palpation?</p>
<p>(Answer) When the bulging abdomen is suddenly touched with a finger, a clear fluctuating sound can be heard.</p>
<p>(Question) What other diseases can be complicated?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is mostly complicated by gastric atony and gastrectasis. It can also be complicated by gastroptosis and enteroptosis.</p>
<p>(Question) What medicines should be taken and how should attention be paid to diet when treating gastroptosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) The patient's physique should be strengthened first, and tonics such as arsenic preparations and quinine preparations can be taken internally. For diet, nutritious and small portions should be selected, and each time, one should not eat or drink as much as possible to reduce the burden on the stomach.</p>
<p>(Question) Are there any physical therapy methods to treat this gastroptosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes. Like applying an abdominal belt to elevate the stomach; or using electrotherapy, massage, and hydrotherapy to make the abdominal muscles and stomach muscles tense and strong; all can be tried.</p>
<p>(Question) Can it be treated with surgery?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is a gastropexy in surgery, which may be performed.</p>
<p>(Question) What is gastric atony?</p>
<p>(Answer) A symptom of flaccid and weak muscles in the stomach wall.</p>
<p>(Question) How does this gastric atony occur?</p>
<p>(Answer) Some are congenital, some are caused by overeating, which leads to overwork or flaccidity of the stomach muscles, and some are caused by repeated childbirths.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms of gastric atony?</p>
<p>(Answer) Patients often experience food stagnation, fermentation, and decay. There are fluctuating sounds in the stomach, and there are also symptoms of autointoxication, such as headache, heaviness, neurological discomfort, measles, slow or excited heart rate, terror, chest tightness, and dizziness. Severe gastric atony is easily complicated by gastrectasis. Or it may be combined with gastroptosis.</p>
<p>(Question) How should the treatment method for gastric atony be?</p>
<p>(Answer) It can be treated according to the method for gastroptosis. If putrefaction and fermentation occur in the stomach, or if autointoxication occurs, gastric lavage should be performed, and antiseptic and disinfectant agents such as Resoroin and Salo () should be taken internally.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Common Treatment Methods for Fever (Part 2) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>If the fever is not too high, there is no need to take antipyretic drugs or use other methods to reduce the fever. If the fever is too high, appropriate methods can be used to reduce the fever to avoid extreme damage to the body. A low-grade fever is beneficial to the disease. The most common febrile diseases are tuberculosis, typhoid fever, heart inflammation, pneumonia, empyema, throat inflammation, appendicitis, or any part of the body with pus or sores. Pus-producing diseases, appendicitis, etc., on the one hand, need surgical resection, and on the other hand, they also need common treatment methods. Common treatment methods are like a country defending against foreign insults, which must first strengthen its national power. In addition to specific symptomatic treatment, common treatment methods are suitable for any fever. In particular, pulmonary tuberculosis, typhoid fever, pneumonia, and heart inflammation require extra attention to common treatment methods. Whether or not common treatment is used has a great relationship with whether these diseases turn from death to life. And if the patient understands this medical theory, the common treatment method can be done by himself. The common treatment methods are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Quiet Rest</p>
<p>Even if the fever is not too high, you must rest quietly, because there is a kind of war in the body. It is certainly not easy to know how intense the war will be in the future. The body is like a country that must prepare for a long-term war when it encounters an invader. A strong national power and sufficient preparation can lead to final victory. Is the body not the same? If the body's initial killing power against invading bacteria is very fierce, but it completely loses its resistance in the end, even a very minor problem can lead to death. We often see patients whose condition is very mild, but because they have no resistance, they often die. Therefore, at the beginning of the disease, rest quietly to cultivate the body's ability to resist bacteria and allow all the cells of the body to fully participate in the battle. If the resistance is sufficient, even a serious illness can be easily revived.</p>
<p>Someone asked, what does quiet rest actually mean? Quiet rest means this: people with fever should rest in bed day and night 丨丨Not just resting in bed, there should be comprehensive nursing. The bed should feel comfortable, not moving too much, and bowel movements should be done in bed. The bedroom must have fresh air, and do not [be afraid of being blown by the wind]. It must be known that fresh air is of great benefit to people without illness. Isn’t it even more important to people who are sick? As long as there is no strong wind blowing directly, it will not harm the patient. Fresh air will not harm people. Once I was invited to see a doctor, and when I arrived at a house, a woman had a normal postpartum fever. No one in the family took care of her, only a maid served her. The woman started to have a fever in the morning, and the doors and windows of the front building where she lived were tightly closed (the weather was still hot in autumn). The patient's fever gradually increased until she became comatose. Her maid then told the neighbors. The neighbors then volunteered to ask me to come. When I arrived in the house, I felt stuffy and hot, and the patient's temperature was 107 degrees. Later, her obstetrician arrived, and I left. Later, I heard that the woman died that night. If there was fresh air in the room, the temperature would not have risen to 107 degrees so suddenly. This is just one example. I think many people know a common chemical experiment. That is, covering a burning candle with a large glass bottle, and the candle flame will immediately become smaller and go out. People without illness need fresh air to survive, so do people with serious illnesses need fresh air ten or a hundred times more?</p>
<p>When the patient is resting quietly, someone also needs to take care of him so that he does not catch cold after sweating. Wet clothes must be carefully changed. The patient also needs to wash his body once or twice a day. For the body washing method, use a towel with warm water to wash the patient part by part with soap, and then wipe it dry with a dry towel. Clean skin can help the body excrete waste. In addition to washing the body, rubbing the back with alcohol every night can prevent bedsores from developing on the back after lying down for a long time. Help the patient turn over several times a day to prevent pneumonia from developing in the lower part of the lungs (especially important for the elderly). The bed sheets on which the patient lies should always be flattened, and there should not be a single wrinkle.</p>
<p>Quiet rest is not only for the body to rest, but also for the mind to rest. Patients should put all thoughts of self-interest aside.</p>
<p>. If the fever is not high and you are resting in bed for a long time, some beneficial hobbies are also okay. Especially those who are resting for a long time due to pulmonary tuberculosis or heart disease, it is also good to spend some time learning natural science, foreign languages, shorthand, basket weaving, or hand weaving during the day. As for games that involve competition, they are harmful to the body and should not be done, because they can easily make the patient too tired.</p>
<p>People with fever must have adequate sleep. Adequate sleep has a great relationship with the future recovery. If the patient does not get enough sleep at night, he can be asked to sleep during the day. If the patient's environment is particularly quiet, it is probably not difficult to sleep. When recuperating at home, you must pay attention to the patient's environment and ensure that it is quiet. If there is really no way to sleep, you can take a small amount of sleeping pills. If the fever is too high and the patient is unconscious, one or two people must always be by the bedside to prevent the patient from falling off the bed or other unfortunate accidents from happening.

<h3 id="e189">A Brief Introduction to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (24) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 8 Clinical Examination Methods</p>
<p>If someone has already found some, or even all, of the various symptoms described in the previous chapter, then is there no doubt that this person has pulmonary tuberculosis? Of course, it won't be that simple. We must know that the general symptoms of this disease, such as weight loss, poor appetite, and pale complexion, this kind of latent process, can be imagined or speculated, but it is not inevitable. Measuring the daily temperature is considered the most reliable; but for a type that starts acutely, it is still indistinguishable from a common cold, and other symptoms can be deduced from this. If we want to solve this major doubt, (whether it is pulmonary tuberculosis without a doubt?) that is, in addition to the subjective symptoms described by the patient, the doctor should also re-evaluate and try to prove it from an objective perspective; the various details in this are the clinical examination methods described in this chapter! Taking a step back, even if the disease has been correctly diagnosed based on a few symptoms, this procedure cannot be omitted. Readers, please remember that it was mentioned in the fifth chapter that this disease has several classifications due to different pathological and anatomical properties; the prognosis in this regard is different, and the treatment is also different. For example, metal preparations and tuberculin for this disease are very suitable for chronic proliferative types, but they are not suitable if it is an exudative acute start. The success of artificial pneumothorax in treating this disease is well-known; but for this disease with too wide an area of infiltration and too many cavities, it is still necessary to think twice before acting. This kind of judgment of whether or not can not be done based on the subjective symptoms described by the patient; clinical examination methods such as percussion, auscultation, and X-ray examination can not be omitted at this time. This kind of work, on the surface, looks very trivial, but it is actually discerning and worthy of [seeing the essence through the appearance] without shame.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Common Sense on Ear, Nose, Throat and Eye Hygiene <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(18) Trachoma</p>
<p>If trachoma reaches a significant degree and is not treated, various dangerous symptoms and complications will arise. I will now briefly discuss them separately, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Trachomatous Pannus: This is the most common and easily occurring primary sign in trachoma. Its cause is due to the excessive depth of trachoma. The surface of the cornea (commonly known as the "eye black") gradually becomes cloudy. The epithelium of the cornea also proliferates simultaneously. On the other hand, new blood vessels form, so the appearance of pannus is a fleshy, grayish-white color with blood streaks. Its location begins at the upper edge of the cornea and gradually progresses downward. Once it encroaches upon the pupillary area, the patient will immediately experience vision impairment. If the entire cornea is affected, it is equivalent to blindness.</p>
<p>(2) Corneal Ulcer: Often occurs on the edge of the cornea or concurrently with pannus. It develops at the junction with healthy cornea. After this type of ulcer heals, it often leaves behind opacity, impairing vision.</p>
<p>(3) Eyelid Curvature and Ingrown Eyelashes: If trachoma is not treated properly in its mild stages, the conjunctiva and cartilage may contract due to scarring in the future, causing the eyelid to curve. At this time, eyelashes often grow inward, irritating the cornea and causing inflammation. Or, on the upper eyelid, entropion (inward turning of the eyelid) may occur; on the lower eyelid, ectropion (outward turning of the eyelid) may occur.</p>
<p>(4) Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (Dry Eye): Because of conjunctival atrophy, its secretory function disappears, and tear production gradually decreases. Its viscosity also increases. At this time, the patient's eyes feel dry, and the surface of the cornea becomes thickened, dry, and opaque. If patients with trachoma develop this dry eye condition, it is very difficult to cure. Even if the patient has already become blind, this feeling of dryness is still unavoidable.</p>
<p>(5) Corneal Nebula: When pannus gradually absorbs and returns to transparency, corneal nebula often remains.</p>
<p>(6) Ptosis (Drooping Upper Eyelid): We often see that the upper eyelids of patients with trachoma often droop. Their eyes seem to be closed all day long.</p>
<p>Whether the prognosis of trachoma is good or bad is a difficult question to answer. It depends entirely on the severity of trachoma, the timing of treatment, whether the treatment is appropriate, and the patient's patience, etc. Therefore, sometimes it can be completely cured, sometimes it leaves behind vision impairment or complications, and sometimes dangerous symptoms gradually worsen and lead to blindness.</p>
<p>The prevention of trachoma can be divided into two types: broad and narrow. The narrow sense of prevention is that individuals pay attention to eye hygiene, such as (1) not using public towels and washbasins; (2) not getting too close to relatives and friends who have trachoma. Direct or indirect transmission of trachoma must be avoided. As for the broad sense of prevention, its scope is even wider. It is (1) the government must take the lead in promoting [how to eradicate this shameful national disease]; (2) social leaders are responsible for implementing publicity work, with the same spirit as handling the prevention and treatment of cholera in the summer; (3) school authorities must supervise school doctors to examine students for trachoma. If there is mild trachoma, they should be instructed to receive treatment. If it is severe, they should be temporarily suspended from school and sent home to seek medical treatment, so as to avoid transmission among classmates. We know that students are important building blocks of the country and also the future representatives of the country. If they are all infected with trachoma, wouldn't they become trachoma building blocks and the future trachomatous representatives of the country? This is a very painful and shameful thing. Therefore, I want to advise school authorities to pay more attention to the prevention of trachoma. Speaking of which, it may be more important than guiding education. (4) Responsible personnel in prisons and factories should also implement trachoma prevention, because people are crowded and it is easier to spread the disease.</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment of trachoma, it can generally be divided into two types: drug treatment and surgical treatment. Its main purposes are (1) to minimize damage to the conjunctiva; (2) to minimize damage to physiological functions; (3) to prevent scarring; (4) to avoid corneal complications; and (5) to reduce inflammation and its secretions. Regarding drug treatment, it is not necessarily to be treated by an ophthalmologist. Most regular doctors can treat it. If drug treatment cannot achieve the desired cure, then surgical treatment should be performed by an ophthalmologist. The most suitable time for surgery is when the inflammation has subsided, secretions have decreased, conjunctival congestion and opacity have subsided, and granules have appeared in a limited area, etc. The purpose of surgery is to fundamentally remove the pathological products of trachoma and to preserve the physiological function of the conjunctiva. Its methods include cauterization, expression, crushing, pressing, and wiping, etc. Regarding the question of which method is better, it must of course be determined by a doctor after examining the condition.</p>
<p>(Corrigendum) In the previous issue, the "驗" (yàn - examination) in "眼臉之驗" (examination of the eyelids) was misprinted as "臉" (liǎn - face), and the "所" (suǒ - that which) in "所以在臨床上觀察砂眼起來之所" (that which is observed clinically in the development of trachoma) was misprinted as "可" (kě - can).</p>
<h3 id="e191">Introduction to [New Book on Childhood Infectious Diseases] <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Siru</p>
<p>Mr. Gao Naolang, director of the pediatrics department of the Red Cross Hospital, has recently written a book entitled [Childhood Infectious Diseases]. The content is very rich. According to the editor, the motivation for writing this book has been long in the making. Initially, he planned to choose a good foreign pediatric textbook and translate several thousand words a day, estimating that it would be completed in about a year. However, after careful examination of various European and American pediatric textbooks, none were satisfactory. If he were to arbitrarily modify them during translation, it would lack credibility. This is because foreign pediatric textbooks generally have two characteristics: first, they each seek to apply to the specific conditions of their own country; and second, the authors specialize in certain diseases, and their descriptions of those conditions are particularly detailed. This is certainly the highlight of each book, but when transferred to our country, it immediately loses its luster. Our country is vast and populous, and the climate and geography are vastly different in the north and south. Customs and habits also vary in the east and west. The types of diseases and their distribution, the course of the disease, and the prognosis all differ within the country. Compared to foreign countries, the differences are even more numerous. Therefore, he changed his approach and decided to compile his own book in order to make it applicable.</p>
<p>The editor also said that from a historical perspective, although the progress of our country's scientific medicine should be faster, it has already made great strides compared to thirty years ago. Moreover, there are quite a few clinicians in various places who are devoted to research. If he were to compile his own book, this most valuable local material could be adopted. The difficulty is that there is no systematic index of such medical books and articles in the country for reference. On the one hand, the time available for writing each day is limited. Collecting materials is time-consuming and energy-consuming. The effort is far greater than translation. Moreover, he did not dare to immediately publish the first draft, but put it aside for revisions for more than a year. This is why the publication was delayed.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into three volumes. The first volume is on bacterial infectious diseases, with 19 chapters. The second volume is on animal infectious diseases, with 18 chapters. The third volume is on special infectious diseases, which include those caused by filterable viruses and those whose pathogens are not yet known, with 14 chapters. The infectious diseases described in the three volumes total 59 kinds. Part of it has been used as a lecture note of pediatric science in National Shanghai Medical College. Therefore, this book can be used as a textbook and as a reference book for practicing physicians. Moreover, the book also includes many photos, all of which were obtained from clinical practice, which will undoubtedly add a lot of value.</p>
<p>In short, this book carefully classifies and lists all infectious diseases in children. It is particularly precise in the area of diagnosis. It can be called a great work of modern pediatrics. It is said that the book has already been published and is sold by the business department of the Wuzhou Pharmacy on Fourth Avenue in this city.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Second Chapter: Engaging in Commerce, Entering the Folk, Returning to Yongshou, Saying Goodbye to Family, Arriving in Chang'an, a Celestial Person Reaches Chang'an</p>
<p>Thus, these three women, in order of age, followed behind. Jia Duocai turned his body to the side and turned his head to ask: "Old lady, do you think Chang'an City is good?" The old woman said: "I've never been there." The girl behind said: "Duh! Chang'an is Xi'an, haven't you been there?" The old woman said: "Oh! You mean this place, it's extremely good, if there is a paradise in the human world, this is paradise, right?" Jia Duocai said: "If you say so, you are very willing to live here after arriving here." The old woman said: "How would I know? My relatives' family is also very poor. I look at it that way, I'm afraid they can't afford to support me." When Li Shilian heard these words, he felt that Jia Duocai's words were leading to the point, so he gently touched his arm. He originally didn't seem to care much about these women. Now that the people on the side could see it somewhat clearly, he was embarrassed to say more, so he remained silent for a while and walked along the road. The old woman suddenly thought of something and asked, "Sir, what is your honorable surname?" Jia Duocai smiled and said, "Why call me sir? I am not an official." Li Shilian interrupted and said, "His surname is Jia, he is from the bank. He has more money than an official." The old woman said, "Yin Bank, Mao Bank, aren't you in the military? Ah! Not a sir, a battalion commander, right?" Li Shilian said, "We all live in Little Western Paradise, if you have anything, you can go there to find us." Jia Duocai said, "Old Li, this is you causing trouble." Li Shilian smiled and said, "What's the big deal? We can help them a little." The old woman said, "Ah! We poor people always depend on the light of you gentlemen." (35)</p>

<p>— Fu Fan</p>
<p>Last year, the Haijing Circus caused a sensation in the city; the month before last, the Hamston Circus also arrived, and it is said that business was also very prosperous. The general public knows that the so-called circus today originated in the West, but before the West introduced circuses to our country, our country originally had something similar to a circus, but the name was different, and the organization was not as complete.</p>
<p>The content of a circus troupe, in addition to the performers showing off some skills, the biggest feature is teaching animals to act. Sometimes, those who travel around selling medicine in our country also play with bears. Isn't this our country's unique small circus troupe? But teaching ferocious beasts like tigers and leopards to act is rarely seen in our country. Training them to do other kinds of actions existed as early as four or five thousand years ago. Although training ferocious beasts to perform other actions is completely different in nature from circus troupes teaching animals to act, the desire to make fierce and stubborn beasts obey human commands is the same. In the Yellow Emperor's era, the Yan Emperor raised troops and fought with the Yellow Emperor on the plains of Banquan. At that time, the Yellow Emperor trained ferocious beasts to fight. The "Records of the Five Emperors" in the "Records of the Grand Historian" says that he taught bears, luo, pixiu, and tigers to fight with the Yan Emperor on the plains of Banquan, which refers to this. Then, the Yellow Emperor, who taught ferocious beasts to fight according to human will, can be said to be the originator of training ferocious beasts in circus troupes.</p>

<p>Two, Section on Noodles and Pastries</p>
<p>Tight Yeast Steamed Buns: Many people say that the tight yeast steamed buns of Nanxiang are famous, but little do they know that the tight yeast steamed buns of Luodian are far superior in practice! The outer skin of Luodian's tight yeast steamed buns is as thin as a very thin wonton wrapper, and it contains a lot of juice. It's best to eat them hot right out of the steamer. They are usually filled with pork, but now that clams and crabs are in season, they are excellent ingredients for filling steamed buns. Moreover, the crabs in the Qingshui River are also superior products. If you ask the shop to make steamed buns filled with shrimp or chicken, it is also very convenient. Of course, the taste will be better than pork filling. Once you have eaten Luodian's tight yeast steamed buns, you will feel that the products of Nanxiang are like a recluse who steals fame purely through pretense, and as for those made by shops around the City God Temple in Shanghai, they are even [beneath mentioning]!</p>
<p>Loose Yeast Steamed Buns: They are still a kind of steamed bun, but loose yeast steamed buns have their own advantages. Loose yeast steamed buns are huge, about the size of a rice bowl. They are as soft as cotton, which is due to the thorough fermentation. Seeing the shape of freshly steamed loose yeast buns, it is easy to think of the breasts of a woman with healthy beauty! Commonly sold, there are large meat fillings and lard filling, of course, there are also a large amount of capacity, but those who truly appreciate loose yeast buns still love the particularly soft dough. If you prepare your own fine filling and give it to the shop to make to order, it will naturally complement each other and be even more delicious! This kind of palatable and easy-to-satiate pastry has the flavor of northern pasta!</p>
<p>Cut Noodles: Long noodles, cut by hand under a knife on a board, I don't know why, the method of the Luodian noodle maker cuts them particularly thin! This is a fundamental advantage, no matter what kind of toppings are used to make soup noodles or fried noodles, they are always superior and welcomed by those who like to eat noodles and are specially mentioned.</p>
<p>Three, Section on Dry Pastries</p>
<p>Lard Chicken Cake: The dry pastries mentioned here are limited to those sold in shops. The lard chicken cake is one of the most famous. Lard pieces are embedded all over the surface, and the chicken eggs are mixed in the noodles in a particularly large amount, creating a fragrant, sweet, fatty, and soft food. It's best to happen to buy it when it's just made, everyone praises it as the ultimate cake, even the various styles of cakes in Western pastries can't catch up with it; however, most of the time you buy it cold, you should still not be afraid of trouble when you bring it back, steam it first when you want to eat it, and it will be no different from the taste when it was just made. Because the size is very inconsistent, the selling price is based on weight rather than the number of pieces.</p>
<p>Honey Cake: The honey cake produced in Luodian's tea shop is much softer than anywhere else! It also has one advantage: it is not as overly sweet as most other places make it, so you can eat a little more. Westerners call the one-month period of a new marriage the "honeymoon." In our country's old customs, honey cakes were used as gifts in wedding ceremonies, also adopting the meaning of [sweet as honey]. I think if people want to use honey cakes in weddings, they should buy Luodian's honey cakes. Then, the relationship between the couple in the future will be as close and sticky as Luodian's honey cake, like glue and lacquer, difficult to separate, which is interesting!</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>She stared blankly at this clear, long river for a long time, seeming to be very engrossed in it.</p>
<p>[Ah! This place is really lovely! It's a pity we forgot something!] Although she looked slightly disappointed, her voice was still very soft. [Wouldn't it be fun if we had brought the yacht?]</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager was very fond of boating. She had two yachts prepared for her use. Whenever she was happy, she would row back and forth on Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace. Unfortunately, these two yachts were really too big and clumsy. It took many eunuchs to row them at the same time, so it felt uninteresting. If they were to be loaded, they would at least have to occupy a flatcar. But I can say with certainty that if the Empress Dowager had known before setting off that there was such a lovely long river here that could be enjoyed, she would not have hesitated to specially arrange a flatcar to bring the yacht along. Even if she had not known in advance, and there was now a very quick way to send someone back to load it immediately, she would not have hesitated to send someone to fetch one at any cost. Unfortunately, there is no such good method now. It takes at least two days to go back and forth from here to Beijing. Could we let the Empress Dowager wait here? Therefore, she did not even think of this idea. She just sighed repeatedly, expressing infinite regret and longing. I couldn't help but ask her privately what she would do if we really brought the yacht. This question excited her very much, like a thirsty person who hears someone mention the taste of tea. She said that she wanted to sit in the yacht with us, while the rest of the people would remain in the carriage. But the carriage had to move very slowly, side by side with the yacht. This way of playing was certainly very novel! She could not only fully enjoy the pleasure of boating, but also admire the newly made set of toys! This yellow train! Slowly rolling on the track. However, she did not consider how much effort it would take for so many people to move the boat and carriage together! (145)</p>

<h3 id="e199">Record of the British National Nude Movement Congress <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent</p>
<p>The nude movement is now being promoted in many countries. Last month, nude movement enthusiasts from various parts of Britain gathered in London to hold their first national congress. Naturally, they held the meeting in secret, so apart from their comrades and a few press representatives, no one knew the location of the gathering, which was in a huge building surrounded by high walls.</p>
<p>Nude movement participants came from as far away as Scotland, and many came in groups from the north and central regions to attend. The opening ceremony was held in a square. All the male and female members, except for six people, were completely naked, lying down or sitting. First, the chairman and secretary gave speeches, and they were also unclothed. The members included men and women of all ages, from elderly people with wrinkled skin to a four-year-old girl. Among them were lawyers, doctors, teachers, and even a nonconformist minister. There was also one Japanese person and one person with one leg.</p>
<p>While the meeting was in progress, suddenly someone saw a ladder leaning against the roof. It turned out that a photographer was trying to secretly take pictures of the meeting. The crowd was immediately alarmed and shouted wildly, "Destroy his film!" "Get him down quickly!" Later, the ladder was taken away, and the crowd allowed the photographer to watch from a window in a high building.</p>
<p>Chairman Schaller said in his opening remarks: "This is the first national congress of the nude movement in Britain, and it is also the first time we have invited the press to participate. We ask the press to take this movement seriously and not to regard it as a fantasy or a joke. The nude movement is suitable for all kinds of people in society and seeks complete equality between men and women of all nations. We are prepared to thoroughly implement this movement." The members then discussed the practical issues of the movement for a long time. The chairman suddenly asked who had a watch to see what time it was. Everyone looked at each other because they had nothing on their bodies at this time, so where would a watch come from? Later, a non-sunbather reported the time to the crowd.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the male and female members walked around the room naked. In the evening, the members organized various games, and a female physical education instructor gave commands to guide everyone in gymnastics, all still completely naked. On the day the male and female members participated in the meeting, after getting up, it didn’t take long for everyone to finish washing up. The men only tidied up their faces, and the women only combed their hair. Neither wore bathrobes nor trousers. The meeting took place in the sunlight all day long. When eating snacks, a cool breeze blew across the square, and several members showed signs of shivering, obviously unable to withstand the cold.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that the British nude movement has become widespread throughout the country, but according to a London correspondent for the Scottish newspaper, the number of southerners joining this movement is gradually increasing. People in the London business and professional circles now often take their families to sunbathing centers on weekends, wearing very light clothing for outdoor recreation and swimming, but the number of people not wearing clothes seems to be increasing daily.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, all groups participating in this movement can strictly observe etiquette, but it is very difficult to persuade ordinary people on the street to join. The only difficulty is that to improve their health, they must be in a place surrounded by high walls and have a membership certificate. There is always an unspeakable mystery about nudism. It is not as good as in the countryside or at the beach, where one can wear a backless swimsuit or other simple clothing, without any restraint, and freely sunbathe or do other exercises. One is less troublesome, and it does not hinder others, but the promoters of the nude movement have a different view.</p>

<h3 id="e200">A Review and Outlook on China's Credit Investigation Industry <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Wenan</p>
<p>I. The Significance of Credit Investigation</p>
<p>The credit investigation industry is an ancillary activity that arises from credit transactions. According to the analysis of general economists, the methods of human transactions can be divided into three periods: (1) the barter period; (2) the monetary transaction period; and (3) the credit transaction period. Today, we have entered the third period, which is that the commercial activities of people in civilized countries cannot be separated from the relationship of credit. What exactly is the meaning of the word "credit"? This can be explained in two layers:</p>
<p>First, from the perspective of commodity relations: Under the current social system, on the one hand, producers add raw materials and labor to produce finished goods; on the other hand, vendors sell the finished goods produced by producers to consumers. According to the principle of transactions, after the vendor obtains the goods from the producer, they should pay the producer the equivalent amount of money, and the transaction is completed. However, since the emergence of the credit system, the situation is different. When the producer sells the goods to the vendor, the vendor must wait until several days or months later before paying the equivalent amount of money to the producer. Then we have to study why the producer is willing to give the vendor a time concession for the money receivable and bear a considerable risk themselves? This is the role of the credit system.</p>
<p>Second, from the perspective of capital relations: On the one hand, the financial industry receives deposits from the social masses and has a large amount of capital; on the other hand, industry and commerce need considerable capital to operate freely. Therefore, the financial industry must find reliable industries and businesses to fully lend out the income funds in order to seek profit; industry and commerce must seek help from the financial industry to obtain capital assistance in order to expand profits. However, most of the funds lent by financial institutions are received from depositors and are responsible for repayment upon maturity or at any time. Therefore, the highest principle of lending funds is safety. Then, what standards does the financial industry use to determine the degree of safety and select its customers? That is the customer's credit. A good degree of credit is safe, otherwise it is not safe. Therefore, credit is of supreme authority in today's society.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the role of the credit system, we can now further study what the credit investigation industry is all about. Simply put, the credit investigation industry is a kind of credit investigation industry in the sale and purchase of commodities and the supply and demand of funds. In detail, before the producer sells the goods on credit to the vendor, they must first assess the latter's creditworthiness. If the creditworthiness is excellent, the credit transaction can be completed, otherwise it will definitely fail. Similarly, before the financial industry lends funds to industry and commerce, it must first assess the latter's creditworthiness to protect the safety of principal and interest. These two types of credit investigation work are the credit investigation industry. We said earlier that the credit investigation industry is an ancillary activity to credit transactions, and that is also what we mean.</p>
<p>II. Historical Review of the Credit Investigation Industry</p>
<p>The agencies that handle credit investigation can be divided into two types: public and private. Public credit investigation agencies specialize in investigating industrial and commercial credit and market news and providing reports as their business. Anyone who wants to lend money or extend credit can consult them about the creditworthiness of their customers. They are generally called credit bureaus. The United Kingdom was the first to establish one, starting in 1830. Subsequently, other countries established them one after another. The United States started in 1840, France in 1857, Germany in 1860, and Japan in the 25th year of Meiji. Up to now, the achievements of the various countries are remarkable, especially the United States and Japan. The two companies in the United States, R.G. Dun and G.C. Bradrtnet, are world-renowned. Their reports on economic and credit conditions are regarded as the standard throughout the country. The Osaka Commercial Credit Bureau and the Tokyo Credit Bureau in Japan are also very well developed. As for private credit investigation agencies, they are the credit investigation departments established by the banks and commercial firms themselves. Their task is to investigate the economic situation and solvency of customers who request financial credit. This type of credit investigation department is now commonly established in larger commercial firms and banks in Europe, America, and Japan. In countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, there is another type of organization, which is a periodic gathering of credit investigation or accounting personnel from the same industry to exchange customer credit information. If a certain business or individual defaults on a payment owed to a certain company in the industry, then the attending member of the company will specifically mention the name of the business owing the debt to alert the industry. In this way, those with poor credit or those who intend to default on debts can be warned, which can invisibly play the role of superior wins and inferior loses, and improve the morality of merchants.</p>
<p>China lags behind in everything, industry and commerce are immature, and the credit system has not been fully utilized, so it is naturally difficult to expect the development of the credit investigation industry. As far as the public credit investigation industry is concerned, in May of the tenth year of the Republic of China, the Second Joint Conference of Banking Associations was held in Tianjin. The Shanghai Banking Association proposed the establishment of a credit bureau, and the Tianjin Banking Association proposed the organization of a domestic and foreign business intelligence investigation office. After discussion, it was decided that each region should establish its own first. As for the member level, the location should not be limited. The Tianjin Banking Association notified the various associations based on the resolution, expressing its advocacy. Although this resolution added some points to the history of China's credit investigation industry, the actual work can be said to be still untouched.</p>
<p>The Chinese are fond of watching and waiting when things happen, lacking the spirit of courage to move forward, and the result is always giving foreigners the opportunity to take the lead. The credit investigation industry is certainly no exception. When the Joint Conference of Banking Associations put the resolution to establish a credit bureau on the shelf, the Americans and Japanese were already doing it in Shanghai. In the past 20 years, foreign-funded credit bureaus have numbered as many as the following five:</p>
<p>Business Trust Bureau</p>
<p>Tokyo Credit Bureau Shanghai Branch</p>
<p>Imperial Credit Bureau Shanghai Branch</p>
<p>Shanghai Credit Bureau</p>
<p>It is a joke that the credit of Chinese people living in this country must be investigated by foreigners from other countries, but in this situation of scarcity, general banks and manufacturers are flocking to them to collect credit information!</p>
<p>In terms of private credit investigation agencies, in the past six or seven years, a small number of banks have established credit investigation departments, such as the Bank of China, Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, and Zhejiang Industrial Bank. However, under the concept of focusing on the street-running system, the investigation departments of various banks are just making do with what is available, and are just a decoration. It is probably far from the truth to want to fully发挥 their functions.</p>
<p>The above is the situation before the 23rd year. After the two incidents of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, on the one hand, because the situation of industry and commerce in Shanghai was getting worse and worse, and the sales of Japanese goods were affected by the boycott and greatly declined, most of the credit bureaus run by Japanese merchants closed down; on the other hand, because the banking industry had a new awareness, it recognized that in order to achieve the sound development of industry, commerce, and finance, it must first seek communication and adjustment between the two parties. Therefore, the China Credit Bureau followed in the footsteps of the Joint Preparatory Committee and was produced, giving the credit investigation industry a bright outlook.</p>
<p>III. Investigation of the Current Situation of the Credit Investigation Industry</p>
<p>The motives of the Shanghai banking industry for establishing a credit bureau can be divided into three points: First, in the past, the credit investigations of various banks, in addition to the information provided by foreign-run credit agencies, also sent their own personnel to investigate and inquire in various ways, based on the most reliable judgment; however, there were often cases where Bank A was investigating a certain commercial firm, and Bank B was also busy inquiring about a certain commercial firm, so the two banks spent a lot of effort, but the result was a duplicate work; now if there is a common agency that concentrates the credit investigation data of the various banks as a whole, when each bank needs to investigate a certain commercial firm, it can first use the existing data as a preliminary reference, and then the agency will conduct a detailed investigation, make a report, and distribute it to the banks that need it, wouldn't it be more effective? Second, after the January 28th Incident, most of the credit bureaus run by the Japanese stopped operating, and the banks lacked sources of information. Third, foreigners' investigations of Chinese credit, at best, only get some superficial knowledge. To know the detailed background, foreigners cannot do it; therefore, even in the past few years, the reports sent by foreigners to the banks have gradually lost their credibility, and they have long had the intention of running their own credit bureaus. With the above three motivations, the China Credit Bureau, run by the Chinese themselves, was produced in June of the 21st year.</p>
<p>The business of the China Credit Bureau is divided into three items: (1) Investigation of credit and business intelligence (2) Directory of Banks and Firms, (3) Debt Collection. Except for the third item, which has not yet been launched, the first two items have been quite effective; domestic and foreign banks and manufacturers have heard the news and joined as members one after another, and even foreign credit investigation agencies have signed contracts with them to exchange information. In addition to establishing a general office in Shanghai, the bureau also has branches and agencies in Hankou and Chongqing. The development of the business can be seen in general.</p>
<p>The establishment of the China Credit Bureau can be regarded as creating a model for China's publicly owed credit agencies, and there is unlimited potential for future development. In terms of private credit investigation agencies, almost all banks in Shanghai have now established special investigation departments or special personnel, striving to contact each other on the exchange of information externally, and striving to integrate with the business internally, each moving forward on the road of supporting the good and eliminating the bad, and distinguishing between surplus and deficit.</p>
<p>IV. Several Prerequisites for Promoting the Credit Investigation Industry</p>
<p>The creation of a new business must have the existence of a congenital environment that nurtures this business, and to achieve long-term progress, it must also have a very suitable situation and give it considerable cultivation. After the January 28th Shanghai War, due to the several reasons mentioned above, the objective conditions for establishing a credit bureau were created, and now the scale is roughly complete. To achieve prosperity and growth, the following prerequisites must also be prepared:</p>
<p>First, social support. Old-fashioned merchants often regard credit bureaus as a kind of detective agency. When they see representatives of credit bureaus, they do not ask right from wrong, and they close their doors and refuse to meet them, avoiding them as if they were a scourge, which has caused great difficulties in terms of collecting information. In all fairness, the purpose of the credit bureau is to give good and excellent people the opportunity to be known to the society as much as possible, and to give the society a warning to be cautious about bad and inferior people; in simple terms, it is to improve business ethics. Since the credit bureau has shouldered this bright purpose and is working hard for the society, then all members of the society naturally have the obligation to be frank and helpful, which goes without saying. Second, system improvement. The reason why the credit investigation industry in Europe, America, and Japan has made rapid progress is of course due to the long history, and the greatest convenience is that the content of the business community is comparatively willing to be public in terms of habits, so that the credit bureau has the opportunity to find out its business figures and accurately determine its surplus and deficit level. We only see that the foreign-owned limited companies have the announcement of the final report after the end of each accounting year. The larger companies must publish the final report in the newspapers; even private enterprises are much more open than in China. Looking back at China's business community, except for banks, there are almost no limited liability organizations that publish their final reports in newspapers, and even single-book business reports are not easily leaked to those who are not closely related. In fact, the essence of a limited liability company should be to publicly disclose its financial status to the outside world, because this can make it convenient for creditors to explore its content and protect their rights and interests. Regarding this point, we hope that the government will urge improvements in the future, so that the credit bureau will not encounter great difficulties in investigating companies.</p>
<p>Moreover, various European and American countries have long implemented income tax and inheritance tax. The properties of groups or individuals are all subject to official investigation, so it is comparatively easy to investigate. However, in China, to investigate a private enterprise or individual, if the enterprise or individual has little association with the outside world, it is extremely difficult to determine the amount of its property; even the lending officers of banks only use a vague estimate of "substantial content" or "average family background" to perfunctorily deal with the customer's background, unlike the credit investigation reports of European and American countries and the credit investigations of banks and commercial firms on their customers, which often have accurate figures listed. It is not difficult to imagine the difficulty in handling affairs and the advantages and disadvantages of the business between these two.</p>
<h3 id="e201">What is the Purpose of Leaving Houses Vacant Rather Than Reducing Rent? <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Bingzhong</p>
<p>The issue of rent reduction in this city has been clamoring for years, and it is still in the process of appealing and petitioning; those who are unfortunate have already been involved in court lawsuits and are paying the full amount. In theory, rent is a contractual act, and once it has been agreed upon, there is only one way to pay according to the contract; if there are special circumstances, the civil law does not necessarily prohibit relief, but it is difficult to say whether it can be established. Therefore, if you want to reduce the rent but not pay the rent, even if you deposit the rent into the bank, it is a breach of contract until you get a rent receipt; judicial officials only know how to enforce the law, and once the landlord sues for arrears of rent, the tenant is rarely not defeated. Others also lack the courage to resolve this matter. Not only is it difficult to set a rent reduction rate, but even if a rate can be set, disputes will inevitably be severe.</p>
<p>Because it cannot meet the wishes of both parties, it is inevitable. Therefore, if we talk about reduction, we will offend the wealthy families and affect donations and receipts; if we do not reduce, we are afraid of resentment from the people. [If you are not crazy or deaf, it is difficult to be a father-in-law.] Rather than being in a dilemma, why not remain silent and ignore it?</p>
<p>Then will the rent reduction issue be resolved without doing anything? This is not something I can know. The most natural solution is when there are no people renting new houses, and fewer people living in old houses, and after a long period of time, the landlord will not be able to avoid reducing the rent even if they want to. Now, this phenomenon does not exist. Although there are many vacant houses, the vacant ones are mostly city houses, and fewer are lane houses; those lane houses that are vacant are mostly Western-style or old, and fewer are Chinese-style. Since there is no fear that there will be no one living in the houses, and the newly built houses rent for as much as 70 yuan per month for a single building up and down, and the houses are rented out as soon as they are not completely completed, it can be seen that there is still a great need for houses, and the rent price is not expensive. Is it not ridiculous for landlords to laugh at the mention of rent reduction at this time? Even if we retreat and seek "pigeon cage style" houses? As for the fee for tenants to take over the house, the rent is cheap, but they still demand a huge amount of takeover fees, which has not decreased, and it is enough to help the landlords maintain the arrogance of the original rent and weaken the voice of rent reduction.</p>
<p>Some say that it is better to reduce the rent than to leave it vacant, and if the rent is reduced, someone will rent it, which is better than leaving it vacant without reducing the rent. This reason is indeed a good calculation for us who rely on others to live in houses. But for those who have property, especially those who operate real estate, it is better to leave it vacant than to reduce the rent. Generally, those who have real estate hope to increase the value of their property and increase their wealth, which is the same psychology. And those who operate real estate are even more eager for the value of real estate to increase, and they can't wait to buy it today, raise the price tomorrow, and sell it the day after tomorrow to make huge profits immediately. But how to make real estate prices rise is naturally created by its environment. Dense population, convenient transportation, and prosperous markets will make real estate expensive. If real estate is expensive, then its rent must be high. Conversely, if the rent is low, then the real estate in the area must be cheap. Since the changes in real estate and rent are directly proportional, the increase or decrease in rent affects the increase or decrease in real estate value, because the rent is originally the interest on real estate investment. Therefore, those who purchase ready-made real estate must calculate the rental income, which is approximately the rate of return on investment before purchasing it. Those who build new houses must also calculate the annual interest rate, and then evenly divide it into the rental cost of the houses. Now, if the rent is reduced, it will reduce the profit they should get, which will also reduce the value of their investment amount. For the sake of maintaining the excellent value of their real estate, those with financial resources have to take the path of preferring to have vacant spaces and refusing to reduce the rent, believing that they will not rent it out unless they charge the rent they want. Those with less financial resources or rents that are too high will offer a kind of disguised rent reduction, that is, those who have lived for a full year will be offered one month's rent for free, but the rent amount has never changed. All of this is because they are unwilling to reduce their rental value, because there is a danger of depreciating the value of their property once the rent is reduced, and there is a fear of making a profit or loss in the accounts. Therefore, they would rather leave it vacant and rather pay legal fees than reduce the rent.</p>
<p>I would like to say a word for those who generally demand rent reduction. If you also open your eyes wide, you should know that many houses on the market now are invested by you and entrusted to others to operate. Why? Because the deposits in bank trusts are the money you have saved from your hard work and blood. Banks collect your deposits and do not use them to develop industrial and commercial industries to recover interests and rights, but use them in the real estate industry to make profits. The towering buildings rise high into the clouds, and the branch offices are lined up like cigarette paper grocery stores. Don't envy them, don't be surprised, they are all built from the flesh and bones of the depositors. Then today's unwillingness to reduce the rent, how can we not say that it is for the sake of guaranteeing the stability and solidity of your deposits, why should you advocate rent reduction and invite self-inflicted harm!</p>
<p>Moreover, if the rent is reduced, the house donation will be less, and if the land price falls, the tax revenue will be insufficient. This is a matter of interests beyond the owners. From this point of view, the general issue of rent reduction involves too much and is difficult to resolve. Moreover, Chinese and foreigners are mixed together, and a unified method may not be able to pass without obstruction. I am afraid that years of struggling and procrastinating are also here.</p>
<p>To solve the problem of living, it is not just a simple rent problem. Low rent is certainly welcomed by tenants, but its benefits are not entirely concentrated on the tenants. There are plenty of opportunities for "second landlords" to profit even if the rent is cheap. There are also cases where the rent is too low, and the landlord is unprofitable, allowing it to collapse without repairing it or building anything, causing the market to suffer as a result, as was the case in Zhabei before the January 28th Incident. Generally, the structure of rent is approximately as follows:</p>
<p>(Land price + building sale + equipment cost) X interest rate = interest</p>
<p>Rent + interest + donations and taxes = ?</p>
<p>The high price of rent is promoted by the land valuation being increased each time. High land prices mean high costs, which makes rent expensive. However, the increase in land prices is what both the public and private sectors want. What techniques can be used to limit it? There is no other way but to implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's method of equalizing land rights, using the excess profits for public use, so that those who manipulate land prices have nothing to covet, and land prices can be returned to a flat standard, and rent can be expected to stabilize. The second is to start organizing housing construction cooperatives, and at the same time finance funds to realize it, but this is not something that can be done by those with small assets, nor can it be done by the general public. Even if funds are financed, the debt will be high when the houses are completed with high interest loans of more than 10%. The other is to hope that more affordable housing will be built for the use of general salaried workers, which is also slim. The current affordable housing is mostly intended for those living in grass huts, and it is not even possible to [leave the dark valley and move to the tall trees,] let alone the rest!</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Trend of Vacant Houses in Shanghai <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Dehui</p>
<p>Shanghai's population has surged from 75,000 eighty years ago to 3,360,000 today. In the near future, the trend of population increase is unlikely to stop here, which no one can deny. Because of the population increase, the need for housing will naturally increase! And the demand for land will also increase in value due to the increase in housing construction. Whether a city expands depends on the accurate results of population growth and decline. The relationship between housing construction, population expansion, and rising land prices is inherently linked. In such a situation of constant change in Shanghai, the living conditions are worth understanding. Moreover, the recent rent reduction movement is also based on residential issues!</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the types of housing construction are divided according to needs: warehouses, city houses, apartments, offices, Chinese-style residences, and Western-style residences. Except for warehouses, apartments, and offices, the residential aspects are Chinese and Western-style residences. The status of Shanghai's housing situation in the past 33 years can be accurately assessed from housing rentals. The following table refers to the public concession area, but the public concession area can be seen as a microcosm of the entire Shanghai.</p>
<p>Rented Houses Unrented Houses</p>
<p>Year Chinese Western Year Chinese Western</p>
<p>1901 32.  1.4  1918 3.2 2.8</p>
<p>1902 2.8 3.4  1919 2.2 2.0</p>
<p>1903 2.0 7.0  1920 0.8 2.3</p>
<p>1904 1.9 8.1  1921 0.6 2.5</p>
<p>1905 2.2 6.2  1923 1.2 3.2</p>
<p>1906 2.4 3.4  1923 1.8 4.2</p>
<p>1907 5.1 6.1  1924 1.9 6.6</p>
<p>1908 7.2 10.9 1925 3.5 10.0</p>
<p>1909 7.9 14.6 1926 2.9 8.2</p>
<p>1910 8.1 14.8 1927 4.1 6.4</p>
<p>1911 5.0 6.8  1928 5.6</p>
<p>1912 2.3 4.7  1929 1.7 6.8</p>
<p>1913 1.2 3.3  1930 8.9</p>
<p>1914 2.1 6.8  1931 2.21 1.0</p>
<p>1915 3.2 7.1  1932 4.0 12.6</p>
<p>1916 3.7 4.8  1933 4.4 2.8</p>
<p>1917 3.1 3.7  1934 5.3 14.0</p>
<p>(Note) The fourth quarter of each year is taken as the standard. 1934 is the first quarter.</p>
<p>In the above table, the vacancy rate for Western-style houses was the lowest in 1901, only 1.4%, and the highest in 1910, at 14.8%. This was because it coincided with the stock market frenzy, resulting in so many vacant houses. Last year, 1933, the vacancy rate reached 12.8%, and in the first quarter of this year, it was 14.0%, setting a high record since 1910. As for Chinese-style residences, the vacancy rate is lower than that of Western-style residences, as clearly indicated in the table. This is because the population in the public concession is mainly Chinese. Over the years, the domestic situation has been unstable, with natural disasters and man-made calamities, and the devastation by communist bandits. Generally, the slightly wealthy class considers the concession to be a safe haven, so they have all come to live in the concession. Because of this, the vacancy rate in the last three years has only accounted for four-sixths, which is 8/6 less than the vacancy rate of Western-style residences! At the same time, it is difficult to find stylish and beautiful Chinese-style residences, so people generally have to rent Western-style residences, which has been increasing year by year. In 1905, the rate of Chinese people living in Western-style residences was 10.3%, 12.3% in 1910, 18.5% in 1915, 21.5% in 1910, 22.2% in 1925, 34.7% in 1930, and it had reached 40.5% in 1932, showing the current trend of Chinese people living in Western-style houses. As mentioned above, the vacancy rate of Chinese-style residences is lower than that of Western-style residences due to the increase in the number of Chinese people in the concession. In 1905, there were 45,328 Chinese-style residences, housing a population of 452,816 people. By 1930, there were 77,907 residences, housing a population of 971,397 people. In the past 25 years, the population has clearly increased by more than half, while the number of residences has not even doubled. Therefore, the overcrowding of residences is inevitable. In Shanghai, an average of six families live in one city house, including the front and back buildings, front and back living rooms, attic, and kitchen. Therefore, living in Shanghai is truly like living in a pigeon coop. Comfort is out of the question, and hygiene is never mentioned. How distressing this is! Although living in pigeon coop-style houses, the price is only affordable for people with middle-class income, so they have to shrink their living space. This is why vacant houses are becoming increasingly common, and many bustling places are also empty. This is not because of a decrease in population, but because the heavy burden of rent has led to austerity measures. I hope that landlords in general would find it more beneficial to reduce rents than to leave houses vacant.</p>

<p>丨Declines Ranged from 35 Jiao to 1 Yuan丨</p>
<p>Last week, from October 1st to 6th, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange experienced relatively slight fluctuations. Rumors rose and fell from time to time, and the bond market fluctuated, making it difficult to remain calm for the time being. There are many waves ahead, and market price fluctuations will inevitably be erratic. It is difficult to be optimistic about the overall trend for the time being. Last week, there were rumors in the southwest on Monday, causing a unified drop of 23 jiao to 8 jiao. On Tuesday, the rampage of bandits in Fujian caused another drop of half a yuan. On Wednesday, some improvements in the Four-Power Constitution prompted retail investors to buy in, recovering half a yuan. On Saturday, rumors suddenly arose, causing a small drop of several jiao to more than one yuan. Saturday continued to be sluggish, as the situation was uncertain and many people were skeptical. The downward trend was relatively stable. In total, the results for the week showed a drop ranging from 35 jiao to 1 yuan. The total number of transactions was 8,500, listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Stagnant and Unexciting</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 6th), the New York stock market was sluggish, with slight differences in prices. Silver stocks were very strong. According to the report, the US government will continue to purchase silver abroad until the ratio of silver to gold reaches 1:3. This indicates that US silver will continue to have a good market. It is also rumored that the Treasury Department will raise domestic silver prices. The shares of California have made progress due to the change of opinion of speculators on Sinclair's election as governor. Most of those who gamble on winning or losing still expect Sinclair to be elected, but Wall Street has doubts about whether he can implement his proposals.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices were mixed due to waiting for the government report. They were firm at first due to good news from Liverpool, but then softened due to foreign merchants selling. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 1 to 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 34 points. Indian cotton was firm due to speculation and purchases by European exporters. The average price rose by 1.5 rupees, the average price of fine cloth rose by 7.5 jiao, and the average price of white cloth rose by half a rupee.

<p>Prediction of American Cotton Government Report</p>

<p>American Cotton Estimated to Have a Bountiful Harvest</p>
<p>New York, 15th. A report on the cotton market for the week states that the cotton market this week has been quite volatile, as many parties continue to close out positions, and retail investors in the South and speculators are also selling. However, when prices fall, there is some short covering and buying by the industry. The weakness of the wheat market and the fluctuations in the exchange rate are the reasons for the disturbance in the cotton market. Furthermore, private cotton production estimates have raised expectations of a bountiful cotton harvest. It is heard that the underlying prices in the South remain firm, but this news and the report of an increase in the amount of new cotton pledged at 1.2 jiao loans have failed to stimulate buying interest and have only shaken the confidence of the old bulls. In terms of effectiveness, the 1.2 jiao loan currently has the power to maintain market prices. The manager of the Producer's Cooperative Sales Agency claims that, comparatively speaking, the bids obtained by the agency are very few that are acceptable, and there is no need to sell much now. More sales must wait until prices are slightly higher, and holders of licensed cotton can sell more when they hand over their licenses to the agency. At the same time, the cotton market is on a firm footing, and many people believe that the amount of sales will inevitably decrease, as cotton farmers have more support from government loans, and more are holding back from selling cotton than before.</p>

Initially, the rice mill district was active, but later, because the stomach bags happened to be on a Sunday and did not take action, people's hearts suddenly turned cold, and the situation suddenly became stagnant and softened. Newly arrived goods such as white rice are relatively scarce, and market prices have not yet experienced gains or losses. New Du Yang rice, however, is quite suitable for shopkeepers' stomachs and is also in short supply, so the situation is very strong, and the price alone can stand out and rise significantly. Various broken rice varieties are generally stable, and the path for changing yuan is not wide, continuing the downward trend. There is not much difference in new Yin yuan.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 boats arrived at the river. The market demand for various types was flat. The price of Gao Xi new japonica rice was short by one jiao, and the price of medium-grade rice was short by two jiao. The price of northern gang white broken was short by about one jiao. The arrival of change yuan was still heavy, the demand was slightly sluggish, and the price was again short by nearly one jiao. The prices of rice and new American long rice are limited, and the sales market is active, so the prices are sufficient. The price of Dongxin japonica rice is short and there is no demand.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Interest <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Ruomu</p>
<p>All people should have a sense of interest.</p>
<p>So-called interest, in itself, has good and bad distinctions.</p>
<p>Usually, [interest] and [hobby] cannot be confused. The so-called [hobby] belongs to a kind of entertainment, while [interest] is the human [satisfaction of desire] requirement.</p>
<p>Like [labor]! This is a worthwhile painful thing, but some people are engaged in such heavy work, or even regardless of their own lives, and desperately laboring. It is not right to say that they are particularly able to endure hardship. It is because their expectations for harvest are too exciting and too enthusiastic, so they will unconsciously forget the pain.</p>
<p>Although interest does not appear in every occasion that can adapt to human requirements? At the same time, will it always exist because human desires continue to be latent? This is completely denied by general artists. They think that interest is only something that exists temporarily.</p>
<p>How important is the education of interest to life? This fact, like the French master Millet in his The Angelus, can give us a little hint of understanding this problem. In his room, it is painted like this: the evening clouds are dyed golden, and the bells of Ave Maria are ringing. In the distant jungle, the high towers of the temple rise. And in another corner there are two farmers! They are a couple, 丨 are finishing their day's work and embarking on their way home. At this time, when they heard the bell from afar, they lowered their heads, facing each other, and silently prayed to the God of love. [This is a famous painting full of great meaning. At the same time, it is also full of great truths showing [interest]!</p>
<h3 id="e209">In Contradiction <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Er</p>
<p>Living in modern society, one often thinks in a certain way, but ends up doing the opposite. The so-called theory and practice become spear and shield. For example, knowing hypocrisy is wrong, one wants to be honest and without pretense, but this often makes it difficult to survive. So, one is forced to resort to hypocrisy. Is this just an individual's fault? It's not that simple. It's the restriction of a contradictory social life that forces individuals to follow society and live in contradiction.</p>
<p>To be honest, we think that women wearing high heels turns them into mere vases and toys, which is not right. But often, seeing a woman in high heels, the beauty of her curves is especially appealing, and one feels it wouldn't be bad to hold and play with her. Even women themselves often feel that wearing high heels is indeed not good for their health, and it's intended to make them a toy for men. But in the end, they go against what they think, cater to social customs, and have to wear high heels to avoid suffering losses in society. Many women wear high heels without realizing this, but how many female students knowingly commit this offense? In particular, there are many women and men who speak out against women being treated as toys, yet they themselves, or their wives, still wear high heels. Isn't this obvious? Why such a contradiction?</p>
<p>Perhaps many people will say that this is because their understanding and will are not thorough, so they cannot put their theories into practice. This is also a reason, but to consider this the complete solution is problematic.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it is the restriction of the entire social life that leads to contradiction because of the contradictions inherent within it. Therefore, no matter how strong your will, it will largely be restricted by this fundamental constraint, preventing you from transcending this contradictory life.</p>
<p>Does this mean we should just let it go and live in contradiction? Not necessarily. We believe that the cause lies in the contradiction of the entire social life. Therefore, although relying solely on individual will to oppose it has little effect, one must consider this entire contradiction. So, to put it bluntly, the fact that most people live contradictory lives requires a joint effort to fundamentally resolve the contradictions of the entire social life, in order to completely eliminate being trapped in contradiction.</p>
<p>Especially the petit bourgeoisie, are full of contradictions. They understand that the class that dominates society is contradictory, but they often have to rely on it to survive, making it difficult to break away completely and go to the opposite, hostile side of this dominant force to eliminate the contradictions of the rulers. Therefore, they often hover in the middle, living a contradictory life.</p>
<p>If one cannot break away from the entire contradictory social life, even if one's individual will is strong, trying to eliminate the contradiction within oneself will likely be in vain. Only by fundamentally breaking away from the original contradictory life, climbing towards a new direction, and waiting until the contradictions of the entire social life are eliminated, can people generally escape living in contradiction!</p>
<h3 id="e210">There are Exceptions <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>Some say that this year marks the end of the intellectual class, and the reality is indeed very serious. First, there was the job-seeking movement of graduates from various universities in Peiping, followed by the response from graduates of National Central University in Nanjing and Great China University in Shanghai, causing a huge commotion. This has sparked comments from all sides, with some saying it is due to the flaws of the absolute social system, and others saying the graduates themselves are unsound and have excessively high desires. Both arguments naturally have their reasons, especially the former being more powerful, without a doubt. However, there are exceptions.</p>
<p>This past Wednesday, a friend, Mr. X, specifically came to see me to ask me to find an agriculture teacher for him. He said he had been looking for a whole week and hadn't found one, knowing that I had some connections with XX Agricultural School, so he came to me for help. I agreed to help him find one, as I knew several friends in that field and had some connections with XX Agricultural School, so I was confident that I could find someone. But the reality turned out to be quite different. It has been a full four days now, and I still haven't found a solution, so I have to tell him to seek help from someone more capable.</p>
<p>Secondly, I personally heard someone mention that graduates of various universities feel they have no way out, but there are exceptions in two schools. One is XX National University in this city, where graduates of a certain banking department were all reserved by banks, and they even asked the school authorities if there were any more. The other is XX National University in Peiping, where graduates of a certain economics department were also all reserved, and they had jobs as soon as they left school, without even the word "unemployment" being mentioned, let alone time to rest.</p>
<p>These are absolute facts, one that I experienced myself, and one that others experienced. From these facts, it can be clearly seen that young people are not completely without a way out, but they themselves must be quite sound. Young people from general "wild chicken" schools will naturally have to frown. Secondly, the Chinese education system does indeed need some reorganization. The prosperity of liberal arts and the crowding of friends who wield pens naturally pose a problem for finding a way out. We are an agricultural country and urgently need to catch up with the industrial process. In fact, we desperately need such talents.</p>

<p>— Xi Zhen</p>
<p>It hasn't been long since the Mid-Autumn Festival. In the village, on the streets, a sparse drizzle falls; the weather turns</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>sultry again. The villagers all sigh idly, looking at the withered rice stalks in the fields. Children over the age of six take small iron shovels at night to steal sweet potatoes from the gardens of wealthy households, bringing them back to make tomorrow's meal. Adults make bamboo baskets and spin cotton thread at home, preparing to sell them on the streets for a few coins to survive the winter. Those with acquaintances in the city run around the streets all day, saying, "You always say you're better off than us. There's famine in the countryside, but surely things aren't that bad in the city. Please help us out."</p>
<p>"Don't say that. City people have their own hardships. You can imagine what the situation is like at this time of year. No one is doing well."</p>
<p>Everyone frowns; there's nothing they can do!</p>
<p>The rain falls unintentionally, and people have no urgent hope at all. It's already August; what hope is there in rain? "Heaven is forcing people to become robbers; there's nothing we can do!"</p>
<p>After a desolate Mid-Autumn Festival (this year, the only incense and candle shop in the town sold only two incense holders in this village of over two hundred households. One was from Master Wang's house at the head of the village, and the other was from the school of Teacher Li), the market after the festival became even more desolate. Five shops in the town closed, one of which was a rice shop: rice rose to eleven yuan and eight jiao, and even middle-class families stopped eating rice. During the three months of drought, only eight shi of rice were sold. Another was the "Jing Guang Sundries" shop owned by Third Uncle's elder brother, Second Son, which started with eighty yuan of capital. People gradually can't even afford sweet potatoes. Some go to the Southern Goods store to buy pearl rice, and others eat rice bran used to feed chickens by wealthy families (which is hard to get; many people wait to grab it every day).</p>
<p>Second Son's family went to Shanghai to work (naturally, they secretly took some of the shop's goods with them). Third Uncle wanted to call A-Hu to go with them, but Second Son and his family refused, saying repeatedly, "We're family, can't you even do this for us? This child can do something. He definitely won't be a burden to you in Shanghai. Let him pull a rickshaw or be a beggar."</p>
<p>Seeing this, A-Hu also left.</p>
<p>Leaving Third Uncle alone, eating four sweet potatoes a day, cursing heaven, cursing the times, cursing fate, cursing the age of fifty-nine, cursing this and that.</p>
<p>That day was the nineteenth. The moon was still very good at dusk, and it was cold enough. The wind brought a bit of a sharp taste. (However, during the day, some people still took their tattered cotton-padded coats and trousers to the pawnshop to ask for three or four hundred coins.) When it got dark, Third Uncle had just gone to bed (at this time of year, no one lit lamps). Shen Fu from Master Wang's house knocked on the door urgently: "Third Uncle, the master wants you to come over."</p>
<p>Trembling, "Brother Shen Fu, come inside and sit. Is it about the field this year? The master went to the countryside to check the rent the other day and saw everything. The famine isn't our fault..."</p>
<p>"No, our whole family is moving to our aunt's house in Shanghai tomorrow. We're so busy tonight that everyone is dizzy. He wants you to come immediately to help move things, and also—"</p>
<p>Also, Master Wang, because Third Uncle was an "old tenant of three generations" and also a single man, clean and tidy, wanted him to watch the empty house.</p>
<p>Under the dim yellow light of the large safe lamp, weary faces were revealed, the master, the mistress, the concubine, and the young master who wore foreign clothes and studied at a university in Shanghai. Everyone had a heart filled with escape. "Get things done early, and leave early tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>Looking at this situation, Third Uncle's heart felt like it was sinking into an ice cave. Such a large family was saying that one day it would collapse. Like attending a funeral, countless indescribable hands were grabbing at his heart.</p>
<p>At night, the moon was good, and Third Uncle slept in Shen Fu's room. "The countryside is finally finished," Shen Fu told him. The eldest young master had asked someone in Shanghai to find him a teaching job, with more than twenty yuan a month. The master still had a hundred or so silver dollars on hand. They said that they would always find a way to survive in Shanghai, at least for a year. "If not, they could even buy lottery tickets."</p>
<p>Shen Fu climbed into bed, turned over, and began to snore. Third Uncle couldn't sleep, his eyes open, watching the moonlight on the ground. There were too many questions contained in his mind. But suddenly, as if he had received some revelation, he thought, "The countryside is definitely finished, but going to Shanghai is at most buying lottery tickets."</p>
<p>With that, he turned over and thought of A-Hu, wandering in the big city.</p>
<p>The night was deathly silent.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Autumn Night <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Tu</p>
<p>The autumn wind gently caresses the locust trees by the shore, the leaves whispering softly. The autumn night moon appears especially clear and bright. Although the night is already deep, Yong and I are still wandering by the shore.</p>
<p>The midnight tide is gradually swelling. The waves strike the rocks on the shore, sending up dazzling sprays, emitting a tantalizing sound. Moonlight illuminates the sea, shimmering with silver ripples. The distant, bobbing fishing boats, with their isolated lamps, look like the flickering of will-o'-the-wisps. The seaside of the South is beautiful after all! Especially in this late autumn night.</p>
<p>Silence, silence, all the scenery is silent under the moonlight. Only the sound of the tide and leaves play the nocturne of autumn sorrow in rhythm.</p>
<p>"Ming, look, how beautiful the moon is tonight!"</p>
<p>Yong, who had been silent for a long time, finally opened his kind smile, pointing to the moon that had already hung high in the sky. Unconsciously, a happy smile appeared on his face. He seemed to have forgotten the tangles in his heart. He stood up and took my hand.</p>
<p>"What for? You're so excited?"</p>
<p>"What are you dazing about? Only tonight, let's talk excitedly!"</p>
<p>With just one sentence, I fell silent again. Although there were many words I wanted to say in my heart, they were all stuck in my throat. His excitement made me even more silent.</p>
<p>The autumn night breeze blew into my thin underwear, and I felt a chill. But we were still wandering by the shore, as if the slight autumn wind was blowing into my lonely heart like strands of sorrow. Lowering my head, I looked at our two thin, long shadows, feeling only the sadness of life's journey, like these shadows being trampled by people's feet.</p>
<p>"Ming, don't dream anymore. Tomorrow, I have to leave this place. You know, my family environment won't allow me to stay any longer. A happy life, I'm afraid, won't exist for me anymore. However, I think this departure, one day, we will meet again."</p>
<p>"I also think so, we will meet again."</p>
<p>Moonlight shone on Yong's thin, yellow, pale face. The wind stirred his disheveled hair. The smile that had been so excited on his face gradually faded. His pair of beautiful black eyes stared unblinking at the boundless distance of the sea, silently contemplating.</p>
<p>Night, autumn night, sorrows endlessly as long as silkworm threads, entangling my deep heart. Yong and I finally wandered the entire night by this sea, staggering.</p>
<p>The morning can make people excited. The autumn sun can make people love. On this very morning, Yong, holding a desolate heart, left his old hometown, embarked on a journey, and drifted toward the equator across the vast sea.</p>
<p>A year goes by easily, and it's autumn again. After a year, I finally received news about Yong, and it was unfortunate news! He, my dear friend Yong, lost consciousness three months after arriving on the other side and departed from the world forever.</p>
<p>A young man, a promising young man, finally lost his life in the barrel of the sub-society, under the whip of life.</p>
<p>Autumn, what a sorrowful autumn! Whenever the moon shines in front of the window in the deep night, I can only look at the clear moon, the azure sky, and deeply recall those sorrowful past events.</p>
<h3 id="e214">One of the Curse of Autumn 1934 <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaolin</p>
<p>People all say that Shanghai is heaven on earth, with gold and silver everywhere. Therefore, Shanghai is worth praising and visiting. If you don't believe it, look at the skyscrapers that reach into the clouds, increasing and being built day by day, and the countless dance halls and taverns that continue to appear. With these money-burning places, isn't Shanghai a world of gold?</p>
<p>Is Shanghai really worth praising? Yet most people are praising it. So from inland cities and villages, hundreds and thousands of people leave their homes and cross mountains and seas to rush to this paradise of Shanghai every day. They bring with them a joyful heart, hoping to pick up gold. As for whether it is easier to find food in Shanghai, that is true. If it's a big place, with so many factories, it shouldn't be difficult to find a bite to eat. But there is more than just one or two people looking for food to eat. Instead, there are countless people opening their mouths and waiting.</p>
<p>Few actually find food to eat. The joy and beautiful hope that filled their hearts before arriving in Shanghai are immediately shattered as soon as they set foot on this land.</p>
<p>Is Shanghai worthy of praise? You have to live there to know. And after living there for a while, you're sure to ask what is there to praise in Shanghai, and instead curse it. But cursing is futile. The stomach cannot be empty all the time; you need to eat. But food is not easily obtained. Having already arrived, there is no work to do, and there is no way to go back. So they become vagrants. Vagrancy, or even turning to crime, makes the world uneasy day by day.</p>
<p>Yes, on the other hand, Shanghai is worthy of praise, with songs, strings, and music, a drunken paradise of gold. But this is, after all, another world, one that has nothing to do with them. Their world is darkness, hunger, disease, and death. So Shanghai is to be cursed. Who says no?</p>

<h3 id="e215">Arrived in Tokyo <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>After arriving in Tokyo, I once sent you a postcard. I left Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru at 9:00 AM on June 19th and arrived in Tokyo at 7:20 AM on the 22nd. During these three days and three nights, because I was seasick for two days and two nights and didn't sleep a wink on the train, my body was as exhausted as if I had just recovered from a serious illness, and I couldn't move.</p>
<p>On this trip to Japan, I was accompanied by two classmates named Tang, and we are now living together in the Chinese Dormitory at No. 31, Oiwake-cho, Hongo-ku, Tokyo.</p>
<p>Japanese cuisine is indeed something we cannot eat; and Japanese-style Chinese food (so-called "China cuisine") is also very difficult to swallow.</p>
<p>Although I have arrived in Japan, I don't speak much Japanese, and I often end up tongue-tied and at a loss when dealing with maids. I have now entered the Tokyo Japanese Language School and rush to school, which is six or seven li away, at 8:00 AM every day for classes. For the sake of money, we don't take the train (in Tokyo, there are so many trains that the tracks on the ground are as dense as a spider web, and there are also buses and underground trains, and they are now rushing to build underground train tracks; these underground trains and trains are said to be for the purpose of preventing World War). Therefore, we have a mandatory course of walking eighty minutes every day.</p>
<p>In Japan, the relationship between men and women is nonchalant. On the second night after I first arrived in Japan, a friend named Zhang, who had been living in Japan for more than a year, took me to a Japanese bathhouse. It really surprised me; the Japanese male and female bathhouses are placed in the same room, and their boundary is only a short wall as high as the body. If I were half a head taller, standing at the base of the wall, I could see the movements on the other side. At one end of the short wall, there is a high counter and a small wooden door. Sitting at the counter are young, well-dressed female shopkeepers, and young maids are running back and forth to take care of the dozens of naked men without any hesitation or familiarity. They don't seem to feel any surprise about naked men, because I saw them facing naked men without the slightest shyness. The small door is half-closed, and the maids run back and forth through this door, taking care of both sides. Through the crack in this door, we can see the girls who have finished bathing putting on their pants or tying the small bundles on their backs. The wall is too low, and the sound of water and the sweet voices in the women's bathhouse can be heard very clearly in our ears.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tang brothers and I went to [Ueno Park]. In the park, there is a large Western-style building that is the venue for the National Defense Exposition. In front of the entrance to the exposition, there is a large archway that was recently built to commemorate the birth of the Japanese Crown Prince. On this archway, the plaque of [The First Pass Under Heaven] from Shanhaiguan in our country is prominently displayed! Opposite this archway, there is a stone monument commemorating the soldiers who died in the Taiwan Expedition. Around this stone monument, there are Chinese cannons obtained in this battle. (These cannons are erected on the ground and are two and a half feet high. Iron rings are installed on both sides of the cannonballs and connected with iron chains, acting as the iron railings for this stone monument.) To the left of this stone monument, a large iron anchor obtained in this battle is erected there, with a height one and a half times my own. After leaving Ueno Park, the three of us spent 45 sen (worth a little less than 4 jiao 5 fen in Chinese currency) to visit the zoo: this zoo is very grand, as big as twenty animal parks in Shanghai Confucian Temple Park.</p>
<p>Japanese literature books are unexpectedly cheap: a 38-volume [World Literature Collection] in a one-inch-thick, cloth-bound hardcover edition only sells for 10 yen. You have read Japanese, so if you want to buy it, I can buy it for you. I have already written quite a bit. Goodbye! I hope you will write to me often.</p>
<h3 id="e216">A Small Memory <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Lie</p>
<p>There was a time when I loved to eat peanuts, almost every day, and I ate a lot of them. So much so that sometimes when I had guests, I considered peanuts to be the best delicacy. Although my friends didn't reject them, most of them showed some strangeness, looking somewhat inexplicable.</p>
<p>But this was my habit three years ago; it's a thing of the past. Now, when I see peanuts, I can't help but feel a bitter taste in my mouth. Speaking of this, I can't help but feel slightly sentimental. First, the short three years of my life have made me less interested in things. Rolling around in society, not only has the habit of eating peanuts disappeared, but many other loves have also been cut off one after another. Now, the only thing I still love is smoking. This is because I am too burdened by life, and I am busy all day long, so I naturally have no leisure. This is something we young people often lament! Secondly, because this habit of eating peanuts has faded, I feel even more lonely in life. This is not just a simple matter of taste.</p>
<p>Speaking of it, the habit of eating peanuts was not inevitable, but accidental. In my hometown, even later when I was studying in the city of C Province, I had never seen peanuts. All there were were groundnuts, and I got a headache just looking at them, let alone eating them.</p>
<p>After I came to Shanghai, during a certain summer, I started eating peanuts. After a period of time, I grew to love them more and more, and so it became my only habit at the time.</p>
<p>My roommate, seeing the sudden growth of this habit, always showed a surprised expression to me. No, he once asserted that [my habit was infected by someone else]. Although I politely explained that it wasn't, he still didn't quite believe it, so I let him laugh.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, there was indeed such an incident. C, a classmate, because of various coincidences, had always shown goodwill to me. But speaking of it, it was just goodwill, nothing else. Even going for a walk outside the school with her or going to the cinema to see a movie would cause people to gossip and be uneasy all day long. It was an environment where jealousy was at its worst. Coincidentally, she also loved to eat peanuts. Although she didn't eat as much as I did, she probably loved them even more.</p>
<p>One day, there was a sudden change, and everyone scattered. It has been several years since I heard any news about her. Yesterday, Mr. W suddenly mentioned her, saying that she had not only become someone's wife, but also a mother. And after these years of social hardship, I no longer have the habit of eating peanuts, which does make people feel…</p>

<p>Lifelong upright and honest. Song Dynasty famous minister Fan Zhongyan. Newly appointed Kaifeng as governor. He secretly visits the people in disguise. Who can recognize him as a disguised traveler? He strolls leisurely into the tea house. Holding fragrant tea. Pouring clear spring water. Suddenly sees the master and servant walking in. The tea shop owner greets them bowing, calling them members of the gentry repeatedly. They disagree in several words and act impolitely. Before leaving, they utter malicious words. Upon detailed inquiry, it is learned that Zhang Min is evil. His illegal and overbearing ways are all due to his wealth and power. His family servant helps him in his wickedness, named Zhang Qian. Let's talk about Zhou Yu's case in the past. He loved beauty and cheated people, taking lives. He filled twenty ingots of silver with two ingots. He harmed the scholar and exiled him. At the separation from the court, tears streamed down. Wife separated from children for more than ten years. After investigating and clarifying the evil deeds, he returns to the yamen. He immediately judges with the vermilion brush in the court. Zhang Min's crime is too serious to be forgiven. He hangs a high mirror that reflects without bias. The people admire and praise him again and again.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter: Sister Flowers</p>
<p>The women of Spring River are the most open-minded, they are willing to put in effort with their glamorous attire, powdery white and rouge red, sister flowers, three parts true color and seven parts effort. They are regular patrons of dance halls and cinemas, social flowers emerge from Shanghai East. One is a middle-aged woman, still charming, still worthy of attracting butterflies and bees. One is in her youthful years, naturally charming, not losing the same paired branch flavor, a pair of delicate figures, both healthy and beautiful, slender figures with delicate voices. The new style of hair is permed in spirals, with snow-white skin and jade-like complexion. Willow-leaf eyebrows are pleasing to everyone, cherry-like mouths are dyed crimson. Before the slight cold has passed, they expose their arms first, and as early summer arrives, they bare their chests early. One loves to wear apple green, and one likes to often wear light and dark red. Gauzy silk, hides the double peaks, light steps are wonderfully infinite, round and snowy legs are naturally beautiful, leather shoes with镂花 are like a smooth road. One is that in the Yi Garden, she encounters a young man, a strange fate met on the road, with pledges of love and oaths of eternal alliance, sweet and loving, two hearts as one. One is a chance encounter with a young master from the countryside, seeing him is very fulfilled, feigning affection and diligently offering love, playing with the soul of the villager in the palm of her hand, temporarily borrowing a room to make good times, a thousand gold for a moment in the melting moonlight, completely unaware that form is emptiness and emptiness is form, this body is simply being a moth drawn to a flame, body and soul ruined by desire, extreme joy leads to sorrow and sending off the end, unexpectedly advancing towards the city of unjust death.</p>
