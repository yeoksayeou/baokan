<h3 id="c17">華北通車通郵問題恒 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>自華北發生通車通郵問題。中央卽屢聲明並無此項談判。迨近日於南昌會議之際。忽又盛傳日方以重大壓力迫我解决通車通郵問題之說。於是關心時局之國人。遂對於汪行政院長之赴贛返京。黃政委會長之離贛來滬。均起多大之注意。而於黃之會晤有吉日使。更格外加以重視。但考。之報載。自汪院長返京後。卽對問者堅决否認其事。並據某要人談話。亦否認商談通車通郵問題。而黃委會長抵滬後。對記者報吿華北情形。謂日本在最近。事實上并無重大要求提出。惟零碎要求甚多耳。夫通車通郵問題。以吾人觀察。關係重大。當然不能視爲零碎要求。則黃委長之所謂零碎要求。决非指此問題可知。迨黃與有吉會晤後。有吉對日記者談話。亦謂中國對通車通郵問題等之實行解决。須經十二分之考慮。觀此種種則可知今日外間所傳通車通郵問題如何急進如何解决者。皆神經過敏之談。或片面過放之空氣也。　　夫中央所以必欲加以十二分之鄭重考慮者。豈無故歟。蓋此通車通郵問題。表面上雖若一部分之事。而實際則爲東北主權問題所繫。由國際公法言。一國對於一新國進行商業上經濟上之談判。且與之締約者。卽爲對於此一新國。作事實上之承認。設己國之主權不及於此一國。而與他國談判或締結關於此一國之條約。則在事實上他國卽爲此一國之宗主國。今日華北與僞國之通車通郵問題。不與對方談判解决則已。苟與談判。無論對方爲僞國或爲日本。事實上皆足搆成吾國放棄東北主權之嫌。設其對方爲僞國。一與交涉。卽不啻承認其有獨立之資格。設其對方爲日本。亦卽不啻承認僞國爲日本之保護國。兩者實無一而可也。</p>
<p>且僞國之不容承認。與日本手造傀儡之非法。非特爲我國人一致之心理。卽在國聯。亦早有歷次决議之表示。自日本决定退出國聯後。國聯深恐有二國家。爲日本所勾結。進行單獨承認僞國之舉。故特於去年六月七日。通過不承認僞國之切實辦法。特别規定「各會員國之行爲。足以被視爲明認或默認僞國政府者。應避免之。」則吾國當然應首先避免此破壞决議之嫌。更無待言。</p>
<p>不僅此也。假使不幸爲日本强力所迫而與之解决。則其結果。必將使九國公約非戰公約所賦予中國之權利。盡皆喪失。蓋吾國領土主權之完整。爲九國公約所規定。而以武力造成之局面。又爲非戰公約所嚴斥。自九一八以來。此等條約。雖皆未能發生實效。然列强所以不致明目張膽步武日本之後塵。而承認傀儡組織者。不能不謂爲受此等條約之賜。今吾國若偶不經意。而因通車通郵問題。成爲事實上承認僞國。則他國一旦藉口紛起而承認者。吾國其有奚詞。</p>
<p>或者以爲今日之國際形勢。已有利於日本。吾若堅拒通車。通郵之談判。必使時局趨於危境。不獨未得遠利。或且卽蒙近禍。然而由吾人觀察。國際國際形勢。未必卽有利於日。卽以承認僞國一事爲例。法國投資僞國。傳說已久。但至今迄無動作。德國承認僞國。亦曾言之鑿鑿。然德當局旋亦切實否認。至日美換文之後。美國似有承認僞國之可能。然美當局則已明言談不到此。迄乎最近。日方有英日同盟復活之謠但亦去事實甚遠。凡此種種傳說。方其起也。莫不有聲有色。迨稍過時日。卽可證明其事實之所在。不待明眼人而知其謠言之所由來也。吾人今日。寗能爲國際形勢之說所惑。而自搖其堅决之主張耶。</p>

<p>財相言及汽車業、謂在各實業中其已表示擴大之能力者、殆無過於汽車業、近年汽車產額增高、但以渠所知、用汽車之私出口岛貿易、不能維持原有之活動、英國汽車製造廠現覺海外外人汽車競爭劇烈、難以應付、蓋外人汽車之馬力、以其車身之大與重比較之、實超過英國、汽車之上也、如英車馬力捐不稍縮減、則無以助英車貿易之擴大、故從一九三五年一月一日起、減輕英車馬力捐由一鎊、而爲十五先令、至於馬達自行車之馬力、亦有相等之縮減、</p>
<p>盈餘之分配財相言及三千一百萬鎊盈餘之分配事宜、謂渠對於此事、考慮再三、渠知許多國人對於此事、亦予以多大之注意、渠關於此事之行爲、以兩種原則爲根據、前任財相史諾登曾謂以公道言、盈餘必須用於救濟、在時局恐慌時受苦最甚之階級、此說也、最爲適用、前政府認減俸加稅之舉、乃應付臨時緊急之暫時舉動、而國人亦以此種精神應付之、今渠所有之財力、不足使已減薪俸完全恢復、故一九三一年所減之數、從今年七月一日起恢復其半、此爲第一原則、現有財力旣不足以恢復全俸、則應公允的分配於兩種人民中、卽納稅者、與被減俸者是、現擬依照其貢獻之多寡、而予以分配、此爲第二原則、計恢復救濟失業金需欵四百萬鎊、而恢復減俸半數、亦需三百六十萬鎊云、</p>

<p>今日移用五百萬元、自應於本年撥還也、再上年年終結算、本届實負債額、以減債基金、相抵後、實只負七·五○○·○○○兩之數、以本界之大、負債只此、不可不謂爲奇蹟也、茲提議、請納稅人核准、並採用董事會所擬之一九三四年支出預算案、及所附各項建議、並授權董事會、徵收所擬之各項捐稅、如納稅人認爲適宜、並請准由董事會依照適當條件及方法、籌集一千五百五十萬元之數、以供臨時費預算内之各項指定用途、</p>

<p>俞秘書長談、本年六七月間將在德國舉行第七届國際道路會議、市府方面、擬派六代表前往出席、而以沈局長爲工程學專門人才、故將聘請沈氏爲六代表之一、目下尚在徵求沈氏之意見、卽成事實、亦不過暫行吿假、决無辭職之舉、外間傳聞、當係此說之誤也、</p>

<p>自蔣委員長通令各省市政府、對於　政時期之土地丈量工程、應如期完成、本市方面、卽轉令主管機關、遵令趕辦、記者特向本市主管機關、探詢近况如下、</p>
<p>原定計劃上海市原爲寳山上海兩縣所屬一部分區域、劃併而成、其原屬寳山縣之眞·茹彭浦·吳淞·江灣·高橋·等區、在寳山縣時期、已測丈完竣、所有測丈工程、均經移交土地局保管、故張岳軍氏在本市市長任内、擬於民國二十四年、將全市測丈、俾得工程如期辦理完竣、并經核准測丈經費四十餘萬元、</p>

<p>現在情形自二十一年七月後一部分工作、已得恢復、現在約有五分之一尚未完竣、滬南漕河涇法華閘北引翔楊思塘橋等區、業已全部完竣、惟蒲淞洋涇兩區、尚有一部分未嘗測丈完竣、高行陸行兩區、則尚未開始測丈、現在土地局在華界測丈者、計有兩隊、仍繼續測丈、如經費方面得有辦法、則於民國二十五年亦可完成全市測丈工程、至於特區方面、現亦由土地局測丈隊兩隊分别測丈、在越界築路地段已測丈完竣、現正在特區西區開始測丈、將來再行推及特區全區、所有特區内地主、除外人道契、不再換領土地執業證外、華人方面、仍將逐謀換領權旁落、工作每多困難、業向租界當局一再交涉、故現在進行上尚稱便利云、</p>

<p>何謂第二國際？</p>
<p>答··「第二國際」又名「社會黨國際」或「國際社會黨。」是「第一國際」解散後，各國社會黨人因感覺到無產階級國際聯合之必要而組織的。它於一八八○年由比利時勞働黨發起，歷時八年，開過臨時會數次，至一八八九年始在巴黎舉行第一次大會。第二國際有四種派别··（一）右派——各國的修正派都是的，（二）中派——考茨基等爲其著名人物，形式上雖欲革命，但贊成各派聯合，而修正派讓步故主張不澈底；（三）左派——盧森堡等屬之，是馬克思主義者；（四）極左派——卽無政府主義者。主張雖激烈，但不能實行。第二國際有幾個大缺點··第一，機會主義，認帝國主義者因剝削殖民地之故，勞資是有共同利益的··第二，過分看重民主政治，認無產階級的競選運動頗爲重要；第三，組織鬆懈，分子複雜。在歐戰時，第二國際下的各國社會黨，贊成爲祖國作戰，因此，遂吿消滅。歐戰後又恢復，於一九二○年開大會於日内瓦，會員由英國工黨德法比等國社民黨所搆成，至一九二三年又與第二半國際合併。今名「社會主義勞働者國際。」會員國雖仍不少，但因世界各國内部階級對立的激化，改良主義已不能解放大衆的饑餓；同時，資本主義各國政治上的危機，獨裁政治成爲目前階級間一致的要求，在資本制度下爭取「民主政治」的幻想，已不爲各階級所擁護，不得不趨於破滅。因</p>
<p>是，第二國際的勢力也不得不日益消弱了。　　（九）「獨特的科學的世界觀」指何物？是否卽唯物論？（二十二頁末行）</p>
<p>要明白這句話的意思，先要知道世界觀是何物。所謂世界觀者卽將世界宇宙當作整個的統一體觀察所得的理論而唯物論則爲觀察世界宇宙的，一種看法，其本身不能說是「世界觀」，所以「世界觀」不是「唯物論」。你所指出的「獨特的科學的世界觀」那句話，其意思就是說用辯證唯物論觀察宇宙世界的一種世界觀，因爲它是正確的，故稱爲「科學的」，因爲布爾喬亞是不願採用這種看法的，故稱爲獨特的。世界觀的種類，大别之，可分爲二種；一卽唯物論，他一種則爲唯心論。唯心論者把思維對於存在的關係問題，認爲是精神先於自然而存在，故以世界的本體爲精神，否認物質世界的第一義性，甚至否認它的存在。因此，唯心論者的世界觀，便以精神，思想，「我」或上帝，爲出發點，這些東西活動的結果，便是世界。唯物論者則恰巧相反，他們不但不承認意識（卽精神，思想等决定存在，反認爲存在决定意識。所以唯物論者與唯心論者的世界觀完全不同，一是完全忽略了物質存在，一則認爲物質世界是單獨存在着的，人類的世界觀卽是物質世界在人類意識上的反映。在辯證唯物論者，則不但承認客觀世界可以决定人的生存，而且人類有改變世界的可能。</p>
<p>（十）「馬克恩說」是否誤印？（二十頁九六答··是的，「恩」字應該是「思」字。（未完）</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>最近荷屬東印度實施限制日棉布進口條例，予日商以莫大的打擊，確爲我</p>
<p>國國布推銷的良好機會。據吧城布商邱君所述國布之缺點甚多，國内製造家，苟能加以改良，則推銷於南洋，並非難事。邱君所談之缺點有七。</p>
<p>（一）國貨布疋多憑國内人的需要而織，不合國外銷路的很多。</p>
<p>（二）國貨工廠，缺乏國際眼光，對於各種貨物的銷路，只重主觀的見解。</p>
<p>（三）國内廠家，多以外僑爲奇貨，一切出口貨物，但顧一時小利，沒有遠大的目光。</p>
<p>（四）國貨工廠，資本太少，向外推銷，必須現金，如與價格較廉而以期欵交易的日布競爭，當然遜色。</p>
<p>（五）缺乏本國輪船，致運輸之權，操於外商。例如四十六方英尺的布疋，從香港由渣華公司輪運至吧城，海程一千三百餘英浬，運費須荷幣十三盾五角，如用日輪，由日本運至吧城，經過海程二千三百餘英浬，每一噸布，祗須日金九元，在競爭時期，且嘗减至五元。</p>
<p>（六）華商因無銀行押匯，損失很大，例如日本運貨，由正金銀行押匯，利祇五釐，而由香港或上海辦貨至此，由北多利及安達等銀行押匯，利息至少九釐。</p>
<p>（七）無本國保險公司的保運，損失亦多，例如由日本保險公司保運，保險費每百元祇抽日銀二角半。如由香港運貨，由外商保運，費用每百元至少納華幣一元。</p>
<p>此一段話，不但爲布廠而說，實爲我國一般國貨工廠而說。故國產布疋，雖有推銷南洋的機會，事實上倘於上述七點，沒在改進的辦法，依然希望很少。我很願金融界運輸界保險界大家來注意這個問題，共同起來解除這許多困難，使國貨廠商對於國外貿易，得到一條生路。尤其希望國貨工廠的自身，千萬要調查市塲，調查習慣，調查嗜好，調查需要，要研究轼外消費者的心理，要努力製造品的改良。放遠眼光，不貪小利，本此精神氣力，以與外商相競，或能立足於國際商戰的舞臺。</p>
<p>國發談話</p>
<h3 id="c188">大家來做痴子罷 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 喬劍花女士</p>
<p>在這個年頭裏。一般中等以上的婦女。對於人生四大需要中。認爲最重要的。在算「衣」的一項了。從内衣到外衣。所用的材料。足足有十種以上。單就大衣一種而論。近數年來。不脛而走。着實替外國人做了一律極大的生意。　　回想到十年前的女子。穿大衣的。除了幾位大家閨秀以外。中等階級的人。連夢都做不到。現在竟差不多人衣一襲了　。並且有了冬季大衣還不算。春秋二季也非穿大衣不行。現已從繁華的上海。風行到内地。把他統計起來。爲數確很可觀。如果穿大衣的人。都用國產呢絨做材料。那倒不好算壞現象。然而不然。明明外貨呢絨。還是在有增無减的進口。國貨毛織品。依然鳳毛麟角，在風雨飄搖中支撑着。</p>
<p>最近我還得到一個證據。可以證明我姊妹們在國貨運動會塲中附和着說什麽「提倡」「抵制」多半是說說而已的。因爲我近來也未能免欲的想做一件春季大衣穿。跑了許許多多服裝店。問他們要一件國貨大衣。都異口同聲的說沒有。定做吧。連料子都找不出。但櫉窗裏掛着。每件二十元不到各式各樣很摩登的舶來品——也許是仇貨——做成的大衣。據說一大半已經有了主顧了。在我含悲帶憤的走出店門時。他們倒說。像這樣的「痴子」。沒有看見過第二個呢。　　終於我又費了四毛錢的車資。趕到國貨商場。買了一段呢料。特製了一件眞正國貨的大衣。計算下來。價錢確比較貴些。但是穿在身上。覺得比穿外貨時受良心責備。舒服得多。</p>
<p>姊妹們啊！穿大衣的目的。不過禦寒。如果專講好看。那麽到了國破家亡的時候。做了亡國奴。還要求得難看。我願大家做做「痴子」救救國吧！</p>
<h3 id="c189">國人心理的進步 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>從前中國人多以爲買舶來品爲榮，現在進步了。都以爲買日本貨爲羞恥了。我到老靶子路一個親戚家去，那邊設着日本人的實業組合公司，我就問我的親戚··那公司中國主顧多不多？」親戚說··「眞一個都沒有，中國人那肯進去，全是日本自己人維持的。」</p>
<p>我又到南京路中國國貨公司一瞧，只見進進出出，嘻嘻哈哈的人，手裏拿着國貨。我不禁輕輕地喊「中國人覺悟了。」</p>
<p>第二件事，就是在我學校裏，二年前，級裏同學所用的墨水，大多是Ｗａｔｅｒ—ｍａｎ牌外國貨，全國學校計起來，數目也很驚人呢，而且這種墨水，價錢也比普通貴，約四角左右。現在却不然了，除了少數人以外，大家都採用中國工廠出品的墨水了，尤　最普及的是民生牌。</p>
<p>以後，我希望再進步，　說，在上海的日僑所食所用，全是自己國家帶來的。我們在本國生活，爲什麽　　　用外國貨呢。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3 id="c190">國貨前途的幾個嚴重問題 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>在這喧鬧的提倡國貨聲中，我們對於「婦女國貨年」的前途，雖然因爲已能得到不少，娘兒們的熱烈愛護，很抱着樂觀態度，而滿存欣躍之心，認爲國貨的振興可期，但是我們又要回過頭來，從另一個觀點出發，國貨生產事業失敗的怒濤，是否已曾風平浪靜，整個消滅，事實昭示我們，紗廠絲綢廠，麵粉廠，在現下，那一家不在日暮管窮的路上走，奄奄無生氣，什麽「停工」「減工」的呼聲，旣擾嚷着我們耳鼓，究其現象和趨勢，又是這樣地惡劣，這是國貨界最嚴重的時期，我想無論何人也不能否認，並且，我們更要知道他是内外交迫雙重相逼的由來，然後可謀相當的對策，現在，我敢把他提出幾點來討論，並望獲得迅速的解决。</p>
<p>甲·關於外來侵襲方面的··一·美國提高銀價因爲世界經濟恐慌的日益深刻化，列强也無不惴惴自危，同時，生產過剩與銷路呆滯，使世界的資本主義國，也不得不思利用種種傾銷政策，惟謀獨佔他國的市塲，此次美國提高白銀價格，思用匯兌上的便利，傾銷我國市場，而予我生產事業前途的打擊爲何如，二·仇貨大規模的傾銷全世界人士目前「黃禍」，其嚴重性甚於「洪水猛獸」的仇貨傾銷問題，他現以有組織有計劃的策略，政商聯合，企圖大規模的傾銷，影響國產前途，自不待言。</p>
<p>乙·關於内部自訌方面的··</p>
<p>（一）工潮迭起在國貨年頭裏，而工廠自身常鬧勞資糾紛，本來係先示人以弱點，試思罷工停工，工作停頓，減低生產效能，阻礙國貨進行，爲禍之烈，豈非淺鮮，</p>
<p>（三）同業傾軋跌價競爭，實爲我國市場上最痛心的一回事，今則唯其因市面不佳，價目益見低落，抑且製造次貨，偷工減料，自毁聲譽，日趨極端。</p>
<p>總之，目下我國的國貨生產事業，還在萌芽時代，而不能常受這些暴風雨的侵襲，不過，我在上面所舉數點，當然尤須先謀適當的解决，至於如何解决[</p>
<p>I&gt;路</p>
<p>的辦法，我敢引蔡孑民夫人的談話，「愛好便宜是人們的天性，要挽救國貨界當前的危機，除了民衆自己的團結力外，實在更須要政治的力量去應付，」這樣的幾句話，就作本文的結束。</p>
<h3 id="c191">醒來吧 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>

<p>醒來吧！</p>

<p>新生活運動由軍事領袖振臂一呼後，各地聞風響應的，日有繼起。反顧提倡國貨，無日不在大聲絕呼，各報都出特刋，文字宣傳，促國人猛省，而所得的結果怎樣？實令人聞後，慨喟不已！　　去年的洋貨進口，據調查後報紙所載，共超出九萬萬元。今年二月份的報牛，劣貨呢羢進口，比較去年又超出六倍。研究它的原因；在大都市内，一般靑年男女，多數崇尚摩登，並有喜用洋貸的惡習慣！在内地，農村却早已破了產，劣貨就利用這點，向已破產的農村，大肆傾銷政策。</p>
<p>可憐一般忠誠樸實的農民，那裏有辨别的能力？只知貪它價廉競買！一般奸商又把它改頭換面，只貪有利可圖。那裏在顧到愛國的天職？所以每年的劣貨，仍能在内地市塲大大的活動！</p>
<p>現在國貨應向農村一方面推銷，要促醒農民知道愛用洋貨國家的危亡！並且要使農民有辨别的能力。最好是督促各鄕長辦幾個消費合作社，使農民走進市塲以後，件件都買了國貨，習慣惟後，下次自然是購用國貨了。</p>
<h3 id="c193">農村婦女與國貨 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 冠英</p>
<p>年來國貨運動，在都市中可算提倡的不遺餘力，卽各地城市，也時有提倡的集合遊行；像什麽提燈會呀，化妝演講呀，屢屢見諸報章·反是那佔全國人口百分之八十以上的農村，老是被漠視着無人顧問。在大家總以爲鄕村偏僻之地，鄕民又儉樸成風，服用已多爲國貨</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>得什麽是洋貨’什麽是國貨’祗須有一人提倡’大家就會羣起仿效’並且先入爲主’一經服用’輕易不會改除的。</p>
<p>農村中旣是這樣情形’儘管都市裏國貨運動’鬧得震天價響；倘是對於鄕村方面’仍抱忽視主義’終不　最大的效果·所以現在提倡國貨運動’特别要先從鄕村着手’最具體的辦法’是由各地鄕村小學敎師’或鄕長一類人做領導’隨時主持演講宣傳’或者組織一個服用國貨會’使鄕村婦女也完全加入’最要緊的能合她們認識和辨别國貨的眞僞’所以也要常舉辦什麽輪迴展覽會之類’一方面使他們認識淸楚’一方面又使她們知道購用外貨的危害’她們還會不死心塌地樂用國貨嗎？</p>

<p>（一）　論</p>
<p>我們平常所知道的英　　名的公立中學約有九個、卽文其斯推（Wi　　　　　）愛　（E　on）聖保</p>
<p>羅（Si·P　　　）俄士米到斯推（W　　　iu　）哈樂</p>
<p>（　　arrow）卡推好斯（hatterhou　）羅伯（Ｒ</p>
<p>y）施斯保（Sluewbury）和太奈斯（MerchantT</p>
<p>aylor　）但顯然的、道九個學校不能完全供給英國中學敎育的、那麽還有什麽其他的中等學校、牠們是依靠什麽來維持的、牠們的課程、敎師、敎學法等等又怎樣、這些是我們要研究的問題、</p>
<p>以前在英國、私立的敎育機關的勢力頗大、但這種機關的維持的方法非常複雜、以致在英國中學敎育界中產生很大的混亂、可是近年來的情形稍有變更、號是英國的中學多半已由公家維持、受公家的管理、例如、在倫敦有一百以上的中等學校、（收客四萬五千餘學生）都是受公家之管理的、</p>
<p>倫敦的中等學校的程度亦與我們的初中與高中的程度相同、但是没之點乃在牠們僅招收程度最優的學生、其他程度壞的一律入私立的預備中學、工業學校、中心學校和高級小學、英國的强迫敎育年齡現已延至十四歲爲止、</p>
<p>（二）敎師敎學法和設備</p>
<p>關於敎師的選擇、是很注意的、他們雖沒有德國的嚴格、但標凖亦往往頗高的、例如、敎外國語的敎師須得在外國留學多年、且對於外國語確有深切之研究、不然、則不能得到外國語言敎授之職位的、講到敎學法、他們都是注重實際、注意實騐的、因爲英國人不喜空談只知埋頭硬幹、在各種科目的敎學法中、一般認爲最優趨的、要推外國語言的敎學法了、他們敎外國語時、都是用直接敎學法的、在學生方面頗有顯著的進步、直接敎學法在中學與中心學校中同時採用、至於設備亦是很注重的、例如、在倫敦哈保（Ｈｉｇｈｂｕｒｙ）中學内、關於物理與化學方面的設備異常完全、而其他圖書儀器亦極豐富、惜在生物學方面的設備、未能使人十分的滿意、</p>
<p>（三）課程</p>
<p>關於新近英國中學校課程的組織、與其他國家頗有不同之點、我們試觀兩個中學的課程組織便可知其一斑、例如、温德偉斯（Ｗａｎｄｓｗａｒｔｈ）中學的課程係由敎部頒布的、自十歲至十九歲的公立中學的男生都可採用牠們程課的内容甚廣、包括一種普通的課程和一種高等的課程、關於普通的課程、一方面可以供給一種完善敎育之基礎、另方面頗適合倫敦大學普通入學試騐的標凖、這種普通的課程包含以下數種科目、（一）聖經（任學生自由選讀的）、（二）英文文法、（三）作文與文學、（四）歷史、地理、（五）基本數學、（六）物理、（七）化學、（八）法文、（九）德文與拉丁文、（十）圖畫、（十一）體操、（十二）木工（Ｗｏｏｄｗｏｒｋ）（十三）音樂、高　等的課程是供給學生作大學中的高等科目的考試、或文理商工的考試、大學奬金的考試、文官考試以及倫敦郡參議會中的公務人員考試的凖備的、高等課程學生可以根據他們個人的需要從普通課程的科目中或從經濟學、經濟史、經濟地理、工程圖畫和打樣科目中選擇、作繼續之研究、我們再看哈保中學的課程、牠裏面亦包括以下各種科目、（一）聖經、（任學生自由選擇（、（二）英語與文學、（三）歷史、地理、（四）法文、（五）拉丁、（六）數學、（七）物理、（八）化學、（九）自然研究、（十）美術、（十一）木工與造祇版模型、（十二）唱歌、（十三）體操、</p>
<p>在哈保中學内因爲沒有設立高等課程、所以有許多學生不得不停止他們高深的研究、但是這種數目非常微小、它只不過佔大學入學考試及格的學生中的百分之十、所以凡是應大學入學考試及格的學生仍舊准予入大學、但那些爲奬學金而工作的、或爲節省經費而在校外做研究的、或爲獲得倫敦大學名譽學位者是在例外、在英國的普通中學校内沒有工業的和職業的課程設立的、工業的和職業的課程只在專門學校中才有、但是有許多中學對於商業的知識非常注意、有幾個學校商業的科目設立十六種之多、（四）學費</p>
<p>倫敦的各中學校的收費情形是不一致的、牠們每年彼此的相差數目約自四金鎊十先令至十六金鎊、茲略舉數學校收費之情形如下、以資參考（學校）　　（十二歲以下的男生）（十二歲或以上之男生）</p>
<p>哈保中學九金鎊十金鎊</p>
<p>温德偉斯中學十金鎊十先令十金鎊十先令</p>
<p>斯吹恒（Ｓｔｒｅａｔａｍ）中學十二鎊十二先令十五金鎊十五先令在温德偉斯學校内、倘使兩個或兩個以上的兄弟同時都是繳費生、經過一年之後、每個兄弟每年的學費只須繳七金鎊、凡屬通學生每年一律繳四十三金鎊、一切書籍、文具及運動遊戲入塲劵等費、都包含在此數目之内、</p>
<p>中等學校的學生不是個個都繳納學費的、因爲有百分之二十五至百分之四十的學生是享受奬學金的權利的、倫敦郡參議會設立了兩萬種性質不同的奬學金、但多半是用在中等學校内的因此、在中學考試時、往往產生爭取之現象、倘使學生家長的收入每年减至二百五十金鎊時、學生的奬學金不僅供作他的學費、並且每年還增加他們二十一金鎊作他們家庭的維持費、倘使學生家長的收入每年增加到四百五十金鎊時則不能享受以上之權利的、</p>
<p>在倫敦的中學内平均每個學生的最高敎育費用爲三十九金鎊、而學費乃佔其中三分之一、在中學校内繳費的學生每年享受公家的費用平均要抵小學校或中心學校内的學生兩倍、這一點是普通一般人未注意到的、</p>

<p>這也是預先規定的··火車每一次開行，必須先得到了伊的許可··雖然火車的停止，有時候因爲事實的需要，司機的人不能不自己做一些主張，然而這僅是例外而已。伊並且還再三的誥誡，無論如何，機車上不准汽笛，車站上也不准打鈴。</p>
<p>因爲這一次到奉天去的路程，確然是比上熱河去的遠得多了，所以伊不得不來嘗試一下這種新奇東西。在伊年輕的時候，人們要是見了這種火車，無有不詫爲靈異的了！誰也不會相信這種東西是可以便利人的！現在，伊居然親自嘗試了一件伊年輕時修所認爲絕對不可能的東西，並由這件東西載着伊，從鐵道上望奉天進發，那可不是一椿非夷所思的奇蹟嗎？</p>
<p>可是，伊終於還帶着伊的駕輿，伊想或者這種新奇的，可疑的縮地法，在半途上會受到什麽障礙。</p>
<p>（三）火夫與司機之幸運</p>
<p>在太后沒有上車之前，還有一件事情是必須注意的。其實也是一種很頑固的習慣。就是每當聖駕臨幸任何一座建築物的時候，第一個走進去的，必須是伊自己；要是已經有人在　頭的話，這個人就得先行退出來，必須讓太后走進去之後，其餘的人才能跟着上前。於是在太后未上車之前，便有人先去把那車上所有的工役一起趕下車來，把他們引到一個望不見太后的所在去，齊齊整整地跑着，低下頭，靜候伊老人家上車（一四）</p>

<p>陽光射在面頰上，和煦地温柔地像棉絮般輕暖。柳風微微地吹進每一個人們的心懷裏，大家好像飲了一杯白蘭地似的感有醉意，不，他們的心靈，或去！在翔殷路上，在淞滬路畔，三三兩兩的女學生們，呈露着半截的玉臂，胸前高高地挺聳着兩座隱隱約約的乳峯，且話且笑地走着，有時雜着幾個西裝革履的男生，他們的眉宇之間，育滿着春之氣息，陶醉在春神的懷抱裏！</p>
<p>火車從都市的氛圍裏載來一批批掃墓的客人，他們提着紙錢和草屯，一年一度很誠心誠意的去祭謁他們祖先的墳墓。我看了來來往往掃墓的人們，不禁想起「一二八」爲國犧牲的烈士了，在這「家家墳上燒白紙」的淸明時節，烈士們的陵墓，冷冷凄凄地誰來憑祭呢？</p>
<p>在這春凶惱人的季侯，不知道摧斷了幾多孤獨者的心絃，但也不知道茁生了幾多有情眷屬的愛芽。喂！春神啊！你究竟帶來些什麽東西？是甜蜜？還是苦味？</p>

<p>在蘇州，這眞是破天荒的一大奇觀！</p>
<p>在一星期前的某日，有三百幾十條粗壯的大腿，三百幾十個像皮的輪胎，排了一條長蛇陣，蜿蜿蜒蜒，在車站路上，「虎邱」道旁「瑞光塔」邊「天賜莊」前，飛也似的奔過滾過！這一百六十餘輛首尾銜接，共有一里多長的人力車隊，進「金門」，出「平門」，幾乎繞遍了這座美麗的姑胥城！</p>
<p>每一輛車裏，坐着一個碧眼黃髮，穿着深靑制服，戴着白色小帽的外國水兵。間有幾個是他們同一族類的艶裝異性和孩童。他們已把武器卸除在黃浦江心的兵艦裏，隨帶着的是大大小小的攝影鏡箱，此外幾乎每一個人搖着一柄纔從虎邱山帶回來的麥桿小扇。</p>
<p>蘇州人算不得是怎樣的阿木林，這裏有不少外國僑民，因此蘇州人當然不會用驚異的眼光去釘住一個所謂「外國人」</p>
<p>的。不過像這樣一起比大出喪的導子還要長而好看的淸一色的「外國水兵遊行隊」在蘇州確實還是空前創見，煞是好看。</p>
<p>經調查，這大隊蒞蘇遊覽的水兵，是美國駐滬海軍。事前曾由上海四川路水手靑年會NavyY·M·C·A·和蘇州靑年會接洽妥貼，特派中西幹事多人，分任招待及嚮導之責。水手人數，共爲一百五十七人。大批人力車是預先以每輛大洋一元四角的代價僱定的。這以「天堂」馳名於世的姑胥勝景已於一天工夫内，攝進了他們的鏡箱。當夜，這大批遊客，堆滿了「冷香閣」上帶來的春風，像「西園」羅漢堂裏的彌陀佛般，笑嘻嘻地和蘇州再會。</p>
<p>去年掏河泥，三人爭在一塊兒掏，爭奪的結果，非但所獲無幾，並且打架散塲。今年我們携手合作，竟獲得意外的成績，故每一事件，在有秩序的邁進中，是會得到成功的。</p>
<h3 id="c224">關於談話 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 樂山</p>
<p>昨閱本刋，所載「怎麽樣談話」一·文，不禁有感於中，所以不揣　陋，也來趁熱鬧，說幾句廢話。</p>
<p>沈君說··「有種人，心中有着意思，而詞不足以達，要想說話，而訥訥不能出口，這種人，可算是世界上最可憐的一種！」</p>
<p>其實，這些「訥訥不能出口」的人，乃是生成的缺憾，無可如何，旣不能怨天，也不能尤人。我覺得最難堪，最不甘心的倒是那些辯才無礙，口若懸河的人，却偏偏逼於環境，呌他不敢開口。而那些言辭激昂，雄談驚座的人，也使他噤若寒蟬，不敢談論，甚至蒿目時艱，也只有暗自傷心，和啞子吃黃連似的說不出苦來。唉，這種人才是世界上一種言論不自由的可憐人呢！</p>
<p>「禍從口出，」「多吃飯，少講話，」自古卽然，如今尤烈。這年頭兒說話偶一不愼，往往要招殺身之禍，與其多談僨事，倒不如那些「訥訥不能出口」的人們·來得平安無事，不致於鬧出什麽口舌是非的亂子來！</p>
<p>是的，「談話的藝術，是一種實用的需要，不能缺少的需要，」但是我們中國人，旁的本領沒有，談話的藝術，現在却是大有進步，一切不好的事情，都能够在口頭說起來，是很好聽的。</p>
<p>明明是保全私人軍隊的實力，不肯對敵作戰，却偏會巧立名目，說是「不抵抗主義。」明明是貪生怕死，臨陣而退，却又自圓其說是「縮短陣綫，」「誘敵深入」。</p>
<p>明明是桑間濮上，苟且好合，却强顏掩飾，堂皇其詞··「戀愛自由，」「實行同居之愛」。</p>
<p>明明是推銷滯貨，或是混售改牌的劣貨，却美其名曰··「犧牲血本大减價」。　　唉，照此看來，我們中國人談話的藝術，又何嘗不高明呢？</p>
<p>更正上星期六春遊專號「遊具」篇末三行「荷之以扁」，「扁」係「肩」之誤。末行「自爲恩物」，「自」係「目」之誤。</p>

<p>銅雀瓦，鄴中銅雀瓦，雖有人以其爲曹瞞所造不足貴，然其瓦質細膩，製造較未央爲精，故後人得其殘磚斷瓦，視同瑰寳，文房四譜稱，銅雀瓦陶工以澄細之泥，用細葛布濾數次，和胡桃油製成，實爲他瓦所不及，背顯粗布紋，有建安年號，陶弼詩，煉盡沙石滓，陶成金玉胚，詠其質之堅也。唐錄稱，臺瓦多斷折，間有全者，煮以歷靑，發墨可用，好事者尤愛其古。蔡帖稱，鄴郡三臺舊瓦，以古見貴，色頗靑，肉厚平瑩，姓氏隸古。是皆足爲銅雀勝於未央之證。而相州所造之銅雀瓦，唐宋時尤爲著名，其造法略與澄泥同，惟僞品甚多。歐錄稱··相古瓦誠佳，然少眞者，蓋眞瓦朽腐不可用，世俗徒尚其名耳。後人竟以泥作古瓦狀，埋土中久之，出而斵爲硯，曰此相州古瓦也，現在世上所流傳者，大都類此，則更不足論矣。蘇譜稱，大名等處作假瓦，又可知當時仿造古瓦者，不僅相州爲然，而仿造之佳者，亦實難多得。談苑稱，徐鉉得銅雀瓦，注水試墨卽滲，鉉苑曰，豈銅雀之渴乎，李漢老詩云，魏宫歌舞久成塵，重見陶家幾世孫，銅雀不鳴唯解渴，管城何罪遽遭髠，蓋卽指此，是亦足以證明僞硯之必多渴水也。大抵研究瓦硯，其粗製濫造·一望卽知其僞者，固不必論，若爲眞正唐宋以前之古瓦，則必有一種特色表現，晃氏客錄稱，銅雀瓦騐有三，錫花·雷布·鮮疵·是也，風雨雕鐫不可僞，此言實爲研究瓦硯的不二法門，凡有靑色錫花，布絞渾古，踳駮斑斕，呈現一種天然造成之古意者，誠不可僞爲，韓魏公詠瓦硯詩謂蘚斑入骨尚乾翠，夜雨點漬痕如新，其描摹古硯，最爲恰當的。</p>

<p>第二十七回閨怨暗中消慈懷可忘閒悉醉後起舊事難感</p>
<p>想想當年我作小孩子的時候，換新衣，穿新鞋子，身上揣着壓歲錢，跑跑跳跳，多有意思。所以天氣冷了，只交十二月，天天就盼望着過年，年越來得快越好。現在可不然了，知道過一年就大一歲，非常的怕年來。可是怕也不行，年總是要來的。轉眼靑春過去了，一點兒事業沒有成就。桂枝笑道··你就爲着這個要作和尚嗎？就以海甸而論罷，不如甘二爺的人，可多着呢，這些人都該去作和尚了。那麽，恐怕要成爲和尚世界。積之在路上來回的走着，也就笑了，因道··不能那樣說，各人的情形不同。靑年人只要精神上得着安慰，挨餓受冷那都是全不在乎。我總覺得這世界沒有一件事情會讓我順心的。唉！他說着這話，不住的搖頭，而且還是連聲歎氣。桂枝看他這情形，心心裏還有什麽不明白，於是默然的靠住了門框，沒有把這話向下說去。積之還是將兩隻袖子籠住了，在路上徘徊着。桂枝的心裏，本難很安靜的，沒有一些子别的思想。對於甘積之這個人，决對不會有什麽留戀。但是他旣然在門口這樣徘徊着，自己先避了進去，也好像是無禮。也就只得含了笑容，始終在那裏站着。積之由他自家門口走起，經過桂枝的大門，走過四五户人家，復又走回去。他就是這樣的來回走着，也不知道有多少次數。他低了頭，將眼睛望着在地面上，不看桂枝，也不看别的</p>
<p>，就是這樣的走着。看他那樣子心裏定是煩悶得厲害，有什麽要說，而又不能說，苦悶在心裏，找不出一個解决的方法出來。（三六五）</p>

<p>— 馬宗融</p>
<p>叮咚！叮咚！噹！…噹！…叮咚！……一派鐘聲從一座巍峨的敎堂發出。那敎堂門前裝着非常美觀的鐵欄，無數老少男女，正不斷地向裏面擁去。敎堂内部極爲華美，此時人已黑壓壓地擠滿了，後進的人伸頭只望得見祭壇，當中一列一列的椅子上坐的或跪的男女已沒法看見他們的項背了　！但老是推進不已，前面站着地人脚跟總難牢固，被擁得漸次貼緊了祭壇前的欄杆。沒在人叢中的人感着越擠越緊，轉動不靈，此時占便宜的只有身量高長的了。</p>
<p>祭壇上燈燭輝煌，大敎士披着前後兩片龜板似的金繡禮服，後面兩個童子替他牽衣，伺候起跪；他手裏拿着不知什麽棒椎，左一幌，右一幌，當中也幌幌，音樂是嗡嗡汪汪地響着··欄杆山，祭壇的兩旁各有一列與平日衣着不同的敎士，時唱時輟，大約是依的一定儀式。大敎士每隔三幾分鐘在壇上取下一隻彷彿酒缾大小的玻璃缾，在燈光前將缾口傾向下面·這缾貼底的一半是不透明的凝結物，其餘一半雖有斑痕，却能透光。大敎士這種反覆的動作，很像變戲法的向觀衆表示「此中無假」，將幻出什麽奇景似的。於是攢攢的衆頭爭着相望，而善男信女却用手在胸前連連自畫十字，口中且念念有詞，看去態度是十分虔誠的。</p>
<p>但是如此經過半點鐘，一點鐘，…那缾老是原樣，敎堂中的人聲就有些轟動起來。遲遲又久，忽然一個角落裏起了一片猪玀」－「臭貨」－…的呌駡聲，全體加以響應，於是鬧得一榻糊塗，幾個老太婆也都哽哽噎噎地跟着呌駡··「猪…玀！…臭貨！…不…給…我們…的…靈顯呀！哦！…多麽不…幸呀！…」這樣鬧着，大敎士仍是非常鎭靜，只把缾翻得更勤，兩旁的敎士仍舊時起時輟地唱着。陡然，缾内的凝結物軟化了。流動了…啊！…啊！…快活的呼聲，把人耳都震得聾了！這時許多男女又忙忙地畫十字，唸唸有詞起來。　　「這究竟是怎麽一回事？不要儘把我們裝在悶戎蘆裏子。」讀到此處，必有人要這樣問吧。</p>
<p>這是意大利以火山特　的近海名城拉波里的一胭盛大節日－聖簡納洛血的液化節。據傳聖簡納洛是於三○五年在布佐列殉道而死的，當把他投諸猛獸時，猛獸退避，結果遂被殺害。後來把他的屍首搬到拉波里時，同時把他的一缾頸血也一併保存在拉城的大敎堂裏。在舉行迎葬禮的時候，這缾殷枯凝結的血一觸大主敎聖，塞維列的手卽化成液體，如新盛的血汁。自是之後每年都要顯一次這樣的靈蹟於大敎堂或聖齊亞拉敎堂，節日爲五月第一星期六日或九月十六日，拉城居民認爲本城有危難時，也有祈請顯示靈蹟之舉。求之不得，就加以怒駡，責備他爲一城的主神而不負保民之責。旣得便又歡呼禮敬。這眞也算得一種奇風異俗了！</p>
<p>迷信幼稚到了這步地位，在文明的歐洲，在歐洲文明之母的意大利，的確有些使人驚嘆，怪不得文明最古的中國同善社等類的組織和靈學雜誌等類的刋物到處都是了！</p>

<p>— 伊人</p>
<p>我找到前艙底一個角落，那兒是茶房們鳩聚的所地··一個下層的牀上，正橫躺着一個老茶房在抽鴉片烟；燈光照着他底凹陷的腮和蒼滑的隆起的顴骨，光釉釉的，我看過了他全身的筋肉痙攣般地隨着他底深吸而收縮—吸過了那口烟，便見識他做泡的高妙技術了··他简直全然不用銅元；就只是用一雙巧妙的手和十個靈活的指頭，很敏捷，很精巧，很純熟，很稱心地掄着，轉着，活動着。比之前述的兩個女人，他底技術要高百倍！</p>
<p>我出了船艙繞過船頭，對着走欄敞開了門的，便是帳房底一間小小住室，裏面牀上橫躺着一個眼睛深陷，幾莖疏疏的鬍髭裏露出一排參差的黑牙的帳房師爺。他底胸前安置着一個紫檀木的盤子，盤中除很客氣的烟具外，還有茶壺和紙烟台子。他嘴裏含着燃了的紙烟，左手揑着烟槍，右手用烟針挑着一大它烟膏在燈上燒着，烟膏越燒越融越澎漲，吊下去也越長··他把針上的烟膏儘燒着儘燒着，直等到烟膏垂下去，約五六寸長，粘在針尖處，只頭髮粗再過百分之一秒的時間便要掉下去的一刹那，他把手指將針一掄··烟膏便在針尖成了一顆圓圓的大泡。他再把針向烟槍底錘上一插，針一抽，一顆很圓的泡便正正的安置在錘心了。他右手把嘴裏的紙烟取下放上紙烟台，左手揑的烟槍隨着便塞入口中；他使勁地吸着，似乎要把它吸到他底内臟底盡頭一般，隨後他左手揑的烟槍剛一抽出，右手揑的茶壺底嘴又插入他底嘴裏去了··他底技術眞是神妙到了，絕頂了！</p>
<p>中國人有些世界各色人種所不可企及的絕技。這些絕技，一經政府提倡或外國紳士們贊美，便是可以進步到絕頂的。譬如救國發生過實效的「國術」，在柏林展覽增加了國家底光榮的「國盡）……</p>
<p>等，都是很顯著的例子。做鴉片烟泡底神妙的絕技，雖說於救國無甚裨益，於强種不無小疵；然而其爲可佩的絕技一也！有着這些可佩的絕技的中國的，確實是可以驕傲的！（完）</p>

<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>黎明的時候，妻在牀上呻吟，醫院裏的人在奔波忙碌着，爲的是有一個小生命卽將下地了。</p>
<p>我獨自蹀躞在門外，心裏充滿了興奮和焦躁。一方面擔心着妻衰弱的身體經不起生產的痛苦，一方面又深恐孩子在娘肚裏出了危險，因爲我們大家盼望有一個孩子來塡補人們生活裏的缺陷已有好久了。</p>
<p>種種聲音響在我的心上，並把我的心磨礱着，心裏是只存在着一個希望；但願大小都平安。</p>
<p>終於，「呱呱」的哭聲從房裏傳出來了，我的心上像落下了一塊大石頭似的，連忙三脚兩步的跑進房去。</p>
<p>房裏還保留着生產時的凌亂的景象，孩子却已由一個女護士用襁褓裏好了。她一見到我，便笑嘻嘻的抱着送上來說··　　「恭喜！恭喜！一位男寳寳。」</p>
<p>我從她手裏把孩子接過來，瞧着孩子的淸秀的臉，又瞧着窗外初放的曙光，心頭不禁微微感到一種喜悅。這喜悅，倒不是因爲生了男孩。在眼前這時代裏，重男輕女的傳統觀念，雖還在一部分舊人物心上存在着，但却不存在我心上。我只欣幸着未來的社會裏多了一位戰士，此外便是由於對現代女性失望而生出來的一種希望男性的戰士多量地產生出來使世界早日煥然改觀一下的心。</p>
<p>我抱着孩子走到妻的牀邊去。妻雖然在生產時經歷了許多痛苦，但身體却還是很康健的，容貎也較上次生產時豐腴。她瞧見我抱了孩子過來，便笑着呌我把他放在她被内，一壁又喚我去休息。她顯然並沒有一刻忘記過我，而且對於我的身體，也比對孩子關心。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c232">談體育 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 敦龐</p>
<p>說到注重體育，總要推斯巴達，「李考格憲法」中規定；男子生後，卽須受身體檢查，質弱者卽棄諸山野，健者則由父母撫育至七歲。七歲以後，卽入國立的敎育所，受鍜鍊主義的硬敎育。至二十歳歲，入軍隊專心學兵術，一朝有事，卽須凖備出陣。三十歲後，成爲武士，始准娶妻，歸居私宅。女子方面，亦以强健的身體及勇敢的精神爲婦德之主。</p>
<p>斯巴達實施這種體育訓練的目的，我們且不管他，其辦法也許過於嚴格，束縛國民之自由精神，不足爲訓。然而，有一點是非常値得我們的注意的，就是，「李考格憲法」所注意的，是整個民族的健全，不是少數人的畸形的發達。在歷史上，許多民族的出名，往往由於這民族中所產生的英雄。斯巴達沒有特殊的英雄，但它是一個偉大的民族，因爲說到英雄，它的個個國民都是英雄。</p>
<p>中國自蒙「東亞病夫」的惡謚之後，漸漸也知注重體育，到了今日，在表面上，體育成績也算不錯了，運動會年年舉行，各學校皆有選手，就是國際的運動會中，我們也早已有健兒去顯身手。然而，在實際上，誰都知道這是怎麽一回事江不但體育界的眞實情形，令人悲憤，甚至國民的大衆的體育精神，反受這些「健兒」的損害。試看今日各學校之運動塲，除了少數錦標的逐鹿者在用武之外，尚有何人在作合理的運動？多數的學生，還不是形容憔悴，顏色枯稿？</p>
<p>聽說聯華公司近出「體育皇后」一片，是諷刺錦標主義的體育運動的，我沒有去看過，不知内容如何。</p>

<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>山路崎嶇陡削，本是意計中事，但這西天目山的路，實在也太　側了；因爲一面是千迴百折的淸溪，一面是奇岩矗立的石壁，兩邊都開鑿不出路來，故而這條由細石巨岩疊成的羊腸曲徑，只能從樹梢頭繞，山嘴裏穿。我們覺得坐在轎子裏，有三條性命的危險，所以硬呌轎夫放下轎來，還是學着詩人的行徑，緩步微吟，慢慢兒的踏上山去。不過這微吟，到後來終於變了急喘，說出來倒有點兒不好意思。</p>
<p>扶壁沿溪提脚彎腰的上去，過五里亭，七里亭。山爬得愈高，樹來得更密更大，巖也顯得愈高愈奇，而氣候尤變得十分的冷。西天目山產得最多的柳杉樹的幹上針葉上，還留有着點點的積雲，岩石上儘是些水晶樣的冰條。尤其是獅子峯下，將到獅子口高峯禪師塔院快的路上，有一塊倒覆的大岩石，橫廣約有二三十丈，在這岩上倒掛在那裏的一排冰柱，直是天下的奇觀。</p>
<p>到了獅子口去休息了數刻鐘，從那茅篷的小窗裏向南望了一下，我們方纔有了爬山的自信。這獅子口雖則還在半山，到西天目的絕頂「天下奇觀」的天柱峯頭，雖則還有十幾里路，但從獅子口向南一望，已經是漂渺凌空，巨岩小阜，烟樹，雲溪，都在脚下；翠微岩華石峯旭日峯下的那一座禪源大禪寺，只像似畫裏的幾點小小的山齋，不知不覺，我們早已經置身在千丈來高的地域了，山茶淸　，山氣冱寒，山僧的談吐，更加是幽閑别致，到了這獅子口裏，展拜展拜高峯禪師的墳墓，翻閱翻閱西天目祖山志上的形勝與藝文，這裏那裏的指點指點，與志上的全圖對證，對證，我們都已經有點兒樂而忘返，想學學這天目山傳說中最古的那位昭明太子的父親，預備着把身體捨給了空門。</p>
<p>說起了昭明太子，我却把這天目山中，最古的傳說忘了，現在正好在這裏補叙一下。原來天目山的得名，照萬曆臨安縣舊志之所說，是在「縣西北五十里，卽浮玉山，大藏經謂爲宇内三十四洞天，名太微元蓋之天。太平寰宇記曰··水緣山曲折，東西巨源若兩目，故曰天目，西目屬於潛，東目屬臨安。梁昭明太子，以葬母丁貴嬪，被宫監鮑邈之譖，不能自明，遂慚憤不見帝（武帝），來臨安東天目山禪修，取漢及六朝文字遴之，爲文選一十卷，取金剛經，分爲三十二節，心血以枯，雙目俱瞽。禪師誌公，導取石池水洗之，一目明；復於西天目山，取池水洗之，雙目皆明。不數年，帝遣人來迎，兵馬候於天目山之麓，因建寺爲壽慈院。」</p>

<p>「爸爸，巧格力呢？……」孩子跳到父親身邊，想伸手到大衣的口袋裏，嚷　着說。「啊，今天沒有買，明天吧，乖乖的！」父親抱起小女孩子，拉了那哥哥的手，走進書室來*</p>
<p>了。</p>
<p>那八歲的男孩子，又拍了拍口袋，失望似的，撅着嘴說··</p>
<p>「已經三天沒有買了，爸爸天天騙我們！」</p>
<p>五歲的女孩，從父親手裏滑下來，跑向門口去，一邊嚷着··「陸媽，你說爸爸回來會買糖*</p>
<p>的，你騙我！」</p>
<p>做父親的人，看着小女孩跑跳着的背影，那活潑又伶俐的樣兒，飄動的頭髮，不能不使他想起亡妻的情影了。又回頭看見那大的孩子，正玩弄着兩個美麗的小皮球，臉上還帶點生</p>
<p>氣的模子，從側面看去，眞活像亡妻的儀態呢。不知怎麽的，他心裏非常不安起來，好像抱歉又好像羞慚那樣，從孩子身上把眼光移開，看向窗外去了。雖然窗外有初開的碧桃和嬝娜的稚柳，滿眼都籠着春意，但那亡妻的影子，還是淸晰地在他的眼前，彷彿看見她在微笑，又彷彿她蹙着眉，變成怨恨的樣子，這一切，固然在他的記憶裏刻劃得很深了，一想起她*</p>
<p>，那十年同居生活中的一切，就會淸晰地一一記憶起來，在同居的時候，卽使偶然有一點不幸的事故，也是很平靜地就曾過去了的。至於她死後，更把對於妻的回憶，是件可貴的事。可是今天，一想起已故的愛妻，心裏却覺得抱歉起來，卽使對於孩子，也幾乎有點自責的樣于，何况這川天來，連孩子們愛吃的東西都忘掉買呢。</p>
<p>這時侯，大的孩子好像忘却了剛才的失望，走到他身邊說；</p>
<p>「爸，我們學校裏下星期天送龍華去旅行，你不是說過同我們去玩嗎？」「春假我同你們玩兩天，好不好？目」</p>
<p>「好，可是你不要忘記哪！」孩子又想起三天沒有買的糖了。</p>
<p>「那裏會忘記呢，……」他撫摩了一會孩子的頭，又說··「停一會有個客人來，我們便一起出去吧。」他正沒有機會對孩子說這話，已經爲難了好一會咧。</p>
<p>孩子喜歡得跳了起來，那小女孩子聽着聲音也從外面進來了，性急地向着哥哥。「今天爸爸有客人來，同我們去散步咧。」他一邊指着父親的膝頭說··「爸爸，來的是什麽客人呢？」</p>
<p>父親躊躇了一下，「這裏還沒有來過，那客人一定很喜歡你們，你們等着吧！」孩子們最沒在耐性的，一聽父親說這樣的話，便焦燥地等着客人。在失了母親的家庭中，雖有兩位道地的女僕管領着，可是在孩子們總覺得太寂寞了，所以一有新鮮的事情，便格外高興着。最後還是父親哄着他們到天井去玩皮球，才高興地走了。</p>

<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>最近，東北僞組織中的重要份子，鄭孝胥，熙洽兩人親赴日本；在東京和日首相齋藤及拓相永井等，會商僞組織的經濟問題。結果；在東四省的經濟關係上，訂下了一個很足痛心的契約；這是又給了日本在吾國版圖上一個很好的發展機會！這不獨吾們中國當局對這事件不可忽視，就是那些和僞滿有經濟上關係的各國，也都應該加以深切的注意的。</p>
<p>本來，吾東北自從成立傀儡國以後，所有的一切權限，固早已操之於日人的掌握之中；行止自如，調度節制悉聽其便，又有誰敢加以干涉？其經濟的連鎖更自不待言了。因爲這事實的實現，果然早在鄭熙兩逆等赴日之前，可是目今更顯明地暴露了日本在東北經濟上的種種掠奪，而猶不自爲足，還欲作更進一步的操縱。</p>
<p>東四省今已成爲日本人生產經濟的殖民地，這已是無可諱飾的事實。它滑稽把戲的演出，徒然不過是騙騙局外人而已。然而，滑稽戲儘管地滑稽，但終逃不出欺騙的範圍，於是矛盾百出的行爲，也就層出不窮了。這種醜態，在吾們看了也覺得有些赧然，而在他們則仍把原形赤裸裸地現露出了。</p>
<p>日前報載··鄭熙二逆赴東京之結果，商定了一個日滿經濟提携辦法，同時還訂下了一張賣身契約··「滿洲門户開放，歡迎各國投資滿洲」。「列强各國必須承認日本在滿洲經濟的特殊地位」。其内容的要點就是··「開發產業，滿洲當然爲原料國，但將來預備發展爲工業國計，勸誘日本之財政與技術的援助，和日滿經濟團體的合作……」「並歡迎列强各國資本家之公正投資，惟不得與根據日滿經濟之特殊性，和日本的特殊利益相抵觸……」這就是滿洲國的所謂門户開放了原則。其實那根本上，日本早已認定了東四省是其工業原料的供給地；是以，目前滿洲的不建設工業，是可無疑議確定步驟。卽如將來滿洲在某係環境下，有建設工業國的機會時，也須由日本的資本和技術來促成的。所以「門户開放，歡迎各國投資」之一說，亦不過是日人的姑弄玄虚，借着做一個騙人的幌子罷了。他們的實際上恰是很顯明地在吿訴你——拒絕各國投資滿洲了。可不是嗎？那就是··「惟不得與根據日滿經濟之特殊性，和日本的特殊利益相抵觸……」他們的藴蓄，已在上面的一語包刮凈盡矣；用意在此，毌庸多贅</p>
<h3 id="c255">此之謂大驚小怪歟？ <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>說起來萬分慚愧而且痛心，我國人對於自己國家的事物，不知道是因爲過於繁雜廣博，或是以爲無足輕重，都不甚瞭然，好像也不想瞭然；反而外國人所明白的，比我們更要精細淸楚。政治經濟等情狀不消說，這些和各國的關係異常密切，他們自然非注意不可；卽其他瑣屑之事，他們也一樣不肯忽視。他們所以如此留心我國的國情，並不是外國人喜歡多管閒事，倒是他們别有用心。舉一則實例來看，就像日本之對於我國，凡事凡物，他們都要加以熱切的注意和研究。我國某山有金礦，某海有鮮味，某地產米最多，某處出絲甚夥，他們都調查得很詳盡。至若各地方的政治情形，社會狀况，以及人情，風俗，習慣等，他們也並不隔膜。總之，他們之於我國國情，可說是無所不知，無所不曉了。尤其關於東北的情狀，他們更是洞悉無遺。他們之圖謀東北，並不是一朝一夕之事；其處心積慮，爲時已甚長遠了。兵家有方··「知己知彼，百戰百勝」。列强之企圖侵犯我國，所取的大約就是這一種方略了，所以他們皆致力於研究我國的國情，這是個多麽可怕的戰術呵！</p>
<p>的確的，也許是得到了人家的好敎訓，我國人近來對於日本國情，也頗關心起來了。九一八而後，我國受此大打擊，對日本常存戒懼之念。時至今日，國人雖同抱收地雪恨的决心；然畢竟實力未足，要達此目的，誠非易事。惟國人已知道想收復失地，報雪奇恥，一方固要臥薪嘗胆，忍辱含垢；他方對於日本國情，亦不可不加以充分之留意。於是一班有識者便相率努力於此種工作。我國各地先後已成立好幾個究研日本國情的團體，從　於日本之研究，市上也已發見關於討論日本政治社會經濟諸現象的刋物。許多名流學者的演講，亦時常象日本問題作　林。我們雖不敢　　這樣努力下去，就會得到什麽效果；但這至少可以作爲今後對付日本的一種凖備。這未始不是一件値得欣幸的事實。　　但我國人的愛國熱度，旣超不過五分鐘；那末關於日本問題的研究工作，恐怕也是一時的興奮而已，未能持久。我們正爲此抱無限的疑慮；誰知感覺敏銳的日本人，却早就在那裏大驚小怪，着急起來了。昨日日文上海日報便登着這樣一節新聞··「際茲百業式微時代，經營雜誌業者，亦因匯兌關係，受重大打擊，不惟家庭主婦與職業婦人，均謀節省，卽公司商店，亦因範圍縮小改組等關係，大衆雜誌之購買力，銳然减少，一方中國人的智識階級，最近因研究日本熱，關於日本出版之經濟雜誌，與其他專門科學雜誌，銷路遞增，如此可拍的華人研究日本熱，豈得認爲皮肉的現象歟」。</p>
<p>「做賊心虚」日本對於近來我國人向他們的書店多交易幾本雜誌，便說是華人研究日本熱，便惶恐不安，認爲不是皮肉的現象，這實在有點神經過敏，有類於杞人之憂天，可憐又復可笑。但只此一端，亦足見他們凡事之深憂遠慮了。反觀我國，不要說是外國人研究中國熱這類事不放在我們的眼中；就是有敵人想來測量我們的要塞，窺探我們的砲臺，恐怕我們也是熟視無睹呢！他們日本之研究我國，爲時已久，成績篤著；其國内所出版關於叙述中國情形和討論中國問題的書籍雜誌，何止千百種，我們幾曾注意到。他們成立有各種研究會，對於我國各事物都加以詳細的檢討。他們又時常組織各樣考察團，到我國各　去作實地觀察和調查，這些帶有侵略惟的舉動，我們也未嘗覺到有什麽可懼。觀此，我國東北四省土地这喪失，並非無因了。</p>
<p>以我看來，日本之以我國人多讀幾本日本雜誌，便覺得大驚小怪，實未免過慮。我們現在縱使有人熱心研究日本，研究也只是研究吧了；我們絕不會像他們之研究我國那樣，别具野心，是要作爲將來侵略樺太或九州之預備。我們研究的結果，或許可以多認識一點日本的眞面目和野心所在，至多也不過使日本今後對於吞併我國的陰謀上蒙着一層阻力，你們儘管放心呵！</p>

<p>— 寄塵</p>
<p>當革命的狂瀾衝碎了封建的枷鎖，一切都陷入驚風駭浪中的時候，我們的婦女們也從桎梏中竭力掙扎着了；無疑地，這是婦女界一綫美麗的曙光。</p>
<p>在大小脚過渡的時代，我們曾發現過不少偉大的奇蹟，同時，雞鳴狗盜之輩，也乘機活躍着，在「婦女解放」的口號震驚了人們的意識時，顯然社會上已被阢隍不安的神情所侵襲了！</p>
<p>這是十分彰明的事實，中國數千年來禮敎的絆索牢牢地束縛着每個婦女的身心，而每個婦女在水深火熱的環境生存着，心靈上早已感到世界毁亡，生命幻滅的悲哀了；但，「三從四德」的閨中格言，像古廟中宏亮的銅鐘，恐怖的聲浪深深地嵌進了人們的心坎。這魔力，不可思議地，降服了强烈的火燄，遏制了澎湃的情感。雖然，在這樣如火如荼的環境裏，也曾發現了卓文君大胆的淫奔，至今傳爲當爐佳話；和花木蘭英雄式的投軍，博得萬人景仰；但，前者畢竟「爲君子所不取」，後者也被人家譏「雌老虎」了。眞的，遑論蓬門裏的小家碧玉，就是紫棘門牆的大家閨秀，也不過平凡地在牛馬奴隸的地位裏偷偷渡過了靑春，一直到雞皮鶴髮，這樣完結了整個的人生！</p>
<p>跟着婦女解放而羣情沸騰着的便是「自由戀愛」了，無無如何，這是婦女界勇敢奮鬥的成績，他們從幽靈般的地獄裏掙斷了慘無人道的「脚帶」，撕毁緊身的「馬甲」，衝破了禮敎的藩籬，慢慢地跑薔薇的芳徑，在花明柳暗裏發抒女性所特具的柔和的情感——一個少女，一個　春時代的少女，當她感到内心的落　或生　的　　的時候，可以自由　放射她犀利而澄淸的眼光，去找尋安慰，去追求蜜一樣甜的甘露！</p>
<p>但是，覊束慣了的身心，將它驟行解放，便像脫了纏的野馬一樣，整個的人羣又捲進了浪沸潢池的慾海，於是社會又陷進畸形的狀態裏了！</p>
<p>這是無容諱言的，現代的戀愛，已成爲塑金的偶像了，大腹便便的人們可以左擁右抱，金屋藏嬌；公子哥子們可以玩弄女性於股掌之上，而女性們也以黃金而轉移其目光，以黃金爲戀愛的標的了。因此，婦女們剛走到荆棘遍地的盡頭，又誤堕烏烟瘴氣迷霧中了——當女性們攫得了自我的靈魂時，又被屠夫掛上鈎子，可以善價而沾了。　　人們說··「女性們像羊肉狗肉一樣，只要有相當的貸價，便可以佔有她整個的肉體和整個的靈魂的」。這雖是女性厭惡者過激的論調；但，中國婦女的路程畢竟是形成三角式了··從暮氣沉沉，變爲發揚蹈厲，現在又開着倒車，變成驕奢淫佚了！</p>
<p>試問雙方祗憑藉着純潔的愛，而不爲利誘的靑年男女，能有多少？</p>
<p>婦女解放的結果便是這樣麽？沒有貞操，沒有眞潔！所謂摩登女性們祗把三寸金蓮，解放成六寸圓膚；固有的婦女的美德，視若敝屣，而解放成放蕩浪漫！然而她們的靈魂呢，已被黃金吞噬了！她們戴着桂冠，站在雪茄烟香檳酒的雲端裏伸出了粉白的大腿，突起着前胸的乳峯，向着人們露出驕幹的笑呢！　　「在這婦女揚眉吐氣的國貨年，女性們應該革去一切舊的渣滓，而厲行自我的新生了」！人家說。</p>
<p>是的，在火山上奏着靡的樂曲，跳着狐步的舞蹈，這樣葬送了有爲的靑春，在地球爆烈的時候，還不是只剩些　　　　的　　　可　的骷髏！</p>

<h3 id="c260">革烟記 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 奔</p>
<p>自己知道，生平惟一的弱點，就是「因循」。除了是自己最快意的事，做起來確確實實是很賣勁外，其他便總是在「因循」中躭誤了。無無是做事，無無是對於生活上的一些不良的癖性。比方就拿吸烟來講吧。明知是有害無益的，心坎裏明明是不想吸它；旣吸會了以後，又明明要想方法把它革除。但，我與烟的關係是有了整個八的的歷史。</p>
<p>大槪是十五年秋季，其是正在Ｃ城一個中學讀書，雖然還插高了一年的班，也還感到班上的程度太淺，功課是確不大要理會，還要比一般的好。但自己很「因循」，不知道把寳貴的光陰移用到其他的自修上去，鎭日價只管在房間裏呌着「無聊」。碰着對坐的一位同學Ｃ君，也正同樣的感到無聊。於是兩人每日便不停的閒談，閒談之不足，更繼之以吸烟喝茶，於是烟這毒害的東西便正式與我發生關係。</p>
<p>迨到吸上了癮，不說謊話，心裏是常時懊悔的，因爲懊悔，就常常立志革烟，但結果總是沒有革掉得了，到如今，八年之中，轟轟烈烈地革烟，總有五次以上了。最久的革了上一個多月，其餘的多是支持三五天便又放弛了。這過程裏··起初彷彿是有决心似的，但等烟癮來了，這决心便像雲縷似的隱消了，於是有兩種阿Ｏ式的精神安慰法。其一是··自己生平沒有别的壞路—不打牌，也不賭博，不喝酒，也不嫖娼，僅僅這一點吸烟的嗜好，何必那樣認眞的想革，若比起一般的人來不還規矩得多麽！於是革烟的心頓然冷了半截。其二是··所謂人類社會，文明世界，原來就靠一些花樣在撑持，倘果吸香烟的人都沒有了，那還成什麽世界？而且一個人短短幾十年壽命，若專門向好的路上走，那簡直是白痴，是自討苦吃，於是革烟的心遂頓然整個兒冰冷了。</p>
<p>革的心旣冷了　，於是乎吸的心就騰熱起來，順手掏掏口袋，有零錢馬上就會去買，甚至是破鈔也不在乎。在這裏，有一種劇烈的矛盾，就是烟買來了，到底是吸還是不吸？結果總是吸戰勝了不吸。</p>
<p>在這裏，我有一種說不出的慚愧！記得三年前住在江灣的時候，曾有幾個比較親近的朋友，爲着勸我革烟，餉過我一頓豐飫的飲食，結果也是沒有革掉得了，現在會面時，還是神仙般的嘴上啣着一枝，心裏確是十三分的慚愧。</p>
<p>這道瑆，確乎有些奥秘，爲什麽這樣革掉不了呢？自己明知它有害，又明知道要革，却又怎樣也革不了。八年了，到今朝才悟透，「爲的是沒有眞正的决心」！所以就一逕革不了。現在我是决心要革了，理由有下面這幾項··</p>
<p>（一），現在吸烟實在太不合算了，十個子一包的金鼠牌飛漲到了十五個，八個子一包的大仙女，也漲到了十一個。先前還可以，吸不起了金鼠牔，就降格吸大仙女，再降而吸小仙女。現在却因環境的關係，覺得不吸美麗牌太不像樣兒了，但這開支實在不小，每日兩包就要「二只八開」，實在太不經濟了。</p>
<p>（二），自己壓根兒有些墮落的嫌疑了，因循，苟且，不努力，不長進，都是可怕的地方，絕對沒有自己安慰自己的餘地了，應該振作起來，繼續幾年來的苦鬥，以與惡劣的環境肉搏，最要的就先從革烟做起。</p>
<p>（三），最近有所謂新生活運動，細細檢閱一下他們的草案，覺得倒是中國人自救的辦法，革烟也是其中的一項。這種運動，貴在我們老百姓自己起來實行，光靠大人先生們呐喊，是不會有什麽好結果的。我爲着要做一個健全的中華國民，也就决心把烟革了。</p>
<p>（四）烟的害處實在太大，八年來把我的頭腦弄得太不淸楚，暈暈沌沌，再不革，將來更不得了。</p>
<p>（五）爲接受一些朋友的規勸，洗滌我過去積壓在心頭的慚愧，我也非把烟革除不可。</p>
<p>我革烟了，我决心革烟了。</p>

<p>編者先生··</p>
<p>我現在二十歲了。在十六歲時，由我父之友，介紹到萬惡的上海一家舊式商店學業，可說是判定有期徒刑三年。不幸的父母，在前年雙雙去世，剩下二位兄長。近來因營業不佳，家中呢，眞所謂家徒四壁；我呢，在去年冬季，算我的幸運，三年有期徒刑已滿，承蒙先生開恩，每月付薪俸大洋二元。現在家中時常來信，要我寄錢還債。我每月只收微微薪俸，自顧不暇，那有錢來還債呢？我現在想改行，但因一個小小職員，文淺學薄，社會上並無我立足之地；如不改行，又要受着經濟壓迫。我左想右難。</p>
<p>先生，你是靑年指南針，我在黑暗的迷途中，懇求。</p>
<p>先生給我一條光明大路。諒必　　先生不會給我失望的。最好請你在最短期間在貴報上給我一個答覆。耑此敬祝</p>
<p>文安　　　　陸家榮謹上</p>
<p>答··陸君這封來信，確是一個難題，編者除了與你一樣的左想右難之外，實在不能爲你謀一個馬上可以發財的辦法。你想改行，想找一個報酬較豐的職業，這也是一個辦法，但是你又感覺到工作技能之缺乏。不過，依編者之意就是你有了本事，是否就會找到好職業，却還是問題。「人浮於事」「失業激增」這兩件事是我們常常聽到的。在失業者羣當中，也不乏有工作技能的人，他們爲了飢寒的交迫，更願以廉價出賣他們的榮働，就是如此，有許多人却依然找不到事做。所以我不敢勸你改行，因爲你是否能够改行，我固然不知，就是能够改行，也未必就能解决經濟困難。現在的店員，學徒，他們的酬報不都是差不多的麽。至於學習工作技能，我雖然很贊成，却也不敢保證你因此就能獲得好的職業。所以，你如果想在現狀下以個人的努力，謀生活的解决，那是沒有十分把握的。</p>
<p>但是，解决經濟因難，也不是沒有辦法，不過，若以爲這祗可以個人的努力去解决，就未必有點左想右難罷了。因爲現在一般倚仗勞働爲生的人，在這個社會内，大家都感覺着窮困，像你這種情形，並不祗你一個，大約是大部分店員，學徒所共同遭受到的悲哀罷。所以，這個問題不單是你一個人的而且整個的社會問題；所以你個人問題的解决，同時亦卽社會問題的解决。所以我們爲着解决貧困問題，不應當斤斤於謀找好職業，却應當在大家求經濟解放的奮鬥的旗幟下，以共同的力量去謀得澈底解决。</p>
<p>我們努力的目標固應如此，但是我們究竟應當如何做去呢？編者以爲，我們的努力應當是一方面極力充實我們的學識，認識現社會紛辭的病源，同時更要推動這個改革病源的奮鬥。爲着澈底的經濟解放，固然非如此不可。但是我們却也不能完全放棄在現狀下的改良經濟舉動，我們也應當盡力在困苦艱難的生活中掙扎。因此，我們在可能範圍内，需學習些工作技能，使我們的職業有着落，謀業較爲便利些；而且，工作技能，在社會制席改革後的建設階段中，也是非常需要的。但我們所努力的經濟解放，却不是貪圖物質上的享受。所以我希望你對於目前的貧困，雖不要你「知足常樂」却也不宜過分爲這個問題煩擾，天天想着用各種方法去增加以入。至於你所欠的債務，在你這種「自顧不暇」的時候，儘可欠着不還，實際上你想還亦無還的能力，所以你不必爲着這種問題賣去無謂腦力也。　　編者</p>

<p>太太一聽最後這一句話，心裏有點怕，眼睛瞠着釘住六老爺說，「送官不好嗎？」</p>
<p>「要化錢不行！也不能够消我心頭之恨！」</p>
<p>太太是「三從四德」的名門淑女，對谥六爺是絕對服從的，並不敢多說話，何况爭辯呢？六爺下命令似地又說。</p>

<p>太太學得頭在發暈尺房子裏頭的東西在轉動，地下也在旋轉，太太暈倒床上去了。丫頭看爺到書齋去了，到門口張望，太太倒在床上並不和平時一樣忙上前推醒輕聲地呌。太太醒轉過來了，坐起身看是丫頭，呌倒茶來。丫頭在桌子上拿了茶壺就向廚房去泡開水，心裏想着，太太是受了六爺的氣了，脚下走快些。丫頭倒茶，太太問說。</p>
<p>「大少爺吃飯沒有？」</p>
<p>丫頭回說，「少奶奶送去了。少奶奶買酒給大少爺吃呢！」</p>
<p>唔！」太太點了頭伸手拿了茶杯，但是並不立刻喝茶，只在呆着。丫頭不敢出聲，站在旁邊。</p>
<p>「現在幾點鐘？」</p>
<p>「八點了呢。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Envoy's Visit to President Wang: Wang States Arita Came to Bid Farewell; No Concrete Negotiations Conducted; Arita Strived for Peace and Amity; Believes the North China Issue is a Local Incident <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Akira Arita arrived in Nanjing on the 18th morning with Han Wen Counselor Yano and Secretary Yokokawa. He immediately went to the Japanese Consulate General to rest. Someone met Arita at the station and inquired about everything. Arita, not fluent in Chinese, sent Yano to respond, stating that he came to bid farewell and had no other mission. He is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the evening of the 19th and return to his country at the end of the month, but the date has not yet been determined. The ambassador met Chairman Huang in Shanghai and made some inquiries about the North China issue, but there was no concrete discussion. This visit to Wang may involve some talk in passing, but it is not in the nature of formal negotiations. Regarding the North China war zone issue, the ambassador believes it is a local incident that should be resolved through close consultation between the relevant officials of both sides to avoid unnecessary complications. As for Japan's demand for through traffic and postal services, it is a de facto requirement, and there was already an understanding between China and Japan during the Tanggu Truce. Whether this issue will lead to further deterioration will depend on China's attitude. At 4:00 PM, Arita, accompanied by Counselor Yano, went to the official residence No. 1 of the Ministry of Railways in Sa Jia Wan to visit President Wang. Wang, accompanied by Huang Chao-chin, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, received them. In addition to bidding farewell, Arita also talked about ways to promote peace, amity, and progress between China and Japan. Wang also gave a detailed reply. They did not leave the consulate until 5:50 PM. According to Wang's written reply to reporters, Arita came to bid farewell, and there were no concrete negotiations. He solemnly declared his efforts to promote peace and amity between the two countries. Upon returning to his country, he will report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and seek further progress. The gist of my reply is that the Northeast issue has not yet been resolved, which is a stumbling block to peace and amity between the two countries. However, during the Fujian incident, the Japanese government expressed a solemn neutral attitude and did not interfere in China's internal affairs. This is beneficial to the understanding between the people of the two countries. At 8:00 PM, Wang hosted a banquet at his official residence to bid farewell to Arita, and invited the heads of various departments to accompany him. The banquet was just a simple meal, and it ended at 10:00 PM. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

President Wang received him, and Huang Chao-chin of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs served as the interpreter. Arita talked with Wang until about 5:00 PM before leaving. According to a Central News Agency reporter, Arita's visit to Wang was solely to bid farewell, and there were no concrete negotiations. However, he solemnly declared his desire to promote peace and amity between the two countries. Upon returning to his country, he will report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and seek further progress. Wang replied that the Northeast issue has not yet been resolved, which is a stumbling block to peace and amity between the two countries. However, during the Fujian incident, the Japanese government expressed a solemn neutral attitude and did not interfere in China's internal affairs. This is beneficial to the understanding between the people of the two countries. Furthermore, Wang hosted a banquet for Arita at the Ministry of Railways on the evening of the 18th.

<p>The current situation in Khalkha Tibet remains extremely chaotic. It is reported that the power struggle between the lama and secular factions in the government is intensifying, with the lama faction currently dominating. Lhasa appears peaceful on the surface. It is reported that Tibetans who welcome the restoration of Chinese sovereignty over Tibet account for at least 50%. If the Panchen Lama can return to Tibet, the Tibetans will no longer oppose China's restoration of its previous authority over Tibet. It is widely believed that the Panchen Lama will not rashly return to Tibet unless he and his followers are given adequate protection. The extent of the negotiations between Lhasa and Nanjing is currently unknown. At the same time, it is reported that Tibetan troops are advancing towards eastern Tibet, and it is expected that troublemakers in the area will rise in rebellion. If the Panchen Lama returns to his hometown, it may have a far-reaching impact, and Nanjing's desire to consolidate its power in Tibet will be more likely to succeed. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Bandit Liu Flees to the Northeast of Juxian County – Attempting to Rely on Dangerous Terrain to Resist Stubbornly – Han Orders Troops to Encircle from All Sides – Attack Within a Time Limit to Ensure Annihilation <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) The two groups of Liu's bandits have merged, numbering no more than 300. This morning, they fled from Han Wang in Juxian County, first southwest, then southeast, entering Rizhao County, then turning southwest and entering Juxian County. At 4:00 PM this afternoon, they reached Shichang, 70 li northeast of Juxian County. That place is in the midst of Wan Mountain, an extremely dangerous area. The bandits are thinking of relying on the terrain to resist. Han ordered the troops to encircle them tonight and attack at 6:00 AM tomorrow morning to annihilate them in one fell swoop. Zhan Shutang, commander of the 81st Division, is responsible for the southern front; Gao Lantian and Liu Yurong's two regiments are responsible for the western front; Kang Zhankui's regiment is responsible for the eastern front; Ma Guanyi's brigade is responsible for the northeastern front; Xu Wenyao's unit is responsible for the northern front. Captured bandits confessed that Liu's troops consist of four regiments, two of which he leads himself, and two of which are led by his younger brother, Liu Mao-donkey. The bandits have one man and two horses, taking turns riding. When they first entered Shandong, the Henan bandit leader Cui Bangjie was still with them, but he has now escaped. Liu has not been seen since the attack on the Wulian Mountain in Zhucheng. There is talk of him being killed in action. Liu wanted to break away, but was monitored by his subordinates and could not do so. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Two central aircraft flew to Wei this morning and set off with Shandong aircraft to bomb Liu's bandits in Xiahezhuang Liucun, southwest of Zhucheng, and Shimen Hujiazhuang, northwest of Juxian County. According to surrendered bandits, when Liu Guitang was running around on horseback the day before yesterday, our plane dropped a bomb, which landed right next to him. Liu was shocked and fell off his horse at the time, and is thought to have been injured. Many bandits are now leaving Liu and fleeing. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) At 3:00 AM on the 17th, several groups of Liu's bandits, numbering about 700 to 800, attempted to flee to Yishui via Wenquan, 70 li southwest of Anqiu, and clashed with the Tian Haizhong regiment of the encircling army. After fierce fighting until 6:00 AM, 70 to 80 bandits were killed, more than 100 were captured, and more than 100 donkeys, mules, and horses, more than 20 rifles, 3 machine guns, and 1 mortar were seized. The bandits split into two groups, a small group fleeing towards Yishui, with about 100 horses, and a large group heading southeast to Jinjiwo, 60 li southwest of Anqiu City, where they were met with a head-on attack by the Gao Lantian regiment, capturing more than 100 people, seizing more than 40 rifles, 2 hand-held machine guns, 4 Czech rifles, 1 82mm mortar, and an official seal, with the inscription "Commander's Seal of the People's Self-Defense Army". They then fled east to Qishan, where they were ambushed by the Tang Bangzhi brigade and the Wu Yuanxing regiment, which had been lying in wait there. The ferocity of the battle was unprecedented since Liu's bandits entered Shandong. Dead bandits and mules and horses were everywhere within three li. As many as 290 bandits were captured, including one regimental commander, one artillery battalion commander, and one guard battalion commander, seizing 180 to 190 horses, more than 200 rifles, and countless muskets and miscellaneous guns, and one 82mm mortar. At this point, the bandits were left with less than 300 people, scattered everywhere. One group, with fewer than 200 horses, fled back to Jinjiwo, and then fled east again from Jinjiwo. At 6:00 PM, they reached Wangjiadian, 30 li west of Zhucheng. The Zhucheng garrison and the militia are scheduled to attack tonight. A group of 70 to 80 horses was discovered near Jiayue, 60 li northwest of Zhucheng. This is probably the group that fled to Yishui, which then fled east to that place. Li Xiangchen's brigade from Juxian County is attacking them from the north. In summary, the remaining bandits number less than 300, and they can be eliminated within days. Han ordered planes to drop leaflets, promising amnesty to those who surrender their weapons. Many people are now surrendering their weapons with the leaflets. The bandits are exhausted. The banknotes they carry are soaked with sweat. Hundreds of captured bandits will be transported to Ji'nan within days. Because the bandits have been largely resolved, Han has ordered Tang Bangzhi and Wu Yuanxing's units, Ma Guanyi's brigade, Tian Haizhong's regiment, etc. to pursue them, while the rest have returned to their original defenses. Yun Qichang's brigade and the pistol brigade have now returned to Ji'nan. (17th Special Dispatch) (Late Arrival)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Heng on the Issue of Through Traffic and Postal Services in North China <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Since the issue of through traffic and postal services arose in North China, the central government has repeatedly stated that there have been no such negotiations. However, recently, during the Nanchang Conference, it was widely rumored that the Japanese side was exerting great pressure on us to resolve the issue of through traffic and postal services. Therefore, the citizens who are concerned about the current situation have paid great attention to President Wang of the Executive Yuan's trip to Jiangxi and return to Beijing, and Chairman Huang of the Political Affairs Committee's departure from Jiangxi to Shanghai. Even more attention was paid to Huang's meeting with Japanese Ambassador Arita. However, according to news reports, after President Wang returned to Beijing, he firmly denied the matter to those who inquired. According to a certain important person's conversation, he also denied discussing the issue of through traffic and postal services. After Chairman Huang arrived in Shanghai, he reported the situation in North China to reporters, saying that Japan has not recently made any major demands in fact, but there are many small demands. In our observation, the issue of through traffic and postal services is of great importance and cannot be regarded as a small demand. Therefore, it can be known that what Chairman Huang called small demands does not refer to this issue. After Huang met with Arita, Arita told Japanese reporters that China needs to give twelve minutes of consideration to the implementation and resolution of issues such as through traffic and postal services. From all of this, it can be known that the rumors circulating outside today about how urgent the issue of through traffic and postal services is and how it has been resolved are all talks of oversensitivity or one-sided and excessive exaggeration.</p>
<p>Is there no reason why the central government must give twelve minutes of serious consideration? On the surface, this issue of through traffic and postal services seems to be a matter of one part, but in reality, it is related to the issue of sovereignty over the Northeast. In terms of international law, a country that conducts commercial and economic negotiations with a new country and concludes a treaty with it is recognizing this new country in fact. If one's own sovereignty does not extend to this country, and one negotiates or concludes a treaty with another country regarding this country, then in fact the other country is the suzerain state of this country. Today, the issue of through traffic and postal services between North China and the puppet state cannot be resolved through negotiations with the other party. If negotiations are held, whether the other party is the puppet state or Japan, it is enough to constitute suspicion that our country is giving up sovereignty over the Northeast. If the other party is the puppet state, engaging in negotiations is tantamount to recognizing its qualifications for independence. If the other party is Japan, it is also tantamount to recognizing the puppet state as a protectorate of Japan. Neither of these is acceptable.</p>
<p>Moreover, the unacceptability of the puppet state and the illegality of Japan's creation of a puppet are not only the unanimous feelings of our people, but also have been expressed in repeated resolutions by the League of Nations. Since Japan decided to withdraw from the League of Nations, the League of Nations was deeply concerned that two countries would be colluding with Japan to carry out separate recognition of the puppet state. Therefore, on June 7th of last year, it specifically passed effective measures to not recognize the puppet state, and specifically stipulated that "Member States should avoid actions that may be regarded as explicitly or tacitly recognizing the government of the puppet state." Our country should, of course, avoid the suspicion of violating this resolution first, not to mention it.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if we are unfortunately forced by Japan's strong force to resolve it, the result will inevitably be that the rights granted to China by the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact will all be lost. The integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty is stipulated by the Nine-Power Treaty, and the situation created by force is strictly condemned by the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Since the September 18th Incident, these treaties have not been effective, but it cannot be said that it is not thanks to these treaties that the great powers have not blatantly followed in Japan's footsteps and recognized the puppet organization. If our country inadvertently becomes a de facto recognition of the puppet state due to the issue of through traffic and postal services, what words will our country have once other countries use this as an excuse to rise up and recognize it?</p>
<p>Or someone may think that the current international situation is already favorable to Japan. If we firmly reject negotiations on through traffic and postal services, it will inevitably cause the situation to move towards a dangerous situation. Not only will we not gain long-term benefits, but we may also immediately suffer short-term disasters. However, in our observation, the international situation may not be favorable to Japan. Taking the recognition of the puppet state as an example, France's investment in the puppet state has been rumored for a long time, but there has been no action to date. Germany's recognition of the puppet state has also been said definitively, but the German authorities have since firmly denied it. After the exchange of notes between Japan and the United States, the United States seems to have the possibility of recognizing the puppet state, but the US authorities have clearly stated that this is out of the question. Until recently, there have been rumors of a revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance by the Japanese side, but it is far from the truth. All of these rumors, when they arise, are always colorful and vivid. After a little time passes, it can be proven where the facts lie. One does not need to be discerning to know where the rumors come from. Can we today be confused by the talk of the international situation and shake our firm stance?</p>

<p>(Nanjing) This morning, the National Government held a memorial ceremony in Nanjing for the 7th anniversary of the establishment of the capital. Attendees included Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Chu Minyi, Kong Xiangxi, Chen Lifu, Deng Jiayan, Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, Wang Shijie, Chen Qicai, Cao Haosen, Chen Ce, Huang Musong, Lin Xiang, Li Chao, Wei Huai, and approximately six hundred civil and military officials from various departments and ministries.

Today's memorial commemorates the past, in which the government strived against the environment amidst turmoil, and managed to consolidate the foundation of the Republic, leaving behind a lasting legacy. Under the leadership of Chairman Lin, we should engage in national salvation efforts, striving in the spiritual realm to improve people's hearts and the ways of the world, and fully form a strong physique. Public officials should take Chairman Lin as a model, while also serving as a model for the people. Today's memorial is a call to strive in the spiritual realm, hoping to create a foundation for the Republic of China that lasts for thousands of generations. The ceremony concluded at 10:30 AM.

<p>(Nanjing) Anti-Chinese sentiment remains fierce in Mexico. A letter from overseas Chinese states that in Yanxianada, a port city in a Mexican state, there is an anti-Chinese party called the "National Preservation and Salvation Association" whose main objective is to expel overseas Chinese. Recently, they have been distributing leaflets and boycotting overseas Chinese, implementing their expulsion. Their speeches everywhere are filled with insults and the slogan shouted is "Expel overseas Chinese!" They use cloth banners with the words "Expel Chinese, Implement Boycott." On March 4th, the situation was the same as described above, with a surging momentum, treating Chinese as enemies. On the morning of the 5th, several leaders directed party members, with party badges sewn on their left sleeves, to stand guard, two at each Chinese store, preventing Mexicans from entering to buy goods. Local police have no authority to intervene, and complaints to local officials are ignored. Several letters and telegrams were sent last week to our country's minister in Mexico, requesting him to make serious representations to Mexico to stop the boycott. However, after several days, there has been no instruction from Minister Huang, and everyone is panicking, in imminent danger. They have no choice but to respectfully report this perilous situation, hoping that with the sympathy of our common race, they can appeal to the government to quickly find a way to negotiate and resolve the crisis.

<p>Riga: Should Soviet Russia resume war, it will be able to expand its standing army with the elite of its territorial army. Today, according to news from Moscow, within the next three months, Soviet Russia will compile and train 300,000 new territorial soldiers, and give them particularly strict training, commanded by standing army officers. It is heard that the Labor Party Bureau has already informed various labor unions, ordering them to assist in the establishment of the new army. Now, special attention will be paid to training specialized riflemen, therefore it has ordered labor unions to select two percent of their members to join the Voroshilov Rifle Team. Voroshilov is the current military commissioner, hence the new team is named after him. The compilation and training of this army is to assist the Red Army, and it is hoped that each person can be trained to be a skilled rifleman. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The French government's note explaining the guarantee issue was delivered to the British government this afternoon. According to general information, the note advocates "maintaining the current state of armaments in various countries" as the basis for concluding a disarmament convention. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today it was learned that the recent note from the French government to Britain effectively declares that disarmament negotiations cannot proceed. The French note declares that Germany's determination to restore its armaments has made a disarmament convention impossible to complete. The note further specifically raises two points to strengthen its argument: one is that Germany has increased its military budget by 2,000,000,000 francs, and the other is that Germany's reply to Britain's inquiry about the reason for its increased military spending shows a disregard for consequences and a determination to go its own way. The French note concludes by expressing its readiness to submit the issue of German rearmament to the Disarmament General Commission, which will be held in Geneva on May 23. (National Telegram, 17th)　　(London) According to the Daily News, the French government's note to Britain suggests concluding a British-French military agreement, stating that if Germany violates the disarmament convention, Britain will unite with France to implement military sanctions.

<p>Regarding the issue of implementing safeguards, the French government gave an oral reply to the British government on April 6th, and later prepared a formal document, clearly stating France's views. This document, totaling three pages, was delivered to the British government this afternoon. The document stated that the French government greatly admires the British government's emphasis on safeguards for the implementation of the disarmament convention, but Germany's violation of the peace treaty and implementation of rearmament, if clearly stipulated in the disarmament convention, would be tantamount to legally recognizing Germany's violation of the treaty, which France cannot endorse. Although the French government supports the conclusion of a disarmament convention, since Germany increased its military expenditures and explained the reasons for its increase to Britain, the French government cannot but change its initial intentions. Germany's huge expenditures on military affairs are openly announced, showing its intention to disregard all existing treaties and proceed with rearmament. Moreover, various countries are currently conducting talks on the disarmament issue, which have not yet concluded, and Germany is acting publicly without waiting for the results of the talks. Under such circumstances, France cannot but safeguard its security. The current bilateral negotiations on the disarmament issue can be said to have yielded no results, and the Disarmament Conference General Committee must re-discuss them in the hope of achieving better results. France has always insisted on the League of Nations as the final destination, hoping that the British representative can assist France in the General Committee so that a disarmament convention can be established under general security conditions. French Foreign Minister Barthou will attend the Disarmament Conference General Committee meeting on May 23, and Mr. Barthou will also participate in the League of Nations Administrative Council's discussion of the Saar plebiscite on May 14. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday, the French cabinet approved the note to Britain, rejecting the British disarmament plan. At that time, the army chief, navy chief, and air chief all took a firm stance, and the cabinet members in charge of the non-departmental portfolios, Taidieau and Helieau, also supported it. It is noted that the note that France sent to Britain on April 6 regarding the issue of safeguards only made tentative suggestions on this matter, but since Germany replied to Britain's inquiry about the reasons for increasing military expenditures, all hopes for continued negotiations have been dashed. France views Germany's reply as a blatant admission that Germany has re-established its armaments, and Germany intends to continue adding to its armaments in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, discussing the issue of safeguards today is of no use. Any suggestion that recognizes Germany's actions as legitimate will inevitably stir up a storm throughout France. It is also believed that the French note called on Britain to pay attention to the danger of aerial bombardment. French newspapers all say that if the British were in the position of the French, they would do the same as France. Many people here now believe that the cautious estimate of the surplus for next year in British Chancellor Chamberlain's budget speech yesterday is due to the fear that once the disarmament plan breaks down, military spending will increase.

Belgium signed a common disarmament plan with the aforementioned five countries, as well as Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands, on July 13, 1932, which was a minimum and could be implemented immediately. This time, the memorandum submitted by the five countries was not signed, because Belgium's most pressing concern at the moment is to obtain supplementary guarantees in terms of security. Therefore, it is waiting for the results of the British-French negotiations. However, Belgium believes that the memorandum submitted by the five countries is in line with Belgium's policy.

<p>Madrid: It is rumored that Trotsky, the leader of the Soviet anti-gang, will come to live in Spain after being expelled from France.

(Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Trotsky, who was once the military leader of all of Russia, is now like a frightened bird in France, planning to leave Paris today. However, even Trotsky himself does not know where his paradise will be. The French government has heard that Trotsky is promoting his doctrine near Babisang, so it is not allowed to stay in France, so Mr. Trotsky now has to leave here. Mr. Trotsky lived in Babisang for seven months, and in addition to his wife, there were also three secretaries. Mr. Trotsky is now planning to go to another place secretly, only wanting to tell his address to his family and close friends. The French government is willing to guarantee his safe exit, but there are many White Russians who want to assassinate Trotsky, and they are all sworn to resist the communists. At the same time, the police are also paying special attention to the White Russians in Paris, Babisang and Fontenbleau, because the government wants Mr. Trotsky to leave safely. Since the madman stabbed President Doumer to death in Glov, the White Russians have issued a declaration of respecting the law, but Mr. Trotsky is still wary of these exiled White Russians. Mr. Trotsky came to Paris before he became famous, and at that time he was poor and had no place to return to. Now, Mr. Trotsky must put a pistol under his pillow when he goes to bed.

<p>(Washington) The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chamberlain's, proposed budget, which expresses the country's recovery, has aroused a good impression in Washington. However, Secretary of State Hull told members of the press that he must formally ascertain what Britain's intentions are regarding the war debt owed to the United States, which is due on June 15th of the next term, before he can comment. Representatives of the Treasury Department are also silent about the British budget, and it is expected that the United States will have many criticisms, because the case does not list foreign debt payments. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) British Chancellor Chamberlain presented his third budget in the House of Commons this afternoon, and explained it. It took one hour and thirty-six minutes to complete. When he sat down, cheers erupted from all parties in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>The price of tax cuts: Chamberlain said that the cost of reducing the income tax from five shillings to four shillings and six pence will be £20,500,000 this year. If calculated on a full-year basis, it will be £24,000,000. He estimated that the surplus based on the new tax rate would be approximately £800,000.</p>
<p>The Chancellor mentioned the automobile industry, saying that among all the industries, it is almost unsurpassed in its ability to expand. The output of automobiles has increased in recent years, but as far as he knows, the private export trade of automobiles cannot maintain its original activity. British automobile manufacturers now feel that foreign automobile competition overseas is fierce and difficult to cope with, because the horsepower of foreign automobiles, compared to the size and weight of their bodies, actually exceeds British automobiles. If the British car horsepower tax is not slightly reduced, there is no way to help the expansion of British car trade. Therefore, from January 1, 1935, the British car horsepower tax will be reduced from one pound to fifteen shillings, and there will be an equivalent reduction in the horsepower of motor bicycles.</p>
<p>Allocation of surplus: The Chancellor spoke of the allocation of the £31 million surplus, saying that he had considered this matter again and again. He knew that many people in the country also paid a great deal of attention to this matter. His actions on this matter are based on two principles. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden said that in all fairness, the surplus must be used to relieve the class that suffered the most during times of panic. This statement is most applicable. The previous government believed that the reduction in salaries and tax increases were temporary measures to cope with the temporary emergency, and the people responded to them in this spirit. Now, the financial resources he has are not enough to fully restore the salaries that have been reduced, so half of the amount reduced in 1931 will be restored from July 1 of this year. This is the first principle. Since the existing financial resources are not enough to restore full salaries, they should be distributed fairly among two types of people: taxpayers and those whose salaries have been reduced. It is now proposed to allocate it according to the amount of their contribution. It is estimated that £4 million is needed to restore unemployment benefits, and £3.6 million is also needed to restore half of the reduced salaries.</p>
<p>Criticism from all sides: There was a slight debate in the House of Commons. All parties congratulated the Chancellor for explaining the budget clearly and systematically, but there were also some who expressed dissatisfaction. Labor MP Atlee said that he would very much like to congratulate the Chancellor, but he felt that this was the most despicable thing on record. The relief that Chamberlain gave to the unemployed was no more than what he gave to those who ride motor cars. It is worthy of criticism that it is heavier on the latter than on the former. Liberal leader Samuel said that what has been reduced in the past should be fully restored. Independent Labor Party leader Maxton said that he could congratulate the Chancellor and had nothing to criticize, because he did not come here hoping that the capitalist national government would give anything. Conservative MP McGuiness said that the British brewing industry is now in decline, only one-third of what it was before the war, and the budget has no remedies for it, which is regrettable.

<p>(Moscow) President Roosevelt recently signed the Johnson Act, which prohibits lending money to countries that owe the United States debts, and stipulates that the authorities should supervise foreign fundraising in the United States. As a result, a large number of goods that Soviet Russia had previously planned to order from the United States may be ordered from Britain and other parts of the British Empire. According to the US government, it lent money to Russia in 1917 when Kerensky was in power in Russia, but it was later denied by the Soviet Russian government. The Soviet Russian Commercial Daily today advised domestic economic groups to retaliate against the US Johnson Act, and that all equipment needed for the Second Five-Year Plan must no longer give priority to the use of American materials. The newspaper also warned the Soviet Russian government not to be forced to make any debt settlements with the United States. It is noted that the British and Russian governments established a trade agreement between the two countries several months ago, defining each other's commercial relations. Therefore, if the goods that Soviet Russia plans to order from the United States are purchased from other countries, Britain will of course be able to share a large part of the profits, especially machinery.

<p>(New York) After President Roosevelt announced his plan for submitting bills to this Congress on April 16, a difficult situation has arisen. The advisory committee that President Roosevelt established to investigate the National Recovery Administration has issued its opinion, criticizing the Recovery Administration in many ways. The committee, chaired by the famous American lawyer Daros, is said to have found a monopolistic trend in the industry rules under the control of General Johnson, the director of the Recovery Administration, which hinders small industries. Therefore, the President seems to be in a violent conflict on both sides. Progressive elements inside and outside Congress have expressed dissatisfaction with the authorities' weakness towards big industry and finance, and advocate various progressive expansion plans. However, big business and finance are gradually feeling that the time has come to openly resist the continued progress of the "New Deal." They are eager to reap the benefits of commercial recovery without being subject to the restrictions that President Roosevelt wants to impose on them. The shelving of the amendment that would render the Securities Exchange Management Act useless, the proposal of the Wagner Act to establish a permanent airmail service, the regulations on the relationship between employers and organized labor, and the recent development of the National Recovery Administration's policies can all be regarded as a shift to the right. Even those who strongly support President Roosevelt are uneasy about this situation. According to the opinions of the President's friends, the amendment to the Securities Exchange Management Act contains opposition to the "New Deal." If the President makes every effort to resist this opposition force, it will be the best way to restore his trust as the head of state. It is believed that the struggle with Wall Street on this issue will be enough to arouse public support and restore President Roosevelt's prestige in Congress, because members of Congress are now gradually breaking away from the President.

<p>(Washington) Congress's actions on the Penhhead Bill, which is to enforce control over American cotton, were completed today.</p>
<p>This case has now been sent to the White House for President Roosevelt's approval. After the case is approved, American cotton farmers will be forced to reduce the planting of cotton, limited to 10 million bales in 1934, in order to raise cotton prices. It is noted that the original Penhhead case was passed by the House of Representatives on March 19 and sent to the Senate, but the Senate Republican spokesman strongly opposed it, saying that the passage of this case would cause a revolution in the South. However, on March 29, the Senate finally amended it and passed it with 46 votes to 39, and then sent it back to the House of Representatives for review. The amendment stipulated that cotton produced in excess of the 10 million bale limit would be taxed at 75% of the market price, instead of 50%, and stipulated that each cotton farmer would have six bales of tax-free cotton. However, at a joint meeting of the two houses on April 13, it was decided to delete the six bales of tax-free cotton, and it was decided that excess cotton would be taxed at 50% of the market price when sold, and the effective period of this case was limited to one year.

<p>(Washington) Today, the State Department received a notice from Spain approving the London Silver Agreement. Among the signatory countries, only Peru has not approved the agreement. Other important countries, such as the United States, Britain, China, Australia, India, Mexico, and Spain, have all approved the agreement, which has now come into effect. The Silver Agreement was established at the London Economic Conference last year. Spain's approval of the agreement guarantees that it will no longer dump silver on the world market and agrees that its silver exports will not exceed the specified amount in the next four years. The agreement took effect on January 1, 1934. This agreement was initiated by the United States and unanimously accepted by 66 countries worldwide. Spain, China, and India, as silver-using countries, hold the most important positions. The United States, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Peru are the main silver-producing countries. As for Peru, nothing has been heard from it since last year. If the agreement is not approved by all signatory countries by April 1, 1934, it will not be effective for silver-using countries, but silver-producing countries will still be bound by it. If Peru can approve the agreement, it will be implemented immediately. Spain's formal approval of the Silver Agreement has given a significant boost to the silver faction in Congress. Although the silver faction members are opposed by the political reserve, they are still actively promoting it. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Hebei Provincial Governor received a telegram from Tangshan Mine Inspector Li Yinchun stating that around 7 PM on the 17th, two factions of workers, Group A and Group B, at the Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Mine had a labor dispute, resulting in a clash. The situation was quite serious at the time, with injuries on both sides. The mine area security team immediately intervened with force, and the situation calmed down slightly. The inspector, along with Tangshan Public Security Bureau Chief Zhao Xun, rushed to the mine area overnight to mediate. By 5 AM on the 18th, the misunderstanding had been resolved, and work was resumed. The Kailuan Mining Bureau received a report from the Tangjiazhuang Mine Office stating that at 7 PM on the 17th, some external workers suddenly went on strike. After mediation by both officials and the mine, work was resumed. The reason for the strike was a disagreement between the two factions of workers, which led to a fight, unrelated to the mine. On the 18th, representatives from the old Tangshan Mine Union, including Li and about ten others, came to Tianjin, separately visiting the Industry Department and the Kailuan Mining Bureau, requesting permission to restore the old union for legal activities. They were informed that the suspension of union activities was a central government order and difficult to overturn. The representatives, without result, intend to go to Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin) to petition the Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The preparatory committee for the National Financial Conference held its fourth meeting on the afternoon of the 18th, chaired by Gao Bingfang. (1) Revised and approved the conference rules of procedure and detailed rules of procedure. (2) The conference budget of 19,480 yuan, as finally approved, was passed. (3) The ministry was requested to consult with the provincial and municipal governments to nominate representatives to attend the conference and instruct the heads of the provincial finance departments and bureaus to come to Nanjing to attend the conference at the same time; this was passed. (4) Notification to the provinces and cities to submit reports and plans to the ministry ten days before the conference for review was passed. (5) Request to the ministry to order the heads of various tax bureaus under its jurisdiction to attend the conference at that time was passed. (6) The proposal to hire economic experts to attend the conference was passed. (7) It was decided to establish the secretariat on the 25th, which was passed. (8) The preparatory committee will continue to meet, which was passed.

As for the hired experts, including economic experts Ma Yinchu, Wei Tingsheng, Chen Changheng, and statistical experts, a total of 17 people will be issued letters of appointment separately within days. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi said that the main purpose of the financial conference is to prevent provincial and county budgets from being changed or abolished at any time for various reasons, and to abolish all kinds of excessive taxes and levies. Although financial reform is difficult due to long-standing problems, the Ministry of Finance must find ways to reduce the burden on the people within the possible scope. He advocated that each annual provincial budget must be approved by the central government, and the county budget must be approved by the provincial government. Expenditures on water conservancy and education cannot be reduced. If 80,000 security guards are to be organized, requiring an expenditure of 70,000 yuan, and if this 70,000 yuan includes a certain amount for publicity expenses and a certain amount for entertainment expenses, then these are unnecessary and can be reduced. If the budget is 10 million yuan and the actual expenditure on projects exceeds the budget, then the deficit will be allocated by the superior agency. In this way, the local income and expenditure, once approved, can never be misused. As for the land tax reform plan, it is still under investigation, and the implementation period will be after the financial conference is held. He consistently advocates increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Anything belonging to project expenses will not be refuted, otherwise, he will try his best to reduce it. The operating expenses of various agencies of the ministry have all been reduced. The expenses for this financial conference were initially budgeted at 50,000 yuan, but have been reduced to 19,480 yuan. As for tax revenue, the collection of customs duties, consolidated taxes, and special taxes has been good recently. The Currency System Reform Committee has, in fact, been established. The Ministry of Finance has a Financial Reform Committee, which also includes research on currency system reform matters. The Central Bank also has a Currency System Research Office. This time, in order to accommodate opinions from all parties, bankers were invited to participate and various research associations were merged. As for the expansion of the Central Mint, it has been decided to purchase new machinery on the one hand, improve facilities on the other hand, and increase the scope of minting. Whether Lu Xuepu resigned or not, Lu himself may have done so, but the ministry has not yet received his resignation. The review of the collection of anti-dumping taxes is nearing completion, and detailed measures are being drafted. In fact, it has been selectively implemented. For example, the import tax on foreign rice and wheat is a type of anti-dumping tax. In the future, it is also planned to collect taxes on the import of luxury goods after the review measures are decided. Finally, he said, (1) The Ministry of Finance has continued to allocate monthly relief funds to the disaster areas of North China since the cessation of hostilities. Even after the cessation of hostilities in the campaign against Sun Dianying, funds have been allocated for relief. (2) The financial difficulties in North China are indeed certain. However, not only North China is like this; the United States also has a large number of unemployed workers, and France's recent salary reduction problem is due to financial difficulties. (3) The silver company organized by Song Weiyuan, etc., has a capital of 10 million yuan. Preparations are ready, and registration procedures are being carried out with the competent ministries. It is rumored that the company is developing the Northwest, but this is not accurate. The model large-scale ceramic company initiated by him in Jiangxi is now being prepared in Jiangxi by Du Chongyuan, who has extensive experience in managing the ceramic industry in Shenyang. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to reduce the additional land tax and abolish excessive taxes and levies, the Ministry of Finance has decided to hold a financial conference in Beijing on May 21. The ministry issued orders to the financial authorities of the provinces, cities, and bureaus on the 18th, as well as representatives of the economic sector, to attend the meeting in Beijing at that time, and to submit all reports and plans to the ministry ten days before the meeting. The conference preparatory committee has also basically completed preparations. The last preparatory committee meeting was held at 2 PM on the 18th, and the conference regulations and rules of procedure were passed. The preparatory committee was dissolved, and it was decided to establish the secretariat of the financial conference next Wednesday to handle the affairs of the conference.

<h3 id="e49">Shanghai Cloth Exchange Refuses to Accept New Yarn - Mu Ouchu and Others File a Petition - The Ministry of Industry's Reply Rejects it <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Mu Ouchu, chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Cloth Exchange, and others, expressed disagreement with the Cotton Control Committee of the Economic Commission's order to refuse to accept new yarn and stabilize yarn prices and filed a petition with the Ministry of Industry. The ministry has replied and sent a copy of the litigation decision to reject it, stating that stabilizing yarn prices is one of the methods to treat the symptoms of the cotton industry. The main reason for the recent drop in yarn prices is that the exchange has too much inventory and the quality is low. This is evidenced by the facts since the implementation of the refusal to accept new yarn, such as the increase in yarn prices, the stabilization of people's minds, and the increase in sales. Furthermore, the government's adoption of a control policy for the cotton industry is to seek to use the power of the country to assist the development of the national yarn industry. It should take the interests of the majority as the premise. This time, ordering the exchange to refuse to accept new yarn in order to stabilize yarn prices is based on this purpose. If it is allowed to take its course naturally without restrictions, the yarn price will inevitably continue to fall, and its harm to public interests will be not small. Based on the above judgment, the ministry, according to the Cotton Control Committee, also requested that the exchange be ordered to comply. It is just and reasonable in law and sentiment. The reasons given by the petitioners are difficult to establish. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Datong was the former capital of the Northern Wei Tuoba Gui, known as Xijing during the Liao and Jin dynasties. It was formerly a prefecture during the Qing dynasty and is now a county under Shanxi province. The city is located north of the confluence of the Xiaohua River and the Yu River, with high and large walls. The north and south gates each have two earthen fortresses, forming a magnificent scene. It is popularly known as the Phoenix City. Located between the inner and outer Great Walls, it is a transportation hub at the center of the Ping-Sui Railway and the starting point of the highway connecting northern Shanxi directly to southern Shanxi, making it an important town in the north, both ancient and modern. The entire county has a population of 290,000, with 50,000 residing in the city. Commerce and industry are flourishing, and it has long been the second largest city in Shanxi province. In 1920, battles occurred, raising 2 million yuan in war expenses. This was followed by a sharp drop in the value of banknotes issued by the Shanxi Provincial Bank, with 20 yuan only exchanging for 1 silver dollar. The people suffered greatly and have not yet recovered. The bank has now issued new currency, with relatively good credit. Most residents are farmers, with meager fertilization. The fields are mostly mixed with sand and gravel, with high winds and early frost. Wheat and beans are planted around the Qingming Festival, followed by millet, corn, sorghum, and oats two or three months later. In a good year, the yield is less than one bushel per mu, so people only eat twice a day. Farmers who cultivate land outside the border also engage in animal husbandry, going out in the spring and returning in the winter, like migrating geese. Most are not natives and live in earthen caves to shelter from the wind and rain. Recently, many have rebuilt flat houses, gradually forming villages.</p>
<p>The products are abundant and the prices are low. Rice is 17 catties per yuan (Saigon rice is only 7 catties per yuan, and it is mostly used in restaurants and banquets), fine flour is 19 catties per yuan, mixed flour is 22 catties per yuan (the following are all per yuan), millet is 35 catties, oat flour is 44 catties, Tianjin salt is more than 6 catties, Sui salt (of inferior quality to Tianjin salt) is 15 catties, pork is 7 catties, beef and mutton are 8 catties, sesame oil is 4 catties, kerosene is 6 catties, cotton is 2 catties, and coal is 450 catties (produced in Kouquan, of excellent quality, with no foul odor, and leaving ash like charcoal after burning; nearby villagers transport it from the mines, and can get 1,000 catties per yuan). During the years 1929-1930, prices were about four times higher, but it was easier to make a living and people could barely afford food and clothing. Although prices are now low, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Farmers toil tirelessly, and businesses operate from dawn to dusk, yet it is difficult to make a living. The state of depression and misery can be seen everywhere in the city and countryside.</p>
<p>The schools include the provincial Third Middle School, Third Normal School, and Fifth Women's Normal School. There is also a county-run Rural Normal School and 500 elementary schools in various districts and villages. In addition, there are three or four church-run primary and secondary schools. Teachers' salaries are 60 yuan or more per month for middle schools, while elementary schools are divided into five grades (A, B, C, D, and E) based on the size of the village. Grade A teachers receive only 10 yuan per month, decreasing to 6 yuan for lower grades. Teachers must be assessed according to regulations. Before school starts on the 20th day of the lunar New Year, the county government informs the villages to hire teachers according to grade. For example, a Grade C school must hire a Grade C teacher; hiring Grade A or B teachers is allowed, but hiring Grade D or E teachers is not. If teachers are not hired by the deadline, the county government and the Education Bureau will directly appoint teachers according to their assessment rankings. However, the villagers often claim that they cannot afford food and clothing and have no ability to support education. They bitterly plead for a postponement. This is what the county government reports. According to Gong Zideng of the public library, the schools fail to open not only due to economic difficulties, but also because of a lack of faith in the new education system. The majority of villagers still yearn for the "Three Hundred, One Thousand, One Thousand." The "Three Hundred, One Thousand, One Thousand" refers to the Three Character Classic, the Hundred Family Surnames, the Thousand Character Classic, and the Thousand Poems. Currently, most family instructions or private schools in the villages secretly pass on these "Three Hundred, One Thousand, One Thousand" as their legacy. Education will not achieve "universal" success until these "Three Hundred, One Thousand, One Thousand" are overthrown. In the county government, I heard that people were fond of endless litigation over trivial matters. Leaving the county government, I saw several people rolling up their sleeves and cursing at each other, about to fight. Entering a restaurant, I saw that most of the diners were wearing fur coats and exposing their chests, leaning on the table with their left arms and placing their right feet on the stools, cursing and shouting with a fierce attitude. It is difficult to approach them. The ancient customs of You and Bing were fond of bravery and chivalry. Is it because of the harsh climate? Or is it because the people are accustomed to military affairs due to the dangerous terrain and the use of force in the north? However, such customs have deteriorated to this point, and it seems that it is necessary to rise up and correct them.</p>
<p>In the south street of the city, there is a so-called "Lively Land," which is said to be the headquarters for selling "official opium." The method is to divide the entire city into four districts, each with a daily sales limit of at least 25 taels of opium, priced at about 2.5 yuan per tael. Although there are laws and regulations restricting it, the quality is not as good as private opium, so most addicts still secretly buy private goods for mixing. As a result, private opium sales are always better than official opium. I once visited the Yungang Great Buddha Temple and hired a horse-drawn sedan for transportation. The monks offered a meal, and the coachman asked for money for "foreign cigarettes." I scolded him for being unreasonable, but he asked me to lend it to him temporarily. To what extent has this private opium evil reached? One can easily imagine the whole picture based on this glimpse.</p>
<p>The Yungang Stone Buddhas are the largest structures in the Wuzhou Mountains of Datong and are a great achievement of ancient Eastern art. The project was started during the Later Wei Tuoba era and was repaired during the Liao, Jin, Ming, and Qing dynasties. In the 36th year of the Kangxi Emperor, an imperial inscription with the four characters "Solemn Buddha Image" was added. The temple is located more than 30 li west of Datong city. On the way, one passes Wangyun Temple, where the walls have collapsed and the Buddha statues are fully exposed. Fearing rain, the villagers moved them to the corner of the hall, where they were crowded and leaning, looking both ridiculous and pitiful. Ten li away is Guanyin Hall, a temple built on a slope with the road passing underneath, like a city gate. One side of the archway is inscribed "Luojia" and the other "Chao Yin." The screen wall in front of the gate is made of glazed tiles in a dragon playing with a pearl pattern, a lively scene similar to the "Nine Dragon Wall" in the city. The Datong Nine Dragon Stele (photo by Geng)</p>
<p>I heard that someone from a certain country once tried to buy the Nine Dragon Wall of the Forbidden City in Beijing for a large sum of money but failed, and then tried this one but stopped after realizing the difficulty. The nearby village is also called Guanyin Hall, and the people all live in earthen houses. The wells are as deep as seventeen or eighteen zhang, making it very difficult to draw water. Tourists and coal transporters often drink from them.</p>
<p>Another ten li or so is Yungang Fort (village name, about 20 households), with cliffs behind it. There are hundreds of stone caves, looking like kilns from a distance, seemingly unremarkable. However, upon closer inspection, each cave has a large stone Buddha standing majestically in the center. The cave walls and ceilings are covered with countless small Buddhas. Looking up and down, one cannot help but admire the ancients. This is the Great Buddha Temple, my destination. The temple gate faces south and is inscribed "Stone Buddha Ancient One of the Yungang Great Stone Buddhas (photo by Geng)"</p>
<p>Temple." Inside is the Guandi Hall, inscribed "Majestic Zhen Qiankun." Further inside is the main hall, four stories high, built against the cliff and carved into the stone Buddha. The five caves to the west of the hall are carved with Shakyamuni, Bhaisajyaguru, Amitabha, Manjushri, and Guanyin. The bare feet are two feet five inches long. From this, one can measure the greatness of the whole body and the other four large Buddhas in the caves. On the top wall of the third cave, there is a stone tablet inscribed "Northern Wei Taihe Seven Years," which is very valuable, but it is difficult to rub due to its high position. To the east of the hall is Amitabha Buddha, which is five zhang and two feet five inches high. The four characters "Solemn Buddha Image" are inscribed here. To the east and west are the Great Buddha Temple Main Hall (photo by Geng)</p>
<p>Buddha caves, extending for four or five li, all carved into a natural cliff. However, they have been eroded by wind and rain for a long time, and the deterioration is more severe than in the halls with buildings. However, this natural phenomenon of disappearance may be difficult for human effort to prevent. Most regrettably, the heads of many small Buddhas have been stolen and sold to someone from a certain country by ignorant villagers. Although they have been repaired with mud, they are not harmonious. And now the Buddha bodies and hall walls are covered with inscriptions by tourists, such as "So-and-so Girls' Normal School of So-and-so Province visited here in memory of Principal So-and-so in the Republic of China, year 22," either painted with ink or carved with knives, which is an eyesore and heartbreaking, and unworthy of the ancients.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Liu Guitang's Bandits Mostly Resolved, Each Army's Encirclement and Suppression at Qishan Successful, Tang Bangzhi Reports Many Bandits Killed <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Jinan correspondence: After Liu Guitang's bandits sneaked to the southwest of Anqiu city on the evening of the 16th, to the Shimen-Jia Meng Guan-Zhuang area in the southwest of Zhongmu, where Yishui and Linqu counties border, they were originally tending toward Yishui. But the bandit suppression army intercepted them, and they moved slightly northeast, stopping to lodge at Mu Ke, about 25 li south of Pingyuanzhen, 50 li southwest of Anqiu county city. Small bandits who had already dispersed were also gathering at that place, so the number of people had increased by about seven or eight hundred compared with when they had sneaked to the border with Yishui. The bandit suppression army's 22nd Division's Tian Haizhong Regiment, 20th Division's Wu Yuanxing Regiment, 81st Division's Tang Bangzhi Brigade, 74th Division's Ma Guanyi Brigade, 22nd Division's Xu Wenyao's directly subordinate division unit, and 29th Division's Li Xiangchen Brigade's Liu Regiment, 22nd Division's Li Zhanbiao Brigade, Zhang Derun's Handgun Brigade, 81st Division's directly subordinate division unit and Li Xuande's cavalry brigade, surrounded the bandit's location from four sides overnight. At about 5:00 AM this morning (the 17th), Tian Haizhong's regiment began to fiercely suppress the Liu bandits near Muke, killing many bandits and capturing many horses and guns. The remnants fled in a disarray to the south. The main force fled southeast from Muke, passing Yushan, Da'anzhuang, Wenquan Shimen, and crossing Youzishan, Huangshizhi, and Lianhuaguanzhuang, sneaking toward the Qishan (i.e., Qishan) area, more than 60 li southeast of Anqiu. Another small force fled from Muke to the southwest near Nixi, trying to head towards Yishui county.</p>
<p>Liu's main bandit force sneaked to the Li Jiagou-Shang Dongyu area, northeast of Qishan, where they were met head-on by the 81st Brigade Commander Tang Bangzhi, who had been lying in ambush there. After a fierce battle lasting about two hours, Liu's bandits were completely defeated, and many were killed or captured. The remnants again fled east from the Li Jiagou area across Huangban to Shishanz, and arriving at the Fan Jiagou area, about 18 or 19 li north of Manshui, south of Muke, they were again fiercely attacked head-on by the 29th Division's Gao Lantian Regiment. Many were also killed or captured. The remnants fled southwest again, and when they reached the Dianzi area, they were again attacked by the Gao Regiment and Ma Guanyi Brigade, and many bandits were killed. The remnants fled south again, and in the afternoon, they sneaked into Zhucheng county. One force of more than 100 people sneaked to the Wuji area, about 30 li west of Zhucheng, about 100 people or less. Another force fled to a place 50 or 60 li southwest of Jia Yue. The force that sneaked southwest from Muke was resolved by the Joint Village Association.</p>
<p>According to Tang Bangzhi's report from Songjiazhuang, north of Qishan, the bandit suppression this time has been a great success. A total of more than 300 bandits were killed, more than 290 were captured, more than 300 guns were obtained, and more than 300 horses were obtained. Two bandit regimental commanders, one handgun battalion commander, and one guard battalion commander were captured and executed on the spot. Furthermore, a bandit artillery battalion commander was captured. The bandits have been largely wiped out. The remainder can be cleared up soon. Han Fuju has ordered Tang to send the captured puppet artillery regimental commander and more than 290 bandits to Anqiu to be escorted by the county government to Jinan. It is also heard that seven bandits led horses and carried guns to Weixian to surrender, requesting to be spared the death penalty and willing to reform themselves. In addition, there are also many bandits who have surrendered to various districts and are being investigated and reported. A puppet seal was also seized, with the words "People's Self-Defense Army." Many soldiers were also injured and were transported to Anqiu for treatment. Currently, Tang Bangzhi, Wu Yuanxing, Ma Guanyi, and Tian Haizhong are pursuing and suppressing separately, hoping to clear up the remaining bandits in a short period of time. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Reorganization and Establishment of the Three Provinces剿匪 Headquarters: Five Divisions and One Group Office Together; He Zhuguo's Troops Victorious in剿匪in Eastern Hubei <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The剿匪Headquarters of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has decided to expand its organization to improve office efficiency. The establishment and personnel have been approved by Chiang Kai-shek at the request of Qian Dajun in Jiangxi. The reorganization and establishment will be implemented on the 16th. The organizational content originally included a Chief of Staff and a Secretary-General, with subordinate offices for Staff, Finance, Secretariat, General Affairs, Political Affairs, and Political Training. The Political Training office will be temporarily delayed, and a Confidential Group will be established instead, totaling five offices and one group. The lineup is as follows: Chief of Staff Qian Dajun, Secretary-General Yang Yongtai, Chief of the Secretariat Wu Xiangxian, concurrently Acting Secretary-General and Chief of the First Section Zhu Ben, Chief of the Second Section Hong Fang, Chief of the Third Section Luo Zongxian, Chief of the Staff Office Liu Zushun, Deputy Chief Jiang Bin, Chief of the First Section Wang Zhongsheng, Chief of the Second Section Luo Zhaozong, Chief of the Third Section Liu Molin, Chief of the Fourth Section Zhang Dajun, Chief of the General Affairs Office Liu Shoupeng, Deputy Chief Zhou Congzheng, Chief of the First Section Luo Chengwei, Chief of the Second Section Zhang Fubao, Chief of the Third Section Zhou Weifang, Chief of the General Affairs Office Tang Guozhen, Deputy Chief Ma Zhaoqi, Chief of the First Section Jiang Baohua, Chief of the Second Section Fan Xianbing, Chief of the Third Section concurrently Ma Zhaoqi, Chief of the Fourth Section Wang Qingshan, Chief of the Finance Office Min Xiangfan, Deputy Chief Wen Runfang, Chief of the First Section Yi Zhonghan, Chief of the Second Section Lu Ting, Chief of the Third Section Xu Bensheng, Chief of the Fourth Section concurrently Wen Runfang, Head of the Confidential Group Li Tiancai, Deputy Head Chen Changxin, Chief of the First Section concurrently Chen Changxin, Chief of the Second Section Wang Hengxin, Chief of the Third Section Deng Wenyi. All other staff members have also been officially appointed. All offices and groups will work together in the same location. The Finance Office, originally located on Lanling Street, has been moved into the headquarters. On the 16th, Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang convened all staff members at the headquarters to report on the reorganization process and provide instructions on work guidelines, mainly focusing on three points: (1) Have a sense of responsibility in your work and do not be perfunctory. Even with close relatives and friends, you must overcome personal feelings. (2) Prioritize the concept of the nation and pay attention to personal cultivation. (3) Eliminate all decadent habits, practice the New Life Movement, invigorate the spirit, and set an example for the people. He also reported the completion of the reorganization to Chiang Kai-shek via telegram.</p>
<p>On the 16th, Army Commander of the 57th Army, He Zhuguo, arrived in Hankou from Songbu to meet with Zhang Xueliang. He reported on the progress of剿匪in Eastern Hubei and requested instructions. Commander Chang Jingwu of He Zhuguo's division also came to Hankou. According to reports, the army was transferred to Eastern Hubei and engaged the bandits multiple times, defeating them each time and capturing many. In one battle, they even seized the bandits' "Provincial Plan," which was extremely important. The bandits have very few firearms, and their morale is low, rendering them incapable of combat. An examination of the captives revealed that they all had a sallow complexion and body hair an inch long. The bread they possessed contained only 20% rice, with the rest being weeds, roots, and tree bark, and no salt. The bandits are suffering from the effects of the blockade and lack of supplies. As a result, they lack fighting spirit. Some bandits with guns were even tied up by unarmed women. Their situation has indeed reached the end of the line, and it should not be difficult to eliminate them within the deadline. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Bandit Leader of Changhu Lake in Western Hubei Escorted from Hankou to Shashi: Police Investigation Reveals Connection to the Fujian Incident <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Sun Dazhi, Li Hongfa, Li Guanghua, Li Daxiang, Zhao Longchen, Yang Tongbai, and other six bandit leaders from Changhu Lake in Western Hubei, previously defeated by Xu Yuanquan's troops, escaped to Hankou. The headquarters of the Pacification Commissioner has been strictly searching for them without success. At the end of last month, they were arrested by the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters. A telegram was sent to report to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, and Director He Yingqin. At the same time, a strict interrogation was conducted. Li Yuanquan, Commander-in-Chief of剿匪in the Hunan-Hubei Border Area, also sent Military Law Chief Liu Xiang to Hankou to co-handle the case. It has now been determined that these bandit leaders not only entrenched themselves in the local area, committing murder and arson, but also had a great relationship with the Fujian Incident. Therefore, the authorities are determined to severely punish them according to the law in Hankou. However, these bandits buried a large number of firearms in their hometown. Lei Xiaocen, Commissioner of the Seventh Administrative Inspectorate District, specifically telegraphed the headquarters, requesting the police department to allow them to be taken back for interrogation. The headquarters forwarded the telegram to the police department on the 8th, stating: "Commander Ye of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, according to the telegram from Lei Xiaocen, Commissioner of the Seventh Administrative Inspectorate District of Hubei, Sun Dazhi, Li Guanghua, Li Hongfa, and other six major bandits from Jiangling, raised the banner of the People's Revolutionary Army during the Fujian Rebellion, harassing the local area, killing the Jingmen Team Leader, and seizing the team's firearms. They previously requested you to order the Wuhan Garrison to arrest them. Now, they have all been arrested in Hankou. However, these bandits have hidden more than 500 firearms in their hometown and must be taken back to the county for confiscation to eliminate hidden dangers. Please order that they be allowed to be taken back. Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Xueliang, Gengwu Can." At this time, Xu Yuanquan came to Hankou on official business and personally requested that they be escorted to the headquarters in Shashi. The police department agreed, and on the 13th, they replied to Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang to inform them. On the 16th, Sun Dazhi and the other six bandits were taken by the Hunan-Hubei Border Area Headquarters' resident office in Hankou and handed over to the military police battalion for escort to Shashi, awaiting strict handling.

<h3 id="e95">The Repercussions of the Stamp Duty Fine Investigation in Nanhui <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>He Ziyuan, Director of the Nanhui Fengxian Chuansha Stamp Duty Bureau, applied for resignation, which has been approved by the Provincial Bureau. Wo Yunxing has been appointed to replace him. Wo recently dispatched a large number of inspectors to various cities and towns to strictly investigate stamp duties. A dozen books and ledgers from Hongchunlou and other businesses in the city were seized a few days ago. They have now been fined 250 yuan for Qiuxin, 100 yuan for Gongtaicheng, 80 yuan for Hongchunlou, 60 yuan each for Tianzhang Houshengsxiang Qinkang, 50 yuan each for Tongfachang Wanrui Hengsheng Zhao Futai Guangrentang, 48 yuan for Renmao, and 15 yuan for Xu Shunxiang, totaling approximately one thousand gold. The merchants are ordered to pay the fines within three days, or they will be detained. The merchants claim that in the past, when directors conducted inspections, they would first issue announcements and notify the county chamber of commerce so that everyone would be aware. For example, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce would notify various trade associations and issue announcements in advance, notifying them that inspectors would be dispatched in ten days. All businesses with previously unpaid stamp duties on their books and records should pay them before the inspection period to avoid penalties. Now, Director Wo has imposed huge fines as soon as he took office, and the procedures are lacking. Therefore, yesterday, they requested the county chamber of commerce to find a way to provide relief.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Multiple Robberies Occur on the Waterways of Wuxi <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>There is a scheduled ship between Changxing Sian, Zhejiang, and Wuxi, specializing in transporting goods for various businesses. The ship owner, Lu Ronglin, set sail from Wuxi on the 14th of this month. When the ship arrived at Daxuankou in Taihu Lake, it was blocked by a strong wind and could not proceed. It anchored there. On the morning of the 17th, the wind had subsided, so it sailed as usual. Unexpectedly, when it reached Dajiaoshan, about forty li away from Daxuankou, it was suddenly attacked by a pirate ship. Nine pirates jumped out, all wearing short casual clothes and speaking with a strong northern accent. They each held fierce weapons, shouted for the ship to stop, and fired two shots as a warning. Upon seeing this, the ship owner, Lu Ronglin, stopped the ship. The pirates boarded the ship one after another, first monitoring all the crew members and preventing them from moving. Then they overturned the cabins and searched arbitrarily. After about an hour, they took the stolen goods and jumped back onto their original ship, speeding away. After checking, it was found that goods and silver dollars worth more than 2,000 yuan had been stolen. The ship was turned back to Daxuankou. In addition to reporting the information to the Zhaowu warship of the Second Water Police District stationed there, requesting the arrest of the stolen goods and thieves, they came to the city yesterday to report to the shipping trade association, which in turn reported to the county government for investigation. Furthermore, in the Gexiang Shangdahekou area near Luoshe Town, District 16 (Wananshi), six bandits, carrying a box gun and three pistols, robbed four ships in succession. A Qian-family lime boat lost more than forty yuan. A Tao Yinsheng bamboo shoot boat from Xiaotaoxiang was robbed of bamboo shoot money worth more than ten yuan. A Jiangbei passenger ship was robbed of fifty or sixty yuan. A duck boat was robbed of more than twenty ducks.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Snippets of Sericulture News <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Qingming has passed, and silkworm rearing is about to begin. Here are some sericulture news highlights: (1) The Spring Silkworm Rearing Guidance Center established by the County Agricultural Extension Office dispatched instructors yesterday to carry out disinfection and other work in the villages. After several days of rain, the mulberry trees in the four villages have turned green one after another. The Extension Office has distributed silkworm eggs to the guidance centers and will start incubation immediately. The silkworms can be released after twelve days. (2) In recent years, sericulture in our country has failed, for two reasons: (a) most of it is due to the sluggish silk market, (b) the young silkworms raised are of poor quality, often leading to complete failure. The National Economic Committee has taken this into account and is conducting research. As a result, young silkworms should not eat ordinary mulberry leaves, so improved mulberry trees are specially planted for young silkworms to eat. Since the trial was successful, various places have adopted it one after another. The farm of the Provincial Education College in this county has also purchased 10,000 improved mulberry seedlings from Hangzhou for planting and feeding. (3) Xu Wenwei, the principal of Weijiadang Elementary School in the Third School District, held a lecture on sericulture knowledge at the school, which was attended by many people every day.</p>

This month is designated as the preparation period, and they will be established in order next year. Although it is not possible to establish a local court in each county as originally planned, they will add them as appropriate in the face of difficulties.</p>

<p>The family of Han Jinkui in Hanjiazhuang, District 10, Gaoyou, has a self-defense gun with one bullet stored inside, placed in the wing room. The other day, Jinkui led his family to work in the fields, leaving a seven-year-old child at home to watch the door. The child, bored alone, invited two neighboring children to play at home. Unexpectedly, he took out the gun and played with it, triggering the firing pin. With a loud bang, the bullet was fired, hitting the faces and legs of the two neighboring children. They both fainted and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The child hit in the face died instantly. The child hit in the leg was sent to the hospital by his family for treatment and is not in serious danger.</p>

<p>More than ten li outside the south gate of Jiaxing, a certain project is currently under construction, with thousands of workers rushing to build it. However, they are only given food every day, and wages are delayed. This has caused some workers to be dissatisfied and angered the foreman, Wang Asi. The group demanded payment, and a disagreement led to more than a dozen small laborers surrounding and violently beating Wang Asi. He immediately lost consciousness. He died of his injuries yesterday. The head foreman prepared a document and reported it to the County Construction Section for investigation. However, the dozen or so murderers had already fled far away and none were apprehended.</p>

<p>Since Huang Fu, Chairman of the Administrative Yuan's Peace Political Reorganization Committee stationed in Ping, arrived in Shanghai, all parties have paid close attention to his meetings with Japanese officials. In addition to the Japanese Ambassador Arima, accompanied by Counselor Arino, and the Military Attaché of the Embassy, Suzuki, who had already paid a visit on the morning of the day before yesterday, the Naval Attaché Sato also visited at 10:30 a.m. yesterday, holding a long conversation that lasted as long as forty minutes before leaving.

<p>Xinxin News Agency reports that Wang Zhenqiu, Dai Enrong, Yuan Zhenhai, and other representatives of disabled veterans of the Northeastern Volunteer Army's anti-Japanese forces, sent a letter yesterday to Huang Fu, Chairman of the Peace Political Reorganization Committee in Peiping (excerpt): "You are handling the entire diplomatic relationship in North China. You went from Peiping to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to request instructions on the policy. Premier Wang also went to Jiangxi for an important meeting. We heard that there are appropriate coping measures. We recall that the loss of our four northeastern provinces was all due to the cunning threats of the Japanese pirates. Since the truce agreement was concluded, although the war has ended, the Japanese pirates have been actively engaged in military, political, and cultural activities at all times. Looking at their troop strength on the border of Rehe, it continues to thicken. Aircraft reconnaissance is carried out from time to time. The garrison troops in the Japanese concession areas are conducting live-fire exercises at all times in preparation for war, wanting to carry out the old tricks of September 18th in the future. Taking advantage of the armistice agreement, they will launch an attack when we are unprepared. The nation is in danger, and this is urgent. We sincerely ask you to uphold the teachings of the late Premier, to seek the principles of freedom and equality for China, to uphold the revolutionary spirit of unyielding and fearlessness, to awaken the unity of the compatriots, to strengthen themselves and save themselves, to fight together. The rise and fall of the country, the 400 million compatriots, only you depend on it. I will not say much. I respectfully ask for your peace and look forward to your reply."</p>

<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, accompanied by Director of the Trademark Bureau He Zhuoxian, took the Grand President liner of the Da Lai Company to inspect various ports in Nanyang yesterday. Chen boarded a small boat from the Customs Wharf at 12:30 p.m. yesterday to board the Grand President liner. Those who came to see him off included Vice Minister of Industry Liu Weizhi, Director of the International Trade Bureau He Bingxian, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau Cai Wuji, and industrialists Guo Shun and more than ten others. The ship set sail at 3 p.m. yesterday. Chen is scheduled to stay in Nanyang for more than a month. The affairs of the ministry are handled by Vice Minister Liu Weichi.</p>
<p>Before leaving Shanghai, Chen issued a written statement stating that since the late Qing Dynasty, when Yang Shiqi of the Ministry of Commerce inspected Nanyang, more than twenty years have passed, and no important central personnel have gone to comfort the overseas Chinese. Since I took on the responsibility of the Ministry of Industry, I have intended to travel to Nanyang. In January of last year, the itinerary was set, but it was suspended due to the Battle of Shanhai Pass. This time, the affairs of the Ministry of Industry have come to a slight pause. For example, the Ammonium Sulfate Plant has been contracted to Fan Xudong and will be built in Pukou and can be completed next year. The fine yarn spinning machine has been decided to be handled directly by the Gengkuan Board of Directors and the Water Conservancy Agency. The Central Machine Factory has also sent personnel to England to purchase machinery. The entire plan for the Central Iron and Steel Plant has been completed and only awaits the evaluation of prices by American experts. The funds for the Shanghai Fish Market have also been raised. Therefore, I will take this opportunity to go to Nanyang to inspect the local industrial situation and comfort the overseas Chinese. This trip will last about one and a half months, with Saigon, Singapore, Java, and the Philippines as the main inspection sites. The approximate date of return will not be later than June 10th.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers in the Public Concession Yesterday: Motion to Abolish the Band Rejected, Remaining Motions Passed <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession for this term was held at the Carlton Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road at 5 p.m. yesterday. First, General Manager Bell of the Public Works Department gave a speech, reporting on the work and accounts of the previous year. Finally, the issue of whether to retain or abolish the Public Works Department's band was discussed. Some foreigners opposed the abolition and decided to retain it. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e108">Eight Motions <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>There were a total of eight motions submitted at the annual meeting: (1) Motions 1 to 3: To elect the chairman and secretary and to adopt the rules of meeting procedure. (2) Motion 4: To approve the reports and accounts for the entire year of 1933. (3) Motion 5: To approve and adopt the budget expenditure for 1934 proposed by the current board of directors, along with various recommendations, and to authorize the Public Works Department to levy and collect the proposed taxes and fees. If it is deemed appropriate, the Public Works Department shall be allowed to raise funds up to a maximum of 15.5 million yuan, according to the conditions and methods it stipulates, to cover the various uses specified in the temporary expenditure budget. (4) Motion 6: To elect the Real Estate Committee for the next year. Please elect Mr. Bick as the Real Estate Committee for the next year. (5) Motion 7: To elect four directors of the Public Charity Hospital for the next year. (6) Motion 8: Please abolish the Bureau's band within this year.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Superintendent's Report <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting began, General Superintendent Bell of the Public Works Department first reported on the work and accounts of the previous year, stating that, in past annual meetings of taxpayers, the General Superintendent of the Public Works Department has always briefly described political events related to the administration of the concession. Looking at the past year, everything has been very peaceful, and order and peace have been maintained. This is something to be satisfied with.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Extramural Roads <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The discussion of this issue has been repeatedly started and stopped without concrete results. The reason for this is largely due to the fact that China and Japan have different opinions on the organization and personnel of the proposed police force. The discussions have repeatedly approached a deadlock, but all parties have been able to exercise tact and patience, and with the help of the outside world, the discussions have not been interrupted. It is now believed that there has been real progress on this issue. Although the steps are very slow, it is hoped that it will eventually reach a solution. As for the details of the negotiations, the Bureau has not been able to announce them in detail. This is because the Bureau must take into account the claims of other parties for the sake of the progress of the negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Factory Inspection <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there has been no progress on the factory inspection issue. This is because neither the Bureau nor the Chinese authorities have been able to back down or change their positions. The details of this issue were reported in detail at last year's special meeting of taxpayers.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Education Issues <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The General Superintendent's report last year mentioned that the education costs for 1933 would be higher than the previous two years, accounting for about one-tenth of total revenue. In 1931, the Bureau passed an education plan. When the entire plan is implemented, education costs will account for about 16% of the total annual revenue. However, there was an understanding at that time that the plan would be reconsidered at the end of 1934 based on the situation. Because the expenditure on education is directly related to taxes and is an important item in the budget, the Board of Directors felt that this plan could not but be immediately reconsidered in January of this year when considering this year's budget proposal and could not wait until the end of the year. After detailed discussion by the Finance Committee and the Board of Directors, four principles were decided: (1) The total amount of education expenses in 1934 shall not exceed the amount of two cents of municipal tax and land tax. If there are slight discrepancies in the number of subsidies, they will be balanced in the following year. (2) The maintenance costs of Bureau-run Chinese and Western schools should occupy the first item of education expenses, but their expenses should be reduced to the lowest possible level without harming efficiency. (3) Except for those already stipulated in the budget and those under construction, no new schools will be added. It will be considered again at the end of this year. (4) An additional 50,000 yuan will be allocated for subsidies to Chinese schools, and an additional 20,000 yuan will be allocated for subsidies to Japanese schools. If municipal taxes increase, the education plan should be reconsidered. This suspension is deeply regrettable, but there is no other solution until the economic situation improves.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Rickshaw Affairs <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The rickshaw issue has attracted much public attention in recent months. The Bureau has been paying attention to this issue for years. The reason why the current corrupt situation has not been eliminated is that the police department believes that it is impossible to manage effectively unless rickshaw pullers are registered and licensed, and it is extremely difficult to enforce the registration and licensing of rickshaw pullers. However, the Board of Directors adopted the report of the investigation committee on March 21 this year. The main points are well known to the public. The Bureau will not delay or evade this and wants to achieve practical results in the shortest possible time. The next Board of Directors will also proceed with this intention and take all reasonable actions to put the rickshaw business on the right track. As for the first three recommendations in the report, the reason for their temporary non-implementation is not that the Board of Directors is hesitating, but that there are still many uncertain factors in them, and the implementation of the other thirteen recommendations and the attitude of the rickshaw owners are all related. This economic and social issue is complex in nature and must be resolved calmly and appropriately. Because its business is so large, although there are many drawbacks, the rickshaw owners must first be given an opportunity to improve themselves according to the conditions in this time of economic decline. Otherwise, sudden elimination will have serious implications. As for the ultimate goal, it is to abolish rickshaws, but it must be implemented gradually. During this period, we should strive to improve the status of rickshaw pullers and improve vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Last Year's Accounts <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Last year's income and expenditure accounts and the report of the Chief Financial Officer have been sent to all taxpayers on schedule. Now, I will only briefly mention the key points. Last year's income was indeed higher than the previous year, but it was 728,263 taels less than expected. Fortunately, efforts were made to reduce expenditures, and the administrative departments spent 634,130 taels less, resulting in a surplus of 19,597 taels. As for the temporary expenses, there was a deficit of 3,545,375 taels. This is not an over-expenditure, nor is it that we cannot borrow money. Because of the economic situation in the port, the Bureau has some cash on hand and cannot invest it for the time being. Since we have cash on hand, we should not borrow money and bear the loss of interest. The sale price of the electrical department, 8.1 million taels, was received in full at the end of last year. How this money will be spent is detailed in the report. Now, I propose that taxpayers approve the work report and accounts as of December 31, 1933.</p>
<h3 id="e115">This Year's Budget <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Bell then discussed this year's budget, stating that the budget has been revised to use silver dollar figures, with the listed items and additional explanations not elaborated upon. He only briefly mentioned one or two key points. It is found that the regular budget for this year can increase revenue by approximately 1,280,000 yuan. Among them, 960,000 yuan is due to the increase in land tax from the revaluation of land last year. Other revenues have also slightly increased, except for the vegetable market rental, which will be short by about 32,000 yuan. Regular expenses amount to 26,390,060 yuan, exceeding last year's by 1,400,000 yuan. As the electricity department's funds have been cleared and debts need to be incurred this year, the interest account will be in deficit by 920,000 yuan this year. Although administrative expenses in various departments have been reduced as much as possible, major affairs and security expenses are higher than last year, but public works expenditures have been reduced somewhat, which can slightly compensate. In the education budget, it is estimated to spend 2,263,470 yuan, an increase of 77,000 yuan compared to last year. The board of directors has carefully considered the education policy and funding, and has been forced to temporarily postpone the establishment of new schools. It is estimated that the regular budget for ordinary expenses is short by about 1,950,000 yuan, equivalent to the three-quarter collection of the two percent municipal donation. In normal circumstances, an increase in donations is inevitable, but in view of the economic situation in this port, it has been decided to withdraw 2 million yuan from the general reserve fund. However, the reserve fund cannot be relied upon permanently, so this year's approach is only to postpone the unavoidable increase in donations. Under the temporary expenses item, a total of 25,740,830 yuan is required, of which 1,030,000 yuan is temporary education expenses. The repayment of public debt requires 11,362,130 yuan, and the construction continuation expenses for police and sanitation are also significant. As for the revenue side, 7,000,000 yuan is taken from the fund account to repay the 1924 public debt. In order to cope with temporary expenditures, it is proposed to ask taxpayers to allow the board of directors to raise 15,500,000 yuan, either by issuing public bonds or by other methods. This amount seems excessive, but the board of directors has not fully utilized the amount of funds approved by taxpayers last year (only 2,800,000 yuan was used), and the shortfall has been transferred from other cash funds. This fund was originally prepared for investment. A photograph of the general director's report at the foreign taxpayers' annual meeting was taken.</p>
<p>The 5 million yuan used today should be returned this year. Furthermore, at the end of last year, the actual debt of this term, after offsetting the debt reduction fund, was only 7,500,000 taels. For a community as large as this one, the debt is only this much, which is quite remarkable. It is now proposed to ask taxpayers to approve and adopt the board of directors' proposed 1934 expenditure budget and the attached recommendations, and authorize the board of directors to levy the proposed donations and taxes. If taxpayers deem it appropriate, please also approve the board of directors to raise 15,500,000 yuan in accordance with appropriate conditions and methods for the specified purposes in the temporary expense budget.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Disbanding the Orchestra <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Bell also stated that this year's budget is only balanced by drawing on the reserve fund, and expansion cannot be stopped. Therefore, the board of directors discussed reducing expenditures. However, some people believe that the orchestra, which is considered a luxury, costs about 300,000 yuan, and only a few people can appreciate it, which is considered inappropriate. The opinions of the members of the board of directors are not consistent on this issue. Some believe that since the orchestra does not receive the appreciation and support of the majority of people, it should be abolished. Others believe that this is the only purely cultural institution maintained by the bureau's public funds, and it is a pity to abolish it. In the past, the board of directors has always allowed taxpayers to initiate motions regarding the existence or abolition of the orchestra. In 1923 and 1927, there were motions to abolish the orchestra at the annual meeting, but they were not adopted. Although the opinions within the board of directors were not consistent this time, most directors, in view of the financial difficulties next year, decided that this issue should be initiated by the board of directors and submitted to the taxpayers' meeting. The act of increasing donations cannot be postponed indefinitely. Although the orchestra's expenses are only a small part of the expenditure, it cannot be ignored for the sake of saving. The proposal now put forward is due to the board of directors' self-awareness of its responsibility to seek the clear opinions of taxpayers on this matter. It is now proposed to take appropriate measures within this fiscal year to abolish the orchestra.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Thanking Mr. Hu Mengjia <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Bell, the chairman of the Public Works Bureau, sent a letter to Mr. Hu Mengjia yesterday on behalf of the entire board of directors, thanking him for his service to the public for the past three years, as Mr. Hu will no longer serve as a Chinese director this year. In addition to serving as a director for the past three years, Mr. Hu has also served as a member of the Security Committee and the Public Utilities Committee, making great contributions to various discussions. All members of the board of directors deeply admire him, and all directors hope that Mr. Hu can recover his health quickly with this rest.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Orchestra Retained <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>After the report was completed, each item was discussed and passed unanimously according to the agenda. When discussing the abolition of the Public Works Bureau Orchestra, Mr. Harris stood up to oppose the board of directors' proposal, saying that everything in the concession is progressing rapidly, and music is closely related to culture. Comparing the Public Works Bureau's annual income with the orchestra's expenditure, it cannot be said to be a waste and should be maintained. After many people seconded the motion, discussions began, and it was decided to retain the orchestra. Therefore, the motion to abolish the orchestra proposed by the Public Works Bureau's board of directors was rejected, and its life can be extended for at least one year.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Rent Issue <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Mr. Bowman stood up again and asked about the rent issue in the concession. Mr. Bell replied that the rent in the concession has the same nature as commodity prices, and its rise and fall cannot be controlled by the Public Works Bureau's board of directors, so he cannot express any opinion. During the meeting, the Feetham Report was also mentioned. Mr. Bell explained that because of the strong opposition from the Chinese side and the indifferent attitude of various countries, his proposal could not be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Chinese Taxpayers' Association Requests the Public Works Bureau to Implement Eight Resolutions and Notifies Attendance at the Land Committee <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>

<p>Japanese ships on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have suspended service since January 28, waiting for an opportunity to resume. Since the issue of the Sichuan River Shipping Alliance raising fees, a good opportunity has been created for Japanese goods to enter Sichuan. Japanese ships are also seizing this opportunity to resume upriver navigation. The first ship, fully loaded with goods, sailed upstream this morning. Because Sichuan is filled with inferior goods, an anti-traitor group has been organized. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e122">Japanese Ships Today <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Nisshin Steamship Company's plan to resume shipping on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River plans to start with Yichang, because Yichang is an important place for entering Sichuan. The direct Shanghai-Yichang route will be resumed first. The Xinyang Maru, which has been berthed in Shanghai, has been greatly repaired and will be used for the Shanghai-Yichang service. The first voyage resumed this morning. It was fully loaded with goods yesterday, mostly Japanese goods. The Danyang Maru is also being repaired and it has been decided to operate this ship on the Hankou-Yichang route. It is expected to start service in about two weeks.</p>

<p>Recently, many Japanese goods have been sold in various parts of Sichuan. They are often disguised and shipped secretly. Now, in order to implement the rejection of Japanese goods and maintain the sales of domestic products, people from all walks of life in Chongqing have organized an anti-traitor group to investigate the import of inferior goods and the trafficking of traitors. Once inspected, the goods will be confiscated and the private traffickers will be severely punished.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Reduce Export Egg Tax - Request to Handle According to the Old Tax Regulations of 1920 <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday: "To the Honorable Ministry of Finance, we received a letter from the Egg Industry Association this month stating that in recent years, with the global economic downturn, the national economy has fallen into a more precarious situation. The reason is due to the decline in exports and the frequent increase in trade deficits, leading to rural bankruptcy and industrial and commercial decline. If this continues, it will be as Mr. Zhang Gongquan said, 'If China's agricultural and industrial products cannot find a way to increase foreign exports in the future, the prospects are dire.' We have seen that in the recent 40 years, the gradual reduction of egg exports and the gradual decline of domestic egg prices have had a great impact on the rural economy and social finance. The way to save the situation is not to improve the quality of goods, but to reduce costs. At present, most egg exports are iced wet eggs. Iced wet eggs have been repeatedly researched and perfected, and the quality of goods has reached a high standard. There is nothing to criticize. Only in terms of cost, other countries enjoy tax-free exports and transportation subsidies, while the export tax on domestic eggs is very heavy, which makes it difficult to compete. We have repeatedly submitted requests to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Industry to exempt the export egg tax, following the example of other countries, but it has not been approved. We are deeply worried. Now we will list the decline in the total value of egg exports since 1919, according to the customs figures, as follows:</p>
<p>Year Total Value of Egg Exports</p>
<p>1919 Customs Silver 51,160,972 taels (equivalent to 79,710,940 silver dollars)</p>
<p>1920 Customs Silver 37,757,544 taels (equivalent to 58,827,838 silver dollars)</p>
<p>1921 Silver Dollars 44,302,413 yuan</p>
<p>1922 Silver Dollars 36,489,477 yuan</p>
<p>Looking at the table on the right, we know that China's egg exports have gradually declined since 1920. The reason is that the egg production of various countries has increased, and prices have been lowered and dumped. Various countries that need eggs have frequently increased tariffs to restrict our imports. Our government, since June 1, 1920, has increased the huge export egg tax, which is a fatal blow. Under the double blow of the industry, it is dying. All countries implement tariff protection policies. The import of foreign goods depends on the needs and the amount of tax levied. For the export of domestic goods Category Old Tax Regulations New Tax Regulations Increase Multiple</p>
<p>A. Iced wet egg white, egg yolk, and mixed ice eggs 2.25 mace of positive tax and 1.125 mace of surtax per dan 1.5 taels of customs silver per dan 3.5 times</p>
<p>B. Fresh eggs (including fresh frozen eggs) 2.8 fen of positive tax and 1.4 fen of surtax per thousand 7.5% ad valorem, about 2 times</p>
<p>C. Dried egg white and egg yolk, mixed dried eggs 1.5 taels of positive tax and 7.7 fen of surtax per dan 4.5 taels of customs silver per dan 1 time</p>
<p>D. Preserved eggs and salted eggs 3.5 fen of positive tax and 1.75 fen of surtax per thousand 0.66 taels of customs silver per thousand 26%</p>
<p>In recent years, China's dried egg exports have been almost non-existent. Although iced fresh eggs still have a small number of sales in Europe, it is difficult to transport and sell them due to the heavy increase in new tax rates at home and abroad. Based on the current egg price, the export tax on iced fresh eggs is about 15%. If the government does not find a way to reduce or exempt it, in the future, when gold is cheap and silver is expensive, our country's egg exports will not only be unable to maintain the original sales channels, but also this existing position will be gradually deprived. From the above situation, it is impossible to develop egg exports, adjust the rural economy, and save the trade deficit without exempting the export egg tax. Therefore, we have specifically listed the decline of egg exports in detail and sincerely request your association to forward it to the Ministry of Finance. We urge the Ministry of Finance to exempt the export egg tax as soon as possible. If the Ministry of Finance is concerned about the budget, before there is a corresponding compensation, please temporarily collect the old tax before June 1920, and then seek another compensation method to achieve a complete exemption, which will be greatly appreciated. We have received a letter from the egg factory industry association with the same situation, and we have telegraphed your ministry on March 30 this year to request a reduction. Although tax-free exports are an international practice, in today's difficult financial situation, we cannot afford this extravagance. We want to adjust the surplus and make up for the deficiency, and the burden should not be excessive. Our country's export tax was originally 5% ad valorem. Since 1916, the surtax has been increased to 7.05% ad valorem. At that time, according to the old tax regulations, the estimate was still low, so the increase was not significant. Since June 1920, after the export tax regulations were revised, all specific tax regulations were re-estimated according to recent prices, which increased them invisibly. Therefore, although the tax rate has not changed from the old one in 1916, the actual payment is higher than before. If prices are stable, this 7.05% ad valorem specific tax can still be said to be in line with the actual situation. However, the market price has fallen sharply, and the nature of specific tax is fixed, not like ad valorem tax, which can rise and fall at any time. Therefore, this difficult situation is not only felt by one industry. Each industry has requested a reduction, but your ministry has replied that the tax rate has not increased. In fact, merchants seek profit, and the tax is of course included in the cost. If the price falls, the income decreases, but the tax has not decreased proportionally. Therefore, there is no name for increasing the tax rate, but there is an increase in the actual tax amount. The business is difficult to support, and the business is declining. The export statistics for the most recent three years attached to the association's document this time are enough to show that it is not empty talk. If the export trade of the industry decreases year by year, then the country will inevitably reduce the tax revenue even without a tax reduction order. We believe that your ministry has a high vision and should start with cultivating tax sources. We humbly request that you consider the request of the association and handle it appropriately, which will be in the public interest. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows and submits."</p>

<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, etc., feeling that the construction of the Northwest cannot be delayed, have organized the Construction Bank Company to make huge investments in the Northwest. With Song's efforts, the banks in Shanghai have discussed the matter many times and have fully supported it. The capital has also been fully subscribed. This large-scale Construction Bank Company will be realized soon. The reporter of Shen Shi News Agency will report on Song's recent active progress as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Subscribers Have Signed <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The capital stock of the Construction Bank Company is a total of 10 million yuan. Shareholders are banks, and individual shares are not accepted. After Song contacted them many times, the Central, China, and Communications banks have all agreed to join, with the Central Bank contributing 4 million yuan, the China Bank 2 million yuan, the Communications Bank 1.5 million yuan, and the Shanghai Bank 500,000 yuan. The remaining shares are subscribed by Zhejiang Industrial, Kenye, Siming, Salt, Jin Cheng, Continental, and Zhongnan banks, with each subscribing 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, totaling 10 million yuan. As for the subscription documents of each bank, the Central, China, and Communications banks were signed by Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Gongquan, and Tang Shoumin on behalf of the three banks on the afternoon of the 16th. The remaining banks can also fully identify and sign the documents in the next two days to complete the subscription procedures.</p>

They have been reviewed and approved by the subscribers in detail. These articles of association will be formally signed by the subscribers and then negotiated and decided. Another formal copy will be prepared and submitted to the ministry for record before it can be officially released. According to Song's associates, who spoke to the Shen Shi News Agency reporter yesterday, the articles of association contain only a few simple clauses, stipulating a capital of 10 million yuan. Foreign shares are also welcome to join as investment projects and will not be rejected.</p>

<p>Song Ziwen believes that the construction of the Northwest is a major undertaking and cannot be accomplished without pooling the financial resources of China. In addition to seeking the approval of various banks to subscribe to shares as shareholders, he is also seeking powerful figures from all parties to join as sponsors of the company. It is said that Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang, Qian Xinzhi, etc. are all being sought. As for the military and political leaders in the Northwest, such as Shao Lizi, Yang Hucheng, and Zhu Shaoliang, they are also planned to be invited to join as sponsors.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Truth About the Minqiang Accident - The Extent of the Damage Is Still Minor - The Minxian Has Been Dispatched to Rescue <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Minsheng Company's Minqiang ship, which travels the Shanghai-Chongqing route, set sail from Chongqing on the 16th, loaded with cargo and passengers, bound for Yichang. On the morning of the 17th, the Minqiang ship arrived near Xintan. Due to the rising water, it was difficult to navigate. The ship hit a reef, and the bottom of the ship was broken by the reef, which was very dangerous. Fortunately, the captain quickly drove the ship to a shallow sandy shore, so that the ship was stranded, avoiding immediate sinking. This is the truth about the accident that day.</p>
<p>American Ships Pass By Fearing that the goods in each cabin would be damaged by water and in order to save the ship, the captain unloaded all the goods one by one and temporarily piled them on the riverside. At that time, the American merchant's Yichang ship of the Jiejiang Company happened to pass upstream. Seeing that the Minqiang ship had run aground after hitting a reef, it had to relay the message to the Minsheng Company in Chongqing to send a ship to rescue it.</p>
<p>Report to Shanghai On the afternoon of the 17th, the Jiejiang Company received a radio message from the Yiping ship, reporting that the Minsheng Company's Minqiang ship had hit a reef at Xintan, the ship was leaking, and it had sunk on the riverside. At that time, the Yiping ship saw with its own eyes that the Minqiang ship had run aground after hitting a reef, obviously with a hole in the bottom of the ship, and saw that the goods in the ship had been unloaded, so the telegram was sent to Shanghai, stating that the Minqiang had already sunk on the riverside of Xintan. After receiving the telegram, the Jiejiang also informed the Shanghai Minsheng Company.</p>
<p>Rescue Is Underway Now According to the news from the Minsheng Industrial Company in this port yesterday, the Minqiang ship was at Xintan. Because the water was rushing, it passed through the reefs and was broken by the reefs, causing the ship to leak. Now the head office has urgently dispatched the Minxian ship to rescue it. It is planned to load the goods unloaded from the Minqiang ship onto the Minding and carry them back to Chongqing. The passengers on the ship were not harmed. As for the Minqiang ship, it has not yet sunk. It will be repaired after the hole is repaired, and when the river rises, it will be towed away.</p>
<h3 id="e130">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Stops Building River Ships <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company borrowed 400,000 pounds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to build new ships. In addition to the four ocean-going ships, which have been ordered in the UK, it was originally planned to build three river ships at the same time. However, because the construction cost of the ocean-going ships exceeded the budget, it was changed to one river ship. Now, because the purchase of materials requires too much budget, it is not enough for two ships. Also, because the river transport has declined in recent years, and the company's existing river ships were all built after the European War, the machinery is still new and sufficient for use. Therefore, the construction of river ships has been decided to be suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Copper Industry Representative Yu Zhongnan and Others Went to Beijing Last Night to Petition - Japanese Copper Imports Reached More Than 5,000 Dan in Two Months - Chinese Merchants and Copper Factories Are Almost on the Verge of Bankruptcy - Please the Ministry of Industry to Levy a Tax on the Dumping of Foreign Copper <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The copper industry has recently seen that Japanese merchants, taking advantage of the sluggish market conditions in our city, are dumping goods at low prices at the expense of profits, hoping to restore their copper sheet business in China, which they have manipulated for many years. However, some unscrupulous merchants have been used by them, greedily importing goods at low prices, which has affected our Chinese merchants and factories and put them on the verge of bankruptcy. According to recent statistics from the customs, in two months, imports of Japanese copper sheets have reached more than 5,000 dan. The others not included are the ones secretly ordered for those factories. The situation is very dangerous. Now, Yu Zhongnan of the China Copper Factory, Zhu Zhennan of the Nanchang Copper Factory, Yu Ruilin of the China Copper Factory, etc., in line with the principle of helping each other in the same boat, have jointly discussed countermeasures with all the copper factories in Shanghai. After several meetings, they decided to submit a request to the government to levy a tax on the dumping of foreign copper, which can directly resist the invasion of foreign goods and indirectly maintain the lifeline of domestic copper sheets. Now, the factories have appointed Yu Zhongnan as their representative to take the request to Beijing and petition the Ministry of Industry. It is said that Yu left for Beijing on the night train yesterday (18th).</p>
<h3 id="e132">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Hopes for Understanding Between Labor and Management - Circulates Letters to All Industries to Maintain the Status Quo - Asks the Federation of Trade Unions to Mediate at Any Time <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Federation of Trade Unions stating that for several months, labor unrest has been rampant and disputes have arisen repeatedly. It requested that all industries be informed of the need for capital to do their best to maintain the status quo in order to avoid provoking labor unrest. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has forwarded the letter to all industry associations in the city for their information. It has also replied to the Federation of Trade Unions: "In reply, we have received your letter No. 119, requesting us to inform all industries that capital should do its best to maintain the status quo out of a sense of shared fate. Your statement that both labor and management are in a state of distress is a clear understanding of the situation. We have already forwarded the letter to all industries, asking them to understand this intention and strive for cooperation. However, we have additional comments on the level of doing our best to maintain the status quo. If, due to overproduction and stockpiling, it is necessary to reduce work and wages, labor should also understand. This is in line with the intention of shared fate mentioned in your letter. If there are differences in opinion, they should also wait for the party and government authorities to mediate according to law. The decline of industry and commerce today means that strict adherence to maintaining the status quo will inevitably lead to stockpiling and a failure to reduce production, a fall in prices and a failure to reduce wages. The dispute between the workers of the Mei-Ya Company for many days has become a very noteworthy situation in the recent labor unrest. It may not be caused by this misunderstanding of the workers. We still hope that your federation will mediate impartially at any time, which will be of utmost importance."</p>

<h3 id="e138">Special Envoy Shen Yi Appointed to Attend the Seventh International Road Conference; Rumors of Resignation Due to Incidental Participation in Yellow River Experiment <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>There are widespread rumors that Shen Yi, the director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, will submit his resignation to the Municipal Government and accept an invitation from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to travel to Germany to study water conservancy. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency specifically visited Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu and Public Works Bureau Section Chief Tang yesterday, both of whom strongly denied the error of this statement. However, Director Shen will indeed attend the International Road Conference and participate in the Yellow River Experiment. The statements of Yu and Tang are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Road Conference <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Secretary-General Yu stated that the Municipal Government intends to send six representatives to attend the Seventh International Road Conference, which will be held in Germany in June and July of this year. Director Shen is a specialist in engineering, so he will be invited to be one of the six representatives. At present, Shen's opinion is still being sought. Even if it becomes a reality, it will only be a temporary leave of absence, and there will be no resignation. The rumors circulating outside are likely a misunderstanding of this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Yellow River Experiment <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>According to Public Works Bureau Section Chief Tang, in addition to the Municipal Government's plan to invite Director Shen to attend the International Road Conference, the National Economic Commission will also entrust Shen to go to Germany to participate in the Yellow River Experiment. Dr. Engel, a professor at Dreo Jew University in Germany, is the world's only researcher studying the governance of the Yellow River. He is currently excavating a model of the Yellow River to conduct various experiments on dredging, setting up sluice gates, and guiding water flow. The National Economic Commission believes that this experiment is of great importance to the prevention of floods in China over the years, so it has provided Dr. Engel with the necessary funds. Director Shen and he have a close relationship as teacher and student. The experiment is scheduled to begin around June of this year, at which time Shen will be invited to participate.</p>
<h3 id="e141">The Municipal Land Bureau Continues to Survey Land Throughout the City; Expected Completion in the 25th Year of the Republic <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang issued an order to the provincial and municipal governments, requiring that land surveying projects during the political era be completed on schedule, the Municipal Government has forwarded the order to the responsible authorities for expedited handling. A reporter specifically inquired with the responsible authorities of the city to inquire about the current situation, as follows:</p>
<p>Original Plan: Shanghai was originally formed by merging a portion of the areas belonging to Baoshan and Shanghai counties. The areas originally belonging to Baoshan County, such as Zhen, Ru, Pengpu, Wusong, Jiangwan, and Gaoqiao districts, were surveyed during the Baoshan County period. All surveying projects have been transferred to the Land Bureau for safekeeping. Therefore, when Zhang Yuejun was the Mayor of Shanghai, he planned to complete the surveying of the entire city by the 24th year of the Republic, so that the project could be completed on schedule, and surveying funds of more than 400,000 yuan were approved.</p>
<p>Unexpected Changes: Unexpectedly, Japanese troops clashed with our troops in Zhabei the year before last, causing the January 28th Incident, which was delayed for several months. In addition, the municipal treasury was extremely strained due to the impact of the war. The surveying funds were reduced, and the surveying project was suspended midway, resulting in the inability to complete it on schedule.</p>
<p>Current Situation: Since July of the 21st year, some of the work has been restored. Currently, about one-fifth has not yet been completed. The areas of Hunan, Caohejing, Fahua, and Zhabei Yinxiang, Yangsi, and Tangqiao in Shanghai have all been completed. However, a portion of the areas of Pusong and Yangjing has not yet been completed. The areas of Gaohang and Luhang have not yet started surveying. Currently, there are two teams from the Land Bureau surveying in the Chinese area, and they are continuing to survey. If funds can be arranged, the entire city surveying project can be completed in the 25th year of the Republic. As for the Special Zone, two surveying teams from the Land Bureau are also surveying separately. The road sections built across the border have been surveyed. Surveying is now starting in the western area of the Special Zone, and will be extended to the entire Special Zone in the future. All local landowners in the Special Zone, except for foreigners' deed contracts, will no longer have to exchange land licenses. However, Chinese landowners will still have to gradually exchange them, resulting in the transfer of rights, and there are often many difficulties in the work. The authorities of the concessions have been repeatedly negotiated with, so the progress is currently relatively convenient.</p>

<p>Since the disappearance of the CNAC Sikosky aircraft on the 17th, Mrs. Gastor, the pilot's wife, has frequently visited the company to inquire.

<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Nichi Nichi Shimbun yesterday, Imai Zennosuke, an Osaka native and pharmacist currently residing at No. 30, Lane 172, Kunshan Road, was found to be secretly manufacturing and selling heroin. On the 16th, police from the Japanese Consulate, along with Municipal Council police, raided his premises and seized manufacturing equipment and semi-finished products. According to the suspect's confession, he came to Shanghai three years ago and secretly manufactured heroin in his residence at the request of two Chinese men, Wang and Chen. The raw materials for manufacturing, crude morphine, were supplied by Wang and Chen. For each ounce of product, he charged Wang and Chen a manufacturing fee of 2.5 yuan. Since February of this year, he has supplied crude morphine more than ten times, with a minimum of 20 taels each time and a maximum of 70 taels, totaling about 50 times, with a total profit of 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Zhou E'xuan's Case Transferred to Local Court for Trial; Two Women Appear in Court to Testify to the Relationship between Zhou and Zhang; Zhou Files a Counter-Suit Against Zhang Zhuying for False Accusation <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Zhou E'xuan, the eldest son of Zhou Weishen, the owner of the Zhou Gengji store, a wealthy businessman from Suzhou residing in Shanghai, was sued in the First Special District Local Court by Zhang Zhuying for abandoning Da Yuan, a boy he had with Zhang in the past. After repeated interrogations by the court's primary criminal division, the plaintiff and defendant, as well as the child, were sent to the Forensic Medical Institute for examination. The examination revealed that Da Yuan's appearance was mostly very similar to Zhou E'xuan. Judge Wu believed that the circumstances of the case were very consistent with Article 310 of the Criminal Law and should be handled by the local court. Therefore, he ordered the defendant to post 20,000 yuan in cash as bail to await trial in the local court. Details have been reported previously. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan of the local court summoned both parties and witnesses, Fang Chen, Liu Wu, and others, to the court for interrogation. Attorneys representing the plaintiff, Zhang Shizhao, Xiang Xun, and Lu Mengfei, and attorneys defending the defendant, Wang Zijian, Huang Yinian, and others, appeared in court successively. First, Zhang Zhuying stated that when she was 18 years old, she went to the defendant's house with Fang Chen to participate in a savings club, and that was how she met the defendant. At that time, she was still a virgin, but she was repeatedly seduced by the defendant, who gave her a gold ring as a gift. Because she was young and ignorant, she had a physical relationship with him. On the eighth day of the seventh month when she was 21 years old, she gave birth to Da Yuan in a small house at No. 8, Xinglongfang. Unexpectedly, her parents-in-law found out a month later and suddenly came to the house and moved away all the furniture while she was out, and the family was dissolved. The defendant moved to the Xin Huizhong Hostel for about two months. The defendant said that he had a strict father and could not be with her for the rest of his life, so he ordered her to temporarily enter the world of prostitution. The child was raised by her mother's family in the countryside, and the defendant was responsible for paying the necessary living expenses on time. After she redeemed herself, the defendant still bore the cost of alimony and sent it every month. Until last fall, the defendant suddenly stopped paying, causing the child's life to suddenly become destitute, so she filed the lawsuit. Then, Fang Chen testified that the defendant sometimes came to my house to wait for Zhang Zhuying and gave her money. Liu Wu testified that Zhang Zhuying came to my brothel in the past and was introduced by Zhou E'xuan. Later, Zhou often came to the brothel to see her and often heard them talk about having a child and raising him in the countryside, and saw Zhang ask Zhou for living expenses for the child. However, Zhang was only in the brothel for two months before she redeemed herself, etc. When questioned, the defendant Zhou E'xuan still categorically denied living with Zhang and having a child, and filed a counter-suit against Zhang for false accusation, claiming that Zhang fabricated the facts. Judge Wu then continued to interrogate the false accusation part. After the interrogation was completed, he asked Zhou if he was willing to withdraw the counter-suit. Zhou said that if the case could be ended quickly, he would be willing to withdraw the counter-suit. The court then ordered the lawyers of both parties to begin the debate. After both parties had finished their arguments, the court announced that the sentence would be announced at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Four Kidnappers Sentenced to Death by the Provincial Government for Retrial; Investigation of the Case Still Required, Trial to be Rescheduled <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>In July of last year, the French Concession police sent detectives to Tianjin to arrest the kidnapping gang Zheng Tangsheng (local), Shang Zhen (Henan), Liu Yimin, Wu Shaoting (all from Yangzhou), and Geng Huatang (Jinan), a total of five persons, and brought them to Shanghai. It was found that from 19th to 21st year of the Republic, they had successively kidnapped Huang Yuyi, the deputy director of the Zhongnan Bank, Chen Yanghe, the deputy manager of the Siming Bank, He Shaoting, the owner of the Xin Senji Construction Factory, Huang Baohua, a dye merchant, Ze Lin, the son of Yunnan Division Commander Gu Zizhen, and murdered their accomplice Xiao Shaoxing. In the 18th year, they kidnapped Chen Zhuling and Liang Huiwu, compradores of Jardine Matheson in Tianjin, tore up the tickets and buried the bodies to eliminate traces. The case was transferred to the Second Special District Local Court for public prosecution. Except for Geng Huatang, who committed suicide in prison due to fear of punishment, the trials of Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Wu were concluded, and they were sentenced to death. After reporting to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for review, Zheng and the other four convicts refused to accept the sentence and hired a lawyer to represent them and submitted a petition to the Provincial Government requesting a retrial. The Provincial Government approved the request and returned the case to the Second Special Court for retrial. Two court hearings have been held, and details have been reported previously. Later, the court believed that the two cases of Chen and Liang being kidnapped and torn up in Tianjin must be investigated in detail, so it specially transferred the documents to the Tianjin Court for investigation. Now, it has received a reply from the Tianjin Local Court, issuing summonses and ordering the victims of the kidnappings in Shanghai to be summoned for trial yesterday. Zhu Dianqing and Fan Gang, the defense lawyers hired by Zheng and others, arrived at the court one after another at 2 PM yesterday to await instructions. At 3 PM, Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu, accompanied by Clerk Ren Qiwen, took the bench in the Fifth Criminal Court to hear the case. Attorney Fei Xizhen appeared in court on behalf of the police, and Detectives Qian Yumin and Cui Zhendong, who were responsible for handling the case, also arrived at the court to await questioning. After the judge opened the court, he ordered the bailiffs to go to the detention center to bring Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Wu to the case. After briefly questioning their names, ages, and native places, he summoned the witnesses, that is, the victims who had been kidnapped, but none of them arrived in court. Detective Cui Zhendong stated that after receiving the summons from the court, he immediately went to summon the victims. Huang Yuyi was said by the bank to be not in Shanghai, Chen Yanghe had returned to Ningbo, Huang Baohua had returned to his hometown in Jiangyin due to illness, and Gu Zizhen had gone to Hong Kong. Bailiff No. 292 stated that when he went to summon He Shaoting with the summons, the summons was received by his family members, etc. The judge ordered that the convicts be taken down and interrogated individually. They all denied all the kidnapping cases. At this point, the judge believed that the case still needed to be investigated, so he announced that the trial would be rescheduled. The defendants were still detained in the detention center.</p>
<h3 id="e150">New Standards for Tea Inspection to be Implemented Soon <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Inspection standards are raised year by year; coloring concentration is reduced year by year. The use of toxic colorings for tea is prohibited; it is advisable to use improved colorings for tea coloring.</p>
<p>The inspection standards for this year's exported tea and the measures for banning colored tea have been approved by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, together with the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau, and will be officially implemented from May 1st. The inspection standards are slightly higher than last year, and the standard concentration of colored tea is also slightly lighter than last year. The standard tea samples issued by the Ministry will be distributed to Chinese and foreign tea merchants immediately so that they can be followed. The tea inspection methods for this year are as follows: (A) Minimum inspection standards: 1. Green tea is based on Pingshui No. 2 Tea and No. 7 Pearl Tea; black tea is based on Hunan Sub-Red; other teas are based on comparable color and delicious taste. 2. The moisture content of red and green tea is based on 8.5%; however, this year, in addition to green tea based on the standard, black tea is qualified with 10.5%, and other teas are qualified with 12%. 3. The maximum ash content of red and green tea is based on 7%. (B) Measures for banning colored tea: 1. All merchants who report colored tea must use the fuel. 2. Tea that is colored too strongly, the same as or heavier than the specified coloring standard, is prohibited from being exported. 3. The use of toxic colorings containing metals such as lead, copper, arsenic, chromium, barium, and cadmium (such as the commonly used light yellow, three-fish yellow, Iki yellow, and sand green) and other inorganic or organic toxic colorings is prohibited from being exported. Article 3 of the above-mentioned measures for banning colored tea will be strictly enforced from this year. It has been found that tea coloring is already unhygienic, and the addition of toxic colorings further harms the drinkers and directly hinders the trade of Chinese tea. Therefore, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau decided to ban the malpractice of tea coloring from the beginning of tea inspection. Later, in consideration of business conditions, a gradual banning method was adopted, and three kinds of colored tea standards were formulated last year to show restrictions and prohibit the use of toxic colorings. On the one hand, experts have researched and created many improved non-toxic yellow colorings, which have now been successfully tested and manufactured by the Shanghai Tea Industry Association. Therefore, from this year onwards, if tea merchants have to color the tea, they should all use improved non-toxic yellow colorings, and the old inferior colorings are absolutely prohibited from being used again. If there is any violation, once it is found, the export will be strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>The China Jiseihui, because of the severe flood disaster in Chuansha County last year, publicly elected Mr. Mu Jialiang as the director, and jointly organized two relief efforts with the Chinese and Foreign Righteous Relief Association within the year, distributing relief rice, cotton clothing, cotton quilts, and bamboo for building sheds, totaling 4,000 yuan. It is planned to investigate the situation in the spring when the crops are not yet ripe and provide continued relief. Now, in the middle of spring, when the victims are without clothes and food, it is extremely pitiful. Therefore, 300 shi of relief rice has been organized, and Mr. Mu Jialiang and relief friends, Mr. Cheng Ruizhi, etc., are invited to investigate and provide relief. However, the disaster area is very tragic, and there are many victims, not just one or two places in Yuanyuansha, Chuansha. The association's financial resources are limited and cannot be universally relieved. Alas, there is nothing that can be done. It is hoped that charitable comrades will vow to save people. Being able to have even a spoonful of paste can save one more life. Saving people from death and bringing bones back to life, seizing this opportunity to form good relationships widely will bring immeasurable blessings.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Sentence Announced in the Zhengtai Factory Labor Dispute Case; Wang Yufu and Others Each Fined Ten Yuan <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Since the unprecedented tragedy of the boiler explosion at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory at No. 38, Dalian Bay Road last year, the factory has been sold to others. In addition, the Xinyi Company took over the management and stopped employing some workers. The workers demanded that the factory pay them layoff wages for six months and other benefits, but the factory refused, resulting in a labor dispute. At 4 PM on the 5th of the month, while the factory was starting work, a group of dozens of workers, including Wang Yufu, Chen Shuchun, Du Duzihui, Lu A'ming, Lei A'hong, Liu Rutian, Liu Xiangrong, Sun A'yuan, Zhao Heping, Wang Jinkun, Qin Linbao, and Gu Linchao Su Genyuan, rushed in and prevented other workers from working, and destroyed motors and machines. The factory reported to the police and ordered detectives to come and arrest Wang and others. Zhang Shizhu, the attorney for the police, filed a public prosecution based on Articles 318, 3822, and 320 of the Criminal Law, including obstructing freedom and damaging property. The First Special Court heard the case twice and ordered Wang and 13 others to each pay 50 yuan to be released on bail pending trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce continued the trial in the Fifth Criminal Court. Zhang Shizhu, the attorney for the police, stated that the charges under Articles 382 and 320 of the Criminal Law were private prosecution crimes, and now the Zhengtai Factory stated that it was unwilling to pursue the matter, so he requested that the prosecution of those two articles be withdrawn, and only the defendants be charged with the crime of obstructing freedom under Article 318 of the Criminal Law. Then, the defendants' attorney stated that the labor and management sides of this case had been mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau and were close to reaching an agreement, and mediation would be held again tomorrow, which might resolve the matter. When questioned, the defendants unanimously admitted that although they went to the North Thai Factory that day, they did not commit any violence. After mutual debate between the lawyers of both parties, Judge Zhan immediately announced the verdict: Wang Yufu and others jointly used violence and coercion to obstruct others from exercising their rights, each fined 10 yuan. If they were to be imprisoned instead of paying the fine, it would be calculated at two yuan per day. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized would be used to offset the fine at two yuan per day. The defendants all expressed their willingness to accept the sentence. Zhang, the attorney for the police, stated that whether to appeal was still under consideration and requested that the defendants still be placed on the original bail during the appeal period. The court approved the request.</p>

<p>The traffic departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways yesterday issued a notice to all stations stating: "To facilitate passengers purchasing tickets and boarding trains in a relaxed manner, after reviewing the situation, the ticket selling time at each station is stipulated to be clearly marked on the ticket windows (open all day), such as 'Open two hours before departure,' etc. Regardless of the ticket selling situation at each station, the current regulations must be strictly followed. However, it has been found that some ticket offices at various stations still do not open windows to sell tickets according to regulations, causing passengers to be extremely rushed and crowded, disrupting order, hindering travel, and causing complaints from the outside world, which affects both the reputation and business of the railway. All stations are urged to strictly comply."</p>

<p>Yang Shutao, an elderly man from Jiangbei, lived in a building in Pingmin Village, Quanjia'an Road, Hongkou. At the age of sixty-two, he started his business from peddling and working, viewing money as his life. He never had a family throughout his life. As he grew old, he worried about having no descendants, so he adopted Lin Guangcheng as his son, who had already become an adult. Later, due to a lack of mediation, he also cohabitated with an old woman named Lin Wu, who was over fifty years old. She brought a stepson, Lin Guangwen, who was also an adult. Yang was satisfied because he was rich and had everything, even though his wife and children were not formally recognized. However, misfortune struck due to the worship of money. His adopted son and stepson fought each other for rights, often engaging in internal strife. Yang suffered, but it was too late to regret. He was often distracted and suffered from nervous disorders. However, they did not understand him. A quarrel broke out again the other day, and the old wife sided with her son, making things difficult for Yang. Overwhelmed with anger and resentment, he decided to end his life. He hanged himself upstairs the night before. In the morning, Wen, the chief of the third precinct of the fifth district, learned about the incident. Believing that these people had driven the old man to death and that there must be a hidden story, he arrested them all. Yesterday, he ordered the bailiff Ling Renjie to report to the court for an inquest.</p>

<p>Xi Ziqing, a driver from Pudong working for Xiang Sheng Motor Company, was driving car number 18530 at 9:30 PM on the 13th of this month, carrying silk merchant Shen Xinsan. When driving east to west near Pingliang Road and Huinan Road, the driver carelessly hit an elderly man named Wu Laogao from Taizhou, causing fatal injuries. The Yangshupu Police Station immediately dispatched detectives to arrest Xi and send him to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the trial. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that during the investigation, it was found that the defendant did not turn on the headlights in the dark area at the time, did not honk the horn, and was driving fast, causing Wu Laogao to be knocked down and killed. The police have filed a public prosecution based on Article 291, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, for manslaughter due to negligence in business, and requested severe punishment. He submitted a drawing of the accident scene. Qian Chunxu testified that the deceased was his maternal uncle and that the defendant's car came from behind, leaving no time to avoid. A Western officer from station 44 testified that the defendant had driven on the wrong side of the road, causing the accident. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. The judge sentenced Xi Ziqing to six months' imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Gambling on a Lighter Exposed: Nine Gamblers Arrested <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the police authorities in both the Chinese and foreign concessions have been very strict in prohibiting gambling. However, gamblers often exploit the sphere of influence of Japanese businesses and organize gambling dens on land and water at the Dongyang Company Wharf in Hongkou (i.e., the Nippon Yusen Kaisha Wharf). On the water, a well-known gangster nicknamed "Little Tongzhou" is in charge, gathering gamblers on the decks of Japanese or Chinese ships docked at the wharf to gamble. When the liners weighed anchor, they rented big lighters and gambled in them. On land, a gangster nicknamed "Big Hair from Jiangbei" is in charge, gathering gamblers in the open space on the wharf every day to gamble in the open. This has been going on for more than a year. The water and land police in both the Chinese and foreign concessions have repeatedly arrested and punished them, but they are not afraid of the law and continue to gamble in public. Recently, the leaders Shen Wanshan, Huangyu, A Ming, Xiao A Lai, Xiao A Gen, and the Blind Man Xin Gen, and others raised capital of 5,000 yuan, divided into 100 shares, each share worth 50 yuan, and opened gambling dens day and night on land and water. Those addicted to the game of "Panlong" flocked to it, and the stakes were quite large. Yesterday, the gamblers rented a large lighter, covered it with tarpaulin on all sides, and docked it beside the Japanese ship "Ikoma Maru," gathering people inside to gamble. An official, a Westerner, happened to be inspecting the cabins on the Ikoma Maru when he saw the lighter looking suspicious, suspecting that it contained smuggled goods. He quietly pulled open the tarpaulin to peek inside and saw gamblers gathered, shouting and playing dice. He remained calm and secretly reported to the Minhang Road Police Station in Hongkou by phone. The detective immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to board the lighter and raid it at 4:30 PM. The gamblers tried to escape, but the Blind Man Xin Gen, Xiao A Gen, and others were arrested. Dozens of others escaped. The gambling equipment and money were taken to the police station and detained for investigation.</p>

<p>Ms. Gu Linyi, the wife of lawyer Tian Hemen, entered the Zhongde Obstetrics Hospital on July 30 last year to give birth. After childbirth, she suddenly suffered from dysentery. Dr. Yu Songjun of the hospital injected serum. Later, she changed doctors for treatment, and Gu passed away on August 16. Tian filed a complaint with the First Special District Court. The defendant, Yu Songjun, hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him. The court appointed Dr. Bao Ke of the Shanghai Union Hospital to conduct an appraisal. As a result, Yu was not at fault. The court then declared the defendant not guilty. Tian did not accept this and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, arguing that the examination report was forged and that Dr. Yu's failure to continue injecting serum was intentional negligence. The Second Branch of the High Court sent it to the forensic examination institute for scientific examination. The examination report was not forged. It was also clarified that the defendant did not continue the injection. Yesterday (the 18th), the court announced that the appeal was dismissed.</p>

<p>Deng Darong, a clerk of the former Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau, privately forged seals and misappropriated tax funds. After the bureau's chief accountant, Huo Pinfang, discovered this, he reported it to the ministry. The director, Wang Zongzhu, sent Deng to the court. The ministry successively sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the embezzlement. The evidence was conclusive. The business bureau of the Central Bank and the tax authorities were derelict in their duties, allowing Deng to continue embezzling for one year and eight months. Rationally and legally, both parties should be held responsible. The ministry has now ordered that if Deng Darong fails to return the full amount, half of it should be compensated and advanced by the supervisors and relevant personnel of the Unified Tax Bureau. The Ministry of Finance's instructions are recorded below: "Case review: Deng Darong, a clerk of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau, forged seals, fraudulently withdrew tax funds, and misappropriated them. This was previously reported to the Accounting Department of the Ministry by Huo Pinfang, the chief accountant of the bureau. Wang Zongzhu, the director of the bureau, submitted a detailed report to the ministry on the circumstances of sending the criminal Deng Darong to the court for investigation and handling. As this case was serious, the ministry repeatedly sent personnel to investigate thoroughly and report back. Later, Director Wang submitted a report on the case of the criminal Deng Darong, the circumstances of the judgment, and requested an investigation into the repeated illegal withdrawal of funds by personnel of the Central Bank's business bureau. The Central Bank also sent a letter in response to the ministry's request for verification. The ministry comprehensively reviewed the case. The Central Bank's business bureau did not distinguish between true and false when cashing Deng Darong's checks and paid them directly. The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau never reviewed and verified the reports and statements sent by the business bureau, allowing Deng Darong to continue embezzling for one year and eight months, accumulating a huge sum of more than 80,000 yuan. Rationally and legally, both parties were at fault. In addition to the business bureau being held responsible, the ministry has already sent a letter to the Central Bank to handle it accordingly. All lost tax funds should be advanced and compensated by the supervisors and relevant personnel of the Unified Tax Bureau by half if Deng Darong fails to return them or does not return the full amount. A copy of the Unified Tax Bureau's previous submissions and the Central Bank's official letter are attached (lengthy, omitted). This order is to be forwarded to the relevant departments for compliance. The supervisors and relevant personnel of the Unified Tax Bureau were negligent in their duties, and the relevant departments should consider the circumstances and propose appropriate disciplinary actions to be submitted for approval. This order."</p>

<p>Last month, thieves broke into warehouse E of the Blue Smokestack Wharf in Pudong and stole ten boxes of serge worth 15,000 yuan, totaling 52 pieces. The customs water patrol police successively arrested 14 original thieves and receivers, and recovered 44 pieces of the original stolen goods. The suspects were sent to court for investigation and handling. However, eight pieces of the original stolen goods are still missing, and the main suspect, Xu Gui, is still at large. Therefore, the detectives are still actively pursuing the case, and have also solved the long-standing unsolved case of the Zhanghua Woolen Mill's repeated theft of domestic woolen fabrics. It was found that all kinds of products produced by the factory were accumulated in the warehouse on the third floor of the Kenyie Bank on Suzhou Road. On June 13 last year, the iron bars of the warehouse window were sawn open, and ten pieces of gabardine, serge, etc., worth more than 1,500 yuan, were stolen. On February 5 this year, using the same method, three pieces of gabardine worth more than 400 yuan were stolen. On May 5, the lock on the main door was sawn off and gabardine, flannel, serge, silk pongee, etc., totaling 18 pieces, worth more than 4,000 yuan, were stolen. The factory had reported the losses and requested the Laoza Police Station to investigate, but after many days, there were no clues. Recently, the water patrol police received a confidential report that a tenant named Zhang Xinyou at No. 8 Yingping Lane, Fuyou Road in the city, often sold sporadic pieces of serge. Zhang claimed to the buyers that it was stolen goods from the Blue Smokestack Warehouse. It was learned that stolen goods were hidden in the house, and that Zhang Cai, the concubine living at No. 6 opposite, also took out serge from her house from time to time. The police then dispatched Chinese detectives Sun Agui, Huang Zhenlin, Yao Guofa, and Xu Juelu on the previous day to go to the address with the chief and sergeant of the second precinct of the first district to arrest Zhang. Seven pieces of whole serge and three pieces of cut serge were found in the two places. A document was then prepared to take the people and goods back to the police station from the Public Security Bureau. It was found that the serge was marked with the words "Zhanghua Product, Completely Domestic Product." Zhang confessed that he had stolen it from the Zhanghua Huo warehouse one after another, and it was learned that it was not related to the Blue Smokestack case. Personnel were dispatched to the Zhanghua factory to verify the facts. Due to jurisdictional relations, the detectives Xue Silin and Xu Lenian transferred the people and goods to the Laoza Police Station, which transferred them to the Special District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Nine Arrested Cadres of Wusong Machine Factory Released; Cao Wenkui Still Detained by Garrison Headquarters; Railway Bureau Orders Dismissal of Eight Arrested Cadres <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>After Cao Wenkui and other ten cadres of the Wusong Machine Factory Branch of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Workers' Union were interrogated by the Garrison Headquarters, the party departments and trade unions of the two railways tried to rescue them. It is reported that the other nine people besides Cao Wenkui were released yesterday. However, the Railway Bureau has ordered the Wusong Machine Factory to deal leniently with Chen Shusheng, who had a lighter offense, among the nine, and to dismiss the others who had more serious offenses. The original instructions are recorded below: "Case review: Instructions from the Management Bureau, Machine Department No. 121 open, the Bureau is implementing the Ministry of Railways' approved plan to improve the machinery affairs of this station, which is now being actively implemented. The recent repeated labor disputes at the Wusong Machine Factory have sharply reduced production efficiency. The director of the factory, Mao Erwei, is responsible for the mismanagement and ineffectiveness, and has already been dismissed. However, this Bureau is well aware that there are some bad elements among the factory's employees who have in the past repeatedly used the name of the Wusong Machine Factory Branch of the Railway Workers' Union to induce other workers with words such as maintaining the interests of the workers, claiming to be representatives of their unreasonable demands, or using the solemn weekly memorial service of the Premier to put forward improper discussions to incite the masses, and driving loyal workers to go beyond the proper boundaries, so as to violate the provisions of Article 2 of the Railway Employees Service Regulations, interfere with the Bureau's employment of personnel, violate the provisions of Article 4, interfere with the Bureau's administration, so that the Wusong Machine Factory Branch of this Railway Workers' Union has often directly issued written statements and other illegal acts to the outside world. The organization of the trade union, according to Article 1 of the National Government's Trade Union Law, was originally for the purpose of improving knowledge and skills, developing production, maintaining and improving labor conditions, and life. However, the actions of these workers clearly violate the original purpose of organizing a trade union, and the righteousness of the trade union has unfortunately been sullied. It is not only that the discipline of the Wusong Machine Factory has been destroyed, and production has therefore been reduced, but at the same time, ordinary, peace-abiding workers cannot work with peace of mind. The losses suffered by this road are also incalculable. Although this Bureau has been lenient in its administration, it is difficult to continue to tolerate this in order to realize the plan to improve the machinery affairs of this road as determined by the Ministry of Railways, and to rectify discipline. A thorough investigation should be conducted on the employees under its jurisdiction, and those who habitually violate the Railway Employees Service Regulations, violate the Trade Union Law, repeatedly cause trouble, are lazy in their work, hinder the work of others, and take too many leaves of absence should be punished separately, and those whose circumstances are serious should be dismissed and never hired again. The remaining workers, if they can abide by the law and work diligently, should still be given preferential protection and should not be implicated. This is of utmost importance. This order, etc. In addition to the workers who beat up Chen, the standing committee member of the Party Department, and the two engineers Qiu and Wang of the factory the other day, and the bad elements Tao Abao, Mao Rugen, Shu Benbao, Zhang Guilin, Yang Pingfu, Ying Juqing, Zhang Guanyou, and Wang Atang have already been ordered to suspend work in accordance with the Bureau's instructions, the Bureau has also instructed that according to the report, the workers Li Jinyuan, Han Weicai, Liu Jinlin, Xu Shanqing, Shi Zhenyuan, Tang Genfa, He Laixing, etc., who violated the Railway Employees Service Regulations and caused trouble in the work stoppage case last December, should be dismissed immediately. Ah Jin (i.e., Chen Shusheng) had a lighter offense, and should be given a major demerit and fined one month's salary, and placed on probation in the factory to see the effect. This is why we are informing you in a hurry, hoping that you will comply and forward the instructions as necessary. This is addressed to the Wusong Machine Factory."</p>

<p>The Yiji Qunle Shaoxing Theater, which is located in the Gonghe Rising Peace Tea House across from the Xiaocai Market in Gonghe Road, Zhabei, was performing "Nine Beauties" yesterday afternoon. An elderly woman from Suzhou named Gu Zhu, who lived at No. 17 Xingde Lane, Guangzhao Road, was 62 years old and loved to watch plays. She had lunch at home and arrived at the theater before 1:00 PM, before most of the audience. For some reason, the elderly woman fell on the escalator at the entrance of the upstairs. The performance had not yet started on stage. After being noticed, Ning Zhenlin, a police officer from post number 14 of the fourth district Public Security Bureau, was reported to come and inspect. He saw that the elderly woman was wearing black clothes and yellow leggings, and blood was flowing from her nostrils. There were no other injuries visible anywhere else, but she had already died. He immediately reported to the fourth district and summoned Gu Zhengfu, the son of the deceased, and Shi Jishun, the representative of the theater.

Now, Dr. Guo considers physiology, such as uterine retroversion, lateral deviation, cervical closure, etc., all of which can be filled with surgery. On the one hand, drug treatment is used to make menstruation smooth and harmonious. Therefore, patients often see results in three to several months. In addition, she is also good at treating related women's diseases, leukorrhea, prenatal and postnatal women's gonorrhea, and detection of poison and blood. The hospital has wards, which are unusually clean. Those who seek medical treatment all say that they are comfortable. Therefore, those who seek medical treatment are one after another. Dr. Guo also has an obstetrics department attached to the hospital. If you are hospitalized for childbirth, whether it is a difficult birth or a smooth birth, the medical expenses are very cheap, because she has the heart to help the world.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, Today's newspaper published a news item about our company's Minqiang ship running aground and sinking upstream of Yichang. We were shocked after reading it. All the details in the report are completely inconsistent with the facts. The Minqiang ship sailed to Qingtan this time, and due to the rapid water flow, the hull passed through the rocks and was scraped and slightly damaged. The company immediately sent the Minxian ship to help, transferring all the goods being transported to Chongqing. Both passengers and goods are safe and sound. The report in your newspaper is about our company's shipping reputation. We hereby write to you and hope that you will make a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Branch of Minsheng Industrial Co., April 18.</p>

<p>Answer: The "Second International," also known as the "Socialist International" or "International Socialist Party," was an organization formed by socialist parties of various countries after the dissolution of the "First International," due to the perceived necessity of international proletarian unity. It was initiated by the Belgian Labour Party in 1880, and after eight years and several provisional meetings, the first congress was held in Paris in 1889. The Second International had four factions: (1) the Right - composed of revisionists from various countries; (2) the Center - with Kautsky and others as prominent figures, nominally desiring revolution but advocating the union of all factions and concessions to the revisionists, thus advocating for incompleteness; (3) the Left - including Luxemburg and others, who were Marxists; and (4) the Extreme Left - i.e., anarchists. Although their advocacy was radical, it was impractical. The Second International had several major shortcomings: first, opportunism, recognizing that due to the exploitation of colonies by imperialists, labor and capital had common interests; second, overemphasis on democratic politics, considering the proletarian electoral movement to be very important; and third, loose organization and complex membership. During the European War, the socialist parties of various countries under the Second International supported fighting for their homelands, thus leading to its demise. It was restored after the European War, and a congress was held in Geneva in 1920, with members composed of the British Labour Party and the Social Democratic Parties of Germany, France, and Belgium. In 1923, it merged with the Second and a Half International, now named the "Socialist Labour International." Although it still has many member countries, due to the intensification of class opposition within various countries around the world, reformism can no longer liberate the masses from hunger. At the same time, the political crises of capitalist countries and dictatorial politics have become a unanimous demand among classes. The illusion of striving for "democratic politics" under the capitalist system is no longer supported by all classes and must inevitably be shattered. Therefore, the influence of the Second International has also had to weaken day by day.</p>
<p>(9) What does "unique scientific worldview" refer to? Is it the same as materialism? (Last line of page 22)</p>
<p>To understand the meaning of this sentence, one must first know what a worldview is. A worldview is a theory obtained by observing the world and the universe as a whole unified entity. Materialism, on the other hand, is a way of looking at the world and the universe, and in itself, cannot be said to be a "worldview." Therefore, "worldview" is not "materialism." The phrase "unique scientific worldview" that you pointed out means a worldview that uses dialectical materialism to observe the universe and the world. Because it is correct, it is called "scientific," and because the bourgeoisie is unwilling to adopt this view, it is called unique. Generally speaking, worldviews can be divided into two types: one is materialism, and the other is idealism. Idealists believe that in the relationship between thinking and existence, spirit precedes nature and exists first. Therefore, they take spirit as the essence of the world, denying the primacy of the material world, and even denying its existence. Therefore, the idealist's worldview starts with spirit, thought, the "self," or God, and the result of these things' activities is the world. Materialists, on the other hand, are exactly the opposite. They not only do not acknowledge that consciousness (i.e., spirit, thought, etc.) determines existence, but rather believe that existence determines consciousness. Therefore, the worldviews of materialists and idealists are completely different: one completely ignores material existence, while the other believes that the material world exists independently, and the human worldview is a reflection of the material world in human consciousness. Dialectical materialists not only acknowledge that the objective world can determine human survival, but also that humans have the potential to change the world.</p>
<p>(10) Is "Marx En says" a misprint? (Line 96 of page 20) Answer: Yes, the character "En" should be "Si". (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e187">Contributing to Domestic Goods Factories and Foreign Trade <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Recently, the Dutch East Indies implemented regulations restricting the import of Japanese cotton cloth, which dealt a great blow to Japanese merchants and provided a good opportunity for the promotion of domestic cloth in our country. According to Mr. Qiu, a cloth merchant in Batavia, domestic cloth has many shortcomings. If domestic manufacturers can improve these, selling to Southeast Asia will not be difficult. Mr. Qiu mentioned seven shortcomings:</p>
<p>(1) Domestic goods cloth is mostly woven based on the needs of people in the country, and many do not meet the needs of foreign sales.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic goods factories lack an international perspective, and their views on the sales of various goods are based only on subjective opinions.</p>
<p>(3) Domestic manufacturers often treat foreigners as rare goods, and only care about small, immediate profits for all export goods, without long-term vision.</p>
<p>(4) Domestic goods factories have too little capital, and require cash for foreign sales. Competing with Japanese cloth, which is cheaper and sold on credit, is naturally inferior.</p>
<p>(5) There is a lack of domestic ships, resulting in foreign merchants controlling the right to transport goods. For example, 46 cubic feet of cloth, transported from Hong Kong to Batavia by a Java Company ship, a sea voyage of over 1,300 nautical miles, requires a freight charge of 13.5 Dutch guilders. If a Japanese ship is used, transported from Japan to Batavia, a sea voyage of over 2,300 nautical miles, each ton of cloth only requires 9 Japanese yen, and during competition, it has even been reduced to 5 yen.</p>
<p>(6) Chinese merchants suffer great losses due to the lack of bank drafts. For example, when Japanese goods are shipped, the Yokohama Specie Bank provides drafts at a rate of only 0.5%, while shipping goods from Hong Kong or Shanghai requires drafts from banks such as Banque de l'Indochine and Anderson, Meyer &amp; Co., with interest rates of at least 0.9%.</p>
<p>(7) There is no domestic insurance company to insure transportation, resulting in many losses. For example, insurance from a Japanese insurance company costs only 2.5 Japanese silver coins per 100 yen. If goods are shipped from Hong Kong and insured by a foreign merchant, the cost is at least 1 Chinese dollar per 100 yen.</p>
<p>This passage is not only for cloth factories, but also for general domestic goods factories in our country. Therefore, although there is an opportunity to sell domestic cloth to Southeast Asia, in fact, if there are no improvements in the above seven points, there is still little hope. I sincerely hope that the financial, transportation, and insurance industries will pay attention to this issue, work together to solve these many difficulties, and provide a way out for domestic goods manufacturers to engage in foreign trade. In particular, I hope that domestic goods factories themselves will be sure to investigate the market, customs, preferences, and needs, study the psychology of foreign consumers, and strive to improve the manufactured goods. By having a broad vision, not being greedy for small profits, and using this spirit and energy to compete with foreign merchants, it may be possible to gain a foothold on the international commercial battlefield.</p>
<p>National Development Talk</p>
<h3 id="e188">Let's All Be Fools <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Qiao Jianhua</p>
<p>In this day and age, most women of middle to upper-class status consider "clothing" to be the most important of the four necessities of life. The materials used for clothing, from underwear to outerwear, total more than ten types. Just taking the overcoat as an example, it has become increasingly popular in recent years, truly creating a huge business for foreigners.</p>
<p>Looking back at the women of ten years ago, only a few daughters of wealthy families wore overcoats. People of the middle class could not even dream of it. Now, almost everyone has an overcoat. Moreover, having a winter overcoat is not enough; overcoats must also be worn in the spring and autumn. This fashion has spread from prosperous Shanghai to the interior. If we were to tally it up, the number would be quite considerable. If everyone who wears an overcoat used domestic wool fabric as the material, then it would not be a bad phenomenon. However, that is not the case. Clearly, imported wool fabric is still increasing, while domestic wool products are still rare and struggling to survive.</p>
<p>Recently, I received further evidence that proves that my sisters' support for "promoting" and "boycotting" at the National Goods Movement meetings is mostly just talk. This is because I recently could not resist the urge to have a spring overcoat made. I ran to many clothing stores and asked them for a domestic overcoat. They all said in unison that they did not have one. And if I wanted to have one made, they could not even find the material. But in the windows were all kinds of fashionable imported goods, perhaps even enemy goods, made into overcoats for less than 20 yuan each. It is said that most of them already had customers. When I walked out of the store in grief and anger, they said that they had never seen a "fool" like me.</p>
<p>Finally, I spent 40 cents on transportation to go to the National Goods Department Store and bought a piece of wool fabric to have a truly domestic overcoat made. Calculating the cost, the price was indeed more expensive. But wearing it, I felt much more comfortable than when wearing foreign goods, without being tormented by my conscience.</p>
<p>Sisters! The purpose of wearing an overcoat is simply to keep warm. If we only focus on appearance, then when the country is destroyed and our homes are gone, and we become slaves of a conquered nation, we will still strive to be unattractive. I hope that everyone will "foolishly" save the nation!</p>
<h3 id="e189">Progress in the National Mentality <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese people mostly took pride in buying imported goods, but now they have progressed. They all feel ashamed to buy Japanese goods. I went to a relative's house on Laobaidu Road, where there was a Japanese Industrial Cooperative Company. I asked my relative: "Does that company have many Chinese customers?" The relative said: "Not a single one. Chinese people are unwilling to go in. It is entirely maintained by Japanese people."</p>
<p>I also went to the China National Goods Company on Nanjing Road and saw people going in and out, laughing and chatting, with national goods in their hands. I couldn't help but quietly shout, "The Chinese people are awakened!"</p>
<p>The second thing is that in my school, two years ago, most of the students in my grade used Waterman brand foreign ink. The number for all schools in the country was quite alarming. Moreover, this ink was also more expensive than ordinary ink, about 40 cents. Now, however, that is not the case. Except for a few people, everyone uses ink produced by Chinese factories. The most popular is Minsheng brand.</p>
<p>In the future, I hope to see further progress. It is said that the Japanese living in Shanghai eat and use everything brought from their own country. We live in our own country, so why do we still use foreign goods?</p>
<p>National Goods Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e190">Several Serious Problems in the Future of National Goods <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>In this noisy clamor of promoting national goods, although we hold an optimistic attitude towards the future of the "Women's National Goods Year" because it has already gained the enthusiastic support of many women, and are filled with joy, believing that the revitalization of national goods is promising, we must turn around and start from another perspective. Has the angry tide of failure in the national goods production industry subsided and completely disappeared? The facts show us that at present, which of the yarn factories, silk factories, and flour factories are not on the road to decline, lifeless? The cries of "suspending work" and "reducing work" are disturbing our ears. In terms of the phenomenon and trend, it is so bad. This is the most serious period for the national goods industry, and I think no one can deny it. Furthermore, we must know that it is caused by both internal and external pressures before we can devise appropriate countermeasures. Now, I dare to raise a few points for discussion, and hope to obtain a quick solution.</p>
<p>A. Regarding external aggression: 1. The United States raises silver prices. Because the world economic panic is deepening, the great powers are also trembling with fear. At the same time, overproduction and sluggish sales make the capitalist countries of the world have to think about using various dumping policies to monopolize the markets of other countries. What will be the impact of the United States raising silver prices this time, thinking of using the convenience of exchange rates to dump on our country's market and attack the future of our production industry? 2. Large-scale dumping of enemy goods. Currently, the "Yellow Peril" is more serious than "floods and wild beasts." The dumping of enemy goods is a serious problem. They are now using organized and planned strategies, combining politics and business, and attempting large-scale dumping. Needless to say, this will affect the future of domestic products.</p>
<p>B. Regarding internal strife:</p>
<p>(1) Strikes occur frequently. During the National Goods Year, the factories themselves often have labor disputes. This is originally a weakness. Just consider that strikes, work stoppages, reduced production efficiency, and hindered progress of national goods are extremely harmful.</p>
<p>(3) Infighting and price-cutting competition among the same industry is the most distressing thing in our country's market. Now, because the market is not good, prices are even lower, and inferior goods are produced, materials are cut, and reputations are ruined, which is becoming extreme.</p>
<p>In short, our country's national goods production industry is still in its infancy and cannot withstand these storms. However, the points I have mentioned above must of course be resolved appropriately first. As for how to solve this problem, I dare to quote Madam Cai Yuanpei's words, "It is human nature to love cheapness. To save the current crisis of the national goods industry, in addition to the unity of the people themselves, we really need political power to deal with it." I will end this article with these few words.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Wake Up! <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>Wake up!</p>
<p>You are indulging in meaningless vanity, taking "imported goods" as "modern" and treating the alarming trade deficit as nothing.</p>
<p>Wake up!</p>
<p>You are being suppressed by economic aggression. The ferocious powers seek market monopoly. "National destruction and family ruin" may be the epilogue of "dumping."</p>
<p>Wake up!</p>
<p>You are about to become criminals of society, delighted to use foreign goods and despising domestic products. Who is responsible for the outflow of thousands of dollars?</p>
<p>Wake up!</p>
<p>The past mistakes are not worth worrying about. Future efforts are still possible. We will move towards a bright future in this way, completing the important mission of this "Women's National Goods Year."</p>
<p>National Goods and Rural Areas</p>
<h3 id="e192">National Goods Should Be Promoted in Rural Areas <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Bochen</p>
<p>After the military leader called for the New Life Movement, the response from all over the country followed one after another. Looking back at the promotion of national goods, we are constantly shouting loudly and decisively. Various newspapers have published special publications and written propaganda to urge the Chinese people to wake up. But what are the results? It really makes people sigh after hearing it!</p>
<p>According to the investigation and newspaper reports last year, imports of foreign goods exceeded 90 million yuan. According to the February report this year, imports of inferior wool fabrics have exceeded last year by six times. Studying its causes: In big cities, most young men and women are prone to worshiping modernity and have the bad habit of liking to use foreign loans! In the interior, rural areas have long been bankrupt, and inferior goods take advantage of this and vigorously implement dumping policies in bankrupt rural areas.</p>
<p>It is a pity that the honest and simple farmers do not have the ability to distinguish. They only know to be greedy for cheap prices and compete to buy! General treacherous merchants change their appearance, only being greedy for profitable opportunities. Where do they care about the patriotic duty? Therefore, every year, inferior goods can still be active in the mainland market!</p>
<p>Now, national goods should be promoted in rural areas, to wake up the farmers to the dangers to the country of loving foreign goods! And it is necessary to make the farmers have the ability to distinguish. It is best to urge each township head to set up several consumer cooperatives, so that after the farmers enter the market, they buy all national goods. After they get used to it, they will naturally buy national goods next time.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Rural Women and National Goods <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Ying</p>
<p>In recent years, the National Goods Movement can be said to have been promoted with all our efforts in the cities. Even in various cities, there are often gatherings and parades promoting the movement, such as lantern festivals and makeup speeches, which are often seen in newspapers. On the contrary, the rural areas, which account for more than 80% of the country's population, are always being ignored and no one cares. Everyone always thinks that the countryside is a remote place, and the villagers are accustomed to being frugal and using mostly national goods.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>They think, 'What is foreign goods? What is domestic goods?' As long as one person promotes it, everyone will follow suit, and once they start using it, it will not be easily removed.</p>
<p>Since the situation in rural areas is like this, despite the National Goods Movement in the cities making a lot of noise, if we still hold a neglectful attitude towards the rural areas, we will not be able to achieve the greatest effect. Therefore, now the promotion of the National Goods Movement, especially starting with the rural areas, the most concrete way is to have teachers in rural elementary schools or township heads lead, and hold lectures and propaganda at any time, or organize a National Goods Consumption Association, so that rural women can also fully join, the most important thing is to enable them to recognize and distinguish between genuine and fake national goods, so we should also often hold something like a rotating exhibition, on the one hand, to make them recognize clearly, on the other hand, to let them know the harm of buying foreign goods, will they not be wholeheartedly happy to use national goods?</p>
<p>Notes from Visiting Talk</p>
<h3 id="e194">Notes from a Visit to the China Industrial Gas Refining Company Product... Oxygen Nitrogen Carbon Light Carbonic Acid Gas Uses... Industry Military Medicine, etc. <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>China Industrial Gas Refining Co., Ltd. is the newest enterprise run by Chinese and the first factory to manufacture industrial gases. Its products include several types of gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and light carbon dioxide. The factory is located at 537 Liaoyang Road in this city. Having heard of its name, the reporter went to visit. Its methods are novel, and its scale is grand. The reporter was cordially received by Mr. Guo Boliang, the chairman of the company, and Mr. Li Yuancheng, the manager. Here is an abstract of the question and answer between the reporter and Mr. Li at the time:</p>
<p>(Question) How are all the products of your company used in industry? (Answer) Oxygen and light carbon dioxide are mostly used in metal welding and cutting projects. Oxygen and carbonic acid gas have the effect of reviving the dead in medicine. Nitrogen is the main component of chemical fertilizers and various explosives. The above various gases are of great importance in industry. (Question) What are the dangers of your work? (Answer) Refining oxygen, carbonic acid gas, nitrogen, etc. all require extremely high pressure. Those who are not rich in experience often have the risk of explosion. If light carbon dioxide is accidentally mixed with air between 2.6% and 81%, a spark or vibration can cause an explosion. Therefore, various countries have strict regulations for the manufacture of various gases, so that they can be followed. Regarding light carbon dioxide, governments of various countries have restricted the pressure not to exceed 15 atmospheres when bottling at the Geneva Conference to prevent danger. However, in Shanghai, it is often relaxed to 25 atmospheres, which is really dangerous. (Question) What is the economic value of oxygen? (Answer) Since the method of refining oxygen has been gradually improved, the quality is pure and the price is low. The precious product of the past is now a necessity. Therefore, its uses are also expanding day by day. National defense, medicine, chemical industry, and various manufacturing industries all use it. Even the brewing of alcohol and the melting of glass cannot be done without oxygen. In addition, the use of oxygen is quick, saving labor and costs. For various emergency repairs and demolition, the welding project that used to be difficult to start can now be solved easily. The world-shocking German pocket battleship, whose full ship displacement is limited by treaty, the Germans want to reduce the weight of the ship's hull, its structure does not use rivets but gas welding, that is, use the displacement saved by this to install heavy artillery. Among the Chinese warships recently built from foreign countries, gas welding is also used. As for aviation equipment and boat building, oxygen is needed when flying high. The Chinese people should be able to recall the January 28th Incident in this city. The Japanese once planned to use poison gas to help fight. If this matter is actually implemented, then oxygen is an indispensable product for combat. If you do not seek it externally, you will be bound to die. A country that manufactures oxygen factories and relies solely on foreign supplies will not be able to survive in the world. (Question) To what extent has oxygen been used in our country? (Answer) In commerce, the largest use of oxygen and light carbon dioxide is for metal cutting and welding. The industrial sector of our country is still in its infancy today with the use of oxygen. Scrutinizing its cause, it is mostly because the supply of oxygen products has always relied only on foreign goods, monopolizing and hoarding is unavoidable. The Chinese people have suffered its pain for more than a day. My company and colleagues have deeply considered that in the long run, how can industry develop? So, they jointly set up China Industrial Gas Refining Co., Ltd. with users. This industry is still unprecedented in our country. (Question) What is the impact on the market after your company produces it? (Answer) My company has been preparing for several years before it started producing last winter. Its oxygen content is purer than foreign goods. It has been certified by chemical testing agencies to reach 99.8 degrees. Light carbon dioxide is also more beautiful than foreign goods, and the pricing is low. Because the products of my company have come from behind, foreign goods are rarely asked. Therefore, the price has fallen frequently. Now it has been reduced by more than half compared with the previous market price. (Question) How are the sales of oxygen, etc. in this city? (Answer) According to the investigation, the annual sales of oxygen and light carbon, etc. in Shanghai alone is worth more than 1 million yuan. In the past, foreign goods were completely sold. Now, after the products of my company, the sales are very strong. Even foreign-run businesses, such as this city's water plant, power company, old dock, and Hong Kong American naval shipyard, etc., have successively purchased them because of the good quality and low price of my company's products. It is estimated that the road of my company's products has accounted for half of the foreign goods. In the past, one million yuan was all a leakage. Now, because of the replacement of domestic goods and the low price of foreign goods, the outflow of interests and rights is only 250,000 yuan per year. (Question) What is the important relationship between gas and engineering? (Answer) The quality of the gas and the cost savings of the project are indeed closely related. According to the report of those who use domestic oxygen, the same project can save gas by 10% to 40% by using domestic oxygen compared with foreign oxygen. My company has now made a dosage table based on the results of the test, which calculates the quality of the gas and the amount of usage, and lists the ratio, as attached. For example, to cut a copper plate 60 inches long and 1 inch thick, only 226 liters of oxygen from my company's products are needed. At the same time, if</p>
<p>Purity of Oxygen (%) 99.7 99.4 99.1 98.9 96.9 95 90 87 85 82.5</p>
<p>Increase or Decrease in Dosage (liters) 226.5 249.2 277.5 320.3 374.4 436.5 566.6 652.7 730.804</p>
<p>The dosage of oxygen with a purity of 95%, which is commonly seen on the market, will increase to 436 liters, which is an increase of more than 80%. Therefore, the value of oxygen should be judged high or low according to its purity. If users want to save labor and costs, they can calculate according to the above table and get it with one request. (Question) According to Mr., since your company's products have been released, foreign goods have been greatly affected. If foreigners use their means of economic aggression to cut prices and dump goods, can your company insist to the end? (Answer) This point should be worry-free. The product of the gas industry is needed by the country in this world, and its talents require specialized skills, which cannot be cultivated in a short period of time, and cannot be lacking for a day. Therefore, in the West, the government must be the backing. Now, the products of my company have also been protected by the government of our country. They are mostly sold for our country's industry, and ordinary users also buy them in droves in order not to allow monopolists to reappear, in order to show their love for my company. As far as the current situation is concerned, although there is no profit to be said, if the help of society can improve day by day, the use of daily expansion, and the output increases, the cost may be reduced with the sales, then my company can still compete with foreign goods in the long run according to the initial purpose of my production and sales cooperation, and why worry about the failure of the business. You must know that the price of foreign goods sometimes or cheaper than the price of domestic goods, how can we invest ourselves in the snare of the dumpers for the current benefit of a fraction of a penny, so that domestic goods are overwhelmed by them, and make the pain of hoarding and monopolizing worse?</p>

<h3 id="e204">China Race Walking Association Prepares for 50,000-Meter Walk – Committee Meeting Held Yesterday to Determine Training Steps <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (17th) at 7:00 PM, the China Race Walking Association held a committee meeting at its headquarters in the Moore Memorial Church on Xizang Road to discuss the continued progress of the 50,000-meter race walk and to schedule the 4th Annual Open Competition for Men and Women. The following seven committee members were present: Shi Youhui, Zhou Yuyu, Zhang Zao Cun (representing Zao Jiu), Shi Jinsheng, Zhang Zao Jiu, Yu Zichen (representing Zhang Zhihe), and Lu Yutian. Shi Youhui presided and Lu Yutian recorded the minutes. The chairman began by reporting that since China participated in the annual International Race Walking Competition in Shanghai, it has won the championship for six consecutive years, which is a source of pride for our country. The National Sports Association believes that China has considerable strength in race walking and has been allowed to participate in the 11th World Games in Germany. Hao Gengsheng, the inspector of the Ministry of Education, has repeatedly expressed his opinion that race walking and weightlifting are the two events in which China has a chance to participate in the next World Games. The Association has been actively working on this since last year and has established a research committee specifically responsible for arranging a three-year plan, practicing step-by-step, and completing the 50,000 meters (slightly over 31 miles) by the end of this year. However, this is a major undertaking that requires national mobilization to achieve perfection. He also stated that although there is considerable awareness of race walking in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Jinan, and other places recently, and race walking has been included in competitions, it still feels that it is not yet widespread. It is necessary to expand publicity in the future to achieve good results. Then there was a discussion, and several items were resolved. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Continue to proceed according to the predetermined three-year plan and complete 50,000 meters by the end of this year, and practice the full course throughout next year. (2) Due to climatic conditions, slight changes have to be made. It is now decided to complete 17 miles by the end of May this year, 20 miles by the end of June, 23 miles by the end of September, 25 miles by the end of October, 28 miles by the end of November, and slightly over 32 miles (50,000 meters) by the end of December. (3) The 17-mile route remains the same. For 20 miles, starting from Card Road Jing'an Temple Road, to Hongqiao Road, turn into Zhongshan Road, Longhua Road, Jinyi Road, Wenlin Road, to Xiafei Road, west to Haige Road, Baisai Zhong Road, Maiqi Road, to Beidang Road, east again along the original road, to the intersection of Ma Huo Road and Weihaiwei Road. 23 miles, 25 miles, 28 miles, 31 miles, etc., will be published later. (4) Due to the long distance, all participants who join the practice should ask their own guides to take care of them along the way to avoid accidents and to report the distance and time at any time so that they can move forward. (5) It was decided to hold the 4th Annual Open Competition for Men and Women on November 4 this year, with 13 miles for men and 2 miles for women, held at the same time. (6) In order to popularize race walking skills and cultivate talents, a training class will be set up, which will be the responsibility of the Research Committee of the Association. It is said that the class will start in early next month. Groups can send letters to the Association to send instructors. (7) Consider sending representatives to participate in performances at sports meets in various provinces and cities to promote and promote. (8) Submit a letter to the National Sports Association to be forwarded to the Ministry of Education for approval to list race walking as a formal event and to submit it for discussion and participation in the competition at the next Far Eastern Games Executive Committee meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Lafayette Defeats Shell Three Times <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The Lafayette football team accepted the challenge from the Shell football team, a Western team known for its strength, at the football field last week. The Shell team's strength was exceptionally strong. It had joined various cup games in the Western Union Group A competition last season and had excellent results. The Lafayette team members were mostly veterans of the battlefield, and their coordination was like a living dragon and tiger. The two sides were evenly matched and refused to give in to each other. After ten minutes of mutual combat, Luo Douwen took the opportunity to dribble the ball forward and powerfully crossed the ball. Zhang Zhifang and Guan Zhixin understood each other and headed the ball into the net, opening the scoring. Later, the Shell team's inside guard touched the ball with his hand, and a penalty kick was awarded. Jiang Chao lightly kicked the ball and it went into the net. After losing two goals in a row, the Shell team launched several attacks. The Lafayette team's goalkeeper saw the fierce attack and was startled, losing three goals in a row. The Lafayette team swallowed its anger and dared not show weakness, launching an attack on the enemy. The five forwards surrounded and shot from all directions. Zhang Zhifang was ambitious and scored four goals in a row. The ball situation suddenly became one-sided. As a result, Lafayette won 7-4. On the 22nd of this month (Sunday), at 3:00 PM, Lafayette will accept Shell's challenge again and compete at the Chinese Football Field.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Peking University Professor Dispute – Lin Sun Resigns Due to Conflict of Opinion with Hu Shi – Major Changes in the Department of Chinese Literature – Hu Will Also Serve as Director <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) Lin Sun, a professor in the Department of Chinese Literature at National Peking University, suddenly resigned, which has attracted great attention in the education sector. The inside story is complicated and is the result of years of accumulation at Peking University. Lin sent a letter to Jiang Menglin, the president of Peking University, and Hu Shi, the dean of the College of Liberal Arts, and announced to the students that he would resign voluntarily and left a farewell poem to the students, lamenting his suffering. Jiang issued a statement yesterday denying the merging of departments. Lin also expressed his opinion. The situation of each party is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Jiang Menglin: To President Jiang Menglin, since you came to serve as president of this school, it has been a long time. The students have accused each other, and I dare not speak out, but the school administration has become increasingly hasty, using shameless hearts and cunning tricks. I am very saddened by this. I have been serving as an official, but have failed to meet expectations. Please allow me to leave from here. I wish you all the best. Lin Sun.</p>
<p>Letter to Hu Shi: To Hu Shi, your feet, Sun and your feet are like Shi Le to Li Yang. Iron horses and golden swords, respected fists and poisonous hands, are subtly hidden in the text. I recently heard that you have done something else. Life in this world is as fleeting as dust. How can I care about trivial matters? After reading Buddhist books, I understand the cause and effect. Buddha has nine sufferings, and I have suffered them all. A professor's position is like chicken ribs. What is the pity of abandoning it? Respectfully avoid the path of the wise and report to the wise. Lin Sun.</p>
<p>Notice to the Students: To all the students who come to study, I, Lin Sun, will immediately stop working voluntarily. All those who have selected courses, please continue to study on your own and do not waste time, in order to live up to my usual expectations. This is my sincere prayer. Lin Sun respectfully.</p>
<p>Farewell Poem to the Students: In the end, I let Wei deceive the Buddha, it is difficult to find an iron heart. Deep worries and many strange dreams, accumulated habits send out crazy chants. Earnestly receive the advice, and the remaining feelings are deep in the sea. Alas, under the human footprints, neither beast nor bird.</p>
<p>Lin Sun's Statement: The reporter specially visited Lin Sun, a professor in the Department of Chinese Literature, to inquire about the reasons for his resignation. According to him, the reason for my resignation is that I have different opinions on academics from Shi Zhi (Hu Shi, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts), not a difference in political views. I am a professor, and professors teach books, and each has his own theories. Stay if you agree, leave if you disagree. In fact, I and Shi Zhi have not been on the same path for a long time. This time, I resigned entirely because I was in a bad mood. As for the merging of departments, it is a matter of school administration and is not a concern of the professor.</p>
<p>Jiang Menglin's Statement: The reporter also visited Jiang Menglin, the president of Peking University, to inquire about the facts. According to him, the rumor that our school is merging departments is unknown from where it came. The organization of Peking University will never change. The rumor of merging departments is not true. Lin Sun's first resignation is true. This is a kind of misunderstanding. The faculty of the Department of Chinese Literature at Peking University will have some changes next semester. This is a personal problem, not an organizational problem.</p>
<p>Students' Attitude: Ten students from the Department of Chinese Literature went to Lin's residence at 4:12 PM today (17th) to visit Lin and asked him to cancel his resignation. Lin replied that his resignation was irreversible and that he could only appreciate everyone's sincerity. The students repeatedly requested that he return to school to teach as soon as possible for the sake of the students' studies. Lin advised the students not to try to persuade him to stay. The two sides talked for a long time, but there was no result. According to the students, we went to Lin's residence to persuade him to stay based on personal opinions and did not bring official documents. After the Department of Chinese Literature holds a general meeting in the future, we will formally visit Lin again and request that he not resign.</p>
<p>Hu Also Serves as Director: Since Hu Shi, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Peking University, returned to China after attending the Pacific International Relations Conference last year, he has continued to serve as Dean, but he has not been fully responsible. Now Peking University has decided to reform the Department of Chinese Literature. The director of the department, Ma Youyu, feels deeply troubled and also intends to resign. After Ma's resignation, the Peking University authorities decided to continue to hire Ma as a professor. The position of director will be filled by Hu Shi, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts. In fact, Dr. Hu will not decline this position.</p>
<p>Internal Scope of Reform: According to those familiar with the inside story of Peking University, since Jiang Menglin became the president of the school, he has indeed intended to reorganize the Department of Chinese Literature and reform the curriculum. Because reforming the curriculum involves personal issues, Lin Sun was the first to resign. The school authorities expressed regret at Lin's resignation. There is no way to deal with a resignation in the middle of the semester. Professors in the Department of Chinese Literature have different opinions on Chinese literature. Now the curriculum will be changed, and the director of the department, Ma Youyu, does indeed have difficulties. As for the other departments, there will be no reform. There will be no changes in the Law School or the School of Science. The rumor of merging departments is not true. Tao Xisheng's Statement: The reporter visited Tao Xisheng, a professor at Peking University. According to him, the rumor that Peking University is merging departments is not true. It is true that the Department of Chinese Literature is being reformed. According to my speculation, the budget of the Department of Chinese Literature is relatively large, and there may be some changes next semester. I have not heard of the inside story of Mr. Lin's resignation. (Jin)</p>

The original provision of 1.5 staff members per class will necessitate a reduction of one person per school. In terms of compensation, the teaching hours for subject teachers and class teachers will be increased (subject teachers to 1400 minutes, class teachers to 1100 minutes), while salary standards will be lowered. Consequently, all teachers and staff of municipal schools have convened and elected a delegation, formulating "Proposed Amendments to the Draft Regulations on Appointment, Treatment, Service, Rewards, and Punishments for Elementary School Teachers and Staff in Beijing submitted to the Bureau." Representatives have been selected to petition the Ministry of Education and the Beijing Municipal Government. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Proposed Amendments</p>
<p>The original document of proposed amendments submitted by the teachers and staff is lengthy. The main principles are as follows: (1) The salary standards for elementary school teachers and staff in Beijing formulated by the Social Bureau should be premised on improving the welfare of all teachers and staff. (2) Municipal complete elementary schools and compulsory elementary schools have different structures and natures; regulations should be formulated separately. (3) Seniority increments and reward methods should be formulated separately. (4) The salary standards for teachers and staff in municipal schools should not be lower than their current actual salaries. (5) Teacher and staff salary standards should be based on their education and experience. (6) The standards for teacher and staff promotion should not have too many levels or too long of a duration. (7) The ratio of school class size to the number of teachers and staff should not be less than the current ratio. (8) Teacher and staff teaching hours should not be increased. The proposed revisions are as follows: (1) The minimum salary for teachers and staff who meet Article 75 of the Elementary School Regulations should be 65 yuan for principals, 60 yuan for directors, and 55 yuan for class teachers and subject teachers. For those who meet Articles 78 and 79 of the Elementary School Regulations, the minimum salary should be 60 yuan for principals, 55 yuan for directors, and 50 yuan for class teachers and subject teachers. (2) Teacher and staff salary increases should be in increments of five yuan, not reduced to three yuan or two yuan. (3) Past service experience of teachers and staff in municipal schools should be recognized. Those who have served in this city for every two full years should be promoted one grade and paid accordingly; those who have served in other locations for every three full years should be promoted one grade and paid accordingly. (4) Teacher teaching hours should be revised to 810 minutes per week for intermediate and senior class teachers, 900 minutes for junior class teachers, and 900 minutes for subject teachers. (5) Complete elementary schools with six classes should have three directors; those with eight classes should add a research director. The minimum number of teachers and staff should be in accordance with the standards stipulated in the actual expenditure budget for the 21st year. (6) Those with six classes or fewer should still have one clerk, with a minimum salary of 36 yuan, without the need for examination and certification. (7) Teacher leave should be handled by the principal; if the principal's leave exceeds three days, it should be submitted to the Bureau for approval and record. (8) Female teachers' maternity leave should be limited to two months, with full salary paid by the competent Bureau as a preferential treatment. (9) If a teacher or staff member becomes ill due to overwork and is diagnosed by a doctor as requiring more than half a month to recover, the salary of the substitute teacher should be disbursed by the Social Bureau. (10) Children of municipal school teachers and staff who are also serving concurrently or retired and are studying in municipal primary and secondary schools should be exempt from tuition fees. (12) Please add provisions for teacher and staff professional development and vacation methods in accordance with the Elementary School Regulations.</p>
<p>Petition to the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The eight people elected by all municipal schools, including principals Zhou Juzhuang and Zhang Shaoping, went to the Ministry of Education last Friday, the 5th, to petition. A staff member of the General Education Department received the representatives and explained that the Ministry was reviewing the revised standards proposed by Beijing and had discussed the matter with Director Wang of the Social Bureau. He said that if the new regulations required principals to also teach classes (previously principals rarely taught; the new regulations require principals to teach a certain number of minutes depending on the number of classes, which municipal school teachers and staff did not object to because it conforms to the Ministry's regulations), and the three directors of general affairs, academics, and discipline to also teach classes, then one person would be reduced from each school. With 39 schools in the city, 39 people would lose their jobs. Director Wang stated that new schools would be added after the summer vacation to accommodate them, and there was room for discussion on funding. The Ministry of Education will pay attention to the requests of the municipal schools when reviewing the standards, he said.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The eight representatives of Beijing municipal schools went to the Municipal Government again this week (the 17th) to present their opinions. Secretary Xiong received them and replied that if there was an opportunity for reconsideration, the various opinions would be revised within the realm of possibility, with three points: (1) The number of teachers could be stipulated according to the current situation. (2) The time spent teaching courses could be reduced if it did not violate the Ministry's order. (3) Compensation could be increased appropriately depending on the Municipal Government's financial resources. The representatives also met with the Director of the Social Bureau, whose responses were similar to those of Secretary Xiong. It is reported that when the principals of various Beijing schools held a meeting on the 18th, there was also discussion, with all contributing opinions, clarifying the rising cost of living and the actual difficulties, and requesting adoption of their suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="e212">High School and Above Graduates Must Undergo Three Months of Military Training; Training Methods Still Being Compiled and Reviewed, Implementation Possible in the Second Semester of This Year <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang believes that military training in high schools and above has been neglected. In order to actively rectify this, he recently telegraphed the Training Supervision Department, ordering the re-compilation of military training methods. After receiving the order, the Department formulated a training plan and submitted it to Chiang for review. The content is that graduating students from high schools and above must undergo three months of military training before the Training Supervision Department can issue a certificate. However, junior high schools are not included because of their younger age. As for the training locations, they are concentrated in three places: Luoyang, Nanjing, and Hankou, covering eight provinces: Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shandong. Hankou governs Jiangxi and Hubei provinces, Luoyang governs Henan and Shandong provinces, and Nanjing governs Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian provinces. However, this has not yet been replied to by Chairman Chiang. It is also understood that the training methods are still being compiled and reviewed and will be completed soon. After the completion of these methods, they must be reviewed by Pan Youqiang, Director of the National Military Training Education Department, before being submitted to Chairman Chiang for review and approval. It is expected to be implemented in the second semester of this year.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Fourth District Education Association Founding Meeting <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Held yesterday afternoon at McLaren Middle School</p>
<p>The Fourth District Education Association of this city was originally established in March of the 20th year. However, it was affected by the January 28th Incident, and the members dispersed. The first session of executives also did not have a sufficient legal number of members and failed to hold elections on time. Therefore, in September of last year, the Municipal Party Department sent personnel to reorganize it. Now that the reorganization has been completed, the members' meeting was held at McLaren Middle School on Zhaofeng Road yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Zhu Jiaxiang, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, Ding Shoutang, a representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, Ma Jiazhen, a representative of the Municipal Education Association, and more than 80 members attended the meeting. The presidium was comprised of Hao Naiding, Tong Zhiji, and Shen Ding. Formalities were observed. First, Chairman Shen Ding reported on the reorganization process. Then, Zhu Jiaxiang, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, Ding Shoutang, a representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Ma Jiazhen, a representative of the Municipal Education Association, delivered speeches in succession. Then, elections were held. As a result, Shen Ding, Tong Zhiji, Dai Yuheng, Zhou Shuzhuang, and Li Nianqu were elected as executives, and Feng Xiancheng and Chen Qide were elected as alternate executives. Finally, case reviews were discussed: (1) The proposal that the association should establish a member employment introduction department. (2) The proposal that the city's education funding should be independently operated and should be expedited to achieve its realization. (3) The proposal that the association should establish public schools and supplementary schools as much as possible in order to popularize social education. All of the above cases were handed over to the executive committee for discussion.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Current Situation of Secondary Education in England (Part 1) by Zhu Zhensun <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>We usually know that there are about nine famous public middle schools in England, namely Winchester, Eton, St. Paul's, Westminster, Harrow, Charterhouse, Rugby, Shrewsbury, and Merchant Taylors. But obviously, these nine schools cannot fully supply secondary education in England. So what other secondary schools are there? What do they rely on to maintain themselves? What are their curricula, teachers, teaching methods, etc.? These are the questions we want to study.</p>
<p>In the past, the power of private educational institutions in England was quite large, but the methods of maintaining these institutions were very complicated, resulting in great confusion in the English secondary education world. However, the situation has changed somewhat in recent years. Most of the secondary schools in England are now maintained and managed by the government. For example, in London there are more than one hundred secondary schools (enrolling more than 45,000 students) that are all managed by the government.</p>
<p>The level of secondary schools in London is the same as our junior high schools and high schools. But the difference is that they only recruit the best students. Other students with poor grades all go to private preparatory middle schools, industrial schools, central schools, and advanced elementary schools. The compulsory education age in England has now been extended to 14 years old.</p>
<p>(2) Teachers, Teaching Methods, and Equipment</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of teachers, great attention is paid to it. Although they are not as strict as in Germany, the standards are often quite high. For example, teachers who teach foreign languages must have studied abroad for many years and have a deep understanding of the foreign language. Otherwise, they cannot obtain the position of foreign language professor. When it comes to teaching methods, they all pay attention to practical application and experiments. Because the English do not like empty talk, they only know how to bury their heads in hard work. Among the teaching methods of various subjects, the one generally considered to be the most outstanding is the teaching method of foreign languages. When they teach foreign languages, they all use the direct teaching method. Students have made significant progress. The direct teaching method is used simultaneously in middle schools and central schools. As for equipment, great attention is also paid to it. For example, in Highbury Middle School in London, the equipment for physics and chemistry is unusually complete, and other books and instruments are also very rich. Unfortunately, the equipment for biology is not satisfactory.</p>
<p>(3) Curriculum</p>
<p>The organization of the curriculum in modern English middle schools is quite different from that of other countries. We can see the difference by looking at the curriculum organization of two middle schools. For example, the curriculum of Wandsworth Middle School is promulgated by the Ministry of Education. Male students in public middle schools from the ages of 10 to 19 can adopt them. The content of the course is very broad, including a common curriculum and an advanced curriculum. The common curriculum, on the one hand, can provide a foundation for a complete education, and on the other hand, is quite suitable for the standards of the London University General Entrance Examination. This common curriculum includes the following subjects: (1) Bible (students can choose to read it freely), (2) English grammar, (3) Composition and literature, (4) History, geography, (5) Basic mathematics, (6) Physics, (7) Chemistry, (8) French, (9) German and Latin, (10) Drawing, (11) Gymnastics, (12) Woodwork (13) Music. The higher curriculum is provided for students to prepare for higher subject examinations in universities, or examinations in arts, science, commerce, and engineering, university scholarship examinations, civil servant examinations, and civil service examinations in the London County Council. Advanced curriculum students can choose from the common curriculum subjects or from economics, economic history, economic geography, engineering drawing, and pattern making subjects according to their individual needs for further research. Let's look at the curriculum of Highbury Middle School again. It also includes the following subjects: (1) Bible (students can choose freely), (2) English and literature, (3) History, geography, (4) French, (5) Latin, (6) Mathematics, (7) Physics, (8) Chemistry, (9) Natural studies, (10) Art, (11) Woodwork and model building, (12) Singing, (13) Gymnastics.</p>
<p>Because Highbury Middle School does not have an advanced curriculum, many students have to stop their advanced research. But this number is very small. It only accounts for 10% of the students who pass the university entrance examination. Therefore, students who pass the university entrance examination are still allowed to enter the university, but those who work for scholarships, or do research outside the school to save money, or those who want to obtain honorary degrees from the University of London are exceptions. In ordinary middle schools in England, there are no industrial and vocational courses. Industrial and vocational courses are only available in specialized schools. But many middle schools pay great attention to commercial knowledge. Some schools offer as many as 16 commercial subjects. (4) Tuition Fees</p>
<p>The fees charged by various middle schools in London are inconsistent. The number by which they differ from each other each year ranges from about four pounds ten shillings to sixteen pounds. Here is a brief list of the fee situation of several schools for reference: (School) (Boys under 12 years old) (Boys 12 years old or older)</p>
<p>Highbury Middle School 9 pounds 10 pounds</p>
<p>Wandsworth Middle School 10 pounds 10 shillings 10 pounds 10 shillings</p>
<p>Streatam Middle School 12 pounds 12 shillings 15 pounds 15 shillings</p>
<p>In Wandsworth School, if two or more brothers are paying students at the same time, after one year, each brother only needs to pay seven pounds per year. All day students uniformly pay 43 pounds per year. All expenses for books, stationery, and sports and game admission tickets are included in this number.</p>
<p>Not every student in secondary school pays tuition because 25% to 40% of students enjoy scholarship rights. The London County Council has established 20,000 scholarships of different natures, but most of them are used in secondary schools. Therefore, there is often competition in secondary school examinations. If the student's parents' income is reduced to 250 pounds per year, the student's scholarship not only covers his tuition fees, but also increases them by 21 pounds per year to cover their family's living expenses. If the student's parents' income increases to 450 pounds per year, then they cannot enjoy the above rights.</p>
<p>In London's secondary schools, the average cost of higher education per student is 39 pounds, and tuition fees account for one-third of it. The average annual public expense enjoyed by fee-paying students in middle schools is twice that of students in elementary schools or central schools. This point is not noticed by ordinary people in general.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Fragrant Notes from the Imperial Incense <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This was also predetermined... The train had to get her permission before each departure... Although the train's stops were sometimes necessitated by actual needs, the drivers could not help but make some decisions themselves, but this was only an exception. Furthermore, she repeatedly warned that under no circumstances were whistles allowed on the locomotives, nor were bells allowed at the stations.</p>
<p>Because the journey to Fengtian this time was indeed much farther than the one to Jehol, she had to try this novelty. When she was young, people who saw this kind of train would all be surprised by its spiritual strangeness! No one would believe that this thing could be convenient for people! Now, she actually tried something that she considered absolutely impossible when she was young, and this thing carried her from the railroad to Fengtian, wasn't that an unbelievable miracle?</p>
<p>However, she still brought her carriage, thinking that this novel and doubtful method of shortening the distance might encounter some obstacles halfway.</p>
<p>(3) The Good Fortune of the Stoker and the Driver</p>
<p>Before the Empress Dowager boarded the train, there was one more thing that had to be noted. In fact, it was also a very stubborn habit. That is, whenever the imperial presence visited any building, the first person to walk in must be herself; if someone was already inside, that person had to retreat first, and only after the Empress Dowager walked in could the others follow. Therefore, before the Empress Dowager boarded the train, someone first drove all the workers on the train off the train, led them to a place out of sight of the Empress Dowager, ran neatly, lowered their heads, and waited quietly for her old self to board the train (14)</p>
<h3 id="e222">Spring in Jiangwan <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Xizhang</p>
<p>The sunlight shone on my face, warm and gentle like cotton. The willow breeze gently blew into the hearts of every person, and everyone seemed to feel drunk as if they had drunk a glass of brandy, no, their hearts, maybe! On Xiangyin Road, on the banks of Songhu Road, two or three female students, showing half of their jade arms, and two faintly visible peaks of their breasts stood high in front of them, walking and laughing, sometimes interspersed with a few formally dressed male students, between their eyebrows, there was filled with the breath of spring, intoxicated in the arms of the spring god!</p>
<p>The train carried batches of tomb-sweeping guests from the atmosphere of the city. They carried paper money and grass mounds, and once a year they went to worship the tombs of their ancestors very sincerely. When I looked at the people coming and going to sweep the tombs, I couldn't help but think of the martyrs who sacrificed for the country in the "January 28th" incident. In this Qingming season, when "every family burns white paper on their graves," whose lonely and desolate tombs of the martyrs will they visit?</p>
<p>In this spring-troubled season, I don't know how many heartstrings of lonely people have been broken, but I also don't know how many love buds of affectionate couples have sprouted. Hey! Spring God! What exactly have you brought? Is it sweetness? Or bitterness?</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Blue-Eyed, Blonde-Haired Long Serpent Formation <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Jinyang</p>
<p>In Suzhou, this was truly an unprecedented spectacle!</p>
<p>About a week ago, three hundred and some sturdy legs, three hundred and some rubber tires, formed a long serpent formation, winding and meandering along the station road, beside "Tiger Hill," near "Ruiguang Pagoda," and in front of "Tiansci Village," flying and rolling past! This human-powered rickshaw team, with over one hundred and sixty vehicles connected end to end, stretched for more than a li (about a third of a mile), entering "Jinmen" and exiting "Pingmen," almost circling this beautiful city of Gusu!</p>
<p>In each rickshaw sat a blue-eyed, blonde-haired foreigner, wearing a dark blue uniform and a white cap. Occasionally, there were a few elegantly dressed women and children of their own kind. They had unloaded their weapons on the warships in the Huangpu River and carried with them only large and small camera boxes. Moreover, almost everyone was waving a small wheat straw fan, just brought back from Tiger Hill.</p>
<p>The people of Suzhou are not exactly bumpkins. There are many foreign residents here, so the people of Suzhou certainly would not stare in astonishment at a so-called "foreigner."</p>
<p>However, a "foreign navy parade" like this, longer and more impressive than even a funeral procession, was indeed an unprecedented sight in Suzhou, and quite a spectacle.</p>
<p>An investigation revealed that this large group of visiting sailors were from the American navy stationed in Shanghai. Arrangements had been made in advance by the Navy Y.M.C.A. on Sichuan Road in Shanghai and the Suzhou Y.M.C.A., and many Chinese and foreign staff members were specially assigned to be responsible for reception and guidance. The number of sailors totaled one hundred and fifty-seven. A large number of rickshaws were hired in advance at a cost of one dollar and forty cents each. The scenic beauty of Gusu, known to the world as "Paradise," was captured in their cameras within a day. That night, these large groups of tourists filled the "Lengxiang Pavilion" with the spring breeze they brought, smiling and waving goodbye to Suzhou like the Amitabha Buddha in the Arhat Hall of "West Garden."</p>
<p>Last year, when dredging river mud, three people competed in the same spot, and as a result of the competition, they not only gained little but also ended up fighting and scattering. This year, we cooperated hand in hand and achieved unexpected results, so every event, when progressing in an orderly manner, will be successful.</p>
<h3 id="e224">On Conversation <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Leshan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read an article in this publication entitled "How to Converse," and I couldn't help but be moved by it. So, despite my inadequacy, I'd like to join in the fun and say a few idle words.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen said, "There are people who have ideas in their hearts but lack the words to express them. They want to speak but cannot utter a word. These people can be considered the most pitiful in the world!"</p>
<p>In fact, these people who "cannot utter a word" suffer from an inherent defect and cannot be helped. They can neither blame heaven nor resent others. What I find most embarrassing and frustrating are those who have unhindered eloquence, who can speak volubly, but are forced by circumstances not to dare to open their mouths. And those whose words are impassioned and whose rhetoric amazes their audience, also make them remain silent like cicadas in winter, not daring to discuss anything, even when they are concerned about the difficulties of the times, they can only grieve in silence and cannot express their suffering like a mute eating Coptis chinensis. Alas, these are the truly pitiful people in the world who lack freedom of speech!</p>
<p>"Calamity comes from the mouth," "Eat more, talk less," has been true since ancient times, and it is even more so now. In these times, a careless word can often lead to death. It is better to remain silent like those who "cannot utter a word" than to talk too much and ruin things, so as not to cause any trouble or disputes!</p>
<p>Yes, "the art of conversation is a practical need, an indispensable need," but we Chinese people, lacking other abilities, have made great progress in the art of conversation. All bad things can be spoken of in a way that sounds very good.</p>
<p>It is clearly about preserving the strength of a private army and refusing to fight the enemy, but they will cleverly create a pretext, calling it "non-resistance." It is clearly about being greedy for life and afraid of death, retreating in the face of battle, but they justify it as "shortening the front line" and "luring the enemy deep."</p>
<p>It is clearly about illicit affairs, but they put on a bold face and cover it up with grand words: "freedom of love," "practicing cohabitation of love."</p>
<p>It is clearly about selling off stagnant goods or mixing in inferior goods with changed labels, but they beautifully call it "sacrificing capital for a big price reduction." Alas, judging from this, how can we say that the art of conversation of us Chinese is not highly developed?</p>
<p>Correction: In the last three lines of the "Touring Gear" section of last Saturday's Spring Excursion Special, "荷之以扁" (hé zhī yǐ biǎn, carried with a flat object), "扁" (biǎn, flat) is a misprint for "肩" (jiān, shoulder). In the last line, "自爲恩物" (zì wéi ēn wù, regarded as a gift), "自" (zì, self) is a misprint for "目" (mù, eye).</p>

<p>Other Famous Inkstones</p>
<p>Tongque Tile. The Tongque tiles of Yezhong. Although some consider them unworthy of esteem because they were built by Cao Man, the quality of the tiles is fine and delicate, and the manufacturing is more refined than that of the Weiyang Palace. Therefore, later generations regard the broken bricks and tiles they obtain as treasures. The "Four Treasures of the Study" states that the potters who made the Tongque tiles used finely filtered mud, filtered several times with fine kudzu cloth, and mixed it with walnut oil, which was not something other tiles could match. The back shows the texture of coarse cloth and has the Jian'an reign year mark. Tao Bi's poem says, "Refining away the dregs of sand and stone, shaping clay into gold and jade," praising its solid quality. The Tang Records state that the tiles of the terrace were often broken, and occasionally there were complete ones, boiled with asphalt, which could be used for grinding ink. Enthusiasts especially loved their antiquity. Cai Tie's letter states that the old tiles of the Three Terraces of Yejun were valued for their antiquity, and their color was somewhat blue, with thick, flat, and smooth bodies, and ancient script surnames. All of this is sufficient to prove that Tongque is superior to Weiyang. The Tongque tiles made in Xiangzhou were particularly famous during the Tang and Song dynasties. Their method of manufacture was roughly the same as that of Chengni, but there were many counterfeit products. Ou Records states: "The ancient tiles of Xiang are indeed good, but few are genuine. This is because genuine tiles are decayed and unusable, and the world only values their name." Later generations even made fake ancient tiles out of mud, buried them in the soil for a long time, dug them up, and carved them into inkstones, saying, "This is an ancient tile from Xiangzhou." Most of what is circulating in the world now is like this, so there is even less to discuss. Su Records states that fake tiles were made in Daming and other places, which shows that the imitation of ancient tiles was not limited to Xiangzhou at the time, and the well-made imitations were actually difficult to obtain. Tan Yuan states that Xu Xuan obtained a Tongque tile and found that it leaked as soon as he poured water and tried to grind ink. Xuan Yuan said, "Is the Tongque thirsty?" Li Hanlao's poem says, "The songs and dances of the Wei Palace have long turned to dust, and several generations of potters have been seen again. The Tongque does not sing but only quenches its thirst, what crime has Guan Cheng committed to be suddenly tonsured," referring to this, which is also enough to prove that counterfeit inkstones are bound to leak water. In general, when researching tile inkstones, those that are coarsely made and shoddily manufactured, and whose fakes are obvious at a glance, need not be discussed. But if they are genuine ancient tiles from before the Tang and Song Dynasties, they must have a certain characteristic expression. Huang Shi's "Guest Record" states that there are three tests for Tongque tiles: tin flowers, thunder patterns, and fresh blemishes. "The carvings of wind and rain cannot be faked." This statement is truly the only way to study tile inkstones. All those with blue tin flowers, ancient cloth grain, and mottled and colorful appearances, presenting a natural and ancient meaning, cannot be faked. Han Weigong's poem praising tile inkstones says, "Mossy spots enter the bone and are still dry and verdant, raindrops stain and leave traces like new," which is the most appropriate description of ancient inkstones.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 27: The boudoir complaint secretly dissipates, the kind heart forgets leisure, the past events are hard to feel after being drunk.</p>
<p>When I think back to when I was a child, getting new clothes and new shoes, with lucky money in my pocket, running and jumping around, it was so much fun. So, when the weather turned cold, as soon as December arrived, I looked forward to the New Year every day, the sooner the New Year came, the better. But now it's different, knowing that growing older by a year, I'm very afraid of the New Year coming. But being afraid doesn't help, the New Year will always come. In the blink of an eye, youth has passed, and no career has been achieved. Guizhi smiled and said, "Are you going to become a monk because of this? Just taking Haidian as an example, there are many people who are not as good as Second Master Gan. Should these people all become monks? Then, I'm afraid it will become a world of monks." Jizhi walked back and forth on the road, and also laughed, saying, "You can't say that, everyone's situation is different. Young people only need spiritual comfort, and they don't care about hunger or cold. I always feel that nothing in this world will go my way. Alas!" As he said these words, he kept shaking his head, and sighing repeatedly. Guizhi, seeing his situation, what was there that she didn't understand, so she silently leaned against the door frame, not saying anything more. Jizhi still had both sleeves clasped and was pacing on the road. Guizhi's heart was originally very peaceful, without any other thoughts. Regarding Gan Jizhi as a person, she would definitely not have any attachment. But since he was pacing like that in front of the door, if she first avoided going inside, it would seem impolite. So she could only force a smile and stand there all the time. Jizhi started walking from his own doorway, passed Guizhi's gate, passed four or five households, and then walked back again. He walked back and forth like that, not knowing how many times. He lowered his head, looking at the ground, not looking at Guizhi, nor looking at anything else</p>
<p>, just walking like that. Seeing him like that, his heart must be extremely troubled, he had something to say, but he couldn't say it, the bitterness was in his heart, and he couldn't find a solution. (365)</p>

<h3 id="e228">The Liquefaction Festival in Rapolla <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Zongrong</p>
<p>Ding-dong! Ding-dong! Dang!... Dang!... Ding-dong!...... A burst of chimes emanates from a towering church. In front of the church gate, which is adorned with very beautiful iron railings, countless men, women, young and old, are constantly crowding inside. The interior of the church is extremely magnificent. At this time, it is already densely packed with people. Those coming in from the back can only see the altar. The backs of the men and women sitting or kneeling on the rows of chairs in the middle cannot be seen! But they keep pushing forward. It is always difficult for those standing in front to keep their feet firmly planted. They are pushed closer and closer to the railing in front of the altar. Those buried in the crowd feel that they are being squeezed tighter and tighter, and cannot move freely. At this time, only the tall and long-bodied benefit.</p>
<p>The altar is brightly lit with candles. The high priest is wearing gold-embroidered vestments that look like two pieces of tortoise shell on the front and back. Two boys behind him are holding his robes, attending to his kneeling and standing. He is holding some kind of rod in his hand, waving it to the left, waving it to the right, and waving it in the middle. The music is buzzing and humming... On the railing mountain, on both sides of the altar, there are rows of priests dressed differently from usual, singing and stopping from time to time, presumably following a certain ritual. Every few minutes, the high priest takes down a glass bottle about the size of a wine flask from the altar and tilts the mouth of the bottle downward in the light. Half of the bottle near the bottom is an opaque congealed substance. Although the other half has spots, it can transmit light. The high priest's repeated action is like a magician showing the audience "there is no trickery here," as if he is about to conjure up some wondrous scene. So the gathered heads compete to see, while the devout men and women repeatedly make the sign of the cross on their chests and murmur incantations, looking very pious.</p>
<p>But after half an hour, an hour... the bottle remains the same, and the voices in the church become somewhat agitated. After a long delay, suddenly a corner starts with a chorus of "pigs!" - "stinking goods!" -... the whole body responds, so it becomes a complete mess, and several old women also sob and yell along with them... "Pigs!... Stinking goods!... Not... giving... us... the... manifestation! Oh!... How... unfortunate!..." While this is going on, the high priest is still very calm, only turning the bottle more diligently, and the priests on both sides are still singing from time to time. Suddenly, the congealed substance in the bottle softens. It flows... Ah!... Ah!... A joyous cry shakes the ears! At this time, many men and women busy themselves with making the sign of the cross and reciting incantations. "What exactly is going on? Don't keep us in the dark." Someone must be asking this question as they read this.</p>
<p>This is the great festival of the Liquefaction of the Blood of Saint Gennaro in Rapolla, a famous seaside city near a volcano in Italy. According to legend, Saint Gennaro was martyred in Pozzuoli in 305 AD. When he was thrown to the wild beasts, the wild beasts retreated, and as a result he was killed. Later, when his body was moved to Rapolla, a bottle of his dried and congealed blood was also preserved in the city's main church. During the welcoming ceremony, the dried and congealed blood in this bottle turned into liquid, like fresh blood, as soon as it touched the hand of the Archbishop Saint Severus. Since then, this miracle has been shown once a year at the main church or the Church of Saint Chiara, on the first Saturday in May or September 16. The residents of Rapolla believe that when the city is in danger, they can also request the miracle to be displayed. If they don't get it, they scold him angrily, blaming him for being the city's main god and not fulfilling his responsibility to protect the people. If they get it, they cheer and pay their respects. This is truly a strange custom!</p>
<p>That superstition and childishness have reached this stage in civilized Europe, in Italy, the mother of European civilization, is indeed somewhat astonishing. No wonder organizations like the Chinese Tongshan Society and publications like spiritual magazines are everywhere!</p>

<h3 id="e230">The Unique Skills of the Chinese (Continued) <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Yiren</p>
<p>I found a corner in the lower cabin, which was the place where the stewards gathered. A lower bunk had an old steward lying sideways smoking opium. The lamplight illuminated his sunken cheeks and smooth, raised cheekbones, shiny and glossy. I watched his whole body's muscles contract convulsively as he took a deep puff. After taking that puff, I saw the superb technique he used to make the bubble. He simply didn't use any copper coins at all. He just used a pair of skillful hands and ten nimble fingers, very quickly, very skillfully, very skillfully, and very comfortably turning, twisting, and moving. Compared to the two women mentioned earlier, his technique was a hundred times higher!</p>
<p>I left the cabin, went around the bow, and facing the walkway with the door open, was the small living room of the cashier. A cashier's clerk was lying sideways on the bed inside, with sunken eyes and a row of uneven black teeth showing through a few sparse whiskers. A rosewood plate was placed on his chest. In addition to the very polite smoking utensils, there were also a teapot and a cigarette stand on the plate. He had a lit cigarette in his mouth, pinched a pipe in his left hand, and used a needle in his right hand to pick up a large piece of opium paste and burn it over the lamp. The more the opium paste burned, the more it melted and expanded, and the longer it hung down. He kept burning the opium paste as much as possible until the opium paste hung down, about five or six inches long, stuck to the tip of the needle, only as thick as a hair, and at the moment one-hundredth of a second before it was about to fall, he flicked the needle with his finger. The opium paste then formed a round, large bubble on the tip of the needle. He then inserted the needle into the hammer of the opium pipe and pulled out the needle. A very round bubble was placed right in the center of the hammer. He took the cigarette out of his mouth with his right hand and put it on the cigarette stand. The opium pipe pinched in his left hand was then stuffed into his mouth. He sucked hard, as if he wanted to suck it to the end of his internal organs. Then, as soon as he pulled out the opium pipe pinched in his left hand, the mouth of the teapot held in his right hand was inserted into his mouth again. His technique was truly wonderful, to the extreme!</p>
<p>The Chinese have some unique skills that people of all races in the world cannot match. These unique skills, once promoted by the government or praised by foreign gentlemen, can progress to the extreme. For example, "national martial arts," which has had a real effect in saving the country, and "national products," which have added to the country's glory at the Berlin exhibition......</p>
<p>And so on, are all very obvious examples. Although the wonderful skill of making opium bubbles is of little benefit to saving the country and has small flaws in strengthening the race, it is still a skill worthy of admiration! China, with these admirable skills, can indeed be proud! (End)</p>

<p>— Zhou Lengqie</p>
<p>At dawn, my wife was groaning in bed, and the people in the hospital were busy running around, because a small life was about to come into the world.</p>
<p>I paced alone outside the door, my heart filled with excitement and anxiety. On the one hand, I was worried that my wife's weak body could not withstand the pain of childbirth, and on the other hand, I was deeply afraid that the child would be in danger in my mother's womb, because we had all been hoping for a child to fill the deficiencies in people's lives for a long time.</p>
<p>All kinds of sounds echoed in my heart and ground my heart, and there was only one hope in my heart: I hope both mother and child are safe.</p>
<p>Finally, the "gugu" cry came out of the room. A big stone fell from my heart, and I ran into the room in three steps and two steps.</p>
<p>The room still retained the messy scene of childbirth, but the child had already been swaddled by a nurse. When she saw me, she smiled and hugged it over and said, "Congratulations! Congratulations! A baby boy."</p>
<p>I took the child from her hand, looked at the child's delicate face, and looked at the dawning light outside the window, and couldn't help but feel a slight joy in my heart. This joy was not because a boy was born. In this era, the traditional concept of valuing boys over girls, although it still exists in the hearts of some old people, does not exist in my heart. I only rejoiced that there would be another warrior in the future society. In addition, it was a kind of hope born out of disappointment with modern women, that a large number of male warriors would be produced to make the world change as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I carried the child to my wife's bed. Although my wife had experienced a lot of pain during childbirth, her body was still very healthy, and her appearance was also plumper than the last time she gave birth. When she saw me carrying the child over, she smiled and told me to put him in her quilt, and at the same time told me to go and rest. She obviously never forgot me for a moment, and she was more concerned about my body than about the child. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e232">On Physical Education <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Dun Pang</p>
<p>When it comes to emphasizing physical education, Sparta must be mentioned. The "Lycurgus Constitution" stipulates that after a man is born, he must undergo a physical examination. Those who are weak are abandoned in the mountains, and those who are healthy are raised by their parents until the age of seven. After the age of seven, they enter the national education institute and receive hard education based on forging. At the age of twenty, they join the army and concentrate on learning military skills. In the event of war, they must prepare to go to battle. After the age of thirty, they become warriors and are allowed to marry and return to private residences. For women, a strong body and a brave spirit are the main virtues of women.</p>
<p>Let's not care about Sparta's purpose in implementing this kind of physical training, and its methods may be too strict, restricting the freedom of the people's spirit, and not worth learning from. However, one point is very worthy of our attention, that is, what the "Lycurgus Constitution" pays attention to is the soundness of the entire nation, not the deformed development of a few people. In history, the fame of many nations is often due to the heroes produced in this nation. Sparta had no special heroes, but it was a great nation, because when it comes to heroes, every one of its people was a hero.</p>
<p>Since China was stigmatized as the "sick man of East Asia," it has gradually known to pay attention to physical education. Today, on the surface, the results of physical education are not bad. Sports meets are held every year, and each school has athletes. Even in international sports meets, we have long had athletes to show their skills. However, in reality, everyone knows what's going on. Not only is the real situation in the sports world infuriating, but even the general public's sports spirit is harmed by these "athletes." Look at the sports fields of various schools today. Besides a few pursuers of championship trophies using their strength, who else is doing reasonable exercise? Aren't most of the students haggard and pale?</p>
<p>I heard that Lianhua Company recently released a film called "Sports Queen," which satirizes sports movements focused on winning trophies. I haven't seen it, so I don't know what the content is.</p>

<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>The mountain path was steep and rugged, which was expected, but the road on West Tianmu Mountain was truly too treacherous. Because on one side was a clear stream winding through countless bends, and on the other side were strangely shaped, towering rock cliffs, it was impossible to carve a path on either side. Therefore, this winding sheep's intestine path made of fine stones and giant rocks could only wind around treetops and pass through mountain recesses. We felt that sitting in the sedan chair was endangering our lives in three ways, so we stubbornly told the porters to put down the chair, and still, imitating the poet's behavior, slowly chanted and leisurely stepped up the mountain. However, this chanting eventually turned into panting, which was a bit embarrassing to admit.</p>
<p>Supporting ourselves against the wall, following the stream, lifting our feet and bending our waists to go up, we passed Five Mile Pavilion and Seven Mile Pavilion. The higher we climbed, the denser and taller the trees became, and the rocks appeared higher and more bizarre. The climate also became very cold. The trunks and needles of the willow fir trees, which were abundant on West Tianmu Mountain, still had traces of accumulated clouds, and the rocks were covered with crystal-like ice streaks. Especially below Lion Peak, on the fast approaching road to the Kaofeng Zen Master's stupa, there was an overturned large rock, about twenty or thirty yards wide. The row of icicles hanging upside down from this rock was truly a spectacle of the world.</p>
<p>After resting for a few moments at Lion's Mouth, we looked south from the small window of the thatched hut and finally had confidence in climbing the mountain. Although Lion's Mouth was still halfway up the mountain, and there were still more than ten miles to the summit of West Tianmu, the "World's Wonder" Heavenly Pillar Peak, looking south from Lion's Mouth, we were already floating in the air. Giant rocks, small hills, misty trees, and cloud streams were all under our feet. The Chan Yuan Grand Zen Temple below Cuiwei Rock, Huashi Peak, and Xuri Peak looked like only a few small mountain study rooms in a painting. Unknowingly, we had already placed ourselves in an area thousands of feet high. The camellia flowers were pure and fragrant, the mountain air was frigid, and the mountain monks' conversations were even more secluded and unique. Having arrived at Lion's Mouth, paying respects to Zen Master Kaofeng's tomb, flipping through the records of scenic spots and literary works on the Ancestral Mountain Records of West Tianmu, pointing here and there, comparing and contrasting with the complete map in the records, we were all a little too happy to return. We wanted to learn from the father of Prince Zhaoming, the oldest legend on Tianmu Mountain, and prepare to devote our bodies to the empty gate of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Speaking of Prince Zhaoming, I almost forgot the oldest legend of Tianmu Mountain, and now it is just right to add it here. According to the old records of Lin'an County in the Wanli period, Tianmu Mountain got its name because it was "fifty miles northwest of the county, that is, Floating Jade Mountain. The Great Buddhist Scripture says it is the thirty-fourth cave heaven in the universe, named Taiwei Yuangai Heaven. The Taiping Huanyu Ji says... The water meanders along the mountain, and the huge sources in the east and west resemble two eyes, hence the name Tianmu. Prince Zhaoming of Liang buried his mother, the concubine Ding, and was slandered by the palace eunuch Bao Maozhi. Unable to clear himself, he felt ashamed and did not see the Emperor (Wu). He came to the Eastern Tianmu Mountain in Lin'an for Zen practice, selected the texts of the Han and Six Dynasties, and wrote ten volumes of the Literary Selections. He took the Diamond Sutra and divided it into thirty-two sections. His lifeblood dried up, and both eyes became blind. The Zen Master Zhigong guided him to wash his eyes with the water of a stone pool, and one eye became bright. He washed them again with the water of the Western Tianmu Mountain, and both eyes became bright. Within a few years, the Emperor sent someone to greet him, and the army waited at the foot of Tianmu Mountain, and thus a temple was built as the Shouci Temple."</p>

<p>"Daddy, where's the chocolate?..." The child jumped to her father's side, wanting to reach into the pocket of his coat, and said loudly. "Ah, didn't buy any today, tomorrow then, be good!" The father picked up the little girl, took the older brother's hand, and walked into the study.</p>
<p>The eight-year-old boy patted his pocket again, looking disappointed, and pouted saying...</p>
<p>"It's been three days since you bought any, Daddy always lies to us!"</p>
<p>The five-year-old girl slid down from her father's hand, ran towards the door, and shouted... "Lu Ma, you said Daddy would buy candy when he came back, you lied to me!"</p>
<p>The father, watching the little girl's running and jumping figure, so lively and clever, with her hair flowing, couldn't help but be reminded of his deceased wife. Turning his head again to see the older child playing with two beautiful little leather balls, with a hint of anger on his face, viewed from the side, he truly looked like the deceased wife. For some reason, he felt very uneasy in his heart, as if apologetic and ashamed, and shifted his gaze from the children to look out the window. Although outside the window were newly blossoming peach blossoms and delicate young willows, the view filled with the essence of spring, the shadow of his deceased wife was still clearly before his eyes, as if he saw her smiling, and as if she was frowning, turning into a resentful look. All of this, of course, was deeply etched in his memory. As soon as he thought of her, everything in their ten years of cohabitation would clearly be remembered one by one. Even if there was an occasional unfortunate event during their cohabitation, it had passed by very peacefully. After her death, the memory of his wife was even more a precious thing. But today, thinking of his deceased beloved wife, he felt apologetic in his heart, even towards the children, he almost felt a bit self-reproachful, especially because these past few days, he had even forgotten to buy the things that the children loved to eat.</p>
<p>At this moment, the older child seemed to have forgotten his disappointment just now and walked to his side saying;</p>
<p>"Dad, our school is sending us to Longhua for a trip next Sunday, didn't you say you'd go play with us?" "I'll play with you for two days during spring break, okay?"</p>
<p>"Okay, but don't forget!" The child thought of the candy that hadn't been bought for three days again.</p>
<p>"How could I forget..." He stroked the child's head for a while and said... "A guest is coming in a little while, let's go out together then." He hadn't had a chance to say this to the child, and he had been struggling for a while.</p>
<p>The child jumped up happily. The little girl heard the sound and came in from outside as well, eagerly speaking to her brother, "Dad has a guest coming today, and he's going for a walk with us." She pointed to her father's lap and said... "Daddy, what kind of guest is coming?"</p>
<p>The father hesitated for a moment, "I haven't come here before, that guest will definitely like you, wait for him!" Children are the most impatient, and as soon as they heard their father say this, they waited anxiously for the guest. In a family that has lost its mother, although there are two authentic female servants to take care of things, the children always feel too lonely, so they are especially happy when there is something new. In the end, the father coaxed them to go play with the leather balls in the courtyard, and they left happily.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Financial Hearts Fail to Rally, Standard Gold Firm, then Returns Down; Futures Silver Still Shrinks, Briefly Breaking the 70 Yuan Mark; Silver Agreement Difficult to Effectively Increase by One Yuan <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market anticipated that the price of silver would surely rise overnight, but unexpectedly, the closing price of futures silver fell more than it rose. Disappointed, the price of gold rose again, but because there was a considerable supply taking advantage of the high price, it still fell. With people's hearts not firm, the market situation is difficult to boost. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in Britain and America both fell. The forward silver price at the Gold Exchange rose in the near term and fell in the long term. Exchange rates continued to fall. London raw gold fell two pence. American cotton rose and fell slightly. American wheat shrank by 1.375 points. The raw market opened and immediately jumped to over 70 yuan, but the overnight exchange market was quite strong. To prevent banks from spitting out at high prices, there were also many sellers in the gold market. Speculator Wu also sold, and the situation declined. Later, with August US dollars at 34.9375 yuan, the market stabilized, and it was even lower. After opening, the situation was still stable. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced the rates, with both British and American rates flat. The market situation was mostly in flux. Before long, people's hearts weakened, the swap spread was also low, and sellers in the market were more active, causing a decline. However, the rise and fall were not great, and the trend was mostly in flux. At noon, a report from the Associated Press stated that Peru had not yet approved the London Silver Agreement. Since a silver-producing country had not approved it, there was talk that the Silver Agreement would be difficult to achieve full effect. Guang merchants bought in and rebounded. The fluctuations in the afternoon were extremely narrow. It was rumored that the Central Bank had a tendency to release long positions, falling back to 5.5 yuan. The price of pure gold was 983.5 yuan. The market situation for the first half of the day will be recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 966.3 yuan, up 1.3 yuan from the previous day. Items opened at 6.4 jiao. The exchange market opened with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling 4 pence and 0.0625 for the British pound, and 34.5 yuan for the US dollar. The market was stable during the first session. Mitsui also shorted August US dollars at 9375, but quickly reported difficulty selling. Hengyu, Hengchang, and Yong sold futures, and retreated from 6.8 jiao to 5.2 jiao.

<p>Yesterday, the foreign short-term loan market was slightly weaker than the previous day, measured at 4 points, while the call loan rate remained at 2 points. The situation was similar to the previous day. However, silver and money businesses outside the market were unusually calm about long-term news. All kinds of collateral loans and credit loans were also stagnant and immobile. It can be seen that the business stagnation of the financial world is once again showing itself. According to this long-term period, in previous years, there were 15 and 20 two-month delivery contracts, but the loaning in October of last year was scarce. There was a limited exchange transaction for these two periods. Therefore, there is no news of maturity this time. In the short-term bill market, 4.34 million was transferred in the morning, with new transactions of over 200,000. Over 100,000 was transacted in the afternoon. Over 500,000 was transacted in the small association. Foreign collateral loan transactions took back over 600,000, with new loans made out of over 900,000.

<h3 id="e239">Securities Market: Bull and Bear Stalemate in the Bond Market — Mostly Rises, Few Falls, by Two or Three Jiao — <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange's market showed signs of fluctuations, and the trend did not seem to be a sudden drop. The bull and bear sides, apart from swaps, had a stalemate. Initially, news was dull, and most people thought that the situation in North China would not escalate. Later, because there was a telegram of opposition from the Southwest, although this was commonplace, market prices were slightly affected. The number of transactions was extremely large. Fluctuations temporarily could not last, and the winds of infighting would be in the future. Rumors about 96 arose and died on their own. Now it is rumored that the old 96s that have not been exchanged for new tickets cannot be circulated in the market. The number is very large, and they now request the same treatment as new tickets. If so, the chips in the market will suddenly become crowded, so the selling side is suddenly active. In the morning session, the first board was slightly smaller by one or two jiao, and the second board felt even more chaotic, with both increases and decreases. Among them, only No. 53's need for troop reductions was extremely active, so both boards rose by about one jiao. In the afternoon, the situation was slightly better, and short positions slightly swapped, and market prices were slightly higher by two or three jiao. However, 96 did not improve due to the wild selling of Nos. 4, 46, and 75. There were many transactions, and No. 75 was newly sold, while Nos. 5, etc., were very strong in eating up. Closing was possible, and after the news that the market price had the potential to continue to rise after it was rumored that there was an opposition telegram in the southwest, this was slightly frustrated, and the trend was vague, and there was high and low reciprocation, about one jiao or so. In the end, the market prices were also high and low, mostly rises, few falls, by two or three jiao only. The total number of transactions was about 15 million yuan. The results of their high and low rises and falls are listed on the left.</p>

<p>According to the New York agent of Xinxinfeng Foreign Company's Wall Street Journal market report, Chicago grains turned up at the end of yesterday, stock market pressure also dissipated, and market prices rebounded. Sentiment in the Chicago grain market was excited, reaching its peak. Longs rushed to get out, like a raging wave. By the close, outside buyers came back in, and the market turned upward. According to the opinion of grain traders, grain prices have fallen by more than 10 jiao in recent days. Although 47 million bushels of May futures have not yet been settled, a technical rebound will soon occur. The quarterly report of American Telephone and Telegraph was quite good, so prices tended to rise, and each stock followed suit. Small exchanges and bonds were slightly higher, mixed. Also, according to this bank's New York agent's report, the "securities" market was quite good and was not affected by the weakness of the grain exchange. "Wheat" longs continued to sell off, and it seemed to be ending. The northwest production area was still dry, and if prices continued to fall, it would be appropriate to buy. Corn was even better. "Cotton" was thrown out by peers in the morning and was easily absorbed, showing that the technical position was strong, and the market was firm. However, the outcome of the legislative issues was still difficult to predict, so the future was still chaotic. According to reports, the Senate, for the welfare of the public, hopes that the government will purchase one million bales of cotton. The "Rubber" market was firm, and peers were buying in quickly for consumption. Before a solution to limit production is reached, there will generally be no major fluctuations. "Sugar" futures were calm, waiting for the outcome of the sugar case. Cash made good progress, and if there is good development, market prices will not be difficult to move upwards. "Silver" New York prices were lower than London prices, and speculators bought in the New York market. The selling of silver limit price brokers was absorbed. There were 940,000 shares traded throughout the day. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market remains sluggish. Due to the lack of effective measures for the April marked yarn, it is reported that some 1,000 to 2,000 bales of old inventory are unable to be transferred to the May term, thus the price decline has not been curbed. However, the forward market sentiment is stable, though many scattered short sellers maintain a policy of selling on rallies, so market pressure remains high. According to the latest news, the exchange meeting is increasing special guarantees for new marked yarn to suppress selling and maintain market prices.</p>
<p>(Marked Yarn Stagnant) The marked yarn market opened higher due to profit-takers covering cotton after the sharp decline, with prices rising by five, six, and seven jiao across the months. However, selling pressure in the current month resurfaced in the afternoon, causing a decline of 1.1 yuan for the current month alone, and declines of 1.256 yuan for the forward months. The total daily transaction volume was 40,900 bales. Sales included Taichang 1,300 bales, Dachangcheng 800 bales, Changji 500 bales, Xincheng 450 bales, Shunda 900 bales, Hengde 600 bales, Gengfeng 1,050 bales, Yuanda 900 bales, Xinchang 550 bales, and Tongji 450 bales. Purchases included Yuande 1,800 bales, Mingde 2,750 bales, Chunji 1,550 bales, Changyu 1,550 bales, Changfeng 2,050 bales, and Xiesheng 450 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>April | 161.4 | 160.3 | 160.3 | Down 0.6 | 25,050</p>

<p>Total |  |  |  |  | 209,300</p>
<p>(800 Bales Sold Spot) Spot yarn sales are still good. Total purchases by all gangs for the day are estimated at 802 bales. Prices are similar to the previous day. Purchase amounts by each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 640, Fujian-Guangdong 25, Yunnan 90</p>
<p>Jiangxi 10, Ningbo 17, Shantou 15</p>

<p>The cotton market tends to be flat due to the failure to deliver sufficient chips for the current month, and because U.S. cotton has not continued to fall. Thus, selling pressure has subsided somewhat. Although actual cotton consumption has not developed significantly, sporadic transactions continue, so the cotton market is struggling.</p>
<p>(Marked Cotton Rebound for Two Months) The marked cotton market opened higher due to mixed movements in U.S. cotton and a 4-rupee decline in Indian cotton. However, local sellers were not enthusiastic, and prices rose by one or two jiao across the months, then rose another five fen in the afternoon. The total daily transaction volume was 64,200 dan. Sales included Yuanda 4,500 dan, Suilong 1,700 dan, Gengfeng 4,600 dan, Renfeng 2,800 dan, Xincheng 1,000 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,900 dan, Tongfu 1,000 dan, Yicheng 1,600 dan, and Dachang 1,000 dan. Purchases included Mingde 4,900 dan, Yukang 3,100 dan, Jifeng 1,900 dan, Chunji 1,600 dan, Shenji 1,500 dan, Changfeng 1,800 dan, Shenchang 1,800 dan, and Changhe 1,100 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Cotton | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest</p>

<p>Total |  |  |  |  | 641,900</p>
<p>(Factory Demand Further Declines) Actual cotton demand is weak. Factory purchases are less frequent. Sources include 550 bales of Tonghua cotton. Current cotton prices are as follows: Lingbao cotton 49.25; Gongda factory purchased 250 pieces for delivery to the factory; Huoji cotton 37.75; domestic and foreign factories purchased 800 bales for delivery to the factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday's U.S. cotton market initially fell due to seller pressure, then rose due to Japanese buying and reactionary buying. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices rose and fell by one or two points. Liverpool spot cotton fell 13 points, and futures fell 11 or 12 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to selling by Japanese traders and brokers. As a result, Pingar fell 2.5 rupees, Omra fell 4.5 rupees, and Balo Creek fell 4.75 rupees. (Telegraph from the 17th)</p>

<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, prices for all months showed signs of weakening. As quotations for foreign wheat fell by about four jiao in Chicago and about two jiao in Canada, market sentiment turned apprehensive after the opening, losing its previous composure. As the issue of silver prices abroad is unresolved, commodity prices may possibly return to a dire situation. Domestic consumption remains sluggish as before, causing the position of the bulls to suddenly turn unfavorable. Prices opened weakly, and at the afternoon opening, both near-term and forward-month bulls continued to exit. Although factories largely avoided price-cutting, it was rumored that some secretly offered discounts, further undermining confidence. If actual sales do not pick up, unpredictable changes may occur in the future. As a result, the current month fell by 1.25 fen, May fell by 1.75 fen, June fell by 1.5 fen, July fell by 1.25 fen, and August and September fell by 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Extreme Selling of Forward Wheat <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the forward wheat market yesterday, prices for all months showed signs of stability in the near term but declines in the far term. As quotations for foreign wheat continued to fall, with Chicago down slightly by four jiao and Canada down slightly by two jiao, the forward situation shifted as the weather became more favorable, causing most people to change their outlooks. Furthermore, the decline in various commodity prices suggests that the market value of new goods will continue to weaken. Consequently, selling pressure increased sharply, and prices gradually declined. Looking ahead, there is still potential for continued small declines. As a result, June fell by four fen, July fell by five fen, and August fell by four fen. The current wheat market is characterized by factory stoppages and unopened offers.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Late Rice Arrivals Scarce, Prices Rise by Five Fen <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Sources from various gangs are similar to before, with arrivals expected around the 30th (over 5,000 people). Apart from some small-scale sales in the late rice market, customer gangs continue to operate smoothly. The only difference is that the Nanyang gang is completely on the sidelines, while only the Tianjin Weihaiwei and other customer gangs from the northern gang have started to participate due to the stable situation. However, the Nanyang gang has not taken any action. Goods from Gao City and other places have been able to be sold off, while those from Zhongguan are sidelined. As sellers feel that arrivals are not abundant, they will inevitably raise prices, but it is difficult for the overall trend to improve significantly. Customers still have no interest in special goods. Although there are 2,400 to 2,500 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and other goods, they are mostly large-market and ordinary goods, and prices have only risen slightly by four or five fen. The Chang gang's thick japonica rice from Sudong and Nangang is still only being purchased by shops, and demand remains normal, so the overall trend remains similar, and market prices have not changed. Although the decline in Du Yangjian is small, arrivals have not increased, so the market remains stable, and negative changes have not affected its reputation.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 26 to 27 boats arrived from various gangs in Hexia. Sales of various colors of rice are brisk in the market. Bai Jing Bian Yin Yuan and Yang Jian are quite popular. Du Jian, Bu Jian, Bo Dao Ke Jian are still active. High-quality Bai Jing is scarce and stands firm. Medium-quality rice is tight by three to five fen. Bian Yin Yuan is scarce and expensive, approaching a corner. Yang Jian, Du Jian, Bu Jian, Ke Jian, early rice, and Bo Dao prices are firm.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Min-Shan Gangs Continue to Actively Trade Customer Xian Rice <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer Xian rice market saw active arrivals and sales. Customer gangs were very enthusiastic, especially those from Fuzhou in Fujian Province. Quanzhou gangs were also very active, and Shantou gangs suddenly emerged with strong trading. A total of 5,130 bags of various types of rice were sold throughout the city. More than 1,000 bags went to Shantou, 300 bags to Wenzhou, and 500 bags to local merchants. The rest were purchased by Fuzhou and Quanzhou gangs. Local merchants also purchased 300 bags of small rice. Prices remained stable except for brown rice, which fell by four or five fen. This was because arrivals and stocks of brown rice had been sufficient for several days. Yesterday, more brown rice arrived from Shashi and Hunan, and sellers were eager to sell early. As traders from Shanxi and Tianjin were willing to lower prices, they were able to sell. As arrivals of Ji Yuan rice in Hexia have been weak recently, and orders are few, Xi Yuan rice has attracted attention from various gangs in the north and south. Yesterday, prices continued to rise by five fen, and the outlook for the future remains optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Soybean Market in a Holding Pattern <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market sentiment remained stable, and sales were clear. As merchants were concerned about recovering their capital, transportation volumes were reduced, and the market is temporarily in a holding pattern. Factory transactions yesterday included two cars of Bangbu soybeans at a price of 2.5 yuan, and 500 bags of Dangshan soybeans, also at a price of 2.5 yuan. Local merchants purchased two cars of Feihe soybeans at a price of 2.67 to 2.6 yuan, and 200 bags of Yude soybeans at a price of 2.67 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Sugar Market: Hu Qing Sugar Prices Stabilize <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>There was little progress in the sugar market yesterday. The association's listed price for 24-grain granulated white sugar was 19.8 yuan, but there were no transactions. A few dozen bags of goods from this store were sold at a price of 19.9 yuan. Prices for 89# He Chi were similar to the previous day, with little change. Taikoo B Mark was 20.01 yuan, CW Mark was 19.85 yuan, DY was 19.6 yuan, and HX was 19.2 yuan, down one or two jiao from before. No. 1 white sugar from this factory was 18.3 yuan, also down a jiao or so. More than 60 bags of domestically produced Zhiyang were opened at a price of 15.3 yuan. More than 40 bags of Gao Ti Qing were opened at a price of 11.88 yuan. Over a hundred bags of Longjiang Qing were opened at a price of 10.04 yuan to 10.03 yuan. Market sentiment is stabilizing.</p>

<p>With weak sales, black melon seed prices have trended downward. There have been sporadic transactions by various gangs recently, so offers for several hundred bags have been made, with prices ranging from 10.06 yuan to 9.2 yuan. Seeds from Xuzhou are the weakest, while seeds from Dangshan are more sought after due to their black color and scarcity. Sales offers are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mingguang Seeds 9.00; Jikui Seeds 15.00; Dangshan Seeds 11.50 to 8.50; Jizhong Seeds 13.00; Tizhuang Seeds 12.00; Zhongmou Seeds 8.20; Xukui Seeds 9.30; Liuhe Seeds 11.50; Bozhou Seeds 9.50; Xukui Seeds 10.60; Tushan Seeds 10.00; Hu Seeds 8.50; Xuzhong Seeds 9.00</p>

<p>"Xiushui Wuning Black Tea" has suffered a major setback in business over the past decade due to the weakness of Russian sales. It has declined even more in recent years. Although the authorities have been planning to revive it from time to time, there have been few practical remedies, resulting in very little success. Last year, due to the global economic panic, various foreign firms changed their sales focus. They all reduced purchases of Qixiu tea, which was expensive.

<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Recently, Zheng Xiaoxu and Xi Qia, important figures in the puppet organization in the Northeast, went to Japan. In Tokyo, they discussed the economic issues of the puppet organization with Japanese Prime Minister Saito and Colonization Minister Nagai. As a result, they concluded a heartbreaking contract on economic relations in the four eastern provinces. This is another good opportunity for Japan to develop on our country's territory! Not only should our Chinese authorities not ignore this incident, but all countries that have economic relations with the puppet state should also pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>Originally, since the establishment of the puppet state in our Northeast, all powers have long been in the hands of the Japanese. They are free to act, and control and regulate as they please. Who dares to interfere? The economic chain is self-evident. Because this fact was realized long before Zheng and Xi went to Japan, Japan's various plunder in the Northeast economy is now more clearly exposed, and they are still not satisfied and want to further manipulate it.</p>
<p>The four eastern provinces have now become an economic colony for Japanese production. This is an undeniable fact. Their farcical performance is nothing more than deceiving outsiders. However, no matter how farcical the farce is, it ultimately cannot escape the scope of deception. Therefore, contradictory behaviors emerge endlessly. We feel a little embarrassed when we see this ugliness, but they still reveal the original form nakedly.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, as a result of the trip of Zheng and Xi to Tokyo, a "Japan-Manchuria Economic Cooperation Method" was agreed upon, and a contract of servitude was also signed: "Manchuria opens its doors to welcome investment from all countries" and "The powers must recognize Japan's special economic position in Manchuria." The main points of its content are: "To develop industry, Manchuria is naturally a raw material country, but in order to prepare for future development as an industrial country, it will encourage financial and technical assistance from Japan and cooperation between Japanese and Manchurian economic groups..." "And welcome the fair investment of capitalists from the powers, but must not conflict with the specificity of the Japan-Manchuria economy and Japan's special interests..." This is the so-called principle of the "open door" in Manchuria. In fact, Japan has long recognized that the four eastern provinces are its supply base for industrial raw materials. Therefore, there is no doubt that the current non-construction of industry in Manchuria is a confirmed step. Even if Manchuria has the opportunity to build an industrial country in certain circumstances in the future, it must be promoted by Japanese capital and technology. Therefore, the statement "open door, welcome investment from all countries" is nothing more than a gimmick played by the Japanese to create a deceptive guise. In fact, they are very clearly telling you - reject all countries' investment in Manchuria. Isn't that so? That is: "But must not conflict with the specificity of the Japan-Manchuria economy and Japan's special interests..." Their meaning is completely encompassed in the above statement. The intention is here, no more need to be said.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Is This Called Making a Fuss? <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>It is very embarrassing and heartbreaking to say, but we Chinese people don't know much about the affairs of our own country, either because they are too complicated and broad, or because we think they are insignificant. We seem to be unwilling to understand them; on the contrary, foreigners understand them more thoroughly and clearly than we do. It goes without saying that political and economic situations are very closely related to various countries, and they naturally have to pay attention to them; even other trivial matters, they are unwilling to ignore. The reason why they are so concerned about the national conditions of our country is not that foreigners like to meddle in other people's business, but that they have ulterior motives. To cite a practical example, like Japan's attitude toward our country, they pay close attention to and study everything. They investigate in detail which mountain in our country has gold mines, which sea has delicious seafood, which place produces the most rice, and which place produces a lot of silk. As for the political situation, social conditions, customs, habits, etc. in various places, they are also not unfamiliar. In short, they can be said to know everything about the national conditions of our country. Especially regarding the situation in the Northeast, they are even more aware of everything. Their plot to conquer the Northeast is not a matter of one day or one night; they have been planning it for a very long time. Military strategists say: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." The great powers' attempts to invade our country are probably based on this strategy. Therefore, they are all committed to studying our country's national conditions. This is a terrible tactic!</p>
<p>Indeed, perhaps they have received a good lesson from others, and Chinese people have recently become quite concerned about Japan's national conditions. After September 18th, our country suffered a major blow from this, and we have always been wary of Japan. To this day, although Chinese people share the determination to recover lost territory and avenge humiliation, after all, our strength is insufficient, and it is not easy to achieve this goal. However, Chinese people already know that if we want to recover lost territory and avenge our shame, on the one hand, we must endure hardship and humiliation; on the other hand, we must also pay full attention to Japan's national conditions. Therefore, a group of enlightened people have joined forces to work on this. Several research groups on Japan's national conditions have been established one after another in various parts of our country, and publications discussing various phenomena of Japanese politics, society, and economy have been found on the market. Many celebrities and scholars also frequently lecture on Japanese issues. Although we dare not say what effect such efforts will have, it can at least serve as a preparation for dealing with Japan in the future. This is not necessarily a happy fact. However, if the patriotic enthusiasm of Chinese people does not exceed five minutes, then research on Japanese issues is probably just a temporary excitement and will not last long. We are holding infinite doubts about this; who knows, the sensitive Japanese have already been making a fuss and getting anxious there. Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily published such a piece of news: "In this era of declining industries, operators of magazines are also suffering a major blow due to exchange rate relations. Not only are housewives and professional women saving money, but companies and stores are also sharply reducing their purchasing power of mass magazines due to downsizing and reorganization. On the one hand, the Chinese intellectual class has recently been studying Japan enthusiastically, and the sales of economic magazines and other specialized scientific magazines published in Japan have been increasing. Can such a frightening Chinese fever for studying Japan be regarded as a superficial phenomenon?"</p>
<p>"A guilty conscience is easily frightened." Japan is making a big fuss about the fact that Chinese people have recently been trading a few more magazines in their bookstores, saying that it is a Chinese fever for studying Japan. They are panic-stricken and think that it is not a superficial phenomenon. This is really a bit neurotic, like the man of Qi worrying about the sky falling, pitiful and ridiculous. But this alone is enough to show their deep concern and consideration for everything. In contrast, in our country, don't say that we don't care about things like foreigners studying Chinese fever; even if there are enemies who want to measure our fortresses and spy on our artillery positions, I am afraid that we will also turn a blind eye! They, Japan, have been studying our country for a long time, and their achievements are solid. There are more than a thousand kinds of books and magazines published in their country that describe the situation in China and discuss Chinese issues. How often have we paid attention to them? They have established various research associations to conduct detailed reviews of everything in our country. They also often organize various investigation groups to go to various places in our country for field observation and investigation. We have never felt that these actions with an aggressive intention are anything to be afraid of. In view of this, the loss of the land of the four northeastern provinces of our country is not without reason.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it is an overestimation for Japan to make a fuss about the fact that Chinese people read a few more Japanese magazines. Even if some people are now enthusiastic about studying Japan, studying is just studying; we will never have the ambition of their study of our country, which is to prepare for future aggression against Sakhalin or Kyushu. The result of our research may be to learn a little more about Japan's true face and ambition. At most, it will only put a layer of resistance on Japan's conspiracy to annex our country in the future. You can rest assured!</p>

<p>Although the paths taken in life are different, the final destination is the same.</p>
<p>Love is not necessarily great, and hate is not necessarily fierce. People mostly love what they love and hate what they hate; I have never heard of anyone who loves what they hate or hates what they love. The existence of exploiters is because the exploited dare not resist.</p>

<h3 id="e258">The New Birth of Women <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Chen</p>
<p>When the raging tide of revolution shattered the shackles of feudalism, and everything plunged into a stormy sea, our women also struggled desperately to break free from their fetters; undeniably, this was a beautiful dawn on the horizon for the women's world.</p>
<p>In this era of transition from bound feet to unbound feet, we have witnessed many great miracles; at the same time, petty thieves and scoundrels have also seized the opportunity to become active. When the slogan of "women's liberation" shocked people's consciousness, society was clearly gripped by a mood of unease!</p>
<p>This is an obvious fact: for thousands of years, the bonds of traditional ethics have tightly bound the bodies and minds of every woman in China, and every woman has lived in an environment of deep water and scorching fire, with her heart already filled with the sorrow of a world destroyed and a life extinguished; but the feminine maxim of "three obediences and four virtues" is like a loud bronze bell in an ancient temple, its terrifying sound deeply embedded in people's hearts. This magic, unbelievably, subdues intense flames and restrains surging emotions. Although, in such a fiery environment, we have also seen Zhuo Wenjun's bold elopement, still told as a beautiful tale of running a wine shop; and Hua Mulan's heroic enlistment in the army, earning the admiration of thousands; but the former is ultimately "not embraced by gentlemen," and the latter is ridiculed as a "female tiger." Truly, let alone the modest daughters of humble families, even the noble young ladies of wealthy households merely spend their youth secretly in the position of cattle, horses, and slaves, until their skin wrinkles and their hair turns white, thus ending their entire lives!</p>
<p>Following women's liberation, the masses were stirred by "free love." In any case, this is the result of women's courageous struggle; they have broken the inhumane "foot bindings" from a ghostly hell, torn apart the tight "corsets," broken through the barriers of traditional ethics, and slowly run along the fragrant path of roses, expressing the gentle emotions unique to women in the midst of blossoming flowers and shaded willows—a maiden, a maiden of springtime, when she feels inner loss or vital stagnation, can freely radiate her sharp and clear gaze to seek comfort, to pursue the honey-sweet nectar!</p>
<p>However, bodies and minds accustomed to restraint, suddenly released, are like wild horses freed from their tethers, and the entire population is once again swept into the sea of desire, leading society into a deformed state!</p>
<p>This is undeniable: modern love has become a gilded idol; corpulent people can embrace left and right, keeping beauties in golden houses; young masters can play with women at their will, and women also shift their gaze with gold, taking gold as the standard of love. Therefore, women, having just reached the end of the thorny path, have once again fallen into a smog-filled fog—when women have seized their own souls, they are once again hung on hooks by butchers, ready to be sold for a good price. People say, "Women are like mutton and dog meat, as long as there is a sufficient price, one can possess their entire body and entire soul." Although this is an extreme argument from misogynists, the path of Chinese women has ultimately formed a triangular pattern—from being lifeless and dull, to being energetic and vigorous, and now reversing, becoming extravagant, luxurious, and licentious!</p>
<p>I ask, how many young men and women can rely on pure love without being lured by profit?</p>
<p>Is this the result of women's liberation? No chastity, no purity! The so-called modern women only liberate their three-inch golden lotuses into six-inch round feet; they regard the inherent virtues of women as worthless, and liberate themselves into licentiousness and romance! But what about their souls? They have been swallowed by gold! Wearing laurel wreaths, standing in the clouds of cigar smoke and champagne, they extend their white thighs, protrude their breasts, and reveal arrogant smiles to the people! "In this national goods year of women raising their eyebrows and exhaling, women should get rid of all old dross and vigorously carry out their own rebirth!" people say.</p>
<p>Yes, playing decadent music on a volcano and dancing the foxtrot, thus burying promising youth, when the earth explodes, won't there only be some wretched, pitiful skulls left!</p>

<p>— Letian</p>
<p>After spending two days in Hangzhou, I suffered a bellyful of idleness. Such a fine Xizi (West Lake), was completely ravaged by that inhumane cement. Leifeng Pagoda collapsed, and its collapse was a swift one. As long as the pagoda base exists for one day, it is still worth the suspension of later generations for one day. Only the Baoshu Pagoda, which is known for its beauty, and the Xia Qing Tomb, were unfortunately surrounded and imprisoned by cement. Alas! To repair ancient relics in order to preserve them, yet the fine ancient relics lost their original color due to the repairs. How lamentable!</p>
<p>The Su and Bai Causeways have been widened, and cars come and go like shuttles, the sound of horns breaking the tranquility of the lake and mountains. It doesn't seem as flavorful as the sound of a small donkey's hooves! In order to facilitate traffic, one has to put up with their idleness.</p>
<p>Visiting West Lake once or twice is nothing rare, but there are always some bored "literate people" who want to write graffiti. When they write, they can't escape "XXX was here." So I say that the West Lake has more of these literate people who "were here." Not only will the walls never be clean, but these literate people are guaranteed to stink for ten thousand years!</p>
<h3 id="e260">A Record of Quitting Smoking <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>I know that my only weakness in life is "procrastination." Except for things that I find most enjoyable, which I do with great enthusiasm, I always delay everything else. Whether it's doing work or dealing with some bad habits in life. Take smoking, for example. I know it's harmful and useless, and in my heart, I clearly don't want to smoke it; but once I've started, I clearly want to find a way to quit. However, my relationship with cigarettes has a history of eight years.</p>
<p>It was probably in the autumn of my fifteenth year when I was studying at a middle school in City C. Although I was still in a class one year higher, I still felt that the class level was too shallow, and I didn't pay much attention to my studies, yet I was still better than most. But I was very "procrastinating" and didn't know how to use my precious time for other self-study activities. All day long, I just shouted "bored" in my room. A classmate, Mr. C, who was sitting opposite me, was also feeling bored. So the two of us chatted non-stop every day, and when chatting wasn't enough, we continued with smoking and drinking tea. Thus, the poisonous thing called cigarettes officially became associated with me.</p>
<p>Once I became addicted, I won't lie, I was constantly regretting it in my heart. Because of regret, I often resolved to quit smoking, but the result was always that I couldn't quit. Now, in these eight years, I have quit smoking in a grand manner more than five times. The longest I quit was for more than a month, and the rest mostly lasted for three to five days before I relaxed again. In this process... at first, it seemed like I had determination, but when the craving came, this determination disappeared like wisps of cloud. So I had two Ah Q-style mental comforts. The first was... in my life, I have no other bad habits—I don't gamble, I don't drink, and I don't prostitute myself, just this one smoking habit. Why bother trying so hard to quit? Compared to most people, aren't I much more well-behaved? So my desire to quit smoking suddenly cooled down by half. The second was... the so-called human society, the civilized world, is originally supported by some tricks. If there were no people smoking cigarettes, what kind of world would it be? Moreover, a person's life is only a few decades long. If you only walk on the good path, that's simply being an idiot, asking for trouble. So my desire to quit smoking suddenly cooled down completely.</p>
<p>Once my desire to quit cooled down, my desire to smoke heated up. I would reach into my pocket and if I had spare change, I would immediately go to buy cigarettes, even if it was a torn bill. Here, there is a kind of intense contradiction: once the cigarettes are bought, should I smoke them or not? The result is always that smoking wins over not smoking.</p>
<p>Here, I have an unspeakable shame! I remember three years ago when I lived in Jiangwan, I had several close friends who, in order to persuade me to quit smoking, treated me to a rich meal. The result was that I still couldn't quit. Now when we meet, I still have a cigarette in my mouth like a god, and my heart is indeed thirteen parts ashamed.</p>
<p>This matter is indeed somewhat mysterious. Why can't I quit? I know it's harmful, and I know I want to quit, but I still can't quit no matter what. After eight years, I finally understand today, "It's because I don't have genuine determination!" That's why I can't quit. Now I am determined to quit, and the reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Smoking is really too uneconomical now. A pack of Golden Mouse brand cigarettes, which used to cost ten cents, has soared to fifteen cents, and a pack of Big Fairy, which used to cost eight cents, has also risen to eleven cents. Before, it was still okay, if I couldn't afford Golden Mouse, I would downgrade to Big Fairy, and then downgrade again to Little Fairy. But now, because of the environment, I feel that it's too inappropriate not to smoke Beautiful brand, but this expense is really not small. Two packs a day cost "two yuan and eight jiao," which is really too uneconomical.</p>
<p>(2) I have some tendency to be degenerate. Procrastination, complacency, lack of effort, and lack of progress are all terrible things. There is absolutely no room for me to comfort myself. I should cheer up and continue the struggle of the past few years, to fight the harsh environment, and the most important thing is to start by quitting smoking.</p>
<p>(3) Recently, there is the so-called New Life Movement. After carefully reviewing their draft, I feel that it is a way for the Chinese people to save themselves, and quitting smoking is one of the items. The value of this movement lies in the fact that we ordinary people ourselves should implement it. Relying solely on adults and teachers shouting slogans will not have any good results. In order to be a healthy Chinese citizen, I am also determined to quit smoking.</p>
<p>(4) The harm of cigarettes is really too great. For eight years, it has made my brain too unclear, dizzy and muddled. If I don't quit, it will be even worse in the future.</p>
<p>(5) To accept the advice of some friends and wash away the shame that has accumulated in my heart, I must quit smoking.</p>
<p>I have quit smoking, I am determined to quit smoking.</p>

<h3 id="e261">Thinking Left and Right, Difficult <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am twenty years old now. When I was sixteen, I was introduced by a friend of my father to learn a trade in an old-fashioned shop in the evil Shanghai, which can be said to be a three-year fixed-term imprisonment. Unfortunately, my parents passed away together the year before last, leaving behind two elder brothers. Recently, due to poor business, the family is truly in a state of bare walls; I, fortunately, last winter, completed my three-year fixed-term imprisonment and was kindly granted a monthly salary of two silver dollars by the boss. Now, the family often writes to me, asking me to send money to repay debts. I only receive a meager salary each month, and I can't even take care of myself. How can I have money to repay debts? I now want to change careers, but as a small clerk with shallow knowledge and little learning, there is no place for me to stand in society; if I don't change careers, I will continue to suffer from economic pressure. I think left and right, it is difficult.</p>
<p>Sir, you are the compass for youth. I am in a dark maze, begging.</p>
<p>Sir, please give me a bright path. I believe that you will not disappoint me. It would be best if you could give me a reply in your newspaper in the shortest possible time. With utmost respect, I wish you</p>
<p>Literary Peace. Lu Jiarong</p>
<p>Answer: Mr. Lu's letter is indeed a difficult problem. Besides thinking left and right with you, the editor really cannot find a way for you to get rich immediately. You want to change careers, to find a better-paying job, which is a solution, but you also feel a lack of work skills. However, in the editor's opinion, even if you have the ability, whether you will find a good job is still a question. We often hear about "oversupply of labor" and "sharp increase in unemployment." Among the unemployed, there are also many people with work skills who, due to hunger and cold, are willing to sell their labor cheaply. Even so, many people still cannot find work. So I dare not advise you to change careers, because I don't know whether you can change careers, and even if you can, it may not solve your financial difficulties. Aren't the salaries of current shop assistants and apprentices about the same? As for learning work skills, although I strongly agree, I cannot guarantee that you will be able to obtain a good job as a result. Therefore, if you want to solve your livelihood with personal effort under the current situation, there is no full guarantee.</p>
<p>However, solving financial difficulties is not without a solution, but if you think that this can only be solved by personal effort, it may be a bit difficult to think left and right. Because now, in general, people who rely on labor for a living feel poor in this society. Your situation is not unique to you; it is probably the common sorrow of most shop assistants and apprentices. Therefore, this problem is not just your personal problem, but a whole social problem; so the solution to your personal problem is also the solution to the social problem. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of poverty, we should not focus on finding a good job, but should, under the banner of everyone seeking economic liberation, use our collective strength to seek a thorough solution.</p>
<p>This should be our goal of effort, but how should we do it? The editor believes that our efforts should be, on the one hand, to enrich our knowledge and recognize the sources of disease in the current complex society, and at the same time to promote the struggle to reform these sources of disease. This is essential for thorough economic liberation. But we cannot completely abandon the efforts to improve the economy under the current situation, and we should also try our best to struggle in the difficult and arduous life. Therefore, within the possible range, we need to learn some work skills to make our jobs secure and make it easier to find a job; moreover, work skills are also very necessary in the construction phase after the reform of the social system. But the economic liberation we strive for is not to covet material enjoyment. So I hope that you will not "be content with your current situation and find joy in it," but you should not be too bothered by this problem, thinking every day about using various methods to increase your income. As for the debts you owe, when you are in this state of "not being able to take care of yourself," you can just keep them unpaid. In fact, you want to repay them, but you have no ability to repay them, so you don't have to sell your unnecessary brainpower for this problem. The editor</p>

<p>— Man Zhi</p>
<p>When the wife heard this last sentence, she was a little scared in her heart. Her eyes widened as she stared at Sixth Master and said, "Isn't it good to send him to the authorities?"</p>
<p>"It will cost money! And it won't be able to quench the hatred in my heart!"</p>
<p>The wife was a famous lady of "three obediences and four virtues," and she absolutely obeyed Sixth Master. She did not dare to say much, let alone argue. Sixth Master said again in a commanding tone,</p>
<p>"Kill him tomorrow night. Strangle him alive. You have to lend me a hand. Don't make a sound. Parents killing their son is not a crime, especially this kind of son who harms his parents!"</p>
<p>The wife's body was trembling, her teeth were chattering, and she stared at Sixth Master with mad eyes and said, "I, I, can't!"</p>
<p>"Don't say anything more! If the parents don't do it themselves, who else will? I've already made up my mind, and it can't be changed!" As he spoke, he left the room and went to the study.</p>
<p>The wife felt her head spinning, the things in the room were turning, and the ground was also spinning. The wife fainted on the bed. The maid saw that the master had gone to the study and peered at the doorway. The wife had fallen on the bed and was not like her usual self, so she hurried forward to push her awake and gently called out. The wife woke up, sat up, saw that it was the maid, and asked for tea. The maid took the teapot from the table and went to the kitchen to brew hot water, thinking in her heart that the wife had been angered by Sixth Master, so she walked faster. The maid poured the tea, and the wife asked,</p>
<p>"Has the eldest young master eaten?"</p>
<p>The maid replied, "The young mistress sent it over. The young mistress bought wine for the eldest young master to drink!"</p>
<p>"Hmm!" The wife nodded and reached for the teacup, but she didn't drink the tea immediately, she just sat there blankly. The maid didn't dare to make a sound and stood beside her.</p>
<p>"What time is it now?"</p>
<p>"It's eight o'clock."</p>
<p>The wife was still blank. The maid softly said, "Madam, drink your tea, it's getting cold!"</p>
<p>"Hmm!" The wife said and then drank the tea in her hand.</p>
<p>"I have a bad headache and need to sleep. Close the door after I fall asleep. Tell Chen's wife and the others to go to bed early. Put out the lights."</p>
<p>For every sentence the wife said, the maid responded with a yes. After the maid served the wife to bed, she blew out the lights and closed the door, then went out.</p>
