<p>時評</p>
<h3>論今日的塘沽恊定廷</h3>
<p>因九一八事變而起的中日懸案。在塘沽恊定未訂結前。是個極嚴重的國際問題。塘沽恊定旣訂結後。大體上已一變而爲關涉中日兩國的單純問題了。其如此。所以日本對於該項恊定一同看做「奇貨可居。」不肯輕易放棄。不過在此一年有餘的過程中。日人重視恊定的心理。則已有變遷。當恊定簽訂的當兒。日人覺得藉此一紙文書。可以杜絶中國恢復關外失地的軍事行動。所以恊定對他們是有用的。但在中國履行了義務以後。便須連帶將日軍撤回至長城之綫。於是恊定本身對於他們。不但無用。抑且礙。我們且虚心靜氣的觀察内外形勢。然後自問一下。現在就把塘沽恊定爽快的廢了。能否將九一八以後的中日懸案重新恢復初起時的國際嚴重性。或鼓勵我們率兵出關呢。其間的答語無疑是否定的。可見恊定廢除了。不足以增加日人的困難。難不廢。反足使中國抗議其在華北的行動自由。那末。現在希望撤廢恊定的。應該是日本。而中國尙在其次。日本看透了這一點。故意違背恊定的撤兵條件。故意縱容浪人漢奸在戰區中爲非作惡。無非要我們感覺難堪。逼着我們去提出關於戰區恊定的交涉。然後才得乘機作進一步的利用。塘沽恊定的利害。國人早有定評。我們固然希望趕快把恊定廢了。但其時期必須在日人履行恊定義務之後。否則在今日現實的環境下。高談廢止恊定。恰好爲日人利用。而得不了一點好處。</p>
<p>中日兩國對於塘沽恊定。實在都覺得討厭。但其動機。則絶不相同。中國以消滅恊定爲目的。而日本則以之爲手段。中國希望實行恊定以表示誠意。然後才談撤廢。而日本則要用不履行義務爲手段。强迫接談改訂。似此南轅北轍。本來無從有轉圜的餘地。不過雙方討厭恊定的心理。還算一致。在矛盾中有這樣的雷同。所以依然有談判的事實。</p>
<p>大家知道盤根錯節的華北問題。癥結在於塘沽恊定的存廢。此點有一辦法。其餘的都可迎刃而解。但在日人立塲没有改變以前。談何容易。卽如我們把華北問題看做全國問題。而日方却看做地方問題。我們要想根據恊定把戰區的懸案談判。由中央政府辦理。而日方却堅持由關東軍出面。最近的中日交涉。由北寗路局長殷同。與氣燄萬丈的關東軍代表相折衝。而不由中央人員作對手方。一般人就猜想不至有十分圓滿的結果。假若有相當結果的話。亦决計不是無條件的。旣有條件。恐怕不會對於我們有利。我們要認定。對於以塘沽恊定爲中心的戰區懸案。於其作有苛刻條件的談判。毋寗不談判爲妙。要是恐懼不談判時。日人恃强蠻幹。那末。我們便得講究實力的抵抗。在抵抗能力尙未充分培養以前。只有抱定宗旨説。「你要强佔。由你自便。要我承認。萬萬不能。」這是九一八後我們對於東北件的立塲。現在對於華北問題。亦再不可退讓一步。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭的風雲。已逐漸濃厚了。但日本在没有控制中國的充分把握以前。必不會貿然動手。日本用以控制中國的武器。雖不止一端。而塘沽恊定顯然是最凑手的。他們現在正想以不正當的手段。利用恊定。壓迫中國。要把暫時的。局部的軍事恊定。擴充爲永久的。關係全國的政治經濟恊定。以爲其對俄作戰的便利。日俄戰爭一發生。中國必不免於重大的犧牲。所以我們須擺脱日人的控制。以延緩日俄戰禍的襲來。如果説。日俄開戰後。我們也許有恢復東北失地的可能。那末。更不可在目下受日人的威脅。把塘沽恊定擴大或延長了。本來在日人的對華政策没有根本改革以前。就把塘沽恊定廢了。亦還是有名無實的。不過我們雖不提議廢止。日人仍將提議擴充。我們要毅然拒絶其無理的要挾。不可一誤再誤。</p>

<p>南斯拉夫京城　南斯拉夫各報謂七月二十五日維也納事變、乃係德國所玩之把戲、至於所以選擇奥國駐意公使林德倫爲其工具、則因林德倫與國社主義較爲接近、且因林德倫駐節意大利、與墨索里尼過從較爲親密、德國希望遇必要時、林德倫或能勸令墨索里尼勿派軍隊干涉也、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>防軍五六萬從事操演</p>
<p>羅馬　德副總理巴本之被任爲駐奥德使、現引起羅馬各界之不少批評、衆指希特勒未先徵求維也納同意、而遽發表巴本使奥之任命一舉、乃非常方法、異於外交習慣、巴本是否負有和平使命、抑其駐節維也納、僅爲德國方面積極行爲、欲奥國成國社黨化之先聲、意國人士對此頗費猜測、意政府雖以奥國大局、並未引起國際糾紛爲滿意、但對於德國殊不信任、决計不稍懈奥邊防變之戒備計劃、外間傳説、意政府已陳兵與南斯拉夫國邊界、但羅馬官塲指此説爲絶無根據、（廿九日路透電）</p>
<p>羅巴　據非官塲估計、現集中於意奥邊界附近之意軍、連輕坦克車隊與砲隊在内、約有五六萬人、此項軍隊早已集於邊境、在通入奥境之兩要塞處從事於山戰之訓練、故以實際言、並非調動、今政府不曰軍隊在邊界野操、而曰派軍隊赴邊防變、蓋有政治作用在焉（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>維也納　茵斯勃魯克城人士相信意國軍隊、現密集於波爾柴諾及勃倫納山隘一帶、其中有一各色隊伍混合編成之隊、駐紥勃倫納與伊薩戈兩山隘之間、一俟接得警報、卽可用汽車運輸之便利、開往茵斯勃魯克城及德國巴維耶、與奥國交界之處、該隊備有坦克車若干輛及過山大砲、在一小時以内、可以開抵茵斯勃魯克城、三小時内可至德國邊界、該區意軍司令係巴維尼將軍、巴氏曾於本年春季前赴奥國、與德國巴維耶地方交界處視察甚詳云、現茵斯勃魯克城人士以爲德國希特勒總理旣採取妥恊態度、則意大利當不致以武力干涉云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>南拉斯夫如釋重負</h3>
<p>南拉斯夫京城　南拉斯夫政界前聞意國軍隊已開入奥國邊境、頗爲惶急、嗣後因知此項消息全屬訛傳、且奥國政府軍隊已克復喀拉甘福與勃某堡二城、因此此間政界人士業已安心、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>）匈軍集西陲備萬一</h3>
<p>匈京　傳聞匈牙利軍隊已集中奥匈邊境、但其性質純爲防範意外起見、此種傳聞係得自素稱消息靈通方面、惟無法加以徵實、又内務部長頃已下令、對於炸藥及燃燒物品之販賣消費、加以更嚴厲之監督、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英法意對奥事步調殊難一致</h3>
<p>意不願聯英法對德抗議</p>
<p>表示各有行動自由之權</p>
<p>羅馬　使者報撰文評論奥國事變、其文字聞係直接出於首相墨索里尼之授意、故意京人士對於該報結論、特别注重、結論略謂、「他國政府苟向柏林提出交涉、意大利决不參加、此層已無待贅述、則以德國政府食言而肥、屢見不鮮故也、」又謂「時至今日、各國政府對於德國皆有恢復完全自由行動之權利」云云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　英法意三國對於奥國問題、現仍繼續交換意見、遇必要時、或將向德國提出交涉、以保證奥國之獨立、但此項交涉將出以何種形式、現尙絲毫無從知悉、埃克西有報頃將三國所採立塲、予以説明、其言曰、「倫敦方面、曾一度傾向於召集國聯會行政院之議、現則顯然採取觀望態度、羅馬方面、似已不復準備根據四强公約、由意法美三國會同向德國提出交涉、而主張實事求是、不作空言、至於法國聞曾亦傾向於召集國聯會行政院一途、但現亦顯然抱觀望態度、總之三國於表明任何態度之前、皆待覓得一種共同可能之塲合」云云、小日報謂、意國對於奥國事變注視宵懈、故立時之危險爲之消散、「但若意國單獨出而干涉、則其危險殊甚、現爲預防事變起見、當由英法意三國合作、使人遵守條約」云云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意德報紙互訐</h3>
<p>意報鼓煽軍事行動</p>
<p>德國輿論不甘沉默</p>
<p>（柏林）　自今日始德國報紙對於意大利報紙對德之攻訐、已開始公開反攻、彼等所採取之態度大致似爲德國輿論以前之沈默不言、若長此繼續、恐將爲人誤以爲德國已默認其罪云、地方指示報今日社論稱、「意大利報紙近數日來所披露之論調、實屬不可加以寛恕、及不可思議之事、意大利報紙全體之社論、莫不謂意大利已準備維護奥國之獨立、卽訴諸武力亦在所不惜云、卽半官機關如意大利日報者亦公然要求、「事實不尙空言」云、柏林八句鐘晚報者對於新自由報所載意大利軍隊行動之紀載、有如下之聲明、「意大利輿論近數日來之論調爲軍事行動、或有比之外交行動較勝一籌之處、實則二者俱無所用之、因德國干涉奥國内政之説、實意大利報紙面壁之虚構、其所根據者、卽論説家腦中之空想而已云云、柏林日報今日之論説亦稱、「自星期五以來、意大利之報紙已一致本「實行不在空言、」爲彼等之標語、但不知彼等所謂實行者尙係根據於空想上者也、（二十八國民）</p>

惟當時交涉進行，曲折甚多，而全路通車與否，爭持尤烈，祗以我方情勢必收復唐榆段路綫，恢復唐榆段交通之後，戰區善後始終有辦法，停戰恊定，始成意義。故當局於熟權利害之後，勉允暫爲保留，約定於去年十月間，另行商議。經此周折、唐榆段路綫方得於去秋八月十三日實行收復，直通榆關。旋以種種事故，十月間開始商議之約，始未克實現，遷延至今·對外關係·隔閡殊甚。且通車旣屬軍事善後問題之一，而停戰恊定之性質，根本旣不涉政治，是爲去年以來華北停戰外交全部之法律根據。本局職司鐵路交通，更無權涉及鐵路業務以外之事件，故此次辦理通車，純著意於交通技術之運用，依照國際最近關於，「郵運」問題所决定之原則，與承認問題，毫無干涉，當無所用其疑慮。加以此項通車事務由純粹商業性質之東方旅行社承辦，文書往返，手續接觸，由本局與該社直接辦理，根本不涉及外交政治之範圍，更絶無慮及事實承認之餘地也。」　　本社派往該處服務之重要職員，因而未能即行召回，致人事方面，頗感支絀，且本社向爲單純商業機關，今不得已而參加此項混合組織，自問經騐尤感缺乏，故已向鐵道部鄭重聲明，祗允勉力担任以半年爲期，俾得早卸仔肩，以免覆餗貽譏也。謹溯旣往，以明眞相，并貢短言，惟希公鑒中國旅行社啟、二三、七、二七、讀書問答私生活與理想（二）　　——答蕭靜娟女士曁羅方君　　這是一個笑話，但它恰恰説明了由頭腦製造出來希望的不可靠，那祗是一種幻想，一個夢。把幻想，把夢當做「理想」的人，尤其在今日這個轉換的時代，實在爲數不少。一個作布店學徒的人抱着作全國棉布大王的「理想」，那也無異「乞丐」的夢了。自然它無實現的可能。一個布店學徒，靠着用勤儉刻苦做一個永不失業的店友總可説是一個可能實現的「理想」罷！那也不見得。因爲經濟的恐慌所驅逐的工作者大致都是勤儉的人們啊！這和種希望雖然在過去可算是有實現性的，但在今日也幾乎等於乞丐作夢了。　　眞正的「理想」是以實踐作基礎的。一個店員對於自已將來生活的「理想」，不是玄而又玄·冠冕堂皇的希望而是把自已作的大衆的一份子，在整個社會的實踐的前提下（即大的理想），正確估量自已的能力，在自已的私生活中，規定自已努力的目標、作爲個人生活的「理想」。個人的「理想」總是構成大衆共同「理想」之一部份的，否則，它就游離了「實踐」變成「凡俗」的了。一個有高尙「理想」的人，不僅是一個有思想的人，他的個人的「理想」，同時就是大衆的「理想」，他除了這種共同「理想」外，没有什麽是「個人的」存念。這自然是最醒悟的份子。　　所謂「理想」與事實每每不符，是一句凡俗的話，缺乏眞實性。這句話的錯誤的來源大致是把「理想」看得太「凡俗」了。因爲「理想」總高過「現實」，否則，就不算什麽「理想」了。從現實達到「理想」的道路，（現實與幻想間並無道路，因爲幻想不能有終點的。）是一條很艱辛的險途。許多不慣跋涉險阻小經的人，以爲現實與理想間也是可以躺在汽車裏一會兒就達到了的。當他看到道路的崎嶇，就大呌「理想與事實不符」起來。還有的人把理想神秘化了。譬如，他把理想中的革命者看做是一個不變的脱離乃一切世俗的神；把自已的愛人看作是一個「故事」裏的人物，祗會愛不會變的動物；把一切理想都弄成了魔術，雖然理想的本身具有實現的可能性，但他是仍會回到觀念論的迷魂陣裏去的，不能將這可能性變爲必然性。　　以上的解釋，不　知能否滿足蕭羅二君之望？蕭羅二君在過去所抱的理想是否合於科學的涵義，我希望二君加以自檢。以下我們要繼續談如何達到我們的理想了，這就是關於所謂私生活的問題、（未完）輪船進口預告　　七月）利生　二十日津烟來怡和泳平　二十日福州來招商和生　三十日奥港來怡和武昌　三十日長江來太古江和　三十日宜昌來怡和茄菲德　三十日日本來大　江新　三十日長江來招商寧靜　三十日長江來寗紹普安　三十日普陀來招商新銘　三十日津烟來招商遇順　卅一日粤汕來招商怡生　卅一日青島來怡和捷陞　卅一日福州來怡和平和　卅一日長江來怡和江安　卅一日長江來招商　　（八月）重慶　一日汕頭來太古太原　一日厦港來太古大通　一日長江來太古新順天　一日津烟來太古吉和　一日長江來怡和達耳得娘　一日香港來法郵四川　二日青島來太古山東　二日港汕來太古長沙　二日長江來太古德和　二日長江來怡和澤生　二日粤港來怡和新寳興　二日長江來三北湖北　三日福州來太古蘆州　三日連生來太古黄浦　三日長江來太古明生　三日青島來怡和定生　三日津烟來怡和輪船出口報告　　寗波班新北京三十日　太古寗紹　三十日　寗紹鴻興　三十日　達興寗興　卅一日　三　新江天　卅一日　招商　　長江班順天　三十日　太古瑞和　三十日　怡和建國　三十日　招商吉　　卅一日　太古公和　卅一日　怡和長興　卅一日　三北武昌　一日　太古紅和　一日宜昌　怡和寧靜　一日　寗紹江新　一日　招商嘉禾　一日重慶　怡和江安　二日　招商大通　二日　太古吉和　二日　怡和長沙　三日　太古德和　三日　怡和新寧興　三日　三北黄浦　四日　太古平和　四日長沙　怡和　　北洋班盛京　三十日青烟津太古蘇州　三十日青島　太古利生　卅一日威煙津怡和和生　卅一日青島　和怡普安　卅一日青島　招商新銘　一日威烟津　　重慶　一日煙津　太古新順天　三日青烟津　太古山東　三日青島　太古澤生　三日青島　怡和湖北　四日連牛　太古　　南華班綏陽　三十日汕港粤太古怡生　卅一日汕港粤怡和太原　一日厦港粤太古　東　二日汕港粤太古芝尼加拿　二日厦港爪漳華遇順　二日厦港粤招商四川　三日汕港粤太古明生　三日汕港粤怡和蘆州　四日厦港粤太古　　揚州班海　　卅一日　　　廣濟　四日　　　　　　福州班萬象　三十日　三北泳平　卅一日　招商捷陞　三日　怡和　　　安陽平班新瑞平一日　瑞平法滬興瑞平　六日　楚瑞平滬興　　通揚班大和　三十日　大　正大　三十日　大　大慶　卅一日　大通鴻大　卅一日　大　大豫　一日　大達隆大　一日　大　志大　二日　大達大通　二日　大　　　温台班府山　三十日定穿海聯安達　　卅一日定石海聯安穿山　一日穿石台聯安益利　二日定坎温聯安大華　三日定坎温聯安台州　四日定石台聯安　　香港小吕宋　亞洲皇后三十日　昌興胡佛　卅一日　大來格關脱　八日　美郵　　歐洲郵船班脱臘武　四日亨　美最時　拉　四日亨　　亨　喀萃奇　七日倫敦　大美達耳得娘十一　寳　法　　　太平洋輪船班日本粤后卅日温哥　　　克利扶倫四日　　山大格　脱廿二日西雅圖美郵　　　　　菲茄德　卅一日　大　春秋御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　那幾個被指定着服侍我們的太監，除掉替我們整理衣服而外，每天晚上，還得澈夜的留在我們那一輛車的兩端侍候着。要如我們有什麽吩咐，他們便立去辦’－當然他們也是輪流值班的。他們更絶對的不許向我們隨便説話，除非我們有事先去問他們，他們才收回答；否則眞有連大氣也不敢喘的樣子。可是他們有時候却常和那些宫女們説話，這裏所謂説話，當然不是戲謔，而且他們總是凑没有人見的時候，才偷偷的説上幾句；因爲要如他們彼此間説話得太親密了，太后往往就會知道，經伊一知道，這禍便闖得大了！伊會立卽敎人把那宫女拖來，當着許多人的面前，剥下了伊的下衣，用很粗的竹板，打上幾十下。而那太監呢？更不能這樣優待他了，總是立即身首異處的。　　我們八個女官雖然也有一輛特備的車佔着，然而在事實上，我們都不大到那車上去的，除非需用什麽東西，或到了晚上想睡覺才回去，餘下的時間，我們都得到太后的車上去靜悄悄的候着。因爲我們雖然已有兩個人輪流的在太后跟着服侍着，但伊也許會突然想到某一個不上班的人　；所以我們凡逢不上班的時候，也得肅靜無聲地留在伊那輛車的一間小房子裏，恭候宣召。那情形眞有些像在醫生的待診室裏等候診治的病人，不過我們是不准坐下來的，只能躺在地氈上，或斜靠在壁上，稍事休息。　　在這列御用火車上，我們已經算是很造化的了，祗有我們，－八個女官，和光緒，隆裕，瑾妃，以及慶善，勛齡等幾個人是可以坐的；但也有個限制，第一必須在我們自已的車上，如其在太后車上的話，那就非得伊臨時特許不可。所以我們在路上都覺得很疲倦，雖然沿路的景物確是非常的新奇悦目，祗恨我們的腿力太不濟了！（九三）山東府綢  拾玖　　山東府綢是向來有名的。它的色澤雖不能敵杭紡，然因其耐穿，并且越洗越白，所以把它做大衫的也有，做小衫褲等的也有。在交通便利，市面繁盛之區，如蘇杭等處，一到四五月裏，常見有一輩大漢，徘徊街市，把臂上所披的絲織品向人兜售：他們背上還負著一個布包，裏面貨色，好壞都有。這些人都是趕碼頭，販府綢的客人。　　自從洋貨絲綢侵進了都市而後，府綢不幸，遂漸歸淘汰之列。只要看現在街上的人，穿府綢大衫或府綢西裝的已漸减少，可見府綢已不爲人所歡迎了。今夏，我在街上看到一輩販府綢的山東客人，大多面有菜色，人們對他睬也不睬，遑論購買。我想那些大漢如果相逢，恐彼此都要大歎苦景罷。　　提倡國貨，這提高了府綢的聲價不少。别的不用説，只消看現在的各機關裏居然也把它做起制服來了，這不能不説是府綢的幸運。可是有人告訴我，日本人現在山東的採用我國原料，重新煉過，織成府綢，向各地推銷，所以府綢的色澤越是光潔，越不是眞正的道地國貨。這話是否確實，我很希望有人加以調查，弄個水落石出。不幸而這話是確實的，那末日本人施行經濟侵略的手段，眞是可怕啊！妻的職業  醉痴生　　對門的小王，失業至今，已經三年多了。「坐吃山空」，於是他的一切生活，都感着大大的不景氣，隨處顯露着窘態。他的妻子，當然不能例外，也受着同等的遭遇。伊心裏雖羡慕都市的虚榮，但丈夫不賺錢，也是没法。平日不過布袍一襲，聊以章身。「摩登」二字，究没有享受的資格。　　不知怎樣？小王的妻，近來忽態度大變，大非昔比。脱却古樸的青布衫，換上鮮艷的綢旗袍。足踏高跟皮鞋，手提西式革囊。眉毛兒彎嘴唇兒紅。伊本來是有幾分姿色的，再加上這樣的裝飾，自然分外顯得妖嬈。那嬌軀扭動起來，誘人的肉感，眞像靈蛇般的舒展。不要説小王的朋友見了，都垂着涎嘖嘖稱奇。就是左右隣居，也有些莫明其妙。説：小王仍舊没有謀着職業，怎麽他的妻子，會這樣的出風頭呢？倒是個疑問！　　至於伊的「起居注」，更大爲改變了。每日終要睡到日上三竿，纔得起身。午後五六點鐘出去，到了深夜二三點鐘回來。或是澈夜不歸，也説不定。平日小王爲了經濟問題，終免不了和伊鬥嘴。現在却唯唯諾諾，言聰計從。小王身上的衣服，雖比從前整潔些。但究没有做伊「侍從武官」的資格：當出門的時候，總是分道揚鑣。没有携手同行。倘是走在一地兒，大可以掉兩句文：呌做「彩鳳隨鴉，齊大非偶」。　　一天夜裏，不知爲了什麽關係。小王和妻大鬧特鬧，甚至駡伊是爛污貨。伊却振振有詞：説你不要臉的東西，自已不會賺錢，靠着妻子賺錢度日。倘不是老娘犧牲精神與靈肉大腿，你肚臍眼裏，會磞出來嗎？説得小王只是嘆氣，啞口無言。陶尔斐斯之死  士英東北四連長  張恨水著　　第三十二回　聲色自娱將軍於日樂老少環泣戰士幾人回　　全師長道：他的營長呌什麽名字，你知道嗎？江氏道：我不大清楚，只聽説姓寳，大概是在旗吧，全師長點點這：這就是了，不錯的。你們怎麽會一點消息都不知道。江氏也急了，紅着臉道：怎麽了？師長！全師長道：也不怎麽樣，不過這個營長在我的手下辦過事。你那姑娘認識字嗎？江氏道：認識幾個字，也没進過學堂。全師長道：這就好。你回去告訴你姑娘，哭明天買一分報瞧瞧。將來若有要我帮忙的地方，我願隨時帮你的忙。好啦，没什麽事，你回去罷。江氏聽説，便轉身要走。全師長又招着手道：你回來，我還有兩句話問你。江氏聽説，只得站定了。全師長道：你那親家翁，現時住在那兒？江氏道：這裏就是他家，我不過到他們家來作客人的。全師長道：他多大年紀？江氏道：他六十多啦。全師長嘆了一口氣。江氏道：没什麽事嗎？我告辭了。全師長點點頭江氏就走了。他對於全師長這一番行動，却有些不明白，回家悄悄的對桂枝説了。桂枝心裏想着，全師長分明是個酒色之徒，無論他怎麽樣子説，也不會有好意，自然總還是遠避爲是，因道：他旣然呌咱們買分報瞧，咱們明天早上就買一分報瞧瞧罷。江氏也不解他勸人買報看是什麽意思。到了次日早上，親自跑出去，將大小報買了三四分帶回家來，送到桂枝屋子裏去。桂枝總辐家那小報先入爲主的印象，首先將一份小報展了開來，早有一行大字，射入眼簾，喜峰口外平安堡前晚失陷。這不由桂枝心裏連連跳了幾下。再看那大題目之下，附有小題目，守軍寳營有壯烈的犧牲。這更讓桂枝心房極力的跳躍，幾乎要由口腔子裏硬跳了出來（四四四）　　這樣一來，人家纔漸漸明白了。原來小王的妻，在××舞塲當一名舞女，過那摟抱的生涯。新中國畫在夏天  南丁　　蘇州星社社員陶冷月君，將歷年作畫心得，倡造新中國畫一種，設色筆法，皆新穎别致，全幅顔色，純以花青一色畫成，分遠近深淡，層次井然。此種新中國畫，尤宜於夏季三伏之中，一卷披閲，最能消暑却慮，眼目爲之一清。因夏季苦暑，凡目力可及之一切景像，忌紅黄諸色以青藍兩色，最爲適宜，觀之可以身心清凉，此爲任何人所公認。故每至夏季，凡房屋牆壁，家具物件，以青藍之色者爲佳，而電燈之上亦罩以藍色燈泡燈罩，公園山林之中，所以能消夏却暑者，亦以多青草綠葉，可以使其身心一場也。陶君之新中國畫，旣完全以青藍設色，自最適宜於夏季矣。如此江山  隠　　焦山自在菴藏有湯貞愍公如此江山圖手卷，名人題跋甚多，葉玉虎有一長跋，評近代畫家，以貞愍曾孫定之爲海内第一。菴主某僧，亦能畫，葉君面允代素定之畫第二圖，不知此段已告成熟否。余與湯葉二君，無一面緣，不敢不借貴報爲名山乞名畫也。婦女的樂園婦女常識的留聲機  潘詠流女士　　日子過得眞快，自已不覺已做了第二個孩子的母親了。記得在未婚的以前，對人世是多麽的糢糊啊！我想一般不曾經過某一生活階段的青年女子，也許都是一樣！不甚關心做母親的常識吧？　　是一個殘冬的夜，我的女友麗文－伊是一個學醫而感到生理學興趣的人。在我的寢室裏和我圍爐，天氣嚴寒的夜，我是最愛吃花生的醬油豆乾的，一爐蓬蓬勃勃的火，一壺濃濃的熱茶，慢慢地剥着花生，一粒花生米，一口醬油豆乾，這樣幽閒的恬淡空間中的我們，談興是特别起勁的，我愛讀文藝小説，所以話材十之八九是小説中的故事，伊呢？不用説老是生理衛生關於醫學的一套，伊的談線拖到做母親的常識上來了，伊説：　　從前德國有一個家庭，家長－媳婦的婆婆，是個性子最固執的人，伊對大媳婦連生了三個男孩子，都是先後害着同樣的病死了，做父親的當然是很悲痛的，這樣也就引起了他不可理解的懷疑，懷疑造成了他請名醫去研究的動機，醫生把那三個死孩子統掘起來，細細的解剖，檢騐的結果，每個孩子的胃裏面都有一團黑而硬的血塊。經了幾次的化騐，都不能斷論結黑塊的理由，後經醫生細問孩子起病之前，家庭裏發生過吵鬧没有，孩子的父親被這一問，登時觸發了他的回憶，他忽然醒悟的説道，啊！不錯，每個孩子起病之前，我的母親都和妻子大鬧過一塲氣。醫生這時才大膽的診斷：帶乳的母親是不能受氣的，受氣是最易使血起變化，血的變化，當然會影響到乳的，孩子胃裏的硬血塊的結果，是血起了變化的原因，嗣後他們分居了，組織了小家庭，以後生的孩子都好好的養活了」。　　伊説完了這個常識故事，的確引起了我特别濃厚的興趣，我斟了一盃茶給伊喝，同時要求伊再講一個有趣的故事，伊一面在喝茶，一面在思索，最後伊又開始講了。　　的確，中國的人口生産率，恐怕趕不上死亡率的，天災人禍，且不用説，死在没有科學常識的關係上，怕也不在少數，且就我們女子生育方面説，因生産而死的，在我們鄉村裏是很流行的，而文化的國人，每用神鬼和命運去解釋，也只有説其愚不及也！　　此外我們貴國傳統的禮敎觀念；也是科學的桎桔，使它不能發展和應用，的確遺害到生族的健康問題，一般做父母的不但對婚前的子女不敎以相當的性智識，反而認爲這是可恥的事，以至造成了許多青年期内的男女盲動，害性病的，及危害子女而不自覺的，我現在舉個例來説吧，常有哺乳期間的母親，和丈夫行房事時，孩子哭了，當時就把乳給孩吃，要曉得這是最危險不過的，此時婦人體内的血，週身在起變化，直接會影響乳的，所以孩子往往會因此而害病」。　　麗文給我的生理衛生常識很多。因爲篇幅的關係，不能一一寫出。最後，我想在這裏向我們的姊妹們，做一回留聲機，或者不爲無益吧。</p>

<p>經濟專刊日本水産品傾銷的檢討  若搴　　食糧的對於人類，有着密接的關係；古語所説「民可百年無貨，不可一朝無食；」並且照近世分析的結果，那末一般人通常的全部消費中，食品的消費要占全部百分之四十。而水産品在食品中的成份，却也要占其中的四分之一。所以産生水産品的水産業，當然是值得注意的事。吾國有四萬萬多的人口，需要量的廣大，决不能使吾們忽略了去；何况事實上，吾們還有百萬以上的國人，直接靠着水産業而生存！　　然而今日吾國水産業的情形如何呢？報紙上也早就登載着海盜的縱横，漁村的破産，以及整個水産業的崩潰。更使人痛心而驚懼的，乃是我國水産品的充斥於市塲；尤其是日本水産的大量傾銷。少説些每年也有價值幾百萬元的水産品，從國人的口裏吃下去，也就是每年有幾百萬元的金錢，從國人的手裏流出去同時薄弱了民衆的經濟基礎。增長了日本的侵略資本。至於吾們數百萬的漁民生計，直接受他摧殘至無立錐餘地。講到日本水産品傾銷的方式以及輸入的數字，本篇是簡略了，（如果讀者要明瞭的話，請參閲中國經濟研究會出的「中國經濟」月刋今年的第二卷第五期上拙著，「從漁業方面觀察各國在華之經濟勢力」一文，有較詳的陳述。）在此祗能檢討日本水産品爲什麽向吾國傾銷，以及吾們怎樣的抵制而已。　　大家多知道日本水産品是極度的向吾國傾銷，可是何以竟發生這種趨向？那的確是原因繁多。但是綜合的説，那就是因爲他國内價格的低落，要維持市價，不得不向外傾銷，這就是所謂弱性的傾銷；第二那是因爲日本有侵略吾整個水産業的野心，向傾銷的方策謀打倒吾國水産業的復興，這又是所謂强性的傾銷了。現在吾們姑且詳細的分析一下：　　第一，當然是爲了自身生産過剩的關係。近年來日本的水産　事業是迅速發展，生産的多，遠超過他消費的可能。最近五年（民十七至二十一年）日本平均的全國水産總生産額有四萬萬　　千萬元，去年竟至五萬萬元。所以像運到中國來的東洋鹹魚（即薩門魚，學名爲鮭），在日本國内簡直任你價格降到極低，也没有人要買。如果在北海道一帶生産鮭魚的地方，更是多至不值一文，但是他們的漁民在這種時代，也是不能以物易物。所以爲維持他們的生計，就不得不要求出售，於是乃成立了這對外傾銷的一途。　　第二，日本近年來的水産製造業，是異常　達。他們的魚糧（Fi　h　ineel）製造工業　創始至今還没有幾年，可是眞所謂突飛猛進的發展。單以輸出額而言：一九三一年輸出數量是萬九千一百十二噸，價值二百三十二萬九千０十元；而去年竟躍爲四萬八千一百七十七噸，價值四百三十三萬六千０十六元；此外如各種水産罐頭的生産，去年總計有三百二十一萬五千一百八十二箱，價值五千六百０九萬四千八百四十一元，照這樣的大規模生産，結果當然不能不向外傾銷，何况國内因生産過多而市價低落，好像半磅圓形的鯧魚罐頭在消費市塲上也祗賣一角錢一罐，當然促成了向外的趨勢，這種趨勢，美國哥侖比亞大學敎授克拉克的學説，已很足以説明，他説，大規模生産下的固因資本極大，因此而必需盡量生産；但是如果本國不能接受這種巨量的供給，於是祗有以本國需要以外的數量，去負担固定資本的百分之幾的一小部份，去向國外傾銷如此則旣可吸收外國一部的金融，同時維持國内　貨品的市價，並且還减少了這百分之幾的固定資本。所以傾銷的現像是大規模生産下必然的結果。現在日本的水産　製造業　天一天的向　這方面進展，當然是促成了向外傾銷。　　第三，要提到爲什麽他們要向中國來傾銷？不待思索可斷定的，就是中日地位　上的關係。中日民族是比較的接近，所　他的産品，就大多能適合了國人的嗜好。而　前中國經濟界的崩潰，日趨嚴重，尤其是水産經濟的不寗，水産市塲，大部是成爲國際水産品逐鹿的市塲。日本以地理上近在咫尺的關係，因爲運費等各種費用的低廉，多是助成日人傾銷的因子；何况中國没有政治軍事上的保障，當然日人輕而易舉的向我傾銷了。　　第四，爲謀拓展市塲的關係，我們多曉得日本的水産品在中國商埠方面，占有極大的勢力。可是近年商埠的情形也在衰落，他們不能不更向吾國内地去　出路；然而近年來中國豐村經濟的破産，使内地居民的購買力，絶形薄弱。日本水産品旣謀向内地發展，　　就藉傾銷之方法，使水産品能以價格的　　　　　進暢銷了。况目日本水産業的趨勢，原　　　市價低落的市塲交易，　易於永久操　　　塲，所以就實行向外國傾銷的事態。　　第五，是爲排斥競爭者的關係　日本因地理上的方使，所以對中國的貿易，絶形發達。但是從九一八事變發生以後，中國人民對於購買日貨，最低也有相當的警戒。同時其他帝國主義者，多乘這個機會，竭力把他們的貨品到吾國來推銷，大家都鋭意競爭，謀獨占市塲。好像美國水産當局極注意的調查吾國漁業情形；像上海等埠水産品的運輸情形：水産消費的數量價值；以及各方面需要供給的情形：在在多爲詳實的調查。並且時常有水産罐頭運來，廉價求售，近來美國的薩門魚罐頭在上海是很容易發見的了。再如英國加拿大的鹹青川魚，在中國的銷路，原極順利；而自從中俄復交以後，俄産的鮭罇鹹魚（即鹹薩門魚），也降價求售，並且每次進口數量的多，有時簡直可以獨占市塲的需要，像去年九月十六日華順號輪船進口，就運來了五萬四千六百六十三箱，價值三十餘萬元。各國如此的來搶奪吾國的水産市塲，日本爲謀保持他原有的地位，不得不設法驅逐他的競爭者，所以又促進了他積極的盡量傾銷的野心。　　第六，爲世界經濟恐慌與關税政策的關係。歐洲大戰以後，結果各國多感到内在的疲弊，而不得不發達他國内的産業：加以近年經濟界的不景氣，仍是愈演愈烈；所以必須防止外國競爭品的侵入。像美國是靠着歐戰而發達的國家，可是目前也是經濟恐慌到點；而外國水産品（如日本的蟹罐，　罐，冷凍館等多是盡量輸往）的輸入增加，和自身的輸出衰落，所以爲防止國内水産品的過乘與經濟界的不振，乃致對外國輸入品不得不謀以高税。最近從藍　運動發生以後，對水産工業，極爲注意，羅斯福　統即宣佈賄魚沙丁魚等水産罐頭進口税的增高，同時全國漁業界極力宜稱：「希望美總統能立即對於已入於危險之國内工業，加以救濟而實行禁止或限制外貨之進口」。於是首當其衝的就是日本的水産品。此外如英國，一向爲傳統的目由貿易者，乃於一九三一年起因爲勞働黨與保守黨的提携，竟將食糧品的輸入，也課至百分之十的税率。而法國對於日本蟹罐的輸入，也予以限制，照法國議會中的提案，是以去年十一月　輸入實數的七成　　　，對於日本輸入的一萬五百箱中，祗能自由輸入其四分之一，其他的四分之三，　　法國製品作爲交換條件。日本的水産品　　　　　壁，爲求自身的出路計，更不得不　五　　。　　第七，是爲阻止中國水産事業的復，這一點，我們應該絶對的注意。吾國近年來對於水産事業，雖不能説對於事實上，有了何等重大的發展，　是較之以往，的確是已受人重視。最低度言，政府方面在設法計劃着　部份漁業建設的工作；同時社僵早，也有一部份的企業家對此發生興趣，很多已在新式漁業方面進行着，這的確是一種先潮，不久當然可獲得相當的結果。相信在今日情勢之下，如果没有阻礙，漁村是能够安定的，生産是能够豐盛的，同時産銷運輸多能够平穏發展，那是日本野心的漁業界所能認受的麽？所以乘吾們尙在初期進行的時候，將他們的水産品削價傾銷，務使吾國的漁産，不能同他競爭，没有在市塲推銷的可能，這樣我們的漁民不是要無以維持生活了麽？不是漁業也要根本的破産了麽？　這就是日本水産必須向吾傾銷的最大原因。　　上述的七點，可説已能够决定日本水産品的不得不向外傾銷，更不得不向中國傾銷。中間有自動的關係，有被動的關係，所以才有這樣盛大的傾銷狀態。目下雖已有這幾千萬元的剥削，可是以後，上述各問題的漸趨嚴重，更作大規模的傾銷：其程度的遠　於今日，那是　以肯定的。　　日本水産品傾銷的結果，受害最烈的，當然是有直接關係的中國水産界。日本水産品價格的低落，於是不特能在通商口岸暢銷，即是内地及原有漁業的集散地，竟也是充斥於市塲；不説别的，像素稱江浙四大舊式漁業集中地之　的江陰，近年也充滿日貨，每年也要有十萬元的交易，以致使魚價紛亂，市面蕭條，使吾國漁民汗血得來的生産，也不得不跌價求售，結果是不得不虧本了。如果是富有的漁民，他們多願意改行，已可以使漁業突然的中落；可是吾國舊有漁業的漁民，他　經業資本，多是出之於借貨的，他們工作的希望祗在於漁期結束，除還債以外，能堪　年溫飽，最大的希望，也祗在於明年的行漁資本的獲得而已。現在内外貨的傾銷，使生産價值，不能抵償借貸的數字，　還能要他安心從事漁業麽？改進當然更談不到，所能够看到，祗是漁業的總崩潰？　　我們再説得範圍小一點。日本傾銷的水産品，旣是以　吃乾魚類爲主腦，使舊有水産製造業，同時也即是漁民最重要的副業）感受無限的　　　好像浙江外海的岱山，幸爲吾國著名的黄魚鮝産地，江浙兩省數百萬的黄魚生産，除鮮食者外，都運到那裏製造，該地共有大小製鮝廠一百多家，其銷路，除江浙而外，其他如廣東，福建，湖北，江西等，多能够暢銷的。但是近年的情形却不能如此了；作者去年去調查的時候，眞是家家呌苦，看他們的範圍，一年比一年小了，營業是毫無起色，雖則他們的製造法營業法等多有着内在的缺點，可是産品賣不出好價錢，眞是重要的原因，譬如黄魚鮝成本，自鮮魚收價，用鹽税欵，以及鹽漬，曬乾，裝包等的土地租價，人工勞資等等的費用，每百斤也要算到十元左右，再加運費等到達市塲自然要超過十元，可是日本的鹹魚每百斤，最低時祗要七元，况且鹹魚商販賣國産與日産的結果，也是以販賣日産獲利較厚，因此市面上是日産多於國産，加以民衆購買力的薄弱，就捨吾而趨他，也所以使舊有水産製造業的破産，這還不是受日本水産品傾銷的影響麽　　如果説得嚴重一些，那末近年民間購買力的趨於薄弱，不能不説牠也是促成這現象的一份子。日本水産品傾銷在市塲的，其價格低廉，一般民衆，一方面固然因爲不曉得是日貨而購食，但是實際的减少消費價值，那一個的心裏不是歡喜貪便宜的，何况還有奸商從中朦蔽呢？這種漏巵，每年也達千萬元，不更助長了他們的侵略資本麽？吾國民衆經濟的基礎，不也是被他吸收了破壞了麽？歷年購買力的漸趨薄弱，就因爲這種生産資本的流往國外，水産品是民食上必需的消費，不是更有着巨大的影響麽？啊，眞不堪設想！總之，這是影響於我們整個民族的，我們也不願意多取例子，吾人所希望的，祗在於努力解除這種危險：勢成燃眉，没有人願意再看牠的發揚滋長吧！　　這樣來抵禦呢？難道是我們束手待斃麽？不，我敢决定不，我們現代的民衆，是要國家民族復興的民衆。那末，如何設法抵禦呢？救急還是脱不了關税問題。吾人以爲在編訂税則之時，對於各項進口的水産品，應該作個别的研究：好像某項水産品，中國的生産情形如何？市塲的需要如何？對於内地的運銷如何？外國輸入的情形如何？侵害的程度如何？直接的影響如何？抵制以後可以有何項國産品代替？凡此種問題，而能一一得有答案，那時所定的税率，我們才覺得有相當的效果。否則對於重要的輸入品，同時是市面最大的消費，却定了輕的税率；　對於無關緊要的貨品，却增加到很高的税率，那事實上，恐怕也不能得實際的功效。好像最近修正的税率中，把魚翅進口的税率反而减低，這似乎就犯了這個毛病。所以我們以爲增加税率，也應該也經過一步切實的調查統計和研究的工作。否則，更加使本國水物一敗塗地　刦不復的了。水産品在關税問題中，狠占着重要的地位，本文因爲篇幅關係，不能詳論。　　至於治本方面，那是更不能空言可以成功的。如果不把本國水産業加以整理與開發，這仍是根本没有辦法抵制的。譬如説，日本水産品拒絶進口了，國内有什銷水産品可以代替？簡直很難有滿意的答復。近來日本水産品的所以充斥市塲，一半也是因爲本國水産品的不能滿足市塲需要，以致發生這許多利令智昏的奸商。至於如何整理與開發事國的水産業，那是國内水産專家，早有詳密的廣大計劃，鴻論卓見，散見於各報章雜誌，作者不願多示意見，兹先擇急需者列大綱如後：　　（一）爲開發水産資源，必先調查海洋狀况增闢漁塲：　　（二）爲水産品銷路的流暢，必先設立魚市塲管理分配；　　（三）爲水産經濟的融通，必先舉辦漁業銀行低利貸欵；　　（四）爲漁獲的增加，必先漁船機械化，漁具科學化；　　（五）爲水産的合理開發，必先整理原有漁業團體組織各項漁業合作社；　　（六）爲外海治安，必先注意勦除海盜，舉辦漁民自衛團，同時更應設法安定漁村；　　（七）爲漁民智識的上進，必先舉辦漁民小學，（作者以爲目前的水産敎育，根本有錯誤的地方，應統注意實際的漁民敎育，另文詳論）　　此外吾人所最應注意的，却是全國水産業的統制問題，這個問題，已經在本刋上討論過，雖則還有很多意見，是本文祗能草草結束了。藍鷹運動中之美國關税政策  譚秉文　　一　弁言　　上十二日路透社電云：「　　　　今日簽定　惠關税案；按此案授權總統與外國判商約，並增减現有税則，以百分之五十爲限一云。　　新關税政策，原係由國務，臣　　氏（　　　　　llull　Socretary　of　　Statc）　　出，於　　　九日在衆議院以　百上十四　對一百一　　通過，隨即爲參議院所同意，再於六月　　日得　統簽署，正式成爲法律，故又稱一赫爾關税法（Hu　ll　Tarirt　Act）。自此法案頒行後，藍鷹運動之精神，始得表現於美國产同業政策中，其重要性不言而喻。　　羅斯　之思所以所革美國關税政策，山來已久，自其登臺之始，即有此意。其端倪旣露於倫敦世界經濟會議席上，時以各國間無誠意故，終未有所作爲，然已提示以改訂税則之必要。五閲月後，汛美會議召集於孟德維都（Montevidea），對於互惠商約談判，原則上接受。自本年正月三十一日美元價值穏定後，此種商約之締訂，更爲之促進。繼於二月十三日，設國際貿易銀行（The　Export-　Import　Bank）　於華盛頓，專司對俄貿易事宜。隨後又有二家同性質之銀行先後成立，其一專對古巴貿易，其二則對其他諸國貿易而設。今次之授大總統以改訂税率，自由簽署商約之權，美國新貿易政策之基礎，於以奠立。　　二　美國關税政策之沿革　　吾人於檢討此新關税政策之先，宜略及美國關税政策之沿革；蓋凡百社會現象之産生，必有　歷史的因素在也。　　美國爲高度保護關税國之典型，夫人而知之。蓋自殖民時代始，美國苦於資本之匱乏，不得不從歐洲諸國借入大宗資金，以開拓其響富之資源。然借債即須還本付息，故不得不實施保護關税，以謀貿易出超，　而資補償。自獨立戰爭後，國内産業漸次發達，爲避免與先進資本主義諸國之競爭故，保護關税之精神，益臻穏固。洎乎今世紀，此種傳統的政策，猶未放棄，惟課税方法益趨複雜化耳。如一九零七年共和黨之佩息關税，在一内外生産費差額之均等化」名目下，將平均從價税率抬高至四０·七三％。一九一二年民主黨之安提華德關税，在「競爭的關税」主義　，關税率减低至　六·九七％。一九　　年更實行所謂「伸縮關税」「科學的關税」（共和黨）提高至三八·　二％。至一九一　０年之荷里斯穆關税法（Hawluy·SmootTariff）共和黨），更　至四一·六四％。而最近頒行之赫爾關税，則　非此關税政策之反動而已，故　靜言之。　　荷里斯穆關税法，係義國於世界經濟恐慌　　采行之關税政策。本法提高或新設關税品　凡八八七　，而減　與豁，　僅　三　　　。其目的係在於一增加國　　人，諒外貿之統制，奬勵合　國之産業，　　　　者。二胡　　統領行　法　之宣言。然本　　交　　　論之際，即遭國内外關係人物之熱烈反對。國　産業界反對最力者，爲汽車大王福特氏，蓋本法將汽車原料七五０種税率提高也。一九三０年五月五日，國内各大學之經濟學者一千零二十八人，以該税則大不合因時制宜之旨，聯　提呈抗議書於議會。同時與美國貿易頻繁之三十餘國，亦提出抗議。然政府昧於事理，一意孤行，終於　九三（年六月十七日通過於議會，翌日起實施。結果諸國莫不紛謀報復：如坎拿大對美國輸入品十二種税率提高，法國亦將汽車及其配件之進　税增高，他如意大利，西班牙，墨西哥，古巴，澳洲等亦相繼謀報復之道。一年間對美實施報復高關税政策者，達二十五國之衆。荷里斯穆關税法案，不啻爲世界貿易戰之導火綫，蓋自斯以後，世界貿易戰之劇烈，爲前　所未見。　　荷里斯穆關税實施後，不僅引起國際間貿易戰之激烈化而已，於其國内經濟，亦有惡影響。對於貿易之衰落也，股票價格之暴跌也，銀行資金之凍結也，勞働者失業數之日协也……諸現象接踵而起，促進國内經濟恐慌之步調。國内有識之士，爲之痛心疾首，一致主張改訂該關税法。其著焉者，爲一九三二年十月國内大學專門學校三十六校之經濟學者一八０名，聯名獻書胡佛總統，曉以利害，請求修改税則。後雖經參衆兩院議决，然遭胡佛總統之拒絶簽署，終未生效。爾後民主黨選舉勝利，始着手改革計劃，至去年年底國務卿赫爾氏提出其具體政策，供議會討論。醞釀旣久，至今年六月中旬，始得見諸實施。　　三　世界貿易之衰落與美國輸出貿易之不振　　溯自　九　九年以降，世界貿易大呈减退。就總輸入額而言，一九二五年爲咕五，六０六，０００，０００元，一九三三年减至一一，五三七，０００，０００元。（註一）據穏健之估計，苟世界貿易按照戰前之速率進行，則去年應遠五百億元，換言之，即較實際上多三十八億　美元。（註二）國際貿易减少三十八億元，結果世界生産額亦不得不减少三十八億元，亦即减少同額之消費量，同樣更使人民生活程度之低降。美國爲世界經濟之一環，且爲國際貿易發達之國，故所受影響亦最鉅。是故美國商業指數，同期中（一九二九年與一九三三年之比較）自一一二·九降至六三。國民明得亦自八三，０三七，０００，０００元减至三八，　四九，０００，０００元。而尤值得吾人注意，厥　美國輸出貿易之衰落。（註三）　　美國主　輸出品之變動狀况　　一九二九年與一九二三年之　　一九二九年　一九三三年　增减率　　數量　價值數量　價值數量　價值　　　　　　　　　·五　一五七　一、六四七　减六六　　　　　　　　　　一四一　－　一二　　　减九一汽車及配件　五三六　八八五　一０八　九一　减八０减九０棉製品　五六四　一三五　二０二　三九　减四六减七一打字機及配件　四二五　一二　一六六　　六减六一　减七四銅　　　　九九八　一八二　三五０　二五　减六五减八六汽油　六０　二六七　二六　五八　减五七减七八機械油　一０、六五三　一０三八、二一　五五　减二四减四七樹脂　一、四三八　二０一、三三　八减一六减六０棉花　三九六二　七七一四、五二三　二九八　减一四减四八猪脂　　八二九　一０六　五八四　二四　减三０减六八烟草　五六六　一四六　四三九　八三　减二三减四三小麥及麵粉　一五四　一九一　二八　一九　减七八减九０輸入總額　　－四、二九七　－　、四四九　－减六七　　（説明）各貨數量單位如下：汽車爲千輛·棉製品爲百萬方碼，打字機爲千架，銅棉花猪脂及烟草爲百萬磅，汽油機械油樹脂爲千桶，小麥及麥粉爲百萬嘝。　　就上表而觀，無論在數量或價值方面，輸出貿易俱大呈减退。且共减退率達八０％乃至九０％者，亦數見不鮮。以上係僅就數種主要商品而言，更就貿易總額而觀，其减退之勢亦不稍遜。一九二九年輸出爲五，二四０，九九五，０００元，輸入爲四，三九九，三六一，０００元，出超額爲八四一，六三四，０００元。一九三三年輸入額爲一，四八二，七六四，０００元，輸入額爲一，三一五，四九七，０００元，出超僅爲一六七，二六七，０００元。其减退額實爲南北戰爭以後所未見。（註四）　　一考美國國際貿易所得，雖僅佔美國全國民所得之十分之一，然其影響於美國之國計民生，至鉅且大，尤其是於農業部門。何則？美國農産品及原料多輸諸海外，舉其皎而要者：美國棉花輸出者約占泰半，烟草佔三分之一，小麥五分之一，猪脂之一半，米之四分之一，……。又上表中所列諸貨品，除棉製品與汽車外，平均每年輸出額佔國内生産額百分之　五以上。（註五）當此等貨品不能銷諸海外，則將成爲國内之滯貨，除任其霉爛於倉棧外，别無用途。苟此種現象繼續存在，則至本年終，美國耕地被迫停止播種之面積，將達四千萬乃至一萬萬英畝。農民旣喪佚購買工業製品之能力，又須向製造品工業部門找尋工作，其影響於製品工業不言而喻。故合衆鋼鐵公司之前經理佛雷氏（Games　Farrel）嘗云：美國人口中，依賴外國貿易以爲生者逾七百萬人，當美國現有失業者數爲一千四百萬人，則其中山於貿易不振而致失業者，當有一半。一（註六）旨哉斯言乎；　　四　赫爾關税及其内容　　赫爾氏將上述世界貿易之衰落，歸因於世界　國間，經濟的厮殺（Economic　Annihilation）之盛行；於美國貿易之不振，則歸咎於荷里斯穆關税法。且究其終極，荷里斯穆關税實爲禍首，蓋世界貿易戰之發生，自美國關税政策轉變後益趨劇烈，旣有如上述。是故爲謀世界貿易之恢復，與振振美國貿易，亦應山美爲並録。登高一呼，天上　　，收效殊宏也。　　赫爾氏之提議書中，開宗明義首句即謂：現今世界上勞働者失業數，約有三千萬之譜，此龐大之人口，自一九二九年以降即天嘗獲得工作。彼等或則凍餒以斃，即　而不致者，亦經喪失購買力，故市塲上失掉此大宗顧客一。彼繼續云：「此外處於」飢餓綫下之貧民，當佔全世界人口總數百分之八十。此等人俱亟有待乎世界貿易之推廣，尤其是美國貿易，蓋美國旣生産大宗農品及原料品，爲後進諸國所必需；又生産鉅量生産貨物，以供彼等建立王業化之用。苟世界各國仍不舍棄，經濟的厮殺」之策，則徒足促進世界經濟機構之崩潰而已。爲恢復世界貿易計，美國應爲前鋒，成立互惠關税，以發揮其過　之生産能力。　　赫爾之理論本平淡無奇，其超特之處在于其實施之手段。兹略述若次。　　曰賦大總統以自由簽訂互惠商約之權，毋庸經議會之通過。歷來美國締結商約，俱須經兩院討論，大費時日，于此非常時之美國，已不適用。且揆諸世界各國，簽訂商約不經議院過問者大有人在。其絶對無須議會審查者如坎拿大，英屬印度諸國。匈牙利祗須行文通知國會。英國取公布法，以二十八日爲限，過期諸議員不得有異議。他如法西斯統治下之意德，共産主義獨裁之俄國更無　論矣。然此與美國聯邦法律，殊稍有牴觸，第以諸國大勢所趨，故終獲得通過。惟總統行使此權限以三年爲期，商約有效期間，亦不得超過三年。　　（二）自由改訂税則，以百分之五十爲限（無論輸入方面抑輸出方面）。　但此僅係原則上之規定，另有　項特殊辦法（即左列（三）（四）兩項，其意義更爲重大。　　（三）對於美國國内不生産而以爲人民所必需者，需行免税，惟以與本國特種商品免税爲交換條件。如日本之生絲，法國之香檳酒白蘭地酒，巴西之咖啡，印度之茶，爪哇之橡皮等。苟日本願以美國棉花輸入免税爲條件，美國亦可豁免日本生絲之進口税。苟免爪哇橡皮之税，應取得機械進口免税爲交換……餘可類推。他如手製花邊，絲織品，皮貨、東方地毯、（中國），棕樹油（意）　，樟腦（日），鑑，乾　（俄），杏仁（西班牙），珠類（捷克）向日葵子油）荷），聖誕　裝飾品（德）……等商品，因美國内所産甚鮮或竟至不産者，亦予以最低之税率或免税。　　（四）對於與本國商品有競爭　　，得盡　增税，或甚　禁止輸入。烟草製品，棉子，火磚，汽車及配件，撥關車，安全剃刀，皮革，機械類，鋅　·鋼鐵，棉布，顔料，牲畜，洋灰，花岡石，鉛片類，電池，麵粉，罐頭類等…俱屬于此類。　　以上四端，係其皎面要者，餘請讀者自行參閲。（註七）　　五　結論　　據赫爾氏之論調，新關税法確係　界貿易之復興手段，然細就其實施方法觀之，則吾人知其政策，與昔并無何種不同之點。就第一項而言，前比美國已與四十八國訂有最惠國條約，本法案之效力，充其量亦不過將此等最惠國條約以另一形式再表現之而已。　　抑又有進者，此法案擬將國内不生産或産量稀少者則予减税或免税，對與國内商品有競爭性者，則重征之或竟禁止輸入。此種辦法，與保護關税之原理殊相吻合。然職是之故，赫爾氏所提之「路綫」，必不能達到。蓋新關税法仍不脱舊日關税之窠臼，結果仍發生一經濟的厮殺」也。荷里關税頒行之時，政府亦云以發辰國内産業，保護勞働者爲依歸，然結果適足以使國際貿易戰日趨激化，國内産業恐慌，失業者日增。赫爾關税，在理論上難以發展國際貿易，振興美國外貿爲主旨，惟結果能否達此目的，殊屬疑問。且際此經濟恐慌深刻化之局面，世界貿易之振興，并非「國際調協」所能解决，問題之中心，厥惟購買力之變動。苟旣喪失購買力者不能再獲得購買力，而購買力極萎小者不能擴　其購買力，則世界貿易，終無復興之望。　　　日本法案　帶規定，總統無權撤銷或核减戰債，蓋恐債務國或將干討論互惠商約時要求此方面讓步，所以防患于未然。關於此點，又充分表現本法案之矛盾性。如上段所述，購買力爲貿易問題之焦點，申言之，他國或需美國貨物，然彼輩缺乏金錢，彼輩（債務諸國）償債能力尙不足，常作「賴債」之嘗試，豈有餘金，以購美貨？苟美國慷慨對戰債問題讓步，斯他國購買力可抬高，世界貿易自有起色。然　築在個人主義上之資本主義國家，决無若是慷慨之風也。　　總之，赫爾關税，如其他藍舊運動下之設施然，僅從治標方面着想，而不謀治本之道。如對于股票恐慌，不謀解除各企業間之矛盾，而行交易所之統制。又其處理白銀問題，徒知收買白銀，提高銀價，殊不知用銀國購買力　不隨之提高。今次之赫爾關税政策，亦類乎彼。表面上則云「互惠」，「國際調恊」，誠冠冕堂持之至；實則與白銀政策，異途而同歸，將有所不利于人。赫爾關税實施後，世界諸國果能實行關税休戰，而締結多邊互惠商約乎？抑今後諸國更澈底其經濟的厮殺乎？事實最爲雄辯，吾人拭目以待之可也。－七月十八日于國立商學院　　（註一）Amer　can　Esporter,May　1934　Page　　　　　（註二）　Maysill　S,Stewarn　"Tarifi　Bargaining　undr　the　New　Dael　"　ForeingnPondy　Report　May　23,1934　　（註三）Commerce　Reports　（U.S.Departinent　of　Commercc），Fdb.17,1934　　（註四）American　Exporter,Fdb,1934　　（註五）Abert　Shaw:　Change　of　Tariii　Policy,"　Review　of　Review,May,19３４　　（註六）George　E.Sokoldy:"The　Hull　Tariff",New　Ouilook,May,1934　　（註七）Commeroial　anf　Financial　Chronicle　28　May　1934商業新聞金融　銀洋市靜定無變化　　昨星期銀行例假、故收解均停、錢業方面雖略有出入、乃因銀行休業、故爲數亦微、拆票交易、早市轉賬及新交易　百八十餘萬、午市交易十餘萬、小總會中交易二十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解二千七百餘萬、各路匯欵二十餘萬、洋拆市價早午亦仍開六分、與前日同、　輔幣方面　亦僅早市略有市面、下午因未做開、故完全相同、計江南小洋早市做八百三十四元五角、較前日略小一元、午市同、做出交易早市三千角、午市無、廣東小洋早市開七百二十七元五角、較前日略形改好五角、午市亦同、做出交易早市四萬五千角、午市一萬五千角、銅元則早午同爲三百三十千文、較前日又改小　千文、交易代價洋七千八百元、合數額　萬五千七百四十串文、（早午兩市價同）洋拆　六分　銅元　三百卅千文江南　八百三十四元五角　衣牌　三千三百文廣東　七百二十七元五角　角坯　二百四十文拆兑　一千三百七十四角六貼水　九十文證劵一週間債市高强　　漲度自數角起至一元外爲止　　上週七月二十三日至二十八日、華商證劵交易所、爲七月份期貨交割之前後期、前因政潮起伏、黄郛氏又有倦勤説、　市氣稍　、繼以九六公債之不整理、業　明白宣佈、人心稍有顧慮、終以財部不允修改銀行儲蓄章程、而趨勢復　、蓋政潮已得調停而息、九六風潮、自起自滅、完全爲投機家之操縱、早在明眼人逆料之中、初無關全局债債券漲跌之宏旨、惟銀行儲蓄章程、財部未允修改、因各銀行之準備公債庫券等、勢必遵章繳存中央銀行封儲、以爲存欵人之保障、此後檯而籌碼、必將感覺不敷週轉、上週經過、週一因已逼近交割、而環境謡言混沌、多頭出籠及掉期市况恍惚、高低互見、週二爲七月份期貨最後一天市面、始稍有軋空、略漲元許、週三祗做八月份一個月、九六不整理消息公佈、跌落一元餘、其他各債劵、亦略受影響、祗好二三角而已、週三因九六空頭太多、抵補甚湧、反回好四角、餘亦好二三角、市况平穏、週五爲七月份期貨交割之期停市、週六因儲蓄章程未允修改、九月份期貨適亦上塲、進户驟湧、市價略漲數角至一元之譜、一週市價結果、計漲起數　至一元有零、成交總數、計共八千０九十七萬元、兹將其漲跌結果、列比較表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）種類　現期　最高　最低　較前週　成交數一八關　七月　三０·００　二九·九五　漲０·一０　七０又　八月　二九·三０　——　新開出　一一０又　九月　新開出　五０編遺　七月　四四·三０四三七五　漲０·一五　七、０００又　八月　四四·四五　三·五０　又０·九０　一三、九０又　九月　新開出　一、七五０裁兵　七月　八０·一０　七九·一０　跌０·一０　一二、三五０又　八月　七九·二五　七八·六０　漲一·二０　三五、三五０又　九月　新開出　五、０五一九關　七月　一六·五五　四六·二五　漲０·二０　六、九五０又　八月　四六·五五　四五·四五　又一·二０　一七、五五０又　九月　新開出　一、九００一九善　七月　五二·八０　五二·００　漲０·六０　五、三００又　八月　五二·二０　五一·三五　又０·九五　七、五五０又　九月　新開出　二、一００廿捲　七月　五七·一０　五六·五０　漲０·二五　五、九五０又　八月　五七·三０　五六·０五　又一·三五　二０、三五０又　九月　新開出　二、八五０廿關　七月　五七·八０　五七·０五　漲０·二五　一０、四００又　八月　五八·一０　五六·六０　又一·四０　四、九五０又　九月　新開出　三、八五０廿統　七月　六０·七０　六０·一五　漲０·三　一五、二五０又　八月　六一·四０　五九·八０　又一·００　五二、九五０又　九月　新開出　八、五五０正鹽　七月　六二·四五　六一·九０　漲０·二五　二五、六五０又　八月　六二·七０　六一·二０为　又一·０五　六五、七五０又　九月　新開出　九、八００金短　七月　七六·一五　七五·六０　　漲０·０五　二七、七五０又八月　七八·０五　七六·六０　又０·九五　三七、三五０又　九月　新開出　八、九００賑災　七月　七六·六０　七三·八０　跌二·七０　五０又　八月　七六·四０　　七六·００　新開出　六五０二二關　七月　六八·四０　六七·四五　漲０·三０　一九二五０又　八月　八月　六八·六五　六七·二五　又○·八○　四八、八○○又　九月　新開出　四、五○○二三關　七月　七六·九○　七六·○　漲○·五　二、二五○又　八月　七六·九　七五·一○　又○·一○　一○、二五○又　九月　新開出　一、三五○整六　七月　七一·九○　七一·○○　漲○·三○　一四、　六五○又　八月　七二·六五　七一·四○　又○·八五　三五、四○○又　九月　新開出　一、七○○九六　七月　一三·五五　一一·五○　跌○·三　二八、一五○九六　八月　一三·六五　二·三○　又○·二○　一六一、二○○又　九月　新開出　一六、二五○金長　七月　五二·七○　五二·四○　跌○·　○　三○又　八月　五三·八○　五二·八○　漲○·五○　一五○奥政潮漸轉和緩紐約股票繼續回好　　昨（二十八日）紐約股市交易呆滯、但因奥國消息較前良好、旱狀减退、再以政府行　擴展航空、故價格升起數角至二元、全日成交四十七萬股、又據本行紐約代理人報告、（證券）市氣堅定、至收盤前交易　因週末關係袖手旁觀、乃略鬆弛、（小麥）下週天氣預測雨量極少、溫度與通常等或較高、加拿大有熱浪侵襲、價當上升、然此時適舉收成時期、多方籌碼充足、故麥價尙難大漲、　當利用跌價機會從事購進、下週私人之小麥報告將使價格升高、（棉花）近來合克薩斯州雖日有陣雨、但據私人報告、雨量仍嫌不中、農民對酷熱與作物枯黄、訴苦不絶、致市况在八月八日政府發表報告前游移而不定、棉花專家茂來氏已首先發表收成之估計、據其推算當在九百萬至九百五十萬包之間、又一氣候預測云、夜間台克薩斯州東部與麗亞格郎流域當有陣雨、兹將道瓊斯紐約指數列左、　　七月二十七日　二十八日　　上落三十種實業股　八七·七四　八八·七二　漲○·九八二十種鐵道股　三四·九九　三五·四七　漲·四八二十種公用股　一九·五八　一九·八六　漲○·二八四十種債券　九三·五九　九三·六三　漲○·○四紗花　美棉西部預測不佳　　昨日美棉初因投機家寳出而疲、後因西部預測不佳及華爾街買進、市况回堅、結果現貨漲五磅音、期貨漲五至九鎊音、英棉期貨漲五點、印棉初因歐洲出口商買進而堅、後因多頭獲利了結而軟　結果平果爾漲二羅比、奥姆辣漲三羅比半、白羅溪漲二羅比七角半、原電録左、二十八日電　　美棉　　　上日合國　英　　　　日合國幣　　　　三·六三漲·七　四二·五○　七　六八七漲五　四七·四○十二　一三·○四　六　四二·九○　八　八二　五　七·○○一　一三·○八　五　一三·○○　九　六八○　五　四六·九○三　一三·二二　八　一三·四○　十　六七八　五　四六·八○五　一三·二九　八　一三·七○　十一六七四　五　四六·四○七　三·三五　九　一三·八○現　一二　○○　五　四二·八○平加爾　一四五·二四漲　一·○○　二三·一○奥姆辣　一九八·○○　二·五○　三一·五○白羅溪　二一六·二五　二·七五　五四·三○上海各棧存棉統計　　－七月二十七日調查－花名　本届　比上届陜西花　二九、六○五件　减　一、一九八件靈寳花　一二、八七○件　七○○件美國花　四七·七七九件　增　二八五件捲筒花　六、八二九件　增　二、三四六件印度花　三九、五二七件　增　一四、二三八件埃及花　一、○四五件　减　二九○件天津花　一、五九八件　减　七四八件下沙花　二五四件　减　一二○件通州花　一五、七三六包　减　二、三四　包火機花　一○、○○○包　增　一、○○○包木架花　九一○件　太倉花　一、一五四包餘姚花　五七○包　　减　五九○包紗交倉庫存紗日增　　本市紗布交易所、倉庫中存紗量至七月二十八日共計三萬四千五百九十五包、内中二十支人鐘富貴兩牌占多數、邇來現紗銷路雖好、但縹紗市價未能趨升、而受倉庫中存紗太巨之壓迫也、兹將存紗之牌名及包額列下、（單位包）支别　紗名　包額　支别　紗名　包額二十支　人鐘　一七、七九五　二十支　球鶴　六○○二十支　富貴　六、八六○　二十支　天官　二五○二十支　金城　三、四五○　二十支　金鷄　一五○二十支　雙鹿　二、○五○　二十支　五福　二○○二十支　寳彞　一、五○○　二十支　牧羊　五○二地下支　採花　八二○　二十支　雙馬　一○○二十支　醒獅　六八○　十六支　富貴　九○南北貨　海口枝開出八百箱　　第四批新海口枝千餘箱、前日因談價不合、未成、昨重行議盤、號行雙方意見漸趨接近、當即開出八百箱之譜、計高水東枝開二十四元至二十三元半、正式揀莊枝十八元、其次略减、海口枝十一二元、比之前盤降去一元許、糖市　興化糖開出一批　　昨糖市無甚變動、趨勢平定、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨呌原價未成、其餘如荷赤太古糖以及本廠綿白均之乏上落、潮青僅開出高黄崗青數十包、價爲十三元四角、興化糖開出三四百包、計興化白十七元八角至六角、又次白十五元二角、興化赤特别高貨十四元三角、普通十三元八角至五角、興化青色采尙佳、惟身份甚軟、故難得價、開十二元二角、糧食　來源稀落河米再漲　　－浦東新粳續到百餘石－　　（滬南）各帮來源更稀、祗近十號、（貨共千四五百石）市况續見緊色、常帮蘇同南港等粳鮮特之貨俱見續增二三角、而其中市者及青角松泗西練等晚稻價、亦升一二角、惟近午本街去路猶現呆木、故雖當時有濟南帮包胃動納一百五六十包、而市態終覺不若朝市、社洋尖及陰變元因銷化尙佳、故價相隨步高角許、角餘不等、浦東新粳出新已見較湧、計南北市共到有百餘石、而銷塲猶能相仿、價續開十二元、　　常帮鮮市一二·二○黎平白粳一○·八○重固特特一二·○○又普通粳一一·七○又　特粳一一·一○西塘宿晚　九·九五又　變元二·八○又黄蘆尖　九·一○又　特别一○·九○同里白粳一一·一○新塍變元一一·一○練塘晚宿　九·七○又　清粳一一·五○平湖特粳一○·五○楓涇特别一○·九○又蘆洋尖一○·一○又　蘆尖一○·○○松江晚稻一○·九○吳口特粳一一·五○張堰早稻一○·八○　又特别一一·二五又　羊尖一○·二○加善羊尖　九·五○又　特包一一·八三北坼白粳一一·二○青角特包一一·二五航船晚稻一二·○○又　羊尖一○·一○又　另特一一·五○黄橋晚稻一一·一七周莊白粳一○·四○泗涇特包一一·三八張澤晚稻一一·二○（滬北）浦東新粳已見五石五斗、米品因天旱比去年略

<p>冰箱是必需的家用冷藏庫，可見在彼邦，已是家喻户曉，女運動家耳濡目染，且把管理冰箱認做主婦十項運動之一的了。　　可是在我國，没有冰廠或水電廠的地方，冰箱的使用，也根本談不到。就是在生活比較暢遂的都會，除却館子的設置冰箱，確實是用做食物防腐的利器以外，小康家庭夏令的購置冰箱，他的用法和目的，大都只在用來「冰凍」——冷却——食品（並且大都只是飲料和果品）的，無怪一般人都把它看做滿足口腹之慾的舒適品，不當它是衛生上的必需品，並且把代價極昻，防腐力尤其穏妥可靠的電力冰箱（用電力自動出水結冰，自動開關）敬而遠之，看做奢侈品啦。　　用冰箱做冰凍食品的工具，致冷的程度原來没有一定，管理上稍微馬虎一點，自然全不打緊。但是果眞要靠它防腐，那可須得注意到那迪女士所説的注意冰箱一項「運動」了。關於這層，且待咱提供衛生家所指摘的幾點，寫述在下面，給閲者參考一番：　　（一）冰箱裏的溫度不可超過攝氏七度，因爲細菌在攝氏七度，還能够發育，腸炎桿菌（糞傳病病菌代表）在攝氏十度，也就能發育。尋常冰箱多因存冰不足，或是構造不良，超過攝氏七度（平均在攝氏十五度以上）；把食物藏在裏面，無異把培養基放在孵箱裏，培養細菌，實在不妥。　　（二）冰箱每多放在竃旁。或日光所能射到的塲所。它的門又常不緊閉。因此耗費極多，並不能收完善的冰藏功效。　　作者如此推重冰箱，認它做家用必需品，决不是在給冰箱店做廣告！又提倡用冰箱給食物防腐——給食物保持鮮潔，並不是鼓勵人家吃宿食。用了冰箱做防腐器，暫時貯存冰箱的食物，無論生熟，當然仍以現購，現煮，當日「報銷」掉它——無疑地是造糞報銷——爲是。疾病常識問答  程翰章　　（三十四）消化不良症　　Ｄyspepsia　　（問）什麽呌做消化不良症？　　（答）消化不良症，就是因爲消化器的化學機能異常和腸内細菌的狀况變化而起的消化障碍。　　（問）患這種病的時，消化器内有没有解剖上的變化？　　（答）消化器内没有什麽變化。　　（問）消化不良症，可分幾種？　　（答）可分發酵性的腐敗性消化不良症二種。　　（問）起發酵性消化不良症的發生理由是怎樣的？　　（答）因爲多含糖類（炭水化合物）而容易發酵的食品，在消化器的上部不被吸收而達盲腸，在這裏面逢着細菌的分解，起發酵異常而致消化障碍。　　（問）原因怎樣？　　（答）就因爲吃多量的甜食，米粉食，腸蠕動加速，發酵菌向上行到高位的小腸中面作用的時候；或對於炭水化合物（糖食粉食之類）有特異感受性的人，或在夏季多吃生水菓，腐敗的啤酒，發酵的葡萄汁等的時候，都能起這種發酵性消化不良症。　　（問）發酵性消化不良症的症狀怎樣？　　（答）急性症的時候，起惡心，腹痛，腹内騷鳴，腹部起强度的膨漏感，排出數回有刺戟臭的稀薄淡黄色的糞便。在輕症的時候，有腹中不快的感覺，洩屁等；但没有泄瀉。　　（問）這種病容易反復再發的嗎？　　（答）施行治療之後，數天的症狀就消退；但是有再發的傾向，並且容易食傷。所以在長期間中，有時排出正常的大便，有時又排出發酵性的大便了。　　（問）食慾和營養狀態怎樣？　　（答）食慾大都佳良，而營養狀態也不錯。　　（問）腸黏膜受了分解産物的刺戟後，起什麽症狀？　　（答）這時候便要變成發炎症狀，全身發熱，大便中混黏液。　　（問）腐敗性消化水良症的發生理由是怎樣的？　　（答）因爲吃了適量的蛋白質，或胃酸缺乏，致食物中蛋白不能充分消化，到腸内後起腐敗分解之故；或腸液分泌多量，以致腐敗菌繁殖，或因腸内容停滯等而起。　　（問）這種消化不良症的症狀怎樣？　　（答）也像發酵性消化不良那樣，腹内起不安，洩屁，騷鳴，泄瀉便等。但並没有腸痛。大便，呈暗褐色，鹼性，稀薄或如粥狀。含有多量的組織殘渣，泄瀉，每日早晨發一次，或有和便秘交替而來的。但食物中的脂肪，仍能吸收，所以皮下脂肪並不覺得减瘦。　　（問）這種消化不良症，也有再發的可能嗎？　　（答）病狀經過二三天到二三星期，消失之後，大都有再發的可能。往往連續數年漸起營養障碍，而成貧血性。　　（問）消化不良症的療法怎樣？　　（答）一方面應該注意食物，凡發酵性消化不良症，給與缺乏炭水化物的食品（就是忌糖類澱粉米食等）。腐敗性消化不良症與以缺乏蛋白質的食品。（就是忌肉類蛋白等）　並且限制菜蔬，香辛、咖啡等品。一方面服藥，用腸内消毒劑以防止腐敗發酵，像雷鎖辛（Rlsoran）薩羅（Salol）之類。同時兼用，制瀉藥像鉍劑鞣酸劑，炭末，鴉片之類。另一方面則用微溫皂水洗腸。耳鼻喉眼衛生常識（續）  唐仁縉　　三，繁華的城市（像上海）。到了夏天。總有露天跳舞塲，露天電影塲，哥　而夫球塲，夜花園等類的開放。來供消遣悮樂。到這些地方的摩登小姐。大都只穿輕紗薄綢的衣服。深夜歸家的時候。常常不愼受寒而傷風。　　四，夏天的氣溫高。冬天的氣溫低。在氣溫高的時候。因水分排泄量過多（汗液分泌旺盛的緣故。）所以大都好飲清凉水汁（如冰汽水，冰橘水等。）和好食冰凍物品（如冰西瓜，冰忌淋，刨冰等。）此時若過食其量。或勉强，（不慣）飲食。則鼻腔粘膜往往能引起反射變化而傷風。　　諸位讀了上面講的四條事實。當可知道傷風的來源及鼻腔粘膜同氣溫變化的關係了。　　鼻腔或咽腔，如果本來患有病變。像（一）鼻中隔彎曲不正，（二）副鼻腔疾病，（三腺樣增殖症（咽頭扁桃腺，）（四）口蓋扁桃腺肥大症等。倘若遇到上面講的感染傷風的機會。那就更容易傷風了。前面講的種種傷風原因。都是特發性的鼻膜發炎。還有一種症候的鼻膜發炎。是指在一種急性傳染病經過中也會發生傷風而言。像麻疹（痧子），流行性感冒（重傷風），腸梯扶斯（傷寒）等的經過中。是最易遇得着的。這裏我暫不詳細講下去。因爲本屬於本題的範圍啊。　　講到傷風的病情。是很容易知道的。他普通總是侵犯兩側鼻腔。發病前常常感覺不舒服，疲倦，頭重，頭眩，惡寒輕熱，等等。後來鼻腔内，就覺灼熱，和搔癢。時常噴嚔。前頭部發生疼痛。苦於鼻腔分泌旺盛及鼻腔閉塞。嗅覺有時亦受影響而减退或消失。病人談話時。常帶鼻音。鼻腔分泌物，在初期的時候。是稀薄木樣漿液性。後來變爲粘液膿性。最後變爲純粹濃厚膿性。此時若用鼻鏡檢查鼻腔，大都能見粘膜發赤腫脹。此等症狀大約經過三四天。卽可减輕，痊愈約須一週左右。但是傷風往往能誘起别種疾病。以致遷延時日。這是常見的事實。如炎症波及副鼻腔。則生副鼻腔炎（上顎竇炎最多人。如分泌物經過歐氏管。竄入中耳。則容易引起急性中耳炎。如炎症侵入氣管支。則生氣管支炎。關於這種病的起源和病情。日後當再詳述。現在暫停不談了。　　講到傷風的治療方法。是很簡單的。普通分預防法，發汗法，和局部療法。這三個方法當中。最緊要而自已可以實行的。就是預防法。像氣溫的變化，器械的刺戟，化學的刺戟，塵埃的侵入，精神的影響等。都是應當注意的。至於發汗法和局部療法。則非在醫師診察指導下。不可自已濫用的。所以我不敢妄行介紹藥石和方法的緣故。也就爲此啊。不過我有幾件有益的事體。是要奉勸傷風病家實行的。就是（一）整理大便。勿使秘結。（二）避免辛辣及油膩飲食。（三）多飲開水或熱的檸檬汗（補助發汗法）（四）汗水洗足。（五）最好靜臥休息。（六）居室空氣要新鮮清潔。肺結核淺説（十四）  胡嘉言　　根據上面的叙述，結核病在病理解剖上的一般變化，係可以分作三個時期的；第一是結核，第二是乾酪變性，第三是空洞。但我們祗可以説：病灶完備的變化是如此的；並不是這三個階級，是必須經過的。譬如在乾酪變性的時期，如果現石灰性硬化了，那當然不會發生空洞的；就是結核也不是個個呈乾酪變性的。這一種病灶的停止變化，完全是周圍發生結締組織的緣故。那末，我們不妨下一個斷語，就是：如果病變進行緩慢，而結締組織增生很速的，是一個良好的特徵；一切的結核病，完全是經過這樣的事實而轉愈的。　　結核病在病里解剖上一般的情形，上面已經叙述過了；那末，他在肺臓局部，是怎樣的情形呢？這是包括在病理解剖學各論範圍以内的。他的最初病灶，比較係肺上葉部分頂多，並且是密集在胸膜下面的。他的大小，像一顆大麻粒似的，有時可大到像一顆櫻桃似的。這種最初病灶，尋常祗有一個，狠少有二個三個的。他的性質，和乾酪性氣管枝肺炎相彷彿，周圍是給結核性肉芽組織包覆的。這種情形，在幾個星期或幾個月光景，係可自愈的。但是他和淋巴道是很接近的，結核菌可由此而蔓延的，結果也會構成肺門腺體結核和淋巴管炎的。這一層事實經過，最初病灶淋巴管炎和肺門體結核併合起來，醫學上給他一特殊名詞，呌做：初期集合，這就是蘭克氏所指的和线期肺結核病了。　　肺結核的蔓延，是不僅限於淋巴管系統，他可以向血管系統方面移轉，結果會發生急性粟粒結核的，這一種情形，在前面肺結核之演進一章已經説過，此處只好從略了。　　肺結核症到了完成的時期，根據解剖上性質的不同，可以分出好幾個種類的；這方面最明顯的例子，就是上面所講過的增生性滲出性二種分别了。屬於增生性一方面的，有散在性粟粒結核，腺體小泡性肺結核，腺體小泡結節性肺結核，硬變性肺結核，四種的分類。屬於滲出性一方面的，有乾酪性肺炎和氣管枝肺炎性二種的分别，因爲他的病灶很多在腺體小胞的，結果又産生腺體小泡乾酷性肺炎的名稱。這每一種的情形，以及他們不同的地方，如果一一的叙述，那當然是太嫌專門了。在這幾種裏面，以散在性粟粒結核和乾酪性肺炎二種，比較是最重要，他的變化又係明明顯：在臨床上，又是單獨習見的，並且一個是代表增生性，一個是滲出性；那末，他們各自爲政的情形，當然可以單獨提出，一一的述其大概了。　　肺部裏面的結核的構成和變化，是和其他一切的器官，没有什麽區别的；他是在肺小泡的毛細管部分，氣管枝，和小動脈壁裏面産生的；此中最明顯的例子，就是散在性粟粒結核了。他在左右兩肺，都可以見着無數的粟粒大小，灰色至灰黄色的，小結節的。這種結節，幾乎是肺臓全部都平均分配着的。他的所在，也係以肺小泡的毛毛細管部分，和小動脈壁發生爲多的。他的發生緣由，上面已經説過，係血管系統被侵襲之所致；所以這種粟粒的結節，在肺部以外的器官，也會發現的。結果他的外表症象，也發生全身嚴重狀態的；這就是本病在臨床上被劃入急性傳染病的一部分裏面之所自了。談醫（續）  計濟霖　　現代醫學，誠幼稚矣，然如以我國之舊醫與由西洋傳入之新醫相比較，則舊醫者幼稚更有甚焉。蓋舊醫之學，不求實騐，徒憑理想，故百説紛紜，莫衷一是，其間復受佛老玄學之影響，竟以捕風捉影之陰陽五行謬説，解釋人體各種之變化，以定治病之方針，致令神農氏親嘗百草，求醫學於實騐中之精神，淪没無遺，故嚴格言之，今日之舊醫學，實不若原始時代之有價值也，新醫則不然，其學説，根於學理，證之實騐，設實騐之結果與學理不符者，則其説不能成立，不自欺欺人，他勿具論，卽以人體解剖言之，其部位之精確，説理之詳明，豈舊醫之左肝右肺等徒憑理想，不符實在之謬説，所可同日語耶？其他如生理學，病理學，微菌學，藥物學等等，新醫莫不由實騐而得，不但一人實騐如是，且經千萬人實騐皆同，如顯微鏡下之各種微菌，一經寓目，雖千萬人亦何由異其辭焉，今日舊醫固嘗視五行六氣之學，爲金科玉律，而不信某種疾病，由於微菌傳染而起，此何足怪。蓋學術進步，有一定之程序，新醫在百餘年前，思想之幼稚，固與今日舊醫等耳，當一八八三年之際，歐洲科學，已在萌芽時代，醫學亦由玄想的而入於實騐的階梯，但微菌學鼻祖科和氏在病人糞便及腸壁中發現之霍亂菌，猶未能取信於衛生學大家斐敦壳甫氏，蓋斐氏認霍亂病之發生，由於水土之關係，迨試服曾經培養之霍亂菌，而生霍亂病，幾至不救，方信科和氏之説爲不謬，其以身試病之行爲，雖不足法，而爲學理而犧牲之精神，及使後人對於微菌學説，增其信仰，斐氏之功，亦有足録。我國舊醫有如斐氏親身試騐之精神者乎？如有之，則於新醫實騐所得之微菌學説，將瞠目咋舌不敢反對矣，故舊醫之學，僅能迷惑今日缺乏醫學知識之人民，如欲與新醫爭一日之長，至少須待百年之後也。　　總之，世界萬物，未能吾人所知者，爲數不少，科學至今日雖稱發達，然僅啟其端而已，醫爲科學之一，自亦不能例外，吾人擇醫，務須擇其現代化者，於願已足，如求人盡不死，病皆可醫，則現代醫學，尙未能臻此境也。（完）短訊　　入夏以來。天氣酷熱。各項皮膚病。如癤腫，癰疽，疽，痱子，癬，皮炎，等。因之猖獗。此項皮膚病。初起時雖似小病。然若

<p>自由談赤道的黄昏  斐兒　　我説，最美麗的是赤道上的黄昏。　　試想：黑魃魃烏壓壓的椰林轟立在熱帶的巷道兩旁，黄昏的赤道的微風吹着秋天的氣息。天上浮着飄渺的淡薄的白雲，西方掛着赤紅的落日的雲彩。遠處，黑叢叢的大塊的暗影佈滿在空間；在身邊，「阿答」厝前的黑色的小孩赤裸着身軀頑跳。在這廣闊的荒野，大地從一日的炎熱的壓迫里呼出神秘的氣息，淡漠的空間響着一種無聲的從赤土底下吐出來的嘆息。夜的黑影從椰叢底下慢慢爬起，天上却漸漸地閃出了星星。在這時，馬來人挨着你的身邊而過，打着微笑的招呼；一種超乎人間的歡愛，泛濫在心田，幾令人疑是處在一個理想的世界，或是一個幻想的境界。……　　更可愛的是駕着一葉馬來小舟，泛諸江河的中流。乘着潮水，小舟會像箭般隨着水流疾馳奔去。兩岸是，原野的森林築起黑色的圍牆，黄昏的夕照在樹梢上泛上一片灰黄的色澤。在河里，鱺魚在水中浮沉，一段木頭會在旋渦里打着滾轉，。歸鳥成羣地在野林上喧噪，在滾滾的河流上空間疾飛而去。在河的轉角，水流在夕霞映照中打着急轉。小舟激着水流，摇擺欲沈，却是衝水而過；船底下響出低微而玄少的音調。遠方的天上，由深紅變成淡紫，却轉而成灰黑。在空闊的茫茫的森林兩岸，濃黑的樹叢間偶或閃出星星小火；廣闊的河道上却浮上漁舟三數，漁火欲滅復明。空氣中傳來馬來青年的情歌，歌声顫動欲絶；羊皮鼓播出迷人的原始的音調，在河道的激流中間激出微茫的急喘。夜色漸漸地在河上籠罩，大河中流迫成一道光亮的白帶，椰殻和樹頭夾在潮流里浮泛。河流在兩岸旁邊罩上了濃厚的暗影，潮水的反流在河床邊濺出了淙淙之聲。　　或者去住在一間「阿答　厝里，孤立於森林叢中。讓矮竹或紅花圍成籬笆，「阿答」厝前的曠地上吹來香花的芬芳陣陣。看黄昏像臨近來的灰色的巨人，森林的野道風傳來近處回敎徒的唸經細咒。室里一盞椰油燈，看起來有如鬼火；漆綠的欄杆邊上映着鮮明的夕照，自然在人間繪成畫圖。遠處一把自然火，在黄昏里野林的燃燒有如施放的烟花。樹林里歸鳥啁啾，野禽鳴呌；野獸在遠處怒吼，蛇從屋前緩緩爬過。風在樹梢上吹拂，簌簌之聲如見樹影摇動；一彎新月初露臉於黄色的檳榔花間，香氣可得而聞。　　這是什麽種的世界？什麽種的人間？一個人生活於這種時候，他的心靈會發生什麽變化？會發生什麽反響？譬如是一個具有微妙的性靈之感者吧，他的心境會成爲什麽種形態？又譬如是一個藝術家吧，他會因以傾瀉出什麽筆調和獲得什麽一種搔抓人心深處的力量？　　我不知道我將怎樣爲赤道的黄昏禮讚，我感覺到我的力量是怎麽地低微。在茫茫的赤道大地底下，人是顯得怎樣地渺小。在那神秘性的，詩意的，和具有哲學意味的大自然的藝術構圖里，我是渺小和空虚得有如赤道里的風，或天上的淡漠的雲。唯一的感覺只是：我愛赤道上的黄昏；我説那是世界上最美麗的景色。第二人稱  天　　約二十年前，内地某敎會學校，某次請了一個美國人演講。登臺第一句話是Boyx　!全體學生聞之，勃然大怒：——這不是在説我们是小孩嗎？立刻紛紛退去，後來鬧了一次風潮。　　好像那時的學生還有些頑固的餘風，對於外來的侮辱，半點不能承受。頑固而頗自尊，尊嚴中也包含着誇大。——不過這一次的確頗有些誤會了，boys并非有意輕蔑之詞，不過是一種直接的稱謂而已。　　依照敝國文字的使用法，直接稱呼是少有的，用人對於主子稱「大人」，「老爺」，「長」，「主任」，「少爺」，「小姐」，「太太」，……依西洋文法看，是他或他，列入第三人稱，或但舉官銜，或直表親誼，（大概皆那麽熱刺刺地，有時不免使被呼者耳紅。）或竟没有主詞，只可以意會，而有時竟不能達意，只得呌「某孩的父親」之類，更是繞一大彎子。　　一到直稱「你們」，便有些引車賣漿者流的氣味了。敎師拍案怒咕，開除「你們」！或軍官呼士兵，包「你們」升長！事實上這皆有從上至下的涵義。推而廣之，并主詞也不稱，可以作第二人稱，也可以作第三人解，可以説是多數，也可以説少數，施用起來，便更艱難：而對於在冷角或街頭駡人，使聞之者生戒心，言之者更無責任了。（如果有主詞，他是非掉頭不可的。）這是中國文字活動的好處。　　據説在印度日耳曼語中，往往不止一個「你」字，有一個表示親愛，有一個表示尊敬，更有多數少數的不同，十六變化，各種文法，一絲不亂。這何嘗能在敝國進行。最近好像有人也頗喜歡直接稱呼了，却碰到「人間世」中個啟事：「用告狀式對幽魂對蠟燭對青天對白雲用「你」稱呼者不取。」是指寫詩。——這就無從説起！旱  李輝英　　天晚了。　　一連刮了幾陣凉風，吹冷了日間酷熱的空氣。　　地面上的熱氣尙未退盡，無精打彩地王阿興在田間小路上走着，預備回家去吃晚飯。已經是半百以上的老人，爲了生活，還是不能在家裏靜養，休息着，而他走每天天不亮就肩着耙子或是鋤頭下田的；土地就是他的寳貝。他有着中等身材，但因爲連年過度的勢動，上身有些彎向前去，後背上自自然然地就露出個小駝背來。皺紋掛滿他的臉上，嘴巴下的鬍子，大概是無暇整理的原故，亂茸茸地散成了一團。身上的短褲褂，汗水染出一片一片的痕跡，有如布料上原來製成的不規則的花紋。　　兒子緊跟在他的身後，是一個膀大身寛非常健壯的年青漢子，赤着的上半身和捲起褲褪露在外面的下腿、皮膚的顔色和面色一樣，是紅中透紫的，另外還伏有一層光光的油漬。　　路上的小草，萎伏着身腰，天氣熱得他們連抬頭呼吸一口大氣的餘裕都没有　　一天的時光又過去了，還是没有落下一滴雨水，即或連一片浮雲都很難在天空上尋求得到。但人們是何等的需要雨水呀！已經有半個多月没有下雨了，照這樣再旱下去那還了得！　　王阿興父子兩個此時有着滿腹的愁惱，也是爲了雨，幾聲長嘆正表白出他們難言的苦衷。　　一邊走着，王阿興一邊注視着西天的紅霞，爲什麽不是雨雲呢？明天，看這情形怕又不是落雨天。河浜裏的水，漸漸减少，人們用水反倒加多，説不定再過幾天只乘出乾涸的河身。　　「眞怪，這樣旱！」　　低語着，但是已經讓兒子聽見了，隨便附合上一句：　　「誰道這是怎回事！」　　説完話，呆呆地把身旁田地看了一遍；所有的田禾，都被上黄尖黄棄，眼看要枯死了。他剛藉着田苗本身説句什麽話，不料爹爹先他開了口：　　「要快點走呀，吃完飯還要車水呢。」捧（續）  溫谷　　捧的關係的維持，就在人人要想往上爬，但越是上層所能載住的人越少，因此捧人也免不了要競爭，會捧的勝利的才能躍到上層，失敗的會從上層擠落下來，或簡直被人一脚踢開。捧着人自已跟着被捧者往上爬，固然可以拿許多人未塾脚，但頭頂上還不免有人家的脚踏着，究竟不如身居塔尖只把人家來墊在脚下來得痛快舒服，所以人人都希望能做一座寳塔的塔尖。　　但是塔尖兒也有他的危險：　　（一）塔尖雖　萬人之上，如果脚底下的幾個人，感到那踏在自已頭頂上的脚討厭時，把頭一摇，也就得從雲端裏掉下來。　　（二）捧人也要競爭，大家都爭要直接捧塔尖，使自已的地位僅次於塔尖。當他們烈熱地競爭，互相排擠傾軋的時候，站在他們頭上的塔尖的安全却會被忘記的。　　（三）捧人的希望跟着被捧的往上爬，所以拚命的捧，惟恐被捧者不高，被捧在塔尖上的，雖已感覺自已高入險境，也身不由主，只有聽人捧着，到得頭昏眼花的時候，説不定會從塔尖上倒栽下來。　　（四）捧人的往往用種種技巧，如幻術般手段，捧得搭尖的人不亦樂乎，不覺乎之舞之，足之蹈之，一不留神，從塔尖失足掉下來，也就要粉身碎骨。　　（五）捧人的常喜把被捧的人奉爲天下唯一至尊無上者，被捧者被捧得「得意忘形」，不自覺地目空一切，把老虎作爲蚊蟲，直到老虎把他吃了，還不知天地間何來這兇的老虎！　　人世間一座一座的寳塔樹起來又，一座座地塌下去，一羣一羣的人往上爬，又一羣羣倒下來，就這樣完成了許多功業，也遺留下更多的罪孽。（完）田野間  徐訏　　就因爲繭價不好，去年春蠶都没有飽，所以今年桑葉雖然青翠，但是我們都没有養蠶。爲去年養猪的賠了本，於是鷄鴨跑遍了小村。還不知稻熟時榖價怎樣，也何敢空期田裏的禾秧。她們身上穿着藍布衫，手上是剪刀，胳膞上是籃，紅的花不　，但黄的花不採，她們只選那青草叢中的野菜。還有那十來歲的孩童，也都在田野間做工，他們的肚子雖早已餓，但他們還不想採野菓。三眠  ＴＫ我來自東（十）  星野　　碧海長天中的夏威夷　　幾天很大的風浪，把甲板上的客人，一個個的驅逐到艙裏去了。按時吃飯的人，當然不多。在吸烟室同娱樂室裏面的幾個人，也都蹙着眉頭，遇到時候，問一聲「你覺得怎樣？劉君已吐得不成樣子，半夜裏風浪大時，在我的高舖的下面狂呌。可憐的四川人，谁呌他不生長海濱，免得受這塲苦惱。太平洋這次眞有點不太平！茶房把室内的椅子，桌子，用銅鈎鈎在地板上，以免大浪來時，室内鬧得桌翻椅覆。大家都懷着鬼胎，大家都希望「太平洋的樂國」快點到來。　　昨天夜裏，在甲板上已發見飛鳥的影子。今天早上，我們在晨光下看見了飛魚。同船的菲列賓人，便大驚小怪的指給我看。我們已漸漸的靠近赤道，太陽照在背上，發生一種特殊的感覺·到艙裏換上了白色的衣服，再上甲板時，夏威夷的山影已漸漸的由綫狀變成魚狀。甲板上的人們，漸漸的多起來。許多人拿着望遠鏡，指手畫脚的談着。「極樂世界」近了。那些吐得皮黄骨瘦的船上的男女們，也眉開眼笑起來。夏威夷眞是樂國，她給海上的旅客的安慮，好像給久渴的嬰兒們以孔漿。　　這個長滿着甘蔗，波羅蜜，和椰子樹的島國，對於我乃是一個神秘的夢。在白色的沙灘上，海波帶着月浪，老是向着椰子陰深處發着清妙的潮歌。樹下時常有活潑的夏威夷女兒，悵望着没有盡頭的海洋，在懷念着她們的海上的情人。從地球面上各處駛來的船隻，聚集在這個小小的島國上。夏威夷的音樂隊，每當船隻啟椗的時候，便秦着很悲凉的　　　　　　用許多花環，掛在别離者的頸上，船開出港，大家把花環丢在水裏，紅色紫色的鮮花，便總滿船的背後，據説：如果花環，流出港口來，這個人便永不會再回到夏威夷了。這些一切泛這些富有趣味的一切，加上微酸的波羅蜜漿，和乳白色的椰子肉，使我覺得夏威夷眞是一個用極細的黄金絲縷織成的幻夢。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言懶怠哲學  毋奇　　懶怠本來是一種惡劣的品行，可是在我國却是成了一種道德。而且是有人在提倡推行的一種道德。　　懶怠這一種道德，如果要給大學生編一部懶怠學講義的話，第一章是謙讓，第二章是和平，第三章是多一事不如少一事，第四章是辦事馬馬虎虎，第五章是做一日和尙撞一日鐘得過且過，第六章是烟茶自娱莫管世事，第七章是榻横陳萬事俱休，…再加上一章中學爲體西學爲用的東西洋哲學混合論作結論便可以在大學裏混過了一年的專任敎授的課程。第一章謙讓，講的是自認是老大國民凡事以謙爲主以讓爲先，應該做的事舉凡文化學術政治等等，盡讓人家去研究擴充，咱們最好是不必費心研究而以逸待勞地坐享其成地應用人家的研究所得而作試騐，就是應用起來此路不通的話，其罪在别人不在自已，無妨試騐又試騐，横竪失敗是成功之母。在這一章裏可以引用許多例證，講起書來，至少有兩個月可以混過去，因爲這裏談到的問題，如文化學術，如政治，等等，範圍何等廣大。第二章和平，講的是王道的政治哲學，從攻擊人家的侵略戰爭的無道理非人道講起，引伸古今中外的歷史，闡發大偉人大政治家大哲學家的和平偉論，結到以仁義服人爲善以武力服人爲惡的大道理，在這一章裏如果要多講就無妨多講，要少講也至少講他十幾個鐘頭（如果是一星期上兩點鐘，也就有一兩個月了）。第三章多一事不如少一事，講的是佛老之學，無爲爲體，參禪爲用，革心爲上，佛老救國，從靜坐唸經的方法，講到修道成佛的秘訣，發揮於人無爭於生無慾的玄理。第四章辦事馬馬虎虎講的是，唯心史觀的人生哲學，從太極至於無極的玄學，講到地球與太陽系的關係，人類與宇宙的比較，講出人類的渺小，壽命的短促，人生如朝露，處世若大夢，凡事不必認眞，一切都該馬虎。第五章做一日和尙撞一日鐘得過且過，講的是秦始皇决定而未編行的公民學，引證不在其位不謀其政的古訓；又講儒家傳下的倫理學，引證安分守已遵古禮學古人的道德，在實踐上保守爲上進取次之，人生以鬼混爲不二法門。第六章烟茶自娱莫管世事，講的是，抽烟吃茶的專門學識，和閉門家中坐的修善功夫。第七章一榻横陳萬事俱休，講的是：保家的不二法門練氣的惟一方法，比較佛老的唸經坐禪，其入定的工夫還高出萬倍；謙讓和平與世無事，人格至爲高尙，雖刀槍在前水火臨身，心定無爲不被威脅誘惑，而對於世事萬念俱休。……結論是東西洋哲學混合論，人生問題玄之又玄，處世方法無爭無爲才是上策。！而自然，這講義不能够呌做懶怠學，而呌做人生哲學了。在理論上是人生哲學，在行爲上便是道德了。　　假如我所編的講義，全國大學應用作爲課本，我想懶怠這一種學識。培養出來的大學生，將來服務國家服務社會，當然比較光讀幾本名人所編的雜志以及到社會做事以後才領受到的學識，容易了解與實行的多多了家庭與社會  炳　　眞是夢也不曾夢想過，讀書的結果是這麽一種况味！　　不説在小學裏，中學裏，就當混進大學的當年，也還像安樂王子般的一無遠慮。家庭負擔兒子的求學費用，在現社會制度下，旣談不到社會「公育」「公敎」，那我想這是家庭應負的責任。澈透點説，是父兄對子弟應盡的義務。至於我呢，雖然讀過一輩子的書，却並未怎樣牽累過家庭。小學的一個階段，雖説是完全由家庭擔負，但一則族上有點津貼，一則費用眞是微小的很，算來家庭於我有過什麽優飫？　　當我在讀書的時期，眞夢也不曾夢想過，家庭原當我是一顆摇錢樹，一個聚寳盆，另一方面，在社會上，洒盡了血和汗也那麽艱苦的撈不到幾個錢，而撈到了手，却又那麽耗費得快，右手進，左手出，連兜進口袋去烘熱一下子都不可能。然而一到這時，家庭是不能略予原諒了，眞是迫害得人死。　　　我雖然視父兄之敎育子弟，是一種應盡的義務，却也並未遺忘「圖報的履行。」這幾年在社會上混，總是竭力撙節的去照應家庭，這我並没有什麽虚榮心，以冀博得鄉里人士的好評，而獲得什麽精神上的快感。家庭確是很苦的，外面的生活，雖説也是脱離不了一個「苦」字，但比較起來，也總還要「略勝半籌。」一個青年，本應熬煎一下子，纔知道人世的艱辛，光顧一己的揮霍，當然是不應該。　　然而事實的迫害，終使我喘不過氣來了！　　最近家庭不但不原諒我，而脸對我非常不滿，甚至是疾惡彌天了。他們的不顧事實的，理由是這樣：聽説我在外面單做文章都能撈多少錢，而又是個獨身漢，没有家眷的浩費，每月賺得的錢花到那兒去了呢？某某的兒子止不過在外當一個茶房，年終有幾百塊銀寄回去。而我是在外面當先生，幹好事，却反而抵不上一個僕人，説給誰聽都不會相信，當然是根本忘記了家庭的原故。　　這眞使我怔住了，我捧讀着這冒火的信箋，不由的一倒上床去，左思右想，想不出方法去和向他們解釋，不，方法是有的，事實也是有的，所苦的是怎樣也不能獲得他們的諒解與相信。　　然而我一想及那實際的慘狀，果然使人暈厥欲死！一個本來是尴尬不堪的家庭，接連的死了母親，祖母，又死去父親，田地就一再的拍賣得精光了。還有兩個妹子待嫁閨中。留在家裏的機個弟兄旣不爭氣，又無討令本領，年歲却是這麽大，天災人禍，無間歲月，柴米油鹽，繼漲增高，他們遭受着饑餓的驅使，致而埋怨飄泊異鄉的孤另，也許是情理所必至的吧。而况我確曾讀了一輩子書（雖然不曾求得高深學問）而現在又確實在外混幹着事。　　可是我又憑着良心説，我不曾一刻兒忘了家庭，我的生活更未染受一般的浪費病。實在是事實太委曲人了，奔波</p>

<p>在不景氣的都市裏的浪人怎能拯救得了落陷在破産的農村裏的家人呢？我又没有官運，又不能去作綁匪。　　這是多麽使人難堪的迫害啊！夏夜夢  容　　「夏夜夢」是個絶美的名詞，不知什麽人把莎士比亞的那本名劇譯成這個名字。現在夏天到了，在昏沉沉的天幕蔭蔽之下，借着幾點繁星的光芒，便加倍容易令人想起這三個美的字眼。在詩人的幻想中，夏夜應當有神秘的流螢，柔和如慈毋的微颸，新月所孕育的靜默，啣着一枝烟的安詳的談話，或竟至草木的摇曳，禽鳥的謳歌。可是處在這大都市裏，醜惡的街衢摧毁了詩人田園的夢想。所謂富於靈感的人，怕也只能撇開山林清趣不講，而摇着蒲扇穿着拖鞋在弄堂裏乘着風凉了罷？這該是多麽殺風景的事實！　　夏夜是美的，卽在都市裏也别具一種魅人的姿態，舞塲的清凉，黑暗中年紅燈的熠燿，公園中悠揚的樂曲，乃至從法國梧桐葉梢投下來的水樣燈光，都充滿了音樂與詩的微妙之美。都市的夏夜也有「夢」的，而且因了人工的巧飾，這「夢」更能迷人。然而這只有某一部分人的專利，囊空如洗的人，往往會在那舞塲門首，公園籬畔，市輪渡碼頭旁邊作着徘徊踟蹰，而感到一夜無名的悲哀。「夏夜夢」是要作的，而且這「夢」要做得美，没有美便不能引志靈感，而靈感的來源却是那最俗氣的「錢」，「夏夜夢」與「錢」看似不相融合，其實兩者有極密切的關係，用錢來買夏夜夢，這事够多滑稽？可是仔細想想會使你啼笑皆非的　　處在侷狹的小室中，爲繁雜的世事所擾，夜裏我也曾作過夢的，然而這夢没有詩人所説的那樣美麗，我夢見普遍全國的大旱災，污潦滿地廬舍爲墟的大水，和無數人在死亡綫上的挣扎，我覺得這不是美夢而是噩夢，於是一陣恐怖的壓迫之下，從夢中驚醒過來。……　　「夏夜夢」從另一方面看來是頗爲醜惡的！　　可是有些人對這水深火熱的整個民族之悲慘的運命熟視無覩，在用緋紅色的幻想來醉自已呢！裝在他們腮邊的是輕快的　笑，塞滿他們腦子裏的是快樂的憧憬，「夏夜夢」作得正起勁正開心呢！粉衫的飄影，眼波的流盼，小樂曲的纖柔，都給這美麗的夢境加添上無限的妝飾，如薔薇月季之妝飾一個美好的花圃，而這些在「地獄上的天堂」中跳躍着的人們，將永遠在幸福的波漩中沉溺下去，下去。……　　醒醒吧！作着「夏夜夢」的人們呀！從辫子金蓮等談到近代文明  阿咪　　留學回來的洋狀元們，一到中國，大都揑緊鼻子説中國遍地是臭，此外；如高級的印貼列追亞，也都侈談古老的中國民族之「吃老鼠，吃蛇，看殺頭，以及男人的辫子，女人的金蓮等」；引爲樂事，而表示對於封建殘餘意識之恨毒。我並不是對於封建社會的留連，存「老去無端玩骨董，閒來隨分種胡麻」之意，但我至少承認這種態度，是近於和中國民族開玩笑。　　社會制度正和一件衣服，封建制度在歷史的某一階段，也曾有過歷史的功業，因時代的輪是旋轉着的，封建的衣服，不但是狹窄得穿不上，並且是腐爛了，－可説是殘餘的殘餘－在目前資本主義已完畢了牠的歷史任務，資本主義社會的意識形態，也都表示了「末日將降」的象徵。　　「吃老鼠，吃蛇」的把戲，是重現在資本主義社會裏；並且變本加厲地變成「吃人］，有形的無形的吃人的事，在資本主義社會裏每日每夜地演出着，至於辫子金蓮，在我們愛時髦的少爺小姐身上，也都有此種遺風之存在，　　「看殺頭」有人認爲中國人的一種先天的閒情，但這種風氣已流傳太平洋西岸的文明國家了。大盜狄林格的伏誅，（見七·二十五申報）美國的上流紳士階級，願以百元的高價競買血衫一件，街磚四塊，並以一覩尸身爲快，這情形楫似如美國人所云的「野蠻的支那人」底看殺頭的風味，另外以高價買血磚血衣也極似我們以「饅頭蘸血吃」一樣。　　社會是日益地潰爛下去，我們目前所認爲的一種主要任務，卽是認清歷史的動向，與這種社會以一針有效的清血針。浪子（木刻）  羅淸楨作三個「本社應如何」  王慈　　吃了數年的粉筆粉，給予我第一個壞印象是：「小孩子歡喜戴大帽子。」　　在白話文秘密時期，呌孩子們作起文來，普通十個題目裏，有六七個可以磁套上一個千篇一例的大帽子：　　「夫國家之强弱，民族之盛衰，全賴乎……」　　（現在已經改成了：「我們中國，已經衰弱到極點了，九一八，一二八…」－冷眼望去是同調的，不過後者似乎參入了些「時髦意味」－）　　這末戴着，不論那頭顱兒是那末地又尖又小，軀幹兒是那末地又狹又矮。　　咱常常敎訓他們：　　「孩子們！你們戴這個帽子，我看來又舊，又大，又沉悶，又可憐，你們不覺得難過嗎？」　　縱然常常這末説，歸根兒是依然改不掉。有幾個伶俐的孩子反而會在背地里説：　　「各人有各人的主張，各人有各人的個性，不戴這帽子我過不來生活！」　　最近有幾個不知名的青年作家發起了一個「×風文藝社」，開成立大會時三斧頭的議案，就是三個大帽子：　　（一）××提倡××文學，鼓吹××××，爲害國家治安，民族生存，本社應如何表示態度案。　　（二）×××提倡幽默文學，消沉民族意識，清談禍國，本社應如何表示態度案。　　（三）本社應如何聯合各地青年作家對於浪漫頽廢封建奴化以及普羅文藝一致總攻擊案。　　二「國」二「民族」，三個「本社應如何」，已暴露了這多大的帽子。　　孩子們！你們戴這個帽子，我看來又大又舊，又沉悶又可憐，你們不覺得難過嗎？（却酬）駡人有藝術  曼之　　聰明人常常會翻新花樣，就連駡人都有藝術。而且駡人的藝術，其妙處使得受駡的人拍案呌絶，只覺文章寫得好，受駡反而不在乎。於是乎文壇上有駡人大師，由大師傳授出許許多多的徒子徒孫來。　　據某刋物所載的「駡人的藝術，」分爲應用兵法的精華與應用訟典的精華兩種駡法，原來駡人的藝術還是熟讀兵法與祖傳訟典變化而成，眞是學識淵博，令人佩服得五體投地。關於兵法的，（一）知已知彼，（二）以退爲進，（三）旁攻側擊，（四）避實擊虚，（五）面守面守，（六）個别擊破，（似乎是各個擊破？）　（七）誘敵深入，（八）化整爲零，（九）聲東擊西，（十）以逸待勞，關於訟典的，一强詞奪理，二抹煞事實，三避重就輕，四顚倒黑白，五小題大做，六掩飾已短，七舊案重提，八揭私報復，九借題發揮，十人身攻擊，－難怪駡人之風大盛，而被駡的人往往打了敗仗，他們是軍師與訟師呵！　　現在有人以「傳名術」來駡人，對於引證事實，造謡附會，務必駡人來自圓其説，而且一方在駡人傳名，一方又要自已傳名，這種駡人的藝術，大概是應用兵法上的「以退爲進」，及應用訟典上的「借題發揮」了。那人摇着羽毛扇而出塲，像也是駡人大師的高徒。我想此風一長，將來駡人大師的徒子徒孫滿天下，中國文壇就給大師的羽毛扇統一了的也未可知。班門弄斧記  穆琳　　單行本出版，洋洋乎總有幾篇介紹式的序文，這似乎古已有多，不必多説。寫序文的人，亦總是知名之士，是則該單行本可以「佛脚上帶帶」而不脛而走，這亦從古已然，不必多説。　　今春，「我的朋友」要我替「他的朋友」將載刋於某副刋的小説出單行本寫個序。竊查「他的朋友」本屬知名之士，就是也寫寫序文之流的，從前的「×花瓶」曾賣過許多鈔票。「我的朋友」提出這個議來，我認爲又是蕭伯納造的孽。誰料第二次遇見「我的朋友」，他果將「他的朋友」刋載大作之報章授我，這彷彿幽默已近乎胡鬧了，白鼻子總得抹一抹，不管三七二十一拿回來拜讀大作，亦像煞有介事寫起序來。　　上月在某書局發見該書已出版，細翻之下，從××閣上的怪事起，完全無缺，獨序無有。一想班門弄斧，眞是自討没趣，再想敝帚自珍，要回來自已讀讀，也够消遣；乃託友馳書，雙管齊下，然而石沉大海，只聽來一句「遺失了怎末樣？」　　後造某播音臺訪友，得悉「我的朋友」的「他的朋友」已放下筆桿玩「觀音戲」。所以「遺失了怎末樣！」描寫劇中人劉將軍之軍閥脾氣，維妙維肖，如此人材，不可多得？我輩文人丢下筆桿兒來只好告地狀者，眞愧煞人也？　　昔讀三字經，開卷曰：「人之初，性本善。」我深疑作才不忠實，今始恍然，寫「人之初」者也蒙上假面具而説「性本善。」班門弄斧記是乃一好敎訓，因録之以爲戒。自我職業介紹　　某君，廣東中山人，現年二十六歲，曾肄業於某大學，歷任各大洋行機關要職，擅長英文速記，打字及翻譯，今願就洋行機關文牘或翻譯，薪水八十元，台有上項職務，徵求人材者，請通函本埠東百老匯路源昌里二十四號林景華君轉。　　啟事　弌龍先生鑒，尊稿「高橋海濱所見」爲業餘週刋移用，領酬時請註明業餘週刋可也。　　增刋編輯室小説短篇小説乘凉（二）  文里　　這×××花園，靠東南那一角是跳舞廳，西北兩面才是花園，而所謂花園只有一小地方種了兩三株柳樹和其他小雜樹圍住一個噴水池，其餘的地方是高而夫球塲。那高而夫球塲也有小山也有小洞，以及離奇古怪呌不出名字來的裝置，總之打球從開始到一要了，一定要經過那許許多多的裝置，使紳士小姐太太老爺有趣開心。這且不去説它，Ｎ跟着那位朋友Ｃ到了西邊一角，揀了一個桌子，就圍坐下來；那桌子恰恰是被一把有做的大得不能再大的傘兒張在上面蓋着，這傘好令人想起從電影裏頭看到的海濱浴塲的東西。Ｎ心裏暗想着：這傘兒决不是用來遮雨露的，白天這裏一定是開着，人們用它遮蔽酷烈的太陽；可是白天那麽熱，到這裏來乘凉的怕只怕有儍氣的人了吧？Ｃ是和電影界的藝人熟的，只見他和許多人招呼，Ｎ暗問他是誰，原來都是一些導演家與明星們。Ｎ心裏暗自在想着，電影從業員到底比較女人闊氣些，換句話説，他們的生活是比較摩登化，資産階級化了。　　舞廳上，紅的燈光，綠的燈光，紫的燈光，時常變換着，音樂快的慢的時常跟着燈光更易着，有的曲子聽去就好像戰爭已經開始，萬馬奔騰，是那麽急驟，那麽短促的音響在綁緊了人們的心，血在腔裏沸騰着；有的曲子那就令人喪志凄凉，好像國破人亡的孤兒寡婦在哭訴着她的哀史一般，聽去心裏怪難受　　—跳舞嗎？Ｃ問着。　　－不，聽音樂多好。　　Ｎ再解釋着他只是來乘凉。　　然而，人們在舞廳門口進進出出，紳士小姐們跳舞得正在沉醉入夢呢。　　忽然，乘凉的人們起了一陣小小的騷動，交頭接耳地説着話，眼睛兒都朝着那邊瞧，Ｃ低低告訴Ｎ説。　　－××。　　Ｎ的腦裏意識到那是一個電影女明星，他的眼睛跟着人們瞧去，正是她。比較在銀幕上看見的胖得多啦。她到處和人招呼，終於走一走，走進南邊角上的露天小舞塲裏頭去了。有的人跟進去。　　－難怪這裏乘凉的人那麽多：有跳舞，有音樂，還有電影明星來點綴風景　　Ｎ説着，Ｃ笑了，説是未免太批評家的地。　　凉風從南邊角上吹來，帶來了音樂的音符，帶來了小姐太太們的脂粉香水的味兒，Ｎ是聞不慣的，不知是不是着了凉，打了兩三個噴嚔，Ｃ問着怎麽啦？Ｎ答道，「給香水味兒打壞了！」Ｃ又笑了，笑他鄉下人，没福亨受。Ｎ坐在紳士小姐太太老爺的叢裏名呌在乘凉，事實上他是侷促不安，汗水在額角流着，心頭時常在跳動，他不願意再乘凉下去了，堅持要走，Ｃ説他要坐下去，没法，Ｎ獨個兒狼狽地走出了那如夢如幻的境界；—在他是走出了魔窟。　　夜已經深了，公共汽車没有，電車也没有，Ｎ心想好久没有在深夜裏逛馬路，今晚就這樣乘凉走着回家吧，黄包車圍來不理他，一步一步地朝南走下來。靜安寺路上靜悄悄地没有其他的行人，夏夜之風溫柔地撫摸着Ｎ的頭髮，空氣是比較×××花園清潔得多。</p>

Chen's life or death is unknown. Shen returned to Quanzhou on the 29th, ordering the 517th Regiment to patrol Datian. Zhangzhou has been sending airplanes for days to Qingliu, Ninghua, and Changting bandit areas to distribute 240,000 copies of propaganda, stating that only the bandit leaders will be killed, and those who were coerced will not be held accountable. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Fuzhou) The Red Bandits in Fujian, as our army began to encircle and suppress them, were supposed to be wiped out within a set time frame. Recently, they have been attempting to cause disturbances again. Remnants of Peng Dehuai's forces have been discovered in Datian in our rear, and they are currently being encircled by our army. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Military sources report that the bandit scouts' signs are twelve copper coins, green paper strips, and red plaster, all of which have been intercepted by us and are being closely guarded against, so the bandits will not succeed. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Visits Huang, then Stays on Mountain Waiting for Tang Youren</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports, Yin Tong was scheduled to arrive in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 29th, and many reporters went to the station early in the morning to meet him. However, Yin did not arrive. According to those traveling with him, Yin was originally scheduled to enter Nanjing on the evening of the 28th and had booked a sleeper berth, but when the train departed, Yin did not board and repeatedly unloaded his luggage. It is said that Yin temporarily suspended his trip to Nanjing because Tang Youren went to Moganshan to meet with Huang, and they had some discussions. He will come to Nanjing after the discussions in Moganshan. It is also said that Huang Fu will take advantage of Wang's trip to Lushan to speak to summer military officers on the 5th or 6th of next month and also go to Lushan for a trip before returning to the north to take office. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreigners believe that Huang Fu's return north to his post is only a matter of time. It is believed that Huang's return to the north will be in early October. After Yin Tong visits Huang and he returns to the north, the unfinished issues in the war zone will be easily resolved. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Confirmed news that Tang Youren took a train from Shanghai on the morning of the 29th to Moganshan to visit Huang Fu and discuss the unfinished issues in the North China war zone and urge Huang to go north to preside over government affairs. Tang is expected to return to Nanjing next Wednesday. Also, Yin Tong returned to Shanghai from Dalian to visit Tang Youren and report on the negotiations with the Japanese representatives, and then went to Moganshan to report to Huang. He was originally scheduled to go down the mountain on the 28th and return to Shanghai and take a train to Nanjing that night. However, because Tang Youren went to Mogan, he stayed on the mountain to wait for the meeting. However, Yin's staff in Shanghai did not know that he had changed his travel plans. On the evening of the 28th, they booked two first-class seats on the Shanghai-Nanjing night train and sent his luggage to the train. It was not until 11 p.m., when the train was about to depart, that Yin had not arrived, so they unloaded the luggage, leading to the misunderstanding that Mr. Yin entered Nanjing on the evening of the 28th.

<p>(Beiping) After Doihara arrived in Rehe, it attracted much attention. It is said that his trip to Rehe is in preparation for the Japanese army to increase defenses at various passes along the Great Wall. Because the Japanese army along the Great Wall has only relatively strong forces in the Japanese army at Shanhaiguan, Xifengkou, and the puppet army of Li Shouxin's department in eastern Chahar, Japan has decided to distribute military force equally at each pass along the Great Wall for the sake of equalizing military strength.

The Japanese garrison stationed in Shanhaiguan and the Japanese army in Dongluocheng have been conducting live-fire exercises in the Jiaoshan area for days, firing flat-trajectory guns. However, the Kwantung Army gendarmerie in the city and the puppet police headquarters outside the city have not been withdrawn. A large number of bandits were discovered in Dabiejie Village, west of Shanhaiguan, a few days ago, and they ransacked the homes of the villagers, causing great anxiety among the people. Security has been very strict in various places northwest of Shanhaiguan until late at night. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Already Holds an Absolute Advantage in Trade with China</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Business circles report that Japan's trade with China in the first half of this year totaled 111.25 million Japanese yen, an increase of 25.59 million Japanese yen compared to the same period last year. The export of Japanese goods to China totaled 51.54 million Japanese yen, an increase of 2.78 million Japanese yen compared to the same period last year. If the Northeast and Hong Kong are added, the total trade volume reaches 300 million Japanese yen, which occupies an absolutely superior position in the trade of various countries with China. Now that the new tariff is revised, the import of Japanese goods into the mainland is slightly facilitated, and the export to our country in the second half of this year will increase. The movement to resist Japanese goods in the north and south has become a non-issue, it is said. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At about 11 o'clock on the night of the 28th, a passenger and freight train collided on the Beining Beidaihe seaside branch line. The reason was that Zheng Baozhao, deputy director of Beining, accompanied by his two young sons and Wang Fengrui, the former director of the Beining Road Vehicle Department, took the seaside passenger train to escape the heat. Because the road gate worker incorrectly switched the track, it collided with a freight train parked at Beidaihe Station. Two sections of the passenger and freight train were destroyed. Zheng was slightly injured, his two sons were seriously injured, and Wang Fengrui's leg was fractured. The station staff rescued and sent them to the seaside hospital. The road gate worker has fled for fear of punishment. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Liu Wenhui's Opinion on Resolving the Kang-Tibet Dispute</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) When Huang Musong passed through Xikang, Liu Wenhui offered advice on a fundamental solution to the Kang-Tibet dispute, which Huang forwarded to the central government. It has now arrived. The main points of the content are: The relationship between China and Tibet began in the early Tang Dynasty. The Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties used both kindness and power, so the territory of Tibet has always belonged to us. Since the United Kingdom annexed India in the 21st year of Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty, envoys who spied on Tibet have never ceased. Since the Republic of China, disputes have arisen repeatedly. The Great Hundred Incident occurred in the 20th year of the Republic of China and has been entangled until now. The path to resolution today can be divided into two points: A. All matters concerning British India, Russia, Mongolia, and Tibet fall under this category. B. All matters concerning Kang-Tibet, Qing-Tibet, and Yunnan-Tibet fall under this category. For item A, seeking a solution involves not only China and foreign countries but also contains extremely complex issues. Item B focuses on the Kang-Tibet dispute, and it is expected that no matter what method is taken, it will not be difficult to obtain considerable results. The crux of the Kang-Tibet dispute lies in the settlement of the border issue. The Danda Mountain should be the boundary. Secondly, the Tibetan region should also be extended to the west of Qamdo. Two minimum standards are proposed: 1. According to the previous Qing Dynasty's border Tibet settlement, all the land under the jurisdiction of the Khutuktu should be given to Tibet, such as Zhalaiyaojue and Qamdo, which should all belong to Tibet. All the land belonging to the Tusi should belong to Kang, such as Yanjing, Jiangka Sanyan, Baiyu, Tongpu, Dege, Dengke, Shiqu, and Shixian. According to the original Tibetan territory, they belong to Kang. 2. Temporarily follow the existing peace treaty, starting from Wucheng in the south and the downstream of the Jinsha River, going upstream to Dengke, with the east and west banks as the border line between Kang and Tibet, and the ten counties on the east bank that were originally under the jurisdiction of the west bank should still return to the old system. As for Yanjing County, it belongs to its jurisdiction. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>On Today's Tanggu Truce</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese unresolved issues arising from the September 18th Incident, before the conclusion of the Tanggu Truce, were extremely serious international problems. After the Tanggu Truce was concluded, it largely transformed into a simple issue involving China and Japan. As such, Japan regards the truce as a "rare commodity" and is unwilling to easily abandon it. However, in this process of more than a year, the Japanese psychology of valuing the truce has changed. When the truce was signed, the Japanese felt that this document could prevent China from restoring the military actions of the lost territories outside the customs. Therefore, the truce was useful to them. However, after China fulfilled its obligations, the Japanese army had to be withdrawn to the line of the Great Wall. Thus, the truce itself became not only useless to them but also an obstacle. Let us observe the internal and external situations with an open mind and then ask ourselves whether the Sino-Japanese unresolved issues after the September 18th Incident can be restored to their initial international seriousness or encourage us to lead troops out of the customs if we simply abolish the Tanggu Truce now. The answer is undoubtedly negative. It can be seen that abolishing the truce is not enough to increase the difficulties for the Japanese. Not abolishing it can instead make China protest against their freedom of action in North China. In that case, it should be Japan that wants to abolish the truce now, and China is secondary. The Japanese have seen through this point and deliberately violated the truce's troop withdrawal conditions, deliberately condoning the actions of rogue Japanese and Chinese traitors in the war zone, just to make us feel embarrassed and force us to propose negotiations on the war zone truce, so that they can take the opportunity to make further use of it. The advantages and disadvantages of the Tanggu Truce have long been evaluated by the Chinese people. We certainly hope to abolish the truce as soon as possible, but the timing must be after the Japanese have fulfilled their truce obligations. Otherwise, in today's realistic environment, talking about abolishing the truce is just being used by the Japanese and will not bring any benefits.</p>
<p>Both China and Japan find the Tanggu Truce annoying, but their motives are completely different. China aims to eliminate the truce, while Japan uses it as a means. China hopes to implement the truce to show sincerity and then talk about abolishing it, while Japan wants to use the failure to fulfill its obligations as a means to force negotiations for revision. With such diametrically opposed directions, there is originally no room for maneuver. However, the psychology of both sides being annoyed by the truce is still consistent. There is such a similarity in the contradiction, so there is still the fact of negotiation.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the key to the complicated North China issue lies in the survival of the Tanggu Truce. If this point has a solution, all the rest can be easily solved. But it is not easy to talk about it before the Japanese stance has changed. For example, we regard the North China issue as a national issue, while the Japanese regard it as a local issue. We want to negotiate the unresolved issues in the war zone based on the truce and have it handled by the central government, while the Japanese insist that the Kwantung Army come forward. The recent Sino-Japanese negotiations were conducted by Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and the arrogant representative of the Kwantung Army, rather than by central government personnel as the counterpart. The general public suspects that there will not be a very satisfactory result. If there is a considerable result, it will definitely not be unconditional. Since there are conditions, I am afraid it will not be beneficial to us. We must recognize that it is better not to negotiate than to negotiate with harsh conditions on the unresolved issues in the war zone centered on the Tanggu Truce. If we are afraid that the Japanese will act recklessly if we do not negotiate, then we must pay attention to resistance with actual strength. Before the resistance capacity has been fully cultivated, we can only adhere to the principle of saying, "You can forcibly occupy, at your own convenience. But you must never get me to acknowledge it." This was our stance on the Northeast issue after September 18th. Now, on the North China issue, we must not retreat a single step.</p>
<p>The winds of the Russo-Japanese War are gradually thickening. However, Japan will not act rashly until it has sufficient control over China. Although there is more than one weapon Japan uses to control China, the Tanggu Truce is clearly the most convenient. They are now trying to use illegitimate means to use the truce to oppress China and expand the temporary and local military truce into a permanent political and economic truce that affects the whole country, so as to facilitate their war against Russia. Once the Russo-Japanese War breaks out, China will inevitably suffer significant sacrifices. Therefore, we must get rid of Japanese control to delay the arrival of the Russo-Japanese war. If it is said that we may have the possibility of recovering the lost territories in the Northeast after the Russo-Japanese War, then we must not be threatened by the Japanese at present and expand or extend the Tanggu Truce. Originally, even if we abolished the Tanggu Truce before the Japanese policy toward China had fundamentally changed, it would still be nominal. However, even if we do not propose to abolish it, the Japanese will still propose to expand it. We must resolutely reject their unreasonable demands and not make the same mistake again.</p>
<h3>Korean Registered as Russian in Russian Espionage Case</h3>
<p>Japan Wants to Shelter, No Way to Do So</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Japanese Embassy Counselor to the Soviet Union, Sakao, visited the acting director of the Second Eastern Department of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Yukikevich, on July 26, regarding the Korean Kim San Yuan, who was recently convicted of espionage and sabotage on the railway. The announcement of the case included the following statement, namely, that Kim came from Manchuria and said that in this case, he must be a Japanese citizen. It is heard that Sakao stated in this regard that if Kim is indeed a Japanese, the embassy would very much like to know the details of his crime and would like to speak with the prisoner in the capacity of a national representative. Yukikevich notified Sakao on July 27 that after Kim San Yuan came from Manchuria, he requested the Soviet authorities to allow him to become a Soviet citizen on September 5, 1928, and he was granted Soviet citizenship on October 10, 1929. Thus, the question raised by the Japanese Embassy was put to rest. (28th TASS Telegram)</p>

<h3>Grand Funeral of the Deceased Austrian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>The Ceremony Was Solemn, Unseen Since Austrian Emperor Joseph</p>
<p>Dollfuss Sacrificed for the Country</p>
<p>A Hero Immortal</p>
<p>Vienna The last scene of the Vienna tragedy came to an end today with the burial of Dollfuss' remains. Today's funeral of Mr. Tao was extremely grand and was the greatest event since Austrian Emperor Joseph. Since yesterday, most of the houses in the capital have hung national flags with black gauze attached. Today, the form of mourning is everywhere. All public and private houses hang black flags. Members of the "Fatherland Front" had made meticulous arrangements for the order and security of the funeral in advance. The "People's Hall" was closed in the middle of the day, and Dollfuss' coffin was moved to the square in front of the city hall. Around it stood the honorary guards organized by students, military police, etc. The funeral ceremony was held at 2:30 PM and was broadcast by radio to the entire territory of Austria, Italy, Hungary, and 417 stations in North America. First, Archbishop Innitzer blessed Dollfuss' remains, and then President Miklas and Deputy Prime Minister Steinhauser successively delivered speeches. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Vienna Dr. Dollfuss, the deceased Prime Minister, was buried at the Haitzin Cemetery yesterday. When the funeral was held, Austrian President Miklas delivered a speech describing Mr. Doo's loyalty to the country. The coffin was first moved from the City Hall to St. Stephen's Cathedral, and then from the Cathedral to the Haitzin Cemetery.</p>
<h3>The Ceremony Was Solemn and Solemn</h3>
<p>The scene at that time was extremely solemn. Airplanes soared in the sky, with countless long black ribbons tied to the planes, fluttering in the wind. Along the way, there were teams carrying machine guns stationed every yard. Inside the church, there were police officers carrying rifles. All entrances to Lassoss Guard, where the city hall is located, were guarded by machine gunners, and anti-aircraft guns were mounted in several locations.</p>
<h3>The President Recalled His Achievements</h3>
<p>President Mislas said in his speech that Dr. Dollfuss had saved Austria and prevented it from losing its soul, so that the country could be spared from becoming a battlefield and from being destroyed in the turmoil in Central Europe. Therefore, the Prime Minister not only preserved Austria but also preserved the peace of Europe. He ended this career with his own blood and became a martyr for Austrianism. (Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Pledge to Inherit His Legacy</h3>

<h3>Strict Security Along the Way</h3>
<p>The funeral was held in a tense atmosphere, because rumors were spreading that the National Socialist Party would make a final attempt to eliminate the President and the entire cabinet. It was even said that people had seen party members carrying blooming cannons. Therefore, the temporary security yesterday was very strict. All windows from which bombs could be thrown were guarded by police or soldiers. Only a thousand or so guests were allowed to enter Lassoss Street. (Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Scene of the Coffin's Departure</h3>
<p>After the speeches, the coffin, covered with the national flag and a garden of red and white roses, was slowly carried out of the city hall auditorium.

After the coffin was placed on a hearse, it was pulled by six black horses to St. Stephen's Cathedral, where Archbishop Innitzer performed the religious ceremony. (Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Procession Was Miles Long</h3>
<p>The procession was miles long. The entire cabinet walked in the funeral procession, led by Acting Prime Minister Prince Steinhauser. Among them were members of the diplomatic corps and representatives from all parts of Austria. Mrs. Doo, wearing a long black veil, walked in the procession, and all who saw her were moved.</p>
<p>When the coffin set off, some women sobbed. Among the procession were the Catholic Guard in purple uniforms (i.e., those led by Archbishop Schuschnigg), the National Guard in green uniforms, and university students in school uniforms. Many civil and military officials held the ropes of the coffin. At that time, Senator Peimerdino, the special envoy sent by Italy's Mussolini, arrived from Rome and joined the procession.

<h3>The Church Has Seen Centuries of Change</h3>
<p>Mrs. Dollfuss walked with the coffin, supported by Steinhauser and Minister of Commerce Stockinger along the way. There were thousands of spectators along the way. She then arrived at St. Edina's Cathedral. The construction of this cathedral was even before the expulsion of the Turkish army from Vienna in 1683. It has gone through centuries of change and has been around for hundreds of years. Archbishop Iniciel delivered a speech, saying that the entire Catholic Church could not help but mourn.

The color of the flowers and leaves has not completely faded, and the doctor has followed his deceased son to the underworld. The doctor still has a son and a daughter, who are still playing in Leisean, and do not know the bad news of their father. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Steinhauser Expresses Determination to the Outside World to Protect Austrian Independence</h3>
<p>The Government and the People Share the Same Will</p>
<p>The Spirit of Dollfuss Will Never Die</p>
<p>(Paris) Prince Steinhauser recently issued the following statement to a correspondent stationed in Austria for Le Petit Parisien: "Austria's long-held concept is to serve the cause of justice. Germanism is not enough, and it must undertake a mission for the whole of Europe to make up for it. Austria, inspired by this concept, will strive for its absolute independence and its future opportunities. It will never stop as long as it breathes. The people and the government can trust each other closely, unite as one, and patriotic comrades can dedicate themselves to the country without any restrictions. All administrative organs, soldiers on duty, and members of the volunteer army can be loyal to themselves without any reservations. All of this is so that the government, in a matter of hours, will wipe out the attempts of rebellious elements to carry out a coup, and these rebellious elements deserve what they get and have nothing to do with the true Austrian people. The assassination of Prime Minister Dollfuss caused inexpressible hatred and gnashing of teeth throughout the country. Although the brave leader has passed away, the whole country holds the confidence to continue the legacy of the deceased, which is also enough to enable the Austrian people to accomplish the greatest cause by their own efforts and to move forward to a great future with the spirit of national unity. Dollfuss is dead, but Dollfuss's will and his wishes survive in the hearts of all patriotic Austrians and will never be extinguished. The future and revival of Austria are enough to represent the future and revival of the whole of Europe." (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Dollfuss's Last Writings</h3>
<p>Guarantee Independence and Seek Economic Revival</p>
<p>National Self-Determination Should Transcend Everything</p>
<p>(London) The "Sunday Dispatch" will publish the last writings of the late Austrian State Secretary Dollfuss tomorrow. The general idea is that Austria's policy is to guarantee its own independence, so that Austria can live in harmony with the countries in the Danube River basin. This policy is by no means an isolated policy. Maintaining Austria's independence and its right to national self-determination should transcend everything. The article also states that for fifteen years, Austria's economic problems have only been the target of debate by various political parties. In the future, it will be possible to transcend the interests of political parties and seek economic revival, and this economic revival will not harm the interests of the middle class.

<p>Japanese-Dutch Conference Still Deadlocked</p>
<p>Both Sides Insist on Their Positions</p>
<p>Situation Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Batavia Communication Since the Netherlands East Indies government adopted a policy of restricting Japanese imports, the ensuing Japanese-Dutch conference has been ongoing for over a month. In previous meetings, the Japanese side, citing the "most-favored-nation treatment" clause in the Japanese-Dutch trade treaty, opposed the restrictions, while the Dutch side countered with the "absolute right of the country to economic freedom."</p>
<p>Therefore, the two sides engaged in heated verbal exchanges, creating a tense situation. Regarding the issue of commodity exchange, opinions were also greatly divided. The Dutch side was eager to find a way out for its overproduced sugar, but the Japanese side, due to concerns about Taiwanese sugar, was unwilling to accept it, resulting in a deadlock. Although a decision was made to establish a committee of experts for detailed consideration to ease the tension and prevent the conference from breaking down immediately, observations of the situation in recent days indicate that the opinions of the two sides have not come closer. In other words, both sides still insist on their respective principles. Therefore, the temporary improvement achieved through the expert conference has now reverted to the standoff that existed before June 26th. Recent private discussions between the chief Japanese representative, Mr. Nagaoka, and the chief Dutch representative, Mr. Meulen, have reportedly not yielded any progress. It is said that another meeting will be held on July 16th to strive to break this deadlock, but the future remains uncertain. (21st)</p>

<p>Yin Tong Talks About Partial Resolution of War Zone Issues at Dalian Conference</p>
<p>Malan Pass and Eastern Mausoleums to Be Received Soon</p>
<p>Issue of Withdrawal of Puppet Troops Also Resolved</p>
<p>New Security Force Numbering 9,000</p>
<p>Huang Fu's Trip North Still Undetermined</p>
<p>Moganshan Communication, Yin Tong, Director of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway Bureau, was ordered by Huang Fu, Chairman of the Pingzheng Rectification Committee, to attend the Sino-Japanese conference in Dalian as a representative to discuss and resolve war zone issues with Japanese representatives Okamura Yasuji, Kita, Shibayama, etc. On the 25th of this month, after completing his mission, he took the Dalian Maru south to meet with Huang to report on the progress. At 3:40 p.m. on the 27th, the ship arrived in Shanghai, and he went ashore to meet with Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, to report on the situation. Tang originally intended to represent President Wang again to go to Moganshan to urge Huang to go north. Considering that the difficult issues in North China had been partially resolved and a glimmer of hope had emerged, he entrusted Yin to convey his urging to Huang, requesting him to return north as soon as possible to take charge of the overall situation. Yin quietly took the 6:30 p.m. Shanghai-Hangzhou express train to Hangzhou, without anyone being aware of it. He arrived at the city station at 12:15 a.m., hired a car to Xin Xin Hotel No. 44 on the West Lake. Accompanying him were Deputy Adjutant Liu and two others. Yin was dressed in a white calico long gown, wearing a Panama white hat and white leather shoes, carrying a yellow cane. With his hat covering his eyebrows, he was not easily recognized by others. At 7:00 a.m. on the 28th, he hired a small chartered car and drove straight to Moganshan, arriving at Gengcun Station at 8:05 a.m. He switched to a sedan chair and went up the mountain to Huang Fu's private residence at No. 509 to report on the conference's progress. He also had lunch at Huang's residence and continued to talk at length until 5:00 p.m., when he returned to No. 1 Caigenxiang Hotel. The reporter then went to visit him. Yin received him and said that he had negotiated with the Japanese side and had ten hours of talks over two days. Although the Chinese side was not entirely satisfied, the war zone issue had been partially resolved. The talks proceeded quickly and smoothly, which was somewhat gratifying. The content included the resolution of issues such as the receipt of Malan Pass and the Eastern Mausoleums, the withdrawal of puppet troops, and the decision to deploy a newly编 security force of 9,000 troops into the war zone, which was agreed upon by the Japanese side. The issue of carrying heavy firearms was not discussed. The withdrawal of Japanese troops from the various passes of the Great Wall and Jianchangying, Saheqiao, etc., was indefinite. The reorganization of the security forces of Zhao Lei, Liu Zuozhou, and others by the Chinese side was also understood by the other party. The Japanese-Korean illegal ronin will be thoroughly suppressed by the Chinese side and all will be detained and sent to the Japanese consulate for deportation. The above items can be implemented within days, and many other minor issues have been resolved. The date of continued consultation is yet to be determined, and the location will be in places like Beiping and Tianjin. After reporting to Huang in detail today, Huang is planning to receive Malanyu Eastern Mausoleums and the residences of puppet troops, and has sent instructions to Yu Xuezhong, Yin Rugeng, and Tao Shangming. Huang's trip north is undetermined. Yin himself, due to unhealed foot ailments, plans to stay on the mountain for a day or two of rest and will return to Beiping at the end of the month. Tang, Vice Minister, has entrusted him to represent him in urging Chairman Huang to return north to take charge of the overall situation in North China, and Tang himself will no longer come here. He will visit Huang again tomorrow morning to urge him to go north to take charge of the overall situation in North China, and so on. At this point, Yin was about to have dinner, so the reporter took his leave. (29th)</p>
<p>Rubber Prices to Rise After Production Restrictions</p>
<p>Agreement Established by Governments of British and Dutch Territories</p>
<p>Only Over 500,000 Tons Allowed This Year</p>
<p>Singapore Communication The reporter previously investigated the domestic goods industry in Shanghai and paid special attention to it due to the close relationship between China's rubber manufacturing industry and the rubber industry in Southeast Asia. According to the reporter's investigation, there are currently 45 rubber factories operated by Chinese in Shanghai, one with capital over one million, two with capital over 200,000, seven with capital over 100,000, and the rest with capital of 50,000 to 60,000 or less. The total annual production value of all factories is estimated to be over 30 million yuan, which is a considerable amount, and the amount of raw materials used is also considerable. Moreover, most of the products of the factories are daily necessities such as galoshes, sports shoes, and hot water bottles, which everyone needs. Therefore, the rise and fall of rubber raw material prices not only have a significant impact on the industry but also have a relationship with the people's livelihood in China. As a result, the reporter has to report the recent trend of the rubber market in Malaya to the compatriots in the motherland.</p>
<p>The largest special products of British Malaya are rubber and tin, which those who have studied the situation in Southeast Asia can generally say. It is no exaggeration to say that the prosperity of Malaya in the past was created by rubber and tin. Since the world was shrouded in depression, rubber and tin both suffered from the pain of overproduction, so the market price plummeted. Later, due to the restrictions imposed by the international production restriction agreement on the tin industry, prices did not fall sharply, while rubber prices fell due to the differences in opinion between the governments and rubber merchants of British and Dutch territories. Until April and May of this year, the two sides began negotiations again, and finally, a restriction agreement was established. This agreement was finally approved by the governments of the two countries and implemented on June 1st of this year. Since the implementation of this agreement, the production quotas of each rubber-producing area have been strictly regulated and absolutely not allowed to exceed this limit. As for the impact of the implementation of this agreement, it is also quite valuable to study. The province's rubber production is less than Malaya, so we can temporarily put it aside. Let's first discuss Malaya. According to this restriction agreement, only 500,000 and 4,000 tons are allowed to be exported this year. Now, starting from January to June of this year, according to the report of the local government statistics bureau, the cumulative number has reached 350,766 million tons. If this number is deducted from 500,000 and 4,000 tons, then only 153,234 tons remain. In other words, only 150,000 tons will be allowed to be exported this year, and no more exports will be allowed. Before the restriction agreement was implemented, the average monthly export volume of Malaya was about 50,000 tons. If we still calculate according to this normal export volume, then the quota will be full in less than three months. After the quota is full, Malaya will have no goods to supply for export. By then, if it is impossible to avoid exporting the quota for next year, there will be strict restrictions on the quantity, and it will never be as free as before. Moreover, since the United States has implemented the economic recovery movement, the consumption of rubber has been increasing day by day. Monthly statistics are all above 45,000 tons. The 150,000 tons that Malaya should get in the next six months is only enough to supply the consumption for more than three months. Therefore, it is expected that the supply of rubber raw materials in the world will fall short of demand in the second half of this year, resulting in a skyrocketing price. Domestic rubber industry operators, if they do not prepare early, will be greatly affected. I hope that our rubber merchants will pay attention to this three times. (19th)</p>
<p>Japan Indifferent to Pseudo-State Flood Disaster</p>
<p>Yalu River Surges, Andong Threatened with Submersion</p>
<p>Nen River Water Level Rises to 23 Feet 8 Inches</p>
<p>Chinese Eastern Railway Blocked, Caijiagou Submerged</p>
<p>Beiping Communication Since the Northeast was forcibly occupied by Japan and renamed the puppet state of Manchuria, no attention has been paid to governance. This year, since the beginning of summer, incessant rain has caused rivers to overflow, and a quarter of the entire territory has become a swamp. The Japanese are indifferent and prohibit news of the flood from leaking out. However, the residents of the Northeast are deeply suffering and have no way to appeal. Today, a newcomer from the Northeast said the following:</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the Liao River basin has been plagued by incessant rain, causing the Liao River tributaries Hun River, Zhi River, and Xinkai River to surge, resulting in the flooding of Liaozhong, Tai'an, Panshan, and the upstream counties of Xinmin and Zhangwu. Houses have collapsed and been destroyed, and countless people have been killed or injured. Farmland everywhere has been submerged, and the autumn harvest is completely hopeless. Grain prices in Liaoyang, Shenyang, and other places have soared, with white rice rising to 1.2 yuan per liter. Merchants and civilians alike are crying out in pain. The Yalu River on the eastern border of Liaoning has also surged. On the 20th of this month, the water level was 25 feet 8 inches higher than usual. The next day, the water overflowed the banks, and Andong was threatened with submersion. However, because the west bank of the Yalu River is mostly Korean paddy fields, it has been slightly alleviated.</p>
<p>In northern Manchuria, apart from the Harbin flood, which was slightly reported, no county along the Chinese Eastern Railway line has been spared. Wuchang, Zhuhe, and Yilan counties have all been completely washed away by the rising Songhua River. Tongjiang, Fujin, Huachuan, and other places have also experienced flooding. In Wuchang County, the water of the Lalin River is 30 feet deep and has flooded over 100 miles, causing many deaths among residents. Because guerrillas are lurking in the disaster-stricken areas, the Japanese are sitting idly by and not helping. In the southern part of the Chinese Eastern Railway, between Caijiagou and Lalin, the Lalin River has overflowed, and small boats on the river have drifted away without a trace. Food supplies have been completely cut off, and Caijiagou is now completely submerged in water. In the western part of the Chinese Eastern Railway, due to the overflow of floodwaters, the international train bound for the west on the 12th of this month was blocked between Genghis Khan (place name) and Nenzi Mountain. The railway between Qiqihar and Heishan is also completely impassable. The water level of the Nen River (now increased to 23 feet 8 inches, only 3 inches less than the previous high water level of 24 feet 1 inch) is only two or three inches away from the bridge girder of the Nen River Railway Bridge. If it rains again, it may suffer the same catastrophe as the flood of the previous year. The flow of the Nen River is about 8 kilometers per day. Once the flood suddenly arrives, Harbin will become a swamp within two days. (28th)</p>
<p>Chiang Returns to Nanchang from Lushan</p>
<p>Summons Senior Officials in the Province</p>
<p>To Return to Lushan to Preside Over Military Training</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication The first期 of officers trained by the Military Officer Training Corps, presided over by Chairman Chiang in Lushan, held its graduation ceremony on the 25th. Chiang himself presided over the ceremony and exhorted them to strive for a new life and to use propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as rules for self-cultivation and governance. After attending the ceremony, Chiang, together with Yang Yongtai, returned to Nanchang from Xingzi aboard the Minquan warship. The entourage and Cai Jingjun, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Headquarters, returned to the province by train via the Xunnan Line. On the 26th, when the Minquan warship docked at Dehe River, senior officials in the province went to the riverbank to welcome them. After Chiang went ashore, he went to his private residence on Yuanqiu Street to rest, process important military telegrams from the headquarters, and summon senior staff of the headquarters to listen to reports on handling everything related to the suppression of bandits and post-disaster recovery. Today (27th), he met with Director Gong Jian and various committee members to inquire about the province's politics and drought conditions. At 5 p.m., the closing ceremony of the New Life Club Water Sports Games was held. It was originally planned to go to give a speech, but due to all the important affairs to be dealt with and the endless stream of visitors, he was extremely busy and announced the cancellation of his attendance by telephone. It is heard that Chiang will still go to Lushan to preside over the second期 of military training after deploying matters in the province. Huang Jie, Wan Fulin, Li Shengda, Sun Ji, Li Jue, and others who were trained in this期 have arrived in Lushan one after another, and it is scheduled to start military training on the 1st of next month.

Traffic on the road was entirely by small boats. The heavy rain only stopped on the morning of the 23rd, but because the area of ​​rainfall was extremely wide, the torrent of the Jiulong River was still turbulent.

In the afternoon, the water rose even more, and Nanma Road Huaqiaoting Tushan Street Xinmen Street Tumen Street, all the way to Nan Street Hua Lane and other places, and the Nanmen Xinqiaotou area, were four feet deep in the evening. Nanma Road Shuibao Gate Huaqiaoting area was three feet deep, Pangongkou Zhuangfu Lane Hualane Kou was more than two feet deep. At twelve o'clock at night, the water was still rising and not receding, and the rain continued to fall. All the roads in Nanshi had been changed from land roads to waterways. Water traffic outside Nancheng was cut off. The power company west of Cai Gongzhou was flooded and stopped sending electricity, and the whole city was plunged into darkness. The rain stopped on the morning of the 23rd, and the floodwater gradually receded with the tide. On the morning of the 24th, the floodwater below Nan Street Huacao had completely receded. Before noon, Nanmen Road had also completely receded. Only Cai Gongzhou, Mipu, Nan 교塲, Tianzhongyang, Ximen, Xinmen Chengdou Shuimen Yibao Sanbao Wubao outside Nanmen had not receded.

Fortunately, no one was injured. There were a total of fourteen collapsed houses. Three bodies floated in the mountain torrents along the river in Xinqiao, one male, one female, and one thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy. Quanzhou city was severely affected by the disaster this time, especially the near city. More than 100 villages in the suburbs near various gates such as Fuyu Nannan Xinxi Tumen, Cai Gongzhou Tianzhongyang, etc., suffered heavy losses of agricultural products because they were mostly vegetables and fruit trees. This year was originally expected to be a one-third bumper harvest compared to previous years, but it was unexpectedly damaged by the water. According to the estimates of the township offices in the suburbs, the losses in the more than 100 villages in the suburbs should be more than 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The roads from Quanzhou to Tong'an and to Hui'an were cut off on the 21st and 22nd, and only opened on the afternoon of the 23rd. Tong'an had heavy water in the entire city and near the suburbs on the 21st and 22nd, with a depth of three feet to five feet. It completely receded on the morning of the 23rd. The early rice in Hui'an's outer suburbs and the northern area was being harvested, and it was devastated by wind and rain, leaving only 50% of the harvest.

It will take several days to restore traffic. Tong'an Tongmei Zhangtong also stopped for four days, and only managed to resume traffic on the 25th. (26th)</p>
<p>Rivers in Shandong Province Swell</p>
<p>Grand Canal Rises Abruptly by Nine Feet, River Water Flows Backwards</p>
<p>Yellow River Upper Reaches Continue to Rise for Days</p>
<p>Jinan Communication Since the beginning of summer, rainfall in Shandong Province has been less than in previous years, so the water levels of the Yellow River, the Grand Canal, and various rivers have not increased significantly. Since the 25th of this month, there has been a sudden heavy rain, which has lasted for two days. Moreover, the upper reaches of the Yellow River in Shaanxi Province have risen significantly. The water level of the Yellow River in Shandong Province has increased. The Grand Canal, which runs through the north of the Yellow River, has also risen abruptly by nine feet due to the surge in the Yellow River's water level. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Due to continuous cloudy and rainy days in Shandong Province and heavy rain in Shaanxi Province, the Yellow River has continued to rise. According to reports received today (27th) from the upper, middle, and lower reaches, the water continues to rise. The engineering situation is precarious, and all river workers in various sections have been mobilized to patrol day and night with strict precautions. The situation is becoming increasingly tense. As of today (27th), the water levels are: Guanzhuang in the upper reaches, 34.08 meters; Luokou in the middle reaches, a rise of 3.9 inches, reaching 28.8 meters; Xiezhiwan in the lower reaches, a rise of 4.7 inches, reaching 17.57 meters; Damajia, a rise of 3.5 inches, reaching 13.05 meters. The River Affairs Bureau received a report from Shaanxi Province this morning, stating that the Yellow River in Shaanxi Province had surged again yesterday, with the water level reaching 219.04 meters. It is expected that the Yellow River's water level in Shandong Province will continue to rise. Due to the continuous surge in the Yellow River's water level in northern Shandong, the Grand Canal suddenly rose nine feet yesterday (26th). The various sluice gates along the river are flowing backward, and some are at the same level as the canal, creating a dangerous situation. Yan Dengyou, a construction supervisor in Liaocheng County, reported to the Construction Department yesterday, stating, "Yesterday's rainfall was excessive, and the Grand Canal's water rose nine feet. The various sluice gates along the river, such as Baijiawa, Zhougong River, Sihetou, and Nanzhakou, are all flowing backward. The water in Zhougong River is at the same level as the canal. I am currently supervising the people to rush to protect it to prevent breaches. As of the time of dispatch, the rain has temporarily stopped. Sincerely, Yan Dengyou, Construction Supervisor of Liaocheng County."</p>
<p>After receiving the report of the Grand Canal's surge, the Construction Department immediately ordered the county chiefs and river workers along the river to personally go to the riverbank to strengthen precautions to avoid accidents. According to Kong Lingrong, Director of the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau, the surge in the northern Grand Canal has suddenly become tense. However, because the dikes along the river were built and completed before the rainy season, it is believed that there is no danger. After receiving the report, the Construction Department has ordered the counties along the Grand Canal to strengthen precautions.</p>
<p>There are more than 20 dangerous brick dams and ash dams on the Wei River in northern Shandong. The Construction Department has actively supervised the county government to rush to repair them day and night. As of now, they have been completely repaired. After receiving the report, the Construction Department appointed Zhou Li, a water conservancy technician, to go to Wucheng to inspect and accept them. Zhou set off from Jinan to Wucheng for inspection and acceptance on the 28th. (27th)</p>

<p>Wuhu Communication The Wuzha Railway built by the Jiangnan Railway Company, the first section from Wuhu to Wanlei Town, has been put into trial operation. From Wanlei to Xuancheng County, it is now also completely completed. This road is 140 miles long. In the past, the Xuanwu Automobile Company borrowed the old Ningxiang Railway roadbed to run long-distance buses, but the road was not paved with ballast, and it had to be suspended in rainy weather. Since the construction of the railway began, the bus has also stopped due to the same roadbed. The Jiangnan Company has completed the arrangement of the traffic equipment. Starting from the Wuhu Jiangbian Main Station, via Wuhu Dongmen Kazikou, Zhusigang, Miaojiazhuang, Wanzhi, Qiaotou Jiangjia, directly to Xuancheng, there are eight stations in total.

<p>Liu Xiang Strictly Prohibits Opium Planting</p>
<p>Areas Designated to Be Implemented from This Autumn</p>
<p>The Remaining Areas Will Be Prohibited Within Five Years According to the Central Plan</p>
<p>Chengdu Air Mail According to Liu Xiang, Director of the Sichuan Post-Disaster Relief, the Sichuan bandits have been gradually suppressed, and Sichuan politics are on track. In particular, the central government's six-year anti-smoking purpose and the five-year plan to ban smoking will be implemented. Starting this autumn, counties that have not been used to growing tobacco for a long time (ie, Liu's former southeastern Sichuan garrison area) will be strictly prohibited from planting tobacco. The remaining 80 counties will be divided into two phases and will be completely banned within five years. Ten regulations on banning smoking are formulated to achieve the purpose of eradicating smoking plants and saving the country. The prohibition area has been designated and announcements and regulations will be issued to each county for compliance. The record is as follows: Prohibition Announcement</p>
<p>"For announcement matters, the poison of opium has plagued our country for a long time. Until today, the poisonous plants are spreading more and more, the opium is collected, and the opium dens are all over the cities. From the gentry to the yamen servants, most of them are addicted to smoking, their energy is declining, their ambitions are falling, they are losing their vitality, and they are mocking friendly countries. In recent years, various provinces in North China have reproduced it into white noodles and red pills, and secretly transported and sold them, which is even more harmful. The poison is rampant, and there is no end to it. Now that strong neighbors are invading and the communist bandits are still growing, internal and external troubles are coming one after another, and the national situation is in danger, like a pile of eggs. If we do not cheer up at this time, we will see the country perish and there is no way to save it. For the sake of eradicating the smoke and saving the country, this director has made a five-year plan in accordance with the six-year ban on smoking issued by the central government. All counties that have not been used to growing tobacco for a long time will be strictly prohibited from planting tobacco seedlings, and regulations will be formulated to implement them in stages over the years to achieve the purpose of complete prohibition. This smoking ban plan is not only about saving the country, but should also start from now. In the implementation process, it is also of great importance to the rural economy and food supply. It is specially explained in four aspects so that everyone knows it. (1) Prohibition is beneficial to barrenness. Since the national protection war in our Sichuan, all the civilian grain has almost disappeared. The reason is that farmers in various places are competing to plant poppies to obtain surplus subjects, resulting in empty food. If the age is not good, the people's lives will have nothing to rely on. Therefore, it is strictly forbidden to plant, and ordered to change to miscellaneous grains to satisfy the people's food and prepare for barrenness. (2) Prohibition is beneficial to farmers and merchants. Farmers in various counties plant opium, producing too much and supplying more than demand. External transportation is a neighbor for the sake of good, the same sick country, and external soil resistance is often heard of folding and eating. Internal sales are more harmful to the people and spread more widely. Moreover, the local production is competing for sales, and the price is getting lower and lower. As a result, there is more inventory and the price of tobacco is low, and the sales are tired and the transportation is less. Farmers are trapped in the fields and merchants are tired on the road. Therefore, whether it is external transportation or internal sales, they all feel great pain. Implementing prohibition will eliminate the above two diseases, and farmers and merchants will benefit each other. (3) Prohibition is enough to strengthen the species. It is found that the smoking ban is lax, the goods are cheap, and people, regardless of poverty or wealth, are becoming more and more addicted. If only the transportation, sale, and absorption are strictly prohibited,</p>

<p>Illegally Stamping Seals to Swindle Money and Secretly Taking Bribes Exposed: Yao Zhilian’s Attempted Embezzlement, Huang Nanxi Charged with Two Crimes.</p>
<p>Yao Zhilian, a Wuxi native partnered with a hardware store at No. 417 Suzhou Road, reported to the French Concession Police last month on the 25th that Lin Changqia, the accountant of the store, instructed him to collect 355 yuan in silver from the Huacheng Canvas Factory on Yuezhou Road, along with a check from Ruichang Bank. Afterwards, the businessman rested at the residence of his mistress, Huang Zhiqing, at No. 14 Wenyuan Lane, Zhujia Bridge. Unexpectedly, Huang Zhiqing's elder brother, Huang Nanxi, claimed it was inconvenient to keep the check on him and offered to hold it temporarily. The businessman, believing him, handed over the check. When he asked for it back at 5 PM, Huang Nanxi claimed it had been stolen, but in reality, it was a conspiracy to defraud him. He requested an investigation. Detectives from the police station arrested the Huang siblings. Subsequent investigation revealed that Huang Zhiqing and Huang Nanxi were not true siblings, but had been lovers for four years. After Zhiqing became involved with Yao, the two Huangs relied on him for their livelihood. After Yao received the check, he conspired with Huang Nanxi at the Wenyishe Seal Engraving Shop on Zhonghua Road to illegally engrave a seal of "Dongtaifeng Company" and stamped it on the received check. The plaintiff and Huang Nanxi then went to Ruichang Bank on Tianjin Road to exchange it for a bank draft. On June 2nd, at 2 PM, the plaintiff handed the bank draft to Huang Nanxi at Huang Zhiqing's residence, and they subsequently divided the money among themselves. However, Wu Junfu, the owner of Yao Zhilian's hardware store, claimed that Yao Zhilian never handed over the money to the store, and Yao's father had already repaid the full amount, so he would not press charges. Under these circumstances, it was evident that the plaintiff also had conspired to embezzle. The accusations were entirely false. The police chief ordered that they all be detained and sent to the Second Special District Court. During the interrogation, Yao Zhilian claimed that although he went to engrave the seal with Huang Nanxi, the Huangs had taken the money. Huang Nanxi claimed the person had already returned the check and did not dare to misappropriate the funds, but the remaining testimony was evasive. Huang Zhiqing claimed she did not dare to take the money. After the debate concluded, the judge pronounced the verdict yesterday, sentencing Yao Zhilian to three months of imprisonment for attempted embezzlement of items held in his business capacity, Huang Nanxi to two months of imprisonment for joint forgery of a seal, and two months of imprisonment for intending to illegally misappropriate another person's property, to be served concurrently for three months. Huang Zhiqing was found not guilty.</p>
<p>The Second Special District Court Refuses to Accept Silver Coins and Copper Coins; Lawyers Association Sends Letter Requesting Attention</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association, based on reports from its members, stated that the case filing office of the Second Special District Court refused to accept silver coins and copper coins. A proposal was submitted requesting a letter be sent to the court president to address and rectify the issue. The association submitted this matter to the 173rd Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee, which resolved to send a letter to the president to address the situation, ordering rectification, and so on. The association has already sent a letter to the president of the Second Special District Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai, requesting that he promptly order the case filing office not to refuse silver coins and copper coins, to facilitate convenience and rectify the situation.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Plans to Improve Tram Facilities</p>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun," the Chinese side has long desired improvements to the tram and bus services in the International Settlement. The Public Works Department authorities, in addition to preliminary research by the Public Utilities Committee and the Transportation Committee, reportedly plan to convert the tram service into a public enterprise when the concession expires in 1940. They also plan to add elevated trams and double-decker trolley buses. The plan is currently under consideration, but due to the prevalence of rickshaws on the streets, trams and buses cannot operate at high speeds. Unless the streets are widened, it may be difficult to resolve the issue quickly. Furthermore, coordination of connecting lines with the Chinese-controlled areas is also being planned.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Requests Investigation into Copper Mountain Livestock Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce wired Jiangsu Province’s Finance Department yesterday, stating that the Copper Mountain County government is violating the province's regulations that, as inspection fees had already been levied on butchered cattle, no additional taxes should be levied. It has created a so-called "livestock tax," levying 2% on merchants purchasing butchered cattle. The Chamber of Commerce sent a letter requesting the tax be abolished but has not received a reply. On July 24th, it sent a letter to your department requesting investigation and prohibition of the tax. On July 27th, the Copper Mountain County government replied, stating that the livestock tax is used to subsidize local education and has been approved. The Chamber of Commerce stated that on June 27th, when inquiring about this matter, it specifically asked whether business tax and local public welfare donations such as the livestock tax should still be levied in addition to inspection fees. The Finance Department replied on July 7th that those who have already paid inspection fees should not be subject to any additional taxes, which should apply to governments at all levels. The county's claim that the tax has been approved is uncertain. However, if the approved original case contradicts the Finance Department's regulations, the former order should be revoked, which is a normal administrative procedure. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce has attached five donation tickets and requests the Finance Department to investigate the matter. If the county government's claim is true, then the previously approved case should be revoked, and the tax collection should be stopped to avoid redundant and excessive levies. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits this matter, hoping for your consideration.</p>

<p>Husband Sentenced to Three Months for Assaulting Wife</p>
<p>Zhou Mao Da Stabs Wife with Knife</p>
<p>Zhou Mao Da, a local resident of Pingfang, Hejian Road, has been unemployed recently, leading to severe financial difficulties. He married a woman named Lou from Nanjing and has an 11-year-old child named Shi Bao. On the 16th of this month, at 10:15 AM, the child picked up a piece of rotten watermelon in front of the door. Zhou used a knife to cut off the dirty parts and gave it to the child to eat. Lou was furious upon seeing this and began to scold him harshly. Zhou, out of anger, stabbed Lou in the lower right breast with the watermelon knife. Lou collapsed to the ground in pain. The police arrived after being alerted by patrolling officers and arrested Zhou. The injured Lou was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Zhou Mao Da was sent to the First Special District Court the following morning. It was ordered that the matter be further investigated after Lou's injuries healed. Recently, Judge Liu Yugui held a continued hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Lou, whose injuries had somewhat improved, stated that she was doing laundry at home when the defendant tried to take her clothes to pawn for money, which led to the argument. He then stabbed her with the knife, intending to harm her life, and not because of the child eating the watermelon. The doctor said her injuries were not life-threatening. The defendant's statements were evasive. Judge Liu sentenced Zhou Mao Da to three months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>Zou Deliang, Foreman of Xiangtai Timber Company, Accused of Embezzlement</p>
<p>Debate Concluded, Date Set for Verdict</p>
<p>British-owned Xiangtai Timber Company is a major player in the Shanghai timber industry with a thriving business. The company employs over a hundred timber workers, managed by foreman Zou Deliang. All accounts, as well as wage distribution, are handled by the foreman. Recently, workers at the company claimed that there were discrepancies in the accounts handled by the foreman, suspecting embezzlement. The workers jointly filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, which ordered Zou Deliang to provide the account books for auditing. The audit revealed numerous discrepancies. To further investigate the matter, the workers jointly petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs and the First Special District Court to thoroughly investigate the account books from the previous four years. The Bureau of Social Affairs sent a letter to the court requesting investigation.</p>
<p>The First Special Court approved the petition, and Judge Peng presided over the hearing at 8 AM on the morning before. The plaintiffs, led by Ni A’ao, along with their attorney, Zhang Juan Sheng, arrived on time. The defendant, Zou Deliang, and the company's accountant, Lin Xiao Yu, did not appear in court, only attorney Xu Zuo Liang appeared as a proxy. After Judge Peng began, he ordered the interrogation of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's service member Lin Peng and others for theft.</p>
<p>The Case Involves 1050 Silver Dollars Missing</p>
<p>Lin Peng, a service member of the Supervisory Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau (a 27-year-old Fujian native), reported on April 7th of this year, based on information from informant Zhu Qinggen, that Xi Futang, the head of the security team residing in Chenjia Men, Pudong, was operating a counterfeit money operation. Lin reported this to his superiors and led police officers Yu Yongxin, Ji Sigong, Li Jinbang, Li Genyi, Zhao Yushan, Gao Zhi, Jiang Bin, Dong Yukun, and others to Xi Futang's home for a search. The search yielded nothing. Afterwards, Xi Futang discovered that 1050 silver dollars were missing (both five-dollar and ten-dollar bills), along with a gold watch, a gold chain, and two gold rings. He reported this to the local regiment headquarters, which reported it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. After receiving the report, Bureau Chief Wen believed that Lin Peng and others were suspected of theft. Except for Gao Zhi, who was on the run and not captured, Lin Peng and police officers Yu Yongxin, Ji Sigong, Li Genyi, Li Jinbang, Zhao Yushan, and informant Zhu Qinggen were arrested and sent to the Procuratorate of the District Court for investigation. They were prosecuted in the Criminal Court after a clear investigation. The matter had been repeatedly investigated but remained unresolved. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Peiming held a continued hearing. The plaintiff, Xi Futang, requested to file a private lawsuit, ordering the defendants to return the items. Lin Peng claimed that when they searched the plaintiff's home, the responsible police officer from the Public Security Bureau was also present. As a result, they found counterfeit money, and the bureau chief gave him a major demerit for making a false report. Furthermore, after the search, he publicly asked the plaintiff and Officer Jiang if anything was missing, and the plaintiff stated that nothing was missing. Afterwards, he suddenly accused them of stealing silver dollars, which was clearly a fabricated accusation. As a public servant, his reputation was his second life, and he could not arbitrarily steal people's property. He asked the court to conduct a detailed investigation. If it were true, he would be willing to face legal consequences, even execution. Zhu Qinggen and others denied the accusations. The interrogating official then asked the prosecutor to present their opinion. Finally, attorneys E Sen and Zhan Jifeng, hired by the defendants, made their arguments. The official ordered the case to be concluded and set a date for the verdict. The defendants were sent back into custody. After examining the details of the case, the plaintiff's attorney, Zhang Juan Sheng, submitted a list of items confiscated by the defendants and a report from the former auditor, proving that the defendants still had various account books. He requested the judge to order them to be brought in for review. Judge Peng then ordered the attorneys from both sides to begin their arguments and immediately announced the end of the hearing, setting the verdict for 8 AM on August 6th. (Dagong News Agency)</p>
<p>Recent News from the China Correspondence Accountancy School</p>
<p>Many Applicants for the Summer Course</p>
<p>The China Correspondence Accountancy School at 275 Gordon Road, run by accountant Shen Liren, has been established for eight years. It has cultivated thirty accounting talents, gaining a widespread reputation in society. This year, during the summer break, the school received a large number of new students, especially assistant teachers and students from various universities outside Shanghai. Universities such as Soochow, Xiamen, Lingnan, Zhijiang, and Wuhan, as well as universities in Shanghai such as Shanghai, Guanghua, Fudan, and Datong, all had assistant teachers or students reporting to the school for supplementary study. Therefore, although the school is nominally a supplementary school, its substance is no less than an accounting knowledge research institute. Furthermore, since the school began enrolling students for the new face-to-face evening school from the next semester, the number of applicants has been extremely high, with many transferring from other schools. It is reported that the school, due to its location, may not be able to accommodate all applicants and will stop enrolling students at a certain time.</p>

<p>Boarding House Owner Accused of Raping Factory Girl</p>
<p>Defendant Denies Immoral Conduct</p>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for This Case</p>
<p>Meng Yongquan, a native of Taizhou, along with his 18-year-old niece, Meng Kougu, accused Luan Guangyu, a fellow villager who runs a boarding house at the Xihe Yarn Factory in Caojiadu, West Shanghai, of rape and causing injury. Prosecutor Xie Lian of the District Court investigated the matter, ordered the defendant to be questioned and detained, and had a forensic doctor examine Meng Kougu, who confirmed that she had not fully developed and that her hymen had been ruptured. He then cited Article 240, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law to prosecute Luan Guangyu. Judge Guan Liting held a hearing the day before yesterday, ordering Luan Guangyu, who was in custody, to be brought before the court. Luan Guangyu, 32 years old, a native of Taizhou, and a boarding house owner, testified that Meng Kougu owed him more than 80 yuan in boarding fees. He was running a small business and could no longer afford to subsidize her. He repeatedly demanded payment but was met with accusations. Meng Yongquan incited her to falsely accuse him of rape. Meng Kougu testified that she was 18 years old. One morning in May, at around 6 AM, she stopped working due to foot pain and was resting at home. Luan Guangyu broke into her bedroom, pushed her onto the bed, and raped her, covering her mouth to prevent her from screaming. Afterwards, he monitored her movements and prohibited her from going out. She was violated twice more in the following ten days. Meng Yongquan testified that he was 44 years old, a native of Taizhou, and worked as a gatekeeper on Robison Road. On July 3rd, his niece, Kougu, came to him crying, telling him that Luan Guangyu had raped her twice. His niece was young and suffered a serious violation, which greatly affected her future health. He requested a severe punishment. At this point, the judge asked Prosecutor Xie to present his opinion. Finally, attorney Sun Ba Wu, hired by the defendant, defended the defendant. The judge considered the case concluded and set a date for the verdict. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement: A Review of Japanese Aquatic Product Dumping by Ruo Qian</p>
<p>Food has a close relationship with mankind; as the old saying goes, "People can go without goods for a hundred years, but not without food for a single day." Moreover, according to recent analyses, food consumption typically accounts for 40% of an average person's total consumption. Aquatic products, in turn, constitute a quarter of the food component. Therefore, the aquatic industry that produces aquatic products is naturally worthy of attention. Our country has a population of over 400 million, and the vastness of the demand cannot be ignored. Moreover, the fact is that more than a million of our compatriots rely directly on the aquatic industry for their livelihoods!</p>
<p>However, what is the state of our country's aquatic industry today? Newspapers have long reported on rampant piracy, bankrupt fishing villages, and the collapse of the entire aquatic industry. What is even more distressing and alarming is the flooding of our markets with foreign aquatic products, especially the massive dumping of Japanese aquatic products. At a minimum, aquatic products worth several million dollars are consumed by our people each year, which means that several million dollars flow out of our people's hands each year, weakening the economic foundation of the masses and increasing Japan's capital for aggression. As for the livelihoods of our millions of fishermen, they are directly devastated to the point where they have no place to stand. This article briefly discusses the methods and import figures of Japanese aquatic product dumping (for a clearer understanding, readers can refer to my article "Observing the Economic Power of Various Countries in China from the Perspective of Fisheries," published in the "China Economic" monthly, Volume 2, Issue 5, by the Chinese Economic Research Association, which provides a more detailed account). Here, we can only examine why Japanese aquatic products are dumped in our country and how we can resist them.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Japanese aquatic products are dumped in our country to an extreme degree, but how did this trend come about? There are indeed many reasons. But to summarize, it is because of the low domestic prices in Japan, and to maintain market prices, they have to dump goods abroad; this is the so-called "weak" dumping. Secondly, it is because Japan has the ambition to invade our entire aquatic industry, seeking to undermine the revival of our country's aquatic industry through dumping; this is the so-called "strong" dumping. Now, let's analyze it in detail:</p>
<p>First, it is naturally due to the overproduction within Japan itself. In recent years, Japan's aquatic industry has developed rapidly, with production far exceeding its consumption capacity. In the last five years (1928-1932), Japan's average national total output value of aquatic products was 450 million yuan, and last year it even reached 500 million yuan. Therefore, fish like the "Eastern Salted Fish" (i.e., salmon, scientifically known as Salmonidae) that are shipped to China, even if their prices drop to extremely low levels in Japan, no one wants to buy them. In areas producing salmon in Hokkaido, they are so abundant that they are worthless, but their fishermen cannot barter in this era. Therefore, to maintain their livelihoods, they have to sell them, which led to this path of dumping abroad.</p>
<p>Second, Japan's aquatic manufacturing industry has developed exceptionally in recent years. Their fishmeal manufacturing industry has only been around for a few years, but it has seen rapid development. Taking exports alone: in 1931, the export quantity was 19,112 tons, valued at 2,329,010 yuan; while last year, it jumped to 48,177 tons, valued at 4,336,016 yuan. In addition, the total production of various canned aquatic products last year was 3,215,182 boxes, valued at 56,094,841 yuan. With such large-scale production, the result is that they inevitably have to dump goods abroad, especially since domestic prices are low due to overproduction. For example, a half-pound round canned pomfret only sells for a dime a can in the consumer market, which naturally promotes the trend of dumping abroad. Professor Clark of Columbia University in the United States has provided a sufficient explanation for this trend. He said that due to the large amount of fixed capital under large-scale production, it is necessary to produce as much as possible. However, if the country cannot accept this huge supply, they can only bear a small percentage of the fixed capital with the quantity exceeding domestic needs and dump it abroad. In this way, they can absorb some of the foreign financial resources, maintain domestic commodity prices, and reduce that percentage of fixed capital. Therefore, the phenomenon of dumping is an inevitable result of large-scale production. Now that Japan's aquatic manufacturing industry is developing in this direction day by day, it is naturally promoting the trend of dumping abroad.</p>
<p>Third, why do they dump in China? It can be determined without thinking that it is due to the relationship between China and Japan. The Chinese and Japanese nations are relatively close, so their products can mostly suit the tastes of the Chinese people. And the collapse of China's economic sector is becoming increasingly serious, especially the instability of the aquatic economy, with the aquatic market largely becoming a market for international aquatic products to compete for. Japan, due to its geographical proximity and low transportation and other costs, has more factors that contribute to Japanese dumping. Moreover, China lacks political and military protection, so the Japanese can easily dump goods in our country.</p>
<p>Fourth, it is for the purpose of expanding the market. We all know that Japanese aquatic products have a great influence in Chinese commercial ports. However, the situation in commercial ports has also been declining in recent years, and they have to find a way out to the inland areas of our country. However, the bankruptcy of China's rural economy in recent years has weakened the purchasing power of inland residents. Since Japanese aquatic products seek to develop in the inland areas, they use the method of dumping to make aquatic products sell well with lower prices. Moreover, the trend of the Japanese aquatic industry is to trade in markets with low prices, which is easy to permanently manipulate the market, so they implement the situation of dumping to foreign countries.</p>
<p>Fifth, it is for the purpose of excluding competitors. Due to its geographical convenience, Japan's trade with China has been exceptionally developed. However, since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese people have at least had a considerable awareness of being wary of buying Japanese goods. At the same time, other imperialists are taking this opportunity to try their best to promote their goods to our country. Everyone is keenly competing to monopolize the market. For example, the U.S. aquatic authorities are paying close attention to investigating the situation of our country's fishery; the transportation of aquatic products in ports such as Shanghai: the quantity and value of aquatic consumption; and the supply and demand of all aspects: all are detailed investigations. And canned aquatic products are often shipped to be sold cheaply. Recently, American canned salmon is easily found in Shanghai. Furthermore, salted blueback herring from the UK and Canada originally sold very well in China; but since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Russian salted salmon has also been sold at reduced prices, and the quantity imported each time is so large that it can sometimes monopolize the needs of the market. For example, the Huashun cargo ship imported 54,663 boxes, valued at more than 300,000 yuan, on September 16th last year. With various countries competing to seize our country's aquatic market, Japan, in order to maintain its original position, has to find ways to drive out its competitors, thus promoting its ambition to actively dump goods as much as possible.</p>
<p>Sixth, it is due to the world economic panic and tariff policies. After the European War, as a result, various countries felt internal exhaustion and had to develop their domestic industries; in addition, the economic recession in recent years is becoming increasingly severe; therefore, it is necessary to prevent the intrusion of foreign competitive products. For example, the United States is a country that developed by relying on the European War, but it is currently experiencing an economic panic; and the increase in the import of foreign aquatic products (such as Japanese canned crab, canned tuna, and frozen halibut are mostly shipped in large quantities) and the decline in its own exports, in order to prevent the surplus of domestic aquatic products and the sluggish economy, they have to seek high taxes on foreign imports. Recently, since the Blue Eagle movement, they have paid close attention to the aquatic industry. President Roosevelt immediately announced the increase in import tariffs on canned aquatic products such as cod and sardines. At the same time, the national fishing industry vigorously declared: "It is hoped that the U.S. President can immediately provide relief to domestic industries that are in danger and implement the prohibition or restriction of foreign goods." As a result, Japanese aquatic products are the first to bear the brunt. In addition, countries such as the United Kingdom, which have always been traditional free traders, have levied a tax rate of 10% on the import of food products since 1931 due to the cooperation of the Labour Party and the Conservative Party. France has also imposed restrictions on the import of Japanese canned crab. According to the proposal in the French Parliament, only 70% of the actual import quantity of the previous November is allowed to be imported freely. Among the 10,500 boxes imported from Japan last year, only a quarter can be imported freely, and the other three-quarters must be exchanged for French products. The Japanese aquatic products have encountered walls everywhere, and in order to seek their own way out, they have no choice but to dump goods as much as possible.</p>
<p>Seventh, it is to prevent the revival of China's aquatic industry. We should pay absolute attention to this point. Although our country cannot be said to have made any major progress in the aquatic industry in recent years in fact, it has indeed received more attention than in the past. At the very least, the government is trying to plan some fisheries construction work; at the same time, some entrepreneurs have become interested in this and are proceeding with new types of fishing, which is indeed a trend, and considerable results will definitely be obtained soon. It is believed that under today's circumstances, if there is no hindrance, fishing villages can be stable, production can be abundant, and production, sales, and transportation can all develop smoothly. Is that acceptable to the ambitious Japanese fishing industry? Therefore, while we are still in the initial stages, they dump their aquatic products at reduced prices, so that our country's fishery products cannot compete with them and have no possibility of being sold in the market. In this way, wouldn't our fishermen have no way to maintain their livelihoods? Wouldn't the fishing industry also be fundamentally bankrupt? This is the biggest reason why the Japanese aquatic industry must dump goods in our country.</p>
<p>The above seven points can be said to have determined that Japanese aquatic products have to be dumped abroad, and even more have to be dumped in China. There are automatic relationships and passive relationships in the middle, so there is such a grand state of dumping. Although there have already been tens of millions of yuan in exploitation, in the future, as the above problems gradually become more serious, there will be even larger-scale dumping: the extent of which is undoubtedly certain to be far greater than today.</p>
<p>The most severely affected result of the dumping of Japanese aquatic products is naturally the Chinese aquatic industry, which has a direct relationship. The low prices of Japanese aquatic products mean that they can not only sell well in commercial ports, but also flood the markets in the inland areas and the original distribution centers of the fishing industry. Not to mention anything else, even Jiangyin, which is known as one of the four major old-fashioned fishing industry centers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, has been filled with Japanese goods in recent years, with annual transactions of 100,000 yuan, causing fish prices to be chaotic and the market to be depressed, and forcing our country's fishermen to sell their production obtained through sweat and blood at reduced prices, resulting in losses. If they are wealthy fishermen, they are more willing to change careers, which can lead to the sudden decline of the fishing industry; but the fishermen of our country's old fishing industry mostly borrow money for their business capital. Their hope for work lies in the end of the fishing season, and their greatest hope is to be able to have enough food and clothing for the year after repaying their debts, and also to obtain capital for fishing next year. Now, the dumping of domestic and foreign goods means that the value of production cannot offset the amount of loans. How can we expect them to engage in fishing with peace of mind? Improvement is naturally out of the question. What can be seen is only the total collapse of the fishing industry?</p>
<p>Let's talk about it on a smaller scale. The Japanese aquatic products that are dumped are mainly dried fish, which makes the old aquatic manufacturing industry (which is also the most important sideline of fishermen) feel endless pain. For example, Daishan in the outer sea of Zhejiang Province is fortunately a famous producing area of ​​yellow croaker dried fish. Millions of yellow croaker production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, except for fresh food, are transported there for manufacturing. There are more than 100 large and small dried fish factories in the area. Their sales channels, in addition to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, such as Guangdong, Fujian, Hubei, Jiangxi, etc., can mostly sell well. However, the situation has not been the case in recent years. When the author went to investigate last year, everyone was complaining. Their scope has been getting smaller year by year, and there has been no improvement in business. Although their manufacturing methods and business methods have many inherent shortcomings, the fact that their products cannot be sold at good prices is an important reason. For example, the cost of yellow croaker dried fish, from the purchase price of fresh fish, salt tax, and the cost of land rent, labor wages, etc. for salting, drying, and packaging, etc., is about 10 yuan per 100 catties. Adding transportation costs, it will naturally exceed 10 yuan when it reaches the market. However, Japanese salted fish only costs 7 yuan per 100 catties at the lowest time. Moreover, when salted fish merchants sell domestic and Japanese products, they also make more profits by selling Japanese products. Therefore, Japanese products are more prevalent than domestic products on the market. In addition, the public's purchasing power is weak, so they abandon domestic products and tend to buy Japanese products. This is also why the old aquatic manufacturing industry is bankrupt. Isn't this affected by the dumping of Japanese aquatic products?</p>
<p>If it is said more seriously, then the weakening of civil purchasing power in recent years cannot but be said to be a factor that has promoted this phenomenon. Japanese aquatic products are dumped in the market at low prices. The general public, on the one hand, buys and eats them because they don't know they are Japanese goods, but the actual reduction in consumer value means that everyone likes to be greedy for cheap, not to mention that there are unscrupulous merchants who deceive them in the middle. This kind of leakage also reaches 10 million yuan every year, doesn't it further increase their capital for aggression? Isn't the economic foundation of our Chinese people being absorbed and destroyed by it? The gradual weakening of purchasing power over the years is because this production capital flows abroad. Aquatic products are necessary consumption for people's food, isn't there a greater impact? Ah, it's really unimaginable! In short, this affects our entire nation, and we don't want to take more examples. What we hope is to work hard to eliminate this danger: the situation is as urgent as burning eyebrows, and no one wants to see it develop and grow!</p>
<p>How can we resist this? Are we going to sit and wait for death? No, I dare to say no, our modern people are people who want the revival of the country and the nation. So, how can we find a way to resist it? Relief still cannot get rid of the tariff issue. We believe that when drafting tax regulations, we should conduct individual research on various imported aquatic products: what is the production situation of a certain aquatic product in China? What is the market demand? What about the domestic transportation and sales? What is the situation of foreign imports? What is the degree of infringement? What is the direct impact? What domestic products can be used to replace them after resistance? If answers can be obtained for all these questions, then we will feel that the tax rate set has a considerable effect. Otherwise, a light tax rate is set for important imports, which are also the largest consumption in the market; and a very high tax rate is increased for insignificant goods, and in fact, I am afraid that actual effectiveness cannot be achieved. It seems that the recent amendment to the tax rate has reduced the import tax rate on shark fins, which seems to have made this mistake. Therefore, we believe that increasing the tax rate should also undergo a solid investigation, statistics, and research work. Otherwise, the country's aquatic products will be completely defeated and never recovered. Aquatic products occupy an important position in tariff issues, but this article cannot discuss it in detail due to space limitations.</p>
<p>As for the fundamental treatment, it cannot be achieved by empty words. If we do not reorganize and develop our country's aquatic industry, there is still no way to resist it fundamentally. For example, if the import of Japanese aquatic products is rejected, what aquatic products can be used to replace them domestically? It is difficult to have a satisfactory answer. Recently, the reason why Japanese aquatic products are flooding the market is partly because the domestic aquatic products cannot meet the needs of the market, which has led to so many unscrupulous merchants who are blinded by profit. As for how to reorganize and develop the country's aquatic industry, domestic aquatic experts have long had detailed and extensive plans, great insights, scattered in various newspapers and magazines. The author does not want to show more opinions. The following are outlines of what is urgently needed:</p>
<p>(1) In order to develop aquatic resources, we must first investigate the ocean conditions and open up fishing grounds:</p>
<p>(2) In order to smooth the sales channels of aquatic products, we must first establish fish market management and distribution;</p>
<p>(3) In order to facilitate aquatic economic financing, we must first organize fisheries banks to provide low-interest loans;</p>
<p>(4) In order to increase fishery catches, we must first mechanize fishing boats and scientize fishing gear;</p>
<p>(5) In order to rationally develop aquatic products, we must first reorganize the original fisheries organization to organize various fisheries cooperatives;</p>
<p>(6) In order to ensure the safety of the outer seas, we must first pay attention to suppressing pirates, organize fishermen's self-defense groups, and at the same time find ways to stabilize fishing villages;</p>
<p>(7) In order to improve the knowledge of fishermen, we must first organize fishermen's elementary schools (the author believes that the current aquatic education has fundamentally wrong places, and we should pay attention to practical fishermen's education, which will be discussed in detail in another article).</p>
<p>In addition, what we should pay the most attention to is the issue of national aquatic industry control. This issue has already been discussed in this journal. Although there are still many opinions, this article can only be hastily concluded.</p>
<h3>The American Tariff Policy in the Blue Eagle Movement by Tan Bingwen</h3>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from the 12th of this month states: "The Reciprocal Tariff Act was signed today; this act authorizes the President to negotiate treaties with foreign countries and increase or decrease existing tariffs by up to 50%."</p>
<p>The new tariff policy was originally proposed by Secretary of State Hull (Cordell Hull, Secretary of State). It was passed in the House of Representatives on the 9th with 314 votes to 111, and was subsequently agreed to by the Senate. It was then officially enacted into law on June 12th with the President's signature. Therefore, it is also known as the Hull Tariff Act. Since the promulgation of this bill, the spirit of the Blue Eagle Movement has begun to be expressed in American industry policies, and its importance is self-evident.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's consideration of reforming American tariff policy has been around for a long time. Since his inauguration, he has had this intention. The idea was first revealed at the London World Economic Conference, but due to the lack of sincerity among the countries at the time, nothing was achieved. However, the necessity of revising tariffs has been highlighted. Five months later, the Pan-American Conference was convened in Montevideo and accepted the principle of reciprocal treaty negotiations. Since the stabilization of the U.S. dollar value on January 31st of this year, the conclusion of such treaties has been further promoted. Following this, on February 13th, The Export-Import Bank was established in Washington, D.C., specializing in trade with Russia. Subsequently, two banks of similar nature were established one after another, one specifically for trade with Cuba, and the other for trade with other countries. The authorization of the President to revise tariffs and freely sign treaties has now laid the foundation for the new trade policy of the United States.</p>
<p>2. The Evolution of American Tariff Policy</p>
<p>Before examining this new tariff policy, we should briefly mention the evolution of American tariff policy; the emergence of all social phenomena must have historical factors.</p>
<p>It is well known that the United States is a typical country with high protectionist tariffs. Since the colonial era, the United States has suffered from a lack of capital and had to borrow large amounts of funds from European countries to develop its abundant resources. However, borrowing requires repayment of principal and interest, so it had to implement protectionist tariffs to seek trade surplus and to compensate. After the War of Independence, domestic industries gradually developed, and in order to avoid competition with advanced capitalist countries, the spirit of protectionist tariffs became more and more solid. In this century, this traditional policy has not been abandoned, but the methods of taxation have become more complex. For example, the Republican Party's Payne-Aldrich Tariff of 1907, under the guise of "equalizing the difference between domestic and foreign production costs," raised the average ad valorem tariff rate to 40.73%. The Democratic Party's Underwood Tariff of 1912, under the principle of "competitive tariffs," reduced the tariff rate to 26.97%. In 1922, the so-called "flexible tariff" and "scientific tariff" (Republican Party) were implemented, raising it to 38.2%. The Hawley-Smoot Tariff of 1930 (Republican Party) further raised it to 41.64%. The recently promulgated Hull Tariff is nothing more than a reaction to this tariff policy, so let us discuss it quietly.</p>
<p>The Hawley-Smoot Tariff was the tariff policy adopted by the United States during the world economic panic. This law increased or newly established tariffs on 887 items, while reductions and exemptions were only granted to 336 items. Its purpose was to: 1. Increase national employment, strengthen the control of foreign trade, and encourage the development of national industries. 2. Follow President Hoover's declaration of implementing the law. However, this law was met with strong opposition from people at home and abroad during the deliberation stage. The most powerful opponents in the domestic industrial sector were people like automobile tycoon Henry Ford, because the law increased the tariff rates on 750 kinds of automobile raw materials. On May 5, 1930, 1,028 economists from domestic universities jointly submitted a protest letter to Congress, stating that the tariff was not in line with the times. At the same time, more than 30 countries with frequent trade with the United States also lodged protests. However, the government was ignorant of the matter and insisted on going its own way. It was finally passed by Congress on June 17, 1930, and implemented the next day. As a result, all countries have sought retaliation: for example, Canada increased the tariff rates on 12 kinds of American imports, and France also increased the import tax on automobiles and their parts. Other countries such as Italy, Spain, Mexico, Cuba, and Australia have also sought retaliatory measures one after another. Within a year, as many as 25 countries implemented retaliatory high tariff policies against the United States. The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act was nothing less than the fuse of a world trade war. Since then, the intensity of the world trade war has been unprecedented.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff, it not only caused the intensification of trade wars between countries, but also had adverse effects on its domestic economy. Phenomena such as the decline in trade, the sharp drop in stock prices, the freezing of bank funds, and the daily increase in the number of unemployed workers followed one after another, accelerating the pace of the domestic economic panic. People of insight in the country were heartbroken and unanimously advocated revising the tariff law. The most prominent of these was a joint letter submitted to President Hoover in October 1932 by 180 economists from 36 domestic universities and colleges, explaining the pros and cons and requesting amendments to the tariffs. Although it was later resolved by both houses of Congress, it was rejected and unsigned by President Hoover, and it never took effect. Later, the Democratic Party won the election and began to implement a reform plan. At the end of last year, Secretary of State Hull proposed his specific policy for discussion by Congress. After much deliberation, it was finally implemented in mid-June of this year.</p>
<p>3. The Decline of World Trade and the Sluggishness of American Export Trade</p>
<p>Since 1929, world trade has declined sharply. In terms of total imports, it decreased from $35,606,000,000 in 1925 to $11,537,000,000 in 1933. (Note 1) According to a conservative estimate, if world trade had proceeded at the pre-war rate, it should have been $50 billion last year, which is $38 billion U.S. dollars more than the actual figure. (Note 2) The decrease of $38 billion in international trade has resulted in a corresponding decrease in world production of $38 billion, which also means a decrease in the same amount of consumption and further reduces the living standards of the people. The United States is a part of the world economy and a country with developed international trade, so it has been greatly affected. Therefore, the U.S. commercial index during the same period (comparing 1929 with 1933) fell from 112.9 to 63. National income also decreased from $83,037,000,000 to $38,490,000,000. What is especially worth our attention is the decline in U.S. export trade. (Note 3)</p>

<p>| Total Imports       | -             | 4,297        | -             | 1,449        | -67           |             |</p>
<p>(Explanation) The units for the quantities of each commodity are as follows: automobiles in thousands, cotton products in millions of square yards, typewriters in thousands, copper, cotton, lard, and tobacco in millions of pounds, gasoline, lubricating oil, and resin in thousands of barrels, and wheat and flour in millions of bushels.</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, it is clear that export trade has declined significantly in terms of both quantity and value. The rate of decline reaches 80% to 90% in many cases. The above only refers to several major commodities. Looking at the total trade volume, the trend of decline is no less severe. Exports in 1929 were $5,240,995,000, and imports were $4,399,361,000, with a surplus of $841,634,000. In 1933, exports were $1,482,764,000, and imports were $1,315,497,000, with a surplus of only $167,267,000. The amount of the decline is unprecedented since the Civil War. (Note 4)</p>
<p>Although the income from U.S. international trade only accounts for one-tenth of the total national income of the United States, its impact on the national economy and people's livelihood of the United States is extremely significant, especially in the agricultural sector. Why? Because U.S. agricultural products and raw materials are mostly exported overseas. Among the most prominent: the United States exports about half of its cotton, one-third of its tobacco, one-fifth of its wheat, half of its lard, and one-quarter of its rice... Moreover, the goods listed in the above table, except for cotton products and automobiles, account for an average of more than 5% of domestic production each year. (Note 5) When these goods cannot be sold overseas, they will become a glut in the domestic market, with no other use than to allow them to rot in warehouses. If this phenomenon continues to exist, by the end of this year, the area of farmland in the United States that is forced to stop planting will reach 40 million to 100 million acres. Farmers have lost the ability to purchase industrial products and must find jobs in the manufacturing sector. The impact on the manufacturing industry is self-evident. Therefore, James Farrell, the former manager of U.S. Steel Corporation, once said: "More than 7 million people in the United States rely on foreign trade for a living. When the number of unemployed people in the United States is currently 14 million, half of them are unemployed due to sluggish trade." (Note 6) How true these words are!</p>
<p>4. The Hull Tariff and Its Contents</p>
<p>Hull attributed the decline of world trade to the prevalence of "Economic Annihilation" between countries around the world; and attributed the sluggishness of American trade to the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act. And in the final analysis, the Hawley-Smoot Tariff was the chief culprit. As mentioned above, the world trade war has intensified since the transformation of the American tariff policy. Therefore, in order to restore world trade and revitalize American trade, the United States should also lead the way. A call to the heights will have a significant effect.</p>
<p>In Hull's proposal, the opening statement states: "There are currently about 30 million unemployed workers in the world. This huge population has not been able to find work since 1929. Those who have frozen to death or starved to death have lost their purchasing power. Therefore, the market has lost a large number of customers." He continued, "In addition, the poor who are below the starvation line account for 80% of the world's total population. These people urgently need the promotion of world trade, especially American trade, because the United States produces large amounts of agricultural products and raw materials, which are necessary for developing countries; and also produces huge quantities of production goods for them to establish their industrialization. If all countries in the world still do not abandon the policy of "Economic Annihilation," it will only accelerate the collapse of the world economic structure. In order to restore world trade, the United States should be the vanguard, establishing reciprocal tariffs to unleash its excess production capacity."</p>
<p>Hull's theory is simple and unremarkable. Its extraordinary feature lies in the means of its implementation. Here is a brief description:</p>
<p>(1) Grant the President the power to freely sign reciprocal treaties without the need for congressional approval. In the past, the United States had to go through discussion in both houses of Congress to conclude treaties, which took a lot of time and was no longer applicable to the United States in this extraordinary period. Moreover, in most countries around the world, treaties are signed without congressional approval. Those that absolutely do not require congressional review include Canada and British India. Hungary only needs to send a written notice to Congress. The United Kingdom adopts a publication law, with a time limit of 28 days, after which Members of Parliament may not object. Other countries such as Italy and Germany under fascist rule, and Russia under communist dictatorship are even more irrelevant. However, this is slightly in conflict with U.S. federal law, but it was ultimately passed due to the general trend of various countries. However, the President's exercise of this power is for a period of three years, and the effective period of the treaty shall not exceed three years.</p>
<p>(2) Freely revise tariffs, up to 50% (whether on the import side or the export side). However, this is only a provision in principle, and there are two special measures (i.e., items (3) and (4) listed below), which are even more significant in their meaning.</p>
<p>(3) For those that are not produced in the United States but are necessary for the people, they shall be exempt from tax, but only in exchange for tax exemption on special commodities in the country. Such as Japanese raw silk, French champagne and brandy, Brazilian coffee, Indian tea, Javanese rubber, etc. If Japan is willing to exempt the import of U.S. cotton as a condition, the United States can also exempt the import tax on Japanese raw silk. If the tax on Javanese rubber is exempted, it should be obtained in exchange for the tax exemption on mechanical imports... The rest can be deduced by analogy. For other commodities such as handmade lace, silk fabrics, leather goods, oriental carpets (China), palm oil (Italy), camphor (Japan), mirrors, dried fish (Russia), almonds (Spain), beads (Czech Republic), sunflower seed oil (Netherlands), Christmas decorations (Germany)... etc., because they are rarely produced or not produced in the United States, they will also be given the lowest tax rate or tax exemption.</p>
<p>(4) For those that compete with domestic commodities, taxes may be increased as much as possible, or even prohibited from import. Tobacco products, cottonseed, fire bricks, automobiles and parts, locomotives, safety razors, leather, machinery, zinc, steel, cotton cloth, pigments, livestock, cement, granite, lead sheets, batteries, flour, canned goods, etc. are all in this category.</p>
<p>The above four points are the most prominent. For the rest, please refer to them yourself. (Note 7)</p>
<p>5. Conclusion</p>
<p>According to Hull's argument, the new tariff law is indeed a means of reviving world trade. However, after examining its implementation methods in detail, we know that its policy is no different from the past. In terms of the first item, the United States has already signed most-favored-nation treaties with 48 countries. The effect of this bill is at most to re-express these most-favored-nation treaties in another form.</p>
<p>Moreover, this bill intends to reduce or exempt taxes on those that are not produced or are sparsely produced in the country, and to heavily tax or even prohibit imports of those that compete with domestic commodities. This method is very much in line with the principle of protectionist tariffs. However, for this reason, the "route" proposed by Hull will definitely not be achieved. Because the new tariff law still does not deviate from the old tariff routine, the result is still an "economic annihilation." When the Hawley Tariff was promulgated, the government also said that it was to promote the development of domestic industries and protect workers. However, the result was enough to intensify the international trade war, cause domestic industrial panic, and increase the number of unemployed workers. The Hull Tariff, in theory, is difficult to develop international trade and revitalize American foreign trade. However, whether the results can achieve this goal is questionable. Moreover, at this time when the economic panic is deepening, the revitalization of world trade cannot be solved by "international coordination." The center of the problem lies in the change in purchasing power. If those who have lost purchasing power cannot regain it, and those whose purchasing power is extremely weak cannot expand their purchasing power, then</p>

<p>How can a vagrant in a depressed city save his family trapped in a bankrupt rural area? I have neither the fortune for officialdom nor the ability to become a kidnapper. What unbearable persecution this is!</p>
<p>Summer Night Dream</p>
<p>Summer Night Dream is an exquisite term. I wonder who translated Shakespeare's famous play into this name. Now that summer has arrived, under the dim sky, with the aid of a few stars, it is even easier to recall these three beautiful words. In the poet's imagination, summer nights should have mysterious fireflies, gentle breezes like a kind mother's touch, the silence nurtured by the new moon, the peace of a conversation with a cigarette in hand, or even the swaying of plants and trees, and the songs of birds. However, being in this metropolis, the ugly streets destroy the poet's pastoral dreams. Even those said to be full of inspiration can only put aside the purity of mountains and forests and cool themselves by shaking a palm-leaf fan and wearing slippers in the alley, right? What a disheartening reality!</p>
<p>Summer nights are beautiful, and even in the city, they have a captivating posture, the coolness of the dance hall, the shimmering red lights in the darkness, the melodious music in the park, and even the water-like lamplight cast from the tips of the French parasol trees, all filled with the subtle beauty of music and poetry. Urban summer nights also have "dreams," and because of artificial embellishment, these "dreams" are even more enchanting. However, this is the privilege of only a select few. Those with empty pockets often wander hesitantly at the entrance of the dance hall, by the park fence, and near the city ferry terminal, feeling an inexplicable sadness all night long. "Summer Night Dream" must be made, and this "dream" must be beautiful. Without beauty, it cannot inspire, but the source of inspiration is that most vulgar thing: "money." "Summer Night Dream" and "money" seem incompatible, but in reality, they are closely related. Is it ridiculous to use money to buy a summer night dream? But a closer look will make you laugh and cry.</p>
<p>In my cramped little room, disturbed by the complexities of the world, I have also had dreams at night. However, these dreams are not as beautiful as the poet describes. I dream of widespread droughts across the country, floods with dirty water filling the ground and houses reduced to ruins, and countless people struggling on the edge of death. I feel that these are not beautiful dreams but nightmares, so under a wave of terrifying oppression, I wake up from my dream...</p>
<p>"Summer Night Dream," viewed from another perspective, is quite ugly!</p>
<p>Yet some people turn a blind eye to the tragic fate of this entire nation, mired in deep water and scorching heat, and intoxicate themselves with scarlet fantasies! What is on their cheeks is light laughter, and what fills their minds are happy expectations. They are enthusiastically and happily making "Summer Night Dream"! The fluttering shadows of pink dresses, the flowing glances of eyes, and the delicacy of small musical pieces all add infinite decoration to this beautiful dreamscape, like roses and monthly roses decorating a beautiful flower garden. And these people dancing in the "paradise on top of hell" will forever be drowned in the whirlpool of happiness, down and down...</p>
<p>Wake up! You people who are making "Summer Night Dream"!</p>
<h3>From Braids and Golden Lilies to Modern Civilization</h3>
<p>Returned students from abroad, upon arriving in China, mostly pinch their noses and say that China is full of stench. In addition, even high-ranking intellectuals exaggerate and talk about the ancient Chinese nation's "eating rats, eating snakes, watching executions, and men's braids, women's golden lilies," taking pleasure in it and expressing their hatred for the remnants of feudal consciousness. I do not linger over feudal society, with the intention of "playing with antiques when old for no reason, casually planting sesame seeds when idle," but I at least admit that this attitude is close to making fun of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Social systems are just like a piece of clothing. The feudal system, at a certain stage in history, also had historical achievements. Because the wheels of time are turning, feudal clothing is not only too narrow to wear, but also rotten—it can be said to be the remnant of remnants. Currently, capitalism has completed its historical mission, and the ideology of capitalist society also shows a symbol of "the end is coming."</p>
<p>The "eating rats, eating snakes" act is reappearing in capitalist society, and it has intensified and become "cannibalism." Tangible and intangible acts of cannibalism are being staged day and night in capitalist society. As for braids and golden lilies, there are also remnants of this kind of legacy on our fashionable young masters and misses.</p>
<p>"Watching executions" is considered by some to be a congenital pastime of the Chinese, but this trend has spread to civilized countries on the west coast of the Pacific. After the execution of the great thief Dillinger (see Shen Bao on July 25), the upper-class gentlemen of the United States were willing to bid hundreds of dollars for a piece of his bloody shirt and four pieces of street bricks, and were eager to see his body. This situation is very similar to the "barbaric Chinese" watching executions, as the Americans call it. In addition, buying bloody bricks and bloody clothes at high prices is also very similar to our "eating steamed buns dipped in blood."</p>
<p>Society is increasingly deteriorating. Our current main task is to recognize the direction of history and give this society an effective injection of fresh blood.</p>
<p>(Woodcut) by Luo Qingzhen</p>
<p>Three "What Should Our Society Do?" by Wang Ci</p>
<p>Eating chalk powder for several years gave me the first bad impression: "Children like to wear big hats."</p>
<p>During the secret period of vernacular literature, when children were asked to write essays, usually six or seven out of ten topics could be covered with a thousand-and-one formulaic big hat:</p>
<p>"The strength or weakness of a nation, the rise or fall of a people, all depend on..."</p>
<p>(Now it has been changed to: "Our China has weakened to the extreme, September 18th, January 28th..." - at a glance, they are the same, but the latter seems to have incorporated some "fashionable flavor" -)</p>
<p>Wearing it like this, no matter how pointed and small the head is, or how narrow and short the body is.</p>
<p>We often teach them:</p>
<p>"Children! Wearing this hat, I think it is old, big, dull, and pitiful. Don't you feel uncomfortable?"</p>
<p>Even though we often say this, it is still impossible to change. Several clever children will instead say behind their backs:</p>
<p>"Everyone has their own opinions, everyone has their own personality. I can't make a living without wearing this hat!"</p>
<p>Recently, several unknown young writers launched a "× Wind Literary Society." The three major proposals at the inaugural meeting are three big hats:</p>
<p>(1) ×× advocates ×× literature, promotes ××××, endangers national security and the survival of the nation. What attitude should our society express?</p>
<p>(2) ××× advocates humorous literature, weakens national consciousness, engages in empty talk that harms the country. What attitude should our society express?</p>
<p>(3) What should our society do to unite young writers from all over the world to launch a unified general attack on romantic decadence, feudal enslavement, and proletarian literature?</p>
<p>Two "nation," two "people," and three "what should our society do" have exposed how big these hats are.</p>
<p>Children! Wearing this hat, I think it is big, old, dull, and pitiful. Don't you feel uncomfortable?</p>
<p>(Rewarding) Cursing People is an Art by Manzhi</p>
<p>Clever people often come up with new tricks, and even cursing people has become an art. Moreover, the wonderful thing about the art of cursing people is that the person being cursed claps his hands and exclaims in admiration, only feeling that the article is well written and not caring about being cursed. Therefore, there are masters of cursing people in the literary world, and many disciples and grandchildren have been taught by the masters.</p>
<p>According to a certain publication's "The Art of Cursing People," it is divided into two types of cursing methods: the essence of applied military tactics and the essence of applied litigation codes. It turns out that the art of cursing people is formed by reading military tactics and ancestral litigation codes, which is truly knowledgeable and admirable. Regarding military tactics: (1) Know yourself and your enemy, (2) Retreat as an advance, (3) Flank attack, (4) Avoid the real and strike the false, (5) Surface defense, (6) Individual defeat, (seemingly defeat one by one?), (7) Entice the enemy to go deep, (8) Divide and conquer, (9) Feint to the east and attack the west, (10) Wait at ease for the tired. Regarding litigation codes: (1) Quibble, (2) Deny facts, (3) Downplay the serious, (4) Reverse black and white, (5) Make a mountain out of a molehill, (6) Cover up one's shortcomings, (7) Rehash old cases, (8) Expose privacy for revenge, (9) Use the topic to elaborate, (10) Personal attack—no wonder the trend of cursing people is rampant, and those who are cursed often lose the battle. They are strategists and lawyers!</p>
<p>Now some people use "name-spreading techniques" to curse people. They must cite facts, fabricate rumors, and try to make people curse themselves to justify themselves. Moreover, one side is cursing people to spread their name, and the other side is also spreading their own name. This kind of art of cursing people is probably applying the "retreat as an advance" in military tactics and the "using the topic to elaborate" in litigation codes. The person who comes out waving a feather fan seems to be a top student of the cursing master. I think if this trend continues, in the future, the disciples and grandchildren of the cursing master will be all over the world, and the Chinese literary world may be unified by the master's feather fan.</p>
<p>A Record of Showing Off One's Axe at Lu Ban's Door by Mulin</p>
<p>When a single volume is published, there are always a few introductory prefaces, which seems to have been the case since ancient times, so there is no need to say more. The people who write the prefaces are always well-known figures, so the single volume can "be brought along by the Buddha's foot" and spread without legs, which has also been the case since ancient times, so there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>This spring, "my friend" wanted me to write a preface for the single volume of a novel published in a certain supplement by "his friend." Checking in secret, "his friend" is a well-known figure, and is also the type who writes prefaces. The previous "× Flower Vase" had sold many banknotes. "My friend" brought up this proposal, and I thought it was another act of mischief by George Bernard Shaw. Who knew that the second time I met "my friend," he actually gave me the newspaper containing "his friend's" masterpiece, which seemed like humor had become close to nonsense. The white nose had to be wiped, and regardless of three sevens and twenty-one, I took it back and studied the masterpiece, also pretending to be serious and writing a preface.</p>
<p>Last month, I found that the book had been published in a certain bookstore. After careful flipping, everything was complete, starting from the strange things in ×× Pavilion, except for the preface. Thinking of showing off one's axe at Lu Ban's door, it was really asking for trouble. Thinking again of cherishing one's own worn-out broom, wanting to take it back and read it myself would also be enough to pass the time. So I entrusted a friend to write a letter, using two methods at the same time, but it was like a stone sinking into the sea. I only heard the sentence "What if it's lost?"</p>
<p>Later, I visited a friend at a certain broadcasting station and learned that "my friend's" "his friend" had put down his pen and was playing "Guanyin Opera." So "What if it's lost!" The depiction of General Liu's warlord temper in the play is lifelike. Such talent is rare? We literati have no choice but to file a complaint if we put down our pens, which is really embarrassing?</p>
<p>In the past, I read the Three Character Classic, which opened with: "At the beginning of man, his nature is good." I deeply suspected that the author was not truthful, but now I suddenly understand that the person who wrote "At the beginning of man" also put on a mask and said "his nature is good." A Record of Showing Off One's Axe at Lu Ban's Door is a good lesson, so I recorded it as a warning.</p>

<p>Supplement Editorial Department Novel Short Story Cooling Off (2) by Wenli</p>
<p>This ××× Garden, the southeast corner is the dance hall, and the northwest sides are the garden. The so-called garden only has a small area planted with two or three willow trees and other small miscellaneous trees surrounding a fountain. The rest of the area is a golf course. The golf course also has small hills and small holes, as well as bizarre and strange devices that cannot be named. In short, playing golf from the beginning to the end must pass through those many devices to make gentlemen, ladies, madams, and gentlemen happy and entertained. We won't talk about that for now. N followed his friend C to the west corner, picked a table, and sat around it. The table was covered by an umbrella that was so big that it couldn't be bigger. This umbrella reminded him of things seen in movies of seaside bathing places. N thought to himself: This umbrella is definitely not used to shelter from rain and dew. During the day, it must be open for people to shield themselves from the scorching sun. But it's so hot during the day, the only people who come here to cool off are probably fools, right? C was familiar with artists in the film industry. He greeted many people. N secretly asked him who they were. It turned out that they were all directors and stars. N secretly thought to himself that film practitioners are more generous than women. In other words, their lives are more modernized and bourgeois.</p>
<p>In the dance hall, red lights, green lights, and purple lights were constantly changing, and the music, fast and slow, was constantly changing with the lights. Some of the songs sounded as if the war had already begun, with thousands of horses galloping. The sounds were so rapid and short that they tightened people's hearts, and blood was boiling in their chests. Some of the songs were disheartening and desolate, as if orphans and widows whose country had been destroyed were crying and telling their sad history. Listening to it made one feel strangely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Dance?" C asked.</p>
<p>"No, it's better to listen to music."</p>
<p>N further explained that he was just here to cool off.</p>
<p>However, people were coming in and out of the dance hall entrance, and gentlemen and ladies were dancing in a drunken dream.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a small commotion arose among the people cooling off. They were whispering to each other, and their eyes were all looking over there. C told N in a low voice.</p>
<p>"××."</p>
<p>N's mind realized that she was a movie star. His eyes followed the people looking over there, and it was indeed her. She looked much fatter than she did on the screen. She greeted people everywhere and finally walked into the open-air small dance floor in the south corner. Some people followed her in.</p>
<p>"No wonder there are so many people cooling off here: there's dancing, there's music, and there are movie stars to embellish the scenery."</p>
<p>N said, and C laughed, saying that he was being too critical.</p>
<p>A cool breeze blew from the south corner, bringing the musical notes and the fragrance of ladies and madams' perfumes. N was not used to it. He didn't know if he had caught a cold, but he sneezed two or three times. C asked what was wrong. N replied, "I was knocked out by the perfume smell!" C laughed again, laughing at him as a country bumpkin who didn't have the fortune to enjoy it. N was sitting among the gentlemen, ladies, madams, and gentlemen, nominally cooling off, but in fact he was uneasy, sweat was flowing on his forehead, and his heart was constantly beating. He didn't want to cool off any longer and insisted on leaving. C said that he wanted to sit down, so there was no way. N walked out of that dreamlike realm alone in embarrassment—in his case, he walked out of a demon's den.</p>
<p>It was already late at night. There were no buses or trams. N thought that he hadn't wandered the streets late at night for a long time, so tonight he would just walk home in the cool air. Rickshaws surrounded him but he ignored them, and walked south step by step. The Jing'an Temple Road was quiet and there were no other pedestrians. The summer night wind gently caressed N's hair, and the air was much cleaner than in the ××× Garden.</p>

<h3>Dismissal of Ambassador to Italy and Austria</h3>
<p>Unreserved Admission of Involvement in Coup</p>
<p>Vienna - Dr. Lindner, the former Austrian Ambassador to Italy, was intended by the rebel party to be installed as the head of government after the coup. After the failure, he attempted suicide but did not die. Doctors have performed two surgeries to save him, but his condition remains critical. Today, the cabinet has dismissed him from his post. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Vienna - After the Austrian Ambassador to Italy, Dr. Lindner, attempted suicide and was injured, his injuries were quite severe. However, a preliminary statement has now been taken. It is rumored that the crimes committed by Lindner, as proven, are even more serious than generally suspected. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - Yugoslav newspapers claim that the Vienna incident on July 25th was a trick played by Germany. As for why Austrian Ambassador to Italy, Lindner, was chosen as their tool, it was because Lindner was relatively close to National Socialism and because Lindner was stationed in Italy and had close relations with Mussolini. Germany hoped that if necessary, Lindner could persuade Mussolini not to send troops to intervene. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Papen's Appointment as Envoy to Austria Reveals New German Policy</h3>
<p>Germany Has Not Yet Officially Notified Austria</p>
<p>Austrian Approval May Be Conditional</p>
<p>(Berlin) - It was decided yesterday that Austria would recognize German Vice-Chancellor Papen as the German envoy to Austria. It is expected that the formal announcement will be made in the middle of next week. Official circles believe that if Austria recognizes Papen as the envoy but attaches conditions, Germany will regard it as a serious insult, which may prevent Papen from departing for Austria. According to official circles, Papen's special mission in Vienna will be to restore normal relations between Germany and Austria. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Vienna - Germany has sought Austria's consent for the appointment of Vice-Chancellor Papen as the German envoy to Austria. The Austrian government has not yet responded and is expected to make a decision next week. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) - Some foreign newspapers have expressed surprise at Papen's appointment as a special envoy to Austria. German newspapers here believe that this expression is affected because special envoys are very common in diplomatic history. For example, France's Hervé Alphand was also a special envoy to Romania.

<h3>Britain Concerned About Austrian Changes During Vacation</h3>
<p>Constant Communication with London Across the Ocean</p>
<p>Halifax, Canada - British Prime Minister MacDonald, who is currently vacationing here, is paying close attention to news from Austria. However, so far, he has refused to issue any statement. MacDonald is currently communicating with the London government daily. However, unless the Austrian changes become dangerous, the Prime Minister will not temporarily cut short his vacation and return home. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Italy Deploys Troops on the Border to Prevent Changes</h3>
<p>Distrust of Germany; Dissatisfaction with Papen as Envoy to Austria</p>
<p>Suspecting it is a Prelude to Fully Nationalizing Austria</p>
<p>50,000 to 60,000 Troops Engaged in Exercises</p>
<p>Rome - The appointment of German Vice-Chancellor Papen as the German envoy to Austria has aroused much criticism in Rome. It is pointed out that Hitler's sudden announcement of Papen's appointment to Austria without first seeking Vienna's consent is an extraordinary method, different from diplomatic custom. Italian people are speculating about whether Papen is on a peaceful mission or whether his stationing in Vienna is merely a prelude to Germany's active behavior to nationalize Austria. Although the Italian government is satisfied that the overall situation in Austria has not caused international disputes, it distrusts Germany and is determined not to relax its vigilance in preparing for changes on the Austrian border. There are rumors that the Italian government has deployed troops on the border with Yugoslavia, but official circles in Rome say this is completely unfounded. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome - According to non-official estimates, the Italian army currently concentrated near the Italian-Austrian border, including light tank units and artillery units, numbers around 50,000 to 60,000. These troops have long been stationed on the border, engaged in mountain warfare training at the two fortresses leading into Austria. Therefore, in reality, there is no troop movement. The government does not say that the troops are conducting field exercises on the border but instead says that it is deploying troops to the border to prepare for changes, which has a political effect. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Vienna - People in Innsbruck believe that Italian troops are currently densely concentrated in the Bolzano and Brenner Pass areas. One mixed-composition team is stationed between the Brenner and Isarco passes. As soon as they receive an alarm, they can use the convenience of motor transport to go to Innsbruck and the area bordering German Bavaria and Austria. The team has several tanks and mountain cannons and can reach Innsbruck within an hour and the German border within three hours. The Italian military commander in the area is General Pavani, who visited the area bordering Austrian and German Bavaria this spring for a detailed inspection. People in Innsbruck now believe that since German Chancellor Hitler has adopted a compromising attitude, Italy will not intervene militarily. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Relieved</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - Yugoslav political circles were quite alarmed when they previously heard that Italian troops had entered the Austrian border.

<h3>Britain, France, and Italy Find it Difficult to Align Their Actions on Austrian Affairs</h3>
<p>Italy Unwilling to Join Britain and France in Protesting to Germany</p>
<p>Expressing Each Has the Right to Freedom of Action</p>
<p>Rome - The envoy newspaper published an article commenting on the Austrian changes. It is said that the wording was directly instructed by Prime Minister Mussolini, and people in the capital paid special attention to the newspaper's conclusion. The conclusion roughly stated, "If other governments make representations to Berlin, Italy will not participate. This goes without saying because the German government often breaks its promises." It also stated, "Today, all governments have the right to restore complete freedom of action regarding Germany." (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) - Britain, France, and Italy are continuing to exchange opinions on the Austrian issue. If necessary, they may make representations to Germany to guarantee Austria's independence. However, it is not yet known in what form this representation will take. L'Écho de Paris recently explained the positions adopted by the three countries, saying, "London once inclined towards convening a meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, but is now clearly adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Rome no longer seems prepared to make representations to Germany jointly by Italy, France, and the United States based on the Four-Power Pact, but advocates being realistic and not making empty words. As for France, it is said that it once also inclined towards convening a meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, but it is now also clearly taking a wait-and-see attitude. In short, before expressing any attitude, the three countries are waiting to find a common possible occasion." Le Petit Journal said that Italy is paying close attention to the Austrian changes, so the immediate danger has dissipated. "However, if Italy intervenes alone, the danger is very great. To prevent incidents, Britain, France, and Italy should cooperate to ensure that people abide by the treaty." (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italian and German Newspapers Revile Each Other</h3>
<p>Italian Newspapers Incite Military Action</p>
<p>German Public Opinion Refuses to Remain Silent</p>
<p>(Berlin) - Starting today, German newspapers have begun to openly counterattack Italian newspapers' attacks on Germany. The attitude they are adopting seems to be that if German public opinion's previous silence continues, it may be mistaken for Germany having tacitly admitted its guilt. The Lokal-Anzeiger's editorial today stated, "The arguments disclosed by Italian newspapers in recent days are truly unforgivable and inconceivable. All the editorials of Italian newspapers say that Italy is prepared to maintain Austria's independence, even resorting to force. Even semi-official organs such as Il Giornale d'Italia openly demand, 'Facts, not empty words.'" The Berliner Achtuhr-Abendblatt made the following statement regarding the Berliner Neueste Nachrichten's report on the Italian army's actions, "The arguments of Italian public opinion in recent days are that military action may be better than diplomatic action, but in fact, neither is useful because the claim that Germany is interfering in Austria's internal affairs is a figment of the Italian newspapers' imagination, based on the fantasies in the minds of commentators." The Berliner Tageblatt's commentary today also stated, "Since Friday, Italian newspapers have unanimously taken 'Implementation, not empty words' as their slogan, but it is not known whether what they call implementation is still based on fantasy."

<h3>Franco-German Trade Agreement Established</h3>
<p>Trade and Debt Resolved Simultaneously</p>
<p>(Paris) - The Franco-German trade agreement was signed in Berlin today. It is said that the agreement will establish the principle of a Franco-German trade clearinghouse to guarantee the monthly repayment of Dawes and Young loans. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) - After the Franco-German commercial negotiations began on June 22nd, several agreements have now been signed, which will take effect on August 1st: (1) The Treaty of Trade, Residence, and Navigation, which is a revision of the main parts of the Franco-German commercial treaty of August 17, 1927, is for long-term application. (2) The Franco-German trade exchange method, which stipulates until December 31st of this year. This method stipulates that the two countries' mutual restrictions on the quantity of imports will be slightly improved. (3) The agreement to establish a commercial bill exchange office in the two countries, and all goods transported from the French customs area and French overseas territories enjoy its benefits. (4) The agreement to repay the principal and interest of the Dawes and Young loans. All such loans issued in France and issued abroad that were owned by French people or natural and moral persons within France before June 15th will be handled in accordance with this agreement. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) - Since Germany announced the suspension of debt payments, French exporters and holders of Dawes and Young loans have been extremely uneasy. Since the signing of the commercial and financial agreement between France and Germany in Berlin today, this sense of unease has been eliminated, because the trade and debt issues between France and Germany have been resolved by the signing of this agreement.

<h3>Roosevelt Attaches Importance to the Hawaiian Islands</h3>
<p>Never Forgetting that They Are Part of the Whole United States</p>

<p>Honolulu - President Roosevelt and his entourage departed from Honolulu today amid cheers. The President and his two sons waved their handkerchiefs and smiled at the send-off from the side of the Houston cruiser. The American military band on shore and the band on the ship echoed each other. The President's two sons, who came to Honolulu for the second time, were very interested in the trip and originally planned to stay for a few more days. They finally decided to return to Washington with their father. Before boarding the ship, the President gave a speech to the people of Honolulu on the platform of the Governor's Office. He said, "I have been very impressed with my trip to Honolulu. The government will never forget that Honolulu is part of the whole United States. In fact, there are many places on the mainland whose economic and living standards are far inferior to those of Honolulu. Therefore, I believe that the United States can be proud of having Honolulu." The President also planted a tree in the courtyard of the Governor's Office, naming it the "New Deal" tree, as a memorial to this trip. (28th National Telegram) Honolulu - President Roosevelt has recently departed from here, taking the "USS Houston" to Portland, USA. Before leaving, he gave a brief speech, saying goodbye to the people of Hawaii, stating that the people of Hawaii are an inseparable part of the American nation. The people of Hawaii are the same as the United States, consisting of a mixture of different ethnic groups, but they can all unite and be loyal to the country, and have a deep understanding of the most noble purposes of the United States. This is what I am proud of on this trip. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Stratosphere Ascent Fails</h3>
<p>Reaching a Height of 57,000 Feet from the Ground</p>
<p>The Balloon Could Not Withstand the Air Pressure and Ruptured</p>
<p>All Three Occupants Were Fortunately Unharmed</p>
<p>Holechick, USA - The large stratosphere exploration balloon, originally intended to break the world altitude record, has fallen due to a rupture of the balloon. All three people in the balloon landed by parachute. The balloon was completely damaged, and most of the testing equipment was also damaged. However, all three landed safely. This ascent reached a maximum of 57,000 feet. The world record is 61,237 feet. Captain Stevens, as a scientific observer, jumped out first, about 2,000 feet from the ground. Captain Anderson, as an adjutant, jumped out at 1,000 feet. Commander Kepner jumped out only at 500 feet. The balloon landed on a farmer's field at 2:49, about seven miles from here. The accident occurred when the balloon rose to 57,000 feet. Because the balloon could not withstand the air pressure, several places ruptured and turned outward like an umbrella caught in the wind. The balloon drifted southeast in the air, about 500 feet per minute. Initially, the balloon sent out reports by radio from time to time. At 8:35 AM, it said it had reached 14,000 feet. It was not until 12:49 PM that a report was received, saying that the balloon was broken and they had to descend, but the balloon was out of control, so it was now suspended in the air. At this time, it was already difficult to generate electricity. At 1:50 PM, a report was received again, saying that it had dropped to 37,000 feet. Soon the balloon could be seen, and then it crashed to the ground. The ascent was sponsored by the American Geographical Society and the Army Air Corps. The equipment was very thorough. The purpose was to collect air 15 miles above the ground and study various physical phenomena. The structure of the balloon was also very strong, using specially made cotton cloth coated with rubber up to 30 times, but it still could not withstand the air pressure. Some of the testing equipment in the balloon was first wrapped in a parachute by the people in the balloon and thrown out of the balloon, so it was not all damaged. (28th National Telegram)</p>
