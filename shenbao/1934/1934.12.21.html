<p>不恤對日表示親善</p>
<p>先從經濟提携入手</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英國實業恊會滿洲調查團之報告書、偏日已經公佈、文長三十六頁、主張英日兩國應締結經濟恊約、而放棄遍及全球之商務戰爭、報告書稱、所謂「滿洲國」政府已準備提出建議、請英國實業界參加發展「滿洲國」、並謂明年英國鋼鐵出品運往滿洲及日本之合同、已經成立、報告書復稱、「滿洲國」當局會以書面保證給與該團主席巴恩貝爵士、謂英國合作發展「滿洲國」之原則、業已切實接受、報告書雖屢言調查團並無政治性質、然其語氣對於日本非常親善、祇於日本政策及行政之若干方面稍示批評、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英國實業聯合會所派赴日滿考察之委員團、返國多日、其報告書甫於今日發表、文中聲明該委員團純屬非官塲與非政治性質、外間所傳團員有發政治性質之言論者、實屬毫無根據、現因該團曾訂有新合同、故英國實業聯合會益便於介紹有志事業者與日本主要事業界與政界、文中並勸有關係之商行早派負責之代表實地考察各問題、此次在日、覺日人對英、實抱有眞正友好精神、此種友好精神、因委員團之遊日、及英日實業界在倫敦東京兩處成立永久之連鎖、而益見鞏固、委員團於遊歷後、切實决定關於目前之迅速發展、英國實業殊有開拓之機會、並已向「滿洲國」當局供獻英國實業之合作、嗣接書面保證、接受此種合作之原則、贊助此種合作之具體建議、不日將提交委員團、俾英國實業得大事參加現在計議中之發展事業、惟關於貨價與付欵辦法、將互相商妥、以爲參加之豫備、關於以鋼造品供給日本而於一九三五年在日滿交貨一事、已成立妥恊、其細則已通告英國鋼鐵業聯合會矣、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英國產業聯盟遠東調查團之報告書全文、逹三十六頁、共一萬二千餘字、計分本文與附屬書二類、二十日以巴恩貝爵士名義發表、其中要項如下、</p>
<p>（一）調查團查日本及「滿國」之實情、經交涉結果、對於開發滿洲由英國產業經營等、準備提出種種提案、現已成立明年英國供給綱鐵製品與日本及滿洲之恊定、又「滿國」允諾由英國恊力開發之文件、業已面交巴團長、故調查團已獲得關於商業上請求之保證、因此英國確在「滿國」獲得大量販路、</p>
<p>（一）日「滿」兩國均以日金爲本位貨幣、故有形成通貨同盟之可能性、（一）今後數年「滿國」缺乏長期放欵之可能性、故關於滿洲企業之重要企圖、其付欵不能不以後付之組織爲基礎、</p>
<p>（一）英國產業聯盟與日本經濟聯盟對於經濟之恊力、經恊議結果、决在倫敦東京各設委員會、並决定恊力方針之諸欵項如下、（甲）有意義且方向一定之輸出統制爲基礎之市塲分割、（乙）地域市塲之分割、（丙）互相關於開發未開發市塲之活動、（丁）輸出價格之恊定·形式·品質等之生產合理化、（戊）製造廠之共同經營（一）商業上之英日對立現如尖鋭化、惟日本品將來似將變爲高級品、輸出亦將增加、如纎維工業·水泥·橡皮等、又尙有羊毛工業品機械類等亦將進出、因此不免激烈競爭、但不信日本品能盡霸佔世界市塲、</p>
<p>（一）視察團希望日本確保英國商人之利益、又英國因保持英國品之販路或站於不得不採取艱苦手段之立場、但英日兩國若繼續商業上相殺之競爭、則其結果實難預測、因此切望日英兩國調整產業、又英國產業在不滿足狀態、而日本產業之誇稱優秀者、其結果由於產業合理化云、（二十日電通電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>海上自由與美國中立　延</h3>
<p>公海不受任何國家法權之支配。係國際法基本原則之一。是以一國平時在公海上之船舶得視爲本國活動的領土。非他人所得而干涉。但在國際戰爭局面下。中立國船舶應受交戰國海軍之搜索。仍爲各國所公認。搜索結果。如發見有運往敵國之違禁品。自可實行加以没收。至於不屬違禁品性質之敵方船貨。可否加以同樣處置。則爲一絶大疑問。蓋據一八五六年之巴黎宣言。凡由中立國船舶運輸之交戰國貨物。及由交戰國船舶運輸之中立國貨物。除違禁品外。皆不受敵方之没收。其間規定本極明顯。惜在歐戰期間。先之以德人之潛艇政策。繼之以英法之報復行動。舉凡中立國之行船自由皆横遭剥奪。巴黎宣言之精神。乃蕩焉無存。巴黎宣言中之原則。在今後之戰爭中。能否爲交戰國所尊重。已難逆料。而况所謂違禁品之性質如何。亦無法定標準。交戰國與中立國之觀點旣相迥異。則糾紛之來。自有必然者。</p>
<p>美國素抱海上自由之原則。以爲交戰國對於中立國之行船及經商自由。當予以最大之尊重。威爾遜總統在一九一八年一月中嘗有「十四要點」之宣佈。其中有云。海上航行應享絶對的自由。···惟爲厲行國際盟約起見。以國際的行動封鎖公海之全部或一部者。則應歸例外。蓋威氏鑒於美國上届參戰。實起因於維護海上自由之原則。故欲假國際恊贊之方式。尊重此一原則。以避免將來之重蹈覆轍也。</p>
<p>顧以近代戰爭之激烈。及其犠牲之重大。任何國家一旦捲入漩渦。惟知克敵制勝是務。輒不問國際信義爲何物。縱在平時有尊重海上自由之約。戰時爲貫澈其作戰精神計。竟至食言背約。亦非不可能。中立國若徒以口舌爭。必無所補於毫末。勢非自甘退讓或以武力維護其中立權利不可。自甘退讓無論已。若以武力爲維護中立之工具。則未有不毀棄其中立地位而至於參戰者。上届歐戰期内。美國在對德宣戰之前。幾與英人相决裂。卽因英人處處破壤其海上自由及中立之地位。其後所以聯合英人而對德作戰者。則以英人所損害者係美人之財產。而德人所損害者係美人之生命。財產與生命相權衡。固生命爲重也。由是觀之。美人旣不能自信今後交戰國必能尊重其海上自由。又不欲以武力維持其中立地位。則舍修正其傳統的政策外。自無其他途徑可行也。</p>
<p>近數日來。美國修改中立原則之説。甚囂塵上。吾人觀察内幕。固知非偶然也。言夫此事之意義。第一則表示世界二次大戰之醖釀。已日趨成熟。美國作此姿態。以自明其不欲捲入戰爭之心理。第二則示意日本。在今後之國際戰爭中。美國雖不願輕易與日本以兵戎相見。但亦不將以維持其海上自由政策故。使對日作戰之各方面感覺行動之拘束。第三則結歡英人。俾知在今後任何局面下。英美二國必不致有衝突之可能。蓋英國屬地遍天下。一旦參戰。勢必影響全球。若英人不肯放棄其搜索中立國船舶及封鎖敵港之權利。美人又欲堅持其海上自由之政策。則二國衝突必難避免。反之。美人而願自動讓步。則有助於英人之作戰便利者實多。英美二國旣有此種默契。日人雖强。亦必不敢輕舉妄動也。</p>

<h3>發表公報</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　參加倫敦海軍初步談話之英美日三國代表團全體代表、於本日午後齊集下議院麥唐納首相辦公室、舉行最後一次全體會議。宣佈海軍初步談話、無限期延會、會議後、向報界發表關於海軍談話延期之公報如下、</p>
<p>「本日午後、英美日三國代表團在下議院内討論與海軍初步談話延期有關之各項事件、由英國首相麥唐納主席、出席者、美國方面爲首席代表台維斯·海軍參謀長史丹萊·駐英大使館參贊阿德頓·海軍專家都曼休曼上校·鄧肯少校·費爾德·及列勃爾等、日本方面爲首席代表駐英松平大使·首席專門委員山本少將·及專門委員加藤·岩下·溝田等、英國方面爲首相麥唐納·外相西門·海軍大臣孟塞爾·海軍上將却德飛爵士·費涉爵士·海軍中將李德爾克萊奇等、討論結果、僉以爲海軍談話發軔於本年六月間、至本年十月二十三日以後繼續進行、以至於今、英美日三國政府代表一致承認此項談話、必可有所裨益、查此項談話原係爲一九三○年倫敦海軍條約所規定之未來海軍會議、作初步之準備、俟經提出各項建議後、談話範圍愈益擴大、關於海軍問題之各方面、均經相互作坦白及友好之討論、至於急切獲得結論、本非初步談話之目的、初步談話之目的、僅在爲未來海軍會議作成立恊定之準備而已、法國與意大利同爲現行海軍條約之簽字國、故本年夏間舉行初步談話時、曾由該兩國參加討論、嗣後又曾以　談話發展情形、隨</p>
<p>時通知該兩國、出席此項談話之三國政府、雖贊成繼續限制海軍軍備並縮减海軍以至有關係各國所能同意之限度、然貫澈此項目的所需之原則及其方法、則尙有待於决定、目前談話已逹相當之階段、三國代表咸認爲應於此時宣佈延期、俾各國代表得乘機與各本國政府當面磋商、並將談話結果所產生之局勢、作更充分之分析及考慮、爲此經三國代表一致贊同、海軍談話於目前卽行延期、同時與倫敦談話有關之各國政府、應相互保持密切之聯絡、並更須與倫敦及華盛頓條約其他締約國保持密切之聯絡、談話延期、並可使英國政府獲得機會、以與英國各自治領政府進行磋商、再者、就過去談話所完成之準備工作而論、深冀此後局勢有所發展、俾下届談話於逹到適宜時機時、可迅速舉行、英國爲本届初步談話之發起者、則對於下届談話、亦應由英國採取適當之步骤」云云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>西門廣播演説</h3>
<p>廢除海約係日本自由</p>
<p>認海軍新恊定未絶望</p>
<p>保持安全英尤屬切要</p>
<p>（倫敦）　外相西門於今晚發表無線電廣播演説、評論海軍談判延期之方式、宣稱海軍談判或將於兩三個月内重開、西門演説中謂「日本將不出本月卽十二月内、</p>
<p>通告廢止華盛頓海軍條約、關於此節、日本政府已不復加以隠秘、此固吾人所深爲扼腕者也、然當知日本固有通告廢約之完全自由、無論何人均無權加以反對、且對於日本此種行動、加以過分悲觀亦屬不當、須知華盛頓海約通告廢止後、其有効時期尙有兩年、（按華盛頓海約規定至一九三六年底滿期）在此時期内、各國儘可成立海軍新恊定、苟其不然、將來各國如不能訂結條約、對於海軍之總噸數及各級軍艦之最大噸數加以限制、則全世界必遭遇可怖之災禍、蓋過去對於軍縮之努力、其成効力卓著、未有如華盛頓倫敦兩海約者、此兩海軍條約、使有關係各國節省千百萬之金錢、使各國獲得安全之感覺、並相互合作以保障和平、吾人决定竭盡一切、以使今後保全此種制度者、職是故耳、英帝國對於其廣大之自治領及殖民地負有責任、不容放棄、故凡爲吾國安全所必需者、吾人决不讓步、然同時吾人亦當爲他國設身處地、一加考慮、並與他國通力合作、以期訂立各國所同意之計畫、此計畫必須使各國咸獲公平之待遇、並須包含日前余在下院提出之主張、此主張爲何、卽「安全之平等爲各民族應有之權利是也」西門續稱、日本曾提出若干建議、其大意乃在另建一種基本制度、以代替現行海軍條約、此項基本制度、可使各國建造軍艦以逹所謂「共同之最高限度」、因此吾人以爲日本實行建造海軍、以逹共同最高限度、當係日本此項建議之必然的結果、蓋日本本欲有此一舉、且認此舉爲合時宜、故乃要求確定海軍逹到共同最高限度之權利耳、然據吾人之見解、欲求安全平等、尙有其他辦法可以逹到、吾人以爲吾英國領土兼跨歐亞兩洲、而遍佈全世界之英國屬地尙未計算在内、英國所負責任、範圍較爲廣大、則爲保持安全平等起見、英國擁有比較更大之海軍、實屬必要、舉例以明之、他國海軍有集中太平洋之可能、然英國海軍欲全部集中太平洋、則爲勢所不許、至於樹立新恊定基礎、雖爲期尙遠、有待於長時期之努力、然余所能爲諸君告者、</p>
<p>余縱不請求任何國家抛棄其各自所認爲最關重要之原則、但吾人實已受有約束、必須設法樹立可爲各方面所接受之在礎、俾現行條約滿期後、世界不至遭遇無限制軍備競爭之禍害、英國政府本爲此次海軍初步談話之發起者、倘至適宜時機、英國自當採取合宜之步驟、要之、倘無此次初步談話、及吾人在初步談話中所表現之理性、則未來之海軍正式會議未必有成功之望也」云（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日代表留倫敦</h3>
<p>繼續技術討論</p>
<p>美代表定月杪歸國</p>
<p>（倫敦）　路透社從美代表團方面探悉、美代表以爲今日公報説明現狀、至爲翔實、綜述内情亦復正確、公報對於美方地位、亦能概括無遺、而文中不言及談話復開之期、尤使美方寛慰、聞在自今日始至年底止一時期中、英日代表將作關於技術事件之談話、而美代表將於月底離英、英代表方面謂此次休會眞是休會、今後目的、在由尋常與外交途徑準備於一九三五年大會前重開討論、庶使大會得告成功、衆料外交接洽之開始、必在日本廢止華盛頓海軍條約之後、届時其所討論者、將爲以互換造艦程序爲根據之英國方案、如三國意見接近、則將設法復開談話、聞英國對於日本取消華盛頓海軍條約之意見、固認爲極爲嚴重、但覺此約之聲明廢止、並未毀減將來妥恊之希望、英方未見有日本欲廢止九國公約與太平洋四國條約之表徴、僅覺日本欲談判一種海軍新約而已、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國手腕巧妙</h3>
<p>英美對廢約看法不同</p>
<p>（倫敦）　海軍預備會商由共同發表宣言、已告一段落、但自會商之前後以迄今日、其外交手腕最爲巧妙者、當莫遇於英國政府、其對於日本代表團則以其妥恊試案而保持連絡、對美國代表團則以不卽不離之關係而極力維持、</p>
<p>至英美兩國對於日本廢除華府海約案其見解完全不同、美國代表團以爲廢約、當係破壤集團和平機關之行爲、而英國政府當局則以廢約須盡量視爲無足輕重、廢除條約正如解除租屋契約、此外則無意義、現在正如住留所借居之屋内而訂立新租約、以便確保其有利之條件而已、此種觀察殊覺令人尋味、（二十日日聯電</p>

<p>海軍根據地謀恢復防禦工程</p>

<p>（華盛頓）　今日報界中人訪海軍部長史璜生、問及日本將廢止華府海軍公約、美國造艦程序將如何進行、史氏答曰、吾國海軍固常在海上也、史氏又謂按照該約條欵、廢止後兩年内仍有效力、吾人自應行其所必要與正當者、以保衛美國與其工商業、史氏又答另一問話、謂華府海軍公約簽字後所中止之海軍根據地防禦工程程序、今後加以完成之决議、今在保留中云、（十九日路透電）</p>

<p>説明不能共同廢約理由</p>
<p>（巴黎）　法外長賴伐爾曾與日本駐法大使作長時間之談話、討論海軍談判休會及日内閣决定宣布廢棄海軍條約問題賴氏則重行聲明、法國爲外交及策略關係、不能作共同廢棄華盛頓海約之行動云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>英美輿論一斑</h3>
<p>日威脅世界和平</p>
<p>延會即失敗之徴</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　共和黨參議員波拉以爲日本之宣告廢止華府海約、固爲可惜、但美國不能由此推論日本係對美國採取挑戰態度、又奥勒岡丹參議員、斯德魏爾、謂日本態度足爲和平威脅、但其論調、尙屬温和、至於紐約郵報、則謂日本係蔑視世界一切國家、世界電聞報、謂世界又將作軍備競爭、而始作俑者、實爲日本、國務院對日本樞密院之决定、不作任何評論、（按本日日本樞密院舉行御前會議、一致贊助日本政府、廢止華府海約之决定、）一般人以爲一九三六年各海軍國將重開會議、蘇俄或亦參加、吾人宜靜待此時期之來臨、一九三六年以前、海軍軍備競爭、不致開始、蓋截至一九三六年止、華府海約所定之原則、其他簽字國及華盛頓仍當遵守也、（按華府海約須於滿期二年前、宣告廢止、但在宣告廢止後二年以内、仍繼續有效）（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　此間大多數報紙、對於海軍談話宣告延期一事、今晨均有評論、工黨機關報每日民聲報、及自由主義新聞紀事報、皆以爲延期卽係失敗之徴、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今日批評海軍談話休會者、皆嘆惜其未有更顯明之結果、但承認此次談話已置立將來談判之基礎、以爲華盛頓海軍條约有效時期、尙有兩年、故有充分時間覔取低替軍備競爭之辦法、倫敦泰晤士報謂英代表之外交、確屬正當、其所居之調解人地位、已博得美日雙方之不少信任、而英日密約説之虚僞有害、尤不待言、華盛頓條約予簽約者以許多利益、今東京廢止之、負有重大責任、但東京旣以廢約僅爲另訂新約之一種手段爲言、可見三國之有一個旨趣、卽成立良好如舊約之新約是也云、每日電聞言及顏面問題、謂爲設法以滿足日方之情感、因老羞成怒之日本、將使解决遠東大問題之希望、竟成泡影也、目前尙未危險之僵局或易變成危險、如依然解决無策、則英國與其自治地必須共同籌議英國政治家罕遇之最艱難的英帝國政策問題、（二十日路透電）</p>

<h3>巴拿馬運河防務至重要</h3>
<p>二十敢死隊半天内可摧毀</p>
<p>日漁夫鉛錘垂釣原在測量</p>
<p>美雜誌著論促人猛省</p>
<p>（紐約）　巴拿馬首都出版之巴拿馬美國雜誌主人郎斯凡爾、今日在此聲稱、如有敢死隊二十人、卽可使巴拿馬運河於十二小時内毀爲粉碎、此種行動實屬輕而易舉、然其結果可使運河歷久不能商航、修理工作雖能卽刻進行、亦不能指日開通、蓋運河尙有若干重要地點仍毫無防禦也、巴拿馬美國雜誌曾屢屢著論促人猛省、陸軍當局現在雖已增加防軍、然最重要之地點仍未有防範、郎氏復稱、卜居運河地帶之日本人百分之七十五、皆無固定收入、設理髮所者終日不剪一髮、設襯衫廠者終日不售一衣、設料理館者終日不烹一菜、漁夫所用釣竿、以鋼爲絲、以鉛爲餌、其端無鈎、故其工作顯係測量運河之深淺而已、陸軍長官不願平民告以保護運河更加適當之方法、故對於其論文漫不經意云、按巴拿馬運河之防務在平時幾全爲美國陸軍之責任、海軍雖有若干附屬軍艦巡邏中美各部、固對於巴拿馬運河之防務毫無關係者也、（十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福無意闢新運河</h3>
<p>用滑稽口吻答客問</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　客有問羅斯福總統對於開鑿尼加拉圭運河、其個人有何切實意見者、羅氏但以滑稽之口吻作答云、彼家中所有往日尼加拉圭運河公司等於廢紙之股票</p>
<p>、多至足敷糊裱大室一間之用、羅氏此語蓋指以前屢次擬鑿運河之計劃而言、至美國開鑿尼加拉圭運河之權利、則係於一九一六年與尼國訂約、以美金三百萬元購得、此欵用途須由美國監督、沿運河路綫有一太平洋鐵道、係尼國所有、惟其股份紐約銀行家佔百分之五十一、再由銀行家轉售美國民間、及運河計劃失敗、此種股票亦毫無價値、羅總統今日之表示、可見政府方面無意在此時闢此運河也、（十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>英相著文論戰爭危機</h3>
<p>軍備競爭無法防止</p>
<p>單獨裁軍無補和平</p>
<p>（倫敦）麥唐納首相今日警告稱、如英國充實國防、而不能避免歐洲之軍備競爭、則二次歐戰無可避免云、首相將此意撰文寄交十二月號國民工黨雜誌發表、該雜誌已於今日出版、首相雖堅持避免軍備競爭、但亦不贊成以身作則之裁軍、謂以身作則之裁軍、在國際目光中、實無補於和平、英國雖努力裁軍以爲天下倡、但英國銷燬最後一艘戰艦及轟炸機時、和平仍遙遙無期、此時英國之和平努力亦必徒勞無功云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<h3>西北視察記　本報特派記者賡雅</h3>
<p>哈密概况</p>
<p>（一）沿革　哈密漢爲伊吾廬地、屬匈奴、明</p>
<p>帝取之、置宜禾都尉、三國屬鮮卑、朿晉前凉張駿據之、北魏屬蠕蠕、文帝太和十二年、以城内附、後魏爲鄯善·吐魯番、西突厥佔據、隋大業六年、設伊吾郡、隋亂、復爲西突厥所據、唐觀四年、降置西伊州、後改伊州、天寳初爲伊吾郡、乾元初復爲伊州、（轄伊吾·柔遠·納職三縣）廣德後、没於吐番、據其地者陳氏、自唐開元迄宋初凡十世、雍熙以後、屬西州阿薩蘭回鶻、元時稱哈密力、轄於火州之畏兀兒）明永樂中酋長安磢帖木耳降封忠順王、立哈密衛、正德後爲吐番酋長莽肅爾所據、閉嘉關、棄哈密、後又内附清初、哈密衛輝和爾都督降、至吐侖泰爲王、助河西回丁國棟作亂、被誅、康熙二十六年、酋長額貝都拉俘噶爾丹子以獻、賜札薩克印綬、始内屬、乾隆設哈密廳、光緒初改省、升直隸廳、民國二年、改哈密縣、有回漢新三城、勢若犄角、回漢兩城甚高固、亲城兵壘、多已蕩然、</p>
<p>（二）面積　東西長一千零十五里、南北闊數百里不等、有多至九百五十里者、面積至少在四十萬方里以上、</p>
<p>（三）人口　全縣纏民三千一百零八户、計一萬七千七百二十八人、漢民二百十八户、計七百二十三人、回民三百四十户、計五百八十六人、統計約三千六百餘户、二萬餘人（註、境内有哈薩帪房五千餘頂、每户三人至五人不等、生活遊牧不定、故未列入固定人口數、）</p>
<p>（四）山川形勢　城區近郊有水流二道、一曰「蘇巴什水」、源出城北四里之蘇巴什湖、湖形月牙、泉湧終歲不涸、該地較平野高出十丈、泉水西南流、繞城北、分渠凡三、灌漑近郊、菜圃瓜園、農民利賴焉、一曰「申巴圖水」、源出城北東山之榆樹溝、流經石城子·小灣·塞巴什諸村、灌地凡千餘畝、初爲東南流、轉向西南、繞城南入小南湖、與蘇巴什水合流至南湖、（城南七十里）旋没於沙、哈密地勢、東北高、而西南平下、形如捲蓆、東南無村莊、爲平衍無際之戈壁、西南村落分佈、如棋子之散置、東北西北、爲天山東脈綿延地帶、山峯高聳、素稱天險、纏民據爲根據地、</p>
<p>（五）商業　哈密商業、尙爲萌芽時代、其社</p>
<p>會組織、商業份子、不過佔百分之二而已、除當地纏回外、平津晉綏各帮、僅十數家、營業貨品、不外副茶·紙烟·布匹·之類、又以金融影響、不能作固定之貿易、市面缺乏現金、省票漲落無定、因此促成貨品與原料交換之狀態、例如平津晉綏客帮、以茶磚·紙烟·綢緞·等貨、換取纏民之羊皮·羊毛·駝毛·瓜乾·葡萄乾等、商業重心、旣偏於互相交換　品、現金成交、遂漸趨於遲滯沉靜之狀、同時出入貨品之市價、亦日見增高矣、茲將本年九月份主要進出口貨物市價、列表如次、（以圓爲單位）</p>
<p>出口　駝毛　　二○·○○（每百斤）</p>
<p>羊毛　　一·四○（每百斤）</p>
<p>羔皮　　○·三○（每張）</p>
<p>棉花　　一六·○○（每百斤）</p>
<p>葡萄乾　二○·○○（每百斤）</p>
<p>狐皮　　四·○○（每張）</p>
<p>進口　磚茶　　二·二○（每塊）</p>
<p>副茶　　二·五○（每塊）</p>
<p>紙烟（哈德門）　　三·○○（每條）</p>
<p>糖　　　○·五○（每斤）</p>
<p>布（俄貨如印花布等類）○·一五（每檔計長二尺）</p>
<p>近月以來、因原料吸取將盡、貨品漸難成交、勢將復趨於現金交易之一途、故九月間省票、雖低至五百兩、（每元）現又回復至四百兩、同時上列進口貨品之價格、亦漸低落、但以交通阻塞、來源不易而觀、貨價之提高、省票之低落、仍爲哈密將來必見之現象、所幸者、最近新綏汽車、已可通至哈密、省方变擬與哈密通車、以啣接新綏路綫、則未來哈密之商業、必有相當發展也、</p>
<p>今有一事、亟須注意、卽對邊疆商業應如何以圖振展、我國商人素無組織、尤鮮遠大之計畫、對於邊疆營商、初不過藉此以博倍利、其原動力實出於自私自利、故此間商人嘗言、「如今的賣買、較從前趕大營（隨左宗棠軍爲賈）的差得多了、從前没人捐税、如今到處税卡、從前利獲十倍、如今嘗憂虧本、甚至倒閉、」聆其言、可知國商前途危機、實已日趨类鋭化、今邊疆市塲、日益開闢、最近近水樓臺之蘇聯、已有來哈設一國際貿易公司之成議、以無組織無計畫之國商、而與龐大資本嚴密組織之外商相角逐、其處劣敗也必矣、</p>
<p>（六）農村經濟　哈密面積雖廣、但可耕之地、不過佔百分之一而已、現有農村及可耕地、計東北區有沁城、芨芨臺、土葫蘆、淖毛湖、黄蘆崗、一棵樹、石城子、榆樹溝等地、西南區有頭二三四五各堡、及大小南湖等地、西北有一二三四五六七八九各道溝、與沙棗園等地、約計農民三千户、可耕地九萬餘畝、平均每户可種地三十畝、每石耕地、可播種二石、收穫二十石、每石計値省票七千兩、（合洋十七元五角）、除繳税百分之五（卽每石耕地收租麥八斗）外、常年收穫計値三百餘元、此間農民生活、實較他省爲優、負擔之輕、亦非他處可比、全縣雇農約佔農民總數百分之五、其待遇工資、如年工、在十年前每人三四十元、今票價陡跌、只合十元左右、惟供給膳食、或有併及幼兒及妻者、長工每月省票一千兩、（合洋二元半）短工每日一百兩、（合洋二角五分）皆供膳食、且有供衣者、農村生產、除大量之麥稞外、尙有牧畜一項、單以綿羊而言、年產約在二十萬頭、平均每户可畜羊七十頭、每羊價値四元五角、（羊毛年產四斤、共値洋五分、羊皮一張、値洋四角、羊腸一根、値洋一角、羊肉二十斤、値洋四元）</p>
<p>總計約値洋三百零五元、設用科學方法、善加經營、每年產額、當不止此、此外、如瓜乾駝毛、年產爲數亦多、故哈密農村社會、尙呈封建小康之狀、</p>
<p>哈密農村經濟之富源、爲（一）得天山雪水灌溉之利、天山東脈横亘縣境、常年積雪、至春夏融化時、其南流者爲渠水、凡可耕地無不受澤、其北流者爲草湖、水草豐美、宜於牧畜、最近哈薩之東遷、亦以天山北麓水草、可資生活也、（二）農村封建壁壘、尙未被資本主義勢力擊破、故在某種意義上、尙呈小康現象、蓋哈密纏回、多係土著、亦卽厄魯特族之一種、性和平、耐勞苦、男女均能從事勞作、且自阿貝都拉就王位後、傳至十餘世、民衆耕地、皆領自王府、而王府田地、又什九肥沃、（三）人口稀少、以哈密全面積計、平均每八十方里佔一人、人口之稀少、可謂極矣、至纏民生活之富庶、人口繁殖之遲緩、實係一反比例也、</p>
<p>（七）物產　哈密社會組織、旣以農業爲中心、故其主要生產、亦以農作物爲夥、全縣主要農產物、每年產額、計爲小麥十八萬石、哈密瓜二十三萬斤、羊皮二十萬張、羊毛一百萬斤、駝毛十五萬斤、此外如葡萄·蘋果·白菜·等類、均有出產、惟爲數不多、城西一百八十里三道嶺、原產煤礦、惜礦區卑濕、挖掘困難、當地民衆、隨時掘取、產量無正確統計、　　（八）回王之沿革組織及現狀　哈密回部札薩克雙親王、其始祖爲額貝都拉、（清康熙二十六年始封）一傳郭伯、次傳額敏、三傳玉案卜、四傳伊薩克、五傳額爾德錫爾、六傳伯錫爾、七傳邁哈莫特、八傳沙麻胡索特、九傳聶滋爾、十傳伯西爾、其組織爲臺基二人、管理軍政、克宰一人、掌理司法、密波拉二人、管理農村水利、都爾嘎二十四人、管理納賦完税、冒恥二十四人、管理事項與都爾嘎同、惟職權較小、受都爾嘎之指揮、榖落曼兒二十四人、爲冒恥之副手、當沙麻胡索特（卽今伯王之祖）在世時、與省方頗能合作、故其封建勢力、亦牢不可破、及金樹人主新省時、擬在哈密城北三百里之土葫蘆設宜吾縣、城西一百八十里之三堡設宜禾縣、合哈密爲三個縣治、曾着手清丈地畝、以爲設治之初步、計畫尙稱完善、祇以實行時屢有越軌之舉、致與回王封建制度發生衝突、而境内可耕沃地、又爲王族及臺基·都爾嘎等所有、因之二十年哈密類似農民革命之事件突起、一方面固爲王族官僚爭地產權之正面衝突、他方面、王族官僚、推波助瀾、且鼓動而成民族生存之競爭、錯綜混亂之局勢、迄今尙未完全安定、</p>
<p>現襲王位者、爲聶滋爾之子伯西爾、伯西爾年方弱冠、精神萎靡、族人多歧視之、其傳統的封建、現僅殘餘一息而已、况另</p>
<p>一面、纒族新興統治力、另已轉向他一方面、如現任省府副主席之和加尼亞子、哈鎭警備司令之堯樂傅士等、依此推測、王族專制、亦將「壽終正寢」矣、</p>
<h3>平市韓人不法遊行</h3>
<p>因當局禁毒懹恨警察</p>
<p>毆傷電車生公然示威</p>
<p>北平通信、故都禁毒政策、自嚴厲實施後、當局頗感困難者、卽緝捕販毒韓人問題是也、日警署方面、雖表面口稱與中國當局協力拘拿、而實際上、韓人仍得日人保護、近日韓人反抗檢查及不服中國警士逮捕之案、層出不窮、今（十八）日又出一離奇之韓人不法案、緣西直門内、後車兒胡同二十四號、住户韓人金鼎臣、其近鄰二十三號、住有段金玉者、係電車公司之售票生、韓人金某、常作販毒生涯、因鑒於近日韓人販毒被捕甚多、心中頗感不平、某日、忽見段某身着靑布制服回家、因誤認段係公安局警察、今（十八）日乃持木棍一條、在門前等候、恰値段下班回家、突由段之身後、用棍猛擊、正中段之頭部、當時鮮血直流、傷重倒地、經内四區巡官李松林救護、送往中央醫院診治、金見肇禍、不但不懼、竟約集無業韓人十餘名、赴西四大街義昌永酒店集合、旋卽列隊出發、在馬市大街羊市大街帥府胡同井兒胡同一帶、遊行示威、手持木棍、口出不遜、若故意尋釁者然、我方警察見狀、知不可以理喻、乃暗中跟隨、一方監視、一方與以和平之保護、此亦可見華北情勢之一斑矣、（十八日）</p>
<h3>戰區薊縣發現非法組織</h3>
<p>竟有所謂窮人黨</p>
<p>要求撤免各税捐</p>
<p>北平通信、薊縣最近突發現所謂「窮人黨」之非法組織、其黨中份子、除土棍地痞以及漢奸外、並有共黨羼雜、人數若</p>
<p>干、雖無確切統計、但據探悉約有四百餘人、其所揭之標幟、謂係「反對繳納任何捐賦」、並秘密派黨徒在北平傳逹消息、該非法組織、在昔因行動秘密、故尙少人知、最近始被該縣發覺、其經過情形、據薊縣電話稱、昨（十七）日下午三時許、突有自稱「窮人黨代表二人、到縣政府請願、要求撤底免征各項捐税、該縣縣長王</p>

<h3>交易所聯會推代表請願</h3>
<p>顧馨一穆藕初進京</p>
<p>昨晚已起程</p>
<p>交易所聯合會、爲請求中央暫緩徴收交易税、物再推顧馨一·穆藕初·二氏代表交易所聯合會、并携帶呈文、於昨晚十一時、搭夜快車赴京、晋謁中央當局、請求暫緩執行、原文如下、</p>
<p>交易所的三大職能　夫交易所在近代經濟組織中、有三大職能焉、曰構成價格、曰轉嫁危險、曰流通物資、蓋交易所爲繼續市塲之中心、集大量这需給、求相互之投合、决定適當之價格、以爲公定市價、</p>
<p>一爲構成買賣價格　此公定市價、直接可以爲物財交易關係者買賣價格之標凖、間接可以爲經濟界變動趨向之指針、但交易所公定</p>
<p>市價之漲落、即可以表示該貨物確實之需給、該證劵正確之信用、生產者受此市價之指導、可以預爲戒備、有供多於求之趨勢、則减其生產、有</p>
<p>求多於供之趨勢、則增其生產、使財物之供給、無過剩不足之弊、而後可以安然實行「市塲生產」、交易所受此市價之指導、可以知需給之底藴、而爲公平之買賣、投資者受此市價之指導、可以知所適從、捨短就長、而爲有益利殖之投資、不特此也、交易所有期貨之買賣、於是甲乙兩地之間、近遠兩時之中、供求若有參差、市價因而相異、則供多之處購進、求多之處售出、奏截長補短之功、收注彼挹此之效、而異時異地之供求、可以調劑異時異地之物價、亦可以平凖矣、此交易所在現代經濟組織中之所以爲價格構成機關、而我交易所法第十九條之所以有「交易所應决定公布市價而公告之」之規定也、</p>
<p>二爲危險轉嫁機關　考現代經濟組織之中、除勞力者與資本家二者之外、復有企業界之存在、企業家、乃以自己之計劃而經營事業者、同時亦即自己負担企業經營之危險者也、故企業欲求其發逹、則因企業所受之危險、不得不設法以求其减低爲最小限度、近代交易所之運用、有大量需給之存在、有定期交易之方法、有投機買賣者之參考、於是企業家因生產而發生之未來危機、即可以藉海琴Ｈｅｇｉｎｇ買賣、（套做買賣）而轉嫁之於投機者、蓋一切生產事業、購進原料與製出產品之間、大都相距若干時日、而此相距時日之中、供求當有變化、市價不無漲落、惟知原料價格與製品價格、大都呈一致騰跌、故於原料購進之同時、即可以在交易所預爲出貨同月期之原料及製品之抛售、如是、若此後市價上騰、則失之於交易所者、可以得之於原料進貨上者補之、若今後市價下落、則失之於原料進貨上者、可以得之於交易所者償之、海琴買賣之結果、於是企業家生產上所受之危險、可由交易所中投機者負担之、而生產者可以安然於生產矣、此交易所在現代經濟組織中之所以爲危險轉嫁機關也、</p>
<p>三爲物質流通機關　今日市塲之生產、大都皆爲股份之累積、故一生產品之買賣、一公司股份之募集、必須有一集中機關以聚其需供、否則買賣散居四方、資不往來無定、投合旣不易、成交尤困難、擁巨資者不知從何購進、不知從何投資、即幸有媒介人之周旋、而價格之商訂、品質信用之鑒别、契約條件之履行、亦未必確實可恃、交易所成立、大量之需給集中、買賣擋保之制度確立、隨時可以行隨量之成交、價格公平、等級分明、信用昭著手續旣極簡單、交易因以便利、物財之　受易、而資本之流通順矣、此交易所在現代經濟組織中之所以爲物資流通機關也、交易所在現代社會中、旣具有如是之經濟職能、而在我國現狀之下、尤不可漠視、今日我國大量这產品、如棉·如紗·如糧食·受外人傾軋、而銷路短縮者、不一而足、各業有交易所之組織、則本業之主人、主本業之事、消息靈通、時機不致坐失、規劃周密、市况得以保持、實權在各本業手中、即不致爲外人所操縱矣、此交易所在中國現狀之下、又一職能、故交易所在我國之目前、爲經濟發展計、爲挽救不景氣計、爲與外人競爭計、實有扶植其日趨滋長之必要、</p>
<p>交易所徴税後弊害　我國正式交易所之成立、創自民七以後、經民十之風潮、基礎始漸臻穏固、十餘年來、慘淡經營、遂造成今日之局面、而盡其應盡之職責、今我政府對交易所徴收交易税在學理上言、事屬當然、商人對之、豈敢獨持異議、不過事實上、在今日我國現狀之下、實行交易税之徴收、其問題不在於徴税法意之是否、而可慮者乃在於附隨弊害之如何、交易所一旦徴税、經紀人爲自身之利益計、必出下列二途、其一、經紀人爲目前之利益計、轉嫁其負担於委託者、而提高買賣經手費、其二、經紀人爲未來这利益計、自忍一時負担、維持原有經手費率、以延攬買賣之委託、此二者之中、必居其一、茲先自經紀人提高買賣經手費之結果、以推論其應處之　、</p>
<p>買賣經手費提高後　買賣經手費提高以後、其直接之結果、必影響及於買賣之减退、在商業蕭條、市况衰沉之今日、此買賣之减退、尤爲必然發生之事實、交易所亦必將因此而導入于停滯狀態之中、夫交易怕之職能、已如前述、基現代經濟組織之作用、正如人體之心臟、全身血脈入於心、然後週流全體、發而爲力、今若心臟减少效能、則全身將受其害、交易怕停滯之結果、其弊正同於此、而使蕭條之商况、將愈形沉悶、停滯之物資、將益形停滯矣、此不可不慮者一也、今日我證劵市塲中最大之交易、厥爲國債</p>
<p>、近數年來財政支絀、故國庫調度、端賴募債、如國債買賣亦徴收交易税、則今後之結果、必至於舊債停滯、而新債之發行尤難、此不可不慮者二也、且國難期間、百端待舉、年來各省方努力於建設、而建設之物資、又端賴募債劵以充當、而此種公債之募集、最善莫若於證募市塲中舉行之、各省之地方債、以今後之趨勢而言、在最近將來、必有開拍之一日、今交易所買賣經費增加則買賣不易、間接所以杜塞省債發行之路、此不可不慮者三也、我國證劵市塲、向少股票之上塲、近一二年來、在上海雖有一二十種已開始買賣、但爲數尙屬有限、今日中國之企業、雖因種種内在之原因、未見發逹、但今後中國之經濟、究屬方興未艾、企業之發逹、自爲意料中事、今交易所買賣上多一種障礙、則股票之授受、即多一種困難、於是已成之企業、難期發展、未成之企業、難期產生矣、此不可不慮者四也、我國國產工業興於歐戰方酣之際、就中最著者、厥爲棉紗麵粉、而此兩者之產品、皆爲我民生上所一日不可缺乏者、詎知世界經濟恐慌發生以後、各國過剩產品、潮擁而來、東鄰日本、其勢尤猛、諸如紗布花粉之屬、莫不以最低廉之價格、與我國產相競爭、資力薄者、已相繼傾覆、資力稍厚者、亦已陷入最後之一息、今若流通物財之商品交易所、再增一重障礙、則此最後一息之廠家、恐亦將不終朝而消减、而予國產工業以極大之打擊、此不可不慮者五也、</p>
<p>維持經紀人經手費　經紀人提高買賣經手費之結果、一如上述、茲再自經紀人維持目前經手費推論其可慮之點、今日事實上各交易所經紀人、對委託者所收之經手費、以市况蕭條、往往已較定額爲低、今若再多一層交易税之負擔、必將隨之而發生、最可慮者、恐因此而促起交易所内不法之「外轉」買賣也、外轉買賣者、即不經過交易所市塲、而私自以交易所市價舉行之買賣、外轉有二種、其一爲甲經紀人對乙經紀人之外轉、其二爲甲乙兩委託者在同一經紀人處之外轉、外轉爲不法之行爲、而被嚴禁於交易所法、（第三十八條）然而利之所在、又以損失加多之不昨已原因、枉法亦怕難免、外轉之結果、不特買賣失交易所之保障、而買賣旣不經交易所、交易怕亦無以知經紀人之買賣額、於是一方面可以漏交易、他方面外轉過多、則交易所收佣金額减低、盈利减低、於是交易所原有按盈利繳納之營業税、亦將因以大减、而害及於國庫之收入、至此、政府得於此（交易税）而失於彼（營業税）、豈非仍無補於財政耶、此不可不慮者一也、退一步言、即令經紀人忍受損失、則在目前之暫時、或可勉强勾延、然而日久以後損失日積、必將影響於交易所之生存問題、不幸而不受我法</p>
<p>律统制之日人「取引所」又乘機崛起、故意擾亂、則我國交易所、勢非全部停業不可、若竟至此地步、則我國產品之價格、自又不能不聴命於外人、十餘年爭得之交易所、復再拱手讓人、天下最痛心者、寗有逾於此耶、此不可不慮者又一也、綜上所述、交易税之徴收、在理論上雖無可</p>
<p>訾議、但施行上恐多困難、惟受税率鄭重研究、務使前述之弊害可以减低至最小限度、否則徴税之成效未見、經濟之危機即發、此非我政府原有徴税之用意、故與其敗於終、毋寗愼於始、商人等不敏、僅陳所見、以爲我政府施政之一助、斷不敢故作危辭、以聳聴聞也、</p>

<h3>今年華棉產量大增</h3>
<p>中日紗廠採用逹五十餘萬包</p>
<p>今年我國棉花產量、據可靠統計、已逹十一萬餘包、較去年納增加百分之十以上、因此國棉在國内市塲、竟占重要地位、同時美國印度等外棉、乃大受排擠、至於國棉銷售數量、較往年亦有增加、僅就上海一處而論、中日紗廠所用原棉泰半俱係國產、其他美印等外棉之銷路、已大不如前、茲將各種數字、列表於次、以資比較、</p>
<p>上海中日紗廠買進原棉之數量表</p>
<p>種類　　　一九三三年　　　　一九三四年</p>
<p>中國棉　　四四三·七二七　　五一三·八二六</p>
<p>天津美棉　一二·二三○　　　一七·八七六</p>
<p>山東棉　　一七·五○八　　　一三·三四六</p>
<p>米棉　　　一一七·八二七　　四七·六○○</p>
<p>印棉　　　一二五·八五○　　六三·○二六</p>
<p>埃及棉　　一○·二五○　　　五·九○○</p>
<p>合計　　　六九七·六五二　　六三○·三五四</p>
<p>就上表觀之、今年（尙有十二月之下半月尙未計入）上海中日各紗廠所買棉花、其總數雖較去年略低、但各國原棉所占百分比、當首推國棉爲第一、蓋全部需要總數六十三萬包中、我國棉花竟占五十一萬三千餘包、卽百分之七十五强、其他美印埃等出品、竟大减特减、卽美棉較去年慘跌百分之六十、印棉約减去半數、埃及亦與印度相似、今年國棉、旣如此進展、如能繼續下去、則一切外棉、勢將放棄在華地位無疑矣、</p>
<h3>中國廠聯會籌建</h3>

<p>新新社云、本市西藏路永吉里中華國產廠商聯合會主辦之滬南國貨展覽會、自發起以來、積極進行、不遺餘力、該會因預定明年元旦開幕、爲期甚促、爰於昨日先行丈量會塲面積、以便計劃興建塲位、昨通告會員廠商聲明滬南國貨展覽會、並未與中華國貨恊會合辦舉行、茲探誌各節如次、</p>
<p>會塲計劃　據該會常委劉仲英談、該展覽會會塲、已借定十六舗恒興里口之空地、約計二百五十方丈、擬建築竹棚一百二十間、每間深寛估一方丈、會塲正門闢於裏馬路及外馬路兩處、塲内中央闢人行道四條、闊一丈二尺、四週則周轉圍合、可通裏外馬路、正門及塲内中央各部之人行道一條、闊一丈六尺、使來賓參觀者可繞塲巡行、不致錯亂、會塲内部闢一陳列部、均用木架玻璃橱窗陳列各廠出品、在陳列部之中央附設講演臺、每日聘請專家講演國貨學説、辦公處即設於陳列部之北部、消防及公隊、則設於北部大門口、斱内各處、並由該會會員工廠中華實業社、遍懸滅火機、俾補消防隊之不足、而保萬全、至各項工程、業於昨日丈量繪圖、一面呈請工務局頒發執照、一面即與工建築塲位云、</p>
<p>通告聲明　爲通告事、案查本會此次舉行滬南國貨展覽會、業經呈請市黨部社會局依法備案、並已積極進行、開始籌備、乃忽據昨日豐昶襪廠等來會稱、謂有中華國貨恊會、用已向該廠等收取塲費、因近聞本會已在進行籌辦、（滬南國貨展覽會）爰特到會叩訊眞相云云、據此、查本會歷届舉行國貨展覽會、除外埠由各地主管機關恊助辦理外、從未與任何團體連合舉行、至此次在滬南舉行展覽國貨、完全由本會單獨主持辦理、對中華國貨恊會合辦之説、當屬有人在外招謠、别具作用、本會除當向豐昶襪廠等聲明外、誠恐各會員不明眞相、被其欺朦、用特鄭重聲明、希各知照、特此通告、</p>
<h3>泰豐公司停業</h3>
<p>係受華明火柴廠拖累</p>
<p>國聞社云、泰豐罐頭食品有限公司、自開設本埠、迄二十九載、除南京路總店及批發所外、另於小沙渡一五零一弄、自設廠房、爲製造之所、茲該公司受華明興記火柴公司拖累、已於前日聘請徐永祚會計師查人偉張正學律師、宣告停業、茲將詳情彙誌如次、</p>
<p>泰豐歷史　泰豐公司中一切事宜、統由董事鄧瑞人·黄楚珍·唐應華·唐耀堅·李崇焜·五人負責　、總經理爲王拔如·副費楚珍·製造廠長爲鄧瑞人、最初創辦時資本祇十萬元、嗣以營業發逹、兩度增益資本十萬、至今共有資本三十萬元、</p>
<p>營業狀况　該公司總店設南京路二五五號、有職員九十餘名、批發所則附設於總店内、小沙渡路製造廠位於蘇州河畔、計有工人一百三十餘名、加以廠内高級辦事職員、共約二百四五十人、製造廠分機器餅乾肉食白鐵四部、自昨日起、已停止製造、廠門前貼有會計師律師會銜布告、工人大半屬粤籍、在廠工作時間、有多至十餘年、有數人已逹二十年以上、</p>
<p>清理原因　記者據總店人員談、泰豐歷年均有盈餘、此次停業、事出突然、完全係被華明火柴公司拖累、至於華明開設於江灣體育會路、初創資本三萬元、嗣以虧蝕關係、增至五萬元、嗣營業又不佳、再行增添資本至八萬元、幾度改組、至今共有資本十餘萬元、經理蘇豫朋·副理蔡克明·失敗最大原因、不久以前、華明因印花税問題涉訟、所耗不貲、華明營業失敗之下、引起泰豐經濟不能週轉、而驟告停業也、</p>
<p>會商善後　董事方面、昨會召集會議、華明一切資財、現盡由泰豐保管中、總計應欠泰豐賬目在四十餘萬以上、苟能立時將華明出盤、得償還泰豐、而泰豐仍可開業、不過目下正在清理、况出盤不易、卽泰豐欲整旗鼓、亦須假時日云云、（所有會計師律師布告已見廣告不再另錄）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　貧女不能差任敎平視西賓何足貴空辱虚心</p>
<p>賈多才笑道··你能説這小傢伙是客嗎？外國人要來的話，我立刻就轟他跑。但有知這兩個外國人究竟有什麽事。李士廉道··西洋人的習慣，是和中國人不同的。他們不會講那無味的應酬，旣要來，一定有目的。據我想，他們必定是問問你西北的情形，作一種考察的資料。賈多才道··我料着必是把我當個學者，訪問西北經濟情形。他們歐美人眞是厲害，就我這樣一個平常的銀行家，他也不能放過。好罷，你約他等一個鐘頭之後才來。讓我坐在屋子裏靜靜的想一想，應當怎樣的措詞。關於陜西的棉花出產，我有一個統系的調查，這件事我可以供獻給他。李士廉道好，我給你去回信。我看他們拜訪你，倒是有那分誠心。就是等一個鐘頭，他們也會來的。賈多才正色道··他來不來没有關係，我總要考慮一下，才能接見他，你要知道，這是和國體有關的事情，總希望在我們口裏，不要閙出什麽笑話去。李士廉本覺得外國人特地來拜會，不能没有原故，再經賈多和這態度一點綴，越覺得不同平常，連説是是的去了。賈多才回到屋子裏來，立刻各胡嫂子揮着手道··你們去罷，我這裏有外國人來。胡嫂子道··是鬼子嗎？賈多才再揮着手道··去罷去罷，有什麽話，我們回頭再説罷。月英在這屋子裏受了幾十分鐘的考試，本也就委屈到所以然，旣是賈老爺這樣的轟人走路，算是他開了一條生路，還在這裏坐着作什麽？他首先站起來，就向門外走，胡嫂子也跟着去了。（九五）</p>
<h3>文壇佳話</h3>
<p>— 殺羽</p>
<p>紅豆想思　爲了那首「紅豆生南國，此物最相思」的红豆詩··「紅豆」就成了文壇上的雅物了。歷來詠紅豆的詩詞，指不勝屈，像唐代詩人温庭筠的「玲瓏骰子安紅豆，入骨相思知未知」？都是和王維一般借來譬喻相思的。清代錢牧齊先生，他書齊前有着一棵紅豆樹，就名他的書齊呌做「紅豆山莊。」錢先生是一代大儒，於是常熟的紅豆，就名騰南國，見重當世了。其實安徽，廣東諸省，都有產生··就是蘇州隷屬的洞庭西山，也生着兩棵紅豆樹。紅豆的種類，安徽主薄山上出產的，最爲可愛，那豆约有黄荳大小，腰圓形，顏色鮮紅，佩之愈久，愈見光明，寒雲主人，曾送給兪逸芬尊翁兩粒，就是此項紅豆。常熟的紅豆，雖因人而名，可是他的形態約有圍棋大小，並不粒粒圓潤，顏色也有紅有黑。同文兪友清君，因今歲常熟紅豆出產較多，特地收集了托商店代售，於是引起了幾個藏着紅豆的人反對，以爲兪君將相思子，當做貨物出賣，太覺辱没雅物，據兪君説··他的出賣紅豆，原係爲輯「紅豆詩集」徴集基金，然而蘇州報紙上已引起小小爭端了。</p>
<p>芳草美人　文人畢竟是多情種子，自從三閭大夫屈靈均的離騷創造了個芳草美人的名詞，一班文人，都皅他們的綿綿情思，寄托在名花芳草上。像陶靖節的愛菊，周敦頤的愛蓮，都是流芳後世盡人皆知的，現代文人愛花的，像胡石予先生的愛梅花，程瞻廬先生的愛臘梅，本刊編者周先生的愛紫羅蘭，也可算得是文壇上一重佳話吧。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （紅霞）</p>
<p>據國際貿易局統計，本年十個有來，脂粉香水進口，總値國幣一百四十五萬一千七百八十八元，較去年同期增二萬四千元，這數字，是多麽的驚人，若以十個月去分這筆巨欵，每日平均應有四千八百三十九元二角九分，這筆錢，完全是在婦女們一點一滴的脂粉香水中消耗掉，女同胞們，請你們不要渺視這點滴的脂粉香水呀！</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>萬一到那時候我們發現你的行爲並没有改善，那末你的第二條尾巴便又得割下來了丨這狐狸很高興地答應了，聲明它自己也已覺悟，願意竭力的去改過自新。可是回去之後，一千年工夫很快地又過了，它的行爲却依然是非常惡劣祇不過在已往的一千年中，它始終不曾喝醉過一次；但是他的種種惡習慣，兀自不斷的在搬演着，而且是劣跡昭彰，無論它怎樣狡猾，也抵賴不掉。玉帝當然是早知道了，便立卽把它抓來，又給它割掉了一條尾巴··同時仍希望它能够改過，便照上次的辦法，再寛限它一千年，讓它慢慢地革面自亲。這狐狸也痛哭流涕的應承了。可是回去之後。不久便本性復發，恣意的爲非作惡。貶貶眼第二個千年又過了，玉帝細細替它檢查起來，除掉不曾喝過酒，不曾説過謊之外，依然是一無善狀；它這樣的怙惡不悛，不用説是很使玉帝失望的，便决意繼續懲罰它。好在它還有七條尾巴咧丨於是每隔一千年後考核它一次，每次考核的結果，總是不能滿意，便每次割掉它一支尾巴；待到八千年之後，這狐狸已僅餘一根的尾巴了，然而它的行爲還是不能盡善盡美。照玉帝的意思，它這一支最後的尾巴也决不能讓它保留了，因此又把它抓了去，告訴它不能再寛恕了，這一次爲撤除综的惡根起見，必須把它最後的一支尾巴也割下來··也許這樣的處置，才能够使它變爲一頭善良安分的狐狸。（二○五）</p>
<h3>悼李石岑先生</h3>
<p>— 周錚</p>
<p>李先生的死，學術界當然受了一個重大的損失。在這學者寥落的中國，尤其値得我們痛惜。李先生是一位哲學家，他首先擁護尼采的學説，隨後又經過幾次的轉變，但他是始終追求着眞理的。他認爲要解脱苦難，先該能忍受苦痛，所以他不斷地沈着向上。</p>
<p>當然啦，在學者商品化的時代，排擠，妬視，他就免不了受人家攻擊和漫駡。他正像一支白燭，純潔地燃燒着自己的生命，在電火式的光亮下，似乎現不出他本身的光明和偉大，但我深信一時的雲霧，是掩不了清朗的長空。</p>
<p>他講授課程，雖不點名，但没有一次不滿座，且常有得不到坐位而立着聽講的。或者坐到講臺講桌旁去的。他那誠摯的態度和談吐，彷佛便是眞理的替身。任何人都要受他感化的。但他决没有詭辯家的欺詐，有的是純學者的風度。在憂鬱和經濟夾攻之下，一位學界完人，是犠牲了。遺留給我們的，是一個熱情，無限强烈的眞理的力。我們該掃除一般學術販子，繼承李先生爲學的精神</p>
<h3>上帝的傑作</h3>
<p>— 月</p>
<h3>鐵樹</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>「這是鐵樹，現在看起來雖然像是一節枯木，但將來是會發芽的。」去年的時候，有一天朋友送來一樣物件，這樣的對我说。</p>
<p>我隨聲謝了他，把他送給我的東西接過來？這是一段锯下來的枯樹，栽在一個磁盆裏面。</p>
<p>「鐵樹？枯死了的木材還能發芽？」我聽了朋友的話，心裏很懹疑，隨手把它放在屋角。</p>
<p>以後，我還時時給它澆着水，但它却没有一點發芽的動靜。</p>
<p>今年的春天，我把它由盆裏移植到小園裏，意思使它多得一點天然的雨露；可是它仍然是死寂寂地，我對於它的發芽的希望差不多完全斷絶了丨</p>
<p>突然，在夏天的一個朝晨，我無意中發現這段枯木的旁邊，透出來一個嫩芽，我當時驚喜得呌了出來··「鐵樹到底能復活喲丨···」</p>
<p>現在，這嫩芽已經漸漸地長成一株小樹，它那綠油油的葉子雖然在這寒天烈風裏，依然是一樣的繁茂。</p>
<p>「對於世界上的一切是不可絶望的。」我想。</p>
<p>這復活的鐵樹給了我「人生須有堅硬力量」的啟示，這鐵樹給了我「人生須要奮鬭到底」的象徴。</p>

<h3>程瑤笙與胡適之</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>老畫師程瑤笙先生，近以遺棄一案，喧傳社會，先生曩時掌敎吳中草橋中學，予曾沐其敎益，一昨乃往訪之。先生狀殊龍鍾，雙目失明，客至必須自呼其名，始得辨爲某某。予至，先生頗欣喜，因述及訟事，謂老境頽唐，復遇此意外風波，搆罪狀於子虚烏有中，洵令人夢想不到者也。總之平日抱福不獨享主義，以爲得天獨厚，當分畀於人，而不察者以爲豐赡有餘，擁資巨萬，於是加以覬觎。實則處境貧乏，近年尤甚，故生平食無二葷之列，出無自備之車，即所用一切器具，均從北京路廉値購來，雜凑不整。視之凳敝桌破，凌亂交横，果絶無華貴之品，最可笑者，畫几一端足尙完好，一端已付闕如，則以二煤油木箱直立墊之，几上置有時代過去之撮影多幀，鴻雪留痕，良堪紀念，偶注意之，則爲中國新公學師生同樂圖。而今日之文壇巨子胡適之在焉，蓋瑤笙先生與之同校有年，深相契合者，適之更親筆題詩一律，以贈瑤笙先生，予乃走鉛錄之云··「也知吳越同舟誼，無奈驚濤動地來，江上飛烏猶繞樹，尊前殘蝶已成灰，曇花隠現空餘恨，鴻爪遺留亦可哀，莫漫勞勞作芻狗，且論氣味到岑苔」。其時適之尙未從事新文化，故所作猶存尖义韻味也。</p>
<h3>梅屋莊吉</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>十一月二十日本報載着「日聯電東京的一段通訊」説··與「中國革命有密切關係之日人梅屋莊吉翁，患胃潰瘍。在千葉縣别莊療養中，至二十三日逝世；梅屋氏爲長崎人二十三歲時赴滬，與孫文及其他中國革命之要人交際，對於中國革命事業，頗有功績」云··這一段歷史，現在梅屋已去塵世，恐怕能得知其一二的，是很少數了。故我來寫幾句在下··　　大約在五年前吧丨梅屋曾經携所鑄的總理遺像，和他的眷屬，從日本到吾們中國，併親赴首都謁靈，他不惜遠道奔馳，耗費鉅萬，而且出自個人的行動，初起，大家有些奇怪，這件事，或許還有人記着哩！不曉得梅屋，實在是個中山先生的老朋友，從前史記上説··「一生一死，乃見交情」，日本人近來吾們中國對他，無論那一個，不會有好感，然而梅屋一人，吾以爲不可不知道他的義膽俠腸，就是他和中山先生，在海外交際的時候，恐怕祇有這一人呢！</p>
<p>梅屋大約在明治二十七八年間，先在香港中環大馬路八號，開了一所照相館，他的店號，就呌「梅谷」。後來經西人康德黎介紹，遂和中山先生訂交，而中山先生對他，也甚莫逆，朝夕叙首，有時談至深夜，就宿在梅屋處；你想知己不知己？中山先生蒙難到倫敦，梅屋雖在香港，還時時託一個牧師，名呌歐逢時的，暗地裏代遞消息，得到中山先生不知下落的驚耗，他又想法探其踪跡，并代爲預備逃避日本的地步；所以當時平山周，宮崎寅藏（即白浪滔天）等，都得和中山先生相識，就是民黨中的先進，像犬養毅一流人物，也十分信仰總理，都可説是梅屋一人鼓吹的力量。</p>
<p>中山先生先聽陳少白的意思，欲避至台灣，梅屋回日，大爲不可，以爲「台地屬滿清，安全不如日本」，所以中山先生就以中山侯爵邸第爲庽廬，自稱爲「中山」，從此定名。其時適</p>
<p>當吾國戊戌政變以後，康梁亦逃往日本，梅屋誤以爲同是革命，可結同志，不到幾時，梅屋在中山先生面前自悔識人的不易；這許多説話，我還記得中山先生在滬上某處演説，曾經親自講過，如今看見報上梅屋逝世的紀載，就做了這一篇。</p>

<h3>批評家的資格</h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>我們看過許多關於批評的文章，牠們都有能説是没有理由的。比方説，批評要正確，批評家要公正，等等。然而，對於批評家的生活的實踐，好像不大有人着重地指出來似的。其實，這一點正是批評致命的要素。</p>
<p>作家應該有深刻的生活的實踐，批評家也同樣地不能例外。倘若他跟生活的實踐游離，他就無從理解表現在作品里的生活。他也許會引經據典，作成皇皇的批評大文，但這種批評（倘若可以稱爲批評的話），是和作家及讀者風馬牛不相及的。因爲他只能憑自己的獗隘的主觀，容易引起錯誤的淺見。</p>
<p>固然，批評家非有廣博的藝術理論的體得不可，但作爲他的世界觀的基石，他還應該通曉社會科學甚至自然科學，把握到正確的方法論。藝術的批評，是在分析作品中所反映的現實之眞實的程度，解明作者的意識，作者對於社會，對於人生的態度，由此附與作品以社會的評價。藝術家藉形象構成作品，批評家則藉論理分析作品。這里批評家用以表現思想的工具，是和科學相同的，並且批評家分析作品時，總要涉論及社會諸問題。所以社會科學以至自然科學，是批評家必要的基本知識。在這一基礎上，再去建立批評的特殊的知識。</p>
<p>然而，正像單有技術的修養，並不能成爲眞正的作家一樣，單有理論的修養，也不能成爲批評家。他們還須有深刻的生活的實踐，因爲只有在生活的實踐中，他們才能認識現實。批評受作家嘲笑，一方面是因爲在現在的社會，「公平」云者，並不是絶對的而是相對的，在大多數人是公平，在少數特權者就不是公平。所以現在的批評，只有受大多數人歡迎而受少數人嘲笑，或受大多數人嘲笑而受少數人歡迎的兩主流在。另一方面，批評家缺乏生活實踐的經騐，没有正確的認識，也是使批評受嘲笑的要因。在這里批評的理論變成敎條，變成憲法，批評家變成空頭的司令。</p>
<p>眞正的批評家，兼有正確的理論知識，和深刻的生活經騐，他能洞知作家的創作過程，洞知生活的一切。他能具體地帮助作家完成偉大的作品。世上最大的錯誤，就是我們自己犯了而不自知的錯誤，批評家負有指示作家的疎忽，困難，錯誤的所在。這樣，創作因批評而充實，批評也將因創作而豐富了吧。</p>
<p>要有這樣的「資格」的人，才能算作「批評家」。</p>
<h3>水的浪費</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>回到故鄉去，才知道今年的災荒遠比所知道的嚴重。就我們的小村鎭説，左近的田地是被稱爲水旱無憂的，但也因爲素稱十足的好田，其理想的標準是要每畝收四五石榖，這標準我們從來没見逹到過，歷年就總聽説今年收成不好。今年的災荒雖是頗普遍的，但我們那裏素來不曾感到旱災的威脅過，地位是在江邊，有潮水可以利用，今年的潮又不小，依理是不應感到水的缺乏。那末聽説的收成不好，仍是和老話一樣吧。</p>
<p>猜想也并不十分錯，就較大的範圍説，鄰近的所謂潮鄉，圩裏，往年不斷感着水的威脅，依土堤爲生命的地方，今年都開堤引水，而灌漑得很好，收成差不多十足丨丨他們的標準本來就低些。但我們那小地方，主要的田地不在江邊，而在一條小河的兩岸。近河口二三里的地方，河岸差不多和高潮平，再上二三里，高潮逹半河，再以上，潮不能到，但河在小山的溪谷裏，通常在雪融後或幾番春雨之後，山水就可以積到滿河。本來一段段都有土壩，以備蓄水，可是用得着的時候很少，幾年來都是多水，往往因爲本來蓄了水，而一時山水忽來，流洩不及而反損害了田地。壩的功用於是逐漸被人忘記，而壩也逐漸被山水冲毁而只剩殘跡，泥土隨河道向江裏流去，有些中途沈澱，有些流到河口而又被潮水擁回，息在河口，眞流到江裏去的爲量很少。於是河身日高，河口日淤，潮來雖仍有不少水，潮去却完全退盡。潮來時不打算盤，潮去了再等半月，半月後大家取水了，而取水的人力與工具都不够支配，榖物却奈不行再等半月了。於是坐待荒年。</p>
<p>爲了今年的敎訓，地方人也想起修整河道來，除預備掘深一點外、還是築壩。這决定現在還未實行，恐怕躭濶到明年，而明年又是水年時，這提議要終於烟消雲散了。在平均全年過一千公厘的地方，蓄水的問題的被忽略是很自名的。事實上不忽略也無辦法，如預備蓄水而不知什麽是根本辦法，僅依照旱地蓄水的方法，在雨水均衡的時候實在覺得是贅疣。</p>
<p>故鄉的一條小河，自然是很小的問題，可是類推下去，更大的河流乃至長江尼羅河的情形，也都彷彿。通常都只恐河中的水流之不速，汎濫時都只嫌下游的蓄水的湖沼的不廣，從不想到上面的來源會斷絶，因之從不顧到莫讓水源發洩盡磬。在英國人未造尼羅河大潭閘之前，埃及人是從不以大水的汎濫爲可抗拒，從不覺得流去過多的水是浪費，而這些過剩的水本可引作别的用塲。</p>
<p>固然尼羅河樣的工程，不一定能施之於長江，而我們家鄉那樣的小河，也許連施最小的工程也不値得。然其間可採取相似辦法的一定不少。要實際指出那一條來説，我没有這樣的知識，但設想如果大别山上有蓄水潭，洪澤總可减少汎濫，而上游可多收灌漑之利吧。又如以雲南與陜西比，陜西如有滇海那樣的高原湖沼，當可不致屢旱。天然的雖没有，用人爲的補救，似并非不可能的。</p>
<p>似乎結果説來是老話一句，事在人爲，而現在多數河道先已失修，就是因人的不爲而起，只要重做起來，無論就那一方面做起，都只有好些。但我想上流的水該是較基本與便利的辦法。</p>
<h3>從火山歸來（一）</h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>秋之神珊珊地來到人間，正是我離國温暖的南國的時候，如今眼看到牠要悄悄地去了，我心裏感到無限的悽愴與惆悵。我咀咒冬天，道凍死人的惡魔，一來到人間，凄厲的北風，滂沱的淫雨，陰森，黑暗一切都隨着來了。</p>
<p>秋天在日本是美麗的，看紅葉的少男少女，詩人墨客，也許比看樱花的還要多。我這回雖没有看到紅葉，友人笑我未免辜負了秋天。然而我覺得不但没有辜負牠，而且我整個地佔有了牠。雖然只有短短地一天的功夫，在我看來人間的秋之美景都被我一個人欣賞盡了。</p>
<p>自從聽到秦先生提議去三原火山旅行。我幾乎興奮得一晚没有睡。我想，即使是一毛錢也没有，我也要向友人借貸去旅行這一次。如果是日光箱根不去毫無關係，倒是這有名情死處的火山，非去探險一次不可。我趁求好幾位友人同我去，她們都用驚異和警告的語氣回答我··</p>
<p>「危險呵！那裏是不能去的！」新認識的幾位日本朋友，她們聽到我要旅行去原山誰都吐出舌頭來説··「危險喲！你不要和我們告别吧！」</p>
<p>然而我終於去了。</p>
<h3>誰是去Ｓａｙａｕｎａｒａ的。（注）</h3>
<p>十一月十號的晚上八點半鐘，我們一行七個人來到了靈岸島，秦先生代我們買船票去了，我們都站在候船室觀察每個旅客的臉色。</p>
<p>「看吧，我們來猜一猜這裏面有誰是去丨丨Ｓａｙａｕｎａｒａ的。」經　君一提醒，我們對於每個旅客的表情，説話的聲音，更注意，更看得仔細了。</p>
<p>船就靠在候船室的門外，門一開，大家就按着原來站的秩序上了船。這對於我，似乎是個新的發現，我忘記了這是島，像鄉里人初次來都會似的心裏感到驚訝··爲什麽船可以上陸呢？</p>
<p>因爲我們來的比較晚，站在後面，所以好的艙位全給走在前面的佔去了，我們擠在船尾的統艙裏，每人只有一尺寛的地方躺下。</p>
<p>船是九點鐘開的，聽説要次早四點半才能抵大島，這漫漫的長夜眞有點害怕；海風很大，　　我們又没有帶毡子，本來可以在船上花兩毛錢租一條的，但今天因爲遊人特别多，所以毡子也租不到，其實冷還可以脱下衣服來當被蓋，只有人靠人的擁擠眞是我有生以來没有經過的。兩邊都是日本人，只有我和楊女士是中國人。她們緊緊的擠着我們，有時竟把脚擱在我們的身上，我拚命地踢開，過一下她又來了。</p>
<h3>天橋</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>電車軌道停在廣塲的中間，兩面儘是些布幕與地攤，只留着幾條讓人穿梭的人行道。</p>
<p>用自己的脚搬來或是由電車洋車上跨下來，大約坐汽車的人的足跡是不會在這裏出現的，在這裏，你眞要覺得中國人口的繁盛，人的聲音更帮助你的眼睛，使你覺得這裏是萬花撩亂，人像花間的蜜蜂一樣吸取了花蜜有算，還要嗡嗡地喘息着。</p>
<p>小販的呌賣；</p>
<p>「賤賣啦，六隻碟子半塊錢，兩堆一塊錢！」</p>
<p>「洋花標，一元買兩丈！」</p>
<p>聽得是那麽得勁，唸成調兒，翻來覆去地唱，漲着太陽穴上的靑筋。何不以在那些靈巧的小玩藝上找到日本貨的商標，好在如今是檢查日貨的熱浪已經過去，買的人與賣的人心照不宣。倒是在陽光下晃着亮光的銅錫器却是道地的中國貨哩，老婆婆的在那裏挑着香爐蠟釺，有茶癮的老頭兒們疑視着紫銅茶壼摸着袋子裏的毛錢。</p>
<p>估衣莊裏，在徒弟們的邊唱邊笑下掀動着舊棉襖破棉被，冬天到了，從當舗裏贖不回什麽的漢子們來抄着這類攤兒，他們小心地還着價碼··</p>
<p>「太貴太貴，面子裏完全黄黑了哪，裏面的棉花不定怎麽着…」</p>
<p>「可以拆給你看，價錢屬咱們頂公道。」小夥計見有人問訊興奮着，最怕的是那些看一看搖搖頭便走了的情景。</p>
<p>相面先生的桌前掛着一個人臉，上面像地圖一樣在耳眼鼻唇的各部塡着字兒，發楞去抛錢的人已很頹少，人們是慢慢地把金錢盡了它更實在的用途。十六枚可以買一個褐色的乾餅哩！</p>
<p>紥着褲腿的女人在紙花攤前逗留，還有抹了一臉脂粉穿着紅綠袍的新嫁娘們也在逛大橋，低着聲音問這問那，水夫來潑土道時慌張地躱開，穿着玫瑰紅的繡花鞋呢。</p>
<p>雜耍攤上圍滿了看十八變的玩藝兒，不幸起來被逼着丢一大枚，機靈點的看半截溜了。那些能説能跳江湖好漢們盡忠地一套又一套，唾沫星直飛向觀衆的臉上。</p>
<p>自行車在人羣中巧妙的穿過去，車行的門前堆滿了舊車和零件。</p>
<p>茶館的門前貼着條子··「水錢一大枚，樓上三小枚。」却眞坐滿了短裝的朋友們，那些登樓遠望的已是抹着一臉驕矜與得意了。</p>
<p>在這裏最闢綽的是皮貨店，夥計們走上三步拉着雇客，那有勁的呌聲使人想到四馬路的野鷄。這些皮貨舗是五家六家地聚在一塊，雖然雇客是那麽少見，還是掙扎着。</p>
<p>由天橋再往南，便是刑塲，好奇的人探問着消息，老行家會摸看下巴笑笑··</p>
<p>「今早兒才斃了一個，不先給訊兒的！」</p>
<p>人像水流一樣，湧向天橋去，這裏是没有什麽高門檻的，多少在水平綫以下的人都記着它，雖然看去這天橋似乎就是地橋，游滿着在生活中嘆息的人們，但在他們看來，這却是地獄中的天橋。</p>
<h3>繭（一）</h3>
<p>— （林房雄原著）靜子譯</p>
<p>一看到了繭子，我就想起了酒井康雄。然而我現在已經是個都會人了，丨丨是一個衹能看見商店裏陳列窗内月與蘆花的裝飾，纔會感到秋已來臨的都會人了，我已經没有機會，再能看見飛鴉打落糙葉樹果子的鄉間小路上，獨輪車一搖一擺載着的生繭籠子了。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>酒井與我，是中學裏的朋友。在同一寄宿舍的同一房間中，我們兩個人並排着小棹子，像雙生兒那樣的相親相愛着。</p>
<p>中學校的後面，是一個長着小松的丘陵。到初夏的時候，這些小松的根旁，散開着許多野花，這白色的野花叢中，條紋模樣的小蛇蜿蜒着。</p>
<p>「凛亮的東西哪！」</p>
<p>有時候，他總是一面追趕着這鱗片反照着初夏的陽光，靜靜隠入於花叢中的小蛇，一面這樣感慨似的説着。</p>
<p>「凛亮的東西哪！」丨丨説這句話，在他也許多少是有意義的。因爲他常是被同級中壤脾氣的同學們，用「髒東西」這一個打碎脆弱小靈魂的綽號稱呼着。他什麽時候都是穿着粉碎的衣服，因此，他講小蛇，怕多少是含有嫉視的意義的罷。他以天生聰明的頭腦，常在同級中考着第一。他可以説是極端的聰明，但也可以説是極端的貧窮，與我這個旣不十分聰明，又不十分貧窮的人，正是一個極好的對照。我是他唯一的知友，也是他唯一的同情者，假若他學費欠繳的時候，我會毫不顧惜的拿出我一部分的零用錢來的。</p>
<p>總之，在丘麓的中學校寄宿舍中，我們兩個人並排着小棹子，像雙生兒似的相親相愛着。</p>
<p>從丘陵的上面，可以看見海。兩個中學生常常爬上這個丘陵，向着那晴空下靑色的顏料碟子，投着那决不會投到的小石，有時候，吹着那不合拍的「愛河」（Ａｍｏｕｒ　Ｒｉｖｃｒ）二部合唱走下這丘陵。</p>
<p>有一天，我們二個人走丘陵上看到一條蛇正在吞吃一只靑蛙。這條蛇好像下顎要脱落似的張開着嘴。靑蛙脚的吸盤露出在蛇嘴外，不住顫動着像是求救似的。我看見酒井的眉毛在跳動了。突然，他的灰白的鞋子，往前拚命踢着蛇身子，轉身又用鞋踏着蛇頭，扁平黄色的蛇唇中，流出了一條紅色血絲，他一邊怒駡着··</p>
<p>「畜生！」</p>
<p>靑蛙終於是被救了。頭上滿帶着了黏滑的蛇的唾液，倒臥在草上不動了。</p>
<p>「畜生！畜生！」</p>
<p>酒井又再這樣怒駡着。丨丨關於蛇，我但記到有這樣一回事。</p>

<p>花市平靜、因美棉徴漲、而印棉回跌、市塲謠風平息、多空兩方、視局勢安定、皆抱觀望態度、以致交易减少、升降亦小、但大户之多額、仍關閉不放、現棉銷路沉悶、惟一部份消息、各路來源、有漸漸增多之望、</p>
<p>鄭標成交額低落　標棉前市開盤、以美印棉市、均呈平疲之狀、而金市亦呈盤旋、平衡税未動、市塲謠言已息、故市况無大變化、塲中交易甚少、各月微跌五分至二埆、午後聞本月份空方交貨、約有四五千擔之譜、市情亦平、結果各月漲跌五分至一角半、查賣出賡豐一千擔、穗隆八百擔、長豐一千擔、益康一千六百擔、益豐八百擔、德記九百擔、生源一千二百擔、買進瑞源二千六百擔、遠大七百擔、仁豐六百擔、大豐一千六百擔、義成一千二百擔、益康九百擔、長和一千擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>美棉不脱盤旋之局</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、十二月期及一月期多頭因交割通知增加、繼續了結、同時股票疲軟、故各月跌去二磅音、賣户不多、後因同業買進、本地空户抵補、重行回昂、目前市况不脱盤旋之局、政府貸欵、回足阻止抛賣、囤棉出售、亦可使買户寒心也、收盤堅定、各月漲一至八磅音、結果現貨不動、期貨漲一至八磅音、英棉現貨漲二點、期貨跌一二點、印棉因經紀商及歐洲出口商買進而堅、計平果爾漲二角半、奥姆辣跌二角半、白羅溪跌一羅比、原電錄左、（十九日電）</p>

<h3>本月上旬棉紗之銷數</h3>
<p>丨比十一月爲减丨</p>
<p>本埠某洋行調查十二月上旬中日紗運往各方銷數、計四千三百六十七包、比十一月下旬之六千一百二十一包、减少一千七百五十四包、華紗運往各方銷數計一萬零入百七十七包、比十一月下旬之一萬四千五百十三包、减少三千六百</p>
<p>三十六包、華紗銷路减少之原因、謂華南一帶買氣萎縮、日紗向海外輸出不振也、茲將華日紗運銷數量及地名摘錄於下（單位包）</p>

<h3>糧食　期粉麥進出兩寂</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平靜</p>
<p>盤旋之象、以洋麥報價芝加哥回跌四角零、坎拿大跌八分至一角二三分、當開價時、本月份市氣、曾見鬆動、聞價破進五角關口、惟遠期各月份、以廠家有動、業外亦少動靜、故市氣平定、以後之本月份、遂亦因此帶穏、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、更趨清寂雙方出入、毫無精彩、本月份因客帮尙有抽動、仍見穏定、遠欺因洋拆步高、一部分多頭、微有了結遂見略軟也、結果本月份較小半分、一二月份小二釐半、三月份不動、四月份好二釐半、五月份未動、</p>
<p>麥市上下開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平寂之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌四角零坎拿大跌八分至一角零、當開價時、本月份交易、依然清淡、惟洋麥報價、人心似稍軟弱、因此交易雖未見暢、價則略小、下午開盤、交易仍潰、價亦疲滯不前、因結賬已近、本月份之貨、頗多預備交割、是以現貨雖未轉鬆、標凖則難起色也、結果本月份較小一分、一二月份小二分、餘無上落、現麥因廠胃不動、又擯住未開、</p>
<p>芝加哥　小麥反映國外需要之不足及新買進</p>
<p>之缺乏、國内供結似頗充足、在本届冬麥收成之預測前、價格恐難有長足之進步、玉蜀黍目下情形爲運銷不暢、現貨地位鬆弛、及人心不佳</p>

<h3>河米藴伏軟象</h3>
<p>（滬南）客都來源祇三十餘號、貨共五千石、各都厚粳俱守老　、惟銷塲平常、後勢深伏軟氣、晚稻雖靑島　包胃繼續動辦近千包、卒因本胃不健、行情帶軟數分近角、杜洋尖平平、陰元則賴貨稀、似稍帶緊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河埠各都來船十七號、河存二百三四十艘、市銷方面‘白粳包胃轉呆、本街銷路平常、早稻薄稻尙化羊杜埠客秈變兀陰兀零胃清淡、近日夫胃滯細、係又受銀根緊迫之故、市形白粳疲小數分、羊杜埠客尖早薄稻平定、變元陰元價跌一二角、</p>
<h3>湖糙紅獨跌角半</h3>
<p>丨期小絞議價未妥丨</p>
<p>昨「洋米」市况　貨主心思仍堅、不肯低價脱帮、新到各貨尙未盡數發樣、奈邇日到頭太多、且銀根奇緊、購户多爲觀望、統市衹本街辦去西貢一千包、内地碎米七百包、期貨由雅利抛出五百噸、回　三百噸、另有恒義等抛售小絞、討價四元八角半、進户嫌大未妥、其他兜售亦多不能妥恊、故價雖未小、市已趨下、「客秈」昨本街内地去胃均淡、初以貨主堅待、價未下落、近晚内地辦成湖南糙紅一千四百包、價八元九埆二分、比前日突落角半、其他各米亦在看小中、</p>
<h3>黄豆繁需上騰不已</h3>
<p>昨市黄豆到接存厚、市態尙穏、原因胃化頗勁、計通州車坊辦去穎州陳豆四車、價開三元六角三至六角一、　家採去歸德豆一千四百包、價爲三元五角三至五角、又去歸德靑豆一千包、價扯三元四角二、又去漢口車豆三千包、價自三元五角至二角、本街錫常辦去漢口乍豆二千七百包、價自三元三角半至六角二、遲豆五百包、價爲三元二角半至二角三、又去沙市豆二百包、價爲三元二角半、行情較前日續漲二三分、</p>
<h3>油市</h3>
<p>產地歉收滬存微薄</p>
<p>新貨柏油積極高漲</p>
<p>柏油自新貨登塲後、市面即趨嚴重、各處存底均告銷罄、浙路產新最早、而年令浙西最欠、核與去年、實祇三成、故不獨無貨行銷滬市、且有向滬行採辦荆油、以抵不足、在滬市每逢產新之</p>
<p>時、浙路新貨、必源源而來、所以滬上行家斯時</p>
<p>本不多備、乃今庚一反往年情形、浙路新油隻件無到、江西帮反在漢口辦貨、則浙贛兩省出新地點、昔有餘而今見絀、各處旣不得新油均　趨漢市採辦陳油、以代銷暢、無如漢市陳油底積亦不豐盈、一經各帮搶辦、出其不意、所存一掃而完後連途貨次第售罄、價格即飛黄騰逹、無木重荆漢規已增至十二兩外、麻城新貨絡繹到有四五百件、均爲各帮借裝、大槪開價恐在十一兩五六錢之間、近日各處因恐借裝貨將來盤面開大、故均去函止借、　待開盤後再辦矣、本埠客貨惟有到過江西油五十件、大約客盤總在十九元以上、其貨且稍有水氣、當此缺貨之時、各行分派尙且有敷、　論選擇、查統市存積不足五百件、若大上海當銷之際、而僅此區區存貨、實屬駭人聽聞、所以現市重荆售價已加至每砠二十元、然仍無現油、須待到可裝也、嘉興本車合到滬市須二十三元光景、較荆油高出三元左右、用者不甚合算、故迄今未有人辦過、</p>
<h3>糖市　本廠綿白續升二角</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>情書拍賣</h3>
<p>— 牛</p>
<p>拿破崙原是一個世界的怪傑，旣是一位專制魔王，又是一個多情種了，所以他在生前，曾幹了不少的風流韻事。據十七日倫敦電。「此間拍賣行，今日拍賣拿破崙之情書，此項情書，係拿翁寄交瑪麗魯憶斯皇后，共三百十八封，」又電「法國政府，頃以一萬五千鎊，購得拿丰崙一世之親筆書翰三百封，其中多有未經刊行者。」又電「去年出賣拿翁致其愛人約瑟夫之情書八封，共値英金四千四百鎊云。」</p>
<p>這樣算來，拿破崙一封情書的價値，自五十金鎊而至五百五十金鎊，其情書代價之鉅，可以想見。所以倫敦拍賣行，前日賣出拿翁情書三百十八封，祇售一萬五千金鎊，眞是十分便宜。大約也是英國市塲不景氣的緣故，所以還是血本大賤賣呢。</p>
<p>談到情書，我國出產的數量最多，正如用機器製造的一般豐富，中等學校以上的學生，任憑敎授們在講台上亂跳亂呌，講得天花亂墜，如小熱昏一般地有味兒，但有種學生，往往蹲在課堂角落裏大寫其情書，毫不聽見，商店裏的夥計們，因爲市面的不景氣，商意經清淡，也在櫃台上偷偷地如龍蛇入筆一樣的寫情書，十分得意。倘若你有權力每天到各郵局去檢查一下，包你毎天有數千封，至少亦得數百封的情書發現。</p>
<p>倘然把這種情書，像拿翁的情書發賣起來，莫説每封情書的代價四百五十金鎊，就是血本大犠牲，廉價出售，每封情書祇售五十金鎊，我想非但我國的國債，可以完全清償，就是我國的建設事業，戰爭時所用的飛機大砲，均可以情書的代價，拿來措辦，已是綽乎有餘，豈不大妙。</p>
<p>我嘗聽見人家説，戀愛救國，我正在疑惑。戀愛怎樣可以救國呢？現在方才知道，戀愛除「目挑心許」之外，情書是一種重要工具。所謂戀愛救國，其實就是情書救國呢。我勸幾位多情種子，趕快去寫情書來救國。</p>
<h3>無話可答</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>（經騐之談）</p>
<p>前天我因事趁火車返松，早去暮回，打了　一張來回票，省却一角五分大洋，亦不無小補也，歸途車中，殊爲無聊，適遇知友某君，隨意暢談，從世界大事，談到我松中學畢業生做强盜。（因爲是日松江西門大街日豐銀樓，被刧，匪徒名趙志毅，係徐匯公學中學畢業生云）。無非大家深深地倒抽了一口長氣，實在無話可説。</p>
<p>未幾車抵莘莊，照例茶房先生要收茶錢了。凡泡茶的朋友們，大家須得「伸腰」「破鈔」。隔坐有位乘客，問茶房，茶錢若干？答曰，兩角，此人面部卽發現驚異的樣子，説如此一杯清茶，要兩角錢麽？你道茶房先生怎樣回答？先生，你看幾位做人家的先生，本來不肯泡茶的，泡得茶的先生們，必定是吃慣用慣，這些决不肯計較的。那人無話可答，就摸去兩角小洋，給了茶房。</p>
<p>友人就説道，出門總要裝些大肚皮，小的地方，决不可算。此人一算了小，連我們都被他「皮裏陽秋」到，這個茶房，眞是可惡，但是像這個茶房的，原是很多，倘没有看見過世面的人，出門必定要「碰碰頂子」，「觸了一鼻子灰」的，所以出門，一定有些經騐，要曉得「門檻」，孔老夫子説「入境而問禁，入國而問　」，就是這個道理，前日我聽見幾件事體，都是面紅耳赤，無話可答的，我講給你聽吧··（以下都是友人所講的事實）</p>
<p>我友某君，前日由滬返松，乘二等車，中途，腹中覺得有些飢餓，便喊了</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>一客茄哩鷄飯，食畢，問價値幾何，答曰，三角大洋，某君説，我吃慣都是二角半的，從没有出過三角。「僕歐」笑而答曰，先生坐慣三等車的，這裏是二等車，所以必須三角，某君無話可答。</p>
<p>友人又説，上月我同二三個朋友，到某家酒館裏去吃飯，隨便呌了幾樣菜，内中有只「榨八」。後來算賬，見「榨八」開價八角，我訝其太貴。説「榨八」一些些東西，你要賣我們八角大洋麽？堂倌便笑説道，先生什麽呌做「榨八」，你知道麽？我便目定口呆，那裏還得出他的娘家，堂倌看我答不出，便道，怎樣呌做榨八？榨八便是拿一只完全的童鷄，去頭，去脚，去肩膀，切成八塊，方放到鍋子裏去榨，這呌做「榨八塊」，一只鷄賣你八角大洋，怎樣説貴呢？我亦無話可答。</p>
<p>還有一事，今年夏天，我和三位朋友來滬購物，吃了夜飯，在旅館中，無聊得很，某君提議，我們不如呌了一輛汽車去兜兜風，枯坐在此，實屬無聊，横竪三個袁頭一點鐘，可以換換新鮮空氣，看看洋塲風景綫，我首先贊同，其餘兩友，也多説好，於是便在附近一家汽車公司，呌了一輛篷車，説明兜風一小時，其時某君看自己的錶，是九點三刻，於是由大馬路而黄浦灘，而靜安寺等處，兜了一陣之後，汽車夫説時間到了。車也停了。某君摸出錶來一看，尙没到十點半鐘，便對汽車夫道，方纔九點三刻開車，現在還没有到十點半鐘，怎樣説時間已到了？汽車夫把手上帶的手錶一看，鼻子裏哼了一聲，説道，阿拉的手錶，一百二十兩銀子買的，你們幾塊錢一只錶，那裏會準呢？某君也無話可答。</p>
<h3>冬日墮筆</h3>
<p>— 士型</p>
<p>爐邊</p>
<p>望見了對面人家從晶瑩的玻璃窗中伸出來的烟囱，遲緩地冒着温暖的烟時，妻凄然地説··</p>
<p>「我們幾時才能裝火爐呢！」</p>
<p>「早咧。」</p>
<p>「可是晚上不是屋瓦上已經舖了很厚的霜麽？」</p>
<p>「可是我們不是應該像忍受貧困那樣去忍寒冷，在寒冷裏邊使自己堅强起來麽？」</p>
<p>「我知道你是存心想凍死我。」</p>
<p>對於這樣歇斯底里的，不體諒的話，不由生起氣來··「那麽爲什麽要嫁我這樣的貧土呢？」那樣地嘲諷了她，爲着避免跟她吵閙，便走了出來，走到街上却後悔起來了。是十一月，是初冬的天天氣了，我可以忍受寒冷，可是有什麽理由强迫穿着一件薄棉袍，爲綿延的疾病所苦惱着的妻和我一同地忍受寒冷呢？</p>
<p>在電影院裏的人們好像忘記了冬天</p>
<p>第二天，便當了我僅有的飾物，那隻訂婚戒，租了隻火爐，傍晚的時候在屋子裏生起火來。</p>
<p>望着在屋陬熊熊地燃燒着的煤塊上面冒出來的親切的火光，滿懹歡喜地抬起頭來··「坐到火爐旁邊來吧，」向妻那麽説着時，却看見一張靜靜地流着淚的，憔悴的臉。</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢，還那麽地哭洒着丨不是已經有了火爐，而且你也已經被憂傷呑蝕得够了麽？」</p>
<p>妻注視了我半天，忽然憐憫地説道··「火爐對於我們眞是太奢侈了！」</p>
<p>虚榮心很大的妻會把火爐當作奢侈品眞是不可理解的事，而且要求裝火爐的不就是她麽？我正在驚奇的時候，她撫摸着我的臉道··「看看你自己吧，這一年的貧困已經使你變成三十歲的中年人了呵。」</p>
<p>擺脱了她的手，在爐子旁邊默默地坐了下來，我的心臟像蒙了陣灰塵似的，越來越陰沉了，而在窗外散佈着的正是初冬的，寒冷而幽黯的黄昏。</p>
<h3>人生</h3>
<p>— 甲辰</p>
<p>我不相信人生有什麽可以値得歌詠或留戀的地方。除了在童年的時候對於一切都無知無覺，過着原始時代亞當夏娃似的的日子。一旦走出童年的樂園，而給人們呌做成人了的時候，同時亦就永遠脱離伊甸園的美境，更永遠脱離幸福的享受。一方面就踏入生的苦途了，從此躑躅在生的苦途上磨難。受着一切的災禍和摧折，頂着生的重擔，生活的石臼，長年長日讓那重擔，讓那石臼壓着，而每個人就那麽壓在石臼底下，呼聲喘氣的彳亍着，以至於彳亍的能力全消失，於是不是在走動，而是在匍匐着了，再於是便漸漸地彎了脖子，拘了腰，日子一久，説不定從壯個子，成了柴把似的一堆皮包骨頭的軀殼，而從完全像一個人弄得完全不像一個人，到了此時亦便快完了蛋了。</p>
<p>可是無論誰都要頑固地活着，就是到了赤裸裸只留着一條光身子，仍然對自己不値錢的生命加以無限的珍重，活下去，也許尙有一點希望吧，有了這末的一個念頭，於是卽使每天老癟着肚子過不了日子也還依戀着生。不願意回去。寗可聽憑那壓在腦袋上邊的生的石臼壓得動彈不得，依然不肯放手，拼命頂起石臼掙扎，跌下去，再爬上來，爬上來，又跌了下去，這樣地終於到了最後一口氣力都没有時，方甘心。人們到底那樣，充滿了生之慾是爲了什麽呢，實在是使人猜不透的，時常瞧到有一種殘廢者，所作爲討生的工具的手足都不完整了，然而他們尙翻轉着自己殘缺的身體在路上呌號着，向着來往的路人乞個銅子，難道這種人的生還有什麽興緻和希望麽，我就不明白他們亦爲了什麽而仍要如此固執地活着，我設想他們死了一定比生着愉快得多，可是他們徧徧要活，而且和常人一樣的要求着，這就太呌人不解了。</p>
<p>如若説，造物之神旣然賦給你一份生命，你自然要活的，但是活着將如何呢，是不是每天吃三頓飯，睡睡覺的這末活法。是不是一個人從呱呱墮地，而長成，而討妻，而生孩子，而老，而死的這末活法。假使這樣就算活，就算是人生，那所謂人生根本便有點滑稽的。不過，凡是呌做人，大多數是如此活法的。而像這樣的活法，不活不算一回事，活了亦不算一回事。就活了一輩子亦等於不活一樣。</p>
<p>但毎個人之所以都要執抝地活，大約是爲了每個人對於自己的生都噙住一半希望，有一種美麗的憧憬長在心頭，呌他們賣氣力，也因此有了濃厚的興味。於是不妨給生的石臼壓得面黄肌瘦，一點没有怨言，也不灰心。然而被認爲做生的憧憬丨或理想，實在上是並不存在，縱存在，簡直像天上的雲朶那麽渺茫。充其量不外自己騙自己，聊以解嘲而已，而因爲如此，許多人皆情愿頂着石臼，滿想塗金的日子會降臨在後頭。儘管想。把平凡的生活變成不平凡。彷彿人生眞會如自己所想那末堂皇不得了。結果呢，所謂憧憬自是一塲幻夢，夢是永不會結果子的，或者還化成一堆灰，别的不曾得到。只得不了一些失望和空虚，平凡的人生那裏會變成不平凡，終局依然是過了一輩子莫明其妙的人生。同樣是胡里胡塗的。</p>
<p>然而爲了那一個不容易成事實的所謂人生的憧憬，人都各各扮起彼此不同的各樣臉嘴來了，小丑的，獰猙的，烏花的複雜得有如舞臺上的花臉孔一樣。同時就都用着心計來，誰覷準誰，趁着一個不留神便一下子踢倒了你，自己踏到上面來，這樣互相窺伺着，那個有什麽空罅，那個便打過來。而往往爲了自己欲佔點便宜，則無妨將良心放在一旁，讓别人吃虧，同時卽是自己得意，然而踏在别人身上的，終也要被人踏上來。而最後自己頭上生的石臼亦會把你自己壓得伸不過氣的。</p>
<p>人生到底就是這麽一回事？</p>
<h3>灰色間</h3>
<p>— 櫻之</p>
<p>一個孩子的流浪。</p>
<p>他不知道出世後失去了父親抑或在出世前的一天，一年已死去了父親；他没有看清一下母親的臉龐是怎麽和藹得可親，當他剛開眼的時候，却又正母親閉眼的時候丨這麽遺留下的一個孤另的孩子是開始流浪了。</p>
<p>他半幸運得着一個才新死去第一個兒子的母親的憐憫，簡接他做了這個母親的兒子，由於這個母親的奶汁，供給了他的體質温飽。</p>
<p>母親用以自己的親兒子愛護他，十分體貼地關懹着代替的孩子的身子健康。</p>
<p>慢慢孩子從過程長大了丨能够不喫奶，能够講話，進而能够一個子從一個村頭到另一個村頭再回來，不須用問路不摸錯了！</p>
<p>晚間，他能够隨便感想起自己是一個没有雙親的孤另孩子，但是他也會因感激這個母親的培植，熱切，而私泣起來！</p>
<p>他孝順這個母親正比例和這個母親體貼這個孩子一樣，天倫的愛護，關切！</p>
<p>有一個晚上，母親病了，病得很利害。臉孔變着香烟外包的臘紙一樣潦白丨</p>
<p>他拔脚去請方郎中回來，第二次他又看到第二個母親的眼睛又緊閉上了，他嚎哭了起來！</p>
<p>爺叔搶進了家，把一切物件全扣住保管了。</p>
<p>失去了哺乳的母親，也失去了家，</p>
<p>以後，他又開始第二次的流浪了。</p>
<p>他挾了只大蔴袋在對門石階上過了一個夜。</p>
<p>拉住了頭蓋不住脚，第二天起身，死去了二隻脚！</p>
<p>脚冰麻得堅不起身子，噗哧跌衝往前一交！</p>
<p>哇！一個發極的聲響從他身子底下抽呌起來，一個同樣年齡的女孩子，臉孔靑得發紫，被壓得透不過氣！</p>
<p>他脱下自己的棉襖給她穿了，挽住她頭頸倒睡在自己胸懹裏，自己裹上了大麻袋在肩胛上。</p>
<p>手心替這個孩子的胸口摩着，漸漸在她嘴裏吐出一絲氣來。</p>
<p>他得着了一個知己！</p>
<p>她給後母的姘夫趕出來的没有父親母親的孤另孩子。</p>
<p>他們同道了度着這樣流浪的生涯！</p>
<p>有一個傍晚上，天黑暗得已看不清東西了，他們没有找覓着一頓大餅子的早飯。</p>
<p>肚子咕嚕得實在按不住嘞，没奈何又把褲帶拉凑緊些。肉切緊得一陣發痛！</p>
<p>前面挑過來包飯作的飯筒，顧不得什麽倒了來在報紙裏挑飯的對他們白了一陣眼，丨小癟三！</p>
<p>她埋怨不該做這種勾當的，爲什麽須遭人駡小癟三哪！</p>
<p>但是肚子委實餓得癟嘞。</p>
<p>他讓她先吃，但是她不肯吃。</p>
<p>他哭得走了，</p>
<p>回轉來，他看見她也正哭得利害，心子更給酸得利害呐！</p>
<p>第二天由他陪着她回後母家裏去。他拚命在石板上磕了幾個響頭，懇請收留這個可憐的孩子吧！</p>
<p>後母在左右鄰居的尖鋭的目光下，拉進了她到灶間裏。</p>
<p>她看見他離開大門的一刹，眼珠进不住的流了出來。</p>
<p>他又一個兒流浪着了！</p>
<p>有一次重新經過這個大門時，那個女孩子死呐！</p>
<p>他猜不出她是怎樣死的？</p>
<p>上帝保佑這個孩了永遠平安罷。</p>
<p>他眼眶裏没有了眼淚！</p>

<h3>熱情花</h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>（植物大辭典··</p>
<p>「西番蓮，一名熱情花（Ｐａｓｓｉｏｎ　Ｆｌｏｗｅｒ），花瓣作十字形，象徴聖基督十字架上之熱情，故名。」</p>
<p>丨丨十字架上的熱情啊！）</p>
<p>我走了。</p>
<p>走的前一夜，她給我送來一束小小的西番蓮，銀白色的。</p>
<p>丨丨爲了生活，也値得什麽感傷的嗎？整個的天地在生活面前都不得不低頭的。這年代，還有不爲生活上十字架的靑年漢子嗎？</p>
<p>沈思着，感傷着。又聽着她　克羅咪的聲音··</p>
<p>丨丨西番蓮底花朶是象徴着十字架上的苦難的熱情的；把它送給你，它便象徴着生活之苦難的光榮了，不好的嗎</p>
<p>丨丨好的，謝謝你。生活也許有着它底苦難的熱情，而這熱情是光榮的。你便那麽地記憶着我吧。</p>
<p>丨丨熱情是光榮的，我便那麽記着你。</p>
<p>丨丨謝謝你。</p>
<p>這麽着，我便走了。</p>
<p>走，是爲了生活，也是爲了自己底年靑；暴風雨中的孩子是總喜歡把自己底年靑當作武器的，對家庭，對社會，對一切的不合理。</p>
<p>整個的幼年時代是在古墓一般的舊社會中蝕去了的，那兒有腐爛了的古屍，怕人的骸骨，與積壓成了化石的堅硬的泥土··當一個日子，一縷枯萎的靈魂從地層中蘇醒過來的時候，它便感到難以忍受的窒息了，紐動着··終於找到了一個機會，離去了腐屍股的古城，離去了没落下去的家，也不帶一點感傷的調子，便秋天的葉子那麽地，向着廣大的世界飄去了，一里，又一里。</p>
<p>一里，又一里，便那麽漫漫地流浪着，笑着，掙扭着；早晨爬上尖刀般的山峯，晚上又潛進爆炸似的駭濤丨丨丨可是據説，這便是又代表了生活的慘劇呢。</p>
<p>丨丨眞的便是生活的慘劇嗎？疑慮了。</p>
<p>回答我的是她··「是的。」</p>
<p>我震驚了··她，是一年前就認識的；可是難道也曾在地區中培養過來的花朶嗎？</p>
<p>可是··奇跡哪，一點兒都没有錯，她也是自己在每一個今天去打發每一個明天的呢。這樣，便做了星火般一閃的生活路上的朋友了。</p>
<p>是朋友了；可是，我發現了她比我多了一點東西，據説，是對生活的十字架上的熱情。</p>
<p>該死的，流浪的人也允許有熱情的嗎？</p>
<p>可是，最該死的，便是··從她那兒却學到了感傷啦！</p>
<p>每天在黑的太陽面前駡着··駡她，駡自己。</p>
<p>把一個日子打發到夜裏，心便像絞着一般的丨丨都怕呢，瞧着日子像黄昏的烏鴉的影子似的一個個地飛去了，失去了靑春，也許會失去武器，失去生活的力的呢。</p>
<p>謝謝天，我不允許再在這兒生活下去了。心頭祇記着她底一句話··「把自己投向生活去，流浪的孩子啊，你是必需有着聖基督在十字架上的，那種熱情的。」</p>
<p>便一聲不響地，走了。</p>
<p>帶在身旁的是那束呌做熱情花的西番蓮。</p>
<p>船在埠頭停下的時候，黄昏了。怱怱的拿着東西走上岸，看束在籃子裏的西番蓮，枯萎了。</p>
<p>沈默地，摘下了二片白色的十字形的花瓣。把它平坦地夾在書頁間，便握着枯萎的花束，對着小河一揚··</p>
<p>丨丨熱情與十字架，去你的吧；在生活面前，就是你們也不得不讓步的。</p>
<p>走上岸，已經是黄昏了。</p>

<p>人間竟有惡姻緣。説到離婚心要酸。他們是意見各存難共住。省得那時時交滴向枕邊喧。有幾個情天别訂鴛鴦牒。有幾個重築香巢聚鳳鸞。有幾個棄舊憐新甘薄倖。有幾個重婚難把髮妻瞞。因此上大家只好來談判。先把那勞燕分飛細説穿。情惻惻。恨漫漫。竟好比七省鋼刀在心上攢。約到律師同納費。好花枝從此不轉圓。有的是臨行握手仍親吻。有的是子女牽衣竟淚不乾。有的是氣憤憤掉頭甘永别。有的是假惺惺尙欲砍媚嬋娟。且看他各尋鴛侶求同夢。恐怕是前後依然出一般。陌路　郎休更戀。琵琶重抱恨懸懸。就此把露水夫妻一筆圈。</p>

<h3>Report of the British Industrial Mission</h3>
<p>Thirty-Six Pages Long, Published Yesterday</p>
<p>Regardless, Expresses Goodwill Towards Japan</p>
<p>Starting with Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>(London) The report of the British Industrial Association's Manchuria Survey Mission, which is biased towards Japan, has been published. The document is 36 pages long and advocates that Britain and Japan should conclude an economic treaty and abandon the global commercial war. The report states that the government of the so-called "Manchukuo" is prepared to make proposals inviting the British business community to participate in the development of "Manchukuo," and that contracts for the export of British steel products to Manchuria and Japan in the coming year have been concluded. The report also states that the "Manchukuo" authorities have given the chairman of the mission, Sir Barnby, a written guarantee that the principle of British cooperation in the development of "Manchukuo" has been effectively accepted. Although the report repeatedly states that the survey mission has no political nature, its tone is very friendly towards Japan, with only slight criticisms of certain aspects of Japanese policy and administration. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) The mission sent by the British Industrial Federation to Japan and Manchuria for inspection has returned to the country for many days, and its report has just been published today. The document declares that the mission is purely non-official and non-political in nature, and that reports that members of the mission have made statements of a political nature are completely unfounded. Now that the mission has entered into new contracts, the British Industrial Federation is better able to introduce those who are interested to major business and political circles in Japan. The document also advises relevant business firms to send responsible representatives to conduct on-the-ground investigations of various issues as soon as possible. During this trip to Japan, it was felt that the Japanese people have a genuine spirit of friendship towards Britain. This spirit of friendship has been further consolidated by the mission's trip to Japan and the establishment of permanent links between the British and Japanese business communities in London and Tokyo. After the tour, the mission firmly decided that there were real opportunities for British industry to expand with regard to the current rapid development and has offered the cooperation of British industry to the "Manchukuo" authorities. Subsequently, a written guarantee was received accepting the principle of this cooperation, and concrete proposals to support this cooperation will soon be submitted to the mission, so that British industry can greatly participate in the development projects currently being planned. However, prices and payment methods will be negotiated mutually in preparation for participation. An agreement has been reached regarding the supply of steel products to Japan and delivery in Japan and Manchuria in 1935, and the details have been notified to the British Iron and Steel Federation. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The full text of the report of the British Industrial Alliance's Far East Survey Mission, totaling 36 pages and more than 12,000 words, is divided into two categories: the main text and appendices. It was published on the 20th under the name of Sir Barnby. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The survey mission investigated the actual situation in Japan and "Manchukuo." As a result of negotiations, various proposals were prepared for the development of Manchuria by British industrial operations. An agreement has now been concluded for the supply of British iron and steel products to Japan and Manchuria next year. In addition, "Manchukuo" has promised to hand over to Chairman Ba the documents on the development of Manchuria by British assistance. Therefore, the survey mission has obtained guarantees regarding commercial requests, and thus Britain has indeed obtained a large sales market in "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>(1) Japan and "Manchukuo" both use the Japanese yen as their base currency, so there is a possibility of forming a currency alliance. (1) In the next few years, "Manchukuo" lacks the possibility of long-term lending. Therefore, the payment for important projects in Manchuria must be based on a deferred payment structure.</p>
<p>(1) As a result of consultations on economic cooperation between the British Industrial Alliance and the Japanese Economic Alliance, it was decided to establish committees in London and Tokyo, and the following items of cooperation policy were determined: (A) Market segmentation based on meaningful and directional export controls; (B) Regional market segmentation; (C) Mutual activities related to the development of undeveloped markets; (D) Rationalization of production such as negotiation of export prices, forms, and quality; (E) Joint operation of manufacturing plants (1) Commercial antagonism between Britain and Japan is now acute. However, it seems that Japanese products will become high-end products in the future, and exports will also increase, such as fiber industry, cement, rubber, etc., and wool industrial products and machinery will also enter the market, which will inevitably lead to fierce competition. However, it is not believed that Japanese products can completely dominate the world market.</p>
<p>(1) The inspection team hopes that Japan will ensure the interests of British merchants. Also, Britain is in a position where it has to take difficult measures in order to maintain the sales channels of British products. However, if Britain and Japan continue to compete in a commercially destructive manner, the results are difficult to predict. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that Britain and Japan will adjust their industries. In addition, British industry is in an unsatisfactory state, and the excellent claims of Japanese industry are the result of industrial rationalization. (Dentsu Telegram, 20th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Military Council has issued instructions to its affiliated agencies, stating that it has received instructions from Chairman Chiang that various official matters have been shelved and not approved in recent times, and that some have even been delayed for more than half a year. With such negligence, how can the country stand? Why wait for defeat and destruction?

<h3>Yuan Liang Arrives in Nanjing to Visit Wang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yuan Liang, Mayor of Peiping, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 20th with Jin Juru, a member of the council. He visited President Wang in the afternoon and reported everything in person. He is scheduled to return to Peiping the same day. Jin said that the Committee for the Consolidation of Cultural Relics of the Old Capital has been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be presided over by the Peiping Political Committee and will be established soon. Today, after arriving in Nanjing, Yuan visited President Wang again, requesting instructions on how to allocate two-thirds of the central government's subsidy for consolidation funds. After the decision, he will return north immediately. The demarcation issue has not progressed because the Hebei Province still insists that the urban area should not be expanded. As for the report that the Tongjilong Company intends to invest in Peiping, it may be a commercial investment of a tourist group nature prepared for the realization of Peiping as a tourist area, which is not related to the consolidation plan. During this trip to Shanghai, there was no contact with finance. All tax revenue agencies were instructed to remit all taxes to the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications, If there are no branches of the three banks in the local area, the tax revenue should be accumulated to 100 yuan and remitted by mail at any time. It must not be remitted through other banks or money shops. Otherwise, if there is a danger, they shall be fully responsible for compensating and paying the taxes, and shall be punished.

<h3>Ma Yinchu Vigorously Refutes Rumors of Currency Inflation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu said that the rumors of a currency inflation policy have been vigorously refuted and clarified by the authorities. Those who know the facts should believe that the government will never take such a great risk. Generally speaking, there are two types of currency inflation policies: one is that the bottom is shallow, and one has to issue banknotes indiscriminately to facilitate circulation; the other is to resist the outflow of cash and use this policy to consolidate the foundation of cash. Now, the domestic cash reserve is not so much. The banknotes of the banks also have a reserve of 60% according to law. There is no need to be so self-evident. As for the circulation of cash, we should find another way and find good strategies to achieve results. Therefore, in my observation, the government has its own countermeasures for this problem, and it will never consider the currency policy. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>

<h3>Qin Decun Talks About the Opening of the Chahar Pasture</h3>

The Provincial Government has also set up a drug rehabilitation center and announced to merchants that the Chahar Provincial Government has organized a Rural Construction Committee. The Provincial Chairman and committee members are all ex officio members, and other experts have been hired to participate in the new village construction, animal husbandry and hygiene, etc. It has been decided to start with Kabusi Temple and then extend it to other places. Chahar is peaceful, and Song plans to come to Peiping around the New Year. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>

<h3>Pu Tang Secretly Sells Treasures of the Qing Dynasty in Peiping</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Pu Tang and Shi Xia came to Peiping secretly a few days ago to sell a dust-avoiding pearl from the Qing Dynasty collection to Walker Toll, an American antique dealer in Shanghai. Pu Tang took away property from the Prince Regent's mansion when he left Peiping in the 19th year and pawned this dust-avoiding pearl at a foreign bank in Dongjiaomin Lane, mortgaging 20,000 yuan for travel expenses. Now he has negotiated with the American merchant in Shanghai to sell this pearl for 95,000 yuan. Pu Tang came to Peiping specifically to redeem this pearl from a certain bank and resell it to the foreign merchant. Now the transaction between the two parties has been completed, and Pu Tang has returned to Shanghai with the money. It is said that this dust-avoiding pearl was the most beloved object of Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty. Cixi loved pearls, and there were two most precious famous pearls in the palace, one was an amber ball and the other was a dust-avoiding pearl, both as big as chicken eggs, crystal clear and rare in the world. This dust-avoiding pearl can avoid wind and dust. Cixi wore it every time there was a strong wind during her lifetime. After Cixi's death, this pearl was worn by Puyi's wife, Rong. When Feng entered the palace in the 13th year, Puyi and his wife fled, and Rong secretly carried out the two pearls and deposited them with her father Zai Yi in the Prince Regent's mansion, where Pu Tang stole them. Now this national treasure belongs to foreigners. The amber ball was taken to Tianjin by Zai Yi for safekeeping and has been sent to Changchun by Puyi this summer. Because Puyi is often sick, it is said that wearing this amber ball can remove evil spirits. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>The Hebei Provincial Government Orders Ji County to Strictly Arrest the Poor People's Society</h3>
<p>(Peiping) In the area bordering Ji County and Baodi, Houjiaying, a Poor People's Society has gathered, with a population of two or three thousand and more than 1,000 guns, gathering crowds to collect taxes. After the county governments secretly reported to the provincial government, the provincial government ordered the county governments of Ji County and Baodi to pay attention to strictly arresting the leaders and eliminating the remnants. The Ji-Mi District Commissioner's Office also ordered the Ji County Government to send a team to thoroughly clear and disband them. After receiving the telegram order, Ji County Chief Wang Xinggong has sent a team to appease them. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The First Regiment of the Hebei Security Corps sent a large team to Ji County City on the 19th to assist the militia in defense.

<h3>Freedom of the Seas and American Neutrality by Yan</h3>
<p>The high seas are not subject to the jurisdiction of any nation. This is a fundamental principle of international law. Therefore, a country's ships on the high seas in peacetime can be considered its own active territory and should not be interfered with by others. However, in times of international war, the right of belligerent navies to search neutral ships is still generally recognized by all countries. If contraband destined for the enemy country is discovered as a result of the search, it can naturally be confiscated. Whether enemy goods not of a contraband nature can be treated in the same way is a major question. According to the 1856 Declaration of Paris, all belligerent goods transported by neutral ships and all neutral goods transported by belligerent ships, except for contraband, are not subject to confiscation by the enemy. The provisions are very clear. Unfortunately, during the European War, first the German submarine policy, followed by the retaliatory actions of Britain and France, deprived neutral countries of their freedom of navigation. The spirit of the Declaration of Paris was completely lost. Whether the principles in the Declaration of Paris will be respected by belligerents in future wars is difficult to predict. Moreover, there is no legal standard for the nature of so-called contraband. Since the viewpoints of belligerent and neutral countries differ, disputes are inevitable.</p>
<p>The United States has always upheld the principle of freedom of the seas, believing that belligerents should give the greatest respect to the freedom of navigation and commerce of neutral countries. President Wilson made a "Fourteen Points" declaration in January 1918, which stated that there should be absolute freedom of navigation on the seas... except when the seas are blockaded in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants. Wilson, recognizing that the United States' participation in the previous war stemmed from the need to uphold the principle of freedom of the seas, wanted to respect this principle through international cooperation to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.</p>
<p>However, given the intensity of modern warfare and the magnitude of its sacrifices, any country, once drawn into the vortex, is only concerned with defeating the enemy and does not care about international faith. Even if there are agreements to respect freedom of the seas in peacetime, it is not impossible for them to break their promises in wartime to implement their operational objectives. If a neutral country only argues verbally, it will not help in the slightest. It must either willingly concede or use force to defend its neutral rights. Willing concessions are one thing; however, using force as a tool to defend neutrality inevitably leads to abandoning the status of neutrality and entering the war. During the last European War, the United States almost broke with Britain before declaring war on Germany, precisely because the British undermined its freedom of the seas and neutral status in every way. The reason it later joined forces with the British to fight against Germany was that the British damaged American property, while the Germans damaged American lives. When weighing property against life, life is of course more important. From this perspective, since the Americans cannot be sure that future belligerents will respect their freedom of the seas and do not want to maintain their neutral status by force, there is no other way but to revise their traditional policies.</p>
<p>In recent days, talk of the United States revising its neutrality principles has been rife. Upon observing the inside story, we know that this is no accident. The significance of this matter is that, first, it indicates that the brewing of a second world war is becoming increasingly mature. The United States is making this gesture to make clear its desire not to be drawn into the war. Second, it is a message to Japan that, in future international wars, the United States, while unwilling to engage in military conflict with Japan lightly, will also not allow its policy of maintaining freedom of the seas to restrict the actions of those fighting against Japan. Third, it is to foster goodwill with the British, so they will know that, in any future situation, conflict between Britain and the United States is unlikely. Since British territories are spread all over the world, once it enters the war, it will inevitably affect the entire globe. If the British refuse to abandon their right to search neutral ships and blockade enemy ports, and the Americans insist on their policy of freedom of the seas, conflict between the two countries will be difficult to avoid. Conversely, if the Americans are willing to automatically concede, it will greatly facilitate British operations. Since Britain and the United States have this tacit understanding, even the strong Japanese will not dare to act rashly.</p>
<h3>Britain, America, and Japan Wasted Words</h3>
<p>Naval Negotiations Adjourned</p>
<p>Three Countries Issue Joint Declaration</p>
<p>Reconvening in the Near Future Uncertain</p>
<p>Britain and Japan Continue Technical Consultations</p>
<p>(London) The preliminary naval conference of the three countries, which began here at the end of June, was officially announced to be adjourned this afternoon. Delegations from the UK, US and Japan held a plenary session in the House of Commons. British Prime Minister MacDonald chaired the meeting and stated that the UK would take appropriate measures to reconvene naval talks when the time was ripe. The American representative Davis and Japanese representative Matsudaira then delivered replies. (19th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Issuing a Communiqué</h3>
<p>(London) All representatives of the British, American, and Japanese delegations participating in the preliminary London naval talks gathered at the office of Prime Minister MacDonald in the House of Commons this afternoon for the final plenary session. It was announced that the preliminary naval talks would be postponed indefinitely. After the meeting, the following communiqué regarding the postponement of the naval talks was issued to the press:</p>
<p>"This afternoon, the British, American, and Japanese delegations discussed various matters related to the postponement of the preliminary naval talks in the House of Commons. The meeting was chaired by British Prime Minister MacDonald. Attendees included, from the American side, Chief Delegate Davis, Chief of Naval Operations Stanley, Counselor of the Embassy in the UK Atherton, Naval Expert Captain Dumann Schumann, Major Duncan, Field, and Lieber, among others; from the Japanese side, Chief Delegate Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira, Chief Expert Major General Yamamoto, and Experts Kato, Iwashita, Mizota, among others; and from the British side, Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, Admiral Sir Chatfield, and Vice Admiral Liddell-Crichton, among others. As a result of the discussions, it was unanimously agreed that these talks, which began in June of this year and have continued to this day, October 23, were beneficial. These talks were originally intended to prepare for the future naval conference stipulated by the 1930 London Naval Treaty. After various suggestions were made, the scope of the talks expanded, and candid and friendly discussions were held on all aspects of naval issues. The purpose of the preliminary talks was not to reach an urgent conclusion, but only to prepare for the future naval conference to establish an agreement. France and Italy are also signatories to the current naval treaty, so they participated in the discussions when the preliminary talks were held in the summer of this year. The progress of the talks has been continuously notified to those two countries. Although the three governments attending these talks support continued limitation of naval armaments and reduction of naval forces to the extent agreed upon by all relevant countries, the principles and methods required to achieve this goal remain to be determined. The current talks have reached a considerable stage. The representatives of the three countries believe that it is appropriate to announce a postponement at this time so that the representatives of each country can take the opportunity to consult with their respective governments in person and make a more thorough analysis and consideration of the situation created by the results of the talks. Therefore, the representatives of the three countries unanimously agreed that the naval talks should be postponed for the time being. At the same time, the governments of the countries related to the London talks should maintain close contact with each other and, even more so, with the other contracting parties to the London and Washington treaties. The postponement of the talks will also provide the British government with an opportunity to consult with the governments of the British dominions. Furthermore, in terms of the preparatory work completed by past talks, it is hoped that the situation will develop in such a way that the next round of talks can be held quickly when the appropriate time is reached. As the initiator of this preliminary round of talks, Britain should take appropriate steps for the next round of talks." (19th Havas)</p>
<h3>Simon's Broadcast Address</h3>
<p>Japan is Free to Abolish the Naval Treaty</p>
<p>Believes a New Naval Agreement is Not Hopeless</p>
<p>Maintaining Security is Especially Important for Britain</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon gave a radio broadcast speech this evening, commenting on the manner in which the naval negotiations were postponed. He declared that the naval negotiations may be reopened in two or three months. In his speech, Simon said, "Japan will, no later than this month, namely December, notify the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty. Regarding this matter, the Japanese government no longer attempts to conceal it. This is indeed something we deeply regret. However, it must be understood that Japan has the complete freedom to notify the abrogation of the treaty, and no one has the right to oppose it. Furthermore, it is inappropriate to be overly pessimistic about this action by Japan. It should be known that after the Washington Naval Treaty is notified for abrogation, it still has a valid period of two years. (Note: The Washington Naval Treaty is scheduled to expire at the end of 1936.) During this period, various countries can establish a new naval agreement. If this does not happen, if countries fail to conclude a treaty in the future to limit the total tonnage of naval forces and the maximum tonnage of warships of each class, the whole world will encounter a terrible disaster. The efforts of the past regarding disarmament have been remarkably effective, like the Washington and London naval treaties. These two naval treaties have saved the countries involved hundreds of millions of dollars, provided each country with a sense of security, and fostered mutual cooperation to safeguard peace. We are determined to do everything possible to preserve this system in the future, precisely for this reason. The British Empire has responsibilities to its vast dominions and colonies that it cannot abandon. Therefore, we will not compromise on anything necessary for our country's security. At the same time, we must also put ourselves in the position of other countries, give consideration to them, and cooperate with them in an effort to establish a plan that is agreed upon by all countries. This plan must ensure that all countries receive fair treatment and must include the principles I put forward in the House of Commons the other day. What were these principles? That 'equality of security is the right of all nations.' "Simon continued, stating that Japan had put forward several proposals, the gist of which was to establish a new basic system to replace the current naval treaty. This basic system would allow countries to build warships to achieve what is called "the common maximum limit." Therefore, we believe that Japan's implementation of naval construction to reach the common maximum limit is the inevitable result of this proposal by Japan. Japan originally wanted to take this step and considered it timely, so it demanded the right to determine the naval forces that reach the common maximum limit. However, in our view, there are other ways to achieve equality of security. We believe that since the territory of our United Kingdom spans Asia and Europe, and the British territories spread all over the world are not included in this calculation, it is essential for Britain to have a larger navy in order to maintain equality of security. To illustrate, other countries' navies may be able to concentrate in the Pacific, but the British navy is not allowed to concentrate entirely in the Pacific. As for establishing a new agreement base, although the period is still far away and requires a long period of effort, I can tell you that, while I do not ask any country to abandon the principles they deem most important, we are already bound to find a way to establish a basis that is acceptable to all parties, so that the world does not encounter the scourge of unlimited arms competition after the current treaty expires. The British government was the initiator of this preliminary naval talks. When the time is right, the UK should take appropriate steps. In short, without these preliminary talks, and the rationality we have shown in the preliminary talks, the future formal naval conference may not be successful." (19th Havas)</p>
<h3>Japanese Representatives Remain in London</h3>
<p>Continuing Technical Discussions</p>
<p>US Representatives Scheduled to Return Home at the End of the Month</p>
<p>(London) Reuters has learned from the US delegation that the US representatives believe that today's communiqué explains the current situation in great detail, summarizes the internal situation accurately, and is able to comprehensively cover the position of the US. The fact that the communiqué does not mention a date for the resumption of talks is particularly comforting to the US. It is reported that from today until the end of the year, British and Japanese representatives will hold talks on technical matters, while the US representatives will leave the UK at the end of the month. British representatives said that this adjournment is a true adjournment. The future goal is to prepare through normal and diplomatic channels for the reopening of discussions before the 1935 General Assembly, so that the General Assembly can be successful. It is expected that the start of diplomatic contact will be after Japan abrogates the Washington Naval Treaty. At that time, what will be discussed will be the British plan based on the exchange of shipbuilding programs. If the opinions of the three countries are close, they will try to resume talks. It is heard that the UK's view on Japan's cancellation of the Washington Naval Treaty is considered extremely serious, but it feels that the declaration of abrogation of the treaty has not diminished the hope of a compromise in the future. The UK has not seen any signs that Japan wants to abolish the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty on the Pacific; it only feels that Japan wants to negotiate a new naval treaty.

<h3>Clever British Tactics</h3>
<p>UK and US Differ on View of Abolition</p>
<p>(London) The preliminary naval talks have come to an end with the joint declaration, but since before and after the talks, the most skillful diplomatic tactics have undoubtedly been those of the British government. It has maintained contact with the Japanese delegation with its compromise trial, and has maintained its close relationship with the US delegation with its neither close nor distant relationship.</p>
<p>As for the views of the UK and US on Japan's abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty, they are completely different. The US delegation believes that abrogation is an act of destroying the collective peace mechanism, while the British government authorities believe that abrogation should be viewed as insignificant as much as possible. The abrogation of a treaty is like terminating a lease agreement and has no other meaning. It is now like staying in the rented house and signing a new lease in order to ensure its favorable conditions. This observation is quite intriguing. (20th Japanese Allied News)</p>
<h3>After Japan Abrogates Treaty</h3>
<p>US Response Steps</p>
<p>Navy Constantly Ready to Take Necessary Actions</p>
<p>Naval Base Seeks to Restore Defensive Works</p>
<p>| Swanson's Statement |</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, members of the press visited Secretary of the Navy Swanson and asked how the US shipbuilding program would proceed after Japan abrogated the Washington Naval Convention. Swanson replied, "Our Navy is always at sea." Swanson also said that according to the terms of the treaty, it will remain in effect for two years after abrogation. We should take the necessary and proper steps to protect the United States and its industries. Swanson also answered another question, stating that the decision to complete the naval base defense program, which was suspended after the signing of the Washington Naval Convention, is now being retained.

<h3>French Foreign Minister Receives Japanese Ambassador</h3>
<p>Discusses Naval Issues</p>
<p>Explains Reasons for Not Being Able to Jointly Abrogate Treaty</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Laval held a lengthy talk with the Japanese Ambassador to France to discuss the adjournment of the naval talks and the Japanese cabinet's decision to announce the abrogation of the naval treaty. Mr. Laval reiterated that France, due to diplomatic and strategic considerations, could not take joint action to abrogate the Washington Naval Treaty. (20th National News)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of British and American Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Japan Threatens World Peace</p>
<p>Adjournment is a Sign of Failure</p>
<p>(Washington) Republican Senator Borah believes that Japan's announcement of the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty is regrettable, but the United States cannot infer from this that Japan is adopting a challenging attitude towards the United States. Senator Steiwer of Oregon said that Japan's attitude is a threat to peace, but his tone is still moderate. As for the New York Post, it said that Japan is defying all countries in the world. The World Telegram said that the world is about to engage in an arms race, and the initiator is Japan. The State Department made no comment on the decision of the Japanese Privy Council. (Note: The Japanese Privy Council held a meeting in the Imperial Presence today and unanimously endorsed the Japanese government's decision to abrogate the Washington Naval Treaty.) It is generally believed that the naval powers will reopen the conference in 1936, and Soviet Russia may also participate. We should wait quietly for this period to come. Before 1936, the naval arms race will not begin, because until 1936, the principles set by the Washington Naval Treaty will still be observed by other signatories and Washington. (Note: The Washington Naval Treaty must be announced for abrogation two years before the expiration date, but it will continue to be valid for two years after the announcement of abrogation.) (19th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Most newspapers here have commented on the announcement of the adjournment of the naval talks this morning. The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, and the Liberal news organ, The News Chronicle, both believe that the adjournment is a sign of failure. (20th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Those criticizing the adjournment of the naval talks today all lament that there were no more obvious results, but they acknowledge that these talks have laid the foundation for future negotiations. They believe that since the Washington Naval Treaty still has two years of validity, there is ample time to find a way to replace the arms race. The Times of London said that the diplomacy of the British representatives was indeed proper. Their role as mediators has earned them considerable trust from both the US and Japan, and the falsity and harmfulness of the British-Japanese secret agreement is self-evident. The Washington Treaty has given the signatories many benefits. Now that Tokyo has abolished it, it bears a heavy responsibility. However, since Tokyo has said that the abrogation of the treaty is only a means of concluding a new treaty, it can be seen that the three countries have one purpose, namely to establish a new treaty as good as the old one. The Daily Telegraph mentioned the issue of face, saying that trying to satisfy the feelings of the Japanese, who are ashamed and angry, will make the hope of resolving major issues in the Far East turn into a mirage. The current stalemate, which is not yet dangerous, may easily become dangerous. If the solution remains unresolved, then Britain and its autonomous territories must jointly deliberate on the most difficult British Empire policy problem rarely encountered by British politicians.

<h3>US Builds New Type of Aircraft Carrier</h3>
<p>Oil Tank Retrofitting Postpones Launch</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson stated today that the launch of the US's newest aircraft carrier, the USS Ranger, has been postponed for several months. Secretary Swanson stated that the steel used to build the ship's fuel tanks is susceptible to corrosion from gasoline, so it must all be replaced. Navy officials hope that the USS Ranger can participate in naval exercises to be held in the North Pacific next May. (19th National Press)</p>
<h3>Defense of Panama Canal is of Utmost Importance</h3>
<p>Twenty Suicide Squads Can Destroy it in Half a Day</p>
<p>Japanese Fishermen Using Weighted Lines to Measure Depth</p>
<p>American Magazine Publishes Article Urging People to Wake Up</p>
<p>(New York) The owner of the Panama American Magazine, published in Panama City, Panama, Lance Vaneval, stated here today that a suicide squad of twenty people could destroy the Panama Canal into powder within twelve hours. This action is easy to accomplish, but the result could make the canal unusable for commercial shipping for a long time. Although repairs can be carried out immediately, it cannot be opened soon, because there are still some important locations in the canal that are completely undefended. The Panama American Magazine has repeatedly published articles urging people to wake up. Although the army authorities have now increased the defense forces, the most important locations still have no defenses. Mr. Lance went on to say that 75 percent of the Japanese living in the Canal Zone have no fixed income. Barbershops do not cut a single hair all day, shirt factories do not sell a single shirt all day, and restaurants do not cook a single dish all day. The fishing rods used by fishermen are made of steel wire and lead bait, with no hooks at the end, so their work is clearly measuring the depth of the canal. The army chief is unwilling to inform civilians of more appropriate ways to protect the canal, so he is indifferent to his articles. The defense of the Panama Canal is almost entirely the responsibility of the US Army in peacetime. Although the Navy has some affiliated warships patrolling various parts of Central America, they are in no way related to the defense of the Panama Canal. (19th National News)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Has No Intention of Opening a New Canal</h3>
<p>Answering Questions with Humorous Tone</p>
<p>(Washington) When a guest asked President Roosevelt for his candid opinion on the excavation of the Nicaragua Canal, Mr. Roosevelt replied in a humorous tone, saying that the old Nicaragua Canal Company stocks in his house were so many that they were enough to wallpaper a large room. Mr. Roosevelt's words referred to the previous plans to excavate the canal. The right of the United States to excavate the Nicaragua Canal was obtained in 1916 by signing a treaty with Nicaragua for US$3 million, the use of which must be supervised by the United States. There was a Pacific Railroad along the canal route owned by Nicaragua, but its shares were 51% owned by New York bankers, who then resold them to the American public. When the canal plan failed, these stocks became worthless. President Roosevelt's statement today shows that the government has no intention of opening this canal at this time.

<h3>British Prime Minister Writes on the Crisis of War</h3>
<p>Arms Race Cannot Be Prevented</p>
<p>Unilateral Disarmament Does Not Help Peace</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister MacDonald warned today that if Britain replenishes its national defense but cannot avoid the European arms race, then a second European war is unavoidable. The Prime Minister sent this idea in an article to be published in the December issue of the National Labour Party magazine, which was published today. Although the Prime Minister insisted on avoiding the arms race, he also did not agree with setting an example of disarmament, saying that setting an example of disarmament in the eyes of the international community does not help peace. Although Britain has worked hard on disarmament as an advocate for the world, peace is still far away when Britain destroys its last battleship and bomber, and Britain's peace efforts at this time will be in vain.

<p>(Moscow) The protocols signed by Laval and Litvinov in Geneva on December 5 have been announced here as follows:</p>
<p>After exchanging views on the negotiation of the Eastern European Pact, Laval and Litvinov stated that both governments have decided to work towards the conclusion of this pact. At the same time, during the negotiations, both countries are willing to abide by the following principles:</p>
<p>(1) Both governments shall not agree to negotiations with governments invited to join the pact, especially those who have not yet expressed their agreement in principle, for the conclusion of agreements that may hinder the Eastern Regional Pact or are related to it. At the same time, they shall not agree to the conclusion of agreements that are contrary to the spirit held by both governments.</p>
<p>(2) Therefore, both governments shall notify each other of any suggestions made by the government in question to any country that contains such meaning, regardless of the manner in which the suggestion is made.</p>
<p>The protocol stipulates that the same principles and the same objectives shall be observed during and after the negotiation of the aforementioned pact. The above obligations shall be valid in other events that can replace the current activities. Both governments shall not abandon this activity unless they unanimously agree that it is no longer necessary to continue. If both parties believe that this measure is indeed no longer necessary to continue, they shall consult on new guarantees suitable for both parties in the same spirit and purpose.</p>
<p>Both governments firmly believe that the continued and effective guarantee of this Franco-Soviet diplomatic cooperation will be beneficial to the success of the current international negotiations and will strengthen the spirit of mutual trust between the two governments and the two countries.

<p>(Moscow) After negotiations on commercial issues between Rosenholz, the Soviet Commissioner of Foreign Trade, and Marchandeau, the French Minister of Commerce and Industry, the Franco-Soviet Commercial Protocol was signed in Moscow on December 9 and came into effect on the 9th. The full text has been announced here. The protocol stipulates that both parties shall begin negotiations as soon as possible to conclude a treaty of commerce and navigation and shall immediately seek to replace the temporary commercial agreement concluded on January 11, 1934, with an agreement of the same nature. For the purpose of concluding this agreement, the following recommendations shall be considered. These recommendations may be regarded as the basis for a new agreement, namely, that the Soviet Union should be allowed to borrow loans on the French market, and the amount, conditions, period and interest rate, etc., must be stipulated later. The loan period must be sufficient, and the interest rate must be normal. Its use is to order goods from French factories, which must be paid within one year. The issue of loan guarantees for French exporters has also been discussed. If this new commercial treaty is not signed before January 1, 1935, the original temporary commercial agreement will continue next year until the new treaty is signed as soon as possible.

<h3>Agenda of the Eighty-Fourth Session of the League of Nations Council</h3>
<p>To Be Convened in Mid-January Next Year</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Executive Council of the League of Nations has decided to hold the 84th regular session on January 11, 1925. The agenda has recently been announced: (1) The issue of the protection of minorities in Albania (The Albanian government recently ordered the abolition of all private schools in the country and replaced them with national schools, which aroused opposition from most of the minorities in the country. At the end of last month, representatives from Peru, Mexico, and the United Kingdom requested the League of Nations to include this matter on the agenda.) (2) The issue of the German minority in the Upper Silesia Province of Poland (Upper Silesia was originally part of Germany, and part of it was assigned to Poland after the war.) (3) The issue of the resettlement of the Assyrian minority in Iraq. (4) The most important issue of the Saar plebiscite. This vote is scheduled to be held on January 13, and the results can be revealed in Geneva on the evening of that day. As for the application submitted by Yugoslavia due to the Marseilles assassination, although it is not included in the agenda of the Executive Council, the British Lord Privy Seal, Eden (i.e., the rapporteur), will report on the implementation of the resolution passed by the Executive Council at its last meeting to resolve the dispute between the two countries of South and Hungary by the Hungarian government.

It also stated that the Italians were the aggressors in Ururu, and that three days after the war in Ururu, another battle occurred in the interior, which was also provoked by troops from Italian Somaliland. These are the two major issues that the League of Nations should resolve. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian government sent a telegram to the League of Nations, which has now been announced by the Secretariat of the League of Nations. The telegram stated that the Anglo-Abyssinian Border Commission will refute the Italian document, because the provocative behavior of Italian officers will cause the British Commissioner to join the Abyssinian Commissioner in protesting, proving that Italian aircraft first flew to Abyssinian military camps to drop bombs and open machine guns. The League of Nations believes that this incident is serious. If Italy continues to refuse arbitration, Abyssinia will submit the entire dispute to the League of Nations for handling.

<h3>Former Yugoslav Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Ordered to Form a New Cabinet</p>
<p>Belgrade Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, has now formally commissioned former Foreign Minister Yevtich to rise up and form a new cabinet. Yevtich entered the palace at noon today to see the Regent. After leaving the palace, he began to contact all parties. Former leaders of the Slovenian Party, Koroshets, and former cabinet members of the extremist faction, Milotic, are all being contacted. This proves that the previous legend that the Regent has instructed Yevtich to form a cabinet can be freely disposed of is reliable. It is said that the purpose of Yevtich's formation of a new cabinet is to create a concentrated cabinet of all factions, which will not only include the opposition faction in the parliament, but also recruit people from the previously disbanded political parties. Furthermore, Yevtich is neither a member of the Senate nor a member of the House of Representatives, and he was also a confidential advisor to the former King Alexander. After Alexander's death, this position was retained in the regency, so Yevtich's position is extremely high, and the convenience of his work is even more obvious. Furthermore, the success of Yevtich's formation of a cabinet is even more predictable because Yevtich has a close relationship with General Zhivkovich, the Chief of the Army, and the general's power is also extremely certain in the Yugoslav political arena.

<h3>On the Issue of the Eastern European Pact</h3>
<p>Germany Expresses Its Attitude</p>
<p>Rome German Foreign Minister Neurath made a statement to the Italian "Messenger Report" reporter in Saar, generally saying that he believes that France has sincerity and goodwill regarding the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. Neurath believes that if a conflict occurs between the signatory countries, and Germany must send troops to intervene to ensure the permanent invariance of Eastern European territory and politics, then Germany will never agree. When the reporter asked how the Four-Power Pact of England, France, Italy and Germany in 1933 (signed in Rome on July 15) would be joined by other countries such as the Little Entente countries, Neurath politely declined, saying that he hoped not to ask any further questions on this point.

<h3>British Newspaper Discusses the Silver Issue</h3>
<p>(London) The Financial Times published an editorial today stating that since President Roosevelt's silver purchase plan was announced, the silver market has become a largely "paper" market. The amount of silver purchased by the United States is not as much as speculators expected for its price to rise, and coupled with unstable news from China, buyers have become helpless. All of these factors seem to prove that the price of silver will not last long. The newspaper also said that if Sir Sassoon of Shanghai's opinion can be implemented, it can not only alleviate China's difficulties, but also not hinder the United States from proceeding with its silver program. London has no certainty that this opinion will be adopted by President Roosevelt. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Discovers a Gold Bar Smuggling Ring</h3>
<p>Two Chinese Arrested</p>
<p>Osaka It has recently been discovered that overseas Chinese in Japan have organized a smuggling ring to smuggle gold bars worth one million yuan. When the Japanese mail ship Shanghai liner Ikoma Maru was docked at the Osaka Port on the afternoon of the 17th, a Chinese man carried a cloth bag onto the ship and put it in the coal bunker and left. The crew suspected his actions and checked his bag, and found 52 gold bars, each six inches long and one inch wide, worth 160,000 yuan at the current price. Therefore, they reported to the police and arrested two Chinese men. As a result of the interrogation, it was provided that the leader of the smuggling ring was Shen Xieji, the owner of Wan Yi Hao, a food and trade merchant in Sakae-cho, Kobe. The authorities immediately sent personnel to search his residence and confiscated 40,000 yuan worth of gold bars and other evidence. However, Shen Yeyu took the Shanghai Maru from Kobe to Shanghai on the 17th, and the authorities relied on wireless</p>
<p>electricity to rely on the captain to arrest the criminal. It is said that Shen is in contact with the headquarters of the smuggling ring in the French Concession of Shanghai, and has so far transported more than one million yuan in gold bars. (20th Japanese Allied Telegram)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Gained Weight</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US government believes that the presidential office of the President of the United States is unparalleled in its burden. Some former presidents have fallen ill in office, and some have died in office. President Roosevelt has shouldered the heavy responsibility of revitalization and has worked hard for the country. However, he can handle it competently and happily. President Roosevelt has a physical examination once a year. The doctor finished the examination today and said that his health is even better than when he took office. His weight is 170</p>
<p>Seventy-two pounds can also be said to be a good omen. The president is overworked, and the physical examination has been delayed for two weeks, and it has only been held today. The president declared today that the Congress is about to open, and the government affairs are complicated. He will not have time to do "fireside chats" on the radio before the Congress opens.

<h3>He Chengjun Arrives in Hankou Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun arrived in Hankou by Jiangxin from Beijing at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th. Chen Guangzu, Chen Hancun, and others were waiting at the port to greet him. He returned to his residence to rest. According to the results of the Fifth Plenary Session, the results were very satisfactory. Liu Xiang presented his plan for governing Sichuan and suppressing bandits in detail, which was highly appreciated by the central government. After careful planning, the central government decided to suppress the bandits again to try to gather the bandits. Liu Duban believed that the results of this trip were satisfactory, so he returned to Sichuan first to deploy everything. The central government also promised to subsidize the Sichuan army with temporary expenses on a monthly basis during the bandit suppression period. As for the bandits who fled from western Jiangxi, after being severely attacked by the Xiang and Gui troops and the chasing troops several times, they have no combat capability. They have recently fled to the border of Guizhou. There are only sporadic small bandits in Xiang territory, but because their main forces have lost contact, they are not enough to be a threat. As for drug prohibition, it is more urgent in Hubei than in other provinces. I hope that the people will work hard and strive to save themselves and the country. In addition, Li Tiancai and others, who were accompanying Zhang Xueliang, also returned to Hankou on the same wheel. (20th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Northwest Inspection Notes by Our Special Correspondent Geng Ya</h3>
<p>Overview of Hami</p>
<p>(I) Historical Background: Hami was the land of Iwoluo during the Han Dynasty, belonging to the Xiongnu. Emperor Ming conquered it, establishing the Yihuo Commandant. During the Three Kingdoms period, it belonged to the Xianbei. Zhang Jun of the Former Liang Dynasty of the Jin Dynasty occupied it. During the Northern Wei Dynasty, it belonged to the Rouran. In the twelfth year of Emperor Wen's Taihe reign, it became affiliated with the city. Later, the Later Wei Dynasty became Shanshan and Turpan. The Western Turks occupied it. In the sixth year of Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty, the Yiwu Prefecture was established. After the Sui Dynasty's chaos, it was again occupied by the Western Turks. In the fourth year of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, it surrendered and the Xi Yizhou was established. Later, it was renamed Yizhou. In the early years of Tianbao, it became Yiwu Prefecture. In the early years of Qianyuan, it was restored to Yizhou (governing the three counties of Yiwu, Rouyuan, and Nazhi). After Guangde, it was lost to Tubo. The Chen family occupied its land. From the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty until the early Song Dynasty, it lasted for ten generations. After Yongxi, it belonged to the Asalan Uyghur of Xizhou. During the Yuan Dynasty, it was called Hamil, under the control of the Uyghur of Huozhou. In the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, Chief Anke Temuer surrendered and was enfeoffed as the Prince of Zhongshun, establishing the Hami Guard. After Zhengde, it was occupied by Chief Mangsur of Tubo, who closed the Jiayu Pass and abandoned Hami. Later, it re-affiliated with the early Qing Dynasty. The Hami Guard Hui and Er Du surrendered. When it came to Tuluntai as king, he assisted Guo Dong of the Hexi Hui in rebellion and was executed. In the twenty-sixth year of Kangxi, Chief Erbeidula captured and offered Galdan's son, and was granted the Zhasake seal, beginning its internal affiliation. During the Qianlong reign, the Hami Office was established. In the early years of Guangxu, it was changed to a province and promoted to a directly governed office. In the second year of the Republic of China, it was changed to Hami County, with three cities: Hui, Han, and Xin, forming a triangular formation. The Hui and Han cities are very high and solid. The ramparts of the Xin city were mostly destroyed.</p>
<p>(II) Area: It is 1,015 li long from east to west and varies in width from north to south, with some parts as wide as 950 li. The area is at least over 400,000 square li.</p>
<p>(III) Population: The entire county has 3,108 households of Chanshi people, totaling 17,728 people. There are 218 households of Han people, totaling 723 people. There are 340 households of Hui people, totaling 586 people. Statistics show approximately 3,600 households, with over 20,000 people. (Note: There are over 5,000 yurts of Kazakhs within the territory, with each household having between three and five people. Their livelihood is nomadic and unstable, so they are not included in the fixed population count.)</p>
<p>(IV) Mountains, Rivers, and Terrain: There are two rivers flowing in the suburbs of the city area. One is called "Subashi River," originating from Subashi Lake, four li north of the city. The lake is crescent-shaped, with springs gushing year-round without drying up. The area is ten zhang higher than the plain. The spring water flows southwest, encircling the north of the city, dividing into three canals to irrigate the suburbs, vegetable gardens, and melon fields, benefiting the farmers. The other is called "Shenbatu River," originating from the Elm Tree Gully of the East Mountain north of the city, flowing through the villages of Shichengzi, Xiaowan, and Sebashi, irrigating over a thousand mu of land. Initially, it flows southeast, then turns southwest, encircling the south of the city and entering Xiaonan Lake, merging with the Subashi River to the South Lake (70 li south of the city), and then disappearing into the sand. The terrain of Hami is high in the northeast and flat and low in the southwest, shaped like a rolled mat. There are no villages in the southeast, being an endless Gobi Desert. Villages are distributed in the southwest like scattered chess pieces. The northeast and northwest are the continuous areas of the eastern part of the Tianshan Mountains, with towering peaks, known as natural barriers. The Chanshi people use it as a base.</p>
<p>(V) Commerce: Hami's commerce is still in its nascent stage. Its social organization and commercial elements account for only about 2% of the population. Apart from the local Chanshi and Hui people, there are only a dozen or so merchants from Pingjin, Jin, and Sui. The goods they trade in are nothing more than brick tea, cigarettes, and cloth. Furthermore, due to the impact of finance, they cannot engage in fixed trade. The market lacks cash, and the value of provincial notes fluctuates unpredictably, thus promoting a state of exchange between goods and raw materials. For example, merchants from Pingjin, Jin, and Sui exchange tea bricks, cigarettes, silk, and other goods for the sheepskin, wool, camel hair, dried melon, and raisins of the Chanshi people. Since the center of commerce is biased towards mutual exchange of goods, cash transactions gradually become sluggish and quiet. At the same time, the market price of goods entering and leaving also increases daily. The market prices of major imports and exports for September of this year are listed as follows (in yuan):</p>
<p>Exports: Camel Hair 20.00 (per 100 catties)</p>
<p>Wool 1.40 (per 100 catties)</p>
<p>Lambskin 0.30 (per piece)</p>
<p>Cotton 16.00 (per 100 catties)</p>
<p>Raisins 20.00 (per 100 catties)</p>
<p>Fox Fur 4.00 (per piece)</p>
<p>Imports: Brick Tea 2.20 (per brick)</p>
<p>Secondary Tea 2.50 (per brick)</p>
<p>Cigarettes (Hatamen) 3.00 (per pack)</p>
<p>Sugar 0.50 (per catty)</p>
<p>Cloth (Russian goods, such as printed cloth) 0.15 (per dang, approximately 2 chi long)</p>
<p>In recent months, because raw materials are almost exhausted and goods are becoming increasingly difficult to sell, there will be a return to cash transactions. Therefore, although the value of provincial notes was as low as 500 taels (per yuan) in September, it has now returned to 400 taels. At the same time, the prices of the above-listed imported goods are also gradually falling. However, considering the obstructed transportation and the difficulty of sourcing goods, the increase in the price of goods and the decrease in the value of provincial notes will still be a phenomenon that Hami will inevitably see in the future. Fortunately, recently, the new Sui automobiles can now reach Hami, and the province plans to open traffic to Hami to connect with the new Sui route. In the future, Hami's commerce will definitely have considerable development.</p>
<p>There is one thing that urgently needs attention: how to develop commerce in the border areas. Chinese merchants have traditionally lacked organization and have few long-term plans. Their initial motivation for doing business in the border areas is merely to seek double the profit, with the driving force coming from selfishness and self-interest. Therefore, merchants here often say, "Business today is much worse than when we followed Zuo Zongtang's army as merchants (Gan Daying). In the past, there were no taxes, but now there are tax checkpoints everywhere. In the past, profits were ten times higher, but now we worry about losses and even bankruptcy." Listening to their words, it can be seen that the crisis facing Chinese merchants is becoming increasingly acute. Now, the border market is increasingly open, and recently, the Soviet Union, which is close at hand, has reached an agreement to establish an international trading company in Hami. If unorganized and unplanned Chinese merchants compete with foreign merchants who have vast capital and strict organization, their inferior situation and defeat are inevitable.</p>
<p>(VI) Rural Economy: Although Hami has a vast area, arable land accounts for only about 1% of the total area. Currently, there are rural areas and arable land in the northeast district, including Qincheng, Jiji Tai, Tuhulu, Naomao Lake, Huanglu Gang, Yikeshu, Shichengzi, and Yushugou. The southwest district includes the various forts from Tou Er San Si Wu and Da Xiaonan Lake. The northwest includes the various gulleys from Yi Er San Si Wu Liu Qi Ba Jiu and Shazao Yuan. There are approximately 3,000 farming households, with over 90,000 mu of arable land. On average, each household can cultivate 30 mu of land. Each stone of arable land can sow two stones of seeds and harvest twenty stones. Each stone is valued at 7,000 taels of provincial notes (equivalent to 17.5 yuan). After paying a tax of 5% (i.e., eight dou of wheat are collected for each stone of arable land), the annual harvest is valued at over 300 yuan. The living conditions of farmers here are actually better than in other provinces, and the burden is also lighter than elsewhere. Tenant farmers account for approximately 5% of the total number of farmers in the county. Their treatment and wages, such as for annual laborers, were 30 to 40 yuan per person ten years ago, but now, due to the sharp drop in the value of the provincial notes, they are only worth about 10 yuan. However, meals are provided, and sometimes this includes children and wives. Long-term workers receive 1,000 taels of provincial notes per month (equivalent to 2.5 yuan), and short-term workers receive 100 taels per day (equivalent to 0.25 yuan), with meals provided, and some even provide clothing. In addition to a large amount of wheat, rural production also includes animal husbandry. Taking sheep as an example, the annual production is approximately 200,000 heads. On average, each household can raise 70 sheep. Each sheep is valued at 4.5 yuan (the annual wool production is four catties, worth a total of 50 cents, each sheepskin is worth 40 cents, each sheep intestine is worth 10 cents, and 20 catties of mutton are worth 4 yuan).</p>
<p>In total, it is valued at approximately 305 yuan. If scientific methods are used and properly managed, the annual output should be more than this. In addition, the annual production of dried melons and camel hair is also significant. Therefore, the rural society of Hami is still in a feudal and relatively well-off state.</p>
<p>The sources of wealth in Hami's rural economy are: (1) the benefits of irrigation from the snowmelt of the Tianshan Mountains. The eastern part of the Tianshan Mountains spans the county, and snow accumulates year-round. When it melts in spring and summer, the southern flow becomes canal water, and all arable land is irrigated. The northern flow becomes the Caohu Lake, with lush water and grass, suitable for animal husbandry. The recent eastward migration of the Kazakhs is also because the water and grass on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains can be used for living. (2) The feudal barriers in the countryside have not yet been broken by capitalist forces, so in a certain sense, they still present a relatively well-off phenomenon. The Chanshi and Hui people of Hami are mostly natives, that is, a type of Oirat people. They are peaceful, hardworking, and both men and women can engage in labor. Moreover, since Abedula ascended the throne, passing through more than ten generations, the people's cultivated land is all received from the Wangfu, and the Wangfu's land is mostly fertile. (3) The population is sparse. Considering the total area of Hami, an average of one person occupies 80 square li. The sparseness of the population can be said to be extreme. As for the wealth of the Chanshi people and the slowness of population reproduction, it is actually inversely proportional.</p>
<p>(VII) Products: Since Hami's social organization is centered on agriculture, its main production is also dominated by agricultural products. The annual production of the county's main agricultural products is estimated to be 180,000 stones of wheat, 230,000 catties of Hami melons, 200,000 sheepskins, 1,000,000 catties of wool, and 150,000 catties of camel hair. In addition, there is also the production of grapes, apples, cabbage, etc., but the quantity is not large. The coal mines in Sandao Ling, 180 li west of the city, originally produced coal, but the mines are low and humid, making mining difficult. The local people dig and extract coal at any time, and the production volume is not accurately统计.</p>
<p>(VIII) The Evolution, Organization, and Current Status of the Hui King: The Zhasake Prince of Hami Hui has two surnames, the ancestor of whom was Ebeidula (first enfeoffed in the 26th year of the Kangxi reign). He was followed by Guobo, then Emin, then Yu'anbu, then Yisake, then Erdesier, then Besier, then Maihamote, then Shmahusote, then Niezi'er, then Besier. The organization consists of two Taiji, who manage military and political affairs; one Kezai, who is in charge of justice; two Mibola, who manage rural water conservancy; 24 Duerga, who manage taxation; 24 Maochi, whose management matters are the same as those of the Duerga, but their powers are smaller and are subject to the command of the Duerga; and 24 Gu Luoman'er, who are assistants to the Maochi. When Shmahusote (that is, the current King Besier's grandfather) was alive, he was able to cooperate well with the province, so his feudal power was also unbreakable. When Jin Shuren governed the new province, he planned to establish Yiwu County in Tuhulu, 300 li north of Hami City, and Yihe County in Sanbao, 180 li west of the city, combining Hami into three counties. He began to measure land, as a preliminary step for establishing governance. The plan was quite complete, but due to repeated irregularities in implementation, conflicts arose with the Hui King's feudal system. Moreover, the fertile land within the territory was owned by the royal family, Taiji, Duerga, etc. As a result, in the 20th year, a peasant revolution-like incident broke out in Hami. On the one hand, it was a head-on conflict between the royal family and officials over land ownership; on the other hand, the royal family and officials fanned the flames and incited competition for national survival, resulting in a complex and chaotic situation that has not yet been fully stabilized.</p>
<p>The current successor to the throne is Besier, the son of Niezi'er. Besier is still young and in poor spirits, and many members of the clan look down on him. His traditional feudalism is now only a remnant of its former self. Moreover, on the other hand, the emerging ruling power of the Chanshi people has turned to other aspects, such as Hojani Yazi, the current deputy chairman of the provincial government, and Yao Leshi, the commander of the Hami garrison. Based on this speculation, the royal autocracy will also "reach its end."</p>
<h3>Illegal Parade by Koreans in Beiping</h3>
<p>Resentment Against Authorities for Drug Suppression,</p>
<p>Public Demonstration After Assaulting a Tram Conductor</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Since the strict implementation of the drug prohibition policy in the former capital, the authorities have found it particularly difficult to arrest Korean drug dealers. Although the Japanese police ostensibly claim to cooperate with the Chinese authorities in making arrests, in reality, Koreans still receive protection from the Japanese. Recently, cases of Koreans resisting inspections and disobeying arrests by Chinese police have been occurring frequently. Today (18th), another bizarre case of Korean lawlessness occurred. A Korean resident, Kim Dingchen, residing at No. 24 Houcher Hutong, Xizhimen Inner, had a neighbor at No. 23, Duan Jinyu, who was a ticket seller for the tram company. The Korean Kim often engaged in drug dealing, and given the recent arrests of many Korean drug dealers, he felt quite aggrieved. One day, he suddenly saw Duan returning home wearing a blue uniform, and mistakenly identified Duan as a police officer from the Public Security Bureau. Today (18th), he waited in front of his door with a wooden stick. Just as Duan returned from work, Kim suddenly struck Duan on the head from behind with the stick, causing immediate bleeding and a serious injury that knocked Duan to the ground. He was rescued by Inspector Li Songlin of the Fourth District and sent to the Central Hospital for treatment. Kim, seeing the trouble he had caused, not only showed no fear but also gathered more than ten unemployed Koreans and went to the Yichangyong Hotel on Xisi Street to assemble. They then marched in formation and demonstrated on Mashi Street, Yangshi Street, Shuaifu Hutong, and Jinger Hutong, wielding wooden sticks and uttering disrespectful words, as if deliberately provoking trouble. When our police saw this, knowing that reasoning would be futile, they followed secretly, monitoring the situation while providing peaceful protection. This also shows a glimpse of the situation in North China. (18th)</p>
<h3>Illegal Organization Discovered in Jixian, War Zone</h3>
<p>Actually a So-Called Party of the Poor</p>
<p>Demanding the Abolition of All Taxes</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Recently, a so-called "Party of the Poor," an illegal organization, was suddenly discovered in Jixian. Members of this party, besides local thugs and traitors, also included communist elements. The exact number is not known, but it is estimated to be about four hundred. Their declared aim is "to oppose the payment of any taxes," and they secretly sent party members to Beiping to spread the message. In the past, their activities were secret, so few people knew about them. Recently, the county authorities discovered them. According to a telephone call from Jixian, yesterday (17th) afternoon around 3:00 PM, two people claiming to be "representatives of the Party of the Poor" suddenly went to the county government to petition for a complete exemption from all taxes. County Magistrate Wang Gongbin, because the representatives' origins were unclear, detained them and interrogated them about the "party" organization. Their confessions were roughly as described above. They were placed under guard. In the evening, more than a hundred people claiming to be members of the "Party of the Poor" surrounded the county government, demanding the release of the two representatives, and indicating that if there was no result, they would take certain actions. The county government sent personnel to explain that the matter would be answered after obtaining instructions from higher officials. Until this morning (18th) around 1:00 AM, the county government was still surrounded. After receiving the report, the authorities here were extremely angry. This morning (18th), they instructed the directly governing agency to deal with the matter severely to maintain public order. (18th)</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Recovered Areas Still Urgently Need Relief</h3>
<p>The Provincial Relief Committee Formulates Measures</p>
<p>Appealing to Charitable Organizations to Assist</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The bandit scourge in Jiangxi lasted for eight years, and after a single suppression, the remaining devastated heavy bandit areas occupy nearly half of the province's area. Each newly recovered area has either been devastated by the Red bandits for a long time, or has been a battlefield for a long time, or has been the rear of the bandits. Houses have been destroyed, stoves have been extinguished, and people have fled. Everywhere is ashes, houses are mounds, and bodies are exposed in the wilderness, gnawed by dogs and wolves, with starving people lying on the road, on the verge of death. There is an urgent need for relief with warm clothing, medicine, and food, with no time to spare. The Provincial Relief Committee specially appeals to charitable organizations from all over to come and provide emergency relief. The measures formulated are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Burial: The counties of Huichang, Ruijin, Yudu, Ningdu, Guangchang, as well as Hengfeng, Yiyang, Dexing, Leping, Shangrao, Wannian, and Yujiang in eastern Jiangxi, and the counties and towns listed above, are all newly recovered. The fighting has just ended, corpses lie everywhere, and brains and organs are splattered on the ground, a tragic sight. On average, each county and district needs two burial teams, each with five people, with each person receiving two jiao of wages and food per day. For two weeks, this would cost about 8,000 yuan. Medical Care: In the newly recovered areas listed above, as well as refugee centers in Guangchang's Xinan, Toubei Spring, Ningdu's Luokou, Changsheng, etc., temporary clinics have been set up. On average, each needs about 1,000 yuan in medicine expenses.</p>
<p>Emergency Relief: The counties of Ningdu, Shicheng, Ruijin, Yudu, Huichang, Yiyang, Hengfeng, Leping, and Dexing have been severely affected by bandit disasters, and the refugees are the most miserable. On average, each county needs about 3,000 yuan in emergency relief, assuming 2,000 people per county. Also, the counties of Guangchang, Fuliang, Ganxian, Xunwu, Anyuan, Xiushui, Tonggu, Yushan, Guangfeng, Yangxi, Tengtian, Cihua, Wannian, Guixi, Yujiang, Wuyuan, Shangrao, Qianshan, Jiujiang, Ruichang, Suichuan, Wan'an, Ji'an, Taihe, Lianhua, Xiajiang, Xinyu, and Pengze are secondary heavy bandit and drought-stricken areas. On average, each county needs about 2,000 yuan in relief money, assuming 2,000 people per county. As for the method of providing relief, personnel should be sent to conduct on-site assessments and provide relief in exchange for labor, such as repairing embankments and building roads, or lending cattle and seeds for agricultural relief loans. If emergency relief is adopted, it should be done in accordance with the temporary relief distribution methods of this committee.</p>
<p>Shelter: Shelters should be established in suitable locations where refugees from bandit areas can gather widely. In addition to the shelters established by the Provincial Relief Committee in Xingguo, Guangchang, Yudu, Hengfeng, Shangrao, Wannian, Nanfeng, Nancheng, Linchuan, Leping, Dexing, Lianhua, and Ji'an, it is found that there are still several mouths in Ruijin, Huichang, and the Ge Yuan and Fang Dun areas on the border between Hengfeng and Yiyang, where two shelters should be established as necessary. One shelter should be established in Fulin, on the border between the two counties of Wan and Yu, to provide shelter. On average, each shelter can accommodate 3,000 people, which would cost about 12,000 yuan for two months. Warm Clothing: The counties of Ningdu, Ruijin, Shicheng, Huichang, Xingguo, Yudu, and Guangchang have been occupied by bandits for years and have just been recovered. Refugees are returning, and it is the middle of winter. Many are freezing to death because they do not have adequate clothing. In addition to the 10,000 pieces of warm clothing raised by the provincial government from all sectors of society and distributed by the Relief Committee, it is reported that the number of refugees is increasing daily. On average, each county (Ruichang, Huichang, Yudu, Xingguo, Ningdu, and Shicheng) still needs about 2,000 sets of clothing. Furthermore, the newly recovered Fang Dun in Yiyang County, Ge Yuan in Hengfeng County, Lijiatan in Shangrao County, Huanggang in Leping County, Huangpaiwei in Dexing County, Fulin in Wannian County, Daqiao in Yujiang County, and several special districts such as Tengtian, Cihua, and Yangxi are mostly tragic bandit areas. On average, each of the above places also needs 2,000 sets of warm clothing.</p>
<p>Distributing Relief: All of the above-listed areas are the most severely affected and in need of relief. Areas that were previously affected by disasters and have already received relief, and areas that are less severely affected and do not need relief for the time being, have not been included. With the exception of the four counties of Yudu, Huichang, Ningdu, etc., where the highways currently under construction have not yet opened to traffic, new recovered counties and districts such as Guangchang, Hengfeng, Yiyang, Leping, Dexing, Fuliang, Xiushui, Tonggu, Yushan, Qianshan, Wannian, Guixi, Yujiang, Shangrao, Suichuan, Wan'an, Ji'an, Taihe, Ganxian, Lianhua, Xiajiang, Xinyu, Tengtian, Cihua, etc., can be reached directly by car. The counties of Jiujiang, Duchang, and Pengze (drought-stricken) have the convenience of railways and ships. Xunwu is relatively far away, but the counties and districts of Wuyuan and Yangxi can also be reached by car. The journey is peaceful and safe, so you can go to inspect and distribute relief.

<p>Negotiations Underway Regarding Farmer Injured by Car</p>
<p>On the 16th of this month, there was an incident on the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway in the Caoxing section where a farmer was killed by a car. It has been learned that the farmer was from the 12th Tu of Fahua Bridge in Fengxian County. He was walking on the highway and was accidentally hit by car number 6363 from Shanghai, injuring his head. Blood flowed all over the ground, and he fell into a coma. Someone telegraphed the Minhang Station to detain the car. The township police of the Tu are now negotiating with the car owner who caused the accident. The injured farmer has also been sent for medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Farmers in Caoxing Robbed and Injured</h3>
<p>On the night of the 13th, around 12:00 AM, the home of Lu Qiulin, a farmer from the 7th Tu of Shaxi, Caoxing, was suddenly broken into by seven or eight local-accented bandits, each wielding an iron bar. They forced the victim to hand over his hidden silver. However, Lu did not have any savings, so he was beaten on his limbs. The bandits then robbed him of cloth clothes, money ornaments, and other items, and fled with the stolen goods. The incident was reported to the responsible branch station, which sent police to investigate and confirmed the facts. They issued a loss report and requested the county Public Security Bureau to pursue the robbers.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Two Robbery Cases Solved in One Day</p>
<p>On the 19th, the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau captured six robbers, Zhang Shaoding, Wang Kesheng, Liu Decheng, Zhang Shaohe, Xu Yangmin, and Jiang Juwu, in Lengshuiwan, Fengmen, who were involved in the robbery of Ma Chengji's ointment shop in Bifengfang. They also apprehended Li Yushan (also known as Li Mengbai) and Liu Benfu at Shiqiao Head and recovered a handgun from a manure pit. Zhang Shaoding and others confessed to robbing Ma Chengji's ointment shop and Master Tang's residence in Xima Pool. Director Huang of the Second Branch Bureau also searched out stolen gold jewelry, such as bracelets, from Master Tang's robbery case in a manure pit. People sent by Master Tang's household identified the items as the original stolen goods. The Criminal Investigation Team is currently conducting a detailed investigation.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Shenchang Silk Factory Burns Down</p>
<p>The Shenchang Silk Factory, located outside the Guangfu Gate at the East City Foot, was previously established by local residents Yang Zhongzi and Yuan Duanfu. Due to the sharp decline in the silk market, it was unprofitable and closed down last month. Subsequently, Chen Zisun from Suzhou invested money and cooperated with Yang and others to resume operations on the 1st of this month. Unexpectedly, around 11:00 PM on the night before (19th), a sudden fire broke out on the corridor connecting the machine pile and silk room in the factory. Manager Chen Zisun was horrified when he saw the situation and immediately shouted loudly, alarming all the employees in the factory and sounding the alarm. However, in an instant, the fire had spread to the silk room, breaking through the roof. The fire was so fierce that it was impossible to approach. After the fire brigades from various sections arrived and tried their best to extinguish the fire, they managed to save the accounting room and the raw cocoon room. The rest was reduced to ashes, with losses estimated at around 5-6,000 yuan. However, the factory had previously held fire insurance worth 20,000 taels with the Royal Insurance Company of Shanghai but had just canceled the insurance last month. It is said that the cause of the fire was due to the mischief of a deity. Afterwards, the responsible Public Security Second Branch Bureau summoned Manager Chen Zisun of the factory to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Death Case at Xintang Bridge</h3>
<p>A nameless male corpse was found in the river at Xintang Bridge, in the 558th Tu near Dongting in the Second District. The corpse was floating by the river, head down, body face down, with a rope around its neck and a blue stone tied to it. The situation was quite bizarre. The Tu Zheng, Bao Rongqing, came to the city to report to the local branch court for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Shen, leading the examiner Liu, went to the countryside to conduct the autopsy. The autopsy revealed minor injuries on both arms of the deceased, a slight opening in the left eye, an empty stomach, urine discharge, swollen scrotum, and no feces in the anus. It was determined that the deceased had been tied to a blue stone while alive, thrown into the river, and died. After the autopsy, he ordered the Tu Zheng to collect the body and brought the blue stone and all the belongings of the deceased to the court for safekeeping in order to investigate and handle the case.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Notorious Robber Yu Congchang Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Last year, a notorious robber broke into the home of Zhao Qingping, a gentry in Qingguo Lane in Wuyi City, and shot and killed the gatekeeper, He Canhai, with a gun, robbing him of property and other items. After the incident occurred, it caused a sensation for a while. It was generally believed that the robber was very skilled. The county government and the public security organs ordered his arrest. This year, the Public Security First Branch Bureau arrested the principal offender, Yu Congchang, in another case and sent him to the county government for interrogation. The suspect repeatedly denied and recanted his confession. Only recently did he tacitly acknowledge his guilt. The county government proposed a death sentence and submitted it to the provincial government, which telegraphed its approval for execution by firing squad on the 19th. This morning (20th) at 10:00 AM, the county magistrate dispatched police to take the suspect Yu Congchang into custody, verify his identity, and bind him to Fengweidun for execution by firing squad.</p>

<p>Central News Agency: Since its establishment, the Emergency Relief General Donation Association has been busy handling general donations from large, medium, and small schools, Boy Scout general donations, general donations from various trade associations in the business community, and donations from factory staff and workers. Apart from the Boy Scout street collections, which have already ended, other general donations are still in progress. Yesterday, schools came to the association to submit donations, including 53 yuan in silver dollars and 1249 jiao in small coins from the First China Elementary School, 11.5 yuan in silver dollars and 164 jiao in small coins, 867 copper coins from Hualong Elementary School, 24 yuan in silver dollars and 378 jiao in small coins from Qianye Junior High School, 396 jiao in small coins from the Provincial Shanghai Experimental Elementary School, 10 yuan in silver dollars and 246 jiao in small coins from Chaozong Elementary School, 83 yuan in silver dollars and 489 jiao in small coins, 35 copper coins from Qingxin Girls' High School, 1 yuan in silver dollars and 80 jiao in small coins from Minzu Elementary School, 2 yuan in silver dollars and 64 jiao in small coins from Shagang Elementary School, 74.5 yuan in silver dollars from Kaiming Middle School, 30 yuan in silver dollars and 187 jiao in small coins from Huaixing Elementary School, 18 yuan in silver dollars and 562 jiao in small coins from the Municipal Chongzheng Elementary School, 3 yuan in silver dollars and 41 jiao in small coins from Xintang Elementary School, 68 yuan and 8 fen in silver dollars from the Poor Children's Education Institute Elementary and Middle School, and 10 yuan in silver dollars and 192 jiao in small coins from Songxue Elementary School.

<p>The previous street collection by the Boy Scouts was quite successful, but due to the short time of only one day, it was difficult to be universal. Many residents in the city who are enthusiastic about emergency relief have requested the Emergency Relief General Donation Association to find a solution because of the difficulty in submitting general donations. The association has formulated convenient measures to enable all residents in the city to do their best for emergency relief to save the disaster victims. It is reported that general household donations began yesterday, and designated staff members such as Xue Baolun were sent to collect donations from door to door, with excellent results. It is hoped that all residents in the city will embrace the heart of "saving disaster victims is saving people, saving people is saving oneself," enthusiastically donate, and together achieve good deeds. The deductions from factory workers' donations sent to Shanghai Bank have been very enthusiastic in recent days. Yesterday, 5 yuan in silver dollars was opened by Huachang Weaving Factory, 10 yuan in silver dollars was opened by all employees of Huachang Weaving Factory, 17 yuan in silver dollars was opened by Hexing Copper Bed Factory, 12.7 yuan in silver dollars was opened by Dongxin Sand Casting Machine Factory, and 65.96 yuan in silver dollars was opened by Huachang Match Hard Sheet Company. It is also reported that many trade associations have been sending donations to the Emergency Relief Association in recent days. Yesterday, the Woolen Goods Trade Association sent 50 yuan in silver dollars, and other trade associations are in the process of soliciting donations. It is expected that the results will be considerable in the future.</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief General Donation Association has been discussing with leaders from all walks of life regarding donations from the wealthy and has determined the grade standards for the amount of donations from the wealthy. It is reported that solicitation will begin on the 22nd.</p>

<p>Central News Agency: President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, entered Beijing last week to attend the Fifth Plenary Session.

<h3>Municipal and County Jointly Owned Assets</h3>
<p>Evaluation Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The joint accumulation of grains, funds, and existing properties of Shanghai City and County have been repeatedly analyzed at meetings by representatives of both parties, but without results for a long time. The Municipal Finance Bureau has submitted an order to the Municipal Government for approval to survey, estimate, and divide the accumulation of grains, funds, and existing properties together. Representatives of both the city and county held an evaluation committee for jointly owned assets of the city and county at the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday. As a result, seven representatives were appointed to re-evaluate. The county representatives submitted the principles determined by the county government affairs meeting as a reference for the evaluation meeting, with the following principles: (1) The county still insists on surveying and estimating the two types of assets together, and after estimating the price, dividing the property and management according to the proportions that the city and county should receive. (2) After valuing the industrial land, it should be evenly distributed in advance with fertile and barren land matching each other. For those odd lots whose prices cannot match the city's six and the county's three, the two parties can make up the difference with cash. If the city still insists on auctioning off the property and dividing the funds, the county should request the right to inherit the assessed bid price and give priority to specifying the property as the winning bid. (3) Since the Shanghai Hospital is retained by the city, it should be uniformly valued and included in the city's share. (4) Existing assets and accumulated grain funds should be handled in the same way. After division, if the property obtained by the county has already been occupied by the city, it should be immediately transferred for acceptance. If it is needed in fact and cannot be transferred for a while, the rent should be paid according to the market value.</p>

<h3>The Peiping-Hankow and Nanking-Wuhu Railways</h3>
<p>Water-Land Intermodal Transport to Be Implemented on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Contracts Signed Sequentially</p>
<p>Great Convenience for Passengers</p>
<p>The Peiping-Hankow Railway's water-land intermodal transport faced difficulties in the construction of the Pu'an barges at the Jiang'an in Hankow. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially dispatched a commissioner to Hankow to excavate the Jiangbian Road, using giant iron chains to pass through the road and build cement and steel pilings to secure the barge. This matter has been settled. Now, the company has agreed with the Peiping-Hankow Railway to implement the intermodal transport on January 1st. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Implementation on New Year's Day: The Peiping-Hankow Railway's water-land intermodal transport contract was signed in March of this year. At that time, due to the issue of freight rates, the prices of foreign merchant ships on the Yangtze River route fell sharply, especially for intermodal cargo such as Xuchang tobacco. The railway and shipping companies repeatedly discussed this matter and revised the contract. Furthermore, the construction of the barge at Jiang'an in Hankow faced difficulties, leading to repeated postponements of the implementation date. It was not until the 20th of this month that the Pu'an barge was finally completed, allowing for the loading and unloading of goods. The company and the railway bureau then discussed and decided to implement the intermodal transport starting on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Civil Aviation: Private shipping companies in Shanghai can also participate in this intermodal transport. On the Yangtze River route, there are the Sanbei, Ningbo-Shaoxing, and other private shipping companies. Various private aviation companies have requested the organization of a joint office, to be composed of personnel appointed by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Sanbei, etc. This was previously submitted to the Ministry of Communications, and approval has now been received that it is not necessary to establish a separate office. When the intermodal transport volume on the Peiping-Hankow Railway is not yet crowded, the China Merchants, Sanbei, and Ningbo-Shaoxing shipping companies will use their existing Yangtze River ships to handle the intermodal cargo. However, the warehouse in Shanghai will be designated separately, and the accounts, etc., will be established separately by the company's intermodal transport division to be distributed to the private aviation companies. In the future, when the intermodal transport volume becomes crowded, special ships will be dispatched to transport directly to various ports in Nanhua. The Nanking-Wuhu Intermodal Transport: The Jiangnan Railway Company has currently constructed a railway from Wuhu to Sunjiabu in Xuancheng, totaling over 180 kilometers. Xuancheng is the wealthiest grain-producing area in Anhui Province, producing rice, wheat, rapeseed, and Xuancheng paper. More than two million dan are transported to Shanghai and Zhejiang each year. Historically, transportation has been done by sailboats due to inconvenient transportation. Now that the Xuancheng-Wuhu section of the Jiangnan Railway has been completed, grain from Sunjiabu can be transported by train. Mr. Zhou, the transportation director of the railway, has agreed with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on an intermodal transport contract. The details of the intermodal transport for the Wuhu-Xuancheng section have been signed.</p>
<p>Simultaneous Trial Operation: To operate the intermodal transport first on the Wuhu-Xuancheng section, the construction of the Nanking-Wuhu section will take another four months to complete. The company has dispatched Mr. Jin Jin, an officer from the intermodal transport division, to Wuhu to investigate the cargo transport on the Wuhu-Xuancheng section and negotiate the intermodal transport procedures. According to Mr. Jin's investigation, the main inbound cargo is grain, and the main outbound cargo is tobacco, kerosene, wheat flour, salt, sugar, hardware, seafood, and yarn. They have traditionally been transported by private boats. Now that Mr. Jin, representing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has reached an agreement with the Jiangnan Railway, it is planned to start the trial operation of the Wuhu-Xuancheng intermodal transport on New Year's Day, simultaneously with the Peiping-Hankow Railway. After the completion of the Nanking-Wuhu section, it will be added to the intermodal transport. The Wuhu-Xuancheng intermodal transport will not conflict with the business of the Yangtze River ships. It will replace the transportation by private sailboats with train-boat intermodal transport. The water freight will be cheaper, and the time will be faster. Passengers can also handle remittances, and the convenience is not limited to these few points.</p>

<p>Re-electing a Portion of the Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation recently held a board meeting and a shareholders' meeting, approving the company's financial statements for the 22nd year and many other important matters.

According to him, the relocation of the airport has been completed, and passengers have been boarding and disembarking at the new site since Sunday of last week. The meeting the day before yesterday was to present a report on the process. The following is a record of Mr. Li's remarks:</p>
<p>Airport Relocation: According to Mr. Li, the company's airport relocation has been underway for a long time. The site is located on the west bank of the Huangpu River, adjacent to the north of the China National Aviation Corporation's airport. It covers an area of 800 square meters, and the acquisition of private land has been completed. Temporary office buildings and hangars have been built. Since Sunday of last week (the 16th), passengers have begun to board and disembark at that location. Yesterday's board meeting was to present a report on the relocation process and to submit the budget for the construction of the hangars for discussion and resolution. Replacing with Large Aircraft: The company currently has three W34 aircraft and three W33 aircraft. The former has a larger fuselage and more passenger seats, while the latter is smaller. This was also discussed at the meeting the other day. Because the company's routes are very long and there are more passengers, it was decided to exchange the original three smaller W33 aircraft with the German Lufthansa Airlines for two W34 aircraft. Once the new aircraft are shipped to China, the old aircraft will be shipped back.</p>
<p>Approval of Financial Statements: At the shareholders' meeting, in addition to the company submitting the financial statements for the 22nd year, which were discussed and approved by the meeting, the Chinese director Shen Yani submitted a resignation request, which was approved. Du Dianying was re-elected to succeed him. Furthermore, the term of office for the company's supervisor Cheng Yuanfan has expired, and Wang Yansong has been appointed to replace him.</p>

<h3>Exchange Federation Pushes for Representative Petition</h3>
<p>Gu Xin Yi and Mu Ouchu Go to Beijing</p>
<p>Departed Last Night</p>
<p>The Exchange Federation, in order to request the Central Government to temporarily postpone the collection of transaction tax, again appointed Gu Xin Yi and Mu Ouchu as representatives of the Exchange Federation, and carrying a petition, they took the night express train to Beijing at 11:00 PM last night to meet with the Central Authorities and request a temporary postponement of implementation. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Three Major Functions of the Exchange   In the modern economic organization, the exchange has three major functions: forming prices, transferring risks, and circulating materials. The exchange is the center of the continuing market, gathering a large amount of supply and demand, seeking mutual convergence, and determining appropriate prices as the official market price.</p>
<p>1.  Forming Buying and Selling Prices   This official market price can directly serve as a standard for the buying and selling prices of those involved in material transactions, and indirectly as a guide to the changing trends in the economic sphere. However, the rise and fall of the official market price of the exchange can indicate the actual supply and demand of the goods and the accurate credit of the securities. Producers, guided by this market price, can prepare in advance. If there is a trend of supply exceeding demand, they reduce their production. If there is a trend of demand exceeding supply, they increase their production, so that the supply of materials does not suffer from the disadvantage of excess or deficiency, and then they can safely implement "market production". The exchange, guided by this market price, can know the underlying meaning of supply and demand and make fair transactions. Investors, guided by this market price, can know what to do, choose the short and avoid the long, and make profitable investments. Not only that, but the exchange also has futures trading, so that if there are differences in supply and demand between locations A and B, and between near and far times, the market price will be different. Then, purchase where supply is abundant and sell where demand is high, playing the role of shortening the long and supplementing the short, and achieving the effect of drawing from one to add to the other. The supply and demand of different times and places can be adjusted, and the prices of different times and places can also be leveled. This is why the exchange is a price-forming mechanism in modern economic organization, and why Article 19 of our Exchange Law stipulates that "the exchange shall determine, announce, and publicize market prices."</p>
<p>2.  Risk Transfer Mechanism   In the modern economic organization, in addition to laborers and capitalists, there is also the existence of the business sector. Entrepreneurs are those who operate businesses with their own plans, and at the same time, they also bear the risks of business operation. Therefore, if an enterprise wants to develop, it must find ways to minimize the risks it faces. The modern exchange operates with a large amount of supply and demand, regular trading methods, and the reference of speculative traders. Therefore, the future crises caused by production by entrepreneurs can be transferred to speculators through hedging (hedging trading). Generally, there is a time difference between the purchase of raw materials and the production of products in all production industries, and there will be changes in supply and demand and fluctuations in market prices during this time difference. However, knowing that the prices of raw materials and the prices of products tend to rise and fall in unison, it is possible to pre-sell raw materials and products of the same month in the exchange at the same time as purchasing raw materials. In this way, if the market price rises later, the losses in the exchange can be compensated by the raw material purchase. If the market price falls in the future, the losses in the raw material purchase can be compensated by the exchange. As a result of hedging, the risks faced by entrepreneurs in production can be borne by speculators in the exchange, and producers can safely engage in production. This is why the exchange is a risk transfer mechanism in modern economic organization.</p>
<p>3.  Material Circulation Mechanism   Today's market production is mostly the accumulation of shares, so the buying and selling of a product and the raising of a company's shares must have a central agency to gather its supply and demand. Otherwise, buyers and sellers are scattered in all directions, and funds do not flow regularly. Convergence is not easy, and transactions are even more difficult. Those with huge capital do not know where to purchase and do not know where to invest. Even if there is the mediation of intermediaries, the negotiation of prices, the identification of quality and credit, and the performance of contract terms are not necessarily reliable. With the establishment of the exchange, a large amount of supply and demand is concentrated, the system of guaranteeing buying and selling is established, and transactions can be completed at any time and in any quantity. Prices are fair, grades are clear, credit is evident, and procedures are extremely simple, facilitating transactions, smoothing the transfer of materials and the circulation of capital. This is why the exchange is a material circulation mechanism in modern economic organization. The exchange has such economic functions in modern society, and it is even more impossible to ignore it under the current situation in our country. Today, a large number of products in our country, such as cotton, yarn, and grain, are squeezed by foreigners, and the shortening of sales channels is not uncommon. If each industry has an exchange organization, the masters of the industry will manage the affairs of the industry, the news will be well-informed, opportunities will not be missed, the planning will be meticulous, and the market conditions can be maintained. With real power in the hands of each industry, it will not be manipulated by foreigners. This is another function of the exchange under the current situation in China. Therefore, for the sake of economic development, for the sake of rescuing the depression, and for the sake of competing with foreigners, it is necessary to support its growing trend at present.</p>
<p>The Disadvantages of Taxing the Exchange   The establishment of formal exchanges in our country originated after the seventh year of the Republic of China. After the turmoil of the tenth year of the Republic of China, the foundation gradually became stable. Over the past ten years, they have been painstakingly managed, and have created today's situation, and have fulfilled their due responsibilities. Now, our government levies transaction tax on exchanges. In terms of academic theory, this is a matter of course. How dare merchants hold different views on this? However, in fact, under the current situation in our country, the problem of implementing the collection of transaction tax is not whether the tax law is intended or not, but the concern is how the associated disadvantages will be. Once the exchange is taxed, brokers, for their own benefit, will inevitably take the following two paths. First, brokers, for the sake of current interests, pass on the burden to clients and increase the handling fees for buying and selling. Second, brokers, for the sake of future interests, endure the burden for a while, maintain the original handling fee rate, in order to attract buying and selling orders. Of these two, one must be chosen. Now, first, from the result of brokers increasing the handling fees for buying and selling, we can deduce the consequences that should be dealt with.</p>
<p>After the Handling Fee for Buying and Selling is Increased   After the handling fee for buying and selling is increased, the direct result will inevitably affect the decline in buying and selling. In today's commercial depression and market decline, this decline in buying and selling is an inevitable fact. The exchange will also inevitably be led to a state of stagnation. The function of the exchange has been described above. Its role in the modern economic organization is like the heart of the human body. The blood vessels of the whole body enter the heart, and then circulate throughout the body, developing into strength. Now, if the heart reduces its effectiveness, the whole body will suffer. The disadvantages of exchange stagnation are the same as this, and the depressed commercial situation will become more depressed, and the stagnant materials will become more stagnant. This is one thing that cannot be ignored. Today, the largest transaction in our securities market is government bonds. In recent years, due to financial deficits, the treasury's allocation relies heavily on bond issuance. If transaction tax is also levied on the buying and selling of government bonds, the result in the future will inevitably lead to the stagnation of old bonds and the difficulty of issuing new bonds. This is the second thing that cannot be ignored. Moreover, during the national crisis, everything is waiting to be done. In recent years, various provinces have been working hard on construction, and the materials for construction rely on the issuance of debt bonds to serve as funds. The best way to raise this kind of public debt is to hold it in the securities market. In terms of the future trend of local bonds in various provinces, there will inevitably be an opening day in the near future. Now, if the exchange's buying and selling expenses increase, buying and selling will not be easy, indirectly blocking the road to provincial bond issuance. This is the third thing that cannot be ignored. Our country's securities market has always had few stocks on the market. In the past year or two, although one or two dozen types have started trading in Shanghai, the number is still limited. Although China's enterprises have not been developed due to various internal reasons, China's economy is ultimately booming, and the development of enterprises is expected. Now, if there is one more obstacle to buying and selling on the exchange, there will be one more difficulty in the transfer of stocks. Therefore, it is difficult for established enterprises to develop, and it is difficult for unfinished enterprises to be produced. This is the fourth thing that cannot be ignored. Our country's national industrial industry flourished during the height of the European War. The most notable among them are cotton yarn and flour. The products of both of these are indispensable to our people's livelihood. However, after the world economic panic occurred, the surplus products of various countries flooded in, and the neighboring country of Japan was particularly strong. Products such as yarn and cloth flour were all competing with our national products at the lowest price. Those with weak capital have collapsed one after another, and those with slightly thicker capital have also entered the last breath. Now, if the commodity exchange that circulates materials is increased by one more obstacle, then the factories in this last breath may also be reduced without ending the morning, and give a great blow to the national industrial industry. This is the fifth thing that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Broker's Handling Fee   The result of brokers increasing the handling fee for buying and selling is as described above. Now, from the perspective of brokers maintaining the current handling fee, we can deduce the points that can be worried about. In fact, today, the handling fees charged by brokers to clients in various exchanges are often lower than the fixed amount due to the depressed market conditions. Now, if there is another layer of transaction tax burden, the most worrying thing is that it may lead to illegal "external transfer" transactions within the exchange. External transfer transactions are buying and selling that is conducted privately at the exchange market price without going through the exchange market. There are two types of external transfer: one is external transfer from Broker A to Broker B, and the other is external transfer from Client A and Client B at the same broker. External transfer is an illegal act and is strictly prohibited by the Exchange Law (Article 38). However, where the profit lies, and because the losses increase, it is difficult to avoid breaking the law. As a result of external transfer, not only does buying and selling lose the protection of the exchange, but also since buying and selling does not go through the exchange, the exchange has no way to know the broker's trading volume. Therefore, on the one hand, transactions can be leaked, and on the other hand, if there are too many external transfers, the exchange's commission income will be reduced, and profits will be reduced. Therefore, the business tax originally paid by the exchange based on profits will also be greatly reduced, and harm the national treasury's income. At this point, if the government gains from this (transaction tax) and loses from that (business tax), is it not still useless to finance? This is the first thing that cannot be ignored. Taking a step back, even if brokers endure losses, they may be able to barely sustain them temporarily at present. However, after a long time, the accumulated losses will inevitably affect the survival of the exchange. Unfortunately, if the Japanese "exchange" which is not subject to our laws rises up, deliberately disrupting the situation, then our country's exchanges will inevitably have to shut down all operations. If it comes to this point, then the prices of our country's products will inevitably have to listen to foreigners again. The exchange that has been fought for for more than ten years will be handed over to others again. Is there anything in the world that is more heartbreaking than this? This is another thing that cannot be ignored. In summary, although the collection of transaction tax is theoretically indisputable, there may be many difficulties in implementation. It is necessary to carefully study the tax rate so that the aforementioned disadvantages can be reduced to the minimum. Otherwise, the effectiveness of the tax collection has not been seen, and the economic crisis will occur immediately. This is not the original intention of our government's tax collection. Therefore, rather than failing in the end, it is better to be cautious at the beginning. Merchants are not intelligent and only state what they see as an aid to the government's administration, and dare not deliberately create alarming words to sensationalize.</p>

<h3>Henan Fellow Villagers Welcome Liu Zhi</h3>
<p>New Asia Restaurant at 5 PM Tonight</p>
<p>Please Order Each County to Eliminate Poisonous Bandits</p>
<p>Liu Zhi, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, went to Beijing from Henan a few days ago to attend the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and then came to Shanghai, residing at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road.

<h3>Report on the Red Swastika Society's Investigation and Distribution of Emergency Relief in Liyang</h3>
<p>The Gospel of the Disaster Victims in Julidan Three Counties</p>
<p>The drought in Liyang County is severe. The Red Swastika Society previously appointed President Li Tianyi to investigate and distribute relief. It is now heard that it has been completed. The Society received a letter from Commissioner Li from Liyang yesterday, reporting the distribution of relief in great detail. The extracts are as follows (the above is omitted). After the review was completed, 37,000 bags of relief flour were purchased and transported. A joint meeting was held with the heads of the China Foreign Famine Relief Commission, the Shanghai Zhiyuan Buddhist Society, the Wuxi Swastika Society, the Pu Ren Charity Association, and other relief workers. The reviewed household registrations were re-examined, balanced and distributed, and it was decided that each Swastika ticket would be distributed with 50 jin, Pu ticket 30 jin, and Hui ticket 20 jin, in order to show fairness. It was also stipulated that the first district would be released from the 8th to the 11th for three days, the second district on the 12th, and the third district would continue to be released on the 16th, releasing for three days in each district. On the day of the relief distribution, Tianzhen invited representatives from all walks of life in the party and government to monitor the distribution. As a result, 2,172 households received Swastika tickets, 3,775 households received Pu tickets, 1,922 households received Hui tickets, and 600 households were added in the first district. In the second district, 2,308 households received Swastika tickets, 3,163 households received Pu tickets, and 1,822 households received Hui tickets. In the third district, 1,937 households received Swastika tickets, 68 households received Pu tickets, and 3,996 households received Hui tickets. In the fourth district, 2,056 households received Swastika tickets, 2,653 households received Pu tickets, and 1,228 households received Liao tickets. In the fifth district, 2,981 households received Swastika tickets, 5,010 households received Pu tickets, and 2,315 households received Hui tickets. In the sixth district, 87 households received Swastika tickets, 936 households received Pu tickets, and 2,554 households received Hui tickets. In addition, 120 households were added to the Swastika. In total, 11,541 households received Swastika tickets, 15,605 households received Pu tickets, 13,837 households received Hui tickets, and 720 households received Swastika tickets, for a total of 37,650 bags of flour. This relief effort achieved such good results, entirely due to the joint efforts of the various charitable organizations. Those who promoted and supported this matter were mainly Li Dixian, He Zhongxiao, Lu Bohong, Cai Quchen, and Tang Huikang. Cai Quchen, in particular, was busy in Shanghai and Xixing, arranging fundraising, which is especially commendable. As for the relief efforts in Lishui, Jurong, and Danyang counties, they were also promoted by Lu Bohong, and a meeting was held in Wuxi, which will still be jointly assisted by the Society. Once the relief work in Li is completed, it can be started soon, etc.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Society Handles Work Relief in Nanjin's Southern Townships</h3>
<p>After the great flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Chinese Jisheng Society handled the water disaster dike work in the southern townships of Nanjing, and it cost more than 40,000 yuan. After the project was completed, water disasters could be avoided. Unexpectedly, there was another severe drought this year. The rivers and canals near Zhangtang and Guocun were severely silted up in sections and could not be irrigated. This is very important for agricultural production and people's livelihood. The Society has now publicly appointed members Li Wende, Fu Wende, and Fu Chunsheng to be responsible for repairing the river works and to bring hundreds of sets of cotton clothes as relief supplies. Relief funds will be remitted successively from the Guohua Bank in this port. The completion of the entire river requires a great deal of money. It is hoped that patriotic people and enthusiastic compatriots will join together to help, and cannot help but look forward to it.</p>

<h3>This Year's Cotton Production Greatly Increased</h3>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Textile Mills Using Over 500,000 Bales</p>
<p>According to reliable statistics, this year's cotton production in our country has reached over 1.1 million bales, an increase of over 10% compared to last year. As a result, domestic cotton occupies an important position in the domestic market, while imported cotton from the United States and India is greatly squeezed out. The quantity of domestic cotton sold has also increased compared to previous years. Taking Shanghai alone, most of the raw cotton used by Chinese and Japanese textile mills is domestically produced, and the sales of imported cotton from the United States and India are not as good as before. The various figures are listed below for comparison.</p>
<p>Quantity of Raw Cotton Purchased by Chinese and Japanese Textile Mills in Shanghai</p>
<p>Type                 1933                 1934</p>
<p>Chinese Cotton       443,727              513,826</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton 12,230              17,876</p>
<p>Shandong Cotton      17,508              13,346</p>
<p>American Cotton        117,827              47,600</p>
<p>Indian Cotton        125,850              63,026</p>
<p>Egyptian Cotton      10,250              5,900</p>
<p>Total                697,652              630,354</p>
<p>Judging from the above table, although the total amount of cotton purchased by various Chinese and Japanese textile mills in Shanghai this year (excluding the second half of December) is slightly lower than last year, domestic cotton accounts for the highest percentage of raw cotton from all countries. Out of the total demand of 630,000 bales, Chinese cotton accounts for over 513,000 bales, or over 75%. The output from the United States, India, Egypt, and others has been greatly reduced. American cotton has plummeted by 60% compared to last year, Indian cotton has decreased by about half, and Egypt is similar to India. Domestic cotton has made such progress this year, and if it can continue, all foreign cotton will undoubtedly abandon its position in China.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Federation of Chinese Factories</h3>
<p>Site of the Shanghai South National Exhibition</p>
<p>Yesterday Also Issued a Notice to Factories Clarifying Rumors</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: The Shanghai South National Goods Exhibition organized by the Federation of Chinese National Goods Manufacturers on Yongji Lane, Xizang Road, has been actively underway since its inception, sparing no effort. As the opening is scheduled for New Year's Day next year, and time is pressing, the association first measured the area of the exhibition site yesterday to plan the construction of the stands. Yesterday, a notice was issued to member manufacturers clarifying that the Shanghai South National Goods Exhibition is not jointly organized with the China National Goods Association. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Site Plan According to Liu Zhongying, a member of the standing committee of the association, the exhibition site has been rented on vacant land at the entrance of Hengxing Lane, 16 Pu, measuring approximately 250 square zhang. It is planned to build 120 bamboo sheds, each estimated to be one square zhang in depth and width. The main entrance of the exhibition site will be located on both the inner and outer roads. Four pedestrian walkways, each twelve feet wide, will be opened in the center of the site, and the perimeter will be connected to allow passage to the inner and outer roads. One pedestrian walkway at the main entrance and in the center of the site will be sixteen feet wide, allowing visitors to tour the site without getting confused. Inside the exhibition site, there will be an exhibition area where the products of various factories will be displayed in wooden-framed glass display cases. A lecture stage will be set up in the center of the exhibition area, and experts will be hired to give lectures on the theory of national goods every day. The office will be located in the northern part of the exhibition area, and the fire brigade and public team will be located at the main entrance in the north. Fire extinguishers will be widely hung throughout the site by the association's member factory, China Industrial Society, to supplement the fire brigade's efforts and ensure complete safety. As for the various projects, the site was measured and drawn yesterday, and an application has been submitted to the Public Works Bureau for a license. Construction of the site will begin immediately.</p>
<p>Notice of Clarification: Notice is hereby given that the association's Shanghai South National Goods Exhibition has been filed with the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau in accordance with the law, and preparations have been actively underway. However, yesterday, Fengchang Hosiery Factory and others came to the association, stating that the China National Goods Association had already collected booth fees from the factory and others. Hearing that the association was in the process of organizing the (Shanghai South National Goods Exhibition), they came to the association to inquire about the truth. In this regard, the association has never jointly organized any national goods exhibitions with any organization, except for those held in other provinces that were assisted by local authorities. The current national goods exhibition in Shanghai South is entirely organized and managed by the association alone. The claim of joint organization with the China National Goods Association is a rumor spread by someone with other motives. In addition to clarifying the matter to Fengchang Hosiery Factory and others, the association is concerned that members may be unaware of the truth and be deceived. Therefore, this notice is solemnly issued for your information.</p>
<h3>Taifeng Company Closes Down</h3>
<p>Affected by Huaming Match Factory</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Taifeng Canned Food Co., Ltd., has been operating in Shanghai for 29 years. In addition to the Nanjing Road main store and wholesale department, it has its own factory at 1501 Xiaoshadu Lane for manufacturing. The company has now been affected by Huaming Xingji Match Company and has hired accountant Xu Yongzuo and lawyer Zhang Zhengxue to declare bankruptcy. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Taifeng's History All matters of Taifeng Company are the responsibility of directors Deng Ruiren, Huang Chuzhen, Tang Yinghua, Tang Yaojian, and Li Chongkun. The general manager is Wang Baru and the deputy manager is Fei Chuzhen. The factory manager is Deng Ruiren. The initial capital at the time of establishment was only 100,000 yuan. Later, due to business development, the capital was increased twice by 100,000 yuan, and now the total capital is 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Business Situation The company's main store is located at 255 Nanjing Road and has more than 90 employees. The wholesale department is attached to the main store. The Xiaoshadu Road factory is located on the banks of the Suzhou River and has more than 130 workers. Together with the senior office staff in the factory, there are approximately 240 to 250 people. The factory is divided into four departments: machine biscuits, meat, white iron. Manufacturing has been suspended since yesterday. A notice jointly signed by the accountant and lawyer is posted in front of the factory gate. Most of the workers are from Guangdong and have been working in the factory for more than ten years, with some reaching more than twenty years.</p>
<p>Reasons for Liquidation According to the staff of the main store, Taifeng has had profits every year. This closure is sudden and is entirely due to being affected by the Huaming Match Company. As for Huaming, it was established on Jiangwan Sports Club Road with an initial capital of 30,000 yuan. Due to losses, it was increased to 50,000 yuan. As business continued to be poor, the capital was further increased to 80,000 yuan. After several reorganizations, the total capital is now more than 100,000 yuan. The biggest reason for the failure of manager Su Yupeng and deputy manager Cai Keming is that Huaming was recently involved in a lawsuit over stamp tax issues, which cost a lot. The failure of Huaming's business led to Taifeng's inability to circulate funds and a sudden closure.</p>
<p>Consultations on the Aftermath The board of directors convened a meeting yesterday. All of Huaming's assets are now in the custody of Taifeng. The total amount owed to Taifeng is more than 400,000 yuan. If Huaming can be sold immediately to repay Taifeng, Taifeng can still reopen. However, liquidation is currently underway, and it is not easy to sell. Even if Taifeng wants to regroup, it will take time. (All notices from accountants and lawyers have appeared in advertisements and will not be recorded separately).</p>
<h3>Pretending to Be an Uncle to Obtain Inheritance</h3>
<p>Nephew and Uncle Had No Contact During Their Lives</p>
<p>No Evidence of Property in Court</p>
<p>The Nanshi District Court tried a case of inheritance claim a few days ago, the circumstances of which were quite interesting. The testimony is recorded below. A woman from Tongzhou, Chen Cao, 60 years old, currently residing in Caoxie Bay, Nanshi, runs a rickshaw house and owns 17 rickshaws, which bring in a decent income. Recently, Jiang Shengfa, through lawyer Gu Zukuan, filed a lawsuit with the district court to claim the inheritance of his uncle Jiang Jianqun, stating that his uncle had been living with Chen Cao for 16 years and opened a rickshaw company with 40 rickshaws. He also owned 30 to 40 mu of land in his hometown. His uncle recently died of illness, and his inheritance should be inherited by the petitioner. A few days ago, Jiang Shengfa was summoned to testify about the previous situation. Chen Cao testified that her late husband, Chen Meiming, had worked hard and frugally to open a rickshaw house and purchase 17 rickshaws, which he rented out for a living for more than 30 years. Ten years ago, he hired Jiang Jianqun as a partner to repair vehicles. Because Jiang was old and had been ill for several years, she treated him out of consideration for his years of partnership and because he was alone. He was treated by doctors but to no avail and died in September. The cost of his clothing and coffin was not insignificant. Unexpectedly, Jiang Shengfa suddenly appeared, falsely claiming to be the dead man's uncle, in an attempt to obtain the inheritance. This is ridiculous and should be rejected. The judge asked Jiang Shengfa, "What qualifications do you have to claim the inheritance?" Jiang replied, "My uncle had no heirs, so all the inheritance should be inherited by me." The judge said, "Chen Cao claims that it is the property of her husband. Do you have any proof?" Jiang answered, "No." Chen Cao said, "If he is Jiang Jianqun's nephew, why did he never visit him when he was alive? This shows that he is falsely claiming the relationship." The judge, after learning the situation, considered it unreasonable and reprimanded Jiang Shengfa in court, ordering him to leave. It is truly a curious tale.</p>
<h3>Laborer Ma Rushan Chops Off Foreman's Left Arm</h3>
<p>Dismissal Suspected to Be Masterminded</p>
<p>Principal Offender Arrested and Taken to the Bureau</p>
<p>Dong Zhan'ao, a 47-year-old Hebei native residing in No. 40, Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, worked as a foreman in the sawmill on the north bank of the town. He was honest and amiable. However, Ma Rushan, a 22-year-old Hebei native and laborer in the factory, was dismissed a few days ago for beating people without reason in the factory. Ma falsely accused Dong of masterminding the dismissal and harbored deep resentment.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 9:00 AM, Ma gathered several accomplices and waited outside the factory, surrounding Dong to argue. They disagreed, and Ma led the crowd to attack, pulling out a sharp axe and chopping Dong several times. Dong was injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. His left arm was chopped off, and his back was also chopped once. He fainted from the pain. Officer Wei of the police station at that location heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. The police arrested the assailant Ma Rushan, while the others fled. The injured man was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Ma Rushan and the axe were taken to the Caojiadu Branch Bureau. After questioning by Officer Liu, he was ordered to be taken to the bureau for further questioning.</p>

<p>Suspect Comes Face to Face</p>
<p>Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>He Shifa, a 36-year-old Nanjing native, works as a butler in the home of a Russian at No. 10, Lane 327, Fuli Road, French Concession. He lives with his wife, Geng, a 36-year-old Nanjing native, at No. 137, Julai Road. He is fond of women and recently became involved with Liu Yang, the wife of Liu Baoyou (29 years old), a Xuzhou native who works in a Western store at No. 29, Maggie Road. When Liu is away from home, He goes to Liu's house to meet with Yang. At 1:30 AM the night before last, He finished his business and went to Liu's house to meet with Yang again. Liu Baoyou returned home unexpectedly and caught them in the act. Overwhelmed with jealousy, Liu grabbed He and beat him, stabbing He's head several times with a small knife and striking He's head with a small iron hammer, causing He to collapse unconscious. Liu then said to his wife, "Quickly hire a car to send him to the hospital for treatment. I'll go report to the police." He then escaped. Liu Yang followed her husband's instructions and sent He to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. The hospital learned about He's injuries and reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Yang. He Shifa died at 10:20 PM that night due to severe head injuries. The hospital notified the police, who sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Funeral Home for an autopsy. They also went to Liu's home and took an iron hammer used in the attack. The murder weapon has not been found. Yesterday, He Geng, the wife of the deceased, and Zhang Hailong, the landlord of Liu Baoyou, were summoned to the police station. The case was reported to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren and forensic doctors Wei and Jiang, along with clerk Peng, arrived at the funeral home at noon to confirm that the deceased died from head injuries caused by an iron weapon. After questioning the deceased's wife and witnesses, they ordered the body to be handed over to the deceased's wife for burial, pending the police department's investigation and arrest of the suspect.

While walking along the intersection of Haige Road and Shanzhong Road, they encountered the suspect Liu Baoyou coming towards them. The detectives arrested him and took him to the police station to await interrogation by the court.</p>
<h3>Continental Ship Destroys Sailboat</h3>
<p>Waiting for Shipowner to Telegraph the Truth</p>
<p>The Continental Ship of Continental Industries Co., Ltd. at 20 Sijing Road, left Shanghai on the 18th, first arriving at Shantou to unload cargo, and then proceeding to Bangkok, Siam, to transport rice.

Last night, according to the company, the captain's report had not arrived, but a letter had been sent to the Insurance Federation. After the shipowner's telegram arrives, a copy will be sent.

<h3>Yong'an Silver Company Actively Preparing to Resume Business</h3>
<p>Currently Auditing Accounts</p>
<p>Since the Yong'an Silver Company temporarily suspended operations, there have been various rumors regarding the resumption of business. The reason for the company's suspension of operations was solely due to Ou Jiancheng's absconding with funds and unilaterally ordering the suspension of operations. Ou Jiancheng had centralized control over all departments of the company. At the beginning of his escape, he ordered the suspension of operations without the resolution of the board of directors, creating a chaotic situation and leaving the accounts of various departments in disarray. According to the person in charge of the board of directors, the entire board is now working together to actively prepare for the resumption of business. Accountant Jiang is working day and night to expedite the audit. Once the audit is completed, the company will resume operations as soon as possible.</p>

The witness Shen Genxi testified that Ms. Li had come to demand 3,000 wen in wages because she had overdrawn too much. He refused to pay, leading to an argument. The manager told them to go outside to talk. Ms. Li tripped and fell on the threshold, injuring herself, but the manager did not strike her. Judge Sun Peng, after reviewing the evidence, stated that the victim's injuries had been certified by a forensic doctor, and there was no room for denial. Therefore, the court sentenced Fang Zhongda to a fine of thirty yuan for assault.</p>

<h3>Abduction of a Young Girl Held Pending Judgment</h3>
<p>A fifteen-year-old girl named A Bao, from Taizhou and residing at No. 6 Pingliang Road, was a worker at the Shanghai Cotton Mill on Guangxin Road. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month at around 6:00 PM, Zhao Songchen (also known as Xiao Chen), a twenty-two-year-old fellow villager, lured her to the rooftop of the New World Company to play and watch a performance. Later, he tricked her into staying overnight at the home of a friend surnamed Jin in Caojiadu, Huajie. After his daughter went missing, her father, Sun Wensheng, searched for her without success. He reported the incident to the Yangshupu Police Station. Until the day before yesterday, Mr. Jin notified the police station. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Zhao. Upon questioning, it was discovered that he and the girl were living in the Concession. The Jing'an Temple Police Station was informed and sent Chinese and foreign detectives to bring them back to the police station, then transferred to Yangshupu Police Station. The girl was returned to Sun Wensheng. Yesterday morning, Zhao was handed over to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Mr. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, recounted the events. When questioned, the defendant stated that the girl did not want to go home and went with him to the home of his friend surnamed Jin in Caojiadu to stay temporarily. There was no improper conduct. Because Jin extorted him for ten yuan, he reported the incident to the police station. His other statements were evasive. The girl stated that she and Jin slept in the same bed at Jin's house, while he slept on another bed. Nothing else happened. Judge Wu Zehan ordered the defendant to be held pending sentencing on a later date.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Having carefully read the news column of your esteemed newspaper on the third page concerning local news, which reported that Dr. Wang Zhenchuan was detained by the Garrison Headquarters, and that the reason for his arrest was suspected to be related to the drug case uncovered in Zhabei, and is currently under investigation by the military court, we are greatly surprised to find that this does not correspond with the facts. Our director has always been cautious and self-respecting, and would never engage in rash or unconventional behavior. His dedication to voluntary smoking cessation demonstrates his abhorrence of drugs. However, someone who once stayed at the hospital for treatment and owed hospital fees suddenly implicated him in an old case, claiming he knew about it, which is why he was summoned for questioning, not arrested. Furthermore, the claim that he is connected to some drug organization is purely unfounded. We believe your newspaper's report was based on misinformation. Therefore, we are writing this letter to request a correction, to clarify the truth. We would be extremely grateful. With respect,</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 6: A Poor Girl Cannot Be Forced to Teach, Viewing a Western Teacher as No More Than a Humble Heart</p>
<p>Jia Duocai smiled and said, "Can you really call these little guys guests? If a foreigner wants to come, I'll immediately send them packing. But I'm curious to know what these two foreigners are really after."</p>
<p>Li Shilian said, "Westerners' customs are different from Chinese people's. They won't engage in meaningless pleasantries. If they want to come, they must have a purpose. I think they must be asking you about the situation in the Northwest, to gather information for some research."</p>
<p>Jia Duocai said, "I bet they see me as a scholar, interviewing me about the economic situation in the Northwest. These Europeans and Americans are truly formidable; they won't even let someone ordinary like me, a banker, off the hook. Alright, tell them to come in an hour. Let me sit in the room and think quietly about how to phrase things. I have a systematic study on the cotton production in Shaanxi, which I can present to him."</p>
<p>Li Shilian said, "Okay, I'll go reply. I think they're genuinely sincere in visiting you. They'll come even if they have to wait an hour."</p>
<p>Jia Duocai said seriously, "It doesn't matter whether they come or not; I need to consider things before I meet them. You must understand that this is a matter related to the nation's dignity. We must make sure we don't make any mistakes in our words."</p>
<p>Li Shilian thought that there must be a reason for the foreigners' special visit. With Jia Duocai's embellishment, he felt it was even more unusual, and repeatedly said, "Yes, yes."</p>
<p>Jia Duocai returned to the room and immediately waved his hands at the Hu sisters, saying, "You can leave now; I'm having some foreigners come over."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hu asked, "Are they devils?"</p>
<p>Jia Duocai waved his hand again and said, "Go, go. We can talk about anything later."</p>
<p>Yueying had been subjected to several tens of minutes of examination in this room, and she felt wronged enough. Since Master Jia was dismissing people like this, it could be considered a lifeline for her. Why would she still sit here? She stood up first and walked out the door, followed by Mrs. Hu. (95)</p>
<h3>Literary Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— by Shayu</p>
<p>Red Bean Thoughts For that "Red beans grow in the South, this thing best evokes longing" red bean poem, "red bean" has become an elegant object in literary circles. Throughout history, countless poems and lyrics have praised red beans, such as Tang Dynasty poet Wen Tingyun's "Exquisite dice inlaid with red beans, knowing whether the longing reaches the bone"? These are all borrowed, like Wang Wei's, to symbolize longing. Mr. Qian Muqi of the Qing Dynasty had a red bean tree in front of his study, so he named his study "Red Bean Villa." Mr. Qian was a great Confucian scholar of his time, so the red beans of Changshu became famous throughout the South and were highly regarded by contemporaries. In fact, Anhui, Guangdong, and other provinces all produce them. Even the West Dongting Mountain, which belongs to Suzhou, has two red bean trees. Among the types of red beans, those produced on Zhubu Mountain in Anhui are the most lovable. The beans are about the size of yellow soybeans, oval in shape, and bright red in color. The longer they are worn, the brighter they become. Mr. Hanyun once gave two of these red beans to the respected father of Yu Yifen. Although the red beans of Changshu are famous because of people, their shape is about the size of Go stones, not perfectly round, and their color varies from red to black. Mr. Yu Youqing, a colleague of Tongwen, collected and entrusted stores to sell a large quantity of Changshu red beans this year. This aroused opposition from several people who had been storing red beans, who believed that Mr. Yu was selling love-sick beans as merchandise, which was too demeaning to such an elegant object. According to Mr. Yu, his sale of red beans was originally to raise funds for compiling a "Red Bean Poetry Collection." However, this has already caused a small dispute in Suzhou newspapers.</p>
<p>Fragrant Grass and Beautiful Woman Writers are, after all, sentimental souls. Ever since Qu Lingjun, the grand master of the Chu kingdom, created the term "fragrant grass and beautiful woman" in his poem "Li Sao," a group of writers have entrusted their deep emotions to famous flowers and fragrant grasses. For example, Tao Jingjie's love of chrysanthemums and Zhou Dunyi's love of lotuses are well-known and admired by later generations. Among modern writers who love flowers, Mr. Hu Shiyu's love of plum blossoms, Mr. Cheng Zhanlu's love of winter plum blossoms, and our editor Mr. Zhou's love of violets can also be considered fine anecdotes in the literary world.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Hongxia)</p>
<p>According to statistics from the International Trade Bureau, in the past ten months, the total value of imported cosmetics and perfumes amounted to 1,451,788 national currency, an increase of 24,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. This number is truly alarming. If this huge sum is divided by ten months, the average daily expenditure would be 4,839.29 yuan. This sum of money is entirely consumed by women in bits and pieces of cosmetics and perfumes. Female compatriots, please do not belittle these small amounts of cosmetics and perfumes!</p>
<h3>Records of My Fragrant Past</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"If we find that your behavior has not improved by then, your second tail will have to be cut off!" The fox happily agreed, declaring that it was also aware of its faults and willing to try its best to reform. However, after returning, a thousand years quickly passed, and its behavior was still very bad. The only difference in the past thousand years was that it had never been drunk once; but its various bad habits continued to play out, and its misdeeds were obvious, no matter how cunning it was, it could not deny them. The Jade Emperor, of course, knew about this long ago, so he immediately grabbed it and cut off another tail. At the same time, hoping that it could reform, he gave it another thousand years, as before, to slowly turn over a new leaf. The fox also tearfully agreed. But after returning, it soon reverted to its old ways, indulging in wrongdoing. In the blink of an eye, the second millennium had passed, and the Jade Emperor carefully examined it. Apart from not having drunk alcohol and not having lied, it still had no good qualities. Its refusal to repent was, needless to say, very disappointing to the Jade Emperor, so he decided to continue to punish it. Fortunately, it still had seven tails! So, every thousand years, it was assessed once, and the result of each assessment was always unsatisfactory, so he cut off one tail each time. After eight thousand years, the fox had only one tail left, but its behavior was still not perfect. According to the Jade Emperor's intention, it could not keep this last tail either, so he grabbed it again, telling it that it could no longer be forgiven. This time, in order to remove the root of all evil, its last tail had to be cut off as well. Perhaps such a disposition would be able to transform it into a kind and docile fox. (205)</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Li Shicen</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zheng</p>
<p>Mr. Li's death is undoubtedly a great loss to the academic community. In China, where scholars are scarce, it is especially worthy of our grief. Mr. Li was a philosopher. He first supported Nietzsche's theories, and then underwent several transformations, but he was always pursuing the truth. He believed that in order to escape suffering, one must first be able to endure pain, so he constantly persevered upwards.</p>
<p>Of course, in an era where scholars are commercialized, and there is jealousy and exclusion, he could not avoid being attacked and slandered by others. He was like a white candle, purely burning his own life. In the light of electric lamps, his own brilliance and greatness seemed invisible, but I firmly believe that temporary clouds cannot cover the clear sky for long.</p>
<p>His lectures, although he did not call roll, were always full, and there were often people who could not get seats and had to stand and listen, or sit on the podium next to the lectern. His sincere attitude and demeanor seemed to be the embodiment of truth. Anyone would be influenced by him. But he never had the deceit of a sophist; he had the demeanor of a pure scholar. Under the combined assault of depression and financial hardship, a perfect person in the academic world was sacrificed. What he left us is a passion, an infinitely strong force of truth. We should eliminate general academic peddlers and inherit Mr. Li's spirit of scholarship.</p>
<h3>God's Masterpiece</h3>
<p>— Yue</p>
<h3>Iron Tree</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>"This is an iron tree. Although it looks like a section of dead wood now, it will sprout in the future." Last year, one day, a friend brought me something and said this to me.</p>
<p>I thanked him and took what he gave me. It was a section of dead tree that had been sawn off and planted in a ceramic pot.</p>
<p>"Iron tree? Can dead wood still sprout?" I listened to my friend's words, and my heart was full of suspicion. I casually put it in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>After that, I still watered it from time to time, but it didn't show any signs of sprouting.</p>
<p>This spring, I transplanted it from the pot to a small garden, intending to let it get more natural rain and dew. But it was still silent. I had almost completely given up hope of it sprouting.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one morning in the summer, I unintentionally discovered a tender sprout coming out next to this piece of dead wood. I was so surprised that I shouted out, "The iron tree can still come back to life after all!"</p>
<p>Now, this sprout has gradually grown into a small tree. Its lush green leaves are still as luxuriant as ever in this cold and windy weather.</p>
<p>"One should never despair of anything in the world," I thought.</p>
<p>This resurrected iron tree gave me the inspiration that "life must have a strong power." This iron tree gave me the symbol that "life must be fought to the end."</p>

<p>Personality Sketches</p>
<h3>Cheng Yaosheng and Hu Shi</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The old painter Mr. Cheng Yaosheng has recently become the subject of social gossip due to an abandonment case. I was once a student under Mr. Cheng when he was teaching at Caoqiao Middle School in Wuzhong, so yesterday I visited him. The old gentleman looked very frail, and his eyes were blind. When a guest arrived, he had to call out his name to identify him. When I arrived, Mr. Cheng was very happy and recounted the lawsuit, saying that he was in a declining state in his old age and had encountered this unexpected storm. He said that the accusations were completely fabricated, which was something he never could have imagined. In short, he had always held the belief that blessings should not be enjoyed alone, and that if one was blessed by heaven, one should share it with others. However, those who did not understand him thought he had an abundance and possessed vast wealth, and therefore coveted it. In fact, he was in a poor situation, especially in recent years. Therefore, he never had two meat dishes for a meal and never had his own car to travel. Even all the utensils he used were bought cheaply from Beijing Road, mismatched and untidy. Upon inspection, the stools were broken, the table was damaged, and there was a jumble of clutter. There were absolutely no luxurious items. The most laughable thing was that one end of the painting table was still intact, while the other end was missing, so it was supported by two upright kerosene wooden boxes. On the table were several outdated photographs, leaving traces of his past glory, which were worth commemorating. I happened to notice a group photograph of teachers and students of the New China Public School. Hu Shi, the literary giant of today, was there. Mr. Yaosheng and he had been at the same school for many years and were very close. Shi had even written a poem for Mr. Yaosheng. I copied it down in pencil: "Knowing that Wu and Yue are in the same boat, but the raging waves shake the earth. Birds still circle the trees above the river, and the remaining butterflies before you have turned to ash. The fleeting epiphyllum leaves only regrets, and the lingering marks of wild geese are also pitiful. Do not laboriously make straw dogs, but discuss the flavor to the dark green moss." At that time, Shi had not yet engaged in the New Culture Movement, so his work still had a sharp, ornate rhyme.</p>
<h3>Umeya Shokichi</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The newspaper on November 20th carried a "Tokyo dispatch from Japan Alliance News Agency" stating that "Mr. Umeya Shokichi, a Japanese national who has a close relationship with the Chinese Revolution, is suffering from a stomach ulcer. He passed away at his villa in Chiba Prefecture on the 23rd. Mr. Umeya was a native of Nagasaki and went to Shanghai at the age of 23. He interacted with Sun Yat-sen and other key figures in the Chinese Revolution and made great contributions to the Chinese revolutionary cause." This part of history, now that Umeya has passed away, I am afraid very few people know the details. Therefore, I will write a few words about it. About five years ago, Umeya brought the portrait of the late Premier, which he had cast, and his family from Japan to our China, and personally went to the capital to pay homage to his spirit. He did not hesitate to travel a long distance, spending a huge amount of money, and all out of personal action. At first, everyone was a little strange. Perhaps some people still remember this matter! I don't know if Umeya was really an old friend of Mr. Zhongshan. As the historical record says, "True friendship is seen in life and death." Among the Japanese who have come to our China, no one, no matter who they are, can have a good impression of him. However, Umeya alone, I think, is impossible not to know about his loyal and chivalrous heart. Even when he and Mr. Zhongshan were socializing overseas, I am afraid that there was only this one person!</p>
<p>Umeya probably opened a photography studio around 1894 or 1895 at No. 8 Central Road, Hong Kong. His store was called "Umetani." Later, through the introduction of the Westerner Kang Deli, he became friends with Mr. Zhongshan. Mr. Zhongshan also felt very close to him, chatting with him day and night, sometimes until late at night, and staying at Umeya's place. Do you think they were close friends? When Mr. Zhongshan was in trouble and went to London, Umeya, although in Hong Kong, still entrusted a pastor named Ou Fengshi to secretly relay messages on his behalf. When he received the shocking news that Mr. Zhongshan was missing, he tried to find his whereabouts and prepared for him to escape to Japan. Therefore, at that time, Heiwa Heishū, Miyazaki Torazo (i.e., White Wave Raging Sky), and others all got to know Mr. Zhongshan. Even the progressive figures in the Min Party, like Inukai Tsuyoshi and others, also deeply believed in the Premier, all of which can be said to be due to Umeya's efforts in promoting him.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhongshan first wanted to go to Taiwan according to Chen Shaobai's suggestion. Umeya returned to Japan and strongly opposed it, thinking that "Taiwan belongs to the Manchus, and Japan is safer." Therefore, Mr. Zhongshan used the Zhongshan Marquis's residence as a temporary dwelling, calling himself "Zhongshan," and it became his name from then on. At that time, it coincided with the failure of the Reform Movement of 1898 in our country, and Kang and Liang also fled to Japan. Umeya mistakenly thought that they were also revolutionaries and could form comrades. Before long, Umeya regretted his difficulty in recognizing people in front of Mr. Zhongshan. I still remember that Mr. Zhongshan gave a speech somewhere in Shanghai, which he personally spoke about. Now that I see the news of Umeya's death in the newspaper, I wrote this article.</p>

<h3>Banning Students from Entering Dance Halls</h3>
<p>Universities Should Take Multiple Approaches</p>
<p>Presidents and Faculty Should Lead by Example by Abstaining from Dance Halls</p>
<p>Promote Wholesome Entertainment to Divert Students' Impulses</p>
<p>Students Must Wear Uniforms at All Times for Identification</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Sent a Notice to Universities Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday sent a notice to all public and private universities in the city regarding the ban on university students entering dance halls, citing Ordinance No. 11658 from the Municipal Government, which stated: "Referring to the letter from the Shanghai University Federation stating, 'Respectfully, the Federation passed a resolution at its third executive committee meeting on October 27 to ban students from entering dance halls. The Federation has written to the Municipal Government to request that it find a way to investigate and notify the original schools at any time, and that the Federation will send a notice to all schools to strictly enforce the ban and immediately expel such students.' As dance halls abound in Shanghai, students from various schools often easily enter dance halls, leading to the moral corruption of young people, not only neglecting their studies but also causing lifelong harm. The Federation deeply sympathizes with this. Now that the New Life Movement is about to be implemented, it is noted that various countries in the East and West have precedents for banning students from entering dance halls, and the dance halls have announced that they do not accept students. Therefore, we are writing to your esteemed government to find a way to investigate and notify the original schools at any time to expel them immediately, which will greatly benefit the future of education. This is an order to investigate and report back.' Upon receipt of this, it is noted that the majority of dance halls in the city are located in the concessions. In addition to having the Bureau submit a request to the Municipal Government to consult with the authorities of the First and Second Special Districts to order all dance halls within the special districts not to admit students for dancing, the Boards of Directors of the various special districts should also send personnel to jointly investigate and prohibit with the personnel sent by the Bureau to the various dance halls in person. If students are found dancing in the halls, the school they belong to will be identified, notified to expel them, and notified to all schools not to allow them to transfer. Furthermore, the major middle schools in the city should be ordered to strictly restrain the students in school, provide constant guidance, explain the great principles, and make clear the advantages and disadvantages. The presidents and faculty of each school should especially lead by example, abstaining from dance halls to be a practical model. Friendly venues should be urgently established within the schools, educational films should be screened, wholesome entertainment should be promoted, and strict military training should be implemented to divert students' impulses and regulate their weary bodies and minds. Students must wear uniforms at all times, whether in or out of school, for identification and may not wear other clothing. The schools should find ways to contact the families of the students, notify them of the situation at any time to provide mutual assistance, and encourage students to supervise each other. If any abnormal behavior is discovered, it should be reported to the teachers for investigation and punishment. With both sides working together, it should be easier to salvage the situation. In addition to reporting back at any time for verification, the corresponding notice is sent to your esteemed school, hoping that you will investigate and implement it and reply accordingly."</p>

Immediately after, speeches were given, with much humility and briefly recounting the history of the affiliated high school. The meaning of the two characters Li Xue (endeavor and learning) was explained to encourage the students.

The ceremony concluded at about 11:00 AM, after which Principal Li and Director Yin accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Shao, Director Pan, and other guests on a tour of the classrooms and dormitories.

At 11:30 AM, a review was held, with the students' lines orderly and their spirits high, which was highly commended. The student army also performed field exercises, and the Boy Scouts performed bridge building, flag signaling, and so on. For a time, cannons roared, and hand-thrown grenades were launched simultaneously, with smoke filling the air and a thunderous sound, almost as if on a battlefield. At 12:30 PM, everyone gathered at the Boy Scout headquarters for a meal. In the afternoon, the alumni, faculty, and all students competed in basketball and various games, with cheers resounding throughout. At about 3:00 PM, the entertainment began, with a variety of programs, including songs and dances by Fudan Elementary School and Fudan Charity Elementary School, as well as dramas and music by students from both the senior and junior high school departments.

<h3>Shen Yuan Middle School Sports Federation Soccer Match</h3>
<p>Bloody Tragedy Occurs</p>
<p>Yuqing Wins 3-1 Over Jinan</p>
<p>Result of the Attack: Six Yuqing Players Seriously Injured</p>
<p>The Xie Jin Hui Office Was Smashed</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Middle School Sports Federation soccer competition, Jinan High School and Yuqing Middle School had equal scores in the "Shang" group.

In the second half, Yuqing scored two goals, resulting in a 3-1 victory for Yuqing. After the defeat, the Jinan students were resentful and, in a fit of rage, attacked the Yuqing players and students with weapons, causing an unprecedented bloody tragedy in the sports world. It is reported that one of the leaders of the attack from Jinan is a well-known middle-distance runner in our country. The principal of Yuqing Middle School will file a lawsuit to resolve the matter through legal channels.</p>
<p>Details of the Attack: After the match, the Jinan cheering squad, like wolves and tigers, attacked and beat the Yuqing players and students. They used fists and feet, iron bars, and wooden clubs, and some even threatened with handguns. Seeing the situation was not good, Yuqing fled into the Xie Jin Hui writing room, and the Xie Jin Hui staff closed the door, thinking they were protecting them. However, the Jinan students, still enraged, swarmed forward and smashed all the glass windows of the writing room, breaking down the door and entering. The Yuqing students were like turtles in a jar, at the mercy of the attackers' beating. The writing room was also smashed to pieces, with blood all over the floor. Six people from Yuqing were seriously injured, and countless others were slightly injured.</p>
<p>Detained in the Sixth District: The Shen Yuan soccer field is located in the Chinese territory, under the jurisdiction of the Caojiadu Sixth District. Seeing the situation was not good, the Sports Association reported to the police station, which immediately dispatched police officers to the scene to suppress the violence and arrest several students. Later, officials from both schools sent people to the police station to request the release of the students. The police station released the detained students. The principal of Yuqing School immediately sent the injured to the hospital and plans to file a lawsuit against Jinan.</p>
<p>Injury Statistics: Six students from Yuqing Middle School were seriously injured: Liang Tiemin, 20 years old, from Guangdong, internal injuries; Wu Shoufu, 19 years old, from Fujian, head injury; Shen Qiusheng, 18 years old, local, left leg injury; Zheng Fei, 24 years old, local, left eye injury; Wu Jiugao, 23 years old, local, waist injury; Zhang Guanjin, 20 years old, local, head injury. They were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment by the school principal.</p>

<h3>Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School</h3>
<p>Basketball Team Wins Three Straight in Beijing</p>
<p>The Liangjiang basketball team's expedition to various ports on the Beijing-Shanghai line has repeatedly achieved victories, and its battles have been continuously published in this newspaper. The team arrived in Beijing the day before yesterday and had its first battle in the Central University gymnasium against the Zhongda Youqun team. The people of Beijing were shocked by Liangjiang's past prestige, and those who came to watch were extremely crowded. As the music began, the two sides made contact. Liangjiang was elite and good at fighting. Although the Youqun team relied on its height and strength, it fought bravely but was ultimately no match. As a result, the Youqun team suffered a crushing defeat of 48 to 16. Next, they met with the China Women's High School at the school's field. There were more spectators than during the battle with Zhongda, and the situation was very lively. Huang Jianwu served as the referee. As a result, Liangjiang won again with a score of 44 to 9. The third game was against the Women's Political Science Institute. The location was a public sports field, and the referee was Zhang Dongping. The Liangjiang team's performance was extremely brilliant, and the Law and Politics team was far from being able to match it. In the end, Liangjiang defeated the Law and Politics team with a score of 62 to 2. Overall, the Liangjiang team won all three games in Beijing, and its performance was unmatched, giving the people of Beijing a deep impression. The team has finished its competition in Beijing and will return to Shanghai within one or two days.</p>

<h3>Qualifications of a Critic</h3>
<p>— Xinren</p>
<p>We have read many articles about criticism, but they all seem to lack a basis. For example, criticism should be correct, critics should be fair, and so on. However, it seems that not many people emphasize the importance of the critic's own life experience. In fact, this point is a crucial element for criticism.</p>
<p>Writers should have profound life experiences, and critics are no exception. If a critic is detached from life's realities, he cannot understand the life reflected in the work. He may quote extensively and write impressive critical essays, but such criticism (if it can be called criticism at all) is irrelevant to the writer and the reader. Because he can only rely on his own narrow subjectivity, he is prone to making superficial and erroneous judgments.</p>
<p>Of course, a critic must have a broad understanding of artistic theories, but as the cornerstone of his worldview, he should also be familiar with social sciences and even natural sciences, and grasp the correct methodology. Art criticism analyzes the degree of truthfulness of the reality reflected in the work, elucidates the author's consciousness and attitude towards society and life, and thereby attaches social value to the work. Artists use images to construct works, while critics use logic to analyze them. The tools critics use to express their ideas are the same as those of science, and critics always touch upon social issues when analyzing works. Therefore, social sciences and even natural sciences are essential basic knowledge for critics. On this foundation, they can then build their specialized knowledge of criticism.</p>
<p>However, just as technical skill alone cannot make a true writer, theoretical cultivation alone cannot make a critic. They must also have profound life experience, because only through life experience can they understand reality. Criticism is ridiculed by writers partly because in today's society, "fairness" is not absolute but relative; it is fair to the majority but not to the privileged few. Therefore, current criticism either receives welcome from the majority and ridicule from the minority, or vice versa. On the other hand, the lack of life experience and correct understanding on the part of critics is also a key factor in criticism being ridiculed. In this case, critical theory becomes dogma, becomes constitution, and the critic becomes an empty commander.</p>
<p>A true critic possesses both correct theoretical knowledge and profound life experience. He can understand the writer's creative process and all aspects of life. He can concretely help writers complete great works. The greatest mistake in the world is the one we make without realizing it, and critics have the responsibility to point out the writer's negligence, difficulties, and errors. In this way, creation is enriched by criticism, and criticism will also be enriched by creation.</p>
<p>Only those with such "qualifications" can be considered "critics."</p>
<h3>Waste of Water</h3>
<p>— Lingmo</p>
<p>Returning to my hometown, I realized that this year's famine is far more severe than I knew. In our small village, the surrounding fields are known to be free from drought and flood, but also because they are considered good fields, the ideal standard is to harvest four or five *shi* of grain per *mu*. We have never seen this standard reached; every year we hear that the harvest is not good. Although this year's disaster is quite widespread, our area has never felt the threat of drought. It is located by the river, and we can utilize the tide. This year the tide is not small, so in theory, we should not feel a lack of water. So, the talk of a bad harvest is just the same old story, right?</p>
<p>My guess was not entirely wrong. In a larger area, the so-called tidal towns and *wei* nearby, which constantly feel the threat of water and rely on earthen dikes for life, have all opened the dikes to draw water this year, and irrigation is very good, with almost a full harvest—their standards are originally lower. But in our small place, the main fields are not by the river, but on both sides of a small river. Two or three *li* from the river mouth, the riverbank is almost level with high tide; two or three *li* further up, high tide reaches half the river; above that, the tide cannot reach, but the river is in the valley of a small mountain, and usually after the snow melts or after several spring rains, the mountain water can accumulate to fill the river. Originally, there were earthen dams in sections to store water, but they are rarely used. In recent years, there has been too much water, and often because water was originally stored, sudden mountain water comes and cannot be discharged in time, which damages the fields. The function of the dams has gradually been forgotten, and the dams have gradually been washed away by the mountain water, leaving only remnants. The mud flows into the river and into the Yangtze River. Some sediment settles midway, some flows to the river mouth and is pushed back by the tide, resting at the river mouth. Very little actually flows into the Yangtze River. As a result, the riverbed rises day by day, and the river mouth silts up day by day. When the tide comes, no plans are made. After the tide goes out, we wait another half month. Half a month later, everyone draws water, but the manpower and tools for drawing water are not enough to manage, and the crops cannot wait another half month. So we sit and wait for famine.</p>
<p>Because of this year's lesson, the locals also thought of repairing the river, in addition to preparing to dig it deeper, they are still building dams. This decision has not yet been implemented and is feared to be delayed until next year. If next year is a water year again, this proposal will eventually disappear. In a place that averages over 1,000 millimeters of rainfall per year, the neglect of water storage is very obvious. In fact, there is no way to not neglect it. If we prepare to store water but do not know what the fundamental solution is, just following the methods of storing water in dry land really feels like a redundant tumor when the rainfall is balanced.</p>
<p>A small river in my hometown is a very small issue, of course, but by analogy, the situation of larger rivers, even the Yangtze River and the Nile River, is similar. Usually, we only fear that the water in the river does not flow fast enough, and when it floods, we only complain that the lakes and marshes downstream are not large enough to store water. We never think that the source above will be cut off, so we never bother to prevent the source from being completely exhausted. Before the British built the Nile Dam, the Egyptians never considered the flooding of the great river to be irresistible, and never felt that too much water was wasted, when this excess water could have been diverted for other uses.</p>
<p>Of course, projects like the Nile River cannot necessarily be applied to the Yangtze River, and even the smallest project may not be worth implementing on a small river like the one in my hometown. However, there must be many similar methods that can be adopted. I do not have the knowledge to specifically point out which one, but suppose there were reservoirs in Dabie Mountain, Hongze Lake could reduce flooding, and the upstream could reap more irrigation benefits. Also, if Shaanxi had plateau lakes like Dianchi Lake in Yunnan, it would not suffer from repeated droughts. Although there are no natural ones, it seems not impossible to remedy them with artificial ones.</p>
<p>It seems that the result is the same old saying: it depends on human effort. Most river channels have already fallen into disrepair because of human inaction. As long as we start doing it again, no matter which aspect we start with, it will only be better. But I think the upstream water should be a more fundamental and convenient solution.</p>
<h3>Returning from the Volcano (1)</h3>
<p>— Lanru</p>
<p>The goddess of autumn arrives gracefully in the world, just when I am leaving my warm southern country. Now that I see her quietly departing, I feel endless sorrow and melancholy in my heart. I curse winter, that death-freezing demon. Once it arrives in the world, the howling north wind, the torrential rain, the gloom, the darkness, everything follows.</p>
<p>Autumn in Japan is beautiful. The number of young men and women, poets and literati viewing the autumn leaves may even be greater than those viewing the cherry blossoms. Although I did not see the autumn leaves this time, my friends laughed at me for failing to live up to autumn. However, I feel that I have not only not failed to live up to it, but I have completely possessed it. Although it was only a short day's work, I feel that the beauty of autumn in the human world has been admired by me alone.</p>
<p>Ever since I heard Mr. Qin propose a trip to Mount Mihara volcano, I was so excited that I hardly slept all night. I thought, even if I didn't have a penny, I would borrow money from friends to travel this time. It doesn't matter if I don't go to Nikko Hakone, but this famous volcano, the site of suicides, I must explore it once. I begged several friends to go with me, but they all answered me in tones of surprise and warning:</p>
<p>"It's dangerous! You can't go there!" Several newly acquainted Japanese friends, when they heard that I was going to Mount Mihara, all stuck out their tongues and said, "It's dangerous! Don't say goodbye to us!"</p>
<p>But I finally went.</p>
<h3>Who is Going to Sayonara? (Note)</h3>
<p>At 8:30 on the evening of November 10th, our party of seven arrived at Reigan Island. Mr. Qin went to buy tickets for us, and we all stood in the waiting room observing the expressions on each traveler's face.</p>
<p>"Look, let's guess who in here is going to sayonara." Mr. Jingyi reminded us to pay more attention to and scrutinize each traveler's expression and tone of voice.</p>
<p>The ship docked outside the door of the waiting room. As soon as the door opened, everyone boarded the ship in the order they were standing. This seemed to be a new discovery for me. I forgot that this was an island. Like a villager coming to the city for the first time, I felt surprised. Why can the ship go ashore?</p>
<p>Because we arrived relatively late, the good cabins were all taken by those who went ahead. We squeezed into the steerage at the stern of the ship, with only a foot of space for each person to lie down.</p>
<p>The ship departed at 9:00. I heard it would take until 4:30 the next morning to reach Oshima Island. This long night was a bit frightening. The sea breeze was strong, and we didn't bring blankets. We could have rented one on the ship for twenty cents, but because there were so many tourists today, even blankets were not available for rent. Actually, we could have taken off our clothes to use as blankets, but the only thing I had never experienced in my life was the crowding of people against people. On both sides were Japanese people. Only Ms. Yang and I were Chinese. They squeezed tightly against us, sometimes even putting their feet on us. I tried my best to kick them away, but after a while, they would come again.</p>
<h3>Sky Bridge</h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>The tram tracks stop in the middle of the plaza, with cloth curtains and stalls on both sides, leaving only a few pedestrian walkways for people to pass through.</p>
<p>Coming on foot or stepping down from trams and rickshaws, the footprints of those who ride in cars probably wouldn't appear here. Here, you really feel the prosperity of China's population. The sound of people helps your eyes, making you feel like it's a dazzling scene, with people like bees among flowers, sucking up the nectar and still panting.</p>
<p>The hawkers' cries:</p>
<p>"Bargain sale! Six plates for half a dollar, two piles for a dollar!"</p>
<p>"Foreign flower bunting, one dollar for two *zhang*!"</p>
<p>It sounds so energetic, sung as a tune, repeated over and over again, with the blue veins on their temples bulging. Why not find Japanese trademarks on those clever little toys? But now the wave of inspecting Japanese goods has passed, and buyers and sellers understand each other tacitly. On the other hand, the copper and tinware shining in the sunlight are genuine Chinese goods. The old woman is there picking incense burners and candle holders, and the tea-addicted old men are suspiciously eyeing the purple copper teapots, feeling for the coins in their pockets.</p>
<p>In the used clothing store, under the apprentices' singing and laughter, old cotton-padded jackets and broken cotton quilts are being flipped through. Winter has arrived, and men who can't redeem anything from the pawnshop come to browse these stalls, carefully negotiating the price:</p>
<p>"Too expensive, the lining is completely yellowed and blackened. Who knows what the cotton inside is like..."</p>
<p>"We can take it apart and show you, the price is fair." The young clerk is excited to see someone asking, most afraid of those who look and shake their heads and leave.</p>
<p>The fortune-teller's table has a human face hanging on it, with the ears, eyes, nose, and lips filled with words like a map. Few people are absentmindedly throwing money anymore; people are slowly using their money for more practical purposes. Sixteen coins can buy a brown dried cake!</p>
<p>Women with rolled-up trouser legs linger in front of the paper flower stalls, and newlywed brides with painted faces and red and green robes are also strolling on the bridge, asking this and that in low voices, and hurriedly dodging when the water carriers come to sprinkle soil on the road, wearing rose-red embroidered shoes.</p>
<p>The street performers' stalls are crowded with people watching the "eighteen transformations." If you're unlucky, you're forced to throw in a big coin; if you're smart, you watch half of it and slip away. Those eloquent and energetic heroes of the streets perform one routine after another, with saliva flying straight into the faces of the audience.</p>
<p>Bicycles skillfully weave through the crowd, and the bicycle shop is piled with old bikes and parts.</p>
<p>A sign is posted in front of the teahouse: "Water money, one large coin; upstairs, three small coins." But it's really full of friends in short clothes. Those who go upstairs to look out are wearing an air of arrogance and pride.</p>
<p>The busiest places here are the leather goods stores. Clerks walk up three steps and pull at customers, their energetic cries reminiscent of the prostitutes on Sima Road. These leather shops are clustered in groups of five or six, struggling to survive even though customers are so rare.</p>
<p>Going south from the Sky Bridge is the execution ground. Curious people inquire about the news, and old hands will stroke their chins and smile:</p>
<p>"They executed one this morning, without even interrogating him first!"</p>
<p>People flow like water toward the Sky Bridge. There is no high threshold here. Many people below the poverty line remember it. Although this Sky Bridge seems to be a Ground Bridge, filled with people sighing in life, in their eyes, it is a Sky Bridge in hell.</p>
<h3>Cocoon (1)</h3>
<p>— (Original by Hayao Hayashi) Translated by Jingzi</p>
<p>Whenever I see cocoons, I think of Sakai Yasuo. However, I am now a city person—a city person who can only see decorations of the moon and reeds in shop windows to feel that autumn has arrived. I no longer have the opportunity to see the single-wheeled carts carrying raw cocoon cages swaying along the country roads where flying crows knock down the fruits of the rough-leaved trees.</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>Sakai and I were friends in middle school. In the same dormitory, in the same room, we sat side by side at small desks, loving each other like twins.</p>
<p>Behind the middle school was a hill covered with small pine trees. In early summer, many wildflowers were scattered around the roots of these small pines, and small snakes with striped patterns meandered in these white wildflower clumps.</p>
<p>"A sharp and bright thing!"</p>
<p>Sometimes, he would always say this in a sentimental way while chasing after the small snake, whose scales reflected the early summer sun, quietly hiding in the flower clumps.</p>
<p>"A sharp and bright thing!" Saying this sentence probably had some meaning for him. Because he was often called a "dirty thing" by his ill-tempered classmates, a nickname that shattered his fragile little soul. He always wore tattered clothes. Therefore, when he talked about the snake, it probably contained some envy. He was born with a clever mind and always ranked first in his class. It could be said that he was extremely intelligent, but it could also be said that he was extremely poor, which was a very good contrast to me, who was neither very intelligent nor very poor. I was his only confidant and his only sympathizer. If he owed tuition, I would unhesitatingly take out part of my allowance.</p>
<p>In short, in the middle school dormitory at the foot of the hill, we sat side by side at small desks, loving each other like twins.</p>
<p>From the top of the hill, you could see the sea. The two middle school students often climbed this hill, throwing small stones that would never reach the blue paint dish under the clear sky. Sometimes, they would sing the out-of-tune "Amour River" duet while walking down this hill.</p>
<p>One day, we two were walking on the hill when we saw a snake swallowing a frog. The snake seemed to be opening its mouth so wide that its lower jaw was about to fall off. The suction cups of the frog's feet were exposed outside the snake's mouth, trembling as if begging for help. I saw Sakai's eyebrows twitching. Suddenly, his gray-white shoes kicked the snake's body desperately, and then he stepped on the snake's head with his shoes. A red thread of blood flowed from the flat yellow snake lips. He cursed angrily:</p>
<p>"Beast!"</p>
<p>The frog was finally saved. Its head was covered with the sticky saliva of the snake, and it lay motionless on the grass.</p>
<p>"Beast! Beast!"</p>
<p>Sakai cursed angrily again. About the snake, I only remember this one incident.</p>

<h3>Finance: Floating Long Positions Continue to be Liquidated</h3>
<p>Benchmark Gold Falls Two Yuan</p>
<p>丨Major Players Vigorously Buy to Provide Significant Support丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a strong rise in British silver, a general market weakness, and the continued liquidation of floating long positions. However, due to HSBC's vigorous buying of shillings and Dachen's efforts to buy in, the day's market conditions were maintained. It was easier to rise than to fall during the day. In the morning, overseas silver markets in both Britain and the United States rose consistently. After the big speculators closed the market, transactions took place above the listed price of 125. Montri forward silver prices rose three to four li, exchange rates slightly contracted, and London spot gold rose by half a penny. The off-exchange preliminary transaction opened, then immediately retreated to 91.2 yuan. Fuxingyong and others took the opportunity to buy at low prices, which helped to pull the price up. The Central Bank's announced exchange rates showed that both British and American rates were flat, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The benchmark gold standard price was listed at 1006.1 yuan, which had little impact. The morning opened with a low market, which was extremely stable after the opening, hovering only. However, because major players had a strong buying appetite and floating short positions also entered the market, the situation gradually improved. Banks also engaged in cover-buying. HSBC's listed exchange rates for British and American currencies remained unchanged, and demand exceeded supply after entry, once rebounding. However, due to pressure from those taking advantage of high prices, the price gradually fell. The silver equalization tax was announced, rising 2.5 li, calculated at 6.25 percent, with the British exchange rate calculated at one shilling five and three-one-two-five pence. It still struggled, but morale was not greatly boosted. Sellers continued to be active, and the domestic market gradually loosened. Despite major players' vigorous buying on dips, the crowd could not withstand their enemies. Despite much struggle, it was difficult to sustain. The price once approached the 90 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, some short positions were covered on dips, and major players continued to buy vigorously, and the price rebounded again. The market hovered uncertainly. The market was still calm at noon. In the afternoon, the market was stable, but due to the disappointment of floating long holders, they continued to liquidate. Sellers took the opportunity to be active, so even though the exchange market was stable, it still declined. Major players vigorously bought in to support the price, contending for a long time around the 90 yuan mark. Then, due to the initial report of 8 anna rise in Indian silver, the price fell once. However, the sellers were extremely fragmented, and major players continued to buy vigorously, sparing no effort, so the momentum of the decline was reversed in an instant and pulled up. HSBC continued to cover-buy shillings, and the exchange market remained tight, immediately rebounding. However, morale was still difficult to revive. After entry, a second telegram from Indian silver reported no change, and the price fell slightly again, but major players' buying intentions did not stop. After that, the overall market was stable, hovering only. It was observed that the market sentiment was tired throughout the day, and the remaining floating long positions continued to be liquidated, but the strength was ultimately weak, so Dachen was able to become the mainstay. The swap rate remained at 13 yuan. Today's market conditions are recorded below:</p>

Dachen and Tongfu supplied at high prices, and the price retreated to 1.4 yuan. Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, Fuxingyong, Renfayong, and Qianchangxiang bought in again to 2.4 yuan.

<p>Spot Cotton Transactions Completely Stalled. The spot cotton market became even more sluggish. Factories, approaching the end of the year, faced tighter credit and weakened purchasing appetite. Supplies included 2,268 bales of Yao cotton and 975 bales of Tong cotton. Spot cotton transactions were completely stalled.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Does Not Escape a Hovering Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the US cotton market opened, long positions in December and January were continuously liquidated due to increased delivery notices. At the same time, stock prices weakened, causing prices for all months to fall by two points. There were not many sellers. Later, due to purchases by peers and covering by local short positions, prices rebounded. Currently, the market situation does not escape a hovering situation. Government loans and sufficient funds prevent selling pressure. The sale of stockpiled cotton may also discourage buyers. The closing was firm, with prices for all months rising by one to eight points. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, and futures prices rose by one to eight points. UK spot cotton rose by two points, and futures fell by one or two points. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by brokers and European exporters. Nagpur rose by 0.25 rupees, Omra fell by 0.25 rupees, and Broach fell by one rupee. Original telegram recorded (19th dispatch).</p>

<h3>Sales Volume of Cotton Yarn in the First Ten Days of This Month</h3>
<p>| Decrease Compared to November |</p>
<p>According to a survey by a certain foreign firm in this port, the sales volume of Japanese and Chinese yarn shipped to various destinations in the first ten days of December totaled 4,367 bales, a decrease of 1,754 bales compared to the 6,121 bales in the last ten days of November. The sales volume of Chinese yarn shipped to various destinations totaled 10,877 bales, a decrease of 3,636 bales compared to the 14,513 bales in the last ten days of November.</p>
<p>The reason for the decrease in Chinese yarn sales is said to be the shrinking purchasing power in the South China region and the sluggish export of Japanese yarn overseas. The shipment quantities and destinations of Chinese and Japanese yarn are excerpted below (unit: bales):</p>

<h3>Grains: Futures for Flour and Wheat Remain Quiet</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market this morning, the market for all months generally presented a quiet and hovering picture. Chicago wheat futures fell by 0.40 yuan, and Canadian futures fell by 0.08 to 0.12 yuan. When prices opened, the market sentiment for this month was somewhat loose, with prices reportedly breaking the 0.5 jiao level. However, for deferred months, factories were active, while outside firms showed little movement, so the market sentiment stabilized. Consequently, this month's prices also stabilized. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading for all months became even quieter, with little activity from either side. This month remained stable due to continued buying interest from merchant firms. Deferred months weakened slightly due to some profit-taking by longs as foreign shipping rates rose. As a result, this month decreased by 0.005 yuan, January and February decreased by 0.0025 yuan, March remained unchanged, April increased by 0.0025 yuan, and May remained unchanged.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market this morning, the market for all months generally presented a quiet picture. Chicago wheat futures fell by 0.40 yuan, and Canadian futures fell by 0.08 to 0.10 yuan. When prices opened, trading for this month remained quiet. However, the sentiment was slightly weak due to the foreign wheat prices. Therefore, although trading was not active, prices decreased slightly. In the afternoon, trading remained weak, and prices were sluggish. As the settlement date approached, many contracts for this month were prepared for delivery. As a result, although spot prices did not loosen, the standard prices had difficulty improving. As a result, this month decreased by 0.01 yuan, January and February decreased by 0.02 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged. Spot wheat prices remained unchanged due to lack of factory buying interest and the continued refusal to open sales.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat reflects insufficient foreign demand and a lack of new buying. Domestic supply appears to be quite sufficient. Prices are unlikely to make significant progress before forecasts for the upcoming winter wheat harvest. The current situation for corn is characterized by sluggish sales, a loose spot market, and negative sentiment.</p>

<h3>River Rice Contains a Weak Sign</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Only about 30 sources of guests came, with a total of 5,000 shi of goods. All thick japonica rice from various sources maintained their old prices, but sales were average. The future trend is deeply weak. Although Qingdao continued to purchase nearly 1,000 bags of late rice, the market softened by a few points due to the unhealthy local appetite. Du Yang pointed rice was flat, while Yin Yuan rice seemed slightly tight due to its scarcity.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 17 ships from various river ports arrived, with 230-240 ships in the river. In terms of market sales, sales of white japonica rice bags turned sluggish. Local sales were average. Early rice and thin rice were still being transformed by Yang Du port guests, while Xian rice changed into a muddled and zero appetite. The recent sluggishness in the rice market is due to tight credit conditions. The market price of white japonica rice was slightly lower, while Yang Du port guest pointed early thin rice was stable. The price of Bian Yuan Yin Yuan rice fell by 0.1-0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lake Coarse Red Rice Falls by 0.15 Yuan</h3>
<p>| Price Negotiations for Small Spindle Not Agreed |</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the "foreign rice" market, cargo owners' intentions remained firm, unwilling to lower prices to sell. New arrivals had not yet been fully sampled, but too many arrivals were expected daily, and credit was extremely tight. Most buyers were watching. The whole market only had local merchants buying 1,000 bags of Saigon rice and 700 bags of inland broken rice. Futures were released by Yali for 500 tons and recovered for 300 tons. In addition, Hengyi and others were selling small spindles, asking for 4.85 yuan, but buyers found the price too high and did not agree. There were many other offers that could not be agreed upon. Therefore, although the price did not fall, the market was trending downwards. Yesterday, sales of "guest Xian" rice were slow for both local and inland merchants. Initially, cargo owners held firm, and prices did not fall. In the evening, inland merchants purchased 1,400 bags of Hunan coarse red rice at a price of 8.92 yuan, a sudden drop of 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day. Other rice types were also expected to fall.</p>
<h3>Yellow Soybeans Increasingly Demanded and Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival and inventory of soybeans in the market were thick, and the market was relatively stable, mainly because the appetite for purchases was strong. It is estimated that Tongzhou Chefang purchased four carts of Yingzhou Chen soybeans, with prices ranging from 3.63 yuan to 3.61 yuan.  A family purchased 1,400 bags of Guide soybeans, with prices ranging from 3.53 yuan to 3.55 yuan. They also purchased 1,000 bags of Guide green soybeans, with the price at 3.42 yuan. Additionally, 3,000 bags of Hankou Che soybeans were purchased, with prices ranging from 3.50 yuan to 3.20 yuan. Merchants from Xichang purchased 2,700 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans, with prices ranging from 3.35 yuan to 3.62 yuan, and 500 bags of Chi soybeans, with prices ranging from 3.25 yuan to 3.23 yuan. Also, 200 bags of Shashi soybeans were purchased, with the price at 3.25 yuan. The market price continued to rise by 0.02-0.03 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>Production Area Suffers Shortfall, Shanghai Inventory is Meager</p>
<p>New Season Rapeseed Oil Actively Soaring</p>
<p>Since the arrival of new rapeseed oil on the market, the market situation has become serious. Inventories everywhere have been exhausted. Zhejiang Province produces the earliest new oil, but this year, western Zhejiang is the most deficient. Compared to last year, it only accounts for 30%. Therefore, not only is there no oil available for sale in the Shanghai market, but Shanghai merchants are also purchasing Jing oil to make up for the shortfall. In the Shanghai market, whenever the new season arrives, new oil from Zhejiang Province is bound to arrive in abundance. Therefore, Shanghai merchants usually do not prepare much stock at that time. However, this year, the situation is the opposite. No new oil has arrived from Zhejiang Province, and merchants from Jiangxi Province are purchasing goods in Hankou instead. The new production areas in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces used to have a surplus, but now they are stretched. Since all areas cannot obtain new oil, they are flocking to the Hankou market to purchase old oil for sale. However, the old oil reserves in Hankou are not abundant. Once various merchants rush to purchase, the remaining stock is unexpectedly swept away. Subsequently, the goods en route are gradually sold out, and prices soar. The cost of transporting Jing and Han oil has increased to 12 taels. New goods from Macheng are arriving in succession, with four to five hundred pieces. All are being borrowed by various merchants. The asking price is likely to be between 11.5 and 11.6 taels. Recently, various regions have been sending letters to stop borrowing oil for fear that the borrowing will lead to a large price swing in the future, and they will wait for the opening before purchasing. Only about 50 pieces of Jiangxi oil arrived in this port. It is estimated that the price will be above 19 yuan. The oil is slightly damp. During this time of shortage, the distribution among various firms is barely sufficient, not to mention selection. The total market inventory is less than 500 pieces. With only this meager stock for a large city like Shanghai during peak sales, it is truly alarming. Therefore, the current selling price of heavy Jing oil has increased to 20 yuan per piece, but there is still no spot oil available and one must wait for the oil to be loaded. Jiaxing local oil needs to reach Shanghai at around 23 yuan, about 3 yuan higher than Jing oil. Users do not find it cost-effective, so no one has purchased it so far.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Local Factory Refined White Sugar Continues to Rise by 0.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to be tight. The association's benchmark price for 24 raw granulated sugar was 18.6 yuan for ordinary spot goods on the previous day. Those that had not been sold were sold yesterday for 18.62 yuan. The price of local factory goods rose by another 0.05 yuan to 18.7 yuan. Transshipment goods remained unchanged at 5.2 yuan. #8-9 Dutch red sugar was 14 yuan, and the next grade was 13.8 yuan, with transshipment goods at 4.9 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B brand rose by 0.05 yuan to 19.45 yuan. The price of local factory refined white sugar was also tight. Zhenyu No. 1 was 17.9 yuan, and No. 2 was 17.7 yuan, both rising by 0.2 yuan. No. 3 was 17.5 yuan, rising by 0.15 yuan, and No. 4 was 17.3 yuan, rising by 0.1 yuan. The Guangzhou wheel of the Taikoo Company arrived in Xinchao Qing yesterday from Swatow with 4,000 bags. Samples have not yet been seen, but the market is expected to open today, and there is likely to be a loosening trend.</p>

<h3>Love Letter Auction</h3>
<p>— Niu</p>
<p>Napoleon was originally a maverick of the world. He was both a despotic tyrant and an affectionate man. Therefore, he had many romantic affairs during his lifetime. According to a London telegram on the 17th, "Auction houses here today auctioned Napoleon's love letters. These love letters were sent by Napoleon to Queen Marie Louise, totaling 318 letters." Another telegram stated, "The French government recently purchased 300 handwritten letters from Napoleon I for £15,000, many of which have not been published." Another telegram stated, "Last year, eight love letters from Napoleon to his lover Josephine were sold for a total of £4,400."</p>
<p>Calculated in this way, the value of a love letter from Napoleon ranges from £50 to £550. The huge price of his love letters can be imagined. Therefore, the London auction house sold 318 love letters from Napoleon the day before yesterday for only £15,000, which is really very cheap. It is probably also due to the sluggishness of the British market, so it is still a blood-drenched bargain sale.</p>
<p>Speaking of love letters, my country produces the most in quantity, as rich as if they were manufactured by machines. Students above middle school, no matter how professors jump and shout on the podium, lecturing with gusto and in a flowery manner, like a feverish fool, but some students often squat in the corners of the classroom to write their love letters, hearing nothing. The clerks in the shops, because of the sluggish market and dull business, are also secretly writing love letters on the counters like dragons and snakes, very happily. If you have the power to check each post office every day, I guarantee you will find thousands, or at least hundreds, of love letters every day.</p>
<p>If these love letters were sold like Napoleon's love letters, not to mention the price of each love letter being £450, even if they were sold at a blood-drenched sacrifice, at a cheap price, with each love letter selling for only £50, I think not only can my country's national debt be completely repaid, but also my country's construction undertakings, and the airplanes and cannons used during the war, can all be funded with the price of love letters, and there would be more than enough. Wouldn't that be wonderful?</p>
<p>I once heard people say that love saves the country, and I was puzzled. How can love save the country? Only now do I know that, besides "flirting with the eyes and promising with the heart," love letters are an important tool. So-called love saving the country is actually love letters saving the country. I advise a few affectionate seeds to quickly write love letters to save the country.</p>
<h3>Speechless</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>(Anecdotal Experience)</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I took the train back to Songjiang for some business. I left early and returned late, buying a round-trip ticket to save a dime and five cents, which was a small but welcome saving. On the way back, I was extremely bored. Fortunately, I met a friend, Mr. So-and-so, and we chatted freely. We talked about world affairs, and then about a Songjiang middle school graduate who became a robber. (Because that day, the Rifeng Silver Shop on Songjiang West Gate Street was robbed, and the robber's name was Zhao Zhiyi, a graduate of Xuhui Public School.) We all gasped deeply, really having nothing to say.</p>
<p>Soon, the train arrived at Xin Zhuang. As usual, the tea room attendant came to collect the tea money. All friends who drink tea must "stretch their waists" and "break the bank." A passenger sitting next to me asked the attendant, how much is the tea money? The attendant replied, twenty cents. The man immediately looked surprised, saying, twenty cents for a cup of plain tea? How do you think the attendant replied? Sir, look at those gentlemen, some of whom normally don't drink tea. The gentlemen who do drink tea must be used to having everything. They definitely won't haggle over this. The man had nothing to say, so he took out twenty cents and gave it to the attendant.</p>
<p>My friend then said, when you go out, you should always act generously; you must not haggle over small things. This man haggled over a small thing, and even we were subjected to his "covert criticism." This attendant is really hateful, but there are many like him. If you haven't seen the world, you're bound to "hit your head" and "get a face full of dust" when you go out. Therefore, you must have some experience when you go out and know the "rules." Confucius said, "When entering a territory, ask what is prohibited; when entering a country, ask about customs," which is the same principle. The other day, I heard a few things that made me blush and become speechless. Let me tell you about them..." (The following are facts told by my friend.)</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. So-and-so, returned from Shanghai to Songjiang the other day, taking a second-class train. Midway, he felt a bit hungry, so he ordered</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>a plate of curry chicken rice. After eating, he asked how much it cost. The waiter replied, thirty cents. Mr. So-and-so said, I'm used to paying twenty-five cents; I've never paid thirty cents. The waiter smiled and replied, sir, you're used to sitting in third class; this is second class, so it must be thirty cents. Mr. So-and-so had nothing to say.</p>
<p>My friend also said, last month, I went to a restaurant with two or three friends. We ordered a few dishes casually, including a "zha ba." Later, when the bill came, the "zha ba" was priced at eighty cents. I was surprised it was so expensive. I said, "zha ba" is just a small dish; you want to sell it to us for eighty cents? The waiter then smiled and said, sir, do you know what "zha ba" is? I was stunned. How could I know its origins? The waiter, seeing that I couldn't answer, then said, what is "zha ba"? "Zha ba" is taking a whole young chicken, removing the head, feet, and shoulders, cutting it into eight pieces, and then frying it in a pan. That's called "zha ba kuai." Selling you a chicken for eighty cents, how can you say it's expensive? I also had nothing to say.</p>
<p>There's one more thing. This summer, I came to Shanghai with three friends to shop. After eating dinner, we were very bored in the hotel. Mr. So-and-so suggested, why don't we hire a car to take a ride? It's really boring to sit here. Three yuan for an hour can exchange for some fresh air and see the scenery of the foreign concession. I was the first to agree, and the other two friends also said it was a good idea. So, we called a convertible car from a nearby car company, specifying an hour's ride. At that time, Mr. So-and-so looked at his watch, which was 9:45. So, we went from the main road to the Bund, to Jing'an Temple, and other places. After a while, the driver said the time was up. The car stopped. Mr. So-and-so took out his watch and looked. It wasn't even 10:30 yet. So, he said to the driver, we started at 9:45, and it's not even 10:30 now. How can you say the time is up? The driver looked at the watch on his wrist, snorted, and said, I bought my watch for one hundred and twenty taels of silver. How can your few-dollar watch be accurate? Mr. So-and-so also had nothing to say.</p>
<h3>Winter Droppings</h3>
<p>— Shixing</p>
<p>Beside the Stove</p>
<p>Seeing the chimney extending from the crystal-clear glass window of the house opposite, slowly emitting warm smoke, my wife said sadly...</p>
<p>"When will we be able to install a stove!"</p>
<p>"It's early."</p>
<p>"But isn't there already a thick layer of frost on the roof tiles at night?"</p>
<p>"But shouldn't we endure the cold as we endure poverty, and strengthen ourselves in the cold?"</p>
<p>"I know you're deliberately trying to freeze me to death."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but get angry at such hysterical, unfeeling words... "Then why did you marry a poor wretch like me?" I mocked her like that. To avoid arguing with her, I walked out, but regretted it when I got to the street. It was November, the beginning of winter. I could endure the cold, but what reason was there to force my wife, who was wearing a thin cotton robe and suffering from a lingering illness, to endure the cold with me?</p>
<p>The people in the movie theater seemed to have forgotten winter.</p>
<p>The next day, I pawned my only ornament, my engagement ring, and rented a stove. In the evening, I lit a fire in the house.</p>
<p>Looking at the friendly firelight emerging from the burning coals in the corner of the room, I happily raised my head... "Come sit by the stove," I said to my wife, but I saw a quiet, tearful, haggard face.</p>
<p>"Why, why are you still crying like that? Isn't there already a stove, and haven't you been consumed enough by sorrow?"</p>
<p>My wife stared at me for a long time, then said with pity... "A stove is too luxurious for us!"</p>
<p>It was incomprehensible that my very vain wife would consider a stove a luxury, and wasn't she the one who asked for it? As I was wondering, she stroked my face and said... "Look at yourself; this year of poverty has already turned you into a thirty-year-old middle-aged man."</p>
<p>Shaking off her hand, I sat down silently by the stove. My heart was like being covered in dust, becoming increasingly gloomy, while outside the window, the early winter, cold and dim twilight was spreading.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Jia Chen</p>
<p>I do not believe that there is anything in life that is worthy of praise or nostalgia. Except for the time of childhood when one is ignorant of everything, living the life of Adam and Eve in the primitive age. Once out of the paradise of childhood, and called an adult, one is also forever separated from the beautiful realm of the Garden of Eden, and even more forever separated from the enjoyment of happiness. On the one hand, one steps into the path of suffering, and from then on, one wanders and suffers on the path of suffering. Suffering all kinds of disasters and setbacks, bearing the burden of life, the millstone of life, year after year, day after day, letting that burden, letting that millstone press down, and everyone is pressed under the millstone, panting and struggling, until the ability to struggle disappears completely, so that one is no longer walking, but crawling, and then gradually bends the neck, hunches the back, and after a long time, perhaps from a strong person, becomes a pile of skin and bones like firewood, and from being completely like a person to being completely unlike a person, at this time, one is about to be finished.</p>
<p>But no matter who it is, they must stubbornly live on, even if they are stark naked, leaving only a bare body, they still cherish their worthless life infinitely, and live on, perhaps there is still a little hope. With this idea, even if they are starving every day and cannot make a living, they are still attached to life, unwilling to return. They would rather let the millstone of life pressing on their heads crush them so that they cannot move, and still refuse to let go, desperately supporting the millstone, struggling, falling down, then climbing up again, climbing up, and falling down again, and so on until they finally have no strength left. People are so full of the desire to live, what is it for? It is really incomprehensible. Often I see a kind of disabled person, whose limbs, which are the tools for earning a living, are incomplete, but they still turn their incomplete bodies and shout on the road, begging passers-by for a penny. Does such a person's life still have any interest and hope? I do not understand why they still insist on living in this way. I imagine that they would be much happier dead than alive, but they insist on living, and demand the same as ordinary people, which is too incomprehensible.</p>
<p>If it is said that the Creator has given you a life, you must naturally live, but how will you live? Is it just living by eating three meals a day and sleeping? Is it just living by a person being born, growing up, marrying, having children, growing old, and dying? If this is considered living, if this is considered life, then so-called life is fundamentally a bit ridiculous. However, most of those called people live in this way. And living like this, not living is not a big deal, and living is not a big deal either. Living a lifetime is the same as not living.</p>
<p>But the reason why everyone insists on living is probably because everyone holds half a hope for their own life, and there is a kind of beautiful longing growing in their hearts, calling them to sell their strength, and therefore they have a strong interest. So, it doesn't matter if the millstone of life crushes them until they are pale and emaciated, without a word of complaint, and without discouragement. However, what is considered a longing for life, or an ideal, does not really exist, and even if it does, it is as vague as a cloud in the sky. At best, it is nothing more than deceiving oneself, just to comfort oneself, and because of this, many people are willing to support the millstone, full of the idea that the days of being gilded will come later. Just keep thinking. Turning ordinary life into extraordinary. As if life will really be as grand as one thinks. In the end, the so-called longing is just a dream, and dreams will never bear fruit, or even turn into a pile of ashes, and nothing else is obtained. Only a few disappointments and emptiness are obtained. How can an ordinary life become extraordinary? In the end, it is still living a lifetime of incomprehensible life. It is still confused.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of that so-called longing for life that is not easy to come true, people all put on different faces, clownish, fierce, complicated like the painted faces on the stage. At the same time, they all use their minds, watching each other, taking advantage of a moment of carelessness, they kick you down, and step on top of you, watching each other in this way. Whoever has any loopholes, they will attack. And often in order to take advantage, they may as well put their conscience aside and let others suffer. At the same time, even if they are proud, those who step on others will eventually be stepped on by others. And in the end, the millstone of life on their own heads will also crush them so that they cannot breathe.</p>
<p>Is that what life is all about?</p>
<h3>Gray Zone</h3>
<p>— Sakura No</p>
<p>A child's wandering.</p>
<p>He did not know whether he lost his father after birth or his father died a day or a year before he was born; he did not see clearly what his mother's face looked like was kind and amiable, but when he just opened his eyes, it was when his mother closed her eyes 丨So, a lonely child was left to begin wandering.</p>
<p>He was half-lucky to receive the pity of a mother who had just lost her first son, and was accepted as this mother's son, and his body was kept warm and fed by this mother's milk.</p>
<p>The mother cared for him as if he were her own son, and took great care to look after the health of the surrogate child.</p>
<p>Slowly, the child grew up in the process 丨 Able to not drink milk, able to speak, and able to go alone from one village head to another village head and back again, without asking for directions and without making mistakes!</p>
<p>In the evening, he was able to easily feel that he was a lonely child without parents, but he would also sob privately out of gratitude for the cultivation and enthusiasm of this mother!</p>
<p>He was filial to this mother in direct proportion to the mother's care for this child, the love and concern of natural human relations!</p>
<p>One night, the mother fell ill, very seriously ill. Her face turned as pale as the waxed paper wrapping on cigarettes 丨</p>
<p>He rushed to invite Fang the doctor back, and the second time he saw his second mother's eyes closed tightly again, and he cried out loud!</p>
<p>His uncles and aunts rushed into the house and took all the belongings into custody.</p>
<p>He lost his nursing mother, and he lost his home.</p>
<p>After that, he began his second wandering.</p>
<p>He spent the night on the stone steps across the street with a large burlap sack.</p>
<p>The head was covered but the feet were not, and when he got up the next day, two feet had died!</p>
<p>His feet were so frozen and numb that he couldn't stand up, and he stumbled forward in a fall!</p>
<p>Wow! An extremely loud sound came from under his body, a girl of the same age, her face turning blue-purple, being crushed so that she couldn't breathe!</p>
<p>He took off his cotton coat and gave it to her to wear, cradled her head and neck and lay down in his arms, wrapping the burlap sack around his shoulders.</p>
<p>He rubbed the child's chest with his palms, and gradually a wisp of breath came out of her mouth.</p>
<p>He had found a confidante!</p>
<p>She was a lonely child without parents who had been driven out by her stepmother's lover.</p>
<p>They spent such a wandering life together!</p>
<p>One evening, it was so dark that they couldn't see anything, and they hadn't found a morning meal of pancakes.</p>
<p>Their stomachs were grumbling so loudly that they couldn't hold back, and they had no choice but to tighten their belts a little more. The flesh was so tight that it hurt!</p>
<p>The rice buckets of the bao fan makers were carried in front of them. Not caring about anything, they reached out and picked rice from the newspaper. Those makers rolled their eyes at them for a while, 丨Little beggars!</p>
<p>She complained that they shouldn't do such things, why should they be scolded as little beggars!</p>
<p>But her stomach was really hungry.</p>
<p>He let her eat first, but she refused to eat.</p>
<p>He cried and walked away.</p>
<p>When he came back, he saw that she was also crying terribly, and his heart ached even more!</p>
<p>The next day, he accompanied her back to her stepmother's house. He kowtowed desperately on the stone slabs several times, begging them to take in this poor child!</p>
<p>Under the sharp gaze of the neighbors on the left and right, the stepmother pulled her into the kitchen.</p>
<p>She saw him leaving the gate, and the tears couldn't stop flowing from her eyes.</p>
<p>He was wandering alone again!</p>
<p>One time, when he passed this gate again, that girl was dead!</p>
<p>He couldn't guess how she died?</p>
<p>God bless this child to be safe forever.</p>
<p>There were no tears in his eyes!</p>

<h3>Passion Flower</h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>(Plant Encyclopedia ··</p>
<p>"Passiflora, also known as Passion Flower, the petals are in the shape of a cross, symbolizing the passion of the Holy Christ on the cross, hence the name."</p>
<p>丨丨Passion on the cross!)</p>
<p>I left.</p>
<p>The night before I left, she sent me a small bunch of Passiflora, silvery white.</p>
<p>丨丨For the sake of life, is there anything worth being sentimental about? The whole world has to bow its head in the face of life. In this era, are there still no young men on the cross of life?</p>
<p>Pondering, feeling sentimental. And listening to her Croemi's voice...</p>
<p>丨丨The petals of the Passiflora symbolize the glorious passion of suffering in life; giving it to you, it symbolizes the glory of suffering in life, is it not good?</p>
<p>丨丨Good, thank you. Life may have its glorious passion of suffering, and that passion is glorious. Then you remember me like that.</p>
<p>丨丨Passion is glorious, I will remember you like that.</p>
<p>丨丨Thank you.</p>
<p>So, I left.</p>
<p>Leaving is for the sake of life, and also for the sake of my own youth; children in storms always like to use their youth as a weapon against the family, against society, against all unreasonableness.</p>
<p>The entire childhood was eroded in an old society like an ancient tomb, where there are rotten ancient corpses, frightening bones, and hardened soil that has accumulated into fossils... When one day, a wisp of withered soul awakens from the stratum, it feels unbearable suffocation, squirming... finally found an opportunity, left the ancient city of rotten corpses, left the declining home, without any sentimental tone, like the leaves in autumn, drifting to the vast world, one mile, and another mile.</p>
<p>One mile, and another mile, just wandering slowly, laughing, struggling; climbing the knife-like peaks in the morning, and diving into the explosive-like raging waves at night 丨丨丨 But it is said that this is also representative of the tragedy of life.</p>
<p>丨丨Is it really the tragedy of life? Doubted.</p>
<p>The one who answered me was her... "Yes."</p>
<p>I was shocked... She, I had known for a year; but could she also be a flower cultivated in the region?</p>
<p>But... a miracle, there was no mistake, she was also spending every tomorrow by sending away every today herself. In this way, we became friends on the life path like sparks.</p>
<p>We were friends; but, I found that she had something more than me, it is said, it was the passion on the cross of life.</p>
<p>Damn, are wanderers allowed to have passion?</p>
<p>But, the most damn thing is... I learned to be sentimental from her!</p>
<p>Cursing every day in front of the black sun... cursing her, cursing myself.</p>
<p>Spending a day into the night, the heart is like being twisted generally 丨丨All afraid, watching the days fly away one by one like the shadows of crows in the twilight, losing youth, maybe losing the weapon, losing the strength of life.</p>
<p>Thank God, I don't allow myself to live here anymore. In my heart, I only remember her sentence... "Throw yourself into life, wandering child, you must have the kind of passion that Saint Christ had on the cross."</p>
<p>So I left without a sound.</p>
<p>Carrying with me the bunch of Passiflora called passion flowers.</p>
<p>When the ship stopped at the pier, it was dusk. Hastily taking my things and walking ashore, looking at the Passiflora in the basket, it was withered.</p>
<p>Silently, I plucked off two white cross-shaped petals. Flattening them and clipping them in the pages of a book, I held the withered bouquet and waved it at the small river...</p>
<p>丨丨Passion and the cross, go to hell; in the face of life, even you have to give way.</p>
<p>Walking ashore, it was already dusk.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Divorce"</p>
<p>There are truly evil marital bonds in the world. Speaking of divorce, the heart aches. They have differing opinions and cannot live together. It's better than constantly bickering on the pillow. Some have secretly made new vows, forming a separate pair of lovebirds. Some are rebuilding their love nests, attracting phoenixes to gather. Some abandon the old to love the new, willingly becoming unfaithful. Some remarry, finding it difficult to conceal it from their original wives. Therefore, everyone has to negotiate. First, explain in detail the separation of the pair. Feelings of sorrow. Endless hatred. It's like seven provinces' steel knives piercing the heart. They arrange to hire lawyers and pay fees together. The beautiful flower branch will never reunite. Some shake hands and kiss affectionately before leaving. Some have children pulling at their clothes, tears never drying. Some angrily turn their heads, willingly parting forever. Some hypocritically still want to make amorous advances. Let's see how they each seek a partner to share dreams. I'm afraid they will still encounter the same problems sooner or later. Strangers, do not linger with the love. Holding the pipa again, hatred hangs heavy. Just end this fleeting marriage with a single stroke.</p>

<p>Modern customs are changing anew. The prosperity of Shanghai is most famous. Shanghai misses are very blessed. They have cultivated for several lifetimes to learn to be modern. She is born into a famous family, spoiled and accustomed to luxury. Hundreds of servants attend to her every whim. From a young age, she studies at patriotic schools. She excels in dancing and singing. She is elegantly chosen as the queen. Attracting the admiration of young men. She fully absorbs the new knowledge of the 24th century. Men and women interact intimately. She speaks perfect English fluently. She vividly acts like a goddess, pretending to be real. Her whole body is strangely adorned. Tall and graceful, her appearance is captivating. The barbers are truly skilled. Her permed hair resembles willow branches. Her cherry-like mouth has a dot of red. French lipstick is most welcome. Her eyebrows are curved like a new moon. Her eyes ripple with gentle affection, and her posture is light. Her fragrant cheeks often add a touch of whiteness. Mystical beauty keeps her youthful. Her spring flower-like fingers are as white as jade. Her fingernails are dyed with henna, quite fashionable. Her powder-covered neck is truly stylish. Her breasts are exposed, revealing new powder. Her cheongsam is narrow and tight around her body. Her fragrant sweat drenches her like wontons. Her short trousers and long stockings are worn even on hot days, not fearing mosquito bites. Who can match this kind of blessing? Excessive indulgence and extravagance are inappropriate. (We most hope) that she eats frugally, dreams and wakes up quickly.</p>
