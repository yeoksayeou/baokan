<h3>禁止學生跳舞</h3>
<p>季</p>
<p>兩月以來。滬上人士頗多主張禁止學生跳舞。大學聯合會創議於前孔祥熙王正廷等諸名流聲援於後。不惟大學敎職員中有組織自勵會以期收風行草偃之效者。卽首當其衝之各大學學生。亦有「大學生復興運動促進會」之組織。該會宣言。對於大學生之出入舞塲一事。雖有所辨白。而於禁舞之原則。仍表贊同。日前市敎育當局。復有進一步之措施。卽呈請市府函商第一二特區租界當局。飭在物區内各跳舞塲不准招待學生跳舞。並由二特區工部公董各局派員。會同敎育局所派人員。至各舞塲實地調查禁止。一經查出將卽通知所在學校。開除學籍。並不准轉學云云。足見禁止発陈生跳舞一舉。過去尙未顯著成效。故欲再接再厲。力挽社會之頽風也。</p>
<p>學生在求學時代。輕入舞塲。耳聽淫糜之樂。目接妖冶之色。不特荒廢學業。抑且有損德性。結果。則在生理爲早熟。在知識爲幼稚。縱能勉强卒業。亦何足以安身立命。更不必云任重致遠。夫一國當承平之日。人民生活若皆流於放僻邪侈。尙足反盛而爲衰。而况値此國難嚴重民族垂危之秋。莘莘學子沉湎於歌塲舞榭。而不知刻苦自勵。更令人心痛無旣。此其不應加以寬容放任。誠爲天經地義。在原則上實無可稍加非難者也。</p>
<p>今國内舞塲之衆多。舞風之流行。可推滬市爲最。一般靑年置身於不良環境之内。最易迷惑本性。越出常規。卽以大學生言。安分守己者固多。而心慕舞塲中燈紅酒綠。或見獵心喜。躍欲試者。恐亦不在少數。雖曰補救之方。應從事於充實學校内容。提倡正當娛樂游藝。與乎加緊　課程。注重訓育。甚至限制學生經濟。而按諸事實。仍多難行。揚湯止沸。不如釜底抽薪。與其單獨責成學校與學生。不如兼在舞塲中實地制止之奏效爲更速也。此次市敎育局提議派員查禁事屬草創。一時雖未易普遍。但可懲一警百。使諸好舞生徒。有所戒懼。此種措施。如能得特區合作。行之以恒則造福於全滬學生者。殊非淺鮮也。　　滬上著名舞　塲。多設於租界。非吾市政當局權力所能及。今後誠欲查禁靑年學生跳舞。自須得租界行政機關之共同贊助。吾人且深覺租界工部局公莉局亦有其義不容辭者在也。考滬上跳舞之風。雖由歐傳來。而歐美各國對於靑年學生之出入舞塲。則類皆懸爲厲禁。並令舞塲拒絕招待學生。年來日本舞風。亦甚流行。至本年八月間。其警視廳亦下令禁止學生入舞塲與咖啡館矣。其用意無非在預防靑年實際生活上之惡影響耳。今爲滬上租界中之居民者。不論中外。同負納稅之義務。而吾華人之納稅尤多。租界當局縱一時不及廣設各級學校。以薫陶吾國居民之子女。亦何可坐視其　入歧途而不一糾正之乎。吾人甚望其能樂於贊同吾滬市當局之要求也。</p>

<h3>潮汕土糖慘受壓抑</h3>
<p>省政府經售國糖</p>
<p>與農民土糖競銷</p>
<p>汕頭通信、廣東省政府國貨推銷處、因推銷其經營之五羊牌國糖、前曾藉口復興土糖、施行糖業統制、對於各屬土糖、諸多留難、最近該處又頒發土糖運銷暫行辦法三項、取締土糖運銷、凡土糖運銷須經國貨分銷處查騐、領取許可證、方准運銷、並經於本月一日實行、普寗·潮陽·旅汕同鄕會、以國貨推銷處、跡近摧殘國貨、首先致電省政府、請求取銷、旅滬潮州同鄕會、亦有電到粵、略謂土糖運銷查騐領證辦法、本爲防範私運攙雜洋糖起見、惟土糖價賤、洋糖價貴、人雖至愚、必不出此、且土糖出口、必須潮海關檢騐、及抵他埠、又經海關複查、辦法已經周詳、今以運輸經過、驟加飿照手續、徒滋騷擾、無裨實益、我潮土糖、純由鄕村農民、零星製造、勤耕終年、胼手胝足、數口之家、恃此爲活、若檢騐手續繁苛、必致運輸阻梗、週轉不靈、生活益困、當此農村破產、生綫全此是賴、似此苛擾阻抑、立見農輟商停、名曰保護、無異摧殘、迫得籲請鈞座、飭將土糖出廠檢騐暫行辦法取銷云云、按潮屬土糖、建設廳前曾令各縣調查、據潮安苗圃農林専員報告、植蔗時間、自春間二月開始、至十二月可收成、每一種戶、如蔗苗·肥料·人工·田租·錢糧·田畝捐·及因田地而負担之區鄕公所經費·警衛費·自治費·收割人工·運工·應納糖寮榨汁費·糖寮捐等、每一畝田、自栽種而至熬糖、須成本大洋二十八元、農民平日須向富農及糖商借貸、以應購辦肥料及攤派公欵、至糖出賣後歸還、或用糖抵回利息、各農民在農田附近、組織古式糖寮、至榨汁熬糖畢卽拆寮、各糖存於農人家中、潮汕糖商、至此乃派人下鄕看貨色購買、收集後、運到汕頭洋棧内裝包、然後轉運往長江内地各省販賣、以上爲政府人員之報告、可見農民製糖之苦况矣、</p>
<p>目下省政府取締土糖辦法、產銷兩方面、均認爲有三點難行、（一）土糖無論多少、從内地起運時、必須向國貨公倉、領取隨貨執照之許可證、稽查沿途騐照放行、（二）土糖到汕時、如要出口、須將貨樣用紙包好、用玻璃瓶封固、編列號碼、交農林局化騐、有無攙入雜質洋糖、（三）土糖出口、須有運貨時之許可證、公倉之騐放證、方得報關配輪、並定罰則甚嚴、此項取締辦法實行後、農民無不呌苦、况稽查員到處騷擾、政府明知之然亦默許之、如國貨推銷處覆潮安縣政府函、足爲政府方面之供詞也、函云、一查糖業統制、原爲復興土糖、堵塞漏巵、以圖挽救農村經濟之破產而設、故統制祇限於機器製造之白糖、（潮屬無此糖）其民營之土製黃糖、在各製造地方、原可自由買賣、並不干涉、惟推銷外屬、僅施於手續上之檢騐、以期防止攙冒、現在並無統制之明文、乃查各近屬銷商、藉統制之名、對於土糖運銷、諸多留難、藉端勒索、對於土糖零沽店、違背定章、勒收證費、（卽檢查證每張要納欵若干）遂令民營糖商、及售賣土糖商戶、對於製造運銷、滋生疑懼、似此情形、無異助長洋糖之私運、摧殘土糖之生機、實與政府發展要省糖業之原意、背道而馳、殊堪痛恨、亟應嚴行禁止、以杜弊端」云云、國貨推銷處所言固如是、但未見其實行踐之耳、</p>
<p>查潮屬各縣、原爲土糖出產最富之區、除運銷本省内地各縣外、每年從海道運往長江各省行銷數量、約二百餘萬担、（每担一百斤）但其後受渣華白糖之打擊、逐年减少、自洋糖加稅、潮屬農村種蔗者復活、每畝蔗園、豐年可產四担、旱年亦有二三担、每担市面售價爲十二三元、零售每斤一角半、但土糖旺銷、實予國貨推銷處之五羊牌國糖以重大威脅、因此又爲國糖所忌、至國糖推銷方法、係在汕頭設立國糖第二公倉、各縣向國貨推銷處承銷、每縣每月銷五百包至二三千包不等、須銷足額數、多銷多得回佣、每包足一百斤、二十四號白糖、每百斤香港時價四元八角之貨色、國貨推銷處承商、在潮汕賣毫洋二十一元、另附加運費四毫、稽查費五角、承商又自行僱用稽查員多人、以爲壓抑土糖之工具、又潮安承銷、批發價値每百斤大洋二十一元五角、澄海承商、則將該貨専賣給在城内某三家商號、由彼三商任意壟斷、高抬時價、同時用稽查員之力、壓迫其他土糖商、以上皆公開事實、國貨推銷處函中、已慨乎言之、人民亦無可如之何也、</p>
<p>建設廳預備在揭陽曲溪設立製糖廠、收買民間之蔗製糖、將來土糖原料缺乏、農民無法自存、實勢使然、現新土糖已屆上市之期、以前潮安國糖承商、每日可售國糖一百包者、今因受土糖打擊、每日平均售不足六十包、因此土糖大受壓抑、扶植國糖推銷、其實所謂國糖者、卽洋糖之變相、特由政府國貨推銷處經營、遂曲稱爲國糖、大槪國糖代表政府之抻益、土糖代表農村之利益、成爲矛盾性、照目下土糖被抑情勢以觀、土糖銷滅之期、當在不遠、亦可慨矣、</p>

<h3>李馥蓀氏重農說之再進一解</h3>
<p>穆·藕·初·</p>
<p>者、中國銀行總經理張嘉滶氏主以人才經濟、開發内地、最近浙江實業銀行總經理李馥蓀氏、又有重農之說、滬上兩大銀行家、均注意於内地經濟及農業之發展、不僅爲滬上金融界之先導、且爲全國經濟復興之幸事、申報十二月十五日社論「廣李馥蓀氏之重農說、」主張第一應求農村秩序之安靖、第二爲農村金融之調劑、第三則爲交通與運輸之便利、而於苛捐雜稅一項、因中央嚴令各省正在整理、未加論列、申報所舉三點、果爲復興農村之先决條件、然而農事本身應如何建設、關係重農之說尤鉅、愚願陳其一得、藉供留心農村問題者之採納、</p>
<p>遜清末葉、重農之說早有所聞、自鼎革以還、農業設専部者亦已二十餘年、於此三四十年間、重農之呼聲隨起隨伏、然而近年以來、進口之農產物、如民食所需之米麥不僅未見少减、抑且年有增加、農村經濟之破碎零落、已至不堪收拾之程度、此其故何在、蓋徒托空言、而不務實際是也、國家雖設有農業専部·學校·農塲·於改良農事振興農業之文章、亦日接觸於吾人之眼簾、而於脚踏實地躬赴農村從事改革者、實爲罕見、故三四十年來、重農之呼聲、徒見諸行政要員之談片、報館時人之言論、而未收絲毫之效果、其原因蓋在此、故欲致農業於振興之道、道宜少發空言、實事求是、此其一也、</p>
<p>種瓜得瓜、種豆得豆、凡農產品質之良窳、產量之我寡、非空言所能搪塞、故農政之設施、農校之訓練、農塲之傳播、苟非得人、則不但無良好之效果、抑且爲有識者及老農所竊笑、况農業専務、分析甚細、種麥者不宜從事於稻作、牧畜者不宜從事於森林、雖同爲農業之範圍而不相混淆有如此者、我國以前農塲五榖雜種、六畜兼收、而期成效毫無、故今後欲辦理農業、應羅致専門之人才、有専才宜於某省某縣或農業中某種細巨者、則設立農塲以供其試騐傳播、並由其主持、此其二也、</p>
<p>各地氣候不同、故有棉帶麥帶之分、森林畜牧亦莫不如之、故主持農村宜求統盤籌劃、將全國可耕可墾之地、分爲若干區域、制定植物畜牧之具體計劃、從事設施、不但人才經濟均可節省、而收效亦宏、最近陳公博氏設中央農業實騐所於首都中山門外之孝陵衛、闢地數千　畝、廣集全國農業専家、分工研究、數年來之計劃、一旦見之實行、良可欽佩、故重農之第三要點、乃在於統盤籌劃、</p>
<p>英國洛頓斯坦特農事研究所、迄今已一百二十餘年、美國之農事試騐塲、垂六七十年者亦甚多、蓋農業爲科學之専門學問、近世科學之昌明、其特質進步、有日新月異之槪、稼穡之事豈能例外、蘇聯大植物學家米楚林氏、以八旬老翁、積六十年之試騐研究、乃發明新植物種三百餘種、足見農業研究、非一旦一夕所能生效、而農政之施設、亦在於能恒久如一、此其四也、上述四項、一一見諸實行、農村即有復蘇之望乎、然而未也、蓋農產增加、挹注合度、果能自給自足、然而如今日各國關稅之壁壘森嚴、農產物之競賣傾銷、苟遇豐年、農產價格低落、則農民仍無以爲生、故本國之工業不振、即使農產豐收、仍難得其實效、蘇聯本爲一農業國、近年來經濟日趨繁榮、所以爲世界各國所不及者、蓋以其農業工業化、以工業之興旺、而輔助農業之發展、由是而農業益繁榮、相得益彰、農工俱興、則商務繁盛、國力充實、國民經濟亦因之而充裕矣、故重農亦宜兼及於重工、</p>
<p>我國農民散佈全國、占全國人口之最大多數、因迫於經濟拙於知能、處處居於被動地位、有水旱天災而不能避、遇苛捐雜稅而莫敢言、近年以來、益以世界農業恐慌之影響、致農民痛苦日益加甚、輾轉塡於溝壑之中而無地訴苦、尙不若工商各界之尙能婉轉呼籲也、我國本以農立國、而農民这苦痛如此、寗非痛事、故今日欲拯救農村、尤須修明内政、苟政治導入正軌、則農業自能振興矣、</p>

<h3>兒童年的希望</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>現在，今年快要過去了！那國定爲兒童年的明年，又要開始了！小朋友們對於這兒童年當然要有番振作，使它甩爲榮譽的兒童年。但是小朋支們應該怎樣來進行呢？現在我來貢獻一點意見。</p>
<p>第一點：就是希小朋友們能够提倡國貨，因爲明年不但是兒童年；也是學生國貨年；凡是中國人，都應該服用國貨。所以今年我們要脚踏實地的去做，並且要從你們個人，和你們家庭做起。</p>
<p>第二點：你們要上緊讀書，因爲「救國必須讀書，讀書即是救國」。小朋友們要明瞭這種意義，决不可藉口救國而荒廢讀書。</p>
<p>第三點：是要實行新生活，尤其是要注意清潔和儉樸。對於衣服上面，祇須布衣布服，穿得齊齊整整；乾乾凈凈；又何必穿綢着緞？</p>
<p>兒童年已將臨頭了，我希望你們作一個兒童年中的好兒童。</p>
<h3>小先生</h3>
<p>— 希旦</p>
<p>小朋友們丨你們可知道小先生是誰呢？他們就是河北省定縣平民敎育實騐區裏學校裏的學生。因爲我們中國不識字的人太多了，所以，河北省定縣平民敎育實騐區、就呌學校裏的學生，去做「不識字村民」的先生，在修學閒空時間，去指導不識字的村民識字。那輩小先生年齡雖小，但他們都能勤於服務，誠懇不倦地去敎村民識字，替定縣平民敎育的推廣上，已做了很多的好成績，現在還在積極的推進中。</p>
<p>小朋友：你們聽了上面的一件事實，怎麽樣呀？我對你們講；這種敎育，確爲今日救國的重要工作，我們殊大可參贊其成，所以我們要仿小先生的方法，呌我們分往鄕村中敎導一般失學的孩子，敎他們識字，這確是負有偉大的使命，但這裏並眞要呌你們向不認識的人，去敎他識字，同時到很遠的路，去敎他瘊識字。祇要我們的親戚或朋友、而他們是没有受過敎主育，或者受過很淺薄的敎育，那末，我們可實行這種種有益的工作，這豈不是很好的辦法嗎？最後，極盼望小朋友們能見諸實行。</p>
<h3>勸用功歌</h3>
<p>— 戴濟民</p>
<p>勸用功，勸用功，男兒勤學是英雄。世間有事皆當做，天下無堅不可攻，努力邁進兮無窮，學圃茫茫兮海闊天空，拳拳相勉兮勸君用功。</p>
<p>勸用功，勸用功，勸君莫只恁從容。養成惡習皆因懶，虚度光陰只爲慵，努力前進兮可風，前程渺渺兮希望無窮，拳拳相勉兮勸君用功。</p>
<p>勸用功，勸用功，爲師不過發君蒙。十分學問由師授，百倍功夫自己攻，努力前進兮耀榮，學問充實兮豁然貫通，拳拳相勉兮勸君用功。</p>
<h3>早起</h3>
<p>— 冰英</p>
<p>時候已是冬天了，北風吹上臉來大家都喊道：「冷喲！冷喲！」有錢的小朋友這時都穿着媽媽或姊姊結的　繩衫，没有錢的小朋友也都由親愛的媽媽加穿着棉襖了，</p>
<p>每一個人都喜歡睡在溫暖的被窩裏，小朋友也常常躱在被窩裏不肯起身；現在，學校裏已有許多小朋友要常常遲到了，遲到，祇有不想上進的小朋友才肯遲到喲！遲到是一個最可恥的名詞！</p>
<p>早晨，空氣很新鮮，我們在早上運動對於身體是很有益的，所以早起的人都很健康，早晨，我們的頭腦很清楚，讀書最容易記憶，所以早起的小朋友的成績都很優良，是晨，太陽在東方升起，雲霞燦爛，小鳥在枝頭歌唱，音樂美妙，所以早起的人都很愉快。「一日之計在於晨，」早晨是一天最主要的時候，我們是萬萬不能浪費的！</p>
<p>小朋友，我們要早起，我們要在早上運動，我們要在早上讀書，不要留戀在被窩裏把這寳貴的早晨空度；我們知道每一個勤懇的小朋友都是很早就起身的，我們知道每一個健康的小朋友都在很早就起身的，小朋友，我們大家早起，祇有懶貓才在早晨還躱在被窩裏。</p>
<h3>賣糖的童子</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>我每天都從愛文義路麥特赫司脫路轉角走到校裏去，也每天都從愛文義路麥特赫司脫路轉角走回家裏來。</p>
<p>就在那轉角的矮墻下面，有一個賣糖的童子席地坐着。一天來回要看到四趟，除了天陰下雨，他是刻板的坐在那裏的。</p>
<p>他賣的是芝蔴糖，一隻　絲籃，放在面前地上，有攤平的，有疊起的。有時候他悠悠地喊着：</p>
<p>阿要買芝蔴糖，三個銅板一條，三個銅板一條！</p>
<p>有時候他不響，只默默地，潛心地看着書。賣糖的童子而能够看書，而能够這樣有恒心地看書，這在别處我是不曾看到的。</p>
<p>他看的是什麽書？我没有看清楚，同時來去匆匆，也不曾有時間去問過他。</p>
<p>社會上，失學的兒童是到處是，像那賣糖的童子的用功不輟，却也並不多覯。我寫這篇文字的動機，便是要望許多小朋友都學那賣糖童子的榜樣，把讀書的興趣提高起來！</p>
<h3>約束</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>兒童科學講座行</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>我們生活上所需要的另外一種是「行」的問題。行的首要事件是「路」（圖一）没有路，人就没有方法可以走。就是有了行的工具，（車）也没有方法解决。路有了，就可以使用行的工具。在都會裏，陸路上大槪都用車子來代步了。車子的種類很多，（圖二）遠路的還可以用火車。人類的進步，一切依着需要而發明。陸路上行的問題解决了，水路上也跟着陸路而進步，船的發明以至進步到汽船，（圖三）還是多麽偉大的功績呢，我們只就路的改良，船車的進步上說，這行的問題，已經表現了人類的智慧。</p>
<p>從樹林中開闢出道路來，已經是發明事項中的偉大者，因爲泥路的泥滑，不平，石路的高低易於破碎，再進一小用砂石水泥柏油而築成大路，使我們行走舒適，接着覺得行路的疲勞，於是由獨輪車而發明牲畜拉車，人類生活上已經舒適到極點；然而快慢的關係，於是用人力車，脚踏車，以至電車汽車火車，我們的祖先，眞是夢裏也想不到，生活的進步，竟達到了最高層。</p>
<p>就水路說，獨木船渡河，已經是給人們極大便利，現在竟能用電力，蒸汽力，每小時的速度，由半里以增加到幾百里，可嘗是初民生活時會想得到呢？</p>
<p>但是，小朋友！我們現在是在享受前人遺傳下來的幸福，我們遺傳些什麽給後人呢？</p>
<h3>怎樣注意冬天的衛生？</h3>
<p>— 菱湖昭</p>
<p>小朋友，冬夏兩季是最要當心的。夏天的流行病是痧霍亂，及吐瀉等，而冬天的便是傷風，咳嗽等。看看很像是不足介懷的小毛病，其實感受了它，却也很不舒服的。並且有擴大到不可醫治的危險哩。</p>
<p>小朋友，我們與其一小心而感受了毛病，求醫，吃苦湯：我們還不是預先來注意一下爲妙。左面幾項是冬天的衛生方法：</p>
<p>（一）我們從熱的地方跑出來，不可使身體就遇到冷，否則容易傷風。</p>
<p>（二）嚴寒的天氣，應該少開窗門，以避寒風。</p>
<p>（三）天明卽起，步行於空氣新鮮的地方，向太陽作數分鐘的呼吸運動。</p>
<p>（四）口喝時，最好飲清潔的沸水，不必用茶葉。</p>
<p>（五）家中若有人患傷風，那末對於飯碗，茶杯及筷子等，都宜分别，以防傳染的危險。</p>
<p>（六）冬天多運動，能够鍜鍊身體，使皮膚增進抵抗力。（運動後切不可受冷，否則要患重傷風的。）</p>
<h3>黃金從那裏來的</h3>
<p>— 丁合</p>
<p>黃金！我們都知道的，我們爸爸媽媽手指上戴的黃色戒子，那是用黃金做成的。但是黃金從那裏來的。我們都不知道。</p>
<p>現在我來說給你聽：黃金都從礦裏開採出來，當時開採出的，還不是純金，和别的金屬物混和在一起，呌做礦苗，雖然有時開出也會是純金，但是極稀有的。</p>
<p>我們把礦苗製成純金的方法有兩種，第一種，用藥水把礦苗或金砂溶解成液體，再放别的藥品進去，使純金沉澱，也有用電器，把純金分解出來。第二種，將礦苗或金砂用强熱煆煉熔化，再加别種物質使純金和雜質，各各化合。純金就是做首飾的黃金。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我們要想起我國產金的地方，像承德，山東的桂山，四川的灌縣，安縣，都是產金的地方，但是我們很少去開採，不是很可惜麽？</p>
<h3>穩健和僥倖</h3>
<p>— 章南邨</p>
<p>有用糖轉彩的担子，停歇在馬路旁邊，担子上，懸掛着糖做的人物鳥獸，並且加着紅綠的色彩，很容易惹起小朋友注意，因此就有許多小朋友，在這糖担四週，包圍着瞧。</p>
<p>挑糖担的人，將他的小檯子上面一根木棒，手提着轉了一轉，口裏發出悠揚的高聲，唱着：「一隻銅板來轉彩······」唱了多時，許多不朋友没有什麽表示。</p>
<p>海兒看見一個糖獅子好玩，就把糖獅子照値買去，海兒的朋友呌貪兒，說：你上當了，若是出銅板一隻，能轉着得彩，是多麽便宜，何必出多的錢去買呢？</p>
<p>貪兒看重了一個糖羅漢，就拿出一個銅板壓在糖羅漢那　類上，希望轉着得彩，於是一次兩次······直到十餘次，都轉不着，他小袋裏，媽媽給與他買點心吃的錢，都一齊跑到挑糖担人的腰中去了。</p>
<p>貪兒又氣又急，不由口裏說：眞不幸得很，糖羅漢没得着，點心錢又去了，是不能將這事告訴媽媽的，只好不吃點心來挨餓，說時現出非常苦惱的樣子。</p>
<p>海兒安慰地說：僥倖是失敗的根苗，我因爲記行了這句話，所以抱穩健主義，寗願出鉽賣，不肯圖便宜去轉着嘗試以希望僥倖，他們這一類轉彩東西，都是欺騙和引誘的，從今以後，我們不睬他，他總不會拉着我們上當。</p>
<p>海兒袋裏，還剩着有錢，請貪兒吃了點心，貪兒很感激海兒，此後他兩人遇到馬路上摸彩一類的担子，就像遇到毒蛇猛獸一般，急心避開，連看都不敢看。</p>
<h3>空氣壓扁洋鐵罐</h3>
<p>— 敬安</p>
<p>小朋友們丨這是一個很有趣媓實騐，祇要臉盆一隻，盛着冷水，一個兩端封閉的罐頭，還要木塞。</p>
<p>先把罐頂中間開一小圓孔，灌進了四分之一的水。舉火燒開，使其沸騰，卽用木塞緊緊封口，（若不緊時，或擦上火漆及其他可封口的東西）。投入冷水裏面，要過了五六分鐘的光景，就刮擦一聲，這洋鐵罐忽然壓扁掉了。</p>
<p>這種理由，因爲鐵罐的裏面，只有四分之一的水，被火燒沸騰後，水蒸汽將罐内所有的空氣，完全驅逐凈盡了。上面封了罐口，僅有滿滿的水蒸氣在裏面。把它投進臉盆冷水裏，大約在五六分鐘上下的時間，那水蒸汽受了冷，就完全變成冷水了。洋鐵罐卽成了眞空，我們知道空氣的壓力是很大的，每平方時的面積約有十五磅的壓力。罐冷了，裏面除了少許水外，什麽東西都没有，受着大氣的壓力，便刮擦一聲壓得一團糟。這罐體之所以壓扁的緣故，原來就是因爲外面大量空氣的壓力。</p>
<p>小智囊</p>
<h3>五碗水</h3>
<p>— 顏鑫泉</p>
<p>申先生手裏捧着五隻碗，一一放到桌上；又舀了一盆水來，都平均倒在五個碗裏。隨手拿出紙筆，把每碗水都假定一個溫度。假定的數目第一碗是十七度，第二碗是二十一度，第三碗是三十四度，第四碗是四十二度，第五碗是五十一度；對着春哥，夏姊，秋弟，冬妹，說：我現在請問你們丨那一碗水和那一碗水互相拼掉，或者有其他更簡捷的方法，能使這五碗水的溫度平均？</p>
<p>春哥，夏姊，秋弟，冬妹，都用必想着；想了十多分鐘，都想不出，祗得請敎申先生告訴他們。申先生說：「這方法是容易得很哪丨祇須把這五碗溫度不同的水，一说傾到盆裏，攪匀了，再舀到碗裏來，那麽五碗水的溫度，不是平均了嗎？」</p>
<p>四位小朋友聽了都拍着手說：「啊！不錯，不錯。」</p>
<h3>兒童科學遊戲紙鍋烹蛋</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>小朋友們！你在學校裏，功課忙碌嗎？我想：現在對於自然界的一切景物，没有什麽可以觀賞，這不是很沈悶的嗎？雖是功課忙碌，難道抽不出一二小時的工夫？來做這很奇怪的科學的游戲，並且，特蛋煮熟，又可以自己吃吃，究竟熟不熟，更可以增進你許多物理上的學理，我們何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>試騐的方法，異常簡單，人人可以做的，祗要用鉛畫紙製成鍋形，繫在三脚架上，注水鍋中，並入鷄蛋一枚，下面用酒精燈燃燒，數分鐘後，水就沸騰而蛋熟了。喂！小朋支！你覺得希奇嗎？用火燒紙，紙不是要燒掉嗎？不，不，不是這樣的，這是物理上的學理，讓我來告訴它的理由吧！</p>
<p>我們平常所用的鍋子，是用鐵製的，因爲凡是金屬，火不易燃着，什麽緣故？爲了金屬易於傳熱，一處燃着，就散於全體。木製的却相反，所以木質纖維所造的紙是不能用的，那末，這裏用紙鍋煮蛋熟而使紙不燒燬，究爲甚麽緣故呢？因爲要使一物燃燒，必要被那物攝取熱量，但現在要使紙鍋燒燬，必先被鍋中之物攝取大部分的熱量，餘下的不足以使紙鍋燒掉。你看：我們用紙浸濕，投入火中，非要把水蒸發盡，不能使紙燒着。紙鍋所以能煮熟蛋，而不燒燬，就是這個道理。</p>
<p>小朋友！你在這個星期日，把游玩的時間，來做這科學的遊戲，一面可以長進科學上的常識，一面又可練習你的科學上實騐的手腕，這樣子，你一定能够得到許多利益和興趣，這是非要作親自實騐不可的，所以我希望你瘊趕快實騐吧！</p>

<h3>被壓迫者中的漢奸</h3>
<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>丨丨天津小姐陳湘君與婢女蓮喜丨丨</p>
<p>婦女們是最典型的被壓迫和被剥削者。家庭婦女，更可當作整個社會的被壓迫者的縮影看。家庭裏有統治者，掠奪者，享樂者，也有被統治，被掠奪的受難者。婦女們丨丨從主婦到傭婢，是屬於後一類的。</p>
<p>現今，我們可以這樣說：在經濟的和男子的從屬之下，婦女們無例外的都是被壓迫者。</p>
<p>不過話雖如此說，一般中可還有特殊。被壓迫者也常常會又是壓迫者。這些人，從她寄生蟲的身份上分潤着一些掠奪者的贓物，於是她把敵人忘了，自己站的什麽地位也忘了。不但如此，她效學着她的敵人，在同伴們身上施行一種壓迫與榨取。敵人變了她的同伴，而同伴成了她的敵人。對敵人没有絲毫愾，對同伴没有絲毫同情，成爲敵人最兇惡的帮手和爪牙。這種人，說比敵人更來得可惡，槪也並不過分。</p>
<p>婆婆壓迫媳婦，主婦蹂躪傭婢等等事件，我們就這樣看法。</p>
<p>十三日報上，登載着天津小姐陳湘君及其母陳許氏虐待婢女的新聞，事情是這樣的：七歲婢女蓮喜，平常在「黑屋」裏「舖蔴袋」「睡地板」，吃「剩飯」，還要「不知道因什麽」的天天被毒打，被火筷打屁股，被烟捲燒頭，被骨針扎臉。</p>
<p>我們看到這新聞，雖然不免很受到刺激，但頭腦冷靜一點時，便又覺得實在用不到大驚小怪。這樣的事情，實際上才多着呢！這只是九牛的一毛。無論什麽時空，都有這種事情在發生。婢女傭僕等是被壓迫者的最下一層，他們受壓迫者壓迫，還常常不免要受比他們上幾層的被壓迫者中的「漢奸」們所壓迫丨現在這種剥削的體制存在一天，這類事情非但不會發生，連呌他少「發生」一點也是不可能的。</p>
<p>不過這新聞中，有一段問答很使我感到興趣：推事問：「是不是因爲你淘氣打你的？」蓮喜答：「我不淘氣。因爲我到隣居黃老頭家去、陳許氏就去打我，有黃老頭反我拉着。以後就由黃老頭把我送回去，陳湘君堵住我的嘴，把我按倒，陳許氏用籘桿打我。」絃外之音，似乎蓮喜要是淘氣的話，她被打就是活該。可見一個雇用婢女的人，雇用婢女不用說是合法的，婢女淘氣凹打她，也還可以原諒。法律所要制裁的，只是婢女不淘氣丨丨說開一點，不違背主子意志。丨丨而被打。但是我們的看法，又似乎不同，我們覺得，一個人就根本没有應該剥削他人勞力的理由。雇用婢女，就該受法律制裁。</p>
<p>推事和蓮喜的對話中還有値得我們注意的地方。推事問：陳許氏每天作什麽？』蓮喜供：『十二點才起來，洗完臉她仍躺着睡覺……』問：『你每天全作什麽？』答：『第天早晨七點起床，掃地擦桌子，生爐子。等陳許氏吃完飯睡覺以後，我才吃飯。吃她剩的。』問：『陳瑞章（卽陳湘君）是作什麽的？』供：「他是學戲唱戲的。」問：『陳許氏呢？』供：『是呌陳瑞章學戲的。』我們都看到了吧，壓迫者的生活中那麽腐化與享福丨而被壓迫者的是那麽勞苦與悽慘1因此壓迫者實在才是應當被壓迫的，而被壓迫者才是應當去壓迫這些惡魔的！</p>
<h3>「社會人」自述</h3>
<p>— 先</p>
<p>丨娜拉出走後在社會的一角丨</p>
<p>婦女園地的編者知道我已在社會上混過幾年的，所以出這個題目，要我把我的經過寫一寫。起初，我覺得很困難，因爲我旣不長於虚構的寫法，若老老實實地寫出來，未免不大漂亮。但仔細一想：這些經過，都是社會上的現象；公開這些現象，作爲研究婦女問題的對象，正是我們每一個婦女的應盡之義務。</p>
<p>當我還在學校裏上課的時候，那時候是在天國裏丨丨孩子們的天國裏。從未想到過什麽家庭，社會，這些天國以外的事。同時我的母親死得太早，家庭没有給我多大印象。</p>
<p>從十歲起，我一直住在學校裏。學校是與家庭隔　的，又和社會不連絡，所以就成爲雲端的天國。我住在天國一十二年，因爲家裏經濟困難，迫着我走進社會去。此時，我年紀纔過二十，翅膀不硬，羽毛不豐，怯生生不敢走進那陌生的社會。也不想到家庭去。我希望頂好自己能够再走進天國，或者有一個人來帮助我。誰料就此被社會騙去關在家庭裏了。</p>
<p>旣是不甘心關在家庭裏的，怎樣服侍丈夫，逢迎翁姑，扶持兒女，等等關於家庭的事，我是不甘心做，不能做，簡直不會做。同時，他是一個没有職業，尙未成名的著作者，我們的生活非常艱苦。爲想要分担這家庭經濟的責任，而减少丈夫的痛苦，我常常想走進社會去。可是没有人來同情我，帮助我。</p>
<p>哭泣，怨恨，仇怒，一切不能毀滅我要「獨立生活，「自由生活」的願望！那「吃人的飯，服人所管」的没理由要服從的生活，我也是無論如何不甘心再過下去了。在這些個當兒，我感謝一位姊妹，她解放了我。於是我終於走進了社會。</p>
<p>最初我在湖南的故鄕敎書，因爲離婚的關係，無端地被環境丨丨社會的侮辱，輕蔑。我不堪於蹂躪，便由故鄕逃到北平。</p>
<p>在北平住在一個親戚的家裏，等待工作。大槪總是我的不是吧，才三四天就惹起親戚太太的吃飛錯，無情地侮辱。實際上我一點也没有愛過她的老爺，而她以爲我丨丨離婚婦丨丨是生成給人家踐踏的。報喜不久我就到Ｔ地的一個報館裏當校對去了。</p>
<p>從這時候算起，才是我正式走進社會。没有一個熟識的人；所有的同事都是男人，只有一位女人，她已和他們混得很熟了。</p>
<p>報館是營業性質而兼些官廳氣味的。當校對的有五六七位，我和一位姓Ｗ的半老先生就担任了緊要新聞這兩版。</p>
<p>空氣是緊張的，至少，給我許多新的刺激。第一件事使我不能忘記的：當我任事不久，承總編輯Ｙ先生的抬舉，派我代理副刋編輯了。原來这正式的編輯人請假已有二三個月，是那另一位女校對Ｘ女士和編外埠新聞的Ｇ先生兩人共同代理。Ｇ先生負審稿之責，Ｘ女士負其餘的事務。現在由我代理，而且總編輯又下了條子（她是私人拜托的），Ｘ女士便大大地不高興了。她藉口總編輯處理事情不合手續，打移交未曾通知她，就大閙而特閙。本來呢，論資格，她老得多，我才來不到兩個月；論人情，我雖是社長的世姪，她和社長也是世誼，還加上直接的友情。而且全館裏除了校對，工人等下級之外，和她都是久已熟識，嬉笑遊狂常在一處的。我的取得這位置的原因又是什麽呢，在這種報館裏？</p>
<p>誠然如Ｘ女士所說：因爲總編輯對我的偏心而已？而據Ｙ先生的解釋，則是他因爲我常常在副刋上寫文章，他算是償識了我的文章。社長旣有信要他在兩位女職員的中間隨意派一位，他當然派了我。</p>
<p>事情閙到左右爲難Ｙ先生也不好對不起Ｘ女士，於是打電報給請假的編輯Ｃ先生，要他無論如何趕快來销假。Ｃ先生不久來了，我仍然當校對。Ｘ女士和我仍言歸於好。</p>
<p>惡果旣已種下了，來日的患難正是方興未艾。剛走進社會的我，幼稚，簡單，天眞。我不知道應該對上級恭敬（形式上的禮節），連絡。那位Ｘ女士則正相反：她的「政治手段」非常高明，積極的和消極的都用以對付我；似乎非此不足以消她心頭之恨，而報我前日之仇。</p>
<p>恰好事又這樣凑巧：一次Ｗ先生校對總編輯的社論，掉了一段，下文語氣不接上文了。第二天報紙印出來，總編輯看了就大發雷霆。馬上下條子，扣薪洋五元。而且囑咐我們：以後校對社論，専由我負責。再承Ｙ先生的抬舉，於是這一個怨恨又天然地　到我身上來。</p>
<p>社會給女子的致命傷，就是貞操的箭。要抑制女子的發展，要破毁女子的權利，只要無端地甽她一個「品行不端」的罪名，縱使她有武則天，慈禧太后李清照等的聰明才智，也不足崇敬的。就因爲我比較好動，不注意「貞淑嫺靜」這些女子的固有道德，丨丨我好與男同事談論，或兩三人對坐清談，或靜聽他們論國際政治，甚或有時同一個男人在寢室裏研究問題等。丨丨而同時又不知道「吹牛打馬」，「撒嬌獻媚，」這些新的技術，我的罪就被輿論律定了（所謂輿論是報館裏羣衆的輿論）。</p>
<p>在某一個夜裏，因爲一位外勤記者請我給他記一篇頗有趣味的社會新聞，在我的寢室裏叙述他的見聞。時當六月天氣，像鴿籠的中國式洋房子，我們的小小校對室是不流通空氣的。大編輯室十來盞電燈，十多個人。爲了貪圖舒服，我就常常在寢室裏校對。寢室是我和Ｘ女士兩人的，但她是白天校對副刋，夜裏很少在這裏睡，所以也是非常清靜的。但雖曰寢室，和工作室連接着，而對面就是社長的辦公室，應該是個可以公開的地方，除我們睡覺鎖了門之外。</p>
<p>大約因　故事說到有趣的地方或者是寫不出一個什麽字的原故，使得我們發笑了。這笑聲傳入社長老先生的耳鼓，使他那厚的耳膜起了新的振動，他的神經感到不安，馬上就命令那記者到工作室去，而呌了我到他屋子裏大大敎訓一頓；說女子應該要「落落大方，」「貞嫺淑靜，」這才是女子的美德。</p>
<p>我到有些接受那「落落大方」四個字，許是我還脫不了些女孩子氣「忸忸怩怩「不很大方」我應該自省，我虚心接受了他丨我父親的好友丨丨的敎訓。</p>
<p>但第二次的敎訓，我不能不起反感。雖然生活的磨石壓迫我，我也只能暫時讓我失業，另謀别的飯碗去。</p>
<p>事情很簡單，就是報館裏開某次編輯會議，他在會議塲上當塲取銷我入會的資格。其他的男校對都在坐，Ｘ友士則請了假的，憑了什麽權威與理由他就這樣侮辱我？我眞想當塲問他，但是坐的誰有勇氣做我的後盾，這時我明白。我只氣得連一句話也没說就退了出來。事後我又想用法律的手續對付他，但我想：法律不能保障「我」的人格的。</p>
<p>我就這樣悄然離開了這報館。</p>
<p>我在社會上失敗回來；明知不是我缺乏能力，不是我缺乏勇氣；只是我缺乏社會意識，不知道怎樣把自己恰當地安置在每一個社會環境裏。</p>
<p>此後，我仍在社會上掙扎着困苦萬狀的生活。我所遇到的事情，是每一個環境給我一個意想不到的新刺激。我奇怪，我懷疑：難道我眞有什麽錯誤嗎？</p>
<p>女人啊，女人！走進社社似走進囚獄。</p>

<h3>特别女護士之羣</h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>「一二八」以前，在附近閘北的某某里内，有一被鄰人目爲「奇怪之家」的人家。這家内似乎住着很多的人，可是其中旣無龍鍾的老　，亦無襁褓中的嬰兒，而且　　眉男子也無一個，終日出入門戶的，儘是一些不老不少的女流之輩。這些女流輩平日的穿着，雖儘是很講究的旗袍皮鞋，但若將她們的頭脚端詳一下，你也會看出，她們之中頗有些差異。脚上穿得住高跟鞋的丨丨這種人，在她們中間，只佔十分之一二丨丨頭髮必是燙得彎曲曲的，臉上有紅有白也有黑。脚下拖起一雙半大不小晴雨兩用的丁柺皮鞋的改組派，她們的面孔白中帶黄色，頭髮不是梳得溜溜，便是油水示施，蓬蓬鬆鬆，活像一堆焦黄的乾稻草，再不然，便連那三千煩惱絲尙未擺脫，仍是挽的一個便壺把似的　子，吊在後頸窩上。</p>
<p>這些女子，是什麽樣的人呢？她們都是職業戰綫上的職業婦女哦！她們所幹的行業，是専替有錢人侍疾的特别看護婦，即好們光榮地自命着的Ｓpeclalnurse。這「奇怪之家」，是她們爲便利營業起見，多數人組織成功的一種同業組合似的公家。這種特别看護婦的出產地，也如一般看護婦一樣，是那些和帝國主義的軍艦一路來華的敎會學校和醫院。而這種組合，大都是畢業較久並厭倦了醫院呆板生活的人們，爲適合滬上有錢病家對於特别看護婦需要之大，而組織成的私人團體。因作特别看護，不但生活較爲自由，而報酬，在工作忙時，月入倍於或三四倍於普通護士的月薪。</p>
<p>講到報酬方面，那在她們的職業上，原有定章的。她們替人侍疾，分日夜兩班，兩者均以五元一次計算，如若懂英文，服侍外國籍病人，那是每次紋銀五兩。至於工作，也因病人的病勢而有輕重不等，普通一般，只是執行醫生的命令，按時給病人騐體溫，查呼吸，計脈搏，服藥，間或照料飲食便溺等。</p>
<p>這些女子，雖在物質生活上，因她們自身的勞力，能得相當的舒服與自由，然在結婚道上的成敗，仍脫不了現社會的旣成定律，即年輕的，貌美的，等不到走完那四五年的艱苦習藝時間，已早爲有產的病家以及野心的送生們藏之金屋去了。餘下的面貌不揚，或意志堅强的人們，經過幾年的習藝和幾年的職業追從後，不但靑春早將她們委棄於路旁，而結婚的機會，也早隨流光以逝。</p>
<p>實際上，像二十七八，或三十以上四十以下的她們，並非没有結婚的可能，只如俗語說的「高不成，低不就，」有錢有勢的，或者是摩登靑年們，不嫌她們太老，便嫌她們執業卑微，不會向她們垂靑，至於那些與她們年齡相若専靠自己勞力換飯喫的人，她們也不願低就，實以成長於那種富於虚僞與虚榮的環境中，而兩脚又時常出入於華貴的豪富之門的她們，對於　對結合的男女，婚後雙方均得以同等的勞力換取同等的享受的生活，她們還看不慣，加上封建意識尙十分濃厚的她們，仍以女子過了三十而嫁，是可恥的。因此種種複雜的原因，她們遂不得不偕同那些原由婚姻發生過問題，囿於家族間的封建思想，以及受的虚僞與麻醉的敎育。下過决心不嫁，方採取這條謀生之道，而年齡比她們更長的老女們，（這在她們中間，佔人數之半）一路終身度着那種専爲有錢的病人，洗頭摸脚，搽屎傾尿，或竟至供那些有錢有暇的假病人開心的難堪生活。而且不幸的她們，對於那罩有黑色面網的死神之來去，也得不可避免地日覩着，迎送着。在服侍有傳染病的患者時，她們更是冒有性命的危險。</p>
<p>另一方面，這些女子對於思想與學問的求進展，以及自身地位的謀改善，不但不熱心，而且不明白；這雖由於她們苟安心太强，然最大的原因，不能不歸之於她們所受的特殊敎育。僞善的宗敎家們，在「奉仕神」和「帮助鄰人」的口號之下，將馴羊似的她們無代價地榨取四五年之久，而所給與她們的學問和手藝呢？那是除了爲病人鋪床疊被，騐體溫，發藥，以及拿便盆之外，也不會再多出幾套來的。可是相反的，在不可見的禮物上，他們又很慷慨地將天國許給她們了。因此她們的意識中，以爲現在旣能自謀生活，不但今生的問題　得解决，而來世尙有幸福等着她們的。所以她們變的。是一種與人無忤與世無爭的超然物外的生活，而這種生活，每每又易流入一種絕對的自私自利之型。</p>
<p>除去表面的一切，在内的「性」生活上，加了宗敎的僞善與鎖鏈，無可諱言她們是受着更大的壓抑，所以她們中間，同性戀愛頗普遍，十之九每人有一最親密的女友。外表上，雖都名爲朋友，但那種同枕共被，體貼入微，相依相偎的情形，實遠超出普通朋友以上。</p>
<p>不管這種特别女護士之服役，只是限於有錢的病家，但它之能成爲一種適合女子的職業，是無問題的。所以我希望從事於這一業的姊妹們，在其經濟意味以外，更當特别努力於自身精神和肉體雙方的健全化；更希望熱心婦運的人們，對於這一項女子職業，能努力給以督促和指導。</p>

<h3>第一次世界大戰中的歐洲婦女</h3>
<p>— 黃念中</p>
<p>大家　在準備着第二次世界大屠殺，婦女們又要準備用眼淚送别她們赴戰的情人和兒子的現在，來談談上一次瘋狂當中的歐洲婦女，是不無意味的事。</p>
<p>一九一四年以後，在歐洲的每一個國家，幾千萬的工農和學生被「愛國」口號拖到戰壕去後，於是就有幾千萬個家族，幾千萬個女人和母親日夜焦急，日夜悲愁，在整整的四年裏，她們中間的大部分，爲了生活的焦急和對死者的悲哀所賠上的眼淚决不會比那一時代所耗費槍彈少些吧！</p>
<p>可是還有一種人也感到一些焦慮，那就是那許多偉大的企業家們感到勞動力的缺乏。有勞動能力的男子們都上火綫去了，剩下的婦女便作了他們解决這一個焦慮的對象。</p>
<p>在巴黎，倫敦以及許多大的產業都市，一切公共車輛的司機，賣票，一切產業領域的，服務員，以及一切商店的店員差不多全用婦女，馬路的跑街，販夫，走卒有時也用婦女，大的都市幾乎成了女兒世界。</p>
<p>她們是很苦的，尤其是那些軍人之妻。常常，在馬路上可以找到酗酒的女人（Ｄrunken　Women）那都是一些懷念征人的强烈的女性。雖然照布爾喬亞們說來，她們是離開了男人之後濫用自由，没有責任感，而且因爲可以得到征人的遺族津貼，而睚甘墜落的，但是這種論調顯然不對，她們大多數是因爲寂寞，因爲生活而願意陶醉忘情的。</p>
<p>更低層的婦女困苦更多，丈夫赴戰去了，家庭的用度，兒女的敎養，都要自己一手掙持。雖然也有點分居卹金，但那是十分無濟於理的。她們不得不把她們的兒女丢到貧民窟的寄宿學校，任他們半饖半飽，自己却以低於男子的工資，接國家製造殺害自己的丈夫和兒子的利器，或者替產業領袖們製造大批戰時投機的商品。當時的英國政府和商業組合爲了爭取這廉價的婦女的勞力，曾經有過不少的競爭，雙方都想在這些無助的勞動婦女身上取得特殊的戰時利便或物别的利潤。</p>
<p>但是，在這種非常時期，勞動婦女也獲得了許多可貴的經騐，她們試騐了自己的能力，粉碎了社會對於婦女的鄙棄的偏見，在一切產業部門都發揮了和男子同樣的能力和知識。在當時危險的彈藥工廠，困難的機械工塲，複雜的機械上的一切事務中都證明婦女的發明才能，適應和熱心都超過了男子，對於婦女的社會的，經濟的價値，没有人敢給低的評價了。</p>
<p>起初，在英國是不許婦女參加醫務工作的，許多熱心的婦女在法蘭西自動地創設戰地病院，成績卓著，她們的優良的成績，傳回了本國，於是本國的當道諸公馬上在醫務方面起用了婦女，後來，倫敦各地的衛戍病院除了門衛以外，上至名譽少佐的醫生，下至下士的管理都是知識婦女。在法國，救濟培爾基姆和北法蘭西的遭難者，扶助亞爾薩斯，羅蘭兩省的無家者，使數萬家族衣物不缺，使幾萬兒童安然就學，這都是法國知識婦女的勞績。</p>
<p>在大戰中，勞動婦女和知識婦女是嘗着了不少的辛苦，另一方面，她們也充分發揮了她們的創造力和組織力。她們丨丨尤其是勞動婦女的這一種對於自己力量的試騐的成功，伴着現實的苦難更促進了她們廣大的團結，在英國提出將來的職業保險，和賃銀的男女平等的要求的「全國婦女勞動組合」的組織，便是這種團結的具體例證。</p>
<p>也許大家要問，在這不世的變亂當中，安閒的布爾喬亞小姐們作些什麽？</p>
<p>大砲打不進她們的深閨　　，粗糙不堪的黑麵包决不會走到她們的唇邊，她們的生活是依樣的安適和輕鬆的。問或，在倫敦的馬路上可以看見一些穿起黄褐色的義勇兵服裝的上流女性，在作着所謂「防禦」工作，在戰地的安全地帶，也許可以碰到一兩個參觀的「慈善」貴婦，但這一切都是她們私生活的浪漫蒂克，借用高爾基的話是「爲了單調的緣故」，是無關大衆的。</p>
<p>其次順便說到歐戰時的兩性關係，從雷馬克的書裏，我們可以看到一些上層軍士的性的混亂，從巴比塞的書裏，我們可以看到一些下層兵士的失敗的性的追求。大戰的主謀人把成千整萬的年靑强壯的男女隔絕起來，但是使他們通過絕棄人性，保持修道院的心情，一般是不可能的事。因此，在前綫上，兵士們有三w(Ｗomen,WineWar)兵士們而第一Ｗ·還添了許多偷偷的，交換兵士的麵包的事件。在後方，浪漫的故事成了最普通的現象。這一切更表現了所謂一夫一妻制度的虚僞，同時私生兒的處分法成了現在交戰國家的黨道們最感棘手的事。</p>
<p>戰雲又在濔漫今日的，婦女們丨記住第一次歐洲婦女得到的敎訓！</p>
<h3>生活在兩種飢餓下的人們</h3>
<p>— 奔子</p>
<p>星期日的午後，我走過大世界，在牠側面的牆壁下，企立了大堆的人，我好奇地也擠了進去，原來他們在看第二特區法院的佈告，牠的大意是；「强姦未滿十五歲的女子判有期徒刑七年，二人以上輪姦各判無期徒刑······以維持人道與社會風化」：看完了，我就連想起十二月十一日申報的社會新聞；「少女年十五，惡少九人輪姦一夜」來了，這張告示也許是爲了這事才再三的把所謂法律條文公佈出來，以警懼市民的吧。</p>
<p>這是多麽一幸與可憐的事體呵，我們生活在這凹凸形的社會里，受了二重飢餓的巨石重壓，連輕微的氣也透不過來了！這段社會新聞，明白的說明；爲了吃飯，一個未懂世事發育還未成熟的女孩，就爲飢寒驅使幹了神女的賣淫生涯；一羣爲了要發洩餓狼似的肉慾的靑年，就將這未成年的女孩子輪姦起來了，這是性的飢餓衝動底表現呵！</p>
<p>在這世界經濟恐慌底狂瀾，衝擊着整個世界的每一角落，這恐慌的黑流經過洶湧的波動，我國的農村極度的貧困與破產了，國内的封建地主，資產階級高利貸與苛重的稅收，也是說明了農村陷落的好資料呢！成羣的農村婦女，爲了逃避飢饉，她們都跑向城市來，她們認爲城市是她們逃飢的糧食所，可是，當她們集中到這口糧似乎豐滿的都市的十字街頭，她們的幻影，就像小孩子玩耍的美麗皂泡，不經久的就裂碎了丨這末，她們就開始徘徊徬徨，爲了兩餐吃不飽的飯，和城市的失業女勞動者一樣，自動或被誘引她一個個做了夜生活出賣皮肉的職業者丨農村經濟破產的深度化與城市的勞動婦女失業的增多，賣淫的妓女就正比例的高速度加多了！</p>
<p>現社會的，一切都是商品化了，性生活的本能要求也就畸形地發展，一方面，女子的相對過剩，另一方面，就是男子大量的過着寡佬生活，前者的結果是後者的原因而產生的這奇怪的現象，原因是很單簡的：不景氣瀰漫的年頭，失業的男子一天天的多了，有職業的也是過着困苦或半飢餓的生活，那兒有剩的錢來娶老婆呢？且，結婚後的生活擔負的恐懼，也是會令男子害怕結婚的了那末，他們爲了滿足性本能的要求，唯一的辦法就是去嫖妓！</p>

<p>金雞漸軟化　標紗前市開盤、形勢繼續上漲、因上日金價在高峯收盤　　美棉又漲　　　心良好、塲中賣户缺乏、詎料拍至二三盤、市價反動突起、現紗客銷不暢、且金價跌進一千元關、賣風較濃、結果各月均反跌一·二角、午後市塲謠風復熾、關當局又愼重聲明、無集中現金之意、且有種種流言、均與多頭不利、市價盤盤下落、結果各月均跌二·六·八·九角、查賣出通記七百包賡豐四千五百包、愼昌四百包、頣大五百五十包、長豐五百五十包、同和一千一百五十包潤康二千二百五十包、新華五百包、德記六百五十包、買進源大六百包、裕大六百包、大豐二千包、森康一千二百五十包、恒德一千四百包、仁豐九百包、元一八百包、瑞大一千五百五十包愼記一千三百五十包、長豐七百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下</p>

<h3>美棉市氣形頗堅穩</h3>

<h3>上週美棉漲跌兩難</h3>
<p>紐約十二月二十一日電告一週棉市狀况云、投　贊成本棉季繼續施行彭海德案者雖佔多數、但棉市興趣、並未因之而濃厚、價格梢起、　賣或多方了結隨之而　、假期在邇、故市况卒歸平淡、商人現待關於明年限額之表示、本週交易大都爲近期　平、國内各處零星貿易之報告、頗爲良好、一般交易起色、故人氣　佳、惟投機家之興趣、汔未顯著也、棉花借欵額定一角、　分故售價不能視此爲低、而價高時、則棉農公儲棉花、有繼續出售之可能、衆料市况介於旣不能跌又不能漲、　間殆將　現　價格而站住耳、必同業購胃更旺、而後始可維持漲風、同時德國貨物與美棉交　之說、似無實現之望、蓋以與國務院國際貿易之一般政策相抵觸、</p>
<h3>糧食麫粉清疲中有制止力</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平定不前之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好一角六分左右、坎拿大互有四分之出入、當開價時、本月份因結賬已近、浮多交易、頗有了結、市氣曾度軟弱、以後因雙方甚寂、出戶更衡、故市氣又轉平定、迨至下午開盤、本月份因現銷去路尙活、在不即不諿之中逐步吸收、故市氣疲中帶定、遠期因廠方不出、内地、繼有收進、市氣帶挺、但交易清淡之際、此種上落、實　平靜之至也、結果本月份較小二釐半、一月份漲一分二月份漲七釐半、三月份漲一分二釐半、四月份漲半分、五月份小二釐半云、</p>
<h3>現麥入持之下賣方讓步</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平穩之象以洋麥報價芝加哥好一角六分、坎拿大互有四分之上落、當開價時、各月份交易依然清淡、惟以出戶已少、反見略有抵補、因此各盤市氣、似見帶緊、不過交易甚寂、此種漲落、殊覺平淡而已、結果本月份不動、一月份好三分、三月份好一分、現麥市面、擯持多日、昨以客戶讓步、喊價落三四分不等、開出東徐州麥四元、次三元九角九分、六合寳應麥三元九角四分揚州瑤灣麥三元九角三分、海州麥三元九角六分、蚌埠麥三元九角七分蔣家壩麥三元九角八分、漯河麥三元九角二分、計一萬二千包、由福新辦去云、</p>

<p>（滬北）昨河埠各路來源二十餘號、市銷方面、各色仍屬清淡、惟白元高貨零拆略化、市形白粳高貨小角許、中次小角外、各尖及早薄稻平疲、白元定勢、</p>
<h3>暹邏碎米跌小一角</h3>
<p>期洋米續有成交</p>
<p>昨客米本街胃口尙香、内地亦有應酬、惟在年底銀根奇緊、進戶吃價均低、且洋麥存平豐足、到頭不絕洋商復又每日求售、市形又居平軟、暹羅碎米連日定訂甚多、市上到存亦旺、昨日祇有内地辦去二千包、價乃立小一角、其他各米以貨主堅持、尙能勉强站住、西貴米開一千包、未被影響帶小、各路客秈存已定、　日内地去化不及以前之　、市形亦見平軟、大約年内爲日無多、倘無意外去路、市面不致十分昂漲、期洋米續由達孚售出四月份西　五百噸、由本街辦去、而洋商售意甚健、年内尙有大批成議之可能云、</p>

<h3>南北貨木耳疲而復振</h3>

<h3>笑口將不常開</h3>
<p>— 徐雉</p>
<p>人人說今年是雜誌年、但我更要說：同時今年還是「小品文年」，「幽默年」。在事實上、今年所出版的専載「幽默小品」的刋物確是特别多：原有的「論語」自不必說，是専弄「幽默」的開路先鋒，繼出的「人間世」「華安」「華美」……等，也是本年内有名的以「幽默」見長的刋物；同時，就是有許多大雜誌，也因見於「幽默」之風盛行而不得不特刋「幽默」的小品文字。至於本年内盛行的小品文，在我看來，也是由此「幽默」之風中引出來的。不說别的，就是什麽「小品文妙選」的書名，也就够「幽默」的了。丨丨這樣，在大家說「今年是雜誌年」之下，再說今年是「幽默年」，因而更說一九三四年是「幽默時代」，誰能說是不對的呢？</p>
<p>「幽默」二字，本來是Ｈumour一字的音譯。因爲今年我國「幽默」之風盛行，在雜誌上，在一般報屁股上，在宴會上，乃至在馬路上，都可以看到或聽到人們在談「幽默」，所以這「幽默」二字的意義如何？英文Ｈumour一字譯爲中文究竟應該是什麽？這便發生了問題。有人說Ｈumour一字仍須譯作「幽默」，又有人說當譯作「幽妙」，理有人主張譯作「語默」，而雜誌「華美」甚至以這問題的討論爲其發刋詞，說是爲了要免除什麽「通假」的毛病，主張用「語妙」。丨由此當可想到人們是在怎樣注意「幽默」了。</p>
<p>然而，「幽默」文章的長處在那裏呢？梁實秋敎授說：我們不看廣告，要看貨色。現在且隨便舉出一些「幽默」小品來看吧丨丨</p>
<p>（一）『我小時在一個敎會學校讀書，該校自小學一年級起，便是外國人直接敎授英文。所以有時小學生不能直接用英語表達他的意思。有一次在一個外國小姐英文班上，一個小學生小便急了，要想出去上厠所，乃指褲襠向外國小姐說：Ｗaterwillconeouthere（水要從這兒出來了）。』</p>
<p>（二）『一個靑年男女向一位摩登女郎說：「我很愛你啊！」</p>
<p>那位摩登女郎回答道：「我知道，我也很愛你呀！」</p>
<p>「那麽，你不愛别人了嗎？」</p>
<p>「如果我愛别人，你怎樣辦？」</p>
<p>「那我一定要用手槍打死那個爲你所愛的人！」</p>
<p>「那最好請你準備兩架機關槍！」』</p>
<p>（三）『作家白薇女士與楊騷吵嘴，直氣得她恨恨的說：</p>
<p>「我非殺了你不可！」</p>
<p>「你能殺了我也好。」楊騷硬着頭走到白薇的面前這樣說。</p>
<p>「我還留着你嗎？」於是白薇拿過來一把剪子把楊騷的頭髮剪下了幾根。』</p>
<p>我們單只看了這幾件「貨色」，就已經覺得够「幽默」的了，但是，這顃的東西，除了使人看了開心發笑外，還有什麽其他的意義呢？卽使其中也有富於諷刺性的文字，但是因爲牠没有理論作後盾的緣故，我們看了之後，除了覺得痛快外，仍是得不到什麽，牠給與我們的印象仍是非常糢糊的。</p>
<p>我以爲中國的一般讀者，他們在幾次大的運動中，已經得到了一個寳貴的敎訓：知道理論的重要（至於需要什麽樣的理論，那當然是另一問題）；而且，隨着中國文化運動的發展，一般讀者的知識水平已較高了，因而他們所要求的還不　　　　　　　　　就是比較深刻的有系統的理論，經過了本年的「幽默」思潮之後，嘗試了一般的小品文之後，他們對於有系統的深刻的理論的要求是更迫切了。我可以說，現在的一般讀者，他們買一本書或一份雜誌，絕不是隨便地爲了消遣而去買的，其目的一定是探求深刻的理論；他們看一篇文章，是在想因此而能得到關於某問題的深刻知識，而不是隨便翻閱了事。所以，我認爲在本年内盛行的「幽默」小品乃至一般小品文，必不能再繼續維持其優越的地位。不信，且看一九三五年的中國出版界罷，看是専載「幽默小品」的刋物最受一般讀者歡迎呢，還是「中山文化敎育館季刋」，「新人」，「世界知識」，</p>
<p>「長城」，「女聲」……最受讀者歡迎？</p>

<h3>想像，生活，文藝作品</h3>
<p>— 梓</p>
<p>没有現實社會，當然就不會有文藝作品：文藝作品，乃是作家所描畫的由現實社會所產生的一種生活形態。但是，作家的描畫現實，並不是和照相師的攝影那樣的只是原形地死板地將現實的事物模寫出來；他之描畫現實，是要通過他的複雜的腦筋，而精細地藝術地描畫的。在這中間，所謂「想像」，便是必要的了。事實上，一般浪漫主義者的作品，自然是帶着濃厚的想像色彩；就是以實證主義爲其創作方法的自然主義者的作品，在某一點上說來，也是通過其想像力而描寫出來的。大家知道，弗羅培爾是自然主義的作家，但也在創作時，必須找一個唯一的名詞來代表他心中的一件事物，找一個唯一的形容詞來描畫那事物的特色；這如果他不靜心去思索，想像，那還能遂其心願嗎？左拉更是已經走到頂點的自然主義者，他創作的態度簡直和科學家一樣，先要去蒐休材料，親自走到他所要描寫的人物中去生活，　　去訪問那些都他的創作有關係的　女，然後　　實地　他所要描</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>畫的事物描畫出來：這看來好像是没有想像的成份的了，但你能說他的「羅貢，馬格爾」叢書，那麽龐大的一部小說，其故事的構成，其各種人物的表現，其各個塲面的佈置，其詞句的組織，没有通過他的想像力嗎？當然是不能這樣說的丨丨丨由此看來，在文藝作品是中有想像的成份，乃是不能否認的事實了。</p>
<p>然而，所謂「想像」，並不是作家憑空的虚構，而是他在其生活的經騐下進行的。無論怎樣善於「想像」的作家，他都不能想像出人間所絕對没有的思想和境地，他都不能想像出與其社會生活毫無關係的事物來。「西遊記」的作者說孫悟空一個筋斗可以翻十萬八千里，這當然是想入非非的「想像」了，但倘若人間根本就没有「翻筋斗」這回事，根本不没有「十萬八千里」這幾個數目字，那他還能這樣「想像」嗎？更深一點說，如果中國社會没有社怪思想存在着，没有那些現實生活空虚而要去找幻想的境地的人，那「西遊記」的作者還能單憑其想像以作出那樣的神怪小說嗎？</p>
<p>從來不少的文學理論家，他們把文學中的「想像的要素」弄得非常神秘，以爲文學作品完全是由作家的想像產生的。英國柯迭生甚至大著其「想像論」，力說文藝作品之所以能感動人者，完全在於其有想像的要素；就是比較進步的文學理論家拉斯金也說詩是「用想像的力暗示起高尙的情緒的高尙的根據。」這樣，眞無怪乎我們的文學理論家之「重視想像」，把它與生活經騐分離了！</p>
<p>如果要說「重視想像」，並將它神秘化，那便不得不推出唯美主義者來。王爾德在其「架空的頽廢」中除說「架空」是「美而非實際的故事」外，更猛烈地攻擊自然主義者左拉道：「從藝術的見地看來，左拉的作品差不多全無價値，只有零分。………我們對於藝術的要求，是珍奇，魅力和想像，簡單地說，只是美而已。所謂眞眞存在的人，就是這個現實世界上從來不曾存在過的人的意思。所以作家要從現實世界假有人物時，最少限度，也該不用實世界人物的寫生，而須改造這些人物。但是左拉的人物，却全是寫生。他的作品毫無價値，就因爲這個緣故。」這眞是玄妙之至！其實，就是王爾德及其唯美主義也是十九世紀末英國社會生活的一個產兒。如果没有十九世紀开英國市民與許多寄生層的享樂的頽廢生活，那便不會有王爾德的許多「架空」的文藝作品及其唯美主義。王爾德的享樂生活，唯美藝術及其一切玄妙的想像，都是當時英國的新市民與許多寄生層所具有的，王爾德不過是將其反映在文學上乃至其個人的生活上來而已丨</p>
<p>總之，作家在創作時，是需要而且一定要想像的，但這並不是與其社會生活分離的憑空幻想，而是在其生活經騐與知識的基礎上進行的；就是那些想入非非的作家，其作品也是其社會生活的反映，絕不是憑空的想像的產物。至於有些作家之不描寫現實的事物，而要去追求現實以外的空想境地，其原因乃在於他的社會生活規定他不能或者不敢正視現實，使他在創作的時候只好訴諸於單純的想像；同時，也有些作家雖然努力去描畫現實，但結果不是將現實歪曲了，便是對於現實表現得不充分，成爲空洞的東西，這原因也是在於他們在其社會生活的規定之下，不能正確地認識現實，充分地表現現實。所以，一個作家，必要勇敢地去接近現實生活，必要正確地去認識現實，必要有豐富的社會生活的經騐和知識，當然也必要有藝術的表現才能，那他在創作時，其想像，其主觀的意識，其描寫的法則，纔能適合於客觀事物的狀態和要求，因而也纔能作岀偉大的作品。大家知道，屠格夫曾經描畫岀了一個虚無主義者巴扎諾夫，「阿爾志巴綏夫也將與屠格夫相同的社會學的美學的課題給了自己」，描畫岀了一個沙甯，但公正的批評家都説巴扎諾夫是真實的人物，沙甯是「構成」的人物，所以阿爾志巴綏夫的描寫是失敗的，那末，這是為的什麽原因</p>

<h3>根據心理學見地的有效學習律</h3>
<p>— 堉</p>
<p>没有看見過一個智識平庸的人會創造出他不世的事業來的。那末，智識究從何處得來的呢？我以爲，除了「學習」，恐怕没有其他更好的辦法。</p>
<p>今日的世界，無論什麽事情都要「科學化」，經濟而有效，才能戰勝人家。對於求學的態度也是一樣，决不能再如古代讀書人那樣的「埋首十年」，以求「神而明之」，因爲那種求學的態度，作有閒階級的有閒消遣則可，在今日一般注意時間經濟的人，是不能走這樣迂緩的路的。</p>
<p>五年前，吾師黃敬思博士曾在講台上口譯過灰帕爾（Whipple）的Howtostudy三十八條，意義雋永，是具有心理學見地人有效學習律。我想，這對於一個苦於不知怎樣去學習的人，倒是很可以作他的座右銘的。這三十作條的有效學習律就是：一，保持身體的健康。二，注意並補救身體上的缺陷。三，造成合於學習的「環境」。四，養成在一地學習的習慣。五，學習須有一定的時間。六，下次的功課在這次課後就應有相當的預備。七，開始工作。九，集中注意力！十，用腦不要過度，也不要煩惱。十一，工作時以學習和記憶爲目的。十二，學習須有「動機」。十三，去除爲敎員學習的觀念。十四，非到萬不得已時决不要輕於問人。十五，「目的」須完全了解。十六，要得到新知識，必須要溫習舊學問。十七，預習的時候先窺其大略。十八，若遇困難程度不同的工作多種列陳於前，可按自己已往經騐或理想，先做難的或容易的。十九，所學習的動作須合於將來的應用（如筆順的先後，練習時的肌肉運動，極易養成習慣的）。二十，學習重要的工作，以作永久之用。二十一，注意並補救自己的缺點。二十二，每日學習的功課，須揀其重要者加以判斷或批評。二十三，次要的功課或知識，無須費過多的時間去記憶牠。二十四，學習時間不要太短，也不要太長。二十五，須加以練習的功課應分次練習，集中練習是没有多大效率的。二十六，工作須在相當時間停止，並須留一記號。一十七，用功之後，須有相當的休息時間。二十八，用各種方法使自己的思想集中下來。二十九，養成能爲「原則」舉例的習慣。三十，養成心理複習的習慣。三十一，遇必要時可在書上加批寫。三十二，若學習的材料多且難，可作「綱要」，以便熟記。三十三，工作時須應用已得的知識。三十四，須熟記専門名詞的定義，公式，日期，綱要（一但須强記，且須了解）。三十五，熟記的材料難於記憶時，得想種種機械的方法使之記憶。三十六，讀詩，演說辭，不必分段。三十七，朗讀，速誦，易於記憶。三十八，上課時筆記不要太多，但須養成整理筆記的習慣。</p>

<p>呢？我以爲這只有在他們的社會生活（包括藝術才能及其對現實的認識力）中去长說明：前者能正確地認識現實，表現現實的時代精神，而後者則不能。</p>
<p>生活</p>
<h3>小學敎師</h3>
<p>— 印渠</p>
<p>小學敎育，在敎育階段的全歷程中，其地位之重要，幾人人能知之，且人人能道之。然而實施這種敎育的小學敎師，他們的生活，却像一枝枝可憐的衰草，生長在陰濕的牆角裏，没有太陽，没有雨露，天地好像任牠自然的生，又任牠自然的滅，毫不受人注意。</p>
<p>雖然，整個小學敎育界中，也有少數受較高待遇的，但畢竟在數百萬小學敎師中，僅占最小數的最小數，同時，卽在上海，也除了市立，工部局立及少數的私立學校外，多數小學敎員所過的日子，並不比窮鄕壤間的小學敎員有較合理的生活。</p>
<p>大多數的小學敎員生活在水平綫之下丨</p>
<p>譬如以離上海僅三十公里的某城爲例，那裏的小學敎育，近年來無論在形式上精神上都有長足的進步，爲許多到那裏參觀過的敎育家所稱道。然敎員們的薪水還是低小得可以！那待遇標準，是依照各人學歷的高胝作標準的：如高中師範畢業的爲二十六元，中學畢業的爲二十四元，鄕師畢業的爲二十二元，這待遇標準雖較江北的某縣僅八元之數略多，但若除了六元的膳食，所剩的也僅十數元了。並且很顯見的，這待遇標準並不以眞正的敎學效率作依歸，只徒然的重視頭銜罷了（例如四年制的有専業訓練的鄕師，其待遇反薄於没有専業訓練的四年制舊制中學）。結果使那一般眞正能敎育事業獻身的敎員們忍氣呑聲，怨憤塡膺。</p>
<p>且某城與上海密邇，在接壤之區，往往一個鎭上設有市立小學，又設有縣立小學，僅此數步之隔，他們的待遇不截然不同（按：上海市鄕區小學待遇最低爲三十五元，多至百元不等）。這在精神上使多數小學敎員陷頽唐，不振作的境地，然究之實際，這是中國敎育没有整個計畫的緣故，又何忍深責小學敎員呢？</p>
<p>嘗聞某小學敎師感喟的說：「我們這一代，靠了父兄的餘蔭，尙能受中等敎育；可是我們的後一代呢，我們這些做父親的，將拿什麽去敎育培植他們呢？」這種身世之感，恐在小學敎育界中正普遍地濔漫着。</p>
<p>除俸給之外，關於「保障」更談不到。敎員的聘期，依然是半年，故大多數人都存「五日京兆」之心，一個學期終了，敎員更迭的頻繁，與政治舞臺差可比擬，這對於敎學及訓練上的浪費，着實不小。他如女敎員的生產期間的優待，養老金的規定等也都無從談到。</p>
<p>在這樣的待遇之下，而他們的工作却並不能稍爲輕鬆，每日自朝晨以迄黃昏，除了每週一千幾百分鐘的課務，另外尙須費更多的時間去担任管理兒童，批改課卷，塡寫表簿等學校行政上的事務，逢到兒童課業或運動等對外競賽之舉行，敎師更恨不能日以繼夜的去從事指導工作，因爲競賽雖是兒　童，但考騐的成績却是屬於敎師的名譽與前途的。他如什麽展覽會等等，名目上都是學生的，骨中　都無非使敎師們於勞苦的例行公事之外，再加上許多意外的工作而已。總之，他們的生活是忙，忙，第三個還是忙！若再加上前述的窮，則小學敎師的生命便爲窮與忙所交織的了。</p>
<p>住在洋房裏的所謂敎育専家，却口口聲聲的說；「小學敎育是清高事業，小學敎育是清高事業丨」然而這種麻醉劑的注射已絕對的没有效騐了。去年十二月十五日各報所載「嘉興女子曾任小學敎員及代理校長的張玉珍，因薪給菲薄，爲同鄕女友向在上海永安公司任女招待的莊素貞誘引來滬，以致慘遭奸汚」一事，卽反映現任的一般小學敎師不能安於其清高職業的地位，而亟亟謀其生計之解决。</p>
<p>時代的潮流，是一刻不息的向前輪動着的，那般担任小學敎師的，因爲工作的過於繁忙，以及經濟條件的物質環境的束縛，使他們極少有進修的機會。離開學校後不過幾年的光陰，他們就已經遠離新思想的空氣，而慢慢的没落了，没落了！</p>
<p>「小學敎師是賣少年」，小學敎師們常常會痛苦的啃嚙着這句話。</p>
<p>離我的故鄕數里之遙，有一所小學校，從前的校長，今日是充當了該校的校役了。雖然他不能把握住時代，追踪前往，以至自召没落之禍，然要亦人間的一大悲劇也。</p>
<p>這一切，都是在經濟條件不所畸形發育出來的，小學敎育越說越重要，小學敎師的待遇之改善，史亟不容緩，但不知我們的敎育専家，在夢中亦曾留意及此否也！</p>
<p>海外通訊組</p>
<h3>西綫一瞥黑人魚</h3>
<p>— 楊孝誠</p>
<p>意大利熱那亞能訊</p>
<p>提起「西綫」二字，大家立刻會聯想到世界小說名著「西綫無戰事」和它的電影罷？儘管我用這兩個字標題有雷同的嫌疑，然而我是以我們的故鄕上海爲起航的中心，這樣去分别東渡日本或美國爲東向航綫，以西來歐洲爲西向航綫才命題的。我現在已經完成了至西歐的航程，到達了意大利了。</p>
<p>一個困臥船中的旅客，要想描述他所經過的國家或者那些商埠的政治經濟狀况，這實在是不可能的，因爲從外表的瀏覽是不能没悉它們的社會狀况的深處。可以供我作通訊材料的，只有那在旅途中所親眼見到的「黑人魚」。</p>
<p>「美人魚」這個名辭在中國是閙得很響的了，但我現在要報告大家，世界上還有許多「黑人魚」呢。雖然他們是黑而不美，引不起各色人等的注意因此從來未見有航海遊客提及過，但說到他們的藝術，却也是游泳的藝術，那不但能和「美人魚」一樣，能够與魚比美，堪稱爲「人魚」，而且在某幾點上說，「黑人魚」的藝術或者還要高過「美人魚」呢。這些「黑人魚」，他們生活在沿熱帶綫的各大商埠碼頭的海水中，雖然其中並不完全都是黑色人種，然而因爲他們終年沐浴於日光海水之中，大體上都是皮色漆黑發光，實在可以統稱爲「黑人魚」。這種人在新加坡就已有了，不過以非洲東岸法國殖民地「其布的」所產的最爲特出。他們是赤身露體的浮沉於海中，泅起水來很快，也很自然。他們最特别的藝術是：他們可以手足不動的穩坐在水裏，盤足式地如在陸上打坐一樣筆直坐着，但是可以不沉下去。普通泅水的人要靠手足運動才能浮起的，他們却能不作姿式地坐浮於水中。「其布的」是一個風浪很大的港口，那些「黑人魚」却絲毫不畏風浪。一個大浪來了，他們能隨浪起落；甚至隨着浪滾動，可以穩坐於浪頭的高峯上。這種藝術恐怕不是我們的「美人魚」趕得上的罷。但所有的「黑人魚」不但不是世界上聞名的游泳明星，而且是些乞丏，是受人玩弄的。他們每逢船到，就都羣集在船的周圍要錢。船上旅客把銀角子向水裏擲去，他們可以攢入水中用手拿起來；有的更可以用口啣起來。他們有時上船來，在很高的地方投入水中去捉住旅客們所投的銀角子，旅客們便以此捉弄他們，用以取笑消遣丨游泳本是一種藝術，一種運動，但現在却有許多人把游泳作爲一種職業了。「黑人魚」也是長於這種藝術的，然而這種藝術在他們手裏却只成爲他們乞食的手段，同樣的藝術，也隨着職業才的身分而有貴賤之别啊！</p>
<h3>雕刻師</h3>
<p>— 鳳池</p>
<p>爲雕刻師安排的路子是有好多條的，在這種専門人才尙不顯得怎末過剩的今日，他們應該是比較有出路的罷？鍍過金的雕刻師，回國來可以在美衑専科學堂裏當個敎授，一個鐘頭拿這未三四元錢不算什麽希奇；至於雕雕石膏像或替人擺擺橱窗，則更是下乘的工作了。若能和偉人名人們交往，因而接到一兩件鑄銅像的生意做做，這才是一件可人意的事。名雕刻師替人鑄一尊銅像的報酬是决不會菲薄的，最少也有五六千元的進益。定價萬元或萬五千元左右也並不是什麽不經見的。自然，一尊銅像需要他們周年半載以上的時間，但一般算來，他們的月入仍是很可觀的。</p>
<p>關於這種雕刻師，我不想在他們身上多作文章，底下我只想把一些從美術學堂雕刻系裏出來的學生們的生活大略的提一提。這種學生是没有多少好去處的。作爲一個自由職業者，他們自然可以接到一點零星的小生意做做，至於要想得到一個固定的位置或企求獲得一筆大生意，那却不免是一個不易實現的想望了。卽使他們在這方面眞有所獲得，那得到的所謂位置也不過是一個聊以資糊口的東西，所謂大生意在名雕刻師固可獲得一萬或八千的，在他們却不免要折而又折，减而又减，終極也許得不到名家的半數，人家甚至還要懷疑他的能力够不够，而至於取消合同。他們以同等能力而遭這樣的歧視，是大可値得人們同情的了。</p>
<p>他們自然也還可以走到中等學校裏去敎幾點鐘書，視學校規模的大小每個鐘點拿到五角，八角，一元不等的報酬。他們大都懂得一點圖畫的，所以除了敎手工石膏練習之外，還可敎敎圖畫。他們也可以在公司商店裏擺擺立體橱窗，論件計値，每件也可拿到一二十元或二三十元不等的酬金。他們還可以替人家刻石膏像，其報酬難得一定，視彼此關係和所需時間而不同。也有刻各式各樣的石膏像發賣的。刻石膏像先須用一種特製的爛泥（聽說產自無錫，上海美術學校附近的文具店或工藝社裏都有賣的）製成模型，由模型製成中空的印模，從印模裏才可以鑄印出許多的膏像來。這中間的手續自然並不怎樣簡單，單就用具一項來說，也就有許多大大小小各式不同的骨製的鐵製的鋼製的鑽子，鑿子，刀子，······等等。每個膏像的價目從一二元起到二二十元不等。</p>
<p>他們比較好的去處是走到電影公司裏去。他們在電影公司裏有許多事可作，雖然工作上不一定全合乎本行。電影公司最需要他們的是製作「模型」。這種模型有時是電影公司缺少不得，有時却是偷工减料的一個方法。我們知道，片子上所攝的影像的大小，是被實物與開麥拉間的距離所决定的。開麥拉放得遠，大的事物在膠片上會變小；開麥拉放得近，小的事物在膠片上也會顯得大。根據這個道理，電影公司對於那搭置困難，工程浩大，需費甚多的佈景，多不完全搭出，而部分的利用一些小的模型來代替。這種模型，像輪船，火車，寳塔，宮殿，城樓，堡壘······等，因構造的比例匀稱，用起來和眞的並無兩樣，而可以完全瞒過觀衆。輪船失火，巨厦延燒，只須把一些不値錢的模型輪船，模型巨厦燒了就完事了，害豈不省事省費？</p>
<p>還有一種模型，如古代騎馬的英雄之類，有時也是需要的，但這若用古裝眞人眞馬實地化裝攝製，不但多所花費又多麻煩，而其結果有時反不如用模型的來得討好。不過在電影公司裏作這種事，不一定是長期性質，一件模型作好了從公司得到二三十元或三四十元的酬勞，又須另自奔前程了。</p>
<p>不過在電影公司裏，他們還可以做别的事的，比如搭立體佈景，或作字幕等，也常是需要他們。所以一個不怎末得志而又確有若干心得的雕刻師，在電影公司裏總是可以找到一些零星工作的。這家公司的工作完了，又有那家的工作在等着他。如此多方經騐，假如有優異成績的話，實授一件職務也並不是全不可能的。</p>

<h3>觀湖南同鄕會游藝會以後</h3>
<p>— 周敏</p>
<p>丨湖南電影明星歌舞明星的大會串丨</p>
<p>在湖南同鄕會籌募旅滬小學基金的游藝會上，差不多是誰也感到了滿足的，那不僅是集合了湖南的電影歌舞界的人材，並且提供了我們話劇，一個適應着這人材大集會的新的内容與形式的劇本丨「臨時演員」。</p>
<p>把一個有聲電影的攝影塲搬上舞台是不容易的吧！在觀衆們的理想中，都以爲藝術的王國是充滿着自由快樂和歡欣的而這裏恰告訴了觀衆們一幅眞實的情景。他們丨臨時演員丨雖是電影工作中少不得的人物，然而他們却是永遠被冷視，且永遠被觀衆們遺忘的。他們以最長時間的工作，換取最低的代價。他們是扮演社會實生活的老手。在他們的閒談中我們可以聽出現代社會實生活的眞實。在現社會中電影是工業化了，他們做着這工業生產的生產者，却過的是一種衣食不周的凄苦生活。</p>
<p>這個劇的主題在表現臨時演員的眞實生活。攝影塲要拍的戲是義勇軍抗敵殺賊的一幕。義勇軍不因民族英雄的受創而敗退，其努力殺敵之處演來眞是很眞切的。不過這個戲終因形式的限制，由拍戲的假轉到眞實，再拍戲，再轉到眞實，不免破壞了戲劇的眞實之感，戲中戲佔的成分不免過多了一點。</p>
<p>劇作者的手法是相當圓熟的，他把三十餘人的一個塲面處理得個個有戲，劇中主角是臨時演員Ｃ，其餘話人亦無不重之感。臨時演員Ｃ曾經在東北抗敵過來的，爲了生活的壓迫才去做臨時演員，而所拍的戲又正是抗敵，因此常常激發起他的情緒，凡此都寫得極爲自然。在攝取兩個镜頭的過程中，描寫了如前面所說如是眞實的内容，這在這當今冷落的劇壇上不能不說是很好的收獲了。</p>
<p>由於導演者　雲衛先生的努力，使這個龐雜的塲面没有什麽紊亂之處。每一個人的做戲都使觀衆看得很清楚的。演員們全很努力，都得到了相當的收獲。就中尤以臨時演員Ｃ「桃李刦」主角袁牧之君爲最成功。飾導演的萬籟天君本來是電影導演，演來很能適合身分。飾經理的蕭英君活畫出一個代表老板的典型。飾女明星的胡萍女士演來也恰到好處。臨時演員Ａ魏鶴齡君雖然有了不少的收獲，可惜被他的輕舉妄動把頂點削弱了。其他如佈景的偉大眞實，效果的美妙亦使本劇生色不少。</p>
<p>除話劇外，還有王人美，黎莉莉，黎明暉，胡笳，徐來諸女士的獨唱，明月社，梅花圃，新華社的歌舞若于節目，可惜我對於唱哥跳舞太外行了丨丨自然對於話劇也並不那個丨，不好說什麽，不過我總覺得整個節目都很清楚，四來　種各貨雜呈的，冗雜，紊亂的狀態是没有了，這不能不算是這次游藝會的進步。</p>

<h3>目蓮戲</h3>
<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>目蓮是佛之大弟子。有大神通，相傳他曾到地獄去救過母親。現今各地流行的盂蘭盆會（舊歷七月中元節時候舉行），就是根源於這個故事而演變，而流傳的。舊戲中的「目蓮救母」，「滑油山」等所表演的也是這個人所共知的事蹟。目蓮是一個極盡孝道的人，他在過去的中國封建社會中應該被在上者視爲一個榜樣的人，而他們也必然要鼓勵小民去效法他崇仰他。我在這裏所要說的「目蓮戲」，自然也是具有這同一不健全的内容：不過在劇本編製及演出形式上比較地要詳細得多，有刺激得多罷了。</p>
<p>現在我想先從這劇本的故事和結構講起。我們先不妨考察一下京戲中的「目蓮救母」和「滑油山」這兩齣戲的故事，因爲這是有連帶關係的。目蓮的父親傅員外是一個素來行善的人，一天在門前看見一個和尙，在吃一個化來的蘿蔔。他還未吃完就倒地而死了。傅員外就拿出錢來棺殮了他。後夫人劉氏夜裏又夢見那和尙，不久遂產一子，就也取名「蘿蔔」。後來員外去世了，兒子「蘿蔔」出家了，劉氏痛行善者家破人亡，乃憤而開齊破戒，打僧駡道，喝酒茹葷，把葷油獻上佛堂，拆毁萬緣橋，行種種與善相反的事。冥王得知大怒，不差鬼使把劉氏拿到地府，使歷受刀山。劍樹，油鍋，血池，滑油山的種種苦痛。再說蘿蔔出家後，遇到佛祖，佛祖爲取法名目蓮，頗有道行；因孝思頗重，乃挑經尋母，後悉母死後在地獄受苦，乃往幽冥救母，曾遍遊十殿，過十八地獄，最後到酆都城，母子始得相會。「目蓮救母」這齣戲通常只演在酆都母子相會一段，「滑油山」也只演劉氏將到滑油山受苦一段；而「目蓮戲」却是原原本本的演，情節比上面所說的還要複雜。「目蓮戲」先從傅員外的窮時演起，後演到他發達高升爲宰相，及其種種善行，以及死後升入天堂等等。寫劉氏的無惡不作是更爲刺激的，其虐待僧道，殘殺性畜，及其凶悍潑辣之處，演來眞是維妙維肖，活靈活現。地獄中的種種痛苦，如油煎，鑄蓋，過奈何橋及刀山，劍樹之類，都實地佈置在舞台上，令人看了驚心動魄。可見「目蓮戲」的故事和結搆，較之京戲中的「目蓮救母」之類是要詳細而且緊密得多了。</p>
<p>「目蓮戲」的演出規模也是很大的。「目蓮戲」一共有七大本，三十餘齣，要七天七夜才能演完。一天一夜演一本應給演者百元左右的戲銀，還須供給伙食。演七天七夜大團圓勢非七百元不辦。再加上别的開銷，一台目蓮戲花費近千元眞是極爲平常的。</p>
<p>我們再從需要的演員人數及演技方面來看，「目蓮戲」的演出規模和京戲的「目蓮救母」也不可同日而語。「目蓮戲」每塲最少的人數要兩個，塲面大的要數十人至百餘人不等。最後大團圓一塲演員可增至二百餘人，在中國的民間演劇中恐怕很少能看得見這樣巨大的塲面吧？演技方面，演員的特别能力也足以令人驚歎。演出重表情，喜怒哀樂，危險緊張，都行刻劃入微，悲哀時得眞流眼淚，受難時要做得眞像身臨其境一般。這都還是至爲平常的。此外，有的人還得練就（或謂神助）一種武藝，有如賣藝人似的，能在一定的距離内飛刀至另一演員頭部的周遭，而不傷害其人。敎人學戲的老師父還有一套本領，就是正戲還未開演前，他須唸唸有詞地作一套法術，將一歪倒在地下的竹竿，令其自行豎立起來。這種現象跡近神奇迷信，但我們至今仍不能完滿解釋這種現象。像這類神怪的事在「目蓮戲」演出過程中頗多，現在我不妨再舉出兩件事來作爲例子；</p>
<p>（一）「尋宅」丨演「目蓮戲」的目的是酬神，娛樂不過是一種副作用。凡人有病都可許願唱「目蓮戲」，就是病人死了也還是要唱。「尋宅」就是演員中飾文太師的一個人，赴酬神人家的供桌前念咒驅鬼出「宅」。這一天，酬神人家必須素食，不得賭博同房及爲不端之事，否則將有災禍來臨。文太師作法時，若口訥不能流利說話，則此家本年將必有禍事發生，此時闔家大小必須環跪於其左右，以求减輕禍害。文太師臉上的金粉，下裝後可賣到三四元錢。</p>
<p>（二）「癱五猖」丨唱「目蓮戲」時，台下供五處五猖神的神座，在演的當時，設若有一處倒了下來，則必有人昏迷癱瘓，不能言語，這時就須請老師父來施法，方可痊愈。痊愈後，須給老師傅一二十元的酬金，作爲謝儀。</p>
<p>自然，這些都不免是近乎神話的荒唐把戲，我個人不相信眞有這種怪事，但因爲民智低下，又因這種戲的深入人心，酬神人家總是必恭必敬，小心將事的進行他們的迷信工作的。</p>
<p>因爲目蓮戲演唱花費的浩大，窮苦人家當然唱不起，但害病特多的是窮苦人，他們也要「許願」唱戲的，於是就有一種「小戲」發生。這類似一種傀儡戲，不過這裏用的是菩薩的偶象而不是傀儡。演出法是由演「目蓮戲」者把菩薩偶像持於手中演之，自作自唱。這種辦法花費較少，每次出二十元左右卽可。這種「小戲」也能「尋宅」趕鬼。</p>
<p>相傳這種「目蓮戲」是明朝劉基（卽劉伯溫）編的，現流行於安徽的宣城，面陖，涇縣，太平等幾縣。蕪湖的鄕下和徽州各縣也有演唱「目蓮戲」的。外省若江蘇的宜興，浙江的紹興等地，據說也有一種「目蓮戲」，不過我不曉得其演出方式和我上面所說的是否相同。劉基本來是浙江靑田縣人，曾爲明太祖聘至金陵，佐太祖成帝業甚有功，其所作本有流傳至皖南，蘇南，浙東之可能，不過現在民間關於劉伯溫的神話太多了，這種「目蓮戲」的作者及其起源的說法，是不是出於附會，却也是我們應該懷疑而値得更進一步去加以考證的。</p>
<h3>旅行一周回鄕記（四）</h3>
<p>— 蘇鋼</p>
<p>他說着皺了一會眉頭，又伸長了脖子在船上的篾摺上來回地忙了一陣。</p>
<p>在三十多個人的精疲力靈之後，這隻龐大的怪物才算離開南昌了；這時，天上巳湧起一層層的雲塊，爛棉絮似的裹着將要没落的太陽，所映着水面連成一條赤紅的光彩，我看到這當前的江景，不覺想起王勃的「秋水共長天一色」這一句的佳妙。</p>
<p>幾天的旅途勞頓，換來了一夜美妙的夢景；第二天一时醒來，身上所有的疲乏好像偷跑了一半了。</p>
<p>船夫見我起了身，便忙着搯了一盆洗臉水進來說：「你老！我們個裏没有熱水，你老將就點罷！」</p>
<p>我朝那木面盆裏看了看，不覺搖了搖頭，逼着氣胡亂地洗了一下。</p>
<p>船夫把洗臉水拿去倒了，接着又端進飯來；一碗盛着乾癟癟的辣椒，一碗裏盡是榖粒的糙米飯，他一樣一樣替我擺好，便陪着笑向我說，「你老自己有菜吧！我們個裏就祗有個個菜吃，一直吃到上饒才掉換哩！」</p>
<p>「你們天天吃個個，吃得來麽？」</p>
<p>「不吃個個菜，没有菜吃啊！你老，請快吃罷，到前面要下水了。」他說着又裂開嘴笑了。</p>
<p>「下水？」我驚訝的問。</p>
<p>「是啊！你老没坐過個個船吧？怪不得，坐個個船總要下水的。」他還是那麽滿不在乎的說着。</p>
<p>等我一頓飯還没有吃完那會功夫，就聽到船老板在跳板上喊着伙計，說：「快點吃啊！前面的灘到了；快快請客人下船哪！」</p>
<p>許多船夫一聲吆喝，頓時又忙亂起來；一忽兒送飯的船夫又進來催着說：「飯吃好了吧，你老？前面的灘就到了哩！」</p>
<p>「個怎麽辦呢？個冷天下水，不是要命嗎？」我遲疑地滿含着不願的神氣說。</p>
<p>「你老，個没有法子，船載得太重了！你看！前面那幾位客人不都下去了嗎！」他滿臉堆着苦笑，身子却也彈琴般地抖着。</p>
<p>我看着他那寒酸的神情，又望了望那已經站在水裏的幾個客人，心裏不覺便軟了下來；自已告了一因奮勇，把下身的衣服全脫光了，跟着船夫走上船頭，慢慢地滑下水去。</p>
<p>這隻龐大的怪物，已經走乏了似的停在那裏喘着，水澄清得連一根針都可尋得出來，河底下鵝蛋大小似的石頭，印到水面，像一塊水晶玻璃的圖案。</p>

<h3>英國大文學家斯提文生名著「金銀島」搬上銀幕的過程</h3>
<p>在清潔運動聲中，好萊塢的製片公司，爲防止電影檢查會和宗敎團體的爲難，而把歷史上的事蹟和文學作品作題材而攝上銀幕，當然是最聰明的方法。因此，最近在上海各影戲院中，我們已見過幾張文學作品攝的影片，像描寫大詩人白朗寗的「閨怨」，大仲馬的「基度山恩仇記」奧司特洛夫斯基的「雷雨」等片，而最近，南京又要公映斯提文生的「金銀島」了。</p>
<p>「金銀島」的内容，完全以海盜爲描寫的主體，最初這個故事是作者講給他兩個孩子聽的，可是也版而後，竟成了文學名著，直到現在，還是爲各國讀者所歡迎。現在斯提文生描寫海盜生知活的「金銀島」，已由米高美公司採作劇本的題材而搬上銀幕，攝成聲片，由華雷斯此萊要賈克柯柏兩明星主演。斯提文生的兩個孩子一個呌魯意奧斯勃垷在也已成了有名的作家，還有一個呌伊索奧斯勃，現在已是戲劇作家和電影劇本作家沙里斑斐爾特的夫人了，「金銀島」也許便由他們而產生的。</p>
<p>斯提文生是一個多病的文人。當他到法國去靜養的一回那時他已成了作家，在法國齊巧和加利佛尼亞的奧斯勃夫人會見了，後來他們便結婚。斯提文生不久便到加利佛尼亞更曾一度住居於加利斯多加和蒙脫利兩地。在蒙脫利，他更曾寫成不少作品。當他在加利佛尼亞的時候，便把「金銀島」這個故事，講給他兩個奧斯白夫人前夫所生的孩子聽，這故事接着一八八三年在倫敦出版，立刻成了不朽的傑作；現在，把這不朽的傑作，搬上銀幕，爲了這故事的讀者，至少有一萬萬人以上而讀過的人，已都有深刻的印象，所以對於攝製方面，自然非審愼不可，而導演維史多弗萊鉛VictorFleming，事前便很謹愼的處理一切。</p>
<p>編劇約翰李馬興把「金銀島」編成劇本，也很忠實的使劇本不夫原意，尤其是對話和動作的描寫。導演在「金銀島」中也並不注重使一張影片的情調完全以動作爲根據，而却力使依照斯提文生所描寫的。當「金銀島」在攝製的時候，對於佈景方面，也特别注意，因爲每一個讀過「金銀島」原本的觀衆，對於斯提文生所描寫的「蘋果桶的内形」，「木柵的圍子」，「財寳的發現」，「希斯派諾拉船的探險」都有深刻的印象，遺留在腦際，所以段景的處理要格外的留意呢！</p>
<p>在「金銀島」這張影片之中，當初在攝製的時候，關於海盜生活的風光，一切的道具，像火器，短刀，槍砲，和其他用具，都由達華脫弗蘭克林設計的，弗蘭克林一向任職於紐約博物院是美國當代一個描寫海盜小說的有名作家。也許「金銀島」在銀幕上公映的時候，每個讀者，在孩提時代，所幻想過的「金銀島」中的夢幻什麽都現實了。在影片中，由華雷斯皮萊攝海盜，賈克柯柏攝少年，里昂巴里穆亞飾老船長，此外不重要的配角，還有百人之多。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「重婚」丨丨新光</h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>美國電影在中國眞是影響不小，這是大家所共認的。（重婚）雖不是整個的由於美國電影的脫胎，但是有若干部份却是受了美國電影之影響的。我們看過「田園風月」或其他取材於農村的美國電影，劇作者常將鄕村的純樸和都市的罪惡對立起來，結果使人們依戀着麗的田園，而對於罪惡淵數的都市深惡痛恨。自然，這並不是正確的觀念，而「重婚」在這一點上是和「田園風月」初無二致的。</p>
<p>不，「重婚」生要的主題並不在這地方，劇作者所要表現的是可憐而愚昧的老農夫，生了一個兒子不學好，只落得家破人散，凄慘得很。但是在另一方而說，我們不妨反省一下，假使高占非那個角色，並没有在野鷄大學讀書，（自然劇作者對於敎育的不良，學校的腐敗，是深深的針砭了一下的。）他似乎是可以讀書成名而且要做官的，這樣便不致於使老父失望，而且是父親將由老農一變而爲老太爺了。這一點，大槪是劇作者預料所不及的反作用。</p>
<p>此外，我們在這影片裏面是不必再指出更偉大的意義的，可憐的是那老富農，一心想靠兒子爭氣翻身，可是運氣不好，兒子不爭氣，有什麽辦法呢？至於四千元運動做官，大門貼了封條，後門仍可自由出入，都是很眞實的寫照了</p>
<p>「重婚」的導演，在「風」中已經顯出了若干奇特的天才，在這裏又展示了優秀的枝巧。他很清楚明快的叙述了故事，他將劇的空氣處理得很好，調子也很適當。也許有人說其中或過於誇之處，如謝雲卿到了兒子的寓所，接觸了一切繁華和奢侈，太做作了一點，又如對於高倩蘋的脾氣也寫得過火一點，都使人覺得是在看戲而已。</p>
<p>不成問題，這一影片的導演·是我們觀衆期望甚殷的優秀的人材。然而優秀的表現，是從内容到形式的統一，不是技術單方面可以存在的，即是說導演得在整個的作品上以决定他的成功。反之，優秀的技巧不表現偉大而充實的内容，其成功亦不在聰明的畫匠之上。</p>
<p>最後，以嚴月孄扮演交際花之流，那是再勝任也不過的。高占非夫婦却平平盡職。攝影的優秀，增加了畫面的美感不少。</p>
<h3>評「靑雲得路」</h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>ThePursuitHappiness</p>
<p>丨丨大光明</p>
<p>在感覺所謂題材缺乏的時候，從小說或者戲劇方面，採取現成的題材，已經成爲好萊塢最方便的方法。這「靑雲得路」又是一部由改編舞台劇本而來的</p>
<p>因爲是脫胎於舞台劇的原故，總不免受着原著的影響，如最後那一塲，因着一個軍官的出現，使幾重的困難，一切的糾紛，都得以消滅。這種取巧的方法，自然不是現代劇上經常可以發現的。</p>
<p>作爲一個輕鬆的喜劇而搬演，在銀幕上未嘗没有相當的成功。輕巧，流利一，明快，使人們發生自然的快感。這對认一般疲倦了而需要消遣的人們，自然是很合口味的。</p>
<p>但是由於故事的决定，這裏除了做到了輕快之感而外，却是没有其他長處的。華盛頓時代的喜劇，對於我們眞是太生疏了，卽使它是正確的反應那一時代的眞實，然而也没有給與我們眞切而清晣的槪念。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>談「桃李刧」中的演員</h3>
<p>— 競益</p>
<p>「桃李刦」已經在金城公映了，關於意識，技巧，以及結構等，連日各報的影刋上均已刋載了，成功與否，自有公正的批評，用不着我再多說，我這裏就來談談初次從舞台轉上銀幕的幾位重要演員吧。</p>
<p>被人譽爲「小天使」的陳波兒，我還記得她曾在「西綫無戰事」中扮演妹妹，當時就給與我很好的影象，我認她是一個極有希望的人。果然，在「桃李刦」中，證明我的話，並非虚話。在本片中，她飾表妹黎麗琳，從一個活潑的處女，轉變到婦人的態度，處女時的嬌羞和天眞，以及結婚後產子時的疲倦和困乏，都是相當的成功，而從樓梯上失足墮下的一幕，尤其是非常逼眞。</p>
<p>袁枚之是辛酉劇社，和戲劇恊社的社員，我曾在「努吼吧中國」演出時見過他。在本片中，他飾主角陶建平，自始至終，都是非常努力。從畢業後到入獄，中間的過程，他都在聲浪，化裝，表演上，加重悲劇的成分，助長全劇的進展。</p>
<p>唐槐秋是話劇界的老前輩，他曾創辦過很多劇社，也曾主演過「蘇州夜話」「女店主」等名劇。在本片中，他飾劉校長，一副老人的風度，不减「蘇州作話」中的老畫師。他的面部表情，他的沈着，動作，以及他的聲浪，無一處不吻合劇中人的身份。</p>
<p>周伯勳素來是以表演富商或紳士著名的，過去曾主演「阿萊城的姑娘」等。在「桃李刦」中，飾一個好色的經理，那種使人厭惡而可笑的表情，在滑稽中帶着諷刺，也是很好的。</p>
<h3>關於「再生花」</h3>
<p>— 火</p>
<p>「再生花」是「姊妹花」的續集，是鄭正秋的一年一度的心血傑作。</p>
<p>「再生花」的劇情，比「姊妹花」更沉痛動人，吏曲折婉轉。</p>
<p>在這兒有一幕：大寳被二寳從牢獄裏救出來而回到自己家裏，她正替桃哥兒在洗傷換藥，突然小張來通知大帥已派兵來抓她的消息，可憐一家人只得起身慌慌張張地逃難，趙大媽因爲自己是老病之身，行動極爲困難，所以她不願因睚己而累及大寳等，拼命地呌大寳桃哥先逃，自己情願落後，可是大寳和桃哥又那裏會答應，但是趙大媽一定要她們先走，結果大家痛哭在一起而被捕了，當您看了這一幕時，您的心兒不得不急，不病，而使您要簌簌地流下眼淚來。（却）</p>

<h3>金蓮刧（Have　a　Heart）（五）</h3>
<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>明天一早，吉梅帶了莎麗的狗，去送還莎麗。莎麗想不到他來得那麽早，她看見梅進來，急急要將她的脚藏在衣服下面，但是已經來不及了。她很羞慚地說道：「眞是想不到，你來得這麽早。我本來不願你知道的。」吉梅笑着安慰她道：「哦，哦，哦，哦。你非但相貌像安琪兒，並且說話都像安琪兒」他過去將她摟住了。莎麗亦就重新快活起來了。但是她的快活是很短促的。門外忽然有人在敲着門。莎麗去將門開了，一個呌麥克的人走了進來。他就是昨天將汽車借結吉梅的人。麥克看見了吉梅，就告訴他昨夜公司被盜，現在警察正在捉他哩。吉梅聽了他的話，因爲自己本來坦白無私，所以也就不肯逃，靜等自警察尋到這理來。一回兒，果然公司的經理孝勃爾，帶着警察尋了來。孝勃爾告訴吉梅，要是他將錢賠了出來，他可以不加追究的。吉梅辯白着他没有盜竊公司裏的錢，但是警察們不由分說，就將吉梅帶了去，將他關起來了。莎麗看着吉梅被警察帶了去，不覺心痛如絞。她一定要想法子救他。她一定要趕快救他，因爲倘使他被判决了，他就要受兩年的徒刑了。她想了一天一晚，到了明天一早，她就跑到經理先生孝勃爾那裏。她見經理的時候，除了他們兩個人之外，還有經理的秘書漢倫，在一邊整理文件。莎麗在經理面前，懇求着說：「你昨天所說的，要是吉梅將錢從速歸還，你情願不加追究的，是不是？」孝勃爾點着頭。莎麗谥是打開她的皮包，將一大捲鈔票放在桌子上道：「這是四百塊錢……我因爲怕他被判定徒刑……請你特别寬恕他……求你快點設法……將他放了出來吧……求求你……」孝勃爾點點頭。他說：「不錯的。我立即打電話去」。他一面說，一面抓過電話來。莎麗走的時候，面上露出一些笑容。她已經不能去割治她的脚了……他不知道什麽時候，才可以割治，或者永久没有這機會了……但是她却救了吉梅，這是她私衷竊喜的一件事。</p>
<p>在莎麗去見經理先生的時候，瓊和蓋斯兩個人，正在監牢裏探問吉梅。吉梅看見了他們，先是很着急的問著莎麗，後來又問蓋斯道；「你我到那個人没有？」蓋斯道；「我已經找到了那個看夜的人，但是他兩隻手臂上，都没有刺銀元樣子的花紋。」吉梅覺得很奇怪道；「眞的嗎？你看清楚了没有？」蓋斯道；「我怎麽没有看清楚呢。」過了一回，一個警官走了進來，他對着吉梅說，他可以出去散步了，他已經被釋放了。吉梅聽了，快活極了。他立即跑到公司裏，但是一到公司裏，就立刻憤怒起來了，因爲經理先生告訴他，他雖被釋放，但是他的罪名却没有洗掉。吉梅於是就問，誰拿錢來贖他出來的，但是經理不肯告訴他。後來他從漢倫那裏，得到了一些消息，原來是莎麗拿錢，來贖他出來的。結果，漢倫還故意地加了一句；「你說奇怪不奇怪。我從來没有欵心到，你會偷那個錢的。但是莎麗今天來看孝勃爾的時候，她像她倒知道是你偷的。」吉梅跳了起來；「你說莎麗知道是我偷的嗎？」漢倫點點頭道；「當然，我聽她的口氣，就知道了。」吉梅聽了。怒氣勃勃地奔向大門，走了出去。他去追問莎麗去了。他跑到莎麗那裏，惡狠狠地向她追問，是不是她拿出錢來贖他的？莎麗露着很可憐的樣子道；「錢是我拿出來的但是我以爲···」吉梅狂喊着道；「你使得人人都相信我是一個竊賊···人人都那麽　。你自己都相信的。」莎麗連忙和他爭辯道；「不，不，不。没有的事。」（未完）</p>

<h3>Dorle's Family Treasure Dragon Eye Pearl Falls Into Foreign Hands</h3>
<p>(Peiping) At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, Vietnam presented a pearl that prolongs life, also known as the Dragon Eye Pearl. It is yellow with black spots in the middle, resembling a dragon's eye, weighing about 1.8 mace. During the reign of Prince Regent Dorle at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the Qing court used this pearl as a reward. After more than a generation, his descendants regarded it as a family treasure and wore it on the side of their navel, which had the effect of prolonging life. Therefore, several generations of Prince Rui lived to be 80 or 90 to 100 years old. The descendants of Prince Rui sold this pearl after the eighth or ninth year of the Republic of China when their family fortune declined. A French pearl merchant offered a price of 120,000, but the descendants of Prince Rui did not sell it because the pearl was priceless. They used it as collateral for 50,000 yuan at an American bank in Tianjin for a period of five years. Now that the term has expired, the descendants of the king have been unable to redeem it and have sold it to the American bank for 80,000 yuan. It has now been shipped to the United States. It is a pity that national treasures are gradually flowing out. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Banning Students from Dancing</h3>
<p>By Ji</p>
<p>For the past two months, many people in Shanghai have advocated banning students from dancing. The University Federation initiated the proposal, and celebrities such as Kong Xiangxi and Wang Zhengting have voiced their support. Not only do university faculty and staff have organizations for self-improvement in order to promote the trend, but also the students of the universities that bear the brunt have organizations such as the "University Students' Revival Movement Promotion Association." The association's declaration, while making some clarifications regarding university students' entry into dance halls, still expresses agreement with the principle of banning dancing. Recently, the municipal education authorities have taken further measures, namely submitting a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Concession authorities to order all dance halls in the concession areas not to admit students for dancing. Personnel dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Council and French Municipal Council will join forces with personnel dispatched by the Education Bureau to conduct on-site investigations and bans at various dance halls. Once discovered, the school will be notified immediately to expel the student and disallow transfer to another school. This shows that past efforts to ban students from dancing have not achieved significant results, so they want to redouble their efforts to reverse the declining social atmosphere.</p>
<p>During their time of schooling, students who lightly enter dance halls, listen to lewd music, and see seductive sights not only waste their studies but also damage their morality. As a result, they are precocious in physiology and immature in knowledge. Even if they manage to graduate, how can they support themselves and establish their lives, let alone shoulder heavy responsibilities and have a long-term vision? If the people's lives in a country during times of peace are all indulged in licentiousness, it is enough to reverse prosperity and lead to decline. Moreover, at this time of severe national crisis and imminent national peril, it is even more heartbreaking to see many students immersed in song and dance halls, unaware of the need to work hard and improve themselves. It is indeed a matter of course and righteousness not to be tolerant and permissive of this, and in principle, there is no room for criticism.</p>
<p>Today, Shanghai can be said to be the place with the most dance halls and the most popular dance craze in the country. Young people in general are most easily confused by their nature and deviate from the norm when placed in a bad environment. Taking university students as an example, while there are many who are law-abiding, there are also those who yearn for the dazzling lights and intoxicating pleasures of the dance halls, or who are tempted and eager to try. Although it is said that the way to remedy the situation is to enrich the content of the schools, promote proper entertainment and recreation, tighten the curriculum, pay attention to moral education, and even limit students' finances, it is still difficult to implement in reality. Putting out a fire by pouring soup on it is not as effective as removing the firewood from under the pot. Rather than solely assigning responsibility to the schools and students, it is faster to actually stop it in the dance halls as well. This time, the municipal education bureau's proposal to send personnel to investigate and ban is a groundbreaking measure. Although it may not be easy to be universally implemented in a short period of time, it can punish one as a warning to a hundred, making students who like to dance feel apprehensive. If this measure can be carried out consistently with the cooperation of the concession authorities, it will greatly benefit all students in Shanghai. Most of the famous dance halls in Shanghai are located in the concessions, beyond the authority of our municipal authorities. If we truly want to ban young students from dancing in the future, we must obtain the joint support of the concession administrative organs. We also deeply feel that the councils and public bureaus of the concessions also have an inescapable duty in this regard. Although the dance craze in Shanghai came from Europe, all European and American countries have strict prohibitions on young students entering dance halls and order dance halls to refuse to admit students. In recent years, the dance craze in Japan has also been very popular. As of August of this year, its metropolitan police department also issued an order banning students from entering dance halls and cafes. The intention is nothing more than to prevent the negative impact on young people's actual lives. Now, residents in the Shanghai concessions, regardless of Chinese or foreign, all bear the obligation to pay taxes. Chinese people pay even more taxes. Even if the concession authorities are unable to broadly establish schools at all levels to nurture the children of our country's residents for a time, how can they sit idly by and allow them to go astray without correcting them? We hope very much that they can be happy to agree with the demands of our Shanghai municipal authorities.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance is Considering Whether to Retain or Abolish the Salt Commissioner System</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The system of salt commissioners and deputy commissioners has been maintained according to the old system, managing the salt tickets, increased production, and transportation in the producing areas. Non-producing areas are handled by the salt transport bureau. Since the salt affairs inspection office has been expanded, its powers overlap with those of the salt commissioner and deputy commissioner. The central government, considering that the administrative expenses for salt affairs far exceed the principle, has ordered the Ministry of Finance to deliberate. It is said that the Ministry of Finance is considering whether to retain or abolish the salt commissioner system and may decide on a comprehensive plan by the Salt Affairs Reform Committee in the future.

<h3>Serious Situation Between Russia and the Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>Competing for a Small Island South of Dongning</p>
<p>Armies Confronting Each Other, Ready to Erupt</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Russian Soldiers Building Trenches Captured</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to today's Harbin Times, a major dispute has arisen between Russia and "Manchuria." After the island of Dahe on the border line flooded this summer, the river channel changed, forming a small island south of Dongning Town on the east and west borders. The Soviet authorities claimed that the island should belong to Russia and built a guardhouse on the island, stationing troops to guard it. The commander-in-chief of the "Manchurian" border defense forces protested to the commander-in-chief of the Russian army in Boli, who replied that the island belonged to Soviet Russia. The "Manchurian" commander-in-chief then deployed troops along the border, cutting off the island's transportation with Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia also transferred troops from Shuangchengbao to confront the "Manchurian" troops, and several Soviet Russian aircraft were engaged in reconnaissance of the "Manchurian" troop positions near the island.

<h3>US Prepares to Increase Defenses in the Pacific After Naval Negotiations Fail</h3>
<p>Congressional Members Plan to Introduce Bill</p>
<p>Establish Invincible Naval Port in Alaska</p>
<p>Government Still Hopes for Compromise with Japan Despite Restraint</p>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today from reliable sources that the United States still hopes to conclude a new naval treaty within 1936. Senior government officials solemnly stated that although the United States is disappointed with the results of the initial talks in London, it still believes that future circumstances may be conducive to extending the naval treaty. The government does not intend to say much or take any action to provoke other countries' animosity towards the naval issue. Those close to the government indicate that now is not the appropriate time for Americans to harshly criticize the actions of other countries involved in the naval dispute, fearing that this would provoke retaliatory criticism from other countries. The repeated solemn expression of this compromising attitude is intended to offset the blunt expressions of congressional members and the discussion of establishing naval bases after Japan announced its abrogation of the naval treaty. (National Telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today that the next session of Congress will recommend the construction of an invincible port and powerful military and air stations in Alaska. This proposal was put forward by Representative Dimond of Alaska in the House of Representatives. Dimond announced today that when the next session of Congress convenes, he will introduce two bills requesting congressional approval of appropriations for the construction of land and naval military defenses in the near future. Dimond advocates establishing military and air stations on the Alaskan mainland, far from the sea, so they are beyond the reach of naval artillery. This air base will house at least one hundred aircraft of various types. Dimond also stated that he will request the opening of a powerful naval base in Alaska or the Aleutian Islands. This matter can proceed after Japan abrogates the naval treaty. Dimond further stated that the naval base he proposes will be at least as solid as Pearl Harbor, the American naval fortress in Hawaii. Dimond predicts that his plan will definitely receive the support of a majority of members of Congress. Dimond also advocates digging the Nicaraguan Canal, because the defenses of the Panama Canal are insufficient. (National Telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) American public opinion generally believes that after Japan's abrogation of the Washington Treaty, the United States will no longer be bound by Article 19 of the treaty, which prohibits increasing defenses in the Pacific. The question of whether the Philippines should be independent will also be raised in conjunction. Although the government has remained silent on this issue, it is generally known that the government has always recognized that political and military issues in the Pacific are closely related. In addition, some liberals in the United States have another argument that while increasing American national defense is necessary, if it is only used as a means to implement the Open Door Policy in China by developing the American navy, it is feared that the United States will be constrained and fall into a dangerous path. Conversely, it would be a big mistake for people to think that the Chinese market is insignificant to American interests. It is now believed that Yamamoto, the chief Japanese expert, will not stay in London for long. He may not be able to make Britain succumb to Japan's views. On the contrary, a compromise between Britain and the United States is currently even closer. It is also generally believed that Germany and the Soviet Union will be invited to attend the next formal naval conference to jointly participate in talks on Pacific issues.

<h3>Two Telegrams Issued from Tokyo</h3>
<p>Unanimity of Matsudaira and Saito</p>
<p>Navy Declares the Main Purpose of Abrogating the Treaty</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota met with the Emperor at 10:35 this morning and submitted a memorial to approve the notification of the abrogation of the Washington Treaty decided by yesterday's cabinet meeting. After obtaining the Emperor's approval, Foreign Minister Hirota immediately sent a telegram to Saito, the Japanese ambassador to the United States, this afternoon, ordering him to hand over the notification to US Secretary of State Hull on the 27th. (United Press of China Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's response to the British proposal was telegraphed by Foreign Minister Hirota to Ambassador Matsudaira at 2:00 pm on the 23rd, instructing him to continue talks with Britain after Christmas. The content directly requests the realization of Japan's disarmament policy and principles. If the British government agrees, then after the resumption of informal meetings or preparatory talks, the British proposal on achieving equality can be considered. The first Anglo-Japanese negotiations after the recess seem to begin on the 27th or 28th of this month. (United Press of Japan Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Domestic procedures for the notification of the abrogation of the Washington Treaty were completed today. Ambassador Saito to the United States was instructed by Foreign Minister Hirota. The Navy, considering today's great significance, issued the following statement in the form of an official statement to domestic and foreign audiences regarding the main purpose of the abrogation:</p>
<p>(1) Thirteen years have passed since the conclusion of the Washington Treaty. During this period, due to scientific progress, warships, weapons, and aircraft have developed extraordinarily, and the international situation has also changed extraordinarily, making it unsuitable for today's situation, and it will cause defects in Japan's future national defense. Therefore, taking the opportunity of the expiration date of Showa 11 (1936), we have decided to terminate the notification of abrogation. Domestic procedures have been completed today. (2) Japan does not expect a treaty-less state from this, but intends to conclude a fair and appropriate new treaty. The national effort to make this known is a well-known fact. At the disarmament conference, Japan earnestly hopes to abolish the ratio between the United States, Britain, and Japan, and set the maximum common amount of possession for each country, attempting to completely abolish or greatly reduce offensive military power, and implement the consolidation of defensive military power, so as to realize the principle of not threatening or invading, and to ensure the security of each country's national defense, so as to contribute to the establishment of world peace, which is sincerely hoped for. (3) In short, the abrogation of the Washington Treaty is for the further advancement of this purpose, and is merely the exercise of the rights under the treaty. (Dentsu Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>France Does Not Join Japan in Its Filth</h3>
<p>Denies Will Announce Abrogation</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Laval specifically and formally denied today that there were rumors that the French government was also planning to follow Japan's example and announce the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty. It is reported that the French government's attitude is that since the treaty has been abrogated by Japan, it no longer exists, so France does not need to formally announce its abrogation. At the same time, it is reported that the French government intends to formally notify the countries concerned of the position that France wants to take in negotiating a new naval treaty. The French Foreign Minister will announce this issue in the Chamber of Deputies in the next few days. (Reuters Telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs and Naval Affairs Committees of the Chamber of Deputies held a joint meeting this afternoon. Foreign Minister Laval and Navy Minister Pietri presented a report on the diplomatic situation after Japan announced the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty. The two cabinet members explained that the French government will make contact in order to retain the French government's views, so as to serve as a basis for future negotiations. After the Foreign Minister and Navy Minister gave their presentations, a debate was held. The representatives repeatedly stated that when the 1923 Washington Naval Treaty was submitted to Congress for approval, both houses wanted the treaty to cease to be effective at its first expiration date, in accordance with Article 23 of the treaty (i.e., December 31, 1936). This intention is obvious. The two committees expressed their approval of the statements of the two ministers. (Havas Telegram on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Japan Establishes National Policy Deliberation Council to Deal with Emergencies</h3>
<p>Begins Drafting Concrete Plan</p>
<p>Political Support and Opposition Attitudes</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the meeting of Finance Minister Takahashi, Commerce Minister Machida, and Communications Minister Tokonami, the problem of establishing the National Policy Deliberation Council was decided as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The National Policy Deliberation Council is an organization for establishing national policy with the consensus of the whole country. (2) The National Policy Deliberation Council is a permanent organization. (3) If a person with authority is appointed as a long-term member, a powerful national policy will be established. (4) The National Policy Deliberation Council will establish important national policies in various fields such as national defense, diplomacy, finance, economy, and industry. (5) A specialized committee will be established, attached to the National Policy Deliberation Council, and will gather authorities from various ministries as its members. (United Press of Japan Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The outline of the concrete plan for the National Policy Deliberation Council is as follows: (1) The Prime Minister will serve as the chairman of the council, and the members will be senior statesmen, representatives of both houses of parliament, and 12 or 13 major figures from the financial and academic communities. It will serve as a consultation organization for finance, administration, and economy. (2) A large-scale investigation organization will be established within the deliberation council, with 40 or 50 authoritative figures as members, to be responsible for investigation and research. Yoshida, Chief Secretary, and Kanamori, Director-General of the Legislation Bureau, have begun drafting a concrete plan. (Reuters Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai is paying close attention to the government's establishment of the National Policy Deliberation Council. The attitude of the executives is generally as follows: Diplomacy and national defense should be operated according to the policies of Foreign Minister Hirota and Army Minister Hayashi. At a time when external criticism cannot be tolerated, setting up a deliberation council is only a mechanism for the government to evade responsibility, and on the contrary, there is a risk of causing political operations to fall into error. The purpose of the government's eagerness to set up this organization is to disrupt the Seiyukai, so the Seiyukai will continue its policy of not sending cabinet members to the current cabinet. Those who participate in the deliberation council through individual negotiations will be expelled. (Dentsu Telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Immigrant Plan for the Northeast</h3>
<p>Founding Company Jointly Operated by Japan and Puppets</p>
<p>Capital Set at 50 Million</p>
<p>United Press of China Changchun Dispatch: The Kwantung Army Special Service Department held an immigration meeting at the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Changchun in late November. As a result, it was believed that Japanese immigration had the possibility of success, and the immigration policy was re-established, canceling all past small-scale plans. It is reported that the newly established plan is as follows: (1) A special company with a capital of 50 million yuan will be jointly operated by Japan and the puppets. The Japanese government will pay 20 million yuan, and Manchukuo will provide land (confiscated from civilian fields) at an old price of 10 million yuan. The remaining 20 million yuan will be accepted and paid by the East Asia Development and the Oriental Colonization companies. The Japanese government will guarantee the capital paid by the two companies. (2) The estimated number of immigrants is set at 250,000 people in 25 years, that is, an average of 10,000 people per year.

<h3>Truth of the Kirov Case Comes to Light</h3>
<p>The Murderer is a Member of a Terrorist Group</p>
<p>Purpose is to Overthrow the Current Government</p>
<p>Trotskyists are the Initiators</p>
<p>(Moscow) Officials here announced today that Nikolaiyev, the murderer of Kirov, and thirteen people related to the Zinoviev opposition party have been sent to military institutions and the Supreme Court for disposition, charged with conspiring to assassinate Central Executive Committee member Kirov. Kirov was regarded by many as Stalin's right-hand man. The fourteen were also accused of taking terrorist actions against senior Soviet Russian officials in order to overthrow the Soviet Russian government, that is, hoping to replace Stalin with Trotsky and Zinoviev to control the Soviet Russian government. Zinoviev was arrested on Thursday at the same time as Kamenev, and is now in custody. Kamenev was also a former leader of the Communist Party. The government stated today that the fourteen people who were arrested had all been expelled from the Communist Party, but several of them, such as Zinoviev and Miganiev, were allowed to participate in party affairs again after renouncing their opposition. Among them, Zinoviev was the most prominent. Zinoviev was newly appointed as Deputy Minister of Education a few days before his arrest. Zinoviev had been expelled twice before for supporting Trotsky. (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Soviet Russian Dictator Stalin has suggested to France that Trotsky be expelled, because Trotsky initiated various rebellions, and the assassination of Kirov was only the beginning of his conspiracy. This news was telegraphed to London by the Daily Express correspondent in Warsaw. The telegram also stated that Stalin will personally interrogate Zinoviev, the former Secretary-General of the Third International, Kamenev, the former Soviet Russian Ambassador to Turkey, and the other twelve people who were arrested in connection with the assassination of Kirov. The telegram went on to say that the trial is about to be held, and if the arrested people are proven guilty, they will all be executed by firing squad. (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The preliminary hearing of the Kirov assassination case ended yesterday. The various materials have been handed over to the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union. The preliminary hearing proved that Nikolaiyev, the murderer of Kirov on December 1, was a member of a secret terrorist group. The group was established in Leningrad, and its members were all former Zinoviev oppositionists. Nikolaiyev committed the murder in order to execute the instructions issued by the "Leningrad Center" of the secret terrorist group. The instructions were issued by the leader of the center, Kotolinov. The preliminary hearing proved that the motive for Kirov's murder was that the secret anti-Soviet group wanted to disintegrate the leadership of the Soviet government through the assassination of Soviet government leaders, thereby changing the current policy according to the so-called "Zinoviev-Lenin-Trotskyism". According to the murderer's confession, Kirov's assassination also had a retaliatory intent, because Kirov was the one who theoretically and politically destroyed the Leningrad Zinoviev faction. Nikolaiyev confessed, "In the past, the opposition always wanted to take his life because Kirov presided over the struggle against the anti-Leningrad opposition." The preliminary hearing also proved that this anti-Soviet group was extremely weak, and had despaired of gaining popular support, and had no political outlet. They were adopting terrorist means because they could not achieve their goals. The "Leningrad Center" of the secret terrorist group included members Kotolinov, Shatsky, Lunyantuv, Mandelshtamm, Misnikov, Levin, Susitsky, and Nikolaiyev. They were all former Zinoviev oppositionists. In addition, Sokolov, Svetlov, Yustkin, Antonov, Hannik, and Tolmachev were also arrested, and have been sent to the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union for investigation in accordance with the orders of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. The above-mentioned figures had all been expelled from the party for participating in the activities of the Zinoviev opposition in the past, but most of them regained their party membership after formally declaring their willingness to obey the party and the policies of the Soviet government. The murderer Nikolaiyev was expelled from the party in early 1934 for violating party rules. Two months later, Nikolaiyev rejoined the party after repenting. (TASS Telegram on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Walwal Belongs to Abyssinian Territory</h3>
<p>Explicit Stipulation in the Italo-Abyssinian Treaty</p>
<p>Abyssinian Minister to France Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Paris) – The Abyssinian Legation in France recently issued a statement asserting that the Walwal region, where the Italo-Abyssinian military conflict occurred, is not part of Italian Somaliland as claimed by the Italian side. According to the Italo-Abyssinian Treaty of 1908, Walwal is designated as part of the Abyssinian territory of the Ogaden province. Walwal is located in the center of Ogaden province, 400 kilometers from the coast, while the border of Italian Somaliland extends only to 300 kilometers from the coast. Therefore, it is clear that the area falls within Abyssinian territory. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Chinese Silver Exports to the US</h3>
<p>No Reduction Seen in the First Half of This Month</p>
<p>(Washington) – The Associated Press learned today that silver-supporting legislators from Western states are currently considering the possibility of a Congressional investigation into the Treasury Department's implementation of the Silver Purchase Act of 1934. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr.'s failure to disclose the extent of the Treasury Department's silver purchases in the international silver market has aroused suspicion among silver-supporting legislators, who believe that the Treasury Department has not been diligent in purchasing silver. However, the Congressional consensus on the silver issue will not take concrete form until other leaders arrive. Several senators who have arrived in Washington today stated that the demand for this investigation is unlikely to materialize, because there is internal disagreement among silver supporters. However, three prominent silver-supporting legislators are determined to challenge the Treasury Department and advocate that the Treasury Department should report to Congress on matters related to the following points: (1) the extent of silver purchases to date; (2) the impact of silver purchases on the economy; (3) the cost of silver purchases to date; (4) whether silver has been sold to curb rising silver prices. The Department of Commerce announced today that silver imports for the week ending December 14 showed a sharp decline compared to the previous week. Silver imports for this period amounted to only $1,244,949, compared to $2,053,501 for the week ending December 7. China remains the largest supplier of silver, providing $342,130 for this period, compared to $9,334 for the previous week. Chile is the second-largest supplier of silver, providing $328,858 for this period, compared to $86,463 for the previous week. Imports from Mexico amounted to $206,725, imports from Canada amounted to $161,217, and silver imports from the United Kingdom were minimal, whereas they were substantial in the previous week.

<h3>Cause of Dutch Plane Crash</h3>
<p>Mistaken Landing in a Swamp During a Thunderstorm</p>
<p>Aircraft Completely Destroyed, Seven Killed</p>
<p>Basra – Although the remains of passengers and crew of the Dutch aircraft are fragmented, they are still identifiable. The fuselage overturned and crashed to the ground, irreparably damaged. Letters are scattered around the plane, as the aircraft was carrying Christmas mail from Amsterdam to the Dutch East Indies, with a scheduled round trip of five days. The crash site is in a narrow valley with treacherous rocky mountains, so other aircraft cannot land. Only police vehicles can retrieve the remains. It is now speculated that the Dutch aircraft crashed because it encountered a thunderstorm at high altitude and was forced to land. Initially, it seemed to be landing on solid ground, but after heavy rain, it had become a swamp, and the plane suddenly overturned, broke apart, and caught fire. The mail has now been collected and sent to Rutbah, and the seven bodies on board have been sent to a desert station. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3>A Jurist Discusses the Amount of Appellate Interest in Civil Procedure Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) – The recently passed Article 463 of the Civil Procedure Law by the Legislative Yuan stipulates that the amount of appellate interest shall not exceed 500 yuan and may be increased to 1,000 yuan. According to a jurist, given the general social and economic conditions in China, it would be more appropriate for the amount not to exceed 200 yuan. Taking the amount of property as the standard for enjoying the right of third instance is theoretically untenable. In order to understand the livelihood of the poor in our country, it is not appropriate to further increase the amount of interest.

<h3>Korean People in Peiping Again Injure Police Officers</h3>
<p>Strict Drug Prohibition Causes Hatred Among Koreans</p>
<p>Gathering to Assault Our Police Chief and Officers, etc.</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Since the authorities in this city have strictly prohibited drugs, the Japanese-Korean people who are generally engaged in the business of selling white powder feel that their livelihoods are cut off and are greatly panicked. At first, they still hoped that our Party authorities would implement the ban on opium in the same way as in previous years, with lax enforcement, and that it would become a dead letter after the storm passed. Later, they saw that Chinese people who smoked and sold drugs were arrested and executed without any leniency, and even Korean houses could be inspected together with the Japanese police and arrested separately. Therefore, the drug-trafficking Koreans scattered in the nine cities felt disappointed and harbored hatred. Relying on the protection of the Japanese, they formed a united front, seeking ways to specifically antagonize our national police officers. In recent days, cases of Korean people assaulting police officers have occurred frequently, such as in the inner first district, inner second district, inner third district, and other areas. It is almost heard every day. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided, and another has risen. Yesterday (the 18th) late at night, on the border of the inner fourth district, another bizarre similar case occurred, and Patrol Officer Bai Changhui was severely injured. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Shizhe, a Korean resident at No. 10 Daxi Hutong, Nanshucheng Street, inside Fuchengmen, Peiping, is forty years old. He has been distributing white powder in the western city area for a long time and is considered quite wealthy. He employs many servants in his home, who are responsible for secretly transporting white powder. Since the city authorities</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>implemented drug prohibition, the inner fourth district office immediately dispatched plainclothes detectives to patrol near the residence. If any Chinese people went to buy drugs, they would be arrested and sent to the bureau for legal action. Therefore, addicts generally regarded the residence as a dangerous place. Zhang Shizhe also felt that the authorities were so strict that it was tantamount to cutting off his life. Yesterday (the 18th) at 9 PM, he gathered more than 20 Korean people engaged in the drug trade in his home to discuss how to retaliate. At around 10 PM, two Chinese people happened to go to buy drugs. At this time, Zhang and the other Koreans had already conspired and planned properly. When the two Chinese people entered the house, Zhang immediately ordered all the Koreans and servants in the courtyard to step forward and tie them up. The two Chinese people, still considering themselves as old customers, were suddenly tied up and did not know what to do. Zhang then sent another Korean person to rush to the fourth section police station of the inner fourth district to report that bandits were openly robbing and asked them to come and arrest them. Police Chief Bai Changhui of the section immediately led more than ten police officers, including Cheng Yongli, to the residence to prepare to attack the bandits. Unexpectedly, after arriving at the residence, they saw two Chinese people lying on the ground, bound with ropes, and did not know what was going on. Many Koreans were standing beside them, holding wooden sticks, their expressions fierce. Police Chief Bai then asked Zhang where the bandits were and whether there had been any losses. Zhang not only did not answer but also questioned why the police district had abandoned its duties and did not provide prior protection. When Police Chief Bai was about to reply, Zhang shouted and ordered the Koreans holding wooden sticks to attack Police Chief Bai and all the police officers violently. Fortunately, Police Chief Bai and others understood the law deeply. Considering that the Koreans were foreigners and fearing that they contained a conspiracy to provoke on behalf of a certain party, they agreed to endure and not resist. At the same time, they immediately telegraphed the Public Security Bureau for assistance. At this time, police whistles were ringing loudly, and the police guarding Fuchengmen heard the news and rushed to the scene. Director Liu Zhenzhong also received a report and set off with officers Shi Binglin, clerk Che Junsheng, and many police officers at the same time. However, Police Chief Bai and police officer Cheng Yongli had already fallen to the ground due to injuries and were unconscious. Director Liu immediately questioned the people tied up on the ground. One person, Zhao Changyong, and another person, Xiao Wenying, both claimed to have come to buy white powder on behalf of a friend. Unexpectedly, they were tied up as soon as they entered the door and falsely accused of being robbers, etc. The injured police chief and two police officers had almost no intact skin on their heads, backs, and ribs. Their clothing was also torn. They were immediately carried back to the station for treatment. Zhao and Xiao were also taken to the station for interrogation, suspected of collusion. They were immediately transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It is reported that Yu Jinhe, Director of the Public Security Bureau, considered that the inside story of this case was complex and of great importance. He has submitted the entire case to the Municipal Government in detail and asked for instructions on future drug prohibition and how to deal with the Koreans. (20th)</p>
<h3>Uses of Hubei Provincial Construction Bonds</h3>
<p>To Build Southern and Western Hubei Highways</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Governor Zhang Qun of Hubei Province plans to issue Hubei Provincial Construction Bonds to handle local construction and disaster relief. He sent Finance Director Jia Shiyi to Beijing to contact Minister Kong to discuss the bond amount of 6 million yuan, secured by the entire income from business tax and central government allocations. He also instructed the Finance Department to draft bond regulations and a principal and interest repayment schedule, which were submitted to the Provincial Government meeting for approval and scheduled to be issued on New Year's Day next year. After this plan was submitted to the Executive Yuan, it was sent to the Ministry of Finance for review, clearly stipulating that it would be used to build the Yunzhu, Shiba, and Shiyi highways in western Hubei Province, and the highways connecting Hunan and Jiangxi in southern Hubei Province. It was also scheduled to be issued on New Year's Day next year. According to responsible officials in the Finance Department, these bond regulations still need to be approved by the Central Political Conference and then passed by the Legislative Yuan before they can be promulgated and take effect. There are not many days left before New Year's Day next year. The bond certificates have not yet been printed, so it will be difficult to issue them as scheduled, but the delay will not be too long. The designated highway lines are all related to bandit suppression military affairs. If the construction is completed, the mountainous areas of western Hubei Province can become a thoroughfare, and the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces can be connected. At the same time, disaster victims can be employed for work relief, which is of great benefit. (21st)</p>

<h3>The Chao-Shan Region's Native Sugar Suffers Severe Suppression</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Sells National Sugar</p>
<p>Competing with Farmers' Native Sugar</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The Guangdong Provincial Government's National Products Promotion Office, in order to promote its "Five Rams" brand of national sugar, previously used the pretext of revitalizing native sugar to implement sugar industry control, creating numerous difficulties for native sugar from various districts. Recently, the office issued three temporary measures for the transportation and sale of native sugar, suppressing its circulation. All native sugar transportation and sales must be verified by the national products distribution office and a permit obtained before transportation and sale are allowed. This regulation was implemented on the first of this month. The Pu Ning and Chao Yang native associations in Shantou sent a telegram to the provincial government, stating that the National Products Promotion Office's actions were close to destroying national products, requesting its cancellation. The Chaozhou native association in Shanghai also telegraphed Guangdong, stating that the measures for verifying and permitting the transportation and sale of native sugar were intended to prevent the smuggling and adulteration of foreign sugar. However, native sugar is cheap and foreign sugar is expensive, and even the most foolish person would not do this. Moreover, the export of native sugar must be inspected by the Chaozhou Customs, and re-inspected upon arrival at other ports. The procedures are already thorough. Now, suddenly adding attestation procedures during transportation only creates disturbance, without any practical benefit. The native sugar of Chaozhou is purely produced by farmers in rural villages, sparsely manufactured. They toil all year round, working hard, and a family of several depends on this for a living. If the verification procedures are cumbersome, transportation will inevitably be obstructed, turnover will be hampered, and life will become more difficult. At a time when rural villages are bankrupt, this is the only thing they can rely on for survival. Such harsh suppression will immediately lead to cessation of farming and stagnation of commerce. Called protection, it is no different from destruction, forcing us to appeal to your Excellency to order the cancellation of the temporary measures for inspecting native sugar at the factory, etc. According to reports from the Chaoan Nursery and Forestry Commissioner, the Department of Construction had previously ordered investigations in various counties regarding native sugar in the Chaozhou region. Sugarcane planting begins in February in spring and can be harvested by December. For each farming household, the cost of sugarcane seedlings, fertilizer, labor, field rent, land tax, field donations, and expenses for district and township offices, security fees, autonomy fees, harvesting labor, transportation labor, and sugarcane juice extraction fees for sugar mills amounts to 28 silver dollars per acre from planting to sugar boiling. Farmers usually have to borrow from wealthy farmers and sugar merchants to purchase fertilizer and pay public expenses, which are repaid after the sugar is sold or offset with sugar as interest. Farmers organize ancient sugar mills near the farmland, dismantling them immediately after the juice extraction and sugar boiling are completed. The sugar is stored in the farmers' homes. Sugar merchants from Chaozhou and Shantou then send people to the countryside to inspect and purchase the goods. After collection, they are transported to foreign firms in Shantou for packaging and then transshipped to various provinces in the Yangtze River inland for sale. The above is a report from government personnel, showing the hardship of farmers producing sugar.</p>
<p>Currently, the provincial government's measures to suppress native sugar are considered unfeasible in both production and sales, with three points of difficulty: (1) Regardless of the amount of native sugar, when transporting from the inland, a permit must be obtained from the national product public warehouse to accompany the goods, and inspectors must verify the permit along the way to allow passage. (2) When native sugar arrives in Shantou, if it is to be exported, a sample must be wrapped in paper, sealed in a glass bottle, numbered, and submitted to the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry for chemical verification to see if any foreign sugar impurities have been mixed in. (3) The export of native sugar must have the transportation permit, and the verification permit from the public warehouse before customs can be declared and shipping arranged, with very strict penalties set. After these suppression measures were implemented, farmers all complained bitterly. Moreover, inspectors harass everywhere. The government is clearly aware of this but tacitly approves of it. The National Products Promotion Office's reply to the Chaoan County government's letter serves as the government's defense. The letter states, "The sugar industry control was originally established to revitalize native sugar, plug loopholes, and attempt to save the bankrupt rural economy. Therefore, the control is limited to machine-made white sugar (which does not exist in the Chaozhou region). The privately-operated native yellow sugar can be freely bought and sold in the manufacturing areas, and there is no interference. However, the promotion of sugar from other districts is only subject to procedural inspection to prevent adulteration. There is currently no explicit text on control. However, after investigation, some distributors in nearby districts, in the name of control, create numerous difficulties for the transportation and sale of native sugar, extorting money on pretexts. They collect certificate fees from native sugar retail stores in violation of regulations (i.e., a certain amount of money must be paid for each inspection certificate), causing private sugar merchants and sellers of native sugar to have doubts about manufacturing and sales. Such a situation is no different from assisting the smuggling of foreign sugar and destroying the vitality of native sugar, which is contrary to the government's original intention of developing the provincial sugar industry, and is extremely hateful. Strict prohibition should be enforced to eliminate malpractices." The National Products Promotion Office's words are indeed like this, but there is no evidence that it has actually implemented them.</p>
<p>After investigation, the counties in the Chaozhou region are originally the richest areas for native sugar production. In addition to transporting and selling to various counties in the province, the amount transported annually by sea to various provinces in the Yangtze River for sale is about 2 million dan (each dan is 100 catties). However, it has decreased year by year due to the impact of Javanese white sugar. Since the imposition of taxes on foreign sugar, sugarcane growers in the rural villages of Chaozhou have revived. Each acre of sugarcane garden can produce 4 dan in a good year, and 2-3 dan in a dry year. The market price is 12-13 yuan per dan, and the retail price is 1.5 jiao per catty. However, the strong sales of native sugar pose a major threat to the National Products Promotion Office's "Five Rams" brand national sugar. Therefore, it is resented by the national sugar. As for the national sugar promotion methods, the Second National Sugar Public Warehouse is established in Shantou. Each county purchases from the National Products Promotion Office, ranging from 500 to 2300 packages per month. They must sell the full quota, and more sales get more rebates. Each package weighs 100 catties, with 24th-grade white sugar. The Hong Kong market price is 4.8 yuan per 100 catties. The National Products Promotion Office sells to merchants in Chaozhou and Shantou for 21 yuan in silver dollars, plus 4 jiao for transportation and 5 jiao for inspection. The merchants then hire many inspectors themselves to suppress native sugar. Moreover, the Chaoan distributor sells wholesale for 21.5 yuan per 100 catties in silver dollars. The Chenghai distributor sells the goods exclusively to three merchants in the city, allowing these three merchants to monopolize and raise prices arbitrarily. At the same time, they use the power of inspectors to suppress other native sugar merchants. The above are all public facts, which the National Products Promotion Office has already lamented in its letter. The people can do nothing about it.</p>
<p>The Department of Construction plans to establish a sugar factory in Qu Xi, Jieyang, to purchase sugarcane from the people to make sugar. In the future, there will be a lack of raw materials for native sugar, and farmers will not be able to survive. The situation will inevitably lead to this. Now, new native sugar is about to be on the market. Previously, the Chaoan national sugar distributor could sell 100 packages of national sugar per day. Now, due to the impact of native sugar, it sells less than 60 packages per day on average. Therefore, native sugar is greatly suppressed to support the promotion of national sugar. In fact, the so-called national sugar is a disguised form of foreign sugar, specially operated by the government's National Products Promotion Office, and thus euphemistically called national sugar. Generally, national sugar represents the government's interests, and native sugar represents the interests of rural villages, creating a contradiction. Judging from the current situation of native sugar being suppressed, the demise of native sugar is not far off. It is also regrettable.</p>

<p>Zhang Xiaohe</p>
<p>Record of the Trial of Suspected Wife Murder</p>
<p>The county court held a criminal hearing this morning (22nd) to try the case of suspected adultery between a brother-in-law and sister-in-law and the murder of the wife east of Huayang Bridge, which caused a sensation throughout the city, and the gallery was full. Zhang Xiaohe, the son of Zhang Xiaoyu, a villager, married Ye Delin's niece on the eighth day of the fourth month through the matchmaker Lu Xianghe. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the thirteenth day of the seventh month, Mrs. Zhang Ye was found dead with more than ten knife wounds. At that time, it was said to be suicide. Later, after the corpse's mother, Ye Lu, and uncle, Ye Delin, investigated based on the statements of fishermen Chen Tutudi and others, they believed that there was a suspicion of adultery between the brother-in-law and sister-in-law and murder. Moreover, when the deceased returned to Ning, she had mentioned the matter of the middle to her mother, which made it even more suspicious. They immediately hired lawyer Wu Chengqi and sued the prosecutor, summoning the defendants Zhang Xiaoyu and sister-in-law Xiao Zhang Shen for interrogation, and based on the testimony of witnesses Chen Tutudi and Xiao Alang, filed a lawsuit with the criminal court. Today, criminal court judge Zhang Yihuang, accompanied by the clerk, ascended the bench, summoned the original defendants and witnesses for interrogation. The defendant hired lawyer Lu Longxiang to defend him. First, the plaintiff Ye Lu and Ye Delin testified about the situation of the accusation, and then the witness Chen Tutudi testified that he was a fisherman. On this day, at dawn, he passed by the Zhang family's door and heard a cry for help, "Mama!" Then he learned of the death of Mrs. Zhang Ye, and the situation of more than ten knife wounds and a severed wrist. The witness Xiao Alang also testified that he had heard arguing the previous day, saying, "What is the reason for uncle sleeping in sister-in-law's room?" The voice was subtle, and then he heard a reply, saying, "Don't you be fierce." Ye Lu also testified that her daughter had told her when she returned to Ning that her brother-in-law and sister-in-law slept in the same room. Yu had sincerely asked her to be patient, and her daughter had left with tears in her eyes. However, when questioned, the defendant vehemently denied the charges. It was already four o'clock in the afternoon, so it was announced that the hearing would be continued on a scheduled date, and the debate was not opened before adjourning. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>The County Organizes a Work Relief Dredging Association</p>
<p>Due to the unusually severe drought this summer, all counties have been affected. Now, the County Construction Association, in order to provide relief to the disaster victims in various counties, held a meeting on the 20th of this month and decided to organize a Work Relief Dredging Association, using work as a form of relief, which is convenient for both public and private interests. The measurement will begin immediately. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) For the rivers to be dredged this year, except for the city moat, which will be requisitioned for labor, the dredging of rivers in various villages will be of a work relief nature. (2) Organize a Work Relief Dredging Association to take full responsibility and prepare an outline to be submitted to the department for record. (3) The downstream of the Second Main River, the upstream of the Fourth Main River, and the Lake Cao Pond, Xi Pu and other rivers, have been requested by citizens to be dredged. However, since six places, including Huangsipu, have already been opened for dredging, and funds are insufficient, the scheduled Xuliujing, Meitang, Limutang, Huangsipu, etc., should be measured first. If funds are remaining, a comprehensive plan will be made. (4) There are many places along the river embankment that have collapsed. A letter will be sent to the county to investigate and repair them.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Weather is Unusually Warm with Little Rain or Snow</p>
<p>In recent months, the weather in the county has been unusually warm with little rain or snow. The Fahrenheit thermometer is often in the range of 55-56 degrees, so seasonal diseases are prevalent, especially diphtheria, which is the most dangerous. After this prolonged drought, the river water is becoming shallower day by day. The river water in the city has a foul smell and cannot be used for drinking, which poses a serious problem for drinking water and fire fighting. The Relief Association Donates Funds to Relieve the Disaster</p>
<p>The county's Relief Association held its first standing committee meeting at the county government yesterday, chaired by County Chief Yan. The matters decided were: 1. The association's donations will be designated for storage in the Farmers' and Chinese Banks. 2. Qin Zhenhua of the relief home was appointed as accountant, Li Baisen of the Chamber of Commerce was appointed as general affairs officer, and Zhou Shaoji of the county government was appointed as document officer, responsible for handling association affairs. 3. The donation register will be numbered and lightly managed by Li Baisen. 4. The donation register will be distributed to the fundraising groups for fundraising. 5. The remaining funds from the county's flood relief association will be transferred to the association by the county government through a letter to the county property management office, specifically for relief purposes. The county government will also be requested to allocate the funds for repairing embankments in various districts to the association for relief purposes.</p>
<h3>Yinjiang</h3>
<p>Huangtiangang Will Begin Dredging This Year</p>
<p>The dredging of Huangtiangang outside the North Gate had been previously ordered by the Department of Construction to be remeasured and redrawn by the county for submission to the department. The head of the third division, Cui Hualiang, was sent to the province to personally explain to Director Shen and discuss dredging methods. It was decided to start construction before the end of the year. The estimated cost is 70,000 yuan, which will be covered by funds raised locally. If it is not enough, the province will subsidize it. The second phase of the project will be carried out this year to do the earthwork, and the ship lock will be built next spring.</p>

<p>The Yun Village Police Station Seizes a Large Quantity of Poison Pills</p>
<p>Huang Yuncheng, a patrol officer of the 7th Sub-Station directly under the Wu Yi Yun Village Public Security Bureau, dispatched patrol captain Li Weizhang to lead patrol officers to patrol the town at about 7 pm on the 20th. While patrolling on the west side of the motor road, they saw a small boat in the Jiangshanbang River traveling rapidly from east to west. Suspecting that it was suspicious, they ordered it to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the boat ignored the order and rowed quickly, still attempting to escape. They immediately led the police to chase after it. They saw a person on the boat suddenly jump into the water to escape, and another person threw a large package into the river. The patrolman Li Yucheng jumped into the river to swim and chase after the person, and quickly captured him. He was taken ashore and interrogated, and he gave his name as Xu Yaoshu. The person on the boat was his father, named Shunrong. One hundred iles of poison pills were found on his body. At this time, the small boat and the boatman Xu Shunfa were also captured, and a large package of poison pills was retrieved from the river, containing 30 packages, totaling about 30,000 pills, all soaked in water. They were immediately taken to the station together. After a preliminary interrogation, on the 21st, a document was prepared and police were dispatched to escort them to the city public security bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Most of the Provincial Warehouse is Completed</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Department of Finance, in view of the current situation of rural bankruptcy and disaster, believes that the construction of grain storage warehouses is an important task. Previously, the provincial government had decided to build large-scale provincial warehouses in ten grain-producing counties, including Wu County (the main stored items are rice and wheat, supplemented by silk cocoons and straw mats), Taixian (mainly rice, beans, and wheat), Yancheng (rice, beans, and cotton), Xuzhou (wheat, beans, hemp, and peanuts), Yixing (rice, wheat, and cocoons), Wujiang (rice, cocoons, and leaves), Rugao (wheat, cotton, and peanuts), and Changshu (mainly rice). The construction of the remaining two counties, Suqian and Huaiyin, was later and due to the gradually colder weather, the progress of the project was somewhat hindered. Therefore, the Department of Finance decided to start construction again next spring when the weather is warmer.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Line is Scheduled for Connection</p>
<p>The county's long-distance telephone was originally privately operated. This spring, the Ministry of Communications ordered the county's telegraph bureau to take over the management and connect calls with various counties north of the Yangtze River. Now, stores in the county and city feel that it is very inconvenient that Haimen is only separated from Shanghai by a river and cannot be connected. Moreover, Nantong was connected to Shanghai in August of this year, and the transmission of news is quite efficient. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the county chamber of commerce, which forwarded a letter to the bureau requesting that it find a way to connect the line. The bureau chief, Huang Binglin, prepared a plan and submitted it to the Land Administration Bureau for review. Yesterday, the bureau sent a telegram approving the matter and setting a deadline to start connecting the line in January next year.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>The Farmers' Bank Recovers Overdue Payments</p>
<p>The Jiaxing County Farmers' Bank is currently pursuing overdue payments from various cooperatives. It had previously proposed a method of reducing interest rates and setting a deadline for repayment. Then, it sent personnel to the various indebted cooperatives and guarantors to agree on a repayment period. Now that the deadline for recovery has expired, a small number of cooperatives, disregarding their credit, have still not repaid, and some are procrastinating. The bank believes that if it does not pursue the payments strictly, it will have a significant impact on future development. Therefore, it has specially prepared a list of the amount of debt owed by each cooperative along with the names of the guarantors, preparing to file a lawsuit according to law. It has also submitted a request to the Departments of Finance and Construction to order the county to pursue the payments.</p>
<h3>Tianjin</h3>
<p>The Zhanghua Branch Officially Opens</p>
<p>The Shanghai Zhanghua Woolen Textile Company previously sent factory manager Wu Bokang to Tianjin to prepare for the establishment of the Tianjin branch and test the machines for production. Everything is now ready, and the official opening is scheduled for December 6th. Invitations were sent to all sectors of society to visit. The newly appointed mayor, Zhang Ting'e, and people from all walks of life went to visit and were very satisfied with the excellent management.</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Met with Sun Ke Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reporting on the Hong Kong Trip and Exchanging Opinions</p>
<p>Sun Discussed that Mr. Hu Can Come North After the Spring Warms Up</p>
<p>Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning, accompanied by Legislative Yuan member Fu Bingchang and others. Central Committee member Dr. Wang Chonghui went to Sun's residence at about 9:00 am yesterday morning to meet with him. Mr. Wang departed for Zhejiang at 5:00 pm yesterday, accompanied by Chen Shaokuan, Zhou Xiangxian, and others. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sun and Wang Meeting: President Sun came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning because the Legislative Yuan announced a two-week recess. Mr. Wang Chonghui, who had just returned to Shanghai from the south, drove to Sun's residence from the World Academy at about 9:00 am to meet with him. The two talked for an hour. Mr. Wang reported in detail on his two meetings with Mr. Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong and left at 10:00 am. Mr. Sun decided to stay in Shanghai for a rest because the Legislative Yuan was in recess for two weeks. During this period, he will handle matters related to the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Hall.</p>
<p>Sun's Talk: After Mr. Wang left, President Sun received reporters at his residence. According to his talk, Mr. Wang Liangchou came to visit to report on his two meetings with Mr. Hu in Hong Kong. Before the Fifth Plenary Session, I went south to visit Mr. Hu with Mr. Wang. At that time, because the meeting was about to be held, I could not stay long and returned north first, leaving Mr. Wang in Hong Kong to continue talks with Mr. Hu and others. According to Mr. Wang, the result of the continued talks was even better. It is no longer a problem for Mr. Hu Zhantang to leave Hong Kong and come north. Mr. Hu originally planned to come to Shanghai immediately, but because the climate in Shanghai is colder than in Hong Kong, and Mr. Hu is weak, he plans to depart when the spring warms up. When Mr. Hu comes, it is feared that Mr. Chen Jitang and others will not be able to come north with him, because Mr. Chen has important local responsibilities and cannot leave his post for a long time. As for the national solidarity, the future is even more optimistic. During this period of national crisis, only national unity can save the nation and survive. All comrades in the southwest have expressed their sincerity and will work with the central government. As for the three points mentioned by Wang Liangchou in today's newspaper, they are all things that the central government should do. The so-called cooperation method is a plan on how to actively proceed in the future, and is not a condition. The southwest and the central government have long been cooperating. The Guangdong Provincial Finance Director Qu Fangpu went to Nanjing to visit President Wang to discuss the suppression of remaining bandits in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Wang's Talk: Wang Chonghui told reporters yesterday morning that he had met with President Wang, Minister Kong, President Sun, and others to report on his trip to Hong Kong and exchange opinions. The results were very good, and the prospects for cooperation are very optimistic. As for President Sun's intention, he believes that the southwestern propositions are all principles, and further actions should be taken in the future.</p>
<p>Departing for Zhejiang Yesterday: At 2:30 pm yesterday, Guangdong Finance Director Qu Fangpu specially went to the World Academy to visit Mr. Wang, and left after talking until about 3:00 pm. Mr. Wang, accompanied by Wei Daoming, departed for Zhejiang at 5:00 pm yesterday. Those traveling with him included Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan, Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian, and Song Zi'an. It is said that Mr. Wang will return to Shanghai in two or three days and go to The Hague to return to his post at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Department Prepares to Celebrate New Year's Day</h3>

The preparation situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Celebration Assembly: The Municipal Party Department has decided to issue a notice convening representatives from all walks of life to hold a celebration assembly at 10:00 am on New Year's Day at the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge. The personnel for the venue have been reserved, and all organizations in the city have been notified to host a group worship that morning and choose a time to have a banquet to celebrate.</p>
<p>Cinema Opening: In order to provide citizens with proper entertainment during the new year, the Municipal Party Department has sent personnel to contact the authorities of cinemas throughout the city and decided to add an extra screening on New Year's Day morning, without selling tickets. The admission tickets will be distributed by the Municipal Party Department. It is heard that the cinemas are very supportive, so no tickets will be sold on that day, and the admission tickets will be issued by the Municipal Party Department.</p>
<p>Printing Spring Couplets: In order to meet the needs of citizens, the Municipal Party Department has specially printed a large number of spring couplets and distributed them to various agencies, organizations, and households for application.</p>

<p>Wealthy Residents Donations: The Emergency Relief General Donation Association, after days of careful discussions with leaders from various sectors, has decided to solicit donations from wealthy residents based on their financial capacity. Details were published in yesterday's newspaper. It is reported that the letters to the wealthy residents have already been sent out by the Emergency Relief General Donation Association. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. If the wealthy residents can generously donate, the amount will be considerable, which will greatly benefit the disaster victims.</p>
<p>Household Donations: The household general donation campaign has been progressing well in recent days. It is reported that the Emergency Relief General Donation Association is continuing the campaign with the goal of reaching all households in the city and ensuring universal donations. Yesterday, personnel were still dispatched to solicit donations from door to door and publicize the plight of the disaster areas. However, Shanghai is vast and diverse, with people from all walks of life. To ensure the integrity of the process and make it easier for citizens to identify legitimate solicitors, the association has created staff identification cards with the association's seal and affixed with the solicitor's half-body photo.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Fourth New Ship, Hai Zhen, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Supervising Engineer, Mr. Shi Gan, Arrived on the Ship</p>
<p>Hai Li Was Officially Received Yesterday, and Invitations for Scheduled Visits Were Sent Out</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's fourth new ship, Hai Zhen, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The Hai Li was officially received by the company. Visits for people from all walks of life are scheduled for Monday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hai Zhen Arrives in Shanghai: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's fourth new ship, Hai Zhen, sailed to Shanghai after its completion in England. At 2 PM on the 21st, the ship arrived at the Tongsha waters outside Wusong. The Shanghai Moller &amp; Company obtained permission from China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send a pilot to the mouth of Song to guide the ship to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to enter the port at 4 PM that afternoon, but due to fog on the sea, it anchored in Wusong at that time. It was not until the fog cleared yesterday morning that it was guided into the port and sent to the Jiangnan Shipyard, where it will be painted and the hull inspected before official acceptance.</p>
<p>Appointment of Captain: Mr. Shi Gan, the supervising engineer sent by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to England to oversee the construction of the four ships, has returned to Shanghai with the Hai Zhen, as all four ships have been completed. He arrived at the company yesterday and reported everything to Mr. Liu Hongsheng. The company has decided to appoint Mr. Dax, former captain of the Pu An ship, as the captain of the Hai Zhen. The first and second mates, as well as the chief engineer, have also been internally determined and will be announced next Monday. The ship is scheduled to begin receiving all deck departments from the 25th.</p>
<p>Reception of Hai Li: The third new ship, Hai Li, has completed its inspection at the Jiangnan Shipyard. Captain Xi Shibia and First Mate Chen Bangda were appointed to the ship yesterday. Yesterday, the company assigned Zhao Yuntai, director of the Shipping Department, and Shen Jiyun, chief captain, to the ship for official acceptance. Hai Li was handed over by Moller &amp; Company, representing the shipyard, and the company flag and national flag were immediately hoisted. It is now scheduled to sail to the Jinliyuan Wharf today. Yesterday afternoon, the company telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, stating that the Hai Li was officially received today (the 22nd) and reporting the matter.</p>
<p>Additional Invitation to Visit: Labor union, the Captains' Association, and other leaders of party and government institutions, such as Yang Hu, did not participate in the previous invitation to visit the Hai Yuan. Therefore, the company specially issued an additional 50 invitations and prepared refreshments and meals for 50 guests on the Hai Li, inviting leaders from the Party and government institutions to visit the ship at the Jinliyuan Wharf on Monday morning. Liu Hongsheng will personally board the ship to receive the guests. The ship will be scheduled to sail to Nanhua. Because the Hai Li has a Chinese captain, it will also give up Hong Kong passengers.</p>

<h3>Private Postal Services in Panic as Deadline Approaches</h3>
<p>Held Reception Last Night to Issue Declaration</p>
<p>But Post Office Claims There Will Be No Impediment to Their Livelihoods</p>
<p>Hua Yunjin, the general representative of private postal services nationwide, Yin Yuantong, and others held a banquet last night to entertain public organizations and the press in this city to report on the Ministry of Communications' order to cease operations. At the same time, they issued a declaration. However, the post office claimed that if the private postal services cease operations but do not violate postal regulations, there is still a way to maintain their livelihoods. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reception for Various Sectors: At 6 PM yesterday, the industry specially held a reception at the Tai He Yuan Restaurant on Second Ma Road to entertain public organizations and the press in this city. Attendees included Yu Zuoting, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Yu Qiaqing, a leader in the business community; representatives from the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Ningbo Association, Farmers' Association, Education Association, and other organizations; and more than 50 reporters from various newspapers. Hua Yunjin and Yin Yuantong, two representatives, made announcements. The banquet lasted until after 9 PM and ended in a cheerful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Declaration Issued: The industry issued a declaration stating, "Our private postal service industry originated during the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty. It has always been known for its prompt service and reliable integrity, and has therefore been deeply appreciated by all sectors. When the postal service was first established on a trial basis at the end of the Guangxu period, it was only limited to major cities and towns. At that time, although people submitted their letters to the post office for delivery, silver, clothing, and other items were still sent through the private postal services. This is a history of hundreds of years. Not only is it convenient and reassuring, but the prosperity of commerce and the stability of society are particularly evident in the past achievements. After the Republic of China, the postal service was established as a state-owned enterprise, and the authorities actively made reforms. However, letters and other items only reached important towns, and remittances and packages only reached cities, and the cumbersome procedures made rural people flinch. Therefore, before the national postal service can be fully established nationwide, private postal services still have value in existence. Now, the postal authorities, seeking to take credit, only know how to unify postal rights and do not understand the needs of society. They hastily submitted a proposal for suppression. The Ministry of Communications has issued a notice limiting the nationwide private postal services to cease operations by the end of Year 23. But once implemented, it will cause great suffering to our compatriots in remote rural areas who live abroad. For example, those who do business in cities and commercial ports, whose monthly income is not abundant and who rely on it to support their families, but whose homes are in rural areas far from the city, have always relied on the private postal services to deliver money to them on a monthly basis. If they switch to the postal service, they must go to the general office to send and receive, and they must find a reliable guarantor, which is cumbersome. The ignorant villagers will be helpless, and the expensive postage will increase the burden, which is not the blessing of the common people. The unemployment of all our industry employees is another matter. In view of this, our industry has tried its best to argue and petition various central agencies to allow for a delay in the closure, and at the same time, to seek a satisfactory solution for the aftermath. The resulting images are still satisfactory, but it also depends on the support of our colleagues to achieve success. We have always admired the leaders of your association for their insight into public opinion and their deep understanding of social needs. We dare to ask for unanimous support to request the central competent department to consider social needs and take into account the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of employees in the private postal service industry, and to allow a suspension of the implementation and a delay in the closure before a satisfactory solution for the aftermath is found. Society will be fortunate, and our industry will be fortunate."</p>
<p>Post Office's Statement: After the Ministry of Communications issued an order limiting all private postal services to cease operations by the end of this year, the Shanghai Private Postal Service Association convened a meeting of representatives from private postal services in various provinces, and went to the Party and government agencies in this city to petition for the transfer of the request to the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order. On the 14th of this month, representatives Yin Yuantong, etc., were appointed to go to Beijing and jointly petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications with representatives from various provinces to request the maintenance of the status quo. After returning to Shanghai, they convened a meeting at the Southern City Private Postal Service Association to report on the petition process. Because the deadline is approaching, a reporter from the New Voice News went to the Shanghai office of the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road to inquire. The person in charge of the office said, "In Year 17 of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Communications held a communications conference and resolved that all private postal services should be abolished by Year 19. Later, because the industry merchants repeatedly requested, the Ministry of Communications, out of consideration, specially approved a flexible solution and separately formulated five provisional measures for private postal services to register and obtain licenses, so that each private postal service could register, obtain a license, and continue to operate in accordance with the regulations, giving the industry merchants an opportunity to gradually close and change industries. Later, in response to the request of the industry in various places, the Ministry of Communications again extended the registration period by one year. This is enough to show the authorities' repeated tolerance and consideration for the industry, and their concern for both sides. Moreover, after the General Post Office received the ministry's order limiting all private postal services to cease operations by the end of this year, at the beginning of the year, it ordered each district post office administration to notify each private postal service to prepare to gradually cease operations. According to the reports submitted by each of these administrations, many private postal services in various places are preparing to cease operations, and 23 have already voluntarily ceased operations. Yesterday, another report was received from the Shanghai Administration, stating that the district has already ceased operations, with a total of seven companies including the previous ones. Private postal services that have not registered are violating postal regulations and have long been subject to suppression. As for the private postal services, they can still make use of their original credibility, change their names, and deliver items and money to the people. This does not conflict with postal regulations and can solve the livelihood problems of the industry merchants."</p>

<p>Eulogy for the Ceremony: On December 23rd, the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Municipal Government and other eighty-two public organizations offer this eulogy to the spirit of Mr. Shi Liangcai: Oh, admirable is our Mr. Shi, highly respected in his hometown, a brilliant talent known to the world, blessed by heaven. From his youth, he embraced learning, his reputation soaring through the schools. His character and judgment surpassed others. Elders of the time eagerly sought his guidance, anticipating his great potential, and showing him their appreciation. He governed with innovation, nurturing talent. Like a gentle spring breeze, he opened minds and expanded horizons. He was diligent in public service, studying diligently to understand things, exploring principles and seeking origins. With his outstanding talent and insightful vision, he systematized and regulated. Initially, he tried his hand as a traveling merchant, using strategies that ensured success. Utilizing his spare time, he articulated policies on salt and iron, toiling through waves and boiling the sea, benefiting the people's livelihoods. During the recovery of China, every accomplishment, great or small, was achieved through his efforts, his dedication. Wherever the banners and flags reached, no obstacle remained unconquered. After the success, he stepped down, retiring from public office. He embraced hardship and shouldered great responsibilities, responding to changes. With foresight and broad vision, he advocated for goodness. He guided those who were lost. Truly, he was a beacon, becoming prosperous through his efforts. His contributions to the party and the nation were far-reaching, his fame spreading throughout the world. His influence extended everywhere, turning heaven and earth. His grand house was vast, its roof majestic. He cultivated with his heart and blood, focusing on nurturing life. He gathered to distribute, feeling the thirst and hunger of others as his own. He opened granaries and distributed grain, widely practicing benevolence. Nurturing talent was his priority, followed by collecting books. He watered and planted, diligently promoting the people's wisdom. His recommendations were numerous, his reputation growing daily. He remained serene and unchanged, with a clear mind in his simplicity. Occasionally, he offered suggestions, analyzing the subtle and nuanced, resolving conflicts decisively. In crowded gatherings, one word from him would settle matters. In large assemblies, people would hold their breath. Amidst the grand scenery of the mountains, he was a true spirit. The yin符 and the I Ching, he knew the signs of things to come. During the Northeast Incident, when the border troubles suddenly arose, he widened his eyes in anger, striving to suppress the rebellion. The golden goblet was broken, the vast deserts were vast, the jade璧 had shattered, and the brave warriors had no home. He came to comfort and console them, boosting morale. He provided support and assistance, delivering grain. He retained a bit of righteousness, to correct the declining customs. His passionate heart, like Lingwei's crane returning, was still there. He planned for commerce, holding a cup in the apricot grove, navigating the seas. He sat surrounded by a city of books, rivaling the Langhuan Library. He circulated currency, gathering it from the nine treasuries. All these initiatives were met with widespread approval, with countless people looking to him as a role model. But in this unfortunate year, like owls destroying a nest, he faced disaster. He was buried with his cart. He carried his resentment on his back. Dark clouds filled the sky, and the wind suddenly rose. The river's waves soared, and the wild fragrance withered on the ground. At this time, he transformed and ascended to heaven, riding high in a cloud chariot, assisted by a pair of dragons. May he not close his eyes, and look down upon this world of filth. Across the vast seas, everyone weeps for him. With orchid nectar and cassia wine, we express our grief and sorrow. Our feelings reach the gates of heaven. May his soul return! Alas, alas, alas! Accept this offering.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhaoying Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discusses the Growing Development of Party Affairs in Fujian Province</p>
<p>Salt Administration Reform Commission May Be Established Next Spring</p>
<p>Chen Zhaoying, Central Committee member and Special Commissioner of Party Affairs for Fujian Province, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:25 AM, taking an overnight train from Beijing. After getting off the train, he went to his hotel to rest. He is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for two or three days before returning to his hometown of Pujiang County in Zhejiang Province to organize winter relief efforts. A Xin Xin News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Chen at his residence yesterday, and the details of the conversation are as follows:</p>
<p>Party Affairs in Fujian Province: According to Mr. Chen, he was sent to Fujian Province to reorganize the province's party affairs and has been working for several months. The work carried out in these months has focused on training party members on the party's intentions and concentrating their thoughts. At the same time, public schools have been established in various counties throughout the province to train the public, ensuring they have pure intentions. The development of party affairs in Fujian Province is improving daily, and preparations for recruiting party members will soon begin. In the future, efforts will be made to ensure that the public in every county, village, and town can adhere to the spirit of the party, so that talents from all regions can be gathered.</p>
<p>Suppression of Banditry: The banditry in Fujian Province was originally rampant, but after the army's thorough suppression efforts, it has gradually been eradicated. Currently, in the border counties, there are still some scattered remnants of bandits hiding, but with their old nests destroyed and losing their support, they are powerless. It is expected that all the bandits will be eliminated soon. The political situation in Fujian Province has become stable, and various construction projects are making significant progress. In terms of finance, after the financial authorities made efforts to reorganize, revenue and expenditure are roughly balanced. This year, several new banks have been established in Fujian Province, which have greatly benefited the province's finances by circulating throughout the province.</p>
<p>Implementation of Salt Law: The Xin Xin News Agency reporter then inquired about the process of proposing the implementation of the salt law at the Fifth Plenary Session. According to Mr. Chen, the new salt law was promulgated three years ago, but due to various obstacles, it has not been implemented. Therefore, it was brought up for discussion at the Fifth Plenary Session and approved by the assembly. The Executive Yuan will organize a Political Reform Commission to prepare for the implementation of the salt law. The commission will be established no later than January 20th of next year. Salt is a necessary commodity for the people, and it has a significant impact on their livelihoods. Currently, the price of salt is high, which greatly affects people's food. Therefore, the mission of the Salt Administration Reform Commission is to (1) reorganize salt affairs and increase salt production, and (2) after taxing salt fields, it can be circulated throughout the country. Thus, the accumulated abuses of salt affairs over the years can be eliminated, and the salt law can be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>First Anniversary of Mr. Wu Tiyun's Death</h3>
<p>The Wu Tiyun Memorial Society issued a notice yesterday stating, "Respectfully announce that January 2nd, 24th year [of the Republic], is the first anniversary of Mr. Wu Tiyun's death. A public memorial service will be held at the Zhongshan Cultural Education Center at 803 Foch Road, Shanghai, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM that afternoon. We respectfully invite Mr. Wu's friends, relatives, and people from all walks of life who admire his life and conduct to attend the service. Respectfully announced by the Wu Tiyun Memorial Society."</p>
<h3>French Consul-General Warns Subordinates Against Accepting Gifts</h3>
<p>Mr. Meili'ai, the French Consul-General stationed in Shanghai, aware that in the past, during holidays such as Christmas and New Year's, citizens of this concession would prepare gifts and present them to French Consul-General and the Shanghai Municipal Council police and other public officials. This behavior, according to French law, there is an infringement, so Mr. Meili'ai cautiously warned subordinates that all public officials in this concession must not accept any gifts in order to maintain integrity. At the same time, citizens of this concession were notified not to send gifts.</p>
<h3>Local Coordination Council Rescue Team Continues Work in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>This summer, the Shanghai Local Coordination Council, recognizing the severity of the disaster and the prevalence of epidemics in the recovered bandit areas of Jiangxi Province, and the urgent need for rescue among the compatriots in the disaster areas, organized a rescue team led by Dr. Pang Jingzhou, a member of the council, in July. They led a team of doctors and nurses to Guangchang Station and other places in Jiangxi Province to work, providing medical treatment and medicine. For four months, they treated over 41,290 disaster victims, with excellent results. They received awards from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, as well as plaques and silver shields from various military units and public organizations, in large numbers. Last month, the council, due to the scheduled work period nearing completion, telegraphed the team to end their work and return to Shanghai. At that time, many places telegraphed to request they stay, but due to time constraints, they could not fulfill the requests to remain in Jiangxi. Recently, they received another telegram from Chairman Chiang and invitations from various local organizations in Jiangxi Province, and now, under the guidance of Dr. Pang, they will continue to work in Jiangxi Province. It is reported that preparations have been completed, and Dr. Pang Gongzhe, Yang Dingguo, and Han Baojiu, as well as nurses Wang Yongling and Zhang Zhijie, will take a large batch of medicines on the Xiyi ship on the 18th evening. On the 18th at noon, members Huang Yanpei, Jiang Wenyu, and others held a farewell banquet for the team members at the council's office to express their appreciation.</p>
<h3>Songpu Steamer Freed from Shoal Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Songpu steamer, belonging to the Sanbei Company, has been stranded near Wuhu for more than a week. Due to the falling river level, the Songpu steamer had a deeper draft and could not be rescued at the time. Later, the Fuyang steamer and iron barges arrived at the Songpu boat to unload its cargo. Finally, coal was burned in the barges. Until yesterday morning, during high tide, the Songpu could move. The shipowner then opened the engine full power and managed to get out of the shoal. It then went to Pangtzechi to moor. Yesterday afternoon, the company received a telegram from the Songpu shipowner stating that the Songpu's coal and cargo had been completely unloaded, leaving only 300 sacks. At 6:00 AM on the 22nd, the ship was able to escape danger on its own and is now anchored at the lower end of Bangziji. It is now loading coal and will transfer the Fuyang's cargo back onto the ship, and then head to Hankou.</p>

<h3>Lian'an Maoli Steamship Company Business Competition Dispute Escalates</h3>
<p>Navigation Administration Bureau Thoroughly Investigates Price War</p>
<p>Maoli Steamship Company Asks for Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the ships of the Lian'an Shipping Bureau in this city operate on the Shanghai-Taiwan route, sailing according to schedule every week, and the business is developing well. Recently, in order to compete with the Maoli Company, the company abandoned the original Wednesday schedule of the Chuanshan ship and changed it to Thursday, sailing on the same schedule as the Maoli ship of the Maoli Company, causing a major dispute between the two sides. The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications specially ordered a thorough investigation, and the Maoli Steamship Company requested assistance from all sectors to maintain the navigation industry and benefit navigation. The details learned by the Xin Xin News Agency reporter are as follows:</p>
<p>Navigation Administration Bureau Thoroughly Investigates: The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications issued an order to the Maoli Steamship Company yesterday, stating that according to the Lian'an Shipping Company's report, the company was formed four years ago by the Zhoushan Steamship Company, Ping'an Steamship Company, Chuanshan Steamship Company, Daxing Shipping Company, Yili Steamship Company, and Taizhou Xinjihang Shipping Company, which operate on the Shanghai-Taiwan route. In the past, due to business relations, the competition was fierce, and the losses were huge, almost unsustainable. Fortunately, the ministry sent personnel to guide them, and the Shanghai Shipping Association tried its best to mediate, and the company was established to operate jointly and cooperate thoroughly, reporting to the ministry for record, in order to prolong their survival. However, after four years of cooperation, the losses have increased daily, and the reason is that the industry does not understand, and small-tonnage ships often insert themselves to sail, engaging in price wars. For example, the Maoli, an inland port shallow-water ship sailing on the Shanghai-Shazhou route, inserted itself into the market, recklessly cutting freight and passenger prices, which has not stopped to this day. Recalling the difficulty of creating the bureau, it is endless to describe. However, in China's shipping industry, such thorough cooperation is still an innovation. Looking at the other lines, there is no follow-up. To set an example for shipping industry cooperation, every time I remember the kindness of the ministry and the association, I can't forget it. After the cooperation, due to the lack of guarantees, allowing other ships to insert themselves and mess things up, the losses will lead to bankruptcy, which was unexpected at the beginning. Therefore, some members feel that they are bound by cooperation and are exhausted. They believe that individual struggle is better than cooperation. However, at a time when the country is advocating cooperation, if the bureau collapses, it may have an impact and become an obstacle to future cooperation. They are worried and do not know what to do. They believe that shipping cooperation is the only way to save the dying shipping industry. The bureau is guiding and promoting future cooperation, and will certainly try to help the cooperation that has been established and is about to collapse. Therefore, they appeal to the bureau to investigate and verify, and order the Maoli ship not to engage in price competition during the design cooperation period, and strictly supervise it. The future of cooperation depends on this, and it is not just the bureau that can be preserved. According to this investigation, if there is a price war during the cooperation preparation period, it should be strictly prohibited. What is the actual situation? Please reply in detail for verification. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Maoli Calls for Assistance: After receiving the instructions from the Navigation Administration Bureau, the Maoli Steamship Company immediately reported the process to the bureau and requested assistance from all sectors of the city. The original text reads, (omitted above) The Maoli ship of our company has been sailing on the Shanghai-Taiwan line for more than a year, with accurate schedules and convenient for merchants and travelers. Unexpectedly, Lian'an Shipping Company, a competitor on the same route, wants to dominate the line and does not allow a third party to intervene. Relying on its large fleet and abundant resources (Zhoushan, Daxing, Chuanshan, Dahua, and Taizhou), it is determined to manipulate the market as it pleases. Therefore, based on its local practices, although it knows that it cannot order the Maoli to stop sailing or force merchants to stop loading, it actually sent the Chuanshan ship to abandon the original Wednesday schedule, secretly reducing the fares, and sailing on the same schedule as the Maoli on Thursday. It is clear that it is intentionally disrupting business, making it difficult for Maoli to retreat, and achieving its goal of monopolizing the market. It does not consider that shipping companies should maintain each other when they are bankrupt, and how can they engage in internal strife? According to the company, the design of cooperation does not allow for further destruction. They have assumed considerable responsibility. It is the winter prevention season. If they cannot bear it, the traffic and travelers will be greatly affected. (Omitted below)</p>

<h3>Recent News on the National Christian Girls' Association's Rural Labor Projects</h3>
<p>The National Association of the National Christian Girls' Association, located at No. 133, Shiyuan Road in this city, has been actively involved in rural labor projects in recent years, in addition to its efforts in urban work. It believes that rural revitalization is a crucial plan for saving the country today, and that the dissemination of education is particularly urgent for the laboring farmers. Therefore, in September of this year, it sent Ms. Huang Fuying, the director of the rural department, to Songshu and Dachang Towns in Chunhua Town, which are organized by the association, to provide practical guidance.

<h3>Hu Die's Contract Termination Case with China South Chemicals</h3>
<p>The third trial ends... Hu Die still loses the lawsuit</p>
<p>Hu Die's appeal in the contract termination case with China South Chemicals to the Supreme Court has ended with the third trial, and Hu Die still lost the lawsuit. The full text of the Supreme Court's judgment is recorded below. Supreme Court Civil Judgment No. 1092 of the 23rd year. Appellant Hu Die, litigation agents Feng Xizui and Qin Liankui, appellee China South Chemical Industry Cooperative, legal representative Xu Gongming, litigation agents Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun. The appellant appealed the second instance judgment of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court on April 17, 23rd year of the Republic of China, regarding the confirmation of the non-existence of the contract between the parties. This court's judgment is as follows: Main text: The appeal is dismissed. The costs of the third instance litigation shall be borne by the appellant. Reason: In this case, the appellant agreed with the appellee on June 4, 21st year of the Republic of China that the appellant's name and portrait would be used as trademarks for various cosmetics manufactured by the appellant. Article 9 of the contract states that the cosmetics using Party B's name and portrait as trademarks must be produced by Party A successively within the shortest period of time from the date of signing this contract. If there is no product after one year, this contract will be invalidated. According to the interpretation of the meaning of the text, the so-called "no product after one year" refers to no product within one year. It cannot be said that the appellee did not produce all kinds of cosmetics within one year, and the appellant can claim to terminate the contract. Moreover, Article 11 of the contract stipulates that the operation of several kinds of cosmetics that have been produced may be stopped midway, so it is even more obvious that the cosmetics cannot be regarded as the reason for terminating the contract if they have not been produced all together. The appellant said that the explanation of this article must be that all products must be produced before it can be considered proper. Secondly, although the appellee had disputes with the Family Industry Cooperative due to this trademark, and the business was hindered, it has already produced tooth powder with the appellant's portrait within the agreed period. The court hearing the facts has reviewed and confirmed that the batch of wholesale accounts and Bao Wen Printing Bureau delivery accounts are true, and it cannot be disputed by empty words. Also, Article 5 of the contract stipulates that Party A's business situation should be reported to Party B on a monthly basis. However, this regular report is only for the appellant to know the business situation and is only a procedure for the implementation of the contract, not the content of the contract. Therefore, regardless of whether the appellee fulfills the contract or not, there is no question of termination of the contract. Moreover, the appellant can go to check according to the contract, so it will not suffer any kind of damage, and there is no reason to claim termination of the contract. As for the appellant's claim in appealing to this court that there is a reason to revoke the expression of intent in Article 88 of the Civil Code, it is obviously contrary to the legal precedent that no new facts can be claimed in the third instance, and it is not acceptable, let alone discussed.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusion, the appeal in this case is unreasonable. According to Article 440, Article 415, and Article 81 of the Civil Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>

<p>Three Thieves Flee in Terror Without Stealing Anything</p>
<p>Gatekeeper Shot and Injured While Apprehending Thief</p>
<p>| Bodyguard Slightly Injured While Pursuing Other Thieves |</p>
<p>At 8:50 yesterday morning, four bandits suddenly appeared at No. 35 Xuyi Lane, Beijing Road and Henan Road, the Xiekang Qianzhuang, and attempted to rob the business while concealing three handguns. One bandit stood guard at the back door, while the other three bandits barged in. One bandit stood in the parlor, and the other two bandits drew their guns and broke into the accounting room, demanding silence. Just as they were about to begin robbing, the qianzhuang's bodyguard, a Tianjin native surnamed Wang, noticed the bandit standing in the parlor. Without making a sound, he drew his gun and opened fire on the bandit. The bandit was hit in a vital spot and immediately fell to the ground and died. The other two bandits in the accounting room heard the alarm and realized that things were not going well. Without robbing anything, they hurried out of the front door, where they encountered the gatekeeper of No. 32 Lane. Fearing an attack, they opened fire first, hitting the gatekeeper in the head and knocking him to the ground. The two bandits took advantage of this time to flee without a trace. However, after the bodyguard Wang shot and killed one bandit, he was deeply afraid that the two bandits in the inner room would escape from the back door, so he quietly went out of the back door to wait. Unexpectedly, the bandit guarding at the back door heard the gunshots and ran away first. Unexpectedly, the two bandits escaped from the front door, where they encountered the gatekeeper of No. 2 Lane at the entrance of the lane. They opened fire and wounded the gatekeeper. The bodyguard was also slightly injured. After the incident, the general patrol room received a report and immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to search for the escaped bandits, but they were nowhere to be found. They sent the bandit's body to the forensics office on Fielun Road for an autopsy and sent the wounded gatekeeper and others to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the gatekeeper's injuries are quite serious.</p>

The rickshaw puller exerted himself, but suddenly lost control and fell on a stone. The passenger also fell over. The passenger got up and was about to question the rickshaw puller, but saw that the rickshaw puller's face was broken, bleeding, and barely breathing. He was lying on the ground unable to get up. He hurriedly took out two coins and threw them at the rickshaw puller, and then hurried away. At the same time, passers-by saw the situation and all tried to save the man's life, not bothering to care about the passenger's escape.

<p>Deceiving Women with Weak Wills</p>
<p>Performing Indiscriminate Incisions, Causing Bleeding and Death</p>
<p>Ding A'ren from Haimen used to work at the mint and lived at No. 268 Zhongshan Road. On the 15th of this month, Ding went to work at the factory. Suddenly, an itinerant doctor Wang broke into Ding's house and pointed out that Ding's wife, Ms. Yu, was suffering from jaundice and needed immediate treatment. If she waited any longer, she would be incurable. He used all kinds of threatening words. Ms. Yu listened and believed him to be true, so she asked Wang to treat her. Wang immediately opened the small package he was carrying, took out a small knife, cut open Ding Yu's right palm, and applied medicinal powder. Unexpectedly, the wound from the incision bled profusely. Wang saw that he had caused trouble and still claimed that it was okay. He pretended to go to get hemostatic medicine and took the opportunity to escape. When Ding finished work in the evening and returned home to inquire, he knew that he had been deceived. He searched for Wang but could not find him. Ding was very frustrated. However, Ms. Yu's palm bled for days and could not be stopped. Due to excessive bleeding, she died at 2:00 pm the day before yesterday. Ding A'ren was filled with grief and indignation. He hired people to search everywhere for Wang, determined to catch Wang.

However, Wang also had a piece of silk fabric of a similar color to be dyed at the same time, but the material was slightly thinner. At about 9:00 am yesterday, the customer came to pick up the goods. Wang happened to be handling them, and a bad idea suddenly arose in his mind. He handed the customer his own piece of silk fabric. After careful inspection by the customer, he realized that it was not his own thing, and a quarrel broke out. The accountant of the shop came out to mediate, and finally the customer's raw materials were handed over, and the matter was settled. The matter was reported to the manager, who believed that Wang's actions had damaged the reputation of the shop. He immediately summoned the person who introduced him to come and planned to dismiss Wang. Wang, upon hearing the news, was ashamed to face others and suddenly had the idea of ​​dying. He jumped from the third floor, causing his brains to burst and died on the spot. Afterwards, the manager of the shop reported to the police station and used an ambulance to transport the body to Tongren Hospital, and then transferred it to the autopsy.</p>
<h3>Transportation University Messenger Instigates Accomplices to Commit Robbery</h3>
<p>Two More Thieves Caught in the Shanghai Bank Robbery in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>Stolen Money of Only Two Hundred Yuan Recovered, Rescheduled for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>On the 21st of last month, the Yu Garden Road branch of Shanghai Bank sent staff to transport 5,200 yuan in cash by car to the Savings Office of Jiaotong University at the end of Haig Road in western Shanghai. On the way in Haig Road, a gang of robbers stole all the money. The bank reported to various police agencies to investigate and arrest the stolen goods. Later, the Public Concession Police successively arrested the bandits Zhang Zhilong (30 years old, from Haimen, living at No. 10 Fukang Lane, Daxilu, working in a medicine factory), Huang Yaosheng (31 years old, local, living at No. 4 Zhangjiazhai, Daxilu, working as a car opener), Guan Zuozhou (35 years old, from Haimen, living at No. 11 Dongwangjia Lane, Daxilu, working as a tea and food clerk), Zhu Xueneng (24 years old, from Haimen, living at No. 25 Chenjia Lane, Hongqiao North, working as a messenger at Jiaotong University), Chen Goudi (31 years old, local, living in Changxing Pavilion, Dushenfu Road), Tan Jingen (also known as Gendi, 29 years old, local, living in a bungalow in Hujiazai, Lan Road, Gaolang Bridge, working in Xielong Silk Factory), A Mei (44 years old, local, living in a bungalow in Baziqiao, Zhabei, working in Dongxing Leather Factory), Huang Shuncai (26 years old, from Haimen, living at No. 10 Fukang Lane, Daxilu, working as a rice clerk) and other eight people. It was also found that Zhang Zhilong committed a robbery on October 27 with Gong Guorui's family property at No. 186 Xinzha Road and was escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation. In addition to sentencing Zhang to seven years in prison, the Shanghai Bank robbery should be under the jurisdiction of the Second Special District Court. The French Police requested the Second Special Court to prepare a document to send detective Yang Yilong to transfer Zhang and other eight thieves to the French Police, and then escorted them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The case was investigated by Jin Jiulin, the supervisor of the special agency of the French Police, detectives Zhou Buguang, Zhang Ziying, Qian Yumin, and deputy detective Cai Jinzhang. According to the confessions of the criminals, Gu A'jin (36 years old, from Shaoxing, living at No. 19 Xinle Lane, Mintiniyin Road, working as an inspector on a Wuchang steamship) and Xu A'tao (38 years old, local, living at No. 4 Kainan Road) were arrested, and more than 200 yuan of stolen banknotes were searched out. It was also found that the cause of the case was that Zhu Xueneng, the messenger of Jiaotong University, instigated Zhang Zhilong to collude with the party to commit the robbery. Zhang agreed with the party to wait at the robbery location, and he would signal by taking off his hat and waving it high, intending to commit the robbery. The time has been long. In the first robbery, because they saw foreign soldiers exercising near Haig Road, they saw the car carrying the money passing by, but did not dare to take action. The second time, because the car carrying the money was driving too fast, the bandits could not stop it and did not achieve their purpose. The third time, they learned that the bank would be escorting a large amount of money on November 21, so the bandits planned to order Huang Shuncai and two accomplices who were still at large to carry a load of rice straw each and wait on Haig Road. When the Shanghai Bank car carrying the money arrived, Huang and others would block it with rice straw in front, and the bandits would drive the car carrying the money away to achieve the purpose of dividing the huge amount of money they had robbed. It was also found that the bandits, at 6:30 pm on September 10 of this year, robbed Yao Mushun, the owner of the tiger stove at No. 1632 Xiafei Road, of 400 yuan in cash and gold jewelry, Shanghai Bank passbooks, totaling 537 yuan in stolen goods for distribution. This case was interrogated by Judge Qiu Huanrong in the first criminal court yesterday. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case and said that the police investigation in this case was not yet completed, and there were still accomplices at large who had not been captured, and only more than 200 yuan of stolen money had been recovered. He requested that the date be changed to two weeks later for detailed investigation of the case, to supplement the arrest of accomplices, and to search for the stolen money. He sued the court for interrogation. The court verified the tickets and briefly questioned the defendants, and then ordered the defendants to be taken back into custody and rescheduled for interrogation on the 28th of this month. The defendants were still taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>Septuagenarian's Only Son Tragically Dies</h3>
<p>Zhou Haitao Detained for Interrogation</p>
<p>Wang Yushan, who lives at No. 4 Rendeli, An'najin Road, French Concession, has a private car with license plate number 13078 (Concession Pass). He hires Jiang Mingqing from Tongzhou as a driver. Jiang has a fellow villager, Zhou Haitao, who is 37 years old this year and lives at No. 8, Lane 260, Bair Road, French Concession. Zhou runs a Chinese car school specializing in teaching car driving technology and serves as the principal. On the afternoon of the 20th of this month, Zhou drove Wang Yushan's car No. 13078 out. At 6:30 pm, he drove along the Xiaobeimenwai Pisao Nai Road, French Concession, from east to west. When he drove to the front of No. 78 on the road, Qi Derong, the six-year-old only son of the elderly Ningbo resident Qi Liansheng (the child's father is 63 years old this year) living at No. 38 Jinyuli on the road, was following his mother, Ms. Hu, out to buy things. The child was crossing the road from south to north, and at the same time avoiding it, he was knocked down and run over by Zhou's car. Zhou did not stop to rescue him and drove away at full speed. A 107th Chinese constable learned of this and rushed to the scene, but only saw the car number and could not catch up. He reported to the police station and sent the injured child to Renji Hospital. He died before he could be treated. The vehicle office reported the body to the Second Special District Court for verification and ordered it to be buried. The vehicle office sent personnel to the scene of the accident and found several pieces of broken glass from the car lights, which were brought to the case. They sent detectives to investigate and arrest the driver of the car. Later, the car involved in the accident was found in No. 244, Bairu Road, and taken to the police station. The car owner was ordered to summon Zhou Haitao, who was hiding in the railway hotel on Beiche Station Road, so detectives were sent to arrest Zhou and brought him to the Second Special District Court for questioning. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case, and prosecuted according to Article 291 of the Criminal Law for negligent homicide. The victim's parents hired Wang Shizong as their agent to file an incidental private prosecution. Interrogated the defendant Zhou Haitao, who confessed that he did not see a child crossing the road in front of the car at the time, and did not know that he had hit and killed the child. The witnesses, including the 107th patrolman Yang Afu and Meng Sizhen, were also summoned for questioning. Judge Qiu Huanrong verified the confession and ordered the defendants to be taken back into custody and rescheduled for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Nun Accuses Blind Clairvoyant of Assault</h3>
<p>Private Savings Were Cheated and Expelled</p>
<p>Defendant Denies Assault and Fraud</p>
<p>Yu Hu, a Buddhist nun from Suzhou, 59 years old this year, who lives in a certain Buddhist hall at No. 11 Ziyang Lane, Annajin Road, French Concession, reported to the Xiafei Road Police Station the day before yesterday that on the 15th, at 6:00 am, the woman was chanting scriptures in the Buddhist hall upstairs when she was suddenly slapped twice on the face by the abbot of the Buddhist hall, namely the clairvoyant Lu Xiangtian (33 years old this year, from Jiangbei) for no reason, and then kicked and punched, causing injuries. She requested detention for interrogation. The police chief approved the request and sent detective Li Baoquan to arrest Lu and brought him to the Second Special District Court for questioning. The defendant was ordered to post bail and was rescheduled for further interrogation after the victim's injuries were examined. Yesterday, Judge Wu Fanglian continued the trial in the eighth criminal court. The plaintiff Yu Hu stated first that the woman had practiced Buddhism in her early years and recited scriptures devoutly. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the defendant Lu Xiangtian saw that I had money in my hand, so he coveted it and volunteered to worship me as his mother and took me to live in his Buddhist hall. Unexpectedly, the defendant gradually defrauded the woman of all her savings of 730 yuan, and then had bad intentions. He wanted to drive me out but failed, so he assaulted and beat me. Li Jinzhang can testify. The official then summoned the witness Li Jinzhang to the court to testify that he had witnessed the defendant assault and beat the plaintiff. The plaintiff's agent lawyer also requested an incidental private prosecution to recover the defrauded money and medical expenses. Interrogated the defendant Lu Xiangtian, who confessed that he was blind. The plaintiff came to my place as a pilgrim and helped take care of the door because she had no one to rely on. He did not cheat her of money or beat her. It was a false accusation. He requested a clear investigation. The court verified the confession and immediately announced the end of the debate, and scheduled the sentence for the 26th. The defendant was still released on the original bail.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Who Kidnapped Wei Tingrong Resentenced Yesterday After Serving Their Terms</h3>
<p>All Three Robbers Denied Participating in the Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>The Judge Instructed That If They Were Indeed Guilty, the Sentence Would Be Increased</p>
<p>Wei Tingrong, the former commander of the Chinese Volunteer Corps of the French Concession, Chinese Director of the French Engineering Bureau, manager of the Sino-French Bank, and native of Ningbo, was kidnapped at 11:00 am on July 24, 1929, i.e., the year of the Republic of China. After finishing work at the Sino-French Bank, he took his two sons home in his private car. He was suddenly kidnapped and taken to the countryside of Pudong, where he was held for ransom. He was held in the bandit's den for a month. Later, the French Police ordered the dispatch of Chinese and Western detectives from the general class to go to the countryside of Pudong with the Public Security Bureau to search. They were able to rescue him and arrest three members of the gang, Zhu Jingcheng, Chen Zhongheng, and Tang Shiliang. After interrogation by the former French Public Concession, the three defendants Zhu, Chen, and Tang were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment and sent to the mainland authorities for interrogation after the expiration of their terms. In August of the 20th year, two more members of the gang, Lv Ruowang (from Shaoxing) and Cai Weicai (from Nanhui), were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment and 20 years of imprisonment, respectively, after interrogation by the Second Special District Court. The details have been reported in previous reports. The three previously arrested criminals, Zhu Jingcheng, Chen Zhongheng, and Tang Shiliang, have now completed their original five-year prison terms. The Second Special District Prison has prepared a document to transfer the three criminals Zhu, Chen, and Tang to the Second Special District Court for review. Yesterday morning at 10:00 am, Judge Qiu Huanrong presided over the interrogation in the first criminal court. The police side was represented by lawyer Gu Shouxi. According to the defendant Zhu Jingcheng, in the 18th year of the Republic of China, he was in Anhui Province, not in Shanghai. He knew nothing about the kidnapping of Wei Tingrong. He was arrested because Cai Weicai implicated him, and the police forced him to confess by torture. He was sentenced to five years of imprisonment by the former French Public Concession. Now that the term has expired, he requests release to redress his grievances. Chen Zhongheng confessed that in the 18th year of the Republic of China, he went to Hangzhou to see the exhibition. He met Lv Ruowang by chance and went to the hotel where Lv lived to ask Lv for the money he owed, but it was not returned. He was then arrested by the Bao Detective and did not know anything about the kidnapping of Wei. The official asked Chen, according to Cai Weicai, you were on the scene as a lookout when Wei was kidnapped. Chen replied that it was a false accusation. Tang Shiliang confessed that in the 18th year of the Republic of China, he was an assistant in the Minsheng Hospital run by Lv Ruowang and did not know about the kidnapping of Wei. His remaining words were vague. After the lawyer hired by Zhu and others stated the case, the court ordered the defendants to be taken back into custody and wait for verification. At this point, the defendants all claimed that our prison terms had expired more than two months ago and we should be released. The official said that if the investigation shows that you did commit the kidnapping, then the prison term will have to be increased, how can it be so cheap? When Zhu and others heard the instruction, they still wanted to argue, but were taken down by the bailiffs and returned to the court.</p>

Participating manufacturers are also very enthusiastic. It is reported that the association plans to start construction of the site on the 24th, building a total of 160 rooms, with the project scheduled to be completed on the 29th. It has also applied to the Public Works Bureau for the issuance of a construction permit to facilitate construction as scheduled. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Participation Since the announcement of the registration at the registration office of Yongji Lane, West Road of the Association, quite a few national goods manufacturers from this city and other cities have come to register.

The original document stated, "Submitting a document for the construction of the South Shanghai National Goods Exhibition site, requesting approval for the issuance of a construction permit to facilitate the promotion of national goods.

<h3>Economic Difficulties, Wife Newly Delivered, Young Man Takes Risks</h3>
<p>Holds a Bomb to Intimidate a Foreign Goods Store</p>
<p>Clerk Follows and Summons Police, Apprehends Him</p>
<p>Yichangxiang Foreign Goods Store at No. 45 Huade Road, at 8:45 p.m. the night before, a customer from Zhenjiang, Zhou Taibing, 22 years old, suddenly came in. After selecting six sections of rayon silk fabric worth 52.10 yuan, he took out a piece of paper from his side with the words "Iron-Blood Anti-Traitor Warning" and placed it on the counter, saying that the store sold inferior goods and that it must be taken to the No. 225 Yongji Lane Office of Fangbang Bridge in the Chinese area to check whether it was inferior goods. He also intimidated the store with a bomb and escaped. The store clerks Jiang Heming, Chen Tingkang, and Chen Xingsheng chased him to the vicinity of Zhoushan Road, frantically blowing their whistles. The Chinese detective Liu Baoshan and two Chinese constables, No. 41 and No. 3001, apprehended him. He threw the silk fabric bomb on the side of the road and was taken to the Huishan Concession Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The lawyer of the Engineering Bureau, Li Zhishan, stated that the defendant said at the police station that he lived at No. 19 Changzhou Road and used to sell hardware and sundries on the road, earning very little profit. Now his wife has just given birth to a child, and the end of the year is approaching, making it impossible to maintain his livelihood. He went to the store to seek profit under false pretenses. He picked up the bomb during the January 28th Shanghai Incident after the 19th Route Army and found it somewhere. Police officers have already gone to his home to investigate and found a woman in bed with a child. No other explosives were found, only several cards from his friend, a soldier of the 19th Route Army. The bomb was immersed in water at the inspection office for fear of danger. The forged "Iron-Blood Anti-Traitor" note was presented for inspection. Then, according to the clerks Jiang Heming, etc., the process was verified. The defendant's confession was the same as that stated by the lawyer Li, that he was acting out of economic difficulties and taking this measure. The judge Xiao Xiefen ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for investigation.</p>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau previously conducted tuberculin skin tests in elementary schools, and the Education Bureau designated five schools in South Shanghai, including Danhua, He'an, Songxue, Shangwen, and Weida, to conduct the tests on a selected day. The South Shanghai District Health Office requested Dr. Gao Jinglang from the Red Cross Society to conduct the test. The results were as follows: The total number of students tested at Danhua Elementary School was 426, with 347 reacting and only 79 not reacting, a percentage of 81.4. The total number of students tested at He'an Elementary School was 1,037, with 837 reacting and 200 not reacting, a percentage of 80.7. The total number of students tested at Songxue Elementary School was 197, with 156 reacting and 41 not reacting, a percentage of 70.18. The institute was extremely surprised by the high percentage of reactions in the test results, which shows the severity of the spread of germs. Nurses have now been dispatched to monitor the boys who reacted, and the parents of each student have been notified to pay attention and seek medical treatment as soon as possible. The institute will also dispatch doctors to examine the students who reacted with X-rays to determine the symptoms and then treat them separately.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Hunting Society Grand Hunt News</h3>
<p>First Grand Hunt Returns Successfully</p>
<p>Second Grand Hunt Scheduled to Depart</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hunting Society's first grand hunt in Ningbo returned to Shanghai a few days ago with great success. Yesterday, a general meeting of members was held on the third floor of the Continental Department Store to discuss the second grand hunt and report on the first hunt. The chairman, Liu Jiugao, and the recorder, Weng Wenyi. The chairman briefly stated that although the association obtained a large number of hunted items such as deer, roe deer, pheasants, ducks, etc. during this trip to Qingshui Bridge, Ningbo, the failure to obtain giant beasts was a regret. The reason is that the mountains and forests in the area, such as Tianlong Mountain and Ma'ao, have long been stationed by professional hunters from Fenghua. Giant beasts are sensitive and have long heard the sound of gunfire and avoided entering the deep mountains. At this time, the sea wind was raging, and the valley sounds and pine waves were deafening. Even if there were giant beasts moving, they were hidden and could not be predicted. Therefore, mountain forest hunting must not only understand geography but also choose the right time to avoid failure. There are thousands of acres of paddy fields along the coast in that area, locally known as Taiqiuban. It is surrounded by large rivers and can only be crossed by boat. There are many wild geese and ducks, making it an excellent area for duck hunting, but duck hunting is often done at dusk. This time, we gained a profound lesson from this. Among the companions was Zhuo Tu</p>
<p>Zhen, a brave young man who does not smoke or drink. We hired a small boat to cross the water when hunting in that area. The wind was tight and the clouds were dense, the mountains were dark and the water was white, and the sounds of geese and ducks crisscrossed the sky. The companions each went to their best spots to shoot, but Shen Tu Zhen's hunting nature was too strong, and he did not think of returning to the team in the dark of night. We then piled up the remaining grass on the ground and lit matches to make a beacon as a signal. After waiting for an hour, we still didn't see him. It was already the beginning of the night, and the cold was pressing. We were even more anxious, thinking that this gentleman had lost his way and had neither a flashlight nor matches to light a fire to signal. The companions were all unable to distinguish directions in the dark. Helplessly, we hired three boatmen to carry flashlights and blow whistles, searching around. At half past ten, we finally brought him back. Indeed, Shen Tu Zhen's face was pale, and he had suffered a lot of fear, hunger, and exhaustion. After this night hunt, we should strictly adhere to the time and meeting place for our companions. For ourselves, we should prepare flashlights, matches, and whistles to avoid accidents. After the report, the second grand hunt was discussed. Mr. Yuan Yang'an proposed to depart by train on the evening of the 28th of this month and return to Shanghai on January 3rd of the 24th year. The hunting area was set as Fuyang as before, which was unanimously approved. Yu Jiexian, the owner of the Hangzhou Erwoxuan, used his 30 years of hunting experience to publish hunting techniques and hunting area selection, all of which were based on practical experience and theories. In addition to Mr. Yu, the new members who joined that day included the famous photographer Mr. Zhang Yuanheng and Mr. Zhou Yingshi. A total of 17 people, including Fang Bingquan, immediately signed up to go to Fuyang. Liu Jiugao, Yuan Yang'an, and Hu Daosheng were designated as members of the Fuyang Preparatory Committee. The registration period was set to end at 12:00 noon on the 27th. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 p.m. In addition, a film of the association's first grand hunt, produced by Weng Wenyi, was shown, collecting all the human and animal competitive activities in nature on the screen, which greatly enhanced the interest. One of them is selected and printed to show the general situation of hunting.</p>
<h3>Board of Directors Meeting of China-Western Pharmacy</h3>
<p>The China-Western Pharmacy on Simalu held a joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. All directors and supervisors, including Chu Minyi, Mrs. Shao Lizi, Song Guobin, and Wu Shaoting, were present. First, the general manager reported on the company's business situation for the year, and then discussed all progress matters. It is reported that the total sales amount in the 22nd year, as of the end of November, has exceeded the total amount for the entire 22nd year. In this era of sluggish market conditions, it is not easy for the company to uniquely obtain profits. The directors and supervisors were extremely satisfied after reviewing it. It was resolved that dividends will be issued in accordance with regulations before the end of January of the 24th year.</p>
<h3>Guanshengyuan Helps with Disaster Relief Today</h3>
<p>This year's severe drought has caused disasters, and the suffering people are everywhere, crying for food and help. The Guanshengyuan Catering Department on Nanjing Road, in view of this, and with the mentality of helping those who are hungry and thirsty, and fulfilling the obligations of human mutual assistance, has decided to donate all the income from wine, dishes, tea, and snacks for the entire day today, together with the extra small account and rewards, etc., to the Shanghai Relief Committee for Drought Disaster in Various Provinces, to help the disaster victims. Both labor and management are doing their best for one day, without raising prices or soliciting donations.</p>
<h3>Bean and Rice Industry to Hold Elections Tomorrow</h3>
<p>North and South City Industries to Close for One Day</p>

<h3>Lei Yushang Banquets Traditional Chinese Medicine Circle Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lei Yushang Songfentang Pharmacy, the oldest pharmacy in Shanghai with a history of more than 200 years, is best known for its refined and supervised Liushen Pills, which are sold all over the world and known both in China and abroad. The store originally had two branches, Su and Shen, without any other branches. In October of this year, in order to facilitate customers in the northern city, a northern branch was specially set up in the northern territory of Tianhou Palace Bridge, with two departments for decoction pieces and ginseng bird's nest to meet the needs of all circles. At that time, celebrities from all walks of life in the Shanghai Party, government, press, and medicine circles were invited to connect. However, the Shanghai traditional Chinese medicine circle was not entertained due to the active preparations for the opening of the northern branch at that time. Mr. Lei Xianzong, the manager of the North and South branches of the pharmacy, deeply regretted this, so at 6:00 p.m. last night (22nd), he held a banquet at Dafufu Restaurant to entertain the Shanghai traditional Chinese medicine circle. Many famous doctors, including Ding Jiwan, Xia Yingtang, Ding Shenying, Wang Yongqi, and Zhu Ziyun, attended, totaling more than 100 people. The event was extremely grand. Halfway through the wine, Mr. Lei Xianzong, the host, stood up to deliver a humble speech and asked the famous doctors in the traditional Chinese medicine circle for guidance in the future to encourage them. The guests and hosts did not leave until about 9:00 p.m., when everyone had enjoyed themselves to the fullest.</p>
<h3>Grand Light Cinema Offers Free Movie Tickets to Poor Children</h3>
<p>The general manager of the Grand Light Cinema in this city sent a letter to the Chinese Childhood Association yesterday, with 180 free movie tickets attached, saying, "On this Christmas Eve, we specially present 180 free movie tickets for the poor children raised by your association to watch a movie at our cinema from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. on the 24th. This is a small expression of our sincerity, and we hope to share the joy with the poor children." This act of benefiting children is commendable.</p>
<h3>Du Xiaofan Holds Solo Exhibition</h3>

<h3>A Further Explanation of Mr. Li Fu-sun's Emphasis on Agriculture</h3>
<p>By Mu Ou-chu</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, General Manager of the Bank of China, advocated a talent-based economy and the development of the interior. Now, Mr. Li Fu-sun, General Manager of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, has also spoken of the importance of agriculture. The attention of these two major bankers in Shanghai to the economic and agricultural development of the interior is not only a guide for the financial community in Shanghai, but also a boon for the economic revival of the entire country. The *Shen Bao* editorial on December 15, "Promoting Mr. Li Fu-sun's Emphasis on Agriculture," argued that the first priority should be ensuring order and stability in rural areas, the second should be regulating rural finance, and the third should be facilitating transportation. Because the central government has strictly ordered provinces to rectify the issue of exorbitant taxes, it was not discussed. The three points raised by *Shen Bao* are indeed prerequisites for revitalizing rural areas. However, how to construct agricultural affairs themselves is even more crucial in relation to emphasizing agriculture. I would like to offer a suggestion for those concerned about rural issues to consider.</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, the emphasis on agriculture was already heard. Since the revolution, an exclusive ministry of agriculture has been in place for more than twenty years. During these three or four decades, the call for emphasizing agriculture has risen and fallen. However, in recent years, imported agricultural products, such as the rice and wheat needed for people's diets, have not only not decreased but have even increased annually. The fragmentation and decline of the rural economy have reached an irreparable extent. Why is this the case? It is because we rely on empty talk without practical work. Although the nation has established a dedicated agriculture ministry, schools, and agricultural fields, and articles on improving agricultural affairs and revitalizing agriculture have been constantly appearing before our eyes, those who practically go to the countryside to engage in reform are rare. Therefore, for three or four decades, the call to emphasize agriculture has only appeared in the talks of administrative officials and the opinions of contemporary people in newspapers, without achieving the slightest effect. The reason lies in this. Therefore, if we want to lead agriculture to the path of revitalization, it is appropriate to issue less empty talk and seek truth from facts. This is the first point.</p>
<p>One reaps melons from planting melons and beans from planting beans. The quality and yield of agricultural products cannot be deceived by empty talk. Therefore, if the implementation of agricultural policies, the training of agricultural schools, and the dissemination of agricultural fields do not obtain the right people, then not only will there be no good results, but they will also be ridiculed by knowledgeable people and old farmers. Moreover, agricultural affairs are analyzed very finely. Those who plant wheat should not engage in rice cultivation, and those who raise livestock should not engage in forestry. Even within the scope of agriculture, there are things that should not be confused. In the past, our country's agricultural fields grew all kinds of grains and raised all kinds of livestock, but no effect was achieved. Therefore, if we want to manage agriculture in the future, we should recruit specialized talents. If a person has special talent suitable for a certain province, county, or a specific aspect of agriculture, then establish an agricultural field to allow them to experiment and disseminate, and let them preside over it. This is the second point.</p>
<p>The climate varies from place to place, so there is a cotton belt and a wheat belt. The same goes for forests and animal husbandry. Therefore, those who preside over rural areas should seek overall planning, dividing the country's arable land into several regions and formulating specific plans for planting and animal husbandry for implementation. This will not only save talent and money but also achieve greater results. Recently, Chen Gongbo established the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute outside Zhongshan Gate in the capital, Xiaolingwei, opening up thousands of acres of land, gathering agricultural experts from all over the country, and dividing up the research work. Plans of many years have finally been put into practice, which is commendable. Therefore, the third key point in emphasizing agriculture is to plan holistically.</p>
<p>The Rothamsted Research Institute in England has been around for more than 120 years, and the agricultural experiment stations in the United States have been around for 60 or 70 years. Agriculture is a specialized science. With the progress of modern science, its characteristics are constantly changing. How can farming be an exception? The great Soviet botanist Michurin, as an old man of eighty, invented more than 300 new plant species through sixty years of experimentation and research. This shows that agricultural research cannot be effective overnight, and the implementation of agricultural policies also requires persistence. This is the fourth point. If the above four points are all put into practice, can the countryside hope to recover? Not yet. Even if agricultural production increases, and investment is adequate, and it can be self-sufficient, given the strict tariff barriers in various countries today, and the competitive selling and dumping of agricultural products, if there is a bumper harvest, and agricultural prices fall, then farmers will still have no means of survival. Therefore, if our country's industry is not prosperous, even if there is a good harvest, it will still be difficult to achieve real results. The Soviet Union was originally an agricultural country. In recent years, its economy has become increasingly prosperous, which is unmatched by other countries in the world. This is because it has industrialized its agriculture, and the prosperity of industry has helped the development of agriculture. As a result, agriculture has become more prosperous, complementing each other. If both agriculture and industry thrive, then commerce will flourish, national power will be strengthened, and the national economy will also become prosperous. Therefore, emphasizing agriculture should also include emphasizing industry.</p>
<p>Our country's farmers are scattered throughout the country, accounting for the largest majority of the national population. Due to economic constraints and a lack of knowledge and skills, they are always in a passive position. They cannot avoid floods and droughts, and they dare not speak out about exorbitant taxes. In recent years, the impact of the world agricultural panic has made the suffering of farmers increasingly severe. They are left to die in ditches and have nowhere to complain, unlike the industrial and commercial sectors, which can still appeal in a roundabout way. Our country was founded on agriculture, yet the suffering of farmers is so great. Is this not a painful thing? Therefore, if we want to save the countryside today, we must especially rectify domestic governance. If politics are put on the right track, then agriculture will naturally thrive.</p>

<h3>Minister of Education Wang Shijie Discusses Implementing Compulsory Education in 1935</h3>
<p>Drafting a Plan Based on the Resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Requesting Allocation of a Large Portion of the Boxer Indemnity from the United States, Britain, France, and Belgium</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 22nd) Wang Shijie discussed the Fifth Plenary Session and said that the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Education to popularize compulsory education throughout the country has been resolved and handed over to the Central Standing Committee for handling. The Ministry of Education is now following the spirit of the resolution and drafting a plan for promoting compulsory education in various provinces and cities, which will be promulgated and implemented starting in 1935. At the third joint meeting of various Boxer Indemnity agencies on the afternoon of the 21st, I proposed allocating a large portion of the Boxer Indemnity from the United States, Britain, Belgium, and France for the funding of promoting compulsory education, and a small portion for promoting secondary vocational education and subsidizing the sound research institutes of various universities. Although a general decision has been made, the Boxer Indemnities of various countries have their own special diplomatic relations, so the final decision on the amount still needs to be negotiated with the various Boxer Indemnity agencies. According to a reporter's investigation, the boards of directors of the various Boxer Indemnities have their own diplomatic backgrounds, and the content of the storage and use of the funds is complex and difficult to determine. For example, Zeng Zongchang is in charge of the Sino-Italian Boxer Indemnity, and it is said that the Italian Indemnity has been completely used up. The Sino-Dutch Indemnity has been used as the construction cost of the Jing City Waterway. The actual Boxer Indemnities are those of the United States, Britain, Belgium, and France. On the morning of the 21st, the Ministry of Education first invited the leaders of the Boxer Indemnity agencies of the United States, Britain, Belgium, and France to hold a review meeting at the Ministry of Education to discuss the proposal first. In the afternoon, a third joint meeting was held at the Executive Yuan. Although there was a formal resolution on the proposal of the Ministry of Education, the attendees did not have full power to represent the will of their respective Boxer Indemnity agencies, so it is difficult to reach a definitive conclusion on the resolution.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Various Boxer Indemnities Decides to Allocate Funds to Subsidize Compulsory Vocational Schools</h3>
<p>The third joint meeting of the boards of directors of the Sino-British, Sino-American, Sino-French, Sino-Belgian, and Sino-Dutch Boxer Indemnities was held in Beijing the day before yesterday. It was decided to allocate funds to subsidize the Ministry of Education's development of compulsory and vocational education throughout the country, among other important proposals. A *Shen Shi* reporter met with a committee member who attended the meeting yesterday and learned the following details:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: The attendees of this joint meeting included Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, representatives of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Association Zhu Jiahua and Hang Liwu, representatives of the Sino-American Boxer Indemnity Association Ren Hongjun and Ding Wenjiang, representatives of the Sino-French Boxer Indemnity Association Li Shuhua and Shen Yinmo, representatives of the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Association Zeng Zongjian and Zhu Shiquan, representatives of the Sino-Dutch Boxer Indemnity Association Shi Ying, etc., chaired by President Wang.</p>
<p>General Assembly Proposals: The general assembly was held in Beijing on the 20th of this month. First, representatives of the various Boxer Indemnity boards of directors reported on (1) the budget and explanation of educational and cultural undertakings for the 22nd year. At that time, the resolutions of the second meeting were also discussed and processed. The general assembly continued on the afternoon of the 21st at 3:00 PM. The Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and the Rural Revitalization Committee all made proposals. It was decided that (1) the annual income and expenditure reports of the various Boxer Indemnity boards of directors should be submitted to the Executive Yuan, (2) the various Boxer Indemnity boards of directors should allocate funds to subsidize the Ministry of Education's development of compulsory and vocational education. The meeting closed yesterday morning, and the results were very satisfactory.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Staff Farewell Former Director Ye</h3>

<h3>News from the China Educational Film Association</h3>
<p>The China Educational Film Association has purchased 30 sets of international educational films and added Chinese subtitles to them. A low rental method has been established for widespread promotion. The films are divided into six groups, and each group charges a rental fee of only 15 yuan per day. They have been screened by the Nanjing Youth Association, Jiaotong University, Wuhan University, Xiamen University, and schools at all levels in Tianjin City, and have been well received. In order to actively promote educational films in Beijing, the association is negotiating with the Beijing authorities to implement educational film measures starting in January next year. In view of the need for educational films in our country, the association has specially sent a letter to the Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors, requesting a subsidy of 150,000 yuan from the interest on the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity, which is allocated to subsidize educational and cultural undertakings, to plan and produce (1) a film on the industrial plan written by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, (2) films on supplementary teaching materials selected from excellent textbooks, and (5) health films. As soon as the Boxer Indemnity Association approves the subsidy, it can be started. Also, the association believes that although the film industry in our country is gradually developing, most domestic film companies have meager capital and lack talent. From a positive perspective, the government should provide considerable assistance within the possible range. From a negative perspective, the government should also protect and reward it, so that the budding sprouts can grow and thrive. Therefore, based on the resolution of the annual meeting, it is requested that the central government formulate laws and regulations to protect the Chinese film industry, and guarantee the copyright of film scripts. In addition, the film yearbook compiled by the association will be published soon. The price is five yuan, and the pre-order price is only two yuan and eight jiao. The deadline for pre-orders is the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Educational Film Association Seeks to Improve the Fee Collection Method for Educational Films</h3>
<p>Schools Find it Inconvenient to Collect Educational Film Fees on Behalf</p>
<p>The Original Method of Collecting Travel Expenses May Be Restored</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Branch of the China Educational Film Association started screening educational films in various schools every quarter, it has been quite effective. However, this work requires a lot of expenses, so when it was first screened, the association stipulated a method of collecting travel expenses based on the distance of the route, and each school paid the travel expenses each time it was screened to subsidize the expenses. Since the beginning of this semester, the association has applied to the Ministry of Education to collect educational film fees from schools at all levels within the urban area of the city. Primary school students pay two jiao per person, secondary school students pay five jiao per person, and university students pay one yuan per person. Paying the fee once means that they can always watch the educational films screened by the association for free until they graduate. The method is very good, and the burden on students is also light. The association also keeps this fee in custody by a special person and uses it as a fund, without using it. However, since its implementation, many people have been enthusiastic about paying the fee, but many have not paid the fee. The schools that have paid the fee feel it is inconvenient to collect it on their behalf. The Shanghai University Federation and the Shanghai Education Association have first put forward their opinions to improve the fee collection method. It is said that the association is currently discussing whether to restore the original method of collecting travel expenses.</p>

<h3>Sixth District Education Association Requests Improvement of the Title for Teachers</h3>
<p>Municipal Education Bureau Has Forwarded it to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Consulting the Ministries of Interior and Education for Instructions</p>
<p>The Sixth District Education Association of this city, in view of the fact that school teachers are mentors of the people's education in the country, and their status is quite respected. Students in schools generally call them "Sir." However, the title of "Sir" is a commonly used verbal title in society.

Therefore, after deliberation by the Board of Directors, it was decided to change the title of "Sir" to "Teacher." It has been submitted to the Education Bureau. It is said that the Education Bureau has forwarded it to the Municipal Government and requested that it be forwarded to the Ministries of Interior and Education for instructions.</p>

Chairman Liu took the stage to give a speech, saying that the reason why the effect of China's education, which has been carried out for decades, is not very significant is that most people only know how to use their brains and do not know how to use their hands. Now, your school advocates the combination of hands and brains, teaching students to study and work at the same time, which is very good. I hope that the teachers and students of your school will work even harder to be a model for vocational schools everywhere, so that Chinese education can be fully vocationalized to save the country and the nation from danger. Then, Chairman Jiang Wenyu gave a thank you speech and dispersed. Later, Liu specially entrusted the school's civil engineering department to design a residence and two primary and secondary school buildings, and to plan the curriculum as a reference for opening the school.</p>

<h3>Xiqing Basketball Game Results Yesterday</h3>
<p>There were four Xiqing basketball games last night. The B1 group game between Tax College and Xiqing B was postponed due to some reason. In the A group game, Yishi defeated Zhizhi with a score of 51 to 43. The scores of both sides were quite close. Zhizhi tried hard to catch up in the second half but failed and lost by eight points. The results last night are as follows:</p>
<p>Competing Teams　Group　Result</p>
<p>Zhengfeng Defeated Jinan　C Group　27 to 26</p>

<p>Feixia Defeated Leidian　B2　48 to 18</p>
<p>Yishi Defeated Zhizhi　A Group　51 to 43</p>
<p>The main reason for Zhizhi's failure was their slow movements. They hesitated and did not advance after getting the ball, thus missing the opportunity to attack. Yishi's performance yesterday was also not tight, so both sides scored easily. In the first half, Yishi took the lead with 27 to 19, leading by eight points. In the second half, Zhizhi quickly caught up, and Yishi was unwilling to show weakness. This advance and center formed a balanced situation. When the whole game ended, the score was 51 to 43, and victory still belonged to Yishi.</p>

<h3>Wuxi China Sports Federation Football Final, Provincial Xishi vs. Furen To Decide the Winner Again</h3>
<p>Draw of 2-2 the Other Day, Replay Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, a letter was received from the Wuxi China Sports Federation, which stated that the content of the Wuxi Secondary School Sports Federation Football Championship published in the sports news column of your newspaper on the 20th of this month, stating that the provincial Xishi won the championship on the 16th, is inconsistent with the facts. It is suspected to be a mistake in the rumor. It was found that the provincial Xishi and Furen competed at that time, and the result was a 2-2 draw. Later, due to slight disorder in the order, the extended competition could not be continued. Now, the Sports Federation has convened an interim representative meeting and decided to refer to the referee Wang Yimin's report. The result was a 1-2 draw and should be rescheduled for a replay. It has now been scheduled to convene both parties at the railway station at 2:00 PM on the 23rd of this month to hold the final again to determine the winner. Please correct it immediately to avoid confusing the audience. Sincerely, Wuxi Secondary School Sports Federation.</p>
<h3>Chunhe Factory Promotes Sports</h3>

<h3>Hopes for Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Now, this year is about to pass! Next year, which is designated as Children's Year, is about to begin! Children, of course, need to be invigorated for this Children's Year, so that it becomes a Children's Year of honor. But how should children proceed? Now I offer a few suggestions.</p>
<p>First: I hope that children can promote domestic products, because next year is not only Children's Year; it is also Student Domestic Goods Year; all Chinese should use domestic products. Therefore, this year we must do it practically and start from you and your family.</p>
<p>Second: You must study hard, because "Saving the country requires studying, studying is saving the country." Children must understand this meaning and must not neglect studying on the pretext of saving the country.</p>
<p>Third: We must practice the New Life Movement, especially paying attention to cleanliness and thrift. For clothes, only cloth clothes are needed, neatly and cleanly dressed; why wear silk and satin?</p>
<p>Children's Year is approaching, and I hope you will be good children in Children's Year.</p>
<h3>Little Teacher</h3>
<p>— Xidan</p>
<p>Children, do you know who the little teachers are? They are the students in the schools of the Hebei Province Dingxian People's Education Experimental Zone. Because there are too many illiterate people in China, the Hebei Province Dingxian People's Education Experimental Zone called the students in the schools to be teachers of "illiterate villagers," and used their spare time to guide illiterate villagers to read. Although those little teachers are young, they are diligent in service, sincerely and tirelessly teaching villagers to read, and have made many good achievements in promoting people's education in Dingxian, and are still actively promoting it.</p>
<p>Children, what do you think of the facts above? I tell you; this kind of education is indeed an important work for saving the country today, and we can certainly participate in its success, so we must imitate the methods of the little teachers, and call us to go to the countryside to teach ordinary out-of-school children, teach them to read, this is indeed a great mission, but this really wants you to teach people you don't know to read, and at the same time go a long way to teach them to read. As long as our relatives or friends have not received education, or have received very shallow education, then we can implement this kind of beneficial work, isn't this a good way? Finally, I sincerely hope that the children can put it into practice.</p>
<h3>Exhortation to Study Song</h3>
<p>— Dai Jimin</p>
<p>Exhortation to study, exhortation to study, a man's diligence in learning is heroic. Everything in the world should be done, and nothing in the world is unbreakable. Strive to move forward endlessly, learning is vast, the sea is wide and the sky is high, I sincerely exhort you to study hard.</p>
<p>Exhortation to study, exhortation to study, I advise you not to be just leisurely. Bad habits are formed because of laziness, and time is wasted only because of laziness. Strive to move forward with good morals, the future is vast and full of hope, I sincerely exhort you to study hard.</p>
<p>Exhortation to study, exhortation to study, the teacher is only here to enlighten you. Ten percent of the knowledge is taught by the teacher, and a hundred times the effort is done by yourself. Strive to move forward and shine, knowledge is enriched and fully understood, I sincerely exhort you to study hard.</p>
<h3>Getting Up Early</h3>
<p>— Bingying</p>
<p>It is winter now, and everyone shouts when the north wind blows on their faces: "It's cold! It's cold!" Rich children are wearing sweaters knitted by their mothers or sisters at this time, and poor children are also wearing cotton-padded jackets added by their dear mothers.</p>
<p>Everyone likes to sleep in a warm quilt, and children often hide in the quilt and refuse to get up; now, many children in school are often late, and only children who don't want to improve are willing to be late! Late is the most shameful noun!</p>
<p>The air is very fresh in the morning. Exercising in the morning is very beneficial to our health, so people who get up early are very healthy. In the morning, our minds are very clear, and it is easiest to remember when reading, so children who get up early have excellent grades. In the morning, the sun rises in the east, the clouds are brilliant, and the birds sing on the branches, the music is beautiful, so people who get up early are very happy. "The plan for the day is in the morning," the morning is the most important time of the day, and we must not waste it!</p>
<p>Children, we must get up early, we must exercise in the morning, we must read in the morning, and do not stay in bed and waste this precious morning; we know that every diligent child gets up very early, we know that every healthy child gets up very early, children, let's all get up early, only lazy cats hide in the quilt in the morning.</p>
<h3>The Candy-Selling Boy</h3>
<p>— Yangzijiang</p>
<p>I go to school from the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Route Mettemhorst every day, and I also come home from the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Route Mettemhorst every day.</p>
<p>Right below the low wall at that corner, there is a candy-selling boy sitting on the ground. I see him four times a day, and unless it is cloudy or raining, he sits there regularly.</p>
<p>He sells sesame candy. A silk basket is placed on the ground in front of him, with some flattened and some stacked. Sometimes he leisurely shouts:</p>
<p>Do you want to buy sesame candy, three copper coins a piece, three copper coins a piece!</p>
<p>Sometimes he doesn't make a sound, just silently and attentively reading a book. A candy-selling boy who can read and can read so consistently is something I have never seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>What book is he reading? I didn't see clearly, and I was always in a hurry and didn't have time to ask him.</p>
<p>There are out-of-school children everywhere in society, but there are not many who work hard like that candy-selling boy. The motive for writing this article is to hope that many children will learn from the candy-selling boy and increase their interest in reading!</p>
<h3>Restraint</h3>
<p>— Yian</p>
<h3>Children's Science Lecture Series</h3>
<p>— Linyin</p>
<p>Another thing we need in our lives is the issue of "movement." The primary event of movement is "roads" (Figure 1). Without roads, people have no way to walk. Even with the tools of movement (cars), there is no way to solve it. With roads, we can use the tools of movement. In cities, we generally use cars for land transportation. There are many types of cars (Figure 2). For long distances, we can also use trains. Human progress, everything is invented according to need. The problem of land movement has been solved, and water movement has also progressed following the land. The invention of ships and the progress to steamships (Figure 3) are still great achievements. We only talk about the improvement of roads and the progress of ships and cars. This issue of movement has already demonstrated human wisdom.</p>
<p>Clearing roads from forests is already a great invention, because mud roads are slippery and uneven, stone roads are easily broken at varying heights, and then building roads with sand, stone, cement, and asphalt makes our walking comfortable. Then, we felt the fatigue of walking, so we invented animal-drawn carts from wheelbarrows. Human life has reached its extreme comfort; however, due to the relationship between speed, we used rickshaws, bicycles, and even trams, cars, and trains. Our ancestors really never dreamed in their dreams that the progress of life had reached the highest level.</p>
<p>In terms of waterways, dugout canoes for crossing rivers were already a great convenience for people. Now, we can use electricity and steam power, and the speed per hour has increased from half a mile to hundreds of miles. Could the people of the early days have imagined this?</p>
<p>But, children! We are now enjoying the happiness inherited from our predecessors. What do we inherit to our descendants?</p>
<h3>How to Pay Attention to Hygiene in Winter?</h3>
<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>Little friends, winter and summer are the two seasons that require the most care. Summer epidemics include cholera, vomiting, and diarrhea, while winter ailments are colds and coughs. These seem like minor ailments not worth mentioning, but catching them can be very uncomfortable and even lead to dangerous, incurable conditions.</p>
<p>Little friends, rather than carelessly catching an illness and seeking medical treatment with bitter medicine, wouldn't it be better to pay attention beforehand? The following are some winter hygiene methods:</p>
<p>(1) When coming out of a warm place, avoid exposing your body to the cold immediately, or you will easily catch a cold.</p>
<p>(2) In severely cold weather, open windows and doors less often to avoid cold drafts.</p>
<p>(3) Get up early, walk in a place with fresh air, and do a few minutes of breathing exercises facing the sun.</p>
<p>(4) When thirsty, it is best to drink clean boiled water, without tea leaves.</p>
<p>(5) If someone at home has a cold, their rice bowls, teacups, and chopsticks should be separated to prevent the risk of infection.</p>
<p>(6) More exercise in winter can strengthen the body and increase the skin's resistance. (But be sure not to get cold after exercise, or you will get a severe cold.)</p>
<h3>Where Does Gold Come From?</h3>
<p>— Ding He</p>
<p>Gold! We all know it. The yellow rings that our parents wear on their fingers are made of gold. But where does gold come from? We don't all know.</p>
<p>Now I'll tell you: Gold is mined from mines. What is mined is not pure gold but is mixed with other metals, called ore. Although sometimes pure gold is mined, it is extremely rare.</p>
<p>There are two ways to make pure gold from ore. The first method is to dissolve the ore or gold sand into a liquid with chemical solutions and then add other chemicals to precipitate the pure gold. Electricity can also be used to separate the pure gold. The second method is to strongly heat and melt the ore or gold sand, and then add other substances to separate the pure gold and impurities. Pure gold is the gold used to make jewelry.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we should remember the gold-producing areas in our country, such as Chengde, Guishan in Shandong, and Guanxian and Anxian in Sichuan. These are all gold-producing areas, but we rarely mine them. Isn't that a pity?</p>
<h3>Steadiness and Luck</h3>
<p>— Zhang Nancun</p>
<p>A candy-spinning stall, with a shoulder pole, was resting by the roadside. Hanging from the stall were sugar figures of people, birds, and beasts, decorated with red and green colors, easily attracting the attention of children. As a result, many children surrounded the candy stall, watching.</p>
<p>The candy-stall man held a small wooden stick on his table and spun it around, singing in a melodious voice, "One copper coin to spin for a prize..." He sang for a long time, but many children did not show much interest.</p>
<p>Hai'er saw a candy lion that looked fun, so he bought it for the price. Hai'er's friend, Tan'er, said, "You were fooled. If you could get a prize by spinning for just one copper coin, that would be so cheap. Why pay more money to buy it?"</p>
<p>Tan'er took a fancy to a candy Arhat and put a copper coin on the base of the candy Arhat, hoping to win a prize by spinning. So, he spun it once, twice... until more than ten times, but he never won. The money his mother had given him to buy snacks in his small pocket all ended up in the candy-stall man's pocket.</p>
<p>Tan'er was angry and anxious. He couldn't help but say, "It's really unlucky. I didn't get the candy Arhat, and my snack money is gone. I can't tell Mom about this. I'll just have to go hungry without eating snacks." He looked very distressed.</p>
<p>Hai'er comforted him, saying, "Luck is the seed of failure. Because I remember this saying, I embrace a steady approach. I would rather pay the price to buy it than try to get it cheap by spinning and hoping for luck. These kinds of spinning games are all deception and temptation. From now on, let's ignore them. They won't be able to trick us into being fooled."</p>
<p>Hai'er still had money left in his pocket, so he treated Tan'er to some snacks. Tan'er was very grateful to Hai'er. After that, whenever they encountered lottery-like stalls on the road, they would avoid them as if they were poisonous snakes and fierce beasts, not even daring to look.</p>
<h3>Air Pressure Crushes a Tin Can</h3>
<p>— Jing'an</p>
<p>Little friends! This is a very interesting experiment. All you need is a basin, filled with cold water, a sealed tin can, and a cork.</p>
<p>First, make a small hole in the middle of the top of the can and pour in a quarter of water. Heat it over a fire to boil, then tightly seal the hole with a cork (if it's not tight, use sealing wax or something else to seal it). Put it into cold water. After about five or six minutes, there will be a scraping sound, and the tin can will suddenly be crushed.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the inside of the tin can only has a quarter of water. After being boiled, the steam completely drives out all the air inside the can. After sealing the can, only steam is inside. Putting it into a basin of cold water cools the steam, which turns into cold water in about five or six minutes. The tin can becomes a vacuum. We know that air pressure is very high, about fifteen pounds of pressure per square inch. The can cools, and there is nothing inside except a little water. Subject to the pressure of the atmosphere, it is crushed with a scraping sound. The reason why the can is crushed is because of the pressure of the large amount of air outside.</p>
<p>Little Brain Teaser</p>
<h3>Five Bowls of Water</h3>
<p>— Yan Xinquan</p>
<p>Mr. Shen held five bowls in his hand, placing them one by one on the table. He then scooped a basin of water and poured it evenly into the five bowls. He took out paper and pen and assigned a temperature to each bowl of water. The assigned numbers were seventeen degrees for the first bowl, twenty-one degrees for the second bowl, thirty-four degrees for the third bowl, forty-two degrees for the fourth bowl, and fifty-one degrees for the fifth bowl. He said to Chun Ge, Xia Jie, Qiu Di, and Dong Mei, "Now I ask you, which bowl of water should be mixed with which bowl of water, or is there a simpler method, to make the temperature of these five bowls of water average?"</p>
<p>Chun Ge, Xia Jie, Qiu Di, and Dong Mei all thought hard, thinking for more than ten minutes but could not come up with an answer. They had to ask Mr. Shen to tell them. Mr. Shen said, "This method is very easy. Just pour all five bowls of water with different temperatures into the basin, stir them evenly, and then scoop them back into the bowls. Wouldn't the temperature of the five bowls of water be average then?"</p>
<p>The four children clapped their hands and said, "Ah! That's right, that's right."</p>
<h3>Children's Science Game: Cooking an Egg in a Paper Pot</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Little friends! Are you busy with your studies at school? I think: now there's nothing in nature to look at, isn't that boring? Even if you are busy with your studies, can't you spare one or two hours to do this very strange scientific game? Also, you can cook and eat the egg yourself, and knowing whether it's cooked or not can increase your understanding of many physical principles. Why wouldn't we do this?</p>
<p>The experimental method is extremely simple, and everyone can do it. Just make a pot shape out of drawing paper, tie it to a tripod, pour water into the pot, and add an egg. Then, burn an alcohol lamp underneath. After a few minutes, the water will boil and the egg will be cooked. Hey! Little friends! Do you find this strange? When you burn paper, shouldn't it burn? No, no, it's not like that. This is a matter of physical principles. Let me tell you the reason!</p>
<p>The pots we usually use are made of iron because metals are not easily ignited. Why? Because metals easily conduct heat, and when one part is lit, the heat spreads throughout the entire pot. Wood is the opposite, so paper made of wood fiber cannot be used. So, why can we cook an egg in a paper pot without burning the paper? Because to burn something, that thing must absorb heat. But to burn the paper pot, the contents of the pot must first absorb most of the heat, leaving not enough to burn the paper pot. You see, if we soak paper in water and throw it into the fire, the paper won't burn until the water evaporates. The reason why the paper pot can cook the egg without burning is this principle.</p>
<p>Little friends! This Sunday, use your playtime to do this science game. On one hand, you can increase your scientific knowledge, and on the other hand, you can practice your scientific experimental skills. In this way, you will surely gain many benefits and interests. This is something you must experiment with yourself, so I hope you will experiment as soon as possible!</p>

<h3>Traitors Among the Oppressed</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xue</p>
<p>丨丨Miss Chen Xiangjun of Tianjin and her maid, Lianxi丨丨</p>
<p>Women are the most typical of the oppressed and exploited. Housewives can be seen as a microcosm of the oppressed in the whole society. In the family, there are rulers, plunderers, pleasure-seekers, and also the ruled and plundered sufferers. Women丨丨from housewives to maids, belong to the latter category.</p>
<p>Today, we can say that under economic and male dependence, women are all, without exception, oppressed.</p>
<p>However, even though that is said, there are always exceptions. The oppressed can also often be oppressors. These people share some of the plunderers' spoils from their parasitic status, so they forget the enemy and forget their own position. Not only that, but they emulate their enemies, inflicting a kind of oppression and extortion on their companions. The enemy becomes their companion, and the companion becomes their enemy. Without the slightest resentment towards the enemy and without the slightest sympathy towards the companion, they become the enemy's most vicious helpers and henchmen. It is perhaps not too much to say that such people are more hateful than the enemy.</p>
<p>We view incidents such as mothers-in-law oppressing daughters-in-law and housewives abusing maids in this way.</p>
<p>On the 13th, the newspaper reported on the news of Miss Chen Xiangjun of Tianjin and her mother, Chen Xu, abusing their maid. The story is like this: the seven-year-old maid, Lianxi, usually "spread hemp bags" and "sleep on the floor" in a "dark room," eat "leftovers," and is also beaten every day "for reasons unknown," burned on the buttocks with hot tongs, burned on the head with cigarette butts, and stabbed in the face with bone needles.</p>
<p>When we see this news, we inevitably feel stimulated, but when we calm down, we feel that there is really no need to be surprised. There are actually many more things like this! This is just a drop in the ocean. This kind of thing happens in any time and space. Maids and servants are the lowest level of the oppressed. They are oppressed by the oppressed, and they often have to be oppressed by the "traitors" among the oppressed who are several levels above them. As long as this system of exploitation exists, these kinds of things will not only not happen, but it will be impossible to even call them to "happen" less.</p>
<p>However, there is a question and answer in this news that I find very interesting: The judge asked, "Did you beat her because she was naughty?" Lianxi replied, "I'm not naughty. Because I went to the neighbor's, Old Man Huang's, house, Chen Xu went to beat me, and Old Man Huang held me back. Later, Old Man Huang sent me back, Chen Xiangjun blocked my mouth, pressed me down, and Chen Xu beat me with a rattan cane." The implication seems to be that if Lianxi was naughty, she deserved to be beaten. It can be seen that a person who hires a maid, hiring a maid is of course legal, and if the maid is naughty, it is still excusable to hit her. What the law wants to punish is only when the maid is not naughty丨丨to put it more bluntly, does not violate the master's will丨丨and is beaten. But our views seem to be different. We feel that no one should have the right to exploit the labor of others. Hiring a maid should be punished by law.</p>
<p>There are also noteworthy points in the conversation between the judge and Lianxi. The judge asked: 'What does Chen Xu do every day?' Lianxi supplied: 'She doesn't get up until twelve o'clock. After washing her face, she still lies down and sleeps...' Asked: 'What do you do every day?' Answered: 'I get up at seven o'clock every morning to sweep the floor, wipe the table, and light the stove. After Chen Xu finishes eating and goes to sleep, I eat. I eat her leftovers.' Asked: 'What does Chen Ruizhang (i.e., Chen Xiangjun) do?' Provided: 'He learns to act in dramas.' Asked: 'What does Chen Xu do?' Provided: 'She calls for Chen Ruizhang to learn to act in dramas.' We all see it, the life of the oppressor is so corrupt and enjoyable丨丨while the oppressed is so laborious and miserable! Therefore, the oppressors are really the ones who should be oppressed, and the oppressed are the ones who should oppress these demons!</p>
<h3>Autobiography of a "Social Person"</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>丨Nora After Leaving Home, In a Corner of Society丨</p>
<p>The editor of Women's Garden knows that I have been in society for several years, so she gave me this topic and asked me to write about my experience. At first, I felt it was very difficult because I was not good at fiction, and if I wrote honestly, it would not be very beautiful. But after thinking carefully, these experiences are all social phenomena. Making these phenomena public as objects for studying women's issues is the duty of every woman.</p>
<p>When I was still in school, I was in heaven丨丨children's heaven. I never thought about families or societies, things outside of heaven. At the same time, my mother died too early, and my family did not give me much of an impression.</p>
<p>From the age of ten, I lived in school. School is separated from the family and not connected to society, so it becomes heaven in the clouds. I lived in heaven for twelve years. Because of economic difficulties in my family, I was forced to enter society. At this time, I was just over twenty years old, my wings were not hard, my feathers were not full, and I was timid and afraid to enter that unfamiliar society. I didn't think about going home either. I hoped that I could enter heaven again, or that someone would come to help me. Who knew that I would be tricked by society and locked in a family?</p>
<p>Since I was unwilling to be locked in a family, I was unwilling to do, unable to do, and simply didn't know how to do things related to the family, such as serving my husband, pleasing my in-laws, and supporting my children. At the same time, he was an author without a job and had not yet become famous, and our life was very difficult. In order to share the responsibility for the family's economy and reduce my husband's pain, I often thought about entering society. But no one sympathized with me or helped me.</p>
<p>Crying, resentment, and hatred could not destroy my desire for "independent life" and "free life"! The "eating someone's food and obeying someone's orders" life that had no reason to obey, I was unwilling to live any longer. During these times, I thanked a sister who liberated me. So I finally entered society.</p>
<p>At first, I taught in my hometown in Hunan. Because of the divorce, I was unduly insulted and despised by the environment丨丨society. I couldn't bear the trampling, so I fled from my hometown to Beiping.</p>
<p>In Beiping, I lived in the home of a relative, waiting for work. Probably it was always my fault that I provoked the relative's wife's unprovoked insults in just three or four days. In reality, I had never loved her husband, and she thought that I丨丨a divorced woman丨丨was born to be trampled on. Before long, I went to a newspaper in T and became a proofreader.</p>
<p>From this time on, I officially entered society. There was not a single acquaintance; all my colleagues were men, except for one woman who was very familiar with them.</p>
<p>The newspaper was a business with some official atmosphere. There were five or six proofreaders, and Mr. W and I were responsible for the two pages of important news.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was tense, or at least, it gave me a lot of new stimulation. The first thing I can't forget is this: Not long after I took office, thanks to the promotion of Mr. Y, the editor-in-chief, I was assigned to be the deputy editor of the supplement. It turned out that the formal editor had been on leave for two or three months, and Ms. X, the other female proofreader, and Mr. G, who edited foreign news, were jointly acting as editor. Mr. G was responsible for reviewing the manuscripts, and Ms. X was responsible for the rest of the affairs. Now that I was the acting editor, and the editor-in-chief had also issued a note (she was privately entrusted), Ms. X was very unhappy. She used the excuse that the editor-in-chief's handling of affairs did not follow the procedures, and that she had not been notified of the handover, so she made a big scene. Originally, in terms of qualifications, she was much older. I had only been there for less than two months; in terms of personal relations, although I was the president's nephew, she and the president were also family friends, plus direct friendship. Moreover, everyone in the newspaper, except the lower-level proofreaders and workers, had known her for a long time, and they often joked and played together. What was the reason for me to get this position in this kind of newspaper?</p>
<p>As Ms. X said: Because the editor-in-chief was biased towards me? According to Mr. Y's explanation, he often saw me writing articles in the supplement, so he recognized my writing. The president had a letter asking him to assign one of the two female employees at will, so he naturally assigned me.</p>
<p>The matter caused embarrassment to both sides, and Mr. Y didn't want to offend Ms. X, so he telegraphed the editor, Mr. C, who was on leave, asking him to come back to work as soon as possible. Mr. C came back soon, and I remained a proofreader. Ms. X and I were reconciled.</p>
<p>The evil consequences have already been sown, and the future troubles are just beginning. When I first entered society, I was naive, simple, and innocent. I didn't know that I should be respectful (formal etiquette) and communicative to my superiors. Ms. X was the opposite: her "political skills" were very high, and she used both active and passive means to deal with me; it seemed that nothing less than this could eliminate the hatred in her heart and avenge the revenge of the previous day.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, once, Mr. W proofread the editor-in-chief's editorial and dropped a paragraph, so the tone of the following text was inconsistent with the previous text. The next day, when the newspaper was printed, the editor-in-chief was furious. He immediately issued a note, deducting five yuan from the salary. He also told us that I would be responsible for proofreading the editorials from now on. Thanks again to Mr. Y's promotion, this resentment was naturally directed at me.</p>
<p>The fatal wound that society gives to women is the arrow of chastity. To suppress women's development and destroy women's rights, all you have to do is groundlessly accuse her of "bad behavior," even if she has the intelligence and talent of Wu Zetian, Empress Dowager Cixi, or Li Qingzhao, she is not worthy of respect. Just because I was more active and didn't pay attention to the inherent virtues of women such as "chaste and gentle"丨丨I liked to talk to male colleagues, or the two or three of us sat and talked quietly, or listened quietly to them discuss international politics, or even sometimes studied problems with a man in the bedroom, etc.丨丨and at the same time didn't know the new skills of "bragging," "acting coy and charming," my crime was judged by public opinion (the so-called public opinion is the public opinion of the masses in the newspaper).</p>
<p>One night, because an outside reporter asked me to record a rather interesting piece of social news for him, he described his experiences in my bedroom. The weather was hot in June, and our small proofreading room in the pigeon-cage-like Chinese-style foreign house was not well ventilated. The large editorial office had more than ten electric lights and more than a dozen people. In order to be comfortable, I often proofread in the bedroom. The bedroom was shared by Ms. X and me, but she proofread the supplement during the day and rarely slept here at night, so it was also very quiet. But although it was a bedroom, it was connected to the studio, and opposite it was the president's office, so it should have been a public place, except when we locked the door to sleep.</p>
<p>Perhaps because the story was told in an interesting place or because I couldn't write a word, we laughed. The laughter reached the ears of the president, making his thick eardrums vibrate in a new way, and his nerves felt uneasy. He immediately ordered the reporter to go to the studio and called me to his office to give me a big lecture, saying that women should be "graceful" and "chaste and gentle." This is the virtue of women.</p>
<p>I accepted the four words "graceful" to some extent. Perhaps I still couldn't get rid of some girlishness, "fidgety" and "not very graceful." I should examine myself and humbly accept the teachings of him丨丨my father's friend丨丨.</p>
<p>But I couldn't help but feel disgusted by the second lesson. Even though the grindstone of life oppressed me, I could only temporarily let me lose my job and find another job.</p>
<p>The matter was very simple: The newspaper held an editorial meeting, and he cancelled my qualification to join the meeting in the meeting place. The other male proofreaders were sitting there, and X You was on leave. What authority and reason did he rely on to insult me like this? I really wanted to ask him on the spot, but who had the courage to support me? At this time I understood. I was so angry that I didn't say a word and walked out. Afterwards, I wanted to deal with him through legal procedures, but I thought: The law cannot protect "my" personality.</p>
<p>I quietly left this newspaper like this.</p>
<p>I failed in society; I knew it wasn't because I lacked ability or courage; it was just that I lacked social awareness and didn't know how to properly place myself in every social environment.</p>
<p>After this, I still struggled in society and lived a very difficult life. What I encountered was that every environment gave me an unexpected new stimulus. I was surprised and I doubted: Did I really do something wrong?</p>
<p>Woman, oh woman! Entering society is like entering prison.</p>
<p>But I am not willing to retreat. I want to be enterprising. I hope to transform this prison into a paradise for people!</p>
<h3>Special Group of Nurses</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>Before "January 28th Incident," in a certain neighborhood near Zhabei, there lived a family considered "strange" by the neighbors. It seemed many people lived in this house, but there were neither frail old people nor infants in swaddling clothes, and not a single robust man. Those who entered and exited the house all day were women of varying ages. Although these women usually wore elaborate qipaos and leather shoes, upon closer inspection, one could see differences among them. Those who wore high heels accounted for only one or two tenths of the group. Their hair was always curled, and their faces were painted with red, white, and even black. The "reformed" group, who wore practical, half-sized, all-weather leather shoes, had faces that were yellowish-white, and their hair was either slicked back neatly or unkempt, resembling a pile of scorched yellow straw. Others had not yet rid themselves of their "three thousand worries" and still wore their hair in a bun resembling a teapot handle, hanging on the back of their necks.</p>
<p>What kind of women were these? They were professional women on the front lines of their careers! Their profession was to serve the sick for the wealthy as special nurses, or as they proudly called themselves, Special Nurses. This "strange house" was a kind of trade association-like public house formed by many of them for the convenience of their business. The origin of these special nurses, like that of general nurses, was the church schools and hospitals that came to China along with the imperialist warships. These associations were mostly formed by people who had graduated for some time and were tired of the monotonous hospital life, in order to meet the great demand for special nurses from wealthy patients in Shanghai. Because being a special nurse was not only freer in life, but also the remuneration, when work was busy, was double or three to four times the monthly salary of an ordinary nurse.</p>
<p>Speaking of remuneration, there were original regulations in their profession. They served the sick in day and night shifts, both calculated at five yuan per shift. If they understood English and served foreign patients, it was five taels of silver per shift. As for the work, it also varied in intensity depending on the patient's condition. Generally, it was just to carry out the doctor's orders, take the patient's temperature, check their breathing, count their pulse, administer medication, and occasionally take care of their diet and excretions.</p>
<p>Although these women could obtain considerable comfort and freedom in their material lives through their own labor, their success or failure on the path to marriage could not escape the established laws of society. That is, the young and beautiful ones were snatched away by wealthy patients and ambitious doctors before they could complete their four or five years of arduous apprenticeship. Those who were less attractive or more strong-willed, after a few years of apprenticeship and a few years of professional pursuit, not only had their youth abandoned by the roadside, but also their chances of marriage had long faded with the passing of time.</p>
<p>In fact, it was not impossible for them, aged twenty-seven or eight, or thirty to forty, to get married, but as the saying goes, "too high to reach, too low to accept." The rich and powerful, or modern young men, did not disdain them for being too old, but despised their humble profession and would not favor them. As for those who were about the same age as them and relied on their own labor to earn a living, they were unwilling to stoop so low. In fact, having grown up in such a hypocritical and vain environment, and often entering and leaving the luxurious mansions of the wealthy, they could not get used to the lives of couples who could obtain equal enjoyment through equal labor after marriage. In addition, their feudal consciousness was still very strong, and they still considered it shameful for a woman to marry after thirty. For these complex reasons, they had no choice but to join those who had had problems with marriage, were confined by feudal ideas within their families, and had received hypocritical and anesthetizing education. Those who had resolved not to marry then took this path to make a living, and older women (who accounted for half of their number) spent their entire lives enduring the embarrassing life of washing heads, rubbing feet, wiping feces, and pouring urine for wealthy patients, or even entertaining those wealthy and idle fake patients. Moreover, unfortunately, they had to inevitably witness and send off the coming and going of the grim reaper covered with a black veil. When serving patients with infectious diseases, they were even more at risk of their lives.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these women were not only not enthusiastic about seeking progress in thought and learning, and improving their own status, but also did not understand it. Although this was due to their strong complacency, the biggest reason had to be attributed to the special education they received. Under the slogans of "serving God" and "helping neighbors," hypocritical religious figures exploited them like docile sheep without pay for four or five years. And what knowledge and skills did they give them? Apart from making beds, taking temperatures, dispensing medicine, and taking bedpans for patients, they would not offer much else. However, on invisible gifts, they were very generous in promising them heaven. Therefore, they believed in their consciousness that since they could now support themselves, not only was the problem of this life solved, but there was still happiness waiting for them in the next life. So they became a kind of life that was harmless to others and uncontroversial to the world, and this kind of life often easily flowed into a type of absolute selfishness.</p>
<p>Removing everything on the surface, and adding religious hypocrisy and chains to their inner "sexual" lives, it is undeniable that they were subjected to greater suppression. Therefore, homosexual love was quite common among them, and nine out of ten had a very close female friend. Although they were all nominally friends on the outside, the situation of sharing the same pillow and quilt, being considerate and intimate, and relying on each other far exceeded that of ordinary friends.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the service of these special nurses is limited to wealthy patients, there is no question that it can become a suitable profession for women. Therefore, I hope that the sisters engaged in this industry will make special efforts to improve the health of their own spirit and body in addition to its economic implications; I also hope that those who are enthusiastic about the women's movement can make efforts to supervise and guide this women's profession.</p>

<h3>European Women in the First World War</h3>
<p>— Huang Nianzhong</p>
<p>Everyone is preparing for the Second World Massacre, and it is not without meaning to talk about European women in the last madness now that women are about to prepare to say goodbye to their lovers and sons going to war with tears.</p>
<p>After 1914, in every country in Europe, tens of millions of workers, peasants, and students were dragged into the trenches by the slogan of "patriotism", so there were tens of millions of families, tens of millions of women and mothers who were anxious and sad day and night. In the entire four years, the tears that most of them shed for the anxiety of life and the grief for the dead will definitely not be less than the bullets consumed in that era!</p>
<p>But there was also a kind of person who felt some anxiety, that is, many great entrepreneurs felt the lack of labor. Men with labor abilities had all gone to the front lines, and the remaining women became the target of their solution to this anxiety.</p>
<p>In Paris, London, and many large industrial cities, almost all the drivers and ticket sellers of all public vehicles, the service personnel in all industrial fields, and the clerks of all stores were women. Street vendors and porters sometimes also used women. Large cities almost became a world of daughters.</p>
<p>They were very bitter, especially the wives of soldiers. Often, drunken women could be found on the streets, all of whom were strong women who missed the conscripts. Although according to the bourgeoisie, they were abusing freedom after leaving men, had no sense of responsibility, and were willing to fall because they could get conscript family allowances, this argument was obviously wrong. Most of them were willing to indulge in oblivion because of loneliness and because of life.</p>
<p>The plight of women in the lower classes was even greater. Their husbands went to war, and the family expenses and the education of their children had to be borne by themselves. Although there was also some separation pension, it was of no help at all. They had to throw their children into boarding schools in slums, letting them be half-fed and half-starved, while they took over the manufacturing of weapons that would kill their husbands and sons at wages lower than those of men, or manufactured a large number of war-speculation commodities for industrial leaders. At that time, the British government and commercial organizations had a lot of competition in order to win this cheap female labor. Both sides wanted to obtain special wartime convenience or special profits from these helpless working women.</p>
<p>However, in this extraordinary period, working women also gained many valuable experiences. They tested their own abilities, shattered the social prejudice against women's contempt, and exerted the same abilities and knowledge as men in all industrial sectors. In the dangerous munitions factories at that time, the difficult machinery workshops, and all the affairs of complex machinery, it proved that women's inventive talents, adaptation, and enthusiasm surpassed men. No one dared to give a low evaluation of women's social and economic value.</p>
<p>At first, women were not allowed to participate in medical work in England. Many enthusiastic women voluntarily established war hospitals in France and achieved remarkable results. Their excellent results were passed back to their own country, so the officials of their own country immediately employed women in medical affairs. Later, in the garrison hospitals in various parts of London, except for the gatekeepers, from the honorary major doctors to the non-commissioned officer managers were all educated women. In France, helping the victims of Pelgium and northern France, helping the homeless in Alsace and Lorraine, so that tens of thousands of families did not lack clothing, and tens of thousands of children were able to go to school safely, these are all the achievements of French educated women.</p>
<p>In the Great War, working women and educated women tasted a lot of hardship. On the other hand, they also fully exerted their creativity and organizational power. Their 丨丨 especially the success of this kind of test of their own strength by working women, accompanied by the suffering of reality, further promoted their broad unity. The organization of the "National Women's Labor Union" in the United Kingdom, which proposed future occupational insurance and the demand for equal wages for men and women, is a concrete example of this unity.</p>
<p>Perhaps everyone will ask, in this unprecedented turmoil, what do the leisurely bourgeois ladies do?</p>
<p>The cannons could not penetrate their deep boudoirs, and the rough black bread would never reach their lips. Their lives were as comfortable and easy as ever. Occasionally, on the streets of London, you could see some upper-class women wearing khaki volunteer uniforms doing so-called "defense" work. In the safe areas of the battlefield, you may encounter one or two visiting "charitable" noblewomen, but all this is the romantic of their private lives, to borrow Gorky's words, "for the sake of monotony", and has nothing to do with the public.</p>
<p>Secondly, let me mention the gender relations during the European War. From Remarque's books, we can see some sexual chaos of upper-level sergeants, and from Barbusse's books, we can see some failed sexual pursuits of lower-level soldiers. The masterminds of the war isolated tens of thousands of young and strong men and women, but it is generally impossible to make them maintain the mood of a monastery through the abandonment of humanity. Therefore, on the front line, soldiers have three w (Women, Wine, War). For soldiers, the first W also added many secret events of exchanging soldiers' bread. In the rear, romantic stories became the most common phenomenon. All this further reveals the hypocrisy of the so-called monogamy, and at the same time, the treatment of illegitimate children has become the most thorny issue for the party leaders of the warring countries today.</p>
<p>The clouds of war are spreading again today. Women, remember the lessons learned by European women in the First World War!</p>
<h3>People Living Under Two Kinds of Hunger</h3>
<p>— Benzi</p>
<p>On a Sunday afternoon, I walked past the Great World. Under the wall on its side, there stood a large crowd of people. Out of curiosity, I squeezed in too. It turned out that they were looking at the notice of the Second Special District Court. Its general meaning was: "Rape of a woman under the age of fifteen will be sentenced to seven years of imprisonment; gang rape by two or more people will be sentenced to life imprisonment...to maintain humanity and social morality." After reading it, I immediately thought of the social news of Shen Bao on December 11th: "A fifteen-year-old girl was gang raped by nine young men all night." This notice may be to repeatedly publicize the so-called legal provisions to warn the citizens because of this matter.</p>
<p>This is such a fortunate and pitiful thing! We live in this uneven society, and we are heavily pressed by the boulders of double hunger, so that we cannot even breathe a sigh of relief! This piece of social news clearly explains that, in order to eat, a girl who does not understand the world and whose development is not yet mature is driven by hunger and cold to engage in the prostitution career of a goddess. A group of young people who wanted to vent their wolf-like carnal desires gang raped this underage girl. This is the expression of the impulse of sexual hunger!</p>
<p>In this world economic panic, the storm is impacting every corner of the world. After the turbulent waves of this black tide of panic, the rural areas of our country are extremely poor and bankrupt. The domestic feudal landlords, the bourgeois usurers, and the harsh taxes also explain the good data on the fall of the rural areas! Groups of rural women, in order to escape famine, all ran to the city. They thought that the city was the food place for them to escape hunger, but when they gathered at the crossroads of this city that seemed to have abundant food, their illusions, like the beautiful soap bubbles played by children, soon shattered丨In this way, they began to wander and wander. For two meals of unsatisfied food, they, like the unemployed female laborers in the city, automatically or were seduced into becoming professionals who sold their flesh in nightlife. The deepening of the economic bankruptcy of the rural areas and the increase in the unemployment of female laborers in the cities, the number of prostitutes who sell themselves has increased at a positive proportional high speed!</p>
<p>Everything in the current society is commodified, and the instinctual demands of sexual life have also developed abnormally. On the one hand, there is a relative surplus of women, and on the other hand, a large number of men are living as bachelors. The former is the cause of the latter, and the reason for this strange phenomenon is very simple: in years of widespread depression, the number of unemployed men is increasing day by day, and those with jobs are also living in distress or half-starvation. Where is the extra money to marry a wife? Moreover, the fear of bearing the burden of life after marriage will also make men afraid of marriage. Then, in order to satisfy the demands of their sexual instincts, the only way is to prostitute themselves!</p>

<h3>Financial Rumors Spread, Loan Establishment, Gold Price Plunges Severely</h3>
<p>Dropping to Sixteen Dollars and Twenty Cents Per Tael</p>
<p>Winter Solstice Holiday on the 25th and 26th</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw drastic declines due to worries over the China Merchants Bank's foreign exchange blockage, loosening domestic market conditions, another reduction of 7.5% in the silver equalization tax, and widespread apprehension. Major players heavily sold off, and rumors of adverse conditions spread quickly. Trading floors experienced intense selling pressure, leading to severe price drops. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw significant declines in British and American markets, and forward silver prices also contracted. Exchange rates were stable, and London spot gold rose by 2.5 pence. Unofficial pre-market trading opened higher, rising to 0.12 yuan, attributed to the excessive strength of the foreign silver market decline. However, sentiment weakened after reports quoted Director Wang's firm denial of centralized silver holdings, causing a retreat to 98 yuan. The Central Bank's posted rates revealed declines of 1.25 for British currency and 0.25 for American currency. Customs Gold Units surged by 1.8%, leading the benchmark gold price to rise to 1014.7 yuan. Prices briefly recovered to above 1000 yuan, but the morning opened within the 1000 yuan threshold. Although the market initially stabilized after opening, the Bank of China's injection of shillings hardened the exchange market, making it difficult to maintain above 1000 yuan, resulting in a downstream trend. Some support was present, and the mistaken rumor of HSBC's rate decline and the forceful buying by Tung Feng Heng slowed the decline. Subsequently, the silver equalization tax announcement, reducing it by 7.5% to a levy of 5.75% based on a British exchange rate of 1 shilling 5 and 21875/100000 pence, triggered a sell-off. However, the market initially fluctuated. Later, the China Merchants Bank injected foreign exchange again, and domestic market conditions tightened. General speculation arose that this signaled the establishment of a loan. The mentality of many wavered, and Yu Qing Yong, acting on behalf of the Guangdong merchants, aggressively sold off, breaking the 90 yuan threshold. However, major players took advantage of the low prices to provide support, leading to some recovery at this point. Soon after, Guangdong merchants aggressively sold again, creating widespread apprehension, and prices retreated into the 90 yuan range. Rumors circulated, suggesting that if the Central Bank's loan succeeded, the non-convertible equalization bonds would not necessarily be implemented, leading to much speculation. A new wave of selling pressure arose, leading to a gradual decline. Later, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Xing Yong, and Fu Xing Yong also sold on behalf of the Guangdong merchants, further intensifying the decline. The price had already fallen 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Foreign banks seized the opportunity to buy at low prices, while the exchange market remained relatively stable. After the low point, buying activity increased, leading to a slight recovery at the afternoon close. Underlying trends were still uncertain. The day's overall trend was weak, attributed to the severe decline in foreign silver, the expected reduction in the equalization tax, and the difficulty of the market catching on. As a result, sentiment turned negative, fueling the selling pressure. The Gold Exchange will be closed for the Western Winter Solstice holiday on the 25th and 26th of this month. The market conditions for the half-day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 999.7 yuan, a decrease of 2.3 yuan compared to the previous close. The market initially stabilized upon opening. Fu Xing Yong Heng Yu advanced to 1001 yuan. The Bank of China injected March shillings at 8125. Da De Cheng Qing Yu Yi Feng Yong sold down to 999 yuan. Fu Xing Fu Xing Yong delivered orders, rising to 1000 yuan. Mackie &amp; Co. injected January shillings at 125. Fu Xing Yong Fu Yu Heng Yu Chang Da Da De Cheng Yu Qing Yong and others all sold, and near-term shillings could be settled at 4375, leading to a drop to 996.5 yuan. Han Heng Bing Xing still delivered, rising to 7.5 yuan. Shortly after, February US dollars could be settled at 31 yuan. Da De Cheng Rui Kang disposed of their holdings, retreating to 6.3 yuan. Zheng Jin bought January shillings at 1875. Fu Xing Yong Fu Chang Heng Yu Heng Chang Yong Qian Chang Xiang and others came in. Rumors spread that HSBC's posted rates were declining by 1.25 for British currency and 0.25 for American currency, leading to a rise to 9.2 yuan. Shortly after, the official announcement was released, with both British and American currencies remaining flat. Disappointed buyers, including Zhao Feng Chang Da Fa Yong Yuan Mao Yong Da De Cheng Yi Feng Yong Heng Xing and others, sold off, retreating to 6.9 yuan. At this time, due to Zhao Feng Chang Heng Yu's continued purchases, prices rose to 7.7 yuan. After the silver equalization tax announcement, falling 7.5%, a sell-off began. However, due to Tung Feng Heng's forceful buying, the decline slowed. Shanghai injected April shillings at 875. Dong Ya injected March US dollars at 75. Widespread apprehension. Ding Chang Shun Mao sold orders, leading to a gradual decline. Subsequently, Tong Yi Heng Xing Da De Cheng Yu Qing Yong Da Fa Yong Fu Yu Heng Xing Yuan Ding Chang and others heavily sold off, causing the market to weaken and break the 90 yuan threshold, falling to 89.7 yuan. Ding Chang Heng Chang Yong came in, pulling up by 1 yuan. At this time, Yu Qing Yong Heng Xing heavily sold off. Qian Chang Xiang Fu Yu Ding Kang also sold, and prices fell again to 89.5 yuan. Fu Xing Yong forcefully bought at low prices, raising prices to 91.6 yuan. However, domestic market conditions tightened again. Mackie &amp; Co. injected March shillings at 4 pence. Yu Qing Yong repeatedly sold on behalf of the Guangdong merchants, coupled with Da Chang Xiang Zhao Feng Chang Da Fa Yong Qing Fa Yong Fu Chang and others successively selling off, prices fell to 87.5 yuan. Fu Xing Yong Da De Cheng took advantage of the low prices to deliver orders, rising to 8.8 yuan. However, sentiment was extremely weak. Rumors spread that the Sino-British loan had succeeded, believing that the non-convertible equalization bonds would not be implemented in the near future, leading to numerous rumors. The psychology of many supported this. The trading floor presented a situation of oversupply. Yu Qing Yong Zhao Feng Chang Ju Chang Da Fa Yong Heng Yu and others sold orders, falling to 5 yuan. Ding Chang Fu Xing Yong came in, and banks bought March shillings at 0625, recovering to 6.8 yuan. Yu Qing Yong Yuan Mao Yong Fu Yu Zheng Chang Heng Yu and others sold again. Despite some resistance, the selling pressure was overwhelming, falling to 3.5 yuan. Han Heng Yuan Kang Xiang Da De Cheng Yu Qing Yong Wan Xing Ding Chang and others bought at low prices.

<p>Golden Rooster Gradually Softens: The opening of the spot yarn auction continued the upward trend.

As a result, selling pressure suddenly increased, and the market trend reversed downwards.</p>
<p>Spot Flower Prices Rise and Then Retreat: The opening of the spot flower auction was strong, with eager buyers due to the continued rise of Indian cotton, which reached a new high. American cotton also followed suit, becoming increasingly tight. Distant months reached the highest prices. Unexpectedly, by the third closing, changes occurred suddenly. It was heard that gold prices had fallen below the 1,000 yuan mark, and the settlement prices for all months fell by 5 to 1 jiao. In the afternoon, rumors were even more rampant in the market.

Prices rose slightly, followed by selling or closing of positions. With the holidays approaching, the market eventually returned to calmness. Merchants are now awaiting an indication of next year's quotas. Most of the transactions this week were for near-term settlement. Reports of scattered trade from various parts of the country are quite good. General transactions are improving, so sentiment is good, but the interest of speculators is not yet significant. The cotton loan amount is set at 1 jiao and points, so the selling price cannot be considered low. However, when prices are high, cotton farmers may continue to sell publicly stored cotton. It is expected that the market situation will be between not being able to fall and not being able to rise. Prices will likely stabilize at current levels. Only stronger purchases by colleagues can maintain the upward trend. At the same time, the possibility of German goods being exchanged for American cotton seems unlikely, as it conflicts with the general policy of the State Department on international trade.</p>
<h3>Grain and Flour Markets Weak but with Restraining Force</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, the market situation for each month generally showed a stable and unchanged trend. Quotations for foreign wheat were around 1 jiao and 6 fen higher in Chicago, and there were differences of 4 fen in Canada. When prices opened, this month's contracts, due to the approaching settlement date, had more trading and saw some liquidation. Market sentiment had been weak. Afterwards, because both sides were very quiet, and sellers were more balanced, market sentiment turned stable again. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, this month's contracts were being absorbed step by step amid uncertainty due to active spot sales. Market sentiment was weak but stable. Distant months saw strength because factories were not selling and there was continued buying from the interior. Market sentiment was firm, but in the context of quiet trading, this kind of rise and fall was very calm. As a result, the current month was down 2 li and a half, January was up 1 fen, February was up 7 li and a half, March was up 1 fen and 2 li and a half, April was up half a fen, and May was down 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Spot Wheat Concedes as Buyers Persist</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market situation for each month generally showed a stable trend. Quotations for foreign wheat were 1 jiao and 6 fen higher in Chicago, and there were differences of 4 fen above and below in Canada. When prices opened, trading for each month remained quiet. However, as there were fewer sellers, there was a slight rebound. Therefore, each board seemed to tighten. However, trading was very quiet, and this rise and fall felt very dull. As a result, the current month was unchanged, January was up 3 fen, and March was up 1 fen. The spot wheat market had been holding steady for many days, but yesterday, due to customer concessions, asking prices fell by 3 to 4 fen. Dong Xuzhou wheat was offered at 4 yuan, second grade at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 9 fen, Liuhe Baoying wheat at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 4 fen, Yangzhou Yaowan wheat at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 3 fen, Haizhou wheat at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 6 fen, Bengbu wheat at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 7 fen, Jiangjiaba wheat at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 8 fen, and Luohe wheat at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen, totaling 12,000 bags, which were taken by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat will have a natural rebound and may continue to rise, but there is unlikely to be a high rise. The Chicago and Winnipeg grain exchanges will be open until 1 PM next Monday.</p>

<h3>River Rice Sales are Few as the Year Ends</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Over 50 sources from various gangs (totaling over 8,000 piculs)</p>
<p>As the year-end approaches, money is tight, and people are unwilling to accumulate inventory. Sales of various goods are sparse. Prices of various thick japonica rices continue to fall by 1 to 2 jiao. Only the Weihaiwei gang bought about 200 bags of late rice, with prices falling by corners to over 1 jiao. At the same time, Du Yang pointed rice also fell by corners, only because of the shortage of Yin Bian Yuan Lai rice which was relatively stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 20 sources from various river wharves. In terms of sales, various colors remained sluggish. Only high-grade Bai Yuan rice was selling slowly. Market prices for high-grade Bai Geng rice were up small corners, while medium and lower grades were up smaller corners. Other sharp and early thin rice varieties were generally weak. Bai Yuan was stable.</p>
<h3>Siam Broken Rice Falls by a Small Corner</h3>
<p>Term Foreign Rice Continues to Transact</p>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for guest rice in this street was still good, and there was also some demand from the interior. However, with money being exceptionally tight at the end of the year, entry prices were generally low. And foreign wheat inventory was abundant, and foreign merchants were constantly seeking sales every day. Market sentiment remained flat and soft. There were many firm orders for Siam broken rice, and spot inventory was also abundant. Yesterday, only 2,000 bags were bought by the interior, and the price was immediately lowered by a small corner. Other rice varieties were able to stand firm with some effort because cargo owners insisted on their prices. The opening of 1,000 bags of West Guizhou rice was not affected and rose slightly. The inventory of Ke Xian from various routes has stabilized, but the speed of sales to the interior is slower than before. Market sentiment is also flat and soft. In general, there are few days left in the year. If there are no unexpected sales outlets, the market will not rise sharply. Term foreign rice continues to be sold by Dafu, with 500 tons of West grade for April being purchased by this street. Foreign merchants are very keen to sell, and there may be a large number of agreements reached within the year.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Xin Chao Qing Falls by Five or Six Corners</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sentiment in the sugar market stabilized. The association's benchmark price for No. 24 raw sugar was 18 yuan and 6 jiao and a half for ordinary spot goods, and 18 yuan and 7 jiao and a half for goods stored in this warehouse, with no rise or fall. No. 89 Dutch red sugar was 14 yuan and 2 jiao for high-grade goods, with over 500 bags transacted. Ordinary was 14 yuan. No. 1 white from this factory remained at 18 yuan. Xin Chao Qing turned weak due to increased arrivals. Hao Fang's rejection was ineffective, and 800 bags were offered yesterday. Ti Zhuang Qing was 12 yuan and 2 jiao, second grade was 12 yuan, Huang Gang Qing was 11 yuan and 8 jiao to 7 jiao, Ban Nan Qing was 11 yuan and 6 jiao, and Longgang Qing was 21 yuan and a half, down 5 to 6 jiao from the previous board. Xin Zhi Chi continued to arrive in 700 bags, with over 600 bags offered at 14 yuan and a half. The quality of the goods was higher than before, but it was still insufficient. Over 300 boxes of Ben Pian Qing were offered at a price of 10 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, down a small corner and a half from before.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Wood Ear Weak but Recovering</h3>
<p>Rebound of Three or Four Yuan</p>
<p>Wood ear recently increased significantly because land prices in the Han market rose by 3 to 4 yuan. Although sales here have not been smooth, market prices have also risen accordingly. For example, small package ears of aviation grade were previously priced at 92 to 3 yuan, but are now priced at 97 yuan. Assorted brands range from 92 to 3 yuan to 82 to 3 yuan. Both the Fujian and Guangdong gangs continue to buy.</p>

<h3>Smiles May Not Always Be Frequent</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhi</p>
<p>Everyone says this year is the year of magazines, but I would rather say: at the same time, this year is also the "year of essays," the "year of humor." In fact, the number of publications dedicated to "humorous essays" published this year is indeed particularly large: the original "The Analects" need not be mentioned, as it is the pioneer in specializing in "humor." The subsequent "Ren Jian Shi," "Hua An," "Hua Mei," etc., are also well-known for their "humor" this year. At the same time, many large magazines also had to specially publish "humorous" essays because they saw the prevalence of the "humor" trend. As for the essays prevalent this year, in my opinion, they were also derived from this "humor" trend. Not to mention anything else, just the book title "Selection of Excellent Essays" is already "humorous" enough. Thus, under everyone saying "this year is the year of magazines," saying again that this year is the "year of humor," and therefore saying that 1934 is the "era of humor," who can say that is wrong?</p>
<p>The word "humor" is originally a transliteration of the word "Humour." Because this year, the trend of "humor" is prevalent in our country, people can see or hear people talking about "humor" in magazines, in general newspaper butt, at banquets, and even on the streets. Therefore, what is the meaning of these two words "humor"? What should the English word Humour be translated into Chinese? This has become a problem. Some people say that the word Humour should still be translated as "humor," while others say it should be translated as "humiao." Someone even advocated translating it as "yumo," and the magazine "Huamei" even used the discussion of this issue as its inaugural message, saying that it was to avoid the problem of "phonetic loan," and advocated using "yumiao." From this, it can be imagined how much people are paying attention to "humor."</p>
<p>However, where does the strength of "humorous" articles lie? Professor Liang Shiqiu said: We don't look at advertisements, we look at the quality of the goods. Now, let's just randomly list some "humorous" essays to take a look丨丨</p>
<p>(1) "When I was a child, I studied in a church school, where foreigners directly taught English from the first grade of elementary school. Therefore, sometimes elementary school students cannot directly express their meaning in English. Once, in a foreign lady's English class, an elementary school student urgently needed to urinate and wanted to go to the toilet, so he pointed to his crotch and said to the foreign lady: Waterwillconeouthere (Water is going to come out from here)."</p>
<p>(2) "A young man and woman said to a modern girl: "I love you very much!"</p>
<p>That modern girl replied, "I know, I love you very much too!"</p>
<p>"Then, don't you love others?"</p>
<p>"What if I love others?"</p>
<p>"Then I must shoot the person you love to death with a pistol!"</p>
<p>"Then you better prepare two machine guns!"'"</p>
<p>(3) "The writer Bai Wei quarreled with Yang Sao, so angry that she said bitterly:</p>
<p>"I must kill you!"</p>
<p>"It's good if you can kill me." Yang Sao walked up to Bai Wei with a stubborn head and said this.</p>
<p>"Am I still keeping you?" So Bai Wei took a pair of scissors and cut off a few strands of Yang Sao's hair."</p>
<p>We have only looked at these few "goods" and already feel they are "humorous" enough, but besides making people happy and laugh, what other meaning do these things have? Even if there are also satirical texts in them, but because they have no theory as a backing, we still can't get anything besides feeling happy after reading them. The impression it gives us is still very vague.</p>
<p>I believe that the general readers of China have already learned a valuable lesson in several major movements: they know the importance of theory (as for what kind of theory is needed, that is of course another question); moreover, with the development of the Chinese cultural movement, the general readers' level of knowledge is higher, so what they require is not just more profound and systematic theories. After this year's "humor" trend, after trying out general essays, their demand for systematic and profound theories is even more urgent. I can say that the general readers now buy a book or a magazine not just casually for entertainment, their purpose must be to explore profound theories; they read an article because they want to gain profound knowledge about a certain issue, not just casually flipping through it. Therefore, I believe that the "humorous" essays and even general essays that are prevalent this year will no longer be able to maintain their superior position. If you don't believe it, then look at the Chinese publishing industry in 1935, and see whether publications dedicated to "humorous essays" are most popular with general readers, or whether "Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Hall Quarterly," "Newcomer," "World Knowledge," "The Great Wall," "Women's Voice"... are most popular with readers?</p>

<p>Without a real society, there would naturally be no literary works: literary works are a form of life depicted by writers, arising from the real society. However, a writer's depiction of reality is not like a photographer's photography, simply and rigidly copying things as they are; their depiction of reality must pass through their complex minds and be finely and artistically depicted. In this process, "imagination" is essential. In fact, the works of general romanticists naturally carry strong colors of imagination; even the works of naturalists who use positivism as their method of creation, in a sense, are depicted through their imagination. Everyone knows that Flaubert was a naturalist writer, but even in his creative process, he had to find a unique noun to represent a thing in his mind, and a unique adjective to describe the characteristics of that thing; if he did not quietly ponder and imagine, how could he achieve his wish? Zola was even a naturalist who had reached the pinnacle. His attitude towards creation was almost like that of a scientist. He first had to collect materials, personally go to live among the characters he wanted to describe, to interview those women who are related to his creation, then to realistically depict the things he wanted to depict: this seems to have no element of imagination, but can you say that his "Rougon-Macquart" series, such a massive novel, its story structure, the expression of its various characters, the arrangement of its various scenes, the organization of its words and sentences, did not pass through his imagination? Of course, one cannot say that 丨丨丨From this, it can be seen that the element of imagination in literary works is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>However, the so-called "imagination" is not an empty fabrication by the writer, but is carried out under his life experience. No matter how good a writer is at "imagining," he cannot imagine thoughts and situations that absolutely do not exist in the world, nor can he imagine things that have nothing to do with his social life. The author of "Journey to the West" said that Sun Wukong could somersault one hundred and eight thousand miles, which is of course a fantastic "imagination," but if there was no such thing as "somersaulting" in the world, and there were no numbers like "one hundred and eight thousand miles," could he still "imagine" like this? To go deeper, if Chinese society did not have strange monster ideas, and there were no people whose real lives were empty and wanted to find a world of fantasy, could the author of "Journey to the West" rely solely on his imagination to create such a mythical novel?</p>
<p>Throughout history, many literary theorists have made the "element of imagination" in literature very mysterious, believing that literary works are entirely produced by the writer's imagination. The British Coleridge even wrote a large "Theory of Imagination," arguing that the reason why literary works can move people lies entirely in their imaginative elements; even the more progressive literary theorist Ruskin said that poetry is "the noble basis for implying noble emotions with the power of imagination." In this way, it is no wonder that our literary theorists "value imagination" and separate it from life experience!</p>
<p>If we want to talk about "valuing imagination" and mystifying it, then we have to introduce the aesthetes. Oscar Wilde, in his "The Decay of Lying," besides saying that "lying" is "beautiful and not practical stories," even fiercely attacked the naturalist Zola, saying: "From an artistic point of view, Zola's works are almost without value, only zero points... Our requirements for art are rarity, charm, and imagination, simply put, just beauty. The so-called truly existing person is the meaning of a person who has never existed in this real world. Therefore, when writers borrow characters from the real world, they should at least not use sketches of real-world characters, but should transform these characters. But Zola's characters are all sketches. His works have no value precisely because of this reason." This is truly extremely mysterious! In fact, Wilde and his aestheticism are also a product of British social life at the end of the nineteenth century. If there were no decadent lives of enjoyment for British citizens and many parasitic classes in the nineteenth century, there would be no many "fabricated" literary works and aestheticism of Wilde. Wilde's life of enjoyment, aesthetic art, and all his mysterious imaginations were possessed by the new citizens and many parasitic classes of Britain at that time. Wilde was just reflecting them in literature and even in his personal life丨</p>
<p>In short, writers need and must imagine when creating, but this is not an empty fantasy separated from their social life, but is carried out on the basis of their life experience and knowledge; even those writers who indulge in fantasy, their works are a reflection of their social life, and are by no means products of empty imagination. As for some writers who do not describe real things, but go to pursue an empty ideal world beyond reality, the reason is that his social life stipulates that he cannot or dare not face reality, so that he has to resort to pure imagination when creating; at the same time, there are also some writers who try hard to describe reality, but the result is either distorting reality or failing to fully express reality, becoming an empty thing, the reason for this is also that under the regulation of their social life, they cannot correctly understand reality and fully express reality. Therefore, a writer must bravely approach real life, must correctly understand reality, must have rich experience and knowledge of social life, and of course must also have artistic expression talent, then his imagination, his subjective consciousness, and his descriptive laws can conform to the state and requirements of objective things, and thus can create great works. Everyone knows that Turgenev once portrayed a nihilist Bazarov, "and Artsibashev also gave himself the same sociological and aesthetic task as Turgenev," portraying a Sanin, but fair critics all said that Bazarov was a real character, and Sanin was a "constructed" character, so Artsibashev's description was a failure, so what is the reason for this? I think this can only be explained in their social life (including artistic talent and their ability to recognize reality): the former can correctly recognize reality and express the spirit of the times, while the latter cannot.</p>

<h3>Effective Learning Laws Based on Psychological Insights</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>I have never seen a person with mediocre knowledge create an extraordinary career. So, where does knowledge come from? I think that besides "learning," there is probably no other better way.</p>
<p>In today's world, everything must be "scientific," economical and effective, in order to defeat others. The attitude towards learning is the same. We must never again be like the ancient scholars who "buried themselves for ten years" in order to seek "divine enlightenment," because that kind of learning attitude is okay for the leisure class to spend their leisure time, but in today's people who generally pay attention to time economy, it is impossible to take such a circuitous path.</p>
<p>Five years ago, my teacher Dr. Huang Jingsi once orally translated Whipple's "How to Study" thirty-eight articles on the podium. The meaning is profound and is an effective learning law with psychological insights. I think that for a person who is struggling with how to learn, this can very well be his motto. These thirty effective learning laws are: 1. Maintain physical health. 2. Pay attention to and remedy physical defects. 3. Create an "environment" suitable for learning. 4. Develop the habit of learning in one place. 5. Learning must have a certain time. 6. The next lesson should have a considerable preparation after this lesson. 7. Start working. 9. Concentrate! 10. Do not overwork or worry. 11. Work with the purpose of learning and remembering. 12. Learning must have "motivation." 13. Remove the idea of learning for the teacher. 14. Never be easy to ask people unless it is absolutely necessary. 15. The "purpose" must be fully understood. 16. To get new knowledge, you must review old knowledge. 17. When previewing, first glimpse its outline. 18. If you encounter multiple types of work with different degrees of difficulty, you can do the difficult or easy ones first according to your past experience or ideals. 19. The learned movements must be suitable for future applications (such as the order of strokes, muscle movements during practice, which are very easy to form habits). 20. Learn important work for permanent use. 21. Pay attention to and remedy your shortcomings. 22. The daily lessons must be selected for their importance for judgment or criticism. 23. Secondary lessons or knowledge do not need to spend too much time to memorize them. 24. Learning time should not be too short or too long. 25. Lessons that need to be practiced should be practiced in stages. Concentrated practice is not very efficient. 26. Work must be stopped at a considerable time and a sign must be left. 17. After hard work, there must be a considerable rest time. 28. Use various methods to concentrate your thoughts. 29. Develop the habit of giving examples for "principles." 30. Develop the habit of psychological review. 31. If necessary, you can add comments to the book. 32. If the learning materials are many and difficult, you can make an "outline" for easy memorization. 33. Apply the knowledge you have gained when working. 34. You must memorize the definitions, formulas, dates, and outlines of professional terms (once you have to memorize them strongly, and you must understand them). 35. When the memorized materials are difficult to remember, you have to think of various mechanical methods to memorize them. 36. When reading poetry and speeches, do not divide them into paragraphs. 37. Reading aloud and reciting quickly are easy to remember. 38. Do not take too many notes in class, but you must develop the habit of organizing notes.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>— Yin Qu</p>
<p>The importance of elementary school education in the entire process of education is known and can be expressed by almost everyone. However, the lives of the elementary school teachers who implement this education are like pitiful withered grass, growing in the damp corners of the wall, without sunlight, without rain, and it seems that heaven and earth let it grow naturally and let it perish naturally, without attracting anyone's attention.</p>
<p>Although, in the entire elementary school education circle, there are also a few who receive higher treatment, but after all, among millions of elementary school teachers, they only account for the smallest number of the smallest number. At the same time, even in Shanghai, except for municipal, Public Works Bureau-established, and a few private schools, the lives of most elementary school teachers are not more reasonable than those of elementary school teachers in poor rural areas.</p>
<p>The lives of most elementary school teachers are below the horizontal line丨</p>
<p>For example, taking a city only thirty kilometers away from Shanghai as an example, the elementary school education there has made considerable progress in both form and spirit in recent years, and is praised by many educators who have visited there. However, the salaries of the teachers are still so low! The standard of treatment is based on the standard of each person's academic qualifications: such as twenty-six yuan for graduates of high school normal schools, twenty-four yuan for high school graduates, and twenty-two yuan for graduates of rural teachers' schools. Although this standard of treatment is slightly more than the number of only eight yuan in a certain county in Jiangbei, if the six yuan for food is deducted, only a dozen yuan are left. And it is very obvious that this standard of treatment does not take the true teaching efficiency as the basis, but only pays attention to the titles in vain (for example, rural teachers with four-year professional training receive less treatment than old-system high school graduates without professional training). As a result, those teachers who are truly dedicated to education are forced to swallow their anger and are filled with resentment.</p>
<p>Moreover, a certain city is close to Shanghai. In the adjacent areas, often a town has a municipal elementary school and a county elementary school. Only a few steps apart, their treatments are completely different (note: the lowest treatment for elementary schools in Shanghai rural areas is thirty-five yuan, and more to one hundred yuan). This spiritually puts most elementary school teachers in a decadent and unmotivated situation, but in the final analysis, this is because China's education does not have a complete plan, so how can we bear to blame elementary school teachers deeply?</p>
<p>I once heard an elementary school teacher sigh and say: "Our generation, relying on the remaining legacy of our fathers and brothers, can still receive secondary education; but what about our next generation? What will we fathers take to educate and cultivate them?" This kind of feeling about one's own life is probably spreading in the elementary school education circle.</p>
<p>In addition to salary, there is no talk of "security." The term of employment for teachers is still half a year, so most people have the mentality of "five days in the capital." At the end of a semester, the turnover of teachers is as frequent as on the political stage, which is a considerable waste of teaching and training. Other things, such as preferential treatment for female teachers during childbirth and the regulations for pension funds, are also out of the question.</p>
<p>Under such treatment, their work cannot be made any easier. Every day from morning to dusk, in addition to the one thousand and several hundred minutes of class work per week, they also have to spend more time managing children, correcting test papers, and filling out tables and books in school administrative affairs. When children's homework or sports competitions are held, the teachers even hate not being able to work day and night to guide the work, because although the competition is for children, the test results belong to the teachers' reputation and future. Other things, such as exhibitions, etc., are nominally for students, but in fact, they are nothing more than adding many unexpected tasks to the teachers in addition to the hard routine work. In short, their lives are busy, busy, and the third one is still busy! If we add the aforementioned poverty, then the lives of elementary school teachers are intertwined with poverty and busyness.</p>
<p>The so-called education experts who live in foreign-style houses say repeatedly; "Elementary school education is a noble career, elementary school education is a noble career丨" However, the injection of this anesthetic has absolutely no effect. The "Jiaxing woman Zhang Yuzhen, who once served as an elementary school teacher and acting principal, was induced to Shanghai by her fellow villager and girlfriend Zhuang Suzhen, who worked as a female receptionist at Wing On Company in Shanghai, because her salary was meager, resulting in a tragic violation" reported by various newspapers on December 15 last year reflects the general elementary school teachers currently in office cannot be content with their noble career status, and are eagerly seeking a solution to their livelihood.</p>
<p>The tide of the times is moving forward non-stop. Those who serve as elementary school teachers, because their work is too busy and the material environment of economic conditions is bound, they have very few opportunities for further study. After leaving school for only a few years, they have already been far away from the air of new ideas and are slowly declining, declining!</p>
<p>"Elementary school teachers are selling their youth," elementary school teachers often painfully gnaw at this sentence.</p>
<p>A few miles away from my hometown, there is an elementary school. The former principal is now serving as the school's janitor. Although he could not grasp the times and follow the trend, resulting in his own doom, it is also a major tragedy in the world.</p>
<p>All of this is developed abnormally under the economic conditions. The more we say that elementary school education is important, the more urgently the treatment of elementary school teachers needs to be improved, but I wonder if our education experts have ever paid attention to this in their dreams!</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Western Front Black Mermaid</h3>
<p>— Yang Xiaocheng</p>
<p>Report from Genoa, Italy</p>
<p>Speaking of the words "Western Front," everyone will immediately think of the world-famous novel "All Quiet on the Western Front" and its movie, right? Although I use these two words as the title with the suspicion of being the same, I use our hometown Shanghai as the center of departure, so that distinguishing eastward to Japan or the United States as the eastward route, and westward to Europe as the westward route is the title. I have now completed the voyage to Western Europe and arrived in Italy.</p>
<p>It is really impossible for a traveler lying in a ship to describe the political and economic conditions of the countries or commercial ports he has passed through, because a superficial browsing cannot fully understand the depths of their social conditions. The only thing that can provide me with communication materials is the "Black Mermaid" that I saw with my own eyes during the journey.</p>
<p>The term "mermaid" is very loud in China, but I am now going to report to everyone that there are still many "Black Mermaids" in the world. Although they are black and not beautiful, they do not attract the attention of various people, so I have never seen any nautical tourists mention them, but when it comes to their art, it is also the art of swimming, which can not only be as beautiful as "mermaids," able to compare with fish, and can be called "mermaids," but also in some points, the art of "Black Mermaids" may even be higher than "mermaids." These "Black Mermaids" live in the seawater of the wharves of major commercial ports along the tropical line. Although not all of them are black people, they are generally black and shiny because they bathe in sunlight and seawater all year round. It can really be collectively referred to as "Black Mermaid." This kind of person already exists in Singapore, but the most outstanding ones are produced in "Qibu," a French colony on the east coast of Africa. They float naked in the sea and swim very fast and naturally. Their most special art is that they can sit steadily in the water without moving their hands and feet, sitting cross-legged as if sitting upright on land, but they can not sink. Ordinary swimmers have to rely on hand and foot movements to float, but they can sit and float in the water without making any gestures. "Qibu" is a port with huge winds and waves, but those "Black Mermaids" are not afraid of the winds and waves at all. When a big wave comes, they can rise and fall with the wave; even with the wave rolling, they can sit steadily on the peak of the wave. I am afraid that our "mermaid" cannot catch up with this kind of art. But all the "Black Mermaids" are not only not world-famous swimming stars, but are beggars who are played with. Whenever a ship arrives, they all gather around the ship to ask for money. Passengers on the ship throw silver coins into the water, and they can dive into the water and pick them up with their hands; some can even pick them up with their mouths. Sometimes they come on board and throw themselves into the water from a very high place to catch the silver coins thrown by the passengers. The passengers then use this to tease them and amuse themselves丨Swimming is originally an art, a sport, but now many people regard swimming as a profession. "Black Mermaids" are also good at this art, but this art has only become a means for them to beg for food in their hands. The same art also has distinctions of nobility and inferiority with the profession and identity!</p>
<h3>Sculptor</h3>
<p>— Feng Chi</p>
<p>There are many paths arranged for sculptors. In today's world where this kind of specialized talent does not seem to be too surplus, they should have relatively good prospects, right? A gilded sculptor can return to China and be a professor at a fine arts college. Taking three or four yuan an hour is not a rare thing; as for sculpting plaster statues or arranging showcases for people, it is even more inferior work. It would be a pleasing thing if they could associate with great people and celebrities and thus receive one or two copper statue business to do. The reward for a famous sculptor to cast a copper statue for someone will never be meager, with a minimum profit of five or six thousand yuan. Setting a price of around ten thousand or fifteen thousand yuan is not something unheard of. Naturally, a copper statue takes them more than half a year, but in general, their monthly income is still very considerable.</p>
<p>Regarding this kind of sculptor, I don't want to write too much about them. Below, I just want to briefly mention the lives of some students who come out of the sculpture department of fine arts colleges. These students do not have many good places to go. As a freelancer, they can naturally receive some sporadic small businesses to do. As for wanting to get a fixed position or seeking to obtain a big business, it is inevitable that it is a difficult-to-realize wish. Even if they really get something in this regard, the so-called position they get is nothing more than something to barely make a living. The so-called big business can be obtained by famous sculptors for ten thousand or eight thousand, but in their case, it is inevitable to be discounted again and again, reduced again and again, and ultimately they may not get half the amount of a famous sculptor. People even have to doubt whether his ability is enough, and even cancel the contract. It is worthy of people's sympathy that they suffer such discrimination with equal ability.</p>
<p>They can naturally also go to secondary schools to teach a few hours, and get a reward of five corners, eight corners, or one yuan per hour depending on the size of the school. They mostly understand a little painting, so in addition to teaching manual plaster practice, they can also teach painting. They can also arrange three-dimensional showcases in companies and shops, and get a fee of one or twenty yuan or two or thirty yuan per piece. They can also carve plaster statues for people, and the reward is difficult to determine, depending on the relationship between each other and the time required. There are also plaster statues of various styles carved for sale. To carve a plaster statue, you must first use a special kind of mud (said to be produced in Wuxi, and sold in stationery stores or craft shops near Shanghai Fine Arts School) to make a model, and a hollow mold is made from the model, from which many plaster statues can be cast. The procedure in between is naturally not very simple. Just in terms of utensils, there are many different sizes of bone, iron, and steel drills, chisels, knives, ...... and so on. The price of each plaster statue ranges from one or two yuan to two or twenty yuan.</p>
<p>Their better place to go is to go to a film company. They have many things to do in the film company, although the work may not all be in line with their profession. The most needed thing for film companies is to make "models." Sometimes these models are indispensable to film companies, but sometimes they are a way to cut corners. We know that the size of the image taken on the film is determined by the distance between the real object and the camera. If the camera is placed far away, large objects will become small on the film; if the camera is placed close, small objects will also appear large on the film. Based on this principle, film companies mostly do not completely build those sets that are difficult to build, have huge projects, and require a lot of expenses, but partially use some small models to replace them. These models, such as ships, trains, pagodas, palaces, city towers, fortresses, etc., are used in the same way as real ones because the proportions of the structure are uniform, and they can completely deceive the audience. If a ship catches fire or a giant building burns down, it is only necessary to burn some worthless model ships and model giant buildings. Isn't it more convenient and cost-effective?</p>
<p>There is also a kind of model, such as ancient heroes riding horses, which is sometimes needed, but if real people and horses in ancient costumes are actually dressed up and filmed, it is not only more costly and troublesome, but sometimes the result is not as pleasing as using models. However, doing this kind of thing in a film company is not necessarily a long-term nature. After a model is made, the company gets a reward of two or thirty yuan or three or forty yuan, and then they have to run for their future again.</p>
<p>However, in the film company, they can also do other things. For example, building three-dimensional sets or making subtitles is also often needed. Therefore, a sculptor who is not very successful but has some experience can always find some sporadic work in a film company. When the work of this company is completed, there is the work of that company waiting for him. With so many experiences, if there are excellent achievements, it is not entirely impossible to be given an actual position.</p>

<h3>After Seeing the Hunan Fellow Villagers' Variety Show</h3>
<p>— Zhou Min</p>
<p>丨A Grand Gathering of Hunan Film Stars and Singing and Dancing Stars丨</p>
<p>Almost everyone felt satisfied at the variety show held by the Hunan Fellow Villagers' Association to raise funds for primary schools in Shanghai. It not only brought together talent from Hunan's film and performing arts circles but also provided our drama with a new content and form of play adapting to this great gathering of talent: "Extra."</p>
<p>It's not easy to bring a sound film set to the stage, right? In the audience's ideals, they believe that the kingdom of art is full of freedom, happiness, and joy, but this here tells the audience a true scene. They—the extras—although they are indispensable figures in film work, they are always looked down upon and always forgotten by the audience. They exchange the lowest price for the longest working hours. They are veterans of playing the real life of society. In their chats, we can hear the truth of real life in modern society. In today's society, film has become industrialized, and they are the producers of this industrial production, but they live a miserable life of insufficient food and clothing.</p>
<p>The theme of this play is to express the real life of extras. The scene to be filmed on the set is a scene of the Volunteer Army fighting against the enemy and killing thieves. The Volunteer Army did not retreat due to the wounding of national heroes, and their efforts to kill the enemy were very realistic. However, this play ultimately transitions from the fake of filming to reality due to the limitations of form, then back to filming, and then back to reality, inevitably destroying the sense of reality of the drama. The components of the play within a play inevitably occupy a bit too much.</p>
<p>The playwright's technique is quite mature. He handles a scene of more than thirty people in such a way that everyone has a role. The protagonist of the play is Extra C, and the other characters also feel important. Extra C used to fight against the enemy in the Northeast and only became an extra because of the pressure of life, and the play being filmed is precisely about fighting against the enemy, so it often aroused his emotions. All of this is written very naturally. In the process of capturing two shots, the truthful content as described above is depicted, which cannot but be said to be a good harvest on today's desolate drama scene.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of the director, Mr. Yun Wei, this complex scene has no confusion. Everyone's acting is very clear to the audience. The actors all worked hard and achieved considerable gains. Among them, Mr. Yuan Muzhi, the protagonist of "Peach and Plum Calamity" playing Extra C, was the most successful. Mr. Wan Laitian, who played the director, is originally a film director, and his performance is very suitable for the role. Mr. Xiao Ying, who played the manager, vividly portrays a typical representative of the boss. Ms. Hu Ping, who played the female star, also performed just right. Mr. Wei Heling, who played Extra A, although he has gained a lot, it is a pity that his rash actions weakened the climax. Other aspects, such as the grand and realistic scenery and the wonderful effects, also added a lot of color to the play.</p>
<p>In addition to the drama, there were also solo performances by Ms. Wang Renmei, Ms. Li Lili, Ms. Li Minghui, Ms. Hu Jia, Ms. Xu Lai, and song and dance programs by the Bright Moon Society, Plum Blossom Garden, and Xinhua Society. Unfortunately, I am too unprofessional when it comes to singing and dancing—naturally, I'm not that professional when it comes to drama either—so I can't say much. However, I always feel that the whole program is very clear, and the state of various goods being presented in a jumbled, redundant, and chaotic way is gone, which cannot but be regarded as progress in this variety show.</p>

<h3>Mulian Play</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Mulian was a great disciple of the Buddha. He had great supernatural powers. Legend has it that he once went to hell to save his mother. The Ullambana Festival (held around the Ghost Festival in the seventh month of the lunar calendar), which is popular in various places today, originated from this story and has been evolved and spread. The "Mulian Saves His Mother" and "Grease Mountain" in old dramas also perform these well-known deeds. Mulian was a person who was extremely filial. In the past Chinese feudal society, he should have been regarded as a role model by those in power, and they would inevitably encourage the common people to emulate and admire him. The "Mulian Play" that I want to talk about here naturally also has the same unsound content: however, it is more detailed and stimulating in terms of script preparation and performance form.</p>
<p>Now I want to start with the story and structure of this play. Let's first examine the stories of the two plays "Mulian Saves His Mother" and "Grease Mountain" in Peking Opera, because they are related. Mulian's father, Fu the Wealthy, was a person who always did good deeds. One day, he saw a monk in front of his door eating a radish he had begged for. Before he finished eating, he fell to the ground and died. Fu the Wealthy took out money to buy a coffin for him. Later, Madam Liu dreamed of the monk again at night, and soon gave birth to a son, who was also named "Radish." Later, Fu the Wealthy passed away, and his son "Radish" became a monk. Madam Liu was grieved that the family of a virtuous person had been ruined, so she angrily broke all precepts, beat monks and scolded Taoists, drank alcohol and ate meat, offered meat oil to the Buddhist hall, demolished the Wanyuan Bridge, and did all kinds of things contrary to goodness. The King of the Underworld was furious when he learned of this and sent ghost messengers to take Madam Liu to the underworld, where she suffered all kinds of tortures such as the Mountain of Knives, the Tree of Swords, the Oil Pot, the Blood Pool, and the Grease Mountain. It is said that after Radish became a monk, he met the Buddha. The Buddha gave him the Dharma name Mulian, who had considerable Taoist practice; because he was very filial, he went to search for his mother, and later learned that his mother was suffering in hell after death, so he went to the underworld to save his mother, and traveled all over the ten halls and passed through the eighteen hells, and finally arrived at Fengdu City, where mother and son finally reunited. The play "Mulian Saves His Mother" usually only performs the part where mother and son meet in Fengdu, and "Grease Mountain" only performs the part where Madam Liu is about to suffer on Grease Mountain; while "Mulian Play" is performed in its entirety, and the plot is more complex than the above. "Mulian Play" starts with Fu the Wealthy's poor times, and then shows his development and promotion to prime minister, and his various good deeds, and his ascension to heaven after death, etc. The description of Madam Liu's all kinds of evil deeds is even more stimulating. Her abuse of monks and Taoists, the killing of animals, and her fierce and shrewish behavior are performed very vividly and lifelike. All kinds of pains in hell, such as frying in oil, casting lids, crossing the Bridge of Helplessness, and the Mountain of Knives and the Tree of Swords, are realistically set up on the stage, which is shocking to the audience. It can be seen that the story and structure of "Mulian Play" are more detailed and tighter than those of "Mulian Saves His Mother" in Peking Opera.</p>
<p>The performance scale of "Mulian Play" is also very large. "Mulian Play" has a total of seven major books and more than thirty scenes, which takes seven days and seven nights to complete. One book is played every day and night, and the performers should be given about 100 yuan of silver for the play, and food must also be provided. It is very common to spend nearly 1,000 yuan on a complete "Mulian Play" that takes seven days and seven nights, plus other expenses.</p>
<p>We can see from the number of actors required and the acting skills that the performance scale of "Mulian Play" cannot be compared with "Mulian Saves His Mother" in Peking Opera. "Mulian Play" requires a minimum of two people per scene, and large scenes require dozens to more than a hundred people. The number of actors can be increased to more than two hundred in the final reunion scene. Perhaps it is rare to see such a huge scene in Chinese folk drama performances? In terms of acting skills, the special abilities of the actors are also amazing. The performance emphasizes expressions, joy, anger, sorrow, danger, and tension, all of which are portrayed in detail. They have to shed real tears when they are sad, and they have to act as if they are in the situation when they are suffering. These are all very common. In addition, some people have to practice (or say they are divinely assisted) a kind of martial arts, like street performers, who can fly knives at a certain distance to the surroundings of another actor's head without harming him. The old master who teaches acting also has a set of skills, that is, before the main play begins, he has to chant spells to perform a set of magic, making a bamboo pole lying on the ground stand up by itself. This phenomenon is close to magic and superstition, but we still cannot fully explain this phenomenon. There are many such miraculous things in the performance process of "Mulian Play". Now I may as well give two more examples:</p>
<p>(1) "Searching for the House"丨The purpose of performing "Mulian Play" is to thank the gods, and entertainment is just a side effect. Anyone who is sick can make a wish to sing "Mulian Play", and even if the patient dies, they still have to sing it. "Searching for the House" means that one of the actors who plays the Wen Taishi goes to the altar of the people who are thanking the gods to chant spells and drive ghosts out of the "house." On this day, the people who are thanking the gods must eat vegetarian food and must not gamble, have sex, or do anything improper, otherwise disaster will come. When the Wen Taishi performs the magic, if he cannot speak fluently, then a misfortune will surely happen to this family this year. At this time, the whole family must kneel around him to reduce the harm. The gold powder on the face of the Wen Taishi can be sold for three or four yuan after removing the makeup.</p>
<p>(2) "Paralyzed Five Changs"丨When singing "Mulian Play", there are shrines for the five Chang gods in five places under the stage. During the performance, if one of them falls down, someone will definitely become unconscious and paralyzed and unable to speak. At this time, the old master must be invited to perform magic to heal them. After the healing, a reward of ten to twenty yuan must be given to the old master as a thank-you gift.</p>
<p>Naturally, these are all ridiculous tricks that are close to mythology. I personally do not believe that such strange things really happen, but because the people are ignorant and because this kind of play is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the people who are thanking the gods are always respectful and careful in carrying out their superstitious work.</p>
<p>Because the singing of Mulian Play costs a lot, the poor people certainly cannot afford to sing it, but the poor people are more likely to get sick, and they also have to "make a wish" to sing the play, so a kind of "small play" has emerged. This is similar to a kind of puppet show, but here the puppets used are idols of the Bodhisattva instead of puppets. The performance method is that the performers of "Mulian Play" hold the Bodhisattva idols in their hands and perform, singing and acting by themselves. This method costs less, and only about 20 yuan is needed each time. This kind of "small play" can also "search for the house" and drive away ghosts.</p>
<p>Legend has it that this kind of "Mulian Play" was compiled by Liu Ji (i.e. Liu Bowen) of the Ming Dynasty, and is now popular in Xuan City, Nanling, Jing County, Taiping and other counties in Anhui. The countryside of Wuhu and various counties in Huizhou also have performances of "Mulian Play". It is said that there is also a kind of "Mulian Play" in other provinces, such as Yixing in Jiangsu and Shaoxing in Zhejiang, but I don't know if its performance style is the same as what I said above. Liu Ji was originally from Qingtian County, Zhejiang. He was hired by Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty to Jinling, and he made great contributions to assisting Emperor Taizu in achieving his imperial career. His works could have been spread to southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, and eastern Zhejiang, but now there are too many myths about Liu Bowen among the people. Whether the author of this "Mulian Play" and the statement about its origin are based on conjecture is something we should suspect and deserves further investigation.</p>
<h3>A Week's Travel Back to Hometown (4)</h3>
<p>— Su Gang</p>
<p>As he spoke, he frowned for a while, then stretched his neck and busied himself back and forth on the bamboo mat on the boat for a while.</p>
<p>After the exhaustion of more than thirty people, this huge monster finally left Nanchang; at this time, layers of clouds had surged in the sky, wrapping the setting sun like rotten cotton, and the water surface reflected a strip of crimson brilliance. Seeing the current river scene, I couldn't help but think of Wang Bo's wonderful line "Autumn waters share one color with the long sky."</p>
<p>A few days of travel fatigue were exchanged for a wonderful dream scene; when I woke up the next day at one o'clock, half of the fatigue on my body seemed to have run away.</p>
<p>When the boatman saw me get up, he busied himself scooping a basin of washing water and said, "Old man! We don't have hot water here, so please make do with it!"</p>
<p>I looked into the wooden basin and couldn't help but shake my head, forcing myself to wash my face haphazardly.</p>
<p>The boatman took the washing water away and poured it out, then brought in the food; a bowl filled with dried-up peppers, and a bowl filled with coarse rice with grains, he set them out for me one by one, then said to me with a smile, "Old man, you have your own dishes, right! We only have these dishes here, and we won't change them until we get to Shangrao!"</p>
<p>"Do you eat this every day? Can you eat it?"</p>
<p>"If we don't eat this dish, there's no other dish to eat! Old man, please eat quickly, we're going to go into the water in front." He said, grinning again.</p>
<p>"Go into the water?" I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes! Old man, haven't you ever been on this kind of boat before? No wonder, you always have to go into the water when you're on this kind of boat." He said nonchalantly as usual.</p>
<p>Before I had finished my meal, I heard the boat owner shouting to the crew on the springboard, "Eat quickly! We've reached the shoal in front; hurry up and ask the guests to get off the boat!"</p>
<p>Many boatmen shouted in unison, and suddenly became busy again; the boatman who was delivering the food came in again to urge me, "Have you finished eating, old man? We've reached the shoal in front!"</p>
<p>"What should I do? It's going to be life-threatening to go into the water in this cold weather?" I said hesitantly, with a reluctant look on my face.</p>
<p>"Old man, there's no way around it, the boat is too heavy! Look! Aren't those guests in front all going down?" He had a bitter smile on his face, but his body was also shaking like a piano.</p>
<p>Looking at his shabby expression, and looking at the several guests who were already standing in the water, my heart couldn't help but soften; I encouraged myself and took off all the clothes from my lower body, followed the boatman to the bow of the boat, and slowly slipped into the water.</p>
<p>This huge monster seemed to be tired of walking and stopped there panting. The water was so clear that even a needle could be found. The stones the size of goose eggs at the bottom of the river were printed on the surface of the water, like a crystal glass pattern.</p>

<p>Supplement to Shen Bao This City Film Special</p>
<h3>The Process of Adapting the Classic Novel "Treasure Island" by the Great British Writer Stevenson to the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>Amidst the cleanliness movement, Hollywood production companies, in order to prevent difficulties from the Film Censorship Board and religious groups, are taking the most clever approach by using historical events and literary works as subjects for films. Therefore, recently in Shanghai cinemas, we have seen several films adapted from literary works, such as "Camille," depicting the great poet Byron, "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Alexandre Dumas, and "The Storm" by Ostrovsky. Recently, Nanjing will also publicly screen Stevenson's "Treasure Island."</p>
<p>The content of "Treasure Island" is entirely centered around pirates. Initially, the story was told by the author to his two children, but after publication, it became a literary classic, still popular among readers of various countries. Now, Stevenson's "Treasure Island," depicting the lives of pirates, has been adopted by MGM as the subject matter for a screenplay and adapted into a sound film, starring Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper. Stevenson's two children, one named Lloyd Osbourne, has now become a famous writer, and the other, Isobel Osbourne, is now the wife of playwright and screenwriter Salibury Field. "Treasure Island" may have been produced by them.</p>
<p>Stevenson was a sickly writer. When he went to France for rest, he had already become a writer. Coincidentally, in France, he met Mrs. Osbourne of California, and they later married. Stevenson soon went to California and once lived in Calistoga and Monterey. In Monterey, he wrote many works. When he was in California, he told the story of "Treasure Island" to the two children of Mrs. Osbourne's previous husband. This story was published in London in 1883 and immediately became a timeless masterpiece. Now, this timeless masterpiece has been adapted to the silver screen. For the readers of this story, there are at least hundreds of millions of people who have read it and have deep impressions. Therefore, the production aspect naturally requires careful consideration. Director Victor Fleming handled everything very cautiously beforehand.</p>
<p>Screenwriter John Lee Mahin adapted "Treasure Island" into a screenplay, faithfully ensuring that the screenplay did not deviate from the original meaning, especially in the description of dialogue and actions. In "Treasure Island," the director did not focus on making the film's mood entirely based on action, but instead strived to follow Stevenson's descriptions. When "Treasure Island" was being filmed, special attention was also paid to the set design because every viewer who has read the original "Treasure Island" has a deep impression left in their mind of Stevenson's description of the "interior of the apple barrel," "the fence of the stockade," "the discovery of treasure," and "the exploration of the Hispaniola ship." Therefore, the handling of the scene must be particularly careful!</p>
<p>In the film "Treasure Island," everything regarding the scenery of pirate life and all the props, such as firearms, daggers, cannons, and other utensils, were designed by Darrel Franklin, who has been employed by the New York Museum and is a famous contemporary American writer of pirate novels. Perhaps when "Treasure Island" is publicly screened, every reader's childhood fantasies about "Treasure Island" will all become reality. In the film, Wallace Beery plays the pirate, Jackie Cooper plays the young boy, Lionel Barrymore plays the old captain, and there are more than a hundred unimportant supporting roles.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Re-marriage" 丨丨 Xinguang</h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>American movies have a truly significant influence in China, which is universally acknowledged. Although "Re-marriage" is not entirely derived from American movies, some parts are influenced by them. We have seen "Idyll of the Fields" or other American movies that take materials from rural areas. The playwrights often contrast the simplicity of the countryside with the sins of the city, resulting in people clinging to the beautiful countryside and deeply hating the city, the source of evil. Naturally, this is not a correct concept, and in this regard, "Re-marriage" is no different from "Idyll of the Fields."</p>
<p>No, the main theme of "Re-marriage" is not in this area. What the playwright wants to show is the pitiful and ignorant old farmer, who has a son who does not learn well, resulting in a broken family and a miserable situation. However, on the other hand, we might as well reflect on it. If Gao Zhanfei, the character, did not study at a "wild chicken university" (naturally, the playwright deeply satirized the evils of education and the corruption of schools), he seemed to be able to study and become famous and become an official. In this way, he would not disappoint his old father, and his father would change from an old farmer to an old master. This point is probably an unforeseen side effect of the playwright.</p>
<p>In addition, we do not need to point out any greater significance in this film. What is pitiful is the old rich farmer, who wholeheartedly wants to rely on his son to make a name for himself, but has bad luck, and his son is useless. What can he do? As for spending four thousand yuan to become an official, the front door is sealed, but the back door can still be freely accessed, all of which are very realistic portrayals.</p>
<p>The director of "Re-marriage" has already shown some unique talent in "Wind" and is now demonstrating excellent skills here. He tells the story very clearly and concisely. He handles the atmosphere of the play very well, and the tone is also appropriate. Perhaps some say that there are some exaggerations, such as Xie Yunqing's encounter with all the prosperity and luxury when he arrives at his son's residence, which is a bit too contrived, and the description of Gao Qianping's temper is also a bit too exaggerated, making people feel like they are watching a play.</p>
<p>No problem, the director of this film is an excellent talent that our audience has high expectations for. However, excellent performance comes from the unity of content and form, and cannot exist solely on the technical aspect. That is to say, the director must decide his success on the entire work. Conversely, excellent technique does not express great and rich content, and its success is no more than that of a clever painter.</p>
<p>Finally, Yan Yuelan's performance as a social butterfly is more than competent. Gao Zhanfei and his wife were merely dutiful. The excellent cinematography added a lot to the beauty of the picture.</p>
<h3>Review of "Success in Life"</h3>
<p>— Wanshi (Stubborn Stone)</p>
<p>The Pursuit of Happiness</p>
<p>丨丨 Da Guangming</p>
<p>When feeling a lack of so-called subject matter, adopting readily available subject matter from novels or dramas has become the most convenient method for Hollywood. This "Success in Life" is another film adapted from a stage play.</p>
<p>Because it is derived from a stage play, it is always inevitably affected by the original work. For example, in the last scene, the appearance of a military officer allows several layers of difficulties and all the disputes to be eliminated. This kind of clever method is naturally not frequently found in modern dramas.</p>
<p>As a light comedy, it has had considerable success on the screen. Light, smooth, and bright, it makes people feel naturally happy. This is naturally very suitable for people who are tired and need to relax.</p>
<p>However, due to the decision of the story, other than achieving a sense of lightness and happiness, there are no other advantages. A comedy from the Washington era is truly too unfamiliar to us. Even if it accurately reflects the reality of that era, it does not give us a true and clear concept.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Talking about the Actors in "Plunder of Peach and Plum"</h3>
<p>— Jing Yi</p>
<p>"Plunder of Peach and Plum" has already been publicly screened at Jincheng. The film journals in various newspapers have already published articles on its consciousness, skills, and structure for days. Whether it is successful or not, there will be fair criticism, so there is no need for me to say more. I will talk about several important actors who have transferred from the stage to the screen for the first time.</p>
<p>Chen Boer, who is praised as the "little angel," I still remember her playing the younger sister in "All Quiet on the Western Front." At that time, she gave me a very good impression. I believe she is a very promising person. Sure enough, in "Plunder of Peach and Plum," she proved that my words were not false. In this film, she plays the cousin Li Lilin, transitioning from a lively virgin to a woman's attitude. The shyness and innocence of a virgin, as well as the fatigue and exhaustion of a woman after giving birth, are quite successful, and the scene of falling from the stairs is especially realistic.</p>
<p>Yuan Meizhi is a member of the Xinyou Drama Society and the Drama Association. I saw him perform in "Roar, China!" During filming for "Plunder of Peach and Plum," he was very hardworking from beginning to end. From graduation to imprisonment, in the middle of the process, he increased the tragic elements in his voice, makeup, and performance, which helped to advance the entire play.</p>
<p>Tang Huaiqiu is a veteran of the spoken drama world. He has founded many drama societies and has also starred in famous plays such as "Suzhou Night Talk" and "The Landlady." In this film, he plays Principal Liu, with the demeanor of an old man, not inferior to the old painter in "Suzhou Night Talk." His facial expressions, his composure, his actions, and his voice all match the identity of the character in the play.</p>
<p>Zhou Boxun has always been known for playing wealthy businessmen or gentlemen and has previously starred in "L'Arlésienne." In "Plunder of Peach and Plum," he plays a lecherous manager, and the kind of disgusting and laughable expression, carrying satire in humor, is also very good.</p>
<h3>About "Rebirth Flower"</h3>
<p>— Huo (Fire)</p>
<p>"Rebirth Flower" is the sequel to "Sister Flowers" and is Zheng Zhengqiu's painstaking masterpiece of the year.</p>
<p>The plot of "Rebirth Flower" is more painful and moving than "Sister Flowers" and is more tortuous and graceful.</p>
<p>There is a scene in which Da Bao is rescued from prison by Er Bao and returns to her own home. She is changing the dressing for Tao Ge'er, who is wounded, when Xiao Zhang suddenly comes to inform her that the marshal has sent troops to arrest her. The poor family has to get up and flee in a panic. Zhao Dama does not want to burden Da Bao because she is old and sick and finds it extremely difficult to move, so she desperately asks Da Bao and Tao Ge'er to escape first, and she is willing to fall behind. However, how could Da Bao and Tao Ge'er agree? But Zhao Dama insisted that they leave first. As a result, everyone cried together and was arrested. When you see this scene, your heart cannot help but become anxious and sick, and you will have to shed tears silently. (But)</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Golden Lotus Tribulation (Have a Heart) (5)</h3>
<p>— Shumin</p>
<p>Early the next morning, Jimmy took Sally's dog to return it to her. Sally didn't expect him to come so early. When she saw Mei coming in, she hurriedly tried to hide her foot under her clothes, but it was already too late. She said with shame, "I really didn't expect you to come so early. I didn't want you to know." Jimmy smiled and comforted her, "Oh, oh, oh, oh. You not only look like an angel, but you also speak like an angel." He went over and hugged her. Sally became happy again. But her happiness was very short-lived. Suddenly, someone was knocking on the door outside. Sally went to open the door, and a man named Mike walked in. He was the one who lent the car to Jimmy yesterday. When Mike saw Jimmy, he told him that the company had been robbed last night and the police were now arresting him. When Jimmy heard his words, because he was originally honest and selfless, he refused to escape and waited quietly for the police to find him. After a while, sure enough, the company's manager, Xiao Boer, came with the police. Xiao Boer told Jimmy that if he paid back the money, he would not pursue the matter. Jimmy argued that he had not stolen the money from the company, but the police did not allow him to explain and took Jimmy away, locking him up. Sally felt heartbroken when she saw Jimmy being taken away by the police. She had to find a way to save him. She had to save him quickly, because if he was sentenced, he would have to serve two years in prison. She thought for a day and a night, and early the next morning, she ran to the manager Mr. Xiao Boer's place. When she saw the manager, besides the two of them, there was also the manager's secretary, Han Lun, organizing documents on the side. Sally pleaded in front of the manager, "What you said yesterday, if Jimmy returns the money quickly, you would be willing not to pursue the matter, right?" Xiao Boer nodded. Sally immediately opened her purse and put a large stack of banknotes on the table and said, "This is four hundred yuan... because I am afraid that he will be sentenced to imprisonment... please forgive him especially... please find a way to release him quickly... please..." Xiao Boer nodded. He said, "That's right. I'll call immediately." As he spoke, he grabbed the phone. Sally had a smile on her face as she left. She could no longer go to cut and treat her foot... she didn't know when she could cut and treat it, or if she would ever have the chance... but she saved Jimmy, this was something she secretly rejoiced in.</p>
<p>While Sally went to see the manager, Joan and Gates were visiting Jimmy in prison. When Jimmy saw them, he first anxiously asked about Sally, and then asked Gates, "Did you find that person?" Gates said, "I have already found the night watchman, but he doesn't have silver dollar tattoos on both arms." Jimmy felt very strange and said, "Really? Did you see clearly?" Gates said, "How could I not see clearly?" After a while, a police officer came in and told Jimmy that he could go out for a walk, he had been released. Jimmy was extremely happy to hear this. He immediately ran to the company, but as soon as he got to the company, he became angry because the manager told him that although he had been released, his crime had not been cleared. Jimmy then asked who had taken the money to bail him out, but the manager refused to tell him. Later, he got some news from Han Lun that it was Sally who had taken the money to bail him out. As a result, Han Lun deliberately added, "Isn't it strange? I never suspected that you would steal that money. But when Sally came to see Xiao Boer today, she seemed to know that you stole it." Jimmy jumped up, "You mean Sally knew I stole it?" Han Lun nodded, "Of course, I knew it from her tone." Jimmy heard this. He rushed to the door with anger and walked out. He went to question Sally. He ran to Sally's place and questioned her fiercely, asking if she had taken out the money to bail him out? Sally showed a very pitiful look and said, "The money was taken out by me, but I thought..." Jimmy shouted wildly, "You made everyone believe that I am a thief... everyone... you yourself believe it." Sally quickly argued with him, "No, no, no. That's not true." (To be continued)</p>
