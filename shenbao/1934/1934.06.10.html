<p>時評</p>
<h3>整理外債與西原借欵問題經</h3>
<p>按西原借欵。係民國六七年間日本寺内内閣對華之借欵。以日本銀行家西原龜藏居間。故稱西原借欵。惟數目幾何。傳說不一。有謂三四萬萬元者。有謂二萬萬元者。近據日方發表則爲日金一萬三千萬元。借欵内容。分交通銀行借欵、有綫電信借欵、吉會路借欵、參戰借欵、山東濟順高徐鐵路借欵、滿蒙四鐵路借欵、及吉黑林鑛借欵等七項。蓋舉債時之假定用途如此。其實則日本藉歐洲大戰空前機會。與北洋軍閥相勾結。以遂其壟斷中國經濟權之野心。同時使其國内爲大戰影響而積聚之過剩金錢得一適當之尾　耳。據寺内内閣大藏大臣勝田主計之秘錄。當時成立各該偕欵。皆有其深刻之用意。如（一）交通銀行借欵。在使該行與與日本銀行間發生關係。以理解中國銀行業之内情爲目的。要求聘用日本人爲業務上之顧間。（二）有綫電信借欵。以中國政府關於全國有綫電信一切財産及收入爲担保。此外關於電信業。有僱聘外國技師及供給電信材料之必要時。日本皆有優先權。足以操縱中國有綫電信業之全部。（三）吉會路爲聯絡朝成。對於開發滿洲及聯絡朝鮮滿洲經濟之事件。必多非常之便利。（四）參戰借欵。隨中日軍事恊約而成立。恊約簽訂後。日本在大陸之地位。益臻鞏固。日本爲此恊約而援助中國財政。乃爲當然之義務。（五）日本驅逐德國勢力於山東之外。進一步而謀侵占經濟上絶對的優勝權。中國政府與日本約定。若敷設高密徐州綫用濟南順德綫時。先以目本事實。可圖日本商業貿易之便利。（六）滿蒙四鐵路。（六）滿蒙四鐵路。係指（甲）熱河至洮南之鐵路。（乙）洮南至長春之鐵路。（丙）吉林經海龍城至開原之鐵路。用（丁）從熱洮鐵路之一地點達於海港之鐵路。此等鐵路。此等鐵路。於滿蒙之經濟發達及與朝鮮之交通聯絡。皆爲必要。而第四線之建築。尤堪注目。蓋此綫一旦告成。可使日本聯絡朝鮮滿蒙及中國北數省。十分如意也。（七）林鑛爲吉黑兩省最豐富之天産物。借欵担保爲兩省金鑛及國有森林之全部及其收入。滿洲金之産額。日益增加。從日本方面言之。甚爲可喜。又由木材而論。日本建築材料或製紙材料。終不能不仰給於吉黑之森林。故投資於如此用途。不可不謂爲非常之有利也云。勝出之論調。大槪如此。然日人中以西原借欵成立之草率、條件之優厚、担保品之不確實等爲理由。而倡議反對者。亦不少也。</p>
<p>近日報章騰載。日本政府要求我國整　理舊債。而日本財團要人聯袂遊華。亦有積極活動之說。茲事體大。不可不加以研究也。</p>
<p>我國外債大體可分爲有確實担保與無確實担保二種。有確實担保者。易於整理。姑不具論。無確實担保者。則確爲極難爬梳之問題。</p>
<p>據北平前財政整理會所報告。我國全部不確實外債。爲國幣四八六·六四六·○○三元。其間由財政部經管之對日各項不確實債務。截止十四年年底。本息合計。折合國幣。約達三○五·三一五·六八七元之鉅。適當全數百分之六十三。</p>
<p>對日無確實擔保債務中。以西原借欵之數量爲最巨。而其整理亦最難。據日方發表。西原借欵之本金總額。合計日金一萬三千萬元。其内容包含交通銀行借欵·有綫電售借欵·吉會路借欵·參戰借欵·山東鐵路借欵·滿蒙四鐵路借欵·吉黑林礦鐵路借欵等七項。今日吾人是否有亟亟整理該項借欵之義務。第一當問其成立之背景。第二當問其用途之性質。西原借欵之完成。尙在民國七八年之間。時歐戰方酣。日本寺内閣乘歐洲列强自相殘殺無暇東顧之會。力圖與我國北洋軍人接近。以遂其對華獨佔侵略之目的。寺内内閣時代財政大臣勝田主計曾云。「大正五年之秋。寺内伯起而組織内閣。以對華經濟發展爲一大政綱。···因此該内閣存立中。帝國所獲之權利。遠過前代。」可見其躊躇滿志之一班矣。</p>
<p>寺内與勝田二人。以奬勵對華投資，助長對華貿易關係·支配中國金融機關爲政策。日本投資銀行。如興業·台灣·朝鮮等。在二人指導之下。遂不惜以當時過剩之巨額資金。供我國北洋軍人之揮霍。以圖政治經濟軍事各方之利益。借欵擔保品之是否確實。且不睱計及。更何論我國人民之公意。</p>
<p>是以所謂西原借欵。就其成立之背景言。特一日人用以侵略中國之經濟的武器。其很毒與在隈時代之廿一條較。未見多讓。决非尋常借欵所能比擬於萬一也。吾人試更進一步。而審察該借欵用途之性質。又知如吉會路滿蒙四路及吉黑林礦借欵等。無論其成立之動機何若。要皆以經營東北事業爲標榜者也。今日人旣佔我東北之土地市塲。攫我東北之財政資源。一方面奪人還債能力與債欵之擔保品。一方面又强人還債。縱以尋常借貸關係而論。亦决無是理。而况爲日人陰謀結晶之西原借欵乎。或者曰。「日人此舉。無非在藉端要挾而已。中國不願整理舊債。便須另舉新債。」無如舉債愈多。則受其束縛亦愈甚。我若不勝日人壓迫而至於就範。誠與自殺何異乎。</p>
<p>總之。整理外債。爲吾人一貫之立塲。日人提出正當要求。自不惜與之周旋。惟西原借欵含有特殊之性質與背景。日人必欲要求整理。其先還我借欵之擔保品來。無理苛求。嚴詞拒絶可矣。</p>

<h3>軍縮暫告小康　危局已經挽國　明日組委員會</h3>
<p>倫敦軍縮會阽危之局勢、已經挽回、總委員會今日在和平與友好空氣中開會、卽通過英法美三國總代表所商妥之折中提案、案内（一）重行聲明告成一般的公約實爲最急要之舉、（二）規定爲達此目的立卽工作之程序、（三）承認德國返會之必要、總委員會旣通過是案、軍縮會之工作、乃獲顯著之進步、於是總委員會宣布延會至下星期一日午後三時三十分、屆時將組織特委會二、一考慮歐洲區域安全恊定問題、一考慮公約實施與監督的擔保問題、</p>
<p>當是案通過前英代表艾登極言維持英法間傳統的友誼之重要、並謂有若干大國其合作爲必不可少者、現未與會致環境甚爲困難、但在此困難環境之下現已成立一種妥恊、英國對於德國脫離軍縮會之見解、始終不變、深覺自德國出會之後、軍縮主義與國際諒解、均已大受損礙、渠希望德政府在諒解所由得之改善的空氣中重行返會、以從事近兩年來恊同經營之工作云、</p>
<p>俄代表李維諾夫今日之態度、非常溫和、其融諧之精神、使各國代表爲之驚愕、李氏謂蘇俄從未反對提案中之任何點、渠希望俄國主張和平會議之觀念、常存在於各國内閣之文書庫中、赤軍之士兵、實爲世界中最實愛和平之人民俄國誓與各民族及各政府恊同經營、以獲得世界之和平云、</p>
<p>意代表索拉格那與波蘭代表拉津斯基均提出保留意代表聲明非俟政治問題解决後、渠恐軍縮會未必能獲適當之進步、李維諾夫對於提案、亦不絶對滿意、故當提案正式提出時、未投票、</p>
<p>主要代表均於今夜返國、故軍縮會之空前的驚濤駭浪、已暫告寗靜、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）自台維斯妥協案成立、軍縮前</p>
<p>途大爲樂觀、而會議卽行破裂之危機、目前似已過去、總委員會通過之决議案、明</p>
<p>白表示邀請德國重返議席實出美代表斡旋之賜、聞英代表團曾於事前接奉倫敦訓令、謂如不留對德續談之餘地、則不必進行會議、意大利代表團亦抱同一態度、台維斯案一面容納法國主張、將保安及裁軍兩大問題交由各委員會繼續討論、一面規定大會休會、以俟邀請德國重返問題得有眉目後、再行召集、故此决議案</p>
<p>對於邀請德一點、曾作明白之規定、此案</p>
<p>聞已分致與會各國政府備案、軍縮會議或將卽此休會二三月、以利進行法德妥恊談判、及接洽德國重返國聯、故軍縮會議尙可延長數月之久、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）軍縮總委員會今日將台維斯案通過、規定無定期休會、休會期内、四委</p>
<p>員會繼續研究各項軍縮建議、並進行德國重返會議之談判、星期一午後總委員會將再開會、着手設立台維斯案中之四委員會、此案已爲法英一致接受、專家評　此案稱、上面對於將來之裁軍問題可謂已得妥恊、然仍隱藏英法德意四國對於基本問題之巨大隔閡、法俄携手是否將使英法邦交惡化、致使使國重返國聯大或困難、則尙在未知之數、總委員會是期一開會時、各國代表將力爭委員會入選、然後悄然閉會至十月、再視對德接洽形勢而定進退、日本並未參加昨日或今日之密議實堪重視、總委員會於今日下午四時十分開會、至六時十分宣告休會、至下星期一台維斯案由法外長巴爾都提出、巴爾都堅稱、法國希望德國自動重返日内瓦、巴爾都之言曰、吾人聽任德國自由行動、德國自閉其門戶、則吾人不能將其開放、惟有德國始能開放此門戶、吾人不欲行封鎖政策、此非吾人所抱之主義也云云、台維斯宣稱、此案於歐洲　平大</p>
<p>有供獻云、台氏之言曰此案並未解决全部軍縮間題然已使大會空氣由失望而轉換至眞正有望云、蘇俄外交委員長李維諾夫贊成此案、稱其實無反對之點云、李維諸夫更希望其提出之不侵犯公約及改組軍縮會議爲和平會議之建議、不再爲外交家束之高閣、而能重付討論云、六中立國亦表示接受、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>各國代表態　度蘇俄亦贊成妥恊案　意匈保留奥無表示</h3>

<p>尤謂巴爾都對英法國交所發之言深爲可感、艾登謂决議草案證明英法國交之羣固、英國極欲軍縮會議能得到結果、而不願曠日持久從事於空泛之討論、以此原因、故接受三國代表所商定之妥恊案、希望軍縮會議之空氣爲之一新、而德國亦得重返日内瓦、德國退出軍縮會議釀成今日之困難、並爲歐洲和平增加危險、實負相當責任、自有此次妥協案之後、德國可重行參加軍縮之工作矣、美國代表台維斯謂、各國不可不互相妥恊、因此美國亦贊成三國代表新定之妥恊案、蘇俄外委李維諾夫則謂、蘇俄對妥恊案並不十分滿意、但其中並未包含任何事項足使蘇俄代表反對者、瑞典外長散特婁代表六國（瑞典·瑞士·荷蘭·丹麥·挪威·西班牙·）發言、謂渠以爲英美法三國代表新定之妥恊案、能援助軍縮會議、予以解决、匈牙利代表叙述該國之要求、對妥協案提出明白之保留、意大利代表蘇拉尼阿將其對主席團所作之保留、重行說明、但又謂意大利願於形式及程序問題以外繼續與各國合作、以便對於各種重大國際問題得到和平解决、保加利亞代表米葛夫宣言贊成妥恊案、奥國代表則不擬表示意見、波蘭代表拉泰斯基謂法國妥恊案使會議空氣和緩、深爲可幸、旋又將其對主席團所作之保留重行說明、最後波斯代表發言、至是妥恊案遂爲總委員會所通過、而無人反對、出席軍縮會議之五</p>

<h3>特載　桂省經濟調查印象記（續）千家駒</h3>
<p>再我來說一說富賀鐘的櫎業、富賀鐘乃「富川」「賀縣」「鐘山」三縣之總稱、爲廣西産礦最著名的區域、廣西建設廳在鐘山之西灣設有駐富賀鐘辦事處、西灣離八步約三十里、辦事處自有運貨車一輛、行駛其間、任何人如要參觀、祗消打一電話去、該辦事處就會派車來接的、辦事處主任陶紹勤先生、乃一留德學生、富有地質學識與礦務經騐、據陶君說、富賀鐘以産錫爲最多、開採公司大小合計不下四百餘家、但除二三公司用機器開採外、（賀成·普益·寳華·三公司）餘均用土法開採、土法開採又分數種、有所謂「窿口」者、這是指錫沙在山脈裏面、要從山口中開一窿進去開採的、如果山窿裏面有水源可以洗沙的、稱之爲「水窿」、無水源的爲「旱窿」、（錫沙須以水冲洗、故水窿較旱窿爲佳）、又有謂「莊頭」者、這是指露天地面上開掘錫沙的、也有「水莊」與「旱莊」之别、這種土法開採的公司、資本大的有達數千元、少的甚至祗數百元、這地方的土人往往集資數百元、買了一塊地皮、就自己開採起來、工資是不計算的、掘得的錫沙、就出售給提練錫礦的公司、大槪每百斤錫沙可售一百二三十元、煉成純錫約七十斤左右、每百斤純錫的成本（連稅捐在内）約二百十元、在八步售價二百二十元、廣州售價二百四十餘元、香港售價二百七八十元、近一二年來、因香港錫價高漲、錫商獲利甚豐、所以開採的益多、産錫量也大爲增加、就中幾個以機器開採的大公司、股東多爲南洋回國的華僑、他們受也界經濟恐慌巨潮的打擊、在南洋立不住脚跟、於是轉其目光於國内實業的投資了、這種華僑、其精神與魄力眞足令我們敬仰、他們多是肥肥的身軀、穿着古式短短的西服、拿着根手杖、整天在礦區中跑、令我們看就知道他們是勤儉起家的僑商、但他們對付工人的苛刻、却也不能不爲之吃驚、普益施仁公司中關於礦工的遵守規則、有「每工人扣儲工薪五天、如不辭而行、卽予以沒收」的規定、立頭的寳華公司對於礦工待遇規則中規定着、「工人如無故辭工、未滿七工的工資可不發給、如因工作死亡、廠方給予十元之葬費、與百日工資的撫卹金」、說到工人的生活、那眞是不及北平的囚犯、他們住居在最破爛最齷齪的寄宿舍中、這種寄宿舍與監獄唯一不同之點、就在監獄大多是堅厚的牆壁、而他們則爲破報紙糊的紙板監獄是鐵窗緊閉、而這些是門戶洞開吧了、工人中十之八九是無家室獨身漢、開礦時全身赤裸、僅在腹部圍着一塊破布、襤褸有如乞丐、而骯髒則倍之、至礦塲内衛生之設備、危險的防禦、那根本不要說起、又在我們的意中、假若他們有死亡登記的話、我們相信、富賀礦工死亡率之高、一定可以開新紀元的吧、因爲礦工們的生命時時感受列死神的威脅、所以他們迷信一種所謂「寳皇爺」、這種「寳皇爺」爲鐘乳石所成、位置於洞口之兩旁、他們於進窿採掘之前、一定要焚香拜禱一次、說這樣就可以避免進窿後頭昏目眩、保佑得平安出來這種迷信、我們如不由工人勞動環境上去看、是得不到解釋的、</p>
<p>富賀鐘除錫礦外、西灣一帶、還産有小量的煤、煤礦自西灣起、向西與北延長、煤層縱約四五里、橫約二十餘里、惟西灣之煤質並不甚佳、且産量有限、僅足供煉錫之用、現在西灣共有四個煤公司、都是窿口、開採出來的且往往全部爲砂泥石片、有終日不得煤一斤者、煤礦儲藏量的貧乏、可說是廣西重工業的致命傷、</p>
<p>總之、富賀鐘錫量的蘊藏是很豐富的、所可惜的是採錫公司太多、而資本又太少、政府旣沒有大規模之開採計劃、結果祗有讓那許多小公司用最原始的採礦工具、如鋤鍬鏟鑿、亂掘一陣、卽沒有系統、也沒有計劃、錫砂豐富的地方就開了一些、錫砂較少的就中途廢棄、使一片最好的礦床、五馬分屍、亂七八糟、經開掘而深陷的地方、旣不塡塞、開掘出的來泥土、亦亂置如山、正如一塊肥肉、剜得滿目瘡痍、將來礦量旣盡、欲恢復農田、以植五谷、亦不可得、如何補救這種缺憾、當局是不能不負全責的、</p>
<p>我們在八步住了四天、於十月十四日離開了八步、坐車返平樂、再由平樂買舟赴梧州、平樂到梧州當五·六·七·八·九等月河水泛漲時、可通電船、二日可達、但至冬春水涸、灘多流急、祗可行駛民船、下水船至少亦須四日、上水且倍这、我們返平樂時正是水涸的時候、電船已經不通了、所以祗得乘民船、由着她慢慢的走、這種民船的艙位是很小的、船寬剛剛可以陲一個人、低低的蓬、腰是挺不直的、我們祗能整天躺着、或斜坐着、有時偶而跑到船頭上去伸伸腰、看看靑山綠水、聽聽舟夫搖漿、這樣的光陰居然過了四天、才算把我們帶到梧州了、</p>
<p>梧州、我們前面已說過、牠是「廣西的上海」是桂省（以及滇黔）進出口貿易薈萃集中之點、近幾年來、進口貿易因受農村破産農民購買力减低的影響、大爲减退、而出口貿易又受世界經濟恐慌怒潮的打擊、衰敗得更不堪設想、在農村凋弊與世界恐慌兩重的夾攻下、梧州變成了負罪的羔羊了、我們在梧州住時、在商人個别談話中、在商會中、在廠家和工人中、每天都聽到悲苦的歎聲、他們莫不是追慕過去、懞憧未來而失望於現在、梧州最大的商行是平碼行與水面行、（代客買賣、卽北方的所謂牙行、或經紀行Ｂｒｏｋｅｒ）、這幾年最受打擊的也就這兩行、譬如以出口貨來說、桂省出口貨的大宗是桐油·生油·茶米、近年來、除桐油尙年有出口（據估計、去年出口約十萬担、民十六七時有十五萬担、約减退三分之一）外、他如生油、則因受山東生油的影響、香港市塲全被靑州油所侵奪、谷米則自二十年以降、反每年有巨量洋米入口、出口谷米也因受不起洋米傾銷的打擊、在省外市塲銷路漸窄、不能立足、當然這些貨物不是梧州本地的出産、牠們是從柳州撫河邕河各産區來的、近來、來貨固已减少、但是這少量的存貨還是找不到銷路、當我們在柳州·桂林·平樂······等處旅行時、間商人土貨出口减少的原因、他們唯一的答便是「梧州沒有價錢」、現在到了梧州、所得的答案又是「香港廣州沒有價錢」了、「沒有價錢」把廣西出口貿易毁了、這不是物價跌落與世界經濟恐慌最好的縮影嗎、他如苛捐雜稅的重生剝削、運輸的困難、生活費用的高昻、都把商人們擊落到失望的深淵中去的、</p>

<h3>顧馨一　談救濟麵粉原則確定　治標：實財鐵交四部負責解决　治本：官商合作力謀麥質改良</h3>
<p>中央社云、關於救濟麵粉一事、迭經政府當局曁麵粉廠商之努力、業將各項救濟</p>
<p>重要原則、加以確定、値茲以産麥著稱之美國、因今年適逢災荒、産量見减、故各方現均亟謀挽救、茲據本市麵粉鉅子顧馨一談如下、</p>
<h3>治標治本雙方進行</h3>
<p>據顧氏談、本人前赴首都、與實部當局、交換關於救濟麵粉之意見、此事現决定從治標治本雙方着手、治標方面、在運輸上、謀稅額之减輕、及之費之减低、實業部對於此事、將與財政·鐵道·交通·三部會商、負責謀解决、此次財政會議、對於統稅一事、曾通過應一律待遇、故麵粉統稅、得依照其他各貨物、分等抽稅、凡頭二等麵粉則分級抽稅、三四等麵粉、則予以免稅、此事如辦到、則成本上或可較低减、至於治本方面、將使麥子本質上謀改良、對於各産麥區域、往往雜以泥沙、以圖增加分量、此種偷巧辦法、必謀根本改良、以上各事、將由地方政府及雜糧商、力謀改善、</p>
<h3>美麥災荒價或提高</h3>
<p>關於麵粉市塲、所以一蹶不振者、最大原因、由於供過於求之所致、而所以供過於求者、則又爲外麥在國内傾銷之故、查近年來美麥之入口、其數殊足驚人、使國麥</p>
<p>銷路、反見停滯、現聞美國産麥區域、因受災荒、産量大見减少、其數不及往年之半、故預料美國麥市塲、或有提高價格之趨勢、如此、則美麥或可停止輸運來華、如美麥不再來華、而國麥在稅額及運價均可得减輕負担、則麵粉事業、亦因之得有挽救之轉機、記者旋訽以美國近因發生罷工風潮、以致我國曾向美所借麥粉停運來華、此事對於我國麥粉市塲、有無影響、據答、我國麵粉廠商之所以陷於今日之不景氣、美粉入口、亦頗多關係、但當時我國與美當局商借者、僅爲麥子、麵粉一事、初未論及、旋以美國一般麵粉廠商、因政府祗以麥子出口、原料方面、旣感缺乏、而一般麵粉廠工、或將因此蒙失業影響、遂要求政府應搭借麵粉、旋經多次交涉、减至四成、至於美國停運風潮、當亦不過一種暫時之事、我人不能因此而樂觀、惟美國旣以受麥荒之影響、如能因此而將未運麥粉停運來華、則我國麥粉市塲、當有轉機、但自東北爲日人所攫取後、因該處原爲我國麵粉銷售之最大市塲、現雖有極少數之麵粉運往該處銷售、但一切均爲日人所操縱、此實爲我國麵粉事業之致命傷</p>
<h3>粤徴收農産稅未聞</h3>
<p>記者復詢以報載廣東將於本月十六日開征農産稅、故上海各廣帮、有大宗糧食成交、據顧氏稱、此事本人未有所聞、但粤省當局曾有肥料稅之征收、此項稅收、原爲移作廣東中山大學之建築經費、以致本市運往之大批豆餅、因納稅關係、被扣在粤、迭經各方證明、并請陳濟棠代表楊德昭電陳解疏、商人方面、亦電請中山大學校長鄒魯·體念商艱、當蒙粤省當局對於國内所産豆餅入粤、一律免征肥料稅、至於報傳農産稅一事、或爲此事所誤傳、蓋最近雜糧市塲中、并無所謂太宗雜糧之成交、一切均與平日交易相同云、</p>
<h3>市府轉令所屬　重申保護新聞記者</h3>
<p>中央社云、本市市政府日前特轉令所屬重申保護新聞記者文云、案准内政部警字第一零六三號咨開、案准行政院秘書處第一九七二號函開、奉院長諭、國民政府交辦中央秘書處函、爲請重申保護新聞記者令一案、應交内政軍政兩部等因、抄同原附各件、函達查照等由准此、查前奉行政院第三九二一號訓令、以奉中央交辦江蘇省黨部呈請保護新聞事業人員一案、轉飭遵照等因、當經本部以警字第二二六五號咨請查照、并飭屬遵照在案、茲准函轉中央宣傳委員會、此次召集新聞宣傳會議、以據江西省黨部提謂、保障新聞記者安全案、經决議、呈請中央轉函國民政府、重申保護新聞記者令、錄案交辦到部、自應重申前令、切實保護、俾新聞事業得以發展、除分行并函復及咨達軍政部外、相應抄同原附抄函及提案、咨請查照、并轉飭所屬、一體遵照爲荷等由、計抄送原抄函及提案各一件、准此、除分令外、合行抄發原附件、令仰知照、此令、計抄發原抄函及提案各一份、市長吳鐵城、</p>

<p>言之、儲戶總數已有十三萬餘全會、是其每月儲欵之收入、達一百六十萬、以一年計之、則不下二千萬、而中法尙不與焉、以此偌大數目之金錢、何一非吾國民之血汗、顧竟一任外籍商人之操縱把持、吾國政府、旣無監督過問之機會、脫或一且發生事故、則此八九千萬之國人血汗、必盡化爲烏有、猶憶曩昔東方銀行儲蓄公司</p>
<h3>倒騙鉅欵</h3>
<p>一案、國人血汗、均爲囊括以去、且其儲蓄性質、則又與今日之萬國·中法·初無二致也、覆車可鑒、能不恫然、此其一、且夫儲蓄美德也、亦所以提倡國民節儉者也、然而該兩會徒藉儲蓄之名、以鉅額之奬金爲餌、誘致一般愚夫愚婦、以其終年辛勤所得之汗血金錢、懵然加入、冀圖僥倖獲中鉅奬、而不熟計其間利害、卽或一旦覺悟則又欲罷不能、否則其已繳納之儲本、胥必付諸流水、間能領還者、亦必受層層之剝削、查此種不正當之有奬儲蓄、早經我中央政府嚴厲禁止、我國銀行之曾辦理此種儲蓄者、均奉令</p>
<h3>停止經營</h3>
<p>而外人經營下之該兩會、竟違令繼續開辦、以迄於今、殊屬不能再任其遷延、若不加禁止、微特有害民生、抑月影響於正當有益之儲蓄者、至深且鉅、蓋國民旣投資於有奬儲蓄、復爲一種僥僥心所障蔽、則其對於正當儲蓄、勢難兼顧、甚至裹足不前、故今日如欲提倡國民眞正之儉德、而求正當儲蓄之發展者、必毅然决然、自嚴禁有奬儲蓄始、所謂不塞不流不止不行者是也、此共二邇來農村</p>
<h3>經濟破産</h3>
<p>羣以内地現金集中都市爲慮、而該兩會之有奬</p>
<p>儲蓄資金、不啻全部來自内地農工商各階級中者、且其大部份、又轉而流出國外、其影響所及、貽害我國實業者、不可勝言、蓋今日資金集中都市、猶可轉由金融界投資内地補救之、一旦流出國外、則無資人以商戰之利器、國家焉得不窮民生焉得不盛、此其</p>
<p>三、綜之、事實如此、屬會非敢故作危討、以聳聽聞也、所有該兩會之有奬儲蓄、亟應禁止緣由、理合具呈鑒核、務懇俯念輿情、從速禁止、實爲德便、謹呈、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>論生活的矛盾（三）</h3>
<p>前，昨兩日我們討論了生活的矛盾的根源及生活矛盾表現在思想與思想方面，今日再就思想與行動、行動與行動的矛盾而加以解說：作者最着重的是以下要討論的「怎樣克服行爲上的矛盾」明天作一天登出。希望讀者特别注意明天的結語。編者</p>
<p>四，思想與行動的矛盾，行動與行動的矛盾</p>
<p>我們常常看見一個人口裏說得漂亮，筆下寫得漂亮，但一問他的行爲，不免現出二重人格。我們也常看見一個人的行動前後不能一致。這些都是本節要說明的問題。</p>
<p>這種現象表現在近代人的生活上特别的顯著。近代人對於當前的社會多數表示不滿，於是他們在思想方面常常能接受較進步的一面，反業腐爛了的一面。但他在行動上依然是保守的，不能前進一步，顯然是現出二重人格。他們有時因爲這分裂也現出幾分苦惱，也曾爲調和或克服這分裂努力過，但能眞的做到思想與行動統一的實在是極少數。這不用說是由於他的特殊生活條件。一個慈善家他只能有幾分淺薄的同情，他却不能過貧困的生活，混入饑餓隊中去。他的了解貧困不是從實生活中獲得的，他是站在看客的地位，覺昨有點不忍而已。所以思想與行動的矛盾現象中，思想的發展雖不能完全否認，可是它發展到一定的界限（卽超過他的生活的容忍）就必然終止了。我們回顧辛亥革命，卽可以澈底的了解。在辛亥革命中接受革命理論的確是不乏其人，能參加實踐的，就不能不說是少數了。尤其就當日與黃克强先生共過患難的，以後敗退下來的人說，革命我是贊同的，但我因爲過不慣流浪，冐險的生涯，我不能那般的犧牲，我不能完全放棄我的私生活的幸福，於是我不能不退出革命行動。這確是老實的自白。其實，像這樣的人，他對於革命的了解不能說深刻。他是脫離了實踐而空言革命的。所以，卽令他願意在理論上深入，結果仍有一定的限度，或者反走入玄學中去。</p>
<p>就讀書說，我們也可發現同類的現象。羅君是好文學的靑年，據他的來信說，他常常自覺自己的淺薄，想特别對社會科學用點工夫，使自己對於社會的認識更加深化。但是，他在思想方面是如此，在行動方面就完全兩樣，他不慣讀硬性的社會科學，他無興趣。這自然不是偶然的。這仍然要拿羅君的生活來解釋。羅君的生活是很案適的，他之不滿現狀，要認識社會是限糢糊的。他完全過的是十足有有閑生活。他養成爛漫的習慣了。他的不滿是不過是因今日之國際狀况及中國民族危機對他的一點浮薄的刺激，他的實生活，卽個人的私生活，仍是平平安安的。他從未經歷過生活的奮鬭，也自然不會感覺要取得一套生活奮鬭的戰略的。研究文學在他原是消閑，所謂要求認識社會也不過是膚淺的印象，一時的興奮罷丁。有人或者要說，這要歸之於習慣，其實不然，卽令是習慣也要用社會生活環境來說明纔對。</p>
<p>阻礙思想與行動的統一還可用其他的社會原因來說明，比如就未婚靑年的常犯手淫這一事件說，每個犯手淫的人，沒有不知道手淫的害處的，在思想方面，大槪都是反手淫主義者罷！在行動方面，他們剛剛反其所爲。這是大家公認的事實，在郁達夫先生的沈淪中已有過典型的描寫了。這種矛盾現象固然是屬於生理方面的。其實，造成這種病態，仍要歸到社會制度（特别是習慣如禁慾主義）方面去。因爲這種矛盾明明通過社會原因而産生的。</p>
<p>此外，在一種過嚴重的壓迫，或恐怖下亦常常促成思想與行動的分裂。譬如在西洋史中，神聖同盟折大反動，一九○五年沙皇主義大反動下，使許多人，隱藏在各種生活領域，使他的思想灣灣曲曲的生長。</p>
<p>總之，思想與行動間的矛盾，大致是因爲社會實踐的躍進，和人的認識不足，使人的思想與行動分裂。思想每每走到前頭，行動追趕不上及其他許多客觀原因的結果。</p>
<p>至於行動與行動間的矛盾，這可由思想的躍進與退後來說明，這是生活矛盾最表面的方面。我們祗要看社會實踐的變化，與之同變化的，我們常常可以看出有些人慣會脫下一件衣裳，穿上另一件顔色完全不相同的。這也不足爲怪。人的生活原來是時時刻刻在變化。雖然如此，一個人的變化的也有一定的限度的。决定這限度的東西仍是個人生活着的社會特殊生活環境。</p>
<p>以上的說明，不過在於矛盾的解釋，不是替矛盾現象的辯護。我們覺得一個人的生活不怕有矛盾，也不能否認有矛盾，我們應該注意的是能收矛盾的現象作合理的解釋。我們不僅要解釋矛盾，同時要改變生活上不合理的矛盾現象。我們應收生活過程矛盾性，能動的加以利用，克服有妨害我們生活的矛盾。以下我們進而有力的提出如何克服行爲上的，有害於我們生活發展的矛盾。</p>

<h3>讀書和游戲</h3>
<p>— 寒玉</p>
<p>讀書是需要的，但游戲也是需要的。</p>
<p>讀書可以增加我們的智識，游戲可以把已經用過的腦力，經過了游戲之後，漸漸地恢復過來，所以這都是小朋友們所需要的工作，但是我們不可以一天到晚的讀書，也不可以一天到晚的遊戲。</p>
<p>一天到晚的讀書，可以使我們的腦力弄到了混亂的程度，我們所要讀的書，因了腦力混亂的緣故，一些益處也不能得到；一天到晚的遊戲，縱然是荒廢我們的光陰，一些智識也不能得到。祗有讀了一刻兒書，再經過一刻兒的遊戲，那麽也可充分的得到智識，但是腦力一些也不會混亂。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們是一天到晚的讀書或遊戲呢？還是讀了一刻書，再遊戲的呢？這是一個很可注意的問題，你們也應該注意到！</p>
<p>但是同時，小朋友也應該注意到玩的遊戲或讀的書，是不是有用的？</p>
<h3>自私</h3>
<p>— 隆士</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們不是很喜歡聽故事嗎？讓我來講給你們聽吧！</p>
<p>一隻狐狸被獵戶們捉住了，因爲要想逃出鐵籠，所以它的尾巴被機關門所截斷。回山以後，它看見同類都有一條很粗的尾巴，覺得自己的缺點是極羞恥的，如果可以的話，一定情願死在鐵籠裏。最後它想出一件最好的補救方法，去召集一個會議，目的要請其他的狐狸都照它的樣子把尾巴割掉。</p>
<p>「這是毫無意識的，」它在會議上說：「我現在的行動很便利適意，假使我不曾嘗試過，我也决不會相信我的話是對的。無論那人都說：一條尾巴一種很難看而無用的東西，爲什麽我們都要有一條極長的尾巴呢？兄弟呀！你們跟我一樣割掉尾巴，就可以得到許多的利益呢」！</p>
<p>一隻老狐狸上前說：「朋友！我再三的想過，你不必請求我們捨去尾巴，只要你自己有機會再生上去好了。」</p>
<p>小朋友！上面的故事中，明晰的告訴我們丨丨自私可以妨害公衆的利益，自私的人就是公共的仇敵。</p>
<h3>夏季的衛生</h3>
<p>— 伯眞</p>
<p>節季的巨輪，漸漸的從溫和的春季轉到炎熱的夏季了。</p>
<p>人們夏季的仇敵丨蒼蠅，蚊子，以及其他一切微生物，有的已經出現了，有的也正在繁殖了。</p>
<p>萬物之靈的人們，都紛紛的想法怎麽樣去抵抗仇敵，消滅仇敵，這呌做衛生。這是小朋友們人人所應當知道的</p>
<p>（一）個人的衛生：</p>
<p>積極方面：不喝冷水。不吃蒼蠅已吃過的食物。食物必須要安放在蓋罩裏。不吃隔夜已腐敗的東西。蚊蟲香，滅蠅器，也是夏季不可缺少的東西。</p>
<p>消極方面：不要有污穢的水，盛樍在缸中。糞缸要有蓋。水裏有了孑孓，要趕緊消滅。居室都要裝紗窗，紗門。</p>
<p>（二）公衆衛生：</p>
<p>積極方面：服務社會的團體，像靑年會等，應該重價收買死蠅。買蒼蠅拍分送給無錢的貧民。同時設立時疫醫院，染時疫病而沒錢醫治的貧民，得到醫院免費診療。</p>
<p>消極方面：在冬季時，應該派人去搜集蒼蠅和蚊子的遺卵。把卵完全消滅。河道裏街衢上不可有已腐敗的東西堆積和抛棄，像西瓜皮和死狗死貓等。</p>
<p>以上所講的都是夏季衛生的重要設施。</p>
<h3>早起太倉蕉弇角小學校學生  吳永康</h3>
<p>早起！你要起得早；起來看太陽，太陽顔色好，看見月亮要沒了，彎彎一線像眉毛，看見彩雲一條條。</p>
<p>條條花紋都精巧，花兒吐香氣，小鳥吱吱呌，</p>
<p>我早上起來洗臉畢，背了書包到學校，老師說：「你能早起眞正好！」</p>
<h3>「蛙媽媽」</h3>
<p>— 素素</p>
<p>本來蛙媽媽怕冷，躱在泥窟裏不敢出來的，後來春姑娘去敲伊的門，伊才探出頭來看。「啊！美麗極了！姑娘」蛙媽媽快樂得很，同時去呌醒了大蛙和小蛙們！</p>
<p>春姑娘很快樂，帶着，大蛙，小蛙和蛙媽媽到翠綠的麥田裏去旅行。剛走到麥田裏，就看見麥弟弟被許多許多小蟲兒在欺侮，蛙媽媽氣得兩隻眼睛像燈龍一樣。伊跳過去，把那些不講公理的小蟲兒一個個呑食了。伊還對麥弟弟說：「我以後永遠作你的衛隊，保護你的健康，一從此麥弟弟很快樂，在田野裏不時的點着頭。</p>
<p>有一天，蛙媽媽從泥田裏出來到池塘裏去洗澡，看見許多穿黑衣服，拖尾巴的小蟲，蛙媽媽想：「這一定又是害稻麥的敵人了，伊計劃着怎樣去殺害伊們，」不料在這個當兒，小蟲兒都跑過去媽媽！媽媽！的亂呌。蛙媽媽看見伊們都穿着黑衣服，就厲聲的道：「你們沒有穿上像我一樣的綠衣服，我是不認識你們的呀！一小蟲兒心裏很難過，坐在池兒塘裏發愁，剛巧春姑娘走過，小蟲去問春姑娘，「綠衣到那裏去找的？」春姑娘很詫異的說：「你們的脚，還沒有長出來，這麽你們的衣服會變綠色的呢？」小蟲兒聽說自己的脚沒有長出來，伊們就天天去運動下肢運動。</p>
<p>過了二十多天，小蟲的脚果然長出來了，黑衣服也變了綠衣服了，小蟲兒心裏很快樂，就到泥田裏去找她們的媽媽</p>
<h3>癟氣橡皮球烤火後</h3>
<p>— 孔皆</p>
<p>寳哥和毛弟找到一隻癟氣的橡皮球因爲彈不起，沒法玩。</p>
<p>這時，正好他們的哥哥走過，聽了他們的話便把這球放在火上烤，不一會已變成一隻堅硬而富有彈性的皮球了。</p>
<p>寳哥和毛弟沒一會又跑了回來，向哥哥說：「你看，這球比以前更癟了。」說</p>
<p>着把球遞給哥哥。</p>
<p>哥哥拿着球笑了笑說：「這是我和你們鬧着玩的，不要懊喪：明天給你們買一隻新的，你們知道這球烤後變硬又癟下去的原因嗎？」</p>
<p>兩人一同搖了搖頭。</p>
<p>哥哥便接下去說：「現在，我們知道，世界上每一件東西都是由許多細小的微粒，呌分子的構成，這些分子是這麽小就是用極强度的顯微鏡也看不出，我們把球放在在火上一烤這就是說使皮球裏空氣的分子動得更快，分子跑動得很快的時候便難免碰撞，排擠，分子向四面排擠的結果使皮球變大，但是這時一部分的空氣因受排擠而由皮球的細縫中鑽出來，這球一冷下去，分子也便慢慢的走動，於是皮球便癟了下去，又因爲有一部分的空氣已受排擠而出球外，所以現在球竟更癟了」。</p>
<p>實哥兒倆知道了這理由，一齊點了點頭，很快樂地跟着哥哥去買球了。</p>
<h3>父兄們的錯</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>早年讀魯迅的散文，據說魯迅先生在童時曾撕毁他弟弟周作人先生的一隻紙鳶，在那時候，魯迅先生以爲放紙爲鳶是無賴子弟所做的沒出息的行爲，身爲兄長，當然是應該負責糾正的。但是他之後讀到了些關於兒童心理學的書籍，便知道從前對他弟弟的干涉是十分無理的了。中年時，他曾對弟弟說過，彷彿還帶了點愧意，然而周作人先生却已完全忘懷了，丨文章的大意是如此，作者在末尾更表示要天下的父兄們都改正像他那樣的錯誤，用心是可佩的。　　在沒有讀到那篇文章之前，我實在也犯了和魯迅先生同樣的錯誤，我曾撕毁二弟三弟許多隻紙鳶，那麽嚴厲地。可是後來便覺悟了，并且還非難二弟蹈我的覆轍去撕毁五弟六弟的紙鳶呢。最近南京曾有風筝比賽，林主席等都有奬品，也可見那比賽的盛况了。林主席等爲什麽要提倡風筝？那自然有着極充份的理由的。由此，我想特别提出來說一說：放紙鳶，放風筝，於兒童身心的培養是很有益處的。内地的無數父兄們，請你們立卽改正了那個橫加干涉的錯誤罷！</p>
<h3>二百年來輪船事業的進步丨從最簡陋的輪船到現代式的輪船丨</h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>一最早的小輪船丨赫爾氏的拖船（一七三七年）二德喬夫勞的輪船（一七八三年）三費區的有槳小輪船（一七八六年）四雪明敦的雙聯小輪船（一七八八年）五雪明敦騰達號輪船（一八○一年）六第一隻成功的輪船：富爾敦的克雷蒙號（一八○七年）七倍爾的彗星號輪船（八一二年）八橫渡大西洋的沙凡那號（一八一九年，九雪里斯號輪船（一八三八年）十大西號輪船（同上）一不列塔尼號（一八四○年）一二不列顚號輪船（一八四四年）一三現代式的莫里塔尼號（一九○七后</p>
<p>最初輪的船是一個名呌赫爾氏的製成的，但是它的機器在艙裏佔去了大部份地位，以致不能容載貨物或乘客，只能用來當作拖船罷了。在赫氏之後近五十年間，製造輪船的事業沒有多大的進步，但是過了不久，各國人士研究輪船的興趣又濃厚起來，我們看到英國人與法國人的種種試騐，我們又看到富爾敦的克雷蒙號。富爾敦是美國人。第一隻成功輪船是他製成的。沙凡那號於一八一九年渡過了大西洋，不過它僅僅在路程的首段與末段用蒸汽來發動，中間的路程仍舊是靠了帆篷駛過的，純粹利用蒸汽的力量而渡大西洋的，却要算兩隻英國英國輪船丨雪里斯號與大西號丨了，它們先後於數小時之内由英國開到紐約。從那時起，輪船的進步就非常之快，它的體積也永遠在增加着，現代的輪船已非當初簡陋狹小的輪船可比了。</p>
<h3>水鳥</h3>
<p>— 石愚生</p>
<p>大江干海濱，我們小朋友曾見過那傍著金黃波浪飛掠的種一鳥嗎？看去，它們是那樣的悠然，那樣的閒適；小朋友，你這可就錯了！它們有極刻毒的眼，極兇殘的爪，它們輕巧地飛着，目光卻注在波心：貪玩的魚兒一探頭，便一爪抓去了！它們不停地在波上逡巡，可憐的魚兒也不斷地被它們宰殺。小朋友，這是甚麽鳥呀？這就是敵人對我們施行「水鳥外交」的水鳥啊！</p>
<p>小朋友，敵人陰毒的做「水鳥，」我們難道甘願作魚兒嗎？</p>
<h3>海中最狠的動物</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>錿地球上最大的動物，當然首推鯨魚了。鯨魚的身長，有達三十米突的，可是碩大無朋的鯨，一旦爲鯱所襲，那就沒有用的。鯱鳥海豚之一種，其上下兩顎，銳利的齒，常把鯨魚的身體，咬得粉骨碎身而死的。這鯱在海中性好聯合同類，成羣結隊專去害鯨，所以鯨魚一見了鯱，往往拚命逃遁，誤泳到海灘邊，被漁夫所捕的。</p>
<p>鱏鱏魚的尾巴，好像鋸齒形的刺棘，尾尖放射極毒的毒液，濺到這毒液，就要致命的，漁夫捕到鱏魚時，先得斬絶尾巴，防爲所害。鱏魚旣然有這毒液防敵文具有鋸齒形的刺棘，可是碰到鱶魚或鮫魚，就難敵了。因爲鱶與鮫的利齒，能把那鋸齒形的尾巴，嚼得粉碎，這就是强中還有强敵，誰也不能驕傲自大哇。</p>
<p>食船蟲比鯱鱏鱶鮫還要厲害，形體很小，而能够把大船毁損的，呌做船食蟲，蟲身包有石灰質的貝殻，這種害蟲，不論船體爲木與鐵，倘若爲它黏住，那就漸漸的能把船體鑽成像蜂窠樣的洞，因此世界的造船業者研究出防除的方法，用鐵皮包裝船身外，再塗以防蟲藥　　籐螺爲圓錐形的貝類，這籐螺在海中常附着軍艦周圍，使船的速力減退，因爲船底周圍，受數十噸的籐螺層層疊疊的貝殼黏住，船的行駛，遂不自由了。雖造船家用有毒的油搽上船體，但是幼稚的籐螺，消化器還沒有發育，無論什麽毒油，也不會感染的。</p>
<h3>農村小友的通問送春</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>春是怱怱地降臨，現在却偸偸地去了。它的來，曾將我們的大地，裝璜得非常璀璨，富麗；我們感激它，歡迎它。現在它去了，我們就這樣不聲不響地讓它去嗎？未免太寂寞吧？那麽，旣有歡迎在先，當有歡送在後；才不辜負它建設自然的一番苦心。</p>
<p>我們怎樣表示呢？詩人墨客，把酒揮筆以送；我們是志氣豪達，向上進取的人，不客消極做無聊的勾當。前次信中，曾說到「靑春象徴着兒童」：我們在這一點上未免惋惜！眼看春來了，老了，去了。我們的送春，只有一顆熱烈的童心，蘊藏着「送」的深意在。當這時，惟一的跟着時光，找尋我們將來的康莊大道。</p>
<p>春去了，嬌艷的杏花，鮮美的桃花，早被它帶去了。杜鵑爲着哭了，凄厲的聲音，直穿一透般遊子的心坎。雷公也放起大砲，表示歡送呢？還是憤怒呢？朋友們！能知道，不？</p>
<p>朋友！留不住的「春」去了！記着！</p>
<h3>小噴泉</h3>
<p>— 百宜</p>
<p>這是一個很好玩而又簡便的科學遊戲：</p>
<p>製法：先將一中號玻璃瓶中約盛四分之三的淸水，然後塞上一個挿有空心玻璃管的軟木塞務使管的一端近瓶底；塞緊，最好用火漆封固，再取更大之玻璃瓶一，放在燭火上烘三四分鐘後，罩在小玻璃瓶上。不久，我們便可看見水漸漸由管内上升而噴射出來。</p>
<p>理由：大玻璃瓶在火上烘後，裏面的空氣便由熱而膨脹，於是一部分便逃出瓶外，大瓶罩在小瓶上後因壓力較小，所以小瓶内的空氣便衝了出來，小瓶内</p>
<p>因上面的壓力减小於是也噴了出來，因爲水原是有種向上壓的力。</p>
<p>我們玩這個遊戲的時候最好在小瓶的底下舖幾張吸水紙因爲這樣一來可以免得噴出來的水向四面流開，二來可使外面的空氣不侵入大瓶内。</p>

<p>卡爾生來勢凶猛卡爾生首先發球、發球者皆勝卡爾生以三比　佔先時、第六局許發球、卡上網攔殺、在凶猛之壓迫下、許之發球局爲之擊破、成四比二、卡繼續其壓殺攔網、向許之各方進攻、進至五比二、許雖追上二局卒以四比六失敗、</p>
<p>許承基努力反攻卡爾生在第一盤中、極盡精彩之至有若干意想不到之表演、惟第　盤奮戰過烈、第三盤不無倦疲、許則不慌不亂、沈着應付、遂以三比　、四比一、五比　、佔先、第九局許只須再得一分、卽可勝此盤時、竟爲卡爾生之壓殺所破、成五比四之險局、幸許力自振作、以六比四奪回第　盤、</p>

<p>鄭兆佳六比三九比七王文正</p>
<h3>雙打戰未分勝負</h3>
<p>第一盤潘卡佔先潘卡前以敗於林許、此次交戰、大抱復仇之志、惟林許上塲連勝三局得來殊易第四局後、潘氏怒氣冲天、取巧奪回造成四四平局老林小許不肯示弱、搭配適當以五四局面、勝利在握、旋被卡氏發球以直落四又成平局、且以六五、七六幾乎失利、小許拚命趕上、以九比八佔先、最後三周、潘卡一氣呼成座以十一對九得第一盤</p>
<p>第二盤林許爭回林許失守後繼續努力、尤以小許奔馳得力、抽壓有勁、表演精采、首以三對一佔先、繼被潘卡奪回二局、小許得發球機會、以直落四勝第七局、老林久久不甚得手、乃更換網拍、果然有效、以七比五爭回第二盤至此已暮色蒼茫、將近七時、遂由裁判員宣造終止比賽、</p>

<h3>一個女敎師的希望</h3>
<p>— 式言</p>
<p>今日的兒童，是國家將來的主人翁，是中華民族復興運動中負有最重要使命的人，這些負有重大使命的國家主人翁，其幸運的一部，現在正在校裏受着德智體育的薰陶，凖備其强健的體魄，高尙的人格，生産的知能，將來民族的興亡，要視現在學校敎育之效率如何而定。增高學校敎育的先决條件，是優美的學校環境，充足的經費，適宜的敎材，良好的敎師，前三者是死的，只有敎師是活的，所以環境的改造，經費的分配，敎材的選擇，都要靠活敎師來擔任的，這樣看來，敎師所負的責任是何等重大啊！</p>
<p>至於敎師目前的生活怎樣？我們且來看一看敎育事業最發達的上海罷。其餘就可想而知了，據敎局調查結果，上海小學敎師的生活費，三分之二爲六十元以上，和部定待遇標凖相差很遠，因而見異思遷的，比比皆是：每日工作時間往往超過十二小時（課内外合計），以致健康受其障碍，工作效率受其影響，尤其是女敎師因充兒養老等家務的牽累，月經的困難，姙娠期中生理的異常，産前産後的缺乏休息，疾病及死亡率更大：因薪金的低徴，工作之繁重，進修問題，簡直談不到。</p>
<p>總上以觀，敎師的責任，旣這等重大，所以我希望於敎師們的是：（一）高尙人格的修養，（二）强健體格的鍜鍊，（三）高深學問的研討。敎師的生活，旣如此困難，所以我希望於當局的是：（一）增加薪俸，不欠薪，（二）减少工作，（三）規定工作與休息時間，（四）限定學生人數，（五）養老金，（六）衛生局爲敎師診治檢查，不取醫藥費，（七）舟車免票，（八）購書打折（九）入大學或研究院及其他學術機關聽講，一律免費免考，（十）派遣國内外考察敎育，（十一）敎師托兒所，（十二）産前産後的休養，（十三）經期休息·（十四）敎師增位的何障·（十五）敎費獨立。</p>
<p>這樣，敎師才有專業的精神，才有機會努力進修，才有全付精神從事實騐，這樣，不但是敎師本身福利，也就兒童的福利，國家民族的福利。書於二十三年敎師節</p>
<h3>孩子們的母親</h3>
<p>— 先</p>
<p>她醒了，從迷夢中醒來。月色凄凉地照着她，照着掛在墻上圓圓和寗哥兒的照睛丨孩子們痴痴地望着她，似乎想哭的樣子。</p>
<p>湘睡在她的身旁，把被踢開了：嘴裏說着夢話。她坐起來輕輕地拿着被替湘蓋上了；又躺下去，嘆了一聲：「唉，美的夢呢？」</p>
<p>記起從前：湘進幼稚園的時候，寗哥兒總是哭着閙着要跟他姐姐一塊兒去。那時湘已經四歲；寗哥兒才兩歲；圓圓是剛剛生下來兩個月。每天，她要喂圓圓的奶：給孩子們做美麗的衣服，做好吃的萊；替孩子們洗澡······忙，沒有時間想到自己的安適和康健。身體漸漸衰弱，常常是頭痛，腰痛。但是爲了孩子們她不悲傷。她有一個希望，希望着一個美麗而快樂的家庭。</p>
<p>孩子是太可愛了：那一次，湘的學校開「母親會」，她帶着寗哥兒去赴會。湘表演「小白兎」和「樹上的小雀子」。戴着兎兒的帽子，背着兎兒的皮；戴着雀兒的　子又閃着雀兒的翹子。她沒有料想到四歲的湘會聽着鋼琴的節調，按着表演的秩序，踏着音樂的拍子：活潑天眞地在台上表演！後來給奬品的時候，湘的先生拿一個小皮球給湘，湘有些不好意思去接而遲延着；寗哥兒就從他的來賓席上站起來，走過去接着了。大家都快樂地笑起來：她更是多麽歡喜？</p>
<p>湘會唱好幾隻歌；寗哥兒也會唱時新的黨歌和毛毛雨；圓圓也會笑了。她呢，還在整天做着美麗的夢；夢想着一個完美的家庭，有孩子，有愛。這夢，彷彿在她的孩子們的歌聲，笑聲裏告訴了她：一定會實現的。</p>
<p>夢是會實現的嗎？</p>
<p>一個黃昏的傍晚，太陽落到竹林後面的時候，她被世界上的一個男人送到江邊。山是遠遠的站着；水是長長地流着；她的夢，像飛去了的鳥，沒有了踪跡！</p>
<p>從此，她抱着三個孩子回到了不能諒解她的父母底家裏。父親不愛一個「現代的靑年」的他，也就不愛一個不能做「賢妻良母」的女兒。她的繼母又只知道「新派」「舊派」來熱譏冷嘲，更沒有一點同情於她！爲了孩子們與自己的未來生活，他想找「工作」；但她不知道從何處入門？她想靠着舊日的同學找一個小學敎員的位置；而同學們又恐怕她帶着許多孩子，分不了多少精神敎育。因此，誰也不肯負介紹的責任。後來她的老師邀他到鄕村女師去當訓育主任。爲了不忍使幼小的孩子丨未曾離開她提携的孩子丨離開她，她只好帶着孩子們住在學校裏。但是無知的學生們因此攻擊她，恥笑她；同事們也會覺得學校裏有孩子是有傷大雅的事；於是校長便要她到外面去租房子住。而學校裏的訓育人員又必需長駐在學校裏；她就逼着不得不離開她一刻也不忍離開的孩子！</p>
<p>她沒有作事的經騐。她所懂得的「人事」太少了。她不知「出風頭」；「玩花樣」；怎樣聯絡同事們替自己宣傳，被學生擁護。她只知道以坦白。熱烈的心情，去養成敦厚純樸的人性。她對人，對事，都是秉着她那眞誠渾厚的天性。因此，她到處受人們的攻擊，陷害，侮辱。社會上甚至於猜疑她是曾經受過男子的騙，做過極不名譽的，下流的姨太。</p>
<p>她帶着孩子們到處謀生活；一遇到失業，就帶着孩子們回到父母底家裏去。繼母責駡她底脾氣太壞，到處做不長久。她只好忍受着。不幸那一年她的家鄕遇着幾次的兵匪；加之農村的崩潰，商業的不景氣，父母家裏的生活也一般地降落下來。就是她的父親，有時想着她們娘兒們將來的生活，也不免有隱微的嘆息！</p>
<p>這時，湘又生起利害的傷寒病來。熱度高到已經糊言亂語。全身的骨骼就像要拆斷一般地痛，使她連抱都不敢去抱她。有什麽辦法呢，住在鄕下，沒有錢，生這樣的病，只好看看死人！她知道自己沒有能力救孩子了，便把病孩子糊糊塗塗地完全讓家裏的人去處置。幸喜機會凑巧，孩子的病已經在不可救藥的光景，竟給一個只看些醫書，絶無醫學經騐的她的姑母，用十五個銅元的藥救活了！</p>
<p>她受的刺激太多太大了；她開始忿恨着這殘酷的人世。她恨世界爲什麽生了她！她咀咒世界爲什麽不毁滅她！但是生活的鎖練緊緊地繫住她，使她沒有時間忿恨，咀咒。她不能再想那過去的種種；她更不敢想到那未來的一切。爲了孩子未來的安全和幸福，她知道她不得不暫時忍着心抛開孩子：否則她知孩子都會同歸於盡。於是她在一天雨雪霏霏的淸晨，逃出了她的父母底家；抛棄了她的兒女們；帶着身邊惟一的行旅丨一顆悲痛而奮勇的心丨遠遠地跑到和她家鄕反方向的北平。她要盡她的力量去救她的孩子！但她仍做着美麗的，薔藢色的夢丨一個美麗的家庭，有孩子，有花，有愛······</p>
<p>在北平流浪了整整三年·她還有勇氣再想一想這三年的流浪生活嗎？薔薇色的美麗的夢，像鳥一般地飛去，永遠尋不着踪跡了！</p>
<p>九一八的砲聲，驚醒了她的迷夢！她知道了；在帝國主義爪牙之下，一切都是處在黑暗的地獄裏的；她的美麗的，薔薇的夢如何可以實現呢？被壓迫者整個兒得不着安樂的生活。她也不會例外。美麗的夢還會實現嗎？</p>

<h3>徬徨</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>早上，孫三嫂興怱怱地搭着二姑的胳臂跑上往城裏開的板蓬船，粗大的髮髻中央透着半寸長的根把，桃紅的顔色和兩個女人的心一樣活躍。</p>
<p>雖然，在活躍裏是攙着野火焚燒一樣的焦灼。</p>
<p>二姑是老進城的人了，但這回還是拉不開笑臉地那麽不舒泰，惴惴地瞪着平靜的河面。心裏却「找着個事情作啊！」那麽地念着。</p>
<p>挨着她木鷄似的坐着，孫三嫂却更不安着，頭一次上城呀，如果有了着落便要在城裏住久了。</p>
<p>「也許今年以是一個豐年呀，比去年收成還好也說不定的，田地空着不種······」孫三嫂望着沿岸的綠綠的田樹，覺得風雨的調和，便又不自禁地念到將棄去的農事而憐惜起來。人習慣了那一類生活往往便有一點依戀它，何况對於那本來的以是茫無把握的。</p>
<p>二姑睜着老練的眸子：</p>
<p>「虧你還捨不下，你一定要到餓死了還死心眼嗎？去年不是大豐年，咱們？算下等的田地也還糶了不够還租，到頭來自己却吃一半借一半，我是看開了。」</p>
<p>孫三嫂緊皺着眉頭，心想究竟是二姑多見識</p>
<p>，說出來的話有門路；但又想二姑的男人本就在城裏作零活，田忙回來，否則就在城裏住，這回抛下田往城裏走不算一回事，但自己却是要把沒有爸爸的孩子託給公婆，獨自個往堅苦的道上爬的人。想着想着眼睛裏要掛水，忙又止住。</p>
<p>船裏的人全是和她們半斤八兩，每人掛着一副嚴肅的臉蛋，每人計算着自己的上城去的事務，有熟人便柴米油鹽地聊起來，多少夾着七分喟嘆。對這家鄕，像對破廟一樣躊躇，不知怎樣去修補，或是爽性毁了它。</p>
<p>汽船嘟嘟地趕過板蓬船，一隻又是一隻，那裏面坐着鄕鎭上的「上流人物」，或是「半上流人物。」</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>孫三嫂和二姑在大街小巷中穿巡，二姑揀凡是有一點熟識的薦頭店都跑遍了，可是却找不到一個能停留的去處，每一家都坐滿了兩行待雇的人，男的和女的。有的在轉換中，有的也全是乍從鄕間來，大家抛下榨不出油來的村鎭跑來找飯碗，於是破例，在這開始下秧的時期却坐滿了待雇的人，鄕下人像趕果園的蜜蜂一樣地逃到城裏來，然而城子像骷髏般乾枯。</p>
<p>「留點神吧，費心的，我們能做，苦慣了·········」</p>
<p>薦頭店主抺着汗：</p>
<p>「初從鄕下來的更不吃香啦，人這麽多，住都住不下，趁早趕晚班船回去吧！」、、</p>
<p>「只一宵不可以嗎？實在種不得田的了才出來。」懷着不可能的希望，兩個女人挾着布包在街上尋找着薦頭店的招牌，心裏是又苦又酸的。</p>
<p>碼頭上，聚着往各處奔走的旅客，各種式樣的船隻在河心列着陣勢。踏上跳板，孫三嫂和二姑顚抖着腿邁過去，夾在那麽多的同命運的人羣裏。</p>
<h3>孩子們與日光浴</h3>
<p>— 耿龍根</p>
<p>當然母親們希望她們的孩子的身體强壯，在一般中國母親們的心裏，以爲使孩子的身體强壯的方法，是多喝乳與多吃東西，喝乳與吃東西果然於孩子的身體有益，但吃喝得太多，反於孩子的身體有害。</p>
<p>現在我來介紹一種可强壯孩子身體的最好的方法丨日光浴。</p>
<p>日光，在很早的時候，就被人知道是一種與人有益的東西。但是中國的母親們，大槪是不願他們的孩子晒到日光，以致皮膚發黑，將喪失白皮膚的漂亮。</p>
<p>由近代科學的研究，知日光之中，一部份發生光，一部份發生熱。這些光與熱在人的生命上，皆有極大的需要，同時因其能醫治及防止肺癆病及小孩軟骨病等。故可使孩子的身體强壯與康健。</p>
<p>日光旣是這樣於人有益，且不必需要金錢去買，無論何處，都可以得到，同時日光浴，也不需要何種器械，所以用日光來强壯孩子的身體，實較其他種種方法爲經濟，而他的効力却較其他方法爲大。　　日光由雨點中反射出七色丨紅，橙黃，黃，綠，藍，靑，及紫丨的虹，日光經過三稜鏡，也反射出與虹同樣的七色。其一邊的紅色，是日光中的熱線。另一邊的紫色，却是光線，但在兩邊，尙有爲我等所不能看見的線，在紅色一邊者，呌做紅内線：發生極大熱。在紫色一邊者，呌做紫外線；此線非但發生光，並含有多量足以使人身體强壯及幫助生長的特質。</p>
<p>日光經過固體，光線每被濾出。日光經過玻璃等透明體，勢線與光綫都能够進去：但紫外綫却不能透過。所以在晒日光時，必須使日光能直接晒到皮膚上面，方才可以得到紫外錢中的効力。</p>
<p>紫外線能使人得强硬的骨格與健康的肌肉；並能帮助生長與營養，當此種線與日光中的熱線混合後，卽在皮膚上形成一種黑褐色的色素；日光經過這種色素，紫外線可充分地走進身體内部。</p>
<p>此種線尙有滅殺徴菌，抵抗傳染病，醫治及防止肺勞病及小孩軟骨病等之効力。</p>
<p>日光浴的地點熱天最好在戶外，冷天則在戶内，在冷天應該對着開着的窗，其他門窗，皆應關閉，以防通風；惟在極冷天氣，不免發生困難，據聞現在有種特製的玻璃，可使紫外線透入。</p>
<p>日光浴的時間，亦應隨氣候之冷熱而定，冷天應在中午，熱天應在早晚，否則太冷太熱，反將發生疾病，時間的多少，亦應有規定，孩子們日光浴，最好使與刷口洗身一樣地養成一種習慣，還有日光浴時，最好使孩子同時遊戲與運動。</p>
<p>日光比任何補品有價値，希望有孩子的母親們注意。</p>
<h3>前進</h3>
<p>— 諒</p>
<p>環顧我的周遭，</p>
<p>天色是這樣的凄淸，</p>
<p>空氣是這樣的冷靜，</p>

<p>聽說那邊，</p>
<p>春已來臨，</p>
<p>薔薇的途徑，</p>
<p>滿佈着蓓蕾的芳芬，</p>
<p>這確是個可愛的環境。</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>正待出發前行，</p>
<p>祗見前面橫着一條滿載荆棘的途徑；</p>
<p>縱目望去，</p>
<p>一道鴻溝，</p>
<p>中間碧血盈盈，</p>
<p>一帶壁壘，</p>
<p>旁邊白骨磷：</p>
<p>這顯然是前驅者的犧牲，怎不令我膽怯心驚！</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>正在這樣的徬徨，</p>
<p>這樣的逡巡，</p>
<p>騫地一股熱血，</p>
<p>湧上我的心靈，</p>
<p>把我的命運，</p>
<p>看得分明：</p>
<p>退回吧，</p>
<p>與衆消沉，</p>
<p>站着吧，</p>
<p>膏豺狼的吻，</p>
<p>祇有前進，</p>
<p>方有到達的可能。</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>前進！前進！</p>
<p>我已凖備把熱血來拼，</p>
<p>萬一蹈一前人的足印，</p>
<p>終較不進退的，</p>
<p>來得光榮，</p>
<p>何况我的靈魂，</p>
<p>已與這幸福的樂園接近</p>
<h3>回鄕</h3>
<p>— 令莫</p>
<p>記得初次回到家鄕的時候，正是廢歷的二月中旬，離着淸明很近，那時廣東的天氣已經一天一天的暖起來，人們都穿着淡淡顔色的單薄衣服，飄飄然很瀟洒的早就享受那可受的春光了·我回去的目的，一是爲着我的一點私事，二是我在外埠長大的，未曾見過家裏的族人；并且父親要我趁這淸明節的機會，到我們沒有見過的祖父母的基前拜掃，算是代表他盡一點孝心·因爲他爲着生活問題，在外飄流了三十多年總沒有時候讓他回去看看，雖然終日都在懷念着，夢想着·</p>
<p>我家是一個中落的書香世家，祖上遺下好幾十畝田，幾個農塲，還有一間信用卓著，根基很穩的錢莊，可是子孩們專靠着這些産業生活，不做什麽事情，有些閒閒蕩蕩，所謂麻雀呀，牌九呀，番攤呀，便是他們的日常生活·有些抽上大煙，躺在床上，拿着煙管，整日的呑雲吐霧，不知道什麽呌着九一八，什麽呌着一二八·家裏沒有柴米了便說：</p>
<p>「到錢莊上支去，算我的賬」。</p>
<p>一天天的過去了·終於在這個不景氣的年頭破産了，錢莊倒閉，欠了十多萬銀的債·田契呢，押的押，賣的賣，所餘無幾了·</p>
<p>他們雖然眼見着祖上的産業漸漸兒的賣掉，用掉，可是對於這個淸明節，仍然不肯稍事節儉，好像寧願看見活着的子孫受餓，不願沒有幾隻很體面的燒猪，槓到山上祭這些已死的先人，不單是燒猪一樣，選要酒菜，餅食和水菓·掃基禮節行過了，便將這些東西搬到祠堂裏，按着各房子孫人數分派，酒菜呢！留到當晚邀請些親戚朋友，在祠堂裏大飲大吃起來，其實他們并非誠心要這麽多的祭物擺在祖先的基前；不過這班當事者要趁這機會向公欵上撈些油水，坐食的呢，樂得不用化錢，肥肥他們的嘴吧，還要領到一份什麽胙金，他們！男子們一高興極了·至於我們女子呢？難道不是這家祖宗的子孩嗎？我們簡直一點東西都沒有份兒；還要給他們嘲笑！輕視！</p>
<p>我看見他們這樣的待對我們女子，老是不高興，扳着面孔站在一邊看他們分派東西·我的叔祖見我站着不動，他隨手拿了一份胙金給我，并且微微笑的說：</p>
<p>「這是你父親的一份，你代他收了罷」·</p>
<p>剛巧我們的姑媽站在旁邊，瞧見這些，她嘆了一口氣對我說：</p>
<p>「你爲什麽不是一個男孩子！唉·你又沒有兄弟，不是的話，你今天倒要多拿幾份也說不定呢」？她說了又嘆一口氣；好像很替她已故的父親擔心似的：因爲我們的父親丨丨她的弟弟丨丨是我們祖父的長子·她們傳統的思想是：祗有長子是承繼這房的香火，别一個是不行的，所以長子們必定要一個長孫長媳這麽一代代的傳下去，可巧，我們父親，養的全是女兒，沒有一個合得他們的口胃，所以她們，各兄弟姊妹們，很替她們的這一房焦急，說是要我們父親非趕快的娶妾，養一個兒子出來不可·當時我收了這錢，聽着這些話，滿腹的不舒服，瞧了我姑媽一眼便一直跑回家裏來了·</p>
<p>終於在一個早晨，我和她們作哵，離開我的家鄕·</p>

<h3>性愛生活之將來</h3>
<p>— 芸</p>
<p>我們無論從那一方面說來在現在社會制度之下，人類的性愛生活，正如交易所中的商品一樣，一方面是僅一小部份人在享受着性愛生活的幸福，而另一方面却有大量的人羣在畸形的性愛生活中苦痛掙扎。有些人因爲沒有養活妻子的經濟力量，於是不能不拿錢到人肉市塲上去賣不健全的性愛生活。有些人則因環境的逼迫，不能不出賣自己的肉體以維持生活。同時還有大量的人，或是不能得到滿意的配偶，甚至不得已要抱着「永久」的獨身！</p>
<p>因此，我們從過去以至於現在，從歷史演進的過程上看來，男女兩性間之性愛生活的記錄，到現在正在書寫着異常悲慘的一頁。在這一頁裏正不知葬送了多少的靑春，多少的智慧，和多少的生命！</p>
<p>然而，歷史的車輪决不會永遠停留在某一階段，歷史的前進也必然會毁滅人類這種不健全的性愛生活。在將來，在那全世界的科學和生産技術已發達到了一個最高階段，社會的一切財富完全歸人類自己支配的時候，那時，兩性間的性愛生活當然會脫離「商品化」的覊絆而走入正軌，人們除了每日作很短的必要勞働工作而外，他們可以用很多的時間來研究科學，藝術，以及各種專門知識，以提高人類的知識水平。同時，還有充分的機會作各種鍜鍊身體的運動和遊戲，以及注意一切有益於身體的衛生。此外，還有許多餘裕的時間可以用在各種享樂方面（如音樂，跳舞，電影，戲劇，文學···）在這種條件之下，　女間的關係，性愛的生活，不但不受一切法律，宗敎，道德，禮敎的束縛，金錢的限制，而且是純粹以男女雙方的愛情爲基礎的。其次如思想志趣的相投，嗜好藝術的同感，體格，儀表，性情······的相調和，也是達到圓滿戀愛的附帶條件。至於兩性的衛生和性的一切知識，那時一定有專門醫院和衛生機關來負責任，檢查男女的身體，使患花柳，淋症，肺病以及患其他傳染病者，一律禁止其結婚，以免貽害他人及種族。並且，結婚離婚之絶對自由，以及正當的性生活知識之普遍，將使人類的性愛生活更趨於健全和美滿！</p>
<p>這當然不僅只是一個理想，而且他是一個必然的事實，不過，我們知道：這種事實之實現，决不只是一個「宿命的」必然，主要的還需要我們之艱苦的偉大的努力丨因爲這决不是一個簡單的問題，這是整個的社會問題中之一部門，我們要求這一問題之解决，主要的當然需要整個社會的改良。</p>

<h3>紗花　紗花恢復平和常態</h3>

<h3>美新棉作頗多可慮消息</h3>
<p>紐約六月八日電告一週棉市狀况云、棉帶東部陰雨繼續、而麥帶旱災亦有、或將延至西南之虞、由此而起棉作前途之惶慮、已引起原棉市塲之投機需求、出售者較少、市價乃漲起、七月期市價漲至一角二分時、套賣增多、復有一角借欵的棉花、現從内地逐漸運出之消息、惟通貨膨脹之說復作、而氣候不利之報告、亦繼續傳來、故市價稍跌時之套賣、與多方了結、皆被賣方吸收、東部屢來棉田多草與棉梗多水之陳訴、形勢尙未尖銳化、但台克蕯斯與鄂克賀默兩州現需甘霖、惟東部如再陰雨綿延、則將釀成重大虫害之恐慌、且多水之棉莖、遇乾燥而熱之氣候、亦將迅速變劣也、目前鋼業工潮可慮、此事則限制棉市買風、</p>
<h3>小投機商售出美棉</h3>

<h3>糧食　現粉喊高期貨提漲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈平穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好一二角左右、坎拿大好二三角左右、故開盤後、各月份市面、曾見俏利、兼之各廠觀望不出、業外多頭、則仍吸進、較之前日、曾又漲一分左右、旋則多頭回出、略見回落、迨至下午開盤、初尙安靜、後傳福新廠現貨、喊高二分、因此本月份市面、卽　　提漲、遠期因此亦愈開愈緊、大小廠家、又一致擯住不出、所回以各月份局面均見良好、至津帮方面、則仍出、結果本月份較漲二分半、七月份漲一分半、八月份漲二分、九月份漲二分二厘半、十月份漲二分半、十一月份漲二分云、</p>
<h3>麥市近好遠低</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈近好遠平之象、本月份因籌碼不多、内地套貨尙未凖備、浮空一經抵補、市面卽見回好四五分、以後則未做開、遠期以買戶見稀、套售者尙暢、市呈平定、迨至下午開盤、交易未見暢旺、買戶又寂寞不前、故各盤市面、稍見軟弱、結果八月份跌一分、九月份跌三分、十月份跌二分、餘無出入、現麥尙見活洛、陳貨市面穩站、新貨平定、開采石磯新麥二元八角、二百四十包、歸德陳麥三元一角七分、次一角半、頴州麥三元一角、次三元零五分、黃橋麥三元零七分、計二千七百包由福新辦去云、</p>
<h3>晚稻無甚上落</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源二十餘號（三千五百餘石）、去路亦稍懈、故到源雖稀、形勢未見緊色、北洋帮包胃、先後共進靑角松泗練塘等晚稻一千五六百包、厚粳三四百包、晚稻行情無上落、厚粳以店胃有限、市色難立、因售方極力堅持、僅宿次者略軟數分新鮮者猶能站定、杜洋尖供求相仿、陰變元略定、</p>

<h3>國際聯盟的崩潰</h3>
<p>— 雲從君來稿</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰的結果，除了犧牲成千成萬的生命，銷耗了數十百兆的金錢而外，唯一的成績就是成立了一個促進世界和平的機關丨丨丨國際聯盟。</p>
<p>當一九二零年一月十日凡爾賽條約發生效力，國際聯盟正式成立的時候，全世界的政治家和那受戰爭苦難的人民，都歡聲載道的在慶祝這一世界和平機關的確立，大家都以爲世界從此太平無事，而國際和平已經有了深切的保障了。</p>
<p>殊不知，在現在，時間才過了十多年，而一切的客觀事件，却已證明當時人們理想的錯誤乃。儘管日内瓦還在高奏着和平的音樂，但是我們現在所聽見的却是戰神的獰笑。軍縮會議的失敗，列强瘋狂的軍備競爭，英美在世界市塲的爭覇，日美在太平洋的衝突，德法矛盾的加緊，以及日俄在遠東的備戰，這一切都足以證明：在整個的世界，現在正如第一次世界大戰的前夜一樣，各處都彌漫了戰爭的空氣。現在，除了三歲的小孩而外，無論誰恐怕都絶不會懷疑到二次世界大戰之必然的爆發罷！</p>
<p>在這種大戰的危機之前，國聯已經喪失了牠底効能，一切正義，公理與和平的試金石已經證明國聯只是一個腐朽的僵屍。在過去，國聯雖是列强的一個××組織，但牠有時究竟也可用來緩和他們彼此間的衝突，或用來粉飾世界的和平。可是，到現在，在目前世界帝國主義自身衝突的加速發展中，這個粉飾和平的機關也不能不日趨崩潰了。</p>
<p>首先是日本撕毁國際公約，佔領了我國東三省，並且正式退出國聯。接着便是德國對軍縮問題的不滿，於去年十月十四日正式宣佈脫離。現在，國聯雖然勉强存在，但是，美俄日德等主要國家都未參加，國聯本身的作用也就大形削弱。万其是最近軍縮會議丨丨國聯之唯一工作丨丨又宣佈了破産，國聯的工作已遭受了最後的試騐。</p>
<p>不僅如此，就在目前破碎的國際聯盟之中，各帝國主義都還在以此爲中心而互相鬥爭。</p>
<p>意大利爲要在歐州奪取法國的覇權，一方面成立了意奥匈聯盟，同時又在高唱國聯的改組，牠企圖借此把國聯抓在自己的手裏，以减弱法國在歐州的勢力。</p>
<p>美國過去一貫表示出對國聯的問題不過問，但是，近年來美國金元勢力地歐州的發展却不能不使牠熱烈的干涉歐州的一切政治問題。美國在歐州不僅和英國競爭，同時也要和法國競爭，美國總是時刻不忘的在破壞歐州反美的聯合戰綫。因此，美國對於國際聯盟不但不願維持，反而在各方面要促進牠的崩潰。</p>
<p>要維持國聯的，只有法國和英國。最近，英法爲要維持國聯的存在，竭力企圖拉攏蘇聯的加入。在蘇聯方面，以後也許爲了鞏固目前的法俄聯盟，爲對付法西斯的德國而參加國聯，也許因爲蘇聯不願參加歐州政治的漩渦而終目加入也不可知。不過，在目前情形之下，國聯已在破碎迷離的狀態，以後卽使蘇聯加入，但對於國聯本身的危機也還是無法挽救的！</p>
<p>大這種情形之下，我們可以看見國聯的命運已經走到最後破産的階段了。世界是一個强力的炸藥庫，國聯的破産正是說明第一次大戰到第二次大戰間之和平時期已經完結，第二次世界大戰的砲聲將成爲國聯之最後的葬禮！</p>
<p>處在這世界戰塲上的四萬萬同胞，我們將如保去應付未來的一切事變呢？國聯已經崩潰了，難道我們還要去依賴國聯嗎？</p>

<h3>蝗蟲</h3>
<p>— 思于</p>
<p>夏的農村，在濃鬰的空氣下沉寂着。忙過了一季蠶塲的婦女們，拖着疲倦的身子，在堂戶裏收拾着一切養蠶時用的器具，與從繭行裏賣剩下來的　皮繭子。男人們都荷着犁鋤，趕着水牛，捧着一顆今年繭子又不値錢的失望之心，往田裏去了，把滿肚皮的不樂意，寄放在鋤口與犁尖上，重重地翻耕着田土，希望，希望豐盛的秋收來解救生活的壓迫。夏的農村，在濃鬰的空氣下沉寂着，很少在村莊上走動的脚步聲，連黃狗也在柳蔭下或竹籬畔打着盹。</p>
<p>四月無閒人的上興村，只有村長六公公年高輩長地有福份到鎭上去坐坐茶館，喝碗茶，聽些實際上已經陳舊了的新聞紙上的消息回來，在晚鴉聲</p>
<p>中，趁農人們多洗脚洗乎，捧着碗聚在空塲上吃晚飯時，講山海經一樣的講給大家聽聽。質樸的聽衆們在聽得好笑時會把滿嘴的飯粒噴在地上，又后悔地可惜地灣下身去檢起來吹吹灰塵再往嘴裏送，聽得憤慨時就跥着脚踝「海裏駡知縣」地駡上一套。只有在聽說又要加捐或者催繳錢糧時，各人懷着器笑不得的心情散回去，找着老婆或者小孩的错處來打駡着藉此出氣。</p>
<p>今天，樣子有點不同了，因各人忙着工作而沉靜的上興村，在村長六公公從鎭上怱促地早回後騷動起來了。在村西锄田的桂生父子首先看見六公公對着每一坵迎風點頭的麥田作揖，嘴裏還喃喃地念着什麽。桂生父子有點不敢間他地只是停下鋤子來看着，六公公命令他倆快些呌所有的男子漢荷着鋤子回家後，龍鍾地奔往村莊去了。</p>
<p>當男人們莫名其妙地回到村上時，看見六公公正在村東的猛將廟前燒着點燭，就明白了一半，意識地忙亂了脚步奔過來，問六公公是不是蝗蟲來了。</p>
<p>「蝗蟲，天，天蟲來了！從×縣飛過來，在鎭西開了口，麥穗，秧芽，全給吃了·天意，快求菩蕯！」一大半男子跟着六公公跪下了，只有少數年靑後生猶疑着。</p>
<p>婦女們也都從堂屋裏跑了出來，離開猛將廟不遠地站着，看看這小小的廟，廟前跪着自己的丈夫或者兒子，憂鬰地又回過頭去看看西方的天空。小孩們駭怕地躱在祖母或母親的身邊，等待着一件大小幸事的到來。</p>
<p>終於在一柱香不曾燒到半節的當兒，先是婦女們的呌喊，呌起了跪着的男人們低下的頭。成羣的蝗蟲雪片似地從西面天空中飛舞過來，落在塲上，田裏，跳，兇猛地四處亂跳開去。大禍降臨了，婦女們天呀菩薩地哭着，小孩子跟着亂號。急白了臉的男人們，拿了可以敲打得響的鐵器銅鑼往田裏奔，首先跑到麥田和身田邊，只見滿埂滿畦都是蝗蟲，可是還不曾用牠們利剪般的嘴來咬麥穗，只疲倦地像在養神。一菩薩保佑，猛將封了蟲嘴，不開口，救我們這一方人的話命！」各人心裏這麽想着。把神的權力擴大到最高度。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>六公公在猛將廟前長跪着，許願：「不開口，我們這一方請班子唱戲謝神，開光！」還沒說完，四野裏，附近各村莊，銅鑼聲，鐵器響，人哭，呌喊，天塌下來地響開了，蝗蟲在空中驟雨樣的飛，在麥田裏蠶吃桑葉似的咬着，頃刻闖，半人高的麥子有的斷了根莖倒下，有的折了穗子掛着。才三寸多高的嫩秧，被嚙啃得留點根兒，完了！</p>
<p>六公公的許願求神，沒禁得住蝗蟲的口，各人敲打的銅鑼鐵器，沒骇趕得走蝗羣。只</p>
<p>桂生父子倆用掃帚跟蝗蟲搏鬥，打死半溝蝗蟲，保全一畝多的秧田。可是在「蝗蝻到處不留靑」的蝗禍中，這僅存的秧田能否保全尙不可知呢。</p>
<p>從此，上興和週圍的各個村子，淪入死神襲擊後的狀態中，這種狀態的區域隨着蝗蟲的紛飛與亂跳延開去。</p>
<h3>减低房租問題</h3>
<p>— 吉崇</p>
<p>在表面上似已消沈的减租運動，因爲市參議會之召集運動中的關係者雙方談話，房産公會與减租促成會之發表具體的意見，與夫市商會之具呈市府請擬减租辦法，又復引起了一般人之注意。個人因覺這問題的重要，故特在此供獻一點意見於一般讀者之前，希望由此可以更加引起大家對於問題之重視，並進而設法解决這一問題。</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>最近六七年來，因爲農村經濟的崩潰，各地工商業的衰落，便積成了大量的現金不住地由内地流入上海來的現象。據統計，最近幾年由農村流入上海來的現金就有五，六萬萬元之多。但是，近年來上海的工商業也在凋敝中，大家都不願在一般工商業方面投資，於是，從内地流入上海來的這樣大量的現金與夫原存上海的資本，，除去用於證劵投資及一切投機事業外，大半便都投資於地産，投資於建築房屋中了。上海房産公會在其爲减低房租問題致市參議會的意見書中</p>
<p>說：「最近八年新建築，約價五萬萬元，加舊時建築，當在二十萬萬左右。」丨這便是近年來上海建築事業發達的明證。</p>
<p>同時，農村經濟的崩潰，内地社會的不安，又使大量的人口流到上海來。所以，近年以來，上海的房屋雖然大增，但房租却一點也未减少，反而增加了許多。六七年來，上海二百六十種日用品的標凖指數都降落了百分之二十，而房租却增高了百分之十二：這更是人們所以願意投資地産房産而不樂於投資工商業的說明。</p>
<p>但是，一般工商業凋敝的結果，必然會使大批的人員破産，失業，窮困，甚至吃飯住房子都成問題。就是房産公會也知道：「最近東區工廠衰落，中區商業尤不景氣，北區則瘡痍未復，獨西區推廣甚遠，居民生計爲難，往往由大屋遷居小屋，由獨居而分屋出租。一於是，一般市民都不能繼續擔負此過高之房租，便發生了减低房租問題，於是，减租運動便日益擴大了起來。據二月二十日「申報」載，參加减租運動的已有十幾國的團體，除中國人外，其中以日俄印度人爲最多。</p>
<p>减租運動之發生和擴大，不僅爲一般經營地産房産者所不高興，即銀錢兩界的巨頭也是很不開心的。因爲後者除自己經營地産房産外，還接受他人的房産之抵押，如果眞的實行减租了，則其在經營地産房産中，在抵押借欵中所獲的厚利必要减少許多。所以，减租問題一被提出，他們就表示反對的意見。他們說近來房産衰落，一旦减低房租，則投資於地産房産中的巨大資本必受影響；其結果不僅牽動金融，而且會要妨害市面之繁榮，影響社會實非淺詳。但是，在另一方面，一般工商業者和大多數的市民於此百業凋敝生計困難中，却是無法繼續擔負過高的房租的；若象目前這樣的過高的房租不能减少，則破産，失業等現象必將要更加普遍化，深刻化。這樣，雙方相持不下，直到現在問題還不能得到解决。</p>
<p>據我看來，上海房屋的業主不僅是中國金融界的鉅子，其中還有外國的富翁，他們在上海都是有最大權威的。就是市商會在最近給市政府的呈文中也表示「囿於資本勢力之下」，對於减租運動「未敢輕於附和」。在此情形下，如果一般市民沒有更大的努力，要想减租運動有好的結果，恐怕是很成問題的罷。</p>
<p>不過，無論如何，大批的工商業者因不能擔負過高房租而停業，大批的人員因不能繳納過高房租而被驅逐到草棚乃至馬路上去：這些現象總是很嚴重的。這一嚴重現象對於市面繁榮，對於社會秩序之影響，必然要比少數房産業主的少得一點利潤的大得多。因此，我希望市政當局能與以特别注意，公平地解决這一减低房租問題；自然，一般市民也是需要更大的努力來實現自己的希望的。</p>
<h3>研究室裏</h3>
<p>— 學文</p>
<p>記得四年前，我從内地一個大學裏走到這社會上來。爲了自己「功課」成績不錯（一個大學生的「學問」自然是有限的）。感謝校長先生聘請我當了文學院社會學系的助敎。正是每一個從大學出來的靑年都發生的職業問題，就注樣容易的解决了，心裏不免暗自歡欣；但一開始工作之後，發覺倒是應該憂戚的多過於應該歡欣的呢。</p>
<p>首先使人煩惱的是自己的學力不足。在大學裏只販得了一點皮毛的學問，就是英文一類的工具學問也沒有完全獲取，這不得不使職務上要發生障礙，因而在研究工作的成績上就不能有如所期的開展。</p>
<p>其次，繁雜的工作的重負，會使你精神上不能有一點輕鬆和閒適。早上八點鐘就得到研究室裏去，要在這裏工作到十二點：午膳休息，從一點再工作到五點。每天要照例如此工作八小時，只有星期例假才是自己的日子。</p>
<p>這種研究室的生活，照理應該是每一個研究學問的人所歡迎的。但說這話的人實在是不曾明瞭研究室生活的内容。這裏面的「雜務」是多過於「研究」·這樣一位助敎先生，是兼任了圖書館員，繪圖員，保管員，書記，庶務等等額外着事於一身，而這些工作又都是異常的機械，異常的沉悶的。</p>
<p>比如說吧，改卷子批分數的工作是决不能受人歡迎的。我們的主任先生任了兩班社會學課程，每班均有一百三四十人，合起來共有二百六七十本卷子。他每隔三四個禮拜要考一次，往往是頭批的考卷剛發還，第二批的又來了。這些考題又都要由你代出，普通的問答題因爲題少還不要緊，一遇到測騐題，則須要在並不多的敎材中，尋出一百個題來，這眞不是容易的事。又如搜集和整理材料也是一個機械繁雜的工作。看報是我們願意的，但要我們把報上有用的材料剪取粘貼，雖明知這有益，但總不大願意動手。粘貼以後還要按性質分類，整理，以便參考檢查。每天要這樣的在三四種中西文報紙上費去三小時以上的時間。</p>
<p>繪圖也是一種重要的繁雜的研究工作。在那助敎生涯的一年中，我繪過了不少關於人類學的，人口學的，社會調查和專題研究的圖。每張圖至少要費八九小時的時間，而繁難的圖則需要你三五日工夫。有一張世界各地人口分佈密度的圖，我記得我是差不多費了四天工夫的。</p>
<p>還有一些「專題研究」需要你分出不少時間。比如家庭問題，婚姻問題的調查與統計，各朝代著名人物的分析和地理的分佈在研究，都市社會和農村社會的局部實際調查，以及自殺，犯罪，失業等等問題都需要你分去一部分的心力。雖然這些專題有學生負責，但你不得不以指導者的地位去襄助他們，而且，你自己也必得單獨地研究一個專題，否則你在研究上毫無表現，則其結果之可悲，是不難想像到的。</p>
<p>研究室裏又有近三十種的中英文社會學刋物和二三百本社會學專書，這管理的責任又無疑的是落在你的身上的。每一本新書報到時你得登記在卡片上，出借時你得和學生辦一切借閱書報的手績。</p>
<p>還有，考試時你得發卷子，監考。這就有一個困難了，這些學生有些是你有朋友，或是你朋友的朋友；不久以前我們都是「同學」，現在我能在他們面前板起面孔干涉他們舞斃嗎？若你眞是這麽「神氣」的話，你也許會遭到不决的。所以在這種時候只得裝馬虎，好像你是一個瞎子似的，不曾看見他們作着有損人格的事情。批卷子的分數和這有同樣的困難，比如，卷子只値得五十七八分，你不好不給他們及格的。</p>
<p>像上面所說的這種生活，必然要使人精神疲軟而渴求着休息。睡眠在這樣的塲合就是甜蜜的了，而這在大學生時代是不曾體會得的。</p>
<p>付與這樣的勞瘁的報酬是每月大洋六十元。這不能算多，也不能算少。聽說上海某大學的助敎一月僅有三十元薪水。一個花了兩三千元（四年計算，每年至少花五百餘元）本錢的大學生肯這樣賤價的出賣知識勞動力是不會沒有原因的：一來是求業不易，二來也是要得到一個好資格（僅次於敎授一級的資格）。好到内地去賣得高價。這是私立大學的情形。國立或省立大學的助敎先生則有每月拿到八十元至一百元的。若是能在高中兼點課，則收入當更可觀了。不過這種幸運是不常見的，除非你與學校當局有特别的關係。</p>

<h3>題香火繚繞妙峰山</h3>
<p>— 比梅</p>
<p>北平通信</p>
<p>妙峰山，位於北平的西北部。據說妙峯山聖母非常的靈騐，所以每年上山朝香的善男信女很是擁擠。</p>
<p>今年陰曆四月初一日，廟門是大開，因客歲時局不靖，許多人多未進香，故今年的香火較往年全興盛。更異於往年的是：東西兩洋的外國人，也追隨我國善男信女上山進香，爲數甚多。歐洲的善男信女下山時，也用黃布巾包頭，滿挿絨花。北平俗呼爲「代福還家」，想這般外國男女也本着這種思想吧？</p>
<p>妙峰山是那般高，故山頂常時積雪，去上香的人，非帶棉及不可，山頂是那般的寒冷，和山下判若兩個世界。</p>
<p>在這裏是不分貧富的，但見老的，少的，男的，女的，全都忙忙碌碌的上山進香。有的是爲了父母，丈夫，妻子，兒女的病來還願的，走一步磕一頭，走三步磕一頭的全有。山是那般高，走到山頂的廟，非數日不可。富人可以坐轎子上去，窮人只有以步當車，走路慢的，一二日可達到。</p>
<p>山旁有小店可以住宿，有小食攤可以買食充飢，丨丨奇怪的是：錢是不論的，有錢的可以多給，貧的給錢少，他們也不爭的。</p>
<p>聞說，上山是要說好話的。如果你的心不誠，你就走不到山頂，雖然你盡力的爬上去，亦要跌下來的。又不能說：「呵！我的鞋要破了！」那你的鞋眞的會破而上不去山的。反之，你的鞋子雖然已破，可是一點不在意，誠心的要去上香，則直到你回香到了家，鞋還是和</p>
<h3>生活圈</h3>
<p>— 白羽</p>
<p>朝陽，隱透出鉛灰的雲翳，光芒的金箭，揭開了濃霧的紗幔，晨曦，在黑暗的氣息下交替。</p>
<p>都市側面的背影。丨握着權威的汽笛，尖銳地狂吼着，驚破了萬千骨肉埋葬在生活中的勞動者的苦夢。</p>
<p>烏黑的濃烟，一串串地，從高聳雲峯的烟囱裏怒吐出來，毁滅了壓榨的汗血。</p>
<p>飢餓線上，掙扎着一羣疲憊的苦力，戰抖的步伐，踏進主宰生命的虎口。</p>
<p>馬達旋轉下的機聲，皮鞭痛韃下的慘號，交響成世界的沒落。</p>
<p>熱風，啣着潑辣，打從赤道飛來的熱風。但，剌不醒迷醉在粉紅氛圍裏的宇宙。</p>
<p>木質的輪軸，叩着崎嶇的石道，劃破了空氣的寂寞。</p>
<p>混沌的曉路，刻上一個混沌的人跡，印上一個混沌的車影。</p>
<p>晨風，捲動着士敏土上的塵沙，漆黑的木箱，埋葬了它們。</p>
<p>醬黑的臉，枯黃的破污的帽，紅色的的衣，一切象徴着他是一個車輪滾動下的淸道夫。</p>
<p>都會的垃圾，不，都會的罪惡！磨逝了他渺小的生命。</p>
<p>活躍的朝氣，彌漫在早市的生活圈。</p>
<p>人的聲浪，馬的長嘶，一切的一切，人在瘋海中生存。</p>
<p>小六子車子的失踪，警察捉住了八手，科學靈乩圖滿街風行，大减價旗幟四季飄揚，一切的一切。畸形的社會，展着本性。</p>
<p>街的中心，一羣年輕的姑娘，她們含情地唱着：丨丨賣花呀！珠珠花！白蘭花！</p>
<p>緋紅的薔薇，相映着緋紅的面　，淸脆的歌聲，激蕩着每個人煩燥的心潮：悲哀的情緒，隨着殘了的花朶消逝。　　乳燕般的她們，天眞，美麗。她們沒有知道生活的鐵鍊已緊鎖着她們靑春的生命，可憐！她們更沒想到都市罪惡的黑影，已包圍着她們整個脆弱的靈魂。</p>

<p>初來時一樣，不會太破的。</p>
<p>在上山的路上，大家全笑嘻嘻地，互相點頭招呼。這裏沒有虚僞，凶惡，沒有階級觀念，全和一家人似的親熱，互相帮助，所以路上不會寂寞的。</p>
<p>山頂的廟很大，香客們可以住在裏面，每天開有素菜給善男信女們充飢。因了妙峰聖母的靈騐，全都以求得籤爲幸。據說妙峰聖母的籤也是非常靈的！（？）</p>
<p>這年頭兒，信佛的人是頂多，事事全求老佛爺的保佑和帮助。由北平到妙</p>
<p>峰山的途上，隨時可看見無數男男女女背黃包袱，用黃巾圍頭，······等。</p>
<p>廟是只每年開一次，四月十外關山門，再要進香，那又得等待一年啦！</p>
<p>香火費的收入，是不能計其數，頗有可觀。一般人全是樂善好施，情願多出錢給妙峰聖母做香火費，托她的福保佑平安。但要呌他們捐給慈善事業，可就不容易了。</p>
<p>雖是經濟破産的年頭兒，到處閙着恐慌，但在這裏，却仍是那般雍貴奢華，看不出一點兒貧困的現象來。</p>

<h3>談自殺</h3>
<p>— 力行女士</p>
<p>「自殺，好的靑年甘願自殺，眞太懦弱，太看輕生命，雖然環境是這樣的窘迫······！」</p>
<p>這是時下對於自殺的靑年所下的批評。</p>
<p>活人之批評死人，爲的是鼓勵活人，因爲人類較其他近緣動物的利害關係更爲密切，故其影響亦較大。其實，我們聽到有人自殺便爲之震駭，尤其是風於同等階級的，更易生鬼死狐悲之感。但若碰到「活死人」（一般在浪費社會財富，坐食而不做事的人時，便只有淡然置之。平情而論，宛轉偷生，忍辱苟活，活着旣無補於生計，而死去時，不但能够和闊人們，富翁們，殊途同歸，同歸到「濟慈」「夜鶯歌」中所讚美的，一切不和諧的都和諧了的死境，而且，欠人的債絶對不用淸還，在精神上算是達到平等自由的領域，較活着受氣多好？這是一種實騐的人生觀。</p>
<p>有些人是絶對不肯自殺的，這種人做起事來老是隨隨便便，生活上得過且過。對人評事，老是用母羚羊觀風嗅敵的神氣去應對，從不曾敢有自己的主張，故結論也就不外是是！是！這種人的靈魂近似春郊的飛絮，飄飄忽忽。其生存的方式和馬牛同樣，營營竟日，不知其所以然，這是一種人生觀。</p>
<p>有些人是看輕自殺，嘲笑自殺的，這種人具着，種陰沉沉的人生觀，不知有公益，不惑於精神上的創造，他們相信「公道是强者的利益，善者爲無智，要者是明哲」的哲理，使畢生的精力用在創造個人的幸福上。這種人你如果問他活着有什麽意思，他便會問你人類求生存的目的是什麽。你如果以爲他們的生命是浪費，他便會嘲笑你們奮鬥祇剩幾莖賣不出的頭髮是懦弱的象徴。卽使國破敵臨，他們也絶對不至發憤得自殺，或反抗；因爲他們老早便准備着到外國去做避世的亡國奴。</p>
<p>還有一些人是對自殺者表示同情，但自己决不肯自殺。這種人大多屬於個性剛毅者，他們有時也陷於生活窘迫的境地，但他們並不因此而悲觀，他們對於被壓迫者極表同情，引大多數人的痛苦爲自己的痛苦，引國家民族的恥辱爲自己的恥辱；他們在實際上是十足的傻子，所受的挫折較一般人爲多，而物質上的享樂却常較一般人爲少。但這種人的精神領域較一般人佔据得大，假如他們成功一種有利於羣衆的事對的話。</p>
<p>然而，這種傻子很少發見，在現社會之上；因爲現在中國人聰明的太多，除非爲自己的利益肯拚命的爭鬥之外，幾乎聽到上述的傻子們的行爲時便感到驚奇；故中國人將來有同猶太人一樣命運的可能。</p>
<p>在這種聰明人太多的社會上，自殺死去的人日見增多，同時，在過着緩性自殺的爲數更多；只是前者顯而易見，後者却在嘲笑前者的時候已踏上前者的路線，不過，至死還不憬悟罷了。</p>

<h3>美大企業家　福特所創辦　徒弟學校</h3>
<p>— 陳際雲</p>
<p>學徒制確是一種很好的制度，可是在我們中國，衹有死做，無晝無夜的又沒有休息的時間，好像苦工一般，於未成年小孩的各方面，影響很大，發育的不良，結核病的跋扈，可以說都是這種生活的結果。我現在且把美國大企業家福特所辦的徒弟學校介紹於下，以供工商界參考：</p>
<p>福特徒弟學校原來的目的，是祇收容無交或父母俱無的孤兒，使他們將來能有做工的機會，後來福特公司職工的子弟，也可隨意入學。他這學校，本是養成職工的，是以造就經營自己的生活的人爲目的的。不僅要他能够自立，而且是以造就他自己比較别人更能經營善良生活的人爲目的的，但是，給他們以做工的特權，並不是養成他們的依賴心的敎育，而是養成他們能創造，能支配自己的生活爲目的的。所以，照這種方法做去，他這學校的敎育方針</p>
<p>，就有三個重要點。第一·少年總還是少年·不要使他們做成早成功的營動者。第二·學業要隨着實騐並行。第三·不是離形敎育，他的製作品，必要實在合用。以下再看他對於這條的詳細實施。</p>
<p>（一）小孩子自然當照小孩子遇，小孩子的本性，是要獎勵的。觀察在工塲和敎室的小孩子，是要使他們看見自己的光明，要使他們有自己做「主人翁」的意識，要使他們知道是替自己做事，要使他們覺得有味而且必要熱心，使他們要學小孩干們應該學的，要學在家裏要問而沒有人答復他們的問題的。</p>
<p>卽令小孩子想做勞動者，也要使他們莫忘記自己是小孩子，這一點是最要緊的。他們的製品，經過檢查之後，便賣給福特公司，作爲學校的經費。如有做壞的製品，便是學校的損失。所以學生和學校，都得打起精神做事，不知不覺，都發生了對於做事的責任觀念。因此，學校的工塲，一禮拜也給他們奬金七元二角至十八元的工錢。他們畢業以後，旣有了一般的敎育，自然也有了相當的專門知識，他們所有的技術也有和大人一樣的熟練的，所以隨便到何處工塲，都可以發揮手腕去做事。如有願意繼續求學的，旣有相當的熟練，也可以半工半讀，得到較大的工錢，並沒有規定畢業以後便負有須到福特工塲做工的義務。</p>
<p>（二）學問與技術，不能不同時並進，這是第二主義。死的學問，紙上的學問，都不是職工的學問。必然要活的學問，要實地的學問才行。技術，自然不是專靠雛型練習得來的。所以他們的敎科書，便是福特工塲。例如所敎的算術，乃是工塲實際活動的實在切用的問題。地</p>
<p>理也是一樣，是間：把汽車送到新嘉坡去，應該搭甚麽船？走那條路？連淸單收條，也都拿給他們看。是這樣的推到世界各處，把實在的商業上的路程，都給他們一一的詳細說明。所敎的物理化學，也是一樣。敎員從實地去說明，學生也從實地去質問，把機器都一件一件的拆開去說明，隨後又敎他們如何裝置便能轉動。學生要做高尙和細徴的製品，便不能不懂得相應的難解的問題，也必替他們詳細說明。而且常常要他們學着修理機器。</p>
<p>（三）便是不可傷害學生的自尊心，自己活動去産生貨物的自尊心，以助長他們的責任觀念，這是第三觀念。所以他們在學校，必要做工，對於他們的工作，也給工錢。在福特學校，開先是一日之中，以三分之一，在敎室敎課，三分之二在工塲敎做工。後來知道是這樣在一日之中變更，於他們的進步大有妨害。現在便規定了一禮拜在敎室敎課，兩禮拜在工塲敎做工。</p>
<p>上述的學課及實習以外，也有遊戲和體操，是和普通的學校一樣的。星期五，在購堂裏也開有許多的會，任聽他們自由去討論的。</p>
<p>福特徒弟學校的設施是如此，不知我們中國實行徒弟制的機關，看了要作如何的感想。</p>

<p>言論</p>
<h3>論提倡體育</h3>
<p>— 少問</p>
<p>近年以來，咱們老大的中國似乎也講起摩登來了。提倡什麽，復興什麽，已成爲了咱們最摩登的口號。如果大家眞的依此類摩登口號「硬幹」「苦幹」下去，那老大的中國也許有成爲美利堅式的摩登國家之可能。然而不幸，當我們提倡國貨的時候，那些摩登姑娘和少爺們却專門去購買外國的商品；當我們努力於復興農村運動的時候，那些有錢的老爺太太們却偏要把他們的金銀財寳存在外國銀行裏，不拿到農村裏去流通。於是，提倡國貨運動失敗：於是，農村金融窘迫，整個復興農村運動都沒有成績。</p>
<p>不過，事情往往是不能一槪而論的。雖然我們在别的運動中失敗了，沒有成績，但提倡體育運動却有了很大的收穫。你看，什麽地方運動會呀，什麽全國運動會呀，什麽遠東運動會呀，辦得多麽的熱鬧！每在這些運動會進行的時候，全國大小報紙都要以最大篇幅來爲之宣傳鼓吹；今天載某女郎威震何處，明天刋某戰士獨得錦標，形勢的緊張，實不亞於世界大戰之到來！丨丨由此可見人們對於提倡體育是如何的熱心，如何的一致，而我們的提倡體育運動又是表現出了如何偉大的成績！</p>
<p>但是，我不知道這樣地提倡體育有什麽意義。我以爲體育運動只可當作我們日常功課的一部份，不應作爲唯一的要務。要是一般靑年時時刻刻都去跑，跳，游泳，打球，······從事體育運動，不管一切，則結果將成爲怎樣的人呢？他們除了會跑會跳······外，於國家社會，於學術文化將會有什麽供獻呢？這是不難想像到的。同時，體育運動的宗旨，應該是在强健身體，不當是在賭博似的爭勝，出風頭。可是，現在我們所提倡的體育運動，却是把牠當作專門事業來提倡的，各個體育學校的學生，一切體育家，除了終日運動外，不僅不過問有關國家社會的一切問題，甚至連各種學術也不去研究。你看，十有九個運動員，不都是腦筋簡單，沒有學識的嗎？至於他們終日運動的目的，當然是在想當選手，赴運動會，奪取錦標。丨丨像這樣的提倡體育，顯然是另有用意的。</p>
<p>有人說，提倡體育可以救國。假如全國人民都因提倡體育面健壯了，國家豈不是就强盛了嗎？不錯，國家要强盛，必要國民的身體健康，如果國民都是虚弱的病夫，那國家是不會强盛的，但却不能說只要國民有健壯的身體，國家就會富强，非洲的土人，美洲的黑人，印度阿三，都是很健壯的，但他們現在却連國家都沒有了。同時，就是國民身體的健壯，也不是我們這樣地提倡體育可以得到的。我們知道，沒有飯喫，沒有衣穿，受飢受寒，苦痛愁悶的人，無論怎樣，其身體也是不會健壯的。目前中國大多數的國民都在失業，窮困，飢餓，寒冷的襲擊中，在此情形下，要想這樣地提倡體育來健壯國民的身體，因而挽救國家的危亡，豈非夢想？　　事實上，中國的一切災難，都是帝國主義直接間接製造成的，要振救中國，並不需要這樣地提倡體育，而是需要我們以正確的辦法領導中國人民起來與帝國主義奮鬭。我敢武斷地說，假如中國國民都起來救國了，中國馬上就可脫離一切災難！反之，假如我們要一般國民不管有關國家社會的一切問題，只是提倡賭博似的體育，那結果就在全球運動會中奪得了所有的錦標，國家的危亡也是不會因之消滅的。</p>
<p>「爲國爭光」，這是人們常常用來鼓勵赴國外的什麽運動會的「健兒」們的話。其意義是：雖然一切皆不如人，但倘若我們的「健兒」在國外的什麽運動會中得到了勝利，那國家便就非常光榮了。所以我們應該提倡體育來「爲國爭光」。這完全是阿Ｑ主義的表現！國家的土地幾省幾省地被人奪去了，全國人民都受着帝國主義的欺侮和壓迫，不圖自新，反而要去提倡體育來「爲國爭光」，除了善於自欺自慰的阿Ｑ先生外，恐怕誰也做不出來。</p>
<p>而且，老實說，如果我們老是這樣不進步，國家老是保持着這樣的狀態，那就在什麽全球運動會，什麽遠東運動會中，也是爭不到什麽「光」的。這次遠東運動會之爲日本操縱，便是顯然的例證。</p>

<h3>巡迴書店</h3>
<p>— 沙契</p>
<p>跟着第二五年計劃的開始，蘇聯鄕村中的每一個「集體農塲」與農民寄宿舍前，一到春耕播種與秋收分配糧食的時季，就有大批大批的摩托卡車，載了各種各樣適合于農民閱讀的書籍開來，以極低廉的價格，出賣給農民。每一部卡車就是一爿書店，他們稱這種摩托車爲「巡　書店」。在賣書而外，還附帶電影放映機片，與無綫電收音機，在這兒免費放映與播音着最好的節目，使一般農民在娛樂中受着良好的敎育。</p>
<p>「巡迴書店」是直接由中央蘇維埃的人民文化敎育委員會組織的「中央書社」所創辦的，「中央書社」在鄕村中每一「政治區分所」内設立一座土耳其式的書亭丨也可以說是書站，每一書亭置備了一輛摩托卡車，載了書籍等往農塲與宿舍巡迴地開着。</p>
<p>今年丨一九三四年春耕之前，莫斯科的人民文化敎育委員會，動員了一千個會員到鄕間去參加他們的「中央書社」。新添了一千所土耳其式的大書亭，其中以三百所設在集體農塲，專供一般播種的農民購買，二百所附設在鐵道運輸局裏。「中央書社」到現在爲止已經開辦了三千五百二十所書亭了，預計到本年秋收時季，有增加到四千五百所的可能。</p>
<p>爲着使一般農民容易接近文學藝術的思想，「中央書社」實行了去年人民文化敎育委員會的决議案，編製一種專門供給鄕村人民閱讀的書目丨這裏面包括八十五種文學藝術的名著交給國家出版部印行。爲了農民的容易考查與選購所愛的書，「中央書社」在每一書目下，特别用了最淺近的文字做着精細的說明。國家出版部更用大號的活字排印，讓一般農民讀來毫不費勁。</p>
<p>今年春耕的時候，「中央書社」從莫斯科每天運輸一百包新書到各鄕政治區分所的書亭裏，再由那兒巡迴到各個集體農場，這兒的讀者現在已獲得六百五十萬册的文藝書籍了。</p>
<h3>五年計劃中的國營販賣業</h3>
<p>— 利人</p>
<p>蘇聯國家經濟的急遽成長，是和國營販賣業（Ｓｔａｔｅ　ｒｅｔａｉｌ　ｔｒａｄｅ）的發達相伴並行的。其所以能有如此成長發展的原因，無疑的是因爲一般人民生活狀况的改善。</p>
<p>在重工業的巨量發展和社會主義農村經濟的再建以及商品生産的增加的基礎上，使輕工業的發展，無論從生産數量方面看，或從技術基礎的再建方面看，都成爲非常的可能。</p>
<p>輕工業的發展是使國營販賣業興盛的原動力。</p>
<p>在過去的十一年中，蘇聯國營販賣業的貿易額，在一九二二丨二三兩年僅有三·五六○·○○○·○○○盧布，到一九三二年已增加到三九·九○○·○○○·○○○盧布（十一年中的總數）。</p>
<p>因國營販賣業與合作社組織的發達·市塲上已將私人資本的貿易摒除了。</p>
<p>在一九二二丨二三年，私人貿易佔全國總貿易百分之七十五點三；這個百分比到一九三○年已降到百分之五點八，到一九三一年，這種私人經營已完全失其地位了。</p>
<p>蘇聯國營販賣業是從一九三零年開始發達的，經過一九三一年和一九三二年已到了頂點。一九三零年的貿易額僅二·五○○·○○○·○○○盧布，一九三一年升到六·五○○·○○○·○○○盧布，一九三二年增到八·○○○·○○○·○○○盧布。</p>
<p>國營販賣業是由一個商業委員會管理的，通　大的零售商店，和許多專售某一類貨物的商業托辣斯，而進行販賣。例如肉業托辣斯，在牠管理下的許多商店是專售肉類的。牛乳托辣斯是專供給每天的牛乳的。魚業托辣斯是專供給大衆各種的魚類食品的。</p>
<p>此外還有專門售賣某一類普通日用貨物的販賣機關。例如，衣業托辣斯的許多商店是專售衣物的。編織物托辣斯的許多商店是專售編織物的，等等。</p>
<p>除了這些特殊的商店以外；還有種包含各種部門的百貨商店；顧客可以在這裏買到所要買的各種貨物。</p>
<p>蘇聯的計劃經濟，使有三十萬之多的上述各種商店，能在最適宜最便利的地方爲廣大的公衆利益而服務。</p>
<p>還有應該說到的，就是在這國營販賣業的體系下，另有一種運用輓近商業技術及注意如何爲顧客服務的模範商店的建立。商業上通常事務的組織化，貨物的精密衡量，機械的商業用具的儘量利用，「代收貨價」制的運用，貨物捷的運送至買主的家庭等丨這些都是這種模範商店的特色。</p>
<p>國營販賣業組織還包含許多飲食方面的商店，如飯店，食堂，廚房工塲等，這些也都是爲廣大的公衆利益而服務的。</p>
<p>國營販賣業和合作社的發達，是跟着集體農塲的貿易的興盛而　來的。集　農人與個人小農把他們生産的剩餘貨品帶到都市裏來，照通行的價格售賣與國營商業機關。</p>
<p>按照第二五年計劃的規定，是要特别注意專業化的托辣斯業的，卽特别注意衣，鞋襪，雜貨的供給：同樣也注意食物原料如牛油，魚類，肉類的供給，等。</p>
<p>除了這些，第二五年計劃還規定要開辦許多大百貨商店，現在爲這種商店已蓋了許多高層的樓房了。</p>
<p>國營販賣業有計劃的增進，在第二五年計劃中，對於工人的集體農人的利益是同樣注意的。這使蘇聯商業及商業技術的有計劃的發展，成爲高速的飛躍</p>
<p>的。</p>

<h3>航空救國　飛行船發明的故事（一）</h3>
<p>— 叔麟</p>
<p>一憧憬着鳥的飛翔</p>
<p>我們在小時候，看到鳥在空中自由自在的飛時，心裏想：「假如我們也能像那樣的飛，該多麽愉快呢！」</p>
<p>麥成熟時，走到郊外，許多的燕子翻着白肚皮在往返飛翔，我們看到了，又希望着我們也會變成燕子。</p>
<p>空中飛行這件事，是人類有始以來最大的希望。不論那一國的神話裏，必定有生翅膀的天人或長着飛羽的天馬出現，在空中自由自在的飛行。由此看來，我們可以明白從前的人對於飛行這件事是有着怎樣的憧憬。</p>
<p>然而，人類直到最近，飛行空中，還是絶對的不可能。有名的拉伊脫兄弟，一千九百○三年以自己發明的飛行機飛行空中，距今還不過二三十年。</p>
<p>在此，我們不能不知道：飛行機的發明是費了不知多少人寳貴的時間，金錢，甚至有時失却自己的生命方成功的。</p>
<p>「飛行機是拉伊脫發明的，是拉伊脫苦心孤詣的結果，丨丨」事實上决不如是簡單。在拉伊脫的發明以前，已有不知多少人，因不能達其目的，默默無聞的含怨而死去。</p>
<p>一椿發明，决非一個人的力量所能辦到的。多數的人，把一點，一滴的研究累積起來，一旦造成了一椿發明。在發明以前，眞不知已付却多少犧牲呢！　　二氣球的起源</p>
<p>飛行空中的機械有種種的區别，現在假定大别爲二：</p>
<p>一、比空氣重的機械</p>
<p>二、比空氣輕的機械</p>
<p>比空氣重的機械就是現在的飛行機，機體自身比空氣重，不能靜止的浮在空中。反之比空氣輕的機械就是現在的飛行船，機體自身比空氣輕，可以宛如海中浮月般靜靜的浮在空中。（未完）</p>

<h3>Japanese Vice-Consul in Nanjing, Kuramoto, Suddenly Reported Missing - Inquiries About His Whereabouts Have Been Made to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Japanese Residents Want to Make a Big Deal Out of It Again</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A vice-consul named Kuramoto at the Japanese Consulate in Nanjing did not return to the consulate after seeing Arima off at the station on the evening of the 8th. The Japanese Consulate requested our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and military and police agencies to investigate on the 9th, but there was still no information as of late evening. (9th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kuramoto Hideaki, Consul General of the Nanjing Consulate General, suddenly went missing around 10:30 last night near the Consulate General. Consul General Suma and all members of the consulate are making every effort to search for him, but as of 1:00 p.m. today, he is still nowhere to be found. Last night, Mr. Kuramoto was going to see Minister Arima off to Shanghai, and around 10:00 he went from his residence at No. 62 Yin Yang Ying, Gulou to the Consulate General. Later, because the consulate's car was full, he went out the side door of the consulate to find a taxi, and has not been seen since. He was not seen at the station either. After 12:00 a.m., Mrs. Kuramoto called, saying that Kuramoto had not yet returned home, and it was then that his disappearance was discovered.

<h3>Majiagou Coal Mine Workers Strike</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 12:00 midnight on the 8th, more than a thousand workers at the Kailuan Majiagou Coal Mine went on strike because the mine reduced working hours and they could not maintain their livelihoods. After receiving the report, the mine immediately sent Secretary Zhang Guanru to appease them. He arrived in the mining area at 3:30 p.m. on the 9th and is attempting to mediate with the director of the local labor liaison office. However, no agreement has been reached. Li Yinchun, the Hebei Industrial Bureau inspector stationed in the Tangshan mine, and Zhao Xun, the director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, have rushed to mediate. (9th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The reason for the Majiagou mine workers' strike is that the mine uses a contracting system where workers' wages are based on the amount of coal produced. The mine originally produced 2,300 tons per day, but the mine management, due to overproduction and slow sales of stored coal, has reduced production and adjusted the workforce. Currently, the entire mine only produces 400 tons per day, so each person's daily wage is limited, making it impossible to maintain a living. They previously requested the mine to restore the original state, but after two days without a response, they went on strike. It is reported that the mine's security team intends to escalate measures and has stepped up security. (9th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Foreign Debt and the Nishihara Loan Issue</h3>
<p>Regarding the Nishihara Loans, they were loans made to China by the Terauchi Cabinet of Japan around 1918 and 1919. They were mediated by Japanese banker Kamezo Nishihara, hence the name Nishihara Loans. However, the exact amount is subject to various rumors. Some say 300 to 400 million yuan, others say 200 million yuan. According to recent announcements by the Japanese side, it was 130 million Japanese yen. The loan content is divided into seven items: Communications Bank Loan, Wireless Telegraph Loan, Jihui Railway Loan, War Participation Loan, Shandong Jinan-Shunde-Gaoxu Railway Loan, Manchurian-Mongolian Four Railways Loan, and Jilin-Heilongjiang Forestry and Mining Loan. This was the stated purpose when the loans were raised. In reality, Japan took advantage of the unprecedented opportunity of the European War and colluded with the Northern Warlords to realize its ambition of monopolizing China's economic power. At the same time, it provided a suitable outlet for the surplus money accumulated in the country due to the impact of the war. According to the secret records of Katsuda Kazue, the Minister of Finance in the Terauchi Cabinet, the establishment of each of these loans had its own profound intentions. For example: (1) The purpose of the Communications Bank Loan was to establish a relationship between the bank and Japanese banks in order to understand the internal affairs of the Chinese banking industry, and to require the employment of Japanese people as business consultants. (2) The Wireless Telegraph Loan used all the property and income of the Chinese government related to national wireless telegraph as collateral. In addition, Japan had priority rights regarding the need to hire foreign technicians and supply telecommunications materials for the telecommunications industry, which was sufficient to control the entire Chinese wireless telegraph industry. (3) The Jihui Railway connected Korea and Chengde, which was very convenient for developing Manchuria and connecting the economies of Korea and Manchuria. (4) The War Participation Loan was established following the Sino-Japanese Military Agreement. After the agreement was signed, Japan's position on the mainland became more solid. It was Japan's natural obligation to assist China financially for this agreement. (5) Japan drove out German forces from Shandong and further sought to seize absolute economic superiority. The Chinese government agreed with Japan that if the Gaomi-Xuzhou line were to be laid using the Jinan-Shunde line, Japan would be given priority in order to facilitate Japanese commercial trade. (6) The Manchurian-Mongolian Four Railways: (A) The railway from Jehol to Taonan. (B) The railway from Taonan to Changchun. (C) The railway from Jilin via Hailongcheng to Kaiyuan. (D) A railway from one point on the Rehe-Taonan railway to a seaport. These railways were necessary for the economic development of Manchuria and Mongolia and for the transportation links with Korea. The construction of the fourth line was particularly noteworthy. Once this line was completed, it could connect Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and several northern provinces of China as desired. (7) Forestry and mining were the most abundant natural products of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. The loan was secured by all the gold mines and state-owned forests in the two provinces and their income. The production of gold in Manchuria was increasing day by day, which was very gratifying from Japan's point of view. Also, in terms of wood, Japan could not help but rely on the forests of Jilin and Heilongjiang for building materials or paper-making materials. Therefore, investing in such a use could not be said to be very profitable. This was roughly Katsuta's view. However, there were also many Japanese who opposed the Nishihara Loans on the grounds that they were established hastily, the conditions were too favorable, and the collateral was not reliable.</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have reported that the Japanese government is demanding that our country reorganize its old debts, and that important figures from Japanese financial groups are traveling to China in groups and are said to be actively involved. This matter is of great importance and must be studied carefully.</p>
<p>China's foreign debts can be broadly divided into two types: those with solid collateral and those without solid collateral. Those with solid collateral are easy to reorganize, so let us not discuss them for now. Those without solid collateral are indeed extremely difficult problems to sort out.</p>
<p>According to a report by the former Financial Reorganization Committee in Peiping (Beijing), China's total unsecured foreign debt was 486,646,003 yuan in national currency. Among them, the various unsecured debts to Japan managed by the Ministry of Finance, as of the end of 1925, totaled approximately 305,315,687 yuan in national currency, including principal and interest, accounting for 63% of the total.</p>
<p>Among the unsecured debts to Japan, the Nishihara Loans are the largest in amount and the most difficult to reorganize. According to Japanese announcements, the total principal amount of the Nishihara Loans was 130 million Japanese yen. The content includes seven items: Communications Bank Loan, Wireless Telegraph Loan, Jihui Railway Loan, War Participation Loan, Shandong Railway Loan, Manchurian-Mongolian Four Railways Loan, and Jilin-Heilongjiang Forestry and Mining Railway Loan. Today, whether we have an urgent obligation to reorganize these loans, first we must ask about the background of their establishment, and second we must ask about the nature of their purpose. The completion of the Nishihara Loans was still between 1918 and 1919. At that time, the European War was in full swing, and the Japanese Terauchi Cabinet took advantage of the fact that the European powers were killing each other and had no time to look east, and tried to get close to the Northern Warlords in our country in order to achieve its goal of monopolistic aggression against China. Katsuda Kazue, the Minister of Finance during the Terauchi Cabinet, once said, "In the autumn of 1916, Count Terauchi rose up and organized a cabinet, with the development of China's economy as a major policy program... Therefore, during the existence of this cabinet, the rights acquired by the Empire far exceeded those of previous generations." This shows his complacency.</p>
<p>Terauchi and Katsuda made it their policy to encourage investment in China, promote trade relations with China, and control Chinese financial institutions. Japanese investment banks, such as the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Bank of Taiwan, and the Bank of Korea, under the guidance of the two, spared no effort to provide the Northern Warlords of our country with huge amounts of surplus funds at the time for their squandering, in order to seek benefits in politics, economics, and military affairs. They did not even bother to consider whether the loan collateral was reliable, let alone the public opinion of the people of our country.</p>
<p>Therefore, the so-called Nishihara Loans, in terms of the background of their establishment, are a kind of economic weapon used by the Japanese to invade China. Their toxicity is no less than the Twenty-One Demands of the Okuma era. They are by no means comparable to ordinary loans. If we go a step further and examine the nature of the purpose of these loans, we will know that loans such as the Jihui Railway, Manchurian-Mongolian Four Railways, and Jilin-Heilongjiang Forestry and Mining Loan all advertise the operation of Northeast businesses, regardless of the motives for their establishment. Today, the Japanese have already occupied the land and markets of our Northeast, and seized the financial resources of our Northeast. On the one hand, they deprive people of the ability to repay debts and the collateral for the loans, and on the other hand, they force people to repay the debts. Even in terms of ordinary loan relationships, there is no such reason. What's more, the Nishihara Loans are the crystallization of Japanese conspiracies? Perhaps some will say, "The Japanese are simply using this as an excuse to coerce us. If China is unwilling to reorganize its old debts, it must raise new debts." But the more debts are raised, the more we will be bound by them. If we cannot withstand the pressure from the Japanese and end up yielding, it would be no different from suicide.</p>
<p>In short, the reorganization of foreign debt is our consistent position. If the Japanese raise legitimate demands, we will not hesitate to negotiate with them. However, the Nishihara Loans have special characteristics and background. If the Japanese must demand reorganization, they should first return the collateral for the loans to us. Unreasonable and harsh demands should be firmly rejected.</p>

<p>Special Telegraph The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. received a special telegram from London stating that, according to the London Financial Times' visit to New York, the biggest reason for the strength or weakness of the New York securities market is the resurgence of inflation. It is now firmly predicted that the US Treasury Department will reduce the value of the US dollar in the coming weeks, this time to 50 cents. There is also a rumor on Wall Street that Germany's financial situation is now very difficult, and France may also abandon the gold standard, and the exchange value of the British pound will also be reduced. The US dollar is in this position and cannot support itself. In addition, there is another reason, that is, the US government needs more funds to carry out its recovery program. If the value of the US dollar is reduced to 50 cents, 140 billion yuan can be obtained.</p>

<h3>Disarmament Ends Temporarily, World Situation Takes a Sharp Turn: Italian, German, French, and British Leaders to Meet Separately; Little Entente Officially Recognizes Soviet Russia; Proposal for a Pacific Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The General Disarmament Commission decided today to adjourn for several months. The general situation is changing rapidly. German Chancellor Hitler has agreed to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Venice early next week to discuss the League of Nations and disarmament issues. This will have a significant impact on modern European history. French Foreign Minister Barthou has also accepted Prime Minister Mussolini's invitation to hold a similar meeting in Rome in early July. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov held lengthy meetings with the foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Significant progress has been made on the issue of the Little Entente recognizing Soviet Russia, and the balance of power in Europe is about to undergo major changes. After meeting with the Little Entente countries, Litvinov also held an important dinner meeting with U.S. Special Envoy Davis to discuss the Soviet Russian proposal for a non-aggression pact among Pacific nations. (Ninth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Disarmament Conference has now entered a more pleasant phase. The focus of European political interest has shifted to the upcoming meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Chancellor Hitler. According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, negotiations between the dictators of Italy and Germany have been going on for some time, but Rome has flatly denied this, saying that Italy has not received any proposal from Germany for a meeting with the Italian Prime Minister. A Reuters dispatch from Berlin also stated that the location and time of the German-Italian meeting will be decided soon. At the same time, a Reuters correspondent in Geneva telephoned England, reportedly saying that French Foreign Minister Barthou had heard from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that the Italian Prime Minister would meet Hitler in Venice in the middle of next week. The Italian Prime Minister also asked Barthou if he could visit Rome before or after Hitler's visit to Italy. It is said that the French Foreign Minister replied with vague remarks. (Ninth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome learned today from reliable sources that German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will meet in Venice on Monday or Tuesday. This is a historically significant meeting that will mark an era. Chancellor Hitler will fly from Berlin to Venice on Sunday. The official announcement of this matter has not yet been made, in fact, officials from the Foreign Ministries of Rome and Berlin are even denying it. However, the responsible party told the Associated Press that the meeting was invited by Prime Minister Mussolini and agreed to by Chancellor Hitler. Diplomats view this meeting as related to Germany's return to the League of Nations, its renewed participation in the Disarmament Conference, and Mussolini's last-ditch effort to salvage the Disarmament Conference. (Ninth National Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome, according to a Geneva dispatch, the Italian government has expressed to the French and German governments that it hopes that the responsible politicians of Italy, France, and Germany will choose a suitable location to meet with each other.

If the exchange of views between the Italian and German leaders is realized, its content will not be of a secret nature. France will also participate, but whether the form of participation will be direct or indirect is still unknown. (Eighth Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Little Entente Recognizes Soviet Russia: Capital of Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources and verified in Geneva, the foreign ministers of the three Little Entente countries jointly decided in Geneva to immediately recognize Soviet Russia de jure. Yesterday, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, and Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Litvinov, exchanged letters of mutual recognition. These letters will be published simultaneously in the capitals of Czechoslovakia and Romania, and in Moscow tonight. In addition, Yugoslavia will follow suit later and recognize the Soviet Union in the same way. (Ninth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and the foreign ministers of the Little Entente countries on the issue of recognition did not end until 1:00 a.m. this morning. In addition to Litvinov, those who participated in the round table meeting included Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtic. The conditions for recognition by Czechoslovakia and Romania have been agreed upon. However, regarding Yugoslavia, there are still some minor points of contention to be resolved. It is believed that if a complete agreement cannot be reached at this meeting, the Little Entente's recognition of Soviet Russia will have to wait until after the Little Entente's conference in Bucharest in late June.

<h3>Disarmament Temporarily Improved; Crisis Has Been Averted; Committee to Be Formed Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The perilous situation of the London Disarmament Conference has been averted. The General Commission met today in an atmosphere of peace and friendship and immediately passed the compromise proposal agreed upon by the chief representatives of Britain, France, and the United States. The proposal included: (1) Reaffirming that the conclusion of a general convention is the most urgent task; (2) Stipulating the procedures for immediate work to achieve this goal; (3) Recognizing the necessity of Germany's return to the conference. With the passage of this proposal by the General Commission, the work of the Disarmament Conference has made significant progress. The General Commission then announced the adjournment of the meeting until 3:30 p.m. on Monday next week, at which time two special committees will be formed, one to consider the issue of European regional security agreements and the other to consider the issue of guarantees for the implementation and supervision of the convention.</p>
<p>Before the proposal was passed, British representative Eden emphasized the importance of maintaining the traditional friendship between Britain and France and said that the cooperation of several major powers is indispensable, but the current environment is very difficult because they are not participating in the conference. However, a compromise has now been reached under these difficult circumstances. Britain's view of Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference has remained unchanged, and it deeply feels that since Germany's withdrawal from the conference, disarmament and international understanding have been greatly damaged. It hopes that the German government will return to the conference in an improved atmosphere of understanding to engage in the work that has been jointly undertaken for nearly two years.</p>
<p>Russian representative Litvinov's attitude today was very moderate, and his harmonious spirit surprised the representatives of various countries. Litvinov said that the Soviet Union has never opposed any point in the proposal, and he hopes that the Soviet Union's concept of a peace conference will always exist in the document archives of various countries' cabinets. The soldiers of the Red Army are actually the most peace-loving people in the world. Russia vows to work together with all nations and governments to achieve world peace.</p>
<p>Italian representative Soragna and Polish representative Raczyński both made reservations. The Italian representative stated that unless the political issues are resolved, he fears that the Disarmament Conference may not make appropriate progress. Litvinov was also not entirely satisfied with the proposal, so he did not vote when the proposal was formally presented.</p>
<p>The main representatives are returning to their countries tonight, so the unprecedented storms of the Disarmament Conference have temporarily calmed down. (Eighth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Since the Davis Compromise was reached, the prospects for disarmament are much more optimistic, and the crisis of the conference breaking down seems to have passed for the time being. The resolution passed by the General Commission clearly indicates that the invitation to Germany to return to the seat is due to the mediation of the U.S. representative. It is reported that the British delegation had received instructions from London beforehand, stating that if there was no room left for continued talks with Germany, there was no need to proceed with the conference. The Italian delegation also held the same attitude. The Davis proposal accommodates France's claims on the one hand, referring the two major issues of security and disarmament to the committees for continued discussion, and on the other hand, stipulating that the General Assembly should adjourn to await the outcome of the invitation to Germany to return before reconvening. Therefore, this resolution made a clear provision for inviting Germany. This case is said to have been distributed to the governments of participating countries for filing. The Disarmament Conference may adjourn for two or three months to facilitate the negotiation of a Franco-German compromise and to contact Germany to return to the League of Nations. Therefore, the Disarmament Conference may be extended for several months. (Eighth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Disarmament Commission passed the Davis proposal today, stipulating an indefinite adjournment. During the adjournment period, the four committees will continue to study various disarmament proposals and conduct negotiations on Germany's return to the conference. On Monday afternoon, the General Commission will reconvene to begin establishing the four committees in the Davis proposal. This proposal has been unanimously accepted by France and Britain. Experts commented on this proposal, saying that an agreement has been reached on the issue of future disarmament, but it still hides the huge gaps between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy on fundamental issues. It is still unknown whether the alliance between France and Russia will worsen Anglo-French relations, making it difficult for the country to return to the League of Nations. When the General Commission reconvenes this term, representatives from various countries will strive to be selected for the committees and then quietly adjourn until October, and then decide whether to advance or retreat depending on the situation of the contacts with Germany. It is noteworthy that Japan did not participate in the secret deliberations yesterday or today. The General Commission met at 4:10 p.m. this afternoon and adjourned at 6:10 p.m. French Foreign Minister Barthou proposed the Davis proposal next Monday. Barthou insisted that France hopes that Germany will automatically return to Geneva. Barthou said, "We let Germany act freely. If Germany closes its door, we cannot open it. Only Germany can open this door. We do not want to pursue a policy of blockade, this is not the doctrine we hold." Davis declared that this case is of great contribution to European peace. Davis said, "This case has not resolved all the issues of disarmament, but it has changed the atmosphere of the conference from disappointment to genuine hope." Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov supported this case, saying that there was nothing to oppose. Litvinov also hoped that his proposal for a non-aggression pact and the restructuring of the Disarmament Conference into a peace conference would no longer be shelved by diplomats and could be revisited for discussion. Six neutral countries also expressed their acceptance. (Eighth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Attitudes of Various Countries' Representatives: Soviet Russia Also Supports Compromise Proposal; Italy and Hungary Reserve; Austria Does Not Express</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference met at 4:15 p.m. today. French Foreign Minister Barthou explained the compromise proposal agreed upon by him, Eden, and Davis, praising the contributions of the British and American representatives. Regarding Germany's return to the Disarmament Conference, Barthou said that although the resolution mentions Germany's return to the Disarmament Conference, discussions on this matter should be proposed and conducted by the governments of various countries. Germany's return to Geneva is not crucial to the disarmament issue but must be done freely and without coercion. Regarding the Soviet Union's proposal to transform the Disarmament Conference into a "Permanent Conference for the Guarantee of Peace," Barthou believes that it is of far-reaching significance but should not cause the Disarmament Conference to lose its original mission. British representative Eden expressed his sincere gratitude to Barthou and Davis.</p>
<p>In particular, Eden said that Barthou's remarks on Anglo-French relations were deeply felt. Eden said that the draft resolution proves the solidarity of Anglo-French relations. Britain is eager for the Disarmament Conference to achieve results and is unwilling to engage in empty discussions for a long time. For this reason, it accepts the compromise proposal agreed upon by the representatives of the three countries and hopes that the atmosphere of the Disarmament Conference will be refreshed and that Germany will also return to Geneva. Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference caused the current difficulties and increased the danger to European peace, bearing considerable responsibility. With this compromise proposal, Germany can rejoin the work of disarmament. U.S. representative Davis said that countries must compromise with each other, so the United States also supports the new compromise proposal set by the representatives of the three countries. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov said that the Soviet Union was not entirely satisfied with the compromise proposal, but it did not contain anything that would cause the Soviet representative to object. Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler spoke on behalf of six countries (Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Spain), saying that he believed that the new compromise proposal set by the representatives of Britain, the United States, and France could help the Disarmament Conference and resolve it. Hungarian representative described his country's demands and made explicit reservations on the compromise proposal. Italian representative Surania reiterated his reservations to the presidium but also said that Italy is willing to continue to cooperate with various countries beyond formal and procedural issues in order to achieve a peaceful resolution to various major international issues. Bulgarian representative Migoff declared his support for the compromise proposal. The Austrian representative did not intend to express an opinion. Polish representative Rattesky said that the French compromise proposal eased the atmosphere of the conference and was deeply gratifying, and then reiterated his reservations to the presidium. Finally, the Persian representative spoke, and the compromise proposal was then passed by the General Commission without opposition. The 54 countries attending the Disarmament Conference, the General Commission is scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon to assign work. (Eighth Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's Concerns About Naval Conference: Does Not Propose to Cancel Treaty Itself; Repeated Hardline Propaganda Makes Britain and the United States Wary; Now Advocates for Conference to Be Held in Paris</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's attitude toward the issue of whether the Washington Naval Treaty should be canceled is most noteworthy. It is reported that Britain and the United States have held preliminary naval military conferences because they expected Japan to propose the cancellation of the treaty. However, the opinion of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the capital believes that Japan does not currently need to notify the cancellation first. Because if a new treaty can be concluded at the next disarmament conference, the Washington Treaty will naturally be eliminated. However, if the conference breaks down, notifying the cancellation will not be a missed opportunity. This issue has also become a research topic in France. Japan is paying attention to what attitude France will take. (According to Article 23 of the Washington Treaty, any country that wants to cancel this treaty must notify two years before the expiration date of this treaty, December 31, 1936, that is, before December 31 of this year). (Ninth Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding the issue of procedures for the next disarmament at the initial discussion of the London Disarmament Preliminary Negotiations, has contacted the Navy and decided on the following main points. Foreign Minister Hirota telegraphed to Ambassador Matsudaira in Britain, Ambassador Saito in the United States, and Ambassador Sato in France, and Ambassador Sugimura in Italy yesterday, instructing them to negotiate with the governments of various countries with the following purpose: (1) The Imperial Government advocates that the next disarmament conference be held in Paris, because naval disarmament has always been held in Washington, Geneva, and London. This time, Paris is considered appropriate. After Ambassador Sato obtains the recognition of the French government, Ambassador Matsudaira will propose it as an issue for preliminary negotiations. (2) The opening date of the conference is appropriate in April of this year when the London Treaty is revised. (3) The agenda of the next disarmament conference is limited to the relationship of the Washington and London Treaties, and absolutely opposes mentioning political issues, especially the Far East issues.

Those who attended today's White House banquet included Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito, Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, and Senator Pittman. Most of them are American and Japanese leaders. (Eighth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Colonies Boycott Japanese Goods: Malaya Implements Import Permit System; Jamaica, West Indies Increases Import Taxes</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Consul General Tamura in Singapore to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Straits Settlements decided to implement the import permit system from the 11th. Anyone who wants to obtain this permit must report the import amount from January of last year to March of this year, by type and industry, and the merchant ships carrying them. According to a survey by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after the implementation of this system, Japanese goods will be sharply reduced by an average of 60%. Other countries will not be so severely affected. In fact, this is differential treatment for Japanese goods, so it is clearly a violation of the most-favored-nation clause. Consul General Tamura called attention to the Straits Settlements government on the 8th. (Ninth Electric Communications Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Reform Plan: Hayashi Plan Is Even Broader; Content Strictly Secret; Naval Councilors Hold Important Meeting</h3>
<p>Since the inauguration of Army Minister Hayashi in Tokyo, the national defense and national policy that have become pending issues can be roughly finalized this month. In early July, it will be submitted to the cabinet and related cabinet members. Departments that can be implemented immediately will be asked to implement it immediately. Departments that are related to the budget will be included in the next year's budget. Although the specific content of the plan is strictly kept secret, it is enough to prevent the uplifting and expansion of the national spirit by reforming all kinds of current situations and to establish new strategies to help promote the uplifting and expansion. These new strategies will require various departments to specify how to concretize them. After all, it is the focus of national defense work. The departments that Army Minister Tai Hayashi's plan touches are broader than the plan of former Army Minister Araki's era, involving politics, economics, society, ideology, and other aspects.

<h3>Blockade of Bolivian-Paraguayan Arms: Japan Refuses to Cooperate Internationally, Declaring Itself Unbound by Alliance Treaties Since Leaving the League; Italy Will Participate Only Under Conditions of Equal Observance by Japan and Russia; the Ban is Thus Unlikely to Succeed</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is reported that Italy has agreed to comply with the proposal of the Song International to prohibit the supply of arms to Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, but only on the condition that Japan also complies with this measure. However, Japan has indicated that since it has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it cannot cooperate with the League under Article 3 of the Covenant. It is also reported that Italy's compliance with this ban is subject to another condition, namely that the ban shall not apply to existing orders. This condition will make the ban difficult to implement. (Reuter, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations sought the agreement of various countries on the issue of prohibiting arms shipments to Bolivia and Paraguay in South America. Recently, the Japanese Consul in Geneva gave an oral reply to Mr. Nachila, Chairman of the Three-Person Committee on Valley Issues at the League of Nations Building, stating that since Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, there is no need to submit a formal reply. It was also stated that Japan has no arms shipments to Bolivia and Paraguay and has never transported them in fact. It is noted that the Council of the League of Nations originally intended to establish an agreement to obtain the consent of all countries in order to implement the embargo. Now that Japan's reply is as such, this hope has been dashed. It is further noted that Italy has made a reservation on this matter, stating that Italy will only participate in the ban if both Japan and Russia participate. Although Soviet Russia has joined, Japan's attitude is as described above, so Italy will certainly maintain its original position. The Three-Person Committee now believes that if a small number of countries implement an arms embargo, other governments may follow suit. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Before the Corruption Case is Clarified, Saito Will Temporarily Maintain the Status Quo; the Military Urges the Government to Decide on Its Course of Action Soon; Ugaki's Meeting with Kiyoura Has Important Significance</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The truth about the corruption case involving important officials of the Ministry of Finance has not yet been revealed, and the turmoil in the political situation and atmosphere is increasing daily. Prime Minister Saito made a special statement to the press corps today, stating that the case has not yet been investigated, and the government does not believe that it is necessary to make an interim report due to the turmoil in the political atmosphere. Therefore, the government has no choice but to maintain the status quo. (Hualian, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) General Ugaki, the Governor of Korea, suddenly visited Count Kiyoura Keigo at 11:00 this morning. Both of them are important candidates for the next Prime Minister. Ugaki once served as the Minister of the Army in the Kiyoura Cabinet. This sudden meeting is expected to have great significance. (Hualian, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army authorities believe that the government's continued wait-and-see attitude towards the Kuroda incident at this time of political unrest will have a negative impact on all aspects. Furthermore, since the important opportunity of 1935 and 1936 is approaching, preparatory work must be carried out. It is hoped that the government will decide on its attitude as soon as possible. When Army Minister Hayashi met with Prime Minister Saito yesterday, he conveyed this opinion of the Army. (Nippon Dempo, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi's urging of the Prime Minister to make a decision is intended to provide the Saito Cabinet, which is in a wait-and-see attitude, with an opportunity to break the deadlock. The time for action is pressing. Once the truth is revealed, the Minister of Finance will definitely submit his resignation. At this time, if the cabinet resigns en masse, the idea that the imperial mandate will be issued again is gaining momentum. According to this, since Governor Ugaki has relations with the military and Count Kiyoura has relations with political parties, it is difficult for them to come forward. As a last resort, the imperial mandate would be issued to Interior Minister Yamamoto to form a cabinet. However, rather than doing so, it would be better to issue the mandate to Prime Minister Saito again. This view is most strongly advocated among the elder statesmen. (Denstu, 9th)</p>
<h3>Bandits Rampant on the Chinese Eastern Railway; Russian Director Requests Additional Guards</h3>
<p>News from Vladivostok and Harbin: Observers of the current situation urge people to pay attention to the following facts: The increasing rampancy of bandits attacking the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is consistent with a new movement to seize the railway's freight transport. Recently, a large number of bandit attacks have occurred on the eastern section of the railway. The Director of the Railway Bureau, Rodi, has applied to the Commander of the Railway Protection Corps, explaining the need to increase guards on the eastern section. However, the Commander has never taken measures to protect the railway, and the railway still has to spend millions of dollars to feed these guards. On the contrary, the authorities notified the Director a few days ago that they would withdraw the guards escorting freight cars on the eastern section. If this is the case, the entire eastern section will be vulnerable to bandits, and its business will be greatly threatened. In view of this, Rodi reported to the board of directors, requesting measures to add guards. At the same time, the Soviet Consul General in Harbin, Slavsky, urged the authorities to pay attention to the abnormal situation regarding the protection of the railway. Slavsky also sent a letter to Shimamura, the Deputy Negotiator in Harbin, requesting that the railway be effectively protected in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the safety of railway staff and traffic.

<h3>Roosevelt's Message to Congress: Advocates Social Insurance System to Guarantee Domestic Security; Develops Resources and Relieves Unemployment</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today sent a message to Congress outlining a grand plan for social insurance, the purpose of which is to guarantee domestic security. He stated that there is a national plan to develop and utilize the nation's land and water resources over a period of years. President Roosevelt hopes that this plan will be endorsed by the current or next Congress. If this plan is realized, millions of acres of fertile land will be added to the country. The message also stated that the funds required for social insurance should be raised through donations, rather than increasing general taxes to meet the cost. The states should bear the majority of the administrative costs, while the central government should be responsible for investing and guaranteeing the public accumulation fund. (Reuter, 8th)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Authorities Decide to Implement Crackdown on Savings Societies</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to official news today, the authorities have instructed the Banque de l'Union Franco-Chinoise (Sino-French Savings Society) and the Wan Guochu Xu Hui (International Savings Society) to complete the necessary security procedures. The Sino-French Savings Society has already submitted 30,000 yuan in accordance with the regulations, but the International Savings Society is awaiting instructions from its headquarters. The government authorities are now determined to implement their orders. If the International Savings Society does not comply with the government's orders, it will instruct Chinese depositors to withdraw from the society. Currently, depositors are still making payments as usual. The Chinese newspapers here today all support the government's actions, saying that the International Savings Society has absorbed millions of yuan of current funds from Guangdong people. The current situation has placed depositors in a dilemma, as withdrawing from the society would result in considerable losses, but continuing to make payments would be in conflict with the government's orders.

<p>Nanchang correspondence: Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, arrived in Xun on the 7th at about 2 PM after taking the Tianjiang steamship from Nanjing on the 6th. He immediately took a special train prepared by the Nanchang-Xun railway to the province.

<h3>Provisional Regulations on Summary Criminal Procedure Draft</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan, according to the Ministry of Judicial Administration's report, states that in recent years, criminal cases in various provinces have increased, and in view of the central and local financial situation, it has not been possible to drastically increase the number of judicial officials, resulting in backlogs of cases in various courts and county governments that also handle judicial affairs. Defendants are detained for long periods pending trial, causing endless suffering. The Ministry, as its duty, has to seek remedies. Previously, it was considered that the procedures prescribed by the current Criminal Procedure Law were too cumbersome and should be amended to facilitate proceedings. A draft was prepared and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. However, the promulgation of the new law will still take time, and it is urgent to first establish a method for current emergency use. Therefore, a draft of 22 articles of the Provisional Regulations on Summary Criminal Procedure was drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and submission to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and passage, and then promulgated as a separate regulation. It was submitted to the 162nd meeting of the Executive Yuan, which resolved to "pass it and send it to the Central Political Conference." It was also submitted to the 410th meeting of the Political Conference, which resolved to send it to the Legislative Yuan. On the 8th, the Legislative Yuan meeting resolved to send it to the Criminal Law Committee for review. The original draft terms are recorded below:</p>
<p>Article 1: In cases listed in Article 8 of the Criminal Procedure Law, if the court of first instance determines that the defendant's confession during the investigation or other existing evidence is sufficient to establish their guilt, it may, upon the prosecutor's request, impose a sentence directly by order without going through the ordinary trial procedure.

<h3>Shantou Salt Police Open Fire, Causing Trouble; Arrest and Beat Patrol Police for Investigating Smuggled Salt; One of Chen Weizhou's Achievements</h3>
<p>Shantou correspondence: After the salt affairs system in Chaozhou was reformed, Chen Weizhou, the Salt Transport Envoy of Guangdong and Guangxi, immediately sent hundreds of salt police officers to station in the coastal salt-producing counties. Carrying new and sharp firearms, they went everywhere in groups of three or five to search people's houses. If salt was found, it was treated as smuggling, and they were arrested and heavily fined. People feared them like tigers. For example, salt police officers in Huilai County pulled out the numbered bamboo sticks inserted by the Field Measurement Office in the fields. When the field measurer came forward to dissuade them, they refused to comply and were beaten and seriously injured. For example, on the afternoon of the 3rd, salt police officers in Shantou City suddenly searched for smuggled salt in the homes of residents on Zhaoshang Street. Because they did not consult with the police and carried guns into people's homes to overturn boxes and cabinets, the patrol police came forward to intervene. The salt police officers were furious and accused the patrol police of protecting smugglers. They arrested the patrol police officers, beat them severely, and detained them in the salt sales office at the Chaozhou Bridge. The sales office is located at the light railway station on Zhongma Road, and Zhaoshang Street is under the jurisdiction of the Fourth Public Security Bureau. The Fourth Public Security Bureau is located in the alley opposite the sales office. When the patrol police officer was arrested, the Fourth Public Security Bureau knew about it. They came forward to negotiate unsuccessfully. At that time, a salt inspector was in the alley, and the Fourth Public Security Bureau arrested him in retaliation. This happened at 4 PM on the 3rd. As a result, both sides were on high alert. At about 6 PM, both sides took hostile actions, and gunfire broke out. It lasted for an hour. As a result, a policeman of the Fourth Public Security Bureau was killed, and all the policemen scattered from the roofs. Later, the Public Security Bureau sent security teams, detective teams, and formal garrison troops to open fire to stop the salt police officers at the sales office. The salt police captain was arrested, and the salt police guns were confiscated. The storm then subsided. At that time, the citizens did not know the truth. They suddenly heard gunfire and mistakenly thought that enemy troops had invaded Shantou. They were all frightened because rumors had been rampant in recent days. After the citizens understood the situation, they all deeply hated the power of the salt police. (4th)</p>
<h3>The Rampant Bandit Situation in Chaozhou and Meizhou</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The bandit gangs in Chaozhou and Meizhou have recently become restless again. A large group of soldiers recently gathered in the deep and densely forested areas of the Eight Villages Mountains, Monkey Slide Rock, and Nine Dragon Zhang in Fengshun County, stretching for forty to fifty miles. These fellows are exceptionally rampant, openly carrying guns and killing the chief of the Public Security Sub-bureau, the village head, and the county magistrate. Chen Jitang has specifically telegraphed Deng Longguang, the commander of the Independent Fourth Division, ordering him to lead troops to be responsible for suppressing them. The Chen Xin battalion regiment of the Independent Second Division stationed in Fengshun is also under Deng's command. The police guard teams, armed civilian militias, and reserve teams of the eight counties in Chaozhou and Meizhou are all subject to Deng's dispatch for forceful interception. Fengshun is a crucial military area in the Eastern River region, and new-style trenches have been dug in three layers around the city, with numerous artillery emplacements attached to the city walls. Chen Jitang has given Deng a deadline to completely pacify the remaining bandits within the county this month. The provincial government recently appointed Liang Guocai, an adjutant of the Seventh Division, as the magistrate of Fengshun County. Liang is from Songkou in Meixian. He arrived in Fengshun by car from Mei on the 31st of last month to take over the county seal and posted an announcement of his assumption of office on the 1st of this month. Banditry is rampant in Chaozhou and Meizhou, especially in Fengshun. On the morning of the 26th of last month, more than twenty bandits suddenly appeared at the Shuiwei area of Xintang Market, on the border of Meixian and Fengshun, carrying a machine gun and other weapons such as Browning pistols. They were spotted by a woman gathering firewood on the mountain. After she reported it to the reserve team, the team, consisting of twenty-two men, purely voluntary in nature, patrolled in shifts during the day and guarded the blockhouse at night. The squad leader, Zhang Guocai, upon receiving the report, went up the mountain to investigate and was immediately shot dead by the bandits. The cook, hearing the gunfire, immediately rushed to report to the Sixth Guard Company of Xintang Market and telegraphed the training office. By the time the troops were assembled, the Shuiwei blockhouse had been completely looted by the bandits, with a loss of twenty-two guns and thirteen hundred bullets. When the guard company arrived, the bandits had already fled towards Langdang Rock in Fengshun. On the 30th, the entire Sixth Guard Company of the Training Office moved into Tou Mountain in Fengshun to search and suppress the Yangqian Pit area. This area fell into communist control during the year 1929. In 1930, it was pacified by Zhang Da's troops. Now, the remnants of the bandit areas everywhere are all stirring restlessly, spreading rumors and posting reactionary slogans. The bandit situation in Chaozhou and Meizhou is so rampant that it urgently awaits a large-scale military suppression. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Jiangsong: Frugal Administrative Expenses to Repair Sea Dams</h3>
<p>The ninth administrative meeting of this county opened on the 7th and concluded today (the 9th), holding a closing ceremony. Regarding the case of the dangerous sea dams needing repair, the expenses are estimated to be about 80,000 yuan. In addition to 40,000 yuan being allocated from the provincial treasury, there is still a shortfall of 40,000 yuan. It was ordered that methods be found to raise the funds. County Magistrate Jin once convened a meeting of various agencies to discuss this, and the resolution was to:</p>
<p>Assume three methods for raising funds: (1) Set aside a proportion from the frugal savings of the administrative expenses in the local budget, (1) Collect a few percentage points from the fields, (1) Advise merchants to donate according to the standard of business tax. This has been submitted to the administrative meeting for discussion and resolved to hand it over to the finance team for review. This review report was submitted to the meeting for discussion today, and it was resolved to use frugal savings from local budget administrative expenses to supplement the funds.</p>
<h3>Change of Head of the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team</h3>
<p>Since Director Zhou took office, the position of head of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau has been filled by Shen Jinyun, recommended by local people. After Shen took office, theft cases occurred one after another. Although some were solved, he also shielded soil merchants, gaining capital for concealment, leading to the large-scale activities of soil merchants. After the Water Police Team cracked a major case of soil merchants at the station, the fact that the team leader was shielding them gradually became apparent. The Public Security Bureau has issued an order to remove him from his post, and the vacant position has been filled by Li Zhao, styled Gongmian, from Jiangdu. According to reports, Li has been serving in the Anti-Smuggling Team and has quite a bit of experience in arrests.</p>
<h3>Nanhui: A Bloody Armed Clash Occurs in Huangzhen</h3>
<p>A bloody tragedy of an armed clash involving a crowd suddenly occurred in Huangzhen, in the first district of the county, at about 1:00 p.m. yesterday (the 8th). The cause of the incident was that Tang Yinlou, an engineer at the Zhongdinghe Hosiery Factory in the town, was seen by Yang Qiusheng, a local gangster, while he was harassing a female worker in a secluded spot a few days ago. Yang immediately reprimanded him, which led to an argument and then a physical fight. Yang, feeling humiliated, decided to gather his associates, including Zhu Xiaomao, to seek revenge. Yesterday morning, they quietly arrived in the town with knives, guns, and other weapons. Jiang Jinsong, a clerk in the town office, who knew Zhu, saw that he was leading a large group of people and inquired about the reason. Jiang, fearing that it would cause trouble, tried to dissuade them. By this time, both sides had gathered. After a disagreement, they immediately started fighting. Dozens of people were injured in the melee, and all the shops were in a panic and closed their doors. The town head, Yang Yaopu, heard the alarm and immediately telegraphed the Sixth Zao Bay First District Office, which relayed the message to the Public Security Bureau. The police team immediately dispatched many armed police officers to rush to the scene to suppress the situation, but the fighters had all fled. The seriously injured were carried to the public hospital for treatment. What was shocking about this clash was that even police officers from the Public Security Bureau participated in it. A Mauser pistol, three daggers, and an insignia were seized on the spot. The county government is thoroughly investigating the matter.</p>
<h3>Jinshan: Yang Shuyu, Warden, Innovates Equipment at County Prison</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Yang Shuyu, the current warden of the county prison, has made many improvements to the prison facilities. A few days ago, he drafted a plan to open windows, build bathrooms, and repair houses, which was submitted to the Jiangsu Higher Court for approval. The funds needed were all raised by Warden Yang himself from various districts in the county, with quite good results. Currently, each of the rear walls of the prison cells has been newly opened with an iron-grated glass window more than two feet long and wide, which improves air circulation and increases light. The planned location for the construction of the bathroom is in the southeast corner behind the prison cells. Once the Shanghai cement arrives, a cement bath pool that can accommodate twenty people will be built.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: County Magistrate Zou's Resignation Approved</h3>
<p>Wu County Magistrate Zou Jing presented his resignation to the province due to financial difficulties, which has been approved by the provincial government. Wu Qiyun, the secretary of the Department of Civil Affairs, has been appointed to succeed him and will come to Suzhou soon to take office. When County Magistrate Zou resigned, local gentry such as Zhang Yijun telegraphed the province to persuade him to stay. Yesterday, they received a reply from the provincial government, which stated, "Your telegram has been received and noted. County Magistrate Zou is capable in governance and we have relied on him. However, since his resignation is sincere, it is difficult to retain him. The provincial government meeting today has approved his request and appointed Wu Qiyun as his successor. Mr. Wu is loyal, honest, and capable, and will be able to seek happiness for the local people. We will provide guidance to ensure compliance. We acknowledge your expectations and reply specifically."</p>
<h3>Transfer of the Director of the Wu County Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Shen Weiyang, the Director of the Wu County Public Security Bureau, has now been ordered by the provincial government to transfer to be the Director of the Changshu Public Security Bureau. The vacant position will be succeeded by Wang Boling. After receiving the order, Shen immediately instructed the department to handle the handover procedures.</p>
<h3>Large Group of Lake Bandits Discovered at Huanglu River Estuary</h3>
<p>Four bandit boats carrying fifty to sixty bandits, all armed with guns, were discovered yesterday (the 8th) at about 4:00 p.m. in the Huanglu River estuary and the area of the east and west embankments, in Hengjing Township of the county, intending to rob nearby villages. The police brigade headquarters learned of this and immediately dispatched the First Company, divided into three routes on agricultural boats, to encircle and suppress them. However, the lake bandits were quick to learn of the news and fled towards South Taihu. By the time the police team arrived, the lake bandits had already disappeared far away.</p>
<h3>Five Family Members Heavily Suspected in the Wang Duosheng Murder Case</h3>
<p>It has been reported yesterday that Wang Jinsheng, the temple keeper of Maoshan Palace outside Limen, was brutally murdered and his body dumped at the river dock. His wife, Mrs. Pan, his son, Genbao, his daughter, Zhangjin (also known as Changxin), and his fiancé, Chen Wanquan, are all suspected. It is now known that Wang Jinsheng disapproved of his fiancé, Chen Wanquan, causing discord between the couple. Wang's nephew, Pan Tiansheng, had recently come to Suzhou to live with Wang and was also detained after the incident. All of them have been sent to the court for questioning and detention. During the examination of the body, it was found that the deceased's scrotum had been cut into a fishnet-like shape with sharp scissors. A pair of scissors stained with blood was found in the deceased's home by the police, which is naturally considered the murder weapon. Furthermore, the fingernail marks on the deceased's abdomen matched his wife Mrs. Pan's hand when it was pressed against them. Also, Pan Tiansheng's shirt and pants were stained with blood. Therefore, although none of them have confessed, officials have determined that all five family members are heavily suspected.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Appeal Against Forced Service as Jia Head</h3>
<p>Most cities and villages in the county are under the Yitu system. For silver tribute, a number of coins must be paid at once. The method is that each figure is divided into ten classes, which take turns serving annually. The one with the most fields serves as the head of the class. Zhu Quanfu, a villager from Caojia Alley in Figure 62 of the 15th District of the county, only paid 93.4 cents in silver tribute, while Zhu Jinfang in the same figure paid 2.277 yuan, Cao Juquan paid 1.796 yuan, and Zhu Xigou paid 1.658 yuan. There are several other households that paid 1.5 or 6 jiao. However, Tang Bingquan, the district chief of that district, reported to the county government, forcing Zhu Quanfu to serve as the head of the class and secretly allowing Zhu Jinfang, who should have served as the head of the class, to avoid it. The county government, without investigating, sent police to the village and summoned Zhu Quanfu to the county yesterday. Without asking for reasons, they immediately detained him. Now Zhu Quanfu's family members have appealed to all parties.</p>
<h3>Another Dispute Arises in the Rice Industry in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Five boats carrying soybeans from Changzhou, approximately 100,000 shi, arrived at the river in front of the Hengde Oil Factory in the west of Gongyun Bridge in our county a few days ago. While they were being unloaded, the Xinmao Rice and Grain Store in our county learned of this and believed that the Changzhou merchants were unloading goods across the border and seizing business, which not only disrupted the market but also violated ministerial regulations. (According to the tooth tax regulations, the rice and soybean business is divided into areas, each trading within its own boundaries. A trader who pays the tax in Area A cannot unload goods in Area B. This is customary.) They reported this to the Rice and Soybean Industry Association, requesting assistance. After receiving the report, the association sent representatives to advise the Changzhou merchants to stop unloading and invited Chen Jinli, the owner of the oil factory, to the association to discuss the matter. As a result, the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to invite representatives of the Changzhou Rice and Soybean Industry to Wuxi to discuss a solution. Yesterday, Lin Yibao, chairman of the Changzhou Rice and Soybean Industry Association, came to Wuxi from Changzhou to discuss mediation plans with Qian Sunqing and others at the county chamber of commerce. It was decided that until a solution is reached in this case, all goods already transported to Wuxi by Changzhou merchants should be stopped from unloading to avoid disputes. The Wuxi Rice Industry Association, fearing that the dispute would escalate, also submitted a report to the county government yesterday, requesting that the Public Security Bureau be ordered to send police to stop it.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Bandit Leader Lin Runlong Executed</h3>
<p>Lin Runlong, the bandit leader from the Erweitai in Wuyi, had previously conspired with Zhu Fugen and others to rob the house of Shen Jingkou in the 19th District, and resisted and injured the victim, Shen Minghua. He then conspired to rob the houses of Sun Qilong and Chen Hongfan, and shot and injured the victims. He was arrested and sent to the county by the 19th District Office in conjunction with the local public security police station. After repeated investigations and confrontations with accomplices such as Jiang Songgao, he confessed to the crimes. Apart from the accomplices Jiang Songgao and Zhu Fugen, who had previously been ordered to be executed by firing squad, the ringleader Lin Runlong was also sentenced to death. The execution was approved by the provincial government on the 8th. County Magistrate Cai immediately sent police to bring the prisoner to the court at 2:00 p.m., verified his identity, and took him to the Fengweidun execution ground to be executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: County Anti-Smoking Committee Appointed</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang County Government was previously ordered by the province to establish an Anti-Smoking Committee. The county government immediately submitted a written request for interpretation, stating that there was no Public Security Bureau in this county, and doubts arose regarding the organization. The provincial Anti-Smoking Association has now instructed that the head of the First Division, who is in charge of public security, should be a natural member. Furthermore, Fu Zhaoren, the director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, has been appointed as a member. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Ye determined that the number of county Anti-Smoking Committee members was fixed at five. In addition to himself and Ruan Yanying, the head of the First Division, as natural members, and following the appointment of Fu Zhaoren, the director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, as a member, there were still two members missing. Yesterday, he specifically sent letters to Li Renzai and Yao Qisu to serve as members so that it could be established as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Two Patrol Ships Transferred to Province</h3>
<p>Lin Junsheng, the captain of the Zhenwei patrol ship, and Wang Xiajie, the captain of the Jingping patrol ship, both of the Jiangsu Water Provincial Public Security Team, have been ordered by the department to be transferred to the Guazhou area of Zhenjiang to serve in the Fourth District of the Water Public Security Team. After receiving the order, Captains Lin and Wang sailed from Suzhou to Zhenjiang yesterday and went straight to Gua to patrol.</p>
<h3>New Cocoons on the Market</h3>
<p>The weather has been sunny and the silkworm farming is very good. New cocoons are already on the market in the eastern countryside, priced at over 20 to 30 yuan. The cocoon markets in the city and countryside are prepared to open their scales. However, customers have not yet arrived in the town to buy them. The Suzhou Provincial authorities believe that there are malpractices in the cocoon markets' purchase of fresh cocoons and the issuance of final cocoon prices, such as using small silver dollars in place of large silver dollars, and using copper coins in place of fractional currency. Strict measures should be taken to prohibit this. A telegram has already been sent to all counties.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Canal Water Rising Daily</h3>
<p>The water level in the canal has been rising continuously for the past ten days. The water level at the unloading wharf in the county was originally just over four feet, but as of yesterday (the 6th), it had risen to six feet eight inches. This is an increase of several feet in the last ten days. The water level continues to rise.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Canal Works Department Sends Personnel to Measure Yunyi and Huai Rivers</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei Canal Works Bureau, due to the tight summer flood prevention situation, specially sent Xu Guanqun to Yaowan to measure the Yunyi and Huai Rivers. Xu Bailu was sent to Bengbu to measure the Huai River, and they reported the water level and flow of each river separately every day. The commissioners received the necessary items at the bureau's office on the 8th and set off separately for their work on the 9th. It is learned that Han Zishi, a Jiangbei gentry who went to Henan to visit the Bian River project, has returned to the province by Jingpu train. After attending the provincial Anti-Smoking Committee on the morning of the 8th, he arrived in Yangzhou by the Zhenyang train at 6:00 p.m. and went to the Canal Works Bureau to discuss the fundraising for the Wanfu Bridge with local people. That night, he took the Yingzhou wheel north to inspect the canal project and water level at Haimen.</p>
<h3>Verdict on the Long Baohua Case</h3>
<p>Long Baohua, Ni Yongxiu, Zhu Laoer, Yang Bingquan, Wang Baoqi, and five other people from out of town were accused by Xu Gongwang in February of this year of kidnapping for ransom and forming a reactionary party. The provincial government ordered the county to arrest and detain them. During the investigations, the plaintiff never appeared, and his address was unknown. It was found that there was no such person. The county government now believes that there is insufficient evidence of a crime and should give them a negative indictment in accordance with Article 344, Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. After approval from the provincial government, they can be released.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Branch Details of Exhumation Case</h3>
<p>The Nantong Court Prosecutor's Office has not yet issued the ruling on the case of the unknown death of Chen Huanbao, a young girl from Lusi. There have been discoveries on the outside. Chief Prosecutor Liu believed that there was something wrong with the situation and suspended the recording clerk Shi Xianqin first. He also summoned the related people for interrogation on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Cotton Control Committee Members Arrive in Tong</h3>
<p>Four members of the National Economic Commission's Cotton Control Committee, including Yang Shiqing, arrived in Tong from Shanghai to investigate the current cotton industry situation and prepare to organize a cotton cooperative loan association.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Teachers Demand Salaries on a Large Scale During Teacher's Day</h3>
<p>The Education Bureau has been in arrears with the routine expenses of primary schools in various districts of the county for between one year and four months. The lives of the teachers are extremely difficult. On the 6th of this month, Teacher's Day, dozens of teachers from the first, second, third, and fourth districts elected representatives to demand salaries from the Education Bureau, citing the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar and the urgent need to pay off festival debts. They were received by Bureau Chief Huang Qingrui, who acknowledged their claims one by one. The representatives then dispersed. It is also heard that the Education Fund Production Association was established to plan the county's educational funds and is by no means a fictitious organization. The representatives are very dissatisfied with the Fund Production Association, which only knows how to issue funds at the request of the Education Bureau and will petition the association on a fixed date. Xu Qingyang, the standing committee member of the association, heard the news and, fearing that he would be embarrassed by others at that time, has resigned from the association.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Male Corpse Shot to Death Discovered in Shiyan Township</h3>
<p>A male corpse suddenly floated up from the water surface near the Wuhuan Cave Bridge in Nanluoxiang, outside the east gate of Jiaxing, a few days ago. Subsequently, Xiang Police Li Sirui reported it to the Sixth Public Security Bureau, which reported it to the local sub-court, which sent personnel to inspect it yesterday. It was discovered that the corpse had been shot to death, with three shots entering from the back. The bullets were identified as wooden-cased bullets. During the inspection of the corpse, another floating corpse was discovered across the river, which appeared to be a female corpse. Because it had not been reported for inspection, it must be reported before it can be inspected. If it is indeed a female corpse, it is expected that the male corpse shot to death died because of adultery.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: All Eastern Countryside Cocoon Markets Stop Weighing</h3>
<p>The silkworm farming model area in the eastern countryside of Xiaoshan had a fairly good silkworm harvest this spring. All cocoon markets uniformly stopped weighing on the 7th. According to the original quotas of each cocoon market, they all failed to collect enough, collecting a total of only about 312,000 yuan worth of cocoons, which is 40,000 to 50,000 yuan less than last year.</p>
<h3>Special Feature: Impressions of an Economic Survey in Guangxi Province (Continued) by Qian Jiaju</h3>
<p>Let me talk about the mining industry in Fu He Zhong. "Fu He Zhong" is the general name for the three counties of "Fuchuan," "He County," and "Zhongshan," which is the most famous mining area in Guangxi. The Guangxi Construction Department has an office stationed in Xiwan, Zhongshan. Xiwan is about 30 miles away from Babu. The office has its own truck for transportation. Anyone who wants to visit can simply make a phone call, and the office will send a car to pick them up. The director of the office, Mr. Tao Shaoqin, is a German-educated student with extensive geological knowledge and mining experience. According to Mr. Tao, Fu He Zhong produces the most tin. There are no fewer than 400 large and small mining companies in total. However, except for two or three companies that use machinery for mining (He Cheng, Pu Yi, Bao Hua, these three companies), the rest use traditional methods. There are several types of traditional mining methods. One is called "Long Kou," which refers to tin ore located inside the mountains. To mine it, a tunnel must be dug from the mountain opening. If there is a water source inside the tunnel to wash the sand, it is called "Water Tunnel"; if there is no water source, it is called "Dry Tunnel" (tin sand must be washed with water, so water tunnels are better than dry tunnels). Another is called "Zhuang Tou," which refers to mining tin sand on the open ground. There are also "Water Zhuang" and "Dry Zhuang." Some of these traditional mining companies have a large capital of up to thousands of yuan, while others have as little as several hundred yuan. Local people often raise several hundred yuan, buy a piece of land, and start mining themselves. Wages are not counted. The mined tin sand is sold to companies that refine tin ore. Generally, 100 jin of tin sand can be sold for 120 to 130 yuan, and about 70 jin of pure tin can be refined. The cost of 100 jin of pure tin (including taxes) is about 210 yuan. It sells for 220 yuan in Babu, 240 yuan in Guangzhou, and 270 to 280 yuan in Hong Kong. In the past year or two, due to the high price of tin in Hong Kong, tin merchants have made substantial profits, so more and more people are mining, and the production of tin has also greatly increased. Among them, the shareholders of several large companies that use machinery for mining are mostly overseas Chinese who have returned from Southeast Asia. They were hit hard by the economic panic in the world and could not gain a foothold in Southeast Asia. Therefore, they turned their attention to investing in domestic industries. These overseas Chinese are truly admirable for their spirit and courage. They are mostly stout, wearing old-fashioned short Western suits, and carrying a cane, running around the mining area all day long. From this, we can tell that they are overseas Chinese businessmen who have built their wealth through diligence and frugality. However, their harsh treatment of workers is also shocking. The "Rules of Compliance for Miners" in the Pu Yi Shi Ren Company stipulates that "Five days of wages will be deducted from each worker's salary as a deposit. If they leave without notice, it will be confiscated." The Bao Hua Company stipulates in the "Treatment Rules for Miners" that "If a worker resigns without reason and has not worked for seven days, their wages may not be paid. If they die due to work, the factory will provide 10 yuan for funeral expenses and compensation equal to 100 days' wages." Speaking of the lives of the workers, they are truly worse off than prisoners in Beiping. They live in the most dilapidated and filthy dormitories. The only difference between these dormitories and prisons is that prisons mostly have solid walls, while theirs are cardboard prisons pasted with torn newspapers. Prison windows are tightly closed, while theirs are wide open. Eight or nine out of ten workers are single men with no families. When mining, they are completely naked, with only a piece of torn cloth wrapped around their abdomen, as ragged as beggars, but much dirtier. As for hygiene facilities and safety precautions in the mining area, there is no need to mention them at all. Moreover, it is our belief that if they have mortality records, we believe that the mortality rate of miners in Fu He must be able to create a new era, because the lives of the miners are constantly threatened by death. Therefore, they are superstitious about something called "Bao Huang Ye." This "Bao Huang Ye" is formed by stalactites and is located on both sides of the tunnel entrance. Before entering the tunnel to mine, they must burn incense and pray once, saying that this can prevent dizziness after entering the tunnel and ensure their safe return. This superstition cannot be understood unless we look at the workers' working environment.</p>
<p>In addition to tin mines, Xiwan also produces a small amount of coal. The coal mine extends westward and northward from Xiwan. The coal seam is about four to five miles long and about twenty miles wide. However, the quality of the coal in Xiwan is not very good, and the production is limited, just enough for tin smelting. Currently, there are four coal companies in Xiwan, all of which are tunnels. The coal mined is often all sand, mud, and gravel. Some cannot obtain even a jin of coal all day long. The scarcity of coal reserves can be said to be the fatal wound of Guangxi's heavy industry.</p>
<p>In short, the tin reserves in Fu He Zhong are very rich. Unfortunately, there are too many tin mining companies and too little capital. The government does not have a large-scale mining plan. As a result, only those small companies are allowed to use the most primitive mining tools, such as hoes, shovels, and chisels, to dig around in a chaotic manner. There is no system or plan. They mine some places with rich tin sand and abandon those with less tin sand halfway, splitting the best ore deposits into pieces, a complete mess. The places that have been mined and are deeply sunken are not filled in, and the excavated soil is piled up like mountains. It is like a piece of fatty meat, riddled with sores. When the ore is exhausted in the future, it will be impossible to restore the farmland to plant crops. The authorities cannot shirk their full responsibility for how to remedy this shortcoming.</p>
<p>We stayed in Babu for four days and left Babu on October 14th, taking a car back to Ping Le, and then taking a boat from Ping Le to Wuzhou. When the river water rises in May, June, July, August, and September from Ping Le to Wuzhou, electric boats can pass and reach in two days. However, in winter and spring, when the water dries up, there are many shoals and the current is rapid, only civilian boats can travel. Downstream boats take at least four days, and upstream boats take twice as long. When we returned to Ping Le, it was the time when the water was dry, and the electric boats were no longer accessible, so we had to take a civilian boat and let it go slowly. The cabins of these civilian boats are very small. The width of the boat is just enough for one person to sleep. The awning is low, and the waist cannot be straightened. We can only lie down or sit diagonally all day long. Sometimes, we occasionally run to the bow of the boat to stretch our waists, look at the green mountains and green water, and listen to the boatman rowing. This kind of time passed for four days before we were brought to Wuzhou.</p>
<p>As we said before, Wuzhou is "the Shanghai of Guangxi," the gathering place for import and export trade in Guangxi (as well as Yunnan and Guizhou). In recent years, import trade has greatly declined due to the bankruptcy of rural areas and the reduction of farmers' purchasing power. Export trade has been hit harder by the world economic panic, becoming even more unbearable. Under the double attack of rural decline and world panic, Wuzhou has become a scapegoat. When we stayed in Wuzhou, we heard cries of sorrow every day in individual conversations with merchants, in the Chamber of Commerce, and among factory owners and workers. They were all admiring the past, vaguely looking forward to the future, and disappointed in the present. The largest commercial firms in Wuzhou are Ping Ma Hang and Shui Mian Hang (agents who buy and sell on behalf of customers, that is, the so-called brokers in the north). These two firms have been hit hardest in recent years. For example, in terms of export goods, the major exports of Guangxi are tung oil, raw oil, and rice. In recent years, except for tung oil, which still has annual exports (estimated at about 100,000 dan last year, compared to 150,000 dan in the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, a decrease of about one-third), other products such as raw oil have been affected by Shandong raw oil, and the Hong Kong market has been completely occupied by Qingzhou oil. Since the 20th year, a large amount of foreign rice has been imported every year. The export of grain and rice has also been unable to withstand the impact of foreign rice dumping, and its sales in provincial markets have gradually narrowed, making it unable to gain a foothold. Of course, these goods are not produced locally in Wuzhou. They come from the Liuzhou, Fuhe, and Yonghe producing areas. Recently, the number of goods coming has indeed decreased, but even this small amount of inventory cannot find sales. When we traveled in Liuzhou, Guilin, Ping Le, etc., when asked about the reasons for the decrease in the export of local products by merchants, their only answer was "There is no price in Wuzhou." Now that we have arrived in Wuzhou, the answer we get is "There is no price in Hong Kong or Guangzhou." "No price" has destroyed Guangxi's export trade. Isn't this the best microcosm of falling prices and the world economic panic? Other things such as the heavy exploitation of miscellaneous taxes, the difficulty of transportation, and the high cost of living have all driven merchants into the abyss of despair.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss: Panchen Lama's Difficult Entry into Tibet Resolved; Ariyoshi's Visit to Beijing Did Not Discuss Sino-Japanese Issues</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 7:20 yesterday morning and went to the Sino-French Institute of Technology to handle school affairs. Reporters from the Central News Agency went to interview him and inquired about the following questions. According to him,</p>
<h3>Transporting Antiquities to Beijing to Build a Storage Facility</h3>
<p>Mr. Chu first talked about the affairs of the Palace Museum. He said that after arriving in Beijing, Ma Heng, the director of the Palace Museum, immediately visited President Wang and was received by him personally. As for the position of Secretary-General of the Palace Museum, it was assumed by Ye Chucang, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters. Because Mr. Ye has many affairs, he requested to serve concurrently. Therefore, when meeting with Mr. Ma, he discussed the matter in detail. As for the convening of the council of the museum, it is still in preparation. Because the council members are scattered all over the country, it is more difficult to gather them. Therefore, ordinary matters are decided by the meeting of the standing council members. The authorities of the museum,</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the storage of antiquities in Shanghai requires monthly expenses of 20,000 yuan, they all advocate building a museum in the Nanjing Mausoleum. The estimated cost is 1 million yuan, which will be borrowed from the British, French, and American Boxer Indemnity funds. Also, because the construction cost of the museum is huge, it is planned to build a museum storage facility first and then expand it. However, it is learned that people in Shanghai, such as Shi Liangcai, advocate building an antiquity storage facility in Shanghai to save expenses. It is still under discussion.</p>
<h3>Panchen Lama Will Depart for Tibet Soon</h3>
<p>When asked about the Panchen Lama's entry into Tibet, he said that the Panchen Lama is currently visiting various factories in Shanghai. The date of his return to Beijing has not yet been decided. Because the Lama's toothache comes and goes, he needs to seek medical treatment in Shanghai. He has now hired German doctor Dr. Noel and others for treatment. According to the doctor, the Lama's tooth root has a lot of pus and needs surgery to remove it all before he can recover. Therefore, he still needs to stay in Shanghai for treatment. As for the difficult entry into Tibet, it has now been completely resolved. Reuters previously reported that the commander-in-chief of Tibet, Long Mai'er, was killed. He personally knew that the Dalai Lama had a favorite minister. He was originally a gardener, but after being appreciated by the Dalai Lama, he gained the Dalai Lama's trust with his intelligence, so he arbitrarily exercised power. It is not yet possible to verify whether this person is the murdered Long Mai'er. In short, the obstacles have been removed, and all the people in Tibet warmly welcome the Panchen Lama to enter Tibet to preside over the government. Therefore, the Panchen Lama can start soon for Tibet.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Know the Truth About News from Southern Xinjiang</h3>
<p>The Xinjiang Construction Committee is currently holding group meetings. The date of the general meeting has not yet been decided. As for the recent situation in southern Xinjiang, due to transportation reasons, no reports have been received recently. However, it is learned that Ma Zhongying has now failed and cannot rise again. The province is located on the border, with a vast area and rich products, so there are many coveters. Japan, Russia, England, Turkey, and other countries are all eyeing it and monitoring each other. The successive rebellions in Xinjiang must have a considerable background. However, we do not know the situation because of the lack of communication. The various telegrams have their own functions and make self-interested propaganda to serve their own interests. Therefore, the news published in various newspapers is difficult to know the truth because of this relationship. Therefore, when we read the newspaper, we should first pay attention to the source of the telegram and collect telegrams from various parties for verification, then we should know the truth slightly.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong's Trip to the South Has No Task</h3>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, Minister of the Interior, went to the South this time purely because he had been away from his hometown for a long time, so he took a vacation and returned to his hometown. He did not undertake any mission. What the Japanese said should not be believed. The Japanese have repeatedly fabricated rumors, which are well known to the world. As for Japan's request to expand the concession in Tianjin and rent Sandu'ao in Fujian Province as an aircraft exercise field, there is no such thing. I don't know where these rumors came from. I hope that the people of the country will no longer echo the propaganda to encourage the Japanese ambition.</p>
<h3>Ariyoshi's Visit to Beijing Did Not Discuss Outstanding Issues</h3>
<p>Finally, Chu said that Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi did not meet with President Wang to discuss Sino-Japanese issues during his visit to Beijing. Mr. Wang hosted a banquet for the ambassadors of various countries to China yesterday (the day before yesterday), which is also held every year. The ambassadors will stay in Beijing for a short time and then return to Pinghu and other places. Russian Ambassador Bogomolov will come to Shanghai within days. As for the relocation of the British Embassy to the South, I am afraid it is a rumor and not confirmed. It is difficult to believe that the relocation of the British Embassy to the South will be realized at present. As for Gu Weijun, China's ambassador to France, and Hu Shize, director of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations, they will return to China on the Ganji Wheel on the 13th, not because they were summoned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Because Gu and Hu have been away from the country for a long time, they have specially requested a vacation to return to the country to inspect the domestic situation. This is also common practice for diplomats stationed abroad. Chu will return to Beijing by overnight train on Sunday night.</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Went to Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, went to Beijing by express train at 8:00 yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Ariyoshi Akira, the Japanese ambassador to China, entered Beijing on the evening of the 6th with Councilor Ariyoshi and Secretary Yokokawa to attend the banquet of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 8th, and incidentally visited President Wang to state his opinions on Sino-Japanese diplomacy. He has completed his official duties and left Beijing by special train on the evening of the 8th, and arrived at the North Station at 7:20 on the morning of the 9th. Wang Changchun, a specialist from the municipal government, and Japanese Consul General Ishii and others all welcomed him at the station. After getting off the car, he returned to his private residence on Bixun Road to rest. It is also learned that Mrs. Ariyoshi will hold a tea party at her residence on the 10th to entertain the ladies of the country.</p>
<h3>Yang Dezhao Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Denies Imminent Return to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army, arrived in Shanghai by overnight express train at 7:30 yesterday morning. Mr. Yang told a reporter from the Far East News Agency yesterday that he denied the report that he was about to return to Guangdong, saying that he currently had no official duties that required him to return to Guangdong. This trip to Shanghai was to take care of personal matters. After staying for one or two days, he will return to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Chen Gongbo Will Return to Shanghai; Will Arrive Tomorrow and Immediately Report to Beijing</h3>
<p>Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, and He Zhuoxian, Director of the Trademark Bureau, went to Southeast Asia in mid-April to inspect the industrial and commercial situation of overseas Chinese. The official duties have now been completed. He has returned from the Philippines on the President Jefferson of the Dollar Steamship Company. The local authorities received a telegram from Mr. Chen yesterday that he will arrive in Shanghai on the 11th and immediately go to Beijing to report to the Central Committee on the inspection.</p>
<h3>Chen Shaokuan Returned to Shanghai Yesterday: Tense Situation in Sandu Not a Fact; Xiamen Is Also As Peaceful as Usual</h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy, came to Shanghai from Jiangxi yesterday. A reporter from the East China News Agency specially asked about the current situation in South China in recent days. According to Mr. Chen, this trip to Jiangxi to visit Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, was to discuss naval affairs. As for the situation in Minnan and Xiamen in South China, it is very peaceful. What has been reported by outside parties is not factual at all. Sandu is also as usual. The saying that a certain party will covet the place is even more unreliable. The Naval Academy will open on July 1. There is not enough time, so when it will be established has not yet been decided. The Red bandits in Jiangxi only have a very small part left to be eliminated. It is expected that all of them can be eliminated in the fall. In addition, the newly built Chang Ning and Zheng Ning gunboats are scheduled to have their launch ceremony on the 15th of this month, with naval personnel throwing bottles. When the Naval Academy opens, officers without the rank of lieutenant commander or above cannot enter the school for research.</p>

Personnel have been sent to Germany to select and match them. After they come to China, a formal contract can be signed. Its contents may be revised on the basis of the draft agreement. (2) British Boxer Indemnity Bonds of 1.5 million pounds will be used as construction funds for the Yuehan Railway, which has been underwritten by four banks, including the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and HSBC. The draft agreement has also been signed. In both cases, it has been decided to issue subscription coupons first. When the Ministry of Railways needs funds for railway construction, it will issue them at any time. As for the formal issuance, it will be presided over by the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Journalists Association: Assists Xu Gongyan Newspaper; Cables the Provincial Party and Government Authorities to Handle the Matter Impartially</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Journalists Association sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, Provincial Government, and Department of Civil Affairs yesterday on the matter of the Xu Gongyan Newspaper being sealed. To the Jiangsu Provincial Executive Committee, Provincial Government, Chairman Chen, and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs: The Xu Gongyan Newspaper of Xuzhou was sealed and the president was imprisoned for commenting on county administration and offending Wang Gongyu, the county magistrate of Tongshan. Even if the newspaper's editorial violated the criminal law, it could be handled according to law. Such destruction of public opinion and trampling of human rights is tantamount to treating the Provisional Constitution as a waste and viewing the Central Government's circulars as mere formalities. Our association has repeatedly received telegrams from the Xu Gongyan Newspaper and journalists in Xuzhou requesting assistance. We dare to appeal to your government (committee) (department) to thoroughly investigate the illegal facts of Wang Gongyu, the county magistrate of Tongshan, and promptly handle the matter impartially to deter illegality and maintain human rights. We are very grateful. Shanghai Journalists Association Qing.</p>

<h3>顧馨一　談救濟麵粉原則確定　治標：實財鐵交四部負責解决　治本：官商合作力謀麥質改良</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports, regarding the matter of relieving flour, after the efforts of the government authorities and flour manufacturers, the important principles of various reliefs have been determined. Since the United States, known for its wheat production, has encountered a famine this year and its output has decreased, all parties are now seeking to salvage the situation. According to Gu Xinyi, a flour magnate in this city, the following are the details:</p>
<h3>Treating the Symptoms and Addressing the Root Cause Simultaneously</h3>
<p>According to Gu, I went to the capital earlier and exchanged views with the relevant authorities on the relief of flour. It has now been decided that this matter will be approached from both treating the symptoms and addressing the root cause. In terms of treating the symptoms, efforts will be made to reduce taxes and fees on transportation. The Ministry of Industry will consult with the Ministries of Finance, Railways, and Communications on this matter and be responsible for seeking a solution. At this finance meeting, it was agreed that the consolidated tax should be treated equally. Therefore, the flour consolidated tax should be taxed according to the grades of other goods. First and second-class flours will be taxed according to their grades, while third and fourth-class flours will be exempted from tax. If this can be done, the cost may be reduced. As for addressing the root cause, efforts will be made to improve the quality of wheat. In various wheat-producing areas, mud and sand are often mixed in to increase the weight. Such a trick must be fundamentally improved. The above matters will be improved by local governments and grain merchants.</p>
<h3>The American Wheat Famine May Raise Prices</h3>
<p>The biggest reason for the slump in the flour market is the oversupply. The reason for the oversupply is the dumping of foreign wheat in the country. In recent years, the import of American wheat has been alarmingly high, causing domestic wheat sales to stagnate. It is now reported that the American wheat-producing region has suffered a disaster, and its output has been greatly reduced, less than half of what it was in previous years. Therefore, it is expected that the American wheat market may increase prices. If so, American wheat may stop being transported to China. If American wheat no longer comes to China, and domestic wheat can be relieved of tax and freight burdens, the flour business will have a chance to recover. The reporter then asked whether the recent strikes in the United States, which have caused the suspension of the shipment of wheat flour borrowed from the United States, have any impact on China's wheat flour market. The answer was that the reason why China's flour manufacturers are in today's depression is largely due to the import of American flour. However, at that time, what China negotiated with the American authorities was only wheat. The matter of flour was not mentioned at first. Later, because American flour manufacturers generally felt a lack of raw materials because the government only exported wheat, and the workers of general flour mills might lose their jobs as a result, they requested the government to allocate flour loans. After several negotiations, it was reduced to 40%. As for the American suspension of transportation due to strikes, it is only a temporary matter. We cannot be optimistic about it. However, since the United States is affected by the wheat famine, if it can stop the shipment of wheat flour to China, China's wheat flour market will have a turnaround. However, since the Northeast was seized by the Japanese, because that place was originally the largest market for the sale of flour in China, although a very small number of flour is now transported there for sale, everything is controlled by the Japanese. This is the fatal injury to China's flour industry.</p>
<h3>No News of Guangdong's Agricultural Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The reporter further inquired about the report that Guangdong will start collecting agricultural tax on the 16th of this month, so there have been large transactions of grain by the Guangdong merchants in Shanghai. Gu said that he had not heard of this matter, but the Guangdong provincial authorities had collected a fertilizer tax. This tax was originally used to transfer the construction funds of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong. As a result, a large number of bean cakes transported from this city were detained in Guangdong due to tax issues. After repeated proofs from various parties, Chen Jitang also asked Yang Dezhao, a representative, to telegraph for relief. The merchants also telegraphed Zou Lu, the president of Sun Yat-sen University, to consider the difficulties of the merchants. The Guangdong provincial authorities agreed to exempt all fertilizer taxes on domestically produced bean cakes entering Guangdong. As for the reported agricultural tax, it may have been a misrepresentation of this matter. Recently, there have been no so-called large transactions of grains in the grain market. Everything is the same as usual.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Relays Order to Subordinates to Reiterate the Protection of Journalists</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports, The Municipal Government of this city recently relayed an order to its subordinates to reiterate the document on protecting journalists, which reads: "Approved Internal Affairs Ministry Police Letter No. 1063, which opened, 'Approved Executive Yuan Secretariat Letter No. 1972, which opened, 'Received the President's instruction, the Central Secretariat's letter submitted by the National Government, requesting the reiteration of the order to protect journalists, should be handed over to the Internal Affairs and Military Affairs Ministries,' etc. Copy attached original documents, forwarded for information," etc. Approved this. It is found that the Executive Yuan Training Order No. 3921 was previously received, which was transferred by the Central Government on the Jiang Su Provincial Party Department's request to protect journalists, and the order was followed. The Ministry then requested investigation and compliance with Police Letter No. 2265, and ordered subordinates to comply. Now it is approved to transfer the Central Propaganda Committee, which convened a news propaganda conference this time. According to the Jiangxi Provincial Party Department, the resolution of the case of guaranteeing the safety of journalists was submitted to the Central Government to transfer a letter from the National Government, reiterating the order to protect journalists. It should be re-emphasized that the previous order should be strictly protected so that the news industry can develop. In addition to sending and replying and informing the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, the original attached copy letter and proposal are copied, and the subordinates are ordered to follow the order as a whole. This order, a total of original copy letter and proposal are copied, Mayor Wu Tiecheng."</p>
<h3>宋子文访孔祥熙　會商建設銀公司事宜　將晋京開經委會常會</h3>
<p>National Economic Commission Standing Committee member Song Ziwen, accompanied by Song Ziliang, general manager of the China Construction Bank, drove to visit Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi at 9:00 yesterday morning to discuss matters related to the establishment of the bank. He left at 10:00 and went to the company in the Mainland Building to handle official business. It is also reported that Song will go to Beijing before the 15th to convene a regular meeting of the Economic Commission to discuss the future work of the commission and report on the situation of the Northwest inspection.</p>
<h3>市商會電中政會　請免芝麻出口稅　體察商情准其减免</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Central Political Council yesterday, saying, "The Nanjing Central Political Council: On the 8th of this month, we received a letter from the Association of the Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry, stating that according to letters from the Grain Merchants and Yuantang, on May 26th, it was reported that the Executive Yuan had passed the principle of reducing export tax rates on domestic goods, and it was said that it had been submitted to the Central Political Council for deliberation," etc. It can be seen that the government's intention to encourage the export of domestic goods and develop international trade is realized. The so-called revitalization of rural areas and relief of industry and commerce will be visible here. Sesame is a major local product in Lu, Yu, Wan, Su, Xiang, and E provinces. Domestic demand is actually small, and exports have always been the main business. Shanghai's exports, at their peak, were about 50,000 tons per year, and they had long occupied a position in international trade. Down to today, it has plummeted, and the export volume is less than one-tenth, which has a significant impact on the rural economy. This time, the Executive Yuan passed the reduction of export tax rates on domestic goods, and sesame is a major export local product, which is expected to be included in the comprehensive collection. However, for the sake of preparation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is requested to quickly telegraph the Central Political Council to consider the principle of export tax rates on domestic goods, and to give priority to the reduction of sesame export tax, etc. Based on this, it should be prepared and forwarded, and it is hoped that it will be approved as requested, which is really a public friendship, etc." It is found that this matter was previously on April 29, by the Association to request that the export and transit taxes on raw peanuts and raw sesame oil be completely exempted. After the affiliated association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, it was approved by the Ministry that the tax rates on peanut kernels and peanut oil would each be reduced by six-tenths for those transported overseas within three months, from May 26 to August 25 of this year. The sesame item was not discussed for reduction. Now, it is claimed that sesame exports were about 50,000 tons per year at their peak, and the current sales are less than one-tenth. After verifying the situation, it is really necessary to reduce and exempt export taxes and provide assistance. It is fortunate that the reduction of export tariffs is under consideration by the council, and the business situation cannot be understood and considered comprehensively. It is urgent to telegraph for approval, and it is hoped that the export tax on sesame will also be included in the reduction and exemption, and handed over to the competent departments for handling separately, which is really for the public convenience. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>第二特區市民會　請免查商號旗幟　昨函法領事等交涉</h3>
<p>The Citizens' Association of the Second Special District of this city, regarding the matter of the French Police checking the flag licenses of commercial firms, specially sent letters to the French Consul General and the Bureau of Public Works of the French Concession yesterday to make representations. The original letter said, "To whom it may concern, according to a letter from the Second District Branch of the Association, regarding reports from more than 100 commercial firms such as Fuxing, Dechangxiang, Gongping, and Sino-American on Fa Da Ma Road, the French Bureau of Public Works recently sent Chinese and Western detectives to check the flags of the commercial firms, copy the door numbers, and force them to donate licenses, otherwise they will be sent to the police station for punishment, requesting assistance, etc. It is found that there is no precedent for such license donations for shops hanging flags in the Public Concession, so how can the French Concession be unique? Moreover, at a time when the market is declining, it is necessary to ensure that other excessive taxes and levies occur. Please ask your association to make representations to avoid disputes and ensure the peace of mind of the people," etc. Based on this, it is found that shop citizens have fulfilled their due obligations for house donations and land taxes. At this time of commercial depression, the burden on merchants is really unbearable. Now the relevant police station is forcing them to donate licenses for flag meetings with no name and no reason, otherwise they will be sent to the police station for punishment. Such unreasonable oppression, the future of commerce, will be unbearable. Based on the above reasons, we hereby request your Consul General (your bureau) to consider the suffering of the merchants and quickly order your subordinate police station to immediately stop checking flags to avoid disputes and ensure the peace of mind of the merchants. Sincerely, to the French Consul General, (French Bureau of Public Works)."</p>
<h3>海關修正　進口米碎徴稅辦法</h3>
<p>Tang Hai'an, Supervisor of the Jianghai Customs, and Bolede, Tax Commissioner, issued Proclamation No. 1367 yesterday, saying, "In the case of the revised method of classifying and taxing imported rice fragments, Proclamation No. 1353 was jointly issued. Now it is ordered by the government that Article 2 of the revised method should include rice fragments without bran. To prevent confusion, it should be revised as follows: (2) Rice fragments with a bran weight of 50% or more shall be taxed according to the tariff for imported grains, and those with a whole grain weight of 50% or more shall be taxed according to the tariff for imported rice," etc. With this, it is announced to all merchants for their information. Special announcement."</p>
<h3>拒毒會　發表浙省禁烟成績</h3>
<p>The China National Anti-Drug Association received a report from the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Drug Association on the achievements of drug prohibition in Zhejiang Province, which was quite detailed. The association believed that since Lu Diping took charge of Zhejiang's administration, the ban on opium in Zhejiang Province has been strictly implemented, with remarkable results. Since the convening of the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Opium Conference in August 1932, which resulted in an anti-opium program, the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs have been able to implement it according to the proposal, and have dispatched anti-opium commissioners to various districts to investigate and eradicate it, so the harm of opium has been greatly reduced compared to before. Therefore, the investigation report is factual and is specially published as follows:</p>
<p>"Zhejiang Province from October 1932 to September 1933"</p>
<p>8,858 male offenders, 1,315 female offenders</p>
<p>5,527 opium offenders, 4,646 red pill and morphine offenders, etc.</p>

<h3>民運會派員來滬　調查英美烟廠工潮　與本市黨政機關商解决法</h3>
<p>The strike wave at the British-American Tobacco Company, with the stalemate between labor and management unresolved, and with recent clashes, the Central People's Movement Committee, considering the serious situation, specially dispatched the director of the Workers' Department yesterday morning to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the truth.

<h3>派報工會宣言　援助英美烟廠罷工工友</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Delivery Industry Trade Union's declaration to support the striking workers of the British-American Tobacco Company: "To all workers and compatriots from all walks of life, the capitalists of the British-American Tobacco Company, on the pretext that the workers are influenced by new ideas and do not obey the factory's command, have actually announced the closure of the old factory, prompting a strike in support of the new factory. It has been nearly a month since the event, and it has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. We, standing on the same position as the workers, cannot help but sympathize and regret it, and have no choice but to speak out. The British-American Tobacco Company has a long history in our country, and the money it has earned is difficult to count. Now, it has actually announced the closure of the factory for extremely simple reasons, putting thousands of workers in a desperate situation. Considering the friendship between labor and management and humanitarian considerations, the factory is indeed suspected of abandoning food due to choking, and is biased towards emotional impulses, and there is no important reason for closing the factory. Therefore, the British-American Tobacco Company should bear the full responsibility for the brewing of this strike. Furthermore, the workers of the new British-American Tobacco Company factory, in view of the closure of the old factory by the capitalists, held a mutual aid friendship with those with topknots and lost teeth, and launched a strike in support to promote the capitalists' awareness. The importance of its meaning and its reasons are very legitimate. It is also forced by the capitalists of the British-American Tobacco Company. In short, the British-American Tobacco Company, disregarding our country's laws and destroying the fate of our people, does not think of improving from a positive perspective, but only thinks of closing the factory from a negative perspective. We grieve for the thousands of workers of the British-American Tobacco Company, and we cannot help but feel sorry for the British-American Tobacco Company. We sincerely hope that the capitalists of the factory will quickly wake up and give a proper solution as soon as possible. As for the workers of the British-American Tobacco Company, at this time when our country's labor movement has not yet been truly unified, they can persevere and fight alone. We especially cannot help but sympathize and feel sorry for them. We now respectfully offer our ten million points of sympathy and are willing to be their backing. This is our declaration."</p>

<h3>Inland River Steamer Association Petitions for Abolition of Harsh Cargo Barge Taxes</h3>
<p>Cargo barges used by inland river small steamers have already paid fees and obtained licenses according to ministerial orders and have also been paying monthly donations to the Municipal Bureau of Finance. However, since June 1st, the customs office has also required the payment of tonnage taxes when cargo is cleared on these barges. This means that cargo barges in the same location are suddenly burdened with double taxation. This is not only unbearable for shipping merchants but also creates a conflict between central and local government policies. Now, as the government is in the process of abolishing harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies, all cargo barges are demanding the swift cancellation of this illegal overcharging of ship taxes. The Inland River Steamer Association of the city has yesterday submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Transportation, requesting the prompt removal of these harsh taxes.</p>

<h3>Nanshi Rent Reduction Association Submits Petition to the Executive Yuan, Requesting Approval of Property Valuation to Begin Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>The Nanshi District Rent Reduction Association of Shanghai, located in Yongqing Lane on Minquan Road, is a group of rent reduction branches in the entire Nanshi district. Since the rent reduction movement began, more than 80 branches have been established. Using stern words and justice, they advised landlords to moderately reduce rent. Fearing that some people would use the name of rent reduction to default on rent, they specifically published a statement stating that branches that have not registered with the association will not be involved. They are now actively working to seek liberation for the public. Yesterday, they submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan for approval. The original text is recorded below: "Presenting a petition for rents that are too high, hindering livelihoods, and should be reduced to relieve the suffering of the people. Humbly requesting review and approval and submission to the Executive Yuan meeting for special discussion and implementation. Since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai has suffered a great loss of vitality, and the market is in a slump. Those who are imprisoned for debt and the unemployed who become beggars are everywhere. Other problems include the difficulty in selling goods, financial stagnation, hopelessness of prosperity, and the danger of bankruptcy. Therefore, the masses have risen up to demand rent reduction to relieve the suffering of the people. However, most landlords hold the law as a protective talisman, and lawsuits fill the courts, causing complaints and resentment. They use the name of rent arrears to oppress the actual situation, resulting in seeking peace but feeling uneasy, and increasing litigation burdens before rent is reduced. People's minds are restless, as if a great disaster is imminent. The association is a group to reduce rents and cannot sit idly by and watch the city turn into ruins and the people become starving. However, to break through the difficulties, we should first seek a way out. Reducing rents is the only way to alleviate the emergency. Low rents mean lighter burdens, and lighter burdens mean the people's suffering is relieved. Once the people's suffering is relieved, the market can prosper, and the market can prosper, then vitality can be restored. Therefore, we have specifically collected public opinions and formulated measures, based on the Shanghai land price promulgated by the Shanghai Land Bureau this year as a benchmark, to calculate the land price, plus construction costs, so that we know the cost of the house and set the rental rate to ensure fairness. Therefore, we start organizing the Shanghai Rent Reduction Evaluation Committee, submit it to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for supervision and evaluation, and submit it to the Land Bureau to prove the land price, and hire Shanghai famous architects and carpentry trade unions to estimate the construction cost, so that we can understand the cost of the house and determine the rental rate. Only by adopting a compromise method can we maintain fairness, and then all disputes between landlords and tenants can be easily resolved. According to this method, landlords have considerable profits to gain, and tenants have no excessive rent burden, so we can coexist and prosper together to seek the development of the market. Therefore, we investigate and consider all requests for rent reduction in detail and impartially to seek mutual understanding between the two parties. However, the tongue is scorched and the lips are worn out, but it is difficult to return to the landlord's hearing. The pen is withered and the ink is exhausted, and it is not allowed to reduce it by a cent. However, rent reduction in the capital has already been implemented. What crime has Shanghai committed that it is still in dire straits? You are a veteran of the party and the country and a lucky star for the people. I dare to ask for your compassionate heart that is already hungry and drowned, and to issue a grand decree that includes the people and all things. Please consider the economic downturn and high rents in Shanghai and approve the proposal to reduce rents so that prosperity can be expected, the Republic of China can be revived, the Communist Party will have fewer opportunities to confuse and incite, and the citizens will have more hope of recovery. All the reasons for rent reduction, in addition to submitting a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and various organizations, we hereby submit this document for your review and implementation. We cannot help but wait for your order with apprehension. Respectfully submitted to President Wang of the Executive Yuan."</p>

Wang Yucheng received them. The representatives reported that when they signed the lease contracts with the management office, Wuhe Foreign Firm, they all had guarantors and would never default on rent or abscond. Why should the tenants' furniture be used as collateral? Moreover, many tenants who do not owe rent are also affected. They requested that a letter be forwarded to the court to immediately lift the seal. Wang expressed his acceptance and promised to forward a letter to the court to request the lifting of the seal on their behalf. The representatives were satisfied and thanked him before leaving.

<h3>Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Petitions for Ban on Prize Savings, Money Flows Out of the Country, No Different from Aiding the Enemy with Money, Deeply Hope that the Central Government Will Take Decisive Action to Express the National Economy</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions believes that prize savings exploit the blood and sweat of the people, and specifically presents it to the Municipal Party Department, requesting it to forward it to the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and other agencies. The original text reads, "Presenting a petition for the proposal by Ma Yinchu and ten others at the National Financial Conference to strictly prohibit the prize savings of the Universal and Sino-French Savings Associations. It is far-sighted and the evils are clear. All those who are concerned about the people's livelihood express their sympathy. We now humbly present the reasons, begging you to take decisive action as soon as possible,</p>
<h3>Prohibit Immediately</h3>
<p>to eliminate social hidden dangers and maintain the national economy. We humbly believe that the establishment of the two savings associations began in the era of the Beijing government. At that time, their power was very weak, and the government was also ignorant and did not pay attention to it. Later, their power gradually expanded, and people in society paid a little attention to it. However, at that time, the savings funds were only 20 to 30 million. Recently, their power has increased day by day, and the savings funds have increased to 80 to 90 million. Just take</p>
<h3>Universal One Family</h3>
<p>as an example, the total number of depositors has exceeded 130,000. The total amount of depositors is the whole association, and its monthly savings revenue reaches 1.6 million. On an annual basis, it is no less than 20 million, and the Sino-French association is not included. Why are these huge sums of money not the blood and sweat of our people? However, we allow foreign businessmen to manipulate and control them. Our government has no opportunity to supervise and intervene. If an accident occurs, the blood and sweat of these 80 to 90 million Chinese people will all be turned into nothing. We still remember the case of the Oriental Bank Savings Company</p>
<h3>Defrauded Huge Amounts of Money</h3>
<p>The blood and sweat of the Chinese people were all taken away. Moreover, its savings nature is no different from today's Universal and Sino-French. The overturned cart can be a warning, how can we not be terrified? This is one. Moreover, savings is a virtue and is also a way to promote national thrift. However, the two associations only use the name of savings, using huge bonuses as bait, inducing ordinary men and women to blindly join with the money earned from their hard work throughout the year, hoping to win huge prizes by chance, without carefully calculating the pros and cons. Even if they realize it, they want to stop but cannot. Otherwise, the savings they have paid will all be in vain. Those who can get it back will also be subjected to layers of exploitation. This kind of improper prize savings has long been strictly prohibited by our central government. The banks in our country that have handled this kind of savings have all been ordered to</p>
<h3>Stop Operating</h3>
<p>However, the two associations operated by foreigners have continued to operate in violation of the order until now. It should not be allowed to delay any longer. If it is not prohibited, it will not only harm the people's livelihood but also deeply affect legitimate and beneficial savings. The people have invested in prize savings and are blocked by a kind of luck. It is difficult for them to take care of legitimate savings, and even hesitate to move forward. Therefore, if we want to promote the true thrift of the people and seek the development of legitimate savings, we must resolutely and decisively start by strictly prohibiting prize savings. The so-called not blocking, not flowing, not stopping, not acting is the same. This is the second point. Recently, the rural</p>
<h3>Economic Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>The group is concerned about the concentration of cash in inland cities, and the prize savings funds of the two associations not only come entirely from the inland farmers, workers, and merchants, but also most of them are transferred and flow out of the country. Its impact and harm to our country's industrialists are innumerable. Today, the concentration of funds in cities can still be invested in the inland by the financial community for remediation. Once it flows out of the country, there is no capital to use the weapon of commercial warfare, how can the country not be poor and the people not be prosperous? This is the</p>
<p>Third, in summary, the facts are like this. The association dares not deliberately create dangerous discussions to alarm people. All the reasons why the prize savings of the two associations should be prohibited are presented for your review and approval. We earnestly request that you consider public opinion and prohibit it as soon as possible. This will be a great benefit. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>Collaboration of Local Bullies and Police Chief; Secret Red Pill Manufacturing Operation; Gross Illegalities by Public Servants; To Be Handed Over to Military Authorities for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Within a week, Director Wen Hong'en of the Municipal Police Bureau received as many as seven anonymous reports, roughly stating that Liu Zhizhen, a local bully from Hebei in Zhabei, had colluded with Yuan Fuchen and Wang Futian, police chiefs of the First Precinct of the Fifth District, and others, a few months ago. They had set up a large-scale red pill manufacturing operation on the overpass at No. 111, Delin Xili, Baoxing East Road, within the jurisdiction of the precinct. They hired many workers to rush production day and night, transporting the pills to various places for sale, engaging in both wholesale and retail of loose pills and lamp-smoking paraphernalia. Director Wen was greatly shocked upon receiving the report, as he was mindful of the strict prohibition of highly addictive drugs recently promulgated by Chairman Chiang of the Nanchang Headquarters Military Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>He felt compelled to thoroughly investigate and arrest those involved. He secretly ordered Detective Captain Lu Ying to dispatch a large number of detectives to rush to the address for a surprise arrest on the evening before last around 6:00 PM. As a result, Liu Zhizhen (39 years old), a woman named Liu Lin (45 years old), Yuan Fuchen (28 years old, from Hebei), police chief of the First Precinct of the Fifth District, Wang Futian (45 years old), petition police Shang Zhenjiang (38 years old), and Ni Bin (39 years old, from Zhejiang), and other six persons were apprehended on the spot. A red pill gun, a smoking lamp, and dozens of red pills were confiscated. They were immediately taken directly to the bureau. The next day, Director Wen summoned Chief Bao of the precinct to the bureau for a stern interrogation, but he swore to deny any knowledge of the matter. However, Director Wen, considering the gravity of the matter in relation to the prohibition order from superiors, and intending to punish one as a warning to a hundred, decided to transfer the case to the military authorities for strict handling after further interrogation, in accordance with the latest regulations prohibiting highly addictive drugs.</p>

<h3>Hongqiao Sanatorium to Be Completed Soon; Mayor Wu and Others Enthusiastically Support It</h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao of Xishan spent decades translating Eastern and Western medical classics, amounting to hundreds of works, advocating for the reform of medicine, and his contributions were immense. In recent years, he retired to Shanghai, focusing on literature and diligently studying ancient texts. His Buddhist Dictionary and Shuowen Jiezi Gulin Zhenxu Bian were successively published and have been recognized as extremely valuable works in academic circles. Last year marked the sixtieth birthdays of Mr. Ding and his wife, Madam Wang. His son, Dr. Hui Kang, and others, wanted to hold a birthday celebration. However, Mr. Ding, considering the difficulties of the times, strongly opposed extravagance. Furthermore, recognizing the lack of sanatoriums close to nature in the densely populated and bustling city of Shanghai, he chose a quiet and open area on Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai to build a state-of-the-art sanatorium to serve the needs of the community and leave behind a lasting memento. Since construction began, the project has taken more than a year due to its vast scale. It is now reported that the interior construction will be completed within the month. Mr. Ding has no particular hobbies in life, and this magnificent building, which will soon meet us, is entirely thanks to his daily thrift and frugality. His dedication to social welfare, growing stronger with age, is deeply admirable.</p>
<p>General Outline of the Construction: The designer of the sanatorium is Dr. Xi Fuquan, an engineering doctor from Qiming Architectural Company, and the contractor is An Ji Construction Company. The entire sanatorium ensures ample intake of light and air, and special attention has been paid to soundproofing and fire prevention. The buildings are all constructed with steel and reinforced concrete. A special feature is that all bedrooms face south, and each room has a separate balcony and hot and cold water pipes. In addition to various medical rooms, there are also facilities such as a social hall, dining room, library, music room, and sunbathing platform.</p>
<p>General Equipment: The operating room, dining room, and special-class rooms of the sanatorium are equipped with cold air systems in addition to heating pipes. The lighting in the operating room adopts the latest shadowless method. The X-ray machine has anti-vibration devices and is one of the most modern types. In addition, short-wave diathermy machines, sun lamps capable of irradiating sixteen people's entire bodies, and ultraviolet glass windows are used in bathrooms and special wards. All bedroom furnishings are made of stainless steel for ease of disinfection. In addition to hiring specialized physicians in chemistry and X-rays and experienced Chinese and Western nurses, the medical services will be entirely directed by prominent doctors in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Support from All Sectors: Mr. Ding's old friends, such as Yu Youren, Wu Zhihui, Dai Chuanxian, Ye Chucang, Gu Mengyu, and others, are all initiators of the sanatorium. In addition, President Wang, President Sun, Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Yu, Director Wen, Director Shen, former Mayor Zhang Dingfan, Zheng Hongnian, Du Yuesheng, and others have enthusiastically supported it, serving as initiators and donating various valuable medical equipment.</p>
<h3>Bao Shan Seawall to Be Repaired</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government has resolved to allocate 400,000 yuan to repair the seawalls of the three counties of Bao, Tai, and Song, and construction has now begun. A general office has been set up within the Baoshan Seawall Engineering Bureau, with Peng Yumo as the general director and Gu Houxi as the director of the Baoshan section. It has since been learned that the most critical sections of the Baoshan area, including Gu Longdun, Zhangjiazhai, Zhutoujing, and Beishidong, total 540 gongzhang [approximately 540 meters] in length and require 300,000 yuan, exceeding the provincial government's allocated 200,000 yuan by approximately 100,000 yuan. It is reported that the amount of money required for the Songjiang and Taicang counties is less than 100,000 yuan. The deadline for completion of each section is five months, and Shen Baixian, the head of the Jiangsu Construction Department, is scheduled to personally inspect the progress once a week.</p>
<h3>French Police Attach Importance To the Assassination Case on Rue Say Zoong; Ordered Reactionary Criminals to Identify Whether the Two Corpses Were Old Friends; After Opening the Coffins for Inspection, All Claimed Not to Know the Deceased</h3>
<p>Chen Fangruo, a native of Hubei, residing in the garret of a three-story building at No. 64, Shanfu Li, Lane 148, Rue Say Zoong in the French Concession, and his wife, Liu Jie, were suddenly assassinated at their home by two thugs carrying two baskets of loquats on the morning of the 8th around 8:00 AM, on the pretext of delivering gifts. Both husband and wife were shot in vital organs and died instantly. After receiving the report, the French police dispatched detectives to investigate the murderers separately. They also transported the bodies to the Tongren Fuyuan mortuary for examination. The Second Special Court was notified on the same day to send personnel to confirm the cause of death. As there were no family members, the mortuary took care of the coffining and burial of the bodies. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. As ordered, the Tongren Fuyuan mortuary coffined the two corpses that night and instructed carriers to transport them to the Nanshi Salvation Bureau in the early morning yesterday for shipment to the Tangwan cemetery in Pudong for burial. However, the police attached great importance to this case, fearing that the deceased were related to political reactionaries. Therefore, yesterday morning, they notified the Tongren Fuyuan mortuary to instruct the Salvation Bureau to send a small steamer to follow and intercept the coffins halfway, hoisting the two coffins back to the mortuary. Subsequently, the Political Department of the French Police transferred three reactionary criminals, Tong Shiduo, Liu Zhaoshan, and Chen Cihang, who had been arrested and sentenced by the Jiangsu High Court Third Branch Court and were detained in the detention center during the appeal period, to the police station. Detectives were dispatched to take them to the mortuary to identify whether they knew the deceased. After a thorough and detailed inspection, all claimed not to know the deceased. Tong and others were then sent back to the High Court Third Branch Court for detention. However, the police originally planned to move the two corpses to the refrigerated room of the mortuary attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour, preparing for a re-examination on Monday. Subsequently, it was decided not to proceed with this inspection procedure, and the Tongren Fuyuan mortuary was notified to collect the two corpses again and transport them to the cemetery for burial.</p>
<h3>Three Kidnappers Executed by Firing Squad; Before Execution, They Complained about the Hardships of General Prisoners; Not Enough Food and Frequent Abuse</h3>
<p>Ma Gensheng, a local kidnapper, 41 years old, Guan Afu from Yangzhou, 31 years old, and Ren Zixiang from Shaoxing, 39 years old, were charged with using weapons to conspire with accomplices to kidnap Madam Yang Ren on South Chengdu Road and Weihaiwei Road around 9:00 PM on October 24 of the 19th year of the Republic of China [1930]. On the afternoon of November 2 of the 11th year [1932], they kidnapped Sheng Yishao at No. 32 Shandong Road. On the morning of December 9 of the same year, they kidnapped Le Zhenbao near Yu Yuan Road and Hart Road. Le was the owner of Taichang Wood Shop on Nanjing Road. They hid their hostage at No. 911 Haig Road and demanded a huge ransom. After the case was uncovered, the Old Zhabei Police arrested them and transferred them to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, they were all sentenced to death, and the sentence was approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Yesterday morning, the execution date arrived. The police transferred the three criminals, Ma, etc., to the Third Criminal Court. Judge Shen Shanzeng presided over the session, and Mr. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, presented the case files, photos, etc., for inspection. The court asked the three criminals if they had any last words and sent letters to their families. Ma Gensheng confessed that he used to run a hardware store and had an elderly mother, wife, and daughters at home. He requested that his brother, Ma Jinfa, collect his body from the execution ground. Guan Afu confessed that he used to be a chauffeur and currently had two older sisters in the courtroom. He requested permission to say a few words. The court granted his request, and he told his sisters not to cry, entrusting them with important family matters and asking them to collect his body. Ren Zixiang confessed that he used to work at a money exchange. His family had known about his death sentence for a long time. He had a friend named Lu Jigeng who embezzled 100 yuan in introduction fees for a tea waiter's deposit box. He asked his wife, Zhu, to pursue the matter. He also mentioned that he owned some houses and land in his hometown, which should be managed by her. The three criminals all maintained a calm demeanor, stating that they should obey the law and die for their crimes of kidnapping. However, they complained that they were not given enough to eat in prison every day, suffering from hunger. There were also cases of inmates starving to death because they were not given food for various reasons. They also stated that two Westerners, Numbers 37 and 2, often beat the prisoners from time to time. They requested that the court find a way to provide relief to the prisoners through the Chinese government. Judge Shen instructed that Ma, Guan, and Ren be sent to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office for execution by firing squad, escorted by Chinese and Western police officers, along with case files, photos, etc., in a car to the Caojing Second Prison execution ground. After the prosecutor verified the identities of the three criminals, Ma, etc., he ordered the judicial police to tie them up according to law and carry out the execution by firing squad.</p>

<h3>Chen Qing, Inspector of the Municipal Police Bureau, Suddenly Attacked Last Night; Police Officer on Duty Shot and Wounded by Thugs' Accomplices; Chen Shot in the Chest, Condition Very Critical</h3>
<p>Chen Qing, a native of Danyang, 25 years old, an inspector in the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, went to the Hou Defu Restaurant on Guangxi Road last night around 8:00 PM for dinner at the invitation of a friend. Chen was dressed in a light-colored suit and behaved very elegantly. It was not until around 10:00 PM that the dinner ended and they dispersed. Chen and his friend went downstairs together, and each parted ways when they reached the entrance of the restaurant. Chen walked alone along Guangxi Road towards Nanjing Road. Unexpectedly, a thug wearing short clothes suddenly rushed from across the street. Seeing this, Chen knew something was wrong and quickly ran away. However, the thug already had a gun in his hand. Seeing Chen running away, he fired two shots at him, one of which hit him in the chest. Chen continued to run forward in pain, crossing Hankou Road, about ten yards, before collapsing to the ground, bleeding profusely. At that time, the Chinese police officer on duty at post No. 558 was directing traffic. Hearing gunshots in the street and then seeing a young man in a suit running frantically in pain, followed by a thug chasing him, he quickly drew his gun and fired, intending to capture the thug. Unexpectedly, there were accomplices on either side of the police officer watching. After the police officer on duty fired one shot, the thug next to him also fired three consecutive shots, all hitting the police officer in the legs. As a result, the police officer on duty also fell to the ground in front of the Mei Zuishi Shoe Store. The two thugs then took the opportunity to escape east along Hankou Road. By the time police officers on duty from Fuzhou Road, Nanjing Road, and other places arrived to chase them, they had already escaped without a trace. They immediately reported to the Old Zhabei Police Station and used an ambulance to rush Chen and the wounded police officer to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital for treatment. At the same time, they notified the Municipal Police Bureau and the police agencies in various districts to jointly track down the murderers. However, Chen Qing's injuries were very serious, coupled with excessive blood loss, so his life was in great danger. As for why he was suddenly attacked, it is not yet known. However, it is known that Chen was very capable in his work, and it is possible that he incurred resentment because of this, leading to this tragedy.</p>
<h3>Sailboat Collides with Ferry, Resulting in Drowning; Police Officer Zhou Hanqing Tragically Drowns; Night Ferries Should Pay Attention to Safety</h3>
<p>Around 9:00 PM the night before last, Zhao Fulin, a local ferryman of Dongjiadu Ferry, was carrying passengers from the Puxi dock, turning the boat back to Pudong, and sailed to the center of the river. Suddenly, a white sailboat came flying from the north, encountering the ferry. In the darkness, they were unable to avoid each other, and the front of the sailboat went straight into the front of the ferry. Three ferry passengers standing at the bow of the boat were pushed into the river due to the higher bow of the sailboat. In that instant, the offending sailboat was stopped by other ferry passengers. Meanwhile, they tried to rescue those who fell into the water. Two people, Yang Xiaohong from Shandong and an unknown person, were rescued on the spot. However, Zhou Hanqing (29 years old), a native of Tianjin, who was a police officer in the household registration office of the Third Precinct of the Third District in Pudong, drowned after falling into the water due to his large size.</p>
<p>The ferry owner, Zhao Fulin, and the ship's crew, Mao Lang, brought the sailboat captain, Chen Afu, and sailor, Li Chongde, along with the ship to Pudong, and reported the incident to the police on duty. Both parties, along with three witnesses, were taken to the Third Precinct of the Third District. First, the ferry side described the circumstances of the collision. Then, the sailboat captain stated that the owner of the boat was an Englishman, working as a comprador in Anli Foreign Firm. Today, the owner went to Minhang for a trip and instructed me to sail the boat back from Minhang at night. Unexpectedly, the disaster suddenly occurred in the middle of the journey.</p>
<p>Director Dong of the station, considering that the case occurred on the water, transferred both parties and witnesses to the Water Police General Team yesterday for interrogation. The offending sailboat was temporarily detained for investigation. As for the deceased, he was returning from shopping in Puxi at the time and was caught in a sudden misfortune, leaving behind a wife and two children, who were impoverished and extremely miserable. However, the police officer was not wearing his uniform at the time, but a blue serge long gown. The body had not yet been recovered as of last night.</p>

<h3>Xicheng Li Branch Holds Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>The Xicheng Li Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Association on Rue Massenet in the French Concession held an emergency meeting because the free righteous property bank, after the houses in the area were managed by the Yiyuan Company, coerced tenants into signing illegal lease contracts.

<h3>Resolution of Price Dispute in the Tobacco Exchange Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association previously suffered excessive losses in retail stores due to soaring foreign prices, making it difficult to maintain business. On April 29, it invited representatives from various industries throughout the city, and the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees decided to reprint the price list and distribute it to all stores for compliance. On May 20, the Fuxin Company mistakenly advertised the ten-pack of Holmes cigarettes for 160 copper cash per pack in a certain newspaper, although it was corrected in the newspaper on the 21st. However, the industry believed that the company deliberately sabotaged the market. The newspaper advertisement and the sentence on the ten-pack seal were deemed to be insulting and damaging to the industry's reputation. The association was requested to negotiate, demanding that the company apologize to the industry, issue a corrected statement in the newspaper, and replace the old seal. Ge Yunfu, the business director of the company, agreed to the request and immediately complied. The price of the Si Taifei cigarettes of Yongtaihe Company was also mistakenly published, and Hong Yisheng was elected to negotiate with them. They expressed sympathy. The letter from Fuxin Tobacco Company to the Executive Committee is recorded below: Dear Sirs, Due to the harsh wording on the seal of Holmes cigarettes, it has caused misunderstandings among our colleagues. We are grateful for your association's mediation. Our company will stop using the old seal and both parties can explain the situation. Our company, in addition to complying with the original agreement, would like to express our sincere gratitude to your association for its impartial mediation. The dispute has been resolved. The price list for June was approved for printing and distribution on the 5th, and all stores will be notified to implement it on the 15th.</p>

<p>Beiping Fortune Teller Wang Mingjiu Comes to Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Mingjiu, known as Little Kongming, is an accurate and efficacious fortune teller. Previously in Beiping, he predicted that Lu Gong Diaoyuan would be appointed Governor of Anhui within half a month, which later came to pass. He also predicted that Wu Gong Peifu should not use force in the Year of Jiazi, and the Second Zhili-Fengtian War indeed ended in defeat. In the 19th year of the Republic, he advised Yan Gong Xishan not to resist, but he did not listen, which also proved unfavorable.

<h3>Broadcasting Station</h3>
<p>Sun Shiying's Broadcast Moved Earlier</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Shiying, a scholar of Chinese classics hired by the Youlian Radio Station on Avenue Joffre in this city, has been praised by listeners since he began broadcasting the Analects. Recently, the broadcasts have been sponsored by the Pudong Bank and Mr. Shen's residence. In response to the opinions of the majority of listeners and the letters and telegrams from various firms and organizations, the original broadcast time of 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM daily was inconvenient for those with duties, as various organizations begin work mostly at 9:00 AM. The radio station authorities consulted with Mr. Sun, and with his agreement, starting from the 11th of this month, the broadcast time will be moved one hour earlier to 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM daily. After the Analects are completed, the Mencius will be discussed. Also, if there are public or private letters for Mr. Sun, they can be sent directly to Mr. Sun at the Youlian Radio Station, for the sake of unity and quick response.</p>

<p>The Gospel for Those Suffering from Gastrointestinal Diseases</p>
<p>A certain Western doctor in this city has been practicing medicine for over thirty years. He usually provides diagnosis and treatment for patients, and often achieves remarkable results, especially in gastroenterology. Whether it is a new or old, difficult or complicated stomach disease, once he provides diagnosis and treatment, it mostly heals within days. A few years ago, a certain pharmaceutical merchant wanted to buy his formula for four thousand gold, intending to make a heavy profit, but the doctor recognized his trickery and refused. His medical ethics are commendable. Now, seeing that the number of people suffering from stomach diseases is increasing day by day, and many are unable to afford medical treatment, coupled with the proliferation of mediocre stomach medicines on the market, he has made a great vow to make public his secret stomach disease remedy, which he has uniquely obtained, and give it to patients free of charge. Those who wish to obtain it, please attach two cents postage and send a letter to No. 3, Lane 548, Bazilu, Shanghai, and it will be sent immediately. It is said that requests for medicine should not be delayed, in order to prevent abuse.</p>
<h3>Calligraphy and Painting News</h3>
<p>Lingnan Tan Yunshan Gives Away a Thousand Books, Couplets, and Fans</p>
<p>Mr. Tan Yunshan, former secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Governor's Office, is famous in Guangdong and Guangxi for his Wei Bei calligraphy. In the tenth year of the Republic, he retired from politics and traveled to Shanghai, residing in the humble Shanghai area, not asking about national affairs, but using commerce as a pastime, and indulging in poetry and wine in his spare time. In the past, he served as an editorial board member of the Chinese Calligraphy and Painting Preservation Association's National Essence Monthly and as the editor of the Yangjingbang Newspaper. He occasionally painted for friends, and those who obtained his work regarded it as invaluable. From then on, his name became famous throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River, and he was hailed as Tan Wei Bei. His calligraphy is like charging horses and masts in the wind, beyond comparison in its soaring momentum, and like dew, flowers, smoke, and the moon, unforgettable in its charming form. In the twelfth year of the Republic, he met the old man Fan Fanshan, who especially admired his work and revised its ink tone, further enhancing his reputation. In recent years, he has been overworked and often feels weak, so he often avoids painting by pleading illness. Recently, because of the emergence of strange characters, which are harmful to elegance and make scholars at a loss, he has risen again and re-established his connection with the community through calligraphy, also with the intention of guiding later learners to the right track. He is giving away a thousand books, couplets, and fans. Each couplet or fan surface costs only one dollar for ink. If you want him to write the "New Life Covenant," each item costs two dollars for ink. The collection point is Chen Xiaozhe, Xianshi Insurance Company, No. 303 Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Shanghai. Items can be picked up in three days in this city and five days in other cities.</p>
<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>According to Shou Leng, the abbot of Xichi Temple in Xinxiao, Nanshi, and his disciple Xiu De, they recently read a report in the Shanghai Shen Bao on June 6th about a dispute between Jian Ci, the abbot of Xixin Temple, and the monk Xing Chan, which is not in accordance with the facts. After Xixin Temple was renamed Xichi Temple, it has been more than ten years, and it has been presided over by Shou Leng. Until the 19th year of the Republic, someone introduced Jian Ci to stay at the temple. Last year on the seventh, the monk Xing Chan suddenly came to visit. Since both parties were from the same hometown, they did not pay much attention at first. Unexpectedly, in the first month of this year, Xing Chan often came to entangle with Jian Ci. Shou Leng was afraid of being implicated and ordered Jian Ci to move to another place. However, Xing Chan still came to cause trouble, so Shou Leng reported it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Although Shou Leng does not know the truth of the case, the report misidentified Xichi Temple as Xixin Temple and Jian Ci as the abbot, which has greatly affected the reputation and rights of this temple. Therefore, please declare and correct the matter on their behalf. Accordingly, I am writing to your newspaper for your review and hope that you will publish this letter as soon as possible. Respectfully, Lawyer Ding Shikui, June 9th.</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Having read in your newspaper's local news column on page twelve of the third section of the 9th of this month, a headline concerning Bao Ju, the chief of the first precinct of the fifth district, being accused of dereliction of duty for押繳裕源里房客欠租 (unable to translate this portion) news, the content described therein does not accord with the facts. The rent collector Sun Longyi of the British commercial Guangdi Real Estate Company, because the Yuyuanli tenant Feng Buzhou owes rent for two houses, each with a monthly rent of twenty-three yuan, totaling forty-six yuan per month, for fifteen months, totaling six hundred and ninety yuan; Zhang Jinzheng owes rent for one house, with a monthly rent of twenty-three yuan, for ten months, totaling two hundred and thirty yuan; Yu Asan owes rent for one house, with a monthly rent of twenty-three yuan, for twelve months, totaling two hundred and seventy-six yuan; Jiang Shunfu owes rent for one house, with a monthly rent of twenty-three yuan, for eleven months, totaling two hundred and fifty-three yuan. Repeated demands have not been met, and there have been acts of violence that have interfered with public safety. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 4, 12 and 13 of the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Regulations, a request was submitted to summon Feng Buzhou et al. to receive the punishment they deserve. On May 30th, this precinct ordered the police to gather both parties at the pre-trial at twelve o'clock to persuade both parties to reconcile. Yu Asan and Jiang Shunfu and the plaintiff Sun Longyi agreed in court that Yu Asan and Jiang Shunfu would pay four months' back rent on June 5th, and the remainder would be repaid monthly. The two would continue to rent the houses and would no longer default on rent, and would find a guarantor to be fully responsible. Sun Longyi immediately approved and both parties completed their respective agreements. However, Feng Buzhou and Zhang Jinzheng prevaricated and showed no sincerity. Since the dispute between the two parties could not be resolved on that day, this precinct ordered Feng Buzhou and Zhang Jinzheng to post bail and come to the precinct at nine o'clock the next day to await verification and handling. The police were then ordered to accompany Feng Buzhou and Zhang Jinzheng to find a guarantor. They found one around 7 PM and were ordered to leave. Until May 31st, Feng Buzhou Zhang Jinzheng disappeared and did not appear. Although the police were ordered to summon them, they ignored the summons and did not appear. Subsequently, a letter from lawyer Song Shixiang stated that he was entrusted by Feng Buzhou and Zhang Jinzheng and ordered the police to summon Feng Buzhou and Zhang Jinzheng to appear so that the matter could be concluded as soon as possible. It was not until June 2nd that the police summoned Feng Buzhou and Zhang Jinzheng to the precinct, but they still did not admit to owing rent or agree to move out. This precinct then submitted the rent receipts to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Later, Feng Buzhou et al. filed a complaint in court. In addition to informing the court of the circumstances, the Public Security Bureau was requested to deal with the crime of falsely accusing Feng Buzhou et al. in accordance with the law. This is the whole process of this precinct's handling of the case of Feng Buzhou et al. owing rent to the Yeguang Company. Furthermore, the handling of this case by this precinct is based on the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Regulations and is entirely within the scope of police administration, and there is no exceeding of authority. Fearing that rumors are untrue and concern reputation, a corresponding letter is hereby sent, requesting you to review and correct the matter. Respectfully, Shanghai Public Security Bureau, Fifth District, First Precinct, June 9th.</p>
<p>Editor, Greetings,</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Sun and Yu handled by our precinct, the facts of the matter have been published in previous newspapers, and it is believed that the public has already understood the general situation. However, upon reading the letter from Pan Hongding, a municipal commissioner of the Gaoxing District, in the letter column of the 6th, his words are untrue, and there is nothing to do but declare. According to the letter, "On the afternoon of the 27th, Mr. Yu Junzhenhui, passing through Shagang, saw stalls set up along the road for gambling, obstructing traffic, so he stepped forward to dissuade them. Unexpectedly, Sun Fusheng not only did not accept the persuasion, but also argued with Zhu Hongchang." Persuasion must be gentle and direct, repeatedly explaining the various harms of gambling. With this gentleness, how could it cause a dispute? At the same time, why did Sun's dispute not directly involve Yu, but instead involve Zhu? It also says, "To calm the matter and appease the people, a reconciliation agreement was drawn up." To calm the matter and appease the people, of course, means knowing that one is in the wrong and being afraid that the matter will escalate, causing Yu and Zhu to feel uneasy. However, Yu et al. claimed on the day that they were acting on the explicit orders of the mayor to investigate the New Life Movement and crack down on smoking and gambling in various places. If there was indeed stall-setting for gambling on the day, they could have notified the precinct chief and police to assist in the crackdown at any time to rectify customs. The precinct should have severely punished this act of kindness. Why did Mr. Pan come up with this bitter plan to calm the matter and appease the people? Now that we have removed Sun Fusheng's gambling and cracked down on it, at the same time, we are afraid that the matter cannot be justified, so we come up with a way to calm the matter and appease the people. There may be other reasons for this. As for ordering the police to summon Yu the next day, it was because Sun came to the precinct to request that Yu Zhenhui et al. be held accountable for the medical expenses that had been admitted to have been inflicted by assault, but Yu did not arrive. This situation has already been recorded in previous newspapers and does not need to be repeated. In short, this precinct handles local cases based on the confessions of both parties and detailed investigations conducted by personnel, striving for fairness and handling the matter according to law. There is no need to defend ourselves here. However, rumors confuse the public and disrupt social perceptions. I have stated these words to request publication. I am extremely grateful. I wish you well. Bureaucrat valve Shaohua, patrolman, Fourth Precinct, Third District, Shanghai Public Security Bureau.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>On the Contradictions of Life (3)</h3>
<p>In the past two days, we discussed the roots of the contradictions of life and the manifestation of the contradictions of life in terms of thought and thought. Today, we will further explain the contradictions between thought and action, and between action and action: The author emphasizes the following discussion on "how to overcome behavioral contradictions." It will be published tomorrow. Readers are especially asked to pay attention to tomorrow's conclusion. Editor</p>
<p>4. Contradictions between thought and action, contradictions between action and action</p>
<p>We often see a person speaking beautifully and writing beautifully, but when asked about his behavior, a dual personality inevitably emerges. We also often see a person's actions being inconsistent from beginning to end. These are the problems that this section will explain.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is particularly evident in the lives of modern people. Modern people mostly express dissatisfaction with the current society, so they can often accept a more progressive side in terms of thought, and oppose the rotten side. But in action, they remain conservative and cannot move forward, clearly displaying a dual personality. They sometimes feel distressed by this split and have tried to reconcile or overcome it, but very few can truly achieve unity of thought and action. This is undoubtedly due to their special living conditions. A philanthropist can only have some superficial sympathy, but he cannot live in poverty and mingle with the hungry. His understanding of poverty is not gained from real life; he is standing in the position of a spectator, feeling a little unbearable. Therefore, in the phenomenon of contradiction between thought and action, the development of thought cannot be completely denied, but it is bound to end when it develops to a certain limit (that is, exceeding his life's tolerance). Looking back at the Xinhai Revolution, we can thoroughly understand this. During the Xinhai Revolution, there was no shortage of people who accepted revolutionary theory, but those who could participate in practice were undeniably few. Especially for those who shared hardships with Mr. Huang Kecheng on that day, and later retreated, "I agree with the revolution, but because I am not used to a wandering, dangerous life, I cannot sacrifice so much, I cannot completely abandon my private life's happiness, so I cannot help but withdraw from revolutionary action." This is indeed an honest confession. In fact, people like this cannot be said to have a deep understanding of the revolution. They are detached from practice and speak empty words about revolution. Therefore, even if he is willing to delve into theory, the result will still have a certain limit, or he will turn into metaphysics.</p>
<p>When it comes to reading, we can also find similar phenomena. Luo Jun is a young man who loves literature. According to his letter, he often feels his own superficiality and wants to put in some effort in social science to deepen his understanding of society. However, his thoughts are like this, but his actions are completely different. He is not used to reading rigid social sciences, and he has no interest. This is naturally not accidental. This still needs to be explained by Luo Jun's life. Luo Jun's life is very comfortable. His dissatisfaction with the status quo and his desire to understand society are vague. He is completely living a leisurely life. He has developed lazy habits. His dissatisfaction is nothing more than a superficial stimulus from the current international situation and the Chinese national crisis. His real life, that is, his personal private life, is still safe and sound. He has never experienced the struggle of life, and naturally will not feel the need to acquire a set of strategies for the struggle of life. Studying literature was originally a pastime for him. The so-called desire to understand society is nothing more than a superficial impression, a temporary excitement. Some people may say that this is due to habit, but that is not the case. Even habit must be explained by the social living environment.</p>
<p>The unification of thought and action can also be explained by other social reasons. For example, take the common masturbation of unmarried young people. Everyone who masturbates knows the harm of masturbation. In terms of thought, they are probably all anti-masturbationists! In terms of action, they are just doing the opposite. This is a commonly recognized fact, and it has been typically depicted in Mr. Yu Dafu's "Sinking." This contradictory phenomenon is certainly related to physiological aspects. In fact, the creation of this morbid state still goes back to the social system (especially habits such as asceticism). Because this contradiction is clearly generated through social causes.</p>
<p>In addition, in a situation of excessive oppression or terror, the split between thought and action is often promoted. For example, in Western history, the Holy Alliance's great reaction and the Tsarist Russia's great reaction in 1905 caused many people to hide in various areas of life, causing their thoughts to grow in a winding way.</p>
<p>In short, the contradiction between thought and action is roughly caused by the insufficient leap forward of social practice and people's understanding, which causes the split between people's thoughts and actions. Thought often goes ahead, and action cannot catch up, as well as the result of many other objective reasons.</p>
<p>As for the contradiction between action and action, this can be explained by the leap forward and backward of thought. This is the most superficial aspect of the contradiction of life. We only need to look at the changes in social practice, and those that change with it. We can often see that some people are used to taking off one piece of clothing and putting on another piece of completely different colors. This is not surprising. People's lives are originally changing all the time. Even so, a person's change also has a certain limit. The thing that determines this limit is still the special social living environment in which the individual lives.</p>
<p>The above explanation is only for the explanation of contradictions, not for the defense of contradictory phenomena. We feel that a person's life is not afraid of contradictions, and it cannot be denied that there are contradictions. What we should pay attention to is being able to make a rational explanation of the phenomenon of contradictions. We should not only explain contradictions, but also change the unreasonable contradictory phenomena in life. We should use the contradiction of the life process and use it actively to overcome the contradictions that hinder our lives. Below, we will further forcefully propose how to overcome the contradictions in behavior that are harmful to the development of our lives.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Reading and Playing</h3>
<p>— Hanyun</p>
<p>Reading is necessary, but playing is also necessary.</p>
<p>Reading can increase our knowledge, and playing can gradually restore the brainpower that has been used up after playing, so these are all tasks that children need to do, but we cannot read all day long, nor can we play all day long.</p>
<p>Reading all day long can make our brainpower confused. Because of the confusion of brainpower, we cannot get any benefit from the books we want to read; playing all day long, even if it wastes our time, we cannot get any knowledge. Only by reading for a while and then playing for a while can we fully gain knowledge, but our brainpower will not be confused at all.</p>
<p>Children! Do you read or play all day long? Or do you read for a while and then play? This is a very noteworthy question, and you should pay attention to it!</p>
<p>But at the same time, children should also pay attention to whether the games they play or the books they read are useful?</p>
<h3>Selfishness</h3>
<p>— Long Shi</p>
<p>Little friends! Don't you love listening to stories? Let me tell you one!</p>
<p>A fox was caught by hunters. In order to escape the iron cage, its tail was cut off by the cage door. After returning to the mountain, it saw that all its peers had thick tails, and felt extremely ashamed of its own defect. If it could, it would rather have died in the iron cage. Finally, it came up with the best remedy: to convene a meeting with the purpose of asking the other foxes to cut off their tails like it did.</p>
<p>"This is unconscious," it said at the meeting. "My actions are now very convenient and comfortable. If I hadn't tried it, I would never have believed my words were right. Everyone says that a tail is an ugly and useless thing. Why do we all have such long tails? Brothers! Cut off your tails like me, and you will get many benefits!"</p>
<p>An old fox stepped forward and said, "Friend! I've thought about it again and again. You don't have to ask us to give up our tails. It would be better if you had the chance to grow yours back."</p>
<p>Little friends! The story above clearly tells us that selfishness can harm the public interest, and selfish people are enemies of the public.</p>
<h3>Summer Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Bo Zhen</p>
<p>The giant wheel of the seasons is gradually turning from the mild spring to the hot summer.</p>
<p>The enemies of people in summer – flies, mosquitoes, and all other microorganisms – some have already appeared, and some are still breeding.</p>
<p>People, the spirits of all things, are thinking about how to resist and eliminate enemies. This is called hygiene. This is something that all children should know.</p>
<p>(1) Personal hygiene:</p>
<p>Active aspects: Do not drink cold water. Do not eat food that flies have already eaten. Food must be placed under a cover. Do not eat overnight, spoiled food. Mosquito coils and fly swatters are also indispensable items in summer.</p>
<p>Passive aspects: Do not have dirty water accumulating in jars. Feces jars should have lids. If there are mosquito larvae in the water, eliminate them quickly. Install screens on all doors and windows in the house.</p>
<p>(2) Public hygiene:</p>
<p>Active aspects: Service-oriented social groups, such as youth associations, should pay a high price to buy dead flies. Buy fly swatters and distribute them to the poor who have no money. At the same time, establish epidemic hospitals so that poor people who contract epidemic diseases and have no money for treatment can receive free medical care in the hospital.</p>
<p>Passive aspects: In winter, people should be sent to collect the eggs of flies and mosquitoes and completely eliminate the eggs. Do not allow spoiled items, such as watermelon rinds and dead dogs and cats, to accumulate and be discarded in rivers and streets.</p>
<p>The above are all important measures for summer hygiene.</p>
<h3>Early Rising by Wu Yongkang, Student of Taicang Jiao Yan Corner Elementary School</h3>
<p>Get up early! You must get up early; get up to see the sun, the sun is a good color, see the moon is about to disappear, a curved line like an eyebrow, see strips of colorful clouds.</p>
<p>The patterns on each strip are exquisite, the flowers emit fragrance, the birds chirp,</p>
<p>I get up in the morning, wash my face, and carry my schoolbag to school. The teacher says, "It's really good that you can get up early!"</p>
<h3>"Mother Frog"</h3>
<p>— Su Su</p>
<p>Originally, Mother Frog was afraid of the cold and hid in a mud cave, not daring to come out. Later, Miss Spring knocked on her door, and she peeked her head out to look. "Ah! How beautiful! Miss," Mother Frog was very happy, and at the same time called out to the big frogs and little frogs!</p>
<p>Miss Spring was very happy and took the big frogs, little frogs, and Mother Frog on a trip to the lush green wheat field. As soon as they arrived in the wheat field, they saw Wheat Brother being bullied by many, many little bugs. Mother Frog was so angry that her eyes were like lanterns. She jumped over and swallowed the unfair little bugs one by one. She also said to Wheat Brother, "I will always be your guard from now on, protecting your health." From then on, Wheat Brother was very happy, nodding from time to time in the fields.</p>
<p>One day, Mother Frog came out of the mud field to bathe in the pond and saw many small bugs in black clothes with tails. Mother Frog thought, "These must be enemies that harm rice and wheat. She planned how to kill them." Unexpectedly, at this moment, the little bugs all ran over, shouting "Mommy! Mommy!" Mother Frog saw that they were all wearing black clothes and sternly said, "I don't recognize you if you don't wear green clothes like me!" The little bugs were very sad and sat in the pond, worried. Just then, Miss Spring passed by, and the little bugs asked Miss Spring, "Where can we find green clothes?" Miss Spring said in surprise, "Your feet haven't grown out yet, so how can your clothes turn green?" The little bugs heard that their feet hadn't grown out, so they exercised their lower limbs every day.</p>
<p>More than twenty days passed, and the little bugs' feet finally grew out, and their black clothes also turned green. The little bugs were very happy and went to the mud field to find their mother.</p>
<h3>A Deflated Rubber Ball After Being Heated by the Fire</h3>
<p>— Kong Jie</p>
<p>Bao Ge and Mao Di found a deflated rubber ball. Because it couldn't bounce, they couldn't play with it.</p>
<p>Just then, their older brother walked by. After hearing what they said, he put the ball on the fire to heat it. Before long, it had turned into a hard and bouncy ball.</p>
<p>After a while, Bao Ge and Mao Di ran back and said to their brother, "Look, this ball is even more deflated than before." As they said this, they handed the ball to their brother.</p>
<p>Their brother took the ball, smiled, and said, "I was just teasing you. Don't be upset. I'll buy you a new one tomorrow. Do you know why this ball became hard and then deflated after being heated?"</p>
<p>The two shook their heads together.</p>
<p>Their brother then continued, "Now, we know that everything in the world is made up of many tiny particles called molecules. These molecules are so small that even a high-powered microscope can't see them. When we put the ball on the fire to heat it, we are making the air molecules inside the ball move faster. When molecules move very fast, they inevitably collide and push each other. The result of the molecules pushing outward in all directions is that the ball becomes larger. However, at this time, some of the air is squeezed out and escapes through the small gaps in the ball. When the ball cools down, the molecules also move slowly, so the ball deflates. Also, because some of the air has been squeezed out of the ball, the ball is now even more deflated."</p>
<p>The two brothers understood the reason and nodded together. They happily followed their brother to buy a new ball.</p>
<h3>Fathers' and Brothers' Mistakes</h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>Years ago, I read an essay by Lu Xun, which said that Mr. Lu Xun had torn up a kite belonging to his younger brother, Mr. Zhou Zuoren, when he was a child. At that time, Mr. Lu Xun believed that flying kites was a useless activity for hooligan children, and as an older brother, he should be responsible for correcting it. However, after he read some books on child psychology, he realized that his previous interference with his younger brother was very unreasonable. In his middle age, he said to his younger brother, seemingly with a hint of guilt, but Mr. Zhou Zuoren had completely forgotten about it. The general idea of the article is like this, and the author further expressed at the end that all fathers and brothers in the world should correct mistakes like his. His intention is admirable. Before reading that article, I had indeed made the same mistake as Mr. Lu Xun. I had torn up many kites belonging to my second and third younger brothers so severely. But later I realized it, and I even criticized my second younger brother for following in my footsteps and tearing up the kites of my fifth and sixth younger brothers. Recently, there was a kite competition in Nanjing, and Chairman Lin and others had prizes. This shows the grand occasion of the competition. Why did Chairman Lin and others promote kites? There must be very sufficient reasons. From this, I would like to specifically point out that flying kites is very beneficial to the physical and mental development of children. Innumerable fathers and brothers in the mainland, please immediately correct that mistake of unwarranted interference!</p>

<p>The first steamboat was made by a man named Hull, but its machinery took up most of the space in the cabin, so it could not carry cargo or passengers and could only be used as a tugboat. In the nearly fifty years after Hull, the steamship manufacturing industry did not make much progress, but after a while, people in various countries became more interested in studying steamships. We saw the various experiments of the British and French, and we also saw Fulton's Clermont. Fulton was American. He made the first successful steamboat. The Savannah crossed the Atlantic in 1819, but it only used steam power for the first and last parts of the journey. The middle part of the journey was still sailed by sails. The ships that crossed the Atlantic purely by steam power were two British ships: the Sirius and the Great Western. They sailed from England to New York within a few hours of each other. From that time on, the progress of steamships was very fast, and their size was always increasing. Modern steamships are no longer comparable to the primitive and small steamships of the past.</p>
<h3>Water Bird</h3>
<p>— Shi Yusheng</p>
<p>Little friends, have you ever seen that kind of bird flying along the golden waves on the coast of the big river? They look so leisurely and comfortable. Little friends, you are wrong! They have extremely vicious eyes and extremely cruel claws. They fly lightly, but their eyes are focused on the heart of the waves: as soon as a playful fish pokes its head out, it is caught by a claw! They cruise on the waves non-stop, and the poor fish are constantly being slaughtered by them. Little friends, what kind of bird is this? This is the water bird that the enemy is using to carry out "water bird diplomacy" against us!</p>
<p>Little friends, the enemy is insidiously acting as "water birds." Are we willing to be fish?</p>
<h3>The Fiercest Animal in the Sea</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Speaking of the largest animal on earth, of course, the whale is the first to be mentioned. The length of a whale can reach thirty meters. However, once such a huge whale is attacked by an orca, it is useless. The orca is a type of dolphin whose sharp teeth in both the upper and lower jaws often bite the whale's body into pulverized bones and death. Orcas in the sea like to unite with their own kind, forming groups to specialize in harming whales. Therefore, when whales see orcas, they often desperately flee, mistakenly swimming to the seashore and being caught by fishermen.</p>
<p>The stingray's tail is like a serrated thorn, and the tip of the tail emits extremely poisonous venom. Coming into contact with this venom is fatal. When fishermen catch stingrays, they must first cut off their tails to prevent being harmed. Stingrays have venom to defend against enemies and serrated thorns, but they are no match for sharks or sharks. Because the sharp teeth of sharks and sharks can chew the serrated tail into pieces. This means that there are always stronger enemies, and no one can be arrogant or complacent.</p>
<p>Shipworms are even more dangerous than orcas, stingrays, sharks, and sharks. They are very small in size but can destroy large ships. They are called shipworms. The body of the worm is covered with a limestone shell. This kind of pest, regardless of whether the ship's body is made of wood or iron, if it is attached to it, it can gradually drill the ship's body into a honeycomb-like hole. Therefore, shipbuilders around the world have researched methods to prevent and eliminate them. In addition to wrapping the ship's body with iron, they also apply insect-repellent medicine. Barnacles are cone-shaped shellfish. These barnacles often attach to the surroundings of warships at sea, reducing the ship's speed. This is because the bottom of the ship is covered with layers of barnacle shells weighing dozens of tons. The ship's movement is therefore restricted. Although shipbuilders apply poisonous oil to the ship's body, the digestive organs of young barnacles are not yet developed, and no matter what kind of poisonous oil is used, they will not be infected.</p>
<h3>Village Little Friends' Correspondence to Send Off Spring</h3>
<p>— Zi Ming</p>
<p>Dear little friends:</p>
<p>Spring came hastily, but now it is secretly leaving. Its arrival decorated our earth very brightly and beautifully. We are grateful for it and welcome it. Now that it is leaving, are we just going to let it go silently? Isn't that too lonely? So, since there was a welcome at the beginning, there should be a farewell at the end, so as not to let down its painstaking efforts in building nature.</p>
<p>How do we express it? Poets and writers use wine and pens to bid farewell. We are ambitious and progressive people who don't passively do boring things. In the previous letter, it was said that "youth symbolizes children." We can't help but feel sorry about this! Watching spring come, grow old, and leave. Our farewell to spring only has a warm childlike heart, containing the deep meaning of "farewell." At this time, the only thing to do is to follow the passage of time and find our future broad road.</p>
<p>Spring has left, and the beautiful apricot blossoms and the fresh peach blossoms have long been taken away by it. The cuckoos are crying for it, and their sad voices penetrate the hearts of travelers. The god of thunder is also firing cannons, indicating farewell? Or anger? Friends! Can you tell?</p>
<p>Friends! The "spring" that cannot be retained has left! Remember!</p>
<h3>Small Fountain</h3>
<p>— Bai Yi</p>
<p>This is a very fun and simple science game:</p>
<p>Method: First, fill a medium-sized glass bottle with about three-quarters of clear water, and then plug it with a cork with a hollow glass tube inserted in it, making sure that one end of the tube is close to the bottom of the bottle; seal it tightly, preferably with sealing wax. Then, take a larger glass bottle and bake it over a candle flame for three to four minutes, and then cover it over the small glass bottle. Soon, we can see the water gradually rising and spraying out from inside the tube.</p>
<p>Reason: After the large glass bottle is baked on the fire, the air inside expands due to the heat, and then a part of it escapes out of the bottle. After the large bottle is covered over the small bottle, because the pressure is smaller, the air in the small bottle rushes out, and the pressure above the small bottle decreases, so it also sprays out, because water originally has a force that pushes upwards.</p>
<p>When we play this game, it is best to spread a few pieces of absorbent paper under the small bottle, because this will prevent the sprayed water from flowing in all directions, and it will also prevent outside air from entering the large bottle.</p>
<p>Statement: The author's name was omitted from the first article "How to Read Books" in the previous issue. After investigation, it was written by Mr. Gu Xuefan. We hereby declare it.</p>

Currently, the spirit of Shanghai's young students is very tense, which shows that Shanghai's youth are more aware than youth in any other place.

<p>He delivered an admonitory speech, roughly saying that Director Pan just mentioned that the Shanghai student military training achieved very good results. We received such good reviews and also won good prizes, which shows that the Shanghai student army is very glorious. Shanghai youth have been receiving military training for three or four years, with a pause during the January 28th Incident. Today, such good results have been demonstrated, which shows that Shanghai youth have a clear understanding of the country's danger and know that youth bear a great responsibility. I said yesterday that the youth of today should pay attention to both civil and military affairs. Civil affairs are about building the country, and military affairs are about taking up arms to save the country. If Shanghai youth can do this, then Shanghai's future will definitely be infinitely promising. Therefore, I hope that Shanghai youth will improve year by year in both civil and military affairs. In other words, the Chinese nation will be better generation by generation. Then, the Republic of China will definitely be able to rejuvenate, and China's thousands of years of culture will definitely be carried forward and glorified.</p>
<h3>Three Cheers</h3>
<p>Then, Director He led the crowd in shouting slogans: (1) Youth arm yourselves and avenge the country! (2) Long live Chinese youth! (3) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! (4) Long live the Republic of China, long live, long live! The meeting adjourned around 5 pm.</p>

The other was Jinan vs. Central University at the Central University playground, and the result was three to zero, Jinan won. The situation of the semi-finals is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Jinan wins against Central University. Central University is a well-established team in Beijing. Today, when they met the Jinan team, which has Xu Heng and other athletes who attended the Far Eastern Games, they felt inferior. After referee Lu Song'en announced the start of the battle, Jinan took the lead from beginning to end. In the first game, Jinan took the lead with eleven to five. After changing sides, although Central University tried hard to struggle, Jinan won the first game with twenty-one to eleven. In the second game, Jinan also took the lead with eleven to seven and won the second game with twenty-one to fifteen. In the final game, Jinan still took the lead with eleven to two and won the right to the final. This time, the Central University team's blocks were too loose, and the kills were not far enough, so Jinan's athlete Xu Heng took the opportunity to kill the ball. The three games ended in just fifty minutes.</p>
<p>Fudan wins against Jinling. Fudan is the volleyball leader of Shanghai universities, and Jinling is the champion of previous sessions in Beijing. When the two heroes met, the audience expected a bloody battle. The game started at 9 am yesterday morning at the Jinda Stadium, and the referee was Zhang Xinfu. After the start of the game, neither team would give way. It was difficult to distinguish between the two. Finally, because Fudan has famous Far Eastern athletes such as Qiu Guangxiao, Chen Bocai, and Li Fujun, their power is strong, and they defeated Jinling with games of twenty-one to nineteen, twenty-one to fourteen, and twenty-one to nine.</p>

Today, he was able to retaliate, winning two games in a row with six to three and nine to seven. Xiao Zheng's ball skills have greatly improved under hard practice, and his backhand stroke has improved even more.

He regained the lead with six to five. Wang regained the lead with seven to six.

However, Lin-Xu easily won three consecutive games at the start. After the fourth game, Pan's anger soared, and he cleverly regained the lead, creating a 4-4 tie. Old Lin and Little Xu refused to show weakness, and with a suitable combination, they were about to win with a 5-4 situation, but were blocked by Ka's serve, which led to a 4-4 tie, and almost lost with 6-5 and 7-6.

<h3>Conclusion of the China Table Tennis Competition – Lu Hanjun Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Table Tennis Federation's preliminary competition has been going on for nearly forty days. As of the night before last, the round-robin matches have concluded with satisfactory results. Lu Hanjun won the championship with 15 points.

<h3>Statement from the South Shanghai Basketball Association</h3>
<p>Since the Qunyi basketball team reported the dispute with the South Shanghai Basketball Association, the association has sent a letter stating the following: Dear Editor, Upon reading the news in your newspaper about the Qunyi basketball team's letter "Dispute with the South Shanghai Basketball Competition Association," we found that it is completely inconsistent with the facts. On that day, the Qunyi team and the Jianquan team held the final. The association, considering that in past matches between the Qunyi Jia and Yi teams, there have been repeated improper actions that made the opposing team uncomfortable, specifically requested Mr. Ni Xiaoben to serve as the referee and Mr. Wu Zibin as the inspector. The strength of the Jianquan team is far above that of Qunyi, with the score difference being more than ten points. However, Qunyi player No. 2, Zhu Jialin, did not show self-restraint and repeatedly engaged in misconduct. After the game ended, many players wearing Qunyi team jerseys broke into the office and brutally beat Mr. Wu, causing injuries. There are witnesses to this, and it is difficult to deny. Now, the team is blaming others for committing violence, reversing black and white, which is deeply regrettable. Mr. Wu has already filed a lawsuit, and the truth will eventually come out, and there will be a fair judgment. Other extraneous and unreasonable remarks are not worth refuting and are self-explanatory. This matter concerns the reputation of the association, so we have specially sent this letter to request a correction to clarify the facts and rectify public opinion. Sincerely, South Shanghai Basketball Association</p>

<h3>A Female Teacher's Hopes</h3>
<p>— Shi Yan</p>
<p>Today's children are the future masters of the nation and the most important people in the Chinese nation's rejuvenation movement. These national masters, who bear a significant mission, are now receiving moral, intellectual, and physical education in schools, preparing their strong bodies, noble personalities, and productive skills. The nation's prosperity or decline in the future depends on the effectiveness of the current school education. The prerequisites for increasing the effectiveness of school education are a beautiful school environment, sufficient funding, appropriate teaching materials, and good teachers. The first three are inanimate, and only teachers are animate. Therefore, the transformation of the environment, the allocation of funds, and the selection of teaching materials all rely on animate teachers. From this perspective, the responsibility of teachers is extremely significant!</p>
<p>As for the current life of teachers? Let's take a look at Shanghai, the most developed place in education. The rest can be imagined. According to the Education Bureau's survey results, two-thirds of Shanghai's elementary school teachers' living expenses are above 60 yuan, which is far from the Ministry's standard salary. As a result, those who change their minds are everywhere. The daily working hours often exceed twelve hours (including both in and out of the classroom), which impairs their health and affects their work efficiency. In particular, female teachers are burdened by household chores such as raising children and caring for the elderly, menstrual difficulties, physiological abnormalities during pregnancy, and lack of rest before and after childbirth, resulting in even higher rates of illness and death. Due to low salaries and heavy workloads, further education is simply out of the question.</p>
<p>In summary, the responsibility of teachers is so great. Therefore, my hopes for teachers are: (1) Cultivation of a noble personality, (2) Training of a strong physique, (3) In-depth study of profound knowledge. The life of teachers is so difficult. Therefore, my hopes for the authorities are: (1) Increase salaries and avoid arrears, (2) Reduce workload, (3) Stipulate working and rest hours, (4) Limit the number of students, (5) Provide pensions, (6) The Health Bureau should provide diagnosis and treatment for teachers without charging medical fees, (7) Free transportation, (8) Discounts on book purchases (9) Free admission and exemption from examinations for lectures at universities or research institutes and other academic institutions, (10) Dispatch them to domestic and foreign educational inspections, (11) Teacher nurseries, (12) Rest before and after childbirth, (13) Menstrual leave, (14) The establishment of more teacher positions (15) Independent funding for education.</p>
<p>In this way, teachers can have a professional spirit, have the opportunity to strive for further education, and devote their full energy to experiments. This is not only for the benefit of the teachers themselves, but also for the benefit of children and the nation. Written on Teachers' Day, year 23.</p>
<h3>The Mother of Children</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>She woke up, waking from a dream. The moonlight shone on her desolately, shining on the round and clear eyes of Ning Ge'er in the photo hanging on the wall. The children stared at her foolishly, as if they wanted to cry.</p>
<p>Xiang was sleeping next to her, having kicked off the quilt; muttering in his sleep. She sat up, gently taking the quilt and covering Xiang; then lay down again, sighing, "Ah, where is the beautiful dream?"</p>
<p>Remembering the past: When Xiang entered kindergarten, Ning Ge'er always cried and made a fuss wanting to go with her sister. At that time, Xiang was already four years old; Ning Ge'er was only two years old; Yuan Yuan was just born two months ago. Every day, she had to feed Yuan Yuan milk: make beautiful clothes for the children, make delicious dishes; bathe the children... Busy, with no time to think about her own comfort and health. Her body gradually weakened, often with headaches and backaches. But for the sake of the children, she was not sad. She had a hope, hoping for a beautiful and happy family.</p>
<p>The children were so lovely: That one time, Xiang's school held a "Mother's Meeting," and she brought Ning Ge'er to the meeting. Xiang performed "White Rabbit" and "Little Sparrow in the Tree." Wearing a rabbit's hat, carrying a rabbit's skin; wearing a sparrow's hat and shining with a sparrow's tail. She hadn't expected that four-year-old Xiang would listen to the rhythm of the piano, follow the order of the performance, and step to the beat of the music: performing lively and innocently on stage! Later, when giving out prizes, Xiang's teacher gave Xiang a small leather ball, and Xiang was a little embarrassed to accept it and hesitated; Ning Ge'er stood up from his visitor seat, walked over, and accepted it. Everyone laughed happily: How much more joyful was she?</p>
<p>Xiang could sing several songs; Ning Ge'er could also sing popular party songs and drizzle; Yuan Yuan could also smile. As for her, she was still making beautiful dreams all day long; dreaming of a perfect family, with children, with love. This dream seemed to be telling her in the children's songs and laughter: It will definitely come true.</p>
<p>Can dreams come true?</p>
<p>One evening at dusk, when the sun set behind the bamboo forest, she was sent to the riverbank by a man in the world. The mountains stood far away; the water flowed endlessly; her dream, like a bird that had flown away, had disappeared without a trace!</p>
<p>From then on, she returned to her parents' home, who could not understand her, holding her three children. Her father did not love a "modern youth," and therefore did not love a daughter who could not be a "virtuous wife and loving mother." Her stepmother only knew how to mock her with "new school" and "old school" terms, and had no sympathy for her at all! For the sake of the children and her own future life, she wanted to find "work"; but she didn't know where to start? She wanted to rely on old classmates to find a position as an elementary school teacher; but the classmates were afraid that she would not be able to educate because of the many children. Therefore, no one was willing to take the responsibility of introducing her. Later, her teacher invited her to go to the rural women's normal school to be the director of discipline. In order not to make the young children - the children who had never left her care - leave her, she had no choice but to live with her children in the school. But the ignorant students therefore attacked her and laughed at her; the colleagues also felt that having children in the school was a matter of impropriety; so the principal wanted her to rent a house outside. And the discipline personnel in the school must reside in the school for a long time; she was forced to leave the children she could not bear to leave for a moment!</p>
<p>She had no experience in doing things. She knew too little about "human affairs." She didn't know how to "show off" or "play tricks"; how to contact colleagues to promote herself and be supported by students. She only knew how to cultivate a kind and simple human nature with a frank and enthusiastic heart. She treated people and things with her sincere and simple nature. Therefore, she was attacked, harmed, and insulted by people everywhere. Society even suspected that she had been deceived by a man and had been an extremely disreputable, low-class concubine.</p>
<p>She took her children everywhere to make a living; whenever she lost her job, she took her children back to her parents' home. Her stepmother blamed her for being too bad-tempered and not being able to stay in places for long. She had no choice but to endure it. Unfortunately, her hometown encountered several bandits that year; coupled with the collapse of the countryside and the recession of commerce, the life of her parents' family also generally declined. Even her father sometimes thought about the future life of her and her children, and could not help but sigh in secret!</p>
<p>At this time, Xiang developed a severe case of typhoid fever. The fever was so high that she was already delirious. The bones of her whole body ached as if they were about to break apart, making her afraid to even hold her. What could she do? Living in the countryside, without money, and getting such a disease, she could only watch her die! Knowing that she had no ability to save her child, she let her family take care of the sick child in a daze. Fortunately, by chance, when the child's illness was already incurable, her aunt, who had only read some medical books and had no medical experience, saved her with medicine worth fifteen copper coins!</p>
<p>She had suffered too much and too greatly; she began to resent this cruel world. She hated why the world had given birth to her! She cursed why the world didn't destroy her! But the chains of life tightly bound her, leaving her no time to resent or curse. She couldn't think about the past again; she didn't dare to think about the future. For the sake of her children's future safety and happiness, she knew that she had to temporarily bear to leave her children: otherwise, she knew that the children would all perish together. So, on a morning of rainy and snowy weather, she escaped from her parents' home; abandoned her children; and with her only luggage - a grieving and courageous heart - ran far to Beiping, in the opposite direction of her hometown. She wanted to do everything in her power to save her children! But she was still making beautiful, rose-colored dreams - a beautiful family, with children, with flowers, with love...</p>
<p>She roamed in Beiping for a full three years. Did she still have the courage to think about these three years of wandering life? The beautiful rose-colored dreams, like birds, flew away and could never be found!</p>
<p>The cannon sound of September 18th awakened her from her delusion! She knew that under the claws of imperialism, everything was in a dark hell; how could her beautiful, rose-colored dreams come true? The oppressed as a whole cannot obtain a peaceful life. She would be no exception. Will the beautiful dreams still come true?</p>
<p>Creation</p>
<h3>Hesitation</h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>In the morning, Sister-in-law Sun hurried to take Second Aunt's arm and run onto the awning boat going to the city. A half-inch-long root stick shows through the center of the thick hair bun, the peach-colored face and the two women's hearts are as active as can be.</p>
<p>Although, in the activity is mixed with the anxiety of a wildfire burning.</p>
<p>Second Aunt is an experienced city goer, but this time she still couldn't put on a smiling face, looking so uncomfortable, staring warily at the calm river surface. In her heart, however, "Finding a job to do!" She said, over and over.</p>
<p>Sitting next to her like a wooden chicken, Sister-in-law Sun was even more uneasy. It was her first time going to the city. If she found a place to settle down, she would have to live in the city for a long time.</p>
<p>"Maybe this year will be a bumper year, maybe even better than last year's harvest. The fields are left unplanted..." Sister-in-law Sun looked at the green fields and trees along the shore, feeling the harmony of wind and rain, and couldn't help but think of the farming she was about to abandon and began to feel pity for it. People are used to a certain kind of life and often have a little attachment to it, especially when the other thing is already a vague uncertainty.</p>
<p>Second Aunt opened her experienced eyes:</p>
<p>"It's a waste that you can't let go, are you really going to starve to death before you give up? Last year wasn't a bumper year, we? Even if we sold our second-rate fields, it wasn't enough to pay the rent. In the end, we had to eat half and borrow half. I've figured it out."</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Sun frowned, thinking that Second Aunt was indeed more knowledgeable, and what she said made sense; but then she thought that Second Aunt's man was already working odd jobs in the city, coming back when the fields were busy, otherwise he would live in the city. This time, abandoning the fields to go to the city was not a big deal, but she was entrusting her fatherless children to her in-laws and going alone to climb a difficult path. Thinking about it, tears were about to fall from her eyes, so she quickly stopped them.</p>
<p>The people in the boat were all like her, each with a serious face, each calculating their own affairs in the city. If they knew each other, they would chat about firewood, rice, oil, and salt, mixed with seven points of sigh. Towards this hometown, they were as hesitant as towards a dilapidated temple, not knowing how to repair it, or simply destroy it.</p>
<p>Steamships passed the awning boats, one after another. Inside them sat the "upper-class figures" or "semi-upper-class figures" of the townships.</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Sun and Second Aunt wandered through the streets and alleys. Second Aunt searched all the brokerage shops that she knew a little bit, but couldn't find a place to stay. Every shop was full of two rows of people waiting to be hired, men and women. Some were in transit, and some were freshly arrived from the countryside. Everyone abandoned the villages and towns that could no longer produce oil and ran to find a livelihood in the city. As a result, unusually, at the beginning of the rice planting season, the brokerage shops were full of people waiting to be hired. Country folks fled to the city like bees rushing to an orchard, but the city was as dry as a skeleton.</p>
<p>"Keep your eyes open, put in the effort, we can do it, we're used to hardship..."</p>
<p>The owner of the brokerage shop wiped his sweat:</p>
<p>"People who just came from the countryside are even less popular, there are so many people that there's not even enough room to stay. Hurry back on the late boat!"</p>
<p>"Can't we just stay for one night? We only came out because we really couldn't plant the fields anymore." With impossible hopes, the two women carried their cloth bags and searched for the signs of brokerage shops on the street, their hearts both bitter and sour.</p>
<p>At the dock, travelers running to various places gathered, and boats of various styles were lined up in the heart of the river. Stepping on the gangplank, Sister-in-law Sun and Second Aunt trembled their legs and stepped past, squeezed in among so many people with the same fate.</p>
<h3>Children and Sunbathing</h3>
<p>— Geng Longgen</p>
<p>Of course, mothers want their children to be strong. In the minds of most Chinese mothers, they believe that the way to make their children strong is to drink more milk and eat more. Drinking milk and eating is indeed beneficial to children's health, but eating and drinking too much is harmful to their health.</p>
<p>Now I am going to introduce the best way to strengthen children's bodies: sunbathing.</p>
<p>Sunlight has been known since ancient times as something beneficial to people. However, Chinese mothers probably do not want their children to be exposed to the sun, which will cause their skin to turn black and lose the beauty of white skin.</p>
<p>Modern scientific research has shown that sunlight emits light and heat. These light and heat are extremely necessary for human life, and at the same time, they can treat and prevent tuberculosis and rickets in children. Therefore, it can make children's bodies strong and healthy.</p>
<p>Sunlight is so beneficial to people, and it does not need money to buy. It can be obtained anywhere. At the same time, sunbathing does not require any equipment. Therefore, using sunlight to strengthen children's bodies is more economical than other methods, and its effectiveness is greater than other methods. Sunlight reflects seven colors from raindrops: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Sunlight also reflects the same seven colors as the rainbow when it passes through a prism. The red color on one side is the heat ray in sunlight. The purple color on the other side is the light ray, but on both sides, there are still rays that we cannot see. The one on the red side is called infrared, which generates a lot of heat. The one on the purple side is called ultraviolet rays; this ray not only emits light, but also contains a large amount of special qualities that can strengthen the body and help growth.</p>
<p>When sunlight passes through solids, the light is filtered out. When sunlight passes through transparent objects such as glass, both heat rays and light rays can pass through, but ultraviolet rays cannot. Therefore, when sunbathing, the sunlight must be able to directly shine on the skin in order to obtain the benefits of ultraviolet rays.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet rays can give people strong bones and healthy muscles, and can also help growth and nutrition. When this ray is mixed with the heat rays in sunlight, it forms a dark brown pigment on the skin. Sunlight passes through this pigment, and ultraviolet rays can fully enter the body.</p>
<p>This ray also has the effect of killing bacteria, resisting infectious diseases, treating and preventing tuberculosis and rickets in children.</p>
<p>The best place for sunbathing is outdoors in hot weather, and indoors in cold weather. In cold weather, you should face the open window, and other doors and windows should be closed to prevent drafts. However, in extremely cold weather, difficulties may arise. It is said that there is now a special glass that allows ultraviolet rays to penetrate.</p>
<p>The duration of sunbathing should also be determined by the cold or hot weather. In cold weather, it should be done at noon, and in hot weather, it should be done in the morning and evening. Otherwise, it will be too cold or too hot, which may cause illness. The duration should also be regulated. It is best for children to make sunbathing a habit, just like brushing their teeth and washing their bodies. Also, it is best to have children play games and exercise at the same time when sunbathing.</p>
<p>Sunlight is more valuable than any tonic. I hope mothers with children will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Forward</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Looking around me,</p>
<p>The sky is so bleak,</p>
<p>The air is so calm,</p>
<p>All the scenery</p>
<p>Lacks vitality.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>I heard that over there,</p>
<p>Spring has come,</p>
<p>The path of roses,</p>
<p>Is covered with fragrant buds,</p>
<p>This is indeed a lovely environment.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>Just as I was about to set off,</p>
<p>I saw a path full of thorns in front of me;</p>
<p>Looking into the distance,</p>
<p>A wide chasm,</p>
<p>With green blood filling the middle,</p>
<p>A line of ramparts,</p>
<p>With white bones scattered around:</p>
<p>This is obviously the sacrifice of the pioneers, how can it not make me timid and frightened!</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>Just as I was hesitating like this,</p>
<p>And circling around like this,</p>
<p>Suddenly a surge of hot blood,</p>
<p>Rushed to my heart,</p>
<p>Making my fate,</p>
<p>Clear:</p>
<p>Retreat,</p>
<p>And sink into oblivion with the masses,</p>
<p>Stand still,</p>
<p>And be devoured by wolves,</p>
<p>Only by moving forward,</p>
<p>Is there a possibility of reaching the destination.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>Forward! Forward!</p>
<p>I am ready to fight with my hot blood,</p>
<p>Even if I follow in the footsteps of my predecessors,</p>
<p>It is still more glorious than not advancing or retreating,</p>
<p>Moreover, my soul,</p>
<p>Is already close to this blissful paradise.</p>
<h3>Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>I remember the first time I returned to my hometown, it was in mid-February of the lunar calendar, very close to the Qingming Festival. At that time, the weather in Guangdong was getting warmer day by day, and people were wearing thin clothes in light colors, fluttering and carefree, enjoying the pleasant spring sunshine early. My purpose in going back was first for some personal matters, and second because I grew up in other places and had never seen the clansmen at home. Also, my father wanted me to take the opportunity of the Qingming Festival to pay respects at the graves of our grandparents, whom we had never met, as a way of representing him in fulfilling his filial piety. Because of livelihood issues, he had been wandering outside for more than thirty years and never had time to go back and see them, although he was always thinking about them and dreaming about them.</p>
<p>My family is a declining scholarly family. Our ancestors left behind dozens of acres of fields, several farms, and a reputable and well-established money shop. However, the children relied solely on these assets for their livelihood and did nothing. Some were idle, and the so-called mahjong, pai gow, and fan-tan were their daily lives. Some smoked opium, lying in bed, holding their pipes, and puffing clouds of smoke all day long, not knowing what was called the September 18th Incident or the January 28th Incident. When there was no rice or firewood at home, they would say:</p>
<p>"Go to the money shop to withdraw it and charge it to my account."</p>
<p>Days passed. Finally, in this recession year, they went bankrupt. The money shop closed down, owing more than 100,000 silver dollars in debt. The field deeds were either pawned or sold, leaving very little.</p>
<p>Although they saw the ancestral property gradually being sold off and used up, they were still unwilling to be frugal for this Qingming Festival. It seemed that they would rather see the living descendants starve than not have several decent roast pigs to carry up the mountain to sacrifice to these dead ancestors. Not only roast pigs, but also wine, dishes, pastries, and fruits were required. After the grave sweeping ceremony was over, these things would be moved to the ancestral hall and distributed according to the number of descendants in each branch. The wine and dishes would be left until the evening to invite some relatives and friends to eat and drink in the ancestral hall. In fact, they did not sincerely want so many sacrificial offerings to be placed in front of the ancestors' graves; it was just that these people in charge wanted to take this opportunity to skim some money from the public funds, and those who sat idle were happy to not have to spend money, fattening their mouths, and even receiving a share of what was called "sacrificial meat money." They! The men were extremely happy. As for us women? Aren't we also descendants of this family's ancestors? We simply didn't have a share of anything; we were even mocked! And looked down upon!</p>
<p>I was always unhappy to see them treat us women like this, and I stood aside with a sullen face watching them distribute the things. My grand-uncle saw me standing still, and he casually took a share of the sacrificial meat money and gave it to me, and said with a slight smile:</p>
<p>"This is your father's share, you can take it for him."</p>
<p>Just then, our aunt happened to be standing next to me, and when she saw this, she sighed and said to me:</p>
<p>"Why aren't you a boy! Alas, you don't have any brothers, otherwise, you might get several shares today, who knows!" She sighed again, as if she was very worried about her deceased father: because our father – her younger brother – was the eldest son of our grandfather. Their traditional thinking was: only the eldest son can inherit the incense of this family, and no one else can. Therefore, the eldest sons must have an eldest grandson and an eldest daughter-in-law to pass down generation after generation. Coincidentally, our father had only daughters, none of whom suited their tastes. Therefore, they, the brothers and sisters, were very anxious for this branch of the family, and said that our father had to quickly take a concubine and have a son. At the time, I received the money and heard these words, and I felt very uncomfortable. I glanced at my aunt and ran straight home.</p>
<p>Finally, one morning, I said goodbye to them and left my hometown.</p>

<h3>The Future of Sexual Love</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>From whatever angle we look at it, under the current social system, human sexual love is just like a commodity in the stock exchange. On the one hand, only a small number of people are enjoying the happiness of sexual love, while on the other hand, a large number of people are struggling in pain in abnormal sexual love lives. Some people cannot afford to support a wife, so they have to take money to the human flesh market to sell unhealthy sexual love lives. Some people are forced by circumstances to sell their bodies to maintain their lives. At the same time, there are a large number of people who cannot get a satisfactory spouse, and even have to embrace "permanent" singleness!</p>
<p>Therefore, from the past to the present, from the perspective of the historical evolution process, the record of sexual love between men and women is now writing an extremely tragic page. On this page, I don't know how many youths, how much wisdom, and how many lives have been buried!</p>
<p>However, the wheels of history will never remain at a certain stage forever, and the progress of history will inevitably destroy this unhealthy sexual love life of mankind. In the future, when the world's science and production technology have reached the highest stage, and all the wealth of society is completely controlled by human beings themselves, then, the sexual love life between the two sexes will of course break away from the shackles of "commodification" and embark on the right track. In addition to doing very short necessary labor work every day, people can use a lot of time to study science, art, and various specialized knowledge to improve the level of human knowledge. At the same time, there are ample opportunities for various physical exercises and games, as well as attention to all hygiene that is beneficial to the body. In addition, there is a lot of spare time that can be used in various entertainment aspects (such as music, dance, movies, drama, literature...). Under these conditions, the relationship between men and women, the life of sexual love, is not only free from all laws, religions, morality, and rituals, and the restrictions of money, but is purely based on the love of both men and women. Secondly, things like the convergence of thoughts and interests, the common feelings of hobbies and art, and the harmony of physique, appearance, and temperament are also incidental conditions for achieving a perfect love. As for the health of both sexes and all knowledge of sex, at that time, there must be specialized hospitals and health institutions responsible for checking the bodies of men and women, so that those who suffer from syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases are prohibited from marrying, so as not to harm others and the race. And, the absolute freedom of marriage and divorce, as well as the widespread knowledge of proper sex life, will make human sexual love life healthier and more fulfilling!</p>
<p>This is of course not only an ideal, but also an inevitable fact. However, we know that the realization of this fact is by no means just a "fateful" inevitability. The main thing is that we need our arduous and great efforts - because this is by no means a simple problem, this is one department of the entire social problem. To solve this problem, we mainly need the improvement of the entire society.</p>

<h3>Finance – Market Sentiment for Gold is Declining – Silver Amendment to be Discussed – Result: Another Drop of 1.3 Yuan</h3>
<p>Market sentiment for gold is weak, showing signs of weakness day after day. The market initially rose because the US silver price rebounded and banks were buying, but the Central Bank's offerings were sluggish, and market sentiment declined again, dragging down the Shanghai market. Overseas news was slightly unfavorable, and market sentiment was even weaker. Selling pressure suddenly intensified at noon. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw the British pound rise and the US dollar fall, and the forward silver price on the metal exchange also fell back. The exchange rate declined, and London spot gold rose by three pence. US cotton fell by five pounds, and US wheat rose by half a cent. Stocks soared by 3.72 yuan, but market sentiment was still good. Bids were opened outside the market and immediately rose back. After opening, banks showed strong buying interest, trying to pull up forward US dollar exchange rates. Therefore, the upper market situation was stable. It was learned that the HSBC bank's listed British and American exchange rates were both flat, and market sentiment saw highs, leaning towards selling. However, the Central Bank's offerings were insufficient, and market sentiment became uncertain, gradually turning weak. The domestic market also loosened, and a decline was reported. However, because banks were still willing to buy at low prices, except for carry trades, the price fell but still rebounded, hovering around five yuan for a long time. Later, it was heard from the Associated Press that the silver amendment would be submitted to the Senate for discussion next Monday. Although it lacked much impact, market sentiment, due to the Saturday factor, showed an excess of supply over demand in the market. The news of the overnight silver price in Seattle falling to 25.375.25 only caused a rebound of one yuan. Afterwards, it remained under selling pressure and was difficult to rally. The market situation for half a day was firm and then weak again. Transactions in the market were mostly in and then out. Now, the market situation for half a day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 1,016.1 yuan, 1.9 yuan higher than the previous close. Physicals opened at six yuan. The morning opening price of the exchange market's near-term selling price was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 5625 for the British pound and 32.875 for the US dollar. Dalian trade bonds rose from 5.7 yuan to 7 yuan. Yuanchun, Yifengyong, and Fuxingyong sold, retreating to within 6.5 yuan. Sumitomo and others continued to buy September US dollars at 33.25 yuan. Shengda, Yuqingyong, and Qianchangxiang bought trade bonds, and the price rose to 7.5 yuan. It was learned that HSBC's listed British and American exchange rates were both flat, and market sentiment saw highs and sold off. Tianfeng, Fuan, Yuanchangyong, Zhaofengchang, Daxingyong, and Dingkang all sold, falling to within five yuan. Although Hengyu bought, the exchange market hardened, and July US dollars could be settled at 0625. Yiyu, Tongtaichang, and others sold to four yuan. Yuqingyong and Meifengyong bought trade bonds at low prices. Zhejiang and Zhengjin bought September US dollars at 3125, rising to five yuan. Sellers continued to pour in, and the market situation was extremely weak. Later, Renfayong, Yuanmaoyong, and Fuxingyong bought trade bonds, once rising from 4.1 yuan to 5.4 yuan. Fuyu supplied, still downstream. Shengda, Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, Yuanchangyong, Yongde, and Qingyu sold to 3.3 yuan. The overnight silver price fell by 25. Fuyu and Chunyuanyong bought at low prices, pulling up one yuan. Yuanmao and Hengxingyuan sold off, and the price continued to fall. Yuqingyong sold off aggressively, and the price fell to 2.5 yuan. Bingxinglai bought, rising to three yuan. After hovering, the closing price at noon was 1,012.9 yuan, and physicals were auctioned at 2.2 yuan. After the close, Yicheng, Hengyu, and physicals sold trade bonds, and the price finally retreated to within two yuan. It was found that the highest price for half a day was 1,017.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,012.5 yuan, a fluctuation of five yuan. As a result, the price continued to fall by 1.3 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on HSBC's US dollar exchange rate, which remained unchanged, still at 32.75 yuan, and the standard gold price was 1,056 yuan and some change. According to the closing price, the markup was about 43 yuan, more than one yuan more than the previous close. The ledger price for July was 1,013 yuan, and the morning water payment was 1,013 yuan. The spot market was calm, still lacking transactions. The additional water was weaker, and Tianjin goods were generally at 11.5 yuan, but there were no transactions. Although there were sources, they were to offset previous short positions, and new transactions had not yet been initiated. The Central Bank's offerings were relatively sluggish, and no transactions were heard.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were confusing. In total, Wanxing, Yifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, Huixiang, Bingxing, Ruikang, Shengda, Fuchang, and others were on the buying side. Fuyu, Yuanchun, Tianfeng, Yuanmao, Fuan, Qingyu, Dadecheng, Dingkang, Futaiheng, Daxingyong, Yuanchangyong, Zhaofengchang, Hongxing, Shunli, and others were on the selling side. Yuqingyong and Hengtai and Hengxingyuan went in and out. Yifengyong, Tongchun, and Fuxingyong went out and in. Dalian trade bonds totaled more than 600, with about 500 rolled in. Shunli totaled less than 800, with more than 100 rolled out. Guangdong trade bonds Hengxing made scattered ins and outs. Shengda rolled in more than 100. The total number of transactions on that day was 24,094.</p>
<p>As of today, the long positions for July totaled more than 5,200 for Wanxing, more than 3,800 for Shunli, more than 3,500 for Tongfengheng, more than 3,400 for Yifengyong, more than 3,100 for Fuchang, nearly 2,200 for Hengyu, more than 1,400 each for Fuan and Yuanyi, slightly over 1,000 for Dadecheng, more than 800 for Yuanshengyong, more than 700 each for Runchangyu and Shenyu, more than 600 for Runchangyong, more than 500 each for Yuanchangyong, Zhaofengchang, and Hengxingyuan, and more than 400 each for Dashun and Dafengheng. The short positions totaled more than 4,600 for Qianchangxiang, slightly over 2,500 for Zhengchang, slightly under 1,900 for Hengxing, more than 1,700 for Senchangyong, more than 1,600 for Yicheng, more than 1,500 for Huixiang, more than 1,100 each for Fuyu, Huiyuan, and Fuxingyong, slightly over 1,000 each for Yuqingyong and Tianfeng, more than 800 for Ruixing, more than 600 each for Dacheng, Chunyuanyong, Tongchun, and Yuankangxiang, and more than 500 each for Tianfayong, Tongtaichang, Xianda, Qingfayong, and Shenkang, more than 400 each for Hongxing, Changshengyong, Yuandayong, and Shunmao. The total number of chips was 32,802, with a total of 33 long parties and 66 short parties.</p>

<h3>Weekend Silver and Money Business Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the weekend, and banks were only open for half a day, so various market conditions showed a light state again. In the foreign interbank market, both the morning and afternoon markets were 8%, and the head transaction was still filled with head positions. The demand was greater than the supply, and there was no addition of water from beginning to end. In the transaction of split notes, there were more than 3.6 million in the morning market transaction and new transactions, and more than 100,000 in the afternoon market transaction. There were more than 400,000 transactions in the Small General Association. The transaction of foreign mortgages was 500,000, and more than 900,000 new items were made. In terms of collection and delivery, due to the half-day closure, only the morning half-day was open, so it was very different from usual. It is estimated that foreign banks collected and delivered more than 1.2 million in bank notes, and various goods, exchange guarantees, and miscellaneous collections and deliveries were more than 1.8 million. The withdrawal was 200,000. Chinese banks collected and delivered more than 2.0 million in bank notes, and various goods, exchange guarantees, and miscellaneous collections and deliveries were more than 3.3 million, customs tax was more than 400,000, and the withdrawal was 300,000.

Money shops collected and delivered more than 34 million in foreign public lists, more than 310,000 in foreign head withdrawals, and more than 700,000 in banknotes were recovered and issued more than 900,000. Various road exchange money was more than 300,000, and the actual settlement was more than 300,000, the way the guests went without food, and the path to a source of ten million. Also, the total number of exchanges on the 9th at the bill exchange was 6,649,369 yuan and 10 jiao, including 2,744,308 yuan and 6 jiao 6 fen in silver dollars, and 3,905,060 yuan, 4 jiao 4 fen in exchange transfers in silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Jiangjiao Still Plunging</h3>
<p>In the past week, Jiangnan's small ocean has been plummeting, with a difference of almost 20 yuan. The reason is that the two cocoon loans have been recalled, and the transactions have not been smooth, so the price has fallen endlessly. The morning market yesterday was 820 yuan, and the afternoon market was 818 yuan, which was another 8 yuan lower than the previous day. The volume of transactions was 10,000 jiao in the morning market and 6,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong's small ocean has a relatively bad transaction, so although there are ups and downs, it is extremely subtle and does not differ too much. The morning market yesterday was 737.8 yuan, and the afternoon market was 738.5 yuan, which was 7 jiao higher than the previous day. The volume of transactions was 45,000 jiao in the morning market and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 329,000 wen, which was 500 wen shorter than the previous day. The transaction cost was 11,000 yuan in foreign currency, totaling 36,190 strings of wen.</p>
<h3>Securities - The Volatile Bond Market - Market Sentiment Remains Firm - Short-Term Money Reaches New High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was somewhat chaotic due to it being Saturday. Prices retreated slightly then rose, then rose slightly and retreated again. Although there was a sense of instability, there were no significant environmental changes, and the market had not yet reached maturity. Short covering and arbitrage trading remained very active. Short-term money reached a new high of $71.80. The general sentiment was that it would inevitably fall back, but after hovering for two or three days, there was still a slight increase, suggesting that breaking through the $72 mark was just around the corner. Market sentiment remained firm as before, and any setbacks were just temporary fluctuations. Both the Unified and Salt Taxes have reached 60-70% of their par value. Yesterday, at the opening of the morning session, there was a general small retreat of one or two jiao to three or four jiao, with the "16th" selling off particularly vigorously. However, the "96 Gold Long" actually improved by two jiao, indicating that the previous decline was of a temporary speculative nature. In the second session, the "16th" suddenly saw buying interest again, and the "4th" also saw considerable demand, causing market prices to uniformly rise by one or two jiao to four and a half jiao. Prices fluctuated, but market sentiment remained strong. At the opening of the afternoon session, the aforementioned continued to rise by one or two jiao. Since the Salt Tax started, there was another slight decrease of one or two jiao. At the close, many profits were taken, resulting in a small retreat of one or two jiao. As a result, price movements were inconsistent, with the distant contracts for demobilization "19 Good," "20 Rolls," "20 Customs," and "22 Customs" declining slightly by five fen. The rest continued to rise by five fen to one jiao to three jiao. The total transaction volume was $11,132,000. The following is a comparison table showing the results of the price fluctuations, highs, and lows: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: Hundred Yuan)</p>

<h3>Steel Industry Labor Unrest Shows Signs of Resolution - New York Stock Market Soars</h3>
<p>The New Fung Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (8th), the stock market saw vigorous buying on Wall Street due to expectations that President Roosevelt would resolve the steel industry strike, leading to a sharp rise in prices and active trading, the highest since mid-May. Small exchanges and bonds also rose. Grains initially rose due to bullish Canadian wheat and expansion rumors, but then fell due to profit-taking by bulls. The New York agent of this firm reported that (securities) rose due to signs of resolution in the steel industry labor unrest and the possibility of an early adjournment of Congress, with a continuing upward trend. (Wheat) Buying from the eastern United States, poor domestic and foreign weather, and pest infestations led to absorption during sell-offs, making it advisable to buy on dips. According to government reports, the condition of winter wheat on June 1st was 55.3% of normal, with an estimated production of 400,357,000 bushels, compared to an average annual production of 632,011,000 bushels. The condition of spring wheat was 41.3%. (Cotton) Increased buying, but also increased selling from the South, made it difficult for market prices to rise. It is rumored that Washington is considering increasing cotton acreage by 10 million mu next year to curb increased foreign production. Recent sales of cloth have been very good, with good forecasts for the East and excessive dryness in the West. Traders are paying increasing attention to weather and the fundamental elements of cotton. Factories took in a total of 160,000 bales this week. (Rubber) The market rose following Singapore and London. According to insiders, US consumption in May is estimated at 44,000 tons, with strong demand from consumers in major markets. (Silver) Fluctuations were minimal, but the market remained firm. The government is again buying. There has been slight progress on the issue of eliminating the profit tax in the silver case. The total daily volume was 1,610,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>June 7th June 8th Change</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 94.72 98.44 Up 3.72</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 43.29 45.09 Up 1.80</p>

<p>11 Commodities 57.06 57.37 Up 0.31</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Yarn and Cotton Return to a Peaceful and Normal State</h3>
<p>General Sentiment is Bullish with Stronger Buying Interest</p>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firmer, but trading volume has greatly decreased, so the market is peaceful. However, the majority of sentiment is bullish, as the price of Japanese yarn is high, and the absorption volume is particularly large. Unfortunately, current yarn sales are sluggish, mainly due to the Dragon Boat Festival, which has caused merchants to pause. There is hope for development after the festival, so there are still many bulls, and the amount of long and short positions continues to increase, making it difficult to stabilize the market.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Recovers to Yuan Xu</h3>
<p>At the opening of the futures yarn market, the market lacked buyers due to a slight decline in American cotton prices. Prices fell slightly in the second and third sessions, then recovered at the close, resulting in gains of one, two, and five jiao for each month. In the afternoon, news of favorable American cotton conditions stirred the yarn market, and buying momentum resumed, with gains of five, six, and eight jiao to one yuan and one jiao for each month. The total trading volume for the day was 23,050 bales. Sales were: Jun Chang 1,000 bales, Ren Feng 450 bales, De Ji 400 bales, Tai Xing 450 bales, Yuan Da 650 bales, Chun Ji 2,400 bales, Tong Fu 500 bales, and Ji Feng 500 bales. Purchases were: Heng Yi 350 bales, Ji Feng 300 bales, Da Feng 2,750 bales, Yuan Da 400 bales, Sen Kang 700 bales, Ren Feng 300 bales, Yi Chang 650 bales, and Chang Feng 1,100 bales.

<h3>Yarn Sales Slightly Increased Compared to Before</h3>
<p>Current yarn sales are more than before. The total volume purchased by various merchant groups today is 670 bales, with prices up by one jiao and a half. The purchase amount for each merchant group is listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 170 Changsha 110 Xiamen 10</p>
<p>Guangdong 60 Ningbo 20 Sichuan 300</p>
<p>The cotton market initially fell then rose. Old cotton prices were flat, while new cotton prices rose more sharply. In the afternoon, Reuters reported that excessive rainfall was affecting American cotton, and buying interest suddenly intensified, causing the market to rise. It is reported that bullish companies have very strong intentions and are still holding tight. However, factories are facing labor difficulties, and the number of workers reducing their hours is increasing daily, which is reducing the demand for raw cotton.</p>
<h3>New Cotton Prices are Stronger</h3>
<p>At the opening of the futures cotton market, prices fell slightly following the overseas cotton market. The market situation was calm and lifeless, with little trading. Near-month contracts fell by five fen to one jiao and a half, while far-month contracts rose by five fen to one jiao. In the afternoon, Reuters reported that heavy showers in the Northwest of the United States were damaging cotton fields, causing American cotton prices to rise, and buying interest resumed. Bullish companies returned to buy, old cotton rose by one jiao and a half to two jiao, and new cotton rose by four jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 81,900 dan. Sales were: Rui Yuan 2,500 dan, Chang Feng 3,800 dan, Jun Chang 8,500 dan, You Da 6,300 dan, Hui Kang 3,900 dan, Xie Sheng 2,100 dan, Chang Yu 1,500 dan, Ji Feng 1,800 dan, Geng Feng 3,100 dan, Yi Chang 2,200 dan, and Ming Hua 1,300 dan.

<p>Total 830,500</p>
<h3>Factory Demand is Just So-So</h3>
<p>Current cotton consumption is not strong. Sources include Yao cotton 450 bales and Tong cotton 350 bales. Current cotton selling prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet Cotton 45.50 Yu Feng Factory bought 500 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory. Shashi Cotton 45.50 Another 470 pieces and also</p>
<p>Xia Sha Cotton 44.00 Another 164 pieces and also</p>
<h3>Concerning News about the New American Cotton Crop</h3>
<p>New York, June 8th telegraphs a report on the week's cotton market: Continued rain in the eastern cotton belt and drought in the wheat belt, which may extend to the Southwest, has led to concerns about the future of the cotton crop, triggering speculative demand in the raw cotton market. There are fewer sellers, and market prices are rising. When the July contract price rose to 1.2 cents, short selling increased. There is also news that one-cent loans of cotton are now being gradually transported from the interior. However, talk of inflation has resurfaced, and reports of unfavorable weather continue to circulate, so short selling and profit-taking at slight declines are absorbed by buyers. The East has repeatedly complained of grassy cotton fields and waterlogged cotton stalks. The situation has not yet escalated, but Texas and Oklahoma now need rain. However, if the East continues to experience prolonged rain, it will lead to a major pest infestation, and waterlogged cotton stalks will quickly deteriorate in dry and hot weather. The current labor unrest in the steel industry is concerning and is limiting buying interest in the cotton market.</p>
<h3>Small Speculators Sell American Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially stable due to limited inventory and short covering. Later, there was a slight increase in selling by retail investors, resulting in a decline of 5 points per pound for spot goods and 5-6 points per pound for futures. British cotton futures rose 4-6 points. Indian cotton saw profit-taking by bulls, selling by speculators, and weakness due to sluggish current demand. As a result, Pingal fell 7.5 jiao, and Oomra and White Rosie fell 2.5 jiao. The original telegraphs are listed below: (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day (National Currency) British Cotton Compared to Previous Day (National Currency)</p>

<h3>Grains - Current Flour Prices Rise, Futures Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw stable conditions in all months after the morning opening. The quoted price for foreign wheat was approximately 1-2 jiao higher in Chicago and 2-3 jiao higher in Canada. Therefore, after the opening, the market saw good profits for all months. In addition, factories were observing and not selling, and outside bulls were still absorbing, with prices up by approximately 1 fen compared to the previous day. Then, the bulls took profits, and prices retreated slightly. By the afternoon opening, the market was initially quiet. Later, news that Fu Xin Factory was quoting 2 fen higher for spot goods caused the market to increase. Distant months also saw increasingly tighter conditions. All factories uniformly held back from selling, resulting in favorable conditions for all months. As for the Tianjin area, they were still selling. As a result, the current month rose 2.5 fen, July rose 1.5 fen, August rose 2 fen, September rose 2.25 fen, October rose 2.5 fen, and November rose 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Near Good, Far Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw near-month prices rise and far-month prices flat after the morning opening. The current month saw a recovery of 4-5 fen after short covering due to limited positions and unprepared inland hedging. Afterwards, there was no further activity. Far-month contracts saw flat conditions due to sparse buying and active hedging. By the afternoon opening, trading was not active, and buyers remained hesitant, causing the market to weaken slightly. As a result, August fell 1 fen, September fell 3 fen, and October fell 2 fen. The rest saw no changes. Current wheat remained active. Old goods saw stable prices, while new goods were flat. 240 bags of new wheat from Caishi Ji were opened at 2.8 yuan. 3.17 yuan and 3.05 yuan for Guide old wheat and Yingzhou wheat respectively, 2,700 bags of Huangqiao wheat at 3.07, sold to Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Late Rice No Significant Fluctuations</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from various merchant groups was over twenty companies (over three thousand five hundred stones), and the outflow was also slightly slower, so although the source was scarce, the situation did not appear tight. Northern merchant groups purchased a total of 1,500-1,600 bags of late rice from Qingjiao, Songjiang, and Liantang, as well as three to four hundred bags of thick粳 rice. There were no increases or decreases in the price of late rice. Due to the limited appetite of shops for thick 粳 rice, it was difficult for prices to stand, because the seller was strongly insisting. Only old and inferior rice was slightly weaker by several points, while fresh rice was still able to stand firm. The supply and demand for Du Yang pointed rice was similar, and the overcast yuan was slightly stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of twelve or thirteen companies arrived from Hexia. The sales of various types of rice were normal for high-quality white粳 rice, slightly active for mid-grade and inferior rice, slightly changed for high-quality white元, and relatively sluggish for mid-grade and inferior rice. There was some trading of sheep杜 pointed rice. There were few customers from the port asking about 秈 rice. The price of high-quality white粳 rice was stable, and slightly tight for mid-grade and inferior rice. The price of high-quality white元 rice was stable, and slightly close to the scale for mid-grade and inferior rice. The price of Du sheep pointed rice was stable, and the pointed rice from the port showed a slightly rising trend.</p>
<h3>Hakka 秈 Rice Continues to Be Sold in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hakka 秈 rice market saw continued arrivals and sufficient inventory. The market situation was relatively stable. Merchants from this street and Zhejiang province still had no good appetite. Merchants from this street were recently paying attention to the goods arriving from Hexia, while merchants from Zhejiang province still had foreign rice shipments that had not been completely loaded. Therefore, their appetite was very light. Yesterday, merchants from this street only handled three to four hundred bags of Yingchou Ji rice and Bengbu Ji rice. However, merchants from Fujian province purchased a larger quantity, with inquiries about various Ji and Cao rice. 6,500 bags of rice from Jiangxi, Hunan, Hankou, Shashi, and Jiangbei were sold, propping up the sluggish market and turning it into a lively situation. Prices did not rise due to sufficient arrivals and inventory and weak outflows, but the underlying support was visible. If there is further active trading in the next few days, there will be hope for a gradual increase.</p>
<h3>New Broad Beans from Xiashi Open at 2.6 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 130 bags of new white broad beans from Xiashi arrived, opening at a price of 2.6 yuan. The goods were of mid-range quality and were purchased by Tianjin merchants. 119 bags of white broad beans from Yongjiang were opened at a price of 4 yuan, also purchased by Tianjin merchants. Over 900 bags of green broad beans from Minhang arrived, with prices according to the original market, but the quality was higher than the previous batches. Sales were to merchants from Shantou, Guangdong, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Tianjin, and this street, except for merchants from Shantou, who were inactive. It is reported that the first batch of white broad beans from Jiading will arrive around tomorrow. The rapeseed production area reported flat prices, and Shanghai buyers were not eager to purchase, so trading was sparse. Yesterday, only a few dozen bags of Nanjing goods were opened, including 49 bags of whole spicy seeds at 2.5 yuan and 39 bags of small-grain common goods at 3.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, This Factory's Cotton White Sugar Fell by 5 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw very light trading as today is the weekend and there were no shipments. The association's划盘 price for spot 24 raw sugar white was 20.65 yuan, the price for this store's goods was 20.75 yuan, and the price for re-exported goods was 6.75 yuan. There were no changes for Dutch red sugar and Taikoo sugar. The price of top-brand number one cotton white sugar from this factory was 19.05 yuan, down 5 fen from the previous day. The smallest brand was only 18.7 yuan. As the number of Chaoqing numbers in stock is decreasing daily, and land prices are high, it is extremely difficult to划盘. Therefore, there were no openings in yesterday's market. Lianbang Da Laihua only opened 30 large bags of rock candy, priced at 23.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, Orchid Seeds Rose by Approximately 2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Although the orchid seeds that arrived the day before yesterday were of ordinary quality, they sold well because the inventory was now exhausted. They opened yesterday, rising by approximately 2 yuan from the previous market. There were no changes in old and poor-quality goods, and sales were also sporadic.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Thin Tinplate with Rolling Defects is Becoming Popular</h3>
<p>The overseas prices of thin tinplate are soaring, and very few local companies are purchasing it. There is concern about a shortage of arrivals, and current inventory is also low, so market sentiment is very firm. The standard grade is becoming rare due to the small amount of goods, and the market price per box has increased from 50 yuan to 54-55 yuan. It is reported that tobacco companies and biscuit factories made slight purchases yesterday, opening over 240 boxes.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Qifu Black Tea Falls Again and Again</h3>
<p>The arrival of Qimen and Fuliang black tea is quite abundant every day. The outflow to the British firm is also increasing due to the imminent departure of the British Company's ship and the increased demand. However, tea merchant sentiments are scattered like sand, and the ability to persevere is very weak. Foreign firms, understanding this situation, are gradually tightening their valuations. Therefore, although black tea trading has been active in recent days, market prices have fallen again and again. The current selling price of first-batch top and middle-grade Zhuang tea from Qimen has fallen to 145 yuan. The price of inferior quality goods from De has shrunk to 65 yuan. On average, the price of goods has fallen by a significant 30-40 yuan compared to when the market opened. There were no significant changes in the market for green tea. The selling price of Tunxi Zhenmei is 105 yuan, and the selling price of Zhenmei from Suian and Shexian is from 90 yuan to 98 yuan. However, the outflow of local Zhuang Zhenmei is slightly sluggish.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cocoon Markets Will Soon End</h3>
<p>The number of cocoons collected by Pinghu Cocoon Firm is sufficient. This year's improved silkworm breeds in Pinghu Xin Dai and other places are quite good. The cocoon production is abundant, and the cocoons are of excellent quality. There are more than ten cocoon firms in the whole county. The price of cocoons is not high. The average price of improved silkworm cocoons is approximately 30 yuan, and the price of local cocoons is 18-19 yuan. Each firm has collected a sufficient number of cocoons and is preparing to stop the scale. Silkworm farmers are all losing money, and many are reeling silk themselves.</p>
<p>Many Silkworm Farmers in Jiashan Bake Cocoons Themselves. This year, farmers in Jiashan's various cities and villages lost money on early native silkworm, but improved breeds in the later batch are doing quite well, and cocoon production is still abundant. Cocoon markets in the four townships have been open for over a week, with the highest price for improved breeds at 30 yuan and the price for native breeds at 18 yuan. Farmers cannot cover their leaf costs, so many are drying their own cocoons. Fewer goods are arriving on the market, and the cocoon market will soon end.</p>
<p>Jiangyin Superior Cocoons are Expected to Rise in Price. New cocoons from Jiangyin's four townships are gradually entering the market. There are over thirty cocoon firms open. This year, the price of mulberry leaves is high, and farmers' silkworm costs are higher. However, the price offered by cocoon firms is only 30 yuan for improved breeds and 20 yuan for native breeds. Silkworm farmers are losing money and reluctant to sell. Later, the price rose to 35 yuan, and the price for native breeds was 22 yuan. However, the price of cocoons in neighboring counties (Wujin and Wuxi) is higher, so superior cocoons are expected to rise to 40 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Collapse of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>— A Contribution from Yun Congjun</p>
<p>The result of the First World War, besides the sacrifice of millions of lives and the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars, the only achievement was the establishment of an organization to promote world peace – the League of Nations.</p>
<p>When the Treaty of Versailles came into effect on January 10, 1920, and the League of Nations was formally established, politicians and the people suffering from the war around the world celebrated the establishment of this world peace organization with cheers. Everyone believed that the world would be peaceful from then on, and that international peace had been deeply guaranteed.</p>
<p>However, only a little over a decade has passed, and all objective events have proven the error of people's ideals at that time. Although Geneva is still playing peaceful music, what we hear now is the sinister laughter of the god of war. The failure of the disarmament conference, the frantic arms race among the great powers, the Anglo-American hegemony in the world market, the Japanese-American conflict in the Pacific, the intensification of German-French contradictions, and the Russo-Japanese preparations for war in the Far East – all of this is enough to prove that the whole world is now just like the eve of the First World War, with the air everywhere filled with war. Now, except for three-year-old children, probably no one would doubt the inevitable outbreak of a second world war!</p>
<p>In the face of this crisis of a great war, the League of Nations has lost its effectiveness, and the touchstone of all justice, reason, and peace has proven that the League of Nations is just a decaying corpse. In the past, although the League of Nations was an [obscured text] organization of the great powers, it could sometimes be used to ease conflicts between them, or to whitewash world peace. However, now, in the face of the accelerated development of the inherent conflicts of world imperialism, this agency for whitewashing peace cannot but tend towards collapse.</p>
<p>First, Japan tore up international conventions, occupied the three eastern provinces of our country, and formally withdrew from the League of Nations. Then, Germany expressed dissatisfaction with the disarmament issue and formally announced its withdrawal on October 14 last year. Now, although the League of Nations barely exists, the main countries such as the United States, Russia, Japan, and Germany have not participated, and the role of the League of Nations itself has been greatly weakened. In particular, the recent disarmament conference – the only work of the League of Nations – has declared bankruptcy, and the work of the League of Nations has suffered the final test.</p>
<p>Not only that, but even within the current fragmented League of Nations, the imperialist powers are still fighting each other, using it as a center.</p>
<p>In order to seize France's hegemony in Europe, Italy has established the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian alliance, and at the same time is loudly advocating the reorganization of the League of Nations, attempting to use this to seize control of the League of Nations in its own hands, in order to weaken France's power in Europe.</p>
<p>In the past, the United States has always indicated that it would not interfere in the affairs of the League of Nations, but in recent years, the development of American financial power in Europe cannot but cause it to actively intervene in all European political issues. The United States is not only competing with Britain in Europe, but also competing with France. The United States always remembers to undermine the anti-American united front in Europe. Therefore, the United States is not only unwilling to maintain the League of Nations, but also wants to promote its collapse in all aspects.</p>
<p>Those who want to maintain the League of Nations are only France and Britain. Recently, in order to maintain the existence of the League of Nations, Britain and France have tried their best to win over the Soviet Union to join. As for the Soviet Union, it may join the League of Nations in the future in order to consolidate the current Franco-Russian alliance and to deal with fascist Germany, or it may not join the League of Nations after all because the Soviet Union does not want to participate in the vortex of European politics. However, under the current circumstances, the League of Nations is already in a state of fragmentation and disintegration. Even if the Soviet Union joins in the future, it will still be unable to save the crisis of the League of Nations itself!</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, we can see that the fate of the League of Nations has reached the final stage of bankruptcy. The world is a powerful powder keg, and the bankruptcy of the League of Nations shows that the period of peace between the First and Second World Wars has ended, and the gunfire of the Second World War will become the final funeral of the League of Nations!</p>
<p>Four hundred million compatriots on this world battlefield, how shall we cope with all the future events? The League of Nations has collapsed. Do we still have to rely on the League of Nations?</p>

<h3>Locusts</h3>
<p>— Si Yu</p>
<p>The rural villages in summer are silent under the thick, sultry air. Women, having finished a busy season in the silkworm fields, drag their tired bodies around the houses tidying away all the tools used during silkworm rearing, and also the dried-up silkworm cocoons left over from selling to the cocoon merchants. The men, carrying ploughs and hoes, driving water buffaloes, holding in their hearts the disappointment that this year’s cocoons are also not worth much money, are on their way to the fields, depositing their stomachs full of displeasure on the hoe edges and plough tips, heavily tilling the soil, hoping, hoping that a bountiful autumn harvest will alleviate the pressures of life. The rural villages in summer are silent under the thick, sultry air, and there is little sound of footsteps walking around the villages, even the yellow dogs are dozing under the willow shade or beside the bamboo fence.</p>
<p>Only Sixth Grandpa, the village elder who is respected in Shangxing Village where everyone is busy in the fourth month, is fortunate enough to go to town to sit in a teahouse, drink a bowl of tea, listen to some news from the newspapers that is in reality already old, and then return in the evening crow-call, taking advantage of the fact that the farmers mostly wash their feet, holding bowls and gathering in the open space to eat dinner, and telling everyone stories like Shan Hai Jing (Classic of Mountains and Seas). When the simple listeners find it funny, they will spit grains of rice all over the ground, and then regretfully and fondly bend down to pick them up, blow off the dust and put them back into their mouths, and when they hear something infuriating, they will stomp their ankles and curse the county magistrate “at sea.” Only when they hear that donations are going to be increased again or money and grain are being urged to be paid, each person scatters home with an expression of not knowing whether to laugh or cry, finds faults with his wife or children to scold and beat, using this to vent his anger.</p>
<p>Today, the appearance is a bit different. Shangxing Village, which is usually quiet because everyone is busy working, became agitated after Village Head Sixth Grandpa hurriedly returned early from town. Gui Sheng and his son, who were hoeing in the fields in the west of the village, were the first to see Sixth Grandpa bowing to each field of wheat that was nodding in the wind, muttering something in his mouth. Gui Sheng and his son were a little afraid to interrupt him, so they just stopped hoeing and watched. Sixth Grandpa ordered the two of them to quickly call all the men to carry their hoes home, and then ran rickety to the village.</p>
<p>When the men inexplicably returned to the village, they saw Sixth Grandpa burning incense and lighting candles in front of the Meng Jiang Temple in the east of the village, and they understood half of it, and consciously rushed over with hurried steps, asking Sixth Grandpa if the locusts were coming.</p>
<p>"Locusts, heavens, heavenly insects are coming! They flew over from × County, opened their mouths in the west of the town, and ate all the wheat ears and rice sprouts. Heaven's will, quickly pray to the Bodhisattvas!" Most of the men followed Sixth Grandpa and knelt down, only a few young people hesitated.</p>
<p>The women also ran out from the main rooms, standing not far from the Meng Jiang Temple, looking at this small temple, looking at their husbands or sons kneeling in front of the temple, and then turned their heads worriedly to look at the western sky. The children hid in fear beside their grandmothers or mothers, waiting for the arrival of a great or small misfortune.</p>
<p>Finally, before half a section of incense had been burned, it was the women's shouts that first raised the heads of the kneeling men. Swarms of locusts flew over from the western sky like snowflakes, landing on the threshing ground, in the fields, jumping, jumping wildly everywhere. Disaster has come. The women cried, "Heavens, Bodhisattvas!" The children wailed along. The men, turning pale with anxiety, grabbed the iron and copper gongs that could be banged to make noise and ran to the fields, first running to the wheat fields and paddies, only to see locusts all over the ridges and furrows, but they had not yet used their sharp, scissor-like mouths to bite the wheat ears, but were just tired, as if recuperating. "Bodhisattvas protect us, Meng Jiang has sealed the mouths of the insects, they won't open their mouths, and will save the lives of us people!" Everyone thought so in their hearts, expanding the power of the gods to the highest degree.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Sixth Grandpa knelt for a long time in front of the Meng Jiang Temple, vowing: "If their mouths don't open, we will hire a troupe to perform a play to thank the gods, and consecrate the temple!" Before he could finish speaking, the sound of copper gongs and iron instruments, people crying and shouting, and the sky falling, sounded throughout the fields and nearby villages. The locusts flew in the sky like a torrential rain, biting like silkworms eating mulberry leaves in the wheat fields. In an instant, some of the wheat stalks that were half a man tall were broken at the roots and fell down, and some had their ears broken off and hanging. The tender seedlings, only three inches tall, were gnawed leaving only the roots. It's over!</p>
<p>Sixth Grandpa's vow to pray to the gods could not stop the mouths of the locusts, and the copper and iron instruments that everyone was banging could not scare away the swarm of locusts. Only Gui Sheng and his son fought the locusts with brooms, beating half a ditch of locusts to death and preserving more than one mu of rice fields. But in the locust plague where "locust nymphs leave no green grass," it is not yet known whether these surviving rice fields can be preserved.</p>
<p>From then on, Shangxing and the surrounding villages fell into a state after a death attack, and the area of this state extended with the locusts flying and jumping wildly.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Reducing Rent</h3>
<p>— Ji Chong</p>
<p>The rent reduction movement, which seemed to have subsided on the surface, has once again attracted the attention of the general public due to the conversations between the parties involved in the municipal council's convocation movement, the publication of specific opinions by the Real Estate Association and the Rent Reduction Promotion Association, and the petition submitted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the municipal government requesting the formulation of rent reduction measures. Because I feel that this issue is important, I am offering a few opinions here to the general readers, hoping that this will further arouse everyone's attention to the issue, and then try to solve this problem.</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>In the past six or seven years, the collapse of the rural economy and the decline of industry and commerce in various places have resulted in a large amount of cash flowing into Shanghai from the interior. According to statistics, in recent years, the amount of cash flowing into Shanghai from the countryside has been as high as 500 to 600 million yuan. However, Shanghai's industry and commerce have also been declining in recent years, and everyone is unwilling to invest in general industry and commerce. Therefore, such a large amount of cash flowing into Shanghai from the interior, as well as the capital originally existing in Shanghai, in addition to being used for securities investment and all kinds of speculative activities, most of it is invested in real estate and in the construction of houses. The Shanghai Real Estate Association stated in its written opinion to the Municipal Council on the issue of rent reduction: "In the past eight years, newly built buildings were worth about 500 million yuan, and adding the old buildings, it should be around 2 billion yuan." This is clear evidence of the development of the construction industry in Shanghai in recent years.</p>
<p>At the same time, the collapse of the rural economy and the unrest in inland society have caused a large population to flow to Shanghai. Therefore, although the number of houses in Shanghai has increased greatly in recent years, rents have not decreased at all, but have increased a lot. In the past six or seven years, the standard index of 260 kinds of daily necessities in Shanghai has fallen by 20%, while rents have increased by 12%. This further explains why people are willing to invest in real estate rather than in industry and commerce.</p>
<p>However, the decline of general industry and commerce will inevitably lead to the bankruptcy, unemployment, and impoverishment of a large number of people, and even make it difficult for them to eat and live in houses. Even the Real Estate Association knows: "Recently, factories in the eastern district have declined, commerce in the central district is particularly depressed, and the northern district has not yet recovered from its wounds. Only the western district has expanded greatly, and residents have difficulty making a living, often moving from large houses to small houses, and renting out houses by dividing them. Thus, the general public cannot continue to bear this excessive rent, and the issue of rent reduction has arisen, and the rent reduction movement has expanded day by day. According to the "Shen Bao" on February 20, there are already more than a dozen countries participating in the rent reduction movement, and among foreigners, Japanese, Russians and Indians are the most numerous.</p>
<p>The occurrence and expansion of the rent reduction movement is not only displeasing to those who manage real estate, but also makes the giants of the financial world very unhappy. Because the latter, in addition to managing their own real estate, also accept mortgages on other people's real estate. If rents are really reduced, the huge profits they make in managing real estate and in mortgage loans will inevitably be reduced by a lot. Therefore, as soon as the rent reduction issue was raised, they expressed their opposition. They said that the real estate market has been declining recently, and once rents are reduced, the huge capital invested in real estate will inevitably be affected; the result will not only affect finance, but also hinder the prosperity of the market, and the impact on society will be not shallow. However, on the other hand, in the midst of this economic downturn and difficult livelihood, the general industrialists, merchants and most of the citizens are unable to continue to bear the excessive rent; if such high rents as they are now cannot be reduced, then bankruptcy, unemployment and other phenomena will inevitably become more widespread and profound. In this way, the two sides are at loggerheads, and the problem has not been resolved until now.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the owners of houses in Shanghai are not only the giants of the Chinese financial world, but also foreign rich men, and they all have the greatest authority in Shanghai. Even the Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently stated in its petition to the municipal government that it "is limited by the power of capital" and "dare not lightly agree" to the rent reduction movement. Under these circumstances, if the general public does not make greater efforts, it is afraid that it will be very problematic to want the rent reduction movement to have good results.</p>
<p>However, in any case, a large number of industrialists and merchants are closing down because they cannot afford the excessive rent, and a large number of people are being driven to shacks and even the streets because they cannot pay the excessive rent: these phenomena are always very serious. The impact of this serious phenomenon on market prosperity and social order must be much greater than the loss of a little profit by a few real estate owners. Therefore, I hope that the municipal authorities can pay special attention to it and fairly resolve this issue of rent reduction; naturally, the general public also needs to make greater efforts to realize their hopes.</p>
<h3>In the Laboratory</h3>
<p>— Xue Wen</p>
<p>I remember four years ago, I came from a university in the interior to this society. Because my "academic" performance was good (the "knowledge" of a university student is naturally limited), I was grateful to the president of the university for hiring me as a teaching assistant in the Department of Sociology of the Faculty of Arts. The career problem that every young person who comes out of university faces was easily solved in this way, and I couldn't help but rejoice in my heart; but after starting work, I found that I should be more worried than happy.</p>
<p>The first thing that bothers people is their own lack of academic ability. I only peddled a little superficial knowledge in college, and I didn’t even fully acquire tool knowledge like English, which inevitably caused obstacles in my work, and therefore I couldn’t make the expected progress in my research work.</p>
<p>Secondly, the heavy burden of complicated work will prevent you from having any ease and leisure in your mind. You have to get to the laboratory at eight o'clock in the morning and work there until twelve o'clock: after a lunch break, you work from one o'clock to five o'clock. You have to work eight hours a day like this, and only the weekly holiday is your own day.</p>
<p>This kind of laboratory life should be welcomed by every person who studies. But the person who said this did not really understand the content of laboratory life. The "chores" inside are more than the "research". This kind of teaching assistant is also a librarian, draftsman, custodian, secretary, general affairs, etc. at the same time, and these jobs are exceptionally mechanical and exceptionally dull.</p>
<p>For example, the work of grading papers and marking scores is definitely not welcome. Our director teaches two sociology courses, each class has one hundred and thirty to forty people, totaling two hundred and sixty to seventy papers. He has to give an exam every three or four weeks. Often, the first batch of exam papers has just been returned, and the second batch is coming again. These exam questions have to be prepared by you. Ordinary essay questions are not important because there are few questions. Once you encounter test questions, you have to find one hundred questions in the not-so-many teaching materials, which is really not easy. Collecting and organizing materials is also a mechanical and complicated task. We are willing to read newspapers, but we are not willing to cut out and paste useful materials from newspapers, even though we know that this is beneficial. After pasting, we also need to classify and organize according to their nature for reference and inspection. Every day, we have to spend more than three hours on three or four kinds of Chinese and Western newspapers.</p>
<p>Drawing is also an important and complicated research work. During my year as a teaching assistant, I drew many pictures about anthropology, demography, social investigation and special research. Each picture takes at least eight or nine hours, and difficult pictures take three to five days of your time. There is a map of the distribution density of population around the world, I remember I spent almost four days on it.</p>
<p>There are also some "special researches" that require you to spend a lot of time. For example, the investigation and statistics of family problems and marriage problems, the analysis of famous people in various dynasties and the distribution of geography in research, the local practical investigation of urban society and rural society, and problems such as suicide, crime, and unemployment all require you to share a part of your energy. Although students are responsible for these topics, you have to assist them in the position of a mentor, and you must also study a topic alone, otherwise you will have no performance in research, and the tragedy of the result is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>There are also nearly 30 kinds of Chinese and English sociology publications and 200 to 300 sociology books in the laboratory, and the responsibility of managing these undoubtedly falls on you. When each new book is reported, you have to register it on the card, and when you lend it out, you have to go through all the borrowing procedures for books and newspapers with the students.</p>
<p>Also, during the exam, you have to issue papers and invigilate. This has a difficulty, some of these students are your friends, or friends of your friends; not long ago we were all "classmates", now can I put on a straight face in front of them and interfere with them cheating? If you are really so "arrogant", you may encounter indecision. So in this case, you have to pretend to be careless, as if you are blind, and have not seen them doing things that damage their personality. Grading the papers has the same difficulty as this. For example, the papers are only worth fifty-seven or eight points, you can't help but give them a passing grade.</p>
<p>The kind of life mentioned above will inevitably make people feel mentally tired and thirsty for rest. Sleep is sweet in such a situation, and this was not experienced in college days.</p>
<p>The reward for such hard work is 60 yuan per month. This is neither too much nor too little. I heard that a teaching assistant at a certain university in Shanghai only has 30 yuan a month. There must be a reason why a college student who has spent two or three thousand yuan (calculated for four years, at least 500 yuan per year) is willing to sell knowledge labor at such a low price: one is that it is not easy to find a job, and the other is to obtain a good qualification (a qualification second only to that of a professor). It's good to go to the interior and sell it at a high price. This is the situation in private universities. Teaching assistants in national or provincial universities receive 80 to 100 yuan per month. If you can teach some classes in high school, the income will be even more considerable. However, this kind of luck is not common, unless you have a special relationship with the school authorities.</p>

<h3>Titled The Fragrant Smoke of Miaofeng Mountain</h3>
<p>— Bi Mei</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence</p>
<p>Miaofeng Mountain is located in the northwest of Beiping. It is said that the Holy Mother of Miaofeng Mountain is very efficacious, so every year, the pious men and women who go to the mountain to offer incense are very crowded.</p>
<p>On the first day of the fourth lunar month this year, the temple gate was wide open. Because the situation was unstable last year, many people did not offer incense, so this year's incense is more prosperous than in previous years. What is even more different from previous years is that foreigners from the East and the West also followed our country's pious men and women to the mountain to offer incense. There were quite a few of them. When the pious men and women of Europe went down the mountain, they also wrapped their heads in yellow cloth towels and inserted velvet flowers. Beiping calls this "returning home with a blessing", and I think these foreign men and women also have this kind of thinking?</p>
<p>Miaofeng Mountain is so high, so the top of the mountain is often covered with snow. People who go to offer incense must bring cotton clothes with them, because the top of the mountain is so cold, it is like another world compared to the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Here, there is no distinction between the rich and the poor. All that is seen are the old, the young, the men and the women, all busily going up the mountain to offer incense. Some are repaying vows for the illnesses of their parents, husbands, wives, and children, taking one step and kowtowing once, taking three steps and kowtowing once. The mountain is so high that it takes several days to reach the temple at the top of the mountain. The rich can go up by sedan chair, and the poor can only use their feet as a car. Those who walk slowly can reach it in one or two days.</p>
<p>There are small shops beside the mountain where you can stay overnight, and there are small food stalls where you can buy food to fill your stomach. What is strange is that money is not a concern. The rich can give more, and the poor give less. They don’t argue about it.</p>
<p>It is said that you have to say good things when you go up the mountain. If your heart is not sincere, you will not be able to reach the top of the mountain. Even if you try your best to climb up, you will fall down. Also, you cannot say: "Oh! My shoes are going to break!" Then your shoes will really break and you will not be able to go up the mountain. On the contrary, even if your shoes are already broken, but you don't care at all and sincerely want to offer incense, then until you return home after offering incense, the shoes will still be the same as</p>
<h3>Living Circle</h3>
<p>— Bai Yu</p>
<p>The morning sun, faintly revealing lead-gray cloud cover, golden arrows of light, lifted the gauze of dense fog, dawn, alternating in the breath of darkness.</p>
<p>The silhouette of the city's side. The authority-wielding whistle, shrieking sharply, shattered the bitter dreams of countless laborers buried in life.</p>
<p>Strings of dark black smoke, belched angrily from towering cloud-peaked chimneys, destroying the sweat and blood of exploitation.</p>
<p>On the hunger line, a group of exhausted coolies struggled, their trembling steps, entering the tiger's mouth that dominates life.</p>
<p>The sound of machinery under the rotation of motors, the miserable cries under the lashes of whips, symphonized into the decline of the world.</p>
<p>Hot wind, carrying spiciness, hot wind flying from the equator. But, unable to awaken the universe intoxicated in a pink atmosphere.</p>
<p>Wooden axles, tapping on rough stone roads, cut through the loneliness of the air.</p>
<p>A chaotic dawn road, etched with chaotic human traces, imprinted with a chaotic car shadow.</p>
<p>Morning wind, swirling the dust and sand on the cement, black wooden boxes, burying them.</p>
<p>A dark sauce face, a withered, tattered, dirty hat, red clothes, all symbolizing that he is a street cleaner under the rolling wheels.</p>
<p>The city's garbage, no, the city's sins! Wore away his tiny life.</p>
<p>A lively vigor, permeated the living circle of the early market.</p>
<p>The sound of people, the long neighs of horses, everything, people surviving in a sea of madness.</p>
<p>The disappearance of Little Liu Zi's car, the police caught Eight Hands [a thief], scientific spirit mediums [Ouija boards] were popular all over the streets, bargain sale flags fluttered all year round, everything. A deformed society, revealing its true nature.</p>
<p>In the center of the street, a group of young girls, they sang with affection: Selling flowers! Pearl flowers! White orchid!</p>
<p>Scarlet roses, reflecting scarlet faces, clear singing, stirring the restless hearts of everyone: sad emotions, disappearing with the withered flowers. Swallow-like they are, innocent, beautiful. They do not know that the iron chains of life have already tightly locked their youthful lives, pitiful! They never even imagined that the black shadow of urban sin, has surrounded their entire fragile soul.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Just like when I first came, it won't be too broken.</p>
<p>On the way up the mountain, everyone smiles and nods to each other. There is no hypocrisy, ferocity, no class consciousness here, everyone is as close as a family, helping each other, so the road is not lonely.</p>
<p>The temple on the top of the mountain is very large, and pilgrims can live inside, and vegetarian dishes are served every day to feed the pious men and women. Because of the divine efficacy of the Holy Mother of Miaofeng, everyone is happy to obtain a divination slip. It is said that the divination slips of the Holy Mother of Miaofeng are also very efficacious! (?)</p>
<p>In this era, there are the most people who believe in Buddha, and everyone seeks the blessing and help of the old Buddha in everything. On the way from Beiping to Miaofeng Mountain, countless men and women can be seen carrying yellow bundles, wearing yellow scarves around their heads, etc.</p>
<p>The temple is only open once a year, and the mountain gate closes after the tenth day of the fourth month. If you want to offer incense again, you have to wait another year!</p>
<p>The income from incense fees is countless and quite considerable. Generally, people are happy to do good deeds and are willing to donate more money to the Holy Mother of Miaofeng as incense fees, asking her to bless them with peace. But it is not easy to get them to donate to charity.</p>
<p>Even though it is a year of economic bankruptcy and panic is raging everywhere, here, it is still as dignified and luxurious as before, and there is no sign of poverty.</p>

<h3>On Suicide</h3>
<p>— Ms. Lixing</p>
<p>"Suicide, it is too cowardly and takes life too lightly for good young people to willingly commit suicide, even though the environment is so difficult...!"</p>
<p>This is the current criticism of young people who commit suicide.</p>
<p>Living people criticize the dead in order to encourage the living, because the stakes for humans are more closely related than for other closely related animals, so the impact is also greater. In fact, we are shocked when we hear that someone has committed suicide, especially those of the same class, and it is easier to feel a sense of shared grief. But when we encounter "living dead" (people who waste social wealth, sit and eat without doing anything), we only take it lightly. Fairly speaking, is it better to linger on, endure humiliation and live in shame, since living does not contribute to livelihood, and when you die, you can not only go to the same destination as the wealthy and the rich, return to the realm of death praised in "Keats" "Nightingale Song", where everything disharmonious is harmonious, but also, debts owed to others absolutely do not need to be repaid, which is considered to have reached the realm of equal freedom in spirit, which is much better than living in anger? This is an experimental view of life.</p>
<p>Some people absolutely refuse to commit suicide. These people are always casual in their work and get by in life. When evaluating people and things, they always use the spirit of a female antelope observing the wind and smelling enemies to respond, and they never dare to have their own opinions, so the conclusion is nothing more than yes! yes! The souls of these people are similar to the flying catkins in the spring suburbs, fluttering. Their way of survival is the same as that of horses and cattle, working hard all day long without knowing why, this is a view of life.</p>
<p>Some people look down on suicide and ridicule suicide. These people have a gloomy view of life, do not know about public welfare, and are not confused by spiritual creation. They believe in the philosophy that "justice is the interest of the strong, good people are ignorant, and the important thing is to be wise", and use their life's energy to create personal happiness. If you ask this kind of person what is the meaning of living, he will ask you what is the purpose of human survival. If you think their lives are a waste, they will laugh at your struggle, leaving only a few strands of unsellable hair as a symbol of cowardice. Even if the country is broken and the enemy is approaching, they will never commit suicide or resist out of indignation; because they have long been prepared to go abroad to be world-weary slaves of a fallen country.</p>
<p>There are also some people who express sympathy for those who commit suicide, but they themselves will never commit suicide. Most of these people are strong-willed. They sometimes fall into difficult living conditions, but they are not pessimistic because of this. They express great sympathy for the oppressed, take the suffering of most people as their own suffering, and take the shame of the country and the nation as their own shame; they are actually complete fools, and they suffer more setbacks than ordinary people, but they often enjoy less material pleasure than ordinary people. However, the spiritual realm of such people occupies a larger area than that of ordinary people, if they succeed in something that is beneficial to the masses.</p>
<p>However, such fools are rarely found in the present society; because there are too many smart people in China now, unless they are willing to fight desperately for their own interests, they are almost surprised when they hear the behavior of the above-mentioned fools; therefore, Chinese people may have the same fate as Jews in the future.</p>
<p>In this society with too many smart people, the number of people who die by suicide is increasing day by day, and at the same time, there are more people living in slow suicide; it is just that the former is obvious, but the latter has already stepped onto the former's path while laughing at the former, but they are still not aware of it until death.</p>

<h3>The Apprentice School Founded by American Entrepreneur Ford</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiyun</p>
<p>The apprenticeship system is indeed a very good system, but in our China, there is only dead work, day and night without rest time, like hard labor, which has a great impact on all aspects of underage children, poor development, and the rampage of tuberculosis. It can be said that all these are the result of this kind of life. Now I will introduce the apprentice school run by the American entrepreneur Ford below for the reference of the industrial and commercial circles:</p>
<p>The original purpose of Ford's Apprentice School was to only accept orphans who had no guardians or parents, so that they would have the opportunity to work in the future. Later, the children of Ford employees could also enroll at will. This school of his is to train workers, and its purpose is to create people who can manage their own lives. Not only does he want them to be able to be self-reliant, but also to make them more able to manage a good life than others, but giving them the privilege of working is not to cultivate their dependence, but to cultivate their ability to create and control their own lives. Therefore, according to this method, his school's educational policy</p>
<p>, there are three important points. First, boys are still boys. Don't make them early successful activists. Second, academic studies should go hand in hand with experimentation. Third, it is not divorced from reality education, and his products must be practical and useful. Let's look at his detailed implementation of this article below.</p>
<p>(1) Children should naturally be treated like children, and children's nature should be encouraged. Observing children in factories and classrooms is to make them see their own light, to make them have the consciousness of being their own "masters", to make them know that they are doing things for themselves, to make them feel interested and necessary to be enthusiastic, to make them want to learn what children should learn, and to learn the questions that they want to ask at home but no one answers them.</p>
<p>Even if children want to be workers, they must not forget that they are children. This point is the most important. After their products are inspected, they are sold to Ford Motor Company as funding for the school. If there are bad products, it will be a loss to the school. Therefore, students and schools must cheer up and work hard, and unknowingly, they have developed a sense of responsibility for doing things. Therefore, the school's factory also gives them bonuses ranging from seven yuan and two cents to eighteen yuan a week. After they graduate, they will not only have a general education, but also have considerable professional knowledge. Their skills are as skilled as adults, so they can go to any factory to do things. If they are willing to continue their studies, they can also work part-time and study part-time with considerable proficiency, and get higher wages. There is no regulation that they must work in the Ford factory after graduation.</p>
<p>(2) Knowledge and technology cannot advance at the same time. This is the second principle. Dead knowledge and book knowledge are not the knowledge of workers. It must be living knowledge and practical knowledge. Naturally, technology cannot be obtained by relying solely on prototype practice. Therefore, their textbooks are the Ford factory. For example, the arithmetic taught is a practical and useful problem in the actual activities of the factory.</p>
<p>Geography is also the same. It asks: What ship should you take to send a car to Singapore? Which way to go? Even the list receipts are shown to them. This is how it is pushed to all parts of the world, and the real commercial routes are explained to them in detail one by one. The physics and chemistry taught are also the same. The teachers explain from the actual situation, and the students also ask from the actual situation, disassembling the machines one by one to explain, and then teaching them how to install them so that they can turn. If students want to make noble and subtle products, they must understand the corresponding difficult problems, and they must also explain them in detail. And they often have to learn to repair machines.</p>
<p>(3) It is not allowed to hurt the self-esteem of students, the self-esteem of producing goods by their own activities, to help increase their sense of responsibility, this is the third concept. Therefore, they must work at school, and they are also paid for their work. At the Ford School, at the beginning, one-third of the day was spent teaching in the classroom, and two-thirds of the day was spent teaching work in the factory. Later, I learned that changing like this in one day greatly hindered their progress. Now it is stipulated that they will teach in the classroom for one week and teach work in the factory for two weeks.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned academic courses and internships, there are also games and gymnastics, which are the same as ordinary schools. On Fridays, there are also many meetings in the purchasing hall, where they can freely discuss.</p>
<p>The facilities of the Ford Apprentice School are like this. I wonder how the agencies in China that implement the apprenticeship system will feel after reading it.</p>

<h3>On Promoting Physical Education</h3>
<p>— Shao Wen</p>
<p>In recent years, our old China seems to be talking about being modern. Advocating something, reviving something, has become our most modern slogan. If everyone really "works hard" and "works hard" according to these modern slogans, then the old China may become an American-style modern country. However, unfortunately, when we advocate domestic products, those modern girls and young masters specialize in buying foreign goods; when we work hard to revive the rural movement, those rich masters and wives insist on depositing their gold and silver treasures in foreign banks instead of taking them to the rural areas to circulate. As a result, the movement to promote domestic products failed: as a result, rural finance was in trouble, and the entire movement to revive rural areas achieved no results.</p>
<p>However, things cannot always be generalized. Although we have failed in other movements and have no achievements, we have gained a lot in promoting physical education. Look, how lively are the local sports meets, the national sports meets, and the Far Eastern Games! Every time these sports meets are held, large and small newspapers across the country have to publicize and promote them with the largest amount of space; today, a certain female wolf is published in the place where she is powerful, and tomorrow, a certain soldier wins the championship alone. The tension of the situation is no less than the arrival of World War II! 丨丨 From this, we can see how enthusiastic and unified people are about promoting physical education, and how great achievements our movement to promote physical education has shown!</p>
<p>However, I don't know what the meaning of promoting physical education in this way is. I think that physical education can only be regarded as a part of our daily homework and should not be regarded as the only important task. If young people always run, jump, swim, play ball, and engage in physical education, regardless of everything, what kind of people will they become as a result? What contributions will they make to the country, society, academic, and culture besides being able to run and jump? This is not difficult to imagine. At the same time, the purpose of physical education should be to strengthen the body, not to compete for victory and show off like gambling. However, the physical education we are promoting now is promoting it as a specialized career. The students of various physical education schools, all athletes, in addition to exercising all day long, not only do not ask about all issues related to the country and society, but even do not study various academic subjects. Look, aren't nine out of ten athletes simple-minded and uneducated? As for the purpose of their exercising all day long, it is of course to want to be athletes, go to sports meets, and win championships. 丨丨 Promoting physical education like this is obviously for other purposes.</p>
<p>Some people say that promoting physical education can save the country. If the people of the whole country become strong due to the promotion of physical education, wouldn't the country become strong? That's right, if the country wants to be strong, the people must be healthy. If the people are all weak and sick, the country will not be strong, but it cannot be said that as long as the people have healthy bodies, the country will be rich and strong. The natives of Africa, the blacks of America, and the Indian Asans are all very strong, but they don't even have a country now. At the same time, the health of the people's bodies cannot be obtained by promoting physical education in this way. We know that people who have no food to eat, no clothes to wear, and suffer from hunger and cold, pain and sorrow, will never be healthy no matter what. At present, most of the Chinese people are unemployed, poor, hungry, and under the attack of cold. Under this situation, it is a dream to try to promote physical education in this way to strengthen the bodies of the people and thus save the country from danger?</p>
<p>In fact, all the disasters in China are directly or indirectly caused by imperialism. To revitalize China, there is no need to promote physical education in this way, but we need to lead the Chinese people to rise up and fight against imperialism with correct methods. I dare to assert that if the Chinese people all rise up to save the country, China can immediately get rid of all disasters! On the contrary, if we want the general public to ignore all issues related to the country and society and only promote gambling-like physical education, the result will be that even if we win all the championships in the global sports meet, the danger of the country will not be eliminated because of this.</p>
<p>"Winning glory for the country" is what people often use to encourage the "athletes" who go abroad to participate in sports meets. Its meaning is: Although everything is inferior to others, if our "athletes" win in some sports meet abroad, then the country will be very glorious. Therefore, we should promote physical education to "win glory for the country". This is completely an expression of Ah Qism! The land of the country has been taken away province by province, and the people of the whole country are suffering from the bullying and oppression of imperialism. Instead of trying to reform ourselves, we want to promote physical education to "win glory for the country". Apart from the Ah Q Mr. who is good at deceiving and comforting himself, I am afraid no one can do it.</p>
<p>Moreover, to be honest, if we are always so backward and the country always maintains this state, then we will not be able to win any "glory" in any global sports meet or Far Eastern Games. The fact that the Far Eastern Games were manipulated by Japan this time is a clear example.</p>

<h3>Mobile Bookstore</h3>
<p>— Shaqi</p>
<p>Following the start of the second five-year plan, in every "collective farm" and farmer dormitory in the Soviet countryside, during the spring plowing and sowing and the autumn harvest and distribution of grain seasons, large numbers of motorcycle trucks loaded with various books suitable for farmers to read came to sell to farmers at extremely low prices. Each truck is a bookstore, and they call these motorcycles "mobile bookstores". In addition to selling books, they also come with film projectors and radios, showing and broadcasting the best programs for free, so that ordinary farmers can receive good education while being entertained.</p>
<p>"Mobile Bookstores" are organized directly by the "Central Book Society" of the People's Culture and Education Committee of the Central Soviet. The "Central Book Society" sets up a Turkish-style kiosk in each "political division" in the countryside, which can also be said to be a book station. Each kiosk is equipped with a motorcycle truck loaded with books, etc., and drives around the farms and dormitories.</p>
<p>Before the spring plowing this year (1934), the People's Culture and Education Committee of Moscow mobilized 1,000 members to go to the countryside to participate in their "Central Book Society". One thousand new Turkish-style kiosks were added, three hundred of which were set up in collective farms, specifically for general sowing farmers to purchase, and two hundred were attached to the railway transportation bureau. The "Central Book Society" has now opened 3,520 kiosks, and it is expected that it will increase to 4,500 by the autumn harvest season of this year.</p>
<p>In order to make it easier for ordinary farmers to approach the thoughts of literature and art, the "Central Book Society" implemented the resolution of the People's Culture and Education Committee last year and compiled a catalog of books specifically for the people of the countryside to read. This includes 85 famous literary and artistic works that have been handed over to the National Publishing Department for printing. In order to make it easier for farmers to examine and select the books they love, the "Central Book Society" has specially used the most simple language to make detailed explanations under each catalog. The National Publishing Department also uses large-sized type to print, so that ordinary farmers can read it without any effort.</p>
<p>During the spring plowing this year, the "Central Book Society" transported 100 packages of new books from Moscow to the kiosks in the political divisions of each township every day, and then circulated from there to various collective farms. The readers here have now obtained 6.5 million volumes of literary and artistic books.</p>
<h3>The State Retail Industry in the Five-Year Plan</h3>
<p>— Li Ren</p>
<p>The rapid growth of the Soviet national economy is accompanied by the development of the state retail trade. The reason for such growth and development is undoubtedly the improvement of the general people's living conditions.</p>
<p>Based on the massive development of heavy industry, the reconstruction of the socialist rural economy, and the increase in commodity production, the development of light industry, whether in terms of production quantity or the reconstruction of the technical base, has become very possible.</p>
<p>The development of light industry is the driving force behind the prosperity of the state retail industry.</p>
<p>In the past eleven years, the trade volume of the Soviet state retail industry was only 3,560,000,000 rubles in 1922/23, but increased to 39,900,000,000 rubles in 1932 (the total for eleven years).</p>
<p>Due to the development of state retail industry and cooperative organizations, private capital trade has been excluded from the market.</p>
<p>In 1922/23, private trade accounted for 75.3 percent of the total national trade; this percentage dropped to 5.8 percent by 1930, and by 1931, this type of private operation had completely lost its position.</p>
<p>The Soviet state retail industry began to develop in 1930, and reached its peak in 1931 and 1932. The trade volume in 1930 was only 2,500,000,000 rubles, rose to 6,500,000,000 rubles in 1931, and increased to 8,000,000,000 rubles in 1932.</p>
<p>The state retail industry is managed by a commercial committee, through large retail stores, and many commercial trusts specializing in selling a certain type of goods. For example, the meat industry trust, under which many stores specialize in selling meat. The milk trust specializes in supplying daily milk. The fish industry trust specializes in supplying the public with various fish foods.</p>
<p>In addition, there are sales organizations specializing in selling a certain type of common daily necessities. For example, many stores of the clothing industry trust specialize in selling clothing. Many stores of the textile trust specialize in selling textiles, and so on.</p>
<p>In addition to these special stores, there are also department stores containing various departments; customers can buy all kinds of goods they want here.</p>
<p>The Soviet planned economy enables more than 300,000 of the above-mentioned various stores to serve the vast public interest in the most suitable and convenient places.</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that under this state retail system, there is also the establishment of model stores that use modern commercial technology and pay attention to how to serve customers. The organization of common commercial affairs, the precise measurement of goods, the maximum use of mechanical commercial equipment, the application of the "cash on delivery" system, the quick delivery of goods to the buyer's home, etc., these are the characteristics of this model store.</p>
<p>The state retail industry organization also includes many food and beverage stores, such as hotels, cafeterias, kitchen factories, etc., which also serve the vast public interest.</p>
<p>The development of the state retail industry and cooperatives has followed the prosperity of trade in collective farms. Collective farmers and individual small farmers bring their surplus goods to the city and sell them to state commercial organizations at prevailing prices.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the Second Five-Year Plan, special attention should be paid to specialized trust industries, that is, special attention should be paid to the supply of clothing, shoes and socks, and groceries; the same attention should also be paid to the supply of food raw materials such as butter, fish, and meat, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to these, the Second Five-Year Plan also stipulates that many large department stores should be opened, and many high-rise buildings have now been built for this type of store.</p>
<p>The planned increase of the state retail industry, in the Second Five-Year Plan, pays the same attention to the interests of workers and collective farmers. This enables the planned development of Soviet commerce and commercial technology to become a high-speed leap.</p>
<h3>Attention Unemployed Friends</h3>
<p>A certain company now wishes to hire an English night school tutor to teach six or seven trainees, from 7:00 to 9:00, with Sundays off, and a monthly salary of twenty yuan. Those who believe they are competent should prepare a letter of resume in English and send it to Mr. Wang Binxian, No. 51 Zhifu Road.</p>
<p>I am now planning to hire a family assistant (female), under the age of 30, from Jiangsu or Zhejiang province, with a strong body, peaceful disposition, slightly educated, able to take on all household operations, and who has a guarantor in Shanghai is qualified. Those who can also take on writing work are especially welcome. Those who wish to apply can send a letter to Zou Zuotong at Shanghai University, Yangshupu.</p>
<p>Scientific Miscellany</p>
<h3>Aviation Saves the Nation: The Story of the Invention of the Airship (1)</h3>
<p>— Shulin</p>
<p>I. Longing for the Flight of Birds</p>
<p>When we were young, when we saw birds flying freely in the air, we thought in our hearts: "How pleasant it would be if we could fly like that too!"</p>
<p>When the wheat is ripe, walking in the countryside, many swallows turn their white bellies and fly back and forth. When we see it, we hope that we will also become swallows.</p>
<p>Flying in the air is the greatest hope of mankind since the beginning of time. No matter which country's mythology, there must be angels with wings or heavenly horses with flying feathers appearing, flying freely in the air. From this, we can understand how much people in the past longed for flying.</p>
<p>However, until recently, it was absolutely impossible for humans to fly in the air. The famous Wright brothers flew in the air with their own invented airplane in 1903, only twenty or thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Here, we cannot but know: the invention of the airplane took the precious time, money, and even sometimes the loss of their own lives of countless people to succeed.</p>
<p>"The airplane was invented by Wright, it is the result of Wright's painstaking efforts, ——" In fact, it is not as simple as that. Before Wright's invention, there were already countless people who died silently with grievances because they could not achieve their goals.</p>
<p>An invention can never be accomplished by the power of one person. Most people accumulate research, little by little, and once create an invention. Before the invention, who knows how much sacrifice has been paid!</p>
<p>II. The Origin of Balloons</p>
<p>There are various distinctions between machines that fly in the air. Now, let's divide them roughly into two categories:</p>
<p>1. Machines heavier than air</p>
<p>2. Machines lighter than air</p>
<p>Machines heavier than air are the current airplanes. The machine itself is heavier than air and cannot float in the air statically. On the contrary, machines lighter than air are the current airships. The machine itself is lighter than air and can float quietly in the air like a moon floating in the sea. (To be continued)</p>
