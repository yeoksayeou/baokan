<p>軍縮失敗。已成定局。各國擴充軍備。亦已劍及屨及。勢難挽回。世界局勢之嚴動。較之大戰前夕有過之而無不及。英國處此局勢之中。關係最大。無論大戰發生於歐西或遠東。其利益實無往而不受威脅。其行動亦無往而不顯舉足重輕之勢。其謀國之士。亟圖所以自保。此固人情之常。誰得而非議之。然而今日正因其所處地位。與東西各國關係鉅。利害切。牽一髮可動全身。故宜格外鄭重。夫以英帝國之大。倘於此時僅圖自保而不作進一步强有力之表示以遏制方興未艾之巨患。則一旦大勢所趨。此退彼進。將至欲自全而不得矣。史家謂一九零四年英法恊約成立。英外相葛雷如能於當時十年中。以堅决之宣言昭告中歐諸國。曰誰欲破壞和平者。英必援法以臨之。則歐戰浩刦。或可避免。當時英國之所以不出於此。固自有其不得已之苦衷。然而史家所言。亦非全然無據。奈何西門外相不以此爲殷鑒。急圖所以補救。而反爲九國公約作此新解。吾人料其影響所及。不僅暗示野心者以可乘之機。且無異由此視九國公約爲廢紙。英工黨領袖克利浦斯抨擊其政府對日政策爲慫恿爲姑息。非無故也。</p>
<p>夫以獨立自主國家之領土完整。欲賴他人代爲保證原爲莫大之恥辱。九國公約成立。原不過欲確定各國東之均勢政策。西門外相前於下院辯論日本對華新政策時。曾調英將堅持九國公約所明定之權利與義務。其時固明言權利與義務並重也。今忽又謂領土完整之尊重與保證有别。意果何在條約一死物耳。如何運用。作何解釋。以及如何維持如何取捨。固仍在締約國主要人之手。我不過爲貧弱而無力之一份子。當然任人解釋任人玩弄。然則我國人敎冀乞援正義之夢。不可稍醒乎。</p>

<h3>日内瓦談話目標　排除蘇俄加入國聯障碍　小恊約承認僅時日問題</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）今日各方面對於法外長巴爾都及蘇俄外委李維諾夫之晤談、均極注意、巴李二氏今日下午自三時至四時半舉行談話、各報記者探悉此事、卽蠭集旅舍、訪問談話内容、維巴李自始至終不肯宣布究竟、李维諾夫僅言彼之來此、係討論一切時局問題者、究屬何問題、彼復不肯言、但衆悉所謂時局問題者、不外蘇俄加入國聯之問題而已、再則羅馬尼亞外長鐵杜樓斯哥氏明日亦將抵此、鐵氏將繼續與李維諾夫商談彼等前在巴黎所已開始之問題云、並聞日後蘇俄加入國聯成爲永久會員國之後、波蘭亦將要求在理事會中佔一永久席次、但此尙不足爲蘇俄加入國聯之阻碍、而最大之阻碍、厥爲瑞士堅持不承認蘇俄之主張云、（十八日</p>
<p>國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）自昨晚蘇俄我交委員長李維諾夫與法國外長巴爾都作長時間之會商後、此間負責方面益信蘇俄已决定加入國聯、國聯方面之法代表雖守緘默、然彼等承認二人所談之主要問題爲蘇俄之加入國聯云、當新聞記者多人以此消息詢問李維諾夫時、彼卽笑而言他曰、『今日宜於釣遊、然乎、』可靠方面咸認蘇俄外交委員長適於此時蒞此、實爲蘇俄政府預備正式討論此問題之明白表示、羅馬尼亞外長鐵杜樓斯哥不久亦將抵此、與李維諾夫會議、益證此説之有力、政治觀察者稱、法國期待蘇俄之加入國聯、於今尤切、蓋以最近巴爾都外長華沙之行、未能全部成功也、同時小恊約方面承認波蘭</p>
<p>顯欲與法分道揚鏣、甚有謂波蘭現擬脱離國聯而加入德日集團、此種集團、意國他日或亦將加入云、今晨高級外交家深信李維諾夫與鐵杜樓斯哥之會見、將爲小恊約承認蘇俄之地步、所謂小恊約卽羅馬尼亞·南斯拉夫·及捷克、小恊約之承認、將爲蘇俄加入國聯之又一根據、此間僉信鐵杜樓斯哥實卽秘密被派爲小恊約之代表、蓋以羅馬尼亞與蘇俄之關係、較南斯拉夫捷克與蘇俄之關係更爲複雜也、如於比薩拉比亞問題並無困難、而外交家亦信决無困難發生、則承認之舉、僅時間問題耳、小恊約之承認蘇俄將爲李維諾夫之又一勝利、蓋美俄復交後、南美各國亦將一致承認蘇俄云、如小恊約與蘇俄復交、則歐洲之未與蘇俄和諧者、僅荷蘭·比利時·葡萄牙·瑞士·匈牙利·及保加利亞六國而已、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）各報咸認外長巴爾都與蘇俄外委李維諾夫在日内瓦之會晤、自軍縮問題言之、實有極重大性質、並謂兩人會晤之主要目標、厥爲蘇俄之加入國聯會一事、『小巴黎人報』謂、『巴爾都與李維諾夫若非商議蘇俄加入國聯會、則兩人所談者究爲何事乎、外傳蘇俄加入國聯會、必當附以條件、例如訂立歐洲各國互助公約、依照蘇俄與其鄰國所訂互不侵犯條約之先例、而將侵侵略國之優美定義載入匣聯會盟約、或載入限制軍備公約、比比皆是、除此以外、尙有小恊商各國立卽承認蘇俄一層、亦必討論及之』、『日報』謂、『蘇俄入盟問題之演進、足以影響法俄邦交、若訂立歐洲互助公約、將法國各種防禦同盟條約包括在内、尤足以促進俄法兩國邦交、巴爾都與李維諾夫在日内瓦之談話、必着重此兩點、當無疑問』、該報又謂、『巴爾都與李維諾夫之會晤、』、雙方均不願有所發表、但其内容、實係蘇俄加入國聯會計劃、法國於此、當担負介紹人之任務、至少蘇俄方面係作如此説法』、『愛克西有報』謂、『蘇俄入盟所遭遇之最大困難、在於波蘭方面、因波蘭主張蘇俄如取得行政院常任會員、則波蘭亦要求畀以此席也、』巴黎廻聲報謂、『蘇俄加入國聯會、將於九月間國聯大會决定之、因此事惟大會有定奪之權』云云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）據法國官塲方面聲稱、蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫抵此後、曾與法國外長巴爾都會談法俄兩國關係問題、李維諾夫今晚業已啓程前往法國上薩伏瓦省、頃巴黎『愛克西有報』對於此事、發表有興趣之記載、略謂『李維諾夫之旅行另有目的、蓋蘇俄反幹部派領袖特羅資基易名割鬚、隱居上薩伏瓦省、而莫斯科方面亦欲特氏自行悔、李維諾夫之赴上薩伏瓦、據吾人所知、乃在勸告特氏、使之與蘇俄當局言歸於、特氏固蘇俄獨裁者史丹林之舊友也』云云、（十九哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國聯行政院會議卽將結束　薩爾問題協定成立　英禁運軍火案通過</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯會行政院薩爾問題特種委員會主席意大利代表阿樂西亞、本日與法國外長巴爾都晤談、當經决定行政院於明日開會、將薩爾委員會工作結論及其建議提出審閲、委員會對於所提建議、將一致要求行政院加以通過、聞委員會所擬解决辦法、足使法國各項正當要求獲得滿足云、一般人以爲本届行政院會期、明日卽可結束、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）法外長巴爾都今日在此語人、謂薩爾流域問題之恊定、業已成立、將立卽提交國聯行政院云、至於德國對此已否同意、及此恊定已否决定薩爾公民投票大會日期、與曾否規定對於投票反對以薩爾隸屬德國者予以安全保障、則巴爾都不願有何説明、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）英國現凖備無論何時一經佈置、便可倍增其空軍力量、而躍至空軍國中之第一位置、此爲昨日包爾溫在下院發言之意義、包爾溫此言披露如何可一躍而爲第一等空軍國之一部份計劃、已引起濃厚之注意、報紙一般意見以爲政府已進行不少工作、飛機塲所業已勘定、而訓練司機員之便利、業已設法增多、再英國飛機與汽車製造廠設備最新、抱有多數飛機之能力、同時尙有數報謂增厚英國空軍力量之追加預算業已擬成云、聞英國所擬締結天空公約之計劃、卽禁止天空轟炸、並規定簽字國同負義務對於違約國、羣起轟炸之者、現已取銷、因閣員一部份不贊同此計劃也、查英國現有飛機一千四百架、而法國則有三千架左右、爲世界空軍最强之國、今聞英國樞密大臣包爾溫之言論、將有何種反動、此亦甚堪注意之一事也、（十九日路透電）</p>

<h3>英國的現勢及其外交英國通信　經濟聯盟漸次形成　國際外交不無顧慮</h3>
<p>英國是老大了、可是她還是竭力要保其特殊的優勢、在歐洲大陸、要支持她舉足重輕的特長、在世界各地也要維持如海上覇王的地位、然而在現時情勢之下、英國旣居心維持現狀抑制德意志保存凡爾賽和約、就不能不干預歐洲大陸的事情、可是這裏有兩種矛盾一種是社會主義的蘇聯發達日趨堅實、歐洲均勢將受她的影響、一種是希特勒黨向－伸長、不但威脅凡爾賽體系、對英國也有很嚴重的關係、假如法意德三角關係一日發生裂痕、甚至於訴諸武力的時候英國又將何以自處、照洛加羅和平條約的規定、法比兩國國境受威脅、英國固然要捲入戰爭漩渦、卽德國侵入波蘭、法國出兵、英國也勢難袖手旁觀、所以英國有很多人主張廢除洛加羅條約、以獲取英國的中立性不過現在的情勢、已經萬難容許其這樣的幽閒、而空軍的發展更令英國不</p>
<p>能孤立因此、英國纔出來努力斡旋歐洲的紛爭、想使差不多要成爲歷史化石的軍備縮小會議復活起來假使軍備縮小會議可以重開、又能得到法德互讓的結果、則歐洲的危險成分至少可以减輕、卽會議不成、也足以使現局延宕維持着暫時不破裂的局面、誠然英國不願德意志恢復世界大戰以前所具的强厚兵力、可是法蘭西充分强力化之後、雖不必就會奪取英國的領士、威脅英國國境及殖民地、自治領的安全、但是在經濟上在財政上却有問題、所以她頗暗中贊許法意德三國的微妙對立關係、</p>
<p>在過去一年餘時間中、美國與法意等重要的資本主義國家、其經濟狀態都日漸衰落、如美國的對外貿易、去年較前年低落了百分之三十、比一九二八年低落了五分之一、然而英國因爲運用經濟聯盟的結果、各自治領和殖民地的離心傾漸次緩慢所以她的一般經濟狀况在世界經濟恐慌狂流中、得到比較可靠的穩定、</p>
<p>在政治上的表現是麥唐納内閣竟能以舉國恊力内閣、實行了中正穩健的政策、國家歲收出入、一九三三年至三四年度赢餘三千一百二十萬鎊、一九三四年至三五年度歲入預計爲七萬萬零六百五十二萬鎊、歲出預計爲七萬萬零五百七十二萬四千鎊、差額還有七十九萬六千鎊的剩餘、又由其關税收入超過預計一千七百萬鎊、由此可見英國對外貿易是確有恢復的傾向了、又如造船工業、今年三月底止、其建造的噸數比去年一年的建造噸數還多十六萬一千噸、（增加了百分之四十五）這也足以反映英國財界的好轉、貿易的改善、產業界的恢復、</p>
<p>然而這僅祗是就大體的情形而論是如此但在某種主要的產業、如紡織工業還是沒有恢復原狀、不但不易恢復、而且還會被人家侵蝕侵蝕英國紡織工業的、就是以前英國的同盟國日本、在世界戰爭之前、日本紡織品的輸出額年不過四千三百萬日金、在大戰期中就增加到了三萬六千萬日金去年日本棉布的輸出計址一萬萬碼、英國僅祇二十萬萬零四千萬碼竟落到日本之後回想戰前英國輸出棉布祇論印度就有三十萬萬碼、論全世界則有七十萬萬零八千萬碼之多、眞有不勝今昔之感、</p>
<p>所以英國爲自己的利益打算、要鞏固她在亞洲的市塲而事實上又不能和日本打仗、所以這纔有太平洋聯盟的醞釀、當然這須聯合美國、並且以英美爲主體、同時也拉攏與太平洋有關的各國、此舉若成如日本不加入、卽以經濟力共同制日日本加入、則在會議塲中抑制日本、同時也就是第二次華盛頓會議的前奏、英美兩國的利害、雖然很衝突但對於遠東市塲的打算、却有合作對日的可能、現在事實還不曾具體化、不過已由棉業問題發端、英日兩國的利害不同、勢非引起衝突不可了、（四月十二日於倫敦）</p>

<h3>桂省經濟調查印象記（續三月四日）</h3>
<p>— 千家駒</p>
<p>我所　定調查的路綫是這樣的、　南寗－柳州－桂林－平樂－富賀鑲－平樂－梧州－玉林－貴縣－南寗－龍州－南寗－百色、（以上除平樂至梧州、南寗至百色爲水道外、餘均公路、工業組所取的路線、也和我們大致相同、不幸在出發的前一天、工業組領組者吳君半農忽然病了、結果就祇有我們一組先期出發、</p>
<p>九月九日的早農、我們僱了兩輛小車自南寗直達柳州、邕柳公路、計長六百七十五里、我們於上午七時動身、下午三時就抵柳州、交通如此方便這不能不説是受公路之賜了、柳州處桂小之中心、昔本有　省的擬議、後以時局多故而　置、但他仍不失却廣西軍事與經濟的重要地、現在廣西的航空學校·機械廠·酒精廠·墾殖水利試辦區、都附設在此、在地理上柳江上泝紅河以通貴州、下循柳河以至潯、桂平）梧有高屋建瓴之勢、右達桂林平樂、左接慶遠南寗、亦爲用兵必爭之地、我們抵柳州後、下榻於縣政府、縣長李蔭唐先生、招待頗爲客氣、第二天我併尺開開始着手柳州工商業的調查、據商民説柳州的商塲、在民十八九以前、本甚發達但近年以來、則市面蕭條、一落千丈、衰落的主要原因大槪是一則農村破產、購買力薄弱再則因貴州烟土過境者减少、以致影響到一切商業、關於農村破產的具體事實與特貨業（烟土）、在廣西經濟上之特殊地位、我們將在『廣西經濟調查報告』中叙述、茲不具　、這裏僅説一説我們在柳州所得到般的印象</p>
<p>柳州素以木材著稱、故諺有『生在蘇州、長在杭州、吃在廣州、死在柳州、』之説、以柳州棺木、最稱有名故也、但柳州本地、不產木材、木材多來自貴州之古宜古州等處、廣西之融縣苗山等處亦產之、惟皆以柳州爲出口碼頭、故『柳州棺材』之名特　其實柳州的棺材矮小　促、遠沒有江浙一帶所用的堂皇大度、雖有『死在柳州』之名、不見得眞是『得其所哉』的、</p>
<p>在表面上看、柳州的馬路新關、街街整潔、除　梧外、可稱首屈一指、但商塲的敝敗、與農村金融的偏枯、則正與繁華的街道成一反比的對照、拋説當民國初年時、柳州共有五間當舖、現在却連一間也沒有了、典當之所以倒閉、一方面是受紙幣的影響、另一方面不能不説是農村破敗到極度的表徵、我們在柳州、總共住了十一天、各商店·各行·手工業都作了比較詳細的調查、每天所聽到的差不多都是些不景氣的呻吟聲、尤其是農村中、據第四中學的一位敎員告訴我們、農民金融的枯竭、使得農民往往沒有錢買到一頭耕牛、而地主租田給佃戶、首先要打聽他有牛與否、一頭牛可耕地三千斤種、（柳州以斤種百計算田地之單位）收榖三十担、若以人力、則僅能種千餘斤種、收榖十數担、地佃對分、農家僅得五六担、自不足維持生活、所以地主總不肯將田租給沒有耕牛的、柳州荒地之多、這也是原因之一、</p>
<p>柳州的經濟地位、這幾年來可説是如江河之日下、商店倒閉、市面蕭條、尤其是農村金融的　偏枯、可説與全國相一致、年來因都市資金的膨脹與農村經濟的枯竭、國人都大喊其『回到農村』</p>
<p>去的口號、但如何才能使都市資金跑回農村去、這就不是『口號』所能解决的了、廣西當局這幾年來就提倡這農林及水利事業、於農民金融方面、則由廣西銀行試辦農村放欵、設立平民借貸所等等、柳州是廣西試辦各種新興事業的個中心區、所成立的農林機關、計有廣西農　林試騐塲、柳江林墾區和廣西墾殖水利試辦區、農林試騐塲·設在柳州對河大龍潭地方、距柳州約十里、前本稱柳江農林試騐塲、二十一年七月始改稱今名、其主要的工作、就是將各種農作物（如棉花玉蜀黍烟草水稻等）森林（如赤松桉樹）果樹蔬菜作種種的試植和化騐、柳江林墾區置原設於柳城沙塘、二十二年四月始移至柳州對河、昔稱柳慶墾荒局、十八年春併入柳州及慶遠兩造林事務所、改稱　名、林墾區的主要工作、在墾的方面就是發放荒地、調查荒地、和處理墾殖水利試辦區荒山荒地三項、林務方面不外培育苗木、推廣造林、和指導人民造林工作、柳江林墾區所管轄的、不僅是柳城林塲、同時還有柳州、宜山、雒容·林塲、亦歸其統轄、各林塲因成立以來工作努力、業務頗稱發展、據他們向建設廳的報告、各林塲造林面積歷年以來、已達萬一千九百餘畝、計造林株數共五·七二六·六九九株、造林事業在水利極不發達的　廣西、我們認爲是特殊重要的、廣西墾殖水利試辦區爲伍廷颺氏所主持、規模最大、成績卓著、區址設在柳州沙塘、所占面積、計二千一百六十八方里、他們的工作、亦與墾殖區相似、惟偏重於開發水利方面、試辦區於二十一年起兼辦理春種瓷金放欵、貸放給無力購買種子的農民、其目的爲『週轉農村金融』『扶助農村生產』、我現在所要説的就是他們放欵的情形、以作國人注意農村金融問題者之一個參考、</p>
<p>墾殖水利試辦區所占面積、計一城廂·五圩·二十七團、二百三十三村、共計有八千六百多戶、四萬二千六百左右人口、他們的春種資金放欵、係以試辦區内之一部分村落爲試騐性質、二十一年係以沙塘爲中心、計放五十二村、六百一十四戶、二萬八千零五十二元、每戶平均放四十八元、二十二年、係以沙塘·石浦·沙浦·爲中心、計放一百一十二村、一千一百零一戶、四萬一千四百七十八元、平均每戶約放欵三十八元、放欵資金的來源係由該區預領經常費下撥借、二十二年得廣西銀行之補助、透支三萬元以爲貸放之資金放欵的用途、也有規定、（一）購買種子肥料、（二）購買牲畜、（三）購買農具、（四）具他必要的資金、此外如賭錢者不借吃鴉片者不借、酗酒者不借、放欵的利息、定爲月息一分、期限最長一年、擔保物除動產與不動產外、借欵人如信用良好、有附近鄰居若干家爲之保證者、亦得來借、所規定的手續及辦法章程、堪稱完備、辦理的第一年、（二十一年度按期歸還借欵的、計占放出總額百分之九十五以上、這種成績終算難）</p>
<p>能可貴的了、</p>

<h3>感想頗佳</h3>
<p>余在西北觀察所及、綜其感想、甚爲樂觀、較民國二十一年考察團之印象爲佳、因彼時適値西北連年旱災、而昨今兩年、西北雨水霑足、各省均有活潑氣象、寗夏雖有戰事、直接損失不少、以鄉間牲畜爲尤甚、結束幸早、不致妨及春耕、</p>
<h3>官民耐苦</h3>
<p>余所得印象中之尤佳者、西北各省軍民長官、對於地方事務、堅苦從事、以身作則、絶無大官氣派、其精神至堪欽佩、軍士服務於道路水利工事、耐苦耐勞、尤有足多、國人每以東北淪陷、西北亦在危急爲憂、余抵西北後、則深覺樂觀、此種觀念、並不是坐并觀天的樂觀、亦並非輕説西北沒有困難、但認爲西北問題較爲簡單、</p>
<h3>民族平等</h3>
<p>關懷西北者、每以西北民族爲將來絶大問題、引爲隱憂本人以爲不然、在滿淸帝政時代、專用挑撥政策、無端製造種族問題、俾得操縱其間、以統治全國、閲時旣久、遂致積非成是、迨革命成功、五族共和、予全國民衆以同等機會、從前謬見隔閡、一旦化除、西北農民生活簡單、昨今兩年豐收本可休養生息、第有一部份區域、當因派餉制度、民不聊生、此種制度、地方軍政當局、</p>
<p>非不知其害、迫不得已而爲之、若予以相當措置及時間、當可糾正而革除之、</p>
<h3>幣制紊亂</h3>
<p>西北各省幣制紊亂、確爲金融上一大問題、亦生產上之大障礙、好在各省所發紙蹩數額不巨、尙不難整理、對於工商事業、經濟上尤有輔助之需要、希望國内各銀行、能前往投資、多設分行、以發展農村之生產與工商事業、以余觀察、西北政局已臻安定、投資前途、頗覺穩當、</p>
<h3>經會建設</h3>
<p>至於經濟委員會在西北各省所經營者、如水利·道路·衛生·獸醫·救濟農村等、大致已由經委會大會决定、此次視察後、容有稍須更改者、當提出常會討論、各省政府與地方領袖機關、自必能竭力助成、現在國家多艱、經委會爲財力所限、目前從事於西北建設事業者、僅二三百萬元、但余認爲欵額雖少、效果必大政府此次、對於西北建設、抱實做主義、不尙空言、只求民衆得到實惠、西北民衆、深知政府之關懷、恊力合作、以赴此共同目的、則一文之力、或能做成數文之事、是以本人對於西北建設前途、頗抱樂觀也、</p>
<h3>銀公司事</h3>
<p>宋氏旋詳答各記者所詢之種種問題、首稱、建設銀公司之組織、純爲國人資本、絶無外人關係、資本總額定爲一千萬元、不久可望成立、</p>
<p>至成立後、與國外發生企業上之關係、此完全爲營業問題、事前因無任何限制也、本人以旅途勞頓、須稍事休息、尙未與孔財長等會晤、一切均待與各方詳商、拉西曼博士何時能返華、余最近未得電告、無從揣測、</p>
<h3>入川有待</h3>
<p>宋氏又謂、余擬留滬整理視察西北之報告後、卽晋京、向經委會常務委員會報告經過、俾得逐漸實施建設計劃、雖四川之行、俟京中任務終了、再定期啓程、余深願親赴内地各處視察、蓋百聞不如一見、蜀中終當一往也</p>

<h3>菲隊先敗後勝</h3>

<h3>今日中日决賽</h3>
<p>此次足球賽成績中國二戰二勝、日本一勝一敗、菲荷均一勝二敗、明日爲中日比賽、華軍若勝、結果三勝無敗、穩獲錦標、日軍若勝、則中日兩軍均二勝一敗、平分錦標、然明日之戰、華軍頗多攻克日軍希望、故預料可穩得錦標、（編者按已賽成績如下、（一）我國勝菲二比零、（二）荷印勝日七比一、（三）我國勝荷印二比零、（四）</p>

<p>尙餘十分鐘時、菲以三十三比二十佔先、我隊失去可中之球不少、結果菲以三十七比二十七得勝、我隊表演、以王玉增李震中二人爲佳、唐寳堃則令人失望、菲方克羅士及馬底納爲其台柱、比賽因過於劇烈、故舉動越規、入後更甚、競爭劇烈之比賽中、亦勢所必然也、</p>

<p>發生二次錯誤、至第三次菲島選手、仍錯誤起步</p>
<p>、指揮起步者、竟不制止、任其起跑、（四）游泳五百米决賽、遺落豐田選手之第二、日本方面職員嚴重抗議、（五）拳鬥齋藤、茂實本勝、乃判定爲敗等、錯誤續出、參加選手、非常憤慨、致有懷疑菲島是否有主辦國之資格者、</p>

<h3>實行新生活　－首應注重禮貌－</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>現在一般小朋友，大半有一種惡習慣，就是無論對於何人，總沒有什麽禮貌，這實在是不對的。因爲禮貌是很要緊的，如果遇見師長，和父母伯叔，當然應該有禮貌，就是遇見平輩，或者是同學；或者是朋友：也是要有相當的禮貌。</p>
<p>假如你應該有禮貌的時候，你郤忽略了，人家就會説你不知禮貌了。所以一個人無論在什麽時候，什麽地方：總要有禮貌，尤其是在現在全國上下一致提倡新生活的時候。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友們。大家來注意禮貌吧！要知道注意禮貌，是實行新生活的第一個重要條件啊！小朋友們，大家注意吧。</p>
<h3>勇敢</h3>
<p>— 馬嬰</p>
<p>這事已經過去五年了，但是我永遠的記得。</p>
<p>春天的下午，太陽暖洋洋地晒在地上</p>
<p>，天空像一片藍海，只有幾朶薄薄的白雲游着。我換了一件長衫，便走出去，是想去找朋友某君談論一件事；剛走到某君的門口，忽然看見一個七八歲的小姑娘在那裏拍球，我認得伊，伊是住在和某君同屋的金太太的第二個女兒，名字呌做曼。這天伊穿着一件水湖色自由布短衫，　着黑綢短裙，兩條又短又粗的辮子，垂在胸前。伊的手拍着球，那兩條辮子也一搖一擺地。忽然路旁跑來了一個孩子，把伊的球搶去了。伊不禁一呆。我想伊一定要哭了，誰知伊不但沒有哭，反勇敢地追上去，揪着那孩子，兩個人扭做一堆，奪了好一會，那個球終於被曼奪回了。并且那孩子還被伊打哭了，再也不敢過來奪她的球。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們！你看曼是多麽地勇敢呀！現在我們國家的國土給别國搶去了，我們一定要聯合全中國的孩子們，也像曼一樣勇敢地打敗了敵人，把我們的國土再奪回來！</p>
<h3>燕子回來了</h3>
<p>— 常少英</p>
<p>天氣漸漸的暖和了！</p>
<p>久别的燕子，</p>
<p>又重新尋它的舊巢；</p>
<p>燕子呀！</p>
<p>請你告訴我－</p>
<p>你飄過的海，</p>
<p>你走過的道，</p>
<p>你遊歷的地方很多；</p>
<p>你的見聞，</p>
<p>一定不少；</p>
<p>現在和風已吹醒它了！</p>
<p>你看它－</p>
<p>頭上戴着鮮花！</p>
<p>身上披着綠襖！</p>
<p>當春說話的時候，</p>
<p>它也在呢喃地唱着歌調。</p>
<p>可愛的蜜蜂</p>
<p>可愛的蜜蜂！</p>
<p>你的時運眞好！</p>
<p>美麗鮮艷的花蕊兒，</p>
<p>都被你先採；</p>
<p>甜蜜芬芳的花氣兒，</p>
<p>倒被你整個的飽嘗了！</p>
<h3>世界最寒之國的兒童</h3>
<p>— 胡藴五</p>
<p>在北美的極北葛林蘭地方，有一種愛司基摩人，爲全世界最矮小的民族，就是大人，亦不過一米突身高的侏儒。他們在冰原裏，把冰塊切成四方形當做磚瓦用，這種房屋，遷移不定，常賴犬推挽到風雪稍小的地方，所以沒有一定的村落，也沒有一定的街道，因爲他們住在寒帶地方，除遊獵外，不容易尋到别的食物，倘若捕獲了大批的動物，如海豹·鹿·白狐·熊等，就要搬移冰屋，輸送到别處、交換些鍋·刀·自來火等東西。</p>
<p>最奇者是他們的狗，到了晚上，守護在冰屋外面，留心野獸，有否經過，有時給主人到各處去探尋野獸的踪跡，因此愛司基摩人對狗，認爲保護一家生命的守護神，大凡捕獲的動物，也與犬分配同食，他們的兒童，是和狗在一塊兒長大，以狗爲好朋友，狗亦在家中極力守護兒童，假使有熊豹狼等猛獸來襲，狗卽拼命的救護兒童。</p>
<p>雖則自幼生長在冰原上，身體矮小，可是筋肉與皮膚，鍜鍊得十分强健，胸幅開展得廣闊，終年與寒風冰雪相奮鬥，毫不覺到什麽苦痛。兒童們日出而起，這樣看起來，我們溫帶的人，享受自然界物質的恩惠，還要貪心未厭，怕寒怕苦，豈不要愧死嗎？</p>
<h3>動物的舌頭</h3>
<p>— 兪百祿</p>
<p>舌頭在動物的身體中可以説是最奇怪的部分了，它能够很快的推出拉進，很愉快的從左邊移到右邊或者向上向下，再能够極自如的曲捲，伸直。</p>
<p>小朋友，你可曾注意過舌頭的形式。最薄的尖頭向着中點漸漸厚起來，到中點，再向著喉頭傾斜。舌根雖是固定在嘴的底部，但它的尖，它的邊，都可以隨意運動，除了想離開嘴巴跌到外面去。</p>
<p>舌頭對於我們的用處可謂大極了，除了它，談話器官雖然尙有唇牙，顎、臭、喉等，但是它可以説是最主要的了，試問沒有它你能够把話説得淸晳而使人家聽得懂嗎？還有在吃東西的時候，它能够帮助我們辨味，將唾液和食物混合，再將沒有嚼細的東西捲了放在牙齒上咀嚼，而將嚼細的送到喉裏嚥下。</p>
<p>有幾種動物它是用舌頭作爲手的，牛你可以説最容易見到，它吃草的時候是將粗大的舌頭把草捲成球形，然後拉住了頂端而呑到胃裏去，麒麟吃起來和牛差不多，它是用細長的舌頭捲住了多葉的小枝，再用牙齒咀嚼在範團裏的樹葉，蛙的舌頭和普通的動物不同，它的舌根是生在嘴的前部，舌尖郤向着喉頭，當它看到一隻飛蟲近它身體的時候，就將舌頭從裏恨快的抛出而將這蟲黏住作爲食料，因爲它的舌尖上是有着一種膠質。澳洲有一種食蟻獸，它有著一根細長的像螺旋形的舌頭，用這舌頭它常常通到蟻穴裏的吃到很多的螞蟻。啄木鳥的舌頭是很粗糙的，因爲這樣它能够在樹枝裏拖出蛀蟲來。</p>
<p>世界上最大的舌頭要算鯨魚了，活的時候差不多有十四尺長，也就是你們三個人身體相加的長。小朋友，你想可怕不可怕？</p>
<h3>烏賊骨的用處</h3>
<p>— 張鑫發</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們家裏的人，吃了烏賊的肉，總是把它背上的一塊骨毛掉，很是可惜，其實它有很多的用處，我現在有二種寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）拿一二根小棒，挿在骨上，然後再用紙剪成風篷的樣子，黏在小棒上，放在水裏順風而漂，眞好像一隻帆船，或者可憑你聰明的腦子，去做成像隻軍艦的樣子，那更好玩了。</p>
<p>（二）將烏賊骨藏在家裏，一旦用刀不愼，割開了皮膚出血時，卽將它刮下的粉末，放在傷處，很可以止住血的。</p>
<p>還有一層要請注意的，就是千萬不要用烏賊骨的粉粒，當作牙粉用擦牙齒，因爲它的粉粒很粗，雖然你的牙齒擦白了，但你牙上的琺瑯質已被擦得很糙了</p>
<p>兒童科學講座</p>
<h3>風</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>夏天快來了，小朋友們都歡迎着風的來到，但是，風是地裏來的？你拿把紙扇擺動着，（圖一）它立刻很溫軟的吹拂着你的面龐。你拿一個紙捻，放到煤油燈罩的口上去試試看，你會覺得燈罩裏有熱風向上吹來，（圖二）紙捻向上舞動。這就是因爲罩内的空氣受熱而膨脹上升，罩外的冷空氣，就從罩底下衝了進去。熱空氣出去，冷空氣進來塡補它們的空位；空氣這樣的流動，便成了風。好像燒一壼開水，壼底近火的水先熱而上升，上面的冷水就去塡補它的空位，（圖三）一樣道理。太陽射到地球上的先很熱，使大部分的空氣受熱上升，另一部分的空氣就過來補充，這便是風的成因。</p>
<p>風的種類很多，大槪是根據着力量的大小來區分。普通的微風和疾風對於人類植物都有利益的。我們日常的食糧稻麥，還有其他的植物如蒲公英，楊柳，松柏······都是靠着風力替它們傳送花粉，（圖四）才能結實。如果沒有風，海上的多量水蒸氣就不會吹到岸上來，那陸地上就會减少雨量。風又可以代替人力，像行駛帆船，（圖五）藉風力磨粉，（圖六）還可以淸潔空氣，調節氣候，風的工作，是多麽偉大啊！</p>
<p>自然，風也是有害處的。像颶風一起，翻舟塌屋，㧞樹倒墻，（圖七）也有捲海水上陸，釀成大災，（圖八）不過這些現象，究竟是偶然的事哩！</p>
<h3>花間的蜜蜂蘇州景海小學</h3>
<p>— 周榕</p>
<p>時光如水流一般地過去着，春天已去了多日，天氣的寒暖在寒暑表上增降，花蟲也跟了氣候的關係，生長出來。</p>
<p>在某日覺得非常之熱，我坐在一塊很淸幽的靑石上，看那一隻穿着一件美麗的黃衣服的蜜蜂，在空中飛舞，好像找東西一般的在找着，原來他所要找的就是一株玫瑰花。</p>
<p>它找尋了多時，才找到了，於是又驚又喜的連忙伸也了針般的東西，去吸取那玫瑰花中的甜蜜，吸了這朶，再吸那朶；一共吸了無數朶。</p>
<p>我看了之後，感想到這蜜蜂如同日本來侵佔我們東北的三省一樣。爲什麽呢？因爲它的針有如同日本人的武器。他們用了武器來佔據我們的土地；正如蜜蜂用針去吸取蜜糖呢！</p>
<h3>爲甚麽要看報</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>小朋友們：你的爸爸，媽媽，哥哥，姐姐，還有你自己，每天不是都要看報嗎；但是爲甚麽要看報呢？這問題恐怕你一時回答不出，我現在給你説；</p>
<p>從前是沒有報紙的，－你聽見一定覺得很奇怪，那是眞的。－所以在那時候听風氣非常閉塞！只有人在得到功名的時候，才有專差到他的家裏去送報單；收這種報單的人家，還要付出很多的酒資；但是只知道他家裏的人是很到功名了，此外沒有别的意義。</p>
<p>自從有了報紙以後，報紙的事業就一天一天發達起來；因爲只要花費很少的錢，就可以知道世界的大勢，國家的情况，社會的新聞，還有附刋上的文字，可以增添多少興趣。至於我們看報的目的，除過能够得到上述的種種智識外；並且我們可以把報紙做一種日常的功課，看見報紙上登載着好的人物，或好的事情，我們就仿效他；看見登載有不好的人物，或者不好的事情，我們就戒避他；那麽我們每天都有了好的榜樣，和壤的警告，那也就是我們看報的利益了。</p>
<h3>急口令</h3>
<p>— 秦雲先</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們，本報已經有好多首急口令登載過，大槪你們都已看過了，同時，我曉得你們對於它一定狠有興趣的，所以我現在也有二首急口令，，貢獻給你們，雖然我這二首急口令，字數狠少的，但是讀起來却狠難讀，越讀得快，字的音節，越要讀錯。現在讓我寫在下面，諸位小朋友，不妨試試看。</p>
<p>（其一）嫂嫂燒香要燒蕭山香。</p>
<p>（其二）紅花碗裏盒着一只活得綠蛤蚆。</p>
<p>小經騐</p>
<p>— 劍芬</p>
<h3>墨</h3>
<p>小朋友；天氣已經慢慢地熱了起來，手上時常要出手汗了。磨墨的時候，手拿着墨，因爲手上有汗，被墨染着，手上會給墨染黑的；你如果把已染着墨黑的手，不留神的撫着臉上，臉上就會染有墨點；碰在書上，書上就有墨黑的手印。這是多麽討厭的事！怎麽辦呢？我們只要把墨的一頭，－（手拿的一頭）－用紙包裏着。磨墨的時候，把手拿在包好的紙上；這樣：手上就是有汗，但是墨無論怎樣，是不會染到手上去；因爲包墨的紙，已發生功効了。</p>
<h3>硯</h3>
<p>小朋友；假使「硯台的底」是平滑的，「檯面」也是平滑的；那末在磨墨的時候，你不要妄記在「硯台」下面墊一張「軟紙；」這樣磨起墨來，「硯台」就不會轉動了。否則：你在磨墨的時候，「硯台」</p>
<p>就會隨着「磨墨」轉移的。－原因是：「硯台的底」是平滑的，「檯面」也是平滑的；磨墨的時候，因爲「墨」震動「硯台，」「硯台」動了，「硯台的底」就和「檯面」起分離變化，所以「硯台」就要移動；如果兩介之間墊上一張「軟紙，」就發生連絡作用，因此「硯台，」就不會移動了。—</p>
<h3>笨的駝</h3>
<p>— 鳥若虚</p>
<p>住在熱帶沙漠裏的駝鳥，可算是鳥中之王了。它有小馬般的體格，它有强健的腿力，能疾行數十里於一刹那間，幾乎沒有鳥類再比它强大了。但是人們要捉它却比捉一隻麻雀還容易，因爲它很笨，當它看見獵人走近的時候，它並不逃走，只將頭鑽到沙中去，剩下身體，蹲在地面上，它以爲這樣躱藏起來就不至於給人家看見了，那裏知道就這樣入了獵人之手呢！小朋友，愚笨的舉動往往會鑄成大錯，譬如有許多膽怯的小朋友，因爲怕半夜的老鼠或惡夢，常常將被窩沒頭而睡，試想這是多麽不衛生的一件事啊－</p>
<h3>頑皮的王兒</h3>
<p>王兒趁着水泥匠休息，也來帮忙粉刷。</p>
<p>先來玻璃上試試看。</p>
<p>王兒的爸爸在書房裏見了很是驚奇。</p>
<p>喲啊！糟糕了！怎麽粉到臉上來了？</p>

<h3>糧食變化中期粉微漲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初跌後穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回跌七角另、坎拿大跌四五角左右、因此開價時、人心卽是軟弱、各月份又小半分至七厘半不等、迨後因天時陰晴、一般人恐有雨意、並以廠家不多、内地帮頗有收進、市氣又稍轉穩、迨至下午開盤、初見好象、入後則又疲落、傳天津現貨行市、逐步不振、本地所製之通粉、祗售一元九角半、（按質量與上海之二號粉相彷彿）所以客帮心甚寂、上海粉之立脚點、亦不免更陷絶境、故市塲交易、又呈淸淡、廠家之出路、亦少發展也、結果本月份</p>
<p>微好五厘、六月份好五厘、七月份好二厘半、八九十月份均未動、</p>
<h3>期麥大體堅穩</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平穩之象、以洋麥報價、雖芝加哥小七角零、坎拿大小四五角、惟以天時陰晴、氣候恐有變動、故人心又轉穩健、因近日之晴雨、對於新麥年收、大有關係、市面之升沉、故亦不安也、惟市塲交易、不見暢旺、客戶出數亦不甚多、且内地帮或有收進致市氣常爲擯住也、結果七月份較好一分、八月份好三分、九月份好四分現麥市面、仍見平定、廠方祇大廠尙有應酬、小廠因洋麥旺到後、需要甚少、故陳麥去路、遂受打擊也、開碭山麥三元、歸德麥三元瑤灣麥二元九角七分、至九角半、南京麥二元九角六分、宿州麥二元九角半、許三千包、由福新辦去、</p>
<h3>河下米下垂之象</h3>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源四十餘號、厚薄粳約各占半、惟以晚稻較爲稍多、去路客帮包胃又動、如北洋帮進納靑角松泗楓練等貨、先後有二千餘包、故初勢似能略轉、惟結果以剩貨頗夥、致成供過於求市色垂軟數分至近尺、各厚粳以店胃續懈、成交有限、形勢淸寂、市况下垂、如常蘇帮同南港等貨價步跌一二角不等、杜洋尖到俱淡、市色未見若何榮辱、變陰元來貨旣旺、而銷胃轉懈、市形亦修落二三角之譜、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各路來源四十號左右、市上各種銷胃、白粳白元呆滯、羊尖杜尖埠尖略化、客尖問津寥寥、早薄稻去胃平淡、市形白粳白元早薄稻價小一二角、其餘價小一角左右、</p>
<h3>中關客糙回小角半</h3>
<p>昨日客秈、本客去化不及日前之貪、且到頭逐多、一部份囤戶回出前日辦進之客糙、全日糙米只開二千二百五十包、客機秈共開一千八百包、較之日前售開數已减少數倍、更以囤戶回出後、市塲空氣已見轉變、漲風立挫、沙市特别糙仍開至七元二角七分、大市貨已小至七元進關、祗開六元九角及六元七八角、比之前市、較小角半及一角、各檔機秈均帶小數分至角許、惟江西機晚米存到兩乏、閩帮與本街均有問訊、昨日祗開二百包、價仍至八元九角、小絞米身骨較高、昨囤戶回出客秈客糙之後、反將小絞收進、而内地帮與甬紹帮復有吸收、共計上下午開出五千七百包、價仍站住七元八角云、</p>
<h3>油市倐上倐落之白桐油</h3>
<p>白桐油漢口洋莊最大上週售至二十九元六角、後因洋行不能繼續、卽鬆至二十八元、然至貨仍然稀少、據川省產桐區域、淪入匪區、故出運異常艱難、聞有大批阻在中途、屢傳將欲抵漢、然遲至又遲、依然不到、所以洋行採辦之際、極感缺貨、而一經洋莊停辦、又防途湧到、以致　起鶻落、日有所聞、而近日漢市又傳襄桐有大批可到、然亦杳無確期、洋行解貨、則又不能待、因此時感供不敷求、漲風之倐起、職是故也、惟今庚情形、與往年不同、蓋上年年令大歉、各產地收成、祗有對折、產額之减、無可諱言、現雖微感缺貨、尙不至捉襟露肘狀態、恐將來新陳交替時、更有甚於斯者也、浙桐隨同漢市進退、故倐起倐落、幾已司空見慣、前日杭行在申售價每砠由二十五元零跌至二十四元、次日復又漲至二十五元外、一日數市、殊合人堕入五里霧中、實開從來未有之新紀錄、而現市又在二十四元六八角矣、本埠油麻號家、因底積尙厚、内銷並不大旺、所以亦不急進、但後去市面、總是榮多辱少、故有遇而不求者、亦不肯放棄也、</p>
<h3>花生油突跌五六角</h3>
<p>豆油亦在看跌中</p>
<p>昨日采菽堂油市、祇有花生油應市、計開出泊兒一百件價爲十元零二角、夾倉四百件、價十元、市價比星期三最高峰、泊兒須跌六角、夾倉跌五角、原因來源見接、豆油不振、致市氣突變、豆油因連電轉跌、市塲交易停頓、故向依連電爲轉移之人心、一致趨疲矣、</p>
<h3>糖市國產靑糖仍在上漲中</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以關金又鬆、趨勢依然疲弱、公會划盤二四粗砂划二十元七角半、稍有成交、比前日小去五分、太古糖Ｂ嘜連日漲二十一元、未成昨已以零八角半成交、跌去一角半、國產靑糖以行方進意濃厚、仍在上漲中、廣帮號家開出祝靑二百餘包、貨較高價爲十一元三角半、比前昨四角許、潮帮以靑粮看升、觀望未開、僅開出湖莊正綿赤三十五件、十四元、又枝赤數十包、十三元、連帮號家開出高統手氷一批、十六元四角、標凖五福白糖因厦廠尙在開煮、一時乏貨運申、</p>
<h3>絲茶新廠經歐銷續暢</h3>
<p>今歲江浙兩屬改良種蠶汎較優、豐收可望、而蠶絲已成立統制、新繭市價、因以海外絲市爲標凖、不得過昂、故一般絲廠商均放膽抛售新期絲、英法兩莊亦乘機抛購成交續暢、昨由怡昌等進新廠經一百二十包、價仍平定、</p>
<h3>浙屬收繭員出發</h3>
<p>浙屬杭紹湖嘉新繭轉瞬上市、本埠絲繭商預</p>
<p>備前往收繭者、均遵章依限登記、今届蠶汎、以改良種蠶最佳、模範與改良等區成績較優、故收繭人員均已次第出發、蠶欵亦早裝往、其中以往模範與改良區者爲多、是以臨平餘杭長安海寗紹興蕭山臨安吳興平湖嘉興等處繭行、大半租出、今届浙悄繭市、當較去歲爲盛云、</p>
<h3>祁門新紅茶已到滬</h3>
<p>昨源豐潤仁德永等茶棧、已運到祁門新紅茶八百餘箱、聞今明日、尙有大批新貨運到、下星期當可一律佈樣、</p>
<h3>遂安珍眉大跌</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、來路莊之遂安珍眉綠茶、因華商亟於脱手、不惜貶價賤售市價較前日開盤、暴跌二十元、市面頗爲紊亂、土莊溫州等路珍眉、保昌錦隆各洋行、雖均有零星進胃、然售盤亦　之下跌、局勢異常悲觀、惟溫州河口等路紅茶、市面最爲堅硬、但市上來路新貨不多、因此一般土莊廠家、多有乘機趕製紅茶、以供銷售、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢羢囤貨交易紛起</h3>
<p>邇來呢羢現貨市而、明暗均弱、而洋行定價、仍　常堅强、同業中囤貨交易紛起、銀根鬆裕之號、刻皆搜羅現貨、金融短促者則均願削賤以求現、昨四萬二千號花呢、同業囤貨價爲五元、現市大路貨價五元四角、秋冬到價揭算、須五元三</p>

<p>婦女園地（第十四期）</p>
<h3>德國賢妻良母制的復活</h3>
<p>— 碧雲</p>
<p>自黑色專制魔王希特勒爬上德國政治舞臺後，給我們傳來的德國消息、除了流下層民衆的血，追逐猶太人和張牙舞爪地凖備要同别國打仗外，就是異想天開地想種種方法來壓迫婦女。他起初是削奪婦女的選舉權，其次是逼迫婦女離開職業回到家庭，最近且强迫（名爲奬勵）婦女結婚。總而言之，是要完全恢復那中古時代家庭奴隸式的「賢妻良母制」·他的辦法是：命令各工蔽，各學校及各種社會機關辭退婦女；設立什麽「訓練婦女營房」，强迫十七至二十五歲的女子去受五個月的訓練（如照管小孩，縫紉，烹調，哺乳及一切家庭瑣務），和設立什麽「公共結婚所」，奬勵結婚（凡到一定年齡不結婚的，則徵以重税，並設法撤退其職業）－－這些都是希特勒對待德國婦女的「新發明」，也就是法西斯特的治國大政方針之一。</p>
<p>但何以希特勒要這樣壓迫婦女呢？據法西斯特自己宣布：取消婦女選舉權，是因爲婦女的任務只能在家帮助丈夫管理家務，多生小孩和撫養小孩，如果婦女參加政治活動必然要抛棄家務；同樣的理由，婦女不應離家擔任社會職務，並且以爲擔任社會職務，便是佔據了男子的飯碗，增加失業；至於强迫結婚，那更是簡單而明顯，爲的是多多製造「國民」肉彈丸－以便將來好和别國拚命。其實，在我們看來，事情並不這樣簡單。我們如要眞正了解希特勒黨之所以如此倒行逆施的眞實原因，必須求之於牠的本質。牠的組成份子大都是些破產的小布爾喬亞，軍人，學生和流氓。牠的任務，是反對任何民主主義，以便建立資本魔王之赤裸裸的獨裁·我們只看希特勒黨纂奪德國政權後的一切設施就會明白·牠首先就是取消議會制，取消民衆的一切結社，集會，言論，出版和信仰等自由權。使整個兒的德國回復到中古時代的黑暗統治。這樣，德國的婦女嘗然是應該壓迫的對象了。因爲婦女大衆在社會上旣是被剝削和壓迫的一層，所以她們常常要求解放，要求進步，要求民主，因而容易與其他的被壓迫者的解放運動打成一片，合流前進－這便是法西斯特必須壓迫婦女，必須將她們從政治和社會的活動塲所拉回來鎖在家庭裏作奴隸的眞實原因了。</p>
<p>由上面的叙述看來，德國的法西斯特是一切被剝削者被壓迫的死敵；同時也當然是我們婦女大衆的死敵，牠將我們德國婦女界經過多年辛苦鬥爭所獲得的政治權利和職業權利一下剝奪了，將我們婦女又重新從社會捉了回來在賢妻良母的美名之下，强迫充當男子的家庭奴隸，並且　强迫她們爲牠正在凖備着的戰爭加緊製造「肉彈丸」。難道在上次世界大戰中德國婦女所遭受的悲慘命運還不够嗎？上千萬的婦女喪夫棄子，她們的傷痕至今尙未全愈，而吃人血的希特勒黨現在又要凖備動員她們的丈夫和兒子去吃子彈！這是一種何等可怕的前途擺在德國婦女的前面呀！全世界的婦女們應該起來反抗這種開倒車的辦法，我們應該宣布賢妻良母制是鎖住婦女在家庭充當奴隸的一副沈重的枷鎖，一切反動勢力藉以箝制婦女大衆的刑具！我們婦女解放的任務首先就在擊碎這副刑具。我們相信德國的婦女終於會聯合一切被壓迫的民衆，一致起來擊碎這副套在她們頭上的刑具的。</p>
<h3>禱告－爲廬隱的枉死－</h3>
<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>五月十二日晨九點一刻前到了工部局女子中學，走過校長室的門前、見裏面</p>
<p>立的坐的斜倚的十幾位女先生，都拉長了臉；我頓時像着了電，機械地跨進室内。這是除太息聲以外，有人斷斷續續地話説廬隱的生平：説她是一位孤零的慘淡的小孩，是一位中學畢業後卽就食四方并積餘資以進大學的刻苦靑年，是一位和有婦之夫生死相結的舊禮敎下的戰士，是一位爲孤苦的遺雛擎起嚴重的生活十字架的慈母，······她們的聲調是那般凄凉，我彷彿在聽人讀蔡琰的悲憤詩句。</p>
<p>鐘響了，得進課堂。孹頭第一句是學生們問我廬隱的病狀：我用沈默來向她們回答，她們也便低下頭用沉默來領會。忽然校長開了課堂的後門，她向這靜寂的課堂裏放了一串小小的鞭爆，那便是她説的：「黃廬隱先生病危了，諸位！最好給她禱告。」這小鞭爆似的話聲，不由我雖不是敎徒，也呆瞪瞪地走到窗前，心底不流出一句「願斯人長壽！」</p>
<p>的　告。</p>
<p>第二天星期日，紅艷的太陽從東邊的海面出來，正渡入蔚藍的靑空的當中；而在文壇有過聲譽的廬隱，却已帶了精神的肉體的苦閉目而去。</p>
<p>「死」是何時何地何人也不能免的，所差的是她未能遭逢平正與公允。在這文化中心的地方，靑天白日之下，會有人因平常生產小事，遭庸醫的毒剪，剪傷子宫而喪了她的身軀！她的身軀，是她雖遭受了許多風霜凌辱，還爲了孤雛的緣故，不忍遽然抛撇的東西。這是怎樣一塊沙漠地方？這般混亂，這般無秩序，這般荒凉，這般無制裁，這般令人生有沉痛，死有沉哀！</p>
<p>廬隱在臨去的一瞬間，一手牽着一個小孩，她表現了天下的母親對孩子們的眷戀。可憐這兒竟沒有一角孩子們的樂園！隨處有飛機，有流彈，有家狼，有洋犬，有餓鬼，有癘神，有酷吏，有庸醫，有一切軌外的噬人的東西。母親們對孩子撤手也罷，不撤手也罷，她們的</p>
<p>焦憂永不能有一刻兒休息。廬隱的靈魂此刻不知飄忽在甚麽地方，但所可知道的是那焦憂的頑石，一定重重地壓在她的心上。</p>
<p>誰能耐一切的愛慕，一切的計劃，一切的理想，俱犧牲於無謂的俄頃之間？而况眼睜睜瞧着自家傷口裏流下的鮮血，又聲聲聽到親兒愛友的在荒野，在籬邊，在街心，在獄前，不住的呻吟？</p>
<p>啊！在乾枯的沙漠未變成滋潤的水田以前，我願有這麽一句禱告：「願枉死的靈魂立卽消散！」</p>
<h3>世界大思想家對於婦女問題的意見（七）</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>六傅立葉（續）</p>
<p>關於傅氏主張婦女應當解放的意見，我們上次業已簡略地講過了，現在來</p>
<p>叙述他理想中的男女平權的社會。</p>
<p>傅氏認爲在現社會制度之下，最不經濟，亦卽最束縛女性智力發達和掩沒女性才能的，要算管理家務和照料子女兩事。因此，他主張兒童公育，家務社會化，並努力求其實現。他以爲家務果能社會化</p>
<p>，兒童果能公育，則全社會可以節省好多力量，獲益數十倍。他説，城市裏</p>
<p>四分之三的婦女，鄉村裏一半的婦女，是過着寄生的生活，白白地耗費她們的精力於個人生計和家庭</p>
<p>生活中；城市裏四分之三的兒童和鄉村裏一半的兒童，都是生利很微的；四分之三的家事服務員和一半的婢僕，都是如斯。因此，婦女的每日工作估價，要比男性的每天工作估價低五倍。惟有工業，手工業，農民，以及家務等勞動的合作組織，方能消滅婦女精力的無意識的耗費和其奴隸生活云云。</p>
<p>但是傅氏所幻想的合作的集團制度，並非共產主義的。他主張仍舊保持私有財產，繼承權，以及徵取利息等，不過他所設想的勞動組織和集團生活，業已大大地限制了私有財產的勢力。傅氏把他幻想的合作組織呌做「菲蘭」</p>
<p>（Ｐｈａｌａｎｘ），每「菲蘭」包容男婦及兒童一千八百到兩</p>
<p>千名。他關於婦女在菲蘭中的工作説道：</p>
<p>「第一個原則是，每個菲蘭内的工作，須有嚴密計劃，一切工作，不論男性，或女性和兒童，均可同等獲取之；</p>
<p>第二個原則是，一半的生利職業須給予婦女。在今日，最不利的工作是放在婦女的肩上，彷彿女子天生而只是爲烹飯和補綴爛褲子似的，此種現象將來應避免其重演。婦女在菲蘭中，將要承担天賦使命－卽是跟男性立於競爭的地位，而不是服從男性的。</p>
<p>傅氏在别一個地方又説道：「在文藝上，女性將獲得」種光榮，因爲組織完善的社會將依據女子的眞正天性而訓練他們，此種天性，被無意識地耗費婦女精力於個人生計的社會制度所淹沒了。」</p>
<p>有些「哲學家」以爲女子無才便是德，傅立葉則猛烈地攻擊此種見解。據他的意見，此種論斷是毫無根據的。他説：「將來家事合作化，卽可使事務異常简單，僅有現在所耗費的八分之一的婦女精力，便能應付裕如了。」所以，他認爲將來是再沒有用奴隸敎育去屈辱女性之必要了。</p>
<p>又據傅氏的意見，由卓越的婦女可以憶測女性的</p>
<p>使命。此等卓越的婦女的人格，便是女性在才能上可與男性競爭的保證。不過婦女的天才，惟有在可以自由發展的時候，方能充分的表現出來。據傅氏的意見，這，只有在合作組織－「菲蘭」裏，只有在婦女受有適當的敎育後，才能作到。此種敎育的基礎便是勞動，生產的勞動，兒童從幼時起卽應當受此種生產勞動的訓練。</p>
<p>總而言之，在傅立葉看來，政治制度不足輕重；</p>
<p>惟經濟與社曾制度最關重要。所以，婦女在政治上的權利，在他改造社會的計劃上，未予以注意。不過在他所設想的合作組織－「菲蘭」中，不論在勞動上，在敎育上，或在管理上，婦女都是跟男性平等的。雖然，傅氏幻想的大同社會的計劃不是建築在牢固的經濟基礎上面，然他對資本主義社會的光輝的批評，則有不可磨滅的價値。</p>

<h3>公餘拾零　－關於龔尹霞自殺的面面觀－</h3>
<p>— 諒</p>
<p>下午三點半鐘已過，將近六小時埋頭書本的工作確使人感到疲乏了。靜寂的辦公室裏漸漸的起了一陣騷擾，有離了坐位走的，有靠在椅背上欠着身的，有翻閲着各種日報和雜誌的。話機也開始在他們中間撥動了。</p>
<p>主張賢母良妻的Ｂ，一邊看着報紙，一邊獨自的念着：「這的確偉大！看她從容不迫的赴死，是沒有毅力的人所能的嗎？把這種犧牲精神擴而充之，不是義士烈士的行嗎？中國糟到現在這般田地，都由人民的貪生畏死。好個不怕死的偉大精神！」言下有不勝感嘆的樣子。</p>
<p>隔座的Ｙ聽到他的言論，臉孔紅紅地含着怒意的説：「什麽偉大！什麽犧牲精神！這簡直是罪惡，萬難饒恕的罪惡！自己沒有奮鬥的精神，畏懼着生而自殺，已是説不過去，何况再拉了三個無知無辜的子女同死，在法律上講，她的罪惡不可恕赦的。」</p>
<p>「」　「」旁聽着的Ｃ，覺得不能再忍而沉默了·「她確無自殺的理由；愛情，經濟，舊禮敎等都不是使她自殺。就她的遺書看，無論她受的是舊的，或新的敎育，至少已有了很好的工具。像她的地位，不難奮鬥着做個有用的人。這種自殺，簡實是無謂，誘同子女俱死，更屬愚蠢！」她這樣的説。</p>
<p>「我敢説，她殺死她的子女，這是多麽的不人道！」Ｙ又惡狠狠的説·</p>
<p>「哼！不人道！不是合乎鬼道嗎？</p>
<p>「Ｂ説，「龔女士是有鬼説」的信徒，我相信。她以爲這樣死了，夫婦子女仍在一處，這不是合於鬼道而何？Ｄ！你看怎樣？」</p>
<p>「在這樣激烈的爭論中，正覺得沒有插嘴可能Ｄ的，被他這一問，就胸有成竹的滔滔地述説他的意見了：「我以爲各人有處理自己生命之權，所以自殺－是處理生命的一種方法，無論何種自殺，他人不當有所批評的；但鼓動别人自殺，是絶對不應當的，父母有保護子女之權，却沒有殺之之權，這種越俎代謀，實在是侵奪他人的自由。」</p>
<p>餘怒未消的説：「要是這位襲女士能救活的話－！</p>
<p>「當然她還要自殺，」Ｂ不待他的畢　，就搶着的説。</p>
<p>「不准她自殺，一定不准，」Ｙ加了勁説，「非治她的罪不可。」</p>
<p>一時議論紛紛，祇聽見這兒也談着襲女士，那兒也談着自殺，這問題已成爲談話的中心了。</p>
<p>無論龔女士自殺的原因怎樣，她總是一個懦弱的人。在我，因爲自己也是一個弱者，往往易於與弱者表同情。她己自殺了，而且很慘痛的自殺了，我似乎不忍再加非難和責備。我雖不敢頌揚自殺，但很希望牠能發生一點消極的功效，因爲這問題而引起社會的注意，社會的公論，一方，和龔女士處同樣地位的人，也許可從大衆對這問題的意見中，得到一個較爲正確的觀念，而不致蹈她的覆轍。另一方面，在研究她自殺的原因時，人們的心中會激起一個小小的波瀾，這波瀾，也許會對致她自殺的主要原因－吃人的舊禮敎－下一個有力的攻擊，至少，對牠發生一種厭惡和憎恨·這是弱者的我的一點希望。</p>
<h3>家庭内簡單消毒法</h3>
<p>— 獨步</p>
<p>傳染病菌容易滋長的夏季，就將來臨了，對於家庭中消毒的方法，很有凖備的必要，但是有許多不容易舉辦的手續，還是難以普遍，茲將輕而易舉的幾種簡單消毒法，錄之以供參考。</p>
<p>衣類</p>
<p>衣類最完全消毒法，是蒸氣消毒·在家庭中求完全消毒，雖然可以用煮沸消毒；但在高價的綢類，須用「富而馬利」</p>
<p>蒸氣或百分之三的石炭酸水等消毒·至於褲襪之類，可先浸於百分之一的石炭酸水，或「苦來沙兒」水，「來沙兒」水之中，約二小時，取出洗凈，或用肥皂水煮之亦可·不過衣服材料，多係深色品，須注意於褪色之防止，其他最簡便的方法，可用日光消毒，如能返復行之，功效很大。</p>
<p>食器</p>
<p>飲食器消毒，可在淸水或曹達水中煮沸之，約經十五分鐘，卽可取出，至於病人使用的食器，務須食後卽行煮過，再嚗於日光下，方可完全消毒·如碗筷之類，可浸於百分之一的「富而馬利」液中，約一小時後，用水洗凈，得免傳染病菌之寄附。</p>
<p>手</p>
<p>手的消毒，很容易被忽略過去：其實是很重要的一件事情·可用百分之二的「苦來沙兒」液·或「苦來沙兒」肥皂水，酒精等擦試之，可以消毒，</p>
<p>食物</p>
<p>蔬菜果實之類，常有寄生蟲的卵，及病原菌，驅蟲藥等黏附着·務須仔細洗凈·因其大都附着於蔬菜果實之外部、唯一的方法，就是用水冲洗·至於鳥獸魚肉，大槪係熟食，可保無虞·如有生吃之魚蝦等，務必擇其新鮮而潔凈的，用酒或醋等蘸着吃，亦可以算一種簡易消毒法</p>
<p>住宅</p>
<p>在未遷入之前，除了很仔細的掃除之外，更有消毒之必要·住宅消毒法，可</p>
<p>視其地位材料而分别施行·凡板壁玻璃窗之類，可用百分之二的石炭酸液，或百分之一的「苦來座兒」水冲洗·如泥牆紙窗之類，須用柔軟布片擦拭之·倘然可以密閉的房屋，能用「富而馬利」消毒後，再充分引日光入室曝晒，最爲消毒完全·泥地石板等，可用百分之二的石炭酸水·他如厠所陰溝等處，可用百分之三十的石灰乳消毒之。</p>

<p>於是在懂得一點醫道的朋友面前，我是很誠懇很注意地訪問着如何使孩子轉弱爲强，如何使孩子脱除病苦的簡要方法了。不約而同的别人給我的答復是管養治療説得具體一些鷄汁牛汁，鷄蛋，牛奶等等，應該常常服用。此外爲了補救腺病質孩子的先天和後天的缺陷，服用魚肝油是最好方法，而肝油的牌子應當是解伯勒的。此外便或者注封補血針，據説也是辦法，</p>

<h3>改革選舉之初步</h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>中國過去選舉之最大缺憾，與歐美逈異：歐美政黨爲要實行其政策而操縱選舉，中國則不然，選舉是替土豪劣绅另闢一條升官捷徑。歐美民主政治的不能實現是社會制度本身的缺憾，非關選舉制度之不良，其政黨雖常爲資產階級的工具，但所以獲選，固尙以政策相標榜，博人民之信仰；至於中國，就過去所舉行的選舉觀之，則競選者的目的，决不是爲了擁護某一部分人的利益，更談不上政治主張，他們無非是想假手選舉，代替鑽營權勢，藉以升官發財而已。此等人競選之居心，旣不堪問，他們除了選舉舞弊外，當然沒有當選的可能。所以欲求中國民治之實現，除社會社會制度宜根要本改造外，首先還須澄淸選舉制度。選舉制度腐化之根本原因爲一般民衆對政治之冷淡，更不知選舉爲何物，所以此種弊病地方選舉較中央選舉尤爲顯著。而地方自治爲民治的基礎，因此我們進行的初步，遂亦不得不先以改革地方的選舉入手了。</p>
<p>我們對於改革選舉制度之原則和步驟的意見，共有四點：</p>
<p>（一）選舉應使人民週知讀者見我提出這一點，一定很奇怪，難道我們過去的選舉，是不讓人民知道的麽？殊不知過去政府舉辦選舉，雖不是秘密舉行，但實際上人民知有選舉者確屬少數。這固然是我國民智低下所致，但如欲選舉眞正辦好，辦理選舉者無疑的應不憚煩勞地負起這種責任，事前應當利用各種方法，或開市民大會，或印就小册子分發選民，作種種選舉的宣傳。這種宣傳的目的，主要的有三點：（一）使人民週知選舉之舉行：</p>
<p>（二）使人民了解選舉之意義；</p>
<p>（三）摘出市政上應注意之重大問題，誘致人民之政治興趣，因而着重選舉，注意人選。</p>
<p>（二）公開競選我國競選者表面上裝得異常淸高，暗地裏却鬼鬼祟祟，用賄賂，收買，種種不法行爲以求當選。其原因前已言之，卽這班人競選的目的太不純正，如使他人知其競選，必爲人民吐棄無疑。但是我們知道，如果競選者之目的，是爲了實現其所懷抱之政治主張，那我們對於這種人的競選運動，不但不可鄙視，更應極力鼓勵。如此，有政治主張者旣可發展其抱負，選民亦有取捨之標凖，應當倣效歐美慣例，採取「選民提出候選人」制度，並積極鼓勵「候選人做公開宣傳」。</p>
<p>（三）鄉鎭選舉尤應注意我國人對於政治興趣雖極淡薄，然鄉土觀念却極重。所以我們對於鄉鎭等小範圍選舉應特别注重，在這種選舉中，選舉也容易曾得好，因爲這種選舉人數旣少，當選者又必爲選民所熟悉之人物。而且鄉鎭　治與人民之關係旣極密切，選民對於人選也自無隨便投票之理了。</p>
<p>（四）選舉凖備時間宜長這一點目的很簡單，並百是使選民對於選舉及人選之認識，　充分之考慮機會而己。</p>
<p>總之，欲鼓舞人民之選舉興趣，一定要使人民知道自治及市政之良窳與個人關係之重大。若市政主張之得失，能成爲選民選舉之標凖，候選人成敗之關鍵，則選舉舞弊事件旣不會發生，而市政之蒸蒸日上也可預卜。上列諸端不過就改革中國選舉積弊之犖犖大者言之，至於其他選舉技術上之諸問題，如選民登記，投票手續，長短　制等，則在歐美旣有成軌可循，吾人自可因地制宜，截長補短；在此時記者尙無多説之必要也。</p>
<p>生活</p>
<h3>當店官</h3>
<p>— 朋需</p>
<p>咱小子是安徽人氏，祇因受了窮的壓迫，在十二三歲的兒童時節，就從破落的農村裏，跑到這大都市大上海來，更承一個親戚十二分的面情，舉薦了一個○飯的職業呌典當的，這實大是咱小子的運氣！</p>
<p>本來，「徽州朝奉」是出名的一項有面子（？）的職業，所以咱小子一進典當門，也就連帶着有些面子了。走到外面來，人家總呌一聲「當店官」。</p>
<p>記得在進店的時候，一個親戚領着咱向幾位先生行了大禮，又和師兄們作了揖，經過執事先生的承認，便算是「此中人」了。掃地，抺桌，掃貓屎，拌貓飯，添飯······等等，都是固定的事兒，每日都依着時候而做，此外便是找包搬包了。三四個學徒一層層的指揮下來，不消説是「學生頭」最便宜，凡事都指揮下級師弟做，自己却照樣領薪俸。所以，凡是學徒，都希望有這一日。可是在咱升到這層的時候，却另有一個希望生出來。</p>
<p>説起典當，階級的思想是很重的。最高峯是老大先生；帳房，錢房，管包，這是内缺；連同外缺的櫃台先生們便算是上級的要人了。寫當票，捲包，吊牌是中缺。再下一級呢？不敢，便是咱小子目前領導着的學生子了。</p>
<p>咱在上面所説的希望，便是想做捲包。捲包這個缺份是很淸閒的。偷懶些的，從上午開眼到下午三時，完全沒有事兒，睡覺，遊玩，寫字，看書，隨你的便。三點鐘以後，你祇須把本日當下來的衣物，用最妥當的包法，把牠包藏起來，打了烊，便又可以隨你的便了。可是，話雖這樣説，而自己親眼看見的幾個捲包先生，大都是愁眉不展地喊着吃力，因爲每天所經手的衣物，幾乎有幾千斤之多，兩手的力，全聚集在這三四個小時裏發揮，對於身體是非常有害的。咱現在想：祇要上午不貪懶，把上午當下的衣物，先包去了一半，下午多休息一回，那麽，已經分成兩次，身體方面便不致受損了。而且當捲包的，空閒的時間比較的要多些，拿來讀書，寫稿豈不好嗎？薪俸不消説是加一級。可是那裏有這樣好的升缺機會呢？</p>
<p>咱自知是直性的人，肚子裏老是受不了委屈，所以櫃台的缺份是不希望做的。因爲一個櫃台先生要受制於管包先生，假使一件衣服當得貴了，便要咕嚕咕嚕的聽敎訓，有時還要賠貼，利錢算錯了一個銅子也要賠也來。對於當戶方面呢？進門口的，大都已經面有不豫之色，聽見當不起或嫌利息重了，一言不合，便會借此出氣的和你大鬧一塲，弄得烏烟瘴氣的還會引出許多閒人來指摘。若是回口呢？事兒便越弄越大；若是不回口呢？任你是大氣的人也會悶上幾日不快樂，或者還會被經理先生申責一頓。所以咱就希望一輩子不升上去，但是有時因了經濟的壓力，也就不得已地想來一個了。</p>
<p>若是有人－－同業中的人－－想在服務的時間中求一點學問而沒有急切的金錢壓迫的，最好是做捲包。雖然晚上無故不得出外，烟酒嫖賭一槪不得近身，但是保全了身子，終還是合算的。</p>
<h3>放米</h3>
<p>— 惠振家</p>
<p>朋友，這放米二字，你可不要把牠同所謂放粥</p>
<p>放賑一樣的看待，雖在表面上同是含有救濟的意思，但有許多不同的地方，最大的是放米可有加三分利錢的收得（每月百元有三十元和利息），而放粥放賑呢？是一放就連本錢都沒有收回的（這對於施放的人們自有牠間接的作用）。</p>
<p>放米的目的，旣在獲利，則其手段的毒辣，在這剝削的社會上，並不居次要的地位：白米每石八元或七元半（照目前米價）。拿米（與舉債同）的人每拿一石（有拿一斗的）半月卽須還洋九元或八元半，如到半個月不能還時必須「加利」一元，在下半月還時仍如前數。這所謂「加利」似乎是一種「罰金」，實際上一班拿米的飢餓朋友，對這「加利」是無法幸名的。何以故？收入沒有把握，就是牠唯一解釋。他們所拿的米，還有「扣合頭」之説（卽少把米的意思），實際上每石要扣去一二升哩！你道這放米的人，還有絲毫救濟的氣味嗎？</p>
<p>「窮人吃得住苦」，這句話倒是千眞萬確，拿到米吃，暫保生命，像是一種恩惠，但究竟敵不過剝削的慘酷呀！</p>
<p>因此我又在恐怖着目前所謂恩惠的「合作」和「親善」，將會走向怎樣不利的前途呢？</p>
<h3>歌舞班</h3>
<p>— 靜聞</p>
<p>講到歌舞，我們很容易在腦海裏浮現出一羣半裸的少女在舞台上活潑的跳躍的姿態。在這大家都想逃避現實，而姿情於肉的享樂的今日，女性美的鑒賞，無疑的已成爲那些中上層的紈袴少年，恣情者，頽廢者的最大的興趣。歌舞班的興起是有牠的這種社會根原的。</p>
<p>最早的歌舞，是以兒童歌劇的形式而出現的。八九年前，小學裏爲了遊藝會的節目，不得不訓練牠的學生去表演什麽「麻雀和小孩」「三蝴蝶」「葡萄仙子」「月明之夜」一類的歌舞劇；漸漸這成爲一種風氣，於是一些養成師資的幼稚師範，女子師範，就都注意來養成一些歌舞敎員以應需要。一羣　齡的女孩子，大　　作蝴蝶我作貓地在台上跳着無着，已很有趣；若是她們更進一步表演「毛毛雨」之類的愛情劇，其能哄動觀衆，乃是不言可知的了。</p>
<p>歌舞的主持者看淸了這一點，認爲這是一個賺錢的好機會，於是歌舞班就應運而生。歌舞的職業化是始終與這種「色情」部份分不開的。</p>
<p>明白了這種歌舞的發展過程，現在我可進而談到目前歌舞班的組織内容和舞女們樂師們的生活了。組織上歌舞班常是有一個領導人物或是「班主」：若是兩個人共同經營，則無疑地是有兩個「老板」的。一個歌舞班的舞女不可少過七個人，否則弄出來的玩意决不能「呌座」，就是有十五六個舞女也不能算多。音樂師至少亦需三四個人，比如，彈鋼琴的，拉Ｖｉｏｌｉｎ的，打鼓的，拉二胡的　都不可缺少。這還是因陋就簡的。最大的歌舞班，職演員普通大槪都有三四十個人，　　舞女的薪給是以各人的美貎和舞藝爲標凖。普通計薪有兩種方法，一是按月計算，一是按日計算，而按日計算的比較地多。一個舞女，她每月的薪資能到五六十元，是很不錯的。最多可到八九十元（最近已少有這樣的高價），普通不過二十元左右而已。按日計算的，兩塊錢一天是很好的，三塊錢一天的很少，一塊錢一天的則很普通。决不會每天都有「生意」，所以老板是樂得用這種按日計薪的方法，以减少自己的開支，而增加自己的利潤。</p>
<p>音樂師的薪給，因他的技藝的高下，也是大有差别的。不過這些都和舞女們差不多，這裏也不須贅述了。</p>
<p>關於節目，我想分四方面來説。首先，我要説到的是「舞」。須要多數人上台的則有代表本班子的「社舞」（開塲用的）和「水手舞」「狂歡舞」等。須要人少或僅需一個人的，則有「雙人舞」「却爾斯登」「單人舞」「古裝舞」等。最謔浪的，也是歌舞班用以吸引觀客的，則有袒胸露臍的「草裙艷舞」。其次，我要説到「歌舞」。這是歌舞班的生命綫，最好的「玩意」大槪是集中在這一部分。「桃花江」「舞伴之歌」「小开</p>
<p>畫家」「新婚之夜」「夢裏情人」</p>
<p>「三蝶蝶」「好朋友來了」「可憐的「秋香」「毛毛雨」「妹妹我愛你」</p>
<p>「······」等，是這些好玩意的中心，而最能使觀客激賞的。不過現在職業化的歌舞班的女孩子，多半都已過了及笄之年，她們的年齡已不適宜於表演「三蝴蝶」「好朋友來了」，雖然這兩個節目還是演得不少的。又如「小小畫家」，果然相當有趣，但由十六七歲的大姑娘扮頑皮的小孩子，終究覺得有點不相稱的吧。</p>
<p>其次，我必須提到「淸唱」</p>
<p>。這一定是有一個歌喉婉　的女郎，能　她的美妙的聲音，去博得觀衆的喝彩。再説，在後台，舞女們時常有些更换舞衣或化裝上的麻煩，實際上也須有一個人在前台把擾攘的觀衆鎭壓住，一個盛裝的淸唱女郎在這塲合就有需要了。淸唱</p>
<p>的節目，像「可憐的秋香」「昭君怨」人面桃花」「寒衣曲」「春宵曲」「夜花園裏」「一身都是愛「夜來香」等都是很普通的，很能呌座的。</p>
<p>最後，我要説到話劇。我説過，歌舞的興起與其内容的色情化有不可分的關聯。較高級的觀衆根本上或許就不會被這種歌舞吸引去。而較低級的觀衆，他們已經領略過了，對於歌舞，沒有永恒的興趣。歌舞内容的貧乏，使得牠向沒落的途上走，這時，牠就向話劇伸手求援了。班主們常是這樣的利用話劇來恢復他們可能希望得到的觀衆。不過他們的所謂話劇，實際上是文明戲，常常是沒有脚本，沒有台詞而靠演員的天才草率登台的，内容　表演些不關　　的國家　　和一些太太小姐公子哥兒所喜歡的東西。</p>
<p>各個歌舞班的人才是很不同的。有的能自編舞曲，自創舞姿；有的嫌自己人才不够，出數百元的重金，請外國專家敎授各種舞藝。有的則能虚心的與文藝界，音樂界，電影界的名人聯絡，求他們的指導。甚至與拳術界也曾有過一度的握手，因爲技擊一類的事，也可以挿在歌舞中算作一個節目的。雖然這些都表示歌舞的目　　大能單獨支持的情境，　這並不一定就是表示歌舞已到了末路。不單是在「肉感」的一</p>
<p>點仍可相當號召觀衆，而且在目前他們還有一個好出路，就是「到南洋去」。在國内各埠表演，像漢口平津等地，也許他們連回上海的路費都給賠了，而須要典質而歸（這樣的事已有過好幾次）；但是到南洋去就不同了，那裏有很多富有的僑胞，他們愛祖國，也喜歡祖國的玩意，到那裏去是穩賺錢的。ＸＸ歌舞團班主不是從那裏腰纒萬貫的回來了嗎？每個舞女，音樂歸，不都是至少每</p>

<h3>意農業復興政策的成效</h3>
<p>— 壯游</p>
<p>一戰後意大利的農業衰落</p>
<p>歐戰結束，意大利一躍而成世界五强之一，霸視南歐。這背約同盟的結果，雖然遂了當局者勃勃野心的願望，但戰後的意國經濟，却陷於破產的境地。本來，意國實業，以農業居首位。全國農民佔人口總數百分之五十五；而國庫歲收總數八五億至一百億利拉（意幣名）中，農業所得税約佔三十至三二億利拉之多，由此可知農業在意大利的經濟制度上所居地位之重要了。但歐戰後，政治的混亂，社會的無秩序，使人民不能安居，多抛棄田田園，趨集都市，致農業受莫大打擊，造成生產率的鋭减，與入超額的突增。從一九一三年至一九一九年，國外食品輸入由七萬萬利拉猛增至五二萬萬利</p>
<p>拉。穀類，肉類等物，輸入大見增加，而麵粉，水菓等主要輸出品，則全現停頓，同時工業原料，亦全仰給於外國輸入，當時意大利之農業衰落，遂陷全國經濟制度於極端不穩狀態中。</p>
<p>二墨索利尼之復興農業運動</p>
<p>及至一九二二年，法西斯黨執政，怪傑墨索利尼登台，獨裁全意，見到國内經濟的危機，而同時他的蕃衍人口的政策成功（意現有居民總數爲四二、五五四、○○○人，較一九二一年數目增加三、七九九、○○○人，又每年生產率超過死亡率的五十萬之譜），人口繁殖甚衆。認爲欲解决此二項問題，實非重興國内最重要的農業不可，便立卽草成農業復興的計畫，付諸施行。該事主腦者梭丕累嘗言曰，吾國苟欲於此地窄人稠，自然財源缺少的環境中，謀發展國家實力，伸張國家文化者，必須創造農村生活的新中心，以增加歲收。而同時應保護與整理農村生活的安全與多產，以抗城市的破壞力也。」由此可知農業復興與意大利的經濟和治亂關係的重大。而此事遂成爲法西斯蒂政府之所急於實現之政策了。</p>
<p>三墾拓後荒蕪之地悉成膏腴</p>
<p>墾闢荒蕪貧瘠之地，爲意農業復興運動中最重要的計畫。因爲意大利國内大部分是山地，皆荒瘠不能種植，若一旦拓發之，則耕種地域方能擴大，生產量自可增進。此事並非新創，歷任政府亦嘗擬成種種計畫，但皆礙於經費，未能成功。現政府對於此事實施的經費，預算爲三十餘萬萬利拉。現在初步的工作已經成功，意大利所有荒蕪程度較輕的地面，已皆墾種無遺。至於那些貧瘠地上，亦皆設法用加肥與灌漑的方法，使其適於耕植。而其餘未開闢的區域，待各項工程設備完整後，亦可下犁耕種。總計在此法西斯黨執政十年中，意大利良田之增加達八、五○○、○○○畝。由此數目，可窺其成績之一斑。</p>
<p>至於水沼區域，與積水濕地的拓殖，亦爲重要計畫之一。意大利因人口增殖的壓迫，森林樹木被伐殆盡，結果，多山地域，山洪暴發，時患水災，而肥沃平原，每多爲水淹沒，變爲沼澤。此次開發計畫，包括面積十六萬七千畝，其中一部分全爲水淀，爲毒蚊繁殖之大本營，常傳播瘟疫於鄰近村鎭上的居民。至於那些高出水面，深人山中之沼池，多因瘴氣瀰漫，致不能開墾。</p>
<p>從前敎皇們亦嘗投資開墾這些地域，但是因爲那些沼澤的平面常是高低不一，而且又缺乏抽水站，所以常常通盤費用全落於空，一無所成。然而這些問題却給現在復興運動中的工程師們很敏捷，而有效能的解决了，他們掘造了許多容量和斜度適當的排水溝渠：而且在必要的地方，建立着許多的抽水站，它們都是用電機馬達來管理的，如此便可以阻止大水的汎濫。</p>
<p>在二年前，開發這些濕地的工作就開始了，現在已大半完成。昔時那些傳佈瘟疫的，不整的水沼，現在大都變成廣可六十畝至百畝的堅固的農屋，或其他的建築物了！人民只要付一筆相當的地價錢，便可據爲已有。那些農屋，儘够一個大家庭的應用，且附設着猪、牛、馬、與家禽的廐舍。至於農產品之出產，亦有巨量的增進，大麥，小麥，燕</p>
<p>麥，玉蜀黍，和其他糓類與各種水菓菜蔬，到處的生產着。在未墾拓前，這些地帶居民總計不過千九百人，現在己有五萬人和他們的家庭，希望能够永久的居住於這平安的環境中。政府又在適當的地點，建立着許多市鎭，各鎭中皆有一敎堂，一醫院，一學校，當然，在許多店舖和旅館之外，還有一個電影院。</p>
<p>又從事這項工作的人員，共有一萬三千人，在這工業裁員潮中，這亦可算是一點失業的小的補救哩！</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>人也有三五百元的剩餘嗎？所以「到南洋去」成了目前歌舞界的一個口號。我知道目　正有兩個歌舞團體在作着這種凖備呢。</p>
<p>現在我要説一點舞女樂師們的私人生活。舞女們的出身顯然是下層的或沒落的中層人物。她們爲了自己和家庭的生活，不得不以「大腿酥胸」去換取麵包。封建觀念的衣大半是從她們的身上脱去了，而那種環境又要求她們放浪一點，所以她們每一個幾乎都是很開通，很解放的。他們已捨棄了小家碧玉的扭扭揑揑，你一聽見她們關於愛情方面的談吐，你也許會覺得你是很落後的了。　　因爲這種不　，她們常會被　去貞操。一個舞女成爲老板娘或班主的太太是豪不　奇的。一個舞女和一個音樂師「結合」了，而他不和她結婚，甚至丢了她，也很普通的。有時，有些大老要人公子少爺們欺侮了她們，她們也只好把眼涙　到肚裏去。她們多數實在都是些爲生活而掙扎的可憐的女兒呵！</p>
<p>音樂師的生活也是一樣的悲苦。他們的環境容易使他們作粉紅色的夢，但他們的收入，常常是要打斷他們的興頭的。我曾見過他們一些神經質的沉　的面孔。有一個音樂師九年不曾回過故鄉，爲的是在外面事情弄得不好，沒有面目回去見「江東父老」，雖然自己是怎樣地在深深憶念着自己的家人。</p>
<p>最後我不妨把上海歌舞班的情形略説一説。「明月」「梅花」「霞影」是在上海哄動過一時而有相當聲譽的。「集美」「銀花」「明明」「華光」「桃花」「上</p>
<p>海」等歌舞班則或在大世界，大千世界，先施樂園，小世界等遊戲塲獻藝而維持自己的生存，或打入三四等影戲院而和戲院老板三七或四六拆賬分點餘瀝，或到外埠去「開碼頭」賺點錢—他們的事業大半都是很艱苦的。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸ</p>
<h3>德國經濟研</h3>
<p>— 究兆</p>
<p>希特勒自去年一月三十日掛了帥印以後，就連續地宣佈了很多的統制經濟政策。其中如失業救濟政策，農村復興政策，输出貿易增進政策，國内消費增進政策，馬克封鎖政策等等，都是赫赫著名的。這些統制政策實施以來，固然部份地獲得了少許成績，然而統觀全盤，則仍舊是毫無成效。</p>
<p>先就失業救濟政策來説。在官方所報告的數字上，雖説是從去年二月底到今年二月底减少了將近三百萬人（去年二月底爲六百萬人，今年二月底爲三百三十萬人），然而實際上究竟是否可靠，那還不無疑問。就假定這數字是可靠的，我們也不能因而斷定國社黨的政策收了絶大的實效。這只要看一看下述的情形便可洞悉。</p>
<p>第一，國社黨爲了要减少失業的人數，把結了婚的女工，一槪停職。理由是，丈夫旣然有工可作，妻子便應該留在家裏料理私務。爲了美滿地達到這個目的，他們更巧妙地運用了「賢妻良母主義」的口號來彈壓羣衆的反感。</p>
<p>第二，是大家所熟知的，國社黨以ＸＸ黨，社會民主黨和猶太人爲他們最大的仇敵。因而所有隸屬ＸＸ黨，社會民主黨和籍隸猶太的勞動者，不分男女老幼，一槪逐之出境。這樣自然也會减少一批失業者。</p>
<p>第三，在國社黨的失業救濟策之下，又巧立了一種强迫勞役制度。卽一切工作完全由政府分配，不管你願意作或不願意作。在這種强迫勞役制之下所得的工作，大半都是軍需工業中的事務和軍隊裏的雜務。</p>
<p>此外還規定着勞動者不得兼職。</p>
<p>由於以上諸條件所犧牲的勞動者，我們雖然得不到精確的數字（事實上也是不可能的），然而只要把過去一年間德國各種勞動情報檢查一下，便可立卽明瞭德國官方報告的虚僞性。</p>
<p>現在讓我們再來看一看國社黨的農村復興政策吧。國社黨的農業統制政策和其他資本主義國家一樣，也是從提高農產品價格入手的。在這種政策之下，一方面是限制外國農產品的輸入，一方面則採取公定農產品價格的方略。這政策實施之後，果然見到些微的效力，農產品的批發物價指數在去年一月爲八○九，至八月便漲到八七八了。農民固然得到少許利益，然而在工資節節下降的勞動者却遭遇了非常的苦况。如是，農村復興政策與失業救濟政策又恰恰站在矛盾的兩極上了。</p>
<p>在國内的情形旣已如此，那末對外的情形又怎樣呢？這裏又是一個矛盾。國社黨雖然積極地努力增進輸出，無如在對外匯價上却處於非常不利的地位，所以很難突破重圍（因爲德國仍舊維持金本位的緣故）。在這種塲合，國社黨便决定採取馬克封鎖政策，就是説，一切外國人所擁有的馬克資金都不得運出德境之外，而完全封鎖於德境之内。國社黨利用了這種政策，在匯兌上纔稍稍站得住脚（詳細情形，當另文叙述），然而在貿易上却仍舊沒有什麽好的效果。</p>
<p>此外，在賠欵問題上，在財政問題上，在金融危機上，亦復沒有完滿地解决。所以，統觀國社黨一年來執政的成績與其在未上臺前對民衆所預約的諾言，實在還相差太遠。</p>
<p>業餘修學研究文學</p>
<h3>應有的槪念</h3>
<p>— 風</p>
<p>（一）文學不是神秘的東西「什麽呌做文學？」對於這問題的答案實在太多了。但包含較多正確的成分，而被一般人認爲是一種公理或常識來應用的，是蒲列哈諾夫所下的解釋：</p>
<p>「藝術是表現（正確的説應該是反映）人類底感情與思想的，不過這種表現，並不是抽象的表現，而是用活生生的形象表現的。這就是藝術的主要特質。人們受到周團的現實環境底影響，而在自己底内部，重新喚起他所經騐的感情與思想，然後用一定的形象把這種感情與思想表現出來，這就是藝術。」</p>
<p>不用説，文學是用文字作牠一定的形象而表現的一種藝術。</p>
<p>換句話説：「文學是社會現象的一種，是上層的意識形態的一種映象。我們考察文學發展的過程，必須根據整個的社會構造的變遷，决不能把文學當做一種脱離了基本社會構造的，超越的，獨特的東西。已往社會的發展，依據社會生產方法的不同，可以劃分做：</p>
<p>古代社會，對建社會和資本主義社會。文學的發展，也可以依據社會的發展階段，同樣分做：古代社會文學，封建社會的文學和資本主義的文學。」　　世上沒有超越一切的創造主。文學也不能不帶些烟火氣；不能成爲浮泛在社會活動底圈外的泡沬。就是那些高唱藝術高於一切，抱有神秘觀點的人們，他那腦子内的神秘觀，也是社會的產物，有牠社會的根據。追根到底，也無一點神</p>
<p>秘可説。</p>
<p>這是開始研究文學的人先應有的槪念。</p>
<p>（二）文學中的「偏見」</p>
<p>文學旣然是一種很平常的人們受到周圍的現實環境的影響，而在自己底内部，重新喚起他所經騐的感情與思想，然後用文字的形象，把牠表現出來的東西，自然，牠不是無内容的抽象。牠必有意識的，或無意識的，代表一種宇宙觀和人生觀。就是牠必代表現實的生活競爭上一種偏見，無可否認。</p>
<p>這一種「偏見」，成爲了作品的骨髓。好的文學作品，牠的成功不僅在造形上。文字的美，音調的美，及以結構表現上的美，雖然是文學上必要的條件，但不是决定的最後的條件。我們第一要把握的還是牠的思想這一種偏見。</p>
<p>完全「中性的」無偏見的作品，嚴格説，自古以來一篇都沒有過。所謂純粹的藝術，牠的象牙之塔，就是他的偏見。</p>
<p>他仍是主張維持象牙之塔的安全，明明白白還是同情，支持旣成的一種支配的思想的。</p>
<p>社會的意識是一種印烙，牠必公正的，不可逃避的，打在每一個作品上面了。</p>
<p>因此，從事文學研究的人，第一要注意的，是一篇作品所代表的思想是什麽。不論牠是一首詩，一篇小説，一幕戲劇；甚至一段小品文字，都不能輕輕的把牠放過。不能只耽玩作品的文字，或注意於其音調，或玩味其結構，或贊賞其表現法。</p>
<p>這些美麗的衣裳，有時可以遮去了牠的本來面貎；但細心的讀者，仍能看出牠的原形來。</p>
<p>不了解一篇作品的思想，根本就不能談文學。</p>
<p>（三）文學的敎育的作用</p>
<p>無論你如何否認所謂「功利」的見解，説文學是供人欣賞，而無其他的作用；無論你如何推崇藝術至上主義，藝術的獨立性與超越性，事實上文學本身是克盡了敎育的任務。不管你意識着或沒有意識着，承認或不承認。</p>
<p>一個人的思想，常常因受了一篇作品的影響，致有前後判若二人的差異。有許多人，因此而往前邁進；也有許多人，因此而墮落，頽廢。自古以來，就有歌功頌德的文章，也有譏世，反抗，叛逆，無道的創作。他們都在代表一個偏見，以敎育大衆。這並不是新的發現，是自古有之的事。　　文學之所以能成爲敎育之最大的利器，就是因爲牠不是直接的訴諸理智，而是以理智與感情融和，化爲具象的炎燄，燒着你的靈魂。你在這裏面可以認識更大的世界，領會各種各樣的生活，啓發了你的聰慧，認淸你的人生，一篇詩歌，一齣悲劇的效力，有時甚過一章宗敎的説敎，一條科學的原理。牠有無限的威力，使你成爲牠的俘虜，一點也無怨言。</p>
<p>有好多人，他在實生活中，社會科學中，認淸了人生。也有好多人，先從事文學而後纔感到社會科學之重要，轉而或同時去研究社會科學。　　所以研究文學，不應抱消閑排遣的態度，要從這中間取得你所尋覓的東西，在這中間去訓練你自己。</p>
<p>這是我們要窺探的知識的一角落。</p>
<p>（四）文學不是文人的專業自從體力勞動與腦力勞動</p>
<p>分裂而爲對立的發展以後，隨着生產關係的演進，後者獨佔了知識的全領域，自然文學成了文人的專業。</p>
<p>由於過去文學上的遺產的堆集，時至今日，文學與其他的藝術一樣，在表現上已有着豐富，複雜，優美的經騐與　術。這些要素不是未受過相當敎養的人所可問津，更由社會的分業越精，文學家更變成腦力勞作者中的一部分優秀者的專業了，在資本主義社會中，雖然下層勞作者亦有一部分得到低級敎育的機會，但農工作家還很少能由此產出。</p>
<p>一般人的頭腦裏，大致都認作一不是文人不必班門弄斧罷！」就是很富於文學思想的人，他們口頭上能説出很富於文學趣味的話，但他並不從事寫作。</p>
<p>這是一種偏見，因襲的偏見，是文學園地的一種重大的損失。</p>
<p>現在，我們要打破這種因襲之見。</p>
<p>我們讀文學作品，研究文學，同是還提出我們也要動手來寫作。我們沒有感情與思想則已，如有，我們就可以把牠寫出。我們要學習寫作技術，但技術不是文學的主體，牠不過是表現的手段罷了。</p>
<p>文學的鑑賞，旣不限於文人的專業；文學創作，自然也無例外。我們要使文學的園地更爲豐富，我們需要知道從各社會層人們的手中寫出他親切的生活的眞實。這也是我們業餘讀者應有的槪念，希望利用業餘的時間也來寫作。</p>
<p>（五）我們的出發點是具象的現代的文學</p>
<p>以上的槪念，對於開始從事研究文學的人提供了一個較</p>
<p>正確的傾向。在從事一門學問研究時，如果在出發點就犯上了錯誤，那他以後的努力便都會變爲白費，這是很重要的。以下還要説明我們爲什麽把研究的範圍祇限於近代這一横斷面？</p>
<p>第一，是我們研究的出發點應該是一個具體的社會意識形態的結晶體。那末，這結晶體當然是我們目前生活的社會。我們不能從離開現在已遠的社會意識之結晶體作爲出發點</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>第二，近代的社會生活比較容易了解些，而且對於近代文學作品，興趣自然也濃厚些。所以我們先後我們容易了解的開始。</p>
<p>第三，因爲近代生活，我們實有澈底了解的必要。我們爲了自己的生活，我們應從文學中去擴大我們的認識，敎育自己。</p>
<p>第四，我們都是業餘的讀者，沒有充分的有閒時間去研究古代；離開我們的需要太遠的古代。</p>
<p>第五，研究學問，從上而下的研究法，固然是一種方法，但從下而上的研究法，亦不失爲良法。我們能了解這一階段後，如果自己要深造，有一這種基礎，自然以後自己可逆上去，一一研究。</p>
<h3>論如何加强勞資合作的基礎？</h3>
<p>— 鋼</p>
<p>在這勞資雙方的感情，一天天地惡化的今日，除了當局應負任　以　外，我們每個人都該一致地關切到罷工這個問題！因此我們需要考究每次勞資對抗的因果，我廠主處置的方法，藉增彼此的經騐，中强勞資合作的基礎</p>
<p>方法，就是處置事業的技能事業的能否成功就全靠在處事技能的優劣。在歷史上，有許多的糾紛，都是爲了處置手叚的拙劣，才引起不可牧收的混亂。可是直到現在，一般人還是因循苟且，不知自悟，來圖處事方法的進步。所以，在近年來，每個工廠裏，都有層出不窮的勞資爭吵。罷工風潮，此仆彼起，竟至一瀉千里，造成今日的難堪局面。</p>
<p>如此局面，廠方固須負其全責；而政府方面，實也難辭其咎。聽任廠方意氣用事，因襲舊法，不知力求支配工人方法的改進，仍採取一貫的强硎硬政策，不斷地激動工人的反感。如某廠的罷工，其原因就是在一貫地採用這種政策壓制工人，指揮巡捕槍擊工人，以至於逮捕工人代表。這種處置方法的拙</p>
<p>劣，眞足令人失色，顯然地事變的結局，是增强勞資的對立了！</p>
<p>幸而，採取這種拙劣的方法，而不善於制裁工人的廠主，尚非全局如此。間有少數賢明者，亦能使用較進步的方法。像某製罐廠，牠的應付工人確很周到。例如遇有怠惰不善工作的工人或不肖分子，牠就能用很充分的理由，如像廠裏某部機器或房室遭了毁損，亟待修理等理由，不聲張的從事單個的散發工資，而囑他們暫時停工，等到廠内修理完畢，卽行通知來廠上工。牠用這種進步的方法，在去年一年裏面，雖因種種萬不得已的關係，裁去二百餘人（全廠共有人數聽説也祇有二百多人），而勞資雙方的表現，還是十二分地和恊，毫沒惡感的反映。</p>
<p>從此，我們可以知道，運用工人的方法，須力求改進，這樣多少總能减少罷工的指數。上述這個新式的進步的方法，至少也够得我們深切的注意。而那種拙劣的陳舊的方法，是須要把牠送進墳墓裏去！</p>

<h3>Crisis of Armaments Race: Unrestricted Production of Munitions Causes War; Requesting Congressional Approval of the Geneva Convention; Government Implementation of Arms Trade Management; Another Action by the U.S. to Participate in International Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today submitted a special message to Congress, strongly advocating urgent action to control the manufacture and secret transportation of arms and munitions. The President also asked the Senate to unanimously support the Senate Committee's investigation into private arms manufacturing and international arms transportation. The Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of War, signed in Geneva in 1925, is still in the Senate. President Roosevelt also requested its immediate approval. He further hoped that when representatives of major powers reconvene in Geneva on May 29, they would establish a more powerful convention to strictly limit and supervise the international transportation of arms and munitions, and to establish an international organization to implement this. He believes that many countries are suffering, and if governments recklessly engage in arms races again, the outcome will inevitably be war. Roosevelt also said, "The serious harm to world peace today is largely caused by the manufacturers and merchants of lethal weapons, so the people of all countries must unite to contain them." After the President's message was submitted, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman immediately submitted a committee report to the Senate approving the 1925 Geneva Convention for the Control of Arms and Munitions and announced that the President would soon submit another request to Congress, granting the power to issue arms embargoes to deal with the Gran Chaco War.

<p>Opium Advisory Committee Meeting</p>
<h3>The League of Nations' Atmosphere is Unfavorable to Us; British Representative's Account of Our Opium Suppression Report; Caused Negative Impressions in Various Quarters; Minister Hu Suggests Convening a General Assembly; To Study Drug Restriction and Management</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The British representative notified today's Opium Committee of the opium suppression report by Zhou Lisheng, a supervisory committee member of our country, published in the Interior Affairs Gazette in January. The commissioners were affected by this report, and their impressions were not good. There will be speech and actions that will be unfavorable to China's opium suppression efforts. (19th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Hu Shih-tse, the Chinese Minister to Switzerland, suggested at the meeting of the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee here today that a kind of general assembly be convened to study the possibility of restricting and managing the planting of poppies and coca leaves. The Advisory Committee decided to include this proposal on the agenda of the next session of the League of Nations Administrative Council. (18th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations today issued a circular, attached with a questionnaire, and sent it to China and various countries with concessions, settlements, and leased territories in China. The purpose of this circular and questionnaire is to facilitate cooperation between Chinese and foreign authorities on narcotics trade matters, with a particular focus on foreigners in China involved in the narcotics business.

<h3>Three Principles Regarding Pseudo-Postal Services; Our Country Has No Temporary Response; Still Handling Matters According to Established Policies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee of the League of Nations discussed the issue of pseudo-postal services and decided on three principles. According to sources in our diplomatic circles, our government does not want to express any attitude towards this decision for the time being. However, it is very clear that these three measures imply non-recognition of pseudo-organizations joining the Postal Convention. Member states adopt temporary measures without basing them on the Postal Convention. These temporary measures should be regarded as relations arising from maintaining postal technical operations, and cannot be regarded as relations between countries. This provision makes it even more obvious that the League of Nations does not recognize independent postal services of pseudo-organizations. As for our side's denial of pseudo-postal services, we will still adhere to our established policies, and have no intention of considering temporary measures. From our country's standpoint, we believe these three decisions cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory, but we believe that the League of Nations is still persisting in not recognizing pseudo-organizations.

<h3>British Economic Weekly Discusses; League of Nations Cooperation with China</h3>
<p>(London) "The Economist Weekly" recently published an article discussing China's evolution, stating in brief: "China's economic development provides unprecedented opportunities for international cooperation. As for Japan's desire to freely develop resources in China, benefiting Japan exclusively, it will not only be unacceptable to China, but also intolerable to other countries in the world. Regarding this matter, it is highly appropriate to establish a definite compromise with Japan to resolve it. It is fundamentally important for the League of Nations to continue to cooperate with China, because if China cooperates with the League of Nations, countries will no longer regard China as a hunting ground, and various financial groups will no longer compete with each other to obtain concessions or special interests from China. Moreover, cooperation between the League of Nations and China can also foster harmony between Eastern and Western peoples in economic development with a friendly spirit, which would be greatly beneficial."

<p>Japanese Troops Completely Withdraw from Ji County</p>
<h3>Withdrawing in Two Batches to Malanyu and Xinglong; Confiscated Militia Firearms Returned to County Government; Special Police Issue in War Zone Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) As a result of negotiations in Ji County yesterday between Mr. Shiba, representative of the Japanese army, and Qu Shihe, representative of Yin Rugeng, regarding the Japanese troops stationed in Ji County, both parties have reached an understanding. This morning, all troops withdrew from Ji County towards Malanyu. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qu Shihe went to Tianjin this morning to report to the provincial government on the handling of the Ji County incident. The Japanese troops in Ji County returned to Xinglong County this morning. When these Japanese troops were in Ji County previously, because many local villagers were panicked and fled, Lintian expressed dissatisfaction to County Magistrate Wu. Subsequently, after County Magistrate Wu repeatedly issued announcements to reassure the people, the area became slightly calmer. The two machine guns confiscated from the first district militia by the Lintian troops have been taken back to Tong County by Qu and handed over to the Commissioner's Office for safekeeping. The security teams stationed in Sanhe and Ji County will return to Ji County City to be stationed within one or two days. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shiba said that the Lintian contingent in Ji County City withdrew in two batches this morning at 6:00 AM, one batch to Malanyu and one batch to Xinglong Mountain. The confiscated militia firearms were returned to the county government. Sakata returned to Beiping last night to report to the embassy. The issue of receiving Malanyu was previously negotiated by Yin Rugeng and the Japanese side, but was put on hold due to certain reasons raised by the Japanese side midway. At this time, at the Yuguan meeting, in order to respect the spirit of the truce agreement, our side proposed to continue negotiations. After discussion between the two sides, our side still drafted a plan, which was telegraphed by Matsui to the Kwantung Army headquarters for instructions. It is expected that the takeover can be expected within the next month. However, the Japanese side pays great attention to the protection of the Eastern Tombs. Currently, there is a battalion of the pseudo-army Song Dingming's department in that area. A company of the Japanese 7th Division is stationed in Malanyu. Our side's takeover of Malanyu is also limited to the administrative part. The future protection of the Eastern Tombs is still subject to detailed discussion between the two sides. The location of Malanyu is important, and the Jiji-Miyun District Office plans to establish an office there. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong visited Shiba at the Japanese Embassy this morning and talked for an hour. The content is unknown. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) All machine guns of Wei Yonghe's security team were sent out of the war zone on the 18th to avoid the Japanese army in Ji County using it as an excuse to start a war. Because the machine guns of Wei Yonghe's unit were sent out of the war zone, the attitude of the Japanese troops stationed in Ji County has eased, and they will withdraw to Malanyu today and tomorrow. However, a part of the Japanese troops in the Mashan Bridge area is still showing tension, checking passersby and setting up sentry posts. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The newly formed special police force in the Ji area will be stationed in the Luanyi, Jiji, and Miyun administrative districts after the Japanese side does not insist on refusing to allow heavy firearms to be carried into the war zone. Currently, Yin Rugeng and Shiba are negotiating this matter in Beiping. The Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin have also dispatched their staff officer Ohashi to meet with Yu Xuezhong several times. Regarding the number of 8,000 special police officers, they believe that it is too many, because there are already three special security teams in the war zone: Zhao Lei, Liu Zuo Zhou, and Han Dianbang. According to the Tanggu Agreement, a total of 9,000 police officers can be stationed in the war zone, so only about 6,000 more can be deployed. Our side believes that the three units of Zhao Lei, Liu Zuo Zhou, and Han Dianbang are not formal special police teams and were introduced by the Japanese side, forcing the provincial government to reorganize them, and cannot be counted within the quota of 9,000. As for heavy firearms, they specifically refer to artillery positions, and the special police team carrying machine guns cannot be referred to as heavy firearms. Therefore, the two sides are still negotiating. The newly formed special police team is divided into two general teams, and one general team is further divided into two district teams, each district team divided into four brigades, and each brigade into four companies. The first general team leader is Zhang Qingyu, and the second general team leader is Zhang Yantian, stationed in southern Tianjin, Cangzhou, and Caicun, awaiting orders to deploy.

<h3>Japanese Army Establishes Arms Depot in Harbin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army recently established an arms depot in Harbin, and a large number of arms and ammunition are transported there every two days, and then transferred to various roads in Labin Huhu, and transported to the Russian-Manchurian border. The situation between Japan and Russia has recently become increasingly tense. People in Harbin are extremely unstable. The railway between Beianzhen and Heihe has been completed for more than 160 li, and is currently being actively constructed. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>

In the evening, he went to Qinhuangdao for inspection. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>
<h3>The Beiping-Liaoning Railway's Income and Expenditure in the Pingyu Section Can Still Offset Each Other</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The main source of income for the Beiping-Liaoning Railway is the Kailuan Coal Mine. Since the section of the railway outside the pass was seized by the Japanese side, the income and expenditure of the Pingyu section can still offset each other. The loss of the section outside the pass is very large, so the Japanese side is actively demanding the resumption of traffic. Their intention is not only to induce the de facto recognition of the pseudo-state. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Financial Conference Agenda Focuses on Proposal Review</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) 75 financial conference proposals have been received, and 82 people have registered to attend the conference. The conference schedule has been set, focusing on detailed discussions in the review committees. Therefore, there will be fewer plenary sessions and more review committee meetings. The abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies is not a concern for compensation, as long as there is a good method of rectification. Eliminating the evils will not reduce taxes, and may even increase them. If a method of reforming micro-collections can be achieved, the harassment of the people will be eliminated, and the tax revenue will not be damaged. Eliminating embezzlement, adjusting expenditures, then excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies will be abolished without abolishing them. The claim of compensation is an excessive worry due to a lack of understanding of the situation. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiangsu Finance Minister Zhao Dihua came from Zhenjiang to register for the Financial Conference. Zhao said that Jiangsu Province had four proposals to the Financial Conference: 1. Unifying the titles of land taxes and dividing land taxes into provincial and county taxes; 2. Determining the scope of abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies and developing other compensation methods; 3. License taxes for tobacco and alcohol should be managed by the province; 4. Dividing the scope of business tax and consolidated tax. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Su Tiren, Director of the Finance Department of Suiyuan, came to Beijing on the morning of the 19th to attend the Financial Conference. According to him, Suiyuan Province's finances have a deficit of approximately 1 million yuan each year, and the central government does not provide any subsidies. The province's income is only around 1.3 million yuan in assistance from the Shanxi-Gansu consolidated tax, 600,000 yuan in land tax, 300,000 yuan in actual revenue, and 300,000 yuan in other miscellaneous tax revenue. If there is a method of compensation for abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies at this Financial Conference, it will not be difficult for Suiyuan Province to implement the abolition. Suiyuan Province has no proposals this time. After the meeting, he will personally present everything to the Minister of Finance and request that the central government provide a monthly subsidy of several tens of thousands of yuan to maintain the province. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Guo Zhihan, Director of the Finance Department of Chahar, Su Tiren, Director of the Finance Department of Suiyuan, and Guo Binghe, Director of the Qingdao Finance Bureau, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 19th. Guo said that Chahar Province's tax revenue is only over 300,000 yuan per month, which is not enough to cover expenses. He also requested that the central government restore transportation between Zhangjiakou and Kulun. Su said that Suiyuan Province's expenditures exceed one million yuan, and he plans to request assistance from the central government. In addition, Zhao Dihua, Director of the Finance Department of Jiangsu, arrived in Beijing from Zhenjiang on the morning of the 19th, along with proposals for reorganizing finance and taxation, and attended the Financial Conference. (19th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Dihua, Director of the Finance Department of Jiangsu, said that Jiangsu Province's total annual revenue is over 20 million yuan, with land tax revenue as the main body, approximately over 10 million yuan per year. The current revenue and expenditure are both insufficient. The deficit for the 22nd year was approximately 2 million yuan. The budget for the 23rd year has been drafted, with the addition of water conservancy construction costs, for a total annual expenditure of several million yuan. In terms of taxation, it is hoped that the revenue and expenditure will be balanced in the future. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>

Zhang said that Hunan Province has three proposals for the Financial Conference. In addition to the proposal made by Chairman He requesting that the central government grant local officials the right to supervise local national taxes, the remaining proposals are for reducing excessive taxes, determining local budgets, and developing methods of promotion after abolishing excessive taxes.

<h3>President Wang Hosts Inspection Delegation from Guangdong Press Circles; Detailed Description of Domestic Production and Construction</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 4 p.m. on the 19th, President Wang held a tea party at the Executive Yuan to host the inspection delegation from the Guangdong and Hong Kong press circles. During the meeting, Wang detailed the domestic production and construction situation, stating in brief that in recent decades, China's backward economy has resulted in the lack of necessary constructions for a modern country. Therefore, production and construction are the most urgent priorities, and China's true unification must also be sought through construction. However, construction must have steps. First, eliminate accumulated evils. All unreasonable and non-modern systems should be abolished and replaced with reasonable and modern systems. In terms of people, all corrupt officials, arrogant soldiers, and unruly generals should be eliminated. Only after the first step is achieved can we enter the second step of active construction. For example, suppressing bandits is the greatest function of eliminating accumulated evils, and at the same time, eliminating the corrupt officials, arrogant soldiers, and unruly generals within ourselves is also the greatest function of eliminating accumulated evils. As for the system, it is not certain whether it can be rationally improved due to various constraints. However, this direction cannot be uncertain and still requires the greatest effort, because if this matter cannot be achieved, then the so-called elimination of accumulated evils will still be empty talk.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Suggests Implementing New Salt Law; Salt Bureau Believes There are Still Many Points to Consider</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Legislators Chen Changheng and others advocated the prompt implementation of the New Salt Law. The previous day, they moved at the general assembly to propose to the central government to order the competent authorities to formulate the New Salt Law Enforcement Law in order to implement the New Salt Law on a set date, promote refined salt, and strictly prohibit unscrupulous merchants from selling adulterated inferior salt to avoid harming the people. It was also resolved to hand it over to Jiao Yitang, Ma Yinchu, Lu Zhiyi, Chen Changheng, etc. for review. Jiao Yitang convened a meeting scheduled for next week to discuss, gather opinions, draft a proposal, and submit it to the general assembly for approval. However, according to the Salt Bureau, since the New Salt Law was passed, the salt authorities have believed that many changes have been made and it is by no means possible to achieve everything in one step. For example, the recovery of salt coupons and the repayment of debts take a lot of time. Therefore, although the Salt Bureau is considering the implementation law, it has not yet finalized it. The situation of customs and salt affairs is more complicated than usual, and the audit system is also unclear to outsiders. Therefore, implementing the New Salt Law is considered to have many points to consider and needs to be discussed at length. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>
<h3>General Staff Stipulates Treatment for Military Attaches of Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Staff believes that many of the military attaches of various countries stationed in China have no fixed whereabouts. Even in the locations of provincial and municipal governments, foreign military attaches openly establish offices and interact with local officials, or request special treatment. This violates international reciprocity and equality and harms national sovereignty. It is urgent to find ways to correct this. After deliberation, it has been decided that in the future, foreign military attaches coming to China, unless their country's embassy officially notifies our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and puts them on record, will not be treated as resident military attaches, that is, they will not be given special convenience. This has been submitted to the Military Council for referral to the Executive Yuan to order the provinces, cities, and military agencies to comply. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>

The Hebei Provincial Government has reached an agreement with the banking community in Tianjin to temporarily overdraft 500,000 yuan, which will be taken by Hu Yuanhui, a member of the provincial commission, to the work area in southern Hebei to start work in advance, so as to avoid being unable to construct when the flood season arrives.

Telephone lines were burned, and one staff member was knocked down but quickly recovered. Everyone suspected it was an electrical phenomenon. (19th Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>Japan Wants to Resolve Issues with China</p>
<h3>To Cope with Extraordinary Times; No Compromise on All Sino-Japanese Issues; Fear that it will Have a Serious Impact on Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The critical issue of Japan's relations with China is now being addressed with unified efforts by the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy to resolve disputes and restore normal relations between the two countries with sincerity. So far, these efforts have not touched on the overall situation, but if the current atmosphere of gloom and uncertainty is left unattended, Japan, which is already facing extraordinary times, may experience serious consequences. Therefore, the Japanese government should establish a firm policy towards China at this time, declaring it to both domestic and foreign audiences, and implementing it thoroughly. Such opinions are gradually gaining strength, and the trend towards their materialization is very strong, attracting attention from all quarters. The core points of such opinions are as follows: China policy should focus on peace in East Asia, so China should be urged to exercise restraint. At the same time, Japan should also relinquish a considerable degree of hope in dealing with China. (18th Denchu Telegraph)</p>

<h3>On the British Foreign Secretary's Explanation of the Nine-Power Treaty</h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday explaining the Nine-Power Treaty are based on safeguarding the interests of the British Empire itself. We also feel that it is sufficient to encourage the willful aggression of ambitious people and make them worry-free. In the end, it will follow in the footsteps of British Foreign Secretary Grey in 1914 and promote the crisis of a second world war. As the saying goes, nurturing a tumor will cause trouble, which is frightening.</p>
<p>The failure of disarmament has become a foregone conclusion. Countries are expanding their armaments, and it is already underway. It is difficult to reverse the momentum. The severity of the world situation is no less than on the eve of the Great War. The United Kingdom is in this situation, and the relationship is the greatest. No matter whether a war breaks out in Western Europe or the Far East, its interests are threatened. Its actions also show a significant impact. Its strategists are trying to protect themselves. This is human nature, and who can criticize it? However, today, precisely because of its position, its relationship with various countries in the East and West is significant, and its interests are closely linked. A small change can affect the whole body, so it should be especially careful. Given the size of the British Empire, if it only seeks to protect itself at this time and does not make further strong representations to curb the rising tide of giant disasters, then once the general trend is inevitable, it will be difficult to preserve itself. Historians say that if British Foreign Secretary Grey had been able to announce to the Central European countries in a resolute declaration during the ten years after the Anglo-French Entente was established in 1904, saying that whoever wants to destroy peace, the United Kingdom will support France to confront them, then the European war catastrophe might have been avoided. The reason why the United Kingdom did not do this at that time had its own inevitable difficulties. However, what the historians said is not entirely without basis. Why doesn't Foreign Secretary Simon take this as a warning and try to remedy the situation, but instead make this new interpretation of the Nine-Power Treaty? We expect that the impact will not only suggest opportunities for ambitious people, but also be tantamount to regarding the Nine-Power Treaty as waste paper. British Labour Party leader Cripps criticized his government's policy towards Japan as being conniving and appeasing, which is not without reason.</p>
<p>It is a great humiliation for the territorial integrity of an independent and sovereign country to rely on others to guarantee it. The establishment of the Nine-Power Treaty was only intended to determine the balance of power policy of various countries in the East. Foreign Secretary Simon stated in the House of Commons debate on Japan's new policy towards China that the United Kingdom would insist on the rights and obligations stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty. At that time, he clearly stated that rights and obligations are equally important. Now, he suddenly says that there is a difference between respecting and guaranteeing territorial integrity. What is the intention? A treaty is a dead thing. How it is used, how it is interpreted, and how it is maintained and how it is discarded are still in the hands of the main people of the contracting countries. We are only a poor and weak member, of course, allowing others to interpret and manipulate it. Then, can the Chinese people's dream of appealing for justice not be awakened at all?</p>

<h3>Goals of Geneva Talks: Removing Obstacles to Soviet Russia's Entry into the League of Nations; Recognition by the Little Entente a Matter of Time</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, all parties are paying close attention to the meeting between French Foreign Minister Barthou and Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov. The two held talks from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM this afternoon. When reporters learned of this, they gathered at the hotel, seeking information about the content of the discussions. However, neither Barthou nor Litvinov were willing to reveal anything. Litvinov only stated that his visit was to discuss all current issues, but he declined to specify which issues. Nevertheless, it is widely understood that the "current issues" are none other than the question of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations. Furthermore, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu will also arrive here tomorrow and will continue discussions with Litvinov on the issues they began in Paris. It is also rumored that after Soviet Russia joins the League of Nations as a permanent member, Poland will also demand a permanent seat on the Council. However, this is not considered a major obstacle to Soviet Russia's entry, with the main obstacle being Switzerland's insistence on not recognizing Soviet Russia. (18th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Since the lengthy meeting last night between Soviet Russian Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Litvinov and French Foreign Minister Barthou, responsible figures here are increasingly convinced that Soviet Russia has decided to join the League of Nations. While the French representative to the League of Nations remains silent, they acknowledge that the main topic of discussion between the two was Soviet Russia's entry into the League. When several journalists inquired about this news from Litvinov, he simply laughed and said, "Today is good for fishing, isn't it?" Reliable sources believe that the Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar's visit at this time is a clear indication that the Soviet government is preparing for a formal discussion of this issue. The imminent arrival of Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu for a meeting with Litvinov further confirms the strength of this theory. Political observers note that France is particularly eager for Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations, especially after Foreign Minister Barthou's recent trip to Warsaw did not achieve complete success. At the same time, the Little Entente acknowledges that Poland clearly intends to go its own way, with some suggesting that Poland is now considering leaving the League of Nations and joining the German-Japanese bloc, which Italy may also join in the future. This morning, high-ranking diplomats firmly believe that the meeting between Litvinov and Titulescu will pave the way for the Little Entente to recognize Soviet Russia. The "Little Entente" refers to Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. Recognition by the Little Entente will be another basis for Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations. It is generally believed here that Titulescu is secretly acting as the representative of the Little Entente, as Romania's relationship with Soviet Russia is more complex than that of Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia. If there are no difficulties regarding the Bessarabia issue, and diplomats believe there will be none, then recognition is only a matter of time. The Little Entente's recognition of Soviet Russia will be another victory for Litvinov, as countries in South America will also unanimously recognize Soviet Russia after the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia. If the Little Entente restores relations with Soviet Russia, then the only European countries not in harmony with Soviet Russia will be the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Switzerland, Hungary, and Bulgaria. (19th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) All newspapers believe that the meeting between Foreign Minister Barthou and Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov in Geneva is of great significance in terms of the disarmament issue. They also state that the main objective of the meeting is the matter of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations. "Le Petit Parisien" stated, "If Barthou and Litvinov were not discussing Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations, then what were they talking about? It is rumored that Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations will be subject to conditions, such as the conclusion of a European mutual assistance pact, following the precedent of the non-aggression treaties signed by Soviet Russia with its neighbors, and including a clear definition of 'aggressor' in the League of Nations Covenant or the treaty on the limitation of armaments. In addition to this, the immediate recognition of Soviet Russia by the countries of the Little Entente must also be discussed." "Le Journal" stated, "The progress of the issue of Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations will affect Franco-Russian relations. If a European mutual assistance pact is concluded, including France's various defensive alliances, it will further promote Russian-French relations. There is no doubt that Barthou and Litvinov's talks in Geneva will focus on these two points." The newspaper also stated, "Neither side is willing to make any announcements regarding Barthou and Litvinov's meeting, but its content is actually a plan for Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations. France should assume the role of introducer, at least according to the Soviet side." "L'Echo de Paris" stated, "The biggest difficulty encountered by Soviet Russia in joining the League of Nations lies with Poland, because Poland argues that if Soviet Russia obtains a permanent seat on the Executive Council, then Poland should also be granted this seat." "Paris Soir" stated, "The decision on Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations will be made at the League of Nations General Assembly in September, as only the General Assembly has the power to decide on this matter." (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to French official sources, after the arrival of Soviet Union Foreign Commissioner Litvinov, he met with French Foreign Minister Barthou to discuss relations between France and Russia. Litvinov departed tonight for the Haute-Savoie department in France. Recently, Paris's "L'Echo de Paris" published an interesting account of this matter, stating, "Litvinov's trip has another purpose. The leader of the Soviet Russian anti-party faction, Trotsky, changed his name and shaved his beard, and is living in seclusion in Haute-Savoie. Moscow also wants Trotsky to repent on his own. Litvinov's trip to Haute-Savoie, as far as we know, is to persuade Trotsky to reconcile with the Soviet Russian authorities. Trotsky is a former friend of the Soviet Russian dictator Stalin."

<h3>League of Nations Executive Council Meeting Coming to a Close; Saar Issue Agreement Reached; British Arms Embargo Approved</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Italian representative Alessio, chairman of the League of Nations Executive Council's Special Committee on the Saar issue, met with French Foreign Minister Barthou today and decided that the Executive Council will meet tomorrow to review the conclusions and recommendations of the Saar Committee's work. The Committee will unanimously request the Executive Council to pass the proposed recommendations. It is reported that the proposed solution will satisfy all of France's legitimate demands. It is generally believed that this session of the Executive Council can conclude tomorrow. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Turkey Dissatisfied with the Lausanne Treaty, Especially with the Prohibition of Fortifications in the Straits, Intends to Request Amendments from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(London) According to a report in the Daily Telegraph on the 23rd of last month, the Turkish government has made representations to various governments, requesting the cancellation of the clauses in the 1923 Lausanne Treaty regarding the removal of military installations in the Dardanelles Straits, so that Turkey can build fortifications on both sides of the Straits and maintain neutrality in the event of a future war. The Turkish government now indicates that it intends to submit this request to the League of Nations. Officials are taking a reserved attitude on this matter. It is generally believed that Turkey is currently in the exploratory stage of international diplomatic atmosphere. If Turkey intends to formally make a request, then its Foreign Minister Rüştü will personally go to Geneva. There is currently no news to predict Rüştü's intention to go to Switzerland, but this is not impossible. Britain will inevitably feel uneasy about Turkey's attitude. The British government will probably adhere to its traditional policy and oppose the construction of fortifications in the Dardanelles Straits. But if Turkey decides to disregard the opposition, what will Britain do? This is what people want to know. London is now also talking about the countries that signed the Lausanne Treaty acting together, which is of considerable significance. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Britain's Ambitions</p>
<h3>Building a First-Class Air Force Power; Lacking Strong Strength, Unable to Exercise Sanctions; Baldwin Explains Position in the House of Commons; Disarmament Turns into Arms Expansion</h3>
<p>(London) Today, after Privy Council Minister Baldwin concluded the foreign policy debate in the House of Commons, Parliament announced its adjournment until May 29. Baldwin's speech mainly concerned the disarmament situation, stating that if the disarmament conference temporarily fails, the country should not be discouraged. Limiting armaments is the only practical way to disarm. There is now an overflow in the air. If you agree to restrictions, then I don't know how to avoid sanctions against those who violate the restrictions. When you rise up to oppose sanctions, you are rising up to oppose war. We have been driven to make many resolutions. One is that there is no such thing as sanctions that do not cause war. Unless you are prepared to fight seriously at will, participating in the joint maintenance of peace is useless. If you say that you can guarantee peace by force, but there is no preparation in peacetime, then it is more harmful to the world, and more fraudulent than anything else. If joint guarantees or sanctions must be implemented rigorously, Britain's strength must be far greater than it is today. He meant that it is very important for Britain to declare its position in Europe to the world. He is very worried about the atmosphere that Britain feels. However, the country must trust the government to a certain extent. At the same time, he is willing to offer a guarantee, that preparatory work is now underway. If the fear of the future Geneva Conference unfortunately comes true, then it is necessary to implement the recent words regarding increasing the strength of the air force, and not to slacken for a day. When the crowd heard Baldwin's words, cheers erupted from all sides. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Britain is now preparing to double its air force strength whenever it is arranged, and jump to the first position among air force countries. This is the meaning of Baldwin's speech in the House of Commons yesterday. Baldwin's statement revealing how to jump to become part of the first-class air force country has attracted great attention. Newspapers generally believe that the government has done a lot of work, airfield sites have been surveyed, and the convenience of training drivers has been increased. Furthermore, British aircraft and automobile manufacturing plants have the latest equipment and have the capacity to hold a large number of aircraft. At the same time, some newspapers say that an additional budget for increasing the strength of the British air force has been drafted. It is heard that Britain's planned sky convention, which prohibits sky bombing and stipulates that signatory countries are jointly obligated to bomb violators, has now been cancelled, because some cabinet members do not agree with this plan. It is found that Britain currently has 1,400 aircraft, while France has about 3,000, making it the strongest air force country in the world. It is now heard that the remarks of British Privy Council Minister Baldwin will have what kind of reaction, which is also something worth noting. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Dismissed and Imprisoned for Bribery; Taiwan Bank Bribery Case Confirmed; Dragged from Bed by Police in the Early Morning</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At 5:45 AM today, Finance Ministry Vice Minister Kuroda was urged out of bed by police officers, hurriedly put on his clothes, and was taken to the local prosecutor's office. According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, officials will issue an arrest warrant soon. Kuroda's detention is reportedly related to the Taiwan Bank illegal incident. He is now imprisoned pending trial. According to the Tokyo Shimbun, Taiwan Bank President Shimada and several directors of the bank and the Imperial Rayon Company are also detained awaiting trial. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The content of the Kuroda Vice Minister issue is quite complex. It is impossible to predict to what extent it will develop in the future. Whether Finance Minister Takahashi will resign to take responsibility is attracting a lot of attention. Its impact on the Saito Cabinet is significant. The government is now wary of political circles using this issue to carry out a cabinet overthrow movement. (19th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Ministry Vice Minister Kuroda was detained by the authorities on suspicion of participating in a stock manipulation case in June 1933. This matter may cause a serious cabinet crisis. It is found that Taiwan Bank President Shimada has been dismissed because of this case, and four directors of the Imperial Rayon Company have also been detained on suspicion of participating in the same case. Mr. Kuroda refused to resign to take responsibility, so Prime Minister Saito may be forced to dismiss Kuroda. There are also rumors that Finance Minister Takahashi may resign. This manipulation case will deal a major blow to the government, as several cabinet members have already been accused of bribery and resigned. The corruption of official governance is greatly criticized by public opinion. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At today's cabinet meeting this afternoon, the Japanese government decided to dismiss Finance Ministry Vice Minister Kuroda. His successor will be decided within one or two days. Finance Minister Takahashi said that Mr. Kuroda's issue can be dealt with according to previous cases (meaning to be dealt with according to the Civil Service Appointment Order), so the government may as well decide on its attitude after observing the development of the situation. (19th Denstu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo District Court Prosecutor's Office completed its interrogation of Finance Ministry Vice Minister Kuroda at 2:00 PM. As a result, the crime of bribery was clear, and it was decided to formally prosecute. Because Justice Minister Shibayama entered the palace at 2:00 PM this afternoon and obtained the Emperor's sanction, Vice Minister Kuroda will be imprisoned today. (19th Denstu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Ministry Vice Minister Kuroda, who was summoned by the Tokyo District Court Prosecutor's Office, has been transferred to preliminary trial after it was decided to prosecute. After being arrested and interrogated by preliminary trial judge Ryokaku, he was taken by car to Ichigaya Prison at 4:26 PM this afternoon. (19th Denstu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's handling of the case of Vice Minister Kuroda, who was summoned on suspicion of bribery, has had a great impact on the political situation, especially since the 19th, it has shown its tense mood. Finance Minister Takahashi summoned Administrative Vice Minister Horikiri to his residence to discuss countermeasures. The Prime Minister's secretary, Mr. Irimano, visited Mr. Horikiri on behalf of Prime Minister Saito to discuss how to deal with the aftermath. Mr. Ono, special bank director, visited the Finance Minister, and Agriculture Minister Goto also rushed to meet with Home Minister Yamamoto to secretly discuss the matter. Prime Minister Saito has stopped going to Hayama. Government officials are traveling frequently, which is extremely tense. The future of the cabinet is very uneasy, which is attracting a lot of attention. (19th Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>US Government Research</p>
<h3>Silver Representative Rogers Reports; US Treasury Acquires Large Quantities of Silver; International Silver Conference Still Too Early</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced that the report of President's advisor Professor Rogers has been received on schedule and is being studied deeply by the government. Rogers is currently in China investigating the silver situation. If the proposed silver plan stipulates the purchase of silver at home and abroad, then many technical adjustments in the world situation will be necessary. For example, what impact will the United States' purchase of large quantities of silver have on countries such as China? The stability of prices in China changes with the price of silver. This is one of many issues that Rogers needs to investigate clearly in China. Other issues include what steps should be taken after silver becomes nationalized to prevent silver from flowing out of the United States. Responsible officials told the Associated Press today that newspaper speculation that a world silver conference will be convened is premature. The White House has recently denied the issue of a world silver conference to inquirers, and the Treasury Department does not want to criticize this issue. The Senate side stated that if the bill stipulates that silver be nationalized, then it is inherently national in nature, but silver is also global in nature, so the national and international nature of silver must eventually be reconciled. However, the United States and other silver-producing and silver-using countries participating in the London Silver Agreement believe that the establishment of a new silver law will be the prelude to any international plan, and this international plan is necessary to maintain parity. (17th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources today, the Treasury Department's $200 million exchange stabilization fund has now been used to purchase large quantities of silver. According to responsible officials, $25 million of this fund has been used to purchase silver in the past two or three weeks. The statistics of the Federal Reserve announced in New York today are generally regarded as a suspension of the stabilization fund's purchase of silver. The White House announced today that President Roosevelt will draft a special silver message on the Potomac River yacht tonight and tomorrow, and submit it to Congress on Monday. Observers believe that this stabilization fund will often be used to purchase silver in bulk under the proposed new silver plan. It is believed that the purchase of silver on the world market will be carried out secretly to seek the lowest price. (18th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The London Financial Times commented on the development of the silver incident in Washington today, saying that silver now accounts for 12% of the metallic reserves of US currency. The US authorities have not yet announced how much currency they intend to issue using silver as collateral, but if the US government adopts a normal policy, then the world's existing silver that can be purchased is not enough to cover 25% of the US's existing currency reserves. The United States will of course announce to the public that its establishment of a 25% silver reserve is only complying with the recommendations of the London Conference. However, since the silver that can be collected now is not enough to cover 25% of the dollar's reserves, then other countries in the world will not be able to follow the example of the United States. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) According to a report from the Federal Reserve today, the US currency gold has decreased by more than $20 million in the past three weeks, and another $6,777,200 this week. The reason for this has not been explained. Wall Street believes that the decrease in currency gold is due to the Treasury Department allocating gold to the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund for use in managing foreign exchange when needed.

<h3>German Debt Conference Stalls</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The long-standing conference between German creditors' representatives and the German National Bank has now stalled, adjourning until May 22. The news of the adjournment was announced today. It is widely believed that the reason for the adjournment is not only technical difficulties, but also the differences of opinion among the foreign creditors' representatives themselves. The representatives have long debated behind the scenes on the method of expanding exports using bonds. The Netherlands and Switzerland support Germany's claim to offset debts with bonds and increase exports as much as possible, but Sweden and the United States oppose this as a solution to Germany's debt problems. Today, the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung reported that German debts, including Dawes-Young and other preferential loans, must be suspended for at least 18 months and up to two years, otherwise Germany cannot be satisfied.

<h3>France Subsidizes Merchant Ships and Seafarers' Wages; House of Representatives Approves Appropriation of 154 Million Francs; Imports into France from Various Countries Will Be Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>(Paris) If the merchant marine wage subsidy bill passed by the House of Representatives today with 575 votes against 10 becomes law, then exporters to France will be greatly affected. The bill stipulates annual funding of approximately 154 million francs to subsidize merchant marine seafarers, reaching 10% of their wages, and awarding bonuses based on ship tonnage and speed. This funding is planned to be derived from a 3% import tax and an 8% increase in statistical taxes. Only French-made ships owned by wholly corporate-owned companies are eligible for this subsidy. During the House of Representatives debate on the bill today, it was revealed that 27% of French merchant ships have been laid up since January of this year. It is also found that 11% of British ships are currently laid up, 15% of German ships, and 14% of Italian ships. It is believed that when the bill is submitted to the Senate, it may be greatly amended by that body. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Investigation of the Current Situation of the German Krupp Factory: Manufacturing Power Not Comparable to Pre-War</h3>
<p>(London) The London Morning Post, due to rumors that Germany is rapidly revitalizing its military, dispatched a special reporter to the German heavy industrial area of Ruhr to investigate everything, because the Krupp Steel Factory there was known as the "arsenal of Germany" before the European War. Therefore, the reporter went to visit the factory. Dr. Krupp, the owner of the factory, specially sent a representative to receive them and guide them through everything in the factory. According to the factory representative, rumors that the factory has hired 7,000 additional workers to meet the government's order for 200,000 new soldiers' rifles are completely inaccurate. The factory has not received that order. Furthermore, the manufacturing capacity of the Krupp factory is far less than before the European War, because according to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, all important machinery in the factory has been destroyed. It cannot be expected to return to its original state without several years. As for the increase in workers, it is stipulated by the government's unemployment relief program and has nothing to do with the increase in military equipment. (18th Guomin Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Submits Account of Incident Involving Road Police in Xiaguan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) – Regarding the Huo Ziduan shooting case, the Ministry of Finance submitted a report to the Ministry of Railways on the 19th, stating that, according to Section Chief Bian Dingyuan, on the night of May 16th at 11:00 PM, because the Vice Ministers of the Ministry were taking a night train to Shanghai on official business, he went to Xiaguan Station to take care of things. All well-wishers and Zhongshan cars were parked in front of the Xiaguan Station entrance. At that time, a Zhongshan car also came to park, and the road police, according to regulations, drove it away and used a leather belt to beat the Zhongshan car driver. The Ministry's car driver saw the road police beating someone and tried to dissuade them. The road police suspected him of protecting the driver and began to beat him as well. The section chief ordered the Ministry's drivers to back away, and Railway Bureau Inspector Zhang also ordered the road police to stop fighting. The road police, on the contrary, cursed the inspector for helping outsiders and used abusive language. As the section chief, along with Chief of Guards Li Jianwu and clerk Huo Ziduan, were exiting the station, a shot was fired from behind, wounding Huo in the leg. The road police saw that Li Jianwu was carrying a handgun and immediately seized it. Upon inspection, the gun was found to be loaded with six bullets, none of which had been fired. The road police still dragged Li Jianwu away and also arrested car driver Yu Jinchuan, treating him like a major criminal, injuring him in the face and chest and beating him severely. Li Jianwu and Yu Jinchuan were both detained at the Railway Bureau. Fearing that there would be too much bloodshed, the section chief urgently asked Wang, the General Affairs Officer of the Central Bank, to send the injured clerk Huo Ziduan by car to Gulou Hospital for treatment. The section chief then negotiated directly with Road Police Section Chief Sun and released Chief of Guards Li Jianwu and car driver Yu Jinchuan at 12:00 PM on the 17th. However, Yu Jinchuan was injured on his face and arms and was also sent to the hospital for treatment. The perpetrator who fired the shot is unknown. When asked, the section chief made various excuses. However, the road police have a responsibility to protect travelers, and firing a gun inside the station, even if it was an external perpetrator, should be the responsibility of the road police. Moreover, the road police had guns, and no one else did, so the gun must have been fired by the road police. On the 17th, the bullet was extracted from Huo's leg at the hospital and was found to match the bullets of the road police's White Langlin handgun. In addition to continuing serious negotiations with Section Chief Sun to hand over the perpetrator, it is also reported that the Xiaguan Station road police shot clerk Huo Ziduan of this Ministry, causing a fracture in his leg, and assaulted and detained Chief of Guards Li Jianwu and car driver Yu Jinchuan, causing injuries. It is inferred that the road police suspected the Ministry's personnel of protecting the driver, which led to the illegal arrest. However, it is known that only the road police had guns, so it could not have been fired by anyone else. Moreover, the road police and the drivers were fighting, and many people were watching, but only personnel of this Ministry were injured, so it cannot be argued that it was an accidental injury. Therefore, regardless of the circumstances, the road police cannot shirk their responsibility. They should be fully responsible for the physical safety and lives of the injured personnel of this Ministry, as a warning to evildoers and to prevent future troubles. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Chaozhou Customs Officers Deny Harassing Returning Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) – Overseas Chinese returning to the country reported to the Ministry of Finance that Chaozhou Customs officers were searching luggage and engaging in various forms of harassment, requesting that this be investigated and prohibited. The Ministry of Finance instructed the Inspector General of Customs to investigate and report back, stating that Chaozhou Customs has always provided special convenience for the luggage of returning overseas Chinese, making efforts to avoid inspections and releasing them immediately upon landing. However, there are times when tea porters and peddlers secretly place smuggled goods with the luggage of legitimate travelers, or pack them into boxes and suitcases labeled with foreign hotel tags, pretending to be returning overseas Chinese and accompanying them, or even travelers who, at the request of tea porters and hotel touts, allow smuggled goods to be hidden in their luggage, hoping to evade taxes. The Customs considers the situation suspicious, making it necessary to conduct inspections. There are also travelers who carry entire batches of goods, so many that they could even open a small shop. For example, one person brought six new bicycles without declaring them for customs duties. The Customs cannot but detain them in such cases. In fact, the Customs strictly prohibits private individuals from inspecting small merchandise and groceries brought by overseas Chinese returning to the country. Some overseas Chinese merchants, without understanding the situation, mistakenly believe that customs officers are extorting them, and the Customs is unjustly blamed. Therefore, the Customs not only does not harass returning overseas Chinese, but also treats them very generously, only fearing that unscrupulous individuals may impersonate Customs officers and harass overseas Chinese merchants. If any such incidents of impersonating Customs officers and harassing returning overseas Chinese occur in the future, the victims are allowed to take the perpetrators to the Supervisory Office for investigation and fair handling. If the matter involves criminal offenses, the supervisor will send them to the local judicial authorities for punishment according to the law. (19th)</p>

<h3>The Current Situation in Britain and Its Diplomacy – British Correspondence – Economic Alliances Gradually Forming – International Diplomacy Not Without Concerns</h3>
<p>Britain is an old power, yet it strives to maintain its unique advantages. In continental Europe, it aims to support its influential role, and globally, it seeks to maintain its position as a maritime hegemon. However, under the current circumstances, since Britain is determined to maintain the status quo, contain Germany, and preserve the Treaty of Versailles, it cannot avoid intervening in European affairs. Yet, there are two contradictions here: one is that the socialist Soviet Union is developing and becoming increasingly strong, which will influence the European balance of power; the other is the rise of the Hitler party, which not only threatens the Versailles system but also poses a serious threat to Britain. If a rift were to develop in the Franco-Italian-German triangular relationship, and even lead to armed conflict, how would Britain position itself? According to the Locarno Treaties, if the borders of France and Belgium are threatened, Britain would inevitably be drawn into the vortex of war. Even if Germany invades Poland and France sends troops, it would be difficult for Britain to stand idly by. Therefore, many in Britain advocate abolishing the Locarno Treaties to secure Britain's neutrality. However, the current situation hardly allows for such leisure, and the development of air power makes it impossible for Britain to isolate itself. Therefore, Britain is making efforts to mediate European disputes, hoping to revive the almost fossilized disarmament conference. If the disarmament conference can be reopened and a result of mutual concession between France and Germany can be achieved, the dangerous elements in Europe can at least be reduced. Even if the conference fails, it will be enough to delay the current situation and maintain a temporarily unbroken state. Indeed, Britain does not want Germany to restore the strong military power it possessed before the World War. However, after France is fully strengthened, although it may not necessarily seize British territory or threaten the security of British borders, colonies, and dominions, there are still problems in terms of economy and finance. Therefore, it secretly approves of the subtle antagonistic relationship between France, Italy, and Germany.</p>
<p>Over the past year or so, the economic conditions of the United States and other major capitalist countries such as France and Italy have been declining. For example, the foreign trade of the United States last year fell by 30% compared to the previous year, and by one-fifth compared to 1928. However, because Britain has used economic alliances, the centrifugal tendencies of various dominions and colonies have gradually slowed down, so its general economic situation has achieved relatively reliable stability in the turbulent current of the global economic panic.</p>
<p>The political manifestation of this is that the MacDonald cabinet has been able to implement a just and steady policy as a national coalition cabinet. The national revenue and expenditure for the fiscal year 1933-34 had a surplus of £31.2 million. The estimated revenue for the fiscal year 1934-35 is £700,65.2 million, and the estimated expenditure is £700,57.24 million, leaving a surplus of £796,000. Furthermore, its tariff revenue exceeded the estimate by £17 million, which shows that Britain's foreign trade is indeed showing a tendency to recover. Also, as of the end of March this year, the tonnage of its shipbuilding industry was 161,000 tons more than the tonnage built in the entire previous year (an increase of 45%), which also reflects the improvement of the British financial world, the improvement of trade, and the recovery of industry.</p>
<p>However, this is only the case in general terms. In some major industries, such as the textile industry, it has not yet returned to its original state. Not only is it not easy to recover, but it will also be eroded by others. The one eroding the British textile industry is Japan, a former British ally. Before the World War, Japan's annual export value of textiles was only 43 million yen, but it increased to 360 million yen during the war. Last year, Japan's cotton cloth exports totaled 1 billion yards, while Britain's were only 2.04 billion yards, falling behind Japan. Recalling that before the war, Britain's cotton cloth exports to India alone were 3 billion yards, and to the whole world, there were as many as 7.08 billion yards, one cannot help but feel overwhelmed by the comparison between the past and the present.</p>
<p>Therefore, for its own interests, Britain wants to consolidate its market in Asia. However, it cannot actually fight Japan, so there is talk of a Pacific alliance. Of course, this requires uniting the United States and taking Britain and the United States as the main bodies, while also roping in various countries related to the Pacific. If this move succeeds and Japan does not join, the economic power of the alliance will jointly restrain Japan. If Japan joins, it will be restrained in the conference arena. At the same time, it will also be a prelude to the Second Washington Conference. Although the interests of Britain and the United States are very conflicting, they may cooperate against Japan in their plans for the Far East market. The facts have not yet been materialized, but it has already started with the cotton industry issue. The interests of Britain and Japan are different, and a conflict is inevitable.

<h3>Measures for Rebating Wheat Tax on Wheat Flour Exported Overseas – Ministry of Finance Orders Customs to Comply</h3>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance stated that the export of wheat flour was previously approved in order to promote products and maintain the flour industry. Since the implementation of the import tax on foreign wheat, flour mills have had higher costs due to the tax on raw materials, making it difficult to compete in foreign countries. The Shanghai Flour Mill Trade Association and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Inland Mechanical Flour Mill Association have repeatedly petitioned the Ministry to formulate measures for rebating the wheat tax on wheat flour exported overseas. The Ministry has thoroughly investigated the matter and believes that it is indeed necessary to rebate the wheat tax on wheat flour sold overseas. In particular, it has formulated temporary measures for rebating the import tax on wheat for exported wheat flour, referring to the precedents of European, American, Japanese, and other countries, and attached three principles. The Ministry has issued a decree to the customs to comply with the procedures and has submitted it to the 155th meeting of the Executive Yuan for approval and record. The principles and temporary measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Principles of the measures: (1) The total amount of the tax rebate shall be limited to the amount of foreign wheat import tax actually paid by the flour mill. (2) The proportion of Chinese and foreign wheat used by manufacturers to produce flour varies. After wheat is made into flour, its form is completely changed, and it is impossible to distinguish between Chinese and foreign wheat. Those who can submit the certificate of wheat import tax payment will be allowed a tax rebate in order to facilitate the execution of the customs. Because Chinese wheat enjoys special preferential treatment, its sales can also be promoted. However, the tax rebate should be reduced by 20% as compensation for the cost of tax rebate procedures. (3) The tax rebate will not be issued in cash, but will be given a "wheat tax payment certificate," which can only be used to offset the wheat import tax.</p>
<p>Temporary Measures: (1) Wheat flour mills that use foreign wheat to produce wheat flour within one year of import and sell it overseas may be refunded the import tax on the raw material wheat. The import tax on wheat is refunded according to the standard of 75 catties of flour per 100 kilograms of raw material wheat. The amount of the tax to be refunded is 80% of the original amount of the tax. (2) When a wheat flour mill requests a refund of the import tax on raw material wheat for wheat flour sold overseas, it shall prepare three copies of the application form, together with detailed evidence of the import tax paid on the raw material wheat, and a formal loading bill issued by the official representative of the export ship or vehicle, and submit them to the customs before reporting the export. (3) The application form for the refund of the raw material wheat import tax for wheat flour exported overseas shall state the following items: (A) Name and address of the wheat flour mill (B) Type, origin, or place of origin, import date, quantity, and name of the ship or vehicle carrying the imported wheat of the raw material wheat (C) Trademark number and quantity of wheat flour exported overseas, export date, name of export ship or vehicle, and loading location. (4) If the imported raw material wheat is not directly purchased by the wheat flour mill, the proof of transfer from the original importer to the wheat flour mill shall be submitted for inspection together. (5) The wheat flour for which a refund of the raw material wheat import tax is requested shall be limited to those reported for export by the original customs of import of the raw material wheat. (6) When the customs approves the refund of the raw material wheat import tax for exported wheat flour, a "wheat tax payment certificate" shall be issued, but it shall be limited to offsetting the wheat import tax. (7) Regarding the application for tax refund, the customs may conduct necessary investigations at the relevant wheat flour mills. (Huatel News Agency)</p>
<h3>Activities of Volunteer Armies in Various Parts of Northeast China – The Volunteer Army's Resistance Against the Enemy Never Ceases – The Undying Spirit of the People Can Be Seen</h3>
<p>Liaoning Correspondence: Since the Japanese army forcibly occupied our Northeast, volunteer armies in various places have risen up to resist Japan. For more than three years, it has never stopped.

<h3>The Price of Copper Coins in Guangdong Falls</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Plans to Formulate Measures and Petition the Government for Relief</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The paper currency of the Provincial Bank has not yet returned to its original value. Although the authorities have repeatedly tried to maintain it, the value of one-dollar silver coins still fluctuates from time to time, and it is now worth only 92% of the cash value. Whether it is small vendors, farmers, merchants, students, or all sectors, they are directly or indirectly affected by it. Unexpectedly, at this time when paper money is discounted, the citizens are suffering another loss. The price of copper coins in the market is also declining day by day. The business community has suffered obstacles, and small vendors who pursue fly-headed profits have suffered even greater losses. Recently, the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce has specifically drafted relief measures and asked the financial authorities to adopt and implement them. The measures were passed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday as follows: (1)</p>
<p>Block all smuggling of copper coins into the country. I have investigated that the copper coin system in our country varies from province to province. Most traitors take advantage of the low price of copper coins in a certain province, or order them from foreign countries at low prices and smuggle them into the country, which causes the price of copper coins in this province to fall day by day. The authorities should strictly investigate and punish smugglers. If a ship enters the port with more than 500 copper coins, it will be confiscated and severely punished to prevent smuggling. (2) Try to maintain the price of copper coins. The low price of copper coins not only causes heavy losses to small vendors, but also harms all industries. I have investigated that the copper coins collected, based on recent calculations, exchange for 29 pieces per dime, while the exchange shops buy them for 1,330 pieces per thousand. That is, every 100 yuan loses more than 1,120 copper coins. Moreover, the depression has permeated the entire city in recent years, and the daily loss of the copper coin price has a great impact. It seems that the government should be asked to find ways to maintain it. (3) Recall and recoin. The patterns of copper coins in our country vary. In recent years, there are still many "Great Qing Copper Coins" circulating in the market. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the Qing Dynasty has been overthrown, and all facilities have been re-established. However, the copper coin system still uses the coins cast by the defunct Qing Dynasty. It seems that the authorities should be asked to recall them and recoin them, setting the price. The government will only have a few more procedures and little loss, while the people will benefit greatly. It is reported that the above measures have been submitted to the government by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for implementation. (8th)</p>

<h3>Three More Bandits Apprehended in the Kidnapping Case in Dongshan, Suzhou</h3>
<p>After the manager of the Yonghe Qianzhuang in Dongshan, Wu County, Zhou Jingqiu, was kidnapped, his family redeemed him for a price of 10,000 yuan after several negotiations. Subsequently, the Sixth Mountain and Water Police Team arrested a suspect. The court is currently investigating. Yesterday, Captain Pei arrested the principals of the case, Xi Jingqing, Zhu Anan, and Wang Yinhe, in Ye Chunjiang's opium den in the town. After being escorted to the district headquarters, they were transferred to the district procuratorate for detention pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Tragic News from the Temple Fair in Taicang</h3>
<p>Since the abolition of the lunar calendar and the New Year, flower drum operas, dragon lantern dances, and temple fairs have been held in various cities and villages in this county, almost every day. The ruling authorities, in order to cater to the public's psychology, have not prohibited them. As a result, the general public of idlers and vagrants have intensified their activities. The 16th, 17th, and 18th were the grand festivals in the city, held day and night. Temples from the surrounding villages joined in, making this a celebration unprecedented in scale. There were hundreds of thousands of spectators, disrupting land and water transportation in the city, causing more harm than good. On the morning of the 16th, a villager from the northern village named A Sheng came to the city by boat to watch the festival. Due to the excessive number of passengers on the boat, he was pushed into the water and disappeared on the spot. The next day, his body was found in the Yantietang between Zhintang and Shuangfeng. The Shuangfeng Public Security Bureau recovered it and submitted it to the county government for examination. At about 4 p.m. on the 17th, Su Qinglin, a resident near the 　bridge in the city, was resting in bed due to fatigue from watching the festival day and night. He smoked a paper cigarette and fell asleep unconsciously. The cigarette butt fell onto the bedding and smoldered. The bed curtains were burned, but he was unaware until his skin was burned and he woke up in pain. By then, the fire had spread to the roof, and the entire family was reduced to ashes, with losses estimated at over 5,000 yuan. The 　fire brigade worked hard to put out the fire, and the neighbors were spared, which was a great stroke of luck.</p>
<h3>Wang Yuxiang Kills His Wife with the Help of a Servant</h3>
<p>Wang Yuxiang, a resident of the east end of Gaoqiao in the city, 　has a nanny named Zhang Su, with whom Yuxiang recently committed adultery. He was discovered by his wife the other day. Knowing that his affair was exposed, Yuxiang had the idea of killing his wife. He immediately grabbed her from the bed, took a pair of sharp scissors, and repeatedly stabbed his wife Zhang. Blood flowed profusely, and she fell to the ground unconscious. Knowing that a major disaster had occurred, the family immediately reported it to the County Public Security Bureau and sent the witnesses to the county government for punishment according to law. The injured Wang Zhang was sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Transportation Exhibition Opens</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Preparatory Committee of the Southeast Transportation Exhibition originally scheduled to hold a provisional meeting in Wuxi yesterday (the 19th). The director of the committee, Shen Qi, was also instructed by the director of the Department of Construction to inspect various highways. It is now learned that Director Shen, Liu Yongnian, director of the Zhenjiang Construction Bureau, and Zhong Jingcheng, magistrate of Yixing County, arrived in Wuxi one after another on the 18th and stayed at the New World Hotel in preparation for attending the meeting. Yesterday morning, Shen Baixian, director of the Department of Construction, also arrived in Wuxi from Zhenjiang and went directly to the county government. After a short rest, he was accompanied by Magistrate Yan and the director of the Construction Bureau to the Zhou Shanbang Xihu Highway Engineering Office for a meeting. Because the number of attendees was insufficient, the meeting had to be postponed to 2 p.m. Director Shen and others then went to Youdu 　to inspect the Xihu section of the Xiyu Road at 10 a.m. The houses in the Zhou Shanbang area of this county at the starting point of the section have been dismantled one after another due to obstructing the route, from the fourth branch road of Guangqin to the railway crossing. The road surface project has been built to the Shiqiaotou area of the tenth district of this county, and a small bridge is being built there, which has also started construction.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Land and Water Causes Injury</h3>
<p>The Zhaimen barge in the seventh district of this county was sailing through the Fangmatan area at about 10 p.m. the other night when it suddenly encountered three bandit boats. There were fifteen or sixteen bandits, each armed with box cannons, single knives, iron bars, flashlights, and other fierce weapons, who jumped onto the barge and looted at will. After more than 　an hour, they escaped with their loot. It is estimated that silver dollars, clothes, and other items worth about 300 yuan were robbed. The Zhenfengsheng rice store in Zhangjingqiao in the district hired a boat the other day to load more than 50 shi of white rice, which was escorted to Wuxi by the owner, Song Hepei. However, when they sailed to the area, the bandits robbed 13 shi of white rice, as well as clothes, etc., causing a loss of more than 100 yuan. Three other barges, including the Yangting barge, were also robbed in the area, with losses ranging from more than 100 yuan to dozens of yuan. Wu Bujin, a villager in the Henglin area on the border of Wuxi and Changzhou, was also robbed at his home the other night. The victims, Wu Bujin and his wife, were stripped of their clothes by the bandits, hung from the beams, and burned on their legs, buttocks, private parts, back, and other places. As a result, they suffered a loss of more than 100 yuan. However, Wu Bujin's injuries are so severe that his life may be in danger, and he has now come to the city for treatment.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Zhajiaqiao</h3>
<p>Shen Dounan, a resident of Zhajiaqiao Town in the tenth district (Beixiaxiang), operates a wood shop. He is financially well-off. The other day in the middle of the night, Shen's maid, A Fa Niangzi, took a candle to catch bedbugs in the tent. Due to a moment of carelessness, she ignited the mosquito net. 　Suddenly, the flames soared and were difficult to extinguish. Seeing that she had caused a disaster, the woman immediately turned around and ran madly downstairs, falling beside the stairs. At this time, the fire was getting stronger. The Shen family was awakened from their dreams and fled in panic, avoiding danger. A certain partner of the shop also rescued A Fa Niangzi, but she was so frightened that she died. After hearing the alarm, the firefighting teams from various sections drove dragons to put out the fire, but it was like a drop in the bucket and did little good. The fire was extinguished after about three hours, burning down six upper and six lower houses, as well as all the raw materials, wood, and miscellaneous items, causing a loss of more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Major Bandit Arrested at Dashutou in Changzhou City</h3>
<p>Since the tragic murder of Yu Canrong and the robbery of a large sum of money in Wuyi City, the county government and the Public Security Bureau have imposed a strict deadline for solving the case. Recently, Ni Gusheng, the leader of the detective team, received a report from an informant that the criminals in the case had sneaked into Changzhou on the night of the 18th. Captain Ni immediately dispatched the entire team of detectives to investigate overnight. In the early morning of the 19th, he successfully captured the major bandit Zhu Zhilin and his accomplices Gao Xida and the bandit women Zhu Mao and Gao Wang at Dashutou. Twenty bullets were found in his trouser waist, and more than 100 yuan in banknotes and fifty or sixty pieces of stolen clothes were found. They were immediately sent to the county for strict interrogation. It is said that they are the murderers of Yu An and have committed many robberies.</p>
<h3>Provisional Meeting of Jiangyin Cocoon Industry Association</h3>
<p>The Cocoon Industry Association of this county held a provisional meeting at the county Chamber of Commerce on the 17th in view of the upcoming cocoon market. More than 30 cocoon firms attended. The chairman, Chen Lan, discussed and resolved important cases: (1) The county magistrate followed the provincial cocoon control measures - three articles are harsh and cumbersome, and there are many obstacles, which are really difficult to implement. The association telegraphed the ministries, commissions, and provincial departments to state the obstacles and requested that they be temporarily suspended. It also annotated each article and submitted them to the higher authorities, asking them to consider the current difficult situation of cocoon merchants based on the facts and make changes accordingly to avoid obstacles. At the same time, it telegraphed cocoon-producing counties to express their unanimous position. (2) It was ordered to change to using the municipal scale, which had already been discussed and decided to implement. Merchants had already been recruited this spring to undertake the matter, and it would be completed soon. However, it was heard that the Wuxi County Association, due to the current low price of silk cocoons, was afraid that villagers would mistakenly think that the price of cocoons was being deliberately suppressed if they changed to using a municipal scale that was smaller than usual, so it reported to the county to temporarily suspend implementation. The situation in this county is not much different from that in Wuxi, so it should follow the example of Wuxi and report to the county to state the matter.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Interest-Free Loan from the Bank Allocated to Build the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall</h3>
<p>Of the construction funds for the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Jiangdu County, 2,000 yuan was allocated from the local fees under the 22nd year budget. The county party headquarters, after the resolution of the eleventh administrative meeting, has now sent a letter to the county urging the allocation because the hall has already started construction. The county government, on the other hand, believes that there are not enough funds in the 22nd year local fees to allocate as requested, and proposed the 22nd administrative meeting, which resolved that the party headquarters and the county government's property office would jointly issue a statement to borrow 2,000 yuan interest-free from the Qianye Association, repaying 1,000 yuan before the end of the 22nd year and clearing the balance by the end of October of the 23rd year. The funds would be allocated separately from the county's request to the Department of Finance under the 22nd and 23rd year local reserve fee items. The requests were submitted to the Department on the 18th for processing.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping and Injury by Bandits in Haimen</h3>
<p>Wang Bangxiang, a villager in Limin Township in the sixth district, is wealthy and has a six-year-old son named Xiao Lang. The other night (the 16th), five bandits suddenly broke into the house, speaking in mixed accents and wielding guns and sharp knives. They twisted Wang and his wife and forced them to hand over their savings. Failing to do so, they kidnapped Xiao Lang. Wang chased after them and called for help, but was shot in the right shoulder and left leg by the bandits and fell to the ground unconscious. He was rescued and resuscitated by his family, but he lost too much blood and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Nantong Department of Communications Takes Over Tonghai Qidong Telephones</h3>
<p>The Department of Communications, believing that the long-distance telephones in Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong counties were infringing on state-owned businesses, strictly ordered the termination of the practice and decided that the department would allocate funds and, on the 19th, have the directors of the Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong telegraph offices jointly take over the management and continue providing telephone service as usual, with fees collected by the department.</p>
<h3>Poor Spring Silkworm Harvest in Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The silkworm harvest in the eastern, southern, and western villages of Xiaoshan is poor this year. Because the weather around Guyu (Grain Rain) was cold, the silkworms' sleeping times varied. In the past four or five days, the weather has been sunny and mild, and the silkworms are in good condition. The early batches have passed the third sleep, and the late batches are about to enter the second sleep. There is no fixed market price for mulberry leaves, which are selling for seven or eight jiao per dan. The Chun Zi brand silkworm seeds in Zhyingquan Township are producing a lot of yellow water, and the villagers have no way to treat them. Fortunately, the guidance in Dingcun Kanshan has been effective, and the problem has been somewhat reduced. The price of cocoons is 30 yuan per dan. At this time of rural bankruptcy, coupled with the reduced silkworm harvest, many people are unable to make a living.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Economic Survey of Guangxi Province (Continued from March 4th)</h3>
<p>— Qian Jiaju</p>
<p>The route I 　set for the survey was as follows: Nanning - Liuzhou - Guilin - Pingle - Fu Hexiang - Pingle - Wuzhou - Yulin - Guixian - Nanning - Longzhou - Nanning - Baise. (Except for the sections from Pingle to Wuzhou and Nanning to Baise, which were by water, the rest were by highway. The route taken by the industry group was roughly the same as ours. Unfortunately, Wu Banning, the leader of the industry group, suddenly fell ill the day before departure, so only our group set off first.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of September 9th, we hired two cars from Nanning directly to Liuzhou. The Yongliu Highway is 675 li long. We set off at 7 a.m. and arrived in Liuzhou at 3 p.m. Such convenient transportation must be attributed to the highway. Liuzhou is located in the center of Guangxi. In the past, there was a proposal to 　establish it as a province, but it was 　abandoned due to the turbulent situation. However, it still retains its importance as a military and economic center of Guangxi. The Guangxi Aviation School, Machinery Factory, Alcohol Factory, and Pilot Zone for Reclamation and Water Conservancy are all located here. Geographically, the Liujiang River flows up to the Honghe River to connect to Guizhou and down the Liujiang River to Xun, Guiping) Wuzhou, giving it a commanding position. To the right, it reaches Guilin Pingle; to the left, it connects Qingyuan Nanning, making it a strategic location for military operations. After arriving in Liuzhou, we stayed at the county government. The county magistrate, Mr. Li Yintang, was very hospitable. The next day, I began to conduct a survey of industry and commerce in Liuzhou. According to the merchants, the commercial market in Liuzhou was very prosperous before the 18th and 19th years of the Republic, but in recent years, the market has been depressed and has fallen sharply. The main reasons for the decline are probably: first, rural bankruptcy and weak purchasing power; and second, a decrease in the number of Guizhou opium transiting through the area, which has affected all businesses. The specific facts about rural bankruptcy and the special status of the special goods industry (opium) in the Guangxi economy will be described in the "Guangxi Economic Survey Report." I won't go into details 　here. I will only talk about the general impressions we got in Liuzhou.</p>
<p>Liuzhou has always been known for its timber. Hence, there is a saying, "Born in Suzhou, raised in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou." This is because Liuzhou coffins are the most famous. However, Liuzhou itself does not produce timber. The timber mainly comes from Guyi and Guzhou in Guizhou and Miaoshan in Rongxian in Guangxi. However, Liuzhou is the export port. Hence, the name "Liuzhou coffin" is particularly well-known. In fact, Liuzhou coffins are short 　and narrow and are not as grand and generous as those used in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Although it has the name "die in Liuzhou," it does not necessarily mean that it is truly "in its place."</p>
<p>On the surface, Liuzhou's new roads and streets are clean and tidy and are second to none 　except for Wuzhou. However, the dilapidated business market and the desolation of rural finance are in sharp contrast to the prosperous streets. Putting aside the fact that there were five pawnshops in Liuzhou in the early years of the Republic, there is not even one now. The reason for the closure of pawnshops is partly due to the impact of paper money and partly due to the fact that rural areas have declined to an extreme degree. We stayed in Liuzhou for a total of eleven days and conducted a relatively detailed survey of various shops, industries, and handicrafts. Almost everything we heard every day was a groan of depression. Especially in the countryside, a teacher from the Fourth Middle School told us that the depletion of rural finance often makes it impossible for farmers to buy a plow. Landlords renting land to tenants first ask if they have cattle. One head of cattle can cultivate 3,000 jin of land (Liuzhou uses jin to calculate the unit of land). They harvest 30 dan of grain. If they rely on manpower, they can only cultivate more than 1,000 jin of land and harvest more than ten dan of grain. The landlord and tenant split the harvest, and the farmer only gets five or six dan, which is not enough to maintain life. Therefore, landlords are always reluctant to rent land to those who do not have plows. This is also one of the reasons for the large amount of wasteland in Liuzhou.</p>
<p>Liuzhou's economic status has been declining like a river in recent years. Shops have closed, the market is depressed, and especially rural finance is 　desolate, which is consistent with the national situation. In recent years, due to the expansion of urban capital and the depletion of the rural economy, people across the country have been shouting the slogan of "returning to the countryside."</p>
<p>However, how to make urban capital flow back to the countryside cannot be solved by "slogans." The Guangxi authorities have been promoting agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy projects in recent years. In terms of rural finance, the Guangxi Bank has been piloting rural lending and establishing civilian lending offices. Liuzhou is a central area for piloting various emerging projects. The agricultural and forestry agencies established include the Guangxi Agricultural 　and Forestry Experiment Station, the Liujiang Forest Reclamation Area, and the Guangxi Pilot Zone for Reclamation and Water Conservancy. The Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station is located in Dalongtan, across the river from Liuzhou, about ten li away from Liuzhou. It was originally called the Liujiang Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station. In July of the 21st year, it was renamed its current name. Its main task is to conduct various trials and experiments on various crops (such as cotton, corn, tobacco, rice, etc.), forests (such as red pine and eucalyptus), fruit trees, and vegetables. The Liujiang Forest Reclamation Area was originally located in Shatang, Liucheng. In April of the 22nd year, it was moved to the opposite bank of Liuzhou. It was formerly called the Liuqing Reclamation Bureau. In the spring of the 18th year, it was merged into the Liuzhou and Qingyuan Afforestation Offices and renamed 　. The main tasks of the Forest Reclamation Area are the issuance of wasteland, investigation of wasteland, and the handling of wasteland and barren mountains in the Pilot Zone for Reclamation and Water Conservancy in terms of reclamation. In terms of forestry, it is nothing more than cultivating seedlings, promoting afforestation, and guiding people's afforestation work. The Liujiang Forest Reclamation Area not only manages the Liucheng Forest Farm but also the Liuzhou, Yishan, and Luorong Forest Farms, which are also under its jurisdiction. Since its establishment, each forest farm has worked hard and its business has developed considerably. According to their report to the Department of Construction, the afforestation area of each forest farm has reached more than 11,900 mu over the years, with a total of 5,726,699 trees planted. We believe that afforestation is particularly important in 　Guangxi, where water conservancy is extremely underdeveloped. The Guangxi Pilot Zone for Reclamation and Water Conservancy is presided over by Wu Tingyang and has the largest scale and remarkable achievements. The district site is located in Shatang, Liuzhou, covering an area of 2,168 square li. Their work is similar to that of the reclamation area but focuses on developing water conservancy. The Pilot Zone has also been handling spring planting porcelain gold loans since the 21st year, lending to farmers who cannot afford to buy seeds. Its purpose is to "circulate rural finance" and "support rural production." What I want to say now is the situation of their loans, as a reference for those who pay attention to rural finance issues.</p>
<p>The area occupied by the Pilot Zone for Reclamation and Water Conservancy includes one city township, five Wei, twenty-seven Tuan, and two hundred and thirty-three villages, with a total of more than 8,600 households and about 42,600 people. Their spring planting fund loans are of an experimental nature in a part of the villages within the Pilot Zone. In the 21st year, it was centered in Shatang, with 52 villages, 614 households, and 28,052 yuan loaned, with an average of 48 yuan loaned per household. In the 22nd year, it was centered in Shatang, Shipu, and Shapu, with 112 villages, 1,101 households, and 41,478 yuan loaned, with an average of about 38 yuan loaned per household. The source of loan funds is the advance collection of the district's regular expenses, and the Guangxi Bank's subsidy in the 22nd year, overdrafting 30,000 yuan as loan funds. There are also regulations for the use of loan funds: (1) Purchase of seeds and fertilizers; (2) Purchase of livestock; (3) Purchase of agricultural implements; (4) Other necessary funds. In addition, loans are not given to those who gamble, smoke opium, or drink alcohol. The interest rate on loans is set at 1% per month, with a maximum term of one year. In addition to movable and immovable property, borrowers with good credit can also borrow if several neighboring families guarantee them. The prescribed procedures and regulations can be said to be complete. In the first year of operation (in the 21st year, more than 95% of the total amount loaned was repaid on time. This achievement is finally difficult)</p>
<p>It is to be treasured.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Northwest Impressions are Extremely Optimistic</h3>
<p>Construction is Easier, Military and Civilian Officials' Hard Work is Admirable</p>
<p>The Northwest Has Reached Stability, Investment Prospects are Promising</p>
<p>Soon to Report to the Capital, No Definite Date for Sichuan Trip</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, a standing member of the National Economic Council, returned from a tour of the Northwest the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at 11 a.m., he met with a group of reporters at the NEC office on West Ahrens Road and gave a written statement detailing his impressions of the trip to the West. He also answered reporters' questions, saying that the Construction Bank Corporation is entirely funded by Chinese capital and will be established soon. The trip to Sichuan is still pending. The following is a record of his remarks.</p>
<h3>Written Statement</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting with reporters, Song gave a written statement, saying, "I inspected the Northwest for the NEC's construction projects. Although it was only a month, I traveled through the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia. The Kekonor Sea (i.e., Qinghai) that I had imagined in the past, I was able to experience and admire in person. Every day, I traveled deep into remote areas by plane, horseback, or vehicle for on-the-spot observation. I visited many places and gained a broad range of impressions."</p>
<h3>Good Impressions</h3>
<p>"The observations I made in the Northwest, in summary, are very optimistic, better than the impressions of the 1932 inspection group. At that time, the Northwest was experiencing years of drought, while in the past two years, the Northwest has had ample rainfall, and the provinces are showing a lively atmosphere. Although there were battles in Ningxia, there were significant direct losses, especially livestock in the countryside. Fortunately, it ended early and did not affect spring plowing."</p>
<h3>Officials and People Endure Hardship</h3>
<p>"What impressed me most was that the military and civilian officials in the Northwest provinces are diligently engaged in local affairs, leading by example, and without the airs of high officials. Their spirit is admirable. Soldiers serve in road and water conservancy projects, enduring hardship and toil, which is especially commendable. Chinese people are often concerned that the Northeast has fallen and the Northwest is also in danger. After arriving in the Northwest, I felt deeply optimistic. This view is not an ignorant optimism, nor is it a dismissive statement that the Northwest has no difficulties, but rather the belief that the Northwest issue is relatively simple."</p>
<h3>National Equality</h3>
<p>Those concerned about the Northwest often see the ethnic groups in the Northwest as a major future problem, causing them secret worry. I personally do not think so. During the Manchu Qing imperial era, a policy of sowing discord was deliberately used to create ethnic issues, allowing them to manipulate the situation and rule the entire country. Over time, this led to the accumulation of errors that became ingrained. Now that the revolution has succeeded and the five ethnic groups are united in a republic, all citizens of the country are given equal opportunities. Past misunderstandings and barriers are instantly eliminated. The lives of farmers in the Northwest are simple. The good harvests of the past two years should have allowed them to rest and recuperate. However, in some areas, due to the system of assigned tax quotas, the people are living in poverty. The local military and political authorities are certainly aware of the harm caused by this system, but they are forced to do it. If given appropriate measures and time, it should be possible to correct and abolish it.</p>
<h3>Chaotic Currency System</h3>
<p>The chaotic currency system in the Northwest provinces is indeed a major financial problem and a major obstacle to production. Fortunately, the amount of paper currency issued by each province is not large, so it should not be difficult to rectify. There is also a need for assistance to industrial, commercial, and economic development. It is hoped that domestic banks will invest and establish more branches to develop agricultural and industrial production. From my observation, the political situation in the Northwest has stabilized, and the prospects for investment seem quite secure.</p>
<h3>Economic Committee Construction</h3>
<p>As for what the Economic Committee is doing in the Northwest provinces, such as water conservancy, roads, sanitation, veterinary medicine, and rural relief, these have generally been decided by the Economic Committee's general meeting. After this inspection, there may be some minor changes needed, which will be submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion. The provincial governments and local leading organizations will certainly do their utmost to assist. The country is currently facing many difficulties, and the Economic Committee is limited by its financial resources. Currently, only two to three million yuan is being used for construction projects in the Northwest. However, I believe that although the amount is small, the effect will be great. This time, the government is adopting a pragmatic approach to construction in the Northwest, not engaging in empty talk, but only seeking real benefits for the people. The people of the Northwest are deeply aware of the government's concern and are working together to achieve this common goal. In this way, one unit of effort may be able to accomplish the work of several. Therefore, I am quite optimistic about the future of construction in the Northwest.</p>
<h3>Silver Company Matters</h3>
<p>Mr. Song then gave a detailed answer to the various questions asked by reporters. He first stated that the organization of the Construction Silver Company is purely a matter of domestic capital, with absolutely no foreign involvement. The total capital is set at ten million yuan, and it is expected to be established soon.</p>
<p>As for the establishment of business relationships with foreign countries after its establishment, this is entirely a business matter and there are no restrictions beforehand. I am tired from the journey and need to rest a little. I have not yet met with Minister of Finance Kong and others. Everything will be discussed in detail with all parties. As for when Dr. Lassiman will be able to return to China, I have not received any telegrams recently and cannot speculate.</p>
<h3>Trip to Sichuan Pending</h3>
<p>Mr. Song also said that he plans to stay in Shanghai to organize the report on his inspection of the Northwest, and then go to Beijing to report the progress to the Standing Committee of the Economic Committee so that construction plans can be gradually implemented. Although the trip to Sichuan is planned, it will be scheduled to depart after the tasks in Beijing are completed. I deeply wish to personally inspect various places in the interior, because seeing is believing. I will eventually go to Sichuan.</p>

<h3>Italian Vessel Cordeaux Suddenly Stopped Coming to China What Caused It? Shanghai Office Has Telegraphed to Inquire</h3>
<p>In addition to the three formal mail vessels, the Italian Postal Ship Company has many cargo vessels in the Far East, one vessel per month, carrying goods from Italy, Germany, and Austria to Shanghai, also stopping at India. Usually the cargo vessels come to Shanghai with artificial silk, printing paper, etc. This time the company's cargo vessel Cordeaux, set sail from Trieste, Italy, fully loaded, originally scheduled to enter the port on the 22nd of this month, and prepare to stop at its dock to unload. Merchants had already arrived at the company to inquire about the import vessel schedule.</p>
<h3>Sudden Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the company received a telegram from the vessel stating that the Cordeaux encountered a certain incident near Haiphong, Annam, and in fact, it was difficult to continue sailing to China. The telegram was simple, and did not explain the reason, only saying that it was terminating the trip to Shanghai due to the incident, and asking them to inform the merchants. After this telegram arrived in Shanghai, the company has cancelled its sailing schedule.</p>
<h3>Urgent Telegram Inquiry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office, because the vessel has import and export cargo relations, and the trip suddenly changed mid-route, there is obviously a special situation. In order to understand the truth, it urgently telegraphed Haiphong and the Italian headquarters yesterday to inquire about the reasons for stopping the trip to China, whether the cargo transported by the vessel to Shanghai would be transshipped from Haiphong, or whether there were other accidents. The truth can only be known after the reply telegram arrives in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Yantai Underwater Cable</p>
<h3>Entirely Recalled Starting Today</h3>
<p>Final Batch of Compensation Already Fully Paid Yesterday</p>
<p>From Now On, Our Country Can Increase Profits by More Than 200,000 Yuan Per Year</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that the lease of the Shanghai-Yantai underwater cable has expired, and the Ministry of Communications has sent personnel to formally take over the cable at 12:00 last night, which will be managed by the Ministry of Communications Telegraph Bureau. From this morning onwards, all communication between Shanghai and various parts of North China will be received and sent by the Telegraph Bureau. From now on, our country can increase profits by more than 200,000 yuan per year. Shenshi News Agency reporters have recorded the details as follows:</p>
<h3>Takeover Situation</h3>
<p>Regarding the takeover procedures, engineer Shen Fuhai had already negotiated with the Great Northern and Eastern Telegraph Companies in advance. Yesterday, he met with engineer Brassen of the Great Northern Telegraph Company and others to count all the machinery used for the cable, which was then taken over by our side. At 12:00 last night, both parties sent personnel to Wusong to have workers cut off the cable head of the Great Northern and Eastern Companies and connect it to the original cable heads of the Ministry of Communications in Yantai and Dagu. All takeover procedures were completed. The final batch of cash owed to the Great Northern Company, amounting to tens of thousands of yuan, was also paid to the company in full yesterday.</p>
<h3>Relocating Cable Room</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Communications Underwater Cable Engineer and the Telegraph Bureau took back the cable last night, the cable room was originally located in Wusong, which was not connected to the main hub of the Telegraph Bureau's original cables, making management inconvenient. There was also a need to improve the cable equipment. Therefore, it was decided to relocate to a suitable location near Zhang Huabang and build a new cable room. Construction will begin today. All the items that were counted yesterday, as well as the cable receiving and transmitting machines still stored at the Great Northern Company, have been scheduled to be transported back to the Telegraph Bureau this morning for installation. The personnel needed for the machines will be allocated by the Telegraph Bureau.</p>
<h3>Increased Revenue</h3>
<p>After the entire cable is taken over, all domestic telegrams, except for the Shanghai-Hong Kong underwater cable, will be received and transmitted by us starting at 1:00 AM today. According to the head of the Chinese Telegraph Service Department of the Telegraph Bureau, the Shanghai-Yantai underwater cable is extremely important in our cable telegraph system. The cable is approximately 700 nautical miles long, equivalent to more than 2,000 Chinese miles. The daily revenue from telegrams passing through the cable is approximately 700 yuan. It is estimated that after the cable is taken back, annual revenue can be increased by more than 200,000 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Standing Committee Member Wang Yansong and 60 Others</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech Chairman Wang Yansong and Master of Ceremonies Li Ruzhang First, the Chairman reported the motive for setting up the Nanshi Office, saying briefly that he was very pleased to meet everyone in Nanshi on the occasion of the inauguration of Director Ke of the Nanshi Office today. The motive for establishing the Nanshi Office of our association has been under consideration for a long time, and was only recently decided. We feel that Nanshi is the birthplace of the city of Shanghai, and there are many opportunities for the business community and various circles to contact the local government. In order to facilitate practical contact with Nanshi's industry and commerce, the Nanshi Office was established. Merchants want to unify their commercial powers, because although Nanshi already has a county chamber of commerce, its powers seem to lack unification, so setting up an office is a more precise measure. At the same time, the issue of personnel selection has also been under consideration for a long time, and it was decided to appoint Ke Ganzhen as the director, because Ke has a close relationship with Nanshi's commerce, his reputation is well-known, and he is courageous in taking on responsibilities. It is hoped that everyone present will cooperate and help each other, and in the future there will be extremely great industrial success, it is said.</p>
<p>Swearing-in Ceremony Finally, the director of the office, Ke Ganzhen, swore an oath, "I swear to sincerely practice the Three Principles of the People, obey the laws of the country, and work hard in my position with loyalty. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. I solemnly swear." Finally, representatives from the Social Bureau delivered speeches, and representatives from various industry associations delivered speeches. The Director's reply speech is not recorded. Photography took place until 1:00 PM, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<h3>Longhua's Conversion to Automatic Telephones Activated Yesterday Old Numbers in the Area All Cancelled Pudong Underwater Cable Repaired Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the completion of the project to convert the Longhua area of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to automatic telephone exchanges, after repeated successful line tests, the exchange was officially opened for telephone calls at 11:00 PM last night. The call methods are the same as those in the North and South cities. The original numbers in the Longhua area were also all cancelled at 11:00 PM last night. The new numbers have been printed in the new telephone directory, and the Telephone Bureau has distributed them to all users. As for the underwater cable connecting Pudong to Nanshi, Zhabei, and Longhua across the river, it was damaged in the middle section by a ship on the 16th, causing obstacles to telephone calls. In order to facilitate telephone calls for users, the Telephone Bureau dispatched many craftsmen to rush the repairs, and it was fully repaired yesterday, it is said.</p>
<h3>German Merchant Warns Tobacco Leaf Association If No Improvement, Will No Longer Buy</h3>
<p>China's tobacco leaf foreign trade has mainly focused on sales to Germany, with the tobacco produced in Huanggang, Hubei and Xinchang, Zhejiang being the most suitable. Recently, German merchants received telegrams from their home country stating that the quality of Chinese tobacco leaf is too poor, and much of it has become moldy after being shipped from China to Germany. They hope that China will quickly improve the quality, otherwise they will definitely not buy it. Yesterday, the merchant specially invited Wu Tingsheng, Chairman of the Chinese Cigarette Association, to invite Ding Zhenbo, a member of the standing committee of the Chinese Tobacco Leaf Association, to a discussion. He showed them a telegram from Berlin, asking the association to find a way to improve the quality. He also said that there are still more than 5,000 bales currently in Berlin (each bale weighing approximately 200 pounds), all of which are moldy and cannot be used to make cigarettes, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<h3>Shenxin Textile Mill Implements Labor-Management Cooperation Workers Reduce Wages Employees Voluntarily Reduce Salaries</h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reporters, in order to understand the current situation of various textile mills, learned from the Shenxin Textile Mill yesterday that the reasons for the recent decline in the mill's business are mainly: (1) dumping of Japanese yarn; (2) decline in social economy; (3) bankruptcy of rural areas; (4) cutting off of sales channels in the four northeastern provinces. Amidst this dumping of foreign goods and bankruptcy of rural areas, Chinese yarn has entered a state of unsalability. The loss of the Northeast has made the Chinese yarn industry even more desperate, and the Shenxin Mill is no exception.</p>
<p>Wages Paid at 90% Shenxin is one of the largest textile mills in the country. There are a total of seven mills in this city, five located in the concessions and two located in the Chinese territory. Each mill has between 3,000 and 4,000 workers, for a total of approximately 30,000 workers in the seven mills. Amidst this pessimistic atmosphere among Chinese yarn manufacturers, the Shenxin mills, in order to remedy business losses, only slightly reduce wages or reduce working hours to overcome the difficulties. Currently, the work in each mill is either five days a week, or six days a week, and some still have day and night shifts. However, since May 1, workers' wages have been calculated at 90% of their previous wages. Workers generally understand the mill's difficulties. Although wage reductions have been implemented, they are still able to work with peace of mind, demonstrating a spirit of labor-management cooperation.</p>
<p>Employees Voluntarily Reduce Salaries Employees of the mill, in order to consider the difficulties of the capitalists and implement the spirit of labor-management cooperation, have agreed to voluntarily reduce their salaries. The method is that those with monthly salaries between 100 and 200 yuan will have their salaries calculated at 80%, those with salaries between 50 and 100 yuan will have their salaries calculated at 90%, and those with salaries below 50 yuan will have their salaries calculated at 95%. This will be implemented starting in June. This salary reduction method was entirely proposed by the employees. In the autumn of the life and death of Chinese textile mills, the mill's employees are uniquely able to take the overall situation into account and overcome difficulties together. This is truly a model for all factories.</p>
<h3>Panchen Lama Arrives in Shanghai the Day After Tomorrow Colorful Arches Built at the South Station Residing at the Diplomatic Building</h3>
<p>The Panchen Lama, who presided over the Kalachakra initiation ceremony in Hangzhou, has now completed it. After resting for two or three days, he is scheduled to leave Hangzhou for Shanghai on the 22nd. The Railway Bureau has prepared a special train for him, consisting of a large passenger car (decorated car), first-class dining car, third-class passenger car, and official car, a total of four cars as one train, carrying approximately 50 people including the Panchen Lama. The Railway Bureau has instructed the Transportation Department to inform the Scheduling Department to have the train stop at the Hangzhou City Station for departure. Shanghai Mayor Wu sent personnel to the Shanghai-Hangzhou South Station yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to contact Stationmaster Zhou to build a colorful arch at the front door of the station and decorate the station platform with colors to express a welcome. The construction of the colorful arch will begin today. It is said that after the Panchen Lama arrives in Shanghai, he does not want to reside in the concessions. The Municipal Government has found the Diplomatic Building on Fenglin Bridge as his residence.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Reschedule Public Banquet for Cai Ning Departing North to Tianjin on the 29th</h3>
<p>Archbishop Cai Ning, the Apostolic Delegate to China, after returning to Shanghai from Beijing, has been responding to the requests of various parishes and friends in the city to hold Masses and prayers in turn. The day before yesterday afternoon, he visited Aurora University on Lupu Road, where he was warmly welcomed by the faculty and students. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, he held a Mass at the small chapel in the residence of Dr. He Lizhong in Baoren Lane, Xinbeimen. Ma Xiangbo, a 95-year-old man, also came to participate.

After breakfast, he blessed the residents of the entire city under the statue of Jesus on the roof. The public banquet from various groups in the city was originally scheduled for tomorrow, but has now been changed to the evening of the 24th. Cai is scheduled to depart north on the 29th of this month. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Masses at Various Parishes Today (the 20th) is Pentecost, one of the four major feasts. Catholic churches around the world have celebrations. Apostolic Delegate to China Archbishop Cai Ning first blessed the parishioners at the Dongjiadu Catholic Church on the day of his arrival in Shanghai, because it is the cathedral of the city. This morning at 8:00 AM, at the invitation of Father Zhang Bailu, the director of the hospital, a solemn High Mass will be held at Dongtang. There are 4,000 parishioners in the parish. Although the church</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>is large, it is inevitably crowded. It is said that a string orchestra and choir will play music during the ceremony, making it quite lively and solemn, it is said. Cai has a stay of ten days in Shanghai. At 7:00 AM on the 21st, he will hold a Mass at the Lupu Road Catholic Church.

Mayor Wu will also hold a tea party at his residence to entertain him. Cai is very grateful for the welcome and hospitality of the Chinese officials and has telegraphed the Vatican to report everything.</p>
<h3>Departing North on the 29th</h3>
<p>On the 27th, Cai will accompany the Shanghai Pilgrimage Group to Sheshan in Songjiang to pay respects to the Holy Mother. The 28th is the Solemnity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, so he will stay in Zhongshan to hold Mass, because the construction of the basilica at the top of the mountain has not been completed, so the ceremony will be held in the open air at the Zhongshan Hall Square to avoid crowding the congregation. In the afternoon, he will go to the Songjiang Station Road St. Joseph's Hospital to bless the newly built Catholic church and hold a dedication ceremony. Because friends in the Tianjin area have sent telegrams urging him to come, he plans to depart north on the 29th. As for inspecting religious affairs along the Yangtze River, it will have to wait for another day, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>

At the conference, it was immediately agreed that each travel business would automatically collect donations. Currently, each travel business is enthusiastically collecting these aviation donations.

<h3>International Radio Station Has Not Purchased Equipment or Built Buildings from Germany</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that test calls between the International Radio Station and the UK, France, Germany, and the Philippines have come to an end, and the results have been reported to the Ministry of Communications for review. It was previously reported that a station building would be constructed in Zhabei and that new equipment had been ordered from Germany for official phone calls. According to a reporter who inquired at the International Telegraph Administration yesterday, the equipment purchase and building construction is not accurate. The radio station used the Marconi wireless equipment of the Sino-British Telegraph Administration during the test calls, because the equipment has phone call equipment, which can be used for test calls. However, new equipment still needs to be purchased for official phone calls in the future, and the preparation for purchasing equipment and phone calls can only proceed after receiving an order from the Ministry, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Municipality Levies Fruit Tooth Tax, Fruit Industry Representatives Petition to Return to Shanghai: Discussing How This Tax is a Disguised Likin and Should Be Abolished</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Municipal Finance Bureau's levy of a "fruit tooth tax" is impacting the shipment and sale of fruits from this city. Representatives of the fruit industry in this city, including Cai Run-shen, went to Beijing to petition various agencies to abolish it. Cai and others have now returned to Shanghai after completing their mission. According to their discussion with a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, the tooth tax should be extracted from the commission of the tooth license holders and brokers. The nature of the Tianjin tooth tax is that there is no buying or selling behavior, which is quite similar to a disguised likin. Therefore, the tax bill issued by the Tianjin Fresh Goods Tooth Tax Collection Office states that the bureaus and checkpoints along the way should inspect the cargo manifest to ensure it matches, and immediately stamp and release it, without causing any difficulty or obstruction. If there are any issues such as hidden excess or discrepancies in the cargo manifest, they should be detained and severely punished. This tax bill is completely the same as those used by various tax checkpoints during the likin era. Why is it called a tooth tax? When the Shanghai representatives went to Tianjin last time, they visited Zhang Zhi-cheng, the director of the Finance Bureau, who said that the Tianjin tooth tax name only existed for charcoal, oil, wax, fur, livestock, chicken, duck eggs, and fresh goods, all of which were handled according to old bad practices. If they are bad practices, they should be abolished. How can they be allowed to continue to be used to harm merchants? Moreover, since Tianjin illegally levied this tooth tax, Chinese merchants, whether selling or purchasing retail, are subject to extortion and fines. However, Japanese merchants are allowed to use a bookkeeping method. The Tianjin Municipal Government and the Japanese Consul have jointly formulated three Zeng laws. As a result, Japanese merchants find it convenient to transport goods, while Chinese merchants face difficulties everywhere. No wonder Tianjin fruits are gradually becoming a symbol of inferior goods being dumped. Now, representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Lu Changwei Wen-shao, and others, went to Beijing to explain the details to various agencies and petition for its abolition. All agencies have expressed their acceptance or have considerable solutions, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Explains the Landlord's Refund of Rent Issue: Subtenants Should Be Treated the Same as Sublessors</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's instruction states, "The Regulations on Housing Leases in this city have been implemented. Now, citizen Jin Wen-kui has submitted a report regarding Article 12 of the same regulations, which stipulates 'the landlord should refund three months' rent.'</p>
<p>It is requested to interpret whether the subtenant should fulfill this obligation to the sublessor, as there is no explicit provision in the regulations. The bureau has forwarded the situation to the Municipal Government for review. Now, Instruction No. 10203 has been received, stating, 'The report is noted. The points raised by the citizen are explained separately below: (1) Regarding whether the sublessor should be treated the same as the subtenant in refunding three months' rent, although Article 12 does not explicitly stipulate it, according to Article 11, if the subtenant receives a notice from the landlord to demolish the house, they should immediately notify the sublessor and be similarly exempt from rent. Therefore, if the landlord takes back the house for their own use or changes the property rights and asks the tenants to move out, and refunds three months' rent, unless there is a special agreement, it should follow Article 11. The subtenant should immediately inform the sublessor and similarly refund three months' rent. (2) Based on the above, since the sublessor is also entitled to a refund of three months' rent, the rent for May naturally does not need to be paid. (3) If the sublessor is certain that the landlord has sold the house and agreed to refund three months' rent, they should immediately request the subtenant to do the same, and the concern will naturally not arise. (4) Regarding the amount of rent, it should be noted in the rent book, as stipulated in Articles 2 and 3. If the amount of rent changes, it should be reported to the police district in charge to correct the rent amount in the rent book, as also stipulated in Article 8. If both the landlord and the tenant faithfully comply, the subtenant will have no way to rely on increasing the rent, and there will be no need for relief.' The report is in line with the facts and should be instructed to comply. This instruction, etc. is hereby issued, and in addition to the instructions and public orders, the director of the office should comply. This instruction, May 19, 23rd year of the Republic of China, Director Wen Hong-en."</p>
<h3>The Rent Reduction Committee Commends Two Landlords for Voluntarily Reducing Rent</h3>
<p>The Rent Reduction Committee of this city, according to a report from the Jiangwan District Committee, landlord Zhou Xing-sheng voluntarily reduced rent. According to a report from the Thirtieth District Branch, the landlord of Ren'an Lane voluntarily reduced rent. Yesterday, letters were sent separately to commend them. The letter stated, "Dear Sir, times are difficult, and landlords and tenants should help each other in the same boat. With the surplus of construction, many houses are built but closed. Our organization and other groups have called for rent reduction, not only for the one-sided benefit of the tenants, but also to avoid the loss of mutual dependence and to achieve coexistence and common prosperity. Your deep understanding of the overall situation and voluntary rent reduction is truly a demonstration of a wise person recognizing the times. It is not an exaggeration. It is expected that with one call, everyone will follow suit, jointly reverse the trend, and strive for recovery. Your office has made a significant contribution to this effort. With admiration, we express our sincere appreciation."</p>

<p>In advance, the shipyard built a rectangular wooden platform approximately 40 feet long and 20 feet wide. It was surrounded by flags of all nations. The Shuxing and Chaxing patrol ships were placed side by side on wooden frames. Attendees included Chen Zao-fan, deputy director of the shipyard, Ye Zaifu, director of the shipbuilding department, Yu Jianfu, director of the business department, Xun Ying, head of the materials department, Ye Fangzhe, head of the statistics department, Weng Zuguan of the secretariat, representatives from the Jianghai Customs, and naval personnel, totaling more than one hundred people.</p>
<h3>Launching Situation</h3>
<p>The launching time was scheduled for 4:00 PM and 4:30 PM due to tidal conditions. Because it was during a time of national crisis, the bottle-throwing ceremony was canceled. When the tide was high, the Shuxing patrol ship was launched first at 4:00 PM, sliding from the wooden frame into the Huangpu River. After completion, at 4:30 PM, the Chaxing patrol ship was also launched in the same manner. Two small tugboats dispatched by the shipyard towed the two ships to the shipyard's dock for mooring. After three-quarters of an hour, the process was completed, and the attending guests began to disperse.</p>
<h3>Successive Completion</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the shipyard, the two patrol ships are of the same design, measuring 143 feet in length, 33 feet in width, and 12 feet in depth. The speed is 12 nautical miles per hour, with a displacement of 600 tons and one oil engine. After the launch this time, they can be completed next month. The Customs has ordered several patrol ships from this shipyard. The Dexing, Lianxing, and Hexing ships have been completed. The Haiping and Haihui ships have also been delivered to Customs for use. The Haicheng, Haiqing, Haian, Haiyan, Wenxing, and Yunxing ships will also be completed one after another soon.</p>
<h3>Shareholders' Meeting of the Sze Hai Insurance Company: Chairman Smith Reports</h3>
<p>The Sze Hai Insurance Company, located at No. 17 Bund, is the largest British-owned insurance company with experienced and knowledgeable executives. Its business is thriving. Yesterday, the company convened its annual shareholders' meeting at its premises. The shareholders attended enthusiastically. Chairman Smith reported on various accounts and business conditions as follows: "These accounts were sent to you for review a few days ago. I will now, as usual, give you a brief report. In 1933, general commerce in the East and other places was clearly affected by the recession. The insurance industry was no exception. However, all departments of our company had good results and considerable progress. 1933 was not an appropriate time to seek a sharp increase in premium income. During this period, most companies reported a decline in income. Forcing progress at this time may increase the company's loss rate. The following are the comparative figures for fire, marine, and accident insurance between 1932 and 1933, which show the outline of the progress of each department:</p>
<p>|               | 1932             | 1933             |</p>
<p>|---------------|------------------|------------------|</p>
<p>| Gross Premium  | 1,919,600.30 Yuan | 2,160,393.01 Yuan |</p>
<p>| Net Premium    | 854,798.05 Yuan  | 895,186.80 Yuan  |</p>
<p>| Net Loss to Company | 418,685.25 Yuan  | 422,212.24 Yuan  |</p>
<p>In 1933, the total fire insurance premium income was 1,098,922.60 Yuan. After deducting the reinsurance premium of 743,559.23 Yuan, the net premium was 355,363.37 Yuan. The net indemnity was 120,456.08 Yuan, the commission paid was 68,571.31 Yuan, and the expenses were 51,301.75 Yuan. The marine insurance premium income was 308,183.29 Yuan. After deducting the reinsurance premium of 164,197.01 Yuan, the net premium was 143,986.28 Yuan. The net indemnity was 89,655.73 Yuan, the commission paid was 17,872.14 Yuan, and the expenses were 21,600.19 Yuan. The accident insurance premium income was 753,287.12 Yuan. After deducting the reinsurance premium of 357,449.97 Yuan, the net premium was 395,837.15 Yuan. The net claim was 212,101.43 Yuan, the commission paid was 119,413.03 Yuan, and the expenses were 23,223.24 Yuan. The average ratio of premium income to losses in these three departments is 50.01%. The amounts of commission and expenses are very low, only accounting for 2.99% and 10.73% of the premium respectively. The organizational expenses of the company during this period of development are very low. This may be because most of the company's management fees are paid from the net profits. The insurance reserve has increased from 363,623.27 Yuan to 394,326.14 Yuan. The following is a comparison of the profits from each account in 1932 and 1933: In 1932, the profit in the fire insurance income account was 67.86 Yuan. The profit in 1933 was 67,114.23 Yuan. In 1932, the profit of marine insurance was 19,135.34 Yuan. The profit in 1933 was 27,234.60 Yuan. In 1932, the profit in the accident insurance account was only 2,171.00 Yuan. The profit from the accident insurance account in 1933 has reached 25,692.73 Yuan. Therefore, judging from the annual settlement of these three departments, the profit of 120,041.56 Yuan in 1933 is much higher than the 21,374.17 Yuan in 1932. This is all the result of making sufficient preparations for outstanding liabilities and all other accidents. The life insurance department has made good progress. Unlike other departments, the life insurance department cannot be demonstrated by annual profits. It can only be demonstrated by the accumulation of effective insurance. This effective insurance is the source of profits from future renewal premiums. In other words, the future benefits of this department will be derived from the foundation laid today. The total amount of new life insurance issued in 1933 was 5,396,870.00 Yuan, compared to 2,400,799.00 Yuan or 3,357,760 Yuan in 1932. After deducting expirations, cancellations, and claims, the effective insurance amount has increased from 3,515,076.90 Yuan to 8,027,730 Yuan. The life insurance reserve has increased from 27,493.83 Yuan to 63,055.03 Yuan. Your directors have proposed to set aside 50,000 Yuan from this year's profit to strengthen the reserve. In this way, the surrender value and net insurance capital of our company can compete with any company in the insurance field. As for investment, the interest and dividend income for this year was 242,592.98 Yuan, reaching 5.8% of the company's capital. Last year, this amount was 282,010.24 Yuan, because the interest income of various top-grade securities generally fell last year. In 1932, the loss on the sale of securities was 1,573.43 Yuan, while this year there was a profit of 81,318.54 Yuan. This number includes the sale price of the property listed in the 1932 balance sheet, excluding investment interest. The securities currently owned by the company are all top-grade, diverse, and profitable, and are the best on the market. Their value is increasing daily. Those listed on the exchange are calculated at market price, and those not listed are calculated at cost. Their net profit is all allocated to the reserve item. Total profit, the company's net profit for the year was 415,611.84 Yuan, which has been directly allocated to the general reserve account. The net profit of this year's operation, excluding the fees of directors and auditors, was 378,211.48 Yuan, plus the 22,618.14 Yuan from 1932, the difference was 400,829.62 Yuan. After deducting the manager's commission of 32,821.15 Yuan, the net difference was 368,008.47 Yuan. The Board of Directors recommended the following distribution of this amount: a dividend of 0.30 Yuan per share (180,000.00 Yuan), 50,000.00 Yuan to the life insurance reserve, 112,949.29 Yuan to the general reserve (totaling 500,000 Yuan), and 25,059.18 Yuan carried forward, totaling 368,008.47 Yuan. Directors, since the last shareholders' meeting, Mr. Spyman and Mr. Mayenhou have resigned from the Board of Directors and have been replaced by Sir Zhou Shouchen and Mr. Schogde. It should be requested for ratification. According to the Company Law, Directors Marden, Xu Xin-liu, and Pu Qing can be re-elected, so if re-elected upon the expiration of their terms, they are still willing to serve as directors. Auditors, Accountant Ke Zuo-shi has retired upon the expiration of his term and is still willing to serve as the company's auditor if re-elected.</p>

<p>China Merchants, Jardine Matheson, and Swire Companies</p>
<h3>Jointly Organized Kuling Through-Tickets</h3>
<p>Kuling is a famous summer resort, with its layered rocks, winding valleys, cloud-connected trees, and pleasant climate. During the hot summer months, tourists flock there. However, its location in central China means the journey is relatively long. Although transportation is convenient, travelers must still change between boats, cars, and sedan chairs. Now, the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and Butterfield &amp; Swire, three companies, have, for the convenience of Shanghai and Yangtze River travelers going to Kuling to escape the summer heat, especially proposed the creation of a through-ticket system for boats, cars, and sedan chairs, covering water and land transportation. They have specifically prepared automobiles and mountain sedan chairs to pick up and drop off passengers, and have also arranged for China Travel Service to send special personnel along the way to take care of the travelers, so that they can enjoy the pleasure of sightseeing and avoid the trouble of trivial matters. This is also a new plan for this year. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between Three Companies</h3>
<p>China Merchants, Swire, Jardine, and other Yangtze River steamships total twenty-nine vessels, all of which must pass through Jiujiang upstream. This year, to facilitate passengers from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places going to Jiujiang and Lushan for summer, the three companies have specifically joined forces to cooperate with China Travel Service to create a new chapter in through-tickets for Kuling summer resort travel. After passengers arrive in Jiujiang, the steamship companies will arrange for the necessary cars and sedan chairs, and luggage can even be transported to the mountain, which not only saves trouble and effort but also reduces unnecessary expenses. The cooperation between the three companies has already been agreed upon, and through-tickets will be available for sale immediately.</p>
<h3>Transportation Arrangements Handled Properly</h3>
<p>From Jiujiang to Kuling, one must first go to Lianhua Cave, which is about twenty-four Chinese miles away, requiring the use of automobiles. From Lianhua Cave to Lushan, there are still more than twenty miles, requiring the use of mountain sedan chairs. The cost is very high, and there are various troubles with price increases. Those going to Lushan can visit places such as Nankang, Gutang, Huangjiapo, Five Old Men Peak, Lion Rock, Wu Temple, White Deer Cave, Three叠泉 [Three Superimposed Springs], Taiyi Village, Xiufeng, Hot Springs, Haihui Temple, etc. The transportation for the travelers will not require additional expenses, as the shortest price is included in the through-ticket, and all arrangements are handled very properly.</p>
<h3>Through-Ticket Price List</h3>
<p>The Kuling through-ticket prices for China Merchants, Swire, and Jardine, three companies, have been jointly set, and the prices are determined according to the size and class of the ship cabins, including the cost of steamships, public buses, mountain sedan chairs, etc. The price list is as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai to Lushan</p>
<p>(Company) (First Class A) (First Class B) (Official Cabin) (Steerage)</p>
<p>China Merchants (A) 49.02 yuan 21.8 yuan 14.4 yuan, Same Company (B) 31.01 yuan 18.0 yuan 14.0 yuan</p>
<p>Jardine 55. 40. 20.0 yuan 15.0 yuan</p>
<p>Swire 45. 20.0 yuan 15.0 yuan</p>
<p>Nanjing to Lushan</p>
<p>(Company) (First Class A) (First Class B) (Official Cabin) (Steerage)</p>
<p>China Merchants (A) 37.0 yuan 17.1 yuan 11.6 yuan</p>
<p>Same Company (B) 22.0 yuan 13.6 yuan 11.4 yuan</p>
<p>Jardine 41.0 yuan 29.0 yuan 16.0 yuan 12.5 yuan</p>
<p>Swire 3.0 yuan 15.0 yuan 12.0 yuan</p>
<h3>Liu Yang Impeachment Case</h3>
<h3>Yesterday's Inquiry into Real Estate Fraud: Englishman Ewo Proves Payment of Huge Commissions; Two Checks Found to Have Been Issued by a Woman Named Duan</h3>
<p>Liu Shufan and Yang Jianping, the former directors of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, were both impeached for colluding with others for personal gain during their tenure. One was for establishing a false account in the name of Xunji to operate speculative businesses and trade government bonds with bureau funds, and the other was for embezzling public funds under the guise of purchasing real estate for the bureau. After the fact was discovered, in addition to the impeachment proposed by the Control Yuan, the First Special District Local Court Prosecutor's Office investigated Liu and Yang, as well as those involved, and prosecuted them according to law. The situation of repeated interrogations by the First Special Court has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui held a court session and summoned all defendants and witnesses to continue the investigation of the real estate fraud. According to the testimony of Ewo, the Englishman of Ewo Company, the Savings and Remittance Bureau purchased the real estate on Avenue Joffre and Route Albert through my and Yang Peichang's mediation. I first learned that the owner of the land, Du Yi, wanted to sell the property for between 1.25 million and 1.3 million taels. Because Yang Peichang was also a real estate broker, I asked him if he had a buyer. Later, Yang said that Zhao Baoshan knew someone wanted to buy the land, but he demanded a commission of 100,000 taels after the transaction was completed before announcing the name of the buyer. Yang and I also wanted to jointly receive a commission of 50,000 taels, so I discussed it with Du Yi, and Du Yi agreed that if the transaction was successful, the commission would be approved as requested. Zhao Baoshan then announced that the buyer was the Remittance Bureau. I immediately went to the bureau and visited Director Guo of the business office. After several contacts, the price was set at 1.2 million taels, so I formally sent a letter to the Savings and Remittance Bureau in the name of Ewo, and the bureau signed the letter in response, using it as a sales contract. On the day of delivery, both the buyer and seller came. After the representatives of Ewo Company and the Savings and Remittance Bureau received the title deed, they handed over the checks they brought to Du Yi. There were several checks in total, and I don't remember if there were any promissory notes. However, when the payment was made, Yang Peichang did not come. It was not until a few hours later that Yang arrived, and Du Yi gave Yang one of the checks for 150,000 taels as a commission. Yang then distributed 21,000 taels to me, Yang himself received 29,000 taels, and the remaining 100,000 taels were paid by Yang to Zhao Baoshan. Although we had previously heard news that someone wanted to buy the land, we did not know who the buyer was. If Zhao had not announced the name of the buyer, the transaction would have been difficult to complete, so Du Yi was willing to give Zhao 100,000 taels, he said. Then, a Zhou, a staff member of the deposit department of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, testified. Judge Liu presented two checks from the bank, one for 80,000 taels, issued on October 21st of the 20th year of the Republic, and one for 30,000 taels, issued on December 28th of the same year, and ordered the witness to find out that the account holder of these two checks was a woman named Duan, living on Jing'an Temple Road. The lawyer of the defendant Liu Shufan said that he heard that this Ms. Duan was the sister-in-law of a certain important person's concubine and was an old account holder of the bank. The court then questioned the defendant Zhao Baoshan about the sale of the Yu Garden Road property to the Savings and Remittance Bureau. Zhao still admitted that he received a commission of 25,000 taels for the transaction. Zhao's defense lawyer immediately stated that Zhao Baoshan's allegations had already been defended by the defendant in Yang Jianping's case, and requested that the files be reviewed. In addition, regarding the Daxing Company issue, the evidence was mostly in Hong Kong and Guangdong, and requested that investigations be conducted in those areas. Judge Liu stated that the Yang Jianping case file had been reviewed, and there were still other facts that needed to be investigated, so he ordered that the hearing be adjourned to 2:00 PM next Saturday.</p>

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Dried Goods Industry Urging Sales of Domestic Cold Dishes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Dried Goods Industry Association and the North-South Dried Goods Exchange Association, stating that cold dishes are mostly sold by your associations. In the past, when there were no domestic products, it was understandable to sell foreign goods as a last resort. Now, however, Chinese people have established factories to imitate them, and there are plenty of substitutes to meet market demand. Even in terms of price, although foreign goods have been devalued and sold off at low prices, domestic goods have also been reduced to 2.1 yuan per catty, with little difference. Consumers may not care about such small amounts, and your industry may not be unprofitable. If the selling stores only sell domestic products and refuse to sell foreign goods, consumers, even if they want to take advantage of small profits, will have nowhere to buy them and will reluctantly return. Whether or not the foreign goods' dumping plan succeeds depends on the seller, not the consumer. From the perspective of promoting domestic goods, your association has an unshirkable responsibility. At a time when national crisis is imminent and enemy forces are increasingly evil, members of your association, as citizens, should abide by public agreements and share the common hatred of the enemy. It is essential that your association urge its members to sell domestic products and refuse to sell foreign goods for cold dishes.</p>
<h3>National Goods Mobile Exhibition Group Departs for Northwest Today: Large-Scale Propaganda Planned in Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu to Awaken Chinese People and Prevent Foreign Goods from Entering the Interior</h3>
<p>The National Goods Northwest Mobile Exhibition Group, organized by the Shanghai National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for the Northwest this afternoon. The reporter of the Shen Shi News Agency interviewed Mr. Wang Xingyao, a director of the association, yesterday. According to him, this is the first time that domestic goods have been transported to the interior for exhibition on such a large scale and over such a long distance. In recent years, the Chinese people's focus has been on the Northwest, but the people of the Northwest do not have a sufficient understanding of domestic goods. The association will take this opportunity to conduct widespread propaganda. Currently, Japanese goods have reached Lanzhou, and other foreign goods are rarely transported to the Northwest. If domestic goods can be promoted as soon as possible, it will be sufficient to prevent future troubles. The association previously sent people to investigate before making the decision to hold this mobile exhibition. In addition to the association representatives Xu Jianruo, Zhao Bingren, and Zhou Wenming, there are also representatives from more than twenty Chinese factories in Shanghai, totaling eighty people, carrying more than eight hundred boxes of exhibition goods, worth several million yuan. All excellent domestic products from factories such as Meiya Silk Factory, Hongxin Cloth Factory, Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, China Chemical Industry Society's cosmetics, and other factories have been completely collected. The government has exempted these goods from taxes, and even the transportation costs have been halved by the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai Railways. The round trip will cost several thousand yuan. The exhibition locations are planned to be Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xi'an, and Lanzhou. Each exhibition will last two to three weeks, and the itinerary is scheduled for four months, with Lanzhou as the final destination.

All the goods and eighty members of the group have decided to take the Beijing-Shanghai express train to Beijing at 4:00 PM today. It is reported that the members of the association believe that this trip is of great significance and have specifically decided to gather at the North Station at 3:00 PM to see them off and take a group photo.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Orders City Government to Strictly Prohibit Excavation of Ancient Tombs: City Government Relays Orders to Companies and Bureaus to Comply</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government received an order from the Executive Yuan yesterday, relaying strict prohibitions on the excavation of ancient tombs. It was noted that a telegram from President Dai stated that in recent years, scholars studying Chinese studies and science have suddenly started a trend of excavating ancient tombs to find academic materials. In academic circles, this is often regarded as a matter of course, but patriotic people are heartbroken and cry out in vain. China is extremely poor and its education is extremely corrupt. There are thousands of things that should be done, so why excavate tombs and then learn? People's morals are thin to the extreme. If this heart is not changed, destruction can be expected. The excavation of tombs was strictly prohibited by the Ming Dynasty's penal code, and in ancient times, those who dug up their ancestral tombs were punished by dismemberment. Today, some provinces also impose the death penalty on those who do so. So why are these gentlemen digging up the tombs of ancient people that the entire nation should love and respect, harming the virtue of their ancestors, ruining the behavior of their compatriots, and leaving their descendants with an improper trend? Our Premier Sun Yat-sen advocated nationalism and based it on cultivating people's morals. Our Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, amidst great hardships and exhaustion, knows that the foundation of virtue must be cultivated to save the country. Do the hearts and actions of these experts and gentlemen conform to this path? Those who privately dig up small, nameless tombs of the people are punished with five years of imprisonment, or even execution. However, those who openly excavate tombs, and as a result, greatly add to the prejudice of abandoning national history and destroying the nation, are publicly protected by the power of the state. Is this the way our National Government should take? I beg that you immediately issue an order to the whole country that anyone who openly excavates tombs and takes objects, regardless of the reason, will be strictly dealt with in accordance with the special articles of the criminal law, so as to correct people's hearts and appease people's grievances. At the same time, I urge the gentlemen to change their useless actions, transform their useless hearts, and work hard in the study of saving the country and the people, so as to cultivate the foundation of the country and strengthen its strength, etc. Accordingly, it was handed over to the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of the Interior to review the case. Subsequently, a report on the results of the review stated four items: (1) Academic groups such as the Institute of Geology of the Academia Sinica and the Beiping Research Institute, for the purpose of scientific work, should handle the arrangement of the relics of the ancestors in accordance with Article 8 of the Law on the Preservation of Antiquities when they occasionally touch upon the objects of ancient tombs that have been discovered. (2) Ancient tombs discovered due to natural damage or construction projects should be handled in accordance with Article 7 of the Law on the Preservation of Antiquities. (3) The construction of the Yiguan Government and the establishment of a Central Antiquities Custody Committee should be expedited. (4) Antique dealers and local ruffians in various places who steal tombs under false pretenses should be ordered to be punished according to law by the provinces and cities. After the results of the first 157th meeting of this hospital were submitted, the second and fourth items, which were passed through 124, were handed over to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Education. In addition to the fact that the first item has been ordered to be transferred to the Ministry of Education and the third item has been notified by the Secretariat to convene a meeting for review and telegraphed back to President Dai, the second and fourth items should be followed by the provincial and municipal governments. It is ordered to comply with this order. The City Government has transferred orders to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to comply.</p>
<h3>Arbitrary Hunting Prohibited Within the City Limits: Foreigners and Citizens Alike Must Comply; Municipal Public Security Bureau Issues Notice Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Ge Suizhi, Director of the Postal Bureau's Goods and Payments Department, Embezzlement Case: Hakka Store Has Provided Evidence; Still Released on Original Bail Pending Trial</h3>
<p>Ge Suizhi, a native of Ningbo, the director of the Postal Bureau's Receiving and Dispatching Goods and Payments Department of North Sichuan Road General Post Office, was suspected of altering the amount of fees for goods sent by the Hakka store to various ports and embezzling funds from June of last year to April of this year. After the case was discovered, it was found that he handled 5,000 yuan of printed matter, stamps, and silver dollars every day, with a shortage of 153 yuan and some change, and that on the card of goods sent by Wang Hengchang Silk Store, No. 6 Guangdong Road, Hakka store to Kaifeng, the words "13 yuan and 3 jiao" were altered to "400 yuan." In addition, ten cards of various customers were kept, and the amounts were altered. The Hongkou Police Station was notified, and Detective Zhu Jihuang secretly went to the bureau on the 10th of this month, arrested him, and sent him to the First Special District Court. He denied the charges and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him, requesting bail. It was ordered that the defendant pay 2,000 yuan as bail, and the case would be verified. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefei came to the Third Criminal Court to continue the trial. The defendant was released on the original bail and arrived on time. The lawyer of the Public Works Department, Wang Yaotang, stated that during the adjournment, Chinese and Western detectives investigated the various customers, and most of them said that the amounts on the cards had not been altered. A few said that they did not understand Western writing and had been slightly altered, or that the defendant had done it, but it could not be determined whether the defendant's handwriting matched the altered numbers on the cards. Now, there is a representative from Wang Hengchang to testify that the original amount of 13 yuan and 2 jiao to Kaifeng was altered to 4 yuan by the defendant. According to Shen Xisan, a clerk of the store, the defendant ordered Wu Mingshan, a colleague who had resigned, to make the alteration. Later, the defendant arrived and informed them that if someone from the bureau came to investigate, they should admit that Wu had made the alteration. Furthermore, Tao, the deputy postal director of the General Post Office, testified that from June of last year to April of this year, the defendant did change the amounts on the cards from small to large to deceive the accountants. After the case was discovered, he begged the two accountants, Ge and Zhang, for leniency. The defendant's behavior was very improper, he said. When questioned, Ge Suizhi's testimony was ambiguous. Judge Xiao ordered that he remain on the original bail and adjourned the case for verification.</p>
<h3>The Small Leopard in the Municipal Zoo Escapes: Fortunately, It Immediately Returns to the Cage; Construction Seems to Lack Solidity</h3>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road received a small leopard from the Lü Xintai bird shop in the Temple of the City God, intending to transport it to the National Museum of Natural History in Beiping for display. Unexpectedly, at about 9:00 AM yesterday, the zoo transferred the small leopard from the iron cage into the specially built large animal shed. After it was released, the leopard, due to its wild nature, ran and jumped in the large animal shed, and then jumped onto the water-soaked platform on the top of the small shed inside the shed. From the platform, it jumped to the top of the large animal shed (because the iron fence on the top of the shed was slightly thinner than the front).</p>
<p>The leopard then, in an instant, broke the lead wire from the gap in the iron fence of the shed and escaped, lying on the top of the large animal shed. The zoo staff then instructed the zoo police to fire a gun to prevent it from falling to the ground. As soon as the leopard heard the gunshot, it immediately returned to the shed from the top of the shed. In total, from the time it escaped to the time it returned to the shed, it was less than five or six minutes, which was a great blessing in misfortune. According to the zoo staff, they were very careful when transferring the leopard this time, but the leopard actually broke out from the top of the specially built large animal shed, which was completely unexpected. Although no one was injured, they expressed their apologies to the tourists who were frightened at the time. It has been found that the zoo previously had a black bear break out, and now a small leopard has escaped. The construction of the animal shed seems to lack solidity. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>A Young Man Cut into Two Pieces: A New Ghost on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai night express train arrived in Shanghai the night before last. When it passed near Xiaoyangqiao on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei, a young man jumped and lay on the track and was crushed to death by the wheels. Later, the train guard reported to the police station, which sent police to the scene. The deceased was about twenty years old, wearing a blue silk jacket and silk shorts. His clothes were fashionable, and he was probably a fine young man. The injured area was a waist-high section cut into two pieces. The blood and flesh were a mess, which was unbearable to see. It was found that he had no family members, so the local police were ordered to apply to the court, and Prosecutor Li and others were appointed to inspect the scene and ordered the hall to collect the body.</p>

<h3>Stealing Beans and Making Trouble: The Victim Reported to the Farmers' Association to Request a Stop; Workers Disturbing the Peace Sent to Officials for Investigation</h3>
<p>The farmer Ni Rongrong, who lives at No. 281 Liuying Road, Zhabei, had a petty thief stealing broad beans from the broad bean field he planted behind his house the day before yesterday. His mother, Ni Shen, happened to see it and stepped forward to stop him and persuade him not to pick them. Unexpectedly, the petty thief not only refused to listen but also beat Ni Shen. Fortunately, the people next to him persuaded him to stop, and no incident occurred. In the evening, at dusk, when Ni Rongrong's family was already asleep, more than thirty rough men suddenly rushed into his house, making a lot of noise and threatening to punish him, using the theft of broad beans during the day as an excuse. They did not argue with him and then dispersed. When they left, they threatened that they would beat any farmer they saw and would not let them go easily. It was later learned that the large group of rough men were workers from a certain factory. Yesterday, at 12:50 PM, another fifty workers from the factory rushed into Ni Rongrong's courtyard without asking why and threw the picked green vegetables and cauliflower all over the ground, making a mess. They also beat his aunt, Ni Tan. The farmers in the village were panicked and went to the Zhabei District Farmers' Association to request a stop. The association's staff, Zhang Fuxiang, Yu Rongsheng, and Shen Wenbin, received them and said that the workers had not only stolen other people's broad beans but had also deliberately made trouble, which was extremely illegal. If they were not stopped immediately, the future of the farmers' movement would be unthinkable. They would investigate thoroughly to serve as a warning. Please go back and rest assured and do not panic. They immediately called the police to the scene and arrested Zhou Dushou and Zhao Xiufa, the two ringleaders, and sent them to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Domestic Stone Slabs Approved to Enjoy Special Prices for Educational Supplies: Effective from the 20th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways issued an instruction to the two roads, stating that the Longjichang Stone Slab Company had previously submitted a request to charge stone slabs and stone pencils produced by the factory at a five-class rate. At that time, the situation of the factory and whether the products were completely domestic were unknown, so the Pinghan Railway Administration was ordered to investigate and deliberate and report back for verification. According to the bureau's report, the factory is located in Liangxiang County, with a capital of about 10,000 yuan. The stone materials are produced in the mountains west of Liangxiang County, and the annual output of stone slabs is about 30,000 dozen. The number of stone pencils is small. Except for the stone pencils, which have been ordered to be included in the special price of item 39 of the road as educational supplies, since the stone slabs are domestic products and are educational supplies, it seems that they can be approved to enjoy a special price. It is proposed to include all domestic stone slabs in item 39 of the fee. Whether this is feasible, please approve and instruct the implementation. According to this, stone slabs are also a necessary item for elementary schools and are educational tools related to stone pencils. All domestic stone slabs are approved to be included in the special price in accordance with Article 1 of the Regulations on Special Price Reductions for Railway Transportation of Educational Supplies. All roads must publicly handle this. In addition to the instructions and general orders, you must comply with this order and report the date of publication and implementation for record. The bureau's office has followed the order and ordered all stations to implement it from the 20th of this month.</p>

<p>Shenbao Tenth Far Eastern Games Special Issue No. 9</p>
<h3>Executive Committee Meeting Opened Yesterday Morning, Japanese Delegation Proposed Revising the Charter; Special Committee Formed to Discuss with No Results, Discussion Continues This Morning; Manila Has More Rain, Games Competitions Held in the Rain Yesterday; Today's China-Japan Soccer and China-Philippines Basketball Decides the Championship; Last Night Japan Basketball Actually Beat Philippines, Helping Our Country's Opportunity</h3>
<p>The Far Eastern Games Executive Committee meeting opened at 10:00 AM yesterday, lasting one hour. Three proposals from our country were passed, as well as the Philippines' proposal for boxing and Java's proposal for rifle shooting, to be included as formal championships starting from the next Games. Japan, however, openly proposed revising the charter, hoping to promote the entry of the puppet state as a preliminary battle. The meeting decided to form a special committee of one member from each of the three countries to discuss revising the charter. The proposal subcommittee meeting and the special committee meeting continued in the afternoon, but the issue of revising the charter still resulted in a fruitless debate. The meeting will continue this morning. Judging from the situation, revising the charter will be difficult, and Japan's cunning plan will certainly not succeed. As for yesterday's competition, except for the Philippines-Japan tennis and baseball finals, which were postponed to today due to rain, the rest were held in the rain. The basketball game in the evening was moved indoors, resulting in a very unusual outcome.</p>
<p>The Japanese basketball team defeated the Philippines team by a score of 40 to 38, which was unexpected and helped our country's opportunity to win the championship. Currently, both the China and Philippines teams have two wins and one loss, and the situation is equal. Tonight's final will be a spectacle, but it is unknown who will win. In football, the Philippines unexpectedly defeated the Dutch East Indies 3-2. Our country has no hope in the five track and field events. Only Zhang Lingjia got sixth place in the ten-event decathlon, which may not score any points. Considering the abnormal results of yesterday's ball games, we cannot be too optimistic about today's China-Japan soccer final. Because the Japanese team hopes to split the championship, they will do their best to compete. The tennis finals have been repeatedly interrupted by rain. The five groups cannot be completely finished in one day, and it is still unknown how the championship will be decided. Moreover, it must be said that in yesterday's 50-meter swimming final, Chen Qisong of our country originally got fourth place, but because their Toyota player was not selected, Japan believed that the referee had misjudged and protested. The competition committee accepted the appeal and recognized Toyota as third. Chen Qisong of our country was denied recognition. This is tolerable, but what is not tolerable? In this conference, favoritism and misjudgments by the Philippine referees have been seen repeatedly, and there are many side issues and constant disputes, completely losing its status as the host country and only leaving a stain on the conference, which is hateful and regrettable.</p>
<p>Japan Proposes Revising the Charter, China and the Philippines Strongly Reject the Japanese Representatives</p>
<h3>Resolution to Form a Special Committee for Preliminary Discussion; Special Committee Meeting Twice with No Results; Dutch East Indies Representatives Only Attended as Observers Yesterday; Boxing and Rifle Shooting Will Be Formal Championships in the Next Conference</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Manila, 19th by this Newspaper) The Far Eastern Games Executive Committee (standing committee of the General Assembly, first meeting held at the Columbia Club this morning at 10:30 AM. Japan's proposal to amend the articles of association was indeed raised and resolved to be submitted to the Special Committee for discussion. 20th (today) The second meeting in the morning will discuss the results of the Special Committee's discussion. At today's meeting, all the participating representatives took a photo before starting the meeting. The meeting was chaired by Vangas, the second vice chairman, and Irana, the secretary of the Philippine Athletic Association, served as secretary. The participating representatives from the four countries are as follows:</p>
<p>China: Shen Siliang, Hao Gengsheng, Ma John,</p>
<p>Japan: Abe Hidetaro, Matsuzawa Kazutsuru, Iwahara Taku</p>
<p>Philippines: Alas, Sison, Bogamino,</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies: Brandt, Krasin, Du Beiga,</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Attending as Observers</h3>
<p>After Abe opened the meeting, Vangas first explained that the president of the conference, Quezon, was unable to attend due to illness, and Wang Zhengting, the first vice president, ordered him to temporarily act as chairman, and thanked the countries for coming to the Philippines to participate, so that the conference could be successful. The Philippine Athletic Association was unable to hold the conference in good weather, resulting in the postponement of the competition, which he deeply regretted. Then, Dr. Brandt, the representative of the Dutch East Indies, explained that he was attending with the qualification of an observer and was not a formal representative. Therefore, only three countries participated in the conference. The representatives of the Dutch East Indies must leave the Philippines and return to Java tonight.</p>
<h3>Retroactive Approval of Resolutions</h3>
<p>After the chairman reported and passed the minutes of the standing committee meeting held in Shanghai, Savilla reported the list of awards from the Awards Committee, and the chairman designated the three representatives, Shen Siliang, Abe, and Savilla, to review it. Irana indicated that the resolutions passed between the previous conference and this conference should be retroactively approved first, namely (1) Abolish the overall championship, (2) Change the number of basketball team members from 10 to 12, and football from 15 to 17, (3) Women's tennis is changed to a formal championship, (4) New member states must be approved by all old members before they can participate, (5) The Dutch East Indies and French Annam are approved as new member states in full. After the passage, the discussion of the proposals of each country began, in the order of English letters, first discussing the Chinese proposals.</p>
<h3>Three Proposals from Our Country Passed: Expansion of Athletics and Swimming Qualifying Spots; Fifth and Sixth Place Not Scored, But Included in Records</h3>
<p>China's proposal (1) stipulated the general procedures of the conference. Shen Siliang explained that this proposal advocated that no competition should be held immediately after the opening ceremony on the opening day, as it would exhaust the athletes too much. It was resolved to hand it over to the next conference's competition committee for consideration. (2) The official interpretation of the conference's constitution; (3) The official recognition of winners in track and field and swimming events: both proposals passed. The proposals advocated expanding the number of qualified athletes from four to six, but the scoring method remained the same: only the first, second, third, and fourth places would be scored, while the fifth and sixth places would only be included in the records.</p>
<h3>Japan's Proposal to Amend the Conference Constitution: Referred to a Special Committee for Preliminary Discussion; Our Committee Member in the Special Committee is Hao Gengsheng</h3>
<p>Next, the discussion focused on Japan's proposals. (1) To amend Article 3, the final paragraph, of the Conference Constitution, to be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of the Conference Constitution. The text of the final paragraph of Article 3 stated that the participation of new member states must be approved by all existing member states. Article 9 stipulates that resolutions of the General Assembly shall be decided as passed upon approval by a majority of the quorum. The presence of only one representative from a member state shall also be considered valid, unless otherwise stipulated in the Conference Constitution (i.e., the participation of new member states). The Chairman designated this proposal to amend the Conference Constitution to a special committee for preliminary discussion, and to report the results of the discussion to the second meeting tomorrow. The special committee designated Chinese representative Hao Gengsheng, Japanese Abe, Filipino Alas. (2) To abolish the overall championship trophy of the conference, and to hand over the Japanese Emperor's Cup to the Japan Sports Association for handling. It was resolved to hand it over to the special awards committee for discussion. (3) To propose that the 11th Far Eastern Games be held in Tokyo. (4) When the annual meeting of the Far Eastern Games representatives is held next year, the management methods of various competitions must be decided. Proposals (3) and (4) can only be discussed after the special committee on amending the constitution makes a decision. (5) Japan raised various technical issues in the competitions, which were all assigned to a special subcommittee for review. The list of our country's committee members is as follows:</p>
<p>Athletics: Ma Yuehan; Swimming: Gao Xiwei; Basketball: Dong Shouyi; Volleyball: Xu Minhui; Football: Huang Jiajun; Tennis: Zhang Zizhen. All committees will meet this afternoon and report to the conference tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Boxing Competition Changed to Championship; Proposed and Passed by Philippines and Dutch East Indies; Water Polo Referred to Committee for Discussion</h3>
<p>The Philippines proposed: (1) To advocate that boxing be changed to a formal championship. The resolution passed. There are other proposals that must be discussed after the various committees make a decision.</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies proposed: (1) To change the shooting competition to a formal championship. The resolution passed. (2) To change water polo to a formal championship. The resolution was resolved to be referred to the committee for discussion.</p>

<h3>Special Committee for Amending the Constitution Holds Meeting; Hao Gengsheng Attends with Overseas Chinese Compatriot Attorney Gao Zuchuan; Two Meetings End Without Results After My Country's Strong Rebuttals</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Manila, this newspaper, 19th) The special committee for amending the constitution held a meeting at 1:00 PM today. Our country's representative, Hao Gengsheng, attended with the renowned lawyer Dr. Gao Zuchuan, a Filipino overseas Chinese compatriot. (Central News Agency Manila Dispatch, 19th) The special committee on the constitution of the Far Eastern Athletic Association met at the office of Yila Lan at 1:00 PM on the 19th. Hao Gengsheng from China, Abe from Japan, and Chairman Alas from the Philippines attended. Alas announced the opening of the meeting. Hao Gengsheng spoke first, saying that since Japan proposed amending the constitution, he wished to know their opinions first. Abe said that sports should be universal, so he wanted everyone to participate. Hao said that the Far Eastern Games have a special glorious history. For more than twenty years, the three countries have maintained excellent friendship. In 1930, they unanimously agreed to add Article 3. Why is it necessary to amend it now? Our side fundamentally opposes bringing it up for discussion, and hopes that the Japanese side will continue to cooperate with the spirit of the past. Abe was silent for a long time, and said that it could be discussed from the constitution itself. The Japanese side believes that the constitution is not unamendable. Hao said that amending the general constitution is of course permissible, but the appendix to the constitution is amended with the consent of two-thirds according to the constitution. Article 3 states that the accession of new members requires the unanimous approval of all, which shows that Article 3 has a special spirit. If this article can also be amended, then why was this article stipulated in the first place? From the constitution itself, this article cannot be amended either. Alas said that he hoped everyone would discuss it with an open mind, and then asked Abe, saying that the Japanese side proposed that Article 3 be changed to allow new members to join with the approval of two-thirds of the members present. If there are five members and three members are present, the meeting can be held. Then, if two members agree, new members can join, which is too lenient. Abe said that the procedures for new members to join should be as simple as possible. Hao said that if the spirit is consistent, the procedures, although cumbersome, are also simple. If they are not consistent, the procedures, although simple, are actually complicated. After a long debate, they adjourned at 2:30 PM because everyone had things to do, and would reopen at 9:00 PM in the evening. In terms of emotion and the constitution itself, we have the upper hand. At 9:00 PM in the afternoon, the meeting continued at the Columbia Club. Hao Gengsheng, Abe, and Alas attended. After a long debate, Abe finally said, "Please China agree to the Japanese proposal." Hao Gengsheng said that after Article 3 was passed, the two members of the Dutch East Indies and Annam had already joined, which shows that there is no problem with the constitution and there is no need to amend it. At 11:30 PM, there was still no result, and it was decided to report to the conference for discussion on the morning of the 20th.</p>

<p>(This newspaper, Manila, 19th) In the first rematch of the China-Philippines basketball game, our team lost to the Philippines by a score of 27 to 37 due to poor cooperation and repeated mistakes. The referees were still Wenceslao and Salvador. The result of the first half was 23-13, with the Philippine team taking the lead. At the beginning of the first half, both sides sent backup troops to the court. The Philippine team was better at cooperation and took the lead with a score of 9-4. After a quarter of an hour, the official lineups of both sides took to the court, and the interest increased due to the better techniques. However, the Philippine team still took the lead. In the second half, the Philippine side's offense became even more fierce, and they ran around like monkeys.</p>
<p>With ten minutes remaining, the Philippines took the lead with a score of 33-20. Our team missed many catchable balls. As a result, the Philippines won 37-27. Wang Yuzeng and Li Zhenzhong performed best for our team, while Tang Baokun was disappointing. Cruz and Medina were the mainstays of the Philippine team. Because the competition was too intense, actions went beyond the rules, and it was even worse in the second half. This is inevitable in fiercely competitive games.</p>

<p>In the first inning, the Japanese army attacked first. The first batter first hit a shortstop hit, and immediately stole second base. Due to the catcher's bad throw, he advanced to third base. After Kariyata's grounder, Katada made a hit, flying between first and second base, and Lin Desheng returned, and the Japanese army obtained the first point. Next, Nagai's left-wing hit and Matsui's third-base strong attack allowed Katada to return. After that, they were unable to continue. The Chinese army retired for three. (Japan 2 China 0). In the second inning, both armies did nothing. (Japan 0 China 0).</p>

<h3>Five-Sport Event: Japanese Army Wins Completely</h3>
<p>(Telegraphic Communication Society, Manila, 19th) Although the venue for the five events in the all-around competition was poor due to rain, it was still held.

<p>(Telegraphic Communication Society, Manila, 19th) Today's 1600-meter relay</p>
<p>In the final, Philippine army Estoradar took the lead, and Aihara (Japan) chased closely behind, but failed to catch up, and gradually left, about one meter apart. Then Ichihara sent his feet, and although Ichihara tried his best to chase, the distance could not be shortened. Yoshizumi continued, but Huayte of the Philippine army was very strong and ran like a fly, causing the distance to be three meters. Finally, Masuda abandoned his life and chased hard, and Arambola was almost overtaken. The fierceness of the battle can be imagined. At the end, the Japanese army was only one chest behind, and the Philippine army won.</p>
<p>(Telegraphic Communication Society, Manila, 19th, 1600-meter relay Japan)</p>
<p>Because of the failure in yesterday's 400-meter final, they intended to avenge, so they were very nervous when they took the stage. However, judging from the following records, it can be known that the battle was fierce, so it was difficult to distinguish between them until the end. Only the last runners, Masuda and Arambola, differed by one chest.</p>
<p>Reaching the finish line, the Philippines won as a result.</p>
<p>First place: Philippine team 3 minutes 20 seconds 3 (new conference record)</p>
<p>(1) Estoradar (2) Huayte</p>
<p>(3) Gondari (4) Arambola</p>

<p>(3) Yoshizumi Takeshi (4) Masuda Iso</p>
<p>Both teams broke the conference record of 3 minutes 23 seconds 9</p>
<p>Philippine swimming athlete Yrtai Fangsha</p>
<h3>Maintains the Honor of Being First Four Times; He is the Most Honored of All Sports in the History of the Far Eastern Games; Specializing in Breaststroke Practice, It is Rare to Enjoy This Reputation</h3>
<p>(Japan Allied News Agency, Manila, 19th) Japanese athlete Koike's first place in the 200-meter breaststroke was snatched by Philippine athlete Yrtai Fangsha, which the Japanese people found quite regrettable. Yrtai Fangsha has been specializing in breaststroke practice for a long time, and has maintained the honor of being first four times in a row in the Far Eastern Games, which is admirable. Tsuruta, who won the World Games, was defeated by him at the last conference in Tokyo, and now Koike, a world-class athlete, has also been defeated. The progress of Japanese swimming has almost occupied the world's throne, but at the same time, there are such strong athletes in other countries. This competition is a valuable competition for Japanese athletes to realize this.</p>

<h3>Japan Loses in Boxing</h3>
<p>Luzon Wins 3-1</p>
<p>(Manila Electric Communication, 19th) The boxing competition between Luzon and Japan was held at the tennis court at night. The results of the three matches were as follows. Although the final light heavyweight match between Saito and Garnos Batra was judged a loss for Saito, Saito consistently demonstrated an advantage. Everyone believed Saito won without a doubt. Even foreign reporters acknowledged that the refereeing by Lev was a misjudgment. Therefore, the audience was displeased, causing a commotion.

<h3>Shameful Conduct of Philippine Referees: Unprecedented Number of Misjudgments</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Manila, 19th. The 10th Far Eastern Olympic Games are only two days away from completion. The disorganization of the organizing committee of the Philippines, the host country, over the past seven days of competition has been truly astonishing. For example, the second China-Japan baseball match, which was already announced as postponed on the 18th, and the second China-Philippines volleyball match were suddenly announced to be held again. The triple jump in track and field was delayed by two hours before it could finally take place, and the pole vault was similarly delayed. Finals such as the 224 were held in the dark of night. Many such incidents have dampened the spirits of the athletes. Furthermore, there have been countless instances of unfair refereeing and misjudgments. There have been many misjudgments related to China, such as in basketball, leading to disputes. As for incidents related to Japan: (1) In the 50-meter freestyle preliminary, Takahashi, who was actually second in Group A, was judged fourth, and Umeya, who was actually third in Group B, was judged to be eliminated. (2) After the high hurdles preliminary, it was announced that the athlete Every had been eliminated and Shimizu had been selected. Due to protests from the Philippine delegation, it was announced again that Shimizu had been eliminated. (3) In the 100-meter final in track and field, there were two false starts at the beginning. On the third start, the Philippine athlete still started incorrectly, but the starter did not stop him and allowed him to run. (4) In the 500-meter final in swimming, Toyota's second-place finish was missed. Japanese officials protested strongly. (5) In boxing, Saito Shigemi should have won, but he was judged to have lost. Mistakes continued to occur, causing participating athletes to be very angry, leading some to doubt whether the Philippines was qualified to be the host country.</p>
<h3>Second Day of the Secondary School Sports Meet: Good Results in Various Men's and Women's Track and Field Finals; Important Announcement Issued at Today's Closing Ceremony</h3>

<h3>Primary School Arithmetic Competition Preliminary Round Date Postponed by Two Weeks; District Simultaneous Competition to be Held on the Third of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education yesterday issued an order to municipal and registered primary schools, stating that the preliminary rounds of this year's primary school arithmetic competition should be completed before May 10th, and the selected representatives should be reported to the Bureau to participate in the</p>
<p>semi-finals. The district semi-finals were scheduled to be held simultaneously on May 20th, and orders have been issued for compliance. However, it has been found that many representatives selected for the preliminary rounds by various schools were not able to report on time. As of recently, there are still schools beginning to report. Considering that this competition is an innovation and hoping that students from all schools can participate widely, the Bureau has made an exception and allowed registration to continue. However, the preparation procedures such as compiling student lists and allocating venues have already been rushed. It is necessary to extend the preparation time in order to be thorough. Furthermore,</p>
<p>with the primary school sports meet about to open in the coming days, and the competition period following closely, it is difficult for schools to cope. Therefore, it has been decided to postpone the date of the primary school arithmetic competition semi-finals by two weeks, to June 3rd, and will be held simultaneously by district. Registration for all schools will close immediately. All are hereby ordered to take note. This order.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Practicing the New Life Movement - First and Foremost, Pay Attention to Courtesy -</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Nowadays, most children have a bad habit, which is that they don't have any manners towards anyone, which is really wrong. Because courtesy is very important, of course, we should be polite when we meet teachers, parents, uncles, and aunts, and we should also have considerable manners when we meet peers, classmates, or friends.</p>
<p>If you neglect to be polite when you should be polite, people will say that you are ignorant of manners. Therefore, a person should always be polite at any time and in any place, especially now when the whole country is unanimously advocating a new life.</p>
<p>Dear children, let's pay attention to manners! You must know that paying attention to manners is the first important condition for practicing the new life! Children, pay attention.</p>
<h3>Bravery</h3>
<p>— Ma Ying</p>
<p>This happened five years ago, but I will always remember it.</p>
<p>One spring afternoon, the sun was shining warmly on the ground</p>
<p>, the sky was like a blue sea, with only a few thin white clouds floating. I changed into a long gown and went out because I wanted to find my friend to discuss something. Just as I reached the door of my friend's house, I suddenly saw a seven- or eight-year-old girl playing ball there. I recognized her; she was the second daughter of Mrs. Jin, who lived in the same house as my friend, and her name was Man. That day, she was wearing a light blue free cloth short shirt and</p>
<p>a black silk short skirt, with two short, thick braids hanging in front of her chest. Her hands were patting the ball, and her two braids were swaying. Suddenly, a child ran from the side of the road and snatched her ball away. She couldn't help but be stunned. I thought she would definitely cry, but who knew that not only did she not cry, but she bravely chased after him, grabbed the child, and the two of them wrestled for a while. Finally, Man snatched the ball back. Moreover, the child was beaten to tears by her and dared not come over to snatch her ball again.</p>
<p>Dear children! Look how brave Man is! Now that our country's territory has been snatched away by other countries, we must unite all the children of China and bravely defeat the enemy like Man to take back our territory!</p>
<h3>The Swallows Are Back</h3>
<p>— Chang Shaoying</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting warmer!</p>
<p>The long-lost swallows,</p>
<p>are once again looking for their old nests;</p>
<p>Swallows!</p>
<p>Please tell me—</p>
<p>The sea you floated over,</p>
<p>The roads you traveled,</p>
<p>You have traveled to many places;</p>
<p>Your experiences,</p>
<p>must be numerous;</p>
<p>Now the gentle breeze has awakened it!</p>
<p>Look at it—</p>
<p>Wearing fresh flowers on its head!</p>
<p>Dressed in a green jacket!</p>
<p>When spring speaks,</p>
<p>it is also chirping and singing tunes.</p>
<p>Lovely bees</p>
<p>Lovely bees!</p>
<p>Your luck is really good!</p>
<p>Beautiful and bright stamens,</p>
<p>are all picked by you first;</p>
<p>Sweet and fragrant flower scents,</p>
<p>are all enjoyed by you!</p>
<h3>Children of the Coldest Country in the World</h3>
<p>— Hu Yunwu</p>
<p>In Greenland, the far north of North America, there is a kind of Eskimo people, who are the smallest people in the world. Even adults are just dwarfs about one meter tall. In the ice fields, they cut ice into squares and use it as bricks and tiles. These houses are not fixed and often rely on dogs to pull them to places with slightly less wind and snow. Therefore, there are no fixed villages or streets. Because they live in cold areas, it is not easy to find other food besides hunting. If they capture a large number of animals, such as seals, deer, white foxes, and bears, they have to move the ice house to other places to exchange for things like pots, knives, and cigarette lighters.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is their dogs. At night, they guard outside the ice house, paying attention to whether any wild animals pass by. Sometimes they take their owners to various places to search for the tracks of wild animals. Therefore, Eskimos regard dogs as the guardian gods who protect the lives of their families. The animals they capture are also distributed to and eaten by the dogs. Their children grow up with dogs and regard dogs as good friends. Dogs also do their best to protect children at home. If ferocious beasts such as bears, leopards, and wolves attack, the dogs will desperately rescue the children.</p>
<p>Although they grow up on the ice fields from a young age and have small bodies, their muscles and skin are forged to be very strong, and their chest widths are widely expanded. They struggle with the cold wind and ice and snow all year round and do not feel any pain. The children get up at sunrise. Looking at it this way, we people in temperate zones enjoy the bounty of the natural world's materials, but we are still greedy and insatiable, and we are afraid of the cold and afraid of suffering. Aren't we ashamed to death?</p>
<h3>The Tongue of Animals</h3>
<p>— Yu Bailu</p>
<p>The tongue can be said to be the strangest part of the animal's body. It can be quickly pushed in and pulled out, happily moved from left to right or up and down, and then it can be very freely bent, curled, and straightened.</p>
<p>Children, have you ever paid attention to the shape of the tongue? The thinnest tip gradually thickens towards the middle, and at the middle point, it slopes towards the throat. Although the root of the tongue is fixed at the bottom of the mouth, its tip and edges can move at will, except for wanting to leave the mouth and fall outside.</p>
<p>The tongue is extremely useful to us. Apart from it, although there are other speech organs such as lips, teeth, palate, nose, and throat, it can be said to be the most important. Without it, can you speak clearly and make people understand? Also, when eating, it can help us distinguish tastes, mix saliva with food, and then roll the unchewed food onto the teeth for chewing, and send the chewed food into the throat for swallowing.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of animals that use their tongues as hands. Cows are the easiest to see. When they eat grass, they use their thick tongues to roll the grass into a ball, then hold the top and swallow it into their stomachs. Giraffes eat almost like cows. They use their slender tongues to roll up leafy twigs and then chew the leaves within the range with their teeth. The tongue of a frog is different from that of ordinary animals. Its root is in the front of its mouth, and its tip faces the throat. When it sees a flying insect near its body, it quickly throws its tongue out and sticks the insect to it as food, because its tongue tip has a kind of gelatinous substance on it. Australia has an anteater that has a thin, spiral-shaped tongue. With this tongue, it often goes into ant nests and eats many ants. The tongue of a woodpecker is very rough, because this way it can drag borers out of branches.</p>
<p>The largest tongue in the world belongs to the whale. When it is alive, it is almost fourteen feet long, which is the length of your three bodies added together. Children, do you think that's scary?</p>
<h3>The Use of Cuttlebone</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xinfa</p>
<p>Children! When your family eats cuttlefish meat, they always throw away the bone on its back, which is a pity. In fact, it has many uses. I will write down two of them below:</p>
<p>(1) Take one or two small sticks, insert them into the bone, and then cut paper into the shape of a sail and stick it to the sticks. Put it in the water and let it drift with the wind. It really looks like a sailboat, or you can use your smart brain to make it look like a warship, which is even more fun.</p>
<p>(2) Hide the cuttlebone at home. Once you accidentally cut your skin with a knife and bleed, immediately scrape off the powder and put it on the wound. It can stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>There is also one thing to pay attention to, that is, never use cuttlebone powder as toothpaste to brush your teeth, because its powder particles are very coarse. Although your teeth are brushed white, the enamel on your teeth has been brushed very roughly.</p>
<p>Children's Science Lecture</p>
<h3>Wind</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>Summer is coming soon, and the children are welcoming the arrival of the wind, but where does the wind come from? You wave a paper fan (Figure 1), and it immediately blows softly on your face. You take a paper twist and put it on the mouth of a kerosene lamp cover to try it, and you will feel hot air blowing upwards from inside the lamp cover (Figure 2), and the paper twist dances upwards. This is because the air inside the cover is heated and expands and rises, and the cold air outside the cover rushes in from under the cover. Hot air goes out, and cold air comes in to fill their empty spaces; this flow of air becomes wind. It's like boiling a kettle of water. The water at the bottom of the kettle near the fire heats up first and rises, and the cold water above goes to fill its empty space (Figure 3), which is the same principle. The sun shines on the Earth and heats up first, causing most of the air to heat up and rise, and another part of the air comes over to supplement it, which is the cause of wind.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of wind, generally distinguished according to the magnitude of the force. Ordinary breezes and gales are beneficial to humans and plants. Our daily food, rice and wheat, and other plants such as dandelions, willows, and pines... rely on the power of the wind to transmit pollen for them (Figure 4) to bear fruit. If there is no wind, the large amount of water vapor on the sea will not be blown to the shore, and the amount of rainfall on land will be reduced. Wind can also replace human power, such as sailing sailboats (Figure 5), using wind power to grind flour (Figure 6), and also clean the air and regulate the climate. The work of wind is so great!</p>
<p>Of course, wind is also harmful. Like when a hurricane arises, it overturns boats, collapses houses, uproots trees, and overturns walls (Figure 7). It can also roll seawater onto land, causing major disasters (Figure 8), but these phenomena are ultimately occasional events!</p>
<h3>Bees Among the Flowers, Suzhou Jinghai Elementary School</h3>
<p>— Zhou Rong</p>
<p>Time passes like flowing water. Spring has been gone for many days, and the temperature increases and decreases on the thermometer. Flowers and insects also grow according to the climate.</p>
<p>One day, it felt very hot. I sat on a very quiet bluestone and watched a bee wearing a beautiful yellow dress flying in the air, as if looking for something. It turned out that what it was looking for was a rose.</p>
<p>It searched for a long time before it found it, so it was both surprised and delighted and hurriedly extended a needle-like thing to suck the sweetness from the rose. After sucking this flower, it sucked that flower; it sucked countless flowers in total.</p>
<p>After watching this, I felt that this bee was like Japan invading and occupying our three northeastern provinces. Why? Because its needle is like the Japanese's weapon. They used weapons to occupy our land; just like the bee uses a needle to suck honey!</p>
<h3>Why Read the Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Children: Your father, mother, brother, sister, and even you, don't you all read the newspaper every day; but why read the newspaper? You probably can't answer this question right away, so I'll tell you now;</p>
<p>There were no newspapers in the past - you must find that very strange, but it's true - so the atmosphere was very closed at that time! Only when someone achieved fame and success would a special messenger go to his home to deliver the news report; the families who received this news report had to pay a lot of wine money; but all they knew was that someone in their family had achieved fame and success, and there was no other meaning.</p>
<p>Since there have been newspapers, the newspaper industry has developed day by day; because for a small amount of money, you can know the general trend of the world, the situation of the country, social news, and the articles on the supplements can add a lot of interest. As for our purpose in reading the newspaper, in addition to being able to obtain the various knowledge mentioned above; we can also make reading the newspaper a daily task, and when we see good people or good things reported in the newspaper, we imitate them; when we see bad people or bad things reported, we avoid them; then we have good examples and bad warnings every day, which is the benefit of reading the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Tongue Twister</h3>

<p>Dear children, many tongue twisters have been published in this newspaper, and you have probably all seen them. At the same time, I know that you must be very interested in them, so I now have two tongue twisters to contribute to you. Although these two tongue twisters of mine have very few words, they are very difficult to read, and the faster you read, the more likely you are to pronounce the syllables wrong. Now let me write them down below. Children, you may want to try them.</p>
<p>(1) Sister-in-law burns incense, she wants to burn Xiaoshan incense.</p>
<p>(2) In the red flower bowl, there is a live green frog.</p>

<h3>Ink</h3>
<p>Children; the weather is slowly getting hotter, and your hands often sweat. When grinding ink, when you hold the ink with your hand, your hands will be dyed black by the ink, because your hands are sweaty; if you carelessly touch your face with your ink-stained hands, there will be ink spots on your face; if you touch a book, there will be inky handprints on the book. How annoying that is! What to do? We just need to wrap one end of the ink, - (the end you hold in your hand) - with paper. When grinding ink, hold your hand on the wrapped paper; in this way, even if your hands are sweaty, the ink will not stain your hands; because the paper wrapping the ink has taken effect.</p>
<h3>Inkstone</h3>
<p>Children; if the "bottom of the inkstone" is smooth, and the "tabletop" is also smooth; then when grinding ink, don't forget to put a "soft piece of paper" under the "inkstone;" grinding ink like this will prevent the "inkstone" from moving. Otherwise: when you are grinding ink, the "inkstone"</p>
<p>will move with the "grinding ink." - The reason is: "The bottom of the inkstone" is smooth, and the "tabletop" is also smooth; when grinding ink, because the "ink" vibrates the "inkstone," the "inkstone" moves, and "the bottom of the inkstone" separates and changes from the "tabletop," so the "inkstone" has to move; if a "soft piece of paper" is placed between the two, a connection is made, so the "inkstone" will not move. -</p>
<h3>The Stupid Ostrich</h3>
<p>— Niao Ruoxu</p>
<p>The ostrich, which lives in the tropical desert, can be regarded as the king of birds. It has the physique of a pony, and it has strong legs that can travel dozens of miles in an instant. Almost no bird is stronger than it. But it is easier to catch than a sparrow, because it is very stupid. When it sees a hunter approaching, it does not run away, but only buries its head in the sand, leaving its body squatting on the ground. It thinks that hiding like this will prevent people from seeing it, but who knows that it falls into the hands of the hunter like this! Children, foolish actions often lead to big mistakes. For example, many timid children, because they are afraid of rats or nightmares in the middle of the night, often sleep with their heads covered in the quilt. Just think about how unsanitary this is!</p>

<h3>High Jump in Forward Silver Prices in the Financial Market, Gold Price Drops by Four Dollars and Ninety Cents; Rumors that the US Equalization Fund Has Been Used to Publicly Purchase Silver; Panic Among Bulls on Monday Absence of Market Breaks One Thousand Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market fell due to sudden increases in forward silver prices, unfavorable telegrams about American purchases of silver, and the upcoming Monday's presidential report to Congress on the silver issue. With Monday also being a bank holiday and the gold market closed for the day, a general sense of panic suddenly arose among bulls, leading to an initial break of the one thousand yuan mark. Later, with settlements and exchange rates improving, the market stabilized. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in Britain and America uniformly declined, but forward silver prices in the precious metals exchange rose by varying degrees, from 2.3% to 6.4%. Exchange rate fluctuations were evident. London spot gold rose by one penny, American cotton fell by eight pounds, and American wheat shrank by 0.125. The initial opening price for raw materials was 0.23 yuan. A Reuter's dispatch stated that, according to reliable sources in Washington, the Ministry of Finance's Equalization Exchange Fund of 200,000,000 yuan had recently been used to purchase silver on the open market. In recent weeks, the government had purchased 25,000,000 yuan worth of silver. The opening price immediately broke the 1,000 yuan mark but quickly recovered and stabilized outside that level. Expectations were that HSBC's listed exchange rates for both British and American currency would remain unchanged, which calmed sentiment. Banks had a healthy appetite, and British-American Tobacco made settlements. The gold market gradually rose. Later, with strong supply terms for raw materials, the exchange market gradually stabilized and trended downward. However, news of nighttime silver prices in Seattle rising by 0.125, falling by 0.125, and rising by 0.375 created uncertainty. After entering the market, buying and selling opinions were vague, and the exchange market was quiet. There were many sudden ups and downs, but the market situation remained stable, lacking any special changes. The price of pure gold was 1012.5 yuan, and the swap premium remained at 1 yuan. Here is a record of the morning's market situation: the morning opening price was 999.5 yuan, a sharp drop of 12.2 yuan compared to the previous close. The raw materials opened at the same price. Exchange market opened with recent selling prices of one shilling, three and five six two five pence for British exchange and thirty three yuan one eight seven five for American exchange.</p>
<p>Overseas telegrams were unfavorable, and sentiment was extremely weak, so the market then retreated to 8 yuan. Da Xing, Yong Sheng, Da Fu Xing, Yong Qian, Chang Xiang, Ding Kang, Yuan Mao, and Yong Ju Jin all advanced, rising to 1002.8 yuan. Heng Xing, Shun Mao, and Cui Tai offered terms, lowering it to 0.05 yuan. Later, although Xin Chang, Yuan Mao sold, the domestic market was extremely tight. British-American Tobacco suddenly made a settlement, digging up September American dollars at 6.25. It was then difficult to settle, and Da De Cheng, Yuan Chun, Heng Xing, Yi Feng, Yong Heng, Tai Ying, Feng Heng, Qian Chang Xiang, and others jointly purchased terms, rising to 5.5 yuan. Yong De, Heng Xing, and Zheng Chang unloaded, bringing it to 4.3 yuan. Expectations were that listed exchange rates would not move. Da De Cheng, Fu An, and Qian Chang Xiang continued to advance. HSBC and Sumitomo: August American dollars rose from 4.375 to 6.5. Bing Xing and Da De Cheng unloaded somewhat, falling to 5 yuan. But with the domestic market remaining tight, Fu Yu, Da De Cheng, Chang Sheng, and Yong Zhao Feng Chang advanced again, rising to 7.4 yuan. Raw materials worked hard to sell terms, and Fu Yu, Qian Chang Xiang, Cui Tai, and Heng Xing also supplied each other, resulting in a downstream trend. However, Yi Feng and Yong Fu Tai Heng purchased strongly, and the Central Bank purchased strongly, struggling around 5 yuan. Afterwards, raw materials, Yi Feng, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Qing Fa, and Yong Shen Kang sold terms, and the domestic market loosened, falling to 3.6 yuan. Seattle nighttime silver prices rose 0.125 and fell 0.375, which calmed sentiment, hovering around 4 yuan. Finally, Tian Feng, Run Chang, Yu Da De Cheng advanced, fueling buying, pushing it to 6.3 yuan, and the domestic market remained tight. Raw materials continued to supply, and Yu Qing Yong also sold, gradually falling to within 4 yuan. Heng Bei and Ying Feng Yong still had an appetite, so the market was again pushed to 7.3 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong and Da Cheng sold terms, again falling to 6.1 yuan. The noon closing price was 1006.8 yuan. Raw materials were trading at 5.8 yuan. After the market closed, Zhao Feng Chang, Yong Feng, and raw materials sold slightly, retreating to within 6 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was 1007.4 yuan, and the lowest price was 998 yuan, a fluctuation of 9.4 yuan. As a result, it fell by 4.9 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on HSBC's listed American exchange rate, remained unchanged, calculated at 32.5 yuan, equivalent to a standard gold price of over 1064 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was about 58 yuan lower, about 5 yuan weaker than the previous close. The registration price for this month was 1009 yuan, for June 1008 yuan, for July 1007 yuan, and the morning replenishment was 1009 yuan. The price of pure gold was 1012.5 yuan. The market for raw gold was quiet, with little trading. Only Ying Feng Heng sold 560 taels to Tong Feng Yong, at an addition of 15.5 yuan. Besides this, foreign firms lacked activity, and the swap premium was also stable, with less trading. Qian Chang Xiang continued to post premiums, which Hui Xiang, Ying Feng Heng, Ding Tai bought, totaling about 200 terms. Among them, there were 35 terms posted by Dai Yuan Yi. After entering the market, Yi Feng Yong and Qian Chang Xiang swapped 56 terms for 1.5 yuan. The Central Bank opened to purchase 350 terms of spot goods at a price of 1007.2 yuan, which were sold by bull companies and advanced by Fu Tai Heng and allocated to Qian Chang Xiang at a standard gold price of 5 yuan and zero. As of today, only 70 terms of this month's chits remain, accounting for two short positions (Da Feng Heng, Ying Feng Heng) and two long positions (Yuan Yi Chang Sheng Yong). Each firm's chits are scattered.</p>

<h3>Mid-Term Flour Price Slightly Increases Amidst Fluctuations in Grain Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the morning opening, each month's market showed a pattern of initial decline followed by stabilization. With the quoted prices of foreign wheat, Chicago declined by 7.5 cents and Canada declined by around 4.5 cents, market sentiment was weak at the opening, with each month dropping slightly from 0.5 to 7.5 cents. Later, due to the overcast sky and the general fear of rain, coupled with fewer factory owners and considerable purchases from inland merchants, market sentiment stabilized slightly. At the afternoon opening, things initially looked promising but then weakened again. It is rumored that the spot market in Tianjin is gradually weakening, with locally produced regular flour selling for only 1.95 yuan (comparable in quality to Shanghai's No. 2 flour). This has disheartened the merchants, and the footing of Shanghai flour is inevitably further compromised. Therefore, trading in the market was quiet again, and factory owners had little room for development. As a result, this month saw:</p>
<p>A slight improvement of 0.5 cents, June improved by 0.5 cents, July improved by 0.25 cents, and August, September, and October remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Generally Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the futures wheat market, both in the morning and afternoon openings, the market for each month was generally stable. Although the quoted prices of foreign wheat showed a slight decrease of 7.5 cents in Chicago and 4.5 cents in Canada, market sentiment turned steady due to the overcast sky and potential weather changes. The recent weather conditions greatly affect the new wheat harvest, so market fluctuations were uneasy. However, the market trading was not brisk, and customer orders were not very large. Additionally, some purchases from inland merchants helped maintain the market atmosphere. As a result, July improved by 1 cent, August improved by 3 cents, and September improved by 4 cents. The spot wheat market remains stable. Only large factories have business to attend to, while smaller factories have little demand due to the abundance of foreign wheat, thus affecting the sales of old wheat. Opening prices: Dangshan wheat at 3 yuan, Guide wheat at 3 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 2.975 yuan to 2.995 yuan, Nanjing wheat at 2.96 yuan, Suzhou wheat at 2.95 yuan. Xu Sanqian packages were taken by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>River Rice Shows Signs of Decline</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) There are over forty suppliers from various regions, with thick and thin japonica rice each accounting for about half. However, late rice is slightly more abundant. Merchant purchases are hesitant, such as the North China merchants taking in Qingjiao, Song, Si, and Fenglian goods, totaling over 2,000 packages, which initially seemed to offer some improvement. However, due to a large surplus of goods, supply exceeded demand, and the market price softened by several cents to nearly a foot. With continued sluggishness in the sales of various thick japonica rice by shops, transactions were limited, the situation was quiet, and the market situation declined. For example, the prices of Changsu and Nantong goods dropped by 10 to 20 cents. Du Yangjian rice arrived but saw little interest, with no significant gains or losses in the market. Due to the abundance of Bianyin Yuanlai goods and the slackening of sales, prices also declined by 20 to 30 cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about forty suppliers from various regions along the river. Sales of various types of rice in the market were sluggish, including white japonica and white yuan rice. Yangjian, Dujian, and Bujian rice saw slight movement, while Kejian rice had few inquiries. Sales of early thin rice were flat. Market prices for white japonica, white yuan, and early thin rice decreased slightly by 10 to 20 cents, while the prices of other varieties decreased slightly by around 10 cents.</p>
<h3>Central Customs Guest Coarse Rice Returns Slightly by Half a Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the off-take from regular customers of the guest rice was not as high as previously, and arrivals continued to increase. Some hoarders returned the guest coarse rice purchased a few days ago. The total amount of coarse rice traded for the day was only 2,250 packages, and the total amount of guest machine-milled rice traded was 1,800 packages, which was several times less than the number of packages sold in previous days. Furthermore, after the hoarders returned their stocks, the market atmosphere changed, and the upward trend was immediately reversed. Shashi special coarse rice was still priced at 7.27 yuan, while general market goods had decreased slightly to 7 yuan entering customs, with prices only at 6.9 yuan and 6.78 yuan, which was half a dime to a dime less compared to the previous market. Various grades of machine-milled rice were slightly down by a few cents to a dime. However, there was a shortage of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice in stock, and Fujian merchants and local dealers were inquiring about it. Only 200 packages were traded yesterday, and the price was still at 8.9 yuan. Small-grain rice has a relatively high price, and after the hoarders returned their guest rice and guest coarse rice yesterday, they instead purchased small-grain rice. Additionally, inland merchants and Ningbo-Shaoxing merchants absorbed the supply, totaling 5,700 packages traded throughout the day, with the price remaining at 7.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Market: Erratic Fluctuations in White Tung Oil</h3>
<p>The largest trading houses in Hankou were selling white tung oil for up to 29.6 yuan last week. After the foreign firms could not continue, the price eased to 28 yuan, but goods remained scarce. According to reports from the tung oil-producing areas of Sichuan Province, the region has fallen into bandit territory, making transportation extremely difficult. It is rumored that a large batch of oil is held up en route, repeatedly rumored to be arriving in Hankou, but has been delayed. Therefore, foreign firms are experiencing a severe shortage when procuring oil. However, once the foreign firms stop buying, there is a fear of goods flooding the market, leading to daily ups and downs in price. Recently, there have been rumors in the Hankou market that a large batch of Xiangtung oil is about to arrive, but there is no confirmation. Foreign firms need to ship goods and cannot wait, so there is a perceived shortage in supply, leading to sudden price increases. However, the current situation is different from previous years. Last year's annual output was significantly reduced, with harvests in each producing area only reaching half the normal amount. The reduction in production is undeniable. Although there is currently a slight shortage, it is not yet a critical situation. There are concerns that the transition from old to new oil may be even more challenging in the future. Zhejiang tung oil follows the ups and downs of the Hankou market, so erratic fluctuations have become commonplace. The selling price for Hangxing in Shanghai dropped from 25 yuan per dan to 24 yuan the day before yesterday, and then rebounded to over 25 yuan the next day. Prices fluctuated multiple times in a single day, leaving people confused and marking an unprecedented record. Currently, the market price is at 24.68 yuan. Local oil and hemp businesses are not rushing to buy because their inventories are still significant and domestic sales are not very strong. However, the future market is expected to have more gains than losses, so even those who are not actively seeking opportunities are unwilling to give up.</p>
<h3>Peanut Oil Plummets by Five to Six Dimes</h3>
<p>Soybean Oil also Expects Price Drops</p>
<p>Yesterday in the Caishutang oil market, only peanut oil was available, with 100 barrels of peanut oil being sold at a price of 10.02 yuan and 400 barrels in the warehouse being sold at 10 yuan. The market price was down 6 dimes for peanut oil in barrels and 5 dimes for warehouse goods compared to the highest peak on Wednesday. The reason for the price drops is that the supply is increasing, and soybean oil is performing poorly, leading to a sudden change in market sentiment. Soybean oil prices are falling due to continuous telegraphic reports, causing trading to halt in the market. Therefore, those who rely on telegraphic reports for guidance are uniformly pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestically Produced Brown Sugar Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the sugar market, with the Customs Gold Standard loosening again, the trend remained weak. The association set a price of 20.75 yuan for No. 24 raw sugar, with a few transactions occurring, down 5 cents from the previous day. Taikoo Sugar's B mark, which had been rising daily to 21 yuan, was sold at 20.85 yuan yesterday, down 1.5 dime. Domestically produced brown sugar continued to rise due to strong buying interest from traders. Guangdong merchants offered over 200 packages of Zhu Qing brown sugar at a higher price of 11.35 yuan, up about 4 dimes from the previous day. Chaozhou merchants, expecting brown rice to rise, took a wait-and-see approach and only offered 35 pieces of Huzhuang Zhengmian red sugar at 14 yuan and several dozen packages of Zhi red sugar at 13 yuan. Lianbang merchants offered a batch of Gaotong handmade rock candy at 16.4 yuan. Standard Five Blessings white sugar is temporarily in short supply due to the Xiamen factory still being in production and unable to ship goods to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Factory Silk Sales to Europe Continue Smoothly</h3>
<p>This year, the improved silkworm breeds in both Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are generally better, and a bumper harvest is expected. Silkworm silk has been placed under centralized control, and the market price of new cocoons is based on the overseas silk market, not allowed to be too high. Therefore, silk factories are boldly selling new silk futures, and British and French firms are seizing the opportunity to purchase, leading to continued smooth sales. Yesterday, Yichang and others brought in 120 packages of new factory silk, with prices remaining stable.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Silkworm Cocoon Collectors Depart</h3>
<p>The new silkworm cocoons in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou, and Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province will soon be on the market. Silk cocoon merchants in Shanghai who plan to go to collect cocoons have registered according to regulations and limits. This year's silkworm breeds are the best in terms of improved species, with the model and improved areas showing better results. Therefore, cocoon collectors have departed in succession, and silkworm funds have been sent early. Most of them are going to the model and improved areas. As a result, cocoon shops in Linping, Yuhang, Chang'an, Haining, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Lin'an, Wuxing, Pinghu, Jiaxing, and other places have mostly been rented out. The Zhejiang silkworm cocoon market is expected to be more prosperous this year than last year.</p>
<h3>Qimen New Black Tea Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yuanfeng, Runren, Yong and other tea warehouses have transported more than 800 boxes of Qimen new black tea to Shanghai. It is reported that a large batch of new goods will arrive today and tomorrow, and samples can be uniformly distributed next week.</p>
<h3>Suian Zhenmei Plummeted</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the Shanghai foreign tea market, Suian Zhenmei green tea from Lailuzhuang was being urgently sold off by Chinese merchants at reduced prices, causing the market price to plummet by 20 yuan compared to the opening price the previous day, resulting in considerable market chaos. Although Baichang Jinlong and other foreign firms had sporadic intakes of Tuzhuang Wenzhou and other Lailu Zhenmei, the selling prices were also trending downwards, creating an exceptionally pessimistic situation. However, Wenzhou Hekou and other Lailu black teas were the most stable in the market, but there were not many new goods in the market. Therefore, most local merchants and factories are seizing the opportunity to rush produce black tea for sales.</p>
<h3>Flannel Fabric Stockpiling and Transactions Arise</h3>
<p>Recently, the flannel spot market has been generally weak, both openly and secretly, while the foreign firms' prices remain stubbornly firm. Stockpiling transactions are arising among colleagues. Businesses with ample cash flow are now scouring for spot goods, while those with short-term financing are willing to sell at a discount to obtain cash. Yesterday, 42,000 flannel was being stockpiled by colleagues at a price of 5 yuan, while the current market price for common goods was 5.4 yuan. The cost of autumn and winter arrivals is estimated to be over 5.3 yuan. Twill wool flannel is being stockpiled at a price of 3.15 yuan per yard, while new arrivals are expected to cost 3.5 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Revival of the German Ideal of "Good Wife, Wise Mother"</h3>
<p>— Biyun</p>
<p>Since the black autocratic demon king Hitler ascended to the German political stage, the German news that has reached us, besides the blood of the lower classes, the persecution of Jews, and the baring of fangs in preparation for war with other countries, is the fanciful attempt to oppress women in every way. He initially deprived women of the right to vote, then forced women to leave their professions and return to the home, and recently even forced (under the guise of encouragement) women to marry. In short, he wants to completely restore the "good wife, wise mother" system of domestic slavery of the Middle Ages. His methods are: ordering all factories, schools, and various social institutions to dismiss women; establishing "women's training camps" to force women aged seventeen to twenty-five to undergo five months of training (such as caring for children, sewing, cooking, breastfeeding, and all household chores); and establishing "public marriage bureaus" to encourage marriage (those who do not marry by a certain age are subject to heavy taxes and have their professions withdrawn). These are Hitler's "new inventions" for dealing with German women, which are also one of the fascist's major national policies.</p>
<p>But why does Hitler want to oppress women in this way? According to the fascists themselves, the cancellation of women's suffrage is because women's task is only to help their husbands manage household affairs at home, have more children, and raise children. If women participate in political activities, they will inevitably abandon household chores. For the same reason, women should not leave their homes to hold social positions, and they believe that holding social positions occupies men's jobs and increases unemployment. As for forced marriage, it is even simpler and more obvious, for the sake of producing more "national" cannon fodder – so that they can fight with other countries in the future. In fact, in our view, things are not so simple. If we want to truly understand the real reason why the Hitler Party is doing such a retrogressive thing, we must seek it in its nature. Its constituent elements are mostly bankrupt petty bourgeois, soldiers, students, and hooligans. Its task is to oppose any democracy in order to establish the naked dictatorship of the capital demon king. We only need to look at all the facilities after the Hitler Party usurped power in Germany to understand. Its first action was to abolish the parliamentary system and cancel all freedoms of association, assembly, speech, publication, and belief for the masses. The whole of Germany was restored to the dark rule of the Middle Ages. In this way, German women were naturally the object of oppression. Because women in general are an exploited and oppressed class in society, they often demand liberation, demand progress, and demand democracy, and are therefore easily united with the liberation movements of other oppressed people, merging and moving forward together - this is the real reason why the fascists must oppress women and pull them back from political and social activities and lock them in their homes as slaves.</p>
<p>From the above narrative, it can be seen that the German fascists are the mortal enemies of all the exploited and oppressed; at the same time, they are also the mortal enemies of our women in general. They have deprived us of the political rights and professional rights that German women have gained through years of hard struggle, and have once again forcibly brought our women back from society to forcibly serve as domestic slaves to men under the beautiful name of good wives and wise mothers, and are also forcing them to step up the manufacture of "cannon fodder" for the war they are preparing for. Is not the tragic fate suffered by German women in the last World War enough? Millions of women lost their husbands and abandoned their children, and their wounds have not yet fully healed, but the cannibalistic Hitler Party is now preparing to mobilize their husbands and sons to eat bullets! What a terrible future is placed before German women! Women all over the world should rise up against this retrogressive method. We should declare that the good wife and wise mother system is a heavy shackle that locks women in their homes as slaves, and a tool used by all reactionary forces to control women in general! The task of our women's liberation is first to smash this shackle. We believe that German women will eventually unite with all the oppressed people and smash this shackle on their heads.</p>
<h3>Prayer - For the Unjust Death of Lu Yin -</h3>
<p>— Biyao</p>
<p>At a quarter past nine on the morning of May 12th, I arrived at the Municipal Council Girls' Middle School. As I walked past the door of the principal's office, I saw a dozen female teachers standing, sitting, and leaning, all with long faces. I suddenly felt as if I had been electrified and mechanically stepped into the room. Apart from sighs, someone was intermittently talking about Lu Yin's life: saying that she was a lonely and bleak child, a hardworking young woman who, after graduating from middle school, immediately sought food in all directions and saved money to enter university, a warrior under the old ethics who was bound to a married man by life and death, a compassionate mother who held up the heavy cross of life for her orphaned child, ... Their voices were so desolate, I felt as if I were listening to someone reading Cai Yan's poem of grief and indignation.</p>
<p>The bell rang, and I had to go to class. The first question from the students was about Lu Yin's illness: I answered them with silence, and they lowered their heads and understood in silence. Suddenly, the principal opened the back door of the classroom, and she released a string of small firecrackers into the quiet classroom, which was what she said: "Mr. Huang Luyin is in critical condition, everyone! It's best to pray for her." This firecracker-like voice, even though I was not a Christian, made me stand stunned in front of the window, and the sentence "May this person live long!" flowed from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>prayer.</p>
<p>The next day, Sunday, the red sun emerged from the sea in the east, just crossing into the middle of the azure sky; while Lu Yin, who had a reputation in the literary world, had closed her eyes and passed away, bearing spiritual and physical suffering.</p>
<p>"Death" is inevitable for anyone, anytime, anywhere, but what differs is that she failed to encounter fairness and justice. In this cultural center, in broad daylight, someone could have their body destroyed by a quack doctor who poisoned their uterus during a normal childbirth! Her body was what she could not bear to abandon, even though she had suffered many storms and humiliations, because of her orphan. What a desert place this is! So chaotic, so disorderly, so desolate, so unrestrained, so painful to live, so sad to die!</p>
<p>In the moment before her death, Lu Yin held a child in each hand, showing the love of mothers all over the world for their children. It is a pity that there is not a single corner of a children's paradise here! There are airplanes everywhere, stray bullets, domestic wolves, foreign dogs, hungry ghosts, plague gods, cruel officials, quack doctors, and everything outside the rails that devours people. Whether mothers let go of their children or not, their</p>
<p>anxiety can never have a moment's rest. Lu Yin's soul does not know where it is floating at this moment, but what can be known is that the stubborn stone of anxiety must be heavily pressing on her heart.</p>
<p>Who can endure all the love, all the plans, all the ideals, being sacrificed in a meaningless moment? Moreover, watching with their own eyes the fresh blood flowing from their own wounds, and hearing the moans of their beloved children and friends in the wilderness, by the fences, in the heart of the street, and in front of the prison?</p>
<p>Ah! Before the dry desert is turned into a moist paddy field, I wish to have this prayer: "May the unjustly dead soul immediately dissipate!"</p>
<h3>Opinions of Great World Thinkers on Women's Issues (7)</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>6 Fourier (Continued)</p>
<p>Regarding Fourier's views on the emancipation of women, we have briefly discussed them last time, and now we will</p>
<p>describe his ideal society of equal rights for men and women.</p>
<p>Fourier believed that under the current social system, the most uneconomical thing, which is also the most binding on the development of women's intelligence and the masking of women's talents, is the management of household affairs and the care of children. Therefore, he advocated public education for children, socialization of household affairs, and strove to realize it. He believed that if household affairs could be socialized</p>
<p>, and children could be publicly educated, the whole society could save a lot of strength and gain dozens of times the benefits. He said that in cities</p>
<p>three-quarters of women, and in the countryside half of the women, are living a parasitic life, wasting their energy on personal livelihoods and families</p>
<p>life; three-quarters of the children in cities and half of the children in the countryside are earning very little; three-quarters of the domestic servants and half of the maids are the same. Therefore, the estimated value of women's daily work is five times lower than the estimated value of men's daily work. Only cooperative organizations of industry, handicrafts, farmers, and domestic labor can eliminate the unconscious waste of women's energy and their slave life, etc.</p>
<p>However, the cooperative group system that Fourier envisioned is not communist. He advocated maintaining private property, inheritance rights, and the collection of interest, etc., but the labor organization and group life that he envisioned had greatly limited the power of private property. Fourier called his envisioned cooperative organization "Phalanstery"</p>
<p>(Ｐｈａｌａｎｘ), each "Phalanstery" contains 1,800 to 2,000</p>
<p>people, including men, women, and children. Regarding the work of women in the Phalanstery, he said:</p>
<p>"The first principle is that the work in each Phalanstery must have a strict plan, and all work, whether male or female and children, can obtain it equally;</p>
<p>The second principle is that half of the profit-making occupations must be given to women. Today, the most unfavorable work is placed on the shoulders of women, as if women are born only to cook and mend torn pants. This kind of phenomenon should be avoided in the future. Women in the Phalanstery will undertake the mission of God – that is, to stand in a competitive position with men, not to obey men."</p>
<p>Fourier also said in another place: "In the arts, women will gain glory because a well-organized society will train them according to the true nature of women. This nature is drowned by the social system that unconsciously wastes women's energy on personal livelihoods."</p>
<p>Some "philosophers" believe that a woman without talent is virtuous, but Fourier vehemently attacked this view. According to his opinion, this kind of argument is unfounded. He said: "In the future, the cooperation of household affairs can make things very simple, and only one-eighth of the women's energy currently consumed can be used to cope with it easily." Therefore, he believes that in the future there will be no need to humiliate women with slave education.</p>
<p>According to Fourier's opinion, the</p>
<p>mission of women can be inferred from outstanding women. The personality of these outstanding women is a guarantee that women can compete with men in talent. However, women's talents can only be fully expressed when they can develop freely. According to Fourier's opinion, this can only be done in a cooperative organization - the "Phalanstery", only after women have received appropriate education. The basis of this education is labor, productive labor, and children should be trained in this kind of productive labor from an early age.</p>
<p>In short, in Fourier's view, the political system is not important;</p>
<p>only the economic and social system is most important. Therefore, the rights of women in politics have not been paid attention to in his plan to transform society. However, in the cooperative organization he envisioned - the "Phalanstery", women are equal to men, whether in labor, education, or management. Although Fourier's plan for a great harmony society is not built on a solid economic foundation, his brilliant critique of capitalist society has an indelible value.</p>
<p>The Dingxian Family Purchasing Cooperative, sponsored by the China Mass Education Promotion Association, was formally established on March 1. The picture on the right was taken at the inaugural meeting of the cooperative. Posted by Zhang Shen</p>
<h3>Leisure Jottings - A Multifaceted View on Gong Yinxia's Suicide -</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>It was past 3:30 in the afternoon, and nearly six hours of burying oneself in books had indeed made one feel tired. The quiet office gradually stirred with activity. Some left their seats to walk around, others leaned back in their chairs stretching, and still others flipped through various newspapers and magazines. The telephone also began to ring among them.</p>
<p>B, who advocated for virtuous mothers and good wives, was reading the newspaper and muttering to himself, "This is truly great! Look at her calmly facing death. Is it something someone without willpower could do? If this spirit of sacrifice is expanded and amplified, isn't it the action of a righteous person or martyr? China has deteriorated to this state because the people are greedy for life and fear death. What a great spirit of not fearing death!" His words were filled with admiration.</p>
<p>Y, sitting nearby, heard his remarks and, with a flushed face and anger, said, "What greatness! What spirit of sacrifice! This is simply a crime, a crime that cannot be forgiven! It's already inexcusable to fear life and commit suicide without the spirit to fight. Moreover, to drag three ignorant and innocent children to their deaths is unforgivable in the eyes of the law."</p>
<p>"..." C, who had been listening, felt she could no longer remain silent. "She definitely had no reason to commit suicide. Love, economics, the old ethics, none of these were reasons for her suicide. Judging from her suicide note, whether she received old or new education, she at least had good tools. With her position, it wouldn't have been difficult to strive to be a useful person. This suicide is simply meaningless. To entice her children to die with her is even more foolish!" That is what she said.</p>
<p>"I dare say, it is so inhumane for her to kill her children!" Y said fiercely again.</p>
<p>"Hmph! Inhumane! Isn't it in accordance with the way of ghosts? B said, "I believe Ms. Gong was a believer in the 'ghost theory'. She thought that by dying like this, the husband, wife, and children would still be together. Isn't this in accordance with the way of ghosts? D! What do you think?"</p>
<p>Amid such heated debate, D, who felt there was no opportunity to interject, was asked this question and began to express his opinion with confidence: "I believe everyone has the right to dispose of their own life, so suicide is a method of dealing with life. No matter what kind of suicide, others should not criticize it; however, inciting others to commit suicide is absolutely inappropriate. Parents have the right to protect their children, but they do not have the right to kill them. This kind of overstepping is really infringing on the freedom of others."</p>
<p>Y, with her anger still not dissipated, said, "If this Ms. Xi could be saved…!"</p>
<p>"Of course, she would still commit suicide," B interrupted before he could finish.</p>
<p>"Don't allow her to commit suicide, definitely don't allow it," Y added emphatically, "She must be punished for her crime."</p>
<p>For a time, discussions were rife, and one could hear people talking about Ms. Xi and suicide everywhere. The issue had become the focus of conversation.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason for Ms. Gong's suicide, she was, after all, a weak person. As for me, because I am also a weak person, I often find it easy to sympathize with the weak. She has already committed suicide, and it was a very tragic suicide. I seem unable to add more condemnation and blame. Although I dare not praise suicide, I very much hope that it can have some passive effect. Because of this issue, it has attracted social attention and public opinion. On one hand, those in a similar situation to Ms. Gong may be able to gain a more accurate view from the public's opinion on this issue and avoid following in her footsteps. On the other hand, when studying the reasons for her suicide, a small ripple may be stirred in people's hearts. This ripple may launch a powerful attack on the main cause of her suicide – the cannibalistic old ethics – or at least generate a kind of disgust and hatred towards it. This is a little hope from me, a weakling.</p>
<h3>Simple Disinfection Methods for the Home</h3>
<p>— Dubu</p>
<p>The season in which infectious germs easily breed, summer, is approaching. It is necessary to be well-prepared with disinfection methods for the home, but many procedures are not easily implemented, making them difficult to popularize. Here are a few simple disinfection methods that are easy to carry out, provided for your reference.</p>
<p>Clothing</p>
<p>The most complete method for disinfecting clothing is steam disinfection. Although boiling can be used for complete disinfection in the home, expensive silk items must be disinfected with "Formalin" vapor or a 3% carbolic acid solution. As for socks and stockings, they can first be soaked in a 1% carbolic acid solution or "Creosol" solution, or "Lysol" solution for about two hours, then taken out and washed clean, or boiled in soapy water. However, as the material of clothing is mostly dark-colored, attention must be paid to preventing fading. Another simple method is to use sunlight disinfection, which is very effective if repeated.</p>
<p>Tableware</p>
<p>For disinfection of eating utensils, they can be boiled in clean water or soda water for about 15 minutes, then taken out. As for the eating utensils used by patients, they must be boiled immediately after use and then exposed to sunlight for complete disinfection. Items such as bowls and chopsticks can be immersed in a 1% "Formalin" solution for about an hour, then washed clean with water to avoid the attachment of infectious germs.</p>
<p>Hands</p>
<p>Hand disinfection is easily overlooked, but it is actually a very important matter. Hands can be disinfected by wiping them with a 2% "Creosol" solution, or "Creosol" soapy water, or alcohol.</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>Vegetables and fruits often have parasitic eggs and pathogens adhering to them. They must be carefully washed. Because they mostly adhere to the outside of vegetables and fruits, the only method is to rinse them with water. As for birds, beasts, fish, and meat, they are mostly eaten cooked, so there is no need to worry. If eating raw fish or shrimp, be sure to choose fresh and clean ones, and dipping them in wine or vinegar is also a simple form of disinfection.</p>
<p>Residence</p>
<p>Before moving in, in addition to a very thorough cleaning, disinfection is also necessary. Disinfection methods for residences can be implemented differently depending on the location and materials. For things like board walls and glass windows, they can be washed with a 2% carbolic acid solution or a 1% "Creosol" solution. For things like mud walls and paper windows, they must be wiped with soft cloths. If the house can be sealed, disinfecting it with "Formalin" and then fully exposing it to sunlight is the most complete disinfection. For mud floors and stone slabs, a 2% carbolic acid solution can be used. For places such as toilets and ditches, a 30% lime milk solution can be used for disinfection.</p>
<h3>A Victim of the Old Ethics</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>According to Tianjin newspapers, there was a Ms. Sun Peirong, whose parents died early, leaving her orphaned and alone. She was raised by her maternal grandparents. She was married last year, and now, in her eighth month of marriage, she was suddenly accused of not being a virgin. Her uncle's family, considering it a stain on their reputation, advocated for her to be buried alive. Ms. Sun, terrified by the ethics, committed suicide by poisoning herself at the beginning of this month. It can be seen that the cannibalistic old ethics are still deeply rooted in our current society.</p>

<h3>Mother's Notes (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhan Quan</p>
<p>(3) Nourishment and the Poor</p>
<p>Children without fathers should receive extra love and care from their mothers, such as providing them with nutritious food at all times and appropriate treatment for their illnesses. However, I watch helplessly as my two frail children's bodies lengthen like bean sprouts as time goes on, but their low weight, weak strength, pale faces, digestive problems, and restless dreams all clearly tell me that their growth is not healthy but is instead a morbid and deformed development. The older child's condition is even weaker and more frail because he was not properly cared for after childhood illnesses and has spent an unstable and wandering life following his parents. He has symptoms of a named disease. If I am not afraid of frightening myself, isn't this child's condition simply what is commonly called childhood labor? However, for the sake of convenience, he is still living his boarding life isolated from me. The coarseness of the food and the lack of proper clothing there go without saying, but it is still worse than at home. When I think of the difficulties caused by my own decline, especially when I think of the strong and healthy personnel that future society needs, I not only sympathize with the children's weakness, but I also clearly recognize that it is my inescapable responsibility as a mother to adjust and cultivate them early.</p>
<p>Therefore, in front of a friend who understands a little about medicine, I sincerely and attentively ask for simple methods to make my children stronger and free them from illness. Coincidentally, the answer others give me is management and treatment. To be more specific, chicken broth, beef broth, eggs, milk, etc., should be taken often. In addition, in order to remedy the congenital and acquired deficiencies of children with glandular constitutions, taking cod liver oil is the best method, and the brand of liver oil should be Kepler's. In addition, injections to replenish blood are also said to be a method.</p>
<p>When I talked to a young and wealthy girlfriend, a recently married woman, about my little daughter's weight loss after starting school and asked her whether I should immediately stop her from attending school, she answered very readily: "Don't let her interrupt. I'd rather find another way to supplement her body with nourishment." How to supplement? The first thing she mentioned was imported Bovril beef juice.</p>
<p>Ah, thank you, my friends. It was as if I heard some beautiful hygiene stories, but is it possible for me to realize these? In the meals I order from the school next door and the meals my older child eats at school, even slices of meat are rarely seen. What else can you hope for? If I could regularly supplement some nutritious side dishes outside of regular meals, would I need to order meals at all?</p>

<h3>Preliminary Steps for Electoral Reform</h3>
<p>— Gong Pu</p>
<p>The biggest shortcoming of past elections in China, in stark contrast to Europe and the United States, is that while political parties in Europe and the United States manipulate elections in order to implement their policies, China does not. Elections are merely a shortcut for local bullies and gentry to gain official positions. The failure of democratic politics in Europe and the United States is a shortcoming of the social system itself, not a fault of the electoral system. Although their political parties are often tools of the bourgeoisie, they still advocate policies to win the trust of the people in order to be elected. As for China, judging from the elections held in the past, the purpose of the candidates is definitely not to defend the interests of a certain group of people, let alone political views. They simply want to use the elections to replace seeking power and influence, in order to gain official positions and wealth. Since the motives of these candidates are questionable, they obviously have no chance of being elected except through electoral fraud. Therefore, in order to realize the realization of popular governance in China, in addition to the fundamental transformation of the social system, the electoral system must first be clarified. The root cause of the corruption of the electoral system is the indifference of the general public to politics and their ignorance of what elections are. Therefore, this kind of malady is more prominent in local elections than in central elections. And local autonomy is the foundation of popular governance, so our preliminary steps have to start with reforming local elections first.</p>
<p>We have four points of opinion on the principles and steps for reforming the electoral system:</p>
<p>(1) Elections should be made known to the people. Readers must be surprised that I put forward this point. Is it possible that our past elections were not meant to be known to the people? In fact, although the government did not hold elections secretly in the past, the actual number of people who knew about the elections was small. This is certainly caused by the low level of national intelligence, but if we want to make elections truly successful, those who conduct the elections should undoubtedly take on this responsibility tirelessly, and use various methods beforehand, such as holding civic meetings or printing leaflets and distributing them to voters, to conduct various election campaigns. The main purposes of this kind of propaganda are three points: (1) to make the people know that elections are being held; (2) to make the people understand the meaning of elections; (3) to extract important issues that should be noted in municipal administration, to induce the people's political interest, thus emphasizing elections and paying attention to candidates.</p>
<p>(2) Open campaigning. Candidates in our country appear to be extremely noble on the surface, but secretly they are sneaky, using bribery, buying, and all kinds of illegal acts to seek election. The reason has been said before, that is, the purpose of these people running for election is too impure. If they let others know that they are running for election, they will undoubtedly be spurned by the people. But we know that if a candidate's purpose is to realize his political views, then we should not only not despise this kind of candidate's campaign movement, but also actively encourage it. In this way, those with political views can develop their ambitions, and voters also have standards to choose from. We should follow the conventions of Europe and the United States, adopt the "voter proposes candidates" system, and actively encourage "candidates to conduct public publicity."</p>
<p>(3) Special attention should be paid to township elections. Although Chinese people have extremely little interest in politics, they have a strong sense of local identity. Therefore, we should pay special attention to small-scale elections such as townships. In this kind of election, it is easy to have good elections, because there are fewer people in this kind of election, and the elected person must be a person familiar to the voters. Moreover, since the relationship between township governance and the people is extremely close, voters have no reason to vote casually for candidates.</p>
<p>(4) The preparation time for elections should be long. The purpose of this point is very simple, and it is to give voters the opportunity to fully understand and consider the elections and candidates.</p>
<p>In short, to encourage the people's interest in elections, we must make the people know the great importance of the relationship between autonomy and municipal administration and individuals. If the gains and losses of municipal administration proposals can become the standards for voters to elect and the key to the success or failure of candidates, then events of electoral fraud will not occur, and the prosperity of municipal administration can also be predicted. The above-mentioned points are only about the more obvious problems in reforming the accumulated malpractices of Chinese elections. As for other technical issues of elections, such as voter registration, voting procedures, and the long-term system, there are already established practices in Europe and the United States, and we can adapt them to local conditions and learn from each other's strengths. At this time, the reporter does not need to say more.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Working in a Pawnshop</h3>
<p>— Peng Xu</p>
<p>I'm from Anhui, and because I was oppressed by poverty, when I was a twelve- or thirteen-year-old child, I ran from my impoverished rural village to this big metropolis of Shanghai. Fortunately, a relative showed me great favor and recommended me for a job at a pawnshop. This was really lucky for me!</p>
<p>Originally, "Huizhou pawnshop clerks" were a famous and respectable profession, so as soon as I entered the pawnshop, I was also somewhat respectable. When I went outside, people would always call me "pawnshop clerk."</p>
<p>I remember when I entered the shop, a relative led me to pay my respects to several senior clerks and bow to my fellow apprentices. After being recognized by the executive clerk, I was considered one of "us." Sweeping the floor, wiping the tables, sweeping up cat droppings, mixing cat food, adding food, etc., were all fixed tasks that I did every day according to the time. In addition, there was finding and carrying packages. Three or four apprentices commanded each other layer by layer, and needless to say, the "student leader" had it easiest, ordering the junior apprentices to do everything, while they themselves still received their salaries. Therefore, all apprentices hoped to have this day. But when I reached this level, a different hope arose.</p>
<p>Speaking of pawnshops, the idea of class is very heavy. At the top is the senior clerk; the accounting room, the cash room, and the package manager are internal positions; together with the counter clerks who deal with customers, they are considered senior and important people. Writing pawn tickets, wrapping packages, and hanging tags are middle-level positions. And the next level? I dare not say, but it's the student apprentices that I currently lead.</p>
<p>The hope I mentioned above is to become a package wrapper. The position of package wrapper is very leisurely. Lazy ones can do nothing from the time they open their eyes in the morning until three in the afternoon, sleeping, playing, writing, reading, whatever you want. After three o'clock, you only need to wrap up the items pawned that day in the most appropriate way and put them away. After closing, you can do whatever you want again. However, although that's what they say, the several package wrappers I've seen with my own eyes all wear worried expressions and complain about the hard work, because almost thousands of pounds of items pass through their hands every day. All the strength of both hands is concentrated and exerted in these three or four hours, which is very harmful to the body. Now I think: if I'm not lazy in the morning and wrap up half of the items pawned in the morning first, and rest more in the afternoon, then it's already divided into two times, and the body won't be harmed. Moreover, package wrappers have more free time, which can be used for reading and writing, wouldn't that be good? Needless to say, the salary is one level higher. But where is there such a good opportunity for promotion?</p>
<p>I know that I am a straightforward person and can't stand grievances in my stomach, so I don't hope to become a counter clerk. Because a counter clerk is subject to the package manager. If an item is pawned for too much, you have to listen to lectures, and sometimes even compensate. If you calculate the interest wrong by even one copper coin, you also have to compensate. As for the customers, those who enter the door mostly already have an unhappy expression. If they hear that the item can't be pawned or that the interest is too high, they will vent their anger on you. Even if you are a magnanimous person, you will be unhappy for several days, or even be criticized by the manager. So I hope not to be promoted for the rest of my life, but sometimes because of economic pressure, I can't help but think about it.</p>
<p>If someone – someone in the industry – wants to seek some knowledge during their service time and is not under urgent financial pressure, it is best to be a package wrapper. Although you are not allowed to go out at night without a reason, and you must not indulge in smoking, drinking, prostitution, or gambling, it is still worthwhile to protect your body in the end.</p>
<h3>Lending Rice</h3>
<p>— Hui Zhenjia</p>
<p>Friends, don't treat the words "lending rice" the same way as so-called distributing porridge or disaster relief, although on the surface they both contain the meaning of relief, but there are many differences, the biggest being that lending rice can collect an additional 30% interest (30 yuan of interest for every 100 yuan per month), while distributing porridge or disaster relief is a one-time thing and even the capital cannot be recovered (this has its own indirect effect for those who distribute it).</p>
<p>Since the purpose of lending rice is to make a profit, the ruthlessness of its means does not take a secondary position in this exploitative society: white rice costs 8 yuan or 7.5 yuan per stone (according to the current rice price). Those who take rice (the same as taking a loan) must return 9 yuan or 8.5 yuan after half a month for every stone they take (some take one dou), and if they cannot return it after half a month, they must add one yuan in interest, and return the same amount in the second half of the month. This so-called "adding interest" seems to be a "fine," but in fact, a group of hungry friends who take rice have no way of escaping this "adding interest." Why? The only explanation is that their income is not guaranteed. There is also the saying of "deducting the measuring standard" for the rice they take (meaning giving less rice), and in fact, one or two sheng are deducted from each stone! Do you think that this person who lends rice has the slightest bit of relief?</p>
<p>"Poor people can endure hardship," this sentence is indeed true. Taking rice to eat and temporarily preserving life seems like a kind of grace, but ultimately it cannot withstand the cruelty of exploitation!</p>
<p>Therefore, I am also terrified of what kind of unfavorable future the currently so-called grace of "cooperation" and "friendship" will lead to.</p>
<h3>Dance Troupes</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>When we talk about dance, it is easy for a group of semi-nude young girls dancing vivaciously on stage to appear in our minds. In today's world, where everyone wants to escape reality and indulge in the pleasures of the flesh, the appreciation of female beauty has undoubtedly become the greatest interest of those upper-middle-class playboys, hedonists, and the decadent. The rise of dance troupes has its social origins in this.</p>
<p>The earliest dances appeared in the form of children's operas. Eight or nine years ago, primary schools, for the sake of variety show programs, had to train their students to perform song and dance dramas such as "Sparrows and Children," "Three Butterflies," "Grape Fairies," and "Moonlit Night." Gradually, this became a trend, and some normal schools and girls' normal schools that cultivated teachers began to pay attention to cultivating dance teachers to meet the needs. A group of young girls, pretending to be butterflies and cats on stage, was already quite interesting; if they went a step further and performed love dramas such as "Drizzling Rain," it is self-evident that they would cause a sensation among the audience.</p>
<p>The organizers of the dances saw this point clearly and believed that it was a good opportunity to make money, so the dance troupe came into being. The professionalization of dance is inseparable from this "erotic" element.</p>
<p>Having understood the development process of this kind of dance, I can now go on to talk about the organizational content of the current dance troupes and the lives of the dancers and musicians. Organizationally, a dance troupe often has a leader or a "troupe boss": if two people are jointly running it, then there are undoubtedly two "bosses." A dance troupe cannot have fewer than seven dancers, otherwise, the tricks that come out will definitely not "draw applause"; even if there are fifteen or sixteen dancers, it cannot be considered too many. At least three or four musicians are needed, such as piano players, violin players, drummers, and erhu players, all of which are indispensable. This is still keeping it simple. The largest dance troupes usually have thirty or forty performers. The salaries of the dancers are based on their beauty and dance skills. There are usually two methods of calculating wages, one is calculated by the month, and the other is calculated by the day, and calculating by the day is more common. It is very good for a dancer to earn fifty or sixty yuan per month. The most can reach eighty or ninety yuan (such high prices are rare recently), but usually it is only about twenty yuan. For those calculated by the day, two yuan a day is very good, three yuan a day is rare, and one yuan a day is very common. There will definitely not be "business" every day, so the boss is happy to use this method of calculating wages by the day to reduce their own expenses and increase their own profits.</p>
<p>The salaries of musicians also vary greatly depending on their skills. However, these are about the same as the dancers, so there is no need to elaborate here.</p>
<p>Regarding the program, I would like to talk about it in four aspects. First of all, I want to talk about "dance." Those that require a large number of people on stage include the "troupe dance" (used for opening the show) and "sailor dance," "carnival dance," etc., which represent the troupe. Those that require fewer people or only one person include "duet dance," "Charleston," "solo dance," and "costume dance." The most playful and the one that the dance troupe uses to attract viewers is the "hula dance" with bare breasts and navels. Secondly, I want to talk about "song and dance." This is the lifeline of the dance troupe, and the best "tricks" are probably concentrated in this part. "Peach Blossom River," "Dance Partner's Song," "Little Painter," "Wedding Night," "Dream Lover"</p>
<p>"Three Butterflies," "Good Friends Are Here," "Poor Qiu Xiang," "Drizzling Rain," "Sister, I Love You"</p>
<p>"..." etc. are the center of these fun things and are the most likely to win the audience's appreciation. However, most of the girls in professional dance troupes have passed the age of fifteen, and their age is no longer suitable for performing "Three Butterflies" and "Good Friends Are Here," although these two programs are still performed a lot. Also, such as "Little Painter," it is quite interesting, but it always feels a bit inappropriate for a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old girl to play a naughty child.</p>
<p>Secondly, I must mention "solo singing."</p>
<p>There must be a girl with a beautiful voice who can use her wonderful voice to win the audience's applause. Furthermore, backstage, dancers often have some trouble changing clothes or putting on makeup, and in fact, someone is needed on stage to suppress the commotion of the audience. A solo singer in full costume is needed in this situation. Solo singing</p>
<p>programs, such as "Poor Qiu Xiang," "Zhao Jun's Lament," "Human Face Peach Blossom," "Winter Clothes Song," "Spring Night Song," "In the Night Garden," "All Love," "Night Fragrance," etc., are all very common and very popular.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about drama. I said that the rise of dance is inextricably linked to the eroticization of its content. More advanced audiences may not be attracted to this kind of dance at all. And the lower-level audiences, they have already experienced it, and have no eternal interest in dance. The lack of content in dance has led it to the path of decline. At this time, it reaches out to drama for help. The troupe bosses often use drama to restore the audience they may hope to get. However, their so-called drama is actually a civilized drama, often without scripts or lines, and relying on the actors' talent to hastily take the stage, performing some irrelevant national affairs and things that ladies, misses, and young masters like.</p>
<p>The talents of each dance troupe are very different. Some can compose their own dance music and create their own dance moves; some feel that their own talents are not enough, and spend hundreds of yuan to hire foreign experts to teach various dance skills. Some can humbly contact celebrities in the literary, art, music, and film circles and seek their guidance. They even had a handshake with the martial arts world at one time, because things like martial arts can also be inserted into the dance as a program. Although these all indicate that the dance scene is in a situation where it cannot be supported alone, this does not necessarily mean that dance has reached the end of the road. Not only is the "sensuality" still quite appealing to the audience, but they also have a good way out at the moment, which is "going to Nanyang." Performing in various ports in the country, such as Hankou and Tianjin, may even lose the fare back to Shanghai and have to pawn things to return (this has happened several times); but going to Nanyang is different, there are many wealthy overseas Chinese there, they love their motherland and also like the things of their motherland, going there is a sure way to make money. Didn't the troupe boss of the XX Dance Troupe return from there with a lot of money? Aren't each dancer and musician returning with at least three to five hundred yuan left over? So "going to Nanyang" has become a slogan in the current dance world. I know that there are currently two dance groups making such preparations.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk a little about the private lives of the dancers and musicians. The backgrounds of the dancers are obviously from the lower or declining middle class. For the sake of their own and their families' lives, they have to exchange "thighs and breasts" for bread. Most of the feudal concepts have been stripped from them, and that kind of environment requires them to be a little more dissolute, so almost everyone is very open-minded and liberated. They have abandoned the shyness of a girl from a modest family. When you hear their talk about love, you may feel that you are very backward. Because of this lack of restraint, they are often deprived of their chastity. It is not surprising for a dancer to become the boss's wife or the troupe boss's wife. It is also very common for a dancer and a musician to "get together," but he does not marry her, or even dumps her. Sometimes, some big shots, important people, young masters, and young masters bully them, and they have to swallow their tears. Most of them are really poor girls struggling for a living!</p>
<p>The lives of musicians are also equally miserable. Their environment makes it easy for them to dream pink dreams, but their income often interrupts their excitement. I have seen some of their nervous and depressed faces. There was a musician who hadn't returned to his hometown for nine years because things hadn't gone well outside and he didn't have the face to go back to see his "elders in Jiangdong," even though he was deeply missing his family.</p>
<p>Finally, I might as well briefly talk about the situation of Shanghai dance troupes. "Mingyue," "Meihua," and "Xiaying" were popular in Shanghai for a while and had a certain reputation. "Jimei," "Yinhua," "Mingming," "Huaguang," "Taohua," "Shanghai," and other dance troupes either perform in amusement parks such as the Great World, Datian World, Sincere Amusement Park, and Little World to maintain their survival, or enter third- and fourth-class cinemas and split the remaining profits with the cinema owners in a ratio of three to seven or four to six, or go to other ports to "open up a market" and earn some money—most of their careers are very difficult.</p>

<h3>German Economic Research</h3>
<p>— Zhao</p>
<p>Since Hitler took office on January 30 last year, he has continuously announced many controlled economic policies. Among them, the unemployment relief policy, the rural revitalization policy, the export trade promotion policy, the domestic consumption promotion policy, and the mark blockade policy are all well-known. Since the implementation of these control policies, although some achievements have been partially obtained, from an overall perspective, they are still ineffective.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the unemployment relief policy. Although the official figures show that the number of unemployed people has decreased by nearly three million from the end of February last year to the end of February this year (six million at the end of February last year and three million and three hundred thousand at the end of February this year), it is still doubtful whether it is actually reliable. Assuming that this figure is reliable, we cannot conclude that the Nazi Party's policy has achieved great results. This can be understood by looking at the following situation.</p>
<p>First, in order to reduce the number of unemployed people, the Nazi Party dismissed all married female workers. The reason is that since the husband has a job, the wife should stay at home to take care of private affairs. In order to achieve this goal perfectly, they cleverly used the slogan of "good wife and loving mother" to suppress public resentment.</p>
<p>Second, as everyone knows, the Nazi Party regarded the XX Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Jews as their greatest enemies. Therefore, all laborers belonging to the XX Party, the Social Democratic Party, and those of Jewish origin, regardless of gender, age, or child, were all expelled from the country. This will naturally also reduce a batch of unemployed people.</p>
<p>Third, under the Nazi Party's unemployment relief policy, a forced labor system was cleverly established. That is, all work is completely distributed by the government, regardless of whether you are willing to do it or not. Most of the work obtained under this forced labor system is in military industrial affairs and military affairs.</p>
<p>In addition, it is also stipulated that workers cannot hold concurrent jobs.</p>
<p>Although we cannot obtain accurate figures for the laborers sacrificed due to the above conditions (in fact, it is also impossible), as long as we check various labor information in Germany in the past year, we can immediately understand the falsehood of the German official report.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at the Nazi Party's rural revitalization policy. The Nazi Party's agricultural control policy, like other capitalist countries, also starts with raising the prices of agricultural products. Under this policy, on the one hand, the import of foreign agricultural products is restricted, and on the other hand, the policy of setting official prices for agricultural products is adopted. After the implementation of this policy, some effects were indeed seen. The wholesale price index of agricultural products was 809 in January last year, and it rose to 878 in August. Farmers have indeed benefited a little, but laborers whose wages are falling have encountered very difficult situations. Thus, the rural revitalization policy and the unemployment relief policy are exactly at opposite poles.</p>
<p>Since the situation in the country is already like this, what about the situation abroad? This is another contradiction. Although the Nazi Party is actively working to increase exports, it is in a very unfavorable position in terms of foreign exchange rates, so it is difficult to break through the siege (because Germany still maintains the gold standard). In this situation, the Nazi Party decided to adopt a mark blockade policy, that is, all mark funds owned by foreigners must not be transferred out of Germany, but are completely blocked within Germany. The Nazi Party used this policy to gain a slight foothold in exchange rates (detailed situation will be described in another article), but there is still no good effect in trade.</p>
<p>In addition, the issues of reparations, finance, and the financial crisis have not been completely resolved. Therefore, looking at the achievements of the Nazi Party's rule in the past year and the promises it made to the public before taking office, there is still a long way to go.</p>

<h3>The Effectiveness of Italy's Agricultural Revitalization Policy</h3>
<p>— Zhuang You</p>
<p>I. The Decline of Italian Agriculture After World War I</p>
<p>After the end of the European War, Italy leapt to become one of the world's five powers, dominating Southern Europe. Although the result of this betrayal alliance fulfilled the wishes of the authorities with soaring ambitions, the post-war Italian economy was in a state of bankruptcy. Originally, Italian industry was dominated by agriculture. Farmers accounted for 55% of the total population; and agricultural income tax accounted for about 30 to 32 billion lire out of the total annual revenue of the national treasury of 8.5 billion to 10 billion lire (Italian currency name). From this, it can be seen the importance of agriculture in the Italian economic system. However, after the European War, political chaos and social disorder made people unable to live in peace. Many abandoned farmland and flocked to cities, causing agriculture to suffer a major blow, resulting in a sharp reduction in productivity and a sudden increase in the amount of imports exceeding exports. From 1913 to 1919, foreign food imports increased sharply from 700 million lire to 5.2 billion lire. Imports of grains, meats, and other items increased significantly, while exports of major products such as flour and fruits came to a complete standstill. At the same time, industrial raw materials were entirely dependent on foreign imports. At that time, the decline of Italian agriculture plunged the entire national economic system into an extremely unstable state.</p>
<p>II. Mussolini's Agricultural Revitalization Movement</p>
<p>In 1922, when the Fascist Party came to power, the eccentric Mussolini took the stage, dictating all of Italy. Seeing the economic crisis in the country, and at the same time his policy of increasing the population was successful (the current total number of residents in Italy is 42,554,000, an increase of 3,799,000 compared to 1921, and the annual productivity exceeds the mortality rate by 500,000). He believed that in order to solve these two problems, it was necessary to revive the most important agriculture in the country, and immediately drafted a plan for agricultural revitalization and put it into effect. Soprai, the mastermind of the matter, once said, "If our country wants to develop national strength and promote national culture in this environment of narrow land and a large population and a lack of natural resources, we must create a new center for rural life to increase annual income. At the same time, we should protect and organize the safety and productivity of rural life to resist the destructive power of cities." From this, we can see the great importance of agricultural revitalization to Italy's economy and governance. This matter has become the policy that the Fascist government is eager to implement.</p>
<p>III. Reclaiming Wasteland into Fertile Land</p>
<p>Reclaiming barren and infertile land is the most important plan in Italy's agricultural revitalization movement. Because most of Italy is mountainous, all of which is barren and cannot be planted, if it is once developed, the area of cultivation can be expanded, and the amount of production can be increased. This is not a new creation. Successive governments have also tried to draft various plans, but they have all been unsuccessful due to financial constraints. The current government's budget for the implementation of this matter is more than 300 million lire. The initial work has now been successful, and all of Italy's slightly barren land has been cultivated. As for those infertile lands, methods such as fertilization and irrigation are also used to make them suitable for cultivation. The remaining undeveloped areas can also be plowed and cultivated after various engineering equipment is complete. In total, the increase in Italian fertile land has reached 8,500,000 mu in the ten years that the Fascist Party has been in power. From this number, we can get a glimpse of its achievements.</p>
<p>As for the reclamation of swamp areas and waterlogged wetlands, it is also one of the important plans. Italy has been forced to increase its population, and forests and trees have been cut down, resulting in flash floods in mountainous areas and frequent floods, while fertile plains are often submerged by water and turned into swamps. This development plan covers an area of 167,000 mu, part of which is entirely water sludge, which is a base camp for breeding poisonous mosquitoes, often spreading plagues to residents in nearby villages and towns. As for those swamp ponds that are above the water surface and deep in the mountains, they cannot be reclaimed due to the pervasive miasma.</p>
<p>In the past, popes also invested in reclaiming these areas, but because the planes of those swamps were often uneven and there was a lack of pumping stations, the entire cost often fell into nothing, achieving nothing. However, these problems have been solved very quickly and effectively by the engineers in the current revitalization movement. They have dug many drainage ditches with appropriate capacity and slope: and in necessary places, many pumping stations have been built, all of which are managed by electric motors, so that the flooding of large water can be prevented.</p>
<p>The work of developing these wetlands began two years ago and is now mostly completed. The former plague-spreading, disorganized swamps have now mostly become solid farmhouses or other buildings with a width of 60 to 100 mu! People can claim it as their own as long as they pay a considerable land price. Those farmhouses are enough for a large family to use, and they are equipped with stables for pigs, cows, horses, and poultry. As for the output of agricultural products, there has also been a huge increase. Barley, wheat, oats, corn, and other grains and various fruits and vegetables are produced everywhere. Before the reclamation, the total number of residents in these areas was only 1,900. Now there are 50,000 people and their families, hoping to live permanently in this peaceful environment. The government has also established many towns in appropriate locations, each with a church, a hospital, and a school, and of course, in addition to many shops and hotels, there is also a cinema.</p>
<p>In addition, there are 13,000 people engaged in this work, which can also be regarded as a small remedy for the wave of industrial layoffs!</p>
<h3>The Necessary Concept</h3>
<p>— Wind</p>
<p>(1) Literature is Not Something Mysterious</p>
<p>"What is literature?" There are far too many answers to this question. However, the explanation given by Plekhanov contains more correct elements and is generally regarded as an axiom or common sense:</p>
<p>"Art is the expression (or, more accurately, the reflection) of human emotions and thoughts. However, this expression is not abstract but uses vivid images. This is the main characteristic of art. People are influenced by the reality surrounding them, which rekindles the emotions and thoughts they have experienced internally, and then they express these emotions and thoughts in certain images. This is art."</p>
<p>Needless to say, literature is an art that expresses itself using words as its specific image.</p>
<p>In other words: "Literature is a kind of social phenomenon, a reflection of the superstructure ideology. When we examine the development of literature, we must base it on the changes in the entire social structure and never treat literature as something detached from the basic social structure, transcendent, and unique. The development of past societies, based on different modes of social production, can be divided into:</p>
<p>Ancient society, feudal society, and capitalist society. The development of literature can also be divided into: ancient society literature, feudal society literature, and capitalist literature, according to the stage of social development." There is no creator beyond everything in the world. Literature cannot be without earthly concerns; it cannot become a bubble floating outside the sphere of social activities. Even those who sing the praises of art above all else and hold mysterious views, the mysterious views in their minds are also products of society and have their social basis. In the final analysis, there is nothing mysterious about it.</p>
<p>This is a necessary concept for those who are starting to study literature.</p>
<p>(2) "Prejudice" in Literature</p>
<p>Since literature is a very ordinary thing in which people are influenced by the reality around them, rekindling the emotions and thoughts they have experienced internally and then expressing them through the images of words, naturally, it is not an abstract thing without content. It must consciously or unconsciously represent a worldview and a philosophy of life. That is, it must represent a kind of prejudice in the competition of real life, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>This kind of "prejudice" becomes the marrow of the work. The success of good literary works lies not only in the form. The beauty of words, the beauty of tone, and the beauty of structural expression, although necessary conditions for literature, are not the ultimate determining factors. The first thing we must grasp is the idea—this kind of prejudice.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, there has never been a completely "neutral" work without prejudice since ancient times. The so-called pure art, its ivory tower, is its prejudice.</p>
<p>It still advocates maintaining the safety of the ivory tower, and it is clear that it sympathizes with and supports a prevailing ideology.</p>
<p>Social consciousness is a kind of imprint, and it will inevitably and fairly be stamped on every work.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first thing that people engaged in literary research should pay attention to is what idea a work represents. Whether it is a poem, a novel, a play, or even a short piece of writing, it cannot be easily let go. One cannot simply indulge in the words of the work, or pay attention to its tone, or savor its structure, or admire its expression.</p>
<p>These beautiful clothes can sometimes cover up its original appearance, but careful readers can still see its original form.</p>
<p>Without understanding the idea of a work, one cannot talk about literature at all.</p>
<p>(3) The Educational Function of Literature</p>
<p>No matter how you deny the so-called "utilitarian" view, saying that literature is for people to appreciate and has no other function; no matter how you extol the supremacy of art, the independence and transcendence of art, the fact is that literature itself fulfills the task of education. Whether you are conscious or unconscious, whether you admit it or not.</p>
<p>A person's thoughts are often so influenced by a work that there is a world of difference between their before and after. Many people move forward because of this, and many people fall and become decadent because of this. Since ancient times, there have been articles praising merits and virtues, as well as satires, resistance, rebellion, and unrighteous creations. They are all representing a prejudice to educate the public. This is not a new discovery, it has been the case since ancient times. The reason why literature can become the greatest weapon of education is because it does not directly appeal to reason, but integrates reason and emotion, turning it into a concrete flame that burns your soul. In this, you can recognize a bigger world, comprehend all kinds of lives, enlighten your intelligence, and recognize your life. The effect of a poem or a tragedy is sometimes better than a chapter of religious preaching or a scientific principle. It has infinite power to make you its prisoner without any complaints.</p>
<p>Many people recognize life in real life and social sciences. There are also many people who first engage in literature and then feel the importance of social sciences, turning to or simultaneously studying social sciences.</p>
<p>Therefore, studying literature should not be approached with an attitude of leisure and entertainment, but to obtain what you are looking for in this process and to train yourself in this process.</p>
<p>This is a corner of knowledge that we want to explore.</p>
<p>(4) Literature is Not the Profession of Literati</p>
<p>Since the division of physical labor and mental labor and their development into opposition, with the evolution of production relations, the latter has monopolized the entire field of knowledge, and naturally, literature has become the profession of literati.</p>
<p>Due to the accumulation of past literary heritage, today, literature, like other arts, has rich, complex, and beautiful experiences and techniques in expression. These elements cannot be easily dabbled in by those who have not received considerable education. Moreover, as the division of labor in society becomes more refined, writers have become a profession for a portion of the most outstanding mental laborers. In capitalist society, although a portion of the lower-level laborers also have the opportunity to receive elementary education, there are still very few farmer-workers who can emerge from this.</p>
<p>In general, people roughly believe that "If one is not a scholar, one should not show off one's skill before an expert!" Even very rich in literary thought, they can speak very rich in literary interest, but he does not engage in writing.</p>
<p>This is a prejudice, an inherited prejudice, which is a major loss to the literary garden.</p>
<p>Now, we want to break this inherited view.</p>
<p>We read literary works and study literature, and at the same time, we also propose that we should start writing. If we have no feelings and thoughts, then so be it, but if we do, we can write them out. We want to learn writing techniques, but technique is not the main body of literature, it is just a means of expression.</p>
<p>Since literary appreciation is not limited to the profession of literati, literary creation is naturally no exception. We want to make the literary garden richer, and we need to know the truth of the intimate lives written by people from all social strata. This is also the concept that our amateur readers should have, hoping to use their spare time to write as well.</p>
<p>(5) Our Starting Point is Concrete and Modern Literature</p>
<p>The above concepts provide a more accurate orientation for those who are beginning to engage in literary research. When engaging in the study of a subject, if one makes a mistake at the starting point, then all of their subsequent efforts will be wasted, which is very important. The following will also explain why we limit the scope of research only to the modern cross-section.</p>
<p>First, our starting point of research should be a concrete crystal of social ideology. Then, this crystal is, of course, the society we currently live in. We cannot take the crystal of social consciousness that is far away from the present as the starting point.</p>
<p>Second, modern social life is relatively easier to understand, and there is naturally a stronger interest in modern literary works. Therefore, we start with what we can easily understand.</p>
<p>Third, because of modern life, we really have a thorough need to understand it. For our own lives, we should expand our knowledge and educate ourselves from literature.</p>
<p>Fourth, we are all amateur readers and do not have enough free time to study ancient times; ancient times that are too far away from our needs.</p>
<p>Fifth, studying knowledge from top to bottom is certainly a method, but studying from bottom to top is also a good method. After we understand this stage, if we want to improve ourselves, we have this kind of foundation, and naturally, we can go back up and study them one by one.</p>
<h3>On How to Strengthen the Foundation of Labor-Capital Cooperation?</h3>
<p>— Steel</p>
<p>In today's situation where the feelings between labor and capital are deteriorating day by day, in addition to the authorities bearing the responsibility, each of us should be equally concerned about the issue of strikes! Therefore, we need to examine the causes and effects of each labor-capital confrontation, and the methods used by our factory owners, to increase our mutual experience and strengthen the foundation of labor-capital cooperation.</p>
<p>The method is the skill of handling affairs. Whether a career can succeed depends entirely on the quality of handling affairs skills. Historically, many disputes were caused by clumsy handling, leading to irrecoverable chaos. However, even now, most people still follow the old ways and are unwilling to wake up and seek progress in handling affairs methods. Therefore, in recent years, labor-capital disputes have emerged endlessly in every factory. Strike waves have risen one after another, and have been unstoppable, creating today's embarrassing situation.</p>
<p>In such a situation, the factory should bear full responsibility; and the government also cannot escape its blame. Allowing the factory to act willfully, follow the old ways, and not strive to improve the methods of managing workers, and still adopt a consistent strong and hardline policy, constantly arousing workers' resentment. For example, the reason for a certain factory's strike was that it consistently adopted this policy to suppress workers, ordered patrols to shoot workers, and even arrested workers' representatives. The clumsiness of this handling method is truly shocking, and it is clear that the outcome of the incident is to increase the opposition between labor and capital!</p>
<p>Fortunately, the factory owners who adopt this clumsy method and are not good at controlling workers are not the case for the whole situation. Occasionally, a few wise men can use more advanced methods. For example, a certain cannery is indeed very considerate in its response to workers. For example, when there are lazy workers who do not work well, or unfaithful elements, it can use very sufficient reasons, such as a certain machine or room in the factory being damaged and urgently needing repair, etc., without publicizing it, and individually distribute wages, and instruct them to stop working temporarily, and notify them to come to the factory to work after the factory is repaired. Using this advanced method, although more than two hundred people were laid off last year due to various unavoidable reasons (the total number of people in the entire factory is said to be only more than two hundred), the performance of both labor and capital was still very harmonious, with no negative reactions.</p>
<p>From this, we can know that the method of using workers must strive for improvement, so that at least the index of strikes can be reduced. The above-mentioned new advanced method is at least worthy of our deep attention. And that clumsy and outdated method must be sent into the grave!</p>

<h3>Eliminating Disasters and Prolonging Life Not For Parents Kalachakra Dharma Assembly Fully Disrupting Order is a Monk</h3>
<p>— Songjie</p>
<p>(1) ············· (1)</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence</p>
<p>In various newspapers, there were large advertisements soliciting donations. The Kalachakra Dharma Assembly in Hangzhou once caused a sensation for thousands of people to participate in. I can be considered "destined" to attend the grand event in person and be guided by the "Guru" to go to the "Tantra City" for "initiation". To be honest, the first day I went to participate, I was there to watch the excitement. The second day I went to do something with a friend by appointment. I arrived at Lingyin Temple at four o'clock and still had to listen to the Dharma for two hours. The third day I bought things for my friend and only sent them there at four-thirty, and I was able to participate in the grand event of circling the "Tantra City" and listened to a speech by the Panchen Lama on the essentials of Buddhism, which made me have a more intimate understanding of Buddhism, and I was deeply honored. Not daring to keep it secret, I especially mention it to the readers of the Amateur Weekly, considering that I am taking time out of my busy schedule to represent everyone in participating.</p>
<p>(2) ·············· (2)</p>
<p>When I rushed there on the first day, it gave me many unpleasant impressions. First, there were soldiers and police standing guard in the field, with shining guns and swords. Second, the order was too chaotic. The reasons for this are: 1. There was no organization for distributing "Dharma objects". The host should have divided it into several groups and posted notices all over the field, instructing the recipients not to compete. However, the organizers had neither this experience nor a way to avoid people competing. They should have checked all the items to be distributed, bundled them together, and distributed them when entering the field, so as not to disturb the order when "preaching the Dharma". The delivery of "Dharma water" was also not arranged for each group to be held in each row at the same time, and everyone was afraid of not getting it. 2. There were too many people with red strips, flowing back and forth in the field, speaking loudly. Those "monks" were even more disruptors of order. 3. The translator was from Xikang and spoke Sichuan Mandarin. Without re-translation by people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the audience did not understand and did not feel interested, thus shaking their "devotion". Third, those with neat clothing were allowed to enter the field even without tickets, while the hardworking workers and peasants were obstructed in many ways, even if there were many empty seats in the field, they were not allowed to enter. Those on the altar were all figures of a certain special class. It seemed that the Buddha Dharma was not equal. Fourth, most of the "longevity" tablets prayed for "themselves" to "eliminate disasters and prolong life", and less than one or two tenths prayed on behalf of their parents. Only three tablets were noteworthy:</p>
<p>1. The position of loyal and righteous souls who were killed in the defense of the country over the years.</p>
<p>2. Special recommendation for the officers and soldiers who died in the January 28 Incident in Shanghai in Xinwei Renshen and the loyal souls who were killed.</p>
<p>3. Special recommendation for the deceased officers and soldiers who have been suppressed over the years.</p>
<p>At that time, I had a strange idea when I saw it: If this Dharma Assembly were held in Japan, what would happen? Ha! Ha!</p>
