<h3>時評</h3>
<p>由中意通使説到使節升格問題　廷</p>
<p>意大利政府最近擢升駐華使館。表示其承認中國爲一大國特加重視而我國亦有將駐意使館迅卽升格之準備。</p>
<p>考諸史乘中意通使背景特殊蓋西洋使節之首入中國者。實來自大秦其時則爲後漢柜帝延　九年去今已一千七百六十有八年矣。大秦卽古羅馬。而古羅馬則今日意大利前身也。</p>
<p>顧我國與羅馬之交通雖早。而派遣常駐使節。則甫起於遜清之末葉光緒七年。（一八八一）李鳳苞氏兼充駐意荷奥三國公使是爲中國派使駐意之始。自彼迄今。又五十有三年。乃有互派大使之舉。</p>
<p>據一八一五年維也納會議之决議惟大使有代表其國元首本身之資格。是以位尊望重。異乎尋常。至其所享特權。則有實質的與形式的之分前者謂其有逕與駐在國元首而商公事及隨時覲見之特權。後者謂其在捧呈國書時得受特殊之禮遇。在平時有充任使團領袖等之優先權也。</p>
<p>顧時至今日。所謂形式的特權。固無關於宏旨。卽實質的特權。亦已無何重大之價值可言。蓋立憲國家之外交大權。多操在外交部長之手。其手本方針。且往往爲立法機關所左右。是以一國元首個人之口頭約諾。决不足以搆成國家之行爲。縱將使節升格。亦無多補。按諸中意現行政制。兩國元首。皆不負實際行政之責。今後必不致因使節升格而另闢外交折衝之新蹊徑殆可斷言。然則指使節升格爲兩國關係接近之一表徵。容或近情。謂將因此舉動而開創兩國特殊親交之局面。則未免有因果顛倒及言過其實之嫌也。</p>
<p>中外使節之升格。在前有蘇俄開先例。在今有意國步後塵。英美日法德諸國。經此衝動。頗有繼起接洽之可能。卽我方暫守沈默。而各國若竟向我提議。則其勢亦正難拒。於是乃有實際問題之發生。其一日經費。其二日人選請分論之。</p>
<p>（一）古時歐洲各國之遣使也。僅有大使一級。然以各國崇尚虚榮。相互爭勝。及其流弊則由使節之迎送派遣而養成繁文縟節窮奢極侈之風氣。小國力不勝任。始知仰低品級。籍省糜費。此殆普通使節之所由設也。我國自鼎革以還。出使人員向稱清苦。卽如本年度之外交經費。僅佔國家普通歲出經常費百分之五，六三。而其間使領館經費。與二十年度預算相比較。且减少一百九十餘萬元之鉅。今後一旦將駐在各主要國之使節。一一升格卽言館舍之設置裝飾一項所費已屬不貲不幸而升格爲名。寒酸其實則適足騰笑異邦。重貽國家之羞耳。美國於開始派遣大使之前。卽以經費困難。而屢提屢輟。我國而果有擢升駐外重要使館之决心。要不可不預籌充分之經費。而確保其用途。</p>
<p>（二）使才之難自古同然。此孔子所以有（誦詩三百不能專對。雖多亦奚以爲）之嘆。我國外交陣容之破碎自國難而愈顯。使才殘缺。何可諱言。英國外交家前輩山斗氏嘗日。（使者宜具良好之性情。健全之體格。都麗之儀容。卽無絶世之聰。亦須過人之智。善長文學。兼博史事。且富判斷力。）今試懸此爲</p>
<p>遴使之標鵠。環顧國内能膺其選者。有幾人乎。而况以大使之尊。又非普通使節所得而同日語也。嘗聞駐美施使數語其屬員云。（我國之使館。或不難升格。惟堪充大使才者。將安的求之。）施使固爲外交老手其言若是。自非泛泛者可比也。今日因駐意使館之升格。其所關大使人選。不過一人。則遴擇也猶易。且聞政府已經物色有人。自能應肆裕如。惟此後其他繼起之人選。則應嚴限其資格學問禀賦操守。務自末秩遞升。循階而上。果能本此標準而悉心栽培。期以十年至二十年。則使才輩出矣。</p>
<p>總之意政府擢升其駐華使節。以表示其尊重中國之好意。自爲吾人所感謝。而我國政府當局。對於此舉曾作相當之努力。亦爲時勢所必需。使節升格。果何所補於實際。固爲一擬問。但假定政府當局果本此方針而行。則不可不就經費與人選二項。鄭重考慮。以圖久遠。與其因草率從事百追悔於後。則母寗愼重於前之爲愈也。</p>

<h3>颶風席捲關西的大災（日本通信）</h3>
<p>風速六十米</p>
<p>受害七府縣</p>
<p>九月二十一日晨八時光景、大阪市上空颶風襲來、（風速在三十米以上者卽爲颶風）其速度最小的有四十米、最大的有六十米、是關東大地震以來最厲害的天災、當颶風襲來的時候、同時海潮高漲、濁流十尺、兇湧於沿岸各區、當地住民震於風害、又遭水淹、父子相失、夫婦離散、房屋倒塌、交通全斷、過了十點之後、疾風漸去、可是錦綉繁華、烟突林立、足稱日本工業中心的大阪、轉瞬間竟變作了風與水的阿鼻地獄、</p>
<p>據事後調查、受災的地方最甚的是大阪、其次京都、又次兵庫·高知·鳥取·愛媛·岡山等縣、颶風發生的時候、正是學校上課時間、而一般學校又修造得極不堅固、所以容易倒壞、此次學校建築物倒塌了的、計一百四十六所死亡五二八人、連受傷和失蹤的教員學生算起來、一共有二千二百四十五人、住宅全倒的有四千一百三十五户、連半倒的合計起來有一萬二千二百五十五户、非住宅全倒和半倒的合計有一萬六千五百六十五家、還有寺社官衙等受災的也有四十所、總計傷亡人數有四千六百五十、市内電車被吹翻一輛、火車三輛、大小船隻流失一千六百二十七隻、</p>
<p>京都府死傷一千五百人、房屋倒壞共二千六百家、漂流與被水淹的一千七百餘户、</p>
<p>兵庫縣被水淹的家屋四萬二千、倒塌的一千六百七十七户、堤防損壞一四六處、傷亡六百餘人、山崩三處、輪船遭難的十七艘、漁船二千二百隻、其餘各縣受災比較輕、不細述、</p>
<p>大阪是日本的工業區、而（此花區）、（大正區）、（港區）又是大阪的工業地帶、各工廠莫不遭重大損害、但是工廠的結構很複雜、尤其是軍事工業、要詳實計算是很不容易的、何况這當中還有一種特殊的秘密軍事關係、不過就大體上估計、上述各地區工塲方面的損失、至少會有三萬萬元日金以上、在此花區被水淹的工塲、如液體空氣、東洋木材防腐、（漂流損失）大阪鐵、住友伸銅鋼管、住友製鋼、住友電綫、日本染料、大阪製鐵、富土製紙、安治川鐵工、東亞鐵工、大阪帶革、高田製藥、大日本人造肥料等等、多半是和軍需工業有關係的、大正區一帶被水淹的有東洋紡續、豐田織機鑄物、福安鋼管、大阪製鐵條、中山製鐵、帝國人造肥料、户畑鑄造等工塲、淹水的有八百所、其他小工塲四百餘所、尼崎所屬工塲有八十所被水淹没、生産機能差不多全部停滯、軍需工業自然要受影響、卽輸出方面也會受打擊、</p>
<p>總括全體的損失、恐怕會超過五萬萬日金、這様的天災不能説是小、可是我們回想關東大地震的時候、東京·横濱·等重要都市的損失、數在一百萬萬日金以上、占全日本國富的十分之一、然而五年之後、就漸見恢復、大阪這一次的風災、誠然是很大、民間受害自然也很深、甚到會影響到整個日本的國力亦未可知、這中間却有幾件值得我們注意的事、第一是大阪市政府救災的手段非常敏速、警察的活動、調查災區異常迅速、收容難民也很週到、而市政府立卽撥欵九十萬元作應急的開支、還算應該作的事、而民間捐欵救濟、住友系財閥、住友吉左衛門捐資百萬元從事救助、已經是難能可貴了、而大阪朝日新聞社一家報館、在三日之間、卽集捐二十六萬餘元、由此可見日人救災之踴躍、及舉國赴難之精神、咬緊牙關往前奮鬥、以期戰勝自然力、確是值得我們注意、西望萬方多難的祖國同胞、應更加倍的奮勉纔是啊、（九月二十四日於大阪北區）</p>
<h3>美記者團與日陸相談日軍駐滿問題</h3>
<p>美記者認與僞滿獨立矛盾</p>
<p>林陸相諉在現狀下不能撤</p>
<p>二十三日日本名古屋新聞載稱、美國新聞記者團羅威爾梅立德等十人、抵東京後、於二十二日午後二時五十分、訪問林陸相、由本元貞翻譯、與林陸相談話約一小時、大略情形如下、（一）美記者德拉蒙問日、吾輩新聞團全體意思、對於日本軍隊之永遠駐屯滿洲、認爲與（滿洲國）獨立性質、大相矛盾、林陸相答稱、日本軍之駐屯滿洲、係因目下全滿洲、之盜匪、出没</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>無常、而滿洲軍隊、尚無抑制之能力、且内治國防、又未安固、故在此現狀之下、日軍之駐滿、自屬必需、（二）美記者白英特問日、照閣下意見觀察、日軍之駐滿、究至將來如何程度、方能撤退乎、林答稱、俟國内平定、滿洲軍隊之力、足以對抗外敵爲止、余意該滿洲軍之訓練、尚須相當之時期、日本軍之撤退、至短尚須在一二年之後、（三）白氏又問日、日軍之撤退滿洲時期、日本政府竟不能預先確定乎、林答稱、由日滿兩國共同防衛之立塲、須得日（滿）兩國雙方一致之意見、方能决定也、</p>
<h3>冀省戰區整理問題</h3>
<p>整理委員會短期内可成立</p>
<p>宫越案與勦匪應付尚困難</p>
<p>北平通信、關於（戰區）整理問題、自當局决定組織（戰區）整理委員會後、組織方案曁委員人選、平政整會委員長黄郛、業經有所擬定、頃據官方消息、短期内卽可宣告成立、委員名單、届時卽由政整會以訓令方式公布、額數多寡、頃雖無從臆測、但由軍分會·政整會·冀省府·灤榆區公署·薊密區公署·察省府·北寗路局等七機關、推派代表組織之、則爲事實、</p>
<p>至言戰區問題、目前有兩事、殊使當軸者昕夕未容少息身心、卽玉田宫越案之應付、與夫玉田縣股匪竄擾之剿辦、關於前者、宫越誤被殺害眞相、雖經中日雙方會同查明、但日方以宫越係駐馬蘭峪日軍之買辦爲理由、表示不能與遷安福山寺事件相提並論、</p>
<p>後者、（戰區）内之匪、我方因種種事實上之顧慮、及所謂非武裝區之特殊情形、施行剿辦、曲折甚多、覘夫去年秋間老耗子盤踞撫寗縣一事、卽可考證今日之玉田股匪、我方欲予卽事痛剿、實際上之難爲何如、此種見解、殆已不可諱言、故官方認爲一方面使（戰區）内不幸事件、杜絶於未來、（戰區）内之匪源、能使一廓而清、厥非（戰區）整理早日實施不爲功、</p>
<p>黄氏對宫越案之應付對策、昨（二十六）晚今（二十七）晨、曾召見李擇一有所商談、迄午已有相常决演、李於當日下午四時許、卽離平赴津、據探悉、該案將由李與日方開始折衝、一般人推想、認爲經一度交涉後、卽可得到相當結果、事態决不致擴大也、</p>
<p>關於剿擊玉田股匪問題、當局亦有所决定、其步驟當然先使（戰區）整理委員會提早成立、以便着手實施整理、（戰區）旣能着手整理、則三數百之股匪、自是不難剿擊以致肅清、（戰區）内能整理就緒、則一切糾葛、當然减少、關係方面表示、玉田宫越事件、不難解决、玉田股匪、亦不難剿辦、惟胥視日方能否誠意的履行諾言、對我實施整理（戰區）之工作、不加阻力、以使事竟全功耳、（二十七日）</p>
<h3>冀省遵玉交界匪警</h3>
<p>匪携有重火器</p>
<p>燒殺各村甚慘</p>
<p>天津通信、河北省府、今日得玉田縣長陳寳生、遵化縣長申鐘獄、來電報告、略稱二十四日午後三時、有土匪一股、約三百餘名、由薊縣界山口竄到玉田·遵化·交界、在大小李莊盤踞、燒殺掠擄、姦淫婦女、附近十餘村、皆罹匪刧、各村民被匪禁閉外出、匪挨户令指獻財物、村民有冒險逃出者、到遵化縣城報告、縣長申鐘獄、乃親率保衛隊第三區長馬鑑池·區隊長孫英、恊助戰區保安第三大隊王占元部、於是日午後六時、馳往圍勦、同時玉田縣薊縣民團、亦各派出隊伍前往堵擊、當晚七時、開始接獨、匪衆因有迫擊砲兩門、山砲二門、機關槍數挺、大小槍枝齊備、抗拒不退、并以焚燬全村、威脅國警不得進攻、民團警察集結千餘人、激戰一夜、迄二十五日上午七時許、匪衆不支、乃向燕山口方面退、王占元部保安隊、卽在後跟踪尾追、省府另據報告、此一股土匪、仍爲石友三劉桂堂秘密集結之僞部、故其器械逈非普通土匪精鈍不齊可比、匪衆的有之重火器、除機關槍爲石劉補充者外、迫擊砲·山砲·則係熱河張海鵬部僞軍譁變時携出、由石劉誘致加入匪股者、省府當電薊·遵·遷·玉·豐·五縣、上緊搜勦、以期撲滅、</p>
<p>撫寗縣境東南二十里地方、二十四日亦發現槍械整齊之匪衆、傳亦係石友三劉桂堂舊部、經保安第一總隊長嶁毓英、派隊搜勦、捕得其渠魁王某、夥匪十餘、餘衆則逃散、不知去向、其他戰區内各縣、亦發現名爲僞部某軍某旅之匪衆多股、竄擾不定、當局恐再有去年戚文平老耗子匪警事件發生於灤東、所以密飭省編三個保安總隊·及各縣民團書隊、一體嚴密境内防務、昨又聞劉桂堂石友三暗遣多人、沿北寗鐵路綫、遍設僞軍辦事處、爲情報及聯絡工作、其設立所在、皆在日韓浪人販毒品之洋行内、當局已飭各地負責機關、秘密查報、以便預防、聞石友三頃擬隨川島芳子及某日人、日内赴長春、向僞組織有所接洽、（二十五日）</p>
<h3>冀省戰區之僞團體</h3>
<p>官廳不能干涉</p>

<p>蔣委員長倡導組織之中國糧食運銷局、在滬成立籌備處、已積極進行、茲悉此項糧運局、刻已停止籌辦、改由中央另行組織全國糧食運銷局、所有以前經收各省繳納之股欵、卽如數撥還各省市、茲悉資本額業已决定增加爲四百萬元、將由中央銀行先行借撥的欵成立、茲誌前後詳情如次、</p>
<p>電文一束</p>
<p>（一）中國糧食運銷局籌備處主任顧馨一呈蔣委員長電文、查行政院臨時會議議决、一尅日成立糧食局、歸財政部主辦一等因、是本處籌備工作、自應尅日停止、以一事權至本處以前經收各省繳納之股欵、亦擬如數撥發、以清手續、（二）蔣委員長電行政院云、查中國糧食運銷局籌備處成立以來、迭經電催各省市政府、遵繳股欵在案現在旣經行政院議决由政府設立歸財政部主辦、該主任等呈請停止籌備工作、照事權並撥還各省市已繳股欵、以便結束一節、自應照准、除指令遵照、並請速飭財政部成立糧食運銷局、</p>
<p>改組原因</p>
<p>中國糧食運銷局之籌設動機、係八省之代表爲謀救濟農邨、發展糧食業務而設、於去年十一月間在滬成立籌備處、由籌備主任顧馨一負責進行、决定股欵爲二百萬元、由官商雙方負其半、定於本年一月前集股、但迄至上月、各省糧食商尚未繳齊、以致遲遲不能成立、前月行政院臨時會議、亦以各地旱災奇重、急應成立糧食運銷局、藉謀救濟、而便穏定市價、經决議將已在籌備之中國糧食運銷局撤銷、飭由財政部另行設立、以促實現、　　財部主辦</p>
<p>財政部長孔祥熙、於接奉蔣委員長電後、亦以當此農村破産之際、糧食運銷局、實有擴大之必要、庶可謀救濟、前糧食運銷局官方資本祗一百萬元、實不濟於事、現旣改歸政府設立、故擬增加資本爲四百萬元、同時再行擴大組織、在各地徧設糧食運銷局分處、普遍設立新式之農村倉庫、則於大豐之年、生産過剩時、收買入倉、不致穀賤傷農、若值如今歲之旱災時、農家歉收、庫中則出剩米以調劑之、如是則可穏定市價不致再被奸商有所壟斷也、</p>
<p>急促成立</p>
<p>孔氏爲欲促其早日成立計、曾乎諭最近在京成立之籌備處加緊工作、積極進行、據華東社記者昨向有關方面探悉、籌備事宜、大致已告就緒、並已派員赴湘鄂皖各地調查實况、並爲預防各地發生災荒計、特分别另派專員、赴漢口、長沙·等各重要産米區域視察、俾着手建築、積儲倉庫、至該局内部組織及工作人員、亦已内定、所有全部經費、亦經核准、一旦成立、即可由中央銀行先行借撥云、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二回　作賈入民間路回永壽别家來天上人到長安</p>
<p>所謂汽車站，你會好笑，原來是把店門放寛一點，可以讓汽車閒了進來。在院子裏將幾間土屋子　通了，向外的牆壁汽車就可以開到屋子下去。屋子旣没有了，院子後面，乃是壁立的土坡，開了幾個，半橢圓的窟　，這窟　裏就是窰洞。不用得説進去安歇，就是在外面站着，裏面黑洞洞的，也送了一種難聞的氣味出來。但是不進去，却又没有第二個地方可以歇脚。没有法子，只好硬了心腸，把行李搬將進去。好在我帶有行軍床，在土坑上支起來睡。總算四面不沾土。到了吃飯，可又發生問題，在乾州一帶，猪肉鷄蛋兩様東西，總可以買到的。可是這兩様，這裏全没有。所幸這店裏還剩有一二十　黑麵　，可以讓給我吃。我就説没有菜也不要緊，買點白糖來醮黑　吃罷。我把這話和店夥一商量，他笑了起起，説是要吃白糖，還得跑回去二十里，到監軍鎭去買。我想，一個正工縣城，豈有白糖都買不到之理，我就疑心這是店夥瞎説的。到了次日，我一早起來，就進城去看看。那裏知道這城外十幾户人家，却是全縣精華所在。城裏是一條大道，在兩座土山中間。那城墻，有一塊没一塊，圈了半個土山頭，比我在河南所看到的鄉下大寨子還要小。爬上土山，向全城一看，高高低低，在山坡上種了些麥田。北邊有兩户人家，是高等小學校，和守城軍的連部。南邊有兩户人家，一個是荒蕪了的舊縣衙門。一個是城隍廟。此外便是幾個宦窰洞了。據我事後調查，本城連陰陽衙門在内，一共是八户。（二八）</p>
<h3>書包</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>咱們中國，究竟是文墨之邦，所以就是（書包）一項，也有各種不同的方式，以及其變遷與演進的歷史。</p>
<p>唐宋元明時代的書包，是怎麽様的一副嘴臉，我是耳未聞，目未見，不敢胡説亂道，但在道咸同光年間，我們的祖老太爺與老太爺所用的，據説是一方四方尺大小的藍布，和一根藍布帶而已。</p>
<p>這種書包，現在是已絶迹了，就是上古物陳列館内，怕也找不到了。到了我們念書的時代，藍布書包，是不用了，炒米色的羽毛紗，把書裏着，用别針一·鈕夾在脅下，是挺時髦不過的。這是清末民初的書包。</p>
<p>鼎革之後，書包也起了革命，不用包袱式的，而改用書包皮帶了，狹狹的一根皮帶，徿住了書籍，皮帶裏的甚麽書，誰都可瞧一個清透。於是乎誰都愛夾上幾本洋裝書，以示形容不出的光榮。</p>
<p>書包皮帶，是最適用於中大學生，所以小學生，都用一個郵差用的信袋那麽的書包，一則取其便利，二則取其可以使人瞧不見裏面藏的甚麽書。</p>
<p>書包皮帶落伍了，於是小小的手提箱，取得了書包的地位，不論是何程度的學生，一律改用小提箱，更其是女生們愛用，因爲在裏面，可藏充量的化裝品。</p>
<p>但是現代的大學生們，都把公事皮包，當作書包用了。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （劍芬）</p>
<p>（求學）好像是在吃橄欖，起初的滋味是苦澀的，但繼苦澀而來的，是説不出的甜味。</p>
<p>在做事的時候，常常要感到自已的學識不够應用；然而當（求學）的時候，往往又覺得（求學）是一椿討厭的事。</p>
<h3>紹興婦女的孝髻</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>一到了紹興，首先使人觸目的是家家門前的糞缸和封建時代的殘留物，像什麽（大夫第）、（兄弟同科）等等的匾額。其次，就要推到婦女的教髻了。</p>
<p>紹興婦女，剪髮的本不多。伊們頭背後，總各有一個圓圓的髻兒還保留着的。這是指不穿孝的婦女而説。如果是穿孝的，伊們便在髻兒外面，密繞以白頭繩，并且紥得有條不紊。這種白髻，本没有什麽奇怪，在杭州等處也看得到的。所觸目的，紹興婦女的孝髻上面，還紥有一個半環，顫巍巍地高聳於頭部之上。從背後望去，整個的白髻，好像是一面小鑼；那半環，好像是鑼上穿着的繩子，空中有手在提着。</p>
<p>這白髻上的半環，不知有何用處。若説爲美觀計，似乎又不然。據我想來，這恐怕還是從前婦女爲俘虜品時候的遺跡罷。婦女在從前，向來被男女們視爲同畜類一様，可以任意掠奪的。掠奪起來，拉手拖脚，自然不行；那末，只好拖頭髮了。後來男子乖巧，覺得拖頭髮也不是事，於是把婦女的頭髮打成一個圓結兒。這様，或提或拖，似覺便利得多。這和我們買了一只鷄或鴨，握牢它的翅膀，覺得累墜，倒不如用根草繩，把它的兩脚一縛，一端再打上一個圓結兒，就可倒提在手中一様的便當相同。久而久之，婦女也自忘伊們頭髻上的圓結是供男子們掠奪用的，所以倒把它梳得格外整齊，像現在紹興所見的孝髻一般了。</p>
<p>以上是我的臆測，不知道對不對。如果是不錯的話，那末做婦女的，眞正是可憐極了。至於不穿孝的婦女，伊們的髻上爲什麽没加上一個半環，這想就是（物各有主）的標記罷。</p>
<h3>學生三部曲之三（大學時代）</h3>
<h3>觀於日滿企業之感言（下）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>不食不衣則凍餒而死，但有衣食之源，生生不息，則子孫遞嬗以承其業，亦即可以生生不息無有窮期，飛機炸彈雖能殺人毁物而不能絶我人種，滅我生機，又何懼哉？人心不死，即無往而不生，哀莫大於心死、而今之人，一心只向死路求生，而又昧於求生之道，舍本求末，是直所謂死症而已。春秋欄之點滴，有人謂禮義廉恥，固定是救世靈方，特惜有方無藥，殊不知藥物，本來充塞於宇宙之問，只待人去采用，猶之五穀六畜，雖是天生，亦待人養，不此之求，而必如秦皇之向海外求仙，縱能辟穀成仙，然而尸解之後，靈魂不死，神仙又想下凡，仍不過爲循環之輙，是故物極必反，乃必然之理，禮義廉恥，自從近世年來，已到消滅凈盡之極地，則如夏至陰生，冬至陽生之例，亦固其宜，若以藥方爲比，則中西醫理，本無二致，不過知其然而不知所然者多耳。日人之營東北，正以我國之方，利用我山中地下之藥物，以救其國之貧病，而我必求海外仙方，覔我所無之藥物，轉以我所有之藥物，以供人之予取予求，吾誠百思而不得一解，因該數行之報，引起無限之感想，拉雜書此，聊以供春秋之筆削，亦以遺我涯之生而已。</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>怎様除去衣上的汚點</h3>
<p>— 青莊</p>
<p>倘使不留神在衣服上着了汚點，心裏一定非常難過的吧，現在我來告訴諸位一種輕便的去除這汚點的方法。</p>
<p>汚點倘使經過的時日太長久了的話，那末就難以完全除去了；只能够使他淡薄混過人們的眼睛，所以要除去汚點，最好是一着就做，否則怕就難能了。</p>
<p>除去的方法不外二種，就是機械的，和化學的；化學的方法中，又可分爲乾燥法和濕潤法，乾燥法所用的揮發性藥品，最好和纖維及染上的色彩要没有妨礙才好。</p>
<p>現在把所着汚點的種類，和除去的方法寫在下面；丨丨</p>
<p>油漬　油類和脂肪等汚點，往往是機械附着的，這種汚點用紅油和肥皂液或者Benzene都可除去。</p>
<p>臘樹脂　乾燥後用小刀漸漸除去他的大部份，青拿Banzene塗上去，隔了一會，用力磨擦，倘還是不能除去，那末用氣化鎂和Beizene揑成圓形物，塗附於這汚點的上面，乾了後用毛刷刷去，那末汚點就可以全部除掉，並且如於色彩也没有妨礙。</p>
<p>鐵銹漬　夏天雪白的夏衣上，常常會發現一點點黄色的點子普通人誤認爲蒼蠅屎的就是，倘使是淡薄的痕跡，可以用醋酸和草酸的濃厚溶液洗去，倘使是深濃的痕跡，那末先拿錫的粉末塗在汚點上，再拿醋酸和草酸同上面的方法處理；倘還是不能除去，那末先用温水濕潤這汚點，再塗上檸檬酸和酒石酸的混合液，然後用水洗去他；不過上面的三種方法，不能够應用有色的衣服，有色的倘使有了鐵銹漬，那末可以用肥皂水和甘油拌和後塗在這汚點部去，放置二小時到三小時，他大部份就可以除份，洗過之後就潔凈了。</p>
<p>墨水汚點　墨色以外的墨水汚點，用肥皂洗後就可以除去，但這方法不能應用於有色物上，在有色特上的墨水汚點，要用酒精和同量的磠精水拿筆塗上，丨丨須塗幾次丨丨就可以大部消滅，倘使是白色的棉織物，那末用了上述的方法後。再用漂折粉漂他，倘使是絲織物或毛織物埘，那末用硵精水和肥皂液混合後洗他，或者加鋅末在酸性亞硫酸鈉液中抖過後，拿這液濕潤汚點部份，徵熱後就可除去。</p>
<p>黑色墨水的汚點　用肥皂液洗後，再用鐵銹漬處理方法處理他，痕漬就可降去，因爲黑色墨水中，是含有鐵份的。</p>
<p>黴汚點　乾燥後用毛刷刷凈，再用硵精水的薄液洗滌，大部份就可以除去了，但是倘使是因爲黴點變色的東西，那末他的痕跡，簡直無論如何難能完全消除掉的。</p>
<p>汗汚點　倘使日子不多，那末用水洗過後就可除去，否則用硵精水洗。</p>
<p>菓子汁汚點　用硼砂水和硵精水混合液洗，倘使不能除去，那末用漂白法。</p>
<p>酒和糖的汚點　倘使日子不多，用水先，否則用菓子汁的汚點除去方法處理，倘使經過時日太久，就不能除去。</p>
<p>烟草的烟脂汚點　用水瓜汁和冬瓜汁除去。</p>
<p>血汚點　拿乳濕潤這汚點，再用印水紙吸。</p>
<p>墨汚點　用濃厚的膠液塗在這汚點部份，乾後拿小刀細細創除，或者拿少量食鹽水洗後，再拿飯粒在上面摩擦，最後用水洗他，這方法結果最好，不過往往有傷布質。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這當然是很掃興的！其實，這種繁文縟節對於太后，眞可説是極普通的家常便飯，那一天没有，它們簡直到處把太后包圍着，不讓伊有清靜的機會，不過情形畢竟有些不同，往日在宫中整日整夜所搬演的許多儀式，雖説是因爲太后自已太不肯放鬆的緣故，形式上總是非常的莊嚴，但無論如何，大家到底不能使這種演得過於純熟的巴戲永久維持着緊張活躍的精神，而這一次在天津站上舉行接駕典禮時，却是人人都感覺到有一種比較興奮的情緒，像尋當人在每次逢到什麽節令日的情形一様。尤其不同的是，差不多每個人，都有幾分旅行的樂趣，在神情之間顯露着。</p>
<p>太后現在雖是一般的也端坐在伊那一間弄車上的小朝廷裏，但伊的視綫，却不再集中在車壁上各個小木架所托着的許多珠玉古玩上了；伊只是目不稍瞬地看着那一條幸運的小狗，和那兩頭初到的鸚鵡。伊的意思似乎是想知道狗見了鸚鵡，鸚鵡見了狗之後，會有什麽特殊的動作做出來？就是我，也滿心以爲這兩種畜生旣已安置在一起，必不能没有新的事故，在這座小朝廷裏發生了。豈知事實恰好和理想截然相反；那狗對於鸚鵡，根本並没有什麽興趣，彷彿不曾看見它們一様；這已可證明那狗雖然具有比較奇特一些的外貌，但它的智慧，却仍和尋常的狗，不相上下，丨丨也許是更笨一些，我眞不明白，太后爲什麽獨是歡喜它？（一三八）</p>

<h3>轟動北平之足球賽東華在平戰勝震寰詳記</h3>
<p>三對一震寰臨了奪回一球</p>
<p>（北平特訊）滬東華足球隊、今日（二十七日）在平首次與震寰足球隊交綏、四時半在消防足球塲舉起烽火、確係一塲惡戰、平市民慕名前往參觀者、不下五千餘人、只擠得消防塲大門、水洩不通、車水馬龍盛况、爲歷來所僅見、門票計分六角三角兩種、取價不爲不昂、而是日售出票數不下四千餘張、塲之四週、均已欄杆圍繞、南面搭有看臺、密密層層、佈滿人頭、後至者已無立足之地、四時甫過、雙方隊員相繼出塲、略試足頭、即行開火、王振聲任裁判、祗見他乎兒高揚、嘠的一聲、銀筒長鳴、雙方健兒、各自紥穏陣脚、刹那間人馬齊至、殺機伏下、原來雙方陣式如下、</p>
<p>東華隊</p>
<p>陸鍾恩　李寗　關洵安　陳洪光　馮運佑　趙靄生（下）　馮念漢（上）</p>
<p>萬象華　李義巨　戴麟經　陳家球　符質彬</p>

<p>王與民　金阿督　傳信秋　徐斐民（下）　林松發（上）　安原生　李鳳樓</p>
<p>武貴成　閻承寛　連宣勛　王精熹　張之楨（上）　唐國樑（下）</p>
<p>東華東取、震寰西攻、東華隊右邊曹秋亭因腿部在滬比賽時受傷、至今尚未痊愈、致未登塲、乃代以符質彬、實力减去不少、震寰隊陣綫無大更改、提開陣綫、幾次肉搏、不分高下、惟震寰隊係取攻勢、兩度進臨敵陣、惜未命中、東華隊確是老將、不遇强敵、不肯賣勁、震寰即然膽大進犯、這才提起精神、先鋒拉緊馬韁、中堅之路接應、一鼓作氣、衝將上前、馮運佑中路進迨、戴麟經李義臣左右恊攻、震寰隊經比</p>
<p>兩度危急乃亦改變方式、調回三軍、加緊防守、惟東華隊得寸進尺、步步加攻、這時早氣煞震寰後衛、屢欲反乎、而方不足、終因兵圍四週、左右被困、賴幾度掙扎之餘、未能化危爲夷、適金阿督因隊心切、誤獨乎部、於二門綫前之數武、馮運佑主罰、舉足叩去、球撞南角門楹、</p>
<p>未曾命中　雖然脫險、亦云幸矣、戰不五分鐘、馮運佑復得罰乎球之機會、球復擦門頂斜出、震寳隊固屬微倖、而東華先鋒叩門之凖確度、則令觀衆失望、東華見攻無所獲、亦見鬆懈、震寳見於自家時運亨通、博戰必然勝利、前鋒聯兵一處、由左方擊入、武貴成得閣承寳之助、乘勢打去、直奔東華門角、陸鐘恩阻之未果、被震寰前鋒包圍、一陣泥　、摩烟四起、於是</p>
<p>震寰叩關　亦歸失敗、武貴成發來角球、王精喜張之楨奔前叩關、均飽吃閉門美、但早惹惱了東華後衛李寗、一足站穏、一足運力、着凖球身、即是一脚、前烽符質彬再前綫見是機會、倒身後退、所以球落地處、即在符君身旁、説時遲那時快、小小球兒早隨符先鋒貼着地面滾向震空城、門守出救不及、坐守亦不得乎、致被打中一球、</p>
<p>東華首捷　再開球後、震　雖力行反攻、終因士氣不振、未能即刻奪回城池、前半時一比零、東華倍吃味、濘檬潤喉後、易防對壘、精力回復、益見精采、戰未片刻、李義臣單槍匹馬、衝入重團、猛叩山門、球急且低、擦地射入、迨震衰門將站穏時、方知</p>
<p>再度陷城　此時震寰已爲中矢猛虎、暴怒之餘、復感創痛、攻守均不順利、十五分鐘後、東華隊大兵復來犯境、戴麟經統率之軍、往返奔施、藉烟幕突進、震寰門前、一時兵慌馬亂、賴救獲得法、均未命中、最後激惱、李義臣捲土重來、萬象華乘此打刦、從中側應、致又被、</p>
<p>命中紅白　震寰此時徒喚奈何、攻不得利、退陳又不能實現、遂改變方策、聲東擊西、果見效騐、李鳳樓刦得來球、一足送出、關永寛繼之覆旋而上、直搗黄龍、東華隊因大兵在外調回不易、致演空城、亦是勝利之餘、輕敵之心太重、後防只餘門守及李寗二人、一乎難擋衆敵、乃被取回一關、此時四圍觀衆、呼韾雷動、加油之聲、不絶於耳、但震寰隊因抗敵時久、業已力盡聲嘶、無能爲力矣、後半時二比一、震寰仍失利、總結果三比一、東華告捷、</p>

<h3>新式擴聲器</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>普通駛動式（Durivingsystem）的電動擴聲器使用於强大放音機上，每有缺點；第一；當音圈駛動於磁塲的空隙間，其强度内端常較大於外端，難以平衡，易使音調失眞；第二；配合變壓器至音圈間的軟綫接頭上常易發生中斷等障碍。</p>
<p>無綫電研究家近又發現改良的新式擴聲器，原理及使用法，曾載刋於美國無綫電業餘家（Radioamateur）雜誌上，今略譯介紹於此，如圖甲及乙所示，Ａ爲特種式的銜鐵（Armature）以變壓器的砂鋼片製成Ｌ１，Ｌ２，Ｌ３，Ｌ４，四綫圈則分繞於此銜鐵上，此四綫圈如圖連接，Ｌ１與Ｌ４的兩端，接至推挽式的放大器兩眞空管屏極上，作爲輸出回路、（猶如變壓器的正圈·）ＬＭ爲可動式的音圈，此新式擴聲器與普通電動擴聲器的構造及效用略有不同，構造較爲簡單，並其磁塲由强力管屏流流過，使自動激勵鐵心，與音波電流强弱成正比。</p>
<h3>甲　乙　丙</h3>
<p>音圈ＬＭ乃是一只閉合回路誘導圈（Closedcircuitlnductance)置在鐵心中央，見圖甲，乙及丙所示，圖中雙箭頭形指示屏流的直流流動方向，此乃以激勵磁塲的，單箭頭形指示瞬息的交流電變動方向，磁塲由直流電接於銜鐵間使强度成固定情形，以實綫表之，磁塲由屏流的成音交流輸入，以致變動的狀態，則以虚綫表之，在銜鐵中部磁綫的變化，乃使感應音圈（亦名動圈）成一交流回路；回此固定磁塲的磁力綫與ＬＭ音圈的感應電流起一相反作用，使音圈駛動，此駛動方向可或前或後，如一蒸汽機上的活塞；或可成圓運動，如一電動機上的銜鐵；惟此須依四固定線圈接法如何而定之。</p>
<p>假若欲使上述兩動作中的一種，例如活塞動作，則其連接簡法如丙圖。</p>
<h3>低週率變壓器斷綫之原因</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>低週率變壓器在收言機及播音機内所佔地位的重要，是任何人都知道的，可是牠有一件很惹人厭惡的事情，便是時常容易斷綫。</p>
<p>起初，一般人都以爲變壓器斷綫的原因，是由於所用導綫太細，電流過載四燒斷的。其實，事實上却並不這様的簡單。</p>
<p>有人以美金十二元之代價，購用大號（綫圈用較粗導綫繞成）低週率變壓器一只，以爲一定可以高枕無憂了。誰知不到一星期，便告斷綫！後來換用價值僅華幣二元之小型變壓器，却繼續用了十個多月，依舊完好如新。</p>
<p>作者數年來，曾以粗細不同的導綫，自繞低週率變壓器多只，經過數十次的試騐，結果發現：</p>
<p>低週率因變壓因變壓器由於電流過載而燒斷者，僅佔少數：其由於因沾受潮灦而蝕斷者，反佔多數。</p>
<p>這不是信口胡説，是有事實可以證明的；</p>
<p>一·通常低週率變壓器初級綫圈，大槪是用四十號綫繞成的。此種導綫，雖規定容許通過電流之數值僅爲。。。６安培，但是事實上須要通過三安培以上的電流，纔能燒斷。</p>
<p>二·以同號導繞成的變壓器兩只，一只放在檢波管（卽第一級低週率放大，通常屏流約爲一千分安培左右。）内使用，一只則作末級强力管（通常屏流約在三十千分安培以上）輸出變壓器用。就理論而講，大槪　　先斷綫的，終是屬於第二只了，但是事實上却往往適得其反！這些，不都是很有些奇怪麽？</p>
<p>其實，原因是很简單的。上面已經説過，變壓器大槪多是由於因沾受潮濕而斷綫的。我們知道，熱是與電流的平方成正比的，（Ｈｅａｔ＝ｌ２Ｒｔ）換句話説：導綫内通過之電流愈大，則産生之熱度亦愈高，熱度高則變壓器便時常會保持乾燥，變壓器旣不易沾受潮濕，當然也不易蝕斷了。</p>
<p>讀者如果不信，不妨將損壞的變壓器拆下，細察斷綫的地方，往往很容易發現綠色的霉點，却很少會見到燒焦的痕跡。這不是很明顯的鐵證麽？</p>
<p>至於導綫所以會蝕斷的原因，也得附帶一説，大槪總不外乎：</p>
<p>一·繞製不愼有許多粗製濫造的變壓哭，牠的綫圈是用手工繞成的。如果繞綫圈的工人，手上沾有酸類或汗水等物質。那麽，蝕斷事實的發生，自在意料之中。</p>
<p>二·銲接不妥變壓器綫圈的頭尾兩處，銲接時應絶對避免使用含有酸性的接合劑，（Elux）否則日久便難免因發生腐蝕作用（Corrosicn）而斷綫。</p>
<p>三·封固不密任你繞製怎様謠愼，銲接怎様妥善的變壓器，如果封固不密，日久侵受外界潮濕，也會斷綫的。變壓器在霍雨期内特别容易損壞，便是這個原因。有些封因考究的變壓器，據説，卽使浸在水中一個多月，内部還能絲毫不受影響。</p>
<p>四·位置不當收音機如果放在潮濕或是靠近墻壁等地方，那麽，斷綫的機會，當然也會特别的多。</p>
<p>此外，變壓器因感受劇烈的震動，内部發生短路，或在使用時屏流突然中斷······等等··在在都足以使牠有斷綫的可能，這裏，因爲篇幅的關係，不再詳述。</p>

<p>舍來克（Sliellec）一名洋乾漆，普通油溙店均有出售，價格甚廉。此物在無綫電中頗多利用之處，因其可用爲絶緣力甚强之油漆，又能作爲（萬用之黏合劑）也。今略述其幾種用法如下：</p>
<p>在使用舍來克之前，先應使之溶解於酒精之中。法取任意多少之酒精，置入玻璃瓶中，再將此玻璃瓶放入熱水中温之，然後加入舍來克少許，遂溶遂加，至不再溶解爲度，即得舍來克之酒精溶液，可供下面之用。</p>
<p>甲·膠木板代用品之製法取乾燥之三夾板，塗以舍來克之酒精溶液二三次，即得易於鑽洞而不易碎裂之膠木板代用品矣。</p>
<p>乙·絶緣接綫之自製法取十八號雙紗包綫若干尺，塗以舍來克之酒精溶液二三次，俟乾，即得價廉物美，應用便利之絶緣接綫，極合銲接收音機之用。</p>
<p>丙·用爲綫之固定物波長表及短波收音機中之綫圈之表狀，須不使稍有走様，以免變更其誘導率。可塗以舍來克之酒精溶液二三次，則其形狀不致走動矣。</p>
<p>丁·修補擴音器紙盆之碎裂處亦可塗以此物，則發聲可清晰如常。</p>
<p>戊·萬用黏合劑舍來克爲一種萬用的黏合劑，不論何種固體物質幾乎均可用以黏合（金屬亦在内）且接合處又不畏潮濕。例如膠木板碎裂後，可在其裂縫處塗以舍來克之酒精溶液，將碎塊拚合靜置，俟乾即黏合不脫矣。</p>
<h3>馬可尼的新發明丨（無綫電燈塔）</h3>
<p>— 履中</p>
<p>無綫電發明家馬可尼氏在上月某日帶着勝利的微笑，站在他專作試騐的（伊勒脫拉）（Electra）遊艇駕駛室内，試騐他最近發明成功的無綫電燈塔（Theradioligboncuse）指引遊艇，該艇駕駛室的窗上全用簾布密遮，使不能透視外方，馬氏與船長在中盲目地駕駛，竟能安全的入意大得Sesinilevante港口。</p>
<p>馬氏發展無綫電交能，已拯救千萬人的生命在危難之中，然這無綫電燈塔能拯救千萬隻汽船，當在濃霧大雨時駛入港口，俾免衝撞的大禍，所以馬氏稱它爲偉大的發明。</p>
<p>這試騐在Sesinilevante港口進口處的海面三百尺高岬上設一超短波發射站；復有兩無綫電燈塔，（請參看附圖）置小　短波發射機，此燈塔設於海港進口處兩浮站上，中距約三百尺左右。</p>
<p>在遊艇上有接收機一具，裝着兩指示器；一是可見的，有一只如電表的儀器，表上指針依船駛方向或左或右而移動，一是可聽的，從擴聲器中告示該船駛的方向錯悮了。</p>
<p>主發射機上發出的訊號，由無綫電燈塔中繼後，遂爲遊艇收得。時船繼續駛在兩無綫電燈塔中的目的地方向前進則指示表上指針正指中央，如見指針偏斜一邊，則船駛方向太偏左或太偏右了，這（依勒脫拉）遊艇安全駛入港口時，馬氏與船長盲目地駕駛着，絶未曾觀察海岸綫或引港綫，馬氏説：（世界上每個港口，在此數年中必將應用此無綫電定向器）。</p>
<p>可聽的指示器能從擴聲器中發出兩種訊號，一是高音調的，而另一是低音調的，當船駛在目的地方向中，訊號常保持平音，但若船偏駛於一邊，擴聲器中卽發出一種高音調或一種低音調的聲浪，警告駕駛員，使其注意觀察在可見的指示器上，駛向如何錯悞。</p>
<h3>收音機唱機接續器之改造</h3>
<p>— 林桂苓</p>
<p>當在本刋第七十一期見到了明襄君的佳作（收音機唱機接續器）一文後，作者頗思仿製一具，無奈苦於另件的缺乏，不得已，就將牠改造了一下，另件完全取之於舊有的收音機上，據試騐的结果，成績確是不差，接在一隻自製的ＴＲＦ交流五管機上，發音極響，與裝上天地綫收音本埠一百瓦特以上電台播相仿，比單接在檢波管栅路中，要優越音得多多了。</p>
<p>同病的明友丨苦於受另件束缚的同志，丨有暇不妨一試。</p>
<p>這裏不過一種參考，希望同志用你們的聰慧去多多的改良，也許有更好的在績發現呢？</p>

<p>九月份金鷄標紗在四月二日上塲價爲一百七十七元九角、此時適值春消失望、市價仍步趨下游、跌至一百七十三元外、繼以華粗紗價格較日紗爲廉、北帮採辦需要發動、天津帮買去不少、人心激起、市價由此轉機、迨至七八月中、金融界見花價高而紗價低、各廠虧本殊巨、停工减工者頗多、而美棉實行彭海德計畫、生産數量减少、於是買者意態愈濃、看漲心思更堅、因之市面繼長增高、最高價曾見一百八十八九元光景、市價　一漲、引起日商抛賣、同時有一部份廠家套賣而到期紗有一千六百五十包、此貨歡迎者較少、壓迫尤得、延至本月内最低價又見一百七十一元五角、空頭獲利抵補、由回漲至四元八角、最後一盤爲一百七十三元五角、較八月份跌七元五角、結果殘餘四千七百五十包、交割價爲一百七十四元、貨物二十支人鐘一千六百五十包、其餘皆爲自行交割、茲將收交兩方經紀人號碼及數量如下、</p>

<h3>著書的法門</h3>
<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>著書的藝術）（Theartofbookmaking）中説；他最初不明白那些生來没有天才的作家而生産特别豐富的原因。一天他到了英國大英圖書館中看到兩個製造書的人；一個人是專門搜集那些蠹魚口中殘存的英國古文的材料著作成書，還有一個人是找了許書，這一本書中抄幾行，那一本書中，抄幾行，著作成書，他才明白著書藝術，原來如此。</p>
<p>在中國，（各國也許都如此）類乎前一種著書的人，是那些研究龜甲·金石·以及自春秋戰國一直到清代的綫裝書）的人，這一批學者是靠賴已死人的著作，從那中間找些材料，加以推考，説明，討論，過活的。古人的東西，自然没有版權，就是你代他發行，把欵子撈入自已腰包，古人也不會來請你吃官司，向你討版稅的，也决不會像歐文所想像的那様，古代著作家之鬼一個個從牆上跳下來把一個摩登的教授衣服剥光，使他現出原形，把一個文學家的秘密戳穿，使他狼狽不堪！語堂大師畢竟是個老滑頭　，（偷古人版稅，養我妻孥，有何不可，）（大意是如此），眞一語道破了其中奥妙。</p>
<p>類乎後一種著書的人，自然是像我們這様靠報紙雜誌吃飯的人。中國目前的刋物除開純文學刋物外，政治經濟的刋物上的材料，大部分是靠賴報紙，所以我們吃飯的工具，只要幾份報紙，一把剪刀，一瓶漿糊，一本貼報紙的簿子，就够，最多不過的再加些整理的工作，與少用些腦力，把生的材料，拿來説明一下，就是一篇大文章，可以拿去賣錢用。這様的工作，持之有恒，過了幾年，也許就會成爲一部幾十萬言的洋洋大著作，雖則你的材料是從報紙上用剪刀翦來，但誰也不敢來向你興師問罪，更没有誰敢來請你吃官司。</p>
<p>此外還有一種著書人，歐文没有講到，也許歐文的時代，這件事還不大盛行。可是在中國，這種著書的法門，有特别便利之處，那就是你如果懂得外國文字，把外國作家的作品，拿來整個的翻譯或抄譯其中幾部，作爲自已著的書。中國沒有加入國際版權會，抄譯外國已死的作家的著作，固然不成問題，卽是現在還生存的作家，你把他的著作抄譯過來，他也不會板起面孔來向你興師問罪，或打官司。</p>
<p>但有志著書的人，切不要犯的一件事，就是偷抄國内現在尚生存的作家的材料。因爲現在尚生存的作家，他的著作，雖則不大高明，雖則也是從别人那地方偷抄來的，但如果你一偷抄了他的著作，給他發現，他就要板起面孔，拿出學者的權威與你爲難，結果你非但白費心血，成不了名，拿不到稿費，以後還要弄得走頭無路，不能再斯斯文文摻入學者之流去。</p>
<p>著作的法門，就是如此，這是是黑幕，也不是秘密，這是歷來如此的事實。</p>
<p>至於講到著作的好和壞，並不是在你的抄襲，與不抄襲，而是在你能否把抄襲來的材料，加以精煉製造過没有，你如是能像麥克貝士（Macbeth）一様，把東找來一塊（田鷄的趾），西找來一塊蜥蝪的尾，和以猢狲的血，放在魔術師的鎔鍋丨一個人的腦丨中，製成有機的食物或藥劑，丨能這様抄襲，一定會受人家歡迎的。</p>
<h3>妻的入院</h3>
<p>— 暉嬴</p>
<p>這一天，妻剛剛下課，依她的意思，還要改幾本練習簿，可是肚子裏的小動物在開始活動了，足足痛了好一陣子工夫，甚至把她痛哭了。</p>
<p>據醫生檢查的結果，説産期就是這幾天，我就急了，跟妻説到醫院去看看，該住院就住院。</p>
<p>妻帶着滿身苦痛坐上黄包車，（爲什麽我們就没有汽車坐呢？）走了，給我留下無限的恐怖；兩個過去的事實，很快的在我的頭腦中飛馳過去‘</p>
<p>ＸＸ的愛人，不是爲了生孩子才死的麽？最近去世的廬隠，不也是死於生産麽？呵，這事情，···········</p>
<p>我不敢再想了，就算這様，我還是像親眼看見妻在醫院中的疼痛呻吟的情形。</p>
<p>（爲什麽不跟她去呢！）　　我後悔了，但過一會就明白過來這種悔恨是多餘的，妻所以自已去醫院，不要求我同去，原是她顧慮到金錢上啊。</p>
<p>本來，像我們這様生活都難以維持的人，就没有理由再生孩子，天，爲什麽我們就不能有個孩子呢，這世界，生孩子是成爲某一種人的專利品麽？我不承認。這事情丨</p>
<p>我正在接着想，自已是個飯桶漢子，不會抓錢（其實也是這社會不給機會給我抓錢，）這時候，妻回來了。還是帶回來疼痛的肚子。</p>
<p>（怎麽，没有看麽？）</p>
<p>看她這様，我急急問。</p>
<p>（過時間了。）</p>
<p>（我不是跟你説，過時間就要求住院麽？）</p>
<p>（要兩塊特别掛號費。）</p>
<p>（怎黀，住院也要掛號，要特别掛號？）</p>
<p>我眞懷疑這所謂半慈善性質的醫院，一面生着不可解的憤氣。如果，我們要是有錢的話，兩塊錢算得什麽，説句老實話，要是有錢，也不預備住這家慈善爲懷的醫院呢。如今，慈善兩字，實在有深加清算一下的必要。</p>
<p>妻的肚子愈發痛得厲害了，不能説話，只是彎着腰捧着肚子哭呌。我扶着她，問道；</p>
<p>（那麽。到ＸＸ醫院去好不好？那裏不是住院不要特别掛號麽？）</p>
<p>妻答不出話，但她點頭了，這回，我不能不陪着去了，多化一個人的車錢我也要去，因爲我不放心她！我眞想餓幾天肚子不吃飯，空出點錢給她僱一輛汽車坐坐，可是我這意見讓妻否决了。</p>
<p>到了ＸＸ醫院，我非常心虚，生怕再要特别掛號費。没錢的人，一舉一動都在打算着金錢，對於金錢簡直變成了可憐的奴隸。天保佑，這家醫院還没有收特别掛號費，我的内心裏着實寛鬆不少。</p>
<p>緊跟着，新的恐怖又來了；</p>
<p>（她將是平安無事的過了這個難關，還是會變成了不幸的犧牲者？</p>
<p>我們走進XXX號房中，妻在呌着，喊痛；我的心在跳着，怕，怕，怕什麽呢？······</p>
<h3>「人丹，阿要買仁丹？」</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>朋友之間</h3>
<p>— 陳碧冰</p>
<p>十年來海飄流，耳聞或目見，丨丨尤其是自身經歷所及，總覺得處世這類事件，初想來，似乎容易，實際上，却非常玄妙。</p>
<p>人類，原就是分有許多種的，有善的，還有更善的，有惡的，還有更惡的，但是大多數的人類，却是不善也不惡。</p>
<p>也許是因爲趣味的相投，也許是因爲感情的接近，若干人，本來環境不同，但却居然可以成爲知交契友。</p>
<p>而若干人本來在一處共事，環境也不不相上下，然而偏偏意見相左，成爲寃家仇敵。</p>
<p>如其説是精神的融洽，無寗説是利害的相投，今日親家，明日仇敵，明日仇敵，後日親家，這類的事，眞是數見不鮮本來，這也無足怪，在這拜金主義的時代，一切人爲關係，都是物的，而非靈的。因此有些人便抱定一個固定主張，這主張就是；（什麽人都是不好的，只有金錢是好的。）他對於什麽人，都没有同情兩字，你向他們訴苦嗎。他們會回答你説，（他們從前你還痛苦得多。）他們總以爲痛苦是每個人都應有的，丨丨即他們能對你帮助，但他們還是爲他方面打算，他們對於你待遇苛刻。那簡直無可形容，這種扶助的動機，决不是他們對你帮忙，那是他們利用你處境痛苦這麽一個弱點，可以用少數的金錢，購買你多量的勞力。</p>
<p>不過從另一方面，交朋友，確有時間性和空間性的，許多人，只可以共患難，不能共安樂，許多人，又只可以共安樂，而不能共患難。勢利，在這社會裏家人父子兄弟也難免，何况朋友这間？所以若干人，他來請求你時是一副面孔，等候你去哀求他時又是一副面孔，本我經騐所得，當你有辦法時，一些不用朋友擔負的事，朋友都會自薦應承擔任下來，但等候失意困苦時，則一些尚不須費什麽力量的事，朋友也會拒絶。這種行爲，如其説他勢利，固然可以，但如其説他勢利，固然可以，但如其説他行爲不德，他本人决不承認。</p>
<p>再者朋友之間，誤會這類的事，也是難免的，這在知覺敏捷，性情粗燥，或者刺激極多的人更易發生。每每以極微小的細故，發生極大的衝突，丨丨甚至好意當作惡意，愛之愈深，而恨之亦愈切，结果，自不外絶交这一途。痥來非常令人痛心。</p>
<p>更有些人，犯了誇大狂，喜歡説誑，丨丨甚至無中生有。知已朋友，金錢來往的事有時原爲不可避免，但某種朋友即以此到處傳説，向其他朋友相誇耀，自認爲是他的最大度的慷慨，結果，好意只有當作惡意，金錢或一頓飯的友誼究竟是有價格的，而他人名譽，却無價格估計了，因此，請朋友們吃飯或金錢來往的事，也不一定是交友的必需手段。</p>
<p>君子之交淡於水，若干人，在没有什麽變故發生之前，和他來往，他倒是平淡的很，態度中庸的很，有話時説話，没有話説，也不會故意逢迎人的，但是，等候任何朋友遭了意外的災難打擊，有所懇求於他時，他倒是態度極其誠摰，力之所及，總會對你帮忙的，他非但因你破産而輕視你，相反的，他倒對你更大的同情，較之以前平常的交際來往還要超過一倍的契合，這種人，的確是可以相交，不過百人中難覓一人丨丨普通的人，大约都是勢利的居絶大多數。</p>
<p>還有些朋友，他們在失意時，本是庸庸碌碌的很，精神沮喪，行動頽唐的很，但等候他得意了，發展了，却有不可一世之概，説話也響亮了，精神也奮發了，行路時也居然昂然挺起胸子了，你去會他時，他分明没有什麽事，也會裝出很忙的様子，令你在會客室中等候一二個鐘頭，甚至故意當你的面來大駡僕役，以表示出他的尊嚴，威風凛凛。</p>
<p>又有些人，他對於什麽人都不得罪，都是笑顔常開，但你若因處境困苦，向他告貨，那末他便毅然决然担絶了，明明力量所能辦到，而且絲毫無損他的預算的徵小數目，也不問所持理由若何，都是拒绝的，丨丨分明是平等的人，但你一向他開口借錢，他便認爲你是下流，較他渺小了。</p>
<p>但又有些人，囊中舞錢，偏遇到友人告貸，其痛苦實較之借貸的當事人還有過之，也有約會下午或明天來，自已便質當衣物以應付朋友的。</p>
<p>更有些人，在惠而不費的範圍内，給你一點不關金錢的帮助，是可以的，但若借錢，便一個銅子也不可能。</p>
<p>雖則上述種種多類，但，人類中大多數，總是不好也不壤，不費力量，給你一點子帮助，是可以的，遇奢的希望，那是不可能。</p>
<p>像筆者，則生性下流，有錢時接濟他人，無錢時受人接濟。對於善人，明知其善除心中感激外也無任何實際酬報，對於惡人，明知其惡，除心中咒駡外也無任何仇敵行爲。然而像現代社會，好人處處吃虧，惡人處處便宜，這所以無形之間，是奬勵人類作惡，故青年處世，更覺困難。</p>
<h3>鄉長先生（十）（四）</h3>
<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>冬生瘸乎，足足在亭子裏坐上一個鐘頭。鄉長馮文先生底呌聲，從街頭送了過來。把自已從頗閒適，且也頗崇高的境地裏拽出，知道又有什麽差事要他去幹了，那時候，冬生瘸乎，又揮着薑節似的乎，自駡自聽地：</p>
<p>（他媽的，鄉警眞不是人當的！一隻癩狗！）</p>
<p>冬生瘸手又拿出他拐也似的走路的風格，走去。</p>
<p>鄉長馮文先生，在大生先生裕生號舖子裏。</p>
<p>這裕生號舖子，本來是馮文先生父親底遺産。現在連屋子器物貨色一起都盤給了大生先生。</p>
<p>馮文先生因爲没本錢，配不齊貨；且也配不起貨。三個銅子黄糖，二個銅子針，買主大都是那麽零碎的。可是你幾次給買主碰了壁，買主就少上你門了，馮文先生時代的裕生號，就那麽的熄下去了。</p>
<p>大生先生可有了打算。</p>
<p>幾年來，鄉裏年年閙水災。（七月半大水這已成了句古話了。可是水災一發生，各處橋梁堤壩，總要衝去一大半。前年七月半大水，可破了例；幾十年來不曾衝倒過，牛頭村村頭一座常安橋，竟也衝去了一座（破水）。</p>
<p>常安橋是十幾丈高大建築。全由一方塊一方塊石板砌成。一連五個大環洞。環洞和環洞相連處，砌上一座座（破水）。三角錐那麽地，尖口向外，破分着水流。</p>
<p>那一天，大水過了三天，大生先生領着族長，站在橋上着。橋二旁圍着石欄杆，每個石柱上，雕上一隻獅子白象之類，大生先生抱着石柱，歎息地説：</p>
<p>（要是今年不把這座破水修起，也許明年這洞橋也難保了。）</p>
<p>（是的。）族長照例是以大生先生意見爲意見的。</p>
<p>（這洞橋不保，我爺爺那番心血白丢了，且還慢説；就是牛頭村風水也給破掉了。</p>
<p>（應該修，應該修，風水是要緊的。）族長更肯定地回答。</p>

<h3>軍火商操縱國會選舉</h3>
<p>— 敏</p>
<p>不多幾天，據報載美國參院軍火調查委員會調查出美國軍火商，有操縱國會選舉的秘密，這可謂是近時民主政治上一大丢臉的事。其實，所謂民主政治，其秘密也早被一般人所窺破了。所謂議員老爺，左右不過是幾個資本家的工具，這一點，是世人早已很清楚的知道的。而現在，更由美國的軍火商操縱國會選舉的事來證明，所謂民主政治，就更給人很清楚的看出，究竟是個什麽東西了。</p>
<p>然而這裏還有一點更重要的，軍火商操縱國會選舉，這表現目前的政治，是什麽一種政治呢？很顯然的，這是表示，目前的政治，不獨美國的，而是世界上任保一國的，都走上了最緊張的備戰階段。所以，軍火商就不期面與這個政治相呼應，特别活躍起來。軍火商的活躍，正是表示，目前是急急需要軍火的時代；軍火在這時代，是世界上任何一國最需要的急用品。這様，我們就可看出，目前的世界，是怎様一天一天被推送到極濃厚的戰雲中云。</p>
<h3>雨衣</h3>
<p>— 洪奔</p>
<p>猛然的從雨打窗欞的震撼裏醒了過來，意識到今天還是註册的第三天，事情是那麽地煩忙，還得趕一天早。丨這損失我籌劃着將來設法補償。</p>
<p>很怱忙的把面揩了，看看手錶已是七點半了，再不趕快，那麽擁擠的辦公室的門前，是無法擠進去了。於是三步併成兩步，走下了三轉十八彎的樓房，呆立在門口。雨傾盆般的下着，我只是想這雨若早下一個半月，豈僅是甘霖而已，直是一滴一顆稻，一條命呢。等，一等再等，雨越發下得大了，再看看錶，已是八點一刻了，只得冒着雨跑上辦公室去，辦公室離宿舍是這麽遠，约計總跑了上五分鐘，氣喘吁吁的才跑到，滿身已像一隻落水雞。好在中餐時雨下得細了，於是回到宿舍。更換好衣，想起了兩件避雨的東西，丨其一是傘（陽傘雨傘皆可）又一是雨衣。這兩種東西，我本有的，傘被朋友借去了，就想起了久盛在皮箱裏的雨衣。</p>
<p>説到這件雨衣，一向是（備而不用）的，這回却必要取出來了。恰巧飯後雨又傾盆般的下將起來，這時我是所恃而無恐了，辦公時間到了，我就披起雨衣往樓下跑，但爲着頭上究少了一隻雨帽，走出門也還不能不跑得快，到了辦公室把雨衣一卸，竟發現衣服也和冒雨跑時一様的濕淋淋。</p>
<p>於是我躊躇了。因爲是註册的末一天的下午了，而又下着大雨，下午註册的人非常稀少，我就趁想這閒暇，專心尋思這雨衣爲什麽不能避雨的道理，貨色雖不入時，但質料是好的，而且是嶄新新的，雖然放在皮箱裏快兩年了從未拿出來正式用過。想來想去，想了半天，答案還是不大可靠丨雨衣斷斷是避雨的，而且是能避雨的。但事實太使人着慌，我的嶄新的雨衣而竟不能避雨。</p>
<p>下了辦公室，回到宿舍來又想了不少時候，才把這道理悟透。</p>
<p>大槪（其實應下肯定語）都市裏的人們在雨天裏披雨衣，也視它是一種裝飾品，至少是披起好玩的，一個時髦的人，如果在雨天之下，一步一步的慢踱，把上等的衣服當着大衆的眼睛淋濕，未免要被人駡爲（猪攞）。如果鼠竄鼠竄的在街頭亂跑，這，衣服或可避免被雨淋濕，但又不免要被人嗤爲（傻子），（鄉下佬），這二者都不是辦法。</p>
<p>但是都市裏的人們，多數都有這麽一種古怪的脾氣，就是雨天不愛打傘，試看在街頭忙來忙去的西裝朋友，有誰帶着一把傘？傘雖是避雨的好東西，但都會裏的人們是視爲疣物的。爲要避免上述兩種的難堪，於是便披起雨衣來，把俗氣的傘丢棄不用了，惹得衣服被雨淋得濕濕地，也不在乎。</p>
<p>其實雨衣這種東西，名雖不差，雨是避不開的。本是闊人紳士們的御用品，比如在雨天裏坐着汽車或包車出門，從室内踱進汽車前，或從汽車上踱進室來，坐怕一兩點屋　水滴上衣服或頸子，弄到不大舒服所以要披雨衣來遮避，這様的人，自然需要服用這様的雨衣。　　　　此外，雨衣是别無所用，不過都會裏的人們，愛學（經杜曼）的様兒，方大家披帶起來，這様，就成了一種雨天的裝飾品。</p>
<h3>變</h3>
<p>— 金人</p>
<p>偶然從一隻遊過三關六碼頭的手提箱中搜出一張褐色了的像片，那是我小學畢業時照的像，背後曾註着民國九年夏日攝於ＸＸ等字様，一時高興，拿來放在寫字台上的鏡架中，和自已最近照的像片一比較，簡直没有絲毫相像的地方了。</p>
<p>從民國九年到現在，這悠長的距離，我是什麽都變了，人家對我説；自然本人也很清楚的瞭解，我從天眞的孩童時代進而至被社會所形成的中年人了。這逐漸的改變，兩張像片的不相像不過是表面罷了。然而我倒底變到什麽地步呢？最明顯的是我被家庭驅逐出來的，這種家庭衝突，不必以事實來作根據，我就錯得一塌糊塗而在故鄉站不住脚，於是我開始變了。</p>
<p>這我的手提箱可以作强有力證據，牠清白的四周被許多車站埠頭的名字呑没了；至於這手提箱的主人是否同様的變得不清不白，也有人强出頭來證明説；（家都不要了，眞看不出，這孩子會變到這様！）自然我是變到這様了，兩張像片，就没有一點相同的地方！</p>
<p>這一次，有一個偶然的機會，我們許多小時候的伴侣都相聚了。除了我變到這個様子之外，覺得仠麽人都變了。如其那時候的一張照的像片没有遺失的話，我想誰見了都要喊；（我變了！）可是我們三天的相聚，依舊像小時候一様的有説有笑，打混，佔小便宜，又好像誰都没有改變似的；而且我們中一個最長的姐姐説；（金弟還是老脾氣。）</p>
<p>可見我並没有變到（這様）的地步，於是我把兩張像片細細地把玩，想解决這個變不變的問題。説我變得（這様）的那個人，自然他透見了我已是（這様）了，不然，我和他一點没有利害衝突，他爲什麽要這般説呢，説我還是老脾氣的姐姐，我們是從小相處的，這様闊别了許多年，她的話自然不見得我們有三天的相聚而打趣我；然則，這問題如何解决呢？</p>
<p>變不變在於我個人，我不能爲了人家説我變不變而我變不變，這兩張像片雖然没有相像的地方，但是照的時候不就是我這（一）個人嗎？那變不變與人家有什麽關係呢？（節錄日記）</p>
<h3>秋夜流浪在上海街頭</h3>
<p>— 浪人</p>
<p>秋夜，流浪在上海街頭。</p>
<p>爲了事，竟誤了一次車子；找朋友，又碰了壁。於是，在冷意的秋風之下，竟使我嘗一嘗這大都市的黑魔的夜裏的滋味。</p>
<p>爲了荷包的冷縮，在這大都市裏享</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>樂是與我没緣的。去什麽地方好呢？對於一個慣住鄉間的人，而又碰着經濟的恐慌的，眞是難於主决呵！</p>
<p>便買了一本書，去茶館裏坐了整整二個鐘頭。孤寂地把靈魂浸沉在書裏。猛地一驚覺，壁上的時辰鐘已指着十一點。（找地方睡吧。）一决定，便踱上上海街頭了。</p>
<p>看街車是漸漸地稀疏了，富人們的車子却似乎不曾减少。一陣秋夜的寒風吹襲在我的身邊，頓然感到很大的冷意。夜生活的女人們羣攢在街邊，打着笑容拉客。一陣都市的戰慄在我的心上浮起。</p>
<p>（跳舞塲的夜是怎麽様呢？）</p>
<p>突然一個奇怪的感覺在我的心上浮起來。於是踱到跑馬廳畔，大光明戲院的大口剛散完了它的顧客，汽車便排起陣子馳驅了。大滬跳舞塲的小口觸着我的視綫，那莊嚴的階層嚇住了我。轉過身來。跑到大都會去。一入門，看見黯淡的燈光下團團的鬼魂在滾轉。又忽然抽轉身來；再度被吐在上海街頭上了。</p>
<p>（怎麽辦呢？）</p>
<p>（還是找地方睡吧）</p>
<p>便在南京路上踯躅了。看車子，是越形稀疏了；人也少了許多。一步步把脚步拖着走，覺到脚力的笨重。一臨到黄浦灘口，一陣灰白的月光突然帶來了寒冷的秋風，打了一個寒噤，便把昏暈的腦筋驚醒了。</p>
<p>（怎麽跑到這兒來呢？）</p>
<p>（喊黄包車吧，脚是有點不受指揮了！）</p>
<p>於是坐着車子，從夜的上海的心裏穿過。冷寂的街道眞令人疑心這並不是都市的上海。而不時的冷風更使我顫慄。</p>
<p>蘇州河用着黯淡的沉睡躺在上海的心裏。一個乞焉拉着我的車子，從我的渴想沉睡的手裏領受二個銅板。</p>
<p>（你，都市的賤民，你怎麽不生爲富家子吧？）</p>
<p>一在肚裏把自已的蠢話加以恥笑的時候，車便停在儉德公寓前了。</p>
<p>按了鈴，打發自已在一間房子裏。</p>
<p>上海，是富人們的上海呀丨不要説小　三，便是一個小資産階級，上海的夜是没有福分享受的。</p>
<p>一夜流浪的滋味呵，深深地印在我的心裏。</p>

<h3>Huang Zhao, Yin Ruigeng, Li Ze-yi and Others Discuss Handling the Gong-Yue Incident</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Held Two Secret Meetings</p>
<p>A Document Was Presented to the Hebei Provincial Government</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Immediately Plans to Go to Beiping to Meet Huang</p>
<p>The Details of the Negotiations Will Not Be Released for Now</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Gong-Yue incident in Yutian, after the representatives of both China and Japan exchanged views in Tianjin, the Japanese representatives Tanaka, Shibayama, etc., held two secret meetings on the 26th, and presented a document to the Hebei Provincial Government on the afternoon of the 26th, directly handling the negotiations with the provincial authorities. Huang Fu, upon receiving the report, summoned Yu Xuezhong, Li Ze-yi and Yin Rugeng, who had gone to Tianjin to handle the negotiations, to return to Beiping to inquire about everything. Li and Yin responded to the call and returned to Beiping together this morning. Yin, Tao Shangming, Li Ze-yi, and Yin Rugeng gathered at the political council one after another. First, Yin Rugeng reported on the progress, then they discussed everything. Yu Xuezhong scheduled to come to Beiping in a day or two to meet Huang, report on the negotiation situation, and discuss how to respond. Yin Rugeng stated that the details of the negotiation process for the Yutian incident were not convenient to release. The bandits in Zunhua have been defeated, but the direction of their escape is still unclear. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Huang Fu sent a telegram summoning the heads of various departments of the Hebei Provincial Government to Beiping for consultation. Except for Lin Chengxiu, head of the Department of Construction, who went to Shanghai to attend the Yellow River Disaster Relief Conference, Shi Jinghuan, head of the Department of Industry, returned from an inspection along the Pinghan Railway and is waiting in Beiping. Wei Jian, head of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Zhou Binglin, head of the Department of Education, both went this morning. Yu Xuezhong felt slightly unwell, and his originally scheduled trip to Beiping on the 29th may have to be postponed. Recently, there have been many rumors circulating about the political situation in North China, mostly spread intentionally by ambitious individuals to create an unfavorable atmosphere for others, but in reality, there is no impact. Yin Rugeng returned to Beiping this morning at 6:40 on the Ping-Shen through train. On the night of the 27th, Yin went to the Provincial Government again to meet with Yu Xuezhong to discuss the Yutian negotiation case, and then went to the Japanese Consulate to meet with the Japanese Consul Tanaka for an hour. Regarding the Yutian negotiations, the Provincial Government still tasked Yin with being responsible for the negotiations. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Fu, Chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, telegraphed to the capital, stating that regarding the implementation of the reorganization of the war zone, after the decision to organize a War Zone Reorganization Committee, Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, Li Ze-yi, etc. have been appointed as preparatory committee members. It is only after the official establishment and exchange of views that a negotiation strategy can be decided and negotiations with the Japanese side can begin, so that various problems within the war zone can be quickly resolved. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Provincial Government, due to the Yutian County Magistrate Chen Baosheng and Zunhua County Magistrate Shen Zhongyue's ineffectiveness in arresting Wu Runbi, the murderer in the Gong-Yue case, has extended the ten-day deadline by another five days after it had passed. The two county magistrates, Shen and Chen, will each receive a major demerit. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Following Italy, the Japanese Ambassador is Preparing for an Upgrade</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Now that Italy has upgraded its embassy in China to an embassy, there are rumors that countries such as Britain and France also intend to upgrade theirs. Currently, the general public is paying attention to the case of upgrading the Japanese Minister to China to an ambassador. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' intention regarding the above situation is as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese government has long decided to upgrade its embassy in China to an embassy, has received parliamentary support, and has prepared its budget. It is ready to implement at any time. Furthermore, the current Minister to China is Mr. Arima, who has the qualifications of an Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. However, the decision on this matter will depend on the attitude of the Chinese side. Recently, China's attitude towards Japan has also improved somewhat. Japan expects the Chinese government to sincerely address issues such as thoroughly cracking down on the boycott of Japanese goods and other problems. The upgrade can be carried out at any time depending on how China handles these matters, and there is no disagreement. (28th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Discusses Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>Fu Bingchang Reports on the Content of the New Draft</p>
<p>A Plenary Session Will Continue This Morning for Deliberation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 69th meeting on the 28th. After the routine agenda was completed, at 11:10 AM, the discussion of the draft constitution continued. First, Sun Ke reported that after exchanging views with Wang Chonghui in Shanghai, a new draft had been prepared, with significant revisions to Chapters 3 and 4. The reason for this was that after the original draft was released, there was much criticism from the outside, but there was a misunderstanding: the meanings of "political power" and "governing power" were not distinguished. As a result, governing power was regarded as a trivial matter, and the five Yuan were regarded as trivial institutions. All power belonged to the National Assembly and the National Assembly Committee, and the procedures were complicated and inadequate. After Wang Chonghui returned from Europe, he discussed this with him and also believed that according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, the National Assembly should only exercise political power, and governing power should be completely handed over to the government, so that power would be concentrated and everything would be easier to implement. Later, he went to Lushan with President Wang to meet with Chairman Chiang, and they shared the same view. This time, he went to Shanghai with Fu Bingchang, Lin Bin, and Tao Lujian to talk to Wang again and drafted a new draft. Fu then reported on the content of the new draft. The important changes are: (1) The National Assembly's power of referendum is limited to laws, and the power of referendum on other cases such as budgets, declarations of war, treaties of peace, martial law, and amnesty does not belong to it. (2) The National Assembly Committee is abolished, so Articles 36 to 40 of the original draft are deleted. (3) The Control Yuan's impeachment cases against the President, Vice President, heads of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan, members of the Legislative Yuan, and members of the Control Yuan will be handled by the National Assembly. (4) Matters related to relations between the various Yuan will be decided by the President convening a meeting of the heads of the five Yuan. (5) During the adjournment of the National Assembly, impeachment cases against the President, Vice President, heads of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan will be handled by a joint meeting of the Legislative and Control Yuan, which, with the attendance of more than three-quarters of all members and the approval of more than two-thirds of the members present, will convene a temporary National Assembly to decide whether or not to impeach. (6) After the abolition of the National Assembly Committee, the regulations on supervising the President's exercise of governing power will be transferred to the Legislative Yuan. The powers of the Legislative Yuan will be expanded, equivalent to a parliament, which is inconsistent with the original draft, which was equivalent to a legislative bureau, so Article 48 of the original draft is deleted. In addition, the election of members of the Legislative Yuan takes into account both population and region. It is stipulated that those with a population of less than 10 million will elect 4 people, those with less than 20 million will elect 5 people, those with less than 30 million will elect 6 people, and those with more than 30 million will elect 7 people. Mongolia, Tibet, and overseas will each elect 4 people. The number of candidates for the president of the Legislative Yuan nominated by the National Assembly shall not exceed one-third of the total. However, on the morning of the 28th, President Sun also intended to change it to 3 people for those with a population of less than 10 million, 5 people for those with less than 20 million, 7 people for those with less than 30 million, and 9 people for those with more than 30 million, which would be fairer, for a total of 159 people. Together with the candidates for the president of the Legislative Yuan nominated for decision, there would be a total of 211 people. (7) The original draft did not clearly define the division of political power between the President and the President of the Executive Yuan, so it was changed to a meeting of the Executive Yuan, chaired by the President of the Executive Yuan, making the President of the Executive Yuan the President's representative. (8) After Article 76 of the original draft, one article was added: When the Legislative Yuan is in session, the ministers of the various departments of the Executive Yuan and the chairmen of the various committees shall naturally attend. (9) Article 78 of the original draft is deleted, Article 77 of the original draft is revised in wording, and the date of promulgation of Article 79 is changed to the 30th. (10) During the adjournment of the National Assembly, when the heads of the Judicial and Examination Yuan leave office for some reason, the President shall appoint acting heads of the Yuan with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. When the head of the Control Yuan leaves office, the members of the Control Yuan shall mutually elect an acting head of the Yuan. (11) There are changes to the number of impeachments and joint signatures in Article 107 of the original draft. For the President and Vice President, it is changed to a proposal by 15 or more members of the Control Yuan, a review by more than one-half of all members of the Control Yuan, a decision, and joint signatures. The heads of the various Yuan shall be proposed by 10 or more members of the Control Yuan, and reviewed, decided, and jointly signed by one-third of all members. Members of the Executive Yuan, heads of various departments and committees, members of the Legislative Yuan, and members of the Control Yuan shall be proposed by 5 or more members of the Control Yuan, and reviewed, decided, and jointly signed by 10 or more people. Other civil servants shall be proposed by 3 or more members of the Control Yuan, and reviewed, decided, and jointly signed by 7 or more people. (12) During the adjournment of the National Assembly, impeachment cases against the President, Vice President, heads of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan shall be handled by a joint meeting of the Legislative and Control Yuan, which, with the attendance of more than three-quarters of all members and the approval of more than two-thirds of the members present, will convene a temporary National Assembly to decide whether or not to impeach. (Note: The meaning of this item seems to be a duplication of item (5) above.) (13) The power of the Provincial Assembly has also been slightly changed. (14) Articles 185 and 186 of the Supplementary Provisions propose a compromise between the American and French systems for the interpretation of unconstitutional acts. The wording has not yet been drafted. After Fu's report, Cheng Zhongxing questioned that there was no explanation for the provision in Article 38, Paragraph 6 of the original draft regarding submitting inquiries to the President. Zhu Hezhong said that the new draft had just been issued today, and the members had not studied it yet, so it was not prudent to discuss it immediately, and he advocated submitting it for review first and then bringing it to the general assembly for discussion. Lu Zhiyi, Huang Youchang, and Chen Changheng seconded the motion. Fu expressed that he had no preconceived notions. Sun Ke said that it was not impossible to revise it even after deliberation by the general assembly, and that it would become more and more improved with each revision. Liang Hancao advocated discussing the principles first and then the articles. Li Zhonggong, Gu Zhenggang, and Liu Xuexun agreed with Sun's opinion. It was decided to continue the meeting at 9:00 AM on the 29th for deliberation. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Prisoners Break Out of Jail in Changbai and Resist the Pseudo-Army</h3>
<p>Working Together with Residents to Form a Righteous Army</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In Changbai County, Jilin, in the puppet state, a large number of prisoners, about 300, broke out of jail on the 25th, taking advantage of the guards' lack of preparedness. When the guards tried to stop them, the prisoners relied on their numbers to seize the guns, resulting in a fierce conflict. Twelve guards and one Japanese warden were killed, and two prisoners were killed. The county has now been occupied by the prisoners. The city gates are tightly closed. Hundreds of residents in the city, who have long been oppressed by the Japanese and puppet troops, took the opportunity to join forces with the prisoners to form a righteous army and resist the puppet troops. A unit of Japanese and puppet troops from Panshi has been dispatched to suppress them. (28th Dispatch)</p>

After He departed, he received a telegram from Zhangjiakou yesterday, stating that he had already passed Zhang and was heading to Sui. He will return to Beiping before the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee's general meeting, at which point he will pay his respects in Beiping; otherwise, he will return to Chahar first and then come to Beiping at a later date to pay his respects to He. The situation in eastern Chahar has not changed recently, and there are no disturbances from bandits like in the war zone.

The date for the establishment of the War Zone Reorganization Committee has not been determined. The selection of representatives from the Chahar provincial government is still under consideration because Chahar Province is not a war zone, but it does have diplomatic issues related to the war zone, so this will also be taken into account when selecting personnel.

<h3>Escaped Bandits from Yanshan Pass Suddenly Attack Sanletaizhen</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Erupts with Local Militia and Security Forces</p>
<p>Militia from Ji and Yu Counties Rush to Assist Upon Hearing the News</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 27th, Zhang Renli, the magistrate of Fengrun County, mobilized the county's police and militia, personally leading them to the border between Zunhua and Fengrun counties to prevent the fleeing bandits from Yanshan Pass from entering. On the night of the 27th, approximately two to three hundred bandits who had retreated from Yanshan Pass suddenly attacked Sanletaizhen, located on the border of Ji and Zun counties, engaging in fierce fighting with the Zunhua militia and the security forces under Wang Zhanyuan. Upon hearing the news, the militia from Ji and Yu counties each mobilized a contingent to provide assistance. (28th Daily Special)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 27th, the bandits entrenched in Yanshan Pass were fiercely attacked by the combined forces of the militia and security forces from Zunhua, Ji, and Yutian counties. The bandits initially resisted stubbornly, but as their ammunition ran low, they scattered and fled in several directions. Currently, there are no traces of bandits in Sanletai, Baita, Songxie, and other villages. However, a remnant of approximately two hundred bandits, relying on mountain guns and heavy mortars, have retreated to Zhongjiashan and refuse to flee, confronting the militia and police. However, they are already surrounded, and the matter will be resolved soon. The bandits entrenched in Xiegexhuang, Baitasong, and other villages for several days, looting each village clean. The villagers all fled on the 27th. When the bandits retreated, they set fire to the houses, most of which had not been extinguished by noon on the 27th. On the 27th, the Zun and Ji militia engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits, killing eighteen bandits. Two members of the security forces were killed in action, and several members of the militia were wounded. (28th Daily Special)</p>

Under the combined attack of the militia from Zun, Yu, and Ji counties, many were killed. The remnants retreated to Daquan, resisting stubbornly. Zunhua, Yutian, and Ji counties have essentially been placed under martial law, with militia and police stationed at each county gate, inspecting those entering and leaving. Armed defense teams guard all key roads in the villages. Traffic is cut off within ten li of Shanle Village in Yutian to prevent the bandits from returning. Currently, the bandits have no way to go except to flee to the area outside the pass. (28th Daily Special)</p>
<h3>Huang Musong's Return to Nanjing Undetermined</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi stated that after Huang Musong paid respects to the Dalai Lama, he is currently holding talks with various Tibetan authorities regarding the future relationship between Tibet and the central government. Therefore, the date of his return to Nanjing has not been determined. According to the original schedule, it may be delayed by two months. (28th Daily Special)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Musong previously telegraphed seven suggestions to the central government. According to Shi Qingyang of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission, the central government's views on Special Envoy Huang's suggestions have now been distributed to the relevant departments for review. The issue of delineating the boundary between Kang and Tibet has been handed over to the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission to study in conjunction with the Ministry of the Interior. They will hold discussions and reviews at the beginning of next month. As for the Kang-Tibetan border, since the Sino-British-Tibetan Simla Convention was suspended, disputes over the jurisdiction of Ganzi, Zhanhua, and other counties have continued. Although the Jinsha River is currently used as a temporary boundary, if it is not clearly delineated as soon as possible, unexpected incidents will inevitably arise again in the future. Therefore, the central government is urgently seeking a thorough solution to this issue as soon as possible. It is also reported that Reting hopes that the Sino-Tibetan conference will be reopened soon. (28th Daily Special)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<p>From the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Italy to the Question of Upgrading Diplomatic Missions - Ting</p>
<p>The Italian government recently upgraded its embassy in China, indicating its recognition of China as a major power and its special emphasis. Our country is also preparing to quickly upgrade its embassy in Italy.</p>
<p>Historically, the background of diplomatic relations between China and Italy is unique. The first Western envoys to enter China actually came from Daqin. At that time, it was the ninth year of Emperor Huan of the Later Han Dynasty, 1,768 years ago. Daqin was ancient Rome, and ancient Rome was the predecessor of today's Italy.</p>
<p>Although our country had early contact with Rome, the dispatch of permanent envoys only began in the late Qing Dynasty, in the seventh year of Guangxu (1881). Li Fengbao concurrently served as the minister to Italy, the Netherlands, and Austria, marking the beginning of China's dispatch of envoys to Italy. From then until now, it has been fifty-three years before the mutual dispatch of ambassadors.</p>
<p>According to the resolutions of the Congress of Vienna in 1815, only ambassadors have the qualifications to represent their country's head of state personally, and are therefore highly respected and extraordinary. Their privileges are divided into substantive and formal. The former refers to their privilege to directly discuss official matters with the head of state of the country they are stationed in and to have audiences at any time. The latter refers to the special treatment they receive when presenting their credentials and their priority in serving as the leader of the diplomatic corps in peacetime.</p>
<p>However, at this point in time, the so-called formal privileges are not of great importance. Even substantive privileges no longer have much significant value. In constitutional states, diplomatic power is largely in the hands of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and his policies are often influenced by the legislature. Therefore, the verbal promises of a head of state alone are not sufficient to constitute a national action. Even if diplomatic missions are upgraded, it will not add much. According to the current political systems of China and Italy, neither head of state bears actual administrative responsibility. It can be confidently asserted that the upgrading of diplomatic missions will not lead to a new path for diplomatic negotiations. Therefore, while it may be reasonable to describe the upgrading of diplomatic missions as a sign of closer relations between the two countries, it would be an exaggeration and a reversal of cause and effect to say that this move will create a special and intimate relationship between the two countries.</p>
<p>The upgrading of diplomatic missions, both Chinese and foreign, was pioneered by Soviet Russia and is now being followed by Italy. After this impetus, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Germany may all follow suit. Even if our side remains silent for the time being, if these countries propose it to us, it will be difficult to refuse. This raises practical issues: first, expenses; and second, personnel. Let's discuss them separately.</p>
<p>(1) In ancient times, European countries only dispatched ambassadors. However, due to the emphasis on vanity and mutual competition among the countries, the negative consequence was that the reception and dispatch of envoys fostered extravagance and wastefulness. Small countries could not afford it and began to lower the rank in order to save money. This is probably how ordinary diplomatic missions were established. Since the founding of our country, the personnel sent abroad have been known for their austerity. For example, this year's diplomatic expenses only account for 5.63% of the country's ordinary recurring expenses. Compared with the budget for the 20th year of the Republic, the expenses for embassies and consulates have decreased by more than 1.9 million yuan. If the diplomatic missions in major countries are upgraded all at once, the cost of setting up and decorating the embassies alone would be considerable. Unfortunately, if the upgrading is only in name, while the reality is still impoverished, it would only invite ridicule from foreign countries and further shame the country. Before the United States began dispatching ambassadors, it repeatedly proposed and abandoned the idea due to financial difficulties. If our country is determined to upgrade important diplomatic missions abroad, it is essential to plan for sufficient funds in advance and ensure their use.</p>
<p>(2) The difficulty of finding diplomatic talent has always been the same. This is why Confucius sighed, "If one can recite the three hundred poems but cannot answer appropriately, what use are they even if they are many?" The disintegration of our country's diplomatic ranks has become even more apparent since the national crisis. The shortage of diplomatic talent is undeniable. The British diplomat Lord Sandhurst once said, "Envoys should possess good character, sound physique, beautiful appearance, and, even if they do not possess unparalleled intelligence, they must possess above-average intelligence. They should be well-versed in literature, history, and possess sound judgment." Now, try to use this as a target for selecting envoys. How many people within the country can meet these criteria? Moreover, the status of an ambassador is not something that ordinary envoys can compare to. I once heard the ambassador to the United States say to his staff, "It may not be difficult to upgrade our embassy, but where can we find someone who is qualified to be an ambassador?" Ambassador Shi is indeed an experienced diplomat, and his words are not just casual remarks. Today, due to the upgrading of the embassy in Italy, the selection of the ambassador only concerns one person, making the selection process easier. It is said that the government has already found someone suitable, and they can handle it with ease. However, the qualifications, knowledge, talent, and integrity of those who follow should be strictly limited. They should be promoted gradually from the lowest ranks, step by step. If we can cultivate them carefully according to this standard, aiming for ten to twenty years, then diplomatic talent will emerge in large numbers.</p>
<p>In summary, the Italian government's upgrading of its diplomatic mission in China to express its goodwill towards respecting China is something we should be grateful for. The efforts made by our government authorities regarding this move are also necessary given the current situation. Whether the upgrading of diplomatic missions will actually add anything is a question. However, assuming that the government authorities act according to this policy, they must seriously consider expenses and personnel in order to plan for the long term. It is better to be cautious beforehand than to regret a hasty action later.</p>
<h3>Righteous Army in Southwest of Mishan Battles Japanese Army at Night</h3>
<p>Ten Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded</p>
<p>Zang Shiyi's Elder Brother Escapes After Being Kidnapped</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Jilin unit stationed in Mishan, Jilin Province, received a report that over three hundred "bandits" invaded Banzijiehe (about thirty-five li southwest of Mishan) at 6:30 PM on the 25th. The Hirose unit was immediately dispatched to the area to engage in battle. After fighting for a period of time, the "bandits" were routed. Two Japanese soldiers were killed in action, and eight were seriously or lightly wounded. (28th Electric News)</p>
<p>(Jilin) On the night of September 5th, the residence of Zang Erfeng, the Chief Prosecutor of Jilin Province, was suddenly attacked by "bandits." Zang himself, his eldest son Zang Zhen, and his second son Zang Duo were kidnapped, and valuables worth approximately 5,000 yuan were looted. Zang Erfeng is the elder brother of Zang Shiyi. As a result of the swift pursuit by Japanese and Manchukuo officials, they were discovered south of Jiuyou at noon the next day. After a period of fighting, all of the "bandits" were killed, and Zang Erfeng and his two sons were rescued unharmed. (28th Electric News)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Issues Decree for Concrete Reorganization of the Recovery Administration</h3>
<p>Appointing Two Committees to Oversee the Matter</p>
<p>Lee Shipherd Succeeds Johnson as Leader</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued two decrees at the White House today. These are the first concrete actions taken by the president to reorganize the Recovery Administration. In the first decree, the president appointed a six-member committee, with Lee Shipherd, an advisor to the Recovery Administration, as chairman. After the reorganization, the committee will draft national recovery policies. The second decree appointed a five-member committee to take over the vacancy left by General Johnson. Johnson's resignation will take effect on October 15th. The two committees appointed by the president will share the control formerly exercised by Johnson since the establishment of the National Recovery Administration. The committee led by Lee Shipherd will be the highest authority for deciding recovery policies. The second committee will implement the policies set by the first committee. (27th National Electric)</p>
<p>(New York) The fact that Lee Shipherd will serve as the chairman of the design committee for the Recovery Administration was discussed by Nicer, who is familiar with the affairs of the administration, in an article in the New York Commercial Bulletin today. He stated that the hope that the administration's policies would be overseen by those familiar with the real situation of industry has been completely extinguished. Because all the members of the committee are leftist government officials, the beneficiaries will be laborers, farmers, and consumers. They do not understand industry and will inevitably prioritize their interests. The appointed members have clearly indicated that the government cannot move to the right. Since the executive committee can only implement the policies set by the design committee, the representatives of the industry will have no choice but to be helpless. (27th National Electric)</p>
<p>(Washington) Political and economic experts stated today that President Roosevelt has apparently rejected General Johnson's proposal that the government gradually withdraw its control over private industry. Lee Shipherd's appointment as chairman of the design committee for the Recovery Administration clearly indicates that Roosevelt still intends to control industry through the Recovery Act. Therefore, the proposals of government leaders such as Lee Shipherd and Labor Secretary Perkins have been supported by the president. The design committee has now been authorized by the president to formulate all the policies of the Recovery Administration. It is noteworthy that all the members of the design committee are enthusiastic supporters of the New Deal. (27th National Electric)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently announced the general outline of the plan to reorganize the Economic Recovery Bureau. According to this plan, the Recovery Bureau will lose most of its autonomy and will be subject to closer supervision by cabinet members and the heads of special agencies dealing with industrial, labor, and social issues. President Roosevelt himself retains the power to approve all important decisions. The president has appointed three committees in accordance with this plan. (1) The Industrial Emergency Committee is responsible for formulating general policies and legislative matters regarding economic recovery. The committee has six members, with Lee Shipherd, an advisor to the Economic Recovery Bureau, as chairman. The other members are Interior Secretary Ickes, Labor Secretary Perkins, Agricultural Adjustment Administration Director Davis, Federal Relief Bureau Director Hopkins, and the sixth member is the chairman of the five-member committee below, who will be elected by the committee itself. (2) The five-member committee is responsible for the administrative affairs of the Recovery Act, also known as the National Industrial Recovery Board. It will work under the guidance of President Roosevelt. The members are not well-known, but they have all actively assisted in the organization of the Economic Recovery Bureau. Two of the members are industrialists, Williams and Whiteside. The other two are labor representatives, Hillman, the president of the New York Clothing Workers' Union, and lawyer Marshall. The fifth member is Yale University law professor Hamilton. Roosevelt also appointed Smith, the legal advisor to the Economic Recovery Bureau, and Henderson, the economic advisor, as advisors to the committee for consultation. The committee members will elect the chairman from among themselves. It is likely to be Colonel Lynch, a friend of General Johnson. (3) The third committee is responsible for judicial issues and is responsible for supervising the implementation of the Recovery Bureau's procedures and resolutions. The members have not yet been designated. Since Lee Shipherd is currently serving as the secretary of the Executive Council of the President and the chairman of the National Emergency Committee, and he is now also appointed as the chairman of the Industrial Emergency Committee, he has become the main executor of President Roosevelt's will on various industrial and social issues. (29th Havas Electric)</p>
<p>(Washington) Three thousand women held a meeting in New York today to discuss current issues. President Roosevelt addressed them via radio, saying that the people's attention to national affairs is one of the most optimistic things in the recovery movement. The President also said that the fact that the people can think and act for themselves, and that rumor-mongers cannot cause trouble, is greatly beneficial to the country and is something we should be most grateful for. The President concluded by saying that our people have already taken a firm foothold and are moving forward. The current affairs discussion meeting held by the three thousand women in New York was sponsored by the newspaper and forum. (27th National Electric)</p>
<h3>US Federal Reserve Advisory Council</h3>
<p>Advocates for Restoration of the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Submits Six Proposals</p>
<p>Chicago The Federal Reserve Advisory Council sent a letter to Thomas, Acting Director of the Federal Reserve Board, today, requesting the early restoration of the gold standard, stating that the restoration of the gold standard is a prerequisite for restoring lasting prosperity. The Advisory Council's action today is the same as its recommendation last November. The Advisory Council today advocated the following: (1) Fluctuations in currency hinder commercial development. (2) Formulating a balanced budget is necessary for restoring public trust. (3) Government money should stop competing with private capital. (4) Excessive government debt endangers public credit. (5) The current currency and pledges are sufficient to circulate for commercial expansion, so the demands of the inflationists are completely without sufficient reason. (6) The situation is stable and commerce can recover its original state. (27th National Electric)</p>
<h3>Hoover's New Book Published</h3>
<p>Attacks Roosevelt's New Deal</p>
<p>(New York) Former President Hoover's book, "The Challenge to Liberty," was published here today. Hoover has recently published articles in the Saturday Evening Post, and the book is a supplement to those articles. It severely attacks President Roosevelt's "New Deal," saying that the principles of the "New Deal" have no boundaries, and claiming that Roosevelt is leading the United States down the path to a dictatorship, so that the traditional freedom of the American people has been almost completely deprived. Therefore, he urged the American people to carefully consider the consequences of Congress's complete submission to the President, and asked the people not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Literary critics have reacted coldly to the book, believing that it is too profound for the average person to understand. (27th National Electric)</p>
<h3>The Middle East Railway Deal</h3>
<p>Japan and Russia Agree on Selling Price</p>
<p>The News is Acknowledged by Moscow</p>
<p>Whether a Deal is Reached Depends on Detailed Negotiations</p>
<p>(Moscow) Well-informed sources here acknowledged today that the purchase price of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been agreed upon. However, Moscow views these successful negotiations as a preliminary step for the Soviet Union and the (Manchurian) authorities to reopen formal discussions on the issue. It is said that the recent resumption of negotiations in Tokyo was proposed by the Japanese side, which agreed to pay a higher price than before. The final success of these negotiations, from the Soviet perspective, depends on the outcome of discussions on several details, such as how the purchase price will be paid and how Soviet personnel will be handled in the future. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>France Raises Reservations</p>
<p>The Hague News: Regarding the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway by the Soviet Union, rumors say that Japan and the Soviet Union have reached a basic agreement. Upon receiving this news, financial circles are rumored to say that the French government immediately notified Moscow and Tokyo that it reserves its rights regarding the interests of the French side in the Chinese Eastern Railway. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>British Newspaper Commentary (London) Regarding the possibility of Japan and Russia reaching an agreement on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, The Times, not having received official information, is unwilling to comment. However, it is quite pleased that Japan and Russia have room for compromise, stating: (Although the Soviet Union and Japan have not fully agreed on all points of contention regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway, the main points have been understood, and it seems unlikely that they will break down due to disputes over details. However, to say that Japan and Russia can now be completely aligned would be wishful thinking. The mutual suspicion between the two countries still exists. The Soviet Union has long suspected Japan of harboring territorial ambitions, and Japan and Russia compete with each other in Mongolia, their interests also conflicting. Conversely, Soviet communist propaganda in China, Korea, and even within Japan is enough to worry Japan. All of these things cannot be easily eliminated. What we are fortunate about is that the most intense dispute between the two countries, which could at any time lead to serious incidents in Manchuria, can now be resolved, and the tension in Japanese-Russian relations can be temporarily eased.)</p>
<p>Japanese Business Activities (Tokyo) Once the transfer negotiations for the Chinese Eastern Railway are concluded, part of the payment, approximately 100 million yuan worth of goods, must be transported to Russia. Therefore, many people have been visiting the Soviet Union Trade Agency every day to inquire about the goods needed. Similarly, many have been visiting the Trade Bureau to inquire about methods of selling to the Soviet Union. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has begun to study representative goods and has been in contact with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, intending to establish a new path for Japanese-Russian trade, which has been on the verge of collapse. The goods to be delivered must be selected from the necessities of the Second Five-Year Plan and those that could not be produced during the First and Second Five-Year Plans. At the same time, issues such as credit arrangements, which have been problematic when the Soviet Union purchases Japanese goods, will be fully and concretely addressed. The export industry to Russia will take this opportunity to establish an organization and enjoy the financial convenience of large investment banking groups. Because individual negotiations and discussions are unlikely to be satisfactory, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to establish a Japanese-Russian trade association to ensure fair and appropriate transactions, eliminating partial organizational structures.

<h3>League of Nations Decides Not to Send Additional Personnel to China</h3>
<p>Rajchman Appointed Director of the League of Nations Health Section</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi Describes Achievements of Technical Cooperation</p>
<p>(Geneva) Rajchman, who previously served as a technical advisor to the Chinese government, was appointed today as the director of the League of Nations Health Section for a term of seven years. The Committee on Technical Cooperation with China has decided not to send additional personnel to China, but will send heads of various departments to China when needed. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee on Technical Cooperation between the League of Nations and China met today. After a presentation by Chinese representative Guo Taiqi, it listened to the opinions of various technical agencies of the League of Nations regarding the report submitted by Dr. Rajchman, the League of Nations Liaison Officer for Technical Cooperation with China. Dr. Rajchman submitted this report to the various technical agencies of the League of Nations in accordance with the resolution of the Executive Yuan's Committee on Technical Cooperation between the League of Nations and China on March 17 of this year. The technical agencies will then submit written opinions to the committee and take or prepare to take various measures within their scope of authority to promote technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China. The committee declared that the various technical agencies of the League of Nations are prepared to continue actively assisting this endeavor, as it is given special importance by the Executive Yuan. In addition, the League of Nations Intellectual Cooperation Organization will provide assistance to the job placement services for Chinese intellectuals and technicians. The Chinese government has decided to establish such job placement offices in Nanjing and the West to make it easier for Chinese students studying in Europe and America to obtain vocational training to meet the current needs of China's economic construction. The committee paid particular attention to this fact. As for the League of Nations Health Organization and its experts, they have assisted the Chinese government in implementing a three-year plan established in 1930 to develop the Central Hygiene Facilities Experimental Office and have recently assisted in various health and veterinary projects in the inland provinces. The Transportation and Transit Organization is inclined towards highways and water conservancy, cooperating with the Chinese National Economic Council. A team of experts appointed by the Transportation and Transit Organization will soon go to the interior of China at the request of the Chinese government to conduct a thorough investigation of several issues related to water conservancy and highways. Dr. Rajchman's report stated that, with the exception of a few specialized departments, the number of Chinese citizens suitable for participating in the country's economic construction is increasing daily. The committee, upon hearing this, believes that if the Chinese government and its experts can make the most of other countries' administrative and institutional experience, this progress can be accelerated. Finally, the task assigned to Dr. Rajchman, the League of Nations Liaison Officer for Technical Cooperation with China, expired on August 1 of this year. He returned to his original position as Director of the Health Section of the League of Nations Secretariat. The committee specifically approved this and thanked Dr. Rajchman for his excellent performance. The committee believes that it is not yet necessary to appoint a technical liaison officer to succeed Rajchman at this time, but requests the League of Nations Secretariat to take necessary measures to ensure the continued development of various technical cooperation projects.

<h3>Britain, France, and Italy Issue Joint Declaration on Austrian Affairs</h3>
<p>Austrian Independence as a Common Standard of Policy for the Three Countries</p>
<p>The Little Entente Countries Will Study This Declaration at Length</p>
<p>(Geneva) Britain, France, and Italy have been consulting for a long time on the issue of jointly guaranteeing Austrian independence. Tonight, the three countries jointly issued a declaration stating (The representatives of France, Britain, and Italy have re-examined the situation in Austria).</p>
<p>Afterwards, they mutually agreed to recognize, in the name of their respective governments, the declaration issued on February 17, 1934, by the three countries to maintain Austrian independence and territorial integrity, which remains fully effective and continues to be the common standard of policy for the three countries). (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Britain, France, and Italy signed a joint declaration today, reaffirming the three countries' determination to maintain the independence and territorial integrity of Austria, thus giving more force to the three countries' statement of February 17th of this year. The declaration was signed by British Minister Lord Earl, French Foreign Minister Barthou, and Italian Count Aloisi. Britain and France had already agreed on the content of the declaration yesterday, but it was delayed until today pending Italian approval. Although the declaration does not specify which country it is aimed at, it is internally aimed at Germany. However, there is much speculation as to what extent it will be implemented. (National, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The British government's willingness to sign the tripartite declaration was due to the special request of French Foreign Minister Barthou. Barthou expressed great satisfaction with Britain's decision, as this move could dispel all rumors of discord between Britain, France, and Italy on the Austrian issue. The declaration has now been sent to the Little Entente countries, and those who wish to join may also sign it. It is generally believed that the three countries' compromise on Austria is timely, as the current session of the League of Nations Assembly will end tomorrow. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Czech Foreign Minister Benes declared that the joint declaration issued by Britain, France, and Italy to guarantee Austrian independence is based on the statement of February 17 of this year. He also said that the Little Entente countries will study this declaration at length and consider how to participate in this declaration in the future. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Vienna: The semi-official Federal Postal Gazette here published an important article, which is generally believed to be written by Prime Minister Schuschnigg. The article reviews the truth of the negotiations on the Austrian independence issue in Geneva, stating that this matter was not initiated by Austria and that Austria has always been passive in this matter. The article states that Austria's movement for independent autonomy to determine its future has not been affected and that Austria will never forget that another Germanic nation and its foreign policy must be in harmony with the beliefs held by the Austrian people. This is the first time that doubts have been expressed here about Italy's interests in Austrian diplomacy. (National, 27th)</p>
<p>Vienna: People in Vienna, except for the Pan-Germanists, are satisfied with the joint declaration on Austrian independence issued by Britain, France, and Italy in Geneva. The Wiener Zeitung stated that the declaration in Geneva is a clear and forceful warning to anyone who wants to violate Austria. The Neue Wiener Tagblatt stated that foreign politicians have given endless benefits to European peace with clear words and strong postures, for which we should be grateful. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Poland Does Not Participate in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact</h3>
<p>Reply Sent to the French Government</p>
<p>However, the Door to Negotiations Is Not Closed</p>
<p>(Geneva) Poland's reply to the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact issue has now been sent to the French government. Its content is merely a written summary of the talks between Barthou and Beck, which cannot be made public at present. The content of the reply roughly states that Poland cannot approve of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact in its current form. The document also lists the treaties Poland has signed with France, Germany, and the Soviet Union, stating that Poland's foreign policy seeks to establish friendly relations with various European countries. As for whether the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact can provide Poland with greater security, the Polish government has doubts about this. However, negotiations can still be conducted in the future. This reply does not close the door to negotiations. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Ecuador Joins the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Membership Now at Sixty Countries</p>
<p>(Geneva) Ecuador officially joined the League of Nations today, bringing the League's membership to sixty countries, the highest number since the League's establishment. The 82nd session of the League of Nations Executive Council was declared closed. (National, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council met this morning. League of Nations Secretary General Avenol announced that the United States and Ecuador have decided to join the League of Nations. Ecuador is one of the founding member states listed in the Covenant of the League of Nations attached to the Treaty of Versailles, so Ecuador's accession to the League of Nations does not require any further procedures. Representatives from Mexico, Chile, and Portugal, as well as the acting chairman of the Executive Council, Czech Ambassador to France Ossusky, spoke, expressing their satisfaction with Ecuador's accession. At this point, the Ecuadorian representative entered the meeting hall and declared that his country was deeply pleased to join the League of Nations and contribute to the cause of peace. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Executive Council Discusses Saar Issue</h3>
<p>And Begins Negotiations with Germany</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Issues Declaration</p>
<p>Does Not Give Up Its Rights</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Barthou announced today at a meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council that France would not hesitate to send a large army into the Saar region to maintain order. Barthou usually spoke extemporaneously, but this time he read from a prepared text, so his remarks were particularly emphasized. Barthou said that France had not given up any of its rights in the Saar, but would naturally abide by the results of the plebiscite to be held next year in the Saar region. If the Saar Governing Commission cannot guarantee the fairness of the plebiscite due to insufficient police force, the French government is prepared to provide it. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council convened a meeting today to discuss the Saar issue. First, Aloisi, Chairman of the Committee of Three, submitted a report on the preparations for the Saar region's vote of self-determination to the General Assembly. Aloisi stated that an increase in security forces during the open vote next year is necessary to maintain public order at that time. Therefore, the Committee of Three needs to request additional funding from both Germany and France. French Foreign Minister Barthou then rose and delivered a very long declaration, stating that the Committee's work is divided into two major parts: one is the preparation for the open vote, and the other is the various issues after the vote. Barthou also stated that it is regrettable that a suitable solution has not yet been found regarding the issue of maintaining public order in the Saar region and that the situation in the Saar is very serious, as discovered by the League of Nations Governing Commission. Barthou continued, stating that France is deeply concerned about this matter because France may inevitably have to assume special responsibilities as future events unfold. Therefore, if this danger is to be avoided, the Saar Governing Commission must have sufficient financial resources to expand its security forces. The people in the Saar region must first understand, before the vote, what the effects will be if they support maintaining the status quo. Barthou insisted that it is the responsibility of the League of Nations Council to make the people in the Saar region understand this point, and that this work is urgent because the voters in the Saar region must understand the meaning of each solution as soon as possible. Therefore, Barthou advocated that this issue must be addressed at an extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations convened in China in November. (National, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations and Germany began negotiations today on the Saar problem, hoping to reach a practical compromise on the issue in November of this year. At the same time, the work of the League of Nations Executive Council in reviewing the report of the Saar Governing Commission concluded this afternoon, and it was decided to convene another special meeting of the Executive Council on November 15 to deal with this matter. Among the various minor issues discussed with Germany so far, the most difficult is the recruitment of police to maintain order during the plebiscite. Germany strongly argued that there is no need to recruit police from outside the region, and if the Executive Council insists on recruiting them, Germany cannot be held responsible for the consequences. However, the League of Nations also did not show weakness on this point, firmly intending to implement the request of Knox, Chairman of the Saar Governing Commission. Knox previously applied to the League of Nations Executive Council on the 14th of this month to recruit 2,000 police officers from foreign countries to strengthen the Saar's police force, as the Saar currently has only 1,000 police officers, which is not enough to dispatch during the plebiscite.

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Formally Decides to Convene Extraordinary Diet Session</h3>
<p>Date of Convocation Not Determined</p>
<p>Scope of Proposals Limited to Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Anti-Counterfeiting Reform Bill May Not Be on the Agenda</p>
<p>Hirota Will Explain Diplomatic Policy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's regular cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence at 10:20 AM. After all cabinet members, including Prime Minister Okada, were present, Minister of Home Affairs Goto first reported in detail on the state of the disaster in the Kansai region, which took about 55 minutes. He then argued that because the disaster was so severe, an extraordinary Diet session must be convened to establish relief measures. Next, Prime Minister Okada reported on the details of his meeting with Seiyukai President Suzuki yesterday, as well as the wishes of the Democratic Political Party members elected from the Kyoto-Osaka region. Then, Minister of Education Matsuda and Minister of Commerce and Industry Machida reported that they plan to visit the disaster areas. Minister of Finance Fujii also stated that he is preparing to provide low-interest funds for the reconstruction and relief of the disaster areas. Minister of Railways Tokonami advised that the government should make this fact clear to both domestic and foreign parties. Finally, Prime Minister Okada asked each cabinet member to express their opinions on the issue of convening an extraordinary Diet session. The cabinet members were unanimous in their opinion that it must be convened, and the following was decided:</p>
<p>(1) National survey on those most urgent disaster countermeasures, while the Extraordinary Diet session is opened. (2) Emergency measures that can be implemented without Diet approval should be implemented immediately. (3) Regarding the provision of low-interest funds, it must be stated that there is an urgent and appropriate purpose. (Dentsu, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government has now decided to convene an extraordinary Diet session. Taking this opportunity, Foreign Minister Hirota will widely appeal to national public opinion regarding the Japanese government's diplomatic policy, expecting its overall support. He plans to explain in detail the progress of Japan's important diplomatic issues since the ordinary Diet session this spring and clarify the Japanese government's diplomatic policy both domestically and abroad. The main points of the Foreign Minister's speech are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The situation of deciding on naval disarmament preparatory measures. (2) The issue of notifying the termination of the Washington Treaty. (3) Negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (4) Japan-Netherlands consultations and matters related to general trade.</p>
<p>In addition to explaining the above situation, he will especially focus on the naval conference and the determination to establish peace among Japan, Britain, and the United States. Also, regarding the recent frequent rumors about Japan-Soviet relations, he must strictly clarify the diplomatic policy towards the Soviet Union and other aspects of the renewal of diplomatic policy towards China, which will be noted by the general public. (Nichi-Ren, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government will only discuss emergency relief measures for typhoon and drought-stricken areas and poor sericulture areas at the extraordinary Diet session. Regarding the reform of organizations in Manchuria, although the Army and the House of Peers hope to implement it quickly, it is questionable whether it can be prepared due to legalization and budgetary considerations. Whether it is as urgent as the former is also debatable, so its decision will inevitably cause considerable waves, and deliberation will also take a considerable amount of time. Also, rice countermeasures should be carefully deliberated by the ordinary Diet in nature, so it is also unwilling to put it on the agenda of the extraordinary Diet session. (Dentsu, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the date of convening the extraordinary meeting, Minister of Finance Fujii stated at the cabinet meeting on the 28th that it would be difficult to convene it in mid-October due to administrative reasons, but the opinion of holding the meeting earlier was prevalent. If it is factually permissible, it would be most convenient to convene it in early November before the grand maneuvers. In any case, it will be decided after investigating the state of typhoon damage. The opinion of shortening the meeting period as much as possible is also prevalent, and it is roughly expected to be within 10 days, which is the confirmed situation. (Nichi-Ren, 28th)</p>
<h3>British Miners' Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>(London) According to tonight's announcement, the dispute involving 130,000 miners in the South Wales coal region has been temporarily resolved. This is the result of a day-long discussion between Minister of Mines Brown and representatives of both sides. Brown, representing the government, put forward some suggestions in order to remove obstacles, which have now been compromised, but still need to be approved by the legitimate authorities of both sides. Lord President of the Council Baldwin and Minister of Commerce Runciman are both in London today, in close contact with the progress of the negotiations. The miners' representatives are returning to Cardiff tonight to report everything to the general meeting convened by the Miners' Federation tomorrow, and it is expected that the general meeting will accept their proposals. The content of the solution has not been officially announced, but it is heard that an arbitration committee will be established to review the miners' wage demands. The future decisions of the arbitration committee will be implemented from October 1. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Seamen's Strike Successfully Resolved</h3>
<p>The Kobe Maritime Association Special Committee met at 2:00 PM yesterday. Representatives of the seamen and shipowners were present to review the demands put forward by the Seamen's Union. Both labor and management adopted a concessionary attitude. As a result, the main parts of the proposals were recognized by the Yusen, Shosen, and coastal companies. The articles were immediately prepared, and they were unanimously approved at 8:00 PM. Thus, the serious issue of the seamen's strike was successfully resolved. (Nichi-Ren, 28th)</p>
<h3>Hopeman's Re-trial: Lindbergh Attends Court</h3>
<p>(New York) Hopeman, the suspect in the kidnapping and murder of Colonel Lindbergh's young son, was re-arraigned today. The courtroom was packed, and the street in front of the courthouse was even blocked. Lindbergh himself, in disguise, also attended court, closely guarded by police detectives, to observe Hopeman's face before the trial began. According to Prosecutor Foley, Lindbergh firmly believes Hopeman is the kidnapper. However, Lindbergh did not witness the kidnapping, nor was he present when the ransom was paid. It is unknown what his belief is based on. Today's hearing concerns Hopeman's alleged extortion; the murder charge has not yet been addressed. (National Press Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Hit by Gale and Torrential Rain</h3>
<p>Typhoon Shifts, Strikes Annam Coast</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hong Kong was hit by gale-force winds and torrential rain late on the 27th. The seas were turbulent. The intensity began to subside slightly on the morning of the 28th.

<h3>Reason for the Return of Hot Weather</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Nanjing Meteorological Institute, since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been gradually cooling. However, on the 28th, it suddenly became hot again, humid, and foggy. The highest temperature was 90.05 degrees Fahrenheit. This is due to a low-pressure system situated over the lower reaches of the Yellow River, while a high-pressure system from the Pacific Ocean has extended into southeastern China. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River are within the range of both pressure systems, resulting in southerly and southeasterly winds, few clouds, and strong sunshine, creating muggy conditions. A hurricane was recently discovered in the Pacific Ocean, south of the Philippines. Whether it will affect China's coastal areas depends on whether its direction changes. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Cotton and Wheat:</p>
<p>New York cotton market: today (September 28), the cotton market opened with ups and downs of one pound each. At 10:30, it fell 45 pounds because spot merchants sold more and hedging also increased. At 10:40, the recent period recovered one pound.</p>
<p>New York wheat market: Due to poor news from Argentina and a lack of buyers, the wheat market opened down 50 to 75. But when the telegram was sent, the price was 25 to 3375 higher than the opening price.</p>
<p>Bombay cotton market: Today, the cotton market initially rose due to speculative buying and short covering, but then fell due to selling by European exporters and profit-taking by longs. Sentiment was still stable. The price for white cotton for the April-May period was 210 rupees 75, down two rupees.</p>
<p>Liverpool cotton market: today, the price for the January futures contract was 6.66, which was two pounds lower than yesterday's closing price.</p>

<p>New York: London's telegrams were good, so the rubber market opened here, rising 8 to 13 pounds. Subsequently, due to profit-taking by longs, the price fell 1 to 6 pounds. When the telegram was sent, the December contract recovered 5 pounds.</p>
<p>Securities:</p>
<p>New York: Before the opening today, the factors favoring market conditions were: (1) The newly announced regulations on margin requirements for securities transactions are generally considered lenient, and some people say that, according to the methods stipulated in the new regulations, the amount of margin already paid is mostly excessive. (2) It is expected that President Roosevelt's speech on Sunday will be beneficial to market conditions, so sentiment is quite good. The unfavorable factor for market conditions is the instability of the government bond market. This morning, when securities opened, market conditions were narrow and uneven. Because the price rose yesterday, there was some speculative profit-taking this morning. Steel stocks were particularly under pressure. But everyone expects the rally to resume soon. The report for the first half of the year for the Anaconda Copper Mining Company estimates that the net profit for the first six months of this year was 2.986 million yuan, or 3.4 jiao per share. The New York stock market prices are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Great Disaster in Kansai Caused by Hurricane (Japanese News)</h3>
<p>Wind Speed of Sixty Meters</p>
<p>Seven Prefectures Affected</p>
<p>At around 8:00 AM on September 21st, a hurricane struck the skies over Osaka City (a wind speed of over 30 meters is considered a hurricane). The speed was at least 40 meters and at most 60 meters. It was the most severe natural disaster since the Great Kanto Earthquake. When the hurricane struck, the sea tide also rose, and turbid currents ten feet high surged through the coastal areas. The local residents were shocked by the wind damage and also flooded. Fathers and sons were lost to each other, husbands and wives were separated, houses collapsed, and traffic was completely cut off. After 10:00, the gale gradually subsided, but Osaka, a place of brocade finery and towering smokestacks, truly a Japanese industrial center, instantly turned into the hell of wind and water.</p>
<p>According to a subsequent survey, the most severely affected areas were Osaka, followed by Kyoto, and then Hyogo, Kochi, Tottori, Ehime, and Okayama prefectures. When the hurricane occurred, it was during school hours, and most school buildings were not constructed very solidly, so they were easily damaged. This time, the number of collapsed school buildings was 146, with 528 deaths. Counting injured and missing teachers and students, there were a total of 2,245 people. The number of completely collapsed residences was 4,135 households. Counting partially collapsed houses, there were a total of 12,255 households. The total number of completely and partially collapsed non-residential buildings was 16,565. There were also 40 temples, shrines, government offices, etc. that were damaged. In total, the number of casualties was 4,650. One city tram was overturned, along with three trains. 1,627 large and small boats were lost.</p>
<p>In Kyoto Prefecture, 1,500 people were killed or injured. A total of 2,600 houses collapsed. Over 1,700 households were swept away or flooded.</p>
<p>In Hyogo Prefecture, 42,000 houses were flooded, and 1,677 households collapsed. There was damage to embankments at 146 locations. There were over 600 casualties, three landslides, 17 ships in distress, and 2,200 fishing boats. The other prefectures suffered relatively less damage and will not be described in detail.</p>
<p>Osaka is the industrial area of Japan, and (Konohana Ward), (Taisho Ward), and (Minato Ward) are the industrial zones of Osaka. All factories suffered major damage. However, the structure of the factories is very complex, especially military industries, so it is very difficult to calculate accurately. Moreover, there is a special secret military relationship among them. However, based on a general estimate, the losses in the factory areas of the aforementioned locations will be at least 300 million yen. The factories flooded in Konohana Ward, such as Liquid Air, Toyo Wood Preserving (drift loss), Osaka Iron, Sumitomo Copper Extrusion Steel Pipe, Sumitomo Steel, Sumitomo Electric Wire, Japan Dyestuff, Osaka Steel, Fuji Paper, Ajikawa Iron Works, Toa Iron Works, Osaka Leather Belt, Takeda Pharmaceutical, and Dai Nippon Artificial Fertilizer, etc., are mostly related to military industrial needs. The factories flooded in the Taisho Ward area include Toyo Spinning, Toyota Loom Casting, Fukan Steel Pipe, Osaka Steel Bar, Nakayama Steel, Imperial Artificial Fertilizer, and Hata Shipbuilding, etc. There were 800 flooded factories, and over 400 other small factories. About 80 factories belonging to Amagasaki were flooded, and production capabilities were almost completely paralyzed. Military industrial needs will naturally be affected, and exports will also be hit.</p>
<p>Overall, the total losses will probably exceed 500 million yen. Such a natural disaster cannot be said to be small. However, when we recall the Great Kanto Earthquake, the losses in major cities such as Tokyo and Yokohama were over 1 billion yen, accounting for one-tenth of Japan's national wealth. However, after five years, recovery was gradually seen. This wind disaster in Osaka is indeed very large, and the people have naturally suffered deeply, even to the point that it may affect Japan's overall national strength. However, there are several things in the midst of this that are worthy of our attention. First, the disaster relief measures of the Osaka City Government were extremely rapid. The activities of the police and the investigation of the disaster areas were unusually fast, and the accommodation of refugees was also very thorough. The city government immediately allocated 900,000 yuan for emergency expenses, which is something that should be done. Private donations for disaster relief were also significant. The Sumitomo financial group, with Sumitomo Kichizaemon, donated 1 million yuan for relief, which is already commendable. The Osaka Asahi Shimbun newspaper alone collected over 260,000 yuan in donations within three days. From this, we can see the enthusiasm of the Japanese people for disaster relief and the spirit of the entire country to overcome difficulties. Clenching their teeth and striving forward to overcome the forces of nature is indeed worthy of our attention. Looking westward at the motherland compatriots who are suffering many hardships, we should redouble our efforts! (September 24th, Osaka, Kita Ward)</p>
<h3>American Journalist Group Discusses with Japanese Army Minister the Issue of Japanese Troops Stationed in Manchuria</h3>
<p>American Journalists Believe it Contradicts the Independence of Manchukuo</p>
<p>Army Minister Hayashi Deems Withdrawal Impossible Under Current Conditions</p>
<p>The Nagoya Shimbun of Japan reported on the 23rd that Lowell Millett and ten other American journalists, after arriving in Tokyo, visited Army Minister Hayashi at 2:50 PM on the 22nd. They were translated by Motoyoshi Sada and spoke with Army Minister Hayashi for about an hour. The general situation was as follows: (1) American journalist Drummond asked, "The entire news group feels that the permanent stationing of Japanese troops in Manchuria greatly contradicts the independent nature of (Manchukuo)." Army Minister Hayashi replied, "The stationing of Japanese troops in Manchuria is due to the rampant banditry throughout Manchuria."</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>"The Manchurian army does not yet have the ability to suppress them, and internal governance and national defense are not yet secure. Therefore, under the current conditions, the stationing of Japanese troops in Manchuria is necessary." (2) American journalist White asked, "According to your opinion, to what extent will Japanese troops need to be stationed in Manchuria in the future before they can withdraw?" Hayashi replied, "We will wait until the country is pacified and the Manchurian army is strong enough to resist foreign enemies. In my opinion, the training of the Manchurian army will still require a considerable period of time. The withdrawal of Japanese troops will be at least one or two years later." (3) White asked again, "Can the Japanese government not determine the time for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Manchuria in advance?" Hayashi replied, "From the standpoint of joint defense by Japan and Manchuria, a unanimous opinion from both Japan and (Manchukuo) is required before a decision can be made."</p>
<h3>Hebei Province War Zone Reorganization Problem</h3>
<p>Reorganization Committee Can Be Established Soon</p>
<p>Difficulties Still Exist in Handling the Miyakoshi Case and Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the issue of the (war zone) reorganization, since the authorities decided to organize a (war zone) reorganization committee, the organization plan and the selection of committee members have been drafted by Huang Fu, the chairman of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee. According to official sources, the establishment of the committee will be announced soon. The list of committee members will be announced by the Political Reorganization Committee in the form of an instruction. Although it is currently impossible to speculate on the exact number of members, it is a fact that representatives will be sent by seven organizations, including the Military Sub-Committee, the Political Reorganization Committee, the Hebei Provincial Government, the Luanyu District Public Office, the Jimi District Public Office, the Chahar Provincial Government, and the Beijing-Shenyang Railway Bureau.</p>
<p>As for the issue of the war zone, there are currently two matters that make the authorities unable to rest day and night: dealing with the Yutian Miyakoshi case and suppressing the bandits disturbing Yutian County. Regarding the former, although the truth about Miyakoshi's accidental killing has been jointly investigated by China and Japan, the Japanese side stated that it could not be compared with the Qian'an Fushan Temple incident, arguing that Miyakoshi was a comprador for the Japanese army stationed in Malanyu.</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, due to various practical considerations on our side, and the special circumstances of the so-called demilitarized zone, the suppression of bandits within the (war zone) is fraught with difficulties. The incident of the "Old Rat" occupying Funing County in the autumn of last year can serve as proof of how difficult it is for us to thoroughly suppress the bandits in Yutian today. This view can hardly be denied. Therefore, the authorities believe that, on the one hand, unfortunate incidents in the (war zone) should be prevented in the future, and on the other hand, the source of bandits in the (war zone) should be completely eliminated. This cannot be achieved without the early implementation of the (war zone) reorganization.</p>
<p>Huang Fu consulted with Li Zeyi last night (the 26th) and this morning (the 27th) on how to deal with the Miyakoshi case. By noon, a considerable decision had been made. Li left Beiping for Tianjin at around 4:00 p.m. that afternoon. It is understood that Li will begin negotiations with the Japanese side on this case. It is generally speculated that a satisfactory result can be obtained after a round of negotiations, and the situation will not escalate.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of suppressing the Yutian bandits, the authorities have also made a decision. The first step is naturally to establish the (war zone) reorganization committee as soon as possible, so as to start implementing the reorganization. Once the (war zone) can be reorganized, it will not be difficult to suppress and eliminate the few hundred bandits. If the (war zone) can be reorganized smoothly, all disputes will naturally be reduced. Relevant parties have indicated that the Yutian Miyakoshi incident can be easily resolved, and the Yutian bandits can also be easily suppressed, provided that the Japanese side sincerely fulfills its promises and does not hinder our work in reorganizing the (war zone), so that the task can be accomplished successfully.

<h3>Bandit Alarm on the Border of Zunhua and Yutian in Hebei Province</h3>
<p>Bandits Carry Heavy Firearms</p>
<p>Villages Are Burned and Killed Horribly</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Hebei Provincial Government received telegrams today from Chen Baosheng, the magistrate of Yutian County, and Shen Zhongyu, the magistrate of Zunhua County, stating that at 3:00 p.m. on the 24th, a group of bandits, numbering about 300, crossed the border from Ji County into the border area of Yutian and Zunhua, occupying Daxiaolizhuang. They burned, killed, looted, and raped women. More than a dozen nearby villages were subjected to banditry. Villagers were confined and forbidden from leaving their homes. The bandits ordered them to point out where their valuables were. Some villagers risked their lives to escape to Zunhua County to report the incident. The magistrate, Shen Zhongyu, personally led the Third District Chief of the Security Team, Ma Jianchi, and the District Captain, Sun Ying, to assist Wang Zhanyuan's unit of the Third Battalion of the War Zone Security Force to encircle and suppress the bandits at 6:00 p.m. that day. At the same time, the Yutian County and Ji County militias also sent teams to block the bandits. At 7:00 p.m. that night, they began to engage the bandits. Because the bandits had two mortars, two mountain guns, several machine guns, and all kinds of large and small firearms, they resisted without retreating and threatened the national police with burning the entire village if they attacked. More than a thousand militiamen and police officers gathered and fought fiercely all night. By 7:00 a.m. on the 25th, the bandits could not hold out and retreated towards the Yanshan Pass. Wang Zhanyuan's security team immediately pursued them. According to another report from the Provincial Government, this group of bandits is still a secret unit secretly gathered by Shi Yousan and Liu Guitang. Therefore, their equipment is far from being as crude and uneven as that of ordinary bandits. The heavy firearms possessed by the bandits, in addition to the machine guns supplemented by Shi and Liu, the mortars and mountain guns were carried out during the mutiny of the puppet troops of Zhang Haipeng in Rehe. Shi and Liu lured them to join the bandit gang. The Provincial Government immediately telegraphed Ji, Zun, Qian, Yu, and Feng five counties to step up the search and suppression, in order to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Bandits with neat firearms were also found 20 li southeast of Funing County on the 24th. It is rumored that they were also former subordinates of Shi Yousan and Liu Guitang. Lou Yuying, the commander of the First Security Regiment, sent a team to search and suppress them, capturing their ringleader, Wang Mou, and more than a dozen accomplices. The rest of the bandits scattered and disappeared. In other counties in the war zone, many groups of bandits, claiming to be troops or brigades of a certain puppet unit, have also been found disturbing the area. The authorities are afraid that the bandit alarm incident of Qi Wenping, the "Old Rat," last year will happen again in eastern Hebei, so they secretly ordered the three security regiments compiled by the province and the militia book teams of various counties to strictly defend the territory. Yesterday, it was also heard that Liu Guitang and Shi Yousan secretly sent many people along the Beijing-Shenyang Railway line to set up puppet military offices everywhere for intelligence and liaison work. Their locations are all in foreign firms run by Japanese and Korean ruffians selling drugs. The authorities have ordered the responsible agencies in various places to secretly investigate and report, so as to prevent them. It is said that Shi Yousan is planning to go to Changchun with Kawashima Yoshiko and a certain Japanese person within a few days to make contact with the puppet organization. (25th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Organizations in the Hebei War Zone</h3>
<p>Government Cannot Interfere</p>
<p>Traitors Establish Branches</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: According to visitors from Tangshan, recently, reactionary elements, taking advantage of the special environment of the war zone, have recklessly opened up new fronts, organizing so-called puppet organizations such as the "Humanitarian Love Society" and the "Revive Manchuria Society," secretly engaging in activities and plotting wrongdoing. The so-called Humanitarian Love Society has its headquarters in a foreign concession in Tianjin, with branches in various parts of the war zone. Each branch has two directors. In Tangshan, it is called the Tangshan Second Branch of the North China Branch of the Humanitarian Love Society. The director, Sheng Guocai, and the deputy director, Liu Rudong, are secretly guided by the chairman of the Tangshan Residents' Association of a certain country, and are allocated funds. Members fill out application forms and are introduced by two or more people, pay a membership fee of two yuan, and are issued a wooden plaque and a copper badge each. If there is any illegal activity, the military police of a certain country will handle it with extraterritorial rights. Local government offices cannot directly intervene. Therefore, the society has developed very rapidly, and most of its members are lowlifes who do nothing good on weekdays. Among the traitors who have joined are Yao Mingshan, Liu Shaotang, Han Caizhang, Geng Zixiang, Cheng Yushan, Cui Zhen, Gao Junpeng, Gu Lanting, and more than ten others. The so-called Revive Manchuria Society is affiliated with the Love Society and is extremely secretive in its organization, containing the greatest political purpose. It is divided into three detachments in the war zone, all under the secret leadership of a certain country, and funds are allocated monthly by a certain country. It is said that the first detachment is stationed in Yuguan, with the detachment leader, Qi Longwu, recruiting party members and forming a uniform team of about 2,000 people, with 300 guns and 15,000 rounds of ammunition. The second detachment is stationed in Luan County, with the detachment leader, Han Shutian, having recruited about 3,000 traitors in Qian'an, Chengde, Laoting, Luan County, and other places, and has formed a plainclothes team of 2,000 people, with 400 guns and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition. The third detachment is stationed in Tangshan, with its headquarters in Yutian, with the detachment leader, Zhao Dazhong, recruiting four to five thousand vagrants, obtaining 200 pistols and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition, as well as 500 wooden fake guns. Although their current activities are very active, it is quite difficult for them to take action due to the strict precautions taken by the Hebei Security Team and local police militias, who are arresting them everywhere.

<h3>Confucius Clan in Qufu Plans to Publish "Qufu Series"</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Recently, reports that the Japanese are persuading Kong Decheng, the Duke Yansheng of Qufu, to go to Japan have attracted attention from all parties. It is said that in recent years, the Japanese, Badie, have repeatedly persuaded Kong to go to Japan. This move did not start today and has been rejected. The Confucius clan will issue a declaration stating that they will never participate in the Japanese Confucius ritual. Furthermore, the Confucius clan plans to publish the "Qufu Series" and asks the government to reorganize the Confucius sacrificial fields, which are now underway. The details are as follows: Japanese Persuade Kong Decheng to Go to Japan</p>
<p>Recent reports stated that the Japanese plan to persuade Kong Decheng, the Duke Yansheng of Qufu, and his uncle, Kong Lingcan, to go to Japan to participate in the spring ceremony. The Confucius clan has already stated that they will definitely not participate. It is said that the instigation of this matter did not start today. After the September 18th Incident, in addition to swallowing our Northeast, a certain Japanese person went to Qufu to persuade Kong Decheng to go to Japan, saying that Japan has always respected Confucius, that the Confucius Temple in Tokyo is being extensively repaired, and that a Confucius ceremony will be held next spring. He invited him to go east to participate and offered generous treatment. The Confucius clan replied that Confucius's way is universal and does not distinguish between national boundaries. While they are grateful that your country respects Confucius, given the recent relationship between China and Japan, it is really inconvenient to go. They politely declined. Afterwards, anyone who went there was not received. Recently, the Japanese Toyota requested an audience and was also rejected. Also, on Confucius's birthday this year, representatives from the National Government and the Provincial Government went to Qufu to pay their respects. Six Japanese people requested to participate in the ceremony. The Confucius Mansion replied that your country can come to visit, but it would be difficult to comply if you participate in the ceremony at the same time as the government representatives. The Japanese people left in dismay. Their various methods are like this, and it is not known what other tricks will appear in the future.</p>
<p>Kong Decheng Denies Going to Japan</p>
<p>Kong Decheng, the Duke Yansheng, and his clan members published an announcement in the newspapers in Jinan, stating that they would never go to Japan. The original text is as follows: (The New Tianjin News of September 22 and the Yongbao of the same day reported that the Tokyo United Telegram of the 21st stated that the newly renovated Confucius Temple in Japan will be completed and a commemorative meeting will be held in April next year, inviting Kong Decheng, the 77th generation descendant of Confucius, and his uncle, Kong Lingcan, to participate. Decheng was very surprised after reading it. Decheng and his uncle, Kong Lingcan, had never heard of this matter. If there is an invitation at that time, Decheng and the members of our clan will definitely not participate. We hereby publish this statement. Kong Decheng and the members of the Kong clan jointly announce.)</p>
<p>Plans to Publish the Qufu Series</p>
<p>After the Confucius birthday ceremony in Qufu this year, the Confucius clan sent representatives to Jinan to express their gratitude and to discuss the renovation of the Confucius Temple and the publication of books. The Confucius Mansion in Qufu has many books, some of which have been published and are not widely circulated and need to be reprinted, and some of which have not yet been engraved. The Confucius clan intends to compile and publish them all at once to spread them widely, naming it the "Qufu Series." However, due to the lack of capital, they plan to ask the government to lend them some money first, sell the books, and then repay the loan. The Provincial Government is very concerned about preserving ancient books and may approve it in the future. There are many kinds of series. As far as we know, there are Kong Jihan, whose courtesy name is Honggu, "The Writings of the Weiboshe" and the unpublished manuscripts of Weiboshe (Kong lived during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty and was contemporary with Dai Dongyuan. There is also the Weiboshe Series, which is printed together with Dai's posthumous writings, with Dai's books on one side and Kong's books on the other). His books mainly discuss elementary learning and are highly valued at home and abroad and are the most valuable. The plates are well preserved. There is also Ruan Yuan's "Examination of Metal and Stone Illustrations" (Ruan was an educational inspector in Shandong during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty). Because Ruan and Kong were related by marriage, the plates are stored in Qufu (the plates are not in the Confucius Mansion but are known to be stored in the home of a Confucius clan member, and further investigation is needed). Kong Guanglin, whose courtesy name is Congbai, wrote "Kong's Explanation of Classics" (the plates are stored in the library). There are also three kinds of lyrics and songs, Kong Chuanzhi and Kong Chuanduo, the Duke Yansheng, wrote books such as music scores. In addition, there is "The History of Literature in Que Li," "Confucius Family Rituals" (recording the ancient wedding and funeral customs of the Confucius family in great detail), "A Broad Record of the Ancestral Court," etc. ("A Broad Record of the Ancestral Court" was originally a book recording the anecdotes of the temple court of the Confucius family, but it is now circulating in the market as "A Broad Record of the Temple Court"). Kong Guangsen, whose courtesy name is Zhixuan, was the younger brother of Kong Guanglin, and wrote ("The Writings of Zhixuan"), which includes "A General Explanation of Gongyang," "A Commentary on the Great Dai Ritual," and "The Yizhen Hall Collection," respecting Zheng Kangcheng and explaining the meaning of the classics. There are also "The Collection of Poetry Sounds and Examples of Poetry Sounds," etc. The above books are just a small part of the many books, which may be rarely circulated in the world or have never been printed, and are of great value for widespread circulation.</p>
<p>Reorganize the Confucius Sacrificial Fields in Qufu</p>
<p>The Confucius Mansion in Qufu originally had 4,000 qing of sacrificial fields. Over time, much of the land was in Nanyang Lake. In recent years, due to changes in rivers and lakes, some of the land has rolled into the lake. There is also a lot of land in Fengpei, Xiao, and Dang counties in Jiangsu Province, which is boundless and without boundary stones. Over time, it has been impossible to verify, and much of it has been encroached upon by others. Representatives of the Confucius Mansion stated to the representatives of the National Government and the Provincial Government the recent economic difficulties of the Confucius Mansion and asked for the reorganization of the sacrificial fields. Now, Han Fuju, the main administrator of the Provincial Government, has ordered Kong Decheng to submit a detailed register of the land for review and reorganization, and to revere the sacrificial rites.</p>
<p>Restoring the Confucius Temple Requires 500,000</p>
<p>The Provincial Government is currently sending personnel to survey and estimate the cost of repairing the Confucius Temple (and preparing construction funds. It is said that the renovation of the Dacheng Hall requires 100,000 yuan, the renovation of the two corridors requires 100,000 yuan, and the Kuiwen Pavilion also requires 60,000 yuan, totaling about 500,000 yuan. If the county government can raise more funds and carry out extensive renovations, making it more solid and magnificent, it would be a grand event.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Three County Police Teams Merged into a Battalion</p>
<p>The defense groups of Songjiang, Fengxian, and Qingpu counties are now ordered by the Provincial Security Department to be reorganized into the 12th Battalion of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Team.

Recently, he received a secret report that Wu Changyou, a key suspect in the case, was hiding in the Changtai area. He immediately dispatched officers and informants to secretly follow him for many days. Because Wu was strong and powerful, they did not dare to act rashly. On the morning of the day before yesterday, Wu was drinking tea at the Wanchun Garden Teahouse in the city. The officers reported to the County Public Security Bureau, requesting police assistance. The bureau dispatched many police officers to encircle and arrest him, nearly allowing him to escape. Fortunately, the police officers bravely stepped forward and captured him. He was immediately taken to the Public Security Bureau for detention. At the same time, he reported back to the team and prepared official documents to bring him back to justice. It is said that Wu is a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, and is nearly 50 years old.</p>

In the spring of this year, Tongzhao came to Suzhou from Ningbo and stayed at the Tianfu Nunnery, where he smoked red pills and opium. However, his actions were very secretive, and few outsiders knew about it. Someone reported it to the Second Public Security Bureau, which sent Inspector Cui and police officers to search the nunnery on the 27th.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Comply with the Urban Land Price Declaration</p>
<p>Qian Sunqing and Li Tipping, members of the County Land Price Declaration Assistance Committee, convened a discussion meeting yesterday at the County Chamber of Commerce for the purpose of promoting the declaration of urban land prices. Town chiefs and local figures from the urban area attended the meeting. The representatives spoke one after another and discussed for two hours before reaching a decision. Regarding the issue of land price declaration, it is a matter of legal decree and should be complied with. However, the collection of land price tax and land price appreciation tax should be postponed during this time of economic depression. Only when the economy actually turns around can we carefully consider ways to ease the burden on the people. As for the standard for declaring land prices, the town chiefs should first conduct a detailed investigation of the actual situation in all aspects, and then discuss and determine it at another meeting on the fifth of next month.</p>

At the same time, Tan Genquan filed a complaint with Zhang Hanwei, the police inspector of the Department of Civil Affairs.

<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>Traitorous Merchants Smuggling Grain for Export Blocked</p>
<p>Li Youxiang, the owner of the Yishengchang firm in Lingdian Port, the Fourth District, has been buying at low prices and smuggling grain for export every year during the new wheat harvest, in order to make huge profits. This autumn, the miscellaneous grains harvest was poor, and there was a famine. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Li sold more than 7,000 shi of stored yuan wheat, wheat, and broad beans to grain merchants in Shandong, intending to smuggle them out yesterday. However, he was discovered by nearby villagers, who gathered more than a hundred people and went to stop him. The crowd was furious, and the situation was serious. Yuan Liuqing, the district chief of the district, sent personnel to persuade them and ordered the firm not to smuggle the grain out. A disturbance was thus quelled.</p>
<p>Families of Victims Request Detention of Baohua Steamer</p>
<p>Liu Qigui, a villager from Xindongli, the eastern part of Beixin Town, Qidong, 31 years old, worked as a tea server at the Catholic Church in Xujiahui, Shanghai.

When the ship reached Sanhe Port, it ran aground and was in danger. Qigui drowned in the river. Afterwards, Caiqi reported to Qigui's wife, Liu Zhangshi, who hired someone to search for the body but was unsuccessful. The clothes, cash, foreign ornaments, and other items carried by Qigui were worth about 200 yuan and were also lost. Liu Zhangshi yesterday specially entrusted lawyer Huang Menggang to petition the county government to detain the ship for investigation, and attached a private lawsuit, requesting that the company be ordered to compensate for the loss and pay a pension of 9,100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>

<p>Letter from Lawyer Shen Qi</p>
<p>Dear Sir, According to Dai Hanyun, I'm writing to you regarding a piece of news from Chuansha published in the Shenbao on the 20th of this month. The news stated that Huang Dechang and other farmer representatives from Hengsha County filed a criminal lawsuit with the Chuansha County Government against the Nanjingsha Affairs Bureau and the Education Public Group, accusing them of extracting rent director Dai Hanyun's name and exploiting the people for their own selfish gain, neglecting their duties, and causing a great disaster last year. Dai Hanyun passed the responsibility onto his superiors, claiming that although the difference fee had been ordered to stop being collected in the 18th year, the Nanjingsha School still ordered it to be collected. All the money collected over the years was turned over, 40% was used to repair the embankment, and the tenants were responsible, which was not a personal decision. The Nanjingsha School Board and the Education Public Group officials all had far reaching means, but the Chuansha County Government actually ruled the criminal charges as not guilty and ordered a separate civil lawsuit to be filed. The representatives were not satisfied with the ruling and filed an appeal, etc. This is not in accordance with the facts. When Huang Dechang sued Hanyun, he filed the lawsuit as a plaintiff and did not state that he was a representative of such-and-such. The difference fee was not ordered to stop being collected. All the fees collected by Hanyun during his tenure were reported, and there are register books to prove it. Even last year, the Sixth District Office sent a letter requesting that the difference fee be allocated to epidemic prevention expenses, and the payment was made after reporting to the Nanpu School Board and receiving approval. There are also correspondence documents that can be checked. Last year, the cost of raising the Shunli embankment was to be shared by the Nanjingsha School and the tenants, but because the tenants did not agree, Hanyun notified accountant Yuan Baiyan to wait for the merchants and tenants to discuss the matter before distributing the money. There is also the original letter to prove it. Hanyun has been in Sha for five years and only knows to be dutiful and abide by the law, disregarding personal interests. There is no need for the Nanjingsha School and the Education Public Group to use means in order to protect him. Now, the case has been ruled by the Shanghai District Court, which rejected the appeal of Huang Dechang and others. The truth will be revealed. However, the news falsely accuses Hanyun of extracting rent director's name and exploiting the people for their own selfish gain and neglecting their duties, and that the Nanjingsha School Board and the Education Public Group officials had far reaching means, which is related to the reputation of Hanyun and others. Please represent us and send a letter requesting a correction from your newspaper. Sincerely, Lawyer Shen Qi, 23.9.28</p>

<p>Those present yesterday included more than two hundred representatives from the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of the Navy, and various provincial branches. The chairmen, Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Peiyuan, and Lin Kanghou, reported on the minutes of the fourth meeting.

The following fifteen individuals were elected as directors. Huang Hanzhi, Yao Yuqin, Gu Zhuxuan, Li Yingnan, Zhang Xiantai, Qian Xinzhi, and Zhu Yinjiang were elected as alternate directors.</p>
<p>Convention Declaration</p>
<p>The instability of the world situation has never been greater than it is today. Looking back sixteen years to the European War, it ended with the world's expectation of peace. The League of Nations was born from the world's expectation of peace. All the countries that directly participated in the war have their own regrets. Those who were indirectly affected by the war without participating in it also realized that the war was too inhumane. Therefore, the discussion of stopping wars and reducing troops also arose. For a time, the atmosphere of peace permeated the world. This can truly be called the good fortune of mankind and the gospel of the world. However, not long after, new conflicts of interest gradually emerged between countries, creating an unstable situation. Although countries still outwardly promoted the movement for peace, they secretly expanded their military preparations. Consequently, some observers of the situation suddenly published a prediction that a second world war would occur in 1936. Those who had hoped for peace became discouraged, and then the September 18th Incident in Northeast China suddenly occurred, shocking the world and leading people to believe that it was a sign of the Second World War. Countries then began to prepare for war, revealing their false masks of peace and intensifying their competition to expand their military armaments. In this case, even if the Second World War does not occur in 1936, it will ultimately only be a matter of time. Our country, as a weak nation, is caught in the middle. If we unfortunately encounter this change, how can we cope? Can we bear to sit idly by while our regions are devastated and our soldiers and civilians are killed and injured without thinking of how to rescue them? At this time, the only thing that can preserve our country's position in the international community is our Red Cross Society. Our country's Red Cross Society was founded in the 30th year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty. In the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign, it formed an alliance with the International Red Cross Society and was included in the international community, obtaining recognition from the allied countries. Since then, it has experienced the domestic revolutionary wars and the civil wars in various provinces, and has provided relief to the natural disasters in countries such as Japan, the United States, and Russia. It has also responded to incidents such as the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident. For thirty years, the general and branch societies have been almost constantly prepared to rescue and protect civilian casualties. In times of peace, it has also been constantly engaged in disaster relief, epidemic prevention, and assisting neighboring countries with their disasters. What cannot be avoided is that the Red Cross Society is a new undertaking in our country, and people's understanding is still not genuine. Therefore, there are not many members, and resources are weak. All kinds of undertakings are ultimately unavoidable to be beyond our capabilities. This can be barely coped with in ordinary times. However, at a time when the atmosphere of the Second World War is pervasive, if we continue to make do with what we have without thinking of how to improve, if we encounter a major change that is even more severe than the European War, the areas of North China and the Southeast coast may fall into an indescribable state, and even the major commercial ports of the country may be difficult to protect. With such a small scale and incomplete equipment of the Red Cross Society, how can it fulfill its heavenly duty of universal love, compassion for soldiers, and rescuing those in distress? This is in terms of responding to the changes of the times. From the perspective of the association itself, the association was established at the end of the late Qing Dynasty. All organizations have been following the same system for thirty years. Times have changed, and it is urgent to make changes in order to meet the needs of the times. All of this is the reason for convening this national member representative convention. This convention was held on September 24, the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and closed on September 28. In addition to the representatives of the general association members, there were more than one hundred branches in various provinces with more than two hundred representatives. The proposals made were also able to meet the needs and were able to express the spirit of striving for improvement. From now on, the association will have a new look and open a new era. This is a congratulation to the future of the association. To summarize the important cases decided by this convention, the outline is recorded as follows: (1) In accordance with the Regulations for the Management of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China promulgated by the National Government and the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Regulations for the Management of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the bylaws of the general and branch associations of the association shall be amended to ensure that the organization is complete and to improve the efficiency of handling affairs. (2) Reduce membership dues, recruit more youth members, establish a women's department, and train rescue and nursing personnel, and pre-store rescue materials, so that the internal affairs can be enriched at ordinary times, and it can be responded to with ease in the event of a change. (3) Establish well-equipped hospitals in the capital and various ports, and set up disaster relief and relief agencies, so that it can treat the diseases of civilians and save the suffering of the poor at ordinary times, and can treat Chinese and foreign wounded soldiers in the event of a change, so as to respect humanity, so as not to temporarily establish new ones and the effectiveness is insufficient. The above is just a brief overview of the major ones. There are many other cases decided, which cannot be listed one by one. Here, a solemn announcement is made to the members of the general and branch associations that the cases decided this time must be implemented, so that the organization of the general and branch associations themselves is sound, and the response to peacetime and wartime will be effective. It must be known that the period of international peace is far away. No matter what our country's attitude is at that time, its position will be extremely dangerous. All members of our Red Cross have no power to reverse this disaster, but only have the great wish to work hard and serve the association, with the idea of loving and saving people, in order to win the sympathy of the people of the country and the international community. In peacetime, they should also work hard to help the poor and relieve disasters, directly creating welfare for the society and indirectly creating welfare for themselves. Now, in order to arouse the common attention of the comrades of the association and the people of the whole country, this declaration is made.</p>
<h3>Request to the Central Government for Investigation of Responsibility for the Breach at Changyuan</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the issue of responsibility for the Yellow River breach at Changyuan, a reporter inquired with the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee yesterday. In addition to the director of the River Affairs Bureau, Sun Qingze, being ordered by the government to be dismissed from his position by the Hebei Provincial Government for investigation, other matters will be submitted to the Central Committee for review. As for the content of the measures, it is currently not permitted to be published.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Talks About Unified Water Conservancy</h3>
<p>Establish a National Water Conservancy Commission</p>
<p>Appoint Kong Xiangxi as Chairman, with an annual budget of six million</p>
<p>Kong Xiangrong, Li Yizhi, and others as Standing Committee Members</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council, entered Beijing on the 25th to attend the standing committee meeting of the National Economic Council. He completed his official duties and took a special express train from Beijing to Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the 27th, arriving in Shanghai at 11:30 PM. On the morning of the 28th, he met with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Avenue Road and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Unified Water Conservancy</p>
<p>Mr. Song first mentioned that the most important resolution of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, which was convened in Beijing this time, was the unified national water conservancy plan. It was decided to establish a National Water Conservancy Commission under the National Economic Council. The chairman will be Minister Kong, and two other standing committee members will be appointed. One of the candidates is Kong Xiangrong, director of the labor relief group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, and the other is Li Yizhi, chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. As for the unified water conservancy plan, it will be carried out according to the decision of the Central Political Conference, so that national water conservancy can be unified. The budget will be 500,000 yuan per month from the Ministry of Finance, with an annual budget of 6 million yuan. After the establishment of the Water Conservancy Commission, it will become an affiliated agency of the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>Wei River Loan</p>
<p>As for the Wei River loan, Yang Hucheng, director of pacification in Shaanxi, came to Shanghai last month to negotiate with the banking community and agreed to borrow 1.55 million yuan. The detailed procedures have been agreed upon, and Mr. Yang will send someone to Shanghai to sign the loan contract. The collateral for the loan is (1) the water field tax (referring to the water field tax on both sides of the Wei, Jing, and Luo canals) and (2) the provincial business tax revenue. Mr. Song believes that this loan and repayment method is appropriate, because borrowing for construction means repaying the loan from the income of the constructed project, which is indeed a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Next Year's Funding</p>
<p>Most of the funding for the National Economic Council next year has not yet been secured, so this time, the Standing Committee decided to assign Minister Kong and himself to be responsible for planning. He and others will immediately start planning according to this decision, so that the work of the National Economic Council will not be slightly frustrated due to lack of economic resources.</p>
<p>Technical Cooperation</p>
<p>The technical cooperation between the National Economic Council and the League of Nations is still actively continuing. Dr. Raciman, the technical liaison officer previously sent to China by the League of Nations, has completed his term and returned to Geneva. Therefore, the League of Nations has now decided to send Dr. Robeit Haas to continue to serve in this position. Mr. Haas is the Minister of Transportation of the League of Nations, and was the Secretary-General of the Lytton Investigation Team organized by the League of Nations. When Dr. Raciman had not yet arrived in China, the League of Nations had decided to send Mr. Haas to China. Later, Mr. Haas served as the Secretary-General of the Lytton Investigation Team, so Raciman was sent instead. Now that Mr. Ra's term has expired, Mr. Haas has been sent to China, and is expected to arrive in China within one or two months. Several water conservancy experts will also come to China with Mr. Haas. As for Mr. Haas's salary, it will be borne by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Improved Silk</p>
<p>Dr. Mari, a silk expert specially sent to China by the League of Nations, completed his term in January of this year, so he was reappointed for another year. Since arriving in China, Mr. Ma has visited Sichuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other provinces to investigate the silk situation. Now he has researched the method of combining Jiangsu and Zhejiang silkworm species with Italian silkworm species in Hangzhou. After obtaining considerable results, it is decided to first test it in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and then promote it to the silkworm breeding provinces across the country.</p>
<p>Answers to Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>Mr. Song finally answered questions from various reporters: (1) Regarding the inaccurate rumors of US Senator Nye, he only saw it in the newspaper. (2) The Fifth National Congress decided to be held as scheduled, and he decided to go to Beijing to attend, but there were no proposals. (3) The rumor that Dr. Yan Huiqing, the ambassador to the Soviet Union, has requested to resign due to his old age and physical weakness has also only been seen in newspapers. (4) It is rumored that the Central Committee will send Central Committee members Huang Shaoxiong and Zhang Puquan to Hong Kong and Guangdong to consult with the Central Committee members in Guangdong about the Fifth National Congress. It was not mentioned in Beijing, and it is feared that it is not confirmed.</p>
<h3>Elevation of Chinese and Italian Envoys Liu and Baoli Express Pleasure</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Hosted Liu Wendao and His Wife Last Night</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and Germany Will Also Follow Suit in Exchanging Ambassadors</p>
<p>The elevation of the envoys of China and Italy has been formally announced by the governments of both countries. Liu Wendao, the Chinese envoy to Italy, and Bascari, the Italian envoy, also made statements yesterday afternoon, expressing their sincere hope for the increase in diplomatic relations between China and Italy. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process According to reliable sources yesterday, both countries are very pleased with the exchange of ambassadors between China and Italy. The negotiation process for this matter has been going on for a long time. At that time, our country was conducting negotiations with countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Japan at the same time. However, each country shirked responsibility. Only the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, through the efforts of the former Italian envoy to China, Qi Yanuojue, and various important figures in our country's diplomatic circles, finally succeeded in exchanging documents on the 26th of this month. All other related countries were greatly surprised when they heard about it. According to comments from relevant diplomatic figures, Italy's move further demonstrates Mussolini's decisive spirit of acting independently. It is expected that Germany and the United Kingdom will follow Italy's lead and exchange ambassadors with China. Germany has no special rights and interests in China, and British diplomacy has always been smooth, so it should not lag behind again in this move.</p>
<p>Ambassadorial Candidates It is internally decided that the first Chinese ambassador to Italy will be Liu Wendao, the current Chinese envoy to Italy. It is also internally decided that the first Italian ambassador to China will be Bascari, the current Italian envoy to China. Envoy Liu is scheduled to attend the Fifth National Congress and then take the letter of credence to Italy to formally meet with the Italian Emperor and present it. The Italian envoy will wait for the formal appointment and the letter of credence to be sent to Shanghai before going to Beijing to meet with Chairman Lin and present the letter of credence.</p>
<p>Envoy Liu Expresses According to what Liu Wendao told visiting reporters yesterday, China is the birthplace of Eastern civilization, while Italy is the birthplace of European civilization. The elevation of the envoys of China and Italy to ambassadors will make a great contribution to the increase of diplomatic relations between China and Italy, the communication of Eastern and Western cultures, and the protection of world peace. He feels very happy about this. According to international practice, the status of an ambassador is much higher than that of an envoy. The ambassador can visit the foreign minister of the host country at any time, and can meet with the head of state once every three days when necessary. He can also invite the head of state of the host country to participate in various social interactions at any time. All of these can be used to increase the diplomatic relations between the two countries and provide great convenience and benefit in diplomacy.</p>
<p>Italian Envoy Speaks Italian Envoy Bascari said that the event of the elevation of the envoys of China and Italy has now been officially confirmed. He has very good feelings about the implementation of the elevation of the envoys of China and Italy. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has always regarded the communication between Europe and Asia as his own responsibility. You should remember the speech given by the Italian Prime Minister at the Asian Student Conference held in Rome in December last year. This time, the implementation of the elevation of the envoys of China and Italy will be of great benefit to the diplomatic relations between China and Italy. In the future, the economic, political, and cultural relations between China and Italy will definitely become closer. As for whether the Italian embassy in China will be moved to Beijing in the future, or will remain in Shanghai, he cannot tell, because the candidate for the Italian ambassador to China has not yet been announced. Embassy Address However, according to reliable information from diplomatic circles, the Italian embassy in China will currently be located at the old site of the Italian envoy to China on Jing'an Temple Road. In the future, it will be moved to Nanjing, but the issue of moving to Beijing cannot be realized in the short term.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Hosts Liu Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and his wife specially hosted Liu Wendao, the Chinese envoy to Italy, and his wife at their residence on West Avenue Road at 7:00 PM last night to celebrate the success of the elevation of the envoys of China and Italy. Song Ziwen, Wu Tiecheng, and other important figures were also invited to accompany them. The party ended happily at about 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3>The City General Labor Union Decides to Prepare for National Day Celebrations</h3>
<p>The labor union has difficulties in collecting fees</p>
<p>Request the Party and government to issue a notice</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the City General Labor Union held a full executive committee meeting at the union headquarters on Fuyou Road at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon.

After performing the rituals, he reported on one matter (omitted). Discussion items: (1) The Tea Workers Union presented a case where the foreman of Chunhe Tea Shop used the newspaper's misrepresentation of Chairman Jiang's order to refuse to pay union dues. After sending someone to negotiate, he still could not be understood. It was decided: (A) Request the party and government organs to issue a notice regarding the previous misrepresentation of Chairman Jiang's order in the newspaper, so as to avoid misunderstandings among various factories and workers and to facilitate the labor union's collection of fees. (B) Regarding the Chunhe Tea Shop incident, it will also be submitted to the City Party Department for review. (2) A letter from the Garrison Headquarters regarding the scheduled burning of opium, requesting the dispatch of representatives to monitor the scene. It was decided to send committee member Li Mengnan to attend. (3) The workers of the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory presented a case where the factory unfairly dismissed them and requested assistance.

<p>Blind Flight Pilot Arrived in Shanghai at the Same Time</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, in order to resume the Shanghai-Guangdong line, China Aviation Corporation ordered two Douglas giant new aircraft from the United States. They were loaded on the Swedish ship Max, managed by the American Fashion Company, and arrived at the Yangshupu China Merchants Wharf at 9:00 PM last night. The two new aircraft were disassembled and packed into more than fifty boxes. As it was late when they arrived, the company did not have time to inspect them.

It will take about a week to assemble one aircraft. By the beginning of next month, all of them can be fully assembled. Silas, the pilot who was previously sent to the United States to practice blind flight, also arrived in Shanghai on the Max ship. After the new aircraft are assembled, Mr. Silas will pilot the test flight. It is expected that the Shanghai-Guangdong route will be officially resumed in the middle of next month.

<h3>Another Korean Party Member Arrested</h3>
<p>Japanese Police Collaborated with French Police to Arrest Him</p>
<p>According to the Great American Evening News, last Saturday and Sunday, another Korean youth, Zhang Yuanshou (transliteration), was arrested by four police officers from the Japanese Consulate and a Chinese detective from the French Concession at his residence in Xiafei Village, 300 Hualong Road, and taken to the Japanese Consulate. Mr. Zhang is probably a member of the Korean People's Party. He has a wife and two children. When he was arrested, his wife and children were not at home. Only after returning did they learn about it from the people in the alley. Mr. Zhang's wife, because of her helplessness, went to the Japanese Consulate every day to visit him, but she was always rejected. She was told that Mr. Zhang had committed a serious crime and was awaiting trial, and no one was allowed to see him. According to Mr. Zhang's wife, her husband did not commit any crimes, but he usually opposed the Japanese. All patriotic Koreans are like this. How can he be accused of unwarranted crimes? This morning (the 28th), a police officer from the Japanese Consulate confirmed Mr. Zhang's arrest, and said that it is common for Koreans in the French Concession to be arrested for engaging in anti-Japanese activities. However, Mr. Zhang's arrest was not due to anti-Japanese political activities, but because of trafficking and manufacturing morphine, and committing murder several years ago.</p>

<h3>The China Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau Ceases Operation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Preparatory Office has been dismantled.</p>
<p>Central Government to establish a separate entity.</p>
<p>The China Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, championed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, had established a preparatory office in Shanghai and was actively progressing. It is now understood that the Bureau's preparations have ceased. The Central Government will instead organize a National Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau. All previously collected provincial share capital will be returned in full to the respective provinces and cities. It is understood that the capital amount has been decided to increase to four million yuan, which will be initially borrowed from the Central Bank. The detailed circumstances before and after are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Batch of Telegrams</p>
<p>(1) A telegram from Gu Xin-yi, Director of the Preparatory Office of the China Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated: "The Provisional Meeting of the Executive Yuan has resolved to establish a Grain Bureau under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance as soon as possible." Therefore, the preparatory work of this office should cease immediately. The share capital previously collected from the provinces should also be returned in full to clear procedures. (2) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the Executive Yuan, stating: "Since the establishment of the Preparatory Office of the China Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, repeated telegrams have urged provincial and municipal governments to submit their share capital on file. Now that the Executive Yuan has resolved that the government should establish and manage the Bureau under the Ministry of Finance, the Director and others have requested to cease preparatory work, in accordance with the division of authority, and to return the share capital already paid by the provinces and cities in order to conclude matters. This should be approved. In addition to instructing compliance, please expedite the establishment of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau by the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<p>Reasons for Reorganization</p>
<p>The motivation for establishing the China Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau stemmed from the representatives of eight provinces seeking to alleviate rural distress and develop the grain business. In November of last year, a preparatory office was established in Shanghai, with Preparatory Director Gu Xin-yi responsible for its progress. The share capital was determined to be two million yuan, to be borne equally by official and commercial parties, with the aim of collecting shares before January of this year. However, until last month, grain merchants from various provinces had not yet fully paid, causing delays in its establishment. During the provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan the previous month, it was also noted that the drought in various regions was severe, necessitating the urgent establishment of a Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau to provide relief and stabilize market prices. It was resolved to dismantle the already-in-preparation China Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau and instruct the Ministry of Finance to establish a separate entity to expedite its realization.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Takes Charge</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi also believed that, in the face of rural bankruptcy, the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau was indeed necessary to be expanded to provide relief. The previous Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau's official capital of only one million yuan was insufficient for the task. Now that it has been reorganized to be established by the government, it is proposed to increase the capital to four million yuan, and at the same time expand the organization, establishing grain transportation and sales bureau branches in various regions, and establishing new-style rural warehouses universally. In years of abundant harvests, when there is overproduction, the grain can be purchased and stored in warehouses, preventing low grain prices from harming farmers. If there is a drought like this year, with poor harvests for farming families, the warehouses can release surplus rice to regulate the market. This would stabilize market prices and prevent unscrupulous merchants from monopolizing the market again.</p>
<p>Urgent Establishment</p>
<p>In order to expedite its establishment, Kong Xiangxi has instructed the recently established preparatory office in Beijing to intensify its work and actively proceed. According to a report by the China Eastern News Agency reporter yesterday, preparatory matters have largely been completed, and personnel have been dispatched to Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui to investigate the actual situation. In order to prevent disasters in various regions, special commissioners have been separately dispatched to important rice-producing areas such as Hankou and Changsha to oversee the construction of storage warehouses. The internal organization and staff of the Bureau have also been internally determined, and all expenses have been approved. Once established, the Central Bank will initially provide loans.</p>
<h3>Cases of Violating Stamp Tax Laws to be Handled by Judicial Organs</h3>
<p>Order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to all Courts to comply.</p>
<p>To be implemented starting November 1st.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration has decreed that, starting from November 1st, cases of violating stamp tax laws will be handled by judicial organs. Special orders have been given to the High Courts of all provinces to comply. The original text is recorded as follows: "As approved by the Ministry of Finance, cases of violating stamp tax laws, except for the Shanghai Concession area which is handled by the Shanghai Special District Court, the remaining inland areas are handled by the stamp tax branch bureaus. However, the penalties imposed by these branch bureaus are often inappropriate, resulting in innocent merchants being unfairly penalized. Although the review is more fair in places where committees for reviewing cases of violating stamp tax regulations have been established, due to the different situations in each location, they cannot be universally established, which has a significant impact on the future of tax administration. In order to thoroughly reform stamp tax matters in accordance with the resolutions of the current financial conference, this Ministry has ordered all provincial stamp tax collection agencies to uniformly close down by the end of October of this year. New stamp tax stamps with a pagoda design, manufactured by this Ministry, have been agreed upon with the Ministry of Communications, and starting from November 1st, they will be entrusted to post offices in all provinces to sell on commission. The inspection of stamp tax matters will be the responsibility of the provincial, municipal, and county governments, with personnel dispatched by the provincial stamp tax and alcohol bureaus to conduct random checks at any time, and personnel dispatched by this Ministry to supervise progress. Hereafter, cases of violating stamp tax regulations that are discovered must not be unilaterally penalized by inspection agencies in order to eliminate longstanding malpractices. It is proposed to follow the precedent of the Shanghai Special District Court handling cases of violating stamp tax, and uniformly submit them to the judicial organs in various regions for handling. The judicial organs of your esteemed offices should be instructed to instruct the subordinate courts and county governments concurrently handling judicial affairs to comply. Starting from November 1st of this year, cases of violating stamp tax regulations submitted for trial by various cities and counties should be handled in accordance with the revised Rules for Judicial Organs to Impose Penalties and Execute the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations. In addition to submitting reports and issuing separate orders for announcements, a corresponding notification should be made for examination and implementation. This order is issued for compliance and for informing subordinates to comply."</p>
<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Investigate Existing Stamp Tax Quantities</h3>
<p>Deadline for summarized reports by October 10th</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified the trade associations of all industries, stating: "Respectfully, we have repeatedly received reports from various trade associations that the Ministry of Finance has set November 1st as the date to implement new stamp tax stamps, but there are no explicit provisions for exchanging the existing unexpired tax stamps, and they have requested assistance. This Chamber has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance three times, earnestly requesting that it allow old stamps to be exchanged for new, but we have not yet received a reply. The number of letters requesting assistance from various industries due to this matter has reached several each day. The Fresh Pork Industry Trade Association has also proposed to send letters to various industries in advance to investigate the accumulated stamp inventory. This matter was submitted to the 13th Standing Committee meeting, which resolved to first send letters to various industries to investigate the number of existing stamp tax stamps, categorized by type and quantity, and to schedule an Executive Committee meeting to discuss solutions. This is a hurried notification. It is hoped that your association will summarize the number of stamp tax stamps stored by your industry members, categorized by type and quantity, and report it to this Chamber before October 10th for verification."</p>

<h3>Ya Tax in Zhabei, Wusong, and Other Districts Consolidated under Municipal Management</h3>
<p>All taxes must be paid and verified by today</p>
<p>Since the Zhabei, Wusong, Jiangwan, and Yinhang districts, formerly under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County, were placed under the administration of Shanghai Municipality, the ya tax certificates for businesses in these districts have continued to be issued by Baoshan County. In order to standardize the ya certificates in Shanghai Municipality, they have been consolidated under the management of the Municipal Finance Bureau. Therefore, businesses in these districts with old ya certificates must submit them to the Zhabei Inspection Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau at the intersection of Zhabei and Xinjiang Roads by the end of this month for verification. As the 30th of this month is a Sunday, today (the 29th) is the last day. Businesses that fail to submit their certificates for verification by the deadline will have their old ya certificates invalidated. Therefore, businesses in these districts holding ya certificates issued by Baoshan County must take note.</p>

Recently, Yuqing fell ill and was bedridden. Ms. Zhao sought medical treatment for him. Yesterday, around 3 p.m., Zhao Wangshi was holding a prescription, heading to the pharmacy to fill it, crossing the railroad tracks. Unexpectedly, a train sped by.

<h3>Record of the Completion Ceremony of the China &amp; South Sea Bank Building</h3>
<p>More than 3,000 Chinese and foreign guests came to congratulate</p>
<p>Total daily business volume exceeded 4 million yuan</p>
<p>The China &amp; South Sea Bank on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession has been established for six years, and its business has greatly developed. The original building was therefore insufficient to meet its needs, so it invested 2 million yuan to purchase land and construct a state-of-the-art fifteen-story building. The construction took three years, with renowned Chinese and French engineers planning and building it, finally completing it. The interior is perfectly equipped, and the layout is innovative. The building was fully completed yesterday, and a grand opening ceremony was held. For a time, Chinese and foreign guests came to congratulate and deposit money, and the streets were crowded with carriages and horses. The French police specially dispatched many Chinese and foreign police and detectives to maintain order. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Construction</p>
<p>The bank building is located in the bustling commercial district of the French Concession, reaching fifteen stories in height, and faces the road on all sides. The lower four floors on the north side are used by the bank itself, the lower two floors on the south side are shop fronts, and the nine floors above are rented out as office spaces, totaling more than one hundred rooms. Floors ten through twelve are Western-style apartments. The thirteenth floor is a staff recreation area, and the upper two floors are water towers and flagpoles. The entire building adopts the latest three-dimensional style, which is magnificent and luxurious. The bank area is particularly grand. The interior is decorated with marble. The vault is equipped with a circular vault door, and the keys are the latest style. There are six inspection rooms inside the vault for convenience. In addition to the ground floor, there is also a huge vault in the basement for rental. The office area is equipped with three elevators, and each floor has a large public reception room. The apartment area has three to five bedrooms per unit, with bathrooms, kitchens, food preparation rooms, servant rooms, and gas, electricity, water tanks, and other equipment. All projects are undertaken by famous experts, so they are highly praised by architects.</p>
<p>Grand Opening</p>
<p>The bank officially opened at 8:00 a.m. Chairman Du Yuesheng used a golden key to unlock the door, which suddenly opened, and led all the directors, supervisors, managers, and staff to enter.

<h3>Longhua Temple's Property Records Are All Recorded in Perpetual Account Books</h3>
<p>The Perpetual Account Books Have Not Yet Been Handed Over</p>
<p>A Large-Scale Theft and Sale of Land Has Been Discovered</p>
<p>The former abbot of Longhua Temple, Yuan Zhao, was recently accused by Longhua Temple's mountain owner, Lu Mingzhao, and the current abbot, Xingkong, of stealing and selling temple property, requesting a thorough investigation. An order was given to detain Yuan Zhao and confiscate a small leather suitcase containing various deeds, which were transferred to the local court. Prosecutor Wu Deying questioned and detained Yuan Zhao, and summoned witnesses for questioning. These details have been previously reported. It is now understood that the court is being exceptionally cautious about this case, so it has sent a letter to the municipal party headquarters for a detailed investigation. According to records, the temple has two perpetual account books, on which all the temple's business properties, revenue-generating instruments, and solemn items are clearly recorded. One is stored at the mountain owner Lu Mingzhao's place, and the other is kept in the temple. There has been no change for a long time. Yuan Zhao took one of the perpetual account books with him when he left the temple in October of last year. He claimed to have handed it over to Zhao Yunshao, a standing committee member of the Buddhist Association, but it has not yet been handed over to the case. It has now been found that more than 30 mu of land in Xiaomuqiao area of Longhua belongs to Chengen Hall, Longhua Temple. More than 20 mu of land in Jinshan Zhujing and other places, and more than 30 mu of tidelands and reed marshes along Pujiang Beach in Longhua (the above-mentioned land is worth more than 100,000 yuan) have been almost entirely stolen and sold by Yuan Zhao. Other rare ancient bronze Buddhas and characters have also been missing in large quantities and are currently impossible to trace. Therefore, the court has been conducting thorough investigations in all directions in recent days in order to determine the facts.</p>
<h3>The Shun'an Ship Owners Request the Customs to Move the Ship to Shanghai for Handling</h3>
<p>The Shun'an ship is still detained at the Sandu'ao Customs. The goods on board cannot be unloaded at Quanzhou and Xinghua either. The passenger families who loaded the goods are questioning Zheng Zhongwu, the general director of the company, due to market and responsibility relations. Zheng believes that some of the passenger goods are insured. Now that there is a report of a thousand tons of undeclared goods, the truth needs to be thoroughly investigated. In reality, it is difficult to transfer the passengers and goods first. Therefore, he has submitted a request to the Customs Administration asking if it can order the Sandu'ao Customs to release the detained Shun'an ship and order it to return to Shanghai so that this case can be transferred to Shanghai for handling.</p>
<h3>Wu Tingsheng Returns to Shanghai to Talk About the General Situation of Xuchang Tobacco Leaves</h3>
<p>The Color and Taste of the Tobacco are Excellent</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee has been striving to improve domestic products to meet the needs of society. Its first step is to improve Xuchang tobacco leaves. The methods are divided into five steps: (1) improving tobacco varieties, (2) improving planting methods, (3) improving fertilizers, (4) improving curing methods, and (5) improving packaging. The most important of these is to improve tobacco varieties and control their production to avoid surpluses. Since this plan was formulated, Executive Committee member Wu Tingsheng has been sent to Xuchang to inspect the lives of tobacco farmers to provide research for the committee's improvement efforts. The committee also plans to purchase 100 acres of land as a test field for improving American tobacco varieties. The field will also prepare seeds and distribute them to tobacco farmers free of charge, while prohibiting tobacco farmers from storing inferior seeds. When the time for new leaves to come on the market arrived, the committee again sent Wu to inspect this year's harvest and guide tobacco farmers in adopting scientific curing methods. Wu returned to Shanghai a few days ago. According to him, this year's tobacco leaf yield was originally very rich, but a few villages suffered slight reductions in yields due to floods. However, the results in most areas are very good. In particular, after tobacco farmers adopted scientific curing methods, the color and taste of the tobacco are better than in previous years. He gained a lot of experience on this trip and is now busy drafting reports to report to the committee.</p>
<h3>Extravagance and Keeping a Mistress Lead to a Tragic End for a Young Man</h3>
<p>Li Runhua Commits Suicide by Poison</p>
<p>Li Runhua, a Yunnan native, was 39 years old and lived at No. 5 Dade Lane, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road. He used to work at the racecourse and had a considerable monthly income. In addition to his wife, he also kept a mistress. He was extravagant and spent money without restraint. Unexpectedly, he was soon fired, which led to a complete cutoff of income. However, Li still did not care and idled away his days as before. Soon, he was heavily in debt and unable to make up for it. Recalling the past, he was filled with resentment and committed suicide by swallowing poison in secret at dawn yesterday morning. By the time his family noticed, he was already unconscious. They rushed to report to the Xinza Police Station, which dispatched an ambulance to take him to the hospital for treatment. However, he was too deeply poisoned and could not be saved. He died in the hospital at around 10 a.m. The hospital reported the death to the police station, which transferred the body to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>The Result of Gambling Addiction</h3>
<p>Yang Zuoqi Dies Tragically from Poisoning</p>
<p>Yang Zuoqi, an Anhui native, was 26 years old and lived in a bungalow at No. 5 Jingzhou Road, Hudong. He worked as a mason. He was addicted to gambling and had accumulated a large amount of debt that he could not repay. As a result, he became resentful and despondent yesterday and secretly swallowed opium to kill himself. His father, Yang Haiyun, discovered this and sent him to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and he soon died. The hospital reported the death to the Yangshupu Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the Fielun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. According to Yang Haiyun's statement, he was 45 years old and the deceased was his son. He usually gambled outside, and I repeatedly advised him, but to no avail. Yesterday morning at around 8 a.m., I saw him lying in bed crying and his face turned pale. I asked him what was wrong and learned that he had taken poison because he owed money from gambling and could not repay it. Guo obtained the statement and determined that the deceased, Yang Zuoqi, male, had died from opium poisoning. The body was handed over to his father, Yang Haiyun, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>Huahui Offender Lin Shaoquan Escapes, the Guarantor is Discovered to Have Used a Substitute</h3>
<p>The Substitute is Sentenced to Six Months in Prison</p>
<p>The Original Guarantor is Also Prosecuted</p>
<p>Lin Shaoquan was arrested by the French police for gambling in Huahui in the French Concession and sent to the Second Special Court for questioning. He was sentenced to one month in prison and a fine of 100 yuan. During the appeal period, he was allowed to be released on bail with a guarantor who could be summoned at any time. He then asked Zhang Shigen, a Lu'an native who ran the Hongyi Rice Shop opened by Father Lao, to sign and stamp a guarantee. However, the name of the person in charge of Hongyi Rice Shop on the guarantee was not Zhang Shigen, but Zhang Songlin. Unexpectedly, Lin absconded after being released on bail. When the case was confirmed, Zhang Songlin, the guarantor, was summoned to hand over the person within a certain period, but Zhang could not hand over the person and asked Chen Shaolang to go to court to impersonate Zhang Songlin in order to be executed in his place. However, the judge found out that Chen Shaolang was not Zhang Songlin and was impersonating him. He was immediately detained and Chen was transferred to the prosecutor's office for investigation. After the prosecution, the criminal court sentenced Chen to six months in prison. Now, the Second Special Court sent Zhang Songlin to the prosecutor's office for investigation for the crime of facilitating escape. He was allowed to be released on bail pending further instructions. Meanwhile, he was prosecuted in the criminal court. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozuo opened the fifth criminal court to summon Zhang Songlin, also known as Zhang Shigen. Because Zhang had returned to Anhui for business, his lawyer, Hu Quan, appeared in court as his representative and requested a postponement. The court approved the request and ordered that the hearing be rescheduled until the defendant arrived in court.</p>
<h3>Prostitute Accuses Customer of Abandonment After Pregnancy</h3>
<p>Visitors to Pleasure Quarters Should be Vigilant</p>
<p>The Case is Dismissed</p>
<p>Chuan Liangzhen, a middle-aged woman of 34, used to work in a brothel. Around January of this year, she was still in a room in a brothel in Leyuli, Yunnan Road. After the Dragon Boat Festival, she moved to Shantou Road to run her own business, changing her stage name from Zhen Luolan to Hongniang, acting as both madam and prostitute. People in the brothel often called her "Guangdong Lao Er". She was very skilled at socializing and knew how to read people's minds, so those who liked to frequent brothels were happy to go to her. Kong Fanqin, the owner of the De Tai Silver Shop at No. 43 Seward Road, visited her establishment in the spring at the invitation of a friend. He was well-received, and he repeatedly came to show his appreciation. Recently, Kong stopped visiting brothels. The woman suddenly became pregnant and hired a lawyer to sue Kong in the First Special District Local Court, claiming that Kong had said that he had no wife at home and wanted to marry her, leading her to be seduced and go to a hotel with Kong for illicit sex. Now that she was four months pregnant, Kong had not fulfilled his promise and had abandoned her. She requested that Kong be punished for abandonment and attached a civil lawsuit, requesting that Kong pay 21,000 yuan for childbirth and upbringing expenses. After being accused, Kong hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to defend himself, saying that although he had interacted with the plaintiff when she was a prostitute, there was no physical relationship. Her claim that she was a virtuous widow and that the defendant had seduced her and promised to marry her was absurd and ridiculous. Her intention was to take advantage of the fact that the defendant's reputation was at stake and that once the lawsuit was filed, his reputation would be ruined, so he would be willing to settle and pay a huge amount of money. This kind of trickery is very common in Shanghai. He requested that the court dismiss her lawsuit and punish the plaintiff for false accusation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened the court and questioned the plaintiff, Chuan Liangzhen, about her relationship with Kong. She covered her face and cried. Kong firmly denied the accusations of seduction and abandonment, stating that the plaintiff was indeed a prostitute and that the Bureau of Public Works could be investigated. As for the money he gave her, it was for entertainment expenses and she was now making false accusations. Judge Wu had already understood the nature of the case and advised the plaintiff not to rashly file a criminal charge, saying that even if, as she claimed, she was pregnant with the defendant's child, she would have to wait until after the birth to dispute the issue of identity with the defendant. At this time, there was no abandonment to speak of. However, the plaintiff, upon hearing the advice, only stated that she was willing to withdraw the attached civil lawsuit, but wanted to proceed with the criminal lawsuit. The court immediately ordered the debate to begin. The plaintiff's lawyer spoke first, saying that since the plaintiff was pregnant, the fetus had been abandoned by the defendant, but abandoning the fetus was equivalent to abandoning the mother. Then, the defendant's lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, rebutted, saying that all the plaintiff's claims were empty and obviously intended to extort money. He requested that her lawsuit be dismissed and that she be severely punished to warn against trickery. Judge Wu immediately ruled that the plaintiff's lawsuit and counterclaim were both dismissed.</p>

<h3>The Cotton Yarn Mill Association Will Issue a Notice to Comply with the Regulations on Banning Water Adulteration in Cotton</h3>
<p>Statement to Cancel the Previously Established Two Articles</p>
<p>Formulate Measures to Ban Impurities in Cotton</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Yarn Mill Association issued a notice to its members and the cotton industry yesterday, stating that it had received a letter from the National Economic Council's Cotton Industry Control Committee stating that the Interim Regulations on Banning Water Adulteration in Cotton will be implemented from October 1. The two articles of the measures established by the association on August 29 of this year will be cancelled on September 30 of this year, and all subsequent matters will be handled in accordance with the regulations. However, regarding cotton impurities (cottonseeds, seed cotton, broken leaves, small pieces, cotton branches, sand and mud, etc.), it was decided at the executive committee meeting of the association on September 26 that those within 1.5% should be deducted in accordance with the regulations as the standard for both parties when factories purchase cotton.</p>
<h3>New Information on Public Buses in Zhabei</h3>
<p>A New Route 5 is Opened from North Station to the Municipal Government Dormitory</p>
<p>Route 3 Special Bus is Changed to Regular Bus</p>
<p>All to be Implemented on October 1</p>
<p>The original Route 4 trunk line of the Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company ran from the North Station, via Baoshan Road, Tongji Road, Jiangwan Road, West Sports Association Road, Xiangyin Road, Songhu Road, Sanmin Road, Shiguang Road, Minfu Road, Fuhou Road, and to the left of the Municipal Government. Later, due to the obstruction of bridge construction on Sanmin Road, it temporarily ran on Guohuo Road. Now that the bridge has been completed, the Route 4 bus will be returned to the original route listed above. The company sees that construction and residents are increasing daily in Guohuo Road and other places, so in order to take into account the transportation needs of the city center, the vehicles from the North Station to the Municipal Government dormitory have been changed to Route 5. The route is roughly the same as Route 4, but from the North Station to Xiangyin Road, it relies on Guohuo Road, Fuxi Nei Road, from right to left, via the Municipal Government Building, to Fuxian Zuo Road, Fudong Nei Road, Funan Zuo Road, Haitong Road, and the Municipal Government dormitory as the temporary terminal. The fare has not changed (i.e., 53 copper coins for the entire route from the North Station to the dormitory). It is officially opened on October 1. It is also heard that the company's Route 3 special bus to Zhenru and South Gate will also be changed to a regular bus from that day. The terminal station will remain the same, but the fare and sub-stations will be handled with reference to the regular bus running on the wireless radio station. The bus frequency was originally 18 minutes from the North Station. Now that the special bus has been changed to a regular bus, it will run every 9 minutes.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Manufacturers Actively Participate in the National Exhibition of the Jiangxi Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chinese Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association began preparing for the National Goods Exhibition of the Jiangxi Provincial Capital, it has been actively progressing. As of yesterday, more than 90 manufacturers have participated. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Exhibition Registration</p>
<p>The association originally set yesterday as the registration deadline. In order to solicit widespread participation, the deadline has been extended by one week to October 4. As of yesterday, the participating manufacturers include Huasheng Shanghai Electric Appliance Factory, Tianchu MSG Factory, Taikang Food Company, Renfeng Textile Factory, Dingxin Textile Factory, Fuxin Cloth Factory, Limin Cloth Factory, Dachina Dachina Central Rubber Factory, Samsung Xinguang Thermos Factory, Dachina Rubber Factory, Cooperation Hardware Company, Minsheng Textile Factory, Huaou Xianghai Fine Fruit Company, Family Industry Cooperative, Yonggu Paint Factory, Yonghe Industrial Company, Shanghai Industrial Company, Dacheng Weaving Factory, Guanghua Gas Lamp Factory, Double Wheel First Brand Toothbrush Factory, Sanle Agricultural Products Cooperative, Dafeng Copper Factory, Global Minhua Umbrella Factory, Yuanchang Xin Leather Factory, Zhang Xiaoquan Gongji Yinji Xingji Scissors Factory, Yongfeng Electric Appliance Factory, and more than 90 others.</p>
<p>Announcement Statement</p>
<p>The association announced to all manufacturers yesterday that it had discovered that a printed matter resembling a notice, but not a notice, was being distributed in various places by an organization calling itself the Nanchang City Foreign Miscellaneous Goods Industry Research Association, also known as the Nanchang City Domestic Miscellaneous Goods Industry Research Institute. The wording of the printed matter seemed to oppose the association's holding of the National Goods Exhibition of the Jiangxi Provincial Capital. The reason was nothing more than that holding the exhibition of domestic goods would affect local commerce. However, because the association's holding of the Jiangxi Exhibition was initiated with the consent of the Jiangxi provincial authorities, they did not dare to openly oppose it, so they distributed this printed matter in an attempt to confuse people and sabotage it. In fact, it was a completely Monroe-style suicidal policy. The purpose of exhibiting domestic goods is to introduce domestic products and revitalize industry. Moreover, the time is short and temporary, and it will not squeeze or affect local commerce. However, the association (institute) did not examine the matter carefully and rashly issued this printed matter, which is hateful. Fearing that people would misunderstand the truth and make mistakes due to doubt, this emergency announcement is made. If there are any domestic goods manufacturers who have not participated, please come to the association to register as soon as possible. There will be no problems with the printed matter. Please do not be fooled and make mistakes. This is the announcement.</p>
<h3>Domestic Silk and Satin Factories Support the New Camp of Purely Domestic Silk and Satin</h3>
<p>The Daxin Domestic Silk and Satin Bureau at the intersection of Shilu and Sanmarlu has decided to open on October 1. Its adopted business plan is to develop and promote the strength of domestic silk and satin. The owner of the bureau, Mr. Wang Yansong, believes that the Chinese silk industry is becoming increasingly endangered under the competition and dumping of foreign goods. This phenomenon has a very important relationship with the government's policy of saving the country through production and the livelihood of the entire nation. Therefore, in order to save the silk crisis, it is not enough to talk empty words. It is necessary to build a new camp for promoting purely domestic silk and satin to fight against the attacking foreign goods and strive to win the purchasing power of silk and satin in the Shanghai market. On the one hand, it prevents people from all walks of life who love domestic silk and satin from being deceived by foreign goods that have been disguised. On the other hand, it may arouse the attention of colleagues who also sell foreign goods to rise up one after another, abandon foreign goods, and sell only domestic silk and satin, so that the promotion force can be gradually expanded, the purchasing power can be gradually concentrated, and the invading economic foreign goods will have no skills to apply due to the loss of promotion force. This proposition is welcomed by silk and satin manufacturers in Hangzhou and Shanghai. Shi Chunshan and Lou Fengshao, representatives of Zhen Dan, Lie Feng, Zhen Ya, and other major factories, have been publicly recommended to meet with Mr. Wang Yansong to express their gratitude for his enthusiasm for planning and fighting for domestic silk and satin and to express their unanimous support. Therefore, the opening of the bureau this time, with the completeness of colors and the cheapness of prices, will open an unprecedented new record. Ladies who like to use domestic silk and satin should not miss the opportunity of the bureau's opening discount.</p>
<h3>Tenants in Dexing and Other Lanes in the French Concession Demand the Return of "Small Rent"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tongren Fuyuan Hall previously built Hong Kong-style three-story buildings in Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Gongguan Road, and the original site of Qiankang Sauce Garden in 1920, and more than 200 three-story houses in Lixian and Zhizhong Lanes, Xizilaihuo Street. At that time, it had collected huge amounts of "small rent," totaling no less than 100,000 yuan, and issued receipts from the Shanghai Charity Association. As all the tenants considered the rental prices to be too high, they requested a reduction. The hall asked Wang Yiting and Lu Bohong to ask Du Yuesheng to mediate. All the rental issues were then settled. The "small rent" portion was not mentioned at the time. In recent years, the market has declined, and the tenants have been struggling to make ends meet. They have gathered with their neighbors many times to discuss the matter. Now that the Mid-Autumn Festival is over, they feel even more difficult to sustain themselves and have decided to petition Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the French Concession. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., four representatives from Dexing Lane, Zhai Yuchang, Qian Ziming, Cao Wenrong, etc., took a car to Du's residence on Huagene Road. After submitting their name cards, they were received by Du. Zhai Yuchang, as the representative, stated the course of events. Du replied that he was always concerned about the current difficult situation in the business community. He would convey everything to the representatives and do his best to help if he could. However, landlords and tenants have the closest relationship, and they should negotiate peacefully in the future, so that the middleman can also help easily. The representatives were very satisfied with Du's sincere attitude and thanked him before leaving. Here is a copy of their original petition to Du: Respectfully, Tongren Fuyuan Hall built more than 200 houses in Dexing, Lixian, and Zhizhong Lanes on Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession in 1920 and collected 80,000 to 90,000 yuan in "small rent." As Dexing Lane is located north of the main road and the market is more prosperous, the regulations required that 1,000 taels of silver be collected for each city house, and the rest ranged from 500 to 600 taels to 200 to 300 taels. When paying the money, Huang Xingjie, the director of the hall, publicly stated that because there were too few houses and too many people, the hall could not cope, so those who had to pay in cash were implying restrictions. Moreover, the construction cost was very high and the deposit had to be collected to offset it. After a few years, when the income was abundant, there would be a proper solution. At that time, the tenants had no contact beforehand and thought that the receipt given by the hall to the charity was sincere and reliable, but they did not know that they had fallen into its trick. Most of our tenants rent houses for profit, which is very different from donating money for charity. In short, the purpose of the hall is to collect "small rent" and it is prevented from setting up names by the ban of the Chinese and French authorities, so it tries to do so by trickery. But the contradiction is already obvious. If the market is still as prosperous as before, our tenants can still endure and remain silent. Now that the market has declined to this point, how should the great philanthropists in the name of charity stimulate their conscience to cover up their past mistakes? But the person in charge of the hall does not allow rent reductions and does not allow the return of "small rent," as if he is not happy until he sees all the tenants die under his iron fist. More than a dozen of our tenants have paid more and suffered more losses, so we have hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Second Special District Local Court. Although the result of the lawsuit requires the final judgment of the third trial, we believe that facts speak louder than eloquence and justice is stronger than power, and our tenants will not be silent. In addition to filing a document with the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government Social Bureau, and various groups, we are writing to your association to uphold justice and comfort the public.</p>

<h3>Barber's Guild Implements Fee Collection</h3>
<p>Fee Collectors Braving the Wind and Rain</p>
<p>Members Enthusiastically Paying Dues</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Barber's Guild announced the suspension of business for all members on September 9th, it has continued to handle the registration of members in various districts. Now, for those who have completed the process, it is implementing the collection of membership fees. Sixteen individuals with trusted reputations in the industry have been publicly elected as fee collection committee members. Recently, they began collecting fees door-to-door in the Yinqi District. Despite continuous autumn rains and muddy roads, the fee collectors braved the wind and rain, not shying away from hardship. The members in the district deeply appreciated the public sacrifice made by the fee collectors, and all enthusiastically paid their dues. It is now reported that the collection in that district is nearing completion, and they plan to continue collecting in the City, Pudong, Zhabei, and other districts soon. Once the collection in all sixteen districts is completed and the finances are consolidated, they will join the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and register with the Social Affairs Bureau in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Tianjin East Asia "Ram Brand" Wool Yarn Sells Well</h3>
<p>In recent years, the import of foreign wool yarn into the country and the outflow of money are alarming. The Tianjin East Asia Wool Spinning Company, recognizing this, has made a thorough effort to save itself, increase production, and work towards resisting this trend. Recalling this time last year, the company's "Ram Brand" wool yarn was being promoted in Shanghai for the first time. When it was first launched, outsiders generally expected that the product, being new, would be unfamiliar to many, and that purchasing power would not be strong. They viewed it with indifference. Unexpectedly, the "Ram Brand" wool yarn caused a sensation upon entering the market, showing a sudden and rapid increase in popularity. All sectors rushed to purchase it, and it sold out completely. The reasons for this are nothing more than its careful processing, accurate weight, excellent quality and reasonable price, strong tensile strength, soft texture, and durability, among other features. It is found that the company's general manager, Mr. Song Feiqing, is experienced and has keen insights. As for Mr. Huang Gongzhan, the supervising director of the East China region, he is also intelligent and capable, and brave in taking responsibility. His supervision efforts have been quite effective. It is also reported that the company's general manager for the East China region has entrusted the Shanghai China Trade Company to handle it. The address is 17 Gongguan Road, next to Bulinli. In recent days, various distributors from different regions have been coming to negotiate wholesale purchases, with an endless stream of visitors. It is learned that last year, due to its initial creation, each skein only had twenty rounds. This year, the company has revitalized its spirit, using richer materials, and each skein has twenty-six rounds. Calculating that there are sixteen skeins per pound, this is an increase of ninety-six rounds per pound compared to last year. The special price is two yuan and eight jiao per pound, with uniform prices for both local and out-of-town sales. The purchasing power and sales volume are even greater than last year. Even in Shanghai, both the China and Shanghai National Products Companies sell several hundred pounds per day. The success elsewhere is even more imaginable.</p>

They all held banquets at the hotel. Exquisite foods and wines were served, and elegant dresses were gathered. Adding to the atmosphere was the music of the Ai Er Mu Orchestra, renowned in Europe and America, with its exciting and rhythmic melodies, which reached perfection. At 10:00 PM, the variety show began. First, Di Mide Luofu played the sanxian, its sound was sonorous and intoxicating. Then, Miss Ge Lineng performed a solo dance, reminiscent of Zhao Feiyan, as light as catkin, dancing like an immortal. Tao Tao's solo was next, her voice like a string of pearls, lingering in the air for days. The Fan Laluofu dance troupe, consisting of fifteen beautiful young women, was the highlight of the evening. They performed "42nd Street" first, and then "Nian Nu Jiao," each performance perfect, nimble as dragons, as if specifically choreographed for this occasion. Mr. Bo Lai, the troupe's director, was skilled in singing, dancing, and playing the strings, with a captivating stage presence, adding much to the variety show. As the event came to a close and guests departed, both hosts and guests were delighted. Observers say that this is the most luxurious and magnificent ballroom in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Boatman Dies of Abdominal Pain After Dinner</h3>

Fearing that there might be other circumstances, the police instructed Sun Genlin, the local bailiff from the eighth district, to report the matter to the local court for examination. Subsequently, Wang Laolang reported to the court, claiming that the deceased Shen Alang was his cousin, and that he had no family in Shanghai. He stated that this was a death due to illness and that he was willing to provide a coffin and burial at his own expense and requested exemption from examination.

<h3>New Book Industry Unanimously Joins the Guild</h3>
<p>The Shanghai book industry has traditionally been divided into new and old factions due to different publishing approaches. After the establishment of the Book Industry Guild in 1928, the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce mediated a merger, but it was not implemented due to business considerations. Now, the New Book Industry Federation and the Old Book Industry are becoming closer, and there is a need for cooperation in the environment. Therefore, it was decided at the last New Book Industry dinner to unanimously join the Guild. The affairs of the existing Federation will be temporarily concluded. On one hand, Hong Xuefan, a member of the Guild's executive committee, was entrusted to introduce them. In the first group, there are thirteen companies: Kaiming, New China, Guanghua, New Life, Children's, Pacific, Tianma, Nanquang, Shenzhou, Liming, Huatong, Lehua, and Sanyou. Their membership was unanimously approved by the Guild's executive and supervisory board meeting yesterday and welcomed. Those who have not yet joined are being contacted separately.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, Greetings: In the news section of your newspaper on the 27th of this month, the article about the Shunan ship being detained in Sandu'ao mentions that the wife of the first mate, Sheng Fuchen, brought a handwritten letter from Sheng to report to the Maritime Affairs Bureau. After investigation, she did not bring a letter to report to the Maritime Affairs Bureau. This is inconsistent with the facts. Please include this in the letter column for correction to avoid confusion. With best wishes, Sheng Shasuheng (Address: 4, Lane 28, Houjie, South City South Hall) September 27th.</p>
<p>Errata: On the 27th, the article "Savings Account Holders of the Five Hua Bank Sue" had the sub-headline "The Defendants Were All Absent During Yesterday's Trial." The character (被) [bei, defendant] was mistakenly printed as (原) [yuan, original]. In the report on the 28th, the seventh case of the executive and supervisory board meeting of the Lawyers Association, "Lawyers Jiang Pan and Zhu Yuanzhang et al. Apply for Membership," was missing the character (章) [zhang]. We urgently correct these.</p>

<h3>Little West Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Becoming a Merchant Entering the Folk Road Returning to Yongshou Leaving Home The Heavenly Person Arriving in Chang'an</p>
<p>What is called a bus station, you may find it funny, is actually widening the shop door a bit so that buses can drive in when they are free. In the courtyard, several earthen houses are connected, and the outer walls allow cars to drive into the houses. Since the houses are gone, behind the courtyard is an upright earthen slope with several semi-oval caves dug into it. These caves are kiln caves. Needless to say, going inside to rest, even standing outside, the dark depths emit an unpleasant smell. But if you don't go in, there is no other place to rest your feet. There's no choice but to harden your heart and carry your luggage inside. Fortunately, I brought a folding camp bed to set up on the earthen pit and sleep. At least I'm not touching the dirt on all sides. When it comes to eating, another problem arises. In the Qianzhou area, pork and eggs can always be bought. But here, neither is available. Fortunately, the shop still has twenty or so black flour buns left that they can sell to me. I said it doesn't matter if there are no vegetables, just buy some white sugar to dip the black buns in and eat. I discussed this with the shopkeeper, and he laughed, saying that if I wanted to eat white sugar, I would have to run back twenty miles to the military supervisor town to buy it. I thought, how could a proper county town not have white sugar? I suspected that the shopkeeper was lying. The next day, I got up early and went into the city to take a look. Who knew that these dozen or so households outside the city were the essence of the entire county. Inside the city was a main road between two earthen hills. The city wall, with pieces missing, circled half of the earthen hilltop, even smaller than the large village I saw in Henan. Climbing up the earthen hill and looking at the entire city, there were wheat fields planted high and low on the hillside. To the north, there were two households: an elementary school and the company headquarters of the city garrison. To the south, there were two households: a deserted old county government office and a city god temple. Besides these, there were only a few kiln caves used as official residences. According to my subsequent investigation, the entire city, including the yin-yang government, consisted of eight households in total. (28)</p>
<h3>Schoolbag</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>We Chinese are, after all, a land of literature, so even the (schoolbag) alone has various different styles, as well as a history of change and evolution.</p>
<p>I haven't heard or seen what schoolbags looked like during the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, so I wouldn't dare make wild guesses. But it is said that during the Daoguang, Xianfeng, Tongzhi, and Guangxu periods, our great-grandfathers and grandfathers used only a square of blue cloth, about four square feet in size, and a blue cloth strap.</p>
<p>This kind of schoolbag has now disappeared. I'm afraid it can't even be found in the ancient relics museum. When we went to school, blue cloth schoolbags were no longer used. The books were wrapped in rice-colored feather yarn and clipped under the arm with a hairpin or button. It was very fashionable. This was the schoolbag of the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China.</p>
<p>After the revolution, schoolbags also underwent a revolution, abandoning the parcel style and adopting leather schoolbag straps. The narrow leather strap held the books tightly, and anyone could clearly see what books were inside. So everyone loved to carry a few Western-style books to show an indescribable glory.</p>
<p>Leather schoolbag straps were most suitable for university students, so elementary school students used a schoolbag like a postman's mailbag, partly for convenience and partly to hide what books were inside.</p>
<p>Leather schoolbag straps became outdated, and small suitcases took their place. Students of all levels switched to small suitcases, especially girls, because they could hide plenty of cosmetics inside.</p>
<p>But modern university students all use briefcases as schoolbags.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Jian Fen)</p>
<p>(Studying) is like eating an olive; the initial taste is bitter, but what follows the bitterness is an indescribable sweetness.</p>
<p>When working, one often feels that one's knowledge is insufficient for application; however, when (studying), one often feels that (studying) is a tedious task.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Women's Filial Hair Bun</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Shaoxing, the first thing that strikes one is the manure tanks in front of every household and the remnants of the feudal era, such as plaques with inscriptions like "(Residence of a) Grandee" and "Brothers Achieving Degrees Together." Secondly, one should note the women's hair buns worn for mourning.</p>
<p>Shaoxing women rarely cut their hair. Behind their heads, they all retain a round hair bun. This refers to women who are not in mourning. If they are in mourning, they tightly wrap the hair bun with white string, neatly and methodically. There is nothing strange about this kind of white bun; it can be seen in Hangzhou and other places as well. What is striking is that the Shaoxing women's mourning buns also have a semi-circular frame tied on top, towering shakily above their heads. Viewed from behind, the entire white bun looks like a small gong; the semi-circular frame looks like a rope threaded through the gong, with a hand holding it in the air.</p>
<p>I don't know what the use of this semi-circular frame on the white bun is. If it is for aesthetic reasons, it doesn't seem to be so. According to my thinking, this is probably still a remnant of when women were taken as spoils of war. In the past, women have always been regarded by men as the same as livestock, and could be plundered at will. Of course, it would not work to pull them along by their hands and feet; therefore, one could only drag them by their hair. Later, the men became clever and felt that dragging the hair was also not a good idea, so they tied the women's hair into a round knot. In this way, whether lifting or dragging, it seemed much more convenient. This is the same as when we buy a chicken or duck, and holding its wings is tiring, it is better to tie its legs with a straw rope, tie a round knot at one end, and then hang it upside down in the hand. Over time, women also forgot that the round knot on their hair bun was for men to plunder, so they combed it especially neatly, like the mourning buns seen in Shaoxing today.</p>
<p>The above is my speculation, I don't know if it is correct. If it is correct, then women are truly pitiful. As for women who are not in mourning, the reason why they do not add a semi-circular frame to their buns is probably a mark of "(property being) owned."</p>
<h3>The Student Trilogy - Part Three (University Era)</h3>
<h3>Reflections on Japanese and Manchurian Enterprises (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Without food and clothing, one will freeze and starve to death, but if there is a source of food and clothing, and life continues, then descendants will inherit the industry, which means that life can continue endlessly. Airplanes and bombs can kill people and destroy objects, but they cannot exterminate our race or destroy our life force, so what is there to fear? If the human heart does not die, then there is no place where one cannot live. Nothing is more sorrowful than the death of the heart, and people today are only seeking life in a dead end, and are ignorant of the way to seek life, abandoning the fundamental for the superficial, which is truly a terminal illness. In the "Tidbits" of the "Spring and Autumn" column, someone said that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are certainly miraculous remedies for saving the world, but unfortunately there is a prescription but no medicine. They do not know that medicines are originally abundant in the universe, waiting for people to use them, just like the five grains and six domestic animals, although they are born from nature, they also need to be raised by people. Instead of seeking this, they must be like Emperor Qin seeking immortality overseas. Even if they can achieve abstinence and become immortal, after their corpse decomposes, the soul does not die, and the immortal still wants to descend to earth, which is nothing more than a repeated cycle. Therefore, the reversal of extremes is an inevitable principle. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame have reached the extreme of being completely eliminated in recent years, so it is only natural that they will be reborn like yin at the summer solstice and yang at the winter solstice. If we use medicinal prescriptions as a comparison, then there is no difference between Chinese and Western medical principles, but there are many who know that it is so but do not know why. The Japanese managing the Northeast is precisely using our country's prescriptions, utilizing the medicinal materials in our mountains and underground, to save their country from poverty and disease, while we must seek overseas immortal prescriptions, looking for medicines that we do not have, and instead use the medicines we have to provide for others' giving and taking. I truly cannot understand this after a hundred thoughts, so I write this chaotic note prompted by a few lines of report, to offer it for the "Spring and Autumn" brush to abridge, and also to leave it for my wandering life.</p>

<h3>How to Remove Stains from Clothes</h3>
<p>— Qingzhuang</p>
<p>If you carelessly get stains on your clothes, you must feel very upset. Now I will tell you a convenient way to remove these stains.</p>
<p>If the stains have been there for too long, then it will be difficult to completely remove them; you can only make them faint enough to deceive people's eyes. Therefore, to remove stains, it is best to do it as soon as possible, otherwise it may be difficult.</p>
<p>There are only two ways to remove stains: mechanical and chemical; in chemical methods, they can be divided into dry methods and wet methods. The volatile chemicals used in the dry method should preferably not interfere with the fiber and dyed colors.</p>
<p>Now I will write down the types of stains and the methods of removal below: 丨丨</p>
<p>Oil Stains: Oil and grease stains are often mechanically attached. These stains can be removed with red oil and soap solution or Benzene.</p>
<p>Wax Resin: After drying, gradually remove most of it with a small knife, then apply Benzene, wait for a while, and rub vigorously. If it still cannot be removed, then mix magnesium oxide and Benzene into a circular object, apply it to the stain, and brush it off after it is dry. Then the stain can be completely removed, and it will not interfere with the color.</p>
<p>Rust Stains: In summer, white summer clothes often have small yellow spots, which ordinary people mistakenly believe to be fly droppings. If they are faint marks, they can be washed off with a concentrated solution of acetic acid and oxalic acid. If they are deep and dark marks, then first apply tin powder to the stain, and then treat it with acetic acid and oxalic acid using the same method as above; if it still cannot be removed, then first moisten the stain with warm water, then apply a mixture of citric acid and tartaric acid, and then wash it off with water; however, the above three methods cannot be applied to colored clothes. If colored clothes have rust stains, then you can mix soap water and glycerin and apply it to the stained area, leave it for two to three hours, and most of it can be removed. It will be clean after washing.</p>
<p>Ink Stains: Ink stains other than black can be removed by washing with soap, but this method cannot be applied to colored objects. For ink stains on colored objects, use alcohol and an equal amount of iodine water and apply it with a pen, 丨丨 need to apply it several times 丨丨 can mostly eliminate it. If it is white cotton fabric, then after using the above method, bleach it with bleaching powder. If it is silk or wool fabric, then wash it with a mixture of iodine water and soap solution, or add zinc powder to acidic sodium sulfite solution and shake it, then moisten the stained area with this solution, and it can be removed after slight heating.</p>
<p>Black Ink Stains: After washing with soap solution, treat it with the iron rust stain treatment method, and the marks can be removed, because black ink contains iron.</p>
<p>Mold Stains: After drying, brush it clean with a brush, and then wash it with a thin solution of iodine water, and most of it can be removed, but if the discoloration is caused by mold spots, then the marks are simply impossible to completely eliminate.</p>
<p>Sweat Stains: If it hasn't been too long, then it can be removed by washing with water, otherwise, wash it with iodine water.</p>
<p>Fruit Juice Stains: Wash with a mixed solution of borax water and iodine water. If it cannot be removed, then use the bleaching method.</p>
<p>Wine and Sugar Stains: If it hasn't been too long, use water first, otherwise, treat it with the fruit juice stain removal method. If too much time has passed, it cannot be removed.</p>
<p>Tobacco Tar Stains: Remove with wax gourd juice and winter melon juice.</p>
<p>Blood Stains: Moisten the stain with milk and then absorb it with blotting paper.</p>
<p>Ink Stains: Apply a thick glue solution to the stained area, scrape it off carefully with a small knife after it is dry, or wash it with a small amount of salt water, then rub it with rice grains, and finally wash it with water. This method has the best results, but it often damages the fabric.</p>
<h3>Record of Fragrant Clouds</h3>
<p>— Originally by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This is certainly very disappointing! In fact, these kinds of formalities are very ordinary for the Empress Dowager, part of her daily life. There's not a day without them, and they practically surround the Empress Dowager everywhere, not letting her have a moment of peace. However, the situation is somewhat different. In the past, the many rituals performed in the palace all day and night, although said to be because the Empress Dowager herself was unwilling to relax too much, were always very solemn in form. But in any case, everyone could not permanently maintain the tense and active spirit of this overly skilled performance. This time, during the welcoming ceremony held at Tianjin Station, everyone felt a relatively excited mood, like people feeling every time they encounter some festive day. What was especially different was that almost everyone had some of the joy of travel, revealed in their expressions.</p>
<p>Although the Empress Dowager was now also sitting upright in her small court on the train, her line of sight was no longer concentrated on the many jade and antique trinkets held by the small wooden shelves on the car wall; she was just watching that lucky little dog and those two newly arrived parrots without blinking. Her intention seemed to be to know what special actions the dog would do when it saw the parrots, and the parrots would do when they saw the dog. Even I was full of hope that these two kinds of animals, now that they had been placed together, would inevitably have new incidents occurring in this small court. Who knew that the reality was exactly the opposite of the ideal; the dog had no interest in the parrots at all, as if it had not seen them. This has already proven that although the dog has a somewhat more peculiar appearance, its intelligence is still no different from that of ordinary dogs, 丨丨 perhaps even more stupid. I really don't understand why the Empress Dowager alone likes it? (138)</p>

<h3>Detailed Record of Tung Wah's Victory over Zhenhuan in the Sensational Football Match in Peiping</h3>
<p>Three to One, Zhenhuan Recaptured a Goal at the End</p>
<p>(Peiping Special Dispatch) Shanghai's Tung Wah Football Team clashed with Zhenhuan Football Team for the first time in Peiping today (27th). The battle began at 4:30 PM at the Fire Brigade football field. It was indeed a fierce battle. More than 5,000 Peiping citizens who admired their names went to watch. The Fire Brigade field was so crowded that the entrance was impenetrable, and the scene of bustling traffic was unprecedented. Tickets were priced at sixty cents and thirty cents respectively, which was not cheap, but the number of tickets sold that day was no less than 4,000. The four sides of the field were surrounded by railings, and the stands on the south side were densely packed with heads. Those who arrived late had no place to stand. Just after 4 o'clock, the players from both sides successively came onto the field. After briefly testing their footwork, the game began. Wang Zhensheng was the referee. He raised his arm high, and with a "嘎" sound, the silver whistle blew long. The athletes on both sides each secured their positions, and in an instant, the personnel and horses arrived together, and the killing intent lurked. The original formations of both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah Team</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen, Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, Chen Hongguang, Feng Yunyou, Zhao Aisheng (Down), Feng Nianhan (Up)</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua, Li Yiju, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, Fu Zhibin</p>
<p>Zhenhuan Team</p>
<p>Wang Yumin, Jin Adu, Chuan Xinqiu, Xu Feimin (Down), Lin Songfa (Up), An Yuansheng, Li Fenglou</p>
<p>Wu Guicheng, Yan Chengkuan, Lian Xuanxun, Wang Jingxi, Zhang Zhizhen (Up), Tang Guoliang (Down)</p>
<p>Tung Wah attacked from the east, and Zhenhuan attacked from the west. Cao Qiuting, on the right wing of Tung Wah, was injured in the leg during a match in Shanghai and has not yet recovered, so he did not play and was replaced by Fu Zhibin, which reduced his strength a lot. Zhenhuan's lineup had no major changes. Opening the lineup, several melee battles were indistinguishable. However, Zhenhuan took the offensive, approaching the enemy's position twice, but unfortunately did not hit. Tung Wah's team was indeed veterans. They were unwilling to work hard unless they encountered a strong enemy. Zhenhuan boldly invaded, and that's when they perked up. The vanguard tightened the reins, and the center forward responded on the road. With one burst of energy, they rushed forward. Feng Yunyou advanced in the middle, and Dai Linjing and Li Yichen assisted from the left and right.</p>
<p>Experiencing two dangerous situations, Zhenhuan also changed its approach, calling back the three armies and intensifying its defense. However, Tung Wah gained an inch and pressed forward step by step. At this time, the Zhenhuan defenders were already enraged, repeatedly wanting to counterattack, but they were insufficient in strength. Finally, surrounded on all sides, trapped on the left and right, relying on several struggles, they failed to turn danger into safety. Jin Adu, eager for his team, mistakenly went it alone. A few paces in front of the two-door line, Feng Yunyou took the penalty kick, raised his foot and struck. The ball hit the south corner post.</p>
<p>Although it was escaped, it was also fortunate. Less than five minutes into the battle, Feng Yunyou got another chance to take a penalty kick. The ball brushed the top of the door and went out at an angle. The Zhenbao team was indeed lucky, but the accuracy of Tung Wah's vanguard's shot left the audience disappointed. Tung Wah, seeing that the attack was fruitless, also relaxed. Zhenbao, seeing that their own luck was prosperous, bet that the battle would definitely be victorious. The forwards joined forces in one place and attacked from the left. With the help of Ge Chengbao, Wu Guicheng took advantage of the situation and struck, heading straight for the Tung Wah gate. Lu Zhongen failed to stop it, and was surrounded by Zhenhuan's forwards. A burst of mud and smoke rose everywhere. Therefore,</p>
<p>It was also a failure for Zhenhuan to attack the gate. Wu Guicheng sent a corner kick. Wang Jingxi and Zhang Zhizhen rushed forward to attack the gate, but both were shut out. But it annoyed the Tung Wah defender Li Ning. One foot stood firmly, and one foot was energized, aiming at the ball, and it was a kick. Vanguard Fu Zhibin saw an opportunity in the front line and fell back, so the ball landed next to Fu. As soon as it was said, the little ball rolled along the ground towards Zhen's empty city, and the goalkeeper could not save it, so he was hit by a ball,</p>
<p>After the re-opening, Zhenhuan tried hard to counterattack, but ultimately failed to immediately recapture the city due to low morale. In the first half, Tung Wah ate twice as much, and after moisturizing their throats with lime, they changed defenses and fought each other, and their energy was restored, which was even more exciting. Before the battle had begun for a moment, Li Yichen charged into the heavy group alone and attacked the mountain gate fiercely. The ball was fast and low, rubbing the ground and shooting in. By the time Zhen's goalkeeper stood firm, he knew that</p>
<p>Tung Wah's army came to invade the territory again after 15 minutes. Dai Linjing led the army and rushed back and forth, taking advantage of the smoke to break in. The gate of Zhenhuan was in chaos for a while, and all the rescue was obtained, but they were not hit. Finally, they were annoyed, and Li Yichen made a comeback, and Wan Xianghua took the opportunity to attack from the side, so that</p>
<p>At this time, Zhenhuan was calling in vain, unable to attack and unable to realize the retreat. So they changed their tactics and made a sound in the east and attacked in the west, and it worked. Li Fenglou intercepted the ball and sent it out in one foot. Guan Yongkuan continued to rotate and go up, and went straight to Huanglong. Tung Wah team was not easy to transfer back because the large army was outside, resulting in an empty city, and it was too heavy on the enemy after the victory, and there were only two defenders, the goalkeeper and Li Ning, and it was difficult to stop the enemy. At this time, the surrounding spectators shouted and cheered, and the sound of refueling was endless, but the Zhenhuan team was exhausted and hoarse because they had been fighting against the enemy for a long time, and they were unable to do anything. In the second half, Zhenhuan still lost, with a score of two to one. The overall result was three to one, and Tung Wah won.</p>

<h3>Chiu Fei-hai's Letter Clarifying Cooperation Agreement with Meiyuan</h3>
<p>(Original Letter) The Shanghai Tennis Association and Mr. Scott, the initiator of the Meiyuan Indoor Sports Field, have already established a cooperative arrangement, which Fei-hai has personally been involved in negotiating. Both parties have benefited, so I greatly support this move. In the past, when Shanghai hosted inter-port or other tennis competitions, rain or sudden changes in weather often caused difficulties in scheduling. Even if the audience was not clearly informed of the definite time, players coming from afar often suffered various losses due to postponements. If we cooperate with the Meiyuan Sports Field, then rain and other difficulties can be eliminated. Moreover, the Meiyuan Indoor Sports Field has courts of suitable dimensions and spacious seating for spectators. This statement is made for clarification. Sincerely, Chiu Fei-hai. (Editor's Note: Mr. Chiu previously sent a letter denying cooperation with the Meiyuan project, which was reported by this newspaper, Shen Bao, the other day. Now, he has personally sent a letter expressing cooperation, suggesting that a satisfactory agreement has been reached. This matter should have positive implications for the future of the tennis community, so we have included this note to show the development.)</p>

<h3>Agricultural and Forestry Land Economic Survey by Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Institute</h3>
<p>Completed in the Four Provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui</p>
<p>Currently Under Investigation in Guangdong</p>
<p>The Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Institute, recognizing the lack of emphasis on actual social conditions in Chinese statistical figures, which has led to a lack of insight and the reliance on idealism for various problem facilities, has made on-site investigation its primary task since its establishment. It has organized various investigation teams to conduct survey work, which is detailed below.</p>
<p>The investigation of agricultural, forestry, rural land, and economic issues in the four provinces is related to the political order and stability of China and the safety and well-being of the people. The institute's research department began studying land and economic issues early on and urgently needed to investigate the actual situation. Therefore, it organized a rural land economic investigation team to first go to Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces to investigate the actual situation, including farmers' livelihoods, rural order, and agricultural production, which were listed as figures for research reference. The investigation was conducted by Qi Qisheng and others, and it has been completed, with a wealth of information collected and currently being organized.</p>
<p>The Guangdong agricultural and forestry survey and Guangdong rural economic survey team were jointly organized by the institute and Lingnan University to investigate the general economic situation of rural areas in five or three counties of Guangdong Province, as well as the economic conditions of a village with more than 1,000 households. Chen Hansheng was hired as the director to conduct the investigation. The institute is responsible for five-sixths of the budget, and Lingnan University is responsible for one-sixth. The investigation is currently underway and is expected to be completed this year.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Radio Weekly</p>
<h3>New Type of Loudspeaker</h3>
<p>— One Who Knows</p>
<p>Ordinary driving system dynamic loudspeakers have shortcomings when used in powerful amplifiers. First, when the voice coil moves in the gap of the magnetic field, its intensity is often greater at the inner end than at the outer end, making it difficult to balance and easily causing sound distortion. Second, the flexible wire connectors between the matching transformer and the voice coil are prone to interruptions.</p>
<p>Radio researchers have recently discovered an improved new type of loudspeaker. The principle and usage method were published in the American "Radio Amateur" magazine. A brief translation and introduction are provided here, as shown in Figures A and B. A is a special type of armature made of silicon steel sheets from a transformer L1, L2, L3, and L4. The four coils are wound on this armature. These four coils are connected as shown in the figure. The two ends of L1 and L4 are connected to the plates of the push-pull amplifier's two vacuum tubes as the output circuit (similar to the primary coil of a transformer). LM is a movable voice coil. This new type of loudspeaker is slightly different from ordinary dynamic loudspeakers in terms of structure and effect. The structure is simpler, and its magnetic field is automatically excited by the strong plate current, which is proportional to the intensity of the sound wave current.</p>
<h3>A B C</h3>
<p>The voice coil LM is a closed-circuit inductance placed in the center of the iron core, as shown in Figures A, B, and C. The double-arrow shape in the figure indicates the direction of the DC flow of the plate current, which is used to excite the magnetic field. The single-arrow shape indicates the direction of the instantaneous AC current variation. The magnetic field is connected to the armature by DC current, making the intensity fixed, which is represented by solid lines. The magnetic field is input by the audio AC current from the plate current, resulting in a changing state, which is represented by dashed lines. The change in the magnetic lines of force in the middle of the armature causes the induction voice coil (also known as the dynamic coil) to form an AC circuit. The magnetic lines of force of this fixed magnetic field have an opposite effect on the induced current of the LM voice coil, causing the voice coil to move. This movement direction can be forward or backward, like a piston on a steam engine; or it can be circular, like an armature on an electric motor; however, this depends on how the four fixed coils are connected.</p>
<p>If one wants to make one of the above two actions, such as piston action, then the connection method is as shown in Figure C.</p>
<h3>Causes of Open Circuits in Low-Frequency Transformers</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Everyone knows the importance of low-frequency transformers in radios and broadcasting equipment. However, they have a very annoying problem: they are often prone to open circuits.</p>
<p>Initially, most people thought that the reason for transformer open circuits was that the wires used were too thin and burned out due to current overload. However, the fact is not that simple.</p>
<p>Someone spent twelve US dollars to buy a large low-frequency transformer (wound with thicker wires), thinking that they could rest easy. Who knew that it would fail within a week! Later, they replaced it with a small transformer worth only two Chinese dollars, but it continued to work perfectly for more than ten months.</p>
<p>Over the years, the author has wound many low-frequency transformers using wires of different thicknesses and conducted dozens of experiments. The results show that:</p>
<p>Only a small number of low-frequency transformer failures are caused by current overload. The majority of failures are caused by corrosion due to moisture.</p>
<p>This is not just hearsay; there is evidence to prove it:</p>
<p>1. The primary coil of a typical low-frequency transformer is usually wound with 40-gauge wire. Although the specified allowable current for this type of wire is only 0.06 amperes, it actually requires a current of more than three amperes to burn it out.</p>
<p>2. Two transformers wound with the same gauge wire, one used in the detector tube (i.e., the first stage of low-frequency amplification, usually with a plate current of about one milliampere), and the other used as an output transformer for the final stage power tube (usually with a plate current of more than 30 milliamperes). In theory, the second one should fail first, but in fact, the opposite is often true! Isn't this strange?</p>
<p>In fact, the reason is very simple. As mentioned above, most transformer failures are caused by corrosion due to moisture. We know that heat is proportional to the square of the current (Heat = l2Rt). In other words, the greater the current passing through the wire, the higher the temperature generated. High temperatures keep the transformer dry, making it less susceptible to moisture and less likely to corrode.</p>
<p>If the reader doesn't believe it, they can disassemble a damaged transformer and carefully examine the location of the open circuit. They will often easily find green mold spots, but rarely see any signs of burning. Isn't this obvious proof?</p>
<p>As for the reasons why the wires corrode, I must also add a word:</p>
<p>1. Careless winding Many crudely made transformers have their coils wound by hand. If the worker winding the coils has acidic substances or sweat on their hands, then the occurrence of corrosion is to be expected.</p>
<p>2. Improper soldering When soldering the ends of the transformer coils, one should absolutely avoid using fluxes containing acids. Otherwise, corrosion will inevitably occur over time, leading to an open circuit.</p>
<p>3. Insecure sealing No matter how carefully you wind and solder the transformer, if the sealing is not secure, it will be damaged by external moisture over time. Transformers are particularly prone to damage during the rainy season for this reason. Some well-sealed transformers, it is said, can be immersed in water for more than a month without being affected at all.</p>
<p>4. Improper location If the radio is placed in a damp place or near a wall, then the chance of an open circuit will naturally be particularly high.</p>
<p>In addition, severe vibrations, internal short circuits, or sudden interruptions of plate current during use can all cause an open circuit. Due to space limitations, I will not elaborate further here.</p>
<h3>Several Uses of a Useful Thing - Shellac</h3>
<p>— Mediocre Words</p>
<p>Shellac is a type of foreign dry lacquer, commonly sold in paint stores at a very low price. This substance has many uses in radio, as it can be used as a highly insulating paint and as a "universal adhesive." I will briefly describe a few of its uses below:</p>
<p>Before using shellac, it should first be dissolved in alcohol. Take any amount of alcohol, place it in a glass bottle, and then place the glass bottle in hot water to warm it. Then add a small amount of shellac, dissolving and adding until it no longer dissolves, to obtain a shellac alcohol solution, which can be used for the following purposes.</p>
<p>A. Method of making bakelite substitutes Take dry plywood and apply the shellac alcohol solution two or three times to obtain a bakelite substitute that is easy to drill holes in and not easy to crack.</p>
<p>B. Self-made insulation wire method Take several feet of 18-gauge double silk-covered wire, apply the shellac alcohol solution two or three times, and wait for it to dry to obtain inexpensive, high-quality, and convenient insulation wire, which is ideal for soldering radios.</p>
<p>C. Use as a fixing agent for wires The shape of the coils in wavemeters and shortwave radios must not be changed in the slightest, so as not to change their inductance. You can apply the shellac alcohol solution two or three times so that their shape will not change.</p>
<p>D. Repairing cracks in the paper cone of a loudspeaker You can also apply this substance to repair cracks in the paper cone of a loudspeaker, so that the sound can be as clear as usual.</p>
<p>E. Universal adhesive Shellac is a universal adhesive that can be used to bond almost any solid material (including metal), and the joints are not afraid of moisture. For example, if a bakelite board is cracked, you can apply the shellac alcohol solution to the cracks, put the broken pieces together and let it sit, and it will bond tightly when dry.</p>
<h3>Marconi's New Invention - Radio Lighthouse</h3>
<p>— Lv Zhong</p>
<p>Radio inventor Marconi stood in the pilot house of his yacht, the "Electra," which he used for experiments, with a triumphant smile on a certain day last month, testing his recently successfully invented radio lighthouse (Theradioligboncuse) to guide the yacht. The windows of the yacht's pilot house were completely covered with curtains, so that the outside could not be seen. Marconi and the captain blindly drove, and were able to safely enter the Italian port of Sesinilevante.</p>
<p>Marconi's development of radio has saved the lives of millions of people in distress. However, this radio lighthouse can save millions of steamers when they enter port in dense fog and heavy rain, to avoid the disaster of collisions. Therefore, Marconi called it a great invention.</p>
<p>The experiment set up an ultra-shortwave transmitting station on a cape 300 feet high on the sea surface at the entrance of the port of Sesinilevante; there were also two radio lighthouses (please refer to the attached figure) with small shortwave transmitters placed on two floating stations at the entrance of the harbor, about 300 feet apart.</p>
<p>There was a receiver on the yacht, equipped with two indicators; one was visible, with an instrument like an electric meter, and the pointer on the meter moved to the left or right depending on the direction the ship was sailing; the other was audible, indicating from the loudspeaker that the ship's direction was wrong.</p>
<p>The signal emitted by the main transmitter was relayed by the radio lighthouse and then received by the yacht. When the ship continued to sail in the direction of the target location between the two radio lighthouses, the pointer on the indicator would point directly to the center. If the pointer was deflected to one side, it meant that the ship's direction was too far to the left or too far to the right. When the "Electra" yacht safely entered the port, Marconi and the captain were driving blindly, never observing the coastline or pilot lines. Marconi said: "Every port in the world will definitely use this radio direction finder in the next few years."</p>
<p>The audible indicator can emit two kinds of signals from the loudspeaker, one is high-pitched and the other is low-pitched. When the ship is sailing in the direction of the target location, the signal always remains at a normal pitch. But if the ship deviates to one side, the loudspeaker will emit a high-pitched or low-pitched sound, warning the driver to pay attention to how the course is wrong on the visible indicator.</p>
<h3>Modification of a Radio Phonograph Connector</h3>
<p>— Lin Guiling</p>
<p>After seeing Mr. Mingxiang's excellent work (Radio Phonograph Connector) in the 71st issue of this magazine, the author thought about making one, but was troubled by the lack of spare parts. So I modified it and took the spare parts completely from an old radio. According to the test results, the performance is indeed good. When connected to a homemade TRF AC five-tube radio, the sound is very loud, similar to receiving a local 100-watt or more radio station with an antenna, which is much better than connecting to the grid circuit of the detector tube.</p>
<p>Fellow sufferers! Comrades who are troubled by the constraints of spare parts, you may wish to try it when you have time.</p>
<p>This is just a reference. I hope comrades will use your intelligence to make more improvements. Maybe you will find even better results?</p>
<p>Note: Please refer to Mr. Mingxiang's excellent work in the 71st issue of this magazine for the method of use.</p>

<h3>Gold Standard Falls Again</h3>
<p>| To 908 Yuan |</p>
<p>The Hope for a New Record Has Yet to Disappear</p>
<p>Buyers Helpless, Resulting in Another Drop of 7.6 Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market's downward trend continues. Yesterday, it created a new low price of 908 yuan, which has frightened people and depressed the market atmosphere. In one day, the downward trend was miserable, and the hope for a new record has yet to disappear. In the early morning, although the London and New York silver markets rose slightly, the increase was not much. London spot gold rose by 1.5 pence, and the exchange rate opened weaker but closed stronger. American cotton continued to fall, while American wheat rose, and stocks also rose. Preliminary trading opened steadily, rising slightly to 22-23 yuan. However, the fact that the English and Japanese banks reportedly closed lower at .0625 after the market closed, even though there was a slight increase today, still made people generally feel unfavorable and start selling. It once fell into the 20 yuan range, but demand exceeded supply at low prices, so it gradually pulled up after the market opened. At this time, people's hearts were stable, so although the banks were tight, the domestic market was still tight. The news that HSBC's exchange rates for the US and the UK remained unchanged caused buyers to become active and rise, but the overall trend did not show a reversal. The phenomenon stopped at high prices, and the bulls still wavered, so a fluctuating situation appeared. People's hearts were like walking on thin ice. As soon as there were sellers, the downward trend intensified. When the 20 yuan range was broken, the selling intensified even more. Even if there were people maintaining at low prices, they were no match for the crowd. Sellers followed one after another, and people's hopes for a new record became more obvious. The exchange rate also became stronger, and the downward trend became more difficult to control. Although there was no special news, rumors slightly deteriorated, and it gradually fell. Later, Chinese merchants continued to fill US dollars, and the forward price even hardened to 37 yuan, making it difficult to sell, and even broke the 10 yuan range, creating a new low price of 908 yuan. Short covering slightly started, and the banks took the opportunity to force up, allowing the gold market to rise by 5 yuan. Unexpectedly, a telegram from Bombay reported a rise of 9 annas, and selling started again, but the 10 yuan range was difficult to break again. Soon, the rumor that the Central Bank was opening spot positions spread, and the domestic market gradually tightened. Buyers showed signs of recovery, and because the second telegram from Bombay reported a retraction of 1 anna, there were signs of a turnaround. The final situation was tight and stable, and there were no special changes. Now, the market conditions for the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 920.5 yuan, down 1.5 yuan from the previous close. The exchange rate opened with a recent selling price. The exchange rate for the UK was 1 shilling 5 pence 5625 and 625, and the exchange rate for the US was 36.4375 yuan, which then fell to 0.3 yuan, but was very stable. Hengyu, Hengxingyuan, and Dadecheng entered at 1.4 yuan, and Wahbi came out with half a yuan for US dollars in November. Hengxing sold to 0.07 yuan. Predicting that HSBC's exchange rates for the US and the UK would not change, Hengyu, Dafayong, Yongli, Fuan, Shenkang, Yuanfengyong, Bingxing, Zhaofengchang, Yuankangxiang, and Yongli entered orders, gradually rising to 3.8 yuan. Fuchang, Hengyu, and Fuan took advantage of the high price to sell. Sumitomo filled 0.5625 US dollars for December, falling to 2.5 yuan. Yuanchangyong and Yuankangxiang still rose to 3.6 yuan. Mitsui came out with 0.5 yuan in November and 0.5625 in December. Dingkang, Fuan, Yuanmaoyong, Dafayong, Tianfeng, Dalianbang, etc. sold orders and saw downstream. Later, the situation suddenly weakened. Large customers such as Yuanyi, Yuanmaoyong, and Dalianbang sold fiercely, and the selling suddenly went crazy. Although there were scattered shorts covering at low prices, Fuxingyong also entered, once rising from 18.8 yuan to 9.9 yuan, but Fuan, Yuankangxiang, and Fuxingyong suddenly sold and fell to 6.5 yuan. Mitsui even filled US dollars at 0.75 in January. Hengyu, Fuxingyong, etc. came in and rose back to 8.5 yuan, but the market situation was extremely vague and people's hearts were miserable. Although Dadecheng, Hengyu, Hengxing, etc. repeatedly entered orders at low prices, it was difficult to stop the selling. Dakang, Yuanfengyong, Zhengchang, Yuanmaoyong, Qingyu, Yifengyong, Dingchang, and Yuqingyong sold within 6 yuan. Hengxing and Yuqingyong entered orders, pulling up more than 1 yuan. Shanghai bought US dollars at 0.8125 in January. However, supply exceeded demand. Dadecheng, Yifengyong, Hongkangyong, Xianghe, etc. sold fiercely. Yifengyong sold the most intensely, falling by 3.1 yuan. Hengxing, Yicheng, and Yuqingyong entered orders and gradually rose to 6 yuan.

Although the banks were conservative after the opening, both GBP and USD listed prices from HSBC Bank did not change. Chinese merchants had good psychology, and the process tightened, but the banks were still willing to supply. When the gold market suffered a sharp drop, Chinese merchants repeatedly sold off, and the situation became loose and excessive. Although the banks took the opportunity to buy low to replenish, they could not save the overall situation. In the noon market, it seemed that there was an excess of supply over demand. In the afternoon market, Chinese merchants continued to sell off fiercely, and the USD forward rate reached 37 yuan, but the banks tried hard to buy low to stabilize it.

<h3>Many Securities and Bond Swap Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the November futures started to appear, and all of them were traded in the first session. The trading was not smooth, but the swap transactions were active, which shows that speculators are more alert than before, and they are really afraid of being crushed by unexpected events when approaching the closing date. In terms of the environment, there were some rumors, but they were not significant, and they were probably outdated. The market sentiment was slightly depressed, and the market price was weak and unable to rise. No. 41 had a stronger buying interest, and the other major players had very little buying and selling. The market situation was hovering. Yesterday, the opening price fell uniformly, from 12 cents to 56 cents. In the second session, the supply and demand seemed to be balanced, and the market price fluctuated. In the afternoon, the situation was still depressed, and the swap transactions were quite active, continuing to fall by 23 cents.

<p>New Fung Foreign Company report, yesterday (27th) New York stock market due to a more optimistic outlook than before, and the expectation that autumn commerce in October will show rapid progress, so the market situation slightly rose, but gold and silver stocks fell back, because it is said that the government is gradually leaning to the right, and the plan to inflate currency is temporarily not to be implemented immediately.

<h3>Spot Yarn and Flowers on Delivery Day</h3>
<p>Spot Yarn Trend is Still Smooth</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still stable, because the sales of spot yarn can still be maintained. Although the purchases by various gangs do not have a large development, sporadic business is still uninterrupted. Because the period is in the peak season, the trend of standard yarn is depressed, and most people tend to go short, coupled with the softening of the overseas cotton market. It is found that the various gangs bought 430 bales of spot yarn throughout the day, and the market fell by 2.5 cents. Ewo Factory released 1,200 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn. According to afternoon news, the sales of spot yarn throughout the day exceeded 1,000 bales, and the market price will be supplemented tomorrow. The list of various gangs is listed below:</p>
<p>Ningbo 5 Nanjing 10</p>
<p>Inland 90 Guangdong 140</p>
<p>Changsha 80 Tianjin 45</p>
<p>Wuhu 30 Fellow Traders 30</p>
<p>Fire Machine Shenxin Enters 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>The cotton market is still weak, because the U.S. cotton fell slightly, and the market sentiment is depressed, but the amount absorbed by speculators is closed and not released, and the market is still tense, but the overall situation is not good. The standard flower for September is due for delivery, and the source on the wharf is 2,989 bales of Yao flower. The spot cotton business is average, and the factory's appetite is slightly cloudly.</p>
<p>Fire Machine Flower 38.25 Shenxin Factory entered 2,000 bales, which are being sent to the factory one after another</p>
<p>Shashi Flower 39.50 Yongan Factory entered 100 pieces, delivered in spot at the warehouse</p>
<p>Overview of September Futures Yarn Delivery</p>
<p>Delivery Price: 174 Yuan</p>
<p>Total: 4,750 Bales</p>
<p>The price of Golden Rooster standard yarn in September was 177.9 yuan when it appeared on the market on April 2. At this time, it happened to be the spring when the disappearance was disappointing, and the market price still stepped down, falling to over 173 yuan. Subsequently, because the price of Chinese coarse yarn was cheaper than that of Japanese yarn, the purchasing needs of the northern gangs were launched, and the Tianjin gang bought a lot. The market sentiment was aroused, and the market price turned from this. Until mid-July and August, the financial community saw that the price of flowers was high and the price of yarn was low. The losses of various factories were huge, and many factories stopped work and reduced work. The U.S. cotton implemented the Peng Hyde plan, and the production quantity decreased. Therefore, the buyers' intentions became stronger and stronger, and the bullish thinking became more firm. As a result, the market continued to grow higher and higher, and the highest price had seen the appearance of 188-9 yuan. As the market price rose, Japanese merchants sold off, and at the same time, some manufacturers sold on commission, and 1,650 bales of yarn were due. This batch of goods was less welcomed and was particularly suppressed. Extending to the lowest price in this month, it was seen again at 171.5 yuan. The shorts made profits and offset, and it rebounded to 4.8 yuan. The last lot was 173.5 yuan, a decrease of 7.5 yuan compared to August. As a result, the remaining 4,750 bales, the delivery price was 174 yuan, the goods were 1,650 bales of 20-count Ren Zhong, and the rest were self-delivered. The brokers' numbers and quantities for both the receiving and delivering parties are as follows:</p>

<h3>Factors for the Decline in U.S. Cotton</h3>
<p>丨Lack of Buyers Southern Sell-Off丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was weak due to lack of major buyers, poor spot sales, and southern sell-off. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 pounds, and futures prices fell by 7 to 10 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 4 to 7 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to the closing of a few bulls, but later rebounded due to brokers buying. As a result, Pingguoer rose by 0.25 rupees, and Aomula and Bailuo Creek rose by 0.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 27th):</p>

<h3>The Terrible Decline in Grains and Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the price of foreign wheat in Chicago rebounded by about 1.5 cents, and Canada fluctuated above and below 0.25 cents. After the opening price, because the delivery of this month is approaching, both the long and short parties must close out, so the market showed a calm hovering state. The prices of forward months were initially stable, but the foreign wheat market was poor, and most of the local major bulls had returned. Some factories also had a few commissioned sales, and the market uniformly returned weak. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, the market prices of each month saw a uniform decline. Because this month only had half-day trading, the non-industry long positions and a few commissioned short positions were closed out, and the market was in a state of direct decline. The smallest time was 2.23 yuan. The prices of forward months were between 4.77 and 4.78 yuan due to the combined price of spot Australian wheat, so there were more sellers and the decline was quite terrible. As a result, this month fell by 0.375 cents compared to the previous day, October fell by 0.35 cents, November fell by 0.375 cents, December fell by 0.3 cents, January fell by 0.325 cents, and February fell by 0.25 cents.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices of Foreign Wheat Cannot Match the Lengthening of Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>丨Futures Wheat Falls Again</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the opening of the market in the morning, the market prices of each month were uniformly sluggish and depressed. The prices of foreign wheat fluctuated by a few cents. The market paid little attention to this price ratio, because the spot foreign wheat is now being sold very actively, and the combined price is becoming more and more favorable due to the lengthening of the exchange rate, so the unbreakable market sentiment is extremely depressed. When the opening price was made, it was still stable, but because the buyers were very weak, it fell by 35 cents. Until the opening of the market at 10:00 a.m., the spot foreign wheat was increasingly reported to be cheaper, and the bulls withdrew one after another. The sentiment in the forward market was even more depressed, and the downward trend was also sharp. As a result, October fell by 4 cents, November fell by 8 cents, December fell by 10 cents, January fell by 8 cents, and February fell by 7 cents. In the spot wheat market, because the sales of flour have not improved and the factory's appetite is stagnant, the quotations for medium and secondary grades have also been reduced by a small amount of 0.35. Shandong Xuzhou Wuhe wheat was 3.51 yuan, secondary 0.50 yuan, Suzhou Mingguang wheat was 3.51 yuan, Daqiao wheat was 3.5 yuan, secondary 48 cents, Jiangbei Lai was 3.457 yuan, Yangzhou wheat was 3.45 yuan, secondary 43 cents, Yaowan wheat was 3.467 yuan, Hankou wheat was 3.3 yuan, totaling 24,000 bales, which were taken away by Fuxin.</p>

<h3>Xinhaige Rice Falls Sharply by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs arrived at Nos. 17 and 18, about 3,000 dan of goods, most of which were new goods, with limited milling, and the sales market gradually slackened. As a result, the market shape suddenly became weak, and the new goods were booming. The weather suddenly turned sunny, and the market sentiment was depressed. Those who opened for business, such as Xinhaige white rice, fell by as much as 45 cents, and some even fell by 67 cents. The rest of the new Luxian Jiao white rice, Jianbaijian, and new japonica rice also fell by 23 cents. Only the new Yangjian rice, because all the arrivals went to various districts in Zhejiang, and there were few arrivals, was the only one that stood still. Although the thick and thin broken japonica rice that the various gangs brought in were rare, and the Qingdao gang took the initiative to handle 4500 bales, they were restrained by the sharp drop in new goods, and they also fell by 12 cents. Only the yuan remained unchanged, but the new Yin yuan also fell by half a yuan. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various roads in Hexia had 2324 numbers of new and old goods. The sales of various goods in the market were flat, and the market price of white broken japonica rice was slightly less than 12 cents, the price of new japonica rice was slightly less than 23 cents, the new Yangjian rice was high and tired, the middle and secondary grades were slightly less than 15 cents, Baige was slightly less than 12 cents, the price of new and old guest sharp rice was slightly less than a few cents, the price of Dongxin japonica rice was slightly less than 2 cents, and the other goods were also tired.</p>
<h3>Rumors of a Sharp Drop in Saigon Pricing</h3>
<p>Guest Xian's Mainland Sales are Booming</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign rice and guest xian rice were that the spot goods were still strong, while the futures had shaken. The spot foreign rice had not been actively traded for several days. Yesterday, in addition to the mainland actively handling guest xian machine polished rice and various rices, they also inquired about spot Saigon rice, so the high-quality Saigon No. 1 rice still opened at 10.085 yuan, the small twist also reached 10.046 yuan, broken rice was 8.1 yuan, and a total of 1,350 bales were traded. Since the day before yesterday, the guest xian rice has been inquired about in the mainland. Yesterday, the appetite was even more greedy. The Zhangzhou polished rice has already sold out the newly arrived Hunan and Hubei new goods, and the various rices have also been sold through. A total of about 4,000 bales were handled. Ningbo also responded to 3400 bales of Shashi polished rice. Nearly 1,000 bales of polished rice were handled in this street. The digestion was strong, and the market had already seen a turnaround. Yesterday, the river rice and the period foreign rice increased and saw a decline, while the noodles and guest xian rice were instead quite strong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiujiang gang of term foreign rice commissioned Xie Daheng to handle 200 tons of September term Saigon, and the mainland street went to 100 tons in October and 500 tons in November, all of which were return funds and settlement goods. The market could have been led by the guest xian rice and the spot foreign rice, but the market rumors yesterday said that a certain foreign company received a telegram from Annam, saying that the contract price for Saigon's October and November mixed futures had suddenly dropped to 4.25 yuan, a decrease of more than half a yuan compared to the previous telegram of 4.85 yuan. Based on one stone, the difference is nearly a yuan. This statement has not been formally verified, but it has been strongly promoted in the market, so there are suspicions that speculators are acting. Therefore, the 9-month return rice also opened at 4.6 yuan (there has been no market for many days, and the price opened at 4.05 yuan a few days ago, a decrease of 4.5 cents), October at 4.75 yuan, and November at 4.86 yuan. Therefore, the market price should be 56 cents and nearly cents lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Tin Factories are Being Shipped Continuously</h3>
<p>As the end of the month has arrived, the various silk factories in Wuxi are committed to selling off the term silk for this month and should be delivered on schedule, so they are all being loaded onto trucks and shipped to Shanghai. In the past week, a total of 205 pieces of Baitangjing, such as Yue Tu and San Tiao Wu brands, have been loaded and sent to the Shanghai warehouse for delivery. In the overseas raw silk market, the actual sales of Chinese silk remain unchanged, the European and American silk telegrams have not been forwarded, and although the European houses in Shanghai have squeezed their appetites, the manufacturers' prices are small and difficult to sell. Yesterday, only Renji and others entered 20 packages of Shanghai Baitangjing, and the price remained stable.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea European Sales are Slightly Moving</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the local Shanghai foreign tea market, the Zhenmei green tea from Luzhuang, Tuzhuang, and other roads saw slightly active sales in Europe. English merchants Jinlong Baochang Xiehe Fushi and most other traders have started to handle both the core-picking and ordinary items. Tianxiang and Tianyu and other firms have also sent out telegrams, and the market seems to have turned slightly better than before. However, in the opening market, Wuyuan Zhenmei fell to around 80 yuan, Tunxi Zhenmei fell to 7677 yuan, and Shexian Zhenmei fell to 6364 yuan. The losses suffered by Chinese tea merchants are no less than 340 yuan per dan, and the situation is extremely difficult.</p>

<h3>The Secret of Writing Books</h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>In (The Art of Bookmaking) it is said that at first, he did not understand why writers without talent produced so prolifically. One day, he went to the British Museum in England and saw two types of people making books: one who specialized in collecting fragments of ancient English texts left behind by bookworms to create a book, and another who took a few lines from one book and a few lines from another to create a book. Only then did he understand the art of bookmaking.</p>
<p>In China (perhaps in all countries), those who write books similar to the first type are those who study tortoise shells, bronzes, and thread-bound books from the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period all the way to the Qing Dynasty. This group of scholars relies on the works of the deceased, extracting materials from them for research, explanation, and discussion to make a living. Naturally, the works of the ancients are not copyrighted. Even if you distribute them on their behalf and pocket the money, the ancients will not sue you or ask for royalties. It will definitely not be like what Owen imagined, with the ghosts of ancient writers jumping down from the walls one by one, stripping a modern professor of his clothes to reveal his true form, and exposing the secrets of a literary figure, leaving him in a sorry state! Master Yutang is, after all, an old fox (stealing royalties from the ancients to support my wife and children, what's wrong with that?) (That's the gist of it), truly revealing the mystery.</p>
<p>Those who write books similar to the second type are naturally people like us who make a living from newspapers and magazines. In China today, apart from purely literary publications, most of the materials in political and economic publications rely on newspapers. Therefore, the tools we need to make a living are just a few newspapers, a pair of scissors, a bottle of paste, and a scrapbook for pasting newspaper clippings. At most, we add some organizing work and use a little brainpower to explain the raw materials, and then we have a long article that can be sold for money. If this work is done consistently, after a few years, it may become a voluminous work of hundreds of thousands of words. Even though your materials are cut from newspapers with scissors, no one dares to question you or sue you.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another type of book writer that Owen did not mention. Perhaps in Owen's time, this was not very prevalent. But in China, this method of writing books has special advantages. That is, if you understand foreign languages, you can take the works of foreign writers and translate them entirely or copy parts of them to create your own book. China is not a member of the international copyright convention, so it is of course no problem to copy and translate the works of dead foreign writers. Even if the writer is still alive, he will not frown upon you or sue you if you copy and translate his works.</p>
<p>However, those who aspire to write books should never steal materials from domestic writers who are still alive. Because the works of writers who are still alive, although not very brilliant, and even stolen from others, if you steal their works and they find out, they will put on a stern face and use their authority as scholars to make things difficult for you. As a result, you will not only waste your efforts and fail to become famous, but you will also not receive any royalties, and you will eventually be unable to move forward and no longer be able to join the ranks of scholars.</p>
<p>That's the secret of writing books. It's not a secret, nor is it a dark secret. It's just the way things have always been.</p>
<p>As for the quality of a book, it does not depend on whether you plagiarize or not, but on whether you can refine and process the plagiarized materials. If you can, like Macbeth, find a piece here (frog's toe), and a piece there (lizard's tail), mix them with monkey's blood, put them in a magician's cauldron (a person's brain), and make organic food or medicine, then you will definitely be welcomed.</p>
<h3>Wife's Hospitalization</h3>
<p>— Hui Ying</p>
<p>On this day, my wife had just finished class and, according to her, still had to correct a few exercise books, but the little animal in her belly was starting to move. She was in pain for quite a while, even crying.</p>
<p>According to the doctor's examination, the due date was in the next few days. I became anxious and told my wife to go to the hospital to get checked and be admitted if necessary.</p>
<p>My wife, in great pain, got into a rickshaw (why don't we have a car?). She left, leaving me with endless fear. Two past events quickly flashed through my mind:</p>
<p>Didn't XX's lover die from childbirth? And wasn't Lu Yin, who recently passed away, also die from childbirth? Oh, this matter...</p>
<p>I dared not think about it anymore. Even so, I still seemed to see my wife groaning in pain in the hospital.</p>
<p>(Why didn't I go with her!) I regretted it, but after a while, I realized that this regret was unnecessary. The reason my wife went to the hospital alone, without asking me to go with her, was because she was worried about money.</p>
<p>Originally, people like us who have difficulty maintaining our lives have no reason to have children. God, why can't we have a child? Is having children the exclusive right of a certain type of people in this world? I don't accept it. This matter...</p>
<p>I was about to continue thinking, thinking of myself as a useless man who couldn't make money (actually, it's because this society doesn't give me the opportunity to make money), when my wife came back. She still had the painful belly.</p>
<p>(What, didn't you see the doctor?)</p>
<p>Seeing her like this, I quickly asked.</p>
<p>(The time was up.)</p>
<p>(Didn't I tell you to ask to be hospitalized if the time was up?)</p>
<p>(It costs two dollars for a special registration.)</p>
<p>(What, does hospitalization also require registration, a special registration?)</p>
<p>I really doubted this so-called semi-charitable hospital, and at the same time felt inexplicable anger. If we had money, what would two dollars be? To be honest, if we had money, we wouldn't be prepared to stay in this charitable hospital. Now, the word "charity" really needs to be re-evaluated.</p>
<p>My wife's belly was hurting even more severely. She couldn't speak, just bent over, holding her belly and crying. I supported her and asked:</p>
<p>(Then, how about going to XX Hospital? Doesn't it not require a special registration for hospitalization there?)</p>
<p>My wife couldn't answer, but she nodded. This time, I had to go with her. I would spend the extra rickshaw fare for one person because I didn't trust her! I really wanted to starve myself for a few days and save some money to hire a car for her to sit in, but my wife rejected my idea.</p>
<p>When we arrived at XX Hospital, I was very nervous, afraid of having to pay a special registration fee again. People without money are constantly thinking about money, and have simply become pitiful slaves to money. Thank God, this hospital didn't charge a special registration fee, and I felt much relieved.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, a new fear came:</p>
<p>(Will she pass this difficult time safely, or will she become an unfortunate victim?)</p>
<p>We walked into Room XXX. My wife was crying, shouting in pain. My heart was pounding. Fear, fear, what was I afraid of? ...</p>
<h3>"Jintan, Do You Want to Buy Jintan?"</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Between Friends</h3>
<p>— Chen Bibing</p>
<p>Having drifted at sea for ten years, what I have heard or seen – especially what I have experienced – always makes me feel that dealing with people seems easy at first, but is actually very mysterious.</p>
<p>Human beings are originally divided into many kinds. There are the good, and the even better; there are the evil, and the even more evil. But most human beings are neither good nor evil.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because of similar interests, or perhaps it is because of emotional closeness, that some people, originally from different environments, can actually become close friends.</p>
<p>And some people, who originally worked together in the same environment, nevertheless have different opinions and become enemies.</p>
<p>Instead of saying it is a meeting of minds, it would be better to say it is a convergence of interests. Close friends today, enemies tomorrow; enemies tomorrow, close friends the day after tomorrow. These kinds of things are really common. Originally, this is not surprising. In this age of money worship, all human relationships are material, not spiritual. Therefore, some people hold a fixed view, which is: (Everyone is bad, only money is good.) They have no sympathy for anyone. If you complain to them, they will reply, (They used to be even more painful than you.) They always think that pain is something everyone should have – even if they can help you, they are still thinking of other aspects. Their treatment of you is so harsh that it is simply indescribable. The motive for this kind of help is definitely not that they are helping you; it is that they are using your painful situation as a weakness, so they can buy a large amount of your labor with a small amount of money.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, making friends does have a time and space element. Many people can only share hardship, not happiness; many people can only share happiness, but not hardship. Snobbery is inevitable in this society, even among family members, fathers, sons, and brothers, let alone friends? Therefore, some people have one face when they come to ask you for help, and another face when you go to beg them. From my own experience, when you have the means, friends will volunteer to undertake things that do not require them to bear any burden; but when you are frustrated and in trouble, friends will refuse even things that do not require much effort. If you say that this kind of behavior is snobbish, it certainly is; but if you say that his behavior is unethical, he himself will never admit it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, misunderstandings between friends are also inevitable. This is even more likely to happen among people who are quick-witted, rough in temperament, or experience a lot of stimulation. Very often, a major conflict arises from a very small matter – even to the point of mistaking good intentions for malice, and the deeper the love, the more intense the hate. As a result, nothing else but severing the relationship is left. This is very heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Even more, some people suffer from megalomania and like to lie – even to the point of fabricating things out of thin air. Sometimes financial dealings between close friends are unavoidable, but some friends use this to brag everywhere, boasting to other friends, thinking that it is the greatest generosity on his part. As a result, good intentions are only taken as malice. Money or a meal of friendship has a price, but the reputation of others has no price to estimate. Therefore, inviting friends to dinner or financial dealings are not necessarily essential means of making friends.</p>
<p>A gentleman's friendship is as light as water. Some people, before any accidents happen, are very plain when dealing with you, and their attitude is very moderate. When there is something to say, they will say it; when there is nothing to say, they will not deliberately flatter people. However, when any friend encounters an unexpected disaster and asks for their help, they are extremely sincere in their attitude, and they will always help you to the best of their ability. They will not despise you because you are bankrupt. On the contrary, they will have even greater sympathy for you. Their friendship will be even more in accord, exceeding the usual social interactions by more than double. These people are indeed worth befriending, but it is difficult to find one in a hundred people – most ordinary people are snobbish.</p>
<p>There are also some friends who are very mediocre and dispirited when they are down on their luck, but when they are successful and developed, they have an air of arrogance. Their voices become louder, their spirits become invigorated, and they even stand tall with their chests puffed out when they walk. When you go to see them, they will clearly have nothing to do, but they will pretend to be very busy, making you wait in the reception room for one or two hours, or even deliberately scolding servants in front of you to show their dignity and power.</p>
<p>And there are others who don't offend anyone and always have a smile on their face, but if you are in a difficult situation and ask them for a loan, they will resolutely refuse. Even if it is something they can do with no effort and that would not harm their budget in the slightest, they will refuse regardless of the reason – it is clear that you are equals, but the moment you ask them for money, they think you are vulgar and inferior to them.</p>
<p>But then there are some who have no money in their pockets, but when a friend asks for a loan, their pain is actually greater than that of the person borrowing the money. Some will promise to meet in the afternoon or the next day, and then pawn their clothes to help their friend.</p>
<p>Still others, within the scope of cheap help, may give you some non-monetary assistance, but if you ask for a loan, a single cent is impossible.</p>
<p>Although there are many kinds of people described above, most people in the world are neither good nor bad. They may give you a little help that requires no effort, but extravagant hopes are impossible.</p>
<p>Like me, I am born vulgar. I help others when I have money, and I am helped by others when I have no money. For good people, even if I know that there is no practical reward other than gratitude in my heart, I will treat them well. For bad people, even if I know that they are evil, I will have no acts of revenge other than cursing them in my heart. However, in modern society, good people always suffer losses, and bad people always gain advantages. This is why, invisibly, people are encouraged to do evil, so it is even more difficult for young people to live in the world.</p>
<h3>Mr. Village Head (10) (4)</h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>Winterborn, limping, sat in the pavilion for a full hour. Mr. Village Head Feng Wen’s cries were sent from the street. Dragging himself out of a rather leisurely, and also quite noble, state, knowing that there was some errand he had to do, at that time, Winterborn, limping, waved his ginger-joint-like hand, scolding to himself and for his own hearing:</p>
<p>(Damn it, being a village policeman is really not a job for humans! A mangy dog!)</p>
<p>Winterborn, limping, resumed his cane-like walking style, and went.</p>
<p>Mr. Village Head Feng Wen, was at Mr. Dasheng’s Yusheng Shop.</p>
<p>This Yusheng Shop, was originally Mr. Feng Wen’s father’s inheritance. Now, together with the house, utensils and goods, it was all sold to Mr. Dasheng.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Wen didn’t have capital, couldn’t match the goods; and also couldn’t afford to match the goods. Three copper coins for yellow sugar, two copper coins for needles, most buyers were so piecemeal. But if you ran into a brick wall with the buyers a few times, the buyers would come to your door less. Mr. Feng Wen’s era of Yusheng Shop, just went out like that.</p>
<p>Mr. Dasheng, however, had a plan.</p>
<p>For years, the village had been plagued by floods every year. (The mid-July great flood had already become an old saying. But when a flood occurred, the bridges and dikes everywhere were always washed away in large part. The great flood of mid-July the year before broke the rule; a Chang'an Bridge at the head of Niutou Village, which had not been washed down for decades, was actually washed away (broke the water).</p>
<p>Chang'an Bridge was a huge building more than ten zhang high. Entirely made of square blocks of stone slabs. A continuous series of five large ring holes. At the junction of ring hole and ring hole, were built rows of (water breakers). Triangle cones that looked like that, with the pointed mouths facing outwards, breaking and dividing the water flow.</p>
<p>That day, three days after the great flood, Mr. Dasheng led the clan chief, standing on the bridge looking. Stone railings surrounded both sides of the bridge, and each stone pillar was carved with a lion, white elephant, and the like. Mr. Dasheng hugged the stone pillar, sighing and saying:</p>
<p>(If we don't repair this water breaker this year, perhaps next year this arch bridge will be difficult to preserve.)</p>
<p>(Yes.) The clan chief, as usual, took Mr. Dasheng's opinion as his own.</p>
<p>(If this arch bridge is not preserved, my grandfather's efforts will have been wasted, not to mention; the feng shui of Niutou Village will also be broken.</p>
<p>(It should be repaired, it should be repaired, feng shui is important.) The clan chief answered even more affirmatively.</p>

<h3>Arms Dealers Manipulate Congressional Elections</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Not many days ago, according to reports, the US Senate Arms Investigation Committee discovered that US arms dealers have a secret to manipulate congressional elections. This can be said to be a major disgrace in recent democratic politics. In fact, the secrets of so-called democratic politics have long been spied by the general public. The so-called congressmen are nothing more than tools of a few capitalists. This point has long been clearly known to the world. And now, the fact that US arms dealers manipulate congressional elections proves even more clearly what so-called democratic politics really is.</p>
<p>However, there is an even more important point here. What kind of politics does the manipulation of congressional elections by arms dealers represent? Obviously, this means that the current politics, not only in the United States, but in any country in the world, have embarked on the most tense stage of war preparations. Therefore, arms dealers are responding to this political trend and are particularly active. The activity of arms dealers precisely indicates that the present is an era in urgent need of arms; arms in this era are the most needed necessities of any country in the world. In this way, we can see how the world today is being pushed day by day into a very thick cloud of war.</p>
<h3>Raincoat</h3>
<p>— Hong Ben</p>
<p>I suddenly woke up from the shock of rain hitting the window lattice and realized that today was the third day of registration, and things were so busy that I had to hurry. I planned to find a way to compensate for this loss in the future.</p>
<p>I wiped my face hastily and saw that the watch was already half past seven. If I didn't hurry, I wouldn't be able to squeeze through the crowded office door. So I took two steps at a time and walked down the three turns and eighteen bends of the building, standing still at the door. The rain was pouring down. I just thought that if this rain had fallen a month and a half earlier, it would not only be a welcome rain, but literally a drop of rice, a life. I waited and waited, but the rain fell even harder. Looking at my watch again, it was already a quarter past eight. I had no choice but to brave the rain and run to the office. The office was so far from the dormitory that I ran for about five minutes, panting heavily before I got there, my whole body already like a drowned chicken. Fortunately, the rain lessened during lunch, so I returned to the dormitory. After changing my clothes, I thought of two things to avoid the rain, one was an umbrella (sun umbrella or rain umbrella), and the other was a raincoat. I originally had both of these things, but the umbrella was borrowed by a friend, so I thought of the raincoat that had been in my suitcase for a long time.</p>
<p>Speaking of this raincoat, it had always been (prepared but not used), but this time it was necessary to take it out. Coincidentally, the rain started pouring down again after lunch. At this time, I was fearless. When office hours arrived, I put on my raincoat and ran downstairs. But because I lacked a rain hat on my head, I still had to run fast when I walked out the door. When I got to the office and took off my raincoat, I found that my clothes were as wet as when I ran in the rain.</p>
<p>So I hesitated. Because it was the last day of registration and it was raining heavily, there were very few people registering in the afternoon. I took advantage of this free time to concentrate on thinking about why the raincoat couldn't keep out the rain. Although the goods were not fashionable, the material was good, and it was brand new, even though it had been in the suitcase for almost two years and had never been formally used. I thought about it for a long time, but the answer was still not very reliable. A raincoat is definitely for keeping out the rain, and it can keep out the rain. But the facts were too disturbing. My brand new raincoat couldn't keep out the rain.</p>
<p>After leaving the office and returning to the dormitory, I thought about it for a long time before I understood the reason.</p>
<p>Probably (actually, I should use a definitive term) people in the city wear raincoats in the rain also view it as a decoration, or at least as something fun to wear. If a fashionable person strolls slowly in the rain, letting their expensive clothes get wet in front of everyone, they will inevitably be scolded as (stupid). If they scurry around in the streets, they may avoid getting their clothes wet, but they will inevitably be ridiculed as (idiots), (country bumpkins). Neither of these is a good solution.</p>
<p>But most people in the city have such a strange temper that they don't like to use umbrellas in the rain. Just look at the Western-dressed friends who are busy in the streets. Who is carrying an umbrella? Although umbrellas are good for keeping out the rain, people in the city view them as warts. In order to avoid the above two kinds of embarrassment, they put on raincoats and abandon the tacky umbrella, not caring if their clothes get wet.</p>
<p>In fact, the name of this raincoat is not wrong, but it can't keep out the rain. It is originally a special product for rich gentlemen. For example, when they are traveling in the rain in a car or charter, from indoors to the car, or from the car to the room, they are afraid that one or two drops of water will drip onto their clothes or neck, making them uncomfortable, so they wear raincoats to shield themselves. People like this naturally need to use this kind of raincoat. Otherwise, raincoats are useless. But people in the city like to imitate (the style of the Duke of Mandeville), so everyone wears them, and it becomes a kind of decoration for rainy days.</p>
<h3>Change</h3>
<p>— Jin Ren</p>
<p>I accidentally found a faded photo in a suitcase that had traveled through three passes and six docks. It was a photo I took when I graduated from elementary school. The back was marked with the words "Taken in the summer of the ninth year of the Republic of China in XX, etc." I was happy for a while and put it in the mirror frame on my desk. Compared with my most recent photo, there was simply no resemblance.</p>
<p>From the ninth year of the Republic of China to now, this long distance, I have changed in every way. People say to me; of course, I myself am very clear about understanding that I have gone from the innocent childhood to the middle age formed by society. This gradual change, the dissimilarity of the two photos is only on the surface. But to what extent have I changed? The most obvious is that I was driven out of my family. This kind of family conflict, I don't need to use the facts as a basis, I was so wrong that I couldn't stand in my hometown. So I started to change.</p>
<p>This suitcase of mine can be used as strong evidence. Its clean surroundings have been swallowed up by the names of many stations and wharves; as for whether the owner of this suitcase has become equally unclear, some people are eager to come forward to prove it, saying: (You don't even want your family, I really can't see that this child would change like this!) Naturally, I have changed like this, and the two photos have nothing in common!</p>
<p>This time, by a chance opportunity, many of my childhood companions gathered together. Apart from the fact that I had changed to this state, I felt that everyone had changed. If a photo taken at that time had not been lost, I think everyone who saw it would have shouted: (I have changed!) But our three days together were still like when we were kids, talking and laughing, messing around, taking small advantages, and it was as if no one had changed; and one of our oldest sisters said: (Jin Di still has the same old temper.)</p>
<p>It can be seen that I have not changed to (this state). So I carefully played with the two photos, wanting to solve this question of change or no change. The person who said I had changed to (this state), naturally he saw that I was already (this state), otherwise, I have no conflict of interest with him at all, why would he say that? The sister who said I still have the same old temper, we grew up together. After being separated for so many years, her words are naturally not to make fun of me after we met for three days; so, how to solve this problem?</p>
<p>Change or no change depends on me personally. I can't change or not change because people say I change or not change. Although these two photos have nothing in common, wasn't it me (one) who took the photos? Then what does change or no change have to do with other people? (Excerpt from diary)</p>
<h3>Wandering the Streets of Shanghai on an Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— A Wanderer</p>
<p>Autumn night, wandering the streets of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Due to business, I missed a train; looking for a friend, I ran into a wall. Thus, under the chilling autumn wind, I ended up tasting the flavor of this great city’s black magic night.</p>
<p>Because of the cold shrinking of my wallet, enjoying</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>pleasures in this great city is not meant for me. Where should I go? For someone used to living in the countryside, and also facing economic panic, it’s truly difficult to decide!</p>
<p>So I bought a book and sat in a tea house for a full two hours. Lonely, I immersed my soul in the book. Suddenly startled, I realized the clock on the wall was pointing to eleven. (Find a place to sleep.) With a decision made, I strolled onto the streets of Shanghai.</p>
<p>I saw that streetcars were gradually becoming sparse, but the cars of the wealthy seemed not to have decreased. A gust of autumn night's cold wind blew around me, and I suddenly felt very cold. Women of the night crowded the streetsides, smiling and soliciting customers. A wave of urban shudder rose in my heart.</p>
<p>(What are the nights like at the dance halls?)</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange feeling rose in my heart. So I strolled to the edge of the Racecourse, the grand opening of the Paramount Theatre had just finished dispersing its customers, and cars lined up and drove off. The small entrance of the Grand Shanghai Ballroom caught my eye, and the solemn class structure intimidated me. I turned around. I ran to the Metropole. Upon entering, I saw clusters of ghosts rolling around under dim lights. Then I suddenly turned around again; I was once again spat out onto the streets of Shanghai.</p>
<p>(What to do?)</p>
<p>(Better find a place to sleep.)</p>
<p>So I wandered aimlessly on Nanjing Road. I saw that cars were becoming increasingly sparse; people were also much fewer. I dragged my footsteps step by step, feeling the heaviness of my legs. Upon reaching the Huangpu Bund, a burst of greyish-white moonlight suddenly brought a cold autumn wind, I shivered, and woke up my dazed mind.</p>
<p>(How did I end up here?)</p>
<p>(Call a rickshaw, my legs are a bit out of control!)</p>
<p>So I sat in the car, passing through the heart of Shanghai at night. The cold, desolate streets really made me suspect that this was not urban Shanghai. And the constant cold wind made me shiver even more.</p>
<p>The Suzhou Creek lay in Shanghai’s heart in dim slumber. A beggar pulled my rickshaw, receiving two copper coins from my longing for sleep.</p>
<p>(You, a lowly citizen of the city, why weren't you born as the son of a wealthy family?)</p>
<p>Just as I was ridiculing my own stupid words in my stomach, the car stopped in front of the Jiande Apartment.</p>
<p>I rang the bell, and settled myself in a room.</p>
<p>Shanghai, is Shanghai for the rich! Not to mention the petty bourgeoisie, even a small asset class person has no blessings to enjoy the nights of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The taste of a night of wandering, is deeply imprinted in my heart.</p>
